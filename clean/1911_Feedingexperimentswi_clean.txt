unter der haut hervor und schliesslich schienen die tiere nur noch aus haut und knochen zu bestehen trotzdem waren die hunde nicht etwa schwach im gegenteil sie waren lebhaft liefen und sprangen umher oft mehr als ihre normalen brudertiere die ein zwei oder dreimal zo grosses korpergewicht zu bewaltigen hatten dieser zustand zunehmender abmagerung unter standiger grossen langen und hohenzunahme bei konstantbleiben des gewichtes dauerte je nach dem grade dernahrungs entziehung ungefahr bis monate wurde jetzt wenn das tier vollig abgemagert war die nahrungsmenge weiter gering belassen wie vorher ging das tier unter geringem gewichtsverlust volliger inanition zugrunde wurde aber jetzt die nahrungsmenge etwas erhoht wie bei hund hielt sich das tier zwar voukommen abgemagert aber auf konstantem gewicht und jetzt erweist sich dieser gewichtsstillstand als identisch mit wachstums stand der hund ist noch weitere monate auf dem gleichen gewicht gehalten worden ohne dass sich nun seinem aussehen nennenswerte aenderungen konstatieren liessen durch geeignete nahrungsbeschrankung gelingt es wachsende hunde beliebig lange auf konstantem gewicht zu halten natiirligh darf man nicht allzu junge tiere nehmen wahrend dieses gewichtsstillstandes gehen aber gewaltige umwandlungen im tierkorper vor die sich ausserlich dem fortschreitenden langen und hohenwachstum und der abmagerung dokumentieren enbar ist trotz des gewichtsstillstandes das skelett weiter gewachsen und hat nicht nur grosse sondern auch masse zugenommen folg lich miissen andere korpergebilde wie haut fleisch organe usw gewicht
