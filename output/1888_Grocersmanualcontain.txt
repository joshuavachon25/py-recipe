PREFACE. 



The object in writing the Grocers' Manual has 
been to give a collection of good recipes, 
formulas and processes of practical application 
in the manufacture of Grocers' Sundries. The 
directions and descriptions have been given in 
simple language. The technical and scientific 
are not used to any extent. Care has been 
taken that only the best and latest recipes and 
best discoveries have been used. In using the 
recipes be careful to follow the directions and 
proportions exactly. In experimenting use small 
quantities. If the first trial is not a success, try 
again. It will prove that some mistake has been 
made, as these formulas have all been practically 
proven correct.

GROCERS' MANUAL- 



BAKING POWDER. 

There are many ways to make good bak- 
ing powder, and none are bad, notwithstanding 
what is said about the unhealthfulness of certain 
kinds by several large manufacturers, who find 
fault with all but those made by themselves. The 
writer of this, after years of experience in the 
manufacture, has yet to find an unhealthful baking 
powder. Even should the powder be compounded 
wrongly, none of all the materials used in its 
manufacture, are injurious at all, after being 
baked. Heat and water chemically change the 
different ingredients excepting the filler, which, 
being either corn-starch, potato, wheat or rice 
flour, are certainly not injurious. All bak- 
ing powders generate the same kind of gas, 
namely — carbonic acid gas. This is the leaven- 
ing power in the dough, being distributed 
through the flour in minute particles as baking 
powder in the dry state. After v/etting the mass 
the generation of the gas begins, causing the 
dough to swell, in which state it must be baked 

9

before the gas escapes. Cream of tartar and soda 
baking powder generate carbonic acid gas when 
dampened and leaves a residue, not cream of tar- 
tar or soda, for these have been changed by the 
combustion caused by the moisture, but the res- 
idue is Rochelle salts. Alum and soda bak- 
ing powder generates the same gas, and where 
the quality is of the best, a little more of it. 
The residue in this case is neither alum nor soda, 
but a small amount of Glauber's salts. The 
quantity of these salts is so small that to get 
enough to make one dose for medicine, a 
man would have to consume at one meal 
over a peck of biscuits. The baking pow4er 
that is to be the future powder of the world [and 
is to a great extent of the present] is a combi- 
nation of alum, soda and acid phosphate. Alum 
and soda, though being the strongest, is apt 
when used in stiff dough, on account of insuffi- 
cient moisture being used, or too much powder 
to the amount of flour, to cause a bitter taste. 
This is owing to incomplete combustion. The 
phosphate being the purest of all materials [leav- 
ing the least residue] loses its strength when 
brought into great contact with soda, which it 
must be when used by itself, as it requires two 



grocers' manual. II 

pounds to one pound of soda, consequently leav- 
ing very little room for the filler to keep it cool. 
This formula is recommended above all oth- 
ers. It is cheap, strong from the alum, steady 
also from the alum, as it only releases its gas en- 
tirely when exposed to the heat of the oven. 
Quick rising, from the prompt elimination of the 
gas by the phosphates, which has also a neutral- 
izing effect, when too much powder is used, or 
too little mxoisture employed in mixino-. 

The Filler, (If starch) should be the chemi- 
cal corn starch, powdered. It can be had of 
any starch manufacturer, in one or more barrel 
lots. It is the same that is sold in one pound 
packages, and known as corn starch. It should 
be sifted into the mixer first. 

The Sifter. All the material should be 
sifted through a No. 24 to 50 mesh sieve to re- 
duce all the ingredients to the same fineness. 

The Mixer, For small quantities a drum or 
barrel churn can be used, if a regular mixer is 
not to be had. 

The Soda should not be left standing after 
sifting, as it cakes very quickly. Sift into the 
starch, and if not ready to place in the other 
ingredients, mfx it with the starch, when it can 
be left standing indefinitely.

Process. Sift your filler into the mixer, 
then sift in the soda, C. T. S. and phosphate in 
succession. If a churn is used, fasten the head 
securely, and revolve it slowly for fifteen min- 
utes, when the powder will be finished. 

Sifters and Mixers, There have been pat- 
ented several combined machines for this pur- 
pose. The best, and indeed a good machine is 
the Mtinter Sifter and Mixer. Never fill the 
mixer overhalf full. If more is put in, the mix- 
ing is liable to be defective.

Instructions for Mixing Baking Powder, 
Starch, Self-Raising Flour, Etc. 

A good mixer for new beginners and those 
doing a small business, is a five to twenty gal- 
lon tumbling drum churn, with a large mouth 
and good fitting lid. Never fill it over half 
full ; when the proportions for the mixer are too 
large reduce them to fit. Turn mixer over 
slowly ; one hundred and fifty times will mix 
sufficiently. 

How TO Pack Baking Powder. 
Baking Powd^^IisJpa^^d in tin usually. In 
fact, any powder \kit the clear alum powder 
will not keep very long without it is packed in 
tin cans and carefully labeled to keep the air and 
dampness from entering at the seams and joints. 
Always pack full weight. If bulk baking powder 
is wanted v/here it will not be sold rapidly, 
always give the Alum Baking Powder, or the 
One Spoon Alum Powder.

Directions, — Mix with cold water or milk, and 
bake on a hot griddle at once.

Buckwheat flour 140 '* 

Proceed as on page 12. Buckwheat being a 
heavier flour requires more of the aerating ma- 
terial than wheat flour. Directions for use same 
as for Self-Raising Wheat Flour. 

STARCH. 

Corn Starch. — There are two kinds of corn 
starch used in the manufacture of sundries, 
chemicaled and unchemicaled. The former is 
called sometimes sweet starch, the latter, sour 
starch. The first only should be used for corn 
starch in packages, for lump starch in packages 
and bulk, and for Baking Powder filler. It is 
not quite as white, having generally a slight 
yellowish cast, and* is not subject to climatic 
changes to the extent that the other is ; the un- 



i6 • grocers' makual. 

chemicaled starch is better adapted for general 
laundry purposes, and is used almost exclusively 
by the large steam laundries. It is whiter and 
more nearly resembles wheat starch in its results, 
but liable at all times without being mixed with 
some other substance, to get a sour and musty 
smell with age. 

Wheat Starch is the whitest, and contains 
the most stiffening of any of the starches. Is 
used principally in preparing new linen products 
for the market. 

Potato Starch, is as its name indicates, made 
from potatoes. Can be used for all purposes 
that other starches are used for, but is used 
principally for food. 

Dextrine. — It is manufactured from Potato 
Starch, and is a substitute for gum arabic which 
it resembles in its results. The yellow Dextrine 
is used for making mucilage and gumming en- 
velopes. The white Dextrine only must be 
used in starch. 

Prepared Laundry Starch. — A recent in- 
vention. 

Wheat Starch 50 Pounds. 

Unchemicaled Corn Starch 35

Powdered Soapstone (Talc) 10 

The Talc, being of a soapy or slippery nature, 

assists in ironing. The first two articles 

alone make a good starch ; it is much superior 

to the old starching process. 

Starch Packing. — Corn Starch for food is 
packed, one pound in package, 40 to a case. 
Prepared Laundry is packed 12 ozs. to a pack- 
age, and from 40 to 64 in a case ; as it goes 
farther in starching than the old way, none can 
find fault with the short pound, besides it can be 
sold at a round price adjusting profits satisfact- 
orily to all concerned.

FLAVORING EXTRACTS. 

Their Manufacture, Etc. 

Water Bath (a glue pot is a water bath). — 
Take a kettle or pail large enough to hold an- 
other pail, kettle or jug inside of it, leaving an 
inch or more space all around it. Place in the 
bottom about one inch of coarse gravel. Put in 
water sufficient and place it over a slow fire, 
then set the vessel and contents to be digested 
into this. If a bottle or jug, remove the cork. 
Care should be taken not to let extracts boil. 
Alcohol in the mass will boil at a lower temper- 
ature than if there was no alcohol in it. 

Oil Lemon and other essential oils should 
always be fresh. Old Oil Lemon in extracts 
produces a turpentine flavor and taste. 



GROCERS MANUAL. I9 

Alcohol. — Should be the best to be had. 
Deodorized alcohol is preferable in all cases. It 
can be bought at all distilleries and rectifying 
houses, and also at all wholesale drug houses. 

Magnesia Carbonate is a very necessary help 
in reducinof the oils. Mix the oil and a small 
amount of alcohol together, then crush magnesia 
into it in a mortar until a thin, paste-like sub- 
stance is the result. It cuts the oil into more 
minute particles than if alcohol alone is used. 

Filtering. 

Use a funnel for ordinary work and druggists' 
filtering paper; fold the paper together so it will 
fit to the shape of the funnel, set the funnel into 
a clean jar or bottle, pour in the material. If 
lemon is cloudy let stand a day or two when it 
will clear of its own accord. If not clear enough 
in one filterinof filter aofain. 

Felt bag filter is used for cheap extracts 
where quantity and not quality is desired. 
Should have one for each flavor. They are used 
in a funnel in place of the paper. 

Artificial flavors should not be filtered. 
If It can be avoided, filter the alcohol and water 
beforehand if needed, the ethers are so volatile

Mix one pint of alcohol and the oil together, 
then triturate in a mortar with magnesia enough 
to thoroughly cut the whole and incorporate it 
into a thin paste. Pour on it a quart of alcohol, 
place it in a bottle, cork tight, and let digest for 
forty-eight hours. Mix the balance of the alco- 
hol and the water together. Have the water 
warm, shake them well and add it to the original 
mass, color with Yellow Aniline, filter through 
paper. If time is brief instead of letting stand for- 
ty-eight hours, it can be given the hot water bath 
for three or four hours ; not quite to the boiling 
point will do as well. The magnesia can be saved 
to use again.

Small bottles can be best filled by placing 
them in rows on a pan or large plate (to catch 
the waste or overflow) in 2 or 3 doz. lots. 
Use a soft one-fourth inch rubber tube as a siphon, 
setting the bulk on a box or shelf a few inches 
higher than the table you are working on. 

This can also be done to good advantage 
when filling blueing, sweet oil, or any other 
liquids. Any second hand bottle cleaned thor-

42 grocers' MANUAL. 

To Pack Seeds, Farinaceous P'^oods, Etc. 
IN Pasteboard Packages. 

F'irst determine what shape you want to put 
your goods up in, how high a package, how 
wide and how deep. You then order from any 
paper box maker the shells the size you want. 

He will also furnish you with the tops, bot- 
toms, and the square sheets of manilla paper for 
the caps. The box maker will send you the 
shells, scored on the four corners, lapped and 
glued together ; you then need a form. It is a 
block of wood that will fit loosely inside the 
shell. Take a piece of board, say one foot long 
and six inches wide ; attach the block in an up- 
right position pa the middle of the board by 
driving a couple nails into it from the under side 
of the board. Open the shell and pass it over 
the block. 

Now this block must be just the thickness 
of pasteboard, shorter than the shell ; before 
you push the shell clear down over the block, 
take one of the ends and place it inside the 
shell down on the block; then shove the shell all 
the way down, thereby bringing the top of the 
shell just even with the top of the pasteboard 
end. You then prepare your caps which have 



grocers' manual, 43 

a margin over the net size of the top of one- 
half inch all around. Take the dry cap, put 
some thin paste on it ; lay another cap on that, 
paste it, and lay another until you have about 
fifty pasted on both sides, then turn the pile 
of them over. Put some fresh paste on the hrst 
one before picking it up, then lay the fresh side 
down on the top of the shell, turn down the sides 
and crease in at ends, then fasten the ends 
down by rubbing over it gently with the hand. 
Remove the shell from the block and repeat the 
performance on the balance. Let your shells 

get well dried. , ■■> t 

The object in placing paste on both sides ot 

the caps is to saturate them so as to work easy 

and pliable, and also to strengthen and stiffen 

when dry. .^ . , ■ u 

After your shells have dried sufficiently, weigh 
in your goods, clean off all flour or other material 
that should adhere to the outside of the shell. 
Lay the pasteboard end on top of the materia 
or filling, then proceed as in making the shell 
with the caos ; after the caps are pasted on, turn 
the package upside down ; the weight of material 
inside will force the end against the cap. W hen 
dry, label as per Instructions for Labeling. 



44 grocers' manual. 

. Labeling Cans. 

Paste your labels with thin paste. Fold each 
one together, pasted sides in. Without you are 
an expert do not paste more than half a dozen. 
When ready to label turn the pile of them over 
so as to use from the bottom, or those first pasted. 
The pasting of half a dozen or more allows them 
to get well moistened before using. When 
placed on the cans or packages in their moist 
state, there will be no wrinkles when they have 
dried. After labeling, stand the packages on top 
of each other to height of three or four packages. 
Do not place them close together, but so that 
air can circulate between them. 

To Label Ink, Blueing, Extract and Gil 

Bottles. 

Paste evenly a board a foot or more square, 
with thin paste. Then take the labels you wish 
to use and lay them backs down on the paste. 
After you have laid out, say a couple dozen, take 
a piece of paper, newspaper will do, and cover 
the whole, then press them down by rubbing 
your hand over the paper. This is the damp- 
ening process for small labels. Commence with 
the first label laid down tt) label the bottle, 
and continue in order ; first pasted, first used* 



grocers' manual, 45 

Directions for Labeling. 
Apply the paste to back of labels, with a wide 
brush. Fold the labels (the pasted surfaces to- 
crether), and let them lie about one minute, 
which will give the proper time to absorb a por- 
tion of the moisture. Then commence with the 
first one pasted, and rub down smooth with a 
stiff brush or handful of cloth. 
' Labels should be kept in a cool, dry place, 
standing on their edges. Never lay them down 

fiat. 

Paste. 

For a good paste that will neither decay nor be- 
come moldy, mix clean flour with cold water into 
a paste well blended, theaadd boiUng water and 
boil, stirring constantly to keep from burning, 
stirring well up until it is of a consistency that 
can be easily and smoothly spread with a brush; 
add to this a spoonful or two of powdered alum, 
to keep it from becoming sour or spoiling. 

Flour Paste. 

The best paste for general purposes is simply 

wheat flour beaten into cold water to perfect 

smoothness, and the whole just brought to a 

boil, while being constantly stirred to prevent 



46 grocers' manual. 

burning. The addition of a few drops of creo- 
sote, or a few grains of corrosive sublimate, or a 
little carbolic acid, or bisulphite of lime (espe- 
cially the first and second), will prevent insects 
from attacking it, and preserve it (in covered 
vessels) for years. Should it get too hard it may 
be softened with water. 

OLIVE OIL, 

The oil generally used for this purpose is a 
refined grade of cottonseed oil (the stearine or 
fat being removed from the crude or fresh oil.) 
It can be bought of any good wdiolesale oil deal- 
ers. It is put up in bottles called pints, holding 
in reality only 10 ozs. ; in half pints, holding 5 
ozs. Put on a foreign sounding label (carried in 
stock by label houses). Pasting an Inch and a 
half of tin foil around the cork and neck com- 
pletes the job. 

This oil is both as pure and strong as the gen- 
uine olive oil, and much cheaper. Olive oil pure 
is almost Impossible to buy at any price. 

DESICCATED COCOANUT. 

''No, sir, we don't make cocoanuts,'' said a 
member of a firm whose sign read, *' Cocoanut 



GROCERS MANUAL. 47 

Manufacturing Company," in response to an in- 
quiry of a reporter for The New York Mail and 
Expi ess, "What we do is to prepare cocoaniit 
for confectioners, bakers and families, to be used 
for pies and pastry. The nuts are brought here 
by the vessel-load, some ships bringing as many 
as 400,000. in one cargo. They are put up in 
bags of one hundred each. The average weight 
of the green nut is one and one-half pounds. 
The best are those thickest in meat and richest 
in natural oil and sugar. They come from San 
Bias, Cow Island, San Andreas, Ruatans, Ja- 
maica, and Baracoa. They grow on the islands 
of the Carribean Sea, and the trees are so planted 
that the roots are constantly washed with salt 
water. The nuts are not picked from the tree, 
but fall to the ground when ripe because of the 
decay of the stems. When the husk is taken 
off they are ready for shipping. The perishable 
nature of the green nut has made desiccated 
cocoanut more desirable in the market, and this 
is the article we manufacture and sell." 

" What is the operation ? '' 

"The cocoanuts are placed in a large hopper, 
from which they fall to a zinc-covered table on a 
lower floor. In front of this table several men 



48 GROCERS MANUAL. 

are placed, who crack the shell of the nut with a 
hatchet as it falls on the table. Then the shell 
is pried ofY, leaving the meat whole. From six to 
eleven o'clock six men at this work open twelve 
thousand nuts. A peeling machine then takes 
off the brown skin of the nuts, after which the 
meats are broken into pieces, the milk drawn off, 
and the pieces put into tubs of clean cold water. 
The meat is then inspected as to its quality, and 
next it is put into a grinding mill turning four 
hundred revolutions a minute. The pulp thus 
made is mixed with granulated sugar and put in 
long pans of galvanized iron, which are put in 
the desiccators and the water extracted at a high 
temperature. An interesting fact about the 
work is that the entire process must be com- 
pleted by two o'clock in the afternoon, because 
of the delicate nature of the fruit. The desiccated 
nut is white as snow, and perfectly dry, when it 
has been through the process, and it is then 
allowed to cool, and is left in a dry temperature 
for ten days before it is finally put up for the 
market. At three o'clock each day the work is 
all done." 

''What about the idea that cocoanut is indi- 
gestible?" 



GROCERS MANUAL. 49 

'Mt is supposed by- many persons to be so. 
But the best growths show by analysis about 48 
per cent, of digestible oils, 5 per cent, of sugar', 
about 46 per cent, of water, and only i per cent. 
of ash. This being the case, there is scarcely 
anything people eat more digestible and nutri- 
tious." 

To Pack Cocoanut. 

Buy a grade that is desiccated in sugar by 
the barrel, known as Baker's A Grade. It is 
as good as is usually packed in cans or packages. 
Pack in cans or paper shells. If in shells line 
them with wax paper. Fruit jars are useful and 
handy packages for this purpose. Some manu- 
facturers call 13 ounces i pound, and 6}i ozs. 
a half pound. 

AQUA AMMONIA. 
Buy FFFF ammonia by the carboy. Put up in 
pint bottles, cork with rubber or rubber covered 
corks. If common cork is used tie a piece of 
bladder over the top of the cork. 

HORSERADISH. 

Grate fine to suit. Mix with vinegar. Bottle 
and cork tight. A little alcohol added will keep 
it from freezing.

CANDY. 

Degrees of Boiling Sugar. 

In preparing sugar for candies the confectioner 
requires different degrees of boiling in order to 
bring the sugar to the proper state for the vari- 
ous articles he prepares. Well clarified and per- 
fectly transparent syrup is boiled until a skimmer 
dipped into it, and a portion touched between 
the forefinger and thumb, on opening them, is 
drawn into a small thread which crystallizes and 
breaks. This is called a weak candy height. 

If boiled again, it will draw into a larger string, 
and if bladders may be blown with the mouth 
through the drippings from the ladle, it has 
acquired the second degree, and is called bloom 
sugar. 

After still further boiling, it arrives at the 
state called feathered sugar. To determine this 
dip the skimmer and shake it over the pan, then 
o^ive it a sudden flirt or jerk, and the sugar will 
fly off like feathers. 

The next degree is that of crackled sugar, in 
which state the sugar that hangs to a stick 



GROCERS MANUAL. 5 1 

dipped into it, and put directly into cold water, is 
not dissolved off, but turns hard and snaps. 

The last stage of boiling reduces it to caramel 
sugar, and is proved by dipping a stick into the 
sugar and then into cold water, when, on the 
moment it touches the water it will snap like 
glass. It has now arrived at a full candy height. 

Throughout the boiling the fire must not be 
too fierce, as it will discolor the syrup. The 
best safeguard against this is the use of steam 
heat. Color may be given to the candy by add- 
ing the coloring matter to the syrup before boil- 
ing it. Flavoring essences must be added when 
the process is nearly complete.

CANNING FRUIT. 

Instructions. 

Select fresh fruit that is perfectly ripe, but at 
the same time, perfectly sound. One unsound 
berry may injure all in contact with it. 

The boiling water poured into the boiler will 
be considerably cooled by contact with the cans ; 
care must be taken not to let the water return to 
the boil while the cans are in it ; and yet it must 
become hot enough to expel the air from the 
cans. 

The surest way to attain the desired object is 
to keep the bulb of a thermometer in the water. 
A heat of 200 to 208 degs. Fahr. will answer 
best, but it must never exceed the latter degree. 
To ascertain when all the air possible has been 
expelled, put one drop of hot water on the air 
hole ; the cessation or absence of air bubbles 
passing through it, will denote that the cans are 
ready for final sealing. 

Fresh Fruit. 

Procure a sufficient number of tin cans of 
suitable size, fill them quite full with the fruit, 
and solder them securely. Next pierce a small 
pin-hole in the top of each can, to allow the air 



OROCER.S I\[AN'UAL. 7 1 

to be expelled ; place the cans in a boiler as 
deep as the cans are high, pour boiling water 
into the boiler until within one-half inch of the 
lop of the cans ; keep the water hot over a mod- 
erate fire, but not boiling, until the air ceases to 
escape from the cans, and then seal the air holes 
with solder before removing the cans from the 
water. The cans should then be taken out, 
wiped dry, and allowed to cool ; when cold, if the 
cans have been closed perfectly air-tight, the 
vacuum inside will cause the top and bottom of 
the cans to become concave or hollowed inward. 
Tomatoes are also kept fresh in this manner. 

Berries, Etc. 

Peaches, apples, pears, plums, etc., can be 
kept perfectly fresh in tin cans in the manner 
described above, and will retain their fresh 
flavor almost, if not entirely intact. Raspberries, 
strawberries, etc., are kept in better condition 
by adding ^ pound white sugar to each pound 
of fruit, letting them come to the boil, and then 
filling the cans quite full, soldering the lid of the 
can immediately. The hot fruit will, to all 
intents, expel the air from the can. No water 
should be used with the fruits, except in case^ 



72 grocers' manual: 

where a little is necessary to dissolve the sugar, 
as it tends to render them insipid. Most vege- 
tables can be kept in cans in this way, omitting 
the sugar, and scalding them in water sufficient 
to cover them. 

Cold Process. 

Pare and halve the peaches. Pack them as 
closely as possible in a can without any sugar. 
When the can is full, pour in sufficient cold water 
to fill all the interstices between the peaches, 
and reach the brim of the can. Let it stand 
long enough for the water to soak into all the 
crevices — say six hours — then pour in water to 
replace what is sunken away. Seal up the can, 
and all is done. Canned in this way, peaches 
retain all their freshness and flavor. There will 
not be enough water in them to render them 
insipid. If preferred, a cold syrup could be 
used instead of pure water, but the peaches taste 
most natural without any sweetening. 

Fresh in Jars. 

Use only self-sealing glass jars. Put into a 
porcelain-lined preserving kettle, enough to fill 
two quart jars ; sprinkle on sugar one-fourth 
pound ; place over a slow fire^ and heat through, 



GROCERS MANUAL. J;:^ 

not boil. While the fruit is being heated, 
keep the jars filled with moderately hot water. 
As soon as the fruit is ready, empty the water 
from the jars, fill to the brim with fruit, and seal 
immediately. As it cools a vacuum is formed, 
which prevents bursting. In this way every 
kind of fruit will retain its flavor. Sometimes a 
thick leathery mold forms on the top — if so, all 
the better. The plan of keeping the jars full of 
hot water is merely to prevent the danger of 
cracking when the hot fruit is inserted. Some 
prefer to set the bottles full of cool water in a 
boiler of water and heating all together grad- 
ually ; but the other way is much simpler and 
equally effective. 

Pears, Etc. 

Place the pears, halved or whole, in the can or 
jar, cold. Pour syrup over them until the can is 
nearly full up to the top. Pure water may be 
used instead of syrup. Solder on the lid care- 
fully, then punch a small hole through the center 
of the lid. Then place the can in a kettle of 
warm water, having some wire in the bottom of 
kettle for the cans to rest on. Have the water 
come up nearly to top of cans. Bring the water 



74 GROCERS MANUAL. 

gently to a boil. Boil twenty minutes, lift out 
the cans, wipe dry around the small hole, then 
solder it up. 

Peaches, plums, cherries, blackberries, green 
gages, apricots, huckleberries, raspberries, are 
canned same as pears. Grapes require heavy 
syrup. 

Time to Boil. 
In canning fruits and vegatables, leave the 
can in water from time it commences boiling, as 
follows : 

Pears 20 minutes 

Peaches 20 

Cherries 20 

Apples 20 

Strawberries 15 

Blackberries 15 

Raspberries 15

Cider Vinegar. 

Take 10 gallons apple juice fresh from the

be in about two weeks, or sooner, if the weather 
is warm ; and then add 8 gallons like juice, new, 
for producing a second fermentation ; in two 
w^eeks more add another like new quantity, for 
producing a third fermentation. This third fer- 
mentation is material. Now stop the bunghole 
with an empty bottle, with the neck downward, 
and expose it to the sun for some time. When 
the vinegar is come, draw off one-half into a 
vinegar cask, and set it in a cool place above 
ground, for use when clear. With the other 
half in the first cask, proceed to make more 
vinegar in the same way. Thus one cask is to 
make in, the other to use from. When making 
the vineo^ar, let there be a moderate deg^ree of 
heat, and free access of external air. The pro- 
cess is hastened by adding to the cider, when 
you have it, a quantity of the mother vinegar, as 
it is called — a whitish, ropy coagulum, of a muci- 
laginous appearance, which is formed in the vine- 
gar, and acts as a ferment. The strength of 
vinegar depends on the amount of -sugar or 
starchy matter to be ultimately converted into 
acetic acid. 

Cheap Vinegar. 

A supply of vinegar can be kept constantly on 



GROCERS MANUAL. 79 

hand by retail grocers. Before you have sold 
out a barrel entirely of your regular stock, say 
two or three gallons, fill it up with i gallon of 
molasses to every 1 1 gallons of soft water. This 
mixture will become o^ood vineo^ar in about three 
weeks — and can be treated in its turn in the 
same way. When less than a barrel a week is 
used, three barrels thus treated and used in ro- 
tation, will be sufficient to keep up a perpetual 
supply. If the barrels stand on end, there must 
be a hole made in the top, protected with gauze 
to keep out insects. If standing on the side, the 
bunghole must be left open, and similarly 
protected. 

SPICES. 

Buy the spices whole and grind them your- 
self. Spice mills are cheap. If you want adul- 
terated spices buy the adulterations separate 
and mix them yourself. All wholesale spice 
houses sell the adulterations already prepared at 
prices moderate enough for any one. 

The writer knows of cases where grocers 
grind their own spices, holding a spice trade 
alone that is very valuable. It is next to im- 
possible to get pure spices in ground state with- 
out grinding them yourself. 



So. grocers' manual. * 

To Clean Spice Mills. 

After grinding one kind of spice, if you wish 
to change to another, grind a small lot of rice 
through the mill. Always grind the weakest 
and most faint flavored spice first. 

CREAM TARTAR 

Is adulterated by mixing phosphate with it in 
proportion to suit selling price.

Hints for Jelly Makers. 

Never use a metal vessel or a metal spoon 
when boiling jelly. 

Boil the jelly in a porcelain lined kettle, or 
in a large stone jar. 

Boil the juice twenty minutes before adding 
sus^ar. 

Dissolve the sugar separately in a little boil- 
ing water, and add it to the boiling juice hot. 

Boil slowly over a steady fire. Do not cover 
while boiling. 

Strain through a flannel bag if possible. If 
not, use a muslin bag. 

Always add sugar of same measure as juice. 
'Boil about four hours.:- : - ' .-. 

If gelatine is used, less boiling is required, 
and less sugar also.
