PREFACE 

In presenting to the public this book on STEAKS, CHOPS AND 
FANCY EGG DISHES we feel that we are presenting the most com- 
plete authoritative and up-to-date book ever prepared on the subject. 
The contributors being the finest chefs in the United States, Canada and 
Europe insure avery recipe shown as right. These world-famous chefs 
have given us their special recipes, and they have made the explanations 
so plain and so complete that any one can readily understand them. 

The great chefs who have prepared these recipes for us have 
all made cooking their life work and have been apprenticed under the 
finest and most practical teachers in the culinary lines in this country 
and abroad. 

A large portion of the copy has been translated from the French. 
The finest chefs are generally the French or Swiss. They are not 
literary men; their language is not flowery, but we know that even with 
the difficulty that exists in expressing in English many of the French 
terms that the work as a whole will be easily understood and greatly 
appreciated. 

This is the first time in history that such a wonderful collection 
of recipes have been made obtainable for general use. These men 
are giving, in these recipes, their "professional secrets." The calibre 
of the men who have prepared these recipes is great and represents as 
much as the great masters in other lines of the world's work. Napoleon 
Bonaparte was a great general; Shakespeare, a great author; George 
Washington, a wonderful statesman; and Thomas Edison, a masterful 
inventor; — but we feel that the master chefs represented here are to be 
considered just as great and doing just as much of the world's work as 
any of the famous men we have all been taught to revere and respect. 

The International Cooking Library, covering in twelve volumes 
every conceivable part, section or angle of the cooking question, makes 
it possible for any one who will follow these recipes to be an expert cook. 
The great masters who have prepared these recipes have spent their 




Their Cher/Our Contributor/! 



lives studying and experimenting and are giving in these recipes their 
best ideas and suggestions. These are dishes of the millionaires and 
the most particular epicureans. 

We feel that this set of books is presented to the public at just 
the opportune time. All people are beginning to realize that there is 
really no more important art than cooking and this should be so; for 
what should be considered more important than what we eat? The 
best health insurance is having the right kind of foods, properly 
prepared. A man is at his best only when he is in robust health and 
nothing will undermine a person's constitution so quickly as poor 
food. The best dishes and the sure and absolute recipes for making 
them, are contained in this wonderful set of books. All the copy 
is from authorities just as positive and just as sure in this line as the 
noted Blackstone was on legal lines. We picked the best chefs in 
the world; we would accept copy from no others. 

A careful study of the recipes and careful application of the 
directions for same is all that is necessary to produce the results 
that have made these men famous. 

In the presentation of this book, we wish only that space would 
allow us to mention and pay courtesy to the many men who have 
assisted us in the various departments, copy preparation, translation, 
and editing, also the courtesies rendered by the managers of the world 
renowned hotels whose chefs have been our contributors.

VICTOR HIRTZLER 

CHEF DE CUISINE 

HOTEL 
ST. FRANCIS 

San Francisco, Cal. 

Mr. Hirtzler was 
born in Strasbourg, 
Alsace, Germany, and 
learned his profession 
under Emile Feypell 
in Strasbourg who is 
considered one of the 
finest Chefs in France. 
Mr. Hirtzler has been 
in the best hotels in 
France and Germany. 
Coming to the United 
States he started in at 
the Old Brunswick in 
New York City, and 
then at the Waldorf 
Astoria, New York City, 
then at Sherry 's famous 
Cafe, New York City. 
He came to San Fran- 
cisco to open the Hotel 
St. Francis in 1904. 



EGGS LEAVEY 

Poach eggs carefully. Place on buttered 
toast, with chicken hash with peppers on one side 
and asparagus tips on the other. Pour hot 
HoUandaise sauce over the egg. 

EGGS A LA HUEGENOTTE 

An omelette in which is folded a minced 
meat made of mutton, mixed with mushrooms, 
flavored with nutmeg and the grated rind of 
an orange. 

EGGS OPERA 

Put the poached egg on a piece of toast of 

the same size. Pour hot cream sauce over all. 

Garnish with hot asparagus tips, sprinkle with 

chopped parsley and place a slice of truffle on top, 

EGGS BAKED WITH POTATOES 
Prepare some potatoes for baking by cutting 
off one end so they will stand upright in the oven. 
When done, scoop out the potato pulp. Put in a 
spoonful of cream sauce. Break into the opening 
a raw egg, covering with a bit of the potato which 
you have mixed with butter. Return to the oven 
for six to eight minutes. Serve wrapped in 
folded napkins. 



EGG CROQUETTES 
Cut eight hard boiled eggs to small bits, 
seasoning with salt, pepper, grated nutmeg and a half cup of grated 
Parmesan cheese. Bind together with a cup of cream sauce. Set away 
to cool. Then shape into croquettes. Dip in flour, then egg mixed with 
a spoonful of cream, then bread crumbs. Fry in hot lard. Serve on a 
platter on a bed of tomato sauce. 



15 





World Famous Chert 



COLD EGGS EUREKA 
Hard boil eggs. Remove yolks and mix with crab salad piled high 
in the shape of an entire egg. Cover with mayonnaise. Sprinkle with 
parsley chopped fine. 

OMELETTE WITH CUCUMBERS 

Slice the cucumbers, dip in flour, then in egg, then in bread crumbs, 
and fry for four or five minutes until a nice brown, having seasoned 
them with salt and pepper. Make omelette. Heat a platter. Cover 
the bottom with hot cream sauce. Put the omelette on this, then lay 
the fried cucumbers about the omelette. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Scramble the eggs, using butter. Make thin toast, trim the edges, 
then place some cooked sweet red pepper on top, then the scrambled 
egg. If desired, a few slices of truffles may be added as a garnishing. 

OMELETTES WITH BANANAS 

Beat three eggs with a whisk until quite light. Add a soupspoonful 
of rich cream and salt. Heat some butter in a pan. Now have some 
bananas cooked slightly in rich syrup, preserving the fruit whole. It 
looks best to cut lengthwise. Before folding over the omelette, place 
the bananas inside. Fold over, bestrew with fine sugar and burn with 
an omelette iron. 

BAKED STEAK EN CASSEROLE 
Take a juicy tenderloin steak, cut about two inches thick. Butter 
an Eastern casserole. Put the steak in this, adding four whole peeled 
tomatoes on top of the steak, two green peppers, a piece of butter the 
size of an egg, two tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one tablespoonful 
of Worcestershire sauce, keeping in hot oven until done, the time 
depending on how the steak is to be served. To have the steak rare 
takes about twenty minutes. By this time the tomatoes will be 
thoroughly heated through and done enough to be very tasty, still 
retaining their shape firmly. If it is desired to have the steak very 
rare, it would be well to cook the peppers a bit in butter before adding 
to the steak, as they should be done enough to be soft.

CHAUTEAUBRIAND STEAK 
The name is given to the round piece of beef in the middle of a 
tenderloin — in other words, the tenderest part of the meat. Flatten 
this tenderloin until it is a little over an inch thick, and broil over 
charcoal. Serve on a hot dish with plenty of melted butter. 

TENDERLOIN VAUDEVILLE STYLE 
Broil small tenderloins. Put on a hot platter, placing a neatly- 
poached egg on one side and a stuffed baked tomato on the other, 
covering all with Madeira sauce. This is a favorite supper dish. 

BAKED PORTERHOUSE 
Have steak thick. Put into Dutch oven with two ounces of butter, 
salt and pepper, and on top of the steak put thres whole peeled 
tomatoes, one green pepper, two tablespoonfuls of Worcestershire 
sauce, same of mushrooms or tomato catsup, a little chopped parsley, 
and keep in the iron pot, basting frequently. 

BROILED ENGLISH LOIN CHOPS 
Broil over charcoal for twelve minutes or less, depending on the 
thickness. They should be slightly rare and full of juice. Cover 
with maitre d'hotel butter when broiled, and season. Maitre d'hotel 
butter is made by beating up a large spoonful of butter with the juice 
of half a lemon and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 

STEAK WITH MARROW 

Parboil the marrow in salt water for ten minutes or longer. Spread 
small bits of toast with the marrow, then spread with mustard liberally, 
then lay small steaks, either fillet or small sirloins on the toast. Heat 
a little butter, squeeze a lemon into it and pour over all.
