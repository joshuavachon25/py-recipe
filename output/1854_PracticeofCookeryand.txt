This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

PREFACE. 



NOTWITHSTANDINQ the many books that have been 
written on Cookery, there still exists a general com- 
plaint, either that the receipts given in them are of 
too expensive a character for general use, or that they 
are only adapted for those who already possess consi- 
derable experience in the art of Cookery, and are of 
but little service to those who are novices in it. 

It is hoped, however, that such objections will not 
apply to this work. 

In preparing the receipts, the author has exercised 
the greatest care and anxiety to give, by means of easy 
and distinct directions, dishes at once economical and 
elegant, and every information which could possibly 
be wanted to render them generally useful has been 
given. The exact quantity of the different ingredients, 
the seasoning and time required for each dish, has been 
specified, and this plan she trusts will prove advan- 
tageous to those who from want of previous experi- 
ence cannot be expected to know these particulars. 

Another edition of the work being required, it has 
been carefully revised and various improvements have 
been introduced. A number of new receipts have been 
added, and no pains have been spared to render this 
axeaJly practical guide to the subject on which it treats, 
and to secure to it a continuance of the patronage 
which it has hitherto enjoyed.

all the meat off the bones ; put the bones into a large 
pot ; fill it half full of water ; put in a little salt ; 
watch well before it boils, and scum it clean : put a 
piece of dripping or butter into your frying-pan, 
brown the meat well on both sides, then add it to your 
soup ; wash out your pan ; add the contents also to your 
soup ; put one whole carrot, one turnip, one head of 
celery, one parsnip, half ounce of black pepper whole, 
half ounce of Jamaica pepper, one pound of red onions 
whole, with their skins, and sweet marjoram : let it 
boil slowly for six hours, taking care not to let it off 
the boil ; if it is too much reduced by boiling, add a 
little boiKng water to it, then strain it through a sieve ; 
put back your meat again into your pot, and cover 
it with boiling water ; put it on and boil it an hour ; 
strain it separately from the soup. The day you are 
to use the soup, dip a spopn into boiling water, skim 
it well, taking care to keep back the sediment. If

onions, a bit of sweet maijoram, a blade of mace, 
some white pepper, whole ; boil it slowly for four 
hours, strain it through a sieve, take off the white 
pieces from the breast of the fowl, and any other 
parts of the meat, put a little cold water over it, put 
back the bones and all the ingredients into the stew- 
pan, cover it with boiling water, let it boil for some 
time ; it will make a little more stock, take the bits 
of your fowl and meat, pound them together, put a 
little stock to them, and press them through the sieve ; 
the stock will make it. go through easier. Your 
stock being ready, skim it well, put it in a clean 
stew-pan, keep back the sediment, take a tea-cupful 
of rice flower, wet it with a little cold water, pour in 
a little of the boiling stock, mix it till very smooth, 
stir till it boils, season to taste, and dish it hot. 

There is another way of thickening this soup ; —

bstead of the pounded fowl, beat up the yolks of four 
^gs, add a breakfast-cupful of good cream, mix them 
together ; when you are to dish it, take a ladleful of 
boiling soup, pour it into the tureen amongst the eggs 
and cream, stirring all the time, then pour the re- 
mainder of your soup, stir it a little : this should be 
done when you are to send it to table. 

OTSTEB SOUP. 

Have a Scotch pint of stock, as for white soup, put 
it in a stew-pan, take a tea-cupful of rice flour, mix 
it with a little cold water, put it into your stock, stir 
it till it boils ; let it boil for five minutes, take care 
it does not boil over ; take one hundred and a half of 
oysters, put them on the fire in their own liquor, 
shake them occasionally till they just boil up ; do not 
allow them to boil one minute, as they shrink up 
aiid become tasteless ; put them through a sieve, over 
a basin to preserve the liquor ; when it clears, pour 
it into the sauce, keep back the sediment, put in four 
blades of mace, some whole white pepper, let it boil 
slowly for half an hour with a close cover, then strain 
it, add this to the stock ; beard the oysters, pick all 
the bits of shells that may be about them ; just be- 
fore dinner put the oysters into the soup, add a tea-

tureen ; have the soup and chickens boiling, pour it 
in gently amongst the eggs and cream, stirring all 
the time, add your chickens ; this should be done 
very quickly, that the soup may not get cold : if you 
put it pn the fire after the eggs are put to it, the eggs 
will break. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP.

cut them in small bits one inch square, add them to 
your soup, take the breast of the fowl and pound with 
a little lean ham; season with white pepper, a little

egg balls (See Egg Balls), have some girkins, cut 
them in small bits and add them to the soup, add 
one hundred of oysters, put them on the fire in their 
own liquor, let them just come to the boil, put them 
through the sieve ; take off their beards : Just be- 
fore you dish the soup, add them to it, do not let the 
soup boil after you have put in the oysters, other- 
wise it will spoil them : salt to taste, put a tea cup- 
.ful of Madeira wine into the tureen, make the soup 
very hot, serve it up.

and bone them ; cut the best parts of the partridges 
in small pieces, put them aside ; put the giblets and 
bones in a stew-pan, add three pounds of hough cut 
in small bits, cover them with water and a little salt ; 
skim when it comes to boil, add a parsnip, some ! 
sweet herbs, six onions, let it all boil to rags ; strain it 
through a sieve, pick out the liver and any of the flesh 
of the partridges amongst the straining of the soup, 
pound them in a mortar, put a little of the soup to 
it, and press it through the sieve ; skim your soup 
clean, put it into a stew-pan, adding the pieces of the 
partridges, and what you rubbed through the sieve, 
let it boil slowly till the partridges are tender ; if you 
wish it brown, put in a little browning (See Brown- 
ing), a little ketchup, pepper and salt to taste. When 
wanted, put a little port wine into the tureen, send 
it up hot. 

MULLIGATAWNY SOUP. 

Take a knuckle of veal or any scraps, put them on 
to boil with a gallon of water, boil three hours, strain 
it the day you require the soup, skim your stock, put 
it in a stew-pan ; have a young fowl, or two small 
chickens, singe and draw them, cut off the legs and 



r 



SOUPS. 



wings, joint the legs in two, take off the merry 
thought. Jay the fowl upon one side, divide the car- 
case in two, divide the back in four, and the breast 
in two, put a bit of butter in the frying-pan, add one 
dozen of onions minced, and fry to a nice light brown ; 
add as much stock as the frying-pan will contain ; 
take two baking apples, peel them, divide them into 
four, and take out the core ; put them in the frying- 
pan, then take two table spoonfuls of curry powder^ 
two table spoonfuls of flour, mix the flour aiid curry 
together in cold water, and add a little of stock ; put 
all in the fiying-pan, stir, and let it boil for ten 
minutes ; then rub it through a sieve with the back 
of a spoon, add a little of the soup to it, till it is all 
run through your sieve ; clean your frying-pan, put 
it on with a bit of butter ; when the butter froths 
up, put in the fowl or chickens, brown them to a nice 
light brown on both sides, add them to the soup, let 
it simmer for half an hour, add the curry you rubbed 
through the sieve to the soup, boil all slowly together 
till your fowl is tender ; add salt to taste. If you 
find it not hot enough, add a little cayenne; the soup 
should be of the consistency of good cream. If you 
think it is not thick enough, put in a little of the 
flour of rice. Before you dish it, put in a cupful of 
good cream in the soup, stir it round, and dish it hot ; 
serve it with boiled rice. 

HARE SOUP. 

Take a large hare, skin it, cut it up, be careful 
not to break the inside, put in your hand and take 
out the lungs, hold the hare over a basin to catch the 
blood, put the lungs into the basin with the blood, 
holding the hare over it till it has stopt bleeding ; 
lay it upon a table, cut off the four legs of the hare, 
cut off the ribs and belly part ; with a sharp knife, 
cut down your hare close by the back bone, cut the 



10 SOUPS. 

flesh from bofch sides of the bone, lay the meat aside, 

Eut your bones in the basin, then cut all the flesh 
*om the legs, take ofl^ the head, lay it beside your 
flesh ; add a gallon of water to the blood and bones, 
and wash them ; take a large stew-pan, put a sieve 
upon the top of it, and pour in the blood and water. 
If any of the blood remains in the sieve, press it 
through with your hand. Stir in one quarter a 
pound of the flour of rice in the stew-pan amongst 
the blood, put it on the fire and stir it till it boils ; 
then add a little boiling water, or stock if you have 
it ; put in the bones and ribs of the hare, and stir it ; 
when it boils, add one carrot, one turnip, one parsnip, 
a bit of celery, a few onions, a little whole black 
pepper, some sweet herbs, and two pounds of hough ; 
let all boil together for three hours, take it off, put 
the sieve on the top of a large basin, and strain all 
the soup, picking out all the small bones out of your 
sieve. With a wooden spoon press all the blood 
through the sieve, and put a little boiling water in 
the sieve, which will make it go through easier. 
This is the best thickening for hare soup ; put the 
soup in a stew-pan, take the flesh of the hare which 
you laid aside, and cut it in small pieces ; brown a 
piece of butter in the frying-pan ; brown the flesh 
of your hare on both sides, and, with a few onions 
minced small, put it in the stew-pan amongst the 
soup. Put all to boil slowly. If a young hare, one 
hour will make it tender, but if an old one, it will 
require two hours. Before dishing, season with salt 
and pepper to taste, add a little cayenne, a little 
ketchup ; dish all in your tureen. 

CARROT SOUP. 

Take the bones of cold roast beef or mutton, and 
break them ; put them in a stew-pan and cover them 
with boiling water and a little salt ; grate one dozen 



r 



m 



soupa n 

of large carrots, put them in with the bones along 
with some onions ; boil them for four hours, then 
take out the bones and put the soup through the 
sieve with a wooden spoon, rub the whole of the 
carrot through, skim the soup and put it back into 
your stew-pan. The soup should be as thick as cream. 
Add a little cayenne and salt to taste. Dish it hot. 

TUBNIP SOUP. 

Take one dozen of white turnips, one dozen of 
white onions, and proceed as above. When pressed 
through your sieve, add salt, white pepper, and one 
tearcupful of cream to make it white. Dish it hot. 

LAMB STOVE. 

Take a lamb's head and pluck, and put them into 
salt and water. Have one Scotch pint of white 
stock, made out of a knuckle of veal or scraps of any 
kind ; add four ounces of rice flour. When it boils, 
put in your lamb's head, and let it boil for one hour, 
and add a few small onions minced nicely. Have 
half a gallon of very green spinage, picked, washed, 
and drained ; put it in the soup, with salt and white 
pepper to taste^; beat up the yolk of an egg, add a 
cupful of cream, and put it into the tureen. When 
the spinage is tender, the head is done. When 
wanted, pour it into the tureen, stirring it all the 
time. Dish the head and pluck into the tureen. 

SPLIT PEASE SOUP. 

Take one pound of split pease, two pounds of hough 
or roasted beef bones, and put them in a stew-pan 
with boiling water, a little salt, twa or three onions, 
one small turnip, one carrot, and a bit of celery. 
Let it boil slowly for two hours, take out the bones 
and press it through a sieve, put it back into the 
stew-pan ; add a little white pepper and salt to taste. 



\ 



K 



12 SOUPS. 

Have some toasted bread cut in diamonds put it in 
the tureen, and pour the boiling soup on it. You may 
improve this soup by having some spinage leaves 
boiled a fine green, and strained, then add them to 
the soup. 

LEEK SOUP. 

Take two pounds of a hough or roast-beef bones, 
put them in a stew-pan with a good deal of water, 
and a little salt ; boil it for two hours, then take the 
piece of beef and bones out, and have an old fowl 
cleaned and trussed as for boiling (I prefer jointing 
it as for curry), and put it in the soup. Have two 
dozen of large leeks, cut off all the green parts from 
them, cut the white ends in pieces, one inch in length, 
wash them in water till very clean, add them to the 
soup and let them boil until the fowl is tender. By 
that time the leeks will be done, then salt to taste, 
and dish your soup and fowl in the tureen. Send it 
hot to table. 

SKATE SOUP. 

Take a half skate, clean, and let it hang for one 
day ; then skin it, and cut the best parts in small 
pieces, about an inch square ; put the head, skin, and 
trimmings into a pan, with two onions, parsley, and 
water to cover it ; let it boil until all the substance 
be extracted, then strain it, and take three ounces of 
butter, brown it in a saucepan with flour, pour in 
the stock, stir until it boil, then add the small pieces 
of skate ; let all boil for half an hour, add two table- 
spoonfiils of ketchup, one glass of sherry wine, and 
salt to taste. 

RICE BROTH. 

Take a knuckle of veal, put it in a stew-pan, and 
pour boiling water so as to cover it ; put one carrot, 






SOUPS. 13 

one turnip, a little salt and whole white pepper, and 
let it boil for two hours, then take out the veal and 
strain the soup, and put back the veal and soup into 
the stew-pan ; add a tea-cupful of whole rice, and 
boil it till tender; mince some parsley and two 
onions, and put them in the soup ; let it boil fifteen 
minutes. Before you dish, have two yolks of eggs 
beat up, with one tea-cupful of cream, and put the 
eggs and cream in your tureen, then pour in the 
boiling soup, stirring all the time. 

sheep's-head broth. 

Have a sheep's-head and feet singed, split it up, 
take out the brains and rub the head and feet with 
them ; let it lie all night, and in the morning put it 
on the fire, in a pot with cold water. Let it get hot, 
but not to boil ; take it from the fire and let it stand 
one hour, then wash it well, brush it with a brush 
until you are to put them to boiL Have a pot ready, 
put in one tea-cupful of barley, two ounces of whole 
rice, two pounds of the neck of mutton ; put in the 
head and feet, and plenty of cold water and a little 
salt. Skim it well, and when it comes to boil, draw 
it to the side of the fire, and let it boil slowly but 
constantly for two hours ; then add carrots, turnips, 
onions, cut neatly, and let it boil for other two hours, 
salting to taste. If your head is tender, take the 
broth off^ the fire, dish the head with the feet round 
it, and pour a little melted butter and minced parsley. 

HODGE PODGR 

Take six or eight pounds of the back ribs of mut- 
ton ; cut off six chops from the best end ; trim off 
the fat and put them aside ; take a piece of mutton, 
put it in a stew-pan, put plenty of water into it and 
a little salt ; skim it clean when it comes to boil ; 
cut two heads of cauliflower very small, wash it well, 



14 FISH. 

and put it in tbe pot, adding one English pint of 
carrots, one of turnips, cut small, two English pints 
of pease, and boil them all together for two hours. 
Take out the piece of mutton and put in the chops, 
another pint of very green pease, the white part of 
one dozen of young onions, and salt to taste. If you 
find the hodge podge not thick enough, add a few 
more vegetables, and let them all boil one hour. 
This soup should never be ready long before it is to 
be dished, as by standing it loses the green colour. 
Serve it hot with the chops in the tureen. 

BROWNING FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES. 

Take a pound of raw sugar, put it in a sauce-pas, 
pour in a tea-cupful of water and put it on the fire 
until the sugar is melted ; let it boil slowly for fifteen 
minutes, add a little more water to it, and let it boil 
until you have reduced it to one English pint ; run it 
through a piece of book^muslin, and when it is cold 
bottle it up. This is very good browning for soup, 
but I prefer Lazenby's browning sauce. 



FISH. 

DRESSEp COD. 

Have a good large cod, cut off the head, with a 
small piece of the shoulder ; lay your fish in a good 
deal of salt for a night or so, cut off the fins, skin the 
body of the fish, out off the tail, a piece of about six 
inches ; take the bones out of the large piece, and put 
the small piece in the inside of it ; roll them up neatly 
and cord it with a piece of twine. Have a pan <rf 
bcnling water, plenty of salt, with a little vinegar ; 



nsH. 15 

put in the fish, and when it boils take off the cover 
a little to the side ; let it boil for twenty-five minutes, 
take it off the fire, but do not let it lie in the water. 
After it is boiled, draw up the drainer and place it 
across the fish pan, and cover it with a dry clean 
cloth. Before dishing, cut off the cord, lay it on a 
napkin, and garnish with fried roes or whitings, and 
parsley, plain butter, oysters, or anchovies. You can 
bake this piece of cod by keeping out the small piece, 
and putting in stuffing. (See Fish Stuffing,) 

TO DBESS cod's HEAD AND SHOULDERS. 

Take a good cod, cut the head and shoulders the 
size you want, put the fish upon a board, pour boil- 
ing Water upon it, then scrape it gently with a knife 
to take the black off, but do not take off the «kin. 
When the fish becomes white, lay it in cold water 
until it gets firm, and lay it in salt for some time be- 
fore you boil it. When you are to dress it, have a 
pan with plenty of boiling water and salt, and a little 
vinegar ; put in the fish and boil it for half iin hour, 
but do not boil it with the cover close, as it spoils 
the fish and makes it soft. Skin the tail-piece and 
cut it into small pieces, roll them and tie them with 
a piece of twine, brush them over with a beat egg, 
and strew bread-crumbs over them. Have your fry- 
ing-pan with plenty of lard very hot, put in the fillets 
and fry them for ten minutes, turn them upon the 
other side ; they will require other ten minutes before 
they are done ; then lay them upon a sieve before the 
fire to drain. Dish the head and shoulders upon a 
napkin, lay the fried fillets round them, and garnish 
with parsley. Send oyster sauce in a tureen. 

You can make a very savoury disk of cod's-head 
and Moulders, by stuffing and baking it. {See Fish

16 FISH. 

DRESSED FISH WITH PASTE BORDER 

For a large dish, have seven ordinary-sized had- 
docks ; clean, and let them lie amongst a little salt 
for about twelve hours, then skin and split up the 
back, on each side of the bone, in order to divide 
them in two ; after which, turn neatly, and roll them 
up, then place six of the haddocks in a baking dish 
that will just hold them ; cover closely with another 
dish of the same size, and put in the oven, bake for 
three quarters of an hour, then take the remaining 
fish and mince down with two ounces of marrow, a 
little grated bread, cayenne pepper, and moisten with 
an egg. It may be improved by a little parsley, and 
a small onion minced, roll out a quarter of an inch 
thick, cut into a round shape about the size of an 
egg-cup, fry them to a light brown, then have a 
quarter of a hundred of oysters, scalded and bearded, 
have about an English pint of stock deduced from 
skins, bones, and heads of the haddocks ; knead three 
ounces of butter among two table-spoonfuls of flour, 
put it in half a tea-cupful of cream, and add to the 
stock ; shake over the fire until it boil, then add the 
oysters. Save a baked paste border round the dish 
on which they are to go to the table ; pour in the 
sauce first, then place the rolls neatly above, sprink- 
ling cayenne, or pounded lobster roe, on the top of 
each roll ; place the fish cakes between them, and 
small sprigs of parsley alternately. Endeavour to 
send up to table as hot as possible. 

TO CLEAN AND PREPARE HADDOCKS. 

Have some haddocks, take out the inside, cut them 
open considerably below the vent ; wash them well, 
but do not scrape the skins ; cut ofi^ the point of the 
tail, take out the eyes and ^s, put in some salt into 
the bodies, let them lie until next day, then put them 



r 



FISH. 17 



upon a fish heck or a wooden rod put through the 
eyes; hang them in a cool place in the air ; they may 
be boiled or broiled, taking off the heads and skins. 

BOILED HADDOCKS WITH OYSTERS. 

Have two or three good haddocks, of the middle 
size, prepared as the above ; cut them into fillets just 
at dinner time ; put them in a fish pan, with as much 
boiling water as will cover them, a handful of salt, 
and let them boil five minutes with the cover off. A 
little before you boil the haddocks, have a sauce made, 
take an English pint of white stock, put in the heads, 
skins, and fins of the haddocks, boil them for twenty 
minutes, then strain it ; melt two ounces of butter 
with a table-spoonful of flour, a tea-cupful of cream, 
stir until very smooth, add this to the stock ; put it 
upon the fire, and stir until it boils ; it should be very 
thick. Add one quarter hundred of oysters to it, but 
do not let the sauce boil after you have put in the 
oysters, or you will spoil it. Have the dish you are 
to serve the fish upon very hot, lay the haddocks in 
a ring and pour the sauce in the centre, garnishing 
with parsley round the edge of your dish. 

ANOTHER WAT TO BOIL HADDOCKS. 

Clean and skin them, put their tails through their 
eyes, boil and dish them upon a napkin, garnishing 
with parslej, fried roes, or spirlings, and send up 
with shrimp sauce. {See Shrimp Sauce.) 

TO DRESS HADDOCKS WITH BROWN SAUCE. 

Take two or three large haddocks, cut off their 
heads, skin and bone them into neat fillets, put on 
heads, bones, and fins, two onions sliced, add whole 
black pepper, a little cayenne, and cover them with 
boihng water ; let them boil twenty minutes, then 
strain them, and brush over your fillets with eggs. 

B 



18 FISH. 

Take a large stew-pan, brown four ounces of butter, 
shake in flour, make a fine light brown, turn them 
over, when the other side is browned, add the stock 
you strained, put in a table-spoonful of ketchup, one 
of browning sauce, and one of Chili vinegar; let 
them boil fifteen minutes without the cover, add salt 
to taste, dish them round the dish, pour the sauce 
in the middle, send up very hot, garnished with 
parsley. 

DKESSED FISH WITH BAIiLS. 

Take two or three large haddocks, skin and cut 
each in four, put on the skins, heads, and tails in a 
stew-pan, and cover with boiling water ; let them 
boil for half an hour, then strain them. Take one 
of the fillets, and take the fish clean off the bone, 
and mince small, with an ounce of suet, a small 
onion, a little parsley, a sprig of marjoram, and six 
oysters ; add a few bread crumbs, season with cayenne 
and salt, moisten with the yolk of an eggy roll into 
eight or nine balls, and brown them in the frying- 
pan. Take four ounces of butter, and brown it with 
flour in a stew-pan ; then brown the fillets of fish on 
both sides, and pour in as much of the stock as will 
nearly cover them. Then add the balls, one table- 
spoonful of ketchup, one of vinegar, one of India 
soy, and let all boil briskly for fifteen minutes. 
Dish the fish neatly round the dish, and the sauce 
and balls in the centre. Garnish with parsley. 

TO BOIL TUEBOT. 

Have a good turbot, lay it in salt and water for a 
little, scrape and wash it well, make a deep cross 
cut upon the back of it, — that prevents the skin 
from breaking on the breast. Have a large fish 
kettle of ijoiling water ready, with a good deal of 
sidt and a little vinegar ; lay in your fish upon the 



FISH. 19 

back, boil it slowly for twenty-five minutes, with 
the cover off. If the fish is very large, it will re- 
quire half an hour ; when done, draw up your drainer, 
place it across the pan, cover it up with a dry cloth 
to keep the steam in, dish it upon a napkin, and 
garnish with parsley ; serve with lobster sauce in a 
tureen. 

TO FRY HADDOCKS. 

Take some small haddocks, skin and trim them 
neatly, and put their tails through their eyes. Have 
plenty of lard in a stew-pan, and let it be very hot. 
The way to know that your lard is hot enough, dip 
your finger in cold water and let it drop into the 
stew-pan ; if it is hot enough it will make a great 
noise. Brush your fish over with beat-up eggs, and 
strew them over with bread crumbs, put them into 
the lard, fry them a light brown, and when done lay 
them on a sieve before the fire to drain. Whitings 
are prepared the same way. Send beat butter with 
them. 

TO BROIL MACKEREL.

all the substance extracted ; then strain it* Take a 
stew-pan, put in about four ounces of butter, brown 
it, shake in some flour, shake the pan to keep it from 
burning, till you have made it a fine light brown.

egg, lay them in the stew-pan, brown it well, turn it 
over on the other side, brown it, pour in the stock 
which you strained, take care not to have much 
stock, shake the pan well to prevent the flour from 
falling to the bottom ; add a little hot vinegar and

TO STEW A RUMP OF BEEF. 

Let your beef hang for some days to make it ten- 
der, bone it, and lard it thickly with bits of bacon 
ham. Take a sauce-pan that will hold your beef, 
put some slices of pork in the bottom of your stew- 
pan, have your beef rubbed over with fresh drip- 
pings, brown it before the fire for an hour, lay it in 
your stew-pan, and put it on a slow fire, adding two 
quarts of good stock, some whole black pepper, six 
small onions whole, three bay-leaves, and a few sweet 
herbs. Let it simmer at the side of your fire for 






BKEF. -SI 

three or four hours ; one hour before dinner take out 
your beef and put it in your oven, or before the fire, 
to keep it hot ; glaze your beef, have the gravy in 
which you stewed your beef reduced to a quart, 
strain it, and skim the fat clean oflF ; take a small 
stew-pan, brown a bit of butter, shake in flour, and 
make it a nice light brown ; pour in your stock, let

part of a brisket of beef, cut out all the bones, sprinkle 
a little pepper, roll it up neatly, and bind it with a 
piece of cord, put it before the fire one hour, to 
brown it. Take a stew-pan large enough to hold it, 
put in half a gallon of water, then lay in your beef, 
add one head of celery, four onions, a handful of 
parsley, one half ounce of black pepper, cayenne, and 
salt. Let it stew slowly for three or four hours, have 
some carrots and turnips cut out, and boil them in a 
little stock with a little salt^ The carrots will re- 
quire double the time the turnips take, therefore you 
will require to put in your carrots one hour before 
you add the turnips. Take out your beef, glaze it, 
strain your stock, and skim off the fat. Then brown 
a bit of butter in a small stew-pan, shake in a good 
deal of flour, |i,dd an English pint of your stock, and 
a little of the water in which you boiled your vege- 
tables. Stir it till it boils, drain your vegetables, put 
them into your sauce-pan, adding a table-spoonful of 
hot vinegar, one of brown sauce, and salt to taste.

TO DRESS A ROUND OF BEEF. 

Have a round of ox beef, from sixteen to twenty 
pounds, nicely cut ; cut out the bone, rub it over 
with common salt, let it lie two or three days upon a 
flat large dish ; have a pickle prepared of the follow- 
ing » three pounds of bay salt, one ounce of saltpetre, 
one ounce of salt prunella, and pound them, one 
pound of coarse sugar, and two gallons of water ; put 
it upon the fire, stir it occasionally to prevent the 
ingredients falling to the bottom ; skim it well when 
it comes aboil, let it boil twenty minutes, take it off 
and let it stand till cold ; then put your beef into a 
small pickling tub or jar, pour you pickle over it, 
keeping back the grounds, lay a clean heavy stone 
upon it, put on a close cover, and turn it every other 
day. Your meat will be excellent in fourteen days, 
it will not be over salt, although you should keep it 
for six weeks. A little cochineal improves the colour 
yrhen it is in the pickle. When you are to use it, 
bind it tightly with a cord ; put it into a large stew- 
pan with plenty of cold water, put it on the fire till 
it comes to boil, skim so long as the scum rises, draw 
it to the side of the fire, and let it simmer slowly for 
four hours ; it will be improved by standing in the 
water a while, before it is wanted have some vege- 
table greens and carrots boiled. Before dishing your 
beef, make it hot, and take off the cord it was bound 
with ; put in a silver or iron skewer, garnish with 
some vegetable flowers, your greens an4 carrots alter- 
nately round the beef, pour a little of the water in 
which the beef was boiled over it. 

TO CORN A BRISKET OF BEEF. 

Have from fourteen to fifteen pounds of the brisket 
of beef; rub it over with common salt, and let it lie 
for three days ; put .it in the above pickle with a heavy 



r 



BEEF. 33 

weight upon it, and turn it every day ; it will be for 
use in ten days. When you are to boil it, do not 
soak it in water ; put it in a stew-pan and cover it 
with cold water ; when it boils, draw it to the side 
of the fire, and let it boil slowly until the ribs draw 
out Have some carrots and greens boiled separately 
to garnish with ; or if you wish it cold, when it is 
done, take it out of the water, take out all the bones, 
roll it in a clean cloth, and put a heavy weight upon 
it all night if wanted ; for breakfast, trim it neatly, 
and garnish with green parsley. 

TO STEW A BBISKErr OF BEEF. 

Take from twelve to fourteen pounds of the nine- 
holes of beef, bone neatly before rolling up and cord- 
ing, sprinkle some pepper and salt on the inside, put 
it on a very slow fire in a stew-pan that will hold it 
easily, turning it occasionally till it is all a nice light 
brown, then cover up and let it simmer slowly for 
two or three hours ; add one quart of good stock, and 
let it simmer two hours longer. Take a small stew-pan 
and brown two ounces of butter and a little flour ; 
jnst before dinner take out the beef on a dish, taking 
care to keep it hot ; pour the gravy out of the large 
stew-pan into the small one, put it on the fire, stir 
till it boils, then skim the fat clean ofl^, and add one 
table-spoonful of ketchup, one of India soy, one of 
Chili vinegar, and one dozen of minced truffles.

shred lettuce or parsley. 

TO ROAST A SIRLOIN OF BEEF. 

To sixteen pounds of beef allow three hours 
roast. Have a good clear fire ; put your roast before 
your fire, about ten inches distant from it. If you 
have not a spit, turn the bone side to the fire first, 
and gradually draw it near the fire. Have a piece of 
paper put round your roast, and fix it with a wooden 
skewer. Baste it with a little rich drippings at first, 
and keep basting it with fat all the time you are 
roasting it. The flavour and richness of roast meat 
depends greatly upon basting it while roasting. Fif- 
teen minutes before you dish it, sprinkle a little salt, 
and dredge it with flour. Put it close to the fire till 
it froths up, then dish it, and have a little of the 
gravy, with water and salt ; pour it over your beef> 
and garnish it with grated horse-raddish. 

TO DRESS BEEF-STEAKS.

fine, sprinkle them over your steaks, roll and tie them 
up with a piece of thread. Take a stew-pan with 
piece of butter, brown it with a little flour, put in 
your steaks, brown them a nice light brown, and add 
a little boiling water or stock. Put your cover on 
close, let them stew for one hour slowly. Before 
serving cut off the threads, add a table-spoonful of 
ketchup, dish them neatly, and pour the sauce over 
them.

them so as to stand upon their ends. When you are ' 
to dish them, take a stew-pan that will just hold them 
all, brown a piece of butter with flour, brown your 
olives well ; add a little boiling stock and a few small 
onions whole. Put on your cover close, stew them 
slowly for an hour, add a little cayenne and ketchup,

pings. Serve them up with toasted bread or brown 

gravy. 

BEEF TEA. 

Take one pound of the juicy side of the round, cut 
it into very small bits, and keep back the skin ; put 
it on in a clean stew-pan with a quart of cold water 
and a little salt Before it boils, skim it clean, and 
let it boil slowly for forty minutes. 

BEEF TEA ANOTHER WAY. 

Take the same quantity of beef, or more if re- 
quired, skin and^cut it in very small bits, put it into 
a jelly-jar that will hold it easily, sprinkle a little 
salt over it, and tie a piece of cloth over the jar ; put 
it into a close stew-pan among cold water about four 
inches deep, and let simmer for six hours, adding a 
little boiling water occasionally, taking care not to 
allow it to boil into the jar. This beef-tea is very 
beneficial for a weak consumptive person. 

TO CURE BEEF FOR A HAM. 

Have your ham cut as much in the form of a sugar 
loaf as you can, without the bone, when it is quite 
fresh. Bub it with common salt, and let it lie three 
days. Prepare a pickle of the following : four gal- 
lons of water, six pounds of bay salt, two ounces of 
saltpetre; pound the salt and saltpetre together; two 
pounds of raw sugar, put it on the fire and scum it 
well, and stir from the bottom. Let it boil for an 
hour; take it ofi" and let it stand till cold. Wipe your 
beef with a dry cloth and put it into your pickling 
tub. Pour your pickle over it and put a weight upon 
your beef in order that it may be entirely covered 
with the pickle. Turn it every two days, and let it 
lie in the pickle for four weeks. Take it out and 



38 BEEF. 

cord it up very tight. If you wish to have it smoked 
hang it up in an out-house, or open vent, with a fire 
made of hardwood-tree leaves and sawdust. When 
itlias hung for two weeks, wrap it up into paper, and 
hang it in a dry cold place. This pickling answers 
for pickling pork, ham, and tongues. Tongues should 
be rubbed with salt and saltpetre, six days before 
they are put into the pickle. You may preserve this 
pickle as long as you please, by boiling it up every 
six weeks, and adding a little sugar and common salt 
to it. 

TO SALT BEEF FOR IMMEDIATE USE. 

Take whatever piece of beef you want, and rub 
with common salt, for half an hour, as much as you 
can rub into it. Take a washing-tub, fill it half full 
of cold water, and lay two small sticks across it. Lay 
your beef upon them, and in one night or two it will 
be fit for use. 

TO STEW A TONGUE. 

Get a good fresh tongue, rub it well with commqn 
salt and saltpetre, and let it lie four days. Wash it 
well, put it on the fire, with as much cold water as 
will cover it ; let it boil slowly for two hours, then 
take it out, skim and trim it neatly. Put it into a 
stew-pan with a piece of butter and flour, brown it a 
little, and put in an English pint of the liquor in 
which it was boiled. When it boils, put in the tongue 
into the stew-pan, two whole onions, two slices of 
turnip, and a small piece of celery, and let it simmer 
at the side of the fire. When wanted, take out the 
tongue, glaze it, keep it hot, pick your vegetables out 
of your sauce, add a spoonful of mushroom ketchup, 
one of lemon pickle, pepper and salt to taste. Dish 
your tongue, and you can either send it up plain, or 
garnished with spinage.

with the kidneys, dust them well with flour. Put 
a piece of butter in your stew-pan and brown it a 
little ; put in the kidneys and skirts, with an onion 
finely minced, and an English pint of good stock or 
gravy. Simmer them an hour at the side of your 
^ fire, then season with salt and pepper, and a spoonful 
of ketchup. Send it up hot. 

TO MAKE GLAZE. 

If you have the liquor in which hams or tongues 
have been boiled, take a whole hough of beef, and an 
ox-foot or any scraps of veal, and put them into a 
large pot and boil slowly for ten or twelve hours. 
When it comes to the boil, skim it well,. then strain 
it. Put back your bones and meat, cover them with 
boiling water, let them boil slowly for two hours, 
strain them ; when all your stock is cold, skim them 
very clear. Put it into a sauce-pan, set it upon the 
fire and let it boil slowly, without a cover, till it be 
reduced to a small quantity. You must attend to it 
in case it should boil over or bum. When it is done 
enough, dip a spoon in it, touch it with your thumb 
and finger, and if it cause them to stick together it 
is ready. Put it into jelly-pots. When you are to 
use it, set your jelly-pot in amongst warm water. 
When it becomes a liquor, have a brush :. glazes hams, 
tongues, fowls, stewed beef, cutlets, sweet-breads, &c.

lard and make a paste with three pounds of barley- 
meal or coarse flour, and one pound of dripping, in 
which roll the ham, put it in a quick oven, and bake 
for three hours, then take off the paste, and either 
glaze or brown it. 

TO MAKT! A SHAPE OF VEAL. 

Take two pounds of the fillet, stew it in a little 
stock for one hour, along with one pound of lean 
ham, then take both out ; when cold, trim and cut 
into thin slices about an inch and a half long, boil 
three eggs hard and cut them through the centre, 
and the white parts into rings, to fill which, have 
beetroot boiled and cut in slices to the size. Have 
mixed pickles, such as onions, girkins, &c., and pars- 
ley. Take a large tin mould and place the white 
rings with the beetroot, yolks, and pickles, tastefully 
in the bottom, then put veal, ham, pickles, and eggs, 
alternately until the mould is filled. Have the stock 
in which the veal was stewed seasoned and reduced 
to fill the mould. When cold, turn out, and servp 
for breakfast, luncheon, or supper. 

FRICAm)EAU OF VEAL. 

Cut a piece from the fillet of veal, the quantity 
you want, and lard the top and sides of it. Take a 
stew-pan that will hold it, put some slices of bacoa 
into the bottom, one English pint of good white stock, 
two onions, two blades of mace, one carrot, one tur- 
nip, and some parsley,' and one half of a lemon. Put

in the veal, cover it closely, let it stew gently for three 
hours, then take out the veal and keep it hot. Strain 
your sauce, skim off the fat, put it into a small stew- 
pan, season with white pepper and salt, and reduce it 
to very little, and add a glass of sherry wine. Have 
your fricandeau well glazed, and dish it upon stewed 
pease. 

VEAL CAKE. 

Take a pound of cold roast veal, a slice of lean pork- 
ham, and mince and pound them well together, with 
one onion, and a tea-cupful of bread crumbs, soaked 
in a little milk. Beat up two eggs, mix them all to- 
gether, season with white pepper and salt. Butter 
your mould and fill it ; bake it one hour in a quick

them ; boil them for half an hour, then take them 
out; ar^d trim them when cold, and slice them. Beat 
"^6 6gb, season with white pepper and nutmeg, draw 
them through the egg, and roll them in bread crumbs. 
Pry them a nice light brown, put them before the fire 
to drain, keep them hot, have a dish of spinage, boiled 
or whole rice, place it in the centre of your dish,

hour, and skin it. Have one pound of sausage meat 
prepared, the same of veal minced with a quarter of 
a pound of ham, chestnuts minced may be added 
according to taste, season with white pepper, nutmeg, 
and salt, mix altogether with one breakfast-cupful 
of grated bread, and moisten with two eggs. Place 
the tongue in the centre, and the stuffing around it, 
then form the head into its original shape, fasten 
with a skewer and cord neatly, fringe the ears with 
scissors. When you wish to dress it, place it before 
the fire for an hour^ basting it well, then take a piece 
of butter, and brown with flour in a large sauce-pan, 
add a little boiling water or stock, then put a small 
plate in the bottom of the pan, to prevent the head 
from sticking, lay in the head and stew slowly for 
two hours. Season with white pepper, ketchup, and 
a table-spoonful of vinegar. Have a paste border 
round the dish on which it is going to table, cut off 
the cord, pour the sauce over, and garnish the fore- 
head with slices of lemon. 

TO DRESS calf's HEAD. 

Scald and clean the head, lay it in water for one 
hour or two, wash it and put it into a pot with 
water, skim it when it comes to the boil, let it boil 
slowly for one hour, then take it out, and be careful 
not to break the skin. Let the water remain upon 
the fire to reduce it. When the head is cold, cut 
the meat off both sides of it, skin the tongue, and 
take out the brains. Put the bones in the water in 
which you boiled the head, and boil it until you have 
reduced your stoct to two English pints, then strain 
it When the head is wanted, trim it neatly, cut the 
ears with a pair of scissors in stripes, but do not cut 
them off. Brush it over with beat eggs, and shake 
bread crumbs mixed with flour over it. Put a piece 
of butter in a stew-pan that will hold the head, put 



66 VEAL. 

in the skin side of the head and brown it well, turn 
it over, and when the other side is done, add the one 
half of the stock yon have strained. Shake your steW' 
pan well, and when it boils, cover it close and let it 
simmer for half an hour. Have ready one dozen of 
force meat balls (See Force Meat Balls), and add 
them to it. Have the tongue hot and glazed, season 
with pepper and salt, and a little cayenne, one table- 
spoonful of browning sauce, and one glass of sherry 
wine. Have a paste border upon your dish, dish the 
head with the tongue placed in the centre, and pour 
the sauce with the force meat balls around it. Send 
up brain cakes in a separate dish. (See Brain Cakes.) 
The head dan be dressed up in a different manner, 
by cutting the pieces in two inches square, the tongue 
split up in two and laid upon the top. 

TO PLAIN BOIL A CALF'S HEAD. 

Split it up, wash it well, take out the brains, and 
blanch them for two or three hours. Put on the 
head in a sauce-pan with water and salt, let it boil 
.for one hour and twenty minutes, it will then be done. 
Keep it hot, parboil the brains, and rub them through 
a sieve. Have some parsley minced ; melt a piece of 
butter with a little cream, and add to it the brains, 
parsley, white pepper, and salt. Shake it and make 
it hot. Dish the head, draw out the bones, skin the 
tongue, and pour your sauce over it. 



PORK. 




TO PICKLE A LEG OF PORK. 

Pound half an ounce of saltpetre, one pound and 
a half of salt, and four ounces of sugar. Rub it into 



PORK. 57 

the ham, and turn it daily for iourteen days, it will 
then be ready for use. But if the weather is hot, in 
place of rubbing it dry, make a pickle of salt and 
water, strong enough to carry an egg, and pour it 
over your pork. When you are going to boil it, wash 
it with cold water, and put it upon the fire with as 
much cold water as will cover it. When it boils, 
skim and draw it to the side of the fire, and let it 
boil slowly but constantly for two hours. Serve with 
pease pudding or green pease. 

TO ROAST A LEG OF PORK. 

Have your roast neatly cut, — it should be very 
young pork ; rub over the skin with salad oil, put a 
piece of white paper over it, and put it down to roast, 
a good distance from the fire, one hour. Then draw 
it nearer to the fire, it will require two hours more. 
Half an hour before dinner, take the paper off, so 
that it may become a nice brown. When you dish, 
pour 5alt and water over it. Serve with apple sauce 
in a tureen. 

TO ROAST A LOIN OF PORK. 

Notch every joint of it, cut the skin in stripes, and 
rub it over with a bit of butter, and some sage leaves 
nibbed into a powder. Rub it into your pork before 
putting it to the fire, it will require two hours roast- 
ing. Serve it up with apple sauce. 

TO ROAST A pig's HEAD. 

Bone it, put in stuflSng, the same as used for a 
sucking pig, roll it up, and tie it with a bit cord. 
Hang it up before the fire to roast, baste it well; it 
will require three hours to roast. , Serve it up with 
apple sauce. 

TO ROAST A SUCKING PIG. 

Take a pig three weeks old, stick it above the 



68 PORK. 

breast bone. Rub it over with beaten resin, let it 
lie for a few mimites, then put it into a pan of scald- 
water, and when you find that the hair will come off 
easily, take it out. The hair should all come off with- 
out a knife ; but if it should not, repeat the scalding. 
Wash the pig well in cold water, and take out all the 
entrails. Wash it again in cold water, and dry it 
thoroughly, outside and inside. Have a stuflSng of 
grated bread, minced suet, one onion, and a bit of 
sage J season with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Then 
put the stuffing into the inside, and sew it up. Have 
the white of an egg well beat, and brush the pig over 
with it. Put it to roast at a clear fire ; it will take 
nearly two hours. Have a dish below it to preserve 
the gravy, and when done, cut off the head and di- 
vide it, and take out the brains. Cut the body up 
the middle. Have a little minced sage, boil a little 
butter and the gravy which ran from the pig, mix 
them all together, and make them hot. Dish your 
pig and. serve your sauce up into a sauce- tureen ; or 
you may send it to the table whole, by skewering it 
so as to stand upon its feet, with a roasted apple in 
its mouth. Serve up with apple sauce. 

TO CURE A PORK HAM. 

Pound two ounces of saltpetre, one pound of bay 
salt, and rub it into your ham daily, until you have 
rubbed into it all the salt and saltpetre. Lay it into 
a pickling jar, pour one and a half pound of treacle 
to each ham, turn it every two days, basting them 
with the liquor for four weeks. Take them out, 
wash them with cold water, wipe them, and sew 
them up into a piece of scrim. Smoke them with 
hardwood and sawdust, or peats. If these instruc- 
tions are attended to, the hams will keep for years. 



POULTEY. 59 



POULTRY. 

TO ROAST A TURKEY. 

Have a young cock turkey, singe, pick, and rub it 
well with a dry cloth ; cut the head over by the 
shoulder, leaving the skin long in the front of the 
neck ; cut oiF the points of the toes, and put the legs 
into the fire for a minute, and take the upper skin 
off them ; then draw it, taking care not to break the 
gall nor the gut ; if properly done, it will not require 
to be washed; put in a little salt and pepper into the 
inside, and put the vent over the rump ; have a stuff- 
ing ready, and put it in where the crop was taken 
out ; sew it up, and put a large skewer through the 
wing, the under side of the thigh, and the body, to 
the thigh and wing of the other side ; press down 
the legs, and put another skewer through them, down 
the side of the vent ; have a piece of tape, put it 
firmly round your turkey, and fasten it on the point 
of each of your skewers, to keep the skin of the bird 
from giving way ; fix a piece of paper upon the breast 
of your turkey, put it to roast before the fire; it will 
require one hour and a half ; when the steam draws 
towards the fire it is nearly done ; dredge it with 
flour, baste it with butter, dish it, and garnish with 
sausages, and serve the gravy in a sauce-tureen ; 
have one vegetable flower fixed upon each wing ; or 
you may have force-meat balls, and pour your gravy 
over the turkey. 

TO BOIL A TURKEY. 

Having cleaned your turkey nicely, draw and truss 
it, with the legs drawn in under the skin, and fasten 
them with a bit of tape round the joints, and tie it 
round the rump, to prevent the legs from starting ; 



60 POULTEY. 

have a stuffing prepared with a few chopped oysters, 
and put it in where the crop was taken out ; sew it 
up, put your turkey into a pot which will just hold it, ' 
with the breast down ; cover it with cold water, add 
a tea-cupful of milk, skim it when it comes to boil, 
draw it to the side of the fire, and let it boil slowly; 
if the turkey is young, one hour will boil it, but if 
an old one, it will require two hours. When you 
dish it, take off the tape, and serve with either 
oyster, celery, or plain white sauce, with small white 
turnips and cauliflower. 

ANOTHER WAY TO TRUSS A TURKEY FOR BOILING. 

Have a good large turkey, bone it, take a pickled 
tongue, and boil it for one hour, skin it, trim oflF all 
the fat, turn up the point of the tongue, place the 
tongue into the inside of the turkey, putting the root- 
end of the tongue in the breast ; cut a slit in the 
thin part of the bird, below the apron, to let the 
point of the tongue appear ; have a stuffing of force- 
meat ready, stuff it neatly, and sew it ; run a skewer 
through the turkey and tongue, to keep the turkey 
in a proper shape ; tie it into a floured cloth, put it 
in boiling water, and let it boil slowly but constantly 
for two hours. Dish it, and serve with white sauce 
and boiled cauliflower. 

CAPERATIE. 

When you have a cold turkey, either roasted or 
boiled, take off the legs and wings, cut all the meat 
off the bones, break the bones, put them in aii English 
pint of boiling water, and let it boil until you have 
reduced it to one-half ; then strain it, mince the meat 
of the turkey very small, season with white pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg ; mix a table-spoonful of flour with 
a tea-cupful of thick cream, and add this to the sauce 
you strained from the bones ; put it upon the fire, 



r 



POULTRY. 61 



and stir it until it boils ; put in the mince^ shake 
until it becomes hot, and add a table-spoonful of 
lemon pickle, or hot vinegar; score the legs and 
wings of the turkey, season well with black pepper, 
cayenne, and salt ; broil it over a clear fire until 
they are thoroughly heated ; dish the mince, which 
should be very hot, and lay the legs and wings of 
the turkey upon the top. 

TO BOIL FOWLS. 

Singe and draw your fowls, wash and wipe them, 
put them upon the fire with cold water, and one 
tea-cupful of milk ; skim them when they come to 
the boil ; if a young fowl fifty minutes will do it ; if 
an old one it will take two hours ; have a boiled 
tongue, skin and glaze it. Dish your fowls with the 
tongue in the middle ; have a white sauce ready, 
add a tea-spoonful of lemon pickle to it ; pour your 
sauce over your fowl, or you may serve it up in a 
separate dish and garnish with parsley.

Have small white-skinned chickens, singe and 
draw them, take out all the picks, but do not wash 
them much ; put a little pepper and salt in the in- 
side, put the vent over the rump, and turn the wings ; 
if liked you may put a little veal stuflSng in ; sew 
them up, then put them upon the fire with cold 
water, and let them boil fifteen minutes; you should 
not have them ready long before they are wanted. 
Dish them upon boiled rice or mushrooms ; have a 
little white sauce, and pour over the chickens. 

TO ROAST A FOWL. 

Have a young tender fowl, — an old one will not 
roast to be good ; clean, singe, cut off the toes, take 
x>ff the upper skin of the legs, draw, and truss them ; 



62 POULTRY. 

put a little pepper and salt in the inside of your 
fowl ; press a skewer through the wing and under- 
side of the thigh, through the body, into the thigh, 
and wing of the other side ; take a piece of cord, put 
it firmly round your fowl, and fasten at the point of 
each skewer ; put a skewer through each of the legs, 
to keep the skin of the fowl from giving way ; fix a 
piece of paper upon the breast of your fowl, put it 
before the fire to roast ; three quarters of an hour will 
roast it ; baste well all the time with dripping, and 
before you dish it, shake a little flour on it, a spoon- 
ful of butter melted to froth it ; dish it and pour a 
little boiling water and salt over it. Cold roasted 
fowls and turkeys for supper should be garnished 
with vegetable flowers, and have a fringe of white 
and green paper to garnish their feet and legs witL 

TO ROAST CHICKENS. 

Chickens are a very good substitute for game, 
when game cannot be had. Take three or four small 
chickens, singe and draw them ; cut off" the points of 
the toes, scald the upper skin of the legs, put a little 
stuffing in the breast; sew it up, skewer them as 
above for roasting, put them to a clear fire, and baste 
them well with butter while roasting ; they will re- 
quire twenty minutes ; dish them and pour a little 
rich brown gravy over them ; serve up with bread 
sauce in a tureen. Turkey pullets are done the same 
way. •

table-spoonful of lemon pickle, salt to taste ; if you 
find it is not thick enough, add the yolk of a beat 
egg, put in the jointed chicken, let it become hot, 
but by no means let it boil ; have a paste border 
round your dish, place the chickens neatly round, 
and put the sauce in the centre.

take out the inside, and truss as for boiling. Flatten 
it with your hand, put a little salt and pepper in the 
inside, and lay it on the gridiron on a clear fire, 
putting the inside of the chicken next the fire. 
Melt a little butter, take a few feathers, and keep 
basting it for twenty minutes. Turn it on the other 
side, baste it well for ten minutes, it will then be 
done. Serve it hot with melted butter and minced 
parsley. 

TO ROAST A GOOSE. 

Singe and draw the goose, leaving tte skin long

onions minced, some bread-crumbs, pepper, and salt ; 
mix them all together, and put in the stuffing in the 
goose. Put the vent over the rump, to keep the 
stuffing from dropping out ; pass the skewer through 
the wings and body, and fix a piece of paper over 
the bteast. It will require one hour and a half be- 
fore a clear fire. Ten minutes before you dish it, 
take off the paper, to let the goose brown. When 
you dish it, pour a little salt and water over it Send

clean frying-pan full of boiling-water, break one egg 
in a tea-cup, slip it gently into the boiling-water, 
break and slip in another, and so on until you have 
put in the whole. When the white part is sufficiently 
done, take them out with an egg slice. Have some 
toasted bread cut in square bits, lay one egg upon 
each bit of toast, or upon spinage, minced beef, veal, 
&c. 

EGG BALLS. | 

Boil four eggs for fifteen minutes, take thena out 
and lay them in cold water for ten minutes, then take

flour, and put in the mince. Season with white pep- 
per, cayenne, a tea-spoonful of lemon pickle, and two 
table-spoonfuls of gravy. Stir it over the fire till it 
is well mixed and quite hot. If one lobster, beat up 
one egg, if more, you will require two eggs ; add it 
to the mince, and stir it a little. Take it off, lay it 
upon a dish until it is cold, then make them up in 
the form of lamb cutlets, brush them over with beat 
yolks of eggs, and shake bread crumbs over them. 
Have your frying-pan ready, with plenty of boiling 
drippings, lay them in and fry them, on both sides, a 
nice light brown. Stick into the narrow end of the 
cutlet, a joint of the small claw. Dish them upon a 
napkin round the dish, the one above the other, and 
garnish with a little parsley in the centre. 

You can make oyster cutlets the same way, with a 
small bit of stock in place of the bone.

for soup or other purposes. If you do require it, 
skim it and put them together. Put it upon the fire 
in a stew-pan and let it boil without the cover, to 
reduce it and make it a proper stiffness. Beat the 
whites of three eggs, add it to the jelly, put in the 
egg shells, and stir it with the whisk till it boils five 
minutes. Then pour it in the jelly bag and let it 
run. If it is not clear, pour what has run gently back 
again into the jelly bag. When it is all run through, 
put it into a large dish to cool about one inch deep. 
When you are to garnish with it, cut it in small dia- 
monds, or with a paste cutter, whatever sfrape you

force meat also in the thighs and wings, and sew it 
up the back. Make the fowl into its former shape, 
and run a smaU skewer through its legs and body. 
Rub it over with butter, put it down before the 
fire, and brown it a nice light brown. Have a stew- 
pan with the bones of the fowl, a slice of bacon, two 
onions, a little whole white pepper and salt. When 
this boils, put the fowl into it, cover it closely, and 
let it stew slowly for one hour. Then take out the 
fowl and glaze it a little on the breast. Take an 
ounce of gelatine, dissolve it in half an English 
pint of cold water and half a pint of boiling water, 
stir it, and run it through a bit of muslin. Put 
it in a clean stew-pan, let it boil, add one quart 
of very clear savoury jelly, stir it until it just boils, 
then take it off, and run it through a bit of muslin.

Have a large mould, brush it Inside with salad oil, 
pour savoury jelly into the mould, about two inches 
deep and let it stand till it is firm. The fowl being 
cold, pick out the thread, with which it was sewed, 
put the fowl in the mould with the breast down, and 
pour in a little more jelly until it has almost co- 
vered the legs and wings. Have two eggs boiled 
hard, take off the shells, divide them in two, place 
one at each wing, with the top down, and one at 
each leg in the same way, and put some sprigs of 
curled parsley round each egg. Pour in more jelly, 
until you have filled the mould. When it is per- 
fectly cold, you may use it, or it will keep good for 
^ week. When you are to turn it out, run round 
the edge with a pin, dip your hand in hot water, 
and rub it upon the outside of the mould. Give it 
a shake, put the dish upon the top of the mould, 
and turn it upside down. If it does. not drop out, 
dip a cloth in hot water, wring it, and rub it over 
the mould. Then take it off, and garnish with a 
little parsley. This dish is sent either to breakfast, 
lunch, or supper.

shells of the lobsters, and cut the toes and tails in 
slices. Pound the spawn and mince the bits of eggs 
you cut down, then lay the salad and celery upon a 
dish in a heap. Then build your salad, first laying 
a bit lobster, then a slice of beetroot, then eggs, a 

.slice of an onion, and so on alternately, till you come 
to the top of the salad. Garnish the dish round with 
the radishes, and stick them in between the slices, 
finish it upon the top with the pounded spawn and 
minced eggs. Have some savour jr jelly cut out like 
diamonds, and lay it round the dish. Make a salad 
sauce thus, — take the yolks of two hard boiled eggs,

border on the dish, (See Paste Border), add a little 
salt and mustard, according to taste. Put a little 
maccaroni in the bottom bf the dish, then a little 
cheese and maccaroni alternately, till yOu fill your 
dish. Put small bits of butter over the top, and put

quire ; rub them with a dry cloth, put them in the 
oven, or before the fire ; turn them when they are 
soft, dish them upon a napkin, and sift sugar over 
them. 

TO ROAST APPLES ANOTHER WAY. 

Take as many baking-apples as you require, and 
with an apple-corer core them half way through, 
beginning at the top ; then fill the hole thus made 
with fresh butter and sugar, previously mixed toge- 
ther. While roasting, be sure to keep the top up in 
order to keep in the butter and sugar. Serve on a 
table-napkin.. 

STEWED APPLES WHOLE. 

Have eight apples all one size, peel and take out 
the cores and put them in a brass pan. Lay them in

the bottom, but do not lay them above each other. 
Add as much water as will nearly cover thena, with 
half a pound of loaf sugar. Put them on the fire, 
stew them slowly till soft, then take them oflF, and, 
with a silver spoon, take them out, and put thiem in 
the dish on which they are going to table. Boil down 
the syrup to a very little, and run it through a bit of 
muslin ; pour it round the apples, fill the holes of the 
apples with preserved jam, marmalade, or apple jelly. 

A FLUMMERY OF RICE. 

Wash six ounces of whole rice ; take a quart or 
two English pints of sweet milk, put them in a small 
stew-pan, let it stew slowly till it gets soft and thick. 
Add two ounces of pounded lump sugar, and stir it 
well to mix and dissolve the sugar in it. When per- 
fectly cold, brush a mould over with salad oil, put 
some of the rice in the bottom of the mould, nearly 
an inch thick, and the same all round the sides. 
Press it close to the mould, and leave the centre 
empty ; fill it with strawberry, gooseberry, raspberry, 
or preserved jam of any kind. At dinner time turn 
the dish upside down, draw off the mould carefully, 
and the rice will drop out. Put a little thick cream 
round it in the dish. 

Another way : — Prepare the rice in the mould as 
above ; have some green gooseberries stewed, green 
currants, apples, or rhubarb, and make them thick 
and smooth, then fill the mould. An hour before 
dinner, put it to steam till wanted, and serve it with 
custards in cups.

A BAKED APPLE PUDDING. 

Take one dozen of baking apples small, and all one 
size ; peal and take out the cores, fill the holes with 
sugar, a little pounded cinnamon, and place them 
in a baking-dish. Put a paste border round it. An 
hour before dinner, have a plain custard ready, pour 
in as much as will cover the apples ; put it in the 
oven, and let it remain till it is wanted. Sift pounded 
sugar over it, and cream in a sauce tureen. 

APPLE PIE. 

Have as many good baking-apples as will fill the 
pie-dish. Peel and cut them in four, cut out the 
cores, pack them in the dish closely, and add sugar, 
marmalade, or the juice of lemon. Heap the apples 
high in the centre of the dish ; add more sugar ; have 
a bit of pufi^ paste ready, and with a paste brush egg 
the edge of the dish. Set the pie-dish on the paste 
and run the knife round the outside of the dish, to 
cut the paste the same size. Take it ofi" and cut a 
small bit of paste, the breadth of the border of the 
pie- dish, lay it on lightly and brush it with eggs. 
Lay on the cover, press the paste and border gently 
together with your fingers ; nick it round the edge ; 
take a pen-knife, cut a small bit out of the centre of 
the pie, draw some leaves or flowers on the top, and 
cut them with the knife so as it may be seen. Cut a 
neat rose and put it in the hole in the centre, brush 
it over with an egg, and put it in a quick oven ; one 
hour will bake it. 

APPLE TABT.

them in four, and take out the cores. Put them in a 
brass-pan, with four ounces of white sugar, the grat- 
ing of a lemon, and a little cold water. Let them 
stew slowly till quite soft, then rub them through a 
sieve adding a little of the juice of lemon and more 
sugar if they require it. Have a bit of puff paste 
ready, about a quarter of an inch thick ; have 
a paste cutter, cut out one dozen and a half of 
flowers with it, cut them in two, fold the cuttings 
together, and roll them out the size of the disL Line 
the dish, cut it neatly round the edge, brush over the 
edge of the paste with eggs, and lay the cut flowers 
round it, with the cut side next the dish, the one a 
little above the other, ^nd so on till you go round the 
dish. Then fill it with the stewed apples, with a 
,'knife make them smooth on the top. Cut out some 
flowers, lay them in a regular form on the top, with a 
large one in the centre ; brush it over with egg^ put 
it in a quick oven, half an hour will bake it. Dish it 
with a little dusted sugar over it. 

ANOTHEK WAY TO MAKE AN APPLE TAKT. 

Prepare the apples as the above, have a piece ot 
puff paste ready, fully a quarter of an inch thick, lay 
the dish in which you are to make the tart on the 
paste, cut it round the edge of the dish with a knife, 
to make it the same size. Take off the dish, and, 
with a round cutter, four inches wide, cut a piece out 
of the centre of the paste. Lay the cover aside, and 
take the cutting and roll it out the size of the dish, 
line it and cut it neatly round the edge, fill it with 
the apples and heap them in the centre. Take a 
small bit of paste and a little flour with water, work it 
with your hands till very tough, roll it into small 
straws between your hands, lay them over the centre 
of the dish, closely together, crossing them. Egg the 
edge of your paste, and lay on the cover, nick it

spoon over a clear fire. When it is all fastened, heap 
it upon the middle of the dish in which it is going to 
table ; build the whites of the eggs on the top of it, 
and keep it very high in the centre. Have pounded 
loaf sugar in your dredge box, and shake the sugar 
thick over it. Put it in a quick oven, and brown it 
a little. The moment you take it out of the oven 
send it to table. 

APPLE SOUFFLE. 

Take three pounds of baking apples, peel and cut 
them in four, and take out the cores. Put them on 
in a brass pan, with four ounces of sugar and a tea- 
cupful of water, cover them and stew them till they 
are soft, then press them through a sieve. Separate 
the yolks from the whites of ten eggs, beat up the 
yolks in a basin, with four ounces of loaf sugar ; boil

the top ; put it in a quick oven a few minutes to 
brown. Serve it up hot. 

OBNAMENTED SOUFFLE. 

Make an open tart of any kind of fruit or pre- 
serves ; beat up the whites of six eggs till very stiff, 
shake in six ounces of milled sugar, and with a 
pallet-knife lay it gently on the top of the fruit, 
within the paste border, sift a little sugar over it, 
and put it m the oven till it become a very light

yolks of six eggs with one table-spoonful of sugar 
and four ounces of butter till very light ; add one 
table-spoonful of made mustard, a little cayenne, and 
salt, two table-spoonfuls of ketchup, and a tea-cup- 
ful of very fine bread crumba Beat up the whites 
of six eggs to a snow, and mix them in along with 
the grated cheese. Have a tin shape buttered that 
will hold it easily ; for it rises very much ; pour in 
the souffle. Just when ^ou are dishing your dinner, 
put it in a quick oven, and let it remain until you 
are to send it to table. Serve on a table-napkin, 
ornamented with frilled paper. 

PUFF PASTE. 

To one pound of flour take one pound of butter ; 
if sweet butter, put in a little salt amongst the floury 
pour in water, and work up the flour with your hand 
to a dough. Take it out and lay it upon the table or 
on a marble stone ; knead it till smooth, and divide it 
in two. Roll it out, then make it round and lay it 
aside. Boll out the other piece of dough the same 



PUDDINGS. 123 

size, and take the batter and roll it out the same-size. 
Lay it in betwixt the two pieces of dough, press it 
round th^ edge with your fingers, to prevent the but- 
ter from bursting out. Put a little flour under and 
over it, and roll it out lightly, as broad as you can 
make it. Fold the four sides in the centre, double* 
it over, and then roll it out again. Fold it once 
more, and roll it out a third time ; then it is ready 
for any purpose. Paste should always be put in a 
quick oven when it is ready. If it has to stand for 
any time, cover it up to keep it from the air. You 
may bake paste in winter any where, but in summer, 
when the weather is hot, you should* bake it in as 
cold a place as possible. Common paste for meat 
pies is made exactly the same way as the above, but 
only half a pound of butter to one pound of flour. 

pIste for dumplings. 

Take half a pound of beef suet, finely minced, one 
pound of flour, a little salt, and mix it with cold 
water. Work it with your hand till it is all wet, 
then take it and roll it out upon the table; fold it up, 
and roll it a second time, then it will be ready for 
use. This paste answers for any kind of boiled fruit 
pudding. 

SWEET PASTE. 

Take a pound of flour and six ounces of white su- 
gar. Beat up the whites of two eggs,^ and mix them 
all together with cold water ; knead it well with your 
hand until it is smooth, divide it into two, and roll 
out each piece a quarter of an inch thick. Take half 
a pound of sweet butter, roll it out the size of the 
pieces of paste, lay it in between them, dust your 
rolling pin with flour, press it round the edges with 
your finger to prevent the butter from bursting out, 
roll it out gently, as broad as you can make it, fold 



124 PUDDINGa 

up the four sides in the centre, double it oyer, duSt 
your roller with flour, roll it out again and give it one 
fold, and roll it out a third time, when it will be 
ready for any purpose. This is nice paste and will 
rise very light. It answers for tartlets and all kinds 
•of fruit pies. Do not brush it with e^ ; when 
baked, dust it over with pounded sugar. In making 
pufl^ paste do not fold it above three times ; if it is 
too often folded it will not rise so light. Always 
bake paste in a quick oven. 

TO MAKE TARTLETS. 

Take a piece of puff or sweet paste, roll it out 
about a quarter of an inch thick ; have a pastp cutter 
a size larger than your pattie pans ; cut out a piece 
of paste, put it into the pans and press it down ; put 
in some small bits of bread, press it down at the 
bottom but not at the sides ; put them in a quick 
oven ; when they are a light brown they are done ; 
take out the piece of bread and fill them with jam 
or jelly. 

TO MAKE PASTE FOR RAISED PIES. 

Take two pounds of flour, and a table-spoonful of 
salt. Have half a pound of fresh beef drippings ; 
pour a little boiling water over the drippings when it 
is melted ; add it to the flour with more hot water, 
if necessary ; work it with your hand until it is stiff 
and smooth, and roll it out two or three times. 
This paste answers for small mutton pies. 

RICE PASTR 

Take half a pound of rice flour, rub in a quarter 
of a pound of sweet butter, and one ounce of sugar ; 
mix it up with cold water ; roll it out and dust it 
with flour ; roll out another quarter of a pound of 
-sweet butter, put it inside and fold it up ; roll and 



PUDDINGS. 125 

fold it three times ; dust with white flour, cover 
your tart or pie, and glaze it on the top with eggs.^ 
This does not require a very quick oven. It should 
be used hot and the day it is baked. 

TO MAKE A TABT OF WHOLE APPLES. 

Have a paste case made of puff^ paste ; then peel 
and core twelve apples all one size, put them in 
syrup made of one pound of sugar and half an 
English pint of water, add a little essence of ginger, 
let them boil slowly till soft, but not to break ; then 
take them out, and arrange tastefully into the case. 
Reduce the syrup into a small quantity, and pour 
over them. Sprinkle colouring sugar on the top of 
each apple, or cover with a sugar frame. 

APPLE LOAF. 

Take a pound and a half of apples all one size, 
pare and cut in four and take out the core. Put 
them in a stew-pan with four ounces of sweet- butter 
and half a pound of sugar. Let them stew slowly 
till soft but not to break them. Take them out 
with a spoon and lay them on a sieve that the 
syrup may run from them. When cold, season 
with a little marmalade and cinnamon. Butter a 
pudding mould well — with thin slices of bread or 
finger biscuit line the sides and bottom of the mould. 
Lay the apples in neatly, cover with slices of bread 
buttered on both sides. Brush over with an egg, 
and bake in a moderate oven three quarters of an 
hour. Turn it out and serve with melted butter 
and a glass of wine.

CREAMS AND JELLIES. 

CALF FEET JELLT. ' ' 

Take four calfs' feet, one ox foot, clean and wash 
well. Cut them up, put them in a clean soup pot, 
put in plenty of water, and put them on the fire to 
boil. Skim it well when it comes to the boil ; let 
them all boil to rags, run it through a sieve, and let 
it stand till it is perfectly cold. When you are to 
make the jelly, skim off all the fat of the stock, then 
lay a piece of blotting paper or a wet cloth to take off 
every particle of fat. If you find the stock too soft 
add a little isinglass to it. This quantity of stock will 
make two quarts of jelly. For one quart of jelly, add 
the following ; — put the one half of the stock in a 
brass pan ; have two lemons, and pare the rind very 
thin ; squeeze in the juice of the two, half an ounce of 
stick cinnamon, half a pound of loaf sugar, and a few 
cloves. Beat up the whites of six e^s, put them in 
a pan ; break the shells, add them also. Put it on a 
clear fire, shake it, but do not stir it, and let it boil 
slowly ten minutes. Take it off and add half a bot- 
tle of sherry wine, and put it on the fire to make it 
hot, but do not let it boil. Have your jelly bag in 
hot water, wring it out as hot as your hands can bear 
it, fix it to the jelly stand, pour in the jelly and let 
it run in a basin. Return it again into the bag and 
let it run till clear. If you find it is not so trans- 
parent as you would like, put it in the brass pan, 
beat up the whites of two eggs, put it on the fire, 
throw in the shells into the pan, and let it just boil. 
Then pour it into the jelly bag, and let it run till 
all the jelly is run out of the bag. The jelly stands

should be kept near the fire and covered over with a 
folded table clotL If you wish to make the jelly 
dark, add a glass of brandy ; or colour it, by adding 
a few drops of cochineal. Wet a mould with cold 
water, fill it ; when you are to turn it out, run a pin 
round the edge, dip it in lukewarm water, let a 
little go inside the shape, shake and toss it from 
side to side, pour off the water, put the glass upon 
the top of the mould, turn it up, and let it stand for 
some time, before you draw off the mould. 

TO MAKE A SHAPE OF JELLY WITH GELATINE. 

Dissolve one ounce and a half of Cox's gelatine in 
half an English pint of cold water for fifteen mi- 
nutes ; then add one EnglisH pint of boiling, put it 
into the brass pan, beat up two eggs with the shells, 
the rind and juice of one lemon, half an ounce of 
whole cinnamon, half a pound of loaf sugar, eighteen 
cloves, and a small pinch of hay safiron, previously 
soaked in warm water. Put all on the fire, stirring 
it gently, till it boils five minutes, then add one gill 
of sherry wine, and let it come to the boil again, then 
poiir into the flannel bag and return it until clear. 

TO MAKE A SHAPE OF PRUNES. 

Take a pound and a half of prunes, put them into 
a brass pan, and cover with cold water, put them on 
the fire and let them boil for a minute, then put 
them into a sieve, and run cold water on them, then 
open up and extract the stones, which break, and 
take out the kernels and blanch in boiling water 
for a minute, then take off the brown skin. Dis- 
solve half an ounce of^elatine in an English pint 
of cold water, put it into a brass pan, with a quarter 
of a pound of sugar, let it boil for five minutes, and 
colour with cochineal Season with a few drops of 
the essence of almonds, then fix the prunes and

of isinglass. Dissolve it in a quart of warm milk, 
and add an English pint of good thick cream, six 
ounces of lump sugar, a stick of cinnamon, four bay 
leaves, one dozen of bitter and two dozen of sweet 
almonds, blanched and sliced, a few drops of the 
essence of almonds will answer as well. Put it on 
a clear fire and let it boil for five minutes ; then 
run it through a piece of muslin into a basin, stirring 
occasionally till it is cold. Wet a mould with water, 
and fill it ; when you are to turn it out, follow the 
directions above. 

BLANCMANGE EGGS. 

Have six small eggs, make a small round hole in 
the end, and let the whole inside drop out. Put in 
a little cold water and wash them out ; have a small 
filler, fix the egg shells in a dish amongst salt, and 
fill the eggs with the blancmange. When you are 
to serve them, break the shells, taking care not to 
injure the blancmange. You may put them in a 
glass dish by themselves, or put them round a shape 
of jelly. The proper way to dish them, is to have 
the form of a bird's nest made of calf-feet jelly ; 
proceed as follows: take a china quart basin, wfet it 
with cold water, fill it half full of calf-feet jelly, hold a 
small basin within an inch of the bottom, and fix it 
so as to remain until the jelly is cold and set. When 
you are to send to the table, draw out the small 
basin, run a pin round the jelly, and edge of the 
large basin, do not shake it, turn it over upon a flat 
dish : Take a cloth wrung out of hot water, lay it 
over the basin for a minute, then take off the basin.

which it was mixed, it is removed to the cask, the 
bung hole covered with a tile, and the cask is stirred 
every other day for ten days, and filled up every day, 
as the fluid wastes. The fermentation may continue 
from three to six weeks. When it has subsided, the 
wine is racked into a cask, in which matches dipped 
in sulphur have been burned, or in which a little of 
the sulphate of potash, or of oxymuriate of potash, 
has been put. It should be again racked and fined 
in March, when the wine is completed, and may be 
bottled or allowed to remain in the cask. 

RIPE GOOSEBERRY WINE, 

May be made by the same rule, excluding carefully 
from it all the husks. 

BLACK CITRRANT WINK 

The same varieties of proportions are allowed in 
this as in the others already mentioned. The fruit 
being picked, it is brought to the boiling point, in- as 
much water as to avoid any risk of burning. It may 
then be strained and put into the cask, or the liquid 
and skin^ may, with the other ingredients, be first 
fermented in the vat or tub, by which the wine will 
acquire a higher colour and flavour. 

STRAWBERRY AND RASPBERRY WINE. 

From either of these fruits, agreeable wine may be 
obtained, by following the rules given for making 
currant wine ; but will be found a cheaper and better 
method to add a little syrup or juice of the fruit, to any 
flavourless currant wine, when the fermentation be- 
gins to decline. Currant wine may also be flavoured 
with odoriferous flowers, such as cowslip, elder, 
mignonette ; the quality of roughness is communicated 
by catech and kenochips of oak, and of beech, and 
also the sole, a small quantity of these or of the 



PICKLES. 181 

flowers is put into the cask when the first fermentation 
is over, and as soon as the wine has acquired the de- 
sired flavour it is racked and fined. The flavouring 
articles, such as orrisroot, cloves, ginger, sweet and 
bitter almonds, are put into a muslin bag and hung 
in the cask for a few days, during the stage of insen- 
sible fermentation, that is after the first fermentation 
has ceased. Care being taken to taste the liquor 
frequently, so that the flavouring matter is withdrawn 
as soon as it has produced the desired effect. 

WINE FROM MIXED FRUIT. 

The three varieties of currants may be used in the 
largest proportions, and being nicely picked from the 
stalks, they are allowed just to boil in as much as to 
prevent their burning. Of raspberries, strawberries, 
and cherries, (black heart is the best,) equal quan- 
tities may be allowed ; they are masked with a little 
water. Gooseberries may be used to advantage, but 
must be prepared separately. More powerful bruis- 
ing in an equal quantity of water, and straining 
through a canvas bag, the other fruits being also 
strained. To each gallon of juice thus obtained, four 
pounds of loaf sugar and half an ounce of crude 
tartar are allowed. When the material has stood 
some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is 
removed to the cask and managed as currant wine. 

STRAWBERRY SYRUP. 

Put twenty-four pounds of strawberries into a jar, 
and pour over them four quarts of spring water pre- 
viously acidulated with ten ounces of tartaric acid. 
Let them remain twenty*-four hours, then strain them, 
taking care not to bruise the fruit. To each pint of 
clear liquor, allow one pound of loaf sugar ; stir it 
occasionally. When quite dissolved, pour into a well 
cleaned cask that will just contain it, except about a 



182 PICKLES. 

Suart, which must be left out for the purpose of 
lling up, during the process of fermentation. When 
it ceases, bung up, and let stand for two months, 
when it will be ready for bottling, 

RASPBERRY SYRUP. ' 

Put twenty-four pounds of raspberries into a jar, 
and pour over them four quarts of spring water, pre- 
viously acidulated with ten ounces of tartaric acid, 
Let them remain twenty-four hours, then strain them, 
taking care not to bruise the fruit. To each pint of 
clear liquor, allow one pound of loaf sugar ; stir it 
occasionally. When quite dissolved, pour into a well 
cleaned cask that will just contain it, except about a 
quart, ,which must be kept out for the purpose of 
filling up during the process of fermentation. When 
it ceases, bung up, and let stand for two months, 
when it will be ready for bottling. 

SCOURING SOAP. 

Collect into a barrel all the waste grease, whether 
cooked or raw, scrapings of candles, tallow or 
wax ; iti fact, any fat substance, and to every 
pound of this substance take half a pound of black 
ashes and a quarter of an ounce of rosin, put all 
together into a large pot with as much water as you 
think requisite ; to dissolve these ingredients, a 
. choppin to the pound is generally enough, but some- 
times more requires to be added during the process 
of boiling, which varies in time according as the heat 
is kept up. When you think that all is melted, and 
well mixed together, take out a little and try if it 
will froth as soap ought to do, and if not it must 
boil till it does so. The common time varies from 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours. When all is ready 
pour it into whatever you intend keeping it, while 
not, and do not cover it up till quite cold. , A hot 



PICKLES. 183 

plate is preferable to a fire, in case of the inflammable 
substance boiling over, and which during the process 
of melting must be frequently stirred, and scraped 
from the sides of the vessel. A very small portion 
of this soap does for use, and is admirably adapted 
for scouring unpainted wood, greasy towels, &c. 

TO MAKE COCHINEAL. 

Pound half an ounce of cochineal small, and put 
it on the fire with one quart of water. Let it boil for 
fifteen minutes, stirring all the time ; add half an 
ounce of pounded rock alum and an ounce of cream 
of tartar, and let it come to the boil. Take it off 
and shake in gently half an ounce of salt of tartar ; 
strain it through a piece of cloth, and bottle when 
cold.

the centre two inches in diameter ; fry this also to a 
light brown. Have an egg boiled hard, mince the 
yolk and white separately, and colour the white with 
a little cochineal. When wanted, put the bread in the 
centre of the dish, fill the hole with the minced €^g, 
'and place the pieces of sweetbread round the dish. 
Serve all hot, and garnish with parsley. Pieces of 
wild fowl or rabbit may be dressed in the same way. 

HER majesty's PUDDING.
