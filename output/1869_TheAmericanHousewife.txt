to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

«^ ^^ g articles of food. The same money's worth of a smaller amount 
f^J^j^ , nutritiou^^more healthful, and more invigorating than a much 

of an inferior quality. Therefore, get good food, and

Fresh meats should be kept in a cool place, but not freezing or in actual contact , 
with ice. ' 

Flour and meal should be kept in a cool, dry place, with a space of an inch or 
more between the floor and the bottom of the barrel. 

SuQARS. — Havana sugar is seldom clean, hence not so good as that from BrazQ, 
Porto Rico, and Santa Cruz. Loaf, crushed, and granulated sugars have most 
sweetness, and go further than brown. 

Butter for winter use should be made in mid-autumn. 

Lard that is hard and white, and from hogs under a year old, is best. | 

Cheese soft between fingers is richest and best. Keep it tied in a bag hung in a > 
cool, dry place. Wipe off the mold with a dry cloth. 

Rice, large, clean, and fresh-looking is best 

Sago, small and white, called *^ Pearl," is best. 

Coffee and tea should be kept in close canisters, and by themselves. Purchase 
the former green ; roast and grind for each day's use. 

Apples, oranges, and lemons keep longest wrapped close in paper, and kept in ; 
a cool, dry place. Thaw frozen apples in cold water. 

Bread and cake should be kept in a dry, cool place, in a wooden box, aired in ' 
the sun every day or two. I 

All strong- odored food should be kept by itself, where it can not scent the house. ' 

Bar-soap should be piled up with spaces between them in a dry cellar, having the \ 
air all around it to dry it for months before using ; the drier, the less waste. 

Cranberries kept covered with water will keep for months in a cellar. 

Potatoes spread over a dry floor will not sprout. If they do, cut off the sprouts 
often. If frozen, thaw them in hot water, and cook at once. By peeling off the I 
skin after they are cooked, the most nutritious and healthful part is saved. i 

Corned beef should be put in boiling water, and boil steadily for several hours. \ 

Hominy or ^^ samp" should steep in warm water all njj^ht, and boil all next day 
in an earthen jar surrounded with water. 

Spices and peppers should be ground fine, and kept in tin cans in a dry place. 
A good nutmeg " bleeds" at the puncture of a pin. Cayenne pepper is better for 
all purposes of health than black. * 

Beans, white, are the cheapest and most nutritious of all articles of food in thj 
country. The best mealy potatoes sink in strong salt water. 

Hot drinks are best at meals ; the less of any fluid the better. Any thing c

PREFACE. 



Txs writet does not deem an j apologj neeeatarjr fi>r adding anocner to tlw Ioqa 
M of gaatronomic worka, proyided she has accomplished the desirable object ot 
pioducing a Cook Book which shall commend itself to all persons of true tMt»- 
thiit 9 to say, those whose taste has not been vitiated by a mode of cooking contra 
Tf to her own. Although not a Ude or a Kitchener, she does profess to have suff! 
dest knowledge of the culinary art, as practised by good Jhneriean eook9y to 
InaCJTuct those not versed in this truly interesting science. 

The inefficiency of most works of this kind are well known to all ezperienceu 
liousekeepers, they being generally a mere compilation of receipts, by those who 
kave nopracticai knowledge of the subject, and are consequently unable to judge 
of their correctness, or to give the necessary directions fox putting the ingredients 
together in the right manner. A conviction that a good prtxeticeU Cook Book was 
much needed, induced the writer to exert herself to supply the deficiency. Sh> 
does not luretend to infallibility, but having taken a great deal of pains to have eack 
receipt as correct and nice as possible, she trusts that they will generally give sat- 
isfaction. 

The mode of cooking is such as is generally practised by good American house 
keepers, and the receipts embrace all the various branches of the culinary science, 
from preparing the most simple vegetables or broths, to making the most delics 
cake, creams, sweetmeats, kjc. The writer has endeavored to combine both eeon> 
omy and that which will be agreeable to the palate, but she has never suffered the 
former to supersede the latter. This book is intended for all classes of society, em* 
bracing receipts both for rich and plain cooking, and written in such a plain mab> 
aer, that the most unskilled need not err. Placed in the hands of any servant of 
eommon capacity, who can read, it will set aside the necessity of those frequent 
applications for directions, with which the patience of housekeepers is often tried. 
The experienced cook may smile at the minuteness of the directions ; but, if she 
has witnessed as much good food spoiled by improper cooking as the writer of these 
receipts, she will not think she has been too explicit. 

In regard to the seasoning of food, it has been found impossible to give any 
exact rules, as so much depends upon the quality of the seasoning and food. The 
cook should be carefUl not to have the natural flavor of the food overpowered by 
the seasoning ; and where a variety of spices are used, no one of them should pre* 
lominate. 

Independent of the receipts for cookery, we have annexed a collection of mls> 
^llaneous receipts relative to housekeeping, which, together with the copious 
Qlustrations and directions for carving, we trust will reader it of superior useful- 

aess 

In conclusion, the writer would give her sincere thanks to those of her -fiiends 
vho have kindly furnished her with their choice and valuable receipts : and to 
those into whose iiands the book may fall the would ask a fair trial o'them baton 
wssing Judgment.

PRACTICAL COOKERY. 



1. Ohservations respecting Meat. 

Meat to be in perfection should be kept a number of days 
?men the weather will admit of it. Beef and mutton should 
be Kept at least a week in cold weather, and poultry three 
or four days. If the weather is hot, it will keep but a 
short time. It should be kept in a cool, airy place^ away from 
the fliesj and if there is any danger of its spoiling, a little sah 
should be rubbed over it. When meat is frozen; it shimld be 
put into lukewarm water, and not taken out till the frost is 
extracted. If there is any frost in it when put to the fire, it 
will not cook well. The best way to boil it is to put it 
in cold water, and boil it gently, with just water enough to 
cover it, as it hardens by furious boiling. The part that is to 
be up on the taRe, should be down in' the pot, as the scum tha 
rises is apt to make the meat look dark — ^the scum should be 
taken off as soon as it rises. The liquor in which all kinds 
of fre.«)h meat is boiled, makes a good soup, when thickened 
ind SAaaoned. Boiling is the cheapest way of cooking meat, 
provided you make a soup of the liquor; if not, it is the 
deiirefit, &» most of the gelatine is extracted by the process 
of boiling, ^hich is the most nourishing part, and if not used 
(bi soup, is completely lost. In roasting meat, only the juices 
and iat aro extracted, but not lost, as the juices make good 
gravy, and the fat is good for various culinary purposes. 
When it is put down to roast, there shoula be a little water 
m the dripping pan. For broiling, the bars of the gridiron 
rthculd be peHectly clean, and greased with lard or butter 
otherwise the meat will retain the impression of the bars 
'Phe bars of the gridiron should be concave, and terminate m 
a trouifh, to catch the uices, or they will drop in thr^ fire 



"» MEATS. 

and smoKe the meat. A good fire of hot coals is neces 
sary to have the meat bioil «is quick as possible without bum 
mg. The gridiron should be put on the fire, and well heated 
oefore the meat is laid on it. The dish should be very ho! 
on which broiled meat is put, and it should not be seasoned til! 
taken up. If you wish to fry meat, cut a small piece of perk 
into slices, and fry them a light brown, then take them Uf 
and put in your meat, which should be perfectly dry. When 
the meat is sufficiently fried, take it up, remove the frying pan 
from the fire to cool ; when so, turn in a little cold water foi 
the gravy, put it on the ^x^ — ^when it boils, stir in a little 
n^ixed flour and water, let it boil, then turn it over the meat. 
If not rich enough, add butter and catsup if you like. 

2. Roast Beef. 

The tender loin and first and second cuts off the racit 
are the best roasting pieces — ^the third and fourth cuts are 
good. When the meat is put to the fire, a little salt should 
be sprinkled on it, and the bony side turned towards the fire 
first. When the bones get well heated through, turn the meati 
and keep a brisk fire — baste it frequently while roasting; 
There should be a little water put into the dripping pan when 
the meat is put down to roast. If it is a thick piece, ajjow 
fifteen minutes to each pound to roast it in — ^if thin, less time 
will be required. 

3. Beef Steak. 

The tender loin is the best piece for broiling — a steak from 
the round or shoulder clod is good and comes cheaper. If 
the beef is not very tender, it should be laid on a board and 
pounded, before broiling or frying it. Wash it in cold water, 
then lay it on a gridiron, place it on a hot bed of coals, and 
broil it as quick as possible without burning it. If broiled 
slow, it will not be good. It takes from fifteen to twenty 
minutes to broil a steak. For seven or eight pounds of bee? 
cut up about a quarter of a pound of butter. Heat the platter 
very hot that the steak is to be put on, lay the butter on ii, 
take up the steak, salt and pepper it on both sides. Beef 
steak to be good, should be eaten as soon as cooked. A fc^i 
Stices of salt pork broiled with the steak makes a rich finw 



MSATH 11 

tvith a very little butter. There shcvU dways be a trough tc 
catch the juices of the meat when broied. The same pieces 
that are good broiled are good for frying. Fry a few slices of 
salt pork, brown, then take them up and put in the beef. When 
brown on both sides, taKe it up, take the pan off from the 
. firO) to let the fat cool ; when cool, turn in half a tea cup of 
water, mix a couple of tea spoonsful of flour with a little wa« 
Ser, stir it into the fat, put the pan back on the fire, stir it till 
it boils up, then turn it over the beef. 

4. Alamode Beef. 

The round of beef is the best piece to alamode — the 
shoulder clod is good,|uid comes lower ; it is also good stew, 
ed, without any spices. For five pounds of beef, soak about 
a pound of bread in cold water till sofl, then drain off th(» 
water, mash the bread fine, put in a piece of butter, of the 
size of a hen's egg, half a tea spoonful of salt, the same quan • 
tity of ground cloves, allspice, and pepper, half a nutmeg, a 
couple of eggs, and a table spoonful of flour — ^mix the whole 
well together ; then cut gashes in the beef, and fill them with 
about half of the dressing, put the meat in a bake-pan, with 
lukewarm water enough to cover it;» set it where it will stew 
getitly for a couple of hours, cover it with a heated bake pan 
lid. When it has stewed a couple of hours, turn the reserved 
dressing on top of the meat, heat the bake pan lid hot enough 
to brown the dressing, stew it an hour and a half longer. Af- 
ter the meat is taken up, if the gravy is not thick enough, 
mix a tea spoonful or two of flour with a little water, and stir 
Jt into the gravy ; put in a little butter, a wine glass of wine 
and turn it over the meat. 

5. Beef Liver. 

Liver is very good fried, but the best way to cook it, is to 
broil it ten minutes, with four or five slices of salt pork. 
Then take it, cut it into small strips together with the pork 
put it in a stew pan, with a little water, butter, and pepper 
Biew it four or five minutes.

nn (lunce of sall-petre, quarter of a pound of brown cnigar-^ 
(some people use moladses, but it is not as good)-.no boiling 
is necessary. Put the beef in the 'brine. As long as any dalt 
remains at the bottom of the cask it is stroi^ enough. 
Whenever any scum rises, the brine should be scalded, 
skimmed, and more sugar, salt and salt-petre added. When 
a piece of beef is put in the brine, rub a little salt over it. If 
the weather is hot, cut a gash to the bone of the meat, and 
fill it with salt. Put a heavy weighion the beef in order to 
keop it under the brine. In very hot weather, it is difficult to 
com beef in cold brine before it spoils. On this account it 
is good to com it in the pot wheti boiled. It is done in 
the following manner ; to %\x or eight pounds of beef, put 
a tea cup of salt, sprinkle flour on the side that is to go up 
on ihe table, and put it down in the pot, turn the water into 
the pot after the beef is put in, boil it a couple of hours, then 
turn in more cold water, and boil it an hour and a half longer 

7. M.uttjon. 

The saddle is the best part to roast — ^the shoulder and leg 
are good roasted ; but the best mode to cook the latter, is 
to boil it with a piece of salt pork. A little rice boiled with it, 
improves the looks of it. Mutton for roasting, should have 
a little butter rubbed on it, and a little salt and pepper 
sprinkled on it — some people like cloves and allspice. Put a 
small niece of butter in the dripping pan, and baste it fre- 
quently. The bony side should be turned towards the fire first, 
and roasted. For boiling or roasting mutton, allow a quar- 
ter of an hour to each pound of meat. The leg is good cut 
in gashes, and filled with a dressing, and baked. The dressing 
is made of soaked bread, a little butter, salt, and pepper, and 
a couple of eggs. A pint of water with a little butter should be 
put in t he pan. The leg is also good, cut ititc> slices and broiled. 
It is good corned a few days, and then boiled. ^ The rack iff 
good for broiling — ^it should be divided, each bone by itselC 
broiled quick, and buttered, salted and peppered. The 
breast of mutton is nice baked. The joints of the brisket should 
be separated, the sharp ends of the ribs sawed off, the out 
side rubbed over with a little piece of butter — salt it, and pu* 
it in a baKo nan, with a pint of water. When QOtie, take it 



XBATS. 13 

lip, and tnickcn the gravy with a little flour and water, and 
Dut in a small piece of butter* A table spoonful of catsup, 
cloves and allspice, improve it, but are not essential. The 
neck of mutton makes a good soup. Parsely or celery-heads 
are a pretty garnish for mutton. 

8. VeaU 

The loin of veal is the best piece for roasting. The breast 
onq rack are good roasted. The breast also is good made 
into a pot pie, and the rack cut into small pieces and broiled, 
fhe leg is nice for frying, and when several slices have been 
cut off for cutlets, the remainder is nice boiled with a small 
piece of salt pork. Veal for roasting should be salted, 
peppered, and a little butter rubbed on it, and basted fre- 
quently. Put a little water in the dripping pan, and unless the 
meat is quite fat, a little butter should be put in. The fillet 
is good baked, the bone should be cue out, and the place 
filled with a dressing, made of bread soaked soA in cold 
water, a little salt, pepper, a couple of eggs, and a table 
spoonful of melted butter put in-^then sew it up, put it in 
your bake pan, with about a pint of water, cover the top of 
the meat with some of the dressing When baked suffi- 
ciently, take it up, thicken the gravy with a little flour and 
water well mixedj put in a small piece of butter, and a little 
wine and catsup, if you Uke the gravy rich. 

. 9. Veal Cutlets. 

Fry three or four slices of pork until brown-— take them spv 

then put in slices of veal, about an inch thick, cut from the 

leg. When brown on both sides, take them up — stir half a 

pint of water into the gravy, then mix two or three tea 

spoonsful of flouf with a little water, and stir it in — soak a 

y)uple of slices of toasted bread in the gravy, lay them on 

he bottom of the platter, place the meat and pork over it, 

hen turn on the gravy. A very nice way to cook the cut- 

ets, is to make a batter with half a pirA of milk, an egg 

Deacen to a froth, and fbur enough to render it thick. 

When the veal is fried brown, dip it into the batter, then put 

X back into the fat, and fry it until brown again. If you 

:)ave any batter efU it is nice Crooned by the lar^e spoonful 



14 MRATS. 

into the fat, and fried till brown, then laid over the vetL 
ThicKen the gravy and turn it over the whole. It takes aboiu 
an hour to cook this dish. If the meat is tough, it will be 
better to stew it half an hour before frying it. 

10. Calf s Head. 

BoL the head two hours, together with the lights and feel. 
Put in the liver when it has boiled an hour and twenty min- 
utes. Before the head is done, tie the brains in a bag, and 
boil them with it ; when the brains are done, take them up, 
season them with salt, pepper, butter, and sweet herbs, or 
spices if you like — ^use this as a dressing for the head. Some 
people prefer part of the liver and feet for dressing — they are 
prepared like the brains. The liquor that the calf's head ia 
Doiled in, makes a good soup, seasoned in a plain way like 
any other veal soup, or seasoned turtle fashion. The liquor 
should stand until the next day after 'the head is boiled, in 
order to have the fat rise, and skimmed off. If you wiph to 
have your calf's head look brown, take it up when tender, 
rub a little butter over it, sprinkle on- salt, pepper, and allspice 
—sprinkle flour over it, and put before the fire, with a Dutch 
oven over it, or in a brick oven where it will brown quick. 
Warm up the brains with a little water, butter, salt, apd 
pepper. . Add wine and spices if you like. Serve it up as a 
dressing for the head. CalTs head is also good, baked. 
Halve it, rub butter over it, put it in a pan, with about a quart 
of water ; then cover it with a dressing made of bread soak- 
ed soft, a little butter, an egg, and season it with salt, pepper, 
and powdered mace. Slice up the brains, and lay them in the 
pan with the head. Bake it in a quick oven, and garnish «' 
with slices of lemon, or force meat balls. 

11. Force Meat Balls. 

Chop a pound or two of veal fine — ^mix it with one or two 
ggB, a little butter, or raw pork chopped fine — season it with 
salt and pepper, or curry powder. Do them up into balls 
Aoout the size of half an tgg, and fry them brown. 

12. Calfs Feet. 
Boil them with the head, until tender, then split and lo^ 



MEATS. 15 

jieni round the head, or dredge them with flour afler the> 
Aave been boilftd tender, and fry tliem )rown. If you wish 
for gravy for them, when you have taken them up, stir a lit- 
tie flour into the fat they were fried in ; season it with salt, 
peppor, and mace. Add a little butter and wine if you like* 
tier turn it over the feet. 

13. Cdy^s Liver and Heart. 

Are good, broiled or fried. Some people like the liver 

stuffed and baked. 

* 

14. Collops, 

Cut part of a leg of veal into pieces, three or four inches 
broad — sprinkle flour on them, fry them in butter until brown, 
then turn in water enough to cover the veal. When it boils, 
take off the scum, put in two or three onions, a blade of 
mace, a little salt and pepper. When stewed tender, take 
up the meat, thicken the gravy with flour and water, mixed 
smoothly together, squeeze in the juice of half a lemon, then 
turn it over the collops. Garnish them with a lemon cut in 
thin slices. 

15. PJaw. 

Boil a piece of lean veal till tender. Take it up, cut it 
mto strips three or four inches long, put it back into the pot, 
with the liquor it was boiled in, with a tea cup of rice to three 
pounds of veal. Put in a piece of butter, of the size of a 
hen's egg ; season it with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs if 
you like ; stew it gently till the rice is tender, and the water 
nearly stewed away. A little curry powder in this, converts 
It into a curry dish. 

16. A JbUlet of Veal. 

Cut off the shank of a leg of veal, and cut gashes in t!ie 
lemainder. McJ^e a dressing of bread, soaked soft in cold 
tvater, and mashed ; season it with salt, pepper, and sweet 
herbs , chop a little raw pork fine, put it in the dressing, and 
if yoii have not pork, use a little butter instead. PIU the 
gariios in the meat with part of the dreasing, put it in a bake 
pan, with Just water enough to cover it put the remainder 



16 M[BAT8. 

of tlie dressing on top of the meat, and cover it with a hett*. 
ed bake pan lid. For six pounds of veal, allow two hours 
steady baking. A leg of veal is nice prepared in tius man 
ner, and roasted. 

17. Lamb. 

The fore and hind nyniers are good roasting piecc^i 
Sprinkle salt and pepper on Lie lamb, turn the bony side t> 
wards the fire first ; if not fiit, rub a little butter on it, 
and put a little in the dripping pan ; baste it frequently. 
These pieces are good stufied like a fillet of veal, and roasted. 
The leg is also good, cooked in the same manner ; but it ia 
better boiled with a pound of salt pork. Allow fifteen minutes 
boiling to each pound of meat. The breast of lamb is good 
roasted, broiled, or corned and boUed ; it is also good made 
into a pot pie. The fore quarter, with the ribs divided, is 
good broiled. The bones of this, as well as all kinds of 
meat, when put down to broil, should first be put towards the 
fire, and browned before the other side is broiled. A little salt, 
pepper, and butter, should be put on it when you take it up. 
Lamb is very apt to spoil in warm weather. If you wish (o 
keep a leg several days, put it in brine. It should not be put 
with pork, as fresh meat is apt to injure it. Lamb's head 
feet, and heart, are good, boiled till tender, then cut off the 
fiesh from the head, cut up the heart, and split the feet in two ; 
put the whole into a pan, with a pint of the liquor they were 
boiled in, together with a little butter, pepper, salt, and lialf 
a tea cup of tomato catsup ; thicken the gravy with a httle 
fiour ; stew the whole for a few moments. Pepper-grasa oi 
parsely, are a pretty garnish for this dish. 

18. Shoulder of Lamh Chined. 

The shoulder of lamb is good roasted plain, but is better 
cooked in the following manner. Score it in checkers, about 
eoi inch long, rub it over with a little butter, and the yelk of 
an egg; then dip it iiiij finely pounded bread crumbs, 
sprinkle on salt, pepper, aad sweet herbs; roast it till of a 
light brown. This is good with plain gravy, but better with 
a sauce, made in the following manner. Take a quarter of 
f^ pint of the drippings from the meat, mix it with the saim* 



HSAT8. n 

qoantity of water, set it on the fire , when it boils up, thick* 
en t with a little flour and water mixed, put in a table spoon* 
fu. of tomato catsup, the juice and grated rind of a 'emon 
season it with salt and pepper. 

10. Lamb'** Fry. 

The heart and sweet bread are nice fried plainly, or dip- 
ped into a beaten egg and fine bread crumbs. They should 
be fried in lard. 

20. Turkey. 

Take out the inwards, wash both the inside and outside of 
die turkey. Prepare a dressing made of bread, soaked soft 
in cold water, (the water should be drained from the bread, 
and the bread mashed fine.) Melt a small piece of butter 
and mix it with the dressing, or else put in salt pork, choppea 
fine ;' season it with salt and pepper ; add sweet herbs if you 
Kke* An egg in the dressing, makes it cut smoother. Any 
kind of cooked meat is nice minced fine, and mixed with the 
dressing. If the inwards are used, they ought to be boiled 
very tender, as it is very difficult to cook them through while 
the turkey is roasting. Fill the crop and body of the turkey 
with the dressing, sew it up, tie up the legs and wings, rub on 
a little salt and butter. Roast it from two to three hours, 
according to its size ; twenty-five minutes to every pound, is 
a good rule. The turkey should be roasted slowly at first, 
and basted frequently. A little water shouM be put into the 
dripping pan, when the meat is put down to roast. For a 
gravy to the turkey, take the liquor that the inwards are 
boiled in, put into it a little of the turkey drippings, set it 
where it will boil, thicken it with a little flour and water 
previously mixed smooth. Season it with salt, pepper, and 
^weet herbs if you like. Drawn butter is used for boiled 
turkey. A turkey for boiling should be prepared in the same 
manner as one for roasting. U you wish to have it look 
white, tie it up in a cloth, unless you boil rice in the pot. If 
rice is used, put in two-thirds of a tea cup. A pound or two 
of salt pork, boiled with the turkey, improves it. If you wish 
U) make a soup of the liquor in which the turkey is boiled, 

2*

(fit it remain until the next day, then skim off the fat Heal 
and season it 

21. Goose. 

If a goose is tender under the wing, and you can Irodk 
Jie skin easily by running the head of a pin across itw 
breast, there is no danger of its being tough. A goo»€ 
should be dressed in the same manner, and roasted the aaniw 
.ength of time as a turkey. ' 

22. Chickens, 

Chickens for roasting or boiling should have a dressing 
prepared like that for turkies. Half a tea cup of rice boiled 
with the chickens makes them look white. They will be \esH 
liable to break if the water is cold when they are put in. 
A little salt pork boiled with the chickens, improves them. If 
you do not boil pork with them they will need salt. Chickens 
for broiling should be split, the inwards taken out, and the 
chicken washed inside and out. Put the bony side down on 
the gridiron, and broil it very slowly until brown, then turn 
tt, and brown it on the other side. About forty minutes is 
required to broil a common sized chicken. For roast 
chicken, boil the liver and gizzards by themselves, and use 
the water for gravy to the chickens— cut the inwards in slices, 
and put them in the gravy. 

23. Fricassee. 

The chickens should be jointed, the inwards taken out, and 
the chickens washed. Put them in a stew pan with the skin 
side down ; on each layer sprinkle salt and pepper ; put in 
three or four slices of pork, just cover them with water, and 
let them stew till tender. Then tak<^ *Hem up, mix a little 
flour and water together, and thicken the liquor they were 
stewed in, add a piece of butter of the size ^f a hen's egg> 
flien put the chickens back in the stew pan, and 'et them stew 
four or five minutes longer. When you have taken up the 
chickens, soak two or three slices of toast in the gravy, then 
put them in your plattef, lay the chickens over the toast, and 
turn th3 gra\y on them. If you wish to brown the chickens^ 
sslew them withou* the pork* till tender, then fry the pork 



MEATS. 19 

blown, take it up, piit in the chickens, and them fry until a 
a Jght brown. 

24. Pigeons, 

Take out the inwards, and stuff the pigeons with a dressi 
ing prepared like that for turkeys, lay them in a pot with 
the orcast side down. Turn in more than enough water to 
cover them. When stewed nearly tender, put in a quarter 
of a pound of butter to every dozen of pigeons — ^mix two 
or three tea spoonsful of flour, with a little water, and stir into 
the gravy. If you wish to brown them, put on a heated 
bake pan lid, an hour before they are done, or else take them 
up when tender, and fry them in pork fat. They are very 
good split open and stewed, with a dressing made and 
warmed up separately with a little 6f the gravy. Tender 
pigeons are good stufled and roasted. It takes about two 
hours to cook tender pigeons, and three hours tough 
ones. Roast pigeons should be buttered when put to the 
fire. 

25. Ducks. 

Are good stewed like pigeons, or roasted. Two or three 
onions in the dressing of wild ducks, tstkes out the fishy taste 
they are apt to have. If ducks or any other fowis are 
slightly injured by being kept long, dip them in weak sale- 
ratus water before cooking them. 

26. Baked or Roast Pig. 

A pig for roasting or baking should be small and fat. Take 
out the inwards, and cut off the first joint of the f^et, and 
boil them till tender, then chop them. Prepare a dressing of 
bread soaked soft, the water squeezed out, and the bread 
mashed fine, season it with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs, 
add a little butter, and fill the pig with the c.*essing. Rub a 
littlo Vitter on the outside of the pig, to prevent its blistering 
Bakd or roast it from two hours and a half, to three hours 
Tj&s pan that the pig is baked in should have a little water put in 
it. When cooked, take out a little of the dressing and gravy 
from the pan, mix it with the chopped inwards and feet, put 
In a liitlc butter, pepper, and. salt, and use .his for a sauce to 



so MEATS. 

iio pig. Expose the pig to the open air two or throe min 
ute^ before it is put on the table, to make it crispy. 

27. Sweet Breads Liver^ and Heart. 

A very good way to cook the sweet breao, is tc fr} tare(9 
01 four slices of pork till brown, then take them vp ano piC 
in the sweet bread, and fry it oyer a moderate fire. ^hcQ 
you have taken up the sweet bread, mix a couple of tea« 
spoonsful of flour with a little water, and stir it into the fiit-« 
let it boil, then turn it over the sweet bread. Another way 
is to parboil them, and let them get cold, then cut then in 
pieces about an inch thick, dip them in the yelk of an egg) 
and fine bread crumbs, sprinkle salt, pepper, and sage on 
them, before dipping them in the egg, fry them a light brown. 
Make a gravy after you have taken them up, by stirring a 
little fiour and water mixed smooth into the fat, add spices 
and wine if you like. The liver and heart are good cooked 
in the same manner, or broiled. 

28. Pressed Head. 

Pig's head is good baked with beans, or corned and 
smoked. It is also nice prepared with spices in the follow, 
ing manner. Boil the ears, forehead, and rind, (the cheek 
is good, but it is better corned and smoked,) till the meat will 
almost drop from the bones ; take them up ; when cold cut the 
meoX in strips about an inch long, warm it in a little of the 
liquor in which the meat was boiled, season it with salt, 
pepper, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. Put it while hot in 
a strong bag, put a heavy weight upon it, and let it remain 
till perfectly cold. When you wish to eat it, cut it in thin 
slices. 

29. Souse^ 

TaKe pig's ears and feet, clean them thoroughly, then soai 
them in salt and water, for several days. Boil them tender 
and split them, they are then good fried. If you wish tc 
souse them when cold, turn boiling vinegar en them spicer 
with pepper-corns, and mace. Cloves improve the taste 
but it turns them a dark color. Add a littie salt. They wi, 
keep good pickled five or six weeks. Fry them in lard. 



BIBAT8. SI 

30. Tripe. 

Af)ar lieing scoured, should be soaked io salt and watei 
seven or eight days, changing the water every other day 
then boil it till tender, which will take eight or ten hours* 
It is then fit for broiling, frying, or pickling. It is pickled in 
ihe same manner as souse. 

31. Sausages, 

Qiop fresh pork very fine, the lean and fat together, (there 
should be rather more of the lean than the fat,) season it 
highly with salt, pepper, sage, and other sweet herbs, if you 
Hke them — a little salt-petre tends to preserve them. To tel 
whether they are seasoned enough, do up a little into a cake, 
and fry it. If not seasoned enough, add more seasoning, 
and fill your skins, which should be previously cleaned 
thoroughly. A little flour mixed in with the meat, tends to 
prevent the fat from running out when cooked. Sausage- 
meat is good, done up in small cakes and fried. In summer, 
when fresh pork cannot be procured, very good sausag^e- 
cakes may be made of raw beef, chopped fine with salt 
pork, and seasoned with pepper and sage. When sausages 
are fried, they should not be pricked, and they will cook 
nicer, to have a little fat put in the frying-pan with them. 
They should be cooked slowly. If you do not like them very 
fat, take them out of the pan when nearly done, and finish 
cooking them on a gridiron. Bologna sausages are made 
of equal weight each, of ham, veal, and pork, chopped very 
fine, seasoned high, and boiled in casings, till tender, then 
dried. 

32. Ham. 

A ham that weighs ten pounds, should be boiled four or 
five hours ; if very salt, the water should be changed. Be- 
k>rii it is put on the table, take off the rind. If you wish to 
oriK^ment it, put whole cloves, or pepper, in tfie form of 
diarr\onds, over it. The Virginia method of curing hams, 
(wh'ch is considered very superior), is to dissolve two 
oun'>es of salt-petre, two tea spoonsful of saleratus, in a salt 
|HQi <e, ai strong as possible, fi>r every sixteen pounds of hanib 



22 MBAT8. 

add molasses in the proi)ortion of a gallon to a hogshead ai 
brine, then put in the hams, and let them remain three 
or four weeks. Then take them out of the brine, and 
smoke them with the hocks downwards, to preserve the 
juices. They will smoke tolerably well, in the course 
of a month, but they will be much better, to remain in th^ 
smoke-house two or three months. Hams cured in this man« 
Der are very fine flavored, and will keep good a long time 

33. Tongues. 

Cut off the roots of the tongues, they are not good smoked, 
btit they make nice pies. Take out the pipes and veins, 
boil them till tender, mince them fine, season the meat 
with salt, cloves, mace, and cinnamon, put in a little sugar aLd 
molasses, moisten the whole with brandy, put it in a coal 
place, and it will keep good several months in cold weather, 
and is good to make pies of at any time, with ^e addition cf 
apples chopped fine, and a little butter melted. For the n> 
maibder of the tongues, make a brine in the following man- 
ner — ^to a gallon of cold water, put a quart of rock salt, an 
ounce of salt-petre, quarter of a pound of sugar, and a couple 
of table spoonsful of blown salt. Put in the tongues, let 
them remain in it ^ week, and tlien smoke them eight or ten 
days. 

34. Curries, 

Chickens, pigeons, mutton chops, lobsters and veal, all 
njake good curries. If the curry dish is to be made of fowls, 
they should be jointed. Boil the meat till tender, in just suf- 
ficient water to cover it, and add a little salt. Just before the 
meat is boiled enough to take up, fry three or four slices of 
pork till brown — take them up, and put in the chickens. Let 
them brown, then add part of the liquor in which they were 
boiled, one or two tea spoonsful of curry powder, and the 
fried pork. Mix a tea spoonful of curry powder with a tea 
cup of boiled nee, or a little flour and water mixed — turn ii 
on to the curry, and let it stew a few minutes. 

85. Chicken Pte. 
Joint the chickens, whi !h should be young and tenoar-* 



^ MSATS. S^ 

t)oi1 them in use sufficient water to co/er them. When 
uenriy tender, ^ke them out of the liquor, and lay them in a 
deep pudding dish, lined with pie crust. To each layer of 
chicken, put three or four slices of pork — add a little of the 
iiqubr in which they were boiled, and a couple of ounces of 
butter, cut into small pieces— nsprinkle a little flour ove^ the 
«rhole, cover it with nice pie crust, and ornament the top with 
some of your pastry. Bake it in a quick oven one hour. 

36. Beef and MutUm Pie. 

Take tender meat, pound it out thin, and broil iV ^n min- 
utes — ^then cut off the bony and gristly parts, season it high, 
ly with salt and pepper, butter it, and cut it into small pieces. 
Line a pudding dish with pastry, put in the meat, and to each 
layer add a tea spoonful of tomato catsup, together with a 
table spoonful of water — sprinkle over flour, and cover it with 
pie crust, and ornament as you please with pastry. Cold 
roast, or boiled beef, and mutton, make a good pie, by cut- 
ting them into bits, and seasoning them highly with salt and 
pepper. Put them into a pie dish, turn a little melted but- 
ter over them, br gravy, and pour in water till you can lust 
see it at the top. 

37. Chicken and Veal Pot Pie. 

If the pie is to be made of chickens, joint them — ^boil the 
meat until about half done. Take the meat out of the liquor 
m which it was boiled, and put it in a pot, with a layer of crust 
to each layer of meat, having a layer of crust on the top. 
The meat should be seasoned with salt and pepper — cover 
Jie whole with the boiled meat liquor. If you wish to have 
the crust brown, keep the pot covered with a heated bake pan 
lid. Keep a tea kettle of boiling water to turn in as the wa- 
ter boils away— cold water makes the crust heavy. The 
crust for the pie is good like that made for fruit pies, with leas 
shortening, but raised pie crust is generally preferred to any 
olher. It is made in the following manner — ^mix together 
three pints of flour, a tea cup of melted butter, a tea spoon- 
ful of salt, then turn in half a tea cup of yeast — add cold 
water to make it sufficiently stiff to roll out. Set it in o 
warm place to rise, which wiU take seven or eight hours. 



84 OUATS. 

unlcsn brewer's yeast is used. When risen, roll it out and 
cut it into small cakes. Potatoe pie crust is very nice. To 
make it, boil eight or nine small potatoes, peel and mash them 
fine, mix with them a piece of butter, .of the size of a hen's 
egg, a tea spoonful of salt, a tumbler full of milk, and floor 
to render it of the right consistency to roll out. When 
rolled out, cut them into cakes, and pat them with the meat. 
If you happen to have unbaked wheat dough, very good crust 
may be made of it, by working into it a little lukewarm melted 
butter. Let it remain, after you have rolled ^d cut it into 
cakes, about ten or fifteen minutes, before putting it with the 
meat* 

38. To Frizzle Beef . / 

Take beef that is fresh smoked and tender— «have it off 
thin, put it in a stew pan, with water enough to cover it — let 
it stew ten or fifteen minutes. Three or four minutes before 
it is taken up, mix a little flour and water together, and stir 
m, to thicken the water; add a little butter and pepper. This 
makes a good dish for breakfast-— eggs are a nice accom- 
paniment to it. 

39. Warmed Over Meats. 

Boiled or roasted veal makes a nice dish, chopped fine, 
and warmed up, with just sufficient water to moisten it, and 
a little butter, salt, and pepper, added. A little nutmeg, and 
the grated rind of a lemon, improve it — none of the white 
part of the lemon should be used. When well heated through 
take it up on a platter, and garnish it with a couple of lemons 
cut in slices. Fresh or corned beef is good minced fine, with 
boiled potatoes, and warmed up with salt, pepper, and a little 
water — add butter, just before you take it up. Some people 
ase the gravy that they have left the day before, for the meat, 
but it is not as good when watmed over, and there is no need 
of its being wasted, as it can ie clarifieQ, and used for other 
purposes. Boiled onions, or turnips, are good mixed with 
mince meat, instead of potatoes. Veal, lamb,; and mutton, 
are good cut into smail strips, and warmed with boiled 
potatoes cut in slices, pepper, salt, a UttJe water — add butter 
i<]st before you ta^^e it up. Roast beef and mutton, if noi

previously cooked too much, are nice cut in slices, and just 
scorched on a gridiron. Meat, when warmed over, should 
be on the fire just long enough to get well heated througl^^ 
if on the fire long, most of the juices of the meat will be 
extracted, and render it very indigestible. Cold fowls are 
nice jointed, and warmed with a little water, then taken up 
and fried in butter till brown. A little flour should be sprin. 
lied on them before frying. Thicken the water that the 
fowls were warmed in-^-add a little salt, pepper, and buttor« 
und turn it over the fowls. 

40. A Ragout of Cold Veal. 

Cut boiled or roasted veal in nice slices — ^flour and fry 
chem in butter, till a light brown — then take them up, and 
turn a little hot water into the butter they were fried in, mix 
a little flour and water together, and stir it into the gravy-—

1 pint of boiling water — ^let it boil two or three minutes, then 
cut up about a quarter of a pound of butter into small pieces, 
and put it with the flour and water — set it where it will melt 
srradually. If carefully mixed, it will be free from lumps — ^if 
not, strain it before it is put on the table. If the butter is to 
be eaten on fish, cut up several sofl boiled eggs into it. A 
httle curry powder sprmkled into it, will convert it into curry 
sauce. 

42. Burnt Butter* 

Put a couple of ounces oC butter into a fr3ring pan— set it 
m the fire— when of a dark brown color, put in half a tea 
0U]> full of vinegar, a little pepper and salt. This is nice for 
Ssh, salad, or eggs.

water in the dripping pan. A little while before the meat Js 
done, stir up the drippings, put it in a skillet, and set it wheri 
it will boil. Mix two or three tea spoonsful of fiour smoothly 
with a little "water, and stir it in the gravy when it boila 
Lamb and veal require a little butter in the gravy. The gra- 
vy for pork and geese, should have a little of the dressing 
and sage, mixed with it. If you wish to have your gravies 
kx>k dark, scorch the flour that you thicken them with, wnich 
is easily done by putting it in a pan, setting it on a few coals, 
and stirring it constantly till it is a dark brown color, taking 
care that it does not burn. Enough can Oe burnt at once to 
last a long time.

with a little water, and stir it in when the gravy boils. Sea- 
son it with salt, pepper, and cloves — stir a table spoonful of 
currant jelly in, and just before you take it from the fire, half 
a tumbler of wine. Many people prefer melted currant jelly 
to any other sauce for venison or mutton. 

46. Rice Sauce. 

Boil one onion and half a tea cup of rice with a blade of 
mace, till very soft, in just water enough to cover it — then 
stir in half a pint of milk, a little salt, and strain it. This io

mix them with a couple of table spoonsful of olive oil, or 
melted butter, two thirds of a tumbler of vinegar, a tea spoon, 
^ul of mixed mustard, a tea spoonful of salt, a little pep- 
per, and essence of celery, if you have it — if not, it can be 
dispensed with. 

54. Sauce for Turtle^ or Calf^s Head* 

To half a pint of hot melted butter, or beef gravy, put the 
juice and grated rind of half a lemon, a little sage, basil, or 
sweet marjorum, a little cayenne, or black pepper, and salt. 
Add a wine glass of white wine just before you take it up. 

55. Apple and Cranberry Sauce, 

Pare and quarter the apples — ^if not tart, stew them in ci. 
der — ^if tart enough, stew them in water. When stewed soft, 
put in a small piece of butter, and sweeten it to the taste, 
with sugar. Another way, which is very good, is to boil the 
apples, without paring them, with a few quinces and molasses, 
in new cider, till reduced to half the quantity. When cool, 
strain the sauce. This kind of sauce will keep good several 
months. It makes- very good plain pies, with the addition of 
a little cinnamon or cloves. To make cranberry sauce, no 
thing more is necessary than to stew the cranberries till soft 
then stir in sugar and molasses to sweeten it. Let the sugai 
E»ald in it a few minutes. Strain it if you like-^it is ver) 
good without straining. 

56. Pudding Sauce.

Take ripe tomaios, and prick them with a foric — ^lay them 
in a deep dish, and to eacli layer put a layer of salt. Let 
diem remain in it four or f ve days, then take them out of the 
salt, and put them in vinegar and water for one night. Drain 
off the vinegar, and to each peck of tomatos put half a pint 
of mustard seed, half an ounce of cloves, and the same quan* 
tity of pepper. The tomatos should be put in a jar, with a 
layer of sliced onions to each layer of the tomatos, and the 
spices sprinkled over each layer. In ten days, they wOi be 
in good eating order. 

58. Tomato Catsup, 

Vo a gallon of ripe tomatos, put four table spoonsful of 
salt, four of ground bhck pepper, three table spoonsful of 
ground mustard, half a table spoonful of allspice, half a 
spoonful of cloves, six red peppers, ground fine — simmer the 
whole slowly, with a pint of vinegar, three or four hours^ 
then strain it through a sieve, bottle and cork' it tight. The 
catsup should be made in a tin utensil, and the later in tho 
season it is ma^ the less liable it will be to spoil. 

59. Mushroom Catsup. 

Put a layer of fresh mushrooms in a deep dish, sprinkle a 
little salt over them, then put in another layer of fresh mush . 
rooms, and salt, and so on till you get in all the mushrooms

Procure the walnuts by the last of JunoT— keep ^hem in «u 
and water for a week, then bruisiB them, and turn boiling vin> 
.rgar on them. Let them remain covered with vinegar fol 
several days, stirring them up each day — ^then boil them a 
quaiter of an hour with a little more vinegar, strain it through 
a thick cloth, so that none of the coarse particles of the wal 
nuts will go through — season the vinegar highly with cloves 
allspice, pepper and salt. Boil the whole a few minutes, then 
bottle and cork it tight. Keep it in a cool place. 

61. Curry Powder. 

Mix an ounce of ginger, one of mustard, one of pepper 
three of coriander seed, the same quantity of turmeric, a 
quarter of an ounce of cayenne pepper, half an ounce ot 
cardamums, and the same of cummin seed and cinnamon. 
Pound the whole fine, sifl, and keep it in a bottle corked tight. 

62. Essence of Celery. 

Steep an ounce of celery seed in half a pint of brandy, or 
vinegar. A few drops of this will give a fine flavor to soupsi 
and sauce for fowls. 

63. Soup Herb Spirit. 

Those who like a vstriety of herbs in soup, will find it very 
convenient to have the following mixture. Tsike when in their 
prime, thyme, sweet marjoram, sweet basil, and summer sa. 
vory. When thoroughly dried, pound and sifl them. Steep 
them in brandy for a fortnight, the spirit will then be fit 
for use. 

64. Plain Veal Soup. 

A leg of veal, after enough has been cut off for cutlets 
makes a soup nearly as good as caif 's head. Boil it with 
a cup two thirds full of rice, a pound and a half of pork— • 
season it with salt, pepper, and sweet herbs, if you like. A 
little celery boiled in it gives the soup a fine flavor. Some 
people Hke onions, carrots, and parsely boiled in it. If you 
wish for balls in the soup, chop veaJl and a little raw salt porK

ftae, mix it with a few bread crumbs, and a couple of egg8« 
Boa jon it with salt and pepper — add a little curry powder if 
you like, do it up into small balls, and boil them in the soup. 
The veal should be taken up before the soup is seasoned. 
Just before the soup is taken up, put in a couple of slices of 
toast, cut into small pieces. Lf you do not like your soup 
fat, let the liquor remain till the day after you have boiled 
the meat, and skim off the fat before heating the liquor* Tho 
^louldcr of Teal makes a good soup. 

65. Mock TurOcy or Calf's Head Soup. 

Boil the head until perfectly tender — then take it out, strain 
the liquor, and set it away until the next day — ^then skim off 
the fat, cut up the meat, together with the lights, and put it 
into the liquor, put it on the fire, and season it with salt, pep- 
per, cloves, and mace— add onions and sweet herbs, if you 
like — stew it gently for half an hour. Just before you take 
)t up, add half a pint of white wine. For the balls, chop lean 
real fine, with a little salt pork, add the brains, and season 
it with salt, pepper, cloves, mace, sweet herbs or curry powder, 
make it up into balls about the size of half an egg, boil part 
in the soup, and fry the remainder, and put them in a dish by 
themselves 

66. Beef or Blade Soup. 

The shank of beef is the best part for soup— cold roast 
Deef bones, and beef steak, make very good soup. Boil the 
shank four or five hours in water, enough to cover it. Half 
an hour before the soup is put on the table, take up the meat, 
thicken the soup with scorched fiour, mixed with cold water, 
season it with salt, pepper, cloves, mace,* a little walnut, oi 
tomato catsup improves it, put in sweet herbs' or herb spirit 
if you like. Some cooks boil onions in the soup, but as they 
are very disagreeable to many persons, it is better to boil 
and serve them up in a dish by thems'^lves. Make farce 
meat balls of part of the beef and pork» season them with 
mace, cloves, pepper, and salt, and -boil them in the \>up 
Sfleeu minutes.

remain till the day after the poultry has been boiled in it, then 
skim off the fat, set it where it will boil. If there was not any 
rice boiled with the meat, put in half a tea cup full, when the 
liquor boils, or slice up a few potatoes and put in — season it 
with salt and pepper, sweet herbs, and a little celery boiled 
in it improves it. Toast bread or crackers, and put them ir 
the soup when you take it up. 

68. Oyster Soup. 

Separate the oysters from the liquor, to each quart of the 
liquor, put a pint of milk or water, set it on the fire with the 
oysters. Mix a heaping table spoonful of flour with^ little 
water, and stir it into the liquor as soon as it boils'. Season 
it with salt, pepper, and a little walnut, or butternut vinegar, 
if you have it, if not, common vinegar may be substituted. 
Put in a small lump of butter, and turn it as soon as it boils 
up again on to buttered toast, cut into small pieces 

69. Pea Soup. 

If you make your soup of dry peas, soak them over night, 
in a warm place, using a quart of water to each quart of the 
peas. Early the next morning boil them an hour. Boil 
with them a tea spoonful of saleratus, eight or ten minutes, 
then take them out of the water they were soaking in, put 
them into fresh water, with a pound of salt pork, and boil it 
till the peas are soft, which will be in the course of three or 
four hours. Green peas for* soup require no soaking, and 
boiling only long enough to have the pork get thoroughly 
cooked, which will be in the course of an hour. 

70. Portable Soup. 

Take beef or veal soup, and let it get perfectly cold, ihen 
skim off every particle of the grease. Set it on the fire, and 
let it boil till of a thick glutinous consistence. Care shoul i 
be taken that it does not bum. Season it highly with salt, 
pepper, cloves and mace — add a little wine or brandy, and 
Jien turn it on to earthen platters. It should not be more 
than a quarter of an inch in thickness. Let it remain un*i!

dry, put them in an earthen or tin vessel, having a layer (ri 
white naper between eacli jayer. These, if the directioni 
are strictly attended to, will keep good a long 'time. When- 
ever you wish to make a soup of them, nothing more is 
necessary, than to put a quart of water to one of the cakes. 
{|Dd heat it very hot. 

71. To Boil Eggs. 

They should be put into boiling water, and if you wish to 
have them soft, boil them only three minutes. If you wish 
to have them hard enough to cut in slices, boil them five 
minutes. Another way which is very nice, is to break the 
shells, and drop the eggs into a pan of scalding hot water, 
let it stand till the white has set, then put the pcui on a 
moderate fire, when the water boils up, the eggs are cooked 
sufficiently. Eggs look very prettily cooked in this way, the 
yelk being just visible throOgh the white* If you do not use 
the eggs for a garnish, serve them up with burnt butter 
See receipt fpr making, No. 42. 

72. Omelet. 

Beat the eggs to a froth, and to a dozen of eggs put three 
ounces of finely minced boiled ham, beef, or veal ; if the latter 
meat is used, add a little salt. Melt a quarter of a pound of 
butter, mix a little of it with the eggs— ^it should be just 
lukewarm. Set the remainder of the butter on the fire, in a 
frying or tin pan, when quite hot, turn in the eggs beaten to 
a froth, stir them until they begin to set. When brown on 
the under side, it is sufficiently cooked. The omelet should 
be cooked on a moderate fire, and in a pan small enough, to 
hove the omelet an inch thick. When you take them up, lay 
a i9at dish on them, then turn the pan upside down. 

73. Poached Eggs. 

Break the eggs into a pan, beat them to a froth, then put 
them into a buttered tin pan, set the pan on a few coals, put 
in a small lump of butter, a little salt, let them cook very 
Hlowly, stirring tliera constantly till they becoi le quite thickf 
then turn tliom on to buttered toast. 



M FISH. 

74, Directumsfor BroiUng, BoiUjig and Fryuig Fish. 

Fish for boiling or broiling are the best the day after tbej 
are caught. They should be cleaned when first caugh^ 
washed in cold water, and half a tea cup of salt sprinkled on 
. the inside of them. If they are to be broiled, sprinkle pep 
per on the inside of them — ^keep them in a v ool "place. When 
fish is broiled, the bars of the gridiron should be ruboed ovcT 
with a little butter, and the inside of the fish put towards tho 
fire, and not turned till the fish is nearly cooked through- 
then butter the skin side, and turn it over — ^fish should be 
broiled slowly. When fresh fish is to be boiled, it should ei- 
ther be laid on a fish strainer, or sewed up in a cloth — if not, 
It is very difficult to take it out of the pot without breaking- 
Put the fish into cold water, with the back bone down. To 
eight or ten pounds of fish, put half of a small tea cup of 
salt. Boil the fish until you can draw out one of the fins 
easily — ^most kinds of fish will boil sufficiently in the course 
of twenty or thirty minutes, some kinds will boil in less time- 
Some cooks do not put their fish into the water till it boils, 
but it is not a good plan, as the outside gets cooked too much, 
and breaks to pieces before the inside is sufficiently done, 
'^ish for frying, after being cleaned and washed, should be 
put into a cloth to have it absorb the moisture. They should 
be dried perfectly, and a little flour rubbed over them. No 
salt should be put on them, if you wish to have them brown 
well.' For five or six pounds of fish, fry three or four slices 
of salt pork — when brown, take them up, and if they do not 
make fat sufficient to fry the fish in, add a little lard. When 
the fish are fried enough, take them up, and for good plain 
gravy, mix two or three tea spoonsful of flour with a little 
water, and stir it ihto the fat the fish was fried in — put in a 
little butter, pepper, and salt, if you wish to have the gravy 
nch— add spices, catsup and wine — turn the gravy over the 
fish. Boiled fish should be served up with drawn butter, oi 
liver sauce, (see directions for making each, Nos. 41 and 51.) 
Fish, when put on the platter, should not be laid over each 
other if it can be avoided, as the steam from the under ones 
makes those on the top so moist, that* .hey will break to pieces 
'*••'*'• '^H* ;ea out. 



PISH. 80 

Gibat care and punctuality is necessalr f in cooking fish, 
if not done suHicientlyy or if done too much, they are not 
good. They should be eaten as soon as cooked. For a gar- 
nish to the fishy use parsely, a lemon, or eggs boiled hard* 
and cut in slices. 

75. Chowder. 

Fry three or four slices of pork till brown— cut each ol 
your fish into five or six slices, flour, and put a layer of them 
in your pork fat, sprinkle on pepper and a little sait — adc 
cloves, mace, and sliced onions if you like — ^lay on several 
bits of your fried pork, and crackers previously soaked sofi 
in cold water. This process repeat till you get in all the fish, 
then turn on water enough to just cover them — ^put on a heat- 
ed bake pan lid. When the fish have stewed about twenty 
minutes, take them up, and mix a couple of tea spoonsful of 
flour with a little water, and stir it into the gravy, also, a lit- 
tle butter and pepper. Half a pint of white wine, spices, and 
catsup, will improve it. Bass and cod make the best chow 
der — ^black fish and clams make tolerably good ones. The 
hard part of the clams should be cut ofl*, and thrown away. 

76. Stuffed and Baked Fish. 

Soak bread in cold water till soft — drain off" the water 
mash the bread fine, mix it with a table spoonful of melted 
butter, a little pepper and salt — a couple of raw eggs makes 
die dressing cut smoother — add spices if you like. Fill the 
fish with the dressing, sew it up, put a tea cup of water in 
your baKe pan, and a small piece of butter — ^lay in the fish, 
bake it from forty to fifty minutes. Fresh cod, bass, and 
shad, are suitable fish for baking. 

77. Codfish, 

Fresh cod is good boiled, fried, or made into a chowo^ 
It is too dry a fish to broil. Salt cod should be soaked m^ 
ukewarm water till the skin will come off* easily — ^then talc»i 
ap the fish, scrape off the skin, and put it in fresh water, and 
set it on a very moderate fire, where it will keep wann with- 
Dut boiling, as it hardens by boiling. It takes between thr&M 
and four hours to cook it soft- -serve it up with drav\-n butte/' 



86 

CSold salt codfish is nice minced iiiie, and mixed with masked 
potatoes, and warmed up, with just water enough to moisiter 
ity and considerable butter. It makes a nice dish for break 
tast, prepared in the following manner. Pull the fish intj 
small pieces, soak it an hour in warm water, then drain off 
the water, put a little milk and butter to it, stew it a few min« 
utes, and serve it up with sofl boiled eggs. 

78. Cod Sounds and Tongues. 

Soak them four or five hours in lukewarm water— then 
taKe them out of the water, scrape off the skin, cut them once 
m two, and stew them in a little milk. Ju£^ before they am 
taken up, stir in butter, and a little flour. 

79. HaMuU 

Is nice cut in slices, salted and peppered, and broiled or 
fried. The fins and thick part is good boiled. 

80. Stnped and Sea Bass. 
• Bass are good fried, boiled, broiled, or made into a chowd< r 

81. Black Fish 

kre the best boiled or fried — ^they will do to broil, but are 
not so good as cooked in any other way. 

82. Shad. 

Fresh shad are good baked or boiled, but better broiled. 
For broiling, they should have a good deal of salt and pep- 
per sprinkled on the inside of them, and remain several hours 
before broiling. The spawn and liver are good boiled or 
fried. Salt shad and mackerel, for broiling, should be soakeci 
ten or twelve hours in cold water. Saft shad, for boiling. 
Deed not be soaked only long enough to get off the scalea 
without you like them quite fresh — ^if so, turn boiling water on 
them, and let them soak in it an hour — then put them into 
fresh boiling water, and boil them twenty minutes. To pickle 
shad, mix one pound of sugar, a peck of rock salt, two quarts 
of blow^n salt, and a quarter of a pound of s^lt-petre. Allow 
this quantity to every twenty-five shad. Put a layer of the 
ofuiture at the botto/n of the keg, then a layer of cleanf d <«ha<i 



Ftsu* 87 

with Uv skin side down. Sprinkle on another layer of aai^ 
sugar, and sait-petre, and so on till you get in all tho snad. 
Lay a heavy weight on the shad^ to keep it under the brine. 
If the juice of the shad does not run out so as to form brine 
sufficient to cover them, in the course of a week, make a little 
brine, and turn on to them. 

83. Sturgeons. 

Sturgeons are gooa ooiiea or baked, but better fried. Be- 
fore baking it, boil it about fifteedf minutes, to extract the 
strong oily taste, and when baked, to eight or ten pounds of 
it put a quart of water into the pan, and bake it till tender. 
(See directions for baking fish, No. 74.) The part next to 
the tail is the best for baking or frying. Sturgeons are very 
nice, cooked in the following manner. Cut it in slices nearly 
an inch thick — fry a few slices of pork — ^when brown, take 
them up, and put in th^ sturgeon. When a good brown co- 
lor, take them up, and stir in a little flour and water, mixed 
smoothly together. Season the grary with salt, pepper, and 
catsup*— stir in a little butter, and wine if you like, then put 
back the sturgeon, and let it stew a few minutes in the gravy. 
While the sturgeon is cooking, make force meat balls of part 
of the sturgeon and salt pork — fry and use them as a garnish 
for the fish. 

84. Fish Cakes. 

Cold boiled fresh fish, or salt codfish, is nice minced fine, 
with potatoes, moistened with a little water, and a little butter 
put in, done up into cakes of the size of common biscuit, and 
fried brown in pork fat or butter. 

85. Fish Force Meat BaMs* 

Take a little uncooked fish, chop it fine, together with a 
jttle raw salt pork, mix it with one or two raw egfi'S, a few 
bread crumbs, and season the whole with pepper and spices, 
^dd a little ca;sup if you like — do them up into small ballf^ 
ind fry them till brown. 

86. Lobsters and Crabs. 

Piit them into boiling water, and boil them from half to

three quarten of an hcjr, according to their size. Boi Kali 
a tea cup of salt with every four pounds of the fish. When 
cold, crack the shell, and take out the meat, taking care tc 
extract the blue veins, and what is called the lady in the lob< 
ster, as they are very unhealthy. If the fish are not eaten 
cold, warm them up with a little water, vint^gar, salt, peppsFf 
and butter. The following way of dressing lobsters .ock^ 
very prettily. Pick out the spawn and red chord, mash them 
fine, rub them through a sieve, put in a little butter and salt. 
Cut the lobsters into squares, and warm it, togetlicr with the 
spawn, over a moderate fire. When hot, take it up, and gar- 
nish it with "parsely. The chord and spawn are a handsome 
garnish for any kind of fish. 

87. Scollops. 

Are nice boiled, and then fried, or boiled and pickled, in 
the same manner as oysters. Take them out of the shells — 
when boilf»d, pick out the hearts, and throw the rest away 
as the heart is the only part that is healthy to eat. Dip the 
hearts in flour, and frj' them in lard till brown. The hearts 
are good stewed, with a little water, butter, salt, and pepper. 

88. Eels. 

Eels, if very large, are best split open, cut into short pieces, 
and seasoned with salt and pepper, and broiled several hours 
after they have been salted. They are good cut into small 
strips, and laid in a deep dish, with bits of salt pork, season- 
ed with salt and pepper, and covered with pounded rusked 
bread, then baked half an hour. Small eels are the best fded . 

89. Trout. 

Trout are good boiled, broiled, or fried — ^they are also good 
dcewed a few minutes, with bits of salt pork, butter, and a 
little wator. Trout, as well as all other kinds of fresh water 
fish, are apt to have an earthy taste — ^to remove it, soak thcna 
in salt and water a few minutes, after they are cleaned. 

90. Clams. 

Wash and put them in a pot, with just water enough to pre.* 
vent the shells burning at the bottom of the pot. Heat them 



FIBS. 39 

ffli the shells open — lake the clams out of them, and warm 
tfaein with a little of the clam liquor, a little salt, butter, and 
pepper. Toast a slice or two of bread, soak it in the clam 
liquor, lay it in a deep dish, and turn the clams on to it. For 
ciam pancakes, mix flour and milk together to form a tliick 
batter — some cooks use the clam liquor, but it does not make 
die pancakes as light as the milk. To each pint of the fnilk, 
put a couple of eggs, and a few clams-^they are good taken 
out of the shells without stewing, and chopped fine, or stew- 
ed, and put into the cakes whole. Very large long clams are 
good taken out of the shells without stewing, and broiled. 

91. Stewed Oysters. 

Strain the oyster liquor, rinse the bits of shells off the oys- 
* ters, then turn the liquor back on to the oysters, and put them 
m a stew pan — set them where they will boil up, then turn 
them on to buttered toast — salt, pepper, and butter them to 
your taste. Some cooks add a little walnut catsup, or vine- 
gar. The oysters should not be cooked till just before the3f 
are to be eaten. 

92. To Fry Oysters. 

Take those that are large, dip them in beaten eggs, and 
then in flour, or fine bread crumbs — ^fry them in lard, till of 
a light brown. They are a nice garnish for fish. They will 
Keep good for several months if fried when first caught, salt- 
ed and peppered, then put into a bottle, and corked tight. 
Whenever they are to be eaten, warm them in a little water. 

93. Oyster Pancakes. 

Mix equal quantities of milk and oyster juice together. To 
a pint of the liquor when mixed, put a pint of wheat flour, a 
ew oysters, a couple of eggs, and a little salt. Drop by 
h>3 la^ spoonful into hot lard. 

94. Ch/ster Pie. 

Line a deep pie plate with pie crust — ^ftll it with dry pieces 
of bread, cover it over with puff paste— bake it till a light 
Drown, either m a quick oven or bake pan. Have the oys- 
dprs just stewed bv the time the crust is done — take off tlie

eatsup improves the pie^ but is not essential-^HSovep it with th» 
orust. 

95. Scolloped Oysters. 

Poun^ msked bread or crackers fine-^butter scodop shc«.s 
dr tinst sprinkle on the bread crumbs, then put in a layer oi 
oysters, a smatl lump of butter, pepper, salt, and a little of 
the oyster juice — then put on another layer of crumbs and 
oysters, and so on till the shells are filled, having a layer of 
' rumbs at the top Bake them till a light brown. 

96. Potatoes. 

The best way to cook Irish potatoes, is to pare and put 
them in a pot, with just boiling water enough to prevent theii 
burning, and a little salt. Cover them tight, and let them 
stew till you can stick a fork through them easily, if any 
water remains in the pot, turn it off, put the pot where it will 
Keep moderately warm, and let the potatoes steam a few rao* 
ments longer. The easiest way to cook them, is to put them 
in boiling water, with the skins on, and boiled constantly till 
done. They will not be mealy if they lie soaking in the 
water without boiling. They are more mealy to peel them 
as soon as tendf^^" and then put back in the pot without 
any water, and set in a warm place where they will steam, 
with the lid of the pot off. Old and poor potatoes are best 
ooiled till soft, then peeled and mashed fine, with a little salt, 
butter, and very litde milk put in — ^then put into a dish, smooth- 
ed over with a knife, a little flour sprinkled over it, and 
put whei^ it will brown. Cold mashed, or whole boiled pota- 
toes, &ie nice cut in sHces, and fried with just butter at iard 
enough to prevent their burning. When brown on both 
aides, taice them up, salt and butter them. Most poUtoes 
will boil in the course of half an liour-— new ones wiH boil in 
time. Sweet potatoes are better baked than boiled. 



97. Potato Snow Balls. 

Take the white mealy kind of potatoes-^are theni. and 
fittt them into just boiling water enough to cover them ^4idd 



VBOKTABLBS. 41 

a little salt When boiled tender, drain off the water, and 
let them steam till tliey break to pieces — ^take them up, put 
»wo or three at a time compactly together in a strong cloth} 
and press tiiem tight, in the form of a ball — then lay them in 
your potatoe dish carefully, so as not to fall apart 

98. TimUps. 

White turnips require about as much boiling as potatoes 
When tender, take them up, peel and mash them — season 
Ihem with a little salt and butter. Yellow turnips require 
about two hours boiling — if very large, split them in iwo 
The tops of white turnips make a good salad. 

99. Beets. 

m 

Beets should not be cut or scraped before they are ooiled, 
OT the juice will run out, and make them insipid. In sum- 
mer, tiiey will boil in an hour — ^in winter, it takes three hours 
to boil them tender. The tops in summer are good boiled 
for greens. Boiled beets cut in slices, and put in cold spiced 
vinegar for several days, are very nice. 

100. Parsntps and Carrots, 

Wash them, and split them in two— lay them in a stew 
pan, with the flat side down, turn on boiling water enough to 
cover them — ^boil them till tender, then take them up, and 
take off the skin, and butter them. Many cooks boil them 
whole, but it is not a good plan, as the outside gets done too 
much, before the inside is cooked sufficiently. Cold boilea 
Darsnips are good cut in slices, and fried brown. 

101. Onions* 

Peel and put them in boiling milk, (water will do, bat it in 
not as good*) When boiled tender, take them up, salt them 
^md turn a little melted butter over them. 

102. Artichokes, 

Scrape and put them in boiling water, with a table spoon, 
ful^of salt to a couple of dozen. When boiled tender, (which 
wili be in abou* two hours,) t^ke them c^ salt and battel 
««cn one 



42 VEOSTABLES. 



103. Squashes, 

Snmmer squashes, if very young, may be boiled vvholc— if 
not, they should be pared, quartered, and the seeds taken out. 
When boiled very tender, take them up, put them in a strong 
cloth, and press out all the water — ^mash them, sail auJ but 
ter them to your taste. The nedc part of the winter squasb 
is the best. Cut it in narrow strips, take off the rind, and 
Doil the squash in salt and water till tender — ^then drain off 
the water, and let the pumpkin steam over a moderate fire 
for ten or twelve minutes. It is good not mashed — if mash- 
ed, add a little butter, 

104. Cabbage and Cauliflowers. 

Trim off the loose leaves of the cabbage, cut Iikv ^ftalky 
in quarters, to the heart of the cabbage — ^boil it an hour. If 
not boiled with corned beef, put a little salt in the water in 
which they are boiled. White cauliflowers are the best. 
Take off the outside leaves, cut the stalk close to the leaves, 
let them lie in salt and cold water for half an hour before 
boiling them — ^boil them fifteen or twentj' minutes, according 
to their size. Milk and water is the best to boil them in, 
but clear water does very well. Put a little salt in the pot 
in which they are boiled. 

105. Asparagus. 

Cut the white part of the stalks off, and throw it away- 
cut the lower part of the. stalks in thin slices if tough, and 
boil them eight or ten minutes before the upper part is put inl 
Lay the remainder compactly together, tie it carefully in 
small bundles, and boil it from fifteen to twenty minutes, ac 
cording to its age. Boil a little salt with them, and a q^jar« 
ter of a tea spoonful of saleratus, to two or three quarts of 
water, to preserve their fresh green color. Just before youi 
Lsparagus is done, toast a slice of bread, moisten it with p 
jitle of the asparagus liquor, lay it in your asparegus dish, 
and butter it — ^thcn take up the asparagus carefully with a 
skimmer, and lay it on the toast, take off the string salt 
It. and turn a little melted butter ovei the whole. 



VQOBTABLBS. 43 



106. PcM. 

Peas should bo put into boiling water, with salt and sat* 
aratus, in the proportion of a quarter of a tea spoonful of 
saleratus to half a peck of peas. Boil them from fifteen to 
diirty minutes, according to their age and kind. When boil- 
ed tender, take them out of the water with a skimmer, salt and 
butter them to the taste. Peas to be good should be fresh 
gathered, «and not shelled till just before they are cooked. 

107. Sweet Com, 

Corn is much sweeter to be boiled on the cob. If made 
into sucatosh, cut it from the cobs, and boil it with Lima beans, 
and a few slices of salt pork. It requires boiling from fif- 
teen to thirty minutes, according to its age. 

108. To cook various kinds of Beans. 

• French beans should have the strings taken ofF — ^if old, the 
edges should be cut off, and the beans cut through the middle. 
Boil them with a little salt, from twenty-five to forty minutes, 
according to their age. A little saleratus boiled with them 
preserves their green color, and makes them more healthy. 
Salt and butter them when taken up. Lima beans can be 
kept the year round, by being perfectly dried when fresh gath- 
ered in the pods, or being put without drying into a keg, with 
a layer of salt to each layer of beans, having a layer of salt 
at the bottom of the keg. Cover them tight, and keep them 
in a cool place. Whenever you wish to cook them, soak 
them over night, in cold water — shell and boil them, with a 
little saleratus. White beans for baking, should be picked 
3ver carefully to get out the colored and bad ones. Wash 
and soak them over night in a pot, set where the} will keep 
ukewarm. There should be about three quarts of water to 
three pints of the beans. The next morning set them where 
thoy will boil, with a tea spoonful of saleratus. When they 
have boiled four or five minutes, take them up with a skim- 
mer. Put them in a baking pot. Gash a pound of pork, 
and put it down in the pot, so as to have the beans cover all 
but the upper surface — ^turn in ojld water till you can ju<rt see 



/ 



44 ▼BGXTASLES. 

ft at the top. Thoy will bake in a hot oven» in the couivr of 
three hours-— but they are belter to remain in if five oi six 
hours. Becuis are good prepare^l in the same manner nz for 
Daking, and stewed several hours without baking. 

109. Grfeiw. 

White mustard, spinach, water cresses, dandelions, anu ihe 
leaves and roots of very smaK beets, are the best greens. 
Boil them with a little salt and saleratus in the water, ii no^ 
fresh and plump, soak them in salt and water half an houi 
before cooking them. When they are boiled enough, the> 
will sink to the bottom of the pot. 

110. Salads. 

To be in perfection, salads should be fresh gathered, ano 
kept in cold water for an hour before they are put on the ta 
ble. The water should be drained from them^ and if yow 
have not any salad oil, melt a little butter and put it in a 
separate dish — ^if turned over the salad, it will not be crispy 

111. Cueumhers* 

To be healthy they should not be picked longer than a day 
before they are to be eaten. They should be kept in cold 
water, and fifteen or twenty minutes before they are to be 
eaten, pare and slice them into fresh cold water, to take ou* 
the slimy matter. Just before they are put on the table, drain 
off the water. Put them in a deep dish ; sprinkle on a good 
deal of salt and pepper— cover them with vinegar. Cucum- 
bers are thought by many people to be very unhealthy, but 
if properly prepared, they will not be found to be any more 
unwholesome than most other summer vegetables. 

112. T( stew Mushrooms. 

Cut off the lower part of the stem, as it is apt to have an 
earthy taste. Peel and put them in a saucepan, with just wa^ 
ter enough at the bottom, to prevent their burning to the pan. 
Put in a little salt, and shake them occasionally while stew 
tng, to prevent their buming. When they have stewed quite 
lender, put in a little butter and pepper — ad.l spices and wine 



VBOSTABLBS. 49 

if jon like. They shodd stew Tery slowly tiH tenoer, «iid 
not be seasoned tiQ jus^ before they are taken up. Serf% 
them up on buttenid toast. 

118. EggPkmt 

BoL thsm a few moments to extiact the bitter taste— then 
oit them in thick slices ; sprinkle a ilttle salt between each 
slice. Let them lie half an hour — then fry thera till brown 
Id lard. 

114. Cekriac, 

This is an excellent vegetable, but is little known. The 
stalks of it can hardly be distinguished from celery, and it is 
much easier cultivated. The roots are nice, boiled tender, 
cut in thin slices, and put in soup or meat pies ; or cooked in 
the following manner, and eaten with meat. Scrape and cut 
them in slices. Boil them till very tender — ^then drain off the 
water. Sprinkle a little salt over them— turn in milk enough 
to cover them. When they have stewed about four or fiv« 
minutes, turn them into a dish, and add a little butter. 

115. Salsify or Vegetable Oyster, 

The best way to cook it is to parboil it, (after scraping off 
the outside,) then cut it in slices, dip it into a beaten egg, and 
fine bread crumbs, and fry it in lard. It is very good boiled, 
then stewed a few minutes in milk, with a little butter and 
salt. Another way which is very good, is to make a bat- 
ter of wheat fiour, milk and eggs ; cut the Salsify in thin 
slices, (after having been boiled tender,) put them into the 
batter with a little salt ; drop this mixture into hot fat, by the 
(arge spoonfuL When a light brown, they are cooked suf- 
ficiently. 

116 Tomatoes. 

If very ripe wiU skin easily ; if not, pour scalding water 
m them, and let them remain in it four or five minutes. Peel 
A2id put them in a stew pan, with a table spoonful of water, 
if not very juicy ; if so, no water will be required. Put in a 
htt!e salt, and stew them for half an hour; then turn thera 
'nto a deep dish with buttsred toast. Another way of cook- 
'Dg them, wltich is considered very nice by epicures, is to put 



40 PICELB8. 

inem in a deep dish, with fine bread crumbs, crackem pouod 
ed fine, a ayer of each alternately ; put small bits of butten 
a little salt, and pepper on each layer — some cooks add a lit- 
tle nutmeg and sugar. Have a layer of bread crumbs ou 
the top. Bake it three quarters of an hour. 

117. Gumbo. 

Take an equal quantity of young tender ocra chopped fine 
and ripe tomatoes skinned, an onion cut into slices, a smaA 
lump of butter, a little salt and pepper. Put the whole in a 
stew pan, with a table spoonful of water, and stew it till tender. 

118. Southern manner of Boiling Rice. 

Pick over th^ rice, rinse it in cold water a number of times, 
to get it perfectly clean ; drain off the water, then put it in a 
pot of boiling water, with a little salt. Allow as much as a 
quart of water to a tea-cup of rice, as it absorbs the water 
very much while boiling. Boil it seventeen minutes ; then 
turn the water off very close ; set the pot over a few coals, 
and let it steam fifteen minutes with the lid of the pot off. 
The beauty of rice boiled in this way, is, that each kernel 
stands out by itself, while it is quite tender. Great care is 
necessary to be used in the time of boiling and steaming it, 
as a few moments variation in the time, makes a great deal 
of difference in the looks of it. The water should boil 
hard when the rice is put in, and not suffered to stop boil- 
ing, till turned off to have the rice steamed. The water that 
the rice is boiled in, makes good starch for muslin, if boiled 
a few minutes by itself. 

118. Biredzcns for PickUng. . 

Vinegar for pickling should be good, but not of the sharp- 
est kind. Brass utensils should be used for picKling. They 
should be thoroughly cleaned before using, and no vinegar 
should be allowed to cool in them, as the rust formed by so 
doing is very poisonoq^. Boil alum and salt in the vinegar 
in the proportion of half a tea cup of salt, and a table spon* 
ful of alum, to three gallons of vinegar. Stone and woo<len 
vessels are the only kinds of utensils that are good to keep 
pickles in. Vessels that have had any grease in will not do 
for pickles, as no washing vill kill the. grease that the pot has 



PiCKLBS. 47 

absorbed, K.\ idnds of pdckles should be stirred up occa« 
aionally. Il there is any sofl ones among them, they should 
be taken ou^, the vinegar scalded, and turned back while 
hot — if very weak, throw it away, and use fresh vinegar. 
Whenever auy sciim rises, the vinegar needs scalding. If 
you do not wish to have all your pickles spiced, it is a good 
plar to keep a stone pot of spiced vinegar by itself, and put 
in a £e%/ of your pickles a short time before they are to be 
eaten. 

^ 120. To Pickle Peppers. 

Procure those that are fresh and green. , If you do not like 
them very iiery, cut a small slit in them, and take thb seeds 
out carefully with a small knife, so as not to mangle the pep- 
per. Soak them in salt and water, eight or nine days, chat er- 
.ng the water each day. Keep them in a warm place. If 
you like them stuffed, chop white cabbage fine, season it 
highly with cloves, cinnamon, mace, and fill the peppers with 
it — add nasturtions if you like — sew them up carefully, and 
put them in cold spiced vinegar. Tomatoes when very small 
and green are good pickled with the peppers. 

121. Mangoes. 

Procure muskmelons as late in the season as possible— 
if pickled early, they are not apt to keep well. Cut a small 
piece from the side that lies upon the ground while growing, 
take out the seeds, and if the citron or nutmeg melons are 
used for mangoes, the rough part should be scraped off. The 
long common muskmelons make the best mangoes. Soak 
the melons in salt and water, three or four days ; then take 
them out of the water ; sprinkle on the inside of the melons, 
powdered cloves, pepper, nutmeg ; fill them with small strips 
of horseradish, cinnamon, and small string beans. Flag 
root, nasturtions, and radish tops, are also nice to fill them 
with. Fill the crevices with American mustard seed. Pul 
09ck the pieces of melon that were cut off, and bind the me- 
,on up tight with white cotton clotn, sew it on. Lay the me- 
ions in a stone jar, with the part that the covers are on, up. 
Put into vinegar for the mangoes, alum, salt and pepper, 
noms, ir the same proportion as for cucumbers — heat it scald* 



46 nCKLKS. 

ing hot, then turn it oh to the melons. Barberries or radiA 
tops pickled in bunches, are a pretty garnish for mangoes 
The barberries preserve their natural color best by being fiisi 
dried. Whenever you wish to use them, turn hoiling vinegni 
on them, and let them lie in it several hours to swell out* 

122. To Pickle Butternuts and Walnuts. 

The nuts for pickling should be gathered as early as July 
jnless the season is very backward. When a pin will go 
through them easily, they are young enough to pickle. Soak 
*hem in salt and water a week — ^then drain it off. Rub them 
with a cloth, to get off the roughness. To a gallon of vine, 
gar put a tea-cup of salt, a table-spoonful of powdered cloves 
and mace, mixed together, half an ounce of allspice, and 
peppercorns. Boil the vinegar and spices, and turn it while 
hot on to the nuts. In the course of a week, scald the vin- 
egar, and turn it back on them while hot. They will be fit 
JO eat in the course of a fortnight. 

123. Peaches and Apricots. 

Take those of a full growth, but perfectly green, put them 
m salt and water, strong enough to bear up an egg. When 
they have been in a week, take them out, and wipe them 
carefully with a soft cloth. Lay them in a pickle jar. Put 
to a gallon of vinegar half an ounce of cloves, the same 
quantity of peppercorns, sliced ginger and mustard seed-* 
add salt, and boil the vinegar — ^then turn it on to the peaches 
scalding hot. Turn the vinegar from them several times* 
Heat it scalding hot, and turn it back while hot. 

124. To Pickle Cabbages and CauJifiawers. 

Purple cabbages are the best for pilskling. Pull off the 
^oose leaves, quarter the cabbages, put them in a keg, aiMi 
4pnnkle a great deal of salt, on each one— let them remain 
five or six days. To a gallon of vinegar put an ounce of 
mace, one of peppercorns and cinnamon, (cloves and allspioe 
improve the taste of the cabbages, but they turn it a dark 
color.) Heat the vinegar scalding hot, put in a little alum, 
Qtti turn it while hot on to the cabbages— the salt should 
■XMnain that was sprinkled on the cabbages. Turn the vino 



F1CKLI8. 40 

gar from the cabbages six or seven tirq^s— heat it scalding 
hotf and turn it back while hot, to make them tender. Cauli- 
fkwers are pickted in the same manner. Cauliflowers cut 
into buncnes, and pickled with 'jeet roots sliced, look very 
prettfiy. 

125. East India Pickle. 

Chop cabbage fine, leaving out the stalks, together with 
Ou^ee or four onions, a root of horseradish, and a coupie 
of green peppers to each cabbage. Soak the whole in sail 
end water three or four days. Spice some vinegar very 
strong with mace, cloves, allspice and cinnamon. Heat it 
scalding hot — add alum and salt, and turn it on to the cab 
bage, onions and pepper, which should previously have all the 
brine drained from them. This pickle will be fit to eat in 
the course of three or four weeks. 

126. French Beans and Radish Pods. 

Gather them while quite small and tender. Keep them in 
;3alt and water, till you get through collecting them — chang- 
flig the water as oflen as once in four or five days. Then 
scald them with hot salt and water, let them lie in it till cool, 
then turn on hot vinegar spiced with peppercorns, mace and 
aUapice. The radish top, if pickled in small bunches, are a 
pretty garnish for other pickles. 

127. Nasturtion. 

Take them when small and green— put them in salt and 
water— change the water once in three days. When you 
tiave done collecting the nasturtions, turn off the brine, and 
pour on scalding hot vinegar. 

128. Samphire. 

Procure samphire that is fresh and green — ^let it lay in aak 
*br three days— then take it out, and for a peck of samphire 
a^k^ft a gallon of vinegar with a couf^e of dozen of pepper 
eorns — add half a tea-cup of salt — ^heat the vinegar ad !-sg 
hot, and turn it on to the samphire while hot — cover it close. 
In the course of ten days, turn the vinegar from the sam- 
phiret heat it scalding hot, and turn it bcick.

129. Onums 

Peel and boL them in milk and water ten minutes To 
% gallon of vinegar put half an ounce of cii namon and macok 
a quarter of an ounce of cloves, a small tea-cup of salt, and 
half an ounce of alum. Heat the vinegar, together with tho 
jpices, scalding hot, and turn it on to the onions, which sho.rd 
previously have the water and milk drained from diem. 
Cover them tight till cold. 

130. Artichokes. 

Soak the artichokes in salt and water, for several daysij 
then drain and rub them till you get all the skin off. Turn 
boiling vinegar on them, with salt,'eflum, and peppercorns in 
it, in the same proportion as for cucumbers. Let them re- 
'Tiain a week, then turn off the vinegar, scald it, and turn )i 
hack while hot on to the artichokes. Continue to turn boil 
lAg vinegar on to the artichokes till thoroughly pickled. 

131. Cucumbers.; 

Gather those that are small and greeii; and of a quick 
growth. Turn boiling water -^n them^'as soon as picked. 
£«pt them remain in it four or five hours, then put them in 
cold vinegar, with alum and salt, in the proportion of a table 
' spoonf'il of the former and a tea cup/ of the, latter, to evei^ 
gallon of vinegar. When you have done collecting the cu- 
cumbp.rs for pickling, turn the vinegar from the cucumbers, 
scald and akim it till clear, then put in the pickles, let them 
scald without boiling, for a few minutes ; then turn them 
while hot ipto the vessel you intend to keep them in. A few 
peppers, or peT)percorns, improve the taste of the cucumbers. 
Cucumbers to be brittle need scalding several times. If the 
Tinegar is wea3^ it should be thrown away, and fresh put to 
thfc cucumbers^ with more alum and salt. Another method 
of pickling cucumbers, which is good, is to put them in salt 
I ad water, as you pick them— changing the salt and watei 
mce in three or four davs. When you have done collectinij 
r'our cucumbers for pirkliD^. take them out of the salt and 
jvater, turn on*scald>ng h^t v'n«fE»* w\i\ plura ««^t an/* p<jp«

Pat them in strong brine — ^keep them in a warm plao6» 
When they turn yefiow, drain ofT the brine, and turn hot vine- 
gar on them. Let them remain in it till they turn greeni 
keeping them in a warm place. Then turn off the vinegar 
—add fresh scalding hot vinegar, spiced with mace, allspice, 
and peppercorns — add alum and salt, in the same proportion 
as for cucumbers. 

133. To Pickle Oysters. 

Take the oysters from the liquor, strain and boil it. Rinse 
the oysters, if there are any bits of the shells attached to 
them. Put them into the liquor while boiling. Boil them 
one minute, then take them out of it,, and to the liquor put a 
few peppercorns, cloves, and a blade 6r two of mace — add a 
little salt, and the samo quantity of vinegar as oyster juice. 
Let the whole boil fifteen minutes, then turn it on to the oys- 
ters. If you wish to keep the oysters for a number of weeks, 
bottle and cork them tight as soon as cold. 

134. To Pickle Mushrooms, 

Peel and stew them, with, just water enough to prevent 
their sticking at the bottom, of the pan. Shake them occa- 
sionally, to prevent their burning. When tender, take them 
up, and put them in scalding hot vinegar, spiced with mace, 
cloves, and peppercorns — add a little salt. Bottle and cork 
them tight, if you wish to keep them long.-' 

135. Wheat Bread. 

. For six common sized loaves of bread, take three pints of 
Dolling water, and mix it with five or six quarts of flour. 
When thoroughly mixed, add three pints of coid water. Stir 
t till the whole of the dough is of the same temperature. 
When lukewarm, stir in half £( pint of family yeast, (if brew 
0rs' yeast is used, a less quantity will answer,) a table-spoon- 
ful of salt, knead in flour till stiff enough lo mould up, and 
free from lumps. The more the bread is kneaded, the hette? 
'tt will be. Cover i1 over with a thick cloth, and if the WAa 



52 BSKAD. 

ther is cold, set iS near a fire. To aflcertain when it haa 
risen, cut it through the middle with a knife — ^if full of smai. 
holes like a sponge, it is sufficiently light for baking Ii 
should be baked as soon as light. If your bread should gel 
sour before you are ready to bake it, dissolve two or mora 
tca-spoonsful of saleratus (according to the acidity of it) in 
a tea-cup of milk or water, strain it on to the dough, ^ork i! 
m well — ^then cut off enough for a loaf of bread — ^mould it. 
Ui> well, slash it on both sides, to prevent its cracking wheii 
baked — ^put it in a buttered tin-pan. The bread should stand 
ten or twelve minutes in the pans before baking it. If you 
like your bread baked a good deal, let it stand in the oven an 
hour and a half. When the wheat is grown, it makes better 
bread to wet the flour entirely with boiling water. It should 
remain till cool before working in the yeast. Some cooks 
have an idea that it kills the life of the flour to scald it, but 
it is a mistaken idea — it' is sweeter for it, and will keep 
good much longer. Bread made in this way is nearly as 
good as that which is wet with milk. Care must be taker 
not to put the yeast in when the dough is hot, as it will scak^ 
it, and prevents its rising. Most ovens require heating an 
hour and a half for bread. A brisk fire should be kept up 
and the doors of the room should be kept shut, if the weather 
is cold. Pine and ash, mixed together, or birch- wood, is the 
best for heating an oven. To ascertain if your oven is of 
the right temperature, when cleaned, throw in a little flour ; 
if it browns in the course of a minute, it is sufficiently hot ; 
if it turns black directly, wait several minutes, before putting 
in the things that are to be baked. If the oven does not 
bake well, set in a furnace of live coals. 

136. Sponge Bread. 

For four oaves of bread, take three quarts of wheat flour 
and the same quantity of boiling water — ^mix them well tc« 
gether. Let it remain till lukewarm, then add a tea-cup full 
of family, or half a tea-cup of distillery yeast. Set it in 9 
warm place to rise. When light, knead in flour till stid 
enough to mould up, then let it stand HL risen f^p^hu before 
moulding it up. 



137, Rye Pread. 

^ei up rye flour with luke.wr\rni milk, (waU^^ will do to 
vvw/' it with, but it will not make the bread so good.) Put ir 
thts same proportion of yeast hp for wheat bread. For foui 
or five loaves of bread, put ip a couple of tea-spoonsful of 
HsAU A couple oi table-spoonsful of melted butter makes 
«/ie crust more tender. It should not be kneaded as stiff as 
(vheat bread, or it will be hard when baked. When lighti 
take it out into pans, withoiU moulding it up — ^let it remain 
in them about twenty minutfvi, before baking. 

138. Brown Bread. 

Brown bread is made by scalding Indian meal, and stir- 
ring icto it, when lukewarnH about the same quantity of rye 
flour as Indian meal—- add yee^t and salt in the same oropor- 
tion as for other kinds of bn^. Bake it between two and 
three hours. 

139. Indmn Bread. 

Mix Indian meal with cold water, stir it into boiling wateiy 
et it boil half an Taour — stir in a little salt, take it from the 
Are, let it remain till lukewarm, then stir in yeast and Indian 
meal,, to render it of the consistency of unbaked ryp. dough. 
When light, take it out into buttered pans, let it renv«m a fuw 
minutes, then bake it two hours aad a half. 

140. Potato Bread. 

Boil the potatoes very sofl, then peel and mash them fine. 
Put in salt, and very little butter — ^then rub them with the 
flour — ^wet the flour with lukewarm water — then work »n trie 
veast, and flour till stiff to mould up. h will rise quicker 
than common wheat bread, and should be baked as soon as 
risen, as it turns sour very soon. The pot9toes that the 
bread is made of should be mealy, and mixed with the fkmx 
o the proportion of one-third of potatoes to two-thinUi of 
Bour. 

141 jRice Bread. 

Boil a pint of ri^ till aad — ^then mix it with a ooupV oC

f4 rsAsr. 

quarts of rice or wheat flour. When cool, add half a tea 
cup of yeasty a b'ttle salt, and milk to render it of the con 
sistency of rye bread. When light, baKe it in small butter 
ed pans. 

142| French Rolls 

Turn a quart of lukewarm milk on to a quart of floinr* 
Melt a couple of ounces of butter, and put to the milk ano 
flour, together with a couple of eggs, and a tea-spoonful of 
«ialt. When cool, stir in half a tea-cup of yeast, and flour to 
make it stiff enough to mould up. Put it in a warm place. 
When light, do it up into small * rolls — ^lay the rolls on flat 
buttered tins — ^let them remain twenty minutes before baking. 

143. Yeast. 

Boil a small handful of hops in a couple of quarts of wa- 
ter. When the strength is obtained from them, strain the 
liquor — ^put it back on the fire — ^take a little of the liquor, 
and mix smoothly with three heaping table-spoonsful of wheat 
flour — stii it into the liquor when it boils. Let it boil five 
or six minutes— take.it from the fire. When lukewarm, stir 
in a tea-cup of yeast^ — ^keep it in a warm place till risen. 
When of a frothy appearance, it is sufiiciently light. Add a 
table-spoonful of salt, turn it into a jar, and cover it tight. 
Some people keep yeast in bottles, but they are apt to burst 
— some use jugs, but they cannot be cleaned so easily as jars. 
Whenever your yeast gets sour, the jar should be thoroughly 
cleaned before fresh is put in — ^if not cleaned, it will spoil the 
fresh yeast. Yeast made in this manner will keep good a fort- 
night in warm weather ; in cold weather longer. If your yeast 
appears to be a little changed, add a little saleratus to it before 
you mix it with your bread. If it does not foam well, when 
put in, it is too stale to use. Milk yeast makes sweeter bread 
than any other kind of yeast, but it will not keep good long, 
[t is very nice to make biscuit of. Take naif the quantity 
r)f mi k you need for your biscuit — set it in a warm phce, 
with a little flour, and a tea-spoonful of salt. When light, 
mix it with the rest of the miik, and use it directly for the 
biscuit. It takes a pint of this yeast for five or six loaves 
of bread. Another method of making yeast, which is very 



BISCUIT. 55 

good, is to take about half a pound of your bread dough, when 
risen, and roll it out thin» and dry it. When you wish to 
make bread, put a quart of lukewarm milk to it, set it near 
the fire to rise — ^when light, scald the flour, and let it be till 
lukewarm — ^then add the yeast and salt. This will raise the 
dread in the course of an hour. The dough will need a lit- 
tle fresh hop liquor put to it, in the course of three or four 
times baking. Potato yeast makes very nice bread, but the 

{'east does not keep good as long as when made without them* 
t is made in the following manner : boil a couple of good- 
sized potatoes sofl — ^peel and rub them through a sieve — ^put 
to it a couple of table-spoonsful of wheat flour, and a quart 
of hot hop tea — ^when lukewarm, stir in half a tea-cup of 
yeast — when light, put in a couple of tea-spoonsful of saltt 
put it in your yeast-jar, and cover it up tight. 

144. Yeast Cikes, 

Stir into a pint of good lively yeast a table-spoonful of 
salt, and rye or wheat flour to make a thick batter. When 
risen, stir in Indian meal till of the right consistency to roll 
out. When risen again, roll them out very thin, cut them 
kito cakes with a tumbler, and dry them in the shade in clear 
windy weather. Care must be taken to keep them from the 
sun, or they will ferment. When perfectly dry, tie them up 
in a bag, and keep them in a cool dry place. To raise four 
or five loaves of bread, take one of these cakes and put to 
it a little lukewarm milk or water. When dissolved, stir in 
a couple of table-spoonsful of flour, set it near the lire— 
When light, use it for your dough. Yeast cakes will keep 
^ood five or six months. They are very convenient to use 
a\ summer, as common yeast is so apt to ferment. 

145. Butter Biscuit. 

Melt a tea-cup of butter — mix it with two-thirds of a pint 
a milk, (if you have not any milk, water may be substituted, 
i)ut the biscuit will not be as nice.) Put in a tea-spoonful of 
uart, haif a tea-cup of yeast, (milk yeast is the best, see di. 
lectionfl for making it) — stir in flour till it is stiff enough to 
moijld up, A cnuple of eggs improve tbe biscuit, but are

flat tins that hate been buttered. Let them remain half oa 
hour before they are baked. 

146. Butter-milk BiscuiL 

DisdolVe a couple of tea-spoonsful of saleratus in a tea* 
cup of sonr milk — mix it with a pint of butter-milk, and s 
eouple of tea-spoonsful of salt. Stir in flour until stiff 
enough to mould up. Mould it up into small cakes, and bake 
them immediately. 

147. Hard Biscuit. 

Weigh out four pounds of flour, and rub three pounds and 
a half of it with four ounces of butter, four beaten eggs, and 
a couple of tea-spoonsful of salt. Moisten it with milk, 
pound it out thin with a roUing-pin, sprinkle a little of the re- 
served flour over it lightly — roll it up and pound it out again, 
sprinkle on more of the flour — this operation continue to 
repeat till you get in all the reserved flour — ^then roll it out 
thin, cut it into cakes with a tumbler, lay them on flat but- 
^«red tins^ cover them with a damp cloth, to prevent their 
drying. Bake them in a quick oven. 

148. Saleratus BisadL 

Put a couple of tea-spoonsful of saleratus in a pint of sour 
milk* If you have not any sour milk, put a table-spoonful 
o( vinegar to a pint of sweet milk, set it in a warm place— 
as soon as it curdles, mix it with the saleratus — put in a cou« 
pie of table-spoonfuls of melted butter, and flour to make 
them sufficiently stifl* to roll out. Mould them up into amal 
biscuit, and bake them immediately. 

149. Potato Biscuit. 

Boil mealy potatoes very soft, peel and mash them. Ti 
ibur good-sized potatoes, put a {nece of butter, of the size of 
a hen's egg, a tea-spoonful of salt. When the butter has 
melted, put in half a pint of cold milk. If the milk cools 
the potatoes, put in a quarter of a pint of yeast, and flour to make 
them of the right consistency to mould up. Set them in tn

table-fl^poonful of brewers' yeast, (the latter is the best ;) add 
flour till it is a very stiff batter. When light, drop this miz« 
lure by the large spoonful on to flat, buttered tins, several 
inches apart. Let them remain a few minutes before baking. 
Bake them in a quick oven till they ave a light brown. 

151. Crackers, 

Rub six ounces of butter with two pounds of flour — di». 
•oive a couple of tea-spoonsful <^ ^aleratus in a wine glass 
of milk, and strain it on to the fiour — add a tea-spoonful of 
salt, and milk enough to enable yon to roll it out. Beat it 
with a rolling-pin for half an hoiu*^ pounding it out thin-7- 
cut it into cakes with a tumbler — bake them about fifteen 
minutes, then take them from the oven. When the rest of 
your things are baked sufficiently, take them out, set in the 
crackers, and let them remain till b«ked hard and crispy. 

152. Cream Cakes, 

Mix half a pint of thick cream with the same quantity of 
milk, four eggs, and fiour to render them just stiff enough to 
drop on buttered tins. They should be dropped by the large 
spoonful several inches apart, and haHfM in a quick oven. 

153. Crumpets, 

Take three tea-cups of raised dough and work into it, with 
the hand, half a tea-cup of melted butter, three eggs, ana

to make a thick batter. Beat four eggs, (when it Is coo4») 
and put in, together with a tea-spoonful of salt. Drop thift 
mixture by the large spoonful into hot fat. 

^ 156. Buckwheat Cakes, 

Mix a quart of buckwheat flour with a pint of Xikewarm 
milk, (water will do, but is not as good,) and a tea-cup of 
yeast — set it in a warm place to rise. When light, (which 
will be in the course of eight or ten hours if family yeast is 
used, if brewers' yeast is used, they will rise much quicker,) 
add a tea-spoonful of salt — if sour, the same quantity of sal- 
eratus, dissolved in a little milk, and strained. If they are 
too thick, thin them with cold milk or water. Fry them in 
just fat enough to prevent their sticking to the frying pan. 

157. Economy Cakes, 

Rusked bread, or that which is old and sour, can be made 
into nice cakes. The bread should be cut into small pieces, 
and soaked in cold water till v<'.ry soft. Then drain off the 
water, mash the bread fine — ^to three pints of the bread pulp 
put a couple of beaten eggs, three or four table-spoonsful of 
flour, and a little salt— dissolve a tea-s]x>onful of saieratus to 
a tea-cup of milk, strain it, then stir it into the oread — add 
more milk till it is of the right consistency to fry. The bat- 
ter should be rather thicker than ^!iat of buckwheat cakes, 
and cooked in the same manner. Another way of making 
them, which is very good, is to mix half a pint of wheat flour 
with enough cold milk or water to render it a thick natter 
and a couple of table-spoonsful of yeapt When lignt, mis

Stir into a quart of sour or butter-milk a couple of tea* 
ipoonsful of saleratus, a little salt, and sifted Indian meal to 
render it a thick batter — a little cream improves the cake- 
bake it in deep cake pans about an hour. When sour milk 
cannot be procured, boil sweet milk, and turn it on to the In- 
dian meal — ^when cool, put in three beaten eggs to a quart 
of tlie meal — add salt to the taste. 

160. Indian Slap Jacks, 

Scald a quart of Indian meal — when lukewarm, turn, stur 
in half a pint of flour, half a tea-cup of yeast, and a little 
Bait. When light, fry them in just fat enough to prevent 
their sticking to the frying pan. Another method of making 
them, which is very nice, is to turn boiling milk or water on 
to the Indian meal, in the proportion of a quart of the former 
to a pint of the latter — stir in three table-spoonsful of flouv 
three eggs well beaten, and a couple of tea-spoonsful of salt. 

161. Journey or Johnny Cakes. 

Scald a quart of sifled Indian meal with sufficient water to 
make it a very thick batter. Stir in two or three tea-spoons- 
fii of salt — mould it with the hand into small cakes. In 
Ofcier to mould them up, it will be necessary to rub a good 
ds^ of flour on the hands, to prevent their sticking. Fry 
thysi in nearly fat enough to cover them. When brown on 
the under side, they should be turned. It takes about twenty 
minutes to cook them. When cooked, split and butter them.

turn in the mixture, and bake the muffins till a light brown. 

164. Raised Flour Waffies. 

Stir into a quart of flour sufficient lukewarm milk to make 
a thick batter. The milk should be stirred in gradually, so 
as to have it free from lumps. Put in a table-spoonful of 
melted butter, a couple of beaten eggs, a tea-spoonsful of salt, 
and half a tea-cup of yeast. When risen, fill your waffie- 
irons with the batter, bake them on a hot bed of coals. When 
they have been on the fire between two and three minutes, 
turn the waffle-irons over — when brown on both sides, they 
are sufficiently baked. The waffle-irons should be well 
gre^ised with lard, and very hot, before each one is put in. 
llie waffles should be buttered as soon, as cooked. Serve 
them up with powdered white sugar and cinnamon. 

165. Quick Waffles.

167. Bice Wafers. 

Melt a quarter of a pound of butter, and mix it with a 
pound of rice flour, a tea->spoonful of salt, and a wine glass 
ol' wine. Beat four eggs, and stir in, together with just cold 
milk enough to enable you to roll them oat easily. They 
should be rolled out as thin as possible, cut with a wine glass 
i«ito cakes, and baked in a moderate oven, on buttered flat tins. 

168. Rules to be observed in making nice Cake. 

Cake, to be good, must be made of nice materials. The 
butter, eggs, and flour, shoul(^ not be stale, and the sugar 
should be of a light color, and dry. Brown sugar answers 
very well for most kinds of cake, if rolled free from lumps, 
and stirred to a cream with the butter. The flour should be 
sifled, and if 'damp, dried perfectly, otherwise it will make 
the cake heavy. The eggs should be beaten to a froth ; and 
the cake will be more delicate if the yelks and whites are 
beaten separately. Saleratus and soda should be perfectly 
dissolved, and strained before they are stirred into the cake. 
Raisins for cake should have the seeds taken out. Zante 
currants should be rinsed in several waters to cleanse them, 
rubbed in a dry cloth to get out the sticks, and then spread 
on platters, and dried perfectly, before they are put into the 
caka. Almonds should be blanched, which is done by turn- 
fafig boiling water on them, and letting them remain in it tiD 
the Akins will rub ofl* easily. . W4ien blanched, dry them, then 
pound iiem fine, with rosewater, to prevent their oiling. 
When i !S weather is cold, the materials for cake should be 
laXierately warmed, before mixing them together. All 
kinds of cake that are made without yeast are better for 
oelng stirred, till just before they are baked. Tlie butter 
and sugar should be stirred together til. white, then the eggSi

flour, and 8pice» added. Saleratus tuid cream should not bi| 
put in till just before the cake is baked— add the fruit last 
Butter the cake pans well. The cake will be less liable to 
burn if the pans are lined with white buttered paper. The 
cake should not be moved while baking if it can be avoidtd, 
as moving it is apt to make it heavy. The quicker moil 
idnds of cake are baked, the lighter and better they will be ; 
but tlie oven should not be of such a furious heat as to bum 
them. It is impossible to give any exact rules as to the time 
to be allowed for baking various kinds of cake, as so much 
depends on the heat of the oven. It should be narrowly 
watched while in the oven, and if it browns too fast, it should 
be covered with a thick paper. To ascertain when rich cake 
is sufficiently baked, stick a clean broom splinter through the 
thickest part of the loaf — ^if none of the cake adheres to the 
splinter, it is sufficiently baked. When cake that is baked 
on flat tins moves easily on them, it is sufficiently baked. 

169. Frosimgfor Cake. 

Allow for the white of one egg nine heaping tea-spoonsful 
of double refined sugar, and one of nice Poland starch. The 
sugar and starch should be pounded, and sifted through a very 
fine sievfe,. Beat the whites of eggs to a stiff froth, so that 
you can turn the plate upside down, without the eggs falling 
from it — ^then stir in the sugar gradually, with a wooden 
spoon — stir it ten or fifteen minutes without any cessation- 
then add a tea-spoonful of lemon juice, (vinegar will answer, 
but is not as nice) — put in sufficient rosewater to flavor it. 
If you wish to color it pink, stir in a few grains of cochineal 
powder, or rose pink — ^if you wish to have it of a blue tinge, 
add a little of what is called the powder blue* Lay the 
frosting on the cake with a knife, soon, a^er it is taken from 
the oven — smooth it over, and let it rem^n in a cool place 
till hard. To frost a common sized loaf of cake, allow the 
white of one egg, and half ot anotner.

Melt a tea-cup of butter — ^mix it with a pint of molasses, a 
table-spoonful of ginger, a pint of flour, and a couple of beat- 
en eggs. Presh lemon peel, cut into small strips, improves 
it. Dissolve a couple of tea-spoonsful of saleratus in half a 
pint of milk, and stir it into the cake. Add flour to render it 
of the consistency of unbaked pound cake. Bake it in deep

Take it from ihe fire, take out the bean, or lemon peel — ^wheo 
perfectly cold, put it in an ice cream form — ^if one cannot be 
procured, a milk kettle, with a tight cover, may be substituted. 
Set the form into the centre of a tub that is large enough to 
leave a space of five inches from the form to the outside of 
the tub. Fill the space round the form with alternate layers 
of finely cracked ice and rock salt, having a layer of ice 
last, and the whole should be just as high as the form. Care 
should be taken to keep the salt from the cream. The tub 
should be covered with a woollen cloth while the cream is 
freezing, and the form should be constantly shaken. If you 
wish to shape the cream, turn it into moulds as soon as it 
freezes, set them in the tub, let them remain till just befon* 
they are to be eaten, then dip them in warm water, and tab* 
them out instantly, and turn them into dessert dishes. 

287. Pastry. 

For a good common pie-crust allow half a pound of shorts 
ening to a pound of flour. If liked quite short, allow three- 
quarters of a pound of shortening to a pound of the flour. 
Pie crust looks the nicest made entirely of lard, but it does 
not taste so good as it does to have some butter used in ma- 
King it. In winter, beef shortening, mixed with butter, makef 
good plain pie crust. Rub half of the shortening with two- 
thirds of the flour — to each pound of flour put a tea-spoonflil 
of sah. When the shortening is thoroughly mixed with the 
flour, add just sufRcient cold water to render it moist enough 
to roll out easily. Divide the crust into two equal portions 
—lay one of them one side for the upper crust, take the 
other, roll it out quite thin, flouring your rolling-board and 
pin, so that the crust will not stick to them, and line your pie 
p'ates, which should be previously buttered — ^fiU your platas. 
with your fruit, then roll out the upper ciust as thin as noe- 
dfaye, spread on the reserved shortening, sprinkle ovor the 



31 

flour, roll it upy and cut it into as imny pieces as you have 
pies to cover. Roll each one out about half an inch thick* 
and cover the pies — ^trim the edges off neatly with a kniie, 
and press the crust down, round the edge of the plate, with a 
jagging iron, so that the juices of the fruit may not run out 
while baking. Pastry, to be nice, should be baked in a quick 
oven. In cold weather it is necessary to warm the sh\irten« 
ing before using it for pie crust, but it must not be melted, or 
tne crust will not be flaky. 

238. Pujf Past€, or Cairfectioner*s Pastry, 

Weigh out a pound and a quarter of sifted flour, and a 
pound of butter. Rub about one-third of the butter with two- 
thirds of the flour, a tea-spoonful of salt. When the butter 
Is thoroughly mixed with the flour, add one beaten egg, and 
cold water to moisten it sufficiently to roll out. Sprinkle 
part of the reserved flour on a board, cut the butter into small 
pieces, and roll them out as thin as possible. In order to do 
so, it will be necessary to rub a great deal of the flour on the 
nioulding-board and rolling-pin. Lay the butter, as fast as 
rolled out, on to a floured plate, each piece by itself — ^roll out 
the pastry as thin as it can be rolled, cover it with the rolled 
butter, sprinkle on part of the reserved flour, and roll the 
crust up. Continue to roll out the crust, and put on the re- 
served butter and flour, till ^e whole is used. Roll it OMt 
lightly, about half an inch thick, for the upper crust, or rim 
to your pies — ^plain pie crust should be used for the under 
crust to the pies. Pufl* pastry, to be nice, should be baked in 
a quick oven till of a light brown color. If it browns before 
the fruit in the pie is sufficiently baked, cover it with thick 
paper. 

289. Apple Pie. 

When apples are very small and green, they are nice stew- 
ua whole, with the skins on, and strained when soft, and 
Qfwoetened. Pare, quarter, and take out the cores of the ap- 
ples, when of a large size. If they are not ripe, stew them 
with just water enough to prevent their burning. When soft, 
sweeten and season them to the taste. When apples are 
npc, they make better pies not to be stewed before baking. 



B2 

Pill yuur pie [riates, cover them with a thick crust, and bake 
them from' half to three-quarters of an hour. . When baked 
sufficiently, cut tlie upper crust through the centre, remove it 
carefully with a broad knife, put a piece of butter, of the srzo 
of a walnut, into a pie, sweeten it to your taste, and if the 
apples are not tart enough, squeeze in the juice of part of a 
lemon — ^flavor the pie with either nutmeg, rosewater, or grated 
lemon peel. App^s cut into quarters, without paring, and 
stewed soft in new cider and molasses, make good plain pies. 
The apples should be strained after stewing, and seasoned 
with cinnamon or nutmeg. If made quite sweet, it will keep 
good several months. Dried apples should have boiling wa. 
ter turned on to cover them, and stewed till very soft. If 
they are not tart enough, turn in sour cider, when they are 
partly stewed. A little orange peel stewed with the appk^s 
gives them a fine flavor. Season them, when soft, with sugai 
and nutmeg, and strain them if you like. 

240. Mmce Pie. 

The best kind of meat for mince pies is neat's tongue aid 
feet— the shank of beef makes very good pies. Boil the meat 
till perfectly tender — ^then take it up, clear it from the bonea 
and gristle, chop it fine enough to strain through a sieve, mix 
it with an equal weight of tart apples, chopped very fine. 
If the meat is not fat, put in a little suet, or melted butter. 
Moisten the whole with cider — sweeten it to the taste with 
sugar, and very little molasses — add mace, cinnamon, clov(^:4, 
and salt, to the taste. If you wish to make your pies rich, 
put in wine or brandy to the taste, and raisins, citron, and 
Zante currants. The grated rind and juice of lemons irn« 
prove the pie. Make the pies on shallow plates, with aper- 
tures in the upper crust, and bake them from half to three- 
quarters of an hour, according to the heat of the oven. Meaf 
prepared for pies in the following manner, will keep gcjcsd 
several months, if kept In a cool dry place : To a pound of 
finely chopped meat, a quarter of a pound of suet, put half 
an ounce of mace, one ounce of cinnamon, a quarter of an 
ounce of cloves, two tea-spoonsful of salt. Add if you like 
the following fruits : half a pound of seeded raisins, half q 
pound of 2Kante currants, a quarter of a pound of eitrofv 



PISS. 03 

Put in htk(f a pint of French brandy or winoy thr^ tabK 
spoonsful of molasses, and sugar sumcient to make it quite 
Bweet. Put the whole in a stone pot — cover it with a paper 
wet in brantty. When you wish to use any of it for pies, 
put to what meat you use an equal weight of apples, pared 
aind chopped fine. If not seasoned high enough, add moro 
spice and sugar. If the apples are not tart, put in lemon* 
^ce or sour cider. 

241. Rice Pie. 

To a quart of boiling water, put a small tea-cup of rice. 
Boil it till very soil, then take it from the fire, and add a quart 
of cold milk. Put in a tea-spoonful of salt, a grated nut- 
meg, five eggs beaten to a froth — add sugar to the taste, and 
strain it through a sieve. Bake it in deep pie plates, with an 
under crust and rim of pastry — add if you like a few raisins 

242. Peach Pie. 

Take mellow, juicy peaches — wash and put them in a deep 
pie plate, lined with pie crust. Sprinkle a thick layer of su- 
gar on each layer of peaches, put in about a table-spoonful 
of water, and sprinkle a little flour over the top— cover it with 
a thick crust, and bake the pie from fifty to sixty minutes 
Pies made in this manner are much better than with the 
stones taken out, as the prussic acid of the stone gives the 
pie a fine flavor. If the peaches are not mellow, they will 
require stewing before being made into a pie. Dried peach- 
es should be stewed sof^ and sweetened, before they are 
made into a pie — they do not require any spice. 

243. Tart Pie. 

Sour apples, cranberries, and peaches, all make ni/ie tarts. 
Btew, and strain them when soft. Peach tarts require a \iU 
tie lemon-juice, without they are sour. Grate in lemon peel, 
add brown sugar lo the taste. Put in each pie one beaten 
e^. to make it cut smooth. Bakie the pies on shallow plates, 
wifti an under crust and rim of pastry— ornament the pits 
with very small strips of pastry. When the crust is done 
remove the met from the oven.

244. RhuharhPies. 

Take toe tender stalks of the rhubarb, strip ofT the skin, 
and cut the stalks into thin slices. Line deep plates with pic 
crust, then put in the rhubarb, with a thick layer of sugar to 
each layer of rhubarb— a little grated lemon peel improves 
the pie. Cover the pies with a thick crust — press it down 
tight round the edge of the plate, and prick the crust with n 
fork, so that the crust will not burst while baking, and let out 
the juices of the pie. Rhubarb pies should be baked about 
an hour, in a slow oven — it will not do to bake them quick. 
Some cooks stew the rhubarb before making it into pies, but 
it is not 80 good as when used without stewing. 

245. Tomato Pie. 

Take green tomatoes, turn boili og water on them, and let 
them remain in it a few minutes — then strip off the skin, cu* 
the tomatoes in slices, and put them in deep pie plates. 
Sprinkle sugar over each layer, and a little ginger. Grated 
lemon peel, and the juice of a lemon, improve the pie. Covei 
the pies with a thick crust, and bake them slowly for about 
an hour. 

246. Lemon Pie. 

For one pie^ take a couple of good sized fresh lemons, 
squeeze out the juice, and mix it with half a pint of molasses, 
or sufficient sugar to make the juice sweet. Chop the peel 
fine, line a deep pie plate with your pastry, then sprinkle on 
a layer of your choppecUemon peel, turn in part of the mixea 
sugar or molasses, and juice, then cover the whole with pin 
crust, rolled very thin — ^put in another layer of peel, sweet 
ened juice, and crust, and so on, till all the lemon is used 
Cover the whole with a thick crust, and bake the pie~aboCl 
half an hour. 

247. Cherry and Blackberry Pie. 

Cherries and blackberries for pies should be ripe. Bak 
them in deep pie plates, sweeten them with sugar, and put in 
cloves or cinnamon to the taste. Bake them abo- it half ad 
hciir. 



PIES. db 

248. Grape Pie. 

Grapes make the best pies when very tender and greeo 
(f not very small, they should be stewed and strained, to get 
out the seeds, before they are made into pies^^weeten them 
to the taste when stewed. They do not require any spice. 
if made into a pie without stewing, put to each lay^r of grapes 
4 thick layer of sugar, and a table-spoonful of water. 

249. Currant and Gooseberry Pie. 

Currants and gooseberries are the best for pies when of a 
(bll growth, just before they begin to turn red — ^they are tol- 
orably good when ripe. Currants mixed with ripe raspber- 
ries or mulberries, make very nice pies. Green currants 
and gooseberries for pies are not apt to be sweet enough 
\i'ithout the sugar is scalded in before they are baked, as the 
juice of the currants is apt to run out while they are baking, 
and leave the fruit dry. Stew them on a moderate fire, with 
a tea-cup of water to a couple of quarts of currants — as soon 
as they begin to break, add the sugar, and let it scald in a 
few minutes. When baked without stewing, put to each lay- 
er of fruit a thick layer of sugar. There should be as much 
as a quarter of a pound of sugar to a pint of currants, to 
make them sufficiently sweet. Green currant pies are good 
sweetened with molasses and sugar mixed. 

250. Prune Pie. 

Prunes that are too dry to eat without stewing, can be 
made into good pies. Turn enough boiling water on the 
prunes to cover them, set them on a few coals, and let them 
remain till swelled out plump. If there is not water suffi. 
ci«;nt to make a nice syrup for the pies, add more, and season 
them with cinnamon or cloves. The juice and grated p(.*el 
cf a lemon gives them a fine flavor. Add sugar to the taste 
bLi bake them in deep pie plates. 

251. Pumpkin Pie. 

Halve the pumpkin, take out the seeds — rinse tlie pumpkin, 
and cut it into small strips — stew them, over a moderoto fire. 

in just sufficient water to prevent their burning, to the bottcm 

o 



S^ FI88. 

of the pot, When stewed soft, turn off the water, and let the 
pumpkin steam, over a slo^ fire, for fifteen or twenty minutes, 
taking care that it does not burn. Take it from the fire, and 
strain it, when cool, through a sieve. If you wish to have the 
pies very rich, put to a quart of the stewed pumpkin two q lartt 
of milk, and twelve eggs. If you like them plain, put to & 
quart of the pumpkin one quart of milk, and three eggs. The 
thicker the pie is of the pumpkin, the less will be the nutnbci 
of eggs required for them. One egg, with a table-spoonfa. 
of flour, will answer for a quart of the pumpkin, if very lit 
tie milk is used. Sweeten the pumpkin with sugar, znd very 
little molasses — ^the sugar and eggs should be txjaten togeth. 
er. Ginger, the grated rind of a lemon, or nutmeg, is good 
spice for the pies. Pumpkin pies require a very hot oven. 
The rim of the pies is apt to get burnt before the inside is 
baked sufficiently. On this iiccount, it is a good plan to heat 
ihe pumpkin scalding hot when prepared for pies, before 
turning it into the pie plates. The pies should be baked as 
soon as the plates are filled, or the under crust to the piej» 
will be clammy. The more the number of eggs in the pies, 
the less time will be required to bake them. If you have 
pumpkins that have begun to decay, or those that are frozen, 
they can be kept several months, in cold weather, by cutting 
the good part up, stewing it till soft, then stirring it, and add- 
ing sugar and molasses, to make it very sweet. Make it 
strong of ginger, then scald the seasoning in well. Keep it 
in a stone jar, in a cool place — whenever you wish to use 
any of it for pies, take out the quantity you wish, and put 
milk and eggs to it. 

252. Carrot Pie. 

Scrape the skin off from the carrots, boil them soft, and 
strain them through a sieve. To a pint of the strained pulp 
put three pints of milk, six beaten eggs, two table-spoonsfu 
of melted butter, the juice of half a lemon, and the grated 
rind of a whole one. Sweeten it to your taste, and bake it 
in deep pie plates without an upper crust.

254. Sioeet Marlborough Pie, 

Procure sweet mellow apples, pare and grate them. To 
a pint of the grated pulp put a pint of milk, a couple of eggs* 
two table-spoonsful of melted butter, the grated peel of a 
lemon, and half a wine glass of brandy. Sweeten it to tl^e 
taste with nice brown sugar. The eggs should be beaten to 
a froth, then the sugar stirred into them, and mixed with the 
rest of the ingredients. A little stewed pumpkin, mixed 
with the apples, improves the pie. Bake the pie in deep 
plates, without an upper crust. 

255. Marlborough Tarts, 

Take tart juicy apples— quarter them, and stew them till 
soft enough to rub through a sieve. To twelve table-spoons- 
ful of the strained apple, put twelve of sugar, the same quan- 
tity of wine, six table-spoonsful of melted butter, four beaten 
eggs, the juice and grated rind of a lemon, half a nutmeg, 
and half a pint of milk. Turn this, when the ingredients are 
well mixed together, into deep pie plates that are lined with 
pastry, and a rim of puff paste round the edge* Bake the 
tarts about half an hour. 

256. Cocoanut Pie. 

Cut oif the brown part of the cocoanut — ^grate the white 
part, and mix it with milk, and set it on the fire, and let it 
6oil slowly eight or ten minutes. To a pound of the grated 
cocoanut allow a quart of milk, eight egg;^ four table-spoons- 
Ail of- sifted white sugar, a glass of wine, a small cracker, 
pounded fine, two table-spoonsful of melted butter, and half 
a nutmeg. The eggs and sugar should be beaten together to 
a froth, then the wine stirred in. Put them into the milk and 
cocoanut, which should be first allowed to get quite cool— ^d 
the cracker and nutmeg — ^turn the whole into deep pie plates, 
nrith a lining and rim of puff paste. Bake them as soon as 
aimed into the plates.

half an inch thick, cut it into cakes with a tumbler — ^roll out 
the rest of the pastry, cut it into strips with a jagging iron, and 
lay the strips round those that are cut with a tumbler, so as 
to form a rim. Lay the pufis on buttered flat tins — ^bake 
them in a quick oven till a light brown, then fill them with any 
small preserved fruit you may happen to have. 

258. A Plain Custard Pie. 

Boil a quart of milk with half a dozen peach leaves or the 
rind of a lemon. When they have flavored the miik^ strain 
it, and set it where it will boil. Mix a table-spoonful of flour, 
smoothly, with a couple of table-spoonsful of milk, and stir 
it into the boiling milk. Let it boil a minute, stirring it con* 
stantly — ^take it from the fire, and when cool, put in three 
beaten eggs — sweeten it to the taste, turn it into deep pie 
plates, and bake the pies directly in a quick oven. 

259. A Rich Baked Custard. 

Beat seven eggs with three table-spoonsful of rolled sugar. 
When beaten to a f/joth, mix them with a quart of milk — fla- 
vor it with nutmeg. Turn it into cups, or else into deep pie 
plates, that have a lining and rim of pastry — bake them di- 
rectly, in a quick oven. To ascertain when the custards are 
sufficiently baked, stick a clean broom splinter into them — ^If 
none of the custard adheres to the splinter, it is sufficiently 
baked. 

260. Boiled Custards. 

Put your milk on the fire, and let it boil up— then remove 
it from the fire, and let it cool. Beat for each quart of th<i 
milk, if liked rich, the y^ilks and half the whites of six eggK

whites of the eggs a minute afler the iks have set, so as to 
oe thick. Season the custard with essence of lemon or rose- 
water— stir it till it becomes thick and lumpy, then turn it 
into cups. 

262. Cream Custards, 

Sweeten a pint of cream with powdered white sugar — set 
it on a few coals. When hot, stir in white wine until it cur- 
dles — add rosew&ter or essence of lemon to the taste, and turn 
it into cups. Another way of making them, which is very 
nice, is to mix a pint of cream with one of milk, five beaten 
eggs, a table-spoonful of flour, and three of sugar. Add nut- 
meg to the taste, and bake the custards in cups or pie plates. 
In a quick oven. 

263. Almond Custards. 

RIanch and pound fine, with a table-spoonful of rosewater, 
four ounces of almonds. Boil them four or five minutes in 
» quart of milk, with sufficient white sugar to sweeten tho 
milk. Take it from the fire, and when lukewarm, stir in tlie 
beaten yelks of eight, and the whites of four eggs. Set the 
whole en the fire, and stir it constantly until it thicken&^-thea 
take it up, stir it till partly cooled, and turn it into cups. If 
you wish to have the custards cool quick, set the cups into a 
pan of cctd water — as fast as it gets warm, change it. Just 
before the custards are to be eaten, beat the reserved whites 
of the eggs to a froth, and cover the top of the custards with 
thenu

264. Apple Custards. 

Take half a dozen tart mellow apples-— ^re and quaitra 
diem, and take out the cores. Put them in a pan, with half 
a tea-cup of water — set them on a few coals. Whec they 
begin to grow sofl, turn them into a pudding dish, sprinkio 
sugdr on them. Beat eight eggs with rolled brown sugar — 
mix them with three pints of milk, grate in half a nutmeg 
and turn the whole over the apples. Bake the custard be- 
tween twenty and iiijrty minutes. 

265. Dl tionsfor making Puddings. 

A hag that is usee or hoiling puddings, should be made of 
thick cotton cloth. Before the pudding is turned in, the bag 
should be dipped into water, wrung out, and the irside of it 
floured. When the pudding is turned in, tie the bag tight, 
leaving plenty of room for the pudding to swell out in. In- 
dian and flour puddings require a great deal of room. Put 
them in a pot of boiling water, with an old plate at the bot- 
tom of the pot, to keep the pudding bag from bticking to it. 
When the pudding has been in a ievf minutes, turn the bag 
over, or the pudding will settle, and be heavy. There should 
be water enough in the pot to cover the pudding, and it should 
not be allowed to stop boiling a minute — ^if so, the padding 
will not be nice. A tea-kettle of boiling water should be kept 
on the fire, to turn in as the water boils away. When the 
pudding is done, dip the bag into cold water for a minute — 
the pudding will then come out easily. When puddings are 
baked, the fruit should not be put in till the pudding has be- 
gun to thickei\, otherwise they will sink to the bottom of the 
pudding. 

266. Hasty Pudding. 

Wet sifted Indian meal with cold water, to make a thick 
tter. Stir it into a pot of boiling water gradually. Boil 
tt an hour, then stir in sifled Indian meal, by the handful, till 
it becomes quite thick, and so that the pudding stick may bo 
made to stand up in it. It should be stirred in very gradiv^i. 
ly, so tliat the pudding may not be lumpy. Add salt to tHo 
taste. Let it boil slowly, and stir it frequently, to keep it 



froz.. \^ .ViSikiig an the inside of the pot. If you do lot wish to 
fry ti^^s i^uiding, it will boil sufficiently in the cc urse of an 
hour and a Lalf. If it is to be fried, it will be necessary to 
iioil it an iiou.* longer ; and a little flour stirred in, just before 
h is taken ufv, will make it fry better. It must get perfectly 
iS )ld before it iu fried. When you wish to fry it, cut it la 
slices half an ktijh thick, flour them, and fry them brown io 
a little lard. 

267. Com Puddings. 

€h-ate sweet gro*rt 3orn — to three tea-cups of it, when gra-

^ass of wine, a little salt, and half a nutmeg, three or four 
table-spoonsful of sugar, two of melted butter. Beat eight 
eggs to a froth — mix them with three pints of milk, and turn 
them on to the rest of the ingredients. Let it remain till 
the crackers begin to soften, tnen bake it. 

269. Boiled l^ ""Jan Pudding. 

Stir enough sifted Indian meat into a quart of boiling milk 
or water, to make a very stiff bauer — ^then stir in a couple of 
table-spoonsful of flour, three of sugar or molasses, half a 
spoonful of ginger, or a couple of eea-spoonsful of cinnamon, 
and a couple of tea-spoonsful of bAlt Two or three eggs 
improve the pudding, but are not essential — some people like 
a little chopped snet in them. The pudding will boil, so as to 
be very good, in the course of three hours, but it is better for 
being boiled five or six hours. Son*e cooks boil them eight 
or nine hours — when boiled so long » it is necessary to boil 
ft em several hours the day before thry are to be eaten. 

270. Baked Indian PJtding. 

Boil a quart of milk, and turn it on to a pint of sifted In- 
dian meal. Stir it in well, so as to scald the meal^-^en

Tlie milk should be stirred gradually into the flour, so as u 
nave it mix free from kimps. Turn it on to tl e Indian neai 
— ^mix the whole well together. When the whole is just 
lukewarm, beat three eggs with three table-spoonsful of sugar 
— 4tir them into the pudding, together with two tea-spoonsful 
of salt, two of cinncmon, or a grated nutmeg, and a couple 
of table-spoonsful of melted butter, or suet chopped fine* 
Add, if you wish to have the pudding very rich, half a pound 
of raisins — ^they should not be put in till the pudding has 
' baked five or six minutes. If raisins are put in, an addition- 
al half pint of milk will be required, as they absorb a great 
deal of milk. A very good Indian pudding may be made 
without eggs, if half a pint more of meal is used, and no flour. 
it takes three hours to bake an Indian pudding without eggs 
— if it has eggs in, it will bake in much less time. 

271. Minute Pudding. 

Put a pint and a half of milk on the fire. Mix five large 
table-spoonsful of either wheat or rye flour, smoothly, with 
half a pint of milk, a tea-spoonful of salt, and half of a grated

milk. Let tlie whole boil for one minute, stirring it con- 
slantly — ^take it from the fire, let it get lukewarm, then add

spoonful of melted butter, and cold milk sufficient to make I 
a thick batter. Mix the whole well together, then turn it into 
a floured pudding bag — ^tie it up, so as to leave room for the 
pudding to swell — ^boil it an hour and a half, without any in- 
U3rmission. Serve up the pudding with rich sauce.

nutter, and a couple of tea-spoonsful of bait. Grate in half 
of a nutmeg — add, if you want the puddiug very rich, half a 
pound of raisins. They should not be pui into a baked pud- 
ding till it has been cookmg long enough to thicken, so that 
the raisins will not sink to the bottom of it. A pudding made 
in this manner is good either baked or boiled, it takes two 
hours to boil, and an hour and a quarter to bake it. When 
boiled, the bag should not be more than two-thirds full, as 
jflour puddings swell very much. It should be put iuto boil* 
ing water, and kept boiling constantly. If the water boils 
away, so as to leave any part of the bag uncovered, more 
boiling water should be added. When the pudding has iiu*l« 
ed eight or nine minutes, the bag should be turned over, othi^t 
wise the pudding will be heavy. Flour puddings should Xi^ 
eaten as soon as cooked, as they fall directly. Serve theai

six or eight minutes — ^then strain it, till clear, through a flan, 
nel bag. The bag should not be squeezed while the syrup is 
passing through it, or it will not be clear. Bottle, cork, and 
seal it tight. This syrup is very nice to flavor puddings and 
Dies. 

300. Blackberry Syrup, 

Procure nice, high vine blackberries, that are perfectly 
ripe — ^the low vine blackberries will not answer for syrup, as 
they do not possess the medicinal properties of the high vine 
blackberries. Set them on a moderate fire, and let them 
simmer till they break to pieces, then strain them through s 
flannel cloth — to each pint of juic« put a pound of white su- 
gar, half an ounce of cinnamon, powdered fine, a quarter of 
an ounce of finely powdered mace, and a couple of tea-^jpoons 
ful of powdered cloves. Boil the whole together fifteen min* 
utes — ^ain it, and when cool, add to each pint of syrup a 
wine glass of French brandy. Bottle, cork, and seal it- 
keep it in a cool place. This, mixed with cold water, in the

SWBBTKXEATS. 101 

molasises, eight pounds of water, one pound of powdired 
eharcoal. Boil the whole together twenty minutes, then strain 
it through a flannel bag. When lukewarm, put in the beaten 
whites of a couple of eggs, and put it on the fire. As soon 
as it boils, take it from the fire, and skim it till clear — then 
put it on the fire, and let it boil till it becomes a thick syrup 
—strain it for use. This syrup does very well to preserve 
fruit in for common use. 

303. To clarify Syrup for Sweetmeats. 

Put your sugar into the preserving kettle, turn in the quan- 
tity of cold water that you think will be sufficient to cover the 
fruit that is to be preserved in it. Beat the whites of eggs to 
a froth, allowing one white of an egg to three pounds of su* 
gar — ^mix the Whites of the eggs with the sugar and water, 
set it on a slow fire, and let the sugar dissolve, then stir the 
whole up well together, and set it where it will boil. As soon 
as it boils up well, take it from the fire, let it remain for 3 
minute, then take off the scum — set it back on the fire, and 
let it boil a minute, then take it off, and skim it again. This 
operation repeat till the syrup is clear — ^put in the fruit when 
the s)rrup is cold. The fruit should not be crowded while 
preserving, and if there is not syrup enough to cover the fruit, 
take it out of the syrup, and put in more water, and boil it 
with the syrup before putting back the fruit. 

304. Directions for making Sweetmeats. 

A pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, is sufficient to pre- 
serve most kiijds of fruit. Some kinds of fruit require more, 
and some will do with less, than an equal weight of sugar 
White sugar makes the most delicate sweetmeats — nice brown 
sugar cmswers very well for most kinds of fruit. The West 
India sugar-house syrup is better than sugar to prescr re fruit, 
^n account of its never fermenting. When brown sugar is 
jsed, clarify it, as in direction for clarifying syrup. No. 303, 
then put in the fruit. Nice white sugar does not need clari- 
fying. All kinds of firewproof ware wil do to preserve in, 
excepting iron ware. The fruit should not be crowded while 
preserving, and should boil gently The fruit should be turn- 
ed out of the preserving kettles as soon as done, and set away

for other purposes. Glass jara are the best for delicate sweet- 
mcatS) such as strawberries or cherries Preserves should 
be covered tight, and kept in a cool place. A paper wet in 
brandy, and laid over the sweetmeats, has a tendency to keep 
them from fermenting. They should be looked to frequently 
to see that they do not ferment. Whenever they do, the 
8yrup should be turned from them, scalded, and turned back 
on them while hot. 

305. To Preserve Quinces. 

, Quinces, if very ripe, are best preserved in the following 
manner : Pare and cut them in slices, an inch thick— take 
out the cores carefully, so as to have the slices in the form of 
a ring. Allow a pound of nice white sugar for each pound 
of the fruit— dissolve it in cold water, having a quart of the 
latter to a pound of sugar, then put in the sliced quinces, and 
let them soak in it ten or twelve hours. Put them in a pre- 
serving kettle, and put it on a moderate fire— cover them 
over, and let the quinces boil geutly — ^there should be more 
Jian enough syrup to cover the quinces. When a broom 
splinter will go through them easily, take them from the fire, 
and turn them out. In the course of a week, turn the syrup 
from them, and boil it down, so that there will be just enough 
to cover the fruit. Quinces preserved in this manner retain 
their natural flavor better than when preserved in any other 
manner, but they must be very ripe to preserve in this way, 
otherwise they will not be tender. When not very ripe,* pare 
and cut them either in rings or quarters, take out the cores, 
and boil the quinces in fair water, till they begin to grow 
tender — ^take them up, and strain the water in which thoy are 
boiled — ^put in either brown or white sugar— add a little coIJ 
water. When lukewarm, put in the whites of eggs, an J ^a« 
rify it — let it cool, then put in the quinces, and boil them 
slowly' for half an hour. Keep them covered over while 
boiling, if you wish to have them of a light Cx>lor. Turn 
them out into pots as soon as preserved, and set them away 
in a cool place. Look at them in the course • of a week, to 
«8e if they have /erracated — ^if so^ turn the syrup from thonir ,

UmI iU and tur:) it back while hot. The parings and cores 
of the quinces can be used for marmalade^ witn a few whole 
ones. Some people preserve the quinces with the cores in, 
hut the syrup will not look clear. The following is a cheap 
method of preserving quinces, and answers very well for 
common use : Pare, halve, and take out the cores of the 
quinces^ and boil the parings in new cider till soft. Strain 
die cider, and for five pounds of quinces put in a pound of 
brown sugar, a quart of molasses, the beaten white of an egg 
—clarify it, then put in the quinces. There should be rather 
more than enough cider to Cover the quinces, as it wastes a 
good deal while the quinces are boiling. The peel of an 
orange, cut in small pieces, and boiled with them, gives the 
quinces a fine flavor. 

300. Quince Marmalade, 

Wash and quarter the quinces, without paring them^put 
them on the fire, with just water enough to stew them in. 
When sort, rub them through a sieve, and put to each pound 
of the strained quinces a pound of brown sugar. Set it on a 
few coals, and let it stew slowly, stirring it constantly. Whec 
it has stewed an hour, take a little of it out, let it get cold — 
if it then cuts smooth, it is sufficiently stewed. 

307. Pears. 

Make a syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to each pound of the pears. If brown sugar is used for the 
syrup, clarify it, then put in the pears, and boil them till soft. 
A few slips of ginger, or powdered ginger, tied up in bags, 
and boiled with the pears, gives them a fine flavor. Choke 
and vergouleuse are the best pears for preserving. 

308. Pear Marmalade. 

Boil the pears with the skins on. When soft, rub them 
through a sieve, and put to each pound of pulp three-quartera 
jf a pound of brown^sugar. Stew it over a slow fire till It 
becomes a thick jelly. It should be stirred constantly. 

309. Peaches. 
Take juicy peaches — ^pare them, allow for each pound of 



104 8WEBTXJBATS. 

khouiy a pound of nice wliite sugar. Put just cold wate 
enough to the sugar to saturate it. WYu^n dissolve, stir il 
up weli9 and put in the peaches, without crowding them, and 
boil them slowly about twenty minutes.. A few peach meats 
blanched and preserved with the peaches, are ni(^ and aro 
quite ornamental to the peaches. These, as well as all c hei 
kinds of sweetmeats, should be turned out of the preserving 
kettle as soon as taken from the fire, and set away in a cool 
place. If allowed to remain near the fire, the syrup will not 
look clear. Cover them up tight — ^let them remain three or 
four days, then turn the syrup from them, scald it, and turn 
it back, while hot, on to the peaches. 

810. Peach Jam. 

Inferior peaches, and those that are not fully ripe, are best 
preserved in the following manner : Pare and halve them, and 
take out the stones — lay the peaches in a deep dish, and to 
each layer of peaches put a layer of brown sugar. Three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of the peaches, is 
sufficient. Let the peaches remain until the next day — ^then 
put them on a moderate fire, without any water, and let them 
stew slowly about twenty minutes. Peaches preserved in 
this way, are very nice for puffs. 

311. To Preserve Peaches in Brandy. 

Procure peaches that are mellow, but not dead ripe— draw 
a pin round the seam of the peaches, so as to pierce the skin 
■^^5over them with French brandy, and let them remain a 
week — ^then make a syrup, allowing three-quarters of a pound 
of brown sugar to a pound of the peaches. Clarify the syrupy 
then boil the peaches in it. When tender,Hake them out of 
the syrup, let it remain till cool, then mix it with the brandy, 
and turn the whole on to the peaches. 

812. ,To Preserve Rasphemes. 

Strain equal quantities of ripe currants and raspbemefik tn 
nrnke a syrup to preserve the raspbei ries in. Dissolve white 
sugar in the syrup, by a gentle heat, using a pound of suga* 
to each pound of syrup and raspberries. When the sugai 
has lissolvedf set the syrup where it wiL boil ^bout ten rain* 



SWSBTnBATSo 105 

atesy then put in the raspberries, and let the.^ woil five min- 
utes. In the cou.-se of four or five days, turn the syrup from 
the raspberries — ^boil it away, so that there will be just enough 
of it JQ cover the berries — ^turn it on them while hot Keep 
them in wide-mouthed bottles, corked and sealed up tights 
Preserved raspberries are very nice to flavor ice creams And 
Ckianc mange. 

313. Cherries. * 

Procure cherries that are not quite dead ripe — allow for 
each pound of cherries a pound of white sugar. Make a rich 
syrup of the sugar — ^when it boils, put in the cherries, with 
the stems on — let them boil till transparent. Keep them in 
glass jars, or wide-mouthed bottles^-cork and seal them tight. 
If you wish to preserve them without the stones, take those 
that are very ripe, take out the stones carefully, save the juice. 
Make a syrup of the juice, white sugar, and very little water, 
' en put in the cherries, and boil them to a thick consistency. 

314. Currants* 

Take the currants when ripe and in their prime — ^let them 
remain on the stalks, picking off the bad ones. Make a syrup 
of sugar, and very little water, allowing a pound of sugar to 
each pound of currants. Clarify it, then put in the currants, 
and let them boil a few minutes. In the course of a few days 
turn the syrup from them, scald it, and turn it back, while hot, 
on to the currants. Preserved currants, mixed with water, is 
an excellent drink in fevers. Dried currants are also good 
for the same purpose, if made into a tea. 

315. To Preserve Prunes. 

Pour boiling water on the prunes, and set them lyhere they 
Will keep hot, with a lemon, cut in small pieces. When 
surelled out to nearly the original size, put to each pound of 
the prunes half a pound of brown sugar, a stick of cinna- 
mon, or a tea-spoonful of powdered cloves, and if there is 
not sufficient water remaining to cover the prunes, aad more, 
and stew them in the syrup a quarter of an hour. Add, 
when taken from the fire, a wine glass of wine to everv three 
pounds of the prunes. 



AVd SWKETXEArS. 



816. Cranberries* 



For each peck of cranberries allow two pounds and a half 
of brown sugar, and half a pint of molasses. Make a syrup 
of tlie molasses, sugar, and ^ little water. When it boils, put 
in the cranberries, and let them boil till transparent. To 
make cranberry marmalade, boil the cranberries in ;«st water 
enough to prevent their burning. Strain them when soft^ 
and add to each pound a pound and a lialf of brown sugar. 
Stew it over a slow fire, stirring it constantly, till it becomes 
very tiiick w^lly. 

317. Crab Apples. 

Make a syrup, allowing the same weight of sugar as ap- 
ples. Let it get cool, then put in the apples, a few at once, 
so that they will not crowd, and break to pieces. Boil them 
till they begin to break, then take them out of the preserving 
kettle carefully. Boil the syrup in the course of three or 
four days, and turn it while hot on to the apples. This con- 
tinue to do at intervals of two or three days, till the apples 
appear to be thoroughly preserved. If you wish to make a 
marmalade of the apples, boil them in just water enough to 
keep them from burning — strain them when soft, and put to 
them an equal weight of brown sugar — stew them over a slow 
fire, stirring them constantly. When of a thick consistency, 
take a little of it out, and set it where it will get cold. If it 
then cuts snK)oth and clear, take the whole from the fire, and 
turn it into deep dishes. • 

318. Barberries. 

Take them when fully ripe, let them remain on the sterna. 
Make a rich syrup, allowing the same weight of suge^r as 
barberries. When clarified, set it where it will get luke- 
warm, then put in the barberries. Boil them till the syrup 
appears to h^y^ entered them. Barberries preserved with 
molasses, arid a ''..le orange peel and sugar, are very good 
for common use. Allow for each pound of barberries a quar- 
ter of a pound of sugar, half a pint of molasses, and the rind 
of half an orange. Make them into a syrup with a little 
water — ^boil it a quarter of an hour before putting in the bar 



SWEIfiTMBATS. 107 

erries, Preaerved barberries, iiixed with cold water, make 
'A very refreshing drink in fevers. 

319. Tomatoes. 

Take them whan quite small and green — ^m them in cold 
clarified syrup, with an orange, cut in slices, to every two 
pounds of the tomatoes. Simmer them gently, on a slow 
fire, two or three hours. There should be equal weights of 
sugar and tomatoes, and more than sufficient water to cover 
the tomatoes, used for the syrup. Another method of pre 
serving them, which is very nice, is to allow a couple of fresh 
lemons to three pounds of the tomaioes — ^pare thin the rind 
of the lemons, so as to get none of the white part, squeeze 
out the juice, mix them with cold water sufficient to cover the 
tomatoes, and put in a few peach leilVes, and powdered gin- 
ger, tied up in bags. Boil the whole together gently, for 
three-quarters of an hour — ^then take up the tomatoes, strain 
the liquor, and put to it a pound and a half of white sugar, 
for each pound of tomatoes. Put in tlie tomatoes, and boil 
them gently, till the syrup appears to have entered them. 
In the course of a week turn the syrup from them, heat it 
scalding hot, and turn it on to the tomatoes. Tomatoes pre- 
serv*»d in this manner appear like West Indian sweetmeats. 

320. To Preserve Apples. 

Apples for preserving should be tart and mellow — pare 
them, and take out the cores with a small knife." Allow for 
each pound three-quarters of a pound of sugar, a tea-spooir- 
ful of powdered ginger, tied in a bag, and sufficient water to 
cover the apples. Make the syrup, then take it from the fire, 
and put in the apples, when it is just lukewarm. Boil them 
till transparent, take them up — when partly cooled, put in a 
Jttle essence of lemon. Turn the syrup fVom tliem in the 
eourso of a week, boil it, and turn it back on the apples 
while hot. 

321. Cj/mtelines, or Mock Citron, 

Cut into small pieces, and scrape the rind of c)rnibeiine8— • 
dut them into strong salt and water — /el them remain in ii 
Ihme oavfl, 'vAar m &iV water l day, changing the water sev

oral times — soak them in alum water an hour — ^tie up oystp) 
shells in a cloth, and boil them with ttie cymbelines. Wheii 
the cymbelines are tender, take them up, and put them bacK 
into the alum wqrfor. Make the syrup for them, allowing q 
pound and a half of sugar to one of the cymbelines. When 
clarified, let it get cold — ^ihen rinse the cymbelines, and boil 
them three-quarters of an hour. When partly cooled, put in 
a little essence of lemon to flavor them. These are gocd' 
eaten like any other sweetmeats, or used instead of citron foi 
cake. 

322. Watermelon Rinds, 

Take the rind of a nice ripe watermelon — cut it into smal 
strips, and boil them, till they begin to grow tender, in water, 
with saleratus and peach leaves in it, in the proportion of a 
tea-spoonful of saleratus and a dozen peach leaves to a couple 
of quarts of water. Take the rinds out of the water, and 
soak them in alum water an hour. Make a syrup, allowing 
the same weight of sugar as rinds. When clarified and 
cooled, rinse the rinds, and put them in the syrup, together 
with powdered ginger, tied up in a small bag. Boil them till 
they are quite soft — when partly cooled, add a little essence 
of lemon. Turn the syrup from them in the course of two 
or three days, take out the bags of ginger, and boil the syrup 
till there is just suflicient of it to cover the rinds, and turn it 
on them while hot. 

323. Muskmelons, 

Procure muskmelons that are perfectly green, and of a quick 
growth, and as late in the season as possible. If preserved 
while the weather is very hot, they are apt to ferment. 
Scrape oflT the skin of the rind, being careful not to scrape 
any of the green part. Cut them through the middle, and take 
out the seeds — ^then cut them in rings, an inch in thickness- 
Soak them in salt and water a day, then in fai' water thre^ 
or four hours, changing the water several times. Soak them 
in alum water an hour — rinse and put them in fair water, 
with a handful of peach leaves to four or five .pounds of the 
melon, ana a table-spoonful of ginger, tied up in small pieces 
rf cloth. The peach leaves tura the melon a fintc ipreen 



SWBEinSATS. 100 

color. Boil the melons till they begin to grow tender, then 
put them in alum water, together with the ginger. Make a 
ifyrup of white sugar, and put in the melons and ginger, 
(which should be previously rinsed.) Boil them in the syrup 
B3 long as you can, without their breaking to pieces. In the 
course of a week turn the syrup from them, scald it, and 
turn it on to the melons. Add sufficient essence of lemon to 
flavor it, just before turning it on to the melons. Keep them 
covered tight, in a cool place, with a paper wet in brandy on 
them. 

324. Pine Apples. 

Take those that are ripe, and perfectly fresh — ^pare off the 
rind, and cut the apples in slices an inch thick. Powder the 
same weight of white sugar as you have pine apples — lay 
the pine apples in a deep dish, and sprinkle part of the pow- 
dered sugar between each layer of apples. Reserve about 
half of the sugar. Let the apples remain till the succeeding 
day — ^then turn the syrup from them, and mix it with the re- 
served sugar, and half a pint of water, for three or four pounds 
of pine apple. Boil the syrup, take it from the fire, and when 
30ol, put in the apples, simmer them gently till tender, let 
them remain in a deep dish for several days — ^they should be 
covered up tight, and kept in a cool place. Whenever there 
15 any appearance of fermentation, turn the syrup from them, 
Bcald it, and turn it back hot on to the pine apples. Keep 
them in glass or china jars, covered tight, and in a cool place# 

325. Pumpkin Chips, 

Take what quantity you choose of a good sweet pumpkin, 
(ihxs butter pumpkin makes the nicest sweetmeats.,) Halve 
the pumpkin, take out the seeds, and cut it into chips of the 
Fize of a dollar. For each pound of the pumpkin to be pre- 
eerved, allow a pound of fine white sugar, and a gill of lemon- 
juice. Put the chips in a deep dish, and sprinkle on each 
layer a layer of the sugar. Turn the lemon-juice over the 
whole. Let it remain a day— then boil the whole together, 
with half a pint of water to three pounds of the pumpkin, a 
(able-spoonful of powdered gkiger, tied up in bags, and tha 
pcci of the lemons, cut iix) small pifHses. When the pump^

110 JBLUSS. 

kin becomes tender, turn the whole into a preserve pot. In 
the course of a week, turn the syrup from the pumpkin^ boi. 
it to a rich syrup, and turn it back not. 

^26. Gages 

Allow equal weights of sugar and gages. Make a symp 
of white sugar, and just water enough to cover the plums 
Boil the plums slowly in the syrup ten minutes — ^turn thera 
into a dish, and let them remain four or five days, then bolt 
them again, till the syrup appears to have entered the plums. 
Put them in a china jar, and in the course of a week turn the 
syrup from them, scald it, and turn it over them hot. 

327. Strawberries. 

Procure Chili or field strawberries, and hull them. Take 
equal quantities of berries, and powdered white sugar— put a 
layer of each in a preserving pan, having a layer of straw- 
berries at the bottom. Let them remain an hour, then put in 
a gill of cold water, to prevent their burning to the bottom 
of the pan. Set them on a very moderate fire — when the 
juice runs freely, increase the fire, until they boil briskly. 
Let them boil half an hour, then turn them into a dish — ^when 
lukewarm, put them in wide-mouthed bottles, or small glass 
jars, cork smd seal them tight, and keep them in dry sand. 

328. Raspberry and Blackberry Jam, 

For each pound of berries, allow a pound of sugar. . Put 
a layer of each alternately in a preserving dish. Let thenr 
remain half an hour — ^then boil them slowly, stirring them 
frequently, to keep them from burning. When they have 
boiled half an hour, take a little up in a cup, and set it in a dish 
of cold water — ^if it appears of the consistency of thick jelly 
take the whole from the fire — if not, boil it till it becomes so 

329. Strawberry, Raspberry, and Blackberry Jelly, 

Jellies of these fruits are all made in the following manner; 
Take the berries when ripe, and in their prime, mash them, 
and let them drain through a flannel bag, without squeezing 
it. To each p>nt of juice, put a pound of white sugar, and 
the b^'Aten white of an egg to three pounds of the sugar. Sot

comes a jelly, which is ascertained by taking a little of it up 
mlo a tumbler of cold water. If it falls to the bottom in a 
solid mass, it is sufiiciently boiled 

330. Cranberry, Grape, cmd Currant Jelly. 

They are all made in the same naimer. Take the frui 
?n its prime, wash and drain it till neurly dry, then put it in 
an earthen jar, or pot, and set the pot in a kettle of hot wa- 
ter. Set the kettle where the water will boil, taking care 
that none of it gets into the jar. When the fruit breaks, 
turn it into a fiannel bag, and let it drain slowly through, into 
a deep dish, without squeezing. When the juice hai all pass- 
ed through the bag, put to each pint of it a pound and a half 
of white sugar. Put to each quart of the syrup the beaten 
white of an ^%^^* Set the syrup where it will boil gently— 
as fast as any scum rises, take the syrup from the fire, and 
skim it clear. When the jelly has boiled fifteen or twenty 
minutes, try a little of it in a tumbler of cold water — ^if it 
sinks to the bottom of the tumbler in a solid lump, it is ^uffi-^ 
ciently boiled. Jellies are improved by being put in the sun 
for several days— care must be taken tiiat the dew does not 
tall on them. 

^31. Qumce Jelly, 

Halve the quinces, and take out the cores. Boil the quinces 
till very soft, in clear water, mash them, and let them drain 
through a flannel bag, without squeezing them. Piit to the 
quince liquor, when drained through the bag, white sugar, in 
the proportion of a pound to a pint of the Uquor/ Add the 
whites of eggs, and clarify it. When clear, boil it on a mod 
erate fire, till it becomes a thick jelly. Fill glasses with the 
jelly, and cover them tight. The quince pulp that remains 
{n the jelly-bag can be made into marmalade. 

332. AjpfU Jelly, 

Halve tart apples, and take out the cores. Boil them til! 
^ry soft, in a large proportion of water— then let it pose

through a jeily-bag, without squeezing them. Weigh the 
• iquor, and to each pint of it put a pound of white sugars- 
then boil it slowly till it becomes a thick jelly, which is as. 
certained in the same manner as currant jelly. If you wish 
to have it of a red tinge, put in, when taken from the fire, a 
little cranberry or beet-juice. If you wish to have it a straff 
color, put in a little tincture of sfaffron. If green, use the 
expressed juice of spinach leaves. Let it pass through di8 
jelly-bag again — when cool, turn it into glasses. 

333. Lemon Jetty. 

Put on a slow fire an ounce of white isinglass, pulled into 
small pieces, and rinsed, a pint of water, with the rind of six 
lemons. Stir it constantly till dissolved, then add a pint or 
lemon-juice, and sweeten it to the taste with nice white su 
gar. Boil the whole four or five minutes, then color it with 
tincture of saffron, and let it pass through a flannel bag, with- 
out squeezing it. Fill your jelly glasses with it when partly 
cooled. 

834. Calf s Feet Jelhf. 

Take four feet, (that have been perfectly cleaned,) and boil 
them, in Ibur quarts of water, till very soft, and the water is 
reduced to one quart. Take it from the fire, and let it re- 
main till perfectly cold, then take off all the fat, and scrape 
off the dregs that adhere to the jelly. Put the jelly in a 
preserving kettle, set it on a slow fire — ^when it melts, take 
it from the fire, and mix with it half a pint of white wine, the 
juice and grated rind of a couple of fresh lemons, and a stick 
of cinnamon or mace. Wash and wipe dry six eggs — ^take 
the whites of them, and beat them to a froth — stir them into 
the jelly when it is cool — bruise the shells, and mix them vnXh 
th3 jelly, then set it on a few coals. Sweeten it, when hot, to 
the taste — white sugar is the best, but brown answers very 
well. Let the whole boil slowly fifleen minutes, without stir 
ring it — suspend a flannel bag on a nail, and let the jeUy 
drain through it, into a deep dish or pitcher. If it is not clear 
the first time, let it pass through the bag till it becomes so 
The bag should not be squeezed, otherwise the jelly will nol

txie glasses, if the weather is hot, into cold water, and keep 
them in a cool place. This kind of jelly will keep tmt a few 
days, in warm weather. A knuckle of veal, and sheep's feet, 
v^ake a nice jelly, prepared in the same manner as calf's feet* 

335. Hartshorn Jelly. 

Boil four ounces of hartshorn shavings in a couple of ou?rt8 
of water,, till it becomes a thick jelly — ^then strain anc. put to 
ft the juicQ and rmd of a couple of lemons, a wine glass of 
white wine, and a stick of cinnamon. Wash four fresh eggs, 
wipe them dry, separate the whites from the yelks, beat the 
whites to a froth, bruise the shells, and mix them with the 
hartshorn — set the whole on a moderate fire— sweeten it to 
the tnste when hot. Boil it till it becomes quite thick, then 
bt it drain through a jelly-bag till clear. 

336. Coffee. 

Old Java and Mocha coffee are the best kinds. Coffee 
should be put in an iron pot, and dried over a moderate fire 
for several hours, before it is roasted. It should be put at 
such a distance from the fire, as to be in no danger of burn, 
ing. When it has dried three or four hours, set the pot or 
a hot bed of coals, and stir it constantly, until suiRcienth 
**oasted, which is ascertained by biting one of the lightest 
colored kernels — if it is brittle, the whole is done. Turn ii 
out of the pot i-nmediately, into a box — cover it tight, to keep 
in the steam. A cx)ffee-roaster is better than a pot to roasi 
coffee in, as it pres^^rves the fine aromatic flavor of ae cof- 
fee, which in a grea* meapure escapes with the st^am of the 
coffee, when roasted in an open pot. To make good com- 
mon coffee, allow a tab'e spoonful of it, when ground, to each 
pint of water. Turn on the water boiling hot, and boil the 
coffee in a tin pot, from ttyenty to twenty-five minutes— if 
boileo -onger, it will not taste frerh and lively. Let it stand, 
after being taken from the fire, four or five minutes to settle, 
ihan tarn it off carefully from the g^imda, mto a coffee-pot 
or urn. When the coffee is put on the fire to ooil, a piece 
of fish-skih or isinglass, of the size of h nine pence, should 
be put in, or else the white and shell of ha^f an ef^. tc a ecu. 
pie ff quarts o coffee. Many persons dislike to clea*' roflfon

De taken from mild cod Ash, that has not been soaked, as the 
skin loses its clearing properties by soaking. Rinse it in 
cold water and dry it perfectly. When dried, cut it hiU 
pieces of the size of a nine-pence. If torn off, as it is wa!i * 
ed for use, too much is apt to be put in at once, and give tha 
cofiee a bad taste. A piece of the size of a twelve ind a 
half cent piece, is sufficient t(^ settle a couple of quarts of 
water. French coffee is made in a German filter, the water 
is turned on boiling hot, and one- third more coffee is neces- 
sary than when boiled in the common way. Where cream 
cannot be procured for coffee, 'the coffee will be much richer 
to boil it with a less proportion of water than the above 
rule, and weaken it with boiling hot milk, when served out in 
cups. 

337. Tea. 

Scald the tea-pot, and if the tea is a strong kind, a tea- 
spoonful for a pint of water is sufficient — ^if it is a weak kind, 
noore will be required. Pour on just enough boiling wate* 
to cover the tea, and let it steep. Green tea should not steep 
more than five or six minutes before drinking — if stee|)ed 
longer, it will not be lively. Black tea requires steeping ten 
or twelve minutes to extract the strength. 

338. Qhocolate. 

Scrape the chocolate off fine, mix It smooth with water — 
if Uked very rich, make the chocolate entirely of milk — if 
not, use half water. Boil water and milk together, then stir 
in the chocolate, previously mixed with water — stir it till it 
boils, then sweeten it to your taste, and take it up. If liktid 
rich, grate in a little nutmeg. A table-spoonful of choco^i 
late to a pint of water or milk, is about the right proportioiv 

339. Hop Beer. 

Put to six ounces of hops five quarts of water, and 6oi! 
them three hours — ^then strain off the liquor, and put to the 
hops four quarts more of water, a tea-cup full of ginger, and 
boil the hops three hours longer. Strain and mix it with the '

rpst of the liquor, ftnd stir in a couple of quarts of molasses. 
Take about half a pound of bread, and brown it very slowly 
— when very brown and dry, put it in the liquor, to enrich the 
beer. Rusked bread is the best for this purpose, biit a loaf 
of bread cut in slices, and toasted till brittle, will dc very welL 
When rusked bread is used, pound it fine, and brown it in a 
pot, as you would coffee, stirring it constantly. When the 
hop liquor cools, so as to be just lukewarm, add a pint of new 
ye&3t, that has no salt in it. Keep the beer covered in a tern 
perate si';uJition, till it has ceased fermenting, which is ascer 
tained by the subsiding of the froth-*-turn it off carefully into 
a beer keg, or bottles. The beer should not be corked very 
tight, or it will burst the bottles. It should be kept in a cool 
place. 

340. Beer of Essential Ode. 

Mix a couple of quarts of boiling water with a pint and a 
half of molasses. Stir in five quarts of cold water, then add 
ten drops of the oil of sassafras, ten of spruce, fifteen of win- 
ter-green, and a tea-spobnful of essence of ginger. When 
just lukewarm, put in half a pint of fresh lively yeast. When 
fermented, bottle and cork it, and keep it in a cool place. It 
will be fit to drink in the course of two or three days. 

341. Spring Beer. 

Take a small bunch of all, or part of the following : Sweet 
fern, sarsaparilla, winter-green, sassafras, prince's pine, and 
spice wood. Boil them with two or three ounces of hops to 
three or four gallons of water, acnd two or three raw potatoes, 
pared and cut in slices. The strength of the roots and hops 
is obtained more thoroughly by boiling vhem in two waters-— 
for, when the liquor is strongly saturated with the hops, it will 
rather bind up the roots than extract their juices. The roots 
hould be boiled five or six hours — ^the liquor should then be 
twined, and a quart of molasses put to three gallons of the 
Beer. If you wish to have the beer very rich, brown half 
a pound of bread, and put it into the liquor. If the liquor is 
too thick, dilute it with cold water. When just lukewarm, 
put in a pint of fresh lively yeast, that has no salt in it. The 
aalt has a tendency to keep it from fermentuig. Keep it in 



\ 



i 10 WINES. 

a temperate situation, covered over, but not so tight as to ex 
elude the air entirely, or it will not work. When ferniontea 
keep it in a tight keg, or bottle and cork it up. 

342. Ginger Beer, 

Boil gently, in a gallon of water, three table-spoonsful o! 
cream of tartar, three of ginger, and .a lemon cu^ in elicest 
When it has boiled half an hour, take it from the fire, strain 
and sweeten it to your taste — ^white sugar is the best, but 
brown sugar or molasses answers very well. Put to it, when 
ukewarm, half a pint of fresh yeast. Turn it off carefully, 
when fermented, bcittle it, and keep it in a cool place. It will 
be fit to drink in the course of seven or eight days. 

343. Instantaneous Beer. 

Put to a pint and a half of .water four tea-spoonsful of gm- 
ger, a table-spOonful of lemon-juice — sweeten it to the taste 
with syrup or white sugar, and turn it into a junk bottle. Have 
ready a cork to fit the bottle, a string of wire to tie it down, 
and a mallet to drive in the cork. Then put into the bottle 
a heaping tea-spoonful of the super-carbonate of soda, corK 
it immediately, tie it down, then shake the whole up well, cut 
the string, and the cork will fly out. Turn it out, and drink 
immediately. 

344. Mixed Wine. 

Take equal parts of ripe currants, grapes, raspberries, and 
English cherries. Bruise them, then mix cold water with them, 
in the proportion of four pouods of fruit to a gallon of water. 
Let the whole remain half a day. Stir the whole up well, 
then strain it — ^to each gallon of it put three pounds of sugar. 
Keep it in a temperate situation, where it will ferment slowly 
three or four days — stir it up frequently. When fermented, 
add a ninth part of brandy to it, and stop it up tight — when 
it becomes clear, bottle it. In the course of a year it will be 
fit to drink. 

345. Currant Wine, 

Strain the currants, which should be perfectly ripe. To 
B»ic>* quart of juice put a couple of quarts of water and thref 



CORDIALS. m 

),/>und« of sugar— €tir the whole well t( gether, and let it stand 
twenty-four hours, without stirring — ^then skim and set it in a 
cool place, where it will ferment slowfy. Let it remain three 
or four days — ^if, at the end of that time, it has ceased fer- 
menting, arid one quart of French brandy to every fifteen 
gallons of Lie liquor, and close up the barrel tight. When it 
becomes clear, it is fit to bottle. This will be good in the 
course of six months, but it is much improved by being kept 
several years. 

346. Grape Wine, 

Bruise the grapes, which should be perfectly ripe. To each 
gallon of grapes put a gallon of water, and let the whole re- 
main a week, without being stirred. At the end of that time, 
draw off the liquor carefully, and put to each gallon three 
pounds of lump sugar. I^et it ferment in a temperate situa- 
tion — ^when fermented, stop it up tight. In the course of six 
months it will be fit to bottle. 

347. To mull Wine. 

To a pint of water put a tea-spoonful of powdered cloves 
and cinnamon. Set it where it will boil — ^then separate the 
whites and yelks of three eggs, and beat th« yelks with a 
large spoonful of powdered white sugar. As soon as the 
water boils, turn it on to the yelks and sugar — add a pint of 
wine, and turn the beaten whites of the eggs over the whole. 

348. Quince Cordial* 

Take ripe nice quinces, wipe off the fur, and grate them. 
Express the juices of the quince pulp through a strong cloth, 
and to each quart of it put two-thirds of a quart of French 
brandy, a pound and a half of white sugar, a hundred bitter 
almonds, or peach meats, a dozen cloves. Put it in a stone pot, 
cov<^r it tight, and keep it a week in a warm place, then skim 
eind bottle it, and let it remain a year before using it. 

349. Peach Cordial. 

Take ripe juicy peaches — wash and wipe them, to get off 
the down — gash them to the stone. Put to each peck of 
peaches a gallon of French brandy, and cover them up tight. 



ll8 SHRUBS. 

Let the whole remain a couple of morths, then drain *he 
oraudy free from the peaches — add sufficient cold water to 
render it of the strength of good wljite wine, and to every 
thj'ee gallons of it put four pounds of sugar. Stir it up we'l 
— ^let it remain a couple of days, stirring it up well each daji^ 
then turn it into a wine cask, and close it tight. 

350. Smallage Cordial, 

Take young sprouts of smallage — wash and drain then 
till perfectly dry. Cut them in small pieces, put them in a 
bc3ttle, with seeded raisins, having an alternate layer of each. 
When the bottle is two-thijrds' full of the smallage, turn in 
French brandy, till the bottle is full. Let it remain three oi 
four days, to have the smallage absorb the brandy — ^then put 
in as much more brandy as the bottle will hold. It will be fit 
for use in the course of eight or ten da3rs. This is an excel- 
lent family medicine. 

851. Currant Shrub, 

To a pint of strained currant juice, put a pound of sugar. 
Boil the sugar and juice gently together, eight or ten minutes, 
then set it where it will cool. Add, when lukewarm, a wine 
glass of French brandy to every pint of syrup — ^bottle and 
cork it tight — ^keep it in a cool place. 

352. Raspberry Shrub, 

To three quarts of fresh, ripe raspberries, put one of good 
vinegar. Let it remain a day — ^then strain it, and put to each 
pint a pound of white sugar. Boil the whole together for hali 
au hour, skim it clear. When cool, add a wine glass of 
Fronch brandy to each pint of the shrub. A couple of ta- 
ble-spoonsfgl of this, mixed with a tumbler two-thirds' full of 
water, is a wholesome and refreshing drink in fevers* 

353. Lemon Shrub, 

Procure nice fresh lemons — ^pare the rind off thin, then 
squeeze out the juice of the lemons, and strain it. To a pint 
of the juice put a'^xMind of white sugar, broken into small 
pieces. Measure out for each pint of the syrup three table- 
spoonsful of French brandy, and soak the rind of the lenionf 



BSSBNCSS. 110 

m iU Let the whole remain a da^, stirring up the ieinoo^ 
juice and sugar frequently. The next day turn off the syrupy 
and mix it with the brandy and lemon rinds — ^put the whole 
in clean bottles, cork and seal them tight, and keep them id 
dry sand, in a cool place. 

354. Sherbet. 

Boll in three pints of water six or eight green stalks of 
rhubarb, a quarter of a pound of figs or raisins. When the 
whole has boiled between twenjy-five and thirty minutes, 
strain it, and mix it v^ith a tea-spoonful of rosewater, and 
lemon or orange syrup to the taste. Let it get cold before 
drinking it. 

355. Noyeau. 

To three pints of French brandy, put four ounces of bitter 
almonds, or peach meats, and a couple of ounces of sweet 
almonds — ^they should be bruised before they are mixed with 
the brandy. Add half an ounce each of powdered cinnamon 
and mace, a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Let the whole 
remain a fortnight, shaking it up well each day, then drain 
off the brandy into another bottle, and put to the almonds a 
quart of water. Let it stand three days, then turn back the 
brandy, and put in a pound and a half of white sugar. Let 
the whole remain a week, stirring it up frequently, then strain 
the liquor off, free from the dregs, into bottles for use. 

356. Mead. 

Put to a pound of honey three pints of warm water — stir 
n up well, and let it remain till the honey is held in complete 
solution — then turn it into a cask, leaving the bung out. Let 
It ferment in a temperate situation — ^bottle it as soon as fer 
mented, cork it up very tight. 

357. Essence of Lemon. 

Turn gradually on to a drachm of the hesi oil of lemons 
a couple of ounces of strong reified spirit. The best meth. 
od of obtaining the essence of the lemon peel, is to rub aU 
the yellow part of the peel off, with lumps of white sugar and 
scrape off the surface of the sugar into a preserving pch, mi 



rhat JiK t becofnf« saturated with the oil of Ae .©mon. Tho 
sugar siiould be pressed down tight, and covered very ?.oflo 
A little of this sugar gives a fine flavor to puddings,- cakes 
and pies. This mode of preserving the essence of the lemon 
is superior to the one in which spirit is used, as the fine ar'V 
matic flavor of the peel is procured without any alloy. 

358. Essence of Ginger, 

Take three ounces of fresh ginger — grate and put it into 
a quart of French brandy, together with the rind of a fresh 
'hmon — ^none of the white part of the peel should be put in. 
Shake the whole up well every day, for eight or ten days — al 
the end of that time, it will be fit for use. A little of this, 
mixed with water, or put on a lump of sugar, answers all the 
purposes of ginger tea, and is much more palatable. It is 
also nice to flavor many kinds of sweetrapfl-ls. 

859. Spice Brandy. 

Kut into a jar French brandy, and rose or peach jeaves m 
the proportion of a quart of the former to ha.f a pint of the 
latter. Let them steep together, till the strength is obtained 
from the leaves — ^then turn ofT the brandy, squeeze the leaves 
dry, throw them away, and put fresh leaves to the brandy. 
Continue to go through the above process until the brandy is 
strongly impregnated with the leaves — then tuwi the brandy 
off clear, and bottle it — ^keep it corked tight. Lemon or 
orange peel, and peach meats, steeped in a bottle of brandy, 
give it a fine flavor. It takes the rind of three or four lemons, 
or a quarter of a pound of peach meats, to flavor a pint of 
brandy. When all the brandy is used, put in more, with a 
few fresh rinds. Spice brandy is very nice to season cakes, 
puddings, and mince pies. 

800. Rosevsxter. 

Gather fhigrant, full-blown roses, on a dry day-«^ck off 
the leaves, and to each peck of them put a quart of water 
Put the whole in a cold still, and set the still on a moderate 
firo— the slower they are distilled^ the better will be the roa^- 
water. Bottle the water as soon as distilled* 



PERFUMERY. 12 1 

361. To extract the Essential Oil of Fbwcrs. 

P.ocure a quantity of fresh, fragrant leaves — ^both the stalk 
and .he flower leaves will answer. Cord very thin layers of 
cotton, and dip them into fine Florence oil — ^pui alternate 
layers of the cotton and leaves in a glass jar, or large tum- 
bler. Sprinkle a very small quantity of fine salt on each lay- 
er of the flowers, cover the jar up tight, and place it in a south 
irindow, exposed to the heat of the sun. In the course of a 
fortnight a fragrant oil jmay be squeezed out of the cotton. 
Rose leaves, mignonette, and sweet-scented clover, make fine 
perfumes, managed in this way. 

362. Perfume Bags, 

Rose and sweet-scented clover leaves, dried in the shade^ 
then mixed with powdered cloves, cinnamon, mace, and press- 
ed in small bags, are very nice to keep in chests of linen, or 
drawers of clothes, to perfume them. 

363. Cologne Water. 

Turn a quart of alcohol gradually on to the following oils . 
a couple of drachms of the oil of rosemary, two of the oil of 
lemon, or orange-flower water, one drachm of lavender, ten 
drops of oil of cinnamon, ten of cloves, and a tea-spoonful of 
rosewater. Keep the whole stopped tight in a bottle — shake 

t up well. It will do to use as soon as made, but it is much 

niproved by age. 

364. Lavender Water. 

Turn a pint of alcohol slowly on to an ounce and a half of 
lie oil of lavender, two drachms of ambergris. Keep the 
avender water in a tight-corked bottle— it should be shook 
it» well when first put Jn. 

36&. AronutUc Vinegar. 

Mix with a table-spoonful of vinegar enough powde.eo 
snalk to destroy the acidity. Let it settle — then turn off the 
vinegar from the chalk carefully, and dry it perfe(>*iy. When- 
ever yo\i wish to purify an infected room, put m a faw drops 
of sulphuric acid— -the fumes arising from it ,ftl yinfy a

necessary in using it, not to inhale the fumes, <t lo get\ aiiy 
of the acid on your garments, as it will corrode whatever it 
touches 

360. Barley Water. 

Boil a couple of ounces of barley, in two quarts of water 
till soft — ^pearl barley is the best, but the common barley an^ 
ewers very well. When soft, strain and mix it with a dttle 
currant jelly, to give it a pleasant, acid taste. If the jei.y is 
not liked, turn it, when boiled soft, on to a couple of ouncei* 
of figs or raisins, and boil it again, till reduced to one quart 
then strain it for use. 

367. Rice Gruel. 

Put a large spoonful of unground rice into six gills ot 
tioiling water, with a stick of cinnamon or mace. Strain ii 
when boiled soft, and add half a pint of new milk — ^put in a 
tea-spoonful of salt, and boil it a few minutes longer. If you 
wish to make the gruel of rice flour, mix a table-spoonful oi 
it, smoothly, with three of cold water, and stir it into a quart 
of boiling water. Let it boil five or six minutes, stirring it 
constantly. Season it with salt, a little butter, and add, if 
you like, nutmeg and white sugar to your taste. 

368. Water Gruel. 

Mix a couple of table-spoonsful of Indian meal with ono 
of wheat flour, and sufficient cold water to make a thick bat- 
ter. If the gruel is liked thick, stir it into a pint of boiling 
water — ^if liked thin, more water will be necessary. Season 
the gruel with salt, and let it boil six or eight minutes, stirring 
it frequently — then take it from the fire, put in a piece of but 
ter of the size of a walnut, and pepper to the taste. Turn i 
on toasted brr3ad, cut in small pieces. 

369. Caudle.

370. Arrow Root Quslirds. 

Boil a pint of milk, and stir into it, while boiling, a tablc« 
spoonful of arrow root, mixed smooth, with a little cold milk. 
Stir it in well, and let the whole boil three or four minutes- 
take it from the fire to cool — when so, stir in a couple of beat. 
9n eggs, sweeten it to the taste, and grate in a small piece 
of nutmeg. Set the whole where it will boil, stirring it con- 
stantly. As soon as it boils up, take it from the fire, and 
turn it into custard cups. The arrow root, prepared in the 
same manner as for the custards, omitting the sugar, spice > 
and eggs, is excellent. food for invalids, and can be eaten 
when the custards aie too rich for the stomach. 

371. Wine Whey. 

Stir into a pint of boiling milk a couple of glasses of wine* 
Let it boil a minute, then take it from the fire, and let it re- 
main till the curd has settled — ^then turn off the whey, and 
sweeten it with white sugar. 

372. Stomachic Tincture. 

Bruise a couple of ounces of Peruvian bark, one of bitter 
dried orange peel. Steep them in a pint of proof spirit a 
fortnight, shaking up the bottle that contains it once or twice 
every day. Let it remain untouched for a couple of days, 
then decant the bitter into another bottle. A tea-spoonful ot 
this, in a wine glass of water, is a fine tonic. 

373. Thoroughwort Bitters. 

. ^ Make a strong tea of the thoroughwort — strain it, and when 

cool, put to a couple of quarts of it half a pint of French 
brandy, the peel of two or three fresh oranges, cut into small 
) bits, and half a dozen bunches of fennel, or smallage seed. 

The seed and orange peel should be crowded into a bottle, 
then the tea and brandy turned in. The bottle shoujd be 
:x)rked tight. The bitters will keep good almost any length 
jf time, and is an excellent remedy for bilious complaints, 
and can oflen be taken when the thoroughwort tea will 
not sit on the stomach. A wine glass of these bitters to a 
tumbler of water is about the right proportion. It should 
have a little sugar added to it before drinkmg it.

374. Cough Tea. 

MaKe a strong tea of everlasting — strain, and put to a qaait 
of it two ounces of figs or raisins, two of liquorice cut in 
bits. Boil them in the tea for twenty minutes, then take the 
tea from the fire, and add to it the juice of a lemon^ This !& as 
excellent remedy for a tight cough — ^it should be drank frecij;

375. Beef Tea. 

Broil a pound of fresh lean beef ten minutes — ^then cut it 
into small bits, turn a pint of boiHiig water on it, and let it 
steep in a warm place half an hour — ^then strain it, and sea- 
son the tea with salt and pepper to the taste. This is a quick 
way of making the tea, but it is not so good, when the sto- 
mach will bear but a little liquid on it, as the following meth. 
od : Cut the beef into i^jnall bits, which should be perfectly 
free from fat — fill a junk bottle with them, cork it up tight, 
and immerse it in a kettle of lukewarm water, and boil it four 
or five hours. This way is superior to the first, on account 
of obtaining the juices of the meat, unalloyed with water, a 
table-spoonful of it being as nourishing as a tea-cup full of 
the other. 

376. Moss Jelly. 

Steep Carragua, or Irish moss, in cold water a few min< 
utes, to extract the bitter taste — ^then drain off the water, and 
to half an ounce^of moss put a quart of fresh water, and a 
stick of cinnamon. Boil it till it becomes a thick jelly, then 
strain it, and season it to the taste with white wine and white 
sugar. This is very nourishing, and recommended highly 
ibr consumptive complaints. 

377. Sago Jelly. 

Rinse four ounces of sago thoroughly, then soak it in toUi 
water half an hour — ^turn off the water, and put to it a pin! 
and a half of fresh cold water. Let it soak in it half an houn

THE WHOLE ART OF CARVING 



PRELIMINARY REMARKS. 



The carving knife should be light, of middling size, and uf 
a fine edge. Strength is less required than skiH in the man* 
ner of using it ; and to facilitate this, the butcher should be 
directed to divide the joints of the bones of all carcass joints 
of mutton, Iamb, and veal, (such as neck, breast, and loin,) 
which then may easily be cut into thin slices, attached to 
tne oones. If the whole of the meat belonging to each bone 
should be too thick, a small slice may be taken off between 
ftvery two bones. 

The more fleshy joints (as fillets of veal, leg or saddle of 
mutton, and beef,) are to be helped in thin slices, neatly cut, 
and smooth. Observe to let the knife pass down to fiie bone 
m the mutton and beef joints. 

The dish should not be too far off the carver, as it gives 
An awkward o^ppearance, and makes the task more difficult. 
Attention is to be paid to help every one to a part of such ar- 
(icles as are considered best. 

In helping fish, take care not to break the flakes, which in 
eod and very fresh salmon are large, and contribute much to 
^he beauty of its appearance. A fish knife not being sharps 
divides it best. Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each 
person. The heads of carp, part of those of cod and salmon, 
sounds of cod, and fins of turbot, are likewise esteemed nice« 
des, and are to be attended to accordingly. 

In cutting up any wild fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, for a 
large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion to pinion, 
^thout making wings, there will be more handsome pieces. 

1. Sirloin of Beef . 

This may be begun at either end, or by cutting in the raid* 
i!e. It is usual to inquire wnether the outsida or inside is 
preferred. For the outside, the slice should be cut down to 
tne bones, and die same with every following helping. Slice

place instead one of silver. 

8. Shoulder of MtiHon. '

joint, and by many pre- 
ferred to the leg ; for,

abounds in gmvy, and 
" produces many nice bits.

are reckoned the finest part, but some people prefer the neck 
and between the shoulders. 

- 9, Half a Calf^s Head, hoiled. 

Be careful and get 
a young one, as they 
look much handsomer 
served up, and be- 
sides are more ten- 
der. First cut in the 
direction c, b. The 
throat bread is con- 
sidered the choicest 
lart ; it lies in the* fleshy portion, near the termination of the 
jaw-bone, and the line c, d, shows the direction to cut into it 
On the under part of the lower jaw there is some very nice 
meat ; and about the ear, g, some fat rather gristly, but 
highly esteemed. The part near the neck is very inferior. 
Somejjmes the bone in the line f, e, is cut off, but this is a 
coarse part. The sweet tooth is quite a delicacy — ^it lies 
back of all the rest, and, in a young calf, is easily extracted 
with the knife. Many like t^e eye, which you must cut out 
with the point of your knife, and divide in two. Under the 
head is the palate, which is reckoned a nicety. 

10. Leg of Mutton. 




A leg of wether 
mutton, (which ifl 
best flavored) may 
be known at the 
market by a round 
lump of fat at the 
edge of the broadest 
part, a little above 
the letter a. The 
oest part is midway between the knuckle and ferther end. 
Begin to help there, by cutting tliin slices to b. If the out- 
side is not fat enough, h^lp some from the side at the broad 
end, in sices from e iof. This part is most juicy, but many 
prefer the knuckle, which, in fine mutton, will be very tender

ihou^i dry. Tbera are very iine slices in the back of t 
!eg — turn it up, and cut the broad end, aot in the direcUuii 
you did the other eide, but lengthwise. To cut out the cran^ 
bone, take hold of the ahank (which should be previously 
wound round with half a sheet of fool's-cap paper) with youi 
ufl hand, and cut down to the thigh bone at g, .hen ,ias9 the 
koifa under the cramp bone, in the direction g, d. 
11. Ham. 

Ham may be cut 
three ways ; the com - 
mon method is to be- 
gin in the roiduki, 1^ 
long slices ficm b to 
c, from tlie centre, 
through the thick fnt. 
This brings to the 
prime at first, which is likewise accompli^Lcji by cutting a 
small round hole on the top of the ham, aj &t a, and with a 
sharp knife enlarging that, by cutting succedsive thin circles 
— this preserves the gravy, and keeps the meat moist. The 
last, and most saving way, is to begin at the hock end, (which 
many are most fond of,) and proceed onward. Ham that is 
used for pies, &c., should be cut from the under side. 
12. Fore Quarter of Lamb. 

Separate tlie 
shoulder from the 
breast and ribs, by 
passing the knife 
under, in the di. 
rectioD of a, b, e, 
and d. Be care 
ful to keep it to- 
wards you horisontally, to prevent cutting the meat 'jx> mnch 
off the bones. If grass lamb, the shoulder being Ai^ge, piU 
it uto a another dish. Squeeze the juice of half a Seville 
orange or lemon on the other part, and sprinkle a litte aa t 
and pepper ; then separate the gristly part from the ribs, is 
the line e, c, anrf help either from that or from the ribe, aa may 
be chosen.

THS ART OF CABVINO. 

18. Croose. 




Turn the neck end 
of the goose towarda 
you, and cut the 
whole breast in slices 
on each side of the 
bird, but only re- 
move them as yoo 
help each person, un 
less the company is so large as to require tne logs likewise. 
Turn the goose on one side, and then take off the leg by put- 
ting the fork into the small end of the leg bone, pressing it 
close to the body ; and, having passed the knife in the line e, 

d, turn the leg back, and, if a young bird, it will easily sepa- 
rate. 

To take off the wing, put your fork into the small end of 
the pinion, and p^ess it close to the body; then put in the 
knife at c, and divide the joint, taking it down in the direction 
c, d. Nothing but practice will enable people to hit the joint 
exactly at the first trial. When the leg and wing of one side 
are done, go on to the other ; cut off the apron in the line fj 

e, gy then take off the merry-thought in the line o, i. The 
neck bones are next to be separated as in a fowl, and all other 
parts divided the same. 

19. ^ Fowl 

A boiled fowl's legs are bent 
inwards, but before it is served, 
the skewers are to be removed. 
Lay the fowl on your plate, and 
place the joints as cut off on 
the dish. Take the wing off, 
in the direction of a to &, in the 
annexed engraving, only divi- 
ding the joint with your knife; and then, with your tork, lifl 
up the pinion, and draw the wings towards the logs, and the 
muscles will separate in a more complete form than if cut. 
Slip the knife between the leg and body, and cut to the bone 
ihen. with the fork, turn the leg back, and, if the bird is not 




THE ABT Ol- CARVING. 143 

Did, the joint will give way. When the four quarters are thus 
removed, take off the merry-thought from Oj and the necK 
bones, these last by putting in the knife at c, and pressing it 
under the long broad part of the bone, in the Ime c, h ; then 
lift it up, and break it off from the part that stick? to the 
breast. The next thing is to divide the breast from the car- 
cass, by cutting through the tender ribs, close to the breast, 
quite doMm to the end of the fowl ; lay the back up, put your . 
Knife into the bone, half way from the neck to the rump, and 
on raismg the lower part, it will readily separate. Turn 
Cne neJCK towards you, and very neatly take off the two sides- 
men, and the whole will be done. As each part is taken off, 
it should be turned neatly on the dish, and care should be 
taxen that what is left should go properly from the table. The 
breast and wings are looked upon as the best parts, but the 
legs are most juicy in young fowls. After all, more advan- 
tage will be gained by observing those who carve well, and a 
little practice, than by any written directions whatever. 

20. Partridge. 

This bird is cut up in the same way as a fowl. The besc 
parts are the wings, breast, and merry -thought ; but the bird 
being small, the two latter are not often divided. The wing 
11) considered the best, and the tip is reckoned th*^ most deli- 
cate morsel of the whole. 

21. Pigeons. 

Pigeons are considered very fine eating. It is u«uai to cut 
tlicm in half, either from top to bottom, or across. Fhe ^ow* 
er part is generally thought best. 

22. Turkey, 

Fix your fork firmly in the lower part of the breast, so as 
to have full command of the turkey.^ Slice down on each 
side of the centre of the breast, two or three lines lengthwise 
' with the body ; then take off the leg on one side, holding the 
knife in a sloping direction, the point turned towards the ena 
of the body. This done, cut off the wing on the sar^e side, 
hi c line nearly parallel with the length of the turkei 



IM TBB AVf or CAKTIRa 

Wliea you have thua separated the wings and legs, take iJ 
from the breast bone the parts you before sliced down. Bi 
\'ery attentive, in separatiog the wing, not to cut too near tha 
Deck, or you will find yourself interrupted by the neck Lcm\ 
from which the wing must be taken. 

23. Cod's Head. 

Fish in genera 
requires very lilt!e 
carving, the fleshy 
parts being those 
principally esteem- 
ed. A cod's head 
and shoulders, when 
in season, and properly boiled, is a very genteel and hand- 
some dish. When cut, it should he done with a fish trowel ; 
the parts about the ' back -bone, or the shoulders, are by far 
the firmest and best. Take off a piece quite down to the 
bone, in the direction a, h, c, d, putting in the spoon at a, e, 
and with each slice of the fish give a piece of the round, 
which lies underneath the hack-bone, and lines it, the meat 
of which is Ihin, and a little darker colored than the body of 
Uie fish itself. This may be got by passing a spoon under il, 
in tlie direction d,f. ■ About the head are many delicate parts, 
ands great deal of the jelly kind. The jelly part lies about the 
jaw-bone, and the firm parts within the head. Some are fond 
of the palate, and others the tongue, which lihewise may bo 
got oy putting a spoon into the moulb.

found useful in conveying sound moral instruction as well as giving the op« 
WMrtunity to display memory and vivacity in rendering them.

PRESEH^ES

Ark sometimes deadly poisons, in consequence of the improper material of the t 
sels in which they are made or are contained. If made in copper or brass ketti 
the utmost and closest attention should be given, to see that every spot the size o' 
a pin should fairly glisten by vigorous and thorough scouring. But even this will 
not avail if the preserves themselves are imperfectly sweetened, or are not thor- 
oughly cooked. A defect in either caAe wtH result in corroding the cans or jars in 
which they are put for keeping. Tiuft cavroaioa makes chemical combinations 
which are fatal to life, or lay the foundat'on for long, distressing, and obscure dis- 
eases. The only perfectly safe preserve-jar is that Which is made of glass. All 
others ought to be discarded. They &rQ cheap, more easily and more perfectly 
cleaned, and with reasonable care, will last a lifetime. And as every family with any 
claim to thrift, respectability, and hospitality, aims to have more or less of ^* prp 
serves" for the winter mouths, the fact of having safe '^reserves," as to health 
of very general interest; otherwise they are no " preserves'* at all, but "destr 
tives*^ alike to health and even life. It certainly would be better to have none ^ 
all, for they tempt us to eat when we do not feel much like eating, especially at tee 
time, and thus aid in making many miserable dyspeptics; but as ^Uhrifty house- 
wives** will have them, it is well to instruct the public as to the best meians of hav- 
ing them free from actual poison. It is to be hoped that no intelligent, conscien- 
tious person will keep preserves in any other vessel hereafter than those of glass. 
The jars should be made of ** blown," not pressed glass, and if uniformly thin, are 
less liable to break by the fermentation of their contents. 

But as external air will cause fermentation, every jar should be made perfectly 
air-tight. Cork alone can never do this, unless a treneh is dug in a good cellar and 
he filled jars are put in, mouths down, and then well covered with earth or sand 
better plan is that advised by the Scientific Ameriean. Waied cloth tied over 
[ 3 jar is a substitute at once cheap and effective, and we have never found any thing 
'crior to it. Prepare the ck>th thus : melt together some rosin, beeswax, and 
ow in equal parts ; tear the cloth in strips four inches wide, or at least wide 
ugh conveniently to tie over the iQOuth of the jar, and dip these strips, drawing 
1 through the hot wax and stripping nearly all Ibe wax off. With cloth thus 
' ired, after the jar is filled with hot preserves, and while still hot, close the 
a, h and bind it on with good lineit cord. The^ with shears trim off as much of 
^a\ ued cloth as is desirable^ .id then dip it in some melted wax, which should
