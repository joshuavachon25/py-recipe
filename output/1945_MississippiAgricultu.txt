Cotton Variety Tests in the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta 

By J. WINSTON NEELY and SIDNEY G. BRAIN 
Delta Branch Experiment Station, Stoneville 



The 1944 cotton variety tests in the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta are a continua- 
tion of the practice by the Delta Branch 
Experiment Station to test varieties on 
dectcd • , itaations in the representative 
serr'ior.z of the Delta. 

In me lescs being reported, 12 varieties 
were grown at 7 locations: Stoneville, 
Tunica, Money, Heathman, Valley Hill, 
Yazoo City, and Kelso. Yields of seed 
cotton and lint, gin turn-out, staple 
length, boll size, the fiber bundle strength 
and length uniformity of fiber, earliness, 
and money value were determined. 

The Station is continuing the policy of 
adapting the cotton variety tests to the 
current needs of producers, buyers, spin- 
ners, weavers, and oil mill operators for 
information relative to the characteristics 
of varieties. During the time that the 
boll weevil was first becoming a produc- 
tion factor, information was provided re- 
garding the relative boll weevil tolerance 
of cotton varieties because of earliness. 
When pathogenic wilt became a produc- 
tion factor in certain areas of the Delta, 
information was provided regarding the 
relative wilt resistance of the different 
varieties. 

At the present time cotton mills are 
paying a great deal of attention to bundle 
strength and length uniformity, as meas- 
ured by laboratory methods, since these 
characteristics, along with length, give an 
indication of the resulting yarn strength. 
The current report is the second from 
this Station in which fiber strength and 
length uniformity for each of the vari- 
eties grown at each of the locations have 
been reported. This policy will be con- 
tinued, and as additional information rela- 
tive to the characteristics of cotton vari- 
eties is required, the tests will be extended 
to supply as much of this information as 
possible. 



The yields of each variety are based 
upon the weights of seed cotton harvest- 
ed from ten 1-row plots at each location. 

Gin turn-out values for each variety 
wer t determined by ginning the 100-boll 
samples from each location on a 10-saw 
gin. 

Staple lengths given are averages of 
lengths of 10 samples for each variety 
from each location, determined by the 
Staple Cotton Cooperative Association, 
Greenwood, Mississippi, and the Board 
of Cotton Examiners of the War Food 
Administration, Jackson. Mississippi. 

The size of boll was determined by 
averaging the weights of ten 100-boll sam- 
ples from each variety at each of the lo- 
cations. 

The percentage of cotton obtained from 
the first picking, which is considered as 
a measure of earliness, was determined 
by dividing the first picking by the 
weight of the total production. 

The bundle strength of fiber and the 
fiber length uniformity were determined 
in the Stoneville Fiber Laboratory of the 
War Food Administration. 

The acre values are based upon: (1) 
Yields of seed cotton and lint, (2) staple 
lengths, and (3) seed grades. The values 
for three grades — Middling, Strict Low 
Middling, and Low Middling — are given. 
The average prices for cotton of the re- 
spective grades and several lengths for 
the active Memphis spot market period, 
September 9 to November 10, 1944, were 
used. The seed were evaluated on a 
basis of $56, with premiums and discounts 
in accordance with official standards for 
grading cottonseed set up by the U. S. 
Department of Agriculture. The analyses 
were made in the Stoneville Laboratory 
of the War Food Administration. 

Oil, protein, moisture, and lint determi- 
nations were based upon two analyses of

COTTON VARIETY TESTS IN THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA 



5 



each of two samples from each variety 
at each location, with the exception of 
Yazoo City. Free fatty acids and foreign 
matter determinations were based upon 
one analysis of each of two samples from 
each variety at each location, with the 
exception of Yazoo City. Analyses of 
the Yazoo City samples were not made, 
and average values ' for seed from the 
other six locations were used in determ- 
ining money value per acre, since it was 
definitely determined that the average 
values were more representative of the 
actual value of the seed than a flat 100 
basis would be at Yazoo City. As far as 
the authors know, this is the first attempt 
to evaluate cotton varieties by taking into 
consideration the respective seed analyses. 

Differences required for significance 
between varietal averages are based upon 
the residual error in the analyses of the 
individual locations and the locations x 
varieties interaction in the analyses of the 
combined locations. These values are 
found in the bottom two lines of the 
tables. The differences between any two 
varietal averages in a column must be 
equal to or exceed the amounts found at 
the bottom of the table in order to be 
considered significant. 

The 1944 growing season was char- 
acterized by a marked deficiency of soil 
moisture during the boll maturation 
period. The lengths of the fast-fruiting 
cottons, Bobdel, Coker 100-8, and the 
Delfos strains, were affected more by dry 
weather than were the lengths of the 
slower maturing varieties. 

Good stands were obtained at all lo- 
cations. 

Stoneville Test 

The Stoneville test was located at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station and was 
conducted in cooperation with J. W. 
Whitaker, county agent of Washington 
County. The soil is a sandy loam typical 
of banks along upper Deer Creek. A 
nitrogenous fertilizer was "bedded-on" 
about 2 weeks before planting. The test 
was planted on April 25. The first pick- 



ing was made on August 29, and the 
second picking on October 6. Results of 
the Stoneville test are given in table 1. 

Stoneville 2B, Stoneville 2C, Deltapine 
14, Bobshaw 1, and Coker 100-8 were 
leading money value producers. 

Tunica Test 

In cooperation with Mrs. F. P. Farrell, 
landowner, and D. D. Gibson, county 
agent, a variety test was conducted in the 
northern part of the Delta in Tunica 
County, 1 mile south of Tunica on High- 
way 61. The soil is derived from Mis- 
sissippi alluvium and was classified as 
Dundee silt loam, or number 435, as de- 
scribed in the Tunica County soil sur- 
vey bulletin 381 of the Mississippi Ex- 
periment Station. A nitrogenous fertilizer 
was "bedded-on" prior to planting on 
May 17. Application of fertilizer and 
date of planting were delayed because of 
excessive spring rainfall. Seedlings did 
not emerge until June 4. The plants 
fruited unusually late. A first picking was 
made on October 10, a second picking on 
November 7, and a third picking on Janu- 
ary 20. The results of the Tunica test 
are given in table 2. 

Leading money value producers were 
Stoneville 2B, Deltapine 14, Coker 100- 
8, Delfos 531C, Bobshaw 1, and Stone- 
ville 2C. 

Money Test 

A test was conducted in Leflore Coun- 
ty, near Money, in cooperation with H. 
L. Gary, president of Wildwood, Inc., 
and J. S. McBee, county agent. The soil 
varies from a fine sandy loam to a silt 
loam, and an influence of outwash from 
the hills exists. It is fairly representative 
of the light soil of the Tallahatchie River 
Basin. A heavy growth of hairy vetch 
was turned under, and nitrogenous ferti- 
lizer was "bedded-on" before planting. 
After the cotton had been thinned and 
"worked out," it was side-dressed with 
20 pounds of nitrogen. The test was 
planted on May 2. The first and second 
pickings were made on September 7 and

COTTON VARIETY TESTS IN THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA 



9 



October 17, respectively. The results of 
the Money test are given in table 3. 

Highest money values were produced 
by Bobshaw 1, Stoneville 2B, Deltapine 

14, and Stoneville 2C. 

Heatfiman Test 

The Heathman test, in Sunflower 
County, was conducted in cooperation 
with W. J. Godbold, manager of Bob- 
shaw Chemurgic Plantation, and H. A, 
Carpenter, county agent. The field is 
located on Highway 82. The soil is a 
Hght-colored, well-drained silt loam. A 
heavy growth of hairy vetch was turned 
under and a nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded-on" before planting. The test 
was planted on May 10, and the first 
and second pickings were made on Sep- 
tember 22 and October 28. The results 
of the Heathman test are presented in 
table 4. 

Stoneville 2B, Bobshaw 1, Stoneville 
2C, and Deltapine 14 were leading money 
value producers. When comparions were 
based on low-grade cotton only. Miller 
was among the leading producers. When 
comparisons were based upon high-grade 
cotton only, Wilds was among leading 
producers. 

Valley Hill Test 

The Valley Hill test was conducted in 
cooperation with L. S. Hemphill, land- 
owner, and J. R. Haynes, county agent. 
The field is located in Carroll County 
about 6 miles east of Greenwood on 
Highway 82, and is on the eastern border 
of the Delta. The surface soil, although 
it contains some sand, is a light-colored, 
well-drained, silt loam made up largely 
of outwash from the hills. A nitrogen- 
ous fertilizer was "bedded-on" before 
planting. The plots were planted on May 

15. Boll rot was very bad, particularly 
on the Wilds 16 and Rowden (Roldo) 
plots. The first and second pickings were 
made on September 26 and November 6, 
respectively. The yield and other data 
from the Valley Hill test are given in 
table 5. 



Stoneville 2B and Deltapine 14 were 
the highest money value producers. 

Yazoo City Test 

In cooperation with Marx Schaefer, 
landowner, and A. R. Ruby, county 
agent, the variety test for the southeastern 
part of the Delta was conducted on the 
Schaefer farm 3 miles west of Yazoo 
City. The soil varies from a fine sandy 
to a silt loam and is v^-ell to medium 
well drained. A nitrogenous fertilizer 
was "bedded-on" and the test planted on 
May 11. The first and second pickings 
were made on September 14 and Novem- 
ber 1. The results of the Yazoo City test 
are given in table 6. 

Leading money value producers were 
Deltapine 14, Bobshaw 1, Stoneville 2B, 
Wilds 16, and Stoneville 2C. 

Kelso Test 

The Kelso test was conducted in co- 
operation with James Hand of Kelso 
Plantation and C. L. Cary, county agent 
of Sharkey County. The test is located 
on the Sharkey-Issaquena county line 11 
miles south of Cary on Highway 61. The 
soil is a very productive fine sandy loam 
derived from Mississippi alluvium and is 
typical of the Deer Creek soil of Sharkey, 
Issaquena, and Warren Counties. The 
test was planted on May 9. It is unique 
in that it is, as far as the Station staff 
knows, the first cotton variety test to be 
planted in check rows. The rows were 
40 inches apart each way and were cul- 
tivated with four-row equipment exclus- 
ively. Six plants were left in each hill. 
Very little rain fell during the growing 
season. Boll weevil infestations were very 
heavy, and the cotton was dusted several 
times. The first and second pickings 
were made on September 21 and October 
30, respectively. The yield and other 
data from the Kelso test are given in 
table 7. 

Highest money value producing vari- 
eties were Delfos 531C, Stoneville 2B, 
Coker 100-8, Delfos 651, and Bobshaw 1. 
Deltapine 14 was among the leading

money value producers when comparisons 
were based on low-grade cotton only. 

Combined Tests 

The average values for the yield and 
other data from the seven tests are given 
in table 8. While these averages supply 
general and interesting information, it 
should be borne in mind that there are 
limitations to their use. A farmer who 
grows cotton under a set of conditions 
similar to that under which a variety test 
at a certain location was conducted would 
obtain considerably more information for 
his own use by studying the performance 
of the various varieties at that location 
than he would by observing the average 
values obtained in the combined analy- 
ses of data from tests at seVeral locations. 
Yield and other data from the combined 
analyses of variety tests conducted at the 
seven locations are given in table 8. 

Stoneville 2B, Deltapine 14, and Bob- 
shaw 1 were leading money value pro- 
ducers. 

Summary 

Cotton variety tests were conducted in 
1944 by the Delta Branch Experiment 
Station at Stoneville, Tunica, Money, 
Heathman, Valley Hill, Yazoo City, and 
Kelso. 

Stoneville 2B and Deltapine 14 were 
among the top money value varieties at 
all locations. Stoneville 2C was one of 
the highe^ money producing strains at 
Stoneville, Tunica, Money, Heathman, 
and Yazoo City. Bobshaw 1 was in the 
top group in regard to money value at 
Stoneville, Tunica, Money, Heathman, 
Yazoo City, and Kelso. Coker 100-8 was 
one of the leading varieties at Tunica 
and Kelso. Delfos 53 IC led the other 
varieties at Kelso and was one of the top 
varieties at Tunica. Delfos 651 was one 
of the leading varieties at Kelso. When 
comparisons are based upon low-grade 



cotton only, Miller was one of the lead- 
ing varieties at Heathman. When com- 
parisons are based upon high-grade cot- 
ton only. Wilds 16 was one of the lead- 
ing varieties at Heathman and Yazoo 
City. When the money value data from 
the seven tests were analyzed in the com- 
bined analysis, it was found that Stone- 
ville 2B, Deltapine 14, and Bobshaw 1 
were leading money value producers. 

In the combined analyses, information 
was provided relative to the average 
staple length, earliness, fiber bundle 
strength, and fiber length uniformity for 
the 12 varieties. 

The staple lengths for most of the var- 
ieties were shorter than normal. Wilds 
16 was 1-1/4 inches long. Bobdel, Del- 
fos 444, Delfos 53 IC, Delfos 651, and 
Stoneville 2C were in the 1-3/32 to 1-1/8 
inch group. Bobshaw 1, Coker 100-8, 
Deltapine 14, and Stoneville 2B were in 
the 1-1/16 to 1-3/32 inch group. Miller 
and Rowden (Roldo) were in the 1 to 
1-1/32 inch group. 

The earliest cottons were Bobdel, Del- 
fos 531C, Delfos 444, Miller, and Delfos 
651. Late varieties were Deltapine 14, 
Wilds 16, and Rowden (Roldo), Stone- 
ville 2B and Stoneville 2C. 

Outstanding in fiber bundle strength 
were Wilds 16, Bobdel, and Bobshaw 1. 

The fiber length uniformity of Row- 
den (Roldo), Miller, Deltapine 14, Bob- 
shaw 1, and Bobdel were better than 
those of the other varieties included in 
the study. 

Two new features of these studies were 
the use of seed analyses in determining 
the money value produced by the re- 
spective varieties and the planting of the 
Kelso test in check rows. As far as the 
Delta Station staff knows, this is the first 
time that these features have been in- 
corporated in cotton variety tests.

WILD FLOWERS OF MISSISSIPPI 

By Ferris S. Batson and George W. Johnston 

Relatively few people appreciate the wealth of wild flowers 
found in Mississippi. The variation in soils, climate, and environ- 
ment provides suitable conditions for growth and development of a 
great variety of plants. Since there is such an abundance of na- 
tive materials well adapted to conditions in the State, a greater 
quantity of the more attractive wild flowers should be used in the 
home landscape. The value of native plants is often overlooked 
since poorly shaped, sparse-blooming plants usually result from 
growth in the woods in crowded places or poor soil. Cinderellas 
of the woods often change into princesses when brought into culti- 
vation. 

This bulletin has been prepared to help nature lovers and gar- 
deners identify wild flowers of the State and to encourage their use 
in landscape plantings. Although this publication lists relatively 
few of the native herbaceous plants, many of the species that are 
more desirable for cultivation have been described. 

TRANSPLANTING 

In transplanting from the woods, observation should be made 
as to the kind of soil in which each plant is growing, and the soil 
conditions should be duplicated whenever possible in setting plants 
in the landscape. Observe the fertility, type, and moisture content of 
soil. Also notice whether plants grow in sun, shade, or both sunny 
and shady situations. Success or failure in growing many wild flow- 
ers depends on whether or not the gardener follows this practice. The 
fact that many plants grow in a wide range of conditions should not 
be overlooked. 

Bulbous plants are generally transplanted more successfully 
after the blooming season when the foliage begins to turn yellow. 
Plants that have fibrous roots that grow near the surface are gen- 
erally easy to transplant at any time. Those that have sparsely 
branched roots growing deep into the soil are more difficult to 
transplant, and preferably plants having this kind of root system 
should be moved during fall or winter. Plants are often difficult 
to locate when not in bloom; however, these may be found if well 
marked with stakes or tags during the blooming season. If plants are 
moved during the blooming season it is usually desirable to cut off 
the tops a few inches above the surface of the ground so that the re- 
duced root system can supply the remaining leaves with water. 
Leave as much soil as possible around the roots when transplanting 
during the growing season. 

STARTING FROM SEEDS 

In many cases it is easier to establish plantings of wild flowers 
from seeds. Seeds should be collected from plants when mature 



4 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 417 



and dry, just before the reproductive structure containing the seeds 
opens releasing them. The chief difficulty in collecting seeds is in 
being able to find them at the right stage for gathering. 

When collected and cleaned, place the dry seeds in envelopes, 
seal, and label. Envelopes should then be placed in a glass jar 
which is free of moisture, and the jar kept closed. Keep in a cool 
place until time to plant. 

Seeds may be sown directly in the wild garden or cultivated 
garden. The soil where seeds are to be sown should be dug up, 
pulverized so as to be free of clods and the surface smoothed. Sow 
seeds on the surface and press gently into the soil with the shoe or 
a board. Fine seeds do not need covering. Larger seeds may be 
covered slightly (not more than 1/16 inch) with sifted sandy loam. 
September and October is the best time to sow seeds of most wild 
flowers. 

Higher percentages of seed germination may be had by starting 
seed in a seed flat as in handling many cultivated flower and vege- 
table seeds. 

CONSERVATION 

Promiscuous removal of native plants from the woods should 
not be tolerated. Plants should never be removed when located 
near a highway or farmstead. Respect the rights of others by al- 
ways asking permission of the owner before collecting flowers or 
plants on areas not frequented. 

BOTANICAL DESCRIPTIONS AND PLANT NAMES 

Botanical descriptions of plants have been written in non-tech- 
nical language so that high school students and amateurs can readily 
understand them. As far as possible only the conspicuous parts of 
the flowers, chiefly the petals and sepals, have been used in the de- 
scriptions of the flowers. The botanical descriptions have been sim- 
plified from the following publications: 

"Cyclopedia of Horticulture", by L. H. Bailey; "Illustrated 
Flora of Northern United States and Canada", by N. L. Britton and 
A. Brown; "Manual of Weeds", by Ada Georgia; "Manual of Bo- 
tany", by Asa Gray; and "Manual of Southeastern Flora", by J. K. 
Small. 

"Standardized Plant Names", second edition, has been followed 
in naming plants. Synonyms of common names are shown in 
bold face. 

EXPLANATION OF THE IDENTIFICATION KEY 

Only those plants described in this bulletin can be identified by 
the following key. In order that identifications can be made with- 
out detailed study, only readily observed characters of flowers, 
stems, and leaves are used. As far as possible, technical terms have 
either been omitted entirely or replaced by terms familiar to ev- 




Figure 1 — Leaf Characters

Pisk or tubular floujers 




Figure 2 — Flower Types 



eryone. Before attempting to use the key, one should carefully 
observe the drawings of leaf and flower types on pages 5 and 6. 

The key is based on a system of alternatives; i. e. for every set 
of positive descriptive characters there is an alternate set of nega- 
tive characters having the same number. Thus the plant in ques- 
tion must fit into one of two classes. This system can best be illus- 
trated by carrying a plant through the key. Suppose one is identi- 
fying the Birdsfoot Violet. Since it has a flower, it cannot be a 
fern; thus it belongs in Division II. The flowers are not in composite 
heads; therefore, one looks for the alternative which is the second 
1. The plants do not grow in water, therefore, it falls under the 
second 10. The flowers are not surrounded by a hooded tube; 
therefore, it falls under the second 12. The flowers are not divided 
into 3 or 6 parts; therefore, it falls under the second 13. The leaves 
are all from the base of the flower stalk; therefore, it falls under the 
first 27. The leaves are not hollow, trumpet-shaped, hooded; there- 
fore, it falls under the second 28. Then, by referring to the page 
indicated, a complete description and photograph of Birdsfoot Violet 
will be found. ,

DESCRIPTION OF PLANTS 

COMMON YARROW, Milfoil 

Achillea millefolium 

Although this perennial has been naturalized from Europe, it is 
so common in most localities that it appears to be native. Plants 
have been cultivated to some extent, particularly those producing 
pink blooms instead of the usual white flower. Found in many sec- 
tions of the State in sunny situations. Abandoned fields, pastures, 
woods, and dry hillsides are the places where it is most commonly 
found. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, 1 to 2V2 feet tall, nearly smooth to cobwebby-haired, 
sometimes forked toward top. Leaves alternate, dark-green, the 
lower ones finely divided, the upper ones less finely divided, shorter, 
and narrower than the lower ones; foilage strong-scented. Flower 
heads numerous, small, in dense flat-topped clusters, each flower 
head consisting of 5 to 12 white or pink rays surrounding a yellow- 
ish-white disk. Mid-spring, occasionally later. 

CANADA GARLIC 

Allium canadense 

A common bulbous perennial often found in large masses in 
southern part of State. Although the blooms are attractive it prob- 
ably would be rather difficult to eradicate in the cultivated garden. 
Grows in sandy soil in sun or partial shade. 

Stem lacking. Leaves few, arising at base of flower stalk, the 
blades flat, narrow, up to 10 inches long. Flowers produced in 
dense, flat-topped clusters on end of green, leafless, smooth flower- 
stalk, 8 to 20 inches tall; each flower consisting of six pink segments 
with a darker central stripe (midvein). April-May. 

CROW POISON. Flypoison 

Amianthium muscaetoxicum 

With care under cultivation this bulbous perennial is handsome 
during the blooming season. It is an excellent plant for sandy soil. 
Commonly found in the Longleaf Pine Area of South Mississippi. 
It prefers full sun or partial shade. Transplant bulbs in late sum- 
mer or fall. 

Stem erect, somewhat angled, 1 to 4 feet tall. Leaves grass-like, 
many at the base of the stem, few toward the top; the lower leaves 
long and flat, erect or arched, the upper ones much shorter and nar- 
rower. Flowers rather densely arranged along end of stem, each 
consisting of six spreading, white segments that gradually turn green 
with age; the lower, first-blooming flowers often green before the 
upper flowers open. April-May.

15 



WILLOW AMSONIA, Texas-star 
Amsonia tabernaemontana 

Although this perennial often makes a large attractive clump 
in the woods, it is much more handsome when given care. A desir- 
able plant for the wild garden and popular in the cultivated garden 
where it has been used. Several species found in the State are de- 
sirable for cultivation. Found in woods and along roadsides, in 
sunny or shady locations. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, 2 to 4 feet tall, usually branched toward top, par- 
tially covered with short hairs when young, smooth when mature. 
Leaves numerous, simple, alternate, smooth-margined or sotnetimes 
finely toothed or bristled on margins near tip, V^k to 6 inches long, 
usually lance-shaped with long tapering points, resembling willow 
leaves. Flowers in loose clusters along end of stem, five bluish 
petals united at their bases into a vase-shaped to funnel-shaped 
tube. April-May. 

INDIAN JACK-IN-THE-PULPIT, Indian Turnip 

Arisaema triphyllum 

An interesting perennial that is desirable for shady places in the 
wild garden. The leaves which arise from corms each spring wither 
and die in summer leaving stalks of bright red fruits. Commonly 
found in various parts of the State in moist hillsides, thickets, and 
swamps. Transplant corms in late summer and fall. 

Stem lacking. Leaves only one or two, erect or nearly so on 
long petioles 1 to 3 feet tall, the blade divided into three to five egg- 
shaped, short-pointed segments, pale green on lower surface, darker 
on upper surface. Flowers small, inconspicuous, crowded on the 
basal portion of a green, club-shaped structure (spadix) enclosed by 
a green or green and purple-striped, leaflike, tube with a pointed 
hood or flap arched over the top (spathe). April. • 

COMMON MILKWEED 

Asclepias syriaca 

This plant is somewhat coarse to be used extensively in the land- 
scape; however, the rose colored blooms are quite handsome. A 
perennial rarely cultivated. Found in rich soil, usually bottomland, 
in various parts of the State. Probably somewhat difficult to trans- 
plant. 

Stem erect, stout, 2 to 5 feet tall, usually unbranched, downy 
when young, smooth when mature. Leaves opposite, simple, short- 
petioled, IV2 to 4 inches wide, 2V2 to 8 inches long, oblong-lance- 
shaped to broadly oval, downy on lower surface, smooth on upper 
surface, the margin slightly rough with short bristly hairs. Flowers 
numerous in clusters on end of stem and axillary flower stalks; each 
flower consisting of five greenish-purple or pinkish spreading or 
downward-pointing petals surrounding an erect, five-pointed, pur- 
plish or pink crown. May-June.

Figure 9 — Butterfly Milkweed 



BUTTERFLY MILKWEED, Butterfly Weed 

Asclepias tuberosa 

The Butterflyweed, as it is commonly called, is truly too lovely 
to be called a weed. This plant, which produces one of the most 
conspicuous flowers found in the State, usually grows in full sun. 
It is found more abundantly in open fields and dry banks where the 
soil contains considerable lime. The roots are somewhat similar to 
a tuber and grow relatively deeply into the soil. Worthy of wider 
use as a cultivated plant. It produces seeds rather freely and vol- 
unteer seedlings are usually to be found each year where plants are 
grown in cultivated gardens. Deep rooted and rather difficult to 
transplant except in winter. 

Stem erect or sometimes bent, 1 to 3 feet tall, round, roughish- 
hairy, leafy, branched toward top. Leaves alternate, entire, wavy- 
margined, oblong to lance-shaped, hairy on both sides, sessile or 
short-petioled. Flowers numerous, in large, flat-topped, bright- 
orange clusters on ends of branches, each consisting of five down- 
ward-pointing petals and a five-parted, erect crown. May-July.

WHITE MILKWEED 

Asclepias variegata 

Although this perennial has rarely been used in the cultivated 
garden, it should be satisfactory for this purpose. The white flow- 
ers are unusually attractive. Found in dry woods and bottomland 
in sunny or shady situations. Widely distributed over the State. 

Slem erect, 1 to 3 feet tall, smooth or soft-hairy toward top, 
usually unbranched. Leaves opposite, simple, 1 to 2 inches wide, 
2 to 5 inches long, short-petioled, oval to egg-shaped, smooth on both 
surfaces, the margin slightly rough. Flowers numerous in dense 
clusters on end of stem and flower stalks; each flower consisting of 
five white petals surrounding an erect, five-parted, white crown 
with a purplish base. May-June.

NEW ENGLAND ASTER 

Aster novae-angliae 

This short-day perennial that blooms as the day length becomes 
short in the fall, is one of the most attractive of the many native 
asters. It is found in rich damp soil, fields, edges of thickets, and 
swamps. Grows in either sunny or shady places. Desirable for the 
wild garden. Easily transplanted. , 

Stem erect, stout, 2 to 8 feet tall, branched toward top, covered 
with bristly hairs. Leaves numerous, alternate, lance-shaped, 
dark-green, smooth-margined, covered with soft hairs, clasping stem 
at attachment point, 2 to 4V2 inches long. Flower heads numerous 
in clusters on tips of stem and branches; each head composed of 40 
to 60 lorg, narrow, violet-purple (sometimes rose or white) rays 
surrounding an orange-yellow to reddish-brown disk. Fall. 

SAVORYLEAF ASTER 

Aster (lonactis) linariifolius 

A rather low growing, free blooming perennial that probably 
would make a desirable subject for the cultivated f^arden. Usually 
found in sunny places in dry acid woods, exposed hillsides and pine- 
lands. It occurs in most parts of the State. Apparently easily 
transplanted. 

Stem erect, rough-hairy, leafy, Vi to 2 feet tall. Leaves alter- 
nate, small, narrow, rough-margined, thickly arranged along stem. 
Flower heads few or only one on end of stem; several violet or white, 
spreadirg, somewhat drooping rays surrounding a yellow disk. Fall. 

MILKVETCH, Loco, Rattlevetch, Poisonvetch 

Astragnlus carolinianus 

Since this perennial is very difficult to transplant, it is one of 
the native nlants to be enjoyed only in the woods. This plant usually 
makes a large clump and blooms profusely. Widelv distributed 
throughout the State, more often found in sunny places in dry 
woods. 

Stem erect, 1 to 4 feet tall, smooth or partially covered with 
hairs. Leaves alternate, compound, leaflets 13 to 27, 3/4 to IV2 
inches long. Flowers numerous, closely packed along leafless end 
of stem, greenish cream-color, resembling pea blossoms in shape. 
April-May.

ATLANTIC WILDINDIGO, White Wildindigo, Prairie Indigo 

Baptisia leucanta 

One of the wild flowers that is valuable in landscape plantings 
for its interesting foliage as well as its attractive flowers. Plants 
allowed to grow undisturbed for several years become shrub-like 
in size. It is widely distributed throughout the State, occurring in 
prairies, pinelands, woods, and river banks. Apparently it is well 
adapted to most well-drained soils. Found in sunny or partially 
shaded places. Although it has a relatively large root system, it may 
be transplanted easily. Volunteer plants usually appear in spring 
where plants are grown in cultivated areas. 

Stem stout, up to 4y2 feet tall, smooth, often covered with whit- 
ish bloom; branches numerous, upward-curving. Leaves alternate, 
compound, leaflets usually three, dark-green, 11/2 to IV2. inches long, 
oblong-wedge-shaped, rounded on end. Flowers rather loosely 
arranged along leafless ends of stems, white in color, resembling 
garden pea blossoms in shape. April-May. 

ATLANTIC CAMAS 
Camassia scilloides 

The delicate, blue, unique flowers of this bulbous perennial is 
exceedingly attractive, particularly where masses of them are found 
in abandoned fields and fence rows. Unusually satisfactory for the 
cultivated or wild garden. Suitable for sunnv or shady situations. 
Found in thickets and meadows in Central Prairie and Northeast 
Prairie, possibly elsewhere. Preferably transplant bulbs in fall. 

Stem lacking. Leaves all basal from an underground bulb, the 
blades long, narrow, ridged on back like the keel of a boat. Flowers 
small, many, produced along the end of an erect flower stalk 6 to 28 
inches tall, the flower stalk leafless except for small, leaf-like bracts; 
each flower consisting of six blue, spreading segments (sepals and 
petals). May. 

OXEYEDAISY, White Daisy 
Chrysanthemum leucanthemum 

A plant that was widely distributed through the Southern 
States during the Civil War and now grows wild in many sections 
of the State. A perennial that is often called Shasta Daisy because 
of the similarity of the two plants. Frequentlv used in yards and 
gardens. Found more often in sun or partial shade in fields, road- 
sides, woods, and waste-places. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, slender, 1 to 3 feet tall, simple or forked toward top, 
nearly smooth. Leaves of lower portion in a mat around base of 
stem, rounded on end, gradually tapering toward base in outline, the 
blade divided and irregularly toothed; middle and upper leaves 
narrowly oblong, sessile, regularly toothed toward tip with large 
spreading teeth toward base. Flower heads single on end of stalk, 
about 2 inches wide, with 20 to 30 spreading, white rays surrounding 
a yellow di^k, May-June,

VIRGINIA SPRINGBEAUTY, Springbeauty, Roseelf 

Claytonia virginica 

One of the daintiest of native perennials, it breaks into bloom 
quickly during the first warm days of spring. Even though the in- 
dividual blooms are small the profusion of flowers often produced 
in large colonies of plants makes a show that reminds one of fairy- 
land. Widely distributed throughout the State in woods, fields, and 
roadsides. Useful in rock gardens or as an edging plant in the cul- 
tivated garden. It is always at home in the wild garden. The corm 
(bulbous-like root) should be transplanted in summer or fall. 

Stem simple, weak, 2 to 8 inches high. Leaves only two in num- 
ber, opposite, narrow, elongated. Flowers loosely arranged along 
upper part of stem, each consisting of five rose-color petals with 
darker vines; one or two small, green, leaf-like bracts usually present 
at base of flower stalks. March-April. 

BIGFLOWER COREOPSIS, Tickseed 

Coreopsis grandiflora 

Species of Coreopsis are commonly grown in cultivated gardens 
throughout the South. This perennial is found in many parts of 
Central and North Mississippi. Usually found in dry soil in woods 
and fields exposed to full sun. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, smooth, 1 to 2 feet tall, simple or branched toward 
top. Leaves opposite, those of lower stem either lance-shaped or 
gradually widened from narrow base to a round point, usually en- 
tire, sometimes lobed; upper leaves divided into three to five parts, 
each part having two to three lobes. Flowers borne in showy heads 
on ends of stem and branches, each head consisting of several (usu- 
ally about eight) lobed, yellow rays surrounding a brownish disk. 
May-June. 

LARKSPUR 

Delphinium species 

This wild flower is quite similar to the common cultivated del- 
phiniums and would be desirable for the cultivated garden or for cut 
flowers. Apparantly it is an annual. Found on dry lands, hill- 
sides, and limestone soil in Northeast Mississippi. Grows best in 
full sun. 

Stem erect, 1 to 3 feet tall, simple or sometimes branches, smooth 
or covered with soft, short, sometimes sticky hairs. Leaves alter- 
nate, somewhat finely divided into narrow, thread-like or wider, 
lance-shaped segments. Flowers produced on individual stalks, 
alternately arranged along the upper part of the stem; each flower 
consisting of five, petal-like, spreading outer segments, the upper 
one prolonged into a spur at back (sepals) and two or four smaller, 
inner, hairy-tipped segments (petals); flowers blue, bluish-purple or 
sometimes almost white. April-June.

PURPLE ECHINACEA, Purple Coneflower, Black-sampson 

Red-sunflower 

Echinacea purpurea 

A perennial that is somewhat similar to the coneflower except 
the flowers are purplish in color. Cultivated to some extent. Us- 
ually found in sun or partial shade. Occurs in rich soil, woods, and 
fields. More common in Northeastern Mississippi. Easily trans- 
planted in fall as the last flowers are fading. Under cultivation, 
seedlings usually appear near the mother plants in the spring. 

Stem erect, slender, 2 to 4 feet tall, rough-bristly, usually un- 
branched. Leaves alternate (sometimes opposite on lower part of 
stem) dark-green, rough, 3 to 8 inches long, broadest toward base, 
tapering toward point; the lower ones petioled and toothed, the up- 
per ones sessile and smooth-margined. Flower heads produced 
singly on ends of naked stems with 12 to 20 dull-purple, drooping 
rays surrounding a deep-purple, cone-shaped disk. July-October. 

YELLOW FRINGEORCHID, Orange Plume 
Habenaria ciliaris 

One of the more common native orchids in this State, particu- 
larly in the Longleaf Pine and Central Plain Areas. The flowers 
which are produced on long stems are particularly desirable for 
cutflower arrangement but it is doubtful that the plants could be 
transplanted to the garden to be grown under cultivation. Found 
in acid bogs, meadows and open woods. 

Stem erect, slender, 1 to 2V2 feet tall, often slightly zigzag. 
Leaves alternate, oblong or lance-shaped, clasping stem at attach- 
ment point; up to 8 inches long at base of stem, much shorter to- 
ward top. Flowers many, orange or yellow, showy, somewhat 
crowded along the end of the stem, each flower consisting of six 
parts in two series of three parts each; two lower lateral segments 
of the outer series bent backward, the upper middle segment curved 
forward, somewhat hood-fashion; two upper lateral segments of 
inner series narrow, toothed at top, and lower middle segment or lip 
wider and fringed, prolonged into a spur at back. August. 

CRIMSONEYE, Rosemallow 

Hibiscus oculiroseus 

Several species of the rosemallows are common throughout the 
State. This group of plants produce large showy blooms during 
summer; however, the plants are rather coarse and weedy for use in 
the garden. Found in marshes and along roadsides in parts of Cen- 
tral and North Mississippi. Appears to grow best in sunny situa- 
tions. 

Stem erect, leafy, 3 to 6 feet tall. Leaves alternate, simple, egg-

shaped or lance-shaped, long, tapering, irregularly toothed, long-pet- 
ioled. Flowers large, showy, produced in cluster at tip of stem, 
each consisting of five white petals with a crimson blotch at base. 
June-August. 

KEYS HYMENOCALLIS, Spiderlily 

Hymenocallis keyensis 

A bulbous perennial with showy white flowers that deserves a 
more prominent place in cultivated gardens. Usually found along 
banks of streams and swamps w^here soil is well drained. Several 
similar species are found in the State. It grows well in sun or shade. 
Bulbs should be dug, divided and transplanted in summer when the 
foliage turns brown following the flowering period. 

Stem lacking. Leaves all from base of flower stalk, erect or 
arching, up to 32 inches tall, smooth, green, strap-shaped with blunt 
tips, the ed^es turned upward to form a channel or trough down the 
middle of the leaf. Flowers 10 to 16 in a cluster on top of a some- 
what flattened, sharp-edged flower stalk; each flower consisting of 
an elongated tube divided toward the top into six, rather narrow, 
white, spreading, drooping segments (sepals and petals) surround- 
ing an erect, white, six-angled crown 1 to 1% inches wide; six 
stalks, 2 to 2V2 inches tall, with T-shaped, yellow tops (stamens) pro- 
jecting above the six sections of the crown. April-May. 

COPPER IRIS 

Iris fulva 

One of the most attractive species of native irises. It has been 
used to some extent in wild and cultivated gardens of this State. 
Found in swamps, marshes, bayou banks, and ditches. It seems to 
thrive best in shady or partially shady situations. Preferably it 
should be transplanted in late summer or early fall, although it may 
be moved during the blooming season if handled with care. 

Stem erect, stout, IV2 to 4 feet tall, round or angled on one side, 
often slightly zigzag. I,eaves erect, sword-shaped, mostly from base 
of stem, usually shorter than flower stalk. Flowers showy, consist- 
ing of six bluish-purple to copper-colored or reddish-brown notched 
segments, the outer three spreading, dropping, the inner three about 
two-thirds as long as the outer, not quite so spreading or drooping. 
April-May. 

BLUEFLAG IRIS, Larger Blueflag 
Iris versicolor 

One of the most widespread irises in the South. Like many 
ppeHes of iris, it is found in marshes, swamps, meadows, and stream 
ban' s in frH <^'ir cr shad^^ places. In wet soil v-here few flowers 
thrive, this plant grows best. The rhizomes (roots) which grow 
just beneath the surface send up leaves to form new plants until

eventually the plants spread to make large masses. It may be 
transplanted easily at any season, but early fall is preferable. 

Stem erect, 1 to 3 feet tall, stout, round or sometimes angled on 
one side, often branched toward top. Leaves erect, sword-shaped, 
mostly on lower part of stem, shorter than flower stalks. Flowers 
several, showy, consisting of six segments united at their base to 
form a tube, the outer three segments turned downward, violet-blue 
with yellow, green, and white stripes toward the base, the inner 
three segments shorter and narrower, violet-blue except for a green- 
ish-yellow base. April -May. 

SPIKE GAYFEATHER 

Liatris spicata 

Due to its attractive flower spike, excellent keeping quality, and 
long stem, the various species of Gayfeather are frequntly used in 
floral arrangements. Often grown in the cultivated garden. Per- 
ennial. Usually found in sun or partial shade. The many similar 
species are widely distributed over the State in prairies, moist woods, 
and low pinelands. Transplant the tuberous-like roots in fall and 
winter. 

Stem erect, IV2 to 5 feet tall, smooth or somewhat hairy, stout, 
leafy. Leaves alternate, long, narrow, stiff, not divided or toothed. 
Flower heads numerous, thickly arranged along end of stem; each 
head composed of 8 to 12 small rose-purple, five-parted tube-shaped 
or funnel-shaped flowers; each small flower surrounded by a ring 
of erect bristles; the flower head surrounded by close-fitting, scale- 
leaf-like bracts (involucre). Summer. 

CARDINALFLOWER, Lobelia 

Lobelia cardinalis 

Often illustrated and listed in seed and nursery catalogues, this 
is a plant that has frequently found its place in the cultivated gar- 
den as a conspicuous summer-blooming plant. A perennial that 
erows equally well in sunny or shady places. Usually found in rich 
bottomland, swamps, and on banks of streams. Occurs rather in- 
freauently over a wide area of Central and North Mississippi. 
Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, 1 to 4 feet tall, unbranched, smooth or slightly hairy. 
Leaves alternate, simple, oblong, largest toward middle, tapering 
toward end, 2 to 6 inches long, the upper leaves smaller than the 
lower. Flowers looselv arranged along end of stem, bright-red, 
tube-shaped at base, divided into two lips at top, the upper lip erect, 
narrow, two-lobed, the lower lip drooping, spreading, three-lobed. 
June-August.

SUNDIAL LUPINE, Wild Lupine 

Lupinus perennis 

One of the more attractive native perennials that is often used 
in the cultivated garden. Not widely distributed over the State, 
but occasionally found in open woods, fields, and roadsides in acid, 
sandy soil in southeastern part of State. Apparently prefers sunny 
locations. 

Stem, erect, 8 to 24 inches tall, stout and succulent, slightly 
hairy, often branched. Leaves palmately compound, 7 to 11 leaf- 
lets arising from a central point, leaflets narrow at base gradually 
widening to a rounder or blunt point, the midrib extending beyond 
the tip as a small, bristly point. Flowers numerous, loosely arrang- 
ed on a long, terminal stalk, the purplish-blue or white blossoms re- 
sembling those of peas in shape. April. 

LADY-LUPINE, Hairy Lupine 

Lupinus villosus 

This annual is one of the few plants that ^rows luxuriantly on 
the most barren waste land in the Longleaf Pine and Coastal Plain 
Areas of South Mississippi. It is not uncommon alonf? barren high- 
wav banks where other plants are unable to survive. Usually found 
ir> full sun. Plants cannot be transplanted successfullv. To grow in 
the garden, gather seeds as soon as the pods dry and sow in late sum- 
mer or early fall where the plants are to grow. 

Stem and branches close together at top of root, often spread- 
ing? in all directions and lyinf? flat on the ground except for erect 
flower stalks on their tips. Leaves simple, ei^tire, hairy, IV2 to 6 
inches long, usually widest toward middle, .gradually tapering to- 
ward ends, long-petioled. Flowers numerous on erect terminal 
stalks, deep-lilac or purple, resembling the flower of the garden pea 
in shape. March-April.

YELLOW FALSEGARLIC, Gracegarlic 

Nothoscordum bivalve 

A bulbous perennial, rarely cultivated, that blooms in early 
spring. Usually occurs in colonies. Found in fields, open woods, 
and prairies. Rather widely distrbuted throughout the State. 

Stem (flower stalk) slender, 4 to 12 inches tall, leafless. Leaves 
long and narrow, grass-like, from the base of the stem, generally not 
extending above the flowers. Flowers few, borne singly on ends 
of short individual stalks which are grouped on end of main stalk, 
each consisting of six greenish-white or yellowish-white petal-like 
segments; two dry, papery scales on main stalk at base of individual 
flower stalks. March. 

MEADOW SUNDROP 

Oenothera pratensis 

A rather showy perennial that is attractive for its bright yel- 
low flowers in summer and fall. Found in low ground, woods, and 
prairies in parts of North Mississippi. Well adapted to sunny situa- 
tions. Apparently it reseeds readily and probably would be easily 
transplanted. 

Stem erect, 1 to 3 feet tall, covered with long hairs, often zig- 
zag between leaves. Leaves alternate, simple, oblong-lance-shaped, 
hairy on both surfaces, more or less wavy-margined. Flowers pro- 
duced toward top of stem on stalks arising from leaf axils, each con- 
sisting of four yellow, notched, somewhat showy petals. Summer- 
fall. 

SHOWY PRIMROSE, Evening Primrose 

Oenothera speciosa 

The primrose is so abundant in certain sections of the State that 
it has been susfgested that one of the highways should be called the 
Primrose Trail. This annual is usually found in large masses of- 
ten blanketing acres of land. Occurs usually in open fields and 
roadsides. It is more abundant in soils containing considerable 
lime. Reseeds readily and is likely to become a weed when intro- 
duced into cultivated areas. 

Stem mostly erect, 8 to 20 inches tall, covered with tiny, soft 
hairs. Leaves alternate, simple, variously shaped in outline: ob- 
long, lance-shaped, round at tip and narrowed toward bottom or 
long and narrow with parallel edges; leaf blades more or less deeply 
wavy-toothed. Flowers showy, borne singly on end of stem, con- 
sisting of four white or rose-colored, fan-shaped, slightly-indented 
petals. April-May.

GOLDENCLUB, Neverwet, Waterdock 

Orontium aquaticum 

The dark green foliage and the contrasting color of the unique, 
yellow, club-like flowers makes this one of the more attractive wa- 
ter plants. It is particularly common in shallow streams in the 
southern part of the State. Found in shady or sunny places in 
streams, ponds, and swamps in many parts of the State. 

Stem lacking. Leaves arising from a deeply-buried rootstock, 
oblong, long-petioled, smooth-margined, 4 to 12 inches long, bluish- 
green in color. Flowers numerous, small, scale-like, compactly 
arranged on the end of the flower stalk forming a golden-yellow, 
elongate, tapering structure (spadix). Spring. 

CINNAMON-FERN 

Osmunda cinnamomea 

The native ferns are soms of the best subjects for the wild 
garden. The Cinnamon Fern, which is widely distributed over the 
State, is one of the most attractive. Suitable for planting in moist 
or wet places. Best adapted to shady situations. Easily trans- 
planted. 

Leaves of two kinds, sterile leaves 2 to 5 feet tall, with alter- 
nate or opposite branches (pinnae) each divided into numerous ob- 
long, short, round-tipped, connected segments (pinnules); fertile 
leaves shorter, without leaflets, bearing clusters of cinnamon-col- 
ored structures (sporangia) along upper portion of stalk; fertile 
leaves appearing earlier than sterile and soon withering; both kinds 
of leaves covered with rusty wool, especially when young. 

PENSTEMON, Beard-tongue 

Penstemon species 

There are many native species of Penstemon in the State that are 
similar. Although the flowers are interesting in form, the colors 
are not popular. Usually found in open fields and meadows in full 
sun or partial shade. Occurs in various sections of the State. Easily 
transplanted. 

Stem erect, unbranched, smooth or soft-hairy, green to purple 
in color, 1 to 4 feet tall. Leaves opposite, the basal ones petioled, the 
others sessile or clasping, egg-shaped, lance-shaped, or heart-shaped 
at base, tapering toward point, shallowly-toothed or smooth-mar- 
gined. Flowers in small clusters on stalks arising from axils of up- 
per leaves, each flower inflated, two-lipped, white to purplish tube; 
the upper lip two-parted, the lower three-parted; the entire inflores- 
cense often glandular-hairy. April-May.

WILD FLOWERS IN MISSISSIPPI 



37 



SWEETWILLIAM PHLOX, Blue Phlox 

Phlox divaricata 

This species of phlox has probably been used more than other 
native phloxes in the cultivated garden. The flowers of this species 
are more consistently bluish in color than any other phlox. Found 
in many parts of Central and North Mississippi. More often it oc- 
curs in rich bottomlands in shady or partially shady places. Excel- 
lent for the cultivated or wild garden. Easily transplanted. 

Stems spreading with erect tips or flower shoots up to 20 inches 
tall. Leaves opposite, entire, sessile or nearly so, lance- or egg- 
shaped, the lower ones sometimes evergreen; entire plant usually 
covered with fine, sticky hairs. Flowers in flat-topped, loosely-ar- 
ranged clusters, five fragrant, bluish or occasionally lilac petals 
with faintly violet-striped eye or center spot. April-May. 

SMOOTH PHLOX 

Phlox glaberrima 

This perennial is somewhat similar to other phloxes and should 
find a place in the garden as a relatively tall-growing plant that 
blooms in late spring and early summer. Found in many sections 
of the State in open woods and along roadsides. It is better to col- 
lect these plants during the blooming season, since the color of flow- 
ers differs and the more desirable colors may be selected. Easily 
transplanted. 

Stems erect, smooth, up to 3 feet tall. Leaves opposite, numer- 
ous and crowded on lower part of stem, thinner on upper part, elon- 
gate to lance-shaped, up to 6 inches long; smooth except around the 
edge which is rough and often rolled backward. Flowers in loosely 
arranged clusters. Petals pinkish-purple to whitish, the eye or cen- 
ter spot faintly striped. May-June. 

DOWNY PHLOX, Sweetwilliam 
Phlox pilosa 

An attractive perennial that is one of the earliest wild flowers 
to bloom in spring. Although plants usually produce few flowers 
in the woods, it blooms profusely when cultivated. This is one of 
the most desirable wild flowers for the garden. Found abundantly 
throughout most of the State in open woods thickets, barrens, pra- 
iries, and hammocks. Adapted to sunny or shady situations. Easily 
transplanted even at blooming time. Under cultivation volunteer 
seedlings are usually to be found each spring. 

Stems slender, erect or nearly so, up to 2 feet tall, usually hairy. 
Leaves opposite or alternate, sessile, usually covered with soft hairs 
on top and bottom surfaces, 1 to 4 inches long, widest at base, tap- 
ering to a long, rather sharp point. Flowers in a terminal cluster, 
each consisting of five petals, either purple, pink, or white, with 
sometimes a purple-striped eye or center spot. March-May.

FALSE DRAGONHEAD, Obedient Plant 

Physostegia denticulata 

A perennial that is found in many sections of the State in var- 
ious types of soil. The orchid colored varieties of False Dragonhead 
are often grown in cultivated gardens. It more often occurs in 
open fields, but it is fourd also in low woods and thickets. Easily 
transplanted in spring, fall or winter. 

Stem erect, square, smooth, IV2 to 4 feet tall, simple or branched 
into flower stalks at top. Leaves opposite, simple, sessile, oblong 
with rather blunt tip, regularly toothed completely around margin; 
leaves becoming? fewer and smaller from base to top of stem. 
Flowers rather loosely arranged along ends of branches, each an in- 
flated tube divided at the top into two lips. The upper lip entire, 
the lower three-lobed, the middle lobe larger than the other two 
and notched; flowers purplish-pink to white. May-June. 

COMMON MAY APPLE, Umbrellaleaf , Wild Mandrake 

Podophyllum peltatum 

The umbrella-like leaves of this perennial is one of the first 
wild flowers to make its appearance in spring. It usually grows in 
moist shady places in swamps and banks of streams where it is 
more often found in large masses. Found in most parts of the State. 
The fleshv root is a violent purgative and is said to be poisonous. 
The roots are easily transplanted avd rapidlv spread into large 
clumps under favorable conditions. Well adapted to the shady 
places in the wild garden. 

Stem of two kinds: flowerless stem erect, 1 to IV2 feet high with 
one large leaf at its tip; flower stem erect with two leaves forked 
from top. Leaf of flowerless stem lar^e, centrally attached, um- 
brella-like, coarselv divided into five to nine lobes, each lobe further 
divided into two coarsely toothed parts; leaves of flower stem not 
centrally attached, one-sided, divided and toothed as leaf of flow- 
erless stem. Flower borne on a nodding stalk attached usually in 
fork of leaves; six to nine white petals, fragrant. April. 

SMALL SOLOMONSEAL 

Polygonatum biflorum 

A perennial that is more attractive for its foliage than flowers. 
A particularly fine subject for the wild garden. Occurs in various 
parts of the State in moist thickets, woods along streams, and on 
bottomlands. It seems to prefer shady places. The thick, hori- 
zontal, jointed rootstocks are easily transplanted in fall or winter. 
Plants usually form large clumps under cultivation. 

Stem arched, 8 to 36 inches tall, round, smooth, unbranched, 
leafless at bottom. Leaves alternate or opposite, simple, entire, 
oblong or egg-shaped, 2 to 6 inches long, dark-green on top, pale on

bottom, sessile or partly clasping the stem at attached point. Flow- 
ers inconspicuous, small, one to two nodding on each axillary flower 
stalk, each flower consisting of a whitish-green tube divided into 
six short lobes at top. April. 

WESTERN BRACKEN 

Pteridium aquilinum 

Although most of the ferns grow best in moist shady places, this 
is one that is well adapted to dry sunny locations. Widely distrib- 
uted in the State. Usually found in open woods and along dry 
banks. Easily transplanted. 

Leaves generally in threes from the summit of an erect, stout 
stalk, 8 to 36 inches tall; each leaf divided into many branches 
(pinnae); the lowermost branches wide-spreading, with numerous 
deeply-lobed leaflets (pinnules); the middle, and part of the upper, 
branches shorter, with undivided or unlobed leaflets; the top-most 
part of the leaf unbranched, the branches giving way to undivided, 
short, leaflet-like segments. 

BLACKEYEDSUSAN, Yellow Daisy, Coneflower, Niggarhead 

Rudbeckia hirta 

There are many species of coneflower which are abundant 
throughout the State. Although these are often a weed, the beauty 
of masses of yellow blooms is worthy of mention and these plants 
are among the more abundant species of wild flowers of the State. 
An annual rarely used in cultivated gardens. Usually found in sun 
along roadsides, in fields and woods. 

Stems erect, rather stout, rough-bristly-hairy, 1 to 3 feet tall, 
simple or branched toward bottom. Leaves alternate, thick, hairy, 
oblong, smooth-margined or sparingly toothed; the lower ones 2 to 7 
inches long, petioled; the upper ones shorter, narrower, sessile and 
clasped around the stem at attachment point. Flower heads few to 
several on end of main stem and on branches arising from axils of 
upper leaves, very showy, 2 to 4 inches broad, with about 14 bril- 
liant orange rays surrounding a brownish-purple, cone-shaped disk. 
April-June,

LIMESTONE RUELLIA 

Ruellia strepens 

Although this plant has only one or two flowers open at one 
time, it blooms over a relatively long period. A perennial that is 
well adapted to the shady garden, l- ound usually in rich bottom- 
land in many parts of the State. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, square, 1 to 4 feet tall, smooth or sparingly soft- 
hairy. Leaves opposite, simple, petioled, 2 to 6 inches long, oblong 
to egg-shaped, usually widest toward middle, tapering toward both 
ends. Flowers produced singly on stalks arising in axil of middle 
and upper leaves, each stalk with two small opposite leaves just be- 
low the flower; each flower funnel-shaped, iy4 to 2 inches long; 
the lower part of the funnel small, very pale or whitish, the upper 
part inflated and divided into five, blue or bluish-purple segments, 
April-June. 

SQUARESTEM RCSE-GEKTIAN, Rosepink, Bitierbloom 

Sabatia angularis 

An annual which is very conspicuous in the woods when in 
bloom. Usually grows where soil is poor in woods thickets and 
meadows. 

Stem erect, 4-angled, 1 to 3 feet high, with numerous opposite 
branches toward top. Leaves opposite, simple, not toothed or divid- 
ed, egg-shaped, sessile with clasping bases. Flowers produced on 
ends of branches with four to five pink petals having a yellowish or 
greenish eye; fragrant. Summer. 

ROSE-GENTIAN 

Sabatia brachiata 

This small-flowered plant is rather conspicuous in bloom. Ap- 
parently it is an annual. It should be a very satisfactory garden 
flower; however, it would have to be grown from seeds. Found in 
many sections of the State in moist soil. Suitable for sunny or 
shady situations. 

Stem erect, 1 to 2 feet tall, smooth, slightly angled, branched 
toward top. Leaves opposite, sessile, entire, somewhat heart-shaped 
at base, tapering to a rounded point, the upper branch leaves some- 
what reduced. Flowers produced on ends of branches arising from 
axils of upper leaves, each consisting of five spreading, rose-pink 
petals united at their base into a short tube. June-July.

45 



TRUMPET PITCHERPLANT, Flytrap, Adam's-pitcher 

Devil's Boots, Forefather's Cup 

Sarracenia flava 

This perennial has not been cultivated and likely it is not suit- 
able for the garden. The showy yellow flowers that appear in early 
spring are followed by foliage that has the appearance of a pitcher, 
hence its name. Usually found in meadows, bogs, and marshes. 

Stem lacking. Leaves erect, 1 to SVz feet tall, hollow, gradually 
expanding from the base upward to form a trumpet-shaped, winged 
structure with a hood at top; the hood sometimes yellow with red- 
dish veins. Flowers produced singly on ends of smooth, leafless, 
nodding flower stalks; each flower consisting of an outer series of 
five segments, IV2 to 2 inches long, widest in middle and rounded on 
end (sepals) and an inner series of five drooping, somewhat fiddle- 
shaped, yellow petals, 21/2 to 4 inches long, overhanging a globose of 
"biscuit shaped", yellowish center. Early Spring. 

HYSSOP SKULLCAP 

Scutellaria integrifolia 

Several species of skullcap that are somewhat similar are found 
in various parts of the State. Although the group of plants is not 
striking, many of them are desirable for late spring blooming in the 
garden. Usually found in sun or partial shade in dry soil. Occurs 
in most parts of State. 

Stem erect, square, 6 to 24 inches tall, branched above middle, 
covered with short, soft, gland-tipped hairs, specially toward top. 
Leaves opposite, the lower ones petioled with oval to egg-shaped, 
toothed blades; the upper ones sessile with smaller, smooth-margined 
blades of varying shapes. Flowers oppositely arranged along the 
end of stem and branches, one arising from the axil of each of the 
reduced leaves; each flower consisting of a curved tube inflated to- 
ward the top and divided into two lips, the upper lip hood-shaped, 
the lower spreading, notched in center; flowers pale-blue or pale- 
violet except for white streaks in center of lower lip and on lower 
surface of tube. May-June. 

FIREPINK SILENE, Catchfly 
Silene virginica 

Because of the firey red color of the flowers of this perennial, it 
is one of the easiest wild flowers to find in the woods during the 
blooming season. Found rather sparingly in the woods. A satis- 
factory plant to use in the cultivated garden. Usually occurs in op- 
en woods in sunny or shady situations. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, slender, 8 to 24 inches tall, enlarged at joints, covered 
with short, soft, clammy hairs. Leaves opposite, entire, thin, mostly

rounded at tip and narrowing toward base, sometimes oblong-lance- 
shaped, 2 to 8 inches long. Flowers few, loosely arranged, with five 
oblong, deep-scarlet, two-parted petals extending from a cylinder- 
shaped or club-shaped base. May-June. 

COMMON BLUE-EYEDGRASS, Irisette 

Sisyrinchium angustifolium 

This grass-like perennial which has somewhat the appearance 
of a tiny iris is found in large masses with its profusion of dainty, 
small blue flowers. Widely distributed in the State where it is 
found in woods, fields, and roadsides; more often in sunny locations. 
It may be transplanted with care. 

Stem (flower stalk) mostly erect, simple, winged, stiff, 4 to 20 
inches tall, generally extending above the leaves. Leaves all arising 
from base of stem, usually erect, long, grass-like, slightly broader 
than the stem. Flowers few, in clusters on end of stem, each con- 
sisting of six blue, short-tipped, petal-like segments with a yellow 
eye. April-May. 

PINKROOT SPIGELIA, Indian Pink, Carolina Pink, Pinkroot 

Spigelia marylandica 

It seems incredible that this flower has so seldom found its way 
into the cultivated gardens of the State. Its striking flowers and 
attractive dark green foliage would score higher than most com- 
monly cultivated perennials, should each be given a grade. Al- 
though it is found throughout most of the State it is more abundant 
in Central and North Mississippi. Found singly or in groups in 
creek bottoms, rich woods, and hillsides. Even though it grows well 
in full sun, it is more often found in shady situations. Easily trans- 
planted. Volunteer seedlings appear readily in the spring when 
plants are grown under cultivation. Highly recommended for the 
cultivated or wild garden. 

Stem erect, unbranched, 1 to 2 feet tall. Leaves opposite, IV2 
to 4 inches long, not divided, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, often tap- 
ering to a sharp point. Flowers on single or clustered spikes, tube- 
shaped, narrow at bottom, gradually widening to a five-pointed top, 
scarlet outside, yellow inside. April-May. 

STOKESIA, Stokes' Aster 

Stokesia laevis 

A native flower that has been widely cultivated in many sec- 
tions of the United States. Found in sunny or shady places in moist 
pinelands along the Coastal Plain of South Mississippi. Reseeds 
readily in cultivated areas. Seeds, which may be obtained from 
seedsmen, often are planted in the garden. Plants may be trans- 
planted from the woods. 

Stem erect, stout, wooly, 8 inches to 2 feet tall. Leaves alter-

nate, few, the lower ones more or less lance-shaped, narrowed into 
a petiole with an enlarged attachment point; the upper ones lance- 
shaped to egg-shaped, clasping the stem at attachment point. Flow- 
er heads produced singly on ends of main stem and branches, large, 
showy, purplish-blue, with numerous five-pointed, strip-shaped seg- 
ments surrounding a cluster of shorter tubes, each divided into five 
narrow lobes at the top. June-September. 

VIRGINIA TEPHROSIA, Devil's Shoestrings, 

Rabbitpea, Catgut 

Tephrosia virginiana 

The bright colored flowers of this perennial are conspicuous in 
the woods during the blooming season. Usually grows in open 
woods in dry, sandy soil in South Mississippi. Difficult to trans- 
plant. 

Stem erect, soft-hairy, 1 to 2 feet tall. Leaves alternate, com- 
pound; leaflets 11 to 25, up to 1 inch long, short-hairy on under side, 
short-bristle-tipped. Flowers in hairy clusters on end of stem and 
on stalks arising from axils of upper leaves; each flower shaped like 
a pea blossom, the large, erect, hairy petal (standard) paie yellow, 
the other parts (wings and keel) pink and purplish. April-May. 

HAIRY SPIDERWORT, Blue jacket 

Tradescantia hirsuticaulis 

A perennial with attractive Dlue flowers that is a satisfactory 
subject fo^ cultivation It has a relatively long blooming season that 
begins in mJd-spring. Usually found in sunny or partially shaded 
situations in fields, sandy woods, and dry banks. Rather widely 
distributed throughout the State. Easily transplanted. 

Stem simple, or brar ched toward base, covered with long, white, 
coarse, stiff hairs. Leaves alternate, encircling the stem at attach- 
ment point, narrowed from base to a long point, covered with hairs. 
Flowers in clusters, few to several in number, on ends of stems or 
in axils of leaves, each consisting of three egg-shaped, blue petals. 
April-May. 

SPIDEBWORT 

Tradescantia reflexa 

A perennial which occurs frenuentlv in most parts of the State. 
Woods, sandhills, barrens, bottoms, and pinelands are situations 
where it is found. Suitable for sunn;^ or shady places. Relatively 
long blooming period. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, smooth, slender, jointed, siinpie or branched, up to 
3 feet tall, sometimes covered with a whitish bloom Leaves alter- 
nate, encircling the stem at the attachment point, smooth with oc- 
casional hairs near the attachment point. Flowers in flat-topped

clusters on end of stem or in axils of leaves, each consisting of three 
broadly egg-shaped, blue petals. March-May. 

PRAIRIE TRILLIUM, Wakerobin, Birthroot, Red Trillium 

Trillium recurvatum 

A perennial that is more particularly attractive for its foliage 
than for its flowers. One of the earliest wild flowers to bloom in 
spring. Found in various parts of the State, usually in rich woods 
and banks of streams. A fine selection for shady places in the wild 
garden. The short, thick rootstocks may be transplanted during 
early spring, fall or winter. 

Stem erect, smooth, 4 to 15 inches tall. Leaves three in num- 
ber in a whorl at top of stalk, egg-shaped, lance-shaped, or oval, 
mottled in color, with petiole-like bases. Flowers produced singly 
on end of stem in middle of leaf whorl, the three purple^ egg-shaped 
petals curved upward, Spring,

COMMON CATTAIL, Broadleaved Cattail 
Typha latifolia 

One of the common perennials throughout the State that is at- 
tractive for its fruits which form a brown club-like mass. Found in 
marshes, pools, ditches, and stream shores. Though it is used occas- 
ionally in garden pools, it is likely to crowd out other aquatic plants 
grown with it. Easily transplanted. 

Stem erect, smooth, round, 4 to 8 feet tall. Leaves numerous, 
long, flat, sword-shaped, sheathing the stem at its base. Flowers 
densely crowded into long, brown spikes on ends of stems, the light- 
er colored flowers on top part of spike usually shedding to leave a 
naked stem projecting above the darker brown part. June- July. 



MOTH MULLEIN 



1 



Verbascum blattaria 

A perennial that should be more widely used in the cultivated 
garden. Suitable for sunny situations. Found in old fields and 
roadsides in most sections of the State. Transplant during dor- 
mant season. 

Stem erect, 1 to 4 feet tall, smooth to- 
ward bottom, covered with glandular hairs 
toward top, simple or slightly branched. 
Leaves of lower stem oblong, petioled, 
doubly-toothed, those of middle and upper 
stem lance-shaped to egg-shaped, clasping 
stem at attachment point; leaves becoming 
smaller from base to top of plant. Flowers 
produced along upper portion of main stem 
and branches (if any) on short, alternately- 
arranged stalks arising from axils of small, 
leaf-like bracts; each flower consisting of 
a yellow or white, flat, wheel-shaped 
corolla, 1 to 2 inches wide, with five round- 
ed, unequal lobes; the center of the corolla 
conspicuous with a cluster of purple hairs 
from which protrude smaller flower parts 
(stamens, stigma, style) giving a moth-like 
appearance. May-June.

DAKOTA VERBENA 

Verbena bipinnatifida 

Although this perennial has been introduced, it appears to be 
native in many parts of the State. It is often found in large masses 
along highways, indicating that this would make a desirable plant 
to use in roadside plantings. Usually found in sunny locations and 
thrives in poor soil. Often used in the cultivated garden. Blooms 
profusely in early spring and continues to bloom throughout the 
summer. Easily transplanted. 

Stem mostly erect, 4 to 15 inches tall, covered with bristly hairs. 
Leaves opposite, rather finely divided. Flowers in dense clusters 
on end of stem, each consisting of five-notched, bluish-purple or 
lilac petals that fuse to form a slender tube. Spring-Summer. 

MOSS VERBENA 

Verbena laciniata 

This plant apparently has been introduced; however, it has be- 
come well established in old fields and roadsides in many parts of 
the State. It is particularly abundant in southern part of State. 
A perennial that prefers full sun. Grows well on poor soil. Easily 
transplanted. 

Stem and branches spreading, lying flat on ground except for 
mostly erect flower-bearing tips, often rooting at joints, partially 
covered with short, stiff hairs. Leaves opposite, twice-divided into 
rather narrow, sometimes awl-shaped, spreading segments; the seg- 
ments rough with short, stiff hairs, specially along veins on under- 
surface. Flowers thickly arranged on tips of stem and branches, 
each flower consisting of a small, slightly crooked tube, divided at 
the top into five spreading, notched petals; flowers rose-purple, 
pink, or sometimes white. April-June. 

BIRDSFOOT VIOLET, Crowfoot Violet, Johnny-jump-up 

Viola pedata 

One of the most attractive of the small wild flowers. Of the 
many native violets, this one is most sought as flowers to gather in 
the woods or as plants to be set in the garden. Found in many parts 
of the State, more often in acid soil. Grows in sunny or partially 
shady places in open woods and dry fields. Easily transplanted. 

Stem lacking, the leaves and flower stalks arising directly from 
the erect rootstock. Leaves nearly smooth, coarsely divided into 
three parts each of which is further divided into three to five seg- 
ments that are often two- to four-toothed near the tip. Flowers pro- 
duced singly on leafless stalks slightly taller than leaves, the upper 
two petals dark violet, the lower three lilac-purple, or sometimes 
all five lilac-purple, with a conspicuous orange spot in the center. 
April-May.

NETVEIN CHAINFERN 

Woodwardia areolata 

Although most ferns are easy to grow, plants are seldom used 
in the home landscape. This fern is usually found in shady places 
in moist or wet soil. Widely distributed. Easily transplanted. 

Leaves of two kii;ids; sterile leaves 8 to 24 inches tall, with al- 
ternate, lance-shaped, finely-toothed divisions connected by a broad 
wing extending along the leaf stem (rachis); fertile leaves taller, 
with narrower divisions almost or entirely without a connecting 
wing. 

ATAMASCOLILY, Zephyrlily, Fairylily, Rainlily 
Zephyranthes atamosco 

A bulbous perennial of rare beauty that has been used to some 
extent in gardens of this State; however, it has not received the 
attention it deserves. Usually found in colonies in rich woods and 
low swamp areas. Although it will grow in full sun, shady places 
are preferable. Common in central and southern part of State. 
Bulbs may be transplanted any time; however, July and August 
when the foliage of the plant begins to turn brown is preferable. 

Stem lacking except for a leafless flower stalk. Leaves all basal, 
arising directly from an underground bulb, 8 to 16 inches long, nar- 
row, dark green, grooved, with sharp edges and a rather sharp point. 
Flowers produced singly on leafless stalks 8 to 14 inches tall, tube- 
shaped at base, becoming funnel-shaped toward top, with six spread- 
ing, petal-like, white or pinkish segments 2V2 to 4 inches long. 
April-May.

Traditional 
Food Preparation Rules 

By DOROTHY DICKINS 
Department of Home Economics 

In connection with the first phase of a food preparation 
study conducted in four small towns of Mississippi, home- 
makers in the 1,158 families included, were asked by white 
and Negro home economics teachers who were employed 
as interview^ers, a question concerning rules taught by 
mother or someone else at home when learning to cook — 
rules such as "One can't cook string beans too much."^ The 
purpose of this question was to furnish background in- 
formation to use in working out record forms. Since the 
rules thus collected help us to understand some of the food 
preparation practices now prevalent, it seemed worthwhile 
to make a separate analysis of them. 

Homemakers Reporting Food Preparation Rules 

As may be noted from table 1, a little more than one- 
half of the white homemakers and eight-tenths of the 
Negro homemakers gave the interviewers one or more food 
preparation rules taught them. In the group not reporting 
rules taught were those who said they had learned from a 
cookbook or in a cooking class and several white home- 
makers who had never cooked. Families taking their meals 
away from home were not included in the study. 

That Negro homemakers much more often gave food 
preparation rules than did white homemakers, may have 
been because the Negro homemaker had less often learned 
to cook in the cooking class or from a cookbook than had the 
white homemaker. Thirty-two percent of the white home- 
makers and 12 percent of the Negro homemakers had had 
training in a cooking class in public school or college. White 



iThe reason for using this rule as an illustration was that in a previous stiady 
it had been griven by a number of homemakers.

homemakers could use to better advantage printed material 
pertaining to food preparation, for median grade completed 
by them was the twelfth. Median grade completed by Negro 
homemakers was the sixth. 

It is not possible to state how many grades a home- 
maker must have completed to understand the food prepara- 
tion reading material available. Much would depend on 
the extent to which she had continued her education since 
leaving school. It seems extremely unlikely that home- 
makers with sixth grade or less schooling could under- 
stand most of the available material on food preparation. 
Even if they do understand some of it, there is a question 
about their having the ingredients called for in recipe books, 
since little schooling and low income are associated.- Recipe 
books usually assume more ingredients on pantry shelves 
than low income families have. Under these circumstances, 
it is not surprising that Negro women could report more 
food preparation rules learned from mother.

More older women than younger women (white as well 
as Negro) gave one or more rules taught in learning to 
cook (table 1). Younger women are more likely to be 
recipe cooks, since cooking by recipe is of fairly recent de- 
velopment. About 60 percent of the white homemakers 
over 40 years and 43 percent 40 years and under, gave one 
or more food preparation rules. Eighty-seven percent of 
the Negro homemakers over 40 years and 82 percent 40 
years and under, gave one or more food preparation rules. 
In other words, there was not as great difference in the

Negro group was $7.50 or less.

proportion of older and younger women giving rules in 
case of Negroes as in case of whites. The younger white 
women had, no doubt, had more opportunity to learn food 
preparation in the cooking class and from books than had 
the younger Negro women. 

Foods Which Rules Reported Concerned 

About 64 percent of the rules given by white women and 
68 percent by Negro women concerned preparation of 
vegetables. The fact that so many vegetable rules were 
reported, it is thought, is not because of the use of an 
illustration from the vegetable group in the initial question 
since each homemaker was questioned about preparation 
rules of all food types. Without doubt the main factor is 
that a greater variety in vegetables than foods of other 
types were ordinarily prepared in parental families of home- 
makers of this study. 

Meat, poultry, and fish preparation rules were next in 
importance to vegetable preparation rules for all groups 
(table 2), though Negro women reported relatively more 
than white women. Only 22 percent of the rules reported 
by white women and 5 percent reported by Negro women 
concerned preparation of other foods. That more of the 
rules given by white women pertained to preparation of 
cake and various kinds of bread was no doubt because more 
of the families of white women prepared these foods. Eighty- 
six percent of the Negro homemakers were farm-reared, 
the large majority in homes of nonowner families of low 
socioeconomic status. 

Frequency in Which Rules Referring to Preparation 
of Particular Foods Occurred 

One interesting question is the extent to which the 
rules given by these homemakers apply to particular foods 
such as turnip greens, beefsteak, and to types of foods 
such as vegetables and meats. According to Dr. Margaret 
Mead, in primitive societies each child is taught a separate 
piece of skill, such as how to roast the leg of a deer, rather

than general principles that apply to types of food, i. e., all 
meats.^ 

About three-fourths of the vegetable rules reported by 
Negro women and two-thirds reported by white women, 
pertained to specific vegetables. In the case of meat, only 
about one-third of the rules reported by both groups con- 
cerned preparation of specific meats or cuts of meat. The 
fact that meat and pork are synonymous terms to many 
rural people in Mississippi might be interpreted to mean 
that some of the rules applying to preparation of meat really 
applied to preparation of pork. However, bread and corn- 
bread are likewise synonymous terms to many rural people 
in the State, the rules given by homemakers in all cases 
concerned preparation of specific breads; i. e., cornbread, 
biscuits, rolls. The facts that homemakers of this study

resided in towns where a variety of meat or cuts of meat 
could be secured, and that a variety appeared on records of 
menus served which were submitted by these women in 
connection with another part of this study, would suggest 
that homemakers in reporting rules referred to meat in 
general, rather than pork, when they mentioned meat. All 
this can be interpreted to mean that not only are more 
vegetable rules passed down from mothers to daughters, 
but also that rules passed down are more likely to be 
specific, i. e., apply to particular vegetables. 

The frequency of negative rules was studied as one 
possible explanation for relatively more rules applying to 
preparation of all vegetables being reported by 
Negro women than by white women. It was thought that 
negative points might be aimed at a tendency to overgen- 
eralize or at an absence of a body of practice such as must 
have been true of field Negroes when they first entered 
the house as house servants, or aimed by white employers 
at practices which Negroes followed in their own homes 
and carried over into the kitchens of white employers. 

Fourteen vegetable preparation rules reported by 
Negroes and 42 by whites were negative rules ; i. e., ''Do not 
peel potatoes as you lose vitamins," "Never cook cabbage 
long,'' ''Don't add soda to vegetables." This means that 
the tendency of the Negro to generalize vegetable rules 
cannot be accounted for by negative rules which were more 
common in the white group. 

Eleven percent of all the preparation rules reported by 
white women and 3 percent of all the rules reported by 
Negro women were negative rules. Three-fourths of the 
negative rules reported by white women and two-thirds by 
Negro women represent the more modern attitudes and 
beliefs. This is a much higher proportion than in case of 
positive rules representing such attitudes and beliefs. These 
vegetable rules are probably associated with conscious cul- 
tural change such as is involved in modern home economics 
education. 

That more vegetable preparation rules reported by 
white homemakers pertained to preparation of specific 



10 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

vegetables may be due to the fact that the variety of vege- 
tables used by white families was greater. The following 
vegetables were mentioned in rules given by white women 
but not by Negro women: spinach, eggplant, carrots, mus- 
tard, English peas, butter beans, canned string beans. Irish 
potatoes, sweetpotatoes, turnip greens, turnips, cabbage, 
string beans, and collards were, however, the vegetables 
most often mentioned in rules given by both groups. 

There was apparently a trend away from rules men- 
tioning particular foods to rules of more general application. 
In 66 percent of the rules reported by white women over 
40 years of age, and 61 percent by Negro women over 40 
years of age, a particular food was named. Fifty-six per- 
cent of the rules reported by younger white women and 52 
percent by younger Negro women referred to a particular 
food. 

The Problem of Classifying Preparation Rules 

One possible way of classifying preparation rules tried 
out was by source, i. e., (1) scientific rules, (2) out-of-date 
written tradition, (3) oral tradition (table 3). Thus, as will 
be noted, it was not possible with the information available 
to classify by source the majority of rules reported. 

''Scientific rules" were preparation rules in agreement 
with recommendations of modern nutrition and/or food 
specialists. ''Out-of-date written tradition'* included prepa- 
ration rules found in four of the popular older cookbooks, 
now outdated because of increased knowledge of nutrition 
or better technical methods developed by food specialists 
or changes in processing.^ It is likely that more rules would 
have been classified in this category had more old cook- 
books been examined. 

One characteristic of rules whose source is oral tradi- 
tion is reasons attached to rules so as to make them stick

in the memory. However, in this study, as great a tendency 
was found to attach reasons to the rules found in the old 
cookbooks as in those whose source was not ascertained. 
But there was a difference in the kind of reasons attached. 
In the group of rules whose source was not known, a num- 
ber of reasons for rules inferring that unwholesome quali- 
ties exist in the food at all times or at certain periods 
(at time of first harvest, when there has been a lot of rain, 
when there has been sickness) were given. Such reasons 
did not accompany rules found in old cookbooks. There- 
fore, rules listed as oral tradition are limited here to rules 
whose source was not determined and which were accom- 
panied with reasons implying unwholesome qualities in 
food. 

The rules thus classified as oral tradition may repre- 
sent a Negro folk contribution. The fact that Negroes re- 
ported about six times more of them than did whites would 
support this hypothesis (table 3). All except six of the 
rules in this category were reported in connection with 
vegetable preparation. Among these reasons were: **to

keep from making sick," **to remove the poison substance," 
"to draw out the poison," ''to draw out the sap," ''to make 
fit to eat," "to make healthy," "to soak out the fever," "to 
draw out the heat," "to kill germs." The three most common 
were: "to keep from making sick," "to remove poison," and 
"to draw out sap." The sap apparently affected the vege- 
table adversely by introducing a poison into the system 
that, even if it did not cause sickness, was not healthful. 

Eighty-three percent of the 718 rules given by Negro 
homemakers and 26 percent of the 781 by white homemak- 
ers contained a reason for the rule. Sixty-six percent of 
the "scientific" rules reported by Negroes and 18 percent 
by whites had reasons attached. In other words, even in 
the case of recommendations of food and nutrition specialists 
there was an attempt to commend the practice on the basis 
of a sound practical sense. This may mean that in passing 
on scientific material and especially to the Negro, "the 
home economics teacher says so" is not a sufficient reason. 
A practical reason should be given with every rule. 

According to the classification of food preparation 
rules by source (table 3), rules taught white women were 
either those accepted by modern food and nutrition special- 
ists or out-of-date written tradition. Negro women seem- 
ed to have been taught rules in about equal number in 
all three classes. However, 64 of the 98 rules classified 
as written tradition reported by Negro women referred to 
soaking meat in vinegar to tender, a rule found in only 
one cookbook examined.'' The rules reported by white home- 
makers classified as "written tradition" were quite varied. 

From these data it would seem that there was a ten- 
dency for younger white and Negro women to report more 
often recommendations of modern nutrition and food 
specialists, for older white women to report more fre- 
quently out-of-date written tradition, and for older Negro 
women to report oral tradition accompanied with reasons 
inferring that unwholesome qualities exist in food. 

An examination of the rules reported by the 1,158 



•'•Zieman and Gillette, op. cit., p. 54L 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES

homemakers of this study shows the difficulty of dis- 
tinguishing between written and oral tradition, since in 
passing on such rules changes are made in wording and 
often in meaning. 

In connection with changes in wording, it might here 
be mentioned that white homemakers reported what seem- 
ed to be 357 different preparation rules; Negro homemak- 
ers 326. But when a classified list was compiled of all 
rules reported, and each rule counted as a distinct rule 
if it did not contain the exact wording of another rule, the 
number reported by white women was 579 and by Negro 
women 533.^ 

Classification of Food Preparation Rules 

For the purpose of this study, the rules reported were 
classified into five groups: (1) preparation rules which are 
in accord with practices now recommended by nutrition and 
food specialists, (2) preparation rules which are in accord 
with directions found in old cookbooks examined, but are 
now out-of-date because of increased knowledge of nutrition 
or better technical methods or changes in processing, (3) 
preparation rules which are in accord with observation 
but not found in old cookbooks examined which are now 
out-of-date because of increased knowledge of nutrition or 
better technical methods or changes in processing, (4) 
preparation rules seeming to have little or no basis, (5) 
preparation rules of the recipe type. 

As may be noted from table 4, the majority of rules 
given by all four groups fell in the "seeming to have but 
little or no basis" classification. They are not in accord 
with practices now recommended, nor are they of the recipe 
type or in accord with observation. They were not found 
in the old cookbooks examined. Examples of rules classified 
in this category are ''parboil new Irish potatoes," ''drop a 
nail in the pot of tough meats to make cook quickly," "wash 
cabbage in soda water to kill poison," "tip around while 
baking cake to keep cake from falling."

sissippi Experiment Station. 



l4 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

Rules in accordance with practices now recommended 
by specialists were next in importance with white home- 
makers (table 4). These rules were of two types : (1) those 
in accord with recommendations of nutrition specialists 
(nutrition recommendations), (2) those in accord with 
recommendations of food specialists (technical recommenda- 
tions). Examples of the former type are "do not drain 
liquid from vegetables," *'cook meat at low temperature 
and in a small amount of water," "always boil meat first 
before adding vegetables." Examples of the latter type are 
"always warm milk before adding to potatoes for mashing 
— makes them fluffier," "always cook cornbread and biscuit 
quickly," "a straw will come out clean when cake is done." 
When rules were both nutritional and technical, as was 
the one concerning cooking of meat, the rule was classified 
by the first or main reason. 

Rules in accord with observation but not found in 
cookbooks examined, now outdated, were of second im- 
portance to Negroes (table 4). These rules were also of 
two types: (1) those outdated because of increased knowl- 
edge of nutrition, (2) those outdated because of better 
technical methods developed by food specialists or changes 
in processing. Examples of rules in accord with observa- 
tions now outdated because of increased knowledge of nutri- 
tion are "always parboil turnip greens to make less strong," 
"put soda in collards to tender." Examples of outdating 
because of changes in processing or development of better 
technical methods are "to keep fresh pork, fry and pack 
in fat in sterilized jars. Store in a cool place. This is 
good for a month," "boil meat until tender, then bake." 

The principal difference in rules classified in groups II 
and III was that rules classified in group II appeared in 
the cookbooks examined. Rules in group III were not found 
in cookbooks examined, but were based on sound observa- 
tion. Rules in both groups were outdated. Examples of rules 
classified in group II outdated because of increased knowl- 
edge of nutrition include "pour first water off of cabbage 
and add more," "always put old potatoes on in cold water." 
Examples of rules in group II outdated because of develop-

ment of better technical methods or changes in processing 
include ''always beat cake batter thoroughly," ''parboil 
salt meat to remove salt before frying."

Rules of the recipe type were of less importance than 
those classified in the other four categories (table 4). Ex- 
amples of such rules include "always use eggs in making 
cornbread," "use the 1-2-3-4 rule in making cakes," "put a 
little sugar in all vegetables. Tastes better." 

In several instances, as will be noted in later discus- 
sions, rules concerning use of specific ingredients or objects 
in preparation have been classified in more than one group. 
Thus, use-of-soda-to-tender-vegetables rules were classified 
in group III, but rules such as "wash cabbage in soda water 
to kill poison," "add a little soda to vegetables to make taste 
better" were classified in group IV. Rules concerning use 
of nails in cooking meat and poultry were classified either 
in group I or group IV. For example, the rule "put a nail 
in roast to cook quicker" was placed in group I, but "put 
a nail in the pot with roast to cook quicker," "put nails in 
roasts to tender," "put nails in pot of cooking roast to 
tender," were placed in group IV. 

VEGETABLE PREPARATION RULES 

All groups more often reported vegetable preparation 
rules seeming to have but little or no basis, but relatively 
more of those given by white women were in this group 
than by Negro women. White women also gave relatively 
more vegetable preparation rules in accord with practices 
now recommended and more rules in accord with directions 
found in old cookbooks examined, but now outdated (table 
5). The type of oral tradition which is originally ground- 
ed in cookbooks may prove very stubborn and difficult to 
penetrate with increased knowledge of nutrition or better 
technical methods worked out by scientists as the earlier 
tradition had itself certain sanction. 

Negro women reported relatively three times more 
vegetable preparation rules in accord with observation but 
not found in old cookbooks examined and now out-of-date 
than did white women. This supports a previous statement 
that "practical" rules seem to appeal especially to Negro 
women. To break down such practices as adding a pinch

of soda may, therefore, mean finding a less objectionable 
way to tenderize or cook quickly. 

The principal difference in vegetable preparation rules 
given by older and younger women was in the proportion

of rules reported in agreement with recommendations of 
modern nutrition specialists. About 11 percent of the 
vegetable rules reported by older white women were classi- 
fied in this group, while 19 percent, or nearly one-fifth 
reported by younger white women were placed in this group 
(table 5). This would be expected, since there had been 
less change in recommendations in the shorter period dur- 
ing which the younger group had kept house. 

Vegetable Preparation Rules in Accord With Practices 
Now Recommended 

Vegetable preparation rules in accord with practices 
now recommended, given most often by both white and 
Negro women, included rules concerning: (1) cooking time, 
20 by whites and 8 by Negroes; (2) amount of water in 
which vegetables started, 7 by whites and 10 by Negroes; 
(3) temperature of water in which vegetable started, 14 
by whites and 5 by Negroes ; and (4) techniques for prepara- 
tion of particular vegetables, 7 by whites and 10 by Negroes. 
Rules in the first three groups were practices now recom- 
mended by nutrition specialists, while those in the fourth 
group were practices recommended by food specialists 
(technical recommendations). 

Twelve of the 20 time-of-cooking rules given by white 
women and 2 of the 8 given by Negro women referred to 
cooking cabbage a short time: "Cook cabbage a short time," 
''don't overcook cabbage." Only two other vegetables were 
mentioned in time of cooking rules — string beans by a 
Negro woman and Irish potatoes by a white woman. Four 
of those given by white and four by Negro women referred 
to time for cooking all vegetables; i. e., ''Cook vegetables 
until tender," "vegetables cooked quickly taste better," 
"never overcook vegetables." Three rules given by white wo- 
men and one by a Negro woman concerned boiling salt pork 
before adding the vegetable. These four rules were classi- 
fied as time-of-cooking rules, since one reason for long 
cooking is starting the vegetable with raw salt pork and 
cooking until the meat is very tender. One means of re- 
ducing cooking time is to have the pork nearly cooked at 
the time of adding the vegetable. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES

Among the amount-of -water rules classified in group I, 
given by white women, were : "Never put water in spinach," 
"cook string beans in very little water," "don't use much 
water in fixing vegetables." Among those given by Negro 
women were: "The less water one uses in vegetables the 
better taste they have," "cook squash in a small amount of 
water and grease," "cook string beans in just enough water 
to get tender." 

Seven of the temperature-of-water rules reported by 
white women and two by Negro women mentioned par- 
ticular vegetables, such as potatoes, turnip greens, cabbage : 
"Put turnip geens on in boiling water," "put beans and 
cabbage on in hot water," "start turnip greens in hot water." 

Included in the group of techniques in preparing par- 
ticular vegetables reported by the women of this study 
which are in accord with recommendations of food special- 
ists were : "Cut corn at tip and scrape to keep from getting 
in hulls," "always leave some stems on beets until they 
are cooked," "dry potatoes before frying." 

Among other important rules classified in group I and 
reported by white homemakers were 11 rules concerning 
cooking with peeling on or preparing vegetables so that 
there was as little waste as possible from peeling. No rule 
of this type was reported by Negro homemakers. Among 
the peeling rules were: "Always cook old potatoes with 
skins on," "peel potatoes as thin as possible to save food 
value," "always cook potatoes with jackets on," "do not 
peel potatoes, as lose vitamins," "boil sweetpotatoes with 
skins on," "always leave skins on vegetables when possi- 
ble," "never peel carrots but scrape them." 

Other vegetable preparation rules classified in group 
I were quite varied and included rules concerning nonuse of 
soda, tests of doneness, not draining liquid, time of harvest, 
care between harvesting and cooking, preparation for cook- 
ing, removing scorched taste, reducing ill effects of odor, 
and cooking with lid.

Vegetable Preparation Rules in Accord With Directions 
Found in Old Cookbooks Examined, Now Outdated 

Since older cookbooks are written tradition (research 
in the nutritional and technical aspects of food preparation 
are of fairly recent development), most of this section will 
be devoted to calling attention to some of the similarities 
found in vegetable preparation rules reported by home- 
makers and found in cookbooks examined. 

The most common type of outmoded vegetable prepara- 
tion rule reported by homemakers which appeared in cook- 
books examined was one concerning soaking fresh vege- 
tables in water before cooking. Twentj' of the 57 vegetable 
preparation rules reported by white women and classified 
in group II, and 8 of the 16 reported by Negro women and 
also classified in this group were soaking rules. Soaking 
vegetables is not now recommended, since water-soluble 
vitamins go into the soaking water which is discarded when 
the vegetable is put on to cook'. 

Among statements concerning soaking of vegetables 
found in cookbooks examined were: ''Lay when peeled in 
cold water for some time before cooking"^ (one of eight rules 
given by Harland applicable to preparation and cooking all 
vegetables), "most vegetables when peeled are better flavor- 
ed when laid in cold water a short time before cooking,"^ 
''remove the outside leaves of cabbage, cut into quarters, 
cut off the tough center, and soak in cold salted water 
one-half hour."^*^ These statements closely paralleled sev- 
eral given by women of this study, two of which were "al- 
ways prepare vegetables and put in water until ready to 
cook," and "always quarter cabbage and let set in water an 
hour before cooking." 

The outdated vegetable preparation rule of next im- 
portance reported by homemakers of this study, found in 
cookbooks examined, was a rule concerning parboiling two 

^According to recent investigations in nutrition, the loss of vitamins during 
soaking is small. Even though the loss is small, the practice is useless unless 
perhaps in case of wilted vegetables. How much cooking time is reduced and flavor 
improved by soaking wilted vegetables is not known. However, it is known that 
soaking wilted vegetables does not restore the vitamin C lost in wilting.

of the strong flavored vegetables — cabbage and onions. 
Parboiling cabbage and onions is not now recommended 
by nutrition specialists, since valuable minerals and vita- 
mins are lost by such procedure. Eight parboiling rules 
of this type were given by Negro women, four by white 
women. Among them were: 'Tour first water from cab- 
bage and add more," ''always parboil cabbage," "parboil 
onions to improve flavor." 

Similar statements concerning parboiling cabbage and 
onions found in old cookbooks were: ''Always boil cabbage 
in two waters,"^^ "cut off tops and tails of onions and skin 
them. Lay in cold water half an hour, then put into a sauce 
pan with enough boiling water to cover them. Cook fifteen 
minutes and drain off the water. Re-cover them with 
more from the boiling teakettle. Boil until a straw will 
pierce them, drain and put into a dish with pepper, salt, and 
plenty of butter."^- 

Other rules which are now outdated because of in- 
creased knowledge of nutrition reported by a number of 
white homemakers and corresponding to those found in 
old cookbooks examined, pertained to time of cooking and 
amount of water. Among these were: "Cook vegetables 
until thoroughly done," "boil string beans for two hours," 
"boil string beans for three hours," "start string beans with 
water just enough to cover," "start cabbage in a great deal 
of water." These same rules were found in one or more of 
the old cookbooks examined, though 2 and 3 hours were 
given in these books as maximum cooking time for cooking 
string beans rather than the cooking time.^^ 

It would seem that old cookbooks may be in part re- 
sponsible for preserving the outmoded practice of long cook- 
ing, especially of string beans. In food preparation studies 
now being made by the writer in which records of cook- 
ing time for various vegetables have been secured, string 
beans is among the vegetables cooked for the longest time. 

Time-of-adding-salt rules, stating that salt should be 
added at the end of cooking process, were reported by 



llHarland, op. cit.. p. 219. 
I21bid, p. 228. 

l-Parloa, op cit., p. 237, and Lincoln, op. cit., p. 298. 



22 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

eight white homemakers. Since food specialists recommend 
that salt be added at the beginning of the cooking process, 
as adding at first helps retain color of green vegetables and 
improves flavor, these rules were classified as rules out- 
dated because of better technical developments (table 5). 
(Nutritionists have not shown that adding salt at first in- 
creases cooking losses.) Among statements appearing in 
cookbooks examined pertaining to addition of salt at end 
of cooking process, were : "The salt should never be put in 
peas before they are tender unless very young, as it tends 
to harden them,"^* "after string beans have boiled until 
tender and the water nearly boiled out, add pepper and 
salt."^'^ These statements corresponded to: "Never salt 
peas (dry or fresh) until tender'* and "never salt string 
beans until they're done" reported by white homemakers 
of this study. 

Other vegetable preparation rules in accord with direc- 
tions found in old cookbooks examined, given by white and 
Negro women, that are now outdated include rules per- 
taining to draining vegetables, concerning temperature of 
water in which to start Irish potatoes, and danger of allow- 
ing food to stand in tin cans. 

Vegetable Preparation Rules in Accord With Observation 
but Not Found in Old Cookbooks Examined, Now Outdated 

All of the 169 rules classified in this category except 
6 — 3 given by white women, and 3 by Negro women — were 
rules for parboiling to reduce bitter or strong taste or musty 
flavor or to keep from turning dark, and for the use of 
soda to cook quicker, to tender, and/or to retain color. All 
vegetable preparation rules classified in group III were in 
accord with observation but outdated because of increased 
knowledge of nutrition. None of these rules were found 
in the old cookbooks examined. 

White homemakers reported 27 parboiling rules of the 
type described above. Negro homemakers reported 10. 
Among these given by the white group were seven con- 
cerning parboiling dried peas and beans, seven concerning 



14Zieman & Gillette, op. cit.. p. 20L 
isibid, p. 199. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 23 

parboiling of spinach, seven concerning parboiling of turnip 
greens, two concerning parboiling mustard greens, and 
one concerning parboiling of collards, to make less strong or 
to remove musty taste or to remove bitter taste. Three 
rules were given for parboiling sweetpotatoes to keep them 
from turning dark. 

Negroes mentioned parboiling of turnip greens in five 
rules, dried peas in three, and collards in one. Parboiling 
sweetpotatoes to keep them from turning dark was men- 
tioned by only one Negro woman. 

Fourteen use-of-soda rules reported by white women 
and 112 reported by Negro women were classified in group 
III. These included addition of soda to vegetables during 
cooking, or washing in soda water in order to cook quicker, 
to tender, or to "keep green color." While these rules are 
based on sound observation, they fail to obtain an objective 
which modern nutrition regards as more important; i. e., 
preservation of vitamins. 

In only three instances was the addition of soda to 
vegetables in cooking mentioned in the cookbooks examin- 
ed. It was mentioned once by Lincoln in connection with 
use of soda for keeping color of vegetables. 'This," she de- 
clared, **was a practice by many, but unwisely so."^^ The 
other two occasions were in connection with preparation 
of Boston baked beans — a vegetable dish not mentioned in 
any rule submitted, a dish not ordinarily prepared by the 
Mississippi housewife.^' It is possible, however, that the 
rules on the use of soda in tendering vegetables came from 
its use in preparation of Boston beans and that rules for 
parboiling turnip greens, spinach, dry peas, mustard greens, 
collards to make taste better, came from rules pertaining 
to parboiling cabbage and onions. There are no means of 
checking on this connection. Then, too, as has been sug- 
gested before, perhaps some of these rules would have been 
found had more cookbooks been examined. 

Of the 112 use-of-soda rules reported by Negro women 

l^Lincoln, op. cit. p. 291. Recent investigations have demonstrated that a 
small amount of soda can be used in cooking vegetables without loss of vitamin Bl 
provided cooking time is short. However, on the basis of cooking records secured 
in connection with another phase of this investigation, it seems unlikely that those 
using soda will control either cooking time or amount of soda to the extent 
necessary to prevent loss. 

I'Ibid, p. 250, and Zieman & Gillette, op. cit., p. 142. 



24 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

classified in group III, 87 concerned addition of "a little 
soda" or "a pinch of soda" or ''soda" to vegetables or to 
a specific vegetable to tender or cook quicker. Twenty- 
three were rules for washing in soda water to tender. 
Washing in soda water might be less objectionable than 
adding soda during cooking, if less soda was left on the 
vegetable after washing than added during cooking. The 
other two were "add a little pinch of soda to vegetable 
to keep color," and "add soda to turnip greens to tender 
and keep color." In 66 of the 112 soda rules the word 
"vegetable" was used; in 3, the words "tough vegetables;" 
in 4, the words "green or green leafy ;" and in 39, particular 
vegetables, i. e., turnip greens, cabbage, collards, and string 
beans. 

Thirteen of the 14 use-of-soda rules reported by white 
women classified in group III pertained to addition of soda 
to vegetables in order to tender or cook quicker. One rule 
concerned addition of soda to "keep vegetable green." No 
rule was given for washing in soda water to tender. Five 
rules mentioned particular vegetables such as turnip greens, 
cabbage, and dry peas and beans. 

Vegetable Preparation Rules Seeming to Have But Little 

or No Basis 

The most frequent type of rule reported by both white 
and Negro women classified in this group (group IV) 
was a rule referring to preparation of new vegetables. (By 
a new vegetable is meant the first "mess" or "messes" of 
vegetables harvested.) One hundred and twenty-nine such 
rules were given by white women, 72 by Negro women. 
Eighty-six percent of the preparation-of-the-new-vegetable 
rules by whites and 92 percent by Negroes referred to 
preparation of new Irish potatoes. 

All preparation-of-new-Irish-potato rules, except two 
given by white homemakers and five given by Negro home- 
makers, pertained to parboiling new Irish potatoes, though 
one of the rules reported by Negroes and two by whites 
would have this parboiling done in soda water. The rule 



i^<The dry peas and beans ordinarily used are dry cowpeas and dry butter 
(lima) beans. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



25 



to parboil new Irish potatoes no doubt resulted from the 
fact that in the past there have been some persons who 
have become ill from eating them. Since new potatoes 
contain more solanin, a substance capable of causing ill- 
ness if taken in large enough quantities, than do old pota- 
toes, it has been generally assumed that it was the solanin 
that caused the illness. However, investigators have shown 
the amount of solanin contained in new potatoes, in amounts 
ordinarily eaten, is insufficient to produce the symptoms 
described. Some potato poisonings have been traced to 
eating potatoes which were green due to exposure to the 
sun, but most of the cases of illness reported are said 
to be due to bacterial infection. New potatoes, because 
of their higher content of water, decompose much more 
readily than old ones. Potatoes cooked one day and kept 
until the next without refrigeration and served unheated, 
are especially good media for bacteria. There would seem 
to be little if any basis for parboiling new Irish potatoes.^^ 

A number of parboiling-new-Irish-potato rules, especial- 
ly those reported by Negro women, gave reasons for par- 
boiling new potatoes, such as "to make healthy,'* "remove 
poison," "get sap out," "keep from making sick." Most of 
the rules given called for pouring off first water and add- 
ing more water to complete cooking, but in several, par- 
boiling a couple of times was mentioned, and in a few, 
parboiling three times. 

The seven other rules (five by Negro homemakers 
and two by white homemakers) for preparation of new 
Irish potatoes called for soaking in cold water after peeling 
"to get sap out," "remove poison substance," or "make 
healthier." 

Twenty-four rules were given referring to new vege- 
tables other than new potatoes (18 by white women, 6 by 
Negro women). Seven white homemakers gave the rule 
"always parboil all new vegetables." No Negro woman

gave this rule. Four white and four Negro homemakers 
gave the rule "always parboil new cabbage." In addition, 
one Negro homemaker gave the following rule : ''Stand new 
cabbage in cold water; they won't make you sick." Three 
white women and one Negro woman gave the rule ''always 
parboil new string beans." In one of the rules given by 
a white woman, it was stated to do this three times. The 
other five rules concerning new vegetables, all given by 
white homemakers, concerned parboiling new butter beans, 
new squash and new peas. 

Beliefs in the evilness of first vegetables seem un- 
usually strong in this group of vegetable preparation rules. 
From this it would seem that teachers of Home Economics 
in the area might well include such traditional beliefs with 
attempts to change food preparation practices such as par- 
boiling and soaking. 

In addition to the parboiling rules for new vegetables 
just discussed, there were 37 other parboiling rules report- 
ed by Negro homemakers and 20 by white homemakers 
classified in group IV. Twenty-three of these rules by 
Negroes and five by whites concerned need for parboiling 
white potatoes. In most of the rules the purpose of this 
parboiling was not stated. One white woman gave "to 
make better." Reasons given by Negro women giving rea- 
sons were: "to prevent poisoning," "to keep from making 
sick," "to remove poisonings," "to get rid of poisons." 
Qualities given the new potato by many women may have 
been attributed to all potatoes by some women. 

Nine rules concerning parboiling strong flavored vege- 
tables such as cabbage and turnip greens, were given by 
Negro women, four by white women. These rules differed 
from those classified in groups II and III in that the aim 
of parboiling was not to reduce strong flavor and make 
taste better, but "to keep from being sick," "to remove 
poison," "let sap out," "take out fever" — an aim similar to 
that often expressed in preparation of new vegetables. 

In addition to the parboiling rules just discussed, there 
were 16 other parboiling rules reported, among which were : 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



27 



'Tarboil all vegetables" (reported by two white and two 
Negro women), ''parboil all fresh vegetables" (reported by 
4 white women), and "parboil string beans and butter 
beans" (reported by 4 white women and 2 Negro women). 
These rules, like the rules for parboiling Irish potatoes, 
may be a transfer from rules concerning need of parboiling 
all new vegetables, new butter beans, or new string beans. 

Rules in group IV are of two general types: (1) Those 
which seem to have aims usual to general cookery — a 
palatable product, i. e., good taste, tenderness, and (2) those 
in which preparation is to be carried on in a specific man- 
ner, as otherwise a discomfort will follow from eating 
the food. Seventy percent of the vegetable rules classified 
in group IV reported by Negroes and 54 percent reported by 
whites seem to be of this second type. The remainder in 
the group seem to be of the first type. 

Other types of rules implying or stating discomfort 
lodged in food, in addition to rules concerning prepara- 
tion of new vegetables and parboiling just discussed, were 
use-of-soda rules, rules pertaining to harvesting, rules con- 
cerning soaking before cooking, and a miscellaneous group^^ 
including, among others, use of a ''lot of fat to keep from 
making sick," "washing in bar soap to draw out fever," and 
"cooking all water out," i. e., the idea of never leaving 
water in vegetables or a particular vegetable, as cooking 
water was not good for one. Is it possible that this could 
be a misinterpretation of the home economics rule "cook 
vegetables in a little water"? 

Forty-three rules reported (42 by Negro women and 
1 by a white woman) concerned use of soda in cooking, or 
soaking in soda water "to keep from forming gas," "to 
keep from getting diarrhea and other diseases," "to remove 
poisons," "to keep from being sick," "to kill poisons," "to 
get fever out," "to make fit to eat," "to prevent illness." 
It is possible that use of soda was associated in the minds 

20Included in this group were two rules for long cooking reported by Negro 
women. Most of the long cooking of vegetable rules implied long cooking to im- 
prove taste. These two stated long cooking "to make healthier" and "get rid of 
poison." 



2 8 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

of some of the Negro homemakers with relieving discom- 
fort and that since discomfort was lodged in the vegetable, 
then adding soda would help the situation. 

Nine harvest rules were reported by Negro women, 
and one by a white woman, implying that there was a 
particular time of day or season that vegetables should 
not be harvested. These rules included: **Do not let the 
sun shine on vegetables the day you cook them." (This 
was reported by three Negro women and one white woman.) 
Other harvest rules reported were: ''Never eat sweetpota- 
toes before frost falls," "never eat collard greens until frost 
falls on them." These potatoes and greens were said '*not 
to be good for one." The fact that sweetpotatoes and col- 
lards have a lower sugar content in summer before they 
are mature possibly explains why they do not taste as 
good. The fact that they do not taste as good then may 
have led to the rule that they are not good for one. 

Five of the rules reported by Negro women and four 
reported by white women pertained to value of soaking, 
or adding water to make the vegetable more healthful to 
eat. Among these were: "Let string beans stand in water 
for an hour before cooking — healthier," "soak cucumbers in 
cold water before serving — takes fever out," "cabbage 
causes sickness unless fever is soaked out of them in salty 
water," "cook vegetables in plenty of water to keep from 
making sick," "always add water to tomatoes in cooking 
so they won't hurt you," "cut onion and set in water to 
avoid indigestion," "if you're going to fry white potatoes, 
peel and let stand in salty water before frying to draw 
poisons out of them." 

In the group including those vegetable preparation rules 
implying aims usual to general cookery which are classi- 
fied in group IV, by far the most common were rules im- 
plying that long cooked vegetables were more tasteful. 
White homemakers gave 106, Negro homemakers 21 such 
rules. It is possible that the tradition for long cooking of 
string beans was recorded because of its great popularity, 
while traditions for long cooking of some of the other vege- 
tables or for all vegetables, being less popular, were not 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



29 



recorded (at least in the cookbooks examined). On the 
other hand, a few women may have read in cookbooks to 
cook string beans 1 to 3 hours, depending on maturity, 
and in passing along the information, merely said "cook 
string beans a long time" — or transferred the idea for 
long cooking of string beans to all vegetables or to par- 
ticular vegetables. 

Fifty-five of the 107 long-cooking-of-vegetable rules 
reported by white homemakers and 9 of the 23 reported 
by Negro homemakers concerned long cooking of string 
beans. Some of the most common of these rules were: 
''Cook string beans until they shrivel," ''let string beans 
cook until they fry," "the longer you cook string beans 
the better they are," "can't cook string beans too much," 
"always cook string beans a long time," "beans have to be 
cooked a long time to be good." 

White women gave 35 rules concerning long cooking 
of all vegetables ; Negro women gave 7. Some of the 
rules most often given were: "The longer you cook vege- 
tables the better flavored they are," "always have vege- 
tables on by 9:00 a.m. and let boil until dinner at noon," 
"gather vegetables early in morning and put on stove im- 
mediately," "cook vegetables a long time to be good." 
Other rules for long cooking of vegetables included seven 
for turnip greens by whites, one by Negroes; eight for 
cabbage by whites, two by Negroes; one for cowpeas by 
whites, two by Negroes. 

The rule of next importance with an aim similar to 
the aim in general cookery classified in group IV was one 
pertaining to the temperature of water in which a vege- 
table should be started to cook. White homemakers gave 
22 of these rules ; Negro homemakers, 3 rules. Eight of 
the rules given by white women called for starting one type 
of vegetable in cold water and another type in hot or boil- 
ing water; i. e., "always put vegetables that grow under 
ground in cold water, above ground in hot water." The re- 
mainder either called for starting all vegetables or a par- 
ticular vegetable in cold water or implied that the reason 
for starting in hot or boiling water was that cold water is 



30 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

toughening. Examples of rules of this latter type include: 
"Never put turnips on in cold water, for it hardens them," 
*Vhen you don't have hot water to add to peas or beans, just 
pour your cold water down side of vessel to keep cold water 
from toughening," ''don't add cold water to vegetables as 
it will toughen them." Nutrition specialists recommend 
starting all vegetables in boiling water (or adding boiling 
water to cooking vegetables should more be needed) in 
order to reduce cooking time and to destroy oxidases. 

Twenty-five of the rules given by Negro homemakers 
and two by white homemakers attributed tendering powers 
to sugar, vinegar, and nails in preparing vegetables. Twen- 
ty-one of the rules reported by Negroes and one by whites 
were: "Put a pinch of sugar" or "a little sugar" or "sugar" 
in vegetables to tender or to cook quicker. This rule may 
have resulted from the fact that sugar and soda were 
often both added and that it was not possible to tell which 
"did the trick." Therefore, properties belonging to soda 
were attributed to sugar or vice versa. The rules "put 
a little vinegar in vegetables to cook quicker" and "drop a 
nail in tough beans to make them cook quicker," given by 
two Negroes and one white, may be examples of apply- 
ing meat preparation rules to vegetable preparation. These 
rules were quite common in meat preparation, as will be 
noted in the discussion which is to follow. 

Also included in the rules classified in group IV as 
having aims usual to general cookery, were 20 concerning 
reducing odors in vegetable preparation (17 reported by 
Negro women, 3 reported by white women). These rules 
may not be food preparation rules in the strict sense, but 
since they occur with preparation of vegetables, they are 
here included. 

Seventeen of the rules applied to reducing odor or bad 
effects from odor of cooking cabbage, and three of the 
rules applied to reducing bad effects from odor of prepar- 
ing onions. The most common rule, given by nine women 
(six Negro women and three white women) was: "When 
cooking cabbage, put a biscuit or a piece of stale lightbread 
on top of the cabbage to keep odor from going through 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



31 



the house." Other rules for reducing odor of cooking cab- 
bage given by Negro women were placing a piece of cut 
onion on top of the cooking cabbage, sprinkling meal on the 
stove, and putting an open pan of water on stove to absorb 
odor. 

According to the rules given by Negro women, one of 
the effects of the odor of cooked cabbage was to draw flies, 
and for this reason it was important to keep down odors. 
"When cooking cabbage, sprinkle a little meal on the stove 
to keep green flies away," "lay a piece of bread on top of 
boiling cabbage to keep flies away," "place a biscuit on 
top of cooking cabbage to keep flies away," are examples of 
such rules. 

Six white women gave time-f or-adding-salt rules ; six 
Negro women use-of-soda-to-improve-taste rules. Five of 
the rules given by white homemakers called for adding 
salt when the vegetable was cooked. One was "add salt 
at beginning in cooking potatoes so won't break up." Food 
specialists recommend adding salt at the beginning in 
cooking potatoes as well as in cooking other vegetables, but 
not for the reason given. Four of the use-of-soda rules 
reported by Negro women applied to improving taste of all 
vegetables by addition of soda, two to improving the taste 
of particular vegetables. Here it is possible that properties 
of sugar were confused with those of soda. 

One interesting rule reported by a white woman and 
classified in this group was "always add soda to string 
beans to take up the grease." This rule might be used as 
a basis in teaching to show that soda not only is destructive 
of vitamins but unites with fat and forms soap, resulting 
in probably a less palatable product and in the use of 
more fat than necessary for seasoning. It was classified 
with rules of group IV, for if beans were too greasy, the 
best way to reduce this greasiness would have been to re- 
duce the amount of grease rather than to add soda. In 
other words, it has little basis. 



32 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

Vegetable Preparation Rules of the Recipe Type 

There were only 50 vegetable preparation rules in- 
cluded in group V, or the rules of the recipe type — 5 report- 
ed by white women, and 45 by Negro women. Of those 
reported by Negro women, 35 were: ''Add sugar to vege- 
tables to make them taste better." P^ive mentioned addi- 
tion of onion and four addition of vinegar to improve flavor. 
One read, ''always cook vegetables with salt meat." 

The rules given by white women and classified in this 
category differed very much from those given by Negro 
women. No white woman mentioned addition of sugar, 
vinegar, or onion to improve flavor. One, however, gave 
the rule "always use salt meat in cooking vegetables." Other 
recipe rules given by white women were: "Season English 
peas with milk and butter," "cabbage always takes less salt 
than any other vegetable," "cabbage needs very little salt," 
"put fat in bottom of boiler with flour and let brown. Add 
vegetable and water at about the same time. You will have 
same effect as though you had used meat." 

Reasons Given for Vegetable Preparation Rules 

About 20 percent of the vegetable rules given by white 
women and 80 percent by Negro women included a reason 
with the rule given (table 6). In both Negro and white 
groups, when a rule contained a reason, this reason was 
most frequently (1) to tender or cook quicker; (2) to make 
more healthful; i. e., keep from making sick, to get rid of 
poison, let sap out; (3) to improve flavor. Flavor was 
given more relative importance by whites ; to tender or cook 
quicker by Negroes. It is possible that Negro women were 
more limited as to fuel (usually wood) than were white 
homemakers. Also, food preparation may have been an 
extra activity more often to Negro mothers than white 
mothers, and for this reason speed was more important. In 
interviewing homemakers the writer has found that lack 
of other activities sometimes accounts for long cooking. 

It is interesting to see that so few women in reporting 
vegetable preparation rules taught by mother or someone

else at home gave *'to conserve vitamins," or "to make 
more nutritious" (table 6). When these same homemakers, 
however, were asked: (1) to give new vegetable dishes tried 
during previous year and what led them to try new dishes, 
and (2) to account for some of the differences in preparation 
of particular vegetables in own and in parental home, 
the superior nutritive value of the new dish or new method 
of preparation was frequently mentioned."^ This would 
indicate that preparation to conserve nutrients is on the 
increase. Cooking to conserve nutrients would be expected

now. Fifteen, twenty, or thirty years ago, available nutri- 
tion information was limited, or almost nonexistent. 

Meat, Poultry, Fish Preparation Rules 

Three hundred and six rules taught concerning prepara- 
tion of meat, poultry, and fish were reported by white and 
Negro homemakers of this study, 110 by whites and 196 
by Negroes. Two hundred and fifty-seven were rules given 
for preparation of meat and meat products, 36 for the 
preparation of poultry (in practically all cases, chicken), 
9 for preparation of both meat and poultry, and 4 for the 
preparation of fish. 

As will be noted from the classification of meat, fish, 
and poultry rules in table 7, the majority (except the older 
Negro group) were classified in group II or in the group 
in accord with directions found in old cookbooks examined 
and now outdated. More of the rules reported by the 
older Negro group were rules that seemed to have little or 
no basis. Younger women reported more rules in accord 
with practices now recommended, while older women re- 
ported more that seemed to have but little or no basis. 

MEAT, POULTRY, AND FISH PREPARATION RULES 
IN ACCORD WITH PRACTICES NOW RECOMMENDED 

White women gave 14 rules, Negro women 13 rules 
which included practices now recommended by nutrition 
specialists. Twenty-three of these rules pertained to cook- 
ing at low temperature (or slow cooking) , 3 concerned short 
cooking, and 1 was a negative rule : "Never salt chicken un- 
til it is ready to cook." Formerly, when cooling facilities 
were very poor, dressing and salting both inside and out- 
side of the chicken a day before cooking was common. How- 
ever, salting ahead no doubt dissolved nutrients, especially 
if the skin was broken which was more than likely the 
case since defeathering was usually done by plunging the 
fowl in boiling water. 

Twelve meat, fish, and poultry rules reported by 
Negroes and 13 reported by whites classified in group I 
were in accord with technical recommendations of food 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



35 



specialists and suggested cooking meat (or tough meat) 
with cover to tender, dressing poultry ahead to tender, 
freezing to tender, cooking with less water to improve 
flavor, using little fat in broiling, care against overpricking 
meat in testing, sticking in nails to cook more quickly. 

Rules pertaining to the use of a small amount of water 
in cooking meat were classified in group I even though 
addition of water is not recommended in cooking tender 
meat. It seemed very likely that most of the meat secured 
by the families of these women was tough, since the ma- 
jority lived on farms or in small towns where a supply 
of tender meat was usually not available. Rules such as 
''always keep lid tight on meats — tenderer" were likewise 
classified in group I, though they apply in particular to 
tough meats. In 74 of the rules given by Negro home- 
makers and in 6 given by white homemakers, tough meat 
or tough chicken was specifically mentioned. 

One interesting type of rules reported only by Negro 
women in this study was a rule concerning use of nails or 
rusty nails in cooking, to tender or cook quicker. In most 
of the rules these nails must be put in the meat or chicken, 
but a few suggested that they be dropped in the pot. Since 
food investigators have shown that metal skewers inserted 
in meat do cause meat to cook quicker, the three rules of 
this type were classed in group However, the majority 
of rules referred to putting nails in meat to tender, or to 
putting nails in the pot with meat or chicken to cook quick- 
er or to tender. These rules were classified in group IV, 
or as rules having little or no basis. 

Use of nails in meat cooking may have come from the 
practice of cooking meat over coals on metal skewers — 
a practice before cook stoves were common. It is likely 
that these metal skewers were rusty and so the nail or

the rusty nail was substituted when cooking on a stove. 
In other words, an old practice might be followed in a 
changed form when new equipment appears even though 
not necessary or desirable. 

Meat, Poultry, and Fish Preparation Rules in Accord With 
Directions Found in Old Cookbooks Examined, Now 

Outdated 

As will be noted in table 7, practically all meat, poul- 
try, and fish preparation rules in group II were outdated 
because better technical methods have been developed, or 
because of changes in processing. The five rules given 
outdated because of increased knowledge of nutrition (four 
reported by Negro women, one by a white woman) per- 
tained to washing chicken in soda water before cooking, 
soaking liver 30 minutes before frying to draw out the 
blood, and parboiling brains. 

The majority of meat rules classified in group II con- 
cerned adding vinegar (and in a very few cases lemon 
juice) to tender. This rule was reported by 62 Negro 
and 4 white women. Perhaps, if the practice had been 
as common a tradition among white families, it would have 
been found in more than one of the cookbooks examined 
and been assigned a place in the meat section of the cook- 
book in which it was found, rather than in the back of the 
book with "Facts Worth Knowing."-'^ 

The use-of-vinegar rules reported by homemakers of 
this study called for rubbing a little vinegar on meat or 
chicken, or for washing meat in vinegar water, or for 
putting a little vinegar in the pot during cooking. Only 
one rule given — that by a white woman — called for marinat- 
ing overnight. According to investigations made at Iowa 
State College,-^ the effect of adding acid to meat for in- 
creasing tenderness depends primarily on the length of 
time the acid is in contact with the meat. The vinegar- 
treated beef was decidedly more tender than the control

after being marinated for 72 hours, using vinegar solu- 
tions (25 c.c. of vinegar and 75 c.c. of water per 100 grams 
of meat). However, the concentration of the acid was 
much greater near the surface than in the interior of the 



38 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

meat, showing that even 72 hours is not enough time for 
the vinegar to penetrate sufficiently into the meat to bring 
about equilibrium of acid in the meat. Putting a little 
vinegar on the meat or in the pot or washing with a little 
vinegar would, therefore, not make it tender. 

White women gave 17 rules, Negro women 6, concerning 
need for starting meat in boiling water or in a hot skillet 
to keep in the juices. All old cookbooks examined gave the 
searing-to-keep-in- juices rule. In her recipe for roast beef, 
Harland, for example, stated: "It is a good plan to dash a 
small cup of boiling water over meat when putting it into 
oven — checks escape of juices."-^ By 1935, research work 
had definitely disproved the theory of searing to keep in 
juices. 

Six rules given by white homemakers and five by Negro 
homemakers concerned need for adding salt after meat was 
tender, since salt toughened or let out the flavor. Similar 
rules were found in the White House cookbook which stat- 
ed: 'It hardens any meat to salt when it is raw,'*"® and 
the Boston cookbook, ''Salt draws out the juices."-^ The 
Department of Home Economics of the National Livestock 
and Meat Board recommends salt added to broiled meat 
after browning. They state it makes little difference when 
a roast is salted. Salting any piece of meat cooked by 
moist heat at the beginning of the cooking period is recom- 
mended by them.-- 

Four meat rules given are outdated (three referring to 
parboiling salt pork and one to boiling ham) because of 
the use of less salt in curing. Parboiling or cooking in 
large quantities of water is no longer necessary as in 
the past. Ham is now baked at low temperature with no 
water.

TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



39 



Meat, Poultry, and Fish Preparation Rules in Accord with 
Observation But Not Found in Old Cookbooks 
Examined, Now Outdated 

There were only 19 meat, poultry, and fish rules classi- 
fied in group III, or as rules based on observation but not 
in accord with present recommendations. All except two 
were outdated because of better technical development or 
changes in processing. Both were "always parboil wild 
meats." Deer was probably referred to in these two cases, 
for the ''gamey" taste of venison was mentioned as un- 
desirable by several in connection with another phase of 
this same study. 

Fourteen of the 19 rules classified in group III per- 
tained to boiling meat then baking (or browning) in oven. 
This procedure, it was said by those giving a reason with 
the rule, made tender meat. The method of cooking tough 
meat recommended by food preparation specialists is brais- 
ing. Browning at the beginning of the cooking period is 
an essential part of braising. In braising, the meat is 
browned in its own fat or in a small amount of added fat. 
The browning is usually done on the top of the stove, but 
may be done in the oven. Liquid may or may not be added. 
If it is added, only a small amount is used. After browning, 
the heat is reduced, the container tightly covered, and 
cooking continued. 

No recipe could be found in the old cookbooks examin- 
ed of boiling and then browning meat in the oven, except 
in the case of cured ham and of turkey. It is possible that 
the method used in preparing cured ham was applied to 
other meats such as fresh pork and beef. It is interesting 
to note that no Negro woman gave the boiling and baking 
rule. Perhaps this was a special cooking tradition of fairly 
well-to-do families ordinarily preparing large roasts and/or 
turkey. 

Three rules were given by Negro women pertaining to 
use of "lots of water" or "plenty of water" and "long cook- 
ing" to tender. Such procedure would tender but would 
produce poorer flavor than if cooked in little water. 



4 0 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

Meat, Poultry, and Fish Preparation Rules Seeming" to Have 
But Little or No Basis 

Negro women gave six rules, white women only one, 
stating or implying that the aim in cooking meat or par- 
ticular kinds of meat was to make it healthful to eat. 
This type of rule was, therefore, relatively unimportant for 
preparation of meats, but, as will be recalled, important for 
preparation of vegetables. Three of these rules pertained to 
washing chicken in soapy water to remove germs. 

Of those meat rules classified in group IV and whose 
aim seemed to be that usual in cookery; i. e., a tender, 
palatable product, by far the most important reported by 
white women, concerned the need for long cooking of meat : 
''Always cook meats a long time," ''always cook meat 
until it falls apart," "always cook meat until thoroughly 
done," "can't cook fresh pork too much," and "can't boil 
meat too much." 

Long-cooking meat rules may have come from need 
for long cooking of pork to destroy trichinae. However, 
one can cook even pork too much. Any overcooking of meat 
reduces nutritive value as well as makes the meat less 
palatable and less attractive in appearance. It is common 
observation that the great majority of people in the South 
prefer meat very well done. This preference no doubt 
came in part from the fact that the South was largely rural, 
consequently using a large amount of pork which could be 
easily produced on the farm. 

The meat rule reported by more Negro women than 
any other classified in group IV, concerned putting nails in 
meat to tender or dropping in pot for tendering or cooking 
quicker. Sixteen of the 26 rules here given mentioned 
rusty nails. The investigators, Morgan, Child, and Cover, 
as has been previously stated, have shown that use of 
metal skewers in meat cookery reduces cooking time and 
cooking losses, but Cover has shown in her study that 
meat cooked with metal skewers is not as tender as the 
control."^ Therefore, putting a nail or a rusty nail in meat 
to tender has no basis. 



29See reference in footnote 2 J. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



41 



Negro women gave 25 rules, white women 1 rule, for 
use of soda in cooking or in washing meat in order to tender. 
These rules may have been carried over from use-of-soda 
rules in vegetable cookery. Addition of soda during cooking 
or washing in soda water before cooking will not make 
meat tender. Soda will increase destruction of thiamin. 

Six rules for use of sugar in meat to tender or cook 
quicker were given by Negro women. Sugar will not tender 
meat any more than it will tender vegetables. It would 
seem that a few of the Negro mothers associated soda and 
sugar with tendering, not only of vegetables, but of other 
foods, such as meat and chicken. 

Among other rules classified in group IV were those 
attributing properties to oven cooking, to the use of the 
lid, starting in hot water, refraining from sticking a fork in 
meat, that such ways of preparation did not have. Cook- 
ing inside stove or in oven was said by two white women 
and one Negro woman to make meat «iore juicy or give 
better flavor, one and the same, since meat flavor is mostly 
in the juice. Retaining juice depends on the temperature, 
not place of cooking. One rule given by a white woman 
stated that cooking beefsteak without lid and adding a lit- 
tle water would make tender. One rule reported by a 
Negro woman stated that putting on lid guaranteed ten- " 
derness. Cooking with a lid would help make meat tender, 
but certainly would not guarantee it. One Negro woman 
reported that cooking meat without sticking a fork in it 
would make it tender, while a white woman stated that 
starting meat in cold water would toughen it. Neither 
statement is true. 

Meat, Poultry, and Fish Preparation Rules of the 
Recipe Type 

There were only 15 meat, poultry, and fish prepara- 
tion rules included in group V, or rules of the recipe type — 
5 reported by white women, 10 by Negro women. Seven of 
these rules reported by Negroes and two by whites referred 
to addition of vinegar or lemon juice for improving taste. 
The other three rules given by Negro women concerned put- 



42 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 



ting a little sugar in meat to make taste better, while the 
other three reported by whites concerned addition of par- 
ticular vegetables in cooking meat, and to rubbing beef- 
steak with olive oil before broiling. 

Reasons Given for Meat, Poultry, and Fish Preparation Rules 

As is shown in table 8, to tender was the reason most 
often accompanying meat rules reported by both white and 
Negro women, although Negroes mentioned to tender about 
two times as often as whites. Cooking quicker was next in 
importance to Negroes to keep juices in, or make juicier to 
whites. 

It is interesting to note that nutritive value was not 
mentioned by any woman, white or Negro, in connection 
with meat, poultry, and fish preparation rules. As will

TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES

be recalled, it was mentioned by very few in vegetable 
preparation rules. It is only recently that methods have 
been worked out for studying vitamin losses in meat prepa- 
ration. Then, too, in preparing meat the cooking water 
(or gravy) is eaten, not thrown out as vegetable cooking 
water often is. 

CAKE PREPARATION RULES 

There were 80 cake preparation rules given by the 
1,158 homemakers of this study — 76 by white women and 
4 by Negro women (table 9) . Three of the four cake rules 
given by Negro women were accompanied by a reason — 
one in order to make lighter and two in order to keep cake 
from falling. Sixteen of the 76 cake preparation rules 
reported by white women were accompanied by a reason — 
7 to keep cake from falling, 4 to make a smoother or better 
texture, 4 to cook or rise more evenly, and 1 to make a 
better cake. It would thus seem that keeping from falling 
is as important in cake preparation as making tender is in 
vegetable and meat preparation. 

It is interesting to note that all 27 rules classified as in 
accord with practices now recommended were technical 
recommendations. No rule concerning a nutrition recom- 
mendation was given. This was, no doubt, because it is 
only recently that methods for determining vitamin Bi have 
been worked out and that investigations on the effect of 
baking powder and soda on this vitamin have been made. 

That there was no rule reported concerning the effect 
of excess soda or baking powder on taste and texture may 
be accounted for by the fact that cakes are prepared 
by recipe, since hit-and-miss proportions are likely to make 
the cake fall. 

The conventional method of preparing a cake taught by 
home economists is to cream fat, add sugar gradually, then 
egg yolks. After that, add the sifted flour, baking powder, 
and salt mixture alternately with the liquid, beginning and 
ending with the former, and finally stirring in beaten 
whites.

Sixteen of the 27 cake rules classified in group I were 
tests for doneness. Thirteen were: "Put broomstraw in 
cake and if it comes out clean, cake is done." The two other 
tests for doneness rules classified in this group were : "Cakes 
are done when they turn loose from the side of the pan," 
"in touching a cake, you leave fingerprints if it isn't done." 
Two women gave this latter rule.^^ 

Five of the other 11 cake rules classified in group I 
concerned creaming butter and sugar thoroughly. Two 
pertained to time of adding flour and liquid; i. e., "Never 
put liquid in cake batter until flour is added," "always 
start with flour and end with flour in making cakes." The 
other four rules, the first reported by a Negro woman, were: 
"Beat egg whites separately. Fold in last. Makes cake 
lighter," "always cook cake at beginning at lower tempera- 
ture, then raise temperature," "let cake set after taking out 
of oven a while before icing," "if you use too much sugar 

30These three tests are mentioned in scientific food preparation books, such 
as "Hows and Whys of Cooking" by Halliday and Noble. However, it is stated 
that the cake should shrink only slightly ; that if it shrinks too badly, it is over- 
baked and that the cake should be touched "lightly with the fingers." 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES

in cake, it falls." All of these rules conform with instruc- 
tions of food specialists.^^ 

There were three types of cake rules classified in the 
group in accord with directions found in old cookbooks 
examined, but now outdated because of better technical 
methods. Six of these rules concerned the need for beating 
cake batter thoroughly, or for a long time. Three stated: 
''Don't open door to oven when cake is baking, makes fall." 
Two were: ''Beat cake batter; never stir." Similar state- 
ments found in the old cookbooks examined were: "All 
cakes made with butter require to be beaten long and 
vigorously after adding flour that they may be smooth 
grained,"^- "the cake should be quickly examined and the 
door shut carefully. The rush of cold air will cause it to 
fall," "never stir cake after butter and sugar are creamed 
but beat it up and over. This laps air into batter and 
produces little air cells. "^^ 

Twenty of the 38 cake preparation rules classified in 
group IV concerned warnings against running around in 
the kitchen when the cake was baking, as the jar would 
make the cake fall. According to Mrs. Snyder of the Wheat 
Flour Institute, it would take a very severe "shake" to 
accomplish this. "If the bread is extremely rich, like 
cake, there might possibly be some tendency for it to fall 
if it were jolted at the critical moment."^^ This rule would, 
therefore, seem to have but little basis. Fallen cakes have, 
without doubt, been frequently blamed on playing children 
when the cause was inaccurate measuring, poor mixing, or 
baking procedures. 

Four rules in group IV concerned need for baking very 
slowly or at a low temperature. According to food special- 
ists, cake baked at slow temperature has thicker cell walls, 
a coarser and less velvety texture. 

Another four rules in this group concerned beating 
cake batter; i. e., "Can't beat cakes too much" (reported

of Chicago Press, 1936, Ch. IV.

by two women), "the more you beat your cake, the smoother 
the texture," ''don't beat cake batter" (reported by one 
each) . Halliday states that plain cake with phosphate bak- 
ing powder cannot be beaten longer than 1 minute, cake 
with tartrate baking powder 2 minutes, whereas cake with 
sulfate phosphate powder will stand 10 minutes.^'^ 

Attention may be called here to the total lack or over- 
lap between tradition and use of materials, such as baking 
powder. Even though it has been 23 years since Halliday 
published the article on "The Effect of Beating Cake Made 
with Different Baking Powder," no mention was made in 
rules reported of any difference in procedure when using 
different types of baking powder. Food rules passed on 
from mothers to daughters of this study, no matter what 
the food, seldom contained specific methods of procedure. 
Perhaps one explanation for the large number of vegetable 
rules reported was that in vegetable preparation greater 
latitude of procedure is possible. 

Information given in rules of the recipe type was itself 
usually most general, i. e., "Add a little sugar to string beans 
to make taste better," "season English peas with milk 
and butter," "a little vinegar added to meat improves its 
flavor." The four rules of the recipe type given for cake, 
in three cases, "use the 1-2-3-4 recipe in making cakes," 
and in one case "in making cakes use the 1-2-3-4 rule, only 
use V2 cup of fat instead of 1 cup," were somewhat more 
specific though there was likelihood of forgetting whether 
the three applied to eggs or to cups of flour.^^ 

The other 10 cake rules classified in group IV seem-

Jour. Horn Econ., Vol. 12, p. 42, (1920). 

Sf'In the discussion given by Belle Lowe in her "Experimental Cookery," 
1943 Edition, pp. 514-15, on balancing cake formulas, she states; "Bakers have 
different rules for balancing cake formulas, but they state that there will always 
be exceptions to these rules. They also mix larger quantities in one batch than 
the housewife. It is well known that in large-quantity cookery the proportion of 
liquid must be decreased. In many instances, the rules given in bakery trade 
journals sift down to the following or similar suggestions : ( 1 ) The weight of the 
fat should not be over one-half the weight of the sugar; (2) the weight of the 
fat should not exceed the weight of the eggs; (3) the weight of the sugar should 
not exceed the weight of the flour; (4) the weight of the liquid (milk plus eggs) 
should equal the weight of the flour. 

The 1-2-3-4 rule, it was found, is 1 cup fat, 2 cups sugar, 3 eggs, 4 cups 
flour. Usually 1 cup of milk is added. Compared with suggestions above, it will 
be found that the weight of the fat exceeds the weight of eggs. However, in one 
of the four rules given, one woman stated : "In making cakes use the 1-2-3-4 rule, 
only use ^ cup of fat instead of 1 cup." This would seem to be more in line 
with the formula above.

ing to have little or no basis varied widely. Three refer- 
red to putting a pan of cold water in the oven when baking 
a cake, to cook more evenly. Two advised folding in bak- 
ing powder last. Two gave tests for sufficiency of mix- 
ing; i. e., 'Test cake batter by dropping it in cold water. 
Ready to bake if dough will float." The other three rules 
were as follows: ''Always shake cake pan after putting in 
the oven to make cake rise evenly," ''have thin batter to 
make a good cake," "always put spices and seasoning in 
before measuring flour in making cake." In the case of 
the first rule listed at the beginning of the paragraph, 
putting a pan of cold water in an oven that was too hot 
for the cake would reduce the temperature. However, 
according to Monroe, steam causes cracking of certain cakes 
due to faster heating of the surface.^' 

BREAD PREPARATION RULES 

Forty-five rules concerning preparation of breads were 
reported — 42 by white homemakers and 3 by Negro home- 
makers. The fact that so few Negro women reported bread 
preparation rules taught may have been because bread in 
parental homes of many of these women was mostly corn- 
bread made with meal, salt, water, and fat. Preparation of 
this bread probably provoked few rules since there was 
no problem such as of toughness or of poison to destroy. 

Twenty-six of the bread rules concerned preparation 
of cornbread, 13 of biscuit, 5 of yeast bread, and 1 of both 
biscuits and cornbread. 

As may be noted in table 10, all bread preparation 
rules classified in group I were technical recommendations, 
as were cake rules in this group. One bread rule, how- 
ever, classified in group V, "Always use teaspoon soda 
to 1 cup sour milk in making cornbread," might have been 
placed in group I and classed as a nutrition recommendation 
since the proportion of soda to acid is important, for an 
excess of soda is destructive of vitamin Bi in the cornmeal. 
One-half teaspoon of soda to a cup of sour milk is accord-

ing to proportions recommended by the Nutrition Specialist 
of the Mississippi Extension Service.^^ 

Nine of the 20 bread rules classified in group I, or 
rules in accord with practices now recommended by food 
specialists, concerned starting cornbread or biscuit in a 
hot oven and/or cooking quickly (table 10). (It is quick 
rising which is largely responsible for lightness of well- 
made breads; and lightness, in turn, largely determines 
the grain and texture of baked products.) Four rules per- 
tained to kind of dough or batter ; i. e., soft or thin. These 
rules, too, have a scientific basis. A dry dough tends to 
crumble and break, making biscuits that split badly at 
the sides during the baking period.

Among other bread rules classified in group I were: 
"Always have muffin pans hot before putting cornbread 
on," ''always turn corn muffins over as soon as taken out 
of oven," ''good biscuits are the result of working with 
the hands," "measure all ingredients for biscuits," "al- 
ways chill dough before making biscuits."-'^ 

Two of the four bread rules classified in group II con- 
cerned mixing cornmeal, salt, and sour milk ahead and 
adding soda and fat later. The other two were: "Never 
use hot water in making rolls," and "always let yeast bread 
set overnight to make lighter." Similar rules found in 
cookbooks examined were: "One cup of flour, one cup of 
cornmeal, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, water to make a 
thick batter or sour milk is better; mix at night; in the 
morning add 2 tablespoonfuls of fat and 1 teaspoonful of 
soda,"^*^ "one pint lukewarm water,"^^ (Modern recipes call 
for heating water and/or milk to boiling, adding fat and 
sugar, cooling to lukewarm before adding yeast), "cover 
closely that neither dust nor air can get in, and set in a 
warm place. It will rise in 8 or 9 hours. In the morning 
shape into loaves or rolls."*^ 

There were only two bread preparation rules classified 
in group III: "Burn red corn cob to make soda for making 
biscuits," and "always use heavy iron skillet in making 
cornbread." Burning a red corn cob would produce potas- 
sium and sodium carbonate instead of sodium bicarbonate. 
One would get carbon dioxide, but corn cob soda would not 
be very satisfactory. A heavy iron skillet was used in days 
of fireplace cooking and this was undoubtedly a tradition 
carried over from that period. 

Six of the bread preparation rules reported seemed to 
have little or no basis. Two contained warnings against 
jarring the floor when yeast breads were rising (already

discussed in connection with cake). Some of the others 
were : ''Always measure dry ingredients for making biscuit 
before sifting," "the quicker you bake cornbread, the bet- 
ter it is," ''always let biscuit dough set overnight to make 
lighter." One is supposed to use a quick oven in cooking 
cornbread, but it is possible to have the oven too hot. The 
last rule mentioned may have been carried over from recipes 
for biscuit with yeast added. However, in Mississippi, 
when the word "biscuit" is used, reference is ordinarily 
made to soda or baking powder biscuit, or biscuit made with 
both soda and baking powder, not yeast. 

The thirteen rules of the recipe type, with the ex- 
ception already discussed, all referred to putting eggs or 
not putting eggs, or to putting buttermilk, or water, or 
eggs and buttermilk, in cornbread. One interesting rule of 
the recipe type was: "Always make cornbread with just 
milk, as bread with eggs is not good when cold." 

FOOD PRESERVATION RULES 

There were only 21 food preservation rules reported, 
18 by whites and 3 by Negroes. Five of these rules were 
classified in group I; nine in group III; three in group IV; 
and the remainder in group V. The small number of food 
preservation rules given may be because food preservation 
was more often done by recipes. If good directions are 
not carefully followed in food preservation, foods will spoil. 

Three of the five rules classified in group I concerned 
jelly-making (all rules containing technical recommenda- 
tions) : "Always cook a small amount of jelly at one time," 
"when it boils in large bubbles, jelly is done," "always drain 
juice for jelly through a flannel bag; never squeeze; always 
let drip." Draining juice through a flannel bag and never 
squeezing would make a clear jelly. This rule is placed in 
group I on the assumption that clearness is a quality de- 
sired. 

The other two rules (also technical rules) classified in 
group I concerned pickle-making and were: "Never put 
hand in brine, for it spoils cucumber. Use a wooden spoon," 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



51 



"always put grape leaves over cucumber pickles to make 
greener." Putting a hand in the brine might cause spoilage 
if the hand were not clean, especially if the acidity of the 
brine were low. Food specialists recommend addition of 
acid or vinegar in brining cucumbers, since this reduces 
spoilage.^^ It is probable that the cucumbers would absorb 
some of the chlorophyll from the grape leaves and, there- 
fore, the second statement can be classified in group I. 

Five women reported : 'Try fresh pork. Pack in stone 
jars. Pour grease over it. Tie tightly and store in cool 
place. This is good for a month." This rule was classified 
as based on observation, but not in accord with present 
recommendations (group III). When this rule was hand- 
ed down from mothers to daughters, steam pressure can- 
ners were not available; the rule was in all cases reported 
by older women. Food specialists now recommend that 
fresh pork be canned by the steam pressure method or put 
in the cold storage locker. 

Other preservation rules classified in group III were: 
"Always use a brass kettle in making pickles," "put kraut 
up in rain water to make it keep," "always let fruit stand 
in sugar overnight for preserving." Use of a brass con- 
tainer in making pickle would tend to make pickle greener 
since brass is an alloy containing copper. Copper, how- 
ever, is destructive of vitamin C. Minerals contained in 
well water no doubt often interfered with fermentation 
of kraut and thus the rule for making kraut with rain 
water. 

The last rule — "Always let fruit stand in sugar over 
night for preserving" — was outdated because of increased 
knowledge of nutrition as well as development of better 
technical methods. Standing overnight in sugar was done 
to give the juice time to come out of the fruit and make 
addition of water unnecessary. However, flavor was not 
improved thereby as was probably intended. Modern can- 
ning research shows the shorter the time from orchard

pp. 95-96. 



52 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

to jar, the better the flavor and the less the loss of valuable 
nutrients. 

There were three food preservation rules placed in 
group IV: ''Cook jelly until it strings," "when canning, 
turn hot jars bottom upward to make them seal well," 
"pickle will spoil if the maker is menstruating at time of 
putting them up." The latter rule is probably one of the 
taboos in connection with menstruous women handling food 
and/or cooking food.^* 

Three of the four rules of the recipe type concerned 
time for setting cucumbers and watermelon rind in brine 
before making pickles. The other, also a pickle prepara- 
tion rule, was "use 9-day method of pickling peaches." This 
method was probably heating and pouring hot vinegar- 
sugar sirup over peaches each morning for 9 days. 

OTHER FOOD PREPARATION RULES 

White women reported 17 rules, Negro women 18, per- 
taining to preparation of foods or food types not already 
discussed. Included in this list were: butter, buttermilk 
(or sour milk), cottage cheese, fruits, fats, mayonnaise, 
cereals, starchy foods, pastry, meringue, salad, eggs, candy, 
and coffee. Sixteen of these 35 rules were classified in 
group I, 2 in group II, 3 in group III, and the remainder 
(14 in number) in group IV. 

Six of the 16 rules concerning preparation of other 
foods classified in group I were rules for fruit preparation. 
Four were recommendations of nutrition specialists, two 
were technical recommendations. An example of the former 
type is: "Bake apples with skins on;" of the latter type, 
"To keep bananas or cut apples from turning dark, put a 
few drops of lemon juice on them." This latter rule is 
probably nutritionally sound as well as technical, since 
lemon juice apparently delays oxidation and hence destruc- 
tion of vitamin C. 

Among other rules classified in group I were: "Always

145-4(i. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 53 

make coffee just before using and have pot spotlessly 
clean," ''clear up fats by straining and pouring in clean 
can," ''chill pie crust before rolling, so it will be tender." 
This last rule, however, may not apply in all cases. Ac- 
cording to Halliday, "The fat and flour mixture" or "if 
necessary the dough before rolling should be chilled, if 
fat shows a tendency to melt."^"'* Chilling dough was, no 
doubt, desirable in kitchens of mothers passing on these 
rules, since much of the cooking was done in very warm 
kitchens. Kitchens were warm because wood and coal 
ranges were used and because of the climate in Mississippi 
where most of the mothers resided. 

The two rules concerning preparation of "other" foods 
classified in group II were: "Always cook boiled eggs a 
long time to make digestible" and "put an egg shell in coffee 
to clear." The first is outdated because of increased knowl- 
edge of nutrition and the second outdated because with 
coffee dripolators and percolators one no longer has the 
problem of clearing coffee. Statements similar to the two 
given which were found in the old cookbooks examined 
were: "Put eggs in hot water to cover and boil 20 minutes. 
Ten minutes will boil them hard, but they are not so 
digestible as when boiled 20 minutes. Ten minutes makes 
yolks hard and soggy. Twenty minutes makes them light 
and mealy."^" "Coffee (common coffeepot) : 1 heaping 
tablespoon ground coffee, 1 square inch isinglass or 1 egg 
shell, 1 cup boiling water."^' 

All three rules classified in group III concerned warn- 
ings against making candy on a rainy day or in rainy 
weather. One stated in the rule given : "It won't get hard." 
We know, of course, that concentrated sugar solutions, such 
as candy, do absorb moisture from the air. However, food 
specialists now recommend cooking candy to a higher tem- 
perature in rainy or damp weather. 

The 14 rules concerning preparation of "other" foods 
or food types classified in group IV were quite heterogenous.

46Parloa, op. cit., p. 374. 
^"Lincoln, op. cit., p. 115. 



54 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

Four concerned ways to make butter come, or milk sour, 
quickly. All of these four rules were reported by Negro 
women and were : **Drop a teaspoon in milk to make it sour," 
**put a rusty nail in the churn to make the butter come" 
(reported by two women), and "put a little soda in milk 
when churning to make butter come quick." Adding soda 
to milk when churning might have the opposite effect from 
the one stated. There is no basis known to the writer for 
the first two statements. 

Three of the 14 rules classified in group IV concerned 
starting starchy foods or rice in cold water. Three per- 
tained to the use or preparation of fats, one to preparation 
of mayonnaise. The remaining were: "Put a pinch of bak- 
ing powder in meringue to keep it from falling," "pie crust 
made with milk is- tenderer," "bake apples a long time." 
There is little, if any, basis for these statements. 

PREPARATION RULES APPLYING TO ALL FOODS 

The women of this study reported 27 rules that applied 
to no particular food or food type. Twenty of these rules 
were given by white homemakers, seven by Negro home- 
makers. Thirteen of the 27 rules were classified in group 
I, 10 in group IV, and 4 in group V. 

Three of those in group I pertained to short cooking of 
all foods: "Take up foods as soon as tender," "don't cook 
foods too long, makes mushy," "don't overcook food." "Cover 
all foods when cooking" was another rule containing a 
recommendation with some nutritional significance, since 
cooking with a lid conserves vitamins as well as fuel. 

Among rules containing technical recommendations 
classified in group I were : "Always serve hot foods hot and 
cold foods cold," "whenever food scorches, remove from the 
fire and set in vessel of cold water to take out scorched 
taste" (when food cools quickly, the scorched taste does 
not penetrate through the food), "always follow recipes 
accurately," "always measure accurately all ingredients." 

Seven of the 10 rules classified in group IV concerned 
long cooking, simmering, and/or slow cooking of all foods. 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES 



55 



Two included the often heard, ''Too many cooks spoil the 
stew." The other was : 'Test oven by putting hand in before 
baking any kind of food." The test for an oven without a 
thermometer usually given is the time it takes to brown 
a particular amount of flour. 

The rule, "use plenty of seasoning in food," reported 
by two women in slightly different versions, and a rule 
calling for the addition of sugar, and another for the addi- 
tion of salt to every food cooked were the four included in 
group V. 

Summary 

The purpose of this report was to analyze 1,499 food 
preparation rules taught to 1,158 small town homemakers 
of Mississippi (698 white women and 460 Negro women) 
by their mothers or someone else in their parental home, 
as a basis for better understanding of food preparation 
practices now prevalent. 

Median grade completed at school by white homemak- 
ers included was the twelfth; by Negro homemakers the 
sixth. Thirty-two percent of the white homemakers and 12 
percent of the Negro homemakers had had training in a 
cooking class in public school and/or college. 

About one-half of the white homemakers and eight- 
tenths of the Negro homemakers gave the interviewers one 
or more food preparation rules which they had been taught. 
More older women than younger women reported one or 
more rules taught. About 64 percent of the preparation 
rules given by white homemakers and 68 percent by Negro 
homemakers concerned preparation of vegetables. 

More rules concerning preparation of particular vege- 
tables were reported by white than by Negro women. Both 
groups mentioned particular vegetables more often than 
particular meats. The tendency to particularize vegetables 
more than meats, and especially on the part of white women, 
is thought to be because of greater variety of vegetables 
used. However, there was apparently a trend away from 
rules mentioning particular foods to rules mentioning food 



56 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

types since relatively more of the rules given by younger 
homemakers concerned food types; i. e., vegetables, cakes, 
meats. 

Eleven percent of all preparation rules reported by 
white women and 3 percent of all reported by Negro women 
were negative rules. Three-fourths of the negative rules 
reported by white women and two-thirds by Negro women 
represent the more modern attitudes and beliefs, a much 
bigger proportion than in case of positive rules. These 
negative rules are probably associated with conscious cul- 
tural change, such as is involved in modern home economics 
education. . 

A classification of preparation rules by possible source, 
i. e., (1) oral tradition, (2) out-of-date written tradition, 
(3) scientific rule, was attempted but not found practical, 
since the source of the majority of rules was not determin- 
ed. In this classification, rules accompanied with reasons 
implying unwholesome qualities in foods were classified as 
oral tradition. Rules appearing in old cookbooks examined, 
but now outdated because of increased knowledge of nutri- 
tion or development of better technical methods or changes 
in processing, were classified as out-of-date written tradi- 
tion. Scientific food preparation rules were those in ac- 
cord with present recommendations of nutrition and food 
specialists including nutritional and technical recommenda- 
tions. On the basis of this classification by source, there 
seemed to be a tendency for younger white and Negro home- 
makers to report more often recommendations of nutrition 
and food specialists, for older white women to report more 
frequently out-of-date written material, and for older Negro 
women to report oral tradition accompanied with reasons 
inferring that unwholesome qualities exist in food that must 
be removed by preparation. 

The food preparation rules reported by the home- 
makers of this study were classified into five groups for 
analysis: (1) Preparation rules which are in accord with 
practices now recommended by nutrition and food special- 
ists; (2) preparation rules which are in accord with direc- 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULE5) 



57 



tions found in old cookbooks examined, but are now out- 
dated because of increased knowledge of nutrition or better 
technical methods or changes in processing; (3) prepara- 
tion rules which are in accord with observation but not 
found in old cookbooks examined which are now out-of- 
date because of increased knowledge of nutrition or better 
technical methods or changes in processing; (4) prepara- 
tion rules seeming to have little or no basis; and (5) prepa- 
ration rules of the recipe type. 

The majority of rules reported by all groups (white 
and Negro, older and younger) were classified in group IV 
(seeming to have but little or no basis) . 

There were more vegetable preparation rules classified 
in group IV than classified in the other four groups com- 
bined. The most frequent type of vegetable preparation 
rule classed in group IV was a rule concerning preparation 
of new vegetables, especially new potatoes, which supposed- 
ly were unhealthful unless prepared in a particular manner. 
Negro homemakers also gave a number of vegetable prepa- 
ration rules classified in group III. Many of these rules 
pertained to addition of soda to vegetables to make tender. 
White women gave relatively more vegetable preparation 
rules in accord with practices now recommended by special- 
ists and more rules in accord with directions found in old 
cookbooks examined but now outdated. More of the "scien- 
tific" vegetable preparation rules and the outdated vege- 
table preparation rules concerned nutrition recommenda- 
tions or were outdated because of increased knowledge of 
nutrition, than concerned technical recommendations or 
were outdated because of development of better technical 
methods or changes in processing. About 20 percent of 
the vegetable rules reported by white women and 80 percent 
by Negro women included a reason with the rule. In both 
Negro and white groups when a rule contained a reason, 
this reason was most frequently: (1) To tender or cook 
quicker; (2) to make more healthful, i. e., to keep from 
making sick, to get rid of poison, let sap out; (3) to im- 



58 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

prove flavor. Flavor was given more relative importance 
by whites ; to tender or cook quicker by Negroes.*^ 

Relatively more of the meat, poultry, and fish prepara- 
tion rules were classified in group 11. The most common 
rule in this group reported by white women was a rule 
concerning searing meat to hold in the juices, while Negro 
women more often gave a rule concerning use of vinegar 
to tender meat. More of the ''scientific" meat preparation 
rules and the outdated meat preparation rules concerned 
technical recommendations or were outdated because of de- 
velopment of better technical methods or changes in 
processing than concerned nutritional recommendations or 
were outdated because of increased knowledge in nutri- 
tion. To tender was the reason most often accompanying 
meat rules reported by both white and Negro women, al- 
though Negroes mentioned to tender about two times as 
often as whites. 

More cake preparation rules were classified in group 
IV, while more bread preparation rules were classified in 
group I. ''Scientific" rules concerning preparation of cake 
and bread were technical recommendations. Outdated cake 
and bread rules were outdated because of development of 
better technical methods rather than increased nutrition 
information. 

Among the types of transfer that seem to have oc- 
curred in connection with passing down food preparation in- 
formation were: (1) Transfer of qualities of soda to sugar, 
or vice versa (soda makes tender, therefore, sugar will 
make tender ; sugar makes taste better, therefore, soda will 
make taste better). (2) Transfer from vegetable to meat 
practices (soda makes vegetable tender, then will make 
meat tender). (3) Transfer from meat to vegetable prac- 
tices (vinegar makes meat tender, then will make vege- 
tables tender) . (4) Transfer from one vegetable to another 

48In commenting on the manuscript Dr. Margaret Mead mentioned the absence 
of the folk idea of "goodness" important in English and American cooking. Ac- 
cording to her, there is a belief that there is especial essence of the food called 
"goodness" which lives in the skin or under the skin which will be lost by too 
much cooking, gets thrown away in the cooking water. The idea, she states, takes 
this sort of form : "All the goodness of the meat goea into the broth, that's why 
we give broth to the sick," "the goodness of a potato is just inside the skin," 
"if you peel an apple you lose most of its goodness." 



TRADITIONAL FOOD PREPARATION RULES

or to all vegetables : (a) If one starts vegetables that grow 
under ground in cold water, then one starts potatoes in 
cold water, then one starts starches in cold water; (b) If 
parboiling is good for strong vegetables, then it is good for 
other vegetables; (c) If parboiling is good for new vege- 
tables, then it is good for old vegetables; (d) If string 
beans boiled 3 hours taste good, then why not boil turnip 
greens 3 hours? (5) Transfer from one meat to another 
or to all meats: (a) Vinegar is good for tough meats; 
therefore, good for all meats ; (b) If a little vinegar makes 
meat tender, it will also make chicken tender; (6) Degenera- 
tion of a reality practice, as from cooking meat on skewers 
over coals to use of nails in meat cooked on stove. 

Significance of Traditional Food Preparation Rules for 
Home Economists 

To what extent homemakers of this study still follow- 
ed food preparation rules taught by mother or someone 
else in parental home will be shown in a future report. Even 
though many no longer followed the rules, an analysis such 
as this has significance for home economists, for it shows: 

(1) That older homemakers and homemakers with less 
schooling, such as Negro homemakers, have more often been 
taught food preparation rules by their mothers or someone 
else at home. It would, therefore, seem especially important 
in working with such groups to learn every thing possible 
about what the women have been taught and to use this 
information as a basis for a teaching program. For in- 
stance, if it is found that soda is used for tendering vege- 
tables by a number of women in the group, a lesson in 
vegetable cookery might be started off in the following 
manner: *'I know folks always used to say add a little soda 
to vegetable to tender . . . 

(2) Need for examination of all old cookbooks in the 
area in which group with whom one works resides. (Cook- 
books, it must be remembered, are a way of preserving 
outmoded practices — practices that are actually contrary to 
modern teaching.) It might be well to establish a museum 



60 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 418 

of old cookbooks in each county publicizing the fact that 
these books are relics of the past. 

(3) Need for presenting food preparation as a chang- 
ing body of information. It changes because of: (a) in- 
creased nutrition information; (b) development of new 
techniques in preparation; (c) changes in processing; (d) 
changes in taste brought about by the introduction of new 
foods, new dishes, new ideas from other areas. 

(4) That even in the case of "scientific" food prepara- 
tion rules, an attempt is made to commend the practice 
from a practical basis. This shows the importance of giv- 
ing practical reasons for every step in preparation. 

(5) That source of "unscientific" food preparation prac- 
tices prevalent in the area in which one is working should 
be sought and discussed with the group before attempting 
to change practices. 

(6) That since most women who are taught food prepa- 
ration in turn teach others, techniques in passing on food 
preparation information are most important in order that 
directions may not be misinterpreted or misapplied. 

(7) Importance of teaching discrimination in choice of 
food preparation information. 

(8) This study suggests that at the beginning of train- 
ing in vegetable preparation or meat preparation, it might 
be well to have students write essays on "What I Have 
Been Taught at Home About Cooking Vegetables" or "What 
I Have Been Taught at Home About Cooking Meats." Such 
material would serve as an excellent background for teach- 
ing food courses.

INTRODUCTION 



Livestock production has increased to a very marked 
degree in Mississippi during recent years. This increased 
production trend was most noticeable soon after controlled 
cotton acreage began in 1933, and is attributed to an at- 
tempt by the farmers to offset the decreased acreage and 
income from cotton. This trend has increased, however, 
during the past few years probably because of more favor- 
able prices of livestock products. In addition, the scarcity 
of farm labor has caused farmers to divert more land to the 
growing of livestock and dairy animals in order to utilize 
the maximum of their farm land. 

Thus, with a considerable increase in production of live- 
stock and dairy animals, there has likewise been an in- 
creased demand for feed. Since it is generally agreed 
that pastures afford some of the cheapest feed to be had, 
increased livestock production has resulted in an increas- 
ed demand for pastures, both for increased acreage and 
for better grazing on pastures already established. 

The program of pasture improvement and establish- 
ment of new pastures has been accelerated by the fact that 
the Agricultural Adjustment Administration has extend- 
ed certain payments for pasture practices such as clear- 
ing, seeding, fertilizing, terracing, and mowing; and the 
acreage on which the payments could be made has been 
unlimited. 

As a result of this increased production of livestock to- 
gether with the increased demand for pasture improve- 
ment practices, there has been a great demand for in- 
formation from workers in the various agricultural agen- 
cies which might be used in teaching farmers and farm 
boys the probable value of each pasture improvement prac- 
tice and the extent to which it would be economical to 
use the practices. 

An attempt is made in this bulletin to bring together all 
the data, especially experimental data, available on pas- 
ture practices that seem to be applicable to Mississippi 
conditions. Since the amount and variety of such data are 



very limited it was thought that it would be advisable to 
supplement these data with information on improved pas- 
ture practices being used by farmers in the various sec- 
tions of Mississippi. 

Thus, a survey was made on 86 farms in 4 areas of 
Mississippi; namely, (1) South Mississippi, (2) North- 
east Mississippi, (3) the Brown Loam Area, and (4) the 
Prairie Area. Farmers' reaction as to the value of im- 
proved pasture practices was obtained, definite observa- 
tions were made, and in this way some very definite indi- 
cations were obtained as to the probable value of the various 
pasture improvement practices. It is thought that this 
type of information on farmers' practices will supplement 
the experimental data in a very helpful way. 

A summary of these surveys is shown and discussed in 
detail by areas and as a whole in Part II of this bulletin. 
The survey study is also referred to and discussed in part 
in other sections of this bulletin. 

It is hoped that this information will be useful to agri- 
cultural workers and, in turn, to farmers of Mississippi, 
as a guide in helping them to decide the probable value 
of the various pasture improvement practices and extent 
to which it might be most economical to use each practice 
on individual farms. 



Improving Pastures In 
Mississippi 

PART I 

THE VALUE OF PASTURES IN LIVESTOCK 
PRODUCTION* 

The lowering of the cost of production and the efficiency 
of production are as important in agriculture as in any other 
type of industry. In this economic sense, the efficient 
production of livestock and livestock products is directly 
related to the production of pastures. 

That pasture production plays an extremely important 
part in the agriculture of Mississippi is shown by the 
practical results obtained by various departments of the 
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station. 

The Dairy Department at Mississippi State College has 
conducted many tests which show that no other method 
of providing feed for livestock offers as great returns as 
the use of good pastures. Pasture made on eroded land 
was found to furnish nutrients per cow per day, equivalent 
to those found in 8.5 pounds of good hay, 25 pounds of 
silage, and 4 pounds of concentrates. Other results ob- 
tained by the Dairy Department show that a good pasture 
alone will provide for animal maintenance and the pro- 
duction of at least 15 pounds of 4 percent milk per cow 
per day. The matter of maintenance is quite important 
as a milking dairy cow requires nearly half the nutrients 
in the feed she consumes merely for maintaining her body. 
The experimental test below shows the value of good pas- 
ture for dairy cattle at State College, Mississippi, from 
1924 to 1926.

Value of Pasture for Dairy Cows 

Conducted by: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: State College, Mississippi. 
Period: 1924-1926. 

Purpose: To compare the production of milk cows with 
and without pastures. 

Procedure and conditions: During the summer of 1924, 
five cows on good pasture were compared with five cows on 
poor pasture for a period of 168 days. This test was re- 
peated in 1925 with two lots of four cows each for a period 
of 161 days. The average results of these 2 years prelimi- 
nary work indicate that a cow on good pasture can secure 
sufficient feed for maintenance and for the daily production 
of 14 pounds of milk testing 4 percent butterfat. In 1926, 
a test was made by dividing 12 cows into 3 lots of 4 cows 
each. The cows were fed for three periods of 8 weeks each 
as follows : Lot 1 was on good pasture during the first and 
third periods and in a dry lot during the second period. Lot 
2 was in a dry lot during periods one and three and on good 
pasture during period two. Lot 3 was on good pasture for 
all three periods. One week was allowed between each 
period for making the change from one feed to another. 
The results of these tests are shown in table 1.

Value of Pastures for Livestock, Poultry and 
Erosion Control* 

The Animal Husbandary Department, in an experiment 
comparing methods of feeding mules, has found, when 
mules were allowed to graze only at night and on idle days, 
that there was a saving of 25 percent in grain and a 50 
percent saving in hay consumed, as compared with the 
barn and lot-fed mules. These results take on considerable 
value when one' considers that a properly fed, 1,000-pound 
mule will consume 2 tons of hay and 60 bushels of corn 
per year. 

Other experiments carried on by the Animal Husbandry 
Department have shown something as to the value of 
pastures. More pork has been produced per 100 pounds of 
feed where grain-fed pigs were allowed to graze than when 
fed on dry lot. It has also been shown that more cotton- 
seed meal, a home-grown concentrate, can be fed to grazing 
pigs than to pen-fed pigs. 

The Poultry Department has found that more eggs are 
produced, there is less mortality in the flock, and the ef- 
ficiency of production is increased when poultry is allowed 
pasturage. 

The value of a pasture is almost inestimable when viewed 
from a soil conservation standpoint. The Agricultural En- 
gineering Department of the Mississippi Station in co- 
operation with the U. S. Soil Conservation Service con- 
ducts experiments testing the rate of soil losses under 
different slopes and cropping practice^^. A typical example 
of the results obtained from these tests may be cited. 
As a result of 24 inches of rain over a period of 3 months, 
the amount of soil lost from a 9 percent slope covered with 
sod was only 0.08 tons per acre, while a crop-cultivated 
7.5 percent slope lost approximately 5 tons of soil per acre 
during the same period and with the same amount of 
rainfall. This gives a value to pastures which amounts to 
huge proportions when one considers the average rainfall 
and the topography of many of the Mississippi pastures. 

These examples are given. to cite the value of pastures,

\n Mississippi," page 4, State College, Mississippi, July 1941. 



10 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

not only from a general farming standpoint and for the 
economcial production of livestock and livestock products, 
but also as a means of stabilizing and utilizing the many 
eroded and erosive acres of Mississippi soil thus enabling 
the realization of more income and food products than 
formerly. These examples show, further, that the general- 
crops farmer, as well as the livestock farmer, needs good 
pasture for his milk cows, beef cattle, hogs, poultry, and 
for his work stock. 

PART II 

IMPROVED PASTURES 

One has but to travel the highways in Mississippi to know 
that pastures, generally, need improvement. In a large 
percentage of these pastures can be seen weeds, briars, 
bushes, and other undesirable plants which greatly hinder 
the growth of desirable pasture plants. 

Farmer practices have shown that such pastures can be 
improved even where the only practices used were clear- 
ing the land of bushes, weeds, etc., and controlling same by 
mowing regularly. For instance, on the farm of Marshall 
Rivers at Union, Mississippi, in Neshoba County, a 14-acre 
pasture was cleared of such growth and mowed twice a year 
for 2 years, and the carrying capacity was increased from 8 
animal units to 18, according to statements of the owner. 
Results of other practices might be cited on C. C. Harveys' 
farm, Winona, Mississippi, in Montgomery County. This 
65-acre pasture was carrying 30 animal units without any 
special improvement practices. An application of 1,000 pounds 
of lime and 500 pounds of basic slag per acre was made. 
Dallis grass, white Dutch clover, and lespedeza were sown 
and the pasture was mowed twice a year. About 2 years 
later it was carrying 65 animal units. These results were 
obtained on bottomland which was better than average in 
fertility before it was fertilized.* 

Special Study of Pasture Improvement Practices 

In order to better determine what can be done in the way 
of improving pastures in Mississippi under everyday farm

11 



conditions, a survey of pasture conditions, improvement 
practices used, and practical results obtained, was made on 
86 Mississippi farms. 

These surveys were made in four general soil areas of 
Mississippi, namely. South Mississippi, Northeast Missis- 
sippi, Brown Loam, and Prairie. The number of farm sur- 
veys made in each area varied somewhat according to the 
number of farms in the area and the amount of experi- 
mental data available for the area. 

No attempt was made to select the best nor the poorest 
farms surveyed, but some of all types were selected with 
the idea of securing a fair cross-sectional sampling for 
each area; however, in spite of this, some of the better 
farms were probably surveyed because farmers were se- 
lected that had done one or more pasture improvement 
practices and it is natural to assume that farmers who are 
interested to the extent that they had done some improve- 
ment practices might have been in the better farming 
group. Too, the farmers surveyed may have better soil 
than the average farmer, and did have, in most cases, 
special technical help and guidance in carrying out the 
practices. It is believed, however, that the improved prac- 
tices used by these farmers will indicate possible improve- 
ments to almost all farmers. For the stated reasons, how- 
ever, all farmers should not necessarily expect to secure 
the same results by use of the same practices as are shown 
in this study. 

The survey ascertained all the practices done during the 
past 5 years as well as the pasture conditions before treat- 
ment and at the present, and the approximate results ob- 
tained as a result of pasture treatments. An analysis and 
discussion of this study by soil areas and for all the areas 
as a whole, follows. 

South Mississippi Area 

Thirty-two farms were surveyed in seven different coun- 
ties in this area. The pastures varied in size from 12 
to 1,120 acres. 

A summary of the surveys from this area is shown in 
table 2; however, all the conditions, practices, and results 



12 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

are not shown in the summary because some of these 
were rather indefinite and could not be recorded in actual 
figures.

As shown in table 2 the average size of the pasture was 
about 102 acres, 44 of which were hill land, 50.7 bottom- 
land, and 7.4 terrace land. 

On the average 3.8 acres of pasture land was required 
to carry an animal unit before pasture treatments were 
made and only 1.6 acres were required after treatments. 
This is an increase in carrying capacity of approximately 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



13 



140 percent. In other words, the average pasture which 
was 102 acres in size carried about 30 animal units before 
treatment and 64 after treatment. This obviously is a 
good increase in carrying capacity of pastures due to im- 
provement practices ; however, the carrying capacity of 
these pastures was comparatively high before treatments 
were given. For instance, where 3.8 acres were required 
to carry an animal unit in the South Mississippi Area, 
4.6 acres were required in the Brown Loam Area which 
is generally considered better adapted to pastures. This 
might be partially explained by the fact that about half 
of the pasture land surveyed in South Mississippi was 
bottomland and the hill land had only a 4.5 percent slope on 
the average; whereas, only 23 percent of the land in the 
Brown Loam Area was bottom soil and the average slope 
of hill land was 8.8 percent, all of which indicates that in 
South Mississippi, on the farms studied, soils well adapted 
to pastures were devoted to pastures. The response to 
treatment, however, seemed to be better in the Brown 
Loam Area, in that the number of acres required to carry 
an animal unit after treatments in both areas was very 
nearly the same. 

Practices used in securing this increase in carrying 
capacity in South Mississippi are as follows: Approxi- 
mately three-fourth of the land was limed and about half 
of the land had an application of phosphate but only a small 
percentage had basic slag. The rate of applying lime and 
basic slag was comparatively high while the rate for 
phosphate was low. About half of the pasture land was 
seeded to white Dutch clover, lespedeza, and Dallis grass. 
Twenty-four of the 32 farmers mowed their pastures, about 
82 percent of the average pasture being mowed an aver- 
age of 1.5 times per year. 

The increased carrying capacity, which, as stated above 
was from an average of 30 to 64 animal units, is thought 
not a true indication of the increased value of the pasture, 
for several reasons. First, when farmers made one or 
more pasture improvements, many of them would im- 
mediately increase the size of their livestock and/or dairy 
herds, which in a number of cases resulted in over-grazing 
and low gains as well as poor quality products. On the 



14 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

other hand, some farmers were not over-grazing before 
treatments were given, and after treatments their pastures 
would have carried more animals than were carried; while 
some farmers were over-grazing before any pasture im- 
provements were made and with the same number of ani- 
mals following improvements, the animals were carried 
adequately. It might be noted here, that according to 
observation and experience of agricultural workers con- 
tacted in this study, over-grazing hinders the establish- 
ment of new grasses and eradicates more grasses and 
clovers already established in pastures than any other 
undesirable practice. 

No definite part or value of the increased carrying 
capacity of these pasture practices can be assigned to 
any particular practice used because in most cases two 
or more practices were done at the same time with no 
attempt to determine the value of each one separately. 
However, it is evident that all the practices together were 
of definite value. The farmers' reaction, as well as that 
of the agricultural workers who assisted the farmers, was 
that the use of the mowing machine gave quicker and 
greater returns, especially when considered in the light 
of costs, than any other pasture improvement practice; 
and the use of fertilizer was probably second in value. 

Statements made in the two preceding paragraphs apply 
equally to the other soil areas discussed in this section 
and will not be repeated in the discussions for each area. 

It should be pointed out that every farmer in South 
Mississippi should not necessarily expect the same re- 
sults from pasture improvement practices as shown here, 
even with the same treatments. One reason for this is 
that, as already indicated, the pasture land included in the 
surveys for this area was comparatively good land and 
probably better than the average in South Mississippi. 
Many other conditions and factors vary from farm to 
farm. Yet, these results do indicate that improved prac- 
tices adapted to each individual would result in better pas- 
tures in every case. Thus, it is suggested here that each 
farmer estimate the cost and value of treatments for his 
individual farm, taking into consideration his conditions. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



15 



situations, etc. These estimates may be somewhat on the 
basis of the summary shown in table 2. It would be easy 
to calculate the cost of the practices shown in this table 
which would apply to any farm in the South Mississippi 
Area if the same practices were anticipated; however, 
the returns expected would probably vary and could easily 
be less than shown here for reasons already given. The 
form shown in table 15 might be of value in helping in- 
dividual farmers estimate the cost of pasture practices, 
returns expected, and in trying to determine the practices 
and the extent of each practice to be used. 

Northeast Mississippi Area 

Twenty farms were surveyed in four different counties 
in this area. The size of the pastures varied from 6 to 
72 acres, the average being 32.3 acres. A summary of 
these surveys is shown in table 3. 

As shown by figures in the table, 2.5 acres were re- 
quired to carry an animal unit before the above treatments 
were given the pastures and only 1.4 acres after these 
treatments were given. Thus, the average pasture of 32.3 
acres in this area carried almost 13 animal units before 
treatment and about 23 head after treatments were made. 
The percentage increase in carrying capacity here is not 
so great, comparatively speaking; however, the carrying 
capacity of the pastures was high before any treatments 
were made. This is probably due to the fact that the 
pasture land in this area, on the average, was fairly high 
in fertility, a probability borne out by the fact that only 
about 30 percent of the pasture land in this area was up- 
land. Since a high percentage of the pasture land was 
in the bottom, it is reasonable to suppose that it was better 
than average land, and thus the chances for increased 
production due to use of improvement practices were 
less than if the land had been less fertile. Another factor 
indicates that even the better hill soils were in pasture, 
in that the average slope of the hill land was only 4.2 per- 
cent. It might be pointed out here that the carrying 
capacity of pastures before any treatments were given was 
higher in this area than in any other studied. Thus, 
in the light of the high carrying capacity of these pastures 



16 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

before any treatments were given, the increase due to pas- 
ture treatments was favorable. 

Summarizing the practices used in securing these im- 
provements it should be noted: (1) A high percentage of 
the land had an application of phosphate and basic slag and 
the rate was in line with generally accepted practices. 
(2) About one-third of the land was limed, although the 
rate of application was comparatively low. (3) About half 
of the land was seeded to white Dutch clover, lespedeza, 
and Dallis grass. (4) Eighteen of the 20 farmers mowed

their pasture twice a year, and approximately 90 percent 
of the pasture land was mowed. (5) Thirteen farmers 
practiced rotational grazing. The treatments given were 
in line with what has been considered generally as accepted 
practices. In fact, the percentage of land phosphated and 
the rate of application was unusually high. Noxious weeds 
were well controlled and the pastures w^ere exceptionally 
good. 

Every farmer in Northeast Mississippi should not expect 
the same results from pasture improvement practices as 
are shown in this summary because about half of the sur- 
veys made in this area were made in Lee County, and the 
soil in this county, on the average, is probably more fertile 
than in some other counties in this area. Too, the farmers 
in this county are more intensively engaged in dairying 
than in most of the other counties in Northeast Mississippi 
which probably has increased the incentive for building 
better pastures. However, the figures in this study indi- 
cate that most any farmer might expect favorable results, 
on the average, by use of good pasture practices, but it is 
suggested here that each individual farmer estimate as 
closely as possible the cost of anticipated practices and the 
probable returns. Figures shown in table 3 and the sug- 
gested form in table 15 should be helpful to farmers in 
making these estimates. 

Brown Loam Area 

Twenty-three farms were surveyed in four different 
counties in this area. The size of the pastures varied from 
17 to 900 acres, the average being 131 acres. A summary 
of these surveys is shown in table 4. 

According to the table 4.3 acres of pasture land was re- 
quired to carry an animal unit before any pasture treat- 
ments were made and only 1.6 acres were required after 
treatments were made. Therefore, the average pasture 
in this area, which was 131 acres in size, carried about 
30 animal units before pasture treatments were given 
and about 80 head after treatments. These figures show 
an unusually good increase in carrying capacity which was 
presumably a result of pasture treatments shown in this 



18 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

survey. However, the acreage required to carry an animal 
unit before treatments was higher than in any of the 
other areas. This is probably due, principally, to the fact 
that only 25 percent of the pasture land was bottomland 
compared to about 50 percent in South Mississippi, 40 per- 
cent in Northeast Mississippi, and 20 percent in the Prairie 
Area. In addition, the slope of the hill land in this area 
was 8.8 percent, which was much higher than in any 
other area. At the same time, the carrying capacity after 
pasture treatments were made was comparatively high.

The exceptional increase in carrying capacity of the pas- 
tures in the Brown Loam Area was probably due, in the 
main, to the fact that practically all the land had either 
an application of phosphate and lime or basic slag, and 
the rate of application was as high or higher than recom- 
mended by pasture specialists. It might be noted here that 
the rate of applying phosphate and lime was higher in this 
area than either of the other three areas studied. An- 
other probable effective factor in the marked improvement 
of these pastures was that practically every farmer mowed 
his pasture twice each year to control undesirable plants. 
Other treatments which contributed to some extent were 
that more than half of the farmers practiced rotational 
grazing, about half of the land was seeded with plants 
generally recommended for this area, and seedings were 
made, at recommended rates. 

Since the percentage of improvement was greater in 
the Brown Loam Area than in any other area in spite of 
the fact that, as shown above, a larger part of the pas- 
tures was hill land and of steeper slope, the survey data 
seem to indicate that Brown Loam soils are particularly 
adapted to pasture plants and that they respond well to 
good pasture practices. 

It should be pointed out here, also, that every farmer 
in the Brown Loam Area should not expect the same 
results as shown in table 4, even if they use the same 
practices. On the other hand, it would be better for each 
farmer to calculate the cost of each practice which might 
be done on the basis of figures shown in table 4. Of 
course, the returns could be estimated on the basis of the 
figures shown in the same table; however, it would be 
best for each farmer to estimate the returns as well as the 
cost on his particular farm. The form suggested in table 
15 of this bulletin might be used in calculating and estimat- 
ing costs and returns of pasture improvement practices. 

Prairie Area 

Only eleven farms were surveyed in this area, which was 
fewer than in any of the other areas. The size of the 
pastures varied from 2 to 145 acres, or an average of 55.7 
acres. A summary of these surveys is shown in table 5.

According to the table, 2.4 acres was required to 
carry an animal unit before pasture treatments were made, 
whereas 1.7 acres were required after treatments were 
made. For the average farm surveyed in this study, this 
means that the average pasture of 55.7 acres carried 
about 23 animal units before treatments and 33 animal 
units after treatments, or an increase of about 43 percent 
in carrying capacity. This increase in carrying capacity 
is smaller than in any of the other areas although it is 
about the same as the increase in Northeast Mississippi. 
There are probably several reasons why this increase is 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



21 



comparatively small. First, the land devoted to pasture 
seems to be some of the better land on the farms. As 
shown in table 5, only 11 acres or about 20 percent of the 
land was bottomland; and even though the remaining 80 
percent was hill land, it only had about a 3.2 percent slope 
which indicates that this land was some of the better 
hill land on the farms. This is further borne out by the 
high carrying capacity of the land before treatment. An- 
other factor which is not shown in the summary is that,, 
from observations and contacts with agricultural leaders 
in these areas, the pastures were not over-grazed as much 
in the Prairie Area as in some areas. Thus, these pastures 
might have supported more animal units and still not 
have been over-grazed. 

It is interesting to note the practices used in securing 
the above results. Phosphate and basic slag were applied 
on a very high percentage of the land and the rate of 
application was also high. White Dutch clover, lespedeza, 
and yellow hop clover was sown on over half of the land 
and the rate of seeding was comparatively heavy. Also, 
from observation made, undesirable plants were apparently 
well controlled, and the figures in table 5 show that 9 of 
the 11 farmers mowed 90 percent of the land an average 
of 1.7 times per year. 

It seems to be the consensus among farmers and agri- 
cultural leaders in this area that fertilizer is very im- 
portant to the production of good pastures, especially 
phosphate, and on some soils, lime and potash are giving 
good results also. It is also their reaction that the mowing 
machine for the control of undesirable weeds is very profit- 
able but that seeding is not as necessary, especially on the 
black lands. The prairie soils seem to be particularly 
adapted to the growing of desirable pasture plants. Many of 
the desirable plants are already well distributed, if other 
conditions are made favorable they come in naturally in 
a short time. 

Every farmer in the Prairie Area would not be justified 
in expecting the same results by use of the practices shown 
in table 5. As mentioned before in this bulletin, so 
many factors vary from farm to farm such as fertility 



22 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

of soil, type of soil, etc., that the percentage increase might 
be even more or less than is shown here. Nevertheless, it 
is suggested here that each farmer estimate the cost of 
pasture practices anticipated and probable returns which 
may be done somewhat on the basis of figures shown 
in the table above. A suggested form for making these 
estimates is shown in table 15.

These figures may not be significant since the soil type, 
fertihty, and other conditions vary widely in the different 
soil areas studied. On the other hand, farmers might be 
interested in comparing all of these factors along with 
pasture treatments and results obtained in their par- 
ticular area to those for the four areas combined. 

The above table shows that the average size of pasture 
on the 86 farms studied was 88.8 acres ; and that 3.7 acres 
were required to carry one animal unit before improve- 
ment practices were used, whereas, after treatments only 
1.6 acres were required. In other words, the average farm 
carried 24 animal units on 88.8 acres before treatments 
and about 55 after treatments, which is an increase of 
approximately 130 percent. This is an exceptionally high 
increase in carrying capacity by the use of pasture im- 
provement practices and it is improbable that such favor- 
able results could be obtained on every farm. Yet these 
results do indicate improved practices adapted to each 
individual farm. 

It is interesting to examine the practices used in bring- 
ing about these exceptional results as well as the conditions 
that may be contributive to same. First, the soil type was 
probably an important factor in that only about 42 per- 
cent of the land was terrace (second bottom) and bot- 
tomland which means that approximately 58 percent of 
the land was upland. Since upland soils, on the average, 
are less fertile than bottom and second bottom soils, the 
chances for improved production due to the use of fertilizers 
were much greater. Even though the study shows that 
the percentage improvement as a result of improvement 
practices was greater on upland or thinner soils, the best 
pastures were found on the better or more fertile soils. 
This was true before improvement practices were used as 
well as after they were used. Over 60 percent of the land 
was treated with lime and phosphorus and about 30 percent 
was treated with basic slag. The rate of application for the 
three elements was about the amount that has been recom- 
mended generally by pasture specialists in the past. About 
half of the land was seeded to white Dutch clover, lespedeza 
and Dallis grass, while less than 20 percent was seeded to 
yellow hop clover. In addition, about 88 percent of the 



2 4 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

pasture land was mowed an average of 1.8 times per 
year, and 47 of the 86 farmers practiced rotational graz- 
ing. It can be seen from the figures on fertilizer practices 
in table 6 or from figures just quoted above, that, in 
reality, practically all the land surveyed had had one or 
more applications of some kind of fertilizer. Usually where 
basic slag was applied, no lime or phosphorus was used 
unless applied the following or in subsequent years. On 
the other hand, if lime and phosphorus were applied, and 
they usually were applied together, basic slag was not used 
on the same land the same year. Therefore, since it is 
shown that about 60 percent of the land was treated with 
lime and phosphorus and 30 percent with basic slag, this 
would indicate that about 90 percent of the land had 
phosphorus and lime applied in one form or another; how- 
ever, this is not literally true because in a few cases lime 
and phosphorus was applied one year and in subsequent 
years basic slag was applied on the same land and vice 
versa. 

In summarizing, it would possibly be safe to say that 
75 to 80 percent of the land was fertilized and almost half 
of it was seeded to a regular pasture mixture. Almost 
90 percent of the land was mowed about twice a year. All 
in all, the practices used by the 86 farmers surveyed seem 
to be well in line with what have been considered good 
pasture practices, and apparently they were effective from 
the results secured insofar as the results can be measured 
from figures shown. It has already been mentioned in 
this bulletin that the increase in carrying capacity shown 
in this study does not mean that the pastures increased in 
value to the same extent because the values of the pas- 
tures in terms of gains or production before treatments 
as well as after treatments are not known. Thus, the re- 
sults here are more or less approximate and indicative 
but it can safely be said that there was a pronounced im- 
provement in the pastures as a result of these pasture 
improvement practices.

Pasture Improved by Fertilizing and Seeding 

The 2-acre pasture shown in the picture below belongs 
to Vivian Carter, Louisville, Mississippi. 

This pasture had 5 tons of lime and 1 ton of 4-8-8 ap- 
plied to it in the spring of 1940 and was seeded with white 
Dutch clover, yellow hop clover, lespedeza, and Dallis grass. 

During the grazing season of 1941, an average of five 
to six head of livestock was carried on each acre of this 
pasture.

Experimental Results on Pasture Improvement 
Practices 

Tests from various agricultural experiment stations com- 
paring the value of improved to unimproved pastures are 
shown here. This information is unlike the survey study 
above, in that the results are measured in pounds of prod- 
ucts produced and the tests were run mostly in other 
states. However, they are similar to the survey in that 
no certain value can be assigned to any particular pasture 
practice. All the improvement practices needed, in most 
cases, were used at the same time.

Permanent Pastures for Dairy Cattle 

Conducted by: Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: S. B. Hartsell farm, Claiborne Parish; N. 
E. Moncrief farm, Lincoln Parish ; B. E. Alford farm, Wash- 
ington Parish. 

Period: 1937-1940. 

Purpose: To show what the added returns would be from 
improved over unimproved permanent pastures on Louisi- 
ana dairy farms, and was not a test to determine the actual 
fertilizer treatment necessary for best results. 

Soil: Claiborne Parish — Norfolk sandy loam. 

Lincoln Parish — Ruston very fine sandy loam. 

Washington Parish — Cahaba sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: Each test pasture was divided 
into halves, and each half was treated alike except that one 
received fertilizer and the other did not. The fertilized 
half received a complete fertilizer (4-12-4) at the rate of 
350 pounds per acre during October or early November 
of each year. In addition, 50 pounds of nitrate of soda per 
acre were applied during May of each year. The amount 
and kind of fertilizer used was not considered the very 
best for each particular pasture. There was evidence, how- 
ever, that each test area had soils deficient in both phos- 
phorus and nitrogen, and possibly potash. Also, previous 
work in the State had shown that best results were secured 
when all three major plant food elements were applied at 
the approximate rate used in this test. Two of the three 
test areas received applications of limestone to correct 
the soil acidity. Details regarding the amounts used as 
well as the time applied will be given under the discussion 
of individual tests. 

Test pastures, including those not fertilized, were seeded 
to clovers and Dallis grass. The clovers included white 
Dutch, hop, and bur. Annual fall seedings of either oats 
or rye grass were made for 2 years on one test and for 
3 years on another. Weeds were controlled by two or more 
mowings each year. Producing Jersey cows grazed each 
test pasture and were rotated between pasture areas in 
order to graze the fertilized and unfertilized halves to the 
same degree of closeness. 

A good idea of the benefits obtained from improving 
permanent pastures can be derived from the 4-year aver- 
age results secured from the three tests located in widely

results and to determine the effect fertilization had on the 
mineral content of the herbage.

In the fall of 1940, basic slag was applied at the rate of 
600 pounds per acre to the previously unfertilized half of 
each test pasture. The halves receiving the annual applica- 
tion of 4-12-4 and nitrate of soda were treated the same as 
in the past, with the exception of one test (Hartsell), in 
which case no fertilizer was applied. 

The added response from the previously unfertilized 
halves as compared to the 4-year averages for the test pas-

Period: 1941. 

Purpose: To compare the results with beef breeding cat-

Soil: Cecil. 

Procedure and conditions: Test I — Improvement of sev- 
eral pastures in 1936 consisted of applying limestone and 
fertilizers and seeding pasture legumes on bermuda sod. 
After several years of excellent and increasing production 
of the improved pastures, the stand of clovers (white

was not sufficient treatment to bring back the more de- 
sirable clovers, but a seeding of Ladino clover in the fall of 
1941, along with somewhat favorable weather conditions, 
is once more bringing the improved pastures into their 
former high state of productiveness. In contrast to the

improved pastures, the unimproved pastures declined most 
in productiveness in the first few years of this experiment. 
Steers were used to graze some of these pastures the first 
several years but breeding cows and calves have been 
the experimental animals on these pastures from 1939 
until the present. Results obtained on these pastures in 
1941 are given in table 11. 

Test II — In pasture No. 1, 3 acres out of the 10 received 
a lespedeza seeding instead of clover, and received only 
half as much phosphate as the remaining 7 acres of clover 
in order to discourage clovers from coming into the lespe- 
deza. In pasture No. 2 all 10 acres were seeded to clover, 
and the only lespedeza present is that which survived 
the winter clover competition. 

Fertilizer was applied as follows: Limestone at the rate 
of 1,580 pounds ; 600 pounds 16 percent phosphate on clovers 
and 300 pounds on lespedeza and 400 pounds soda per acre. 

Some grazing was obtained on all pastures during the 
winter months, November through January. Results of 
Test II are shown in table 12. 

In the second year of this experiment (1941) much better 
cattle gains were obtained than in 1940, especially on the 
improved pastures and more so on the bottomland than on 
upland areas. This is typical of pasture improvement ef- 
fects because as the clover stand and growth improve, 
the grass sod is thickened up and the amount of grass

growth is also increased, both factors thus being instru- 
mental in increasing cattle gains. 

The outstanding difference shown by table 12 is the 
much greater cattle gains obtained on the bottomland (242 
pounds per acre) as compared to upland pastures (average 
123 pounds per acre). The greater cattle gains were pro- 
duced on bottomland both because of the higher carrying 
capacity and longer grazing season. These two factors 
are combined in ''steer-days of grazing" per acre, which 
amounted to 199 on bottomland pastures (average of 4) 
and 113 on the upland pastures (average of 5). Pasture 
No. 6, which is part upland and part bottomland, produced 
210 pounds of steer gains and provided 170 steer-days of 
grazing, thus placing this pasture between strictly upland 
and strictly bottomland in productiveness. This indicates 
that under normal farm conditions considerable increased 
cattle production can be obtained if some bottomland is 
combined with upland pasture. 

In addition to greater cattle gains on bottomlands than 
on uplands, more crimson and white Dutch clover seed 
were harvested on the bottomland and there was sufficient 
excess growth from grass in the summer that hay and 
grass for silage was also obtained on bottomland pasture. 
The exact amounts of seed saved and hay and silage ob- 
tained on the pastures are not given in the reference used ; 
however, the values are given but are not shown in table 
12. However, crimson clover seed were valued at 6 cents, 
white clover seed at 75 cents per pound, and hay and grass 
silage at $10 per ton, and on these price assumptions the 
value of clover seed, hay and silage obtained on bottomland 
pastures was as great or slightly greater than the value 
of steer gains produced on most of the upland pastures, 
valuing beef at Sy^ cents per pound.

Improved Versus Native Pasture 

Conducted by: Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 
College Station. 

Conducted at: Angleton, Texas. 

Period: 1934-37. 

Purpose: To compare native and improved pasture for 
fattening steers. 

Land history: The area was natural prairie land which 
had been a native hay meadow for a number of years 



32 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

previous to being plowed and seeded to improved pasture 
grasses. 

Soil: The soil was Lake Charles clay loam and Edna 
very fine sandy loam with salt spots. The land was almost 
level, with fair, but slow drainage, and was not eroded. 

Procedure and conditions: The improved pasture con- 
sisted of about an equal mixture of dallis, bermuda, and 
carpet grasses with some Angleton grass and volunteer 
native grasses. Lespedeza and white Dutch clover were 
also present. In the spring of 1931 the land was flat- 
broken, disked, then the seed was broadcast and harrowed 
in. No fertilizer was applied. 

The native pasture consisted largely of little bluestem 
with some big bluestem, bush bluestem, a small amount of 
carpet and bermuda grasses, and a considerable amount of 
native weeds such as milkweed, ragweed, myrtle bushes, 
and sulphur weed. 

The same pastures were used each year. 

Seven steers were grazed on 17.5 acres of improved per- 
manent pasture without supplementary feed, while seven 
other steers which were grazed on 17.5 acres of native pas- 
ture required a supplement of prairie hay from January 
to March each year. 

The cattle were grade Hereford yearling steers at the 
beginning of the experiment, and were in fair range con- 
dition. They were pastured continuously throughout the 
year. A shed was provided in each pasture.

Improving and Maintaining Pasture Land in Mississippi 

Conducted by: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at : State College, Mississippi. 
Period: 1930-1939. 

Purpose: To determine the labor and cost of improving 
and maintaining permanent pasture. 

Procedure and conditions: Several years prior to the 
starting of this test 6 acres of land on rather steep hill side 
and unsuitable for cultivation was stopped of gullies, ferti- 
lized with 12.5 tons barnyard manure per acre, and planted 
to grasses and clovers for pastures for which it was well 
suited. At the time this project was started there was a 
good sod of grasses and clovers and it would have been call- 
ed a good pasture. This was set aside to be used as a pas- 
ture for the dairy cows. During the 10 years of the ex- 
periment an average of 2.6 tons of barnyard manure was 
applied each year. 

Four cows, or one cow for each 31/2 acres of pasture and 
cropland, were originally selected. This provided only II/2 
acres of pasture per cow, which would have been insuffi- 
cient except for the fact that several years had been spent 
in making this 6 acres a good pasture. Due to this and 
further improvement of pasture land throughout the ex- 
periment, it was possible later on to increase the number 
of cows from four to six, so that the average pasturage per 
cow for the 10 years was 1.25 acres. This area furnished 
pasture for an average of 257 days per year.

PART III 

PASTURE LAND 
Selecting Land for Pastures 

The question of what land to use for pasture is one of 
the most critical pasture problems confronting Mississippi 
farmers. Too, this problem varies widely from farm to 
farm, and from one soil area to another in the State. Some 
of the prevalent situations which present this question as 
a definite problem are: 

Bottom or Hill Land 

In some areas of the State the bottomland is very poorly 
drained and consequently is ill adapted to tilled crops. On 
many farms such land has been cleared and cropped for a 
time. Farmers may even be still attempting to crop it but 
the risk of crop failure is great. Where such conditions 
exist the best use of such land is usually grass, either pas- 
ture or hay, or some of both. In this kind of situation it 
would probably be best to use hill land for crops and bottom- 
land for pasture and hay for livestock. 

Moisture 

Closely related to the question of hill and bottomland for 
pasture is that of the effect of moisture on good pasture. 
Because bottomlands usually hold moisture longer during 
critical periods, they make better pasture than hill land. 
This is not to say that there is not much good hill pasture 
land in the State. Here again, the susceptibility of hill 
land to drouth is a major factor in the pasture possibilities 
of such land. Thus, generally speaking, dry sandy hill soils 
are not as well adapted to pasture development as bottom 
soils. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



35 



Competition with Other Uses for the Same Land 

If cattle farming (dairy or beef) were the most prof- 
itable use of land in Mississippi, generally, or on any par- 
ticular farm, then the answer to the question of what land 
to put in pasture would always be the land that will produce 
the best pasture. Often this best pasture land is also the 
best land for cotton or some other crop. Under such con- 
ditions one must decide which is the most profitable way 
to use this dual purpose ''best" land. If the most profit- 
able use is some other crop, then on such a farm it is best 
to grow the maximum amount of such crop. It may be 
that a farmer on such land may not have enough labor to 
put all his best land in this most profitable crop and, in 
this case, his whole farm business may be improved by us- 
ing some of this best land for pasture. During critical la- 
bor shortage periods, like war times, it may be most profit- 
able to divert much good land (such as cotton land) to pas- 
ture and livestock which do not require much labor. 

It is very important that one figure carefully what is 
the most profitable farm business as a whole when con- 
sidering how much *'best" land to put into pasture. 

On Small Farms 

Many small farmers are utilizing practically all their 
open land in the production of crops from which the re- 
turns per acre are greater than that which could be de- 
rived from livestock. On such farms the question of what 
land, if any, for pasture is most critical. Such farms are 
usually worked with the family labor and consequently la- 
bor in proportion to land is not a problem. Usually on such 
farms the pasture question resolves into the value of pas- 
ture to the farm workstock, the family milk cows, and all 
other livestock consumed on the farm. While there may 
not be a clear-cut answer based on experimental informa- 
tion to the question of what to do about pasture on such 
farms, it is believed that the best thing to do on such farms 
is to take a limited area of the best pasture land on the 
farm and by applying intensive methods of improvement, 
such as seeding and fertilizing, make the very best possi- 
ble pasture. It is believed that this will result in better 



3 6 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

workstock that are more economically fed; better family 
milk cows that are better fed and give more milk; more 
and cheaper meat (pork and beef) for family use ; and prob- 
ably a better income from the farm as a whole. 

Farm with Idle Land 

The idle land on thousands of farms in Mississippi will 
run from a few acres to more than half the acreage of the 
farm. On such farms, the selection of land for pasture has 
to do with the possibility of increasing the total returns 
from such farms by utilizing this heretofore unutilized land 
in pasture. Often much of this land is not in a condition 
that is adaptable to intensive pasture improvement. In the 
most practical sense, the question here is whether to use 
this land for pasture or not use it? On this land will us- 
ually be found some soil that is fertile and well adapted to 
pasture and can be developed by some clearing, mowing 
and possibly seeding, while there may be some other land 
on the same farm on which it would not be economical to 
establish pastures. 

Selection of otherwise unutilized land for pasture and 
making improvements that are practical under existing 
conditions, should receive careful consideration on many 
farms in many sections of Mississippi. 

In any case, it is important that the farmer consider his 
total farm income in figuring out his land use program 
which includes the selection of pasture land. In order to 
figure the greatest total farm income, it is probably nec- 
essary, therefore, that he estimate the cost of production 
and returns in the light of labor, machinery, and invest- 
ment available for the various crops or enterprises in his 
type of farm business so that he might apportion the land 
to these enterprises in such a way as to obtain the greatest 
total returns for the farm. 

A suggestive form is shown in table 15 for estimating 
the cost of establishing and maintaining pasture and re- 
turns from same. A summary of various pasture practices 
in four soil areas in Mississippi are shown on pages 11 to 22. 
These summaries show the practices done and the extent 
of the practices and in the light of present prices these fig- 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



37 



ures might be some basis for figuring the cost of these pas- 
ture improvement practices. Hov^ever, it is not intended 
here to say that the practices used by the farmers in this 
study are the best practices. It does shov^ v^hat has been 
done by 86 farmers surveyed from which survey the ap- 
proximate cost can be calculated and also the approximate 
value of the practices in the form of production or carry- 
ing capacities of the pastures. Also, various fertilizer tests 
are shown on pages 43 to 70 which might be used as a basis 
for calculating the cost of this practice and returns there- 
from. In addition, experimental results on pages 33 and 
93 to 96 might give some basis for determining cost of con-

trolling weeds or undersirable plants and the value of same. 
On pages 26 to 33 experimental tests show the value of im- 
proved pastures compared to unimproved pastures, which 
in most cases, include most all of the so-called improved 
practices. Also, in the same section is shown a summary 
of the study. 

From the information cited above, it seems that a farm- 
er might be able to estimate, fairly accurately, the approx- 
imate cost of establishing and maintaining pastures as well 
as returns therefrom on the form shown in table 15. The 
farmer is already fairly well versed in estimating costs 
and returns from the row crops which he has been grow- 
ing. Therefore, if he is able to calculate the probable re- 
turns from pasture on his farm this should help him to 
decide what land should be devoted to pasture from an 
economical standpoint and from the standpoint of how it 
will effect his total farm income. 

PART IV 

PREPARATION OF LAND FOR PASTURES* 

In establishing pastures, the matter of preparation of 
land is the first consideration. This includes clearing the 
land (in case of new land that has not been in cultivation) 
of bushes, briars and other undesirable growth, terracing 
or drainage, breaking and leveling. 

Experience and observation have definitely shown that 
it is necessary to clear the land of timber, bushes and un- 
desirable plants before satisfactory pastures can be estab- 
lished. When this is done and undesirable plants are kept 
under control, comparatively good pastures have been es- 
tablished with no other treatments where the soil was of 
average fertility. 

Observation has also shown that where hill pasture land 
has been properly terraced, there is more grazing immed- 
iately above the terraces during medium to dry seasons 
than elsewhere in that additional moisture has been stored 
in the soil by the terraces.

More detailed information on this subject is shown be- 
low from Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station ref- 
erences. This information includes some results of tests 
at the main station as well as discussion and recommenda- 
tions. 

Clearing Brush Land 

The Animal Husbandry Department of the Mississippi 
Experiment Station, during the past 10 years, has convert- 
ed into productive permanent pasture approximately 800 
acres of land that was once cultivated but had been aband- 
oned from 2 to 20 years. This land had grown up in 
sprouts, briars, broom sedge and weeds, which had to be 
removed. Hand labor and axes have been used practically 
altogether in the clearing operation. Brush were cut even 
with or below the ground level in order to simplify mow- 
ing and to reduce hand labor involved in resprouting dur- 
ing later years. 

It was found that with the average laborer, very close 
supervision is required in order to get the sprouting work 
done satisfactorily. The tendency is to leave several inches 
of stump above the ground. This kind of clearing makes 
for a poor mowing job, broken machinery, and added ex- 
pense of resprouting for several years. There is very little 
difference in the cost of cutting sprouts up to 3 to 4 inches 
in diameter even with the ground surface, and that of cut- 
ting them several inches or a foot high. The brush was 
piled and left until dry enough to burn. 

On land where broom sedge is reasonably thick, if the 
clearing is done after frost or during the winter, one fir- 
ing will clean the land with the use of a follow-up crew to 
assemble the butts of sprouts left unburned. If broom 
sedge is thin, it may be necessary to use a mowing machine 
to clean the land completely after the brush has been 
burned. 

As was stated above, the cost of getting brush land ready 
for the mowing machine will vary according to the amount 
of brush covering ; however, other factors may be involved. 

During February and March 1941, the Department set 
up a grazing experiment involving the use of 240 acres of 



40 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

land located in the Flatwoods Area about 20 miles south- 
west of Starkville. This land had previously been in cul- 
tivation but had been abandoned for 5 or more years. The 
sprout covering consisted largely of loblolly pine but also 
included oak, gum, and black jack, and varied from quite 
thin to quite thick. Broom sedge covered the entire area 
except the lower, more fertile parts which were covered 
with a thick growth of briars in addition to sprouts. The 
entire area was burned about two weeks after the brush 
was piled, and fortunately the broom sedge was thick 
enough to make the burning complete. 

Cost of clearing, effect of mowing. The total labor cost 
of clearing this tract of land, consisting of 240 acres, was 
$571.36 or $2.38 per acre; however, such costs will most 
likely vary according to the covering and local wages as 
well as machinery available. Since it was cleared, all of 
the acreage has been handled with a mowing machine and 
without the use of hand labor and axes for resprouting. 
In general, it might be observed that where sprouts reap- 
pear it might be necessary to use the mowing machine 
two or three times during the growing periods, and it is al- 
ways advisable to mow at the end of the growing season. 
If sprouts are left they become tough and hard during the 
winter and it will be difficult to do a good mowing job the 
following year. 

During 1941, the year in which land was gotten ready 
for mowing as above described, 3 bulls and 60 mature cows 
and their calves were grazed on the 240 acres, and enough 
hay was cut and stacked at the second mowing to winter 
these animals without additional feed until March 1. It 
appeared at mid-September that no hay would be secured 
at the second clipping that year (1942) due to dry weath- 
er, although grazing had been sufficient. This tract is in- 
cluded in a minerals experiment, and no seeding or sod- 
ding was done, dependence being placed entirely on pasture 
plants (mostly broom sedge) already established or which 
might become established without seeding during the ex- 
periment. This lack of seeding was done for the purpose 
of the experiment and is not recommended as a good pas- 
ture practice ; but the practices of brush-clearing and mow- 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



41 



ing have clearly demonstrated their worth and practica- 
bility. 

Clearing costs. It should be emphasized, first, that this 
land had once been in cultivation and contained only a lim- 
ited number of large trees. The growth of brush was ex- 
tremely thick in some places and thin in others. Second, 
labor was paid at the 1941 rate of 10 cents per hour. For 
these reasons, it is impossible to arrive at even an approx- 
imation of average cost throughout the State, though it is 
believed that much land abandoned from cultivation during 
recent years can be prepared for pasture at a cost that 
would not be prohibitive. 

Mowing to control sprouts. Once the potential pasture 
land is prepared for seeding by cutting of trees, shrubs and 
other undesirable plants, at or below the ground level, it is 
proven by the experience of the Animal Husbandry De- 
partment over a period of 10 years that mowing will ef- 
fectively control sprout growth. By mowing twice a year, 
the sprouts are tender and will be clipped without difficul- 
ty by the mowing machine. By clipping twice a year the 
root systems of the undesirable plants are gradually starv- 
ed out or exhausted so as to be eliminated. At the same 
time, even the numerous sprouts which may occur during 
the first year will not seriously interfere with the growth 
of pasture plants, provided the undesirable plants are clip- 
ped twice by a mower; and the clipping to control sprout 
growth is also highly desirable to control weed growth and 
permit seeded or sodded pasture plants to make good 
growth and become well established. 

Seedbed Preparation, Terracing and Drainage 

The amount of soil preparation necessary in pasture mak- 
ing will vary according to the condition of the land, the 
preceding crop, desirable plants already growing, and the 
amount of undesirable plants present. 

Should land that is to be put to pasture have slope 
enough to be subject to erosion, means should be provided 
for erosion control. Such structures as terraces and di- 
versions should be constructed that will satisfactorily break 
up an excessive accumulation of water and divert this water 



42 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

to natural drainage areas or into well-vegetated areas. 
The construction of mechanical structures is more import- 
ant on land to be seeded, as it prevents the movement of 
seed by flowing water and the starting of gullies before 
the soil is covered with pasture plants. When converting 
previously terraced fields to pasture, the terraces and the 
row system should be reworked so that all rows are on a 
contour and the furrows are shallow enough to allow mow- 
ing. 

Proper drainage is often as important as erosion con- 
trol measures. Especially is this true of the Delta and 
Prairie sections and of fertile bottoms in other sections of 
the State. Many Prairie pastures contain seepage areas 
which may be drained by means of terraces, in which case 
the terraces serve a two-fold purpose. 

Much land to be converted into pastures may have vary- 
ing amounts of desirable plants growing. Thus, common 
lespedeza may be found throughout the Brown Loam Area, 
or hop clover throughout the Prairie. Plowing such land 
might injure or eradicate stands of these plants, and money 
and time could be more profitably spent in eradicating un- 
desirable plants so as to promote the growth of the desir- 
able plants already established and incorporating other 
species desired, than in soil preparation. Plowing should 
be done where there is such a dense growth of undesirable 
weeds or other plants that pasture plant seed might not 
come into contact with the soil. Soil that is caked or too 
hard for root penetration should be loosened by plowing 
or disking. 

In cases where soil preparation is made, it should be 
done far enough in advance of planting for the seedbed to 
become firm. All experimental evidence points to the nec- 
essity for seeding on a firm seedbed. In any case, wheth- 
er with much or little soil preparation, prerequisites for 
pasture development include elimination of obstructions so 
that farm machinery may be used, and the planting of pas- 
ture plant species on a firm seedbed.* 

From contacts made as well as observations and invest- 
igations made in this pasture study it seems that the gen-

in Mississippi," page 5 and 6, State College, Mississippi, July 1941.

eral consensus among farmers and agricultural workers 
in the field is that thorough breaking of soil is not al- 
ways desirable in pastures already established. However, 
if new land that is put into pastures is rough and rugged 
it should be broken enough so that it can be leveled in or- 
der that the pasture may be mowed. Of course there are 
advantages and disadvantages in breaking new pasture 
land. Some of the advantages have already been mentioned 
above; namely, (1) breaking is a means of leveling the 
land so that it can be mowed efficiently (2) Breaking 
may destroy certain noxious weeds or plants. (3) In ad- 
dition, if the land is extremely hard, breaking provides a 
better seedbed if allowed to settle before seed are planted. 
On the other hand there seems to be some disadvantages 
in breaking land, (a) On hill land, erosion is increased un- 
til the land becomes sodded with grasses, (b) Breaking 
destroys cover on the land; such cover, if allowed to re- 
main on the land, would provide some protection for young 
pasture plants, from the hot sun, cold, and grazing, espe- 
cially where the new pasture is heavily grazed. 

PART V 

FERTILIZING PASTURES 

As already pointed out in this bulletin, many farmers 
and agricultural leaders contacted in this study, stated that 
fertilizing pastures gave better results than any other 
practice used. This may be due to the fact that little 
pasture fertilization has been done until recently even on 
pastures that were grazed continuously, thus taking plant 
food out of the soil while but little was put back into the 
soil. Too, a large percentage of the land found in pasture, 
especially hill and terrace land, had previously been grow- 
ing row crops, and no doubt much of such land was pretty 
well depleted of its fertility. On most of the farms sur- 
veyed, improvement practices such as seeding and fertili- 
zation, were made on old established pastures. 

Table 6, which is a summary of the 86 farms surveyed 
in all areas, shows that about 64 percent of the pasture 
land surveyed had been limed during the past 5 years, 
with an average of 863 pounds of lime per acre. About 



44 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

the same percentage had been phosphated with an aver- 
age of 227 pounds per acre. About 30 percent of the land 
had basic slag applied at the rate of 538 pounds per acre, 
while only about 3 percent of the land had an application 
of potash at the rate of 151 pounds per acre. All farmers 
contacted indicated that pastures that had not had an ap- 
plication of fertilizer recently, would receive one in the 
near future. Some farmers were following the practice of 
fertilizing one-third or one-half of their pasture each year 
until the entire pasture was fertilized. 

Experimental results on fertilizing pastures are shown 
on the following pages for various crops, soil types, and 
areas in Mississippi, and in surrounding or nearby states.

out the pasture. One application of lime was made during 
the period, all other treatments being annual applications. 
Check plots were left untreated for comparison. 

Areas of both fertilized and check plots were protected 
from grazing by means of movable cages. Total yields 
were obtained by harvesting the growth at frequent in- 
tervals so as to simulate grazing conditions. Unprotected 
areas of the same size and number, treated and untreated, 
and representative of the growth left by grazing cattle, 
were clipped at the same time. All yields are reported as 
dry matter per acre. The difference between the yields

of the protected areas and yields of the unprotected areas 
represents the quantity of pasture growth that was eaten 
by the grazing dairy animals. These differences are re- 
ported as the percentage of growth not eaten. Four-year 
averages of yields and rate of grazing are reported in 
table 16. 

These 4-year averages show several outstanding and sig- 
nificant results. Surprising may be the effect of liming, 
in that where 4,000 pounds of dolomitic limestone was ap- 
plied in 1937 the yield was less than on the untreated plots 
four seasons later or in 1940. However, there was only 
276.3 pounds of dry matter per acre difference in favor of 
the unlimed plots in 1940. How long this overliming ef- 
fect will remain will be ascertained by further measure- 
ments. These results indicate the advisability of smaller 
amounts of limestone, applied more frequently, when 
broadcast on pastures growing on this type (Grenada silt 
loam) of soil. 

The results obtained by the application of phosphate are 
outstanding. The use of 400 pounds of 20 percent super- 
phosphate, gave a 4-year average increase over the untreat- 
ed plots of 91.38 percent. The use of the heavy amount 
of lime in combination with phosphate reduced the yield to 
less than the yield from phosphate alone. Heavier appli- 
cations of phosphate in combination with 400 pounds of 
lime failed to overcome the overliming effects. The like- 
lihood is that the large amount of lime not only ties up 
the phosphate in unavailable form, but also ties up other 
elements, and that in such combination they are unavail- 
able and are thus the limiting factors for plant growth. 

Further observations of the data show that the applica- 
tion of other elements alone or in combination with lime 
failed to give increases like those obtained with phosphate 
alone. Yearly applications of phosphate gave yearly in- 
creases in plant production. One 400-pound application 
made in 1937, however, with no additional application 
thereafter, was giving an increase over the no-phosphate 
plots 4 years later. This comparison is shown in table 17. 

The manner in which cattle grazed these plots is very 
significant. It will be noticed that where phosphate was 
used there was not only more plant material produced, but 
also the plant material produced was grazed in preference 
to other treatments. This was true whether the phosphate 
was applied alone or in combination with other elements, 
though it was observed that the cattle left more of the 
herbage on plots treated with various elements than they 
did on plots with the same treatments plus phosphate.

Data in table 18 shows that phosphorus again was the 
most efficient and the most profitable element used wheth- 
er the phosphorus was applied alone or in combination with 
other elements. Nitrogen used alone and nitrogen used 
with potash produced less than the unfertilized check, 
whether the plot was limed or unlimed. This was due to 
the early stimulation of grass at the expense of legume 
growth. Potash used alone resulted in a slightly higher 
yield on the limed plots and a slightly lower yield on the 
unlimed plots. 

The data shows that phosphorus with small amounts of 
lime make the best pasture fertilization practice on these 
soils. 

It should be pointed out that overliming is more easily 
done on the sandy types of soil than on those containing 
more silt or clay. For example, the amount of lime needed 
to neutralize (bring to a pH reading of 7.0) a Grenada silt 
loam with an acidity of pH 5.5, would when added to a 
Ruston fine sandy loam of the same degree of acidity 
cause the Ruston to become more than neutral, pH 8.2. 
The sandy soils also contain less minerals for plant growth, 
and nutrients in sandy soils are thus tied up in an unavail- 
able form with less lime than is the case with silt or clay 
soils.

Liming Pastures 

Conducted by: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Pearl River County, Mississippi. 
Period: One year, 1940. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of lime, with superphos- 
phate, on the yield of dry matter. 

Soil: Norfolk very fine sand. 

Procedure and conditions: The response of Norfolk soil 
to small quantities of lime is shown by the yield of pasture 
clippings from a pasture growing on Norfolk very fine sand. 
A carpet grass-lespedeza hill pasture on this soil type in 
Pearl River County was top-dressed in January 1940, with 
varying amounts of dolomitic limestone in combination 200 
pounds of 20 percent superphosphate. The dry matter pro- 
duced per acre is shown in table 19.

These data show that top-dressing with 1,000 pounds of 
hme reduces pasture yields on Norfolk soil, while a 500- 
pound application of lime was highly beneficial. By com- 
paring with the data in table 18 it will be noted that the 
amount of lime which reduced the yield on sandy soil pro- 
duced an increase in yield on a silt loam soil. It should 
be emphasized that these reductions occurred with top- 
dressing without further treatment. Where land is being 
prepared for seeding or when lime is worked into the soil, 
it is possible that greater quantities of lime would be re- 
quired to produce the overliming effects. 



Use of Basic Slag and Potash on Brown Loam Soils 

The effect of basic slag is much the same as that of 
phosphate and lime on the sandy, as well as the silt or 
clay soil types, when pound for pound of available phos- 
phoric acid are applied. The 2-year average dry matter 
yield obtained from top-dressing with comparable amount 
of basic slag and superphosphate and lime on Grenada silt 
loam are: 



Dry matter, 

Treatment pounds per acre 

1000 pounds basic slag 4473.8 

400 pounds 20% super plus 1000 pounds lime 4618.9 



These data indicate that the cost of material and its ap- 
plication would determine which (basic slag or super plus 
lime) to apply to pastures. However, on soils of a low fer- 
tility and where the cost of materials is approximately the 
same, basic slag is preferred because it contains elements 
in addition to calcium and phosphorous. 

On many soils — those that have been heavily cropped 
to lespedeza or other legumes, those where grazing has 



IMPROVINCx PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 49 

been practiced over a long period and legume growth is 
scant, or those of a low fertility — the application of potash 
materially increases the yield of pasture growth. Top- 
dressing an established and heavily grazed pasture on Oli- 
vier (a second-bottom terrace soil of the Brown Loam Reg- 
ion) gave the following 2-year average results:

200 pounds 20% superphosphate.... 5146.1

These data show that soils that are low in potash or 
that have been grazed over a long period of time, give prof- 
itable response to potash applications. 

It may be pointed out that all pasture soils of the State 
may not be as responsive to phosphatic fertilization as is 
the Grenada type. However, the general effect of phos- 
phates is the same: an increase in the legume population 
and its growth. On many soils it is necessary to apply 
lime, phosphorous, and potash to obtain a profitable stand 
of clover.

Comparative Improvement in Pasture through Fertilizing 
and Liming with Results in Terms of Cattle Gains 

Conducted by: Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion, Fayetteville. 

Conducted at: Cotton Branch Station, Marianna. 

Period: 1927-33. 

Purpose: To compare gains made by cattle on fertilized 
and on unfertilized pasture. 

Land history: The land had been in cotton and an occa- 
sional crop of corn for 65 years, without cover crops or 
fertilizers. It had been abandoned as unprofitable for 
farming. 

Soil: The soil was a silty and clayey loam, classified as 
Lintonia silt loam. The land was submarginal; half the 
area was severely eroded and one-third was poorly drain- 
ed. The average degree of slope was 41/2 percent. 

Procedure and conditions: In 1927 the establishment of a 
permanent pasture on the area was begun. Prior to this 
time seedings of common grasses and legumes had failed 



50 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

to give favorable results. The land was plowed in early 
spring and prepared for planting. Furrows 5 to 6 inches 
deep and 2 to 3 feet apart were opened. In these, pieces 
of Bermuda sod were dropped about 2 feet apart, and cov- 
ered. The surface was then smoothed and seed of carpet 
grass, Dallis grass and other grasses, and white clover and 
hop clover (light seeding) were sown on the surface as 
early in spring as practicable. Lespedeza seed was sown 
at the rate of 8 pounds per acre in late March or early 
April and bur clover seed was sown at the rate of 1 bushel 
per acre in July or August for early fall germination. 
When necessary, white clover and hop clover seed were 
sown at the rate of 5 pounds each per acre, usually in Sep- 
tember. If a satisfactory stand of lespedeza did not re- 
sult from the first seeding, a second seeding was made a 
year later. These seedings were made on the surface and 
the soil was not cultivated after the Bermuda grass had 
been set. 

Weeds and tall growth were cut with a mowing machine 
when necessary, usually about May 15 and occasionally in 
August or September. Grazing stock were excluded from 
the area as much as possible. Occasional touching up of 
thin spots was necessary during the next 2 years. 

In 1930 grazing studies were begun on the pasture land. 
Two areas of 3.3 acres each were fenced, and provided with 
shade, salt, and water. One area was fertilized with ni- 
trate of soda, the other was left unfertilized. The experi- 
ment was conducted on the same land continuously. 

Grade Shorthorn and Hereford steers ranging in age 
from 12 to 18 months, lean but of fair quality and weigh- 
ing approximately 250 pounds, were used on the pastures. 
They had been kept and fed as usual, chiefly on roughages, 
prior to being used in the experiment. The cattle were 
divided as evenly as possible between the two areas, on the 
basis of types and weights. They were kept on pastures 
continuously and weighed individually on the 1st and 16th 
of each month during the grazing season. 

During the grazing season the number of animals on 
the pasture was varied as necessary. In dry periods the 
numbers were reduced, and when rains improved the pas- 
ture growth, animals were restored in proportion to the 
improvement made so as to maintain a desirable balance 
between the pasturage available and the number of animals. 
During the early part of the season when the growth of 
legumes was greatest, the fertilized pasture was stocked 
at the rate of nearly four head per acre. An average of 
417 grazing days per year was secured on the fertilized 
pasture and 316 days on the unfertilized pasture. The

The same cattle were used in 1931, but were re-group-

1932 and 1933 (not the same animals both years, however). 

The grazing period each year extended approximately 
from early April to November 1. 

A severe drought occurred late in the 1930 season. The 
1931 season was more favorable, and the 1932 and 1933 
seasons were about average.

Fertilizing Pastures in Black Belt of Alabama 

Conducted by: Alabama Agricultural Experiment Sta-

Conducted at: Marion Junction, Alabama. 
Period: 1933-42. 

Purpose: (1) To compare large amounts of phosphate ap- 
plied at 3-year intervals with smaller applications made 
annually. (2) To determine the increase in pounds of beef 



5 2 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

by the use of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash. (3) to 
find the best adapted group of plans for pastures. 

Soil: From 1932 to 1935, four-acre plots were used, 1 
acre being upland and 3 acres bottomland. From 1936 to 
1942 the plots contained only 3 acres of bottomland. 

Procedure and conditions: In the fall of 1931, all plots 
received a mixture of seed sufficient for a stand of the fol- 
lowing: White clover, black medic, and biennial white and 
annual yellow sweet clovers. Seed sufficient to produce 
a stand of Dallis grass, red top and orchard grass were 
sown on all plots the following spring. In 1935 Kentucky 
blue grass was sown at the rate of 5 pounds per acre. No 
additional seeding of any kind has been done. However, 
heavy grazing, weather extremes, and competition with 
other plants have taken a toll. Several of these species 
have been eliminated in the 12 years. The predominate 
species now are black medic, white clover, Dallis gras'^ and 
bluegrass. However, bluegrass is not as desirable for pas- 
ture as is a rotation of the adapted clovers and Dallis grass. 
Because of its tendency to crowd out the other grasses 
and especially the clovers, bluegrass subsequently suffers 
from the lack of nitrogen. The natural rotation of clovers 
and grasses worked almost ideally. The clovers predom- 
inate in the early season, and then give way to Dallis 
grass in the latter part of the season. The clovers leave 
sufficient nitrogen in the soil to stimulate greatly the 
later crop. Results on fertilizer treatments are shown in 
table 21 and 22.

Fertilizing Upland Pastures 

Conducted by: Alabama Agircultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Auburn, Alabama. 
Period: 1925-32. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of various fertilizer 
treatments on the yield of upland pasture composed of sev- 
eral grasses and legumes. 

Land history: Planted to clean-cultivated crops for at 
least 30 years prior to 1925. The cropping history is not 
available because the land was not under control of the Ex- 
periment Station until 1925. 

Soil: The soil was typical upland Norfolk sandy loam of 
very low natural fertility. The land had a 3 percent slope, 
and there was little erosion. 

Procedure and conditions: Twenty-one plots in duplicate 
were used, each plot being 9 by 12 feet, or 1/403 of an acre 
in area. Duplicate sections were separated by 2-foot alleys 
and unlike sections were separated by 4-foot alleys. Half 
of the plots were limed at the beginning of the experiment. 
The experiment was run continuously on the same land. 

In the fall of 1925, the plots were seeded with bur clover 
at the rate of 27 pounds per acre, and a mixture composed 
of one part each of common and Ladino white clovers and 
two parts of black medic, at the rate of 9 pounds per acre. 
Inoculated soil was scattered over the area. In March 
1926, Dallis grass and common lespedeza were sown on 
these plots at the rate of 20 pounds per acre, and Korean 
lespedeza was sown at the rate of 10 pounds per acre. They 
were covered lightly with a weeder. 

In September 1926, another seeding was made with the 
addition of Carolina clover and hop clover to insure a thick 
stand of plants. In the spring of 1927 the Dallis grass 
seeding was repeated at the rate of 12 pounds per acre. 

In order to determine whether or not centipede grass 
could become established in competition with other pasture 
plants which were already established, six plants of centi- 
pede grass were set on each plot in the experiment in July 
1928. 

Phosphate and potash fertilizers were applied at 5-year 
intervals (except on one plot where they were applied an- 
nually). Two such applications were made, one in the fall 
of 1925 when the phosphate and potash fertilizers were

worked well into the soil when the seedbed was prepared, 
and the other in January 1931 when these materials were 
applied as a top-dressing. Nitrogenous fertilizers were ap- 
plied annually as top-dressings. 

The plants were seeded at rates which were higher than 
would be practical in pastures, because it was desired to 
establish a sod for the experiment as quickly as possible.

MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 



Comparison of Fertilizer Treatments on Yields of 
Dallis, Carpet, and Bermuda Grass 

Conducted by: Alabama Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Auburn, Alabama. 
Period: 1925-1932. 

Purpose: To determine the effects of various fertilizer 
treatments on yields of Dallis, carpet, and Bermuda grass, 
planted alone and as a mixture. 

Land history: The land had been planted to clean-culti- 
vated crops for at least 30 years prior to 1925. The crop- 
ping history is not available because the land was not un- 
der control of the experiment station until 1925. 

Soil: The soil was typical upland Norfolk sandy loam of 
very low natural fertility. The land had a 3 percent slope, 
and was slightly eroded. 

Procedure and conditions: Four sections, each with two 
replications of five plots, were used. Each plot was 9 by 
12 feet, or 1/403 of an acre in area. Sections were sep- 
arated by 4-foot alleys. The experiment was run contin- 
uously on the same land. 

The seedbed was well prepared, and in the fall of 1925 
the entire area was sown to Southern bur clover at the 
rate of 27 pounds per acre, and to a mixture of one part 
of common while clover, one part of Ladino clover, and 
two parts of black medic, at the rate of 9 pounds per acre. 
Inoculated soil was sown with the seed. 

In the spring of 1926 this area was divided into four 
sections. One section was seeded to Dallis grass at the 
rate of 18 pounds per acre; one to carpet grass at the 
rate of 9 pounds per acre; one to Bermuda grass at 
the rate of 9 pounds per acre; and one to all three of the 
grasses at their respective rates. Common lespedeza at 
the rate of 15 pounds per acre, and Korean lespedeza at 
the rate of 10 pounds per acre, were seeded on the entire 
area along with the different grasses. Very few of the 
Bermuda grass seeds germinated and, therefore, sod was 
set in May 1926. In the fall of 1926 the seeding of the 
previous fall was repeated on all sections. In the spring 
of 1927, Dallis and carpet grass were again seeded on their 
respective sections at the rate of 12 pounds per acre. Al- 
though hop clover was not seeded in this experiment, some 
of it scattered from a similar experiment nearby, and by 
1929 there was a scattered stand on the Dallis and carpet 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



57 



grass sections. By the spring of 1930 there was a good 
stand of hop clover on these two sections and some on the 
Bermuda grass section. After 1931 there was a thick stand 
of hop clover on these sections. 

Phosphate and potash materials were applied and work- 
ed into the soil when the seedbed was prepared in 1925. 
In January 1931, a second application was made as a top- 
dressing. Nitrogen was applied annually as a top-dressing. 
On some of the plots ground limestone was applied along 
with the phosphate and potash in the fall of 1925. No 
lime was applied after that date. 

In order to simulate heavy grazing, the grass was har- 
vested with the cutter bar of the lawn mower set as low 
as practicable. The lawn mower had a basket attachment. 
The plots were harvested as often as there was sufficient 
growth. This was considered a more accurate method of 
determining the results than actual grazing. 

Bur, common, and Ladino white clovers, and black medic 
were winter-killed in January 1928 and practically none of 
these plants grew after that date. Lespedeza failed to 
mature enough seed to propagate itself during the two dry 
seasons of 1930 and 1931, so there were only a few of these 
plants on any plots in 1932.

IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



59 



Period: 1931-34. 

Purpose : To compare yields of Bermuda grass, carpet 
grass, and centipede grass on upland soil fertilized with 
various combinations of a 6-12-6 (NPK) mixture applied 
(in whole and split applications) at the rate of 600 pounds 
per acre. 

Land history: In cultivated field crops previous to 1931. 

Soil: The centipede and Bermuda grass pastures were 
on fairly moist Tifton sandy loam and the soil of the carpet 
grass pasture bordered on Norfolk sandy loam. The land 
sloped gently and there was no erosion. 

Procedure and conditions: Plots were 1/200 acre in size 
and were duplicated. Plots were separated by 19-inch al- 
leys of sod. Carpet grass was planted from seed ; Bermuda 
grass and centipede grass were set from runners. 

Fertilizer was applied each year, all in the spring, un- 
less otherwise indicated in table 26. 

Cuttings were made during the grazing season at 3-week 
intervals with a power lawn mower. 

The experiment was conducted continously on the same 
land, the treatment of each plot being the same each year. 

The 4-year (1931-34) average rainfall for the period 
March 1 to October 1 was 32.77 inches, and the average 
annual rainfall for the 4-year period was 43.24 inches. 

Reference: United States Department of Agriculture, Ag- 
ricultural Adjustment Administration Bulletin SRAC-5,

ington, D. C, June 1938. 

Lowland Permanent Pasture Fertilizer Test 
Conducted by: Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1931-40. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of various fertilizer 
treatments on beef cattle gains on lowland pastures. 

Soil: Plummer sandy loam. 

Land history: Originally the land was covered with dense 
swamp growth consisting of pine, black gum, poplar, gall- 
Derries, groundsel, briars, and wiregrass. 



GO MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

Procedure and conditions: Clearing and draining was 
started in 1926. At that time only one pasture was com- 
pleted, namely, the carpet grass-lespedeza pasture which 
had been used as a check, or unfertilized area. 

In 1928 and 1929 continuation of this work was carried 
on north of and adjoining the original area, and in the 
spring of 1929 four more pastures were seeded. The new 
seeding consisted of a mixture of carpet grass 8 pounds, 
Dallis grass 4 pounds, lespedeza 10 pounds, and white clov- 
er 3 pounds per acre. Later data indicate that a better 
stand and quicker sod is secured by planting carpet grass 
10 pounds, Dallis grass 8 pounds, common lespedeza 12 
pounds, and white clover 5 pounds per acre. Fertilizer 
was applied but no grazing was possible the first year 
for lack of fence. In 1930 grazing was carried on but no 
records kept except for pasture number one. Pastures 
were gone over and reseedings made on bare spots the 
following spring. 

Fertilizer was applied for each pasture. All of the sup- 
erphosphate and potash and one-half of the nitrogen was 
put on about the middle of March. The other half of the 
nitrogen was applied around July 20. The materials used 
were superphosphate, muriate of potash, and nitrate of 
soda, without making comparisons with other sources of 
fertilizer. 

The number of steers on a pasture was kept the same 
throughout the year when possible. Sometimes weather 
conditions made it necessary to add or remove an animal 
or two. Under these circumstances weights were taken 
and the pasture given credit for the gain or loss. 

Pasture upkeep consisted of the fertilizer application 
and two or three mowings each year. 

For the 5-year period previous to 1936 the lowland pas- 
tures, except the check, received fertilizer every year as 
indicated below. In 1936, only nitrate of soda was applied 
to pastures where nitrogen was in the formulas, the 
plan being to apply nitrogen every year, but phosphate 
and potash only every third year. Fertilizers are express- 
ed in ammonia, phosphorus and potash (NPK) in the order 
named. Nitrates are figured on ammonia basis. (Am- 
monia is equivalent to 82.3 percent nitrogen.) 

The series of lowland pastures is numbered as follows: 

1. Lowland permanent pasture of carpet grass and les- 
pedeza which received no fertilizer. (Check pasture). 

2. Lowland permanent pasture of carpet grass, Dallis 
grass, lespedeza and white clover which received 600 pounds 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



61 



6-12-6 fertilizer per acre each year through 1935. After 
1935 complete fertilizer was applied every 3 years except 
the nitrogen part of the formula which was applied every 
year. 

3. Lowland permanent pasture of carpet grass, Dallis 
grass, lespedeza and white clover which received 600 pounds 
6-12-0 fertilizer per acre each year through 1935. After 
1935 phosphate fertilizer was applied only every 3 years 
and nitrogen was applied every year. 

4. Lowland permanent pasture of carpet grass, Dallis 
grass, lespedeza and white clover which received 600 pounds 
6-0-0 fertilizer per acre each year. 

5. Lowland permanent pasture of carpet grass, Dallis 
grass, lespedeza and white clover which received 600 pounds 
0-0-6 fertilizer per acre each year through 1935.

Pasture number one which received no fertilizer was 
principally carpet grass. The sod was so compact that 
very little lespedeza remained after 1931. No tests were 
conducted in this pasture in 1935 because part of the pas- 
ture was plowed to destroy patches of sedge and wire- 
grass.

Upland Permanent Pasture Fertilizer Tests 
Conducted by : Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1932-40. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of complete fertilizer 
on Bermuda grass and common lespedeza pasture. 

Soil: Norfolk and Tifton sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: One-third of this pasture was 
turned each year to keep Bermuda grass from becoming 
sod-bound, to control unpalatable weeds, and to cover crop- 
pings of manure. 

In turning this land a two-horse plow was used in early 
March. When an area was turned a seeding of lespedeza 
— 12 to 15 pounds per acre — followed immediately because 
where land was completely turned lespedeza seed were cov- 
ered too deep for reseeding. 

The above cultural practice means a turning of Bermuda 
sod every 3 years and also a seeding of lespedeza every 3 
years immediately after the turning operation. 

Flat breaking the land encouraged the growth of some 
weeds like Florida pursley, Richardia scabra, and crab 
grass, Digitaria sp., but these are palatable weeds and cat- 
tle grazed them freely. Palatable weeds of this type are 
not a serious pest and seldom require mowing. 

Before the spring of 1936 this Bermuda pasture receiv- 
ed no fertilizer. Beginning in 1936, 600 pounds of 6-12-6 
fertilizer per acre were applied. This pasture received 
phosphorus and potash every third year, while the nitrogen 
was applied every year, one-half in the spring and one- 
half in the summer. 

In 1934, a very low gain of 59.6 pounds per acre was re- 
corded. It will be noted that 10 steers were used and the

Fertilizing Permanent Pastures 

Conducted by: Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1931-40. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of various fertilizers on 
beef production. 

Land history: Originally the land was covered with scat- 
tered timber, briars and bushes. It was cleared, stumped 
and drained with a central open ditch and lateral ditches 
along the edge of the lowland to cut off hill seepage water 
where necessary. 

Soil: Plummer sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: At the beginning of this test, 
1931 through 1935, the lowland permanent pastures re-

ceived nitrogen, phosphate, and potash. One-half of the 
nitrogen was appHed in the spring about March 15, and the 
remaining one-half as a top-dressing about July 20. After 
1935, the nitrogen was applied each year while phosphate 
and potash were applied only every third year. 

Animals used for grazing were grade Hereford steers 
averaging about 400 pounds when put on pastures. They 
were kept on the pasture continuously through the grazing 
period without any other feed. A mineral mixture of mar- 
ble dust (lime), steamed bonemeal (phosphate), and salt, 
in equal parts, was kept available to the steers at all times. 
The steers were weighed at regular 4-week intervals.

cording to their carrying capacity throughout the pasture 
season with feeder steers. Data as to carrying capacity 
and beef produced per acre have been recorded for four 
consecutive trials. In addition to these data, caged areas 
are clipped at regular intervals, weights recorded, and

Fertilizing Pastures in Louisiana 

Conducted by: Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Sta-

Conducted at: Ringgold, Louisiana. 
Period: 1941-42. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of various fertilizers 
on the yield of hay and beef gains. 

Land history: Land had been planted to cotton for many 
years and yields had reduced to a very low point. 



66 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 



Soil: Ruston fine sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: On the farm of E. C. Parker, 
at Ringgold, a field of 21 acres, formerly in corn and cot- 
ton, was divided into three pastures of 7 acres each. One 
field received one-half ton of lime per acre and 300 pounds 
of mixed (3-12-8) fertilizer. One field was left unfertiliz- 
ed and one was treated with 300 pounds of 3-12-8 fertilizer 
without lime. The pastures were seeded with Bermuda 
grass, Dallis grass and white Dutch clover, black medic, 
hop clover, and common lespedeza. An adjoining field. 
No. 4 (9.7 acres) then in pasture, was replowed, treated 
with 400 pounds of basic slag per acre and seeded with 
Dallis grass, white Dutch clover, and lespedeza. 

An excellent stand of lespedeza was produced on all fields 
in the summer of 1941. 

In the spring of 1942, pasture 4 (basic slag), carried 30 
head of yearling cattle on dV-) acres from April 4 to May 
1 and from July 7 to August 7, a total of 58 grazing days. 

The lime and fertilizer plot seem to have the poorest 
soil of the first three plots. Evidently Mr. Parker had 
been using fertilizers in the past years on all this area 
and there was evidently some initial effect of previous 
fertilization in field 2. The results are not shown for 
1943 ; however, another half ton of lime per acre was add- 
ed on the lime field and 300 pounds of 0-14-14 per acre on 
fields 1 and 3. 

In 1944 the unfertilized pasture showed up more poorly 
than in previous years and the lime plot proved to be in

much better condition than ever before. In October the 
lime field still looked green while the unfertilized field 
was brown. 

The basic slag field, number 4, is not strictly compar-

Fertilizing Pastures in Louisiana 

Conducted by: Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Lake Charles, Louisiana. 
Period: 1944. 

Purpose: To compare the effect of different fertilizer 
treatments on beef gains. 

Soil: Calcasieu. 

Procedure and conditions: A number of these pastures 
were undergrazed, although the check field was probably 
eaten down lower than the others. At one time the No. 
1 lot broke through into the No. 2 field, but just for how 
many days we do not know. It seemed that in field 6 there 
was a much heavier growth of coarse grass than in the 
next field with Ca Metaphosphate alone or in any of the 
others. A large amount of sedge and other unpalatable 
grasses were present on these pastures.

Fertilizing Pastures to Control Broom Sedge 

Conducted by: Tennessee Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Middle Tennessee Experiment Station, Co- 
lumbia, Tennessee. 

Period: 1928-1933 
1928-1934 

Purpose: To determine the effect of pasturing and use 
of legumes on control of broom sedge. 

Soil : Maury silt loam, brown-colored and of good fertility. 

Procedure and conditions: In 1927 the Middle Tennessee 
Experiment Station began a study of broom-sedge eradi- 
cation. It was necessary to secure a stand in order that 
control measures might be brought into use. An area was 
well prepared and seeded to broom sedge in the early part 
of the year. Bluegrass and white clover were sown with 
the sedge, and good stands of all were obtained. A leased 
acreage, already well established in broom sedge, was added 
in 1928, and eradication methods were started. 

In both cases the land on which broom-sedge-control 
methods were used is so well supplied with phosphoric 
acid that no effects have ever been noted from additional 
applications of this plant food. Therefore, the use of a 
phosphate fertilizer was left out of consideration; and 
for a similar reason potash fertilizer was not used. It 
was assumed from the results of other experiments that 
the main soil deficiencies were nitrogen and lime. 

The area sown was divided into four equal plots. One, 
a check plot, was left in the sedge grass, with the blue- 
grass and white clover. Common lespedeza was sown over 
a second plot, hop clover over a third, and sweet clover 
over a fourth. One-half of each plot was limed. Notes 
on stands were taken, beginning in 1928, and are recorded 
in table 35. Pasturing was started in 1929 and continued 
from year to year through 1933. It should be noted here 
that white clover soon disappeared and was not an import- 
ant factor. 

Always it was the aim to pasture all plots closely in 
the spring and early summer. Later in the season, when 
the grass grew up again, use was also made of this growth. 
In 1929 and 1930 the sedge-grass plots were pastured so 
closely that no gains in weight per acre were made by the 
cattle. However, in 1931, 1932 and 1933, the average gains 
in weight per acre were very satisfactory. The gains on 
the check plot, where the sedge grass had no companion 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



69 



crop except bluegrass and a trace of white clover, were 
150 pounds of beef per acre. The average gain per acre 
on the hop clover plot was 200 pounds. These were very 
satisfactory gains, especially when it is remembered that 
1931 was the year of the severe drouth. Lime had but 
little effect except on the sweet clover plot. Had there 
been more white clover, the lime would have proved of 
greater value. 

In 1928 approximately an acre of land that was covered 
with broom sedge was leased for making further control 
studies. This was old crop land that had been seeded 
down to mixed pasture for several years but had become 
well set with sedge grass. Very little of the grass mixture 
was left. On this particular acre there were some hop 
clover and wild onions and a little common lespedeza. 

The sedge grass was mowed and raked off, the land was 
disked and harrowed to make a seedbed, and a mixture of 
bluegrass and white clover was sown. The year was fav- 
orable, and a good set was established. The mower was 
used on this acre and surrounding parts of the field often 
enough to prevent sedge grass from forming seed. Three 
mowings were required that year, but usually two were 
enough, and when combined with pasturing, sometimes one 
mowing was sufficient. 

A portion of land was manured with stable manure at 
the rate of 6 tons per acre at the outset and again in 3 
years. Another area was treated annually the middle of 
March, with 200 pounds of nitrate of soda, and still an- 
other with 150 pounds of sulfate of ammonia. A larger 
amount of land was left untreated. The entire area was 
mowed at the same time and pastured the same way. In 
1929, pasturing with young cattle was begun, the mower 
being used to take care of the broom sedge that was left. 
The cattle were weighed on and off the area, so that gains 
could be determined. Also a record of the number of days 
they were carried was computed on the basis of 1,000- 
pound animals. The results in getting rid of sedge grass 
are given in tables 34 and 35.

Lime and Fertilizer Distributing Equipment 

One of the major problems many Mississippi farmers 
have in fertilizing and liming pastures, is the matter of 
getting this material distributed on the land. Several 
types of distributing equipment are shown below. Two 
of the types, namely the knocker type and the whirler 
type, can be made in the average community farm shop. 
The former is fastened to a regular 2-horse wagon body 
and the cost of materials is only a few dollars. The latter 
is made from the rear axle of an old automobile and some 
additional sheet steel and angle or strap-iron which can 
usually be secured from junk yards. This spreader costs 
a few dollars more than the former type but rarely ever 
exceeds $35.00 for cost of materials excepting rubber tires. 

These two lime or fertilizer spreaders are used in Mis- 
sissippi principally by small farmers or farmers with small 
pastures who can not justify the purchase of high cost 
spreaders. 

Many farmers in Mississippi with large pastures use 
some type of commercial spreader similar to those shown 
in figures 5, 6, and 7. This is probably true because they 
are easier to operate and material can be distributed fast- 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI

er, yet the cost per acre is not prohibitive due to large pas- 
ture acreages involved. 

Detailed blueprints v^ith bill of materials and specifi- 
cations may be secured from the Mississippi Agricultural 
Extension Service, State College, Mississippi for the spread- 
ers shown in figures 2, 3 and 4. Persons desiring these 
blueprints may write directly to: Mississippi Agricultural 
Extension Service, Agricultural Engineering Department,

PART VI 

SEEDING PASTURES 

Study of Plants Found Before and After Seeding and 
Seeding Practices 

Brown Loam Area. Table 36 below shows a summary 
of the most common pasture plants found before any seed- 
ing was done, the plants that were seeded, and the num- 
ber of farms on which satisfactory stands were found at 
the time of this study which was from 1 to 4 years after 
seed were sown. This study was made on 23 farms in the 
Brown Loam Area. 

In practically all cases seedings and other improvements 
were made on old established pastures; that is a sod of 
some kind was present on the land before treatments were 
made. 

Dallis grass, white Dutch clover, and lespedeza were the 
principal plants seeded in the Brown Loam Area on the 
farms studied. However, yellow hop was sown on five 
farms. The first three plants mentioned, along with Ber- 
muda, were found on a large percentage of the farms at 
the time of the study. 

Notations made at the time of the surveys, show that 
the satisfactory stands of Dallis and white Dutch clover 
were most often found on the more fertile and moist soils. 
On the other hand, satisfactory stands of lespedeza and 
hop clover were found on the higher and thinner soils. In

addition, Bermuda grass was found more often on the ter- 
race and hill soils. The Bermuda grass, however, may 
have been established previous to the time that the land 
was put to pasture ; at least it was established on 15 farms 
before and the same number after seedings and other 
treatments were made. It should be noticed that with the 
use of seedings, fertilizer and other improvement prac- 
tices, carpet had a tendency to fade out. Broom sedge 
disappeared completely. 

On the higher and thinner soils grazing was found to 
be very poor during the dry fall season of 1944. In view 
of this fact, a few farmers had planted lespedeza sericea, 
and indications are that this plant will survive the drought 
on upland soil and provide fair to good grazing. The plant 
is not highly palatable but cattle were eating the sericea 
when other plants were not available and they were eat- 
ing it much better when the plants were young and tender. 
It was necessary to mow the sericea at regular intervals 
unless it was grazed closely in order to keep the plants 
from getting too large, weedy, and unpalatable. However, 
lespedeza sericea probably has not been used long enough 
as a pasture plant to determine whether or not it is desir- 
able or successful as such. On the other hand, it may 
offer some promise for additional grazing during droughty 
seasons on upland soils. 

South Mississippi Area. Table 37 shows a summary of 
the most common pasture plants found before seeding 
and other improvement practices were made, also the plants 
that were seeded and number of farms on which satisfac- 
tory stands were found after treatments were made ac- 
cording to each plant listed. This check was made on 32 
farms in 7 different counties in South Mississippi. 

Only a few of the pastures checked were new pastures 
at the time seeding and other improvement practices were 
done, the majority of them being old pastures already es- 
tablished with a sod from native pasture plants. 

The principal plants in these pastures before any seed- 
ing or other improvement practices were made, were carpet 
grass and lespedeza. A few of the pastures had Bermuda 
and broom sedge. A large percentage of these pastures 
were then seeded to Dallis grass, white Dutch clover, and 



76 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

lespedeza, while yellow hop was sown on slightly less than 
one-third of the farms. Bermuda and carpet were sown 
on only two farms. 

After seeding and other treatments were given, Dallis 
grass, carpet grass and white Dutch clover were found on 
about the same number of farms, or approximately 20; 
however, the white Dutch and Dallis were always found on 
the lower, more moist and fertile soils. Lespedeza was 
found on more farms than any other plant, or 28 of the 32 
farms. Carpet and lespedeza were found more often on 
the higher and less fertile soils, although, some lespedeza 
and carpet were found on the lower soils. It should be 
pointed out again, as was the case in the Brown Loam 
Area, that broom sedge faded out completely with the use 
of pasture improvement practices.

Table 38 shows that the principal grasses found prior 
to the use of pasture improvement practices were Ber- 
muda, Dallis and carpet, although Bermuda was found on 
as many farms as both Dallis and carpet. The principal 
legume found on these pastures was lespedeza. Lespedeza, 
white Dutch clover and Dallis were sown on over three- 
fourths of the farms checked, while Bermuda, carpet, and 
yellow hop were sown on a few of the farms. 

After this seeding was done, along with fertilizing and 
other pasture improvement practices shown on page 16, 
table 3, satisfactory stands of white Dutch clover, lespe- 
deza, and Dallis grass were found on 15, 16, and 18 of the 
20 farms, respectively. It should be pointed out again 
that broom sedge faded out of the picture and carpet grass 
had a tendency to fade out. However, table 3 shows that 
better than 40 percent of the pasture land was in bottoms 
and notes made at the time of the surveys, show that on 
practically all of the 20 farms studied the hill land devoted 
to pasture was high in fertility compared to the other hill 
lands in that area as well as other sandy land areas. This 
may be due to the fact that most of the surveys were 
made in an area where intensive dairying is done and

Prairie Area. Only 11 farms were surveyed in the Prai- 
rie Area and they were not typical farms for that area 
as to soil type and size or number of acres in pasture, 
more especially as to soil type. Therefore, the seeding 
practices and the plants found before and after seeding 
and other pasture improvement practices are not shown 
here in tabular form. Of the 11 farms studied, white 
Dutch clover, lespedeza and Dallis grass were sown on 
about three-fourths of the farms and the same three 
plants were the principal ones found in satisfactory stands 
after seeding and other improvement practices were made, 
Bermuda and yellow hop being found on only about 33 
percent of the pastures. 

Discussion of Various Pasture Plants and their 
Establishment* 

Dallis Grass 

Dallis grass is a fast-growing perennial bunch grass with 
a deep root system. It produced many basal leaves, which, 
following grazing or drought, makes a more rapid recov- 
ery than any other of our pasture grasses. It is propa- 
gated by seed produced on long (1 to 4 feet), upright seed 
stalks. It grows over a long season, being the first of the 
summer grasses to begin growth in the spring and the 
last to be frosted in the fall. In the spring it will furnish 
good grazing several weeks earlier than Bermuda. 

This grass is adapted to a wide variety of soils. It 
makes its best growth on bottomland soils because of 
more soil fertility and soil moisture. It will thrive on low- 
er land than carpet grass, and will grow higher on the hills. 
It is more tolerant to excessive soil moisture, and at the 
same time is more drought resistant than Bermuda or 
carpet grass. It grows well on all soils except the extreme- 
ly sandy ones. 

Dallis grass, being a bunch grass, grows in clumps and 
will not completely cover the soil with a dense sod. How-

ment Station, State College, Mississippi.

ever, this is an advantage in that it makes Dallis partic- 
ularly adapted to associated growth with other desirable 
pasture plants, especially the legumes. This may be shown 
by the results of a greenhouse experiment run on three 
soils with Dallis grass and white Dutch clover. 

Association with clovers. Used in this test was Sarpy 
sandy loam, a fertile Delta soil; Grenada silt loam, a med- 
ium-fertile hill soil of the Brown Loam Area ; Ruston sandy 
loam, a medium-fertile soil of the Coastal Plains. The 
analysis of the soils used is as follows:

Two series of plots were used on each of the three soil 
types. One series of plots consisted entirely of Dallis 
grass plants. The other series of plots consisted of Dallis 
grass and white Dutch clover plants growing in combina- 
tion. This combination contained the same total number 
of plants, as the grass plots, but one-third of the total 
number were Dallis grass plants and the other two-thirds 
of the total number were white Dutch clover plants. For 
every three Dallis grass plants growing on one series of 
plots there was one Dallis grass plant and two white Dutch 
clover plants growing on the series of plots having the 
grass and clover combination. Thus, each plot on each 
soil type contained the same number of plants regardless 
of whether this total number was made up of grass plants 
alone or of a combination of grass and clover plants.

The yield of dry matter produced per acre of five cut-

Establishing Dallis grass." Along with the advantages, 
however, Dallis grass has the disadvantage of being dif- 
ficult to establish by ordinary methods of seeding. This 
is due to seed of a low percentage germination and to in- 
effective methods of seeding. That Dallis grass can be 
successfully established in spite of low quality seed has 
been shown by tests of methods of seeding pasture grass 
conducted by the Mississippi Agricultural Experiment 
Station. 

Seeding 8 pounds of domestic Dallis grass seed per acre 
under varying practices gave the following results.

Broadcast -- No preparation 0.5 

Mulched — No preparation 6.0 

Prepared -- Open furrows 5.0 

Prepared — Open furrows — Harrowed 9.0 



From the results shown in the table, it may be seen that 
soil preparation very materially increased the stand of 
grass, and that the increase in stand was in proportion to 
the amount of preparation. When seed were slightly mix- 
ed with soil there were nearly twice the number of plants 
as where planted in open rows without mixing. Prepara- 
tion by open furrows only was 10 times as effective as 
no preparation. Seeding broadcast, as is ordinarily done, 
gave only one plant every 2 square feet. This test shows 
clearly the advantage of preparation if it be nothing more 
than a furrow to hold the seed in place. 

It should be kept in mind that most pasture grass seed 
are slow to germinate. The time necessary to obtain an 
official germination test for Dallis and Kentucky blue- 
grass is 28 days. Therefore, any method of seeding should 
provide that the seed should lay where they fall when

sown. Herein lies the advantage of mulching, or of plant- 
ing in a furrow, and of lightly covering the seed in the 
furrow by harrowing. 

Probably the most significant result of this work is the 
stand obtained by means of mulching. Where mulched, 
there were 12 times more plants than when planted broad- 
cast. This is a very satisfactory method of establishing 
Dallis grass. Excellent results have been obtained when 
mulching has been done at the rate of 1 ton of cut material 
per 3 acres. 

Methods of seeding. Where extreme difficulty in estab- 
lishment is anticipated or experienced, a practical proce- 
dure is to: 

(1) Thoroughly prepare an area. 

(2) Sow 6 to 8 pounds per acre of Dallis grass seed in 
narrow rows and harrow lightly. 

(3) Allow to mature seed. 

(4) Mow and scatter the entire mass where Dallis grass 
is desired, at the rate of 1 ton of the cut material 
to 3 acres. 

The same satisfactory results may be obtained by pro- 
tecting already existing stands against grazing and weed 
growth, and mowing and scattering the cut material in 
the same manner. 

Excellent results have also been obtained by sowing 4 
to 6 pounds of seed in scooter furrows spaced 3 to 4 feet 
apart and allowing the resulting Dallis grass plants to seed 
and fall over. In test plots where plants were spaced 2 
feet apart in rows which were 3 feet apart and allowed to 
seed, there was produced the next spring a stand of 15 
plants per square foot. 

These seed tests have led to the following recommenda- - 
tions : 

(1) Where possible, sow Dallis grass on a prepared but 
firm seedbed in narrow rows, and lightly harrow. 

(2) If sowing for the first time on old pasture, run shal- 
low furrows 3 to 5 feet apart, and sow seed in the furrow. 



82 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

(3) Where material from a cut-over Dallis grass area 
is available, mulch new areas where Dallis is desired at 
the rate of 1 ton for every 3 acres. 

Dallis grass should be seeded from September to May. 
Like Bermuda sodding, the supply of moisture is more im- 
portant than the time of seeding, and early seeding per- 
mits the establishment of plants while moisture is usually 
abundant. Mulching may be done at the time of cutting 
mature Dallis grass. Under any method of seeding it is 
extremely important that Dallis plants be allowed to be- 
come fully established before heavy grazing or mowing 
is done. A good practice to follow is to allow seed stalks 
to begin showing before permitting heavy grazing. 

Bermuda Grass 

Bermuda is a low, sod-forming, perennial grass. It is 
commonly propagated by means of both surface runners 
and underground rootstocks. These growth characteris- 
tics make it our best soil conserving crop and at the same 
time a serious pest where not wanted. It is at present the 
most widely used permanent pasture grass in the State. 

Bermuda grass is adapted to practically all soils in the 
State that are fairly well drained and not extremely poor. 
Bermuda, like Dallis, is able to make creditable growth 
only on soils of at least a fair level of fertility. 

Bermuda grass makes excellent pasturage when young 
and succulent. With the coming of summer or droughty 
conditions it soon becomes fibrous and unpalatable. 

Establishing Bermuda grass.* Bermuda is propagated 
principally by means of sod parts. The recommended 
method is to place pieces of sod at 3 to 4-foot intervals, 
or to scatter sod parts and cut in with a disk. This meth- 
od is costly, requires a long time for establishment and 
- success is dependent upon moisture conditions. 

Good stands of Bermuda grass are usually difficult to 
obtain by means of seed. Early planting is mandatory for 
establishment, inasmuch as considerable growth must be 
made for the grass to develop storage organs. Seedings

in Mississippi," pages 13 and 14, State College, Mississippi, July, 1941. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



83 



should be made lighter than formerly recommended and 
thus reduce competition between the young seedlings. Seed 
3 to 5 pounds per acre. 

Whether seeded or sodded, Bermuda must be given time 
to establish itself. Grazing soon after germinating or sprig 
sodding will weaken the plants and prevent formation of 
enough rootstocks for complete ground coverage. Recent- 
ly sodded areas should be grazed lightly, if at all, to per- 
mit complete coverage of the ground. One to 2 years are 
necessary for the establishment of a full sod. 

Were it not for expensive establishment, lack of drought 
resistance, becoming fibrous soon in the season, and were 
it not a pest where fields are to be rotated, Bermuda 
would be our best summer pasture grass. 

Carpet Grass 

Carpet grass is also a low, sod-forming, perennial grass. . 
It is propagated by seed and by creeping plant parts. Be- 
ing adapted to moist bottomlands, carpet grass forms a 
dense sod which is difficult to eradicate. Too, the density 
of the sod makes it extremely difficult for other pasture 
plants to grow in combination with carpet grass. 

Pastures in areas where conditions are favorable for the 
growth of carpet grass, as in South Mississippi, usually 
have only this grass for grazing. 

Establishing carpet grass.* Seedings of carpet grass, 
like Bermuda and Dallis, must be given time for establish- 
ment. Seedings at the Natchez Branch Experiment Sta- 
tion have shown that it takes 2 years for establishnient 
by means of seed, even when sown on a prepared seedbed 
at the rate of 15 pounds per acre. So prevalent is this 
grass in regions of South Mississippi, however, that clear- 
ing the land of trees and brush results in complete ground 
coverage the second year without seeding. 

White Dutch Clover 

White Dutch clover is the best spring pasture clover for 
the majority of Mississippi pastures. It is a shallow root-

in Mississippi," page 14, State College, Mississippi, July 1941. 



84 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

ed, perennial plant that creeps on the surface and takes 
root at the joints. This clover gives grazing over a longer 
period than any other of our spring clovers because of its 
indeterminate habit of growth — growing, blossoming, and 
seeding at the same time. It seeds profusely throughout 
its growing season, and with the coming of dry weather 
will lie dormant until moisture conditions are favorable 
when it again begins growth, blossoming, and seeding. 
The other pasture clovers, being determinate in their habit 
of growth, finish their growth when they have seeded. 
This plant habit often causes white Dutch to yield more 
plant material per acre than many other more upright 
growing clovers. 

White Dutch clover is adapted to all soils of the State 
where moisture is sufficient for its growth, its first re- 
quirement being a soil well suppHed with moisture. This 
is ;^vhy it will be found more frequently in the bottomlands 
of the hill section of the State and will do better on the 
heavier Delta soils under average conditions. Like other 
crops. White Dutch does best on fertile soils but will grow 
well on any soil that will produce the common pasture 
grasses. Much of our Delta soil, because of its high silt 
content, poor drainage, and consequent high moisture con- 
tent will grow clover and grass to advantage. 

Comparative yield of clovers. Where moisture and fer- 
tility are not limited, white Dutch clover will yield hay in 
quantities comparable with our commonly used clovers. 
In an experiment conducted on Memphis silt loam at the 
Natchez Branch Station, all clover seeded in October at 
the rate of 8 pounds per acre and harvested when in full 
bloom, produced in the spring of 1941 the following amounts 
of green weight per acre:

From these data it may be seen that white Dutch clover 
was outyielded by only one variety, crimson. Yields would 
vary much more if harvest had been made under condi- 
tions similar to those of pasturing, rather than as for hay. 
The continuous biting or cutting off of the leaves causes 
white Dutch to stool more freely than the other varieties; 
this is a very important pasture plant characteristic, re- 
sulting in larger total yields when measured throughout 
the grazing season. 

Establishing white Dutch clover.* White Dutch clover 
should be sown after the grasses have been established. 
This prevents shading young grass plants, and the existing 
grass cover serves as a protection to the clover seedings. 
When sown on established grass sod, 3 to 5 pounds of seed 
are sufficient to give a good stand. This should be sown 
in the fall, by November 1. After seeding, it is well to 
run a spike-toothed harrow over the sod which shakes 
seed to the ground and the harrow tracks serve as lodging 
places for the small seed in case of excessive rainfall.

Hop Clover 

The hop clovers are winter annual clovers with small 
stems which branch from the base upward. The general 
type of growth is similar to that of the lespedezas. 

Two species of hop clover are found in Mississippi pas- 
tures, least hop (Trifolium dubium), by far the predomi- 
nating, and low hop (Trifolium procumbens). Low hop 



*Taken from Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 356, "Pastures 
in Mississippi," page 16, table 5, State College, Mississippi, July, 1941. 



86 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMEIST STATION BULLETIN No. 4)9 

grows larger and has a much larger seed head than least 
hop. The two look very much alike until they bloom. Low 
hop has yielded almost twice as much plant material per 
acre at the West Point Forage Crops Field as has least hop. 

The hop clovers are adapted to most of the soils of the 
State. Although they will grow on soil of a lower level 
of fertility than white Dutch clover, the use of phosphate 
will greatly increase their yield. This may be shown by 
results obtained from rates of phosphate application on 
low hop clover at the West Point field. 

Establishing hop clovers.* Planting dates and methods 
of seeding the hop clovers are the same as those for white 
Dutch. Clovers sown on land that has not previously 
grown clover should be inoculated. 

Where conditions of moisture and fertility are not favor- 
able to the growth of white Dutch clover, or where no fer- 
tilization is to be practiced under these conditions, the hop 
clovers will prove to be the more dependable spring* clover. 
However, under any system of improvement or on land of 
average improvement or on land of average fertility, white 
Dutch clover will prove to be more productive than hop 
clovers. 

The Lespedeza Species 

The annual species of lespedeza are the only summer 
legumes that are able to persist and furnish grazing in 
permanent pastures in Mississippi. 

Common (Lespedeza striata) is the best of the annual 
species for pasture. This superiority is due to, its high- 
er per acre yield and to the fact that it is the only species 
that will reseed itself consistently under grazing condi- 
tions. In spite of the high cost of seed at present, this 
species is preferred because of its reseeding ability. How- 
ever, the cost of seed will make it more economical to sow 
a lespedeza mixture containing only a small amount of 
common lespedeza and a large amount of some other spe- 
cies. After 2 or 3 years of grazing, common will be the 
only species remaining. In pastures or meadows, the nec-

in Mississippi," page 18, State College, Mississippi, July, 1941. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



87 



essity of reseeding other annual varieties every 2 or 3 
years will in only two seedings balance the difference in 
seed cost between the less costly lespedeza and common. 
The Tennessee 76 variety of common behaves in the same 
manner as does common and differences are difficult to dis- 
tinguish. 

The annual lespedezas are adapted to almost all the soil 
types of the State having a fair degree of fertility. Al- 
though lespedeza will respond to liming, Korean (Lespe- 
deza stipulacea) is the only variety that is dependable 
on the black soils of the *'Lime" or Prairie Belt, and only 
on this soil is Korean recommended over the other annual 
varieties. With the exception of this type of soil, the an- 
nual varieties show little preference for soil types of the 
State. 

The lespedezas are very palatable and nutritious and 
for this reason should be included in the pasture mixture. 
This may be seen by the protein content of the different 
varieties harvested at flowering, grown on three widely 
varying soil types. 

Establishing lespedeza.* The annual varieties of lespe- 
deza should be planted as soon after the first of February 
as possible, and certainly before March 15. By early sow- 
ing, the lespedeza plants are able to make sufficient root 
growth to carry them through the dry periods in the spring 
which are so often fatal to plantings made after March 15. 
Losses of early plants due to cold are more than offset by 
the early establishment of surviving plants. Regardless 
of whether sown on bottom or upland soils or for what 
use, lespedeza should be sown early in Mississippi. 

Considerable difficulty has been experienced in many 
sections of the state in holding lespedeza stands where 
fertility and moisture conditions are favorable for good 
growth of spring clovers, because the earlier growth of 
clover shades out the young lespedeza plants. Tests have 
shown that such growth kept 5 inches or less in height, 
whether by mowing or grazing, will insure lespedeza grow- 
th during the summer. Such a condition may be made ad- 
vantageous in several ways. Early mowing will eradicate

in Mississippi," pages 19 and 20, State College, Mississippi, July, 1941. 



88 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

several species of spring weeds, and clippings can be stack- 
ed for supplemental feeding during dry periods in the 
summer or for winter feeding of livestock. 

The annual varieties of lespedeza may be sown on sod 
without any soil preparation. It is advisable to run a spike- 
tooth harrow over the sod after seeding. This serves as 
needed preparation and provides a lodging place for seed 
in case of excessive rains. 

If use is to be made of the lespedeza crop the first year, 
relatively heavy seeding should be made. Sowing 25 
pounds per acre will result in a hay crop or good grazing 
the year seeded. If a volunteer crop is desired or the pas- 
ture is to be lightly grazed, 10 to 15 pounds of seed will 
be sufficient to produce a good stand the second year. 

Methods of Preparing Land for Carpet Grass 
and Lespedeza 

Conducted by: South Carolina Agricultural Experiment 
Station, Clemson. 

Conducted at: Coast Station, Summerville. 

Period: 1930-33. 

Purpose: To compare several methods of preparing cut- 
over coastal lands for carpet grass and lespedeza pastures. 

Land history: The land had been cleared approximately 
ten years before this experiment. It was not cropped but 
consisted of cut-over coastal lands converted into perma- 
nent pasture. 

Soil: Coxville sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: Three plots of one acre each 
were set out on an area which had a complete sod of broom 
sedge and other native grasses of little feed value, as well 
as a few low bush oaks and gallberry bushes. Freshly pre- 
pared land was used each year, and each year's work con- 
stituted a separate experiment. 

The three methods of preparing the land were as follows : 

Plot 1. Burned in late winter. 

Plot 2. Burned, disked with tractor tandem disk harrow, 
and harrowed with smoothing harrow. 

Plot 3. Burned, plowed, disked with tractor tandem disk 
harrow, and harrowed with smoothing harrow. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



89 



In late March after the rains had settled the soil on plots 
one and two into a fairly firm seedbed, all the plots were 
seeded broadcast to 10 pounds of carpet grass and 5 pounds 
of common lespedeza per acre, after which they were har- 
rowed with a smoothing or drag harrow. Stand counts 
were taken at numerous points in each plot in mid-sum- 
mer. 

Cattle were kept on the pastures continuously during the 
experiment, and the plots were closely grazed. 

The seasonal condition of the pastures during the ex- 
periments was average. 

Although an experiment in this series was conducted in 
1930 it was merely a preliminary study. For that reason 
it is not included here.

Comparison of Bermuda and Carpet Grass for

Land history: For the 10 years previous to 1930, pas- 
tures one and two had been used for annual grazing crops ; 
pearl millet was planted in the spring and a mixture of 
oats, rye, barley, and vetch in the fall. No fertilizer or 
manure was applied during this period. In February 1930, 
both of these pastures were plowed, and clumps of Bermu- 
da roots were scattered over the surface at intervals of 
about 3 feet and harrowed into the soil with a disk harrow. 
These pastures were used very little in 1930 because a dry 
season prevented the development of a good sod. In May 
1931, pastures one and two each received an application 
of 3,000 pounds of limestone per acre. They were grazed 
during 1931 and 1932 before the beginning of the experi- 
mental work in 1933. 

Pastures three and four were old established Bermuda 
grass sods which had previously been part of the regular 
pasture of a dairy herd. In November 1932, pasture three 
received an application of 3,000 pounds of limestone per 
acre. Pasture five had also been a part of the regular 
dairy pasture before being fenced in the fall of 1933. It 
had been seeded to carpet grass in 1925, and was, at the 
time of fencing and throughout the 2 years it was used 
for experimental grazing, a 90 to 95 percent pure stand 
of carpet grass. 

Soil: Pastures one to four were Cecil sandy clay loam; 
pasture five was Wehadkee sandy loam and was located 
on a low-lying, poorly drained, creek bottom. 

Procedure and conditions: The five areas used for these 
studies were designated as pastures one, two, three, four, 
and five. Pastures one, two, and three (Bermuda grass), 
were tested for the 3-year period, 1933-35. Pasture four 
(Bermuda grass) and pasture five (carpet grass) were 
tested during the 1934 and 1935 seasons. Each pasture 
was enclosed by a permanent fence of woven wire in order 
to maintain a definite net grazing area throughout the ex- 
periment. 

Pasture three had been used previously by the dairy herd 
as a night bedding ground and in the fall of 1932 had an 
accumulation of manure equivalent to about five tons per 
acre. This was evenly distributed and was the only treat- 
ment on the area in 1933. The area was not grazed from 
November 1932 until the pasture season began in April 
1933. 

Amounts of fertilizer and dates of application for pas- 
tures one, two, three, and five are given in table 44. Pas- 
ture four was not fertilized. All limestone and fertilizers 
were applied as surface treatments.

In early November of 1933 and 1934, each pasture was 
harrowed both ways with a heavily weighted spring-tooth 
harrow. 

Before grazing commenced each spring, wild onions were 
removed by digging with a light mattock. Other weeds 
such as dock, fennel, and certain thistles were cut by hand 
periodically during the growing season. 

Registered Holstein, Jersey, and Guernsey cows were us- 
ed in the experiments, but an attempt was made to main- 
tain at all time a balance between Holstein and Channel 
Island breeds in each pasture. The pasture groups were 
also kept as similar as possible in age, size, and producing 
ability. All cows were in moderate to heavy production, 
at least 6 weeks advanced in lactation yet early enough in 
lactation to be used throughout the season. Pastures were 
stocked at a minimum rate of one cow per acre, and ani- 
mals were added or removed as the condition of the pas- 
tures justified. When cows were added they were handled, 
prior to being placed on test, under the same conditions 
as the original cows. 

Liveweight variations for the season were kept within a 
maximum of 10 percent of the initial weight. 

Cows were milked three times per day throughout the 
experiment. They were weighed on three consecutive days 
at the beginning and end of each season, and weekly or bi- 
weekly during the balance of the period. Daily milk yields 
were recorded, and weekly composite milk samples were 
tested for butterfat. 

Barn feeding was at no time discontinued entirely, al- 
though the rate varied frequently. The rate of barn feed- 
ing was regulated to maintain the milk yield at an average 
decline of 2.5 percent per week, using the production for 
the first week on pasture as a basis. 

In 1933 the cows were on pasture continuously except 
during milking hours. In 1934 and 1935 they were kept 
in dry lots at night and grazed only during the day. They 
had access to salt, drinking water, and shade in each pas- 
ture. 

Rainfall at Clemson averaged 53.33 inches over a period 
of 45 years. It is usually evenly distributed throughout 
the year except during the months of October and No- 
vember. The growing period averages about 220 days. In 
1935, however, only 175 days elapsed between killing frosts.

PART VII 

MISCELLANEOUS 
Controlling Weeds and Brush 

The farmers and agricultural leaders contacted in mak- 
ing the pasture survey shown in Part II of this bulletin 
all agreed that controlling weeds and other undesirable pas- 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



93 



ture plants was one of the most important and profitable 
pasture practices they had observed or practiced. These 
people likewise agreed that the mowing machine was the 
most effective and practical means of controlling these 
plants. These statements are substantiated by the fact 
that 72 of the 86 farmers surveyed, mowed their pastures 
an average of 1.8 times per year as shown in table 6 on 
page 22. 

It is pointed out on page 41 of this bulletin that bush- 
es were satisfactorily controlled on one of the experiment 
station pastures at State College, Mississippi, by mowing 
the pasture twice per year. 

A discussion on mowing to control weeds and the value 
of same taken from Mississippi Agricultural Experiment 
Station Bulletin 356, "Pastures in Mississippi," is given be- 
low, also table from the same reference showing the pro- 
duction of seed by different weeds and the effect of mow- 
ing on the yield and composition of pasture material. 

Mowing to Control Weeds" 

Timely mowing is one of the most important pasture im- 
provement or management practices that Mississippi farm- 
ers can follow. 

This is especially true on soils of a medium or low ferti- 
lity, even when seedings of desirable plants have been made 
and satisfactory stand obtained. The desirable plants are 
in competition with the undesirable plants for soil moisture 
and plant food. The undesirable plants, as the weeds and 
sedges common to Mississippi, are able to grow on soils of 
a lower level of fertility than are the grasses and legumes 
used for pasture. Usually taller in growth, they tend to 
shade out the desirable low-grazing plants. They are un- 
palatable to livestock and are thus allowed by grazing ani- 
mals to grow and produce seed unhindered, while the de- 
sirable plants are grazed and their seed production is great- 
ly reduced.

in Mississippi," pages 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27, tables 13 and 14, State College, 
Mississippi, July, 1941.

Seed Produced by Common Weeds 

The number of seed produced by the common weeds is 
surprisingly large. Averages of seed counts made on sev- 
eral species of weeds common to Mississippi pastures are 
shown in table 45. When it is realized that a single bitter- 
weed plant may produce 3,102 seed, and a single daisy flea- 
bane plant produced 22,785 seed — it is easy to understand 
why weeds unhindered **take" a pasture. 

With uneven grazing or the lack of mowing permitting 
weeds to make these average numbers of seed per plant, 
pasture plants will gradually give way to the weeds. 

Table 45 below shows how undesirable plants will spread 
if allowed to seed.

The value of mowing for the control of weeds is empha- 
sized by data obtained in a mowing test conducted at the 
Central Station, State College, Mississippi. 

Used in this test was an established permanent pasture 
on Houston soil. Grazing was made up principally of Dal- 
lis and Bermuda grasses, and hop and white Dutch clovers. 
Portions of the pasture were left unmowed for comparison 
with the mowed area. No other treatment was employed. 

Palatability Improved by Mowing 

Representative areas of both mowed and unmowed areas 
were protected from grazing by means of movable cages,, 
and total yields were obtained by harvesting the growth at 
frequent intervals so as to duplicate as far as possible the 
conditions of grazing. Unprotected areas of the same size, 
mowed and unmowed, and representative of the growth by 
grazing cattle, were harvested at the same time. The dif- 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



95 



ference between the yields of the protected and the unpro- 
tected areas represents the quantity of pasture growth that 
w^as eaten by grazing cattle. The 3-year average yields 
are reported as dry matter per acre in table 46.

Several very significant and important results are shown 
in this table. Most significant is the fact that the cattle 
left two and one-half times the amount of herbage pro- 
duced on the unmowed plots as was left on the mowed 
plots. This was due to the presence of weeds and unpalat- 
able plants on the unmowed areas. The tall undesirable 
plants — daisy fleabane and mayweed during the spring, 
and ragweed during the summer — growing in combination 
with the clovers and grasses, caused the unmowed areas 
to yield slightly more plant material per acre. The aver- 
age difference in yield was 334 pounds of dry material or 
8.2 percent in favor of the unmowed plots. 

The yields of plant material do not tell the full story of 
pasture production, however. The one purpose of pasture 
forage production is that it be eaten by livestock. In this 
test, the cattle grazed 79.7 percent or 3,230 pounds of for- 
age per acre on the mowed area ; and the cattle grazed only 
49.8 percent or 2,195 pounds of forage on the unmowed 
area. Thus, although slightly more forage was produced 
on the unmowed area, the grazing animals secured actually 
about 50 percent more feed from the mowed area. 

Protein Increased by Mowing 

Quality of production must also be considered. The low- 
er crude protein content of the herbage produced on the 
unmowed areas over-balanced the slightly greater yield of 
plant material per acre. Producing an average of 4,386.6 
pounds of dry material per acre of a 6.92 percent crude pro- 
tein content means an acre production of 304.4 pounds of 



9 6 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

crude protein from the unmowed area. The mowed area 
had a seasonal average of 11.76 percent protein, which 
equals 476.6 pounds of crude protein per acre. This is a 
difference of 172 pounds of crude protein in favor of mow- 
ing, and the difference is equivalent to the amount contain- 
ed in 422 pounds of 41 percent cottonseed meal. Timely 
mowing prevents the production of weed seed. By elimi- 
nating the uneven competition due to selective grazing and 
by consequent reduction of the weed population, improves 
the quality of pasture production. 

Timely mowing is not just mowing, and weeds cannot 
be controlled by mowing after they have seeded. Mowing 
after seed have matured serves as reseeding rather than 
as control. 

Time of Mowing Important 

Bitterweed and mayweed should be mowed when blos- 
soms have started forming rather than after they begin to 
bloom, for at this stage the seed are capable of germinat- 
ing. Other annual weeds should be mowed when flower- 
ing begins. It is necessary to mow perennial weeds for 
2 or 3 years, as they produce underground plant parts, by 
means of which they live from year to year. If these 
storage parts are not dug, the above-ground portion must 
be kept mowed until all storage material in the under- 
ground parts is used in initiating new growth. 

Other than improving the quality of production by weed 
control, mowing improves the quality of desirable pasture 
plants. The crude protein content of Dallis or Bermuda 
grass can be increased by mowing, so that the seed stalks 
and fibrous growth are soon replaced by leaf growth. 

The harvested material from a pure stand of Dallis grass 
when in the seeding stage analyzed 6.9 percent crude pro- 
tein. Two weeks later the material harvested from the 
same area contained 18.74 percent. A pure stand of Ber- 
muda grass handled in the same manner produced, in the 
seeding stage, material containing 7.1 percent crude pro- 
tein while material harvested 2 weeks later was of a 19.08 
percent crude protein content. In both these instances the 
protein content of desirable pasture grasses was more than 
doubled by mowing.

Controlling Fire in Pastures 

Conducted by: Oklahoma Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Guthrie, Oklahoma. 
Period: 1932-1940. 

Purpose: To determine the effect of burning grazed and 
ungrazed pasture on the yield of hay and also the survival 
of various plants. 

Procedure and conditions: In 1932, 110 acres of land, ly- 
ing just east of the main farm of the Red Plains Conserva- 
tion Experiment Station farm at Guthrie was leased for 
experimental purposes. Part of this land was in native 
grass and scrub oak. The remainder, which had been 
abandoned from cultivation, was used from 1932 to 1938 
for various kinds of plant cover studies. In 1939 and 1940 
the whole 110 acres was used for experimental grazing. 

Beginning in 1932, a fire guard 40 feet wide was burned 
along the property lines and roadsides each fall as soon as 
there was danger from unrestricted burning. In 1939 and 
1940, another area which had been protected from grazing 
since 1930, was burned in the fall for experimental pur- 
poses. Thus, there were six different conditions available 
for study. A comparison of the amount of grass produced 
on the fire guards which were fall burned 8 years was made 
with that on the protected pasture under both grazed and 
ungrazed conditions. Another comparison of the grass on 
virgin land which was burned in the fall 2 years was made 
with that from an area that had been protected from both 
fire and grazing 11 years. 

Composite samples of the native grass from areas of 
equal size on each of the six locations were collected in 
October 1930, and weighed. The results are given in table 
47.

In a careful examination of the vegetation on the un- 
burned as compared to the burned areas, perennial plants 
were found to predominate on the unburned land, while the 
plant cover where burning had occurred consisted largely 
of annuals. Apparently this condition had developed be- 
cause the fire destroyed the seed of the perennial grasses 
and the old parent plants had died.

PART VIII 

SUPPLEMENTAL PASTURE 

Year-around grazing is probably the aspiration of every 
livestock farmer. The average length of the grazing sea- 
son on permanent pastures in Mississippi is probably about 
5 to 6 months. This condition indicates that one of the 
critical problems confronting livestock farmers in Missis- 
sippi is to find, if possible, economical ways of extending 
grazing over the rest of the year. To do this will mean 
that grazing must be provided for the dry late summer 
and early fall and for winter and early spring. 

Milk receipts from various milk plants in Mississippi 
show that milk production increases approximately 100 per- 
cent during the spring and early summer seasons. It is 
also recognized that most of the beef gains on pasture are 
made during the same seasons in Mississippi. It seems 
important, therefore, that farmers provide, if economi- 
cally possible, green grazing during the critical periods 
mentioned above in order that high milk production and 
beef gains be continued throughout the year. Such graz- 
ing would greatly reduce the usual cost of feeding during 
such periods. 

• In recent years certain farmers in Mississippi have tried 
out various means of extending the grazing season on their 
farms. Likewise, the Mississippi Experiment Station has 
conducted experiments along this line. Some of the other 
states have done considerable experimenting with supple- 
mental grazing crops.

The results of some of these farmer experience and ex- 
periment station tests are given on the following pages of 
this bulletin. These results appear in this order: 

Mississippi Farmer experiences. 

Experiment Station results. 

Rates and dates of seeding supplemental grazing crops. 

Mississippi Farmer Experiences 

Northeast Mississippi Area. In this area barley and oats 
with crimson clover have provided excellent grazing during 
the fall and winter season. Of course, many other similar 
cases may be cited in this area. It is recommended that 
these crops be sown early, probably August 15 to Septem- 
ber 15, if early fall grazing is to be secured. After the 
oat crop is harvested, either for grain or as a grazing crop 
it might be followed by Sudan grass or some other crop 
for supplemental summer grazing. 

Rye grass, crimson clover, white Dutch clover, and Per- 
sian clover have been planted and gave good results in 
this area. These crops may be planted either on the per- 
manent pasture land or on crop land, whichever is desir- 
able. At any rate these crops afford good winter and early 
spring grazing and in some cases, as with white Dutch 
clover, grazing may be had throughout the spring and into 
the summer months. 

Kudzu and lespedeza sericea have provided excellent 
grazing in this area during dry summer and fall months 
and are usually planted on critical slopes not suitable for 
cultivation or permanent pasture. 

Summarizing, it seems that practically year-around suc- 
culent grazing might be obtained in this area by the use 
of the crops mentioned above, along with good permanent 
pasture, if the grazing program is properly planned in ad- 
vance so that the crops might be planted at the proper 
time and on the soil best adapted to each plant. 

Brown Loam Area. Kudzu and lespedeza sericea have 
provided temporary grazing during the dry summer and 
early fall seasons in this Area. Of course, it is recognized 



100 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

that it is more difficult to establish these crops than some 
other crops. However, they can be established on rather 
steep slopes and possibly badly eroded soils that might 
not be used otherwise economically, as well as on the bet- 
ter soils. 

Oats and crimson clover have given good fall and winter 
grazing in this Area. When these crops are planted in 
early September or late in August, grazing has begun as 
early as October and continued until April 30. Crimson 
clover is sometimes planted alone and seems to thrive bet- 
ter on the higher soils in this Area, while wild winter 
peas can be planted on the lower or wet soils. 

Some farmers follow the practice of planting lespedeza 
with oats; lespedeza does not afford any winter grazing 
but does afford grazing in the spring, summer and early 
fall if sufficient moisture is available. In some cases it is 
cut for hay. 

Wild winter peas have given excellent results as a winter 
grazing crop in this Area. This crop affords late winter 
and early spring grazing, as do white Dutch clover and 
bur clover. These three crops may be grown either in the 
permanent pasture or as supplemental crops on crop land 
and in the latter case, they can be allowed to reseed or a 
crop of seed may be harvested. For seed to be produced, 
however, it is necessary to discontinue grazing during the 
seeding period. Wild winter peas are toxic to livestock 
during the seeding period. 

South Mississippi Area. For the spring and summer 
grazing, kudzu and lespedeza sericea have been grown very 
successfully in some sections of this Area and in many cases 
they have been grazed temporarily; controlled grazing 
seems to be necessary, especially with kudzu. Kudzu has 
been grazed as early as May 15 and sericea as early as 
April 1. Alyce clover has also been grown successfully 
in this Area and can usually be grown on any good cotton 
soil; it is a warm weather plant. Lespedeza (usually com- 
mon lespedeza) has also been grown successfully in South 
Mississippi and used as a temporary grazing crop. This 
crop usually grows well on practically all soils. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



101 



For fall and winter grazing, oats and vetch have been 
grown successfully throughout the Area ; also crimson clov- 
er and wild winter peas have been grown in a few cases 
on the better soils and used for supplemental grazing. 
Rye grass has also been used as a supplemental grazing 
crop. Lespedeza is very commonly grown for fall grazing. 
It is necessary, in nearly all cases, that these fall and win- 
ter crops be reseeded annually, whereas, some of the spring 
and summer crops such as kudzu and sericea are perennials. 
Another advantage of growing such crops as kudzu and 
sericea is that they may be grown on critical slopes not 
suitable for growing other crops or permanent pasture. 
Also, if they are not used for grazing, they can be cut 
for hay which is good in quality if cut at the proper stage 
and properly cured. They provide excellent grazing insur- 
ance in event the summer and early fall seasons are excep- 
tionally dry and the permanent pasture becomes short or 
plays out. 

In many cases in South Mississippi, oats are planted and 
used not only as a temporary grazing crop during the win- 
ter and early spring but are harvested for grain as well. 
Where they are harvested for grain, grazing is usually 
discontinued prior to April 1. 

In some cases, either rye grass, lespedeza or crimson 
clover are planted in combination with oats and after the 
oats are either harvested for grain or grazed off, the les- 
pedeza can still be used throughout the summer and early 
fall as a temporary grazing crop or may be cut for hay. 

Thus, in summarizing, the following supplemental crops 
are grown in South Mississippi, by seasons: 

Spring, summer and early fall: Kudzu, lespedeza ser- 
icea, Alyce clover, and lespedeza. 

Late fall, winter and early spring: Oats, vetch, rye- 
grass, wild winter peas, and crimson clover. 

It is necessary that these crops be planted according to 
the need on individual farms and on the soils to which 
each crop is best adapted. Some of these crops are plant- 
ed particularly for the purpose of conserving soil, grazing 
being more or less incidental. This is particularly true of 
kudzu and lespedeza sericea which are often planted, as 



102 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

mentioned above, on critical slopes and left on the land 
permanently. 

Prairie Area. This Area is probably adapted to a wider 
variety of plants than most of the other soil areas in Mis- 
sissippi, but variations within the area are such that they 
should probably be discussed in more detail as to their adap- 
tation to soil types. 

On soils of high lime content, such as Sumpter, Johnson 
grass and sweet clover are grown as supplemental grazing 
crops. With additional aids such as fertilizer application 
and special preparation, wild winter peas, alfalfa, and 
crimson clover are grown. Of course, Johnson grass and 
alfalfa would provide supplemental grazing in summer, 
while wild winter peas, crimson clover, and sweet clover 
would provide late winter and early spring grazing. 

On terrace soils, from neutral to high lime content, John- 
son grass, sweet clover, wild winter peas, Persian and 
Lappacia clover, vetch and Korean lespedeza are grown; 
and with special aid, such as fertilizer application, and spe- 
cial preparation, alfalfa and crimson clover are grown. 

On bottom soils of high lime content, such as Catalpa, 
Trinity, and Leeper, Johnson grass, wild winter peas, Per- 
sian clover, crimson clover, and vetch are grown on soils 
having good drainage. 

On soils, usually acid, such as Kaufman, Una, Oktibbeha, 
Eutaw, Kipling, Geiger and Crockett, crimson clover, wild 
winter peas, and Persian clover may be grown as supple- 
mental grazing crops. 

Thus in summarizing, it might be said that some green 
grazing has been provided in all the four areas mentioned 
above during every month in the year, even though some 
weeks there was very little if any grazing. Nevertheless, 
farmers have said that this supplemental grazing has re- 
duced the cost of milk production and the maintenance of 
livestock. 

In this study some observations were made as to the 
kind of soils on which these crops were grown. Small 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



103 



grains, crimson clover, bur clover, Austrian peas, and the 
vetches seemed to thrive best on well drained soils with 
medium to high fertility. Lespedeza did best on acid soils, 
and crimson clover was found growing on acid soils but 
seemed to do better on neutral and lime soils. Wild winter 
peas were found to thrive on extremely moist or wet soils. 
In fact, they did well on soils so wet that most other leg- 
umes failed to grow. White Dutch clover did best on moist 
fertile soils. 

Grazing Johnson Grass and Wild Winter Peas 

In figure 8, cows are shown grazing wild winter peas on 
W. A. Swoope's farm, Columbus, Mississippi. 

This pasture is on Catalpa soil. 

Cows were grazed intermittently from June 1 to Septem- 
ber 30, 1942, on Johnson grass and wild winter pea residue ; 
from November 1, 1942 to January 7, 1943, on wild winter 
peas; also from February 10 to March 1, 1943, on wild 
winter peas. No fertilizer was used on the crops. 

During the three grazing periods shown above, this 84- 
acre pasture provided a total of 40,650 cow-days grazing 
or an average of 484 cow-days grazing per acre.

Wild Winter Peas as Supplemental Pasture, 
Lowndes County, Mississippi 

The picture below shows a part of a 45-acre pasture own- 
ed by C. H. Reeves, Columbus, Mississippi. The predomi- 
nate plant shown in the picture is wild winter peas in full 
bloom. The picture was taken on May 14, 1942. Natural- 
ly, these peas are not as high as they would be normally 
due to the fact that they had been grazed heavily. 

The soil types are Sumpter, Catalpa, Houston, and Hunt. 

Wild winter peas were planted on a 10 to 12-year-old 
sod of Bermuda, Dallis and Johnson grass for the purpose 
of providing grazing as well as seed production. 

Sixty-one head of cows were kept on the 45 acres from 
November 1 to March 15, 1942 and were sold on March 15 
for 15 cents per pound. The principal part of the grazing 
during this period was from the peas. The only additional 
feed given was hay cut from the same field or pasture 
and the maximum amount fed was 8 bales per day to the 
entire herd. In addition, $3,300.00 worth of wild winter 
pea seed were harvested and sold from this field after 
grazing was discontinued March 15, 1942.

Grazing Lespedeza Sericea 

The photograph below shows dairy cattle grazing on a 
field of lespedeza sericea on A. D. Kelly's farm, Mashula- 
ville, Mississippi. 

Mr. Kelly grazed 17 cows and 5 to 7 head of horses ex- 
clusively on this 11-acre field from May 1 to November 15, 
1943. It is Wilcox soil, intermediate between Lufkin and 
Oktibbeha. The soil is in the Flatwood Area of Noxubee 
County and 5 years ago it was idle broom sedge land. 

The season was exceptionally dry in 1943 in this area 
and Mr. Kelly was forced to graze his sericea field or sell 
the majority of his cows. He stated that his cows held up 
well in milk production in spite of the fact that he had to 
drive them over a mile each day so that they might get 
drinking water. He also stated that there was nothing 
else growing in the field except sericea and that he had 
no trouble getting the cattle to eat the sericea, either as a 
hay or pasture crop. This field usually produces about 2 
tons of hay per acre and is grazed in the fall, but in 1943 
it was necessary, as already mentioned, to graze the field 
continuously from May 1 to November 15. 

No fertilizer was used on this field.

Experiment Station Results 

Kudzu as a Temporary Grazing Crop 

Conducted by: Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Natchez, Mississippi. 
Period: 1940-43. 

Purpose: To control erosion and provide temporary graz- 
ing for livestock. 

Soil: Steep, badly eroded brown loam hill land. 

Procedure and conditions: A 7-acre paddock was set to 
kudzu in March, 1940, on badly eroded land. 

In October 1942, just before frost, II/2 tons of hay per 
acre were harvested. In January 1943, the land was disk- 
ed three times with a disk harrow which resulted in a 
thicker stand and a higher quality hay the following grow- 
ing season. The summer of 1943, however, proved to be 
very dry in this section and pastures reached a dangerously 
low state of production. To help offset this lack of pas- 
turage, on June 4, 31 head of cattle consisting of 23 cows, 
7 calves and 1 bull were turned in on the 7-acre paddock 
of kudzu. No record was kept on the weight or gains of 
the bull. 

Grazing results from this 7-acre paddock are shown in 
table 48.

Annual Winter Pasture For Beef Production 

Conducted by: Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Sta- 
tion. 

Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: Winter 1939 and 1940. 

Purpose: To compare different winter grazing crops. 

Procedure and conditions: The winter temporary pas- 
ture crops were seeded as nearly as possible around Octo- 
ber 15 following the summer annual pastures. Oats and 
rye were planted at the rate of 4 bushels per acre, hairy 
vetch 30 pounds, and ryegrass 50 pounds per acre. 

Good grade yearling Hereford were used in this test. 
The animals were kept on and taken from the annual 
winter pastures as needed to make the most effective use 
of the crops. A mineral mixture composed of equal parts 
of salt, steamed bonemeal, and marble dust was kept be- 
fore the cattle. 

Table 49 shows the results of this test.

Pasturing Beef Cattle on Johnson Grass During the 
Winter Season 1939-1940, Alabama 

Conducted by : Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Marion Junction, Alabama. 
Period: 1939-1940. 

Purpose: (1) To determine the efficiency of matured and 
frosted Johnson grass when allowed to remain in the field 
to be grazed. (2) To determine the carrying capacity per 
acre of the Johnson grass when the entire production is 
utilized for wintering cattle. 

Soil: Sumpter and Houston. 

Procedure and conditions: An 80-acre field of Johnson 
grass was used in the trial. This field had already furnish- 
ed early spring grazing on clovers followed by a cutting of 
Johnson grass hay in the summer. The first cutting of 
hay was stacked in the field, a fence put around the stacks, 
and the grass allowed to grow without cutting for the rest 
of the season. The beef breeding herd of 83 cows and 
30 fall calves was turned on this field on November 15, 
1939. At that time, the Johnson grass, which had been 
frosted, was largely headed out and ranged from waist to 
shoulder high. The cattle were allowed to graze the frost- 
ed grass until it was cleared up, after which the stacked 
hay was fed over the fence. Each cow received an average 
of 2.23 pounds of cottonseed meal per head daily as a sup- 
plement to the grass and hay. The results of the trial are 
given in table 50. 

The carrying capacity period of 106 days for the 83 cows 
and 30 calves on 80 acres is to be compared with a re- 
quired wintering period of 109 days (average for the pre- 
vious 3 years). In carrying this herd for 106 days or from 
November 15 to March 1, the field furnished all the rough- 
age needed.

Fields No. 1 and 2. In this program fields No. 1 and No. 
2 are planted in oats and in barley to provide winter graz- 
ing and to produce grain for winter feeding. If preferred, 
field No. 2 may be planted to oats instead of barley. The 
best drained soils are used for small grain production. At 
this Substation, Sumpter soils (eroded whitish or greyish 
hill tops underlaid with Selma chalk) produce relatively 
higher yields of small grain than other soil types. 

In addition to furnishing winter grazing and producing 
grain for winter feeding, these fields also produce Johnson 
grass, which comes as a volunteer crop following harvest 
of the small grains. The Johnson grass is used for supple- 
mentary grazing or for hay as needed. 

Field No. 3. Field No. 3 is planted to wild winter peas, 
which are used for winter and early spring pasture. The 
Johnson grass following the wild winter peas is cut for hay 
or is used as supplementary grazing. Wild winter peas 
make their best growth on bottomlands that are too wet 
throughout the winter for small grains or other legumes. 

Field No. 4. Field No. 4 is in a clover-grass permanent 
pasture, consisting of black medic, and white Dutch clov- 
ers, and Dallis grass. This pasture is grazed as long as it 
will supply nutritious green feed. When grazing on this 
permanent pasture is reduced because of drought or frost, 
fields Nos. 1, 2, and 3, are used for supplementary grazing 
and to supply required hay. 

Fertilizer applications. Fields No. 1 and No. 2 are ferti- 
lized with 200 pounds of superphosphate or 400 pounds of 
basic slag per acre at grain-planting time. About March 
1 the small grains are top-dressed with 100 to 200 pounds 
of nitrate of soda. 



110 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

In the fall 400 pounds of superphosphate or 800 pounds 
of basic slag, and 50 to 100 pounds of muriate of potash 
per acre are applied to fields No. 3 and No. 4. 

Reference: Leaflet, May 1944, by K. G. Baker, Supt., 
Black Belt Substation, Marion Junction, Alabama, ''Crop 
Program for Production of Grade 'A' and Process Milk on 
the Lime Soils of the Black Belt." 

The above information shows the permanent and supple- 
mental pasture cropping and grazing program followed by 
the Agricultural Experiment Station, Marion Junction, Ala- 
bama. 

No records are kept as to the results obtained by fields 
or from each crop, however, this procedure has given the 
most practical results over a period of years in that less 
feeding is necessary, especially grain feeding, than any 
system of management used. In fact, no roughage is fed 
and most of the grain fed is produced from the grains 
planted in this rotation or on the 4-3/4 acres allotted to 
each animal unit. 

Comparison of Temporary Grazing Crops for 
Beef Steers 

Conducted by: Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1933-1938. 

Purpose: To .determine the effect of grazing various 
temporary pastures on the weight of cattle. 

Procedure and conditions: Work on temporary pastures 
was begun at Tifton, Georgia, in 1933 and included kudzu, 
cattail millet, Otootan soybeans, common lespedeza and 
velvetbeans. Results of pasturing kudzu are available for 
the 6 years, 1933-38, and for the other crops for the 4 
years, 1935-38. The kudzu pasture was used continuously 
during the summer season (from about May 1 until No- 
vember 1 for the 6 years). The other crops (except lespe- 
deza) were planted each spring. Lespedeza was scattered 
broadcast over the oats in the spring and thereafter came 
up voluntarily in the oats stubble. Cattail millet was pre- 
ceded each winter by a combination of oats and hairy 
vetch; Otootan soybeans by Abruzzi rye or by ryegrass; 
common lespedeza by oats ; and velvetbeans by Abruzzi rye. 
The summer crops, except lespedeza, were planted in rows 
and cultivated as much as was thought sufficient. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



111 



No fertilizers were used on any of the temporary pas- 
tures. 

Steers only were used on the kudzu pasture. Good grade 
Hereford steers and heifers were used on the other tem- 
porary grazing crops. A mineral composed of equal parts 
of salt, bonemeal, and ground limestone was kept before 
the animals at all times. With the kudzu and lespedeza 
excepted, the pastures were divided into two parts and each 
part alternately grazed for 3 or 4 weeks. Animals were 
put on and taken off pastures when considered advisable. 

Results of this grazing test are shown in table 51.

Grazing Kudzu Continuously 
Conducted by: Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1933-40. 

Purpose: To determine the value of kudzu as a crop for 
continuous grazing. 

Soil: Norfolk and Tifton sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: Kudzu is usually considered a 
temporary pasture upon which grazing is practiced heavily 
for short periods v^ith intervening periods of rest for re- 
vival of grov^th allov^ed. On this test, however, the cattle 
were put on in the spring and grazing continued all sum- 
mer. The purpose was to determine the carrying capacity 
and yield, and also to see if grazing could be practiced with- 
out interruption throughout the season. 



112 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 



Kudzu seed were planted at the rate of V/o pounds per 
acre in 4-foot rows on March 12, 1931. The following May 
drought damaged the stand so much that transplanting 
with crowns had to be done the next winter. About one 
gallon of stable manure was placed around each plant to 
hasten growth and establishment. The field was cultivated 
the first year and part of the second year. The pasture 
was not well enough established to start grazing until the 
spring of 1933. 

Later data indicate that crowns are more desirable than 
seed for establishing kudzu in the field because the crowns 
grow off faster and a more uniform stand is secured. 

By the end of 1935, or 5 years after starting, the kudzu 
appeared to be losing vigor. During the last week in Feb- 
ruary, 1936, two tons of stable manure were broadcast per 
acre, and the land turned deep with a two-horse plow. The 
turning of the pasture covered the manure, loosened the 
soil, and reset the kudzu plants. The result was a good 
stand and renewed growth vigor in 1936. It appears neces- 
sary to follow this practice about every 5 years. 

In the fall of 1934, caterpillars destroyed kudzu leaves, 
and the animals had to be removed on October 16, which 
was responsible for the low gain in liveweight per acre for 
that year as shown in table 52.

Oats Followed by Common Lespedeza for 
Temporary Pasture 

Conducted by: Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1932-40. 

Purpose: To determine the value of a combination winter 
and summer crop pasture in beef production. 

Soil: Norfolk and Tifton sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: The combination temporary 
pasture consisted of oats planted in November for late 
winter grazing followed by common lespedeza for summer 
grazing. The combination was started by planting 4 bush- 
els of oats per acre in the fall. Oats were grazed in the 
spring, and about March 1 common lespedeza (20 pounds 
per acre) was seeded at a heavy rate in order to get earlier 
grazing than could be had by light seeding. Oats give best 
results when seeded in early October, but it has been nec- 
essary to delay plowing until about November 1 to 10 so 
that lespedeza seed can mature and volunteer the follow- 
ing spring. It is hardly possible to graze oats right on to 
the time lespedeza is ready because oats are grazed out 
about June 1 and lespedeza is not large enough to give much 
grazing before July 1 on upland soils where moisture is 
limited. 

By having two crops each year on the same land the 
total gain per acre was 208.9 pounds over a 7-year aver- 
age, or the sum of gains on both oats and lespedeza. No 
grazing test was conducted on oats in 1935, due to a shift 
of pastures. No fertilizer was used on oats or lespedeza. 
This test has been conducted on soil too dry for best les- 
pedeza growth. Table 53 gives results of grazing on oats, 
and table 54 gives results on lespedeza. 

The above practice has suggested modifications that are 
worth consideration where these two crops are grown for 
maximum yields. 

In other field tests it has been definitely shown that 
phosphate fertilizer is decidedly beneficial to both oats and 
lespedeza, therefore, applications of around 300 pounds of 
superphosphate, or equivalent, per acre in the fall preced- 
ing the planting of oats should prove worth while. Under 
actual practice many farmers prefer to turn the land and 
plant oats about October 1, disregarding reseeding of lespe- 
deza. This practice, although a little more expensive, al- 
lows the oats to be planted on time. The lespedeza seed, 
25 to 30 pounds per acre, are sown on the young oats every 
spring about March 1. This insures a good crop of lespe- 



114 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 



deza which is not always had when reliance is placed on 
volunteer reseeding. Where this practice is followed, Kobe 
lespedeza can be used instead of common lespedeza, if de- 
sired.

Comparison of Various Winter Crops for 
Temporary Pastures 

Conducted by: Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station. 

Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 

Period: 1932-40 (presumably). 

Purpose: To compare beef gains per acre from various 
v^inter temporary crops. 

Soil: Norfolk and Tifton sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: This test was conducted on 6- 
acre plots. The crops were planted broadcast but were not 
fertilized. The winter temporary pastures include (1) oats 
and hairy vetch, (2) oats-lespedeza rotation, (3) Abruzzi 
rye, and (4) Italian ryegrass. Winter temporary pastures 
are important not only in the gains per acre in beef that 
they furnish, but in the carrying of cattle during months 
when they would otherwise have to be fed from the barn. 

Table 55 gives average number of steers carried on 6- 
acre pastures, also the average dates the animals were 
placed on and taken off these pastures, and the average 
gain in beef per acre. It will be noted that oats and hairy 
vetch gave an average liveweight gain of 135 pounds per 
acre, and that the grazing period was from February 1 to 
May 5, or during a time when feed is generally at premium. 

Oats alone gave liveweight gain of 107 pounds per acre, 
Abruzzi rye 85 pounds and Italian ryegrass 50 pounds per 
acre.

Comparison of Various Summer Crops for 
Temporary Pastures 

Conducted by: Georgia Agricultural Experiment Station. 

Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 

Period: 1932-40. 

Purpose: To compare grazing results with steers on les- 
pedeza, Otootan soybeans, and velvetbeans. 

Soil: Norfolk and Tifton sandy loam. 

Procedure and conditions: Otootan soybeans, although 
not the highest beef producer, improved the soil for the fol- 
lowing crops. Soybeans were an excellent temporary pas- 
ture and one reason why the beef yield was not greater 
was because of occasional late summer attacks by cater- 
pillars. Thirty pounds of seed were planted per acre in 
21/2-foot rows. 

None of the temporary pasture was fertilized. The pas- 
tures, with the exception of lespedeza which was broadcast, 
were planted in 21/2-foot rows and cultivated two or three 
times and divided by a cross fence, and alternate or rota^ 
tion grazing practiced. This allowed one-half of the pas- 
ture to rest and produce growth while the other was being 
grazed. 

There were 6 acres in each plot.

Annual Summer Pasture for Beef Production 
Conducted by : Georgia Coastal Plain Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Tifton, Georgia. 
Period: 1935-1939. 

Purpose: To compare annual summer crops for beef pro- 
duction. 

Procedure and conditions: In this test summer and winter 
temporary pastures were grown in rotation on the same 
land, giving two crops per year. The rotation is arranged 
as nearly as possible where a legume follows a non-legume 
crop. No fertilizer was used on any of the crops. All the 
summer crops were planted in rows and cultivated with the 
exception of common lespedeza which is sown broadcast on 
young oats. 

Good grade yearling Hereford steers and heifers were 
used in this test in 1939. A mineral mixture was kept be- 
fore the animals at all times. The results of this 5-year 
test are shown in table 57.

Kudzu Versus Native Grass as Pasture Plants for 
Dairy Cattle 

Conducted by: Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Auburn, Alabama. 

Period: Summer of 1934. June 1 through remainder of 
pasture season. 



118 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

Purpose: To determine the carrying capacity of kuduz, 
and the relative effects of kudzu versus native grass pas- 
ture on the production of milk and butterfat and on the 
color and flavor of milk. 

Procedure and conditions: Four Jersey cows of as nearly 
uniform age and productive capacity as possible were used 
in the test. All cows were fed concentrates at the ration 
of 1 pound daily for each 21/2 pounds of milk produced. 
Two cows were grazed on a luxuriant growth of kudzu and 
two cows were given the run of pasture consisting of les- 
pedeza, Bermuda, carpet, Dallis and other native grasses. 
At the end of each 28-day period the cows were changed 
from kudzu to grass and vice versa. To determine the 
carrying capacity of kudzu, one cow was given the run of 
an acre of kudzu and another was grazed on a half acre. 
The effect on production is given in table 58.

Grazing Beef Cattle on Kudzu in Alabama 
Conducted by: Alabama Agricultural Experiment Station. 
Conducted at: Auburn, Alabama. 
Period: 1934-35. 

Purpose: To show the effect of grazing kudzu on the 
weight of beef cows and on the stand of kudzu. 

Procedure and conditions: Four acres of established kud- 
zu on Station Farm were divided into five plots and grazed 
at various rates with beef cows and heifers in the summer 
of 1934 and 1935. 

As a means of determining the extent to which kudzu 
will stand grazing, the 4 acres have been grazed as one 
field since 1935. It was usually grazed with dry cows and 
2-year-old heifers from June to August or September. The

average grazing period was 68 days, and animal units per 
acre 1.25. The kudzu was able to survive and make a good 
growth. Grazing results are shown in table 59.

then discontinued. The sow and suckling pigs were on the 
pasture 30 days, and the four shotes, 60 days. 1938: On 
May 11, five pigs and three shotes started grazing on one 
acre of kudzu and were on pasture 70 days. They received 
no supplementary feed. Results of this test are shown in 
table 60.

Rates and Dates of Seeding Supplemental 
Grazing Crops 

It is generally accepted that the crops discussed in this 
section of the bulletin should be seeded at heavier rates 
when planted for supplemental grazing than when planted 
for grain or harvested crops. However, with high seed 
prices, as they are at the present time, there is a question 
as to what the most economical rate of seeding might be. 
Of course, the prices of the livestock products would be a 
determining factor as well as available finances for pur- 
chasing seed. Most of the experiment station tests with 
these crops on rates of seeding have been conducted where 
they were planted as crops to be harvested rather than 
for grazing crops. 

Likewise, very little experimental data are available on 
dates of seeding supplemental grazing crops in Mississippi, 
though it is generally accepted that fall and winter graz- 
ing crops should be planted as soon as weather and moisture 
conditions will permit and land is available in order to get 
the maximum length fall and winter grazing season. Gen- 
eral observation and experience has shown that, unless fall 
and winter grazing crops are planted early there is quite a 
period between the time summer grazing plays out in per- 
manent pastures and the time when grazing can be had 
from fall and winter crops. 

Considering all these factors, the Mississippi Agricultur- 
al Experiment Station makes the following general recom- 
mendations below in table 61 as to rates and dates of seed- 
ing supplemental grazing crops discussed in this bulletin.

APPENDIX 

The Delta Area of Mississippi was not included in the 
special pasture study shown in this bulletin. Neither are 
any experimental tests shown. This is due to the fact that 
a small percentage of the Delta land is devoted to perman- 
ent pasture and not as much improvement and experiment- 
al work has been done as in other soil areas of Mississippi. 
However, Dr. H. W. Bennett, Mississippi Agricultural Ex- 
periment Station, State College, Mississippi, made a special 
study in 1944 of pastures in this Area, a summary of which 
is given below. Recommendations are also given on land 
preparation, seeding and pasture management. 

Study of Pastures in the Mississippi Delta*

the Delta will closely parallel those found essential and ef-

122 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 



ficient in the hill sections, with few exceptions, was shown 
by an observational survey made during the past spring 
and summer of Delta pastures. The principal exceptions 
are directly related to soil fertility, and some deviations 
from the recommended State-wide pasture mixture will be 
necessary for larger yields and a longer summer grazing 
period. 

This survey was made by the writer through the coop- 
eration of the District and County Agents of the Delta, 
interviews with planters, and A.A.A. records as to acre- 
age, numbers and types of animals grazed, and included 
studies of method, time, amounts and kinds of seed sown, 
and mowing, fertilization, and other management practices. 

Unfortunately, good permanent pastures, especially dur- 
ing July, August, and September, are in the minority in 
the Delta; but the fact that some do exist indicates that 
more good pastures can be developed in this section. 

The survey has forcibly shown that those engaged in 
livestock enterprises, have made excellent progress in pas- 
ture development. It has as forcibly shown the lack of the 
application of some practices known to be sound and effi- 
cient, especially grazing management and timely mowing. 
Eecause of a higher level of fertility in the Delta soils, com- 
binations of spring clovers with summer clovers and grass- 
es were found difficult to maintain, requiring special at- 
tention to seeding and management. An urgent need for 
experimental work on pastures for the Delta Area was 
clearly shown. 

The opinions, observations, and recommendations here- 
in reported are those based entirely on the impressions and 
information gained by the writer from this survey and are 
not to be construed as a report of experimental informa- 
tion or data. However, most of the recommendations will 
be based on these spring and summer observations in con- 
junction with information from data obtained from pas- 
ture experiments carried on in all parts of the hill section 
of Mississippi. 

Preparation for Delta Pastures 

It was noted that many seedings, regardless of whether 
:grass or clovers or both, were thin, and some entirely lost. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI

because of not allowing time for the prepared seedbed to 
become firm. Such preparation has proven worse than no 
preparation at all, other than removing extremely large and 
dense growth of undesirable weeds or other plants. 

Many areas were plowed deep with moldboard plows and 
then disked or harrowed until a good seedbed was prepared 
on the surface. In the process of this plowing, clods, grass 
and weeds were buried from 6 to 9 inches deep, and after 
the subsequent disking or harrowing or both — which per- 
haps completely pulverized the top 3 or 4 inches of soil — 
there remained a layer of clods, grass and weeds, some 3 
to 4 inches thick between the pulverized surface and the 
plow-sole. Seed grown on such areas germinated, started 
to grow, but when the roots struck this "spongy" area, in 
seasons of small showers or light rainfall, they died. Seed 
sown on areas well disked and harrowed immediately after- 
wards, without firming with rain, suffered a like fate or 
else were buried by heavy rains. Areas disked, harrowed, 
seeded, and cultipacked is -by far the better method where 
time is not allowed for firming. 

A firm seedbed is an accepted principle in pasture estab- 
lishment. It is recommended in Mississippi Experiment 
Station Bulletin 356 that "where soil preparation is made, 
it should be done far enough in advance of planting for 
the seedbed to become firm. All experimental evidence 
points to the necessity for seeding on a firm seedbed." A 
mixture of white Dutch, hop, and Persian clovers seeded 
on pastures at the Natchez Branch Station, October 1943, 
without any preparation was 3 to 4 inches higher the first 
of April 1944 than on adjoining areas that were disked 
and harrowed just before seeding. Recommendation: Un- 
der all types of preparation, prepare land far enough in 
advance of planting for the seedbed to become firmed by 
rain. 

Seeding Mixtures 

Observations, Delta wide except for the foothills, proved 
that some changes are necessary for the Delta from the 
now State-wide recommended seeding mixtures. Almost 
in every case, where there were spring clovers, there was. 



124 MISSISSIPPI EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 419 

little or almost no summer grazing. This indicates that 
winter or spring growing clovers had smothered and killed 
out the following lespedeza and much of the grass, except 
where severe periodic grazing or mowing were practiced. 
This is also true of fertile bottoms in the hills, or pastures 
heavily fertilized with minerals, and the present recommen- 
dations are to sow a spring clover without lespedeza on 
grass in the bottom sites and lespedeza without a spring 
clover on grass on the slopes. 

Johnson grass appeared to be the only grass able to pro- 
duce after spring clovers, which is due to the fact that 
this grass begins growth later in the spring than Dallis. 
Dallis grass begins growth with the first warm weather in 
the winter and spring and is therefore competing with the 
winter and spring growing clovers or ryegrass. 

However, several Dallis grass and white Dutch pastures 
were furnishing good summer Dallis grass grazing, but 
these had been grazed heavily during the spring. This 
heavy grazing prevented excessive growth of clover and al- 
lowed the Dallis grass to grow in combination with the 
clover. 

Winter ryegrass seeded on so-called permanent pastures 
also smothered spring and summer growing plants. There 
were several pastures in the Delta consisting of Dallis and 
Bermuda grasses and lespedeza, but no spring clover, which 
were furnishing excellent grazing during August and Sep- 
tember. Also several pastures consisting only of Dallis 
grass and lespedeza were being grazed in those months. 

Under conditions observed in the Yazoo-Mississippi 
Delta : 

1. Because of heavy growth of spring clovers, other 
plants usually included in pasture mixtures to provide sea- 
son-long grazing, were difficult to establish or maintain 
and furnished scant grazing. 

2. Johnson grass withstood the clover competition most 
successfully. 

3. Lespedeza was not successfully grown in combination 
with spring clover in any pasture or under any manage- 
ment practice observed. 



IMPROVING PASTURES IN MISSISSIPPI 



125 



4. Dallis grass and Bermuda grass were successfully 
grown in combination with spring clovers only where the 
spring clover was severely grazed or clipped. 

5. Dallis grass and lespedeza as well as Bermuda and les- 
pedeza, were successfully grown in combination in pastures 
where there was no ryegrass or winter clover. 

These conditions are due mainly to soil fertility and mois- 
ture conditions. For pasture clover production in the hills, 
relatively heavy annual applications of phosphate and per- 
iodic applications of lime and potash are recommended due 
to the lack of fertility in the hill soils. Most of the Delta 
soils, however, are so fertile as to produce an excellent 
growth of pasture legumes without the addition of mineral 
fertilizers. A comparison of the range of available amounts 
of phosphate (P-0') and potash (K-0) in the hill and Delta 
soils is shown below.

Along with this high content of minerals so beneficial to 
legume growth, ample rainfall is usually had during the 
winter and spring, and these result in a heavy growth of 
spring clovers and a subsequent smothering of plants that 
begin growth later in the spring. The summer-growing 
plants are often handicapped by insufficient rainfall. 

Soil fertility, moisture conditions, and plant competition 
makes the phrase ''permanent pasture" a very doubtful one 
for most soils of the Delta. Rather than so-called perma- 
nent pastures, this survey points to the use of ''rotational 
pastures." 

Recommendations of Seeding Mixtures 

1. Use spring clovers (white Dutch, hop, Persian, wild 
winter peas, bur, alsike, red, crimson, on sandy well-drain- 
ed soil) only as winter and spring temporary pastures. Do 
not sow on areas where lespedeza is wanted. Cattle should

MECHANIZATION OF THE COTTON HARVEST 

By 

FRANK J. WELCH and D. GRAY MILEY^ 



Man in his tireless search to find more 
efficient and effective ways of doing 
things has made great progress through 
the centuries in the fields of science, tech- 
nology, and operational techniques. His 
material progress started with the utiliza- 
tion of tools; it has progressed as the 
quantity and quality of these tools have 
progressed. In the final analysis, there- 
fore, the quantity and quality of the 
goods and services produced depend in 
large measure upon the effectiveness of 
man's tools and the efficiency with which 
these tools are used. 

Technical Progress in Agriculture 

The most phenomenal technological 
progress has perhaps been made in the 
broad general field of industry, but great 
progress has also been made in the field 
of agriculture. The number of workers 
required to produce the food supply in 
our own country has dropped precipi- 
tously every decade since the beginning of 
the 19th century. In 1840, for instance, 
more than three-fourths of all workers in 
the United States were on farms as con- 
trasted with slightly less than one-fifth a 
century later. 

Starting around 1850 and continuing to 
the present time, suet patented farm im- 
plements as the chilled steel plow, power 
reaper, power thresher, disk harrow, hay 
ing machines, combine, twine binder, disk 
plow, and the modern tractor with its 
wide range of attachments, have all con- 
tributed materially to the increased unit 
output per agricultural worker and the 
reduction decade by decade of the relative 
percentage of workers on farms. See fig- 
ure 1. 

It should not be assumed, however, 
that increased efficiency in agricultural 
production is due solely to improved ma- 



chinery and power. In addition to more 
power and increased numbers and effic- 
iency of machines, production efficiency 
has increased significantly as a result of 
the introduction, adaptation, and improve- 
ment of plants and livestock; the increas- 
ed ability to meet the challenge of in- 
sects, pests, and diseases; the increase in 
knowledge relative to the use and replen- 
ishment of soils; and finally, the improve- 
ment in managerial and marketing tech- 
niques. Continued progress may be ex- 
pected in these fields as well as in the 
field of technology. 

For whatever cause, the fact that the 
American farmer is able to produce the 
food and fiber to meet the needs of ap- 
proximately five persons in addition to 
his own needs, accounts in large measure 
for the very high standard of living that 
now prevails in the United States. Those 
nations the world over that have made 
the greatest economic progress are those 
that have been able to produce their food 
and fiber supply with a decreasing per- 
centage of total workers engaged in agri- 
culture. 

Cotton Production Inefficiencies and 
Exchange Penalties 

Less progress has perhaps been made 
in the application of machine labor-sav- 
ing devices to the production and harvest- 
ing of cotton than to any other major 
crop in American agriculture. Prior to 
World War I, about the same amount of 
labor was required to produce a pound 
of cotton as in 1860. Since then, some 
progress has been made in utilizing pow- 
er equipment and improved machinery 
in seedbed preparation and in the culti- 
vation of cotton, which has reduced 
the total man hour labor require- 
ments for cotton production. The fact. 



subsequent report will deal with mechanization and other labor saving practices as they 
relate to the planting and cultivation of cotton.

however, that a large amount of hand 
labor is still required to harvest the crop 
has hampered progress in the application 
of improved tools and techniques in the 
planting and cultivation of cotton. Con- 
sequently, much of the cotton crop is still 
produced with hand labor, which ac- 
counts in large measure for the low out- 
put per worker in cotton production. 

The income status of the vast army of 
cotton field workers is adversely aflect- 
cd by the fact that the product of their 
toil is exchanged in the market place 
with goods much of which have been 
produced by skilled workers using tools 
that have multiplied their efficiency many- 
fold. A man cultivating with a hoe or 
working with his bare hands in the har- 



vesting of cotton is not a competitive 
equal in terms of earning power with a 
man working with a tractor or other 
farm power equipment. 

As a means of further complicating the 
American cotton producer's already un- 
favorable economic position, he has been 
forced to sell his product in the com- 
petitive world market and buy many of 
the products he uses and consumes on the 
farm in a sheltered tariff protected mar- 
ket at home.^ In more recent years mo- 
nopoly prices have also taken additional 
toll from his already meager income. In 
addition, credit has, generally speaking, 
been scarce and expensive. 

3 Tariffs are not efifective on surplus agri- 
cultural products. 



MECHANIZATION OF THE COTTON HARVEST 



5 



Thus, production inefficiencies, high 
credit costs, the sale of cotton in an er- 
ratic and unstable world market, and the 
purchase of many of the products used 
in the home and on the farm in a tarifl 
sheltered and/or otherwise partial mo- 
nopoly market, explain in large measure 
why the cotton producers of the South 
receive the lowest real, as well as monetary 
income, of any group of workers in Amer- 
ica. The amelioration of some of these 
problems is within the reach of the 
cotton producers themselves; whereas, 
other important causal factors can be 
dealt with only from a national or mter 
national level. 

Ever since the rapid development ol 
cotton production in the Southern col 
onies, there has been a reasonably ade- 
quate supply of unskilled cheap hand 
labor available in the Cotton Belt foi 
the production and harvesting of the 
American cotton crop by simple direct 
hand methods. While the income to the 
cotton field worker, whether tenant oi 
operating owner, has been extremely low, 
he has managed to eke out a tolerable 
existence and more than reproduce him- 



self* and hope that the following year 
would bring about improved conditions. 
Even though his economic and social 
status has been deplored from time to 
time, little or nothing has been done that 
would induce self improvement or ad 
vance significantly the low income posi 
tion of the cotton producer except tem 
porarily as a result of wars and crop 
failures or other general economic dis 
locations. 

Cotton Outlook Unfavorable 

The current outlook for cotton is such 
that apparently something definite and 
tangible will have to be done in the post 
war period to safeguard even the pres- 
ent unsatisfactory economic position oi 
the cotton producer. The ever increasing 
competition of producers in other coun- 
tries and the phenomenal increase in 
synthetic and substitute products for cot 
ton in both the domestic and foreign 
markets will no doubt complicate the cot 
ton situation immeasurably.

I and World War II, the general trend 
of acreage planted to cotton in foreign 
countries was upward; whereas, cottor 
acreage in the United States was reduc 
ed sharply during the latter part of this 
same period. See figure 2. Cotton yields 
have been much lower in most foreign 
countries than in the United States, but 
distinct progress is being made with re- 
spect to improved yields and, as a con- 
sequence, foreign production exceeded 
United States production in 1934 and has 
been above total domestic production 
since that time. See figure 3. 

A number of substitute and synthetic 
products such as paper, nylon, casein, 
spun glass, and rayon, have entered the 
market as serious competitors of cotton. 
The most important of these is rayon, a 
synthetic product made from fibrous cel- 
lulose. The production of rayon fila- 
ment yarn and rayon staple fiber has 



been phenomenal within recent years. 
In 1943 there was a total of 663 miUion 
pounds of both rayon filament yarn and 
rayon staple fiber produced in the United 
States. This is equivalent to 1,560,000 
bales of cotton. The world production 
of rayon in 1942 was 3,473 million pounds 
or the equivalent of 8,172,000 bales oi 
cotton. The increased production of 
rayon in the United States in 1944 over 
1943 was the equivalent of approximately 
500,000 bales of cotton. See figure 4. 

The price relationship between cotton 
and rayon as competitive products is ex 
tremely important. The price of rayon 
filament yarn decreased sharply from ap 
proximately $2.00 per pound in 1925 tc 
about 60 cents per pound by around 1932, 
and has fluctuated between 52 cents and 
60 cents per pound since that time. Rayon 
staple fiber entered the marketing field

around 1928 at 60 cents per pound and 
by 1938 had decUned to 25 cents pei 
pound, at which approximate level it has 
since remained. See figure 5. 

It is predicted that the price of rayon 
will be still further reduced following 
the war. Due to losses of fiber in the 
processing and utilization of cotton, it 
must sell for approximately one-tenth less 
than rayon in order to be on a competi- 
tive price basis with rayon. See table 1.

Reduced Production Cost Needed 

Considering the low economic status 
of cotton producers generally, a possible 
reduction in the relative price of cotton 
means that cotton will have to be pro- 
duced more cheaply, and that as a mat- 
ter of equity and economic necessity the 
exchange penalties previously mentioned 
will have to be removed. Reduced cost 
of production can be effected through the 
use of better tools, more efficient practices, 
and through the production of better 
quality cotton. The improvement of the 
exchange status of the cotton producer 
will be accomplished through appropriate 
public policy and programs. 

Cotton Harvest Labor Requirements 
The amount of hand labor required to 
harvest an acre of cotton varies with the 
yield, stand, prevalence of weeds, variety 
of cotton, and physical characteristics of 
the soil on which cotton is grown. For 
the country as a whole, approximately 57 
percent of the unweighted man hour lab- 



or requirements for the production of an 
acre of cotton is required for harvesting. 
In the Mississippi Delta Area, from 60 
to 65 percent of total labor is required for 
harvesting, depending on the degree of 
mechanization; and for the irrigated areas 
of the West, 67 percent of total labor 
is for harvesting. It is thus obvious that 
the perfection of a mechanical cotton har- 
vesting machine would make possible a 
drastic reduction in the man labor requir- 
ed for the production of an acre of cot- 
ton. See table 2. 

Low Farm Machinery Ratio 

The amount of machinery on South- 
ern cotton farms is considerably less thai» 
that found in other farming areas of the 
country. Comparisons are indicated in 
table 3. Even though farm machinery 
value ratios to crop acreage and to farms 
are slightly higher for the Delta planta 
tion areas than for non-plantation areas 
of the Cotton Belt in the Southeast, the 
resultant labor efficiency within the 
plantation area has been largely with 
crops other than cotton. 

Increased use of power and machin- 
ery in seedbed preparation and in culti- 
vation have resulted in somewhat higher 
cotton yields per acre and more efficient 
utilization of land and labor in these 
processes. So long, however, as labor must 
be kept on the plantation for hoeing and 
picking regardless of labor efficiencies in 
the other production processes, neither 
labor nor management can take full ad- 
vantage of such efficiencies. They merely 
tend, to aggravate the already rather acute 
underemployment problems^. 

The successful harvesting of cotton 
with machinery will give added impetus 
to mechanization and improved practices 
for the total production process. Such an 
adjustment will certainly increase very

significantly the per unit labor output on 
cotton farms, reduce unit cost, and 
should, at least in the short run, tend 
toward an increase in cotton farm labor 
income. 

The only remaining serious bottleneck 
with reference to hand labor requirements 



will be that of chopping and weeding 
the cotton. Less progress has perhaps 
been made to date in eliminating hand 
labor in thinning the cotton to a stand 
and eliminating the grass, weeds, and 
vines that cultivators will not get than 
in any other phase of the production pro- 
cess. This is the next big problem in the 
way of complete mechanization. How- 
ever, some progress is being made through 
cross-cultivation and check-rowing of 
cotton, and experiments conducted at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station indicate 
that the flame cultivator shows some 
promise as a possibility for filling this 
gap.^ (Figure 7). 

Cotton Harvesting Machinery 
Despite the many attempts that have 
been made to develop a satisfactory me- 
chanical cotton harvesting machine, most 
of the cotton produced today throughout 
the world is still harvested by the time- 
wasting, back-breaking methods used 
thousands of years ago when the Pha- 
raohs reigned in the valley of the Nile. 
There has been no lack of persistent effort 
through the years to develop a mechanical 
cotton picking machine. The disappoint- 
ing results of such persistent effort at- 
test to the many difficulties associated 
with the problem. As early as 1850, S.

S. Rembert and }. Prescott of Memphis. 
Tennessee, were issued a patent on a 
mechanical cotton picking machine. Since 
that time, hundreds of patents covering 
many kinds of mechanical cotton harvest- 
ing devices have been issued."^ 

Even though a very wide range of de- 
vices have been used experimentally in 
an effort to find a satisfactory cotton har- 
vesting machine, most of the efforts can 
be grouped into five general classes as 
follows: (1) picker type, designed to 
pick the cotton from the open bolls by 
means of spindles, fingers, or prongs, (2) 
thresher type, which severs the stalk and 
takes the entire plant into the machine 
where the cotton and vegetative matter

are separated, (3) pneumatic type, which 
attempts to remove the cotton from the 
bolls either by suction or blasts of air. 
(4) the electric type, designed to attract 
the cotton fiber to a statically charged 
belt to remove the cotton from the boll, 
and, (5) the stripper type, designed to 
remove the cotton bolls by combing the 
plant with teeth or by drawing it between 
stationary slots or revolving rolls. 

Considerable progress has been made 
in the development of the picker type 
and stripper type machines during the 
past decade. The stripper machine is bet- 
ter adapted to the sub-humid regions 
of Texas and Oklahoma; the picker 
type machine is being used in the Missis- 
sippi Delta and other relatively level cot- 
ton producing areas where the plant 
growth is relatively rank and the yield 
high.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 420

Since the data for this report were ob- 
tained in Mississippi, and since the 
stripper has been used only to a very 
limited extent and largely on an expcri 
mental basis in this State, only the pickei 
type machine will be included in this re- 
port^. Two general type pickers employ- 
ing combinations of spindles and doffers 
have been developed. These two types 
are known as high-drum pickers and low- 
drum pickers. The former operate suc- 
cessfully in cotton growing up to 5 feet: 
whereas, the latter is used where the cot- 
ton stalk is lYz feet or less in height. The 
low-drum machine is not adapted to Mis 
sissip,pi Delta conditions where the cotton 
plant usually grows rank. 

^Records were kept on International Harvester 
machines. The Rust machine was also operated 
on an experimental basis within the State, but 
data arc not available on its operation. 



The high-drum machine is described 
by the International Harvester Company 
as follows: 

"The high-drum picker (known as No. 
H-IO-H) is mounted on the rear of the 
modified Farmall-H tractor, which pro- 
vides power to operate the picker and 
propel it through the fields. The rear 
of the tractor, however, becomes the 
front. Modifications include a high- 
clearance axle which provides the means 
of reversing the travel of the tractor from 
forward to rearward and lowers the gear 
ratios for proper picking speeds. 

"The pickers are provided with two ver- 
tical and parallel revolving drums be 
tween which the cotton plants pass as the 
machine moves forward along the rows 
Each drum is equipped with cam-actuat- 
ed picker bars on which are mounted 
rotating spindles having numerous tiny 



MECHANIZATION OF THE COTTON HARVEST 



13 



needles or barbs which catch the Hnt. 
The rotative speed of the picker drums 
is synchronized with the travehng speed 
of the tractor so that the projecting rotat- 
ing picker spindles enter and withdraw 
from the plants without any raking ac- 
tion and without disturbing the unopen- 
ed bolls or otherwise injuring the plants. 
As the rotating spindles penetrate the 
plants and contact the lint in the open 
bolls, the barbs catch the cotton and ex- 
tract it. As the cam-actuated picker bars 
carry these cotton-laden spindles around, 
they are withdrawn from the plants and 
the cotton is removed by rubber doflFers 
which rotate m close proximity to the 



spindles and thus remove the cotton. Be- 
fore the spindles contact the open bolls, 
they pass under moistened rubber pads 
which moisten the spindles to assist in 
doffing the cotton. There is a water 
tank and metering system which sup- 
plies water to the rubber pads in uniform 
amounts controlled by the operator to give 
best results. 

"After removal from the spindles the 
cotton is conveyed by vacuum to a sepa- 
rating chamber where considerable trash 
is removed. It is then blown up into 
the storage basket by air pressure pro- 
duced by fan equipment. As the cotton 
enters the basket it passes along a grating

United States Cotton Ginning Laboratory. 



14 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 420 



which further assists in removing trash. 
The basket holds approximately one-half 
bale of seed cotton. When the basket is 
filled, the cotton is dumped into wagon 
or truck by a mechanism powered by 
the Farmall hydraulic lift. 

"The driver is the only attendant re- 
quired to operate the machine. He sits 
comfortably above the drum box where 
he has a full view of the row of cotton 
plants being picked, which flow continu- 
ously through the drum box." See figure 

No doubt, considerable improvement 
will be made in the present cotton pick- 
ing machines and the present retail price 
can probably be reduced when the ma- 
chines are produced on assembly-line 
basis. Su^^icient progress has been made 
to date, however, to demonstrate the 
feasibility of the mechanical harvester 
both from the operational and cost view- 
points, at least under current conditions 
of relatively high wages and scarce labor 
supplies. 

Mechanical Operation, 1944 

Detailed operational records were kept 
on the mechanical pickers that were used 
on a practical farm basis in 1944. There 
was a total of 12 of these machines. Rec- 
ords were also kept on the operation of 
two additional experimental machines, 
which data were used largely as a check 
against actual field data. 

In addition to machine operation data, 
mformation was collected on the efTect 
of machine on grade and the amount of 
cotton left by the pickers in the fields. On 
all of the plantations using mechanical 
pickers, cotton was also picked by hand. 
The comparative grades and prices of ma- 
chine-picked cotton and hand-picked cot- 
ton were compiled for each day of harvest 
throughout the season in such a way as 
to make daily comparisons from the same 
plantations as well as a seasonal com- 
parison. 

Figures were also compiled by actual 
boll count on one plantation and by esti- 



mates on all plantations on the amount 
of cotton left in the field by machines. 
The effect on income of grade reduction 
and loss of cotton in the field will be in- 
dicated later. 

Cost of Mechanically Picked 
Cotton, 1944 

A total of 2,229 bales of cotton was 
picked during the 1944 season by the 12 
machines studied, or a seasonal average 
of 186 bales per machine. The number 
of days which a machine can operate dur- 
ing a season, the topography of cotton 
fields, length of cotton rows, prevalence 
of weeds, and variety of cotton, are fac- 
tors that influence the amount of cotton 
that can be picked in a day or during 
the season. A single machine will cover 
from 4 to 8 acres per day, which means, 
on the average for Delta conditions, from 
4 to 10 bales of cotton per day can be 
harvested per machine.^ During the 1944 
season, the 12 machines for which rec- 
ords are available operated an average 
of 430 hours, or 43 ten-hour days. The 
machines actually picked an average of 
4.3 bales for each 10 hours they were in 
operation.^ ^ 

The average cost, not including grade 
loss or value of cotton left in the field, 
for mechanically picking Jt bale of cotton 
in 1944 was $7.38. This cost was divid- 
ed as follows: direct operating cost, $3.84; 
depreciation, and interest cost, $3.54. See 
table 4 for detailed cost items. 

Some of these cost figures should be 
regarded as tentative, especially those for 
maintenance and repairs. The manufac-

covered by the machines is available for only 
one plantation. This machine operated during 
a part or all of 49 days and averaged operating 
9.8 hours per day, a part of which was at night. 
A total of 228 acres was covered and 202 bales 
were picked. An average of 4.1 bales of cotton 
was picked from 4.7 acres each day the picker 
operated.

turers are still experimenting with the 
machine, consequently, some replacement 
parts and some repairs made by the Com- 
pany were not included in the cost items. 
Only normal repair and upkeep charg'^s. 
as nearly as these could be judged to be 
normal, were included in the cost items. 
Also, depreciation charges are rough esti- 
mates due to lack of actual experience 
with reference to length of life of the ma- 
chines. Pickers were depreciated at the 
rate of 20 percent per annum "straight 
line," and tractors at the same rate but 
for only one-fourth the time since tractors 
are normally used for other farm work 
the other three-fourths of the year. 

Major adjustments for tractors are nec- 
essary when pickers are attached.^ ^ The 
average cost for parts at the time of con- 
version was $100, which amount was 
j:dded to the cost of pickers. Installation 
labor cost was approximately $50 and this 
was included with the miscellaneous 
items, which also included some other 
minor costs such as service costs for trail- 
ers used in servicing machines in the field 
and a few other very minor miscellaneous 
items. 

The average cost of the pickers deliver- 
ed to the plantations was $3,924, includ- 



See page 12 of this bulletin. 



ing $1,250 for the tractors on which the 
pickers were mounted. Thus the average 
cost of the pickers including conversion 
kit was $2,674. The interest rate on in- 
vestment was calculated at 4 percent per 
annum on one-half the value of the pick- 
ers and one-half of the proportion of the 
tractor investment charged to the picking 
operation. 

Grade Loss 

Despite the excellent progress that has 
been made and continues to be made, 
both with respect to the operation of the 
picker and for cleaning equipment at 
gins, cotton picked with mechanical har- 
vesters is given a lower grade and thus 
sells in the market place at a discount 
over that of hand-picked cotton. 

The machine-picked cotton averaged 
1.4 grades lower than cotton picked by 
hand on the same plantation on the same 
days for the 1944 season. The average 
grade for 3,506 bales of hand-picked cot- 
ton was slightly above strict low mid- 
dling; whereas, the average grade for 
2,229 bales of machine-picked cotton was 
slightly below low middling, or a dif- 
ference of 1.4 grades. The range of grade 
differences ran from 0.8 grade on one 
plantation to 2.2 grades on another planta- 
tion. There was a diflerence of 0.2 of 
one staple length in favor of machine-

picked cotton, which may or may not be 

a significant difference in fiber length. 

The Delta Branch Experiment Station at 

Stoneville reports a comparable difference 

from unpublished data gathered in 
1944 12 

The average price for the grade of hand- 
picked cotton for the period September 
1, 1944, through January 31, 1945, on 
the Memphis market was 21.73 cents per 
pound; whereas, the average price of the 
grade of machine-picked cotton in the 
same market during the same period of 
time was 18.05 cents per pound. The 
difference is equal to 3.68 cents per 
pound or an average of $18.40 per bale 
in favor of the hand-picked cotton. See 
table 5. 

Spinning Quality 

The Department of Agriculture, War 
Food Administration, Cotton and Fiber 
Branch, Stoneville, Mississippi, in pre- 
liminary tests have found that machine- 
picked cotton is slightly superior (strong- 
er yarn) to that of hand-picked cotton. 
This is probably due to the fact that the 
shorter, weaker staple that constitutes the 
more undesirable cotton is left in the field 
under machine picked conditions; and 
when the market comes to recognize this 
factor, the income loss as a result of ex- 
cess grade penalty will be less than it is 
at the present time. 

Defoliation 

Most of the machine-picked cotton 
had been defoliated by dusting the plants 
with calcium cyanamide dust. This cost 
was not added as an extra item for ma- 
chine-picked cotton, since much of the 
hand-picked cotton was also defoliated in 



the same way. 

By thus ridding the stalks of leaves, 
the bolls are exposed to the sun rays 
which hasten the opening of the cotton 
and facilitate somewhat the harvesting 
of cotton by both hand and machine 
methods. 

Variety Influence 

There is some indication that cotton 
variety may be important in terms of 
adaptation to mechanical harvest. Addi- 
tional studies are now under way at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station, Stone- 
ville, Mississippi, and further evidence 
will be secured from actual field experi- 
ence, but sufficient data are now lacking 
from which to draw any definite conclu- 
sions with reference to the importance 
of variety on machine harvest. 

Cotton Gin Cleaning Equipment 

Considerable progress has been made 
m the development and installation of 
driers and cleaning equipment on modern 
cotton gins. Further progress is needed, 
however, as evidenced by loss of grades 
as previously indicated. Significant prog- 
ress, however, appears to have been made 
during the past season. A newly design- 
ed cleaner called the "impact cleaner" 
was installed late in the season, and the 
results obtained on late season, very 
trashy hand-picked, machine-picked, and 
snapped cotton were striking. Cotton 
that would have undoubtedly been class- 
ed as strict good ordinary was raised to 
as high as strict low middling as a re-

suit of the usage of this cleaner. See fig- 
ure 9. 

There is also some question as to 
whether this cleaner will give the same 
results on early picked cotton as on late 
picked cotton. 

The successful development of satis- 
factory cleaning equipment will eliminate 
the most significant single item of cost 
associated with the mechanical harvester. 
An approach to the solution of this prob- 
lem is being made through breeding of 
varieties better adapted to mechanical 
harvesting, through establishment of clean- 
ing equipment on pickers, and through 
development of better drying and clean- 
ing equipment at the gin. 

Cotton Left in Field 

The amount of cotton left in the field 
as a result of machine operation over 
that which would have been left by hand 
picking, is a loss that needs to be con- 
sidered along with the other cost items. 



A detailed daily record on the basis of 
actual boll count was kept on one planta- 
tion throughout the season and the re- 
sults showed that 91 percent of the open 
cotton at the time of harvest was picked 
by machine. Thus 9 percent of the cot- 
ton was left either on the stalks or on 
the ground. Estimates were made on 
other plantations, and it would appear, 
even though objective data were secured 
from only one plantation, that this per- 
centage loss is about average for all the 
plantations studied. The losses were ap- 
parently higher in some instances and 
lower in others. Progress is being made 
in this respect through breeding and ma- 
chine improvement. 

Some cotton will be left in the field 
even when hand-picked. If we assume, 
therefore, that with hand labor approxi- 
mately 2 percent of the cotton will be 
left, then there is a net loss of 7 percent 
of cotton due to machine operation. On 



18 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 420 



the basis of current prices for hand-pick- 
ed cotton and cottonseed, and after al- 
lowing for the cost of picking, this is 
the equivalent of about $7.62 per bale. 
However, from the standpoint of the pro- 
ducer, the loss of cotton in the field is 
partly oflFset by the additional weight of 
machine-picked cotton which is due to 
foreign matter added in the picking pro- 
cess. Tests show that machine-harvested 
cotton has about 7 percent more foreign 
matter than hand-picked cotton. The cot- 
ton left in the field, however, is an eco- 
nomic loss and should therefore be con- 
sidered in any general comparisons of 
the two methods of harvesting cotton. 

Machine vs. Hand Picking Costs 

All items of operating cost and losses 
associated with machine-picked cotton 
considered, the actual direct cost of op- 
erating the picking machine is one of the 
smallest items involved. See table 6. 
Total costs and losses, including cost of 
picking, loss in grade, and loss of cot- 
ton left in field, was $33.40 per bale in 
1944. 

The cost of hand picking averaged 
$2.36 per hundred pounds or $37.76 per 
bale (1600 pounds of seed cotton) on the 
plantations included in this study for 
1944. Comparisons at different picking 
rates can be readily made by the reader. 
See table 6. 

Favorable Factors in Shift to 
Mechanization 

Under conditions of stringent labor 
shortages, such as existed in 1944, there 
are certain advantages associated with ma- 
chine operation that may not be reflected 
in comparative cost figures. The time- 
liness of harvest is an important factor, 



since the quality and grade of cotton usu- 
ally deteriorate rather rapidly as the sea- 
son advances due to weather conditions. 
The worry and uncertainty of getting the 
cotton picked under any conditions is also 
an important factor. See figure 10. 

There are also certain other factors, 
not reflected in the comparative cost 
figures in this report, that are significant 
in terms of a shift to machine harvest. 
On the large plantations there is a heavy 
capital investment in living quarters and 
a recurring upkeep cost that is quite 
heavy. Moreover, seasonal labor is usu- 
ally required even under the sharecropper 
system, the recruitment of which is 
bothersome and expensive under condi- 
tions of a relatively adequate labor sup- 
ply. Adoption of the mechanical picker 
would, as has already been suggested, 
make feasible more complete mechaniza- 
tion in the whole production process and 
would reduce or practically eliminate the 
cost of maintaining a large number of 
tenant houses and the bother and expense 
of labor recruitment and labor manage- 
ment problems. 

The relative over-all cost of mechanical 
harvesting versus hand picking will, of 
course, be the major factor in determin- 
ing the rate and extent at which shifts 
are made to machine harvest. Such a 
shift, however, will involve a rather dras- 
tic reorganization of plantation operation. 
A careful over-all analysis, therefore, of 
operation under a system of machine op- 
eration compared with operation under 
the hand labor system will be required 
before all the cost factors can be consider- 
ed for comparative purposes. Further 
studies will make such comparison pos- 
sible.

Retarding Factors in Shift to 
Mechanization 

Even though there is evidence that the 
key to complete mechanization of the cot- 
ton industry is closer to reality today 
than ever before, any assumption that 
there w^ill be a rapid and extensive shift 
to complete mechanization should be ex- 
amined carefully. Had the mechanical 
picker been at the technological stage of 
development at the outbreak of the war 
that it is now, and had these machines 
been available during the war period, 
there can be little doubt that extensive 
utilization of mechanical harvesters would 
have resulted. 

Distinct progress in mechanized cotton 
production will, no doubt, continue to be 
made in the postwar period, but the rate 
and extent of mechanization may be at a 
slower tempo than many people now 
anticipate. In the first place, agriculture 
continues to stand face to face with the 



problem of an increasing potential capac- 
ity to produce out of proportion to its 
capacity to gain outlets for its products. 
Secondly, some of the rural farm labor 
that will be displaced have had almost no 
experience with industrial discipline and 
complicated machinery, and some of them 
have had little experience in independent 
self direction as a result of the paternalis- 
tic character of the plantation system. 

These special handicaps, coupled with 
the distinct possibility that there will be 
an increase generally in the number of 
rural persons hemmed in by limited op- 
portunities in both city and country, may 
further retard the shift to complete 
mechanization. It should not be forgot- 
ten, furthermore, that less than a decade 
ago the leading newspapers in this area 
were advocating the junking of all me- 
chanical cotton pickers in the Mississippi 
River as anti-social instruments and eco- 
nomically detrimental to the people with- 



20 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 420 



in the area. Also the Agricultural Ad- 
justment Administration was following a 
policy of restricting or attempting to re- 
strict farm labor displacements. In case 
of rather widespread unemployment, it 
is quite probable that certain social and 
administrative restraints will again be 
used to discourage further farm labor dis- 
placement. 

Finally, the shift to mechanical opera- 
tion will all but destroy the old planta- 
tion system as it has existed since shortly 
after the Civil War. The large operating 
units under a single management will 
continue, but the existing paternalistic 
relationship between management and 
labor, the "furnish" system, the share- 
cropper pattern of operation — in short, 
the very heart and soul of an economic 
and social institutional system that has 
become a distinctive symbol and tradi- 
tional agrarian way of life in the Cotton 
Belt of the South, will have passed out 
of existence. Vested economic interest in 
the operation of phases of the old system, 
sentiment, and the heavy hand of inertia, 
will delay and hinder rapid shifts even 
assuming favorable economies associated 
with such shift. 

Influence of Technological Advance 
to Producers 

The assumption that widespread shift 
to mechanical production of cotton will 
automatically solve the income problem 
of cotton producers seems to be rather 
widely accepted. Such assumption needs 
critical examination. 

As a result of the existence of a large 
number of independent production units 
and intense competition, most of the gains 
in more efficient production in agricul- 
ture are, sooner or later, passed on to the 
consumer. Furthermore, the gains that 
do accrue to the producer are usually 
capitalized into increased land values. If 
improvements were adopted by producers 
simultaneously, consumers would un- 
doubtedly get most of the benefits of in- 
creased efiiciency quickly, but one of the 



most significant impacts of technological 
advancement in agriculture, however, is 
that farmers do not and cannot apply at 
equal rates the results of science and in- 
vention. New and old techniques continue 
side by side — the one-horse plow and the 
tractor operate in adjacent fields; one- 
horse wagons and modern trucks trans- 
port cotton to the same market; and very 
likely, the power harvester and the labor- 
er armed only with his bare hands and 
a sack across his back will both continue 
to harvest the American cotton crop for 
some time to come. 

As a result of uneven adoption of new 
machinery, scientific knowledge, and new 
techniques, farmers who first adopt these 
undoubtedly gain while others are follow- 
ing at an uneven pace. As more and 
more farmers follow in more efficient pro- 
duction, there is always a tendency for 
prices to fall or other adjustments to be 
made that tend to reduce or eliminate the 
direct economic gain to the producers. 
Furthermore, there is usually a significant 
number of farmers who, for one reason or 
another, cannot take advantage of the new 
efificient techniques, and consequently, 
their already low standard of living may 
be still further reduced as price is reduc- 
ed or as they are forced to make farm 
adjustments that bring lower returns than 
did the old system under the old price 
level. In the long run of course, it must 
be assumed that those not needed on the 
farms as a result of production efficiencies 
will find alternative employment either 
on or off the farm. 

The areas that will receive the great- 
est direct benefit from economies growing 
out of mechanization will be those areas 
in a position to first take advantage of 
the opportunity. And ultimately, of 
course, whatever efficiencies that may ac- 
crue will be reflected in either higher re- 
turns to producers or lower costs to con- 
sumers, or both, and the standard of liv- 
ing of people generally will be raised 
even though many individuals may find 



MECHANIZATION OF THE COTTON HARVEST 



21 



it difficult to make the necessary adjust- 
ments. In no other way can society make 
economic progress. 

There is still another benefit that will 
flow from production efficiency at this 
particular time. And this benefit needs 
special emphasis. The current and pros- 
pective competitive position of American 
cotton is the most hazardous and pre- 
carious in its long histoi7. Lower pro- 
duction costs reflected in lower selling 
price will strengthen the competitive posi- 
tion of cotton and result in a larger vol- 
ume of consumption in both the domestic 
and foreign markets. The wide disparity 
between income from an acre of cotton 
and the next best alternative enterprise in 
the major cotton producing areas makes 
it highly desirable to maintain as large a 
market for American cotton as possible. 
Social and Economic Effect of 
Mechanization 

A shift to mechanization of the cotton 
harvest will have its effects on both the 
cotton plantation and the "family size" 
farm unit, but the repercussions will be 
of a different nature. Mechanization will, 
of course, come first in the plantation 
areas, which will in turn tend to force 
changes in farm organization and opera- 
tion in the non-plantation areas. Despite 
certain gains that may accrue to certain 
producers, and despite the long-time gains 
to society in more efficient production 
and the improved competitive position of 
cotton, the immediate resultant economic 
and social dislocations and changes may 



be painful for both type areas unless off- 
farm employment is available. If so, they 
as well as those that remain on the farms 
will be benefitted. 

Displacement in Plantation Areas 

Complete mechanization of cotton pro- 
duction in the plantation areas is not ex- 
pected in the near future. But assuming 
relatively complete mechanization of 
the cotton harvest together with fuller 
mechanization of the other production 
processes, this will mean a significant dis- 
placement of labor in the cotton plantation 
areas. Even though the population dens- 
ity within the plantation areas is little, 
if any, higher than that for the non- 
plantation areas of the Southeast, cotton 
not only plays a much more important 
part in the economy of the plantation area 
than it does in other areas, but the planta- 
tion is much better adapted to more com- 
plete mechanization. See table 7 for 
comparative densities for farm population. 

As indicated earlier in this report, the 
resultant displacement of labor with 
mechanization will eliminate the need for 
plantation commissaries or stores and the 
plantation furnish system and in fact, de- 
stroy the established plantation system as 
is. This possibiHty emphasizes the very 
great need for developing alternative em- 
ployment opportunities within the area 
either on the farms, in industry, or in 
other types of employment. 

Under relatively complete mechaniza- 
tion it is difficult to forecast the probable 
displacement numbers, but such displace-

merit obviously will be high. The la- 
bor required to produce an acre of cot- 
ton using a mechanical picker is only 
37 percent of the labor required to pro- 
duce an acre of cotton using hand labor 
for harvesting, the equivalent of a 63 per- 
cent reduction in total man hour require- 
ments. This percentage change assumes 
the usage of multiple-row planters and 
cultivators, but even with multiple-row 
equipment, already in use, there is little 
doubt that still further reductions will be 
made in man hour requirements in plant- 
ing and cultivating when mechanical 
pickers can be introduced. Thus a con- 
servative estimate of labor displacement 
runs from 55 to 65 percent. 

A few plantations are already operating 
on a ratio of about one family for each 
100 acres of cropland by utilizing sea- 
sonal labor for chopping and picking. 
In 1940 there was one family for each 
27 acres of cropland in the Delta area. 
On the assumption that widespread adop- 
tion of the picker would make possible 
adjustment of the labor force to 100 acres 
of cropland for each family instead of 27 
acres per family as in 1940, then 73 per- 
cent of the present families would not be 
needed. 

In 1940 there were 64,683 farm fam- 
ilies, or a total farm population of 
287,111 in the 10 all-Delta counties. A 
73 percent reduction would mean that 
these counties alone would lose 47,218 
families and 209,591 in rural-farm 
popr'ition. But, as a matter of fact, the 
area has probably already lost from 30 to 
35 percent to the Selective Service and to 
war industries since 1940. If postwar 
conditions are such that few agricultural 
workers return to the area, then obvious- 
ly the effect of mechanization will be 
correspondingly less severe. 

Even though society will gain little or 
nothing in the short run from technolog- 
ical advancement in agriculture if dis- 
placed labor go to swell the relief rolls or 
are forced to find employment on made- 



work projects, such a contingency does 
not justify the discouragement of more 
efficient techniques of production. To do 
so would hamper or prevent economic 
progress and the gradual improvement in 
standards of living for everyone. How- 
ever, inasmuch as society benefits from 
such progress in the long run, society 
should contribute to cushioning the shock 
of technological unemployment and gen- 
eral economic and social dislocations that 
result from such progress. 

Adjustments in Non-Plantation Areas 

Relatively complete mechanization of 
the cotton harvest (and in turn, cotton 
production) will have its effect on the 
non-plantation areas of the Cotton Belt 
even though the adjustments will be 
somewhat of a different nature. The ratio 
of farm population to cropland indicates 
a relative dependence on intensive crop 
production equal to that in the plantation 
areas. See table 7. 

The non-plantation areas of the South 
ern cotton states are characterized by 
small operating units. Despite the fact 
that most of these units have only a small 
acreage of cotton, cotton and cottonseed 
products constitute the major cash in- 
come crop, and in fact, there is no alter- 
native crop outside the concentrated 
tobacco, peanut, and a few high specialty 
crop areas that will provide acreage or 
labor returns anywhere nearly equal to 
that of cotton. 

The vast majority of these farms are 
too small to shift to mechanized opera- 
tion; the topography of many others hin- 
ders or precludes shift to mechanized op- 
eration; many of them, equipped as they 
are now with little farm machinery and 
equipment, provide even less under these 
conditions than full employment the year 
round; and finally, the landscape is char- 
acterized by extensive erosion and poor 
management practices. The availability, 
therefore, of effective cotton picking ma- 
chines and other mechanized equipment 



MECHANIZATION OF THE COTTON HARVEST 



23 



provides little or no opportunity for im- 
proved practices and increased income in 
the absence of drastic reorganization and 
enlargement of operating units. 

The contention that these small "up 
land" operators can take advantage of 
mechanized operation either through co- 
operative purchase or custom service over- 
looks the fact that such an arrangement 
guarantees neither increased production 
nor cheaper production. As a matter of 
fact, if mechanized operation merely dis- 
places hand labor without providing al- 
ternative employment opportunities, cash 
costs may move up without cor- 
responding increase in income. With in- 
come already normally near the subsist- 
ence level, any such adjustment might be 
intolerable. In other words, any laboi 
income on these small units — whethei 
from women and children or whatever 
it might be — that would otherwise run to 
waste, is just that much additional in- 
come. The cotton picker would cut down 
sharply on practically the only source of 
employment for women and children on 
these small farms, which is desirable 
from both a social and economic view- 
point, provided of course some other 
means of maintaining or increasing the 
present income can be found. 

With the coming of mechanized cot 
ton production and its concomitant eco 
nomies in the areas adapted to mechaniz- 
ed operation, the areas of small cotton 
farm operation, under the impact of as- 
sumed lower cotton prices, may be forced 
to shift more to livestock and other crops. 
Such an adjustment will mean a more 
extensive type of agriculture, which in 
turn means that operating units will 
have to be enlarged and more machinery, 
equipment, buildings, and other operat- 
ing facilities provided. This will involve 
a very considerable reduction in farm 
population within these areas, change in 
ownership patterns, additional credit, and 
significant adjustments in the whole 
range of service institutions. There is nc 



reason to believe that these adjusiments 
will be any less painful or disturbing than 
those taking place in the plantation areas. 
General Summary and Conclusions 
There is evidence that the key to the 
successful mechanical harvesting of cot- 
ton and in turn the complete mechaniza- 
tion of cotton production, is closer to 
reality today than ever before. Actual 
farm experience with a sufficient number 
of machines during the past two or three 
seasons in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta 
has demonstrated the technical and eco- 
nomic feasibility of harvesting cotton with 
machinery. With the advent of a suc- 
cessful cotton picking machine, the only 
serious bottleneck to complete mechaniza- 
tion of cotton production will be that of 
properly thinning and weeding the cot- 
ton. 

The average cost per bale of machine- 
harvest of 2,229 bales of cotton by 12 
machines during the 1944 season was as 
follows: direct operating cost, |3.84; de- 
preciation and interest cost, $3.54; grade 
loss as a result of mechanical harvest, 
$18.40; value of cotton left in field that 
would have been picked by hand labor. 
$7.62; totals, $33.40. 

The cost of hand picking a bale of cot- 
ton on the plantations using machines at 
prevailing wages in 1944 was $2.36 per 
hundred pounds, or $37.76 per bale, with 
1600 pounds seed cotton per bale. 

The rate and extent of shift to mechan- 
ical harvest in the immediate future will 
depend upon a number of unpredictable 
influences such as the following: supply 
and cost of hand labor; alternative employ- 
ment opportunities for displaced farm la- 
bor; realization of anticipated progress in 
technical improvement of picking ma- 
chine and of cleaning devices at the gin, 
and in the breeding of varieties better 
adapted to mechanical harvest; and finally, 
the discovery of ways and means of utiliz- 
ing machines for harvesting cotton in the 
rolling upland, small farm, small field 
areas of the Southeast.

The assumption that widespread shift 
to mechanical production of cotton will 
automatically solve the income and mar- 
ket outlet problems of cotton producers 
merits critical appraisal. Past experience 
has demonstrated that production effic- 
iency gains are, for the most part, sooner 
or later passed on to consumers, or that 
whatever gains do accrue to produc- 
ers are capitalized into increased land 
values. Society would, however, gain as 
a res-ult of any efficiencies associated with 
shift to mechanization, and the competi- 
tive position of cotton as well as the cot- 
ton producer would be distinctly improv- 
ed. 

A shift to mechanization of the cotton 
harvest will leave its impact on both the 
cotton plantation and the "family size" 
farm unit. Relatively complete shift to 
mechanized operation will mean a heavy 
displacement of labor in both types of 
areas. The traditional plantation system 
as such will undergo significant changes. 
The whole institutional arrangement 
within the plantation areas will be subject 
to drastic change and the farm popula- 
tion may shrink some 60 to 75 percent. 

In the small or "family size" farm areas 
of the Cotton Belt where the pressure of 



farm population against land resources is 
equal to or greater than in the planta- 
tion areas, adjustments looking towards 
a more extensive agriculture and a dis- 
placement of farm population only slight- 
ly less than in the plantation areas may 
take place. Such adjustments would 
mean the enlargement of operating units 
with more machinery, equipment, build- 
ings, and other operating facilities and a 
greater amount of capital investment. In 
the absence of other employment oppor- 
tunities either on the farms with some 
other intensive enterprise or combination 
of enterprises or of! the farms within the 
areas, the whole range of institutional ser- 
vice patterns may undergo significant 
change within these areas. 

American cotton production must be 
made more efficient if it is to compete 
successfully in the market place with 
foreign grown cotton and synthetic and 
substitute products and at the same time 
bring the producer anything like an ade- 
quate income. The economic and social 
dislocations and adjustments as well as 
the ultimate benefits that rather complete 
mechanization of cotton production and 
harvesting will inevitably bring, must be 
shared by society as a whole.

This bulletin is a revision of bulletin number 403 which 
ivas issued ifi June 19 44-. The study reported in the prev- 
ious issue has been continued for the second year in the 
same area and expanded to include the gins located in four 
counties in Northern Mississippi. The research ivas con- 
ducted jointly by the Agricultural Economics Department 
of the Mississippi Experiment Station and the Research 
and Testing Division, Cotton and Fiber Branch, Office of 
Marketing Services, Washington, D. C. 

The authors are grateful to Mr. F. L. Gerdes, Dr. John 
W. Wright and Dr. Frank J. Welch for helpfid counsel in 
the developments throughout the conduct of the project. 
Especial credit is due Mr. W. H. Fortenberry of the United 
States Cotton Gifining Laboratory for ivork done in ap- 
praising and evaluating the gin machinery and equipmeyit. 
The help given by the district agents and the cotmty ageyits 
in the areas studied was very valuable and is appreciated. 
Of course this study tvould not have been possible without 
the records made available by the ginners in the sample 
counties. The kindness and patience displayed by these men 
made the conduct of this study a pleasure. 

Appreciation is extended to the General Education Board 
for grant of funds that made it possible for the Agricultural 
Economics Department of the Mississippi Experiment Sta- 
tion to participate in this study.

The Economics of Cotton Qin Operation 

BY 

D. Gray Miley and Arthur L. Roberts' 

Inasmuch as cotton is a raw product of the textile and other 
industries it has to compete at the point of entry into these 
industries with all other products that can be substituted for 
cotton. That is, the focal point of the serious competition fac- 
ing cotton is the price of cotton as a raw product compared with 
the price of other products both natural and synthetic that can 
be readily substituted for cotton. So long as these competing 
products can be substituted for cotton on fairly equal terms the 
price of cotton laid down at the manufacturer's door will be the 
major determining factor in the competitive process. If the 
textile, tire or other manufacturer can buy rayon and make it 
into products that the consuming public will buy in such quan- 
tities as to net him more profit than he can make from cotton 
goods, he is very likely to use rayon as a raw product. 

In this competitive process the product that is of the highest 
quality and sells for the lowest price will be in greatest demand. 
The cotton gin plays a very important part in preparing good 
quality cotton for the market. The modern cotton gin does not 
eliminate the need for careful picking and handling of the seed 
cotton, but when properly operated it can take carefully picked 
cotton and turn out an attractive bale of lint. Neither can the 
gin put into the fibers any length and quality that is not already 
there. The modern gin can preserve the length and quality 
that IS there and remove the major part of the grade iowering 
content of foreign matter. With driers and the latest cleaning 
equipment cotton that is delivered to the gin in reasonably 
good condition will turn out a good sample. 

For several years the average staple length of cotton pro- 
duced in Mississippi has been increasing in the hill areas of 
the State and decreasing in the Delta area. The entire State 
is tending toward the production of the medium staple cottons

that range from an inch to an inch and three thirty-seconds 
in length. For the hill areas, this means the production of cot- 
tons that are of a higher quality from the standpoint of staple 
length than the short cottons formerly produced. 

However, along with this increase in staple length has come 
a constant decline in average grades. This decline has been 
such that the increased value that should have come with the 
increased staple length has been almost completely offset by 
the decline in grade, and the monetary return to the producer 
has not increased as much as was expected. 

It is a known fact that the short staple cottons can be gin- 
ned more readily and a satisfactory sample can be secured 
with less care and equipment than is the case with the longer 
cottons. With the short cottons the foreign matter, which is 
one of the main grade lowering factors, sifts out quite readily 
in the ginning process and a good sample is secured without 
the use of elaborate cleaning equipment. With the longer cot- 
tons, however, the trash, leaves and other foreign matter is 
much harder to remove. 

One of the major assumptions of this study was that modern 
well equipped cotton gins would give a better grade of ginned 
cotton with all staple lengths but more especially with the long- 
er cottons, than those gins that were not so well equipped. A 
companion assumption was that the lack of proper cleaning, 
drying, and ginning equipment was partly responsible for the 
lower grades obtained with the longer cottons that are being 
grown. 

METHOD OF STUDY 

This is the second year in which the operations of cotton 
gins in four counties in central Mississippi have been studied 
rather intensively." In addition to this same group of gins, in- 
formation was obtained for the gins that operated in Marshall, 
Benton, Tippah, and Alcorn Counties. Detailed appraisals were 
made of each gin during the ginning season and were used as 
a basis for dividing the gins into groups according to their

number 403, "Economic and Cost Study of Cotton Ginning in Central Mississippi", by D.

mechanical ability to perform an efficient job of ginning as well 
as for the purpose of charging depreciation and interest in the 
cost calculations. In addition to this information, detailed cost 
records were obtained by personal contact with the ginners at 
the close of the 1944 ginning season. The grades of cotton 
ginned on each gin were obtained from the Cotton Classing 
Officer of the Office of Marketing Services, WFA, at Jackson, 
Mississippi, and Memphis, Tennessee. 

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GINS 

Complete information was obtained for 50 gins in central 
Mississippi and 42 gins in the four counties in the northern

part of the State. The location of these gins is shown in figure 
1. On the basis of the detailed appraisal information, the gins 
were divided into three groups: (1) modern gins, those equip- 
ped to do the best job of ginning; (2) average gins, those gins 
that were considered to have about average ginning equipment ; 
and (3) sub-standard gins, those gins that were poorly equip- 
ped and were in poor operating condition.'^ Some general in- 
formation about the gins in each of these groups is given in 
table 1. 

The 92 gins handled a total of 122,647 bales during the 1944 
season, or an average of 1333 bales per gin and 409 bales per 
gin stand. The 23 modern gins had an average volume of 1920 
bales per gin, while the 30 sub-standard gins handled an aver- 
age of 960 bales per gin. The average age of the modern gins 
was 8 years, as compared to an average of 18 years for the 
sub-standard group and 14 years for all 92 gins. In size, the 
modern gins had an average of 3.6 stands and the sub-standard 
group an average of 3 stands per gin. All of the modern gins 
except one had 80 saws per gin stand. Many of the older gins 
in the sub-standard group had 70-saw stands and a few had 
60-saw stands, the average for this group being 74 saws. 

The estimated replacement value of these 92 gins is slightly 
under 2 million dollars, or an average of $21,703. The present 
value, however, averages only $11,948 or 55 percent of the re- 
placement value. This means that the average gin in these 
areas has been in operation about half of its expected period 
of service. The present value of the modern gins is almost 67 
percent of the replacement value, while for the sub-standard 
group the average is 44 percent. 

The averages for the gins in the two areas were very simi- 
lar and in most instances in this report they are combined. 
Where there are significant differences the data will be shown 
for both areas. 

FINANCIAL SUMMARY 

The cost of labor is by far the most important expense item 
connected with the operation of cotton gins. (Table 2.) The 



3The appraisal work and the division of the gins into groups was done by technicians 
from the U. S. Cotton Ginning Laboratory, Stoneville, Mississippi. 



8 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 421 

labor costs during the 1944 ginning season amounted to almost 
half of the total current expenses. The very high cost of hired 
labor services emphasize the importance of using labor as ef- 
ficiently as possible. The influence of the efficient use of labor 
on the cost of operating gins will be discussed later in this 
report. 

During the past season good gin labor was not only hard to 
obtain but the wages received were fairly high compared to 
previous years. The other expense items that were of major 
importance were the cost of fuel or power, insurance, taxes, 
and maintenance and repairs. In all cases the current expenses 
were highest for the modern gins and progressively lower for 
the other two groups. The overhead expenses included salary 
for management, depreciation on the machinery and equipment, 
and interest on the investment. The depreciation was figured 
at 5 percent on the machinery and equipment and 4 percent on 
most of the buildings. In the few cases where there were all- 
steel or brick buildings, depreciation was calculated at 3 percent. 
Interest on the investment was figured at 4 percent per year

on the present value of the gin plant. As was the case with 
the current expenses, the overhead costs were highest for the 
modern gins and lowest for the gins in the sub-standard group. 
For the most part, the overhead costs do not have to be paid 
immediately. 

The salary for management is that amount which is allowed 
to pay for the services of the person who is responsible for the 
direction of the gin enterprise. In many cases the owner was 
the operator, and in addition to managing the entire business 
he did a considerable part of the actual work connected with 
operating the gin plant. In other cases the owner did most of 
the work of operating the gin and exercised full managerial sup- 
ervision of the business. In arriving at a figure to enter as a 
salary for management, an attempt was made to arrive at an 
estimate of what it would cost to hire someone at going wage 
rates to perform the managerial and other functions actually 
handled by the owner of the business. The average estimate 
for all of the gins amounted to slightly over $500 per gin. 

Depreciation is a cost that has to be met sooner or later 
if a gin operator is to continue in business for any length of 
time. If reserves for taking care of the depreciation are not 
set aside currently, the present gin plant will go out of exist- 
ence when the machinery and equipment is worn out. The 
owners of gins can take the amount alloted for depreciation 
and "live it up" if they care to, but if a majority of the oper- 
ators of gins do not set aside sufficient funds to replace their 
plants the entire ginning industry will gradually go down. This 
cost of depreciation is, therefore, one that has to be met as the 
ginning industry goes along if it is to maintain itself over any 
period of time and perform a satisfactory service. 

The item of interest on the investment is another cost that 
has to be met if capital is to continue to flow into the ginning 
industry in sufficient quantities to maintain the industry at its 
present level. As has already been pointed out, the amount of 
capital invested in gin plants is fairly high in comparison to 
the amount of time the facilities are used during any one season. 
Ginners or other investors do not put capital into gin plants 
unless there is an opportunity to realize at least as much re- 
turn as they could realize from what would be considered ordi- 



10 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 421 

narily safe investments. In other words, if a person can derive 
3 percent interest on government bonds he is not Hkely to put 
his money in a somewhat risky enterprise that promises to 
earn no more than 3 percent. From this standpoint, in order to 
have capital continue to flow into the ginning industry in suf- 
ficient quantities to maintain the industry at its present level, 
it is necessary that the ginning industry offer at least as good 
an opportunity as other investment possibilities. For the 88 
gins included in this study the average interest on investment 
was $476. 

The combined overhead costs amounted to $1557 for all of 
the gins. When the overhead and current expenses are com- 
bined, the average gin had a total cost of $4270 during the 1944 
season. This is about $700 higher than the average cost for 
the 43 gins studied in 1943. Practically all items of expense 
were higher during the 1944 season than for the previous year. 
These higher costs, however, were more than completely offset 
by increased income from performing the ginning service. The 
major part of this increase in income was due to the increased 
amount of cotton ginned. The average gin in 1944 had a volume 
of 1333 bales, compared with an average of 1053 bales for the 
previous season. 

After allowing for all current expenses, salary for manage- 
ment, depreciation, and interest on the investment, the average 
gin in 1944 returned a net profit of $491 on the ginning opera- 
tion. The modern gins had a net profit of $1227 whereas, the 
sub-standard gins had a profit of only $7.00. In arriving at 
these net profit figures on the ginning operation, the entire 
costs of operating the business were charged against the income 
received from the performance of the ginning service. 

In addition, the ginners had what they made on handling 
cottonseed and bagging and ties. The handling of seed was 
quite profitable during the past season and the average ginner 
made $1893 net income from handling cottonseed. Almost all 
ginners make a net income of around $0.25 per bale for bagging 
and ties. This item amounted to an average of $317 per gin. 
When all of these items were combined, the average gin oper- 
ator had a net profit of $2701 during the 1944 season. It 
should be emphasized that this amount of profit was made after

allowing a reasonable salary for management, depreciation on 
the gin plant, and 4 percent interest on the investment. For the 
modern gins the net profit amounted to $4327 and for the sub- 
standard gins the profit was $1497. 

It is readily observed from this summary that even though 
almost all items of expense were higher in 1944 than they had 
been previously, the income also was considerably higher and 
resulted in all groups of gins returning a reasonable profit for 
the gin operations of this season. 

COST AND INCOME PER BALE 

The average cost for ginning a bale of cotton was $3.10. 
(Table 3.) The average income for performing the ginning 
service was $3.46 per bale, thus leaving a net profit of $0.36 
per bale on the ginning operation. In addition to the profit 
made on the ginning operation, the average gin operator had a 
net income of $1.37 per bale from cottonseed and made $0.23 
per bale from bagging and ties. When these three items of

income are combined, the average operator received a net profit 
of $1.96 for each bale ginned during the 1944 season. The av- 
erage net profit for the 43 gins included in the study during 
the 1943 season was $1.23 per bale. The net profit during 1944 
ranged from $2.25 per bale for the modern gins to $1.46 per 
bale for the sub-standard gins. 

It is interesting to note that the fees charged for perform- 
ing the ginning services were somewhat higher for the modern 
gins than for those in the sub-standard group. On the other 
hand the average cost for performing the ginning services was 
lowest for the modern gins, thus leaving a net profit of $0.64 
per bale for the modern gins and only $0.01 per bale for the 
sub-standard gins. Apparently the modern gins were able to 
charge a higher rate for the ginning service and still maintain 
a much higher average volume than the sub-standard gins even 
though the latter group charged a lower rate for this service. 
This is contrary to the situation found in the Central Area dur- 
ing the previous season when the sub-standard gins charged a 
little higher rate for the ginning service than the more modern 
gins. For the entire group of gins during the 1944 season, the 
average current expense was $1.97 per bale. Almost 50 percent 
of the current expenses was made up of labor costs. Fuel or 
power costs accounted for about 12 percent of the current ex- 
penses, and maintenance and repairs about 15 percent. The re- 
maining costs were made up of insurance, taxes, and minor mis- 
cellaneous items. 

The total overhead costs amounted to $1.13 per bale. In 
other words, of the total cost of $3.10 for performing the gin- 
ning service, the overhead costs were 36 percent and the cur- 
rent expenses 64 percent of the total. Thus as has already 
been emphasized, the overhead charges necessary to manage 
and take care of the investment in a gin plant constitute a con- 
siderable proportion of the total costs. 

LABOR, FUEL AND POWER REQUIREMENTS FOR 

GINNING 

It required an average of 2.9 hours of man labor, including 
the time of the manager, to gin a bale of cotton during the 
1944 season. (Table 4.) The modern gins used 2.6 hours per 



THE ECONOMICS OF COTTON GIN OPERATION 



13 



bale and to do the same job required an average of 3.3 hours 
for the sub-standard gins. 

There were 40 gins that used Diesel engines as a source of 
power. These engines used an average of 1.6 gallons of Diesel 
fuel per bale ginned. The modern gins used an average of 1.4 
gallons per bale while at the same time the sub-standard group 
used 1.8 gallons. 

The 15 gins that used electric power consumed an average 
of 19 kilowatt hours per bale of cotton ginned. Here too the 
modern gins consumed the smaller quantity, the average for 
this group being 17.2 kilowatt hours as compared with 25.1 for 
the sub-standard group. Fourteen of the 15 electrically operat- 
ed gins used in this analysis were in the North Mississippi Area 
where TVA power is available. 

There were 10 other fuel burning engines that used either 
tractor fuel or fuel oil. There were not sufficient numbers of

these to give reliable averages for all the groups but the com- 
bined average was 3.3 gallons of fuel per bale ginned. 

Power plants that used gasoline for fuel were used in 9 gins, 
all of which were in the Central Mississippi Area. These gins 
burned an average of 3.1 gallons of gasoline for each bale 
ginned. 

The average quantities of fuel and the average hours of labor 
required to operate cotton gins with the same type of equipment 
do not vary greatly from year to year. Consequently, the aver- 
age figures for labor and fuel requirements can be used for sev- 
eral years to make estimates of the cost of operating gins. 

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE GINNING INCOME 

Size and Volume 

As was pointed out earlier in this report the cotton gin is 
used for only a short period out of each year. Because of the 
relatively high investment in plant and equipment and this short 
period of use, it is necessary that a gin plant be operated ef- 
ficiently and at near capacity throughout the ginning season 
if a reasonable return is to be made from the operation. The 
importance of this fact is shown in table 5 where the gins have 
been grouped by size, as measured by number of stands, and 
by volume in terms of bales ginned. 

Small two-stand gins that ginned less than 600 bales during 
the season lost an average of $1.15 for every bale ginned. On 
the other hand, the two-stand gins that ginned over 900 bales 
made a net income of $0.58 for each bale ginned. As the volume 
increased the total cost per bale as well as the hours of labor 
per bale declined significantly. Because of the relatively large 
overhead cost involved, small gins have difficulty making any 
profit with a volume that runs less than 500 bales per gin stand. 

The relationship for three-stand gins was the same as for the 
smaller gins. Those that ginned less than 1000 bales had high 
average costs, substantial average losses, and used a large 
amount of labor per bale. On the other hand the gins that 
handled over 1400 bales made an average net income of $0.81 
per bale. The three-stand gins had to have an average of about

450 bales per stand before they returned an average net in- 
come. The additional overhead cost necessary to operate a 
three-stand gin over that which is required for a two-stand gin 
is not large enough to require the same number of bales per 
stand for a ''break even" volume. 

The same relationship between volume, cost, and income holds 
true for the large gins. That is, the four-stand gins with large 
volumes had lower costs per bale, used less labor per bale, and 
made more profit than the low volume gins. The ''break even" 
volume for these larger gins was around 400 bales per gin 
stand. 

The general relationship of volume of ginnings and the total 
cost per bale is shown in figure 2. Other factors, such as labor 
efficiency, and type and condition of the machinery and power 
plant, cause some scatter of the individual gins around the 
general trend line but there can be little question about the 
fact that the cost of ginning declines as the volume increases. 
The decline is very sharp until a volume of around 1000 bales 
is reached. From about 1000 to around 2000 the decline con- 
tinues downward but at a decreasing rate. Above 2000 bales 



16 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 421 



the costs tended to average about the same. This may be due 
to the fact that there were not enough gins with high volumes 
to set a definite trend line or it may be that additional econ- 
omies are hard to realize after a volume of around 2000 bales 
is reached with a four-stand gin. 

The operation of a gin of any size requires a crew that is 
governed by the size of the gin. This basic or skeleton crew 
usually has to be on hand during most of the ginning season. 
Therefore, the cost of this crew, as well as the interest and de- 
preciation on the gin plant, go on whether 500 or 2000 bales 
are handled. But if a four-stand gin has around 2000 to 2500 
bales to gin during a normal season the labor and the equipment 
can be used to capacity for the major part of the season. If 
a bale can be ginned every 15 minutes during a 10-hour day, 
40 bales can be ginned per day. At this rate 2000 bales would 
give 50 full 10-hour days at near capacity. When above this 
amount is handled it means that the labor has to be worked 
overtime or a night crew has to be employed. Because of these 
factors the further reduction of the average per bale costs be-

THE ECONOMICS OF COTTON GIN OPERATION 17 

comes more and more difficult after a volume of 2000 to 2500 
bales is reached for a four-stand gin. Very likely the costs can 
be reduced still more with larger gins serving larger territories 
which furnish proportionately larger volumes. The same re- 
sult could be brought about if the ginning season could be ex- 
tended to cover a longer period. It might be economically pos- 
sible for some of the larger gins to provide storage space for 
some of the seed cotton during the peak harvesting period and 
gin it during slack periods. The cost of providing such storage 
would have to be low enough to equal the reduced cost brought 
about by the more efficient operation, after allowing for the 
cost of present methods of storage, or the total cost of ginning 
might be increased. In other words, cotton has to be stored 
somewhere and it may be that a certain amount of storage 
could be provided at the gin at low enough cost to bring about 
economies in the performance of the ginning service. Such 
storage would have to be constructed so that the cotton or the 
seed would not deteriorate and would have to be situated so 
that the cotton could be handled by the suction system of the 
gin plant. Perhaps one of the greatest drawbacks to such a 
plan would be the reluctance of producers to wait for any length 
of time to get their cotton ginned. 

Use of Labor 

The efficient use of the labor that is employed to run the 
gin plant is very important if a profit is to be made on the op- 
eration. One of the most important ways to increase labor ef- 
fiency is to be sure of enough volume to keep the force fully 
employed. But for gins that have about the same volume of 
ginnings some use nearly twice as much labor as others. (See 
table 6.) For example, 8 gins that had a volume of less than 
1000 bales used an average of 2.5 hours of labor per bale gin- 
ned, while 8 other gins in the same volume group used an 
average of 5.5 hours of labor for each bale ginned. The former 
group had an average net profit of $0.09 per bale and the lat- 
ter a net loss of $2.60 for every bale ginned. Of course not all 
this loss was due to the inefficient use of labor, but there can 
be little question that it was a major factor in increasing the 
cost of operation and thus reducing the profits.

The group of gins that averaged about 1250 bales also had 
considerable variation in the amount of labor used. Those that 
used an average of 2.5 hours of labor per bale had a net profit 
of $0.55 for each bale ginned. On the other hand, those gins 
with about the same volume but which used 4.1 hours of labor 
per bale had a net loss of $0.08 for each bale ginned. The same 
relationship held for the gins that averaged ginning around 
2000 bales. Those that used the least labor per bale made a net 
profit of $1.44 for each bale ginned; whereas, those using the 
highest amount of labor had a net profit of only $0.34 per bale. 
The economics that go with the larger volumes can be reduced 
materially by the inefficient use of labor. 

One of the big obstacles of the ginning business is that it 
furnishes employment for only a short period of the year. 
Consequently the labor has to be brought in from farms or 
other places of employment to be used temporarily in the op- 



THE ECONOMICS OF COTTON GIN OPERATION 



19 



eration of the gin. Under these conditions it is always diffi- 
cult to secure and keep competent labor; this makes it all the 
more important that the ginner hire only the amount of help 
needed when it is needed and if possible, use the same workers 
year after year so they can be trained to do their particular job 
effectively. 

Power Costs 

The decision as to what type of power to use in a gin plant 
may determine the future financial success of the operation. 
It has already been pointed out that small gins with low vol- 
umes almost always lose money. This is especially true for 
small gins that have heavy investments in their power plants. 
The overhead becomes entirely too burdensome for the smaller 
gins to carry when they have a large amount of capital invest- 
ed in a power plant. 

Diesel type power was used in 41 of the gins included in 
this study. (Table 7.) Four of these were two-stand gins, 
and they had an average net loss of $0.23 per bale ginned. The 
rather low fuel cost of $0.20 per bale was offset by the relative- 
ly high cost of $0.26 per bale for depreciation and interest on 
the investment in the power plant. The larger Diesel powered 
gins with proportionately higher volumes had progressively 
lower fuel as well as interest and depreciation costs. The four- 
stand Diesel operated gins with an average volume of around 
1900 bales used only $0.18 worth of fuel per bale. The interest 
and depreciation charge was $0.16, making an average cost of 
$0.34 per bale for the large gins that used Diesel power. The 
average power cost for the Diesel operated gins was $0.18 per 
bale for fuel and $0.20 for interest and depreciation or a total 
of $0.38 for each bale ginned. 

The use of electric power was limited almost entirely to the 
North Mississippi Area where TVA power is available. The 19 
gins using electric pov/er had almost the same average volume 
as the Diesel powered gins and had an average power cost of 
$0.40 per bale and an interest and depreciation cost of $0.07 
making a total of $0.47 per bale. However, the total cost was 
lower and the profit per bale higher for the electrically operat-

ed gins than for the gins operated by Diesel power. Electric 
power cost more per bale than did Diesel fuel, but the invest- 
ment in the average electric motor was only about one-third 
as much as in the Diesel type motors. A further factor to 
consider is the amount of labor required to operate a Diesel 
type motor as compared with an electric motor. The large 
Diesel type engines require a considerable amount of engineer- 
ing ability and supervision for the most efficient operation. 
On the other hand, the electric motors require very little more 
than the ability to turn a switch. This difference in labor re- 



THE ECONOMICS OF COTTON GIN OPERATION 



21 



quirements was one of the main factors accounting for the low- 
er total costs of the electrically powered gins. 

The 10 gins that used gasoline engines had an average cost 
of $0.43 per bale for gasoline and $0.12 for interest and de- 
preciation on the power plant making a total cost of $0.55 per 
bale. The average investment in gasoline engines was slightly 
over $1500 per gin. The gins using gasoline type of power 
had a lower total cost per bale than any of the other groups. 
This lower cost was accomplished with a smaller volume than 
either the electric or Diesel power groups. No doubt there are 
other factors that accounted for the favorable showing of these 
gasoline powered gins, but all the studies made so far indicate 
that the smaller gins with somewhere near average volumes 
have a greater chance of showing a profit when they make ef- 
ficient use of a good gasoline engine. 

The group of 7 gins that used tractor fuel or fuel oil had a 
fairly low average volume of 744 bales per gin. This low 
volume probably was the major factor contributing to the rath- 
er substantial loss shown for this group. The average cost of 
fuel was $0.32 per bale and for interest and depreciation $0.14, 
making a total cost for the other fuel burners of $0.56 per 
bale. 

The final group shows six gins that use steam power. The 
average cost for steam power was higher than for any of the 
other groups. The major item of cost was fuel for the burners. 
The cost of wood and other fuel for steam engines has been 
very high during the war period. The average cost of fuel 
for the six gins was $0.56 per bale. On the other hand, interest 
and depreciation charges were lower than for any of the other 
groups, averaging only $0.06 per bale. The total per bale cost 
for the steam powered gins was $0.62. The two large four- 
stand gins using steam power compared favorably with the 
same size gins in the other groups in both cost and profit per 
bale. A major factor to be considered in the use of steam pow- 
er is that the service of a full time fireman or engineer is re- 
quired for the efficient operation of the power plant. To have 
a complete basis for comparison, the services of such a person 
would have to be added to the actual power costs. The steam 



2 2 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 421 

engines that are still in use are all old and will no doubt be 
replaced by other types as soon as they are no longer service- 
able. Steam powered gins have been decreasing at a rapid rate 
during recent years. 

The Use of Capital 

It is almost impossible for small gins with relatively high 
capital investments to return a net profit on the ginning op- 
eration. (Table 8.) In order to show the influence of the ef- 
ficient use of capital on income, an attempt was made to elimi- 
nate at least part of the influence of the volume of ginnings. 
This was accomplished by sorting the gins into groups accord-

capital invested per bale of cotton ginned. The gins that had 
less than 1000 bales and had an average investment of over 
$14 for each bale ginned, had a net loss of $2.35 per bale. On 
the other hand, the gins that had less than 1000 bales but which

had less than $9.00 invested for each bale ginned, succeeded in 
making a small net profit. Part of this difference was prob- 
ably accounted for by the fact that the sorting procedure used 
did not result in getting gins in each group with the same av- 
erage volume. In the second group, however, the volume was 
about the same for each of the sub-groups. In this case the 
gins that had less than $8.50 invested for each bale ginned 
made a net profit of $0.73 per bale, whereas those that had 
over $10.00 invested for each bale ginned made only $0.05 
per bale. 

In the group with the highest volume, the relationship was 
very much the same. In this case, however, each group of gins 
returned a net profit but the group with the smallest amount 
invested for each bale ginned made the highest average profit. 

It will be observed that in each group shown the gins with 
the highest investment per bale had the highest total invest- 
ment per gin and those with the lowest investment per bale 
had the smallest total investment per gin ; also in each case, 
the gins with the lowest investment per bale always had the 
lowest total cost per bale. This was true for every volume 
group. As the usual thing, the gins with the highest invest- 
ment are the newer, more modern gin plants. From this stand- 
point they are better equipped to do an efficient job of gin- 
ning than those with small investments. However, from the 
standpoint of making a return from the ginning enterprise, the 
fact that a person has a new, modern gin plant with a high 
capital investment does not in any way insure the financial 
success of the enterprise. The success, and consequently the 
eventual establishment, of large, modern gin plants will be 
determined very largely by the ability of these plants to secure 
sufficient volume to insure the financial success of the operation. 

Perhaps one of the major reasons why the majority of cotton 
gins in the Hill Areas of Mississippi have not put in modern 
drying, cleaning and other equipment is the fact that their 
volumes are not sufficient to return income enough to pay for 
the necessary capital to make these improvements.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE COTTON QUALITY 

Cotton growers can maintain the quality of cotton they pro- 
duce by adopting improved methods of harvesting, handling, 
and by selecting gins adequately equipped and efficiently man- 
aged. During the past decade farmers have begun to realize 
premiums for high grade cotton. This, perhaps, is due largely 
to closer attention to selection of improved varieties, better har- 
vesting and ginning methods, and market values of the various 
grades of cotton produced. 

Measures of Cotton Quality 

Foreign matter content, color, and ginning preparation are 
the major factors of grade and they all contribute to the spin- 
ning utility of cotton lint. Ginning preparation and the aver- 
age value of lint per pound are two measures of ginning 
quality used in this analysis of the performance of the three 
groups of gins in the study. 

Preparation* is a term used to describe the degree of smooth- 
ness or the relative napiness or neppiness of ginned lint. Al- 
though the condition of seed cotton when ginned has an im- 
portant effect on preparation, the manner in which it is ginned 
and the condition of ginning equipment frequently determine 
whether the preparation of lint is to be smooth or rough. 

All gins used in the study were selected in areas of Missis- 
sippi where cotton varieties, soil, climatic conditions, tillage 
and harvesting methods, and marketing practices are unusually 
uniform. It has, therefore, been assumed that the principal 
differences in ginning preparation and in average value of lint 
cotton per pound would be the result of differences in the ade- 
quacy and condition of ginning machinery. 

Ginning Performance Based on Official Classification 

Since this part of the study is dependent on the official class- 
ification of samples submitted from each gin, the number of 
gins used varies slightly from the number used in the cost

ment of Agriculture, Miscellaneous publication No. 310, 54 pp., illus., 1938.

analysis section. All gins used in this analysis, however, were 
used in that section. 

Of the 73 gins included in this section of the study, 21 were 
classified as modern, 30 as average, and 22 as sub-standard. 
This grouping was made on the basis of the condition and ade- 
quacy of machinery in the gins. It is recognized, however, that 
method of operation of gin equipment may in some cases null- 
ify the good ginning job expected from a gin having modern 
gin machinery. 

Cotton in Mississippi at the beginning of the 1944 season was 
somewhat green and evidently contained too much moisture 
for best ginning results. This condition usually results in an 
increase in the proportion of roughly ginned cotton. Tests have 
shown that driers are an effective factor in reducing rough 
preparation for cotton containing an excessive amount of moist- 
ure. Only two of the gins included in the study were equipped 
with driers for the proper conditioning of seed cotton for gin- 
ning. 



A comparison of rough preparation for gins equipped with 
driers and those not so equipped is shown in table 9. Gins 
using driers had only 3.7 percent rough preparation. Had all 
gins in Mississippi been equipped with driers during the season, 
the benefits to cotton growers could have meant many thous- 
ands of dollars on the basis of these results. 

Cotton driers, however, are comparatively expensive equip- 
ment and are usually found only in the strictly modern gins. 
Ginners whose volume of ginning is small usually find that the 
expense of driers is prohibitive and the only alternative for

the grower is to harvest his cotton only when it is dry or pat- 
ronize gins having this improved equipment. 

Based on preliminary figures of the Office of Marketing Serv- 
ices, approximately 200,000 equivalent 500 pound bales of the 
1944 cotton crop in Mississippi was reduced one or more grades 
because of rough ginning. It is believed that a major portion 
of this reduction in grade was a result of ginning cotton con- 
taining excessive moisture. Some of the reductions in grade 
were likely caused by too fast feeding of cotton to the gin stands 
as will be shown in a later table. 

Factors of Gin Operation Influencing Ginning Preparation 

In -table 10 is set forth some factors of gin operation that 
have an important influence on ginning preparation. These are 
(1) density of seed roll, (2) saw speed, (3) condition of saws 
and (4) condition of ribs. 

One-third of the modern gins studied ginned with loose seed 
rolls. While 27 percent and 23 percent of the average and sub-

standard gins, respectively, operated with loose seed rolls. Two- 
thirds of the modern gins operated with medium seed rolls 
and 70 percent and 72 percent of the average and sub-standard 
gins, respectively, operated in this manner. None of the mod- 
ern gins operated with tight seed rolls while a small percent of 
both the average and sub-standard gins operated with tight 
seed rolls. 

It is imperative that gins using saw speeds of 600 revolutions- 
per-minute and above maintain loose seed rolls and use prop- 
er seed board settings if a good job of ginning is to be done. 
This speed coupled with the tight seed rolls causes consider- 
able damage to cotton lint. 

Two-thirds of the modern gins used saw speeds of 600 rev- 
olutions-per-minute and above and about the same proportion of 
the other two groups of gins used speeds of 400 to 599. 

A major proportion of the modern gins maintained both saws 
and ribs in good condition. The average sub-standard gins had 
a considerable proportion of both saws and ribs in fair to poor 
condition. These factors of gin operation no doubt had quite 
an influence on the results of ginning as shown in the follow- 
ing tables.^ 

Experiments have shown that as seed rolls are allowed to ap- 
proach a medium and tight condition, short fibers are pulled 
from the seed. This results in a slightly higher percentage of 
lint being produced because a larger proportion of the short 
fiber is removed from the seed. But manufacturing waste is 
higher for such cotton and staple length may be reduced be- 
cause of greater irregularity in fiber length. These practices 
in ginning may also increase the content of motes and seed 
fragments in the ginned lint. This, of necessity, brings about 
a reduction in the class of cotton and, therefore, a loss in grade 
to the farmer. The increase in lint turnout does not ordinarily 
offset the loss resulting from the reduction in grade. 

Lint Turnout 

It is not surprising that, as shown in table 11, the lint per- 
centage turnout for the three groups of gins is slightly higher

for the sub-standard gins. The percentages being 38.1, 38.3 
and 39.1 for the modern, average, and sub-standard gins, re- 
spectively. These percentages of Hnt turnout are significant 
since all gins having average staple lengths of less than one 
inch were excluded in order that the varieties involved would 
be almost in exact proportion for each gin group.^ As a usual 
practice modern gins ginned with less dense seed rolls than 
did either the average or sub-standard gins.

Age of Gins as a Factor Influencing Ginning Preparation 

Since age and use bring about worn and outmoded machinery, 
a comparison of ginning preparation was made for gins built 
during the period 1937 through 1944 and for gins built prior to 
1937, table 12. This grouping of gins was made without re- 
gard to whether the gins had been placed in modern, average, 
and sub-standard groups, but was made purely according to the 
age of the gins. However, about three-fourths of the gins 
shown were built during the period 1937 through 1944 and were 
from the modern group. 

Age seems to have a definite influence on ginning prepara- 
tion as the gins built during and since 1937 show only 4.9 per- 
cent rough preparation while those built prior to 1937 aver- 
age 7.2 percent rough ginned cotton. The gins built since 
1937 were assumed to have installed new equipment. Some of

the gins placed in the building prior to 1937 have been over- 
hauled in recent years but are still considered to be inadequate 
in a number of respects. 

Distribution of Gins According to Rough Preparation 

Rough preparation for gins used in the study ranged from 
zero to about 21 percent. (Table 13.) Only two gins, however, 
had rough preparation in excess of 18 percent. These gins 
were in the sub-standard group. Approximately 90 percent of 
the modern gins were in that group having less than 9 percent 
rough preparation. The average and sub-standard groups each 
had 73 percent of the gins in this preparation range. Those 
gins having from 9 to 17.9 percent of rough preparation com- 
posed 10 percent, 27 percent, and 18 percent, respectively, of 
modern, average, and sub-standard gins.

In order to compare the effect of condition of gin saws and 
ribs on ginning preparation, gins submitting samples from 50 
percent or more of the bales ginned during the 1944 season, 
were divided into two groups according to condition of saws and 
ribs. Those gins having both saws and ribs in good condition 
had 5.4 percent rough preparation. Gins with either or both 
saws and ribs in fair to poor condition had 7.3 percent rough 
preparation. 

The average value of lint per pound was 22.22 cents for the 
gins having saws and ribs in good condition and 22.13 cents 
per pound for gins having saws and ribs in fair to poor condi- 
tion, table 14.

Grade index, average staple length and the proportion of

gins were divided without regard to their original grouping. 
Fifteen gins had overhead cleaners and 48 lacked this type of 
equipment. The advantages for overhead cleaners as here 
shown are almost nil.

The gins using overhead cleaners produced a one-tenth of one

roughly ginned cotton, than did gins having no overhead clean- 
ers. The difference in average staple length for the two groups 
of gins was only one-tenth of one thirty-second inch. 

Should the cotton growers in the areas of Mississippi covered 
by this study continue to pick their cotton by hand, it seems 
that driers could be more profitably used than overhead clean- 
ers. (By overhead cleaners is meant auxiliary cleaners ahead

mechanical harvesting of cotton continue, overhead cleaners are 
likely to become an essential part of the most complete ginning 
setup. 

SUMMARY 

Cotton is a raw product of the textile and other industries 
and consequently has to compete with other fibers that can be 
substituted for cotton at the point of entry into these indus- 
tries. In this competitive process, the product that is of the 
highest quality and can be had at the lowest price will be in 
greatest demand. 

The cotton gin plays an important part in preparing and con- 
ditioning cotton for its place in the competitive picture. This 
study was designed to show the influence of the type and con- 
dition of gin machinery and equipment on the cost and effi- 
ciency of operating gins as well as the grade of the ginned lint. 

Complete cost and grade information was obtained from 50 
gins in 4 counties in central Mississippi and 42 gins in 4 
counties in north Mississippi. On the basis of detailed ap- 
praisal information, all gins were grouped according to whether 
they were modern, average, or sub-standard in the type and 
condition of gin machinery and equipment. 

The 92 gins handled a total of 122,647 bales during the 1944 
season, or an average of 1,333 bales per gin. The 23 modern 
gins had an average volume of 1,926 bales per gin as compared 
to an average of 960 for the 30 sub-standard gins. The aver- 
age age of the modern gins was 8 years as compared to an 
average of 18 years for the sub-standard group. The estimated 
replacement value of the 92 gins is slightly under 2 million 
dollars or an average of $21,703 per gin. The present value, 
however, averaged only $11,948 or 55 percent of the replace- 
ment value. 

After allowing for all current expenses, • salary for manage- 
ment, depreciation, and interest on the investment, the average 
gin in 1944 returned a net profit of $491 on the ginning opera- 
tion. For the modern gins the profit was $1,227 and for the 
sub-standard group the average was only $7.00. In addition, 



32 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 421 



all ginners had the profit from the handling of cottonseed and 
bagging and ties which amounted to an average of $1,893 and 
$317 respectively. When all items were included, the modern 
gins had a total net profit of $4,327 and the sub-standard gins 
a profit of $1,497. 

The average cost of ginning a bale of cotton was $3.10. The 
average gin income was $3.46 per bale, thus leaving a net profit 
of $0.36 per bale. The net profit from the handling of seed 
and bagging and ties increased the average total net profit to 
$1.96 per bale for the 1944 season. The range in total net 
profit was from an average of $2.25 per bale for modern gins 
to $1.46 per bale for sub-standard gins. 

It required an average of 2.9 hours of man labor to gin each 
bale of cotton. The 40 gins that used Diesel engines as a source 
of power used an average of 1.6 gallons of Diesel fuel per bale. 
Electrically powered gins used 19 kilowatt hours of electricity 
for each bale. Ten other fuel burners used 3.3 gallons of trac- 
tor fuel or fuel oil per bale while 9 gasoline powered gins used 
3.1 gallons of gasoline for each bale. 

The major factors that influenced ginning income were size 
and volume, use of labor and power, and the use of capital. 
All sizes of gins that had large volumes and made efficient use 
of their labor, power, and capital returned a reasonable net 
profit. As usual, efficient large gins with a large volume re- 
turned a larger profit than smaller gins. To insure enough 
income to at least break even, small 2-stand gins needed about 
500 bales per gin stand, 3-stand gins at least 450 bales per 
stand and 4-stand gins at least 400 bales per stand. However, 
this volume alone did not insure the financial success of every 
individual gin, but volume plus the efficient use of labor, pow- 
er and capital, almost always insured the financial success of 
the ginning operation. 

Cotton driers have a decided effect on ginning preparation. 
Those gins using driers had 3.7 percent rough preparation as 
compared with 6.8 percent rough preparation for gins not hav- 
ing driers. 

Little difference existed in the density of seed rolls main- 
tained by the various groups of gins. However, those gins us- 



THE ECONOMICS OF COTTON GIN OPERATION 



33 



ing tight seed rolls were all in the average and sub-standard 
groups. Modern gins maintained considerably higher saw 
speeds than did either the average or sub-standard groups. 
Saws and ribs on the modern gins were in good to fair condition, 
while several of the average and sub-standard gins had saws 
and ribs in poor condition. 

Gins built during the period, 1937 to 1944, had 4.9 of their 
samples reduced one or more grades. But, gins built prior to 
1937 had 7.2 percent of their samples reduced one or more 
grades because of rough ginning. Age of gin, therefore, seems 
to have had considerable influence on the quality of cotton 
turned out. 

The average value of lint turned out by gins having both saws 
and ribs in good condition was 22.22 cents per pound. That 
turned out by gins having either or both saws and ribs in fair 
to poor condition had an average of 22.13 cents per pound.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT 



This is the first of a series of studies designed to provide 
a general picture of dairying in Mississippi, to point out 
problems in milk production and processing, and to provide 
factual information that should aid in the solution of these 
problems. 

The author is grateful to F. H. Herzer, Head, Department 
of Dairy Manufacturing, Mississippi State College, and L. 
A. Higgins, Dairy Specialist, Mississippi Extension Service, 
for making helpful suggestions, providing useful informa- 
tion, and reading the manuscript.

Development of the Dairy 
Industry in Mississippi 

By D. W. PARVIN 

Associate Agricultural Economist 

Over a long period of years, agricultural leaders of Missis- 
sippi have emphasized the need for increasing dairying within 
the State. This emphasis has been based partially on certain 
natural advantages and partially on the danger of placing too 
much emphasis on cotton as the almost exclusive cash crop in 
most sections of the State. The prospective unfavorable post- 
war outlook for cotton gives added emphasis to the need for re- 
examining and re-emphasizing the possibility of and need for 
expanding dairy production in those areas that have natural 
advantages in milk production. 

This study is designed to give perspective to the possibility 
of expanding dairy production in Mississippi. No attempt was 
made to derive or work out possible solutions for problems con- 
fronting the dairy industry; however, data have been provided 
that should point the way to the solution of these problems 
by trained dairy production and marketing men. 

Source of Data 

The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce 
has on file annual reports of all dairy plants since 1929 and 
annual reports of manufacturing plants only, since 1919. These 
individual plant reports give the amount of milk and butterfat 
purchased from producers and the kind and amount of dairy 
products manufactured. The greater part of the data used in 
this study were obtained from these reports. 

The annual reports filed at Jackson do not give the complete 
picture of commercial dairying in Mississippi, because all dairy- 
men who retail their own milk and some of the smaller fluid 
milk plants do not file reports. In addition, the milk picked 
up on milk routes and hauled to fluid milk plants outside the 



6 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 

State does not appear in these reports. This means, of course, 
that fluid milk sales appear less . important than they really 
are; however, for purposes of this report, this is not a limiting 
factor because this study is concerned primarily with the dairy 
manufacturing industry. 

The number of manufacturing plants in operation and the 
amount of dairy products manufactured each year prior to 1919, 
as well as the date of opening of the early manufacturing 
plants, were obtained from the annual reports of the Dairy 
Specialist of the Mississippi Extension Service. Additional in- 
formation was obtained from manufacturing plants, the United 
States Census, and various divisions of the U. S. Department 
of Agriculture. 

Definition of Terms 

Manufacturing plants: creameries, cheese plants, condenser- 
ies, and concentrated by-products plants. All plants manufac- 
turing butter, cheese, and condensed milk were counted as sep- 
arate plants even though they were operated in the same build- 
ing in a few instances. Concentrated by-products plants were 
not considered as separate plants unless the by-products man- 
ufactured made up a predominate part of all products manu- 
factured. 

Dairy plants: manufacturing plants plus fluid milk and ice 
cream plants. 

Butterfat manufactured: butterfat manufactured into butter, 
cheese, and condensed milk. 

Condensery: plants producing condensed or evaporated whole 
milk. Condensed milk is the term used to designate both con- 
densed and evaporated whole milk. 

Fluid milk: includes milk and sweet cream sold for direct 
consumption. 

DAIRY FARMING IN MISSISSIPPI 

Dairying as a major farm enterprise is relatively undevel- 
oped in Mississippi as compared to some of the more concen- 
trated dairy areas of the United States. For example, Mis- 
sissippi has less than one-half as many milk cows per square 
mile as the middle Atlantic and the east north central states; 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 7 

milk produced per farm amounts to only about one-fifth that 
of the above states ; and only about one-third the milk produced 
in Mississippi is sold as whole milk or cream, as compared to 
more than eight-tenths of the milk produced in the states men- 
tioned above. See table 1. 

From 1899 to 1939, Mississippi's relative position in the pro- 
duction of milk in the United States remained about the same. 
In 1899, Mississippi ranked 23rd among the 48 states in the 
amount of milk produced, and produced 1.34 percent of all the 
milk in the United States; by 1939, Mississippi ranked 24th in 
milk production and produced 1.31 percent of all milk produc- 
ed, a slight deterioration of position on both counts. However, 
as far as milk sales are concerned, Mississippi's relative posi- 
tion has improved considerably. In 1939, Mississippi ranked 
25th in the amount of milk sold, and sold 0.73 percent of all 
the milk sold in the United States, as compared to a rank of 
41 in the amount of milk sold and 0.10 percent of total United 
States milk sales in 1899. See table 2. 

With regard to their relative contributions to farm income, 
dairy products have doubled in importance in Mississippi since 
the middle twenties. The proportion of cash farm income, ex- 
cluding government payments, that comes from the sale of 
dairy products increased from 3.3 percent for the period 1924- 
28 to 7.4 percent for the period 1937-39, then decreased slight- 
ly to 6.0 percent for the period 1942-44.

The number of milk cows and heifers, 2 years old and over, 
on farms as of January 1 decreased each year from 475,000 
in 1920 to 408,000 in 1927, then increased each year to 595,000 
head in 1935. This is an increase of 120,000 head or 26 per- 
cent over 1920. After 1935, the number on farms declined 
each year until 1941 when 525,000 head were reported. Under 
the impetus of the war the number of milk cows and heifers 
on farms increased rapidly to 591,000 in 1944, only slightly less 
than the peak of 595,000 head in 1935. See table 3. 

In 1939, 34.1 percent of the farms in Mississippi reported 
no milk cows ; 60.3 percent reported from 1 to 4 milk cows, and 
only 5.6 percent reported 5 or more milk cows. This last 
group of farms had 34.5 percent of milk cows in Mississippi 
and produced 36.5 percent of all milk in the State. From a 
commercial standpoint this group is even more important be- 
cause they sold 86.5 percent of milk and 72.6 percent of the 
cream marketed in the State. Thus it would appear that only

about one farm out of eighteen is of much importance as far 
as commercial dairy production is concerned. See table 4. 

Although dairying is relatively undeveloped for the State as 
a whole, there are certain areas within the State where dairy- 
ing has been developed to a considerable extent. In 1939 there 
were 20.2 milk cows per square mile in the lower Northeast 
Mississippi Milkshed Area and 18.1 milk cows per square mile 
in the Upper Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area. See table 
5. These figures compare rather favorably with the 21.9 and 
22.5 milk cows per square mile in the Middle Atlantic and East 
North Central States, which are the most concentrated dairy 
states in the nation. Cows milked per square mile in the other 
important milkshed areas are as follows: 13.1 in the Upper 
Brown Loam; 10.8 in Central Mississippi, and 8.4 in South- 
west Mississippi. See figure 1 for the location of the various 
milkshed areas. 

As shown above, the greater part of the milk and cream sold 
in Mississippi is produced on farms with five or more cows. 
A breakdown of the size of herds by areas shows that the

herds with five cows or more are concentrated in the Upper 
and Lower Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Areas to a greater 
extent than in any of the other areas. See table 5. The Up- 
per Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area has the smallest per- 
centage of farms with no cows, 12.7 percent as compared to 
from 23.5 to 30.4 percent for the other milkshed areas. 

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF DAIRY 
MANUFACTURING PLANTS^ 

Commercial dairy production, other than small amounts of 
fluid milk around towns, did not get started in Mississippi un- 
til after the boll weevil came in and played havoc with cotton 
production for several years. The boll weevil infestation be- 
gan to get serious about 1908 or 1909, and within a few years 
farmers were looking for other sources of income to supple- 
ment their decreased cotton income. It was during this period 
that the dairy industry began to develop in Mississippi. 

There is some doubt as to which of two creameries should 
be accorded the distinction of being the first dairy manufac- 
turing plant in the State. A cooperative creamery was organ- 
ized at Brookhaven in 1909 but closed soon after. This plant 
was reopened for business in May 1913 by private manage- 
ment, but, in the meantime, the A & M Cooperative Creamery 
at A & M College, Starkville, Mississippi, had been opened for 
business in September 1912. It would be correct and probably 
satisfactory to all concerned to say that the first creamery 
was established at Brookhaven but that the first creamery to 
continue operation was established at State College. 

The location of other early creameries and the date each 
started operation is as follows: Macon, July 1913; Meridian, 
October 1, 1914; West, October 16, 1914; Jackson, November, 
1914; Okolona, 1914 or 1915; Aberdeen, and a second creamery 
at Brookhaven, 1915; and McComb, Sumrall, Tupelo, Water 
Valley, Durant, and Lexington, 1916. By 1919, 24 creameries 
were in operation and the number in operation remained at 
about this level until 1926 when the first condensery was open- 
ed at Starkville. The condensery at Starkville was soon fol- 
lowed by condenseries at Tupelo in 1927 and at Macon and Kos- 
ciusko in 1928. 



iSee figures 2, 3, and 4 for shifts in the type and location of plants and figure 5 for 
the location of plants that have gone out of business or been replaced by plants using 
more of the total milk solids. 



12 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 

Cheese plants were the last of the three major types of 
dairy manufacturing plants to begin operating in Mississippi. 
The first cheese plant in Mississippi of which record is avail- 
able was opened at Yazoo City in July 1927; however, an in- 
adequate volume of milk was available and this plant was forc- 
ed to close soon after opening. Kraft Cheese Company open- 
ed plants at Durant and Louisville in September and Novem- 
ber of 1927. Cheese plants were opened at Billups, Montrose, 
Houston, Philadelphia, Columbus, Winona, Water Valley, Olive 
Branch, Indianola, West, Aberdeen, and McComb, in 1928. The 
cheese plants in the last three towns were opened in connec- 
tion with creameries that were already operating. Most of 
the early cheese plants had difficulty in securing volume enough 
to operate at a profit; 7 of the first 15 cheese plants to open 
for business were closed in less than a year and only 3 are still 
operating today. In addition, a cheese plant was re-established 
in one of the above towns a few years after the original plant 
closed. 

The number of plants manufacturing dairy products increas- 
ed from 26 in 1926 to 39 in 1928 as a result of the establish- 
ment of cheese plants and condenseries. The number of man- 
ufacturing plants reached a peak in 1932 and 1933 when 45 
plants were in operation. Since that time, the number in op- 
eration has declined until there were only 29 operating in 
1943 and 31 in 1944. The decline in the number of creameries 
accounts for most of the decrease in plants during this period. 
As will be shown later in the section on prices, creameries 
cannot pay as much per pound of butterfat in cream as cheese 
plants and condenseries can pay for butterfat in milk. This 
has resulted in creameries going out of business in most areas 
where they were in direct competition with cheese plants or 
condenseries. Figures 4 and 5 show cheese plants or conden- 
series now operating in towns or counties where creameries 
have gone out of business. See Appendix table 1 for the num- 
ber and type of plants in operation by years. 

BUTTERFAT PURCHASED FROM PRODUCERS^ 

The amount of butterfat purchased by dairy manufacturing 
plants has increased, period by period, since the first plant was 

-The amount of butterfat purchased from producers has been converted to pounds of 
milk equivalent for the benefit of those who are more interested in whole milk than 
butterfat. See column 5 of tables 6 and 7. However, the result will be essentially the 
same, regardless of which measure of volume is used in discussing the trend in purchases. 
Tables 2 and 3 in the Appendix give the purchases of butterfat or milk equivalent by 
years.

established in 1912. See table 6. The butterfat purchased 
from producers reached an annual average of 3,096,000 pounds 
in the 2-year period 1919-20, and increased rapidly thereafter 
to an average of 11,172,000 pounds in the 4 years ending with 
1932. After 1932, purchases continued to increase, though at 
a slower rate, to 13,997,000 pounds per year in the period 1941- 
44. The amount of butterfat purchased per year increased 8,- 
076,000 pounds between 1919-20 and 1929-32 and 2,825,000 
pounds between 1929-32 and 1941-44. Thus, the absolute rate 
of increase was only about one-third as great after 1932. 

The above figures do not, however, tell the whole story as 
to the increase in butterfat purchased after 1932. The amount 
of butterfat purchased by all dairy plants (manufacturing 
plants plus fluid milk and ice cream plants) increased from 
12,361,000 pounds per year for the period 1929-32 to 17,359,- 
000 pounds for the period 1941-44, an increase of 4,998,000 
pounds. See table 7. In other words, the amount of butterfat 
purchased by all dairy plants increased 40 percent between 
1929-32 and 1941-44 as compared to an increase of 25 percent 
for manufacturing plants. The decrease in the proportion of 
milk and cream going to manufacturing plants during the war 
period was caused by the unusually heavy demand for fluid 
milk and ice cream, which in turn was brought about by the 
establishment of army camps in Mississippi and the increase 
in income among the low-income families. Manufacturing 
plants purchased 81 percent of butterfat bought by all dairy 
plants during the period 1941-44 as compared to 90 percent for 
the period 1929-32.

The 40 percent increase in the amount of butterfat purchas- 
ed by all dairy plants between 1929-32 and 1941-44 was the re- 
sult of a 73 percent increase in the number of patrons selling 
butterfat and a 19 percent decrease in the amount of butter- 
fat sold per patron. The number of patrons selling butterfat 
increased, period by period, from 22,603 per year for the period 
1929-32 to 39,036 per year for the period 1941-44. The amount 
of butterfat sold per patron decreased from 574 pounds per 
year during the period 1929-32 to 410 pounds per year during 
the period 1937-40, then increased slightly to 445 pounds per 
year during the next 4-year period. See table 8. It is likely 
that the increased production per patron during 1941-44 was 
the result of higher prices and the heavy pressure put on farm- 
ers by the government to produce more milk. 

Whole milk is becoming relatively more and more important 
in the manufacture of dairy products in Mississippi. The per-

the total for the period 1941-1944.

cent of total butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants that 
was purchased in milk, increased from 10 percent for the pe- 
riod 1921-24, when butter was the only product manufactured, 
to 33 percent for the period 1925-28, when condenseries and 
cheese plants first began operating. Milk purchases more than 
doubled during the next 4-year period, while the amount of 
butterfat purchased in cream declined by 27 percent. This 
caused the amount of butterfat purchased in milk to jump to 
61 percent of the total, almost twice the percentage for the 
preceding period. The amount of milk purchased continued 
to increase and the amount of butterfat purchased in cream 
continued to decrease each period until 84 percent of all but- 
terfat purchased by manufacturing plants was purchased in 
whole milk during the last 4-year period. Butterfat in milk 
brings a price considerably higher than butterfat sold in cream 
and, for this reason, most farmers living on or close to milk 
routes sell whole milk. 

BUTTERFAT MANUFACTURED 

The amount of butterfat manufactured into dairy products 
increased in much the same manner as the amount of milk 
or its equivalent purchased by manufacturing plants, with the 
exception that the amount of butterfat manufactured from 1941 
to 1944 decreased 0.8 percent as compared to the preceding 1- 
year period. See table 9. As already mentioned, the unusually 
heavy demand for fluid milk and ice cream has caused many 
plants to sell considerable quantities of fluid milk and sweet 
cream during the war period. These plants were forced to do 
this from a profit standpoint because butterfat can be sold for 
a higher profit per pound in fluid milk and sweet cream than 
in manufactured form.

SOLIDS NOT FAT MANUFACTURED 

The amount of solids not fat utilized by dairy manufactur- 
ing plants in Mississippi was negligible until after 1926 when 
condenseries and cheese plants first began operating. Up to 
that time, most of the solids not fat in the milk from which 
butterfat was used in manufacturing butter were retained on 
farms in the form of skim milk. During the period 1929-32, 
the solids not fat retained on farms in the form of skim milk 
amounted to only 36 percent of the total in milk sold as whole 
milk and cream. Both the absolute and relative amount of 
solids not fat retained on farms have continued to decrease to 
the present time. Only 14 percent of the total solids not fat 
in milk sold as whole milk and cream was retained on farms 
in the form of skim milk during the period 1941-44. See table 
10. 

The amount of solids not fat manufactured in cheese, con- 
densed milk, and concentrated by-products, averaged 8,066,000 
pounds per year during the period 1929-32 and 15,584,000 
pounds per year during the period 1941-44. This is an increase 
of 93 percent. The fact that the amount of butterfat manu- 
factured only increased 11 percent during this same period fur- 
ther emphasizes the increasing importance of solids not fat in 
the manufacture of dairy products in Mississippi.

VOLUME PER PLANT MANUFACTURING DAIRY 
PRODUCTS 

Volume per plant manufacturing dairy products has increas- 
ed continuously, with one exception, since the first successful 
plant was established in 1912. Plants operating in the period 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 21 

1929-32 had a smaller volume than the plants operating in 
the preceding period. See table 11. The annual volume of 
butterfat manufactured per plant increased from 60,000 pounds 
for the period 1912-16 to 226,000 pounds for the period 1929- 
32, and 347,000 pounds for the period 1941-44. That is, the 
amount of butterfat manufactured per plant increased 166,- 
000 pounds or 276 percent between 1912-16 and 1929-32, and 
121,000 pounds or 54 percent between 1929-32 and 1941-44. 
When the amount of butterfat purchased from producers is 
considered, volume per plant has increased even more since 
1932. The amount of butterfat purchased from producers per 
plant increased from 255,000 pounds per year for the period 
1929-32 to 441,000 pounds for the period 1941-44, an increase 
of 186,000 pounds or 73 percent. 

Although the number of plants manufacturing dairy products 
decreased 27 percent between 1929-32 and 1941-44, the volume 
of butterfat purchased per plant increased enough (73 percent) 
to bring about a 13 percent increase in the amount of butter- 
fat purchased from producers. This trend toward a smaller 
number of plants with a larger volume will in all probability 
continue for sometime, because most plants in Mississippi, if 
not all, are operating at levels far below their most efficient 
volume. (See figure 8 for the relationships between capacity 
and volume handled at 12 plants in 1944.)

DAIRY PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED 
Butter 

The number of creameries in operation increased rapidly 
from 1 in 1912 to 24 in 1919, then remained at about this level 
throughout the Twenties. The number of creameries reached 
a peak in 1932 and 1933 when 28 plants operated; since that 
time, the number operating has decreased until only 11 plants 
reported the manufacture of butter in 1944. The amount of 
butter manufactured reached a peak of 8,884,000 pounds in 
1932, then declined to 4,491,000 pounds in 1944, about one- 
half as much. That is, both the number of creameries ope- 
rating and the amount of butter manufactured decreased after 
1932. See figure 6. 

The number of creameries operating, the amount of butter 
manufactured, and the volume manufactured per plant was 
calculated by 4-year periods in order to smooth out the yearly 
fluctuations (caused by climatic conditions) and, consequently, 
to smooth out the trend in the above items. When this was 
done, it was" found that the number of creameries and the total 
amount of butter manufactured increased, period by period.

through 1929-32, then decreased, period by period, thereafter. 
The volume manufactured per plant increased through the pe- 
riod 1925-28, decreased slightly the next two periods, then con- 
tinued to increase to the present. See table 12. Between 1929- 
32 and 1941-44, the number of creameries operating decreas- 
ed 56 percent, the volume manufactured per plant increased 36 
percent, and total amount of butter manufactured decreased 
40 percent. 

Competition among creameries for butterfat became rather 
intense during the Twenties and this led to the indiscriminate 
establishment of cream buying stations throughout the import- 
ant milk producing areas. During this period, practically 100 
percent of the cream buying stations were company-owned and 
as many as five different stations were operated in the same 
town in some instances. The number of cream buying stations 
increased from 4 in 1919 to a peak of 180 in 1930, then decreas- 
ed gradually to 104 in 1939. The number in operation has de- 
creased rapidly during the war; only 46 were operated in 1944 
and only 5 of these were company-owned stations. 



Cheese 

Cheese plants in Mississippi were established rapidly after 
the first three plants opened in 1927. The number of cheese 
plants increased to 13 the next year and the number in opera- 
tion has not exceeded or fallen short of this total by more 
than 4 plants since that time. Fourteen plants have manu- 
factured cheese in each of the last 4 years. The amount of 
cheese manufactured increased from 198,000 pounds in 1927

and 2,531,000 pounds in 1928 to a peak of 11,006,000 pounds 
in 1938. Production in 1944 amounted to 10,969,000 pounds 
or 0.3 percent less than in 1938. See figure 7. 

Although more cheese was manufactured in 1938 than in 
any other year, a combination of the years into groups shows 
that 982,000 pounds or 11 percent more cheese was manufac- 
tured per year during the period 1941-44 than during the pe- 
riod 1937-40. See table 13. In fact, the amount of cheese 
manufactured per year has increased, period by period, since

cheese plants were first established. Although the number of 
cheese plants operating increased only slightly between 1929- 
32 and 1941-44, the volume manufactured per plant increased 
to such an extent (77 percent) that total cheese production 
more than doubled (an increase of 102 percent). 

Condensed milk 

The number of condenseries operating in Mississippi increas- 
ed from one in 1926 to two in 1927 and to four in 1928, where 
it has since remained. Condenseries require considerably more 
milk for efficient operation than cheese plants; this, no doubt, 
has limited their number. The amount of condensed milk 
manufactured increased from 17 million pounds per year for 
the period 1926-28 to 51 million pounds for the period 1941- 
44. The amount of condensed milk manufactured and, conse- 
quently, the volume per plant, almost doubled (90 percent 
increase) between 1929-32 and 1941-44. See table 14.

Concentrated by-products 

Concentrated by-products have become of more and more im- 
portance in the dairy industry in Mississippi. Between 1929- 
32 and 1941-44, the amount of condensed skimmed milk man- 
ufactured increased from 2,013,000 pounds per year to 4,686,- 
000 pounds per year; the amount of non-fat dry milk solids 
increased from 602,000 pounds per year to 1,635,000 pounds 
per year, and the amount of dried buttermilk manufactured 
decreased from 396,000 pounds per year to 286,000 pounds per 
year. That is, two and one-third times as much condensed 
skimmed milk, two and three-fourths as much non-fat dry milk 
solids, and seven-tenths as much dried buttermilk were man-

FLUID MILK SALES AND ICE CREAM PRODUCED 

Fluid milk sales remained at approximately the same level 
from the period 1929-32 through the period 1937-40, then al- 
most tripled the next 4-year period. The amount of fluid milk 
or its equivalent sold per year increased from 29 million pounds 
for the period 1937-40 to 81 million pounds for the period 
1941-44. The number of plants selling fluid milk increased

DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 2 7 

The amount of ice cream manufactured increased slowly 
from 959,000 gallons per year for the period 1929-32 to 1,319,- 
000 gallons per year for the period 1937-40. The amount of 
ice cream manufactured jumped to 2,751,000 gallons per year 
for the period 1941-44, an increase of over 100 percent. No 
attempt was made to tabulate the increase in the number of 
establishments manufacturing (or freezing) ice cream because 
of the tremendous increase in counter freezers during the past 
few years. However, the number of plants manufacturing ice 
cream mix decreased from 35 per year for the period 1929-32 
to 24 per year for the period 1941-44. 

The tremendous increase in fluid milk and ice cream sales 
during the period 1941-44 was the direct result of the war 
which caused army camps to be located in Mississippi and the 
income of low-income families to increase. It is likely that 
fluid milk and ice cream sales in Mississippi will return to ap- 
proximately their pre-war levels after the war, unless the in- 
come of the people of Mississippi, especially low income groups 
can be maintained at levels considerably higher than in pre- 
war years. 

RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS 

Butter, condensed milk, and cheese, in the order named, were 
the most important dairy products manufactured in Mis- 
sissippi between 1929 and 1932. Since that time, butter has 
declined in volume and condensed milk and cheese increas- 
ed until both condensed milk and cheese rank ahead of 
butter in importance, with condensed milk ranking first. In 
arriving at the relative importance of the various dairy 
products, the solids not fat manufactured into each product 
were taken into consideration as well as the butterfat util-

ized. See table 17 and 18. Concentrated by-products and ice 
cream were also relatively more important between 1941 and 
1944 than between 1929 and 1932. 

Between 1929-32 and 1937-40, fluid milk sales became re- 
latively less important; however, under the impetus of the war, 
fluid milk sales increased greatly. Fluid milk sales ranked be- 
low butter, condensed milk, and cheese in importance between 
1929 and 1932, but only slightly below condensed milk between 
1941 and 1944. If fluid milk sales not reported^ were taken in- 
to account, fluid milk sales would probably rank first in im- 
portance during the war period, 1941-44. However, after the 
war, fluid milk sales will likely decline to some extent. 

DEVELOPMENT BY AREAS' 

Plants manufacturing dairy products have become more and 
more concentrated in the Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area. 
Seven dairy manufacturing plants out of the 24 in Mississippi 
were operating in the Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area 
in 1919; 17 out of 44 in 1929, and 19 out of 31 in 1944. That 
is, 61 percent of the plants manufacturing dairy products were 
located in this Area in 1944, as compared to 38 percent in 1929 
and 29 percent in 1919. Thirteen creameries and three cheese 
plants have gone out of business in this Area; however, cheese 
plants or condenseries are operating in all towns where cream- 
eries have gone out of business. At least one manufacturing 
plant is located in each county of this Area. 

On the basis of the amount of butterfat purchased from 

3Some of the smaller fluid milk plants and all of the many dairymen who retail their 
own milk do not file reports as to production and sales. 

4See figure 2, 3, and 4 for shifts in the type and location of plants, and figure 5 for 
the location of plants that have gone out of business or been replaced by plants using 
more of the total milk solids. Tables 5 and 6 in the Appendix give the amount of butter- 
fat purchased in each area by years.

producers, this Area has become even more important in the 
dairy manufacturing industry in Mississippi. The amount of 
butterfat purchased from producers has increased both abso- 
lutely and relatively, period by period, to the present time. See 
tables 19 and 20. Manufacturing plants in this Area purchas- 
ed 71 percent of the butterfat purchased by all manufacturing 
plants in Mississippi for the period 1941-44, as compared to 53 
percent for the period 1929-32, and 41 percent for the period 
1916-20. 

Although the Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area is a con- 
tinuous area, the development in the upper and lower parts 
has been quite different. The lower part of the Area develop- 
ed earlier and at a more rapid rate than the upper part of the 
Area through the period 1929-32, whereas, the upper part of 
the Area has developed at a faster rate since that time. The 
number of manufacturing plants operating in the lower part of 
the Area increased from 6 in 1919 to 13 in 1929, and 13 in 1944; 
the number operating in the upper part of the Area increased 
from 1 in 1919 to 4 in 1929, and 6 in 1944. The amount of 
butterfat purchased from producers per year by manufacturing 
plants increased 1,257,000 pounds in the upper and 3,566,000 
pounds in the lower part of the Area between 1916-20 and 
1929-32; between 1929-32 and 1941-44, the amount of butter- 
fat purchased from producers per year increased 2,599,000 
pounds in the upper and 1,491,000 pounds in the lower part of 
the Area. In other words, the lower part of the Area devel- 
oped about three times as fast as the upper part through the 
period 1929-32, but only about one-half as fast after that time. 

The upper part of the Northeast Mississippi Milkshed Area 
has increased its relative importance, period by period, from

3 percent of the total butterfat purchased by manufacturing 
plants for the period 1916-20 to 28 percent for the period 
1941-44. In contrast, the lower part of the Area has been 
able to increase its relative position only slightly, from 38 per- 
cent of the total for the period 1916-20 to 43 percent of the 
total for the period 1941-44. 

The number of manufacturing plants in the Upper Brown 
Loam Area increased from one in 1919 to four in 1929, and 
five in 1944. Six creameries and three cheese plants have 
gone out of business in this Area. Manufacturing plants that 
have gone out of business in three counties of this Area have not 
been replaced. The amount of butterfat purchased from pro- 
ducers per year increased from 55,000 pounds for the period 
1916-20 to 1,151,000 pounds for the period 1937-40, and then 
decreased to 822,000 pounds for the period 1941-44. The de- 
crease in the amount of butterfat purchased by manufacturing 
plants in this Area during the war period is probably the re- 
sult of more milk being trucked into Memphis to satisfy the 
increased demand of its wartime population for fluid milk. 

The Upper Brown Loam Area increased in relative import- 
ance in the manufacture of dairy products up through the pe- 
riod 1937-40, then decreased to some extent during the next 
4-year period. Manufacturing plants in this Area purchased 
2 percent of the butterfat purchased by Mississippi manufac- 
turing plants during the period 1916-20, 9 percent during the 
period 1937-41, and 6 percent during the period 1941-44. 

It is likely that the amount of butterfat purchased by man- 
ufacturing plants in this Area will resume its upward trends 
after the war. This will be true if the demand for fluid milk 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 31 

should fall off in this Area and the milk thus released re- 
turned to manufacturing plants. 

The number of plants manufacturing dairy products in the 
Central Mississippi Milkshed Area increased from 8 in 1919 to 
12 in 1929, then decreased to 4 by 1944. That is, one-third 
of the plants manufacturing dairy products in Mississippi were 
operating in this Area in 1919 as contrasted to about one- 
fourth in 1929 and one-eighth in 1944. Twelve creameries and 
five cheese plants have discontinued operating in this area. Man- 
ufacturing plants that have gone out of business in five counties 
have not been replaced; however, milk cooling stations are 
operated in two of these counties. 

The dairy industry got an early start in the Central Missis- 
sippi Area, but failed to develop as rapidly and to as great 
an extent as the State as a whole. In fact, this Area reached 
its peak production during the period 1929-32. The amount 
of butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants increased from 
527,000 pounds per year for the period 1916-20 to 1,819,000 
pounds for the period 1929-32, then decreased to 1,750,000 
pounds for the period 1941-44. Relatively speaking, this Area 
has declined in importance since the period 1916-20. Plants 
in this Area purchased 21 percent of all butterfat purchased 
by manufacturing plants in Mississippi during the period 1916- 
20; by the time this Area had reached its peak production 
during the period 1929-32, this percentage had declined to 16. 
Only 13 percent of all butterfat purchased by manufacturing 
plants in Mississippi was purchased by plants in the Area dur- 
ing the period 1941-44. 

Four plants manufactured dairy products in the Southwest 
Mississippi Milkshed Area in 1919, five in 1929, and two in 
1944. Eight creameries and one cheese plant have discontin- 
ued manufacturing dairy products. Plants manufacturing dairy 
products that have gone out of business in six counties have 
not been replaced with manufacturing plants; however, fluid 
milk plants and milk cooling stations which supply fluid milk 
to New Orleans, army camps, and local towns are operating 
in four of these counties. 

The amount of butterfat purchased from producers by man- 
ufacturing plants increased from 492,000 pounds per year for 
the period 1916-20 to 1,264,000 pounds per year for the period 



3 2 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 

1925-28, then decreased to 580,000 pounds per year for the pe- 
riod 1941-44. In terms of its relative importance in the man- 
ufacture of dairy products, this area has declined, since the 
period 1916-20. Plants in the area purchased 20 percent of all 
butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants in Mississippi 
during the period 1916-20, 14 percent during the period 1925- 
28, and 4 percent during the period 1941-44. 

The Southwest Mississippi Area has become predominately a 
fluid milk area and to get a correct picture of its dairying, 
the amount of butterfat purchased by fluid milk and ice cream 
plants must be added to the amount purchased by manufac- 
turing plants. When this was done, it was found that butter- 
fat purchased by all dairy plants in the Area decreased from 
1,443,000 pounds per year for the period 1929-32 to 1,284,000 
pounds per year for the period 1937-40; however, production 
has been stimulated by the increased wartime demand for fluid 
milk and the amount of butterfat purchased by all dairy plants 
amounted to 2,247,000 pounds per year during the period 1941- 
44, an increase of 75 percent over the preceding 4-year period. 
Plants in the Area purchased 13 percent of the total butterfat 
purchased by all dairy plants in Mississippi during the period 
1941-44 as compared to 9 percent for the period 1937-40, and 
12 percent for the period 1929-32. See tables 21 and 22. Thus, 
the purchases of butterfat for fluid milk purposes have in- 
creased to such an extent that the butterfat purchased by all 
dairy plants amounted to over 50 percent more for the period 
1941-44 than for the period 1929-32, although the amount of 
butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants had decreased 
by over 50 percent during the same period.

The amount of butterfat purchased by all dairy plants in 
the Southwest Area may again take up the downward trend 
that was in evidence before the war. In all probability, many 
producers who have gone into or expanded milk production 
during the wartime period on the basis of fluid milk prices, 
will find that they cannot profitably produce lower priced milk 
for manufacturing purposes if the wartime fluid milk markets 
decline in importance. 

SEASONAL VARIATION IN MILK AND BUTTERFAT 
PURCHASES 

Due to the seasonal variation in milk production, the amount 
of milk and butterfat purchased by dairy plants varied greatly 
during the various months. Monthly milk purchases varied

from 4.8 percent of the annual volume in January to 12.5 per- 
cent in May for the 16-year period 1929-44; monthly butter- 
fat purchases varied from 5.1 percent of the annual volume 
in February to 11.8 percent in May during the same period. 
To further emphasize the concentration of milk and butterfat 
purchases during the summer months, it should be pointed out 
that 48 percent of the milk and 45 percent of the butterfat is 
purchased in the 4 months of May, June, July and August. 
That is, almost one-half the volume of milk and butterfat is 
purchased in one-third of the year. See table 23. 

Butterfat purchases are not concentrated in the summer 
months to as great an extent as milk purchases because the 
butterfat content of milk is at its lowest level during the sum- 
mer months. The butterfat content of milk varied from a 
low of 4.22 percent in June to 5.18 percent in November, and 
averaged 4.50 percent for the year during the period 1938-44. 
See table 24. 

Plants could operate more efficiently if they obtained a 
greater percentage of their volume during the winter months, 
and consequently, they could afford to pay higher prices for 
milk if this were the case. Much time and effort have been 
spent trying to persuade the farmers to produce more feed and 
to feed heavier during the winter months with the idea of 
producing a greater part of the annual volume during the 
winter months. In order to determine if any progress has 
been made in increasing the proportion of milk and butterfat 
purchased during the winter months, the 16-year period 1929- 
44 was divided into two 8-year periods, 1929-36, and 1937-44, 
and the percentage of milk and butterfat purchased each month

calculated for both periods. The division of the data in this 
manner showed that the proportion purchased each month had 
not changed materially, but that what little change there had 
been was in the opposite direction from what plant managers 
would like. A slightly smaller percentage of milk and butter- 
fat was purchased in the winter months of November to Feb- 
ruary and a slightly higher percent in the summer months of 
May to August during the period 1937-44 than during the pe- 
riod 1929-36. See table 23. 

The tremendous difference in the volume of milk or its equi- 
valent purchased by dairy plants in the winter months as com- 
pared to the summer months is brought about by a decline in 
the number of patrons selling milk as well as a decline in the 
amount of milk or its equivalent sold per patron; however, 
the decline in the amount of milk sold per patron is greater 
than the decline in the number of patrons. For example, be- 
tween May and January, the high and low months in volume, 
the number of patrons selling milk or cream decreased 34 per- 
cent; the amount of milk or its equivalent sold per patron de- 
creased 42 percent, with the result that the amount of milk 
or its equivalent purchased by dairy plants decreased 62 per- 
cent. See table 25. 

The concentration of milk production in the summer months 
has resulted in about one-half the dairy products in Missis-

sippi being- manufactured in the 4-month period, May-August, 
and about two-thirds in the 6-month period April-September. 
Fifty-two percent of the cheese manufactured in Mississippi 
between 1938 and 1944 was manufactured in the 4-month pe- 
riod, May-August, and 69 percent in the 6-month period, April- 
September; 44 percent and 63 percent of the condensed milk 
and 45 percent and 62 percent of the butter were manufactur- 
ed during the same periods. See Appendix table 7. 

Relation of Seasonal Production to Plant Capacity and 
Efficiency of Operation 

In order to determine the extent of capacity at which dairy 
manufacturing plants operated, the capacity and the amount 
of milk or its equivalent purchased each month were obtained 
for 12 manufacturing plants. The summarization of these data 
showed that these plants operated at about two-thirds of ca- 
pacity during their peak month, at slightly less than one-fourth 
of capacity during the month in which their volume was low- 
est, and averaged operating at 45 percent of capacity for the 
year. Monthly deliveries at the plant which operated at the 
highest percentage of capacity for the year varied from 29 per- 
cent of capacity to over 100 percent of capacity for 2 months, 
and averaged 68 percent of capacity for the year. One other 
plant had deliveries exceeding capacity for 2 months. Month- 
ly deliveries at the plant operating at the lowest percent of ca- 
pacity for the year varied from 15 percent of capacity to 51 
percent of capacity, and averaged 31 percent of capacity for 
the year. See figure 8. 

The efficiency of operation at any plant is related directly 
to the percentage of capacity at which that plant operates. 
There are certain fixed charges such as upkeep of buildings 
and equipment, depreciation, interest on investment, and man- 
agement cost that must be met regardless of whether the 
plant operates at 5 percent of capacity or 100 percent of ca- 
pacity. It is readily apparent, therefore, that the cost of man- 
ufacturing a pound of cheese or of butter or condensed milk 
decreases continuously until the plant is operating at full ca- 
pacity. It is impossible for dairy manufacturing plants to 
operate at 100 percent of capacity for the year because of the 
unavoidable variations in milk production; however, the nearer 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 



37 



they approach this ideal, the greater will be the opportunity to 
increase the efficiency of the milk plant operation. 

If the volume of milk or its equivalent purchased by the 12 
plants discussed above could be increased until they reached 
100 percent of capacity during their peak months, they would 
operate at 68 percent of capacity for the year instead of 45 
percent. Thus, their efficiency of operation for the year would 
be increased considerably, and this would just about represent 
maximum efficiency for the average manufacturing plant in 
Mississippi because of the seasonal variation in milk production. 

The volume of milk or its equivalent purchased per manu- 
facturing plant can be increased by (1) increasing total milk 
production or (2) decreasing the number of plants operating. 
As shown earlier in this report, both the above factors have 
been working since 1932 to increase the volume handled per 
manufacturing plant.

Relation of Seasonal Variation in Milk Production to 
Efficiency of Milk Transportation 

Due to the seasonal variation in milk production, the cost of 
transporting milk to manufacturing plants is approximately 
two and one-half times as great in the winter as in the sum- 
mer months. The amount of milk hauled per mile by 79 milk 
routes averaged 22 pounds in January as compared to 53 pounds 
in June. The increase of 31 pounds in the amount of milk 
hauled per mile between January and June was the result of 
the number of patrons selling milk increasing from 1.46 to 2.20 
per mile, and the amount of milk sold per patron per day in- 
creasing from 30 to 49 pounds. The number of patrons per 
mile, the milk sold per patron per day, and the amount of milk 
hauled per mile increased through June, then decreased there- 
after. See figure 9. 

Routes at two of the nine plants included in this study 
were run every other day during the winter months. These 
routes doubled their volume per mile over what it would have 
been if they had run every day, with the result that the vol- 




MONTHS

hauled per mile, by months, 79 milk routes, Mississippi, 1944. 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 39 

ume hauled per mile during the winter months amounted to 
only slightly less than during the summer months. 

The problem of transporting milk to manufacturing plants 
is more than a seasonal one because of the low annual volume 
hauled on many routes. The average amount of milk hauled 
per mile on the 79 routes studied amounted to 36.1 pounds 
per mile for 1944; however, the amount hauled on individual 
routes varied from as low as 12 pounds to as high as 98 pounds 
per mile for the year. Eight routes averaged hauling less than 
20 pounds of milk per mile during 1944; 17 hauled from 20 to 
30 pounds; 19 hauled from 30 to 40 pounds; 17 hauled from 
40 to 50 pounds; 10 hauled from 50 to 60 pounds, and 8 hauled 
60 pounds and above. It is interesting to note that both the 
patrons per mile and the amount of milk sold per patron in- 
creased consistently as the amount of milk hauled per mile in- 
creased. See table 26.

PRICES PAID PRODUCERS FOR MILK AND BUTTERFAT 

Prices paid producers for milk and butterfat have varied con- 
siderably during the past 16 years. The price paid for 100 
pounds of 4.5 percent milk varied from $0.97 in 1932 to $2.77 
in 1944 at cheese plants; from $0.98 in 1932 to $3.07 in 1944 
at condenseries, and from $1.49 in 1932 to $3.83 in 1944 at fluid 
milk plants. The price paid per pound of butterfat in cream 
varied from $0.15 in 1932 to $0.53 in 1944. In other words, 
cheese plants paid 2.9 times as much for milk in 1944 as 1932, 
condenseries, 3.1 times as much, and fluid milk plants, 2.6 
times as much. Butterfat in cream sold for 3.5 times as much 
in 1944 as in 1932. If the government subsidy of $0.40 to 
$0.70 per hundred pounds for the production of milk and $0.06 



4 0 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 



to $0.17 per pound for the production of butterfat in cream 
were added to the amount paid by dairy plants, the increase 
in the prices paid producers between 1932 and 1944 would be 
even more pronounced. 

From 1929 to 1944 fluid milk plants paid an average of 
32.8 percent more per 100 pounds of 4.5 percent milk than 
condenseries ; condenseries paid an average of 3.4 percent more 
per hundred pounds of 4.5 percent milk than cheese plants; 
and cheese plants paid an average of 24.3 percent more per 
pound of butterfat in milk than creameries and other plants 
paid per pound of butterfat in cream. See table 27. 

Seasonal Variation in Prices 

During the 3-year period, 1938-40, the actual price paid for 
milk at condenseries and cheese plants varied from 89 percent 
of the average annual price in June to 131 percent in Decem- 
ber; however, when the monthly prices were adjusted to the 
price that would have been paid for 4.5 percent milk, it was 
found that the price varied from 95 percent of the average 
annual price in May, June, and August to 112 percent in Jan- 
uary. Therefore, a considerable part of the seasonal variation

DEVELOPMENl OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 41 

in the actual prices paid for milk at cheese plants and con- 
denseries is due to the seasonal change in the butterfat con- 
tent of milk. See the upper part of figure 10. The shaded 
area in this figure shows the variation in price that is due to 
the seasonal change in the butterfat content of milk and the 
dotted line shows the true seasonal variation in price. 

The increased demand for milk products during the war has 
resulted in the seasonal variation in prices being modified to 
some extent. The price paid for 4.5 percent milk at conden- 
series and cheese plants varied from 97 percent of the aver- 
age annual price in June to 105 percent in December, a va- 
riation only about half as great as in the pre-war period, 1938- 
40. See the lower part of figure 10. Since the wartime pe- 
riod, 1942-44, is abnormal, the seasonal variation in prices that 
prevailed during the pre-war period, 1938-40, is the one most 
likely to prevail in the postwar period.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 



The seasonal variation in the price of butterfat in cream is 
similar to that of milk purchased by cheese plants and con- 
denseries; however, the seasonal variation in the prices paid 
for fluid milk is not nearly so great. During the period 1938- 
40, the price paid for 100 pounds of 4.5 percent milk varied 
from 97 percent of the average annual price in June to 105 
percent in February, a variation only about one-half as great 
as for milk sold to cheese plants and condenseries. This is 
the result of fluid milk plants having a rather uniform market, 
both as to demand and price throughout the year. 

The seasonal variation in price is related directly to the sea- 
sonal variation in production; that is, prices are lowest when 
the most milk is being sold and highest when milk sales are 
at their lowest point. In fact, the price paid per hundred 
pounds of milk at condenseries and cheese plants between 1938 
and 1940 was below the average annual price in every month 
in which milk purchases were above average, and above the 
average annual price in every month in which milk purchases 
were below average. See figure 11.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 43 

SUMMARY 

Dairying as a major farm enterprise is relatively undevel- 
oped in Mississippi as compared to some of the more concen- 
trated dairy areas of the United States such as the Middle 
Atlantic and East North Central States. Although Missis- 
sippi's relative position in the production of milk in the United 
States has remained about the same for the last 40 years, 
her relative position in milk sales has increased considerably. 
With regard to their relative contribution to total farm in- 
come, dairy products have doubled in importance since the 
period 1924-28. 

Commercial dairy production did not get started in Missis- 
sippi until after the boll weevil came in and played havoc 
with cotton production for several years. The boll weevil in- 
festation began to get serious about 1908 or 1909; and the 
first creamery to continue operation was established at Mis- 
sissippi A & M College (now Mississippi State College) in 1912. 
This creamery was followed by two others in 1913, four in 
1914, two in 1915, and six in 1916. By 1919, 24 creameries 
were in operation and the number remained at about this level 
until the first condensery was established in 1926 and the first 
cheese plant in 1927. The number of manufacturing plants 
increased rapidly to 39 in 1928, then more slowly to a peak of 
45 in 1932 and 1933. Since that time, the number in operation 
has declined until only 31 plants were in operation in 1944. 
The decline in the number of creameries, which cannot pay as 
much per pound of butterfat in cream as cheese plants and 
condenseries can pay per pound of butterfat in milk, accounts 
for most of the decrease in manufacturing plants during this 
period. 

The amount of butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants 
has increased, period by period, since the first plant was estab- 
lished in 1912, although at a slower rate after 1932. The 
amount of butterfat purchased from producers increased from 
3,096,000 pounds per year for the period 1913-20 to 11,172,000 
pounds per year for the period 1929-32, and 13,997,000 pounds 
for the period 1941-44. 

Relatively speaking, the amount of butterfat purchased by 
all dairy plants increased more between 1929-32 and 1941-44 
than the amount purchased by manufacturing plants alone. 



4 4 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN No. 422 

The amount of butterfat purchased by all dairy plants increas- 
ed 40 percent between 1929-32 and 1941-44 as compared to an 
increase of 25 percent for manufacturing plants. The 40-per- 
cent increase in the amount of butterfat purchased by all dairy 
plants between 1929-32 and 1941-44 was the result of a 73 
percent increase in the number of patrons selling butterfat and 
a 19 percent decrease in the amount of butterfat sold per patron. 

Whole milk, and consequently solids not fat, is becoming re- 
latively more and more important in the manufacture of dairy 
products in Mississippi. Manufacturing plants purchased 84 
percent of their butterfat in milk during the period 1941-44 as 
compared to 10 percent for the period 1921-24. Solids not fat 
manufactured into dairy products increased 93 percent between 
1929-32 and 1941-44 as compared to an increase of only 11 per- 
cent in the amount of butterfat manufactured. 

Volume per manufacturing plant has continued to increase 
since the first plant was established. The annual volume of 
butterfat manufactured per plant increased from 60,000 pounds 
for the period 1912-20 to 226,000 pounds for the period 1928- 
32, and 347,000 pounds for the period 1941-44. The volume 
of butterfat purchased per manufacturing plant increased 
enough (73 percent) between 1929-32 and 1941-44 to bring 
about a 25 percent increase in the amount of butterfat pur- 
chased from producers, although the number of manufactur- 
ing plants had decreased 27 percent during the same period. 

Since the period 1929-32, butter has become relatively less 
important, and condensed milk, cheese and concentrated by- 
products more important in the dairy industry in Mississippi. 
The amount of butter manufactured decreased 40 percent be- 
tween 1929-32 and 1941-44, as compared to an increase of 90, 
102, and 150 percent, respectively, in the manufacture of con- 
densed milk, cheese, and skim milk products. 

During the last four years, 1941-44, an average of 51,000,000 
pounds of condensed milk, 9,914,000 pounds of cheese, 4,454,000 
pounds of butter, 4,682,000 pounds of condensed skimmed milk, 
and 1,635,000 pounds of non-fat dry milk solids were manu- 
factured per year. 

The dairy manufacturing industry has become more and 
more concentrated in the 12 counties comprising the North- 
east Mississippi Milkshed Area. Plants in this Area purchased 



DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN MISSISSIPPI 4 5 

71 percent of the butterfat purchased by manufacturing plants 
in Mississippi for the period 1941-44 as compared to 53 per- 
cent for the period 1929-32, and 41 percent for the period 1916- 
20. 

The Central Mississippi, Southwest Mississippi, and Upper 
Brown Loam Milkshed Areas have all declined in relative im- 
portance in dairy manufacturing; however, fluid milk produc- 
tion has increased to a considerable amount in the last two 
Areas. 

Due to the seasonal variation in milk production, dairy plants 
purchase approximately one-half their annual volume in the 
4 months of May to August and about one-fifth their annual 
volume during the 4 months of November to February. The 
tremendous difference in the volume of milk or its equivalent 
purchased by dairy plants in the winter months as compared 
to the summer months is brought about by a decline in the 
number of patrons selling milk or cream, as well as a decline 
in the amount sold per patron. There was no material change 
in the seasonal variation in milk production in the 16 years 
from 1929-44. 

The seasonal variation in milk production affects the per- 
centage of capacity at which plants operate and, consequently, 
their efficiency of operation. In 1944, a sample of the manufac- 
turing plants (12) operated at about two-thirds of capacity 
during their peak month, at slightly less than one-fourth of 
capacity during the month in which their volume was lowest, 
and averaged operating at 45 percent of capacity for the year 
as compared to 31 percent for the poorest plant. 

Due to the seasonal variation in milk production, the per unit 
cost of transporting milk to manufacturing plants is approxi- 
mately two and one-half times as great in the winter as in 
the summer months; however, the problem of transporting 
milk to manufacturing plants is more than a seasonal one be- 
cause of the low annual volume hauled on many routes. 

Fluid milk plants pay more for milk than condenseries, con- 
denseries pay more than cheese plants, and cheese plants pay 
more for butterfat in milk than creameries pay for butterfat 
in cream. Prices paid for milk and cream vary directly with 
seasonal productions ; that is, prices are lowest when production 
is highest and prices highest when production is lowest.

iPounds of whole milk purchased plus the milk equivalent of butterfat purchased as cream. 
The milk equivalent of cream was calculated by dividing the butterfat purchased in 
cream by 4.3 and multiplying by 100. It was estimated that a 0.2 pounds of the 
average 4.5 pounds of butterfat in 100 pounds of milk was left in the skim milk on 
the average farm.

Cotton

STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



Summary 



1. Cotton was produced without hand 
labor by cross-plowing, flame cultivation, 
and machine picking. In drilled cotton, 
flamed and machine picked, hand labor 
was used only for additional thinning 
following the Dixie cotton chopper. 

2. Checked or cross-plowed cotton out- 
yielded drilled cotton, had longer staple, 
its seed was lower in free fatty acid and 
higher in grade, and the yarn was strong- 
er and of equal appearance. The extend- 
ed drought may have favored checked cot- 
ton, as there were fewer plants per acre 
on the checked than on the drilled plots. 

3. DefoHation did not affect the yield 
or foreign-matter content of seed cotton. 
It did reduce the moisture content of seed 
cotton, lint, and seed. The grade of 
hand-picked cotton was slightly lowered, 
but an improvement of 0.7 of one grade 
for machine-picked cotton was due to 
defoliation. Defoliation did not material- 
ly affect the grade of cottonseed, but did 
reduce slightly the moisture and free fat- 
ty acid content. It did not change the 
spinning value of the lint. 



4. Flaming versus hoeing showed no 
difference in the values obtained on seed 
cotton, lint, and spinning. Seed show- 
ed a highly significant difference for 
free fatty acid and significant difference 
for grade in favor of flaming. 

5. The mechanical cotton picker picked 
85 percent as much cotton from the plants 
as did the hand pickers. Machine-picked 
seed cotton was materially higher in mois- 
ture and foreign-matter content than 
hand-picked. It was three grades below 
hand picking, but the length and strength 
were not affected. The seed of machine- 
picked cotton had a highly significantly 
higher moisture and free fatty acid con- 
tent, and was significantly lower in grade 
than seed from hand-picked cotton. Al- 
though the picker and card waste was 
much greater for machine-picked cotton, 
spun yarns were stronger and equal in 
appearance for 22s, 44s, and 60s sizes 
when compared with hand-picked cotton. 
The cotton gleaned behind the machine 
was almost 3/32 of an inch shorter and 
slightly stronger than the lint picked by 
hand or by the machine. 



MECHANICAL PRODUCTION OF COTTON^/ 

By P. W. GULL and J. E. ADAMS^^ 



The need for studies to further the 
mechanization of cotton and other crops 
is paramount. Losses of labor to indus- 
try from the South were accelerated as the 
war progressed. Cotton unpicked at 
planting time in 1945 was mute evidence 
of the loss of labor since the 1944 crop 
was planted. 

Welch and Miley (1)^^ give data show- 
ing a labor requirement of 133 man hours 
per acre for cotton production, the high- 
est for any crop commonly grown in the 
South. At the same time, the value of 
farm machinery per crop acre in the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta is |7.68, while 
the average for the United States is 
$10.12. Although it is well known that 
a family can produce more cotton than 
it can harvest, and it is conceded that 
mechanical pickers would help to in- 
crease capacity and efficiency when used 
to pick this excess production, it is never- 
theless evident that entire mechanized 
production of the crop is necessary. La- 
bor can not be subsidized on a yearly 
basis simply to produce the crop. These 
points were recognized by the Mississip- 
pi Legislature which made available a 
special fund for these studies for the bi- 
ennium July 1, 1944-June 30, 1946. 

Serious losses of labor to industry have 
greatly increased interest in the possi- 
bilities for complete mechanization of the 
cotton crop. Competition from rayon 
and other synthetics is more than a threat. 
Regardless of labor shortages, of other 
competition, and the uncertainty of world 
trade adjustments, increased efficiency, 
with lowered costs of production, always 
mean greater profits to the producer. 
Better yielding varieties of cotton, bred 

i/A cooperative program between the U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture, Cotton Ginning Labo- 
ratory, Charles A. Bennett in charge of en- 
gineering, and Leo Gerdes in charge of fiber 
and cottonseed testing laboratories; and Delta 
Experiment Station.

Experiment Station, respectively. 



to meet demands of a more exacting 
trade, and mechanical production, go 
hand in hand with better fertility prac- 
tices and good management. 

At the end of the 1943 season, the first 
year that the "Sizz Weeder", or flame 
cultivator, was tested, it was concluded 
(2) that it offered the only promise at 
present for replacement of the hoe in the 
control of grass and weeds in cotton pro- 
duction. Improvements of the machine 
used in 1943 have been reported (2), (3). 
Experimental areas have been successfully 
picked by mechanical means over a per- 
iod of years at the Delta Station, and 
the mechanical picker has been steadily 
improved. An International Harvester 
Company cotton picker was purchased in 
1944 for these tests from the lot com- 
mercially available. 

The possibiHty of both the Internation- 
al Harvester Company's cotton picker 
and the flame cultivator becoming farm 
implements led the Delta Experiment 
Station in 1944 to undertake an exten- 
sive experimental program in the mechan- 
ical production of cotton. Involved in 
this program are all farm machines and 
cultural practices that may be made 
available to the cotton farmer and the 
various combinations of these machines 
for the complete mechanical production 
of a cotton crop. 

Realizing that an understanding of the 
effects of mechanization on lint quality 
is of great economic importance, and 
having at Stoneville modern facilities to 
study such effects, full advantage was 
taken in the planning and execution of 
the program by cooperation of the U. S. 
Cotton Ginning Laboratory, Bureau of 
Plant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural 
Engineering; the Fiber Laboratory of the 
Production and Marketing Administra- 
tion, United States Department of Agri- 
culture; and the Advisory Research Com- 
mittee of the Delta Council; and the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station. Also

realizing the difficulties of obtaining re- 
liable cost data while thus working on 
small areas, the Agricultural Economics 
Department of the main station was ask- 
ed to join in the program by cooperating 
with planters using mechanical pickers to 
obtain data on operational costs, and ef- 
fect of picking methods on values of 
commercial lots of cotton. 

Experimental Procedure 
This report gives data on results ob- 
tained from various cultural and har- 
vesting methods used in production and 
harvesting cotton in 1944. Comparisons 
made in the experiment were: 

(1) Cotton cross-plowed to a checked 
stand versus drilled cotton; 

(2) Flamed cotton versus hoed (plan- 
tation practice); 

(3) Defoliated versus undefoliated; 
and 

(4) Hand - picked versus machine- 
picked cotton. 

The design of the experiment was a 
four by four Latin square replicated once, 
giving eight replications to the whole plot 
treatments. Each whole plot was "split" 
twice, once for the flaming versus hoe- 
ing comparisons, and once for the hand- 
picking versus machine-picking compari- 
sons. The whole plot comparisons were 
the four possible combinations of checked 
versus drilled and defoliated versus un- 
defoliated cotton. The whole plots were 
107 feet long and 16 rows wide, with 
four border rows on either side, and alley- 
ways for turning between blocks The 
rows were 40 inches wide. 

The cotton was drilled on low beds. 
To obtain the checked stand of cotton, 
the drilled rows were cross-plowed with 
a four-row cultivator using disc-hillers in 
the first cross-plowing. Setting the disc- 
hillers to throw away from each other, 
the hills can be cut to the desired length 
without injuring the plants left in the 
hills. Lapping of one or two rows is 
necessary to give accuracy to the row 
widths. The cultivator was set on 40-mch 
centers, thus no changing of the setting 



of the cultivator was necessary when 
shifting from cultivation with the rows 
to cross-plowing, i. e., cross-cultivation. 

In the cross-planted cotton no addition- 
al thinning was done, or was necessary, 
cither in plots where it was hoed or plots 
flamed for the control of grass and weeds. 
The cross-plowed plots were cultivated or 
flamed the same number of times as the 
drilled cotton, and were cross-plowed ev- 
ery other cultivation except the last two 
times when they w^ere plowed with the 
rows. The cotton in the cross-plowed, 
flamed, machine-picked plots was pro- 
duced entirely by machinery with no hand 
work whatsoever. 

Thinning of the plots on which the cot- 
ton was left in the drill was accomplished 
in two ways: First, thinned and hoed by 
hand as in regular plantation practice; 
and second, thinned by mechanical chop- 
ping. In the latter plots, the stand was 
thinned by using the Dixie cotton chop- 
per. Field conditions were not favorable 
for the efficient operation of this chop- 
per; consequently, some hand work was 
necessary in getting the desired stand of 
cotton. All subsequent control of grass 
and weeds was by flaming. 

The plots were further divided and half 
of each plot was hand picked and half 
was machine picked. 

Yields of Seed Cotton 

Table 1 gives data for seed cotton and 
lint as they are affected by the several 
methods of management. Yields of seed 
cotton are given in pounds per acre, and 
have all been increased by 10 percent 
from their oven-dry, trash-free weights to 
bring hand-picked d^nd machine-picked 
cotton to a uniform moisture basis. The 
yield of checked cotton was above that of 
drilled cotton. Although the difference 
between the two yields is significant, 
checked , cotton would not always be ex- 
pected to out-yield drilled cotton. In 
1944 an extended drought developed dur- 
ing the period of growth when the plants 
were fruiting most abundantly. The ef- 
fect of dry weather may have been more

severe on drilled cotton, due to a great- 
er number of plants per acre, than for 
that which was checked. 

Although there was a difJerence in 
yield between defoliated and undefoliat- 
ed, also between hoed and flamed plots, 
these differences were too small to be 
significant. 

Table 2 refers to machine-picked plots, 
only. Segments of rows, 20 feet in 
length, were gleaned by hand to deter- 
mine picker efficiency. More cotton was 
obtained by hand picking in every com- 
parison. The machine picked a little 
more efficiently in drilled than in check- 
ed cotton. Picker efficiency was prob 
ably reduced in this test by the droughty 
condition of the cotton and by the va- 
riety used. Constant attention will have 
to be given in the future to development 



of best design of spindle, wetting agents 
for the spindles, and to varieties best 
adapted to machine picking. 

It has been pointed out above that 
this cotton grew under droughty condi- 
tions and many bolls opened prematurely 
with hard, undeveloped locks. This type 
of lock was not picked as readily as ma- 
ture cotton. In fields of more normal 
growth, the picking percentage by the 
machine should be higher. 

Seed Cotton Moisture 

The moisture content of seed cotton 
in this experiment was unusually high; 
particularly is this true of the machine- 
picked cotton. The picker was new and 
somewhat more water was necessary in 
cleaning the picking spindles than was 
used in later pickings. The moisture con- 
tent of seed cotton was not significantly

different for drilled or checked cotton, 
or for hoed or flamed, when comparisons 
are confined to either hand or machine 
picking. 

Defoliation significantly reduced mois- 
ture content below that for undefoliated 
seed cotton. In taking the leaves off with 
"Aero Cyanamid," transpiration is either 
stopped or greatly reduced. Bolls open 
more rapidly and dry faster on defoliated 
plants, because air and sunlight pass 
through the plants more rapidly. 

Machine picking greatly increased the 
moisture content of seed cotton, as it 
is necessary to keep the spindles of the 
machine moistened at all times while the 
machine is being operated. The added 
moisture helps to clean the spindles so 
that they do not become gummed by 
juices from the plants and lose their 
picking aggressiveness. 

Foreign-Matter Content 

Foreign-matter content of seed cotton 
was affected only by methods of picking. 
Machine picking greatly increased the 
foreign-matter content, as reflected in 
commercial grade of lint and amount of 
waste in spinning, which will be discuss- 
ed later. Table 3 shows a significant in- 
teraction between defoliation and pick- 
ing. Hand picking of defoliated cotton 
gives a higher foreign-matter content than 
hand picking of undefoliated cotton, while 
the reverse is found for machine picking. 
This would seem to be due to relative 
amounts of dried and green leaves taken 
in the two methods of picking. Dried 
leaves which hang in the plant following 
defoliation are the only hazard to hand 
picking, while both green and dried leaves 
affect machine picking. Defoliation prob- 
ably increases the amount of dried leaves 
for both hand and machine picking, but 



it materially reduces the total of green 
and dried leaves taken by the machine. 
Defoliation may in this way tend to re- 
duce the grade on the one hand, and in- 
crease it on the other; completeness of 
defoliation would seem to be the control- 
ling factor. 

Staple Length and Grade 

A difference in staple length existed 
only between drilled and checked cotton, 
as given in table 1. This was accom- 
panied by significantly greater yields from 
checked plots, and correlates with greater 
vegetative vigor observed for checked cot- 
ton than for drilled cotton, for this sea 
son and location. 

The numerical grade is the average for 
two commercial classers. The grades were 
given numerical values so they could be 
averaged and statistically analyzed. The 
following tabulation gives the numerical 
assignment to grade: 

3. Good middling 

4. Strict middling 

5. Middhng 

6. Strict low middling 

7. Low middling 

8. Strict good ordinary 

9. Good ordinary 
10. Ordinary 

Although the grade for checked was 
superior to the grade for drilled cotton, 
the difference was small and was prob- 
ably due to causes which would be less 
significant under more normal seasonal 
conditions and farm practices. Checked 
cotton was more vigorous during the dry 
weather and set bolls for a short pe- 
riod after the drilled cotton had stopped 
fruiting, therefore was later in opening. 
Thus, the checked cotton was exposed 
to the weather for a somewhat shorter 
period.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 423 



Defoliated cotton was on the average 
0.3 of one grade superior to undefoliat- 
ed cotton. This improvement was entire- 
ly due to machine picking as will be 
pointed out later. 

Machine-picked cotton averaged 2.9 
grades below hand-picked cotton. The 
grade of machine-picked cotton was con- 
trolled by leaf or foreign-matter content, 
and gives an interaction picture similar 
to that of foreign matter (table 3). 

Table 4 shows a significant interaction 
for grade, as aflected by picking and 
defoliation. Defoliation reduced hand- 
picked cotton by 0.1 of a grade, an 
amount not significant; but defoliation 
improved hand-picked cotton by 0.7 of 
a grade, and an amount which is highly 
significant. 

Lint Quality 

Fibrograph data for lint, as shown in 
table 1, is a measure of staple length and 
uniformity. Following is a quotation ex 
plaining the meaning of the several fibei 
measurements made (4): 

"Fiber-length Cfibrograph"). These tests pro 
vide measures of fiber length as determined by 
the fibrograph which is a photo-electric device 
for measuring the length and length distribution 
of the fibers in a sample of cotton. The 'upper 
half mean length,' as determined by this instru- 
ment, provides a measure of the average length 
of all fibers longer than the mean length, express- 
ed in terms of decimal fractions of an inch. 
Although the 'upper half mean length' is closely 
related to the classer's designation of staple 
length, it may vary from that value because of 
fiber characteristics other than length which may 
be taken into account by the classcr. 'Mean 
length' is the average length of all fibers in the 
sample, excluding those shorter than % inch. 

"The 'uniformity ratio' expresses the relation 
between the mean length of the fibers and the 
upper half mean length, and provides a relative 
measure of the length uniformity of the fibers. 
The larger the figure reported, the more uniform 
the fiber length. For practical purposes, com- 



parisons between samples may be made accord- 
ing to the following descriptive designations: 
Uniformity ratio 
Above 80 — Uniform in fiber length 
76 - 80 — Average uniformity 
71-75 — Slightly irregular in fiber length 
70 and below — Irregular in fiber length 
"The uniformity ratio, as determined from 
fibrograph data, is not strictly comparable with 
coefficient of variation based on the sorter ar- 
ray. The latter is based on all fibers in the 
sample, whereas the fibrograph disregards fibers 
shorter than 54 inch." 

The fibrograph upper-half mean show- 
ed checked cotton to be longer than drill- 
ed cotton; the cotton classer's data showed 
the same trend, as pointed out previously. 
Mean length measurements gave a highly 
significantly greater value for checked cot- 
ton. These points will be discussed fur- 
ther under spinning value. 

The uniformity ratio and Pressley index 
both showed a significant difference be- 
tween hand- and machine-picked cotton. 

The percentage of moisture in Hnt cot- 
ton from drilled plots was below that from 
checked plots for both hand and machine 
picking, as shown in table 5. Also, as 
given in table 6, the percentage of mois- 
ture in lint was lower for defoliated than 
undefoliated plots, for both hand and ma- 
chine picking. In the case of defohated, 
and probably in the case of drilled cotton, 
the lower moisture content can be explain- 
ed on the basis of the period of time the 
cotton had been open when picked. 
Seed Studies 

Moisture content of seed was reduced 
by defoliation, and was higher where ma- 
chine picking was used. The explanation 
for variations of moisture in seed are the 
same as those given for variations found 
in seed cotton. 

The second column of table 8 gives the 
percent of free fatty acid in the cottonseed

for the four comparisons. The difiFerence 
found for each comparison is highly 
significant. Free fatty acid in seed from 
checked cotton was one percent less than 
for drilled cotton; this was not due to 
lower moisture percentage, as there was 
no diflFerence in seed moisture content. 
Length of exposure in the field appears to 
be the only logical explanation of this 
difference, as the drilled cotton had been 
open somewhat longer in the field. M. L. 
Karon and A. M. Altschul (5) show there 



is a direct relationship between moisture 
percent, time in storage, and the rate of 
formation of free fatty acid in cottonseed. 

Free fatty acid of seed from undefoli- 
ated cotton was higher than from the de- 
foliated. This difference may be attribut- 
ed to the higher moisture content of the 
seed from undefoliated plants. Hand- 
picked cotton was lower in free fatty acid 
than machine-picked cotton; this would 
again seem to be a moisture factor. Seed 
from flamed cotton was lower in free

fatty acid than hoed cotton. Although 
the moisture percentage of seed, Hnt, and 
seed cotton for flamed plots was below 
that for hoed cotton, the diflFerence in no 
instance was great enough to reach sig- 
nificance. 

When all cases are considered, the dif- 
ferences in moisture contents give the best 
explanation of the differences in free fatty 
acid contents. The fact that moisture was 



applied to the spindles to permit proper 
functioning of the machine, emphasizes 
the necessity of immediate drying and 
ginning of machine-picked cotton. In- 
ability to do this immediately for large 
numbers of small lots of experimental 
cotton, with consequent deterioration of 
seed and lint, served to reduce quality of 
both by an undetermined amount. The 
lowering of grade of lint and seed due 



Mechanical production of cotton 



is 



to machine picking may, therefore, be 
greater in these tests than those found in 
commercial practice. 

The oil content of the seed was not 
affected by any of the comparisons made. 

Seed from checked plots had a consider- 
ably higher grade than those from drilled 
cotton; this grade difference is in keep- 
ing with the free fatty acid difference in- 
volved. Although there was a grade dif- 
ference between defoliated and undefoli- 
ated cotton, it was not enough to be 
significant. However, there appears to 
be some reason to believe that defoliation 
may improve seed grade if applied at 
the proper age of plants. This argument 
is substantiated by the significantly low- 
er free fatty acid and moisture content of 
seed from defoliated cotton. 

Flaming significantly improved the 
grade of seed as compared with hoeing. 
This is largely due to lower free fatty 
acid content of the seed. 

Machine picking significantly reduced 
the grade ot seed. Higher moisture and 
higher free fatty acid contents were the 
factors which contributed to the lowering 
of grade. 

Spinning Data 

Table 7 gives the spinning data for 
the four direct comparisons made in the 
experiment. Waste removed by picker 
and card was very high in all samples of 
this test. As was pointed out above, this 
cotton was grown under drought condi- 
tions. There were more dead leaves lodg- 
ed in the plants than would be normally 
expected, as defoliation is difficult to ac- 
complish under such conditions, and dead 
leaves in the plants add greatly to the 
foreign matter of the lint of either hand- 
or machine-picked cotton. 

The picker and card waste for machine- 
picked cotton was approximately double 
that of hand-picked, and was higher than 
in previous tests. The following tabula- 



tion is taken from Delta Experiment Sta- 
tion Service Sheet No. 364.

Although there was a slight difference 
in neps per square inch, those differences 
are not considered significant. 

Yarn strength for checked cotton was 
stronger than for drilled cotton for 20s, 
44s, and 60s, and the "appearance" for 
all three sizes was equal. Greater 
strength of checked cotton was probably 
due to the extra length, as indicated by 
the classer's staple length, fibrograph up- 
per half mean, and mean length. De- 
foliation and flaming apparently did not 
affect the spinning value of the lint. 

Machine-picked cotton produced a 
stronger yarn than hand-picked cotton. 
The Pressley index indicated a shghtly 
stronger fiber, with no difference in staple 
length for machine-picked cotton as com- 
pared with hand-picked. The removal of 
the picker and card waste may have tak- 
en out short fibers which would help to 
account for additional strength. Also, 
about 22 percent (table 2) of the cot-i 
ton was left in the field by the mechanical 
picker. Underdeveloped, immature locks 
were included in the cotton left, which 
gave shorter but slightly stronger fiber. 
The fibrograph measurement of upper 
half mean of machine- and hand-picked 
cotton was 1.00 and 0.99 (table 1) as com- 
pared with 0.91 (table 9) for the glean- 
ing behind the machine. The Pressley 
index for machine-picked cotton was 7.5 
as compared with 7.7 for the gleanings. 
This staple length difference was equal 
to about 3/32 of an inch and greatly in- 
fluenced the spinning value of the cotton. 
The additional Pressley strength of the 
gleaning was not sufficient to affect the 
reduced length, both of which affect spin- 
ning value.

TIME EXPENDITURES IN HOMEMAKING ACTIVITIES 

BY WHITE AND NEGRO TOWN FAMILIES 

By DOROTHY DICKINS 
Head, Home Economics Department 



In the summer of 1943, 160 white and 
Negro homemakers residing in Mississip- 
pi towns, kept records for one week of 
how they used their time and the assist- 
'ance they received in homemaking activ- 
ities, in connection with a food prepara- 
tion study to be reported in other bul- 
letins of the Mississippi Agricultural Ex- 
periment Station. It is the purpose of 
this report to show time spent in various 
homemaking activities by the homemak- 
ers and in the families included in this 
study. To what extent was homemaking 
a part time job^for these groups? What 
were time costs of various homemaking 
activities? What are the possibilities for 
reducing time spent? These are ques- 
tions with which this report will be con- 
cerned- 

The large group of young women mar- 
ried during the war and with husbands 
now returning might profit by studying 
time expenditures of these homemaker?^ 
and their famiHes. Such data may as- 
sist in helping to decide whether gain- 
ful work shoujd be continued now that 
the new job of homemaking has been as- 
sumed. 

Time Expenditure Records 

Each homemaker was asked to keep a 
record of activities and assistance in home 
making activities during the week in 
which food preparation records were be- 
ing kept. White and Negro home eco- 
nomics teachers supervised record keep- 
ing. The same type of schedule and the 
methods of classification of time develop- 
ed by the Bureau of Home Economics 
(now the Bureau of Human Nutrition 
and Home Economics) in their time 
studies were used in this study. 

Description of Families and 
Schooling of Homemakers 

The families in this study were select- 



ed from families included in a survev 
made in Ackerman, Eupora, and Marks, 
Mississippi, [The survey included all fam- 
ilies in the towns (a) eating meals at 
home, (b) with a female homemaker, 
(c) no more than one boarder. Informa- 
tion was secured from 94 percent of the 
eligible families.] Two groups each of 
white and Negro families were taken: 
80 white families with monthly rent or 
rental value of house, apartment, or 
rooms (unfurnished) of $20.00 or less 
and of $20.01 to $40.00; 80 Negro fam- 
ilies with monthly rent or rental value of 
house, apartment, or rooms (unfurnish- 
ed) of $7.50 or less and of $7.51 to 
$20.00. Families with higher housing 
values were not included in this record 
sample, since such families comorised 
only 8 percent of the white and 0.2 per- 
cent of the Negro families in the survey 
from which the sample was taken. 

About 40 families in each of the four 
groups were selected, since the purpose 
of the record study was to determine 
some of the factors causing variation in 
activities, such as socioeconomic status 
and race. In the survey, 44 percent of 
the white families had housing values of 
$20.00 or less, and 48 percent of $20.01 
to $40.00, while 62 percent of the Negro 
families had housing values of $7.50 or 
less, and 38 percent of $7.51 to $20.00. 

The families of white homemakers of 
this study averaged 3.5 members, of Neg- 
roes 3.6 members. Median size of fam- 
ily (the size half way between the larg- 
est and smallest) for both whites and 
Negroes was 3 members. Thirty-nine 
percent of the families in both white and 
Negro groups were families in which all 
members were over 15 years of age. 
Thirty-five percent of the white families 
and 28 percent of the Negro families had 
one or more children 5 years and under. 



4 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 424 



while 26 percent of the white families and 
33 percent of the Negro famiHes had no 
child 5 years or under, but had children 
6 to 15 years of age. Eight white fam- 
ilies and seven Negro families had chil- 
dren under a year of age. The presence 
of children, as well as their age, is, of 
course, an important factor in time ex- 
penditures in homemaking activities. 

Twenty-six of the 80 white homemak- 
ers and six of the 80 Negro homemakers 
had had college training. Eighteen of 
the Negro homemakers and one of the 
white homemakers had had six grades 
of schooling or less. The fact that there 
were 19 women with such limited school- 
ing willing to cooperate in this study 
was because other members of their fam- 
ilies with more schooling were willing 
to keep the records for ihem or because 
they had continued their education by 
reading. The median grade completed 
by the white homemakers of this study 
was the twelfth, and by Negro home- 
makers the eighth. Median grade of 
school completed by white homemakers 
in the survey was likewise the twelfth. 
However, Negro homemakers in the sur- 
vey had completed a median of only the 
sixth grade. 

How Homemakers Used Their Time 

In table 1 is shown the average time 
during one week given to work and to 
personal activities by white and Negro 
• homemakers in families of varying hous- 
ing values. The most interesting thing 
about this table is not the differences in 
the use of time (white homemakers av- 
eraged somewhat less time in work ac- 
tivities, more time in personal activities 
than did Negro homemakers), but the 
similarities in the use of time. About 
one-third of the 168-hour week was de- 
voted to work by all four groups, about 
four-tenths to sleep ajid rest, and the re- 
mainder to other personal activities- 
Work included homemaking, food pro- 
duction for home use, and gainful work. 
As used in this discussion, the term 



homemaking applies to activities connect- 
ed with housekeeping and management 
of the homemaker's own household and 
the care of its members, together with go- 
ing to places and returning home in con- 
nection with homemaking activities. Food 
production included activities done for 
homemaker's own household use, such as 
milking, care of milk, making butter, 
care of poultry, care of garden, gathering 
vegetables. Food preservation, such as 
canning, preserving, and pickling, was 
classified as a homemaking activity, not 
as food production. Gainful work was 
work for which the homemaker received 
pay and help which the homemaker gave 
to members of her household in work 
for which they received pay. Some of 
the gainful work engaged in by home- 
makers during the week of the study 
was clerical work, cleaning work, teach- 
ing music, laundry work, sewing, help- 
ing husband at store, milking, picking 
cotton, and beauty parlor work. 

All homemakers of this study spent 
some time in homemaking activities. All 
white homemakers except 17 (9 in the 
$20.00 and under housing group and 8 
in the $20.01 to $40.00 housing group), 
and all Negro homemakers except 13 (7 
in the $7.50 and under housing group 
and 6 in the $7.51 to $*20.00 housing 
group), spent sometime in food produc- 
tion. Of those homemakers engaging in 
food production, time spent per week 
varied from 15 minutes to 29 hours. 

Twenty-nine percent of the white 
homemakers and 53 percent of the Negro 
homemakers spent some time in gainful 
activities during the study week. Time 
spent in this way ranged from 30 min- 
utes to 47 hours and 45 minutes. Two 
homemakers, one white and one Negro, 
spent this maximum amount of time in 
gainful work. 

Homemakers in all four groups spent 
more time in food homemaking activi- 
ties than in any other type of woik ac- 
tivities (table 1). There was litde dif- 
ference in time expenditure for food

homemaking by the four groups of 
homemakers. Time spent in other home- 
making activities took second place, and 
varied from an average of 18 hours and 
36 minutes in the group of white home- 
makers in famihes of $20.01 to $40.00 
housing value, to 23 hours and 6 min- 
utes in the group of white homemakers 
in families of $20.00 and under housing 
value. 

Gainful work played a relatively more 
important role in the work week of the 
Negro woman than of the white woman, 
average time expenditures being twice as 
great. White and Negro cooperators in 
families of higher housing value spent 
more time producing food for home use 



than did white and Negro homemakers 
in families of lower housing value. 

Figure 1 gives the variation in the work 
period of the four groups of homemakers 
during the week of the study. As will 
be noted, the majority of cooperators in 
every group worked more than 50 hours 
a week. Seven of the 80 white women 
and 18 of the 80 Negro women worked 
70 hours or more. The minimum time 
spent in work activities by a cooperator 
of this study was 27 hours and 48 min- 
utes, the maximum time 83 hours. The 
family in which the homemaker spent 
so little working time was a white fam- 
ily of husband and wife only. The wife 
did not have gainful work nor did she

family in which the homemaker spent 83

family in which the wife spent 42 hours

In some of the time given to activi- 
ties classified as personal, the homemaker 
was not entirely free from homemaking 
responsibilities, as for instance, she may 
have been reading and at the same time 
giving some attention to children. In

fact, some of these homemakers scarcely 
knew the meaning of "free" time. Per- 
sonal activities included sleep and rest, 
leisure activities, personal care of self, 
and any other personal activities. 

About one-fifth of the personal time of 
women in this study was devoted to leis- 
ure activities (table 1). Sleep and rest 
took about 65 percent of this personal 
time, and personal care of self the re- 
mainder. White homemakers in families 
of $20.01 to $40.00 housing value averag- 
ed less time in sleep and rest and more 
in leisure and personal care of self; Negro 
homemakers in families of $7.50 and un- 
der housing value averaged more time 
in sleep and rest and less in leisure and 
personal care of self activities. The group 
averaging the greatest number of hours 
in work activities average the smallest 
number of hours in leisure time activi- 
ties, and the group averaging the small- 
est number of hours in work activities 
averaged the greatest number of hours in 
leisure time activities. However, the dif- 
ferences were small. 

All groups of homemakers averaged 
more time in informal social Hfe (that 
is, talking with members of their own 



families, with neighbors, relatives and 
other friends in their homes or visiting 
in homes of neighbors, relatives or friends, 
or visiting in town) than in any other 
type of leisure activity. A great deal of 
the visiting, since it was summer time, 
occurred on the front porch, or out in 
the yard (table 2). 

Reading was of next importance as a 
leisure time activity for white cooperators, 
"meetings and study" for Negro co- 
operators. Several Negro homemakers 
attended all day church meetings. Sev- 
eral attended rather frequently "protract- 
ed meetings" that happened to be going 
on at the time of this study. This ac- 
counts for their greater time expendi- 
tures in ''meetings and study" than is 
the case of the white groups. 

"Meetings and study" was almost al- 
together time spent in church activities. 
The fact that records were kept during 
summer when school and a number of 
other organized groups do not ordinarily 
hold meetings may account for so few 
of these activities appearing on the rec- 
ords. 

From a study of activities of home- 
makers, it is quite evident that the church

is a leading social institution. Included 
in church activities hy homemakers of 
this study were socials as well as meet- 
ings. Among church activities listed 
were preaching service, Sunday School, 
prayer meeting, women's missionary so- 
ciety, young people's unions, church con- 
ventions, business women's circle, bap- 
tizing, ice cream suppers, fish frys, and 
choir rehearals. Work for organiza- 
tions, in all cases except with the white 
group of $20.01 to $40.00 housing, was 
in connection with the church. Several 
women in this group did Red Cross 
work. 

Reading the newspaper was the type of 
reading most often nientioned, and listen- 
ing to the news was the kind of program 
most often listed in connection with the 
radio. When homemaking was combin- 
ed with listening to the radio, as for ex- 
ample, shelling peas and listening to the 
radio, the homemaker was classified as 
shelling peas or as sewing. 

Included in the "all other and unspeci- 
fied" leisure time activities are activities 
such as cooperating in this study, games 
(such as checkers, rummy, bridge), sports, 
outings, playing the piano. Only three 
homemakers, all of them white women, 
spent time in sports. One went horse- 



back riding with her husband, and two 
went swimming. 

Miscellaneous activities included those 
appearing on records of cooperators 
which could be classified neither as home- 
making nor as personal activities and in- 
cluded less than 1 percent of the time of 
the average homemaker. 

Homemaking Activities of Home- 
makers 

As will be noted in figure 2, all four 
groups of cooperating women averaged 
more time in homemaking than the 40 
hours a week now advocated for govern- 
ment and other workers. The 40-hour 
week for government and other workers 
does not include, however, time spent in 
going to and returning from work, a 
time expenditure homemakers do not 
have. It would, therefore, seem that 
time expenditures for homemaking were 
not on the average excessive. But home- 
making did constitute a full time job, 
especially for white women in the lower 
value group, and Negro women in the 
higher housing value group. These were 
the two groups, as may be recalled, which 
most often had young children. 

The important consideration is, how- 
ever, not the average homemaking week, 
but how many homemakers in each group

exceeded this average. No standard has 
yet been set for a reasonable work week 
for the homemaker, but perhaps it would 
be agreed that more than 56 hours (8 
hours a day for 7 days) would be exces- 
sive, and that less than 40 hours a week 
would be unduly low. Within this range 
of 40 to 56 hours of what might be con- 
sidered a full-time job, about 38 percent 
of the white cooperators and 45 percent 
of the Negro cooperators would fall in 
this class. Thirty percent of the white 
cooperators and 2 percent of the Negro 
cooperators would be classed as over- 
worked homemakers. About one-third 
in each group would be giving less than 
full time to homemaking. 

A comparison of time expenditures for 
homemaking during the entire week and 
during the Monday through Friday pe- 
riod shows how drastically homemaking 
activities were curtailed over the week- 
end (table 3). This was done to make 
possible participation in church activi- 
ties, visiting or being visited by relatives 
and friends. Several homemakers spent 
no time in leisure actvities except over 
the week-end. There was little, if any, 
evidence that overworked women used 
the week-end to catch up with their 
work. 

Food homemaking activities of home- 
makers. All homemakers of this study 
spent some time during the record week 
in food homemaking activities. Time 
spent per cooperator ranged from SYz to 
50 X hours. The woman spending the 



maximum time was in a white family in 
which there were adults only. She had 
no assistance in food homemaking ac- 
tivities and canned several foods during 
the record week. 

More than half of time spent in food 
homemaking activities by women in all 
four groups was spent in preparation of 
meals (table 4.) Clearing away after 
meals took about half the time that prep- 
aration for meals did. Preservation of 
food (including preparation and clearing 
away ) was of next importance with white 
homemakers. Negro homemakers spent 
about as much time in food purchasing 
as they did in food preservation. 

Forty-one of the 80 white cooperators 
and 28 of the 80 Negro cooperators spent 
some time in food preservation during 
the^ week of the study. These records, 
with the exception of five, were kept dur- 
ing the main canning season. Then, too, 
canning for home consumption to con- 
serve the national food supply was being 
stressed for non-farm as well as for farm 
homemaker. The maximum time spent 
in food preservation was 22 hours and 
45 minutes by a white homemaker. This 
cooperator devoted practically all of one 
day and part of two others to canning 
peaches and apples. At 8:00 a.m. on the 
first day she started out with washing 
fruit jars and finished at 8:45 p.m. with 
50 quarts of peaches canned. On this 
day she had had the help of a Negro 
woman for 8 hours.

homemakers in the $20.00 and under 
housing value group averaged more time 
in preparing and clearing away meals 
than did white homemakers in the $20.01 
to $40.00 housing value group. They 
had also received somewhat more assist- 
ance in these activities. It is probable 
that the higher housing value group had 
better equipment and could, therefore, do 
this work more quickly. Seventy-two per- 
cent of them used electric, gas or oil cook- 
stoves, while only 56 percent in the lower 
housing white group used these facili- 
ties. Another factor may have been dif- 
ference in composition of families; the 
group requiring more time had the great- 
er percentage of young children. Other 
explanations for more time by the lower 
housing group might be differences in 
menus, in methods of cooking, in kitchen 
arrangement, in kind and condition of 
cooking utensils, and in enjoyment of 
food homemaking activities. These fac- 
tors will be considered in a future pub- 
lication. 

That Negro women spent more time 
in preparing meals than did white wom- 
en can be accounted for in part by the 
difference in assistance received, the white 
woman more often receiving it. Anoth- 
er important factor undoubtedly, is the 
equipment with which they have to work. 



All Negro cooperators except one used 
wood and/or coal as cooking fuel. 

Other homemaking activities of home- 
makers. White cooperators with one or 
more children 5 years of age and under 
spent on an average 11 hours and 15 min- 
utes in care of children, while white co- 
operators with children of 6 to 15 years 
only spent 2 hours and 34 minutes. Time 
spent by Negro cooperators with young 
children was 12 hours and 22 minutes, 
with older children 20 minutes. The 
fact that more white homemakers in the 
$20 00 and under housing group had 
young children than homemakers in 
the other three groups, therefore, acounts 
for greater time given by this group to 
care of children than by the other three 
groups (table 5). Under care of chil- 
dren is included physical care and such 
other direct care as teaching, supervising, 
and amusing. 

About one-half of the white homemak- 
ers with older children only (6 to 15 
years) and three-fourths of the Negro 
homemakers with older children only, re- 
corded no time in care of children during 
the week of the study. Need for care 
of older children was less, of course, dur- 
ing the summer when these records were 
kept, since the children were not going 
to jchool. Then, too, much of the child

II 



care of older children is incidental to 
other tasks. A part of this care was un- 
doubtedly classified as a leisure time ac- 
tivity of the homemaker (perhaps as "in- 
formal social life"). 

All four groups of homemakers aver- 
aged one-half hour or more in care of 
others (table 5). "Others" was in most 
cases their husband, and care included 
activities such as assembling husband's 
clothing, taking dinner to his place of 
business, and nursing him during illness. 

Laundering was "the other homemak- 
ing activity" that consumed the most 
time of Negro cooperators (table 5), Av- 
erage time spent in daily and weekly 
cleaning by the white cooperator was 
greater than average time spent in laun- 
dering. The majority of white women 
either hired a woman to assist in laun- 



dry work or sent clothing and house- 
hold textiles away from home to be 
laundered. Even so, during summer 
weather when most of these records were 
kept, the heavy demand for fresh gar- 
ments usually necessitated a certain 
amount of laundry work on the part of 
the homemaker. Only six of the 80 
white homemakers spent no time in 
laundry work during the week of the 
study. One of these women was in the 
$20.00 and under housing value group, 
and five were in the |20.01 to $40.00 
housing group. One factor leading to 
greater average expenditures in launder- 
ing by white women in the $20.00 and 
under housing group than in the $20.01 
to $40.00 housing group, was that the 
families in the former group had more 
young children. One Negro cooperator

in the $7.50 and under housing group 
and two in the $7.51 to $20.00 housing 
group recorded no time in laundry work 
during the study. 

Time spent in daily and weekly clean- 
ing averaged more than five hours a week 
for white homemakers and more than 
four hours for Negro homemakers. Three 
white women and four Negro women de- 
voted no time during the week to activi- 
ties in this category. Daily and weekly 
cleaning included cleaning and straighten- 
ing in connection with the house itself, 
such as making beds, changing beds, 
mopping, dusting, vacuum cleaning, and 
scrubbing bath tub. 

That Negro wom"en spent less time 
than white women in daily and weekly 
cleaning was not because they had more 
help. Average assistance in daily and 
weekly cleaning was for white cooper- 
ators 3 hours and 40 minutes; for Negro 
cooperators 1 hour and 26 minutes. Dif- 
ference in time expenditures in daily and 
weekly cleaning of the white and Negro 
group may be accounted for in part by 
smaller houses of the Negro. There may 
have been a difference in standards of 
cleanliness in the two groups. 

The homemaking activities which in- 
cluded sewingj mending, care of cloth- 
ing, and fancy work were of fourth im- 
portance to all groups of homemakers ex- 
cept white homemakers from families of 
$20.01 to $40.00 housing value. They 
were second in importance to these (table 
5). Thirty-two and 30 percent of the 
lower housing value white and Negro 
cooperators, respectively, did not spend 
any time in these activities; 21 and 24 
percent of the higher housing value white 
and Negro cooperators did not spend 
any time. Negro women spent more time 
in mending than did white women. Only 
six women spent time in "fancy work" 
for the family. 

Homemakers averaged from one-half 
hour to one hour in purchasing and plan- 
ning for goods other than food (table 5). 



Included in these activities is time spent 
going and returning in connection with 
purchasing, since such time is generally 
a necessary part of purchasing. 

Effect of Gainful Work on Home- 
maker's Use of Time 
Gainful work seemed to reduce time 
spent in homemaking activities more than 
it did time spent in personal activities 
(table 6). Gainful workers received more 
assistance in homemaking activities than 
did non-gainful workers, but the extra 
assistance they received was less than the 
extra time in homemaking activities of 
non-gainful workers. Homemakers with 
gainful work less often had young chil- 
dren and, therefore, their homemaking 
time requirements were less. However, 
composition of the family the same, it 
seems that somewhat less time was being 
spent in homemaking activities in homes 
of gainfully employed women. Were 
their homemaking standards lower or 
their equipment superior? Had they 
found short-cuts that might well be adopt- 
ed by the non-gainful homemaker house- 
hold? Were they more efficient work- 
ers? Had making or doing it in the 
home been replaced to a greater extent 
with buying it on the market? All of 
these are questions worth consideration. 
"Some Contrasts in the Levels of Liv- 
ing of Women Engaged in Farm, Tex- 
tile Mill, and Garment Plant Work," a 
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion bulletin by the writer, gives some in- 
formation on few of them. More in- 
formation is needed on how the gainful 
worker homemaker and her family do 
manage. 

About twice as many in the gainful- 
worker-homemaker group contained chil- 
dren 6 to 15 years old than in the non- 
gainful-worker-homemaker group. Evi- 
dently, pressure for additional income 
was great in such families. Then, too, 
older children require relatively little act- 
ual physical care from their mothers.

an seemed to affect time expenditures in 
care of older children more than it did 
that of younger children. The reverse 
was the case in Negro families. Older 
Negro children seemed to get very little 
care from their mothers, whether gain- 
fully employed or not- The number of 
cases is, however, small. 

In figure 3 the average number of 
hours per week spent in three types of 
activities by white and Negro home- 
makers in the non-gainful and gainful 
worker group are shown. Of the three 
activities listed — food homemaking, oth- 
er homemaking, and leisure — time ex- 
penditures in other homemaking seemed 
most affected by gainful work. The gain- 
ful-worker-homemaker spent about 7 



hours a week less than the non-gainful 
worker-homemaker on such activities. 
Set Time for Doing Tasks 

To what extent did homemakers of 
this study have a set time for doing 
household tasks? An answer to this ques- 
tion is especially important to home eco- 
nomists who are desirous of assisting 
homemakers to plan more effective use of 
time. Where there is a set time for doing 
tasks, there would probably be more dif- 
ficulty in assisting homemakers in their 
problems of time scheduling. The impor- 
tant consideration is a flexible plan that 
makes greatest satisfaction to the family 
for the time used.

earliest and latest time homemakers start-

ed dinner preparation and cleaning house 
is given. As will be noted, very few 
homemakers had a set time for starting 
these two tasks. Cleaning house was 
more often done at a set time than was 
preparing dinner. There was a tendency 



to have a set time for doing these tasks 
for homemakers in higher housing groups 
more often than for homemakers in low- 
er housing groups. 

In a few of the homes time of serv- 
ing dinner varied considerably — one day

around noon, another day at 4:30 p.m., 
one day at noon, another at 6:00 or 6:30 
p.m. This variation in time of serving 
accounted for some of the variation of 
more than two hours in starting prepara- 
tion. Negro famiUes were less Hkely to 
have a set time for eating dinner than 
white families. However, there was less 
variation in time of starting to clean 
house in the Negro than in the white 
group. But nearly one-half of the Negro 
homem.akers did not clean house as often 
as four of the five week days and their 
records were not included in this tabula- 
tion. 

Assistance Received by Homemakers 
in Homemaking Activities 

White homemakers received on an av- 
erage more assistance in homemaking, but 
more individual Negro homemakers re- 
ceived help in homemaking. Average 
number of hours of assistance in home- 
making received by white cooperators in 
the $20.00 and under housing group was 
18.2; by those in the $20.01 to $40.00 
housing group, 17.2; by Negro cooper- 
ators in the $7.50 and under housing 
group, 12.8; and by those in the $7.51 to 
$20.00 housing group, 11.2. Fifteen white 
homemakers and three Negro homemak- 
ers had no assistance at all in homemak- 
ing. 

In table 9 is listed the extent of assist- 
ance received *by homemakers in various 



homemaking activities. As will be noted, 
Negro homemakers received more assist- 
ance in care of house, while white home- 
makers received more assistance in meal 
preparation and clearing away. Much of 
the assistance in care of house received by 
the Negro homemaker was in activities 
such as cutting wood, bringing in wood 
and coal, making fires, care of fires, carry- 
ing water. It was such activities as these 
that were responsible for the high propor- 
tion of Negro homemakers receiving some 
assistance in homemaking activities. Oft- 
entimes these were the only kinds of as- 
sistance they received. 

Negro as well as white cooperators 
more often had assistance in clearing away 
meals than in actual preparation of meals. 
Somewhat more than one-half of the 
white and Negro homemakers (53 and 
51 percent, respectively) had assistance 
in preparation of meals. Sixty-eight per- 
cent of the white cooperators and 59 per- 
cent of the Negro cooperators had assist- 
ance in clearing away meals. 

White homemakers had more assist- 
ance in laundering than Negro homemak- 
ers (table 9). This was because white 
women often hired laundry work done 
at home; Negro women did not. How- 
ever, assistance received in laundering 
shown in table 9 understates help which 
the white cooperators actually received, 
since it does not include time spent in

laundering clothing and household tex- 
tiles sent outside the home. Thirty-nine 
of the 80 white cooperators sent laundry 
out. No Negro cooperator did so (table 
10). 

Very few homemakers received help 
with sewing and mending or with man- 
agerial activities (table 9). Assistance in 
managerial activities was for the most 
part food purchasing. More Negro than 
white children shopped for their mothers. 



Assistance in "all other" was largely as- 
sistance in food preservation. 

White homemakers in families in the 
$20.00 and under housing group had 
more assistance in care of members, main- 
ly young children, than any other type 
of assistance. Assistance in meal prep- 
aration and clearing away and in care of 
house was greater for the other three 
groups. As will be recalled, 20 (or 48.8 
percent) of the families in the white

group with housing $20.00 and under had 
one or more children 5 years of age and 
under. Two of these famiHes hired a 
small Negro girl to play with and look 
after small children. 

Children were the main source of as- 
sistance in homemaking activities to 
Negro women, while hired help was more 
important to white women, especially in 
families with housing of $20.01 to $40.00 
(table 10). Assistance from children 
corresponded with presence of older chil- 
dren. The $7.50 and under housing 
group of Negroes had more families with 
children 6 to 15 years only than any oth- 
er group, and they averaged from 7 to 8 
hours assistance in homemaking activi- 
ties from children. The $20.00 and un- 
der housing group of whites had fewer 
families with children 6 to 15 years only 
and they averaged slightly less than 6 
hours assistance in homemaking activi- 
ties from children. 

Husbands in both white and Negro 
families of low housing value averaged 
about twice as much assistance in home- 
making activities as those in families of 
higher housing value. Principal home- 
making tasks in which husbands assist- 
ed were: care of children, getting in 
wood, carrying water, making fires, and 
care of lawn. 

Thirty-two percent of the white home- 
makers in families with housing $20.00 



and under, and 51 percent of the white 
homemakers in families with housing 
$20.01 to $40.00, hired some one to as- 
sist them in homemaking activities dur- 
ing the week of the study. Hired work- 
ers in 16 of the 33 families hiring work- 
ers during the study week were day or 
hour laborers. In 17 families, workers 
were hired on a weekly basis. Usually 
these regular workers were Negro wom- 
en, but not always so. One homemaker 
had a hired man who was responsible for 
indoor work, such as washing dishes and 
cleaning. In one case, a 12-year-old boy 
was used. Several cooperators had lit- 
tle Negro girls 10 or 12 years of age, 
who cared for the children, assisted in 
dishwashing and cleaning. 

The help hired to assist in homemak- 
ing activities at the time of this study 
was undoubtedly less than ordinary, since 
the study was made in the wartime pe- 
riod during which many workers in dom- 
estic service had gone into other lines of 
work or because of income received by 
other family members or from the gov- 
ernment made gainful work less neces- 
sary. 

The relation of number in family and 
of type of family to the amount of as- 
sistance received by homemaker in home- 
making activities is shown m tables 11 
and 12. Assistance received by homemak- 
er \n white and Negro families with

adults only, and in white and Negro 
families with one or more children 5 
years and under, are given in figures 4 
and 5. As will be noted, homemakers of 
larger families received considerably more 
assistance in homemaking than home- 
makers in smaller families (table 11). 
Sixty-sight percent of the homemakers in 
2-member white families and only 7 per- 
cent in more-than-4-member white fam- 
ilies received no assistance or less than 
5 hours assistance. The percentages for 
Negro homemakers in the two groups 
were 82 and 5, respectively- 
White homemakers in families of 



adults only were more "ikely to receive 
assistance in homemaking activities than 
Negro homemakers in families of adults 
only (table 12). Negro homemakers 
with children were more likely to re- 
ceive assistance. However, more white 
homemakers with children received a 
large amount of assistance than in the 
case of Negro homemakers. Homemak- 
ers in 21 percent of the white families 
with one or more children 5 years and 
under had more than 40 hours assistance 
in homemaking. The percentage for the 
Negro group with as much assistance 
was 13. 



20 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 424 



Assistance Received by Homemakers 
in Food Production for Home Use 

As will be noted in table 13, assistance 
in production of food for home use av- 
erage about three hours in white fam- 
ilies; about two and a half hours in Negro 
families. The husband was the main 
source of this assitance. However, hired 
help was almost as important a source 
for help as was the husband in food pro- 
duct'on in white families of $20.01 to 
$40.00 housing value. Children and oth- 
ers were relatively unimportant sources 
of assistance in all groups. 

Total Time on Homemaking 
Activities 

Average number of hours spent on all 
homemaking activities by all workers per 
family per week was for white families in 
the $20.00 and under housing group, 69; 



for white families in the $20.01 to $40.00 
housing group, 63; and for Negro fam- 
ilies in both housing groups, 60 hours. 
If the work week is regarded as 40 hours, 
then homemaking in these households 
claimed the full time of one worker and 
half time of another. Meal preparation 
and clearing away, care of house, launder- 
ing, and care of members were the im- 
portant homemaking tasks (table 14). 

Time expenditures on meal prepara- 
tion and clearing away were relatively 
more important in white families of 
$20.01 to $40.00 housing value, while 
care of house was relatively more impor- 
tant in Negro families of $7.50 and un- 
der housing. One of the main factors in 
the relatively high time expenditures in 
care of house by the low housing value 
Negro group was poor water facilities.

That laundering time expenditures in 
Negro families exceeded those in white 
families was, as has been previously ex- 
plained, because a number of white fam- 
ilies sent clothing and household textiles 
outside the home to be laundered. This 
was nearly twice as often the case with

lower housing value group (table 10). 
Then, too, facilities for laundering were 
poorer in Negro homes. Only one home- 
maker, a white woman, was listed as 
having an electric washing machine, but 
Negroes had fewer wash tubs, fewer elec- 
tric irons, a less convenient water supply, 
than did whites. 

A? will be noted in figures 6 and 7 
and in table 15, total time spent by all 
workers in homemaking and size of fam- 
ily are related. From 40.1 to 55 hours 
were spent per week in homemaking ac- 
tivities in the majority of 2-member fam- 
ilies, while in the majority of larger fam- 
ilies 55.1 to 70 hours were spent. More 
than 85 hours were not spent in home- 
making in a 2-member family, but in 18 
percent of the larger families more than 
85 hours were spent. 



Presence of young children increased 
greatly the total time spent by all work- 
ers in homemaking activities per family 
(table 16). About one-third of the white 
and Negro families with one or more 
children 5 years and under had total 
homemaking expenditures exceeding 85 
hours. Only 4 percent of the families in 
the other two groups averaged as much 
time.

How do the homemaking time patterns

*In Mississippi, municipalities of from 300 to 2,000 inhabitants are defined as towns. Munici- 
palities of 2,000 or more inhabitants are defined as cities. Villages have less than 300 inhabitants. 
Families in this study lived in towns of from 1,377 to 1,818, according to 1940 population

Hildegarde Kneeland of the U. S. Bu- 
reau of Home Economics, of families in 
New York, in the Middle West, and in 
three far Western states. 

These studies included families of the 
"middle class home." Table 17 gives the 
average time spent per week in various 
homemaking tasks by all workers per 
family in each of these two studies and 
in the Mississippi study. As will be not- 
ed, homemaking time patterns of these 
groups are rather similar. All groups av- 



eraged about 60 hours per week in 
homemaking activities. 

The greatest difference in time expendi- 
tures in various homemaking tasks in 
these four groups was the difference in 
time spent in care of members. Here the 
Mississippi white family averaged about 
9 hours, the Oregon family 6 hours, and 
the families studied by the Bureau about 
5 hours. Information is not available 
concerning the proportion of Bureau 
families including young children, but 
18 of the 61 Oregon families (30 per- 
cent) were "with children under 6 years

only." Twenty-four percent of the Mis- 
sissippi white families and 16 percent 
of the Mississippi ^egro families were 
of this type. It might be that because 
the Mississippi white homemaker could 
hire assistance at low cost, more time 
could be given to young children. An- 
other possibility is that new standards 
in child care have resulted in increased 
time spent in child care. 

Some of the differences in time spent 
in various activities by the four groups 
of families can be accounted for by the 
fact that the Mississippi study included 
for the most part summer-time records, 
the other studies time records in all sea- 
sons. Food preservation classed as an 
"all other" homemaking activity and oc- 
curring for the most part in the summers 
would account for the higher average ex- 
penditure on the part of Mississippi white 
families. Laundering requires more time 
in sumimer (especially in a climate such 
as Mississippi), but Mississippi white 
families averaged less time than Oregon 
and Bureau families because about one- 
half of them sent some or more of their 
clothing and household textiles away from 
home to be laundered. Differences in 
time expenditures in sewing and mend- 
ing may be due in part to season. An- 
other factor may be the trend towards 
less sewing at home. 

Summary and Conclusions 

In this study, time expenditures dur- 
ing one week of homemakers and of all 
workers in homemaking activities in 80 
white and 80 Negro town families of 
Mississippi, are analyzed. 

Methods which had been worked out 
by the Bureau of Home Economics for 
recording and analyzing time expendi- 
tures were used. White and Negro home 
economics teachers supervised record 
keeping. 

Thirty-nine percent of the white home- 
makers in families in the $20.00 and un- 
der housing group and 33 percent in fam- 
ilies m the 120.01 to $40.00 housing 



group spent 60 hours or more in work 
activities (homemaking activities, food 
production for home use, and gainful 
work). Fifty-one percent of the Negro 
homemakers in families in the $7.50 and 
under housing group and 54 percent in 
the $7.51 to $20.00 housing group spent 
this much time in work activities. Seven 
percent of the white homemakers in the 
$20.00 and under housing group and 8 
percent in the $20.01 to $40.00 housing 
group spent less than 40 hours in work 
activities. No Negro homemaker spent 
less than 40 hours in work activities. 

During the study week 38 percent of 
the white homemakers and 45 percent of 
the Negro homemakers spent from 40 to 
56 hours in homemaking activities. Thirty 
percent of the white group and 23 per- 
cent of the Negro group spent more 
time, and about one-third in each group 
less time. Homemaking activities were 
curtailed by both white and Negro wom- 
en on Saturday and Sunday, or over the 
week-end. 

More time was spent by all groups in 
food homemaking than all other home- 
making activities combined. More than 
half of the time spent in food homemak- 
ing activities (preparing all meals, clear- 
ing away all meals, refreshments for so- 
cial affairs, preservation of food, food 
purchasing and planning) was spent in 
preparing meals. 

Laundering was the "other homemak- 
ing activity" that consumed the most 
time of Negro homemakers. Daily and 
weekly cleaning took more of the time of 
the white cooperator. The majority of 
white women either hired a woman to 
assist in laundry work or sent clothing 
and household textiles away from home 
to be laundered. White homemakers in 
families of $20.00 and under housing 
spent more time in care of members than 
they did in any "other homemaking ac- 
tivity." This was because more home- 
makers in this group had children of 5 
years and under. Homemakers with

children 5 years and under averaged about 
12 hours a week in care of these chil- 
dren. 

Fifty-three percent of the Negro home- 
makers and 29 percent of the white home- 
makers spent some time in gainful ac- 
tivities during the study week. Thirty- 
four percent of the Negro homemakers 
and 21.5 percent of the white homemak- 
ers spent more than 8 hours in such ac- 
tivities. White and Negro homemakers 
with more than 8 hours gainful work av- 
eraged less time in homemaking activi- 
ties than those without gainful work. 
This difference in time was not made up 
by extra assistance in homemaking ac- 
tivities. Some of the difference in time 
expenditures of the gainful and non-gain- 
ful worker groups can be accounted for 
by a difference in composition of the 
family, women with young children less 
often having gainful work. 

The gainful-worker-homemaker group 
contained about twice as many families 
with children 6 to 15 years only than 
did the non-gainful-worker-homemaker 
group. 

A tabulation of time of starting two 
common household tasks — preparing din- 
ner and clearing house — showed that the 
majority of homemakers did not have a 
set time for starting such tasks. This 
was especially true of homemakers in 
families of lower housing value. 

Average number of hours of assistance 
in homemaking received by white wom- 
en in the $20.00 and under group was 
18.2; by white women in the $20.01 to 
$40.00 housing group, 17.2; by Negro 
women in the $7.50 and under housing 
group, 12.8; and by Negro women in the 
$7.51 to $20.00 housing group, 11.2. 

Children were the main source of as- 
sistance in homemaking activities to 
Negro women, while liired help was 
more important to white women, espec- 
ially in families with housing of $20.01 
to $40.00. Husbands in both white and 
Negro families of lower housing value 



averaged about twice as much assistance 
in homemaking activities as those in fam- 
ilies of higher housing value. Home- 
makers of larger families received con- 
siderably more assistance in homemaking 
than homemakers in small families. 
Homemakers in white families of adults 
only were more likely to receive assist- 
ance in homemaking activities than 
homemakers in Negro families of adults 
only. Negro homemakers with children 
were more likely to receive assistance. 
However, more white homemakers with 
children received a large amount of as- 
sistance than in the case of Negro home- 
makers. 

Average number of hours spent per 
week on all homemaking activities by 
all workers per family was, for white 
families in the $20.00 and under housing 
group, 69; for white families in the 
$20.01 to $40.00 housing group, 63; and 
for Negro families in both housing 
groups, 60 hours. If the work week is 
regarded as 40 hours, then homemaking 
in these households claimed the full time 
of one worker and half time of another. 

Time expenditures on meal preparation 
and clearing away were relatively more 
important in white families of $20.01 to 
$40.00 housing value, while care of house 
was relatively more important in Negro 
families of $7.50 and under housing. One 
of the factors in relatively high time ex- 
penditures in care of house of the low 
housing value Negro group was poor wat- 
er facilities. 

Homemaking time patterns of these 
Mississippi families were similar to home- 
making time patterns of families in sim- 
ilar areas in two other studies made 
about 15 years ago. 

Homemaking was more than a full- 
time job in the typical family of this 
study. Thirty percent of the white home- 
makers and 23 percent of the Negro 
homemakers averaged more than 56 hours 
during the study week, or the equivalent 
of 8 hours a day every day in the week

in such activities. Time expended in 
homemaking must be reduced not only 
for those who are overburdened, but re- 
duced so that women in famiHes of low 
socioeconomic status can take some time 
for gainful work. It must be reduced 
so that more time can be devoted to chil- 
dren, especially to older children. Among 
possibilities for reducing homemaking 
time expenditures are: 

1. More efficient methods of doing 
tasks, especially tasks that consume so 
much time, such as preparation and clear- 
ing away meals, house cleaning, launder- 
ing. This means finding the most eco- 
nomical way of performing the tasks, 
such as eliminating unnecessary steps (a) 
by planning ahead, (b) by placing equip- 
ment and materials in a better place, (c) 
by using both hands in performing tasks, 
and (d) by using time-saving equipment. 

2. An examination of one's work 
schedule. 

3. Increased use of agencies outside 
the home, such as the bakery, the com- 
mercial laundry, the day nursery. Com- 
munity and neighborhood clubs have 
a responsibility in sponsoring such facil- 
ities. 

4. More effective use of the time of 
other members of the household. 

Planning Use of Time 

The study of time expenditures in 
homemaking of other families can serve 
only one purpose, that of stimulating 
thought about one's own homemaking 
time problems. Use of time is an individ- 
ual problem, not something that can be 
borrowed from another. But how others 
use time can be of value as a check-up 
on one's own practices. 



We might at this point illustrate how 
time expenditures of others might be 
used in checking one's own expenditures. 
My family is, for example, a white fam- 
ily in the $20.01 to $40.00 housing value 
group. I would, therefore, study tables 
1, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 14. I find, for instance, 
that homemakers in this housing group 
averaged a little over 21 hours per week 
in preparing and clearing away meals; 
that they had 6.5 hours assistance in these 
activities. I would ask myself: "Is this 
less time than our family spends?" (If 
I do not know about the time spent by 
my family in preparation and clearing 
away meals, I will find out by keeping a 
record.) "If it is less time, why.? Is 
our equipment poor? Are we using in- 
efficient methods? Are several compli- 
cated dishes often served? Are few ready- 
prepared or partly prepared foods used? 
Are food activities and other household 
tasks combined? Does time of doing 
task make for time saying?" 

"If families of this study are spending 
more time in food preparation and clear- 
ing away than mine, is it because we are 
using a number of ready-prepared or 
partly prepared foods; serving a limited 
variety? Is it because we have low stan- 
dards? (Maybe we are not rinsing the 
dishes.)" 

Such an analysis as this will help home- 
makers, see what their real time prob- 
lems are, or at least give assurance that 
the family is getting what they want from 
the use of time. Planning use of time is 
most important. Every homemaker has 
the same amount of time — 24 hours a 
day. There are no time-rich, or time- 
poor homemakers. It is up to each to 
make her time worthwhile — to make it 
rich time.

Silage production and utilization has 
long been considered an important, per- 
haps an essential, practice in successful 
livestock production. 

It is believed that silos date back to the 
days of ancient Thrace, Carthage, Spain, 
and Rome, use being made of pits dug 
as deep as 12 feet and lined with 
brick, stone, or wood. The modern meth- 
od of preserving green crops by storage 
above ground in stone structures known 
as silos was widely publicized in Germ- 
any and France, beginning probably not 
long after the middle of the nineteenth 
century; and the first silo of which there 
is official record in this country was con- 
structed in Maryland in 1876. 

The first silos were of stone, but be- 
cause of lesser spoilage and lower cost, 
stone construction soon gave way to brick 
and concrete. In turn, Wood construc- 
tion soon came into common use, espe- 
cially in areas where lumber was cheap. 
During comparatively recent years, tem- 
porary or still more inexpensive methods 
of storage have been devised, including 
"silos" which are little more than wooden 
boxes of appropriate size, silos of snow 
fence and waterproofed paper construc- 
tion, and the trench silos of increasing 
popularity in the South. 

Ensilage materials have undergone a 
comparable process of evolution. Al- 
though a variety of crops was ensiled 
from the beginning in European coun- 
tries where corn is not commonly grown, 
corn was the prmciple ensilage crop until 
about the turn of the century in this coun- 
try, and still is in the high-yielding corn 
producing states. In the South, however, 
it was early learned that a much greater 
tonnage could be secured from a given 



area of sorghum than from corn, and in 
Mississippi practically all the silage pro- 
duced during recent years has been from 
sorghum. 

The silage making process is not limit- 
ed to a few crops only, but is applicable 
to a wide variety of crops. Although 
scientific knowledge is still incomplete, it 
is believed that any forage plant can be 
preserved by ensilage, provided the per- 
centages of moisture and sugar or starch 
are maintained within reasonable bounds. 
These desirable percentages occur natur- 
ally in corn and sorghum of proper ma- 
turity, which perhaps accounts for the 
nearly universal use of these crops until 
comparatively recent years. 

More recently, it has been shown by 
agricultural experiment stations in many 
states that a wide variety of crops can 
be ensiled satisfactorily by simple and 
inexpensive processes. Thus, moisture 
content is regulated to the desired level 
by stage of cutting or by a period of 
wilting; and necessary starches and sug- 
ars, when deficient, may be supplied by 
the addition of blackstrap molasses, phos- 
phoric acid, or other substances. At 
present, by careful observance of recom- 
mended procedure, satisfactory silage is 
prepared from numerous crops. 

The most recent addition to the field 
of silage knowledge concerns the content 
of carotene. Carotene is most abundant 
in green and growing plants (as well as 
in the yellow substances such as yellow 
corn, certain sweetpotatoes, yellow fats, 
egg yolk, etc.). The first problem of the 
silage maker is to harvest his crops when 
carotene is most abundant, provided a 
too-great sacrifice in yield is not thereby 
entailed; and the second problem is to 



4 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 425 



preserve the carotene harvested until the 
ensiled crop is fed. 

During a long period of years the Mis- 
sissippi Agricultural Experiment Station 
has conducted experiments in the produc- 
tion, processing, and feeding of silage. 
More lately the research work has con- 
cerned the newer phases, including the 
wide variety of crops suitable for en- 
siling, treatments necessary, plant-growth 
stage of cutting, content of carotene, mix- 
tures of legume and non-legume crops, 
and the building up of protein content 
by the addition of urea to the silage or 
the feeding of urea with silage. 

This bulletin summarizes and unifies 
work done by several departments and in- 
dividual staff members of the experiment 
station, in an effort to acquaint Missis- 
sippi farmers with the new knowledge of 
silage making, as well as to recall for 
practical use certain basic principles of 
silage production and feeding to beef 
and dairy animals. 

SILAGE CROPS AND 
SILAGE MAKING 

Silage is finely chopped, moist or green 
forage that has been stored and in which 
a certain ymount of fermentation has 
taken place in the absence of free air. 
Silage-making enables the saving of feed 
that would not be eaten in the dry state, 
as well as feed that would be lost by 
rain, and preserves 30 percent to 35 per- 
cent more of the feeding value of the 
crop by avoiding weathering losses. Sil- 
age is extremely palatable, relished by all 
classes of cattle and, being succulent, is 
essentially a substitute for pasture in win- 
ter and may be fed in the late summer 
months when pastures are low. Silage 
requires less storage room than the same 
amount of feed in the torm of hay or 
other dry forage. Its removal from the 
field clears the ground completely for 
another crop. The storage of a crop as 
silage rather than as hay eliminates the 
hazard of fire. 

Silage and silage making also has its 



disadvantages, the chief one being the in- 
itial cost for buildings, equipment, and 
power. It also concentrates the labor for 
harvesting and preserving into a few days. 

The preservation of feed by ensiling 
is by no means a new process and it is 
possible to make good silage from any 
crop that can be fed green. The making 
of silage from various forage crops may 
be new to many Mississippi farmers, 
and it is well to consider that the mak- 
ing of silage from such crops can hardly 
be considered as an emergency measure 
altogether. In the broadest sense, it is 
not practical to make hay while the sun 
shines and silage while it rains. The crop 
should be planned for the silo. 

Any green forage crop can be made 
into silage that will keep in good condi- 
tion without an excessive loss of food 
nutrients. As a rule, if the forage is pala- 
table and nutritious when it is put into 
the silo, it will be palatable and nutritious 
when it is taken out; and if it is poor 
feed when put into the silo, it will be 
poor feed when taken out. 

Although it is possible to make silage 
from almost any crop that can be fed 
green, sweet sorghums are by far the 
predominant crop grown for silage in 
Mississippi, and Honey is the most pop- 
ular variety of this crop. 

Changes Brought About In Silage 

The silaging process is quite like that 
of the heating in hay, sweating in grain, 
and similar changes. When the green, 
chopped material is first placed in the 
silo the '^^^mperature rises rather quickly 
to 80 to 90 degrees F. This rise of tem- 
perature is proportional to the amount of 
air present. Coarse chopping and in- 
adequate packing favor high tempera- 
tures, and excessive temperatures of the 
silage mean too much air. The continua- 
tion of high temperature after a week in- 
dicates that air is entering from the top 
or sides of the silo. The high tempera- 
ture is evidence of a high rate of oxida- 
tion, and if continued, increases the rate 
of loss in feed value of the silage. 



PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF SILAGE IN MISSISSIPPI 



5 



In a test to determine the effect of 
fertilization upon the yield and chemical 
composition of sorghum silage, the Agron- 
omy and Chemistry Departments of the 
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion have collected data which show some 
of the principal changes taking place in 
the making of silage. Honey sorghum 
was harvested in the hard dough stage, 
cut with a hand-operated silage cutter 
into pieces one-fourth to one-half inch 
in length, and placed into quart fruit jars 
and packed with hammer handles. This 
material and juice from this material was 
analyzed periodically thereafter for 30 
days to determine some of the chemical 
changes taking place. 

The analyses of the total sugars for 
different dates after cutting are shown in 
table 1. The results of both are report- 
ed as milligrams in 100 cubic centimeters 
of juice. 

These data show that durmg the first 
few days after packing in jars the total 
sugar decreases in amount very rapidly 
and a minimum is reached in 15 to 21 
days. From this stage on, the presence 
of air will not allow the proper preserva- 
tion of the silage, because in jars that 
were not properly packed the air permit- 
ted the development of molds. 

A large part of the loss in the total 
Table 1. Effect of 



sugars can be accredited to the forma- 
tion of acids, chiefly lactic acid which is 
the acid found in sour milk. The an- 
alyses of the lactic acid for different dates 
after cutting are given in table 2 as milli- 
grams in 100 cubic centimeters of juice. 

These data show the rapid develop- 
ment of lactic acid within 3 days after 
the sorghum was placed in the jars un- 
til a maximum was reached within 15 
to 21 days. These two tables show clear- 
ly that as the amount of total sugars de- 
creases the -imount of lactic acid increases. 
The development of this acid results in 
the preservation of the silage, for in the 
presence of this acid fermentation is im- 
possible and the bacteria which causes de- 
cay cannot live. If air should enter, then 
molds would develop, the acidity would 
be counteracted, and bacteria which cause 
putrefaction would thrive. This explains 
why there is decayed silage on top of 
the silo. The development of lactic and 
acetic acid causes the silage to change 
color, develop an aromatic odor, and gives 
it a sour taste. The degree of acidity is 
a good check on preservation; good silage 
has a pH of 4.0 or thereabouts. 

Stage of Cutting Sorghum 

In spite of its high tonnage yield per 
acre, one of the greatest and costliest dis- 



advantages associated with the growing of 

fertilizer on yield and chemical composition of sorghum silage, recorded at 
intervals after cutting.

sorghum for silage is its tendency to lodge 
as the crop approaches maturity. Espe- 
cially is this true on the more fertile soils 
and where relatively high rates of nitrog- 
enous fertilizers have been applied. Lodg- 
cases it is more economical to utilize a 
low-growing but lesser-yielding variety 
ing necessitates the use of considerable 
amounts of hand labor to harvest the 
sorghum from the field and get it to the 
silo for cutting and filling. In many 
which can be harvested with machinery, 
than a more vigorous high-yielding va- 
riety giving a greater per acre tonnage 
which must be harvested by hand labor. 

Except in the event of heavy rains and 
winds, the tall-growing sweet sorghums 
do not begin to lodge badly until after 
the dough stage of growth has been reach- 
ed. To determine whether the quality 
of silage would be greatly affected by 
stage of growth at time of harvest, and 
to determine whether sweet sorghum 
could be harvested before lodging and 
yet make good silage, the Agronomy and 
Chemistry Departments harvested and 
siloed Iceberg sorghum at various stages 
of growth. The analyses of the silage 
made from sorghum at the various stages 
of growth are given in table 3. 

From this table it may readily be seen 
that good silage can be made from sweet 
sorghum when harvested in the soft- 
dough stage. More especially is this true 
when the content of starch and sugar is 
considered. The carbohydrate content at 



maturity is only 2 percent more than at 
soft-dough, whereas there is slightly more 
undesirable crude fiber at the mature 
stage. The great difference in starch and 
sugar content between the mild and soft 
dough stages would strongly indicate that 
sorghum should not be cut for silage be- 
fore the soft-dough stage. 

Silage From Crops Other Than 
Sorghum and Corn 

Legumes 

Several section;, of the State produce 
considerable amounts of alfalfa and oth- 
er legumes for hay. In many seasons in 
Mississippi the weather is very likely to 
be troublesome during the time of the 
first cutting for hay, and plans to put part 
or all of this cutting in the silo may pro- 
vide a practical and a satisfactory alter- 
native. 

It might be well to point out that 
many experiment stations have found 
that there is no marked or special su- 
periority of legume silage over the hay in 
feeding value, provided the hay is har- 
vested at the proper stage of maturity 
and cured to retain most of its leaves and 
color. The labor necessary for making si- 
lage is greater than that required for 
making hay. It is questionable that si- 
lage should be made of alfalfa or other 
legumes under conditions favorable for 
the making of highest quality hay. It 
is much more difficult to make good si- 
lage out of a protein-rcih crop, such as 
alfalfa, than it is from corn or sorghum.

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF SILAGE IN MISSISSIPPI

Alfalfa and other legumes should be 
cut for silage at a slightly less mature 
stage of growth than they are usually cut 
for hay: alfalfa when about in 1/lOth 
bloom, and soybeans at the early pod 
stage. 

The high protein and calcium content 
and low sugar content of legumes favor 
the development of undesirable types of 
bacteria, and special precautions must be 
taken to insure the proper preservation. 
It is almost necessary to add some type 
of preservative to a legume to aid in pro- 
ducing more fermentation or to provide 
acids directly. Molasses, phosphoric acid, 
or mixtures with sorghum or corn are 
the most common preservatives used. 
Molasses is usually preferred because of 
not being harmful and because the addi- 
tion of molasses usually improves the 
palatability of the silage. Partial drying 
is advantageous in the case of spring 
clovers; the moisture content of forage 
crops when being put into the silo should 
be from 50 to 70 percent moisture. 

To determine conditions favorable for 
the making of good silage out of various 
forage croos the Agronomy and Chem- 
istry Departments have conducted tests 
over several years with various crops. 
Results from these tests are shown in 
following paragraphs. 

Persian Clover 

Persian clover is especially adapted to 



moist and fertile bottomlands where it 
can be efficiently utilized for grazing 
or hay. Some planters have experienced 
years in which they have had an over- 
abundance of this clover and at the same 
time have had weather which would not 
permit the making of high quality hay. 
The Agronomy and Chemistry Depart- 
ments made trials on this plant mater- 
ial to see if silage could be made of it. 
These trials may be summarized by giv- 
ing the conditions necessary for silage 
making. The material should be wilted 
so that it contains at least 25 percent dry 
matter, which at early flowering stage 
requires from 2 hours to 4 hours wilting 
in the swath. This material can then be 
ensiled, provided that at least 18 pounds 
of 75 percent phosphoric acid or 70 
pounds of blackstrap molasses per ton are 
added. Such material, ensiled with these 
minimum requirements, gave satisfactory 
silage, while the untreated material spoil- 
ed (table 4). 

Vetch 

Vetch is widely used as a soil-improv- 
ing crop and is sometimes utilized as a 
hay or for temporary grazing. To de- 
termine processes necessary to its utiliza- 
tion as a silage crop, hairy vetch con- 
taining 85 percent moisture was harvested 
with a mowing machine, cut to !4 to Vz" 
inch lengths with a hand cutter, treated 
in various ways, and compacted and seal-

ed in quart fruit jars. The analyses of 
the variously treated plant material at 
different moisture contents are given in 
table 5. 

All the silages in this group were of 
extremely bad quality with very bad odor. 
Vetch at this moisture content without 
treatment failed to mak^; silage. These 
data clearly show that the moisture con- 
tent was too high to produce quality si- 
lage with the amounts of preservatives 
used. 

This table shows that wilting vetch 
from its natural moisture content of 85 
percent to a 69 percent moisture content 
enabled the production of silage. This 
silage was only fair in quality, except 
those lots receiving 21 pounds of 75 per- 
cent phosphoric acid per ton or 90 pounds 
of blackstrap molasses per ton. It is 
strongly recommended to those contem- 
plating the making of silage from vetch, 
that the mowed material be thoroughly 
wilted before being sent through the en- 
silage cutter, and that rather large 
amounts of preservatives be added. 



Soybeans 

Soybeans were found to be similar to 
Persian clover and vetch in ensilage re- 
quirements, in that the crop should be 
wilted and some preservative used to in- 
sure fermentation. Soybeans as cut, with 
76 percent moisture, ensiled with the 
same treatments as given above for vetch, 
reacted in the same unsatisfactory man- 
ner. Most samples gave pH values high- 
er than 4.8 and possessed a foul odor. 
Those samples wilted in the field so as 
to contain less than 69 percent moisture 
(31 percent dry matter) made silage of 
a fair to excellent quality. Soybean si- 
lage on a dry basis was found to be rela- 
tively high in calcium (0.66 to 1.51 per- 
cent), phosphorus (0.54 to 1.48 percent), 
and protein (16 to 26.5 percent). 

Because of the high content of calcium, 
phosphorus, and crude protein in legumes 
such as soybeans, it was deemed advis- 
able to prepare silages containing varying 
proportions of soybeans and sorghums, 
>vith and without the addition of preser- 
vatives. Green material consisting of 54?

Vz, and /4 parts soybeans and sorghum 
were prepared. The analyses of 'the si- 
lages prepared from these mixtures are 
contained in table 7, and are on a dry 
basis. 

These data, like those with soybeans, 
of soybeans is increased, so is the calcium, 
phosphorus, and crude protein content in- 
rreased. They also show that as the 
amount of phosphoric acid added per ton 
is increased, so is the phosphorus con- 
tent of the silage increased. Sorghum in 
the proportion of one-fourth of the weight 
of material going into the silo furnished 
enough fermentable sugars to result in 
the production of good silage. The addi- 
tion of molasses did not increase the 
phosphorus content but did slightly raise 
the calcium content. Analyses of the soy- 
beans (69.42 percent moisture) used in 
these mixtures show that in all cases the 
protein content of the soybeans dropped 
after ensiling. The composition of the 
soybeans used was 69.42 percent moisture, 
1.78 percent calcium, 0.34 percent phos- 
phorus, and 16.40 percent protein. As 
the percentage of soybeans was increased 
in the mixture, likewise was the percent- 
age of the constituents analyzed increased 



regardless of the treatment and kind and 
amount of preservative used. 

Alfalfa 

In many years the conditions for curing 
the first cutting of alfalfa are unfavorable 
on account of excessive rainfall or moist 
weather, and considerable amounts are 
lost that possibly could ht saved by put- 
ting into the silo. Attempts to ensile 
freshly cut alfalfa, usuali) with a mois- 
ture content of approximately 75 percent, 
have given about as many failures as suc- 
cesses even with the use of relatively large 
amounts of preservatives. This leads to 
the recommendation that alfalfa be mow- 
ed and allowed to wilt 2 to 4 hours in 
the swath before putting into the silo. 
In tests to determine the moisture con- 
tent at which this material may be suc- 
cessfully ensiled, alfalfa containing 75.37 
percent moisture was ensiled as cut, and 
was ensiled at various percentages of mois- 
ture with and .vithout preservatives. The 
results are given in table 8. 

These data show that as the proportion 
show that the addition of phosphoric acid 
increased the phosphorus content of the 
silage. The silage made from the alfalfa 
containing 74.63 percent moisture was of

only a fair quality and had a rather bad 
odor while that from alfalfa with a low- 
er moisture content made silage which 
was good quality and with a pleasant 
odor. 

Crotalaria Intermedia 

Crotalaria intermedia, the species of 
crotalaria used for forage, was cut and 
ensiled with varying amounts of 75 per- 
cent phosphoric acid. The plant mater- 
ial cut at the early flowering stage con- 
tained 72 percent moisture, and on a dry 
weight basis contained 0.88 percent cal- 
cium, 0.28 percent phosphorus, and 20.94 
percent crude protein. The analyses of 
the silage prepared with the different 
amounts of acid are contained in table 9. 

These data bear out the same results 
as shown with the other legumes and 
justify the same conclusions that some 
preservative is needed for the making of 
silage. To make good quality silage of 
crotalaria intermedia, it appears to re- 
quire 18 or more pounds of acid per ton. 
Amounts less than this permitted the 
making of silage, but it was of poor 
quality. The material to which no pre- 
servative was added spoiled and was full 
of mold. Like the other legumes, the phos- 
phorus content of the crotalaria silage in- 
creased as the amount per ton of acid 
was added. 

Sweetpotatoes and Sweetpotato 
Vines 

Although the sweetpotato is grown 
largely for human food, a portion of each 
crop fails to meet market requirements 
and there are times when attractive prices 
cannot be obtained. A review of feeding 
experiments, conducted by this and oth- 
er experiment stations, will show that 
when used in combination with other 
feeds sweetpotatoes make a very satis- 
factory and efficient supplement ration. 
One-hundred pounds of sweetpotato si- 
lage has been found by the Florida Ex- 
periment Station (Press Bulletin 274) to 
be equal to 150 to 200 pounds of corn 
silage in the ration for dairy cows. 



Several Stations have received marked 
increases in milk flow from dairy cows as 
a result of grazing sweetpotato vines. Oth- 
er tests show that the removal of vines 
before maturity reduces the yield of pota- 
toes, the reduction depending upon the 
amount removed and the time of remov- 
al. Investigations by this Station (Miss. 
Tech. Bull. 27) have shown that it is 
difficult to make hay of sweetpotato 
vines. This is due to the high moisture 
(80-86 percent) content of the vines. That 
these vines can be saved and utilized as 
a succulent feed is shown by the results 
obtained from tests on crops used for si- 
lage and on methods of silage making 
that have been conducted at this Station. 

The Mameyita and Triumph varieties 
were grown on Trinity clay loam and 
were fertilized with 600 pounds of a 
6-8-4 analysis fertilizer. Vines were har- 
vested by cutting at the surface of the 
soil, then raking. Samples were saved for 
the purpose of determining the moisture 
content and the percentage of stems and 
leaves. As raked, the vines were run 
through an ensilage cutter. Cut material 
of the Hodo variety of sorghum was en- 
siled with the same treatments for com- 
parison. The cut material of both was 
then treated with various amounts of 
75 percent phosphoric acid and blackstrap 
molasses. Quart fruit jars were packed 
with this material and tightly sealed. 

These varieties produced relatively large 
amounts of vines per acre. Mameyita 
produced 24,055 pounds of green weight 
per acre and Triumph produced 23,087 
pounds, which is a production of 12 and 
11^2 tons, respectively, of silage mater- 
ial per acre. Well over three-fourths or 
83.67 percent of this material produced 
was plant water. Even with this high 
moisture content the Mameyita produced 
3,981 pounds of dry material per acre, 
followed by Triumph with 3,821 pounds 
per acre. Nearly one-third or 29.49 per- 
cent of ♦ihis yield! consisted of leaves, 
while the stems accounted for 70.51 per- 
cent of the yield.

*Analyses on dry basis 



Five monihs after placing the harvested 
and variously treated plant material into 
jars, the jars were opened and the silage 
analyzed for calcium, phosphorus, crude 
protein, and sugar. These results are 
contained in table 10. 

It will he noted from this data that 
it is difficult to ensile sweetpotato vines 
directly after harvest (with 83.67 percent 
moisture) without the addition of some 
preservative. Of the 12 samples placed 
in jars at a moisture content of 83.67 per- 
cent without using some preservative, all 
spoiled. This spoilage was partial decay 
and the presence of mold. 

Significant is the fact that despite a 
high moisture content, the addition of 
relatively small amounts of phosphoric 
acid or blackstrap molasses results in good 
silage with a pleasant aroma. When a 
larger amoimt of the material (18 tons) 
was put Into temporary silo, using 18 
pounds of phosphoric acid per ton, it was 
eaten readily by dairy cattle, poultry, and 
hogs. 



It will he noted that with increased 

amounts of phosphoric acid the phospho- 
rus content of both sweetpotato vine and 
sorghum silage also increases. Increased 
amounts molasses aflected the phos- 
phorus content of both silages only slight- 

The calcium content of the sweetpotato 
vine silage was outstandingly higher than 
that of the sorghum silage. With the 
exception of one treatment, the calcium 
content of the sweetpotato vine silage was 
four times that of sorghum, and in this 
one exception it was a little more than 
three times the amount. 

The sugar content of the silages shows 
the widest difference. The sorghum si- 
lage with no treatment contained more 
sugar than the highest of the treated 
sweetpotato vine silage. These data show 
that with a crop such as sweetpotato vines, 
having small amounts of sugar, enough 
cf the desirable acids for preservation can- 
not be formed without supplement; and 
lacking the necessary acids, the bacteria

causing decay are allowed to work, result- 
ing in a mass of partially decayed plant 
material. To produce silage with such a 
crop some preservative must be added. 
These data also clearly show that where 
preservatives were added the desirable 
acids were formed, with the results that 
much of the plant sugar (carbohydrates) 
was saved. Even with a sweet sorghum 
material the addition of preservatives re- 
sulted in a saving of two or three times 
the amount of sugar as compared to sor- 
ghum silage in which the preserving acids 
were formed from the plant sugars. 

An outstanding characteristic of sweet- 
potato vine silage as compared with the 
hay made from the same plant, is the su- 
perior carotene content of the silage. The 
carotene contents of the sweetpotato vine 
silages reported above are shown in table 
12.

These dat^^ show that the preservation 
of carotene increased as the amount of 
acid added was increased up to 15 pounds 
per ton, but that increased carotene pre- 
servation due to still larger amounts of 
molasses added was at a declining rate. 
Attempts to make hay of sweetpotato 
vines have resulted in the production 
of a hay largely without leaves, very 
stemmy, and containing almost no caro- 
tene. These data show that relatively 
large proportions of the carotene in green 
sweetpotato vines is preserved in the si- 
lage. 



Notes and Discussion 

Two of the fundamentals in the mak- 
ing of silage is the presence of ferment- 
able sugars and the exclusion of air. Crops 
as sweet sorghum, corn, and grass con- 
tain enough of these sugars to produce 
the desired amounts of preserving acids. 
Legume crops, on the other hand, are 
high in calcium and protein and low in 
fermentable sugars and should have some 
preservative added. 

The data presented have shown that 
the preserving acids, especially lactic acid, 
are formed at the expense of sugars, and 
that this reaction begins almost at the 
time of ensiling. The reduction in the 
sugar and starch is the greatest loss of 
feed constituents. 

The composition of the silages made 
from sorghum harvested at various stages 
of growth clearly show that almost as 
good a quality silage can be made from 
sorghums harvested somewhat earlier than 
now practiced, which amounts to 2 or 3 
weeks. This earlier harvesting, in many 
cases, would enable harvesting with a 
binder and eliminate much hand labor. 
Silage made from sorghums harvested 
earlier than the soft-dough stage, based on 
these data, would have much less car- 
bohydrates than that made from sorghum 
harvested a week later. The younger the 
plant the more water it contains and re- 
sults in silage with m.ore acid. 

Attempts to ensile legumes with a 
moisture content higher than 70 percent, 
even with relatively large amounts of 
preservatives, have given erratic results. 
As many failures were experienced as 
successes, and when silage was made it 
had a very questionable odor. When le- 
gumes were wilted to an extent that the 
moisture content was lower than 70 per- 
cent, preferably 60 percent, good silage 
was produced by adding preservatives. 

The data presented indicate that le- 
gume crops should be wilted 2 to 4 hours 
in the swath and ensiled with at least 
18 pounds of at least 50 percent phos- 
phoric acid or 50 to 70 pounds of mo-

lasses. It should be kept in mind that 
in making silage of legume crops it is 
necessary to handle 3 to 4 times as much 
weight as when the same is made into 
hay. Also that there is no advantage in 
the feeding of legume silage over the 
same crop as hay, provided top quality 
hay can be made of the crop. 

In putting chopped green material into 
the silo it should be: 

1. Put into a silo that affords good 
drainage. 

2. Chopped rather fine, approximately 
'/2-inch. 

3. Packed as tightly as possible, and 
uniformly. 

4. In the case of legumes, allowed to 
wilt in the swath and use some preserva- 
tive. 

5. Rounded ofT on top with the heaviest 
chopped green material available. 

Utilization of Johnson Grass 
As Silage 

Johnson grass is abundant in some sec- 
tions of Mississippi. While this crop is 
usually cut for hay, weather conditions 
are sometimes such as to make hay pro- 
duction difJicult. Under these conditions 
Johnson grass might be put up as silage. 
With this in mind it was decided to 
carry out some tests on the best manner 
of ensiling Johnson grass, from both 
chemical and feeding standpoints. The 
silage was fed to dairy cows, and records 
were kept on milk production and the 
gain or loss in weight of the animals. In 
both the chemical and feeding tests, John- 
son grass silage was compared with sor- 
ghum silage. 

Johnson grass was ensiled in Sisalkraft 
silos in the fall of 1941, at two stages 
of maturity, and fed to dairy cattle dur- 
ing the winter months. Table 13 shows 
the chemical analysis of the Johnson grass 
before and after being made into silage 
and the composition of the sorghum si- 
lage. Practically all of the sugar and 
starch in the Johnson grass silage dis- 
appeared after being made into silage. 



The sorghum silage still contained con- 
siderable sugar and starch when fed. 
About half of the carotene was lost from 
the Johnson grass during the process of 
ensiling. The immature Johnson grass 
silage contained over twice as much caro- 
tene as did the mature Johnson grass si- 
lage. The mature Johnson grass silage 
contained about the same quantity of 
carotene as did the sorghum silage. 

Feeding tests indicated that the imma- 
ture Johnson grass silage was equal to 
sorghum silage, both in milk production 
and in maintaining the weight of the 
dairy cows, but that the mature Johnson 
grass silage was inferior to sorghum si- 
lage. Calcium and phosphorus were high- 
er in the immature Johnson grass silage 
than in the sorghum silage. The mature 
Johnson grass silage contained more cal- 
cium than the sorghum silage, but the 
phosphorus Vv^as about the same. 

The degree to which the blackstrap mo- 
lasses contributed to the composition was 
not determined, but the data collected 
in 1943 (table 15) suggest that the black- 
strap molasses did not contribute appreci- 
ably to the composition, except in sugar. 

In 1942, Johnson grass silage was put 
up in what might be called a good hay 
stage, or slightly more advanced than the 
"immature" silage for 1941. Again the 
silage was placed in temporary wire 
Sisalkraft silos of about the same sizes 
as were used the previous year. The fol- 
lowing treatments were studied: (1) Cut 
with a silage cutter, (2) crushed with 
a hay crusher in the field, and (3) neither 
cut nor crushed (mowed only). Black- 
strap molasses was added at the rate of 
60 pounds per ton of grass. 

According to the feeding tests, the si- 
lage cut with the silage cutter was equal 
to sorghum silage, while the crushed 
Johnson grass silage was inferior to sor- 
ghum silage. The uncrushed and uncut 
silage completely spoiled. The weights 
per cubic foot of the unsettled silage 
were: (1) Cut with silage cutter, 26.7 
pounds; (2) crushed, 19 pounds; and (3)

mowed only, 15.1 pounds. Evidently the 
unsettled weight for good Johnson grass 
silage should be more than 19 pounds per 
cubic foot. Table 14 shows the chemical 
composition of the Johnson grass and sor- 
ghum silages for the 1942 season. 

The chemical analysis shows that both 
the sorghum and Johnson grass lost con- 
siderable sugar and starch when made in- 
to silage. Again carotene, calcium, and 
phosphorus were higher in the Johnson 
grass than in the sorghum silage. 

In 1943, it was decided to test the pre- 
servation of Johnson grass in small trench 
silos, rather than in Sisalkraft silos as 
used the previous 2 years. These silos 
were built on the side of a fairly steep 
slope. The pits were about 25 feet long 
and 6 feet deep at the upper ends. The 
following treatments were used: (1) cut 
with silage cutter and no blackstrap mo- 
lasses added, (2) cut with silage cutter 
with blackstrap molasses added at rate of 
60 pounds per ton of grass, and (3) not 
cut (mowed only) and no molasses added. 

The silage cut with the silage cutter, 
whether blackstrap molasses was added 
or not, kept about the same and both 
seemed about equal to sorghum silage in 
feeding value. The uncut Johnson grass 
was largely spoiled, although small pock- 
ets of fair silage were present. The chem- 
ical data for the 1943 study were, in 
general, similiar to those already present- 
ed (table 15). 

Many laboratory tests were conducted 
in order to determine the effect of pre- 
servatives on the keeping of Johnson grass 
silage. These tests indicated no preserva- 
tive was necessary, although the preserva- 
tives did have some influence on the pH 
(acidity) of the silage (table 16). Neith- 
er blackstrap molasses nor phosphoric acid 
had any marked influence on the caro- 
tene content of the silage, although large 
quantities of blackstrap molasses tended 
to lower it somewhat. The lowering of 
the carotene content due to large rates of 
application of blackstrap molasses can be 



ascribed to its diluting the carotene that 
was initially present in the Johnson grass. 

UTILIZATION OF SILAGE 
BY BEEF CATTLE 

Silage has been used as the principal 
roughage for wintering mature cows and 
growing cattle since the beginning of the 
beef cattle program at State College more 
than 40 years ago. Silage has also been 
extensively used in finishing rations for 
mature steers and younger cattle. 

Experimental results have consistently 
shown that silage fed ad libitum plus 
6 to 8 pounds of cottonseed meal and 3 
pounds of grass hay, constitutes one of 
the most economical rations for finishing 
mature plain steers, such as are usually 
fed out in Mississippi. Experimental re- 
sults indicate also that when beef cattle 
are wintered primarily on harvested 
roughages, silage will be rated toward the 
top of the list, economy considered. 

Comparison of Silage Crops 

In the earlier years of the State College 
beef cattle program, silage was produced 
primarily from corn notwithstanding the 
fact that experimental work was carried 
on with other crops like sunflowers, the 
sorghums, and even cotton stalks. In 
1926, the Animal Husbandry Department 
began a series of experiments with three 
of the then leading silage crops in order 
to study comparative yields and feeding 
values. Sagrain, Goliad corn, and Honey 
sorghum (commonly called Texas Seed- 
ed Ribbon Cane) were planted in the 
same field, 10 rows being planted in sa- 
grain, 10 in corn, and 10 in sorghum, and 
this method of planting continued for the 
entire width of the field. The average 
annual yields per acre for the three years 
were: corn 8.07 tons, sorghum 19.6 tons, 
and sagrain 10.56 tons. 

For the 3 years in which these 
crops were grown, weather conditions 
were considered to be normal and the 
yields an average of what one might ex- 
pect on reasonably good land.

The feeding value of the silage from 
the three plants was compared by full 
feeding the silage, as well as cottonseed 
hulls, along with cottonseed meal and a 
small amount of grass hay, to mature 
common steers for 120 days. 

In these experiments the relative feed- 
ing value of silage produced from the 
three crops was determined by compar- 
ison with cottonseed hulls. One hundred 
pounds of cottonseed hulls was equal in 
feeding value to 189 pounds of corn sil- 
lage, or 249 pounds of sagrain silage, or 
272 pounds of sorghum silage. 

The results of these experiments in- 
dicated that Honey sorghum, even though 
slightly lower in feeding value, was far 
superior to corn and sagrain in terms of 
total nutrients produced per acre on ac- 
count of high tonnage. Because of the 
heavy yielding characteristic and a satis- 
factory feeding value, Honey sorghum 
was selected as the principal silage crop, 
and has been used for the past 20 years 
on the Mississippi Experiment Station 
farm as a silage crop for beef cattle. 

Honey sorghum, as well as other heavy 
yielding varieties, lodges or blows down 
badly, which constitutes a very serious ob- 
jection due to the large amount of hand 
labor required and the added cost of 
harvesting. 

Silage for Wintering Beef 
Cattle 

Sorghum silage has been used as the 
principal roughage in wintering rations 



for beef cattle since its selection as the 
leading silage crop. As was true with 
finishing mature steers, beef heifers and 
mature cows have been wintered cheaper 
when the bulk of the ration was sorghum 
silage than when any other harvested 
feeds were used. For a number of years 
the Experiment Station beef herd was 
wintered on experimental rations includ- 
ing the use of most of the roughages 
commonly grown in the area. 

Included in these experiments were 
comparative studies of soybean hay, John- 
son grass hay, lespedeza hay, cottonseed 
hulls, and sorghum silage. Out of these 
studies came the State College standard 
wintering rations for beef cattle. The ra- 
tions recommended for the different ages 
of cattle are as follows: 
Mature cows: 

30 pounds sorghum silage 
5 pounds Johnson grass hay 
1 pound cottonseed meal 
Yearling heifers: 

25 pounds sorghum silage 
5 pounds Johnson grass hay 
IV2 pounds cottonseed meal 
Weanling heifers: 

15 pounds sorghum silage 
3 pounds Johnson grass hay 
IV2 pounds cottonseed meal 
Since the average length of the winter- 
ing period for this section is 100 days it 
is seen that feed requirements for each 
mature cow are 1 tons of sorghum si- 
lage, ton of rough hay, and 1 sack of 
cottonseed meal. This amount of har-

vested feed, plus good pasture, has main- 
tained the beef cattle breeding herd at 
State College over a period of years in 
thrifty condition, and under this system 
of management the herd has produced 
better than an 85 percent calf crop. 

Fortifying Sorghum Silage 
With Urea 

During recent years research workers 
at some of the experiment stations found 
that certain nitrogenous materials would 
partially take the place of protein supple- 
ments, such as cottonseed meal, soybean 
meal, and linseed meal in cattle rations. 
The material that gave most promise was 
urea, which is a granular material carry- 
ing approximately 46 percent nitrogen. 
For several years urea has been used to 
fortify grain feeds, but only by mixing 
with the grain as fed. 

Realizing that a protein supplement 
should be fed with sorghum silage for 
the best results, Mississippi Station work- 
ers conceived the idea of fortifying sor- 
ghum, silage with urea. Ten pounds of 



urea per ton were added to the silage as 
it was blown into the silo. A 50-ton silo 
was filled with the urea-treated silage, 
which was compared to untreated silage 
in rations for wintering beef cattle. Three 
years' observations on the utilization of 
urea-treated sorghum silage as compared 
to untreated sorghum silage indicates that 
the feeding value is considerably improv- 
ed. 

The results of the 1944-45 wintering 
test with urea-treated and untreated sor- 
ghum silage arc shown in table 17, which 
is shown above. 

The need of protein in the ration for 
mature cov/s is clearly shown in the first 
section of the table. Those in lot 2, fed 
untreated silage and Johnson grass hay, 
lost 99 pounds during the wintering pe- 
riod. Those supplied additional protein, 
made slight gains. Lot 3, receiving urea- 
treated silage, was as good as lot 1, which 
received untreated silage plus 1 pound of 
cottonseed meal daily. 

Work with yearling heifers, shown in 
the second section of the table, gave re- 
sults approximately similar. Those in

Silage for Finishing Steers 
For Market 

In general it can be said that Missis- 
sippi is not a beef cattle finishing State. 
This is particularily true where large 
amounts cf grain are involved in fatten- 
ing rations. It is believed, however, that 
there is an opportunity for more cattle to 
be finished to medium and good grades 
on home grown roughages plus cotton- 
seed meal or cottonseed cake and a small 
amount of hay. 

Naturally, the grades of cattle that will 
handle this type of ration most econom- 
ically are common, medium, and good 
2-year-old or older steers. Two-year-old 
or older steers will consume about 50 
pounds of silage per day for 120 days, 
along with 6 to 8 pounds of cottonseed 



meal and 3 pounds of hay. The daily 
gains for thrifty catde should range from 
1.75 to near 2 pounds. 

This type of cattle finishing program 
represents the sale of a high-yielding crop 
plus a home-grown concentrate and a 
minimum of hay through the grades of 
cattle that usually are available in the 
State. Such a practice over a period of 
years will no doubt result in improved 
soils by properlv handling the manure 
produced from the feeding operations. 

A demonstration of the performance of 
mature common steers when full fed sor- 
ghum silage and corn silage, both lots re- 
ceiving a basic ration of cottonseed meal 
and Johnson grass, is shown in table 18. 

Reference to the tabic will indicate 
that the several roughages used in the 
comparison did not vary greatly in feed- 
ing efficiency when costs and returns are 
considered. Average daily gains by lots 
were as follows: corn silage 1.95 pounds, 
cottonseed hulls 1.98 pounds, sorghum 
silage 1.87 pounds, sagrain silage 1.74 
pounds, Johnson grass hay 1.69 pounds. 

Of the three silage lots, steers receiving 
corn silage consumed 43.35 pounds per 



20 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 425 



day, those receiving sorghum silage con- 
sumed 50.96 pounds per day, while those 
receiving sagrain silage consumed 42.53 
pounds per day. There was little differ- 
ence in the selling price per hundred 
weight between the 5 lots. 

This feeding test seems to confirm that 
corn silage is slightly superior to sor- 
ghum silage on a pound-for-pound basis; 
but is confirmation also, that sorghum 
silage is a very satisfactory succulent 
roughage. The fact that sorghum yield- 
ed 19.6 tons while corn yielded only 8.07 
tons of silage per acre appears to be a 
logical explanation of the fact that sor- 
ghum has ahnost completely replaced corn 
as the principal source of silage since 
these results were published. 

UTILIZATION OF SILAGE 
BY DAIRY ANIMALS 

In the curn belt, corn silage is recogniz- 
ed as the best and most economical suc- 
culent feed that can be grown for winter 
feeding. While the value of this crop 
in Mississippi is recognized, corn yields 
are often low and uncertain on most 
farms if planted late. Sorghum, espe- 
cially the larger growing varieties, will 
be found more economical than corn be- 
cause of the much larger yields per acre. 
The yield of sorghum is often 50 to 100 
percent more than corn, and experiments 
indicate that 15 to 20 tons of sorghum to 
the acre is not an unusual yield. On the 
same land, 8 to 12 tons of corn would 
be considered a fair crop. 

Silage as a feed for dairy cows has 
many advantages, among which may be 
named: it is palatable, digestible, suc- 
culent, bulky, healthful, easily kept, and 
it is cheap. One of the chief advantages 
over hay is the fact that silage can be 
harvested under weather conditions that 
would make the saving of No. 1 hay dif- 
ficult or impossible. 

Many cops such as corn, sagrain, al- 
falfa, soybeans, and most of the grasses 
and legumes may be used for silage, but 
for most farms in Mississippi sorghum is 



recommended. Some of the reasons for 
this are: 

1. Compared with other crops, the 
yield of sorghum silage is large. 

2. When planted thick in 3^2 -foot 
rows (1/4 to 1/3 bushel seed per acre) 
and cultivated early, no hoeing is requir- 
ed. 

3. Sorghum may be planted any time 
between April 1 and June 15, thus mak- 
ing it possible to plant after winter cov- 
er crops have been removed. 

4. It may be cut for silage from the 
soft-dough stage until the seed are thor- 
oughly ripe but may stand for two or 
three weeks after this without material in- 
jury, while corn should be cut just after 
it passes the roasting ear stage and rapid- 
ly depreciated in quality after this point 
has been reached. 

5. Due to the large yield and the low 
cost of production, sorghum is one of the 
most economical feeds that may be grown 
for silage. 

6. Ton for ton, sorghum silage is not 
worth as much as corn silage. One ton 
of the latter has a feeding value equal 
to 1.11 tons of sorghum, but the yield 
of sorghum is often 1 Yi to 2 times that 
of corn. 

During the 10 years in which silage 
was grown in an experiment by the Dairy 
Department, a total of 5.95 acres was 
planted each year in sorghum for silage. 
The total yield was 208,400 pounds, or 
an average of 17.6 tons per acre per year. 

The total cost of man, horse and tractor 
labor required for making this silage was 
$118.47, or $1.13 per ton. This cost 
was distributed as follows: man labor 
$54.95 or $0,525 per ton; horse labor 
$23.20 or $0,222 per ton; tractor labor 
$40.32 or 350.385 per ton. Labor for 
growing and harvesting this crop was dis- 
tributed as follows: preparation and plant- 
ing $29.97, or $0,286 per ton; for cul- 
tivation $9.75, or $0,093 per ton; and for 
harvesting and putting in silo $78.75, or 
$0,752 per ten. Total cost per ton $1.13. 
It required 90 pounds of home-grown

seed to plant this area, valued at $1.80. 
The total cost of labor and seed was 
$120.27. 

The silage was charged to the cows at 
$3.50 per ton, or a total of $366.45. At 
this estimated value, value of the silage 
over cost of labor and seed was $246.18, 
or $41.37 per acre per year. 

Johnson Grass Silage For 
Dairy Cows 

Johnson grass was cut when immature, 
at the stage when it was just beginning 
to head out, and was put into small above- 
ground silos. Into one silo the grass was 
run through the silage cutter and into 
another the grass was crushed after mow- 
ing but not run through the silage cut- 
rer. To each lot was added 60 pounds 
of blackstrap molasses per ton of silage. 
The Johnson grass silags did not keep 
as well as sorghum silage, and that from 
crushed Johnson grass was less palatable 
than either sorghum or cut Johnson grass 
silage. The results of the two winters' 
feeding indicate that there is very little 
difference in the feeding values per ton 
of sorghum silage and cut Johnson grass 
silage. The results of the first winter's 
feeding indicate that mature Johnson 
grass is less valuable than immature, and 
in the second winter's feeding better re- 
sults were obtained from cut Johnson 
grass than from the crushed. The cut 
grass kept better and was more palatable. 

Grass Silage For Young 
Bulls 

When young bulls were fed cottonseed 
meal alone or in a mixture of cottonseed 
meal, corn and oats at the rate of 3 
pounds per day in addition to hay or pas- 
ture, the feed was not sufficient to secure 
normal growth. The inadequacy of this 
ration was particularly evident during the 
winter feeding period, when the bulls 
were on dry feed and when the hay was 
of poor quality. Both the rate of de- 
velopment and sperm production varied 
greatly with the individual animals, ir- 



respective of the concentrates fed. The 
substitution of grass silage for a portion 
of the hay resulted in a marked improve- 
ment in the animals on all the rations 
fed. The grass silage contained several 
times as much carotene as did the hay. 

Amount of Silage Needed 

The amount of silage most advantage- 
ously included in the dairy ration will de- 
pend upon several factors. The farmer 
with plenty of No. 1 hay economically 
produced can afford to provide less si- 
lage per animal than where there is a 
scarcity of such hay. It must be recogniz- 
ed however that much of the hay saved 
at present in Mississippi is inferior in 
quality and of Httle value as feed for the 
dairy cow. The amount of silage need- 
ed will al'O depend upon the kind of 
pasture provided, whether the pasture 
will furnish good grazing through the 
summer and fall months. The average 
dairy cow will need from one-half to two- 
thirds of a ton of silage per month for as 
many months as it is found necessary to 
feed silage. It is better to have too much 
than too little, for if it is not needed it 
can be kept until the following year. The 
Dairy Department of Mississippi State 
College has fed silage that was kept for 
5 years and it appeared to be as good 
as fresh silage. On this basis, to pro- 
vide silage tor 20 cows for a period of 
5 months would require 55 to 75 tons 
annually. 

Calves from 3 months old up may 
be fed limited amounts of silage with 
good results, along with hay and concen- 
trates to meet the needed food nutrients 
required for growth and development. 

Dairy heifers respond well to silage, 
hay, concentrates, salt and water during 
the winter months or seasons of short pas- 
tures. 

A small amount of good quality silage 
adds materially to the diet of breeding 
bulls, preferably 15 to 20 pounds fed 
daily along with good quality hay and 
some concentrates.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 425 



Feeding Silage 

Legume and grass silage may be fed in 
place of sorghum or corn silage or in 
place of part of the hay. Cows will con- 
sume more dry matter if fed some hay 
along with silage than if fed either alone. 

In Mississippi it is desirable to feed 
most of the silage and hay at night, as 
the cows may often do some grazing dur- 
ing the dav throughout most of the year 
if weather is favorable and provisions have 
been made for such crops. It is best to 
feed the silage after milking has been 
completed and the milk has been remov- 
ed from the barn, as this will prevent 
idors from being absorbed into the milk. 

Cows that are fed silage stay in better 
physical condition as shown by brighter 
eyes, sleeker coats of hair, and keener 
appetites than those in the same herd not 
getting silage. Some silage may be fed 
the bull, heifers, and to calves after about 
2 to 3 months old without any detri- 
mental results and it may add materially 
to their ration especially when No. 2 or 
No. 3 hay is being fed. In feeding this 
low qualitv hay it is hard to get cows 
to consume enough to supply the need- 
ed total digestible nutrients (TDN) in 
the ration, as such hay is not palatable, 
and the cows invariably refuse from 10 
to 50 percent of poor cjuality hay even 
though they are being fed in limited 
quantities. 

During the past winter 12 cows in the 
College herd, over a period of 156 days, 
refused 25.96 percent of the Johnson 
grass hay and 0.32 percent of the sor- 
ghum silage. Such refusal in the hay 
undoubtedly was reflected in the condi- 
tion of the cow and in the milk yield 



being decreased, unless additional TDN 
was supplied by more expensive concen- 
trate feed. The cows were being fed 8 
pounds of Johnson grass hay and 30 
pounds of sorghum silage per head daily, 
along with sufficient concentrates to meet 
the needs of the individual cow. 

In another experiment 10 cows that 
were fed 8 pounds of lespedeza hay and 
30 pounds of sorghum silage, refused 
11.41 percent of the hay and 1.87 percent 
of the silage during the test period. 

Cows will consume more total digest- 
ible nutrients from roughage if a greater 
proportion of it is supplied in the form 
of silage than in the usual poor quality 
hay available for feeding the dairy herd. 

The Sweetpotato As a Feed 
For Dairy Cows 

Although the sweetpotato is grown 
largely for human food, a portion of each 
crop fails lo meet the market require- 
ments and there are times when attrac- 
tive prices cannot be obtained. To de- 
termine the value of this crop as a suc- 
culent roughage for dairy cows, the Dairy 
Department of the Experiment Station 
compared its feeding value with sorghum 
silage. 

Two groups of five cows each were 
used. The test lasted 84 days. Both 
groups received the same amount of a 
grain mixture consisting of 100 pounds of 
cottonseed meal, 100 pounds of wheat 
bran, 200 pounds of crushed ear corn, 
4 pounds each of oystershell flour and 
common salt. In addition each cow re- 
ceived 10 pounds of Johnson grass hay 
daily. 

The cows in group 1 received 30

PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION OF SILAGE IN MISSISSIPPI

pounds of sorghum silage daily and those 
in group 2 were given ISYz pounds of 
chopped sweetpotatoes. Table 19 gives 
the results. 

In this trial the silage and sweetpotatoes 
fed were of equal value in the produc- 
tion of milk and butterfat. The cows 
fed silage gained only 0.20 pound per 
cow per day, while those fed sweetpota- 
toes gained 0.94 pound. 

The results indicate that for milk pro- 
duction 1 ton of sweetpotatoes is equal 
to 3636 pounds of sorghum silage. From 
these figures it is concluded that 300 
bushels of potatoes would produce as 
much milk and butterfat as 16.36 tons 
of sorghum, silage. 

SILAGE UTILIZATION BY 
OTHER LIVESTOCK 

Sheep. Silage has proved to be a satis- 
factory winter roughage for sheep when 
succulent grazing crops are not available. 
Since sheep consume a relatively small 
amout of silage it is usually not used in 
a sheep production program except where 
dairy or beef cattle are also maintained. 
The leading succulent winter feed for 
sheep is that produced from green grow- 
ing crops such as oats, rye, wheat, and 



barley with wild winter peas or crimson 
clover interplanted. Silage ranks next to 
these crops and above the better quality 
hays in stimulating milk production aft- 
er ewes yean. 

A satisfactory wintering ration for 
suckling ewes that do not have access 
to green feed is: 3 to 5 pounds sorghum 
silage, 1 pound good quality legume hay, 
V2 to 1 pound concentrates. 

It is believed by good sheepmen that 
while planning a sheep program emphasis 
should be placed on more and better 
grazing crops rather than build a program 
around silage as the principal succulent 
feed. 

Work stock There are instances where 
silage has been successfully used as part 
of the roughage for work stock. A good 
quality corn or sorghum silage, free from 
molds and rotten material, might be fed 
to work stock with safety and would 
frequently cheapen the carrying cost of 
idle work stock. However, due to the 
fact that horses, mules, and jack stock 
are extremely susceptible to attacks by 
fungi that cause forage poisoning which 
is sometimes present in moldy silage, sil- 
age cannot be recommended as a work 
stock feed.

COTTON VARIETIES IN THE HILL SECTION OF MISSISSIPPI

II The field plot data for these tests were 
! collected by S. P. Crockett, H. A. York, 
I and T. E. Ashley at their respective sta- 
tions. 

The 1945 weather conditions were 
largely unfavorable for cotton production. 

i' A cold, wet planting period caused de- 
layed planting, poor germination, and in 
some cases tests had to be planted over. 

I Only at Holly Springs did yields approach 
satisfactory levels. 

I Because of the unfavorable weather re- 
sults from the tests were more variable 



than usual. This again emphasizes the 
wisdom of studying the averages when 
trying to evaluate a variety. The current 
year's results have much of interest but 
never should be accepted as final. 

The lint prices used for the three grades 
and for the several staple lengths, are 
averages for 10 weeks of the marketing 
season. Seed was valued at $52.00 a ton 
regardless of length of staple or assumed 
grade. Because of this the total acre 
values for strict low middling and low 
middling grades are somewhat greater

than would be the case if the quaHty 
of seed comparable to such lint grades 
were known. 

Seed for these tests was obtained from 
the originator in all cases. 

The tests at Holly Springs were liber- 
ally fertilized ahead of planting. The 
planting was done early in May. Weath- 
er conditions later made possible the pro- 
duction of a satisfactory yield. 

At State College prolonged low tem- 
peratures ruined the first planting in the 
latter part of April. The second planting 
was made early in May. Rains in June 
and July were not excessive and August 



was the driest on record. Yields were 
fair. 

The Raymond and Poplarville tests 
were planted on time. Excessive rain- 
fall and insect damage prevented satis- 
factory yields. 

Farmers would do well to examine seed 
supplies available for planting in 1946 
with more than the usual care. In some 
areas rains during the harvesting season 
damaged much of the seed. Any sup- 
pHes which are at all questionable should 
be tested for germination. In some cases 
the seed may be entirely unsafe for plant- 
ing and should be discarded. Other sup-

CORN HYBRIDS AND VARIETIES IN MISSISSIPPI 



By ROBERT C. ECKHARDT, W. A. DOUGLAS, 
and A. L. HAMNER^/ 



Main Hybrid and Variety Tests 

Corn performance tests designed to de 
termine the most desirable strains, were 
continued in 1945 on five experiment sta- 
tions in Mississippi. The most promis- 
ing new hybrids from neighboring states 
were tested with the best open-pollinated 
varieties and older hybrids. 

It is well recognized that open-pollinat- 
ed varieties of corn differ greatly in adap- 
tation and performance, but many farm- 
ers do not realize that some hybrids may 
be unsuited for planting in Mississippi, 
particularly hybrids that have been bred 
for conditions differing from those ex 
isting in the South. The performance 
tests of previous years have proven clear- 
ly that most northern hybrids are unsuit- 
ed for use as full-season corns m the 
South because of poor husk extension and 
soft grain which makes them subject to 
serious insect damage. Only one north- 
ern hybrid. Pioneer 300, was included in 
the 1945 comparisons. It was included 
because a large amount of seed of it was 
offered for sale in the Delta in the spring 
of 1945. 

Each test contained 25 entries arrang- 
ed in a balance lattice square design with 
six replications. Each plot was 2 rows 
wide and 10 hills long with rows and hills 
usually spaced 40 inches apart. Four 
seeds were planted per hill and later thin-

and Plant Quarantine, Agricultural Research Ad- 
ministration, U, S. Department of Agriculture.

ned to two plants per hill, except at 
Stoneville. Stand percent at Stoneville is 
based on three plants per hill as a per- 
fect stand. Some of these tests had fer- 
tilizer applied before planting and all 
tests received at least 32 pounds of nitro- 
gen per acre. 

Seasonal Conditions 

The season of 1945 was an excellent 
one for corn, the State yield of corn in 
Mississippi averaging 20 bushels per 
acre, a 25 percent increase over 1944 and 
a 32 percent increase over the 10-year 
average, 1934-1943. Acre yields in all 
tests are high, but are indicative of what 
Mississippi can do in corn production 
when climate, cultural conditions, seed, 
and fertilizer are favorable. 

Explanation of the Data Reported 

Yields are based on 70 pounds of 
husked earcorn per bushel. Any two kinds 
of corn should differ by at least the num- 
ber of bushels shown opposite the nota- 
tion "Least significant difference (5 per- 
cent level)" before any great confidence 
can be placed on the two entries being 
really different in yielding ability. 

The percentages of plants lodged are 
based on actual counts, all plants broken 
below the top ear-bearing node (joint) 
were classified as stalk lodged, while all 
plants leaning 30 degrees or more from 
the vertical were classified as root lodged. 
Husk length is reported as the estimated 
husk extension beyond the ear tip, in 
inches. Earworm damage ratings were 
made on the basis of the amount of feed- 
ing done by the insect, 0 indicating no 
feeding and 5 extreme feeding. All other 
notes are self explanatory. 

State-Wide Results— Hybrids 

Seventeen of the 25 entries were plant- 
ed at all locations. The five station av- 
erages for these entries are reported in 
table 1. The top nine entries in yield 
were hybrids and the next to lowest was

a hybrid. Mississippi Experimental Hy- 
brid 5111 developed by the Mississippi 
Agricultural Experiment Station in co- 
operation with the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture was outstanding in yield, 
with an average of 71.1 bushels. Mis- 
sissippi Experimental Hybrid 5111 also 
had good husk extension which gave 
good protection from weevils, and had 
less damage from corn earworms than 
most of the entries. Its main fault is its 
lack of lodging resistance. Mississippi 
Experimental Hybrid 5111 is closely re- 
lated to Louisiana 468, since three of the 
four parental inbred lines are identical. 

Louisiana 468 was second in yield. 
This hybrid has done well over a period 
of years and is adapted to the entire 
State. It has the same virtues and weak- 
nesses as Mississippi Experimental Hy- 
brid 5111. 

Louisiana 1030 is a hybrid of mixed 
kernel color which is adapted to the 
southern half of Mississippi. It is the 
most earworm resistant hybrid we have 
tested, yields well, and stands well. 

Of the North Carolina hybrids tested, 



N. C. 5001 seems most promising. It 
yields about 10 percent more than Sta- 
tion Mosby, stands better and has more 
resistance to rice weevils, N. C. 4003 
also yields well, stands well, and is much 
lower eared than Mosby. 

Two Funk hybrids were tested at all 
locations. Funk G714 is by far the bet- 
ter of the two, but it was no better than 
7th in yield, stood no better than Mosby, 
and had the most stalk lodging of any 
entry. Funk G708 was exceeded in yield 
by all entries except Jarvis and had much 
stalk lodging. There seems little to re- 
commend this hybrid, which was out- 
yielded 14 percent by Station Mosby and 
38 percent by Mississippi Experimental 
Hybrid 5111. 

Open-Pollinated Varieties 

Station Mosby, Station Laguna, and 
Jellicorse were very similar in perform- 
ance, yielding well and standing better 
than some hybrids and poorer than others. 
It is apparent that these three varieties 
are better than poor hybrids, and the 
planter should be sure he buys seed of

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 427 



a superior hybrid before he discontinues 
growing a good adapted variety. 

Jarvis, as in years past, was the lowest 
yielding entry tested. It did best, rela- 
tively, at Holly Springs. 

Performance data at the individual lo- 
cations are shown in tables 4 to 8. 
Varieties Planted only in South 
Mississippi 

In addition to the entries planted at 



all stations, several varieties of corn were 
planted at Natchez and Poplarville (ta- 
bles 2, 7, and 8), Cockes Prolific (N. E. 
La. Station), Hastings, Yellow Hastings 
and Whatley Prolific all yielded about the 
same as Station Mosby.

all stations (tables 3, 4, 5, and 6). Pio- 
neer 300, a northern hybrid, was widely 
sold in the Delta and was tested at Stone- 
ville and Holly Springs. It was by far 
the lowest yielding entry at Stoneville, 
hybrid or open-pollinated, and was next 
to lowest in yield at Holly Springs. Pio- 
neer 300 is a single-eared hybrid of Corn- 



Belt type with no husk protection against 
birds or weevils. When the corn was 
harvested at Stoneville, over 50 percent 
of the kernels were weevily or rotten. 
Corn-Belt strains of this type have no 
place in Mississippi except for possible 
use as early feed.

ed variety, yielded with the other good 
open-poUinated varieties, and 32 percent 
more than Pioneer Hybrid 300. 

Variety Test 

A number of open-pollinated varieties 
are being certified in Mississippi without 
regard to performance. In order to eval- 
uate these and certain other open-pollinat- 
ed varieties, tests composed entirely of 
open-pollinated varieties were grown at 
Holly Springs, Stoneville, and Natchez. 
The data are presented in tables 9, 10, 
11, and 12. 

Six strains of Mosby were grown. The 
data on one are omitted because of poor 
germination. Station Mosby was first in 
all three tests, and was 21 bushels better 
than the next strain of Mosby at Stone- 
ville. Graham Mosby, used as the offic- 
ial Mosby by the Alabama Experiment 
Station, was next in yield. Gray Mosby 
was entirely different in plant type from 
any of the other Mosby 's, being short and 
low eared. 

Two strains of Jarvis were tested in 
the three tests and an additional strain 



tested at Holly Springs. Sewell Jarvis 
has been selected in Mississippi for a 
number of years and has lost much of 
the hard flinty characteristics of the orig- 
inal Jarvis. Johnston Jarvis also has been 
selected in the State for a number of years 
but still retains much of the Jarvis ear 
type. The Jarvis strain of Jarvis was 
purchased from Mr. Jarvis recently. 

The Sewell and Johnston strains of 
Jarvis were very similar in yield while 
the Jarvis strain of Jarvis was much low- 
er in yield. Both Sewell and Johnston 
Jarvis did relatively best at Holly Springs. 

Carraway Prolific, a yellow Louisiana 
variety, did well at Natchez, and may be 
well adapted to South Mississippi. 

Holloman Cribfiller is a white variety 
with very short plants and low ears. Ii 
is also short in yield. 

It is apparent from these data that the 
strain or source of a variety is very im- 
portant, and the general name Mosby or 
Jarvis, or any other varietal name means 
little unless one knows what strain is 
meant.

Soybean Varieties and 
Dates of Planting in the 
Yazoo- Mississippi Delta 



By 

PAUL R. HENSON and ROBERT S. CARR 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 
CLARENCE DORMAN, Director 
STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



Summary 



Uniform soybean variety tests were lo- 
cated at Tunica, Stoneville, Anchorage, 
Satartia, and Onward in 1945. Yields, 
other agronomic data, and the chemical 
composition of the strains and varieties 
have been summarized according to ma- 
turity. 

The strains CI 01 and SI 00 have yield- 
ed significantly more than Macoupin, a 
commonly known commercial variety of 
these strains maturing in early Septem- 
ber. The variety, SI 00, is taller, produces 
seed of slightly higher quality and ma- 
tures approximately 10 days later than 
ClOl. SlOO is low in oil, while ClOl is 
a good oil bean containing approximately 
2 percent more oil than SlOO. One ser- 
ious objection to these early maturing 
strains when grown in the Delta is the 
low quality of seed produced. In the past. 
Delta farmers have reported low germi- 
nation of Macoupin due to adverse con- 
ditions encountered at harvest and dur- 
ing the storage period. It is expected 
that similar problems will prevail with 
these strains. 

Ogden is definitely the highest yield- 
ing variety of those normally maturing 
between October 1 and 15. The 2-year 
average yield of this variety at Tunica, 
Stoneville, and Anchorage, was 34.5 bush- 
els or 40 percent more than the next high- 
est yielding variety. The chief objection 
to Ogden is that it shatters on certain 
soil types and under dry climatic condi- 
tions at harvest. It has been observed 
that shattering is more severe on light or 
droughty soils and on heavier soils of 
low fertility. Even on soils where shat- 
tering usually occurs, many farmers pre- 
fer Ogden to such non-shattering, lower 



yielding varieties, as Arksoy 2913 and 
Ralsoy. 

In the breeding program under way 
at the Delta Station, plants coming out 
of crosses between Ogden and other va- 
rieties are being studied. It is hoped that 
strains carrying the high yield of Ogden 
and the non-shattering habit of Arksoy 
will be developed. 

Of the varieties normally maturing the 
last half of October, Volstate and Roan- 
oke, were equally productive. These va- 
rieties are similar in many respects and 
dif?er in that the oil content of Roanoke 
is slightly higher than that of Volstate. 
Both are non-shattering, erect growing, 
and of sufificient height to combine read- 
ily. Wood's Yellow has been quite pro- 
ductive in a number of locations in the 
Delta; however, it is low in oil and shat- 
ters under dry conditions. To farmers 
growing a large acreage of soybeans, the 
practice of planting the acreage to va- 
rieties of different maturity to increase 
the optimum combining period seems ad- 
visable, particularly in the production of 
soybeans for oil. The late maturing va- 
rieties have not been as productive or as 
high in content of oil as the better varie- 
ties of earlier maturity. The yields of 
strictly grain types, such as Mamotan, 
Mamloxi, Delsta, and Nanda have not 
been greatly different from those of the 
tall growing Louisiana strains, Acadian, 
L. Z., and Pelican. These late varieties 
are particularly well suited for inter- 
planting in corn in that they usually ma- 
ture after the corn crop is made. Appre- 
ciably lower seed yields were obtained 
from the hay varieties, Avoyelles, Gatan, 
Red Tanner, and from two vegetable 
varieties, Cherokee and Seminole. 



SOYBEAN VARIETIES AND DATES OF PLANTING 
IN THE YAZOO-MISSISSIPPI DELTA^^ 

By PAUL R. HENSON and ROBERT S. CARR^/ 



Soybean variety and dates of planting 
tests have been conducted at the Delta 
Experiment Station, Stoneville, Missis- 
sippi, for a number of years. In 1943 
the program of the U. S. Regional Soy- 
bean Laboratory ^ was enlarged to in- 
clude 12 southern states with headquarters 
for the Southern section at Stoneville, Mis- 
sissippi. As a part of this program, uni- 
form variety tests have been conducted at 
a number of locations in the Yazoo-Mis- 
sissippi Delta. The results of these varie- 
ty tests and a study of the dates of plant- 
ing at the Delta Station are reported 
herein. 

Soybean Variety Tests in the Yazoo- 
Mississippi Delta 

Uniform variety tests were again con- 
ducted at a number of locations on the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta to determine the 
adaptation of these varieties and strains to 
Delta conditions. Tests in 1945 were 
made in Tunica, Washington, Sunflower, 
Humphreys, Leflore, Yazoo, and Sharkey 
Counties. 

Since the normal maturities of exist- 
ing soybean varieties that may be adapted 
to the Delta range from mid-August to 
mid-November, the varieties were group- 
ed according to their maturity in order 

i/Cooperative investigations between the U. 
S. Department of Agriculture; the Bureau of 
Plant Industry, Soils and Agricultural Engineer- 
ing; the U. S. Regional Soybean Laboratory; and 
the Mississippi Agricultural Fxpcriment Station.

^"An organization participated in by the Bu- 
reau of Plant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural 
Engineering, Agricultural Research Administra-

.Agricultural Experiment Stations of Alabama, 
Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and 
VVisconsin." 



to obtain more accurate information of 
the performance of each one. The group- 
ing was as follows: (1) Early strains, 
maturing prior to September 15; (2) me- 
dium strains, October 1 to October 15; 
(3) medium-late strains, October 16 to 
November 1; and (4) late strains, which 
mature after November 1. At present 
there are no promising varieties which 
normally mature between September 16 
and October 1. The origin of the varie- 
ties and strain, included in the tests, 
grouped according to maturity is given 
in table 1. 

Plant height and lodging notes were 
taken on the varieties as they matured. 
Yields were determined from the weight 
of seed harvested from a 16-foot section 
of the four one-row plots of each variety. 
All yields were analyzed statistically to 
determine whether the differences be- 
tween varieties were significant. In this 
connection the two seasons at some loca- 
tions were so different primarily in the 
amount and distribution of rainfall, that 
che yield and rank of some varieties was 
quite different. Because of this year-va- 
riety interaction, the differences required 
tor significance between varieties in the 
2-year averages are unusually high at some 
locations. Fair to excellent yields were 
obtained on all tests except those at Heath- 
man and Greenwood. The Heathman 
test failed as a result of the extreme 
droughty condition at the time of plant- 
ing. Livestock grazed the test at Green- 
wood destroying the comparative value of 
any yields. 

Notes on seed quality and size were 
taken on each variety. A seed compos- 
ite of each variety was taken for analysis. 
All analyses were made at the U. S. Re- 
gional Soybean Laboratory of Urbana, Illi- 
nois. Average yields for 1944 and 1945, 
the 1945 yields, other agronomic data, 
percentage of protein, percentage of oil, 
and iodine numbers of the oil, are sum-

Tunica Tests 

The most northern tests in the Delta 
were located in Tunica County, on High- 
way 61, in cooperation with Richard W. 



Owens, landowner, and D. D. Gibson, 
county agent. The soil, a Dubbs silt 
loam of high fertility is a major soil type 
of that section. No fertilizer was applied 
to the area in 1945. The land was thor- 
oughly disked and the beans planted flat

in 38-inch rows on May 4th. The va- 
rieties and strains of early, medium, and 
medium-late groups were tested in this 
location. 

Of the early group, the Missouri strains, 
SlOO, S55-35, S55-10, and the Indiana 
strains ClOl have all yielded well at Tu- 
nica, with SlOO and ClOl yielding equally 
high at Stoneville, the only other location 
at which this group was grown. Many 
of the early strains not only failed to 
provide sufficient ground cover to check 
weed growth, particularly in late sum- 
mer, but are frequently too short to com- 
bine readily. In this connection, SlOO 
provides fair ground cover and combines 
easily since it is a tall growing variety. 
All of these strains are lacking in seed 
quality. Chemical analyses of the seed 
show SlOO to be lower in percent oil 
than the other varieties. 

Ogden was again the highest yielding 
variety of those of medium maturity. 
This variety shatters on certain soil types 
under dry climatic conditions. Other 
good yielding varieties are Rose Non-Pop, 
Armredo, and Ralsoy. Delsoy yielded 
well but shattered badly. The protein and 
oil contents of the higher yielding va- 
rieties are relatively high with the ex- 
ception of Delsoy, a variety definitely low 
in oil. 

Volstate and the North Carolina strain, 
Roanoke, were the higher yielding va- 
rieties of those normally maturing be- 
tween October 16 and November 1. Va- 
rieties of this maturity were not grown 
at Tunica in 1944. 

Stoneville Tests 

The tests on the Experiment Station al 
Stoneville were located on Robinsonville 
very fine sandy loam, commonly known 
to farmers in this vicinity as Deer Creek 
loam. It is a fertile soil, frequently pro- 
ducing in excess of one bale of cotton 
or 50 bushels of corn per acre. In 1945 
the field was plowed, thoroughly disked, 
and the soybeans planted flat in 40-inch 
rows on May 22. The soybeans were not 
fertilized. The varieties and strains of all 



maturity groups were grown at Stoneville. 

Relatively high yields were obtained in 
1945 from all strains of the early group 
at Stoneville as shown in table 2. ClOl 
and SlOO are the leading varieties for the 
2 years, 1944-45, with yields of 33.4 and 
33.3 bushels per acre, respectively. 

As at Tunica, the Ogden variety, ma- 
turing October 4. led the medium group 
with a 2-year average yield of 38.6 bush- 
els, which was 11.9 bushels or 44 percent 
above that of the next highest yielding 
variety. 

Of the varieties maturing at a medi- 
um-late date, i. e., October 16 to Novem- 
ber 1, Roanoke, Volstate, and Wood's 
Yellow were the highest yielding at 
Stoneville in 1945. Wood's Yellow, how- 
ever, shatters more and yielded signifi- 
cantly less than either of the other two 
varieties in 1944. Volstate and Roanoke 
have consistently been the highest yield- 
ing varieties of this maturity. The oil 
content of the seed of Roanoke is slight- 
ly higher than that of Volstate. 

Grain or oil, hay, and vegetable types 
are included in the late group. None of 
the late varieties was outstanding in yield. 
Equally good yields were secured from 
the grain varieties, Manotan, Mamloxi, 
and Delsta. The Pelican, Acadian and L. 
Z., developed by the Louisiana Experi- 
ment Station, are intermediate grain-hay 
types and have given fair yields at Stone- 
ville. The yields of grain from the hay 
varieties, Avoyelles, Gatan, and Red Tan- 
ner, are low for the group. Nanda, long 
considered a vegetable variety, was equal 
to the best of these varieties in content 
of oil and but slightly lower in yield. The 
vegetable varieties, Seminole and Chero- 
kee, introductions from Hangchow, 
China, by the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture, are not particularly well adapted 
^o Delta conditions. 

Anchorage Tests 

The tests at Anchorage, in Humphreys 
County, were located on a fertile Yazoo 
silt loam on the plantation of L. S. Stoner.

cation have been well above the average 
for the Delta in past years. The test area 
was thoroughly prepared and planted flat 
in 38-inch rows on May 3. The varieties 
and strains of the medium and medium- 
late groups were grown at Anchorage. 

In the medium group, Ogden, with a 
yield of 33.6 bushels led all other varieties 
by more than 10 bushels per acre as shown 
in table 3. The 2-year average yield of 
Ogden of 37.4 bushels per acre, as com 
pared to 26.3 bushels for the next highest 
yielding variety, is indicative of the su 
periority of Ogden. 

In the medium-late group, table 4, the 
yields of Volstate and Roanoke were sig- 
nificantly greater than that of any othei 
variety in the group. The 2-year average 
of these two varieties was slightly less 
than 30 bushels per acre. 

Satartia Tests 

The tests at Satartia, in Yazoo County, 
were located on Vicksburg silty clay 
loam, and conducted in cooperation with 
M. F. Cresswell, landowner, and A. R. 
Ruby, county agent. The medium-late and 
late groups of varieties were grown a» 
this location. The area was thoroughly 
disked and the tests planted flat in 40 
inch rows on May 3. The level of fer- 
tility of this soil is high, usually produc- 
ing in excess of a bale of cotton per acre 

In the medium-late group Roanokt 
made the greatest yield, 38.7 bushels per 
acre. Wood's Yellow and Volstate rank 
ed second and third, with yields of 31.3 
and 29.7 bushels, respectively. In the late 
group, table 5, yields of Mamloxi, Mamo- 
tan and Nanda were approximately the 
same and were significantly greater than 
yields of the other varieties. 

Onward Test 

The test at Onward, in Sharkey Coun 
ty, was located on Sharkey clay common- 
ly known as "buckshot," on the Reality 
Plantation of J. H. Hand, Jr. The me- 
dium and medium-late groups were 
planted at this location. The land was 
well prepared and the soybeans planted 
flat in 40-inch rows on June 1. 



In the medium group, as given in table 
3, Ogden and Rose Non-Pop made sig- 
nificantly greater yields than that of all 
other varieties. These were approximate- 
ly 10 bushels greater than the average for 
the test. The highest yielding varieties in 
the medium-late group for this one year 
were Wood's Yellow, Roanoke, and Vol- 
state; however, all yields were relatively 
low. Wood's Yellow was lower in per- 
cent oil than the other two varieties. 

Dates of Planting Soybeans 

Each year a part of the soybean acre- 
age in the Delta is planted on a poorly 
prepared seedbed, frequently too dry for 
prompt germination, because of the pos- 
sibility of not getting soybeans planted 
in time for maximum production. The 
stands secured from such plantings are 
usually thin and weedy. Poor stands re- 
sult in lower yields at higher costs, be- 
cause of the necessity for additional hand 
labor for hoeing. The Delta Experiment 
Station has for a number of years con- 

The date of planting test, as planned 
ducted dates of planting tests to determ- 
ine the best period for planting soybeans, 
for 1945, consisted of four replications of 
five varieties of soybeans to be planted at 
3-week intervals beginning April 2 and 
continuing through July 16. Excessive 
rains in late March and early April de- 
layed the first planting until April 13. 
The next planting was delayed accord- 
ingly for better adjustment of the time in- 
tervals between the first three plantings. 
The five varieties planted at each date 
were SlOO, Arksoy 2913, Ogden, Volstate, 
and Acadian; these varied in normal ma- 
turity from early September for SlOO to 
early November for Acadian. Plant 
height and lodging notes were taken as 
the varieties approached maturity. Yields 
were based on harvested weight of seed 
from a 16-foot section from each row. 
Notes were taken on the threshed sam- 
ples to record the effect of date of plant- 
ing on seed quality and size. Samples of 
seed were composited by variety and date 
of planting for chemical analysis. Yields

SOYBEAN VARIETIES AND DATES OF PLANTING

were not taken on the varieties planted 
July 1:6 because of poor stands. The 
stands of Acadian planted June 24 were 
so badly damaged by rabbits that com- 
parable yield data could not be obtained 
of this variety. 

The 1945 average yields of the varie- 
ties at each date of planting are given in 
table 6. These yields closely substantiate 
the results of tests of previous years. 
Since these results are more complete than 
previous years data, only the data for 1945 
are given. Each variety yielded equally 
well at the different planting dates from 
April to early June, although the data in- 
dicate slightly lower yields from the plant- 
ing of June 4. The yields of all varie- 
ties planted June 25 were significantly 
lower than those of earlier plantings. 

Since the results show but small differ- 
ences in yield between early April to early 
June plantings, it is of interest to note 
the effect of date of planting on the ma- 
turity of the various varieties. The 2- 
year data as given in table 7 is very in- 
teresting in this regard. The maturity 
of the early variety, SlOO, was affected 
much more by date of planting than the 



later varieties. The differences in matur- 
ity dates between early and late plantings 
was 26 days for SlOO and 18, 6, and 2 
days for Ogden, Arksoy, and Volstate, 
respectively. It is of particular interest 
to note that Ogden in the early plantings 
matured 5 days ahead of Arksoy and 
7 days later when planted June 4. The 
spread in maturity of Ogden from early 
to late plantings of 18 days suggests the 
possibihty of planting this variety at dif- 
ferent dates to increase the length of the 
combining period. Such a practice would 
be a desirable one for Delta farmers, since 
Ogden in particular does shatter under 
very dry conditions if not combined 
promptly. 

Late plantings usually result in shorter, 
more erect plants. The later plantings 
in 1945, because of well distributed rain- 
fall in July through September, were as 
tall and lodged to the same degree as the 
earlier plantings. The results also indi- 
cate better seed quality from later plant- 
ings. Chemical analyses of the seed of 
the varieties have indicated a slight de- 
crease in oil content with the later plant- 
ings. The oil content of seed from late

June and July plantings has been con- 
sistently low. 

In conclusion, the dates of planting 
tests have shown that soybeans may be 
planted from early April to early June 
with equally good results. This long 



planting period should enable Delta farm- 
ers to readily fit soybeans into their plant- 
ing schedules. The results indicate the 
optimum combining period of the Og- 
den variety of soybeans can be increased 
by early and late plantings.

Cotton Production Costs in Northeast Mississippi, 1944 

By W. J. EDENS 



Much is known about growing cotton, 
and much is known about the marketing 
of cotton, but httle is known concerning 
the actual cost of producing this crop by 
the vast majority of farmers who produce 
it. 

Most of the farmers in Northeast Mis- 
sissippi produce cotton. In fact, cotton 
has been the principal income crop since 
the area was settled. Yet the many who 
have farmed the soils of Northeast Mis- 
sissippi and throughout the South, have 
seldom kept records to compare the costs 
with market prices, when the margin be- 
tween these two values mean so much to 
the well-being of the farmer and his fam- 
ily. 

It was with the idea of learning the 
cost of producing cotton, and some of 
the farm management problems confront- 
ing farmers in its production, that an at- 
tempt was made by the Mississippi Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station in 1944 to 
get some farmers in several counties of 
Northeast Mississippi interested in keep- 
ing records necessary to determine cost 
of producing this crop. 

This article is based on a larger study 
of farm costs and farm management 
practices where much emphasis was plac- 
ed on the production of milk. The Kraft 
Cheese Company was interested in this 
kind of work and helped finance it. 

Farms selected for keeping records 
were located in three of the State's ma- 
jor soil areas, namely: Northeast High- 
land, Northeast Prairie, and Pontotoc 
Ridge. The farms who kept records were 
located in the counties of Alcorn, Pren- 
tiss, Lee, Chickasaw, and Noxubee. Farms 
keeping records were further selected on 
the basis of emphasis placed on the pro- 
duction of cotton and milk, and farm 
types were so designated. 

Farms with a large number of cows 
compared with the number of acres in 
cotton comprised one group, or dairy- 



cotton farms. Where the number of 
acres in cotton was large in proportion to 
the number of cows, the farm type was 
designated cotton-dairy. The farms hav- 
ing about the same number of cows as 
acres in cotton constituted the third type, 
or dairy & cotton. Of the 40 farms keep- 
ing records, 16 were dairy-cotton, 12 were 
cotton-dairy, and 12 were dairy & cotton. 
Thirty-two of the farms produced cotton 
and all 40 produced market milk. 

Items of Cost 

A study of table 1 shows the amount 
of cost items for the average cotton en- 
terprise on 32 farms. The average cost 
of each item is shown for the total cotton 
enterprise, one acre of seed cotton, one 
500-pound bale and seed, 500 pounds of 
lint, total lint, total seed, the cost of pro* 
ducing one pound of lint, and the propor- 
tionate part each item of cost was of the 
total cost of producing one pound of lint. 
Items of cotton cost are discussed in the 
following paragraphs. 

Man labor. It will be observed, table 
1, that man labor was the largest item of 
costs in producing cotton. The total- 
man-labor cost for the average cotton en- 
terprise on 32 farms in Northeast Missis- 
sippi was $1,089. This labor cost was 
$50 per acre of cotton grown, $51 per 
500 pound bale and seed, and $40 per 
500 pounds of lint. Man-labor cost per 
pound of lint was 8.04 cents, which con- 
stituted 60.5 percent of the total cost to 
produced 1 pound. Consequently, any 
steps taken by farmers to reduce the cost 
of producing cotton will necessarily in- 
clude the consideration of man-labor. 

The man labor required to grow an 
acre of cotton amounted to 141 hours, 
and only 3 hours more were required to 
produce a 500-pound bale since produc. 
tion was so near 1 bale per acre. The 
range in hours required per acre of cot- 
ton on the 32 farms was from 63 hours

*Cost of lint cotton is determined by the total costs of seed cotton minus total value (amount 



received) of seed. 



to 176 hours. Barring the fact that there 
were differences in the yield per acre 
among farms, there still would be much 
room for increasing the efficiency of la- 
bor. And since this cost item was 60.5 
percent of the total cost of production, 
farmers could well look to using available 
labor on the farm, as well as hired labor, 
to a more distinct advantage. 

Horse labor* Labor performed by 
workstock held the second place in mag- 
nitude of cost. Horse labor used to pro- 
duce cotton averaged |195 per farm, or 
$8.95 per acre. The cost of horse labor 
to produce 1 pound of lint cotton was 
1.42 cents or 10.8 percent of the total 
cost to produce 1 pound. 

Land. Land costs (interest or invest- 
ment, taxes, improvements) per farm for 
the cotton enterprise on 32 farms in 
Northeast Mississippi was $67. This 
amounted to $3.08 per acre, and $3.14 
per 500-pound bale and seed. The land 



cost per 500-pound bale of lint was $2.47 
and the average cost per pound of lint 
was $0,005. This land cost of one-half 
cent per pound of lint was 3.7 percent of 
the total cost to produce a pound of lint. 
The average value per acre of land only 
for the 32 farms was $23.96, and the to- 
tal farm investment per acre was $63.20. 

Fertilizer. All but six of the 32 farms 
used fertilizer in the production of cotton. 
Fertilizer costs for cotton were $107 per 
farm, or $4.92 per acre. This was con- 
siderably more than the annual cost of 
land per acre. The fertilizer expense 
per pound of lint was 0.79 cents, or ,6 
percent of the total cost of 13.28 cents to 
produce a pound of lint. 

Manure. Twenty-six of the 32 farms 
growing cotton applied manure in its 
production. The amount used was very 
small, since the average value of manure 
applied per acre on farms growing cotton 
was only $1.76, or $38 per farm. Thus, 



COTTON PRODUCTION COSTS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI, 1944 



5 



the manure cost per pound of lint cotton 
was 0.28 cents. This was 2.1 percent of 
the total cost of producing one pound of 
Hnt. 

Cottonseed. Cottonseed for planting 
cost $43 per farm and $1.97 per acre of 
cotton. This expense amounted to 0.32 
cents per pound of lint and 2.4 percent 
of the cost of producing one pound of 
lint. 

Tractor expense. Tractor expense for 
producing cotton averaged $22 per farm 
for the farms growing cotton. Seventeen 
of these farms owned tractors. Since the 
average cost per hour for operating trac- 
tors was 49 cents, it is readily seen that 
the tractors were used only for a few 
hours on the cotton enterprise. When 
tractors were used, it was principally for 
plowing early in the year. 

Other equipment. Other equipment 
consisted of all equipment on farms ex- 
cept tractors. This cost averaged $54 
per farm, or $2.48 per acre for the equip- 
ment used in producing cotton. Equip- 
ment cost per pound of lint amounted to 
0.40 cents or 3 percent of the total cost 
to produce 1 pound of lint. 

Ginning. The expense of ginning av- 
eraged $108 per farm and $4.96 per acre 
of cotton. The cost averaged $5.06 per 
500-pound bale. This charge was fairly 
standard in all communities. Ginning 
cost was 0.08 cents per pound of lint and 
6 percent of the total cost to produce 1 
pound of lint. This cost per pound of 
Unt was twice that of farm equipment 
and almost twice the annual cost of land. 
As an expense of production, ginning 
came next in importance after man- and 
horse-labor costs. 

Miscellaneous costs. Miscellaneous costs 
amounted to $3.53 per acre and 0.57 cents 
per pound of lint. This expense was 4.3 
percent of the total cost of producing 1 
pound of lint. 

Total costs of producing cotton. The 
average cost of producing the cotton en- 
terprise on each of the 32 farms was 



$1,800, which amounted to $83 per acre. 
See table 1. The cost to produce 500 
pounds of lint was $66, which gave a 
cost of 13.28 cents per pound. The re- 
turn from one acre of cotton for lint and 
seed was $104 and $17.57, respectively. 

The total return from the enterprise 
per farm was $2,646, thereby leaving a 
profit of $846 for the cotton enterprise 
and $38.90 per acre produced. With a 
cost per pound of lint at 13.28 cents and 
an average price of 21.21 cents received 
per pound, this gave a profit of 7.93 cents 
per pound of lint to the farmers growing 
cotton. 

Costs of Cotton Production on Different 
Type Farms 

Table 2 shows the average amount of 
cotton produced per farm for 32 farms in 
Northeast Mississippi as well as the 
amounts produced on dairy-cotton, cotton- 
dairy, and dairy & cotton farms. Items 
of cost of production are also given. 

There was much variation in the acre- 
age devoted to cotton production on the 
three types of farms. Range was from 
9.1 acres per farm on dairy -cotton farrns 
to 39.9 acres on cotton-dairy farms. Dairy 
& cotton farms produced 12.1 acres, which 
was only 3 acres more than was produced 
on dairy-cotton farms, and less than one- 
third of the acres grown on cotton-dairy 
farms. The number of acres produced 
on the five low-cost farms and the five 
high-cost farms was about the same, and 
approximately the same as was produced 
on dairy & cotton farms. 

The items of cost in the production of 
cotton varied considerably in value for 
the three types of farms. Man-labor per 
acre, the most important cost item, was 
least on dairy-cotton farms and most on 
cotton-dairy farms, $28 and $54, respec- 
tively. This cost was $49 per acre on 
dairy & cotton farms. Horse-labor costs 
followed the same pattern. The low cost 
of man-labor to produce an acre of cot- 
ton on dairy-cotton farms probably was 
due more to the smaller yield of cotton

per acre than to more efficient use of 
labor on dairy & cotton farms. 

Fertilizer costs varied from $2.39 per 
acre on dairy-cotton farms to $5.32 on 
cotton-dairy farms. The five farms pro- 
ducing cotton at the least cost per pound 
used $5.33 worth of fertilizer per acre. 
The total cost of producing a pound 
of lint on the three types of farms did 
not vary much, but was least on the 
dairy & cotton farms. See table 2. It 
will be seen that the cost of production 
per pound on the five low cost farms 
was only 8.24 cents, while on the five 
high cost farms the cost to produce 1 
pound of lint was 17.17 cents. 

Cotton Returns On Different 
Type Farms 

Total returns per acre of cotton were 
the smallest on dairy-cotton farms. See ta- 
ble 2. This is largely the reflection of a 
low yield per acre for this type of farm- 
ing. The average return per acre for all 



types was $122; for dairy-cotton, $84; 
for cotton-dairy, $124; and for dairy & 
cotton, $132. Profits per acre were $39, 
$27, $38, and $48, respectively. The five 
farms producing cotton at the lowest 
cost per pound — 8.24 — had a profit of 
$75 per acre; whereas, $18.38 was the 
profit per acre on the five farms produc- 
ing cotton at the highest cost per pound, 
which was 17.17 cents. 

Considering returns and profits as a 
whole, it appears that the yield per acre 
was the most important factor determ- 
ining the cost to produce a pound of 
cotton and the return the farmer got for 
his labor. 

Labor Efficiency 

Using labor to the best advantage is 
one of the most important problems with 
which farm operators deal. Labor re- 
quirements are much greater for some 
enterprises than for others, and at the 
same time, the demand on all farms for 



COTTON PRODUCTION COSTS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI, 1944 



7 



labor is highly seasonal, particularly for 
crops. Labor requirements for crops 
constitute the largest cost item in their 
production. For cotton, this cost amounts 
to 60.5 percent of the total expenses of 
growing the crop. Labor requirements 
for corn, hay, and other crops were some- 
what less, but still were the highest sin- 
gle cost item. 

Work units per man available on farms. 
The amount of labor accomplished per 
man varied from farm to farm, and as 
the available man equivalent per farm 
increased, the acres of cropland per farm 
increased. Farms with an average of 38 
acres of cropland had an average of L63 
man equivalent of labor available. (Ta- 
ble 3). 

Since the amount of work accomplish- 
ed per man available for work on the 
farm decreased as the size of business 
(measured by crop acres) increased, far- 



mers operating large acreages should give 
more attention to using more efficiently 
the labor they have available under their 
management. It will be noticed that the 
acres of cropland per man did not vary 
much whether on a small farm or a 
large farm, yet the cost to produce an 
acre of cotton, or a pound of cotton, was 
greater as the size of farm business in- 
creased, and as the labor performed per 
man available decreased. The fact that 
larger farms had the most tenants, and 
since it was on these farms that labor 
was used less efficiently, this would tend 
to explain the unfavorable relationship 
of cropland per man and the greater cost 
of producing cotton on the larger farms. 

Man-hours per acre of cotton* The la- 
bor used per acre of cotton varied very 
much also. See table 4. Seven farms av- 
eraged only 77 man-hours per acre, while 
a like number of farms averaged 168

^Man work units accomplished per man available was determined by dividing the total hours of 
productive work accomplished per farm by the man equivalent of labor found on the farm. The 
operator and man cropper tenants were considered as one man each available for 12 months of 
work. Family labor of the operator and family labor of the man cropper were converted to the 
equivalent of man labor.

hours. As the man-hours per acre in- 
creased, the pounds of cotton produced 
per acre increased, which was unHke the 
relationship of labor expended per cow 
and the milk produced per cow. How- 
ever, as the pounds of cotton per acre and 
labor per acre increased, the cost to pro- 
duce an acre of cotton increased. Unlike 
the application of labor to cows, as labor 
on cotton per acre increased, the cost to 
produce 1 pound of lint decreased and 
the labor return per hour increased up 
to 150 hours per acre and then decreas- 
ed. Consequently, a farmer should be 
very careful about increasing the hours 
of labor used per cow and the labor used 
per acre of cotton above 150 hours under 
conditions similar to those on the 40 
farms in Northeast Mississippi. The part 
of his total time as operator of the farm 
that should be devoted to the entire dairy 
enterprise is another problem and should 
be considered in the organization of the 
entire farm business. 

Rates of Production 

Pounds of cotton per acre. The pro- 
duction of lint cotton per acre ranged 
from 196 pounds to 837 when consid- 



ering all farms. Seventy-five percent 
of all farms growing cotton had an av- 
erage yield above 400 pounds per acre 
and 44 percent of the farms producing 
cotton had a yield above 500 pounds. See 
table 5. 

As production per acre increased, man 
hours and total cost per acre increased. 
Likewise, profit per acre and labor re- 
turn per hour increased. The farmers 
who produced above 700 pounds per acre 
received nearly one dollar per hour for 
their labor used on cotton. 

Types of Farming 

The yield of cotton per acre varied con- 
siderably on the 32 farms producing it. 
Table 6 shows this variation by types of 
farming. Cotton-dairy farms grew four 
times the acreage of cotton as was grown 
on dairy-cotton farms and a little more 
than three times the amount grown on 
dairy & cotton farms. The yield per 
acre was slightly more than a bale per 
acre on both cotton-dairy and dairy & cot- 
ton farms, whereas the yield was only 
2/3-bale per acre on dairy-cotton farms. 

The cost of producing a pound of cot- 
ton varied little between types of farms,

but varied considerably between individ- 
ual farms. The cost per pound on dairy- 
cotton and cotton-dairy farms was 13.3 
and 13.5 cents, respectively. 

The cost to produce a pound of cotton 
on dairy & cotton farms was 12.4 cents, 
or 1 cent less than for the other farm 
types. The range in cost to pro- 
duce a pound of cotton on the 32 farms 
was from 6.67 cents to 21.16 cents. Sev 
enty-five percent of the farms produced 
cotton at a cost range from 10 to 16 cents 
per pound, with an average cost of 13.3 
cents for all farms. 

Labor returns per hour spent on cot- 
ton averaged 63 cents for the 32 farms. 
Low yields per acre undoubtedly account 
for the low labor return on dairy-cotton 
farms. On the other hand, yields were 
approximately the same for cotton-dairy 
and dairy & cotton farms. Yet, the re- 
turn per hour of labor on dairy & cotton 
farms was 33 percent higher than on 
dairy-cotton farms. This difference was 
due largely to the fact that the cotton- 
dairy farms used 31 hours more labor 
per acre, or 26 percent more than was 
used by dairy & cotton farms. 

Soil Fertility 

Detail soil maps for each of the 40 
farms in this study were furnished by 
the Soil Conservation Service of Missis- 
sippi and the Bureau of Plant Industry. 
These maps were used to study in detail 
soil types on each farm. A staff member 
of the Experiment Station Soils depart- 
ment assisted in this work by making a 
visit to each farm to study the types of 



soils, placing special emphasis on the 
fertility of the soils and the adaptability 
of crops to the soils on which they were 
being grown. Farms were then classed 
as high, medium, and low in fertility, 
for the purpose of finding relationships 
between farms of different fertility levels 
and the costs of production and income. 

Soil fertility related to costs and re- 
turns. Half of the farms in the Black 
Prairie Area were classed high in fer- 
tility. One-half the farms in the North- 
east Highland Area were low in fer- 
tility, and 85 percent of the farms in 
the Pontotoc Ridge Area also were class- 
ed low in fertility. 

For the areas as a whole, the cost to 
produce one pound of cotton increased 
as soil fertility decreased. See table 7. 
The difference in costs between farms 
of high fertility and low fertility was ap- 
proximately 2 cents per pound. With a 
market price of 20 cents for cotton, a 
spread of 2 cents per pound amounts to 
$10 per bale. Interest at 5 percent on an 
investment of $200 amounts to $10. Con- 
sequently, it would appear that a farmer 
can afford to pay considerably more for 
land of high fertility when purchasing 
land for the purpose of growing cotton. 
The rate of cotton production was great- 
er on farms of high soil fertility, as 
would be expected. This, of course, was 
a major factor influencing the smaller 
cost of producing a pound of cotton on 
these farms.

which it is best adapted usually gives 
the highest labor returns. Progressive 
farm operators give much thought to 
placing crops in their farm layouts so 
that this relationship exists. Table 8 
shows the relationship of the adaptation 
of crops to soils on the 40 farms in this 
study. On 22 farms, the adaptation of 
crops to soils on which they were grown 
was "good"; on 14 farms, "fair"; and on 
4 farms it was "poor." The adaptation 
of crops to soils on the farms as a whole 
was used as a basis for the above classi- 
fication. 

The rate of production was highest 
where soil crop adaptation was good. It 
cost 12.42 cents to produce a pound of 
lint cotton where adaptation was good, 
15.05 cents where it was fair, and 15.17 
cents where adaptation was poor. 

The cost to produce a bushel of corn 



was 94 cents where soil crop adaptation 
was good, $1.10 where it was fair, and 
$1.41 where soil crop adaptation was 
poor. The cost of producing cotton per 
pound was 23 percent greater on farms 
with poor soil crop adaptation than on 
farms when the soil crop adaptation was 
good. 

It cost 50 percent more to produce corn 
on farms where the soil crop adaptation 
was poor than where the soil crop adap- 
tation was good. Also, it will 
be observed that labor return per hour 
spent on cotton was 73 cents where soil 
crop adaptation was good, 61 cents where 
it was fair, and 54 cents on farms where 
it was poor. Labor income was highest 
on farms where soil crop adaptation was 
good and lowest on farms with poor soil 
crop adaptation.

Recommendations 

In summary, the findings of this study 
appear to suggest the following recom- 
mendations: 

Grow cotton on soils of high fertility. 
The cost to produce cotton on farms of 
high soil fertility was 12.58 cents per 
pound, whereas the cost was 14.67 cents 
on farms of low soil fertility, or a cost 
spread of nearly 2 cents. This spread 
of cost between high and low fertility 
farms was nearly 4 cents per pound in 
the Black Prairie Area. On land that 
produced between 700 and 800 pounds 
of lint per acre, the profit on each acre 
was |83. On land that produced between 
200 and 300 pounds of lint, the profit 
per acre was only |15. 

Use labor more efficiently. The av- 
erage cost to grow a pound of hnt was 
13.28 cents. Labor amounted to 8.04 
cents of this cost, or 60.5 percent of the 
total cost to produce a pound of lint 
cotton. On farms where the average la- 
bor performed per man available was 
less than 100 days during the year, the 
man labor cost to produce one pound of 



lint cotton was 9.3 cents. Where the 
days of labor per man were 250 and 
above, the man labor cost was 5.2 cents 
per pound. 

Grow crops on soils to which they are 
best adapted. On farms where soil-crop 
adaptation was good, the cost to produce 
a pound of cotton was 12.42 cents, and 
the cost to produce a bushel of corn was 
94 cents. Where soil-crop adaptation was 
poor, the cost was 15.17 cents per pound 
for cotton and $1.41 per bushel for corn. 

Reduce costs by increasing rates of 
production. Farms that produced cotton 
at the lowest cost had the highest yields, 
or 1.14 five-hundred-pound bales per 
acre, and farms producing cotton at the 
highest cost had the lowest yields or 0.78 
five-hundred-pound bale per acre. 

Large farms should use available labor 
more fully. Days of work (10-hour 
days) per man on farms with more than 
three man-equivalents available, averaged 
less than 125 for the year. Days of 
work per man on farms with 1.6 man- 
equivalents available averaged 310 for 
the year.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 5 



Farm Management and Costs of Production on 40 Farms 
in Northeast Mississippi 

By W. J. EDENSi 



This bulletin reports a study, by the cost account method, of 40 
dairy and cotton farms in Northeast Mississippi for the calendar year 
1944. The purpose of the study was to determine farm costs and 
farm management practices in their relation to production problems 
and income, especially on farms producing milk for sale, and with 
possible recommendations for adjustments. Attention in particular 
is given to the costs of producing milk and cotton in their relation- 
ship to types of farm organization, and profits derived from these 
major enterprises as well as from minor enterprises and the farm 
business as a whole. It is hoped that the results of this study will 
stimulate farmers of the area to give more thought to the organiza- 
tion of their farms and to utilize more efficiently the land, capital, 
and labor under their management, and will serve as a means of 
facilitating the agricultural extension program of this State. 

Most of the farms in Northeast Mississippi produce cotton and 
a large number keep milk cows. Cotton has been the principal 
income crop since the area was first settled. Since the turn of the cen- 
tury, it has been demonstrated that a single row-crop enterprise as 
the main source of income involves considerable risk and does not 
give a return to the farm business as a whole comparable to that 
which is realized when income enterprises are more diversified. 
Consequently, farmers and various agricultural agencies have been 
endeavoring to find the best means and methods to be used in pro- 
viding the most profitable combination of enterprises for farms in 
each of the naturally defined areas of the State. 

Emphasis has been placed on more livestock production as well 
as improved practices in growing crops. For the past three decades, 
much attention has been given to dairying as a supplement to cotton 
production. Agricultural and various business and civic agencies have 
encouraged the establishment of milk processing plants such as cheese 
factories, creameries, and condenseries in many communities of the 
State with most of the larger plants located in Northeast Mississippi. 
Fifty-seven of these plants have been established since 1912. At 
present, 31 are in operation with most of the fatalities having oc-

curred among creameries. Nineteen of the 31 plants now in opera- 
tion are located in the 11 counties constituting the Northeast Mis- 
sissippi Milkshed Area.' 

With the coming of these plants, the dairy cow population in the 
respective communities, or patronage areas, increased considerably. 
Many thought that this step in farm enterprise diversification would 
solve the one-crop system of farming. It has helped; but the prob- 
lems have arisen such as low production per cow, unprofitable 
methods of feeding, high-cost transportation, low production during 
winter months making it difficult for milk plants to operate effi- 
ciently during that period, and dairy cattle diseases, and parasites. 
While some farmers appeared to be profiting by adding dairying to 
their business, others appeared to be deriving little benefits from 
milking cows along with the production of cotton. 

Since so many factors — size, rates of production, combination 
of enterprises, use of labor, farm practices — are responsible for de- 
termining the profit made by the farm business, it was thought that 
if a study were made of representative farms where milk was pro- 
duced and sold to milk plants so that detailed attention could be 
given to those factors largely determining profits, much benefit 
might be derived for both farmers and milk plants. 

Location of Fanns Studied 

Farms selected to cooperate in this study were located in Alcorn, 
Prentiss, Lee, Chickasaw, and Noxubee Counties, all of which are 
found in the three major soil areas of Northeast Mississippi, namely, 
Northeast Highlands, Northeast Prairie, and the Pontotoc Ridge. 
(See figure 1.) Though the Northeast Prairie Area separates the 
Northeast Highlands and Pontotoc Ridge Areas, the soils of all three 
areas are rather distinct. 

The Northeast Highland Soil Area developed mostly from coastal 
plain deposits of sand, clay, and gravel. They are red or yellow 
wherever the drainage is good, and are generally quite sandy in tex- 
ture. The rugged topography of parts of the area and poor solid 
management practices have contributed to severe erosion of the soil 
on many farms. The commonly occurring soils of the Northeast 
Highlands are Ruston, Savannah, Cuthbert, Paden, and Ocklocknee. 
The principal crops grown in this area are cotton, corn, oats, les- 
pedeza, cowpeas, and soybeans. In addition to the field crops, pine 
timber affords a cash income in several locations. 

The soils of the Northeast Prairie are derived from soft, chalky 
limestone and clays which are coastal plain deposits. Because of the 
nature of the parent material, the soils possess texture of the clay 
and heavy clay classes. The topography is gently rolling and sheet 
erosion has wrought great damage to much farm land. The soils 
are easily recognized by the dark and red colors, and vegetation of 
grass and post oak. The dark soils are Houston, Sumpter, and Trinity,

commonly called "Black Prairie", and the red soils are Oktibbeha 
and Montrose, commonly called "Post Oak Prairie." The crops 
grown are cotton, corn, oats and silage crops, and much livestock is 
fed. Johnson grass is well adapted to this area and is used for hay 
along with soybeans. Dallis grass and white and hop clovers, make 
excellent pastures in this area and contribute much to the production 
of livestock. 

Soils of the Pontotoc Ridge Area have developed from marine 
deposits of sands and clays that are reddish in color, and naturally 
the soils are predominantly reddish in color. The texture varies 
from a sandy loam to clay. The topography is rolling to rough and 
rugged. Thus, the soils have suffered severe damage from accele- 
rated erosion where protective measures have not been applied. The 
main soils are Greenville, Orangeburg, and Ruston, on uplands, and 
Hannahatchie and Ocklocknee. The principal crops are corn and 
cotton for row crops ; lespedeza, soybeans, and cowpeas for hay. 
Pine timber also contributes to the income of the farmers.' 

Method of Selecting Farms 

Farms selected for this study were suggested by county agricul- 
tural agents, milk plant managers and their field men, county repre- 
sentatives of the Agricultural Adjustment Agency, and local repre- 
sentatives of the Soil Conservation Service. These agricultural 
leaders were requested by personal interview to suggest farmers who, 
they thought, were progressive in their fatm operations, would be 
interested in making a study of their farm business, and would be 
willing to keep the necessary records. 

The enterprise organization of each farm was studied by means 
of the 1944 farm plan sheets made available by the several county 
AAA officers. Farms were then divided into three groups de- 
termined by the emphasis placed on the production of milk and cotton, 
and farm types were so designated. Farms with a large number of cows 
compared with the number of acrps in cotton comprised one group, or 
dairy-cotton farms. A few farms in this group did not grow cotton 
after having planned to do so. Where the number of acres of cotton 
was large in proportion to the number of cows, the farm type was 
designated cotton-dairy. The farms having about the same number 
of cows as acres of cotton constituted the third type, or dairy & cotton. 
Of the 40 farms keeping records, 16 were dairy-cotton, 12 cotton- 
dairy, and 12 dairy & cotton. This manner of grouping was selected 
in order that comparisons could be made relative to cost factors and 
income for the various farm enterprises under different organiza- 
tional conditions. 

Operators of the farms thus selected were interviewed on th'^ir 
farms where consent was obtained to keep the necessary rcords. The 
supervision of the keeping of the records was done by a member of 
the Experiment Station staff, and each farm was visited once every 
4 weeks. 



iThe description of thevSe thrpe soil f^rpas was taken lar^plv from their description 
as set forth by the Mississippi State Department of Agriculture, 1942. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 



Description of Farms Studied 

Land Utilization 



The average amount of land per farm for the 40 farms was 170 
acres. Table 1 shows how the total land for all farms as a whole and 
by types of farms was used. Cropland accounted for 75 acres per 
farm, or 44 percent of total land. Open, tillable pasture land amount- 
ed to 43 acres per farm, representing 25 percent of all land ; and open 
non-tillable pasture land amounted to 21 acres, or 12 percent. Thus, 
81 percent of all land was open land. Woods pastured accounted for 
8 percent of the land per farm; woods not pastured, 5 percent; and 
the other land used for miscellaneous purposes, 5 percent. It will 
be noted that pasture land of all kinds amounted to 88 acres, or 
slightly more than one-half of the total average acreage per farm. 

On farms where cotton was the major enterprise, 55 percent 
of the land was cropland. Where dairy cows were the major enter- 
prise, 30 percent of the land was cropland ; and where the two enter- 
prises ranked about the same, 42 percent of the land was devoted to 
crops. It will be noted that where major emphasis was placed on 
dairy cows, slightly more than half of the total land was devoted to 
open pasture. Where cotton received major emphasis, only 30 per- 
cent of the farm acreage was used for open pasture land.

Crop Acres 

On the average, more acreas of land were devoted to corn than to 
cotton. Com and cotton acreages were about the same on cotton- 
dairy farms. Hay constituted the largest acreage of any crop. 
Table 2 shows the relative importance of crops grown. Other than 
cotton, cash crops were relatively unimportant on most farms. Two 
:farms produced hay for sale and one raised watermelons and 
cantaloupes for the market. It will be noted that less than one-half 
' acre per farm was used for growing silage crops. Only six farmers 



10 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



grew silage. These six farms grew an average of 2 acres per farm.

1. Crop acres — Total acres of crops, includes double cropping. 

2. Double-cropping acres are included in the above crop acreages. 



On farms where dairying was the major enterprise, 74 percent 
of the acres cropped was devoted to feed crops; on cotton-dairy 
farms, 69 percent; and on dairy & cotton farms, 69 percent. Acres 
of oats per farm averaged 6.8. However, only 14 of the 40 farms 
actually growing oats had an average of 19.4 acres per farm. 

Hay was an important crop on most of the farms. Johnson 
grass predominated in the Northeast Prairie Area, but in the Ponto- 
toc Ridge and Northeast Highland Areas, soybean acreage for hay 
was greatest. Lespedeza was next in importance. A considerable 
number of farms interplanted corn with soybeans and harvested the 
plants for hay or stocked them down. Most of the farmers growing 
soybean hay, ground it before feeding it to dairy cows and other 
livestock. 

Classes of Livestock 

Dairy cows were the most numerous livestock on the average 
farm. Table 3 shows the importance of all classes of livestock. The 
average number of dairy cows per farm was 14, with a total value 
of $981 per farm, or an average value of $69 per cow. Milk cows 
constituted 47.3 percent of the total farm investment in li^^esto'ck. 
The range in number of dairy cows for all farms was from 4 to 40. 
Only two farms milked less than 6 cows; 4 less than 7 cows; and 10 
less than 10 cows. Nine farms milked 20 or more cows. Nineteen 
herds averaged 4,000 pounds per cow or more, and 8 had an average 
production of more than 5,000 pounds of milk per year. The range in 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 11 



the amount of milk produced per cow per year was from 2,200 
pounds to 5,800 pounds with 4 herds producing less than 3,000 
pounds per cow.

2. Average for 39 farms. 



Other cattle' amounted to 11 head per farm and 19.2 percent of 
the total average* investment in livestock. Other cattle consisted of 
bred heifers, steers, bulls, and calves. Hogs were of minor im- 
portance on more than 75 percent of all farms. A few farmers raised 
hogs for the market while all others grew hogs primarily for home 
consumption, selling the small surplus produced. 

Most poultry flocks were for home use. However, a majority 
of the farms sold some eggs and a few sold young birds. Nine farms 
had more than 100 hens, and 4 had more than 150 hens. 

Table 3 shows the importance of workstock. Next to milk cows, 
the largest investment in livestock was in the enterprise used for 
farm power. 

Farm Invesiment 

The investment per farm amounted to $10,743. The distribution 
of this investment is shown in table 4. Cotton-dairy farms had the 
largest investment, as might be expected on account of larger crop- 
land requirements. Dairy-cotton and dairy & cotton farms were 
more nearly equal in real estate investment and total investment.

Table 5 shows the relative distribution of farm investment for 
all farms as well as for types of farms. The average investment in 



1 All cattle other than milk cows. Only one farm had beef cattle. 



12 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



real estate for the 40 farms was 60.2 percent. On cotton-dairy 
farms the investment in real estate was 68 percent, while dairy- 
cotton and dairy & cotton farms had a real estate investment of 52.5 
and 56.1 percent, respectively. Investment in livestock was lowest 
on cotton-dairy farms. The relative investments in feeds and equip- 
ment were about the same. 

On farms where dairy cows were the major enterprise and on 
farms where cows and cotton received about the same emphasis, the 
total investment per farm was approximately one-half of the invest- 
ment on farms where cotton was the major enterprise. The percent 
return on investment for cotton-dairy farms was 10.4, on dairy- 
cotton farms 14.4 percent, and 16.2 percent on dairy & cotton farms.

Farm Receipts and Expenses 

Farm receipts are the total income from farm sources. They 
include money received or due from the sale of the current year's 
crops, sale of livestock and livestock products, sale of equipment and 
supplies, and any increase in the inventory value of the farm property. 
Farm receipts for the 40 farms averaged $5,930. (See table 6.)

*The operator's labor waa valued at current wages for a hired man without 
meali and lodging for 12 montha. Unpaid family labor was valued at the same rate. 

Farm expenses represent the cost of operating the farm busi- 
ness, except for interest on investment and value of the operator's 
time. Farm expenses include all cash expenses for labor, feed, 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 13 



supplies, taxes, etc. ; the value of unpaid family labor other than the 
operator's ; the value of board furnished hired help ; the cost of live- 
stock and equipment purchased; and any decrease in the inventory 
value of farm property. Farm expenses, or farm business expenses, 
do not include family living expenses. The average farm expenses 
for 40 farms was $3,973. 

Farm Retiums 

Farm income and other measures of return to the farm operator 
are also shown in table 6. Farm income, which is farm receipts less 
farm expenses, amounted to $1,957 for the 40 farms as a whole. 
Deducting from farm income the amount of interest at 5 percent 
on the average investment, gives a labor income of $1,420. Labor 
earnings are found by combining labor income and farm privileges.' 
This amounted to $2,010 per farm. 

The operator's time was valued at current wages paid hired 
labor without board and lodging in Northeast Mississippi, as reported 
by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. All operators were credit- 
ed with 12 months of labor except one who spent some of his time 
off the farm. 

Return on the average farm investment was $1,400 or 13 percent. 
The operator's time may have been undervalued. If that were true, 
the percentage return on investment would be less in proportion to 
the increase of the value of the operator's time. 

Farm receipts and expenses for the different types of farms 
varied directly with the size of the investment. However, it will 
be noticed that labor income did not vary much from one type to 
another. Causes for these differences and similarities will be dis- 
cussed in following sections of this study. 



Methods Used in Determining the Costs of Producing Milk 

All farm costs were determined by means of a set of accounts 
kept by each farmer. Records began with taking an opening in- 
ventory, January 1, 1944, and included transactions during the year 
pertaining to the farm business. The closing inventory was taken 
December 31. Daily labor records, feeding records, production 
records, cash records, and other records were kept. Methods used 
in keeping these records follow. 

Feed. Feeds fed to dairy cows were both purchased and pro- 
duced on the farm. Most concentrates were purchased, whereas, 
practically all roughages were grown by the farmer. Purchased 
feeds were charged at market price, and home-grown feeds were 
charged at farm price. Farm price was market price less the cost 
of transportation to the market. 

The amount of feeds fed was recorded monthly. Once each 
month — usually the latter part of the month — the farmer determined 
the pounds of concentrates and roughages fed to his herd for one day, 
and multiplied these amounts by the number of days in the month. 



iPann privileges means contributions made by the farm to family living, such 
aa house rent and foods. 



14 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



If changes occurred in the kinds of feed fed during the month, or if 
the number of cows in the herd increased or decreased, this was taken 
into consideration in order not to overcharge or undercharge the 
proper amounts. The pasture cost was computed by determining 
the total pasture cost for all livestock and then allocating the pro- 
portionate part to the milk cows. This cost was estimated by the 
farmer. 

Pasture. Pasture costs included interest on investment in pas- 
ture land, taxes, man and horse labor used on the pastures, and the 
cost of pasture fences. Crops grazed, such as oats, were charged 
at the rate of $3.00 per month for each milk cow. 

Man labor. The charge for man labor was the average cost per 
hour for all labor on the farm except that of cotton croppers. Crop- 
per cotton Inbor was charged directly to the cotton enterprise. Thus, 
the cost per mar hour for all enterprises other than cotton was the 
average cost per hour on the farm for all labor except labor spent 
on cotton by cropper tenants. In addition to cash wages, labor costs 
included the value of the operator's time, unpaid family labor, and 
the use of tenant houses. The average rate per hour was determined 
by dividing the total labor costs, less the value of the cropper's share 
of the cotton and seed, by the total hours of work less the hours spent 
on cotton by croppers. The total cost of man labor for milk cows 
was completed by multiplying the average farm labor hour rate by 
the total hours spent on milk cows. Hours of labor spent on cows 
included the time spent in milking, feeding, cleaning milk house, and 
washing utensils. 

Buildings. The cows were charged with their proportionate 
part of the cost of maintaining building for the year. This cost 
included repairs, depreciation, interest on investment, insurance and 
taxes. The total expense for any building used entirely for milk cows 
was charged to the herd. 

Dairy equipment. The investment in equipment for most herds 
was small. This cost included depreciation, repairs, and interest 
on investment. 

Depreciation on coivs. Depreciation on milk cows was de- 
terminated by using the following formula: depreciation equals (value 
of cows at the beginning of year plus value of heifers freshening 
plus value of cows purchased) minus (value of cows at the end of 
year plus value of cows sold and any that died). This charge for 
depreciation accounts for both depreciation in the case of young 
cows and depreciation for old cows. 

Interest. Milk cows were charged with interest at the rate of 
5 percent on the average of the beginning and ending inventories 
values. 

Milk hauling. Practically all farmers hired the hauling of their 
milk to the milk plants. Where the farmer hauled his own milk, man 
hours and the proportionate part of the truck, or car, costs used for 
handling the milk were estimated by the farmer. 

Miscellaneous costs. Miscellaneous costs included such items 
as the proportionate part of truck or auto expense, electricity, sprays, 
disinfectants, veterinary services, medicines, etc. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 15 



Costs and Returns for Milk Production 

Milk was produced for sale on all farms. About 12 percent of 
all milk produced was used on the farm. Practically all of the re- 
maining 88 percent was sold to cheese plants and condenseries. A 
few farmers sold their milk to wholesale distributors. 

The average number of milk cows per farm was 14. (See table 7.) 
This average number of milk cows per herd was computed from the 
beginning and ending inventories and five other inventories during 
the year. Milk produced per farm amounted to 55,991 pounds, or 
3,931 pounds per cow. The family used 3,861 pounds of milk, and 
the average farm fed 2,729 pounds of milk to calves. 

A study of table 7 shows the amount of costs for the various 
items entering into the total costs for the average dairy herd as well 
as per cow and per 100 pounds of milk. This table also shows herd 
credits, such as manure and calves produced, and the returns from 
milk produced. Detail consideration is given to these items in the 
sections that follow.

Feed Costs 

Feed was the largest item of cost in the production of milk. (See 
table 7.) The feed cost per herd for one year on all farms averaged 
$1,109. Of this, concentrates amounted to $608; roughage, $372; and 
pasture, $129. This total feed cost amounted to 59.6 percent of total 
milk production costs. On a per cow basis, this feed cost per year 
was $78, and the feed cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $1.98. 

The amount of feed per cow varied considerably, and much of this 
variation was due to whether there was available suitable land for 
hay and pasture production in the three soils areas in Northeast 
Mississippi — Black Prairie, Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge. 
The five farms feeding the least concentrates averaged 642 pounds 
per cow. The five farms feeding the most concentrates averaged 
2,898 pounds per cow. The five farms feeding the least roughage 
averaged 969 pounds per cow, and the five farms feeding the most 
roughage averaged 5,157 pounds per cow. The capacity of milk cows, 
the knowledge of farmers relative to desirable feeding standards, 
and high feed costs were other factors contributing to the wide varia- 
tion in the amounts of feed fed on various farms. 

Tables 8 and 9 show the relationships of concentrates and rough- 
ages fed per cow to milk produced per cow, and the cost to produce 
100 pounds of milk. When concentrates fed per cow were increased, 
milk produced per cow increased. On the other hand, when rough- 
age per cow was increased, there was a slight decrease in the amount 
of milk produced. The cost to produce milk increased as the amount 
of both concentrates and roughage fed per cow was increased.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 17 



dairy-cotton farms, cotton-dairy farms, and dairy & cotton farms, 
as well as for the five lowest cost' farms and the five highest 
cost' farms. 

Concentrates fed during the year to cows on dairy-cotton farms 
amounted to $50.51 per cow, which was the highest value of the three 
types of farms. This could be expected on farms where farmers 
placed the most emphasis on the dairy enterprise. However, these 
same farms had the least roughage cost of $23.70 per cow, compared 
with $32.14 for cotton-dairy farms, and $24.66 for dairy & cotton 
farms. Total feed costs were the greatest on dairy-cotton farms, 
next on cotton-dairy, and least on dairy & cotton farms. 

The five farms producing milk at lowest cost, fed $43.10 worth 
of feed per cow, and the five farms producing milk at the highest cost 
fed $96.34 worth of feed. Since cows on high cost farms produced 
only 3,230 pounds each, this would indicate that these farm operators 
were attempting to get high production out of cows of low efficiency. 

Man Labor Casts 

Labor used to produce milk was furnished primarily by members 
of the operator's family. A fevr farmers hired some labor for the 
dairy enterprise, paying cash wages, a part of the milk check, or by 
allowing the helper so much milk for family use. Farm labor was 
very scarce in 1944 and, consequently, high priced. Due to this fact, 
labor costs were relatively higher than other fixed costs as buildings, 
equipment, depreciation on cows, and interest charges. 

The cost of labor per herd was $507 as shown in table 7. The 
average number of man hours spent on one cow per year was 145, 
and was valued at $35.62. This amounted to 91 cents per 100 pounds 
of milk produced. The labor cost range for 100 pounds of milk was 
from 46 cents to $1.65. The amount of labor used per cow for one 
year ranged from a low of 96 hours for the 10 lowest farms to a high 
of 209 hours per cow for the 10 farms requiring the greatest amount 
of labor. The average cost of labor per hour spent on milk cows on 
all 40 farms was 24.5 cents. The range for this man-hour costs was 
from 16.4 cents to 39.5 cents. In producing milk, man labor ac- 
counted for 27.3 percent of the gross farm cost to produce 100 pounds 
of milk. Consequently the efficient use of labor is an important 
factor in producing milk economically.

1. The cost of producing 100 pounds of milk. 

The cost of producing milk on dairy and cotton farms was lowest and profit per 
cow was highest. Dairy and cotton farms spent less for feeds, less than average 
for labor, and had the highest production per cow. 

Building Costs 

Milk cows were charged with building costs on the basis of the 
proportionate part of the barn used by the cows. This cost amounted 
to $34.47 per herd for the year, or $2.42 per cow. The building cost 
per 100 pounds of milk produced was $0.06. 

Equipment Costs 

Equipment cost per herd amounted to $18.05. The cost per cow 
for one year was $1.27, and the cost per 100 pounds of milk produced 
was $0.03. 

Depreciation Costs 

The depreciation on the average herd of cows was $82.71. This 
amounted to $5.81 per cow, or 15 cents per 100 pounds of milk pro- 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 19 



duced. This cost accounted for 4.4 percent of the total gross farm 
cost of producing milk. 

Interest Cost 

Interest cost at 5 percent on the average investment in the herd 
amounted to $48.75. This v^as equivalent to $3.42 per cow and about 
$0.09 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Miscellaneous Costs 

Miscellaneous costs v^ere $59.83 per herd, or $4.20 per cow. This 
cost amounted to about $0.10 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Gross Farm Costs 

The gross farm costs per herd for the year was $1,860. Thus, 
the average gross cost to keep a cow for one year was $130.61, and 
this amounted to $3.32 per 100 pounds of milk produced. The range 
of cost for keeping a cow for one year on the entire 40 farms was 
from $73 to $257. The range in cost of producing 100 pounds of 
milk was from $1.77 to $5.56. 

Credits 

Each cow was credited with 5 tons of manure since this was the 
estimated amount that was saved per cow. The manure was valued 
at $1.50 per ton. Credit for calves produced amounted to $2.00 per 
cow. Total credits were $137.17 for each herd or $9.63 per cow. 
This credit amounted to $0.24 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Net Form Costs 

Net farm costs are gross farm costs less total credits. Net farm 
costs amounted to $1,723 per herd as shown in table 7. This gave 
a net cost of $121 per cow and $3.08 per 100 pounds of milk produced. 

Hauling Charges 

Charges for hauling milk to the milk plant for the year amounted 
to $126 per herd, $8.85 per cow, and about $0,025 per 100 pounds of 
milk. When adding this cost to net farm costs, it gives a cost of $3.33 
per 100 pounds of milk delivered at the plant. 

Returns For Milk Sold 

The amount of milk sold per farm was 49,401 pounds, or 3,468 
pounds per cow. This amount of milk delivered at the milk plant sold 
for $1,987. Thus the average price received for 100 pounds of milk 
by the farms was $4.02. This price per 100 pounds was slightly 
above the average milk plant price for the area due to several of the 
farms producing grade A milk for army camps and for starter milk 
at cheese plants. This better grade of milk sold at a premium. 

Milk Used on the Farm 

Milk used for personal purposes per farm amounted to 3,861 
pounds per herd, and milk fed to calves was 2,729 pounds per farm. 
Thus the total amount of milk used on each farm had a farm value 
of $232. 



f 

20 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 

Profit 

Profit was determined by deducting farm costs and hauling 
charges (total costs) from total milk returns. Total milk returns per 
herd amounted to $2,219. Net farm costs per herd plus hauling 
charges amounted to $1,849. Thus the profit per herd was $370 
and per cow, $25.99. The profit per 100 pounds of milk was the 
average price received ($4.02) less the total cost per 100 pounds 
($3.33), and amounted to $0.69. 

Labor Return 

Assuming that profit on the enterprise is also a return to labor, 
the total return to labor would be profit on the enterprise plus man 
labor charges to the enterprise. The sum of $370 (profit) and $507 
(labor charges) gives a labor return of $877. This amounts to $61.61 
per cow, and $1.59 per 100 pounds of milk sold. 

What a farmer receives for his labor is of paramount importance 
to him. He has opportunities to use his labor in various ways and 
that combination of ways which gives the greatest return for the 
farm business as a whole, is the one he is continually seeking. These 
ways of using labor, of course, take form in the various enterprises 
conducted on the farm. 

Much of the labor used on the farms in this study was unpaid 
family labor. Oftentimes this labor may be used on an enterprise 
when the cost of production is relatively high, particularly where it 
is convenient to engage in that enterprise, and still receive income 
that adds to the well-being of the farmer and his family. In case of 
the dairy enterprise, the farmer charges the cows with grain, hay, 
and other feeds at farm value (market value less transportation 
costs) instead of what they actually cost. Consequently, an enter^ 
prise may show a loss when its physical input costs are charged at 
farm value, yet the farmer can afford to go right along producing 
the enterprise and will be better off by doing so unless some alterna- 
tive enterprise opportunity appears whereby he can get more for his 
input costs or values. 

Of the 10 farms that made minus incomes on dairy cows, only 
3 made a minus labor return per cow. One farmer lost $31 per cow, 
but his labor return per cow was $30 and the labor return per hour 
spent producing milk was $0.17. Another farmer had a loss of $4 
per cow, yet his labor return per cow was $51 and the return per 
hour spent on milk cows was $0.32. If profit and loss had been 
computed on the basis of actual costs of producing feed on the farm, 
the return for labor would have been considerably more. Therefore, 
if a farmer receives the cost of production for 100 pounds of milk 
or a hundred pounds of cotton, that price includes the current wage 
rate for his labor and for all unpaid family labor. However, farmers 
are entitled to a fair profit above actual costs, as is expected in any 
other business, in order that they build up reserves for depression 
periods and for old age. 

Costs and Returns per Cow on Different Type Farms 

A study of table 10 shows costs and returns for the dairy enter- 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 21 



prise by types of farming on a per cow basis. The average costs and 
returns per cow for the 40 farms is repeated for comparative pur- 
poses. 

The annual net cost to keep a cow for one year on dairy-cotton 
farms amounted to $120. The costs on cotton-dairy farms were 
$130, and $113 on dairy & cotton farms. The annual profit per cow 
was $36 for dairy-cotton farms. There was a loss of $7 per cow for 
cotton-dairy farms, and a gain of $42 on dairy & cotton farms. It 
will be noticed that the profit was considerably greater on the farms 
where there was balanced emphasis on milk cows and cotton. Also, 
it will be noticed that cows on the dairy & cotton farms produced an 
average of 4,392 pounds of milk. That was a production of 400 
pounds per cow above the dairy-cotton farms, and 1,000 pounds more 
than on cotton-dairy farms. Feed costs and net farm costs per cow 
were less than on the other two types of farms. 

The differences between farm types pointed out in the preceding 
paragraph are favorable to those farmers who placed about the same 
emphasis on both cotton and milk cows in their farm program. Since, 
dairy & cotton farms used fewer man hours per cow, spent less for 
feed, and got a higher production from their cows, it would seem 
that their cows were more profitable because labor was used more 
efficiently and their cows were more efficient in converting feeds 
into milk. The pounds of concentrates fed per cow on dairy & cotton 
farms were about the same as fed on the other types of farms. The 
roughage fed per cow was from 200 to 400 pounds less per cow. 
Pasture conditions on dairy & cotton farms were somewhat better 
than on dairy-cotton farms and about the same as on cotton-dairy 
farms. 

Labor returns per cow were likewise greater on dairy & cotton 
farms. This return was 118 percent greater, or more than twice as 
great as the labor return on farms where emphasis was placed mainly 
on cotton. It was, however, only 9 percent greater than labor return 
per cow on farms placing major emphasis on the dairy enterprise. 



Cotton Production Costs and Returns 

Cotton was produced on 32 of the 40 farms on which records 
were kept. An average of 21.8 acres of cotton was produced on 
each farm. Actual bales ginned per farm was 20.2 or nearly one 
bale per acre. The number of 500-pound bales produced per farm 
was 21.3. The average price received per pound of lint cotton for 
all farms was 21.21 cents, and the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 13.28 cents. 

A study of table 11 shows the amount of cost items for the 
average cotton enterprise on 32 farms. The average cost of each 
item is shown for the total cotton enterprise, one acre of seed cotton, 
one 500-pound bale and seed, 500 pounds of lint, total lint, total seed, 
the cost of producing one pound of lint, and the proportionate part 
each item of cost was of the total cost of producing one pound of lint. 
Items of cotton cost are discussed in the following paragraphs. 



./ 

22 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 

Man Labor 

It will be observed, table 11, that man labor was the largest item 
of costs in producing cotton. The total man-labor cost for the aver- 
age cotton enterprise on 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi was 
$1,089. This labor cost was $50 per acre of cotton grown, $51 per 
500-pound bale and seed, and $40 per 500 pounds of lint. Man-labor 
cost per pound of lint was 8.04 cents, which constituted 60.5 percent 
of the total cost to produce one pound. Consequently, any steps taken 
by farmers to reduce the cost of producing cotton will necessarily 
include the consideration of man labor. 

The man labor required to grow an acre of cotton amounted to 
141 hours, and only 3 hours more were required to produce a 500- 
pound bale since production was so near one bale per acre. The 
range in hours required per acre of cotton on the 32 farms was from 
63 to 176. Barring the fact that there were differences in yield per 
acre among farms, there still would be much room for increasing 
the efficiency of labor. And since this cost item is 60.5 percent of 
the total cost of production, farmers could well look to using available 
labor on the farm, as well as hired labor, to a more distinctive ad- 
vantage.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 23 



Horse Labor 

Labor performed by workstock held the second place in magni- 
tude of cost. Horse labor used to produce cotton averaged $195 per 
farm or $8.95 per acre. The cost of horse labor to produce one pound 
of lint cotton was 1.42 cents, or 10.8 percent of the total cost to 
produce one pound. 

Land 

Land costs (interest on investment, taxes, improvements) per 
farm for the cotton enterprise on 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi 
was $67. This amounted to $3.08 per acre and $3.14 per 500-pound 
bale and seed. The land cost per 500-pound bale of lint was $2.47, 
and the average cost per pound of lint was 0.5 cent. This one-half 
cent land cost per pound of lint was 3.7 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound of lint. The average value per acre of land only 
for the 32 farms was $23.96. Total farm investment per acre was 
$63.20. 

Fertilizer 

All but six of the 32 farms used fertilizer in the production of 
cotton. Fertilizer costs for cotton were $107 per farm or $4.92 per 
acre. This was considerably more than the cost of land per acre. 
The fertilizer expense per pound of lint was 0.79 cent, or 6 percent 
of the total cost of 13.28 cents to produce a pound of lint. 

) Manure 

Twenty-six of the 32 farms growing cotton applied manure in its 
production. The amount used was very small, since the average 
value of manure applied per acre on farms growing cotton was only 
$1.76 or $38 per farm. Thus the manure cost per pound of lint cotton 
was 0.28 cent. This was 2.1 percent of the total cost of producing one. 
pound of lint. 

Cottonseed 

Cottonseed for planting cost $43 per farm and $1.97 per acre of 
cotton. This expense amounted to 0.32 cent per pound of lint and 
2.4 percent of the cost of producing one pound of lint. 

Tractor Expense 

Tractor expense for producing cotton averaged $22 per farm 
for the farms growing cotton. Seventeen of these farms owned 
tractors. Since the average cost per hour for operating tractors was 
49 cents, it is readily seen that the tractors were used only for a few 
hours on the cotton enterprise. When tractors were used, it was 
principally for plowing early in the year. 



24 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Other Eqiiipment 

Other equipment consisted of all equipment on farms except 
tractors. This cost averaged $54 per farm or $2.48 per acre for the 
equipment used in producing cotton. Equipment cost per pound of 
lint amounted to 0.40 cent, or 3 percent of the total cost to produce 
one pound of lint. 

Ginning 

The expense of ginning averaged $108 per farm and $4.96 per 
acre of cotton. This cost averaged $5.06 per 500-pound bale. This 
charge was fairly standard in all communities. Ginning cost v^as 
0.80 cent per pound of lint and 6 percent of the total cost to produce 
one pound of lint. This cost per pound of lint was twice that of farm 
equipment and almost twice the cost of land. As an expense of pro- 
duction, ginning came next in importance after man and horse labor 
costs. 

Miscellaneous Costs 

Miscellaneous costs amounted to $3.53 per acre and 0.57 cent per 
pound for lint. This expense was 4.3 percent of the total cost of 
producing one pound of lint. 

Total Costs of Producing Cotton 

The average cost of producing the cotton enterprise on each of 
the 32 farms was $1,800, which amounted to $83 per acre. (See table 
11.) The cost to produce 500 pounds of lint was $66, which gave a 
cost of 13.28 cents per pound for lint cotton. This return from one 
acre of cotton for lime and seed w^as $104 and $17.57, respectively. 
The total return from the enterprise per farm was $2,646, thereby 
leaving a profit of $846 for the cotton enterprise and $38.90 per acre 
produced. With a cost per pound of lint at 13.28 cents and an average 
price of 21.21 cents received per pound, this gave a profit of 7.93 cents 
per pound of lint to the farmers growing cotton. 

Costs of Cotton Production on Different Type Farms 

Table 12 shows the average amount of cotton produced per farm 
for 32 farms in Northeast Mississippi as well as the amounts produced 
on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton farms. Items of 
cost of production are also given. There was much variation in the 
acreage devoted to cotton production on the three types of farms. 
The range was from 9.1 acres per farm on dairy-cotton farms to 39.9 
acres on cotton-dairy farms. Dairy & cotton farms produced 12.1 
acres, which w^as only 3 acres more than was produced on dairy-cotton 
farms, and less than one-third of the acres grown on cotton-dairy 
farms. The number of acres produced on the five low-cost farms 
and the five high-cost farms was about the same, and approximately 
the same as was produced on dairy & cotton farms.

1 Based on cost per pound of lint. 



The items of cost in the production of cotton varied considerably 
in value for the three types of farms. Man labor per acre, the most 
important cost item, was least on dairy-cotton farms and the most 
on cotton-dairy farms, $28 and $54 respectively. This cost was $49 
per acre on dairy & cotton farms. Horse labor costs followed the 
same pattern. The low cost of man labor to produce an acre of cotton 
on dairy-cotton farms probably was due more to the smaller yield of 
cotton per acre than to more efficient use of labor on dairy & cotton 
farms. 

Fertilizer costs varied from $2.39 per acre on dairy-cotton farms 
to $5.32 on cotton-dairy farms. The five farms producing cotton at 
the least cost per pound used $5.33 worth of fertilizer per acre. The 
total cost of producing a pound of lint on the three types of farms did 
not vary much, but was least on dairy & cotton farms. (See table 12.) 
It will be seen that the cost of production per pound on the five low 
cost farms was only 8.24 cents, while on the five high cost farms, the 
cost to produce one pound of lint was 17.17 cents. 

Cotton Returns on Different Type Forms 

Total returns per acre of cotton was, the smallest on dairy-cotton 
farms. (See table 12.) This is largely the reflection of a low yield per 
acre for this type of farming. The average return per acre for all 
types was $122; for dairy-cotton, $84; for cotton-dairy, $124; and for 
dairy & cotton, $132. Profits per acre were $39, $27, $38, and $48, 



26 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 

respectively. The five farms producing cotton at the lowest cost per 
pound — 8.24 cents — had a profit of $75 per acre, v^hereas $18.38 was 
the profit per acre on the five farms producing cotton at the highest 
cost per pound, which was 17.17 cents. 

Considering returns and profits as a whole, it appears that the 
yield per acre was the most important factor determining the cost to 
produce a pound of cotton and the return the farmer got for his labor. 



Costs and Returns for Other Enterprises 

Cosis and Returns on Corn 

Thirty-seven of the 40 farms keeping records produced corn. 
Acres per farm averaged 25.3 and the production per acre was 23.3 
bushels. On the average, 27.8 man hours and 26.7 horse hours of 
labor were required per acre.

The total average cost per farm for the corn enterprise was 
$563, or $22.23 per acre. (See table 13.) With a production of 23.3 
bushels per acre, this resulted in a cost of 95.5 cents per bushel. 
Again, as can be seen, the largest item of cost was labor. Man labor 
cost amounted to 35 percent of the total cost to produce a bushel of 
corn. Horse labor accounted for 28.3 percent. It will be recalled 
that the proportionate part of the total cost to produce one pound of 
cotton was 60.5 percent for man labor and 10.8 percent for horse 
labor. In the case of corn, horse labor has assumed a larger part of 
the cost. Again it will be noticed that the land cost to produce a 
bushel of corn was 13.8 cents. This amounts to 14.5 percent of the 
total cost to produce a bushel of corn, whereas the land cost to produce 
a pound of cotton was 0.5 cent, or 3.7 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 27 



The total return per farm from the corn enterprise was $714, or 
$28.19 per acre. The average farm value per bushel was $1.25. 
With a cost of 95.5 cents per bushel, this gave the farmers a profit of 
$151 for the corn enterprise, $5.96 per acre, and 25.5 cents per bushel. 
The labor return per hour spent on corn was $0.49. 

Costs and Returns for Hogs 

Thirty-eight of the 40 farms produced hogs. Only a few farmers 
produced for the market. Sales by others were for the purpose of 
disposing of a small surplus produced. 

Table 14 shows that it cost $12.41 gross to produce 100 pounds 
of live pork. Of this amount 83.5 percent was for feed. On an 
average, 306 pounds of corn valued at $7.54, 82 pounds of other feed 
valued at $2.66, and pasture valued at 16 cents constituted the kinds, 
amounts, and values of feeds fed to produce this 100 pounds of live 
pork. It required 5.8 hours of man labor per 100 pounds of pork 
valued at $1.46 which represented 11.8 percent of the total cost to 
produce 100 pounds of pork. 

Considering credits of manure and miscellaneous credits which 
amounted to $0.38 per 100 pounds, the net cost to produce 100 pounds 
was $12.03. The value per 100 pounds of live pork produced was 
$12.53, which left a profit of $0.50 per 100 pounds. This small profit 
on producing hogs was due to the unfavorable hog-corn ratio in 
Northeast Mississippi in 1944.

Workstock Costs 

Workstock was used on all farms and there was an average of 
4.3 head per farm. Each head of workstock worked 462 hours, or 46 
work days of 10 hours each during the year. The average cost for all 
farms was 22.9 cents per hour. 

Table 15 shows the items of cost included in keeping workstock 
for one year. Feed amounted to $88 per head which was 78.1 percent 



28 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



of total costs. Two thousand seventy-six pounds of concentrates, 
principally corn, were fed per head at a cost of $52. Roughage fed 
per head amounted to 2,263 pounds valued at $30. Pasture was 
charged at actual cost or $6.47 per head. Man labor to care for one 
head of workstock for a year was 35.8 hours, which cost $9.89. Costs 
other than feed and man labor amounted to $14.95. A manure credit 
of $7.50 per head was deducted from total gross costs per head of 
$113, which resulted in a net cost of $106 to keep one head of work- 
stock for a year. 

Since workstock worked only 46 days per head during the year, * 
some attention should be given to utilizing workstock labor more 
efficiently.

Factors That Affect Costs and Returns 
Size of Business 

Size is an important factor that affects all business enterprise 
and particularly is this true of farming. Farm income and the family- 
standard of living are largely determined by this factor. The size of 
a farm business can be measured in several v^ays. Number of acres 
operated, capital investment, crop acres, amount of labor used, num- 
ber of units comprising the major enterprises such as acres of cotton, 
number of milk cows in the herd, are measures commonly used. The 
more desirable measure to use in determining the size of a farm 
business depends a great deal on the type of farming followed. 

Some of the measures used to show the size of the 40 farm busi- 
nesses are shown in table 16. Acres per farm for all farms averaged 
170, with a total investment of $10,743. Cotton-dairy farms had 
more total acres, cotton acres, crop acres, and a larger investment than 
the dairy-cotton or dairy & cotton farms. This could be expected 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 29 



since emphasis was placed on cropping. As a whole, cotton-dairy 
businesses were the largest, dairy-cotton farms next, and the dairy 
& cotton farms the smallest. 

When considering the size of business in the Northeast Prairie, 
Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc Ridge Soil Areas, it will be noticed 
that the Prairie farms ranked highest in all measures. (Table 16). 
The Northeast Highland Area was next in all measures and the 
Pontotoc Ridge Area was the lowest in all measures.

Man work units. ^ Since man labor is a common denominator of 
all farms, table 17 was constructed to show the relation of man work 
units per farm to and among other important factors. As the man 
work units per farm increased, the number of cows increased, acres 
of cotton increased very pronouncedly, and labor income increased. 
Costs and returns and the efficiency in the use of labor are not shown 
in this table because the averages for these important casual factors 
were found to be significantly different for the three types of farm- 
ing; namely, dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton. 

Number of cotvs. When considering the relation of the number 
of milk cows per farm to production, costs and returns, the relation- 
ships were not altogether consistent. (See table 18.) The five smallest 
herds had the highest production per cow, the lowest cost per 100 
pounds of milk, and the highest return per hour of labor. However, 
it should be pointed out that after getting away from these small 
herds, man hours per cow did decrease, and the labor return per hour 
spent on cows increased, as the number of milk cows in the herd in- 
creased.

The same relationship was obtained when all 40 of the farms 
were likewise considered. A larger number of cases would no doubt 
show a more direct relationship between the size of herd and other 
important factors. 

Acres of cotton. Acres of cotton per farm varied considerably. 
(See table 19.) 

Labor requirements increased per 500-pound bale produced as 
the acres of cotton per farm increased on farms that grew more than 
10 acres. Under increasing mechanization conditions the reverse 
of this relationship would be expected. However, practically all of 
the cotton production on the 32 farms was performed by man and 
horse labor. Thus it would appear that labor is being used less ef- 
ficiently on the larger farms. The same relationship exists when 
considering cotton-dairy farms alone. 

Larger farms have more cropper tenants, and according to data 
presented in table 19, such labor is not as efficient as the labor 
furnished by the operator, members of his family, and the small 
amount of labor hired during the year on the smaller farms. Labor 
income increases as the size of the cotton enterprise increases, but 
labor income does not necessarily reflect efficient use of cropper 
labor on farms when considering the size of the business.

Labor Efficiency 

Using labor to the best advantage is one of the most important 
problems with which farm operators deal. Labor requirements are 
much greater for some enterprises than for others, and at the same 
time, the demands on all farms for labor is highly seasonal, particular- 
ly for crops. Labor requirements for crops constitute the largest 
cost item in their production. For cotton, this cost amounts to 60.5 
percent of the total expenses of growing the crop. Labor require- 
ments for corn, hay, and other crops were somewhat less, but still 
were the highest single cost item. 

Work units per man available on farms. The amount of labor

accomplished per man varied from farm to farm, and as the available 
man equivalent per farm increased, the units worked per man avail- 
able decreased. (See table 20.) Also, as the available man equivalent 
per farm increased, the acres of cropland per farm increased. Farms 
with an average of 38 acres of cropland had an average of 1.63 man 
equivalent of labor available. 

Since the amount of work accomplished per man available for 
work on the farm decreased as the size of business (measured by crop 
acres) increased, farmers operating large acreages should give more 
attention to using more efficiently the labor they have available under 
their management. It will be noticed that the acres of cropland per 
man did not vary much whether on a small farm or a large farm, yet 
the cost to produce an acre of cotton, or a pound of cotton, was greater 
as the size of farm business increased, and as the labor performed 
per man available decreased. The fact that larger farms had the 
most tenants, and since it was on .these farms that labor was used less 
efficiently, this would tend to explain the unfavorable relationship of 
cropland per man and the greater cost of producing cotton on the 
larger farms. 

Man hours per cow. The amount of labor used per cow ranged 
from 86 hours to 262 hours, and the average amount of man labor 
per cow was 145 hours for the 40 farms. (See table 21.) There was 
practically no relationship between hours used per cow and the amount 
of milk produced per cow. However, as man hours expended per cow, 
increased, the cost to produce 100 pounds of milk increased, and the 
labor return per hour decreased. Thus the labor used per cow should 
be kept at a minimum in keeping with the ability of the cow to pro- 
duce milk. While feed is the most expensive cost item in the produc- 
tion of milk, the labor cost ranks next and much careful attention 
should be given to its use.

1/ Man work units accomplished per man available was determined by dividing 
the total hours of productive work accomplished per farm by the man equivalent of 
labor found on the farm. The operator and man cropper tenants were considered 
as one man each available for 12 months of work. Family labor of the operator 
and family labor of the man cropper were converted" to the equivalent of man labor.

Man hours per acre of cotton. The labor used per acre of cotton 
varied very much also. (See table 22.) Seven farms averaged only 
77 man hours per acre while a like number of farms averaged 168 
hours. As the man hours per acre increased, the pounds of cotton 
produced per acre increased, which was unlike the relationship of 
labor expended per cow and the milk produced per cow. However, 
as the pounds of cotton per acre and labor per acre increased, the cost 
to produce an acre of cotton increased. Unlike the application of 
labor to cows, as labor on cotton per acre increased, the cost to pro- 
duce one pound of lint decreased and the labor return per hour in- 
creased up to 150 hours per acre and then decreased. Consequently, 
a farmer should be very careful about increasing the hours of labor 
used per cow and the labor used per acre of cotton above 150 hours 
under conditions similar to those on the 40 farms in Northeast Mis- 
sissippi. The part of his total time as operator of the farm that 
should be devoted to the entire dairy enterprise is another problem 
and should be considered in the organization of the entire farm 
business.

Rates of Production 

Again the reader might be reminded that the 40 farms keeping 
records in 1944 were divided into three groups or types: (1) dairy- 
cotton farms where there was a relatively high number of milk cows 
per farm compared with acres in cotton ; (2) cotton-dairy farms where 
the reverse of (1) above was true; and (3) dairy & cotton farms 
where the number of milk cows and acres in cotton per farm were 
about the same. 

Types of farming and rates of production. In table 23 the types 
of farms were listed according to the pounds of milk produced per 
cow. Farms placing the most emphasis on cotton (cotton-dairy 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 33 



farms) kept cows which had the lowest production, or 3,400 pounds 
each. Farms where major emphasis was placed on the dairy enter- 
prise (dairy-cotton farms) kept cows that produced an average of 
4,000 pounds each. And farms which placed about the same empha- 
sis on both dairy and cotton enterprises kept milk cows that produced 
an average of 4,400 pounds of milk each.

There was little relationship between the amount of milk produced 
per cow and the size of herd or the amount of concentrates fed per 
cow. Roughages fed per cow decreased as milk production increased 
and labor used per cow followed the same trend. It will be noticed 
.that where there was a balance between number of cows and acres of 
cotton per farm that labor per cow was the lowest and milk production 
per cow was the highest. This made for more profitable milk pro- 
duction as shown in table 24.

The cost to keep a cow for one year decreased by types of farming 
as the production per cow increased among the types. (See table 24.) 
Cost per cow was $148 on cotton-dairy farms, $138 on dairy-cotton 
farms, and $133 on dairy & cotton farms. Cost of producing 100 
pounds of milk on dairy & cotton farms was the lowest, amounting 
to $2.83. The cost on dairy-cotton and cotton-dairy farms per 100 
pounds of milk was $3.27 and $4.09, respectively. Farmers who 
placed major emphasis on producing cotton and minor emphasis on 
producing miik lost an average of $7 per cow. Dairy-cotton farms 
made a profit of $36 per cow, and dairy & cotton farmers made $42 
on each cow kept. Likewise, the return per hour for labor used on 
milk cows was highest on dairy & cotton farms, amounting to $0.61. 
Labor return per hour for this enterprise on dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy farms was $0.47 and $0.22, respectively. 

Milk per cow. A study of the dairy enterprise on farms in 
Northeast Mississippi finds, as in similar studies elsewhere, that low 



34 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



producing cows are not profitable and that as production per cow 
increases, profits per cow increase. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk per year showed 
a loss of $15.75 per year, whereas cows producing an average of 5,438 
pounds netted the farmer $44. (See table 25.) Only four farms had 
cows producing below 3,000 pounds. The yearly cost to keep a cow 
increased as the amount of milk per cow increased. (See table 26.) 
It cost $124 per year to keep a cow producing an average of 2,575 
pounds, and it cost $175 to keep a cow that averaged 5,438 pounds. 
Thus the cost to produce approximately an extra 3,000 pounds of 
milk above the average production of the low producing cows was $51. 
That is the same as stating that farmers who kept cows that produced 
above 5,000 pounds, produced the last 3,000 pounds of milk at a cost 
of $1.70 per hundred.

Feed costs per cow increased as production increased, and the 
cost to produce 100 pounds of milk decreased. Profit per cow in- 
creased as production per cow increased. The cost to produce milk 
with a cow producing 5,000 pounds was 31 percent less than with a 
cow producing 2,500 pounds, and the labor return per cow was 500 
percent greater for 5,500-pounds production cows.

Concentrates fed per cow increased as production increased. 
Likewise, the cost to keep a cow for one year increased. There was 
no relationship between production per cow and man hours used 
per cow. 

Cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $4.51 for farmers having 
cows that produced 2,575 pounds annually. Whereas, the cost was 
$3.11 per 100 pounds on farms having cows that averaged 5,438 
pounds. Labor returns per hour spent on milk cows increased as the 
milk produced per cow increased. Again, it might be pointed out 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 35 



that though the farmers with the lowest producing cows made a minor 
profit per cow, they had a labor return of $14 per cow. Assuming 
the farmer could not use his labor more profitably on some other en- 
terprise, and though his cows were low producers, his cows did pay 
all expenses other than labor and gave the farmer a return of $14 
per head as part payment for the labor he spent on them during the 
year. Labor return per cow was $85 where cows averaged producing 
above 5,000 pounds of milk. 

Milk per coiv by types of farming. The highest producing cows 
were not found on farms that placed major emphasis on keeping milk 
cows, but were found on the dairy & cotton type of farm. (See table 
27.) Concentrates fed per cow producing milk at various levels varied 
considerably among the three types of farms. However, the general 
trend was an increase in the feeding of concentrates per cow as the 
production increased. There was less relationship of this trend, 
among cotton-dairy farms. 

It will be noticed that on cotton-dairy farms it was only when 
milk production reached, the 5,000-pound mark that these farmers 
received a profit per cow. The cost of 100 pounds of milk increased 
as production per cow increased for dairy & cotton farms, which is 
inconsistent with each of the other types of farms and when all 40 
farms are likewise considered. This may be due to the feeding of 
considerably more concentrates to the cows producing above the 
3,000-pound level on the dairy & cotton farms. Also, it is quite 
possible for the cost to produce 100 pounds of milk to increase as 
production increased, but at a lesser rate and thereby show a favor- 
able return.

Pounds of cotton per acre. The production of cotton per acre 
ranged from 196 pounds to 837 when considering all farms. Seventy- 
five percent of all farms growing cotton had an average yield above 
400 pounds per acre and 44 percent of the farms producing cotton had 
a yield above 500 pounds. (See table 28.) 



As production per acre increased, man hours and total cost per 
acre increased. Likewise, profit per acre and labor return per hour 
increased. The farmers who produced above 770 pounds per acre 
received nearly one dollar per hour for their labor used on cotton.

Pounds of cotton per acre by types of farming. All types of 
farming showed an increase in man hours required per acre, total 
costs per acre, and profit per acre as the pounds of cotton produced 
per acre increased. (See table 29.) It was previously pointed out 
that man labor was the greatest cost item in the production of cotton 
amounting to 60 percent of total costs. This cost is shown by types 
of farming as related to pounds of cotton per acre for land, man labor 
and other factors. 



Where there was much emphasis placed on producing cotton 
(cotton-dairy farms), both land and labor costs increased as produc- 
tion increased up to where the average production was 604 pounds 
per acre, and then decreased as production went higher. This re- 
lationship was not obtained for the other types of farms. A larger 
number of cases might have given the same relationship. The lack 
of a sufficient number of farms in each class interval or grouping, 
should be considered before attempts are made to draw conclusions. 

The total cost to produce one pound of lint cotton on dairy & 
cotton farms decreased rather definitely as the yield per acre in- 
creased. This trend was not as consistent on the other two types of 
farms. The relation between increased yields per acre and labor 
returns per hour spent on cotton was fairly direct.

Dairy-cotton farmers received less for their labor when using it 
on cotton than did cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton farms. Low 
yields were partially responsible for this. Dairy & cotton farms re- 
ceived a labor return of 81 cents; cotton-dairy farms, 61 cents; and 
dairy-cotton farms, 49 cents for each hour spent in producing cotton. 
It should be noticed that the return per hour for labor used producing 
cotton was greater for those farms where there was a fairly well 
balanced emphasis on dairying and cotton. Likewise, this type of 
farming produced cotton at the lowest cost and received the highest 
profit per acre of cotton raised. 

Types of Farming 

The yield of cotton per acre varied considerably on the 32 farms 
producing it. Table 30 shows this variation by types of farming. 
Cotton-dairy farms grew four times the acreage of cotton as was 
grown on dairy-cotton farms and a little more than three times the 
amount grown on dairy & cotton farms. The yield per acre was 
slightly more than a bale per acre on both cotton-dairy and dairy & 
cotton farms, whereas the yield was only two-thirds bale per acre on 
dairy-cotton farms.

The cost of producing a pound of cotton varied little between 
types of farms, but varied considerably between individual farms. 
The cost per pound on dairy-cotton and cotton-dairy farms was 13.3 
and 13.5 cents, respectively. The cost to produce a pound of cotton 
on dairy & cotton farms was 12.4 cents, or one cent less than for the 
other farm types. The range in cost to produce a pound of cotton 
on the 32 farms was from 6.67 cents to 21.16 cents. Seventy-five 
percent of the farms produced cotton at a cost range from 10 to 16 
cents per pound with an average cost of 13.3 cents for all farms. 

Labor returns per hour spent on cotton averaged 63 cents for the 
32 farms. Low yields per acre undoubtedly account for the low labor 
return on dairy-cotton farms. On the other hand, yields were ap- 
proximately the same for cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton farms. 
Yet, the returns per hour of labor on dairy & cotton farms was 33 
percent higher than on dairy-cotton farms. This difference was due 
largely to the fact that the cotton-dairy farms used 31 hours more 
labor per acre, or 26 percent more than was used by dairy & cotton 
farms. 

Combination of Enterprises 

The combination of crops and animal enterprises for 39 farms 
and for the three types of farming in Northeast Mississippi are shown 
in table 31. The most important crop enterprises were cotton, corn, 
and hay. Corn and hay were grown for livestock feed. Hay was 
a cash crop on two farms. 

Cotton and milk cows are the major income enterprises on farms 
in Northeast Mississippi, and anything affecting these two enterprises 
plays an important role in determining the well-being of farmers in 
this area. The most profitable combination of cotton and milk cows 
and contributing enterprises constitutes a question that has not been 
satisfactorily answered in the area under study. 

Generally, a farmer receives the most of his income from the 
farm enterprise on which he spends the most of his labor. The 
average farm had 14.2 milk cows on which 205 ten-hour days of pro- 
ductive work were spent. Also, farms producing cotton had an 
average of 21.8 acres in that crop on which 307 ten-hour days of 
productive work were spent. Thus 49 percent more labor was used 
on the cotton enterprise than on the dairy enterprise for all farms.

iCrop acres include double cropped acres. 



All farms produced milk for the market. Only 32 farms pro- 
duced cotton. Therefore, for eight farms, the sale of milk was the 
only source of cash income except for miscellaneous sales of surplus 
stock, eggs and feed, which contributed considerably to labor income 
on some farms. All of the farms sold surplus livestock such as calves 
and heifers, eggs, hens, hogs, and a few sold some hay and corn. 
Labor income for eight farms in the dairy-cotton farm group not 
producing cotton was 73 percent of average labor income for the entire 
group of dairy-cotton farms. In other words, farms including cotton 
in their farm program along with milk cows in this type of farming 
had a larger labor income. However, profit per herd on the eight 
farms depending on cows for their cash income was $883, or 33 
percent above the average herd profit of $665 for dairy-cotton farms ; 
and more than twice as much profit per herd as for the 40 farms, 
which was $370. 

Type of farming related to enterprise profits. Farms placing 
major emphasis on cotton lost $7 per cow annually and $89 per herd. 
But they made a profit of $38 per acre on cotton and a profit of $1,516 
on the cotton enterprise. (See table 32.) Farms placing about the 
same emphasis on both milk cows and cotton received the greatest 
return per cow and per acre of cotton. Labor income was slightly 
higher than for the other types of farming — dairy-cotton and cotton- 
dairy. Since the dairy & cotton farms were slightly smaller than 
dairy-cotton farms, and only about 50 percent as large as cotton-dairy 
farms, it appears that much attention should be given to the desir- 
ability of organizing farms so that major emphasis is placed on both 
the cotton and dairy enterprises in the area of this study.

Weather conditions were very favorable in Northeast Mississippi 
to cotton production in 1944 and only fair for feed crops and pastures. 
These conditions should be considered when making an appraisal of 
the results of this report. The fact that cotton-dairy farms with a 
larger investment did not make a larger labor income was due to the 
loss they sustained on their dairy herds and to using farm labor less 
efficiently. 



Combination of enterprises on high and lotv income farms. A 
comparison of enterprises on farms found in the upper one-third labor 
income group ($2,444) and the lowest one-third labor income group 
($416) of the farms under study is also given in table 31. Crop acres 
were 85.7 for the upper income group and 47.2 acres for the low in- 
come group with an average of 61.3 acres for all farms. Thus, the 
size of business looms up as an important factor affecting income. 
Cotton acreage in the upper one-third income group was more than 
twice as great as in the lowest one-third income group, whereas milk 
cows were only three less in the low income group than in the upper 
income group. Forty-one percent of the crop acreage on the low 
income farms was in hay and 27 percent was in hay on the upper 
income group. 

Combination of enterprises on high and loiv cost farms. The 
combination of enterprises on farms producing cotton and milk at 
the highest and lowest costs per pound of lint and per 100 pounds of 
milk are shown in table 33. The 10 farms producing cotton at the 
lowest cost, or 9.44 cents per pound, had 14.3 acres in cotton, and the 
10 high-cost farms — 16.99 cents per pound — ^had 16.3 acres in cotton. 
The difference in acreage was not significant. However, acres of 
cotton produced on the highest-milk-cost farms ($4.51 per 100 
pounds) were twice as many as were found on the 10 farms produc- 
ing milk at the lowest cost, or at $2.30 per 100 pounds. 

The difference in the emphasis placed on milk cows and other 
livestock on high and low cost farms for both cows and cotton (table 
33) was of little significance, which means that the difference in milk 
costs due to other factors such as the capacity of cow, feeding 
practices, time of calving, pasture per cow, efficient use of labor, and 
emphasis placed on other enterprises. The fact that the 9 farms 
producing milk at the highest cost had twice the acreage of cotton 
as was found on the 10 farms producing milk at the lowest cost, bears 
out earlier findings that milk was produced less efficiently on farms 
giving major emphasis to cotton.

The number of milk cows on the 10 farms producing cotton at the 
lowest cost and the 10 farms producing cotton at the highest cost 
were practically the same. Likewise, acres per farm in cotton were 
about the same. However, the 10 farms producing cotton at the 
lowest cost, produced an average of 114 pounds per acre more than 
on the 10 farms producing cotton at the highest cost. The farms 
producing cotton at the lowest cost kept cows that produced more 
milk by 370 pounds than was the production per cow on farms produc- 
ing cotton at the highest cost. 

The 10 farms producing milk at the lowest cost kept cows that 
averaged 4,470 pounds of milk each, whereas the average production 
per cow on the 9 highest cost farms was 3,811 pounds — an annual 
difference of 659 pounds. On the other hand, the yield of cotton was 
greatest per acre on farms with the highest milk production costs. 
This again points out the fact that milk was produced less efficiently 
on farms placing the most emphasis on cotton. Also, it has been 
shown that labor is used less efficiently on farms with a large acreage 
of cotton. 

Soil Fertility 

Detail soil maps for each of the 40 farms in this study were 
furnished by the Soil Conservation Service of Mississippi and the 
Bureau of Plant Industry. These maps were used to study in detail 
the soil types on each farm. A staff member of the Experiment 
Station Soils Department assisted in this work by making a visit to 
each farm to study the types of soils with special emphasis on the 
fertility and adaptability of crops to the soils on which they were 
being grown. Farms were then classed as high, medium, and low 
in fertility for the purpose of finding relationships between farms of 
different fertility levels and the costs of production and income. 



42 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Soil fertility related to costs and returns. Half of the farms in 
the Black Prairie Area were classed high in fertility. One-half of 
the farms in the Northeast Highland Area were low in fertility, and 
85 percent of the farms in the Pontotoc Ridge Area also were classed 
low in fertility. 

For the areas as a whole, the cost to produce one pound of cotton 
increased as soil fertility decreased. (See table 34.) The difference 
in costs between farms of high fertility and low fertility was ap- 
proximately two cents per pound. With a market price of 20 cents 
for cotton, a spread of 2 cents per pound amounts to $10 per bale. 
Interest at 5 percent on an investment of $200 amounts to $10. Con- 
sequently, a farmer can afford to pay considerably more for land of 
high fertility when purchasing land for the purpose of growing 
cotton. The rate of cotton production was greater on farms of high 
soil fertility, as would be expected. This, of course, was a major 
factor in influencing the smaller cost of producing a pound of cotton 
on these farms.

Soil fertility related to various factors. The foregoing soil 
fertility cost relationship for the 32 farms were the same for the Black 
Prairie Area except that the difference between cost of producing a 
pound of cotton on high and low fertility farms was greater. (See 
table 35.) In the Pontotoc Ridge and Northeast Highland Areas, the 
same general relationship existed. However, the value of these find- 
ings is limited by the few farms in this study located in the Northeast 
Highland Area and in the better grades of land in the Pontotoc 
Ridge Area.

FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 43 



Farms high in fertility produced an average of 508 pounds of lint 
cotton per acre, but both medium and low fertility farms produced 
well above 400 pounds per acre. (See table 36.) 

Profit per acre of cotton decreased as soil fertility decreased. 
Farms of low fertility spent more for fertilizer per acre than did 
farms of medium fertility, yet received less profit per acre. Labor 
income was inconsistent in its relationship to soil fertility; however, 
labor income on farms of low fertility was much less than labor in- 
come on farms of medium and high fertility.

Soil Crop Adaptation 

Growing a crop on the type of soil to which it is best adapted 
usually gives the highest labor returns. Progressive farm operators 
give much thought to placing crops in their farm layouts so that this 
relationship exists. Table 37 shows the relationship of the adaptation 
of crops to soils on the 40 farms in this study. On 22 farms the 
adaptation of crops to soils on which they were grown was **good" ; 
on 14 farms, "fair" ; and on 4 farms it was "poor". The adaptation 
of crops to soils on the farm as a whole was used as a basis for the 
above classification.

The rate of production was highest where soil crop adaptation 
was good. It cost 12.42 cents to produce a pound of lint cotton where 
adaptation was good, 15.05 cents where it was fair, and 15.17 cents 
where adaptation was poor. The cost to produce a bushel of corn 
was 94 cents where soil crop adaptation was good, $1.10 where it was 
fair, and $1.41 where soil crop adaptation was poor. The cost of 
producing cotton per pound was 23 percent greater on farms with poor 
soil crop adaptation than on farms when the soil crop adaptation was 
good. It cost 50 percent more to produce corn on farms where the 
soil crop adaptation was poor than where the soil crop adaptation 
was good. Also, it will be observed that labor return per hour spent 
on cotton was 73 cents where soil crop adaptation was good, 61 cents

where it was fair, and 54 cents on farms where it was poor. Labor 
income was highest on farms where soil crop adaptation was good 
and lowest on farms with poor soil crop adaptation. 

Milk Production by Seasons 

Seasonal fluctuation of the production of milk was trciTi^ndously 
great on a large majority of the farms. This variation in the amount 
of milk produced per cow from season to season, or from winter to 
summer, is due primarily to the seasonality of pasture production and 
breeding practices as well as to feeding practices. Since few farmers 
grow winter pastures and with many feeding lightly in the winter, 
milk production is piled up from April to September. In fact, 64 
percent of the milk produced by 571 cows on 40 farms was produced 
from April to September, or in just 50 percent of the year. Figure 2 
shows the monthly trend of total milk sold on the 40 farms as well 
as the trend for the monthly butterfat test. 

This great fluctuation in milk production during the year affects 
very little the efficient operation of the farm business as they are now 
organized, since the labor spent on a cow varies only a small amount 
from season to season. On the other hand, milk processing plants 
are faced with a very difficult problem. Since their equipment, 
which represents a relatively large investment, is used only for pro- 
cessing whole milk, these plants are forced to carry equipment and 
labor necessary for capacity production for less than 6 months during 
the year and then operate much under capacity for a large portion of 
the year. Should the milk plants in the area shut down during their 
slack season, there would be no market outlet for farmers producing 
milk, which would be disastrous to the dairy business. Yet most 
dairy farmers permit their cows to virtually shut down in production 
during the winter months and expect milk plants running at one- 
fourth capacity or less to continue operation. 

Seasonal production related to costs and returns. Thirteen 
farms milked cows that produced for sale during the months of Janu- 
ary, February, and March, only 146 pounds each per month. (See 
table 38.) That was less than 1/2 gallon daily per cow. For the 40 
farms as a whole, the average daily amount sold per cow in the months 
of January, February, and March was only 7.3 pounds of milk. That 
was less than 1 gallon per day. Cows producing above 5,000 pounds 
for sale during the year averaged 11.6 pounds of milk per day in the 
first quarter of the year and reached a production of slightly less 
than 2 gallons per day in the months of July, August, and September

— their highest producing quarter. Milk sold per cow, on the aver- j 
age, was 1.3 pounds per day less than was produced. This amount 
was consumed by the family or by calves. Cows producing less than 
5,000 pounds of milk sold per year reached their peak of daily produc- 
tion in the second quarter of the year. 

Figure 3 shows the trend of milk sold monthly per cow in each 
of the quarters of the year, as well as the labor return per hour for. 
labor used on milk cows. Increase in production for the second 
quarter of the year was rather abrupt. The increase for cows pro- 
ducing below 3,000 pounds sold annually was approximately 90 per- 
cent, and over 100 percent for cows producing from 3 to 4 thousand 
pounds. This increase in the springtime was not as great for cows 
above the 4,000-pound mark. It is shown further that production 
per cow declined gradually from the second quarter to the third 
quarter, except when more than 5,000 pounds were sold per cow, and 
then dropped precipitously in the fourth quarter, reversing the move- 
ment in the spring months. 

Figure 2 shows the monthly trend of total milk sold on the 40 
farms as well as the trend for the monthly percent butterfat test. 
This monthly trend of milk sold coincides closely with pasture con- 
ditions. It should be noticed that cows producing from 340 to 350 
pounds of salable milk monthly in January, February, and March, 
which is approximately 1.3 gallons per day, gave a labor return of 
more than twice as much per hour as was given by cows producing 
an average of 146 pounds per month. 

Cows producing below 3,000 pounds of market milk per year 
and dropping very low in winter production, produced milk at a cost 
of $3.88 per 100 pounds with a labor return of $0.25 per hour. Cows 
producing from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of market milk annually pro- 
duced it at a cost of $3.41 per 100 pounds and gave a labor return 
of $0.58 cents per hour. 

Fcrrm Practices 

Practices followed by farmers in operating their businesses are 
very important in the effect upon costs and income and the profitable- 
ness of the farm as a whole. Farmers often follow different practices 
and get practically the same results. If the results are good, then 
both practices may be good under the given conditions. However, 
if farmers are using poor practices, results obtained very seldom give 
pleasure and profit in the business. 

^ Practices followed in feeding cows varied from farm to farm 
giving varying results. Records of these methods of feeding show 
that the combination of feeds and the capacity of cows to convert feed 
materials into milk play a greater part in profitable milk production 
than do mere quantities of feed. A few farmers feed for winter 
production and may feed to keep their cows alive until spring grass 
comes. Others feed for winter production and then practically quit 
feeding when the cows begin to get a few nibbles of grass in the spring. 
A few dairymen are beginning to provide winter grazing by planting 
oats, or other winter crops. All indications point to the need for a 11 
more detailed study of feeding practices by dairymen under actual 
farm conditions.

Producing milk for the winter market Farmers milking cows 
that have a relatively high production in the winter when compared 
with those having a low production in the winter months, produce 
milk more cheaply and receive the largest return per cow. Line 
graphs of monthly production per cow when production was low and 
when relatively high in winter months are shown in figure 4. 

Low winter producers had an average production of only 121 
pounds in January, or 4 pounds per day. Their production was 165 
and 158 pounds, respectively, for November and December, and 160 
pounds for February. Their peak production of 425 pounds per 
month was reached in May. Production for low winter producers 
almost doubled in the 2-month period of September and October. 

When winter production was relatively high, the average produc- 
tion per cow for January was 392 pounds, or 13 pounds per day. 
Low winter producers gave less than gallon of milk per day, which 
indicates that the low producers were practically dry. 

The yearly per day cost of keeping the average cow on the five 
farms where production of milk was low in winter months was $0.29. 
The yearly per day market value of the milk produced on these same 
farms was 3.72 cents per pound. With a cow producing 4 pounds 
per day, the daily value of milk per cow was 14.88 cents. Thus the 
average cow on the five farms where winter production was low was 
kept at a loss of about 15 cents per day during January. The loss 
per day would have been greater if the daily cost had been determined 
for the month of January. This unfavorable situation continued 
through February and on into the spring months until production 
increased sufficiently to equal cost of production. In the fall months, 
production dropped to the point where daily costs per cow for the 
months of October, November, and December were greater than the 
daily value of milk produced. 

On the other hand, the yearly per day cost to keep the average 
cow on the five farms where production of milk was relatively high 
per cow in the winter months was 39.7 cents. The yearly per day 
market value of the milk produced on those same farms was 3.85 
cents per pound, and with a cow producing 13 pounds of milk per day 
in January, the daily value of milk produced was 50.1 cents. There- 
fore, the average cow on the five farms where winter milk production

Milk production per month for 571 cows increased 117 percent from January to 
May and decreased 50 per cent from July to November. This fluctuation in milk 
makes it very difficult for milk plants to operate efficiently throughout the year. 
Also, it creates a problem for milk truckmen. Since more winter production usually 
results in higher profit per cow, farmers need to consider more seriously the prob- 
lem of seasonal production. 



50 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



was relatively high was kept at a gain of 10.4 cents per day. This- 
gain was above all costs including labor. 

On farms where winter production per cow was low, the amount 
of milk produced per cow during the year was 1,733 pounds less than 
the amount produced by cows relatively high in winter production. 
(Figure 3.) Concentrates fed per cow were considerably less on the 
low-winter production farms. They did feed, however, a little more 
roughage per cow than was fed on high winter production farms. 
Profit per cow was three times greater and labor returns per hour 
used on cows was twice as great on farms where winter production 
per cow was relatively high. Also, the cost to produce 100 pounds of 
milk was 53 cents less on those farms. The foregoing shows that it 
was much more profitable to keep cows producing relatively high in 
the winter months as well as during summer. 

Cotton production with and tvithout sharecroppers. Thirty-two 
of the 40 farms on which records were kept produced cotton. Eight 
of these farms did not have sharecroppers. The work was done by 
the operator and members of the family, by swapping labor with 
neighbors, and by hiring a small amount of cash labor in rush periods. 

Farms with sharecroppers produced nearly four times as many 
acres of cotton as were produced by farms without sharecroppers. 
(See table 40.) The cost to produce one acre of cotton was greater 
where sharecroppers were used, but this was due principally to the 
high cost of labor which was paid with one-half of the cotton crop and 
to less efficient use of this labor on the larger farms. 1944 was a 
very favorable year for producing cotton in Northeast Mississippi, 
and the half of the cotton crop going to the tenant as payment for his 
labor explains to a large extent the difference in cost per acre. Labor 
on farms without croppers was valued at the current rate paid labor 
without lodging and meals.

Labor returns per hour spent on cotton for sharecropper farms 
were slightly above the labor returns on farms where there were no 
sharecroppers. The larger yield on farms with sharecroppers con- 
tributed to this difference. Farms with sharecroppers had soils 
with higher fertility and better soil-crop adaptation, all of which was 
a contributing factor affecting labor returns. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 51 

Summary 

This study was based on farm records kept by 40 farmers in 5 
counties of Northeast Mississippi for the year 1944. Farms were 
selected in the Black Prairie, Northeast Highland, and Pontotoc 
Ridge soil areas, and were further selected on the basis of emphasis 
placed on milk cows and cotton. 

The average acreage per farm was 170 with cropland amounting 
to 44 percent. Open, tillable pasture amounted to 25 percent of all 
land, and open non-tillable land represented 12 percent. 

Milk cows were the most numerous livestock on the average farm 
with 14 head each. The range in number was from 4 to 40. 

The average investment per farm was $10,743. Total real estate 
investment amounted to $38 per acre and livestock, equipment, feeds, 
and miscellaneous supplies amounted to $25.20, which gave a total 
farm investment of $63.20 per acre. Average farm receipts amount- 
ed to $5,930 ; farm expenses were $3,973, and the average labor income 
was $1,420 per farm. 

Milk was produced for sale on all farms. There was an average 
of 14 milk cows per farm with an annual production each of 3,931 
pounds. The feed cost was 59.6 percent of the total cost of producing 
100 pounds of milk. Man labor amounted to 27.3 percent. The net 
farm cost to keep a cow for one year was $120.98, and the net farm 
cost to produce 100 pounds of milk was $3.08. With an average 
hauling charge of 25 cents per 100 pounds, the cost of 100 pounds 
delivered at the plant was $3.33. 

The cost of producing milk delivered at the plant on dairy-cotton, 
cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton farms was $3.27, $4.09, and $2.83, 
respectively. Similarly the profit per cow was $36, — $7, and $42. 
The average cost to keep a cow for 1 year on dairy-cotton farms was 
$120 ; on cotton-dairy farms, $130 ; and $113 on dairy & cotton farms. 
(Price received at plant.) It will be noticed that costs were least and 
labor returns were highest on dairy & cotton farms. 

Thirty-two farms produced cotton averaging 21.8 acres and 20.2 
bales ginned per farm. The average price received per pound of 
lint cotton was 21.21 cents, and the cost to produce one pound of lint 
was 13.28 cents. Man labor constituted 60.5 percent of the total 
cost to produce 1 pound of lint. An average of 141 hours of man 
labor was required on the 32 farms to grow 1 acre of cotton. On 
dairy-cotton farms, 112 hours of man labor were required to produce 
1 acre of cotton. On cotton-dairy farms, 151 hours were required, 
and dairy & cotton farms required 120 hours. The cost to produce 
a pound of lint cotton on dairy-cotton, cotton-dairy, and dairy & cotton 
farms was 13.31 cents, 13.55 cents, and 12.42 cents, respectively. 

The cost to produce a bushel of corn was 95.5 cents ; 100 pounds 
of live pork, $12.41 ; and the cost to keep one head of workstock for 
a year was $105.82. 



52 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Cotton-dairy farms had more total acres, cotton acres, crop acres, 
and a larger investment than the dairy-cotton or dairy & cotton 
farms. Farms in the Black Prairie soil area ranked highest in all 
measures of size of farm business. The Northeast Highland came 
second and the Pontotoc Ridge Area was third. 

As the man work units per farm increased, the number of cows 
increased, acres of cotton increased, and labor income increased. 
Labor returns per hour of labor increased as the number of cows in 
the herd increased. In general, as the acres in cotton per farm 
increased, the man hours of labor required to produce one bale in- 
creased. This seems to be due to the fact that as the size of the farm 
increased, the number of sharecroppers per farm increased, which 
indicates that sharecropper labor was used less efficiently. Also, 
as the man equivalent available for work on the farms increased, the 
units worked per man decreased. With man labor constituting 60.5 
percent of the cost of producing a pound of lint cotton, the efficient 
use of labor is of vital importance. Labor requirements per cow 
were lowest on dairy & cotton farms. 

Cotton-dairy farms kept the lowest producing cows and dairy 
& cotton farms kept the highest producers. There was little relation- 
ship between the amount of milk produced per cow and the size of 
the herd. Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk per year 
showed a loss of $^5.75 per head, whereas cows producing above 5,000 
pounds netted the farmers $44 each. The average annual produc- 
tion per cow for the 40 farms was 3,931 pounds, and production per 
cow on dairy & cotton farms was 4,392 ; on dairy-cotton farms, 3,993 
pounds ; and on cotton-dairy farms, 3,413 pounds. Farmers keeping 
cows that produced above 5,000 pounds produced the last 3,000 pounds 
of milk at a cost of $1.70 per hundred when compared with production 
per cow of less than 3,000 pounds. Labor returns per hour spent 
on milk cows increased as the milk produced per cow increased, and 
the annual labor return per cow was $85 where production averaged 
above 5,000 pounds. 

The production of lint cotton per acre ranged from 196 pounds 
to 837 pounds. Seventy-five percent of the farms producing cotton 
had an average yield of about 400 pounds per acre, and 44 percent 
had a production above 500 pounds per acre. All types of farming 
showed an increase in man hours required per acre, total costs per 
acre, and profit per acre as the pounds of cotton produced per acre 
increased. The yield was slightly more than a bale per acre on both 
cotton-dairy and dairy & cotton, and only 2/3 bale per acre on dairy- 
cotton farms. 

The principal combination of farm enterprises on farms was 
cotton, milk cows, corn and hay. Cotton and milk cows were the 
major income enterprises. Farms placing major emphasis on cotton 
lost $7 per milk cow, but made a profit of $38 per acre on cotton. 
Farms placing about the same emphasis on both cotton and milk 
cows received the greatest return per cow and per acre of cotton. 
Farms producing milk at the highest cost produced twice the acreage 
of cotton that was produced on low cost farms. Variations in the 
proportionate combinations of enterprises on farms producing cotton 
and milk at a high cost and a low cost (table 33) was not significant. 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 53 



except for the difference in cotton acreage, which would indicate that 
differences in costs were due more to such factors as capacity of 
cows, feeding practices, pasture per cow, quality of seed, amount of 
fertilizer used, soil fertility, labor efficiency and the managerial 
ability of the farmer. 

The cost to produce one pound of cotton increased as soil fer- 
tility decreased. The cost relationship was the same for each of 
the soil areas. 

The rate of crop production was highest where soil-crop adapta- 
tion was good. The cost of producing cotton per pound was 23 per- 
cent greater on farms with poor soil-crop adaptation than on farms 
where soil-crop adaptation was good. It cost 50 percent more to 
produce corn on farms where the soil-crop adaptation was poor than 
where it was good; and labor income was highest on farms where 
soil-crop adaptation was good, and lowest on farms with poor soil-crop 
adaptation. 

Sixty-four percent of the milk produced by 571 cows on 40 farms 
was produced from April to September, inclusive, or in one-half of 
the year. The daily average amount of milk sold per cow in the 
months of January, February, and March was 7.3 pounds, or less 
than 1 gallon. Milk production per month for the 571 cows increased 
117 percent from January to May, and decreased 50 percent from 
July to November. Cows producing below 3,000 pounds of market 
milk per year, and dropping very low in winter production, produced 
milk at a cost of $3.88 per 100 pounds with a labor return of 25 cents 
per hour. Cows producing from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds of market 
milk annually produced at a cost of $3.41 per 100 pounds and gave 
a labor return of $0.58 per hour. 

On five farms where milk production was lowest per cow in 
January, the average amount produced daily by each cow was 4 
pounds — less than 1/2 gallon. These same cows reached their peak 
production of 14 pounds of milk per day or 1.6 gallons in May. On 
five farms where winter production was relatively high, the average 
daily production per cow in January was 13 pounds. Low winter 
producers were kept at a loss of 15 cents per day in January, and 
relatively high winter producing cows were kept at a gain of 10.4 
cents per day. Profit per cow was three times as great and labor re- 
turns per hour were twice as great, on farms where winter production 
per cow was relatively high. 

The cost to produce one acre of cotton was greater where share- 
croppers were used, but this was due principally to the high cost of 
labor which was paid with one-half of the cotton crop and to less 
efficient use of this labor available on the larger farms. 



54 MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 431 



Recommendations 

In summary, the findings of this study appear to suggest the 
following recommendations : 

Keep high producing coivs. Cows with a production below 3,000 
pounds gave an annual labor return of $14. On farms where produc- 
tion was above 5,000 pounds, the return was $85 per cow. 

Groiv cotton on soils of high fertility. The cost to produce cotton 
on farms of high soil fertility was 12.58 cents per pound, whereas the 
cost was 14.67 cents on farms of low soil fertility, or a cost spread of 
nearly 2 cents. This spread of cost between high and low fertility 
farms was nearly 4 cents per pound in the Black Prairie area. On 
land that produced between 700 and 800 pounds of lint per acre, the 
profit on each acre was $83. On land that produced between 200 and 
300 pounds of lint, the profit per acre was only $15. 

Use labor more efficiently. Cows on which 125 hours were 
spent gave a labor return of $0.56 per hour, and cows on which more 
than 200 hours were spent gave a labor return of only $0.18 per hour. 

The average cost to grow a pound of lint was 13.28 cents. Labor 
amounted to 8.04 cents of this cost, or 60.5 percent of the total cost to 
produce a pound of lint cotton. On farms where the average labor 
performed per man available was less than 100 days during the year, 
the man labor cost to produce 1 pound of lint cotton was 9.3 cents. 
Where the days of labor per man were 250 and above, the man labor 
cost was 5.2 cents per pound. 

Place major emphasis on both cotton and dairy enterprises. 
There is a definite place for both cotton and milk cows in the or- 
ganization of farms in Northeast Mississippi. This combination of 
enterprises permits more efficient use of labor and farm by-products, 
and cotton and dairy cows supplement each other by giving the farmer 
a higher return per hour for his labor. 

Labor return per hour spent on milk cows on dairy & cotton 
farms was $0.61. On dairy-cotton farms the returns were $0.47 
per hour and on cotton-dairy farms it was only $0.22 per hour. On 
dairy & cotton farms labor returns per hour spent on cotton was 
$0.81, whereas it was $0.49 and $0.61, respectively, on dairy-cotton 
and cotton-dairy farms. 

Groiv crops on soils to which they are best adapted. On farms 
where soil-crop adaptation was good, the cost to produce a pound of 
cotton was 12.42 cents, and the cost to produce a bushel of corn was 
$0.94. Where soil-crop adaptation was poor, the cost was 15.17 cents 
per pound for cotton and $1.41 per bushel of corn. 

Feed cows for winter production. Low winter producers gave 
a labor return of $0.35 per hour. Relatively high winter producers 
returned $0.72 per hour. 



Breed for winter production. Cow§ bred to calve in the late fall 



FARM MANAGEMENT ON 40 FARMS IN NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 55 



are available for their best flow of milk in the winter months as well 
as in the spring and early summer months. 

Reduce costs by increasing rates of production. Farms that 
produced cotton at the lowest cost had the highest yields, or 1.14 
five-hundred pound bales per acre, and farms producing cotton at 
the highest cost had the lowest yields or 0.78 five-hundred pound bale 
per acre. 

Cows producing less than 3,000 pounds of milk annually, pro- 
duced it at a cost of $4.51 per 100 pounds, and cows producing more 
than 5,000 pounds produced it at a cost of $3.11 per 100 pounds, or a 
difference of $1.40. 

Large farms should use available labor more fully. Days of 
work (10-hour days) per man on farms with more than three man 
equivalents available averaged less than 125 for the year. Days of 
work per man on farms with 1.6 man equivalents available averaged 
310. 

Keep only ivorkstock needed. The net cost to keep one head of 
workstock for a year was $106. 

Use workstock more efficiently. The average head of workstock 
was used only 46 ten-hour days during the year.

Some Factors Related to Food Preparation 

By DOROTHY DICKINS 

Head, Home Economics Department 



It is the purpose of this report to ex- 
amine some of the factors probably re- 
lated to family food preparation — factors 
such as family composition, schooling, 
and food and nutrition information of 
homemaker, economic status of family, 
family background of homemaker and 
male head, time expenditures in food 
preparation, scheduling of homemaker, 
type of menus served, equipment for 
food preparation, and arrangement of 
this equipment. It is important to learn 
more about these factors and how they 
are related to food preparation, for it 
is on the basis of such information that 
practical suggestions for improving prep- 
aration can be formulated. Better food 
preparation is one way of raising the 
level of living of a family. The food 
supply one has can be made more ade- 
quate by following the methods of prep- 
aration that conserve nutrients. A more 
adequate food supply will result in bet- 
ter health and better health in higher 
levels of living. 

Scope of Study 

This is part of a large study of food 
preparation of small town families of 
Mississippi. It includes 160 of the 
1,158 families in the larger study 
selected so that there were 16 or more 
families in each of eight groups: white 
families in the Delta and Shortleaf Pine 
Area towns with housing values of $20.00 
and under, and of |20.01 to $40.00; and 
Negro families in the Delta and Shortleaf 
Pine Area towns with housing values of 
$7.50 and under, and of $7.51 to $20.00. 
(By housing value is meant monthly rent 
or rental value of house or apartment 
unfurnished in which the family re- 
sides.)--'' Families with housing values 
of more than $40.00 were not included 
in this study, since there were too few 
of the 1,158 families to secure a large 
enough record sample. 



Data were obtained in the summer of 
1943 from records kept by homemakers 
and from schedules filled out by means 
of personal interviews with these women. 
White and Negro home economists su- 
pervised record keeping and secured oth- 
er information by interviewing the home- 
maker.-^ 

The homemakers were asked to keep 
a record of methods used in preparing 
12 foods served in the home during one 
week. (See Appendix for record forms 
used.) The foods for which the records 
were kept were limited to: (1) cooked 
vegetables, (2) meat, fish, poultry, or 
^ggs, (3) breads, and (4) vegetabk 
salads. The homemaker was asked to 
limit records of any one food, such as 
cornbread, string beans, to 3, unless va- 
riety of foods served in this period was 
so limited that more than 3 records of 
a food must be kept to yield 12 prepara- 
tion records. It was asked that records 
be kept of those foods ordinarily served 
when the food was in season and sug- 
gested that a good distribution would be 
six cooked vegetables, one vegetable salad 
(if served that often), and remaining 
five — breads, eggs, meat, fish, and poul- 
try — as the homemaker preferred. It 
was requested that no changes in meth- 
ods of preparation be made during the 
study. Measuring cups, spoons, and 
scales were furnished. 

Other records kept by the homemaker 
during the week of the study were of her 
own activities during each day, of assis-

tance in homemaking activities,-/ and of 
all foods served during this period. The 
supervisor obtained information from 
families in which records were kept con- 
cerning kind and condition of equipment 
for food preparation and concerning kit- 
chen arrangement. She also secured in- 
formation pertaining to family history of 
homemaker and male head that might 
throw some light on the food prepara- 
tion pattern of the family. Data con- 
cerning family composition, schooling, 
food and nutrition education, and eco- 
nomic status were secured in the initial 
study from which these families were 
selected. 

How Representative Arc the Families 

In the larger study, one or two general 
questions concerning the usual methods 
of preparation and/or serving 12 common 
foods had been obtained from each of the 
families. When the information obtain- 
ed from the larger group and from the 
record keeping group of the same race 
and housing value are compared, some- 
what better practices concerning prepara- 
tion and /or serving were found on the 
part of the record sample than of the 
entire group. This was much more true 
of Negro families than of white families. 
Keeping records, even when one has the 
help of a supervisor, is too difficult for 
women of little schooling and thus co- 
operation of the near-illiterate is definite- 
ly limited. Median school grade com- 
pleted by Negro homemakers in the larg- 
er study was the sixth, by record keeping 
Negro homemakers in this study, the 
eighth. Median grade completed by 
white homemakers in both groups was 
the twelfth. 

Also, it may be that there is more in- 
terest in keeping food preparation rec- 
ords on the part of those who have bet- 
ter practices. The fact that record keep- 
ers with the same schooling as non-rec- 
ord keepers reported, for example, some- 
what greater use of milk and eggs in 
cooking, more enriched flour, less drain- 



ing of canned beans, would indicate that 
record keeping may select those with 
somewhat better practices. 

Records of Food Preparation 

The 160 white and Negro homemakers 
in this study kept records of 1,857 of the 
dishes they served during the record 
week« The average number of prepara- 
tion records kept of the different types 
of food per family (i.e., vegetables, meat 
and eggs, breads, vegetable salads) is giv- 
en in table 1. As will be noted, white 
homemakers kept more lecords of vege- 
tables and of vegetable salads; Negro 
homemakers more of meat and eggs and 
of breads. Vegetables and vegetable sal- 
ads were more frequently served during 
the record week in homes of white fam- 
ilies; breads in homes of Negro families 
(table a in Appendix). Greater frequ- 
ency of preparation would, therefore, ac- 
count for more records being kept. The 
reason that Negroes kept more records 
of meat and egg dishes, when fewer of 
these dishes were prepared than in case 
of whites (table a in Appendix), may 
be that they wanted to cooperate by furn- 
ishing 12 records, yet variety of foods 
prepared was limited. Therefore, they 
had to keep more meat and egg prepara- 
tion records. They preferred doing this 
to turning in a number of records of 
cornbread and biscuit preparation, though 
they were free to do so. 

Preparation records of sliced tomatoes 
served to the family during the record 
week are included under vegetable salads, 
since the number of vegetable salads pre- 
pared in these 160 families during the 
study week was small (table a in Appen- 
dix). Sliced tomatoes are not a vege- 
table salad, but since they were frequent- 
ly used and since their preparation, it 
was thought, would be indicative of the 
way the family would prepare salad, n

was decided to accept records for pre- 
paring sliced tomatoes. 

Table b in the Appendix gives a com- 
plete list of foods for which preparation 
records were kept. Records of prepara- 
tion of Irish potatoes, field peas (com- 
mon name for cowpeas), butter beans 
(common name for small lima beans), 
string beans, corn, and okra were the 
vegetables records most often submitted. 
All these vegetables were in season al 
the time of the study. More families 
kept records of cornbread preparation 
than of biscuit preparation. More Negro 
women submitted records of pork dishes; 
more white women of egg dishes. A 
number of both groups kept records of 
preparation of chicken, usually fried 
chicken. Chicken of frying size was in 
season at the time of the study. 

Poor Preparation Practices 

Poor preparation practices are prac- 
tices that are contrary to recommenda- 



tions of food and nutrition specialists. 
Some homemakers in preparing a par- 
ticular dish followed four or even more 
practices contrary to recommendations of 
specialists, while others observed in every 
detail recommendations of specialists. 
Table 2 gives the average number of poor 
preparation practices by food type for the 
four groups of families. 

As will be noted, there were many 
more poor practices in connection with 
preparation of cooked vegetables than 
with the preparation of meat and eggs, 
with breads, and with vegetable 
salads. This was because vegetables 
contain vitamins very easily destroy- 
ed by poor methods of cooking 
and storage. There has been more re- 
search on losses in cooking vegetables 
than in the case of foods of other types 
and, therefore, more possibility for vege- 
table practices receiving a poor rating. 
Then, again, in vegetable cooking we

have the problem of the cooking water 
which is sometimes drained off during 
cooking or after cooking is complete. 

In table 3 are listed kinds of poor prac- 
tices found in the 880 records kept of 
vegetables. Most frequent poor prac- 
tices by white and Negro women were 
starting vegetables in cold water, exces- 
sive cooking, and poor storage between 
cooking and serving. 

The frequency of starting vegetables 
in cold water was probably related in 
part to the kind of vegetables used. Rec- 
ords of preparation of butter beans, field 
peas, Irish potatoes, and corn constituted 
somewhat more than 50 percent of the 
vegetable records. In a previous study it 
was shown that some homemakers had 
been taught by their mothers or some- 
one in the parental homes, preparation 
rules such as: "Put all vegetables except 
leafy vegetables on in cold water." "Start- 
ing beans and peas in cold water makes 
more tender."-^ Evidently, a number of 
homemakers were following preparation 
rules learned from mother. Nutrition- 
ists advise starting vegetables in boiling 
water to reduce cooking time and de- 
stroy oxidases quickly. 

Since time of cooking varies with kind 
of vegetable, with maturity of vegetable, 



with quantity cooked, with size and kind 
of cooking utensil, it was often difficult 
to draw a dividing line between over- 
cooked and properly cooked vegetables. 
Vegetables classified as "excessive cook- 
ing" are those which were without doubt 
cooked too much. In making this classi- 
fication, the time table for boiling vege- 
tables given in "Hows and Whys of 
Cooking," by Halliday and Noble, was 
.consulted.-^ 

The practice of allowing a sufficiently 
cooked vegetable to remain in the warm- 
er, in the oven, or on the back of the 
stove until served was regarded as poor 
storage between cooking and serving. 
Vegetables were cooked oftentimes in the 
middle of the morning and kept warm 
after cooking until dinner tiine when 
they were served. This practice was 
classified as poor storage between cook- 
ing and serving. Keeping vegetables 
warm until served was not considered a 
poor practice when total time of cook- 
ing and of keeping warm did not ex- 
ceed time regarded as excessive cooking.

SOME FACTORS RELATED TO FOOD PREPARATION 



9 



The practice of cooking foods in the 
early morning to be served at noon is 
said to have come originally from desire 
to reduce to the minimum heat from 
cooking in the house. In farm homes 
in which most of these homemakers were 
reared, wood was used as fuel and con- 
tinued heat in the kitchen is especially 
enervating in warm weather. 

Fifty-one of the 80 white families and 
one of the 80 Negro families had gas. 
electric, or oil cookstoves. Seventy-one 
percent of the vegetable dishes in white 
families and 68 percent in Negro fam- 
ilies with wood and /or coal cookstoves 
only, were poorly stored from time be- 
tween cooking and serving. Forty-six 
percent of the vegetable dishes, in white 
families with gas, electric, or oil cook- 
stoves, were poorly stored between cook- 
ing and serving. It would thus seem 
that the poor practice is not entirely due 
to absence of an electric, gas, or oil cook- 
stove. It may be that practices have been 
held over from parental homes where 
wood cookstoves were used. Work sched- 
ules as well as methods of preparation 
may be handed down from mother to 
daughter. 

Storage of vegetables indoors, usually 
in the kitchen (not refrigerated) over- 
night before using and/or preparing vege- 
tables for cooking the afternoon or night 
before were classified as poor storage be- 
tween harvesting and cooking. Twenty- 
six percent of the vegetable records kept 
by homemakers in white families of $20.00 
and under housing value, used poor stor- 
age between harvesting or purchasing 
and cook ng. About 8 percent of the 
vegetable records kept by homemakers in 
the other three groups had this poor prac- 
tice. Homemakers in white families of 
$20,00 and under housing value were 
particularly prone to harvest vegetables 
the afternoon of the day before using and 
to prepare them then. Shelling butter 
beans and field peas ahead was fairly 
common. Research studies show that 
beans and peas stored in pods lose less 



vitamin C than if stored shelled. 

An important factor no doubt respon- 
sible for homemakers in white families of 
120.00 and under housing, shelling peas 
and beans ahead of time more frequently 
than homemakers in other groups was 
that they had more young children. Pre- 
paring vegetables ahead was perhaps one 
means of distributing their work load. 
They spent, during the record week, an 
average of 69 hours in homemaking ac- 
tivities. Total time spent by homemakers 
in the higher housing value white group 
averaged 63 hours, and by Negro home- 
makers in both housing value groups, 60 
hours,-/ Homemakers need a list of food 
activities that can best be done in ad- 
vance. 

There were three general types of sup- 
per meals served by families of this study 
during the study period: (1) left-overs 
from dinner, (2) sandwiches, (3) a meal 
somewhat resembling breakfast. The first 
was the most common. It was more com- 
mon among white families than among 
Negro families. It was more common in 
white families of low housing than of 
high housing value. Vegetables left 
from dinner were usually eaten without 
being reheated. Sometimes these vege- 
tables were stored in safes (a movable 
stand with shelves, closed back and sides, 
and screened doors in front, used for 
keeping provisions from insects), in the 
oven, or in the warmer, in the interval 
between dinner and supper. No relation 
was found in ownership of a refrigerator, 
or in type of refrigerator, and storage 
of vegetables between meals. However, 
all white families, except one, owned eith- 
er an ice or a mechanical refrigerator. 
Only 12 Negro families did not have a 
refrigerator of either kind. These 12 
families kept few vegetables from one 
meal to the next. In fact, some of them 
served no supper meal at all. 

The practice of storing left-over vege-

Dickins, Miss. Agr. Exp. Sta. Bull, No. 424, 
1945.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 433 



tables on stoves or in safes has no doubt 
been carried over from the time when 
there were no refrigerators. The factor 
responsible for continuation of this prac- 
tice on the part of some is preference for 
vegetables such as those that remain at 
room temperature. The fat hardens on 
refrigerated vegetables and this is un- 
palatable. Then, too, space in refriger- 
ators is often quite limited. Homemak- 
ers need instruction concerning foods 
that can best be left out of the refriger- 
ator. 

As will be noted, the practice of using 
soda in preparation of vegetables was al- 
most altogether limited to Negro fam- 
ilies (table 3). Recent studies have shown 
that the use of soda is not destructive of 
vitamins when only a small amount is 
used and the vegetable cooked until ten- 
der and no longer, and served soon aft- 
er. However, families in this study using 
soda cooked the vegetable excessively 
and/ or allowed it to stand on a stove 
for some time before serving. 

It is interesting here to note that even 
though a number of homemakers used 
poor practices in vegetable preparation, 
most vegetables were eaten and liked by 
family members. All family members 
were reported "as having eaten 95 percent 
of the vegetable dishes for which records 
were kept. However, record keeping 
was limited to those vegetable dishes 
ordinarily served when the vegetable was 
in season. 

Poor practices in meat and egg prep- 
aration were in most cases frying meat 
and eggs in smoking grease, or boiling 
rather than simmering eggs. Other poor 
practices included cooking chicken in 
water in which soda had been added in 
order to make tender, soaking young 
chicken in soda water, soaking liver in 
boiling water before cooking to draw out 
the blood. 

Poor practices in bread preparation in- 
cluded, for the most part, using more soda 
than the recommended amount, one-half 
teaspoonful to a cup of sour milk. (This 



amount would vary with acidity of the 
milk and for this reason some of the 
bread records may have been incorrectly 
rated.) Several white homemakers pre- 
pared rolls with yeast, soda and baking 
powder. The use of such a recipe was 
regarded as a poor practice, since no sour 
milk was used to neutralize the soda, 
and since sufficient yeast had been added 
to make rolls light. Use of excess soda 
gives a yellow color and a disagreeable 
flavor. In addition, an alkaline reaction 
favors the destruction of thiamin by heat. 

The most common poor practice in 
connection with preparation of sliced to- 
matoes was slicing sometime before the 
meal and placing on the dining table 
where they would be eaten later. Other 
poor preparation practices in salad prep- 
aration included grinding cabbage for 
slaw; peeling, cutting into small pieces, 
boiling, then draining potatoes for potato 
salad; cutting up fine all vegetables and 
allowing to stand in water before drain- 
ed and made into salad. 

Food Preparation Rated 

Poor practices found in preparation 
records of each homemaker were check- 
ed, totaled, and divided by number of 
food preparation records kept. Families 
were then classified into three groups. 
(1) Good preparation. Less than 1 poor 
practice per dish; (2) Fair preparation* 
From 1 to 1.5 poor practices per dish; 
(3) Poor preparation. More than 1.5 
poor practices per dish. This classifica- 
tion has two main weaknesses: (1) All 
poor practices are not equally poor; (2) 
Families in which more vegetable rec- 
ords were kept were more likely to have 
a lower preparation rating than other 
families. One might say in answer to 
these two criticisms that very poor prac- 
tices and many poor practices seemed to 
be related and that most families kept 
about the same number of vegetable prep- 
aration records. 

The method of classifying families ac- 
cording to number of poor practices per 
dish prepared for which a record was

was a tendency for families with pre- 
school and school children to have some- 
what better food preparation ratings. In 
this study, homemakers in families with 
children were younger than homemakers 
in families without children and since 
younger homemakers made higher food 
preparation ratings than older home- 
makers (table 5), families with children 
would be expected to have higher food 
preparation ratings. Younger homemak- 
ers without children were not, as a rule, 



interested in cooperating in this record 
study. 

In a previous study of this series^ a 
tendency on the part of older homemak- 
ers to try fewer new dishes within a stat- 
ed period of time than of younger home- 
makers was found. Nutrition investi- 
gators are making available from day to 
day results of studies on conservation of 
food value in cooking, and hence the 
group who fails to change with new rec- 
ommendations is the group using more 
poor practices. 

Since smaller families of this study 
were more often families with older 
homemakers, there was a tendency, 
though not marked, for smaller families 
to have lower food preparation ratings 
than larger families. Thirty-six percent 
of the white families of two members 
and 39 percent of four or more members, 
had preparation ratings of good, while 
22 percent of the Negro families of two 
members and 30 percent of four or more

members had preparation ratings of good. 
White famiUes of this study averaged 3.5 
members, Negro famiUes 3.6 members. 
Median size of family (the size halfway 
between the largest and smallest) for 
both whites and Negroes was three mem- 
bers. 

The fact that younger homemakers, 
especially younger Negro homemakers. 
had more schooling than older homemak- 
ers may account, at least in part, for 
differences in food preparation ratings of 
older and younger women. More school- 



ing makes for more understanding of the 
printed word, in which form findings of 
research in food preparation are available. 
Most of the white homemakers with col- 
lege training, and most of the Negro 
homemakers with 10 grades or more 
schooling, were under 45 years of age. 
Figure 1 shows preparation rating of 
white and Negro homemakers with vary-

be noted, there were twice as many white 
famiHes and five times as many Negro 
famiHes with preparation ratings of good 
in famiHes classified in category of most 
schooling for homemaker as classified in 
category of least schooling for homemak- 
er. The fact that there were 19 women 
with less than seven grades schooling 
willing to cooperate in this study, was be- 
cause other members of their families 
with more schooling were willing to keep 
the records for them and, also, because 
they had a supervisor to assist them. 

Foods courses, such as are taught in 
departments of home economics of junior 
high schools, senior high schools, colleges, 
and by agricultural extension clubs, give 
up-to-date information on food prepara- 
tion. Unfortunately, classroom and club 
teaching is not always carried back into 
the home. Then, too, this subject mat- 
ter is continually changing. Methods of 
preparation recommended in 1923 or 
1933 cannot be used today. However, if 
food teachers do a good job, their stu- 



dents will be well aware of the chang- 
ing nature of this science of food prepara- 
tion and be ever on the alert for the 
latest developments. 

Families in which there were one or 
more members who had had training in 
home economics were more likely to own 
books, bulletins, pamphlets, and to sub- 
scribe to magazines dealing with food 
in its various aspects. 

In table 7 and figure 2, food prepara- 
tion ratings of families with one or more 
members having studied home economics 
in school, college, or club are compared 
with families with no member having 
had such training. About three-fourths 
of the white families and four-tenths of 
the Negro families had one or more mem- 
bers with some training in home eco- 
nomics—a much higher proportion than 
was the case with families of the larger 
study from which these families were 
drawn. More home economics training 
in families of this record sample may 
have been one factor in their better rec-

they were drawn. 

Economic Status of Family and 
Food Preparation Rating 

Housing value (monthly rent or rent- 
al value, unfurnished, of house or apart- 
ment in which the family resided) was 
used in this study as a basis for classify- 
ing families into economic groups. As 
will be noted from table 8 and figure 3, 
forty-six percent of the white families 
with housing values of $20.00 and under, 
and 18 percent with housing values of 
120.01 to 140.00, had preparation ratings 
of poor. Thirty-three percent of the 
Negroes with housing values of $7.50 
and under, and 24 percent with housing 
values of $7.51 to $20.00, had preparation 
ratings of poor. Members of families re- 
siding in houses of less value had com- 
pleted fewer grades in school. The wom- 
en and girls in these families had less 
often studied home economics. These 
families had less reading material to as- 
sist them in better food preparation. Fa- 



cilities for food preparation were not as 
good as for the group with higher hous- 
ing value. The low socioeconomic status 
family is, therefore, doubly disadvantaged 
as far as food consumed by the family 
is concerned. The food supply it con 
sumes is less adequate in amounts of the 
various nutrients. The methods of prep- 
aration and /or serving they use are less 
likely to be methods that conserve the 
nutrients. 

Family Background of Homemaker 
and Male Head and Food 
Preparation Rating 

Husbands and wives in families of this 
study were rather homogeneous as far 
as family background was concerned. On 
the family history schedule, the following 
question was asked: "Any other factors 
that might account for methods of food 
preparation used: nationality of homemak- 
er and male head, religion, experience of 
parents or grandparents?" Practically all 
homemakers and male heads in the 16G 
families included were Protestant, native 
white or Negro, reared on a Mississippi

farm. In only 13 families, 10 white and 
3 Negro, had both male head and home- 
maker been reared in town. In only 
three families had both been reared out- 
side the State, and in two of these fam- 
ilies they had been reared in another 
Southern state. 

In nearly 60 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies, either the homemaker, male head, 
or their parents had been house servants 
in the home of a white family, during 
which period they had eaten in the home 
of this family. Homemakers in 30 of 
the 80 Negro families had, themselves, 
worked and eaten regularly in homes of 



white famibes. 

As will be noted from table 9, Negro 
homemakers who had eaten regularly in 
homes of white families, less often had 
food preparation records scoring poor 
than did those who had not had this ex- 
perience. However, there were slightly 
more Negro homemakers scoring good 
in food preparation in the group who 
had never eaten regularly in the home of 
a white family. Included in this group 
were Negro women who were especially 
advantaged as far as schooling and eco- 
nomic status were concerned.

homemakers of this study had assisted 
with preparation of food in parental 
homes. Assistance ranged from watch- 
ing the bread or turnip greens to doing all 
the cooking for the parental family. The 
principal reasons given for no preparation 
experience in parental home was a sister 
helping with the cooking, and the home- 
maker being responsible for other house- 
hold or farm tasks, and not being per- 
mitted by the cook to come into the kit- 
chen. There was a rather marked ten 
dency for families in which the home- 
maker had not had experience in food 
preparation in her parental home to make 
higher preparation ratings. It may be 
that women without previous experience 
in preparation are less tradition bound. 
However, the number of cases of those 
without preparation experience in par- 
ental home was small. Methods used in 
the preparation of vegetables and breads 
were often reported by homemakers as 
those taught them in their parental 
homes. The source of the methods of 
preparation for meats and for vegetable 
salads was less often that of the parental 
home. 

Male heads in 25 of the white families 
and in 18 of the Negro families had as- 



sisted parental families with food prepara- 
tion. One homemaker stated that her 
husband had taught her to cook. 

Time Expenditures in Food Prepara- 
tion and Scheduling of Homemaker 

Most of the dishes for which records 
were kept were prepared by the home- 
maker. Ninety-four percent of the 
breads, 91 percent of the vegetable dishes, 
90 percent of the meat dishes, and 80 per- 
cent of the salads were thus prepared. 

White famihes in which the minimum 
time was spent in food preparation more 
often made preparation ratings of good 
than did white families in which the 
maximum time was spent in food prep- 
aration (table 10). In the Negro fam- 
ilies, however, there were slightly more 
ratings of good in the group spending 
the maximum time, but more ratings also 
of poor in this group. Homemakers, 
both white and Negro, in families with 
poor preparation ratings spent on the av- 
erage a httle more time in food prepara- 
tion than did those in families with good 
ratings. 

There was, however, a closer relation 
ship in the time in which the homemaker 
scheduled food preparation activities and

*In 9 white families and 6 Negro families, homemakers did not, themselves, prepare dinner 
as many as 4 days out of the Monday-Friday period. These 15 families are not included in the 
tabulation. This tabulation is limited to the Monday-Friday period, since time expenditures of 
homemakers on Saturday and Sunday differed greatly from expenditures during the remainder of 
the week.

percent of the white famihes and 30 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated good, 21 
percent of the white famines and 22 per- 
cent of the Negro famihes rated poor. 
When the interval between beginning 
preparation and serving was more than 
IVi hours, 17 percent of the white fam- 
ilies and 10 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies rated good, 67 percent of the white 
families and 35 percent of the Negro 
families rated poor. A homemaker may 
put her greens on at 9:00 a. m. and leave 
them cooking while she cleans house and 
does the laundry, or she may clean the 
house and start the laundry before put 
ting on the greens. In either case, hei 
time expenditures in preparation of the 
greens would be the same. The product, 
however, would differ. 

Time scheduling is important in food 
preparation. That there was such a close 
relation in time of starting dinner and 
rating in food preparation was because 
starting dinner early usually meant start- 
ing vegetables early and this meant over- 
cooking or having to keep them warm 
until serving time, or both. Of those 
white families in which all vegetables, for 
which records were kept, were excessively 
cooked and/or stored warm until served, 
the interval between beginning dinner 
preparation and serving dinner of 14 per- 
cent was V/i hours, and of 50 percent, 
more than IVi hours (table 12). Per- 
centages for corresponding groups in 



which 50 perce - or fewer vegetables, for 
which records v\- kept, were excessively 
cooked and/or st )red warm until served 
were 50 and 17, rrsprctively. 

Poor cooking practice-^ are no doubt 
tied up in part with ■ ;re patterns in- 
herited by homenrl ' rs from the past. 
There is need for ccptiniia] study of best 
time for doing various rr^-aration tasks. 
Which foods can be prep;: ? J first and 
which reserved for las» minute prepara- 
tion.? The answer to these questions 
changes with the developments of re- 
search, new products, and equipment. 
Then, too, other tasks of the hcmemai - 
er must be considered, for food prepara 
tion is only one of a number. 

Type of Menu Served and 
Preparation Rating 

From table 13, it would seem that fnm 
ilies serving the least and the most dishes 
during the study week were more likely 
to have poorer methods of preparation 
than those serving a moderate number. 
The group serving 75 or fewer dishes 
during the study week were Negro fam- 
ilies of low economic status. They had 
had little schooling and had been less 
often exposed to modern food preparation 
instruction. Facilities for preparing and 
for serving were limited. 

Dishes served were of three types: (1) 
prepared dishes, (2) left-overs, and (3) 
ready prepared dishes. For example^ 
fried steak, scalloped potatoes, biscuit, if

prepared for the meal in which served, 
were considered as prepared dishf^s Pre- 
pared dishes left from a previous meal 
were classified as left-overs. Milk, butter, 
crackers, bakery rolls, jelly (either home- 
make or purchased) are examnles of 
ready-prepared dishes. These dishes are 
m a form ready for eating with little or 
no expenditure of time in preparation. 

About 11 percent of the dishes served 
by white families serving from 76 to 110 
dishes during the study week were left- 
overs. About the same percentage serv- 
ed by Negro families serving fewer than 
76 dishes and serving from 76 to 110 
dishes during this period were left-overs. 
However, 20 percent of the dishes served 
by white families serving more than 110 
dishes were left-overs. Many families in 
the white group serving so many dishes 
were following the traditional menu pat- 
tern for supper — left-overs from dinner 
for supper. This meant for supper a repe- 
tition of dinner rather than a simpler 
meal. Homemakers who follow tradition 
al menu patterns may also follow tradi- 
tional methods of preparation. This 
would account for l(5wer preparation rat- 
ings with the greater use of left-overs. 

In table 14, white and Negro families 
in the three preparation rating groups 
are classified according to number of left- 



overs served during the record week. As 
will be noted, families serving the great- 
est number of left-overs more often had 
preparation ratings of poor, while those 
serving the fewest number more often 
had preparation ratings of good or fair. 
Cooked vegetables even when stored cov- 
ered in the refrigerator lose some nutri- 
tive value. Therefore, the practice of 
serving for supper left-over vegetables 
from dinner is not desirable. From a 
nutritional standpoint, a supper with a 
hot dish and fresh salad or fruit, or of 
sandwiches, salad, and fruit, is more de- 
sirable. 

Families serving more prepared and 
ready-prepared dishes, more often had 
food preparation scores of good than 
those serving fewer of these dishes. Those 
serving fewer prepared and ready-prepar- 
ed dishes more often had food prepara- 
tion ratings of poor (table 15). The fact 
that families of higher economic status 
served more prepared and ready-prepar- 
ed dishes would account in part for their 
better preparation ratings (table 8).

drain boards, an electric, gas or oil cook- 
stove, a mechanical refrigerator, were not

owned by Negroes to any extent and, 
therefore, it is not possible to compare 
preparation ratings of groups with and 
without such equipment. Only two of 
the 80 Negro famiHes had kitchen sinks 
with one or more drain boards; only one 
an electric, gas or oil cookstove; only 8 
mechanical refrigerators. 

In table 16, the relation of ownership 
of these three types of equipment by 
white families and their food prepara- 
tion ratings are shown. Families who did 
not own this equipment made more fre- 



quently low food preparation ratings. 
Difference in economic status of the 
groups owning and not owning the 
equipment may account for much of the 
difference in preparation ratings. 

That ownership of an electric, gas, or 
oil cookstove seemed more favorable than 
did ownership of a sink with drains or a 
mechanical refrigerator was, as has been 
previously suggested, because homemak- 
ers with wood and/or coal ranges only, 
often cook dinner in the cool of the morn- 
ing to avoid having continued heat in

the kitchen. (All white families except 
one not having a mechanical refrigerator, 
had an ice refrigerator; only 14 of the 50 
families not having a sink with drains 
had no sink; and the remaining 36 had 
a sink with no drain boards.) They 
keep the dinner warm until noon when it 
is served. This practice is destructive of 
vitamins. Figure 5 shows the prepara- 
tion ratings of white families with and 
without electric, gas or oil cookstoves. 

There seemed to be little relation in 
ownership of common cooking utensils 



and preparation rating (table c in Ap- 
pendix). In other words, families own- 
ing double boilers or equivalent made 
about as good preparation ratings as those 
not owning them. Families owning 
roasting pans made about as good rat- 
ings as those who did not. However, 
families with measuring cups and spoons 
and with paring knives, more frequently 
had good ratings, less, poor ratings.

might affect food preparation, a very 
large kitchen causing extra steps and 
time, a very small kitchen causing crowd- 
ed work facilities, resulting also in loss 
of time. Such situations might encour- 
age homemakers to start meal prepara- 
tion sooner than would be the case with 
a kitchen of moderate size. 

As will be noted from table 17, fam- 
ilies, both white and Negro, with kit- 
chens of 100 square feet and less, made 
lower ratings than did those with larger 
kitchens. Families with moderate sized 
kitchens more often rated fair and less 
often poor than did families with large 
or small kitchens. However, white and 
Negro famihes of this study with large 
kitchens were more likely to have food 
preparation ratings of good. 

Storage Facilities and Preparation 
Rating 

In table d in die Appendix, white and 
Negro families in the three food prepara- 
tion rating groups are classified by kit- 
chen storage facilities which they have. 
Families with kitchen closets or pantries, 
with built-in kitchen cabinets, with olh- 
er kitchen cabinets such as cabinets with 
compartments for flour, sugar, a rolling 
board, and with cellars or outhouses, had 
better preparation ratings than did those 
without such facilities. This was, at leastd( 



in part, because, families with better stor- 
age facilities were also families of bet- 
ter economic status and education. 

One interesting exception to the rule 
"ownership of storage facilities — better 
food preparation" was ownership of a 
kitchen safe, an outmoded piece of kit- 
chen equipment, formerly quite popular 
for storage of cooked foods. Fifty-three 
percent of the white families and 38 per- 
cent of the Negro families with a kit- 
chen safe had poor preparation ratings, 
while 28 percent of the white families and 
25 percent of the Negro families having 
no kitchen safe had poor preparation rat- 
ings. Those with safes rated low be- 
cause they used poor storage. Evidently 
those using better methods of storage had 
disposed of their safes.^ 

■^/Distance from the kitchen to the garden 
was also another factor considered as affecting 
food preparation. If, for instance, the garden 
was far from the kitchen, the homemaker might 
gather or have gathered the vegetables ahead of 
time, storing them inadequately until prepara- 
tion time, whereas, if the garden was near 
the kitchen, she might go out when she was 
ready to prepare the meal, gather the vegetables, 
bring them in, and cook them immediately. 
This may be true of farm families whose gar- 
dens are often far from the house. In these 
town families, distance of the garden did not 
seem important. However, the majority of gar- 
is were less than 36 feet from the kitchen.

Convenience as well as possession of 
storage facilities and food preparation rat- 
ing are related (table 18). Here, too, 
economic situation is one factor, families 
with dish cabinets near sinks more often 
being families of higher economic status. 

Location of Dining Table With 
Respect to Stove and Serving Unit 
and Food Preparation Rating 

According to Miss Maud Wilson, two 
important connections between working 
surfaces and areas concerned with prepa- 
ration and consumption of food are: (1) 
stove near to dining table; (2) serving 
unit near to dining table.—/ These con- 
nections were investigated in this study 
as it was thought that convenience of 
stove to dining table, and of serving unit 
to dining table, might mean less stand- 
ing around of food, and hence, better 
prepared food. "Near to" was defined 
as connecting or only two or three steps 
between, with no other equipment to be 
walked around. 

Another connection mentioned as im- 



portant by Miss Wilson was nearness of 
refrigerator to serving unit. However, in 
this study there were only 24 families 
(19 whi te and 5 Negro) with the re- 
frigerator near the serving unit. Most of 
these 24 families were owners of me- 
chanical refrigerators. Ice refrigerators 
are often kept outside the kitchen.^ 

When the stove and dining table were 
near, when the serving unit and dining 
table were near, there were more ratings 
of good food preparation, fewer of poor 
food preparation (tables 19 and 20). As 
will be noted, 50 percent of the white

•ii/Other connections studied were location of 
stove with respect to dishwashing unit; location 
Df mixing unit with respect to dishwashing unit; 
location of dining table with respect to dish- 
ivashing unit. Families with these areas con- 
necting or only two or three steps between with 
no other equipment to be walked around had 
no better, and in many cases not as good, prep- 
aration ratings than did those with areas not 
near.

^In 8 white families and 29 Negro families, the serving unit and the dining table were the same. 



families and 38 percent of the Negro fam- 
ilies with stove and dining table near 
made preparation ratings of good, while 
27 percent of the white families and 20 
percent of the Negro families in which 
this equipment was not near made prep- 
aration ratings of good (table 19). Forty- 
six percent of the white families and 
31 percent of the Negro families with 
serving unit and dining table near, and 
21 precent of the white families and 18 
percent of the Negro families with this 
equfpment not near made preparation 
ratings of good. This suggests that con- 
venience of stove to dining table, of serv- 
ing unit to dining table, may mean bet- 
ter prepared food. Further investigation 
is needed here. 

Nearly 60 percent of the white fam 
ilies and about 75 percent of the Negro 
families ate entirely or most of the time 
in their kitchens. However, about 70 
percent of the white families had a din- 
ing room or both dining room and break- 
fast room. Forty percent of the Negro 
families had a dining room. Families 
in this study who ate in the kitchen all 
or part of the time made on the whole 
somewhat better preparation ratings than 
famihes eating in another room. 
Summary and Conclusions 

The purpose of this investigation was 
to study some of the factors probably re- 
lated to food preparation. The factors 
examined were family compositio^n, 
schooling, and food and nutrition in 
formation of homemaker, economic status 



of family, family background of home- 
maker and male head, time expenditures 
in food preparation, scheduling of home- 
maker, type of menus served, equipment 
for food preparation, and arrangement 
of this equipment. 

One hundred and sixty families were 
included — 80 white families with hous- 
ing value of $20.00 and under axid of 
$20.01 to $40.00, and 80 Negro families 
with housing value of $7.50 and under 
and of $7.51 to $20.00. (Housing value 
is defined as monthly rent or rental value, 
unfurnished, of house or rooms in which 
the family resided.) 

Data were obtained in the summer of 
1943 from records kept by homemakers 
and from schedules filled out by means of 
personal interviews with these women. 
White and Negro home economists su- 
pervised record keeping and secured oth- 
er information by interviewing the home- 
maker. 

The 160 white and Negro homemakers 
kept records of 1,857 of the dishes they 
prepared during the record week. The 
dishes for which records were kept were 
limited to vegetables, meat and eggs, 
breads and vegetable salads. Most of the 
dishes for which records were kept were 
prepared by the homemaker — 94 percent 
of the breads, 91 percent of the vegetable 
dishes, 90 percent of the meat dishes, and 
80 percent of the salads. Food prepara- 
tion of each family was rated according 
to average number of poor practices (or 
practices contrary to recommendations of 



SOME FACTORS RELATED TO FOOD PREPARATION 



25 



food and/or nutrition specialists) per 
dish per preparation record kept. Fam- 
ilies were classified into three groups: 

(1) good preparation, including those 
with less than one poor practice per dish; 

(2) fair preparation, those with from 1 
to 1.5 poor practices per dish; (3) poor 
preparation, those with more than 1.5 
poor practices per dish. Twenty-nine 
percent of the 160 families rated thus 
had good preparation, 40 percent fair 
preparation, and 31 percent poor prepara 
tion. 

Families with younger homemakers 
made better preparation ratings. The fact 
that younger homemakers had more 
schooling than older homemakers was in 
part responsible. Schooling of home- 
maker and preparation rating seemed to 
be related. 

Families in which one or more mem- 
bers had studied home economics in 
school, college, or club had somewhat bet- 
ter preparation ratings than those in 
which no member had had this training. 

Families residing in houses of lower 
rent or rental value more frequently made 
preparation ratings of poor than did those 
residing in houses of higher rent or rent- 
al value. Homemakers in the lower hous- 
ing value groups had less schooling. The 
lower housing value families less often 
had members who had studied home eco- 
nomics, less often had reading material 
to assist them in better food preparation, 
had poorer facilities for food preparation. 

Negro homemakers who had eaten 
regularly in homes of white families less 
frequently had food preparation records 
scoring poor than did those who had not 
had a similar experience. However, 
there were slightly more Negro home- 
makers scoring good in food preparation 
in the group who had never eaten reg- 
ularly in the home of a white family. 

Methods used in the preparation of 
vegetables and of breads were often re- 
ported by homemakers as those taught 
them in their parental homes. The 



source of the method of preparation for 
meats and for vegetable salads was less 
often reported by homemakers as that 
taught them in parental home. 

There was a tendency for those fam- 
ilies in which the maximum time was 
spent in food preparation to have more 
often ratings of poor. There was like- 
wise a tendency for families with home- 
makers spending more time in food prep- 
aration to have lower preparation ratings. 

There was, however, a closer relation- 
ship in the time in which the homemak- 
er scheduled food preparation activities 
and food preparation rating than in total 
time she spent in such activities and food 
preparation ratings. When the interval 
between beginning preparation and serv- 
ing dinner was 1^2 hours or less, 55 per- 
cent of the white families and 30 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated good, 21 
percent of the white families and 22 per- 
cent of the Negro families rated poor. 
When the interval between beginning 
preparation and serving dinner was more 
than lYi hours, 17 percent of the white 
families and 10 percent of the Negro 
families rated good, 67 percent of the 
white families and 35 percent of the 
Negro families rated poor. Starting din- 
ner early often meant starting vegetabbs 
early and this meant overcooking or hav 
ing to keep them warm until meal time. 

Families serving the greatest number 
of left-overs at meals during the study 
week more often had preparation ratings 
of poor. The traditional supper meal is 
left-overs from dinner. Homemakers 
who follow traditional menu patterns may 
also follow traditional methods of prep- 
aration. 

Families serving more prepared and 
ready-prepared dishes at meals during the 
study week more often had preparation 
ratings of good; those serving fewer of 
these dishes less often had ratings of 
good. The number of these two types of 
dishes served seems to be related to eco- 
nomic status of the family.

MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 433 



Families owning food preparation 
equipment such as a sink with one or 
two drains, an electric, gas or oil cook- 
stove, a mechanical refrigerator, had bet- 
ter preparation ratings than those not 
owning such equipment. Ownership of 
an electric, gas or oil cookstove seemed 
favorable for good preparation. This 
was not only because families of high- 
er economic status more often had such 
equipment, but because wood and/or coal 
ranges used in lieu of the others cause 
continued heat in the kitchen. To avoid 
this, many homemakers cook dinner in 
early morning, allowing it to remain on 
the stove until served. This practice is 
destructive of vitamins. 

Families with kitchens of 100 square 
feet or less made lower preparation rat- 
ings than did those with larger kitchens. 
Small kitchens cause crowded work fa- 
cilities and inadequate storage. Families 
with good storage facilities such as kit- 
chen pantries, built-in cabinets, kitchen 
cabinets, had better preparation ratings 
than did those without such facilities. 
Convenience as well as possession of stor- 
age facilities seemed important in food 
preparation. 

When the stove and dining table were 
near, and when the serving unit and din- 
mg table were near, there were more 
ratings of good preparation, fewer of poor 
food preparation. Convenience of thi.-! 
equipment may mean less standing around 
of food, and hence, better prepared food 

Preparation ratings are the sum total 
of many factors. No single one can ac- 



count for ratings of "good." In this par- 
ticular investigation there were too few 
families to study the interrelationships of 
all the factors. 

White families seemed a more homo- 
geneous group on the basis of food prep- 
aration rating and education when an- 
alyzed statistically. There is need for 
further study of this problem, for it is 
on the basis of such study that effective 
programs to improve practices can be de- 
veloped. 

From this study it would seem that 
better preparation would result (1) with 
more schooling, especially for homemak- 
ers in low socioeconomic families, since 
better preparation is dependent in part on 
better understanding of the spoken and 
printed word; (2) with home economics 
training for all homemakers; (3) with 
higher incomes for low socioeconomic 
status groups in order that they may ob- 
tain more of the material, and cultural 
equipment that makes better preparation 
more easily obtainable; (4) with clearer 
understanding on the part of home eco- 
nomics educators of the role of tradition 
in food preparation, in menu patterns, in 
time expenditure patterns and the source 
of such traditions; (5) with clearer under- 
standing on the part of home economists 
of activities that go on in homes in order 
that better assistance can be given in time 
scheduling and in the choice, use, and 
arrangement of equipmnet that facilitates 
good preparation. Close coordination be- 
tween management and tood and nutri- 
tion is very much needed.

The Vitamin A Potency of 
Creamery Butter Produced 
In Mississippi 



By F. H. HERZER AND MARVIN GIEGER 



MISSISSIPPI STATE COLLEGE 
AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION 
CLARENCE DORMAN, Director 
STATE COLLEGE MISSISSIPPI 



THE VITAMIN A POTENCY OF CREAMERY BUTTER 
PRODUCED IN MISSISSIPPI 

By F. H. HERZER and MARVIN GIEGER 



The Food and Nutrition Board of the 
National Research Council, in making 
wartime food recommendations, recogniz- 
ed that a seasonal variation in the vitamin 
A potency of milk and butter existed. 
While previous studies have disclosed 
many fundamental facts regarding the 
vitamin A content of butterfat, the act- 
ual variation of this substance in the 
butter offered the consuming public in 
the various sections of the United States 
at different seasons of the year was not 
known. A nation-wide study to learn 
these facts was recommended by the Bu- 
reau of Dairy Industry and the Office of 
Experiment Stations. To date the Ex- 
periment Stations of 19 states have par- 
ticipated in this project. The Mississippi 
Station began its first studies in March 
1943. 

An appraisal of the actual contribution 
which dairy products make to the na 
tional requirements was suggested by 
Palmer and Jenness, who estimated that 
the total vitamin A potency in the milk 
and milk products consumed in the Unit- 
ed States is adequate to supply the vita- 
min A needs of 42,000,000 people. If 
by conserving the carotene in hays and 
silages and developing winter grazing, 
the vitamin A potency of winter milk 
could be increased to that of average 
summer milk, the vitamin A require- 
ments of 11,000,000 more people could 
be satisfied. This would mean that 40 
percent of the total units now considered 
essential in the human diet would be 
contributed by the dairy industry. 

Since the vitamin A potency of milk 
depends upon the carotene content of the 
feeds consumed by the cow, conditions 
which are conducive to fresh growing 
pasture grasses, properly cured hay, and 
preserved silage, will enhance the vita- 
min value of the milk and at the same 
time stimulate production. Unquestion- 



ably, a higher vitamin A potency of milk 
and butter can be secured immediately 
and economically through better pasture 
management and the proper care of cur- 
ed roughages. 

Methods 

Samples of butter were secured from 
three creameries located within a radius 
of 25 miles. These plants make about 
60 percent of the butter manufactured 
in Mississippi. The samples selected by 
these plants represented butter of three 
general types, namely: that made from 
cream separated on the farm and deliver- 
ed sweet to the creamery, designated as 
A; that from cream separated on the 
farm and held in most instances until 
sour before delivery to the plant, design- 
ated as B; and that from sweet cream 
secured by separating sweet milk at the 
plant, designated as C. 

Much of the cream delivered to cream- 
ery A averaged 0.18 to 0.25 percent aci- 
dity. This cream was heated to 160° F. 
by a steam jet and agitated in a coil 
pasteurizer for 30 minutes at 155° F. be- 
fore cooling to churning temperature. 
The bulk of this cream was churned 
within 1 or 2 hours after pasteurization. 

The butter used in this project from 
creamery B was made from sour cream 
ranging in acidity from 0.5 to 1 percent, 
much of which originated with smaller 
shippers and cream stations scattered 
throughout the State. This was neutral- 
ized with sodium carbonate and sodium 
bicarbonate to approximately 0.25 percent 
acidity, forewarmed to 90° F. and flash 
pasteurized at 210° F. in a high 
temperature vacuum-type unit. As the 
hot cream sprayed into the vacuum com- 
partment the temperature dropped to 
140° F. This cream was immediately 
cooled to churning temperature over a 
surface cooler, held from 1 to 2 hours, 
and churned. 



4 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 434 



The cream used by creamery C was 
secured by separating fresh milk deUver- 
ed to the plant. This cream had a very 
low acidity of 0.10 percent to 0.12 per- 
cent and was heated to 155° F. in a 
coil vat, pasteurized and held for 30 min- 
lites before being cooled to churniaig 
temperature in the vat. 

One pound samples of butter were 
secured from these creameries the first of 
each month. Analyses for carotene, vi- 
tamin A, and composition, (moisture, 
salt, curd, and butterfat) were made im- 
mediately. The butter was held in a 
45° to 50° F. refrigerator to simulate stor- 
age conditions in the retail store and 
home refrigerator. At the end of 15 
days and 30 days storage the same an- 
alyses were made. Since much of the 
butter produced in April, May, and June 
goes into cold storage, additional one- 
pound samples were stored at 0° F. for 5 
months. This butter was then placed in 
a 45° F. storage, analyzed immediately 
and after storage for 15 days and after 
30 days, to learn what effect, if any, 
storage and marketing routine might 
have on the vitamin A content. 

Analytical Methods 

The antimony trichloride method of 
determining vitamin A was used, the 
procedure being that of Koehn and Sher- 
man.^ Crystalline vitamin A alcohol 
(Distillation Products, Inc., 755 Ridge 
Road West, Rochester, New York) was 
used for vitamin A, Standard. 

EXPERIMENTAL 
Effect of Season 

Approximately twice as much butter 
was made during the months of May, 
June, July, and August as in December, 
January, February, and March. This is 
shown in table 1 which lists the percent- 
age of years' production of creamery but- 
ter manufactured each month during the 

iKochn, C. J. and Sherman, W. C. The De- 
termination of Vitamin A and Carotene with a 
Photoelectric Colorimeter. Jour. Biol. Chem., 132: 
527-538. 1940. 



year period from 1940 to 1944. 

A statistical study of the analyses show- 
ed that there was no significant change 
in carotene and vitamin A content of the 
butter during the 15- and 30-day holding 
periods. All analyses of the nine sam- 
ples of butter examined each month were 
therefore averaged in establishing the sea- 
sonal trend. The monthly variation in 
International Units of vitamin A per 
pound of butter throughout the year is 
shown in table 2 and graphically present- 
ed in figure 1. 

A high level of vitamin A potency con- 
tinued through July, August, September, 
and October 1943 and was resumed dur- 
ing April, May, and June of 1944. Dur- 
ing these months the samples of butter 
averaged 18,230 International Units per 
pound. Since these values are probably 
representative of the entire State's make, 
approximately 70 percent of the annual 
butter production would be expected to 
contain a relatively high vitamin A pot- 
ency. 

The lack of feed of high carotene con- 
tent such as properly preserved silage, 
high grade hay, fall and winter cover 
crops, is reflected in the lower levels 
reached during November, December. 
January, February, and March. During 
these months the total vitamin A potency 
averaged slightly over 12,000 Interna- 
tional Units, the lowest level of 10,128 
Units being reached in February. 

With the appearance of pasture grasses 
and clovers some increase in vitamin A 
content is shown on March 1st, however, 
the effect of a plentiful supply of green 
feed is shown by the increase to 18,860 
International Units on April 1st. 

The carotene content of the butter 
reached both higher and lower levels 
than the vitamin A, ranging from 1.55 
in March to 7.86 micrograms per gram 
of butter in August. The vitamin A con- 
tent remained between the rather nar- 
row limits of 4.42 on February 1st and 
7.5 micrograms per gram of butter on

April 1st. The vitamin A recovered from 
its downward trend March 1st, one 
month earlier than the carotene. How- 
ever the carotene increased from 1.55 on 
March 1st to 5.6 on April 1st, which 
was the greatest spread between any two 
months of either material. During the 
months of low carotene intake, namely 
November, December, January, Febru- 
ary, and March, approximately 20 percent 
of the total vitamin A potency was furn- 
ished by carotene, while during the re- 
mainder of the year 30 percent was sup- 
plied by carotene. 



Effect of Short Storage 

The values in table 3 are based on 
the average carotene and vitamin A con- 
tent of the butter from the three cream- 
eries for the first, fifteenth, and thirtieth 
of each month. This butter was held 
in a 45° to 50° F. refrigerator in quarter- 
pound prints, and storage corresponded 
to retail store and home refrigerator con- 
ditions. The data presented indicate that 
both carotene and vitamin A were very 
stable. 

Statistically, the variation in carotene 
and vitamin A due to 15- and 30-day

f igure 2. Seasonal variation of carotene and vitamin A in butter from three Mississippi 
creameries. 



Storage was not significant. F values for 
the 15- and 30-day storage periods were 
1.00 for vitamin A and 0,51 for caro- 
tene. To be statistically significant at 
odds of 20 to 1, the F value for either 
carotene or vitamin A would need to 
exceed 3.11. On numerous sequences the 
15- or 30-day storage samples were high- 
er in carotene or vitamin A than fresh 
butter. These disturbing results have 
been reported by other Stations and a\ 
this time are not exDlainable. 

No trends were established which in- 
dicated any deterioration in the vitamin 
potency due to holding for one month ai 
45° to 50° F. 



Effect of Long Storage 

Much butter goes into cold storage dur- 
mg the season of greatest production. 
This butter is generally held at 0° to -10° 
F. for 3 to 6 months and is then brought 
out during seasonal shortage, whereupon 
it follows the ordinary marketing chan- 
nels at relatively high temperatures. Ad- 
ditional samples of butter were secured 
dunng April, May, and June from the 
same churnings used in the original tests. 
These samples were held in a 0° to -10° 
F. storage room for 5 months, then re- 
moved and placed in a 45° F. refrigerator. 
This butter was analyzed on the 1st, 15th, 
and 30th day after removal from the low

temperature room, and the data are pre- 
sented in table 4. 

From the data obtained, no trend in- 
dicating that the carotene or vitamin A 
decreased due to storage at 0° F. or dur- 
ing the succeeding 30-day holding period 
at 45° F. was established. ^ 

The average values secured for the 
carotene and vitamin A after 5 months 
storage were actually higher than the or- 
iginal samples. While there were a few 
tests which might be questioned, most 
determinations were within the range of 
experimental error and indicate that the 
carotene and vitamin A were not adverse- 
ly affected by 5 months storage at 0° F. 

Effect of Holding Cream 

Of interest was the somewhat lower 
potency of the butter from creamery B, 
the source of the sour cream butter. Al- 
though the three creameries in the study 
were located in the same immediate ter- 
ritory, a study of the data showed a 
significantly lower carotene and vitamin 
A content in the butter from this one 
plant. I 

While the higher acidity in the cream 
used in making the samples of butter se- 
cured from creamery ' B might be expect- 
ed to minimize any reduction in vitamin 
A potency, a series of tests was conduct- 
ed to learn if holding cream at fairly 
high temperatures with accompanying 
high acid, yeast and mold development, 
and partial neutralization, might have 
some influence. 



Five tests were completed wherein 
fresh cream was collected directly from 
the separator, divided into five lots, and 
made into butter after different holding 
periods. Lot 1 was churned immediately 
without pasteurizing. Lot 2 was pas- 
teurized at 155° F. for 30 minutes, cool- 
ed and churned. The remaining lots 
w'tTc held at room temperatures, neutral- 
ized, pasteurized and churned at 3-day 
intervals. 

Some of the samples held at 80° to 90' 
F. developed a very high acidity (1 per- 
cent to L9 percent) and a yeasty moldy 
condition. Although the butter was not 
held for a prolonged storage period, 
much of the butter made from sour 
cream partially neutralized was actually 
in storage for several weeks before be- 
ing analyzed. An examination of table 
6 shows that while there was the same 
ductuation in the carotene and vitamin 
A content experienced in some of the 
Dther tests, no significant reduction in 
vitamm A potency was recorded in the 
iour cream butter. Since feed and pas- 
ture conditions are quite similar in the 
territory immediately surrounding these 
plants, the fact that creamery B receiv- 
ed cream from direct shippers and cream 
stations located in various parts of the 
State possibly npt so favored with satis- 
factory pasture, offers the most logical 
explanation. The most noticeable spread 
between the three butters, occurs in the 
fall and winter months, when many small 
Jairymen make little effort to supply a 
high quality roughage for their cows.

hen heated to 90° F. before entering the 
pasteurizer. The cream was subjected to 
I steam jet which heated it to 200° to 
215° F, then quickly sprayed into a 
v'acuum pan where the temperature drop- 
ped to approximately 140° F. This cream 
chen passed over a surface cooler and 
vvas cooled to churning temperature. Four 

heck tests were made to learn if this 
□articular process had any effect upon 
the vitamin A potency of the resulting 



Iirtter. Samples of the raw cream were 
taken from the forewarmer before treat- 
ment and again off the cooler after be- 
ing completely processed. The samples 
of cream were churned and the butter 
inalyzed. The results of this brief study 
rec:.rdtd in table 7 indicate that this 
method of processing had no effect upon 
the carotene or vitamin A content of the 
butter studied.

Summary 

1. The butter analysed in this study 
ontained approximately 18,000 Inter- 
national Units of vitamin A per pound 
from April to October inclusive. The 
butter exam ncd from November through 
March contained an average of approxi- 
mately 12,000 International Units per 
, ound. 

The similarity of the vitamin A con- 
tent of butter produced in Mississippi to 
the national average as determined from 
results secured by the 19 participating 
states is most striking. The U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture Miscellaneous 
Publication No. 571, "Vitamin A in But- 
ler," records that the summer butter av- 
eraged 18,000 International Units of vit- 
amin A per pound while winter butter 
contained approximately 11,200 units per 
pound. 

2. Approximately seventy percent of 
(he butter made in Mississippi is produc- 
ed during the months of high vitamin A 
(potency. 

3. Holding the butter at 45° F. for 
one month did not lower the carotene 
or vitamin A content. 



4. Holding the butter at 0° F. foi 
5 months followed by 30 days storage 
at 45° F. did not lower the carotene or 
vitamin A content. 

5. The development of varying aci- 
dities in cream and subsequent neutral- 
ization before pasteurization did not low 
er the carotene or vitamin A content. 

6. The use of high temperature vacu- 
um type of pasteurization did not affect 
the carotene or vitamin A content. 

7. The carotene content of the butter 
examined showed a much greater sea- 
sonal variation than the vitamin A con- 
tent. 

Discussion 

The contribution of vitamin A through 
the medium of dairy products is of ma- 
jor nutritional importance to the consum- 
ing public. Figure I shows that the 
lowest level of vitamin A potency of milk 
products occurs in the winter months 
when other foods comprising the human 
diet are also low in vitamin A. It 
would be most desirable if the vitamin 
A content of winter butterfat could be 
held at a higher level. 

Koehn, of the Alabama Station found 



12 



MISSISSIPPI AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BULLETIN 434 



that the milk from cows placed on a 
temporary pasture of Abruzzi Italian rye, 
crimson and white Dutch clover in Feb- 
ruary, increased in 2 weeks time to a 
vitamin A content equal to that of good 
summer milk and remained at that level 
until the permanent pastures were ready 
for spring grazing. An equal increase 
in vitamin A can be expected from the 
grazing of any other growing cover crop. 

Oats, wheat and vetch, in particular, 
have become popular in many sections 
of Mississippi. The Dairy Department 
of Mississippi State College used a mix- 
ture of lYz bushels oats, Yz bushel wheat, 
and 15 pounds vetch to the acre; more 
recently the amount of seed has been in- 
creased to 2 bushels oats, 1 bushel wheat, 
md 15 pounds vetch. 

While, from the standpoint of the nu- 
tritionist, this increase in vitamin A in 
dairy products is of particular importance, 
the actual benefits of direct value to the 
dairyman extend far beyond the improve- 
ment in the quality of milk. 

Financial Returns 

Numerous tests run by the Mississippi 
Station have shown that grazing winter 
cover crops is profitable, and consequent- 
ly cover crops grazing has been practiced 
by the Dairy Department for the. past 
20 years. In a specific test reported by 
J. S. Moore in the December 1943 Farm 
Research, 12 acres were disked and plant- 
ed to oats and vetch in September. By 
November 10th there was a stand of oats 
averaging 8 to 15 inches in height. While 
the dairy herd was already on full win- 
ter ration, 52 cows and 18 heavy spring- 
ers were turned on this field for 15 days. 
The yield of milk increased 16.3 precent 
the first week and 24.6 percent during 
the second week. The value of the in- 
creased production, together with silage 
saved and $31.50 credit for the physical 
improvement of the springers, were giv- 
en a minimum estimate of $176.55 that 
could be attributed to the first 15 days 



grazing. Ordinarily one or two more 
grazing periods can be expected depend- 
ing upon the season. 

Feed 

Moore reports another test wherein 80 
to 90 acres were planted to a mixture of 
oats, wheat and vetch. By the end of 
December sufficient grazing had been 
obtained from these crops to pay all costs 
of seed, preparation of land, and plant- 
ing. One field was not grazed after 
January 1st. The seed was allowed to 
ripen and the crop was harvested for 
feed, yielding 1,678 pounds of grain and 
2,425 pounds of straw per acre. To secure 
this same feed value from corn as a grain 
crop would require a yield of about 30 
bushels of corn per acre. The winter graz- 
mg crop was grown when the land would 
otherwise have been idle, required no 
work after planting, and furnished a 
good cover crop which protected the soil 
from erosion during the winter months. 
A yield of 1% tons of hay per acre was 
secured after fall and early spring graz- 
ing. This crop was removed early 
enough to plant corn. Where the grain 
was allowed to mature it was followed 
with sorghum for silage, sagrain for 
grain or silage, and soybeans for hay. 

Green Manure 

In tht- above test a portion of the 
crop was disked in for soil building. 
This was done on March 24th, after tak- 
ing the cows off on March 15th, and 
amounted to about 5,645 pounds of green 
manure to the acre. Some of the phos- 
phorus and potash of the soil was prob- 
ably conserved and changed to a more 
easily assimilated form, and it was esti- 
mated I6V2 additional pounds of nitro- 
gen were added to the soil together with 
organic matter. This organic matter im- 
proves the physical condition of the soil, 
permits greater infiltration of rainfall, 
and prevents or greatly diminishes soil 
loss dut tf> \y:]\cr erosion at the most 
critical period of the year. 



THE VITAMIN A POTENCY OF CREAMERY BUTTER PRODUCED IN MISS.

Erosion 

Russell Woodburn reports that tests at 
the Mississippi Station show an average 
loss of 83 tons of soil per acre on a bare 
plot on a 9 percent slope over a 3-year 
period. A maximum loss of 141 tons 
per acre or almost one inch of soil oc- 
curred in 1944 due to the severe rainfall. 
A cotton plot nearby on a slope of 10 
percent, with winter vetch cover, lost 25 
tons per acre in 1944. This loss was 
almost entirely during the cotton season 
from April 1 to October 1. Of further 
interest is the fact that turning under 
vetch on other experimental plots permit- 
ted ten times more soil loss during the 
1944 cotton season than disking in. While 
the plot having the disked vetch lost 
2.3 tons of soil per acre from April to 
October, the bare plot lost 83 tons dur- 
ing the same period. 

Physical Condition of the Cow 

Kuhlman, of the Oklahoma Station, 
states that many dairy cattle in the South 
receive rations so low in carotene that 
normal functional performance cannot 
be attained. This is due to the feeding 



of large quantities of low grade hay, cot- 
tonseed hulls, and lack of good silage. 
The Oklahoma Station states that 40 to 
45 micrograms of carotene per pound 
body weight is about the minimum 
amount which will meet the daily re- 
quirements of cows of the Jersey breed, 
permit normal calving and the initiation 
of a normal lactation period. When the 
carotene intake fell below this point dur- 
ing the last 90 days before calving, many 
of the calves were either dead or very 
weak at birth, the cows developed symp- 
toms of vitamin A deficiency, and some 
indication of a shortened gestation pe- 
riod was noted.

Cotton Variety Tests in the Yazoo- 
Mississippi Delta, 1943-45 

By J. WINSTON NEELY and SIDNEY G. BRAIN 
Delta Branch Experiment Station, Stoneville 



For many years the Delta Branch Sta- 
tion has been testing varieties of cotton 
at Stoneville and on selected plantations 
in other representative sections of the 
Yazoo-Mississippi Delta in an effort to 
evaluate the performance of the various 
cottons under as nearly as possible the 
same conditions that they are to be 
grown by Delta planters. 

It has been the policy of the station to, 
adapt the variety tests to the current needs 
of producers, buyers, spinners, weavers, 
and oil-mill operators for information 
relative to the characteristics of varieties. 
During the time that the boll weevil was 
first becoming a factor in production, in- 
formation was obtained regarding the 
relative boll-weevil tolerance of cotton 
varieties because of earliness. When 
pathogenic wilt became a production fac- 
tor in some parts of the Delta, informa- 
tion was provided regarding the relative 
wilt resistance of the different varieties. 

At the present time cotton mills are 
paying a great deal of attention to ten- 
sile strength of fiber and fiber length uni- 
formity, since these characteristics, along 
with length, give an indication of the 
resulting manufacturing quality of the 
cotton. The current report is the third 
from the Delta Station in which tensile 
strength of fiber and fiber length uni- 
formity for each of the varieties grown 
at each of the locations have been re- 
ported. 

As additional information relative to 
the characteristics of cotton varieties is 
required, the tests will be planned to 
supply as much of this information as 
possible. 

During the past 3 years, the follow- 
ing characteristics of the most common- 



ly planted varieties have been determin- 
ed: (1) Yield of seed cotton, (2) yield 
of lint, (3) gin turn-out, (4) staple 
length, (5) size of boll, (6) earliness, 
(7) fiber tensile strength, (8) length uni- 
formity of fiber, and (9) money value 
per acre. 

The yields of seed cotton are based 
upon the weights harvested from ten, 
one-row plots at each location each sea- 
son. 

The yields of lint are based upon the 
respective yields of seed cotton and gin 
turn-outs. 

Gm turn-out values were determined 
by ginning ten, lOO-boU samples which 
were picked from each variety at each 
location during each of the three sea- 
sons. 

The staple lengths of each variety at 
each location were determined by class- 
ers of the Staple Cotton Cooperative As- 
sociation, Greenwood, Mississippi, and 
of the Greenwood office of the Board of 
Cotton Examiners, Production and Mar- 
keting Administration, of the U. S. De- 
partment of Agriculture. 

The sizes of boll are based upon the 
average weight of ten, lOO-boU samples 
from each variety at each location. 

The percentage of cotton obtained from 
the first picking, which is considered a 
measure of earliness, was determined by 
dividing the weight of the first picking 
by the weight of the total production. 

The fiber tensile strength and the 
length uniformity of fiber were de- 
termined in the Stoneville Fiber Labora- 
tory of the Production and Marketing 
Administration. 

The money values per acre are based 
upon: (1) Yields of seed and lint, (2)

staple lengths, and (3) seed grades. The 
values for three grades — Middling, Strict 
Low Middling, and Low Middling — are 
given. The average prices for cotton of 
the respective grades and several lengths 
for 10 weeks of the 1945 marketing sea- 
son in Memphis were used. The seed 
were evaluated on a basis of $56 per ton, 
with premiums and discounts in accord- 
ance with official standards for grading 
cottonseed set up by the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. The seed analyses 
were made in the Stoneville Laboratory 
of the Production and Marketing Ad- 
ministration of the U. S. Department of 
Agriculture. 

The current report is divided into two 
parts: (1) The 1945 tests, and (2) the 
1943 to 1945 tests. 

Results of the 1945 Tests 

During the 1945 season the Delta 
Branch Experiment Station conducted 
cotton variety tests at the following lo- 
cations in the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta: 
Stoneville, Jonestown, Money, Heathman, 
Valley Hill, Yazoo City, and Kelso. 

Excessive amounts of rainfall during 
the planting, growing, and harvesting 



seasons occurred at all locations. 
Stoneville Test 

The Stoneville test was located at the 
Delta Branch Experiment Station and 
was conducted in cooperation with the 
late J. W. Whitaker, county agent of 
Washington County. The soil is a sandy 
loam, typical of banks along upper Deer 
Creek. A nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded on" about 2 weeks before plant- 
ing. The test was planted on April 27. 
The first picking was made on Septem- 
ber 18, and the second and third pickings 
were made on October 11 and December 
7, respectively. Results of the 1945 
Stoneville tests are given in table 1. 

When comparisons are based upon 
MiddHng grade, the following varieties 
were leading money-value producers: 
Delfos 9169, Coker 100-9, Stoneville 2B, 
Coker 100-S'taple Strain 1, and Delfos 
444. If comparisons are made on the 
basis of Strict Low Middling grade, the 
leading varieties are Delfos 9169, Stone- 
ville 2B, Coker 100-9, Coker 100-Staple 
Strain 1, Miller, and Bobshaw 1. The 
following varieties are leading money- 
value producers when comparisons are

Stoneville 2B, Delfos 9169, Coker 100-9, 
Miller, Bobshaw 1, and Coker 100-Sta- 
ple Strain 1. 

Jonestown Test 

The Jonestown test was conducted in 
cooperation with Carey Cocke, Jr., farm 
operator, and Harris Barnes, county 
agent of Coahoma County. The test is 
located on the Eagle Nest Plantation west 
of Jonestown. The soil is a sandy loam 
and is well drained. A nitrogenous fer- 
tilizer was "bedded on" and the test 
planted on May 11. The first and sec- 
ond pickings were made on October 18 
and February 21, respectively. The 
plants were rank. There was a light 
boll-weevil infestation and considerable 
boll rot. Pathogenic wilt killed a few 
plants but probably was of no conse- 
quence. There was some falling out of 
cotton between the first and last pick- 
ings, but very little difference in this 
respect between varieties was noted. The 
results of the tests conducted at Jones- 
town in 1945 are given in table 2. 

The upper money value producing 
group includes Delfos 9169, Bobdel, 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Bobshaw 1, 



Delfos 531C, and Miller when compari- 
sons are made on the basis of Middling 
grade. Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Bobshaw 1, 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Miller, and 
Delfos 531C are leading money-value 
producers in the Strict Low Middling 
comparisons. Delfos 9169, Bobshaw 1, 
Bobdel, Miller, and Coker 100-Staple 
Strain 1 lead in regard to money value 
per acre when comparisons are based 
upon the Low Middling grade. 

Money Test 
In cooperation with H. L. Gary, presi- 
dent of Wildwood, Incorporated, and J. 
S. McBee, county agent of Leflore Coun- 
ty, a test was conducted near Money on 
the east banks of the Tallahatchie River. 
The soil is a fine, sandy loam and is well 
drained. A nitrogenous fertilizer was 
"bedded on" before planting. The test 
was planted on April 19. "Damping 
off" of seedlings resulted in irregular 
stands, but apparently none of the vari- 
eties were discriminated against because 
of poor stands. The first picking was 
made on September 28 and the second 
picking on November 23. The results 
of the 1945 Money tests are given in 
table 3.

of Bobshaw Chemurgic Plantation, and 
H. A. Carpenter, county agent. The 
field is located on Highway 82. The 
soil is a light colored, well drained, silt 
loam. A nitrogenous fertilizer was "bed- 
ded on" before planting. The test was 
planted on May 5. Stands were irregular 
due to "damping off," but apparently 
none of the varieties were discriminated 
against because of poor stands. Boll- 
weevil infestations were heavy. The first 
picking was made on September 24 and 
the second picking on November 28. The 
results of the Heathman test are given 
in table 4. 

When comparisons were made upon 
the basis of Middling or Strict Low Mid- 
dling grades, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, 
Delfos 53 IC, and Delfos 444 were lead- 
ing money-value-per-acre producers. Cok- 
er 100-Staple Strain 1, Delfos 444, Delfos 
531C, Delfos 9169, and Stoneville 2B 
produced significantly higher money val- 
ues per acre than did the other varieties 
when comparisons were based upon Low 
Middling grade. 



Valley Hill Test 

In cooperation with L. S. Hemphill, 
landowner, and R. A. Cooper, county 
agent, a test was conducted at Valley 
Hill in Carroll County about 6 miles 
east of Greenwood on Highway 82. The 
test is on the eastern border of the Delta. 
The surface soil is a light colored, well 
drained, silt loam made up of outwash 
from the hills. A nitrogeous fertilizer 
was "bedded on" before planting. The 
test was planted on May 23. An earlier 
planting on April 20 failed to give suf- 
ficient stands. Pathogenic wilt was very 
bad. Delfos 651, Delfos 444, Delfos 
531C, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, and 
Coker 100-9 were the most susceptible 
varieties. Miller and Bobshaw I were 
the most resistant varieties. Boll-weevil 
infestations were very heavy, and losses 
due to weevil were of some consequence, 
particularly in the late varieties. The 
test was picked on October 19. Earliness 
data are not available. The results of the 
1945 Valley Hill test are given in table 5. 

Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Miller, Bobshaw 
I, and Coker 100-Staple Strain 1 were

leading money-value producers when 
comparisons were made upon the basis 
of Middling grade. 

When comparisons were made on the 
basis of Strict Low Middling or Middling 
grades, Delfos 9169, Bobdel, Miller, and 
Bobshaw 1 were leading money-value- 
per-acre producers. 

Yazoo City Test 

The Yazoo City test was conducted on 
the Marx Schaefer farm 3 miles west of 
Yazoo City in cooperation with Mr. 
Schaefer and with A. R. Ruby, county 
agent of Yazoo County. The soil is a 
fine sandy loam and is well drained. A 
nitrogenous fertilizer was "bedded on" 
and the test planted on April 12. There 
was considerable "damping off" of seed- 
lings, but the stands were fairly good. 
The plants grew tall, and the foliage was 
very heavy. Boll rot and boll-weevil in- 
festations were very bad. The test was 
picked on September 26 and again on 
November 29. Results of the Yazoo 
City test are given in table 6. 

Leading money-value producers were 
Coker 100-Staple Strain 1, Delfos 9169^ 



Deltapine 14, Bobshaw I, Delfos 444, 
Delfos 531C, Delfos 651, and Stonevilk 
2B when comparisons are made on the 
basis of Middling grade. Delfos 9169. 
Deltapine 14, Coker 100-Staple Strain 1. 
Bobshaw 1, Delfos 444, Stoneville 2B. 
Delfos 531C, and Delfos 651 lead in re- 
gard to money value per acre when com 
parisons are based upon Strict Low Mid- 
dling grade. When comparisons are 
based upon Low Middling grade, tht 
following varieties were the leading 
money-value producers: Deltapine 14. 
Delfos 9169, Bobshaw 1, Coker 100- 
Staple Strain 1, Stoneville 2B, Delfos 
444, and Delfos 531C. 

Kelso Test 

The Kelso test was conducted in co- 
operation with James Hand of Kelso 
Plantation and C. L. Cary, county agent 
of Sharkey County. It is located on the 
Sharkey-Issaquena county line 11 miles 
south of Cary on Highway 61. The 
soil is a sandy loam and is well drained. 
The test was planted in check rows on 
April 17. The rows were 40 inches apart 
each way. Six plants were left in each

hill. The plants grew very tall, and the 
foliage vva.s very heavy. Boll-weevil in 
festations were bad. The entire produc- 
tion was picked on October 16. EarH- 
ness data were not obtained. Results of 
the 1945 Kelso test are given in table 7. 

Delfos 53 IC, Stoneville 2B, Delfos 444, 
Cooker 100-9, Delfos 651, Coker 100- 
Staple Strain 1, and Delfos 9169 were 
leading money-value-per-acre producers 
when comparisons were nnade on the 
basis of Middling and Strict Low Mid- 
dling grades. When comparisons were 
made on the basis of Low Middling 
grade, Stoneville 2B,' Delfos 531C, Del- 
fos 444, Coker 100-9, Delfos 651, Delfos 
9169, and Bobshaw 1 were leading 
money-value-per-acre producers. 

Results From 2- and 3-Year 
Variety Studies 

Seasonal conditions have a marked ef- 
fect upon the yield and other character- 
istics of cotton varieties. For this rea- 
son, data from a variety study conducted 
for only one season are probably not in- 
dicative of long-time performance. The 
results obtained by averaging the data 



obtained by conducting variety teste over 
a period of years provide much more 
useful information. 

Variety tests similar to those describ- 
ed above were conducted during the 3 
years 1943 to 1945 at Stoneville, Money, 
Heathman, Valley Hill, and Yazoo City, 
and during the years 1944 and 1945 at 
Kelso. Only 10 varieties were common 
to tests grown during all of the seasons. 

Methods of conducting the tests, col 
lecting samples, and analyzing data are 
the same as outlined for the 1945 tests. 
Dates of planting and picking at the 
different locations in 1943 and 1944 are 
given in bulletins 398 and 416 of the 
Mississippi Agricultural Experiment Sta- 
tion. The, dates for the 1945 tests were 
given earlier in this report. 

The 1943 and 1944 growing seasons in 
the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta were char- 
acterized by marked deficiencies of soil 
moisture during the boll-maturation per- 
iod. The staple lengths of all varieties 
were shorter than normal, and the 
lengths of Bobdel, Coker 100, and the 
Delfos strains were affected more by dry

weather than were the lengths of the 
slower maturing varieties. Excessive 
amounts of rainfall during the planting, 
growing, and harvesting seasons occurred 
at ail locations in 1945. 

The yields of seed cotton and lint, gin 
turn-out, staple length, boll size, earli- 
ness, fiber tensile strength, uniformity of 
fiber length, and total money values, 
based upon Middling, Strict Low Mid- 
dling, and Low Middling, are given in 
tables 8 to 13 for the respective locations. 

The yields of seed cotton were deter- 
mined by averaging the seed cotton yields 
obtained during each of the seasons that 
the tests were conducted at a given loca- 
tion. 

The yield of lint was obtained by mul- 
tiplying the average gin turn-out by the 
average yield of seed cotton per acre. 

The gin turn-out data presented in 
each table were obtained by determining 
the mean lint percentages of 30 samples 
for each variety for the 3-year tests and of 
20 samples for the 2-year tests. 

The staple length, the number of bolls 
required for a pound of seed cotton, the 
percent of seed cotton picked during the 
first picking, the fiber tensile strength, 
and the fiber length uniformity ratio, 
were determined by averaging the values 
obtained for each variety during the sea- 
sons that the tests were conducted at a 



given location. 

The total money values per acre were 
obtained by using the average yields of 
seed cotton and lint, the average staple 
length for the 2- or 3-year period, the 
average seed grade for 1944 and 1945, 
and the price of Unt for the respective 
grades and lengths for 1945. 

During the 3-year period 1943 to 1945, 
the leading money value producing va- 
rieties at Stoneville were Stoneville 2B, 
Deltapine 14, and Coker 100. 

At Money the leading money-value 
producers were Stoneville 2B, Deltapine 
14, and Bobshaw 1. 

The leading money-value producers at 
Heathman, based on the 3-year averages, 
were Stoneville 2B and Deltapine 14. 

Stoneville 2B, Miller, Bobshaw 1, and 
Deltapine 14 were leading money-value 
producers at Valley Hill during the 3- 
year period. 

The total money values produced by 
Deltapine 14, Stoneville 2B, and Bob- 
shaw 1 were higher than the values pro- 
duced by the other seven varieties at 
Yazoo City during the years 1943 to 
1945. 

At Kelso the leading money-value pro- 
ducing varieties during the 2-year period 
1944 to 1945 were Delfos 53 IC, Coker 
100, and Stoneville 2B.
