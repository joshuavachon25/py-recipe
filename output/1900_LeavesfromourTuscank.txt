PREFACE 

The innate love of change in man is visible 
even in the kitchen. Not so very long ago 
soup was an exception in English houses — 
almost a luxury. A dish of vegetables — as a 
dish and not an adjunct to meat — was a still 
greater rarity; and even now plain -boiled 
potatoes, peas, cabbages, etc., are the rule. 
When we read of the dishes, fearfully and 
wonderfully made, in the old Italian novelUy 
we wonder whence the present Italians got 
their love of vegetables and maccaroni. 

Sacchetti tells us that in the fourteenth cen- 
tury a baked goose, stuffed with garlic and 
quinces, was considered an exquisite dish ; and 
when the gonfalonier of Florence gave a 
supper to a famous doctor, he put before him 
the stomach of a calf, boiled partridges, and 
pickled sardines. Gianfigliazzi's cook sent up 
a roasted crane to his master as a delicacy, says

Boccaccio; and a dish of leeks cooked with 
spices appears as a special dish in the rules of 
the chapter of San Lorenzo when the canons 
messed together. Old Laschi, author of that 
delightful book UOsservatore Fiorentinoy moral- 
ises on the ancient fashion of cooking in his 
pleasant rather prosy way : ' It would not seem 
that the senses should be subjected to fashion ; 
and yet such is the case. The perfumes, once 
so pleasing, musk, amber, and benzoin, now 
excite convulsions; sweet wines, such as Pis- 
ciancio, Verdea, Montalcino, and others men- 
tioned by Redi in his dithyrambic, are now 
despised ; and instead of the heavy dishes of 
olden times, light and elegant ones are in 
vogue. Whoever characterised man as a 
laughing animal ought rather to have called 
him a variable and inconstant one.' 

The dinner which set all Siena laughing for 
days, given to a favourite of Pius ii. by a 
Sienese who substituted wild geese for pea- 
cocks, after cutting ofF their beaks and feet, 
and coloured his jelly with poisonous ingre- 
dients, forms the subject of one of Pulci's 
tales : — 

* Meanwhile it was ordered that hands should 
be washed, and Messer Goto was seated at the

head of the table, and then other courtiers who 
had accompanied him ; and they ate many tarts 
of good almond paste as a beginning. Then 
was brought to Messer Goro the dish on which 
were the peacocks without beaks, and a fellow 
was told to carve them. He not being used to 
such office gave himself vast trouble to pluck 
them,^ but did it with so little grace that he 
filled the room and all the table with feathers, 
and the eyes, the mouth, the nose, and the ears 
of Messer Goro, and of them all. They, per- 
ceiving that it was from want of knowledge, 
held their peace, and took a mouthful here and 
there of other dishes so as not to disturb the 
order of the feast. But they were always 
swallowing dry feathers. Falcons and hawks 
would have been convenient that evening. 
When this pest had been removed many other 
roasts were brought, but all most highly 
seasoned with cumin. Everything would how- 
ever have been pardoned if at the last an 
error had not been committed, which out of 
sheer folly nearly cost Messer Goro and those 

* Peacocks were skinned, not plucked, before cooking, 
and the skin with the feathers was put on to the roasted 
bird, and the tail opened out before placing the dish on 
the table. The * fellow ' ought to have cut the stitches 
and drawn off the skin, instead of plucking the feathers.

with him their lives. Now you must know 
that the master of the house and his coun- 
cillors, in order to do honour to his guest, had 
ordered a dish of jelly. They wanted, as is 
the fashion in Florence and elsewhere, to have 
the arms of the Pope and of Messer Goro with 
many ornaments on it ; so they used orpiment, 
white and red lead, verdigris and other horrors, 
and set this before Messer Goro as a choice 
and new thing. And Messer Goro and his 
companions ate willingly of it to take the 
bitter taste of the cumin and the other 
strange dishes out of their mouths, thinking, 
as is the custom in every decent place, that 
they were all coloured with saffron, milk of 
sweet almonds, the juices of herbs, and such 
like. And in the night it was just touch 
and go that some of them did not stretch 
out their legs. Messer Goro especially suf- 
fered much anguish from both head and 
stomach. . . .*^ 

A company of Lombard pastrycooks came to 
Tuscany in the sixteenth century, and intro- 
duced fine pastry into Florence. We find the 
first mention of it in Berni's Orlando InnamoratOj 
where it is mentioned among the choice viands.

PREFACE 



XI 



Laschi says, ^the epoch of Charles v. is the 
greatest of modern times, for the culture of 
the spirit induced the culture of the body.* 
But he does not mention vegetables or herbs at 
all. For them we must go back to the ancients. 
Bitterly did the Israelites, when wandering in 
the desert, regret 'the cucumbers and the 
melons we did eat in Egypt'; though old 
Gerardc says, *they yield to the body a cold 
and moist nourishment, and that very little, 
and the same not good.' Gerarde is however 
hard to please, for he says of egg-plants, under 
the old English name of Raging or Mad Apples, 
'doubtless these apples have a mischievous 
qualitie, the use whereof is utterly to be for- 
saken.' 

Fennel, dedicated to St. John, was believed 
to make the lean fat and to give the weak 
strength, while the root pounded with honey 
was considered a remedy against the bites of 
mad dogs. If lettuce be eaten after dinner it 
cures drunkenness ; but Pope says : — 

If your wish be rest, 
Lettuce and cowslip wine, probatum est. 

Sorrel is under the influence of Venus, and 
Gerarde declares that also ' the carrot serveth

for love matters; and Orpheus, as Pliny 
writeth, said that the use hereof winneth love.* 
Flowers of rosemary, rue, sage, marjoram, 
fennel, and quince preserve youth ; worn over 
the heart they give gaiety. Rosemary is an 
herb of the sun, while Venus first raised sweet 
marjoram, therefore young married couples are 
crowned with it in Greece. While 

* He that eats sage in May 
Shall live for aye.' * 

Sweet basil is often worn by the Italian maidens 
in their bosoms, as it is supposed to engender 
sympathy, and borage makes men merry and 
joyful. 

For years English friends have begged recipes 
for cooking vegetables in the Italian fashion, 
so I have written down many of the following 
from the dictation of our good Giuseppe 
Volpi, whose portrait, by Mr. A. H. Hallam 
Murray, adorns this little book, and who has 
been known to our friends for over thirty 
years 

I must also acknowledge, with thanks, the

ITALIAN RECIPES 

INTRODUCTION 

^hout the cooking of Vegetables. 

Vegetables should be well washed in cold 
water to remove insects and dust ; if not fresh 
gathered, leave them some time in cold water, 
and remember that they take longer to cook than 
fresh ones. Green vegetables must be put into 
salted water (one tablespoonful of salt to every 
two quarts of water) and rapidly cooked over a 
brisk fire in an open sauce-pan until they are 
tender. All green vegetables should be re- 
moved from the water as soon as cooked, and 
be well drained before adding the seasoning. 

fAhout Sauces. 

So much depends on sauces that only the 
best ingredients should be used in making them. 
Rancid or impure oil or bad butter will ruin 
sauces and salads. Both butter and oil should 
always be tasted before buying, as good cookery 
is impossible unless they are perfectly fresh and 
good in every way ; butter must be added to 
sauces in small bits, or it will form a greasy 
line. To skim sauces, take the sauce-pan

off the fire and put in a teaspoonful of cold 
water, which will make the grease rise. Re- 
member that wine increases the taste of salt, 
so when wine is used in a sauce put in very 
little salt until after the wine has been added. 

^ouf Eggs. 

Eggs must be quite fresh, if they taste of straw 
the sauce will be spoiled. They should therefore 
be broken one at a time into a saucer and exa- 
mined before using. A pinch of salt added to the 
whites of eggs makes them whisk better,and none 
of the yolk must be allowed to get mixed in. 

tAbout Spices. 

The following is a good recipe for the spices 
so necessary in cooking : Half an ounce of 
cloves, two ounces of nutmeg, half an ounce 
of sweet basil, half an ounce of white pepper, 
two ounces of cinnamon, one quarter of an 
ounce of dried bay leaves, half an ounce of 
thyme. Pound well together, then pass through 
a sieve, and put them into a bottle, or box, 
hermetically closed to preserve the perfume. 

Mout a Bouquet. 

Take one bay leaf, one sprig of thyme, two 
cloves, and one stalk of well- washed celery, place 
round these six sprigs of parsley, fold and tie 
them so that the cloves, etc., cannot fall out.

tAbout Onion Juice. 

Onion juice is obtained by grating an onion 
on a coarse grater, after peeling it Press hard, 
and each stroke will give one drop of juice. 

tAbout Maccaroni and Spaghetti Paste. 

For every quarter of a pound of flour use 
one egg and two tablespoonfiils of warm salted 
water. Take as much flour as needful, make a 
hole in the centre, and put in the water and the 
eggs. Beat them up with a spoon, mixing the 
flour in gradually, then knead well. Roll the 
paste into very thin sheets, and place them on 
a clean cloth to dry for half an hour. This 
paste will not keep more than one, or one and a 
half days, and must always be put into boiling 
water or broth to cook. If soaked before cook- 
ing the flavour is spoiled. 

t^bout blanching Maccaroni and Spaghetti. 

Put an earthenware pot, filled with water, on 
the fire, add two tablespoonfuls of salt, and boil. 
Put in three-quarters of a pound of fresh mac- 
caroni, twisting it round carefully so as not to 
break it. Boil for seventeen minutes, then 
remove from the fire ; drain, and put it in cold 
water; drain again, and it is ready for use. 
Spaghetti are blanched the same way.

tAbout CroHtons. 

To make croutons, cut bread into whatever 
shape you want. Take off the crust, dip the 
pieces into melted butter, and toast in the oven, 
turn often in order to colour evenly, or fiy 
them in boiling oil or fat. They must be 
crisp and of a light brown colour. 

tAiout a Bain-Marie. 

A Bain-Marie is a large copper pan placed 
on the fire, and containing boiling water in 
which are put smaller pans with anything to 
be kept hot, or cooked without boiling. Milk 
is better cooked in Bain-Marie, than in a sauce- 
pan on the fire-
