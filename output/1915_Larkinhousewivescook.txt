To the woman who takes pride in 
serving tasty and attractive dishes, 
who delights in placing on her table 
"Good Things to Eat," who wishes to 
have the means of "variety" ever at her 
command, this Cook Book will be a valu- 
able and constant adviser. 

It is interesting to note that it contains 
recipes from the North, South, East and 
West; the favorite recipes of practical 
and e^xperienced housewives. No recipes 
were accepted from professional cooks 
but all from the homes of our many 
customers. We believe that this book 
will prove unique on account of the 
immense variety given. 

Here will be found an answer to the 
question that is ever perplexing the house- 
wife — what to serve for the coming meal. 
Here she will find most valuable sugges- 
tions that will enable her to prepare, in 
great variety and in a practical and 
economical way, delicious and appetizing 
dishes that will be a source of real satis- 
faction and extreme delight to those in 
her home who truly appreciate "Good 
Things to Eat."

And health on both!"

Level Measurements Only Are Used In These Recipes 

Flour, meal, powdered sugar and soda should be sifted before 
measuring. A cupful is measured level ; do not shake down. 

A cup, as used in these recipes, holds one-half pint 
(two gills) of liquid, or one-half pound of granulated 
sugar or butter. A tin or glass measuring-cup, divided 
into quarters and thirds, can be purchased at any 
house-furnishing store for ten cents. 

To measure a level tablespoon or teaspoon, make smooth 
with a knife but do not pat down. 

A half spoonful is ' measured by cutting in half 
lengthwise ; a fourth spoonful by cutting a half spoon- 
ful crosswise a little nearer the handle of the spoon. 

A "pinch" is as much as you can hold between 
the first finger and thumb. 

A family scale is a great convenience, both for 
use in cooking and for weighing purchases.

Rules for Testing and 
Using Fat for Frying 




To Test Fat for Frying 

1. Drop a piece of soft bread into the hot fat; if the bread 
browns in forty seconds, the temperature is right for any cooked 
mixture. 

2. Use the same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one 
minute for bread to brown. Fresh fat or oil should be used for 
batter and dough mixtures. It can then be used for fish, meat 
and croquettes, but should be frequently clarified. 

To Clarify 

Melt fat, add raw potato cut in small pieces, heat the fat 
gradually ; when fat ceases to bubble and potatoes are well browned, 
strain through double cheese-cloth. The potato absorbs any 
odors or gases and collects some of the sediment. The remaining 
sediment will settle in the bottom of the pan. When you have 
only a small amount of fat to be clarified, add boiling water to the 
cold fat, stir vigorously and set aside to cool; the fat will float to 
the top and the sediment can be scraped from the bottom. 

To Try Out Fat 

Any odd pieces of fat may be tried out more easily in a double 
sauce-pan than by putting into the oven; it will then take less 
watching. 

Sauteing 

Saut^ing is frying in a small quantity of fat. In many cases 
the word saute might be used in this book but is not, as the word 
is not generally understood, so we have used the more common 
word "fry," which really means cooking in deep fat. All foods 
when fried should be drained on soft paper. 

Fricasseeing 

Fricasseeing is sauteing and cooking in a sauce. 

To Egg and Crumb 

Before frying, dip the mixture in bread-crumbs, then In the 
egg, then again in the crumbs. One tablespoon of cold water 
may be used with the egg to good advantage. 

To prepare the crumbs put stale bread, thoroughly dried out, 
through the food-chopper, using the fine or coarse cutter according 
to the kind of crumbs required. 




THE cheaper cuts of beef are best suited for the making of soup 
— the vein, neck, flank, cheek and shin. Though quite tough 
and sinewy they are full of nutriment and flavor. 

Water cannot dissolve the fiber of the beef, so we therefore 
always remove the beef from the soup and make it over into meat 
dishes. The bones from roasts or poultry, or part of the steak 
from dinner, should all be put into a kettle, covered with cold water 
and simmered until the goodness is cooked out. Never boil soup- 
meat of any kind, for boiling hardens the meat without drawing out 
the goodness. Be quite sure to have a lid that closely fits the soup 
kettle or much of the goodness and flavor will pass off in the steam. 

To Make Meat Soups 

Wipe meat with clean cloth wrung out of cold water. Cut the 
lean meat in small pieces. By doing so a larger amount of 
surface is exposed to the water and the juices are readily drawn 
out. Always cover soup-meat with cold water and bring slowly 
to the boiling-point. If a portion of the meat is browned before 
adding water, the soup will have a richer flavor. 

To Bind Soups 

Cream soups and purees (purees are soups with the vegetables 
strained out or forced through a sieve) if allowed to stand, will 
separate, unless bound together. To bind a soup melt some 
butter, add an equal amount of flour and when mixed add a 
small quantity of the soup; then add to the remainder of the 
soup. In this way lumps will be avoided. 

To Prevent Cream of Tomato Soup Curdling 

Put soda with the tomato, allowing one-fourth teaspoon soda to 
two cups of tomatoes, then add to the thickened milk, stirring 
all the time. If you wish to keep the soup hot for a while, 
leave it in the separate sauce-pans and do not add the soda 
until ready to serve. 

Croutons to Serve with Soup 

These are made by cutting stale bread into thin slices. Remove 
the crust, spread with butter and bake until crisp and brown, 
or brown in the frying pan.

iron pan very hot, rub it quickly with suet, then put in the 

steak. Never put the fork into the lean meat, always in the 

fat. Just as soon as one side is seared, turn over; turn several 

times in cooking; add pepper and salt; serve on a hot dish at 

once. J „ 

Larkin Kitchen. 

To Broil Steak 

See that the fire is bright and clear, put the steak on the grid- 
iron, turn often and allow time according to the thickness of 
steak; dust with pepper and salt and serve very hot. Steak 
to be good should never stand after being cooked. 

Larkin Kitchen. 

To Broil with Gas 

Light the gas in the oven at least five minutes before you wish 

to use it. Take out the rack or the meat will stick to the 

bars if very hot; leave in the lower pan. Put the steak on the 

rack as near the flame as you can without the flame touching. 

As soon as the steak is thoroughly seared, turn the meat over; 

be careful not to put the fork into the lean of the meat as that 

allows the juices to escape; turn once more and season liberally 

with salt and pepper. Drain off some of the fat in broiling 

pan and pour the remainder with the sediment over the steak. 

Serve at once. , t^

a piece of celery, carrot, onion and bay leaf if liked; if cooked 

slowly no water will be needed. Pour off some of the fat and

To Roast Poultry 

One rule will apply to all poultry. 

Have oven very hot until skin is browned, then cool, and if 
poultry is stuffed, cook twenty minutes to the pound; unstufled, 
fifteen minutes. Salt pork is very nice to use for basting pur-

To Boil Cabbage 

Cut a small head of cabbage into four parts, cutting down 
through the stalk. Soak for half an hour in a pan of cold water 
to which has been added a tablespoon of salt — this is to draw 
out any insects that may be hidden in the leaves. Take from 
the water and cut into slices. Have a large stew-pan half 
full of boiling water; put in the cabbage, pushing it under the 
water with a spoon. Add one tablespoon of salt and cook from 
twenty-five to forty-five minutes, depending upon the age of 
the cabbage. Turn into a colander and drain for about two 
minutes. Put into a chopping bowl and mince. Season with 
butter, pepper, and more salt if required. Allow a tablespoon 
of butter to a generous pint of the cooked vegetable. Cabbage 
cooked in this manner will be of delicate flavor and may be 
generally eaten without distress. Have the kitchen windows 
open at the top while the cabbage is boiling and there will be 
little if any odor of cabbage in the house. Parkin Kitchen. 

Cabbeige Germain Style

light, add a cup of sour cream, and a little sugar. Mix with 
the cabbage; do not let it boil or the egg will curdle. Serve

Easy Mayonnaise 

I have discovered that when oil dressing is made in the following 
manner it never fails. To the yolks of two fresh eggs, add one 
tablespoon vinegar, beat well, then add one-fourth teaspoon 
salt and one-half cup or more Larkin Olive Oil; beat constantly 
while pouring it in. The old-fashioned way is to drop the oil 
in very slowly but if the vinegar is added to the eggs first, the 
oil may be poured in much faster, and the mayonnaise will never 
curdle. Season with Larkin Celery Salt, Larkin Onion Extract, 
Mustard or any other seasoning you prefer. 

Mrs. Melvin Smith, Avon, N. Y. 
Crecimy Salad Dressing 

Put into a double sauce-pan four lightly-beaten eggs, and one- 
half cup each of vinegar and water. Stir over the fire until thick, 
then add one-half cup butter. Mix together one teaspoon each 
of Larkin Mustard and sugar and a pinch of white or cayenne 
pepper. Add a spoonful of the cooked dressing to these season- 
ings and stir until smooth. Add balance of dressing and thor- 
oughly mix. Thin with milk or cream as needed. Use more 
vinegar if liked quite sour. Whipped cream folded into this 
makes a very light dressing for salad. This will keep for weeks 
in a Mason jar if screwed down tight and left in a cool place. 

Mrs. Eva S. Pugh, Brownell, Kans. 

Sue's Salad Dressing 

Mix one teaspoon Larkin Mustard, one teaspoon sugar, and 
the yolks of two eggs. Add one-half cup vinegar and cook until 
thick. Then fold in the stifily-beaten whites of two eggs. 
Cook for two minutes, cool, thin out with milk or cream as 
needed. The beaten whites insure a light, fluffy dressing.

Peanut Dressing 

Mix together in a small bowl two tablespoons Larkin Peanut 
Butter, two tablespoons lemon juice, two tablespoons cold 
water, one teaspoon Larkin Salad Dressing and one-eighth

Vinegar. If the oil floats, too much vinegar has been used.

To Boil Eggs 

Eggs are cooked in many ways, but for cooking in the shell 
there is no better way than to put the egg into one pint of 
boiling water, cover, stand in a warm place, leave for six minutes, 
when the eggs will be cooked through, but soft; if liked very 
soft, allow less time. Be sure to have enough water, according 
to the number of eggs; if two eggs are needed use one quart of 
water, and so on accordingly. To cook eggs hard leave them 
in the water for thirty-five minutes. Then put them in cold 
water for five minutes. Larkin Kitchen. 

To Turn and Fold an Omelet 

Tip pan so as to bring one side of omelet higher than the other. 
Place spatula under higher side and tipping pan to almost a 
vertical position, carefully fold over. If a half-inch cut is first 
made at each end of fold, the omelet folds more easily and with- 
out breaking. Larkin Kitchen. 

Poached Eggs 

Have a shallow pan nearly full of boiling salted water, remove 
scum and reduce temperature until water is motionless; break 
an egg into a saucer and slip into the water; when a film has 
formed over the yolk and the white is firm, take up with a 
skimmer and place on toast which has been trimmed into shape. 
A much easier way is to use Larkin Double-Boiler and Egg- 
Poacher which poaches five eggs at one time. larkin Kitchen. 

French Omelet 

To four eggs allow three-fourths cup cold water, — salt and 
pepper to taste. Beat the eggs very light, then add the water 
and thoroughly mix. Pour into hot greased frying pan, run 
spatula around the edges and lift slightly to allow the thin 
part to run underneath. Serve at once on a hot platter.

place in a hot oven and cook until just setting; fold over and 
turn onto a hot platter. If your oven is not hot turn the omelet 
carefully over and finish cooking on top of stove. Minced ham,

ACARONI AND 
CHEESE DISHES 




Macaroni is an excellent food, wholesome, delicious and 
digestible. Larkin Macaroni contains a large amount of nutri- 
ment in the form of starch, protein, and mineral matter, as only 
the best flour obtainable is used. 

It is thoroughly dried before packaging, so that there is prac- 
tically no loss in weight. It is truly an economical article of diet 
and can be prepared in a great variety of ways. This wholesome 
food should be found more often on our tables. 

If macaroni lacks flavor it is due to improper cooking. Follow 
directions given and so get best results. 

To Cook Macaroni 

Partly fill a large kettle with water, adding one teaspoon salt 
to each quart of water. When boiling, put in the macaroni and 
boil rapidly for twenty-five or thirty minutes. Stir occasionally 
with a spatula or wooden spoon, drain through a colander, rinse 
with cold water, drain again and it is ready for use. 

When Larkin Macaroni is cooked in this way it will be firm and 
white and have a delicious flavor. 

Macaroni may also be cooked in a double-boiler. Allow two 
■cups of boiling salted water to each cup of macaroni. It will 
take thirty minutes to cook. No starch is lost when this method 
is used, as all the water is absorbed by the macaroni. Cheese, 
tomatoes, milk and eggs all combine with macaroni to make 
'delicious dishes. It may also be served plain-boiled with a 
little butter, and used in place of potatoes with any meat.

Custard Macaroni

Bread Made with Compressed Yeast 

Sift together three quarts Larkin Bread Flour, add three tea- 
spoons Larkin Salt, add one cake compressed yeast softened 
in one-third cup of lukewarm water, and one quart cool boiled 
water. Mix thoroughly, sprinkle the bread-board with flour 
and turn dough onto it. Knead until dough ceases to stick 
and is smooth and elastic to the touch. Then put into bread- 
raiser and let raise. It will take about three hours. Divide 
into four parts, mold each into a loaf, place in bread-pans, cover 
with a clean cloth and let raise again until double in bulk. 
Bake forty-five minutes in a moderate oven.

has been softened in one cup lukewarm water. Mix thoroughly 
and stand aside in a fairly warm place for several hours. Use 
one cup yeast to a quart of liquid. If kept air-tight in a cool 
place it will keep good for three or four weeks. 

To make bread take one quart warm liquid, (milk or water), 
and one cup potato yeast. Stir in enough Larkin Flour to 
make a soft batter, set in a warm place to raise; when very

Mrs. J. H. Westman, Strawberry Ridge, Pa, 





There are two classes of cakes — sponge cake, in which no 
butter is used — and butter cakes. Sponge cake includes white, 
yellow and sunshine cake. Examples of butter cakes are: layer, 
cup, pound, etc. 

In making cakes use the best materials. Flour must be sifted 
before measuring. Pastry flour is preferred. If bread flour is 
used, sift two or three times before measuring. Never melt the 
butter, the bowl may be slightly warmed before the butter is 
creamed. Larkin Cooking Oil or part lard and part butter may 
be used with good results. 

Dried fruits should always be cleaned and well floured. Never 
wash currants just before using, or the mixture will be heavy. Add 
fruit at the last moment. If the fruit sinks to the bottom of the 
cake, the batter is too thin. 

In making cake follow this order, first, get out all necessary 
utensils and materials, then ingredients. If using a coal range, 
arrange the dampers so that the oven will be ready by the time 
the cake is mixed. Next prepare the pans, then mix the cake. 
For butter cakes, grease the pan with oil, lard or butter, and dredge 
slightly with flour. For large cakes, line the pan with paper. 

Larkin Kitchen. 

Cakes without Butter 

Sponge and Angel Food Cakes are raised by the air which is 
beaten into the whites of the eggs, and by slowly increasing heat 
of the oven. Care must be taken in combining the ingredients, 
not to stir the mixture or reverse the motion of beating or folding. 

The flour and sugar should be sifted several times before being 
measured. 

These cakes may be baked in ungreased pans if the pans are 
kept exclusively for them. The oven is right for these cakes when 
it turns a piece of white paper a light-brown in five minutes. 

Angel food and sponge cake should be placed in a very slow 
oven, increasing the heat as it bakes, browning at the last.

CAKES AND FROSTINGS 



To Bake Cake 

The oven should not be as hot for cake as for bread. It is 
right for cake baked in loaves if it turns a piece of writing paper a 
light-brown in five minutes. For layer and small cakes it should 
be hotter. 

The time for baking a cake may be divided into four quarters: 
First quarter: The cake rises; little bubbles form on top. 
Second quarter: The cake continues to rise, and it browns 

in spots. 
Third quarter: The cake browns all over. 
Fourth quarter: The cake shrinks from the sides of the 
tin, becomes elastic to the touch, and stops singing. 
During the baking, the oven heat should be increased gradually 
but very slightly until the cake is brown, then it may be slightly 
reduced. On the average a thin loaf will bake in forty minutes, 
while a thick loaf should bake for at least an hour. Fruit cakes 
may require several hours. 

To turn cake out of the pan, loosen around the edges with a 
spatula and slip out on a wire cake-cooler or a clean towel or paper. 
If it sticks, turn it upside down, place damp cloth over the bottom 
of the pan and let it steam for a few minutes. Larkin Kitchen. 

Christmas or Wedding Cake 

One pound of butter, one pound brown sugar, ten eggs, six 
cups flour, one teaspoon each soda and ginger, one tablespoon 
each cloves and nutmeg, two tablespoons cinnamon. One pint 
blackberry jam or molasses, two pounds almonds, one pound 
citron, one pound dates, one pound figs, three pounds raisins, 
and one cup fruit juice, or brandy if you use it. The day before 
baking prepare the fruit, shell and blanch the almonds. The 
next morning beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add yolks 
of eggs beaten light. Then stir the soda into the molasses or 
jam and add next, then add the flour and spices sifted together 
and the fruit juice or brandy. Dredge the fruit well with flour, 
add to the mixture, then the almonds, and fold in last the whites 
of eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Line the pan with heavy well- 
greased paper. Have the citron sliced very thin, put a layer 
of cake batter, then a layer of citron, alternately until all is 
used. This cake fills a pan ten inches in diameter and five 
inches deep. It should be baked six or seven hours in a very 
moderate oven. This is a splendid cake and will keep for 
months. Half the quantities make a large cake. All Larkin 
material used except eggs.

FROZEN DESSERTS 

Frozen desserts are easily and quickly made and are both 
cooling and refreshing. To make the work as easy as possible a 
good freezer, a burlap bag, a wooden mallet or an axe, a dipper or 
sauce-pan, ice and coarse rock salt are needed. 

Put the ice into the bag and crush fine — the freezing will be 
accomplished in much less time if the ice is quite fine. Place can 
containing the mixture in freezer and turn the crank to be sure it 
fits properly, then pack around it solidly with salt and ice, using 
three level measures of ice to one of salt. If only a small amount 
is to be frozen, the ice and salt need not come to the top of the can. 
In winter snow may be used in place of ice. Never have the can 
more than three-fourths full as the mixture increases in bulk during 
freezing, and if the can is overcrowded, the cream will be coarse- 
grained. Turn the crank slowly and steadily to expose as large 
surface of mixture as possible to ice and salt. Never draw off the 
salt water until mixture is frozen, unless it is apt to get into the 
can, because the salt water hastens the freezing. After mixture 
is frozen, draw off the water, remove the dasher, and with a spoon 
pack solidly or place in a mold as preferred, put cork in opening 
in cover and repack, using four level measures of ice to one of salt. 
Place an old piece of carpet over the top. When ready to serve, 
run cool water over the can to wash off salty water. 

ICE-CREAMS AND SHERBETS

Pie-Crust 

Two cups sifted flour, one-half cup lard, one-fourth cup ice- 
water, one-half teaspoon salt. Cut the lard into the flour 
with a knife until thoroughly mixed, then stir in the water. Do 
not touch with the hands until this is done. Turn it on a 
board and roll quite thin using as little flour as possible in the 
rolling; fold and roll out again, and continue the folding and 
rolling for two or three minutes. Everything should be very 
cold and the hands used as little as possible. 

Elizabeth G. Leary, West Chester, Pa. 

Baking Powder Crust 

Sift together two and one-half cups Larkin Flour, one and one- 
half teaspoons baking powder, one-half teaspoon Larkin Salt, 
one-half cup Larkin Corn Starch. Chop in three-fourths cup

add enough cold water to mix to a firm dough. Roll out 
quickly and lightly. Enough for two pies.

Raisin Turnovers 

Two cups Larkin Pastry Flour, three-fourths cup Larkin Pure 
Lard, one-half teaspoon salt, ice-water to mix. Sift flour and 
salt together in a wooden bowl; chop shortening in thoroughly; 
add ice-water to mix. Roll out, fold evenly into three layers; 
turn half around and roll again. Repeat twice. This makes 
it flaky. Cut out with a saucer. Place one tablespoon of 
raisin filling on one-half; prick and turn over the upper half 
and pinch edges together. 

To Make the Raisin Filling: 

Juice and grated rind of one lemon, one cup Larkin Seeded 
Raisins, three Larkin Soda Crackers, one cup Larkin Granu- 
lated Sugar, one egg, two tablespoons cold water. Chop 
raisins and crackers, beat egg and sugar, then mix all together.

CANNED FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLE 



a 




To Can Fruit 

The important points in canning are to have the fruit in good 
condition, the syrup clear, rightly proportioned and boiling 
hot, the jars hot before putting in the fruit and then filled to 
overflowing. Keep jars in hot water until needed to fill, stand 
them in a pan on a folded cloth with a little hot water in the 
pan. A wide-mouthed funnel is a great aid when doing the 
work. Have the covers for the jars in another dish of hot 
water; dip the rubbers as you place them on the jars. 

To can small fruits it is better to put the fruit into jars, then 
pour over the hot syrup and la)^ on the covers but do not screw 
down. Put some slats of wood into a wash-boiler so that the 
jars will stand steady, stand the jars upon them and pour 
enough warm water into the wash-boiler to come about half 
way up. Let the water boil five minutes, then take out the 
jars and screw tight. Always open fruit some time before 
using; the flavor will be much improved by so doing. 

Amount of Sugar 

One pound of sugar to one pint of water is a good general 
rule to follow. 

To Can Pears 

Allow one-fourth pound of sugar to one pint of water. 

To Can Peaches 

Allow one-half pound of sugar to one pint of water. 

To Can Vegetables 

The success of canning vegetables depends chiefly on absolute 
cleanliness. The jars must have glass or metal covers; do not 
use those with porcelain lining. All vegetables must be freshly 

gathered- Larkin Kitchen.

To Can Peas, Lima or Shell Beans 

Fill clean jars with freshly-picked peas, fill each jar with water 
that has been boiled and cooled, adjust rubbers, lay on covers 
(do not screw), arrange them in a wash-boiler as directed for 
fruit and boil continuously for two and one-half hours; lift 
each jar and screw tight without removing the cover. This 
rule will answer for lima and other shell beans. 

Larkin Kitchen. 
To Ccin Corn 

Shave corn from the cob, fill jars and press down with a wooden 

spoon. Be quite sure the jar is full. Seal and stand in Larkin 

Steam Cooker No. 140. Steam for three hours. If you have 

no Steam Cooker, place a rack in wash-boiler and surround 

with cold water. If the corn shrinks and you want to fill up 

the jars do so quickly, screw down and steam a few minutes 

longer. Corn canned in this way will keep indefinitely if 

instructions are observed. t^i, r- r- r> kt ^r

To Can Tomatoes 

Put tomatoes into a wire basket or colander, plunge them into 
boiling water for just a moment, remove skins, cut them in 
half and press out seeds. Put tomatoes into a clean kettle, 
boil for about thirty minutes, stirring frequently. If there 
is much liquid boil a little longer. Then follow instructions 
given for canning fruit. Larkin Kitchen.

Jellies are made of cooked fruit juice and sugar, in nearly all 
cases the proportions being equal. Where failures occur, they 
may usually be traced to the use of too ripe fruit. 

To Prepare Glasses for Jelly 

Wash glasses and put into a kettle of cold water; place on range

minutes. Allow the juice to drip through double cheese-cloth. 
Measure the juice, put an equal quantity of sugar in a granite 
dish in the oven to warm. Stir occasionally. When the juice 
begins to jelly round the edge of the pan, add the sugar, boil 
five minutes, skim and pour into heated jelly glasses. Cover 
and keep in a cold dry place.

after it is on the stove) until it cracks when dropped into cold 
water. When it is almost done it becomes very bubbly. Pour 
it out on a buttered slab and gradually work it into a ball or

red — you will then have gray; when orange use red and yellow; 
when cinnamon use heliotrope; sassafras use very little yellow; 
peppermint use no color. If you do not care to make the 
baskets the recipe is equally good for candies. They may be 
cut in strips or formed into small balls. For a children's party 
the baskets make a delightful decoration or gift especially as 
they are good to eat as well as to look at. 

Mrs. Edward H. Schell, Harrisburg, Pa. 

Fruit Candy 

This is candy you can let the children make. Wash one cup 
each Larkin Figs, Dates and Prunes; add one cup seeded 
raisins and walnut meats. Put all through the food-chopper. 
Mix thoroughly and it is ready to use. Form into small balls, 
dip in melted chocolate and place on waxed paper to dry. 
Cherries, nuts, pieces of candied pineapple may all be used 
for the center; if fillings are used you may then call them Sur- 
prise Balls, others may be dipped in fondant used for making 
candy baskets. This fruit is also delicious as a sandwich 

"'""S- Cecelia Hahn, Wabash, Ind. 

Cream Caramels

one pound Larkin Powdered Sugar, one scant cup milk, one- 
half cup butter. Boil these together from five to eight minutes 
or until the mixture scrapes off white from the side of the pan. 
Take from fire, add one teaspoon vanilla and beat hard until 
it thickens, pour into well-greased pan and when nearly cold

Fondant 

Two and one-half pounds sugar, one and one-half cups boiling 
water, one-fourth teaspoon cream of tartar. Stir ingredients 
together, heat slowly to boiling point; then boil without stirring 
until a soft ball will form when dropped into a little cold water. 
Pour fondant into a shallow pan, flavor with any Larkin Flavor- 
ing Extract, let stand a few minutes to cool but not long enough 
to become hard around the edge; stir with a wooden paddle 
until white and creamy. It will quickly change from this 
consistency and begin to lump, when it should be kneaded with 
the hands until perfectly smooth. 

Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper and stand aside for 
twenty-four hours if possible. It will then be found easier 
to use. Always make fondant on a clear, dry day. Cream 
Nut Bars, Cream Mints and various candies may all be made 
with this fondant. Shirley M. Shaffer, Oil City, Pa. 

Cocoanut Fudge 

Two cups sugar, two-thirds cup milk, put into a sauce-pan 
and cook over moderate fire until a little dropped into cold 
water will form a soft ball. Remove from fire, add two table- 
spoons butter, cool and add one teaspoon vanilla extract, 
one-half cup shredded cocoanut and one-half cup chopped 
walnuts. Beat all together until the mixture begins to thicken, 
then spread upon buttered tin to thickness of one-half inch. 
Cut into squares. ^^^ George W. Quint, Gray, Maine. 

Peanut Butter Fudge 

Cook together two cups granulated sugar, two tablespoons 
peanut butter and one-half cup milk until it forms a soft ball 
when dropped into cold water. Add one-half teaspoon Larkin 
Vanilla Flavoring Extract, cool and beat until creamy. Pour 
onto a buttered pie-plate and when nearly cold cut in small 
squares. ^^^^ ^ q Caslan, Washington, D. C. 

Pinoche or Divinity 

Take two pounds or four cups Larkin Brown Sugar, one cup 
milk, one-half cup butter, one cup walnuts chopped fine (or any 
other nuts), one-half teaspoon salt. Boil the sugar, milk, butter 
and salt until it forms a soft ball in cold water. Remove from 
stove, add one teaspoon vanilla, cool, add the nuts and beat until 
nearly hard. Pour into buttered pans, mark off in squares when 
cold. For divinity pour the boiling syrup over the stifitly-beaten 
whites of two eggs, add nuts and vanilla and beat until mixture 
will stand alone. ^^^^^ ^ Rommel, Elizabeth, N. J.

Good Results in Cooking 

Good recipes produce good results only when good materials 
are used. 

Good materials are not necessarily those that cost the most, for 
often you will pay the highest price for materials of inferior grade. 

Many good recipes are often condemned because of the use of 
poor materials. Therefore be sure that the materials you use are 
good quality, that the flavoring extracts or spices are full strength 
and that the utensils used are the proper ones.
