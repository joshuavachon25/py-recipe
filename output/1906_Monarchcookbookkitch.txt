The Range That Saves 

A range is something like a 

horse — ^-— -_ I 

You pay so much for a horse 
— its feed and keep amount to so 
much a year. And you get so 
much work from it and it lives so 
long. 

You pay so much for a range 
— its fuel and repairs cost you so 
much. And you get so much cook- 
ing from it — and it lasts yow so long. 

The most expensive item about either a horse or a range is 
not, usually, the first cost — it's the yearly feed and fuel bill. 

It isn't the cheapest horse that costs, say, only $25, eats its 
head off in a year and then goes sick and dies. 

Any more than It Is the cheapest range that costs, say, $25 
and burns up fuel like sixty and then goes all to pieces. 

No, sir, the horse that's worth the most is the one that will 
drive easiest — that doesn't soon tire out — that has no bad tricks — 
that can be relied on — that has a small yearly feed bill — Is health- 
iest and lives longest. 

And the best range is the one that will stand the hardest 
usage — will use the least fuel — that can be perfectly controlled — 
that will last the longest. 

In short, the best horse or the best range Is that which will 
do the most work at the least cost. 

Now, what is a range? 

It Is simply a cooking contrivance consisting of a top and 
an oven — heated bv a fire in a fire box.

THE RANGE THAT SAVES 




Just as a locomotive is best that can convert the most ELerg\^ 
from the coal it uses into Work with the least loss. 

So is a range best which can convert the most Heat of the 
Coal it uses into Cooking Power with the least loss. 
Years ago they had no ranges. 

They cooked over an open grate 
or fire. 

It was a good thing that fuel was 
cheap in those days because this fire 
had to heat the outside air as weV as 
the dish it was intended to coo' 
Yet to a certain extent these 
conditions hold good today. 

For there are many ranges 
are so constructed that they 
convert all the Heat of the coal 
use into Cooking Power — they>,1o 
lot — not because they are as open as the old fashioned open ^ 
but because they are letting in the outside cold air into th^ r 
through nearly every joint and seam — through imperfectly c 
openings at the oven door — the draft door — the ash pan doc 
They lose heat in a range just as you lose heat in a bath 
turn on the cold water as well as the hot water tap. 

Hence there's a waste in fuel — > 

It may not seem much — you maybe won't notice it at 
But by-and-by you will notice that things don't cook 
in your oven or on top of your range as they did at first — 

You have to keep turning dishes in the oven — and - aI/i 
to put such a fierce fire on that you get the top and roi 
your range red hot — in order to have thincrs cook proper] . 



Years Ago 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 



.7e have on record well authenticated cases which show that 
these "loose jointed" ranges will waste about $24.00 worth of 
fuel in a year. 

That's a Conservative or average record. 

At the very least, in sections where fuel is most cheap it is safe 
to say this waste would amount to $12, anyway. 

Remember that's waste and not the entire fuel bill — 
That $24 waste must be figured into the cost of the stove — 
If you pay $40 for such a range it means that the first year 
it costs you $64. 

^-^t the "trouble" doesn't stop at just waste and unsatisfactory 
ng. The material in these ranges may either play out — or 
teriorate that you waste not $24 but $48 or more per year. 
1 other words, your range may play out altogether in from 
five years — for that's the history of this kind of range. 
\o\v certain ranges are not Fuel Wasters and Short Livers 
because we or anybody else say they are. 

The fault lies in the material they're made from and in the 
they're put together. 

"he materials that produce the most of these leaky ranges 
ually the sheet steel and Grey Iron — the most common 
UT.i-ial used in making stoves. 

Iron — the Commercial Metal is made from the element Iron 

i ontains other elements such as graphite, silicon and carbon. 

"ne amount of carbon an iron contains and the way it is 

kvA determine its character and the uses to which it can be 

1 -d. 

he more carbon an iron contains, the more brittle or easily 



^Lahle will it be and the more readily will it be affected by heat, 
^rey Iron contains a high percentage of Carbon — 



THE RANGE THAT SAVES 




You can't hammer Grey Iron — it would break. 
And that's where the trouble comes In In the ordinary sheet 
steel and Grey Iron Ranges. 

For In these stoves, Joints have 
either to be bolted with a thread bolt 
and screwed together or else riveted. 
Then these joints are plastered 
^ with stove putty to make them air- 
tight. Just run the blade of your 
knife some time Into the joint of the 
oven where the stove body and oven 
come together — you can dig the putty 
out — 

Once you put that range In use — 
the alternate heating and cooling causes the metal to expand and 
contract. 

The nut on the thread bolt soon works loose — the seams open 
between the rivets — the stove putty drys up — and sometimes drops 
out. This takes place In every joint In the stove whether bolted 
or riveted. 

There you have your "air leaks" In every joint to waste fuel — 
to cook unsatisfactorily — to worry you. To get worse every day 
until you can no longer use the stove. 



The Knife Test 



Malleable Iron Range 

But Sheet Steel used In combination with Malleable Iron can 
be made Into a perfect range, If the range be properly constructed. 
This stove is known as the Malleable Iron Range. 

Malleable Iron Is about the only metal that can stand the 
extremes of heat and cold without undergoing any serious amount 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 



of contraction and expansion — and Malleable Iron, unlike Grey 
Iron, can be hammered with great force without being broken — 

Malleable Iron 

For the most pronounced difference between Malleable and 
Grey Iron lies in the percentage of Carbon each contains. 

Grey Iron contains a high percentage of Carbon. 

Malleable Iron in its finished state is practically free from 
Carbon. 

It has a close, dense, compact texture. 

It is tough. 

It can be w^orked under the hammer cold. 

It is unbreakable . 

It will stand the fiercest heat. 

When heated red hot you can throw water on it without 
affecting it in the least. 

If made into furnace Grate Bars Malleable Iron will stand 
the hot blast of an air blast furnace for two weeks. 

Grey Iron bars would not last out more than two days. 

Annealing Pots made of Malleable Iron can stand the tremen- 
dous heat to which they are subjected for from nine to fifteen 
heats. 

Grey Iron pots would not last more than three heats. 

For these reasons, Malleable Iron is peculiarly fitted for those 
parts of a range which have to resist the strains of heating and 
cooling — such as the top — anchor plates and covers — and the range 
frames. 

And Malleable Iron is especially fitted for those parts of a 
range that must be riveted air-tight — for it supplies an absolutely 
rigid and non-impressionable base to which the other material of 
the range, i. e., the sheet steel, can be riveted tightly and solidly. 



THE RANGE THAT SAVES 



Hence, if properly constructed — all the joints and seams and 
ail the openings in a Malleable Iron range, such as the oven 
door — the fire door — the draft door — the ash pan door — the back 
flue, etc., can be made practically air tight. 

But not all Malleable Iron Ranges are air-tight and con- 
trollable, however. 

Maybe because their makers do not see the tremendous impor- 
tance of making their stoves air tight. 

Maybe because it costs too much. 

At any rate, there are many Malleable Iron ranges that look 
like pretty good stoves — but they will suck in the cold air from 
the outside through a defective shutting ash box — an open shaker 
hole — a loose damper — or an ill-fitting loose construction some- 
where. 

These kinds of Malleable Iron Ranges are very little, if any 
better than an ordinary old fashioned Steel Range with Grey 
Iron top for they waste fuel just as badly. 

In the Monarch Malleable Iron Range alone is this splendid 
material — Malleable Iron — largely used — with the best quality 
sheet steel — i. e., Wellsville Polished Steel to make a perfect range. 

There are no "Air Leaks" in the Monarch. It is practically 
"air tight" — Body — Fire Box — everywhere. 

The Monarch saves fuel — it keeps in perfect condition for 
years with reasonable use. 

Construction 

Now, here's the way we make a Monarch tight — to stay 

tight- 
Here's the way we prevent "air leaks" that waste your fuel — 

ruin your temper — spoil your bakings — and cost you lots of money. 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 



Here's the way we make a range that you can control per- 
fectly — have your fire as hot as you want in 5 minutes or banked 
down in an equal time. 

Here's the way we make a range that, with reasonable care, 
will cook as well fifteen years from now as it does today — 

First, Madam Housekeeper, we want to ask you what was 
one of the things you most dreaded 
about your ordinary sheet steel 
range — 

Keeping it clean, wasn't it? 

Unless you gave it a hard, back 
breaking rub every day — your range 
looked dirty, unkempt and repulsive — 

Made your whole kitchen look 
untidy, didn't it? 

You couldn't bring your friends 
into your kitchen unless that range 
was cleaned every day. 

Then when you _did clean it the black lead was pretty sure 
to get on your pots and pans and increase your work keeping 
them clean — 

Well, you won't have any such trouble with the Monarch. 

For the top — i. e., anchor plate and covers — is of Malleable 
Iron, polished bright as a well-worn steel rail. After the first use, 
the anchor plates and covers turn a deep blue color. The top 
of the Monarch requires only a little rubbing with a cloth once 
a day to keep it clean and bright. There's no back-breaking 
polishing and rubbing with the Monarch as you have to do in 
ordinary ranges. 




-^P- 



The hard work of cleaning 
the ordinary range 



THE RANGE THAT SAVES 




The housewife can show the Monarch to her friend at any 
time with pride and pleasure. It makes her kitchen look clean 
and inviting. 

Then the top of the Monarch is lighter in weight than an 
ordinary grey iron top. 

A lighter and more close grained metal will transmit heat 
more quickly and with less loss than a thicker metal. 

Now, fully four-fifths of the 
household cooking is done on the top 
of a range. 

Therefore, a top that will heat 
more quickly and conduct more heat 
with less loss will save fuel — see the 
point? 

And it will do more — it will save 

The difference between the Monarch 

Polished Top and the your stovc's firc box — lengthen the 

ordinary top 

life of your stove. 

These are some of the points of superiority of the Monarch's 
Malleable top — over others. 

Still another is its strength. 

You can strike two of the covers together but they won't 
break — 

Strike two Grey Iron Covers together and you'll have to 
buy a new pair. 

The Frames in the Monarch are of Malleable Iron — 

The top frame that binds the body of the stove together and 
each of the frames around the Oven Door — the Ash Door — the 
Pouch Feed — the Warming Closet opening — and at the back of 
the Oven, etc., form an absolutely rigid base to w^hich the steel 
can be riveted — a base unaffected by the extremes of temperature 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 9 

and all these Malleable Frames are riveted tight and solid to the 
Body, making a practically air-tight construction everywhere. 

Now, this is the way the frames are riveted around the Body 
openings — 

A flange of this frame projects inward to cover the Steel of 
the Body — that's how we do it. 

That's why we don't need to use an ounce of Stove Putty 
in a year in Monarchs. 

That's why there are no thread bol^-s or steel riveted to steel 
to work loose and open up joints all over the range. 

The Range Body 

The body of the Monarch is made of 18-gauge Wellsville 
Polished Steel — the best and handsomest steel manufactured. 

This Body remains for years, with a little care, a handsome 
deep blue color. 

Other makers charge extra for a Wellsville Polished Steel 
Body — this is a tacit admission that it is better than any other 
material for Stove Bodies. 

A Wellsville Polished Steel Body is far superior to a painted 
body — a painted body has to be repainted — it always looks 
gummed — it turns brown — accumulates lint and dust and can 
never be repainted successfully. 

The Asbestos Lining 

The Body of the Monarch is lined with Asbestos riveted to a 
sheet of steel. 

This steel is in turn attached to the body — and the Asbestos 
is exposed to the superheated air in the flue passing over and 
around the Oven. 



10 



THE RANGE THAT SAVES 




The Monarch Fireb 



The Asbestos reflects the heat onto the Oven where it is 
needed. 

In ordinary ranges where the Asbestos is for the most part 
covered with steel — the steel absorbs the heat, taking it away from 
the oven. 

The Asbestos lining in the Monarch 
can be readily removed if it should ever 
be necessary to do so. 

And since it is not riveted to the right 
side of the Range Body it does not mark up 
the Range Body but leaves it smooth and 
attractive — 

It must not be supposed from this that 
all the heat in the Monarch is contained in 
the range — that the Monarch will not heat 
the kitchen if so required. 
Far from it. 

The Monarch Top will heat even better than the Tops of 
other ranges — 

And if you want a fine warm floor just open the warming 
closet door — 

You will have more heat than you could get from a base 
burner. 

The Firebox 

Does it take about an hour to get up a cooking fire in your 
range ? 

And when you are through with it, does it take about an hour 
for it to "slow down" again? 

That's the trouble nearly every one experiences who has an 
ordinary range. 

And it's caused by a leaky fire box — one that you can't control. 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 



11 




Where the ordinary damper 
leaks air 



You see in ordinary sheet steel ranges with Grey Iron Tops 
and in most Malleable Iron Ranges there are many places where 
the outside air gets into the Fire Box. 

Maybe through the long draft damper that is regulated by a 
slide at the left side of the range — 

This damper is usually merely a 
cast plate bolted to the steel body — 
(it can't be riveted because it would 
break) — 

The bolts work loose through 
this expansion and contraction of the 
metal and an opening is formed 
between the frame of the draft plate 
and the steel in the Body for air to 
get in — even when the damper is shut. 

Then, air gets in through the opening allowed for the grate 
bar to come through for shaking and dumping — through the 
bolted and puttied Ash Box opening or front Damper — or the 
Ash Pan opening or where the Ash Pan pulls out Door and 
all — for this kind of Ash Pan invariably slides up on the Ashes 
when being returned and leaves a "gap" in the opening to let in air. 

When you can't shut your Fire Box off perfectly and tightly, 
you are using Fuel when you don't want it — therefore you're 
wasting money. 

With a Monarch you can have a fire whenever you want it — 

It responds almost as quickly as the fire in a gas stove. 

And when you're through with it, you can bank it down in 
very nearly the same time that it takes to turn out a Gas Fire. 

For you have perfect control of your fire in the Monarch 
fire box — because it is practically air-tight — 



12 THE RANGE THAT SAVES 

No air can get in anywhere — for the Feed Door, the Ash Door 
and the Duplex Draft opening are all riveted tight and solid to 
a Malleable Iron Frame — 

And the opening for the Grate Bar is closed with an Indicator 
which tells whether the Wood or Coal Side of the Grate is in use. 

Then the Fire Box of the Monarch has proven in thousands 
of instances that it won't crack — burn out from heat or be eaten 
out by smoke, acids and gases like ordinary range Fire Boxes. 

The Linings are made of extra heavy castings — for the strain 
on the Monarch Fire Box is so slight that we can use castings — 
they're cheaper than Malleable Iron. The back wall of the Fire 
Box is perpendicular and in 4 pieces to provide for heat expansion. 
It is also corrugated to prevent a solid contact with coal. 

Then there is a liberal space between the back of the rear wall 

of the Fire Box and the front of the oven and the front lining 

of Fire Box and left end of Range Body to enable the circulation 

of air and so prevent burned-out linings. 

* * * 

Did you ever try to burn wood on a Coal Grate? 

You weren't very successful, were you? 

For, usually, the wood grate has smaller holes in it than the 
coal — Therefore it won't burn coal readily. 

In an ordinary range }'0u couldn't tell, 
however, which you were using — wood or 
coal grate. 

But in the Monarch you can tell every 
time by the Indicator — outside on the 
Range Body next the grate shaft for 
shaking and dumping. ^'" ^rate indicator 

But the Principal feature of the Monarch Fire Box is the 
Duplex Draft, 




MALLEABLE IROxN RANGE CO. 



13 




Tht Duplex Draft 



You know the difficulties of the Ordinary ranse draft- 
It is either at one end of the Fire 
Box and makes an uneven fire — hot 
towards the draft side — cold towards 
the back of the stove. 

Or it is across the left side of the 
stove and leaks air, as we have seen. 

There's no uneven fire in the Mon- 
arch — no "air leaks" — 

Simply an absolutely uniform fire from one end of the Fire Box 
to the other — and that's due to the Duplex Draft. 

The Duplex Draft is a draft at the front and back of the 
Fire Box. 

You pull a handle and both back and front drafts open 
simultaneously — then you shut them up in the same way. 

The big advantage of the Duplex Draft is in the fact that it 
sends an even flow^ of heat the entire width of the stove to 
envelop the Oven. 

The Oven 

Does your oven cook more quickly on one side than on 
another — do you have to keep turning your roasts around so's 
to have them browned uniformly? 

Is your oven slow — do you have 
to put on a roaring fire to have your 
Food cooked at all? 

Do you know what's the matter? 

Either a leaky oven with nearly 

every joint letting in cold air — or 

else the trouble's caused by the one 

sided flow of hot air from the fire 

The construction of the , ^ , •ill 

ordinary oven Dox irom the one-sideo damper. 




14 THE RANGE THAT SAVES 

Now, we know how this one-sided heat is caused. 
You see, the ordinary range oven is fastened to the Body by 
simply turning over or flanging the Steel and riveting it to the 
Body. 

This joint then has its "liberal allowance" of Stove Putty — to 
hide the crack underneath. 

After a few heatings and coolings the Stove Putty shrivels up 
and there is Mr. Crack letting in the cold air to beat the band. 

* * * 
You can place four potatoes of equal size in each corner of 
the Monarch Oven and one in the center and at the end of a 
certain time they will be cooked uniformly. 

Your roasts and bakings will be deliciously and uniformly 
browned. 

You won't have to keep turning dishes and pans In the 
(Monarch oven to have your food cooked uniformly. 

And you can do it on a minimum 
amount of fuel. 

Because the Monarch oven Is the 
only oven that has a perfectly uniform 
envelope of heat — due to the Duplex 
Draft. 

And it Is the only oven that does 
not leak air. 

For the Monarch oven Is riveted 
tight and solid to Malleable Iron 

Construction of Monarch oven 

frames both back and front. 

The sides and top of the oven are 16-gauge patent leveled 
cold rolled steel. 

And the bottom will neither warp nor buckle and cook your 
puddings crooked, for it is made of 12-gauge steel (about three 




MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 15 

times as heavy as the material in same place in an ordinary range), 
reinforced by the Flue strip which is flanged and riveted to the 
oven bottom and the Flue bottom. 

The top of the oven is braced with a Malleable Arch — this in 
turn supports the Anchor plates on the top. 

You can place a wash boiler with 80 or 90 pounds of water 
on the Anchor Plates when they're hot and you won't spring 
them the fraction of a quarter of an inch. 

The Monarch oven is absolutely rigid — two men can stand 
on the oven door — that will give you an idea of the splendid 

construction of the Monarch. 

* * * 

When you open the Monarch oven door your kitchen won't 
fill with smoke or cooking odors. 

For the Monarch oven is ventilated. 

The Reservoir 

The Monarch is provided with a reservoir at either the right 
or left hand side of the range. The Reservoir at the left hand 
side is much better than the left reservoir used in any other range. 

It is made of Copper — Nickel Plated 
— has a large capacity and heats by con- 
tact with a plate forming part of the 
Fire Box. 

It is held firmly against this plate 
by its ow^n weight — it is not simply 
pushed against the contact plate either 
by pinions or by hand as in other ranges 
— to become detached from the contact plate 
by vibration of the kitchen floor and not to The le/t side 

heat. The Monarch reservoir has a close 
direct contact — it will heat water more quickly than any other 
reservoir. 




16 THE RANGE THAT SAVES 

Then it rests on movable brackets — which can be moved out- 
ward to break the contact whenever the water boils or "thumps." 

The Reservoir on the right hand side is in contact with a 
Convex Plate, which we rivet to the side of the range. This plate 
is heated uniformly by the even flow of superheated air passing 
over and around the oven. There are no special reservoir dampers 
in the Monarch to rob your oven of heat or to get clogged with 
ashes. 

The Heating plate forms a part 

^^^f'^ of the body and swells or bulges out- 

^^^^^a^ ward. The side of the tank is drawn 

M^^^^Hk tightly against the plate, forming a 
^^H^HB solid contact at every point and pre- 
"^^^ venting air space between the tank 
and heating plate. 
, , „ This reservoir has a malleable top 

The right side Resrrvolf 

flush with the top of the Range. 

The tank is made of copper. 

It is not connected permanently with the body of the range 
but is covered with a casing or skirting near it. 

This casing or skirting is open at the bottom so that there is a 
free circulation of air to prevent the sweating and rusting common 
in all other "closed in" reservoirs. 

The Waterfront 

•The Monarch waterfronts are made in three styles. We 
make a waterfront for ranges burning soft coal or wood. 

This is known as the Pin Extension waterfront. It projects 
the water practically over the fire and presents a much greater 
heating surface than any other waterfront. 





MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 17 

The advantage of the waterfront is that it will produce enough 
hot water when cooking meals to keep you supplied with hot 
\vater the whole day long — and it does not require a special fire 
to heat your boiler of water and waste fuel as in those stoves 
which are not equipped with the Pin Extension waterfront. 

Then we have another waterfront 
for ranges using hard coal. This is of 
less heating surface, since a hard coal 
fire is burning most of the time, unlike 
soft coal or w^ood. 

Then we make still another water- 
front to accommodate a Pouch Feed — 
having a larger heating surface than 
that in any other range using a Pouch 

p'gpfj^ The Firebox and Pin Extension 

IFaterfront 

Lower Flue Lining 

The Lower Flue Lining underneath the oven which forms 
the top of the warming closet beneath the range is made of 
steel almost double the thickness used at this point in other ranges. 
This prevents any damage from Creosote eating the metal which 
is commonly experienced in other ranges. 

The Warming Closet 

The Warming Closet underneath the regular oven in the 
Monarch presents an absolutely dry place for storing cooking 
utensils and such articles as require care to prevent rust. 

It will also give as good a heat on a cold winter morning as 
a base burner. 



18 THE RANGE THAT SAVES 

The Top Closet 

The Top Closet is supplied with a roll door or two "drop 
forward" doors. The drop forward doors are Malleable, fitted 
to Malleable frames — they can easily hold a heavy load. 

There is room for a large dinner to be kept warm in this 
Top Closet and a woman with it can handle many more cooking 
utensils about a Monarch range than she can in any other range. 

The Shelf 

The Shelf projecting at the right hand side of the Monarch 
is an article of great utility. 

It is made of Malleable Iron and 
will hold securely a boiler of water 
and as many flat-irons as the house- 
wife can pile on. 

This will be appreciated by those 
people who have had an ordinary 
Grey Iron Shelf break off under even 

Monarch Bach Flue v;ith ^ ^^ght load. 

Malleable Bottom 

The Three Piece Damper 

The "back" damper or damper at the Pipe Collar is made of 
only three pieces — and it fits perfectly and won't break. An 
advantage every woman will value who has had the bother and 
expense of an ordinary complicated breakable damper. 

The Oven Thermometer 
The Monarch oven thermometer is of the latest and most 
approved pattern. 




MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 19 

By it the heat of the oven can be perfectly regulated — 

You don't have to experiment or test the heat of your oven. 
There's no chance of having a hotter fire than you require — 

Roasts that require a variable fire — hotter at first, then more 
moderate, can be cooked to a delicious perfection by means of the 
Monarch Thermometer. 

Its accuracy saves Fuel. 

The Fuel 

There are no restrictions as to the kind of fuel to use in a 
Monarch — Hard Coal — Soft Coal — or even Lignite will burn 
perfectly and economically. 

Wood, Cobs or other light fuels are used on the wood side 
of the Grate. 

A Malleable Iron extension which is riveted tight to the back 
part of the fire box — not merely bolted to come loose as in other 
ranges — is provided where long wood is used. 

The Way to Clean Out the Flues 

Place the Ash Pan partly inside the warming closet. 

Open the clean out door. 

And you can take out all the ashes in the flues without getting 
any on yourself or in your kitchen — as you will have to do with 
an ordinary range. 

The Ash Pan is provided with Ash Sheds — which direct the 
ashes into the Ash Pan, preventing them from dropping outside 
of the Pan. 

The frame to which the Ash Door is hinged is higher than 
the bottom of the Ash Pit. 



20 THE RANGE THAT SAVES 

You can draw out the Ash Pan without littering your floor 

with ashes. 

* * * 

The Nickeling in ordinary ranges is mighty bothersome to 
keep clean. 

It is so elaborate — has so many places to collect lint and dust 
that a housewife has to spend much of her time trying to clean it. 

For if this nickeling isn't properly cleaned it makes the whole 
range look dirty. 

Then another thing about ordinary nickeling — 

It nearly always looks flat — its color has no depth to it. 

In the Monarch that's all different. 

In the first place the nickelings are all high surface. 

Simply a rub will keep them clean — there are no places to 
collect lint and dust. 

Then it's a much better and deeper color — for we do our 
nickeling better than that done on any other range. 

It's a mighty handsome Range, take it all in all. 

All in good taste — 

An ornament to any woman's kitchen. 

* * * 

The Protecting Bar is made of special steel — don't be afraid 
of it — you can lift the stove with it. 

The foregoing is a complete analysis of every part of the 
Monarch Malleable Iron Range. 

It tells you why the Monarch is better than any other range 
made, in every individual part and in the complete range. 

It shows why the Monarch will cook better — will give better 
satisfaction and will last longer than any other range. 



MALLEABLE IRON RANGE CO. 21 



And above all — since the Monarch is practically air-tight to 
stay air-tight, therefore perfectly controllable — this analysis shows 
why the Monarch saves fuel — the largest expense item in con- 
nection with a range. 

Now, although the Monarch is vastly superior to every other 
stove — Malleable — Grey Iron — Sheet Steel, etc. 

Although our range operatives are all specialists in their line 
of Monarch Construction, commanding good wages. 

Although every bit of work is submitted to the closest possible 
inspection. 

And although every ounce of Malleable material in the 
Monarch is tested by a drop hammer before being accepted for 
Monarchs — all items of cost that very few other range manufac- 
turers have to pay — 

Yet the first cost of the Monarch, that as we have seen saves 
Fuel and therefore Money, is very little more than that of the 
ordinary stove which loses or wastes on an average $24.00 a year 
in fuel. 

Thus, you see, if your income is moderate you can't afford to 
buy any other range than the Monarch. 

Unless you have no regard for money and can afiford to waste 
it you should secure a Monarch at your earliest opportunit}'. 

Write us — The Malleable Iron Range Company at Beaver 
Dam, Wisconsin, and we will tell you where and how you can 
obtain a Monarch. 

Do it today, won't you, please?

THE RANGE THAT SAVES 




Complete Triumph and Highest Anjuards at the 
Leivis and Clark Exposition, IQO^ 

The first exposition at which Monarch Malleable Iron Ranges were 
ever displayed, was the great Lewis and Clark Centennial at Portland, 
Oregon, in 1905. 

Dozens of prize-winning ranges of other makes from the Chicago and 
St. Louis World's Fairs were there. Over these, the Monarch Malleable 
received two gold medals and two diplomas. So strongly impressed were 
the Committee of Award with the superiority of the Monarch Malleable 
Range that they wrote us unsolicited the letter which we reproduce on the 
next page, stating that they gave us the highest award on the first ballot, 
and that had there been any higher prize offered, the Monarch Ran ge 
woul d certainly have received it ! They say also that they found the 
Monarch the best finished and best constructed Range, with more special 
features than any other range on exhibition. 

No letter of commendation was given to any other exhibitor of ranges 
by the Jury. 

The Jury was international in scope, being composed of representa- 
tives of foreign governments besides Americans of prominence in Mechani- 
cal Engineering. 

This award, with the commendatory letter of the Jury, is therefore 
the prize of prizes, placing the Monarch Ranges where they belong, at the 
very top of all ranges. It is a merited recognition of quality in design, 
material and workmanship of which we are proud, and its verdict is con- 
firmed by the great American public, the court of last resort.

INTRODUCTORY 

To make an unprejudiced, representative Cook Book, filled with 
practical, reliable recipes, reasonably economical, yet thoroughly 
modern, presenting a well balanced diet, suitable for every day as 
well as for special occasions — that has been the object in preparing 
this -600k Book. 

The information has been drawn from the very best authorities 
and from experience- Many of these recipes, not to be found in 
any other book, are likely to become family favorites. There are 
old favorites from everywhere, making this collection a rare and 
valuable one. 

Recipes by Fannie M. Farmer are quoted from her "Boston 
Cooking School Cook Book;" those by Mrs. Janet McKenzie 
Hill are from her own Cook Book and from her "Boston Cooking 
School Magazine;" those by Mrs. E, E. Kellogg, A. M,, are from 
her Vegetarian Cook Book, "Science in the Kitchen." 

While this book has been compiled with a view to giving 
reliable recipes, without regard to apparatus, housewives will find 
their results far more satisfactory if a Monarch Range be used, 
owing largely to its responsiveness to regulation, enabling the 
housewife to get promptly just the amount of heat required for 
the food she is preparing. 

Success in cooking very largely depends upon right heat and 
right regulation of heat, sometimes starting with a moderate oven, 
for instance, as for bread, increasing the heat for final baking; 
sometimes beginning with a quick fire, as for a meat roast, con- 
tinuing with moderated heat. 

Those who need and enjoy the best but cannot afford the most 
costly, will value this book. To them it is heartily dedicated.

II. 
FOODS— What to Eat and Why 

"The ideal diet is that combination of foods which, while imposing the least 
burden on the body, supplies it with exactly sufficient material to meet its wants." 

Disregard for this standard will surely prevent the best development of our 
powers — and unnecessarily impoverishes the purse. 

While in most foods some waste is unavoidable, the loss in cost can be dimin- 
ished by buying those kinds on which there is least waste, and by carefully 
utilizing portions often thrown away but which contain considerable nutrition. 

The chief sources of waste are: Eating more than can be utilized by the 
body — the American tendency is to overeat, serving more than can be eaten and 
not utilizing the portions left; wasting in preparation — by thick parings of fruits 
and vegetables, or throwing away bones and meat trimmings which contain nutri- 
tive ingredients. Many good bones and trimmings (which you have paid for) are 
left on the butcher's block, and he often sells them again for soups and stews. 

To replace costly food sometimes badly cooked, by cheaper food well cooked, is 
important for both health and purse. 

Diet should be varied and well balanced. Each menu should be planned with 
a view to furnishing the right proportions of all the nutrients needed for the 
body; the food should be prepared with neatness and care and daintily served 
upon a clean, neatly laid table. 

Foods must be selected with three main objects. 

The appetite must be stimulated; protein compounds must be furnished for 
making blood, tissues, muscle and bone; and there must be carbohydrates and 
fats to supply energy and warmth. 

Protein is the great building material and the everyday diet usually contains 
too little of it. 

The less expensive cuts of meat, such as the round of beef and stew meat, are 
fully as nutritious as the more expensive cuts and usually more so. Fish, milk, 
beans, peas and oatmeal are the other famous tissue builders. Do not overlook 
these inexpensive but valuable foods. 

The starches, sugars and other carbohydrates and all fats will furnish the 
heat and energy required. The average person gets enough of these. The house- 
wife should pay particular attention to supplying the tissue builders and to making 
her table attractive, that the appetite may always be tempted. 

Salads and garnishes, however simple, greatly aid in attractiveness which is 
vitally important. Things which please the palate stimulate the flow of digestive 
juices and an attractive diet pleases the aesthetic sense. Refinement in food habits 
is as desirable as in other phases of our daily life. 

Soups are chiefly useful as stimulants. They help to create appetite and start 
the digestive juices preparatory to receiving and digesting the solid foods. Soups 
are rendered more nutritious by the addition of vegetables and cubes of meat. 

Always remember that with a varied diet it is easier to secure the propear 
proportions of protein to fats and carbohydrates. 

Diflferent persons are differently constituted with respect to the kinds of food 
they can best digest, while some occupations create demands for food quite dif- 
ferent from that required for other work. Those exposed to cold, or whose work 
calls for great bodily activity and strong muscles require not only the proteins 
for nutrition and muscle but an extra supply of carbohydrates and fats to supply 
energy and warmth. 

Those who are indoors or inactive, require moderate nutrition and very mod- 
erate quantities of fat producers; otherwise the fat will simply be stored in the 
body and will become a useless burden. 



38 THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 

Brain workers require the best of nutrition and variety of food, should exercise 
as much as possible and need a liberal supply of fats and carbohydrates to offset 
nervousness. A little fat is good for them. 

The food should suit the individual and his or her needs. The housewife 
should observe what foods agree with the different members of her flock, should 
encourage their eating such foods and should discourage the others, planning her 
menus accordingly. Every person may learn from experience what food agrees 
with him and what does not. 

PROTEIN COMPOUNDS. 

The foods richest in protein compounds, also known as nitrogenous foods, are 
as follows (those in italic are best of all) : 

Rib rolls and round of beef. 

Stew meat, especially the neck. 

Dried, salted and smoked beef. 

Veal. 

Chicken and fowl. 

Fresh cod. 

Salt cod. 

Halibut. 

Mackerel. 

Shad roe. 

Smoked Herring. 

Salmon. 

Sardines. 

Clams. 

Oysters. 

Eggs. 

Milk (unskimmed). 

Cheese. 

Entire wheat flour. 

Whole wheat breakfast foods. 

Graham flour. 

Wheat flour. 

Oatmeal and all oat breakfast foods. 

Barley and barley foods. 

Dried beans and peas and 

All beans and peas (fresh or dried). 

Spinach. 

Dandelion and all "greens." 

Water Cress. 

Almonds. 

Peanuts. 

CARBOHYDRATES. 
The chief carbohydrates (which make fat and thus produce energy and warmth) 
are: 

Wheat flour and wheat breakfast foods. 

Entire wheat flour and foods. 

Graham flour. 

Macaroni, vermicelli, etc. 

Buckwheat flour. 

■Rye flour. 

Corn meal. 

Oat breakfast foods.

FATS. 

Fats are derived directly from the following and similar products: 

Fat meats. 

Goose. 

Butter. 

Milk. 

Cream. 

Cheese. 

Nuts. 

Chocolate. 

Cocoa. 
Pork, of course, contains a large amount of fat, but it is not included in above 
table and has not received great attention in this book because, while compara- 
tively inexpensive, it contains less nutrition in proportion to cost than other meats, ' 
it is difficult to digest and is, more than any other meat, liable to be unwhole- 
some, either from unfit animals, careless killing and handling or on account of 
germs contained in it. 

Bacon and ham, when thoroughly cooked, are the most nutritious and the safest 
forms of pork. 

HEALTHFUL ACCESSORIES. 

All "greens," such as asparagus, spinach, dandelion, beet tops, cowslip leaves, 
etc. (cooked), and lettuce, celery, green onions, parsley, "sour grass," nasturtium, 
etc. (uncooked), many of which may be had for the gathering, are valuable, not 
only as appetizers, but in "toning up" the system. They are not, however, highly 
nutritive. Asparagus, spinach, dandelion and cowslip are noted for their bene- 
ficial effect upon both liver and kidneys. Onions, either boiled or green onions 
eaten with salt, should have place on the table once a week. They are the 
regular Saturday night vegetable in many well regulated homes. 

FRUITS. 

Do not overlook the fruit, ,/hich should be eaten as the first thing for break- 
fast, before the breakfast food. Fruit helps wonderfully in keeping the system 
in good order. Its acids stimulate the flow of digestive juices and, most impor- 
tant of all, stimulate the bowels to healthful activity. There is nothing better 
than a baked apple or a dish of prunes cooked with a bit of lemon. In the spring, 
steamed or stewed pieplant is pleasant and healthful. 

WINTER AND SUMMER DIET. 

In winter more carbohydrates and fats are needed, to supply warmth, although 
plenty of proteids are also needed, by those who labor. 

In summer, use the fats and carbohydrates sparingly. Patronize the protein 
compounds liberally. They also furnish some fats, enough for summer needs, 
except for those who do hard manual labor. Use the fruits liberally. Sweet 
berries with bread and milk make a wholesome summer diet. Avoid pastries, 
heavy puddings and foods fried in fats, in summer time. They are too heating. 
Cold desserts, especially those made with gelatine and containing fruits, are 
wholesome and refreshing. 

WATER. 

Drink little water at meals. A glassful an hour before eating or two hours 
afterward is best; also take a glassful, either hot or cold, with a bit of salt in it 
if desired, on getting up in the morning, and drink a glass of water before retiring. 

Drink plenty of good water. 

Avoid ice water in summer.

Cook by Rale — The Chemistry of Cookingf 

She who cooks by rule need seldom have a failure. 

Even those "natural born cooks," who usually "guess at it" and usually make 
good things, may be wasting good materials in a way they little dream. 

There is a wonderful law of definite proportions by which substances always 
combine in the same definite proportions. 

All good recipes require that just the right amount be used, for success. Any 
more than is needed is absolute waste. 

Especially is this true of baking powder, for instance. A certain amount is 
required to raise a given amount of dough. Combination with other substances, 
under heat, breaks the baking powder up -into, usually, water, common salt and 
carbon dioxide, the gas which, in expanding to escape, makes the dough "light." 
The water and salt remain and are harmless. But if more baking powder is used 
than the dough requires, the extra amount is not broken up into the escaping gas 
and the harmless salt and water, and in eating the cake or biscuit, we must eat 
a chemical which, in some cheap baking powders, is really harmful. Beside, this 
extra amount does no good in the cake and is wasted. 

Cook by rule and have no failures j no waste. 

These are such good reasons for measuring carefully and for following good 
recipes that we will not go farther into the complex chemistry of this interesting 
subject. 

Another point, however, with which the chemistry of cooking is concerned is 
the question of heat. 

Heat helps chemical action, but some things require much heat, some require 
a little, some need quick heat and some long, slow cooking. 

Albumens and proteids, those substances which are so important in building 
and maintaining the tissues and strength of the body, are coagulated and made 
almost insoluble by too quick heat, while fats are broken up by it and are made 
hard to digest while delicate flavors are thus destroyed. 

One great trouble with American cooking today is that food is cooked too 
quickly, is too often burned and is almost always injured in flavor and digest- 
ibility by being cooked too quickly over too hot a fire. Especially is this true 
where gas is used. 

Too hot a fire destroys the delicate flavors which make food most delicious — 
give the cook no opportunity for "bringing out" the savory qualities of meat, of 
giving just the right delicate brown to breads and cakes, or of developing that 
mysterious, subtle flavor in the oatmeal which makes it "truly Scotch." 

The Scotch, by the way, depend mostly upon the open fire, even now; our 
grandmothers, too, understood the art of cooking and had good means for apply- 
ing it with the even heat of their brick ovens. Few are the modern ovens which 
can equal those crude but skillfully handled ovens of long ago. 

The ideal stove should give a steady, controllable heat, should be quick to respond to dampers 
and drafts, giving an even, moderate heat, most of the time, fully capable of throwing much heat 
just when it is needed and of permitting the temperature to be reduced in a few moments, when 
desired. 

The art of cooking, remember, is largely the art of producing flavors which 
create appetite and please the palate, and of so preparing the different foods that 
the right changes take place in them. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 41 

IV, 
Menus — Colof Effects — Diet Balance 

The following menus are given not so much to present extraordinary combina- 
tions as to give examples of menus which are well balanced and which present 
appetizing and wholesome combinations of foods which are seasonable and are 
available by average people in average localities. 

Note also the color combinations. The French chef always thinks of the 
colors of the foods he will combine. Tomato soup, corned beef, sliced tomatoes and 
strawberries, might well be called a red lunch and it would not be an appetizing 
one. Soup, vegetables, meat, salad and dessert should all be thoughtfully planned 
with a view to producing attractive color combinations which harmonize yet lend 
the contrast which gives zest to appetite. 

In planning the menu, always remember relative nutritive values of foods, 
endeavoring in summer to give sufficient nutrition without over-heating the blood 
by too many fats, sugars and carbohydrates; while in winter the diet should be 
both substantial and heat producing for ample supply of energy and body warmth.

The Model Kitchen 

A northwestern exposure is usually considered the more desirable for a 
kitchen, as it gives a cool kitchen in the morning when work is to be done. 
This also coincides with the preference for the east front for the house and 
southern exposure for the living rooms. 

For the average family a large kitchen is preferable and in the plan here 
given, the kitchen is 15 by IS feet. It could be 12 by 12, if preferred, but in 
many homes the kitchen is used as the everyday dining room or for sewing, and 
should not be crowded. 

In the design here given, note the few steps required between the stove, the 
sink and cooking table, and the pantry, where the greater portion of the kitchen 
work is to be done. 

First of all, the sink should be high enough to permit washing the dishes 
without bending. What housewife has not wondered why builders insist upon 
setting the sink six inches too low? Insist that the sink shall be 36 inches high 
to the top of its rim. Being about six inches deep, this brings the bottom of the 
sink about 30 inches from the floor. If sink legs cannot be obtained long enough 
to permit setting the sink as high as this, the sink can be placed upon a six-inch 
platform wholly enclosed, and of the same material as the floor. 

The setting of sinks too low, is responsible for the breaking of many dishes, 
as the faucets must be proportionately placed, and are so low that in putting 
dishes in and out of the pan, the faucets are directly in the way and dishes are 
often nicked and broken by coming in contact with them. If the sink, and 
therefore faucets, are set six inches higher, the latter are not in the way. 

The sink should have two drain boards, the one on the left for dishes to be 
washed, and the one on the right for draining them. 

The cooking table at the right is convenient for receiving the dishes when 
wiped. The slide over the cooking table also permits setting the wiped dishes 
directly through into the pantry, ready to be put up into their places. 

Over the left drain board should be a small closet, preferably built in, for 
soaps, silver, brass and stove polishes, etc. Back of the stove and across the 
front of the chimney, a shelf about on a level with the eyes, is attractive and 
convenient. Just beneath this shelf, near the sink, should be a small drying rack 
(for dish towels), which, when not in use, can be swung back under the shelf. 
At the left of the chimney should be a closet for the broom, dust pan, shovel, 
carpet sweeper, scrub pail, etc. In the corner, at the left of the broom closet, 
should be two large hooks screwed into the top of the wainscoting upon which 
the clothes bars may be folded and hung when not in use. This leaves the 
clothes bars about six inches from the floor, and enables the neat housewife to 
sweep the corner without the inconvenience of moving the rack each time. 

Now, let us go back to the working corner. The cooking table should be 
covered preferably with zinc, nailed neatly to the edges. This is non-absorbent 
and can be kept immaculately clean. The next best thing is a covering of oil 
cloth cut just large enough to tack over the edges of the table. 

The pantry door is usually open and upon the inside of it may be hung the 
roller towel, which is out of sight when the door is closed. Let this towel always 
be kept fresh. Just inside the pantry door, on the right, are compartments for 
flour barrels, above which is a broad shelf and over this may be a cupboard with 
doors, for cereals such as breakfast foods, tapioca, rice, corn meal, rye, graham, 
etc., also for the spices, condiments, baking powder, cooking soda, flavoring ex- 
tracts, coffee, tea,, etc. Across the entire side of the pantry should be shelves 
extending to the ceiling, the bottom one being on a level with the broad shelf over 
the flour barrels. Under this bottom shelf should be a cleat for strong hooks upon 
which the heavy frying pans, griddles, waffle-irons, etc., may be hung. At the 
north end of the pantry is a window with a broad shelf in front of it and 
drawers for kitchen linens, such as dish towels, hand towels, etc., also for wrap- 
ping paper, twine, fruit jar covers, etc. At the left as one faces the window, may 
be another tier of shelves; the lower one to be not less than four or five feet

from the floor, and under it at least two cleats with plenty of hooks for egg 
beaters, can openers, mixing spoons and similar small utensils, each to be hung 
always upon its own hook. 

The door to the basement or cellar may be as indicated, while just to the 
right of it is the door into the china closet which should be between the kitchen 
and dining room. 

If two maids are kept, there should be a second sink in the china closet or 
butler's pantry where the dining room girl may wash the better china and silver. 
At the left of this sink should be a drain board. At the left of this should be a 
broad shelf for serving and at this point there should be a slide between the china 
closet and the kitchen with a serving table on the kitchen side. Through this 
slide the cook may hand the courses to the dining room girl. Over this serving 
shelf in the china closet, may be shelves for china or for such utensils as the 
dining room girl may require. On the opposite side of the china closet should be 
shelves for china, extending from floor to ceiling, and enclosed by sliding glass 
doors. A portion of the china closet or butler's pantry should be partitioned off 
for food supplies. In this supply closet is a window which furnishes fresh air 
and from which light may be derived for the pantry by a glass in the upper half 
of the door between this closet and the china closet. 

The refrigerator should be located in this supply closet and in homes where 
every comfort may be enjoyed, this refrigerator should be built in, having thick 
walls insulated against temperature changes, while the compartment for ice is 
filled through a small door which opens upon the porch. When this is not pos- 
sible, the refrigerator may be of any type desired. Thus located, it is well away 
from the kitchen heat and when cooking is to be done, the butter and eggs 
needed may be taken from the refrigerator when the orderly housewife gets her 
supplies ready for her baking. Nearly all foods kept in the refrigerator are des- 
tined for the table or come from the table, and this arrangement will be found 
both convenient and economical. In this supply closet should also be a fruit 
closet with door to shut out the light and keep the temperature even. Here 
preserves and cannned fruits m.ay be kept to excellent advantage. Also the reserve 
supply of cake, cookies, doughnuts, bread, etc. 

The kitchen arranged as here suggested will be found delightfully convenient 
and an enjoyable living room for the morning hours.

VI 
Soups and Soup Makm§f 



Soups are useful chiefly as appetizers 
and as an agreeable means of utilizing 
small portions of meat and vegetables 
which must otherwise be wasted. Soups 
are therefore a necessity where economy 
is a consideration and are rendered nu- 
tritious by the addition of cubes of 
meat, vegetables, or cereals, such as 
vermicelli, macaroni, barley, etc. 

Soup with stock may be made from 
any kind of meat, or from several 
kinds combined. Fats in soup enrich 
it, the desirable parts being held by the 
stock, while the grease will rise to 
the top and, when cool, may be re- 
moved in cakes. 

Fortunatelj% the inexpensive cuts of 
meat make the best soup. The shin 
of the hind quarter is a rich soup bone. 
Portions of meat should be used as 
well as bone, and soups should be 
cooked slowly, at low temperature, 
that the goodness may be thoroughly 
extracted and that the albuminoids may 
not be coagulated. 

The practice of keeping a soup kettle 
always upon the stove is a very bad 
one. 

Save the bits until enough have 
accumulated for a soup (making sure 
that all are still sweet), or, if there 
are good fragments, but not quite 
enough, the addition of a veal joint, 
cracked open, will contribute delicacy 
and nutrition. 

Soup stock which has "jellied" may 
be kept sv/eet for several days. Vege- 
tables and cereals should never be 
added until the stock is heated for 
serving. Heat only as much as will 
be needed and do not put that con- 
taining vegetables in with the jellied 
reserve supply. 

The soup kettle should be of some 
enameled ware, or, still better, of alu- 
minum, as enamel chips and when the 
soup stock comes into contact with 
iron, a chemical action takes place 
which, while it may or may not be 
harmful, discolors the soup. Always 
keep the soup kettle tightly covered, 
that the delicate flavors may remain 
in the soup. 



1. HOW TO COOK MEAT FOR 
SOUP. 

After carefully wiping all meat and 
bones with a piece of damp cheese 
cloth (kept for the purpose), cut the 
meat into small pieces, crack open the 
bones, if your butcher has not done 
it for you, and put into the kettle and 
just cover with cold water. Allow it 
to stand for a half hour or so before 
putting upon the stove. Then heat 
slowly, just to the boiling point, skim, 
then set the kettle back where contents 
will just simmer from five to six 
hours. Never let the soup really boil. 
It may bubble gently on the back of 
the stove, but too much heat coagu- 
lates the albumens and makes the 
liquid cloudy. 

When soup is made from left overs, 
add a small portion of uncooked meat, 
or an uncooked soup bone, to give 
zest. In selecting meat for soups or 
stews, veal and pork are often com- 
bined, while a lamb bone gives delicacy 
to a beef stew or soup. One flavor 
should never prevail, hence the cus- 
tom of using a variety of seasonings. 

The spice closet should always con- 
tain peppercorns, whole cloves, bay 
leaves, sprigs of marjoram or thyme 
and dried parsley when the fresh is 
not to be had. These spices are not 
expensive and last a very long time. 
They should, therefore, be kept in 
glass jars, tightly covered. 

2. TO CLARIFY SOUP. 

The addition of a tablespoon of 
cold water, while soup is cooking, facili- 
tates separation of scum. 

If soup is not clear when done, hav- 
ing cooked too quickly, perhaps over 
too hot a fire, clarify as follows — 

Put kettle on corner of range, so 
that, though very hot, it does not 
boil. 

Break into a sauce pan two eggs, 
shells and all, beat into H a pound of 
meat chopped fine, and a half pint of 
water. Add, while beating, a quart of 
the stock, then pour the whole into 
the kettle of soup, stirring constantly. 
Allow it to simmer about 20 minutes, 
then strain through a napkin or double 
cheese cloth, placed over a wire strainer. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



51 



3. TO CLEAR A SMALL QUAN- 

TITY. 

A small quantity of soup may also 
be cleared with egg alone, by allowing 
one egg to each quart of stock. 

To a quart of stock, in sauce pan, 
add the white of one egg slightly beaten 
and the shell, broken small. Stir con- 
stantly, over front of range, to boil- 
ing point. Boil a minute or two, and 
set it back to simmer for_ 15 or 20 
minutes. Skim, then strain through 
cheese cloth or napkin thrown over a 
wire sieve. 

If the stock needs more seasoning, 
season before clarifying. 

4. VARIETY— HOW OBTAINED. , 

Many modifications of soups may be 
made easily by replacing in a puree 
one kind of vegetable for another, by 
game instead of fowl, by varying the 
garnish, the seasoning, and so on. 
The ingenious housewife finds no dif- 
ficulty in varying the daily menu. The 
general rules and proportions, however, 
should be carefully followed, that good 
results may be assured. 

Soups are divided into two classes, 
the clear and the mixed, or thick ones. 
Either of these may be lean or fat 
soups and the purees and cream soups 
are often made without stock. 

Soup stock, being the foundation of 
fat soups, and being useful in prepar- 
ing numerous sauces and dishes, such 
as croquettes, it is vi;ell for the cook 
to have it at her disposal, which is 
not difficult as stock may be kept 
fresh several days in an ice box, an 
earthen jar being the best container. 
In a very hot, stormy day, let it boil 
a little while, to prevent its souring. 
Keep stock in a narrow, deep dish, 
rather than a shallow one, that the 
"crust" of fat may cover it, as this 
protection from the air helps to keep it. 

A very good stock is made of six 
parts beef, two of veal and one of 
fowl. 

5. BEST SOUP MEAT. 

The parts of beef which are best 
for soup are the neck (best for in- 
valids), shoulder, shin, ribs, flank, 
round and legs. If the veal is omitted, 
be sure to add bones containing mar- 
row. The meat must be very fresh. 

When veal is used, the shin bone 
or hock is richest in gelatinous sub- 
stances. 



In using fowl for soups, select old 
ones, rather than chicken, for higher 
flavor. 

6. FAMILY CONSOMME OR 
STANDARD BROTH. 

5 pounds beef and bones. 
5^ veal hock. 

1 fowl. 

2 carrots. 
Yi turnip. 
1 onion. 
Celery. 
Peppercorns. 
Cloves. 

4 quarts water. 

Let cold water run freely over bee^ 
and veal, to wash from all impurities. 
Place in a kettle with cold water to 
cover meat well. Also add the onions, 
half of which have been browned in a 
bit of butter in small frying pan. Into 
the other half stick four cloves. Also 
add six peppercorns. 

Water should not come within two 
inches of top of kettle. Use a pot that 
is plenty large. Bring it slowly to 
boiling point and allow to boil slowly, 
skimming until clear. Add a table- 
spoonful of cold water, occasionally, to 
accelerate separation of scum. When 
clear (in about a half hour) add vege- 
tables freshly pared, and boil two 
hours longer. 

Remove the veal, add the fowl, cut 
as for fricassee, and allow soup to boil 
for another three hours. (Place kettle 
on corner of range so bubbling will take 
place slowly at one side of kettle only. 
This makes it easier to obtain a clear 
soup.) When done, remove top grease 
and strain through a napkin. Set the 
soup away and prepare the fowl for 
dinner. Braise it in butter, season and 
serve on a platter with boiled rice 
piled lightly around it. — (French 
Chef.) 

7. CONSOMME. 

3 pounds beef — poorer part of round. 
1 pound marrow bone. 

3 pounds knuckle of veal. 

1 quart chicken stock. 
Carrot 1 

Turnip \ J^ cup each cut into dice. 

Celery J 

Yz cup sliced onion. 

2 tablespoons butter. 
1 tablespoon salt. 

1 teaspoon peppercorns. 

4 cloves. 



52 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



3 sprigs thyme. 

1 sprig marjoram. 

2 sprigs parsley. 
J/2 bay leaf. 

3 quarts cold water. 

Cut beef in IH inch cubes, put it 
into a kettle with cold water. Add 
veal cut in pieces, and the bones. Let 
stand half an hour; heat slowly to 
boiling point and let simmer three 
hours, removing scum as it forms on 
top of kettle. Add quart of liquor in 
which the fowl was cooked and sirarner 
two hours. Cook carrot, turnip, onion 
and celery in butter five minutes, then 
add to soup with remaining seasonings. 
Cook \y2 hours, strain; cool quickly, 
removing fat, and clear. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 

8. BROWN SOUP STOCK. 

Brown soup stock is made as above 
with part of the beef and vegetables 
browned in butter or marrow to give 
color. Rinse the frying pan well with 
the water in which balance of meat has 
been standing in the soup kettle to 
insure getting all the delicate flavor 
and color from caramelized pieces ad- 
hering to the frying pan. 

9. TOMATO BOUILLON. 

Tomato bouillon is made the same as 
Consomme stock, with the addition of 
J4 can of tomatoes, or three small fresh 
tomatoes with other vegetables. 

10. FISH BROTH. 

3 pounds whitefish. 

3 pints water. 

1 sliced onion. 

y2 a sliced carrot. 

2 stocks of celery. 
Yo a bay leaf. 

4 sprigs of parsley. 
Yz a red pepper pod. 

3 cloves. 
Salt. 

Cut the fish in pieces and add the 
other ingredients. Let boil, then skim 
and simmer about IJ^ hours; strain 
and use as any stock. The vegetables 
may be browned in butter or drippings, 
thus giving a brown stock. The head 
and trimmings of fish with a little 
salted fish are suitable for soup mak- 
ing. The broth may be clarified for 
consomme or thickened with a roux 
and cream as for a cream soup; or the 



flesh may be passed through a sieve 
and added to make fish ^ puree. Fish 
soups are garnished with pieces of vege- 
table. — (Mrs. Janet McKenzie Hill.) 

11. JULIENNE. 

2 or 3 quarts consomme stock. 
1 carrot. 

Y2 turnip. 

1-10 cabbage. 

Y2 onion. 

This is a clear soup, the stock of 
which is made the same as that for 
family consomme. Slice the vegetables 
(which should be very fresh) into fine 
strips about lYz inches long, put them 
in a sauce pan with some butter, a 
teaspoon of sugar; allow to cook 15 
minutes. Pour the stock or consomme 
over, and allow all to cook lYt hours. 

12. TOMATO SOUP WITH STOCK. 

1 quart brown soup stock. 
1 can tomatoes. 
8 peppercorns. 
1 small bay leaf. 

3 cloves. 

3 sprigs of thyme. 

4 tablespoons of butter. 
Yi oi a. cup of flour. 
Onion 1 

Cdery [ ^ ^"P ^^^^ ^^^ '^^ ^^^^• 

Raw ham J 

Salt and pepper. 

Cook onion, carrot, celery and ham 
in butter five minutes. Add flour, 
peppercorns, bay leaf, cloves and thyme 
and cook three minutes; then add to- 
matoes, cover and cook slowly one 
hour. When cooked in oven it re- 
quires less watching. Rub through a 
strainer, add hot stock and season with 
salt and pepper. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

13. WHITE SOUP STOCK. 

3 pounds knuckle of veal. 

1 pound lean beef. 

3 quarts boiling water. 

1 onion. 

6 slices carrots. 

1 large stalk celery.

quickly to boiling point; drain, throw 
away the water, wash thoroughly bones 
and meat in cold water; return to 
kettle, add vegetables, seasonings and 
three quarts boiling water; boil three or

boiling and cook 20 minutes. Strain; 
add rice or barley and season with salt 
and pepper. 



14. WHITE STOCK. 

Chicken soup stock, also known as 
white stock, is made by slowly cooking 
a fowl cut as for fricassee, in the same 
manner as other meats are cooked for 
stock by putting it on in cold water 
to cover, bringing slowly to boiling 
point, and tnen simmering several 
hours, until chicken is thoroughly ten- 
der. Remove chicken, strain and cool. 
Salt the chicken just before removing 
from the fire, but add other seasonings 
when preparing to serve.

Soup Garnishes 



31. CROUTONS. 



Croutons are usually served in clear 
soup. Cut stale bread into small dice 
H inch^ or a trifle less. 

Fry in smoking hot lard until just 
a golden brown. Try one first to see 
that it browns at once without soaking 
fat.

enough to make very stiff dough; knead, 
toss on slightly floured board and roll 
as thin as possible, which may be as 
thin as paper. Cover with towel and 
set aside for 20 minutes, then cut in 
fancy shapes using sharp knife or 
French vegetable cutter; or the thin 
sheet may be rolled like jelly roll, cut 
in slices as thinly as possible, then un- 
roll pieces. Dry, and when needed, 
cook 20 minutes in boiling salt water; 
drain and add to soup. Noodles may 
be served as a vegetable. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 



vin 
Fish 



Fresh fish is a wholesome, healthful 
food and should be found upon the 
table at least once a week if possible, 
if the family diet is to be well bal- 
anced. 

In selecting, look for bright gills and 
eyes. as a test of freshness. The flesh, 
too, should be firm. 



TO CLEAN FISH. 



If the fish has not been scaled at the 
market, dip it for a few seconds into a 
pan of boiling hot water and the scales 
may then be easily removed. Hold the 
fish firmly by the tail, and, with the 
knife at an angle of 45 degrees scrape 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



57 



toward the head. If this can be done 
out of doors, drive a nail through the 
tail into a block or plank, and scaling 
becomes a matter of very few moments. 

To "draw," cut the fish open along 
the under side, and the entrails may 
be removed readily. Wash thoroughly, 
taking care to remove any blood clots 
which have settled along the backbone. 
Remove fins and the backbone. The 
latter may be done by cutting carefully 
with a very sharp knife, along either 
side of the bone, along the back, be- 
ginning at the tail. The entire back 
bone and back fin may then be slipped 
out, without cutting the fish in two. 
Nearly all of the small bones come out 
with the backbone. 

A fish thus prepared is much more 
enjoyable than when served full of 
small bones. 

For broiling or frying, the head is 
usually removed, although for very 
small fish both head and tail may be 
left on. 

Fish may also be skinned by using a 
sharp knife. Start the skin at the 
edges, along the slit made by removing 
backbone and, if fresh, the skin will 
come off quite easily. 

In boiling or baking fish, always have 
a grate in the bottom of basket or pan, 
upon which the fish may be lifted, to 
avoid breaking. 



35. 



BOILED FISH— FRENCH 
STYLE. 



Halibut, Cod, Bluefish, Salmon, Pike, 
Bass, or any fish, large enough to boil, 
may be prepared as follows, about five 
pounds being allowed for five persons: 

Clean and wash the fish, remove the 
gills and fins, preserving the tail. Place 
the fish in a kettle having a grate at 
the bottom. Add two carrots, one onion 
sliced, a pinch of thyme, half a bay 
leaf, six peppercorns and _ water to 
cover the fish well. Allow it to heat 
and as soon as it comes to a boil, set 
the kettle back where it will simmer 
about one hour, without boiling. 

Send to the table on a folded napkin, 
arranged on a platter. 

With boiled fish, serve potatoes boiled 
with jackets on in slightly salted wa- 
ter, carefully removing jackets before 
sending to the table. 

Boiled fish calls for Hollandaise, Ca- 
per or White sauce, served separately. 



36. SMALL FISH— BOILED. 

Bass, pickerel and other small fish 
from one to five pounds in size, may 
be boiled as follows: Clean and wash 
the fish; place upon grate in fish ket- 
tle and cover with boiling salted water. 
Keep boiling for ten or fifteen minutes, 
according to the size. Drain the fish, 
place it on a warm platter, sprinkle 
over lemon juice and two tablespoons 
of melted butter mixed with one table- 
spoon of minced parsley. Serve with 
boiled potatoes and White or Holland- 
aise Sauce. 



37. BOILED FISH- 
STYLE. 



-ENGLISH 



After cleaning, tie the fish in a piece 
of cheese cloth. Place your rack in 
kettle and cover with boiling water. 
Add salt and the juice of half a lemon 
or a tablespoon of vinegar. The latter 
keeps the flesh white. Three pounds of 
fish is usually boiled in about 30 min- 
utes and five pounds in about 45 min- 
utes. The time will vary with condi- 
tions, but when the flesh separates 
from the bone, the fish is done. 

Serve as directed for the French 
style. 

38. BROILED FISH STEAKS. 

Salmon steak, also halibut, cod or 
other steaks (one inch slices from large 
fish) may be broiled in the following 
manner: After washing and cleaning, 
dry the fish well in cheese cloth or a 
napkin, lay a slice into a deep plate, 
sprinkle each side with salt and pep- 
per, also olive oil (or melted butter if 
preferred), place upon a broiler and 
cook over a moderate fire, taking care 
to turn the broiler occasionally. 

When done, sprinkle each slice with 
a few drops of lemon juice and serve 
with maitre d'hotel butter, also with a 
lemon sliced, and a garnish of parsley. 

Small fish, such as bass, pickerel, 
pike, trout, etc., may also be broiled. 
After cleaning and washing, divide into 
two parts lengthwise, unless fish are 
quite small. Place the fish on a plate 
and sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
roll in melted butter (or olive oil). 

Broil as directed for fish steak, turn- 
ing two or three times until a golden 
brown. Loosen from the broiler, care- 
fully, with knife and fork to prevent 
breaking. Serve with melted butter and 
chopped parsley. 



58 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



39. FRIED FISH. 

Small fish are best fried New Eng- 
land style, which is as follows: After 
each fish has been thoroughly cleaned 
and washed, dry well by placing be- 
tween folds of a napkin and patting 
until water has been absorbed from 
them. 

Upon the meat board mix corn and 
rye meal (^ corn and J^ rye). At one 
side have a large deep plate containing 
beaten egg diluted with 2 tablespoons 
of water to each egg. 

Roll the fish in the meal, dip lightly 
into the egg, then roll in the meal again 
and fry in hot fat which has first been 
tried out by frying sliced salt pork in 
the frying pan. 

Fry the fish until both sides are a 
crisp, golden brown. Garnish each 
small fish or each half of larger fish 
with slices of lemon and maitre d'hotel 
butter. 

40. COLD FISH A L' IMPERIALE. 

Boil salmon, halibut or trout in the 
French style and let it cool in the water 
in which it was cooked. When cold, 
drain and skin carefully, placing upon 
a folded napkin arranged on a dish. 

Cook in boiling water, and sepa- 
rately, green kidney beans, green peas, 
carrots cut into dice, cauliflower sepa- 
rated into balls about the size of a 
hazel nut, season with salt, pepper and 
butter and dispose these vegetables with 
an eye to artistic color arrangement 
around the fish on the platter, garnish- 
ing with lettuce leaves and sprigs of 
parsley. 

Serve a caper or hollandaise sauce in 
a separate gravy bowl. 

Fewer vegetables may be used, if all 
are not available. Alternate mounds 
of carrots and peas, or carrots and 
beans, each little mound on a lettuce 
leaf, makes an effective garnish. 

Fish "left over" from boiling either 
the French or the English way, may 
be served in this manner. 

41. WHITEFISH. 

Whitefish may be broiled as directed 
for black bass or, if large enough, may 
be planked, as directed for shad. The 
latter is the ideal way to cook white- 
fish. When carefully done, a planked 
whitefish is a royal dish, does honor to 



the cook and, with its golden brown 
and garnish of lemon slices, parsley 
sprays and potato border, is highly 
ornamental. — (For Directions See No. 
47.) 

42. BOILED MACKEREL. 

(See No. 36.) 

43. FRESH BOILED COD. 

(See No. 35.) 

44. BAKED FRESH COD. 

After cleaning and washing, rub in- 
side and outside with salt, pepper and 
lemon juice. Stuff and sew up the 
fish, dredge well with buttered bread 
crumbs and bake for 45 to 55 minutes 
in a moderate oven. Serve with either 
hollandaise or white sauce. 

45. STUFFING FOR BAKED FISH. 

To each cup of crumbs (half cracker 
and half bread or all cracker) allow 1 
heaping tablespoon butter, scant H cup 
boiling water, scant teaspoon "poultry 
dressing" or sage, H teaspoon salt and 
a little pepper. Prepare crumbs by 
putting crackers and stale bread through 
large meat cutter. Mix seasonings with 
the crumbs. ^ Melt the butter by pour- 
ing the boiling water upon it, stir it 
into the crumbs, which should be just 
moist enough to cling together for 
stuffing. Prepare as much stuffing as 
will be needed to fill the fish, following 
above proportions. 

46. BAKED BLUE FISH. 

Clean and wash fish, dry with nap- 
kin, rub inside with salt and pepper, 
stuff with dressing No. 45 and sew up. 
Place in a dripping pan on a fish rack 
greased, that it may be lifted out with- 
out breaking; sprinkle with salt, pepper 
and flour or fine bread crumbs, and into 
the pan pour ^ cup of boiling water in 
which 14 cup butter has been dissolved. 
Bake one hour in a hot oven, basting 
every ten or fifteen minutes. Serve 
with hollandaise or white sauce. 

47. PLANKED SHAD. 

Clean, wash, remove head and fins, 
leaving the tail in place and carefully 
remove backbone. Rub both sides of 
fish with salt and pepper and place fish 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



59 



flat upon the plank, with the skin to- 
ward the plank. Brush the fish well 
with melted butter and, all around it 
and about an inch or more from the 
fish and a little back from the edge of 
the plank, arrange a rim of salt. Lay 
it around with a teaspoon, keeping it 
away from the fish but piling it around 
well, to form a little "mound" entirely 
encircling the fish. This keeps the but- 
ter from running off into the oven. 

Have the oven piping hot and bake 
the fish 25 or 30 minutes. Remove 
from the oven, lay a little fresh salt 
over that on the plank, to cover dis- 
colorations from butter, mark salt in 
"herring bone" pattern, with a fork 
or skewer point, dot the fish with bits 
of butter, garnish with slices of lemon 
and parsley sprays, set the fish, plank 
and all, into a long platter and send to 
the table. 

Or, the salt may be brushed off and 
potato, previously cooked, mashed and 
seasoned, may be arranged with a "pas- 
try bag" to make an artistic border, 
the plank returned to the oven just 
long enough to brown the potato, then 
removed, more butter dotted upon the 
fish and the lemon and parsley ar- 
ranged ready for the table. 

48. PLANK FOR FISH. 

An oak plank, oval or oblong, and 1 
inch thick is required for planking fish. 
For a 4 pound fish a plank 18 inches 
long and 10 inches wide will be about 
right. Planks of various sizes may be 



bought for this purpose from nearly 
any hardware store, or they may be cut 
to order at any wood-working mill. The 
oval shape lends itself more attractively 
to the purpose. Every pantry should 
have its fish plank. This is a simple 
and inexpensive way to cook fish. Shad 
and whitefish are at their best "done" 
in this attractive manner. 

49. SHAD ROE— BROILED. 

Handle roe very carefully, so as not 
to break the skin which surrounds the 
eggs. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and 
melted butter (or olive oil). Broil and 
serve with maitre d'hotel butter. — (See 
No. 154.) 

50. BAKED SHAD ROE. 

Cook shad roe IS minutes in boiling 
salted water to cover, with yz table- 
spoon vinegar; drain; cover with cold 
water and let stand 5 minutes. Re- 
move from cold water and place in 
buttered pan. Bake 20 minutes in hot 
oven, basting every 5 minutes with 
melted butter. 

51. SHAD ROE WITH TOMATO 
SAUCE. 

Bake as above with the addition of 
^ of a cup of tomato sauce poured 
around the shad when put into the 
oven. After taking it out upon a plat- 
ter, pour another ^ of a cup of to- 
mato sauce around it. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 



IX 
Salt Fish 



52. SALT MACKEREL. 

Freshen salt mackerel in cold water 
to cover, allowing it to stand about a 
half hour. Drain, carefully scrape off 
skin, divide fish into fourths and put 
into sauce pan in which a pint of thin 
white sauce has been made. (See No. 
160.) Add % cut sweet cream or a 
tablespoon of butter, heat up a mo- 
ment, season with pepper and serve at 
once. 

53. SALT CODFISH IN CREAM. 

"Pick" the desired amount of fish 
into small pieces, freshen by allowing 



it to stand a few moments in cold 
water, drain and add to thin white 
sauce made as for salt mackerel. Do 
not add salt fish to white sauce until 
ready to serve or it may "curdle." If 
convenient, serve with hard-boiled eggs 
cut into halves and laid attractively 
around upon the top of the sauce. Or, 
one egg may be beaten and added to 
the sauce, after fish has been added, 
just before removing from the stove. 

54. CODFISH BALLS. 

1 cup codfish. 

2y2 cups mashed potatoes. 

1 egg. 



60 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



J^ tablespoon butter. 

ys teaspoon pepper and salt. 

Pick salted codfish into small bits, 
wash thoroughly with cold water, then 
drain. There should be 1 cup of fish. 
Boil white potatoes and mash, in quan- 
tity sufficient to make 21/2 cups. Beat 
potatoes and fish lightly together, add 
the butter melted, a well beaten egg, 
% teaspoon pepper and a bit of salt if 
needed. When well beaten take up a 
heaping tablespoon of fish mixture, 
shape into flat balls, handling lightly, 
roll in flour, dredge with pepper. Pro- 
ceed in this manner until all the mix- 
ture has been shaped into balls. These 
may be made the night before and fried 
in the morning. When ready to cook, 
roll in beaten egg, then in flour, ar- 
range in frying basket and fry in deep 
fat until a handsome brown, _ This 
makes 12 fish balls of medium size. 

Some prefer not shaping the balls, 
simply dipping up a heaping^ spoonful 
of the mixture and dropping it without 
handling into the hot fat. 



Serve on a hot platter. Pass at the 
same time hot boiled potatoes and egg 
sauce. — (The Boston Cooking-School 
Magazine.) 

56. FINNAN HADDIE— DELMONI- 
CO STYLE. 

Prepare the fish as above, then sepa- 
rate the flesh into flakes, discarding 
skin and bones. For each cup of fish 
prepare a cup of cream sauce; i. e., 
melt two tablespoons of butter, cook in 
it two level tablespoons of flour, one- 
fourth a teaspoon, each, of salt and 
pepper, and gradually add one cup of 
milk. Reheat the fish in the sauce. To 
serve au gratin, put the fish and sauce 
into a buttered au gratin dish, in alter- 
nate layers, having the last layer of 
sauce. Cover with cracker crumbs 
(two-thirds a cup to a fourth a cup of 
butter) mixed with melted butter, and 
set into a hot oven to brown the 
crumbs. — (The Boston Cooking-School 
Magazine.) 



55. BOILED FINNAN HADDIE. 

Select a thick fish. Put flesh side 
down in a saucepan, cover with cold 
water and set to cook on the back of 
the range. In half to a whole hour 
draw to a hotter part of the range, and 
gradually heat the water to the simmer- 
ing-point. Let simmer from five to ten 
minutes, then drain the fish carefully. 



57. BROILED FINNAN HADDIE. 

Prepare as in the first recipe. Wipe 
dry, brush over with melted butter or 
olive oil. Then set to cook over coals 
in a hinged broiler. Cook on both 
sides, then turn upon a hot platter, 
and spread with maitre d'hotel butter.

zine.) 



Fish Fragments 



58. HALIBUT RAMEKINS. 

Fragments of boiled halibut may be 
served in ramekin dishes and make a 
dainty breakfast or luncheon dish. Rub 
the halibut through a colander or coarse 
sieve, season with salt, lemon juice 
and a dash of paprika. For a half 
pound of the halibut meat allow a 
scant quarter of a cup of thick cream 
or white sauce, l4 teaspoon of salt, a 
scant tablespoon of lemon juice and the 
white of one large egg beaten stiff. 
After seasoning the fish, add the cream 
whipped stiff, also the white of the egg 
beaten dry. 

Any small dishes which will bear 
heat and which hold about half a cup 



may be used as ramekin dishes. These 
little dishes may be purchased in many 
quaint and pretty designs. Each dish 
is usually accompanied by a saucer 
upon which the hot ramekin dish may 
be set when sending to the table. 

Butter the ramekin dishes and fill 
about three-fourths full, and brush 
over the top of the mixture with 
melted butter. Set the ramekin dishes 
into a shallow pan containing hot wa- 
ter, which comes about half way up 
the sides of the dishes. Bake 20 min- 
utes in a moderate oven and serve in 
the ramekin molds; or slip the rame- 
kins out, arrange on a platter, and 
serve with white or Hollandaise sauce.

59. SALMON CROQUETTES. 

"Pick" cold Salmon into small bits, 
enough to make two even cups piled in 
lightly. Turn salmon into a deep plate, 
season with a dash or two of paprika, 
a teaspoon of lemon juice, a pinch of 
salt; then mix thoroughly with a scant 
cup of thick white sauce. 

Shape into croquettes, roll in cracker 
crumbs or crumbs from very dry bread. 
Then roll each croquette in beaten egg, 
diluted with two tablespoons of cold 
water; then roll in the crumbs again 
and fry in smoking hot fat, to a golden 
brown. Drain upon brown paper, gar- 
nish with parsley and lemon slices. 

60. FISH RAMEKINS WITH 

CHEESE. 

Cold salmon, trout, halibut, bass, pike 
or any meaty fish may be used for this 
dainty dish, appropriate for luncheon 
or Sunday evening tea. 

Ramekin dishes may be used or in 
place of them scallop-shells — shallow 
fan-shaped shells, which are durable 
and attractive. Foi five persons, allow 
proportions about as follows: 

Cold fish, one to two pounds. 

Butter, 5 tablespoons. 

Flour, 2 tablespoons. 

Bread crumbs, 2 tablespoons. 

Grated cheese, 1 tablespoon. 

Stock, 2^ cups. 

2 egg yolks. 

1 small onion. 

Divide the fish into small bits; brown, 
in a sauce pan, 1 chopped onion with 
one tablespoon of butter; sprinkle over 
two tablespoons of flour, add the stock 
and season with salt and pepper. Next, 
beat in a bowl the yolks of two eggs 
with two tablespoons of butter; add a 
part of the sauce; pour all into a sauce- 
pan and do not ahow it to boil again. 
Add the picked fish, stir well and pile 



upon ten shells; or divide it between 
ten shallow ramekin dishes. Sprinkle 
bread crumbs over the top and grate 
American cheese upon this; sprinkle 
over two tablespoons of melted butter 
and bake in an oven five minutes. Fold 
a napkin upon a platter, arrange the 
shells upon it and garnish with parsley. 

61. SCALLOPED FISH. 

Fragments of fish, particularly white 
meat, are delicious prepared in the 
following manner: 

Make a white sauce with 2 table- 
spoons of butter, 3 level tablespoons 
flour, and 2 or 2J^ cups milk. When 
butter bubbles in sauce pan stir in 
flour and when mixed, add milk grad- 
ually; season with pepper, salt, J^ bay 
leaf, and a few grains of thyme; beat 
until smooth. Add 3 small tomatoes 
cut into eighths; crush tomatoes in the 
sauce with spoon; butter a small bak- 
ing dish; sprinkle the bottom with 
ground bread crumbs; spread in a layer 
of cold fish, picked into bits; add a 
layer of tomato sauce; another of 
crumbs; another of fish, then a thick 
layer of sauce; then one of crumbs and 
dot the top with bits of butter; sprinkle 
with pepper and salt. Bake until thor- 
oughly heated through. 

62. FISH FRAGMENTS— DELMON- 
ICO STYLE. 

Pick or cut cooked fish (salmon, hali- 
but, bass, pickerel, whitefish or almost 
any variety) into small bits or into inch 
cubes. Prepare a sauce exactly as for 
salt mackerel. When sauce is ready, 
add the cold fish, heat through and 
serve at once. 

If fish is finely minced, it may be 
poured over toast or shredded wheat 
biscuit. 



XI 
Oysters 



Oysters are at their best from No- 
vember to April and are said to be in 
their prime in March. From May to 
the first of September they are not 
desirable. 

Most people swallow the oyster whole, 
but the ancients always masticated the 
oyster as other foods, and it is said to 
have a much finer flavor and to be 



more nourishing when well masticated. 

The oyster is one of the most easily 
digested of all foods, particularly when 
raw, and is very rich in proteids or 
tissue building compounds. 

Oysters are usually served in the half 
shell or in a shallow plate, five or six 
being the usual portion for each per- 
son. A half lemon should also be 



62 



THE MONARCH GOOK BOOK. 



served with each portion, or vinegar 
to those who prefer it, also horseradish, 
salt and pepper. 

63. RELISH FOR RAW OYSTERS. 

Chop as finely as possible, one onion 
of medium size and parsley of equal 
bulk. Put these into a napkin, dip it 
into cold water, wring it well to remove 
the rank juice of the onion; then take 
out the mixture, add the juice of a 
lemon, a pinch of cayenne pepper, a 
little salt and enough vinegar to make 
it about as thick as prepared horse- 
radish. 

64. OYSTER COCKTAIL. 

The oyster cocktail, now most popu- 
lar as the first course of a formal din- 
ner, is made as follows: — chill oysters 
of medium size and for each 30 oysters 
mix lYz teaspoons of finely grated 
horseradish, J4 teaspoon of tobasco 
sauce, 21/2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 
1 tablespoon of vinegar, 1^ tablespoons 
Worcestershire sauce, 1^ tablespoons 
of tomato catsup and Yz teaspoon salt. 
Immerse the oysters in this prepared 
sauce and serve in low wine glasses or 
in sherbet cups, allowing about five 
oysters for each person. 

65. OYSTERS ROASTED IN THE 
SHELL. 

When oysters can be obtained with 
the sea's aroma still upon them, an 
oyster roast is a unique entertainment, 
affording a treat to those who have 
never tasted the cooked oyster at its 
best. 

Have a "piping' hot fire. 

Wash and wipe the shells and lay 
them, unopened, in the quick oven, on 
top of the stove, — wherever it is hot. 
When they open, they are done. Pile 
into dishes or pans and send instantly 
to the waiting guests at table. Rye and 
wheat bread or toast should be served 
with them, while each guest should be 
supplied with a short knife for opening 
the oysters, an oyster fork, also a 
liberal pat of butter, a lemon cut in 
halves; while horseradish, olives, salt 
and pepper should be supplied to each 
couple. 



A large pan should be placed upon 
the floor, between each two chairs, to 
receive the empty shells. The supply 
for each person should be unlimited as 
the demand will be great. 

66. CREAMED OYSTERS. 

1 pint oysters. 

1 Yz cups white sauce. 

Y& teaspoon celery salt. 

Clean and cook oysters until plump 
and edges begin to curl; drain and add 
to thin white sauce, seasoning with 
celery salt. Serve on toast or in pattie 
shells, ramekin dishes, or scallop-shells. 
— (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

67. FRIED OYSTERS. 

Use large oysters; drain in a colan- 
der and turn upon a thick towel. Fold 
the towel over the oysters and dry well, 
by patting lightly. Sprinkle salt and 
pepper over the oysters; have ready a 
kettle of smoking hot lard, a bowl 
containing about a pint of flour with 
which has been sifted a teaspoon of bak- 
ing powder; a bowl containing two eggs 
beaten and diluted with two tablespoons 
of cold water, and upon the meat 
board, a good supply of cracker or stale 
bread crumbs. Also have ready a wire 
dish drainer in which a piece of coarse 
brown paper has been folded, ready for 
draining the oysters after frying. Also 
have ready the heated platter or plates 
upon which the oysters are to be served. 
Much depends upon making careful 
preparations, working quickly and serv- 
ing at once. 

After the oysters have been drained 
and seasoned with pepper and salt, pick 
up each one lightly with a fork, roll in 
the prepared flour, dip into the egg 
batter, then roll in the crumbs and lay 
into frying basket. When the bottom 
of the frying basket is comfortably 
covered, fry the oysters. For this pur- 
pose there should be two frying baskets. 
Prepare oysters and fill the second bas- 
ket while tne first is frying, and so on. 
A second person should watch the kettle 
to prevent lard from taking fire and 
to remove oysters as soon as they are 
a rich, golden brown. These oysters 
will be crisp and puffy.

Meats 



Knowledge of marketing is best ac- 
quired by experience. Do not be afraid 
to ask questions. Knowledge is not 
gained by "pretending to know." Profit 
is sometimes gained by asking questions 
even when one does know. An accom- 
modating butcher is always glad to ex- 
plain from what part of the animal 
various cuts come, and for what pur- 
poses they are best adapted. This should 
be learned, also the appearance of vari- 
ous cuts when fresh and their color 
when of good quality and properly 
aged. 

Meat should be moist, juicy, firm 
and fine grained. If the quality is 
good, the fat will be almost white, 
firm, clean looking and dry — not yel- 
low, soft or oily. 

Always wipe meat as soon as re- 
ceived from the market, with a fresh 
piece of cheese cloth, carefully remov- 
ing all dust and clotted blood, put on 
a clean plate, cover with a bowl or 
clean cloth and set away from the air 
in a cool place. 

68. ROAST BEEF. 

^ The finest pieces for roasting are the 
tip of the sirloin and the back of the 
rump. Cuts from the ribs may be roast- 
ed, either with the bone in (called a 
"standing roast"), or boned, rolled and 
skewered, or tied. The best beef usu- 
ally has fine streaks of fat running 
through the "lean," 

Wipe the meat with cheese cloth 
wrung out in cold water. Cut away 
any bits of blood or dust which adhere 
to suet or lean. When thoroughly 
cleansed, rub over with salt and pepper, 
dredge with flour, put upon meat radc 
in roaster and sear over quickly in a 
hot oven. Then moderate the heat and 
bake^ more slowly until "done" as you 
like it — rare or "well done." 

Beef is considered best when some- 
what rare. Do not cook it until dry. 
Basting every ten minutes or so with 
fat from the pan or with hot water in 
which a little butter has been dis- 
solved, keeps it moist. 

_ Put meat into pan with the best 
side down. When browned, turn it, to 
complete roasting. This brings it out 
with the best side up and handsomely 



browned. A covered roaster retains 
flavors and juices best. 

69. BROWN GRAVY. 

After removing meat from roaster, 
dip off as much fat as possible, add 
about half a cup of boiling water, 
work the spoon over bottom and sides 
of pan to loosen the caramelized brown 
which gives flavor, thicken slightly with 
a smooth paste made by mixing a 
tablespoonful of flour, a pinch of salt 
and a little water; allow gravy to bub- 
ble upon top of stove for two or three 
minutes, season with pepper and strain 
into gravy bowl. 

70. YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

1 cup flour. 

% teaspoon salt. 

1 cup milk. 

2 eggs. 

Sift salt with the flour, stir in milk, 
a little at a time, forming a smooth 
paste. Beat and add the eggs. Use a 
shallow square cake pan or small drip- 
ping pan; heat it very hot and brush 
inside with fat from the pan in which 
beef is being roasted. Pour in mix- 
ture, about H inch deep. Bake in hot 
oven about 20 minutes. When well 
risen and set (in about 15 minutes) 
baste with some of the drippings from 
meat pan. Cut in squares and serve 
around the roast. 

The English way is to bake the 
Yorkshire pudding in the roaster by 
pouring it into the pan, under the 
meat. Basting in a separate pan pro- 
duces quite as good results, however, 
and still leaves the pan drippings for 
gravy. 

71. COLD ROAST BEEF. 

Slice thin and serve cold, arranging 
the slices attractively upon a platter 
and garnish v/ith parsley. 

Serve with this white sauce, boiled 
potatoes and a green vegetable. 

72. COMPOTE OF BEEF. 

Slice and cut rather small, the re- 
maining fragments of roast. Re-heat 
the brown gravy, saved for this pur- 



64 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



pose, letting it bubble up until very 
hot. Add a little boiling water if the 
quantity is not as much as desired, or 
a little milk and a bit of butter. Ar- 
range meat upon a hot platter, pour on 
the boiling hot gravy and serve at 
once. 

With this serving have baked pota- 
toes, a green vegetable and, if con- 
venient, sliced tomatoes. 

73. BRAISED BEEF. 

Fragments of beef may be quickly 
braised in butter or beef drippings and 
served with baked potatoes and a white 
sauce. 

74. BREAKFAST BEEF. 

Mince fragments of beef in meat 
chopper. Melt a tablespoon of butter 
or beef drippings in frying pan, add 
the minced meat, salt and pepper. 
Brown quickly and add a cup of milk, 
a bit of rich cream if convenient, or 
a bit of butter. Pour over freshly 
toasted bread or shredded wheat bis- 
cuit. 

75. HUNGARIAN TIMBALE. 

Chop Yi pound cooked beef in the 
meat chopper; add a tablespoon of 
grated onion; season with celery salt 
and pepper; add enough tomato sauce 
to moisten and then mix in ^ pint of 
bread crumbs; have ready 2J^ cups of 
boiled rice, seasoned with salt and a 
little butter, and mixed with the beaten 
white of one egg. Line a small but- 
tered baking dish with a cup and a half 
of the rice, fill with meat. Cover with 
remaining rice; set baking dish into a 
pan of hot water and bake Yz hour in 
a moderate oven; serve with tomato 
sauce. 

76. POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

Six or seven pounds from the top 
of the round make the best pot roast. 
Solid meat that is without much bone 
and not too much fat, is preferable. 

Skewer or tie the meat into good 
shape and rub with salt and pepper. 

Into a large iron frying pan put a 
piece of beef suet, the size of a large 
egg, 5 peppercorns, 2 cloves, a_ bay 
leaf, half an onion, sliced, a sprig of 
parsley and a carrot sliced. Fry these, 
covered, while the suet is being "tried 
out" — about 6 or 8 minutes. By this 



time the pan should be piping hot. Re- 
move seasonings with a spoon and put 
them into the large pot in which meat 
is to be cooked. 

Brown the meat on all sides in the 
seasoned "drippings" in frying pan. 
Remove meat to the large pot, rinse 
frying pan well with a little boiling 
water and empty into the meat pot. 
Half cover the meat with boiling water 
and allow to simmer until tender. 

If the water has been well evapo- 
rated leaving but little liquid in the pot, 
a brown gravy may be made by thick- 
ening a little with flour and water. 
Cook a moment, strain and season with 
a little pepper. 

Garnish with any desired vegetable, 
these having been cooked separately, 
arranging them in attractive little 
mounds around the meat. Peas and 
carrots, cauliflower and peas, cauli- 
flower and beet, peas and turnip, etc., 
make desirable combinations. 

Remember, the parsley garnish is al- 
ways attractive. 

77. BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

The choicest steaks are the club or 
Delmonico cut, also known as "short 
steaks," sirloin, porterhouse and ten- 
derloin. The top (upper side) of the 
round also makes very good steak. 

The entire slice of the round may be 
purchased to better advantage, and the 
top side and bone used for steak, 
while the lower side may be ground 
in your meat chopper and used for 
meat balls or Hamburg steak. Meat for 
steaks should be at least one inch thick. 
Many like them an inch and a half. A 
good inch is about right. 

Wipe the steak with a damp cloth, 
trim off superfluous fat, pound a little 
with wooden pestle; grease the broiler 
by rubbing with suet, arrange steak in 
it and hold very close to glowing coals. 
Count seven and turn; count seven 
and turn again; count seven and turn 
once more, count seven once more and 
hold a little further from the coals, 
the outside being seared over to hold 
the juices. Cook about two and a 
half or three minutes, turn and cook 
about the same length of time. Six 
or eight minutes over the right fire 
should broil a steak which should be 
delicately rare in the center. 

Serve steak on a hot platter, sprinkle 
with salt, spread with maitre d'hotel 
butter, garnish with slices of lemon 
and sprays of water cress or parsley. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



65 



78. PAN BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

If one prefers a steak cooked in the 
pan, prepare and serve exactly as for 
broiling. 

Use a cast iron frying pan and have 
it very hot. Grease with suet, put in 
the steak, count ten, lift steak from 
pan, count ten while pan heats, turn 
steak into pan again, count ten, lift 
steak and count ten, turn steak into 
pan again and fry about five minutes 
upon each side. It should be cooked 
about as much as when broiled. Three 
or four tablespoons of water may be 
used to rinse the frying pan well and 
this rich liquid poured upon the steak 
which has been spread with maitre 
d'hotel butter. 

79. FRENCH SAUTE OF TENDER- 
LOIN. 

2 pounds beef tenderloin or steak 
cut thick. 

1 onion. 

3 tablespoons of butter. 

1 tablespoon of flour. 

2 cups of cream. 

2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce. 

1 tablespoon chopped parsley. 

Cut the beef into slices about the size 
of a half dollar and a quarter inch 
thick. Chop the onion and brown in 
a sauce pan with the butter; add sliced 
meat and fry five minutes; sprinkle 
over with flour, add the cream and 
Worcestershire sauce; add the chopped 
parsley. Cook for two or three mo- 
ments and serve in a warmed vege- 
table dish, or deep platter. Garnish 
with olives. 



80. FILLET OF BEEF WITH PEAS. 

2 pounds of beef tenderloin or steak. 

2 tablespoons of butter. 

Scant tablespoon of flour. 

J^ of a cup stock. 

Slice the tenderloin about one inch 
thick or cut the steak into one inch 
strips about two inches long. Brown 
in butter in a frying pan for seven 
minutes or so. Place on a hot plat- 
ter and set into warming oven. To 
the juice and butter in frying pan, add 
the flour, stock (in the absence of stock 
water may be used), boil up well and 
pour this sauce over the steak. With 
this, serve French peas in a separate 
vegetable dish. 



8L BEEF TENDERLOIN WITH 
TOMATO SAUCE. 

2 pounds beef tenderloin or steak. 
1^ tablespoons of butter. 

5^ of a cup stock. 

3 tablespoons of tomato catsup. 

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. 

Prepare as for Fillet of Beef. When 
the beef has been removed to the plat- 
ter, also add to the contents of frying 
pan the tomato catsup, Worcestershire 
sauce and stock. Boil for 5 minutes 
and pour over the meat. 

82. MEAT BALLS. 

The lower side and vein end of 
round steak may be used for meat 
balls which are very nutritious and 
easily digested. 

Use the meat cutter and cut the 
steak using little or no fat. Salt the 
meat slightly and shape with the hands 
into two inch balls, flatten to about 
one inch thick and fry quickly in a very 
hot pan, greased with suet. Some 
persons with delicate stomachs can eat 
these meat balls just barely seared 
over, but not cooked more, when other 
foods are quite indigestible. 

When well browned and served with 
maitre d'hotel butter, and gravy from 
the pan, and garnished with sliced 
lemon and parsley, they are very palat- 
able. 

83. HAMBURG STEAK. 

Chop meat as for meat balls. In each 
pound of beef allow a tablespoon of 
chopped onion, also salt (about a half 
teaspoon). Shape, cook and serve as 
for meat balls. 

84. BEEF A LA MODE. 

With strips of cloth bind six or eight 
pounds of beef from round, into cir- 
cular shape. Made incisions with a 
sharp knife and into these press strips 
of salt pork j/z inch thick and J^ inch 
wide. Make other incisions and into 
these press bread stuffing seasoned as 
for poultry. Heat drippings or trim- 
mings from salt pork and in this brown 
the outside of the meat. Add a sprig 
or two of parsley, 2 onions and ^ a 
carrot sliced thin; half cover with boil- 
ing water and simmer until tender. 
Five to seven hours may be required; 
replenish with hot water as needed. An 



66 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



enamel iron pot with tight fitting cover 
is the best utensil for this dish. 

A rack in the bottom makes turning 
unnecessary. Garnish with boiled onions, 
season, baste with butter and brown in 
a hot oven. Skim fat from liquid in 
which the meat has cooked. Thicken 
remaining liquid with flour and water; 
drain and serve as a sauce with the 
meat. Liquid should have been boiled 
down to one quart or less. — (Mrs. 
Janet McKenzie Hill.) 

85. BEEF STEW. 

For stewing, the chuck and even the 
neck may be used. These are inexpen- 
sive cuts, but, if the beef is of good 
quality and well aged, these are quite 
tender, cooked in this way, and are 
highly nutritious. Or, 5 pounds of aitch 
bone may be used. 

Have the meat cut into IJ^ inch 
cubes and the bone cracked open. Try 
out some of the fat in a frying pan and 
when very hot brown half of the meat 
by frying quickly until a caramel brown. 
Put all into an enameled or aluminum 
stew pot, just cover with boiling water 
(also add rinsings from the frying pan) 
and for each pound of meat add 3 
peppercorns, J^ bay leaf and one clove. 
Boil for five minutes, then simmer 
slowly from 2 to 3 hours, or until meat 
is tender. Those who like the flavor 
of onion may add a half onion, sliced. 

About a half hour before it is done, 
remove bones, most of the fat and skin. 
Then add salt and pepper and potatoes 
pared and cut into J4 inch slices. 

The liquid should have boiled down so 
as to not quite cover. 

Make dumplings (see No. 426) and 
cook for 7 minutes, letting the batter 
rest upon the meat and potato but not 
in the liquid. 

If desired, the gravy may be thick- 
ened a little after removing dumplings 
by adding a heaping teaspoon of flour 
made into a smooth paste by stirring a 
pinch of salt into the flour and adding 
a little water. The salt prevents 
"lumping" of the flour. 

Serve a stew upon a deep platter, 
with dumplings arranged upon a sepa- 
rate one. Green peas or spinach are 
desirable as a vegetable to be served 
with a stew. 



86. HUNGARIAN GULASCH. 

(As prepared by the Hungarian 
Shepherds.) 

Two hours are required for making 
this famous Hungarian dish. Pare and 
chop fine one small onion. Fry ten 
minutes in 2 tablespoons butter, tak- 
ing care not to brown or burn. 

Have ready IJ^ pounds of beef (part 
beef and part veal may also be used). 
The beef may be from the under side 
of the round or any other good but in- 
expensive cut. Cut into ^ inch cubes 
and add to onion and butter. Draw 
back from the fire and allow to simmer, 
closely covered, for 45 minutes. Then 
draw forward and add 1 full cup of 
tomato (either fresh or canned) salt to 
taste, a little black pepper, and yi tea- 
spoon paprika. More or less paprika 
may be added as desired, but if served 
in Hungarian style the gulasch should 
be hot. 

Now add boiling water to cover well 
and cook a half hour, then add about 5 
potatoes which have been pared, cut 
into H inch dice and allowed to stand 
in cold salted water for 20 minutes. 
Cook for 15 minutes after adding po- 
tato and add more water if necessary. 
There should be plenty of liquid, when 
done, to cover well. 

Serve at once. Some fresh cooked 
vegetable and lettuce salad combine well 
with gulasch. May be re-heated the 
second day and found quite as good as 
at the first. 

87. BEEF WITH ONIONS. 

2 pounds boiled beef. 
12 onions. 

3 tablespoons butter. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

2 cups of beef stock. 
Salt and pepper. 

Slice the beef quite fine and arrange 
in a shallow baking dish. Slice the 
onions and let them cook in a stew 
pan with three tablespoons of butter 
until a light brown. Sprinkle over a 
tablespoon of flour, add 2 cups of 
stock and allow to boil up a moment. 
Pour over the beef and bake one hour. 

88. BEEF NEW ENGLAND STYLE. 

Bits of beef or other meat may be 
nicely served in the following manner: 

Grease a small baking dish; cover the 
bottom with mashed potatoes; add a 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



67 



thick layer of beef or any other meat, 
chopped in the meat cutter; season with 
salt, pepper, a few drops of onion juice, 
and moisten with brown gravy and 
beef stock, or milk. Cover with a 
layer of mashed potatoes, brush over 
with beaten egg, dust with pepper and 
salt, and bake in a hot oven until heat- 
ed through. 

89. BRESLAU OF BEEF. 

2 cups of cold minced beef. 

Yi cup of stock. 

2 tablespoons butter. 

1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs. 

1 cup of cream. 

1 tablespoon chopped parsley. 

Yolks of 3 eggs. 

1 level teaspoon salt. 

J4 teaspoon black pepper. 

Paprika. 

Beat the yolks and mix all ingredi- 
ents thoroughly. Brush breslau cups 
with melted butter (any individual 
earthen dishes which will stand oven 
heat may be used). Press the breslau 
into the cups, stand them in a baking 
pan partly filled with boiling water and 
bake in a quick oven for 30 minutes. 
When done, turn out upon a platter 
and pour tomato sauce around them. 
Garnish with parsley. 

90. ROAST BEEF CROQUETTES. 

Season cold beef minced, in the meat 
chopper, with salt, pepper and a few 
drops of onion juice, Worcestershire 
sauce or beef extract, and for each cup 
of meat, two tablespoons of cracker 
crumbs and a tablespoon of melted but- 
ter. If not moist enough to handle, 
add a bit of beef gravy. 

Shape into croquettes, roll in crumbs 
then in egg, then in crumbs and fry in 
deep fat. Serve with white or tomato 
sauce. 

91. BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

4 pounds of beef round (or any 
tender cut. 

1 pound flour. 

1 teaspoon baking powder. 

6 tablespoons butter. 

1 cup of water. 

1 onion. 

6 potatoes. 

3 hard boiled eggs. 

1 egg. 

1 cup stock. 

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce or 
beef extract. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 



Make z. pie crust in which is sifted 
the baking powder; 4 tablespoons of 
butter, 1 cup of water and a little 
salt. Divide this dough into two parts 
and roll quite thin. Place half in a 
deep baking dish, taking care that the 
dough falls over the edge about Y^ 
inch. This to be folded over the up- 
per crust. Cook the beef as for Fillet 
of Tenderloin and when half cooked, 
place in a baking dish with three hard 
boiled eggs sliced, and the potatoes 
cut into Yt inch slices. Into the pan 
in which meat was fried, put 1 cup of 
stock, 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
or beef extract, salt and pepper; stir 
well and pour over the meat. Arrange 
the upper crust in place having first 
cut several slits to allow escape of 
steam. Fold the under crust over and 
pinch into place. Brush over with a 
beaten egg and bake about one hour. 



92. 



NEW ENGLAND BOILED 
DINNER. 



Wipe a four-pound piece of corned 
beef, tie into shape, cover with cold 
water in a large stew pot, and bring 
slowly to a boil. Boil five minutes 
and empty off the water. See that 
none of the scum adheres to the meat. 
Replace meat into pot, cover with boil- 
ing water and simmer slowly until ten- 
der. Partly cool in the water in which 
it was cooked, remove to a plate and 
allow the liquid to cool thoroughly, that 
the grease may form into a cake. Re- 
move this grease and, an hour before 
dinner time, put the pot of liquid back 
upon the stove. Add a cabbage quar- 
tered, a large turnip or two small ones, 
cut into half-inch slices, and 3 car- 
rots, quartered. In 15 minutes add ten 
or twelve potatoes, pared, and the 
meat. 

Meanwhile, boil two beets of medium 
size in the usual way, cooking them the 
full time required for beets. Ten min- 
utes before serving, put the beets into 
corned beef pot, to gather the charac- 
teristic flavor. If cooked together in 
the corned beef liquid, the salt would 
destroy the color of the beets. When 
all vegetables are cooked, take up cab- 
bage on separate dish and the corned 
beef on a very large platter with part 
of the vegetables arranged around it. 

More vegetables than needed for din- 
ner are usually cooked in order to have 
plenty of material for the famous "New 
England Hash" for the next morning's 
breakfast.

THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



93. NEW ENGLAND HASH. 

Chop in the meat cutter enough to 
make 1J4 cups chopped corned beef, 
lYz cups potatoes, 5^ cup turnip, a bit 
of carrot and a heaping cup of beets. 
Plenty of beets make this hash most 
delicious. 

Melt 2 tablespoons of butter or beef 
drippings in frying pan, having pan 
very hot. Moisten chopped ingredi- 
ents with a half cup of milk, add a bit 
of pepper, turn into buttered pan and 
cook over hot fire 3 or 4 minutes. Do 
not stir. Remove to a place not hot 
enough to burn. Cover and cook ten 
or fifteen minutes. Turn out upon a 
round chop platter (heated) and a 
golden brown crust should cover the 
hash. Garnish with parsley sprays. 

Serve home-made cucumber or to- 
mato pickle with this satisfying break- 
fast dish. 

94. CORNED BEEF HASH. 

Remove skin and gristle from cooked 
corned beef and chop the meat; use 
mostly lean. To chopped meat, add an 
equal quantity of cold boiled chopped 
potatoes. Season with salt and pepper; 
put into a hot buttered frying pan, 
moisten with milk or cream, stir until 
well mixed. Spread evenly, then place 
on a part of the range where it may 
slowly brown underneath. Turn and put 
on a hot platter. Garnish with pars- 
ley. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

95. BOILED TONGUE. 

Thoroughly wash a corned ("pickled") 
beef tongue. Cover well with cold wa- 
ter in a large pot, cover and bring 
slowly to boiling. Boil 5 minutes and 
pour off the water. Rinse the tongue 
with boiling water, pour this off, then 
cover with boiling water and cook 
slowly until tongue is very tender — • 
about four hours. 

Partly cool in the water in which it 
was boiled, remove tongue to a plate 
and skin it carefully, also removing 
small bones and fat at the base of the 
tongue. 

Cool the tongue and serve it, sliced 
very thin, with garnish of parsley, 

96. BEEF TONGUE— FRENCH 
STYLE. 

1 beef tongue. 

2 carrots. 
2 onions. 

1 celery stalk. 



Freshen tongue in cold water about 
four hours (water should be changed 
at least four times), place the tongue 
in a kettle with enough cold water to 
cover well; add the carrots, onions, 
celery, all sliced and cook four hours. 
Dip the tongue in cold water, skin it, 
put again into the stock in which it 
was cooked and as soon as it is warm, 
place in a warm dish with green parsley 
and serve with pepper sauce. (French 
Chef.) 

97. TRIPE IN BATTER. 

Dry pickled tripe by patting between 
folds of a clean napkin. 

Make a batter by mixing J^ cup 
flour and ^ teaspoon salt with J^ cup 
cold water added gradually to make a 
smooth paste. To this add one egg well 
beaten. 

Cut tripe into pieces about 3 inches 
square, dip in the batter and fry in 
about five tablespoons of hot beef drip- 
pings. 

98. CHIPPED BEEF IN CREAM. 

Break thin slices of dried beef into 
^ inch pieces. Cover with boiling wa- 
ter and allow to stand ten minutes. 
Drain and proceed the same as for cod- 
fish in cream. — (See No. 53.) 

99. VEAL. 

Veal should be first seared to re- 
tain juices, then given a long, slow 
heat until thoroughly cooked. It should 
never be served rare like beef, or it 
will be less palatable and much less 
digestible. Veal is not as easily di- 
gested as beef or as highly flavored, 
but it is delicate and therefore popu- 
lar. 

100. ROAST VEAL. 

The loin, the leg or the breast are 
the parts from which a roast of veal is 
chosen. The leg is both juicy and eco- 
nomical, also best in appearance, though 
for economy the breast may be selected. 
The shoulder, neck and fore shank may 
also be included, if a large piece be re- 
quired, the breast and shoulder boned 
and kept in one piece, making an ex- 
cellent roast, while the bones, the neck 
and the shank, with possibly a bit of 
pork, will give for the second meal, a 
most delicious stew and a liberal quan- 
tity of rich stock. This brings down 
the average price, as the breast (about 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



69 



6 or 7 pounds) usually sells for 15 cents 
a pound, while the neck, shoulder joint 
and shank are but 12 cents. From a 
good milk fed calf, the meat of all 
these parts will be found a delicate 
pinkish tint, the fat white and crumbly, 
the bones when cracked open, a hand- 
some red; while the flavor when cooked 
is delicious and the quality tender. 

For a plain roast, wipe off the meat 
with damp cheese cloth, rub over with 
salt and pepper, dredge with tiour, and 
place in a covered roaster. A thick 
earthen roaster is best for veal, as it 
transmits the heat slowly, holds it long, 
and keeps the temperature even — just 
the conditions best adapted to slow 
roasting. Into the roaster pour a cup 
of boiling water in which a large table- 
spoon of butter has been dissolved, 
coyer, and put into a hot oven, moder- 
ating the heat after ten or fifteen min- 
utes, and roast slowly, allowing from 
two to four hours, according to size. 
Put the veal into the roaster with the 
best side down, and turn when about 
half done, to brown the best side last. 

In an iron roaster, veal should be 
basted every 15 or 20 minutes, but in 
the earthen roaster or "Dutch oven" 
the veal need be basted only 2 or 3 
times as the steam bastes it sufficiently. 
With this roaster, veal may be put in 
before church and, with a moderate 
fire, safely left to roast itself while the 
family attends service. 

101. STUFFED VEAL. 

If boned, the cavity left by the bone 
may be filled with stuffing made as for 
poultry. A bit of grated lemon peel 
may be added to veal stuffing if de- 
sired. Tie securely with strips of fresh, 
old linen and prepare and roast as di- 
rected above. 

102. VEAL GRAVY. 

If there is much fat in the pan 
drippings, dip off most of it .after re- 
moving the meat, add a little hot water, 
rinse well the sides of the roaster to 
dissolve the rich, brown, caramelized 
bits which give flavor. Thicken very 
slightly with a smooth paste made of 
flour, a bit of salt and water; cook 
a couple of minutes, season with a little 
pepper and strain into gravy bowl. 

103. VEAL POT PIE. 

Use the shoulder, joint, neck and 
fore shank (3 to 5 pounds). Cut into 



2 _ inch pieces, crack the bones, cover 
with boiling water, add 6 peppercorns, 
a bay leaf, 3 cloves, half an onion, 
sliced; boil briskly for 5 minutes, then 
simmer slowly for 2 or 3 hours. If 
desired richer, add a pound of fresh 
pork, part lean and part fat. If water 
boils away, add just enough to keep 
the meat nearly covered. When thor- 
oughly done, drain the stock into sepa- 
rate vessel, catching' meat and bones 
in colander. Pick out and cast away 
the bones and superfluous gristle, ten- 
dons and fat. Replace in the pot as 
much meat as desired for dinner. Nearly 
cover with the stock, add potatoes pared 
and cut into 1/2 inch slices, and cook 
20 minutes. 

Make dumplings and drop with a 
spoon upon the meat and potato, but 
do not allow dumplings to rest in the 
liquid. If necessary dip out a little 
of the stock, cover tightly and steam 
dumplings 8 minutes. Take up the 
dumplings upon separate dish. Thicken 
gravy slightly, season with pepper and 
serve meat, potatoes and gravy in a 
deep platter or covered dish. 

104. VEAL PIE. 

Veal may be used instead of beef in 
making a meat pie with pastry crust. — 
(See Beefsteak Pie, No. 91.) 

105. VEAL CUTLETS. 

Veal Cutlets may be sliced from the 
leg, from the loin or from the ribs. 
Loin and rib cutlets are very sweet but 
have more bone. The leg cutlets or 
steaks are nearly all solid meat. Cut- 
lets may be cooked slowly in butter 
or beef drippings, being finally browned 
handsomely; or they may be breaded 
by rolling in cracker crumbs, dipping 
in beaten egg (diluted with 2 table- 
spoons cold water to each egg), then 
roll cutlets in cracker crumbs again 
and saute slowly in butter or beef 
drippings. 

Serve cutlets either with white sauce, 
poured around the cutlets or served 
apart, or serve a tomato sauce poured 
over them. Garnish with parsley. 

106. VEAL CROQUETTES. 

2 cups chopped cold cooked veal. 

yi teaspoon salt. 

J/^ of a teaspoon pepper.. 

Few grains of cayenne. 

Few drops of onion juice. 



70 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



Yolk of one egg. 

1 cup thick sauce. 

Mix ingredients in order given. I£ 
convenient use rich white stock in place 
of milk when making the thick sauce. 
Shape into croquettes; roll in cracker 
crumbs, then in a beaten egg, diluted 
with 2 tablespoons of cold water; then 
in crumbs and fry to a golden brown 
in deep fat. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

107. VEAL IN BUTTER. 

Slices of veal may be browned quickly 
in butter or beef drippings. Spread 
with maitre d'hotel butter and serve 
with baked potatoes and green peas. 

108. SCALLOPED VEAL. 

Proceed as for Scalloped Fish (see 
No.^ 61), having the cold veal cut into 
J4 inch cubes. 

109. BREAKFAST VEAL. 

Fragments of veal may be minced 
and served as in No. 74, for breakfast. 

110. SABLE ISLANDS. 

Mince veal fragments in meat chop- 
per, brown them well in butter, adding 
a bit of chopped parsley. 

Prepare a white sauce and have ready 
slices of toast or shredded wheat bis- 
cuit (if the latter, hollow out the top 
about a half inch). Pour boiling water 
quickly over toast or biscuit and quick- 
ly off- again to just heat and moisten, 
spread on bits of butter, dust with salt. 
Cover toast or fill cavities of biscuit 
with mounds of the browned meat, and 
pour the white sauce around and over 
the slices but not over the meat, leav- 
ing the dark islands of meat, each of 
which may be garnished with a tiny 
sprig of parsley. 

111. BLANQUETTE OF VEAL. 

Re-heat two cups of cold roast veal; 
cut into small strips in IJ^ cups of 
thin white sauce. Serve in a potato 
border and sprinkle over all, finely 
chopped parsley. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

112. RAGOUT OF VEAL. 

Re-heat two cups of cold roast veal, 
cut into cubes in Ij^ cups of brown 
sauce; seasoned with 1 teaspoon of 
Worcestershire sauce, a few drops of 
onion juice and a few grains of cay- 
enne. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 



113. VEAL LOAF. 

Separate a knuckle of veal into pieces 
by sawing through the bone. Wipe, put 
into kettle with 1 pound of lean veal 
and one onion; cover with boiling water 
and_ cook slowly until veal is tender. 
Drain and finely chop meat; season 
highly with salt and pepper; garnish 
bottom of mould with parsley and slices 
of hard boiled eggs. Put in a layer of 
meat, a layer of thinly sliced hard 
boiled eggs, sprinkle with finely chopped 
parsley and cover with remaining meat. 
In filling the mould, stand slices of 
eggs around the edge so they will ap- 
pear on the sides of the loaf when it 
is slipped out of the mould. Pour 
over all, the liquid in which meat 
was cooked. This should be reduced 
to one cupful. Press and chill; turn 
out upon a fiat platter and garnish with 
parsley. 

LIVER. 

Calf's liver is best, though beef liver 
may be used. Always be sure that liver 
is of a bright, clear color and that it is 
without spots or discolorations, other- 
wise it is diseased and unfit for food. 

114. LIVER AND BACON. 

Order calf's liver, cut into J^ inch 
slices. Cover with boiling water for 
five minutes. Wipe with a napkin or 
cheesecloth, dredge lightly with salt and 
pepper, roll in flour, dip into beaten 
egg diluted with two tablespoons of 
water, roll in flour again or in fine 
bread crumbs and fry in bacon fat 
tried out from thin slices of bacon 
which have already been fried crisp 
and laid aside upon a hot platter. 

Fry the liver seven or eight minutes, 
and serve with a piece of bacon and a 
sprig of parsley upon the top of each 
slice of liver. 

115. BROILED LIVER AND STEAK. 

Broil beefsteak as usual. Dip ^ 
inch slices of calf's liver into melted 
butter, broil over glowing coals, serve 
liver and steak upon the same 
platter, with maitre d'hotel butter and 
parsley garnish. 

116. BREAKFAST LIVER. 

^ Mince finely cold calf's liver and a 
bit of cold beefsteak; season with pep- 
per, salt and butter and heat in a sauce 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



71 



pan; moisten with cream or milk. 
Serve upon freshly toasted bread or upon 
shredded wheat biscuit. — (M. S. S.) 

117. MUTTON AND LAMB. 

Mutton and lamb are usually well 
done, though mutton may be slightly 
rare, if liked. Lamb, however, is not 
wholesome unless thoroughly cooked. 

Lamb is distinguished from mutton 
by the pink or reddish color of lamb 
bones, those of mutton being white. 

Always remove the loose, fibrous fat 
(or caul) around the outside of a leg 
of lamb or mutton, and, in mutton, strip 
off the pink outer skin. This will 
largely obviate the strong flavor, so ob- 
jectionable to most people. If fresh 
and good, the fat should strip off read- 
ily. 



118. 



ROAST OF LAMB OR 
MUTTON, 



Prepare leg of lamb or mutton as 
above described, wipe off with damp 
cloth, rub with salt and pepper, dredge 
with flour, arrange on rack in roaster; 
pour a cup of boiling water into the 
pan and set into a hot oven for 15 
minutes. Then moderate the heat and 
roast very slowly until thoroughly done, 
allowing from 1^4 to 1^ hours. The 
thick earthen roaster or Dutch oven is 
desirable for lamb and mutton. When 
it has been in 15 minutes, baste and 
cover. If the earthen roaster be used, 
it need be basted only once or twice. 
In an iron roaster it should be basted 
every 15 minutes. 

Serve green peas or spinach as vege- 
table, also a tart jelly, current being 
the favorite. 

119. CROWN ROAST. 



mings on each side in one piece and 
roll this over and over backwards.. 
When the ends are joined, a circle or 
crown of meat is formed. If neces- 
sary, trim the bones to make all of the 
same length. Cover the ends of bones 
securely with strips of salt pork. Rub 
with salt, set in a hot oven 10 or 15 
minutes, then reduce the heat, and if 
necessary to keep drippings from burn- 
ing add hot water. Baste with the drip- 
pings and cook from 45 to 60 minutes, 
basting often. Press a cup into the 
center of the circle of meat to insure 
its shape. To serve, fill the center from 
which the cup has been taken with green 
peas, blanched chestnuts, cooked tender 
in stock, Saratoga chips or French fried 
potatoes. A crown roast usually sells 
for 25 cents a pound, the flank being 
included in weighing the meat. Often 
the flank is not sent with the crown un- 
less by special request. As the flank 
makes up nearly one-half of the weight 
paid for, it should be claimed, being 
good for a stew. — (Mrs. Janet Mc- 
Kenzie Hill.) 

120. BOILED MUTTON. 

The leg or shoulder are the pieces 
usually boiled. Put over the fire, using 
a good sized pot. Barely cover the 
meat with boiling water, and boil about 
10 minutes; then simmer until tender. 
Season with salt when half cooked, a 
few slices of onion, carrot and turnip, 
or two or three stalks of celery may be 
added while cooking. When tender, 
brush over the meat with drawn butter 
sauce and sprinkle with fine chopped 
parsley. Serve with drawn butter sauce, 
to a cup of which two tablespoons of 
capers or chopped pickles have been 
added. The broth makes a particularly 
good tomato soup. — (Mrs. Janet Mc- 
Kenzie Hill.) 



A crown roast is the most easily 
served and at the same time is the 
handsomest that has been devised. It 
may be fashioned from a full loin, but 
is of more perfect shape when cut from 
both loins and fastened together at the 
sides. Cut the same number of ribs 
from both sides of a saddle of mutton, 
selecting ribs on one side to correspond 
to those on the other. Cut the ribs 
apart at the backbone, but separate the 
chops no farther. Trim the bones as 
for French Chops, remove the trim- 
mings to make the meat on the chops 
of uniform height, or leave the trim- 



121. MUTTON SHOULDER. 

Family Style. 

4 or 5 pounds of mutton shoulder. 

2 onions. 

1 dozen potatoes. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Place the shoulder in roaster and 
around it the onions and potatoes. Add 
a cup of water; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and roast for 1 or IJ^ hours, 
basting frequently. Serve on a hot 
platter with potatoes around the meat 
and gravy poured over it. 



72 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



122. BLANQUETTE OF LAMB. 

Take of mutton shoulder and brisket 
about 3 or 4 pounds, cut into IJ^ inch 
cubes. Place mutton in a small stew- 
pot with 2 tablespoons of butter. Brown 
well, add 2 cups stock or boiling water, 
6 carrots quartered lengthwise, 12 small 
onions, cook slowly 13^ hours, basting 
frequently. Serve the mutton with 
vegetables around it. Skim fat from 
liquid and serve separately, as a gravy. 

123. IRISH STEW. 

About 6 pounds brisket of mutton. 

10 onions. 

6 or 8 sprays of parsley. 

1 dozen potatoes. 

3 even tablespoons flour. 

2 cups of stock or water. 

Cut the meat into two inch cubes. 
Place in an enameled iron or aluminum 
pot; add boiling water to cover well and 
skim while boiling. Add the onions, 
parsley (tied in a bouquet) and cook 
for one-half hour. Add the flour beaten 
to a smooth paste with two cups of 
stock or water, and the potatoes cut 
in halves and cook for another half 
hour. 

124. SCOTCH BROTH. 

(see no. 30.) 

125. MUTTON OR LAMB CHOPS. 

Chops cut from the loin have more 
meat upon them. The rib chops, al- 
though largely bone, are exceedingly 
sweet, especially when cut from good 
lamb. Rib chops which have the meat 
cut away from the long bone, leaving 
the round portion at larger end, are 
called French chops. 

Slices, called cutlets, are sometimes 
cut from a leg of mutton and are 
cooked the same as chops. 

Loin chops should be neatly skew- 
ered into a round shape. Always trim 
off the outer pink skin and v/ipe care- 
fully. Brush over with melted butter 
and broil over hot coals, or grease a 
frying pan with a bit of fat and fry the 
chops at first slowly, until thoroughly 
done, then brown over quickly. 

Chops may be attractively arranged 
in many ways. They may be garnished 
with parsley and lemon slices, or spread 
with maitre d'hotel butter; or, as Mrs. 
Hill suggests, they may be arranged in 
circular form upon a round chop plat- 



ter and the center filled in with potato 
balls, French fried potatoes, potato 
chips, green peas, stringed beans or 
blanched chestnuts; or the chops may 
be arranged around a mound of chopped 
spinach or mashed potatoes. 

126. BREADED MUTTON CHOPS. 

Dip mutton chops in melted butter; 
roll in cracker crumbs and broil very 
slowly over the coals. The fire must 
not be too hot. 

127. LAMB CROQUETTES. 

1 tablespoon finely chopped onion. 

2 tablespoons butter. 
J4 cup flour. 

1 cup stock. 

1 cup cold cooked lamb cut into Va 
inch dice. 

Yi cup boiled potato cubes (same 
size). 

Salt and pepper. 

1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley. 

Fry onion in butter five minutes; 
then remove onion. To the butter add 
flour and stock and cook two minutes. 
Add meat, potatoes, salt and pepper. 
Simmer until meat and potato have 
absorbed this sauce; add parsley and 
spread on a shallow dish to cool. Shape, 
dip in crumbs, egg, and crumbs again; 
fry in deep fat. Drain on brown pa- 
per; serve with tomato sauce. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 

128. BREAKFAST LAMB. 

Mince roasted or boiled lamb, sea- 
son with pepper and salt. Brown in 
butter, adding a pinch of minced pars- 
ley. Serve for breakfast on buttered 
toast with heated cream poured over it. 

PORK. 

The best of pork is none too good. 

129. ROAST PORK. 

Pork is prepared for roasting in the 
same manner as beef, but should be 
roasted slowly and very thoroughly to 
be sure that all undesirable germs are 
destroyed. Dredge both meat and pan 
with flour. 

When roasted, dip off all fat pos- 
sible, from pan drippings, add boiling 
water for gravy, rinse around the pan 
well and, if not thick enough from flour 
in the pan, thicken a little more. 

Serve tart apple sauce with pork.

130. PORK TENDERLOIN AND 
SWEET POTATOES. 

_ Wipe pork tenderloin, pvit into a drip- 
ping pan and brown quickly in a hot 
oven. Then sprinkle with salt, pepper 
and powdered sage and bake 45 min- 
utes, basting every 15 minutes. 

Pare six sweet potatoes, parboil for 
10 minutes, drain; put into a pan with 
the meat and cook until soft, basting 
them when basting the meat. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 



131. 



PORK TENDERLOIN, 
FRENCHED. 



For five persons, purchase two good 
sized pork tenderloins, fresh and sweet, 
and have each tenderloin divided across 
into fifths and each piece stood on end 
and spanked flat with the cleaver. The 
butcher will do this properly when told 
to "French" the tenderloin. 

Frenched tenderloin may be fried 
slowly in butter until well done and 
well browned, and served with maitre 
d'hotel butter spread upon the chops 
and melted by their own heat; garnish 
with slices of lemon. 

Or pork tenderloins may be rolled in 
cracker crumbs, egg, and cracker 
crumbs, fried in butter and served with 
tomato sauce. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

132. SPARE RIBS. 

Wipe spare ribs with damp cloth, rub 
over with salt and pepper (plenty of 
salt), dredge with flour and put into 
uncovered roaster. Roast in a pretty 
hot oven, turn when one side is well 
browned and roast until a deep golden 
brown and crisp. 

Dip off most of the fat and make a 
white sauce by adding two heaping 
tablespoons of flour; cook on top of 
stove until flour and fat are mixed and 
thickened, then add milk gradually (one 
or two cups) until of the consistency 
desired. Strain and serve in gravy 
bowl. 

Garnish spare ribs with lemon slices 
and parsley and serve apple sauce. 

133. PORK CHOPS. 

Wipe chops carefully, rub with pep- 
per and salt and fry slowly in their 
own fat until thoroughly cooked, ten- 
der and brown. 



Remove chops to a hot platter and 
keep in warming oven while frying 
apples cut across into J^ i^ch slices 
and done in the pan in which chops 
were fried. 

Arrange apple slices around the chops. 

134. FRIED SALT PORK. 
New England Style. 

Cut sweet salt pork into J^ inch 
slices. Scrape the rind carefully. Fry 
slowly until a golden brown. Pork, as 
soon as taken from the fat, should be 
crisp and brittle. 

Pour off part of the fat, leaving 
three tablespoons. Add three table- 
spoons flour and stir until well mixed 
with the fat. Add a pint of milk grad- 
ually. Season with pepper and serve 
separately in gravy bowl. 

135. BACON AND EGGS. 

Bacon should be fried in the same 
manner as salt pork. 

Fry eggs carefully, two at a time, in 
the bacon fat, tossing the fat up over 
the tops of the eggs with spoon. When 
a milky scum covers the yolk and the 
white is just cooked the eggs are done, 
unless they are liked turned. 

136. HAM AND EGGS. 

_Ham should be cut into ]4 inch 
slices. Cut away rind and about half 
of the encircling fat. Freshen in 
tepid water, allowing to stand on back 
of range thirty minutes. Drain, dry 
in a towel, cook rather quickly, brown- 
ing on both sides, but be sure it is 
cooked through. 

Fry eggs in ham fat the same as 
with bacon. 

137. BOILED HAM. 

Soak a ham several hours or over 
night in cold water to cover. Wash 
thoroughly, trim off hard skin near end 
of bone, put into a kettle, cover with 
cold water, heat to boiling point and 
cook slowly until tender, allowing 
about one hour for each three pounds. 
Remove kettle from range and set aside 
that ham may partially cool; then take 
from the water, remove outside skin, 
sprinkle with sugar and fine cracker 
crumbs and stick with cloves, 14 inch 
apart. Bake one hour in a slow oven. 
Serve cold, thinly sliced. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.)

Poultry and Game 



Young birds are preferable for roasting 
and broiling. Older ones may be used 
for fricassee, etc. The yellow chick- 
ens and fowl are usually thought to be 
richer. 

Poultry should be moderately fat. A 
young bird may be known by feeling 
the end of the breast bone; if hard 
and set, the bird is a fowl; if flexible, 
it is a chicken. 

If an extra fine chicken is desired 
for roasting or broiling, ask for a 
capon. These are very fine in flavor 
and quality and, of course, cost more. 

Wash with greatest care, especially 
inside, removing the "lights" and all 
adhering particles of fat, blood, en- 
trails, etc. Pick out pin feathers and 
single by holding the bird over a 
newspaper crumpled and set on fire on 
top of the stove. Cut off legs at joint, 
just below the drum stick. Rub inside 
of bird with salt, pepper and butter, 
stuff, sew up, keeping a good shape, 
run two skewers through the body, one 
about two inches from the tail and an- 
other through the web of the wings, 
where wings are held in position, close 
to the breast. 

Cut off half of the neck, leaving an 
inch of extra skin, and tie this skin 
by binding white twine several times 
around it. 

Tie the wings into place by lacing 
twine around ends of the breast skewer; 
push the legs well up and cross them 
at the ends, lacing twine around th«m 
and around ends of the second skewer. 

While tying, lay a thin slice of salt 
pork under each wing and each leg. 
Rub the skin over well with butter, 
salt and pepper. Dredge lightly with 
flour. 

Support upon rack in roaster, breast 
down. Dissolve a tablespoon of butter 
in a cup of boiling water and let this 
stand on back of stove. Use this for 
basting. 

Begin roasting in a hot oven. When 
the flour has browned, reduce the heat, 
turn the bird breast up, and when 
browned on the top, baste. 

Chicken and young duck require from 
1 to 1^ hours to roast, fowl from 
1J4 to 2J4 hours; turkey and goose 



from 2 to 3 hours, according to size. 
Baste every 15 minutes. When done, 
remove all strings. Send to the table 
with garnish of parsley. 

138. GIBLET SAUCE. 

Save the gizzard, liver, heart, tip 
of wings and neck for giblet sauce. 
Cook all in one cup salted water until 
tender. Cast away neck and wing 
tips. Mince giblets in meat cutter and 
return to the liquid. 

When bird is roasted, remove from 
the pan, dip out any clear fat in the 
pan, add a half cup of boiling water, 
rinse pan well to get all the brown 
coloring, thicken slightly with flour 
(rubbed to paste with a little cold 
water), cook two or three minutes, 
season with pepper, strain into gravy 
bowl and add giblets and their liquid 
(the latter should have cooked down 
to very little). 

139. STUFFING FOR POULTRY. 

Make about as much as will be 
needed to fill the bird good and plump, 
stuffing at both ends. For each cup of 
cracker or stale bread crumbs (use both, 
mixed) allow % cup butter, ^s cup 
salt pork, chopped fine, J^ teaspoon 
poultry dressing (mixed sage and other 
herbs), J4 teaspoon salt, a little pepper, 
Yi cup boiling water. Add seasonings 
to crumbs and add salt pork, working 
it in with the fingers. Melt butter in 
the boiling water and pour over, mixing 
well. Stuffing should be just moist 
enough to cling together well without 
being soggy. If preferred, %. cup but- 
ter may be used and the pork omitted. 

140. APPLE STUFFING. 

Tart apples pared, cored and cut 
into eighths may be used for stuffing 
the center of the bird, packing the 
bread stuffing around it. The apples 
lend a pleasant flavor both to the bird 
and the dressing and are very palat- 
able. These will be found convenient 
if an insufficient quantity of the bread 
and cracker stuffing has been prepared.

141. BROILED CHICKEN. 

Select young and tender chickens 
and order them split open, lengthwise, 
on the back. Wash thoroughly, dry 
with a towel, rub with salt, pepper and 
butter and broil slowly until cooked 
through and handsomely browned, but 
not scorched. Serve with maitre d'hotel 
butter, slices of lemon and sprigs 
of parsley. Broiled chicken calls for 
French fried potatoes. 

142. FRIED CHICKEN. 

Use young chickens and cut into 
about eight pieces. Rub with salt and 
pepper, dip into milk, roll in flour and 
fry in butter until well browned. Serve 
on butter toast prints and pour over 
all the butter in which chicken was 
fried. Garnish with lemon slices and 
parsley. 

143. CHICKEN SAUTE. 

Carefully clean and wash the chicken, 
take off the legs and cut them in two, 
lengthwise. Take off the wings and 
cut the body into five pieces by cutting 
in two endwise between back and the 
breast; then cut each half in two cross- 
wise and split breast again lengthwise. 
In a large frying pan, melt Y^ cup of 
butter, add Yz an onion chopped; allow 
to simmer a moment or two, then add 
the chicken, sprinkle with salt and pep- 
per and fry over a bright fire from 15 
to 20 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped 
parsley and garnish with lemon slices. 



144. 



CHICKEN IN A SNOW 
STORM. 



Prepare and cut the chicken as for 
Chicken Saute. Soak the chicken in 
cold water for 15 minutes. Place in a 
small stew pot, with one onion sliced, 
a carrot quartered lengthwise and 3 or 
4 sprays of parsley tied together. Cover 
with water and allow to cook slowly 
until tender. Drain the chicken, saving 
the liquid, and place the meat in a fry- 
ing pan or large sauce pan in which 
has been melted a tablespoon of but- 
ter mixed with a tablespoon of flour. 
Stir well, and add through a strainef 
the stock in which chicken was boiled. 
Have ready three or four cups of boiled 
rice, seasoned well with salt and sweet 
butter. When ready to serve add to 



the chicken gravy the yolk of an egg 
beaten with a tablespoon of milk. 

Arrange the rice in snowy mounds 
around the edge of a large deep plat- 
ter. Pour the chicken and gravy into 
the center. Sprinkle chicken lightly 
with pepper. 

145. MARYLAND CHICKEN. 

Dress, clean and cut up two chick- 
ens. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Dip in flour, egg and crumbs; place in 
a well greased dripping pan and bake 
20 minutes in a hot oven, basting after 
the first five minutes' cooking with Yj, 
cup of melted butter. Arrange on a 
platter and pour over two cups of thin 
white sauce. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 



146. CHICKEN STEW. 

Dress, clean and cut up a fowl; put 
into a small stew pot, cover with boiling 
water and cook slowly until tender, add- 
ing Yi. tablespoon of salt and Y% tea- 
spoon of pepper, when fowl is about 
half cooked. Thicken stock with Yi 
cup flour, diluted with enough cold 
water to pour easily. Serve with dump- 
lings. 

If desired richer, butter may be 
added. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

147. CHICKEN PIE. 

Dress, clean and cut up two fowls 
or chickens. Put into a stew pot with 
Yi, onion, sprig of parsley and a bit of 
bay leaf; cover with boiling water and 
cook slowly until tender. When chick- 
en is half cooked, add Yi tablespoon of 
salt and Y% teaspoon of pepper. Re- 
move chicken, drain stock, skim off fat 
and then cook until reduced to four 
cups. Thicken stock with Yi cup flour 
diluted with enough cold water to pour 
easily. Place a small cup in center of 
baking dish, arrange around it pieces 
of chicken, removing some of the larger 
bones; pour over gravy and cool. Cover 
with plain pie crust in which several 
incisions have been made to allow es- 
cape of steam. Wet edge of crust and 
cut around the rim; rim coming close 
to the edge. Bake in a moderate oven 
until crust is well risen and browned. 
Roll remnants of pastry, cut into dia- 
mond shaped pieces, bake and serve 
with the pie when reheated. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.)

148. CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

1^ cups chopped cold cooked fowl. 

Yt. teaspoon salt. 

Yx teaspoon celery salt. 

A dash of cayenne or paprika. 

1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

Few drops onion juice. 

1 teaspoon finely chopped parsley. 

1 cup thick white sauce. 

Mix ingredients in order given. Shape, 
roll in crumbs and fry same as other 
croquettes. White meat of fowl ab- 
sorbs more sauce than dark meat. This 
must be remembered if dark meat alone 
is used. Croquette mixtures should al- 
ways be as soft as can be conveniently 
handled, when croquettes will be soft 
and creamy inside. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 

149. PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Boil one or two chickens in water to 
just barely cover; add salt when half 
done, and when thoroughly tender, 
drain, saving the liquid. Remove all 
the meat from the bones, cast away the 
skin and keep the light and dark meat 
separate. Chop each and season to 
taste with salt and pepper. Butter 
bread tin; put in a layer of light meat, 
then a layer of dark and so on until 
all is used. Add the liquid, which 
should be boiled down to about one 
cup. Cover with buttered paper and 
put on a heavy weight. A clean board 



cut to just fit inside of the tin and a 
brick upon this answers nicely. Tur- 
key may be prepared in the same way, 
slicing instead of chopping, and slices 
of hard boiled eggs may be used with 
either chicken or turkey. Arrange 
slices in the bottom and on the sides of 
the dish that they may come on the out- 
side of the mould when it is tipped out. 

150. SCALLOPED CHICKEN. 

Butter a baking dish. Arrange alter- 
nate layers of cold cooked sliced chick- 
en and boiled macaroni or rice. Pour 
over white, brown or tomato sauce. 
Cover with buttered cracker crumbs 
and bake in a hot oven until crumbs 
are browned. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

151. SCALLOPED TURKEY. 

Make 1 cup of sauce, using 2 table- 
spoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of flour, 
Ya teaspoon of salt and dash of pepper 
and 1 cup of stock obtained by cooking 
in water the bones and skin of a roast 
turkey. Cut remnants of cold roast 
turkey into small pieces. There should 
be IH cups; sprinkle the bottom of but- 
tered baking dish with seasoned cracker 
crumbs, add turkey meat, pour over 
sauce and sprinkle with buttered crack- 
er crumbs. Bake in a hot oven until 
crumbs are brown. Turkey, chicken or 
veal may be used separately or in com- 
bination. — (Fannie M, Farmer.) 



XIV 
Garnishes and Sauces 

152. JARDINIERE. 153. GOLDEN GARNISH. 



Jardiniere makes a suitable garnish 
for tenderloins, veal, mutton, etc. Take 
two potatoes, cut into very small strips 
and French fried; about 1 cupful, a 
cup of green peas, green beans, car- 
rots cut into dice or stripped small, 
lengthwise, and a cup of cauliflower 
cut into pieces about the size of a 
shagbark nut, each of these vegetables 
having been cooked separately in boil- 
ing salted water and then fried in but- 
ter. When the meat to be garnished 
is placed upon a long platter, arrange 
the fried potatoes at each end and in 
the middle of the dish; then tastefully 
arrange the other vegetables in attract- 
ive little mounds around the meat, al- 
ternating the colors. 



Use Y2 dozen small carrots pared 
and quartered ^engthwise. Place in a 
sauce pan with a cup of stock, and a 
tablespoon of butter. Cook until ten- 
der (40 or 50 minutes). When ready 
to serve add another tablespoon of but- 
ter; arrange around boiled mutton or 
other meats. 

154. MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER. 

To one heaping tablespoon of fresh 
butter add an even teaspoon of finely 
minced parsley. By working the but- 
ter with a knife on the inside of a cup, 
the parsley may be mixed in evenly. 
This is spread over meats or fish when 
served and hot, the heat of the meat 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



n 



being sufficient to melt the butter. For 
winter use, dry a liberal supply of 
parsley by tying in bunches and hang- 
ing downward until thoroughly crisp. 
Line a tin box with paraffine paper, lay 
in the parsley lightly and cover tight. 
For soups, these dried sprays may be 
thrown in whole, while for maitre 
d'hotel butter the dry parsley may be 
crushed with the hand and sifted 
through a wire sieve. — (French Chef.) 

155. SAUCE POLONAISE. 

54 pound of butter. 

1 hard boiled egg. 

Several sprigs of parsley. 

Melt the butter; add the egg and 
parsley, both chopped fine. Stir well 
and serve separately in a bowl. Par- 
ticularly nice with fish. — (French 
Chef.) 

156. PEPPER SAUCE. 

1 onion. 

1 carrot. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

1 cup vinegar. 

1 cup stock. 

A dash of paprika. 

Pepper and salt. 

Melt butter in a sauce pan; add onion 
and carrot chopped fine, and cook 5 
minutes. Sprinkle over 1 tablespoon 
of flour and stir well and add 1 cup 
vinegar, 1 cup of stock, a pinch of 
thyme, ^ a bay leaf broken fine, salt 
and pepper, and cook slowly half an 
hour; strain, add a dash of paprika and 
serve separately or poured over meat. 
This sauce needs to be highly sea- 
soned. It has been recommended for 
Beef Tongue Frangaise. 

157. HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 

J^ cup butter. 

Yolks of 2 eggs. 

1 tablespoon vinegar. 

J4 teaspoon salt. 

A dash of paprika. 

Yi cup boiling water. 

Put butter in a bowl, cover with cold 
water and wash, using a spoon. Di- 
vide into three pieces; put one piece 
in a sauce pan with the yolks of eggs 
and lemon juice. Place sauce pan in a 
larger one, containing boiling water and 
stir constantly with a wire whisk until 
butter is melted. Then add second 



piece of butter and as it thickens, the 
third piece. Add water; cook one min- 
ute; remove from the fire, then add 
salt and cayenne. — (Fannie M. Farm- 
er.) 

158. MINT SAUCE. 

Yz cup mint leaves. 

H cup vinegar. 

1 tablespoon of sugar. 

Chop the mint leaves; mix them in 
a bowl with the vinegar and sugar. 
Serve with leg of mutton. 

159. WHITE SAUCE. 
Mother's Way. 

Make a thin white sauce by thicken- 
ing two cups of milk with two table- 
spoons of flour (previously rubbed to 
a smooth paste by first mixing a pinch 
of salt with the flour and then adding 
a few spoons of water). 

This sauce may be used as the foun- 
dation for codfish and cream, macaroni 
and cream, chipped beef and cream, 
etc.; Yi, cup sweet cream or a table- 
spoon of butter with seasoning of pep- 
per being added just befoi-e removing 
from the fire. 

The thickness of the gravy may be 
varied by having more or less thicken- 
ing and the sauce may be further en- 
riched by adding an egg, well beaten, 
with the cream or butter. 



160. WHITE SAUCE. 

Miss Farmer, in The Cooking School 
Cook Book, prepares thin white sauce 
by first melting the butter (2 table- 
spoons) until it bubbles. Add 1J4 
tablespoons flour, mixed with ^ tea- 
spoon of salt (except for salt fish) and 
a little pepper. Stir flour and butter 
until thoroughly blended and thick. 
Pour in 1 cup milk gradually, adding 
about ^ at a time; stir until well 
mixed, then beat until smooth and 
glossy. The sauce may be made a 
little more quickly if milk is first 
scalded. 

This is a delicious sauce but requires 
2 tablespoons of butter to each cup of 
milk. Less butter may be used, how- 
ever, but Mother's way permits varia- 
tions as convenient, such as adding but 
a small quantity of butter or just a bit 
of butter together v/ith a little sweet 
cream, if that is more convenient. 



78 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



161. THICK WHITE SAUCE. 

For Cutlets, Croquettes, Etc. 
2H tablespoons butter. 
Yi cup flour. 
1 cup milk. 
54 teaspoon salt. 
A dash of pepper. 

Make the same as thin white sauce 
— (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

162. DRAWN BUTTER SAUCE. 

Ys cup butter. 

3 tablespoons of flour. 

IY2 cups hot water. 

Y2 teaspoon salt. 

Y& teaspoon pepper. 

Melt half the butter; add flour with 
seasonings and pour on gradually hot 
water. Boil 5 minutes and add re- 
maining butter in small pieces. To be 
served with boiled or baked fish. 

• 163. CAPER SAUCE. 

To drawn butter sauce add Y2 cup of 
capers, drained from their liquid. Serve 
■v^ith boiled mutton or with fish. 



164. BROWN SAUCE. 

2 tablespoons of butter. 

Y a slice of onion. 

3 tablespoons of flour. 
1 cup of brown stock. 

Y teaspoon salt. 

Y& teaspoon pepper. 

Cook onion in butter until slightly 
browned; remove onion and stir butter 
constantly until well browned. Add 
flour, mix with seasonings and brown 
the butter in flour. Then add stock 
gradually. Thin brown gravy will do, 
but brown soup stock is better. — (Fan- 
nie M. Farmer.) 

165. TOMATO SAUCE. 

Y2 can of tomatoes. 

Sprig of thyme. 

1 stalk celery. 

1 sliced onion. 

Bit of bay leaf. 

Y2 teaspoon salt. 

A dash of paprika. 

Ya teaspoon of soda. 

Cook tomatoes 20 minutes with season- 
ings; rub through a strainer; add 
soda, then the white sauce. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 



XV 



Vegetables 



Always have vegetables as fresh as 
possible, never wilted. Any decayed 
portions should be carefully excluded. 
Green vegetables should be crisp and 
any holes or ragged edges which svig- 
gest that a leaf has been worm eaten 
should be carefully cut away. Some 
insects leave a poison upon the eaten 
edge. 

166. TO KEEP GREEN VEGE- 
TABLES FRESH. 

Lettuce, cress and similar salad 
greens are best kept fresh by first wash- 
ing, as soon as received from the mar- 
ket; then wrap carefully cleansed leaves 
in a fresh towel wrung out in cold 
water and keep in a cool place. Wilted 
leaves may be revived by allowing them 
to stand for a few moments in cold 
water, then wrapping as above, exclud- 
ing the air. Lettuce can be kept per- 
fectly fresh several days in this man- 
ner. 



A small stiff brush kept exclusively 
for the purpose is essential in prop- 
erly cleaning most vegetables. 

Cook vegetables in boiling water, 
slightly salted. Salt helps to keep the 
color of peas, beans, etc. 

A small pinch of soda added to the 
water in which cabbage or onions are 
cooked diminishes the odor. 

Vegetables should not be covered in 
cooking. 

Do not allow vegetables to stand in 
water after they are done. Drain as 
soon as tender. If done before time 
of serving, cover and keep hot until 
ready to season and serve. 

167. ASPARAGUS. 

Wash asparagus, cut off a little of the 
tough end and scrape lightly with a 
sharp knife. Be careful not to break 
off the tips. Scraping removes most of 
the tough fibre and greatly improves 
asparagus. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



79 



In boiling, keep asparagus lying the 
same way in the kettle. After cleans- 
ing, the bunches may be loosely retied. 
Boil in salted water until tender (15 
or 20 minutes). Drain, season with 
butter, pepper and a bit more salt if 
needed. A few spoons of cream may 
be poured over, if desired. Serve in a 
hot dish. 

168. ASPARAGUS ON TOAST. 

The favorite way of serving aspara- 
gus is to arrange crisp buttered toast 
upon a hot platter, then lay the aspara- 
gus across the slices, having first sea- 
soned it with butter and cream; then 
pour the cream over all. This moistens 
the toast, a piece of which should be 
served with each helping of asparagus. 

169. BEANS. 

For fine flavor and nutritive quality, 
nothing surpasses a cranberry pole bean, 
which, when cooked, is a rich choco- 
late brown. 

In midsummer these are obtainable 
in the shell and may be boiled until ten- 
der and seasoned with butter, pepper 
and salt; also cream, if convenient. A 
cranberry bean is preferable for succo- 
tash. This variety may be dried and 
kept all winter. When the dried beans 
are used, they should be soaked over 
night; cook slowly until soft, allowing 
nearly all the water to evaporate. This 
leaves the rich flavor in the condensed 
liquid. 

Kidney beans, so called from their 
elongated shape, are similar to the cran- 
berry bean in flavor, and may be used 
in the same way. 

Lima beans are perhaps the most used 
in western markets and may be had 
all the year. They are cooked and 
served as cranberry beans, but are 
greenish white and quite different in 
flavor. 

Pea beans are the small white vari- 
ety known in every market and most 
used for baking. 

String beans are of two varieties: the 
green (usually the cranberry bean gath- 
ered while the pod is tender) and the 
yellow (butter) beans. 

170. BOSTON BAKED BEANS. 

Pick over carefully one quart beans 
and let them soak over night; in the 
morning wash and drain in another 
water, put on to boil in cold water with 



half a teaspoon of soda; boil about 30 
minutes (when 'done the skin of a bean 
will crack if taken out and blown upon) 
then drain. Into an earthen bean pot, 
first put a fourth inch slice of pork, 
then add the beans, filling pot about 
seven-eighths full; pour over two or 
three tablespoons of molasses. Into 
the center put one small onion and 
above this half a pound of _ salt pork, 
well washed, having the rind scored 
with knife into slices or squares. Ar- 
range with the rind uppermost, and 
the pork sunk in so the rind just comes 
to the top of the beans. Season with 
pepper and salt, a dash of cayenne im- 
proves them; cover with hot water and 
bake six hours or longer in a moderate 
oven, adding hot water as needed; they 
cannot be baked too long. 

Keep covered so they will not burn 
on top, but remove the cover an hour 
or two before serving, to brown the 
top and crisp the pork. 

171. BEANS WITH MUTTON. 

A leg or shoulder of mutton may be 
garnished with beans, prepared in the 
following manner: Soak 1 pound of 
white kidney beans in cold water over 
night. Drain and cook in salted water 
until tender (about 3 hours). When 
ready to serve, chop one onion, brown 
it in a tablespoon of butter, add the 
beans, drained, stir well and add two 
tablespoons of butter; sprinkle over a 
tablespoon of chopped parsley and serve 
in a dish separate from the mutton. 

172. LIMA BEANS. 

If dry, they should be soaked over 
night in cold water. Cook in boiling 
salted water until tender and season 
with a bit of butter, pepper and salt. 
Cream or milk improves them. 

173. SHELL BEANS. 

Cranberry, kidney or lima beans, 
freshly gathered, are known as "shell 
beans." Shell them and cook in boil- 
ing salted water. Always let the water 
cook down without scorching, leaving 
very little liquid. Season with butter, 
pepper and salt, and add cream or 
milk. 

174. STRING BEANS. 

Wash the beans and break oflf just a 
bit at each end, being careful to take 
the string from one side with each tip. 
Cut into half inch lengths and cook 



80 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



and season as for shell beans. String 
beans need to be cooked two or three 
hours. They should be cooked slowly 
and their water allowed to boil down 
two or three times. This will make 
them very rich and sweet. 

BEETS. 

Beets should be carefully washed, but 
never scraped or peeled. Do not even 
break off any of the little tap root, as 
this lets out the juice. Merely cut off 
tops an inch above the beet. Cook in 
boiling salted water until tender. Beets 
require from one to four hours, ac- 
cording to size and age. 

When cooked, drain, cover with cold 
water and skin may be easily slipped 
off. 

175. BUTTERED BEETS. 

Beets boiled as above may be sliced, 
slipped back into the pot or sauce pan 
and seasoned with pepper, salt and 
plenty of butter. Heat through thor- 
oughly and serve. 

176. PICKLED BEETS. 

Beets boiled as above directed may 
be sliced and covered with cold vinegar 
to be served as a pickle. 

177. CREAMED BEETS. 

Boiled beets may be cut into slices 
and served with white sauce. 

178. BOILED CABBAGE. 

In selecting cabbage, take one which 
is firm and heavy. Remove outer leaves 
until perfect and tender; remove the 
tough stalk, and cut into halves or 
fourths; cover with boiling salted water, 
add a small pinch of soda, cover and 
cook until tender. Season \yith salt, 
pepper and butter and, if desired, add 
a little milk or cream. 

179. TIP TOP PUDDING. 

Boil a firm white cabbage IS min- 
utes, then change the water for more, 
from the boiling tea kettle; when ten- 
der, drain and set aside until perfectly 
cold; chop fine, add tv/o beaten eggs, a 
tablespoon of butter, three of rich milk 
or cream, pepper and salt. Stir all well 
together and bake in a buttered pud- 
ding dish until brown; serve hot. This 
dish is digestible and palatable, much 
resembling cauliflower. 



180. STUFFED CABBAGE. 

Cut out the stalk end of a head of 
cabbage, leaving a hollow shell. Chop 
two pounds of uncooked beef with a 
slice of bacon and onion. Add one cup 
of bread crumbs, soaked and squeezed 
dry, one beaten egg, salt, pepper and a 
bit of mace. Shape into balls, arrange 
in the cabbage, add sprigs of sweet pep- 
per and steam until the cabbage is ten- 
der. Serve with tomato sauce. Cooked 
meat may be used by adding more eggs 
to hold the meat together. — (Mrs. Janet 
McKenzie Hill.) 

181. CARROTS. 

Carrots should be thoroughly washed 
and lightly scraped, but never peeled, 
as the best of the carrot is near the 
outside. Carrots are chiefly used as a 
garnish. Cut into very fine strips or 
"straws" and boiled until tender, they 
make a handsome garnish for lamb and 
other meats, or may be served in con- 
somme. 

182. CREAMED CARROTS. 

Cleanse carrots, cut into half inch 
dice, cook in boiling salted water until 
tender, allowing the water to boil away. 
Season with pepper, salt and a little 
butter; cover with a thin white sauce 
and serve. 

183. CARROT CHARLOTTE. 

Wash and scrape young carrots and 
boil them three hours with a slice of 
onion; season with butter, pepper and 
salt; mash very fine and beat; pile 
lightly into an oval dish and (prefer- 
ably with pastry bag) roll a border of 
whipped creani around the base. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

Always select a cauliflower that is 
clear and white without dark spots. 
Remove outer leaves, cut off the tough 
stalk and soak, head down, in cold 
salted water for about 20 minutes. 
Should there be any insect inside, it 
will crawl to the top and may be re- 
moved. Cook in boiling salted water, 
head up, until tender. 

184. BOILED CAULIFLOWER. 

Cook as above. Separate the branches 
lightly with a fork, season with pepper, 
salt and butter, and if desired, cream 
or milk.

185. CREAMED CAULIFLOWER. 

Cook as foi- boiled cauliflower and 
serve with a white sauce. 



186. 



HOLLANDAISE CAULI- 
FLOWER. 



Cauliflower is also delicious when 
served with a Hollandaise sauce. (See 
Sauces.) 

187. PICKLED CAULIFLOWER. 

Boiled cauliflower may be covered 
with vinegar, seasoned with pepper and 
served as a pickle. 

CELERY. 

Celery to be served as a relish should 
be white and clear. Separate the stalks, 
cutting off the stub, wash, scrape and 
chill in very cold water. The larger 
stalks should be laid aside for cooking 
or seasoning. These outer stalks, or 
the tops, are a favorite seasoning for 
soups. 

188. CREAMED CELERY. 

Celery should be allowed to cook very 
slowly. Cut carefully washed and 
sci-aped stalks into one inch lengths. 
Cover with water in a sauce pan and 
allow to gently simmer for about an 
hour, or until perfectly tender. Drain, 
season with salt, add milk or cream and 
thicken slightly with a smooth flour 
paste. 

189. BOILED CORN. 

Select tender corn having the ker- 
nels of medium size and well filled out. 
Remove husks and silk, break off the 
stub and cook in boiling salted water 
until tender (about 20 minutes). Drain, 
wrap in a napkin and serve upon a 
platter. 

190. SWEET CORN IN CREAM. 

Cut the kernels from freshly boiled 
sweet corn, scraping the ear well with 
a knife to remove the sweet particles 
adhering to the cob. Put into a sauce 
pan, season with pepper, salt and but- 
ter and add a little rich cream. When 
heated, serve. 

191. SUCCOTASH. 

Cut freshly boiled sweet corn from 
the cob as above described, being care- 
ful to scrape the cob well. For each 



two cups of corn, add one cup of cran- 
berry or kidney beans, which have 
been previously cooked until dark and 
tender, with a 2 inch cube of salt pork 
and water to just cover. Season with 
% teaspoon pepper, % teaspoon salt, 
1 teaspoon butter and j4 cup sweet 
cream. 

This is the ideal succotash of New 
England. Lima beans are often used, 
but are not as rich. Remember to cook 
the beans long and slowly, soaking 
them over night if dry beans are used. 
The water should be allowed to cook 
away two or three times until the beans 
are finally left with very little liquid. 

CUCUMBERS. 

Hold cucumber with the stem end to- 
ward you. Cut a thick slice from the 
other end, then pare the cucumber, al- 
ways paring and slicing toward the 
stem end. This is said to prevent the 
cucumber from being bitter. Then cut a 
thick slice from the stem end and cut 
the cucumber into very thin slices. Al- 
low to stand in cold salt water at least 
20 minutes before serving. Have the 
cucumbers thoroughly chilled. 

192. SLICED CUCUMBERS. 

Prepare cucumbers as above and just 
before serving cover with vinegar (half 
water if strong), sprinkle with pepper 
and salt and cover with crushed ice. 

193. EGG PLANT. 

Pare an egg plant and cut into very 
bin slices. Sprinkle slices with salt 
nd pile on a plate. Cover with a 
weight to squeeze out the juice and 
allow to stand one hour. Dredge with 
flour and fry slowly in butter until 
crisp and brown. 

Or, egg plant may be cut into J4 
inch slices and soaked over night in 
cold salted water. Drain, let stand in 
cold water a half hour, drain again 
and dry between towels. Sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dip in batter or in 
flour, beaten egg and crumbs and fry 
in deep fat. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 



GREENS. 

Several varieties of fresh green 
leaves are cooked and served as greens. 
These make a wholesome appetizing dish 
in the spring of the year. Small cow- 



82 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



slip or meadow marigold leaves, dan- 
delion, spinach and young beet tops are 
best. Any one of these may be pre- 
pared as follows: — 

Wash thoroughly in several waters; 
drain, cover with boiling water, add a 
little salt or a pinch of soda, either of 
which will preserve the color. Cook 
until perfectly tender, allowing the 
water to boil down until very little re- 
mains. Drain, season with butter, pep- 
per and salt. Serve with vinegar if 
desired. 

194. SPINACH FRANCAISE. 

Clean and wash Y^ peck of spinach; 
cook it for 10 minutes in salted boiling 
water to cover well. Drain and cool; 
when thoroughly cold, chop it quite 
fine. Ten minutes before serving, put 
the chopped spinach into a sauce pan 
with 4 tablespoons of butter, 1 table- 
spoon flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, Yt. tea- 
spoon of salt. Cook for IS minutes 
and while stirring add a cup of milk. 
This is delicious. 

LETTUCE. 
(See salads.) 

MACARONI. 
(See cereals.) 

195. BOILED ONIONS. 

Put onions into a dish of cold water 
and hold them under the water while 
removing the skins. This prevents the 
unpleasant effect upon the eyes. Soak 
them an hour in warm salted water, 
rendering the flavor much more deli- 
cate. Cook in boiling salted water, 
changing the water when onions have 
been cooked about ten minutes. Cover 
and cook until tender, having added a 
pinch of soda to the water. Drain, 
season with pepper, salt and butter, 
and add milk or cream if desired. 

196. CREAMED ONIONS. 

Boil onions as above and serve with 
a thin white sauce. 

197. PARSNIPS. 

Parsnips in the spring are best. Wasn't 
and scrape them and cook in boiling 
salted water until tender. Parsnips re- 
quire about an hour to cook; cut in 



halves lengthwise, they require less 
time. When tender, drain, season with 
pepper, salt and butter. 

198. FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Parsnips are nice boiled, sliced, dipped 
in a batter and fried brown. 

199. PEAS.

and nutritious of the fresh vegetables. 
Shell, wash and drain the peas. If 
they come from your own garden, 
wash the pods and cook for ten min- 
utes in boiling water. Skim out the 
pods, and add the peas, which have been 
soaked half an hour in cold water. 
Peas should be salted when about half 
done. Drain, season with pepper, salt 
and butter, and cream, if desired. 

200. PEAS AND NEW POTATOES. 

Prepare new potatoes as for boiling. 
Instead of changing to a second water, 
put the potatoes into the kettle in which 
peas are being boiled, add a two inch 
cube of salt pork and cook until peas 
and potatoes are tender. Drain, season 
with pepper, salt and sweet cream. 

POTATOES. 

Potatoes are usually cooked in boiling 
salted water. New potatoes are said to 
be better if cooked in two waters, hav- 
ing two kettles of boiling water upon 
the stove. Cook in the first kettle until 
about half done, using the frying bas- 
ket; then lift the basket from the first 
to the second kettle, making sure that 
the water boils, and cook until done. 

Old potatoes from which the mois- 
ture has partly evaporated, may be 
cooked in cold water. 

201. BOILED POTATOES. 

Boil them with the jackets on. 

Wash and thoroughly scrub with 
vegetable brush. Pick out or cut off 
bad spots and cook as above directed. 

Try with a steel fork and when done, 
drain at once. Never allow potatoes 
to stand in the water after they are 
done. Return kettle to stove and dry 
out all the moisture. Remove jackets 
and serve at once. Sprinkle with 
pepper and salt and roll in melted but- 
ter if desired.

Salads 



The salad is the ideal summer food. 

Possibilities for variety are almost 
endless, and the ingenuity of the house- 
wife may daily be used to produce some 
dainty, nutritious and thoroughly whole- 
some combination which will tempt the 
appetite as nothing else can do. 

Salad materials should always be 
crisp and cool if uncooked. When 
cooked, they should be firm to permit 
cutting into desired shapes without a 
mushy appearance. Materials for un- 
cooked salads, such as tomatoes, cucum- 
bers, lettuce, etc., should be washed and 
prepared several hours before needed 
and put very near the ice to become 
thoroughly cool. Cucumbers should be 
pared as directed (see vegetables) then 
either sliced or cut into J4 inch cubes 
and allowed to stand at least a half 
hotir in salted ice water. 

Tomatoes should be skinned and 
when to be filled with other materials 
should have a part of the pulp scooped 
out; then set them near the ice to 



become thoroughly cool and hardened. 

Lettuce should be washed, drained, 
and wrapped in a napkin wrung out in 
cold water, then laid near the ice. 

Celery may be treated in this same 
manner. 

221. FRENCH DRESSING. 

3 tablespoons olive oil. 

3 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar. 

y^ teaspoon of salt. 

Yz teaspoon of black pepper. 

Paprika. 

Put salt and pepper into a small 
china bowl; add the oil and beat vig- 
orously _ until well mixed. Add the 
acid (either lemon juice or vinegar) 
very gradually, beating constantly. 

Many who do not care for the flavor 
of olive oil can enjoy French dressing 
when more lemon juice or vinegar is 
used. _ This does not make as good an 
emulsion but is very palatable. If pre- 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



ferred in this way, use from four to 
six tablespoons of vinegar or lemon 
juice to three of the oil. 

The above amounts are given for 
proportions only; as much as desired 
may be mixed, keeping the quantities 
relatively as above.

This must be added drop by drop 
with constant stirring. When quite 
thick, add little by little and still 
stirring, the vinegar which should be 
of best quality. Continuing to stir, 
add drop by drop the remaining ^ 
cup of oil. The mixing should be 
done in a cold place. This will re- 
quire some practice but is the ideal 
Mayonnaise. Salad dressing should be 
mixed with a bone, wood or silver 
fork — never steel. — (French Chef.) 

229. MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

Add to two well beaten eggs, one 
teaspoon of celery salt, 14 teaspoon

Nuts 



Nuts have grown in popularity as 
their food value has become better 
understood. They are nutritious and 
wholesome and should be frequently 
used upon the home table. 

Almonds, chestnuts, pecans, hickory 
nuts, and walnuts are all desirable, but 
none is better for actual nourishment 
than the every day peanut, which most 
people like. Peanuts may be used in 
omelet, salads, gelatines, and peanut 
butter, is particularly good as a sea- 
soning for numerous vegetables such as 
peas, string beans, stewed tomatoes, 
etc. Pecans and walnuts are especially 
good broken or coarsely ground and 
used in puddings, gelatines and salads. 

259. TO BLANCH ALMONDS. 

Remove the shells and pour boiling 
water upon them. Allow to stand two 
or three minutes; pour off hot water, 
replace with cold, when the skin should 
be loose enough to slip off easily. 

260. ROASTED ALMONDS. 

Spread blanched almonds on a tin 
and place in the oven until a light, 
golden brown. 

261. SALTED ALMONDS. 

Blanch "%, a cup of almonds and dry 
in a napkin; fry a few at a time in 
frying pan, containing cocoanut oil or 
half butter and half clear beef drip- 
pings. When lightly browned, remove 
almonds, using a skimmer taking as 
little fat as possible; drain upon brown 
paper and sprinkle with salt; proceed 
in this manner until all are fried. 



CHESTNUTS. 
. 2(i2. TO SHELL. 

Chestnuts may be shelled and 
blanched by putting a teaspoon of but- 
ter into the frying pan and when 
melted, pour in a cup or two of chest- 
nuts, which have had a cross cut in 
the flat side of each. Shake the pan 
to Butter the chestnuts and set into 
the oven for five minutes. When 
taken out the shells and thin brown 
skin should peel off easily. Use a 
small vegetable knife. 

263. BOILED CHESTNUTS. 

When chestnuts are to be boiled, re- 
move the shells and cook in boiling 
water for ten minutes; then skim 
them out and cover with cold water, 
when the thin skin should easily rub 
off. They may then be returned to the 
boiling water to be cooked until ten- 
der when pierced with a fork. 

Boiled chestnuts may be served 
either whole or mashed, as a vege- 
table. They may be seasoned with but- 
ter, pepper and salt, also with cream 
if desired. 

264. CHESTNUT PUREE. 

Remove shells from chestnuts; cook 
in salted water as directed for boiling; 
when done, drain, mash and moisten 
with scalded milk. Season with salt 
and pepper and beat until light. 

This puree is used as a foundation 
for Chestnut Souffle (see puddings) 
or it may be served as a vegetable. — 
(Fannie M. Farmer.)

265. RAREBIT OF CHESTNUT. 

A royal dish for crisp October days. 

If you live within reach of the 
popping chestnut burr, invite a 
"goodlie companie" to help gather, 
then prepare this fitting reward, 
served from the jolly chafing dish. 

Shell and blanch chestnuts to make 
three cups when shelled, as follows; cut 
a half inch cross on the flat side of 
each, put chestnuts into frying pan and 
for each cup add a level teaspoon of 
butter. Shake well on top of stove and 
set into the oven for five minutes. Re- 
move from oven, take off shells with 
small knife, starting the inner skin, 
which will now peel off readily. 

Cook chestnuts till soft in boiling 
salted water. Drain, measure out a 
heaping cupful for garnishing and mash 
the rest (2 cups). Season mashed 
chestnut with salt and pepper and beat 
up light with a steel fork. 

The cup of whole chestnuts should 
be "deviled" as follows: 

Slip them into a frying pan with a 
tablespoon of butter and a half tea- 
spoon of beef extract; shake until well 
covered with the bubbling, browning 
butter and extract. 

Sprinkle with a dash of paprika and 
keep in a warm place until ready to 
use them. - The rarebit may now be 
prepared in chafing dish. 

For each cup of mashed chestnuts 
have ready 1 tablespoon butter, 2 ta- 
blespoons sugar, 1 cup thin cream, 1 
even spoon beef extract and paprika. 

Turn mashed chestnut into chafing 
dish, add the butter and beef extract 
and stir; add the cream and when 
just bubbling, a good dash of paprika. 

Pour at once over toasted crackers 
and garnish each serving with the 
whole deviled chestnuts (which have 
been kept warm in a little heated cov- 
ered dish). 



266. SALTED PEANUTS. 

Remove shells from unroasted pea- 
nuts; slip off inner skins or blanch 
peanuts as directed for almonds; then 
proceed as for salted almonds. 

267. PEANUT BUTTER. 

Shell and remove inner skins from 
roasted peanuts; grind in the meat 
chopper and rub to a paste with wood- 
en pestle in a bowl. Add a little but- 
ter gradually, enough to make peanut 
meal cling together. Season with salt, 
add a bit of paprika and put into jelly 
jar for use as desired. This may be 
used for sandwiches, omelets; as a sea- 
soning for vegetables and in a score 
of ways which the ingenuity of the 
housewife will invent. Peanuts give 
a fine flavor wherever used. 

268. NUT AND TOMATO SALAD. 

Skin and chill tomatoes from which 
part of the puln has been scooped; fill 
with peanut butter and serve upon let- 
tuce leaves with Mayonnaise. 

269. APPLE AND NUT SALAD. 

Break pecan meats into eighths; pare 
tart apples and cut into ]4 inch dice, 
allowing a good tablespoon of nuts to 
each apple. Mix nuts and apples well 
with Mayonnaise dressing; pile upon 
heart lettuce leaves and serve. 

270. PECAN BUTTER. 

Grind pecan meats through fine meat 
cutter; rub to a paste with back of 
spoon, moistening with cream; season 
slightly with salt and add a tablespoon 
of maple syrup or maple sugar finely 
scraped, to a cup of nut meats. 

This is delicious spread upon thin 
slices of bread and made into sand- 
wiches. A lettuce leaf may also be 
laid in each sandwich. 



xvra 

Pastry 



Materials for pastry should be fresh 
and sweet, and preferably very cold. 
Butter, lard, milk, water, or cream, and 
even the flour, should have been in the 
ice chest or in a cool place until well 
chilled. To prevent the juice of pies 
from soaking into the under crust, beat 



an egg well and with a bit of cloth 
dipped into the egg, brush over the 
under crust before putting in the fill- 
ing. This is especially important for 
fruit pies. Pies should have at first 
a moderate oven, particularly those 
filled with uncooked fruits, with 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



91 



quicker heat to complete baking and 
browning. 

Pie plates need not be greased; good 
shortening serves the purpose. Always 
have filling ready before beginning 
crust, that the latter may be filled and 
baked as quickly as possible. 

271. PIE CRUST WITH LARD. 

1 cup sifted flour. 
54 cup lard. 

J4 cup butter. 

Yz teaspoon salt. 

Yi teaspoon baking powder. 

2 tablespoons milk. 

Sift the flour, salt and baking pow- 
der together; rub the lard and butter 
into the flour, until dry and crumbly. 
This should be evenly and carefully 
done, using the finger tips. Moisten 
with 2 tablespoons of milk or just 
barely enough to make the ingredients 
cling together enough to roll. The se- 
cret of getting fluffy pie crust is to 
use little moistening. It may seem to 
be hardly moist enough to cling; but 
press it well together (never knead), 
divide the dough, taking only enough 
for under crust, flour the rolling pin 
slightly and roll into a round shape as 
thin as possible. Fit the crust upon 
the plate, lifting it carefully and pat- 
ting with the other hand to see that 
no air bubbles are left under it. Hold 
the plate upon the left hand, and with 
a knife, cut the crust off with the 
plate edge as a guide. This quantity 
makes a two-crust pie. 

For a one-crust pie, only a table- 
spoon of butter and a tablespoon of 
lard should be enough. Pinch up the 
crust and crimp the edge to prevent 
filling from running over. In filling 
a one-crust pie, do not allow the liquid 
to come quite to the top of the plate. 

For a two-crust pie, roll remaining 
dough to 54 inch thickness, spread 
thinly with butter which has been 
washed in very cold water and the 
water carefully squeezed out. Fold the 
crust twice, then twice the other way, 
into a small square pat; roll again and 
spread with butter and fold as before; 
repeat this several times for a nice puff 
paste. 

Then quickly fill the pie, fold up- 
per crust through the center and cut 
three small diagonal slits on the edge 
of the fold for escaping steam; moisten 
edge of lower crust with water; lay 
crust across half of the pie, open out 



the crust over other half and trim off, 
not too close; turn edge of upper 
crust under edge of lower crust, press 
down evenly with the thumb, then 
using a four-tined fork and allowing 
fork to rest on edge of crust about 
half an inch (tines pointing toward 
the center) press down, quickly and 
firmly. Repeat all around the pie. This 
pinches crusts together and ornaments 
the pie. Dot top of crust with bits 
of butter, dredge lightly with flour, 
pour cold water quickly on and off, 
and bake immediately. 

212. LARD PIE CRUST WITH 
WATER. 

1 cup flour. 
54 cup butter. 
54 cup lard. 

54 teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons water. 

Proceed as for pie crust No. 271. 

273. PIE CRUST WITHOUT LARD. 

1 54 cups flour. 

54 cup butter. 

54 teaspoon salt. 

J4 teaspoon baking powder. 

4 tablespoons of rich cream (a trifle 
more if needed). 

Proceed as for pie crust No. 271, 
using the cream for moistening. If 
dough will not cling together with 4 
tablespoons of cream, add a trifle more. 
This is wholesome and very nice. 

274. PUFF PASTE. 

The directions for upper crust (see 
No. 271) embody the principles of puff 
paste. For a very light puff paste, the 
butter should be washed in a bowl 
which has been first rinsed in hot 
water, then chilled in cold. Treat the 
hands in the same manner and but- 
ter will not adhere. Wash the butter 
by letting cold water run over it; 
squeeze out the water with the hands 
and work butter until soft, still al- 
lowing the cold water to run over it. 

Miss Farmer's directions for very 
light paste, suitable for patties, etc., 
continue as follows: 

1 pound butter. 

1 pound pastry flour. 

Cold water. 

Wash the butter, pat and fold until 
no water flies. Reserve 2 tablespoons 
of butter; shape remainder into a cir- 



92 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



cular piece one-half inch thick and put 
on floured board. Work 2 tablespoons 
of butter into flour with finger tips 
of right hand. Moisten to a dough 
with cold water; turn on slightly 
floured board and knead one minute. 
Cover with towel and let stand five 
minutes. 

Pat and roll ^ inch thick, keeping 
paste a little wider than long and 
corners square. Draw into shape with 
fingers. Place butter on center of 
lower half of paste; cover butter by 
folding further half of paste over it; 
press edges firmly together to enclose 
as much air as possible. 

Fold right side of paste over en- 
closed butter, the left side under it^ 
Turn paste half way round, cover and 
let stand 5 minutes; pat and roll % 
inch thick, having paste longer than 
wide, lifting often to prevent paste 
from sticking and dredging board 
slightly with flour when necessary. 
Fold from ends toward center, making 
three layers. Cover and let stand 5 
minutes. Repeat twice,^ turning paste 
half way round each time before roll- 
ing. After fourth rolling, fold from 
ends to center and double, making 
four layers. Put in cold place to 
chill. 

Baking a puflF paste requires care and 
judgment. When thoroughly chilled, 
roll and cut as desired, and bake in a 
hot oven with greatest heat at the 
bottom. While rising, it is often nec- 
essary to decrease the heat by lifting 
covers or opening the check draft. Turn 
paste frequently that it may rise evenly. 
When risen, slip a pan under the 
sheet on which paste is baking to pre- 
vent burning. Puff paste should be 
baked on a tin sheet. Cover with a 
double thickness of brown paper or 
turn a dripping pan upside down, cover 
the bottom with a layer of brown pa- 
per, and bake upon that. 



275. GRAHAM PIE CRUST. 

1^ cups graham flour. 

H teaspoon salt. 

Sweet cream to moisten until dough 
will just barely cling together. 

Have cream and flour very cold. Mix 
quickly, roll and use as other pie crust; 
handle lightly, fill and put into the 
oven as quickly as possible. 

Half graham and half white flour is 
liked better by some. 



276. APPLE PIE. 

Pare, core and slice apples to fill the 
number of pies desired. After lining 
pie plates with crust, lay in slices of 
apples, arranging rows around the 
plate; when bottom is covered with one 
layer, fill center even full with addi- 
tional layers, allowing Y^ cup of sugar 
to each pie. Mix ^ teaspoon of salt 
with the sugar, sprinkle over top of 
apples with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. 
Grate nutmeg over all. Distribute a 
teaspoon of butter in small bits and 
cover with upper crust as directed in 
pie crust No. 271. 

277. DRIED APPLE PIE. 

Home dried apples are best. 

Stew them very soft and mash 
through a colander. While stewing, 
add 2 or 3 small bits of lemon or 
orange peel, previously dried and saved 
for cooking purposes; flavor with a 
little cinnamon and nutmeg; sweeten 
with brown sugar; a beaten egg may 
be added if desired. Fill lower crust 
nearly full and cover as directed in 
pie crust No. 271. 

A one crust dried apple pie is nice 
with 1/2 inch strips laid across the top 
1J4 inches apart, then another row of 
strips laid across at right angles to 
form squares. 

278. BLUEBERRY PIE. 

Brush over lower crust after lining 
the plate, with beaten egg; fill the 
crust nearly even full of blueberries 
which have been carefully washed and 
picked over; mix 1 heaping tablespoon 
of cornstarch or flour and % tea- 
spoon of salt into a half cup of sugar; 
sprinkle this over the berries, cover 
and bake about 45 minutes. 

279. COCOANUT PIE. 

1 pint milk. 

1 cocoanut minced in coarse meat 
cutter or 1 cup of dessicated cocoanut. 

1 cup sugar. 

3 eggs. 

Mix the chopped or dessicated cocoa- 
nut with the beaten egg yolks, and the 
sugar; add the milk; fill the plate even 
full and bake. Beat whites of eggs 
stiff, stir in 3 tablespoons of pulver- 
ized sugar, pour over the pie and bake 
to a light brown. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



93 



280. CRANBERRY PIE. 

1^ cups chopped cranberries. 

^ cup chopped raisins. 

1 cup hot water. 

1 cup sugar. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Mix flour and sugar, pour hot water 
gradually over, stirring smooth. Add 
the fruit coarsely chopped, cook a 
few minutes, partly cool, flavor and 
fill crust arranged for a one crust pie 
in a deep plate. 

281. CURRANT PIE. 

Prepare filling as follows: stem and 
wash currants and allow 1 cup for each 
pie. Beat yolks of 2 eggs with 1 
tablespoon of water and stir in one 
cup sugar which has been mixed with 
% cup of flour; stir in currants and 
fill lower crust. Cover with upper 
crust or bake as a one crust pie, cov- 
ering when done with whites of 2 eggs 
beaten stiff and mixed with 2 table- 
spoons powdered sugar. Return to the 
oven until meringue is lightly browned. 

282. CUSTARD PIE. 

3 cups rich milk. 

3 eggs. 

1 heaping tablespoon flour. 

4 large tablespoons light brown su- 
gar (or part maple is better). 

A pinch of salt. 

1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Heat the milk in double boiler; mix 
sugar and flour, and add to beaten 
eggs, stirring until perfectly smooth; 
add salt, pour the hot milk slowly 
into the mixture while stirring; use 
only as much milk as needed to fill 
plate. Just before pouring into crust, 
add vanilla. Fill crust prepared as di- 
rected in No. 271 for a one crust pie, 
being careful not to fill above the top 
of the plate. If liquid does not come 
to top of plate, add a little more of the 
hot milk, stirring it in without touch- 
ing crust. Bake in a slow oven; it is 
done when a knife cut into the cus- 
tard comes out clean. 

For a richer pie, use 5 eggs and 
omit the flour. 

283. FRUIT PIES. 

Fruit pies made of berries, should 
be treated the same as blueberry pie 
(see No. 278). For peach or apricot 



pie, pare and stone the fruit, cut into 
fourths then into eighths and fill lower 
crust as directed for apple pie; sprinkle 
over with sugar, in which a heaping 
tablespoon of cornstarch has been 
mixed. Cover and bake. 

For fruit pies, upper and lower crust 
may first be baked if desired. Line 
plate for lower crust as usual; spread 
upper crust upon a sheet of tin or the 
bottom of a dripping pan and bake both 
in a moderate oven. Then fill the lower 
crust, prick the upper crust and slip 
it into place on the top of pie. Re- 
turn to the oven until filling is heated 
through. 

284. CREAM BERRY PIE. 

1 Yz cups berries. 

1 cup cream. 

1 cup sugar. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

Mix flour and sugar, stir into ber- 
ries, add cream and bake as a one

juice of the lemon. Moisten flour with 
cold water, stirring until smooth; add 
cup of boiling water gradually and 
cook a few moments in a sauce pan; 
add butter to flour mixture. Beat the 
eggs, add lemon juice and grated rind, 
then add sugar, the flour and butter 
mixtuj-e and the stiffly beaten white. 
When evenly mixed, bake as a one 
crust pie in a deep plate, having the 
edge of crust pinched up around the 
edge to prevent running over. Do not 
fill pie above edge of plate. 

286. MERINGUE. 

Whites of 2 eggs. 

4 tablespoons powdered sugar. 
14 teaspoon cream of tartar. 

Beat the whites until stiff, add cream 
of tartar, stir in the sugar and spread 
upon the top of a freshly baked lemon

ger and nutmeg. 

Stew a small pumpkin which has been 
cut into strips, pared and cut into 2- 
inch squares. Put on to cook in 2 cups 
of water, just enough to cover bottom 
of kettle and furnish steam; add more 
water if necessary. Simmer slowly and 
do not allow to scorch but keep water 
when tender set back, uncover, and 
simmer until water has evaporated; 
mash and stir with spoon and dry out 
the water as much as possible; press 
through a colander; pumpkin is now 
ready to use. 

For each average deep pie, prepare 
filling in the proportions given above. 
Use good sized deep earthen plates; 
pumpkin pies of early days were made 
2 or more inches deep in shallow bak- 
ing pans. Measure pumpkin and stir 
in molasses; beat the egg, add sugar, 
salt, milk or cream and spices. Fill 
the under crust which has been well 
pinched up at the edges, allowing liquid

lows: clean sweet California prunes, 
washing thoroughly in warm water and 
rubbing gdntly between the hands; 
rinse several times. Put into sauce 
pan with water to just cover and allow 
to simmer several hours, keeping the 
dish covered. If water boils away, a 
little more may be added, but at the 
end the juice should be almost en- 
tirely evaporated. When done, rub 
through a colander to remove skins 
and stones. Put into a small baking 
dish and place this in a pan of hot

310. COTTAGE PUDDING. 



J4 cup of butter. 
Yz cup of sugar. 
1 egg. 



1 cup milk. 

2Y\ cups flour. 

4 teaspoons baking powder. 

Yi teaspoon salt. 

Cream the butter, add sugar grad- 
ually and egg well beaten; mix and 
sift flour, baking powder and salt; add 
alternately with milk to first mixture; 
turn into buttered cake pan and bake

311. MOTHER'S PUFF PUDDINGS. 

1 pint flour. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 
1 teaspoon salt. 

]\Iilk to make a soft batter. 

1 pint fresh fruit. 

Sift flour, baking powder and salt 
together; add milk very gradually un- 
til batter will nearly, but not quite 
drop when dipped up on the spoon. 
Have ready a pint of fresh fruit; red 
raspberries, black raspberries, blueber- 
ries or peaches are very nice. Grease 
6 cups thoroughly, drop a tablespoon 
of batter into each, then a heaping 
spoon of fruit and cover with another 
spoon of batter. Cook in a steamer

313. ENGLISH PLUM PUDDING. 

Beat 6 yolks and 4 whites of eggs 
very light and add to them a tumbler 
of sweet milk. Stir in gradually % 
pound grated or chopped stale bread, 
1 pound sifted flour, ^ pound light 
brown sugar, 1 pound of beef suet 
minced in the meat chopper, Yz pound 
currants well washed and dried in a 
napkin, 1 pound stoned raisins well 
floured, J^ pound citron cut very fine, 
14 pound almonds blanched and put 
through coarsest meat cutter, H pound 
candied orange peel and J4 pound pre- 
served Canton ginger both cut fine, and 
14 pound candied cherries; stir well, 
then add 2 grated nutmegs, a table- 
spoon of mace, ^ tablespoon ground 
cinnamon, J4 tablespoon ground clove, 
1 wineglass of brandy, 1 wineglass 
of sherry, a teaspoon salt, and finally 
another tumbler of milk. Fill buttered 
moulds three-fourths full, cover tightly 
and steam five hours. This recipe 
makes two two-quart and two one- 
quart puddings and can be relied upon 
for light, delicious, perfect plum pud- 
dings. Puddings will keep a year if 
tipped from the moulds and, when cool, 
wrapped in a perfectly clean pudding 
cloth or towel and set away in a tin 
box in which is kept standing a tumbler 
containing a wineglass of whiskey. 

One hour before serving, slip a pud- 
ding into the mould in which it was 
originally cooked and steam for one 
hour. If pudding seems dry, leave 
the cover off. To serve plum pudding 
in true English style, tip the hot pud- 
ding upon a heated platter, lay on a 
spray of holly, and pour 2 teaspoons 
of brandy and 1 teaspoon of alcohol, 
mixed, over the pudding. Touch a 
match to the spirits and send immedi- 
ately to the table. The pudding should 
be carried steadily that flame may not 
be extinguished. 

Note: — Brandy and sherry may be 
omitted from the pudding if objec- 
tionable, but plum pudding is never 
complete without them. The long cook- 
ing causes complete evaporation and 
their presence cannot be perceived; but 
the pudding is more digestible and 
much finer in flavor if they are used. 

PUDDINGS WITH CORNSTARCH 
FOUNDATION. 

314. CORNSTARCH PUDDING. 

1 pint sweet milk. 
Whites of 3 eggs. 



2 tablespoons cornstarch. 

3 tablespoons sugar. 
l/i teaspoon salt. 

Put the milk into double boiler or 
into a pail set into a kettle of hot 
water and when milk is boiling hot 
(being in double boiler it will not bub- 
ble) add the sugar, then the starch 
dissolved in a little cold milk, and fin- 
ally the whites of eggs beaten stiff. 
Beat the pudding until mixed, then 
pour into individual dishes, grate on a 
little nutmeg and serve hot. 

315. COLD CORNSTARCH 

PUDDING. 

Prepare as above; pour into indi- 
vidual cups, cool, tip out into saucers 
and serve with cold boiled custard 
around each mould. 

316. CORNSTARCH WITH 

RAISINS. 

Measure 1 pint of rich milk. Rub 
2 tablespoons of cornstarch perfectly 
smooth with a little of the milk and 
heat the remainder to boiling, adding 
to it 1 tablespoon of sugar. Add the 
cornstarch paste and cook until it 
thickens, stirring constantly. Then add 
1/2 cup of raisins which have been 
steamed. This may be served hot with 
sugar and cream, or turned into cups 
to mould, the latter being served with 
boiled custard flavored with lemon or 
orange. — (Mrs. E. E. Kellogg, A. M.) 

317. COCOANUT CORNSTARCH. 

Simmer a cup of grated cocoanut 
in a cup of milk for 20 minutes; strain 
the milk to remove the cocoanut, add- 
ing enough more milk to make a full 
quart. With a small portion of it, rub 
\y2 tablespoons of cornstarch to a 
smooth paste and put the remainder 
in a saucepan over the fire. When 
milk is boiling hot add the cornstarch, 
stirring constantly until it thickens, 
then remove from the fire and cool. 
Then add 2 tablespoons of sugar and 
2 well beaten eggs. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven in a dish set in a pan of 
hot water, until the custard is well 
set.

PUDDINGS WITH CUSTARD 
FOUNDATION. 

318. LEMON PUDDING. 

The juice and grated rind of 1 lemon. 

1 cup sugar, 

2 eggs. 

3 well rounded tablespoons flour. 
A pinch of salt. 

1 pint rich milk. 

Mix the flour and part of the milk 
to a smooth paste. Add the juice and 
rind of lemon, a cup of sugar, yolks 
of 2 eggs well beaten and remainder 
of milk, having rinsed out the egg 
with it. Line a plate with puff paste 
J4 inch thick, pour custard into it and 
bake in a quick oven until done. 
Beat whites of the eggs until stiff, 
add 2 tablespoons powdered sugar, and 
spread over the pudding; return to the 
oven and brown lightly. Serve with 
cold cream. This is a rich, but in- 
expensive pudding. 

319. CUP CUSTARD. 

4 cups scalded milk. 
6 eggs. 

Yz cup sugar (maple if possible). 

J4 teaspoon salt. 

A little nutmeg. 

Beat eggs slightly, add sugar and 
salt, pour in slowly the scalded milk; 
strain into buttered cups or individual 
moulds, set into a pan of hot water. 
Sprinkle with nutmeg and bake in a 
slow oven until firm, which may be 
readily determined by running a silver 
knife through the custard. If knife 
comes out clean, the custard is done. 
During baking, care must be taken that 
water surrounding the mold does not 
reach the boiling point, or the custard 
will whey. Also bear in mind that 
eggs and milk in combination must be 
cooked at a low temperature. If less 
eggs are used, custard is liable to 
crack when turned out upon serving 
dish. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

PUDDINGS WITH CEREAL 

FOUNDATION. 

320. HALF HOUR PUDDING. 

Beat 4 tablespoons of butter to a

quarts of water, with a teaspoon of 
salt; put into small cups and when per- 
fectly cold, place in a dish. Make a 
boiled custard of the yolks of three 
eggs, 1 pint sweet milk, and 1 tea- 
spoon cornstarch. Flavor with lemon. 
When cold, pour over the rice balls 
half an hour before serving. 

324. RICE FRUIT WITH CREAM. 

Cold boiled rice, moulded so it can

Frozen Desserts 



353. 



DIRECTIONS FOR 
FREEZING. 



Frozen desserts are among the easiest 
to prepare. When the mixture has 
been put into the freezer, and the stir- 
ring paddles inserted, cover the freezer, 
set into tub, attach crank, screw into 
place, and give the handle a turn to 
see that everything is well adjusted. 
Pound the ice finely in a piece of can- 
vas, the finer, the better. In winter, 
snow may be used in place of ice. 
Scatter 3 cups of ice around the freezer, 
then a cup of salt, then 3 of ice, then 
one of salt, and so on, packing down 
with hammer handle until freezing mix- 
ture reaches the hole bored for drain- 
ing. (This should be just below top 
of inner can.) Keep salt wiped away 
from top openings. 

Ices and creams are more smooth if 
the handle is turned slowly and the 
turning reversed occasionally. When 
solid particles like fruits, Canton gin- 
ger nuts, brown bread, etc., are pres- 
ent, the freezer should be opened when 
it begins to turn hard, the stirring 
paddles should be lifted, and the con- 
tents thoroughly beaten with a long 
handled spoon, without removing can 
from freezer, to prevent solid particles 
from settling at the bottom. Then 
replace paddles, cover, and turn until 
the handle turns quite hard. Then 
open freezer, and if contents are well 
set, remove tne stirring paddles, scrap- 
ing off adhering portions with a knife, 
press down contents of freezer, cover 
plug hole in cover with paper or cork; 
hold inner can carefully to prevent 
liquid from getting inside. Tilt the 
tub a little and allow liquid to drain 
out through the hole in the side. Pack 
with 4 cups of ice to one of salt, pro- 
ceeding as for freezing mixture until 
can is well surrounded; pack down 
well with hammer handle. Cover the 
ice with twisted newspapers, throw a 
thick canvas over all and set aside 
for an hour or more. 

The slower the freezer is turned, the 
smoother and nicer the ice or cream 
will be. Turn slowly from the very 
beginning, except for milk sherbet, 
which needs to have very quick turn- 
ing for a few moments, at first. 



354. MILK SHERBET. 

Dissolve 1 pint of sugar in a quart 
of milk; also soften a tablespoon of 
crystal gelatine in % cup of cold 
water and dissolve by half filling the 
cup with boiling water; have freezer 
ready and put in milk and sugar mix- 
ture, then the dissolved gelatine; add 
the juice of 3 large or 4 small lemons, 
cover the freezer and turn very quickly 
so as not to curdle the milk. 

Milk sherbet may be varied by using 
2 lemons and a cup of raspberries or 
strawberries mashed with a little sugar. 



355. CANTON SHERBET. 
t 

4 cups water. 

1 cup sugar. 

Ys cup Canton ginger. 

y2 cup orange juice. 

Yi cup lemon juice. 

Chop ginger with coarsest meat cut- 
ter; add water and sugar and boil 15 
minutes; add strained fruit juice, cool 
and freeze. 

This is especially refreshing and 
palatable. 



356. LEMON ICE. 

4 cups water. 

2 cups sugar. 

^ cup lemon juice. 

Make a syrup by boiling water and 
sugar 20 minutes; add lemon juice; 
cool, strain and freeze. — (Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 



357. RASPBERRY ICE. 

4 cups water. 

lYs cups sugar. 

2 cups raspberry juice. 

2 tablespoons lemon juice. 

Make a syrup as for lemon ice; cool, 
add raspberry juice prepared by mash- 
ing berries and squeezing through 
cheese cloth; add lemon juice; strain 
and freeze. Currant ice is prepared 
in the same manner as raspberry ice, 
omitting the lemon juice.

358. CHERRY ICE. 

2 quarts sour cherries. 

1 Yi cups sugar. 
4 cups water. 
Juice of 1 lemon. 

J4 cup raspberry or currant juice. 

Pick cherries from stems, wash and 
put into a porcelain or aluminum kettle; 
crush with potato masher, add sugar 
and water and boil 15 minutes. Re- 
move from fire, strain through coarse 
strainer, pressing part of the pulp 
through, discarding skins and stones. 
Cool and add the juice of one lemon 
and a little raspberry or currant juice 
if convenient, though the latter may be 
omitted. Freeze slowly. 

359. VANILLA ICE CREAM. 

(Philadelphia.) 

Sweeten 1 quart of thin cream with 
54 of a cup of sugar; flavor with Xy^ 
tablespoons of vanilla and freeze. 

360. VANILLA ICE CREAM. 

(New York.) 

2 cups scalded milk. 
1 tablespoon flour. 

1 cup sugar. 

1 egg. 

yi teaspoon salt. 

1 quart thin cream. 

2 tablespoons vanilla. 

Mix flour, sugar and salt; add egg 
slightly beaten and milk gradually. 
Cook over hot water 20 minutes, stir- 
ring constantly at first; when cool, 
add cream and flavoring; strain and 
freeze. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

361. CARAMEL ICE CREAM. 

1 quart cream. 

2 cups milk. 
XVi cups sugar. 
1 egg. 



1 tablespoon flour. 

Yz teaspoon salt. 

IH tablespoons vanilla. 

Mix flour, half of the sugar and 
salt, add eggs slightly beaten and milk 
gradually; cook in double boiler for 
20 minutes, stirring constantly at first. 
Should the custard have a curdled ap- 
pearance, it will disappear in freezing. 
Caramelize the second half of the sugar 
by heating the sugar without water, 
in a smooth pan (sugar must be con- 
stantly stirred when it will gradually 
turn to liquid and become a deep 
brown). When sugar is caramelized, 
pour into the hot custard and stir until 
caramel is entirely dissolved. Cool, 
add 1 quart of thin cream, \Yi table- 
spoons vanilla, and freeze. 

362. MAPLE ICE CREAM. 

Maple ice cream may be made like 
vanilla ice cream, using maple sugar 
instead of white sugar, or like caramel 
ice cream, omitting vanilla and using 
IH cups of maple sugar, adding sugar 
directly to the custard, without cara- 
melizing. 

363. BROWN BREAD ICE CREAM. 

3 pints cream. 

1J4 cups grated brown bread crumbs. 

Yi cup sugar. 

Y\ teaspoon salt. 

Soak dried brown bread crumbs 
which have been grated or ground in 
meat chopper, in 1 quart cream; let 
stand 15 minutes, rub through a sieve, 
add sugar, salt and remaining cream; 
then freeze. 

Be sure to open freezer and stir con- 
tents with spoon when partly frozen. 

364. GRAPE NUT ICE CREAM. 

Proceed _ as for brown bread ice 
cream, using Grape Nuts instead of 
brown bread crumbs. 



xxni 

Cake and Gingfcrbread 



Good materials and care are particu- 
larly necessary in cake baking. 

Measure and assemble in good order 
upon the cake board or table all mate- 
rials before beginning to mix. An 



earthen bowl of good size and a strong 
wire whisk or a perforated spoon are 
favorite utensils. There should be two 
measuring cups, one for dry and one 
for moist or liquid ingredients. 



106 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



In making cakes without butter, such 
as sponge cakes, the egg yolks are 
usually beaten until thick, then sugar 
is gradually beaten in and the flour 
is added last. 

In cakes with butter, the butter is 
first creamed with the sugar. Then the 
beaten eggs are added, or yolks only, 
if called for; baking powder is sifted 
with the flour and if separate whites 
are to be added, they are folded in 
just before the flour and the latter is 
then added with as few strokes as pos- 
sible. 

Light cake means long and vigor- 
ous beating. Mix well as each ingre- 
dient is added. Fruit is usually put in 
last. 

Cake pans should always be care- 
fully washed and dried just before 
using, then greased with butter and, 
for cakes containing butter, the pans 
may be lined with waxed paper or light 
weight writing paper, the latter to be 
again slightly greased. A smooth sur- 
face is produced by buttering the tin, 
then dredge with flour and knock out 
all except that which adheres to the 
butter. 

In filling the pan, it should be about 
Ys full; make a depression in the cen- 
ter with back of spoon; this allows 
for rising and usually gives a good flat 
top. 

Cakes should be baked in a moder- 
ately hot oven and should be carefully 
watched; open and close the door soft- 
ly at any time after the cake has been 
in 10 or 15 minutes. After the cake 
is well risen, it can be turned if heat 
is not equal. If a cake cracks open 
upon the top, it is probable that a 
little less flour could be used. Flour 
varies and when it is found that the 
flour that is being used causes cakes 
to crack open, 1 or 2 tablespoons less 
than recipe calls for should be used, 
except in Summer. Summer heat tends 
to make cakes more liquid, which usu- 
ally calls for the full amount of flour — 
possibly a trifle more. 

Sponge cakes when taken from the 
oven may be cooled in the pan if de- 
sired. Van Deusen tins are best and 
being provided with legs at the top 
may be inverted a few moments, which 
allows circulation of air; cake may 
then be removed from the tin (which 
should never be greased) by running 
a knife carefully around ed^es and 
under the bottom, through slits pro- 
vided for the purpose in these tins.

stiff. When whites are partially mixed 
with yolks, remove beater and care- 
fully cut and fold in flour mixed and 
sifted with salt. Bake 1 hour in a 
moderate oven in an Angel Cake pan. 
When failures are made in Sunshine 
and Angel Cake, they are usually 
traced to baking in too slow an oven 
and removing from oven before thor- 
oughly cooked.

ough mixing and stirring and careful 
baking will more than repay the effort. 
Bake from 2^ to 4 hours (according 
to size of loaves) in a moderate oven. 
To preserve moisture, cover with brown 
paper when half done, but bake thor- 
oughly. This makes several loaves of 
ideal fruit cake. To keep perfectly 
moist for a year or more, wrap each 
loaf in cheese cloth, then in a perfectly 
fresh napkin and put into a tin cake 
box in which is kept standing a tum- 
bler containing a wineglass of whiskey. 
The latter will in time evaporate and 
should be replenished.

^ cup milk. 
1^ cups flour. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 

Stir the sugar, egg and softened 
butter well together, add the milk, then 
the flour sifted with baking powder. 
Beat until smooth and creamy. Bake 
in 2 layer cake pans. For fillings, 
icings, etc., see Chapter XXIV. 



383. JELLY ROLL. 



3 eggs. 

1 cup sugar. 

Yz teaspoon milk. 

1 teaspoon baking powder. 



J4 teaspoon salt. 

1 cup flour. 

1 tablespoon melted butter. 

Beat egg until light, add sugar grad- 
ually, milk, flour mixed and sifted with 
baking powder and salt, then the but- 
ter. Line the bottom of a dripping 
pan with paper, butter paper and sides 
of pan. Cover bottom of pan with 
mixture and spread evenly. Bake 12 
minutes in a moderate oven. Take 
from oven and turn upon a paper 
sprinkled with powdered sugar. Quickly 
remove paper from bottom of cake, cut 
off a thin strip from sides and ends of 
cake. Spread with jelly or jam which 
has been beaten to a consistency which 
will spread easily and roll. After cake 
has been rolled, roll paper around it 
that it may better keep its shape. The 
work must be done quickly or cake will 
crack in rolling. — (Fannie M. Farmer.)

Powdered sugar to spread. 

Do not beat the egg, but stir in 
sifted powdered sugar until thick 
enough to spread (this may be known 
by taking up a little of mixture on a 
spoon and cutting with a silver knife; 
if it cuts clean and remains apart, it 
is stiff enough). Flavor with Yz tea-

389. NUT FROSTING. 

Prepare as for No. 385 and add J^ 
cup chopped pecans, English walnuts, 
almonds or any nuts desired. 

390. COCOANUT FROSTING. 

Prepare as for No. 385 or No. 393 
and sprinkle chopped or dessicated 
cocoanut upon the top. 

391. WHITE MOUNTAIN CREAM. 

1 cup sugar. 

^ cup boiling water. 

White of 1 egg. 

1 teaspoon vanilla or 5^ tablespoon 
lemon juice. 

Put sugar and water in sauce pan 
and stir to prevent sugar from ad- 
hering to pan; heat gradually to boil- 
ing without stirring until syrup will 
thread when dropped from tip of the 
spoon or tines of silver fork. Pour 
syrup gradually on beaten white of 
egg, beating mixture constantly and 
continue beating until of right con- 
sistency to spread; then add flavoring 
and pour over cake, spreading evenly 
with back of spoon. Crease as 
soon as firm. If not beaten long 
enough, frosting will run; if beaten 
too long, it will not be smooth. Frost- 
ing beaten too long may be improved 
by adding a few drops of lemon juice 
or boiling water. This frosting is soft 
inside and has a glossy surface. If 
frosting is to be ornamented with nuts 
or candied cherries, place them on 
frosting as soon as spread. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 

392. BOILED FROSTING. 

1 cup sugar. 

Yi cup water. 

Whites of 2 eggs. 

1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Yz teaspoon lemon juice. 

Make same as White Mountain 
Cream. This frosting on account of 
the larger quantity of egg, does not 
stiffen as " quickly as White Mountain 
Cream, therefore is more successfully 
made by the inexperienced. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 

393. ORNAMENTAL FROSTING. 

Whites of 3 eggs. 

1 tablespoon lemon juice. 

Sifted powdered sugar to spread. 



Put whites of eggs in a large bowl, 
add 2 tablespoons of sugar, and beat 
three minutes with Van Deusen egg 
beater. Repeat until 1 Y-z cups of sugar 
are used; add lemon juice gradually as 
mixture thickens. Continue adding 
sugar by spoonfuls and beat until frost- 
ing is stiff enough to spread. (See 
test in No. 385.) Spread cake thinly 
with frosting; when this has hardened, 
put on a thicker layer, having mixture 
somewhat stiffer than first coating, and 
then crease for cutting. This frosting 
is used for decorative work and if it 
is to be shaped into fancy designs, add 
to remaining frosting enough more 
sugar to make it keep its shape after 
being forced through pastry bag and 
tube. 

This frosts a very large cake. One- 
third to one-half the quantity will frost 
a small loaf. 

Use this frosting for making crosses 
upon hot cross buns. 



394. MAPLE FROSTING. 

Boil 1 cup of maple syrup or 1 cup 
of maple sugar to which J4 cup of 
boiling water has been added, until a 
heavy thread forms when syrup is 
dipped^ up and dropped from spoon, or 
until it becomes crisp when dropping 
into cold water. When done pour 
slowly upon stiffly beaten white of 1 
egg and spread at once. 



395. VANILLA FILLING. 

\Yi. cups powdered sugar. 

Yi cup cream to spread (rich thick 
cream is best). 

Yi teaspoon vanilla. 

Add sugar to cream gradually, and 
flavor. If not thick enough to spread, 
and stay in place, stir in a little more 
sugar. 



396. RAISIN FILLING. 

Prepare as for No. 395, adding Y2 
cup of chopped raisins. 



Z^l. NUT FILLING. 

Prepare as for No. 395, adding J4

Q)okies and Fancy Cakes 



Sheets of tin, cut to slide into oven 
and rest upon the ridges made for 
grates, will be found a great conven- 
ience, particularly for cookies. 

Two or three sheets are desirable, 
two being in the oven while a third 
is being filled. Any tinner can cut 
them to the size desired. The absence 
of sides of pan greatly facilitates slip- 
ping the cookies off without breaking. 
A dripping pan turned upside down 
will do. 

401. CREAM COOKIES. 

1 egg. 

1 cup white sugar. 

1 cup sour cream. 

1 level teaspoon soda. 

A pinch of salt. 

1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Flour to mix as soft as can be 
handled. 

Beat the egg, add sugar, soda dis- 
solved in sour cream, vanilla and flour, 
adding just enough of the latter to per- 
mit handling. Mix with chilled ingre- 
dients and keep all very cool while 
mixing. The softer these cookies are 
handled, the richer and nicer they will 
be. Pat and roll, but do not knead. 
Shape with cookie cutters, sprinkle tops 
with granulated sugar and if desired, 
lay a blanched almond upon the top 
of each. 

402. GINGER CRISP. 

1 cup butter. 

2y2 cups sugar. 

J^ cup sweet milk. 

3 eggs. 

1 teaspoon soda. 

1 tablespoon ginger. 

Flour to mix stiff (about 7 cups). 



Cream butter and sugar; add beaten 
eggs, soda dissolved in milk, and gin- 
ger. Add as much flour as can be 
stirred in (about 7 cups, or enough to 
make very stiff). 

Keep mixing bowl in a cool place. 
Cut off a piece about the size of a 
large orange. Return remainder to 
bowl, cover and set in a cool place; 
place the portion cut off upon a greased 
tin sheet and roll out about y% inch 
thick; roll a creased rolling pin lightly 
over it if convenient; if not, bake in a 
plain sheet; sprinkle lightly with 
sugar before putting into the oven; 
watch carefully and bake 12 or 15 min- 
utes, or until very slightly browned. 
If edges brown before center, remove 
from the oven, cut 2 inch strips from 
the four sides, cut these into 3 inch 
lengths and stand on edge around sides 
of a pan to cool; return remainder of 
sheet to the oven until done; remove, 
cut into strips and stand on edge in 
pan. Cut another portion from the 
dough, roll, crease, sugar and bake as 
above, and so on. 

This is very dainty and keeps a long 
time. 

403. SOFT MOLASSES COOKIES. 

1 cup molasses. 
1^ teaspoons soda, 

1 cup sour milk. 

Yz cup butter melted. 

2 teaspoons ginger. 
1 teaspoon salt. 
Flour. 

Add soda to molasses and beat thor- 
oughly. Add milk, shortening, ginger, 
salt and flour. Enough flour must be 
used to make mixture of right con- 
sistency to drop easily from spoon.

THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



Allow to stand several hours in a cold 
place, until thoroughly chilled. 

Toss half of the mixture at a time 
upon slightly floured board, roll lightly 
to yi inch thickness. Shape with a 
round cutter, first dipped in flour; 
bake on a buttered tin sheet. — (Fannie 
M. Farmer.) 

404. CENTENNIAL CAKES. 

2 cups light brown sugar. 
2 eggs. 

Yi cup melted butter (or half butter 
and half lard). 

1 cup chopped raisins (or half raisins 
and half currants). 

2 tablespoons sweet milk. 

1 teaspoon each of salt, soda and 
cinnamon. 

H teaspoon ground clove. 

A little nutmeg. 

Flour to make a mixture as soft as 
can be handled for rolling. 

Cover and set aside in mixing bowl 
until thoroughly chilled. Roll part of 
the mixture at a time; shape with 
cookie cutters and bake upon buttered 
tin sheets. These cakes are delicious 
and will keep for weeks. 

405. GINGER SNAPS. 

1 cup molasses. 

Yz cup butter. 

3J4 cups flour. 

y2 teaspoon soda. 

1 tablespoon ginger. 

lYz teaspoons salt. 

Heat molasses to boiling point and 
pour over butter. Add dry ingredients 
mixed and sifted. Chill thoroughly. 

Toss J4 of the mixture on a floured 
board and roll as thinly as possible; 
shape with a small round cutter first 
dipped in flour. Place close together 
on a buttered tin sheet and bake in a 
moderate oven. Gather up the trim- 
mings and roll with another portion of 
dough. During rolling, the bowl con- 
taining mixture must be kept in a cool 
place. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

406. FRUIT PINWHEELS. 

1 pint flour. 

1 tablespoon sugar. 
Yz teaspoon salt. 

2 teaspoons baking powder. 

2 rounding tablespoons butter. 
1 cup of miik (scant). 



1 tablespoon butter. 
54 cup sugar. 

1 cup currants. 
J4 of a nutmeg. 

Sift flour, sugar, salt and baking 
powder together; into this rub the but- 
ter, using finger tips; wet with the 
milk added gradually. Sprinkle board 
with flour and roll dough in oblong 
shape about 8 by 15 inches and Yt 
inch thick. On this, spread the table- 
spoon of soft butter, 54 cup granu- 
lated sugar and a cup of currants which 
have been carefully washed and dried 
in a napkin. Grate over the nutmeg 
and roll like Jelly Roll with the long 
edge for the length. With a floured 
knife, cut off slices about 5^ of an 
inch thick, lay on a well buttered tin 
sheet or dripping pan, with space be- 
tween. Bake in a quick oven for 12 
minutes. 

407. NUT DROPS. 

Yz cup butter. 

54 cup light brown sugar. 

H cup molasses. 

2 eggs. 

154 cups flour.

Y2 cup preserved Canton ginger cut 
into J^ inch cubes. 

Nut meats for top. 

Cream butter and sugar; add mo- 
lasses, beaten egg, then flour. Beat 
well, add nuts, coarsely chopped. Deco- 
rate the top of each cake with a half 
pecan meat, and bake in buttered gem 
pans (cast iron are best) until done 
and handsomely browned. 

408. CHOCOLATE COOKIES. 

Ya- pound German sweet chocolate, 
grated. 

1 pound medium light brown sugar. 
4 eggs. 

1 tablespoon melted butter.

2 teaspoons baking powder. 
2Y2 cups flour. 

Beat eggs, stir in sugar, melted but- 
ter, chocolate and cinnamon; then add 
the flour sifted with baking powder. 
The batter should be as stiff as can be 
stirred; if it is not, add a trifle more 
flour. Drop a heaping teaspoon of the 
batter upon a well buttered tin sheet or 
an inverted dripping pan. Bake in a 
moderate oven until crackled, glazed 
and slightly browned.

XXVI 
Bread 



Select a standard brand of flour and 
always use the same, to insure uniform 
results. 

Set bread to rise in a very large bowl 
or deep pan, in a warm room, but not 
upon the stove except perhaps in Win- 
ter, when the bowl might be set upon 
the top of the warming oven; do not 
put bread to rise where there is heat 
enough to cook it. Cover the bowl 
with a clean bread cloth, then with a 
large tin cover to keep out drafts. Be 
careful not to set the bread pan 
where a draft can strike it and if the 
room is cool, a clean blanket should 
be wrapped around and over the dish; 
it is well to keep part of a clean blan- 
ket for this purpose. 

Bread is usually considered a diffi- 
cult thing to make, but it is not. Home 
made bread is far more wholesome 
than the baker's product and good 
bread of her own make should be a 
great satisfaction to the housewife. 
There will be no trouble about bread 
making if a good rule be carefully fol- 
lowed. 

Caution: Never dissolve yeast in 
hot water or put it into a hot mixture 
— always tepid. Heat cooks and kills 
the yeast plant which will not, then, 
expand or cause mixture to rise. 

Knead thoroughly — and remember 
this is the best of exercises for de- 
veloping a beautiful wrist and arm. 

409. FAVORITE BREAD. 

1 cup scalded milk. 

1 cup boiling water. 

2 tablespoons shortening. 
1 even tablespoon sugar. 
1J4 teaspoons salt. 

1 yeast cake. 

% cup lukewarm water. 

6 cups flour. 

Mix bread at night. Into the mixing 
bowl put shortening, sugar and salt 
(2 tablespoons butter; or 1 tablespoon 
butter and one of lard; or one of 
butter and one of clarified beef drip- 
pings may be used). Upon this pour 
the scalded milk and boiling water and 
allow to stand until lukewarm. Mean- 
while dissolve yeast cake in J4 cup 
of lukewarm water (never hot water). 



When mixture in bowl is lukewarm, 
stir in 2 cups of sifted flour, add the 
dissolved yeast; then stir in 3 more 
cups sifted flour. Set bread to rise 
over night, following directions given 
above. 

In the morning before breakfast, 
cut bread down with a knife, stir in 
another cup of sifted flour — when it 
should be stiff enough to handle; if 
not, add a trifle more flour. Different 
lots of flour will be found to vary in 
moisture, and the amount of flour 
should be regulated to meet require- 
ments. Scatter flour upon the bread 
board, and knead dough for 10 minutes 
at least; it should not stick to the 
hands at the end of this time. If it 
does, knead a little longer, scattering 
on as little flour as needed. Scatter a 
little flour in bread bowl, return dough 
to the dish, cover as before and set 
aside to rise (about 2 hours). When 
doubled in bulk cut down again, tip 
out upon bread board, knead a little, 
cut into loaves, knead each one well 
and lay into a buttered bread tin. This 
amount makes two medium sized loaves 
or one large loaf and a tin of biscuit. 
Double this quantity makes three good 
loaves and a tin of biscuit. 

In shaping loaves, try to keep them 
free from creases; dough should fill 
the pan about one-third. Have ready 
a little melted butter and brush over 
tops and sides of loaves; prick each 
loaf several times in uniform design 
with a fork. Set in a warm place to 
rise slowly; about 30 to 45 minutes. 
When risen a little more than twice 
their size, set into a moderate oven. 
Bread should not bake too quickly at 
first, that it may rise sufficiently. When 
bread has been in 15 minutes, heat 
should be increased. Bake 45 or SO 
minutes. When done, bread should tip 
out easily, having shrunk slightly from 
sides of pan. 

After removing from oven, spread a 
clean bread cloth upon the table, tip 
out the loaves, set a bread tin upside 
down upon the cloth, and tip loaves 
one against each side of the tin, the 
loaves resting upon edge on the table. 
This permits air to circulate all 
around them, giving a crisp crust. 



114 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



When cool, set into bread box which 
has been freshly washed, aired and 
lined with a piece of fresh paper, pre- 
ferably waxed or paraffine paper. 

410. ONCE-RAISED BREAD. 

Make bread as above, but add the 
6 cups of flour when stirring up the 
bread and knead for 10 minutes at the 
time of mixing. Then raise until fully 
doubled in bulk, cut down, knead for 
five minutes, put into tins, raise and 
bake. Bread made in this way can be 
mixed either at night and baked di- 
rectly after breakfast, or it can be 
mixed early in the morning and baked 
before lunch time. 

411. WATER BREAD. 

1 tablespoon sugar. 

2 cups boiling water. 

14 yeast cake or Ya cup liquid yeast. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

6 cups flour. 

Dissolve sugar in boiling water and 
allow to cool until lukewarm. Add 
yeast (dissolved in a little lukewarm 
water, if compressed yeast be used). 
Stir in 4 to 5 cups flour. Stir well 
for 5 minutes, cover bread bowl, wrap 
in a blanket if room is cold, and allow 
to rise over night. In the morning 
add balance of flour and a little more 
if necessary, also the salt. Knead well 
for IS or 20 minutes, cover and allow 
to rise again. When doubled in bulk 
shape into loaves as directed for Fa- 
vorite Bread. Brush over with butter, 
prick, allow to rise in the tins and 
bake. 



412. 



WATER BREAD WITH 
SHORTENING. 



1 tablespoon sugar. 

1^ teaspoons salt. 

1 tablespoon butter. 

1 tablespoon lard or clarified beef 
drippings. 

1 pint boiling water. 

J^ of a yeast cake dissolved in 3 
tablespoons lukewarm water. 

6 cups flour (sifted). 

Pour boiling water upon shortening, 
sugar and salt in mixing bowl; allow 
to cool until lukewarm, then add yeast 
which has been dissolved in 3 table- 
spoons lukewarm water. Add 6 cups 
of sifted flour, stir thoroughly for 10 



minutes and when well mixed, scatter 
a little flour on bread board, tip out 
and knead for 10 minutes, or until 
bread does not stick and bubbles break 
in the dough. Bread when thoroughly 
kneaded should be elastic and tender. 
Scatter a little flour in bread bowl, 
cover with bread cloth and a tin kettle 
cover, and allow to rise over night. 
In the morning before breakfast, knead 
bread again for 10 minutes. Allow to 
rise a second time if desired, or bread 
may be at once shaped into loaves and 
put into tins. When shaped into loaves, 
brush over with butter, prick and when 
doubled in bulk, bake in a moderate 
oven, increasing the heat when half 
done. 

413. WHOLE WHEAT BREAD. 

2 cups warm water. 

1 teaspoon sugar. 

4 even cups whole wheat flour. 

2^ cups white flour (even measure). 

Yz compressed yeast cake dissolved 
in a little tepid water. 

Pour warm water into bread bowl, 
add yeast and sugar, beat in the white 
flour, cover well, wrapping in a blanket 
if room is cool and allow to rise until 
foamy. Then stir well, add 1 tea- 
spoon salt, and whole wheat flour, which 
has been slightly warmed in the oven. 
The dough should be very stiff. Knead 
thoroughly for 15 to 20 minutes, re- 
turn to bread bowl which has been 
washed and buttered. When doubled 
in size, shape into 2 loaves, place in 
oblong bread tins and allow to rise 
until very light. Bake in a very hot 
oven for 10 or 15 minutes, then mod- 
erate the heat and bake from 45 min- 
utes to an hour and a quarter, accord- 
ing to heat of oven. 

414. NUT BREAD. 

Make as for Whole Wheat Bread, 
working in a cup of chopped nut meats 
when adding the whole wheat flour. 
English walnuts, hickory nuts, or but- 
ternuts are best. 

415. RYE BREAD. 

Make the same as Water Bread. In 
the morning when well risen, add a 
second tablespoon of sugar and a cup 
of rye flour instead of the sixth cup 
of wheat flour. If more flour is neces- 
sary for kneading, use rye instead of 
wheat, but do not use more than is re-

115 



quired to make the dough just stiff 
enough to handle without sticking. 
Knead 10 or 15 minutes or until bub- 
bles break in the dough and it is elastic 
and tender. White flour should be 
used for the bread board. Rye bread 
should not be quite so stiff as wheat 
bread, and may need to bake a little 
longer. 

416. GRAHAM BREAD. 

1 cup scalded milk. 
1^ cups boiling water. 
Yi cup molasses. 

lYz teaspoons salt. 

^ yeast cake dissolved in 2 table- 
spoons lukewarm water. 

3 cups wheat flour. 

3 cups graham flour. 

Pour scalded milk and boiling water 
upon molasses and salt in bread mixer. 
Dissolve yeast cake in the lukewarm 
water and when bread mixture has 
cooled to lukewarm, stir in 2 cups of 
wheat flour, then the dissolved yeast, 
add the third cup of wheat flour and 
stir in the 3 cups of graham, after sift- 
ing. Part of the bran remains in sifter 
and should not be used. Cover well 
and allow to rise until doubled in bulk. 
Stir again, beating for 10 minutes. 
Half iill well buttered bread pans and 
allow to rise until nearly doubled in 
bulk. Bake in a slow oven for 2 or 
2J4 hours. 

417. QUICK GRAHAM BREAD. 

lYz pints sour milk. 

Yt cup New Orleans molasses. 

Y2 teaspoon salt. 

2 teaspoons soda dissolved in a little 
hot water. 

Graham flour. 

Mix sour milk and molasses, add salt 
and soda dissolved in the hot water. 
Add as much graham flour as can be 
stirred in with a spoon; pour into 
a well greased bread pan, set at once 
into a slow oven and bake two hours. 



418. 



UNLEAVENED GRAHAM 
BREAD. 



3J^ cups graham flour or meal. 

1 cup cold water. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Add flour to cold water and salt, and 
knead for 20 minutes. Shape into a 
loaf, lay into a small well buttered 
bread tin, allow to rise for two hours 



and bake in , a moderate oven for two 
hours. This resembles the German 
pumpernickel and is a very easily di- 
gested bread recommended for dyspep- 
tics. 

419. BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

2 cups cornmeal. 

2 cups rye meal. 

2 cups sour milk. 

1 teaspoon soda. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Yz cup New Orleans molasses. 

1 egg. 

I/2 cup seeded raisins. 

Sift salt with the flour; dissolve soda 
in sour milk and add to the flour; 
add molasses, egg ^ well beaten, and 
the raisins. Pour into well buttered 
brown bread moulds or a tapering 
pail with tight cover. Steam 3 hours 
putting on over cold water and begin 
to time as soon as water boils. When 
done, remove covers from moulds and 
bake H hour. 

420. CORN BREAD WITHOUT 
BUTTER. 

2 rounding cups cornmeal. 

2 cups sour milk or buttermilk. 

1 egg. 

1 teaspoon soda. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

Dissolve soda in sour milk or but- 
termilk, stir into the meal sifted with 
salt; beat until smooth and bake in 
shallow cake tin or gem pans. _ 1 ta- 
blespoon sugar may be added if de- 
sired. 

421. CORN BREAD WITH 
BUTTER. 

1 cup cornmeal. 

1 cup flour. 

Y3 cup sugar. 

1 egg. 

1 cup sour milk. 

Y3 teaspoon soda. 

1 tablespoon butter (or two may be 
used). 

Beat egg and add meal and sour 
milk alternately, then the butter (soft- 
ened), sugar and finally the soda dis- 
solved in a little warm water. Sweet 
milk may be used, but is not as nice; 
in this case use 1 teaspoon baking 
powder sifted with the flour, and omit 
the soda; bake 20 minutes in a hot 
oven, using a cake tin about 2 inches 
deep.

scalded and cooled until tepid; stir in 
the white flour, beating thoroughly; 
raise until foamy, then beat in the 
graham and whole wheat flour (equal 
proportions) sifted together. A little 
more than the amount given may be 
added if necessary for kneading. 
Knead thoroughly for 20 minutes, then 
work in the raisins which have been 
washed, seeded, dried in a napkin and 
dredged with flour. Allow to rise, 
then shape for tins, raise again in the 
pans, and bake. 



423. BUCKWHEAT BREAKFAST

1 tablespoon melted butter. 

IH teaspoons salt. 

Mix and sift flour and salt; dis- 
solve soda in buttermilk, stir into flour, 
add molasses then melted butter. Beat 
thoroughly and pour into a well but- 
tered square tin 2 inches deep. Bake 
in a moderate oven to a golden brown; 
test with broom corn. When done, 
the broom corn will come out smooth. 
Buckwheat calls for buttermilk but if 
this cannot be obtained, sour milk may 
be substituted.

Batters, Rolls, Breakfast Cakes 



424. BATTER FOR EGGING AND 
CRUMBING. 

For each well beaten egg, add 1 or 
2 tablespoons of cold water; roll cro- 
quettes, cutlets or whatever is to be 
crumbed, first in the crumbs, then in 
egg mixture, then in crumbs again. 

425. THIN BATTER. 

The following makes a thin batter, 
useful in many ways such as frying 
German toast, frying tripe, etc.: 

1 egg. 

Yi teaspoon sugar. 

yi teaspoon salt. 

Yt. cup milk. 

Yz cup flour. 

Beat the egg, add sugar, milk and 
flour sifted with the salt. Beat until 
smooth. This makes a little more than 
a cup of batter. If more is desired, 
increase the ingredients, keeping the 
proportions the same. 

426. DUMPLINGS. 

2 cups flour. 

4 teaspoons baking powder. 

Y2 teaspoon salt. 

Y2 tablespoon butter. 

54 cup milk. 



Sift flour, baking powder and salt 
together. Work in butter with finger 
tips and when thoroughly mixed, add 
milk gradually. Beat well and drop 
this thick batter by heaping tablespoon- 
fuls upon potatoes and meat in the 
stew kettle. If liquid comes above 
meat and potatoes, pour off a little, as 
the dumplings should not rest on liquid 
but on meat and potatoes above it. 
Cover kettle and cook six minutes, 
when dumplings should be thoroughly 
steamed and light. Take up dumplings 
on a separate platter. 

427. TEA ROLLS. 

Use a portion of Favorite Bread 
dough (see No. 409). Take off enough 
for a small loaf,, roll long and slender, 
and cut off into 12 portions. Work 
each portion into a round shape in the 
hand, brush over top and sides with 
melted butter and arrange rolls in a 
double crowded row in a well but- 
tered bread tin; prick each roll with 
a fork, and set the tin beside the ice 
or in a very cool place. Cover with a 
thickly folded bread cloth. This should 
be done when bread is shaped for the 
tins in the forenoon. 40 minutes be- 
fore tea time or evening dinner, set 
the tin of rolls in a warm place for 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK.

20 minutes, keeping them covered. Bake 
20 minutes in a moderately hot oven. 
If rolls are not browned on the bot- 
tom and sides when done, tip them out 
and turn them over in the tin and 
allow bottoms to brown lightly. 



428. SHAMROCKS. 

Prepare dough as above, but shape 
round, about the size of a twenty-five 
cent piece of a large marble; brush 
well with melted butter and pack into 
buttered gem-pans, allowing three bis- 
cuits to each gem-pan. When well 
risen, bake 20 minutes in a moderately 
hot oven. The contents of each divi- 
sion will tip out in a dainty roll, which 
will divide into three sections when 
broken at the table. 



429. PARKER HOUSE ROLLS. 

2 quarts flour. 

1 quart milk. 

2 heaping tablespoons butter (or 1 
of butter and 1 of lard or clarified 
beef drippings). 

1 heaping tablespoon sugar. 
1 teaspoon salt. 

1 yeast cake dissolved in J4 cup 
lukewarm water. 

Sift sugar with the flour into bread 
mixer or bowl; melt shortening in 
scalded milk; make a well in center 
of flour and pour the milk at boiling 
point into this well; let it stand until 
lukewarm, add dissolved yeast, stir a 
very little of the flour from sides into 
the liquid and allow to stand until 
morning. 

Mix all thoroughly with a knife, al- 
low to rise, then cut down and allow 
to rise again. About two hours be- 
fore wanted, add a little more flour, 
just enough to permit kneading. Knead 
for 10 minutes, roll out to 54 inch 
thickness; cut out with round biscuit 
cutter; crease across with a wooden 
skewer, pressing down firmly and mak- 
ing one half a little larger than the 
other; brush with melted butter, fold 
smaller half over the larger, press 
lightly into place and lay into shallow, 
buttered tin. Arrange rolls about one 
inch apart, allow to rise in a cool place 
for an hour and a half, then bring 
into warmer temperature for ten min- 
utes and bake 20 minutes in a mod- 
erately hot oven. 



430. SALAD OR DINNER ROLLS. 

2 cups scalded milk. 

J4 cup butter. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

1 yeast cake dissolved in yi cup 
lukewarm water. 

Flour. 

Add butter, sugar and salt to scalded 
milk; when lukewarm, add dissolved 
yeast cake and 3 cups flour. Beat 
thoroughly, cover and let rise ttntil 
light; cut down and add enough flour 
to knead (about 2y2 cups). Let rise 
again, toss on slightly floured board, 
knead, pat and roll out to y^ inch 
thickness. Cut and shape into small 
biscuits, place in rows on floured bread 
board, cover with cloth and pan and 
let rise until light and well puffed. 
Flour handle of wooden spoon and 
make a deep crease across middle of 
each biscuit. Take up and press edges 
together. Place closely in buttered pan, 
cover, let rise and bake 12 to 15 min- 
utes in a hot oven. From this same 
mixture crescents, braids, twists, bow- 
knots and other fancy shapes may be 
made. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

431. BREAKFAST ROLLS. 

1 rounding tablespoon butter. 

2 cups hot milk. 
4 cups flour. 

1 egg- 

34 teaspoon salt. 

1 yeast cake dissolved in J4 cup 
lukewarm water. 

Dissolve the butter in scalded milk; 
when lukewarm stir in the flour, add 
the beaten egg, salt and yeast. Work 
dough until smooth. If winter, set 
in a warm place; if summer, in a cool 
place to rise. Early in the morning 
work the dough, keeping it soft and 
roll out Yz inch thick and cut into 
biscuit; set to rise for 30 minutes. 
They are then ready to bake for 15 
or 20 minutes in a moderately hot

Yi cup butter. 

1 cup medium light brown sugar. 

2 tablespoons flour. 

Stir mashed potatoes into a cup of 
milk in a large earthen bowl. Add yeast 
dissolved in lukewarm water; add salt 
and 2 cups of flour, to make a stiff 
sponge. Beat thoroughly for five min- 
utes, cover with bread cloth and tin 
cover and set in a warm place over 
night (mix just before retiring). Early 
in the morning add one well beaten 
egg, H cup white sugar, the half cup 
of shortening, softened, and 2J^ cups 
of flour or just enough to knead the 
sponge until it no longer sticks to the 
hands and until bubbles break in it. 
Roll the dough to one inch thickness 
and spread in 2 large shallow tins or 
four smaller round ones. Cover lightly 
with bread cloth and set in a warm 
place to rise 30 or 40 minutes. When 
very light, punch holes nearly to the 
bottom, using the floured end of a sil- 
ver knife handle. Use _ J/3 cup of 
butter, cut into 34 inch dice, and put 
a bit in each hole; rub 2 tablespoons 
of flour with a cup of medium light 
brown sugar, until sugar is fine and 
well mixed with the flour. Scatter 
liberally over the buttered and raised 
dough and bake in a moderately quick 
oven 20 minutes. This is the most de- 
licious of Coffee Cake. 

433. HOT CROSS BUNS. 

1 cup scalded milk. 
J4 cup sugar. 

2 tablespoons butter. 
H teaspoon salt. 

J4 yeast cake dissolved in J4 cup 
lukewarm water.

cuits, place in a pan 1 inch apart, 
allow to rise (30 to 45 minutes), brush 
over with beaten egg and bake 20 
minutes; cool and with Ornamental 
Frosting (see No. 393) make a cross 



on the top of each bun. (In making 
cross, either use pastry bag or form a 
piece of strong brown paper into a 
"cornucopia," fasten with a pin, clip 
off the point to leave a small round 
hole, fill with the frosting and press 
through with a spoon, guiding the 
frosting into a cross on the top of 
each bun.) — (Adapted from Fannie M. 
Farmer.) 

434. ENGLISH MUFFINS.

ter melted; beat 3 minutes with Dover 
egg beater and bake 30 to 40 minutes 
in gem-pans, preferably iron, which 
have been heated very hot and then 
well buttered. 

Gem-pans should be hissing hot when 
batter is turned into them. Do not 
open oven door for at least 30 min- 
utes — better not at all. Have oven 
moderately hot.

5 hours and bake in muffin-rings in a 
hot oven for 10 minutes. 

440. GRAHAM MUFFINS. 

Make as for Wheat Muffins, using 
graham flour and adding 2 tablespoons 
of New Orleans molasses. Graham 
muffins should be baked longer and a 
little more slowly. 

441. CORN MUFFINS. 

2 cups sifted Indian meal. 

1 teaspoon butter. 

2 cups milk. 

H teaspoon salt. 

yj oi a yeast cake dissolved in a

120 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



en egg and melted butter quickly and 
bake at once in hot buttered gem-pans, 
for 25 or 30 minutes. 

444. GERMAN TOAST. 

Make a thin batter allowing two 
well beaten eggs to a cup of milk and 
a pinch of salt. Cut stale bread into 
Yz inch slices, dip and tvirn quickly 
in batter, and fry to a golden brown 
in a "piping" hot iron frying pan well 
buttered. Serve on a hot platter, pass- 
ing grape butter or peach marmalade 
with it. 

445. FRENCH TOAST. 

Prepare batter (see No. 425); cut 
bread into Yi inch slices and cut slices 
in two. Dip each piece in the batter 
and fry quickly in deep, hot fat. As 
soon as lightly browned, remove to 
coarse brown paper to absorb fat. 
Dredge with sifted powdered sugar 
and serve on a hot platter. 

446. FRIED MUSH. 

1 cup cornmeal. 

3 cups boiling water. 

Yi teaspoon salt. 

Make a mush as follows: into a kettle 
containing 3 cups briskly boiling salted 
water sprinkle slowly 1 cup of corn- 
meal. Stir constantly to prevent lump- 
ing and cook 5 minutes or until mush 
is quite thick. Pour into a small 
well buttered bread tin. For break- 
fast mush, this should be done the 
evening before. Tip out the brick of 
mush, cut into H inch slices and fry 
in deep fat, or fry in butter in a 
frying pan. Slices should be a hand- 
some golden brown. Serve with ma- 
ple syrup, as the last course for break- 
fast. This makes ten slices. 



447. BUTTER CRACKERS. 

Spread liberally with butter twelve 
square soda crackers or six old fash- 
ioned crackers, split open, allowing ^ 
teaspoon of softened butter to each 
piece spread. If unsalted crackers are 
used, sprinkle lightly with salt. Crack- 
ers which are bought already salted 
will not need more. Lay into a large 
dripping pan and bake to a golden 
brown in a moderately hot oven. Serve 
hot. These are delicious with salad 
or for Sunday Evening Tea. 



448. BUCKWHEAT GRIDDLE 
CAKES. 

1J4 cups buckwheat flour. 

Va, cup white flour. 

Yz teaspoon salt. 

2Y2 cups buttermilk or thick sour 
milk. 

1J4 teaspoons soda. 

1 egg. 

Sift buckwheat flour, white flour and 
salt together. Dissolve soda in butter- 
milk (or sour milk) and add very 
gradually, beating very smooth. Add 
well beaten egg and bake on a hot 
iron griddle greased with salt pork or 
beef drippings. When full of bubbles 
and lightly browned on one side, turn, 
using a broad knife or cake turner. 
These cakes are quite thin and may 
be made as small griddle cakes or if 
made large, may be buttered, sprinkled 
with sugar and rolled over a knife. 
Serve with new maple syrup or a fruit 
marmalade. Use buttermilk in prefer- 
ence to sour milk if convenient. This 
makes twelve or more large or thirty- 
six small cakes. 



449.

sugar together; add milk very grad- 
ually beating smooth. Add well beaten 
egg and melted butter. Cook as di- 
rected for Buckwheat Cakes. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



121 



451. CORN GRIDDLE CAKES. 

1 cup flour. 

% cup cornmeal. 

4 teaspoons baking powder. 

54 teaspoon salt. 

2 tablespoons sugar. 
1 cup boiling water. 
^ cup milk. 

1 egg. 

1 tablespoon melted butter. 

Add salt to boiling water and while 
boiling briskly sprinkle in the corn- 
meal stirring constantly to prevent 
lumping; boil 5 minutes, turn into mix- 
ing bowl, add slowly the milk then the 
white flour, baking powder and sugar 
sifted together; add the well beaten 
egg and melted butter. Cook as direct- 
ed for Buckwheat Cakes. 



452. 



SWEET-CORN GRIDDLE 

CAKES. 



Make a batter as directed for Sour 
Milk Griddle Cakes and add Yz cup of 
cold sweet corn cut from the cob. 
Scrape the cob well to include all sweet 
juices. 

453. IDEAL DOUGHNUTS. 

2 eggs. 

1 cup sugar. 

1 cup sour milk. 

1 even teaspoon soda. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

K teaspoon baking powder. 

1 tablespoon rich sour cream or J^ 
tablespoon butter. 

Yi oi a. nutmeg grated. 

2% cups flour. 

Beat the eggs, add sugar gradually; 
dissolve soda in sour milk and add to 
the mixture; add nutmeg; stir in flour, 
salt, and baking powder sifted together. 
Doughnuts should be handled as soft 
as possible, never knead them. Sprinkle 
bread board with flour, take half of 
the dough and roll ^ inch thickness. 
Cut out with doughnut cutter (a 
round cutter which makes a hole in 
the center). Fry in fat that just 
smokes, but is not hot enough to burn. 
Do not turn doughnuts until they have 
risen well, but do not allow them to 
crack open much as this mars their 
appearance. When well risen on one 
side, turn, brown lightly, turn again 
and when evenly browned, remove to 
coarse brown paper to drain. This 
makes 35 doughnuts. 



454. GRANDMOTHER'S CREAM 
DOUGHNUTS. 

1 cup sour cream. 

1 cup light brown sugar. 

2 eggs. 

1 teaspoon soda. 
54 teaspoon salt. 
ZY2 cups flour. 

Beat the eggs, add sugar gradually, 
then the sour cream in which soda has 
been dissolved. Beat thoroughly and 
stir in flour sifted with salt. Handle 
as soft as possible; roll, cut and fry 
as directed for No. 453. 

455. MOTHER'S PLAIN DOUGH- 
NUTS. 

2 cups flour. 

2 even teaspoons baking powder. 

1 scant teaspoon salt. 

1 teaspoon butter. 

Sweet milk. 

Sift flour, baking powder and salt 
together into mixing bowl. Rub in 
butter with finger tips and stir in 
■milk to make a dough as soft as can 
be handled (about two-thirds of a cup). 
Tip out upon floured board, roll into 
a strip 3 inches wide and J^ inch 
thick. Cut off strips ^ inch wide, roll 
them out long, twist and fry to a light 
brown in deep fat. This makes 18 
doughnuts, and is an excellent recipe 
for doughnuts to be eaten fresh with 
syrup or coff^ee. 



456. 



RAISED DOUGHNUTS 
(PLAIN). 



When making bread, take from the 
bread dough, which has been raised and 
is ready for the tins, enough to fill a 
pint basin; roll to half inch thickness, 
cut into half inch strips 6 inches 
long, twist and fry to a light brown in 
deep fat as for doughnuts. Serve hot 
for breakfast. This makes a dozen 
doughnuts. 

457. CRULLERS. 

Two coffee-cups sugar, one of sweet 
milk, three eggs, a heaping tablespoon 
butter, three teaspoons baking powder 
mixed with six cups flour, half a nut- 
meg, and a level teaspoon cinnamon. 
Beat eggs, sugar and butter together, 
add milk, spices and flour; put another 
cup flour on moulding board, turn the 



122 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



doughy out on it, and, handling lightly, 
work in flour until stiff enough to roll 
out to a quarter inch thick; cut into 
2-inch squares, make three or four 
long incisions in each square, using 
a "cruller wheel," lift by taking alter- 
nate strips between the finger and 
thumb, drop into hot lard, and cook 
like doughnuts. 

458. ROSETTE WAFERS. 

2 eggs. 

1 teaspoon sugar. 

yi teaspoon salt. 

1 cup milk. 

1 cup flour. 



Powdered sugar. 

Beat eggs slightly with sugar and 
salt; add milk, then flour and beat un- 
til smooth. Batter should be quite 
thin. This amount makes 40 rosettes 
for which Swedish rosette irons are 
necessary. These rosettes make very 
nice foundations for patties, individual 
short cakes, creamed vegetables, etc. 
If served as a dessert, they may be 
sprinkled with powdered sugar. They 
keep well in a stone jar and may be 
used as needed in various ways. 

459. SHORT CAKE CRUST. 

2 cups flour. 

1 teaspoon soda. 
54 cup sour milk. 

2 tablespoons sour cream or 1 table- 
spoon melted butter. 

y2 teaspoon salt. 

Sift_ flour and salt together; dissolve 
soda in sour milk, stir gradually into 
flour; add cream or butter. This should 
make a soft dough; if at all "pasty" 
add a little more flour by stirring; do 
not knead. Roll to J^ inch thickness 
and cut out with biscuit cutter. Spread 
on a buttered tin sheet or pan and 
bake in a moderately hot oven IS min- 
utes. Split open the biscuit, arrange 



on individual plates, laying on lower 
half and covering with sweetened ber- 
ries. Then lay on second half turned 
upside down, and cover with the fruit. 
Dust with powdered sugar if desired 
or add a "cap" of whipped cream. 

Or, dough may be shaped into two 
large biscuits to fit round cake tins 
and baked 20 minutes. Put together 
as directed for individual short cakes, 
using one biscuit for the lower half 
and the other for the top. Individual 
short cakes, however, are little trouble 
and more dainty. Strawberries, black- 
berries, blueberries, peaches, bananas, 
oranges, currants, steamed rhubarb or 
other fresh fruits may be used for short 
cakes. 

Or, crust may be made like baking 
powder biscuits, with the addition of 
another tablespoon of butter worked 
into flour (see No. 436). A little more 
butter may also be worked in by spread- 
ing, folding and rolling as for puff 
paste, to make crust extra flaky. 

460. SHORT CAKE FILLINGS. 

Strawberries should be slightly 
crushed and covered with medium 
brown or maple sugar 20 minutes be- 
fore time for serving. Spread fruit 
upon the crust when partially cooled. 

Blackberries, blueberries, peaches and 
currants should be covered with white 
sugar and treated as above. Any ex- 
tra juice may be served in a pitcher as 
a sauce. 

Bananas and oranges may be sliced 
and combined, laying the fruit upon 
the crust and sprinkling with sugar. 
Serve with cream. Or, spread crusts 
with orange and cover with orange 
sauce (see No. 508). 

Steamed rhubarb should be sweetened 
a little with medium light brown su- 
gar and spread between and on top of 
biscuit. Whipped cream is particularly 
nice with rhubarb.

Sandwiches 



461. MEAT SANDWICHES. 

Almost any kind of cold meat is nice 
for sandwiches, either sliced, or 
chopped, seasoned, pressed, and made 
into a loaf to be sliced. Thinly cut 



bread and thinly sliced meat is the 
secret of dainty sandwiches. If for a 
picnic or traveler's luncheon, wrap each 
sandwich (and all other articles of 
food as well), in a bit of waxed paper 
and the lunch will come out fresh and 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



123 



dainty, never "mussy." Tongue, boiled 
ham, cold roast beef or cold veal may 
be seasoned with a bit of French mus- 
tard spread thinly upon the meat. A 
crisp lettuce leaf improves almost any 
sandwich, whether filled with meat, nuts 
or cheese. 

462. FRENCH MUSTARD. 

1 tablespoon ground mustard. 

Yi teaspoon sugar. 

Yz teaspoon vinegar. 

Hot water. 

Stir sugar and mustard together, add 
the vinegar and rub smooth with back 
of a spoon. Add enough more hot 
water to make thin enough for spread- 
ing. The above proportions will be 
found agreeable. The quantity may be 
increased as desired. 

463. PEANUT SANDWICHES. 

Make Peanut Butter (see No. 267). 
Spread thinly cut slices of bread with 
the Peanut Butter, lay crisp lettuce 
leaves between, press the slices together 
and if large, cut into fourths. 

464. PECAN SANDWICHES. 

Use Pecan Nut Butter (see No. 
270). Use crisp lettuce leaves and pre- 
pare as for Peanut Sandwiches. 

465. SARDINE SANDWICHES. 

Remove skin and bones from sar- 
dines, and mash to a paste. Mix with 
an equal quantity of yolks of hard 
boiled eggs, rubbed through a wire 
sieve. Season with salt, cayenne and a 
few drops of lemon juice. Moisten 



with olive oil or melted butter. Spread 
mixture between thin slices of but- 
tered bread. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 



466. 



BROWN BREAD SAND- 
WICHES. 



Butter thinly cut slices of Boston 
Brown Bread; spread with Neufchatel 
or Cottage Cheese, press the slices 
together and if large, cut into fourths. 

467. COTTAGE CHEESE. 

Use freshly soured milk, which has 
become thickened or "curdled." Heat 
gently until the liquid separates from 
the whey, but be careful not to boil it, 
as this hardens the whey and makes 
the cheese tough. When heated, strain 
through double cheese cloth or a nap- 
kin and drain well, squeezing slightly 
but not leaving the curd too dry. Turn 
into a bowl, season with softened but- 
ter, salt, a bit of pepper if liked, and 
a little rich sweet cream. Press into 
a bowl or mould and when cold, tip 
out and slice. 

The above is best for sandwiches. 
If served separately as cheese, some 
like the addition of a little sage, well 
pulverized. 

468. CHEESE SANDWICHES. 

Cut bread very thin, removing the 
crusts; slices may be given a round 
shape with biscuit cutter. Spread one 
slice with a thick layer of grated 
American or Swiss cheese, sprinkle 
with salt and a dash of cayenne, press 
a second slice firmly upon this; pre- 
pare all slices as above and fry to a 
delicate brown in equal parts of hot 
lard and butter. 



XXIX 
Cereals 



Cereals should form a part of the 
daily menu. Hot cereals for breakfast 
are best in winter; in summer they are 
better cold and should be served in 
smaller portions, as they are energy 
producers. Being easily digested, they 
are a desirable summer diet with milk, 
though rice, rolled wheat and the light- 
er varieties with little oat meal should 
be selected for warm weather. The 



heavier or coarser cereals, except in 
moderate portions, are too heating for 
summer. 

469. CORN MEAL MUSH. 

To make a smooth corn meal mush, 
sprinkle the meal from the hand into 
vigorously boiling salted water. Stir 
constantly while gradually adding the 



124 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



meal; when nearly as thick as desired, 
remove to one side of range and allow 
to simmer gently for 20 minutes. 

470. MACARONI. 

Macaroni, spaghetti or vermicelli 
should be first thoroughly washed, then 
boiled in salted boiling water; never 
put them into cold water. Cook 20 or 
30 minutes or until tender; drain and 
rinse with boiling water. Never add 
cold water to this class of cereals while 
cooking. Boiled in the above manner, 
they may be seasoned with butter or 
with butter and tomato sauce and 
served as a vegetable. 



471. MACARONI WITH CHEESE. 

Break macaroni into 1 inch lengths; 
boil as in No. 470. Drain and rinse 
in boiling water. For J4 pound of 
macaroni have ready 2 tablespoons of 
melted butter, 4 ounces grated cheese, 
and a cup of bread or cracker crumbs. 
Butter a baking dish, cover the bot- 
tom with macaroni (or vermicelli), 
sprinkle with crumbs, a little melted 
butter, and about J4 of the grated 
cheese. Sprinkle over a little salt; re- 
peat as before, finishing with the grated 
cheese on top. Brown in a quick oven 
and serve hot in the baking dish. 

472. MACARONI ITALIENNE. 

The true Italian method of cooking 
macaroni, spaghetti or vermicelli is as 
follows: 

Prepare the cereal by boiling in salt- 
ed water as directed in No. 470; make 
a tomato sauce (see No. 165), having 
the latter quite thick and well sea- 
soned and adding an extra piece of 
butter the size of a walnut. Add to 
the sauce 1^ teaspoons of beef ex- 
tract. After draining the macaroni or 
spaghetti, turn into a deep dish, 
sprinkle with grated Swiss or Ameri- 
can cheese, add a portion of the to- 
mato sauce and beef juice mixture (the 
latter should be very hot in order to 
melt the cheese). Then add another 
layer of macaroni or spaghetti, more 
grated cheese and more sauce. Stir 
lightly with a fork so as not to break 
the cereal and continue adding maca- 
roni or spaghetti and the sauce until 
all are well mixed. Keep it hot and 
serve at once with grated cheese on a 
side dish. 



473. OATMEAL. 

Steel cut oat meal is the most de- 
licious, highly flavored form of this 
sustaining cereal. This is also less ex- 
pensive than the prepared varieties. 
Keep the steel cut oatmeal in tightly 
closed glass jars. For breakfast por- 
ridge measure ^ cup of steel cut oat- 
meal, lYi cups water, and an even 
teaspoon of salt, these being correct 
proportions for_ four or five persons. 
Put on the night before, in double 
boiler, and allow to simmer gently dur- 
ing the evening; remove to back of 
the range and allow to stand all night 
upon the back of the stove without 
boiling. In the morning set the double 
boiler forward; be sure there is plenty 
of water in the outer pan and allow 
to cook vigorously for 20 or 30 min^ 
utes. 

474. BOILED RICE. 

In order to boil rice and keep the 
kernels whole, wash a cup of rice thor- 
oughly, until the water is clear; drain 
and add slowly 2^ quarts boiling 
water, to which a tablespoon of salt 
has been added. Be sure the water 
boils well before rice is added. Stir 
lightly with a fork, and allow to boil 
25 or 30 minutes, or until kernels are 
tender and do not taste raw. If water 
boils away, add more boiling water. 
Keep the rice well covered with wa- 
ter. When tender, drain in a coarse 
wire strainer and carefully pour over 
it a quart and a half of boiling water 
to rinse off adhering starch. Return 
rice to the kettle in which it was 
cooked, cover the kettle and allow to 
stand where it will not scorch, until 
rice is well dried off. Kernels will be 
firm and distinct. 

Boiled rice may be served as a vege- 
table either without seasoning, other 
than the salt, or it may be seasoned 
with plenty of melted butter, with to- 
mato sauce, or a meat juice. 

BOILED RICE FOR DESSERT. 

If for dessert,_ add a cup of washed 
raisins to the rice 10 minutes before 
removing from the boiling liquid. In 
stirring in raisins, use a fork and stir 
lightly. 

475. RICE BOILED IN MILK. 

Milk may be used in place of water 
for boiled rice and is especially nice 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



125 



when the rice is to be used as a des- 
sert. If milk be used, cook the rice 
in a double boiler, but be sure that 
it is a large one. For a cup of rice 
use a quart and a half of milk (or 1 
quart milk and 1 pint water) and when 
rice is tender, drain and return to dou- 
ble boiler to dry off. Raisins may be 
added 10 minutes before removing from 
the hot milk. 

476. RICE ITALIENNE. 

Boil rice as in No. 474. When 
rinsed with boiling water, return to 
kettle in which it was cooked and pour 
over it a sauce made of 4 tablespoons 
melted butter, 1 teaspoon beef extract 
and a dash of cayenne. Stir in the 
sauce as lightly as possible, using a 



fork in order not to break the rice. 
Cover and keep hot about 5 minutes, 
then serve. 

477. WHEAT. 

Wheat may be purchased in a va- 
riety of forms, nearly all of which are 
very palatable and nutritious. The old- 
fashioned cracked wheat is less expen- 
sive and quite as nutritious and palat- 
able as any other way of serving. As 
a breakfast cereal for four or five 
persons, allow ^ cup of cracked wheat 
to 2yi cups of water and 1 teaspoon 
of salt. Put into a double boiler the 
night before and cook the same as steel 
cut oatmeal (see No. 473). Cracked 
wheat and steel cut oatmeal cannot be 
cooked too much and are quite as good 
when reheated. 



XXX 



Egfgs 



478. BAKED OR SHIRRED. 



Use small cups or ramekin dishes 
which will bear oven heat and in 
which eggs may be sent to the table. 
Set the dishes in a shallow pan and 
heat in the oven. Into each hot dish, 
drop J4 teaspoon of butter, which 
should at once melt and bubble; break 
one or two fresh eggs into each dish, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and re- 
turn to the oven for 5 minutes. 

When the white is nearly set, the 
egg is done. The heat of the dish 
will complete the cooking by the time 
it reaches the table. A small saucer 
or ramekin plate under each hot dish 
will protect the table. 

479. BOILED EGGS. 

As mentioned in Chapter III, eggs 
being largely albuminous should be 
cooked at a low temperature and should 
not be cooked too hard. If cooked 
hard at all, eggs should be cooked very 
hard (about 20 minutes), when the 
yolks will be "mealy." 

Soft boiled eggs may be dropped into 
boiling water and boiled from 2J^ to 4 
minutes as preferred; they are more 
digestible, however, when dropped into 
boiling water, then removed at once 
to a part of the range where they will 
not boil and allowed to stand from 5 
to 8 minutes. When thus cooked, for 



6 minutes, they are like eggs cooked 
3 minutes in boiling water; 8 minutes 
by this method is equivalent to cook- 
ing four minutes in water which boils 
continually. 

480. FRIED EGGS. 

Eggs may be fried in butter, pork 
or ham fat, or in clarified beef drip- 
pings. They should be fried two at a 
time in frying pan which contains four 
or five tablespoons of fat; break the 
eggs carefully into the pan at one 
side, tip the pan up slightly and pour 
the fat gently over the tops of eggs, 
using a spoon, until the white is nearly 
set, and the yolks covered with a 
white film. Eggs thus fried are best 
and are about like 3 minute boiled 
eggs. 

481. PLAIN OMELET. 

Allow one egg for each person, and 
one extra; separate yolks from whites, 
beat the yolks until thick and lemon 
colored, and the whites until stiff and 
dry, adding i^ teaspoon of salt to each 
four whites, before beating, and a 
little pepper to the yolks; also add to 
the yolks a scant tablespoon of boiling 
hot water for each egg." Mix 15 min- 
utes before serving, adding the stiffly 
beaten whites just before pouring into 
a smoking hot and well buttered cast 



126 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



iron frying pan of good size. Allow 
to cook over moderate heat for about 10 
minutes, covering the pan with a tin 
cover. When omelet is well set and 
firm, tip the pan slightly, loosen the 
omelet with a knife and, with a cake 
turner or broad knife, turn one-half 
over the other. Slip the turner slightly 
under the folded edge, and let it rest 
against side of pan to hold omelet in 
place. Set the pan in the oven for five 
minutes, then serve irnmediately upon 
a hot platter. 

482. FRENCH OMELET. 

4 eggs. 

4 tablespoons milk. 

y^, teaspoon salt. 

y% teaspoon pepper. 

2 tablespoons butter. 

Beat eggs slightly, just enough to 
blend yolks and whites, add the milk 
and seasonings. Put butter in hot 
omelet pan; when melted turn in the 
mixture; as it cooks, prick and pick 
up with a fork, until the whole is of 
a creamy consistency. Place on hot 
part of range that it may brown quickly 
underneath; fold and turn upon a hot 
platter. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

483. JELLY OMELET. 

Currant or grape jelly may be spread 
lightly upon half of a plain or French 
omelet just before folding. 

484. MEAT OMELET. 

Chopped ham, veal, beef or other 
meat, seasoned with pepper and salt 
and a bit of melted butter, may be 
piled lightly at one side of the center 
of a plain or French omelet just before 
folding; or the meat may be beaten 
quickly into the omelet just before 
pouring into the pan. 



485. NUT OMELET. 

Chopped nuts (pecans or peanuts 
preferred) may be used instead^ of 
chopped meat and may be combined 
with jelly if desired, being spread 
lightly upon the omelet just before 
folding. 



486. POACHED EGGS. 

Break fresh eggs carefully into a 
frying pan containing boiling water, 
about one inch deep. When the white 
is set, and the yolk is covered with a 
film, the egg is done. 

Egg poachers which hold the egg in 
place and from which the egg may 
easily be slipped off, are a convenience 
and keep the egg in better form. If 
the egg poacher is not used, remove 
the egg as carefully as possible, using 
a large spoon or a cake turner. 

Serve poached eggs upon individual 
portions of hash or upon well buttered 
toast; sprinkle with pepper, salt and 
add a bit of butter while the egg is 
hot. 



487. SCRAMBLED EGGS. 

For each four eggs, allow a scant 
half cup of milk, J4 teaspoon of salt, 
and a little pepper. Beat eggs 12 or 
15 strokes with a fork, add the milk, 
salt and pepper. Pour into a hot fry- 
ing pan containing a tablespoon of but- 
ter and a tablespoon of clarified beef 
drippings (or two of butter). Stir eggs 
constantly and as soon as thickened, 
they are done. If heated further, they 
will lose their creamy consistency and 
the liquid will separate from them. 

Scrarnbled eggs may be served upon 
toast with bacon and in various ways. 
They are nice with asparagus tips. 



488. CHOCOLATE. 



XXXI 



Beverages 



2 ounces bitter chocolate. 
4 tablespoons sugar. 

1 cup boiling water. 

3 cups milk. 

A few grains of salt or ]4 teaspoon 
vanilla if liked. 

Scald the milk; melt chocolate in a 



small sauce pan held over hot water; 
stir in sugar and add hot water gradu- 
ally, beating smooth. Add a few 
spoons of the hot milk, beat well and 
pour the chocolate mixture into re- 
maining scalded milk. Heat about 5 
minutes while stirring and beating. 
Pour into chocolate pot and serve with 
whipped cream. 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



127 



489. PREPARED COCOA. 

For each cup of milk allow 1 even 
teaspoon of prepared cocoa and lj4 
teaspoons sugar. Scald the milk; mix 
sugar and cocoa and stir to a smooth 
paste with a few spoons of the hot 
milk added gradually; pour the paste 
slowly into remaining milk and allow 
to just come to a boil. 

Yj or Yz water may be used. 

Cocoa may be flavored with a little 
vanilla if desired, and some add a few 
grains of salt. 

For rich cocoa use all milk and a 
rounding or a heaping teaspoon of 
cocoa and 2 teaspoons of sugar for each 
cup of milk. 

490. COCOA SHELLS. 

Cocoa shells and cracked cocoa make 
very wholesome beverages and for daily 
use are more desirable than ground 
cocoa, chocolate or coffee. The shells 
need to be cooked from 2 to 3 hours 
and for breakfast should be partially 
cooked the evening before. Allow 1 
cup of shells to 6 or 8 cups of water 
and boil gently. 

The cracked cocoa needs to be cooked 
nearly as long, allowing Yt cup to 6 
cups of water. Strain and serve in a 
coffee or cocoa pot, and serve with 
milk and sugar. 

491. BOILED COFFEE. 

Coffee should always be purchased 
in small quantities and is best when 
home ground each morning. 

Boiled coffee is best when clarified 
with egg. One egg will clarify coffee 
for two or three persons for three 
mornings. Break a small hole in small 
end of egg and take about H of it. 
Set remaining egg in an upright posi- 
tion in a cool place for the second and 
third morning. Crush the shell and 
use it with the third portion ; or, break 
the egg into a cup, beat slightly and 
add a tablespoon of cold water; use 
this mixture for 3 or 4 mornings. 

Boiled coffee may be made with 
either cold or hot water. 

With Cold Water. — Allow a heaping 
tablespoon of medium ground coffee for 
each cup desired and "one for the pot," 
stir coffee and egg together in coffee 
pot. Add a cup of cold water, stir 
well again, then add ^ cup boiling 
water for each heaping spoon of coffee 
and boil 8 or 10 minutes. Add J4 cup 



cold water, allow to stand 2 minutes 
where it will not boil, and serve im- 
mediately. If poured into another pot, 
be sure to warm the second pot, by 
rinsing with hot water, and be sure 
cups have been in the warming oven. 
Follow directions carefully and be sure 
all utensils are perfectly clean. 

Vienna or "German" coffee is one 
way of serving either boiled or drip 
coffee. For Vienna coffee, fill warmed 
cup nearly Ys full of milk which has 
been scalded to boiling point, then fill 
cup with coffee and cap with a table- 
spoon of stiffly whipped cream. 

492. DRIP COFFEE. 

For Drip or French coffee have the 
coffee pulverized and use a close 
grained, strong cloth strainer. Fit the 
strainer into place; use an even or 
heaping tablespoon of the pulverized 
coffee (according to strength desired) 
for each cup of boiling water; pour 
the water over the coffee and cover, 
following directions, according to the 
style of pot used; as soon as it has 
dripped it is ready to serve. 

493. TEA. 

There is but one way to make tea, 
and each detail should be carefully ob- 
served each and every time. Have 
freshly boiled water; just before the 
water boils, fill the tea pot from the 
kettle; when pot is heated through,, 
pour water from it and, leaving the 
cover off, set it upon the back of the 
stove to dry out; just as the water in 
tea kettle boils, put tea into the pot, 
allowing an even teaspoon of tea for 
each cup of water (or vary as desired). 
Allow to stand in a warm place where 
it will not boil about 5 minutes; when 
thus infused, serve at once. If made 
at the table, cover tea pot with a well 
padded cozy while tea is infused. 

It seems needless to say that both 
tea and coffee pot should be thoroughly 
cleansed, rinsed, dried and aired imme- 
diately after each using. The custom 
of allowing tea or coffee to stand in 
the pot, adding more when more is 
needed, is not only unwholesome but 
poisonous. 

494. ICED COFFEE.' 

Make a strong coffee, dilute with 
cold water as desired and add ice, or 
better, set into the ice box for several 



128 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



hours; serve with cream and sugar, 
or clear with a slice of lemon in each 
glass. 

495. ICED TEA. 

Make strong tea, dilute as desired 
with cold water, chill in ice box, or 
by adding ice, and serve with a ^ 
inch slice of lemon to each glass. 
English Breakfast tea (preferably Mon- 
soon) is best for serving cold. 

496. GINGER PUNCH. 

1 quart cold water. 

1 cup sugar. 

J^ pound preserved Canton ginger. 

Yi cup orange juice. 

Yz cup lemon juice. 

Chop ginger, add to water and sugar, 
and boil 15 minutes; add fruit juice, 
cool, strain and dilute with crushed 
ice. — (Fannie M. Farmer.) 

497. GRAPE JUICE. 

There is nothing more refreshing or 
more wholesome as a cooling summer 
beverage, than unfermented grape juice 
(see No. 553). About J^ of a glass of 
grape juice to ^ of a glass of water 
is the usual strength. 

498. LEMONADE. 

3 large lemons. 

Yi pound loaf sugar. 

1 pint boiling water. 

Cold water about 1 quart. 

Wipe the lemons and rub the loat 
sugar over the rinds to extract the 
lemon "zest." Cut lemons and squeeze 
juice upon the sugar; cut what remains 
of the lemons into slices and pour 
upon them the boiling water; when 
this has cooled, strain it upon the juice 
and sugar and add cold water until of 



the strength desired (about 1 quart 
will probably be correct). Chill and 
serve. 

The juice from preserved blue plums, 
red raspberries, cherries or currants, 
or a little curant jelly, grape juice or 
fruit syrup (see Nos. 553 to 557) gives 
a pleasant variety. 

499. COFFEE LEMONADE. 

Coffee saved from the breakfast pot 
may be strained and used instead of 
water, or with water, in making lemon- 
ade. 

500. RHUBARB PUNCH. 

Pour 1 quart of boiling water upon 
3 cups of rhubarb which has been 
washed, stripped and cut into one inch 
pieces. Allow to stand until cool, then 
crush with potato masher, strain, add 
cold water as desired, the juice of one 
lemon, a little ground ginger and a 
little sugar. Chill and serve. This is 
a very wholesome, refreshing summer 
beverage. 

501. VINEGAR WAIER. 

Three or four tablespoons vinegar to 
a quart of water, Ya teaspoon of ground 
ginger arid 4 tablespoons of sugar, 
chilled, is a pleasant and wholesome 
summer drink. 

502. OATMEAL PUNCH. 

This is a wholesome, nourishing bev- 
erage and may be served cold in sum- 
mer or hot in winter. Use Y\ pound 
of steel cut oatmeal or rolled oats, and 
boil 3 hours in 3 quarts of water; if 
too thick when thoroughly cooked, add 
more water; sweeten with IJ/2 ounces 
light brown sugar. Do not strain, but 
stir before drinking.

503. WAYS OF SERVING. 

Fresh fruits, the larger sliced, some- 
titnes sprinkled with sugar, chilled and 
allowed to stand half an hour before 
serving, are always wholesome desserts. 
Cream, whipped or plain, and a plain 



cake are acceptable additions when 
served for dessert. 

Almost any fruit combines with 
boiled rice or tapioca to make attract- 
ive and palatable desserts, usually 
served with cream (see No. 334).

504. BANANA SALAD. 

Strip the skins from bananas and 

arrange individual salads by laying 

bananas (either whole or cut in halves 

lengthwise) upon lettuce leaves. Drop 

a tablespoon of Mayonnaise or Boiled 
Dressing upon each banana. 



SOS. 



BANANA AND ORANGE 
SALAD. 



Peel and slice oranges; peel bananas, 
cut into halves lengthwise, and divide 
across into fourths. Thoroughly chill 
the fruit; arrange a circle of orange 
slices overlapping each other upon let- 
tuce leaves, arrange the four pieces 
of banana in the center of orange 
slices and add a tablespoon of Mayon- 
naise or Boiled Salad dressing. 

506. APPLE AND NUT SALAD. 

Pare apples and cut into J4 inch 
dice; break pecan nut meats into 
eighths, allowing H cup of meats to a 
cup of apple dice; mix apple and nuts 
and for each cup and a half of the 
mixture allow 2 tablespoons of Mayon- 
naise or Boiled Salad Dressing, stir- 
ring lightly with a fork; arrange in a 
mound upon lettuce leaves, pour a little 
Mayonnaise upon the top and serve 
more, separately. 



507. ORANGE AND PINEAPPLE 
SALAD. 

Use equal parts of seeded oranges, 
cut into small pieces, the white part 
being carefully removed and sliced and 
drained pineapple (if in winter canned 
pineapple may be used). Cover with 
Orange Dressing to which, while still 
hot enough to stiffen it, the well beaten 
white of one egg has been added. When 
thoroughly cold, serve in the halves 
of orange peel with a garnish of green. 
If preferred, one-third sliced banana 
may be used with the orange and pine- 
apple. — (Mrs. E. E. Kellogg, A. M.) 

508. ORANGE DRESSING. 

1 cup orange juice. 

1 tablespoon lemon juice. 

Sugar. 

1 tablespoon cornstarch. 

Heat the juice to boiling and thicken 
with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. 
Sweeten with 1 to 3 tablespoons sugar, 
according to acidity of fruit. If it is 
preferred not to boil the orange juice, 
the cornstarch may be cooked in J^ 
cup of water and while still hot enough 
to mingle well, the orange and lemon 
juice is added. Beat the sauce thor- 
oughly that it may be smooth; other- 
wise it must be strained. Thickening 
may be omitted if preferred.

Cooked Fruits 



509. BAKED APPLES. 

Select apples of uniform size, with- 
out blemishes if possible. Either quite 
tart or "sweet" apples are best for 
baking. Wipe and core, arrange in 
shallow pan, fill centers with light 
brown sugar mixed with a little cinna- 
mon or nutmeg if liked. Pour a very 
little boiling water into bottom of pan 
and bake in a moderate oven until ten- 
der. 

510. APPLES IN SYRUP. 

Make a syrup by boiling equal parts 
of sugar and water, allowing a cup 
of sugar and a cup of water to six 
medium sized apples. Cook syrup 6 or 
7 minutes in a sauce pan large enough 
to allow apples to rest side by side 
on bottom of dish; pare and core apples 



and put at once into the syrup. Cocfk 
until just tender. Have syrup in a 
small sized dish, if possible, that apples 
may be well covered. Use remaining 
syrup as a sauce to pour around the 
fruit. Blanched almonds, cut into 
halves lengthwise, and thrust half way 
into sides of apples are attractive and 
palatable. 

SIL APPLES IN GRAPE JUICE. 

Cook gently 2 cups of grape juice 
and a cup of sugar. When reduced 
one-third, pare and core six medium 
sized apples and cook very slowly in 
the grape juice until just tender. Serve 
apples cold in a glass dish, using syrup 
as a sauce; boil the latter a trifle more 
if not thick enough. Garnish with 
whipped cream if desired.

512. LEMON APPLES. 

Pare and core tart apples of medium 
size; fill centers with ^ cup sugar, 
mixed with the grated yellow rind of a 
lemon. Squeeze juice of the lemon 
over tops of apples and bake until just 
tender. Serve with whipped cream if 
desired. 

513. LEMON APPLE SAUCE. 

_ Pare, core and quarter apples (six or 
eight) and cook in a syrup made of 2 
cups of sugar, 2 cups of water and the 
grated yellow rind of half a lemon. 
Cook syrup 7 or 8 minutes before put- 
ting in the apples. Cook pieces of 
apple a few at a time and skim out as 
soon as tender. Pour syrup over 
apples; cool and serve. 

514. SPICED APPLE SAUCE. 

Pare, core and quarter six or eight 
apples, cover in a sauce pan with a 
cup of light brown sugar, add a tea- 
spoon of ground cinnamon or a few 
small pieces of stick cinnamon and 
cook until apples are soft. Stir, cool 
and serve. 

Six or eight cloves may be added in- 
stead of the cinnamon if preferred. 



coarse wire strainer and while hot, add 
2 cups of sugar. Stir until sugar is 
thoroughly dissolved, reheating slightly 
if necessary, but do not boil again. 
Chill in moulds. 

517. CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Cook 2 cups of cranberries and 2 
cups of boiling water 5 or 6 minutes 
after they begin to boil; add a cup and 
a half of sugar, allow to boil up and 
cool at once; do not boil long. 

518. BAKED PEARS. 

Wipe small, sound pears, or, if large, 
cut into halves and remove core. Cover 
pears with light brown sugar in a shal- 
low pan; add a very small quantity of 
hot water and bake in a moderate oven 
until tender (from 1 to 3 hours). 

519. STEWED PRUNES. 

Wash prunes, and soak several hours 
in cold water to cover. Cook slowly 
in water in which they were soaked, 
adding a tablespoon of sugar for each 
cup of prunes; when tender, add a few 
slices of lemon, cook 15 minutes longer, 
cool and serve, preferably as the first 
course for breakfast. 



515. STEWED APRICOTS. 

Pare_ and quarter apricots and cook 
five minutes in a syrup made as for 
Lemon Apple Sauce, omitting the 
lemon. 

BAKED BANANAS. 
(See Nos. 297 and 298.) 

516. CRANBERRY JELLY. 

Cook one quart of cranberries in one 
cup of boiling water 10 minutes or 
until berries burst; press through a 



520. STEAMED RHUBARB. 

Strip rhubarb and cut into Yz inch 
lengths, put into a wire basket or colan- 
der set into a deep plate and steam 
until rhubarb is tender. Remove rhu- 
barb to a deep bowl, sprinkle over J^ 
cup of light brown sugar, to a quart of 
rhubarb, pour over the juice which has 
dripped into deep plate, cool and serve 
as a sauce, preferably for breakfast.

Canning: and Preserving: 



521. GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

For canning or preserving, use only 
sound fruit which has just barely 
ripened, never over ripe, and not green, 
unless green fruit be called for. 



In paring fruit, use a silver knife; 
dividing and stoning can be done best 
before paring. 

Fruit should be cooked enough to 
destroy germs, but not enough to de- 
stroy the natural fruit flavor or to give 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



131 



a mushy appearance; steaming the fruit 
in jars, and then adding the syrup is 
usually to be preferred. 

Jars, covers and rubbers should be 
thoroughly sterilized. Put jars into a 
large pot or wash boiler containing 
cold water to cover. This should be 
done an hour or more before ready 
to put fruit into jars. When water 
has boiled a few moments, set boiler 
upon back of range and cover. Then 
put on syrup to cook, and jars will be 
thoroughly sterilized when ready for 
use. Ten minutes before needed, put 
covers of jars into a kettle, cover with 
hot water and allow to come to a boil. 
Hold each cover to the light and dis- 
card any that show "pin holes." Jars 
with glass or porcelain lined covers are 
best. 

Dip each rubber into boiling water 
before putting upon the jar. 

When syrup and fruit are ready, 
have a large deep pan (bread or dish 
pan) conveniently placed; have ready 
plenty of clean linen cloths; when a 
jar is to be filled, remove from the 
boiling hot water, using a long handled 
knife or a clean stick, dip a cloth into 
the boiling water and drop into bottom 
of pan; dip another in the boiling water 
and wrap around the hot jar which has 
been set upon the first hot cloth; see 
that the cloth covers jar entirely; use 
a wide mouthed funnel and pour syrup 
or fruit and syrup through funnel into 
center of jar; use a long silver knife 
for pressing fruit away from the sides 
of jar to allow escape of air bubbles; 
see that jar is filled full; wipe seeds 
or fruit from outside of top; dip rubber 
in hot water, slip it into place and 
screw on quickly the sterilized cover. Set 
jars where no draft of air can strike 
them. When cool, tighten the covers 
and turn jars upside down. After sev- 
eral hours, tighten covers again if not 
perfectly tight, and dip tops of jars 
in melted paraffine, covering well the 
rubbers and edges of covers. This 
often prevents entrance of air resulting 
from imperfect covers or subsequent 
pin holes. 

If above precautions are taken, most 
fruit will keep almost indefinitely. 
Canned fruit should be kept in a dark 
closet where the temperature is mod- 
erately cool and as even as possible. 

522. TO STEAM FRUIT. 

Steaming fruit in the cans and then 
adding syrup, if thoroughly done, de- 



stroys germs efficiently, keeps the fruit 
tender and preserves natural flavors 
and is therefore preferred by many. 
The fruit is quite as easily handled in 
this way as in any other. 

To steam the fruit, berries should 
be carefully picked over and should be 
firm and just ripe; peaches should be 
cut in halves, stoned and pared, filling 
the sterilized jars as fast as the fruit 
is prepared to prevent action of air 
upon it; cherries may be pitted, also 
plums. The stones of cherries, peaches, 
etc., should be cooked in the syrup, then 
skimmed out to add piquancy to the 
flavor. 

Fill the sterilized jars with fruit, 
shaking down well and packing as full 
as possible without crushing; screw 
on covers lightly to keep out water, 
but do not screw tight or put on rub- 
bers; set jars into wash boiler or 
large pots, having a grate, inverted 
plates, sticks or some protection in the 
bottom to prevent jars from breaking; 
leave an inch between jars (small blocks 
of wood placed between the jars is a 
help as they may then be packed firmly, 
yet without any pressure). Fill boiler 
or pot with warm water (not hot) 
nearly to tops of jars. Allow water 
to come to a boil and cook for ten 
minutes or until fruit is certainly well 
heated through at the boiling tempera- 
ture. Then remove jars from water, 
set into pan upon a hot cloth, wrap 
a hot cloth around the jar, remove 
cover, fill the jar with syrup prepared 
as directed for each fruit; press fruit 
away from sides with silver knife to 
allow air bubbles to escape; see that 
jar is filled heaping full. Dip rubber 
in boiling water, slip into place and 
screw on sterilized cover. Wipe and 
set aside, away from drafts. 

523. SYRUP FOR CANNING. 

A syrup _ suitable for canning nearly 
any fruit is made as follows: — Weigh 
the fruit before cooking; take sugar 
to equal one-third the weight of the 
fruit, put into a large porcelain or 
porcelain lined kettle, allowing 2 or 
2H cups of hot water to each pound 
of sugar, according to amount of fruit 
juice. Stir slightly to start dissolving 
of sugar and cook ten minutes after 
the syrup boils. It is then ready for 
use, either for pouring into jars filled 
with steamed fruit, or for receiving 
fruit which is to be cooked in it, if 
the latter method is to be followed. 



132 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



524. COOKING IN SYRUP. 

If preferred to cook fruit in the 
syrup rather than to steam in the jars 
as described in No. 522, cook the fruit 
15 minutes in the syrup. Do not cook 
all the fruit at once, but put in only 
two or three quarts at a time. When 
cooked, take a sterilized jar and wrap 
in a hot cloth as described in No. 521; 
dip up fruit with a porcelain dipper, 
taking as little juice as possible; pour 
through wide mouthed funnel into jar 
and proceed until jar is full of fruit; 
use silver knife and press fruit back 
from side of jar to let out air bubbles; 
see that jar is made heaping full, by 
adding a little more syrup; wipe away 
any seeds or bits of fruit from outside 
of top, slip sterilized rubber into place, 
quickly screw on cover, wipe jar and 
set aside away from drafts. 

Quinces, pears or any hard fruit may 
be partly cooked in boiling water be- 
fore cooking in the syrup if desired. 
Pineapple, however, should be cooked 
only in the syrup, 15 or 20 minutes be- 
ing sufficient if the pineapple is just 
ripe. Previous cooking in boiling water 
causes too much loss of juice and 
flavor. 

In canning cherries or peaches by 
this method, put the stones into sugar 
and water while syrup is cooking. Skim 
out the stones before adding fruit. 

Berries need only to be thoroughly 
heated through (8 or 10 minutes); 
handle and cook as carefully as pos- 
sible to prevent crushing. 

It is better to overcook than under- 
cook so far as keeping is concerned; 
the only danger in overcooking is that 
fruit becomes too much broken for 
good appearance. 



of berries. Be sure to shake down 
well and have jar heaping full. Put on 
rubbers and covers (not screwed tight), 
set into boiler, and steam as directed 
in No. 522. Cook after water boils 
until sugar has dissolved and juice is 
drawn out enough to form a syrup. 
Remove from kettle, screw covers on 
tight without uncovering, wipe jars and 
turn upside down to cool. When 
cooled, be sure covers are tight and 
dip tops of jars into a dish of melted 
paraffine. Be sure to dip beyond edges 
of covers and rubbers. 



527. CANNED BLACKBERRIES. 

Follow directions as given for blue- 
berries in Nos. 525 or 526. 

528. CANNED RASPBERRIES. 

For either red or black raspberries 
follow directions in Nos. 525 or 526, or 
pick over berries, weigh, make a syrup, 
cook and can as directed in No. 524. 

529. CANNED GOOSEBERRIES. 

Gooseberries may be canned like 
blueberries, see Nos. 525 and 526. Al- 
low a cup of sugar to each quart of 
gooseberries. 

530. CANNED CHERRIES. 

The large white or dark cherries may 
be used but large "sour" cherries have 
the best flavor. Stem the cherries, 
wash by holding in colander under 
running water, and can as directed in 
No. 524. If cherries are pitted, cook 
stones with the syrup, then skim out 
before adding fruit. 



525. CANNED BLUEBERRIES. 

Carefully pick over berries and wash 
by holding in a colander under running 
water. Fill sterilized jars and steam as 
directed in No. 522. Shake down and 
have jars as full as possible. Cook 10 
minutes after water boils, then fill with 
syrup as directed in No. 521. 



526. 



CANNED BLUEBERRIES 
WITHOUT SYRUP. 



Fill sterilized jars with blueberries 
and while filling, sprinkle in sugar, 
allowing J^ cup of sugar to each quart 



531. CANNED PEACHES. 

Cut in halves, remove stones, pare 
and weigh. Follow directions as in 
Nos, 521 or 524. 

532, CANNED PEARS. 

Select pears which are just ripe, but 
perfectly sound, not soft. Using a 
silver knife, cut into fourths, core and 
pare, then weigh and cover with cold 
water to prevent discoloration while 
filling jars. Cook in syrup as directed 
in No. 524, handling fruit as carefully 
as possible. Cook until pears look clear 
and are tender, dip out fruit and fill 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



133 



sterilized jars, first putting in a very 
little syrup, then packing jars with the 
fruit; when no more fruit can be 
added, fill the jar to overflo\ving with 
syrup. Cover, cool, etc., as directed in 
No. 521. If pears are of a hard va- 
riety, they should be first steamed until 
nearly tender before putting into the 
hot syrup. If pears are very sweet or 
not very highly flavored, add the juice 
of half a lemon to each quart of syrup. 

533. CANNED PINEAPPLE. 

Select pineapples at the height of 
their season, having them just ripe. 
Pare and remove "eyes," cut into ^ 
inch slices, then into Yz inch dice; 
weigh, make a syrup and can as di- 
rected in No. 524. 



534. CANNED RHUBARB. 

Have the rhubarb freshly gathered. 
Strip off outer skin and cut into 1 inch 
lengths; fill perfectly clean glass jars 
with the cut rhubarb, shaking down 
and packing well; set the jars one by 
one into a stream of running water, 
allowing the water to run into each jar 
for 20 minutes; do not have force of 
water too great as that causes bubbles. 
At the end of 20 minutes, slip in knife 
and drive out bubbles; see that jar 
is filled to overflowing with water, put 
on a new rubber, screw on a perfectly 
clean cover, seal by dipping into melted 
parafiine. Rhubarb thus canned keeps 
the garden flavor and may be used all 
winter the same as fresh rhubarb. 



535. CANNED TOMATOES. 

Freshly gathered tomatoes just ripe 
but not at all soft, should be selected 
for canning. Skin the tomatoes by 
pouring over boiling water and drop 
into cold water for a few moments 
when skins are removed. Cut tomatoes 
into fourths and allow to stand 20 or 
30 minutes in a porcelain kettle until 
a large portion of the juice has drained 
off. Then pack carefully in perfect, 
thoroughly cleansed glass jars. Allow 
to stand another half hour, tip up 
jars and drain out as much juice as 
possible, adding a few more pieces of 
drained tomatoes to fill the jars. Screw 
tops in place, omitting rubbers, and 
pack the jars into a large pot or boiler 
with racks underneath. Do not allow 
the jars to touch each other; small 



blocks of wood between will be con- 
venient. Fill boiler nearly to tops of 
jars with cold water, heat and allow 
to boil for two hours; remove jars from 
boiler, take off covers, put on rubbers 
which have been dipped in boiling 
water, replace covers immediately and 
screw tight. Cool, tignten covers again 
and seal with parafiine. 

536. DAMSON PLUMS. 

Select sound, ripe Damsons, wash, 
drain and weigh. Allow ^ pound of 
sugar to each pound of plums and make 
a syrup by bringing sugar to a boll 
with water, allowing a cup of water 
to each pound of sugar. Divide the 
syrup in two kettles, keeping one back 
a little. When syrup boils, skim and 
add part of the plums which have been 
pricked twice with a steel fork. Cook 
until plums are tender, pack sterilized 
jars nearly full of fruit, fill to over- 
flowing with the syrup, put rubbers in 
place, cover, cool and seal as directed 
in No. 52L Continue cooking plums a 
few at a time, bringing forward the 
second kettle of syrup when needed. 
(Any extra syrup may be canned the 
same as fruit and kept for lemonade, 
fruit sauces, etc.) 



537. 



PRESERVED STRAW- 
BERRIES. 



Select rich berries which are just 
ripe ad sound; do not use imperfect 
fruit. Hull and wash the berries, 
weigh and fill sterilized jars. Have 
ready a syrup made by allowing Y^ 
pound of sugar to each pound of ber- 
ries and a cup of water to each pound 
of sugar. When syrup has boiled 15 
minutes, skim and pour over fruit in 
the jars, until jars are brimming full. 
Allow to stand uncovered for 15 min- 
utes. Then add more berries, fill jars 
as full as possible as the fruit shrinks 
when syrup is added. Having added 
more fruit until jars are overflowing, 
put in place rubbers which have been 
dipped in boiling water, screw on steril- 
ized covers and arrange jars of fruit in 
a large pot or boiler with racks or 
plates under the jars. Fill boiler to 
tops of jars with cold water, and allow 
to heat until nearly boiling hot. Keep 
just below boiling point for an hour, 
remove jars, wipe, set aside where no 
draft can strike them. When cool, 
tighten covers and seal with parafiine. 



134 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



538. TOMATO PRESERVE. 

For each pound of yellow pear to- 
matoes, allow one pound of sugar, 2 
ounces preserved Canton ginger and 2 
small lemons (or one large). Skin 
tomatoes by pouring on hot water, cover 
with sugar in an earthen or porcelain 
bowl and allow to stand over night. 
In the morning pour off syrup, remove 
tomatoes to another dish, scrape out 
sugar which has settled at the bottom, 
adding to syrup. Boil syrup until quite 
thick, skim, add tomatoes, ginger and 
lemons which have been wiped and cut 
into ys inch half slices (remove seeds 
from lemons). Cook all until toma- 
toes look somewhat clear, then fill 
sterilized jars, put in place rubbers 
dipped in hot water, screw on sterilized 
covers; cool, tighten covers and seal 
with paraffine. 

539. CITRON PRESERVES. 

Pare off rinds, seed, cut into thin 
slices 2 inches long, weigh, and put 
into preserving kettle with water to 
cover. Boil one hour, take out the 
melon and to the water in kettle add 
as much sugar as there is melon by 
weight; boil until quite thick, replace 
melon, add lemons sliced and seeded, 
allowing 2 for each pound of fruit; 
boil 20 minutes, skim out fruit and con- 



tinue boiling syrup until it is quite 
thick; have fruit packed into sterilized 
jars, pour the syrup over it, cover and 
seal. 

540. PRESERVED WATER MELON 
RIND. 

Trim away red center, wash, cut and 
prepare water melon rind as directed 
for Preserved Citron. 

541. BARBERRY PRESERVES. 

One pound sugar and 1 cup water to 
each pound of barberries which have 
been stemmed and washed. Cook untl 
syrup is quite thick (about 2 hours) 
and seal in sterilized jars as directed 
for canned fruits. Very nice with 
meats. 

542. BLACK CURRANT PRE- 

SERVE. 

Stem, pick off the dry blossoms and 
wash black currants. For each pound 
of fruit add 1 pound of sugar and J4 
cup of raspberry juice (squeezed from 
fresh raspberries) ; boil together in a 
porcelain kettle for 10 or 15 minutes 
after boiling begins; stir to dissolve 
sugar. Fill sterilized fruit jars, cover 
arid seal as directed for canning. 



XXXV 
Jellies and Marmalades 



543. DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING 
JELLY. 

Use freshly gathered fruit which is 
just barely ripe. Fruit that is the 
least bit overripe will not make good 
jelly. Reject worm-eaten or unsound 
fruit. 

One or two jelly bags will be needed 
and should be made from coarse cot- 
ton and wool flannel or coarse, strong 
linen crash. Sew up a three-cornered 
piece, cornucopia shape, rounding bag 
at the bottom and trimming off the 
point; turn and sew again. Hem the 
top and run in a strong wire to keep 
bag open, also attach 3 or 4 loops by 
which bag may be hung above a dish. 

Bag should be wrung out in hot 
water before putting in fruit to drip; 
the latter should be added a small quan- 



tity at a time. Work it through with a 
spoon and squeeze juice from pulp un- 
less particularly clear jelly is desired. 
In the latter case, allow to drip without 
squeezing. For economy, two grades 
of jelly may be made, clear jelly 
being from juice allowed to drip with- 
out squeezing, and a second grade may 
be made from juice obtained by squeez- 
ing out all that can be obtained from 
remaining pulp. Strain a small quan- 
tity at a time and remove pulp from 
bag before adding more. 

Jelly is nicer when juices are cooked 
first, separate from the sugar. Crush 
fruit thoroughly in porcelain kettle, 
using potato masher. Boil 3 or 4 
quarts or less at a time in a wide, 
open kettle before adding the sugar. 
Cook unsweetened juice about 20 min- 
utes from the time it bubbles well. It

should thicken when a drop is placed 
upon a cool plate. While juice is heat- 
ing, spread sugar in shallow pans, al- 
lowing a scant cup of sugar for each 
cup of juice which was measured be- 
fore boiling. Set pans of sugar into 
oven, leaving the door partly open. 

When juice has boiled 20 minutes, 
stir in sugar (which should be too hot 
to be held in the hand with comfort). 
Stir quickly until sugar has dissolved, 
then boil 3 or 4 minutes and remove 
at once from the fire. Have ready 
sterilized glasses and covers (or clean 
white or brown papers cut for covers, 
also paper discs cut to just fit inside 
tops of jars). Take glasses one by one 
from boiling hot water, stand upon a 
cloth wrung out in hot water; fill 
glasses, straining jelly into them 
through a cheese cloth wrung out in 
hot water if extra clear jelly is de- 
sired. 

Dip the discs of paper into brandy 
and lay upon top of jelly. Cover the 
glasses (if with paper seal it thoroughly 
with mucilage) and when cool, paint 
over the covers with melted paraffine. 

If jelly is not firm when first made, 
set it in the sun for several days. 

544. CURRANT JELLY. 
Follow directions in No. 543. 

545. CURRANT AND RASPBERRY 
JELLY. 

Use equal parts of currants and rasp- 
berries, following directions in No. 543. 

546. RASPBERRY JELLY. 

Follow directions in No. 543 and 
take special care that the raspberries 
are just ripe, but not at all soft. Rasp- 
berry jelly is better for the addition 
of a little currant. 

547. BLACK RASPBERRY JELLY. 

Follow directions in No. 543. 

548. GRAPE JELLY. 

Pick over, wash and stem Concord 
grapes which are nearly, but not quite 
ripe (wild grapes are better if avail- 
able). Put into large double boiler, 
heat to scalding hot, crush and con- 
tinue to heat for 15 minutes, then pro- 
ceed as in No. 543, 



549. GREEN GRAPE JELLY. 

Proceed as for Grape Jelly, using 
grapes which are just beginning to 
ripen. For green grape jelly allow 
one-half more sugar than regular rule 
(see 543). 

550. PEACH MARMALADE. 

Select ripe, well flavored fruit. Peach 
marmalade should be made when can- 
ning peaches, using for the marmalade 
those which are too soft for canning. 
Put into a porcelain kettle 1 quart of 
water and boil the stones in it for 20 
minutes; then add the peaches quar- 
tered and a little more water if needed 
(water should half cover the fruit). 
Boil fruit 30 minutes in the water, 
stirring almost constantly from the time 
peaches begin to be tender. Add sugar 
in proportion to ^ of a pound for 1 
pound of fruit which was measured be- 
fore cooking. Continue to boil and stir 
for an hour or more and put up in 
sterilized jelly or fruit jars, covering 
with brandied paper and sealing with 
paraffine as for jellies. 

55L GRAPE BUTTER. 

Grape butter or marmalade may be 
made from the pulp left after making 
grape juice (see No. 553). Weigh the 
pulp and skins, add 1 pound of sugar 
to each pound of fruit and boil 45 to 
60 minutes in a porcelain kettle, stir- 
ring constantly. When quite thick, 
press through a coarse wire strainer, 
put into jars as directed for jellies. 

552. ORANGE AND RHUBARB 
MARMALADE. 

Select tart, heavy, smooth skinned 
oranges. Peel in fourths and cook 
until soft in boiling water to cover. 
Drain, scrape out the white portion of 
peel and cut the yellow part into thin 
strips by laying several pieces together 
and slicing with a sharp knife. Re- 
move adhering white skin from the 
peeled oranges, divide into sections and 
remove seeds. Put into a porcelain 
kettle and for each good sized orange 
allow 1 cup of rhubarb which has been 
stripped and cut into Yz inch lengths. 
For each orange and cup of rhubarb 
add IH cups of sugar and a tablespoon 
of lemon juice. Heat to boiling and 
cook slowly for an hour and a half. 
Then stir in ^ cup of chopped nuts 
(blanched almonds, English M^alnuts 
or pecans), for each orange used.

XXXVI 
Fruit Juices 



552. GRAPE JUICE. 



Use the best quality of Concord 
grapes freshly picked and just ripe. 
Stem and wash the grapes, discarding 
all unsound or soft fruit. Put grapes 
into a porcelain or granite preserving 
kettle, allowing 1 pint of water for 
each 3 quarts of grapes; cook slowly 
for 15 or 20 rninutes; after fruit be- 
gins to boil skim occasionally. Pour 
off the free juice, reserving that which 
remains with fruit to be strained sep- 
arately. Allow the first or clearest 
juice to drip through jelly bags and 
keep this apart to be bottled separ- 
ately and labeled "extra clear." Then 
pour remaining juice and fruit into 
jelly bags, a small quantity at a time, 
removing pulp as it is strained, be- 
fore adding more. This second grade 
of juice should be bottled separately. 
It is just as good as the first, but not 
as clear. When all juice is ready, re- 
turn the clear and second grade juices, 
in separate kettles, to the stove and 
bring to boiling, adding 1 cup of hot 
sugar for each quart of juice. Fill 
sterilized bottles at once, using new 
corks. See that bottles are filled full, 
press the corks in well and set aside 
where no draft will strike the bottles. 

Use remaining skins and pulp for 
grape butter (see No. 551). 

554. CURRANT SYRUP. 

Mash currants, cover in an earthen 
bowl and allow to stand 3 or 4 days 
to ferment; then strain through a jelly 
bag and allow 2 pounds of sugar for 
each pint of juice. Put sugar into 



porcelain sauce pan and dissolve slow- 
ly, adding a half cup of water. Bring 
to a boil, add the juice and set aside 
to cool. When cold, fill small clean 
jars, cover and seal with paraffine. Use 
in lemonade and other summer drinks. 
Syrup may be prepared in a similar 
manner from raspberries and other 
small fruits. 

555. TOMATO SYRUP. 

Select good sized ripe tomatoes, 
squeeze out the juice and for each pint 
of clear juice add J^ pound of sugar. 
Stir until sugar is dissolved, bottle, 
seal and set away. It will keep for 
years and makes a delightful beverage 
for the sick, resembling wine in flavor. 

556. CURRANT VINEGAR. 

2 quarts black currants. 

1 pint vinegar. 

IVz pounds white sugar. 

Crush the currants well and place in 
a porcelain dish with the vinegar. Al- 
low to stand 3 or 4 days then strain 
into an earthen jar; add the sugar, 
set the jar in a deep pan of cold water 
and boil for an hour. When cold, 
bottle. It is the better for keeping. 

557. RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

To 4 quarts of red raspberries add 
vinegar to just cover. Allow rasp- 
berries and vinegar to stand 24 hours. 
Scald and strain; add sugar, allowing 
1 pound for each pint of juice; boil 
20 minutes, skim well and when cold 
bottle and seal.

559. CUCUMBER PICKLE. 

Use freshly gathered cucumbers, 
wash, but handle carefully so as not to 
bruise. For each 100 small cucumbers 
take 1 pint fine salt, dissolve it in 
boiling water to cover cucumbers, and

XXXIX 
For Invalids 



577. BEEF TEA. 



Shred Yi pound of lean beef (rump 
or round) and allow to stand in 2 cups 
of cold water for three-quarters of an 
hour. Put into a glass jar, cover 
loosely, then set into a sauce pan of 
warm water and keep over a moderate 
heat for IH hours. Do not allow 
water to boil or even nearly boil; just 
keep it fairly hot. Strain the juice 
through a napkin, add a teaspoon of 
finely shredded raw lean meat, allow 
to stand a few moments and add a 
iittle salt, when it is ready to serve. 

578. BEEF BROTH. 

When purchasing meat for broth, ask 
for the neck, as this is the most nutri- 
tious. Chop meat and bone quite small, 
having about Yz as much bone as meat. 
Put a pound of beef into a large glass 
jar, add 1 quart of cold water, cover 
with plate and set into a deep sauce 
pan_ of water. Simmer for 4 hours, 
strain into a smaller sauce pan and 
boil until reduced nearly one-half; re- 
move all fat and scum. 

Seasoning should be influenced by 
the taste and preference of the in- 
valid. A little celery salt or a stalk 
of celery, allowed to simmer in the 
broth, is pleasant. Ground pepper 
should not be used. If pepper is de- 
sired, use a red pepper pod and allow 
it to remain in the broth for a couple 
of minutes. 

579. BEEF JUICE. 

Ask for a thin slice of rump steak, 
cut away fat and just sear over the 
outside in a broiler or hot pan. Scrape 



the meat into shreds with a knife, warm 
a beef press or lemon squeezer in hot 
water, dry it and squeeze juice from 
the meat into a glass; place glass in 
warm water and heat the juice a little, 
add a pinch of salt and serve. 

580. MUTTON BROTH. 

Cut into small pieces 1 pound of 
mutton neck, and put it in a quart of 
cold water. Cover closely and "boil un- 
salted until it falls to pieces. Strain 
and add 1 tablespoon of rice or barley 
which has been soaked in a little warm 
water. Simmer J^ hour, stir often, 
then add 4 tablespoons of milk, a little 
salt and a bit of chopped parsley if 
liked. If pepper is desired, allow a 
red pepper pod to remain in the broth 
for two minutes. Remove pod, simmer 
again 5 minutes, taking care not to 
burn it. 

Chicken broth may be prepared in the 
same way. Crack the bones well be- 
fore cooking. 

581. VEAL BROTH. 

Trim surplus fat from a piece of veal 
neck and to a pound of lean (with 
bone) add a quart of cold water. Sim- 
mer gently two hours, strain and cool. 
When ready to use, remove all fat, put 
a small quantity of the stock in a sauce 
pan and heat; salt slightly, season a 
mornent with red pepper pod and add 
a little soaked rice or barley if de- 
sired. 

Mutton Broth may also be prepared 
by this method and in the latter case 
a bit of onion is sometimes added when 
first cooking the meat to destroy the 
mutton flavor. 



140 



THE MONARCH COOK BOOK. 



582. CHICKEN BROTH. 

Cut a chicken neatly into pieces, add 
3 quarts of cold water and a stalk of 
celery; cover and simmer slowly for 
two hours. Carefully remove all fat, 
strain, salt a little and serve. If de- 
sired, a little rice may be boiled with 
the chicken, being added half an hour 
before chicken is done. 

583. FLAXSEED LEMONADE. 

Into a covered vessel pour 1 quart of 
boiling water upon four tablespoons of 
flaxseed. Steep without boiling for 
three hours, then add the juice of 2 
lemons and sweeten to taste. If too 
thick, add more cold water. Excellent 
for colds. 

584. OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Pour 4 cups cold water over J4 cup 
steel cut oatmeal (or H cup rolled 
oats) in sauce pan. Add Ya teaspoon 
salt and cook 45 minutes after it begins 
to boil, allowing it to bubble gently. 
Strain, add more salt if liked, also 
a half cup of sweet cream or rich milk 
and sweeten to taste. 



585. CURRANT JELLY WATER. 

Dissolve a teaspoon of currant jelly 
in a glass of cold water and add one 
lump of sugar. 

586. APPLE WATER. 

Mash a baked apple and pour over it 
a cup of boiling water. When cool, 
strain and sweeten to taste. Add a 
little lemon juice if permitted. 

587. SLIPPERY ELM BARK TEA. 

Break the bark into bits, pour boiling 
water over it, cover closely, and allow 
to stand until cold. For summer com- 
plaints, add a little sugar and ice; for 
colds, add lemon juice. 

588. TOAST WATER. 

Toast a large slice of wheat bread 
until a deep brown all over, but do not 
blacken or burn it. Lay the toast in a 
covered earthen dish, cover with boiling 
water, cover the dish closely and steep 
until cold. Strain and unless the 
physician forbids, add a bit of lemon 
juice.
