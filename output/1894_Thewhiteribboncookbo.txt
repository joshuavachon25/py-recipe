PREFACE 

The beoipes in this volume have been most 

carefully selected and are the result of practical 

experience, all of them having been tested by 

myself or by other practical housekeepers. I 

am under obligatioSis to many friends in America 

and in Europe, and I wish to extend thanks 

specially to those women in all parts of the 

world, interested in the cause of temperance, who 

have sent contributions. I trust that they and 

all who may have occasion to use this little book 

will be satisfied with my effort to prove that 

wine, brandy and spirituous liquors of any kind 

may be dispensed with, and that no culinary 

requirement necessitates the introduction of 

these poisons into any household.

THE WHITE RIBBON 

Cook Booli 



FROM the richest to the poorest, the selec- 
tion and preparation of food often becomes 
one of the chief objects in Kfe. The resources 
of every family may be greatly increased by the 
knowledge of what may be called trilling 
details, and refinement in the art of cookery 
depends much more on the manner of doing a 
thing than on the cost attending it. To cook 
well is immensely more important to the middle 
and working classes than to the rich, for they 
who live by the " sweat of their brow," whether 
mentally or physically, must have the requisite 
strength to support their labor. Every wife, 
mother or sister should be a good plain cook. 
If she has servants she can direct them, and if 
not, so much the more must depend upon her- 
self. 

An old saying, to be found in one of the 
earliest cookery books — "First catch your 
hare," etc. — has more significance than is gener- 
ally supposed. To catch your hare well, you 
must spend your income judiciously. This is 
the chief thing. In our artificial state of society, 
every income, to keep up appearances, has at 



8 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

least half as much more to do as it can afford. 
In the selection of provisions the hest is gener- 
ally the cheapest. Half a pound of good meat 
is more nutritious than three times the amount 
of inferior. As to vegetables, buy them fresh. 
Above all, where an income is small and there 
are many to feed, be careful that all the nour- 
ishment is retained in the food that is pur- 
chased. This is to be effected by careful cook- 
ing. Cleanliness is an imperative condition. 
Let all cooking-utensils be clean and in order. 
Uncleanliness produces disorder, and disorder 
confusion. In the cooking of meat by any pro- 
cess whatever, remember, above all, to cook the 
juices in it, not out of it. 

Boiling. 

In boiling, put the meat, if fresh, into cold 
water, or, if salt, into luke-warm. Simmer it 
very gently until done. It is a general rule to 
allow a quarter of an hour to every pound of 
meat; but in this, as in everything else, judg- 
ment must be used according to the bone and 
shape of the joint, and according to the taste of 
the eaters. All kinds of meat, fish, flesh and 
fowl, should be boiled very slowly, and the 
scum taken off just as boiling commences. If 
meats are allowed to boil too fast they 
toughen, all their juices are extracted, and only 
the fleshy fiber, without sweetness, is left; if 
they boil too long they are reduced to a jelly, 



Roasting — Broiling. 9 

and their nourishing properties are transferred 
to the water in which they are boiled. Nothing 
is more difficult than to boil meat exactly as it 
should be; close attention and good judgment 
are indispensable. 

Roasting. 

In roasting meat the gravy may be retained 
in it by pricking the joint all over with a fork 
and rubbing in pepper and salt. Mutton and 
beef may be underdone; veal and pork must be 
well cooked. Young meat generally requires 
more cooking than old; thus lamb and veal 
must be more done than mutton and beef. In 
frosty weather meat will require a little more 
time for cooking. All joints for roasting will 
improve by hanging a day or so before cooking. 

Broiling. 

Broiling is the most nutritious method of 
cooking mutton and pork chops, or beef and 
rump steaks, kidneys (which should never be 
cut open before cooking), etc. Have the grid- 
iron clean, and put over a clear fire; put the 
meat on it; "keep it turned often." This last 
is a common direction in books, but the reason 
why is never stated : it is to keep the gravy in 
the meat. By letting the one side of a steak 
be well done before turning, you will see the 
red gravy settled on the top of the steak, and so 
the meat is hard and spoiled. This is cooking 
the gravy out, instead of keeping it in to nour- 
ish the consumer. Never stick the fork in the 
meaty part; you will lose gravy if you do. Be 



10 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

sure to turn often, and generally the chop or 
steak is done if it feels firm to the fork; if not 
done, it will be soft and flabby. 

Frying. 

Although very bad for chops or steaks, the 
frying-pan is indispensable for some things, 
such as veal cutlets, lamb chops (sometimes), 
fish, pancakes, etc. Most meats and fish are 
usually fried with egg and bread crumbs. The 
frying-pan must be kept clean. This is very 
essential, as the dirt that sticks to the pan ab- 
sorbs the fat, prevents the meat browning and 
turns it black. Have a clear, brisk fire, for the 
quicker meat is fried the tenderer it is. Ac- 
cording to what is to be fried, put httle or 
much fat in the pan; fish and pancakes require 
a considerable quantity. The fat must always 
boil before putting the meat into it; if not, it 
coddles. For veal cutlets a little butter is best 
and most economical, as it helps to make the 
gravy. Some cooks have a few slices of bacon 
with cutlets or liver ; the fat from this, if the 
bacon be not rank, will do very nicely; and if 
the meat be well flavored and fried quickly, and 
some nice gravy made to it, few persons would 
know the difference. Some like thickened and 
some plain gravy to these fried meats ; some a 
large quantity, others very little; all these 
must be accommodated. To make these gravies, 
have ready a little burnt sugar to brown with ; 
empty the pan of the fat, if it be, as is most 
likely, too rank to use; put warm water in the 
pan; mix very smoothly sufficient flour and 



Cooking Time-Table. 11 

water to thicken it to taste; into this put as 
much butter as you like to use (a little will do, 
more will make it richer); pepper and salt it 
sufficiently ; stir it very smoothly into the pan 
while the water is only warm; stir it well until 
it boils, and brown it with the burnt sugar to 
your taste. Care must be taken, after the gravy 
boils, not to let it boil fast for any length of 
time, as all thickened gravies, hashes, etc., boil 
away very fast and dry up; neither must it 
stand still in the pan ; a whitish scum then set- 
tles on the top and spoils the ajDpearance of it. 

N. B. — For all frying purposes be particular 
that the pan is thoroughly hot before using.

SOUPS 



THE true economy of soups lies in the fact 
that so many things which might other- 
wise be wasted may be utilized in making 
them. In households where expenditure is not 
so much a consideration, it may be deemed ex- 
pedient always to purchase fresh meat for the 
sole purpose of making soup, but, in such 
instances, the soup could certainly not be re- 
garded as an economical addition to a dinner. 
Still, where Economy must rule, the resources 
from which she may draw a tureen of good 
soup, without having recourse to the butcher, 
are ample. Almost everything that is used as 
food may be converted into soup. Scra23S of 
meat, bread, vegetables, rice, sago, spare milk, 
and, better still, bones left from the meat after 
cooking, may, with a little ingenuity, be made 
into excellent, nourishing soup. 

The basis of all good soup is stock. This 
may be made from meat or bones and flavored 
with vegetables. Let it be borne in mind that 
no good stock can be made the day it is required 
for SOU23. It should be made the previous day, 
strained into a basin, and allowed to stand until 
required, when the fat, which would render the 
soup so objectionable, will have cooled on the 
top and may be taken off entirely. The stock 
may then be used as the basis of any kind of 
soup. 

In making stocks or soups care must be 
taken to simmer gently, not boil, or they will 
be found wanting both in flavor and nourish- 
ment. The lid of the stock-pot must be kept 
tightly closed, or there will be considerable 

14 



Soups. 15 

•waste daring the long time which the contents 
must of necessity simmer. It will be necessary 
to remove the lid a few times in order to take 
off the scum as it rises. 

"When preparing the stock, all the meat used 
should be cut into small pieces, and the bones 
broken or crushed. Cold water and salt should 
be added, and the whole brought very gradually 
to simmering point, the vegetables being added 
after the stock has been well skimmed. 

On no account must stock be left in an iron 
stock-pot any length of time, or it will contract 
a very unpleasant flavor. It must be poured 
into an earthenware vessel and remain uncov- 
ered. To those about to purchase a stock-pot 
we would recommend an earthenware rather 
than an iron one as being more cleanly and not 
necessitating the emptying out of the stock 
when finished. 



To Color Soups — To obtain a green color 
pound spinach leaves and add the juice obtained 
to the stock. For a red color use tomatoes, with- 
out the skins and seeds. For amber grate a 
carrot and mix with the soup, and for a rich 
brown use burnt sugar or burnt onions. 

Macaroni Soup — Five cents' worth of bones, 
1 tablespoonful salt and peppercorns, 1 good- 
sized turnip and 4 leeks, 2 carrots, 4 onions, 2 
cloves, 1 blade of mace, 1 bunch of herbs, (mar- 
joram, thyme, lemon-thyme and parsley), }^ lb. 
macaroni. 

Time required, about 2^ hours. Break up the 
bones and put them into a stewpan with cold 
water enough to cover them and 1 quart more. 



16 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

When on the point of boiling put in a tablespoon- 
ful of salt to help the scum to rise, then take the 
turnip, peel it and cut it in quarters; then take 
2 carrots, wash and scrape them; take also 4 leeks, 
wash and shred them up finely; now take 4 
onions, peel them and stick 2 cloves into them; 
then skim the soup well and put in the vegetables, 
add a blade of mace and a teaspoonf ul of pepper- 
corns, then allow soup to simmer for 2)^ hours, 
then take }^ lb. of macaroni, wash and put in a 
stewpan with plenty of cold water and a little 
salt. Allow it to boil until tender, then strain off 
the water and pour some cold water on, to wash 
the macaroni again; then cut in small pieces and 
it is ready for the soup. When the soup is ready 
for use strain it over the macaroni. 

Milk Soup — 4 potatoes, 2 leeks or onions, 2 
oz. butter, pepper, }^ oz. salt, 1 pint milk, 3 
tablespoonfuls tapioca. 

Put 2 quarts of water into a stewpan, then take 4 
potatoes, peel and cut in quarters, take also 2 
leeks, wash well in cold water and cut them up; 
when the water boils put in potatoes and leeks, 
then add the butter, salt and pepper to taste, 
Allow it to boil to a mash, then strain the soup 
through a colander, working the vegetables 
through also; return the pulp and the soup to the 
stewpan, add one pint of milk to it and boil; 
when boiling sprinkle in by degrees tapioca, 
stirring all the time; then let it boil for 16 min- 
utes gently. 

Spring Vegetable Soup — 2 lbs. shin of beef, 
2 lbs. knuckle of veal, a little salt, 2 young carrots,

soda. 

Cut the meat from the bone — do not use the 
fat; break the bones in halves; do not use the 



Soups. 17 

marrow. Pat the meat and bones into a stock- 
pot with five pints of cold water, a teaspoonful 
of salt will assist the scum to rise, boil quickly 
and remove scum as it rises, then simmer gently 
6 hours. Cut carrots and turnips in slices; the 
head of celery and leek wash well and cut in 
squares ; cut the cauliflower in sprigs after wash- 
ing. One hour before serving add vegetables; 
the sprigs of cauliflower can be put in 15 minutes 
before serving. Put one gill of peas, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a quarter of a saitspoonful of soda 
into boiling water and boil 15 minutes, then 
put peas in tureen and put soup over them. 

Good Oravy Soup— l lb, beef, l pound veal, 
1 lb. mutton, 6 quarts water, 1 crust of bread, 1 
carrot, 1 onion, a little summer savory, 4 cloves, 
pepper and a blade of mace. 

Cut the meat in small pieces and put into the 
water, with the crust of bread toasted very crisp. 
Peel the carrot and onion, and, with a little 
summer savory, pepper, 4 cloves and a blade of 
mace, put in the stewpan. Cover it and let it 
stew slowly until the liquid is reduced to 3 qts. 
Then strain it, take off the fat, and serve with 
sippets of toast. 

Scotch Mutton Broth — 2 qts. of water, neck 
of mutton, 4 or 5 carrots, 4 or 5 turnips, 3 onions, 
4 large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, salt to taste, 
some chopped parsley. 

Soak a neck of mutton in water for an hour; 
cut off the scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with 
two quarts of water. As soon as it boils skim it * 
well, and then simmer it an hour and a half; then 
take the best end of the mutton, cut it into pieces 
(two bones in each), take some of the fat off, and 
put in as many as you think proper; skim the 
moment the fresh meat boils up, and every quar- 
ter of an hour afterwards. Have ready 4 or 5 



18 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

carrots, the same number of turnips, and 3 
onions, all cut, but not small, and put them in 
soon enough to get quite tender; add 4 large 
spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wetted with cold 
water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt 
to taste, and serve all together. Twenty minutes 
before serving put in some chopped parsley. It 
is an excellent winter dish. 

A Eoast Beef and Boiled Turkey Soup — 

Bones of a turkey and beef, 2 or three carrots, 2 
or 3 onions, 2 or 3 turnips, 3^ doz. cloves, pepper, 
salt, tomatoes, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, some

3^ dozen cloves, pepper, salt and tomatoes, if 
you have any; boil it 4 hours, then strain all out. 
Put the soup back into the pot, mix 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour into a little cold water; stir it 
into the soup; give it one boil. Cut some bread 
dice-form, lay it in the bottom of the tureen, 
pour the soup on it, and color with a little soy.

with a little of the stock. Return the whole to 
the saucepan, add the milk. Sprinkle in the sago 
gradually, stirring well. When the sago has 
boiled clear and tender, stir in the butter and 
serve. If water be used instead of stock, 3^ tea- 
spoonful of salt should be added with the pota- 
toes and leeks, and pepper to taste.

cold water, and take off the second scum; then 
cut up the carrots, onions and celery and throw 
in the pot; add a little more salt, a few allspice, 
and coriander seeds; let it simmer 6 hours, color 
the soup with a little soy, and strain it through 
a fine cloth; take off any fat that may be on the 
soup with a sheet of paper; before sending to 
table boil the soup, and place in the tureen a 
little fried lean ham cut into small pieces. 

Griblet Soup — 3 sets of ducks' giblets, 2 lbs.

20 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

adding 1 oz. of butter and i^ pint of milk. 
Serve with fried bread or toast. 

Oyster Soup a la Reiiie— 2 or 3 doz. small 
oysters, some pale veal stock, mace, cayenne, 1 
pint boiling cream. 

Two or 3 dozen small oysters to each pint of 
soup should be prepared. Take the beards and 
simmer them separately in a little very pale veal 
stock 30 minutes. Heat 2 quarts of the stock, 
flavor with mace and cayenne, and add the 
strained stock from the oyster beards. Simmer 
the fish in their own liquor, add to it the soup 
and 1 pint of boiling cream. Put the oysters in 
a tureen, pour over the soup and serve. If not 
thick enough thicken with arrowroot or butter 
mixed with flour. 

Chicken Soup (Brown) — 1 or 2 fowls, a bunch 
of herbs, 1 carrot, 1 onion, 2 oz. lean ham, 2 oz. 
butter, pepper and salt, 2 quarts good stock, and 
a little roux, a few allspice, a little grated nut- 
meg and mace. 

Cut up the carrot and onion, and fry in 2 oz. 
of good butter, a nice light brown; add the ham 
and fowls cut up small, taking care to break up 
the bones with a chopper, add the stock, and 
boil until the fowl is cooked to rags; thicken

salt to every gallon of water, 4 turnips, 2 carrots, 
some celery, 4 young leeks, 6 cloves, 1 onion, 3^ 
teaspoonful peppercorns, some savory herbs. 

Various parts of beef are used for this; if the 
meat, after the soup is made, is to be sent to the 
table, rump steak or the best parts of the leg 



Soups. 21 

are generally used, but if soup alone is wanted, 
part of the shin with a pound from the neck will 
do very well. Pour cold water on the beef in 
the soup pot and heat the soup slowly, the slower 
the better, letting it simmer beside the fire, 
strain it carefully, adding a little cold water now 
and then, put in 2 oz. of salt for every gallon of 
water, skim again, and put in four turnips, two 
carrots, some celery, 4 young leeks, 6 cloves 
stuck into an onion, half a teaspoonful of 
peppercorns, and some savory herbs; let the 
soup boil gently for six hours; strain. 

Milk Soil}) with Termicelli— Salt, 5 pints 
boiling milk, 5 oz. fresh vermicelli. 

Throw a small quantity of salt into 5 pints of 
boiling milk, and then drop lightly into it 5 oz. 
ox good fresh vermicelli; keep the milk stirred 
as this is added, to prevent its gathering into 
lumps, and continue to stir it very frequently 
from 15 to 20 minutes, or until it is perfectly 
tender. The addition of a little pounded sugar 
and powdered cinnamon makes this a very palat- 
able dish. For soup of this description, rice, 
semolina, sago, cocoa-nut, sago and macaroni 
may all be used, but they will be required in 
rather smaller jjroportions to the milk. 

Green Pea Soup— 4 lbs. beef, }4 V^- green 
peas, 1 gal. water, 3^ cup rice-flour, salt, pepper 
and chopped parsley. 

Four lbs. beef, cut into small pieces, }4 pk. green 
peas, 1 gallon water, }^ cup of rice-flour, salt, 
pepperand chopped parsley; boil the empty pods 
of the peas in the water 1 hour before putting in 
the beef. Strain them out, add the beef, and boil 
slowly for 1}^ hour longer; j-^ hour before serv- 
ing, add the shelled peas, and 20 ntinutes later, the 
rice-flour with salt, pepper and parsley. After 



22 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

adding the rice-fiour, stir frequently, to prevent 
scorching. Strain into a hot tureen. 

Celery Soup — The white part of 3 heads of 
celery, ^ lb. rice, 1 onion, 1 quart stock, 2 quarts 
milk, pepper and salt, and a little roux. 

Cut up the celery and onions very small, boil 
them in the stock until quite tender, add the 
milk and the rice, and boil together until quite 
a pulp, add pepper and salt and a little roux, 
strain through a fine hair sieve or a metal strain- 
er, and boil a few minutes, taking care it does 
not burn. Serve some small croutons or fried 
bread with it. 

Tomato Soup — 4 lbs. tomatoes, 2 onions, 1 
carrot, 2 quarts of stock or broth, pepper and 
salt and a little roux, 2 oz. fresh butter. 

Cut up the onions and carrot, place them in a 
stewpan with the butter, and lightly fry them. 
Take the seeds out of the tomatoes, then put 
them in the stewpan with the fried onions and

the colander. Season to taste with salt and pep- 
per, add the asparagus tips, and as soon as the

turn into a soup tureen, where you have prev-

FISH 

FRESH water fish have often a muddy smell 
and taste. To take this off soak the fish 
in strong salt and water after it is nicely 
cleaned, then dry and dress it. The fish must 
be put in the water while cold and set to do 
very gently, or the outside will break before 
the inner part is done. Crimp fish should be 
put into boiling water, and when it boils up put 
a little cold water in, to check extreme heat, 
and simmer it a few minutes. Small fish nicely 
fried, covered with egg and crumbs, make a 
dish far more elegant than if served plain. 
Great attention should be paid to the garnish- 
ing of fish. Use plenty of horse-radish, parsley 
and lemon. If fish is to be fried or broiled it 
must be wrapped in a clean cloth after it is well 
cleaned. When perfectly dry, wet with an egg 
(if for frying) and sprinkle the finest bread 
crumbs over it; then, with a large quantity of 
lard or drijoping, boiling hot, plunge the fish 
into it and fry a light brown; it can then be 
ilaid on blotting-paj)er to receive any grease. 
JButter gives a bad color; oil fries the finest 
Icolor for those who will allow for the expense. 
Garnish with raw or fried parsley, which must 
be thus done: When washed and picked throw 
it again into clean water; when the lard' or 
dripping boils, throw the parsley into it imme- 
diately from the water, and instantly it will be 
green and crisp, and must be taken up with a 
'slice. If fish is to be broiled, it must be sea- 
isoned, flavored and put on a gridiron that is 
very clean, which, when hot, should be rubbed 
[with a piece of suet to prevent the fish from

haddock, or salmon, pick out the flesh carefully, 
and mince it, not too finely; melt a piece of but- 
ter in a saucepan, add a small pinch of flour and 
some hot milk; stir on the fire until the mixture 
thickens, then put in pepper, salt, and a little 
grated nutmeg, together with some finely-chop- 
ped parsley, and, lastly, the minced fish. As 
soon as the whole is quite hot, turn it out on a 



38 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

dish to get cold, then fashion and finish the cro- 
quettes as in the first recipe. 

Halibut (Boiled) — Halibut, salted water. 

Allow the fish to lie in cold salt water for an 
hour. Wipe dry in a clean cloth and score the 
skin, then put into the fish-kettle with cold salted 
water sufficient to cover it. Let it come slowly 
to the boil, and allow from }-£ to % of an hour 
for a piece weighing 4 or 5 lbs. When ready, 
drain, and serve with egg sauce. 

Halibut (Baked) — Halibut, a little butter, 
salt and water, a tablespoonful of walnut catsup, 
a dessertspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, the 
juice of a lemon, a little brown flour. 

A piece of halibut weighing 5 or 6 lbs., lay in 
salt water for 2 hours. Wipe in a clean cloth 
and score the skin. Have the oven tolerably 
hot, and bake about 1 hour. Melt a little butter 
in hot water and baste the fish occasionally. It 
should be of a fine brown color. Any gravy that 
is in the dripping-pan mix with a little boiling 
water, then stir in the walnut catsup and Wor- 
cestershire sauce, the juice of the lemon, and 
thicken with the brown flour (the flour should be 
mixed with a little cold water previously), give 
one boil and serve in sauce-boat. 

Baked Herring-S or Sprats — Herrings, all- 
spice, salt, black pepper, 1 onion and a few bay- 
leaves, vinegar. 

Wash and drain without wiping them; season 
with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few 
whole cloves; lay them in a pan with plenty of 
black pepper, 1 onion, and a few bay-leaves; add 
vinegar enough to cover them. Put paper 
over the pan, and bake in a slow oven. If you 
like throw saltpetre over them the night before, 
to make them look red. Gut, but do not open 
them. 



Fish. 39 

Fish Chowder — Two lbs. solid fish-shreds, % 
lb. salt pork, 4 onions, 10 potatoes, salt and pep- 
per, 2 tablespoonfuls farina, milk. 

Take }^ lb. fat salt pork, cut into slices, and 
fry out well. Slice four large onions and fry in 
the pork fat until they are a light brown. Stir 
Constantly to prevent burning, and thus make 
the chowder better. Put this into a pot with 3 
qts. of boiling water and let it boil 20 minutes. 
Skim out the pieces of pork and onion and add 
10 potatoes, sliced, not too thin, and boil 20 min- 
utes. Then add 2 lbs. of solid fish-shreds and 
boil 10 minutes if the fish is not cooked. Add 
salt and pepper to taste. When cooked stir in 
slowly a thickening made of 2 tablespoonfuls of 
farina mixed in cold milk, and let it boil up once 
only. Put the pot back on the fire, and after 
letting it stand a few moments skim off the 
scum which will rise to the top, and serve. 

Planked Shad — Secure a handsome, thick 
oak board, and have some holes bored, with 
stout wooden pegs to fit; spread the dressed fish 
open on the board, securing it with the pegs. 
Rest the end of the plank in a shallow pan and 
set all before a clear fire; put a little salt and 
water in the pan and baste the fish often, adding 
when it is nearly done a tablespoonful of melted 
butter and half as much walnut catsup. If the 
board is handsome serve the shad on it, but it 
can be laid on a hot dish and the gravy, with a 
little walnut catsup added, poured over. Serve 
with pickled walnuts. 



OYSTERS, SHEIekFISH, ET6. 

Lobsters (Potted) — Lobsters, mace, white 
pepper, nutmeg, salt and butter. 

Half boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into 
small pieces, season with mace, white pepper, 
nutmeg and salt, press close into a pot, and 
cover with butter, bake 3^ hour; put the spawn 
in. When cold, take the lobster out, and put it 
into the pots with a little of the butter. Beat the 
other butter in a mortar with some of the spawn, 
then mix that colored butter with as much as 
will be sufficient to cover the pots, and strain it. 
Cayenne may be added if approved. 

Lobster Croquettes — Lobster, pepper, salt, 
powdered mace, bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls 
of butter, egg, biscuit, parsley. 

To the meat of a well-boiled lobster, chopped 
fine, add pepper, salt, and powdered mace. Mix 
with this one quarter as much bread crumbs, 
well rubbed, as you have meat; make into 
pointed balls, with 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 
melted; roll these in beaten egg, then in biscuit 
powdered fine, and fry in butter or very nice 
sweet lard. Serve dry and hot, and garnish with 
crisped parsley. This is a delicious supper dish 
or entree. 

Crabs (Hot) — One good-sized crab, pepper, 
salt, bread crumbs, milk, cream, or oiled but- 
ter, parsley. 

For this, 1 good-sized crab or 3 or 4 small 
ones may be used. The meat must be picked' 
from the claws and the soft inside from the body; 
season with pepper and salt, add a small quan- 
tity of bread crumbs, and moisten with milk, or, 
better still, a few spoonfuls of cream or oiled 
butter. When well mixed, put it into the large 
shell, strewing fresh bread crumbs over the top, 
and sprinkling some oiled butter over these; let 
it remain in the oven just long enough to get hot 
40 



Oysters, Shellfish, Etc. 41 

through and to be a nice golden-brown color. It 
should be served very hot on a napkin garnished 
with parsley. 

Crabs (Boiled) — Crabs, salt water, sweet oil. 

Boil them in salt and water 20 minutes; take 
them out, break off the claws, wipe the crabs, 
throw away the small claws, and crack the large 
ones and send to table. Rub a little sweet oil on 
the shells. 

Oysters on Toast — Drain the liquor from a 
qt. of oysters; cut each into 4 pieces, and strain 
through coarse muslin back into the sauce. 
When it boils again, dip out a small cupful and 
keep it hot. Stir into that left on the range a 
liberal teaspoonful of butter rolled in a scant 
teaspoonful of cornstarch. In another vessel 
heat }4, cup of milk. Stir the oysters into the 
thickened liquor; season with pepper and salt, 
and cook, after they are scalding hot, 5 minutes 
before adding the milk. Line a hot platter with 
neat slices of crustless toast, buttered, wet with 
the reserved liquor, and cover with the oysters. 

Oysters (Stewed) — Oysters, a piece of mace, 
some lemon peel, a few white peppers, cream, 
butter, and flour. 

Open and separate the liquor from them, then 
wash them from the grit; strain the liquor, and 
put with the oysters a piece of mace and lemon 
peel, and a few white peppers. Simmer them 
very gently, and put some cream, and a little 
flour and butter. Serve with sippets. 

Oysters (Stewed) — Liquor from 2 qts. of 
oysters, one teacupful of hot water, salt, pepper, 
2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 1 cupful of milk. 

Drain the liquor from 2 qts. of firm, plump 
oysters; mix with it a small teacupful of hot 
water, add a little salt and pepper, and set over 
the fire in a saucepan. Let it boil up once, put 



42 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

in the oysters, let them boil for 5 minutes or less 
— not more. When they " rnfQe," add two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. The instant it is melted and 
well stirred in, put in a large cupful of boiling 
milk, and take the saucepan from the fire. Serve 
with oyster or cream biscuits, as soon as pos- 
sible. Oysters become tough and tasteless when 
cooked too much or left to stand too long after 
they are withdrawn from the fire. 

Oyster Sausages — One doz. large oysters, 
^ lb. rump steak, a little seasoning of herbs, 
pepper and salt. 

Chop all fine, and roll them into the form of 

sausages. 

Aug-els on Horseback — Oysters, bacon. 

Trim the beards from as many oysters as may 
be required, wrap each in a very thin shaving of 
fat, streaky bacon (cold boiled bacon is the best); 
run them one after the other onto a silver 
skewer, and hold them over a toast in front of a 
clear fire until the bacon is slightly crisp; serve 
on the toast immediately. 

Escalloped Lobster — Select lobsters that 
are rather above the medium size; plunge them 
in boiling water for half an hour. When cool 
enough to handle, split in two and remove the 
entrails; cut the meat into dice, being careful to 
pick out aU the meat from the claws. Prepare 
in a farina kettle a pint of rich gravy made from 
equal parts of cream and milk, thickened with a 
heaping tablespoonful of flour, creamed with 2 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Season well with salt, 
cayenne pepper and a tiny pinch of grated nut- 
meg; add the lobster to the sauce thus made, 
place in a buttered baking-dish, cover with bread 
crumbs; place in a hot oven for 10 minutes to 
brown. 



Oysters, Shellfish, Etc, 43 

Barbecued Oysters — Drain a dozen large 
oysters, dust them over with pepper and cut an 
equal number of thin slices of bacon of about 
the same size. First put a slice of bacon and 
then an oyster and bacon and so on, alternating, 
on an iron skewer, taking care not to crowd 
them, and roast in a very hot oven until the 
bacon begins to crisp. Serve hot in a covered 
dish. 

Panned Oysters — Select large, fat oysters, 
split and toast round crackers, and spread in the 
bottom of a pan; drain the liquor from the oys- 
ters, put in a saucepan and set on the stove to 
boil; skim, and season with pepper, salt and a 
little batter; moisten the toasted crackers with 
hot liquor, and lay the oysters over; spread with 
bits of butter and set in a hot oven for 15 min- 
utes. 

Scalloped Oysters — Butter a baking-dish; 
fill it with alternate layers of rolled crackers and 
oysters; over each layer of oysters spread bits of 
butter and dash pepper — not salt, as it will 
shrivel them. Heat the liquor of the oysters, 
add to it 1 teacupful of cream, season to taste 
and pour over the oysters. Set in a moderate 
oven and bake nearly an hour. 

Oysters (Fried) — Carefully dry in a clean 
cloth a dozen large oysters. In a bright frying- 
pan put 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of good butter, 
and as soon as this comes to a boil throw in the 
oysters and whip them out with a strainer as 
soon as they begin to curl up, and serve imme- 
diately. Oysters cooked in this manner are 
delicious, but the butter must be heated to the 
point when the blue smoke hovers over the pan. 
To 3 well-beaten eggs add }4 pt, of oyster juice, 
a teaspoonful of salt and black or cayenne pep- 
per, according to taste. Work into this a gill of 



44 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

sweet oil, until the whole becomes a batter. On 
a bed of cracker dnst on the table lay your oys- 
ters, then take them one by one by the beard, 
dip them in the mixture and then in the bread 
crumbs. Repeat this three or four times, first in 
the egg mixture, then in the bread crumbs. 
Place each oyster on the table by itself. 
Do not pile one on top of the other or they will 
become heavy. Now fry in a pan of hot butter 
and serve on a hot dish. 

Oysters (Roast) — Take a dozen large oysters, 
wash them clean and place them on the coals of 
a bright fire. As soon as the shells open, pour 
the juice into a hot soup-plate, remove the oys- 
ters from the shells with a knife, put them in the 
plate with a lump of butter and serve while hot. 
Oysters treated in this manner retain more of 
their flavor and are easier digested than when 
cooked in any other way. 

Oysters (Stewed) — To a pint of milk add 
the juice of 25 oysters, a teaspoonful of salt, pep- 
per according to taste. Let it boil for 1 or 2 
minutes, then add your oysters and a generous 
lump of butter. 

Oyster Patties — Make a rich paste, roll it 
out 3^ in. thick, then turn a teacup down on the 
paste, and, with the point of a sharp pen-knife, 
mark the paste lightly round the edge of the cup. 
Then with the point of the knife make a circle 
about 3^ in. from the edge; cut this circle half 
way through. Place them on tins, and bake in a 
quick oven. Remove the center, and fill with 
oysters seasoned and warmed over the fire. 

Oyster Omelet — Six eggs, whites and yolks 
beaten separately; 1 tablespoonful of cream, ^ 
teaspoonful of corn starch wet with the cream, a 
saltspoonful of salt and a dust of pepper; a 
dozen fine oysters broiled. 



Oysters, Shellfish, Etc. 45 

Beat yolks well, adding the cream and corn- 
starch; stir in the stiffened whites lightly; have 
ready a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, 
hissing hot, but not browned. Pour in the ome- 
let, and as soon as it sets at the edges, loosen 
with a knife and shake gently with a uniform 
motion from side to side, until the center is 
almost set. The oysters should have been 
broiled before you began the omelet. To do 
this, roll them in fine cracker-crust, salted and 
peppered, broil quickly over a clear fire, trans- 
fer to a hot dish, put a bit of butter on each, and 
cover and keep hot while the omelet is cooking. 
When this is done, line one-half of it, as it lies 
on the pan, with the oysters, fold the other over 
dexterously and reverse the frying-pan quickly 
upon the heated dish in which it is to be served. 



POULTRY AND GAME 

IN choosing ducks, be careful to secure 
those with plump bodies and thick and 
yellowish feet, and, to insure their being 
tender, it is advisable to let their hang a day or 
two. In choosing turkeys, the hens are prefer- 
able for boiling on account of their whiteness 
and tenderness. 

Partridges in perfection will have dark-colored 
bills and yellowish legs ; the time they should 
be kept entirely depends upon the taste of those 
for whom they are intended, as what some people 
consider delicious, to others would be disgust- 
ing and offensive. 

Kabbits when young have smooth and sharp 
claws. 

In selecting a goose, choose one with a clean 
white skin, plump breast and yellow feet. Char- 
coal is considered as an admirable preventive for 
decomposition. 

CMcken Patties — Cold chicken, milk, flour, 
pepper, salt and butter, puff paste. 

Mince cold chicken, and stir it into a white 
sauce, made of milk thickened with flour and 
flavored with pepper, salt and butter; line small 
patty pans with puff paste, bake first, and then 
fill with the mixture, and set in a hot oven for a 
few minutes to brown. 

Fowl (to Boil) — For boiling, choose those 
that are not black-legged. Pick them nicely, 
singe, wash and truss them. Flour them, and 
put them into boiling water. Serve with parsley 
and butter, oyster, lemon, liver or celery sauce. 

Fowls (Roast) — Butter, flour, gravy, lemon- 
juice, sausages, bacon. 

46 



Poultry and Game. 47 

Fowls require constant attention in dredging 
and basting, and the last ten minutes let butter 
rolled in flour be stuck over them in little bits, 
and allowed to melt without basting. The gravy 
for fowls should always be thickened, and slightly 
flavored with lemon juice. Sausages or rolled 
bacon should be served on the same dish, and 
white mashed potatoes should always be handed 
with poultry. 

Chicken Cutlets (with Rice) — A teaspoon- 
ful of rice, some good stock, 1 onion, salt and 
pepper, some cold ham and chicken, egg, bread- 
crumbs. 

Boil a teacupful of rice in some good stock, 
and pound it in a mortar with an onion that lias 
been cooked in butter, with salt and pepper. 
Pound separately in equal portions cold ham 
and chicken; form this into cutlets; cover them 
with egg and bread-crumbs and fry. Serve with 
a sharp sauce. 

Chicken a la Jardiniere — 2 young chickens, 
butter, 1 onion, some savory herbs, carrots, tur- 
nips, onions, beef stock, mushrooms, 2 cabbages, 
some heads of asparagus, pepper, sugar. 

Put two young chickens in a saucepan with 
some butter, a large onion chopped up, some 
savory herbs, some salt and sufficient water; the 
chickens should be dropped in the mixture when 
it is boiling, and left in the saucepan until the 
liquid is reduced by half; cut up in good shapes 
some carrots and turnips, some whole onions 
skinned and blanched, and put them in a sauce- 
pan with some butter, some beef stock, some 
mushrooms, two very young cabbages and some 
heads of asparagus; season with salt, pepper, and 
a little sugar; cook very gently, and fifteen min- 
utes before serving add a piece of butter kneaded 



48 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

with flour. Serve with vegetables well arranged 
around the dish. 

Chicken Rissoles — Some remnants of fowls, 
ham and tongue, butter, a pinch of flour, white 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, parslev, eggs, a few drops 
of lemon-juice, flour, water, 3 pinches of sugar. 

Mince very finely some remnants of fowls, free 
from skin, add an equal quantity of ham or 
tongue, as well as a small quantity of truffles, all 
finely minced; toss the whole in a saucepan with 
a piece of butter, mixed with a pinch of flour; 
add white pepper, salt, and nutmeg to taste, as 
well as a little minced parsley; stir in oflf the fire 
the yolks of one or two eggs beaten up with a few 
drops of lemon- juice, and lay the mixture on a 
plafe to cool. Make a paste with some flour, a 
little water, two eggs, a pinch of salt, and two or 
three of sugar; roll it out to the thickness of a 
penny piece, stamp it out in round pieces three 
inches in diameter; put a piece of the above 
mince on each, then fold them up, fastening the 
edges by moistening them with water. Trim the 
rissoles neatly with a fluted cutter, dip each one 
in beaten-up egg, and fry a golden color in hot 
lard. 

Chicken (Jellied) — A chicken, 1 oz.of butter, 
pepper and salt, 3^ packet of gelatine. 

Boil the chicken until the water is reduced to a 
pint; pick the meat from the bones in fair-sized 
pieces, removing all gristle, skin and bone. Skim 
the fat from the liquor, add an ounce of butter, 
a little pepper and salt, and half a packet of 
gelatine. Put the cut-up chicken into a mould, 
wet with cold water; when the gelatine has dis- 
solved pour the liquor hot over the chicken. 
Turn out when cold. 

Chicken Loaf — A chicken, 2 oz. of butter, 
pepper, salt, egg. 



Poultry and Game. 49 

Boil a chicken in as little water as possible 
nntil the meat can easily be picked from the 
bones; cut it up finely, then put it back into the 
saucepan with two ounces of butter, and a sea- 
soning of pepper and salt. Grease a square china 
mould and cover the bottom with slices of hard- 
boiled egg', pour in the chicken, place a weight 
on it, and set aside to cool, when it will turn out. 

Chicken Cro(Xuettes — Breast of a roast fowl, 
tongues, truffles, butter, flour, stock, parsley, 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, eggs, lemon-juice, parsley. 

The breast of a roast fowl, two parts; of boiled 
tongue, one part, and of truffles, one part; mince 
all these very finely, and mix them together. 
Melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, stir a little 
flour into it, then put in the above mixture, and 
moisten with a small quantity of stock; add some 
finely minced parsley, pepper, salt, and nutmeg 
to taste. Stir it on the fire for a few minutes, 
then stir in it, off the fire, the yolks of one or two 
eggs beaten up with the juice of a lemon and 
strained. Spread out this mince (which should 
be pretty stiff) on a marble slab, and when it is 
nearly cold fashion it into small portions in the 
shape of balls or of cones. Dip each in a beaten- 
up egg, and then roll it in very fine baked bread- 
crumbs; repeat this operation after the lapse of 
an hour, and after a similar interval fry the cro- 
quettes in hot lard to a golden color. Serve on 
a napkin, with plenty of fried parsley. 

Pressed Cliicken — Two chickens, boiled until 
the meat leaves the bones easily, then pull to 
pieces and chop fine, letting the liquor in which 
they were cooked boil down until only a cupful 
remains. Add about one-half as much chopped 
ham as chicken; roll two soda crackers, pour the 
stock over, seasoning highly. Mix well together, 
put in a deep, long pan, pressing down hard with 



50 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

the hand. Fold a cloth several times, put over 
the top, and put on a weight. It will slice nicely 
if prepared the day before using. 

Braised Chicken — Draw and prepare a 
chicken as for roasting. Truss it without filling 
and place in a baking-pan over 3^ of a small 
carrot and 1 onion, chopped fine, 4 cloves, 1 
sprig of parsley and a little salt and pepper. To 
this add 1 pint of rich meat stock, cover closely 
and bake in a quick oven for 1}^ hours. Then 
dish the fowl and place it where it will keep hot. 
Put one tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, 
let it brown and rub smooth in it one table- 
spoonful of flour; add to this the liquor in which 
the chicken was braised and then twelve mush- 
rooms, chopped fine. Stir this continually until 
it boils. 

Wild Duck (Roast) — Duck, bread-crumbs, 
carrot, pepper and salt, sage and onions, currant 
jelly, 1 pinch of cayenne, browned flour. 

Before roasting, parboil with a small carrot 
peeled and put inside. This will absorb the fishy 
taste. If you have no carrot at hand, an onion 
will have the same effect, but unless you mean to 
use onion in the stuffing a carrot is preferable. 
When parboiled, throw away the carrot or onion, 
lay in fresh water for half an hour, stuff with 
bread-crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt, sage 
and an onion, and roast till brown and tender, 
basting half the time with butter and water, then 
with drippings. Add to the gravy, when you 
have taken up the duck, one tablespoonful of 
currant jelly and a pinch of cayenne. Thicken 
gravy with browned flour and serve in a tureen. 

Quail Pie — Puff paste, salt pork or ham, 6 
eggs, butter, pepper, 1 bunch parsley, juice of 1 
lemon. 



Poultry and Game. 61 

Clean and dress the birds, loosen the joints, 
but do not divide them; put on the stove to 
simmer, while you prepare puff paste. Cover a 
deep dish with it, then lay in the bottom some 
shreds of pork or ham, then a layer of hard 
boiled eggs, a little butter and pepper. Take the 
birds from the fire, sprinkle with pepper and 
minced parsley. Squeeze lemon juice upon 
them, and upon the breasts of the birds a few 
pieces of butter rolled in flour. Cover with slices 
of egg, then shred some ham and lay upon this. 
Pour in a little of the gravy in which the quails 
were parboiled, and put on the lid. Leave a hole 
in the middle and bake a little over 1 hour. 

"Rabbit Pie — Two rabbits, J^ lb. fat pork, 4 
eggs, pepper, butter, a little powdered mace, a 
few drops of lemon juice, puff paste. 

Cut a pair of rabbits into ten pieces, soak in 
salt and water half an hour and simmer until 
half done, in enough water to cover them. Cut a 
quarter of a pound of pork into slices, and boil 
four eggs hard. Lay some pieces of pork in 
the bottom of the dish, the next a layer of rab- 
bit. Upon this spread slices of boiled egg and 
pepper and butter. Sprinkle, moreover, with a 
little powdered mace, a few drops of lemon juice 
upon each piece of meat. Proceed in this man- 
ner until the dish is full, the top layer being 
pork. Pour in water in which the rabbit was 
boiled; when you have salted it and added a few 
lumps of butter rolled in flour, cover with puff 
paste, make a hole in the middle and bake for 1 
hour. Cover with paper if it should boil too 
fast. 

Rabbit (Stewed) — One rabbit, dripping or 
butter, flour, 6 onions. 

Cut a rabbit in pieces, wash in cold water, a 
little salted. Prepare in a stewpan some flour 



62 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

and clarified dripping or butter; stir it until it 
browns. Then put in the pieces of rabbit, and 
keep stirring and turning until they are tinged 
with a little color; then add 6 onions, peeled but 
not cut up. Serve all together in a deep dish. 

A German Dish — A tender fowl, salt, pepper, 
mace, flour, yolk of 1 egg, hot lard, liver, gizzard, 
parsley. 

Quarter a tender fowl, season the pieces with 
pepper, salt and mace; flour, aud then dip them 
in the beaten-up yolk of an egg: fry a golden 
color in hot lard; dish them, garnished with the 
liver and gizzard fried separately, and with fried 
parsley. Serve either with a salad garnished 
with hard-boiled eggs or tomato sauce. 

(xiMets (to Stew) — Salt and pepper, butter, 
1 cup of cream, 1 teaspoonful of flour. 

Treat them as directed for giblet-pie (under 
the head "Pies"); season them with salt and 
pepper, and a very small piece of mace. Before 
serving give them one boil with a cup of cream, 
and a piece of butter rubbed in a teaspoonful of 
flour. 

Pig-eons — May be dressed in many ways. The 
flavor depends very much on their being cropped 
and drawn as soon as killed. No other bird re- 
quires so much washing. Pigeons left from din- 
ner the day before may be stewed or made into 
a pie; in either case care must be taken not to 
overdo them, which will make them stringy. 
They need only be heated up in gravy, made 
ready, and force-meat balls may be fried and 
added, instead of putting a stuffing into them. 
If for a pie, let beefsteaks be stewed in a little 
water, and put cold under them, and cover each 
pigeon with a piece of fat bacon, to keep them 
moist. Season as usual. 



Poultry and Game, 53 

Pig-eons (Roast) — Should be stuffed with 
parsley, either cut or whole, and seasoned within. 
Serve with parsley and butter. Peas or aspar- 
agus should be dressed to eat with them. 

Turkey (to Roast) — The sinews of the legs 
should be drawn, whichever way it is dressed. 
The head should be twisted under the wing; and 
in drawing it take care not to tear the liver, nor 
let the gall touch it. Put a stuflSng of sausage- 
meat, or, if sausages are to be served in the dish, 
a bread stufl&ng. As this makes a large addition 
to the size of the bird, observe that the heat of 
the fire is constantly to that part; for the breast 
is often not done enough. A little strip of paper 
should be put on the bone to hinder it from 
scorching while the other parts roast. Baste 
well and froth it up. Serve with gravy in the 
dish, and plenty of bread-sauce in a sauce-tureen. 
Add a few crumbs and a beaten egg to the stuf- 
fing of sausage-meat. 

Roast Turkey — Plain force-meat, 1 turkey, 
bacon, butter, salt, pork sausages, gravy. 

Pluck, singe, draw, wipe thoroughly and truss 
a fine turkey; stuff it with plain force-meat, pack 
it up in some thin slices of fat bacon, and over 
that a sheet of buttered paper; put in oven, bast- 
ing frequently with butter. A quarter of an 
hour before it is done, remove the paper and 
slices of bacon. Sprinkle with salt just before 
serving. Garnish with pork sausages, and serve 
with a tureen of gravy. Time of roasting, 2 or 
3 hours, according to size. 

Partridg-e — Dress 1 doz. nice partridges; put 
them in a baking-pan with 1 lb. good butter, a 
small teacupful vinegar, 1 teaspoonful water, 2 
pods red pepper, 3>2 teaspoonful ground black 
pepper, and salt to suit your taste. Put the pan 
into the stove, which must be hot enough to

cook them at once; ^ of an hour is generally 
sufficient. When the birds are brown all over, 
which they will be if you have basted them dili- 
gently as you turned them, set the pan on the 
top of the stove, pour in at once 1 quart of fresh 
sweet cream, adding ^^ teacupful of grated bis- 
cuit crumbs; stir well to keep from burning, 
and serve in a few minutes on a warm platter. 

To Cook Ducks — Prepare as many ducks as 
you wish for a meal and cut them up as you 
would to stew. Cover with cold water and let 
it come to a boil, then pour off the water, adding 
a fresh supply. Boil until tender, season with 
pepper and salt, then, pouring off the water, fry 
brown in butter. This is a splendid dish; the 
parboiling takes out all the wild taste which 
ducks usually have. Old prairie chickens may 
be treated in the same way. 

Roast CrOOSe — Prepare the goose the same as 
a chicken. Fill with potato or onion stuffing, 
being careful not to fill it too full, as this dress- 
ing will always swell in cooking. Place it in a 
baking-pan with 1 cupful of water and 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of salt. Bake in a quick oven, allow- 
ing 25 minutes for each pound, basting it fre- 
quently. When the goose has been roasting an 
hour, cool the oven and finish the roast at a 
moderate heat. Goslings may be cooked in the 
same manner, allowing 15 minutes to each pound. 

Potato Stiiifing for Geese or Ducks — Mix 

together 2 cupfuls hot mashed potatoes, 1 tea- 
spoonful salt, 1 teaspoonful onion juice, 4 table- 
spoonfuls of cream, I4 teaspoonful black pepper, 
1 tablespoonful chopped parsley, 1 tablespoon- 
ful butter and the yolks of 2 eggs. Beat until 
light.

Truffle and Chestnut Stuffing— One lb. fat 

bacon, 2 shallots, 1 lb. chestnuts, )4, lb. truffles, 
pepper, salt, spices, thyme, marjoram. 

Mince 1 lb. of fat bacon and a couple of shal- 
lots, give them a turn on the fire in a saucepan; 
then put in 1 lb. of chestnuts, boiled and peeled, 
and 3^ lb. of truffles, both cut up in moderate- 
sized pieces; add pepper, salt and spices to 
taste; also a little powdered thyme and mar- 
joram. Give the mixture another turn or two 
on the fire, and it is ready. 

Truffle Sauce — Rub a saucepan with a shallot, 
melt a piece of butter in it, add a very small 
quantity of flour and the trimmings of the truf- 
fles chopped coarsely; moisten with some good 
stock free from fat, and season with pepper, salt 
and the least piece of nutmeg. Let the sauce 
simmer about 10 minutes, and it is ready. 

To Boil a Turkey— Pick, singe, draw and 
wash it. Truss it by drawing the legs in under 
the skin; fasten them with a piece of tape round 
the joints, and tie it round the rump. Make a 
stuffing of bread-crumbs, pepper and salt, or of 
chopped oysters, and put it where the crop was 
taken out. Boil slowly for 2 hours, take off the 
tape, and serve with either oyster, celery or 
plain white sauce. 

Chestnut Sauce (for Koast Turkey) — Re- 
move the outer skin from a number of chestnuts 
(carefully excluding any that may be the least 
tainted), put them to boil in salted water with a 
handful of coriander seeds, and a couple of bay 
leaves. When thoroughly done, remove the outer 
skin, and pound the chestnuts in a mortar, add- 
ing a little stock (free from fat) now and then. 
When a smooth paste is obtained, fry an onion 
in butter to a light color, add the chestnut paste

and sufficient stock to get the sauce of the 
desired consistency; add salt and pepper to 
taste, pass through a hair sieve, and serve. 

Roast Haunch of Venison — Butter, salt, 
flour and water. 

Trim the joint neatly, wipe it well with a cloth, 
rub it over with butter, and sprinkle it with salt; 
then wrap it up in a sheet of buttered kitchen 
paper. Make a paste with flour and water, roll 
it out to the thickness of about half an inch, 
wrap the joint in this, and close up all the open- 
ings carefully by wetting the edges of the sheet 
of paste; lastly, pack up the haunch into a sheet 
of well buttered paper, put in the oven for about 
three hours, basting occasionally, then remove 
the paste and paper coverings, baste the haunch 
plentifully with butter, and when nearly done 
dredge some flour over it and some salt. Serve 
on a hot water dish. 

Breast of Venison (Stewed) — One onion, i 
carrot, a bundle of sweet herbs, a few cloves, 
pepper and salt, common stock, butter, 1 table- 
spoonful of flour, 1 squeeze of lemon. 

Remove the bones and skin, roll it up and tie 
it with a string in the shape of a round of beef, 
put it into a stewpan with an onion and carrot, 
sliced, a bundle of sweet herbs, a few cloves and 
pepper and salt to taste, add common stock 
sufiicient to come up to the piece of venison, 
cover up the stewpan and let the contents 
simmer gently for about three hours, turning 
the meat occasionally; when done strain as much 
of the liquor as will be wanted for sauce, into a 
saucepan containing a piece of butter, pre- 
viously melted and well mixed with a table- 
spoonful of flour, stir the sauce on the fire until 
it thickens, then add a squeeze of lemon; pour 
it over the meat in a dish and serve.

}4, cup of cream or rich milk in which an egg has 
been beaten, brown flour, one tablespoonful of 
wine, juice of half a lemon. 

Prepare to parboil for ten minutes. Lay in 
cold water for half an hour. Cut into joints, 
pepper, salt and flour them. Fry a light brown 
in some butter. Put them in a stewpan and 
cover with gravy made from the giblets, necks, 
and some pieces of veal. Add a minced shallot, 
bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper. Cover 
and stew for half an hour or until tender, take 
out the duck, skim the gravy and strain; add 
half a cup of cream, or some rich milk in which 
an egg has been beaten, thicken with brown 
flour, and add the juice of half a lemon. The 
lemon juice must be beaten in slowly, or the 
cream may curdle. Boil up and pour over the 
ducks and serve. 



MEATS 

IN purchasing beef secure meat of a deep red 
color, with the fat mingled with the lean, 
giving it a mottled appearance. The fat 
will be firm, and the color resembling grass 
butter. The smaller the breed, so much sweeter 
the meat. It will be better for eating, if kept a 
few days. Veal, lamb and pork (being white 
meat ) will not keep more than a day or two. 

Beef — For roasting, the sirloin and rib 
pieces are the best. The chief object is to pre- 
vent the escape of the juices, and if you are 
roasting in an oven, it is a very good plan to 
throw a cup of boiling water over the meat when 
it is first put in the oven. This will prevent the 
escape of the juices for a while, and will thor- 
oughly warm through the meat. 

Mutton — Choose this by the fineness of its 
grain, good color, and firm white fat. It is not 
the better for being young; if of a good breed 
and well-fed, it is better for age; but this only 
holds with wether-mutton; the flesh of the ewe 
is paler, and the texture finer. Eam-mutton is 
very strongly-flavored; the flesh is of a deep 
red, and the fat is sj)on gy. 

La:mb — Observe the neck of a fore-quarter ; 
if the vein is bluish it is fresh ; if it has a green 
or yellow cast it is stale. In the hind-quarter, 
if there is a faint smell under the kidney, and 
the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. If the 
eyes are sunken, the head is not fresh. Grass- 
lamb comes in season in April or May, and con- 
tinues till August. House-lamb may be had in 
great towns almost all the year, but is in high- 
est perfection in December and January.

Meats. 59 

Pork — Pinch the lean, and if young it will 
break. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot 
easily be impressed by the finger, it is old. A 
thin rind is a merit in all pork. When fresh, 
the flesh will be smooth and cool ; if clammy, it 
is tainted. What is called measly pork is very 
unwholesome, and may be known by the fat 
being full of kernels, which in good pork is 
never the case. Pork fed at still-houses does 
not answer for curing any way, the fat being 
spongy. Dairy-fed pork is the best. A sucking 
pig, to be eaten in perfection, should not be more 
than three weeks old, and should be dressed the 
same day it is kiUed. 

Veal — Veal should be perfectly white; if 
purchasing the loin, the fat enveloping the 
kidney should be white and firm. Veal will not 
keep so long as older meat, especially in hot or 
wet weather. Choose small and fat veal. It is 
in season from March to August. 

Beef-Steak Pudding— 3^ lb. of flour, 6 oz. of 
beef suet, 2}4, lbs. of rump or beefsteak, pepper

with your hands, sprinkling a little salt, then 
mix with water to a smooth paste; roll the paste 
to an eighth of an inch; line a quart pudding 
basin with the paste; cut the steak into thin 
slices, flour them, and season with pepper and 
salt; put the oysters and the liquor that is with 
them into a saucepan and bring it to the point 
of boiling; then remove from the fire, and strain 
the liquor into a basin; then cut off the beards 
and the hard parts, leaving only the soft, roll the 
slices of steak, filling the basin with the meat

and oysters; pour in the stock and liquor from 
the oysters. Cover with paste and boil three 
hours. 

N. B. — Be sure the water is boiling before put- 
ting the pudding in. 

Fillets of Beef (with Olives)— A piece of 
ramp steak, pepper, salt, olives, onions, flour, 
stock, sauce. 

Out a piece of rump steak into slices % of an 
inch thick, and trim them into shape. Melt 
plenty of butter in a baking-tin, lay the fillets 
of beef in this, and let them stand in a warm 
place for an hour or so; then sprinkle them with 
pepper and salt, and fry them in some very hot 
butter, turning them to let both sides color. 
Stone a quantity of olives and parboil them. 
Fry some onions a brown color in butter, add a 
little flour, and, when that is colored, as much 
stock as you want sauce, pepper, salt and spices 
to taste. Let the sauce boil, then strain it, add 
the olives, and serve when quite hot, with the 
fillets in a circle round them. 

Orenadins of Beef— Rump steak, lard, bacon 
fat, rich stock of gravy, onions, turnips, butter, 
flour, milk, pepper, salt and nutmeg. 

Cut some rump steak in slices a little more 
than half an inch thick, trim them all to the 
same size in the shape of cutlets, and lard them 
thickly on one side with fine lardoons of bacon 
fat. Lay them out, the larded side uppermost, 
into a flat pan, and put into it as much highly- 
flavored rich stock or gravy as will come up to 
the grenadins without covering them. Cover 
the pan and place it in the oven to braise gently 
for an hour. Then remove the cover, baste the 
grenadins with the gravy, and let them remain 
uncovered in the oven till the larding has taken 
color; they are then ready. Take equal quanti- 



Meats. 61 

ties of carrots and turnips cut into the shape of 
olives. Boil all these vegetables in salted water, 
then melt a piece of butter in a saucepan, add a 
tablespoonful of flour, stir in sufficient milk to 
make a sauce, add pepper, salt and a little 
grated nutmeg. Put all the vegetables into this 
sauce, of which there should be just enough to 
hold them together; toss them gently in it till 
quite hot. Dress them in the middle of a dish, 
round them dispose the grenadins in a circle, 
and, having removed the superfluous fat from 
their gravy, put this round the grenadins, and 
serve.

Hamburg Steak — This is a nice way to cook 
Hamburg steak: Chop fine 1 pound of round 
steak, add 2 small onions, chopped fine, and 
pepper and salt to taste. Flour your hands, take 
two tablespoonful of the mixture and make into 
small, flat cakes- Have a large lump of butter 
very hot in your frying-pan, drop in the cakes 
and fry brown on either side. Some people 
make a gravy by adding a couple teaspoonfuls of 
flour to the butter in the pan, stirring in half a 
pint of cold water, with salt and pepper, and 
letting it boil up. 

Hash — Put 1}/^ teacups of boiling water into 
a saucepan, and make a thin paste with a 
teaspoonful of flour and a tablespoonful of 
water. Stir and boil it for 3 minutes. Add 
half a teaspoonful of black pepper, rather more 
of salt, and 1 tablespoonful of butter. Chop cold 
beef into fine hash, removing all tough, gristly 
pieces; put the meat into a tin pan; pour over 
it the gravy above mentioned, and let it heat ten 
minutes or so, but not cook. If preferred, add 
equal quantity of chopped boiled potatoes, and 
if you have the gravy of yesterday's dinner, you 
may use it instead of the made gravy, and you 
will need less pepper and salt and butter. 

Beef Tongue — If it has been dried and 
smoked before it is dressed it should be soaked 
over night, but if only pickled, a few hours will 
be sufficient. Put it in a pot of cold water over 
a slow fire for an hour or two before it comes to 
a boil; then let it simmer gently for from three 
to four hours, according to its size; ascertain 
when it is done by probing it with a skewer. 
Take the skin off, and before serving surround 
the root with a paper frilL 

Jellied Tongue — Boil until done one large 
beef's tongue, saving a pint of the liquor; 



66 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

remove the skin, allow it to get perfectly cold 
and slice as for the table. In half a pint of water 
dissolve thoroughly two ounces of gelatine; care- 
fully take from a teacupful of browned veal 
gravy all the grease, stir in a small tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, one tablespoonful of burned sugar 
to color the jelly, and three tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, then the liquor in which the tongue was 
boiled; mix in well the dissolved gelatine, then a 
pint of boiling water; strain through a jelly bag. 
As soon as it begins to set, pour a little jelly into 
the bottom of the mould, add a layer of tongue, 
then more jelly, until it is full; set in a cold 
place. When wanted, dip the mould an instant 
into hot water, and turn the contents into a dish, 
which should be garnished with lettuce leaves, 
nasturtium flowers or sprigs of celery. 

PORK 

Pork Pie— 3^ lb. of lard, 1 lb. of pork (leg 
or loin), seasoning, 1 lb. of flour and an egg, % 
glass of cold water. 

Put the lard and water into rather a large sauce- 
pan; place upon the fire and allow to boil (take 
care it does not boil over, or it will catch fire). 
Cut the pork into pieces about an inch square; 
when the lard and water are quite boiling pour 
into the middle of the flour and mix with a 
spoon. When the paste is cool enough knead it 
well, it must be rather stiff; cut off a quarter of 
the paste, and the remainder mould into the 
shape of a basin, pressing it inside; shape it 
evenly all round, it should be about % inch in 
thickness; dip the pieces of pork in cold water, 
seasoning well with pepper and salt, then place 
in the mould of paste as closely as possible. If 
liked, a little chopped sage can be sprinkled over 
the pork; then take the rest of the paste, roll it. 



Meats. 67 

and cut to the size of the top of the mould, tak- 
ing care to have it the same size as the inside; 
break an egg and divide the yolk from the 
white; with a paste-brush dip into the white of 
egg and brush the edge of the paste; then place 
this on the top of the pie, pressing the edges 
well. Any trimmings of paste that are left cut 
into little leaves, dip into the white of egg, and 
stick them on top of the pie; then wet the pie 
all over with the yolk of the egg and bake for 
about 2 hours. 

Pork (Hashed) — Some remnants of cold roast 
pork, pepper and salt to taste, 2 onions, 2 blades 
of mace, 1 teaspoonful of flour, 1 teaspoonful of 
vinegar, 2 cloves, 3^ pint of gravy.

brown; then take the pork and cut it into thin 
slices, seasoning with pepper and salt to taste, 
and add these to the rest of the above ingre- 
dients; stew it for about half an hour gently, and 
serve with sippets of toasted bread. 

Sucking Pig (Roast)— Pig, 3 oz. of bread-

spoonful of butter, salad oil to baste with, table- 
spoonful of lemon juice, }4 pi^* of gravy. 

Stuff the pig with finely grated bread-crumbs, 
minced sage, pepper and salt, and a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Take care these are well blended. 
After stuffing the pig sew up the slit neatly, truss 
the legs back, to allow the inside to be roasted, 
put in oven, and directly it is dry have ready 
some butter tied in a piece of thin cloth, and 
rub the pig with this in every part. Continue 
this operation several times while roasting; do 
not allow the pig to burn in any part. Then 
take }4 pill* of gravy, 1 tables poonful of lemon 
juice, and the gravy that flowed from the pig; 
pour a little of this over the pig, and the re-

mainder send to the table in a tureen. Instead 
of butter for basting many cooks use salad oil, 
as this makes the crackling crisp. Before dish- 
ing cut off the head and part the body down the 
middle, and lay on the dish back to back. Take 
care that it is sent to table very hot, and serve 
with apple sauce. It will take about 2 hours for 
a small pig to roast. 

Pork Cheese — About 2 lbs, of cold roast pork,

of chopped suet, shallot, thyme, marjoram and 
winter savory, all chopped fine; 2 eggs, salt and 
pepper to season; mix all these ingredients into 
a firm, compact kind of paste, and use this stuff- 
ing to fill a hole or pocket which you will have 
cut with a knife in some part of the piece of 
veal, taking care to fasten it in with a skewer. 
A piece of veal weighing 4 lbs. would require ra- 
ther more than an hour to cook it thoroughly be- 
fore a small fire. 

Yeal (Stewed) — Two qts. of water, 1 peeled

free them from skin and gristle, lard them well, 
and season with salt and pepper. Have some 
eggs boiled hard and thin slices of ham. Make 
some forcemeat balls with fat bacon, the trim- 
mings of the veal, chopped onions, parsley and 
sweet herbs, grated lemon peel, salt, cayenne, 
and pounded mace. Pound all in a mortar, and 
bind with 1 or 2 eggs. Line a pie with good 



70 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

paste, and fill it with layers (not too close), first 
one of ham, then one of veal, of forcemeat balls, 
of the eggs (cut in halves), and so on; a few 
mushrooms may be added; put in some gravy; 
lastly, a layer of thin bacon, and cover all with 
tolerably thick crust, glaze. Bake for about 4 
hours in a moderate oven. Make a hole in the 
top, and insert some good savory jelly — made 
with an ox or calf's foot, knuckle of veal, and 
trimming of bacon and ham well flavored with 
onions, more herbs and lemon peel, and cleared 
with the whites of egg. Leave till quite cold, 
then it can be cut with a sharp knife into slices. 

Veal Pudding"— Slice boiled veal about }^ an 
inch in thickness; butter a pudding dish and 
have ready 2 cupfuls of boiled rice; put first a 
layer of rice, then one of meat; season to taste, 
and add, if you like, a little chopped sage. Beat 
1 egg into 1 cupful of milk; add a little salt and 
pour over the pudding; bake % of an hour. 

Teal Cake — One-half lb. veal cutlets, 1 rasher 
of ham, 2 hard-boiled eggs, a little veal stuffing, 
and 3^ oz. of gelatine. 

Cut the eggs into slices and arrange them at 
the bottom and sides of a pie-dish. Cut the 
veal and ham into rather small pieces; arrange 
them in layers, with a little stuffing and egg be- 
tween, and a small quantity of water, pepper 
and salt. Cover with a plain crust, in which 
make two holes. Bake very slowly for 2 hours. 
Before it is done have ready the gelatine dis- 
solved in 3^ teacupful of boiling water, with 
pepper and salt. Pour this into the holes in the 
crust. Shake it down well, to mix together. 
Turn out when cold.

veal. 



Meats. 71 

Some cold roasted veal, season with spice, beat 
in a mortar; skin a cold boiled tongue, cut up 
and pound it to a paste, adding to it nearly its 
weight of butter; put some of the veal into a pot, 
and strew in lumps of the pounded tongue; put 
in another layer of the veal and then more 
tongue; press it down and pour clarified butter 
on top; this cuts very prettily like veined 
marble. White meat of fowls may be used in- 
stead of veal. 

Veal Scallop — Pepper and salt, crackers, 
milk and gravy from meat, 2 eggs, butter. 

Chop some cold roast or stewed veal very fine;

buttered; season with pepper and salt; next have 
a layer of finely-powdered crackers; wet with a 
little milk or some of the gravy from the meat. 
Proceed until the dish is full; spread over all a 
thick layer of cracker-crumbs, seasoned with salt 
and wet into a paste with milk and 2 beaten 
eggs. Stick pieces of butter all over it, cover 
closely, and bake half an hour; then remove the 
cover and bake long enough to brown nicely. 
Do not get it too dry. 

Yeal Cutlets— Four lbs. of the best end of the 
neck of veal, 3^ teaspoonful of minced thyme, 
rind of a small lemon, 1 bunch of parsley, 1

lb. of bacon. 

To shape the cutlets, saw off the end of the rib 
bone, saw off the chine bone also, which lies at 
the back of the cutlets; then form the cutlets to 
a neat shape. Mince thyme and lemon rind and 
parsley as finely as possible; melt the butter, 
and add these ingredients to it; add also the egg, 
pepper and salt, and beat all up together; then 
rub very finely some crumbs of bread; dip each 



72 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

cutlet into the mixture, then cover with bread- 
crumbs; when the gridiron is perfectly warm 
arrange the cutlets upon it. Have the fire nice 
and bright, but do not allow them to cook too 
fast or the bread-crumbs will burn before the 
cutlets are cooked through; allow them to brown 
nicely on both sides; about 10 minutes will be 
the time. Serve on a wall of mashed potatoes in 
a circle; fill the center of dish with rolls of bacon 
and with a nice brown sauce. (See "Sauces.") 

For Rolls — Cut some neat slices of bacon, roll 
them up and run a skewer through each; place 
this in the oven for about 5 minutes, then re- 
move the skewer and arrange in center of dish.

use that left from roast. Mince very fine, add 
two eggs, 3^ cup of rolled crackers, salt and

form pieces the size of half an apple. Melt in 
a saucepan 1 or 2 ounces of butter, according to 
the quantity of meat to be hashed; amalgamate 
with it 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, then stir 
in 3^ pint, more or less, of white stock. Stir 
well, then add a few button mushrooms, white 
pepper and salt to taste, and let the sauce boil 
for 10 minutes. Put the saucepan by the side 
of the fire, and lay the pieces of calf's head in it; 
let them get hot slowly, but not boil. Just be- 
fore serving stir in off the fire the yolks of two 
eggs, beaten up with the juice of a lemon, and

pan; add a little stock, and baste it in the gravy 
till done, and keep turning the meat. Simmer 
4 pounds for 3 or 4 hours. 

MUTTON 

Mutton Cutlets — This is an entree always 
ready to hand, but it must be carefully and 
neatly prepared. A dish of well-dressed mutton 
cutlets is truly "a dish to put before a king;'' 
whereas greasy, fat, gristly meats, called for the 
nonce cutlets, offend the taste of the least fas- 
tidious. The first thing to attend to is the cut- 
ting and trimming of the cutlets neatly. Take 
a piece of the best end of the neck of mutton, 
saw off the bones short, remove gristle and fat, 
cut the cutlets about one-third of an inch in 
thickness, shape and trim them neatly, beat 
them with a cutlet bat dipped in water, and then 
proceed to cook them by any of the following 
recipes: 

Pepper, salt, and broil them over a brisk fire; 
serve them with mashed or sautee potatoes in 
the center of the dish. 

Season as above, and before broiling dip them 
in oil or oiled butter. Serve with —

mer gently until tender; take them out. drain 
them thoroughly, press through a sieve or 
tammy cloth, add 3^ pt. of bechamel sauce made 
thus: Put in a stewpan a little parsley, 1 clove, a 
small piece of bay leaf, sweet herbs, and 1 pt. of 
White stock freed from fat; when boiled long 
enough to extract the flavor of the herbs, etc., 
strain it, boil up quickly till reduced to half the 
quantity; mix a tablespoonful of arrowroot with 
^ pt. of milk or cream, pour on the reduced 
stock and simmer for 10 minutes. 

A Dainty Dish — For a dainty dish of cold 
meat, boil a leg of lamb in water enough to 
cover, to which add a handful of cloves and whole 
allspice and a stick or two of cinnamon. Let it 
stand in the water in which it was boiled to be- 
come cold. Slice very thin. Beef can be cooked 
in the same style. 

Mutton Pudding — 2 lbs. of the chump end 
of the loin, weighed after being boned; suet crust 
(proportions — 6 oz. of suet to each lb. of flour);

hours. 

Mutton (Boned Le^ of, Stuffed) — A leg 
weighing 7 or 8 pounds, 2 shallots, forcemeat. 

Make forcemeat, to which add the minced 
shallots. Get the butcher to take the bone from 
the mutton, as he can do it without spoiling the 
skin; if very fat, cut off some of it. Fill up the 
hole with the forcemeat, then sew it up to pre- 
vent it falling out, tie up neatly and roast about 
2}/£ hours or a little longer. When ready to serve, 
remove the string and serve with a good gravy.

Lamb Chops — A little butter, a little water, 
enough potatoes to fill a small dish, 1 teacupful 
of cream. 



76 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Lamb chops are excellent cooked this way: 
Put them in a frying-pan with a very little water, 
so little that it will boil away by the time the 
meat is tender; then put in lumps of butter with 
the meat and let it brown slowly; there will be a 
brown, crisp surface, with a fine flavor. Serve 
for breakfast with potatoes cooked thus: Choose 
the small ones and let them boil till they are 
tender; drain off the water, and pour over them, 
while still in the kettle, at least one teacupful of 
cream; mash them smoothly in this.

few peppercorns, till quite tender. Have ready 
a little good gravy, and some oysters stewed in 
it: thicken this with flour and butter, and pour

in a white gravy; add cream, flour, butter, nut- 
meg, salt and white pepper. Or do them in 
brown sauce seasoned. Or parboil them, and

ing, and brown them in a Dutch oven. Serve 
with butter and mushroom catsup or gravy. 
N. B. — If there is no oven at hand, they may be 
toasted before the fire upon a toasting fork. 

Fried Sweetbreads — After they are par- 
boiled and cold, split in halves and cut into 
pieces as large as very large oysters, wipe dry 



Meats. 77

crumbs; fry in hot lard or butter same as oysters; 
sprinkle with salt before dipping in egg. Serve 
hot; garnish with parsley. 

Sweetbreads (Larded) — A couple of sweet- 
breads, a few strips of bacon, onions, carrots, 
sweet herbs, pepper, salt, spice to taste, a small 
quantity of rich stock. 

Trim a couple of sweetbreads, soak them half 
an hour in tepid water, then parboil them for a 
few minutes, and lay them in cold water; when 
quite cold take them out, dry them, and lard 
them quickly with fine strips of bacon. Put a 
slice of fat bacon in a stewpan with some onions, 
carrots, a bunch of sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and 
spices to taste, and a small quantity of rich 
stock; lay the sweetbreads on this, and let them 
gently stew till quite done, basting the top occa- 
sionally with the liquor. When cooked, strain 
the liquor, skim off superfluous fat, reduce it 
almost to a glaze, brown the larded side of the 
sweetbreads with a salamander, and serve with 
sauce over them.

add the pepper, salt, and enough cold water to 
cover them, and stew very gently for an hour. 
Thicken with the flour a few minutes before 
done, and serve very hot. 



CURRIgS. 



MOST people have a liking for a really good 
curry ; but how very rarely it is to be 
obtained in America, unless at the house 
of some one who has passed a good many years 
in India. The dish miscalled a curry is fre- 
quently set before people, but too often as 
far as possible removed from the real and 
apj)etizing plat which a good Indian cook will 
send to table. The meat is tough, has most 
hkely been boiled instead of gently simmered, 
the sauce, or thick gravy, is hot enough in all 
conscience, but it tastes only of curry powder 
of an inferior kind; the rice is a slo23py mess, 
and the result is a fiery, leathery sort of 
indigestible hash, instead of a sweet, acid, 
highly but agreeably flavored, perfectly cooked 
and digestible dish, fit to set before a j)rince. 
Any cook, of whatever nationality, who has 
really mastered the art of stewing properly, 
that is, very gently and slowly, can cook a curry ; 
the real difficulties lie in procuring good curry 
powder or curry paste. 

Curry Powder — 1 lb. pale turmeric seed, ^ 
lb. cumin seed, }^ lb. black pepper, 3^ lb. 
coriander seed, 2 oz. cayenne pepper, 3^ lb. 
Jamaica ginger, 10 oz. caraway seed, ^4 ^'^• 
cardamines. 

Purchase the ingredients of a first-class drug- 
gist. Additional heat can be obtained, by those 
who like very hot curries, if red Chile powder be 
added according to taste. Mix together all the 
ingredients well powdered, and place before the 
fire or in the sun, stirring occasionally. Keep in 
well corked bottles.

ing, wash well and dry in a cloth, cut in pieces of 
equal size. After straining the butter from the 
onions, return the former to the stewpan, put in 
pieces of rabbit, and allow to fry for ten or 
fifteen minutes, turning occasionally. Peel and 
core the apple, and chop as finely as possible. 
When the meat is done add to it two tablespoon-

pieces; sprinkle curry powder over them, also a 
little salt, and just before putting in the sauce- 
pan pour a part of a cup of sweet cream over 
them. Let this all simmer gently for half an 
hour, so that the ingredients will become thor- 
oughly mixed.

spoonful of curry powder, and a small teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Put the butter, onions and appl(> 
into a stewpan, and fry till brown, then add the 
cauliflower and shrimps. Shake the saucepan 
frequently, and let it simmer for an hour and a 
half, adding the slices of mutton towards the end 
of the time, that they may be heated through* 
Finally, add the juice of a lemon. Place the 
slices of mutton round the dish with the cauli- 
flower, etc., in the middle. Serve very hot, with, 
a separate dish of boiled rice.

Curried Lobster — Lobster, cream, rice. 

Take the flesh of a lobster (or a tin of lobster 
does very well for this dish), make curry gravy 
with plenty of cream; pour into a saucepan with 
the lobster, warm it just to boiling point; serve 
with rice round. 

Boiled Kice for Curry — Put the rice on the 
stove in cold water, and allow it to come to a 
boil for a minute or two. Strain, dry and put in 
stewpan without lid at the back of the stove, to 
allow the steam to evaporate; shake into dish 
very hot; a few drops of lemon juice put in

hour. 



GRAVIES. 



GEAVY may be made quite as good of the 
skirts of beef, and the kidney, as of any 
other meat, prepared in the same way. 
An ox- kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut 
all to pieces, and prepared as other meat; and 
so will the shank end of mutton that has been 
dressed, if much be not wanted. 

The shank-bones of mutton are a great im- 
provement to the richness of gravy; but first 
soak them well, and scour them clean.

the neck to it; pass the gravy again through a 
strainer, add salt and pepper, heat it, and serve 
very' hot. 

Oravy for a Goose or Duck — Prepare in 

same way as for general use, with the addition 
of an onion and some sage. 



SAUGBS. 



THE appearance and preparation of sauces, 
are of the highest importance. Brown sau- 
ces should not be as thick as white ones, and 
should possess a decided character, so that, both 
whether sweet or sharp, plain or savory, they 
would bear out their names. Care is also to be 
taken that they blend and harmonize Avith the 
various dishes they are to accompany. 

White Sauce— One pint milk, 2 or 3 mush- 
rooms, 1 onion, 1 carrot, 1 bundle sweet herbs, 
whole pepper and salt to taste, a few cloves, a 
little mace, 1 oz. butter,, and 1 gill cream. 

Put into 1 pint milk 2 or 3 mushrooms, 1 
onion and a carrot cut into pieces, 1 bundle of 
sweet herbs, whole pepper and salt to taste, a 
few cloves and a little mace; let the whole gently 
simmer for about an hour; put 1 ounce of butter 
into a saucepan, and stir on the fire until it 
thickens. Finish by stirring in 1 gill cream. 

Horseradish Sauce— Two oz. horseradish, 6 
tablespoonfuls milk or cream, 3 dessertspoon- 
fuls vinegar, 1 teaspoonful sugar, 3^ do. pepper. 

Grate the horseradish, mix it with salt, sugar 
and pepper. Add the cream or milk very gradu- 
ally, and heat the whole over the fire, stirring 
weU all the time. If allowed to boil it will spoil. 
Serve with hot roast beef. 

Sauce for Wild Fowl — Half pint gravy, 1 
small onion, 3 or 4 leaves basil, a piece of the 
thin rind of a lemon, 1 dessertspoonful lemon 
juice. 

Boil the gravy, onion and basil together for a 
few minutes, strain, and add the lemon iuice.

them out into sprigs and arrange them, heads 
downward, in a pudding basin, which must have 
been made quite hot; press them in gently, then 
turn them out dexterously on a dish, and pour 
over them the following sauce, boiling hot: Melt 
13^ oz. butter in a saucepan, mix with it a table- 
spoonful of flour, and then add 3^ pint of boiling

ter and the yolks of 2 eggs. Place the saucepan 
on a slow fire, stir the contents continuously, and 
as fast as the butter melts add more, until 1 lb. is 
used. If the sauce becomes too thick at any 
time during the process, add a tablespoonful of 
cold water and continue stirring. Then put in 
pepper and salt to taste, and take great care not 
to let the sauce boil. When it is made — that is, 
when all the butter is used and the sauce is of 
the proper thickness — put the saucepan contain- 
ing it into another filled with warm (not boiling) 
water until the time of serving. 

Sweet Sauce — One tablespoonful flour, sugar 
or molasses, 1 oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful lemon 
juice.

4 tablespoonfuls water, then stir into it 3^ pint 
boiling water, sugar or molasses to taste; stir over 
the fire until the sauce boils, when, if allowed, an 
ounce of butter may be added, with a tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice. When sweetened with sugar, a 
little nutmeg or ground cinnamon may be used 



Sauces. 91 

instead of lemon juice, if preferred. A table- 
spoonful of raspberry jam or any fruit syrup 
may be used to flavor the sauce, and is generally 
much liked. 

Mayonnaise Dressing — Yolks of 2 hard- 
boiled eggs, mustard, vinegar, olive oil or butter. 

Take the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs and mash 
smooth with ^ teaspoonful mustard and 2 table- 
spoonfuls olive oil; then add slowly j4 teacup

to it in bulk. Fry till the onion assumes a light 
brown color, add 3^ pint common stock or water 
and a small quantity of vinegar, pepper and 
salt to taste, and some minced parsley; then stir 
the sauce into another saucepan, in which a 
tablespoonful of flour and a small piece of 
butter have been mixed, over the fire. Let the 
sauce boil up, and it is ready. 

A Cheap Brown Sauce — One pint brown 
stock, 1% oz. flour, 2 oz. butter, 4 mushrooms, 
salt and pepper. 

Put the butter into a stewpan and put it on 
the fire to melt; wash the mushrooms in cold 
water, cut off the stalks and peel them; when the 
butter is melted stir in the flour and mix to a 
smooth paste; then add the stock and mush- 
rooms, and stir the sauce smoothly until it boils 
and thickens; then remove the stewpan to the 
back of the stove and let it simmer gently for 8 
or 10 minutes; season with pepper and salt; be 
careful to skim off the butter as it rises to the 



liite Ribbon Cook Book. 

top of the sauce. Should the sauce be not 
brown enough, a teaspoonful of caramel might 
be stirred into it; strain and serve. 

Onion Sauce (Brown) — Two oz. butter, ra- 
ther more than 3^ pint of rich gravy, 6 large 
onions, pepper and salt. 

Put into your stewpan the onions, sliced, fry 
them of a light brown color, with 2 oz. of butter; 
keep them stirred well to prevent them turning 
black; as soon as they are of a nice color, pour 
over the gravy, and simmer gently until tender;

pint best brown vinegar, 2 oz. salt, 3^ oz. cloves, 
1 oz. allspice, 3^ lb. white sugar, 1 oz. garlic, ^ 
oz. black pepper, 3^ oz. cayenne pepper. 

Wipe the tomatoes clean, and boil or bake till 
soft; then strain and rub through a sieve that 
will retain the seeds and skins. Boil the juice for 
an hour, then add the above ingredients (all the 
spices must be ground). Boil all together for 
a sufficient time, which may be known by the 
absence of any watery particle, and by the whole 
becoming a smooth mass; 5 hours will generally 
suffice. Bottle without straining into perfectly 
dry bottles, and cork securely when cold. The 
garlic must be peeled. The proportions of spice 
may be varied according to taste. 

Oyster Sauce — Oysters, butter, flour, milk, 
blade of mace, bay leaf, pepper and salt, cayenne, 
a few drops of lemon juice. 

Parboil the oysters in their own liquor, beard 
them, and reserve all the liquor. Melt a piece of 
butter in a saucepan, add a little flour, the oyster 
liquor, and enough milk to make as much sauce 



Sawces. 93 

as is wanted. Put in a blade of mace and a bay- 
leaf tied together, pepper and salt to taste, and 
the least bit of cayenne. Let the sauce boil, add 
the oysters, and as soon as they are quite hot re- 
move the mace and bay leaf, stir in a few drops 
of lemon juice, and serve. 

Worcester Sauce— Two tablespoonfuls Indian 
soy, 2 ditto walnut catsup, 1 dessertspoonful of 
salt, 1 teaspoonful cayenne pepper, 1 nutmeg 
(sliced thin), 1 doz. cloves, % oz. root ginger 
pounded, a little lemon peel, a small head of 
garlic divided into cloves, 1 pint vinegar, 3 oz. 
lump sugar. 

Dissolve the sugar in a little of the vinegar 
over the fire, add the other ingredients; put all 
into a wide-necked bottle. It should stand for 
a month before using, and is better if shaken 
every day. At the end of the month pour off 
clear into bottles. 

Chestnut Sauce — Remove the outer shell 
from some fine chestnuts, scald them in boiling 
water, and remove the inner skin. Stew them in 
good white stock till quite tender, drain, and 
while hot press them through a sieve. Put the 
pulp into a saucepan, add a small piece of butter, 
a little sugar, pepper and salt. Stir over the fire 
till quite hot, but do not let it boil, and serve. 

Mushroom Sauce — Remove the stalks and 
gritty part from 1^ pint of mushrooms; wash, 
drain, and put them into % pint of well-flavored 
gravy, simmer them till quite tender, drain them, 
and keep them hot. Melt 1 oz. butter in a 
saucepan, add to it 1 oz. flour, stir over the 
fire till brown; pour in the gravy, stirring till it 
boils. Arrange the mushrooms in the center of 
the dish, the cutlets round them, and pour the 
sauce over.

Chile Sauce — One bn. ripe tomatoes, 2 doz. 
large onions; chop very fine and boil 1 hour; 
then add 1 pint salt, 2}£ quarts vinegar, 5 red

ground ginger and cinnamon, and 1 each of 
cloves and nutmeg. Boil steadily for about 2 
hours; bottle and seal tightly. 

Bread Sauce (for Poultry or Game)— Gib- 
lets, ^ lb. stale bread, 1 onion, 10 whole pep- 
pers, 1 blade mace, salt, 2 tablespoonfuls cream. 

Put the giblets into 1 pint water, add the 
onion, pepper, mace, salt. Allow it to simmer 
for 1 hour, then strain the liquor over the bread 
crumbs. Cover the stewpan and let it stand on 
the stove for 1 hour (do not allow it to boil), 
then beat the sauce up with a fork until it is nice 
and smooth. Allow it to boil 5 minutes, stirring 
well until it is thick, then add cream and serve 
hot. 

Caper Sauce — Two oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful 
flour, 1 pint stock, pepper and salt, Worcester 
sauce, capers. 

Put 2 oz. butter and 1 tablespoonful flour into 
a saucepan; stir the mixture on the fire until it 
acquires a brown color; add rather less than 1 
pint boiling stock, free from fat; season with 
pepper, salt and a little Worcester sauce. When 
the sauce boils throw in plenty of capers; let it 
boil once more, and it is ready. 

Sauce HoUandaise — Take a scant }4 cup 
good butter. Beat the butter to a cream and 
add the yolks of 3 eggs, beating them into the 
butter with the juice of 3^ lemon. Add 1 sliced 
onion, 6 peppercorns and 1 bay leaf. Set the 
bowl containing the sauce in a basin of boiling 
water and stir it continually for a few moments. 
Then add a little boiling stock with a little 
grated nutmeg and 1 teaspoonful of salt. Con- 



(Sauces. 95 

tinue stirring it for about 5 minutes longer, 
when it should be of the consistency of a custard 
and perfectly smooth. Strain it through a sieve, 
add 1 teaspoonful butter and serve. 

- Mint Sauce — Chop 1 bunch fresh mint fine, 
mix with 1 tablespoonful sngar, a pinch of salt 
and pepper, rub well together, and add 3^ cup 
vinegar, with a squeeze of lemon juice. 



STOCKS. 



Common Stock— Take all the bones of joints, 
etc., that are available, carcasses and bones of 
poultry and game (not high), chop them all into 
convenient pieces and put them into a saucepan 
together with any scraps of meat, cooked or un- 
cooked, resulting from remnants, the trimming 
of cutlets, etc. Add a couple of carrots, 1 onion, 
1 bunch parsley, 1 bay leaf, a small sprig thyme, 
and 1 marjoram; salt to taste, a small quantity 
of white pepper and allspice mixed, and 2 or 3 
cloves. Fill the saucepan with cold water until 
it covers the contents by 1 inch, and set it on 
the fire to boil slowly for about 4 hours; strain 
the liquor through a cloth into a basin and when 
cold, the cake of fat on the top being removed, 
the stock will be fit for use. 

Gravy Stock — Place a layer of slices of onion 
in a saucepan holding 1 gal., over this a layer of 
fat bacon, and over all about 2 lbs. shin of beef 
chopped in small pieces; 1 pint common stock, 
or even water, being poured on the whole, set the 
saucepan on the fire for 1 hour, until the liquor 
is almost evaporated — what is called reduced to 
a "glaze" — then add sufficient cold common 
stock or cold water to cover contents of the 
saucepan, and 2 or 3 carrots cut in slices, 1 leek, 
1 head celery (when in season), or some celery 
seed, 1 handful parsley, y^ clove garlic, 1 sprig 
marjoram and 1 of thyme, 1 bay leaf, 4 or 5 
cloves, white pepper and salt to taste. After 
boiling for about 3 hours strain off the liquor, 
and, being absolutely freed from fat, it is ready 
for use. 

Veal stock — Toss a couple of onions, sliced, 
and 1 lb. lean veal cut in pieces in a saucepan 
with some butter until they assume a light color, 
then add 3^ lb. ham chopped up small, and 

96 



stocks. 97 

moisten with 1 pint common stock cold and per- 
fectly free from fat. Let the liquor reduce 
almost to a "glaze" — then add 2 quarts cold 
common stock, 1 knuckle veal, or 2 calves' feet, 
a couple of carrots, head of celery, parsley, bay 
leaf, thyme, mace, pepper and salt, all in due 
proportion. After boiling 2 or 3 hours, strain 
free from fat. 



VEGETABLES. 

VEGETABLES should be carefully cleaned 
from insects, and nicely washed. Boil in 
plenty of water, and drain the moment 
they are done enough. If overboiled, they lose 
their beauty and crispness. To dress them with 
meat is wrong, except carrots with boiled beef. 
To boil vegetables green, be sure the water 
boils when you put them in. Make them boil 
very fast. Don't cover, but watch them ; and if 
the water has not slackened, you may be sure 
they are done when they begin to sink. Then 
take them out immediately. Hard water, especi- 
ally if chalybeate, sjDoils the color. To boil 
green in hard water, put a teaspoonful of salt 
or wormwood into the water when it boils, 
before the vegetables are put in. 

Te^etaMe Marrow (to Boil or Stew)— This 
excellent vegetable may be boiled as asparagus. 
When boiled, divide it lengthwise into two, and 
serve it on toast accompanied by melted butter; 
or when nearly boiled, divide it as above, and 
stew gently in gravy. Care should be taken to 
choose young ones not exceeding 6 in. in length. 

Spinach — Wash and pick your spinach very 
carefully; drop into boiling water and cook 15 
minutes. Drain thoroughly through a colander, 
then chop quite fine. Return to the stove, add 1 
tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt to taste; 
put in a vegetable dish and garnish with hard- 
boiled eggs. 

To Stew Celery — Wash, cut into neat slices, 
removing the green parts. Plunge into sufficient 
boiling water to cover it, adding salt in the pro- 
portion of a dessertspoonful to 2 qts. of water. 

98 



Vegetables. 99 

Stew until tender, serve in a dish with white 
sauce over. The celery may be stewed in stock 
if preferred. 

How to Serve Potatoes— A great deal of ignor- 
ance is often shown by excellent housekeepers in 
putting potatoes on the table. The usual prac- 
tice of bringing them up in a porcelain or deep 
dish, with a close-fitting cover, would utterly de- 
stroy the best potatoes in ten minutes, however 
carefully cooked. They should be placed in a 
wooden dish, or served in a porcelain dish with 
towels above and below to absorb the moisture. 

Potatoes (Stuffed) — Five medium-sized po- 
tatoes, 3^ oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful grated 
cheese, pepper, salt, and yolk of 1 egg. 

Bake the potatoes in their skins, and when 
done cut off a small slice from one end, scoop out 
the inside, and rub through a wire sieve. " Add 
to it 3^ an oz. butter, 1 tablespoonful grated 
cheese, pepper, salt, and the yolk of an egg. 
Mix well, refill the skins, fit on the slices which 
were cut off, and put into the oven again for 10 
minutes before serving. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes — Into a saucepan put a 
large lump of butter and a small onion finely 
chopped, and when the onion is fried to an am- 
ber color, throw in slices of cold boiled potatoes, 
which must be thoroughly stirred until they are 
turning brown; at this moment put in a spoon- 
ful of finely chopped parsley, and as soon as it 
is cooked, drain through a colander, so that the 
potatoes retain the moisture of the butter, and 
many particles of parsley. 

Potatoes (Saiitees an Beurre) — Cut with a 
vegetable cutter into small balls about the size of 
a marble; put them in a stewpan with plenty of 
butter and a good sprinkling of salt; keep the 



100 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

saucepan covered, and shake it occasionally un- 
til they are quite done, which will be in about an 
hour. 

Savory Potatoes — Peel as many potatoes as 
you require. Put them in a pie-dish with a good- 
sized onion chopped fine, )^ teaspoonful of 
dried sage powdered, 2 oz. butter and 2 table- 
spoonfuls olive oil, and enough water to cover 
the bottom, of the dish. Pepper and salt to 
taste, and bake in a slow oven. 

Saratoga Potatoes — Saratoga chips are pre- 
pared in thin, paper-like slices (a slaw-cutter is 
required for this), and crisped, but not burned, 
in hot fat. The secret of preparing them prop- 
erly lies in cutting them first in the thinnest 
slices possible, and soaking them for at least 1 
hour in cold salt water. The last process draws 
the starch out of the potato, and is positively 
necessary to success. Before frying, each piece 
must be thoroughly dried on a towel. When 
taken out of the fat they may be drained on a 
sieve a moment in a very hot oven or over the 
stove, then cooled quicMy in a draft. 

Potatoes (Yirg'ima Style)— Slice as for Sara- 
toga potatoes, but thicker, soak in cold water, 
drain, and fry in covered pan with 2 or 3 spoon- 
fuls of suet, turning brown before they are put 
in. Salt and pepper thickly while cooking at 
leisure. 

Potato Pancakes — Grate 8 large potatoes in a 
porcelain bowl, add 4 eggs, not beaten, 1 teacup 
flour, 3^ cup milk and 1 even teaspoonful bak- 
ing-powder ; stir all lightly together, taking care 
not to beat the eggs up too much. Fry the same 
as ordinary pancakes, but longer, to cook thor- 
oughly. 



Vegetables. 101 

Potatoes (a la Creme)— Slice the potatoes as 
for frying and soak in cold water i^ hour. Par- 
boil in a frying-pan, pour the water off and let 
them stand on the fire uncovered till the steam 
is driven off; brown 1 spoonful of butter or fat 
and pour over them a minute after; then cover 
the potatoes with milk, in which they should 
boil till done. Salt and pepper while cooking 
and watch lest they burn. There should be just 
milk enough when done for a creamy gravy, 
thickened by the starch of the potatoes. 

Fried Potatoes— American fried potatoes are 
boiled first and sliced cold to fry. They need a 
large frying-pan, or are best cooked on a grid- 
dle which has surface enough to let each piece 
lie next to the fire. Slice them }^ inch thick so 
as not to break in turning. Salt and pepper, 
and when the large spoonful of fat is turning 
brown in the hot pan lay them in, brown quickly 
and turn with a broad griddle-cake turner. 

Potatoes of secondary quality are best pared 
and sliced raw and fried. The heat of boiling 
fat, which is stronger than that of boiling water, 
drives the water out of them. Small, deep kettles 
are sold for frying, and the lard is kept in them 
and used many times over. 

Potato Balls — Four large, mealy potatoes, 
cold; mash them in a pan with 2 tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, a pinch of salt, a little pepper, 
1 tablespoonful of cream and the beaten yolk of 
1 egg] rub it together for about 5 minutes, or 
until very smooth; shape the mixture into balls 
about the size of a walnut or small rolls, dip 
them into an egg well beaten and then into the 
finest sifted bread crumbs; fry them in boiling 
lard. 

Potato Croquettes — Boil i dozen potatoes, 
strain and mash well; add 2 yolks of eggs, beat 



102 While Ribbon Cook Book. 

well and season. When cold, mould in the shape 
of long corks and dip each piece into beaten 
eggs; then roll in crumbs and fry a golden 
brown. 

Scalloped Potatoes — Cut 4 good-sized boiled 
or steamed potatoes into dice; put 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of butter in a frying-pan, and, when melted, 
add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour; mix until smooth; 
then add 1 pint of milk, and stir continually 
until it boils; add a teaspoonful of salt and 3 
dashes of black pepper; take from the fire. Put 
a layer of this sauce in the bottom of a baking- 
dish, then a layer of potatoes, then another layer 
of sauce, and so on until all is used, having the 
last layer sauce; sprinkle the top lightly with 
bread crumbs and put in the oven for 15 minutes 
to brown. Serve in the dish in which it was 
baked. 

Calbl)age(a la Caiilillower) — Cut the cabbage 
fine as for slaw; put it into a stewpan, cover 
with water and keep closely covered; when 
tender, drain off the water, put in a small piece 
of butter with a little salt, 3^ cup cream, or 1 cup 
milk. Leave on the stove a few minutes before 
serving. 

Parol (or Stiiflfed Cabbage)— Veal stuffing, 
slices of sausage meat, gravy. 

Cook the cabbage in salt and water sufficiently 
to open the leaves, and insert between them 
layers of ordinary veal stuffing and slices of 
sausage meat; then tie it securely round with 
thread to prevent the meat falling out. Replace 
in the stewpan and cook briskly at first, then 
simmer till completely tender. Serve in the 
same manner as ragout — that is to say, with a 
little gravy poured over the whole. 



Vegetables. 103 

Cabbage for Roast Meats —Take a medium- 
sized head of well-bleached cabbage and chop 
very fine. Put in a stew-kettle with just enough 
water to cook it tender, which will depend some- 
what upon the strength of the fire. Add salt to 
taste, and when it is cooked, if any water remains 
in the kettle, drain it off; then add a lump of 
butter the size of a small egg, a little white pep- 
per and enough milk to just about cover the 
cabbage. This is a very delicate way of prepar- 
ing this vegetable, and it goes nicely with roast 
meats. 

Stuffed Cucumbers — Boil large, firm cucum- 
bers until tender, scoop out the seeds and in 
their place put a filling made of fine bread 
crumbs, well-seasoned, and a little minced ham 
or veal. Fasten the cucumbers together with 
tapes and put in a baking-pan with a large cup- 
ful of water and a good-sized piece of butter; 
baste frequently and bake 3^ hour. A delicate 
and delicious dish. 

Aux Poinmes — One red cabbage, 3 or 4 mod- 
erate-sized apples, butter, salt, pepper, walnut, 
cloves, vinegar, red currant jelly, flour. 

Put a red cabbage into a saucepan, having 
previously washed it well; just cover it with 
water; peel, halve and core 3 or 4 moderate-sized 
apples and add them to the cabbage with a piece 
of butter about the size of a walnut, salt, pepper 
and 3 or 4 cloves. Cook very gently over a slow 
fire for 3 hours. When ready to be served, add 1

They may be eaten hot or cold. 

Tomatoes (StiiiFed) — Tomatoes, shallot, but- 
ter, bread crumbs, ham, parsley, sweet herbei, 
pepper, salt and toast. 

Dip some tomatoes in hot water, peel them, 
cut them in halves and remove the pips; rub a

the tomatoes in it, filling each half with the fol- 
lowing composition: Two parts bread crumbs, 
1 part ham finely minced, and, according to 
taste, parsley and sweet herbs also finely minced, 
and pepper and salt. Put a small piece of butter 
on each half tomato, and bake them 15 minutes.

lard very hot on the stove, drop the batter in, a 
spoonful at a time, and fry. 



Vegetables. 105 

Tomatoes (Broiled) — Large, fresh tomatoes, 
butter, pepper, salt, sugar, an eggspoonful of 
made mustard. 

In buying tomatoes for broiling, be careful to 
select large and fresh ones. Do not pare them. 
Slice in pieces about ^ inch thick and broil 
them for a few minutes upon a gridiron; while 
they are broiling, prepare some hot butter in a 
cup, seasoning with pepper, salt, an eggspoonful 
of made mustard and a little sugar; when the 
tomatoes are finished, dip each piece into this, 
and then dish (the dish must be hot). If any of 
the seasoning remains, heat to the point of boil- 
ing and pour over the dish; serve immediately. 
This is a very nice dish if cooked well. 

Onions (Boiled) — Skin them thoroughly. 
Put them to boil; when they have boiled a few 
minutes, pour off the water and add clean, cold 
water, and then set them to boil again. Pour 
this away and add more cold water, when they 
may boil till done. This will make them white 
and clear and very mild in flavor. After they 
are done, pour off all the water and dress with a 
little cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

Spanish Onions (a la Grecque)— Peel off the 
very outer skins and cut off the pointed ends; 
put the onions in a deep dish, and put a piece of 
butter and a little salt and pepper on the place 
where the point has been cut off, cover with a 
plate or dish, and let them bake for not less than 
3 hours. They will throw out a delicious gravy. 

Peas and Carrots— Take 5 or 6 good-sized 
carrots, scrape, cut into small dice and soak for 
1 hour in cold water, then boil for 1^ hours 
in three times enough water to cover them, 
with salt to season well. When thoroughly 
cooked, drain off the water and add 1 can of 
peas, well drained, and 1 cup of milk, and place 



106 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

on the stove again. Mix a heaping teaspoonful 
flour with a good heaping teaspoonful butter, 
and add when the milk boils up. Cook for a few 
moments, adding salt to taste, and a good shake 
of pepper. 

Onions (Stuffed) — Very large Spanish onions, 
cold fat pork or bacon, bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt, mace, cream, 1 egg, butter, juice of )^ 
lemon, browned flour, milk. 

Wash and skin the onions. Lay in cold water 
1 hour. Parboil in boiling water ^ hour. Drain, 
and while hot extract their hearts, taking care 
not to break the outside layers. Chop the inside 
thus obtained very fine, with a little cold fat 
pork or bacon. Add bread crumbs, pepper, salt, 
mace, and wet with 1 or 2 spoonfuls cream or 
milk. Bind with a well-beaten egg, and work 
into a smooth paste. Stuff the onions with this; 
put into a dripping-pan with a very little hot 
water, and simmer in the oven for 1 hour, bast- 
ing often with butter melted. When done, take 
the onions up carefully, and arrange the open 
ends upwards in a vegetable dish. Add to the 
gravy in the dripping-pan the juice of 3^ lemon, 
4 tablespoonfuls cream or milk, and a little 
browned flour wet with cold milk. Boil up once, 
and pour over the onions. 

Muslirooms — The cook should be well ac- 
quainted with the different sort of things called 
by this name by ignorant people, as the deaths 
of many persons have been caused by carelessly 
using the poisonous kinds. The eatable mush- 
rooms first appear very small and of a round 
form on a very small stalk. They grow very 
fast, and the upper part and stalk are white. As 
the size increases the under part gradually opens 
and shows a fringy fur of a very fine salmon 
color which continues more or less till the mush- 



Vegetables. 107 

room has been picked, when it turns to a brown. 
The skin can be more easily peeled from the real 
mushroom than the poisonous kind. A good 
test is to sprinkle a little salt on the spongy part 
or gills of the sample to be tried; if they turn 
black they are wholesome, if yellow they are 
poisonous. Give the salt a little time to act be- 
fore you decide as to their quality. 

Mushrooms (Stewed) — Gather those that 
have red gills; cut off that part of the stem 
which grew in the earth; wash, and take the skin 
from the top; put them in a stewpan with some 
salt; stew them till tender; thicken with 1 spoon- 
ful butter and browned flour. 

Mushrooms (Broiled) — PrejDare them as 
directed for stewing. Broil them on a griddle; 
and when done, sprinkle salt and pepper on the 
gills, and put a little butter on them. 

Mushrooms (Baked) — Pare the top and cut 

off part of the stalk, wipe them carefully with a 
piece of flannel or cloth and a little fine salt. 
Then put them into a baking-dish and put a 
piece of butter an each mushroom. Sprinkle 
with pepper to taste and bake for 20 minutes or 
'^ hour. When done serve on a hot dish with 
the gravy poured over the mushrooms. 

Mushrooms (a la Creme) — Cut the mush- 
rooms in pieces, and toss them over a brisk fire 
in butter seasoned with salt, a very little nut- 
meg, and 1 bunch herbs. When they are done 
enough, and the butter nearly all wasted away, 
take out the herbs, add the yolk of 1 egg beaten 
up in some good cream; make very hot and 
serve. 

Parsnips — Boil, mash, season with butter, 
pepper and salt, make into little cakes: roll in 
flour and brown in hot lard.

spoonfuls salad oil. This is a nice accompani- 
ment to boiled salmon, and is useful in concoct- 
ing a salad. It is also an excellent garnish for 
lobster salad. 

Cucumbers (Stewed) — Three large cucum- 
bers, a little butter, ]^ pint brown gravy, a little 
flour. 

Cut the cucumbers lengthwise, removing the

boiling water with a little salt. Allow it to sim- 
mer for 5 minutes. Put the gravy into another 
saucepan, and when the cucumbers are done, re- 
move from the water and place in the gravy, and 
allow to boil until they are tender. If there

move the seeds, quarter, and lay in ice water 10 
minutes; put into boiling water, a little salt, and 
cook until tender; press all the water from them. 
Mash smooth, season with butter and pepper 
and serve not. 

Winter Squasll — Proceed as above, allowing 
more time to cook; before putting into the boil- 
ing water, allow it to soak in cold water 3 hours. 

Cauliflower (Boiled) — Wash in 2 or 3 waters. 
Cut off the end of stalk and outer leaves, allow 
to lie in salt and water 5 minutes, plunge into 
boiling salted water, and boil 15 or 20 minates; 
drain and serve hot. 

Cauliflower (Fried) — Pick out all the green 
leaves from a cauliflower, and cut off the stalk 
close; put it head downward in a saucepan full 
of boiling salted water; do not overboil it; drain 
it on a sieve, pick it out into small sprigs, and

has lain about an hour in this drain it, dip in 
batter, and fry in hot lard to a golden color. 

Cauliflower (Scalloped) — Choose a cauli- 
flower of medium size, boil it 20 minutes; put 
into a saucepan 1 oz. butter, % gill milk, and 1 
oz. bread crumbs; add cayenne and salt to taste,

Vegetables. 113 

but be sure that it does not simmer after the egg 
has been added. Butter a flat tin dish, take off 
the fine leaves of the cauliflower and place them 
all round on it, break up the flower carefully and 
lay in the center, making it as high as possible; 
pour the sauce over this, sprinkle a few bread- 
crumbs on the top, and bake 10 minutes. 

Oreeii Peas (to Keep) — Shell, and put them 
into a kettle of water when it boils; give them 
2 or 3 warmings only, and pour them in a col- 
ander; when the water drains off, turn them out 
on a table covered with cloth, and pour them on 
another cloth to dry perfectly; then bottle them 
in wide-mouthed bottles, leaving only room to 
pour clarified mutton-suet upon them an inch 
thick, and for the cork. Resin it down, and keep 
it in the cellar or in the earth. When they are to 
be used, boil them till tender, with a piece of 
butter, a spoonful of sugar, and a little mint. 

Green Peas (Stewed) — Put a quart of peas, 
a lettuce and an onion, both sliced, a piece of 
butter, pepper, salt, and no more water than 
hangs round the lettuce from washing; stew them 
2 hours very gently. When to be served, beat 
up an egg and stir it in, or a little flour and 
butter. Some think a teaspoonful of white 
powdered sugar is an improvement. 

Green Peas (a la Francaise) — Put the 

required quantity of peas necessary for your 
dish into a perfectly clean and bright stewpan, 
with some water and butter in the following pro- 
portions: For every pint of peas 1 gill water and 
1 oz. butter. When this is thoroughly amalgam- 
ated, add a little bouquet, tied together, of 
parsley, also salt, pepper, and another 3^ oz. 
butter, then 8 or 9 small white onions, and a 
whole lettuce. Simmer the whole well for an 
hour, or more if the peas and other vegetables 



114 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

are not completely tender. The time, in fact, 
must be regulated according to the judgment of 
the cook. When done, take out the bunch of 
parsley, the lettuce, and the onions, which are 
very serviceable for hashes, stews or soups, even 
when used as above. The peas, when once cook- 
ing, must not be touched by a spoon or a fork, 
as it would bruise them and spoil the appearance 
of the entree, but well tossed constantly to pre- 
vent them sticking to the stewpan, always kept 
briskly simmering, but never boiling; otherwise 
they will harden. 

Baked Beans — Beans should be carefully 
looked over, thoroughly washed and pmt to soak 
over night in about twice their bulk of water. 
Put them in the kettle soon after breakfast the 
next morning, add about as much water as at 
first, place them where they will not burn, and 
let them cook slowly and without stirring until 
about ten o'clock. Then add half a pound of 
salt pork thoroughly washed and cut across the 
rind in small dice. Place the pork on the top of 
the beans and let it boil for an hour or more. 
Then lift the meat out, turn the beans and liquor 
into a baking-pan, press the water down until 
only the rind is out of the pork, and bake in a 
slow oven for several hours. 

Asparag'US — After scraping the stalks to 
cleanse them, place them in a vessel of cold 
water. Tie them up neatly into bundles of about 
25 heads each, then place them in a saucepan of 
boiling water, sprinkling a handful of salt over 
it. When it is boiling remove any scum there 
may be; the stalks will be tender when they are 
done; they will take about twenty minutes or 
half an hour; be careful to take them up the 
minute they are done; have ready some toast, 
dip it in the liquor in which the asparagus was 



Vegetables. 116 

boiled; dish upon toast, and serve with a boat of 
melted butter. 

Asparagus in Amlbush — Two bunches of 
asparagus, 8 stale biscuits (or rolls may be used), 
4 eggs, about ^^ pi^^ of milk, butter the size of 
an egg, flour, pepper and salt to taste. 

Take the green tops of the two bunches of aspa- 
ragus, boil them tender and mince finely. While 
they are boiling, take the biscuits or rolls, divide 
them, keeping the top half for a cover; place 
them all in the oven to crisp: make the milk 
hot, and then pour in the eggs, beaten; stir over 
the fire until it thickens, then add the butter 
rolled in flour, and lastly add the asparagus; 
spread the rolls with this mixture, put on the 
tops and serve hot. 

Asparag-iis and Eggs — Twenty-five or 30 
heads of asparagus, good rich butter, salt and 
pepper, 5 or 6 eggs.

a cup of rich butter and put it into a saucepan; 
drain the asparagus, and put it with the butter; 
heat them to a boil, seasoning with pepper and 
salt, and then pour into a buttered baking-tin or 
dish; break five or six eggs neatly over the sur- 
face of this, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and 
put it in the oven until the eggs are set nicely. 
Serve hot. 

Asparagus Pudding —Green tops of 2 bunches 
of asparagus, 3 tablespoonfuls of prepared flour, 
4 or 5 well-beaten eggs, 2 dessertspoonfuls of 
melted butter, 1 teacup of milk, 1 pinch of soda, 
pepper and salt to taste. 

Boil the asparagus and when cool chop finely; 
take the eggs, butter, pepper and salt, and beat 
them up together, then put in the flour; stir the 
soda into the milk, and add gradually; lastly put 



116 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

in the asparagus. Put this into a buttered mould

with a floured cloth; boil for two hours. When 
done, turn out on a dish, and pour melted butter 
round it. 

Artichokes, with White Sauce — Wash them 
well, peel and shape them to a uniform size; 
throw them into boiling salted water, and let 
them boil fifteen to twenty minutes; drain them 
at once thoroughly; put them on a dish and serve 
with the following sauce poured over them: Mix 
over the fire 13^ oz. butter with a tablespoonful 
of flour; add 3^ pint of boiling water, white

grated nutmeg. 

Artichokes, with Oravy — Prepare them as 
above, cutting them to the size of pigeon's eggs. 
Parboil them for ten minutes, drain them and 
toss them in a saucepan with a piece of butter; 
then add a small quantity of good clear gravy 
and a dust of pepper. Let them simmer very 
gently till wanted. 

Artichokes (Mashed) — Salted water, a piece 
of butter, a little cream, white pepper, nutmeg

a saucepan, and work it on the fire, with a piece 



Vegetables. 117 

of butter and a little cream, adding white pepper, 
nutmeg and salt if necessary. When quite hot 
and suificiently dry, serve. 

Artichokes (Fried) — Wash, peel and parboil 
them whole for ten minutes, then cut them in

Artichokes (Stewed) — Mince a couple of 
shallots and fry them in plenty of butter; put in 
the artichokes parboiled and cut into pieces, 
moisten with a little stock, season with pepper, 
salt, and a little lemon juice; lastly add some 
finely-chopped parsley, and let the whole stew 
gently till quite done. A small quantity of Par- 
mesan cheese may be added. 

Artichokes, au Gratiii — Wash, peel and boil 

them whole; cut them in slices the thickness of a 
cent. Butter a dish previously rubbed with a 
shallot; arrange the slices on it, strew over them 
some baked bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper, 
salt and a little powdered thyme, add a squeeze 
of lemon, put a few pieces of butter on the top, 
and bake for ten or fifteen minutes. 

Pumpkin (Stewed) — Halve, remove the seed, 
pare and slice neatly. Soak for an hour in cold 
■v^ater; then place in a saucepan of boiling water 
on the fire. Allow it to stew gently until it falls 
to pieces. Stir often. Then take it out, drain, 
squeeze, and rub through a colander, then put it

fuls of butter, pepper and salt to taste. Stir 
quickly, and when nearly boiling dish, adding 
more pepper if required. 

Pumpkin (Baked) — Cut the pumpkin into 
quarters; remove seeds, cut into slices length- 
wise about half an inch thick. Place in a baking- 



118 WJiite Ribbon Cook Book. 

dish suitable for the purpose and arrange in 
layers about three slices deep. Put a very little 
water in the bottom of the dish and bake very 
slowly until done (the watei must have evapor- 
ated). It takes a long time to bake. Butter the 
slices on both sides and dish. 



SALADS. 

ANY cold vegetable can be made into salad. 
I wonder that any one eats asparagus 
hot, it is so good cold. Scrape it thor- 
oughly, boil till soft (about thirty -five minutes), 
lay away carefully till cold, then make French 
or mayonnaise dressing and pour over. 

In making tomato salad scald the tomatoes 
first, then plunge in cold water, and the skins 
will come off easily. Set on the ice till cold, 
slice with a sharp knife, set the slices back 
upon each other so that each tomato shall re- 
tain its shape. 

Avoid breaking the lettuce leaves, and see 
that they are perfectly drained. Arrange the 
lettuce prettily in a glass dish, and set the veg- 
etable that accompanies it in the center. Never 
add the dressing till it comes to the table. 

Sliced bananas or oranges with lettuce and 
mayonnaise dressing are delicious. The former 
are, however, a trifle rich for any one whose 
digestion is only moderately reliable. 

In making cucumber salad, if the cucumbers 
are quite young, cut up one with the rind on. 
The peculiar slight bitter taste is very welcome 
to the palate of an epicure. Cucumbers should 
always lie in very salt ice water for a while to 
make them crisp and should not be seasoned 
until the last minute. Flabby cucumbers are 
as mean as cold batter-cakes. 

Lettuce Salad (1) — Take 4 or 5 heads of cab- 
bage lettuce, remove all outside leaves and cut 
off the stalks close; then cut each head apart into 
4 or 5 "quarters," that is, cut through the stalk 
and then tear the rest. Put 4 tablespoonfuls 

119 



120 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

olive oil into the salad bowl, with 2}^ table- 
spoonfuls tarragon vinegar, pepper and salt ac- 
cording to taste, and beat the mixture with a 
fork some minutes; then put in the lettuce and 
keep it turning over swiftly for 5 minutes, adding 
a small pinch of mint, chopped as finely as pos- 
sible. 

Lettuce Salad (2) — Wash 2 heads lettuce, dry 
them thoroughly and break the leaves or cut 
them into convenient pieces. Put the yolks of 
2 hard-boiled eggs into a basin with a teaspoon- 
ful of French mustard, pepper and salt to taste, 
and a tablespoonful of oil; work the mixture 
into a smooth paste, and add consecutively 3 
tablespoonfuls of oil,l of tarragon and 1 of plain 
vinegar; then a little chervil, garden cress and 
tarragon finely chopped. Stir the mixture well, 
and lastly add the lettuce; turn it or work it 
well. Garnish the top with hard-boiled eggs. 

Herring Salad — Heat through by turning on 
the stove 3 well-smoked herring, then tear off the 
heads and pull the skin away; split, take out the 
backbones, and cut up into small bits, or to shred 
them is better. Put in a salad bowl, add 1 small 
chopped onion, 2 hard-boiled chopped eggs, and 
1 boiled potato; cut fine with a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley; season with a teaspoonful of 
salt, 1 of pepper, 3 tablespoonfuls vinegar and 2 
of oil. Mix well, and, if you have it, decorate 
with a boiled beet. 

Potato Salad -Slice 8 cold boiled potatoes; dis- 
pose between the slices 1 silver-skinned onion cut 
quite fine; beat together 3 parts oil and 1 part, 
more or less, according to the strength of it, tar- 
ragon vinegar, with pepper and salt to taste. 
Pour this over the potatoes, and strew over all a 
small quantity of any of the following : Powdered 



Salads. 121 

sweet herbs, mint, parsley, chervil, tarragon or 
capers, or a combination of them all, finely 
minced. 

Cold Slaw — To 1 quart cut cabbage, use ^ 
cupful cream (either sweet or sour), 2 table- 
spoonfuls vinegar, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoonful salt, 1 
tablespoonful butter and a little pepper; put the 
vinegar on to boil, add the beaten eggs to the 
cream and butter, and stir these into the boiling 
vinegar till the butter is melted and the whole 
mass smooth and creamy; add the pepper and 
salt and pour, while hot, over the cabbage; when 
cold, it is ready for use. 

Lobster Salad — Clean thoroughly some let- 
tuce, endives and beetroots, cut them up and 
mix them with the following dressing: 4 table- 
spoonfuls oil, 2 tablespoonfuls vinegar, 1 tea- 
spoonful made mustard, the yolks of 2 eggs, 3^ 
teaspoonful anchovy sauce, and cayenne and 
salt. Pick out from the shells the flesh of 1 hen 
lobster, cut into well-shaped pieces, put ^ in 
the salad and garnish with the rest, also with the 
whites of 2 hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and 
the yolks mixed with the coral and rubbed 
through a sieve. 

Sardine Salad — Allow 3 sardines for each 
person; bone and fillet these, carefully removing 
all the skin, and set them aside until required. 
Boil 2 eggs for 3 minutes; shell them and break 
them up in your salad bowl with a spoon; mix 
with them a teaspoonful each French mustard 
and essence of anchovies, the strained oil from 
the tin of sardines with as much Lucca oil as 
will make 3 tablespoonfuls in all; add Chile, 
shallot, and good malt vinegar to taste (vinegar 
varies so much in acidity that it is difficult to 
specify the exact proportion). Cut up some 
nice crisp lettuce, and mix it well with the dress- 



122 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

ing, but only just before it is to be served. Put 
a little heap of mustard and cress in the center 
of the salad, with a whole red capsicum upon it. 
Arrange the sardines round, and outside these a 
border of mustard and cress, dotted here and 
there with thin slices of red capsicums. 

Cabbage Salad — Chop fine 1 firm head cab- 
bage, sprinkle lightly in a dish. Make the 
dressing as follows: Stir together 2 raw eggs, 1 
teaspoonful white pepper, 1 teaspoonf ul mustard, 
a little salt, 2 teaspoonfuls melted butter and 1 
cupful strong vinegar. Put this mixture in a 
small vessel set inside of another full of boiling 
water and stir 5 minutes; set aside to cool, then 
beat in 3^ cup cream, pour over the cabbage and 
serve. 

Tomato Salad — Peel some good-sized toma- 
toes, not over-ripe, cut them in slices and remove 
the pips, lay them in a dish with oil and vinegar 
in the proportion of 2 to 1, sprinkle pepper and 
salt over them according to taste, a few leaves 
basil finely minced, and some onions very finely 
sliced. They should lie in the sauce for a couple 
of hours before serving. 

Egg" Salad — Boil 3^ dozen eggs until hard, 
shell them and cut them into slices and pour 
over them, while hot, the following dressing: 
Put in a soup plate 3^ teaspoonful salt and }^ 
teaspoonful black pepper, add 3 tablespoonfuls 
olive oil and stir until the salt is dissolved. Stir 
in 1 tablespoonful tarragon vinegar, 1 table- 
spoonful onion juice and 1 tablespoonful chop- 
ped parsley. Stand away in a cold place for 2 
hours, and serve. 

Chicken Salad — Draw, singe and boil the 
chicken. When done and perfectly cold remove 
the skin and cut the meat into dice. If you want 
it very nice, use only the white meat; save the 



Salads. 123 

dark for croquettes. After you have cut it set it 
away in a cold place until wanted. Wash and 
cut the white parts of celery into pieces about a 
half inch long, throw them into a bowl of cold 
water and also set them away until wanted. To 
every pint of chicken allow two-thirds of a pint 
of celery and a cup and a half of mayonnaise 
dressing. When ready to serve, dry the celery and 
mix with the chicken; dust lightly with salt, white 
pepper or cayenne, then mix with it the mayon- 
naise. Serve on a cold dish garnished with white 
celery tips. One cup of white cream may be 
added to every 3^ pint of mayonnaise when ready 
to use it. It makes the dressing lighter, with less 
of the oily flavor. 

Celery Salad — Two heads of celery, 1 table- 
spoonful salad oil, % teacup vinegar, a tea- 
spoonful granulated sugar, pepper and salt to 
taste. 

Well wash the celery, removing any unsightly 
parts, lay in iced water until wanted; then cut 
into pieces about an inch in length. Season with 
remaining ingredients, mix well and serve in 
salad bowl. 

Red Cabbage Salad — One small red cabbage, 
1 small dessertspoonful salt, ^4 pint vinegar, 1}^ 
dessertspoonfuls oil. a little cayenne pepper. 

Secure a nice fresh cabbage, remove the outer 
leaves and cut the cabbage into nice thin slices, 
then mix in the above ingredients and allow 
to stand for two days, when it will be fit for use. 
This salad will keep good for several days. 

Rev. Sidney Smith's Recipe for Salad 
Dressing. 

" Two boiled potatoes, strained through a 
kitchen sieve. 
Softness and smoothness to the salad give; 
Of mordant mustard take a single spoon — 



124 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Distrust the condiment that bites too soon, 
Yet deem it not, thou man of taste, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt; 
Four times the spoon with oil of Lucca crown, 
And twice with vinegar procured from town; 
True taste requires it, and your poet begs 
The pounded yellow of two well boiled eggs. 
Let onions' atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, scarce suspected, animate the whole; 
And, lastly, in the flavored compound toss 
A magic spoonful of anchovy sauce. 
Oh! great and glorious, and herbaceous treat, 
'T would tempt the dying anchorite to eat; 
Back to the world he'd turn his weary soul, 
And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl." 

Boiled Salad Dressing* — Put 3^ pint of 
milk in a double boiler, and when it boils stir in 
2 tablespoonfuls corn starch moistened with a 
little cold water. Stir until it boils and thickens, 
then add the yolks of 3 eggs, well beaten; stir a 
minute longer, take it from the fire and add a 
tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, 
and stir in by degrees 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 
Stand it aside to get cold, and it is ready to use. 

French Dressing — Half teaspoonful salt, the 
same of pepper, mixed with 1 tablespoonful 
vinegar or lemon juice; add 3 tablespoonfuls 
oil; heat together briskly and pour over the 
salad; before putting on the different plates toss 
and turn the salad so that it may mix well. 

Mayonnaise Dressing— The yolks of 2 well- 
beaten eggs, 1 teaspoonful each of sugar and 
salt, 1^ teaspoonful pepper and 1}4 teaspoonfuls 
mustard; mix well. Heat to the boiling point 
1 cupful vinegar and a lump of butter the size 
of a pigeon's egg; while this is heating beat to a 
stiff froth ^'^e whites of the 2 eggs and mix with 



Salads. 125 

the other ingredients, beating well; then add the 
boiling vinegar, a few drops at a time. Set on 
the fire 2 or 3 minutes, stirring constantly; beat 
a few minutes after removing it from the fire, 
and set away to cool. 



PIGKIeES. 

gNAMELED kettles should always be 
used in preference to those of brass or 
copper, as the verdigris produced by the 
vinegar on these metals is extremely poisonous. 
For some pickles use cold vinegar, as in boil- 
ing most of the strength is lost by evaporation. 
For French beans, broccoli, cauliflower, gher- 
kins, etc., it is better to heat the vinegar, for 
which the following process is recommended: 
Put the vinegar and spice in a jar, cover it 
tightly, let it simmer on the back of the stove. 
Shake occasionally. Pickles should never be 
put into glazed jars, as salt and vinegar pene- 
trate the glaze and produce a poison. 

Glass or stone jars are preferable to any 
other; a small piece of alum in each jar will 
make the pickles firm and crisp. One table- 
spoonful of sugar to each quart of vinegar will 
be found a very great improvement to all 
pickles. Always use the very best cider vine- 
gar. 

Pickled Onions — In the month of September, 
choose the small, white, round onions, take off 
the brown skin, have ready a very nice tin ste^^- 
pan of boiling water, throw in as many onions 
as will cover the top ; as soon as they look clear 
on the outside, take them up as quick as possible 
with a slice, and lay them on a clean cloth, cover 
them close with another, and scald some more, 
and so on. Let them lie to be cold, then put 
them in a jar, or glass, or wide-mouthed bottles, 
and pour over them the best vinegar, just hot 
but not boiling. To each gallon of vinegar add 
1 oz. allspice and 1 oz. black pepper. When 

126 



Pickles. 127 

cold, cover them. Should the outer skin shrivel, 
peel it off. They must look quite clear. 

Pickled Walnuts — Fifty walnuts (seasonable 
for pickling early in July). To each pint of vin- 
egar allow 1 oz. black pepper, ^ oz, allspice, and 
'^2 OZ. bruised ginger. 

Prick the walnuts with a fork,' and put them in 
a brine (composed of 1 lb. salt to each quart of 
water). Let them remain in this 9 days, chang- 
ing the brine three times. Put them in the sun 
until they turn black; put them into jars, allow- 
ing sufficient room to cover them with vinegar; 
boil (or scald) vinegar and spices in the above 
proportions. Cover closely and keep dry. They 
can be used in 6 weeks. 

Juiul)0 Pickle — Chop fine a head of cabbage, 
sprinkle with salt; let it remain thus for 12 hours: 
then mix 1 onion finely minced with the cab- 
bage; drain through a colander; add a good 
quantity of pepper and celery seed. Put it in a 
jar and cover with vinegar. Ready for use in 3 
days. 

Red Cabbage — Slice into a colander, and 
sprinkle each layer with salt; let it drain 2 days, 
then put it into a jar, and pour hot vinegar 
enough to cover, and put in a few slices of red 
beetroot. Observe to choose the purple red cab- 
bage. Those who like the flavor of spice will 
boil it with the vinegar. Cauliflower cut in 
branches, and thrown in after being salted, will 
look a beautiful red. 

Green Tomato Pickles — One peck green 
tomatoes; 1 dozen large white onions, sliced 
crosswise to fall into rings; 1 oz. whole pepper, 
1 oz. white mustard seed, 1 oz. cloves, 1 oz. all- 
spice. Put a layer of tomatoes and onions, then 
a good handful of salt, etc., till all are in a stone 
jar; then put a plate on top and weight down 



128 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

over night; in morning squeeze out with hand 
and put to boil in kettle, putting in layers with 
spice; add 1 gal. best malt vinegar, and boil 20 
minutes. Put in stone jar to keep. 

Damson and Cherry Pickles — To 5 pounds 
fruit put 3 pounds sugar, 1 qt. vinegar, 4 table- 
spoonfuls or 2 oz. cinnamon, 1 tablespoonful 
cloves, as much mace. Put the fruit in a jar. 
Boil the vinegar, sugar and spices, and pour 
them boiling hot on the fruit. Tie the spices 
loosely in muslin before boiling. 

Ripe Peaches Pickle — Pare them and drop 
them in vinegar that has been boiled, with 1 tea- 
cup sugar to 1 qt. vinegar, and 12 cloves, a 
teaspoon of whole allspice and three large 
sticks of cinnamon. Always tie spice in cheese 
cloth or muslin loosely before boiling. 

Picalilli — Small cucumbers, button onions, 
small bunches of cauliflower, carrots, ginger, 
grapes, strips of horse-radish, radishes, bean 
pods, cayenne pods, 4 qts. best vinegar, 4 table- 
spoonfuls salt, mustard and flour, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls ground ginger, pepper, allspice and turmeric. 

The brine for this pickle is made by putting a 
pint of rock salt into a pail of boiling water. 
Put the vegetables for pickling into the brine 
and cover tightly to prevent the steam escaping. 
Allow them to stand a night and a day. Change 
the brine a second time and allow them to remain 
the same length of time. The second brine may 
be used a second time if skimmed and scalded. 
Choose pickles from the brine of an equal size 
and of various colors. Great taste may be dis- 
played in the arrangement of the pickles when 
putting them in bottles. To 4 qts. of best vin- 
egar add the spices. Simmer these together (the 
mustard and turmeric must be blended together 
with a little vinegar before they are added to the 



Pickles. 129 ] 

liquor) ; when the liquor is on the point of boil- j 

ing, pour into a vessel; cover tightly. When ; 

sufficiently cold pour into the bottles containing 3 

the pickle, and make air-tight. It will be ready i 

for use in 5 or 6 months. 'l 

Beets — Vinegar, beets, 2 oz. whole pepper, 2 ] 

oz. allspice to every gallon of vinegar. 1 

Carefully remove all dirt from the beets. Let 

them simmer in boiling water for 1'^ hours, then ; 

take them out and leave to cool. Boil the | 

remaining ingredients for 10 or 15 minutes * 

and leave to cool. When cold pour it over the , 

beets (which you have previously pared and cut ; 
into thin slices). Make air-tight and they will 

be ready for eating in a week or 10 days. '\ 



§GG§. 



ABOUT one-third of the entire weight of an 
egg may be regarded as nitrogenous and 
nutritious matter; a greater proportion 
than that of meat, which is rated at only from 
25 to 28 per cent. The Hghtest way of cooking 
eggs is by poaching. The yolk of an egg alone 
is better for invalids and will be frequently rel- 
ished when the white would be rejected. When 
cream cannot be procured for coffee the yolk of 
a soft-boiled egg is a very good substitute. To 
prevent the juice of fruit pies from soaking into 
the bottom crust wash the crust over with beaten 
egg before putting in the fruit. When making 
frosting in warm weather, set the whites of the 
eggs on ice a short time before using. If the 
eggs you have to use for frosting are not quite 
as fresh as you could desire, a pinch of salt will 
make them beat stiffer. The white of an egg, 
an equal quantity of cold water and con- 
fectioners' sugar sufficient to make the 
required consistency, make a nice frosting 
which, as it requires no beating, is very 
easily made. When beaten eggs are to be 
mixed with hot milk, as in making gravies or 
custards, dip the hot milk into the beaten eggs 
a spoonful at a time, stirring well each time 
until the eggs are well thinned, then add both 
together. This will prevent the eggs from 
curdling. 

The whites or yolks of eggs which are left 
after making cake, etc., will keep well for a day 
or two if set in a cool place — the yolks well 
beaten and the whites unbeaten. Whites or 
yolks of eggs may be used with whole eggs 

130 



^ggs. 131 

in any cake or other recipe calling for eggs, 
counting two yolks or two whites as one egg. 
When eggs are cheap and plentiful in summer, 
wash all those used in cooking before breaking, 
save the shells, and when a quantity are dry, 
crush them fine; beat half a dozen eggs well 
and stir them into the shells. Spread them 
where they will dry quickly, and when thor- 
oughly dry, put in a tJiin cotton bag and hang 
in a dry place. In the winter, when eggs are 
dear, a tablespoonful of this mixture put in a 
cup, a little cold water poured over it and left 
to stand over night, or for half an hour or so in 
the morning before breakfast, will answer every 
purpose of a whole egg in settling coffee. 

It is a good plan in testing eggs to apply 
the tongne to the large end of the egg, and if 
perfectly fresh the egg will feel warm, or they 
can be held to the light and if perfectly clear 
will be good; or try them in water — the freshest 
will sink first. Always keep them in a cool 
place. 

Poached E^gs (on Toast)— If the eggs are 
not new-laid they will not poach well. Fill a 
shallow saucepan with water and salt, add a 
little vinegar, a few peppercorns, and some 
leaves of parsley. When the water is on the 
point of boiling (it should never be allowed to 
boil) break 2 or more eggs into it (according to 
the size of the pan) ; when done, take them out 
carefully, lay them on slices of hot buttered 
toast, and serve. 

Poached Eggs (on Ham Toast)— Make some 
buttered toast, cut in pieces of uniform shape, 



132 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

spread over them a small quantity of grated 
ham, put a poached egg on each piece of toast, 
and serve hot. 

Poached Eggs and Minced Chicken— Free 

some remnants of fowl from skin, etc., mince 
them with an eqnal quantity of ham or tongue, 
as well as a small quantity of truffles or mush- 
rooms, all finely minced; toss the whole in a 
saucepan with a good-sized piece of butter 
mixed with a pinch of flour, add white pepper, 
salt and powdered spices to taste, and moisten 
with a little white stock; lastly, stir in, off the 
fire, the yolk of 1 egg beaten up with the jaice 
of }/2 lenion, and strained; serve within a border 
of bread sippets fried in butter, and dispose the 
poached eggs on the top. 

Stuffed Eggs — Cut some hard-boiled eggs in 
half, mince the yolks with a few olives and 
capers, some anchovies thoroughly washed, a few 
truffle trimmings, and a little tarragon, add some 
pepper, and fill each half egg with this mixture. 
Pour some liquefied butter over, and warm them 
in the oven. Then place each half-egg on a 
round sippet of bread fried in butter to a light 
yellow color, and serve. 

Buttered Eggs — Break 4 eggs into a basin, 
and beat them well; put 2 oz. butter and 2 table- 
spoonfuls cream into a saucepan; add a little 
grated tongue, pepper and salt to taste; when 
quite hot, add the eggs, stir till nearly set, then 
spread the mixture on pieces of buttered toast 
and serve. 

Fried Eggs — Melt a piece of butter in a 
email frying-pan, break 2 eggs in it carefully so 
as not to break the yolks; when nearly set, slip 
them out on a hot dish, pour the butter over them, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and serve. 



Eggs. 133 

Fried Eggs with Tomatoes — Melt a small 
piece of butter in a saucepan, put to it a small 
quantity of French tomato sauce, add pepper 
and salt to taste, and when quite hot turn it 
out on a dish, disposing on it the eggs fried in 
butter. 

Scrambled Eggs — Beat up 4 eggs, with salt 
and pepper to taste; put 1 oz. butter into a 
saucepan; directly it is melted put in the eggs, 
and keep constantly stirring with a spoon until 
they are nearly set, adding at the last a little 
finely-minced parsley. 

Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus — Parboil 

some asparagus points, cut the size of peas, in 
salted water, drain them and toss them in a little 
butter till quite hot. Scramble some eggs as in 
the preceding recipe, and, when nearly set, add 
the asparagns points instead of the parsley. 

Scrambled Eggs with Tomatoes — Beat up 
4 eggs with a tablespoonful of French tomato 
sauce, or one large tomato, peeled, freed from 
pips, and chopped small, and proceed as above. 

Scrambled Eggs with Onions — Chop coarsely 
2 slices of Spanish onion; put them into a sauce- 
pan with plenty of butter, and when they are 
thoroughly cooked, without having taken any 
color, throw in 4 eggs beaten together with pep- 
per and salt to taste; keep on stirring till the eggs 
are nearly set, and then serve. 

Scrambled Eggs with Fish— Pick out the 

meat of any remnants of fish, such as salmon, 
turbot, cod, haddock or whiting, and with a 
silver fork break it up small; take 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of this and 4 eggs; beat the whole together 
with a little pepper and salt to taste, and a little 
parsley finely minced; then proceed as in first 
recipe. 



134 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Scramlbled Eggs with Ham — Beat up a 

tablespoonful of grated ham with 4 eggs, and 
pepper to taste; put them into a saucepan with 
a piece of butter, and stir till nearly set. 

Scrambled Eggs with Cheese — Put 4 eggs 
and 3 tablospoonfuls of Parmesan cheese into 
a basin with a sprinkling of pepper; beat all 
together, and proceed as in the first recipe, 
omitting the parsley. 

Scrambled Eggs (on Toast) — Any of the 

foregoing may be served on slices of buttered 
toast, but if so served they must be even less set, 
at the time of serving, than when served plain; 
or neat bread sippets, fried in butter, may be 
served round them. 

Sippets (Fried) — Cut out of a loaf slices 
from 3^ to % in. thick, shape them into triangles 
or arrowheads, all of a size; put some butter in 
a frying-pan, and when quite hot lay the sippets 
in it; turn them frequently, adding more butter 
as it is wanted, and taking care that they are all 
fried to the same golden color. A readier way, 
but producing not so nice a sippet, is to lay the 
pieces of bread in the frying-basket, and dip it 
in a saucepan full of boiling fat. They must 
afterwards be laid in front of the fire to drain. 

Omelet (Plaiu) — Beat up 3 or 4 eggs with 1 
dessertspoonful of parsley very finely minced, 
and pepper and salt to taste; put a piece of but- 
ter, the size of an egg, into a frying-pan; as soon 
as it is melted pour in the omelet mixture, and, 
holding the handle of the pan with one hand, 
stir the omelet with the other by means of a 
spoon. The moment it begins to set cease stir- 
ring, but keep on shaking the pan for a minute 
or so; then with the spoon double up the omelet 
and keep shaking the pan until the under side of 



Eggs. 135 

the omelet has become of a golden color. Turn 
it out on a hot dish and serve. 

Omelet — One-half cupful sweet milk, 1 of fine 
bread crumbs, 2 eggs, whites and yolks beaten 
separately, ^ teaspoonful chopped sage or a 
whole one of parsley; pepper and salt to taste. 
Mix well, adding the white of egg last; melt a 
lump of butter in a large frying-pan, pour in 
your mixture, and, taking a silver knife, gently 
lift it away from the sides as the eg^ " sets." 
Then put in the oven until it browns on top, fold 
over and serve on a hot plate. 

Omelet — The following makes a delicious 
omelet for four persons: Break 5 eggs, putting 
the whites in one dish and the yolks in another. 
Beat the yolks to a froth, then add a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, a little pepper, a heaping tablespoon- 
ful of finely chopped parsley, and 5 tablespoon- 
fuls of cream. Beat all together for a moment 
and then add the whites, previously beaten to a 
stiff froth. Mix gently together and pour imme- 
diately into a hot spider containing a level 
tablespoonful of melted butter. Cook rather 
slowly in order not to burn the bottom before 
the omelet is cooked through, and when nicely 
browned fold half over. Place on a warm plat- 
ter, and serve immediately. 

Omelet (Savory) — Beat up 3 or 4 eggs with 
3^ shallot very finely minced, some parsley 
similarly treated, and a very small pinch of pow- 
dered sweet herbs; add pepper and salt to taste; 
then proceed as above. 

Omelet (Cheese) — Beat up 3 eggs with 1 or 
2 tablespoonfuls grated Parmesan cheese. Cook 
as above, and serve with some more grated 
cheese strewn over the omelet. 

Omelet (Tomato) — Equal parts of sliced 
onions and tomatoes peeled and freed from pips; 



136 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

chop them both coarsely. Fry the onions in 
butter. When cooked, without being colored, add 
►the tomatoes, with pepper and salt, and keep 
stirring the mixture on the fire till it forms a 
sort of puree. Make a plain omelet, and insert 
this in the fold on dishing it. 

Omelet (Mushroom) — Parboil a small quan- 
tity of button mushrooms, slice them small, and 
stew them just long enough to cook them in a 
small quantity ^ either white or brown sauce 
(see Sauces) ; then use as in preceding recipe. 

Omelet (Fish) — Beat up 3 eggs with a quan- 
tity equal in bulk to 1 egg of the remnants of 
any cold fish (salmon or turbot) finely shredded 
with a fork, a pinch of minced parsley, pepper 
and salt to taste. 

Omelet (Oysters)— See "Oysters." 



(sATSUPS, gT6. 

Lemon Catsup — One doz. lemons, % break- 
fast cupful white niustard seed, 1 e^gcupful 
turmeric and white pepper, Yi eggcupful cloves 
and mace, 3^ a small teacupful white sugar, 1 
saltspoonful cayenne, 3^ a small teacupful horse- 
radish, 3^ a small teacupful salt, 4 shallots. 

Finely grate the rind of lemons, pound the 
spices in a mortar, grate the horse-radish. 
Thoroughly blend these ingredients, then sprinkle 
the salt over all, extract the juice from the 
lemons and add to the mixture. Allow to stand 
in a cool place for 3 or 4 hours. Boil in an en- 
ameled kettle 30 minutes, pour into a stone jar, 
cover tightly. Stir every day for 14 days, then 
strain, bottle and seal. 

Tomato Catsup (1) — To 1 peck tomatoes allow 
1 tablespoonful salt, mace, black pepper, cloves 
powdered, and 1 of celery seed; a teaspoonful 
cayenne, Y ^b. tin of mustard. 

Make a small incision in each tomato, put into 
an enameled saucepan, and boil until perfectly 
soft, and the pulp dissolved; work through a 
colander, then through a hair sieve. Place upon 
the stove, adding the remaining ingredients (the 
celery seed must be confined in a muslin bag), 
and boil 6 hours. Stir occasionally for the first 
5 hours, and all the last hour. Pour into a stone 
jar; allow to stand from 12 to 14 hours in a cold 
place. When perfectly cool add a pint of strong 
vinegar, remove the celery seed, bottle, cork, and 
seal. Keep in a dry, dark place. 

Tomato Catsup (2) — Ripe tomatoes; to every 
lb. of juice add a pint of vinegar, a dessertspoon- 
ful sliced garlic, a small teaspoonful of salt and 
white pepper. 

Place a number of ripe tomatoes in a jar; 
cover and bake till tender. Strain and work 

137 



138 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

through a sieve, and add the above ingredients. 
Pour into a stewpan and boil until the ingre- 
dients are perfectly soft. Work through the 
sieve a second time, and to every pound squeeze 
the juice of three lemons. Boil' again until of 
the thickness of cream. Set aside to get cold. 
Bottle, cork and seal, and keep in a dry, dark 
place. 

Walnut Catsup — Wash the shells of walnuts,, 
bruise them slightly, put them with salt in a 
stone jar for two or three weeks until they fer- 
ment, then boil them up, strain off the liquor, 
add to every 2 quarts 1 oz. each of allspice, 
ginger, black pepper, cloves and mace; boil the 
whole 1 hour; let it cool, bottle it, and tie a blad- 
der over the corks. 

French Mustard — One quart of brown mus- 
tard seed, 1 handful each of parsley, chervil, tar- 
ragon and burnet, 1 teaspoonful of celery seed, 
cloves, mace, garlic, salt to taste, enough vinegar 
to cover. 

Put the whole into a basin with enough vinegar 
to cover the mixture. Let it steep 24 hours, 
then pound it in a marble mortar. When thor- 
oughly pounded pass it through a fine sieve; add 
enough vinegar to make the mustard of the de- 
sired consistency, and put into jars for use. 

Mint Vineg'ar — A wide-mouthed bottle or 
bottles. Fill them (loosely) with nice, fresh mint 
leaves, then add good vinegar to fill the bottle or 
bottles; cork well. Allow to stand for two or 
three weeks, and at the expiration of this time 
strain into fresh bottles and cork securely. Use- 
ful when mint is not in season. 

Herbs (to Dry) — Gather the herbs for drying 
before they begin to flower. Free from dirt and 
dust and tie in bunches, having previously re- 
moved the roots. Dry in the oven or before the 



Catsups, Etc. 139 

fire; in either case, dry quickly, as the flavor is 
better preserved by quick drying. Upon no con- 
sideration allow them to burn. Tie up in paper 
bags and hang in a dry place. N. B. — Take care 
to gather the herbs on a dry day. 

Herb Powder (for winter use)— Take 2 oz. 
each of winter savory, sweet marjoram, lemon, 
thyme, lemon peel and 4 oz. of parsley. 

Thoroughly dry the herbs and take off the 
leaves. Grind to a powder and pass through a 
sieve. Dry the lemon peel and pound as finely 
as possible, then mix all together thoroughly. 
Keep in glass bottles tightly corked. 

Parsley (to keep for winter use) — Take fresh 
bunches of parsley; plunge into boiling water 
slightly salted, boiling for 3 or 4 minutes. Re- 
move from the water, and drain dry very quickly 
before the fire, and put in bottles for use. Soak 
in tepid water 5 minutes when required for 
cooking. 

Garlic Vinegar — Steep an ounce of garlic in 
2 quarts of the best white vinegar; add a nutmeg 
scraped. This vinegar is much esteemed by the 
French. 

A Useful Catsup — One and one-half pints 
mushroom catsup, 3^ pint walnut pickle, 2 
tablespoonfuls Chile vinegar, 2 shallots. 

Take 13^ pints of freshly-made mushroom 
catsup, peel the shallots and add them to the 
catsup and allow it to simmer for 10 minutes, 
then add the pickle and vinegar and boil again 
for 10 minutes. Stand in a cool place, and when 
perfectly cold, bottle, and, having placed a small 
piece of shallot in each bottle, cork and set by 
for use. 



FORGBMBATS. 

WHETHER in the form of stuffing-balls 
or for patties, forcemeat makes a con- 
siderable part of good cooking, by the 
flavor it imparts to the dish it accompanies, and 
considerable care should be taken in preparing 
it. It is often the case, at many excellent tables 
where everything else is well done, to find very 
bad forcemeat or stuffing. 

Forcemeat (for Fowls) — Quarter lb. suet, 2 
oz. ham, the grated rind of )^ lemon, a dessert- 
spoonful of minced parsley, 1 tablespoonful of 
minced sweet herbs, cayenne, salt, grounded 
mace to taste, 7 oz. bread-crumbs, 2 eggs. 

Cut the ham into small, thin strips, chop the 
suet finely, also the lemon peel; add the season- 
ing, then the crumbs; thoroughly blend, and after 
the eggs have been well beaten add to the other 
ingredients, and it is ready for use. If wished, 
for balls, fry a golden brown in hot lard. 

Forcemeat (Balls for Soup)— Eight oz. 
bread-crumbs, sweet herbs, salt and pepper to 
taste, 5 eggs. 

Have the bread-crumbs finely grated, and the 
herbs pounded to a powder; sprinkle with pepper 
and salt; boil 2 eggs hard and mince finely. 
Mix all together and bind the whole with the re- 
maining eggs. Form into little balls, and drop 
into the soup about 5 or 6 minutes before 
serving. 

Oyster Forcemeat (for Roast or Boiled Tur- 
key) — Two teacupfuls bread-crumbs, 3^ oz. 
minced suet, 1 tablespoonful savory herbs a 
sprinkle of nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste, 2 
eggs, 1^4, doz. oysters. 

Have the bread-crumbs and suet finely mificed, 
add the herbs chopped as finely as possible; mix 

140 



Forcemeats. 141 

well. Having opened the oysters, beard and 
chop them (not very small) and add to the other 
ingredients; beat up the eggs, and with the hand 
work all together thoroughly; it is then ready 
for use. 

Sage and Onion Stuffing (for Pork, Ducks, 
Geese) — Two teacups bread-crumbs, 4 large 
onions, 12 sage leaves, butter the size of an &gg, 
pepper and salt to taste, 1 egg. 

Peel and boil the onions for 5 or 6 minutes, 
dip the sage leaves in the same water (while 
boiling) for a minute or two, then chop finely; add 
seasoning, the bread-crumbs and butter; beat up 
the egg, and work all together. It is then ready 
for use 

Quenelles — Moisten 1 cup of finely-crumbed 
bread with 3 tablespoonfuls of milk, add 2 table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter and as much finely- 
chopped meat (stewed veal or fowl, cold) as you 
wish, work in 1 well-beaten egg, and season all 
thoroughly with salt and pepper; flour your 
hands, and shape mass into round balls, rolling 
them into flour when shaped. Bring to a boiling 
heat in a saucepan 1 large cup well-seasoned 
gravy, drop in the balls, and boil fast for about 
5 minutes. The gravy can be thickened and 
poured over them, or they can be rolled in flour 
or cracker crumbs, and fried in lard or butter. 



BREAD AND (sAKBS. 

OF all articles of food, bread is perhaps the 
most important ; therefore it is necessary 
to be well acquainted with the quality of 
the ingredients and the art of making it. 
Flour ought to be a few weeks old before being 
used, and care must be taken to keep it per- 
fectly dry. It is of the utmost imjDortance to 
purchase only the best quality of tlour, for it is 
the truest economy. Patent flour should be 
more scantily measured than winter wheat, as it 
contains more gluten. Do not place the sponge 
or dough too near the fire, as some cooks are 
liable to do in cold weather, or the quality of 
bread will be endangered. The proper heat 
should be gentle and equal for fermentation. 
Care must also be taken to mix and knead 
(brisk and long kneading will fully repay for 
the trouble) when it has reached the point for 
either. Bread requires a brisk oven, and should 
take about 1 to 1^ hours to bake. The cook 
must be guided by experience as to the exact 
degree of heat. 

The secret of biscuit-making is precision 
and dispatch. Laggards and lazy people are 
not successful biscuit-makers. The best cooks 
always say they simply throw their biscuits to- 
gether, and certainly they are not long about 
it. The cause of success is that biscuits begin 
to bake before the effervescent qualities of the 
powder or soda are exhausted. 

For good cake ( as in bread ) it is of great im- 
portance to use no ingredients but those of the 
finest quality. The flour must be dry and 
sifted. It will be found a good plan, after 

142 



Bread and Cakes. 143 

purchasing currants, to wash in three waters, 
pick and dry in a cloth. Then look them care- 
fully over, discarding any stone, stalk or grit. 
Lay before the fire or in the sun to dry. Put 
by in a jar, and they will always be ready for 
use. Eggs should be well whisked, the whites 
and yolks beaten separately and strained. But- 
ter must not be allowed to oil. Lemon peel 
should be cut thinly as possible. Sugar should 
be finely powdered. When soda is used it is a 
good plan to dissolve it in warm water. When 
all the ingredients are mixed, vigorous and 
patient beating will greatly add to the lightness 
of the cake. The heat of the oven is of great 
importance for cakes, especially those that are 
large. If the oven is not very quick, the batter 
will not rise. Should you fear scorching, put 
some paper over the cake. If the fire is not 
long enough lighted to have a body of heat, or 
if it has become slack, the cake will be heavy. 
To know when the cake is done, take a broom 
straw and pierce into the very center, draw it 
instantly out, and if the least stickiness adheres, 
put the cake back immediately and shut the 
oven. 

Fine sugar should be used in cake-making 
to give good texture. Cake pans with movable 
bottoms are more easily managed, for they may 
be placed on a teacup and the rim will fall off. 
The milk in cake-making should be added 
slowly. Butter the tins, then flour them. 

Yeast (1) —A double handful of hops, ^ doz. 
potatoes, % gal. water, 1 or ^ cupful ginger, 
small cup flour, a cup brown sugar, )^ cup salt, a 
cupful good yeast. 



144 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Allow the hops and potatoes to boil together 
in }/2 gallon of water till done; strain and 
mash the ginger, then add remaining ingre- 
dients, excepting the yeast. Let stand until cool, 
then add the yeast. Next day cork up tight in a 

Yeast (2) — Two oz. hops, 1 gal. water, a 
handful salt, 1 lb. best flour, 3 lbs. potatoes. 

Boil the hops in a gallon of water for 3^ 
hour; strain it, and let it cool down to the heat 
of new milk; then put the salt and moist sugar; 
beat the flour with some of the liquor, and then 
mix all together. Two days after, add the pota- 
toes, boiled and then mashed, to stand for 24 
hours; then put into bottles, and it will be ready 
for use. Stir it frequently while making, and 
keep it warm. Before using, shake the bottle up 
well. It will keep in a cool place for two 
months. 

To Make Baking-Powder — Take % lb. of 
ground rice, 3^ lb. carbonate of soda, 2 oz. tar- 
taric acid. Mix them very thoroughly and 
smoothly. Allow 1 teaspoonful to 1 lb. of flour. 

Anotheb Way — Mix well together 6 oz. car- 
bonate of soda, 4 oz. tartaric acid, 1 teaspoonful 
salt, and 1 teaspoonful powdered sugar. 

Home-Made Bread (l) — Four lbs. flour, 1 
tablespoonful solid brewers' yeast, 1)^ pints 
lukewarm milk and water, salt. 

Put the flour into a deep pan, sprinkle a little 
salt into it, hollow out the middle with a wooden 
spoon (taking care to leave the bottom of the 
pan well covered with flour). Next take the 
yeast, which has been made solid by liberally 
mixing with cold water, and allowing it to settle 
24 hours. Then proceed to pour the yeast into 
the hole in the flour, and mix with it as much 
flour as is round about it until it is of the con- 



Bread and Cakes. 146 

sistency of thick batter; be careful there are no 
lumps. Sift plenty of flour over the top, cover 
with a clean cloth, and set it where the air is 
warm and equal. Allow to stand an hour or a 
little longer, and if the yeast has broken through 
it is then ready to be made into dough. Pour 
into the sponge the remaining milk and water. 
Mix into it as much of the flour as you can with 
the spoon. Now take plenty of the flour, sprinkle 
on the top of the leaven, and proceed to knead 
briskly, and when perfectly free from the lumps 
and it does not adhere to the hands, it may be cov- 
ered with a cloth and left to rise a second time. 
When it begins to crack, which will be in about 
% of an hour, it can be formed into loaves and 
baked. In forming the loaves divide in two and 
make up the shape and size required, and with 
a sharp knife make incisions in the top of each 
loaf. If baked in tins, take care to grease them 
before using. When baked stand on end to allow 
the steam to evaporate. The dough can be 
made without making a sponge (if desired) by 
mixing the yeast with the best part of the milk 
and water, and after a little salt ha^ been added^ 
proceed to work up the whole of the flour at 
once, and then act as above. The dough will 
soften in the rising, so it should be made firm at 
first. 

Home-Made Bread (2) — Put the flour into a 
large pan; mix in a dessertspoonful of salt; 
make a hole in the middle, and pour in the yeast 
(half a teacup of yeast to two quarts of flour), 
with about a pint of water or milk (which use 
warm in winter, and cold in summer), not mixing 
in all the flour; then put a blanket, or towel, over 
the pan, and let it stand to rise near the fire, in 
winter. This is " putting bread in sponge." 
When it has risen, mix all the flour with the 
sponge; knead it well, and let it stand 2 hours 

10

till quite light. Then mold the dough on a board 
till elastic, and put the loaves into greased or 
floured baking-tins; prick them two or three 
times through with a fork; let them rise again 
for a quarter of an hour, and bake them in a 
quick oven. 

White Bread — Sponge, a pan of buttermilk, 
or sour milk, flour, 1 teacupful of yeast. 

For the sponge take a pan of buttermilk or 
sour milk which has just turned thick. Put it 
on the stove and scald. When the curd is well 
separated from the whey strain or skim it out. 
Let the whey cool until it will not scald, then 
stir in the flour, beating thorougly. It should 
be about as thick as batter for griddle cake. 
Sweet milk, or even water, may be used as a wet- 
ting for the sponge, if good sour milk or butter- 
milk cannot be had. But fresh buttermilk is, 
perhaps, the best of all. When the sponge is 
about milkwarm, beat in a teacupful of yeast. 
One teacupful of the yeast is enough for three 
ordinary white loaves, one loaf of brown bread 
and a tin of rolls. The sponge should be made 
at night. Let it stand until morning. Unless 
the weather is very cold, it is not necessary to 
put it near the fire. In the morning, when the 
sponge is light, take out enough for your loaf of 
brown bread. Mix the remainder with flour, 
taking care not to put in too much, as that will 
make the bread dry and hard. Knead ^ an 
hour. The whiteness and delicacy of the bread 
will be much increased by thorough kneading. 
Put the dough away to rise again. When it is 
light, if you wish to make rolls, save enough of 
the dough for that purpose. Make the remain- 
der into loaves. Set them away to rise. When 
light, bake. 



Bread and Cakes. 147 

Fine Wheat Bread— For 4 loaves: 1 pint wa- 
ter, 1 cake compressed yeast, 1 tablespoonful 
salt, 1 tablespoonful sugar. 

Mix hard or sitff, as for baking, at first. Set 
it to rise; when it has risen, knead it again; let 
rise again. If mixed in the morning — which is 
the best when using compressed yeast — after 
the second rising, put it in the pans, and it will 
be ready to bake in the afternoon. Be sure and 
knead it when it first rises, and then let it rise 
again. 

Plain Bread — Half lb. white flour, 1 tea- 
spoonful baking-powder, a pinch of salt, }^ pint 
milk and water. 

The simplest way of making bread in small 
quantities is as follows: Take 3^ lb. of white 
flour, and, while in a dry state, mix in thor- 
oughly a small teaspoonf ul baking-powder and a 
pinch of salt. Then add about a quarter of a 
pint of milk and water, or water alone; knead it 
as quickly as possible, and put immediately into 
a very hot oven; the whole secret of making 
light bread after this fashion lies in attention to 
these last rules. If the oven is well heated, it 
will rise almost directly, and it should be baked 
until the outside is quite crisp and hard. I gener- 
ally knead mine into the desired shape, but they 
can be baked in tins if preferred. For brown 
bread, I use three parts of brown and one of white 
flour, and a little extra baking-powder; also add- 
ing a little more water, if necessary, to mix it. 

Rice and Wheat Bread — One lb. rice, 2 
quarts water, 4 lbs. flour, 4 large spoonfuls yeast, 
salt. 

Simmer 1 lb. rice in 2 quarts water till it be- 
comes perfectly soft; when it is of a proper 
warmth, mix it extremely well with 4 lbs. flour, 
and yeast and salt as for other bread; of yeast 



148 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

about 4 large spoonfuls; knead it extremely wellj 
then set it to rise before the fire. Some of the 
flour should be reserved to make up the loaves. 
If the rice should require more water, it must be 
added, as some rice swells more than others. 

French Bread — One-fourth pk. fine flour, 
yolks of 3 and whites of 2 eggs, salt, 3^ pt. good 
yeast, 3^ pt. milk. 

With ^ pk. fine flour mix the yolks of 3 and 
whites of 2 eggs, beaten and strained, a little 
salt, }/2 P*' of good yeast, that is not bitter, and 
as much milk, made a little warm, as will work 
into a thin, light dough; stir it about, but don't 
knead it; have ready 3 wooden quart dishes, divide 
the dough among them, set to rise, then turn 
them out into the oven, which must be quick. 
Rasp when done. 

Sa^o Scones — Take a teacupful of sago and 
soak in cold water, put it on with 1 qt. sweet 
milk, let it boil till quite dissolved, stirring oc- 
casionally; add a little salt, then pour out on 
the baking-board and let it lie till cold. Mix up 
with flour, taking care not to make it too stiff; 
roll out quite thin, cut to the size wanted, and 
bake. 

Brown Bread — One pt. com meal, 1 pt. rye 
flour, 1 tablespoonful brown sugar, 1 teaspoonful 
salt, 2 cf baking-powder, 1 tablespoonful lard, ^ 
pt. milk. 

Sift together the above ingredients, excepting 
the lard and milk; rub into the mixture the lard 
and add the milk. Mix into a batter-like cake 
and bake 1 hour. Protect it with brown paper 
if it should brown too fast at first. 

Boston Brown Bread — One and one-half 
cups yellow cornmeal, 1 cup rye flour, 1 cup 
Graham flour, 1 cup New Orleans molasses, 2 full 
teaspoonfuls baking-powder and a little salt. 



Bread and Cakes. 149 

Mix all to a consistency of a thick batter with 
either milk or water, pour into a buttered mold 
or tin pail, and steam in boiling water 4 hours. 

Rye Bread — Two cups Indian meal, scalding 
water, a small cap of white bread sponge, sugar, 
salt, a teaspoonful of soda, rye. 

Make the Indian meal into a thick batter 
with scalding water; when cool add the white 
bread sponge, a little sugar and salt, and 
the soda, dissolved. In this stir as much rye 
as is possible with a spoon; let it rise until 
it is very light; then work in with your hand 
as much rye as you can, but do not knead 
it, as that will make it hard; put it in but- 
tered bread tins, and let it rise for about 15 min- 
utes; then bake it for 1^^ hours, cooling the oven 
gradually for the last 20 minutes. 

Corn Bread — Take 2 cups flour, 1 cup corn- 
meal, }4. cup sugar, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons butter, 
l}/£ cups sweet milk, 3 teaspoons baking-powder;

boiling water, 1 cup flour, 2 cups sour milk, 1 
cup molasses, 1 teaspoonful soda, a little salt. 

Scjald 2 cup's cornmeal with boiling water, add 
another cup of meal and remaining ingredients. 
Mix thoroughly, and steam 3 hours. 

Bread Omelet — A teacupful bread-crumbs, 1 
teacupful sweet milk, 6 eggs, pepper, salt, a 
small lump of butter. 

Let the milk come to the boiling point, pour 
it over the crumbs and let it stand a few min- 
utes; take the eggs, beat them well and pour into 
the bread mixture; season with salt and pepper 
and a small lump of butter; when thoroughly 
mixed, butter a hot skillet and pour the mixture 
in, letting it fry slowly; when one side is browned 
nicely, cut it in squares and turn. Serve at once. 



150 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Barley Scones — Take l quart sweet milk and 
put it on in a pan with a little salt. When it 
boils, stir in barley-meal until it is as thick as 
porridge, pour out on the baking-board and let 
it stand till cold. Knead up ??ith barley-meal to 
a nice soft dough, roll out and cut to the size 
wanted, and bake. 

Rusks — One pint new milk, 2 tablespoonfuls 
yeast, flour, 2 tablespoonfuls butter, 1 cupful 
sugar, 2 eggs, 2 saitspoonfuls salt. 

Rusks require a longer time for rising than 
ordinary rolls or biscuits. Prepare a sponge of 
the yeast, milk and flour (suflBcient to make a 
thin batter) and allow it to rise all night. Next 
morning add eggs, butter and sugar (which must 
have been mixed well together), salt and flour 
enough to produce a soft dough. Shape into 
neat balls of equal size, place in a pan and allow 
to rise until very light. Flavor according to 
taste. Bake in a quick, steady oven till of a 
pretty brown color, glaze with the yolk of an 
egg and sprinkle with powdered white sugar. 

Butter Rolls — One quart flour, }4, teaspoon- 
ful salt, 2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder, 1 egg, 1 
pint milk, 1 tablespoonful lard.

mix as soft as possible. Roll it out i^ inch in 
thickness and cut with a plain, round biscuit 
cutter. Dip them in melted butter, fold }^ of 
each piece over the remainder and bake in a 
quick oven for 15 minutes. 

Tienna Rolls — One quart milk, }4 teaspoon- 
ful salt, 3 teaspoonfuls baking-powder, 1 table- 
spoonful lard, 1 pint milk. 

Mix into a dough easily to be handled without 
sticking to the hands; turn on the board and 
roil out to the thickness of 3^ 



Bread and Cakes. 161 

with a large cake cutter, spread very lightly with 
butter, fold one-half over the other and lay them 
in a greased pan without touching. Wash them 
over with a little milk, and bake in a hot oven. 

French Rolls — Two eggs, ^ pint milk, 1 
tablespoonful yeast, 1 oz. butter. 

Beat 2 eggs and mix with them 3^ pint milk 
and a tablespoonful yeast; knead well and let 
stand till morning; then work in 1 oz. butter; 
mold into small rolls, and bake at once. 

Cinnamon Rolls — Save a piece of dough, 
about enough to make a loaf, out of your bread 
before you make it out for baking. To this 
dough add 1 egg, 1 tablespoonful butter, 3^ cup- 
ful milk, 1 cupful sugar and 1 tablespoonful 
cinnamon. Work thoroughly, make into rolls 
and set to rise. When almost done draw to the 
oven-door, spread lightly with butter and cover 
with a mixture made of 3 tablespoonfuls butter 
and 1 tablespoonful cinnamon. Good hot or cold. 

Parkin — One and three-fourths lbs. flour, % 
lb. oatmeal, 4 oz. butter, 2 lbs. molasses, a tea- 
cupful milk, 6 teaspoonfuls baking-powder, 1 
dessertspoonful ground ginger. 

Mix the dry ingredients well together, warm 
the molasses with milk (do not make it hot) and 
mix the whole. Bake in a well-buttered tin for 
1 hour. Cut into squares before taking out of 
the tin. It should be 13^ inches thick. 

Breakfast Rolls — Two quarts flour, 1 table- 
spoonful sugar, 1 tablespoonful butter, 3^ cupful 
yeast, 1 pint scalded milk, or water if milk is 
scarce, and a little salt. 

Set to rise until light; then knead until hard 
and set to rise, and when wanted make in rolls; 
place a piece of butter between the folds, and 
bake in a slow oven. 



152 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Grraham Biscuits — One quart water or milk, 
butter the size of an egg, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 
2 tablespoonfuls baker's yeast, and a pinch of 
salt; enough white flour to use up the water, 
making it the consistency of batter cakes, and 
as much Graham flour as can be stirred in with 
a spoon. 

Set it away till morning; in the morning grease 
pan, flour hands; take a lump of dough the size 
of a large egg; roll lightly between the palms; 
let them rise 20 minutes and bake in a tolerably 
hot oven. 

Sally Lunn — Two lbs. flour, ^ lb. butter, 3 
eggs, 1 pint milk, )^ gill yeast, salt according to 
taste. 

Cut up the butter in the flour, and with your

Warm the milk and butter together; beat the 
eggs, and add them by turns with the flour; stir 
in the yeast and salt. When they are light, heat 
your waffle-irons and butter them, pour in some 
of the batter, and brown them on both sides; 
butter them, and serve them with or without 
sugar and cinnamon. 

Waffles (without Yeast)— Three eggs, 1 pt. 
milk, 1 teaspoonful butter, as much flour as will 
make a batter. 

Beat the yolks and whites separately; melt the 
butter, and while lukewarm stir it into the milk; 
whisk the yolks very light, add to them the milk 
and flour alternately; beat it well; lastly stir in 
the whites, which should be whisked very dry. 
The batter should not be beaten after the whites 
are in. Grease your waffle-irons after having

heated them; fill them nearly fnll of the batter, 
close them, and place them over the fire; turn 
the irons so as to bake the waflSe on both sides. 
When done, take it out and butter it. These 
must be baked the moment they are mixed. 

Rice Waffles — One gill rice, 3 gills flour, salt 
to taste, 1 oz. butter, 3 eggs, as much milk as 
will make it a thick batter. 

Boil the rice in very little water until it is soft; 
drain it and mash it fine. Then add the butter 
to the rice whilst it is warm; whisk the eggs very 
light, the yolks and whites separately. Add the 
yolks to the rice, and as much milk as will form 
a batter. Beat the whole very hard, then stir 
the whites of the eggs gently into the mixture. 
Grease your waffle-irons, and bake them. If the 
batter should be too thin, add a little more 
flour. 

Italian Bread — Mix 1 pt. each of milk and 
water and bring to a boil, add 1 teaspoon salt, 
and sprinkle m gradually 1 pt. meal and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Cook 2 hours. Pour to the 
depths of 3^ inch in shallow pans to cool; when 
cold cut in round cakes; put in overlapping rows 
in pan; pour melted butter over, then grated 
cheese; brown in oven. 

Crackers — One pt. flour, 1 dessertspoon but- 
ter, a pinch of salt and milk enough to make a 
stiff dough. Beat well, stick and bake. 

Beaten Biscuit — One qt. flour, 2% oz. lard, 1 
teacup milk, 1 teaspoon salt. Mix the greater 
part of the flour with the other ingredients and 
beat 15 minutes, adding the rest of the flour by 
degrees. They require a steady heat, but not 
too hot an oven. They should bake }4, hour, 
otherwise they will be heavy and dark in the 
middle. 



Bread and Cakes. 155 

Puff Biscuit — One and one-half pts. flour, 
3 teaspoonfuls baking-powder and 1 teaspoonful 
salt, 1 tablespoonful lard, 1% cups milk. Chop 
the lard through the flour; sift in salt and add 
the milk. Roll out quickly, touching as ittle 
as possible. Cut in rather large circles; spread 
one-half of the circle with butter, then fold the 
other over it; bake 15 minutes. If you choose, 
you can sprinkle sugar on the top. 

Pop-Overs— Make of equal proportions (say 
2 cups) milk and flour, 2 eggs, a little salt butter 
the size of an egg. 

Mix the salt in the flour; mix well, melt the 
butter and add to other ingredients; the last 
thing, grease and half fill the tins; bake quickly. 

Crullers — Take 2 cups sugar, 1 cup sweet 
milk, 3 eggs and 1 tablespoonful butter; beat all 
together, then add a good pinch of salt, 1 tea- 
spoon level full of grated nutmeg, 1 heaping full 
of cinnamon and the grated rind of a lemon. 
Now mix thoroughly together 3 cupfuls flour and 
2 heaping teaspoonfuls baking-powder; sift into 
the bowl containing the other ingredients and 
mix them. Add enough more flour to give them 
the proper consistency for rolling out. Fry in 
hot lard, which must be exactly hot enough to 
insure success. If too hot they are burned; if 
not hot enough, as is so often the case, your 
crullers slowly take up the lard and come out 
greasy and indigestible. 

Musk Cakes— One qt. milk, }^ pound butter, 
flour enough to make a dough, salt according to 
taste, Indian meal sufficient to thicken the milk, 
^ pint of yeast. 

Boil the milk, and stir into it as much Indian 
meal, mixed with cold milk, as will make a mush 
as thick as batter; add the butter and salt while 
the mush is hot; as soon as it becomes lukewarm 



156 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

stir in the yeast and as much flour as will form a 
dough; cover it and stand it to rise. When 
light, make it out into biscuits, put them in but- 
tered pans, and as soon as they rise again, bake 
them in a hot oven. 

Buckwheat Cakes — One pint buckwheat flour, 
1 qt. water, salt according to taste, 1 gill home- 
made yeast. 

Mix the water (which should be lukewarm if 
the weather is cold) with the meal; add the salt 
and yeast; beat it well; when light, bake them 
on a griddle. Grease the griddle; pour on a 
little of the batter; spread it so as to form a 
cake about the size of a breakfast-plate; the 
cakes should be very smooth at the edges. When 
they are done on one side, turn them; when 
brown on both sides, put some butter on the 
plate, put the cake on it, butter the top, bake 
another and put on it, butter hot, and send them 
to the table. Buckwheat cakes are much better 
if they are sent to the table with only 1 or 2 on 
the plate. 

Eye Batter Cakes — One pint of rye meal, 
milk, salt according to taste, 1 gill home-made 
yeast. 

Add enough lukewarm milk to the rye to make 
a thin batter, with salt; beat it well, then add the 
yeast; when they are light, bake them on a grid- 
dle, as buckwheat cakes. 

Plain Currant Cake— Take ^ lb. flour, 2 
teaspoonfuls baking-powder, }^ lb. butter, 3^1 lb. 
sugar, 6 oz. currants, milk.

gredients, and mix with milk into a moist dough. 
Bake in a well greased tin for about 40 minutes. 

Icing' for Cakes — Beat up the whites of 3 eggs 
with ^ lb. of powdered white sugar till light; 
pour it over the cake, smoothing it with a knife. 



Bread and Cakes. 167 

Set the cake in a warm place till the sugar be- 
comes hard. 

Sponge Jelly Cake— Three eggs, 4 oz. sugar, 
1 cup flour, 1 dessertspoonful baking-powder, 3 
tables poonfuls boiling water. 

Mix the baking-powder with the flour, and 
beat each of the eggs separately. Then mix all 
the ingredients together, and bake in jelly tins 
in a brisk oven. When cool, chocolate frosting 
put between the cakes makes them very delici- 
ous, or jelly if preferred. 

Jelly Rolls— Three eggs, 3^ cupful butter, 13^ 
teaspoonfuls baking-powder, f^ of a cup of pul- 
verized sugar, 1 cupful flour, a little salt. 

Bake in shallow pans — a dripping-pan well 
buttered is good for this purpose; put in the 
dough till it is about 3^ inch thick; take it care- 
fully from the tins when baked and lay on a 
cloth; spread jelly over it evenly with a knife; 
roll while hot; if this is not done the cake will 
crumble. 

Sponge Jelly Cake (Rolled)— Five eggs, 1 
cup sugar, 1 cup flour, 1 teaspoonful baking- 
powder. 

Beat the yolks and sugar to a cream, add the 
whites, beaten to a stiff froth; then the flour, in 
which the baking-powder has been mixed. Bake 
in a dripping-pan. When done, turn out on a 
cloth, spread jelly on the bottom of the cake, 
and roll from the side. 

Johnny Cake — One pt. corn meal, 1 teacupful 
sugar, 1 pt. milk, 2 eggs, 1 teaspoonful butter, 
salt to taste, 1 teaspoonful dissolved saleratus. 

Mix the butter and sugar with the meal; boil 
half the milk. Add the dissolved saleratus and 
the eggs, after they have been well beaten, to 
the remaining half of the cold milk. Pour the 
boiling milk over the meal and let it cool. Then 



158 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

add the cold milk and saleratus. Bake in a shal- 
low pan. 

Icing for Cakes (1) —Four eggs, 1 lb. finely 
powdered white sugar, vanilla, strawberry, lemon, 
or any other flavoring. 

Beat well the whites of the eggs, adding the 
sugar to stiffen in small quantities; continue 
until you have beaten the eggs to a stiff froth; 
it will take about ^ an hour if well beaten all 
the time; if not stiff enough then, add more 
sugar; spread carefully on the cake with a 
broad-bladed knife; to color icing yellow put 
the grated peel of a lemon (or orange) into a 
piece of muslin, strain a little juice through it 
and press hard into the other ingredients. Straw- 
berry juice or cranberry syrup colors a pretty 
pink color. 

Icing for Cakes (2) — The whites of 2 eggs, 
3^ lb. castor sugar, and the juice of a lemon or 
a few drops of orange-flower water. 

Beat the mixture until it hangs upon the fork 
in flakes, then spread over the cake, dipping the 
knife in cold water occasionally; stand it before 
the fire, and keep turning the cake constantly, 
or the sugar will catch and turn brown. As soon 
as it begins to harden it may be removed. The 
icing must not be put on until the cake itself is 
cold; otherwise it will not set. A few drops of 
cochineal will color it if desired. 

Lemon Icing* — Squeeze the juice of 2 lemons 
into a basin with 3^ lb. of powdered white su^ar, 
and beat it for a short time. If wanted pmk, 
add cochineal. 

Egoless Icing —Take 1 cupful confectioner's 
sugar and 2 tablespoonfuls water; beat thor- 
oughly and spread on your cake, which should 
be ice-cold. The icing will whiten when it has 



Bread and Cakes. 159 

stood a little while. You may color it with pink 
sugar or chocolate if you like. 

Excellent Frosting* — Boil together 1 cup 
granulated sugar and 4 tablespoonfuls hot water 
until it threads from the spoon, stirring often. 
Beat the white of 1 egg until firm; when the 
sugar is ready set it from the stove long enough 
to stop boiling, then pour onto the egg slowly, 
but continually, beating rapidly; continue to 
beat until of the right consistency to spread 
on the cake, and flavor while beating. It hardens 
very quickly after it is ready to put on the cake, 
so it is best to have the white of another egg 
ready to add a little if it gets too hard to 
spread smoothly. Boil the sugar the same as 
for candy; when right for candy it is right for 
frosting; if at last it hardens very rapidly it has 
been boiled too hard, but a little white of egg 
will rectify it. Or if not boiled enough (that is, 
if it remains too thin after beaten until cold) 
put in pulverized sugar, adding a little and 
beating hard; then, if not just right, a little 
more, and beat again until thick enough. 

The one thing is to have the sugar boiled just 
right; if you hit that point you will not have a 
bit of trouble; if not, it will require "doctor- 
ing." A good deal depends upon stirring the 
sugar into the white of the egg at first; if too 
fast or too slow it will cook the egg in lumps. If 
you should not get it just right at first do not be 
discouraged; when once you get it perfect you 
will never make it any other way. This quantity 
is for one cake. 

Almond Icin^ — Put in a brass or copper pan 
4 lbs. moist sugar, with 1 pint of water. Boil 8 
minutes, draw off the fire, and mix 2 lbs. ground

Mix into the flour the baking powder and salt, 
then with the hands rub the dripping in the 
flour until it resembles bread-crumbs. Add the 
currants, allspice and sugar. Take care that the 
ingredients are well mixed; pour in the milk and 
mix with a wooden spoon. Grease a quartern 
tin and pour the mixture into it; bake 1 hour. 
To insure the cake being done stick a piece of 
broom straw into it. This answers the same 
purpose as a knife and is better, as the knife is 
apt to make the cake heavy. Turn the cake on 
end to allow the steam to evaporate. 

Plain Fruit Cake (2)— One lb. flour, i^ lb. 
raisins, 4 oz. dripping, 4 oz. white sugar, 1 tea-

raisins, grate the lemon rind, and with the sugar 
add to the other ingredients. Well whisk the 
egg, and mix in the milk, adding to the mixture; 
thoroughly mix. Grease a cake tin and bake 1 
hour. Proceed to test as above.

half worked in, put in ^ teaspoonful soda dis- 
solved in as little water as is possible to use; 
then add the whites of the eggs, and lastly the 
fruit, which is well covered with the rest of the 
flour. Bake in a large tin, with a buttered paper

PASTRY 



A GOOD hand at pastry will use less butter 
and produce lighter crust than others. 
Salt butter is very good, and if well 
washed makes a good, flaky crust. If the 
weather is warm the butter should be placed in 
ice water to keep it as firm as possible; when 
lard is used take care that it is perfectly sweet. 
In making pastry, as in other arts, " practice 
will make perfect;" it should be touched as 
lightly as possible, made in a cool place, and 
with hands perfectly cool; if possible, use a 
marble slab instead of pastry board; if the latter 
is used, it is better to procure it made of hard 
wood. 

It is important to use great expedition in the 
preparation of pastry, and care must be taken 
not to allow it to stand long before baking, or 
it will become flat and heavy. A brisk oven 
will be required for puff pastry ; a good plan ta 
test the projDer heat is to put a small piece of 
the paste in before baking the whole. Be sure 
that the oven is as near perfection as possible ; 
for an oven in which the heat is not evenly dis- 
tributed can never produce a well-baked pie or 
tart; where there is an unequal degree of heat 
the pastry rises on the hottest side in the shape 
of a large bubble and sinks into a heavy, indi- 
gestible lump on the coolest. Eaised pie cri^st 
should have a good soaking heat, and glazed 
pastry rather a slack heat. When suet is used 
it must be perfectly free from skin and minced 
as finely as possible: beef suet is considered the 
best, 

173 



174 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

All moulds, pie-dishes, patty-paos, and vessels 
of aU descriptions used for baking or boiling 
must be well buttered. 

The outside of a boiled pudding often tastes 
disagreeably, which arises from the cloth not 
being nicely washed and kept in a dry place. 
It should be dipped in boiling water, squeezed 
dry, and floured when to be used. If bread, it 
fihould be tied loosely; if batter, tightly over. 
The water should be boiling briskly when the 
pudding is put in. Batter pudding should be 
strained through a coarse sieve when all is 
mixed. In others the eggs separately. A pan 
of cold water should be ready, and the pudding 
dipped in as soon as it comes out of the pot, 
and then it will not adhere to the cloth. 

Snow is an excellent substitute for eggs 
either in puddings or pancakes. Two large 
spoonfuls will supply the place of one egg, and 
ihe article it is used in will be equally good. 
This is a useful piece of information, especially 
as snow often falls at the season when eggs are 
the dearest. 

Apple Pudding (Boiled) — Suet or butter 
crust, apples, sugar to taste, a little minced

crusts of French rolls, it may be soaked in as 
much cold milk as it will absorb, and when it is 
perfectly soft have sugar, eggs and flavoring 
added to it.

yolks of the eggs and mix gradually and effect- 
ually with the milk. Pour this mixture into the 
prepared mold. Lay a piece of paper on the 
top. Set it in a saucepan full of cold water, 
taking care that the water does not come over 
the top of the mould, put on the cover, and let it 
boil gently by the side of the fire for 1 hour. 
Remove the saucepan to a oool place, and when 
the water is quite cold take out the mould, and 
turn out the pudding very carefully.

near the edge; put in a layer of strawberry jam, 
not too thickly spread. Cut the inside of the 
cake you have taken out in slices, spread some 
jam between each slice (different sorts of jam 
may be used, but strawberry does very nicely),

sieve and leave to cool. Take a good-sized pud- 
ding mould, butter it well and line it with sponge 
cake cut into thin slices. Pour the custard into 
the mould and tie it close. It will take 1% hours 
to boil. It is an improvement, after buttering 
the mould and before placing the sponge cakes, to 
arrange some stoned raisins, slices of candied 
peel and nutmeg. Serve hot with sauce. 

Fig- Pudding-— One lb. flour, 2 oz. bread 
crumbs, 2 oz. finely-chopped suet, 2 oz. sugar, 1

lid of paste, and boil the pudding 1% hours. 
Care should be taken to roll the crust thin, in 



182 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

order to get as much fruit as possible into the 
pudding. It is a good plan to stew a little fruit, 
and serve it with the pudding, as it should be 
given to children in large proportion to the crust. 

Strawberry Saracen— Toast very thin slices 
of stale bread and line the bottom and sides of 
a China dish with them, after buttering gener- 
ously. Trim the bread to fit the dish neatly. 
Fill the space with strawberries packed and 
heaped as full as the dish will hold; sift plenty 
of sugar all through and over them, and set the 
dish in a moderate oven for about half an hour. 
It will be found that the berries melt a great 
deal, so they must be plentiful. Serve very cold 
with rich, thick cream. This is one of the most 
delicious desserts imaginable, notwithstanding 
that there are people who consider it almost a 
crime to cook strawberries in any way. 

Mince Pies — The sooner the Christmas mince 
meat is prepared and set away to ripen so much 
better will the pies made of it be. Take 3 lbs. 
lean beef from the round and boil it in enough 
water to cover it. When very tender, set it away 
till cold, and then chop very fine, carefully re- 
moving any piece of gristle or fat. Next weigh 
out 5 lbs. Greening apples; after peeling and 
coring them, chop fine and add to the meat. 
Chop fine ] lb. kidney suet and 2 lbs. seeded 
raisins and add to the above with 2 lbs. clean 
currants, % lb. citrons, finely shredded, and 4 
oz. each of candied orange and lemon peel (or 
the grated rind of 2 oranges and 2 lemons), and 
the pulp of 2 oranges and 2 lemons chopped and 
freed from seeds and tough bits. To these in- 
gredients add enough sugar to sweeten to taste, 
also 2 even tablespoonfuls cinnamon, 1 table- 
spoonful mace, 1 tablespoonful alspice and 1 
tablespoonful cloves, together with a grated nut- 



Pastry. 183 

meg and a good teaspoonful salt. Now add 
enough sweet cider to secure the right consist- 
ency — 3 pints or two quarts. Any fruit juice is 
an improvement, especially the juice from spiced 
pears or peaches. Some liberally disposed house- 
wives contribute a jar of preserved strawberries, 
or raspberries, or cherries, to their pot of mince, 
which is a rare improvement. When all has been 
thoroughly mixed, place the stone pot contain- 
ing the mince meat on the back of the range to 
warm slowly through, gradually moving it for- 
ward till it boils; then push it back to simmer 
for a few moments, after which it should be set 
away to cool. Keep in a cool place till wanted, 
and in making the pies sprinkle in about a 
dozen seeded raisins to each one. 

Plum Pudding- — Two lbs. beef suet, 1% lbs. 
bread crumbs, 1% lbs. flour, 2 lbs. raisins, 2^^ lbs. 
currants, % lb. mixed peel, 1% lbs. foots sugar, 
14 eggs, a little nutmeg, ginger, allspice (pow- 
dered), a large pinch of salt, % P^^* milk. 

Chop the suet as finely as possible, and any 
stale piece of bread can be used for grating, 
allowing the above quantity; mix with the suet 
and flour. Stone the raisins, and have the cur- 
rants perfectly washed and dried, the peel cut 
into thin slices and added to the suet, bread and 
flour, mixing well for some minutes; then add 
the sugar and continue working with the hands 
for 5 minutes. Put the eggs into a bowl (break- 
ing each into a cup first to ascertain that it is 
fresh and to remove the speck), add to them 
grated nutmeg, powdered ginger and powdered 
allspice, according to taste, and a large pinch of 
salt; then stir in 3^ pint milk; beat all up to- 
gether, and pour it gradually into another bowl, 
working the whole mixture with the hand for 
some time. If the mixture be too stiff, add 
more milk, and continue to work it with a 



184 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

wooden spoon for at least 3^^ hour. Scald 2 pud- 
ding cloths, spread each in a bowl and dredge 
them well with flour. Divide the composition in 
2 equal parts, put each in its cloth and tie it up 
tightly. To boil the pudding, place 2 inverted 
plates in saucepans filled with water, and when 
the water boils fast put each puddings into its 
saucepan. Let them boil 6 hours, keeping the 
saucepan full by adding more water as it is re- 
quired, and taking care that it never ceases 
boiling. Then take the pudding out and hang 
them up till the next day, when the cloth of each 
pudding should be tightened and tied afresh, 
and 3 hours' boiling, as in the first instance, will 
make them ready for table. 

Baked Custard — Five eggs, 5 tablespoonfuls 
sugar, 1 quart milk, 2 teaspoonfuls almond or

sary, and stir up again; the batter should be 
rather stiff. Have a good stout cloth ready; 
wet and flour it well, lay it over a pan, pour in 
the batter, and tie it firmly up. When the water

ter, and 1 teaspoonful baking-powder, and last 
of all mix in the batter 1}4 cupf uls of any kind of 
fruit well floured. Wet a cloth-bag— an old nap- 
kin makes a good bag — and sprinkle conscien- 
tiously with flour; then pour in the batter and 
tie up the neck of the bag very tightly, leaving 
a generous room for the pudding to swell, for it 
is as expansive as gossip. Have a kettle of boil- 
ing water and dump in the bag. You must turn 
the bag every 10 minutes for the first hour, then 
boil it for two hours longer, and if you have not 
let the supply of water run too low, or forgot to 
turn it, or scalded yourself in the manipulations 
and thus left too much of the pudding above 
water in your haste, or pricked the bag with 
your turning fork, or done anything else ruinous, 
you will have a pudding not nearly so indigesti- 
ble as you might suppose.

crust. 

Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside 
and out; in the former put a piece of butter, and, 
if approved, some parsley chopped with the 
livers, and a little of the seasoning; lay the 
steak at the bottom of the dish, and the birds 
on it; between every two a hard egg. Put the 
water in the dish, and if you have any ham in 
the house, lay a piece on each pigeon; it is a 
great improvement to the flavor. Observe, when 
the ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the under 
part rather than the prime. Season the gizzards, 
and the two joints of the wings, and put them in 
the center of the pie, and over them, in a hole 
made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to 
show what pie it is.

knuckle of veal or a piece of scrag, shank bone 
of mutton, herbs, onion, mace, and white 
pepper.

chicken, slices of ham, or gammon of bacon, 
forcemeat balls and hard eggs by turn in layers. 
If it be baked in a dish put a little water, but 
none if in a raised crust. By the time it returns 
from the oven have ready a gravy made of the 
veal or scrag, shank bones of mutton and season- 
ing. If to be eaten hot you may add truffles, 
morels, mushrooms, etc., but not if to be eaten 
cold. If it is made in a dish put as much gravy 
as will fill it; but in raised crust the gravy must

be nicely strained, and then put in cold as jelly. 
To make the jelly clear, you may give it a boil 
with the whites of two eggs, after taking away 
the meat, and then run it through a fine lawn 
sieve.

Stew the giblets in a small quantity of water 
with the seasoning till nearly done. Let them

(I use my jelly-cake tins) and bake exactly as for 
tart crusts. If you make more than you need, 
never mind, they will keep. While they are 
baking, if they rise in the center, take a fork and 
open the crust to let the air out. Now make the 
filling as follows: For one pie take a nice lemon 
and grate ofif the outside, taking care to get only 
the yellow; the white is bitter. Squeeze out all 
the juice; add white sugar, water and butter. 
Put in a basin on the stove. When it boils stir 
in the flour, and the yolk of one eg^i beaten 
smooth with a little water. When it boils thick 
take off the stove and let it cool. Fill vour pie 
crust with this. Beat the white of an egg stiff, 
add a heaping tablespoonful of sugar; pour over 
the top of the pie. Brown carefully in the oven.

at first and roll up tight. Roll it out again, and 
put the same proportion of butter, and so pro- 
ceed till all be worked up. 

Strawberry Tart — One Ih.^ ^ed flour, yolks 
of 2 eggs, 1 gill ice water, % lb. fresh butter, 1 
tablespoonful sifted sugar, strawberries. 

Rub the butter into the flour and sugar, add 
the yolks of eggs, and mix well with a knife; then 
add just enough ice water to make a paste that 
will roll out. It must be a firm paste, rather dry. 
Be careful that the flour is dry and the butter 
cold. Roll out the paste about one-third of an 
inch thick; line with it a pie-dish at least 1 inch 
deep with straight sides; trim the edges neatly, 
and bake the empty crust in a quick oven for 10 
to 12 minutes. When the tart is to be servev 
fill it neatly with strawberries, pour some of tht 
syrup over and serve with a pitcher of cream. 
The strawberries should not be allowed to stand 
'ong in the crust, or its crispness will be 
destroyed. The crust should be firm, brittle and 
crisp, not flaky. 

Sponge Cake — Three cups granulated sugar, 
7 eggs beaten separately, 1 cup lukewarm water, 

1 lemon, juice and grated rind, 3 cups flour and 

2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder.

and beat them very light with a silver fork; then 
add your sugar a little at a time, beating 
thoroughly; next add the lemon, then alternately 
the water and the flour, into which the baking- 
powder has been sifted; lastly add the whites of 
the eggs beaten very stiff and merely stirred in 
lightly, not beaten. Bake in a moderate oven, 
nd do not move the pan once put in.

ens like starch remove from the fire. When cool 
stir into it the well-beaten eggs and the soda. 
Drop the mixture onto the buttered tins with a 



204 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

large spoon. Bake till a light brown, in a quick 
oven. When done, open one side and fill with 
mock cream made as follows in the above pro- 
portions: Beat eggs to a froth; stir in the sugar, 
then flour; stir them into the milk while boiling; 
stir till it thickens, then remove from the fire

up on a dish with sifted sugar over. 

Orange Fritters — Six large oranges peeled 
and sliced, two well-beaten eggs, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, and enough flour to make a batter 
about as stiff as if for flannel cakes; dip the 
oranges into the batter, being sure that they are 
well covered by it, then fry in plenty of boiling 
lard; drain on coarse brown paper, sift powdered 
sugar over the fritters and serve. 

Apple Fritters — Sift together 1 cupful flour, 
2 tablespoonfuls sugar, 1 teaspoonful baking-

light, and add 3^ cupful milk; pour this grad- 
ually into the dry mixture, beating well; add 2 
apples cut fine. Drop by spoonfuls into hot fat 
and fry; drain and sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. Pastry flour should be used for fritters, 
as bread flour contains too much gluten. Bread 
flour should be used only when yeast is added. 
The apples should be cut fine or chopped; the 
fritters are also very good if the apples are cut 
in thick slices, dipped in the batter, and then 
fried.

flavoring, and place the apple in the center of a 
dish, arranging thickly and tastefully around it 
neatly cut pieces of the carefully fried bread. If 
it is desired to make this dish very nice, each 
piece of fried bread may be dipped in apricot 
jam. Rhubarb charlotte may be made in the 
same manner. The rhubarb must be boiled and 
stirred until a good deal of the watery portion 
has evaporated, and then sugar, i^ lb. to 1 lb. of 
fruit, being added, it should be allowed to boil 
until it is thick.

Oranges — Oranges may be prepared for table 
in the following manner: Cut gently through the 
peel only, from the point of the orange at the 
top to dent made at the bottom, dividing the 
outside of orange into cloves or sections, seven 
or eight in number. Loosen the peel carefully, 
and take each section off, leaving it attached only 
at the bottom. Scrape the white off the orange 
itself, and turn in each section double to the bot- 
tom of the orange, so that the whole looks like a 
dahlia or some other flower. 

Almonds and Raisins — Serve on a glass dish, 
the raisins piled high in the center. Blanch the 
almonds and strew over them. 

Frosted Currants — Froth the white of an 
egg or eggs, dipping the bunches into the mix- 
ture. Drain until nearly dry, then roll in white 
sugar. Lay upon white paper to dry. 

Impromptu Dessert — Cover the bottom of a

smoothly with the syrup and pour all into a mould. 
Stir into the cream (or if there is none at hand, 
new milk must answer) the eggs well beaten; 
also the sugar, and let it just boil up in a farina 
kettle; then set aside to cool. When cold take 
the apples from the mould and pour this cream 
custard around it and serve. If spice or flavor- 
ing is agreeable, nutmeg, vanilla or rose water 
can be used. 

210 



Dessert. 211 

Disll of Fig:s — One cup sugar, % cup water, 
3^ teaspoonful cream of tartar. 

Let the sugar and water boil until it is a pale 
brown color; shake gently the basin in which it 
is boiling, to prevent it burning, but do not 
stir it at all until just before you take it from 
the fire; then stir in the cream of tartar. Wash 
and cut open some figs; spread them on a plat- 
ter, then pour the sugar over them. Take care 
to have each fig covered; set them in a cool place 
till the sugar has time to harden. 

A Dish of Nuts — Arrange them piled high in 
the center of a dish; a few leaves around the edge 
of the dish will greatly improve the appearance. 
In dishing filberts serve them with the outer 
skin on. If walnuts, wipe with a damp cloth 
before serving. 



HOME-MADE CANDIES. 

MEN, women and children — not to mention 
dogs and horses — like sugar, and the 
taste is entirely defensible. These 
white crystals, this frost of honey, feed the 
ever-burning flame of the body, supplying 
animal heat, which is life, and rousing the 
nervous energies like phosphates, or better 
than phosphates in some cases. I have had 
brain-fag so entire that it seemed as if I never 
could write or had written a Hne, relieved by 
taking a syrupy small glass of eau sucree^ when 
shortly ideas gathered and took shape and the 
blank brain resumed its work. I can't help 
fancying that the sweets craved so ardently 
by children have much to do with furnishing 
nerve aliment to their fast-growing systems. 
Sugar contributes both animal heat and nervous 
force, and seems to be a transformation of the 
elements of heat, as the diamond is transformed 
carbon. 

In the terrible retreat ttom Moscow, the few 
of Napoleon's army who secreted a few pounds 
of sugar to eat were enabled to support the in- 
tense cold. In tropic countries Europeans 
learned to drink eau sucree before long walks 
as a preventive of sunstroke and paralysis, and 
the French Algerian troops carry sugar on their 
marches to enable them to withstand the desert 
heat. Persons with spinal inflammation and 
paralytic tendencies often have a craving for 
sweets, which is nature reaching instinctively 
for help, and indulgence in such cases is fol- 
lowed by improvement. 

212 



Home-Made Candies. 213 

As much pure sugar or sweets as can be eaten 
without producing acidity is not only safe but 
beneficial for any one who craves it. Disturb- 
ance seldom follows in any ordinary case when 
the sweets are perfectly pure and are taken at 
proper times, not nibbled constantly between 
meals. 

Confectionery is one of the perquisites of 
childhood, and as choice French candies are 
beyond the capacity of many a mother's purse, 
and cheap ones are often made unwholesome, if 
not positively dangerous, by adulteration, home- 
made candies have become very popular, many 
delicious and attractive varieties being as easily 
made as any other toothsome dainties. As a pre- 
ventive of " graining," glucose (grape sugar or 
syrup) is much used in the manufacture of 
candy. But as it is not always convenient to 
procure, and often imparts a bitter flavor, the 
recipes here given are for the use of cream of 
tartar instead. 

A preparation called "fondant" — made by 
removing boiled syrup from the fire just before 
it will harden — is the foundation of nearly all 
French candies, and when once the art of mak- 
ing this is mastered a large variety of candies 
are easily made. 

Fondant — To 1 lb. sugar add }4 pi^* ^^^Id 
water and 3^ teaspoonful cream of tartar, and 
boil rapidly for 10 minutes without stirring. 
Dip the fingers into ice water, drop a little of 
the syrup into cold water, then roll it between 
the fingers, and if it forms a soft, creamy ball 
that doesn't adhere it is done. If not hard enough 
boil a little longer, and if too hard add a little 



214 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

water, boil up and test again. Set aside in the 
kettle to become lukewarm, then stir the mass 
with a ladle until it is white and dry at the edge. 
It should then be taken out and kneaded, exactly 
as one would knead bread dough, until it is creamy 
and soft. By covering with a damp cloth and 
keeping in a cool place it will keep well for 
several days, and several times this amount may 
be made at one time. In making several pounds 
it is better to divide the mass before kneading, 
and each part may be flavored differently. 

Chocolate Creams — Dust the moulding-board 
with as little flour as possible and roll a piece of 
fondant into a cylindrical shape. Cut it into reg- 
ular-shaped pieces, roll between the palms of the 
hands until round, lay on paraffine paper and let 
harden until the next day. Melt a cake of choco- 
late in a rather deep vessel that has been set in 
a pan of hot water; add a piece of paraffine half 
as large as a walnut, the same amount of butter, 
and }^ teaspoonful vanilla. Roll the cream in 
this, by using a steel fork or crochet needle, 
and place again on paraffine paper. 

iVut Rolls — Take equal parts of walnut, but- 
ternut, or whatever variety of nut meats you 
prefer, and fondant, mix well, and form into a 
roll. Cover this with plain fondant, roil in gran- 
ulated sugar and let harden until next day, then 
slice crosswise. 

Molasses Nut Balls and Bars — Boil 2 cup- 
fuls brown sugar, 1 of New Orleans molasses, 
and }4, cup water until it will snap when tested 
in cold water. Take from the stove, add 2 cup- 
fuls chopped walnut meats, stir until nearly cold, 
and then roll into balls between the palms of the 
hand; wrap in paraffine paper. 

For walnut or peanut bars boil together a cup- 
ful of New Orleans molasses, 1 of brown sugar, 



Home-Made Candies. 215 

and half a cup of water. When it stands the 
test of water add a tablespoonful each of butter 
and vinegar. When it boils up remove from the 
fire, add 3 teacupfuls peanut or walnut meats, 
pour into buttered shallow pans, smooth the 
top, and when nearly cold cut in bars or squares 
with a buttered knife. 

Cocoanut bars are made in the same way, 
using fresh cocoanut that has been dried out 2 
hours after being grated, or shredded cocoanut. 

Crystallizing- Syrup — Any variety of bon- 
bons made with fondant may be crystallized to 
make another attractive variety by the following 
process: Boil 1^^ lbs. sugar and % pint water 
until it forms a thread that will snap easily. 
Remove from the fire, and when nearly cold 
sprinkle a tablespoonful of water on the top 
to dissolve the film. Have the candies in a shal- 
low pan, pour the syrup carefully over, touching 
each part; cover with a dainty cloth, resting on 
the syrup to prevent the formation of a crust. 
After standing 6 hours, with a hat pin remove 
the candies, place on paraffine paper, spread a 
damp cloth over, and leave until dry. 

Jelly Rolls — Roll out evenly a piece of plain 
fondant, spread with any variety of fruit jelly or 
marmalade preferred, and when hard cut into 
slices and crystallize as above. 

Chocolate Caramels— Half lb. Baker's choco- 
late, 3 lbs. sugar, half granulated and half 
brown, the latter not too moist, ^ lb. butter, 1 
small cup milk. 

Mix the ingredients and boil until it hardens 
in cold water, which should be about 20 minutes. 
Stir all the time if you wish the caramels to be 
" crumbly." 

Cocoanut Bon-bons — To the white of one 
egg and an equal quantity of water add enough 



216 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

pulverized sugar and grated cocoanut to enable 
you to make into balls; lay the balls on greased 
plates. Take two cups of sugar and one of water 
and boil until it creams, then add one teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla or rose water; set the dish contain- 
ing this mixture on another containing boiling 
water, so it will not get too hard; then roll the 
balls in it as yon would chocolate creams, and 
lay on greased plates to harden. 

Almond Taffy — Boil together % pint wa- 
ter and 1 lb. brown sugar for 10 minutes. 
Blanch and slice through the middle 1}/^ oz. 
almonds; stir them in the syrup with 2 oz. of 
butter. Let the mixture boil hard for 10 min- 
utes. Pour on a well-buttered dish to the thick- 



Everton Taffy — Put a pound of brown sugar 
in a buttered pan, together with 3 tablespoonfuls 
of water. Let it boil until it becomes a smooth, 
thick syrup. Add ^ pound of butter, stirring 
well. Let this boil ^ hour; add lemon fla- 
voring. 

Butterscotch — Use 3 cupf uls of New Orleans 
molasses, 2 cupfuls granulated sugar, ^ cupful 
butter, and a very little water. Cook quickly 
about 20 minutes. Try a little in cold water, to 
see when it becomes crisp. Just before taking 
up add % teaspoonful baking-soda well mashed 
and smooth. Pour into buttered tins and cut 
as soon as it becomes perfectly cool. 

Sug'ar Candy — Put in a shallow pan 3 cupfuls 
granulated sugar, 3^ cupful water, ^ cupful

with }y^ teaspoonful cooking-soda, dissolved in 
hot water. Cook quickly, without stirring, for 1 
hour, or until it crisps in cold water. Pull while

qnite hot with buttered finger tips, and continue 
pulling until the candy is white. Chop into 
small pieces. 

Candied Fruit — Boil 1 cupful granulated 
sugar, 4 tablespoonfuls water, 2 tablespoonfuls 
vinegar and ^ spoonful soda. Avoid stirring. 
When the mixture is boiled to a syrup, dip into 
it cherries, grapes, pine-apple, oranges, pears, 
etc. When well dipped place the fruit on paraf- 
fine paper and put in a warm place to dry. 
Chestnuts and filberts thus candied are delicious. 

Hoarliound Candy — Hoarhound candy is a 
favorite cough remedy. To 1 quart of water add 
a small handful of hoarhound herb, and boil }4 
hour. Strain, pressing all the liquid from the 
herbs. Add 3 lbs. of brown sugar, and boil to 
the " hard crack." Put in a piece of butter as 
large as a walnut. When the butter is dissolved, 
pour the mass on a greased platter or marble 
slab. When almost cold, square off with a knife. 

Molasses Taify — Boil together 2 cupfuls of 
brown sugar, 1 of New Orleans molasses, ^ cup- 
ful of water, and 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar; 
when crisp, add a tablespoonful of butter, stir 1 
minute, then remove from the fire, add 3^ tea- 
spoonful soda; when nearly cold pull until a 
beautiful golden color. 

French Almond Rock — Put 1 lb. of loaf- 
sugar and a teacupf ul of water into a saucepan, 
stir it until the sugar is melted, take off the scum 
that comes to the top, and when boiled for ^ 
hour add 1 tablespoonful vinegar or lemon juice. 
Stir in sliced almonds to taste, pour out on a 
well-buttered tin and cut into slices. 

Lemon Candy — Into a bright tinned kettle 
put 3}4 lbs. of sugar, Ij^ pints of water, and a 
full tablespoonful of cream of tartar. Place over 



218 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

a hot fire and stir -antil the lumps disappear. 
Boil briskly until the candy is hard and brittle 
when a little is thrown into cold water. Take 
the candy from the fire and pour it on a large 
platter, greased with a little butter. When cooled 
sufficiently to be handled, add a teaspoonful of 
finely powdered tartaric acid, and the same 
quantity of extract of lemon, and work them into 
the mass. The acid should be fine and free from 
lumps. The mass must be worked enough to 
distribute the acid and lemon extract evenly, but 
no more, as too much handling destroys its 
transparency. It may now be formed into sticks 
or drops, or spread out flat on tins in thin 
sheets. 

Molasses Caudy — Dissolve 1 cupful of sugar 
in }/2 cupful of vinegar, mix with 1 quart of 
molasses, and boil, stirring often, until it hardens 
when dropped from a spoon into cold water; 
then stir in a piece of butter the size of an egg 
and 1 teaspoonful of saleratus, the latter dis- 
solved in hot water. Flavor to your taste, give 
a hard final stir, and pour into buttered dishes. 
As it cools, cut into squares for " taffy," or, while 
soft enough to handle, pull white into sticks, 
using only the buttered tips of your fingers for 
that purpose. 

"Old-Fashioned" Molasses Candy — Into a 
kettle holding 4 times the amount of molasses to 
be used, pour a convenient quantity of good 
New Orleans molasses. Boil over a slow fire half 
an hour, stirring all the time, and taking off the 
kettle if there is any danger of the contents 
running over. Do not let the candy burn. When 
a little dropped in cold water becomes quickly 
hard and brittle, add a teaspoonful of carbonate 
of soda, free from lumps, to every 2 quarts, stir 
quickly to mix, and pour on greased platters to 



Home-Made Candies, 219 

cool. When suflQciently cool, pull back and 
forth, the hands being rubbed with butter to 
prevent the candy from sticking to them, until 
the candy is of a bright yellowish brown color. 
If you wish, flavor with vanilla or lemon. 

Cocoaimt Kisses — Beat together the whites 
of 2 eggs with as much granulated sugar as they 
will take up, making a rather stiff batter. Add a 
piece of butter the size of an English walnut and 
half a teaspoonful of vanilla or lemon extract. 
When beaten perfectly smooth, add grated cocoa- 
nut, which should be fresh and carefully pre- 
pared. Stir in the cocoanut, beating for some 
minutes. Then drop the prepared confection 
upon buttered tins and place them in a current 
of air to dry. Many confectioners put them at 
once in the oven; but they sometimes spread out 
if the heat is applied too soon. They may 
remain in the oven until slightly brown, or may 
merely be allowed to heat through and dry. 

Mrs. Senator Cullom's Candy — Mix to- 
gether the whites of 2 eggs, an equal quantity of 
cold water, and enough confectioners' sugar to 
make a stiff dough. It will require about 2 lbs. 
To prepare fruits and nuts, take seeds out of 
dates and fill with the cream; blanch almonds 
and cover with cream. Candied cherries are 
nice, taking little balls of the cream and putting 
a cherry on each. English walnuts are used in 
the same way as cherries. 

Marslmiallows — Dissolve 1 lb. clear white 
gum-arabic in 1 quart water; strain, add 1 lb. 
refined sugar, place on fire. Stir continually 
until sugar is dissolved and the mixture becomes 
of the consistency of honey. Next add gradually 
the beaten whites of 8 eggs; stir the mixture all 
the time until it thickens and does not adhere to 



220 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

the finger, pour into a tin slightly dusted with 
starch, and when cool divide with a sharp knife. 

Peppermint Drops — The peppermint and 
wintergreen drops which follow the ice cream 
course to prevent possible disturbance from 
chilling with the frozen dainties are made of 
pure sugar with half the quantity of arrowroot 
used for the cream drops, and essence of winter- 
green or mint to taste, rolled on a marble slab 
and cut oat in disks the size of a quarter dollar. 
Confectionery is a pretty art for ladies and a 
very convenient one where there are children 
with the traditional sweet tooth. And what adds 
more repute to a hostess' table than that it is 
furnished with tempting fresh bonbons of her 
own making ? 

Harmless Colorings for Candies — Vegetable 
colorings are always to be used, the juice of 
blood beet for deepest red, cranberry juice ting- 
ing a delicate pink, and cochineal — the sole ex- 
ception — giving a lovely rose. In coloring yel- 
low, carrot juice or a very little yolk of egg 
answers better than gamboge. Spinach furnishes 
the best green, and is prepared by cutting fresh 
spinach into very small pieces and expressing 
the juice,, A quarter oz. cochineal will color 
confectionery for a lifetime, and should be kept 
in a bottle closely corked. One bug is used at a 
time, pounding it and pouring on 2 or 3 tea- 
spoonfuls of boiling water, after which the liquid 
is bottled and will keep three months, only a 
drop or two being needed for any common 
quantity of confectionery or frosting. Blue is 
rarely used, and the drop of indigo needed will 
not hurt any one. The petals of yellow roses, 
infused in boiling water, yield a delicate dye 
which is charming with old-fashioned rosewater 
desserts. 



ICB 6REAM, IGB§, Btc. 

Frozen Custard — One quart rich milk, 1 
large cup sugar, 1 teaspoonful salt, yolks of 6 
eggs, 13^ teaspoonfuls almond flavoring, 1 cup 
cream. 

Let the milk come to a boil; beat the sugar, 
salt and eggs together, and add the milk, a few 
drops at a time; return to the double boiler and 
cook 5 minutes, stirring all the time. Set away 
to get cold, and freeze. 

Grape Sherbet — One quart grape juice, ob- 
tained by boiling the grapes half an hour and 
straining through a jelly bag, juice of 8 good- 
sized oranges, 1% cups sugar. 

Mix the orange and grape juice, strain and 
pour into your freezer. Freeze for 5 minutes, 
pour out and add the whites of 2 well-beaten 
eggs; return to the freezer and freeze for 20 min- 
utes. Remove the dasher and pack away for an 
hour, then serve. 

Peach Ice Cream — Two quarts ripe peaches, 
1 cup sugar, mix well and set away in a covered 
dish. Take one pint of milk and one of cream; 
let them come to a boil, mix together 1 cup 
sugar, 2 scant tablespoonfuls flour and a tea- 
spoonful salt, beat the eggs well, mix all; then 
add the boiling milk and cream. Return to your 
kettle and boil gently 20 minutes, stirring often 
to prevent sticking. When quite cold stir in the 
peaches, which must be mashed fine, and freeze. 

Lemon Water Ice — Half a box of gelatine, 
dissolved in 1 pint cold water. Take the juice 
of 8 lemons and mix with ly^ lbs. white sugar, 
then pour 1 quart of hot water on the sugar and 
lemons; pour 1% pints of boiling water over 
the gelatine, and when it is quite dissolved add 
to the rest of the ingredients. Strain and set 

221

away to cool; when cold whip 15 minutes, and 
freeze. 

Caramel Ice Cream — Burnt sugar ice cream 
is a favorite dish in Virginia, and it is often called 
caramel cream on account of its peculiar color, 
though it requires neither chocolate nor vanilla. 
It is made by pouring boiled custard, a little at a 
time, over a frying-pan in which brown sugar 
has been burned until it is a dark brown color. 
Keep on adding the custard, stirring all the time 
until the whole is smooth and the pan is full, 
then pour the contents back into the main bowl 
of custard, which should be the color of strong 
coffee when it is all mixed. The art in making 
this cream is in burning the sugar until it is 
exactly right. If this is properly prepared you 
have only to freeze it like any other custard. For 
1 gallon it requires 1 gallon of milk, 2 cups of 
white sugar, the yolks of 16 eggs, and 2 cups of 
brown sugar well burned. 

Chocolate Ice Cream — Six tablespoonfuls 
grated chocolate, 2 breakfast cups cream, 1 of 
fresh milk, )4, lt>- sugar. 

Stir the chocolate into the milk, mixing well, 
add remaining ingredients and freeze. 

Fruit Cream — One and one- quarter lbs. of 
any kind of preserved fruit, 1 quart cream, juice 
of 2 lemons, sugar to taste. 

Take the whole of the ingredients, and work 
through a sieve. Then freeze in a freezing-can, 
and work until it is frozen. Then turn out and 
serve. 

Ice Cream — One quart milk, 2 eggs, % lb. 
sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls corn-starch or arrowroot, 
1 qt. cream. 

Scald the milk, yolks of eggs, sugar, and corn- 
starch or arrowroot, until it is of the consistency 
of custard. Then allow to cool. When cool add 



Ice Cream, Ices, Etc. 223 

the cream whipped, and the whites of the eggs 
whisked to a stiff froth. Sweeten to taste, flavor, 
and freeze in the usnal way. 

Vanilla Ice Cream — Beat the yolks of 8 eggs 
with ^ of a pound of sugar until very light. Put 
13^ pints of rich milk on the fire to scald, highly 
flavored with vanilla. When the milk is scalded, 
stir it into the egg as soon as it is cool enough 
not to curdle. Now stir the mixture constantly 
until it has slightly thickened. Do not let it 
remain too long and curdle, or it will be spoiled. 
When taken off the fire again, mix in 3^ box of 
gelatine which has been soaked 3^ hour in 2 
tablespoonfuls of lukewarm water near the fire. 
The heat of the custard will be sufficient to dis- 
solve it if it is not already dissolved. Cool the 
custard well before putting it into the freezer, 
however; stir it almost constantly until it begins 
to set; then stir in lightly a pint of cream, 
whipped. Stir it for 2 or 3 minutes longer, put 
it into a mould, and return it to a second relay of 
ice and salt. 

Strawl)erry Water Ice — Boil 1 pint of water 
and 3 teacupfuls of granulated sugar for about 
10 minutes, skimming carefully. Remove from 
the fire and allow it to grow cold, then add 2 
pints of strawberry juice. Many people think 
the flavor is improved by adding a little currant 
juice. Beat the mixture well together and freeze. 
Red raspberry ice made in the same way is also 
excellent. 

Orange Water Ice — Rub sugar on the peel 
of 2 oranges and 1 lemon. Squeeze and strain 
the juice of the lemon and 6 oranges. Dissolve 
the flavored sugar with a little hot water, and 
mix with }/£ pint of syrup. If too sweet, add a 
little water. Strain into the freezing-pot, and 
finish as lemon water ice. 



224 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Crystal Palace Cream — A rich custard, }^ 
oz. gelatine dissolved in a little boiling water, 2 
sponge cakes, 2 macaroons, 2 tablespoonfuls milk. 

Make the custard, dissolve the gelatine, and 
when it is nearly cold pour into the custard, 
which must also be cool; soak the cakes and 
macaroons in the milk (or, if pref erredj any fruit 
syrup, which must be rich and sweet). Put the 
cakes into a mould and gently pour the cream 
over them ; let it stand till cold. A few glac^ 
cherries may be added. 

Lemon Cream — One pint of thick cream, 
yolks of 2 eggs, 4 oz. fine sugar, rind of 1 lemon 
cut thinly, juice of the lemon. 

Well beat the yolks and add to the cream, 
sugar and rind of the lemon; boil, and then stir 
it till almost cold; put the juice of a lemon into 
a dish and pour the cream upon it, stirring until 
quite cold. 

Lemon Cream, Solid — Half a pint of cream, 
the juice of 3 lemons and the rind of 2, ^ lb. 
loaf-sugar in small lumps. 

Rub the sugar on the lemons, and lay them at 
the bottom of the dish, pour the lemon- juice 
over, make the cream a little warm; then, stand- 
ing on a chair and with the dish on the ground, 
pour the cream on so as to froth it. 

Lemon Cream (without cream) — Four lem- 
ons, 12 tablespoonfuls water, 7 oz. powdered white 
sugar, yolks of 9 eggs. 

Peel the lemons very thinly into the above 
proportion of water, then squeeze the juice 
into the sugar. Beat the yolks thoroughly and 
add the peel and juice together, beating for some 
time. Then strain into your saucepan, set over 
a gentle fire and stir one way till thick and scald- 
ing hot. Do not let it boil or it will curdle. Serve 
in jelly glasses. 



225 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Cherry Cream — Take 2 qts. cherries, heaping 
quarts, and bruise them without removing the 
pits, throw over them % cupful sugar and let 
them stand in a cool place for 2 hours. Then 
strain. Sweeten the juice after straining, beat a 
pint of cream, gradually add the juice and the 
beaten whites of 2 eggs, continually whisking 
it till no more froth arises. The secret of suc- 
cess is to have cream and eggs all thoroughly 
chilled on ice, and in adding the juice a little at 
a time to prevent curdling. 

Nesselrode Pudding" — Make a custard with 
1 pint milk, 8 tablespoonfuls sifted sugar, and 
yolks of 7 eggs (or use 3^ pint milk and 3^ pint 
cream) ; let the milk come to the boil, then mix it 
with the other ingredients; after stirring for some 
time put the mixture in a pan over the fire and 
go on stirring till it thickens, but it must not 
boil, or it will curdle; strain and flavor it with 
vanilla or any other flavor. Divide the custard 
in two separate basins; flavor and color the one to 
taste, partly freeze it, and add a small tumblerful 
of whipped cream, slightly sweetened with pow- 
dered sugar. Meantime brown, in 3^ oz. fresh 
butter, 4 oz. blanched almonds and 1 oz. sifted 
sugar; pound this quite smooth, mix with the 
other half of the custard, strain and freeze. 
Mold the two ices in layers and freeze for 2 hours. 

Tutti Frutti — When a rich cream is partly 
frozen, candied cherries, English currants, 
chopped raisins, or any other candied fruits, 
chopped rather fine, are added; add about the 
same quantity of fruit as there is of ice-cream. 
Mould and imbed in ice and salt. Serve with 
whipped cream. 

Strawberry Ice Cream — Sprinkle sugar over 
the strawberries, mash them well and rub them 
through a sieve. To a pint of the juice add a 

15 



226 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

pint of good cream. Make it very sweet. Freeze 
it in the usual way, and, when beginning to set, 
stir in lightly 1 pint cream, whipped, and lastly 
a handful of whole strawberries, sweetened. Put 
it into a mould which is" imbedded in ice. Or, 
when fresh strawberries can not be obtained, 
there is no more delicious cream than that made 
with the French bottled strawberries. Mix the 
juice in the bottle with the cream, and add the 
whipped cream and the whole strawberries when 
the juice, etc., have partly set in the freezer. 

Pineapple Ice Cream — Make a plain vanilla 
ice cream and when partially frozen stir in ^^ 
can grated pineapple. Mix well and complete 
the freezing. The remainder of the pineapple 
may be converted into a most delicious trifle. 

Pineapple Trifle — Line a pretty dish with 
stale sponge cake and spread upon it the grated 
pineapple. Whip 1 pint sweet cream, sweeten 
and flavor with vanilla; stir in 1-5 box Nelson's 
gelatine which has been previously soaked in }^ 
cup cold water, then dissolved by adding }^ cup- 
ful boiling water. Pour this over the cake and 
set on ice to stiffen. 

(xrape Sherbet — Lay a square of cheese-cloth 
over a bowl; put in a pound of ripe grapes; 
mash very thoroughly with a wooden masher; 
squeeze out all the juice; add an equal amount 
of cold water, the juice of 1 lemon, and sugar 
enough to make it very sweet. Freeze as usual. 

Currant Ice — Boil l quart of water and a 
pound of sugar until reduced to a pint, skim it, 
take it off the fire, add a pint of currant juice; 
when partly frozen, stir in the whites of 4 eggs. 
Mould, and freeze again. A good ice for fever 
patients. 



Ice Cream, Ices, Etc. 227 

Lemon Sherbet — Soak 1 teaspoonful gela- 
tine in 3^ cup cold water, and dissolve with ^ 
cup boiling water. Add the juice of 6 lemons, 1 
pint sugar, and 3^2 ciips water. Strain and 
freeze. If the lemons have become dry by being 
kept in the house, let them soak in cold water 
for a little time. A good way is to pour boiling 
water over the fruit, and then drop into cold 
water. This would destroy any insects which 
might be in the peel. Lemons may be kept in 
sour milk with good result. The gelatine is not 
used for nutriment, but to give a better consist- 
ency to the sherbet. If it is not convenient to 
use a freezer, the sherbet may be frozen in a 
pail. Put the lemon mixture in the pail and 
pack into a pail of ice and rock salt, using half 
salt and half finely-cracked ice in alternate 
layers. When it becomes hardened, scrape the 
sherbet from the side of the pail, and beat with a 
Dover egg-beater. Pack down again, and keep 
closely covered until ready to serve. If the 
sherbet is to be frozen in an ice cream freezer, 
use two-thirds of ice and one-third of rock salt, 
in alternate layers. Turn the crank very slowly, 
as the slower it is turned the faster the cream is 
frozen and the smoother it is. If the crank is 
turned rapidly, the liquid is stirred about so that 
it does not come in contact with the sides of the 
can long enough to freeze. 

Peaches and Cream Frozen — Peel and 
quarter the fresh peaches; mix them with sugar 
and cream to taste. Arrange some of the quarters 
of the peaches tastefully in the bottom of a 
basin, then fill, and freeze the mass solid, without 
stirring. Turn it out to serve. 

Iced Pudding" — One and one-half pints of 
custard, composed of the yolks of 4 eggs, 4 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a flavoring of vanilla, 8 oz. 



228 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

fruits, consisting of equal parts of dried cherries, 
pine-apple, dried pears, or apricots, all cut into 
very small pieces. These fruits may be selected, 
or perhaps it would be more convenient to pur- 
chase 3^ lb. of the French preserved dried fruits; 
or add 1 oz. candied citron sliced, 2 oz. currants, 
2 oz. stoned and chopped raisins, and 3^ pint 
cream whipped. Freeze the custard in the usual 
manner, then mix in the fruits and whipped 
cream. Put into a mould, and place it on ice 
and salt. Serve whipped cream around it. 

Frozen Custard with Fruit — Two pints 
milk, same of cream, 6 eggs, 3 teacups sugar, 1 
pint berries, or peaches cut up small. 

Let the milk nearly boil; beat the yolks of the 
eggs with the sugar and add the milk by degrees. 
Whip the whites of the eggs to a froth and add 
to the mixture; put all in a saucepan, stirring 
until it is a nice thick and smooth custard. When 
perfectly cold whisk in the cream and freeze. If 
the custard is allowed to freeze itself, stir in the 
fruit after the second beating. 

Custard — One and a half quarts rich milk, 1 
cup sugar, }/£ box gelatine, 4 eggs, vanilla to 
taste. 

Dissolve the gelatine in tha milk; add the 
yolks and sugar; let it come to a boil, then 
remove from the fire. When cool, add whites of 
eggs, etc. Pour into mould. To be eaten with 
cream, if preferred. 

Chocolate Custard — One quart milk, yolks 
of 6 eggs, 6 tablespoonfuls sugar, ^ cup grated 
vanilla chocolate. 

Boil the ingredients until thick enough, stirring 
all the time. When nearly cold flavor with 
vanilla. Pour into cups, and put the whites of 
the eggs beaten with some powdered sugar on 
top. 



PRESERVES. 

FBUIT for preserving must be gathered in 
dry weather, and should be carefully 
selected, discarding all bruised fruit, and 
purchasing only that of the largest and finest 
quality. Use only the best white sugar. There 
is no economy in using common sugar, because 
it causes a greater amount of scum, which must 
of course be taken off. In making syrups the 
sugar must be pounded and dissolved in the 
syrup before setting on the fire; no syrups or 
jellies should be boiled too high. Fruits must 
not be put into a thick syrup at first. Fruits 
preserved whole or sliced may be boiled in a 
syrup made of two pounds of sugar to every 
pound of water, the quantity of syrup differing 
in some cases, but the general rule is one and a 
half the substance of fruit. The following has 
been found very good : To clarify six pounds of 
sugar, put into a preserving-pan, and pour into 
it five pints of cold spring water; in another 
pint beat lightly up the white of one small egg, 
but do not froth it very much ; add it to the 
sugar, and give it a stir to mix it well with the 
whole. Set the pan over a gentle fire when the 
sugar is nearly dissolved, and let the scum rise 
without being disturbed; when the syrup has 
boiled five minutes take it from the fire, let it 
stand a couple of minutes, and then skim it 
very clean; let it boil again, then throw in half 
a cup of cold water, which will bring the 
remainder of the scum to the surface; skim it 
until it is perfectly clear, strain it through a 
thin cloth, and it will be ready for use, or for 
further boiling. 

229 



230 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

All unripe fruit must be rendered quite tender 
by gentle scalding, before it is put into syrup, 
or it will not imbibe the sugar; and the syrup 
must be thin when it is first added to it, and be 
thickened afterwards by frequent boiling, or 
with additional sugar; or the fruit will shrivel 
instead of becoming plump and clear. A pound 
of sugar boiled for ten minutes in one pint of 
water will make a very light syrup ; but it will 
gradually thicken if rapidly boiled in an 
uncovered pan. Two pounds of sugar to the 
pint of water will become thick with a little 
more than half an hour's boiling, or with three 
or four separate boilings of eight or ten minutes 
each; if too much reduced it will candy instead 
of remaining liquid. 

In making Jams many cooks, after allowing 
the proper proportion of sugar, put the fruit 
into the preserving-pan without removing the 
stones or skins until after boiling, as the flavor 
is thought to be finer by adopting this method. 
Glass bottles are preferable to any other, as they 
allow inspection to detect incipient fermenta- 
tion, which may be stayed by re-boiling. 
Copper or brass preserving-pans are the best 
kind to use, but they require a great deal of 
care to keep clean ; the enameled are very nice 
and easily kept in order. Jams should be kept 
in a dry, cool place, and if properly made will 
only require a small round of writing-paper 
oiled, and laid on to fit, and tied down securely 
with a second paper brushed over with the white 
of egg to exclude the air. 

Plum Jam — Allow % lb. of white sugar to 1 
lb. of fruit. It is difficult to give the exact quan- 



Preserves. 231 

tity of sugar to be used in plum jam; in fact, it 
entirely depends upon the quality of the plums 
used; therefore your own judgment will be neces- 
sary. After weighing the plums halve them and 
remove the stones; then place on a large dish 
and sprinkle with the sugar; leave them thus for 
24 hours; then put into a preserving-pan and 
let them simmer gently on the back of the stove 
for about 25 or 30 minutes, then boil very 
quickly for ^ hour, skimming carefully, and 
stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent the jam 
sticking. It greatly improves the jam to put 
some kernels from the plum stones into it. 

To Preserve Fruit in Syrup — To every lb. 
of fruit allow 1 lb. of lump sugar, ^ tumbler of 
cold water. Boil the water and sugar together 
until it thickens slightly, which will take about 
3/2 hour if the sugar be good. Take off the scum 
as it rises. Add the fruit and boil for 3^ hour 
(rather longer if stone fruit), stirring very 
slightly, or the fruit will break. Take off the 
scum as it rises, but if both sugar and fruit be 
good there will be very little. Put into jars and 
tie over. 

N. B. — To keep well, fruit must be perfectly 
sound and dry when gathered. 

Currant Jam — Three-quarters of a lb. of 
white sugar to every pound of fruit. 

Let the fruit be very ripe, remove from the 
stalks with a silver fork ; dissolve the sugar over 
the fire, then put in the currants and boil for i^ 
hour, stirring and skimming all the time. Put 
into jars and cover air-tight. 

Raspberry Jam — Allow 1 lb. white sugar to 
1 lb. fruit, and 3^ cup red currant juice. 

Directly this fruit is purchased preserve it; if 
allowed to stand the jam and the flavor will not 
be so good; place in preserving-pan and allow to 



232 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

boil for 3^ hour. Be particular to skim well, as 
this will make the jam nice and clear. When 
done, place in pots and cover in the usual 
manner. 

Gooseberry Jam — Some fine full-grown, 
unripe gooseberries, their weight in sugar; to 1 
pint of liquor allow 1 lb. of sugar. 

Cut, and pick out the seeds of the goose- 
berries; put them into a pan of water, green, and 
put them into a sieve to drain; beat them in a 
marble mortar, with their weight in sugar. Boil 
a quart of them to a mash in a quart of water; 
squeeze, and add to the liquor sugar in the above 
proportions; then boil and skim it, put in your 
green gooseberries, and having boiled them till 
very thick, clear, and of a nice green, put them 
into bottles. 

Damson Jam — Equal quantities of fruit and 
jelly. 

Choose the fruit without blemish; remove the 
stones from the fruit, and put it and the sugar 
into your preserving-pan; stir slowly until the 
sugar is melted, and remove all scum. After the 
jam has begun to simmer, allow it to boil for an 
hour. It is necessary to stir diligently, or the 
jam will burn. When done, pot in the usual 
way. 

Tomato Preserves — Select small, green 
tomatoes, wipe carefully and prick the skins in 
several places. To ^ peck of these take 4 lbs. 
sugar, juice of 6 large lemons, and 2 oz. green 
ginger root and 1 of mace; put on the rest of 
the ingredients and let them boil ^ hour, skim- 
ming carefully; then put on the tomatoes and let 
them cook gently. When the tomatoes are clear' 
and can be pierced with a straw take them up 
and lay carefully on plates to cool, allowing the 
syrup to simmer on the back of the stove. Put 



Preserves. 233 

the tomatoes into jars, pour over the syrup and 
seal. Small yellow tomatoes may be preserved 
in the same way. 

Tomato Jelly— One peck yellow tomatoes 
cut into pieces and boiled until soft; strain 
through a jelly bag; put on the fire and boil 20 
minutes; to every cup of juice measure one of 
sugar; set the sugar in the oven, being careful 
that it is only heated through, not scorched. At 
the end of the 20 minutes add the sugar and the 
juice of a dozen lemons which has been strained 
through your jelly bag; boil 15 minutes more, 
then pour into your jelly glasses. Have the 
glasses just washed in hot water and wiped dry, 
and put a teaspoon in each one as you are ready 
to fill it. This will prevent the hot liquid from 
breaking the glasses. 

(Juince Marmalade — Four lbs. peeled and 
thinly sliced quinces in 2 quarts acidulated water, 
2 lbs. peeled, cored and sliced apples, 3 lbs. 
sugar. 

Place the fruit on the fire to boil until soft; 
then add the sugar, and stir the marmalade with 
a clean wooden spoon over a brisk fire until re- 
duced to a rather thick paste — running rather 
slowly off the spoon when lifted out of the pan; 
the marmalade must then be immediately re- 
moved from the fire and poured into pots. 

Green Grape Jam— To 1 lb. grapes allow % 
lb. sugar. 

Pick the grapes carefully and reject any that 
are injured; wash them. Put the grapes into a 
preserving-pan, then a layer of sugar, then a 
layer of grapes. Boil on a moderate fire, stirring 
it all the time to prevent its burning, and as the 
grape stones rise take them out with a spoon, so 
that by the time the fruit is suflQciently boiled — 



234 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

about 1 hour — the stones will all have been taken 
out. Put into jars and cover in the usual way. 

Blackberry Jam — To every lb. of picked 
fruit allow 1 lb. loaf sugar and }4: ^b. apples 
peeled and cored and cut quite small. Boil the 
fruit for 10 minutes, add the sugar, boil, stir and 
remove all scum. It will take from 3^ to ^ of 
an hour. 

Strawl)erry Jam — To 1 lb. fruit allow % lb. 
or 1 lb. sugar; to 4 lbs. strawberries add 1 pint 
red currant juice. 

Put the currant juice and strawberries on to 
boil for 30 minutes, and stir carefully all the 
time; then put in the sugar and boil up very 
quickly for 20 or 25 minutes, removing any scum 
that arises; put into your jars, covering air- 
tight. If a pound of sugar is used there will be 
more jelly. 

Apple Marmalade — Pare, core and quarter 
some apples; put into a preserving-pan with suf- 
ficient water to prevent burning. Boil till it is 
a pulp. Take an equal weight of sugar in large 
lumps, dip in water and boil till it is a thick 
syrup; put it to the pulp, and simmer on a quick 
fire quarter of an hour. Grate in lemon-peel be- 
fore it is boiled. 

Apple Cheese — Dissolve 1 lb. sugar in }^ pint 
water; add IJ^ lbs. apples cut in quarters, and 
the rind of 1 lemon grated. Boil 3 hours; 10 
minutes before that time add the juice of the 
lemon; stir all the time after the lemon is added, 
and boil quickly. 

To Preserve Raspberries — To 1 lb. fruit, 
quite ripe, add 1 lb. finely-sifted sugar. Make 
the sugar as hot as possible without scorching, 
put it to the fruit, and stir till every particle of 
sugar is dissolved; put it in jars, and tie down 



Preserves. 235 

with bladder. It will keep for a year, and looks 
just like fresh raspberries crushed with sugar. 

Quince Jam — To 1 lb. quinces allow ^ lb. 
sugar. 

Peel and quarter the quinces, leaving the seeds 
in, as they readily impart their mucilage to the 
water and thus thicken the syrup. Put the fruit 
and sugar into a preserving-pan, and 3^ teacup- 
ful water to moisten the bottom of the pan; stir 
the fruit and sugar frequently, and when it boils 
keep it boiling rapidly until the fruit is soft and 
of a clear red color. It will take about an hour, 
reckoning from the first boiling-up. Put into 
jam pots, and cover when cold. 

Apple Jam — Allow to every pound of pared 
and cored fruit ^ lb. white sugar, the rind of 
1 lemon, and juice of 3^ lemon. 

Having peeled and cored the apples, weigh 
them, and slice them very thin. Place in a 
stone jar and surround with boiling water; 
allow them to boil until tender; when tender 
place in a preserving-pan, add the sugar, grated 
lemon and j uice. Boil slowly ^ hour from the 
time it begins to simmer, remove the scum, and 
put into jars and cover in the usual manner. 

(xreen Tig Preserves — Equal quantity of 
fruit and syrup, peel of 1 large lemon, a little 
ginger. 

Lay the figs in cold water for 24 hours, then 
simmer them till tender; put them again into 
cold water, and let them remain for two days, 
changing the water each day. If not quite soft, 
simmer again, and replace in cold water until 
next day. Take their weight in loaf sugar, and 
with % of it make a syrup, in which simmer 
the figs for 10 minutes. In 2 days take the 
third of the sugar, pound fine, and pour the 
syrup from the figs on it. Make a rich syrup 



236 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

•with the peel of the lemon and a little raw 
ginger, and boil the figs in it, then mix all together 
and put into large jam pots. The figs may 
be cut in half, if preferred, after they have sim- 
mered until soft. 

Preserred Pumpkins — Equal proportions 
of sugar and pumpkins, 1 gill lemon juice. 

Cut the pumpkin in two, peel and remove the 
seed, cut in pieces about the size of a 50-cent 
piece; after weighing place in a deep vessel in 
layers, first sprinkling a layer of sugar, then of 
pumpkin, and so on, until it is finished; now add 
the lemon juice and set aside for 3 days; now 
for every 3 lbs. of sugar add ^ a pint of water 
and boil until tender. Pour into a pan, setting 
aside for 6 days, pour off the syrup and boil till 
thick; skim and add the pumpkin while boiling; 
bottle in the usual manner. 

(Jiiinces Preserved Whole — Some ripe 
quinces; to every pint of water allow 3 lbs. 
white sugar. 

Pare the quinces and put them into the pre- 
serving pan,three- fourths covered with cold water 
(if they should float while the water is being 
poured on them, press them down with a plate 
until you have gauged the exact height of the 
water); take out the quinces, measure the water 
and add the sugar. Let this boil rapidly in the 
preserving-pan for 5 minutes, and then put in 
quinces. The syrup should not cover them at 
first, but when they are half cooked it will then 
amply cover the fruit. Boil the quinces rapidly, 
until soft enough for a knitting-needle to 
pierce them easily, which should be in an hour and 
a half, reckoning from the first boiling-up. Take 
the quinces out carefully, so as not to break them, 
and lay them on dishes to cool. Run the syrup 
through a jelly bag, or a piece of new flannel, 



Preserves. 237 

put in a gravy strainer; this frees it of all odd 
little bits that may boil from the outside of the 
quinces, and makes it clearer. Put the syrup 
back in the preserving-pan, and boil it rapidly 
until it vrill jelly when dropped on a plate; put 
the quinces into the boiling syrup, and let them 
simmer gently for 10 minutes. Place each 
quince carefully in wide-necked jars, .pour the 
hot syrup over them, and when cold cover in the 
usual way. 

Preserved Oranges— Any number of oranges, 
with rather more than their weight in sugar; 
allow rather more than ^ pint of water to each 
lb. sugar. 

Slightly grate and score the oranges round and 
round with a knife, but not very deeply. Put them 
into cold water for 3 days, changing the water 
twice each day. Tie them up in a cloth and boil 
them until they are quite soft, that is, soft 
enough to be penetrated by the head of a pin. 
While they are boiling place the sugar on the fire 
with the water; let it boil for a few minutes, then 
strain it through muslin. Put the oranges into 
the syrup and boil till it jellies and is of a yellow 
color. Try the syrup by putting some to cool; 
it should not be too stiff. The syrup need not 
cover the oranges completely, but they must be 
turned so that each part gets thoroughly done. 
Place the oranges in pots, cover with syrup, and 
tie down with paraffin e papers. This is an ex- 
cellent way of preserving oranges or shaddocks 
whole. Only they should be looked at now and 
then, and boiled up again in fresh syrup, if 
what they are in has become too hard, which, 
however, if they have been properly done, will not 
be the case. They form a nice dish for dessert, or 
for serving, filled with whipped cream or cus- 
tard, either cold or gently warmed through in the 
syrup in a stewpan. 



238 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

To Cover Preserves — Cut a round of thin 
paper the size of your jar, brush it over with 
white of egg, and place on the preserve egg down- 
wards. See that it lies flat so as to keep out the 
air. Cut a round of white cooking-paper rather 
larger than your jar. Snip round the edge. 
Brush well over with white of egg, place on 
your jar, and stick down the edges round the 
jar with a dry cloth. Let your jam be cold 
before done, and let the paper on the top dry 
well before putting away. 

Apple Marmalade — Some good cooking ap- 
ples, % lb. fruit, 3^ teacupfal water to 6 lbs. su- 
gar, a few cloves, cinnamon or lemon peel for 
flavor. 

Peel, core and thinly slice the apples (apples 
that cook to a smooth pulp easily) ; put the sugar 
in a preserving-pan (a tin or iron saucepan will 
turn them black) with the water; let it gradually 
melt, and boil it for 10 minutes; then put in the 
sliced apple, and a few cloves, cinnamon or 
lemon peel to flavor, if liked. Boil rapidly for 
an hour, skim well, and put in jam pots; it 
should be quite a smooth pulp, clear, and a bright 
amber color. Will keep good for 12 months. 

Orape Marmalade— Take 10 lbs. of nice ripe 
grapes and wash them carefully; squeeze the 
pulps into one dish and throw the skins into 
another, put the pulps through a colander to 
remove seeds, then put pulps and skins together 
with ^ lb. sugar to 1 lb. of fruit and cook 
thoroughly until jellied. 

Sweet Tomato Pickle— Three and ^ lbs. 
tomatoes, 1^ lbs. sugar, }£ oz. each of cinnamon, 
mace and cloves mixed, 1 pint vinegar. 

Peel and slice the tomatoes, sticking into them 
the cloves; put all together into a stewpan and 



Preserves. 239 

stew an hour. When done pack in glass jars, 
and pour the syrup over boiling hot. 

Sweet Peach Pickle — To 4 lbs. peaches 
allow 2 lbs. white sugar, ^ oz. each of mace, cin- 
namon and cloves mixed, and 1 pint of the best 
white vinegar. 

Pour scalding water over the peaches and re- 
move the skins with a butter knife; drop into 
cold water; stick four cloves in each peach. Lay 
the peaches in preserving-pan with the sugar 
sprinkled over them; bring gradually to the boil, 
add vinegar and spice, boil 5 or 6 minutes. Re- 
move the peaches and place in bottles. Boil the 
syrup thick and pour over boiling hot. 

How to Ice Fruit — Any desirable fruit may 
be iced by dipping first in the beaten white of 
an egg, then in pulverized sugar. Do this until 
the icing is sufficiently thick. Peaches should be 
pared and cut in halves, and sweet, juicy pears 
are treated in the same way. Cherries, strawber- 
ries and other small fruits are iced with the stems 
on, only the largest being chosen. Pineapples 
should be cut into thin slices and these again 
divided into quarters. Oranges and lemons 
should be carefully pared, and all the white skin 
removed. Lemons are cut into horizontal slices, 
and oranges are divided into quarters. 

Salted Peanuts — Buy one quart of unroasted 
peanuts, break the shells carefully to prevent 
crushing; then drop the nuts into very hot water 
and rub gently until the red skin is off. Dry 
carefully, lay on flat tin plates and pour melted 
butter over them — a couple of teaspoonfuls will 
suffice; then set in rather quick oven until a nice 
brown; then take up and sprinkle liberally with 
salt, tossing them so that both sides will receive 
a coat. 



6ANNED FRUITS, Etc. 

To Can Peaches — First prepare the syrup. 
For canned fruits, 1 quart granulated sugar to 2 
quarts water is the proper proportion; to be in- 
creased or lessened, according to the quantity of 
fruit to be canned, but always twice as much 
water as sugar. Use porcelain kettle, and, if 
possible, take care that it is kept solely for can- 
ning and preserving — nothing else. Have an- 
other porcelain kettle by the side of the first, for 
boiling water (about 3 quarts). Put the peaches, 
a few at a time, into a wire basket, such as is 
used to cook asparagus, etc. See that it is per- 
fectly clean and free from rust. Dip them, when 
in the basin, into a pail of boiling water for a 
moment, and transfer immediately into a pail 
of cold water. The skin will then at once peel 
off easily, if not allowed to harden by waiting. 
This, besides being a neat and expeditious way of 
peeling peaches, also saves the best part of the 
fruit, which is so badly wasted in the usual mode 
of paring fruit. As soon as peeled, halve and 
drop the peaches into boiling water, and let 
them simmer — not boil hard — till a stiver fork 
can be passed through them easily. Then lift 
each half out separately with a wire spoon and 
fill the can made ready for use; pour in all the 
boiling syrup which the jar will hold; leave it a 
moment for the fruit to shrink while filling the 
next jar; then add as much more boiling syrup 
as the jar will hold, and cover and screw down 
tightly immediately. Continue in this way, pre- 
paring and sealing one jar at a time, until all is 
done. If any syrup is left over, add to it the 
water in which the peaches were simmered, and 
a little more sugar; boil it down till it " ropes" 
from the spoon and you have a nice jelly, or, by 
adding some peaches or other fruit, a good dish 
of marmalade. Peaches or other fruit, good, 

240 



Canned Fruits, Etc. 241 

but not quite nice enough for canning, can be 
used in this way very economically. Peaches to 
be peeled as directed above should not be too 
green or too ripe, else, in the first place, the skin 
cannot be peeled off, or, if too ripe, the fruit 
will fall to pieces. 

Another Way — After peeling and halving as 
above directed, lay a clean towel or cloth in the 
bottom of a steamer over a kettle of boiling 
water and put the fruit on it, half filling the 
steamer. Cover tightly and let it steam while 
making the syrup. When this is ready, and the 
fruit steamed till a silver fork will pass through 
easily, dip each piece gently into the boiling 
syrup; then as gently place in the hot jar, and 
so continue till all have been thus scalded and 
put in the jar. Then fill ftdl with syrup, cover 
and seal immediately. While filling, be sure and 
keep the jars hot. 

Pears — The skin will not peel off so easily as 
that of peaches by dipping them in boiling 
water, but it will loosen or soften enough to be 
taken off with less waste of the fruit than if 
pared without scalding. Prepare the syrup and 
proceed as for peaches. They will require longer 
cooking; but as soon as a silver fork will pass 
through easily, they are done. Longer cooking 
destroys the flavor. 

Pineapples — Pare very carefully with a silver 
knife, as steel injures all fruit. With the sharp 
point of the knife dig out as neatly and with as 
little waste as possible all the " eyes " and black 
specks, then cut out each of the sections in 
which the "eyes" were, in solid pieces clear 
down to the core. By doing this all the real fruit 
is saved, leaving the core a hard, round, woody 
substance, but containing considerable juice. 

16 



242 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Take this core and wring it with the hands as one 
wrings a cloth, till all the juice is extracted, then 
throw it away. Put the juice thus saved into the 
syrup; let it boil up 5 minutes, skim till clear, 
then add fruit. Boil as short a time as possible, 
and have the flesh tender. The pineapple loses 
flavor by over-cooking more rapidly than any 
other fruit. Fill into well-heated jars, add all 
the syrup the jar will hold; cover and screw down 
as soon as possible. 

Plums — Plums should be wiped with a soft 
cloth or dusted, never washed. Have the syrup 
all ready, prick each plum with a silver fork to 
prevent the skin from bursting, and put them 
into the syrup. Boil from 8 to 10 minutes, judg- 
ing by the size of the fruit. Dip carefully into 
the hot jars, fill full, and screw on the cover 
immediately. Cherries may be put up in the 
same way. 

Strawberries (Canned) — Allow to each 1 lb. 
of fruit % lb. of sugar. 

Put berries and sugar into a large, flat dish and 
allow to stand about 3 hours, then draw off the 
juice and put into preserving-pan and allow to 
come to a boil, removing the scum as it rises; 
then put in the berries, and let them come to a 
boil. Put into warm bottles and seal quickly. 

Cherries (Canned) — To every 1 lb. of fruit 
3^ lb. of sugar, 3 gills of water. 

Put the sugar and water on the fire to heat, and 
as soon as it comes to a boil put in the cherries 
and allow them to scald for ^ hour; put into 
bottles boiling hot and seal. A few of the ker- 
nels put in to scald with the fruit impart a fine 
flavor. Note — Be sure to skim well. 

Preserved Crab Apples — Select large, fine 
crab apples, prick the skins in several places; 



Canned Fruits, Etc, 243 

put into yoor preserving-kettle ^ lb. of sugar to 
each pound of fruit and a cupful of water; let 
the syrup boil 20 minutes, skimming off the 
scum which rises to the top; then put in your 
fruit and cook gently until the apples can be 
pierced with a straw; then take them out and 
lay on plates; boil the juice 3^ hour longer; then 
put the fruit in jars, fill up with juice and seal. 

Fruit Jellies— The fruit should be placed in 
a jar, and the jar set in a stewpan of warm 
water, covered and allowed to boil until the fruit 
is broken; take a strong jelly bag and press a 
little of the fruit at a time, turning out each time 
the skins; allow 2 lbs. of sugar to 1 quart of 
juice, set on the stove to boil again. Many good 
cooks heat the sugar by placing in the oven and 
stirring now and then to prevent burning. When 
the juice begins to boil (watch that it does not 
boil over 25 minutes), then add the heated sugar; 
stir well and just bring to a boil, remove directly 
from the stove, dip the vessels to contain it in 
hot water, and set them upon a dish cloth wrung 
out of warm water, pouring the boiling liquid 
into them; cover in the usual manner. 

Rhubarb Jelly — Soak 2 oz. gelatine in a pint 
of water with }4 lb. best lump-sugar; well wash 
and slice about 2}4 lbs. of rhubarb of a nice 
bright color, put it into a stewpan to boil with a 
quart of water, leave it to get thoroughly stewed, 
but not long enough to let the juice get thick; 
strain the latter, and add 1}4 pints of it to the 
dissolved gelatine, with the whites and shells of 
3 eggs. Whisk it all quickly on the fire, pass it 
through the jelly-bag, and pour it into a mould 
and leave it to set. 

Orange and Tapioca Jelly — Soak 6 table- 
spoonfuls of tapioca for 3 hours in 2 cupfuls of 
salted water; set in hot water and boil, adding 4 



244 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

teaspoonfuls of sugar and a little boiling water if 
too thick. When like custard, add the juice of 1 
orange. Cover the bottom of the mould with 
sliced oranges, and when the jelly is cool pour it 
over the fruit. 

Quince Jelly — Ripe quinces, allowing 1 pint 
of water to each pound of fruit, ^ lb. of sugar 
to each pound of juice. 

Prepare the quinces and put them in water 
in the above proportions; simmer gently till the 
juice becomes colored, but only very pale; strain 
the juice through a jelly bag, but do not press 
the fruit; allow it to drain itself. Put the strained 
juice in a preserving-pan and boil 20 minutes; 
then stir in the sugar in the above proportions 
and stir over the fire for 20 minutes, taking off 
the scum, and pour into glasses to set. It should 
be rich in flavor, but pale and beautifully trans- 
parent. Long boiling injures the color. 

Raspberry Jelly — Ripe, carefully picked 
raspberries; allow ^ lb. of pounded sugar to 
every pound of fruit. 

Boil the raspberries for 10 minutes, strain and 
weigh the juice and add the sugar in the above 
proportions and boil for 15 or 20 minutes. Skim 
and stir well. 

Cherry Jelly — May dukes or Kentish cherries 
(allowing ^ pint of water to 1 lb. of fruit). 

Boil the cherries in the water, strain the juice 
and proceed as for raspberry jelly. 

Red Currant Jelly — Red currants; % lb. of 
sugar to 1 lb. of juice. 

Pick the fruit and simmer it in water for about 
an hour, or until the juice flows freely; strain, 
boii up the juice, add the sugar, and boil again, 
skimming and stirring well for 15 minutes. Put 
into small pots, and when cold and firm cover it. 



Canned Fruits, Etc. 245 

Black Currant Jelly — Make in the same 
way, but use a larger proportion of sugar. 

White Currant Jelly — Pick the fruit care- 
fully, weigh it, and put into the preserving-pan 
equal quantities of fruit and sugar. Boil quickly 
for 10 minutes, and strain the juice into the 
pots; when cold and stiff cover them. 

Blackberry Jelly — Make as directed for red 
currant, but use only 10 oz. of sugar to each 
pound of juice. The addition of a little lemon 
juice is an improvement. 

Barberry Jelly — Barberries, a little water, 
% lb. of sugar to every pound of juice. 

Take ripe barberries, carefully reject any 
spotted or decayed ones, wash, drain them and 
strip off the stalks. Boil with a very little water 
till quite tender, press out and strain the juice, 
boil up the juice, add the sugar, and boil for 10 
minutes, skimming and stirring as above. 

Green Gooseberry Jelly — Carefully picked 
gooseberries, allowing to each pound of fruit ^ 
pint of water; to every pound of juice allow 1 
lb. of white sifted sugar. 

Boil the fruit in the water, reduce to a pulp — 
it will take }^ hour — strain through a jelly- bag, 
weigh the sugar in the above proportions; boil 
up the juice quickly and add the sugar; boil till 
reduced to a jelly (about 20 minutes), skim and 
stir well; pour into pots. 

Red Gooseberry Jelly — Make it in the same 
way as the green, but ^ lb. of sugar will be suf- 
ficient for each pound of juice. In straining the 
juice be careful not to press the fruit. The 
surplus fruit, with the addition of some currant 
juice, can be made into common jam. 



246 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

Mixed Fruit Jelly — Fruit, strawberries, cur- 
rants, cherries, etc.; ^ lb. of sugar to each 
pound of juice. 

Take ripe fruit, strip off the stalks and remove 
the stones from the cherries, boil all together for 
J^ hour, strain the juice. Boil up the juice, add 
the sugar in the above proportions, stirring well 
till quite dissolved, boil again for 15 or 20 
minutes till it jellies, stirring frequently, and 
carefully removing all scnm as it rises. 

Quince Jelly — Ripe quinces; to every pound 
of quince allow 1 lb. of crushed sugar. 

Peel, cut up and core the quinces. Put them 
in sufficient cold water to cover them, and stew 
gently till soft, but not red. Strain the juice 
without pressure, boil the juice for 20 minutes, 
add the sugar and boil again till it jellies — about 
3^ hour — stir and skim well all the time. Strain 
it again through a napkin, or twice-folded mus- 
lin, pour into pots or moulds, and when cold 
cover it. The remainder of the fruit can be 
made into marmalade with ^ lb. sugar and 3^ 
lb. juicy apples to every pound of quinces, or it 
can be made into compotes or tarts. 

Quince and Apple Jelly — Equal quantities 
of quinces and apples; to every pound of juice 
allow ^ lb. white sugar. 

Stew the fruit separately till tender (the 
quinces will take longer), strain the juice, mix it 
and add the sugar. Proceed as in quince jelly. 

Apple Jelly — Some sound apples; allow ^ 
lb. sugar to each pound of juice. 

Peel, core and quarter the apples, and throw 
them into cold water as they are done; boil them 
till tender, then strain the juice from them 
through a fine sieve, and afterwards through a 
jelly bag — if necessary pass it through twice, 
as the juice should be quite clear; boil up the 



Canned Fruits, Etc, 247 

juice add the sugar, stir till melted, and boil for 
another 10 minutes; add the strained juice of a 
lemon to every 1)^ lbs. of juice just before it is 
finished. 

Apple Jelly (2) — One lb. moist sugar, 1 lb. 
apples, 1 lemon — the juice of the lemon to be 
used and the rind added, cut very fine. 

Boil the whole until it becomes a perfect jelly; 
let it stand in a mould till quite firm and cold, 
turn it out and stick it with almonds; set custard 
round. If for dessert, use a small plain mould. 

Orange Jelly — Put 1 package of gelatine to 
soak m 1 pint of cold water; when it is dissolved 
add 2 pints of boiling water and juice of % 
dozen oranges and 2 lemons, as well as 1 pound 
of sugar; when all is dissolved, strain through a 
jelly bag and set away to harden. Cider or other 
fruit juice may be substituted for the oranges 
and lemons. 

Sago Jelly — Two lbs. picked red currants, 1 
pint cold water, i^ lb. white sugar, a cupful of 
sago. 

Put the currants into the water and boil till 
soft, pass them through a sieve; put the juice to 
boil again with the sugar; when quite boiling 
add the sago, previously soaked in cold water; 
boil 20 minutes until quite transparent, put into 
a mould, and when cold turn out. Serve with 
or without custard around it. 

Currant Spong-e — Cover % box of gelatine 
with cold water and let soak }4 hour; pour over 
a pint of boiling water, add % pint of sugar and 
stir over the fire for 5 minutes. Pour in ^ pint 
of red currant juice, strain into a tin pan, set on 
ice until the mixture begins to thicken, beat to a 
froth, add the well-beaten whites of 4 eggs, mix, 
and pour into a mould to harden. Serve with 
whipped cream. 



DAIRY DISHES. 

GEEAT attention and cleanliness are re- 
quired in the management of a dairy. 
The cows should be regularly milked at 
an early hour, and their udders perfectly 
emptied. 

The quantity of milk depends on many 
causes; as the goodness, breed and health of 
the cow, the pasture, the length of time from 
calving, the having plenty of clean water in the 
field she feeds in, etc. A change of pasture 
will tend to increase it. 

When a calf is to be reared, it should be 
removed from the cow in ten days at the 
farthest. It should be removed in the morning 
and no food given to it till the following morn- 
ing, when, being extremely hungry, it will 
drink readily; feed it regularly morning and 
evening, and let the milk which is given to it 
be just warm; skimmed milk will be quite good 
enough. 

The milk when brought in should always be 
strained into the pans. The cans containing 
the recently drawn milk should be placed in 
water about 56° F., which should rise a little 
above the level of the milk; the animal heat is 
thus reduced to between 56 and 58° F., and 
the milk will keep sweet for thirty-six hours 
even in the hottest weather. This temperature 
allows the cream to rise with greater facility 
and with less admixture of other constituents 
than can be obtained in any other way. Some 
butter-makers allow the milk to stand for thirty- 
six hours; others say that twenty-four hours is 

248 



Dairy Dishes. 249 

sufficient for all the cream to rise. After the 
cream has risen it is to be removed by skimming, 
and after standing a suitable time is placed in 
the churn. The kind of churn generally pre- 
ferred by the best butter-makers is the common 
dash churn, made of white oak. Much depends 
upon the manner in which the operation is per- 
formed, even with the same churn. The motion 
should be steady and regular, not too quick 
nor too slow. The time occupied in churning 
12 or 15 gallons of cream should be from 40 to 
60 minutes. When removed from the churn, it 
should be thoroughly washed in cold water, 
using a ladle and not the hands. It should 
then be salted with about one-twentieth of its 
weight of the purest and finest salt, which 
should be thoroughly incorporated with it, by 
means of a butter- worker, or ladle, the hands 
being never allowed to touch the butter. Twelve 
hours afterwards another working should be 
performed and the butter packed in strong and 
perfectly tight white oak firkins. When filled 
they should be headed up and a strong brine 
poured in at the top. It should then be placed 
in a cool, well- ventilated cellar. 

Dr. Ure gives the following directions for 
curing butter, known as the Irish method: 
" Take one part of sugar, one part of nitre, and 
two of the best Spanish great salt, and rub them 
together into a fine powder. This composition 
is to be mixed thoroughly with the butter as 
soon as it is completely freed from the milk, in 
the proportion of 1 ounce to 16; and the butter 
thus prepared is to be pressed tight into the 



250 White Ribbon Cook Book, 

vessel prepared to receive it, so as to leave no 
vacuities. This butter does not taste well till 
it has stood at least a fortnight; it then has a 
rich, marrowy flavor that no other butter ever 
acquires." 

Preserving" Butter — Two lbs. of commoD 
salt, 1 lb. loaf-sugar, and 1 lb. saltpetre. Beat 
the whole well together, then to 14 lbs. of bnttei 
put 1 lb. of this mixture, work it well, and wheu 
cold and firm put it into glazed earthen vessels 
that will hold 14 lbs. each. Butter thus preserved 
becomes better by being kept, but it must be 
kept from the air, and securely covered down. If 
intended for winter use, add another ounce of 
the mixture to every pound of butter, and on the 
top of the pans lay enough salt to cover them 
with brine. 

Clouted Cream — In order to obtain this, the 
milk is suffered to stand in a vessel for 24 hours. 
It is then placed over a stove, or slow fire, and 
very gradually heated to an almost simmering 
state, below the boiling point. When this is 
accomplished (the first bubble having appeared), 
the milk is removed from the fire, and allowed to 
stand for 24 hours more. At the end of this time 
the cream will have arisen to the surface in a 
thick or clouted state, and is removed. In this 
state it is eaten as a luxury; but it is often con- 
verted into butter, which is done by stirring it 
briskly with the hand or a stick. The butter 
thus made, although more in quantity, is not 
equal in quality to that procured from the cream 
which has risen slowly and spontaneously; and 
in the largest and best dairies in the Vale of 
Honiton the cream is never clouted, except when 
intended for the table in that state. 



Dairy Dishes. 251 

Rennet — Take out the stomach of a calf just 
killed, and scour it well with salt and water, both 
inside and out; let it drain, and then sew it up 
with two large handfuls of salt in it, or keep it 
in the salt wet, and soak a piece in fresh water 
as it is required. 

Maitre d'Hotel Butter — Two oz. fresh but- 
ter, juice of 1 lemon, white sugar and salt to 
taste, parsley blanched, freed from moisture and 
finely minced. 

Put the butter in a basin with the other ingre- 
dients, incorporate the whole effectually and 
quickly, and put it by in a cool place until 
wanted. 

Butter (to serve as a little dish)— Roll but- 
ter in different forms, either like a pine, making 
the marks with a teaspoon, or in crimping roll- 
ers, work it through a colander, or scoop with a 
teaspoon, and mix it with grated beef tongue 
or anchovies. Make a wreath of curled parsley 
to garnish. 

Curled Butter — Procure a strong cloth, and 
secure it by two of its corners to a nail or hook 
in the wall; knot the remaining two corners, 
leaving a small space. Then place your butter 
into the cloth; twist firmly over your serving 
dish, and the butter will force its way between 
the knots in little curls or strings. Garnish with 
parsley and send to table. 

Daisy Butter — Two tablespoonfuls white 
sugar, yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, 2 tablespoon- 
fuls orange-flower water, }^ lb. fresh butter. 

Pound the yolks with the orange-flower water 
(in a mortar) to a smooth paste, then mix in the 
sugar and butter. Now place in a clean cloth, 
and force the mixture through by wringing. 
The butter will fall upon the dish in pieces ac- 
cording to the size of the holes in the cloth. 



252 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Melted Butter — Five oz. butter, 1 table- 
spoonful flour, 2 tablespoonfuls water, salt to 
taste. 

Put all the ingredients into a stew-pan, and 
stir one way over the fire until all the ingredients 
are well mixed. Allow it just to boil, and it is 
ready to serve. 

Cheese (to make) — Warm the milk till equal 
to new; but observe it must not be too hot; now 
add a sufiQciency of rennet to turn it, and cover 
it over; let it remain till well turned, then strike 
the curd well down with the skimming-dish, and 
let it separate, observing to keep it still covered. 
Put the vat over the tub, and fill it with curd, 
which must be squeezed close with the hand, and 
more is to be added as it sinks, and at length 
left about three inches above the edge of the 
vat. Before the vat is in this manner filled, the 
cheese cloth must be laid at the bottom of it, 
and, when full, drawn smoothly over on all sides. 
The curd should be salted in the tub after the 
whey is out. When everything is prepared as 
above directed, put a board under and over the 
vat, then place it in the press; let it remain 2 
hours, then turn it out, put on a fresh cheese 
cloth, and press it again 10 hours; then salt it 
all over, and turn it again into the vat; then 
press it again 24 hours. The vat should have 
several small holes in the bottom to let the whey 
run off. 

Cheese (to preserve sound) — Wash in warm 
whey, when you have any, wipe it once a month, 
and keep it on a rack. If you want to ripen it, 
a damp cellar will bring it forward. When a 
whole cheese is cut, the larger quantity should 
be spread with butter inside, and the outside 
wiped to preserve it. To keep those in daily use 
moist, let a clean cloth be wrung out from cold 



Dairy Dishes. 263 

water, and wrapped round them when carried 
from table. Dry cheese may be used to advantage 
to grate for serving with maccaroni. 

Cream Cheese — Put 5 quarts of strippings, 
that is, the last of the milk, into a pan with 2 
spoonfuls of rennet. When the curd is come, 
strike it down two or three times with the skim- 
ming-dish just to break it. Let it stand 2 hours, 
then spread a cheese-cloth on a sieve, put the 
curd on it, and let the whey drain; break the 
curd a little with your hand, and put it into a 
vat with a 2-lb. weight upon it. Let it stand 12 
bours, take out, and bind a fillet round. Turn 
everyday till dry, from one board to another; 
cover them with nettles, or clean dockleaves, and 
put between two pewter plates to ripen. If the 
weather be warm, it will be ready in 3 weeks. 

Sage Cheese — Bruise some young red sage 
and spinach leaves, press out the juice, and mix 
it with the curd; then proceed as with other 
cheese. 

Cheese Straws — Six oz. flour, 4 oz. butter, 3 
oz. grated Parmesan cheese, a little cream, salt^ 
white pepper and cayenne. 

Roll it out thin, cut into narrow strips, bake 
in a moderate oven, and serve piled high and very 
bot and crisp. 

Roast Cheese — Three oz. Cheshire cheese^ 
yolks of 3 eggs, 4 oz. grated bread-crumbs, 3 oz. 
butter, a dessertspoonful of mustard, salt and 
pepper. 

Grate the cheese, add the yolks, bread-crumbs 
and butter; beat the whole well in a mortar and 
add the mustard, salt and pepper. Make some 
toast cut into neat slices and spread the paste 
thickly on. Cover with a dish and place in the 
oven till hot through, then uncover and let the 
cheese color a light brown. Serve immediately* 



264 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Rainequins — Beat 2 eggs, whites and yolks 
separately; to the yolks of the eggs add 2 table- 
spoonfuls flour, 2 oz. melted butter and 2 oz. 
cheese, grated; to this add the stiff whites of the 
eggs. Mix well and bake in buttered gein-pans, 
in quick oven, about 15 minutes. Eat hot. 

Cheese Dish — Quarter lb. good, fresh cheese, 
1 cup sweet milk, 34 teaspoonful dry mustard, a 
little pepper and salt, 1 tablespoonful butter. 

Cut the cheese into thin slices, put it into a 
*'spider" or saucepan, and pour over it the milk; 
mix in the other ingredients. Stir this mixture 
all the time while over the fire. Turn the con- 
tents into a hot dish and serve immediately. 

Cheese Toast — Some rich cheese, pepper to 
"taste, a beaten egg, with sufficient milk to make 
it of the consistency of cream. 

Grate the cheese and mix with the other in- 
gredients; warm the mixture on the fire, and 
when quite hot pour it over some slices of hot 
buttered toast. Serve immediately. 



BEVERAGES 

THE making of tea depends upon the brand. 
Always scald the pot just as you make 
the tea. A general rule is : "One teaspoon- 
ful for each person and one for the pot." Pour 
on a little boiling water to wet the tea. A 
minute or two later add a cup or two of boiling 
water. Allow to stand and add what boiling 
water is necessary for the amount of tea de- 
sired. This develops the strength of the tea 
and keeps it hot. Oeylon tea must not wait 
more than five minutes, as after that it takes on 
an unpleasant taste. Make a little, and often. 

To make good coffee is the simplest and yet 
one of the most important things that pertain 
to cooking, but comparatively few know how to 
do it. For a family of five or six, take i cup 
good ground coffee and mix with it the white 
of 1 egg and a little water ; put it in the coffee- 
pot, and add to that about a pint of cold water. 
When it comes to a boil, set it on the back of 
the stove and add boiling water sufficient for 
use. This, with cream and sugar, makes most 
delicious coffee. 

Remember in making coffee : 

That the same flavor will not suit every taste, 
but that every one may be suited to a nicety by 
properly blending two or more kinds. 

That equal parts of Mocha, Java and Rio 
will be relished by a good many people. 

That a mild coffee can be made dangerously 
strong and still retain the mildness of flavor. 

That the enjoyment of a beverage and slavish 
devotion thereto are quite different things. 

255 



256 . White Ribbon Cook Book. 

That the flavor is improved if the liquid is 
turned from the dregs as soon as the proper 
strength has been obtained. 

That where the percolation method is used 
the coffee should be ground very fine or the 
strength will not be extracted. 

That if the ground coffee is put into the water 
and boiled, it should be rather coarse ; otherwise 
it will invariably be muddy. 

That a good coffee will always command a 
fair price, but that all high-priced coffees are 
not necessarily of high quality. 

That, in serving, the cups and cream should 
be warm; the cream should be put in the cup 
before the coffee is poured in, but it is imma- 
terial when the sugar is added. 

That a level teaspoonful of the ground coffee 
to each cup is the standing allowance, from 
which deviation can be made in either direction, 
according to the strength desired. 

Cocoa — Two tablespoonfiijjs cocoa, 1 breakfast 
cupfnl boiling milk and water. 

Put sufficient cold milk in to form the cocoa 
into a smooth paste. Now add equal propor- 
tions of boiling milk and boiling water, mixing 
well. Great care must be taken that the milk 
does not burn, or it will impart a disagreeable 
flavor. 

Chocolate — Allow 2 sticks of chocolate to 1 
pint of new milk. After the chocolate is scraped, 
either let it soak an hour or so, with a tabie- 
spoonful of milk to soften it, or boil it a few 
moments in 2 or 3 tablespoonfuls water; then, in 
either case, mash into a smooth paste. When 
the milk, sweetened to taste, is boiling, stir in 
the chocolate paste, adding a little of the boiling 



Beverages. 257 

milk to it first to dilute it evenly. Let it boil 
half a minute, stir it well and serve immediately. 

Ginger Beer — One and one-fourth lbs. loaf 
sugar, 1 lemon, 2 oz. best white ginger, 1 gallon 
boiling water, 1 tablespoonful German yeast, 
and ^ oz. cream of tartar. 

Peel the lemon; cut the inside in pieces. 
Crush the ginger, add the sugar and cream of 
tartar; pour over all the boiling water; stir well 
until the sugar is melted. Let it stand 24 hours 
to be quite cold, then stir in the yeast, which 
ought to be previously dissolved. Stir, and strain 
through a coarse cloth ; then bottle, taking care 
the corks are secured. Keep in a cool place in 
hot weather. 

Oatmeal Drink — (Dr.Parkes) — "The propor- 
tions are }^ lb. oatmeal to 2 or 3 quarts water, 
according to the heat of the day and the work 
and thirst; it should be well boiled, and then 1 
or 13^ oz. brown sugar added. If you find it 
thicker than you like, add 3 quarts water. Be- 
fore drinking it shake up the oatmeal well 
through the liquid. In summer drink this cold; 
in winter, hot. You will find it not only quenches 
thirst, but will give you more strength and en- 
durance than any other drink. If you cannot 
boil it, you can take a little oatmeal mixed with 
cold water and sugar, but this is not so good; 
always boil it if you can. If at any time you 
have to make a very long day, as in harvest, and 
cannot stop for meals, increase the oatmeal to 
}/2. lb., or even ^ lb., and the water to 3 quarts if 
you are likely to be very thirsty. If you cannot 
get oatmeal, wheat flour will do, but not quite so 
well." 

Those who try this recipe will find that they 
can get through more work than when using 
beer, and that they will be stronger and healthier 

17

at the end of the harvest. Cold tea and skim 
milk are also found to be better than beer, but 
not equal to the oatmeal drink. 

Lemonade (1) — Six large lemons and 1 lb. 
loaf sugar. 

Rub the sugar over the rinds to get out the 
flavor, then squeeze out all the juice on the 
sugar; cut what remains of the lemons into 
slices, and pour on them a quart of boiling 
water; when this has cooled, strain it onto the 
juice and sugar, and add as much more water 
(cold) as will make it palatable. 

Lemonade (2) — One oz. tartaric acid, 1 lb. loaf 
sugar, 1 pint boiling water, and 20 or 30 drops 
essence of lemon. 

To be kept in a bottle and mixed with cold 
■water, as desired. 

Lemon Syrup — Boil until clear 1 pint lemon 
juice, strained, and 3 lbs. loaf sugar, stirring 
constantly, and add }^ pint water to prevent its 
being too thick. The juice of a dozen lemons 
will give about a pint. 

To Keep Lemon Juice — Buy the fruit when 
cheap, when not quite ripe; cut off the peels, and 
roll the fruit in your hand, so as to make them 
part with the juice readily. Squeeze the juice 
into a china basin, strain through a muslin which 
will not allow the least pulp to pass. Have ready 
}£- and 3^-oz. phials (quite dry), fill with the 
juice so as to allow }4 teaspoonful sweet oil in 
each. Cork tightly, and set them upright in a 
cool place. When wanted for use, wind some 
clean cotton round a skewer, and, dipping it in, 
the oil will be attracted. The juice will be quite 
clear; the rinds can be dried for grating. 

Peppermint Cordial — One lb. loaf sugar, 1 
pint boiling water. 



Beverages. 259 

Simmer 10 minutes, then stir in 1 tablespoon- 
ful honey; whennearly cold, add 30 drops essence 
of peppermint. Bottle for use. Four table- 
spoonfuls to a tumbler of cold or hot water 
makes a delicious drink. Essence of ginger can 
be used in the same way. 

Raspberry Syrup — Fill a i^ -gallon fruit- jar 
with ripe red raspberries, pour over them good 
cider vinegar; cover tightly, and set away in a 
cool, dark place for a week. Put on the fire and 
let come to a scalding point, strain through a 
jelly bag; to the juice add pint for pint of 
sugar. Boil gently about 20 minutes, skimming 
constantly. Bottle, seal, and keep in a cool 
place. Add a wineglassful to a glass of iced 
water. It is excellent. 

Ginger Pop — Allow 4 quarts warm water, 1 
oz. white ginger root, 2 lemons, 1 lb. white sugar, 
3^ tablespoon cream tartar, and }4 ^^V soft 
yeast. Cut the ginger root fine and boil in a 
little of the water; grate in the yellow rind only 
of the lemons, and put in the pulp and juice; 
when nearly cold, add the yeast. Put all in a 
stone jar in a warm place 24 hours, then bottle 
for use. 

Currant Vinegar — Two quarts black cur- 
rants, 1 pint best vinegar, 1}^ lbs. white sugar. 

Well bruise the currants and place into a basin 
with the vinegar; let it stand 3 or 4 days, and 
then strain into an earthen jar; add the sugar, 
set the jar in a saucepan of cold water and boil 
for an hour. When cold, bottle; it is the better 
for keeping. 

Raspberry Tinegar — To 4 quarts red rasp- 
berries put enough vinegar to cover, 1 lb. sugar 
to every pint of juice. 



260 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Let the raspberries and vinegar stand for 24 
hours; scald and strain; add sugar, boil 20 min- 
utes, skim well, and when cold bottle. 

Koumiss — Put 1 gill buttermilk into a quart 
of new, rich milk, and add 4 lumps white sugar; 
see that the sugar is dissolved. Put in a covered 
vessel, in a warm place, for 10 hours; it will then 
be thick. Pour from one pitcher to another, so 
that it may become uniformly thick, then bottle 
and set away in a warm place. It will be good 
in 24 hours in summer and 36 in winter. The 
bottles must not only be tightly corked, but the 
corks tied down. Shake the bottles well before 
opening. This is an excellent drink for people 
with weak digestion, and is also good for chil- 
dren. 

Temperance Cnp — Pare the yellow rind very 
thinly from twelve lemons; squeeze the juice 
over it in an earthen bowl, and let it stand over 
night, if possible. Pare and slice thinly a very 
ripe pineapple, and let it lie over night in l^ lb. 
powdered sugar. If all these ingredients cannot 
be prepared the day before they are used, they 
must be done very early in the morning, because 
the juices of the fruit need to be incorporated 
with the sugar at least 12 hours before the bev- 
erage is used. After all the ingredients have 
been properly prepared, as above, strain off the 
juice, carefully pressing all of it out of the fruit; 
mix it with 2 lbs. powdered sugar and 3 quarts 
ice water, and stir it until the sugar is dissolved. 
Then strain it again through a muslin or bolting- 
cloth sieve, and put it on the ice or in a very cold 
place until it is wanted for use. 



SICK-ROOM COOKERY 

WITHIN the last few years great changes 
have occurred in the ideas entertained 
by the medical profession as to what is 
proper food for invalids. As a rule, patients 
are allowed to eat about what is desired, care 
being taken of course not to overload the 
stomach. There are cases, however, where there 
is little wish for food, and where the thought- 
ful nurse must look for something which is 
daintily appetizing as well as nourishing, and 
at the same time easy of digestion. To meet 
this want the recijDes below are given. 

Never set before the sick a large quantity of 
food ; tempt with a very small portion dehcately 
cooked and tastefully served. If not eaten 
directly, remove from the sick-room without 
delay, as no food should be allowed to stand 
there. Do not give the same food often, as 
variety is charming. Never keep the sick wait- 
ing; always have something in readiness — a 
little jelly, beef-tea, stewed fruit, gruel, etc. It 
will be found more tempting to serve any of 
these in glasses. If much milk is used, keep it 
on ice. Let all invalid cookery be simple; be 
careful to remove every particle of fat from broth 
or beef -tea before serving. 

Beef-Tea — Take l lb. lean beef, 1 pint water, 
and i^saltspoonful salt. 

Cut the meat into very small pieces, carefully 
removing the fat. Put into a stone jar with 
the salt and water; cover with the lid, and tie over 
a piece of thick brown paper. Put it into a 
moderate oven, simmer slowly for 4 hours, and 
strain. 

261 



262 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Beef- Tea Custard — This may be served alone, 
either hot or cold, or a few small pieces can be 
put in a cup of beef-tea, which is thus transferred 
into a kind of soupe royale. Beat up an egg in 
a cup, add a small pinch of salt, and enough strong 
beef-tea to half fill the cup; butter a tiny mould 
and pour in the mixture. Steam it for 20 min- 
utes, and turn it out in a shape. 

Mutton Broth — Cut in small pieces 1 lb. of 
lean mutton or lamb, and boil it, unsalted, in 1 
quart cold water, keeping it closely covered 
until it falls to pieces. Strain it and add 1 table- 
spoonful of rice or barley, soaked in a little warm 
water. Simmer for 3^ hour, stirring often, then 
add 4 tablespoonfuls milk, salt and pepper, 
and a little chopped parsley, if liked. Simmer 
again 5 minutes, taking care that it does not 
burn. Chicken broth may be prepared in the 
same way. Crack the bones well before putting 
them into the water. 

Veal Broth — One and 3^ lbs. veal, 1 doz. 
sweet almonds, 1 qt. water, a little salt, 1 pt. boil- 
ing water. 

Remove all the fat from the veal, and simmer 
gently in the water till it is reduced to a pint; 
blanch and pound the almonds till they are a 
smooth paste, then pour over them the boiling 
water very slowly, stirring it all the time till it is 
as smooth as milk; strain both the almond and 
veal liquors through a fine sieve and mix well 
together; add the salt, and boil up again. 

Chicken Broth —An old fowl, 3 pints water, 
a pinch of salt, a blade of mace, 6 or 8 pepper- 
corns, a very small chopped onion, a few sprigs 
sweet herbs. 

Cut up the fowl and pnt it, bones as well, in a 
saucepan with the water, salt, mace, peppercorns, 
onion and sweet herbs; let it simmer very gently 



Sicki'oom Cookery. 263 

till the meat is very tender, which will take about 
3 hours, skimming well during the time. Strain 
carefully and set aside to cool. 

Eg'g' Broth — An egg, 3^ pint good unflavored 
veal or mutton broth quite hot, salt, toast. 

Beat the egg well in a broth basin; when 
frothy add the broth, salt to taste, and servo with 
toast. 

Beef Broth — One lb. good lean beef, 2 quarts 
cold water, ^ teacup tapioca, a small piece of 
parsley, an onion, if liked, pepper and salt. 

Soak the tapioca 1 hour, cut in small pieces 
the beef, put in a stew pan the above proportion 
of water, boil slowly (keeping well covered) 1% 
hours, then add the tapioca, and boil 14 hour 
longer. Some add with the tapioca a small 
piece of parsley and a slice or two of onion. 
Strain before serving, seasoning slightly with 
pepper and salt. It is more strengthening to 
add, just before serving, a soft poached egg. 
Rice may be used instead of tapioca, straining 
the broth, and adding 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls of 
rice (soaked for a short time), and then boiling 
^ hour. 

Scotch Broth — The liquor in which a leg 
of mutton, piece of beef or old fowl has been 
boiled, barley, vegetables chopped small, a cup 
of rough oatmeal mixed in cold water, salt and 
pepper to taste. 

Add to the liquor some barley and vegetables, 
chopped small, in sufficient quantity to make 
the broth quite thick. The necessary vegetables 
are carrots, turnips, onions and cabbage, but 
any others may be added; old (not parched) peas 
and celery are good additions. When the 
vegetables are boiled tender add the oatmeal to 
the broth, salt and pepper to taste. This very 



264 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

plain preparation is genuine Scotch broth as 
served in Scotland; with any coloring or herbs, 
etc., added, it is not real Scotch broth. It is ex- 
tremely palatable and wholesome in its plain 
form. 

Broth (Beef, Mutton and Yeal) — Two lbs. 
lean beef, 1 lb. scrag of veal, 1 lb. scrag of mut- 
ton, some sweet herbs, 10 peppercorns, 5 quarts 
water, 1 onion. 

Put the meat, sweet herbs and peppercorns 
into a nice tin saucepan, with the water, and 
simmer till reduced to 3 quarts. Remove the fat 
when cold. Add the onion, if approved. 

Mutton Cutlets (Delicate) — Two or 3 small 
cutlets from the best end of a neck or loin of 
mutton, 1 cupful of water or broth, a little salt, 
and a few peppercorns. 

Trim the cutlets very nicely, cut off all the fat, 
place them in a flat dish with enough water or 
broth to cover them, add the salt and pepper- 
corns and allow them to stew gently for 2 hours, 
carefully skimming off every particle of fat 
which may rise to the top during the process. 
At the end of this time, provided the cutlets have 
not been allowed to boil fast, they will be found 
extremely tender. Turn them when half done. 

Rabbit (Stewed) — Two nice young rabbits, 
1 quart of milk, 1 tablespoonful of flour, a blade 
of mace, salt and pepper. 

Mix into a smooth paste the flour with }4 glass 
of milk, then add the rest of the milk; cut the 
rabbits up into convenient pieces; place in a 
stewpan with the other ingredients and simmer 
gently until perfectly tender. 

Meat Jelly (l) — Beef, isinglass, 1 teacupful 
of water, salt to taste. 

Cut some beef into very small pieces and 
carefully remove all the fat. Put it in an 



Sickroom Cookery. 265 

earthen jar with alternate layers of the best 
isinglass (it is more digestible than gelatine) 
until the jar is full. Then add a teacupfui 
of water with a little salt, cover it down closely. 
and cook it all day in a very slow oven. In the 
morning scald a jelly mould and strain the liquor 
into it. It will be quite clear, except at the 
bottom, where will be the brown sediment such 
as is in all beef tea, and it will turn out in a 
shape. It is, of course, intended to be eaten 
cold, and is very useful in cases where hot food 
is forbidden, or as a variety from the usual diet. 

Meat Jelly (2)— A calf's foot, 1}4 lbs. neck of 
veal or beef, a slice or two of lean ham, 1 small 
onion, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, 
a little spice, 3 quarts of water. 

Simmer slowly 5 or 6 hours, and strain. The 
above makes a strong but not highly flavored 
jelly. More ham or any bones of unboiled meat, 
game or poultry will improve it. The liquor in 
which chicken or veal has been boiled should, 
when at hand, be used instead of water. Meat 
jellies keep better when no vegetables are stewed 
in them. 

Baked Hominy — To a cupful of cold boiled 
hominy (small kind) allow 2 cups of milk, a 
heaping teaspoonful of white sugar, a little salt, 
and 3 eggs. 

Beat the eggs very light, yolks and whites 
separately. Work the yolks into the hominy, 
alternately with the butter. When thoroughly 
mixed, put in the sugar and salt, and go on 
beating while you soften the batter gradually 
with milk. Be careful to leave no lumps in the 
batter. Lastly, stir in the whites and bake in a 
buttered pudding-dish until light, firm and deli- 
cately browned. It may be used as a dessert. 



266 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

Strengthening Blanc-Mange — One pint 
milk, 3^ oz. isinglass, rind of i^ small lemon, 2 
oz. sugar, yolks of 3 fresh eggs. 

Dissolve the isinglass in the water, strain 
through muslin, put it again on the fire with the 
rind of the half lemon cut very thin, and the 
sugar; let it simmer gently until well flavored, 
then take out the lemon peel, and stir the milk 
to the beaten yolks of the eggs; pour the mix- 
ture back into the saucepan, and hold it over the 
fire, keeping it stirred until it begins to thicken; 
put it into a deep basin and keep it moved with 
a spoon until it is nearly cold, then pour it into 
the moulds, which have been laid in water, and 
set it in a cool place till firm. 

Milk Punch — One-half pint new milk and 1 
new-laid egg. 

Set the milk in a clean saucepan over a mod- 
erate fire; while it is heating beat the egg to a 
froth in a basin or a large cup. When the milk 
begins to bubble, skim off the froth as it forms, 
and pour it intc the whipped egg, quickly beat- 
ing the milk in; repeat until the egg is well mixed 
(without curdling) with about half the now boiled 
milk. Pour the remainder from the saucepan 
into the mixture in basin, and qaickly pour the 
whole back into the pan, then again into the 
basin, and so on until it is all frothy and well 
mixed. This cooks the eggs suflBciently. Add a 
pinch of salt, a lump or more of loaf-sugar, a few 
gratings of nutmeg or ginger according to taste, 
and serve in a tumbler, to be taken while hot. 
Foi cases of spasmodic pain from flatulency, or 
other cause, where brandy is often recommended, 
this is much safer to use. 

A Fever Drink (1) — A little tea sage, 2 sprigs 
of balm, a very small quantity of wood sorrel, a 
small lemon, 3 pints of boiling water. 



Sickroom Cookery. 267 

Put the sage, balm and wood sorrel into a stone 
jug, having previously washed and dried them, 
peel thin the lemon, and clear from the white; 
slice and put a piece of the peel in; then pour 
on the water, sweeten and cover. 

A Fever Drink (2) — One oz. pearl barley, 3 
pints water, 1 oz. sweet almonds, a piece of 
lemon peel, a little syrup of lemons and capil- 
laire. 

Wash well the barley; sift it twice, then add 
the water, sweet almonds beaten fine, and the 
lemon peel; boil till you have a smooth liquor, 
then add the syrup. 

Apple Water — Some well flavored apples, 3 
or 4 cloves, a strip of lemon peel, boiling water. 

Slice the apples into a large jug (they need be 
neither peeled nor cored). Add the cloves and 
lemon peel, and pour boiling water over. Let it 
stand a day. It will be drinkable in 12 hours or 
less. 

Currant Water — One quart red currants, 3^ 
pint raspberries, 2 quarts water; syrup — 1 quart 
of water, about ^ lb. of sugar. 

Put the fruit with the water over a very slow 
fire to draw the juice, for 3^ hour. They must 
not boil. Strain through a hard sieve and add 
syrup. Other fruits may be used in the same 
way. 

Sago Jelly — Boil a teacupful of sago in 4 
pints of water until quite thick; when. cold add a 
pint of raspberry juice pressed from fresh fruit, 
or half the quantity of raspberry syrup; add 
enough white sugar to sweeten to the taste, and 
boil fast for 5 minutes. Pour into the mould. 
Use a little cream with the jelly. 

Flax-Seed Lemonade — Into a covered vessel 
pour 1 quart of boiling water upon 4 tablespoon- 



268 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

fuls of flax-seed. Steep it for 3 hours, and then 
add the juice of 2 lemons and sweeten to the 
taste. If too thick, add cold water. Good for 
colds. 

Bread Panada — Toast to a light brown sev- 
eral slices of stale baker's bread. Pile them in 
a bowl with sugar and a litte salt sprinkled 
between them. Cover with boiling water; cover 
tightly and set into a pan of boiling water, 
letting it simmer gently until the contents of the 
bowl are like jelly. Eat while warm, with a 
little powdered sugar and nutmeg. 

Slippery-Elm Bark Tea — Break the bark 
into bits, pour boiling water over it, cover it 
closely and let it stand until cold. Put sugar 
and ice in for summer diseases, or add lemon 
juice for colds. 

Rice Milk — Two tablespoonfuls rice, 1 pint 
milk, 1 tablespoonful ground rice (if wanted 
thick, 2 will be required), a little cold milk. 

Put the rice into the pint of milk; boil it until 
done, stirring to prevent it burning. Put the 
ground rice with a little cold milk, mix smooth, 
and stir it in; boil for about 15 minutes. 

Thick Milk may be made in the same way as 
" rice milk," only substituting flour for rice, 
thickening and sweetening to taste. Five min- 
utes' boiling will do. 

Chamomile Tea — One oz. dried chamomile 
flowers, ^ oz. dried orange peel, 1 quart boiling 
water. 

Put the chamomile into a jug with the ora;nge 
peel. Pour over it the boiling water, and stand 
in the back of the stove, just close enough to the 
fire to keep it simmering till the strength of the 
peel and flower is drawn out; then strain off for 
use. 



Sickroom, Cookery, 269 

Dandelion Tea — Six or 8 dandelion roots, 
according to size, 1 pint boiling water. 

Pull up the dandelion roots and cut off the 
leaves; wash the roots well and scrape off a little 
of the skin. Cut them up into small pieces and 
pour the boiling water on them. Let stand all 
night; then strain through muslin. It should be 
quite clear and of a light brown color. About 
^ glassful should be taken at a time. This 
decoction should be made only in small quanti- 
ties, as it will keep fresh only two or three days. 

Jelly Water — Stir a tablespoonful of currant 
or other jelly into }^ pint water; keep it cold 
and give as occasion requires. Excellent in 
fevers. 

Toast Water — Toast a large slice of wheat 
bread so that it is a deep brown all over, but not 
blackened or burnt. Lay in a covered earthen- 
ware vessel, cover it with boiling water, and let 
it steep until cold. Strain it and add a little 
lemon juice, unless forbidden by the physician. 

FOR CHILDREN. 

For Diarrhoea — If the child has symptoms 
of diarrhoea or summer complaint, take the caul 
of mutton or lamb, and simmer in a pint of wa- 
ter, dusting in a little flour and a little salt. This 
soup is nutritious, and allays the irritation of the 
bowels. 

Arrowroot, made quite thin, with a teaspoon- 
ful of sweet cream, is nutritious and harmless. 
Do not make the food for infants too rich. 

Milli Porridge — Take 1 spoonful of Indian 
meal, and 1 of white flour; wet to a paste with 
cold water; put the paste into 2 cups of boiling 
■water, and boil 20 minutes; add 2 cups of milk 



270 White Ribbon Cook Book. 

and a pinch of salt, and cook 10 minutes more, 
stirring often. Eat with sugar and milk stirred 
in while hot. 

For Teetlling" — Tie a teacup of flour closely 
in a cloth, and boil for 1 hour. When cold, grate 
fine — enough to thicken a pint of half milk 
and half water the consistence of porridge. Add 
a litte salt. 

Barley Water — Pick over and wash 3 table- 
spoonfuls of pearl barley; soak it 3^ hour in 
a very little lukewarm water, and stir, without 
draining, into 2 cupfuls of boiling water, salted 
a very little. Simmer 1 hour, stirring often. 
Strain, and add 2 teaspoonfuls white sugar. When 
milk disagrees with infants, barley water can 
often be used.
