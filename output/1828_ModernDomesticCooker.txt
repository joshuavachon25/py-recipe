PREFACE. 



»» 



As there is scarce an individual who is not aware 
of the comfort resulting irom a regular and cleanly 
meal, it may appear to many labour lost, to write a 
preface to a work which is designed to teach us how 
to prepare such a repast. 

But, in the daily progress of life, we may often dis- 
cover an amiable and accomplished woman, who pos- 
sesses a general knowledge, with the exception of 
domestic cookery, which, I must be sulSered to remark, 
is a subject of infinitely greater importance to her than 
superficial acquirements, whether we consider her as 
a daughter, wife, or mother. Indeed, she can never 
be properly the mistress of a family, unless she makes 
herself acquainted with its interior economy. 

Exclusive of the necessity of such knowledge, it is 
surprising, how much such a woman, possessed of it, 
may save in the yearly expenditure of her family, 
which, in the present times, is an object of material 
importance to all persons of moderate incomes, for 
whom this book is peculiarly adapted, combining eco- 
nomy and gentility in its receipts and directions. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

FOR TBB 

MANAGEMENT OF A FAMILY. 



All persons should endeavour to discharge the duties of the sta- 
tion they may fill, so as to claim the respect of their compeers ; ;ind 
afford a beneficial example to the younger branches of society : to 
such as are desirous of respect, this mode of conduct is a matter of 
necessity, the neglect of wluch no excuse can extenuate. 

The accomplishments proper for the female character, are not so 
seriously attended to as formerly, when all persons, whatever might 
be their rank, were studious to render themselves useful* Tet do- 
mestic occupations should never for one moment be neglected, tm 
such neglect must produce misery, and may, peifaaps, ultimately ter- 
minate in rum. At no veiy distant period, ladies knew but little be- 
yond fbeir own fimiily concenis ; now, alas I there are few things 
of wfatcfa they know so little. Viewed either way, this is running into 
extremes, iddch should be carefully avoided, because elegant ac- 
qmrements may, with some Utile care, be easily united with useful 
knowledge, and without which they become ridiculous. That this 
may be done, we have numerous examples, even in the most ele- 
vated ranks of socie^, in which the mistress of a famOy, possessed of 
every possible feminine accomplishment, may be frequently seen 
superintending her family arrangements, investigating her accounts, 
instructing her servants, and keeping within the bounds of her hus- 
band's income ; by such means, reflecting credit on him, as well as 
herself. 

If such mmute'attention to domestic concerns reflects honour upon 
females of elevated rank, at the same time that it is useful to them, 
how much more flierefore must it be beneficial to such as posses^ 
contracted incomes, and who can only support an elegant, nay even a 
neat appearance, by exerting the most rigid economy, and attentive- 
ly directing their eflforts to the proper management of their doroestfc 
affairs. 

Females should be eariy taught to prefer the society of their homes, 
to engage fiiemselves in domestic duties, and to avoid every spedee 
of idle vanity, to which thousands of them owe their ruin ; and, above 
all things, to consider their parents as their best friends, who are in- 
terested only in their welfare ; then indeed we might hope to see all 



6 DIRECTIONS FOR 

ai it shotild be, and to have daily evidence of real comfort and hap- 
piness* Were females thus instructed, thej would soon learn to 
discriminate between the solid enjoyments of domestic peace, and 
the fleeting phantoms of delusive pleasure. 

It is natural to imagine, that when a female marries, she does so 
from a principal of love. It must surely, therefore, be admitted, that 
her duties then become still more seriously important, because her 
station is more responsible than it previously was. She will then 
have to superintend the affairs of the man with whose destiny she has 
united her own ; the domestic part of which falls particularly within 
the sphere of her management, and the duties of which she ought 
actively to execute, and at the same time to support as neat and 
elegant an appearance as is consistent with prudent economy ; with- 
out which even princely fortunes must fail ; in which case, her hus- 
band will soon discover her merits, and place a proper value on the 
treasure he possesses. 

A person who desires to please, will seldom fail to do so. This 
conviction should of itself be sufHcient to stimulate to the attempt, 
as domestic knowledge in a female is of more real importance than 
vain acquirements, not that accomplishments, when properly direct- 
• ed, are incompatible with domestic duties ; on the contrary, they 
become intimately combined with them, because they add to the ra- 
tional enjoyments of that home which should ever be the centre of 
attraction to the husband, to her children, and others connected with 
it ; and this is what an ignorant, unsocial, and unaccomplished woman 
^ can never render it It is the abuse of things from which alone 
mischief can originate, not from the temperate use of them. 

The domestic arrangements of a family belonging entirely to the 
female, the table, of couree, becomes entitled to no small share of 
her attention in respect to its expenditure, appearance, and general 
supplies. 

Taste and judgment are highly requisite in this department, be- 
cause the credit of keeping a good and respectable table depends 
not (as of old) on the vast quantity of articles with which it is cover- 
ed, but the neatness, propriety, and cleanliness, in which the whole b 
served up, which alone can confer real credit on her who directs the 
preparation. 

Dinner parties are very expensive, and certainly fall very heavy on 
persons whose incomes are moderate ; such persons, therefore, 
should not support a custom productive of unpleasant consequences, 
by lending it the sanction of their example. But if it is found requi- 
site occasionally to give dinners, it should be done in a liberal and 
genteel manner, otherwise it is far better to decline it altogether. 



DOMESTIC MANAGEMENT. 7 

- Diimeni are not bo sumptuous now as they formerly Mrere, whiefa 
may be accounted for from the increased price of provisions ; in con- 
sequence of which, persons who possess a moderate property are 
compelled to be as economical as possible, in order to support that 
genteel appearance necessary for the promotion of comfort. 

Tet a certain degree of caution is requisite in providing even a 
famOy dinner, as a casual visiter may unexpectedly enter, whose 
company cannot be avoided, and eveiy man feels his consequence 
hurt, should such a visiter chance to drop in to a dinner not suffi- 
ciently good or abundant; a table should therefore be fumiihdd 
according to the income and rank of its master ; thus I would not 
have a tradesman emulate the expenditure and appearance of a noble, 
nor a noble of royalty. A good plain dinner, of which there should 
foe sufficient, with clean linen and decent attendance, will obviate' 
every difficulty ; and the entrance of an unexpected visiter will occa- 
sion no additional trouble, and all uneasy sensations on account of 
the appearance of the dinner, will be banished from the breasts of 
the master and mistress, by which harmony and enjoyment will of 
course ensue. 

This mode of providing a table may be extended to every class of 
society, where each individual should have a table provided according 
to the fortune which must pay for it, and such an arrangement will 
meet with the respect and approbation of all serious persons. 

Carving also, though seldom attended to, merits attention ; for, 
without a due knowledge of it, the honours of a table cannot be per- 
formed with propriety, or without considerable pain. It also makes 
a great difference in the daily consumption of a family. I therefore 
recommend my readere to study this useful branch of domestic 
knowledge, which can be attained only by constant practice, as writ- 
ten instructions can merely point out the way which practice must 
render perfect, and without which no pereon can preside with honour 
at the head of a table. 

Where there are young persons in a family, it would greatly im- 
prove them, were they made to take the head of the table, under the 
superintendence of their parents, by whose salutary directions they 
would soon discharge the duty thus thrown upon them with equal 
ease and grace, and learn more in one month's practical employment, 
than they would in twelve months' observation. This would also 
prepare them to discharge their duties in a proper manner, when they 
become mistresses themselves. For my own part, I can imagine 
nothing more disagreeable than to behold a person at the head of a 
well-furnished table, presiding only to haggle and spoil the finest 
articles of provision, by which great waste is occasioned, and, we 



DIRECTIONS FOR 



WMytMf some disgust, because maiij delicate persens, wiieii help- 
ed in a clumsy 'maimer^ absolutdy loathe the provisioBs (honrerer 
good) thus set belore them. 

Ereiy hdy who fills the situation of amistress of a fiumdy, willy I 
am confident, upon matuie reflection, be coB?inced, that maeh d^ 
peods on the vigilance of her conduct, as far as respects good ma^ 
nagemeat and domestic economy ; the most trifling events should 
claim her notice, for the keen eye of a superior can alone restraia 
servants and dependants within proper bounds, and prevent that 
waste which would otherwise ensue* This is a line of conduct 
which the present price of every article of life renders still more im^ 
perative. No female should ever harbour a moment's doubt re* 
spectng her power to conduct uid manage a family, even if previous- 
ly unused to it, as many of her senior friends will fireely give her 
their advice, and a short pnetical experience will soon render her 
able to estimate the best mode of management, and also teach her 
how to keep her fiunily expenditure agreeable to her income, and 
how to lay ^ut her money to^the greatest advantage* To execute 
this in a proper manner, a strict account of the yearly income set 
apart for domestic expenses, should be carefully taken ; and that it 
may not be ignorandy exceeded, a minute account of the daily 
expenditure should be invariably made out, by which a regular habit 
of prudent economy will be obtained : and should the expenses of 
one week then exceed their bounds, it must be made up by retrench- 
ing on those of the following weeks. For where persons depend for 
their support and oomfort on the skiU and active exertions of a &ther» 
much also depends on the mother, who, should she be a bad ma- 
nager, will soon undo all that her husband has done ; but should she 
understand her duties, prosperity will smile upon the family, and 
peihaps fortune auty be ultimately secured* 

To prevent useless trouble in the household accounts, a Fakilt 
BooK-KEEPXR should be purchased, when the sums laid out will only 
require to be noted down, as die various articles are printed,, wifli a 
column for eveiy day in the year, by which means Ike exact expen- 
diture is always ascertained for any period in a few minutes. 

Persons who possess the means, should alwc^ pay for eveiy 
article in ready money, the benefit of which they will very soon ex- 
perience ; and tradesmen will be careful to supply such valuable 
oustomers with the best of their goods. They are also willing to 
seH their goods cheaper.for money than on credit, consequently, by 
properly attending to thb circumstance, a considerable saving may 
be made in the course of a year. I would also recommend my rea- 
ders never to change their trades^people without some serious cause

den 7<m » valuable cuatomery obeys your orders with punctuai 
attentioB, and urrariably serves you whh the best goods he can 
procure^ with the view of securing your future support, and arecom* 
mendation of his shop to your ftieiMb. 

On the contnury, those tradesmen who give long credit, are obli* 
ged to charge a proportional interest, without which they could not 
cany on their business ; and it is this arcumstance which contributes 
in no small degree to keep up the hi^ price of every necessary of 
life. You will therefore easily perceive that, by having long credit, 
you will lose money, respect, and comfort 

A person of moderate income should make every purchase herself, 
and to do this well, she should make herself acquainted with the best 
articles, and the relative value of each, by which she will occasion- 
ally make her pound go as far as many less active and experienced 
persons would two. Although 1 do not intend by the above to 
advocate the cause of bargains, which generally in the end prove 
losses i on the contrary I reconuoend whatever may be purchased to 
be of the best quality, which, you may rely on it, will go farthest 
Stated rules cannot be fully given, as rank, fortune, and habit, must 
determine many points; however, attentive inspection can be no 
disgrace even to the most elevated or wealthy. One great advantage 
resulting from this close attention b, that servants will soon discover 
that such a mistress must not be trifled with, and will consequently 
respect, fear, and serve her, better than they otherwise would do. 

Waste of every description should be cautiously avoided ; nothing 
can be more criminal, when we reflect that there are thousands of our 
fellow-creatures sufiering from want, while, by the bounty of Pro- 
vidence, we have the full enjoyment of every good thing. Waste- 
fulness, therefore, should never be tolerated in any of the necessaries 
. of life. Every respectable family, by proper attention, may do much 
good to their poor neighboura, without injury to tbemeelves, by 
properly preparing the ofial of dieir houses, and distributing it to such 
as are in want ; this would be aflbrding much actual relief at the 
expense of little more than trouble. 

Regularity should be punctuaUy observed in all families, as by 
keeping good houn mudi time is gained. By breakfasting early the 
servants have a fiadr day before them ; and they should, when con- 
venient, be sufiered to retire to rest at an eariy hour, by which means 
they will not be late on the following morning. 

This mediod will also render less servants necessary. I am sen- 
sible that many of my fair readers may imagine this to be of little 
consequence, but I can assure them that they will ultimMely find.

It is prudent and economical to have a saiBcieiiC qtialitity of house- 
hold articles and culinary utenailai The stods shodd ktvariably be 
well kept up, and to do this efibctnally, miiuirei^ sotne Consideration. 

The best| and indeed only regnkrmelfaod of doing tUs, is to keep 
a correct account of these, as wdl as different articles of household 
furniture, linen, plate, china, &c &C and the various articles should 
be occasionally examined, and every aitide replaced as soon as 
broken* 

Much time will also be saved, if every aitide is kept in its proper 
place, clean; and remember every fldng should be mended the 
moment it is injured, and never applUd to any other iiee ihan that for 
tohich it tMM origmaUy demgned, by which mode of management 
any thing will last much longer than it otherwise would do. 

What an active person may perform in the course of one year by 
a punctual attendance to regular hours, and a persevering industry, 
would, if calculated, astonish a common observer by its extent and 
utility* In respect to servants, a mistress should be extremely care- 
ful whom she hires, and be particular in procuring a good character 
from tiie persons with wbom they have previously resided. It is also 
the solemn duty of a mistresa, to be just in giving a character to 
such servants as leave her, because a servant's whole dependence 
rests entirely on the possession of a good character ; destitute of 
which, inevitable ruin must follow. This is a duty, the breach of 
which nothing can extenuate ; for by giving an undeserved bad 
character to a good servant, throu([^ caprice, eternal infiuny must be 
reflected on the person who does so. Faithful, honest servants 
should be treated with respect and kindness, and when an occasion 
offers, they should be duly rewarded, which will create emulation in 
others ; but never more kept than suffident 

Should you deal on credit, a book should be kept, in which every 
article, with its weight and price, should be inserted tiie instant it is 
received, which will prevent imposition, and also serve as a reference. 

In a well regulated fiunily, every article should be kept in con- 
stant readiness, such as broken sugar, pounded spices, &c. by which 
much trouble will be prevented when ^uch articles are wanted for 
immediate use. Servants should also be required to pay the same 
attention in waiting on the family, when alone, as they do when there 
is company: this will soon become a regular habit, and visiters will 
<Kscasion but littie additional trouble, while eveiy thing wiD appear to 
go on smoothly.

SOUPS and BROTHS. 

Al.& a pnq[)er mode is the first and most judicious 
step that oa^ be taken in the display of any subject, 
80 we dutU commence our work with a particular de- 
scription of the manner of making all kinds of Soups 
and Broths, those articles in the .Srt of Cookery being, 
at mcfftt eateartainments, whether of a public or private 
Mtore, fi]»t hroi^ht upon the table. 

To acquire reputation, and give satisfaction to those 
ibr whcMU any kind (tt provision is dressed, the first 
grand consideration of the cook should be a particu- 
lar attachment to cleanliness, and this more immedi- 
ately in the ^proper care of all vessels wherein such 
provision is to be dressed They must be kept pro- 
perly tkmed, and, as soon as possible after being used, 
weU cleaned, and placed, with their covers on, in 
some situation adapted fi)r the purpose. Previous to 
their being again used, examine them very strictly, 
and be carenilthat they are totally nree nx)m any kind 
of grmse, or any partides of Sana, which win be too 
1^ to secrete themselves in unobserved cavities of the 
vessels. To avoid this, rub the palm of yoiu- hand 
all round, with the ends of your fiingers in the cavities, 
-and if any sand is left, it ynSL stick to the flesh, which 
wiU Aatjorally draw it out. After this, wipe it all 
4wmd with a clean cloth, and you may be pretty well 
Mftisfied it is thoroughly cleansed for use. The pains 



12 S0UP8. 

yon have taken in tiiis first degree of care will be am- 
ply repaid by the articles yon cook being, if properly 
managed according to the rules here laid down, bronght 
to table in the highest state of perfection. 

As a necessary prelnde to the making of soups and 
broths, we shall introduce a few general observations ; 
which we recommend as deserving the particular 
notice and attention of the cook. 

When you make any kinds of soups, more especi- 
ally portable, vermicelli, or brown gravy soup, or, 
indeed, any other that hath roots or herbs in it, always 
observe to lay the meat at the bottom of your pan, 
with a good lump (rf'butter. Gut the herbs and roots 
small, lay them over the meat, cover it close, and set 
it over a slow fire : this wiU draw all the virtue out of 
the roots or herbs, turn it to a good gravy, and give 
the soup a different flavour firom what it wouM have 
on putting the water in at first. As soon as you find 
the gravy is newly dried up, then fiU the saucepan 
with water, and when it b^ins to bml skim off the fat, 
and pursue the directions given for the soup intended 
to be made. In making peas soup observe, that if 
they are old, you must use soft water; but if green, 
hard or spring water, as it will greatly contribute to 
the preservation of their colour. One principal thing 
to be observed m making all Knds of soup is, that no 
one ingredient is more powerful in the taste than an- 
other, but that all are as nearly as possible equal, and 
that the soup be relished in proportion to the purpose 
for which it is designed. 

Vermicelli Soup. 

Take a knuckle of veal and a scrag of mutton^ firom 
each of which cut the flesh into small pieces about the 
size of walnuts, and mix them together, with five or 
six thin slices of lean ham. Put into the bottom of 
your pan about four ounces of butter, and then your 
meat; to which add three or four blades of mace, two 
or three carrots, two parsnips, two large onions, with 
a dove stuck on both sides of each, cut in four or five 



80U7S. 13 

heads of celery wadied dean, a Imndi pf s^e^ herbs, 
eight or ten morels, and an anchovy. When your 
articles are thus prepared and mixed together in the 
pan, coyer it very dose, and set it ova: a slow fire, 
without any water, till the gravy is drawn out of the 
meat. When this is done, pour it out into a pot or 
large basin; then let the meat brown, (taking care that 
it does not bum,) and put into the saucepan tour quarts 
of water. Let the whole boil gently till it is wasted 
to three pints, then strain it, and mix with it the first 
gravy drawn fipom the meat. Set it on the fire, and 
add two ounces of vermicelli, a nice head of celery cut 
small, chyan pepper and salt to your taste, and let the 
whole boil about six minutes. Lay a small French 
roU in the soup dish, pour the soup upon it, strew 
some of the vermicelli on the surface, and then serve 
it to table. 

Vermicelli Soup White. 

Wash your vermicelli in boiling water, and leave 
it to drain on a sieve that it may not lump: boil It with 
some good gravy soup ; and the moment befi>re serving 
it up, put in a cullis a-la-reine, or the yolks of some 
beat up with cream or milk. It must not boil 
^r the ^gs are in, or else it will curdle. 

Soup CL-la-Reine* 

Take a knudde of veal, and three or four pounds 
of lean beef, to which put in six quarts of water, with 
a little salt. When it boils take off the scum quite 
dean, then put in six large onions, two carrots, a head 
or two of celery, a parsnip, one leek, and a little thyme. 
Let the whole stew together till the meat is quite 
boiled down, then strain it through a hair sieve, and 
after it has stood about half an hour, skim it well, and 
clear it off gently fix^m the settlings into a clean pan. 
Boil half a pint of cream, and pour it on the crumb of 
a small loaf till the whole is soaked in. Take half a 
pound of almonds, blanch and beat them as fine as 
possible, putting in now and then a httle cream to pre- 
vent them fit>m oiling. Then take the yolks of six 




^ 



14 novtn. 

haord eggs, beat diem wilii a loaf wi&ed in the cream, 
and mix the whole togetber. Put yoorbrolh hi again 
mto the sancepan, and when hot poor it to yonr al- 
monds. Strain it through a fine hair sieve, rabbing it 
with a spoon till all the virtue and flavour are extracted. 
Put the whole into the saucepan, adding a little mc»re 
cream to make it white. Set it over tiie fire, keep 
stirring it till it boils, and ddm off tiie fitidi as it rises. 
In the meantime soak the tops of two FrendiroDs in 
melted butter in a stew-pan till th^ are cri^, but not 
brown ; then take them out of the butter, and lay them 
hi a plate before the fire. After remaming there a short 
time put them at the bottom of the tureen, pouring to 
them a small quantity of the soup. When your soup 
has been thoroughly skimmed fix>m firoth, and is just 
ready to boil, then take it off, pour it into the tureen, 
and serve it hot to table. In making this soup, par- 
ticular care must be taken that no fat be on the surface 
of the broth at the time it is poured upon the almonds, 
otherwise the whole will be spoiled. 

Soup Creasy. 

Cut a pound of lean ham into small bits, and put 
at the bottom of a stew-pan, with a French roll cut in 
slices, and laid on the top. Take two dozen heads of 
celery cut small, six (mions, two turnips, one carrot, 
six cloves, four blades of mace, and two bunches of 
water cresses. Put them aU in a stew-pan, with a 
pint of good broth. Cover them dkise, and let them 
sweat gently for about twenty miwtes, after which fill 
it lap with veal broth, and stew it four hours. When 
this is done, strain it through a fine sieve or cloth, and 
put it agaip into the saucepan, seasoning it with salt 
and a Utde chyan pepper. As soon as it is simmered 
up, pour it mto the tureen, puttmg m some French roll 
toasted haatd. 

Transparent Soup. 

Cut off the meat fi*om a 1^ of veal as clean as you 
can, after which break the bone in small pieces. Put 
the meat into a large jug, with the bones at top, and 



add to it a bonch of sweet herb(9, a qmorter of an <niii^ 
of mace, half a pound of blanched alnumds, and pour 
in four quarts of boiling water. Set it over a slow fire, 
dose covered, and let it stand all night. The next 
day take it out of the jug, put it into a dean saucepan, 
and let it boil slowly tiU it is reduced to two quarts. 
During the time it boils be particularly careful to take 
off aU the scum and fat Strain it into a large bowl, 
and when you think the meat is perfectly settled at the 
bottom, so that no sediment can intermix with the 
soup, put it into a clean saucq>an, and intermix it with 
three or four ounces of boiled rice, or two ounces of 
vermicelli, which you like best. When it has boiled 
about a quarter of an hour, pour it into the tureen, and 
serve it to taUe. 

Jilmond Soup. 

Take a quart of almonds, and beat them in a marble 
mortar, witii the yolks of six hard ^gs, till they be- 
come a fine paste. Mix them by degrees with two 
quarts of new milk, a quart of cream, and a quarter of 
a potmd of double refined sugar, beat fine, and stir the 
whole well together. When it is properly mixed, set 
it over a slow fire, and keep it stirring quick till you 
find it of a good thidmess : tiiien take itoff, pour it into 
your dish, and serve it up. The principal care to be 
observed in making this soup is to prevent its curdling, 
which can only be done by keeping it constantly stir- 
ring till it boils. 

Soup Santif or Oravy Soup. 

Take a pound and a half of lean ham cut in slices, 
and put them in the bottom of the stew-pan, with 
about two ounces of butter under them. Over the

Rice Saupy or Potage du Ris. 

Take a handfiil of rice, or more, according to the 
quantity of soup you make; wash it well in warm wa- 
ter, rubbing it in your hands, and let it stand two hours 
and a half or three hours over a slow fire, with good 
beefandvealgravy: when it is done, season it to your 
palate, and serve it up. 

Scotch Barley Broth. 

Take a leg of bed* cut into piecev^, and boil it in 
three gallons of water, with a sliced carrot and a crust 
of bread. Lei it continue boiling till reduced to one 
half. Then strain it off, and put it again into the pot, 
with half a pound of barley, four or five heads of celery 
cut small, a bunch of sweet herbs, a large onion, a little 
parsley chopped small, and a few marigolds. When 
this has been boiled an hour, put in a large fowl, and 
let it continue boiling till the broth is quite good. Sea- 
son it with salt to your taste, take out the onion and 
sweet herbs, and send it to t^ble with the fowl in the 
middle. The fowl may be used or omitted, according 
to your own discretion, as the broth will be exceeding 
good without it. 

Instead of a leg of beef, some make this broth with 
a sheep's head, which must be chopped all to pieces. 
Others use thick flank of beef, in which case six pounds 
must be boiled in six quarts of water. Put in the 
barley with the meat, and boil it very gently for an 
hour," keeping it clear fix)m scum. Then put in the 
before-mentioned mgredients, with turnips and carrots 
clean scraped and pared, and cut into small pieces. 
Boil all together softly till you find the broth very good, 
and season it to your palate. Then take it up, pour 
the broth into your dish or tureen, put flie beef in the 
middle, witii carrots and turnips round the dish, and 
send it hot to table. This is a very comfortable repast, 
more particularly in cold and severe weather.

salt, nutmeg, and a little beaten mace. Put in a bit 
of butter about the size of an egg, with a spoonful or 
two of the soup strained, and set it 6ver the fire to be 
quite hot. Cut two French rolls into thin slices, and 
set them before the fire to crisp. Then take one of the 
hollow loaves which are made for oysters, and fill it 
with the minced fowl : close the roll as neat as possible, 
and keep it hot. Strain the soup through a very fine 
sieve into a clean saucepan, and let it stew till it is of 
the thickness of cream. Put the crisped bread into 
the dish or tureen, pour the soup over it, place the roll 
with the minced meat in the middle, and serve it up.

bay leaf; then add some more clear broth, and let it 
stew about an hour. While this is doing, take a cow 
heel, split it, and set it on to boil in some of the same 
broth. When it is very tender take it off, and set on 
a stew-pan with some crusts of bread, and some more 
broth, and let it soak eight or ten minutes. When 
the soup is stewed till it tastes rich, lay the (rusts in a 
tureen, and the two halves of the cow heel upon them. 
Then pour m the soup, season it to your palate, and 
serve it to table. 

White Soup. 

Take a knnekle of veal, a large fowl, and a pound 
of lean bacon: put these into a saucepan with six quarts 
of water: add half a pound of rice, two anchovies, a few 
peppercorns, a bundle of sweet herbs, two or three 
onions, and three or four heads of celery cut in slices. 
Stew them aU together, till the soup is as strong as 
you would have it, and then strain it through a hair 
sieve into a clean earthen pan. Let it stand all night, 
and the next day take off. the scum very dean, and 
pour the liquor into a stew-pan. Put in half apound 
of sweet almonds beat fine, b(d it for about a quarter 
of an hour, and strain it through a lawn sieve. Then 
put in a pint of cream, with the yolk of an egg, stir all 
together, let it boil a few minutes, then pour it into 
your tureen, and serve it up. 

Oravy Soup. 

Take a shin of beef, with the bone well chopped, 
and put it into your saucepan with six quarts of water, 
a pint of peas, and six onions. Set it over the fire, 
and let it boil gently till the juices of the meat are 
drawn out : then strain the liquor through a sieve, and 



80UPS.' 25 

add to it a quart of strong beef broth. Season it to 
your taste with pepper and salt, and put in a little 
celery and beet leaves ; and when it has boiled till the 
yegetiBLbles are tender, poor it into a tureen, and take 
it to table. 

Spring Soup. 

Take a pint of young peas, some chervil, sorrel, 
yoxuig green onions, spring carrots, and tomips, and 
stew them in some butter till tender ; when done, add 
what quantity of good brown gravy you wish ; season 
it with pepper, mace, and salt. Let the turnips and 
carrots be sliced, and be sure take o£f all the fat that 
rises upon the soup. 

Hare Soup. 

Cut a large hare into pieces, and put it into an 
earthen mug, with three blades of mace, two large 
onions, a little salt, a red-herring, half a dozen large 
morels, a pint of red wine, and three quarts of water. 
Bake it three hours in a quick oven, and then strain 
the liquor into a stew-pan. Have ready boiled four 
ounces of French barley, and put in ; just scald the 
liver, and rub it through a sieve with a wooden spoon ; 
pu]t it into the soup, set it over the fire, but do not let- 
it boU. Keep it stirring tiU it is on the brink of boil- 
ing, and then take it off. Put some crisped bread into 

your tureen, and pour the soup into it. This is a 

most delicious rich soup, and calculated for large enter- 
tainments. If any other kind of soup is provided, this 
should be placed at the bottom of the table. 

Partridge Soup, 

Take two large old partridges, skin them, and cut 
them into pieces, with three or four slices of ham, a 
little celery, and three large onions cut in slices. Fry 
them in butter till they are brown, but be sure you do 
not let them bum. Then put thenr into a stew-^pan, 
with three quarts of boiling water, a few peppercorns, 
and a little salt. Afler it has stewed gently for two 
hours, strain it through a sieve, put it again into your 

No. a. D 



stew-pan with flome stewed celery and fried bread. 
When it is near boiling, pour it into your tureen, and 
serve it up hot. 

Cray Fish Soup. 

Boil an hundred fresh cray fish, as also a fine lob- 
ster, and pick the meat clean out of each. Pound 
the shells of both in a mortar till tiiey are very fine, 
and boil them in four quarts of water with four pounds 
of mutton, a pint of green split peas nicely picked and 
washed, a large turnip, a catiot, an onion, mace, cloves, 
an anchovy, a littte thyme, pepper, and salt. Stew 
them on a slow fire till all the goodness is out of the 
mutton and shells : then strain it throng a sieve, and 
put in the meat of your cray fish and lo|>ster, but let 
them be cut into very small pieces, with the red coral 
of the lobster, if it has any. Boil it half an hour, and 
just before you serve it up, add a little butter melted 
thick and smooth : stir it round when you put it in, and 
let it simmer very gently about ten minutes. Fry a 
French roll nice and brown, lay it in the middle o[ the 
dish, pour the soup on iU and serve it up hot. 

Eel Soup. 

Takb a pound of eels, which will make a pint of 
good soup, or any greater weight, in proportion to the 
quantity of soup you intend to make. To every pound 
m eels put a quart of wat^, a crust of Ivead, two or 
three Ulades of mace, a littie whole pepper, an onion, 
and a bunch of sweet herbs. Cover tiiem dose, and 
let them boil till half the liquor is wasted : then strain 
it, and toast some bread ; cut it small, lay the bread in 
your dish» and pour in the soup. This soup is very bal- 
samic, md particulariy nutritious to weak constitutions. 

Oyster Soup. 

Takb a pound of skate, four or five flounders, and 
two eels ; cut them into pieces, just cover them witii 
water, and season with mace, an onion stuck with 
cloves, a head of celery, two parriey roots sliced, some 



aouP8« S7 

pepper and salt, and a bimch of sweet herbs. Cover 
them down dose, and after they have simmered about 
an hour and a half, strain the Uquor clear off, and put 
it into a clean saucepan. In the mean time take a 
quart of oysters, bearded, and beat them in a mortar 
with the yolks of six eggs boiled hard. Season it with 
peeper, salt, and grated nutm^ ; and when the liquor 
boils put all into it. Let the whole boil till it becomes 
of the thickness of cream, then take it off, pour it into 
your tureen, and serve it to table. 

Mutton Broth. 

Take a neck of mutton about six pounds, cut it in 
two, boil the scrag part in a gallon of water, skim it 
well, and then put in a small bundle of sweet herbs, an 
onion, and a good crust of bread. When the scrag 
has boiled about an hour, put in the other part of the 
mutton, and about a quarter of an hour before the meat 
is done, put in a turnip or two, some dried marigolds, 
a few chives, with parsley chopped small, and seasipn 
it with salt. You may at first put in a quarter of a 
pound of barley or rice, which both thickens and con- 
tributes a grateful flavour. Some like it thickened 
with oatmeal, and some with bread ; and, instead of 
sweet herbs and omons, season it with mace : butthis 
is a mere fancy, and determined by the different palates 
of different people. If you boil tcumips as sauoe to the 
meat, let it be done by themselves, otherwise the fla- 
vour, by being too powerful, will injure the broth. 

Beef Broth. 

Taks a leg of beef with the bone well cracked, 
wash it thoroughly dean, and pat it into your pot with 
a gallon of water. Scam it well, and put in two or 
three blades of mace, a small bunch of parsley, and a 
large crust of bread. Let it boil till the beef and 
sinews are quite tender. Cut some toasted bread 
and put into your tureen, then lay in the meat, and 
pour the soup all over. 



SB sours: 

Beef Drink. 

Take a pound and a half of lean beef, cut it into 
small pieces, and put it into a gallon of ^Cater, with the 
tinder crust of a penny loaf, and a little salt. Let it 
boil till it is reduced to two quarts, then strain it off, 
and it will be very good drink.— Observe, when you 
first put the meat into the water, that it is clear of all 
skin and fat. 

Strong Beef Broth to keep. 

Take part of a leg of beef, and the scrag end of a 
neck of mutton. Brec^ the bones well of each, and put 
to it as much water as will cover it, with a Uttle salt. 
When it boils skim it clean, and put to it a large onion 
stuck with cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, some pep- 
per, and a nutmeg quartered. Let these boU till the 
virtues of the mace are drawn out, then strain the soup 
through a fine sieve, and keep it for use. 

Veal Broth. 

Stew a knuckle of veal in about a gallon of water, 
put in two ounces of rice or vermicelli, a little salt, and 
a blade of mace. When the meat is thoroughly boiled, 
and the liquor reduced to about one half, it will be very 
good and fit for use. 

Chicken Broth. 

Skin a large old fowl, cut off the fat, break the 
fowl to pieces, and put it into two quarts of water, 
with a good crust olbread, and a blade of mace. Let 
it boil gently five or six hours : then pour off all the li- 
quor, put a quart more of boiling water to it, and cover 
it close ; let it boU softly till it is good, then strain it 
off, and season it with a little salt. In the meantime 
boil a chicken, and save the liquor ; and when the flesh 
is eat, take the bones, break them, and put them in the 
liquor in which you boiled the chicken, with a blade 
of mace, and a crust of bread. When the juice of the 
bones is extracted, strain it off, mix it with the other 
liquor, and send it to table. 



Spring Broth. 

Take a crost of bread, and about a quarter of a 
pound of fresh butter; put them into a soup-pot or 
stew-pan, with a good quantity of herbs, as bear, sor- 
rel, chervil, lettuce, leeks, and purslain, all washed 
clean, and coarsely chopped. Put to them a quart of 
water, and let them stew till it is reduced to one half, ' 
when it will be fit (or use. This is an excellent puri- 
fier of the blood. 

Plum Porridge to keep. 

Taks a leg and shin of beef, put them into eight 
gallons of water, and boil them till the meat is quite 
tender. When the broth is strong, strain it off, shake 
but the meat, and put the broth again into the pot. 
Slice six penny loaves thin, cutting off the tops and 
bottoms, put some of the liquor to them, cover them 
over, and let them soak for a quarter of an hour : then 
boil and strain it, and put it into your pot When the 
whole has boiled a short time, put in five pounds of 
stewed raisins of the sun, and two pounds of prunes. 
After it has boiled a quarter of an hour, put in five 
pounds of currants clean washed and picked. Let 
these boil till they swell, and then put in three quar- 
ters of an ounce of mace, half an oimce of cloves, and 
two nutmegs, aU beat fine. Before you put these into 
the pot, mix them with a little cold liquor, and put 
them in but a short time befi)re the whole is done. 
When you take off the pot, put in three pounds of 
sugar, a little salt, a quart oi sack, a quart of claret, 
and the juice of two. or three lemons. If you think 
proper, instead of bread, you may thicken it with sago. 
Pour yoijr porridge into earthen pans, and keep it for 
use. 

Mock Turtle Soup. 

Scald a calf's head with the skin on, and take off 
the homy part, which must be cut into pieces about 
two inches square. Let these be well washed and 
cleaned, tiben dry them in a cloth, and put them into a 
stew-pan, with wm quarts of water made as follows : 



90 80UFS. 

Take six or seven poitaids of beef, acalf 's JEbot, a ahaiik 
of ham, an onion, two carrots, a turnip, a head of ce- 
lery, some doves and whole pepper, a bimch of sweet 
herbs, a little lemon-peel, and a few truffles. Put 
these into eight quarts of water, and let it stew gently 
till the broth is reduced one half ; then strain it off, and 
put it into the stew-pan, with the homy parts of the 
oalf ^s head. Add some knotted marjorum, a little 
savory, thyme, and parsley, all chopped small together, 
with some cloves and mace pounded, a little chyan 
pepper, some green onions, a shalot cut fine, a few 
chopped mushrooms, and half a pint of Madeira wine. 
Stew all these together gently till the soup is reduced 
to two quarts ; then heat a little broth, mix some flour 
smooth in it, with the yolks of two eggs, and keep it 
stirring over a gentle m*e till it is near boiling* Add 
this to the soup, keeping it stirring as you pour it in, 
and let them all stew together for another hour. When 
you take it off the fire, squeeze in the juice of half a 
lemon, and half an orange, and throw in some boiled 
force-meat balls. Pour the whole into your tureoi, 
and serve it up hot to table. This is a rich soup, and 
to most palates deliciously gratifying. 

Portable Soup. 

This soup (which is particularly calculated for the 
use and convenience of traveUers, fix)m its not receiv- 
ing any injury by time,) must be made in the following 
manner. Cut into small pieces three large 1^ of veal, 
one of beef, and the lean part of a ham. Put a quar- 
ter of a pound of butter at the bottom of a lai^e cal- 
dron, then lay in the meat and bones, with four ounces 
of anchovies, and two ounces of mace. Cut off the 
green leaves of five or six heads of celery, wash the 
heads quite clean, cut them small, put them in with 
three large carrots cut thin, cover tiie caldron quite 
close, and set it over a moderate fire. When you find 
the gravy begins to draw, keep taking it up till you 
have got it all out; then put water in to cover the 
meat; set it on the fire Ugain, and let it boil gentiy for 



floups. 31 

fear hours; then strain it through a hair sieve into a 
dean pan, till it is reduced to one part out of three. 
Strain the gravy you draw from the meat into the pan, 
and let it boil gently till you find it of a dutinous con- 
sistence, observing to keep skimming off the fat clean 
as it rises. You must take particular care, when it is 
nearly enough, that it does not bum. Season it to your 
taste with chyan pepper, and pour it on flat earthen 
dishes a quarter ol an inch thick. Let !t stand till the 
next day, and then cut it out by round tins a little 
larger than a crown piece. Lay tiiie cakes in dishes, 
and set them in the sun to dry, to facilitate which turn 
tEem often. When the cakes are dry, put them into 
a tin box, with a piece of clean white paper between 
each, and keep them in a dry place. If made in frosty 
weather, it will be sooner formed in its proper solidity. 
This soup is not only particularly useful to travellers, 
but it is also exceeding convenient to be kept in private 
families ; for by putting one of the cakes into a sauce- 
pan, with about a pint of water, and a little salt, a 
basin of good broth may be had in a few minutes. 
There is also another great convenience in it; that by 
boilingasmaUquantityof water with one of the cakes, 
it will make an excellent gravy for roast turkeys and 
fowls.

SECT. L 

BUTCHER'S MEAT. 

AS a necessary prelude to the directions given under 
this head, we shall make a few necessary and general 
observations. All meat should be boiled as slow as 
possible, but in plenty of water, which will make it 
rise and look plump. Be carefid to keep it clear from 
scum, and let your pot be dose covered. If you boil 
it fast, the outside will be hardened before the inside is 
warm, and the meat will be disagreeably discoloured. 
A 1^ of veal of twelve pounds weight, will take three 
hours and a half boiling ; and the slower it boils the 
whiter and plumper it will be. 

With respect to mutton and beef, if they are rather 
under done, they may be ate without being either 
disagreeable or unwholesome; but lamb, pork, and 
veal, should be thoroughly done, otherwise, they will 
be obnoxious to the sight, and consequently ungrate- 
Ail to the palate. A leg of pork will take half an 
hour^s more boiUng than a leg of veal of the same 
weight ; but in general, when you boil beef and mut- 
ton, you may allow as many quarters of an hour as the 
meat weighs pounds. To put in the meat when the 
water is cold must be allowed to be the best method, 
as thereby the middle gets warm before the outside 
becomes hardened. Three quarters of an hour will 
boil a 1^ of lamb four pounds and a half weight. 
From these general directions, it would be unneces- 
sary to describe the usual mode of boiling the common 
joints of either mutton or beef We shall therefore 
proceed to those articles which require more particu- 
lar notice. 



BOILINQ mSAT, ^C. 33 

To dres$ a Calf ^8 Head, one half boiled, the other 

baked. 

After having weU cleansed the head, pa;rhoil one 
half, beat up the yolk of an egg, and rah it over the 
head with a feather ; then strew over it a seasoning 
of p^per, salt, thyme, pard^ chopped small, shred 
lemon-peel, grated brrad, and a little nntmeg ; stick 
bits of butter over it, and send it to the oven. Boil 
the other half white in a cloth, and pat them both into 
a dish. Boil the brains in a piece of dean cloth, with 
a yery little parsley, and a leaf or two of sage. YiThen 
they are boiled chop them small, and warm them np 
in a saucq>an, with a bit of batter, and a little pepper 
and salt. Lay the tonffae, boiled and peeled, in the 
middle of a smaU dish/and (he brains r^d it ; have 
in another dish, bacon orpickled pork; and in a third, 
greens and carrots. 

GrOM Lamb. 

Whatevsr the nomber of pounds is that the joint 
weig^, so many qoarters of an hour most it boi]. 
When done, serye it tqp with spinach, carrots, cab- 
bage, or brocoli. 

«/9 Ham. 

Put yoar ham into a copper of cold water, and when 
it boils take care that it boils slowly . A hamof twen- 
ty pounds weight will take four hours and a half boil- 
ing; and so in proportion fi>r one of a larger or smaller 
size. An old and large ham will require sixteen hours 
soaking in a large tub of soft water ; but a green o^e 
does not require any soaking. Be sure, while your ham 
is boiling, to keep tiie water clear from scum. When 
you take it up, pull off the i^kin, and rub it all oyer with 
an egg, strew on crumbs of bread, baste it with a little 
butter, and set it to the fire till it is of a light brown. 

Another Way of boiling a Ham. 

With respect to its being an old ham, or a green 
one, obserye the before-mentioned directions. Pare it 
round and underneath, taking care no rusty part is left. 
Put it into a pan or pot that wiH properly contain it.

oorer it with water, and put in a few iAorei^ tliyflie, 
and laurel leaves. Let it boil on a slow fire about five 
hours, and then add a glass of brandy, and a vmi of red 
vnne : fiiush boilingln the same manner* If it is tQ b^ 
served up hot, take off the skin, and tbraw it over with 
crumbs of bread, a little parley jbiely ebppped, and a 
few bits of butter, and give it a good whvx eithear in 
the oven, cnt with a. saliainander. If it ia to be kept 
oold, it vdll be better to lettlie skiii^ r^nuiin, aait wiU 
be a means of preserviojc; xta juicM. 

Ham a-la-Braise. 

Pare your ham roupd and widerneath,. taking care 
no rusty part is left; cover it. w?ll wi^ti meat under 
and over, with roots and spices, filling it up with water. 
The gravy that comes firom the ham being excellent 
for all kinds of brown sauces. 

If it be a dried tongoe, steep it aB light isk wtter ; 
but if it be a pickled onie, only wa^h it w^U frutti the 
brine. Let it boil moderately three hoor^* If it is to 
be eat hot, stick it with cloves, rub it over with the 
yolk of an egg, strew carumbled bread over it, and, 
when done, baste it with butter, and set it before the 
fire till it becomes of a light brown. Dish it up with 
a Uttle brown gravy, or red wine sauce^ and lay dices 
of currant jeUy round the disk, 

JVeafs Tongue, with Parsley, 

Boil it a quarter of an hour, then take it out, and 
lard it ; put it in airain to boil with any meat you have 
going onf when itk done, take (iie,$Idn off, cut almost 
hai^ through the middle lengthwi^ that it may open 
in two parts^ veithout the^eces coming apart, and 
serve it up with some gravy, pepper, and parsley shred 
fine. If you wish you may add a dash ol lemon-juice. 

Leg of Mutton, mth Cauliflowers and Spinach. 
Take a 1^ of mutton, cut venison fiishion, and boil 
it in a cloth. Boil two fine cauliflowers in milk and 



water, pufl thmn into sprigs^ and stew tibem witk bnt- 
ter, pepper, salt, and a little milk : stew some spinach 
in a saucepan, and put to it a quarter of a pint of 
grary, with a piece of buttar, and a little flour. When 
all is done, put the mutton in the middle of the dish, 
the spinach round it,' and the cauliflower over all. The 
butter the cauliflower was stewed in must be poured 
over it, and it must be made to appear like smooth 
cream. 

Lamb^s Head. 

Wash the head very clean, take the black part from 
the eyes, and the gall from the liver. Lay the h^ad 
in warm water ; boil the lights, heart, and part of the 
liver. Chop and flour them, and toss them up in a 
saucepan with some gravy, catchup, and a little pep- 
per, salt, lemon-juice, and a spoonnil of cream. Boil 
the head very white, lay it in the middle of the dish, 
and the minoe-meat round it. Place the other parts 
of the liver fried, with some very smaU bits of bacon 
on the mince-meat, and the brains fried in little cakes 
and laid on the rim of the dish, with some crimed pars- 
ley put between. Pour a Utile melted butter over the 
head, and garnish with lemon. 

Or you may dress it thus : 

Boil the head and pluck tender, but do not let the 
liver be too much done. Take the head up, hack it 
cross and cross with a knife, grate some nutmeg over 
it, and lay it m a dish before a good fire. Then grate 
some crumbs of bread, some sweet herbs rubbed, a 
Uttle lemon-peel chopped fine, a very httle pepper and 
salt, and baste it wi^ a Uttle butter ; then throw a 
little flour over it, and just as it is done do the same, 
baste and dredge it. Take half the livqr, tl^ heart, 
the lights, and tongte, chop them very small, with 
about a gill of gravy or water. First shake &ome flour 
over the meat, and stir it together, then put in the gravy 
or water a good piece of butter rolled in a Uttle flour, 
a littie pe|i^)ar and salt, and wli^t runs from the head 
in the dish. Simmer all together a few minutes, and 



36 BOILIKO 

add hsUlB, spomifbl of vMegar ; pour it into yoiar cusu, 
lay the head 'in the middle of the miBce-meat, have 
ready the other half of the liver cut thm with some 
slices of bacon broiled, and lay round the head. Gar- 
nish with lem7>n. 

Leg of Lamb bailed, and Loin fried. * 

Cut your leg from the loin, and boU it three quar- 
ters of an hour. Cut the loin in handsome steaks, 
beat them with a cleaver, and fiy them a good brown. 
Then stew them a little in strong gravy. Put your 
leg on the dish, and lay your steaks round it. Poxxr 
on your gravy, lay round lumps of staved spinadi 
and crisped parsley on every steak. Send it to table 
with gooseberry sauce in a boat, and garnish with lemon. 

A Haunch or JVecJc of Venison. 

Asa necessarv preparation for either of these joints, 
let it lie in salt tor a week; then boil it inadoth well 
floured, and allow a quarter of an hour^s boiling for 
every pound it weighs. For sauce, boil some cauli- 
flowers, pulled into little sprigs, in some milk and wa- 
ter, with some fine white cabbage, and turnips cut in 
dice; add some beet-root cut into narrow pieces aboirt 
an inch and a half long, and half an inch thick. Afl;er 
yom* cabbage is boiled, beat it up in a saucepan with 
a piece of butter and salt. When your meat is done, 
and laid in the dish, put the cabbage next the cauli- 
flower, and then the turnips. Place the beet-root here 
and there, according to your fancy ; and have a little 
melted butter in* a cup, in case it should be wanted. 
This dish is not only excellent in its quality, but par- 
ticularly pleasing in its loipearance. If any is lett;, it 
will eat well the next day, hashed with gravy and 
sweet sauce. 

Pickled Pork. 

After washing and scraping it perfectly dean, put 
it into the pot with the water cold, and when the rind 
feels tender, it is enough. The general sauce is greens, 
among the variety of which you are to make choice to 
your own direction*

Pig^s Pettitoes. 

Boil the feet till they are qtiite tender, but take up 
the heart, liver, and lights, when they have boiled ten 
minutes, and shred them , small. Then take out the 
feet and split them ; thicken your gravy with flour and 
butter, and put in vour mince-meat, a spoonful of 
white wine, a slice ot lemon, a little salt, and give it a 
gentle boil. Beat the yolk of an egg ; put to it two 
spoonsful of cream, and a little grated nutmeg. Then 
put in the pettitoes, and shake it over the fire till it is 
qpite hot, but do not let it boil. Put sippets into the 
dish, pour over the whole, and garnish with sliced 
lemon. 



SECT. II. • 

BOILING POULTRY. 

Turkejfs. 

A Turkey should not be dressed till three or feur 
days after being killed, as it will otherwise not boil 
white, neither will it eat tender. When you have 
plucked it, draw it at the rump, cut off the 1^, put the 
ends of the thighs into the body, and tie them with a 
string. Having cut off the head and neck, grate a pen- 
ny loaf, chop fine about a score of oysters, dtired a little 
iemon-peel, and put in a sufficient quantity of salt, pep- 
per, and nutmeg: ])f ix these up into a light fierce- 
meat, with a quarter of a pound of butter, ihree eggs, 
and a spoonful or two of a*eam. Stuff the craw of the 
turkey with one part of this composition ; the other 
must be made into balls, and boiled. When you have 
sewed up the tmrkey, and d^ged it with dour, put it 
into a kettle of cold wat^ ; cover it close, set it over 
the fire, and when the scum begins to rise, take it clean 
off, and then cover the kettle close. If a young one of 
a moderate siase, let it boil very slowly fi>r half an hour; 
then take off your kettle, and let it stand for some time 



38 BOiLiNa 

close covered, when the steam being conimed, will 
sufficiently do it. When you dish it up, pour a little 
of your oyster sauce over it, lay the force-meat balls 
round it, and serve it up with the rest of the sauce in 
a boat. Gariiish your djsh with barberries and lemon. 
The best sauces for a boiled tinrkey are, good oyster 
and celery sauce. Make the oyster sauce &U8 : Take 
a pint of 0}rsters, strain the liquor from them, and beard 
and wash them in cold water. Pour the liquor clear off 
into a stew-pan, and put in the oysters with a blade of 
mace, some butter rolled with flour, and a quarter of 
a lemon- When they boil up, put in half a pint of 
cream, and boil the whole gently together. Take the 
lemon and mace out ; squeeze the juice of the lemon 
into the sauce, and serve it up in your boats or basins. 
Make the celery sauce thus: Cut the white part 
of the belery into pieces about an inch in length, and 
boil it in some water till it is tender. Then take half 
a pint of veal broth and a blade of mace, and thicken 
it with a little flour and butter ; add half a pint of 
cream, and boil them gently together. Put in your 
celery, and when it boils, pour tiiem into your boats. 

Chickens. 

After you have drawn them, lay them in skimmed 
milk for two hours, and truss them. When you have 
properly singed, and dusted them with flour, cover 
them close in cold wat^, and set them over a slow fire. 
Having taken ofl* the scum, and boiled them slowly five 
or six minutes, take them ofl* the fire, and keep them 
close coveted for half an hour in the water, which will 
do them sufficiently, and make tbem plump and white. 
Before you dish them, set them on the fire to heat : 
then drain them and pour over them white sauce, which 
you must have made ready in the following manner : 

Take the heads and necks of the chickens, with a 
small bit of scrag of v6al, or any scraps of mutton yon 
may have by you, and put them into a saucepan, with 
a blade or two of mace, and a few black pe^^rcoms, 
an anchovy, a head of celery, a slice of the end c^ a 



POULTBT, ^C. 9 

lemon, and a bnndi of sweet herbs. Put to these a 
quart of water, cover it close, and let it boil till it is 
reduced to half a pint. Then strain it, and thicken it 
with a quarter oi a pound of butter mixed with flour, 
and boil it five or six minutes. Then put in two qooons- 
ful of mushrooms, and mix the yolks of two egg» with 
a tea<cup full of cream, and a little nutmeg grated. 
Put in your sauce, and keep shaking it over the fire till 
it is near boiling ; then pour it into your boats, aad 
serve it up witfi your chiek^is. 

Fowh. 

After having drawn your fowls, which you must 
be particularly careful in doing, cut off the head, neck, 
and legs. Skewer them with the ends of their legs in 
their bodies, and tie them round with a string. Singe 
and dust them well with flour, put them into cold wa- 
ter, cover the kettle close, and set it on the fire ; but 
take it off as soon as the scum begins to rise. Coyer 
them close again, and let them bofl gently twenty mi- 
nutes : then take them oS, and the heat of the water 
will do them sufficiently. Melted butter with pars- 
ley shred fine is the usual sauce, but you may serve 
them up with the like sauce as before directed fot 
chickens. 

Rabbits or Ducks. 

Boil yoor duck or rabbit in a good deal of water^ 
and when the scum rises take it clean off. A duck wlH 
take about twenty minutes, and a rabbit half an hour. 
Melted butter and parsley is firequeutly used as saujce 
for rabbits ; but if you prefer onion sauce, which wiU 
do for either, make it thus : Peel your onions, and 
throw them into water as you peel them ; then cut 
them into thin slices, boil them in milk and water, and 
scum the Kquor. About half an hour will boil them. 
When they are sufficiently boiled, put them into a cJean 
sieve to drain ; chop them, and rub them through a 
cullender ; then put them into a saucepan, and shake 
a little flour, with two (nt three spoonsful of cream, and 
a good piece of butter. Stew them all toget||ier till 



40 BOILING 

they are thick and fine ; lay the dack or rabhit in a 
dish, and pour the sauce aU oyer. If a rabbit, you 
must pluck out the jaw-bones, and stick one m each 
eye, the small end inwards. 

Another sauce for a boiled duck may be made thus : 
Take a large onion, a handful of parsley clean washed 
and picked, and a lettuce ; cut the onion small, chop 
the parsley fine, and put them iato a quarter of a pint 
of good gravy, with a spoonfid of lemon-|uice, and a 
little pepper and salt. When they have stewed to- 
getherhS^ an hour, add two spoonsful of red wine. 
Lay the duck in your dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

Pigeons. 

When you draw your pigeons, be careful to take 
out the craw as clean as possible. Wash them in se- 
veral waters, and having cut off the pinions turn their 
legs under their wings. Let them boil very slowly a 
quarter of an hour, and they will be sufficiently done. 
Dish them up, and pour over them good melted butter; 
lay round the dish a little brocoU, and serve them up 
with melted butter and parsley in boats. They should 
be boiled by themselves, and may be eaten with bacon, 
greens, spinach, or asparagus. 

Oeese. 

Singe a goose, and pour over it a quart of boiling 
milk. Let it continue in the milk all night, then take 
it out, and dry it well with a cloth. Cut an onion 
very small with some sage, put them into the goose^ 
sew it up at the neck and vent, and hang it up hj the 
legs till the next day ; then put it into ajpot of cold 
water, cover it close, and let it boil gently for an hour. 
Sctvc it up with onion sauce. 

Partridges. 

Boil them quick in a good deal of water, and fifteen 
mkiutes will be sufficient. For sauce, take a quarter 
of a pint of cream, and a bit of fi*esh butter about the 
size of a walnut. Stir it one way till it is melted, 
and then pour it over the birds. 



POULTET, ^C. 41 

PheasatUs. 

These must be likewise boiled in plenty of water. 
If it be a small one, half an hour will be sofficient, bnt 
if a large one, three quarters. For sauce, stew some 
heads Sf celery cut/ery fine, thickened with cream, 
and a small piece of butter rolled in flour, and season 
with salt to your palate. When your bird is done, 
pour the sauce over it, and garnish the dish with thin 
slices of lemon* 

Bnipes or Woodcocks. 

Snipbs or Woodcocks must be boiled in good 
strong broth, or beef gravy, which you must make as 
follows : Cut a pound of lean beef into smaU pieces, 
and put it hDito four quarts of water, with an onion, a 
bundle of sweet herbs, a blade or two of mace, six 
doves, and some whole pepper. Cover it dose, let it 
boil tiU it is half wasted, then strain it off, and put the 
gravy into a saucepan, with salt enough to season it. 
Draw the birds dean, but take particular care of the 
guts. Put the birds into the gravy, cpver them close, 
and ten minutes will boil them. In the meamime cut 
the guts and liver small, then take a little of the giyivy 
the birds are boilii^ in, and ste^ the guts in it with 
a blade of mace. Take about as much of the crumb 
of bread as the inside of a roll, and rub or grate i{ 
very small into a dean doth, then put into a pan 
with some butter, and fry it till crisp, and of a fine 
light brown colour. When your birds are ready, take 
about half »pint of the liquor they were boiled in, 
and add to the guts two spoonsful of red wine, and 
a piece of butter about the size of a walnut, rolled in 
flour. Set them on the fire, and shake your saucepan 
often, (but by no means stir it with a spoon,) till the 
butter is melted ; then put in the firied crumbs, give 
the saucepan another shake, take up your birds, lay 
them in the dish, and pour your sauce over them. 
Garnish with sliced lemon.

BOIUNG FISH. 

Turbot 

When you have thoroughly washed and cleansed 
your fish, rub some allegar over it, which will greatly 
contribute to its firmness. Put it in your fish-plate 
with the belly upwards, and fasten a cloth tight over 
it to prevent its breaking. Let it boil gently in hard 
water, with plenty of salt and vinegar, and scum it 
well, to prevent the skin being disccdoured. Be sore 
not to put in your fish till the water boils, and when 
it is enough, take it up, and drain it. Remove the 
cloth carefiilly, and sUp the fish very cautiously on 
the dish, for fear of breaking it. Lay over it oyster- 
patties, or fi-ied oysters. Put your, lobster or gravy 
sauce into boats, and garnish with crisped parsley and 
pibkles. 

Another Way to dress a Turhot. 

Put into the bottom of your stew-pan some thyme, 
parsley, sweet herbs, and an onion sliced. Then lay 
m ^our fish, and strew over it the like quantity of the 
same herbs, with some chives and sweet basil. Cover 
the fish with an equal quantity of white wine and the 
best vin^ar. Strew in a little bay salt with some 
Whole pepper. Set the stew-pan over a gentle fire, 
and gradually increase the heat till it is enough; 
when done, take it off the fire, but let the fish remain 
in the liquor, till you have made your sauce as fol- 
lows : Set a saucepan over the ^e, with a pound;of 
butter, two anchovies spht, boned, and wadied, twa 
large spoonsfiil of capers, cut small, some chives 
whole, a Uttle pepper and salt, some nutm^ grated,^ 
a little flour, a spoonfiil of vinegar, and a little' 
water.— Keep shaking it round for some time, and 
then put on the fish to make it quite hot. When both 
are done, put the turbot into a dish, pour some of the 
sauce over it, and the remainder into a boat. Garnish 
the dish with horse-radish. 



FISH. 4S 

Turbof en Mdigre. 

Put into yoxxr stew-pan a pint of water, a good Hi 
of salty some garlic, onions, all sorts of sweet herbs, 
and cloves ; toil the whole half an hoor over a slow 
fire. Let it settle. Pour it off clear, and strain it 
through a sieve ; then put in twice as much milk as 
brine, and put the fish in it over a slow fire, letting it 
simmer only. When vour turbot is done, you may 
serve it with any one of the following sauces : Ragout 
of e^ baUs, ragout of oysters, or trufHes, or mush- 
room, or a sauce hach^e. 

Salman. 

This is so substantial a fish, that it require^ to be 
well boiled. A piece not very thick wiU take half an 
hour. Boil horse-radish in ^e water. For sauce, 
melt some butter plain, and some other with anchovy. 
Garnish with horse-radish and sliced lemon. 

To dress a whole Salmon for a large Company. 

When* the salmon is scalded and gutted, take off 
the head and tail, cut the body throu^ into slices an 
inch and a half thick, and throw them into a large pan 
of pump water. When they are all put in, sprinkle 
a handtul of bay salt upon the water, stir it about, 
and then take out the fish. Set on a large deep stew- 
pan, boil the head and tail, but do not split the head, 
and put in some salt. When they have boiled ten 
minutes, skim the water very clean, and put in the 
sUces. When they are boiled enough, take them out, 
lay the head and tail in a dish, and the slices round. 
Serve it up with plain melted butter and anchovy sauce. 
Garnish with horse-radish, mixed with the slices. 

Cod's Head. 

Take out the gills and the blood, wash the whole 
very clean, rub over it a little salt, and a glass of alle- 
gar, and lay on your fish plate. When the water boOs, 
throw in a good handful of salt, with a glass of alle- 
gar. Then put in the fish, and let it boil gently half an 
hoar (if it is a large one, three quarters.) Take it up 



44 BOILING 

very carefully, and strip the fikin dean off, set it before 
a brisk fire, dredge it all over with floor, and baste it 
well with batter* When the fix)th begins to rise, 
throw over it some very fine white bread crumbs, and 
continue basting it to make it fix>th well. When it is 
of a fine light brown, dish it up, and garnish it with 
lemon cut in slices, scraped horse-radish, barberries, a 
few small fish fiied and laid round it, or fiied oysters. 
Cut the row and liver in slices, and lay it oVer a little 
of the lumpy part of the lobster out of llie sauce, which 
you must make as follows : Take a good lobster, and 
stick a skewer in the vent of the tail to keep out the 
water. Throw into the water a handfiil oi salt, and 
when it boils, put in the lobster, which will be done 
in half an hour. If it has spawn, pick them off, and 
poimd them very fine in the mortar. Put them into 
half a pound of good melted butter; then take the 
meat out of your lobster, break it in bits, and put that 
in likewise, with a large spoonfid of l^non-pickle, the 
same of walnut catchup, a slice of lemon, ofie or two 
slices of horse-radish, and a small quantity of beaten 
mace; season it to your taste with salt and chyan 
pepper. Boil them one minute, then take out the 
horse-radish and lemon, pour it into your sauce-boat, 
and serve it up with your fish. — If lobsters cannot be 
procured, you may make use of oysters or shrimps the 
same way ; and ii you cannot get any kind of shell fish, 
you may then add to the butter tivo anchovies cut 
Lall, a spooDfbl of walnut Uqnor. and an onion stack 
with cloves. 

Whole Cod. 

Put a large quantity of water into your fish-kettle, 
which must be of a proper size for the cod, with a 
quarter of a pint of vinegar, a handful of salt, and half 
a stick of horse-radish. Let these boil togeth^ for 
some time, and then put in the fish. When it is done 
enough (which will be known by feeling the fins, and 
the look of the fish) lay it to drain, put it in a hot fish* 
piate, and then in a warm dish, with the liver cut in 



PISH. 45 

half, and laid on eadi side. Serve it up with shrimp 
or oyster-sancey and garnish with scraped horse-radish. 

Salt Cod. 
Steep your salt fish in water all night, with a glass 
of vinegar thrown into it, with which take oat the salt ; 
and make it as mild as firesh fish. The next day boil it, 
and when it is enough, separate it in flakes into your 
dish. Then pour c^-sance over it, or parsnips boiled 
and beat fine with batter and cream. As it will soon 
grow cold, send it to table on a water plate. 

Cod Sounds. 

Boil your sounds well, but be carefid they are not 
done too much. Take them up, and let them stand till 
they are quite cc4d. Then make a forcemeat of chop- 
ped oysters, crumbs of bread, a lump of butter, the 
yolks of two eggs, nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and fill 
your sounds with it. Skewer Ihem in the shape of a 
turkey, and lard them down each side, as you would 
the breast of a turkey. Dust them well with flour, and 
putthem before the fire in a tin oven to roast. Baste 
them well with butter, and when enough, pour on them 
oyster-sauce, and garnish with barberries. This is a 
pretty side-dish for a large table; or very proper in 
the time of Lent. 

Soles. 

Take a pair of soles, skin and gut them. Then 
wash them thoroughly clean, and lay them in vinegar, 
salt and water, for two hours ; then dry them in a cloth, 
put them into a stew-pan with a pint of white wine, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion stuck with six 
cloves, some whole pepper, and a little salt. Cover 
them quite close, and when enough, take them up, 
lay them in your dish, strain the liquor, and thicken 
it with butter and flour. Pour the sauce over, and 
garnish with scraped horse-radish and lemon. You 
may add prawns, shrimp, or muscles to your sauce, 
according to the fancy ol those for whom you provide. 
This is a very good method ; but to make a variety, 
you may dress them as follows : 



46 Boii^mG 

Take two or three pair of middling sissed soles, ddn, 
gat, and wash them in roring water. Th^i put them 
on a dish, and pour halt a pint of white wine over 
them, torn them two or three times in it, and then 
pour it away. Cut off the heads and tails of the soles, 
and set on a stew-pan with a little rich fish broth ; 
put in an onion cut in pieces, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
pepper, salt, and a blade of mace. When these boil, 
put in the soles, and with them half a lemon cut in 
slices with the peel on. Let them simmer slowly for 
some time, then take out tbe sweet herbs, and put in 
a prat of strong white wine, and a piece of butter rol- 
led in flour. Let them all simmer together till the 
soles are enough. While the fish are doing, put in half 
a pint of veal gravy, and a quarter of a pint (^essence 
of ham, let it boil a little, then take up the soles, and 
pour this over them. Serve up sauce as before di- 
rected, and garnish your dish with sliced lemon and 
horse-radish. 

Trout. ♦ 

Boil them in vin^ar, water, and salt, with a piece 
of horse-radish ; and serve them up with anchoyy- 
sauce and plain butter. 

Pike. 

When you have taken out the giUs and guts, and 
thoroughly washed it, make a good forcemeat of chop- 
ped oysters, the crumb of half a penny loaf, a little 
lemon-peel shred fine, a lump of butter, the yolks of 
two eggs, a few sweet herbs, and season them to your 
taste with salt, pepper, and nutm^. Mix all these 
well together, and put them into the belly of the fish, 
which must be sewed up, and skewered round. Boil 
it in hard water with a little salt, and a tea-cup fiill of 
vinegar put into the pan. As soon as the water boils, 
put in the fish, (but not before,) and if it is of a middling 
size, it wiU be done in half an hour. Serve it up with 
oyster-sauce in a boat, having first poured a little on 
the fish. Garnish with pickted barberries. 



F18H« 47 

Carp. 

Whbn you kill year carp, eaave all the blood, and 
have ready some nice gravy, made of beef and mutton, 
seasoned with pepper, salt, mace, and onion. Before 
you put in your fish, straan it off, and boil your carp be- 
fore you put it into the gravy. Set it on a slow fire about 
a quarter of an hour, and thicken the sauce with a large 
piece of butter roUed in flour ; Or you may make your 
sauce thus : take the liver of the carp clean firom the 
guts, three anchovies, a little parsley, thyme, and an 
onion. Chop these small together, and take half a pint of 
Rhenish wine, four spoonsral of vinegar, and the blood 
of the carp. When all these are stewed gently together, 
put it to tiie carp, which must first be boiled in wa- 
ter with a httle salt and a pint of wine ; but take care 
not to do it too much after the carp is put into the sauce. 

Mullets. 

These must be boiled in salt and water. When 
they are enough, pour away part of the water, and put 
to the rest a pint of red wine, some salt and vinegar, 
two onions sliced, with a bunch of sweet herbs, some 
nutmeg, beaten mace, and the juice of a lemon. Boil 
these well together, with two or three anchovies. Then 
put in the fiish, and when they have simmered in it some 
time, put them into a dish, and strain the sauce over 
them. You may add shrimp or oyster-sauce according 
to your discretion. 

Mackard. 

Gut and wash them clean, then dry them in a cloth, 
and rub them gently over with vinegar. Lay them 
strait on your fish plate, and be very careful in handling 
them, as they are so tender a fish that they will easily 
break. When the water boils, put them into your fish- 
pan wil^ a little salt, and let them boil gently about a 
quarter of an hour. When you take them up, drain 
them well, and put the water that runs from them into 
a sauce-pan with one lai^ spoonful of catchup, a blade 
or two oimace^ an anchovy, and a slice of lemon. Ijft 



> 



48 BOILING 

these all bofl together about a quarter of an hour, then 
strain it throng a hair sieve, and thicken it with floor 
and butter. Put this sauce in one boat, and melted but^ 
ter and parsley in another. Dish up your fish with their 
tails in the middle ; and garnish with scraped horse- 
radish and barberries. Mackarel may be served with 
melted butter and a little fennel, cut fine, mixed with 
scalded gooseberries ; also with sweet herbs, cut fine, 
in melted butter, with a Uttle anchovy essence. 

Mackarel a-la Bourgeois. 

Split them open, put pepper, salt, mace, parsley, 
shalots, and bread crumbs, with some butter on them. 
You may either firy or send them to the oven. Serve 
them up with plain melted butter. 

Herrings. 

Scale, gut, and wash them, then dry them tho- 
roughly in a cloth, and rub them over with a little salt 
and vin^ar. Skewer their tails in their mouths, and 
lay them on your fish plate. When the water boils, put 
them in, and about ten or twelve minutes will do them. 
After you have taken them up, let them drain properly, 
and then turn their heads into the middle of the di^. 
Serve them up with melted butter and parsley, and gar- 
nish with scraped horse-radish. 

Flounders, Plaice, and Dabs. 

As the similarity of these fish is so great, the me- 
thod of dressing either must be the same. First cut off 
the fins, nick the brown side under the head, and take 
out the guts. Then dry them with a cloth, and boil 
them in salt and water. Serve them up with shrimp, 
cockle, or muscle sauce, and garnish with red cabbage. 

Perch. 

Put your fish into the water when it boils, with some 
salt, an onion cut in slices, some parsley, and as much 
milk as will turn the water. When the fish is enough, 
put it into a soup-dish, and pour a little of the water 
with the parsley and onions over it Serve it up with 
mdted butter and parsley ixx a boat 



fisn. 49 

Eeh. 

After skinning, gutting, and properly washing 
them, cut off their heads, dry them, and twist them 
round on your fish plate. Boil them in salt and water, 
and serve them up with melted butter and parsley. If 
you only boil them in such a quantity of water as will 
just cover them, the liquor will be exceeding good, and 
very beneficial to weak or consumptive constitutions. 

Sturgeon. 

Whe If you have cleaned your fish prop^ly, prepare 
as much liquor as will boil it in the following manner : 
To two quarts of water put a pint of vin^ar, a stick 
of horse-radish, two or three bits of lemon-peel, some 
whole pepper, a bay-leaf, and a small quantity of salt. 
Boil your fish in this liqnor, and when enough (which 
you will know by the flesh appearing likely to sepa- 
rate firom the bones) take it up, and have ready the 
following sauce : Melt a pound of butter, dissolve an 
anchovy in it, put in a blade or two of mace, bruise the 
body of a crab in the butter, a few shrimps or cray-fish, 
a little catchup, and a little lemon-juice. When it 
boils, take up the sturgeon, drain it well, lay it in your 
dish, and serve it up with the sauce poured into boat^. 
Garnish with fiied oysters, sliced lemon, and scjraped 
horse-radish. 

Turtles. 

These animals not only fiirnish the most delicious 
repast to the epicure, but to all those who can obtain 
so luxurious a gratification. They are of various sizes, 
and that the reader may be informed how to dress 
them, we shall here connne ourselves to one of about 
eighty pounds weight. Take the turtle out of th6 wa- 
ter the night before you intend to dress it. In the 
morning cut its throat, or the head off, and let it bleed 
for some time. Then cut off the fins ; scald, scale, and 
trim them and the head, and raise the callipee, which is 
tiie belly or under shdl ; clean it well, leaving to it as 
much meat as you conveniently can. Take firom the 
1>ack shell all the meat and entrails, except the rnoti*

sienr, which is the fat, and looks green : this most also 
be baked with the shell. Wash all clean with salt 
and water, and cut it into pieces of a moderate size. 
Take it from the bones, and put them with the iins 
and head into a soup-pot, with a gallon of water, some 
salt, and two blades of mace. When it boils, skim it 
dean, and put in it a bunch of thyme, parsley, savory, 
and young onions, and your veal pai*t, except about one 
poimd and a half, which must be made forcemeat of, as 
for Scotch collops, adding a little chyan pepper. When 
the veal is boiled in the soup about an hour, take it 
out, cut it into pieces, and put to the other part. The 
guts, which are considered as the best part, must be 
split open, scraped, and made clean, and cut into pieces 
about two inches long. Scald and skin the paunch or 
maw, and cut it like the other parts : mix them with 
the guts and other parts, except the liver, and add half 
a pound of fresh butter, a few shalots, a bunch of thyme, 
parsley, and a little savory, seasoned with salt, white 
pepper, mace, three or four cloves beaten, and a little 
chyan pepper. Stew them about half an hour over a 
good charcoal fire, and put in half a pint of Madeira 
wine, with as much of the broth as will cover it, and 
let it stew till tender, which will take about four or five 
hours. When it is nearly enough, skim it, tliicken it 
with flour, and some veal^ broth, and make ft about the 
thickness of a fricasee. Let your forcemeat balls be 
fried about the sisse of a walnut, and stewed about half 
an hour with the rest. If there are any eggs, let them 
be boiled and cleaned : but if none, get twelve or four- 
teen yolks of hard eggs. Then put the stew (which 
is the callipash) into the shell with the eggs, and either 
make use of a salamander, or put it into the oven to 
bake. Slash the callipee in several places, put some 
butter to it, and season it nioderately with chyan and 
white pepper, salt, beaten mace, chopped thyme, pars- 
ley, and young onions. Put a piece on each slash, and 
some over the whole, and a dust of flour : then bake 
it in a brisk oven, in a tin or iron dripping-pan. The 
back shell, which is called the callipasli, must be sea*

flcmed like the callipee, and baked in a diipping-pan, 
set upright, with four brick-bats, or any thing of that 
kind. An hour and a half will bake it, which mxist 
be done before the stew be put in. The fins,, when 
boiled very tender, must be taken out of the soup, and 
put into a stew-pan, with some good veal gravy, not 
high coloured, a Uttle Madeira wine, seasoned and 
thickened as the callipash, and served in a dish by 
itself. The lights, heait, and liver, may be done the 
same way, but a little higher seasoned ; or the lights 
and heart may be stewed with the callipash, and taken 
y^t before you put it into the shell, with a little of the 
satice, addmg a little more seasoning ; but dish it by 
itself. The veal part may be made fricandos, or Scotch 
coUops. The liver should never be stewed with the 
callipash, but dressed by itself in any manner you like ; 
except you separate the lights and heart from the cal- 
lipash, and serve them together in one dish. Be care- 
ful to strain the soup, and serve it in a tureen, or large 
china bowl. The diflferent dishes may be placed on 
the table as follows : The callipee at the head, the cal- 
lipash at the bottom, and the hghts, soup, fins, &c. in 
the centre. — The fins kept in the liquor will eat well 
when cold. 

Court Bouillon for all kinds of fresh Fish. 

Put into your fish kettle, which must be according 
to the size of your fish, some water, a quart of white 
wine, a bit oi butter, salt, pepper, a faggot of sweet 
herbs, some stewed onions and carrots : j^il your fish 
in this liquor.

THE first consideration of the cook in roasting roust 
be to regulate the strength of her fire in proportion to 
the article she has to dress. If it is a small or thin 
joint, the fire must be brisk, that it may be done quick ; 
but if a large one, a substantial fire must be made, in 
order that it may gradually receive the heat, and by 
stirring np the mre, when it begins to bum np, and 
keeping' the bottom clear, the meat must be roasted 
as it ought to be, and with little trouble to the cook. 
Never put salt on your meat before you lay it to the 
fire, as it will be apt to draw out the gravy. In roast- 
ing Beef^ if it be a large piece, skewer a sheet of writ- 
ing paper over the fat, and baste it well while roasting. 
When it is near enough, which you will know by the 
smoke drawing to the fire, take off the paper, then 
baste it well and dredge it with flour to make it frothy* 
Mutton and Lamb must be roasted with a clear quick 
fire. Veal requires particular care, and must be done 
of a fine light brown colour. If it is a fillet or loin, put 
paper over the fat, in the same manner as you do beef. 
At first let it be some distance from the fire, and baste 
it with butter : but when it is got thoroughly wanq 
put it nearer, and when neai'ly done, dredge it with 
flour. If a breast, put the caul over it, with the sweet- 
bread skewered on the back, and, when sufficiently 
done, take off the caul and dredge it with flour. Park 
as well as Veal should be well done, otherwise it will 
nauseate : but mutton and beef, if a little underdone, 
may be dispensed with. WUd Fowls must be roast- 
ed with a clear, brisk fire, and when they are fix>thy, 
and of a light brown colour, they are enough. Great 



care mast be takon not to ovardo them, as Hie loss of 
gravy will produce a want of the flavonr. TamB 
fowls require more roasting, and must be often basted, 
in order to keep up a strong froth, which will make 
them look well when brought to table. Pigs and 
Geese must be done with a quick fire, turned quick, 
and frequently basted. Hares and Rahbits require 
time and care, otherwise the body will be done too 
much, and the ends too Uttle. In roasting any article, 
always allow longer time for it in frosty than in mild 
weather, and take particular care that your spits are 
thoroughly clean before you put on your meat, as no- 
thing is more disagreeable than the mark of it left in 
the flesh. 

Having laid before the cook these necessary and gen* 
neral observations in roastmg, we shall now proceed to 
give directions for dressing the respective articles un« 
der this head; beginning with 

Beef. 

Thb first steps to be taken in roasting Beef we have 
already noticed in the foregoing observations. It re- 
mains, therefore, only to say, that the time each joint 
will take doing must be proportioned to its weight. If 
a piece of ten pounds, it will take an hour and a half at 
a good fire. Twenty pounds weight, if a thick piece, 
will take three hours, but if thin, half an hour less ; and 
so on in proportion to the weight. When done, take it 
up, and put it into your dish. Serve it with potatoes, 
horse-radish, and piddii for sauce, and garnish the rim 
of the dish with horse-radish scraped very fine. 

Mutton and Lamb. 

Mutton and Lamb must be roasted with a quick 
clear fire. Baste it as soon as you lay it down, sprinkle 
on a UtUe salt, and when near done, dredge it with 
flour. A leg of mutton of six pounds will t^e an houf 
and a quarter, and one of twelve two hours ; a breast 
half to hour at a quick fire : a neck an hour, and a shonl* 
der much about the same time as a leg. In dress- 



64 aoASTiNO 

ing the Idin, the chme (which is the two loins) and the 
saddle (^hich isthe two necks and part of the shoalders 
cut together) you must raise the skin, and skewer it on, 
and when near done, take off the skin, and baste it to 
fiK>th it up. Send some good plain gravy up with it. 

Haunch of Mutton dressed like Venison. 

Take a hind-quarter of fine mutton, stale killed, and 
cnt the leg like a haunch. Lay it in a pan with the back 
downwards, pour in a bottle of red wine, and let the 
meat soak in it twenty-four hours. Before you spit it, 
let it be covered with clean paper and paste as you do 
venison, in order to preserve the fat. Roast it before a 
quick fire, and keep basting with butter mixed with 
some of the liquor in which it was soaked. When done, 
serve it up with some good rich gravy in one boat, and 
sweet sauce in another. It will take about three hours 
roasting. 

Jt Fore-quarter of House Lamb. 

A small fore-quarter of house-lamb will take an hoiu: 
and a half roasting ; a leg three quarters of an hour. 
When it is done, and put into the dish, cut off the 
shoulder, and pepper and salt the ribs. Serve it up 
with salad,. broccoli, potatoes, or mint sauce. 

Tongues or Udders. 

Parboil the tongue before you put it down to 
roast ; stick eight or ten cloves about it, baste it with 
butter, and serve it up with some gravy and sweet- 
meat sauce. An udder may be roasted ailer the same 
manner. You may also lard the tongue nicely, but 
take care that the fire does not bum the larding. 

Veal. 

If your fire is good, veal will take about a quarter of 
an hour to each pound in roasting. The fat of the loin 
and fillet must be covered with paper, as we have be- 
fore observed. The^let and shoulder must be stuffed 
with the following savoury composition : a quarter of a 



MfiAT. 66 

pound of saet chopped fine, parsley and sweet herbs 
chopped, grated bread, and lemon peel ; pepper, salt, 
and a little natmeg, ^nd the yolk of an egg. Work 
these all well together, and staff them into your veal 
as secare as you can, that it may not fall oat while 
roasting. The breast must be roasted with the caul 
on till it is near enough ; then take it off, and flour and 
baste the meat. When you have taken it up, and put 
it into your dish, poor a little melted butter over it, and 
serve it up with any of the following sauces ; potatoes, 
brocoli, cucumbers stewed, French beans, peas, cauli- 
flowers, celery stewed. Remember in dressing any 
joint of veal that it is well done, but at the same time 
let it not be too much. If it is not done enough it will 
be too disgustful to enjoy, and if too much» the juices 
will be lost, and the flesh eat tasteless. 

Pork. 

Pork, like veal, must be well done. If it is a loin, 
take a sharp penknife, and cut the skin across, which 
will not only make the joint more convenient to carve, 
but will also make.tbe rind or crackling more pleasant 
to eat. A leg of pork must be scored in the same man- 
ner as the loin ; if not particularly objected to, stuff* 
the knuckle part with sage and onion chopped fine, 
with pepper and salt ; or cut a hole under the twist, 
iKit the seasoning there, and fasten it with a skewer. 
Koast it crisp, as it will make the crackling, of which 
most people are fond, eat the better. If you want a 
Spnngy (which is not very common, though, at the 
same time, if young, will eat exceeding well,) cut off' 
the shank, or knuckle, sprinkle sage and onion over it, 
roll it round, and tie it with a strinif. About two 
honvs will do it. The Spare-j^ib should be basted 
with a little bit of butter, a very little dust of flour, and 
some dried sage shred small. The principal sauces for 
any kind of roast pork are, potatoes, mustard, and 
•apple sauce, the latter of which you must make thus : 
Pare, core, and slice some apples, and put them into a 
saiice-pan with a little water, to prevent their bum- 



56 ROASTING 

kig, and throw in a bit of lemon-ped. When ibey 
are enough, take out the peel, bruise the apples, and 
add a piece of butter and a little sugar. When you 
have worked the whole together very fine, set it on the 
fire till it is quite hot, then put it into your basin, and 
serve it up with the meat. If it is a leg of pork, have 
a little drawn gravy ready against it is done, and pour 
it into the dish when you serve it up. The best way 
of dressing Pork Oriskin is to roast it, baste it with 
a little butter and sage, and a little pepper and salt. 
The only article used as sauce for this is mustard. 

Sucking Pigs 

When your pig is properly prepared for dressing, 
put into the belly of it a little sage shredded fine, with 
some salt, a tea-spoonful of black pepper, and a crust 
/ of brown bread. Then spit it, sew up the belly, and 
lay it down to a brisk clear fire, with a pig-plate hung 
in the middle to prevent the body part being done be- 
fi>re the extremities. As soon as it is warm, put a 
piece of butter into a cloth, and firequently rub the pig 
with it while roasting. When it becomes of a fine 
brown, and the steam drawB to the fire, rub it quite 
dry with a clean cloth, and then with a bit of cold but- 
ter, wliich will help to crisp it. Having taken it up, 
and put it into your dish, cut off the head with a sharp 
knife, and take off the collar, the ears, and the jaw- 
bone. Split the jaw in two, and when you have cut 
the pig down the back, which must be done before you 
draw out the spit, lay the two sides with the back part 
to each other, a jaw on each side, and an ear on. each 
shoulder, and the collar on the shoulder. Have rea- 
dy your sauce, wliich you must make in the following 
manner : Having chopped the brains, put them in a 
saucepan, with a tea-spoonful of white gravy, the gravy 
that runs out of the pig, (which you must be careful to 
save, by putting a basin or pan in the dripping-pan 
under the pig as soon as the gra^T^ begins to run,) and 
a small piece of anchovy. Add to these half a pound 
of butter, and as much flour as vnll thicken the gravy^ 



MEAT. 57 

a dice of lemon, a q)oonful of white wine, siome caper 
liquor, and a litde salt. Shake it over the fire till it 
18 quite hot, then pour it into your dish with the pig, 
and serve it up. You may likewise hoil a few currants, 
and send them in a tea-saucer, with a glass of currant 
jeUy in the middle. 

As there may sometimes be a necessity for the cook's 
killing the pig herself, it may not be improper to inform 
her in that case how to proceed. Stick the pig just 
above the breast-boiie, and let the knife touch its heart, 
otherwise it will be a long time dying. As soon as it 
is dead, put it into cold water for a tew minutes, and 
rub it over with a little rosin beat exceeding fine, or 
instead of that use its own blood, which will nearly 
answer the same purpose. Let it Ue half a minute in 
a pail of scalding water, then take it out, lay it upon a 
clean table, and strip off all the hairs as fast as possible ; 
but if they do not come clean off, put it into the hot 
water again, and when it is perfectly clean off, wash it 
in warm water, and then in two or three cold waters, 
that, when dressed, it may not taste of the rosin. Take 
off the four feet at the first joints, slit it down the belly, 
and take out all the entrails. Put the heart, Uver, 
lights, and pettitoes together ; wash the pig well in cold 
water, and having perfectly dried it with a cloth, hang 
it up. When you dress it, proceed as before directed. 

Calf's Head. 

When you have thoroughly washed, and cleansed 
it firom the slime, take out the bones, and dry it well 
in a cloth. Make a seasoning of beaten mace, pepper, 
salt, nutmeg, and cloves, some bacon cut very small, 
and some grated bread. Strew this over the head, roll 
it up, skewer it, and tie it with tape. While roast- 
ing, baste it with butter, and when done, having pre- 
viously made a rich veal gravy, thickened with butter 
roUed in flour, pour it over, and serve it to table. Some 
like mushroom sauce, in which case make it as fol- 
lows : Clean and wash a quart of firesh mushrooms, 
cut them into pieces, and put them into a stew-pan.

with a little salt, a blade of mace, and a little butter. 
Stew them gently fer half an honr, and then add a 
pint of cream, and the yolks of two eggs beaten up fine : 
keep stirring it till it boils, then pour it into a boat, 
and serve it up with the head. This is an excellent 
sauce for fowls or turkeys. 

Ham, or Gammon of Bacon. 

Whichever you dress of these, take off the skin 
or rind, and lay the meat in luke-warm water for two 
or three hours. Then put it into a pan, pour over it 
a quart of Canary wine, and let it soak about half an 
hour. When you have spitted it, put a sheet of clean 
paper over the fat side, pour the Canary, in which it 
was soaked, into the dripping-pan, and baste the meat 
with it all the time it is roasting. When it is enough, 
take off the paper, and dredge it well with crumbled 
bread and parsley shred fine. Make the fire brisk, and 
brown it well. If you serve it up hot, garnish with 
raspings of bread ; but if cold for a second course, gar- 
nish with green parsley.

Turkeys. 

Whe n your Turkey is jHDperly trussed for dress- 
ing, stuff it with the following ingredients : Take four 
ounces of butter, or chopped suet, some grated bread, 
a little lemon peel, parsley, and sweet herbs chopped 
together, pepper, salt, and natmeg, a little cream, and 
the yolks of two or three eggs ; work these all well to- 
gether, and fill the craw with it. Let your fire be very 
brisk, and when you put it down paper the breast, and 
let it continue on till near done ; then take it off, dredge 
it with flour, and keep basting it till it is done. If it is 
a large turkey, serve it up with gravy alone, or brown 
celery, or mushroom sauce. If it is a turkey-poult. 



POULTRY. 59 

•erve it up with gravy and bread sauce, the latter of 
which make thus : Gut the crumby part of a penny 
loaf into thin slices, put it into a saucepan with cold 
water, a few pepper corns, a little salt, and an onion : 
boil it till the bread is quite soft, and then beat it very 
fine : put it into a quarter of a pound of butter, with 
two spoonsful of thick cream, and when it boUs up, 
pour it into a basin, or boat, and serve it up with the 
turkey. A middling sized turkey will take more than 
an hour, a small one three quarters of an hour, and a 
very large one an hour and a half In dressing these, 
as well as fowls, always let your fire be clear and 
brisk. 

Fowls. 

When your fowls are laid to the fire, singe them, 
then baste them with butter, and dredge over some 
flour. When the smoke begins to draw to the^ fire, 
baste and dredge them again : let the fire be brisk, 
and send them to table with a good firoth. The pro- 
per sauces for roast fi>wls are, gravy, egg, mushroom, 
or celery-sauce, the latter of wliich make thus : Wash 
and pare a large bunch of celery very clean, cut it into 
thin bits, and boil it gently in a little water till it is 
tender : then add a little beaten mace, nutmeg, pep- 
per, and salt, and thicken it with a large piece of but- 
ter rolled in flour : then give it a boil, ^nd serve it up in 
a boat. To the water in which you boil the celery 
put a half pint of cream,^ which wUl make it very rich 
and substantial. This is an excellent sauce, not only 
for fowls but also for partridges, or any other game of 
the same kind. 

Chickens. 

Be particularly careful in drawing your chickens, 
which done, cut ofi* their claws, and truss them for 
dressing. Put them down to a good fire, and 'singe, 
dust, and baste them with butter. When they are 
enough, firoth them, and lay them in your dish. Serve 
them up with parsley and butter poured over them, and 



60 ROASTiifa 

gravy and mushroom sauce in boats. A large chicken 
will take half an hour, a small one twenty minutes. 

Green Geese. 

When the goose is properly cleaned, and ready for 
dressing, put into the body a large lump of butter, then 
spit it, and lay it down to^a brisk clear fire. Singe it, 
ciredge it with flour, and as soon as it begins to receive 
the heat of the fire, baste it well with butter, which 
will occasion the flesh to rise, and make it look well. 
When you think it near enough, dredge it again with 
flour ; and baste it till the firoth rises, and it is of a clear 
light brown. When done, take it up, and put it into 
your dish, having ready the following sauce : Melt 
some butter, and put it into a spoonful of sorrel juice, a 
little sugar, and a few scalded gooseberries. Pour it 
into your sauce-boat, and send it up hot with the goose 
to table. You may likewise add gravy and apple- 
sauce, and garnish your dish with a crust of bread gra- 
ted very fine. 

A Stubble Goose 

Takb two onions, with a few leaves of sage wash- 
ed clean, and chop them as fine as possible. Mix with 
them a large piece of butter, some salt, and pepper. 
Put this into the body of the goose, then tie botii ends, 
and put it down to the fire to roast. Singe and dredge it 
with flour, and when it is thoroughly hot, baste it with 
fi-esh butter. When near done dredge it again, 
and keep basting it till the firoth rises, and the steam 
draws to the fire, then take it up, and put it into your 
dish, pour a little boiling hot water over it, and serve 
it up with good gravy-sauce in one boat, apple-sauce 
in another, and mustard. 

Ducks. 

You must prepare them for th^ spit in the same 
manner you do geese, by putting into the body some 
sage and onion chopped fine, with pepper and salt. 
When you lay them down, singe, dust, and baste them 



POULTRY. 61 

with butter, and a good fire will roast them in about 
twenty minutes. Before you take them up, dust them 
with flour, and give them another basting with butter 
to make them firoth and look brown. Your gravy 
must be made of the gizzard and pinions, with an onion, 
a tea-spoonfol of lemon-piclde, a few grains of pepper, 
a large blade of mace, and a tea-spoonful of catsup. 
When they are thoroughly stewed, strain off the gravy, 
put some into the dish with the ducks, and the remain- 
der in a boat or basin. Wild ducks must be done in 
the same manner. 

Pigeons. 

After you have drawn your Pigeons, and taken the 
craws clean out, wash them in several waters. When 
you have dried them, roll a good lump of butter in some 
chopped parsley, and season it with pepper and salt. 
Put this into your pigeons, then spit, dust with flour, 
and baste them. When enough, serve them up with 
parsley and butter for sauce, and, if in season, garnish 
your dish with bmiches of asparagus. A good &re will 
roast them in twenty minutes. * 

Larks. 

Take a dozen of Larks, put them on a skewer, and 
tie both ends of the skewer to the spit. Dredge and 
baste them, and in about ten or twelve minutes they 
will be done. Make your sauce thus : take the crumb 
of half a penny loaf, shred it very fine, and put it into 
a stew-pan or fi7ing pan, with a piece of butter about 
the size of a walnut. Shake it over a gentle fire till 
it is of a light brown, then lay it between your birds on 
your plate or dish, aad pour a little melted butter over 
them. 

Rabbits. 

When you have cased your rabbits, skewer their 
heads upon their backs, their fore legs into their ribs, 
and the hind legs double. Take the crumb of half a 
penny loaf, a little parsley, thyme, sweet-marjorum, and 
lemon-peel. Shred all these fine, and season them with 
pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Mix them up into a light 



€2 BOASTIMO 

stoffing tdtli two eggs, a little cream, and a quarter cf 
a pound of butter. Put this into their bellies> sew 
them up, and dredge and baste them well with butter. 
When done, take them up, chop the hvers after boil- 
ing, and lay them in lumps round the edge of your dish. 
Serve them up with parsley and butter for sauce. 

To roast a rabbit hare fashion, you must lard it with 
bacon, and baste it in the same manner you do a hare, 
du'ections for which you will find in the next section. 
If you lard it, make gravy sauce ; if not, white sauce 
will be most proper. 



SECT. III. 

ROASTING GAME. 

Pheasants and Partridges. 

The same methods ai*e to be taken in dressing ei- 
ther of these birds. When you have spitted and laid 
. them down, dust them with jBour, and baste them often 
with fresh butter, keeping them at a good distance 
from the fire. About half an hour will roast them. 
Make your gravy of a scrag of mutton, and put into 
the sauce-pan with it a tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle, 
a large spoonful of catsup, and the same of brown- 
ing.* Strain it, and put a little into the dish with the 
bii'ds. Serve them up with the remainder in one ba- 

*Aa we shall have frequent occasion to mention the article brown- 
ing, it will be necessary here to give proper directions how to make 
iti — Beat small four ounces of treble refined sugar, and put it into a 
frying pan with one ounce of butter. — Set it over a clear fire, and mix 
it well together. When it begins to be frothy by the sugar dissolving, 
hold it higher over the fire, and have ready a pint of red wine. When 
the sugar and butter is of a deep brown, pour in a little of the wine, 
and stir it well together ; then add more wine, and keep stirring it all 
the time. Put in half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, six cloves, four 
shalots peeled, two or three blades of mace, three spoonsful of 
catsup, a little salt, and a rind of one lemon. BoO them slowly about 
ten minutes, and then pour it into a basin. Wnen cold, take off tho 
scorn very clean, and bottle it up for use. 



OAMB. 63 

sin, and bread sauce in another. By way of ornament 
fix one of the principal feathers of the pheasant in its 
tail. 

Woodcocks or Snipes. 

These birds are so pecnliar fi^om all others, that 
they must never be drawn. When you have spitted 
them, take the round of a threepenny loaf, and toast 
it nice and brown ; then lay it in a dish, under the 
birds, and when you put them to the fire, baste them 
with a httle butter, and let the traU or gut drop on the 
toast. When they are done, put the toast in a dish, 
and lay the birds on it. Pour about a quarter of a pint 
of gravy into the dish, and set it over a lamp or chafing^ 
dish for three or four minutes, and then take it hot to 
table. A woodcock will take about twenty minutes 
roasting, and a snipe fifteen. 

Hares. 

When your hare is cased and properly trussed for 
dressing, make a stuffing thus : Take a large slice of 
bread, and crumble it very fine, put to it a quarter of 
a pound of beef marrow, or suet, the like quantity of 
butter, the liver boiled and shred fine, a sprig or two of 
winter savory, a bit of lemon-peel, an anchovy, a little 
cliyan pepper, and half a nutmeg grated. Mix these 
well together with a glass of red wine and two eggs, 
put it into the belly of the hare and sew it up. When 
you have spitted it, and laid it before the fire, put into 
your dripping-pan a quart of milk, and keep basting 
your hare with it till there is little left. When it is 
nearly done, dredge it with flour, and baste it with but- 
ter till it is properly frothed. If it is a small hare it 
will take about an hour and a half; and if a large one 
two hours. When done, put it into your dish, and 
serve it up with plenty of good rich gravy, and some 
currant-jelly warmed in a cup ; or red wine and sugar 
done to a syrup thus : Take a pint of red wine, put it 
into a quarter of a pound of sugar, set it over a slow 
fire, and let it simmer for a quarter of an hour ; then 
take it off, and poiu: it into your sauce-boat or basin. 



64 ROASTING FISH. 

Ven%8an. 

Take a hannch of venison, and when yon have 
spitted it, rub some bntter all over it. Take four 
dieets of clean paper, well buttered, two of which put 
on the haunch. Then make a paste with some flour, 
a Uttle butter and water : roll it out half as big as your 
hamich, and put it over the fat part ; cover this ^th 
the other two sheets of paper, and tie them fast with 
packthread. Lay it to a brisk fire, and baste it well 
all the time it is roasting. When it is near done, take 
off both paper and paste, dredge it well with flour, 
and baste it with butter. As soon as it becomes of a 
light brown, l^e it up, and serve it to table with 
brown gravy, cmTant-jelly, or the syrup menti(Hied 
in the preceding article for a hare. A haunch will 
take about three hours roasting.

ROASTING FISH. 

To roast Sturgeon. 

Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stew-pan, 
with salt, pepper, parsley, onions, sweet herbs, cloves, 
half a pint of water, and a little vinegar. Stir it over the 
fire, and when it is luke-warm take it off, and put your 
sturgeon in to steep. When it has taken the flavour 
of the herbs, roast it, and serve it up with any vege- 
table sauce you think fit. 

Roasted en Chras. 

Lard it with fat bacon, roast it, and serve it with 
a ragout of truffles, morels, mushrooms, veal, sweet-^. 
bread, &c. 

Lobsters. ^ 

■ 

When you have half boiled your lobster take it 
out of the water, nib it well with butter, and lay it 
before the fire ; continue basting it with butter' tall it 
has a fine firoth, and the shells look of a dark brown. 
Then put it into your dish, and s^rve it up with plain 
melted butter in a sauce-boat.

BUTCHER'S MEAT. 

THE only method to be observed previous to this 
mode of cookery, is to have the pans, or whatever 
vessels yon send your provisions in to the oven, per- 
fectly clean, so that the care you have taken in pre- 
paring the article may not be injured fix)m neglect in 
cleanHness. 

Rump of Beef a-la-Braise. 

Gut out the bone quite clean, then beat the fl^h 
well with a rolling-pin, and lard it with a piece of 
bacon cut out of the back. Reason your bacon with ' 
pepper, salt, and cloves, and lard across the meat, 
that it may cut handsomer. Season the meat with 
pepper, salt, and cloves ; put it into an earthen pot 
with all the broken bones, half a pound of butter, 
some bay leaves, whole pepper, one or two shalots, 
and some sweet herbs. Let the top of the pan be 
covered quite close, then put it into the oven, and it 
vnll be done in about six hours. When enough, skim 
off the fat dean, put the meat into a dish, and serve 
it up with a good ragout of mushrooms, truffles, forcer 
meat-balls, and yell^ of eggs. Let the gravy which 
comes from the beef be added, nicely seasoned, to 
those ingredients. 

Cdlf^s Head. 

When you have properly cleansed the head, put 
it into a large earthen dish, or pan, and rub the inude 
witli butter. Put some long iron skewers across the 
top of the dish, and lay the head on them. Grate 
some nutmeg all over the head, with a few sweet 
herbs dured eunall, some crumbs of bread, and ^ little 
lemon-peel cut fine. Then flour it all over^ stick i

pieces of batter in the eyes, and on different parts of 
the head, and send it to the oven. You may throw 
a httle pepper and salt over it, and put into the dish 
a bunch of sweet lierbs, an onion, a blade of mace, 
some whole pepper, two cloves, and a pint of -water, 
and boil the brains with some sage. When the head 
is enough, lay it on a dish, and put it before the fire 
to keep warm ; then stir all together in the dish, and 
put it into a saucepan, and when it is quite hot strain 
it off, and pour it into the saucepan again. Put in a 
piece of butter rolled in flour, the sage and brains 
chopped fine, a spoonful of catsup, and two of red 
wine. Boil them well together, pour the whole over 
the head in a dish, and send it to table. 

Pigs. 

Lay your pig into a dish well ibutteredt flour it all 
over» rub some butter on the pig, and send it to the 
oven. When you think it is eiioogh, take it out, rub 
it over with a buttered cloth, and put it into the oven 
again tUl it is dry ;. then take it out, lay it in a dish, 
and cut it up. Skim off the fat from the dish it was 
baked in, and some good gravy will remain at the 
bottom. Put this to a Httle veal gravy, with a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, and boil it up with the brains ; 
then pour it into a dish, and mix it well with the 
sage that comes out of the belly of the pig. Serve it 
up hot to table with apple-sauce and mustard. 

•i BullocJis or Calf-s Heart. 

Take some crumbs of bread, chopped suet, (or a 
bit of butter,) parsley chopped, sweet marjoram, le- 
mon-peel grated, pepper, salt, and nutmeg, a\ ith the 
yolk of an egg ; mix these aU well together, stufl' tlie 
heart with it, and send it to the oven. When done, 
serve it up with gravy, melted butter, and currant- 
jelly in boats. The same methods are to be used 
whether you bake or roast it ; but if care is taken, 
baking it is the best way, as it will be more regularly 
done than it can be by roasting.

BAKING FISH. 

Cod's Head. 

When it is thoronghly cleansed and washed, lay 
it in the dish, which you most first rub round with 
butter. Put in a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion stuck 
with cloves, three or four blades of mace, some black 
and white pepper, a nutmeg bruised, a little lemon* 
peel, a piece of horse-radish, and a quart of water. 
Dust the head with flour, grate a little nutmeg over 
it, stick bits of butter on various parts, and sprinkle 
raspings all over it, and send it to the oven. When 
done, take the head out of the dish, and put it into 
that it is to be served up in. Set the dish over boil- 
ing water, and cover it close to prevent its getting 
cold. In the mean time, as expeditiously as you can, 
pour all the liquor out of the dish in which it was 
baked into a saucepan, and let it boil three or four 
minutes : then strain it, and put to it a gill of red 
wine, two spoonsful of catsup, a pint of shrimps, half 
a pint of oysters, a spoonful of mushroom pickle, and 
a quartern of butter rolled in flour. Stir all well to- 
gether, and let it boil till it is thick ; then strain it, 
and pour it into the dish. Have ready some toasted 
bread cut three corner ways, and fried crisp. Stick 
some pieces of toast about the head and mouth, and 
lay the remainder round the head. Garnish your dish 
with crisped parsley, lemon notched, and scraped 
horse-radish. This method is equally good for 
roasting;. 

* Salman 

Take a piece of salmon, of five or six pounds 
weight, (or larger according to your company,) and 
cut it into slices about an inch thick, after which 
make a forcemeat thus : Take some of the flesh of the 
salmon, and the same quantity of the meat of an eel.

with a few mushiooms. Seaaon it with pepper, salt, 
nutmeg, and cloves, and beat dl together till it is very 
fine. Boil the cnimb of a roll in milk, and beat it up 
with four eggs till it is thick ; th^ let it cool, add 
four more raw eggs to it, and mix' the whole well to- 
gether. Take the «kin from the salmon, and lay the 
slices in a dish. Cover every slice with the forcemeat, 
pour some melted butter over them, with a few crumbs 
of bread, and place oysters round the dish. Put it into 
the oven, and when it is of a fine brown, pour over a 
little melted butter with some red wine boiled in it, 
and the juice of a lemon, and serve it up hot to table 

Carp. 

Take a brace of carp, and having greased the pan, 
in which they are to be baked, with butter, put them 
into it. Let it be of such a sisse as will hold them at 
full length, otherwise they will be apt to break. When 
you have put them into the pan, season them with a 
little black and white pe{^r, mace, cloves, nutmeg, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and an anchovy : 
then pour in a bottle of white wine, cover them dose, 
and put them into the oven. If of a large size they 
will take an hour baking ; but if small, a less time will 
do. When enough, take them out of the pan, and 
lay them in a dish. Set it over boiling water to keep 
it hot, and cover it close. Pour all the liquor in which 
they were baked into a saucepan ; let it boil a minute 
or two, strain it, and add half a pound of butter roll- 
ed in flour. Keep stirring it all the time it is boiling ; 
squeeze in the juice of hali a lemon, and put in a pro- 
per quantity of salt, observing to skim iJl the fat off 
the liquor. Pour the sauce over the fish, lay the roes 
round them, and garnish with lemon. 

Eels and Lampreye. 

Cut off their heads, gut th^n, and tidce out the 
blood firom the bone as clean as possible. Make a 
forcemeat of shrimps or oysters chopped small, half a 
penny loaf crumbled, a little lemon-peel shred fine, the

yolks of two eggs, and a Utile salt, pepper, and nut- 
meg. Put this into the bellies of the &h, sew them 
np, and torn them round on the dish. Pat flonr and 
batter over them, poar a little water into the dish, 
and bake them in a moderate oven. When done, 
take the gravy from nnder them, and skim off the fat, 
strain it tibroagh a hair sieve, and add one tea-spoon- 
fol of lemon-pickle, two of browning, a large spoonful 
of walnat catsnp, a glass of white wine, an anchovy, 
and a slice of lemon. Let it boil ten minates, and 
tliicken it witii batter and floor. Garnish with lemon 
and crisped parsley. 

Herrings. 

SoALi, wash, and dry thein well in a doth, then 
lay them on a board, and take a little Uack pepper, a 
few cloves, and plenty of salt ; mix them together, and 
rub the fish all over with it Lay them straight in a 
pot, cover them over with vinegar, pot in a few bay- 
leaves, tie a strong paper over tte top, and bake them 
in a moderate oven. They may be eat either hot or 
cold ; and if yoa ose the best vinegar, they will keep 
good fer two or tiiree months. 

Sprats ma V be done in the same manner, and either 
of them will rarnish an occasional and pleasing relish* 

Turbot 

Take a dish about the size of the turbot, rub but- 
ter thick all over it, throw on a little salt, a little bea- 
ten pepper, half a large nutmeg, and some parsley 
chopped fine. Pour in a pint of white wine, cut off 
the head and tail, and lay the turbot in the dish; pour 
another pint of white wine all over, grate the other 
half of the nutmeg over it, a little pqpper, some salt, 
and chopped parsley. Lay a piece of^ butter here and 
there all over, then strew it with flour and crumbs of 
bread. Being thus prepared, send it to the oven, and 
let it be done of a fine brown colour. When you take 
it out, or have it home, put the turbot into the dish in 
which you mean to serve it up, then stir the sauce in

the dish it was baked in, pour it into a saucepan, 
shake in a little flour, let it boil, and then stir in a 
piece of butter with two spoonsful of catsup. When 
the whole boils, pour it into basins, and serve it up 
with the fish. Garnish your dish with lemons ; and you 
may add what otiier sauce you &ncy, as shrimps, an- 
chovies, mushrooms, &c. 

PikCy with forcemeat. 

Prepare your pike thus : — Gut it, without cut- 
ting it open, and take care it is well cleaned. Cut a 
notch down the back firom head to tail, turn it round, 
and fasten the tail in the mouth. Make your force- 
meat thus : Take the udder of a 1^ of veal, or the 
kidney part of a loin of lamb, some fat bacon cut in 
dice, the spawn or melt of the fish, some green onions, 
a mushroom or two, or truffles, parsley and salt, and a 
little nutm^ and pepper : add a bit of butter to firy 
it ; chop it all well, with the crumb of a French roll 
soaked in cream or milk. Pound all together in a 
large mortar, with three or four eggs ; try if it is sea- 
soned to your mind, fill the beUy of yoiu: fish with it, 
close up that part which was cut in the back, and make 
it nice and even. Then take two or three eggs, beat 
them up, daub the fish well over with it, and strew on 
some crumbs of bread. Put it in a gentle oven, and 
proportion the time according to the size of your fish. 
When done use the following sauce : take two or three 
ladles of good gravy, and add to it three large spoons- 
ful of whole capers, some parsley chopped fine, the 
juice of two lemons, and a little minced shalot. Pour 
this into a boat or basin, and serve it up hot with 
your fish. Garnish with firied parsley. A piper may 
be baked the same as the pike. 

Mackarel. 

Gut their heads otf, wash and dry them in a cloth, 
cut them open, rub the bone with a little bay-salt, 
beat fine : take some mace, black and white pepper, 
and a few cloves, all beat fine ; lay them in a long 



BBOILINA MBAT, 4*<^. 71 

pm, and betwe^ every layer offish put two or fiiree 
bay leaves, and cover them'withvine^. Tie siting 
paper over thetn first, and then thick brown paper 
doubled. They must be pnt into a very slow oren, 
and will take a long time doing. When they are 
enough, uncover them, and let them st^nd till they 
arc cold, then pour away all the vinegar they are 
boiled in, cm^er them with some more vinegar, and put 
in an onion stuck with cloves. Send them to a very 
slow oven again, and let them stand two houns. When 
completely done, put them aside, and they will keep 
good a considerable time. When you take them out, 
let it be with a slice^ as your hands will be apt. to 
break and spoil them. They make a most excellent 
occasional repast. 



CHAPTER V 

BROILIJfG. 

IN this mode of cooking, three things are to be prin- 
cipally observed. First, that your gridiron is tho- 
roughly clean, and your fire quite clear. Secondly, 
that you turn your meat quick and often vvhile broiling, 
as it will be a means of preserving the juices. And, 
thirdly, to have your dish placed on a chafing-dish of 
hot coals, that by putting one piece after another into 
it as they are done, the whole may be taken quite hot 
to table.

Betf Steaks. 

Let your steaks be cut off the rump of beef about 
half an inch thick ; take care to have your fire clear, 
and rob your gridiron well with beef suet. When it 
is hot lay on your steaks : let them broil till the side 



72 BROILII«« 

next the fire tt brawn ; then turn theni» «ad when the 
othar side is brown, lay them on a hot dish, with a 
eliee of batter between each steak : sprinkle a littte 
pepper and salt over them, and let them stand two or 
three minutes ; in the mean time slice a shalot as thin 
as possible into a spoonful of water ; lay on your steaks 
again, and keep turning them till they are enough ; then 
put them (m your dish, pour the shalot and water over 
them, and send them to table. Add for sauce horse- 
radish and pickles. Gamishwith scraped horse-radish. 

Mutton Steaks. 

Cut your steaks about half an inch thick, and if it 
be the loin, take off the skin yfith a part of the fat 
When your gridiron is. hot, rub it with fiesh suet, lay 
on your steaks, and keep turning them as quic^ as 
possible : if you do not take great care, the fat that 
drops from them into the fire will smoke and spoil 
them: but this may be in a great measure prevented, 
by placing your gridiron on a slant. When enough 
put them into a hot dish, rub them well with butter, 
slice a shalot very thin into a spoonful of water, and 
pour it on them, with a spoonful of catsup. . Serve 
them up hot, with scraped horse-radish and pickles. 

Pork Chops. 

In broiling these the same roles are to be observed 
as those given for mutton chops, except with this dif- 
fisrence, that they require more doing. When they 
are enough, put a little good gravy to them ; and in 
order to give them an agreeable flavour, strew over 
a little sage shred very fine. The only sauce is 
mustard. 

Ox Palates. 

Prepare your palates for broiling thus : having 
peded them, put into a stew-pan a little butt^ rolled 
in flour, salt, and pepper, two shalots, a dove of gaiiic, 
two cloves, parsley, a laurel leaf, thyme, and as much 
milk as will simmer your palates till teydar. When 



MBAT» 4*^. 73 

this is done, take them ont, and rub over them the 
yolks of eggs with bread crumbs ; then put them on 
your gridiron, broil them slowly, and when enough 
serve them up with sharp sauce. 

Chickens. 

Split your chickens down the back, season them 
with pepper and salt, and lay them on the gi'idu'on 
over a clear fire, and at a great distance. Let the 
insides continue next the fire till they are nearly half 
done; then turn them, taking care that the fleshy 
sides do not bum, and let them broil till they are of a 
fine brown. Have ready good gravy sauce, with 
some mushrooms, and garnish them with lemon and 
the livers broiled ; the gizzards cut, slashed, and broil- 
ed, with pepper and sait. Or you may make the fol- 
lowing sauce : take a handful of sorrel, and dip it in 
boiling water ; then drain it, and have ready half a 
pint of good gravy ; a shalot shred small, and some 
parsley boiled very green ; thicken it with a piece of 
butter rolled in flour, and add a glass of red wine ; 
then lay your sorrel in heaps round the chickens, and 
pour the sauce over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

Pigeons. 

Pigeons may be broiled either whole or sUt, and 
must be done very slowly over a clear fire. If you 
broil them whole, take some parsley shred fine, a 
piece of butter as big as a walnut, with a little pepper 
and salt, and put into their bellies, tying both ends 
with a bit of coarse thread. If you split them, season 
the inside with pepper and salt; and when done, 
serve them up with parsley and butter poured over 
them. They will be quicker done by being slit : bat 
the best metiiiod is to broil them whole.

BROILING FISH. 

Fresh Salman. 

Cut some slices from a fresh salmon, and wipe them 
clean and dry ; then melt some butter smooth and fine, 
with a little flour and basket salt. Put the pieces of 
sahnon into it, and roll them about, that they may be 
covered all over with butter. Then lay them on a nice 
clean gridiron, and broil them over a clear but slow 
fire. While the salmon is broiUng make yom* sauce 
thus : take two anchovies, wash, bone, and cut them 
into small pieces, and cut a leek into three or four long 
pieces. Set on a saucepan with some butter and a little 
flour, put in the anchovies and leek, with some capers 
cut small, some pepper and salt, and a little nutmeg ; 
add to them some warm water, and two spoonsfi:tl of 
vinegar, shaking the saucepan till it boils ; and then 
keep it on the simmer till you are ready for it. When 
the salmon is done on one side, turn it on the other till 
it is quite enough ; then take the leek out of the sauce, 
pour it into a dish, and lay the broiled salmon upon it. 
Garnish with lemons cut in quarters. 

Dried Salman. 

Lay your dried salmon in soak for two or three 
hours, then lay it on the gridiron, and shake over it a 
little pepper. It will take but a short time, and when 
done serve it up with melted butter. 

Cad. 

Cut the cod into slices about two inches thick, and 
dry and flour them well. Make a good dear fire, rub 
the gridiron with a piece of chalk, and set it high from 
the fire. Then put in yom* sUces of fish, turn, them 
often, and let them brown till they are of a fine brown 
colour. Great care must be taken in turning them that 
they do not break. When done serve them up with 
lob$ter and shrimp sauce. 



FISH. '' 75 

Crimped Cod. 
Take a gallon of spring water^ pnt it into a sauce- 
pan over the fire, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil 
t up several times, and keep it clean scummed. When 
t is well cleared from the scum, take a middling sized 
tod, as firesh as possible, and put it into some firesb 
oump water. Let it lie a few minutes, and then cut 
A into slices about two inches thick. Throw these into 
the boiling brine, and let them boil briskly a few mi- 
nutes. Then take the slices out with gi-eat care that 
they may not break, and put them on a sieve to drain. 
When tiiey are well dried, flour them, and lay them 
at a distance upon a very good fire to Inroil. When 
enough serve them up with lobster, slirimp, or oyster 
sauce. 

Cod Sounds. 

Lav them a few minutes in hot water; then take 
them out, rub them well with salt, and take off the 
skin and black dirt, that they may look white. After 
this put them into water, and give them a boil, then 
take them out, flour them well, strew on some pepper 
and salt, and lay them on the gridiron. When enough 
lay them on your dish, and pour over them melted 
butter and mustard. 

Trout. 

When you have properly cleansed your fish, and 
made it thoroughly dry with a cloth, tie it round with 
packthread from head to tail, in order to preserve its 
shape entire. Then melt some butter, with a good 
deal of basket salt, and pour it all over the trout till it 
is perfectly covered : after lying in it a minute or two, 
take it out, and put it on the gridiron over a clear fire, 
that it may do gradually. For sauce wash and bone 
an anchovy, and cut it very small ; chop a large spoon- 
ful of capers ; melt some butter, with a little flour, pep- 
per, salt and nutmeg, and put it into the anchovy and 
capers, with half a spoonful of vinegar. When the 
trout is done lay it in a warm dish, pour your sauce 
boiling hot over it, and send it to table.

Mackarel. 

Wash them dean, cut ojBf their heads, and take 
out the roes at the neck end. Boil the roes in a little 
water ; then bruise them with a spoon, beat up the 
yolk of an egg, with a little nutmeg ; a little lemon- 
peel cut fine, some thyme, parsley boiled and chopped 
fine, a little salt and pepper, and a few cruml^ of 
bread. Mix these well together, and put it into the 
beUies of the fish ; then flour them well, and broil them 
nicely. Let your sauce be melted butter, with a little 
catsup or walnut pickle. 

Mackarel a-da-Maitre d? Hotel. 

Bboil your Mackarel whole : the sauce is sweet 
herbs, chopped fine, in melted butter. 

Haddocks and Whitings. 

When you have gutted and clean washed them, 
dry them well in a cloth, and rub a little vinegar over 
them, which will prevent the skin fi'om breaking. 
Having done this, dredge them well with flour, and 
before you put them on, rub the gridiron well with 
beef suet. Let your gridiron be very hot when you 
lay your fish on, otherwise they will stick to it, and 
the fish be broke in turning. While they are broiling, 
turn them two or three times, and when enough serve 
them up with plain melted butter, or shrimp sauce. 

Another, and indeed a very excellent method ol 
broiling these fish is thus : when ydu have cleaned and 
dtied tiiem as before-mentioned, put them into a tin 
oven, and set them before a quick fire. As soon as 
the skins begin to rise, take them firom the . fire, and 
having beat up an ^g, rub it over them with a fea- 
ther. Sprinkle a few crumbs of bread over them, 
dredge them well with flour, and rub your gridiron, 
when hot, with suet or butter. Lay on your fish, 
and when you have turned them, rub over a little 
butter, and keep turning them till they are done, 
which will be known by their appearing of a nice

Eels. 

Having skinned, cleansed, and dried your eels, 
rub them with the yolk of an egg ; strew over them 
aome crumbs of bread, chopped parsley and sage, and 
season them with pepper and salt. Baste them well 
with butter, and then put them on the gridiron over a 
clear fire. When done, serve them up with melted 
butter and parsley. 

Eels pitch-cocked. 

Take a large eel, and scour it well with salt, to 
clean o£f the slime ; then slit it down the back, take 
out the bone, and cut it into three or four pieces. Take 
the yolk of an egg, and put it over the inside, sprinkle 
on crumbs of bread with some sweet herbs and pars- 
ley chopped very fine, a little nutmeg grated, and some 
pepper and salt muced together. Then put it on a 
gridiron over a clear fire, broil it of a fine light browp, 
and when enough, serve it up with anchovy sauce, 
and parsley and butter. Garnish with raw parsley 
and horse-radish. 

Another method of pitch-cocking eels is, when you 
have gutted, cleansed, and properly dried them, sprin- 
kle them with pepper, salt, and a little dried sage, turn 
them backward and forward, and skewer them. Rub 
your gridiron with beef suet, broil them a good brown, 
and when done, put them into your dish, and serve 
them up with plain melted butter for sauce. Garnish 
your dish vrith fi-ied parsley. 

Herrings. 

Scale, gut, and cut off their heads; wash them 
clean, and dry them in a cloth ; then dust them well 
vdth flour, and broil them. Take the heads, mash 
them, and boil them in small beer or ale, with a little ^ 
whole pepper and onion. When it is boiled a quarter

The mode of fiying sausages is so simple, and ge-- 
nerally known, that it needs no description. How- 
ever, we shall notice q^e way of which the cook may 
not be informed. Take six apples, and slice four of 
them as thick as a crown piece : cut the other two into 
quarters, and take the cores clean out. Fry the slices 
with the sausages till they are of a nice light brown 
colour. When done put the sausages into the middle 
of the dish, and the apples round them. Garnish 
with the apples quartered. • 

Chickens. 

Cut your chickens into quarters, and rub them 
with the yolk of an egg ; then strew on some crumbs 
of bread, with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and le- 
mon-peel, and chopped parsley. Fry them in butter, 
and when done put them into your dish before the fire. 
For sauce thicken some gravy with a little flour, and 
put into it a small quantity of chyan pepper, some 
mushroom powder or catsup, and a little lemon-juice. 
When it is properly heated, pour it over the chickens, 
and serve it up. 

Artichoke Bottoms, 

Blanch them in water, then flour them, and 
firy them in firesh butter. Lay them in your dish, and 
pour melted butter over them for sauce. Or you 
may put a little red wine into the butter, and season 
with nutm^, pepper, and salt. 

' Celery. 

Take six or eight heads of fresh celery, and cut 
q^ the green tops with the outside stalks. Wash 
them well and have the roots clean. Have ready a 
pint of white wine, the yolks of three eggs beat fine, 
and a little salt and nutmeg. Mix all well together 
with flour, and make it into a batter, then dip every 
head into it, put them into a pan, and fiy them with 
butter. When enough lay them in your dish, and 
pour melted butter over them for sauce.

Potatoes 

Cut your potatoes into thin slices, and fiy them 
in butter till they are nicely brown. Then lay them in 
a dish or plate, and ponr melted butter over them for 
sauce. 

Potatoes are likewise fried by the French in batter, 
and served up with powdered sugar thrown over them. 
You must fry all yom* batter in sweet oil or hog's 
lard. Any kind of fruit may be fried in the same 
manner, and served up as a coiner dish in the second 
course. 



SECT. 11. 

FRYING FISH. 

As a necessary prelude to our directions for frying 
fish, it may not be improper to make the few following 
general observations : When you fry any kind of fish, 
first dry them in a cloth, and then flour them. Put 
into your frying-pan plenty of dripping or hog's lard, 
and let it boil before you put it into a dish. When 
they are properly fried, . lay them in a dish, or hair 
sieve, to drain. If you fiy parsley, be sure to pick it 
very cautiously, wash it well, dip it into cold water, 
and throw it into a pan of boiling fat. This wiU make 
it very crisp, and of a fine green, provided you do not 
let it remain too long in the pan ; but this you may 
prevent by its appearance while doing. 

Turbot. 

Having properly cleansed your fish (which in this 
mode of dressing must be small) and thoroughly dried 
it, strew on some flour, and put it into your pan, with 
a sufficient quantity of hot lard to cover it. When it 
is firied nice and brown, take it carefully out, and tho- 
roughly drain the fat firom it. In the meantime clean 
the pan, put into it as much claret and white wine as 
will nearly cover the fish, with an anchovy, salt, nut- 
m^, and a little ginger. Put in the turbot, and 
let it remain in the liquor till it is half wasted ; then 



FISH. 83 

f 

take it out, and put in apiece of butter roUed in flour, 
and a minced lemon. Let them siknmer together till 
of a proper thickness, then rab a hot dish with a 
piece of shalot, lay the tm*bot in the dish, pomr over 
the sauce, and serve it up. Yoti may likewise add 
plain melted butter in a basin. 

After having cleansed your fish, lay them in a 
cloth to dry, then flour them, put them into the pan, 
and fry them of a light brown. Take some crusts of 
bread, cut them three comer ways, and fry them with 
the roes of the fish. When yoxu: fish are nicely fried, 
lay them on a coarse cloth to drain, and prepare an- 
chovy sauce with the juice of a lemon. Lay your 
carp in the dish, with the roes on each side, and gar- 
nish with the fiied crust, and slices of lemon. 

Tench. 

Split the fish along the backs, and raise the flesh 
from the bone : then cut the skin across at the head 
and tail, strip it clean off*, and take out the bone. 
Having thus prepared them for filing, take one of 
them, and mince the flesh very small, with mush- 
rooms, chives, and parsley chopped fine; a Httle salt, 
pepper, beaten mace, nutmeg, and a few savory herbs. 
Mix these well together, then pound tiiem in a mor- 
tar and crumbs of bread soaked in cream, the yolks 
of three or four eggs, and a piece of butter ; and with 
this composition stuff your fish. Put clarified butter 
into your pan, set it over the fire, and when it is 
hot sixew some flour on your fish, and put them in one 
by one. When they have fiied till they are of a nice 
brovni colour, take them up, and lay them in a coarse 
doth befi>re the fire to keep hot. Then pour all the 
fat out of the pan, put in a quarter of a pound of but- 
ter, and shake in some flour. Keep it sirring with 
a spoon till the butter is a little brown, and then put 
in half a pint of white wine. Stir them together, 
and put in half a pint of boiling water, an onion 
shred with cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, and two 



84 FRTINO 

blades of mace. Cover these close, and let them stew 
as gently as you can for a quarter of an hour, then 
strain off the liquor, and put them into the pan again, 
adduig two spoonsfiil of catsup, an ounce of tnifBes 
or morels boiled tender in halt a pint of water, a few 
mushrooms, and half a pint of oysters, washed clean 
in their own liquor. When your sauce is properly heat- 
ed, and has a good flavour, put in your tench, and let 
them lay in it till they are thoroughly hot j then tafce 
them out, lay them in your dish, and pour the sauce 
over them. Garnish with sliced lemon. The same 
methods may be used in frying of carp. 

Soles. 
Take off the skin, rub the fish over with the yolk 
of an egg, and strew on some crumbs of bread. Fry 
them in hog's lard over a brisk fire, till they are of a 
fine light brown. Then take them up, drain them, 
put them into your dish, and serve them up with plain 
melted butter in a boat. Garnish with green pickles. 

Smelts. 
Be carefiil to take away the giUs, but leave in the 
roes. After you have washed them, dry them well in 
a cloth, then beat up an egg very fine, rub it over them 
with a feather, and strew on crumbs of bread. Fry 
them in hogs lard over a brisk fire, and put them 
in when the fat is boiling hot. When they are 
done of a fine bro^vn, take them out, and drain the fat 
from them, and when you dish them up, put a basin 
with the bottom upwards, into the middle of your 
dish, and lay the tmls of your fish on the side of it. 
Garnish with firied parsley. 

Eels. 

After having properly cleaned them, and taken 
off the heads, cut them into pieces, season them with 
pepper and salt, strew on some flour, and firy them till 
they are of a fine brown colour. Drain them properly 
before you lay them in the dish. Serve them up with 
melted butter and the juice of a lemon squeessed into 
it. Garnish with crisped parsley. 



F16H. 86 

Lampreys. 

When you cut them open to clean them, be care- 
fal to save the blood, and wash them thoroughly clean 
in warm water. Fry them in clean dripping, and 
when nearly enoogh, put out the fat, put a little white 
wine, and give the pan a shake round. Throw a lit- 
tle pepper, with some sweet herbs, a few capers, a 
fnece of butter rolled in flour, and the blood you saved 
irom the fish. Cover the pan close, and shake it 
often. When they are enough, take them out, strain 
the sauce, put it into the pan again, and give it a quick 
boil. Squeeze in the juice of a lemon, stir all together, 
and when it is just upon the boil, pour it over the fish, 
and serve it up. Garnish with sliced lemon. 

Mullets. 

Score the fish across the back, and dip them in 
melted butter. Fry them in butter clarified, and when 
enough, lay them on a warm dish. Serve them up 
with plain melted butter or anchovy sauce. 

Herrings. 

First scrape off all the scales, then wash them 
dry them well in a cloth, and dredge them with flour. 
Fry them in butter over a brisk fire, and when done, 
set their tails up one against another in the middle of 
the dish. Fry a large handfiil of parsley crisp, take 
it out before it loses its colour ; lay it round the fish, 
and serve them up with melted butter, parsley, and 
mustard. 

Oysters, 

The largest oysters you can get should be chosen 
for firying. When you have properly cleaned and rin- 
sed them, strew over them a little grated nutmeg, a 
blade of mace pounded, a spoonful of flour, and a lit- 
tle salt. Dip your oysters singly into this, and fry 
them in hog s lard till they are of a nice brown co- 
lour. Then take them out of the pan, pour them into 
your dish, and pour over them a little melted butter, 
with crumbs of bread mixed.

case a ragout composed of large hvers, mushrooms, 
and streaked bacon, all cut in small dice, and mingled 
with salt, fine spices, and shred parsley and onions. 
Sew the turkey up, but take care to shape it nicely ; 
then put a thin slice of bacon upon the breast, and 
vrrap it in a cloth. Stew it in a pot, but not too large

adding a spoonful of cuUis ; then unwrap your turkey, 
take off the bacon, dry away the grease, and serve 
it up with the sauce. 

Fowls. 

Pursue the same method, at first, in stewing fowls 
as you do turkeys ; that is to say, put skewers cross- 
ways at the bottom of your stew-pan. When you 
have laid in your fowl, put to it a quart of gravy, a 
bunch of celery clean washed and cut very small, with 
two or three blades of mace. Let it stew gently till 
the liquor is reduced to a quantity only sufficient for 
sauce ; ' then add a large piece of butter rolled in flour.

then take them out and thicken the gravy. Boil it 
a little, and pour it over the partridges, and lay round 
them artichoke bottoms boiled and cut in quarters, 
and the yolks of four hard eggs. Woodcocks must be 
stewed in the same manner. * 

Cucumbers. 

Pare twelve middle sized cucumbers, slice them 
about the thickness of half a crown, and lay them in a 
coarse cloth to drain. When quite dry, flour them, 
and fry them in fresh butter tUl they are brown ; then 
take them out with an egg-shce, and lay them on a 
plate before (he fire. Take a large cucumber, cut a 
long piece out of the sidfe, and scoop out all the pulp. 
Have ready some onions nicely firied, fiU the cucumber 
with these, and season with pepper and salt ; then put 
in the piece that was cut out, and tie it round with 
packthread. Flour it, and &y it till it is brown ; then 
take it out of the pan. and keep it hot. Let the pan

Peas and Lettuce. 

Put a quart of green peas, and two large lettuces 
washed clean, and cut small across, into a stew-pan, 
with a quart of gravy, and stew them till they are ten- 
der. Put in a piece of butter rolled in flour, and sea- 
son with pepper and salt. When of a proper thick- 
ness, dish them up, and send them to table. Instead 
of butter you may thicken them with the yolks of four 
^gs, and if you put two or three thin rashers of lean 
ham at the bottom of the stew-pan, it will give the 
whole a very fine flavour.

quantity of red wine, a large spoonfiil of lemon-pickle, 
another of browning, a little mushroom-powder, chy- 
an pepper, a large onion stuck with cloves, and a stick 
of horse-radish. (If carp, add the blood, which 
you must be careful to save when you kill them.) 
Cover your pan close to keep in the steam ; and let 
them stew gently over a slow fire till your gravy is re- 
duced to just enough to cover them. Then take the 
fish out, and put them into the dish you intend for ta- 
ble. Set the gravy again on the fire, and thicken it 
with A large lump of butter rolled in flour : boil it a lit-

butter and flour, pour it over the fish, and serve it up. 

Small Barbel. 
The small barbel is stewed like a carp, and when 
large may be done on the gridiron, served up with a 
white sauce. 

Trout. 

Make a stuffing with grated bread, a piece of but* 
ter, chopped parsley, lemon-peel grated, pepper, salt, 
nutmeg, savory herbs, and the yolk of an egg, all well 
mixed together. Fill the belly of your fish with this, 
and then put it into a stew-pan with a quart of good 
boiled gravy, half a pint of Madeira wine, an onion, a 
little whole pepper, a few cloves, and a piece of lemon-- 
peel. Stew it very gently over a slow fire, and when 
done, take out the fish, and add to the sauce a little 
flour mixed in some cream, a little catsup, and the 
juice of a lemon. Let it just boil up, then strain it 
over your fish, and serve it up. 

Pike. 
Make a browning with butter and flour, and put it 
into vour stew-pan with a pint of red wine, a fag- 
got, tour cloves, a dozen of small onions half boiled,,

put it in, and let it stew very gently. When done, take 
it out, and add to the sauce two anchovies and a 
spoonful of capers chopped fine. Boil it (or a minute 
or two, and then pour it over the fish. Garnish with 
bread nicely fried, and cnt three-oomer wap.

A Fricandeau of Pike. 

Cut a pike into slices, according to its s£se ; after 
having scaled, gutted, and washed it, lard all the tipper 
part with bacon cut small, and put it into a stew-pan 
with a glass of white wine, some eood broth, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, and some fillet of veal cut into small 
dice : when it is stewed, and the sauce strained off, 
glaze it like other fricandeaus. It may also be fiica- 
seed like chickens (as a side dish); or you may stew it, 
and serve it up with a white sauce. 

Cod. 

Cut some sUces of cod, as for boiling, and season 
them with grated nutmeg, pepper, salt, and sweet 
herbs. Put them into a stew-pan with half a pint of 
white wine and a quarter of a pint of water. Cover 
them close, and let them simmer for five or six minutes. 
Then squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and add a few 
oysters with their liquor strained, a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, and a blade or two of mace. Let them 
stew very gently, and frequently shake the pan to pre- 
vent its burning. When the fish is done, take out 
the onion and sweet herbs, lay the cod in a warm dish, 
aDd strain the sanoe over it. 

SoleSy Plaice, and Flounders. 

The same methods must be taken for stewing either 
of these kinds of fish. Half fiy them in butter, then 
take them out of the pan, and put to the butter a quart 
of water, two anchovies, and an onion sliced. When 
they have boiled slowly for about a quarter of an hour, 
put your fish in again, and let them stew gently about 
twenty minutes ; then take out the fish, and thicken 
the sauce with butter and flour. Give the whole a 
gentle boil, then strain it through a hair-sieve over the 
fish, and serve them up with oyster, cockle, or shrimp 
sauce. 

Lampreys and Eels. 

Having skinned, gutted, and thoroughly washed 
your fish, season them with salt, pepper, a little lemon- 



riSH. 97 

peel shred fine, mace, cloves, and nutm^. Put some 
thin slices of butter into your stew-pan, and having 
rolled your fish round, put them in, with half a pint of 
good gravy, a gill of white wine, a bunch of marjorum, 
winter savory, thyme, and an onion sliced. Let them 
stew over a gentle fire, and keep turning them till they 
are tender. Then take them out, and put an anchovy 
into the sauce. Thicken it with the yolk of an egg 
beat very fine, or a piece of butter rolled in flour. When 
it boils, pour it over the fish, and serve them to table. 

Prawns, Shrimps, and Cray-fish. 

Take about two quarts of either of these fish, and 
pick out the tails. Put the bodies into your stew-pan, 
with about a pint of white wine (or water with a spoon- 
fol of vinegar) and a blade of mace. Stew these a 
quarter of an hour, then stir them together, and strain 
them. Having done this, wash out your pan, and put 
into it the strained liquor and tails. Grate into it a 
small nutmeg, put in a little salt, a quarter of a pound 
of batter rolled in flour, and shake it all together. Cut 
a tliin slice of bread round a quartern loaf, toast it 
brown on both sides, cut it into six pieces, lay it close 
together in the bottom of your dish, pour your fish and 
sauce hot over it, and send it hot to table. If cray- 
fisb» garnish the dish vrith some of their biggest daws 
laid thick round. 

Oysters. 

Strain the liquor of your oysters, and put it into 
your saucepan with a little beaten mace, and thicken 
it with flour and butter. Boil this three or four mi- 
nutes, then toast a slice of bread, cut it in three-cor- 
nered pieces, and lay them round the dish into which 
yon intend to put the oysters. Then put into the pan 
^ spoonful 01 cream with your oysters, shake them 
round, and let them stew till they are quite hot, but 
be careful they do not boil. Pour them into a deep 
plate or soup-dish* and serve theit) up. Most kinds of 
aliell-fish may be stewed in the same manner.

Oysters scolloped. 

Wash them thoroughly clean in their own liquor, 
and then put them into your scollop shells ; strew over 
them a few crumbs of bread. Lay a slice of butter on 
the first you put in, then more oysters, and bread and 
butter successively till the shell is full. Put them into 
a Dutch oven to brown, and serve them up hot in the 
shells. 

Muscles. 

Wash them very clean in several waters, then put 
them into a stew-pan, and cover them close. Let them 
stew till the sheUs open, and then pick out the fish 
clean, one by one. Look under the tongue to see if 
there be a crab, and if you find one, throw that muscle 
awaiy. You will Ukewise find a little tough article 
under the tongue, which you must pick off. Having 
thus properly cleansed them, put them into a sauce* 

{>an, and to a quart of muscles, put half a pint of the 
iquor strained through a sieve ; add a few blades of 
mace, a small piece of butter rolled in flour, and let 
them stew gently. Lay some toasted bread in the 
dish, and when the muscles are done, pour them on 
it, and serve them up.

BUTCHER'S MEAT. 

Calf's Head. 

AS a whole calf's head is rather too large for the 
consumption of most families at one time, and as we 
mean to confine our receipts within socb coiApass as 
may with equal convenience and pleasure suit all, so 
we shall here give directions for only hashing ane-'half, 
observing that should th^e be occasion for doing the 
whole, it is only doubling the ingredients here givesk 
for a part. 



MKAT. 99 

Wash the head as clean as possihle, and then boil 
it a qnarter of an hour. When cold, cut the meat, as 
also tiie tongue, into thin broad slices, and put them 
into a stewing-pan, with a quart of good gravy. When 
it has stewed three quarters of an hour, put in an an- 
chovy, a little beaten mace, chyan pepper, two spoons- 
ful of lemon-pickle, the same quantity of walnut cat- 
sup, half an ounce of truffles and morels, a slice or two 
of lemon, some sweet herbs, and a glass of white wine. 
Mix a quarter of a pound of butter with some flour, 
and put it in a few minutes before the meat is done. 
In the mean time put the brains into hot water, and 
beat them fine in a basin ; then add two eggs, a 
spoonful of flour, a bit of lemon-peel shred fine, and a 
little parsley, thyme, and sage chopped small. Beat 
them all well together, and strew in a little pepper and 
salt ; then drop them in little cakes into a pan with 
boiling lard ; fry them of a light brown, and lay them 
on a sieve to drain. Take your hash out of your pan 
with a fish slice, and lay it in your dish. Strain your 
gravy over it, and lay upon it a few mushrooms, force- 
meat balls, the yolks of two eggs boiled hard, and the 
brain cakes. Garnish with sliced lemon and pickles. 
If the company is so large that there should be a ne- 
cessity for dressing the whole head, in order to make 
a pleasing variety, do the other half thus : When it is 
parboiled, hack it cross and cross with a knife, and 
grate some nutmeg all over it. Take the yolks of two 
eggs, a little salt and pepper, a few sweet-herbs, some 
crumbs of bread, and a little lemon-peel chopped very 
fine. Strew this over the head, and then put it into 
a deep dish before a good fire. Baste it with butter, 
and keep the dish turning till all parts are equally 
brown. Then take it up, and lay it on your hash. 
Blanch the half of the tongue, and lay it on a soup 
plate ; boil the brains with a little sage and parsley, 
chop them fine, and mix them with some melted but- 
ter, and a spoonful of cream, make it quite hot, then 
pour it over the tongue, and serve it up with the head. 
The mode of doing this half is usually termed grilling. 



100 HASHIlfO 

Veal Minced. 

First cut your veal into thin slices, and then into 
small bits. Put it into a saucepan with half a pint of 
gravy, a little pepper and salt, a slice of lemon, a good 
piece of butter rolled in flour, a tea-spoonful of lemon- 
pickle, and a large spoonful of cream. — Keep shaking 
it over the fire till it boils, have sippets of bread ready 
in the dish, and then pour the whole over them. Gar* 
nish with sliced lemon. 

Mutton Hashed. 

Cut your meat into small pieces, as thin as possi- 
ble ; then boil the bones with an onion, a few sweet 
herbs, a blarfe of mace, a very little whole pepper, a 
little salt, and a piece of crust toasted very crisp. Let 
it boil till there is just enough for sauce ; then strain it, 
and put it into a saucepan, with a piece of butter rol- 
led in flour ; then put in the meat, and when it is very 
hot it is enough. Season with pepper and salt. Have 
ready some thin bread toasted brown and cut three 
comer ways, lay them in the dish, and pour over the 
hash. Garnish with pickles and horse-radish.

HASHING POULTRY and GAME. 

Turkeys. 

Cut the flesh into pieces, and take ofi* all the skin, 
othervrise it will give the gravy a greasy disagreeable 
taste. Put it into a stew-pan with a pint of gra^T, a 
tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle, a slice of the end of a 
lemon, and a little beaten mace. Let it boil about six 
or seven minutes, and then put it into your dish. 
Thicken your gravy with flour and butter, mix the 
yolks of two eggs with a spoonful of thick cream, put 
it into your gravy, and shake it over the fire till it is 
quite hot, but do not let it boil ; then strain it» and 
pour it over your turkey. Lay sippets round, serve it 
up, and garnish with lemon and parsley^ 



I^OULTRT* ^C. 101 

Or you may do it thus: 

Cut the remains of a roasted turkey into pieces, 
and put them into a stew-pan with a glass oi white 
wine, chopped parsley, shalots, mushrooms, truffles, 
salt, and pepper, and about half a pint of broth. Let it 
boil half an hour, wliich will be sufficient to do it ; then 
add a pounded anchovy and a squeeze of lemon. 
Scum the fat clear from the sauce, then pour the whole 
into, your dish over sippets made of toasted bread cut 
thui. ' Garnish with sliced lemon. 

Fowls. 

Cut up your fowl as for eating, then put it into a 
stew-pan with half a pint of gravy, a tea-spoonful of 
lemon-pickle, a little catsup and a slice of lemon. 
Thicken it with flom* and butter ; and just before you 
dish it up, put in a spoonful of good cream. Lay 
sippets in the dish, and pour the hash over them. 

Chickens. 

Cut a cold chicken into pieces, and if you have no 
gravy, make a little with the long bones, onion, spice, 
&c. Flour the chicken, and put into the gravy, with 
white pepper, salt, nutmeg, and grated lemon. When 
it boils, stir in an egg, and mix it with a Uttle cream. 
As soon as it is thoroughly hot, squeeze in a little 
lemon-juice, then put the whole mto a dish, strew 
over it some crumbs of bread, brown them with a 
salamander, and then serve it up hot to table. 

Partridges or Woodcocks. 

Having cut it up in the usual manner as when 
first brought to the table, work the entrails very fine 
with the back of a spoon, put in a spoonful of red wine, 
the same of water, and half a spoonful of vinegar; 
cut an onion in slices, and put it into rings ; roll a 
little butter in flour, put them all into your pan, and 
shake it over the fire till it boils ; then put in your 
bird, and when it is thoroughly hot, lay it in your dish, 
with sippets round it. Strain the sauce over the bird, 



102 HAlHIire POUI.TBT» ^c. 

and lay the onions in rings. This will make a ddi- 
cate dish for two people either for dinner or sapper ; 
and where there is a large company is an ornamental 
addition to other articles provided. 

Wild Ducks. 

Cut up your duck in the usual manner^ then put it 
into a pan, with a spoonful of good gravy, the same of 
red wine, and an onion sliced exceeding thin. When 
it has boiled two or three minutes, lay the duck in the 
dish, and pour the gravy over it. You may add a tea- 
spoonful ot caper liquor, or a little browning. 

Hares. 

Cut your hare into small pieces, and if you have 
any of the pudding left, rub it small, and put to it a 
gill of red wine, the same quantity of water, half an 
anchovy chopped fine, an onion stuck with four 
doves, and a quarter of a pound of butter rolled in 
flour. Put these all together into a saucepan, and set 
it over a slow fire, shaking it at times that the whole 
may be equally heated. When it is thoroughly hot 
(for you must not let any kind of hash boil, as it will 
harden the meat) take out the onion, lay sippets in 
and round the dish, pour in your hash, and serve it 
hot to table. 

Hare Jugged. 

After you have cut your hare into small pieces, 
lard them here and there with very thin slips of 
bacon ; season them with a little pepper and salt, and 
put them into an earthen jug, with a blade or two of 
mace, an onion stuck widi cloves, and a bunch of 
sweet herbs. Cover the jug close, that the steam may 
be retdned ; set it in a pot of boiling water, and about 
three hom's will do it. Then turn it out of the jug 
into the dish, take out the onion and sweet herbs, and 
send it hot to table. With respect to the larding, it 
may be used or omitted, at your own discretion. Gar- 
nish with sliced lemon. 



Vtnison. 

Cut your venison into very thin slices, and put it 
into a stewii^-pan, with a large glass of red wine, a 
spoonfiil of catsup, the same of browning, an onion

as directed for soles, only let the pieces of each consist 
of six instead of eight. Dry your fish well, then sprin- 
kle them with salt, dredge them with flour, and fi-y 
them in a pan of hot beef dripping, so that the fish may 
be crisp. When so done, take them out of the pan, 
drain the fat firom them, and set them before the fire

When it has stewed till it is quite tender, put in the 
asparagus, shake the saucepan, and let it simmer till 
the grass is enough. Take the three heads of endive 
•out of the water, drsdn them, and leave the largest 
whole. Pull the others asunder, leaf by leaf, and put 
them into the stew-pan, with a pint w white wine. 
Cover the pan close, and let it boil till the endive is just

and boil it about five minutes. Then drain it, cut the 
stalk flat to stand in a dish, carefiilly open the leaves, 
and take out the inside, leaving the outside leaves 
whole. Cut what you take out very fine : then take 
the flesh of two or three flounders or plaice, and chop 
it with the cabbage, the volks and whites of four ejgs 
boiled hard, and a handml of picked parsley. Beat 
all together in a mortar with a quarter of a pound of 
melted butter. Then mix it up with the yolk of an

CHAPTER XL 

GRAVIES, CULX.ISES, and other SAUCES. 

IN the preceding chapters we have, where a proper 
opportunity offered, directed the necessary sauces to 
be made for each respective article ; but as there are 
many others which are used for diflerent purposes, 
and on various occasions, we shall place them in the 
present chapter, beginning with 

Gravies. 

To make beef gravy, take a piece of the chuck, or 
neck, and cut it into small pieces ; then strew some 
flour over it, mix it well with the meat, and put it 
into the saucepan, with as much water as will cover 
it, an onion, a little allspice, a little pepper, and 
some salt. Cover it close, and when it boils take off 
the scum, then throw in a hard crust of bread, or

of all are pretty well extracted, then take out all your 
meat and roots with a skimmer, pot in a few cnmifas 
of bread, and let it stew sofUy. Take the white part 
of a youngfowl, and pomid it in a mortar till it is very 
fine, put this into your cullis, but do not let it boil ; u 
it does not appear suiffidently white, you must add two 
dozen of blanched almonds. When it has stewed till 
it is of a good rich taste, strain it off. 

A Cullisfor Fish. 

Broil a jack or pike tfll it is properly done, then 
take off the skin, and separate the flesh from the bones. 
Boil six eggs hard, and take out the yolks ; blanch a 
few almonds, beat them to a paste in a mortar, and then 
add the yolks of the eggs : mix these well with butter, 
then put in the fish, and pound all together. Then 
take half a dozen of onions, and cut them into slices, 
two parsnips, and three carrots. Set on a stew-pan, 
put into it a piece of butter to brown, and when it boils 
put in the roots ; turn them till they are brown, and

pan ; then put in a whole leek, some parsley, sweet- 
basil, half a dozen cloves, some mushrooms and tmfSes, 
and a few crumbs of bread. When it has stewed 
gently a quarter of an hour, put in the fish, &c. Stom

ley, a crust of bread, and a leek. Cover it down close, 
and vflxen it has simmered tillit is of a good thickness 
and flavour, strain it off. If you have preserved the 
gravy from a dressed ham. you may ui^ it Avith the

which will make it equaUy good, but not quite so high 
flavoured. 

A Sauce for Lamb. 

Takb a bit of butter, and mix it with shred pars- 
ley, shalots, and a little crumb of bread grated very 
fine. Put the whole into a stew-pan with a glass of

*- Lemon PicMe. 

Take about a score of lemons^ grate off the out- 
rinds very thin, and cut them into quarters, but leave 
the bottoms whole. Rub on them equally half a pound 
of bay-salt, and spread them on a large pewter dish. 
Either put them in a cool oven, or let them dry gradu- 
ally by the fire, till the juice is all dried into the peels ; 
then put them into a well glazed pitcher, with an 
ounce of mace, and half an ounce of cloves beat 
fine, an ounce of nutmeg cut into thin slices, four 
ounces of garlic peeled, half a pint of mustard^seed 
bruised a little, and tied in a' muslin bag. Pour 
upon them two quarts of boiling white wine vine- 
gar, close the pitcher well up, and let it stand five 
or six days by the fire. Shake it well up every day, 
then tie it close, and let it stand three months to take 
off the bitter. When you bottle it, put the pickle and 
lemon into a hair sieve, press them well to get out the 
liquor, and let it stand tUl another day ; then pour off 
the fine, and bottle it. Let the other stand three or 
four days, and it will refine itself. Pour it off and bot- 
tle it, let it stand again, and bottle it till the whole is re- 
fined. It may be put into any white sauce and vdll not 
hurt the colour. It is very good for fish sauce and made 
dishes. One tea-spoonful is enough for white, and two 
for brown sauce tor a fowl. It is a most usefiil pic- 
kle, and gives a pleasant flavour. Always put it in be- 
fore you thicken the sauce, or put any cream in, lest the 
sharpness should make it curdle.

pepper, and a little grated nutmeg. Mix. up aU toge- 
ther with an egg and a little cream ; and with this 
forcemeat fill up the place fi-om whence the bone was 
taken. Then make cuts all round the fillet at about 
an inch distance fi-om each other. Fill one nich with 
forcemeat, a second with spinach that has been well 
boiled and squeezed, and a third with crnmbs of bread» 
chopped oysters, and beef marrow, and tlms fill up the 
holes round the fillet ; wrap the caul close round it, 
and put it into a deep pot, with a pint of water. Make 
a coarse paste to lay over it, in order to prevent the oven 
giving it a disagreeable taste. When it is taken out 
of the oven, skim oS the fat, and put the gravy into a 
stew-pan, with a spoonfiil of mushroom catsup, anoth^ 
of lemon-pickle, five boiled artichoke bottoms cut into 
quarters, two spoonsful of brovvning, and half an ounce

Fricandeau of VeaL 

Take the thick part of the leg of veal, shape it 
nicely oval, lard it well, and put it into boiling water. 
Let it boil up once, then take it out, and put into your 
8tew-pan some shces of veal, roots, sweet herbs, with 
salt, pepper, and mace. Put in half a pint of gravy, 
then put in your firicandeau, covering it with some pep- 
per and butter. Let it go gently on for three hours, 
then take it out and glaze it. You may serve it with 
sorrel sauce, which is almost always used, or glazed 
onions, or endive sauce. If the larded firicandeau lies 
a few hours in water, it will be a great deal the whiter. 

Veal Olives. 

Cut some large collopsoff a fillet of veal, and hack 
them well with the back of a knife. Spread very thin- 
ly forcemeat over each, then roll them up, and either

brown gravy into the dish, and send them up hot, with 
forcemeat balls round them. Garnish with lemon. 

Chrenadines of Veal. 

These are done the same as the fricandeau, ex- 
cepting that the veal is cut into slices. Three pieces 
make a dish ; and they are served, with the same 
sauces. 

Veal Cutlets en PapUotes. 

Cut them thin, and put them in square pieces of 
white paper, with salt, pepper, parsley, shalots, mush-

lets upon the gridiron over a slow fire, with a sheet of 
buttered paper under them. Serve them in the papers. 

Porcupine of a Breast of Veal.

and lay over it a little bacon cut as thin as possible, a 
handful of parsley shred fine, the yolks of five hard 
boiled eggs chopped small, a little lemon-peel cut fine, 
the crumb of a penny loaf steeped in cream, and sea- 
son to your taste with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Roll 
the breast of veal close, and skewer it up. Then cut 
some fat bacon, the lean of ham that has been a little 
boUed, and pickled encumbers, about two inches long. 
Lard the veal with this in rows, first ham, tiien bacon, 
and then cucumbers, till you have larded every part of 
it. Put it into a deep earthen pot, with a pint of^ water, 
cover it close, and set it in a slow oven for two hours. 
When it comes from the oven, skim off the fat, and 
strain the gravy through a sieve into a stew-pan. Put

eel, bind it in a cloth, and boil it an hour. This done, 
cut it into four slices, lay one at each end and the 
others on the sides. Have ready your sweet-bread 
cut in slices and fiied, and lay them round it witli a

Fricandeau of Veal a-la-Baurgeais. 

Cut some lean veal into thin slices, lard them with 
streaked bacon, and season them with pepper, salt, 
beaten mace, cloves, nutmeg, and chopped parsley.

and no more. Then with a brisk fire, brown your veal 
on both sides, and shake, some flour over it. Pour in 
a quart of good broth or gravy, cover it close, and let it 
stew gently till it is enoi:^h. Then take out the slices 
of bacon, skim eSi the fat off clean, and beat up the 
yolks of three eggs, with some of the gravy. Mix all

into a very quick oven. When you take it out, lay 
your head in a soup-dish, skim off the fat from the 
gravy, and strain it through a hair sieve into a stew*

down the back, and take the dkin o£f the whole ; 
cut the flesh from the bones, and chop it with half a 
pint of oysters, one ounce of beef marrow, and a lit- 
tle pepper and salt. Mix it up with cream ; then lay 
the meat on the bones, draw the skin over it, and sew 
up the back. Cut large thin slices of bacon, lay them 
on the breast of your fowl, and tie them on with pack- 
thread in disimonds. . It will take an hour roasting by 
amoderate fire. Make a good brown gravy sauce, pour 
it into your dish, take the bacon off, lay in your fowl, and 
serve it up. Garnish with pickles, mushrooms, or oys- 
ters. It is proper for a side-dish at dinner, or top-dish

piece of butter rolled in flour, and, if wanted, some pep 
per and salt. Put the goose in again, cover it close, 
and let it stew half an hour longer. Then take it up, 
pour the ragpo over it, and garnish with lemon. You 
must remember to save the bones of the goose and 
fowl, and put them into the gravy when it is first set 
on. It will be an improvement if you roll some beef 
marrow between the tongue and the fowl, and between 
the fowl and the goose, as it will make them mellow, 
and eat the finer.

in the mouth. Strain your sauce over it, and gamiflh 
with barberries and parsley. 

Florendine Rabbits. 

Skin three young rabbits, but leave on the ears, 
and wash and dry them with a cloth. Take out the 
bones as carefully as you can,, but leave the head 
whole, and proceed in the same manner as before di- 
rected tor the hare. Have ready a white sauce made 
of veal gravy, a little anchovy, and the juice of half ^ 
lemon, or a tea-spoonful of lemon-pickle. Qtxain it, 
and then put in a quarter of a pound of butter rolled ii^ 
flour, so as to make the sauce pretty thick. Beat up 
the yolk of an egg, put to it'some thick cream, nutmeg, 
and salt, and mix it with the gravy. Let it simmer a

mortar : then mix all together, and put it into a stew- 
pan. Having stewed it five minutes, lay it on the rab- 
bits, where you took the meat off, and put it close 
down with your hand, to make tliem appear like 
whole rabbits. Then with a salamander brown them 
all over. Pour a good brown gravy, made as thick as 
cream, into the dish, and stick a bunch of myrtle in 
their mouths. Send them up to table, with their livers 
boiled and frothed. 

Rabbits en Casserole. 

Cut your rabbits into quarters, and then lard them 
or not, just as yon please. Shake some flour over them, 
and fry them in lard or butter. Then put them into 
an earthen pipkin, with a quart of good broth, a glass 
of white wine, a little pepper and salt, a bunch of 
sweet herbs, and a small piece of butter rolled in flour. 
Cover them close, and let them stew half an hour; 
then dish them up, and pour the sauce over them. 
Garnish with Seville oranges cut into thin slices and 
notched. 

Macaroni. 

Broil £>ur ounces of macaroni till it is quite tender, 
tlien lay it on a sieve to drain, and put it into a stew- 
pan, with about a gill of cream, and a piece of butter 
rolled in flour. Boil it five minutes, pour it on a plate. 
Lay Parmasan cheese roasted all over it, and send it 
up in a water-plate. 

Amulets. 

Take six eggs, beat them up as fine as you can, 
strain them through a hair sieve, and put them into a 
frying-pan, in which must be a quarter of a pound of 
hot butter. Throw in a little ham scraped fine, with 
shred parsley, and season them with pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg. Fry it brown on the under side, and lay it 
on your dish, but do not tarn it. Hold a hot salaman- 
der over it for half a minute, to take ofl* the raw 



VEGBTABL&8, ^. 165 

kxk of the ^s. Stick curled patdey in it, and servd 
it up. 

Amulets of Asparagus. 

Beat up sue eggs with cream, boil some of the 
largest and finest asparagus, and, when boiled, cut off 
all the green in small pieces. Mix them with the 
eggs, and put in some pepper and salt. Make a slice 
of butter hot in the pan, put them in, and serve them 
up on buttered toast. 

Oyster Loaves. 

Make a hole in the top of some little round loaves, 
and take out all the crumb. Put some oysters into a 
stew-pan, with the oyster liquor, and the crumbs that 
were taken out of the loaves, and a large piece of but- 
ter ; stew them together five or six minutes, then put in 
a spoonful of good cream, then fill your loaves. Lay a 
bit of crust carefiilly on the top of each, and put them 
in the oven to crisp. 

Mushroom Loaves. 

Take some small buttons, and wash them as fi>r 
pickling. Boil them a few minutes in a little water, 
and put to them two large spoonsful of cream, with a 
bit of butter rolled in flour, and a little salt and pepper. 
Boil these up, then fill your loaves, and do them in the 
same manner as directed in the preceding article. 

I^gs in Surtotit. 

Boil half apound of bacon cut into thin slices, and 
fi'y some bits oi bread in butter; put three spoonsfiilof 
cullis into your dish, garnish the rim with firied bread, 
break some eggs in the middle, cover them with the 
rashers of bacon, and do them over a slow fire. 

Eggs and Broccoli. 

Boil your broccoli tender, observing to save a large 
bunch fi>r the middle, and six or eight little thick sprigs 
to stick round. Toast a bit of bread as large as you 
would have it for your dish or batter plate. Butter 
some eggs, thus : take six ^gs or as many as yoa 



166 VC^ETABLES. 

have occasion for, beat them well, pat them into a 
saucepan, with a good piece of batter and a little salt; 
keep beating them with a spoon till they are thick 
enough, and then pour them on the toast. Set the 
largest bunch of broccoli in the middle, and the other 
littie pieces round and about Garnish the dish with 
little sprigs of broccoli. This is a pretty side dish or 
comer plate. 

Spinach and Eqgs. 

Pick and wash your spinach very clean in several 
waters, then put it into a saucepan with a little salt ; 
cover it close, and shake the pan often. When it is 
just tender, and whilst it is green, throw it into a sieve 
to drain, and then lay it in your dish. Have ready a 
stew-pan of water boiling, and break &s many eggs in- 
to cups as you would poach. When the water boils 
put in the eggs, have an egg slice ready to take them 
out with, lay them on the spinach, and serve them up 
with melted butter in a cup. Garnish with orange 
cut into quarters. 

To make Ramekins. 

Put a bit of Parmasan cheese into a stew-pan, 
bruising it with a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a 
giU of water, very Uttle salt, and an anchovy cut small ; 
boil the whole well together, and put in as much flour 
as the sauce will suck up ; keep it over the fire till it 
forms a thick paste, then put it into a stew-pan with 
the yolks of a dozen eggs, and beat up the whites 
quite stiff till they will bear an egg, then mix the 
whites with the rest. Drop them into square paper 
cases. If well made, the ramekins will be of a Ught 
and of a fine colour. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

VEGETABLES and ROOTS. 

IN dressing these articles, the greatest attentimi must 
be paid to cleanliness. They are, particularly at some 



times of the year, subject to dust, dirt, and insects, m 
tlmt if they are not properly cleansed, they will be 
luisatisfactory to those for whom they are provided, 
and disreputable to the cook. To avoid this, be care* 
fol first to pick off all the outside leaves, then wash them 
well in several waters, and let them lie some time in a 
pan of clean water before you dress them. Be sure 
your saucepan ia thoroughly clean, and boil them by 
themselves in plenty of water. They should always 
be brought crisp to table, which will be effected by be- 
ing careful not to boil them too much. Such are the 
general observations necessary to be attended to in 
dressing <^ Vegetabies and Roots. We shall now 
proceed to particulars, beginning with 

Jlsparagus. 
Scrape all the stalks very carefully till they look 
white, then cut them all even alike, and throw them 
into a pan of clean water, and have ready a stew-pan 
with water boiling. Put some salt in, and when tiiey 
are a little tender take them up. If you boil them too 
much, they will lose both their colour and taste. Cut 
the round off a small loaf, about half an inch thick, and 
toast it brown on both sides : then dip it into the 
liquor the asparagus was boiled in, and lay it in your 
dish. Pour a little melted butter over your toast, then 
lay your asparagus on the toast all round your dish, 
with the heads inwards, and send it to table, with 
melted butter in a basin. Some pour melted butter 
over them, but this is injudicious, as it makes the hand- 
ling them very disagreeable. 

Artichokes. 
Twist off the stalks, then put them into cold 
water, and wash them well. When the water boil^ 
put them in with the tops downwards, that all the dust 
and sand may boil out. About an hour and a half, 
or two 'hours, will do them. Serve them up with 
melted butter in cups. 

Broccoli. 
Carefullt strip off all the little branches till yoo 



168 VBQSTABLSS. 

oome to the tap one, and then with a knife peel off 
the hard outside skin that is on the stalks and litfle 
branches, and throw them into water. Have ready a 
stew-pan of water, throw in a little salt, and when it 
boils, put in your broccoli. When the stalks are 
tender, it is enough. Put in a piece of toasted bread, 
soaked in the water the broccoli was boiled in at the 
bottom of your dish, and put your broccoli on the top 
of it, as you do asparagus. Send them up to table 
laid in bunches, with butter in a boat. 

Cauliflowers. 

Take off the green part, then cut the flower into 
feur parts, and lay them in water for an hour. Then 
have some milk and water boiling, put in the cauli- 
floweirs, and be sure to skim the saucepan well. When 
the stalks feel tender, take up the flowers carefully, 
and put them in a cullender to drain. Then put a 
spoonful of water into a clean stew-pan, with a Utile 
dust of flour, about a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
little pepper and salt, and shake it round till the but- 
ter is melted, and the whole well mixed together. 
Then take half the cauliflower, ai;id cut it as you would 
for pickling. Lay it into the stew-pan, turn it, and 
shake the pan round for about ten minutes, which will 
be sufficient time to do it properly. Lay the stewed 
in the middle of your plate, the boiled round it, and 
pour over it the butter in which the one-half was 
stewed. This is a delicate mode of dressing cauli- 
flowers ; but the usual way is as follows : cut the 
stalks off, leave a little green on, and boil them in 
spring water and salt for about fifteen minutes. Then 
take them out, drain them, and send them whole to 
table, with melted butter in a sauce-boat. 

Green Peas. 

Let your peas be shelled as short a time asyou can 
before they pre dressed, as otherwise they will lose a 
great part of their sweetness. Put them into boiling 
water, with a little salt and a lump of loaf sugar, and 



VEOfiTABLfiS. 169 

when they begin to dent in the middle, iiiey are enough. 
Put them into a sieve, drain the water clear from them, 
and pour them into jour dish. Put in them a good 
lamp of butter, and stir them about with a spoon till 
it is thoroughly melted. Mix with them likewise a 
Uttle pepper and salt. Boil a small bunch of mint by 
itself, chop it fine, and lay it in lumps round the edge 
of your dish. Melted butter is sometimes preferred 
to mixing it with the peas. 

Windsor Beans. 

These must be boiled in plenty of water, with a 
good quantity of salt in it, and when they feel tender, 
are enough. Boil and chop some parsley, put it into 
good melted butter, and serve them up with boiled 
bacon, and the butter and parsley, in a boat. Remem- 
ber never to boil them with bacon, as that will greatly 
disccAour them. 

Kidney Beans. 

First carefully string them, then slit them down 
the middle, and cut them across. Put them into salt 
and water, and when the water boils in your sauce- 
pan, put them in with a little salt. They will be soon 
done, which may be known by their feeling tender. 
Drain the water clear from them, lay them in a plate, 
and send them up with butter in a sauce-boat. 

Spinach. 

Be careful to pick it exceeding clean, then wash it 

in five or six waters, put it into a saucepan that ivill 

just hold it, without water, throw a little salt over it, 

and cover it close. Put your saucepan on a clear 

2uick fire, and when you find the spinach shrunk and 
dlen to the bottom, and the liquor that comes out 
boils up, it is done. Then put it into a clean sieve to 
drain, and just give it a gentle squeeze. Lay it on 
a plate, and send it to table, with melted butter in a 
boat. » 

Cabbages. 
After you have taken off the outer leaves, and 
well washed them, quarter them, and boil them in 

No. 8. Y 



176 ROOTS* 

plenty of water» with a handful of salt. When they 
are tender, drain them on a sieve, but do not press 
them. Savoys and greens must be boiled in tbe same 
manner, but always by themselves, by which means 
they will eat crisp, and be of a good colour. 

Turnips. 

These may be boiled in the same pot with your 
meat, and, indeed, will eat best if so done. When 
they are enough, take them out, put them into a pan, 
mash them with butter, and a little salt, and in that 
state send them to table. 

Another method of boiling turnips is thus : When 
you have pared them, cut them into little square 
pieces, then put them into a saucepan, and just cover 
them with water. As soon as they are enough, take 
them off the fire, and put them into a sieve to drain. 
Then put them into a saucepan, with a good piece of 
butter, stir them over the fire a few minutes, put them 
into your dkh. and serve them up. 

Carrots. 
Scrape your carrots very clean, put them into the 
pot, and when they are enough, take them out and 
rub them in a clean cloth. Then slice them into a 
plate, and pour some melted butter over them. If 
they are young, half an hour will sufficiently boil them. 

Parsnips. 

These must be boiled in plenty of water, and when 
they are soft, which you may know by running a fork 
into them, take them up. Scrape them all fine vrith 
a knife, throw away all the sticky part, and send them 
to table, with melted butter in a sauce-boat. 

Potatoes. 
These must be boiled in so small a quantity of 
water as will be just sufficient to keep the saucepan 
firom burning. Keep them close covered, and as soon 
as the skins begin to crack, they are enough. Having 
drained out all the water, let them remain in the sauce- 
pan covered ibr two or three minutes ; then peel them, 



BOILBD PUDDINGS. 171 

lay them in a plate, and ponr some melted butler over 
ihem. Or when yon have peeled them, yon may do 
thos : lay them on the gridiron till they are of a fine 
brown, and then send them to table. 

Potatoes scolloped. 
Having boiled your potatoes, beat them fine in a 
bowl, vdth some cream, a large piece of butter, and a 
little salt. Put them into scollop-shells, make them 
smooth on the top, score them with a knife, and lay 
thin slices of butter on the tops of them. Then put 
them into a Dutch oven to brown before the fire. — 
This makes a pretty dish for a light supper. 

Hops. 
They are to be boiled in water, with a little salt, 
and eat as a salad, with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

PUDDINGS. 

IN this degree of cookery some previous and gene* 
ral observations are necessary, the most material of 
which are, first, that your cloth be thoroughly clean, 
and before you put your pudding into it, dip it into 
boiling water, strew some flour over it, and then give 
it a shake. If it is a bread pudding, tie it loose ; but 
if a batter pudding, close ; and never put your pudding 
in till the water boils. All bread and custard puddings 
that are baked require time and a moderate oven ; but 
batter and rice puddings a quick oven. Before you 
put your pudding into the dish for baking be carefiil 
always to moisten the bottom and sides with butter. 



SECT. I. 

BOILED PUDDINGS. 

Bread Pudding. 
Take the crumb of a penny loaf, cut it into very 



r- -/■

172 BOILBD. 

thin slices, put it into a qnart of milk, and set it overa 
a chafing*dish of coals till the Inread has soaked up aH 
the milk. Then pot in a piece of butter, stir it round, 
and let it stand till it is cold; or you may boil your 
milk, and pour it over the bread, and cover it up close, 
which will equally answer the same purpose. Then 
take the yolks of six eggs, the whites of three, and 
beat them up with a little rose-water and nutmeg, and 
a littie salt and sugar. Mix all well together, and 
put it into your cloth, tie it loose to give it room to 
swell, and boil it an hour. When done, put it into 
your dish, pour melted butter over, and serve it to 
table. 

Another, but more expensive, way of making a 
bread-pudding is this : cut thin all the crumb of a 
stale penny loaf, and put it into a quart of cream, set 
it over a slow fire, till it is scalding hot, and then let it 
stand till it is cold. Beat up the bread and the cream 
well together, and grate in some nutmeg. Take twelve 
bitter almonds, boU them in two spoonsful of water, 
pour the water to the cream, stir it in with a littie salt, 
and sweeten it to your taste. Blanch the almonds in 
a mortar, with two spoonsful of rose or orange-flower 
water, till they are a fine paste ; then mix them by 
degrees with the cream. Take the yolks of eight eggs, 
and the whites of four, beat them up well, put them 
into the cream likewise, and mix the whole well to- 
gether. Dip your cloth into warm water, and flour it 
well, before you put in the pudding ; tie it loose, and 
let it boil an hour. Take care the water boils when 
you put it in, and that it keeps so all the time. When 
it is enough, turn it into your dish. Melt some but- 
ter, and put in it two or three spoonsful of white wine 
or sack ; give it a boil, and pour it over your pudding. 
Then strew a good deal of fine sugar over your pud- 
ding and dish, and send it hot to table. Instead of a 
cloth, you may boil it in a bowl or basin, which is in- 
deed the better way of the two. In this case, when 
it is enough, take it up in the basin, and let it stand 
a minute or two to cool ; then untie the string, wrap 



PUDDINGS. 173 

the cloth round the basin, lay your dish over it, and 
turn the padding out ; then take off the basin and doth 
with great care, otherwise a light pudding will be sub* 
ject to break in turning out. 

Batter Pudding. 

Take a quart of milk, beat up the yolks of six eggs, 
and the whites of three, and mix them with a quarter 
of a pint of milk. Then take six spoonsful of flour, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, and one of ginger. Put to these 
the remainder of the milk, mix all well together, put 
it into your cloth, and boil it an hour and a quarter. 
Pour melted butter over it when you serve it up. 

A batter pudding may be made without eggs, in 
which case proceed thus : take a quart of milk, mix 
six spoonsful of flour with a little of the milk first, a 
tea-spoonful of salt, two of beaten ginger, and two of 
the tincture of safirou. Then mix aU together, and 
boil it an hour. 

Custard Pudding. 

Put a piece of cinnamon into a pint of thick cream, 
boil it, and add a quarter of a pound of sugar. When 
cold, put in the yolks of five eggs well beaten : stu* 
this over the fire tiU it is pretty thick, but be careful 
it does not boil. When quite cold, butter a cloth well, 
dust it with flour, tie the custard in it very close, and 
boil it three quarters of an hour. When you take it 
up put it into a basin to cool a little ; untie the doth, 
lay the dish on the basin, and turn it carefiilly out. 
Grate over it a little sugar, and serve it up with melted 
butter and a little wine in a boat. 

Quaking Pudding. 

Take a quart of cream, boil it, and let it stand till 
almost cold ; then beat up tour e^s very fine, with a 
spoonful and a half of flour : mix them well with your 
cream : add sugar and nutmeg to your palate. Tie 
it close up in a doth well buttered. Let it boil an 
hour, and then turn it carefully out. Pour o^'er it 
melted butter.

three spoonsful of crumbs of bread. Mix all well to- 
gether, and boil it. Half an hour will do it 

Tansey Pudding. 

Put as much boiling cream to four Naples biscuits 

gated as will wet them, beat them with the yolks of 
ur eggs. Have ready a few chopped tansey-leaves, 
with as much spinach as will make it pretty green. 
Be carefiil not to put too much tansey in, because it 
will make it bitter. Mix all together when the cream

CHAPTER XV. 

PIES. 

THERE are several things necessaiy to be parti- 
cularly observed by the cook, in order that her labours 
and ingenuity under this head may be brought to their 
proper d^ee of perfection. One very material consi- 
deration must be, that the heat of the oven is duly 
Sroportioned to the nature of the article to be baked. 
J ight paste requires a moderate oven ; if it is too quick, 
the crust cannot rise, and will therefore be burned ; and 
if too slow, it will be soddened, and want that deli- 
cate light brown it ought to have. Raised pies must 
have a quick oven, and be well closed up, or they will 
sink in their sides, and lose their proper shape. Tarts 
that are iced, should be baked in a slow oven, or the 
icing will become brown before the paste is properly 
baked. 

Having made these general obser\'ations respecting 
the baking of pies, we shall now direct the cook how 
to make the different kinds of paste, as they must be 
proportioned in the quaUties according to the respec- 
tive articles for which they are to be used. 

Puff Paste must be made thus : Take a quarter of 
a peck of flour, and rub it into a pound of butter very 
fine. Make it up into a light paste, with cold water, 
just stiff enough to work it up. Then roll it out about 
as thick as a crown piece ; put a layer of butter all 
over, then sprinkle on a little flour, double it up, and 
roll it out again. Double and roll it, with layers of 
butter three times, and it will be properly fit for use. 

' Short Crust. Put six ounces of butter to eight of 
flour, and work them well together ; ' then mix it up 
with as little water as possible, so as to have it a stir- 
iish paste ; then roll it out thin for use. 



190 USAT PIES. 

A good Paste far large Pies. Take a peck of flov, 
and pat to it three eggs ; then put in half a pound of 
8uety and a pound and a half of butter and suet, and 
as much of the liquor as will make it a good light crust. 
Work it up well, and roll it out. 

A standing Crust for great Pies. Take a peek 
of flour and six pounds of butter boiled in a gallon of 
water : skim it off into the flour, and as little of the 
liquor as you can. Work it up well into a paste, and 
then puli it into pieces till it is cold. Then make it 
up into what form you please. 

Paste for Tarts. Put an ounce of loaf sugar beat 
and sifled to one pound of fine flour. Make it into a 
stiff* paste, with a gill of boiling cream, and three 
ounces of butter. Work it well, and roll it very thin. 

Paste for Custards. To half a pound of flour put 
six ounces of butter, the yolks of two eggs, and three 
spoonsful of cream. Mix them together, and let 
them stand a quarter of an hour ; then work it up 
and down, and roU it out very thin.

ing-pin, then season them with pepper and salt to your 
palate. Make a good crust, lay in your steaks, and 
then pour in as much water as will nil the dish. Put 
on the crust, send it to the oven and let it be well 
baked. 

Mutton Pie. 

Take off* the skin and outside fat of a loin of mut* 
ton, cut it into steaks, and season them well with

the bone that marks the chop ; cover yonr dish with 
paste, and put the chops on it : season them with 
salt and mixed spices : put truffles between them. — 
Cover them with slices of bacon, and spread over the 
whole butter the thickness of half a crown. Complete 
your pies with a short crust, and when baked add a 
good cuUis mixed with a glass of white wine. It will 
take two hours to bake in a moderate oven. 

A Veal Pie, made of the brisket part of the breast, 
may be done in the same manner, letting the veal first 
be stewed. 

Vecd Pie. 

Cut a breast of veal into pieces, season them with 
pepper and salt, and lay them in your dish. Boil six 
or eight eggs hard, take the yolks only, and put them 
into aifferent places in the pie, then pour in as much 
water as will nearly fill the dish, put on the lid and 
bake it well. A lamb pie must be done in the same 
manner. 

Ji rich Veal Pie. 

Cut a loin of veal into steaks, and season them 
with salt, pepper, nutmeg, and beaten mace. Lay 
the meat in vour dish, with sweetbreads seasoned, and 
the yolks of six hard eggs, a pint of oysters, and half 
a pint of good gravy. Lay a good puff-paste round 
your dish, half an inch thick, and cover it with a lid 
of the same substance. Bake it an hour and a quar- 
ter in a quick oven. When it comes home, take off 
the lid, cut it into eight or ten pieces, and stick them 
round the inside of the riip of the dish. Cover the 
meat with slices of lemon, and send the pie hot to 
table. 

Lamb or Veal Pies in high Taste. 

Cut your lamb or veal into small pieces, and sea- 
son with pepper, salt, cloves, mace, and nutmegs beat 



192 MBAT PIES. 

fine* Make a good poff-paste crast, lay it in yotir dish, 
then pat in your meat, and strew on it some stoned 
raisins and currants clean washed, and some sugar. — 
Then lay on some forcemeat-balis made sweet, and, 
if in the summer, some artichoke bottoms boiled ; but ijf 
in winter, scalded grapes. Add to these some Spa- 
nish potatoes boiled, and cut into pieces, some candied 
citron, candied orange, lemon-peel, and three (h: four 
blades of mace. Put butter on the top, close np your 

{)ie, and bake it. Have ready against it is done the 
bllowing composition : Mix the yolks of three ^gs 
with a pint of wine, and stir them weU together over 
the fire one way, till it is thick. Then take it off, put 
in sugar enough to sweeten it, and squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon. Raise the lid of your pie, put this 
hot into it, close it up again, and send it to table. 

Venison Pasty. 

Take a neck and breast of venison, bone them, 
and season them well with pepper and salt, put them 
into a deep pan, with the best part of a neck of mut- 
ton sliced and laid over them ; pour in a glass of red 
wine, put a coarse paste over it, and bake it two 
hours in an oven ; then lay the venison in a dish, pour 
the gravy over it, and put one pound of butter over it ; 
make a good puff-paste, and lay it near half an inch 
thick round the edge of the dish ; roll out the lid, 
which must be a little thicker than the paste on the 
edge of the dish, and lay it on ; then roll out another 
lid pretty thin, and cut in flowers, leaves, or whatever 
form ycnx please, and lay it on the lid. If you do not 
want it, it will keep in the pot that it was baked in 
eight or ten days; but let the crust be kept on, that the 
air may not get to it. A breast and shoulder of veni- 
son is the most proper for pasty. 

Olive Pie.

take a part and roll it to the sides of your stew-pan» 
put it in the bottom and round the sides, that it may 
take the form of the stew-pan ; then put in any meat 
or fish you may think fit. You must butter your stew- 
pan well, to make it turn out. Cover it with what 
paste remains, and send it to tibe oven ; or bury the 
stew-pan in hot. embers, and cover it with a lid that 
will admit fire on the top. When turned out of the

spoonsful of vinegar, and a little anchovy liquor. Melt 
half a pound of iresh butter, and stir all together, with 
the crumbs of a penny roll rubbed through a fine cul- 
lender, and the yoll^ of ten eggs. Put a fine poff- 
paste over your dish, lay in the tails first, and the rest 
of the meat on them. Put on the lid, and bake it in 
a slow oven. '

CHAPTER XVL 

• PAJ^CAKES JiJW FRITTERS. 

THE principal things to be observed, of a general 
nature, in dressing these articles is, that your pan be 
thoroughly clean, that you fry them in nice sweet lard, 
or firesh butter, of a light brown colour, and that the 
grease is thoroughly drained from them before you 
carry them to table. 

Pancakes. 

BfiAt six or eight eggs well together, leaving out 
half the whites, and stir them into a quart of milk. Mix 
your flour first with a little of the milk, and then add 
the rest by degrees. Put in two spoonsfrd of beaten gin- 
ger, a glass of brandy, and a little salt, and stir all well 
together. Put a piece of butter into your stew-pan, 
and then pour in a ladleful of batter, which will make 
a pancake, moving the pan roimd, that the batter may 
spread all over it. — Shsdte the pan, and when you think 
one side is enough, turn it, and when both sides are 
done, lay it in a dish before the fire ; and in like man- 
ner do the rest. Before you take them out of the pan, 
raise it a little, that they may drain, and be quite clear 
of grease. When you send them to table, strew a lit- 
tle sugar over them. 

Cream Pancakes. 

Mix the yolks of two e^ with half a pmt of cream, 
two ounces of sugar, and a little beaten cinnamon, 
mace, and nutmeg. Rub your pan with lard, and fiy 
them as thin as possible. Grate over them some fine 
sugar. 

Rice Pancakes. 

Take tliree spoonsful of flour and rice, and a quart 
of cream. Set it on a slow fire, and keep stirring it 
tm it is as thick as pap. r onr into it half a pound of 
butter, and a nutmeg grated . Tlien pour it into an earth- 
en pan, and when it is cold, stir in three or four spoons* 



20B FRITTERS. 

■ 

fol of flour^ a little salt, and some sogar^ and nine eggs 
well beaten. Mix all well together, andi fry them 
nicely. When cream is not to be had, you must use 
new milk, but in that case you must add a spoonful 
more of the flour of rice. 

Pink-coloured Pancakes. 

Boil a large beet-root till it is tender, and then 
beat it fine in a marble mortar. Add the yolks of four 
eggs, two spoonsful of flour, and three spoonsful of cream. 
Sweeten it to your taste, grate in half a nutmeg, and 
add a glass of brandy. Mix all wdl together, and fry 
your pancakes in butter. Garnish them with green 
sweetmeats, preserved apricots, or green sprigs of m]^- 
tie. This makes a pretty comer-dish either for dinn» 
or supper. 

Clary Pancakes. 

Take three eggs, three spoonsful of fine flour, and 
a litte salt. Beat them well together, and mix them 
with a pint of milk. Put lard into your pan, and when 
it is hot, pour in your batter as thin as possible, then 
lay in some clary leaves washed and dried, and pour a 
little more batter thin over them. Fry them of^a nice 
l)rown, and serve them up hot. 

Plain Fritters. 

Grate the cramb of a penny loaf, and put it into 
a pint of milk ; mix it very smooth, and when cold, 
add the yolks of five eggs, three ounces of sifled sugar, 
and some grated nutmeg. Fry them in hog^s. lard,and 
when done, pour melted butter, wine and sugar into 
the dish. 

Custard Fritters. 

Brat up the yolks of eight eggs with one spoonful 
of flour, hau a nutmeg, a little salt, and a glass of bran- 
dy, add a pint of cream, sweeten it, and bake it in 
a small dish. When cold, cut it into quarters, and dip 
them in batter made of half a pint of cream, a quarter 
of a pint of milk, fi>ur eggs, a little flour, and a little

gingergrated. Fry them in good lard or dripping, and 
when done strew over them some grated sugar. 

Apple Fritters. 

Take some of the largest apples you can get, pare 
and core them, and then cut them into round slices. 
Take half a pint of ale and two eggs, and beat in as 
much flour as will make it rather thicker than a com- 
mon pudding, with nutmeg and sugar to your taste. 
Let it stand three or four minutes to rise. Dip your 
slices of apple into the batter, fry them crisp, and serve 
them up with sugar grated over them, and wine sauce 
in a boat. 

Water Fritters. 

Take five or six spoonsful of flour, a little salt» 
a quart of water, eight eggs well beat up, a glass of 
brandy, and mix them all well together. The longer 
they are made before di'essed, the better. Just before 
you do them, melt half a pound of butter, and beat it 
well in. Fry them in hog's lard. 

White Fritters. 

Take two ounces of rice, wash it clean in water, 
and dry it before the fire. Then beat it very fine in a 
mortar, and sift it throngh a lawn sieve. Pat it into a 
saucepan, just wet it with milk, and when it is tho- 
roughly moistened, add to it another pint of milk. Set 
the whole over a stove, or very slow fire, and take 
care to keep it always moving. Put in a little ginger, 
and some candied lemon-peel grated. Keep it over 
the fire, till it is come almost to the thickness of a fine 
paste. When it is quite cold, spread it out with a 
rolling-pin, and cut it into little pieces, taking care 
they do not stick to each other. Flour yonr hands, 
roll up your fritters handsomely, and fiy them. When 
done, strcAV on them some sugar, and pour over them 
a little orange-flower water. 

Hasty Fritters. 

Put some butter into a stew-pan, and let it 
heat. Take half a pint of good ale, and stir into it by 
No. 9. 2D 



210 FRItTSBS. 

degrees a little flour. Put in a few GxnrrantSy or chop* 
ped apples, beat them up quick, and drop a large 
spoonml at a time all over the pan. Take care they 
do not stick together ; turn them with an egg-slice, 
and when they Ire of a fine brown, lay them on! dish. 
strew some sugar over them, and serve them hot to 
table. 

Fritters Royal. 

Put a quart of new milk into a saucepan, and when 
it begins to boil, pour in a pint of sack, or wine. Then 
take it off, let it stand five or six minutes, skim off the 
cm'd, and put it into a basin. Beat it up well with 
six esgs, and season it with nutmeg. Then beat it 
withTv^hisk, and add flour sufficient to give it the 
usual thickness of batter ; put in some sugar, and firy 
them quick. 

Tansey Fritters. 

Pour a pint of boiling milk on the crumb of a 
penny loaf, let it stand an hour, and then put in as 
much juice of tansey to it as will give it a flavour. 
Add to it a Uttle of the juice of spinach, in order to 
make it green. Put to it a spoonful of ratafia water, 
or brandy, sweeten it to your taste, grate the rind of 
half a lemon, beat the yolks of four eggs, and mix them 
all together. Put them in a stew-pan, vdth a quarter 
of a pound of butter, stir it over a slow fire till it is 
quite thick ; take it off, and let it stand two or three 
hours ; then drop a spoonful at a time into a pan of 
boiling lard ; and when done, grate sugar over them, 
and serve wine sauce in a boat. Garnish the dish 
with slices of orange. 

Rice Fritters. 
Boil a quarter of a pound of rice in milk till it is 
pretty thick; then mix it with a pint of cream, four 
eggs, some sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg, six ounces 
of currants washed and picked, a little salt, and as much 
flour as will make it a thick batter. Fry them in Ut- 
ile cakes in boiling lard, and when done, send them up 
with white sugar and butter. 



FBITTBR8. 211 

Chicken Fritters. "' 

Put on a stew-pan with some new milk, and as 
mnch flour of rice as will be necessary to make it of a 
tolerable thickness. Beat three or four eggs, the yolks 
and whites together, and mix them well with the rice 
and milk. Add to them a pint of rich cream, set it 
over a stove, and stir it well. Put in some powdered 
sugar, some candied lemon-peel cut small, and some 
firesh-grated lemon-peel. Take all the white meat 
firom a roasted chicken, pull it into small shreds, put 
it to the rest of the ingredients, and stir it all together. 
Then take it off, and it will be a very rich paste. Roll 
it out, cut it into small fritters, and fry them in boiling 
lard. Strew the bottom of the dish with sugar finely 
powdered. Put in the fritters, and shake some sugar 
over them. 

Bilhoquet Fritters. 
Break five eggs into two handsful of fine flour, and 
put milk enough to make it work well together. Then 
put in some salt, and work it again. When it is 
well made, put in a tea-spoonful of powder of cinna- 
mon, the same quantity of lemon-peel grated, and 
half an ounce of candied citron cut very small. Put 
on a stew-pan, rub it over with butter, and put in the 
paste. Set it over a very slow fire, and let it be done 
gently, without sticking to the bottom or sides of the 
pan. When it is in a manner baked, take it out, and 
lay it on a dish. Set on a stew-pan with a large quan- 
tity of lard ; when it boils, cut the paste the size of a 
finger, and then cut it across at each end, which will 
rise and be hollow, and have a very good eflect. Put 
them into the boiling lard ; but great care must be 
taken in frying them, as they rise so much. When 
they are done, sift some sugar on a warm dish, lay on 
the fiitters, and sift some more sugar over them. 

Orange Fritters. 

Take five or six sweet oranges, pare off" the outside / 

as thin as possible, and cut them in quarters ; take 
out the seeds, and boil the oranges with a little sugar ; '

212 

make a paste with s^me white wine, floor, a spoonfol 
of fresh butter melted^ and a little salt; mix it neither 
too thick nor too thin ; it shoold rope in pooring from 
the spoon. Dip the quarters of your orange into this 
paste, and fry them in hog^s lard till they are of a light 
brown. Serve them glazed with fine sugar and a sala- 
mander. 

Strawberry Fritters. 

Make a paste with some flour, a spoonful of bran- 
dy, a glass of white wine, and the whites of two eggs, 
beat it up stiff, with some lemon-peel shred fine ; mix 
it well, not too thick or thin ; dip some large straw- 
berries into it, fry them, and glaze them with a 
salamander. 

Any kind of fruit may be firied in the same manner ; 
if not in season, preserved are better. 

Strawberry Fritters. 

Make a batter with flour, a spoonful of sweet oil, 
another of white wine, a little rasped lemon-peel, and 
the whites of two or three eggs ; make it pretty sofl, 
just fit to drop with a spoon. Mix some large straw- 
berries with it, and drop them with a spoon into the 
hot firitters. When of a good colour take them out, 
and drain them on a sieve. When done, strew some 
sugar over them, or glaze them, and send them to 
table. 

Raspberry Fritters. 

Grate the crumb of a French roll, or two Naples 
biscuits, and put to it a pint of boiling cream. When 
cold, add to it the yolks of fom* eggs well beat up. — 
Mix all well together with some raspberry juice; 
drop them into a pan of boiling lard in very small 
quantities. When done stick them with blanched al- 
monds sliced. 

Currant Fritters. 

Take half a pint of ale that is not bitter, and stir 
into it as much flour as will make it pretty thick with i 
a few currants. Beat it up quick, have the lard boil- 
ing, and put a large spoonful at a time into the pan. 



TARTS« 213 

Chrman Fritters. 

Take some well tasted crisp apples, pare, quarter, 
and core them ; take the core quite out, and cut them 
into round pieces. Put into a stew-pan a quarter of 
a pint of French brandy, a table spoonful of fine sugar 
pounded, and a little cinnamon. Put the apples into 
this liquor, and set them over a gentle fire, stirring 
them often, but not to break them. Set on a stew- 
pan with some lard. When it boils drain the apples, 
dip them in some fine flour, and put them into the pan. 
Strew some sugar over the dish, and set it on the fire ; 
lay in the firitters, strew a little sugar over them, and 
glaze them over with a red-hot salamander. 

Almond Fraze. 

Stbep a pound of Jordan almonds blanched in a. 
pint of cream, ten yolks of e^, and four whites. Then 
take out the almonds, and pound them fine in a mor- 
tar ; mix them again in the cream and eggs, and put 
in some sugar and grated white bread. Stir them all 
together, put some fi*esh butter into the pan, and as 
soon as it is hot, pour in the batter, stirring it in the 
pan till it is of a good thickness. When enough, turn it 
into a dish, and throw some sugar over it. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

TARTS AJW PUFFS. 

WE have already given directions for making puff- 
paste for tarts, as also the making of Tarts as well 
as Pies, in the commencement of the fifteenth chap- 
ter. We have, therefore; here to treat only of those 
of a smaller and more delicate kind, concerning which 
the following general observations are necessary. 

If you use tin patties to bake it, butter the bottoms, * 
and then put on a very thin bit of crust, otherwise you 
will not be able to take them out ; but if you bake 
them in glass or china, you need only use an upper 



214 TARTS. 

crost. Put some fine sugar at the bottom, then lay 
in your fruit, strew more sugar at top, cover them, 
and bake them in a slack oven. Currants and rasp- 
berries make an exceeding good tart, and require 
little baking. 

Apples and pears intended for tarts must be ma- 
naged thus : cut them into quarters, and take out the 
cores, then cut the quarters across, and put them into 
a saucepan, with as much water as will barely cover 
them, and let them simmer on a slow fire till the firuit 
is tender. Put a good piece of lemon-peel into the 
water with the firuit, and then have your patties ready. 
Lay &e sugar at bottom, then ,o^ 6»S. and a MtL 
sugar at top. Pour over each tart one tea-spoonnd 
of lemon-juice, and three of the liquor they were boil- 
ed in ; then put on your lid, and bake them in a slack 
oven. Apricot tarts may be made in the same man- 
ner, only that you must not put in any lemon-juice. 

Preserved mnt requires very little baking, and that 
which is very high preserved should not be baked at 
all. In this case, the crust should be first baked upon 
a tin the size of the intended tart ; cut it with a mark- 
ing iron, and when cold, take it off*, and lay it on the 
firuit. 



SECT. I. 

DIFFERENT KINDS OF TARTS. 

Raspberry Tart. 

Roll out some thin puff-paste, and lay it in a patty- 
pan; then put in some raspberries, and strew over 
them some very fine sugar. Put on the lid, and bake 
it. Then cut it open, and put in half a pint of cream, 
the yolks of two or three eggs well beaten, and a little 
sugar. Give it another heat in the oven, and it will 
be fit for use. 

Green Almond Tarts. 

Gather some almonds off the tree before they 



TABTB. 215 

begin to sheU, scrape off the down, and put them into 
a pan with some cold spring water. Then pnt them 
into a skillet with more spring water, set it on a slow 
fire, and let it remain till it just sinmiers. Change the 
water twice, and let them remain in the last till they 
begin to be tender. Then take them out, and dry 
them well in a cloth. Make a syrup with double re* 
fined sugar, put them into it, and let them simmer a 
short time. Do the same the next day, put them 
into a stolie jar, and cover them very close, for if the 
least air comes to them, they will turn black. The 
yellower they are before they are taken out of the wa- 
ter, the greener they will be after they are done. Put 
them into your crust, cover them with syrup, lay on 
the lid, and bake them in a moderate oven. 

Angelica Tarts. 

Pare and core some golden pippins, or nonpareils ; 
then the stalks of angelica, peel them, and cut them 
into small pieces; apples and angelica, of each an 
equal quantity. Boil the apples in just water enough 
to cover them, with lemon-peel, and fine sugar. Do 
them very gently till they become a thin syrup, and 
then strain it off. Put it on the fire with the angelica 
in it, and let it boQ ten minutes. Make a puff-paste, 
lay it at the bottom of the tin, and then a layer of 
apples, and a layer of angelica, till it is full. Pour in 
some syrup, put on the lid, and send it to a very mo- 
derate oven. 

Rhubarb Tarts. 

Take the stalks of rhubarb that grow in a garden, 
peel them, and cut them into small pieces. Then do 
it in every respect the same as a gooseberry tart. 

Spinach Tarts. 

Scald some spinach in boiling water, and then 
drain it quite dry. Chop it, and stew it in some but- 
ter and cream, with a very little salt, some sugar, some 
bits of citron, and very little orange-flower water. 



216 TARTS. 

Put it into very fine pnff-pa^e, and let it be baked in 
a moderate oven. 

Petit Patties. 

Make a short crust, and roll it thick; take a piece 
of veal, and an equal quantity of bacon and beef suet. 
Shred them all very fine, season them with pepper and 
salt, and a httle sweet herbs. Put them into a stew- 
pan, and keep turning them about, with a few mush- 
rooms chopped small, for eight or ten minutes. Then 
fiU your patties, and cover them with crust'. Colour 
them with the yolk of an egg, and bake them. These 
make a very pretty garnish, and give a handsome ap- 
pearance to a large dish. 

Orange Tarts. 

Grate a little of the outside rind of a Seville 
orange ; squeeze the juice of it into a dish, throw the 
peels into water, and change it often for four days. — 
Then set a saucepan of water on the fire, and when it 
boils put in the oranges ; but mind to change the water 
twice to take out the bitterness. When they are ten- 
der, wipe them well, and beat them in a mortar till 
they are fine. Then take their weight in double- 
refined sugar, boil it into a syrup, and scum it very 
clean. Put in the pulp, and boil altogether till it is 
clear. Let it stand till cold, then put it into the tarts, 
and squee^se in the juice. Bake them in a quick oven. 

* 

Chocolate Tarts. 

Rasp a quarter of a pound of chocolate, and a stick 
of cinnamon, and add to them some fi-esh lemon-peel 
grated, a little salt, and some sugar. Then take two 
spoonsfiil of fine flour, and the yolks of six eggs well 
beaten and mixed with some milk. Put all these in- 
to a stew-pan, and let them be a little time over the 
fire. Then take it off, put in a little lemon-peel cut 
small, and let it stand till it is cold. Beat up enough 
of the whites of eggs to cover it, and put it into ptft- 
paste. When it is baked, sift some sugar over it, and 
glaze it with a salamander*

PUFFS, &c. 

Sugar Puffs. 

Beat up the whites of ten eggs till they rise to a 
high firoth, and then put them into a marble mortar, 
with as much double-refined sugar as will make it 
thick. Then rub it well round the mortar, put in a 
few carraway seeds, and take a sheet of wafers, and 
lay it on as broad as a sixpence, and as high as you 
can. Put them into a moderately heated oven for 
about a quarter of an hour, and they will have a very 
white and delicate appearance. 

Lemon Puffs. 

Take a pound of double-refined sugar, bruise it, 
and sift it through a fine sieve. Put it into a bowl, 
with the juice of two lemons, and mix them together. 
Then beat the white of an egg to a very high firoth, 
put it into your bowl, beat it half an hour, and then 
put in three eggs, with two rinds of lemons grated. 
Mix it well up, and throw sugar on your papers, drop 
on the puffs in small drops, and bake them in a mo- 
derately heated oven. 

Mmond Puffs. 

Take two ounces of sweet almonds, blanch them, 
and beat them very fine with orange-flower water. 
Beat up the whites of three eggs to a very high firoth, 
and then strew in a little sifled sugar. Mix your al- 
monds with the sugar and eggs, and then add more 
sugar till it is as thick as paste. Lay it in cakes, 
and bake them in a slack oven on paper. 

Clwcolate Puffs. 

Beat and sifl half a pound of double-refined sugar, 
scrape into it an ounce of chocolate very fine, and mix 
them together. Beat up the white of an egg to a 
very high firoth, and strew into it your sugar and cho- 
colate. Keep beating it till it is as thick as paste, ttieit

218 CHEESECAKES. 

sngar your paper, drop them on about tne size of a 
sixpence, and hske them in a very slow oven. 

Curd Puffs. 

Put a little rennet into two quarts of milk, and 
when it is broken, put it into a coarse cloth to drain. 
Then rub the curd through a hair sieve, and put to it 
four ounces of butter, ten ounces of bread, half a nut- 
meg, a lemon-peel grated, and a spoonful of wine. — 
Sweeten with sugar to your taste, rub your cups with 
butter, and put them into the oven for about half an 
hour. 

Wafers. 

Take a spoonful of orange-flower water, two 
spoonsful of flour, two of sugar, and the same of milk. 
Beat them well together for half an hour ; then make 
your wafer tongs hot, and pour a Uttle of your batter in 
to cover your irons. Bake them on a stove fire, and as 
they are baking, roll them round a stick like a spigot. 
When they are cold, they wiD be very crisp, and are 
proper to be ate either with jellies or tea.

^ECT. I. 

CHEESECAKES. 

THE shorter time any cheesecakes are made, be- 
fore put into the oven, the better ; but more particu- 
larly almond or lemon cheesecakes, as standing long 
will make them grow oily, and give them a disagree- 
able appearance. Particular attention must likewise 
be paid to the heat of the oven, which must be mo- 
derate ; for if it is too hot, they will be scorched, and 
consequently their beauty spoiled ; and, if too slacks 
they will look black and heavy. 



CHBBSBCAKES. 219 

Common Cheesecakes. 

Put a spoonful of rennet into a quart of new milk, 
and set it near the fire. When the milk js blood- warm, 
and broken, drain the curd through a coarse sieve. 
Now and then break the curd gently with your fingers, 
and rub into it a quarter of a pound of butter, the 
same quantity of sugar, a nutmeg, and two Naples 
biscuits grated ; the yolks of four eggs, and the white 
of one, with an ounce of almonds well beaten with 
f wo spoonsful of rose-water, and the same of sack. 
Then clean and wash six ounces of currants, and put 
them into the curd. Mix all well together, fill your 
patty-pansi and send them to a moderate oven. 

Fine Cheesecakes. 

Put a pint of cream into a saucepan over the fire, 
and when it is warm, add to it five quarts of milk, im- 
mediately taken fi-om the cow. Then put to it some 
rennet, give it a stir about, and when it is turned, 
put the curd into a linen cloth or bag. I let it drain 
well away fi-om the whey, but do not squeeze it too 
much. Put it into a mortar, and pound it as fine as 
butter. Add to it half a pound of .sweet-ahnonds 
blanched, and half a poxmd of macaroons, both beat 
exceeding fine, but if you have no macaroons, Naples 
biscuits wiU do. Then add the yolks of nine ^gs 
well beaten up, a grated nutmeg, a little rose or orange- 
flower water, and half a pound of fine sugar. Mix all 
well together, and melt a pound and a quarter of but* 
ter, and stir it well in. Then make a puff-paste in 
this manner : take a pound of fine flour, wet it with 
cold water, roll it out, put into it by degrees a pound 
of firesh butter, and sh^dce a little flour on each coat as 
you roll it. Then proceed to finish your business as 
before directed, and send them to the oven. For 
variety, when you make them of macaroons, put in as 
much tincture of saffiron as will give them a high co- 
lour, but no currants. These may be called saffiron 
cheesecakes. 



Y 



220 CHEESSCAKSS. 

Bread Cheesecakes. 

Slice a penny loaf as thin as possible, then ponr on 
it a pint of boiling cream, and let it stand two hours. 
Then take eight e^, half a pound of butter, and a 
nutmeg grated. Beat them well together, and mix 
them into the cream and bread, with half a pound of 
currants well washed and dried, and a spoonful of 
white wine or brandy. Bake them in patty-pans, or 
raised crust. 

Rice Cheesecakes, 

Boil four oun(;:es of rice till it is tender, and then 
put it into a sieve to drain. Mix with it four eggs 
well beaten up, half a pound of butter, half a pint of 
cream, six ounces of sugar, a nutmeg grated, and a 
glass of brandy or ratifia water. Beat them all well to- 
gether, then put them into raised crusts, and bake 
them in a moderate oven. 

Mmond Cheesecakes. 

Take four ounces of sweet almonds, blanch them, 
and put them into cold water ; then beat them in a 
marble mortar, or wooden bowl, with some rose-wa- 
ter. Put to it four ounces of sugar, and the yolks of 
four eggs beat fine. Work it in the mortar, or bowl, 
till it becomes white and fi*othy, and then make a rich . 
puff-paste as follows : take half a pound of flour, a 
quarter of a pound of butter, rub a little of the butter 
into the flour, mix it stiff with a little cold water, and 
then roll your paste straight out. Strew on a little 
floury and lay over it, in thin bits, one third of your 
butter ; throw a little more flour over the bottom, and 
do the like three different times. Then put the paste 
into your tins, fill them, grate sugar over them, and 
bake them in a gentle oven. 

Or you may make Jilmand Cheesecakes thus : 

Take four ounces of almonds, blanch them, and. 
beat them with a little orange-flower water ; add the 
yolks of eight egg^^ the rind of a large lemon grated. 



CUSTARDS. 221 

half a pound of melted butter, and sugar to your taste ; 
lay a thin puff-paste at the bottom of your tins^ and 
little slips across. Add about half a dozen bitter 
almonds. 

Lemon Cheesecakes. 

Boil the peelings of two large lemons till they are 
tender ; then pound them well in a mortar, with a quar* 
ter of a pound of loaf sugar, the yolks of six eggs, half 
a pound of fresh butter, and a little curd beat fine. 
Pound and mix aU together, lay a puff-paste in your 
patty-pans, fill them half fiiU, and bake them. 

Orange cheesecakes must be done the same way ; 
but you must boil the peel in two or three waters to 
deprive it of its bitter taste. 

Citron Cheesecakes. 

Beat the yolks of four eggs, and mix them with a 
quart of boiled cream. When it is cold, set it on the 
frre, and let it boil till it curds. Blanch some almonds, 
beat them with orange-flower water, and put them 
into cream with a few Naples biscuits, and green 
citron shred fine. Sweeten it to your taste, and bake 
them in cups. 



SECT. II. 

CUSTARDS. 

In making of custards, the greatest care must be 
taken that your pan be well tinned ; and always re- 
member to put a spoonfiil of water into it, to prevent 
your ingredients sticking to the bottom. 

Plain Custards. 

Put a quart of good cream over a slow fire, with a 
little cinnamon, and fi>ur ounces of sugar. When it has 
boiled, take it off the fire, beat the yolks of eight eggs, 
and put to them a spoonful of orange-flower water, to 
prevent the cream from cracking. Stir them in by de- 
grees as your cream cools, put the pan over a very alow 



222 CUSTARDS. 

fire, stir it carefolly one way till it is almost boiUng, 
and then poar it into cups. 

Or you may make them in this manner : 

Take a quart of new milk, sweeten to your taste, 
beat up well the yolks of eight eggs and the whites of 
fi>ur. Stir them into the milk, and bake it in china 
basins. Or put them into a china dish, and pour 
boiling water round them, till the water is better than 
half way up their sides ; but take care the water does 
not boil too fast, lest it should get into your cups, and 
spoil your custards. 

Baked Custards. 

Boil a pint of cream with some mace and cinna- 
mon, and when it is cold, take four yolks and two 
whites of eggs, a little rose and orange-flower water 
and sack, and nutmeg and sugar to your palate. Mix 
them well together, and bake it in cups. 

Rice Custards. 

Put a blade of mace and a quartered nutmeg into 
a quart of cream ; boil it, then strain it, and add to it 
some whole rice boiled, and a little brandy. Sweeten 
it to your palate, stir it over the iGire till it thickens, 
and serve it up in cups, or a dish. It may be used 
either hot or cold. 

jUmond Custards. 

Take a quarter of a pound of almonds, blanch and 
beat them very fine, and then put them into a pint of 
cream, vdth two spoonsful of rose-water. Sweeten 
it to your palate, beat up the yolks of four eggs very 
fine, and put it in. Stir all together one way over the 
fire till it is thick, and then pour it into cups. 

Lemon Custards. 

Take half a pound of double-refined sugar, the 
juice of two lemons, the rind of one pared very thin, 
the inner rind of one boiled tender, and rubbed through 
a sieve, and a pint of white wine. Let them bml for 
some time, then take out the peel, and a little of tiie 



0AKB8. 223 



fiquor, and tset it to cDoL Pom the rcfst into tlie 
you intend for it, beat lour yolks and two whites of 
eggs, and mix them with your cool liquor. Strain 
them into your dish, stir them well together, and set 
them on a slow fire in boiling water. When it is 
enough, grate the rind of a lemon on the top, and brown 
it over with a hot salamander* This may be eaten 
either hot or cold. 

Orange Custards. 

Boil very tender the rind of half a Seville orange, 
and then beat it in a mortar till it is very fine. Put io 
it a spoonful of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville 
orange, four ounces of loaf sugar, and the yolks of four 
eggs. Beat them all well together for ten minutes, and 
then pour in by degrees a pint of boiling cream. Keep 
beating them till they are cold, then put them in cus- 
tard cups and set them in a dish of hot water. I^et 
them stand till they are set, then take them out, and 
stick preserved orange on the top. These, like the for- 
mer, may be served up either hot or cold. 



CHAPTER XIX. 

CAKES, BISCUITS, ^c. 

ONE very material matter to be attenaea w m 
making these articles is, that all your ingredients are 
ready at the time you are going to make them, and 
that you do not leave them till your business is done; 
but be particularly observant with respect to the 
eggs when beaten up, which, if left at any time, must 
be again beaten, and by that means your cake will not 
be so light as it otherwise would and ought to be. If 
you use butter to your cakes, be careful in beating it 
to a fine cream before you mix the sugar with it. 
Cakes made with rice, seeds, or plums, are best baked 
with wooden girths, as thereby the heat will penetrate 



224 OAKBS. 

into the middle, whidiwill ndt be the case if baked in 
pots or tins. The heat of the oven must be proportion- 
ed to the size of the cake. 

^ A Chad Common Cake. 
Take six ounces of ground rice, and the same quan- 
tity of flour, the yolks and whites of nine ^gs, half a 
pound of lump sugar, pounded and sifted, and half an 
ounce of carraway seeds. Mix these well together, and 
bake it an hour in a quick oven. 

A Rich Seed Cake. 

Take a pound and a quarter of flour well dried, a 
pound of butter, a pound of loaf sugar, beat and sifted, 
eight eggs, two ounces of carraway seeds, one nutmeg 
grated, and its weight in cinnamon. First beat your 
butter to a cream, then put in your sugar ; beat the 
whites of your eggs by themselves, and mix them with 
your butted and l^^and thenbeat up the yolks and 
mix with the whites. Beat in your flour, spices, and 
seed, a little before you send it away. Bake it two 
hours in a quick oven. 

A Pound Cake Plain. 

Beat a pound of butter in an earthen pan, till it is 
like a fine thick cream, then beat in nine whole ^gs 
till quite hght. Put in a glass of brandy, a little lemon- 
peel shred fine ; then work in a pound and a quarter 
of flour. Put it into your hoop or pan, and bake it for 
one hour. 

A pound plum cake is made the same, with putting 
one pound and a half of clean washed currants, and 
half a pound of candied lemon or orange-peel. 

Cream Cakes. 

Beat the whites of nine eggs to a stiff fix>th, stir it 
gently with a spoon, lest the firoth should fall, and to 
every white of an egg grate the rinds of two lemons. 
Shake in gently a spoomul of double-refined sugar sift- 
ed fine, lay a wet sheet of paper on a tin, and with a 
spoon drop the fix)th in little lumps on it, at a small 



CAKES. 225 

distance fiom each other. Sift a good quantity of 
sugar over them, set them in the oven after the bread 
is out, and close up the mouth of it, which will occasion 
the froth to rise. As soon as they are coloured they 
will be sufficiently baked ; then take them out, and 
put two bottoms together ; lay them on a sieve, and 
set them to dry in a cool oven. 

Wedding or Christening Cake. 

Take three pounds and tlu-ee quarters of butter, 
four pounds and a half of flour, three pounds of sugar, 
six pounds of currants, one pound and a half of can- 
died lemon-peel, half a pound of almonds, half a pound 
of citron, thirty eggs, and a pint of brandy and milk. 
Beat your butter in a pan till it is like thick cream, 
but be sure not to make it too hot; then add your 
eggs by degrees, tiU they are quite light; then beat in 
half your flour, then put your milk and brandy in; 
grate the rinds of six lemons, and put in the rest of 
your flour, currants, candied lemon-peel, almonds, and 
half an ounce of spices, beat and sifted through a fine 
sieve, such as cloves, mace, nutmegs, cinnamon, and 
allspice ; only put half an ounce of the whole in. If 
you bake the whole in one cake it will take three 
hours, but must not be baked too quick. 

Rice Cakes. 

Beat the yolks of fifteen eggs for near half an hour 
with a whisk ; then put to them ten ounces of loaf- 
8tigar sifted fijfie, and mix them well together. Then 
put in half a pound of ground rice, a little orange- water 
or brandy, and the rinds of two lemons grated. Then 
put in the whites of seven eggs well beaten, and stir the 
^vhole together for a quarter of an hour. Put them in 
a hoop, and set them in a quick oven for half an hour, 
and they will be properly done. 

Gingerbread Cakes. 

Take three pounds of flour, a pound of sugar, tlie 
same quantity of butter rolled in very fine, two ounces 
Ho. 10. 2F 



226 OAKES. 

of beaten ginger, and a large nutm^ grated. Then 
take a pound of treacle, a quarter of a pint of cream, 
and make them warm together. Work np the bread 
stiff, roll it out, and make it up into thin cakes. Cut 
them out with a tea-cup or small glass, or roll them 
round like nuts, and bake it in a slack oven on tin 
nlates. 

Bath Cakes or Buns. 

Take half a pound of butter, and one pound of 
flour ; rub the batter well into the flour ; add five eggs, 
and a tea-cup full of yeast. Set the whole well mixed 
up before the fire to rise ; when sufficiently rose, add a 
quarter of a pound of fine powder sugar, an ounce of 
carraways well mixed in, then roll them out in little 
cakes, and bake them on tins. They may either be eat 
for breakfast or tea. 

Shrewsbury Cakes. 

Beat half a pound of butter to a fine cream, and 
put in the same weight of flour, one egg, six ounces of 
l)eaten and sifled loaf-sugar, and half an ounce of car* 
raway seeds. Mix them with a paste, roll them thin, 
and cut them round with a small glass, or little tins ; 
prick them, lay them on sheets of tin ; and bake them 
in a slow oven. 

Portugal Cakes. 

Mix into a pound of fine flour a pound of loaf-sugar 
beat and sifted, and rub it into a pound of pure sweet 
butter till it is thick like grated white bread ; then put 
to it two spoonsful of rose-water, two of sack, and ten 
eggs, and then work them well with a whisk, and put 
in eight ounces of currants. Butter the tin pans, fill 
them but half full, and bake them. If made without 
currants, they will keep half a year. 

Saffron Cakes. 

Take a quartern of fine flour, a pound and a half of 
butter, three ounces of carraway seeds, six ^gs well 
beaten, a quarter of an ounce ol cloves and mace fine 



OAKSS* 227 

beaten together, a little cinnamon pounded, a pomid 
of sngar, a little rose-water and saffron, a pint and a 
half of yeast, and a qnart of milk. Mix all together 
lightly in the following manner : first boil yonr milk 
and batter, then skim off the butter, and mix it with 
your flour, and a little of the milk. Stir the yeast into 
the rest, and strain it. Mix it with the flour, put in 
your seeds and spice, rose-water, tincture of safiron, 
sugar, and eggs. Beat it all well up, and bake it in a 
hoop or pan well buttered. Send it to a quick oven, 
and an hour and a half will do it. 

Prussian Cakes. 

Take half a pound of dried flour, a pound of bea- 
ten and sifted sugar, the yolks and whites of seven 
eggs beaten separately, the juice of a lemon, the 
peels of two finely grated, and half a pound of almonds 
beat fine with rose-water. When you have beat the 
whites of the eggs to a froth, put in the yolks, and 
every thing else except the flour, and beat them well 
together. Shake in the flour just before you set it in 
the oven, and be particularly careful to beat the whites 
and yolks separately, otherwise your cake will be hea- 
vy, and very unpleasant. 

Queen Cakes. 

Take a pound of sugar, and beat and sifl it; a 
pound of well dried flour, a pound of butter, eight eggs, 
and half a pound of currants washed and picked ; grate 
a nutmeg, and the same quantity of mace and cinna- 
mon. Work your butter to a cream, and put in your 
sugar ; beat the whites of your eggs near half an hour, 
and mix them with your sugar and butter. Then beat 
your yolks near half an hour, and put them to your 
butter. Beat the whole well together, and when it is 
ready for the oven put in your flour, spices, and cur- 
rants. Sift a little sugar over them, and bake them 
in tins. 

Almond Cakes. 

Take two ounces of butter, and one pound of sweet 



228 CAKES. 

almonds, blanched and beat, with a little rose orwaoge 
flower water, and the white of one egg ; half a pound 
of sifled loaf sugar, eight yolks and three whites of 
eggs, the juice of half a lemon and the rind grated. 
Mix the whole well together, and either bake it in 
one large pan or several small ones. 

Little Plum Cakes. 

Take half a pound of sugar finely powdered, two 
pounds of flour well dried, four yolks and two whites 
of eggs, half a pound of butter washed with rose- 
water, six spoonsful of cream warmed, and a pound 
and a half ot currants unwashed, but picked and rub- 
bed very clean in a cloth. Mix all weU together, then 
make them up into cakes, bake them in a hot oven, 
and let them stand half an hour till thev are coloured 
on both sides. Then take down the oven lid, and let 
them stand to soak. You must rub the butter well 
into the flour, then tiie eggs and cream, and then the 
currants. 

Ratifia Cakes. 

First blanch, and then beat half a pound of sweet 
almonds, and the same quantity of bitter almonds in 
fine orange, rose, or ratifia water, to keep ttie almonds 
firom oiling. Take a pound of fine sugar pounded and 
sifled, and mix it with your ahnonds. Have ready the 
whites of four eggs well beaten, and mix them lightly 
with the almonds and sugar. Put it into a preserving- 
pan, and set it over a moderate fire. Keep stirrhig 
it one way until it is pretty hot, and, when a little cool, 
form it in small rolls, and cut it mto thin cakes. Dip 
your hands in flour, and shake them on them ; give 
each a light tap w ith your finger, and put them on su- 
gar papers. Sift a little sugar on them before you put 
them into the oven, which must be quite slack. 

Apricot Cakes. 

Take a pound of ripe apricots, scald and peel them, 
and, as soon as you find the skin will come ofi*, take 
out the stones. Beat the fruit in a mortar to a pulp ; 



CAKES. 229 

then boil half a pound of double-refined sugar, with a 
spoonful of water, skim it well, and put to it the pulp 
of your apricots. Let it simmer a quarter of an hour 
over a slow fire, and keep stirring it all the time. 
Then pour it into shallow flat glasses, turn them out 
upon glass plates, put them into a stove, and turn them 
once a day till they are dry. 

Orange Cakes, 

Quarter what quantity you please of Seville 
oranges that have very good rinds, and boil them in 
two or three waters till they are tender, and the bitter- 
ness gone off. Skim them, and then lay them on a 
clean napkin to dry. Take all the skins and seeds 
out of the pulp with a knife, shred the peels fine, put 
them to the pulp, weigh them, and put rather more 
than their weight of fine sugar into a pan, with just as 
much water as will dissolve it. Boil it till it becomes 
a perfect sugar, and then by degrees, put in your 
orange-peels and pulp. Stir them well before you set 
them on the fire ; boil it very gently till it looks clear 
and thick, and then put them into flat-bottomed glas- 
ses. Set them in a stove, and keep them in a constant 
and moderate heat ; and when they are candied on the 
top, turn them out upon glasses. 

Lemon Cakes. 

Take the whites of ten eggs, put to them three 
spoonsful of rose or orange-flower water, and beat 
them an hour with a whisk. Then put in a pound of 
beaten and sifted sugar, and grate into it the rind of a 
lemon. When it is well mixed put in the juice of half 
a lemon, and the yolks of ten eggs beat smooth. — 
Just before you put it into the oven, stir in three quar- 
ters of a pound of flour, butter your pan, put it into a 
moderate oven, and an hour wiU bake it. 

Currant Cakes. 

Dry well before a fire a pound and a half of fine 
flour, take a pound of butter, half a pound of fine loaf 



SSO B18CUIT8. 

BQgar well beaten and sifted, foar yolks of eggs, foor 
spoonsful of rose-water, the same ot sack, a little mace, 
and a nutmeg grated. Beat the eggs well, and put 
them to the rose-water and sack. Then put to it the 
sugar and butter. Work them all together, and then 
strew in the currants and flour, having taken care to 
have them ready warmed for mixing. You may make 
six or eight cakes of them ; but mind to bake them of 
a fine brown, and pretty crisp 

Whigs. 

Put half a pint of warm milk to three quarters of 
a pound of fine flour, and mix in it two or three spoons- 
ful of light barm. Cover it up, and set it before the 
fire an hour, in order to make it rise. Work into the 

Saste four ounces of sugar, and the same quantity of 
utter. Make it into cakes or whigs, with as little 
flour as possible, and a few seeds, and bake them in a 
quick oven. 

Common Biscuits. 

Beat eight eggs well up together, and mix with 
them a pound of sifled sugar with the rind of a lemon 
grated. Whisk it about till it looks light, and then 
put in a pound of flour, with a little rose-water. Su- 
gar them over, and bake them on tins, or on papers. 

Sponge Biscuits. 

Beat the yolks of twelve eggs for half an hour; then 
put in a pound and a half of sugar beat and sifted, 
and whisk it till you see it rise in bubbles. Then beat 
the whites to a strong froth, and whisk them well 
with your sugar and yolks. Work in fourteen ounces 
of flour, with the rinds of two lemons grated. Bake 
them in tin moulds buttered, and in a quick oven. — 
They will take about half an hour baking; but before 
you put them into the oven, remember to sift pounded 
sugar over them. 

Spanish Biscuits. 

Take the yolks of eight e^, beat them half an 
hour, and then put to them eight spoonsful of sifted

sagar. Then beat the whites to a strong froth, and 
work them- well with the yolks and si^gar. Put in 
four spoonsful of flour, and a little lemon-peel cut fine* 
Mix all well together, and bake them on paper. 

Drop Biscuits. 

Beat up the whites of six eggs, and the yolks of 
ten, with a spoonful of rose-water, and then put in ten 
ounces of beaten and sifted loaf sugar. Wiiisk them 
well for half an hour, and then add an ounce of car* 
raway-seeds crushed a little, and six ounces of fine 
flour. Mix the whole well together, drop them on 
papers, and bake them in a moderately heated oven. 

LeTOon Biscuits. 

Take the yolks of ten e^, and the whites of five, 
and beat them well together, with four spoonsful of 
orange-flower water, till they froth up. Then put in 
a pound of loaf «ugar ^fied, beat it one way for half 
an hour or more, put in half a pound of flour, with the 
raspings of two lemons, and the pulp of a small one. 
Butter your tin, and bake it in a quick oven ; but do 
not stop up the mouth at first, for fear it should scorch* 
Dust it with sugar before you put it into the oven. 

Macaroons. 

Blanch and beat fine a pound of sweet almonds, 
and put to them a pound of sugar and a little rose* 
water, to keep them firom oiling. Then beat the 
whites of seven eggs to a froth, put them in, and work 
the whole well together. Drop them on wafer-paper, 
grate sugar over them, and put them into the oven. 

Chreen Caps. 

Having gathered as many codlins as yon want, 
just before they are ripe, green them in the same man* 
ner as for preserving. Then rub them' over with a 
little oiled butter, grate double-refined sugar over them, 
and set them in the oven till they look bright, and 
sparkle like firost. Then take them out, and pnt them 



232 BISCUITS^ 4*c. 

into a china dish. Make a very fine custard, and pour 
it round them. Stick single flowers in every apple, 
and serve them up. 

Black Caps. 

Take out the cores, and cut into halves twelve 
large apples. Place them on a tin patty-pan as close 
as they can lie, with the fiat side downwards. Squeeze 
a lemon into two spoonsfiilof orange-fiower water, and 
pour it over them. Shred some lemon-peel fine, and 
throw over them, and grate fine sugar over all. Set 
them in a quick oven, and half an hour will do them. 
When you send them to table, strew fine sugar all ov^er 
the dish. 

Snow Balls. 

Pare and take out the cores of five large baking 
apples, and fill the holes with orange or quince marma- 
lade. Then make some good hot paste, roll your ap- 
ples in it, and make your crust of an equal thickness. 
Put them in a tin dripping-pan, bake them in a mo- 
derate oven, and when you take them out, make icing 
for them, directions for which you will find at the close 
of the second section in the next chapter. Let your 
icing be about a quarter of an inch thick, and set them 
at a good distance firom the fire till they are hardened ; 
but take care you do not let them brown. Put one 
in the middle of a dish, and the others round it.

THE JiRT OF CQJ^ECTIOJVdRr. 

SECT, L 

TU MfitHOD OF PRSPARIIfQ SUGARS AND 

COLOURS. 

THE first process in the art of confectionary is that 
of clarifying sugars, which requires great care and 
attention, and most be done according to the following 
direction : 

Break the white of an egg into yonr preserving-pan» 
put to it fonr quarts of water, and beat it up to a troth 
with a whisk. Then put in twelve pounds of sugar, 
mix all together, and set it over the fire. When it 
boils put in a little cold water, and in this manner 
proceed as many times as may be necessary, till the 
flcum appears thick on the top. Then remove it fix>m 
the fire, and when it is settled take off the scum, and 
pass it through a straining-bag. If the sugar should 
not appear very fine, give it another boil before you 
strain it — This is tiie first operation, having done 
which you may proceed to clarify your sugar to eitiiw 
of the following degrees : 

1. Smooth or Candy Sugar. — ^After having gone 
through the first process, as before directed, put what 
quantity you may have occasion for over the fire, and 
let it boil till it is smooth. This you may know by 
dipping your skimmer into the sugar, and then touch- 
ing it between your fore-finger and thumb, and im- 
mediately on opening them, you will obsene a small 
thread drawn between, which wiU immediately break, 
and remain on a drop on your tlmmb, which will be a 
si^n of its being in some degree of smoothness. Then 
give it another boiling, and it will draw into a larger 
string, when it will have acquired the first degree, 
Bx>m whence we proceed to, 



234 CONFBOTIONART. 

2. Bloom Sugar. — In this degree of refining sugar, 
yon must boil it longer than in the ibnner process, and 
then dip your skimmer in, shaking off what sngar you 
can into the pan then blow with your mouth strongly 
through the holes, and if certain bladders, or bubbles, 
go through, it will be a proof that it has acquired the 
second degree. 

3.^ FecUhered Sugar. — ^To prove this degiee, dip 
the skimmer into the sugar wfaMsn it has boiled longer 
than in the former degrees. When you have so done, 
^ first shake it over the pan, then give it a sudden flirt 
behind you, and if it is enough, the sugar will fly off 
Jike feathers. 

4. Crackled Sugar. — Boil your sugar longer than 
in the preceding degree ; then dip a stick into it, and 
immediately put it into a pan of cold water, w hich you 
must have by you for that purpose. Draw off the 
sugar that hangs to the stick into the water, and if it 
becomes hard, and snaps, it has acquired the proper 
degree ; but if otherwise, you must boil it again till it 
answers that trial. Be particularly carefiil that the 
water you use for this purpose is perfectly cold, other- 
wise you wai be greatty deceived. 

5. Carmel Sugars. — To obtain the last d^;ree, 
your sugar must boil longer than in either of the former 
operations. You must prove it by dipping a stick, first 
into the sugar, and then into cold water ; but this you 
must observe, that when it comes to the carmel height, 
it will^ the moment it touches the water, sn&p like 
glass, which is the highest and last degree of refining 
sugar. When you boil this, take care that your fire is 
not too fierce, lest it should, by flaming up the sides of 
the pan,. cause the sugar to bum, discolour it, and 
thereby destroy all your labour. 

Having thus described tlie various degrees of relink- 
ing sugar, we shall now point out the method of pre- 
paring those colom^ with which they may be tinged, 
according to the fancy, and the different purposes fx 
which they are to be used. 



_„x 



COlfPECTIOIfART. 335 

Bed Colour. 

. To make tius colour, boil an ounce of cochineal in 
half a pint of water, for above five minutes ; then add 
half an ounce of cream of tartar, and half an ounce of 
pounded alum, and boil the whole on a slow fire about 
as long again. In order to kn6w if it is done, dip a 
pen into it, write on white paper, and if it shows the 
colour clear, it is sufficient. Then take it off the fire, 
add two ounces of sugar, and let it settle. Pour it 
clear off, and keep it in a bottle well stopped for use« 

Blue Colour. 

This colour is only for present use, and must be 
made thus : put a little warm water into a plate, and 
rub an indigo stone in it till the colour is come to the 
tint you would have it. The more you rub it, the 
higher the colour will be. 

YeUaw Colour. 

This is done by pouring a little water into a plate, 
and rubbing it with a bit of gamboge. It may also 
be done witii yellow lily thus : take the heart of the 
flower, infuse the colour with milk- warm water, and 
preserve it in a bottle well stopped. 

Green Colour. 

Trim the leaves of some spinach, boil them about 
half a minute in a little water, then strain it clear off, 
and it will be fit for use. 

Any alteration may be made in these colours, by 
mixing to what shade you think proper ; but on these 
occasions taste and fancy must be your guide. 

Devices in Sugar. 

STEBPgum-tragacanth in rose-water, and with some 
double-refined sugar make it into a paste. Colour it 
to your fancy, and make up your device in such forms 
as you may think proper. You may have mouldi^ 
made in various shapes for this purpose^ and your de- 
vieeB will be pretty ornaments placed on the top of iced 
cakes. 



v2S6 c RE Airs. 

Sugar of Roses in various Jigures. 

Chip off the white part of some rose-buds, and dry 
them in the sun. Pound an ounce of them very fine; 
then take a pound of loaf-sugar, wet it in some rose- 
water, and boil it to a candy height; then put in your 
powder of roses, and the juice of a lemon. Mix all well 
togetiier, then put it on a pie-plate, and cut it into lo- 
eenges, or make it into any kind of shapes or figures 
your fancy may draw. It you want to use them as 
ornaments for a desert, you may gild or colour them 
to your taste. 

SECT. 11. 

CREAMS and JAMS. 

Orange Cream. 

Pars off the rind of a Sevflle orange very fine, and 
then squeeze out the juice of four oranges. Put them 
into a stew-pan, with a pint of water, and eight ounces 
of su^ur ; mix with them the whites of five eggs well 
beat, and set the whole over the fire. Stir it one way 
till it becomes thick and white, then strain it tiurough 
a gauze, and keep stirring it till it is cold. Then beat 
the yolks of five eggs very fine, and put it into yomr 
pan with some cream and the other articles. Stir it

the |elly op clean. Leave what settlmg may remam 
at the bottom^ and put the jellv into a saucepan, with 
a pint of moontain wine, half a pound of loaf-sugar, 
and the juice of four lemons. Add to these the whites 
of six or eight eggs well beat up ; stir all well together, 
put it on the fire, and let it boil a few minutes. Pour 
it into a large flannel bag, and repeat it till it runs 
clear ; then have ready a large china basin, and put 
into it some lemon-peel cut as thin as possible. Let 
the jelly run into the basin, and the lemon-peel will 
not only give it a pleasing colour, but a grateful flavour. 
Fill your glasses, and it will be fit for use. 

Hartshorn Jelly. . 

Boil half a pound of hartshorn in three quarts of 
water over a gentle fire, till it becomes a jelly. If you 
take out a little to cool, and it hangs on a spoon, it is 
enough. Strain it while it is hot, put it into a well- tin- 
ned saucepan, and add to it a pint of Rhenish wine« 
and a quarter of a pound of loaf-sugar. Beat the whites 
of four eggs or more to a froth, stir it altogether that 
the whites may mix well with the jelly, and pour it in 
as if you were cooling it. Let it boil two or three 
minutes, then put in the juice of three or four lemons, 
and let it boil a minute or two longer. When it is 
finely curdled, and of a pinre white colour, have ready 
a swan-skin jelly-bag over a china basin, pour in your 
jelly, and pour it back again till it is as clear as rock* 
water ; then set a very clean china basin under, have 
your glasses as clean as possible, and with a clean 
spoon fill them. Have ready some tliin rind of lemons, 
and when you have filled half your glasses, throw your 
peel into the basin. When the jelly is all run out of 
the bag, with a clean spoon fill the rest of t^e glasses, 
and they will look of a fine amber colour. Put in le- 
mon and sugar to your palate, but remember to make 
it pretty sweet, otherwise it will not be palatable. 
No fixed rule can be given for putting in the ingredients, 
which can only be regulated according to taste and 
'fiuiey.

four lemons, and twelve oranges if small, if large eight ; 
let the rinds of six of the oranges be rubbed on some 
sugar, and scraped into your isinglass while boiling ; 
when done, strain it through a fine lawn sieve ; if you 
have any dried crocus flowers to boil in your jelly it 
will give it a fine yellow tinge, and leave no taste. 

Fruit in Jelly. 

Put into a basin half a pint of clear calf's feet jelly, 
and when it is set and stiff, lay in three fine peaches, 
and a bunch of grapes with the stalk upwards. Put

it, turn your jelly carefiiUy out, and serve it to table; 

Blanc Mange. 

There are various methods of maidng this jelly, 
but the best, and those most usually practised are three ; 
the first of which is termed green, and is prepared firom 
isinglass in the following manner : 

Having dissolved your isinglass, put to it two ounces 
of sweet, and the same quantity of bitter almonds, with 
some of the juice of spinach to make it green, and a 
spoonful of French brandy. Set it over a stove fire in 
a saucepan, and let it remain till it is almost ready to 
boil ; then strain it through a gauze sieve, and when it 
grows thick, put it into a melon mould, let lie till the 
next day, and then turn it out. You may garnish it 
with red and white flowers. 

The second method of preparing this jelly is also ficom 
isinglass, and must be done thus : put into a quart of 
Water an ounce of isinglass, and let it boil till it is re« 
duced to a pint; then put in the whites of fear eggc^ 
with two spoonsfiil of rice water, and sweeten it to 



your taste. Run it through a jeBy-bag, and then pat 
to it two ounces of sweet and one ounce of bitter al- 
monds. Give them a scald in yoor jeUy, and then ram 
them through a hair sieve. Then pnt it into a china 
howl, and the next day torn it out. Garnish with 
flowers or green leaves, and stick ail over the (op 
blanched almonds cat lengthways. 

The third sort of blanc mange is called clear, and is 
prepared thus : skim oS the fat, and strain a quart of 
strong calf's feet jelly. Then beat the whites of four 
eggs, and put them to your jelly. Set it over the fire, 
and keep stirring it till it boils. Then pour it into a 
ielly-bag, and run it through several times till it is clear. 
Beat an ounce of sweet and the same quantity of bit* 
ter almonds to a paste, with a spoonful of rose- water 
squeezed through a cloth. Then mix it with the jelly, 
and add to it three spoonsful oi very good cream. Set 
it again over the fire, and keep stirring it till it aknost 
boik. Poor it into a bowl, stir it very often till it is 
aliQOft cold, then wet your moulds, and fill them. 

Jaunmange. 

Take three quarters of on oonce of isinghaa and 
half a pint of water boiled together till the isinglass is 
just dissolved, then put in the rind and juice of a lemon, 
half a pint of mountain wine, and sugar to your palate ; 
after it is all boiled together, let it stand till almost 
cold, then add four yolks of eggs. Pat it again oti the 
fire, till it almost boils, then strain it through a fisa 
lawn sieve, and keep stirring it till cold. 

Black Currant Jelly. 

Let yonr currants be thoroughly ripe, and quite 
dry; strip them dear firom the stalks, and put them 
into a large stew-pot To every ten quarts ot cunanti

dean. Let it bml p»ttjrqnick over a deaor &re, ttU it 
leDies, which is known bj dipping the skimmar into 
your jdly and hokling it ia the air; when it hangs to 
the spoon in a drop, it is done. You way also pQt 
some into a plate to try, and if there eomes a thick 
ddn, it is done. If the jeiiy is boiled too long it will 
koe its flavoor, and shrink very moch. Pour it into 
pots, cover them with brandy papers, and keep them 
m a dry place. Red and white jdly is made in the 
same manner. 

Riband JeUy.

248 8TI.LABUBS. 

Common S%filabub$^ 

Put a pint of cider and a bottle of strong beer in- 
to a large bowl, grate in a small nutmeg, and sweeten 
it to your taste. Then milk from the cow as much 
milk as will make a strong froth. Let it stand an hour« 
and then strew over it a few currants well washed, 

5)icked, and plumed before the fire ; and it will be fit 
or use. 

Whipt Syllabub. 

Rub a lump of loafsugar on the outside of alemon, 
and put it into a pint of tiiick cream, and sweeten it 
to your taste. Then squeeze in the juice of a lemon, 
and add a glass of Madeira wine, or French brandy. 
Mill it to a both with a chocolate-mill, take off the 
froth as it rises, and lay it in a hair sieve. Then fill 
one half of your glasses a little more than half full with 
white wine, and the other half of your glasses a little 
more than half full with red wine. Then lay your 
froth as high as you can, but take care that it is well 
drained on your sieve, otherwise it will nux with the 
wine, and your syllabub be spoiled. 

Solid Syllabub. 

To a quart of rich cream put a pint of white wine, 
the juice of two lemons, with the rind of one grated, 
and sweeten it to your taste. Whip it up welt, and 
take off tha firoth as it rises. Put it upon a hair sieve, 
and let it stand in a cool place till the next day. Then 
half fill your glasses with the skim, and heap up the 
froth as high as you can. The bottom will look clear, 
and it will keep several days. 

Lemon Syllabubs. 

Take fi quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, and rub 
upon the outer rinds of two lemons, till you have got 
all the essence out of them. Then put the sugar into 
a pint of cream, and the same quantity of white wine. 
Squeease in the juice of both lemons, and let it stand 
ior two hours. Then mill it with a chocolate-mill to raise 



SYLLABUBS, dj^C. 249 

the frothy and take it off with a spoon as it lises, or it 
will make it heavy. Lay it upon a hair sieve to drain, 
then fill your glasses with the remainder, and lay on 
the froth as high as you can. Let them stand all night, 
and they will be fit for use. 

Everlasting Syllabubs. 

Take half a pint of Rhenish wine, half a pint of 
sack, with the juice of two large Seville oranges, and 
put them into two pints and a half of thick cream. 
Grate in just the yellow rind of three lemons, and put 
in a pound of double-refined sugar well beaten and 
silled. Mix all together with a spoonful of orange- 
flower water, and with a whisk beat it well together 
for half an hour. Then, with a spoon, take off the 
firoth, lay it on a sieve to drain, and fill your glasses. 
These will keep better than a week, and should always 
be made a day before they are wanted. The best way to 
whip a syllabub is this : have a fine large chocolate-mill, 
which you must keep on purpose, and a large deep bowl 
to mill them in, as this way they will be done quicker, 
and the froth be the stronger. For the thin that is 
left at the bottom, have ready some calf s feet jelly 
boiled and clarified, in which must be nothing but the 
calf's feet boiled to a hard jelly. When it is cold, take 
off the fat, clear it with the whites of eggs, run it 
through a flannel bag, and mix it with the clear left of 
the syllabub. Sweeten it to your palate, give it a boil, 
and then pour it into basins, or such other vessels as 
you may think proper. When cold, turn it out, and 
it will be exceeding fine.

to the dish round the hedgehog, and let it stand till it 
is cold, when its form will have a pleasing effect. 

Flummery. 

Take an ounce of bitter and the same quantity of 
sweet almonds, put them in a basin, and pour over 
them some boiling water to make the skins come off. 
Then strip off the skins, and throw the kernels into 
cold water ; take them out, and beat them in a marble 
mortar, with a little rose-water to keep them from 
oiling; and when they are beat, put them into a pint 
of calPs feet stock : set it over the fire, and sweeten 
it to your taste with loaf sugar. As soon as it boils, 
strain it through a piece of muslin or gauze ; and when 
it is a little cold, put it into a pint of cream, and keep 
stirring it often till it grows thick and cold. Wet your 
moulds in cold water, and pour in the flummery. Let 
them stand about six hours before you turn them out ; 
and if you make your flummery stiff, and wet your 
moulds, it will turn out without putting them in- 
to warm water, which will be a great advantage to the 
look of the figures, as warm water gives a dulness to 
the flummery. 

French Flummery. 

Put an ounce of isinglass beat very fine into a 
quart of cream, and mix them well together. Let it 
boil gently over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, 
and keep it stirring all the time. Then take it ofl^ 
sweeten it to your taste, and put in a spoonful of rose- 
water, and another of orange-flower water. Strain it, 
and pour it into a glass or basin, and when it is cold 
torn it out.

Oreen Melon in Flummery. 

Take a little stiff flammery, and put into it some 
bitter almonds, with as much juice of spinach as will 
make it of a fine pale green. When it becomes as thick 
as good cream, wet your melon-mould, and put it in. 
Then put a pint of clear calf s feet jelly into a large 
basin, and let them stand all night. The next day 
turn out your melon, and lay it in the middle of your 
basin and jelly. Then fill up your basin with jelly 
that is beginning to set, and let it stand all night. 
The next morning turn it out in the same manner as 
directed for the Fruit in Jelly. See p. 246. For 
ornament, put on the top a garland of flowers. 

SolomonyS Temple in Flummery. 

Take a quart of stiff flummery, and divide it into 
three parts. Make one part a pretty thick colour with 
a little cochineal bruised fine, and steeped in French 
brandy. Scrape an ounce of chocolate very fine, dis- 
solve it in a little strong coffee, and mix it with another 
part of your flummery, to make it a light stone colour. 
The last part must be white. Then wet your temple- 
mould, and fit it in a pot to stand even. Fill the top 
of the temple with red flummery for the steps, and the 
four points with white. Then fill it up with chocolate 
flummery, and let it stand till the next day. Then 
loosen it round with a pin, and shake it loose very 
gently ; but do not dip your mould in warm water, as 
that will take off the gloss, and spoil the colour. When 
you turn it out, stick a small sprig of flowers down 
from the top of every point, which will not only 
strengthen it, but give it a pretty appearance. Lay 
round it rock candy sweetmeats. 



SECT. IV. 



PRESERVING FRUIT, &c. 

Some general rules are necessary to be observed in 



252 Irsssrvino 

this part of the Art of Confectionary, and which we 
shall previously notice as well for the instmctioQ as 
reputation of those whose province it naay be occasion- 
ally to use such articles. In the first place remember, 
that in making your syrups, the sugar is well pounded 
and dissolved before you set it on the fire, wUch wif; 
not only make the scum rise well, but cause the syrup 
to have its proper colour. When you preserve cherries, 
damsons, or any other kind of stone firuit, cover them 
with mutton-suet rendered, in order to keep out the 
air, which, if it penetrate, will totally destroy them. 
All wet sweetmeats must be kept in a dry and cool 
place, as they will be subject to grow mouldy and 
damp, and too much heat will destroy their virtue. 
Dip writing paper into brandy, lay it close to the 
sweetmeats, cover them quite tight with paper, and 
they will keep for any length of time without receiving 
the least injury. Without these precautions, all ari 
and endeavours will prove ineffectual. 

Jipncots. 

Gather your apricots before your stones become 
hard, put them into a pan of cold spring water with 
plenty of vine leaves ; set them over a slow fire till 
they are quite yellow, then take them out, and rub 
them with a flannel and salt to take off the lint. Put 
them into the pan to the same water and leaves, co- 
yer them close, set them at a good distance fi*om the 
fire till they are a fine light green, then take them 
carefully up, and pick out all the bad-coloured and 
broken ones. BoU the best gently two or three times 
in a thin syrup, and let them be quite cold each time 
before you boil them. When they look plump and 
clear, make a syrup of double-refined sugar, but not 
too thick ; give your apricots a gentle boil in it, and 
then put them into your pots or glasses. Dip paper 
in brandy, lay it over them, tie it dose, and keep them 
in a dry place fi>r use. 

Peaches. 
:/ Gbt the largest peaches you can, but do not let 



9ttutt«. 269* 

thetB be too ripe. Rnb off the lint with a doth, and 
then run them down the seam with a pin skin deep» 
and cover them with French brandy. Tie a bladder 
over them, and let them stand a week. Then take 
them out, and make a strong syrup for them. Boil 
and skim it well, then put in your peaches, and boil 
them till they look clear; then take them out, and 
put them into pots or glasses. Mix the sjTup with the 
brandy, and wnen it is cold, pour it on your peaches. 
Tie them so close down with a bladder, that no air 
can come to them, otherwise they will turn black, and 
be totally spoiled. 

Quinces. 

These may be preserved either whole or in quar- 
ters, and must be done thus : pare them very thin and 
round, put them into a saucepan, fill it with hard wai- 
ter, and lay the parings over the quinces to keep them 
down. Cover your saucepan close, that none of the 
steam may get out, set them over a slow fire till they 
are soil, and of a fine pink colour, and then let them 
stand till they are cold. Make a good syrup of dou- 
ble refined sugar, and boil, and skim it well; then 
put in your quinces, let them boil ten minutes, take 
them off, and let them stand two or three hours. 
Then boil them till the sjnrup looks thick, and the 
quinces clear. Put them into deep jars, with the 
syrup, and cover them close with brandy-paper and 
leather. 

Barberries. 

To preserve barberries for tarts, you must proceed 
thus : pick the female branches clean from the stalk; 
take their weight of loaf sugar, and put them into a 
jar. Set them in a kettle of boiling water till the 
sugar is melted, and the barberries quite soft, and then 
let them stand all night. The next day put them into 
a preserving pan, and boil them fifteen minutes, then 
put them into jars, tie them close, and set them by for 
use. 

If you intend to preserve your barberries in bunches 
ifou must proceed as follows : haviog procored the 



264' pRssERrtifo 

finest female barberries, select all the largest branches* 
and then pick the rest from the stalks. Put them in 
as much water as will make a syrup for your bunches* 
Boil them till they are soil, then strain them through 
a sieve, and to every pint of juice put a pound and a 
half of loaf sugar. BoU and skim it well, and to every 
pint of syrup put half a pound of barberries in bunches. 
Boil them till they look very fine and clear, then put 
them carefully into pots or glasses, and tie them close 
down wilh paper dipped in brandy. 

Pine-Jljyples. 

These must be taken before they are ripe, and laid 
in strong salt and water for five days. Then put into 
the bottom of a large saucepan a handful of vine-leaves, 
and put in your pine-apples. Fill your pan with vine- 
leaves, and then pour in the salt and water they were 
laid in. Cover it up very close, set them over a slow 
fire, and let them stand till they are of a fine light green. 
Have ready a thin syrup, made of a quart of water, 
and a pound of double-refined sugar.^ When it is al- 
most cold, put it into a deep jar, and put in the pine- 
apples with their tops on. Let them stand a w^eek, 
and take care they are well covered with the syrup. 
When they have stood a week, boil your syrup again, 
and pour it carefully into your jar, lest you break the 
tops of your pine-apples. Let it stand eight or ten 
weeks, and daring that time give the syrup two or 
three boilings to keep it from moulding. Let your 
syrup stand till it is near cold before you put it on ; 
and when your pine-apples look quite full and green, 
take them out of the syrup, and make a thick syrup 
of three pounds of double-refined sugar, with as much 
water as will dissolve it. Boll and skim it well, put 
a few slices of white ginger into it, and when it is 
nearly cold, pour it upon your pineapples. Tie them- 
down close with a bladder, and they will keep many 
years without shrinking. 

drapes. 
. Take some plose bunches (whether white or red u 



FRUITS. 1265 

immaterial) not too ripe, and lay them in a jar. Put 
to them a quarter of a pound of sugar-candy, and fill 
the jar with common brandy. Tie them up dose with 
a bladder, and set them in a dry place. 

Morello Cherries. 

Gather your cherries when they are full ripe, take 
off the stalks, and prick them with a pin. To every 

S^und of cherries put a pound and a Iialf of loaf-sugar, 
eat part of your sugar, strew it over them, and let 
them stand all night. Dissolve the rest of your sugar 
in half a pint of the juice of currants, set it over a slow 
fire, and put in the cherries with the sugar, and give 
them a gentle scald. Then take them carefally out, 
boil your syrup till it is thick, pour it upon the cherries, 
and tie them down close. 

Qreen Chdlins, or other Fine Sauce Apples^ 

Gather them when they are about the size of a 
large walnut, with the stalks and a leaf or two on them. 
Put a handful of vine leaves into a pan of spring wa« 
ter ; then put a layer of codlins, then one of vine leaves, 
and so on till the pan is full. Cover it close to pre- 
vent the steam getting out, and set it on a slow fire. 
When you find them soft, take off the skins with a 
penknife, and then put them in the same water with 
the vine leaves, which must be quite cold, otherwise 
they will be apt to crack. Put in a little roach alum, 
and set them over a very slow fire till they are green^ 
which will be in three or four hours. Then take them 
out, and lay them on a sieve to drain. Make a good 
syrup, and give them a gentle boil once a day for tiu'ee 
days. Then put them into small jars, cover them 
close with brandy-paper, tie them down tight, and set 
them in a dry place. They will keep all the year. 

Oolden Pippins. 

Boil the rind of an orange very tender, and let it 
lay in water two or three days. Take a quart ofgoU 
den pippins, pare, core, quarter, and boil them to a 
f^trong jelly, and run it through a jelly-liag. Then take 



256 PBBSE&riNO 

twelve of ibe largest pippins, pare them, and scnpt 
out the cores. Pat a pint of water into a stew-pan, 
with two pounds of loaf sugar. When it boils, skim 
it, and put in your pippins, with the orange rind in thin 
slices. Let them boil fast till the sugar is very thick, 
and will almost candy. Then put a pint of the pip- 
pin-jelly, and boil them fast till the jelly is quite clear. 
Then squeeze in the juice of a lemon, give it a boil, 
and with the orange-peel, put them into pots or glasses, 
and cover them close. 

Qreen Octge Plums. ' 

Get the finest plums you can, gathered just before 
they are ripe. Put a layer of vine-leaves at the bot- 
tom of your pan, then a layer of plums, and then vine- 
leaves and plums alternately, till the pan is nearly fill- 
ed. Then put in as much water as it will hold, set 
it over a slow fire, and when the plums are hot, and 
begin to crack, take them off, and pare off the skins 
very carefully, putting them into a sieve, as you do 
them. Then lay them in the same water, with a 
layer of leaves between as you did at first, and cover 
them so close that no steam can get out. Hang them 
at a great distance from the fire till they are green, 
which will take at least five or six hours. Then take 
them carefully up, lay them on a hair sieve to drain, 
make a good syrup, and give them a gentle boil in it 
twice a day for two days. Then take them out, put 
them into a fine clear syrup, and cover them close 
down with brandy-paper. 

Oranges. 

Take what number of Seville oranges you think 
proper, cut a hole at the stalk end of each, about the 
size of a sixpence, and scoop out thel pulp quite clean ; 
tie them separately in pieces of muslin, and lay them 
in spring water for two days. Change the water twice 
fevery day, and then boil th^m in the muslin on a slow 
fire till they are quite tender. As the water wastes^ 
put more hot water into the pan, and keep them oo- 
yei^d« Weigh tlie oranges before you scoc^ them, and 



FBUiTd. 257 

to every pound put two pounds of double-refined sugar, 
and a pint of water. Boil the sugar and water with 
the juice of the oranges to a syrup, skim it well, let it 
stand till it is cold, then take the oranges out of the 
muslin, put them into the pan, and let them boil half 
an hour. If they are not quite clear, boil them once 
a day for two or three days. Then pare and core 
some green pippins, and boil them till the w^ater is 
strong of the apple ; but do not stir them, and only put 
them down with the back of a spoon. Strain the wa- 
ter through a jelly-bag till it is quite clear, and then to 
every pint of water put a pound of double-refined sugar, 
and the juice of a lemon strained fine. Boil it up to a 
strong jelly, drain the oranges out of the syrup, and 
put them into glass jars, or pots the size of an orange, 
with the holes upwards. Pour the jelly over them, 
cover them with papers dipped in brandy, and tie them 
close down with a bladder. You may preserve lemons 
in the same manner. 

Raspberries. 

Gather your raspberries on a dry day, when they 
are just turning red, with the stalks on about an inch 
long. Lay them singly on a dish, then beat and sift 
their weight of double-refined sugar, and strew it over 
them. To every quart of raspberries take a quart of 
red-currant juice, and put to it its weight of double- 
refined sugar. Boil and skim it well, then put in your 
raspberries, and give them a scald. Take them off, 
and let them stand for two hours. Then set them on 
again, and make them a Uttle hotter. Proceed in this 
manner two or three times till they look dear ; but do 
not let them boil, as that will make the stalks come off. 
When they are tolerably cool, put them in jelly-glasses 
with the stalks downwards. White raspberries must 
be preserved in the same manner, only observing, that 
instead of red you use white-currant juice. 

Strawberries. 

Gather the finest scarlet strawberries you can, 
with the stalks on, before they are too ripe. Lay them 
8q[>arately on a china dish, then beat and sift twice 

No. lU 2K 



259 PRSSSR7INO 

their weight of doabte-refined sugar, and strew it oyer 
thenr. Take a few ripe scarlet strawberries, crush 
them, and put them into a jar, with their weight of 
double-refined sugar beat small. Cover them close, 
and let them stand in a kettle of boiling water till they 
are soft, and the syrup is extracted from them. Then 
strain them through a muslin rag into a preserving- 
pan, boil and skim it well, and when it is cold, put in 
your whole strawberries, and set them over the fire 
till they are milk warm. Then take them off, and let 
them stand till they are quite cold. Set them on again, 
and make them a little hotter, and do so several time^ 
till they look clear ; but do not let them boil, as that 
will bring off then* stalks. When the strawberries are 
cold, put them into jelly-glasses, with the stalks dovni- 
wards, and fill up your glasses with the syrup. Put 
over them papers dipped in brandy, and tie them down 
close. 

Currants in Bunches. 

Stone them, and tie six or seven bunches together 
with a thread to a piece of split deal about four inches 
long. Put them into the preserving-pan with their 
weight of double-refined sugar beaten and finely sifted, 
and let them stand all night. Then take some pippins, 
pare, core, and boil them, and press them down with 
the back of a spoon, but do not stir them. When the 
water is strong of the apple, add to it the juice of a le- 
mon, and strain it through a jelly-bag till it runs quite 
clear. To every pint of your liquor put a pound of 
double-refined sugar, and boil it up to a strong jelly. 
Then put it to yoiu* currants, and boil them till they 
look clear. Cover them in the preserving-pan with 
paper till they are almost cold, and then put the bunches 
of currants into your glasses, and fill them up with jelly. 
When they are cold, wet papers in brandy and lay 
over them ; then put over them another paper, and tie 
them up close. This method must be pursued with 
either white or red currants. 

To preserve currants for tarts, you must proceed 
thus: to every pound ofcurranto take a pound of sugar. 



FRUITS. 969* 

Put your sugar into a preserving-pan, with as much 
juice of currants as will dissolve it. When it boils, 
skim iU put in your currants, and boil them till they 
are clear. Put them into a jar, lay brandy-paper 
over them, and tie them down close. 

Choseberries. 

Get the largest green gooseberries you can, and 
pick off the black eye, but not the stalk. Set them 
over the fire in a pot of water to scald, but do not let 
them boil, as that will spoil them. When they are 
tender, take them up, and put them into cold water. 
Then take a pound and a half of double-refined sugar 
to a pound of gooseberries, and clarify the sugar with, 
water, a pint to a pound of sugar. When your syrup 
is cold, put the gooseberries singly into your preserving- 

gan, put the syrup to them, and set them on a gentfe 
re. Let them bdil, but not so fast as to break them ; 
and when they have boiled, and you perceive the sugar 
has entered them, take them off, cover them with 
white paper, and set them by all night. The next 
day take them out of the syrup, and boil the syrup till 
it begins to be ropy. Skim it, and put it to them 
again, set them on a slow fire, and let them simmer 
gently till you perceive the syrup will rope. Then 
take them off, set them by till they are cold, and co- 
ver them with brandy-paper. 

If you preserve red gooseberries, you must proceed 
thus : put a pound of loaf-sugar into a preserving-pan^ 
with as much water as will dissolve it, and boil and 
skim it well. Then put in a quart of rough red goose- 
berries, and let them boU a little. Set them by till 
the next day, and then boil them till they look dear^ 
and the syrup is thick. Then put them hito pots, or 
glasses, and cover them with brandy-paper. 

Gooseberries in imitation of Hops. 

, Take the largest green walnut gooseberries you 
can get, and cut them at the stalk end into four quar- 
ters. Leave them whole at the blossom end, take out 



260 PBS8£RVfK0 

all the seeds, and put five or six one in another. Take 
a needlefal of strong thread, with a lar^e knot at the 
end ; run the needle through the bunch of gooseberries, 
tie a knot to fasten them together, and they will resem- 
ble hops, put cold spring water into your pan, with a 
large handful of vine leaves at the bottom ; then three 
qr four layers of gooseberries, \a ith plenty of vine leaves 
between every layer, and over the top of your pan. 
Cover it so that no steam can get out, and set them on 
a slow fire. Take them off as soon as they are scald- 
ing hot, and let them stand till they are cold. Put 
them into a sieve to drain, and make a thin syrup thus : 
to every pint of water put a pound of common loaf 
sugar, and boil it and skim it well. When it is about 
half cold, put in your gooseberries, let them stand till 
the next day, give them one boil a day for three days. 
Then make a syrup thus > to every pint of water put 
in a pound of fine sugar, a slice of ginger, and a lemon- 
peel cut lengthways very fine. Boil and skim it weD, 
give your gooseberries a boil in it, and when they are 
cold, put them into glasses or pots, lay brandy-paper 
over them, and tie them up close. 

Damsons. 

Put your damsons into a skillet over the fire, with 
as much water as will cover them. When they have 
boiled, and the liquor is pretty strong, strain it out, and 
add to every pound of damsons wiped clean, a pound 
of single-refined sugar. Put one third of your sugar 
into the liquor, set it over the fire, and when it simmers 
put in the damsons. Let them have one good boil, 
then take them off, and cover them up close for half 
an hour. Then set them on again, and let them sim- 
mer over the fire after turning them. Then take them 
o'.it, put them into a basin, strew all the sugar that 
was left on them, and pour the hot liquor over them. 
Cover them up, let them stand till the next day, and 
then boil them up again till they are enough. Then 
take them up, and put them into pots ; boil the liquor 
till it jellies, and when it is almost cold, pour it on 



FRUITS. 261 

them. Cover them with paper, tie them close, and set 
them in a dry place. 

Wulnuta. 

There are three different ways of preserving wal- 
nuts, namely, white, black, and green. To preserve 
them white, yon must pare them till the white appears, 
and nothing else. As you do them, throw them into 
salt and water, and let them lie there till your sugar is 
ready. Take three pounds of good loaf sugar, put it 
into your preserving-pan, set it over a charcoal fire, 
and put as much water to it as will just wet the sugar. 
Let it boil, and have ready ten or twelve whites of 
eggs strained, and beat up to a froth. Cover your 
sugar with the froth as it boils, and skim it. Then 
boil and skim it till it is as clear as crystal, and throw 
in your walnuts. Just give them a boil till they are 
tender, then take them out, and lay them in a dish to 
corf. When they are cold, put them into your pre- 
serving-pot, and pour the sugar as warm as milk over 
them. When they are quite cold tie them up. 

In preserving walnuts black, you must proceed thus : 
take those of the smaller kind, put them into salt and 
water, and change the water every day for nine days. 
Then put them into a sieve, and let them stand in the 
air till they begin to turn black. Then put them into 
a jug, pour boUing water over them, and let them 
stand till the next day. Put them into a sieve to 
drain, stick a clove in each end of the walnuts, put 
them into a pan of boiling water, and let them boil 
five minutes. Then take them up, make a thin syrup, 
and scald them in it tliree or four times a day, till your 
walnuts are black and bright. Then make a thin 
syrup with a few cloves, and a little ginger cut in slices. 
Skim it well, pour in your walnuts, boil them five or 
six minutes, and then put them into jars. Lay brandy- 
paper over them, and tie them down close with a 
bladder. The longer they are kept, the better they 
will eat, as time takes off their bitterness. 

Green walnuts must be prepared by the foQowhig 
mode : wipe them very dry, and lay them in salt and 



water fer twenty-four hoars. Then take them oat, and 
wipe them very clean. Have ready a skillet of boiling 
water, throw them in» let them boil a minute, and then 
take them out. Lay them on a coarse cloth, and boil 
your sugar as directed for the white walnuts. Then 
just give them a scald in the sugar, take them up, and 
lay them to cool. Put them into your preserving- 
pot, and proceed as directed for the preserving of white 
walnuts. 

Cucumbers. 
Take the greenest cucumbers, and the most firee 
from seeds you can get ; some small to preserve whole, 
and others large to cut into pieces. Put them into 
strong salt and water in a straight mouthed jar, with 
a cabbage-leaf to keep them down. Set them in a 
warm place till they are yellow, then wash them out, 
and set them over the fire in fresh water, with a little 
salt, and a fresh cabbage-leaf over them. Cover the 
pan very close, but take care they do not boil. If they 
are not of a fine green, change your water, and that 
wiU help them. Then cover them as before, and 
make them hot. When they become of a good green 
take them off the fire, and let them stand till they are 
cold. Then cut the large ones into quarters, take out 
the seed and soft part, then put them into cold water, 
and let them stand two days ; but change the water 
twice every day to take out the salt. Take a pound 
of single-refined sugar, and half a pint of water ; set it 
over the fire, and, when you have skimmed it clean, 
put in thermd of alemon, an d an ounce of ginger with 
the outside scraped off. When your syrup is pretty 
thick, take it off ; and when cold wipe the cucumbers 
•dry, and put them in. Boil the syrup once in two or 
three days for three weeks, and strengthen it if neces- 
•«ary. When you put the syrup to your cucumbers, 
be sure that it is quite cold. Cover them close, and 
flet them in a dry place. 



SECT. V. 

DRYING and CANDYING. 

Before you proceed to dry and candy any kind of 
firuit, let it be first preserved, and so dried in a stove 
or before the fire, that all the syrup may be totally ex* 
tracted. When you have boUed your sugar to the 
candy height, dip in the fruit, and lay them in dishes 
in your stove to dry; then put them into boxes, and 
keep them in a place where they cannot receive in* 
jury either firom heat or damp. 

Dried Apricots 

Take as many apricots as will amount to about a 
ponnd weight, pare and stone them, and then put them 
mto a preserving-pan. Pound and sift half a pound of 
double-refined sugar, strew a little among them, and 
lay the rest over them. When they have been twenty- 
four hours in this state, tarn them three or four times 
in the syrup, and then boil them pretty quick till they 
look clear. When they are cold, take them out, and 
lay them on glasses. Then put them into a stove, and 
turn them the first day every half hour, the second 
day every hour, and so on till they are perfectly dry. 
Put them into boxes covered, and set them by fi)r use. 

• Dried Peaches. 

Pare and stone some of the finest peaches ycfu can 
get ; then put them into a saucepan of boiling water, 
let them boil till they are tender, and then lay them 
on a sieve to drain, rut them again into the same 
saucepan, and cover them with their own weight in 
sugar. Let them lie two or three hours, and then boQ 
them till they are clear, and the syrup pretty thick. 
Cover them close, and let them stand all night ; scald 
them well, and then take them off to cool. When they 
are quite cold, set them on again till they are tho* 
rou^y hot, and continue this for three or fi>ur days. 
Then lay them on plates, and turn them every day 
tin tb^y are qnite dry. 



Candied Angelica. 

Cut your angelica in lengths when young, cover it 
dose, and boil it till it is tender. Then peel it, put it 
in again, and let it simmer and boil till it is green. 
Then take it up, dry it with a cloth, and to every 
pound of stalks put a pound of sugar. Put your stalks 
into an earthen pan, beat your sugar, strew it over 
them, and let them stand two days. Then boil it till 
it is clear and green, and put in a cullender to drain. 
Beat another pound of sugar to powder, and strew it 
over the angelica ; then lay it on plates, and let it 
stand in a slack oven till it is thoroughly dry. 

Green Oage Plums dried. 

Make a thin syrup of half a pound of single-refined 
sugar, skim it well, slit a pound of plums down the 
seam, and put them into the syrup. Keep them scald* 
ing hot till they are tender, and take care they are weQ 
covered with sjrrup, or tiiey will lose their colour. 
Let them stand all night, and then make a rich syrup 
thus: to a pound of double-refined sugar put two 
spoonsful of water, skim it well, and boil it almost to a 
candy. When it is cold, drain your plums out of the 
first syrup, and put them into the thick syrup ; but be 
careful to let the syrup cover them. Set them on the 
fire to scald till they look clear, and then put them into 
a china bowl. When they have stood a week, then take 
them out, and lay them on china dishes. Then put 
them into a stove, and turn them once a day till they 
are dry. 

Dried Cherries. 

Takb what quantity of morello cherries you think 
proper, stone them, and to every pound of cherries put 
a pound and a quarter of fine sugar ; beat and sift it over 
your cherries, and let them stand all night Then take 
them out of their suffar, and to every pound <^ sug»r 
put two spoonsful of water. Boil and skim it well, 
and then put in your cherries. Let your sugar boil 
over them, the next morning strain them, and to 
every pound of syrup put half a pound more sugar.

till it iii a litde thicker, then put in your 
and let them boil gently. The next day strain them, 
put them into a stove, and turn them every day till 
they are dry. 

Dried Damsons. 
Gather your damsons wlien they are full ripe, 
spread them on a coarse cloth, and set them in a very 
cool oven. Let them stand a day or two, and if they 
are not then properly dried, pat them in for a day or 
two longer. Then take them out, lay them in a dry 
place, and they will eat like fresii plums, though even 
m the midst of winter. 

Candied Cassia. 

m 

Take as much of the powder of brown cassia as will 
lie upon a half-crown, with as much musk and amber- 
gris as you think proper. Pound them both w^ell to- 
gether. Then take a quarter of a pound of sugar, boil 
it to a candy height, put in your powder, and mix it 
well together. Pour it into saucers, which must be 
buttered very thin, and when cold, it will slip out 

Lemon and Orange Peels Candied. 

Cut your lemons or oranges long-ways, take out all 
the pulp, and put the rinds into a pretty strong salt 
and hard water for six days. Then boil them in a 
large quantity of spring water till they are tender. 
Take them out, and lay them on a hair sieve to drain. 
Then make a thin syrup of fine loaf sugar, a pound to 
a quart of water. Put in your peels, and boil them 
half an hour, or till they look clear, and have ready m 
thick syrup, made of fine loaf sugar, with as mucbwa* 
ter as will dissolve it. Put in your peels, and boil 
them over a slow fire till you see the syrup candy about 
the pan and peels. TJj^en take them out, and grate 
fine sugar all over them. Lay them on a hair sieve 
to drain, and set them in a stove, or before the fire to 
dry. 

Candied Gfing-er. 

Take an ounce of race ginger grated fine, a pound 
ofloaf sugar beat fine, and put them into a preserving*

pan, mth as much water as will dissolve the sugar. 
Stir them well together over a very slow fire till the 
sugar begins to boU. Then, stir in another pound of 
sugar beat fine, and keep stirring it till it grows thick. 
Then take it off the fire, and drop it in cakes upon 
earthen dishes. Set them in a warm place to dry, and 
they will be hard and brittle, and look wliite. 

Candied Horelioundn 

Let your horehound be boiled in water till the juice 
is quite extracted. Take your sugar, and boil it up to 
a feather, then add your juice to the sugar, and let it 
boil till it is again the same height. Stir it with a 
spoon against the sides of your sugar-pan, till it begins 
to grow thick, then pour it out into a paper case that 
is dusted with fine sugar, and cut it into squares. You 
may dry the horehound, and put it into the sugar finely 
powdered and sifled. 

Candied Mmond Cake, or Gateau JVbga. 

Take some fine powder sugar, put it into your 
stew-pan, and stir it over the fire till the sugar is near- 
ly dissolved ; have ready half a pound of almonds sliced 
and parched. Put them into the sugar you have over 
the fire, and keep stirring them well about till your 
almonds are a nice brown ; take a jelly-mould or stew- 
pan, oil it well, and put your almonds into it ; keep them 
well up to the sides, and when cold, you may turn it 
out to cover a burnt cream or boiled custard ; or it 
may be served up just as it is. Sometimes they are 
ornamented hke Savoy cakes, and look very handsome. 

Candied Rhubarb Cakes. 

Take an ounce of rhubarb in powder, an ounce of 
fine powder-ginger, eighteen ounces of sugar, three 
drops of oil of peppermint ; boil yonr sugar up to a 
feather, then mix all the ingredients, stirring them till 
it begins to grain. Have ready a square paper case, 
sugared with fine powder sugar : when cold, cut them 
in square pieces.

Compote of Crude Orange. 

Cut the upper part of six sweet oranges in snch a 
manner as to put them together as if they were whole. 
Pierce the pulps in several places with a little knife, 
and put in some fine powder sugar ; then replace the 
pieces you have cut off, and serve them up in your 
desert. 

Compote of Apples. 

Take a dozen of golden pippins, pare them nicely, 
and take the core out with a small penknife ; put them 
into some water, and let them be well scalded; theh 
take a little of the water with some sugar, and a few 
apples which may be sliced into it, and let the whole 
boil till it comes to a syrup : then pour it over your 
pippins, and garnish them with dried cherries and le- 
mon-peel cut fine. You must take care that your pip- 
pins are not split. 

Compote of Pears. 

Let what quantity of pears you wish to be nicely 
scalded till soft, then take them out, pare them, and 
throw them into cold water to harden ; take some su- 
gar, cinnamon* red wine, and cloves, and put your 
pears into it ; let them gently boil till a syrup : you 
may add some cochineal to give them a fine colour. 

Compote of Quinces. 

These may be cut in quarters and done in the same 
way as the apples, taking care that the quinces are 
done quite tender before you put them into the sugar. 
Let the syrup of all your compotes be thick before you 
dish them up. 

Orange Chips. 

Get some of the best Seville oranges you can, pare 
them at least about a quarter of an inch broad, and if 
you can keep the parings whole, they will have a pret- 
ty effect When you have pared as many as you in- 
tend, put them into salt and spring water for a day or 
two ; then boil them in a large quantity of spring water 
till they are tender, and drain them on a sieve. Have

ready a thin syrop made df a quart df Water* and a 
pound of siigar. Boil them a few at a timet to fceep 
tliem from bx-eaking till they look clear. Then put tht^n 
into a syrup made of fine loaf, sugar, with as much 
water as will dissolve it, and boil them to a candy 
height. When you take them up, lay them on a sieve, 
and grate double-refined sugar over them. Then put 
them in a stove, or befi>re the fire to dry. 

Orange Marmalade. 

Get the clearest Seville oranges you can, ait them 
in two, take out all the pulp and juice into a basin, 
and pick all the skins and seeds out of it. Boil the 
rinds in hard water till they are tender, and change the 
water two or three times while they are boiling. Thai 
pound them in a marble mortar, and add to it the juice 
«nd pulp. Then put them in the preserving-pan with 
double its weight of loaf sugar, and set it over a slow 
fire. Boil it rather more than half an hour, put it into 
pots, cover it with brandy-paper, and tie it close 
down. 

Apricot Marmalade. 

Apricots that are too ripe for keeping best answer 
this purpose. Boil them in syrup till they will mash, 
and then beat them in a marble mortar to a paste. 
Take half their weightof loaf sugar, and add just water 
enough to dissolve it. Boil and skim it till it looks 
dear, and the syrup like a fine jelly. Then put it in- 
to jCNir Bweetmeat passes, and tie it up close. 

Quince Marmalade 

These must likewise be full ripe for the purpose of 
making marmalade. Pare them, and cut them into 
quarters ; then take out the cores, and put the fruit 
into a saucepan. Cover them with the parings ; nearly 
fill the saucepan with spring- water, cover it close, and 
let them stew over a slow fire till they are soft and of 
a pinlc colour. Then pick out the quinces from the pa* 
rings* and beat them to a pulp in a marble mortar. 
^S/Sm their weight of fine loaf sugar, put as miidi

Then put in your qnincea, boil them gentij three qnar* 
ters of an hour, and keep stirring them all the time. 
When it is cold, put it into flat pots, tie it down dose, 
and set it by for use. 

Transparent Marmalade. 

Cut very pale Seville oranges into quarters, take 
out the pulp, put it into a basin, and pick out the skins 
and seeds. Put the peels into a little salt and water, 
and let them stand all night. Then boil them in a 
good quantity of spring water till they are tender, cat 
them in very thin slices, and put them into the pulp. 
To every pound of marmalade put a pound and a half 
of double-refined sugar, finely beaten, and boil them 
together gentty for twenty minutes ; but if not clear 
and transparent in that time boil it five or six minutes 
longer. Keep stirring it gently all the time, and take 
care you do not break the sUces. When it is cold, put 
it into jelly or sweetmeat glasses, and tie them down 
tight with brandy-paper and a bladder over them. 

Burnt Mmonds. 

Take two pounds of almonds, and put them into 
a stew-pan, with the same quantity of sugar, and a 
pint of water. Set them over a clear coal fire, and 
jet them boil till you find the almonds crack. Then 
lake them off, and stir them about till they are quite 
dry. Put them in a wire sieve, and sifl all the sugar 
firom them. Put the sugar into the pan ajs^ain with a 
little water, and give it a boil. Then pour four spoons- 
fill of cochineal to the sugar to colour it, put the almonds 
into the pan, and keqp stirring them over the fire till 
they are quite dry. Then put them into a large glass, 
jmd they will keep all the year. 

Raspberry Paste. 

Mash a quart of raspberries, strain one half, and 
put the juice to the other half. Boil them a quarter 
of an hour, put to them a pint of red currant juicOt 



270 ORIfAMJBlfTB 111 

and let them boil all together till your raspberries are 
enough. Then put a pomid and a half of double-refined 
sugar into a pan, with as much water as wiU di». 
solve it, and boil ittoa spgaragain. Put in your rasp- 
berries and juicei give tlxem a scald, and pour it into 
glasses or plates. Then put them into a stove, and 
tiirn them at times till they are thoroughly dry. 

Currajit Paste. 
Currant paste may be either redorwhite, accord- 
ing to the colour of the currants you use. Strip your 
currants, put a little juice to them to keep them from 
burning, boil them well, and rub them through a hair 
sieve. Then boil it a quarter of an hour, and to a pint 
of juice put a pound andahalf of double-refined sugar 
pounded and sifted. Shake in your sugar, and when 
it is melted, pour it on plates. Dry it in the same 
manner as the raspberry paste, and turn it into any 
form you like best. 

Gooseberry Paste. 

Take some full grown red gooseberries, just on the 
turn for ripening, cut them in halves, and pick out all 
the seeds. Have ready a pint of currant juice, and 
boil your gooseberries in it till they are tender. Put a 
pouud and a half of double-refined sugar into your pan,

ORNAMENTS in CONFECTIONARY. 

Artificial Fruit. 

At a proper time of the year, take care to save the 
stalks of the fi*uit, with the stones to them. Get some 
tins neatly made in the shape of the fruit you intend 
to imitate, leaving a hole at the top, to put in the stone 



. CONFECTIONARY. 27T 

wA stalk. They must be so contrived as to open in 
the middle, to take out the fruit, and there must also 
be made a frame of wood to fix them in. Great care, 
must be taken to make the tins very smooth in the in-: 
side, otherwise their roughness will mark the fruit;, 
and that they be made exactly of the shape of tlie fruit, 
tliat they are intended to represent. Being prepared, 
with your tins, proceed thus : take two cow-heels, and 
a calf's foot, boil them in a gallon of soft water till they 
are all boiled to rags, and when you have a full quart 
of jelly, strain it through a sieve. Then put it into a 
saucepan, sweeten it, put in a lemon-peel perfumed,, 
and colour it like the fruit you intend to imitate. Stir- 
all together, give it a boil, and fill your tins : then put 
in the stones and the stalks just as the fruit grows, and 
when the jelly is quite cold, open your tins, and put 
on tlie bloom, which may be done by carefully dustuig^ 
on powder-blue. Keep them covered to prevent the 
dust getting to them; and to the eye, art will be an. 
excellent substitute for nature. 

A Dish of Snow. 

Take twelve large apples, and put them into a 
saucepan with cold water* Set them over a slow fire, 
and when they are soft, pour them into a hair sieve ; 
take off the skins, and put the pulp into a basin. Then 
beat the whites of twelve eggs to a very strong froth ; 
beat and sift half a pound of double-refined sugar, and 
strew it into the eggs. Work up the pulp of your ap- 
ples to a strong froth, then beat them altogether till 
they are Uke a stiff snow. Lay it upon a china dish, 
and heap it up as high as you can. Set round it green 
knots ot paste, in imitation of Chinese rails, and stick 
a sprig of myrtle in the middle of the dish. 

Moonshine. 

Get a piece of tin the shape of a half moon, as deep 
as a half pint basin, and one in the shape of a large 
star, and two or three lesser ones. Boil two calPs 
feet in a gallon of water till it comes to a quart, then 



TnL OEIf AMSIITS IN 

etrain it off, and when cold, skim off the fat. Talc» 
half the jdly, and sweeten it with sugar to your palate. 
Beat up the whites of four eggs, stir all together over 
a slow fire till it boils, and then run it tlirough a flan- 
nel bag till clear. Put it in a clean saucepan, and take 
an ounce of sweet almonds, blanched, and beat rer j 
iine in a marble mortar, with two spoonsful of rose- 
water, and two of orange-flower water. Then strain 
it through a coarse cloth, mix it with the jelly, put in 
four spoonsful of thick cream, and stir it altogether till 
it boils. Then have ready the dish you intend it for, 
lay the tin in the shape of a half moon in the middle, 
and the stars round it. Lay little weights on the tins, 
to keep them in the place where you put them. Then 
pour the moonshine into the dish ; and when it is quite 
oold, take out the tins. Then fill up the vacancies 
with clear calf's feet jelly. You may colour your 
moonshine with cochineal and chocolate, to make it 
look like the sky, and your moon and stars will then 
shine the brighter. Garnish it with rock candy sweet- 
meats. 

Floating Island. 

Take a soup-dish of a size proportioned to what 
yon intend to make : but a deep glass set on a china 
dish will answer the purpose better. Take a quart of 
the thickest cream you can get, and make it pretty 
sweet with fine sugar. Pour in a gill of sack, grate 
in the yellow rind of a lemon, and mill the cream till 
it is of a thick firoth : then carefully pour the thin firom 
the firoth into a dish. Cut a French roll, or as many 
as you want, as thin as you can, and put a layer of it 
as light as possible on the cream, then a layer of cur- 
rant jelly, then a very thin layer of roll, then hart&hc^n 
jelly, then French roll, and over that whip your froth 
which you saved off the cream, well milled np, and lay 
it on the top as high as you can heap it. Ornament 
the rim of your dish with figures, fruits, or sweetmealsp 
as you please. This looks very pretty on the middle 
of a table, with candles round it; and you may make 



CONFECTfONARTa. ^73 

H of a9 many diffisrent eoloun» as you fiiiicy, acoording 
to what jellies, jams, or sweetmeats you have. 

Desert Island. 
Take a lump of paste, and form it into a rock three 
inches broad at the top ; tlien colour it, and set it in 
the middle of a deep china dish. Set a cast figure on 
it with a crown on its head, and a knot of rock candy 
at its feet : tlien make a roll of paste an inch thick, 
and stick it on the inner edge of the dish, two parts 
round. Cut eight pieces of eringo-roots, about three 
inches long, and fix them upright to the roll of pasta 
on the edge. Make gravel walks of shot comfits round 
the dish, and set small figures in them. Roll out some 

Saste, and cujt it open like GJiinese rails. Bake it, and 
X it on either side of the gravel walks with gum, and 
form an entrance where the Chinese rails are, with 
two pieces of eringo-root for pillars. 

Chinese Temple, or Obelisk. 

Take an ounce of fine sugar, half an ounce of but- 
ter, and four ounces of fine fiour. Boil the sugar and 
butter in a little water, and when it is cold, beat up an 
egg, and put it to the water, sugar, and butter. Mix 
it with the flour, and make it into a very stiff paste : 
then roll it as thin as possible, have a set of tins in the 
form of a temple, and put the paste upon them* Cut 
it in what form you please upon the separate parts of 
your tins, keeping them separate till baked ; but take 
care to have the paste exactly the size of the tins. 
When you have cut all these parts, bake them in a 
slow oven, and when cold, take them out of the tins, 
and join the parts with strong isinglass and water with 
a camePs hair brush. Set tliem one upon the other, 
as the forjps of the tin moulds will direct you. If you 
cut it neatly, and the paste is rolled very thin, it will 
be a beautiful comer for a large table. If you have 
obelisk moulds, you may make them the same way 
for an opposite comer. Be careful to make the pinarsf 
stronger than the top, that they may not be crushed 
by their weight

CHAPTER XU. 

P ICKLIJ^G. 

PICKLES are essentially necessary to be kept in 
all houses, but particularly such as contain large rami- 
lies ; nor will the prudent and judicious housekeeper 
be without them ; and this for two reasons ; first, to 
avoid the inconvenience of sending for them when 
wanted ; and secondly, from being assured that they are 
done as they ought to be, that is, that they shall have 
their proper colour without that artifice which is likely 
to be prejudicial to those who use tbem. It is too 
common a practice to make use of brass utensils in 
order to. give the pickles a fine green; but this perni- 
cious custom is easily avoided by heating the liquor, 
and keeping it in a proper degree of warmth before 
you pour it on the articles to be pickled. It is usual 
to put pickles into earthen jars, but stone jars are by 
far the best, for though they are more expensive in the 
first purchase, they will be found much cheaper in the 
end ; the earthen vessels are porous, and will conse- 

Suently admit the air, and spoil the pickles, especially 
'they stand any length of time; buttliis will not be 
the case with stone jars. Remember, that when you 
take any pickle out of your jars, be sure never to do it 
with your fingers, as that will spoil the pickle ; but 
always make use of^ a spoon, which you should keep 
entirely for that purpo^se. 

Having mentioned these necessary and general ob- 
servations relative to pickling, we shall now proceed 
to particulars, beginning mth 

Mmigaes. 
Thb proper cucumbers to be used finr this pnrpoas 



pitoKLiNc: 275 

are those of the largest, sort, which must be taken from 
the vines before they are too ripe, or yellow at the ends. 
Cut a piece out of the side, and take oat the seeds with 
an a{^le-8craper or a tea-spoon. Then pat them intd 
Tery strong salt and water for eight or nine days, or 
till they are yellow. Stir them well two or three times 
every day, and put them intd a pan With a large quan- 
tity of vine leaves both over and under them. Beat 
a little roach alum very fine, and put it into the saltand 
water they came out of. Pour it on your cucumbers, 
and set them on a very slow fire for ibur or five hours 
till they are pretty green. Then take them ofit^ and 
drain them in a hair sieve, and when they are cold^ 
put to them a little horse-radish, then mustard-seed, 
two or three heads of garlic, a few pepper-corns, a few 
green cucumbers sliced in small pieces, then horse* 
radish, andthesameasbefore-mentioned. taiyouhave 
filled them. Then take the piece you cut out, and 
sew it on with a large needle and thread, and do all 
the rest in the same manner. Have ready the follow- 
ing pickle : to every gallon of vinegar put an ounce of 
mace, the same of cloves, two ounces of sliced ginger, 
the same of long pepper, Jamaica pepper, three ounces 
of mustard-seed tied up in a bag, four ounces of garlic, 
and a stick of horse-radish cut in slices. Boil them 
five minutes in the vinegar* then pour it upon your 
pickles, tie them down close, and keep them for use« 

Girkins. 

Put a quantity of spring water into a large earthen 
pan, and to every gallon put two pounds of salt. Mix 
them well together, and throw in five hundred girkins* 
When they have been two hours in the salt and water, 
take them out, and put them to drain ; and when they 
are thoroughly dry, put them into your jar. Take a gait 
Ion of the best white wine vinegar, and put it in a 
saucepan, with half an ounce of- cloves and mace, an 
ounce of allspice, the same quantity of mustard-seed, a 
stick of horse-radish cut in slices, six bay-leaves, tw6 
olr three races of ginger, a nutmeg cut in pieces, and a 



S76 FICKL1K0. 



hudfol of salt: Boil up all togetiier, and jpour it over 
the girkins. Cover them close down, and let them 
stand twenty-foor hours. Then pnt th^n into yottr 
saucepan, and let them simmer over the 6re till thej 
are green ; but be careful not to tet them boil, as that 
will spoil them. Then put them into your jar, and 
oover them down close till they are cold. Then tie 
them over with a bladder and a piece of leather, and 
put them in a dry cold place, 

• 

Cucumbers* 

Foft the purpose of pickling, choose the smallest 
encumbers you can get, and be careful they are as free 
from mots as possible. Put them into strong salt and 
water for nine or ten days, or till they are quite yellow, 
and stir them twice a day, at least, or they will grow 
soft. When they are perfectly yellow, pour the water 
from them, and cover them with plenty of vine leaves. 
Set your water over the fire, , and when it boils, pour 
it upon them, and set them upon the hearth to keep 
warm. When the water is nearly cold, make it boih'ng 
hot again, and pour it upon them. Proceed in this 
manner till you perceive they are of a fine green, which 
they will be in four or five times. Be carefiil to keep 
them well covered with vine leaves, with a cloth and 
dish over the top to keep in the steam, which will 
help to green them the sooner. When they are 
greened, put them into a hair sieve to drain, and then 
make the following pickle for them : to every two 
quarts of white wine vinegar, put half an ounce of 
mace, or ten or twelve cloves, an ounce of ginger cut 
into dices, the same of black pepper, and a handfiil of 
salt. Boil them all together for five minutes, pour it 
hot upon your piddes, and tie them down with a blad- 
der for use. 

Cucumbers in slices. 

Taks some large eucumbers before they are too 
ripe, dice themrof the thickness of a crown-piece, and 
pat them into a pewter dish. To every doanen of cu- 



FiCKMN0. 277 

€QmberB slice two large onions ttiin^ and so on till you 
have filled your dish^ or have got the quantity you in* 
tend to pickle ; hut rememher to put a handful of salt 
between every row. Then cover them with another 
pewter dish, and let them stand twenty-four hours. 
Then put them into a cullender, and when they are 
thoroughly dry, put them into a jar, cover them over 
with white wine vinegar, and let them stand four hours. 
Pour the vinegar from them into a saucepan, and boil 
it with a little salt. Put to the cucumbers a little 
mace, a little whole pepper, a large race of ginger 
sliced, and then pour on them the boiling vinegar. 
Cover them close, and when they are cold, tie them 
down, and they will be ready for use in a few days. 

To Keep Cucumbers. 

Choose those that are small, and not too old; pot 
them in jars, and pour over a brine like the French 
beans ; (see p. 281 ;) when you use them take the rind 
off, and dress them in the same manner as others. 

Walnuts. 

There are various methods of pickling walnuts, 
in order to have them of different colours, the number 
of which are four, namely, black, white, olive colour, 
and green ; each of whidi we shall describe in their 
proper order. 

To pickle walnuts black, you must gather them be« 
fere the shells get too hard, which may be known by 
running a pin into them, and always gather them when 
the sun is hot upon them. Put them into strong salt 
and water for nine days, and stir them twice a day^ 
observii^ to change the salt and water every three 
days. Then put them into a hair sieve, and let them 
stand in the air till they turn black. Put them into 
strong stone jars, and pour boiling vinegar over them ; 
cover them up, and let them stand till they are cold. 
Then give the vinegar three moie boilings, pour it each 
time on the walnuts, and let it stand till it is cold be« 
tween every boiling. Tfaen tie them down with paper 



278 picKLiNa. 

and a bladder over them, and let them stand two 
months. When that time has elapsed, take them out 
of the vinegar, and make a pickle for them thos : to 
every two quarts of vinegar put half an onnce of mace, 
and tlie same of cloves ; of black pepper, Jamaica pep^ 
per, long pepper, and ginger, an ounce each, and two 
ounces oi common salt. BoU it ten minutes, then 
pour it but on your walnuts, tie them close down, and 
cover them witli paper ai)4 a. bladder. 

To pickle walnuts white, you must proceed thus : 
having procured a sufficient quantity of walnuts, of the 
largest size, and taken the before-mentioned precaution 
that the shells are not too hard, pare them very thin 
till the white appears, and throw them into spring 
water and a handful of salt as you do theia. Let 
them lie in the water six hours, and put a thin board 
iipon them to keep them under the water. Then set 
a stew-pan with some clean spring water on a char- 
coal fire. Take your nuts out of the water, put them 
into the stew-pan, and let them simmer four or five 
minutes, but be careful they do not boil. Then have 
ready a pan of spring water with a handful of salt in it, 
and stir it till the salt is melted ; then take your nuts 
out of the stew-pan with a wooden ladle, or spoon, 
and put them into the cold water and salt Let them 
stand a quarter of an hour, with the board lying cm 
them to keep them down as before ; for if they are not 
kept under the liquor they will turn black. Then lay 
them on a cloth, and put them into your jar, with 
some blades of mace and nutmeg sliced thin. Mix 
your spice between your nuts, and pour distilled vine- 
gar over them. When your jar is properly filled with 
nuts, pour mutton fat over them, tie them down dose 
with a bladder and leather, and set them in a dry 
place. 

Walnuts to be pickled of an olive colour, must be 
managed thus : having gathered your walnuts, with 
the same precaiitions as before directed, put them into 
strong ale allegar, and tie them down under a bladder 
and paper to keep out the air. J^et them stand twelve 



PIOKLINO. 970 

n^oothfty then take them out of the allegar, and make 
ibr them a pickle of strong allegar. To every quarts 
pat half an ounce of Jamaica pepper, the same of long 
pepper, a quarter of an ounce of mace, the same of 
cloves, a head of garlic, and a little salt. Boil them* 
altogether five or six minuter, and then pour it upon 
your walnuts. As it gets cold, boil it again three times, 
and pour it on them. Then tie them down with & 
bladder, and paper over it ; and if your allegai' is good, 
they will keep several, years, without either turning 
colour or growing soft. Vou may make very good cat* 
sup of the allegar that comes from the walnuts, by add* 
ing a pound of anchovies, an ounce of cloves, the same 
of long and black pepper, a head of garlic, and half a 
pound of common salt, to every gallon of allegar. Boil 
it till it is half reduced, and skim it well. Then bot- 
tle it for use, and it will keep a great while. 

To pickle walnuts grc^n jproceed as follows : make 
use of the large double or French walnuts, gathered 
before the shells are hard. Wrap them singly in vine 
leaves, put a few vine leaves in the bottoip of your jar, 
and nearly fill it with your walnuts. Take cai-e they 
do not touch one another, and put a good many leaves 
over them. Then fill your jar with good allegar, cover 
them close that the air cannot get in, and let them' 
stand for three weelcs. Then pour the allegar from 
them, put firesh leaves at the bottom of another jar, 
take out your walnuts, and wrap them separately in 
fi'esh leaves as quick as possibly you can. Put them 
into your jar with a good many leaves over them, and 
fill it with white wine vinegar. Let them stand tluree 
weeks, pour off your vinegar, and >ATap them up as 
]>efore, with fresh leaves at the bottom and top of your 
jcur. Take fi'esh white wine vinegar, put salt in it till 
it will bear an egg, and add to it mace, doves, nutmeg, 
and garlic. Boil it about eight minutes, and then pour 
it on your walnuts. Tie them close with a paper and 
a bladder, and set them by for use. Be careful to keep 
them covered, and when you take any out for use, if 
flie whole should not be wanted, do not put those left 



280 FicKi^mo. 

agldn into the jar, for by that means tlie whole may 
be qx>iled. 

Med Cabbage. 

Slicb jour cabbage cross ways, then pat it on an 
earthen dish, and sprinkle a handful of salt over it. 
Cover it with another dish, and let it stand twenty* 
four hours. Then put it into a cullender to drain, and 
lay it into your jar. Take a sufficient quantity of white 
wine vinegar to cover it, a few doves, a little mace, 
and allspice. Put them in whole, with a little cochi- 
neal bruised fine. Then boil it up, and poiir it either 
hot or cold upon your cabbage. If the former, let it 
stand till cold, and then tie it dovm for use. 

Onions, 

Take a sufficient number of the smallest onions 
you can get, and put them into salt and water for nine 
days, observing to change the water every day. Then 
put them into jars, and pour firesh boiling salt and wa- 
ter over them. Let them stand close covered till they 
are cold, then make some more salt and water, and 
pour it boiling hot upon them. When it is cold, put 
your onions into a hair sieve to drain, then put them 
mto wide-mouthed bottles, and fill them up with dis- 
tilled vinegar. Put into every bottle a slice or two of 
ginger, a blade of mace, a tea-spoonful of sweet oil, 
(which will keep the onions white,) a bay-*leaf, and as 
much salt as will lay on a sixpence. Cork them well 
up, so that no air can get to them, and set them in a 
dry place. 

Samphire. 

Take what quantity of green samphire you think 
proper, put it into a clean pan, throw over it twoOt 
three handsful of salt, and cover it with spring water. 
When it has lain twenty-four hours, put it into a clean 
saucepan, throw in a handful of salt, and cover it with 
good vinegar. Cover the pan close, set it over a slow 
fire, let it stand till it is just green and crisp, and then 
take it off at that moment ; for should it remain till it 
i$ soft, it will be totally spoiled. Put it into your 



% 



F1CRLIN0. 881 

pickling-p6t, and cover it close. When it is qaite cold/ 
tie it down with a bladder and leather^ and set it by 
for use. Samphire may be preserved all the year by 
keeping it in very strong brine of salt and water, and, 
just before you want to use it, put it for a few minuted 
into some of the best vinegar. 

Kidney Beans. 

Take some young small beans, and put them into 
strong salt and water for three days, stirring them two' 
or three times each day. Then put them into a pan 
with vine leaves both under and over them, and pour 
on them the same water they came out of Cover 
them close, and set them over a very slow fire till they 
are of a fine green. Then put them into a hair sieve 
to drain, and make a pickle for them of white wine 
vinegar, or fine ale allegar. Boil it five or six minutes 
with a little mace, Jamaica pepper, and a race or two. 
of ginger sliced. Then pour it hot upon the beans, 
and tie them down with a bladder and paper. 

To preserve French Beans. 

Take any quantity of French beans you think fit, 
choosing those that are tender and least stringy ; hav- 
ing cut off the ends, boil them a quarter of an hour, 
and shift them into cold water ; then dry them, and put 
them into the jars in which you mean to keep them. 
Pour over your brine till it rises to the rim of the jar; 
then put over some butter that has been heated and is 
half cold, which will congeal upon the French beans,' 
and keep them firom the air. If you do not like to put 
butter you must put mutton suet in the same w^. 
To make the brine, you must take two thu'ds water 
and one of vinegar ; add several pounds according to 
the quantity of brine you would make, a pound to three 
pints. Set it over the fire till the salt is melted ; let * 
it settle, and before you use it pour it off clear. 

Barberries. 
Take a quantity of barberries not over ripe, pick 
off the leaves and dead stalks, and put them into jars, ' 
No. 12. 2 N 



282 PioKLi^o. 

with a large quantity of strong salt and water, and tie 
them down with a bladder. When you see a scum 
rise on the barberries, put them into fresh salt and wa- 
ter ; but they need no vinegar, their own natural ^arp- 
ness being fully sufficient to oreserve them. Cover 
them dose, and set them by ior use. 

Beet Roots. 
. Boil the roots till they are tender, and take off tiie 
skins, cut them in slices, gimp them in the shape of 
wheels, or what other form you please, and put them 
into a jar. Take as much vinegar as you think will 
cover them, and boil it with a little mace, a race of 
ginger sliced, and a few small pieces of horse-radish. 
Pour it hot upon the roots, and tie them down close. 

Radish Pods. 
Gather your radish pods when they are quite 
young, and put them into salt and water all night ; the 
next day boil the salt and water they were laid in, pour 
it upon the pods, and cover your jar close to keep in 
the steam. When it is nearly cpld, make it boiling hot, 
and pour it on again, and continue doing so tiU the 
pods are quite green. Then put them into a sieve to 
drain, and make a pickle for them of white wine vine- 
gar, with a little mace, ginger, long pepper, and horse- 
radish. Pour it boiling hot upon your pods, and when 
it is almost cold, make your vinegar twice as hot as 
before, and pour it upon them. Tie them down with 
a bladder, and set them in a dry place. 

Cauliflowers. 

Take the whitest and closest cauliflowers you can 
get, break the flowers into bunches, and spread them 
on an earthen dish. Lay salt all over them, and let 
them stand for three days to draw out all the water. 
Then put them into jars, and pour boiling salt and 
water upon them. Let them stand all night, then 
drain them in a hair sieve, and put them into glass jars. 
Fill up your jars with distilled vinegar, and tie tiiem 
close down. 



ticKhiVQ. 283 

Jtrtichoke Bottoms. 

Boil your artichokes till you can pull off all the 
leaves, and thoroughly clear the bottoms. Put them 
into salt and water for an hour, then take them out, 
and lay them on a cloth to drain. When they are dry, 
put them into large wide-mouthed glasses, with a Ut- 
ile mace and sliced nutm^ between, and fill them with 
distilled vinegar. Cover them with mutton fat melted, 
and tie them down with leather and a bladder. 

To preserve Artichokes. 

The 7 may be quartered, the chokes taken out, and 
done exactly the same as the French beans. 

Nasturtiums. 

Thb most proper time for gathering the berries is 
soon after the blossoms are gone off. Put them into 
cold salt and water, and change the water for three 
days successively. Make your pickle of white wine 
vinegar, mace, nutmeg sliced, shalots, pepper-corns, 
salt, and horse-radish. Make your pickle pretty strong, 
but do not boil it. When you have drained your ber- 
ries, put them into a jar, pour the pickle to them, and 
tie them down dose. 

Mushrooms. 

Take the smallest mushrooms you can get, put 
them into spring water, and rub them with a piece of 
new flannel dipped in salt. Throw them into cold wa- 
ter as you do them, which will make them keep their 
colour ; then put them into a saucepan, and ttu'ow a 
handful of salt over them. Cover them close, and set 
them over the fire four or five minutes, or till you find 
they are thoroughly hot, and the liquor is drawn out 
from them. Then lav thern between two clean cloths 
till they are cold, put them into glass bottles, imd fill 
them up with distilled vinegar. Put a blade or two of 
mace and a tea-spoonful of sweet oil into every bot- 
tle. Cork them up close, and set then) in a cool place. 
If you have not any distilled vinegar, you may use 



284 PICKLING. 

white wine yinegar, or ale aUegar will do; bat it must 
be boiled with a little mace, salt, and a few slices of 
ginger ; and it must stand till it is cold before you pomr 
it on your mushrooms. 

Mushroom Catsup. 

Take a quantity of the full grown flaps of mush* 
rooms, crush them well with vour hands, and then 
strew a quantity of salt all over them. Let them stand 
all night, and the next day put them into stew-pans. 
Set them in a quick oven for twelve hours, and then 
.strain them through a hair sieve. To every gallon of 
liquor put of cloves, Jamaica and black pepper, and gin- 
ger, one ounce each, and half a pound of common salt. 
Set it on a slow fire, and let it boil till half the liquor is 
wasted away. Then put it into a clean pot, and when 
it is quite cold, bottle it for use. 

Mushroom Powder. 

6e t the largest and the thickest buttons you can, 
peel them, and cut off the root end, but do not wash 
them. Spread them separately on pewter dishes, and 
set them in a slow oven to dry. Let the liquor dry 
tip into the mushrooms, as that will make the powder 
much stronger, and let them continue in the oven till 
you find they will powder. Then beat them in a mar- 
ble mortar, and sift them through a fine sieve, with a 
little chyan pepper and pounded mace. Bottle it quite 
clear, and keep it in a dry place. 

Walnut Catsup. 

Put what quantity of walnuts you think proper into 
jars, cover them with strong cold ale allegar, and tie 
them close for twelve months. Then take out the wal- 
nuts from the allegar, and to every gallon of the liquor 
put two heads of garlic, half a pound of anchovies, a 
quart of red wine, and oiF mace, cloves, long, black, and 
Jamaica pepper, and ginger, an ounce each. Boil 
them all together till the liquor is reduced to half the 
quantity, and the next day bottle it for use. 



9iOKI.Ilf6. 286 

Jlnother Method of making Walnut Catsup. 

Take green walnuts before the shell is formed, and 
grind them in a crab-mill, or ponnd them in a marble 
mortar. Squeeze out the juice throuirh a coarse cloth, 
and put to eve^ gallon of juice a pomd of anchovies, 
the same quantity of bay-salt, four ounces of Jamaica 
pepper, two of long and two of black pepper ; of mace, 
cloves, and ginger, each an ounce, and a stick of horse- 
radish. Boil ail together till reduced to half the quan- 
tity, and then put it into a pot. When it is cold, bot- 
tle it dose, and in three months it will be fit for use. 

Indian Pickle, or PicalUlo. 

Take a cauliflower, a white cabbage, a few small 
cucumbers, radish-pods, kidney-beans, and a little beet- 
root, or any other thing commonly pickled. Put them 
into a hair sieve ; and throw a large handful of salt 
over them. Set them in the sun or before the fire, 
for three days to dry. When all the water is run out 
of them, put them into a large earthen pot in layers, 
and between every layer put a handful of brown mus- 
tard-seed. Then take as much ale allegar as you think 
will cover it, and to every four quarts of allegar put an 
ounce of turmeric. Boil them together, and put it hot 
upon your pickle. Let it stand twelve days upon the 
hearth, or till the pickles are of a bright yellow colour, 
and most of the allegar sucked up. Then take two 
quarts of strong ale allegar, an ounce of mace, the same 
of white pepper, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, and 
the same of long pepper and nutmeg. Beat them all 
together, and boil them ten minutes in the allegar. 
Then pour it upon your pickles, with four ounces of 
peeled garlic. Tie it close down, and set it by for use.

•Asparagus. 

Get the largest asparagus you can, cut off the white 
endsv and wash the green ends in spring water. Then 
put them into a pan of clean water, and let them lie in 
it two or three hours. Put as much taring water hito 
a stew-pao as will nearly fiH it, and thtow in a lai^

handful of gait. Set it on the fire, and when it boib 
put in your grass, not tied up, hut loose, and not too 
many at a time, lest you bre^ the heads. Just scald 
them, and no more ; then take them out with a broad 
skimmer, and lay them on a cloth to oooL Make your 
pickle with a gaUon or more (according to the quantity 
of your asparagus) of white wie vinegar, and an om.cc 
of bay salt. Boil it, and put your asparagus into your 
jar. To a gallon of pickle put two nutmegs, a quar- 
ter of an ounce of mace, and the same quantity of 
whole white pepper. Pour the pickle hot over the 
asparagus, and cover them with a linen cloth three or 
four times double ; and when they have stood a week, 
boil the pickle again. Let them stand a week longer, 
then boil the pickle again, and put it on hot as before. 
When they are cold, cover them close, tie them tight 
down, and keep them in a dry place. 

Parsley pickled Chreen. 

Make a strong salt and water that will bear an egg, 
and throw into it a large quantity of curled parsley. 
Let it stand a week, then take it out to drain, make 
a fresh salt and water as before, and let it stand an- 
other week. Then drain it well, put it into spring 
water, and change it three days successively. Then 
scald it in hard water till it becomes green, take it out, 
and drain it quite dry. Boil a quart of distilled vine- 
gar a few minutes, with two or three blades of mace, 
a nutm^ sliced, and a shalot or two. When it is 
quite cold, pour it on your parsley, with two or three 
dices of horse-radish, and keep it for use. 

Peaches* 

Gather your peaches when they are at the full 
growth, and just before the time of their turning ripe ; 
and be sure they are not bruised. Take as much 
spring water as you think will cover tiian, and make 
it salt enough to bear an e^, for wbidi ptnpose yon 
must use an equal quantity of bay and common nit. 
Then lay in your peaches, and put a thin board or«r 



ricKLiifa. 2&7 

them to keep them mider the water. When they 
have been three days in this state, take tiiem ont> wipe 
them very carefhUy with a fine soft doth, and lay 
them in yonr jar. Then take as much white wine 
vinegar as will fill your jar, and to every gallon put one 
pint of the best well made mustard, two or three heads 
of garlic, a good deal of ginger sliced, and half an ounce 
of cloves, mace, and nutmegs. Mix your pickle well 
together, and pour it over your peaches. Tie them up 
close, and in two months they will be fit for use. 

Nectarines and apricots must be pickled in the same 
manner. 

Golden Pippins. 

Take a number of the finest pippins you can pro- 
cure, firee firom spots and bruises, put them into a pre- 
serving-pan with cold spring water, and set them on 
a charcoal fire. Keep stirring them with a wooden 
spoon till they will peel, but do not let them boil. 
When you have peeled them, put them into the water 
again, with a quarter of a pint of the best vinegar, 
and a quarter of an ounce of alum. Cover them close 
with a pewter dish, and set them on a charcoal fire 
again, but do not let them boil. Keep turning them 
now and then till they look green, then take them out, 
and lay them on a cloth to cool. When they are quite 
cold, put to them the following pickle : to every gal- 
lon of vinegar put two ounces of mustard-seed, two or 
three heads of garlic, a good deal of ginger sliced, 
half an ounce of cloves, mace, and nutmeg. Mix your 
pickle well together, pour it over your pippins, and 
cover them close. 

Grapes. 

Let your grapes be of their fall growth, but not ripe. 
Cut them into small bunches fit for garnishing, and 
put them into a stone jar, with vine-leaves between 
every layer of grapes. Then take spring water, as 
much as will cover them, and put into it a poimd of 
bay salt, and as much wliite salt as will make it bear 
an egg. Dry your bay salV and pound it befiire you 



pot it in, and that will make it melt the sooner. Pot 
it into a pot^and boil and dkim it well; but take off 
only the black scum. When it has boiled a quarter 
of an hour, let it stand to cool and settle; and when 
it is almost cold pour the clear liqnor on the grapes, 
lay vine-leaves on the top, tie them down close with 
a linen cloth, and cover them with a dish. Let them 
stand twetity-fonr hoars, then take them out, lay them 
on a cloth, cover them over with another, and let tiiem 
dry between the cloths. Then take two quarts of 
vin^ar, a quart of spring water, and a pound of coarse 
sugar. Let it boil a Uttle, skim it very clean as it boils, 
and let it stand till it is quite cold. Dry your jar with 
a cloth, put fresh vine-leaves at the bottom and be- 
tween every bunch of grapes, and on the top. Then 
pour the clear of the pickle on the grapes, fill your jar 
that the pickle may be above the grapes, and having 
tied a thin piece of board in a flannel, lay it on the top 
of the jar, to keep the grapes under the liquor. Tie 
them down with a bladder and leather, and when you 
want them for use, take them out with a wooden spoon. 
Be careful you tie them up again quite close, ibr, 
should the air get in, they will be inevitably spoiled. 

Red Currants. 

Takb a quantity of white wine vinegar, and to 
every quart put in half a pound of Lisbon sugar. 
Then pick the worst of your currants and put th^n 
into this liquor ; but put the best of your currants into 
glasses. Then boil your pi(ikle with the worst of your 
currants, and skim it very clean. Boil it till it looks 
of a fine colour, and let it stand till it is cold< Then 
strain it through a cloth, wringing it to get all the co- 
lour you can from the currants. Let it stand to cool 
and settle, then pour it clear into the glasses in a little 
of the pickle, and when it is cold, cover it dose with 
a bladder and leather. To every half pound of sugar 
put a quarter of a pound of white salt. 

Caveach^ or pickled Mackarel. 
Take half a dozen of large mackarel, and cut them 



PICKLING. 289. 

into round jneces. Then take an ounce of beaten pep 
per, three large nutmegs, a little mace/ and a handnil 
of salt. Mix your salt and beaten spice together, then 
make two or three holes in each piece, and with your 
inger thrust the seasoning into the holes. Rub the 
;)ieces all over with the seasoning, fry them brown in 
jil, and let them stand till they are cold. Then put 
them into vinegar, and coyer them with oil. If well 
covered, they will keep a considerable time, and are 
most delicious eating. 

Smelts. 

At that time of the year when smelts are seasona- 
bly abundant, take a quarter of a peck of them, and 
wash, clean, and gut them. Take half an ounce of 
pepper, the same quantity of nutmegs, a quarter of 
an ounce of mace, half an ounce of saltpetre, and 
a quarter of a pound of common salt. Beat all very 
fine, and lay your smelts in rows in a jar. Between 
every layer of smelts strew the seasoning, with four 
or five-bay leaves. Then boil some red wine, and pour 
over them a sufficient quantity to cover them. Cover 
them with a plate, and when cold stop them down 
dose, and put them by for use. A few make a very: 
pretty supper. 

Oysters. 

Take two hundred of the newest and best oysters 
you can get, and be careful to save the liquor in a pan 
as you open them. Cut off the black verge, saving the 
rest, and put them into their owrfliquor. Then put all 
the liquor and oysters into a kettle, boil them half an 
hour on a gentle fire, and do them very slowly, skim- 
ming them as the scum rises. Then take them off the 
fire, take out the oysters, and strain the liquor through 
a fine cloth. Then put in the oysters again, take out 
a pint of the liquor when hot, and put thereto three 
quarters of an ounce of mace, and half an ounce of 
cloves. Just give it one boil, then put it to the oys- 
ters, and stir up the spices well among them. Th^rt 
put in about a spoonftd of salt, thrt;e quarters of a pint 

21/ ... 



290 PICKLING. 

of the best white wine vinegar, and a qoart^ of an 
ounce of whole pepper : let them stand till they are 
cold, and put the oysters, as many as you well can, in- 
to the barrel. Put in as much liquor as the barrel 
will hold, letting them settle awhile, and they will 
soon be fit to eat. Or you may put them in stone jars, 
cover them close with a bladder and leather, and be 
sure they are quite cold beforfe you cover them up. 

in like manner you may do cockles and muscles, 
with this difference only, that there is not any thing to 
be picked off the cockles, and as they are small, the 
before-mentioned ingredients will be sufficient for two 
quarts of muscles ; but take great care to pick out the 
crabs under the tongues, and the little pus which grows 
at the roots. Both cockles and muscles must be wash- 
ed in several waters to cleanse thefkn firom grit. Put 
them into a stew-pan by themselves, cover them close, 
and when they open, pick them out of the shell, firom 
the liquor, and proceed as directed for oysters. 

Artificial Anchoviea. 

Thbse must be made in the following manner: 
to a peck of sprats put two pounds of common salt, a 
quarter of a pound of bay salt, four of saltpetre, two 
ounces of prunella salt, and a small quantity of cochineal. 
Pound all in a mortar, put them into a stone-pan, a row 
of sprats, then a layer of your compound, and so on 
alternately to the top. Press them hard down, cover 
them close, let then^ stand six months, and they will 
be fit for use. Remember that your sprats are as fresh 
as you can possibly get them, and that you neither 
warn or. wipe them, but do them as they come out of 
the water. 

Ox Palates. 

Wash the palates well with salt and water, and 
put them into a pipkin with some clean salt and water. 
When they are ready to boil, skim them well, and put 
to them as much pepper, cloves, and mace, as will give 
them a quick taste. When they are boiled tender, 
which will require four or five hours, peel them, and 



COLLARIlfO. 291 

cQt them into small pieces, and let them oooL Then 
make the pickle of an equal- quantity of white wine 
and vinegar. Boil the pickle, and pat in the spices 
that were boiled in the palates. When both the pickle 
and palates are cold, lay your palates in a jar, and put 
to them a few bay-leaves, and a little fresh roice. 
Pour the pickle over them, cover them close, and keep 
them for use. 



CHAPTER XXII. 

COLLARIJ^Q. 

ONE very material thing to be generally and indis- 
pensably observed in the business of collaring any kind 
of meat is, that you roll it up well, and bind it as tight 
as possible, otherwise when it is cut it will break in 
pieces, and its beauty be entirely lost. Be careful that 
you boil it enough, but not too much, and let it be quite 
cold before you put it into the pickle. After it has 
lain all night in &e pickle, take off the binding, put it 
into a dish, and when it is cut, the skin will look dear^ 
and the meat have its proper soUdity. 

Venison, 
Bone a side of venison, take away all the sinews, 
and cut it into square collars of what size you please. 
It will make two or three collars. Lard it with fat 
clear bacon, and cut your lard as big as the top of your 
finger, and three or four inches long. Season your 
venison with pepper, salt, cloves, and nutmeg. Koll 
up your collars, and tie them dose with coarse tape ; 
then put them into deep pots with seasonings at the 
bottoms, some fresh butter, and three or four bay- 
leaves. Put the rest of the seasoning and butter on 
the top, and over that some beef-suet, finely shred and 
beaten. Then cover up your pots with coarse paste, 
and bake them four or five hours. After that take 
them out of the oven, and let them stand a littie, take 
out your venison, and let it drain well from the gravy ; 



292 C'btLARlNG. 

add more butter to the fiifc and set it over a gentle fird 
to clarify. Then take it off, let it stand a little, and 
skim it well. Make your pots clean, or hare pots ready 
fit for each collar. Put a little seasoning and some of 
your clarified butter at the bottom ; then put in your 
venison, and fill up your pot with clarified butter, and 
be sure that your butter be an inch above the meat. 
When it is thoroughly cold, tie it down with double 
paper, and lay a tile on the top. They will keep six 
or eight months ; and you may, when you use a pot, 
put it for a minute into boiling water, and it will come 
out whole. Let it stand till it is cold, stick it round 
with bay-leaves, and a sprig at the top, and serve it 
up. 

Breast of Veal. 

Bone your veal, and beat it a little. Rub it over 
with the yolk of an egg, and strew on it a Kttle beaten 
mace, nutmeg, pepper and salt : a large handful of 
parsley chopped smaU, with a few sprigs of sweet mar- 
jorum, a little lemon-peel shred fine, an anchovy chop- 
gd small, and mixed with a few crumbs of bread, 
oil it up very tight, bind it hard with a fillet, and 
wrap it in a clean cloth. Boil it two hours and a half 
in sofl water, and when it is enough, hang it up by one 
end, and make a pickle for it, consisting of a pint of 
salt and water, with half a pint of vinegar. Before you 
send it to table, cut off a sUce at each of the ends. 
Garnish with pickles and parsley. . 

Breast of Mutton. 

Pare off the skin of a breast of mutton, and with a 
sharp knife nicely take out all the bones, but be care- 
ful you do not cut through the meat. Pick all the fat 
and meat off the bones, then grate some nutmeg all 
over the inside of the mutton, a very little beaten mace, 
a little pepper and salt, a few sweet herbs shred small, 
a few crumbs of bread, and the bits of fat picked off 
the bones. Roll it up tight, stick a skewer in to hold 
it together, but do it in such a manner that the collar 
may stand upright in the dish. Tie a packthread 



COLLARING* 293 

across it to hold it together, spit it, then roll the can! 
of a breast of veal all rotmd it, and roast it. When it 
has been about an hour at the fire, take off the caul, 
dredge it with flour, baste it well with firesh butter, and 
let it be of a fine brown. It will require on the whole, 
an hoin" and a quarter roasting. For saucf3 take some 
gravy beef, cut and hack it well, then floui* it, and fry • 
it a little brown. Pour into your stew-pan some boil- 
ing water, stir it well together, and then fill your pan 
half fiill of water. Put in an onion, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, a Uttle crust of bread toasted, two or three 
blades of mace, fi>or cloves, some whole pepper, and 
the bones of the mutton. Cover it close, and let it 
stew till it is quite rich and thick. Then strain it, 
boil it up with some truffles and morels, a few mush- 
rooms, a qpoonfiil of catsup, and (if you have them) 
two or three bottoms of artichokes. Put just enough 
salt to season the ^avy, take the packthread off the 
mutton, and set it upright in the dish. Cut the sweet- 
bread into four pieces, and boil it of a fine brown, and 
have ready a few forcemeat balls firied. Lay these- 
round your dish, and pour ia the sauce. Garnish with 
sliced lemon. 

Beef. 
Take a piece of thin flardcof beef, and bone it; cut 
off the skin, and salt it with two ounces of saltpetre, 
two ounces of sal prunella, the same quantity of bay- 
salt, half a pound of coarse sugar, and two pounds of 
common salt. Beat the hard salts very fine, and mix 
all together. Turn it every day, and rub it well with 
the brine for eight days ; then take it 6ut, wash it, 
and wipe it, dry. Take a quarter of an ounce of cloves, 
a quarter of an ounce of ttiace, twelve corns of allspice, 
and a nutm^ beat very fine, with a spoonful of beaten 
pepper, a large quantify of chopped parsley, and some 
sweet herbs shred fine. Spriidde this mixture on the 
beef, and roll it up very tight ; put a coarse cloth round 
it, and tie it very tight with beggar^s tape. Boil it in 
a copper of water, and if it is a large collar, it will 
take six hours boiling, but a small one will be done in 



294 COLLARING. 

five. When it is done, take it out, and put it into a 
press ; but if you have not that convenience, put it be- 
tween two hoards, with a weight on the uppermost, 
and let it remain in that state till it is thoroughly cold. 
Then take it out of the cloth, cut it into thin slices, lay 
them on a dish, and serve them to table. Garnish 
your dish with raw parsley. 

Calf 8 Head. 

Take a calf s head with the skin on, scald off the 
hair, take out all the bones carefully from the neck, and 
lay it some time in warm milk to make it look white. 
Boil the tongue, peel it, cut that and the palate into 
thin slices, and put them and the eyes into the middle 
of the head. Take some pepper, salt, cloves, and 
mace, and beat them fine ; and add to them some grated 
nutmeg, scalded parsley, thyme, savory, and sweet 
marjorum, cut very small. Beat up the yolks of three 
or four eggs, spread them over the head, and then 
strew on the seasoning. Roll it up very tight, tie it 
sound with tape, and boil it gently for three hours in 
as much water as will cover it. When you take it out, 
season the pickle with salt, pepper, and spice, and add 
to it a pint of white wine vinegar. When it is cold 
put in the collar, and cut it in handsome slices wfara 
you send it to table. 






Bone your pig, and then rub it all over with pep- 
per and salt beaten fine, a few sage leaves, and sweet 
herbs chopped small. Roll it up tijO^ht, and bind it 
with a fillet. Fill your boiler with soft water, put in a 
bunch of sweet herbs, a few pepper-corns, a blade or 
two of mace, eight or ten cloves, a handfiil of salt, and 
a pint of vinegar. When it boils, put in your pig, and 
let it boil till it is tender. Then take it up, and when 
it is almost cold, bind it over again, put it into an 
earthen pot, and pour the liquor your pig was boOed 
in upon it. Be careful to cover it close down after yon 
cut any for use. 



COLLARINO. 296 

Eels. 
Wren you have thorongfaly cleansed yoor eel, cut 
off the heady tail, and fins, and take out the bones. 
Lay it flat on the back, and then grate over it a smafi 
nntmeg, with 'two or three blades of mace beat fine, 
and a little pepper and salt, and strew on these a hand- 
ful of parsleyshred fine, with a few sage leaves chop- 
ped smaU. RoU it up tight in a cloth, and bind it tight. 
If it is of a middle size, boil it in salt and water thi*ee 
quarters of an hour, and hang it up all night to drain. 
Add to the pickle a pint of vinegar, a few pepper-corns, 
and a sprig of sweet niarjorum ; boil it ten minutes, 
and let it stand till the next day. Then take off the 
cloth, and put your eels into the pickles. When you 
send them to table, lay them either whole in the plate, 
or cut them in sUces. Garnish with green parsley. 
Lampreys may be done in the same manner. 

Mackarel. 

Gut your mackarel, and slit them down the belly; 
cut off their heads, take out the bones, and be careful 
not to cut them m holes. Then lay them flat upon 
their backs, season them with mace, nutm^, pepper, 
and salt, and a handful of parsley slured fine ; strew it 
over them, roll them tight, and tie them well separate- 
ly in cloths. Boil them gently twenty minutes in 
vinegar, salt, and water, then take them out, put them 
into a pot, and pour the liquor on themi or the cloth 
wiU stick to the fish. Take the doth off the fish the 
next day, put a UtUe more vinegar to the pickle, and 
keep them for use. * When you send them to table gar- 
nish with fennel and parsley, and put some of the liquor 
under them. 

Salmon* 

Take a side of salmon, cut off the tail, then wash 
the fleshy part well, and dry it with a cloth. Rub it 
over with the yolks of eggs, and make some forcemeat 
with what you cut off at the tail end. Take off the skin, 
and put to it some parboiled oysters, a tail or two of 
lobsters, the yolks of three or four eggs boiled hard, six 



296 POTTING. 

anchovies, a handful of sweet herbs chopped small, a 
little salt, doves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and grated 
bread. Work all these well together, vdth yolks of 
eggs, lay it over the fleshy part, and strew on it a little 
pepper and salt. Then roll it up into a collar, and 
bind it with broad tape. Boil it in water, salt, and 
vin^;ar, but let the liquor boil before you put it in, 
and throw in a bunch of sweet herbs, with some sliced 
ginger and nutmeg. Let it boil gently liear two hours, 
and then take it up. Put it into a pan, and when 
the pickle is cold, put it to your salmon, and let it lay 
in it till wanted. If you cover it with clarified butter, 
it will keep a considerable time. 



CHAPTER XXin. 

P O T T IJ^ G. 

IN this mode of cookery, be sure to make it a rule, 
that whatever you do it is well covered with clarified 
butter before you send it to the oven, tie it dose with 
strong paper, and let it be well baked. When it comes 
firom the oven, pick out every bit of skin you can, and 
drain away the gravy, otherwise the article potted 
vnll be apt to turn sour. Beat your seasoning very 
fine, and strew it on gradually. Before you put it 
into your pot, press it well, and before you put on your 
clarified bul|fer, let it be perfectly cold. 



SECT. L 

MEAT and POULTRY. 

Venison. 

Rub your venison all over with red wine; season 
it with beaten mace, pepper and salt ; put it into an 
earthen dish, and pour over it half a pint of red wine, 
and a pound of butter, and then send it to the oven. 
If it be a shoulder, put a coarse paste over it, and let 



POTTING. 297 

it lay in the oven all night. When it comes out, pick 
the meat clean from the bones, and beat it in a marble 
mortar, with the fat from your gravy. If yon find it 
not sufficiently seasoned, add more, with clarified but- 
ter, and keep beating it till it becomes like a fine paste. 
Then press it hard down into your pots, pour clarified 
butter over it, and keep it in a dry place. 

Hares. 
Case your hare, wash it thoroughly clean, then cut 
it up as you would do for eating ; put it into a pot, and 
season it with pepper, salt, and mace. Put on it a 
pound of butter, tie it down close, and bake it in a 
bread oven. When it comes out, pick the meat clean 
from the bones, and pound it very fine in a mortar, 
with the fat from your gravy. Then put it close down 
in your pots, and poor over it clarified butter. 

Marble Veal. 

Boil, skin, and cut a dried tongue as thin as possi- 
ble, and beat it well with near a pound of butter, and 
a little beaten mace, till it is like a paste. Have rea- 
dy some veal stewed, and beat in the same manner. 
Then put some veal into potting-pots, thin some tongue 
in lumps over the veal. . Do not lay on your tongue 
in any form, but let it be in lumps, and it will then cut 
like marble. Fill your pot close up with veal, press 
it very hard down, and pour clarified butter over it. 
Remember to keep it in a dry place, and when you 
send it to table, cut it into slices. Garnish it with 
parsley. 

Torques 

Take a fine neat's tongue, and rub it well over 
with an ounce of saltpetre and four ounces of brown su- 
gar, and let it lie two dajrs. Then boil it till it is quite 
tender, and take off the skin and side bits. Cut the 
tongue in very thin slices, and beat it in a marble mor- 
tar with » pound of clarified butter, and season it to 
your taste with pepper, salt, and mace. Beat all as 
fine as possible, then press it close down in small pot- 
ting-potSt and pour over them clarified butter.

Cteese and Fowls* 

Boil a dried tongcie till it is t^ider; then take a 
goose and a large fowl, and bone them. Take a quar- 
ter of an ounce of maoe, the same quantity of olives, a 
large nutmeg, a quarter of an ounce of black pepper, 
and beat all well together, add to these a spooniul of 
salt, and rub the tongue and inside of the fowl wdl 
with them. Put the tongue into the fowl, then season 
the goose, and fiU it vidth the fowl and tongue, and the 
goose will look as if it was whole. Lay it in a pan 
that will just hold it, melt fresh butter enough to cover 
it, send it to the oven, and bake it an hour and a half. 
Then take out the meat, drain the butter carefully 
firom it, and lay it on a coarse cloth till it is cold. 
Then take off tne hard fat from the gravy, and lay it 
before the fire to melt. Put your meat again into the 
pot, and pour your butter over it. If there is not 
enough, clarify more, and let the butter be an inch 
above the meat. It will keep a great while, cut fine, 
and look beautiful, and when you cut it let it be cross- 
ways. It makes a i^ery pretty comer-dish fw dinner, 
or side-dish for supper. 

Beef. 

Take half a pound of brown sugar, and an ounce 
of saltpetre, and rub it into twelve pounds of beef. 
Let it lie twenty-four hours ; then wash it clean, and 
dry it well with a cloth. Season it to your taste with 
pq>per, salt, and mace, and cut it into five or six {ueces. 
Put it into an earthen pot, with a pound of batter 
in lumps upon it, set it in a hot oven, and let it stand 
three hours, then take it out, cut off the hard outsides, 
and beat it in a mortar. Add to it a little more pep- 
per, salt, and mace. Then oil a pound of butter in the 
gravy and fat that came from your beef, and put in as 
you find necessary; but beat the meat very fine. 
Then put it into your pot, press it close down, pour 
clarified butter over it, and keep it m a dry place. 

Another method of potting beef) and which will 
greatly imitate venison, is this : Take a buttock of 
beef, and cut the lean of it into pieces of about a 



POTTING. 299 

E>imd i;viei|^t each. To ei|^t 'pounds of beef take 
or ounces of sal^)etre, the same quantity of bay-salt, 
half a pound of white salt, and an ounce of sal pru- 
nella. Beat all the salt very fine, mix them well to- 
gether, and rub them into the beef. Then let it lie 
four days, turning it twice a day. After that put it 
mto a pan, and cover it with pump water, and a little 
of its own brine. Send it to the oven, and bake it till 
it is tender ; then drain it firom the gravy, and take out 
all the skin and sinews. Pound the meat well in a 
mortar, lay it in a broad dish, and mix on it an ounce 
of cloves and mace, three quarters of an ounce of pep- 
per, and a nutmeg, all beat very fine. Mix tbe whole 
well with the meat, and add a little clarified firesh butter 
to moisten it. Then press it down into pots very hard, 
set them at the mouth of the oven just to settle, and 
then cover them tWo inches thick with clarified butter. 
When quite cold, cover the pots over with white pa- 
per tied close, and set them in a dry place. It will 
keep good a considerable time. 

eons. 

Pick and draw your pigeons, cut off the pinions, 
wash them clean, and put them in a sieve to drain. 
Then dry them with a doth, and season th^oi with 
pepper and salt. Roll a lump of butter in chopped 
parsley, and put it iQto the pigeons. Sew up the vents, 
then put them into a pot wiUi butter over them, tie 
them down, and set them in a moderately heated oven. 
When they come out, put them into your pots, and 
poor clarified butter over them. 

Woodcocks. 

Takx six woodcocks, pluck them, and draw out 
the train. Skewer their bills through their thighs, 
put their 1^ through each other, and their feet upon 
their breasts. Season them with three or four blades 
of mace, and a little pepper and salt. Then put them 
into a deep pot, with a pound of butter over them, 
and tie a strong pap^ over them. Bake them in a 



300 FISH. 

moderate oven, and when they are enough, lay them 
on a dish to drain the gravy from them, then put them 
into potting-pots ; take all the clear butter from your 
gravy, and put it upon them. Fill up your pots with 
clarified butter. Keep them in a dry plac« for use. 
Snipes must be done in the same manner. 



SECT. II. 

FISH. 

Take a large eel, and when you have skinned, 
washed clean, and thoroughly dried it with a cloth, 
cut it into pieces about four inches long. Season them 
with a little beaten mace and nutmeg, pepper, salt, 
and a little sal prunella beat fine. Lay them in a pan, 
and pour as much clarified butter over them as will 
cover them. Bake them half an hour in a quick oven ; 
but the size of your eels must be the general rule to 
determine what time they will take baking. Take 
them out with a fork, and lay them on a coarse cloth 
to drain. When they are quite cold, season them again 
with the like seasoning, and lay them close in the pot 
Then take oflf the butter they were baked in clear from 
the gravy of the fish, and set it in a dish before the fire. 
When it is melted, pour the butter over them, and 
put them by for ase. You may bone your eels, if you 
choose ; but in that case you must put in no sal prunella. 

Salmon. 

Take a large piece of fresh salmon, scale it, and 
wipe it clean. Then season it vdth Jamaica pepper, 
black pepper, mace, and cloves, beat fine, and mixed 
with salt, and a little sal prunella : then pour clarified 
butter over it, and bake it well. When it is done, take 
it out carefully, and lay it on a cloth to drain. As 
soon as it is quite cold, season it again, lay it close in 
your pot, and cover it with clarified butter. Or you 
may pot it in tlus manner : 

Scale and clean a whole salmon, slit it down the 
back, dry it well> and cut it as near the shape of your 



FISH. 301 

. pot as yon can. Then take two nntmegs, an onnce 
of mace and cloves beaten, half an ounce of white 
pepper, and an ounce of salt. Then take out all the 
bones, cut off the tail and the head below the fins. 
Season the scaly side first, and lay that at the bottom 
of the pot ; then rub the seasoning on the other side, 
cover it with a dish, and let it stand all night. It must 
be put double, and the scaly sides top and bottom. 
Put some butter Bit the bottom and top, and cover the 
pot with some stiff coarse paste. If it is a large fish, 
it will require three hours baking ; but if a small one, 
two hours will be sufficient. When it comes out of 
the oven, let it stand half an hour, then uncover it, 
raise it up at one end that the gravy may run out, 
and put a trencher and weight on it effectually to an- 
swer this purpose. When the butter is cold take it 
out clear firom the gravy, add more butter to it, and 
put it in a pan before the fire. When it is melted 
pour it over the salmon, and as soon as it is cold, pa- 
per it up, put it in a dry place, and it will keep a con- 
siderable time. Carp, tench, trout, and several other 
sorts of fish, may be potted in the same'manner. 

Lobster. 

Boil a live lobster in salt and water, and stick a 
skewer in the vent to prevent the water getting in. 
As soon as it is cold, t£^e out all the flesh, beat it fine 
in a mortar, and season it with beaten mace, grated 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Mix all together, melt a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut, and mix it with 
the lobster as you beat it. When it is beat to a paste, 
put it into your' pot, and press it down as dose and 
hard as you can. Then set some butter in a deep broad 
pan before the fire, and when it is all melted, take off 
the scum at the top, if any, and pour the dear butter 
over the fish as thick as a crown-piece. The whey 
and chum-milk will settle at the bottom of the pan ; 
but take care that none of that goes in, and always 
let your butter be very good, or you will spoD all. If 
you choose it, you may put in the meat whole, with the 



I 



son cumifiG. 

body mixed amxmg it, laying them as clofle togietfaer ai 
you can, and pouring the butter over them. 



CHAPTER XIIV. 

CURING VARIOUS KINDS OF MEATS, SOUSINGS, ^-C. 

Hams. 
CUT off a fine ham from a fat hind quarter of pork. 
Take two ounces of saltpetre, a pound of coarse sugar, 
a pound of common salt, and two ounces of sal pro- 
ndUa ; mix all together, and rub it well. Let it lie 
a month in this pickle, turning and basting it every 
day; then hang it in a wood smdce in a dry place, so 
that no heat comes to it ; and, if you intend to keep 
them long, hang them a month or two in a damp place, 
and it will make them cut fine and short. Never lay 
these hams in water till you boil them, and then boil 
them in a copper, if yon have one, or the largest pot 
you have. Put them into the water cold, and let them 
be fi>ur or five hoars before they boil. Skim the pot 
well, and oflen, till it boils. If it is a very large one, 
three hours wiU boil it ; if a small one, two hours will 
do, provided it is a great while before the water boils. 
Take it up half an hour before dinner, pull off the 
skin, and throw raspings, finely sifled, all over. Hold 
a red-hot salamander over it, and when dinner is rea- 
dy, take a few raspings in a sieve, and sifl all over the 
di^, then lay in your ham, and with your finger make 
figures round the edge of your dish. Be sure to boil 
your ham in as much water as you can, and keep skim- 
ming it all the time it boils* The pickle you take your 
bam out of will do finely for tongues. Let them lay 
in it a fortnight, and then lay them in a place where 
there is wood smoke, to dry. When you l»roil any 
slices of ham or bacon, have some boiling water ready, 
let them lay a minute or two in it, and then put them 
on a gridiron. This is a very good method, as it 
takes out the violence of the salt, and makes them 
kiave a fine flavour. 



oimiNQ. 309 

Hame the Yorkahire Wety. 

Mix wen together half a peck of salt, three ounces 
of saltpetre, half an omiee of sal pronella, and five 
pounds of very coarse salt. Rab the hams well with 
this : pnt them into a large pan or pickling-tub, and lay 
the remainder on the top. Let them lie three days, 
and then hang them np. Put as much water to tiie 
pickle as will cover the hams, adding salt till it will 
bear an egg, and then boil and strain it. The nesit 
morning put in the hams, and press them down so that 
they n)ay be covered. Let them lay a fortnight, then 
rub them well with bran, and dry them^ The quan- 
tity of ingredients here directed, is for doing three 
middle-sized hams at once, so that if you do only one, 
you must proportion the quantity of each article. 

Kew England Hams. 

Get two fine hams, and in the mode of cure for this 
purpose, proceed as follows : take two ounces of sal 
prunella, beat it fine, mb it well in, and let them lie 
twenty-four hours. Then take half a pound of bay-* 
salty a Quarter of a pound of common salt, and one 
ounce of saltpetre, all beat fine, and half a pound of the 
coarsest sugar. Rub all these well in, and let them 
lie two or three days. Then take some white comn 
mon salt, and make a pretty strong brine, with about 
two gallons of water and half a pound of brown sugar* 
Boil it weU, and scum it when cold ; put in the hams, 
and turn them every two or three days in the pickle 
for three ^eeks. 'then hang them up in a chkaney^ 
and smoke them well a day or two with horse litter. 
Afterwards let them hang about a week on the side of 
the kitchen chimney, and then take them down. Keep 
them dry in a large box, and cover them well with 
bran. They will keep good in this state for a year, 
though if wanted, may be used in a month. 

Bacon. 
Take off all the inside fat of a side of pork, and lay 
it on a long board or dresser, that the blood may run 



804 CURING* 

fiom it Rub it well on both sides with goodsalt, and 
let it lie a day. Then take a pint of bay-salt, a quar* 
ter of a pound of saltpetre, and beat them both fine ; 
two pounds of coarse sugar, and a quarter of a peck of 
common salt. Lay your pork in something that will 
hold the pickle, and rub it well with the above ingre- 
dients. Lay the skinny side downwards, and baste it 
every day with a pickle for a fortnight. Then hang 
it in a wood-smoke, and afterwards in a dry but not 
hot place. Remember that all hams and bacons should 
hang clear from every thing, and not touch the wall. 
Take care to wipe off the old salt before you put it into 
the pickle, and never keep bacon or hams in a hot 
kitchen, or in a room exposed to the rays of the sun, as 
all these matters will greatly contribute to make them 
rusty. 

Mutton Hams. 
Take a hind quarter of mutton, cut it like a ham, 
and rub it well with an ounce of saltpetre, a pound of 
coarse sugar, and a pound of common salt, mixed well 
together. Lay it in a deepish tray with the skin down«- 
ward, and baste it with the pickle every day for a fort* 
night. Then roU it in sawdust, and hang it in a wood- 
smoke for a fortnight. Then boil it, and hang it up in 
a dry place. You may dress it whole, or cut slices off, 
and broil them, which will eat well, and have an ex- 
cellent flavour. 

Beef Hams. 

Cut the leg of a fat Scotch or Welch ox as nearly 
in the shape of a ham as yoi} can. Take an ounce of 
bay-salt, an ounce of saltpetre, a pound of common salt, 
and a pound of coarse sugar, which will be a sufficient 
quantity for about fourteen or fifteen pounds of beef; 
and if a greater or less quantity of meat, mix your 
ingredients in proportion. Pound these ingredients, 
mix them well together, rub your meat with it, turn it 
every day, and at the same time baste it well with the 
pickle. Let it lie in this state for a month, then take 
It out, roll it in bran or sawdust, and hang it in a wood- 
smoke for a month. Then take it down, hang it in a 



CURIMQ. 306 

dry pliBice, and keep it for use. You may dress it in 
whatever manner yoq please, and as occasion may re- 
quire. If you boil a piece of it, and let it be till it is 
cold, it will eat very good, and shives like Dutch beef; 
or it is exceeding fine cut into rashers and broiled, 
with poached eggs laid on the tops. 

JSTeafs Tongue. 

Scrape your tongue clean, dry it well with a cloth, 
and then salt it with common salt, and half an ounce 
of saltpetre well mixed together. Lay it in a deep 
pan, and turn it every day for a week or ten days. 
Then turn it again, and let it lay a week longer. Take 
it out of the pan, dry it with a cloth, strew flour on it, 
and hang it up in a moderate warm place to dry. 

Hurig Beef. 

Make a strong brine with bay-salt, saltpetre, and 
pump- water ; put a rib of beef into it, and let it lay 
for nine days. Then hang it up a chimney where' 
wood or sawdust is burnt. When it is a little dry, 
wash the outside with buUock^s blood ti/v^o or three 
times, to make it look black ; and when it is dry enough 
boil it, and serve it up with such kind of vegetables as 
you think proper. 

Another method of preparing hung beef is this : take 
the navel-piece, and hang it up in your cellar as long 
as it will keep good, and till it begins to be a little 
sappy ; then take it down, cut it into three pieces, and 
wash it in sugar and water, one piece after another. 
Then take a pound of saltpetre, and two pounds of 
bay-salt, dried and pounded small. Mix with them 
two or three spoonsful of brown sugar, and rub your 
beef well with it in every place. Then strew a suf- 
ficient quantity of common salt all over it, and let the 
beef lie close till the salt is dissolved, which will be in 
six or seven days. Then turn it every other day for a 
fortnight, and after that hang it up in a warm but not 
hot place. It may hang a fortnight in the kitch^^: 
and when you want it, boil it in bay-salt and pump^ 
water till it is tender. It will keep when boiled, two

or three montlui, robbing it with a greasy doth, or 
patting it two or three minutes into boiling water to 
take off the mouldiness. 

Dutch Beef. 

Take a buttock of beef, cutoff all the fat, and rub 
the lean all over with brown sugar. Let it lie two or 
three hours in a pan or tray, and turn it two or 
three times. Then salt it with saltpetre and common 
salt, and let it lay a fortnight, turning it every day. 
After the expiration of this time, roll it very straight 
in a coarse cloth, put it into a cheese-press tor a day 
and a night, and then hang it to dry in a chimney. 
When you boil it put it into a cloth, and when. cold, 
it will cut like Dutch beef. 

Hunting Beef. 

Take a pound of salt, two ounces of saltpetre, a 
quarter of a pound of brown sugar, one ounce of cori- 
anders, one ounce of cloves, half an ounce of mace, 
half an ounce of nutmeg, two ounces of allspice, a qusur- 
ter of a pound of pepper, half an ounce ol chyan pep- 
per, and two ounces of ginger ; let the whole he ground 
and well mixed. Take your buttock of beef and rub 
it well with the spices, and keep turnin| and rubbing 
it every day, one month : when your beef is to be done, 
take a deep pan, put in your beef with plenty of fat 
over and under, taking care that your beef does not 
touch the bottom of the pan. Cover your pan down 
close so that the steam does not come out, which may 
be prevented by putting a paste to the cover made of 
flour and water. Send it to the oven, and if moderate 
it will be done enough in five hours. It should not be 
taken out of your pan till quite cold ; be sure to have 
plenty of fat, as there must not be any water put in. 

Pickled Pork. 

Bone your pork, and then cut it into pieces of a 
stase suitable to lay in the pan in which you intend to 
pat it. Rub your pieces first with saltpetre, and thea 
with two pounds of common salt, and two of bay-salt^ 



SOUSING. SO? 

mixed Ix^ther. Put a layer of common salt at the 
bottom 01 your pan or tub, cover every piece over with 
common salt, and lay them one upon another as even 
as you can, filling the hollow places on the sides with 
salt As your salt melts on the top, strew on more, 
lay a coarse cloth over the vessel, a board over that, 
and a weight on the board to keep it down. Cover it 
close, strew on more salt as may be occasionally 
necessary, and it wHl keep good till the very last bit. 

Mock Bravm. 

Take the head, and a piece of the belly-part of a 
young porker, and rub them well with saltpetre. Let 
them lay three days, and then wash them clean. Split 
the head and boil it, take out the bones, and cut it into 
pieces. Then take four cow-heels boiled tender, cut 
them in thin pieces, and lay them in the belly-piece 
of pork, with the head cut small. Then roU it up 
tight with sheet-tin, and, boil it four or five hours. 
When it comes put, set it up on one end, put a 
trencher on it within the tin, press it down with a lai^e 
weight, and let it stand all night. Next morning take 
it out of the tin» and bind it with a fillet. Put it into 
cold salt and water, and it will be fit for use. If you 
change the salt and water every four days, it will keep 
for a long time. 

Turkey soused in Imitation of Sturgeon. 

Dress a fine Isirge turkey, dry and bone it, then 
tie it up as you do a sturgeon, and put it into the pot, 
with a quart of white wine, a quart of water, the same 
quantity of good vinegar, and a large handfiil of salt ; 
but remember that the wine, water, and vinegar, must 
boil before you put in the turkey, and that the pot 
must be well skimmed before it boils. When it is 
enough, take it out, and tie it tighter ; but let the 
liquor boil a little longer. If you think the pickle 
wants more vinegar or salt, add them when it is 
cold, and pour it upon the turkey. If you keep it 
covered close from the air, and in a cool dry place, it 



A^

will be equally good for some months. Some admire it 
more than stargeon, and it is generally eaten with oil, 
vinegar, and sugar, for sance. 

To make fine Sausages. 

Take six pounds of young pork, free from skin, 
gristles, and fat. Cut it very small, and beat it in a 
mortar till it is very fine. Then shred six pounds of 
beef-suet very fine, and firee from all skin. Take a 
good deal of sage, wash it very clean, pick off the 
leaves, and shred it fine. Spread your meat on a dean 
dresser or table, and then shake the sage all over it, 
to the quantity of about three large spoonsful. Shred 
the thin rind of a middling lemon very fine, and throw 
them over the meat, and also as many sweet herbs as, 
when shred fine, will fill a large spoon. Grate over it 
two nutmegs, and put to it two tea-spoonsful of pep- 
per, and a large spoonful of salt. Thlen throw over it 
the suet, and mix all well together. Put it down close 
in a pot, and when you use it, roll it up with as much 
egg as will make it roll smooth. Make them of the 
size of a sausage, and fry them m butter, or good drip- 
ping. Be careful the butter is hot before you put them 
in, and keep rolling them about while they are doing. 
When they are thoroughly hot, and of a fine light 
brown, take them out, put them into a dish, and serve 
them up. Veal mixed with pork, and done in this man- 
ner, eats exceeding fine. 

Oxford Sausages. 

Take a pound of young pork, fat and lean, with- 
out skin or gristle, a pound of lean veal, and a pound 
of beef-suet, chopped all fine together ; put in half a 
pound of grated bread, half the peel of a lemon shred 
fine, a nutmeg grated,^ six sage-leaves washed and 
chopped very fine, a tea-spoonful of pepper and two 
of salt, some thyme, savory, and marjorum, shred fine. 
Mix all well together, and put it close down in a pan 
till you use it. Roll it out the size of a common sau- 
sage, and fiy them in fi-esh butter of a fine brown, or 
broil them over a clear fire, and send them to table as 
hot as possible.

CHAPTER XXV, 

METHODS OF KEEPING VEGETABLES, FRUITS, ^C. 

To keep Green Peas till Christmas. 

PEAS for this purpose must be chosen very fine, 
young and firesh gathered. Shell them, and put 
them into boiling water with some salt in it. When 
they have boiled five or six minutes, tlurow them into 
a cullender to drain. Then lay a cloth four or five 
times double on a table, and spread them on it. Dry 
them well, and having your bottles ready, fill them 
and cover them with mutton-fat fried. Cork them as 
close as possible, tie a bladder over them, and set 
them in a cool place. When you use them, boil the 
water, put in a little salt, some sugar, and a piece of 
butter. As soon as they are enough, throw them into 
a sieve to drain ; then put them into a saucepan with 
a good piece of butter, keep shaking it round till the 
butter is all melted, then turn them into a dish, and 
send them to table. 

To keep Gooseberries. 

Put an ounce of roche-alum, beat very fine, into a 
large pan of boiling hard water. When you have 
picked your gooseberries, put a few of them into the 
bottom of a hair sieve, and hold them in the boiling 
water till they turn white. Then take out the sieve, 
and spread the gooseberries between two clean cloths. 
Put more gooseberries in your sieve, and then repeat 
it till they are donef Put the water into a glazed pot 
till next day ; then put your gooseberries into wide- 
mouthed bottles, pick out all the cracked and broken 
ones, pour the water clear out of the pot, and fill your 
bottles with it. Then cork them loosely, and let them 
stand a fortnight. If they rise to the corks, draw them 
out, and let them stand two or three days uncorked. 
Then cork them quite close, and they will keep good 
several months. 

Another method of keeping gooseberries is this : 
Pick them as large and dry as you can, and having 



310 FRUItS, <$*c. 

taken care that your bottles are clean and dry, fill and 
cork them. Set them in a kettle of water np to the 
neck, and let the water boil very slowly till you find 
the gooseberries are coddled ; then take them out, and 
put in the rest of the bottles till all are done. Have 
ready some rosin melted in a pipkin, and dip the necks 
of the bottles into it, which will prevent all air firom 
getting in at the cork. Keep them in a cool dry place, 
and when yon use them they will bake as red as a 
cherry, and have their natural flavour. 

To keep Mushrooms. 
Take large buttons, wash them in the same man- 
ner as for stewing, and lay them on sieves with the 
stalks upwards. Throw over them some salt, to draw 
out the water. When they are properly drained, put 
them into a pot, and set them in a cool oven for an 
hour. Then take them out carefully, and lay them to 
cool and drain. Boil the liquor that comes out of them 
with a blade or two of mace, and boil it half away. 
Put your mushrooms into a clean jar well dried, and 
when the liquor is cold, pour it into the jar, and cover 
your mushrooms with it. Then pour over them ren- 
dered suet ; tie a bladder over the jar, and set them 
in a dry closet, where they will keep very well the 
greater part of the winter. When you use them, take 
them out of the liquor, pour over them boiling milk, 
and let them stand an hour. Then stew them in the 
milk a quarter of an hour, thicken them with flour, and 
a large quantity of butter ; but be careful you do not 
oil it. Then beat the yolks of two eggs in a little 
cream, and put it into the stew ; but do not let it boil 
after you have put in the eggs. Lay unroasted sippets 
round the inside of the dish, then serve them up, and 
they will eat nearly as good as when firesh gathered. 
If they do not taste strong enough, put in a little of 
the liquor. This is a very useful liquor, as it will give 
a strong flavour of fi'esh mushrooms to ail made dishes. 

To Bottle Damsons. 
Take your damsons before they are too ripe, put 



Cossets, ^c. 311 

th^m into wide-monthed bottled, and cotk them dowa 
tight ; then put them into a moderate oven, and about 
t^-ee hours will do them. You must be careful yotit 
oven is not too hot, or it will make your fruit fl j. All 
kinds of fruits that are bottled may be done in the same 
way, and if well done will keep two years. After they 
are done they must be put away, with the mouth down* 
wahl, in a cool place, to keep them fit>m fermenting. - 
•^* Remember, that every species of the vegetaUe 
tribe designed for future use, at times out of the natund 
season, must be kept in dry places, as damps will not 
only cover them with mould, but will also deprive them 
of their fine flavour. It must likewise be observed, 
that while you endeavour to avoid putting them into 
damp places, you do not place them where they may 
get warm, which will be equally detrimental ; so that A 
proper attention must be paid to the observance of a ju- 
dicious medium. When you boil any dried vegetaUes, 
always allow them plenty of water. ^ 



CHAPTER XXYI. 

POSSETS, GRUELS, l^c. 

Sack Possets. 

BEAT up the yolks and whites of fifteen eggs, and 
then strain them ; then put three quarters of a pound 
of white sugar into a pint of canary, and mix it with 
your eggs in a basin ; set it over a chafing-dish of 
coals, and keep continually stirring it till it is scalding 
hot. In the mean time grate some nutmeg in a quart 
of milk, and boil it, and then pour it into your eggs, 
and wine while they are scalding hot. As you pour it 
hold your hand very high, and let another person keep 
stirring it all the time. Then take it off, set it before 
the fire half an hour, and serve it up. 

Another method of making sack-posset is this : take 
four Naples biscuits, and crumble them into a quart of 
new milk when it boils. Just give it a boil, take it 
off, grate in some nutmegs, and sweeten it to your 



312 possfiTSi 4^c. 

palate. Then pour in half a pint of sack, keep stir- 
ring it all the time, put it into your basin, and send it 
to table. 

Wine Posset. 

Boil the crumb of a penny loaf in a quart of milk 
till it is soft, then take it off tiie fire, and grate in half 
a nutmeg. Put in sugar to your taste, then pour it 
into a china bowl, and put in by degrees a pint of 
Lisbon wine. Serve it up with toasted bread upcm a 
plate. 

Ale Posset. 

Take a small piece of white bread, put it into a 
pint of milk, and set it over the fire. Then put some 
nutmeg and sugar into a pint of ale, warm it, and 
when your milk boils, pour it upon the ale. Let it 
stand a few minutes to clear, and it will be fit for use. 

Orange Posset. 
Take the crumb of a penny loaf grated fine, and 
put it into a pint of water, with haJf the peel of a 
Seville orange grated, or sugar rubbed upon it to take 
out the essence. Boil all tc^ether till it looks thick and 
clear. Then take a pint of mountain wine, the juice 
of half a Seville orange, three ounces of sweet almonds, 
and one of bitter, beat fine, with a little French bran- 
dy, and sugar to your taste. Mix all well together, 
put it into your posset, and serve it up. Lemon pos- 
set must be made in the same manner. 

White Caudle. 

Take two quarts of water, and mix it with four 
spoonsful of oatmeal, a blade or two of mace, and a 
piece of lemon-peel. Let it boil, and keep stirring it 
often. Let it boil a quarter of an hour, and be care- 
ful not to let it boil over, then strain it through a coarse 
sieve. When you use it sweeten it to your taste, grate 
in a little nutmeg, and what wine you think proper ; 
and if it is not for a sick person, squeeze in the juice 
of a lemon. 

Brown Caudle. 

Mix your gruel as for the white caudle; and wheu 



GRUBLS^ 4^C. 313 

you have strained it» add a quart of ale that is not 
bitter. Boil it, then sweeten it to your palate, and 
add half a pint of white wine or brandy. When you 
do not put in white wine or brandy, let it be half ale. 

•• 

White Wine Whey. 

Put in a large basin half a pint of skimmed milk 
and half a pint of wine. When it has stood a few mi- 
nutes, pour in a pint of boiling water. Let it stand a 
little, and the curd will gather in a lump, and settle at 
the bottom. Then pour your whey into a china bowl, 
and put in a lump of sugar, a sprig of balm, or a sUce 
of lemon. 

Water Gruel. 

Put a large spoonful of oatmeal into a pint of water, 
and stir it well together, and let it boil three or four 
times, stirring it often ; but be careful it does not boil 
over. Then strain it through a sieve, salt it to your 
palate, and put in a good piece of butter. Stir it about 
with a spoon till the butter is all melted, and it will bo ^ 
fine and smooth. 

Barley Ch^uel. 

Put a quarter of a pound of pearl-barley, and a 
fitick of cinnamon, into two quarts of water, and let 
it boil till it is reduced to one quart. Then strain it 
through a sieve, add a pint of red wine, and swQeten 
it to your taste* 

Orgeat Paste. 

Take three quarters of a pound of sweet almonds, 
and a quarter of a pound of bitter almonds, blanch and 
pound them in your mortar, wetting them from time 
to time with orange-flower water that they may not oil. 
When they are pounded very fine, add three quarters 
of a pound of fine pounded sugar to it, and mix the 
whole into a stiff paste, and then put it into your pots 
for use. This paste will keep six months. When yon 
wish to use it, you may take a piece about the sisse of 
an egg and mix it with half a pint of water, and squeessa 
it through a fine napkin.

CHAPTER XXVII. 

MADE WIJ^ES, ^c. 

A STRICT and attentive management in the making 
of these articles is the grand means by which they are 
to be brought to a proper state of perfection ; and with- 
out whichy labour, expense, and disrepute, will be 
the final, and disagreeable consequences. To prevent 
the last, and promote the fii-st, let a due observance be 
paid to the following general rules : do not let such 
wines as require to be made with boiling water stand 
too long after drawn, before you get them cold, and be 
careful to put in your barm in due time, otherwise it 
will fret atier being put into the cask, and can never 
be brought to that state of fineness it ought to be. 
Neither must you let it work too long in the butt, as 
it will be apt to take off the sweetness and flavour of 
the firuit or flowers fi-om which it is made. Let your 
vessels be thoroughly clean and dry, and before you 
put in the wine, give them a rince with a little brandy. 
When the wine has done fermenting, bimg it up close, 
and after being properly settled, it will draw to yoor 
wishes. 

Raisin Wine. 

Put two hundred weight of raisins, with all their 
stalks into a large hogshead, and fill it up with water. 
Let them steep a fortnight, stirring them every day. 
Then pour off" the liquor, and press the raisins. Pat 
both liquors together into a nice clean vessel that will 
just hold it, for remember, it must be quite full. Let 
it stand till it is done hissing, or making the least noise^ 
then stop it close, and let it stand six^ months. Then 
peg it, and if quite clear, rack it off into another ves- 
sel. Stop it again close, and let it stand three months 
longer. Then bottle it» and when wanted, rack it off 
into a decanter. 

An excellent Wine from Smyrna Currants. 
To every gallon of water put two pounds and three 
quarters of brown sugar, and one pound and a half of 



HAD£ WINES* S16 

Smyrna currants. Boil the sugar and water for half 
an hour, and fine it with whites of eggs ; when near 
cold, put some fresh barm to it, and let it stand in the 
tub seven or eight days, stirring it once a day. Cut 
your currants a little with a chopping knife, then put 
them into a barrel, and pour the wine on them. Have 
ready some isinglass dissolved in a little of the wine, 
and put it into the barrels, stirring it every day for six 
or eight weeks, then close it up, and in about nine 
months it will be ready to bottle. 

Currant Wine. 

Gather your fruit on a fine dry day, and when 
they are quite ripe. .. Strip them from the stalks, pat 
them into a large pan, and bruise them with a wooden 
pestle. Let them lay twenty-four hours to ferment, then 
run the hquor through a hair sieve, but do not let your 
hands touch it. To every gallon of liquor put two 
pounds and a half of white sugar, stir it well together, 
and put it into your vessel. To every six gallons put 
in a quart of brandy, and let it stand six weeks. If it 
is then fine, bottle it ; but if not, draw it off as clear as 
you can into another vessel, or large bottles, and in a 
fortnight put it into smaller bottles, cork them close, 
and set it by for use. 

Gooseberry Wine. 

Gathee your gooseljerries in dry weather, and at 
the time when they are about half ripe. Gather about 
a peck in quantity, and bruise them well in a clean tub. 
Then take a horse-hair cloth, and press them as much 
as possible without breaking the seeds. When you 
have squeezed out all the juice, put to every gallon 
three pounds of fine dry pounded sugar. Stir it all 
together till the sugar is dissolved, and then put it into 
a vessel or cask, which must be quite filled. If the 
quantity is ten or twelve gallons, let it stand a fortnight, 
but, if it is a twenty gallon cask, it must stand three 
weeks. Set it in a cool place ; then draw it off from 
the lees, and poui* in the clear liquor again. If it is a 



S16 UAVt WIK&IS. 

ten gallon cask, let it stand three months ; if a twenty 
gallon cask, four mouths ; then bottle it off, and it wiU 
draw clear and fine. 

Mulberry Wine. 

Gather your mulberries when they are in the 
state of changing from red to black, and at that time of 
the day when they are dry from the dew having been 
taken off by the heat of the sun. Spread them loose 
on a cloth, or a clean floor, and let them lay twenty-' 
four hours. Then put them into a convenient vessel 
for the purpose, squeeze out all the juice, and drain it 
from the seeds. Boil up a gallon of water to each 
gallon of juice you get out of tliem ; then skim the 
water well, and add a little cinnamon slightly bruised. 
Pot to each gallon six ounces of white sugar-candy 
finely beaten. Skim and strain the water, when it has 
been taked off, and is settled ; and put to it some 
more juice of the mulberries. To every gallon of the 
liquor, add a pint of white or rhenish wine. Let it 
stand in a x^asK to purge or settle for five or six days, 
and then draw off the wine, and keep it in a cool place. 

Raspberry Wine. 

Pick some of the finest raspberries you can getf 
bruise them, and strain them through a flannel bag into 
a stone jar. To each quart of juice put a pound of 
double-refined sugar, then stir it well together, and 
cover it close. Let it stand three days, and then pour 
it off clear. To a quart of juice put two pints of 
white wine, and then bottle it off. In the course of a 
week it will be fit for use. 

Damsom Wine. 

After you have gathered your damsons, which 
must be on a dry day, weigh them and then bruise 
them. Put them into a stein that has a tap in it, and 
to every eight pounds of fruit put a gallon of water. 
Boil the water, skim it, and pour it scalding hot on 
your fruit. When it has stood two days draw it off, 



MADE WINES. S17 

imd pnt it into a vessel, and to every gallon of liquor 
put two pounds and a half of fine sugar. Fill up the 
vessel and stop it close, and the longer it stands the 
better. When you draw it off, put a lump of sugar 
into every bottle. 

Orange Wine. 

Boil six gallons of spring water three quarters of 
an hour, with twelve pounds of the best powder sugar, 
and the whites of eight or ten eggs well beaten. When 
it is cold, put it in six spoonsful of yeast. Take the juice 
of twelve lemons, which, being pared, must stand 
with about two pounds of white sugar in a tankard, 
and in the morning skim off the top, and put it in the 
water. Then add the juice and rinds of fifty oranges, 
but not the white parts of the rinds, and then let them 
work all together for forty-eight Lours. Then add two 
quarts of Rhenish or white wine, and put it into your 
vessel. 

Orange wine may be made with raisins, in which 
case proceed thus : take thirty pounds of new Malaga 
raisins picked clean, chop them small, and take twenty 
large Seville oranges, ten of which you must prepare 
as thin as for preserving. Boil about eight gallons of 
soft water till one third of it is wasted, and let it cool 
a little. Then put five gallons of it hot upon your 
raisins and orange-peel, stir it well together, cover it 
up, and when it is cold, let it stand five days, stirring 
it once or twice a day. Then pass it through a hair 
sieve, and with a spoon press it as dry as you can 
Put it in a rundlet fit for use, and put to it the rinds 
of the other ten oranges, cut as thin as the first. Then 
make a syrap of the juice of twenty oranges, with a 
pound of white sugar, which must be done the day 
before you tun the wine. Stir it well together, and 
stop it close. Let it stand two months to clear, and 
then bottle it off. This wine greatly improves by time, 
and will drink much better at the end of the third year 
than the first. 

Lemon Wine. 
Pare off the rinds of six large lemons, cut them, 



318 HADE WINES. 

and squeeze out the juice. Steep the rmds in the juice, 
and put to it a quart of brandy. Let it stand three 
days in an earthen pot close stopped ; then squeeze six 
more, and mix it with two quarts of spring water, and 
as much sugar as will sweeten the whole. Boil the 
water, lemons, and sugar together, and let it stand till 
it is cool. Then add a quart of white wine, mix them 
together, and run it through a flannel bag into some 
vessel. Let it stand three months, and then bottle it 
off. Cork your bottles well, keep it cool, and it will 
be fit to drink in a month or six weeks. 

Lemon wine may be made to drink Uke citron wa- 
ter, the method of which is as foUows : pare fine a 
dozen of lemons very thin, put the peels into five quarts 
of French brandy, and let them stand fonrteea days. 
Then make the juice into a syrup with three pounds 
of single-refined sugar, and when the peels areVeady, 
boQ fiOeen gallons of water with forty pounds of single- 
refined sugar for half an hour. Then put it into a tub, 
and when cool, add to it one spoonfiil of barm, and let 
it work two days. Then turn it, and put in the bran- 
dy, peels, and syrup. Stir them altogether, and close 
up your cask. Let it stand three months, then bottle 
it, and it will be as pale and fine as any citron water. 

Qrape Wine. 

Put a gallon of water to a gallon of grapes. Bruise 
the grapes well, let them stand a week without stir- 
ring, and then draw off the liquor. Put to a gallon 
of the wine three pounds of sugar, and then put it into 
a vessel, but do not fasten it up with your bung till it 
has done hissing. Let it stand two months, and it will 
draw clear and fine. If you think proper you may 
then bottle it, but remember your cork is quite close, 
and keep it in a good dry cellar. 

Cherry Wine. 

Gather your cherries when they are quite ripe, 
pull them fi'om the stalks, and press them through a 
hair-sieve. To every gallon of liquor put two pounds 



MADE WINES. 319 

of Itunp sogar finely beaten, then stir it together, and 
put it into a vessel that will just contain it. When it 
has done working, and ceases to make any noise, stop 
it very close for three months, and tlien bottle it off for 
use. 

Elder Wine. 

Pick your elder-berries when they are M ripe, put 
them into a stone jar, and set them in the oven, or in 
a kettle of boiling water till the jar is hot through ; then 
take them out, and strain them through a coarse sieve, 
wringing the berries, and put the juice into a clean ket- 
tle. To every quart of juice, put a pound of fine Lis- 
bon sugar, let it boil, and skim it well. When it is 
dear and fine, pour it into a cask. To every ten gal- 
lons of wine, add an ounce of isinglass dissolved in 
cider, and six whole eggs. Close it up, let it stand six 
months, and then bottle it. 

Apricot Wine. 

Put three pounds of sugar into three quarts of wa- 
ter, let them boil together, and skim it well. Then 
put in six pounds of apricots pared and stoned, and let 
them boil till they are tender. Take out the apricots, 
and when the liquor is cold, bottle it up. For present 
use the apricots will make good marmalade. 

QfAiru:e Wine. 

Gather twenty large quinces, when they are dry 
and full ripe. Wipe them clean with a coarse cloth, 
and grate them with a large grate or rasp as near the 
cores as you can ; but do not touch the cores. Boil a 
gallon of spring- water, throw in your quince and let 
them boil softly about a quarter of an hour. Then 
strain them well into an earthen pan on two pounds 
of double-refined sugar. Pare the peel of two large 
lemons, throw them in, and squeeze the juice through 
a sieve. Stir it about till it is very cold, and then 
toast a thin slice of bread very brown, rub a little yeast 
on it, and let the whole stand close covered twenty- 
four hours. Then take out the toast and lemon, pat

the wine in a cask» keep it three months, and then bot- 
tle it. If you make a twenty gallon cask, let it stand 
six months before you bottle it ; and remember, when 
you strain your quinces, to wring them hard in a coarse 
cloth. 

Blackberry Wine. 

Le t your berries be full ripe when you gather them 
for this purpose. Put them into a large vessel either 
of wood or stone, with a tap in it, and pour upon them 
as much boiling water as will cover them. As soon as 
the heat will permit you to put your hand into the ves- 
sel, bruise them well till all the berries are broken. 
Then let them stand covered till the berries begin to 
rise towards the top, which they will do in three or 
four days. Then draw off the clear into another ves- 
sel, and add to every ten quarts of this liquor one 
pound of sugar. Stir it well in, and let it stand to 
work a week or ten days in another vessel like the first. 
Then draw it off at the cork through a jelly-bag into a 
large vessel. ' Take four ounces of isinglass, and lay it 
to steep twelve hours in a pint of white wine. The 
next morning boil it upon a slow fire till it is all dis- 
solved. Then take a gallon of your blackberry juice, 
put in the dissolved isinglass, give them a boil tc^ther^ 
and pour all into the vessel. Let it stand a few days 
to purge and settle, then draw it off, and keep it in a 

cool place. 

• 

Turnip Wine. 

Take what quantity of turnips you think proper, 
pare and slice them, put them into a cider-press, and 
squeeze out all the juice. To every gallon of juice put 
three pounds of lump sugar, put both into a vessel just 
large enough to hold them, and add to every gallon of 
juice half a pint of brandy. Lay something over the 
bung for a week ; and when you ai*e sure it has done 
working, bung it down close. Let it stand three 
months, then draw it off into another vessel, and wh^i 
it is fine, put it into bottles. 






MADE WINES 321 

Birch Wine. 

This wine must be made at that time of the year 
when the liqaor firom the birch- trees can.be best pro- 
cured. This is in the beginning of March, when the 
sap is rising, and before the leaves shoot out ; finr when 
the sap is coming forward, and the leaves appear, the 
juice, by being long digested in the bark, grows thick 
and coloured, which before was thin and clear. The 
method of procuring the juice is, by boring holes in the 
body of the tree, and putting fbssets, which are usual- 
ly made of the branches of elder, the pith being taken 
out. You may, without hurting the tree, if it is large, 
tap it in several places, four or five at a time, and by 
that means save, from a good many trees, several gal- 
lons every day. If you do not get enough in one day, 
the bottles in which it drops must be corked close, and 
rosined or waxed ; however, make use of it as soon as 
you can. Take the sap, and boil it as long as any 
scum will rise, skimming it all the time. To every 
gallon of liquor put four pounds of good sugar and the 
thin peel of a lemon. Then boil it half an hour, and 
keep skimming it well. Pour it into a clean tub, and 
when it is almost cold, set it to work with yeast spread 
upon a toast. Let it stand five or six days, stirring it 
often. Then take a cask just large enough to hold all 
the liquor, fire a large match dipped in brimstone, and 
throw it into the cask, stop it dose till the match is 
extinguished, then turn your wine, and lay the bung 
on li^tly till you fimd it has done working. Stop it 
dose, and, afler three months, bottle it off. 

Rose Wine. 

Put into a well-glazed earthen vessel three gallons 
of rose-water drawn with a cold still. Put into it a 
sufficient quantity of rose-leaves, cover it close, and set 
it for an hour iii a kettle or copper of hot water, to 
to take out the whole strength and flavour of the roses. 
When it is cold, press the rose-lea\rs hard into the 
kquor, and steep fresh ones on it, repeating it till the 
liquor has got the fuU strength of the roses. To every

gallon of liquor pat three pounds of loaf sagar, and stir 
it well that it may melt and disperse in every part 
Then put it into a cask, or other convenient vessel, to 
ferment, and throw into it a piece of bread toasted 
hard and covered with yeast Let it stand a month, 
when it will be ripe, and have all the fine flavour and 
scent of the roses. If you add some wine and spices, 
it will be a considerable improvement By the same 
mode of infusion, wines may be made from any other 
flowers that have an odoriferous scent, and grateful 
flavour. 

Qinger Wine. 

Put seven pounds of Lisbon sugar into four gallons 
of spring water, boil them a quarter of an hour, and 
keep skimming it all the time. When the liquor is 
cold, squeeze in the juice of two lemons, and then boil 
the peels with two ounces of ginger, in three pints of 
water, for an hour. When it is cold, put it all toge- 
ther into a barrel, with two spoonsful of^yeast, a quar* 
ter of an ounce of isinglass beat very thin, and two 
pounds of jar raisins. Then close it up, let it stand 
seven wedcs, and then bottle it off. 

Balm Wine. 

Boil forty pounds of sugar in nine gallons of water 
for two hours, skim it well, and put it into a tub to cooL 
Take two pounds and a half of the tops of balm, bruise 
them, and put them into a barrel with a litfle new 

Sast, and when the liquor is cold, pour it on the balm. 
ix it well together, and let it stand twenty-focur. 
hours, stirring it frequently during the time. Then 
close it up, and let it stand six weeks, at the expira- 
tion of whidi rack it off, and put a lump of sugar mto 
every bottle. Cork it weH, and it will be better the 
seeond year than the first. 

Mead JVine. 

Thbrs are different kinds of this wine ; but those 
generally made are two, namely, sack-mead and cow- 
dip-mead. Sac^ mead is made thus : to everj gaUon 



of water put four pounds of hon^» and boil it three 
quarters of an hour, taking care pfoperiy to skim it 
To each gaUon add half an ounce of hops, then boil 
it half an hour, and let it stand till the next day« Then 
put it into your cask ; and to thirteen gallons of the 
liquor add a quart of brandy or sack. Let it be tightly 
closed till the fermentation is over, and then stop it 
up very dose. If you make as much as fills a large 
cask, you must not bottle it off till it has stood a year. 
To make cowslip-mead you must proceed thus : put 
thirty pounds of honey into fifteen gallons of water,, 
and boil it till one gaUon is wasted ; skim it, take it 
off the fire,, and have ready sixteen lemons cut in 
half. Take a gallon of the liquor, and put it to the 
lemons. Pour the rest of the liquor into a tub, with 
seven pecks of cowslips, and let them stand all night : 
then put in the liquor with the lemons, eight spoonsful 
of new yeast, and a handful of sweet-brier ; stir all 
well together, and 1^ it work three or four days. 
Then strain it, pour it into your cask, let it stand six 
months, and then bottle it off for use. 

Raspberry Brandy. 

Mix a pint of water witii two quarts of brandy, 
and put them into a pitcher large enough to hold them, 
with four pints of raspberries. Put in half a pound of 
loaf-sugar, and let it remain for a week close covered. 
Then take a piece of flannel, with a piece of Holland 
over it, and let it run through by degrees. In about 
a week it will be perfectly fine, when you may rack it 
off; but be careful the bottles are well corked. 

Orange Brandy. 

Put into three quarts of brandy the chips of eigh- 
teen Seville oranges, and let them steep a fortnight in^ 
a stone bottle dose stopped. Boil two quarts of spring 
water, with a pound and a half of the finest sugar, 
near an hour very gently. Clarify the water and su« 
gar with the white of an egg^ then strain it through a 
jelly-bag, and boil it near half away. When it is cold^ 
strain the brandy into the syrup.

Lemon Brandy. 

Mix fire quarts of water with one gallon c^ farandy ; 
then take two doeen of lemons, two potmds of the best 
sugar, and three pints of milk. Pare the lemons very 
thin, and lay the peel to steep in the brandy twelve 
hours. Squeeze the lemons upon the sugar, then put 
the water to it, and mix all the ingredients together. 
Let it stand twenty*four hours, and then strain it. 

Black Cherry Brandy. 

Btone eight pounds of black cherries, and put on 
them a gallon of the best brandy. Bruise the stones 
in a mortar, and then put them into your brandy. Co- 
ver them up close, and let them stand a month or sbk 
weeks. Then pour it dear firom the sediments^ and 
bottle it Morello cherries managed in this manner,

CORDIAL WATERS. 

IN the process of making these articles, several 
things are necessary to be observed, in otder to bring 
them to their proper state of perfection. If your still 
is an alembic, you must fill the top with cold water 
when you set it on, and close the bottom with a little 
stifi* paste made of flour and water. If you use a hot 
still, when you put on the top, dip a cloth in white 
lead and oil, and lay it close over the ends, and a coarse 
cloth well soaked in water on the top ; and when it 
becomes dry fix)m the heat of the fire, wet it and lay it 
on again. It will require but little fire, but what there 
is must be as clear as possible. All simple waters 
must stand two or three dajrs before they are bottled 
off, that the fiery taste which they will naturally receive 
from the still may be fully extracted. 

Rose Water. 
Gather your roses wh^i they are dry and full 
blown, pick off the leaves, and to every peck put a 



CORDIAL WATERS. S2d 

qoart of water. Then put them into a cold Mill, and 
make a slow fire under it ; for the more gradually it is 
distilled, the better it will be. Then bottle it> and in 
two or three days you may cork it up for use. 

Lavender Water. 

To every pound of lavender-neps put a quart of 
water. Put them into a cold stilly and make a slow 
fire under it. Distil it off very slowly, and put it into 
a pot till you have distilled all your water. Then 
dean your still well out, put your lavender-water into 
it, and distil it off as slowly as before. Then put it 
into bottles, cork them quite dose, and set them by for 
use. 

Peppermint Water. 

Gather your peppermint when it is foil grown, 
and before it seeds. Cut it into short lengths, put it 
into your still, and cover it with water. Make a good 
fire under iU and when it is near boiling, and the still 
begins to drop, if you find your fire too hot, draw a 
litde away, that the liquor may not boil over. The 
slower your still drc^, the clearer and stronger will be 
the water ; but at the same time you must not let it 
get too weak. The next morning bottle it off, and 
after it has stood two or three days, to take off the 
fiery taste of the still, cork it Well, and it will preserve 
its strength a considerable time. 

Surfeit Water. 

Take scurvy-grass, brook-lime, water-cresses, Ra- 
man wormwood, rue, mint, balm, sage, and chives, of 
each one handful ; poppies, if fresh, half a peck ; but 
if they are dry, only half that quantity ; cochineal and 
saffron, six-penny worth of each : aniseeds, carraway*^ 
seeds, coriander-seeds, and cardamum seeds, of each 
an ounce ; two ounces of scraped liquorice, a pound 
of split figs, the same quantity of raisins of the sua 
stoned, an ounce of juniper-berries bruised, an ounce 
of beaten nutmeg, an ounce of mace bruised, and the 
isame of sweet fennel seeds also bruised ; a few flowers 



526 vRiwina. 

of rosemary, marigold, and sage. Pat all these into a 
large stone jar, and poor on them three gallons of 
French ][)randy. Cover it close, and let it stand near 
the fire for three weeks. Stir it three times a week, 
and at the expiration of that time strain it off. Bottle 
your liquor, and pour on the ingredients a quart more 
of French brandy. Let it stand a week, stirring it 
once a day ; then distil it in a cold still, and you will 
have a fine white surfeit water. Bottle it close, and it 
will retain its virtues a considerable time. 



CHAPTER XXIX. 

THE ART OF BREWING. 

TO complete the Housekeeper's knowledge in all 
domestic concerns, it is essentially necessary she should 
be properly acquainted with the method of brewing 
malt-liquors, more especially should she be the princi- 
pal provider for a numerous family. This business 
vnll therefore form the subject of the present chapter, 
and the mode to be pursued throughout the whQle pro- 
cess we shall endeavour to lay down in so clear, con- 
cise, and intelligent a manner, as may easily guide the 
uaacquainted, and perhaps, in some degree, be mate- 
rially beneficial to those already informed. 



SECT. L 

The Principlts on which a Copper should be built 

for Brewing. 

There are several things that demand peculiar no- 
tice previous to the actual process of brewing malt 
liquors ; and those are with respect to the various im- 
plements necessary to effect and facilitate a proper 
execution of so important a business. 

The first thing that presents itself among these is 
the copper, the proper position of which, and manner 
of its being set, are matters that require very attentive 



BREWING. 327 

consideralioii* The most beneficial mode to be adopt- 
ed is this: divide the heat of the fire by a stop ; andif 
the door and drai^ht be in a direct line, the stop most 
be erected firom the middle of each outline of the grat* 
ing, and parallel with the centre sides of the copper ; 
by. which method the middle of the fire will be direct* 
ly mider the bottom of the copper. The stop is com- 
posed of a thin wall in the centre of the right and left 
sides of the copper, which is to ascend half the height 
of it. On the top must be left a cavity, from four to six 
inches, for a draught for that half part of the fire which 
is next the door of the copper ; and then the building 
must dose ail round to the finishing at the top. By 
this method the heat will communicate from the out*- 
ward part of the fire round the outward half of your 
copper, through the cavity, as well the farthest part of 
the flue, which also contracts a conjunction of the 
whole, and causes the flame to glide gently and equally 
round the bottom of the copper. 

The advantages derived trom your coppev being set 
in this manner are very great, nor is the saving of fuel 
the least object of consideration among them. It has a 
material pre-eminence over wheel-drai^hts; fin* wilb 
them, if tixere is not particular attendance given to the 
hops, by stirring them down, they are apt to stick to 
the sides, and scorch, which will deprive the liquor of 
having its sweet and proper flavour. By the before 
mentioned method the copper will last maay years^ 
more than it will by the wheel-draught ; for that draws, 
with 80 much violence, that should your Ijquor be 
benieath the communication of the fire, your copper 
will thereby be liable to injury ; whereas by the other 
method, you may boU half a copper fuU without fear 
of any bad consequence.

and the necessity^ cf keeping them in due Order. 

On the preceding day that you intend to brew.

make a strict esuunination into all yonr. vetSKb, that 
they are thoroughly clean, and in a proper state for nae. 
They should never be converted to any other purpose, 
except for the use of making wines ; and, even in that 
case, after done with, should be properly cleansed, and 
kept in a, place free from dirt. Let your cask be wall 
cleaned with boiling water ; and if the bung-hole is 
large enough, scrub them well with a small birch- 
broom, or brush. If you find them bad, and a very 
musty scent comes from them, take out the heads, and 
let them be scrubbed clean with a hand brush, sand^ 
and fullers'-earth. When you have done this, pot on 
the head again, and scald it weU, then throw in a piece 
of unslacked lime, and stop the bung close. When 
they have stood some time, rince them well with cold 
water, and they will be properly prepared for use. 

The greatest attention must likewise be paid to the 
care of your coolers, which are implements of very ma- 
terial consequence ; for, if they are not properly kept 
in order, your liquor, from a secret and unaccountable 
cause, abstracts a nauseousness that will entirely de- 
stroy it. This often proceeds firom wet having been 
infused in the wood, as it is sometim^ apt to lodge in 
the crevices of old coolers, and even infect them to such 
a degree, that it will not depart, though many washings 
und scaldings are applied. One cause incidental to 
this evil is, suffering women to wash in a brewhouse, 
which ought by no means to be permitted, where any 
other convenience can be had ; for nothing can be more 
hurtful than the remnants of dirty soap suds left in 
vessels calculated only for the purpose of brewing. 

When you prepare the coolers, be careful never to 
let the water stand too long in them, as it will soak in,, 
and soon turn putrid, when the stench will enter the 
wood, and render them almost incurable. To prevent 
such consequences, as well as to answer good purposes, 
it has been recommended, where fixed brewhouses 
are intended, that all coolers should be leaded. It 
must be admitted, in the first place, that such are ex- 
ceeding cleanly ; and, secondly, that it expedites the 



BRKWIK6* S^d 

cooling part of your liquor worts, which is very neces^ 
sary to forward it for working, as well as afterwards 
for cooling the whole ; for evaporation causes consi- 
derably more waste than proper boiling. It is also 
indispensably necessary that your coolers be well scour- 
ed with cold water two or three times, cold water 
being more proper than hot to effect a perfect cleansing^ 
especially if they are in a bad condition, from undis" 
covered filth that may be in the crevices. The appli- 
cation of warm water will drive the infection farther ; 
so that if your liquor be let into the coolers, and any 
remain in the crevices, the heat will collect the foulnessi 
and render the whole both disagi-eeable and unwhole- 
some. 

The mash-tub in particular must be kept perfectly 
clean ; nor must the grains be left in the tub any long- 
er than the day after brewing, lest it should sour the 
tub ; for if there is a sour scent in the brewhouse before 
yom* beer is tunned, it will be apt to infect your liquor 
and worts. From such inconveniences, the necessity 
of cleanliness in utensils for brewing is sufficiently 
obvious. 



SECT. Ili- 

Directions for the Management of the Mash-tub f 

Penstc^, ^c. 

To render your mash-tub more perfect and lasting^ 
you should have a circular piece of brass or copper, to 
mlay and line the whole where the penstaff enters, to 
let the wort run off into the underback. The penstaff 
should be also strongly ferrelled with the same metal, 
and both well and taperly finished, so that you can place 
it properly. By this method you have it run firora 
the fineness of a thread to the fulness of an inch tube. 
Arc. first dressing your musk-basket with straw, fern, 
or small bushy furze without stems, six or eight inches 
in from the bottom of your basket, and set quite per- 
pendicularly oyer the whole, with the penstaff through 

No. 14. ' 2 T 



330 BRBWINO. 

the centre of the basket, and the middle of the fuize 
or fern, and fastened to the hole of the tab. To steady 
it properly, yon must have a piece of iron let into a 
staple fastened to the tub, at the nearest part opposite 
the basket, and to reach nearly to it ; and from that 
piece another added oh a jointed swivel, or any other 
contrivance, so as to be at liberty to let round the bas- 
ket like a dog s collar, and to enter into the staple form- 
ed in the same to pin it fast, and by adding a half cir- 
cular turn into the collar, in which you have room to 
drive in a wedge, which vdp keep it safe down to the 
bottom^ where there can be no danger of its being dis-^ 
turbed by stirrmg the mash, which will otherwise 
sometimes be the case. When you let go, you will 
nuse .he penrtaff to ycr own diee .iZlg. ^ 
then fasten the staff, by the help of two wedges tight-^ 
ened between the staff and the basket. 

In process of time the copper work, like every thing 
else, will become defective, and when thi^is the case, 
you may repair the imperfection by the following sim* 
pie method. Work the penstaff in the brass socket 
with emery and water, or oil, which will make it per- 
haps more perfect than when new. The like method 
is sometimes taken even with taps just purchased, in 
order to prevent their decaying so soon as they other- 
wise would. 

A very materiafl addition may be made fo the con- 
venience of the underbacks, by having a piece of cop- 
per to* line the hole in the bottom, which may be stop- 
ped with a cloth put singly round a large tap ; and 
when it is fastened down for the wort to run, it will be 
necessary to put a large weight on the tap, which will 
prevent its flying up by the heat. When the liquor 
is pumped clean out of the back, the cloth round the 
tap will enable you to take out the tap with ease ; and 
there should be a drain below the underback to carry 
off the water, which will enable you to wash it perfect- 
ly clean with very Httle trouble. This drain should* 
be made with a clear descent, so as no damp may re- 
main under the back. With the conveyance of water 



I 



BREWIIfO. 331 

« 

nmmng into your oopper, yon may be enabled to work 
that water in a double quantity^ yonr underback being 
* filled, by the means of letting it in at yonr leisure, oat 
of yonr copper, through a shoot to the mash-tub, and 
so to the underback. Thus you will have a reserve 
against the time you wish to fill yomr copper, which 
may be completed in a few minutes, by pumping while 
the under tap is running. Thus much for the princi- 
pal utensils in brewing, which we again recommend 
to be always kept in a perfect state of cleanliness. 



SECT- ly 

Of the proper Time of Breioing. 

The month of March is generally considered as one 
of the principal seasons for brewing malt liquor for 
long keeping ; and the reason is, because the air at 
that timeof the year is, in general, temperate, and con- 
tributes to the good working or fermentation of the 
liquor, which principally promotes its presa^ation and 
goad keeping. Very cold, as well as very hot weather, 
prevents the fi*ee fermentation or working of liquors ; 
«o that, if you brew in very cold weather, unless you 
use some means to warm the cellar vdoiile new drink 
is working, it wiU never clear itself in the manner you 
would wish, and the same misfortune will arise if, in 
very hot weather, the cellar is not put into a tempe- 
rate state ; the consequence of all which will be, that 
8uch drink will be muddy and sour, and, perhaps, in 
such a degree, as to be past recovery. Sudi accidents 
often happen, even in the proper season for brewing, 
and that owing to the badness of the cellar ; for when 
they are dug in springy grounds, or are subject to damps 
in the winter, the liquor wiU chili, and become vapid 
or flat. When cellars are of this nature, it is advisable 
to make your brewings in March, rather than in Octo- 
ber ; for you may keep your cellars temperate in sum- 
mer, but cannot warm them in winter. Thus your 
beer brewed in March will have due time to settle and 



332 BRKwiNe. 

adJQst itself before the cold can do it any materiai in- 
jury. 

AU cellars for keeping liquor should be formed in' 
such a manner, that no ectemal air can get into them ; 
for the variation of the air abroad, were there free ad- 
mission of it into the cellars, would cause as many alter- 
ations in the liquors, and would thereby keep them in 
«o unsettled a state, as to render them unfit for drink- 
ing. A constant temperate air digests and sc^ns 
malt liquors ; so that they taste quite soft and smooth 
to the palate ; but in cellars which are unequal, by 
letting in heats and colds, the liquor will be apt to 
sustain very material injury. 



SECT. V* 

On the Quality of Water proper for Brewing. 

It has evidently appeared from repeated experience, 
that the water best in quality for brewing is river- 
water, such as is soft, and has received those benefits 
which naturally arise firom the air and sun ; fi>r this 
easily penetrates into the grain, and extracts its virtues. 
On the contrary, hard waters astringe and bind the 
power of the mdt, so that its virtue is not freely com- 
municated to the liquor. There are some who hold 
, it as a maxim, that all water that will mix with soap 
is fit for brewing, which is the case with most river- 
water ; and it has been frequently experienced, that 
when the same quantity of malt has been used to a 
barrel of river-water, as to a barrel of spring-water, 
the brewing from the former has exceUed the other in 
strength above five degrees in twelve months keep. 
It is likewise to be observed, that the malt was not 
only the same in quantity for one barrel as for the 
other, but was the same in quality, having been all 
measured from the same heap. The hops were also 
the same, both in quality and quantity, and the time 
of boiling equal in each. They were worked in the 
same manner, and tunned and kept in the same cellar. 



BEEWIH6. 333 

This in the most demonstrable and nnd^able proof 
that the difference took place from the difference of 
the quality of the water. 

YarioQS experiments have been tried by gentlemen 
in different counties to ascertain the truth of this very 
essential difference in malt liquors, arising from the 
quality of the water ; but after all, they have been 
left in a state of perplexity. 

One circumstance has greatly puzzled the ablest 
brewers, and that is, when several gentlemen in the 
same town have employed the same brewer, have had 
the same malt, the same hops, and the same water, 
and brewed in the same month, and broached their 
drink at the same time, yet one has had beer exceeds 
ing fine, strong, and well-tasted, while the others 
have had hardly any worth drinking. In order to ac-^ 
count for this very singular difference, three reasons 
may be advanced. First, it might arise from the dif-* 
ference of the weather, which might happen at the 
several brewings in this month, and make an alteration 
in the working of the liquors. Secondly, the yeast, 
or barm, might be of different sorts, or in different 
states, wherewith these liquors were worked; and, 
thirdly, the cellars might not be equally adapted for 
the purpose. The goodness of such drink as is brew- 
ed for keeping, in a great measure depends on the 
proper form and temperature of the cellars in which 
it is placed. 

Beer made at Dorchester, which in general is 
greatly admired, is, for the most part, brewed with 
chalky- water, which is to be had in most parts of that 
county ; and as the soil is generally chalk, the cellars 
being dug in that dry soU, contribute to the good 
keeping of their drink, it being of a close texture, 
and of a drying quality, so as to dissipate damps ; for 
it has been found by experience that damp cellars are 
injurious to the keeping of liquor, as well as injurious 
to the casks. 

Water that is naturally of a hard quality may be, 
in some degree, softened by exposing it to the air and 



3S4 BREWING. 

BUD, and putting into it some pieces of soft chalk to 
infuse ; or, when the water is set on to boil, m order 
to be poured on the malt, put into it a quantity of 
bran, which will take off some part of its sharpness^ 
and make it better extract the virtues of the malt. 



SECT. VI. 

Of the Quality of the Malt and Haps most proper 
to be chosen for Brevnng, with some necessary 
Observations on tlie Management of each. 

There are two sorts of malt, the general distinc- 
tion between which is, that the one is high, and the 
other low dried. The former of these, when brewed, 
produces a liquor of a deep brown colour ; and the 
other, which is the low dried, will produce a liquor of 
a pale colour. The first is dried in such a manner as 
rather to be scorched than dried, and is much less 
wholesome than the pale malt. It has likewise been 
found by experience, that brown malt, althougli it 
may be well brewed, will sooner turn sharp than the 
pale ; itom whence, among other reasons, the latter is 
entitled to pre^^eminence. 

We have farther proofs of this distinction firom 
various people, but particularly one : — A gentleman, 
who has made the Art of Brewing his study for many 
years, and who gives his opinion and knowledge in 
words to this purpose, says, brown malt makes the 
best drink when it is brewed with a course river water, 
such as that of the Thames about London ; and that 
likewise being brewed with such water makes very 
good ale ; but that it will not keep above six months 
without turning stale, even though he allows fourteen 
bushels to the hogshead. He adds, that he has tried 
the high* dried malt to brew beer with for keeping and 
hopped it accordingly ; and yet he could never brew it 
so as to drink soft and mellow like that brewed with 
pale malt. There is, he says, an acid quality in the 
high-dried malt, which occasions those who drink it to 



BREWING. 335 

be greatly troubled with that disorder called the heart- 
bum. 

What we have here said with respect to malt, refers 
only to that made of barley ; fofr Wheat-malt, pea-malt, 
or high coloured liquor, will keep some years, and 
drink soft and smooth, but they are very subject to 
have the flavour of mum. 

Malt high dried should not be used in brewing till 
it has been ground ten days ot a fortnight, as it will 
then yield much stronger drink than firom the same 
quantity ground but a short time before it is used. 
On the contrary, pale malt, which has not received 
much of the fire^ must not remain ground above a 
week before it is used. 

With respect to hopg, the newest are by far the best* 
They will, indeed, remain very good for two years,, 
but after that they begin to decay, and lose their fla- 
vour, unless great quantities are kept together, in 
which case they will keep good much longer than in 
small quantities. In order the better to preserve them, 
they should be kept in a very dry place, contrary to 
the practice of those who deal in them, who making 
self-interest their first consideration, keep them as 
damp as they can to increase their weight. 

It will happen, in the course of time, that hops will 
grow stale, decayed, and lose their natural bitterness; 
but this defect may be removed, by unbagging them^ 
and sprinkling them with aloes and water. 

From what has been said, it is evident that every 
one of the particulars mentioned should be judiciously 
chosen before you commence brewing, otherwise you 
wiU sustain a loss, which will be aggravated by your 
labours being in vain. It is hkewise to be observed, 
that the yeast or barm with which you work your 
liquor, must be well considered, for otherwise, even by 
that alone, a good brewing may be totally destroyed. 
Be always particularly careful that you are provided 
with every, necessary article previous to your com- 
mencing the business of brewing ; for if the wort waits 
for any thing that should be un mediately at hand, it 
will be attended with very bad consequences.

SECT. vn. 

The ProcesSf or Practical Part of Bremng. 

Having, in the preceding sections, fully explained 
the necessary precautions to be taken previous to the 
commencement of this very important business, we 
shall now proceed to give a concise detail of every 
thing that is necessary to be observed and attended to 
in the regular process of it, firom the malt being first 
malted, to the liquor being turned off for the ceUar. 

Your utensils being all properly cleansed and scald^ 
ed, your malt ground, your water in the copper boil- 
ing, and your penstaff well set, yon must then proceed 
to mash, by putting a sufficient quantity of boiling wa- 
ter into your tub, in which it must stand until the 
greater part of the steam is gone off, or till you can 
see your own shadow in it. It will be then necessary 
that one person should pour the malt gently in, while 
another is carefiilly stirring it ; for it is equally essential 
that the same care should be observed when the mash 
is thin as when thick. This being effectually done, 
and having a sufficient reserve of malt to cover the 
mash, to prevent evaporation, you may cover your tub 
with sacks, &:c. and leave your malt three hours to 
steep, which will be a proper time for the extraction 
of its virtues. 

Before you let the mash run, be careful to be pre- 
pared with a pail to catch the first flush, as that id 
generally thickish, and another pail to be apphed while 
you return the first on the mash, and so on for two or 
three times, or, at least, till it runs fine. 

By this time, your copper should be boiling, and a 
convenient tub placed close to your mash-tub. LeC 
into it through your spout half the quantity of boiling 
water you mean to use for drawing off your best wort ; 
afler which you must instantly turn the tap to fill up 
again, which, with a proper attention to the fire, will 
boil in due time. During such time, you must slop 
the mash with this hot water out of the convenient 
tub, in moderate quantities, every eight or ten minutes 



till the whole is consamed ; and then let off the re* 
inaining quantity, which will be boiling hot, to the 
finishing process for strong beer. 

Having proceeded thus far, fill your copper, and lei 
it boil as quick as possible for the second mash, whe-^ 
ther you intend it either for ale or small beer. Being 
thus far prepared, let off the remaining quantity of 
water into your tub, as you did for the strong beer ; 
but if you would have small beer besides, you must 
act accordingly^ by boiling a proper quantity off in due 
time, and letting it into the tub as before. 

With respect to the quantity of malt, twenty-fouif 
bushels will make twd hogsheads of as good strong beer 
as any person would wish to drink, as also two hogs-< 
heads of very decent ale. The strong beer made fi-om 
this quantity of malt should be kept two or three 
years before it is tapped, and the ale never less than 
one. If your mash is only for one hogshead, it should 
be two hours in running off; if for two hogsheads, two 
hours and a half; and for any greater quantity, three 
hours. 

Particular attention must be paid to the time of 
steeping your mashes. Strong beer must be allowed 
three hours ; ale, one hour ; and, if you draw small 
beer after, half an hour. By this mode of proceeding, 
your boilings will regularly take place of each other, 
which will greatly expedite the business. Be careful^ 
in the course of mashing, that it is thoroughly stkred 
from the bottom, and especially round the muck-basket^ 
for, being well shaken, it will prevent a stagnation of 
the whole body of the mash< This last process de^- 
mands peculiar attention, for without it your beer will 
certainly be foxed^ and^ at best, wiU have a very dis-> 
agreeable flavour. 

In the preparation for boiling, the greatest care must 
be taken to put the hops in vvith the first wort, or it 
will char in a few minutes. As soon as the copper is 
full enough, make a good fire under it; but be careful 
in filling it to leave room enough for boiling. Quick 
boiling is part of the business that requires very par^

S38 BREWING. 

ticular attention. Great caution should likewise be 
observed when the liquor begins to swell in waves in 
the copper. If you have no attendant, be particular 
attentive to its motions ; and being provided with an 
iron rod of a proper length, crooked at one end, and 
jagged at the other, then with the crook you are ena- 
bled to open the furnace, or copper-door, and with 
the other end push in the damper without stirring &om 
your station ; but on the approach of the first swell 
you will have sufficient time to proportion your fire, as 
care should be taken that it is not too fierce. When 
the boil is properly got under, you may increase the 
fire so that it may boil briskly. 

In order to ascertain the proper time the liquor 
should boil, you may make use of the following ex- 
pedient : take a clean copper bowl dish, dip out some 
of the liquor, and when you discover a workmg, and 
the hops sinking, then conclude it to be sufficiently 
boiled. Long and slow boiling is notonly pernicious, 
but it likewise wastes the liquor; for the slower it boils 
the lower it drops and singes to your copper ; whereas, 
quick boihng has a contrary efiect. Essence of malt 
is extracted by length of boihng, by w^hich you can 
make it to the thickness of honey or treacle. In some 
parts of Yorkshu-e they value their liquor for its 
great strength, by its affecting the brain for two or 
three days after intoxication. This is the effect of lon^ 
boiling; for in that county they boil liquor for three 
hours ; and what is still worse, when it sinks in the 
copper, from the waste in boiling, they every now and 
then add a little fresh wort, which, without doubt, must 
produce stagnation, and, consequently, impurities. 

When your Uquor is properly boiled, be sure to tra- 
verse a small quantity of it over all the coolers, so as 
to get a proper quantity cold immediately to set to 
work ; but if the airiness of your brewhouse is not suf^ 
ficient to expedite a quantity soon, you must traverse 
a second quantity over the coolers, and then let it into 
shallovr tubs. Put these into any passage where there 
is a thorough draft of air, but where no rain or otiw 



BftEWlMG. 3S9 

wet can get to it. Then let off the quantity of two 
baring-tubsfali from the first one, the second and third 
coolers, which may be soon got cold, to be ready for a 
speedy working, and then the remaining part that is in 
yonr copper may be quite let out into the first cooler. 
In the mean time mend the fire, and also attend to the 
hops, to make a clear passage through the strainer. 

Having proceeded thus far, as soon as the liquor is 
done running, return to your business of pumping ; but 
be careful to remember, that, when you have got four 
or five pails full, you then return all the hops into the 
copper for the ale. 

By this time the small quantity of liquor traversed 
over your coolers being sufficiently cooled, you must 
proceed to set your Uquor to work, the manner of doing 
which is as follows : 

Take four quarts of barm, and divide half of it into 
small vessels, such as clean bowls, basins, or mugs, add- 
ing thereto an equal quantity of wort, which should be 
almost cold. As soon as it ferments to the top of the 
vessel, put it into two pails, and when that works to 
the top, put one into a baring-tub, and the other into 
another. When you have half a baring-tub full toge- 
ther, you may put the like quantity to each of them, 
and then cover them over, until it comes to a fine white 
head. This may be perfectly completed in three hours, 
and then put those two quantities into the working 
guile. You may now add as much wort as you have 
got ready; for, ii the weather is open, you cannot work 
it too cold. If you brew in cold frosty weather, keep 
the brewhouse warm : but never add hot wort to keep 
the liquor to a blood heat, that being a bad maxim ; 
fi)r hot wort put to cold, as well as cold to hot, is so 
intemperate in its nature, that it stagnates tlie proper 
operation of the barm. 

Be particularly careful that your barm be not from 
foxed beer, that is, beer heated by ill management in 
its working ; for in that case it is likely to carry with it 
the contagion. If your barm be flat, and you cannot 
procure that which is new^ the method of recovering 



040 BRSWING. 

its working is, by putting to it a pint of warm sweet 
wort> of your first letting off, the heat to be about half 
liie degree of milk-warm : then give the vessel that 
contains it a shakei and it will soon gather strength, 
and be fit for use. 

With respect to the quantity of hops necessary to be 
used, remember that half a pound of good hops is soffit 
cient for a bushel of malt. 

The last, and most simple operation in the business 
of brewing is, that of tunning, the general methods 
of doing which are, either by having it carried into 
tbe cellar on men's shoulders, or conveying it thither 
by means of leathern pipes commonly used for that 
purpose. 

Your casks being perfectly dean, sweet and dry, and 
placed on the stand ready to receive the liquor, first 
i&im off the top barm, then proceed to fill your casks 
quite full, and immediately bung and peg them close, 
Bore a hole with a tap-borer near the summit of the 
^tave at the same distance fix)m the top, as the lower 
tap-hole is fi^m the bottom, for working through that 
upper hole, which is a clean and more effectual method 
than working it over the cask ; for, by the above me- 
thod, being so closely confined, it soon sets itself into a 
convulsive motion of working, and forces itself fine, 
provided you attend to the filling of your casks five or 
six times a day. This ought to be carefully attended 
to, for, by too long an omission, it begins to settle, and 
being afterwards disturbed, it raises a sharp fermen* 
tation, which produces an incessant working of a spu- 
rious froth that may continue for some weeks, and, 
lifter idl, give your beer a disagreeable taste. 

One material caution necessary to be kept in retnem- 
brance is this : that however careful you may be in at- 
tending to all the preceding particulars, yet if your 
ca^ks are not kept in good order, still the brewing may 
foe spoiled. New casks are apt to give liquor a bad 
taste, if they are not well scalded and seasoned several 
days successively before they are used ; and old casks, if 
fdbey Btand any time out of use, are apt to grow mus^. 



BREWING, 841 

Having thns gone through the practical part of brew- 
ing, and brought the liquor from the mash-tub to the 
es^^ we shall now proceed to 

SECT, vin. 

Containing the proper Management of Malt Liquors^ 
with some necessary Observations on the Whole. 

In order to keep -strong beer in a proper state of pre- 
servation, remember, that when once the vessel is 
broached, regard must be paid to the time in which it 
may be expended ; for, if there happens to be a quick 
draught for it, then it wiU last good to the very bottom ; 
but if there is likely to be but a slow draught, then do 
not draw off quite half before you bottle it, otherwise 
it will grow flat, dead, or sour. 

In proportion to the quantity of liquor which is en- 
closed in one cask, so will it be a shorter or longer 
time in ripening. A vessel, which contains two hogs- 
heads of beer, will require twice as much time to per- 
fect itself as one of a hogshead ; and it is found, by ex- 
perience, that no vessel should be used for strong beer 
(which is intended to be kept) less than a hogshead, 
as one of that quantity, if it is fit to draw in a year, 
will have body enough to support it for two, three, 
or four years, provided it has a sufficient streifgth 
of malt and hops, which is the case with Dorchester 
beer. 

With respect to the management of small beer, the 
first consideration should be to make it tolerably good 
in quality, which, in various instances, will be found 
truly economical ; for if it is not good, servants, for 
whom it is principally calculated, will be feeble in 
summer time, incapable of strong work, and subject 
to various disorders. Besides, when the beer is bad, 
a great deal will be thrown away ; whereas, on the 
contrary, good wholesome drink will be valued, and 
consequently taken care of It is advisable therefore, 
where there is a good cellaring, to brew a stock of 



34fi BRSWIIfO. 

small beer in March or October, or in both months, to 
be kept, if possible, in hogsheads. 

The beer brewed in March should not be tapped 
till October, nor that breWed in October till the March 
following; having this regard to the quantity, that 
a family, of the same number of working people, will 
drink at least one third more in summer than in 
winter. 

In order to fine beer, some people, who brew with 
high dried barley malt, put a bag, containing about 
three pints of wheat into every hogshead of Uquor, 
which has had the desired effect, and made the beer 
drink soft and mellow. Others again, have put about 
three pints of wheat-malt into a hogshead, which has 
produced the like effect 

But all malt liquors, however well they may be 
brewed, may be spoiled by bad ceUaring ; be subject 
to ferment in the cask, and consequentiy turn thick 
and sour. When this happens to be the case, the best 
way of bringing the liquor to itself is, to open the bung- 
hole of the cask for two or three days ; and if that does 
not stop the fermentation, then put in about two or 
three pounds of oyster shells, washed, dried well in an 
oven, and then beaten to a fine powder. After you 
have put it in stir it a little, and it will soon settle 
the liquor, make it fine, and take off the sharp taste. 
When you find this effected, draw it off into another 
vessel, and put a small bag of ..wheat, or wheat-malt 
into it, in proportion to the size of the vessel. It 
sometimes occurs, that such fermentations will happen 
in liquor from a change of weather, if it is in a bad cel- 
lar, and will, in a few months, fall fine of itself, and 
grow mellow. 

In some country places remote firom principal towns, 
it is a practice to dip whisks into yeast, then beat it 
well, and hang up the whisks, with the yeast in them, 
to dry ; and if there be no brewing tiU two months 
afterwards, the beating and stirring oke of the whisks 
in new wort will soon raide a working or fermentation. 
It is a rule, that all liquor should be worked well in 



BKEWiva. 343 

the tan, heSate it is pat into the vessel, otherwise it 
will not easily grow fine. Some follow the role of 
beating down the yeast pretty often while it is in the 
ton, and keep it there working for two or three days,, 
observing to put it into the vessel just when the yeast 
begins to foU. This liquor is in general very fine, 
whereas, on the contrary, that which is put into the 
.vessel soon after it is brewed will be several months 
before it comes to a proper state of perfection. 

We have before taken notice of the season for brew* 
ing malt liquors to keep. But it may not be improper 
further to observe, that if the cellars are subject to the 
heat of the sun, or warm summer air, it will be best 
to brew in October, that the liquor may have time to 
digest before the warm season comes on ; and if cel- 
lars are subject to damp, and to receive water, the best 
time will be to brew in March. Some experi^iced 
brewers always choose to brew with the pale malt iu 
March, and the brown in October ; supposing, that the 
pale malt, being made with a less degree of fire than 
the other, wants the summer sun to ripen it ; and so^ 
on the contrary, the brown, having had a larger share 
of the fire to dry it, is nH)re capable of defending itself 
against the cold of the winter season. 

All that remains further to be said relative to the 
management of malt liquors, we shall preserve in 

SECT. IX. 

Containing the proper Method of bottling Matt 

Liquors. 

As a necessary preparation for executing this hxm^ 
ness properly, great attention must be paid to your 
bottles, which must first be well cleaned and dried ; 
for wet bottles will make the liquor turn mouldy or 
mothery, as it is called ; and by wet bottles a great 
deal of good beer is frequently spoiled. Though the 
bottles may be clean and dry, yet, if the corks are not 
new and sound, the liquor will be still liable to be 
damaged ; for, if the air can get into the bottles, ttie 



844 BftfiWiHa. 

liqaor will grc^ flat, and never rise. Many who hate 
flattered themselves they knew how to be saving, by 
using old corks on this occasion, have spoiled as much 
Uquor as stood them in four or five pounds, only for 
want of laying out three or four shillings* If bottles 
are corked as they sliould be^ it will be difficult to draw 
the cork without a screw ; and to secure the drawing 
of the cork without breaking, the screw ought to go 
through the cork, and then the air must necessarily fiind 
a passage where the screw has passed. If a cork had 
once been in a bottle^ though it has not been draws 
with a screw, yet that cork will turn musty as soon as 
exposed to the air, and will communicate its ill flavour 
to the bottle in which it is next put, and spoil the liquor 
that way. In the choice of corks, take those that are 
soft and clear from specks* You may also observe, in 
the bottling of liquor, that the top and middle of the 
hogshead are the strongest, and will sooner rise in 
the bottles than the bottom* When you begin to 
bottle a vessel of any liquor, be sure not to leave it 
till all is completed, otherwise it will have diflferent 
tastes. 

If you find a vessel o( liquor begins to grow flat 
whilst it is in common draught, bottle it, and into every 
bottle put a piece of loaf sugar of about the size of a 
walnut^ which will make it rise and come to itself s 
and, to forward its ripening, vou may set some bottles 
in hay in a warm place; but'straw wiU not assist its 
ripening. 

If you should have the opportunity of brewing 4 
good stock of small beer in March and October, some 
of it may be bottled at the end of six months, putting 
into every bottle a lump of loaf sugar ; which, in the 
summer, will make it a very pleasant and refireshing 
drink. Or if you happen to brew in smnmer, and 
are desirous of brisk small beer, as soon as it is done 
working, bottle it as before directed. 

Where your cellars happen not to be properly calcu-* 
lated for the preservation of your beer, you may use 
the following expedient * Sink holes in the ground, poC 



BRfiWIl^G. 34& 

into them large oil-jars, and fill up the earth close about 
the sides. One of the jars^ will hold about two dozen 
bottles, and will keep the liquor in proper order ; but 
care must be taken that the tops of the jars are kept 
close covered. In winter time, when the weather i» 
firosty, shut up all the lights or windows of your cellars,, 
and cover them close with horse-dung, which wiU keep 
your beer in a very proper and temperate state. 

We shall close this section and chapter with that 
information, which, if properly attended to, may be 
found, at times, of ibe highest convenience and utility^ 

To Preserve Yeast. 

If you wish to preserve a large stock of yeast, which 
will keep and be of use for several months, either for 
brewing, or to make bread or cakes, you must follow 
these directions. When you have plenty of yeast, and 
are apprehensive of a future scarcity, take a quantity 
of it, stir and work it well with a whisk, until it be- 
comes liquid and thin^ Then get a large wooden platter^ 
cooler or tub, clean and dry, and with a soft brush lay 
a thin layer of yeast on the tub, and turn the mouth 
downwards, that no dust may faU npon i% but so that 
the an* may get under to dry it. When tliat coat ii^ 
very dry, then lay on another, and so on till you have 
a sufficient quantity, even two or three inches thick/ 
always taking care that the yeast is very dry in the 
tub before you lay any more on, and this wiU keep 
good for several months. When you have occasion ta 
use this yeast, cut a piece off, and lay it into warmr 
water ; tiben stir it together, and it will be fit for use^ 
If it is for Inrewing, take a large handful of birch tied 
together, dip it into the yeast, and hang it up to dry^r 
In this manner you may do as many as you please ; 
"but take care no dust comes to it. When your beer is^ 
fit to set to work, throw in one of these,* and it will 
make it work as well as if you had made firesh yeast..

CHAPTER XXX. 
DIRECTIONS FOR TRUSSING POULTRY, &c. 

THERE are varions reasons why the experienced 
and prudent housekeeper should be properly acquaint- 
ed with this necessary preparation to the Art of 
Cookery. In London every article is generally trussed 
by the poulterer of whom it is bought ; but it n-equent- 
ly happens that, either from inexperience or negligence 
of the servants, and want of knowledge in ,the cook, 
the article appears on the table with disgrace. Another 
very substantial reason for the cook having this know 
ledge is, that the families in which they serve are fre- 
quently in counties where there are no poulterers, and 
consequently they are imder the necessity of killing 
and trussing their own poultry. To be prepared, 
therefore, for the execution of this business, we recom- 
mend a proper attention to the following general roles : 
be careful that all the stubs are perfectly taken out ; 
and when you draw any kind of poultry, you must be 
very particular to avoid breaking the gall, for should 
that happen, no means can be used to take away that 
bitterness, which will totally destroy the natural and 
proper taste of the article dressed. Great care should 
likewise be taken that you do not break the gut join- 
ing to the gizzard ; for, ^ould this happen, the inside 
wUl be gritty, and the whole spoiled. These are to be 
attended to as general matters. We shall proceed to 
particulars, beginning with 

Turkeys. 

Having properly picked your turkey, break thel^ 
bone close to the foot, and draw out the strings from 
the thigh, for. which purpose you must hang it on a 
hook fastened against the wall. Cut off the neck dose 
to the back ; but be careful to leave the crop skin suffi- 
ciently long to turn over the back. Then proceed to 
take out the crop, and loosen the liv^r and gut at the 
throat end with your middle finger. Then cut off the 



TRUSSING POULTRY. 347 

vent, and take out the gut. Pull out the gizzard with 
a crooked, sharp pointed iron, and the liver will soon 
follow ; but be careful not to break the gall. Wipe 
the inside perfectly clean with a wet cloth; having 

^ done which, cut the breast-bone through on each side 
close to the back, and draw the legs close to the crops. 

^ Then put a cloth on the brekst, and beat the high bone 
down with a rolling-pin till it lies flat. If the turkey 
is to be trussed for boiUng, cut the legs off; then put 
your middle finger into the inside, raise the skin of th,e 
legs, and put them under the apron of the turkey. 
Put a skewer into the joint of the wing and the middle 
joint of the leg, and run it through the body and the 
other leg and wing. The liver and gizzard must be 
put in me pinions ; but be careful first to open the 
gizzard and take out the filth, and tlie gall of the liver. 
Then turn the small end of the pinion on the back, 
and tie a packthread over the ends of the legs to keep 
them in their places. If the turkey is to be roasted, 
leave the 1^ on, put a skewer in the joint of the wing, 
tuck the legs close up, and put the skewer through 
the middle of the legs and body. On the other side, 
put another skewer in at the smaU part of the leg. 
Put it close on the outside of the sidesman, and put 
the skewer through, and the same on the other side. 
Put the liver and gizzard between the pinions, and 
turn the point of the pinion on the back. Then put, 
close above the pinions, another skewer through the 
body of the turkey. 

It turkey-poults; they must be trussed as follow : 
take the neck from the head and body, but do not re- 
move the neck skin. They are drawn in the same 
manner as a turkey. Put a skewer through the joint 
of the pinion, tuck the legs close up, run the skewer 
through the middle of the leg, through the body, and 
so on the other side. Cut off the under part of the 
bill, twist the skin of the neck round, and put the head 
on the point of the skewer, with the bill-end forwards. 
Another skewer must be put in the sidesman, and the 
legs placed between the sidesman and apron on each 



348 TRUssma 

side. Pass die skewer through all, and cut off the 
toe-nails. It is very common to lard them on the 
breast. The liver and gizzard may or maj not be 
used, as you like^ 

Whsn you have properly picked your fowls, cut oft 
the neck close to the back. Then take out the crop, 
and with your middle finger loosen the liver and other 
matters^ Out off the vent, draw it dean^ and beat 
the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin. If your fowl 
is to be boiled, cut off tb^ nails of the feet, and tuck 
them down close to the legs. Put your finger into 
the in^de, and raise the stun of the legs; then cut a 
bole in tl^ top of the #kin, and put ti^e legs under. 
Put a skewer in the first joint of llie pinion, luring the 
middle of the leg close to it, put the skew^ through 
the middle of the leg, and through the body ; and then 
do the same on the other side. Having opened the 
gizzard* take out the filth, and the gall out of the liver. 
Put the gizzaid and the Uver in the pinion, turn the 
points on the baek, and tie a string over the tops of the 
legs to keep tiliem in their proper {dace. Jf your fowl 
is to be roasted, put a akewer in the first joint of the 
pinion* and bring the middle of the 1^ ek>se to it. Put 
the skewer through the middle of the leg, and through 
the body, and do the same on tbe other side. Put an- 
other skewer in the small of the 1^ and through the 
mdesman ; do the same on the other 4side, and then 
put another through the skin of the feet You must 
not hrget to cut off the nails of the feet 

Chickens. 

With respect to picking and drawing, they must 
tie done in the same manner as fowls. If they aro to 
he boQed, cat off the n^ils, give the sinews a nich on 
^each side of the joint, put the feet in at the vent, and 
then peel the rump. Draw the skin tight over the 1^, 
put a skewer in the first joint of the pinion, and bring 
the middle of the leg close. Put the skewer through 
the middle of the legs, and through the body, and do 



FOULTRT. 319 

the same oti the other side. Clean the gizzard, and 
take out the gall in the liver ; put them into the pinions, 
and twm the points on the hack. If yonr chickens are 
to he roasted^ cut off the feet, pnt a skewer in the first 
joint of the pinions, and bring the middle of the leg 
close. Run the skewer through the middle of the Ic^, 
and through the body, and do the same on the other 
;8ide. Put another skewer into the sidesman^ put the 
legs between the apron a^d the sidesman, and run the 
«kewe through. Having cleaned the liver and giz*^ 
zard, put them in the pinions, turn the points on the 
back, and pull the breast skin over the neck. 

Oeese. 

Having picked and stubbed yoUr goose clean, cut 
the feet off at the joint, and the pinion off the first joint. 
Then cut off the neck ahnost close to the back ; but 
leav« the skin of the neck k>ng enough to turn over 
the back. Pull out the throat, and tie a knot at the 
eni. With your middle finger loosen the liver and 
x>ther matters at the breast end, and cut it open be*- 
tween the vent and the rump. Having done this, draw 
out all the entrails, excepting the soul. Wipe it out 
^lean with a wet doth, and beat the breast bone flat 
with a rolling-pin. Put a skewer into the wing, and 
•draw the legs close up. Put the «kewer tlirough the 
middle of the leg, ana through the body, and the same 
on the other side. Put another skewer in the small 
of the leg, tuck it close down to the sidesman^ run it 
through, and do the same on the other side. Cut off 
the end ef the vent» and make a hide large enough for 
the passage of the rump, as by that means it will much 
i^tter keep in the seasoning. 

Ducks are trussed in the same manner, except that 
(the feet must be left on^ and turned close to the legs. 

Pigemis. 

When you have picked them, and cut off the neck 
.close to the back, then take out the crop, cut off the 
vent, and draw out the guts and gisszard. but leave 



350 TRUSSING 

the liver, for a pigeon has no gall. If th^ey are to be 
roasted, cat off the toes, cat a slit in one of the legs, 
and put the other through it. Draw the leg tight to 
the pinion, put a skewer through the pinions, legs, and 
body, and with the handle of the knife break the breast 
flat. Clean the gizzard, put it in one of the pinions, 
and turn the points on the back. If yon intend to make 
a pie of them, you must cut the feet off at the joints 
turn the Iqp, and stick them in the sides close to the 
pinions. If they are to be stewed or boiled, they must 
be done in the same manner. 

WUd Fowl. 

Having picked them clean, cut off the neck dose 
to the back, and with your middle finger loosen the 
liver and guts next the breast. Cut off the pinions at 
the first joint, then cut a slit between the vent and the 
rump, and draw them clean. Clean them properly 
with the long feathers on the wing, cut off the nails^ 
and turn the feet close to the legs. Put a skewer in 
the pinion, pull the legs close to the breast, and run 
the skewer through the legs, body, and the other pin- 
ion. First cut off the vent, and then put the rump 
through it. The directions here given are to be fol- 
lowed in trussing every kind of wild fowl. 

Pheasants and Partridges. 

Having picked them very clean, cut a slit at the 
back of the neck, take out the crop, and loosen the 
liver and gut next the breast with your fore-finger, 
then cut off the vent and draw them. Cut off the 
pinion at the first joint, and wipe out the inside with 
the pinion you have cut off. Beat the breast bone flat 
with a rolling-pin, put a skewer in the pinion, and bring 
the middle of the legs close. Then ran the skewer 
through the legs, body, and the other pinion, twist 
the head, and put it on the end of the skewer, with the 
bill fronting the breast. Put another skewer into the 
sidesman, and put the legs close on each side the apron, 
and then run the skewer through all. If you would

You may lil^ewise save the long feathers in the tail to

fowl. 

All kinds of moor game most be trussed in the same 
manner. 

Woodcocks and Snipes. 

As these birds are remarkably tender to pick, espe- 
cially if they should not happen to be quite fresh, the 
greatest care must be taken how you handle them ; for 
even the heat of the hand will sometimes take off the 
skin, which will totally destroy the beautiful appear- 
ance of the bird. Having picked them clean, cut the 
pinions of the first joint, and with the handle oif a knife 
beat the breast-bone flat. Turn the legs close to the 
thighs, and tie them together at the joints. Put the 
thigh close to the pinions, put a skewer into the pin- 
ions, and run it through the thighs, body, and the 
other pinion. Skin the head, turn it, take out the eyes, 
and put the head on the point of the skewer, with the 
bill close to the breast. Remember, that these birds 
must never be drawn. 

Larks. 

When vou have picked them properly, cut off their 
heads, and the pinions of the first joint. Beat the 
breast-bone flat, and turn the feet close to the legss, 
and put one into the other. Draw out the gizzard, 
and run a skewer through the middle of the bodies. 
Tie the skewer fast to the spit when you put them 
down to roast. Wheat eare, and other small birds, 
must be done in the same manner. 

Hares.

and slip oat the fore-legs. Cut the skin cS the neek 
and head; but take care to leave the ears on, and 
mind to ddn them. Take out the liver, j^ts, &c. 
and be sure to draw the gut out of the vent Cut the 
nnews that lie under the hind-lc^, bring them up to 
the fi»re-leg8, put a skewer through the hind-leg, then 
through the fiire-1^ under the joint, run it through the 
body, and do the same on the other side^ Put another 
skewer through the thick part of the hind-legs and 
body, put the head between the shoulders, and run a 
skewer through to keep it in its place. Put a ^ewer 
in each ear to make them stand erect, and tie a string 
round the middle of the body over the legs to keep 
them in their place. A young fawn must be trussed 
just in the same manner, except that tiie ears must be 
cutoff. 

Rabbits must be cased much in the same manner 
as hares, only observing to cut off the ears close to the 
head. Cut open the vent, and slit the 1^ about an 
inch up on each side of the rump. Make the hind-I^p» 
lie flat, and bring the ends to the £bre-lags. Put a 
skewer into the hind-1^, then into the fere-leg, and 
throu^ the body. Bring the head round, and put it 
on the skewer. If you want to roast two together^ 
truss them at full length with six skewers run through 
them both, so that tl^y may be properly fastened oa 
the spit. 



THE 

ft 

ART OF CARVING. 



NOTHING can be more disagreeable to a person who is placed 
ac the head of a table, and whose business it is to pay the necessary 
honours to guests invited, than to be defective in not being properly 
able to carve the different articles provided. From the want of 
knowledge in this particular, it must naturally become no less painful 
to the person who undertakes the task, than uncomfortable to those 
who are waiting for the compliment of being served. Abilities and 
dexterity in this art are striking qualifications in the eyes of every 
company, and are material instruments of forming the necessary and 
polite graces of the table. 

The instructions here laid down by words, are materially enliven- 
ed by the representations of the respective articles described, so that 
the young and inexperienced may, by proper attention to the descrip- 
tion, and reference to the plates, soon ntake themselves proficients 
in this useful and polite art. 

We shall commence the subject with describing the method of 
carving 

A Roast Fowl. 

In the plate the fowl is placed in the centre, and is represented as 
lying on its side, with one of the legs, wings, and neck-bone, taken 
off. Whether the fowl is roasted or boiled, it must be cut up in the 
same manner. A roasted fowl is sent to table nearly in the same 
manner as a pheasant, excepting that the pheasant has the bead 
tucked under one of the wings, whereas the fowl has the head cut off 
before it is dressed. In a boiled fowl (which is represented in the 
same plate) the legs'are bent inwards, and tucked into the belly ; but, 
previous to its being sent to table, the skewers are withdrawn. The 
roost convenient method of cutting up a fowl is to lay it on your 
plate, and, as you separate the joints, in the line a, 6, </, put mem 
mto the dish. — 

The legs, wings, and merry-thought being removed, the next thing 
is to cut off the neck-bones. This is done by putting in the knife at 
gj and passing it under the long broad part of the bone in the line gy 6, 
tiien lifting it up, and breaking off the end of the shorter part of the 
bone, which cleaves to the breast-bone. All the parts being thus 
separated from the carcase, divide the breast from the back, by cut- 
ting through the tender ribs on each side, from the neck quite down 
to the vent or tail. Then lay the back upwards on your plate, fix 

Sour fork under the rump, and laying the edge of your knife in the 
ne 6, C| c, and pressing it down, lifl up the t^, or lower part of the 

2Y 



354 CARVING. 

back, and h will readily divide with the help of your knife in the 
6, ey c. In the next place, lay the lower part of the back upwards in 
your plate, with the rump from you, and cut off the side-bonee, (or 
sidesmen, as they are generally called,) by forcing the knife through 
the rump-bone, in the line 6,/, when your fowl will be completely 
cut up. 

Boiled Fotch 

We have before observed, that a boiled fowl is cut up in the same 
manner as one roasted. In the representation of this the fowl is com- 
plete, whereas in that part of the other it is in part dissected. Those 
parts, which are generally considered as the most prime, are the 
wings, breast, and merry-ihought, and next to these the neck-bones, 
and sidesmen. The legs of boiled fowls are more tender than those 
that are roasted ; but every part of a chicken is good and juicy. As 
the thigh bones of a chicken are very tender, and easily broken with 
the teeth, the gristles and marrow render them very delicate. In the 
boiled fowl the leg should be separated from the drum-stick, at the 
joint, which is easily done, if the knife is introduced into the hollow, 
and the thigh-bone turned back from the leg-bone. 

Partridge* 

The iPartridge is here represented as just taken from the spit; bat 
before it is served up, the skewers must be withdrawn. It is cut up 
in the same manner as a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the 
lines a J 6, and the merry-thought in the line c, d. The prime parts 
of a partridge are, the wings, breast, and merry-thought. The wing 
is considered as the best, and the tip of it reckoned the most delicate 
morsel of the whole. 

Pigeons* 

Herb are the representations of two, the one with the back upper- 
most, and the other with the breast. — That with the back uppermost 
is marked No. 1. and that with the breast No. 2. Pigeons are some- 
times cut up in the same manner as chickens. But as the lower 
part, with the thigh, is in general most preferred, and as, from its 
small size, half a one is not too much for most appetites, they are 
seldom carved now, otherwise than by fixing the fork at the point a, 
entering the knife just before it, and dividing the pigeon into two, 
cutting away in the lines a, b, and a, r, No. 1, at the same time bring- 
ing the knife out at the back, in the direction a, by and a, c, No. 2* 

A Pheasant, 

In the representation, here given, the bird appears in a proper 
state for the spit, with the head tucked under one of the wings. 
When laid in the dish, the skewers drawn, and the bird carried to 
table, it must be carved as follows : fix your fork on that part of the 
breast where the two dots are marked, by which means you will have 
a full command of the bird, and can turn it as you liiink proper. 
Slice down the breast in the lines a, 6, and then proceed to take off 
the leg on one side, in the direction c/, r, or in the circular dotted 



ciRvmo. 955 

fine hf <f. This done, cut off the wing on the same side, in the line 
c, d» When you have separated the leg and wing on one side, do 
the same on the other, and then cut off, or separate from the hreast- 
bone, on each side of the breast, the parts you before sliced or cut 
down. Be very attentive in taking off the wing. Cut it in the 
notch a, for if you cut too near the neck, as at g, you will find your- 
self interrupted by the neck-bone, from whence the wing must be 
separated. Having done this, cut off the merry-thought in the line 
ff g, by passing the knife under it towards the neck. With respect 
to the remaining parts, they are to be cut up in the same manner as 
directed for a roast fowl. The parts most admired in a pheasant are, 
first, the breast, then the wings, and next the merry-thought. 

A Goose,' 

Let the neck-end lie before you, and begin by cutting two or 
three long slices on each side the breast, in the lines a, 6, quite to the 
bone. Cut these shoes from the bone, then take off the leg, turning 
the goose up on one side, putting the fork through the small end of 
the leg bone, and pressing it close to the body, which, when the knife 
has entered at d, will easily raise the joint* Then pass the knife 
under the leg in the direction dj e. If the leg hangs to the carcase, 
at the point e, turn it back with the fork, and, if the goose is young, 
it will easily separate. Having removed the leg, proceed to take off 
the wing, by passing the fork through the small end of the pinion, 
pressing it close to the body, and entering the knife at the notch c, 
and passing it under the wing in the direction c, d. This is a very 
nice thing to hit, and can only be acquired by practice. When you 
have taken off the leg and wing on one side, do the same on the 
other. Then cut off the apron in the Ime/, e, g, having done which, 
take off the merry-thought in the line t, h. All the other parts are to 
be taken off in the same manner as directed for the fowl. A goose 
is seldom quite dissected, unless the company is very large, in which 
case the above method must be pursued. 

The parts of a goose most esteemed are, the slices from the 
breast; the fleshy part of the wing, which may be divided from the 
pinion ; the thigh-bone, (or drum-stick as it is called,) the pinion, and 
the side-bones. If sage and onions are put into the body of the goose, 
(which is by most approved of,) when you have cut off the limbs, 
draw it out with a spoon at the place from whence the apron is taken, 
and mix it with the gravy, which should first be poured boiling hot 
into the body of the goose. Some people are particularly fond of the 
rump, which, after being nicked with a knife, is peppered and salted, 
and then broiled till it is of a nice light brown ; and this is distin- 
guished by the epithet of a deviL The same is likewise done by the 
rump of a turkey. 

Haunch of Venison. 

First cut it across down the bone, in the line ft, c, a, then turn the 
dish with the end (/, towards you, put in the point of the knife at c, 
and cut it down as deep as you can in the direction r, r/, so that the 
two strokes will then form the resemblauce of the letter T. Having 



8M CAKVINO. 

cot^ tluuy you may cut as many slices as are neceaaafj, wooot&tg 
to the number of the company, cutting them either on the right or 
left As the fat lies deeper on the left between d and a, those who 
are fond of fat, (as is the case with most admirers of venison,) the beat 
flavoured and fattest slices will be found on the lefl of the line e^ dj 
supposing the end d turned towards you. In cutting the slices, re- 
member that they must not be either too thick or too thin. With 
each slice of lean add a proper proportion of fat, and put a sufficient 
quantity of gravy into each plate. Currant-jelly should always be on 
the table for those who choose it. Indeed this is generally used by 
most 

A Fore^Quarter of. Lamb. 

This joint is always roasted, and when it comes to table, before 
you can help any one, you must separate the shoulder from the breast 
and ribs, (or what is by some called the coast,) by passing the fcoife 
under, in the direction c, g^ d^ e. The shoulder, being then taken 
off, the juice of a lemon, or Seville orange, should be squeezed upon 
the part it was taken from, a little salt added, and the shoulder re- 
placed. The gristly part must then be separated from the ribs in the 
line y, gy and then all the preparatory business to serving will be 
done. The ribs are generally most esteemed, and one, two, or more 
may be easily separated from the rest, in the line a, b ; but to those 
who prefer the gristly part, a piece or two may be cut off in the lines 
kf t\ &c. If you should have a fore-quarter of grass lamb that runs 
large, the shoulder, when cut off, must be put into another dish, and 
carved in the same manner as a shoulder of mutton. 

A no is seldom sent whole to table, but is usually cut up by the 
cook, who takes off the head, splits the body down the back, and 
garnishes the dish with the chops and ears. 

Before you help any one at table, first separate the shoulders from 
the carcase, and then the legs, according to the direction given by 
the dotted line r, d, e. The most delicate part of a pig is that about 
the neck, which may be cut off in the line/, g. The next best parts 
are the ribs, which may be divided in the line a, 5, &c and the others 
are pieces cut from the legs and shoulders. Indeed the bones of a 
pig are tittle else than gristle, so that it may be cut in any part with- 
out the least difficulty. It produces such a variety of delicate bits, 
that the fancies of most may be readily gratified. 

Shoulder of Mutton. 

This is a very fine joint, and by many preferred to the leg, it being 
very full of gravy, if properly roasted, and producing many nice bits. 
The figure rTo. 1, represents it as laid in the dish with the back up- 
permost* When it is first cut, it should be in the hollow part of it in 
the direction a, 6, and the knife should be passed deep to the bone. 
The gravy will then run fast into the dish, the part will immediately 
open, and many fine slices will be readily cut from iu The prime 



CARTING. 35T 

fdH of the fat lies on the outer edge, aod is to be cut out io thiiilriice* 
in the direction f , f. If many are at table, and the holtow part cot ia 
the line a, 6, is eaten, some very good and delicate slices may be cut 
out on each side the ridge of the blade-bone, in the direction c, d. 
The line between these two dotted lines, is that in the direction of 
which the edge, or ridge of the blade-bone lies, and cannot be cut 
across. 

No. 2 represents the under-side, where there are two parts very 
full of gravy, and such as many prefer to the upper-side. One is a 
deep cut in the direction gj A, accompanied with fat, and the other all 
lean, in a tine from t to k. The parts above the shank are coarse 
and dry ; but yet some prefer this to the rich and more juicy parts. 

Jl Saddle ofMtOttm. 

This is by some called a chine of mutton, and consists of the two 
loins together, the back-bone running down the middle of the tail. 
When you carve it you must cut a long slice in either of the fleshy 
parts, on the side of the back-bone, in the direction a, 6. There is 
seldom any great length of tail lefl on, but if it is sent up with the tail, 
many will be fond of it, and it may be easily divided into several 
pieces, by cutting between the joints of the tail, which are about an 
inch apart. 

A Cod's Head. 

Fish in general requires very little carving, the fleshy parts being 
those principally esteemed. A cod's head and shoulders, when in 
season, and properly boiled, is a veiy genteel and handsome dish. 
When cut, it should be done with a spoon fish-trowel, and the parts 
about the back-bone on the shoulders are the most firm and best 
Take ofl*a piece quite down to the bone, in the direction ci, 6, c, d^ 
putting in the spoon at ci, c, and with each slice offish give a piece 
of the round, which lies underneath the back-bone and lines it, the 
meat of which is thin, and a little darker coloured than the body of 
the fish itself, this may be got by passing a knife or spoon underneath, 
in the direction tl^f. About the head are many delicate parts, some 
fine kernels, and a great deal of the jelly kind. The jelly parts lie 
about the jaw bones, and the firm parts within the head. Some are 
fond of the palate, and others the tongue, which likewise may be got, 
by putting a spoon into the mouth, in the direction of the line e. 

A Piece of Boiled Salmon, 

Tub fattest and richest part of salmon is the belly ; it is therefore 
customary to give to those who like both, a thin slice of each ; the 
one cut out of the belly in the direction r, r/, the other out of the back 
in the line /i, h. Most people who are fond of salmon generally like 
the skin, so that the slices must be cut thin with the skin on. 

A Mackarel. 

Slit the fish all along the back in the line fi, p, 6, and take off* the 
whole side, as far as the line 6, r, not too near the head, as the meat 



S58 cA&Tiko. 

aborelfae gills is generally black, and ill flavoured. The roe of a mala 
fish is soft, bat timt of the female is hard, and full of small eggs. 

A Calf's Head. 

In carving this, begin bv cutting the flesh quite along the cheek 
bone> in the direction c, 6, from whence several handsome slices may 
be taken. In the fleshy part, at the end of the jaw-bone, lies part of 
the throat-sweet-bread, which may be cut into, in the line c, </, aad 
which is esteemed the best part in the head. Many like the eye, 
which is to be cut from its socket a, by forcing the point of the knife 
down to the bottom of one edge of the socket, and cutting quite 
round, keeping the point of the knife slanting towards the middle, so 
as to separate the meat from the bone. The palate is also reckoned 
by some very delicate : it lies on the under side of the roof of the 
mouth ; is a wrinkled, white, thick skin, ;Emd may be easily separated 
from the bone by a knife, by raising the head with your left hand. 
There is also some nice tender bits on the under side, covering the 
under jaw, and some delicately gristly fat to be pared ofi* about the 
ear, g. In the upper-jaw is the large tooth behind, which, having se- 
veral cells, and being full of j.elly, is called the sweet-tooth ; but its 
delicacy is more in the name than any thing else. When you serve 
any person with a slice of the head, you must inquire whether they 
choose to have any of the tongue and brains, which are generally 
served up in a separate dish. A slice from the thick part of the 
tongue, near the root, is the best 

Leg x>f Mutton. 

A tEG of wether Mutton, which is by far the best flavoured, may 
be readily known by the kernel, or little round lump of fat, just above 
the letters a, e. This joint, whether boiled or roasted, is carved in 
the same manner. The person who does this business should turn 
the joint towards him as it here lies, the shank to the left hand ; then 
holding it steady with his fork, he should cut it deep on the fleshy 
part, in the hollow of the thigh, quite to the bone, in the direction 
0, 6. Then will he cut it right through the kernel of fat called the 
papers eye, of which many are particularly fond. The most juicy 
parts of the leg are in the thick part of it, from the liue a, 6, upward, 
towards e ; but many prefer the drier part, about the shank or 
knuckle, which some call the venison part, from its eating so short ; 
but this is certainly the coarsest part of the joint. The fat lies 
chiefly on the ridges <?, e, and is to be cut in the directron f>,/. la 
order to cut out what is by some called the cramp-bone, and by others 
the gentleman's bone, you must take hold of the shank-bone with 
your left hand, and cutting down to the thigh-bone at the point d, 
then passing the knife under the cramp-bone, in the direction dy r, it 
may easily be cut out. 

•4 Ham. 

A HAM is cut two ways, either across in the line />, r, or in the cir- 
cular^ne in the middle, taking out a small piece as at n, and cutting 
thin slices in a circular direction, thus enlarging it by degrees. This
