Foreword 

WHENEVER an economic condi- 
tion arises that necessitates a 
radical change from customs that 
have become firmly fixed through long 
usage, there is naturally considerable 
confusion before the proper balance is 
attained. 

Thus it is in war days, when our 
country calls upon its housewives to con- 
serve the food supply by general econo- 
my and by using substitutes for the 
foods most vitally needed by its fighting 
men and Allies. Many are not wisely 
economic. Some not enough, some too 
extreme. 

The Philadelphia Record, in publish- 
ing this War-Time Cook Book, hopes to 
so instruct that we may all help to the 
fullest measure in the conservation of 
food, with the least deprivation to 
ourselves. 

Mrs. Nevada Davis Hitchcock, author 
of this book, is a recognized expert in 
Food and Home Economics. A graduate 
of Oberlin College, Mrs. Hitchcock be- 
came interested in Home Economics 
years ago, when this subject first re- 
ceived serious consideration as a science 
— following at that time the leadership 
of Mrs. Richards. She is a scientist in 
every phase of the food problem, from

production, through its distribution, 
selection and preparation, with par- 
ticular training in conservation. She 
studied Child Psychology under the 
late Dr. Huey, of Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, and is a real housewife with a 
family to look after. 

She is at present instructor in Mar- 
keting and Household Administration, 
at Temple University ; — State Chairman 
of Home Economics of the National 
League for Women's Service; — Chair- 
man of the Food and Home Economics 
Committee of the Civic Club ; — and was 
Director of Food Conservation for 
Philadelphia Council of National De- 
fense, until recently, when pressure of 
other work forced her to resign. 

Mrs. Hitchcock has for years been the 
Domestic Science Expert of The Phila- 
delphia Record. Thousands of her read- 
ers have voluntarily written to express 
their appreciation of her splendid 
menus and wonderful household helps.

WAR-TIME THRIFT 

THRIFT means the practice of 
economy based upon good man- 
agement. It means saving, but 
not stinginess; frugality, but not 
parsimony. It means getting value 
for every dollar spent, for time and 
energy expended. It is the necessary 
foundation of lasting prosperity. 

The great struggle that we are en- 
gaged in now makes the practice of 
thrift doubly pressing. We must make 
the wisest use of our food stuffs to 
feed our men, our allies and our fami- 
lies. We must use our money to the 
best advantage — that is, we must se- 
lect carefully everything that comes 
into our homes, measured by its true 
value and what it contributes to our 
real needs. We should be willing to 
give up cheerfully useless luxuries 
until the war is over. One bright 
thought that brightens the dark cloud 
of the struggle for democracy is that 
— the principles of true thrift may 
become firmly fixed through patriot- 
ism, so that in the future the Ameri- 
can family will no longer be held up 
as an example of extravagance, but 
stand out clearly as a pattern of wise 
economy which brings prosperity. 

In order to practice real thrift, one 
must study home-making as one does 
a profession or a business. One must 
make use of science and the principles 
of economics. That is, one must try 
to find out and put into practice the 
results of scientific experiment, the 
laws of efficiency, the conservation of 
energy, time and material. It is the 
purpose of this little book to point out 
some of the ways that home-makers 
can do this.

GOOD TOOLS 
NECESSARY 

Some of the essentials that one 
must have in the kitchen in order to 
use time and strength to the best ad- 
vantage in cookery are as enumerated 
below : 

Kitchen Furniture 

There shotild be proper kitchen fur- 
niture, which includes a good kitchen 
cupboard, table or kitchen cabinet, 
good range, either gas or coal (pre- 
ferably both) , well-placed sink, stool, 
low chair and an ordinary kitchen 
chair. The table should be on casters 
so that it can be moved to any part of 
the kitchen where work is being done, 
or when a strong light is necessary. 
The top of the table should be either 
zinc or granite. Kitchen cabinets 
should be selected with a view to the 
arrangement of receptacles for foods 
and utensils, and also with a view to 
cleanliness and sanitation. 

Kitchen Utensils 

There are certain utensils which 
should be in every kitchen if one is 
to secure the best results. The most 
important of these are: A bread 
mixer, food grinder, measuring cups 
and spoons, egg beaters (one large 
and one small), can opener, cork 
screws, soup strainers, good paring 
and carving knives and whetstone. 
This also includes different sized pans 
and kettles, also pans of various 
depths for broiling, baking and saute- 
ing, i. e., shallow pans and deep pans ; 
mixing bowls, steamer, fireless cooker 
and portable oven; asbestos mat for 
gas stoves. It is a good plan for each 
housewife to study the needs of her 
family and to buy her utensils accord- 
ingly, so that she will have no "dead 
timber" in her kitchen, that is, 
things that she uses but once or twice

THE PHIUDELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

a year. The articles enumerated 
above are those which have come into 
my own kitchen as a result of over 
20 years' experience in housekeeping. 
If I were to refurnish my kitchen to- 
morrow, I would want every one of 
these articles, and other articles that 
every housewife must have, such as 
a cake turner, cookie cutters, etc. 

Having necessary kitchen furnish- 
ings is the first step toward good 
management, but it is equally impor- 
tant to have these things systemati- 
cally arranged and in order. The old 
rule was — a place for everything and 
everything in its place. The new rule 
is — the proper place for each article 
and always in place. One may have 
a place for the egg beater, for in- 
stance, and always put it in its place, 
but if it is in the back part of the cup- 
board on the far side of the kitchen, 
it is not in the right place because it 
takes too much time and effort to get 
it when needed and to return it to its 
place. Articles used daily should be 
placed where they can be reached and 
returned with the fewest possible mo- 
tions. For that reason the kitchen 
furniture should be grouped on the 
same principle. The sink, the table, 
the range and the cupboard should be 
as near each other as it is possible to 
place them. It may be necessary to 
have the kitchen table in the centre of 
the room; that is why casters are a 
distinct advantage. The table may be 
moved to one side when the ironing 
board, for instance, needs to be placed 
in a good light or near the Source of 
heat. 

A convenient arrangement is to 
have shelves in the kitchen for small 
articles used daily. A small shelf 
placed over or near the range makes 
it possible to have the coffee and tea 
pots, salt box, pepper and paprika 
shakers, onion and celery salts, the 
tea caddy, matches and holders for 
hot kettles and pans, where they can 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— ylZi^a^s Reliable 

7 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

be reached without moving from the 
stove. A second shelf over the sink 
is convenient for holding measuring 
cups, colanders, strainers, chopping 
knife, the whetstone, bowls and jars. 
This should have hooks on the edge 
and underneath to hang up such 
things as egg beaters, coffee and tea 
strainers, can openers, egg whisk, la- 
dles and pot scrapers. The sink should 
have a drain board, of course, a dish 
drainer, the soap shaker, soap dishes 
and a can of cleanser. 

The same rule of having things at 
hand applies to standard supplies and 
utensils in the kitchen cupboard or 
cabinet. Those used oftenest must be 
nearest at hand, in front of the things 
used less often. That is, the articles 
and the foods must be so arranged 
that one does not have to shift and 
lift up things only used occasionally 
in order to get the utensils or foods 
used frequently. Cereals, for instance, 
which are used every day, should be 
placed nearest the kitchen table. Nuts 
and raisins, used occasionally, placed 
farthest away. This illustration is just 
used as an example of how to plan 
arrangement in the cupboard. The 
same thing is true in placing 
cutlery and other small articles in 
the kitchen drawer. Paring knives, 
measuring spoons and things used 
constantly should be in front of the 
drawer. The cake turner, butter cur- 
ler and muffin rings at the back of 
the drawer.

FOOD SELECTION 

In order to choose foods wisely, one 
must know three things : 1. What 
foods do in the body. 2. How much 
food each person needs. 3. What foods 
to serve at the same meal. 



Food Values 

Foods are needed in the body for 
three main things. 

I. Body builders. 

These are proteins and mineral 
salts which furnish material for blood, 
bone, muscle, nerve and other tissues. 
Foods doing this are milk, eggs, meat, 
fish, cheese, beans, peas, lentils, some 
nuts and cereals. 

II. Energy or work and heat pro- 

ducers. 
These furnish fuel. Foods of this 
kind are fats from oil, cream, bacon, 
butter, fat meats and nuts. Carbo- 
hydrates also belong to this class and 
are found in cereals, rice, potatoes, 
other starchy vegetables, sugar, 
honey, sweet dried foods (figs, dates, 
etc.). 

III. Body regulators. 

Mineral matter, water, cellulose or 
fibre are necessary to regulate the pro- 
cesses of secretion, digestion, absorp- 
tion, elimination and the like, keeping 
the blood and other fluids normal. 
Some of the most important sources 
of mineral matter are phosphorus 
from milk and cream, yolk of eg^, 
meat, oat meal, dried peas and beans. 
Iron comes from above list and also 
from spinach, raisins and prunes. Cel- 
lulose is found in various foods, such 
as fruits, vegetables and grain prod- 
ucts, and is necessary to furnish bulk 
which one must have in order to get 
best action in digestive tract.

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Amount of Food Necessary 

To decide upon the amount of daily 
food necessary for each individual one 
must know : 1. How to measure food 
values. 2. How much the individual 
requires. 

The value of food is calculated 
by the amount of energy it yields 
to the body. This energy is calculated 
by measuring the amount of heat pro- 
duced when the food is burned. Fuel 
is burned in an engine, heat is pro- 
duced, also energy to work. Food used 
in the human body or machine pro- 
duces energy to work and heat for the 
body. By means of a wonderful ma- 
chine called the calorimeter, scientists 
have been able to register what food 
does in the body. The measuring unit 
or measure is called the calorie (the 
root of which means heat) . It is the 
fuel value measure for food just as 
pint is for volume and ounce a unit 
for weight. The calorie is the amount 
of heat necessary to raise one pound 
of water 4 degrees Fahrenheit. Know- 
ing how much heat has been produced, 
scientists can tell how much energy 
this amount of food will produce. 
They use the term calorie to measure 
this energy as it corresponds to the 
heat measure. 

In order to have an easy way for 
home-makers and the average indi- 
vidual to compute the necessary calo- 
ries, a number of authorities are 
adopting the 100-calorie portion as a 
basis. Knowing these portions and 
also understanding how many calories 
are necessary, it is not so difficult for 
anyone to learn to eat wisely and well. 

To decide how much food each per- 
son needs daily one must keep in mind 
the total amount of food necessary 
and also the amount of protein neces- 
sary for growth and maintenance. To 
determine how much is necessary de- 
pends upon muscular activity, age and 
sex primarily, though size, season and 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

10 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

climate also affect this. An active per- 
son requires more than one sitting 
most of the time. In cold weather 
more food is necessary than in warm 
— ^just as one needs wool in winter 
and cotton in summer. The follow- 
ing table will give some idea of the 
requirements for one day: 

Calories. 

Child from 2 to 6 1200-1800 

Child from 6 to 15 1800-2500 

Man at light work 2500-2800 

Woman at light work 1800-2400 

Man at moderate work . . . 3000-3500 
Woman at moderate work . 2400-2800 
Man at very hard work . . . 4000-5000 
Woman at very hard work 3400-4400 

Aged man 1800-2000 

Aged woman 1600-1800 

Measuring Food by the 100 
Calories 

The calorie, as was explained, is a 
heat unit used to express the corre- 
sponding work unit that different 
kinds of food give. By putting a 
number of foods into the 100-calorie 
class, it is easy to get sufficient knowl- 
edge to select the amount of food 
necessary to cover all of our needs. 
For example, one slice of bread equals 
100 calories; one pat of butter, or 
three-quarters of a cupful of milk, or 
the lean meat of a lamb chop, or one 
slice of bacon has a value of 100 calo- 
ries. These units or multiples of 
units represent very closely the 
amount ordinarily taken at one serv- 
ing, so that the food can readily be 
served . according to this plan. It is 
an easy way to fix food values in the 
memory. Sufficient information can 
be given in a short conversation to 
enable a person to raise or lower his 
diet 500 or 600 calories daily, which 
is an amount sufficient to cause a gain 
or loss in weight, as desired. 

For the benefit of housewives who 
are trying to feed their families in

the best way possible, a list of foods 
and their values in the 100 calorie 
basis is given. Here is a list of foods

In using the 100-calorie in deciding 
how much food one uses there is one 
danger that I wish to point out, and 
that is while you can use the 100- 
calorie as a measure of fuel you must 
understand that all foods which have 
an equal fuel value are not equally 
valuable in other respects. You must 
know what amount of protein, fat and 
carbohydrates each food has, what 
bulk or cellulose, how it is assimilat- 
ed, how much mineral matter and 
valuable salts, how much water and 
what growth promoting elements are 
present. It is not enough to know, 
for instance, that one slice of bacon 
has 100 calories and then proceed to 
eat six slices of bacon for breakfast, 
10 for luncheon and 20 for dinner to 
make up the necessary 2600 calories. 
Even if you could do it you would 
not be sufl[iciently fed, because bacon 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— i4/a;ays Reliable 

13 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

is 94 per cent, fat and you must have 
a certain amount of protein and car- 
bohydrates. Potatoes, on the other 
hand, furnish too much starch. That 
is the reason we need butter, bacon 
or oleo with potatoes. The value of 
the 100-calorie portion Hes in the fact 
that by knowing the predominating 
element, i. e., fat, carbohydrate and 
protein, we can select with ease a 
balanced ration. For example, break- 
fast: 

Calories. 
One large apple, carbohydrate 
predominating 100 

Two slices of bread, protein, fat 
and carbohydrates 200 

One cup oatmeal, protein, fat and 
carbohydrates 100 

% cup milk, protein, fat (less 
carbohydrates) 100 

One egg, protein, fat (no car- 
bohydrates) 100 

One pat butter, almost no pro- 
tein, 99 per cent, fat, no car- 
bohydrates 100 

One tablespoonful sugar, no pro- 
tein, no fat, 100 per cent, car- 
bohydrates 50 

Total 750 

This is the right proportion for a 
woman at active work. 

In the above list milk is the one 
food where the protein, fat and car- 
bohydrates are the most evenly di- 
vided. Sugar has all carbohydrates. 
One can see at a glance that to in- 
crease the number of calories along 
the right basis would be to eat more 
bread, cereal or egg rather than but- 
ter or sugar, although these would 
give the required amount of calories. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— >4/u;a>'s Reliable

THE PH IL ADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Food Grouping 

In understanding food values and 
the groups to which they belong, it is 
not difficult to arrange them properly 
if one keeps in mind that one must 
have body builders (see previous chap- 
ter), energy furnishers and body 
regulators. 

Special points to remember are 
that in carbohydrates, both starch and 
sugar must be used, but that there 
should be more starchy foods than 
sweet foods. Children should have 
plenty of milk and eggs for their 
growth-promoting qualities. Many 
foods, moreover, are valuable for more 
than one thing, as milk, for instance, 
is an excellent source of both fat and 
carbohydrate (in the form of sugar) , 
as well as protein. Eggs furnish fat, 
iron and protein. Macaroni, though 
classed as starch, supplies consider- 
able protein. 

By using the above suggestions, 
one can plan the meal according 
to the amount of muscular activity, 
beginning with meals proper for 
those at light work, moderate work, 
active work and hard work, making 
four groups in all. By choosing from 
these groups, the proper amount of 
nourishment is furnished. One point 
to keep in mind, however, is that it is 
never wise to use two foods rich in 
the same quality at the same meal. 
For example, potatoes and rice are 
rich in starch. If one has rice, then 
the potatoes should be omitted. Dried 
peas and dried beans have a high pro- 
tein content. With these little or no 
meat should be used. Milk is such a 
well-balanced food that when a great 
deal of it is used, one may combine it 
with small amounts of other foods. 
As, for instance, a small amount of 
cheese or meat or eggs in creamed 
dishes. 

THE PHILADELPHIA ^ECOKD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOCK 

Vitamines 

It has been found by scientific ex- 
periment that a certain element of 
food is necessary to promote the 
growth of children and to maintain 
health in adults. This substance or 
substances are called vitamines. They 
are not fully understood by scientists, 
but all agree that they are most im- 
portant. 

For some time it was thought that 
one could take proper proportions of 
foods and maintain good health or 
grow steadily. It has been proven, 
however, by analysis, experience and 
observation that one may take the 
proper amount of protein, fat, carbo- 
hydrates and mineral matter and at 
the same time lose flesh or dwindle 
away unless a food containing 
vitamines is in the diet. 

Fortunately the amount of vita- 
mines taken in the daily diet does not 
have to be great and they are not 
difficult to get. For instance, a child 
suffering for lack of vitamines often 
will experience a wonderful change in 
a short time if given a few spoonfuls 
of fresh milk, or orange juice or 
lemon juice as the physician may ad- 
vise. Lack of vitamines is one reason 
why condensed milk is not a good food 
for little children. Fresh milk fur- 
nishes the best possible food. Butter 
also is good food for children because 
it contains vitamines. Butterine is a 
good food for grown people, as they 
can get enough vitamines from other 
sources. Fresh fruits and vegetables 
furnish them abundantly. Eggs, ce- 
reals, beef, peas and beans also have 
abundant vitamines. If grown people 
eat a varied diet including fruit and 
other vegetables besides potatoes they 
will get all the vitamines they need. 
If children have good milk, eggs, 
butter, fruit and vegetables they will 
have vitamines enough to make them 
grow splendidly.

This is a high fuel value meal. A 
man ordinarily active would need 200

by reducing the amount of oatmeal 
and cutting out the potato. 



Marketing 

While the market basket is not a 
weapon that will do much to reduce 
the high cost of living, it is a factor 
that will help to secure the best pos- 
sible food for the family. It is be- 
coming more and more fashionable to 
carry one's market basket and go to 
the market, a practice the wise home- 
maker should encourage. By market 
is meant any place where all kinds of 
foods are sold. The advantages in 
going out and selecting one's food in 
person, are that fresh vegetables and 
fruits as well as fresh poultry, meat 
and fish may be secured more readily ; 
there is opportunity to secure the 
best that is offered for sale; one can 
select exactly the kind needed for the 
individual family; beside a greater 
opportunity to have variety in the 
family meals. 

The woman who markets in per- 
son is able to take advantage of any 
bargains that arise from a large stock 
of one kind of foods. For instance, a 
large consignment of cabbage may 
have come in, which makes it neces- 
sary to sell cabbage much cheaper for 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /4/u;a>'s Reliable 

V 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

a few days. Then there are always 
special sales arranged in different 
markets. By taking advantage of 
these, she is able to save considerable 
money. Every one should make it a 
point to buy seasonable goods, that is, 
to buy foods which are grown locally 
and are cheapest and best when they 
are ripe. Such products fluctuate in 
price, according to weather and sea- 
son, and it is only by going to market 
that one can profit through buying 
them when they are at their very 
best. 

The telephone has a legitimate 
place in marketing, principally, how- 
ever, for the ordering of staple 
goods and groceries, and for times 
w^hen it is impossible for the house- 
mother to do her marketing in per- 
son. The abuse of the 'phone for hap- 
hazard ordering should be resolutely 
discouraged by all housewives. It 
should be looked upon as an untidy 
and unreliable habit of mind to order 
groceries every day or several times 
a day. It also is unpatriotic, because 
the extra deliveries take men and 
vehicles,, which otherwise might be 
placed at the disposal of the Govern- 
ment. The housewife who knows her 
business does not think of ordering 
standard goods more than once a 
week, and perishable products more 
than twice, unless some most unex- 
pected development occurs, which 
will disturb the system and order of 
her household management. 

Checking Up Weights and 
Measures 

Accurate scales are a necessary 
part of the kitchen equipment, in 
order to check up the purchases' 
made. One should weigh and measure 
the foods that come into the house 
frequently, in order to see that the 
right weight and measure have been 
given. This is done, not because one 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

distrusts the grocer or the dealer, but 
to discover mistakes. In order to do 
this, every bill sent with the goods 
should have plainly marked upon it, 
not only the pounds, but the ounces. 
This is necessary because if a mistake 
has been made, it can be rectified, but 
if meat is marked, as for instance, 
beef $1.75, and one does not know the 
pounds and ounces, one cannot tell 
whether a mistake has been made or 
not. Even if the pounds are given — 
four pounds plus or four pounds 
minus, there is no way to find out just 
how much was sent. In buying meats, 
also, all the trimmings should be sent 
home, because these are necessary to 
add to the weight of the meat in order 
to find just how much was bought. 

Many housewives also need to learn 
the value of fractions and to become 
proficient in mental arithmetic. That 
• is, they should know how to count in 
ounces and quarts. It is much easier 
to know just what the price should 
be if one remembers always that — 

4 ounces equal one-quarter pound. 
8 ounces equal one-half pound. 
12 ounces equal three-quarters of a 
pound. 

16 ounces equal one pound. 

If your dealer continues to make 
mistakes and you finally are convinced 
that he is dishonest, and not merely 
careless, you should report him at 
once to the Bureau of Weights and 
Measures. Moreover, you must learn 
that liquid measure and dry measure 
cannot be used indiscriminately. If 
your dealer is using a liquid measure 
to measure out such things as pota- 
toes, apples and tomatoes, he is not 
giving you full measure, and he also 
should be reported.

FOOD CONSERVATION 

Much depends upon the proper care 
of foods after they reach the home. 
They may be ever so fresh when they 
come into the kitchen, but if they are 
allowed to stand there regardless of 
their perishable character, they are 
not only impaired in flavor, but often 
show an appreciable loss in quality 
through shrinkage. All green vege- 
tables or other perishable products 
should be placed in a cool receptacle 
or room, as soon as possible. Every- 
thing like spinach, lettuce, cress or 
similar greens, should be washed and 
placed in paper bags or clean cheese- 
cloth, put in the refrigerator or the 
coolest place in the house. Cereals and 
standard products, which are liable to 
be bothered by insects, are best kept 
in jars ; glass jars with glass tops and 
with rubber rings are fine for this 
purpose, because they not only keep 
out weevils, ants and such things, 
but show what they contain. Meat 
must be kept in a cool place, also, and 
if it is wrapped in waxed paper when 
sent from the dealer, it is better to 
keep that paper around the meat until 
one is ready to use it. Butter and 
milk both attract to themselves odors 
of all kinds, and for that reason should 
be placed where they are free from 
contaminating influence. It is never 
wise to put fish or cabbage near them ; 
in fact, the last mentioned articles 
should not be placed in the refrigera- 
tor at all, unless in tightly sealed 
jars or dishes. 

Canning and Drying 

Canning and drying are of great- 
importance in conserving foods. This 
subject will be taken up later in re- 
gard to the regular operations of can- 
ning and drying; it is well to note 
here that small portions of foods may 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— i4/u;a>'s Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

be saved in this way. As, for in- 
stance, when a jar of vegetables or 
fruit has been opened, and only part 
used, one may heat the remainder and 
seal in a sterilized jar. For this rea- 
son it is well to have pint and half- 
pint jars at hand. The outside leaves 
of cabbage, stalks of celery, pieces of 
carrot and onion may be sliced thin 
and dried in a pan lined with paper, 
and placed in a jar or box to use as 
seasoning for soups and cream 
sauces. 



Buying in Quantities 

It is a much discussed question as 
to whether one saves money by buy- 
ing in large quantities. The home- 
maker must look over her available 
storeroom and decide how she could 
take care of things in quantity before 
she makes any large purchases. This 
applies particularly to vegetables, 
such as potatoes, celery, cabbage and 
onions, because these wither if they 
are kept where it is warm and dry, 
and they sprout if they are kept where 
it is warm and moist. One must have 
a cool, dry place to keep such articles 
of food properly. If not kept properly, 
the waste that necessarily comes will 
more than offset the profit of buying 
in large quantities. Even in buying 
standard foods like cereals, one must 
consider the room for storage. They 
must be kept where insects, mice and 
rats cannot get at them. If they are 
kept in a moist place they will mould. 
As the average house does not have 
a great deal of storeroom that is cool 
and dry, it is difficult to buy in large 
quantities to advantage unless there 
is a large family. Another point to 
be considered is that there must be 
a very careful apportionment in buy- 
ing in large quantities, as there is a 
tendency to use more than necessary, 
just because the food is at hand. Buy- 
ing in very small quantities has dis- 
advantages, too, because there is the 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

21 



THE PHILADE L PHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

increased number of orders, extra de- 
liveries or errands, as well as losing 
the profit that comes from buying in 
moderate quantities. For instance, one 
may often find a package 10c. straight 
or three for a quarter. This means a 
decided saving. Again there are two 
packages for 25c. and one package for 
13c. or 15c. Sugar usually comes two 
pounds for an integral price and one 
pound with a fraction. That is, two 
pounds for 17c., for instance, one 
pound for 8I/2C. In buying the one 
pound one must pay 9c., losing the 
one-half cent. 

Refrigeration 

Keeping food at a low temperature 
is the result of scientific experiment, 
because germs and bacteria do not 
thrive in a cool place. They may live 
there, but they do not multiply as they 
would in a warm, moist place. The 
colder the temperature, the fewer the 
germs (provided the refrigerator is 
kept clean). For that reason in buy- 
ing a refrigerator, it is well to take 
the precaution of knowing how the 
walls of the refrigerator are packed 
and how the refrigerator is put to- 
gether. A reliable firm will always 
explain to you just how deep the walls 
of the refrigerator are and with what 
kind of packing they are filled. A 
cheap, poorly made refrigerator may 
cost less in the beginning, but it is 
much dearer in the end, because you 
not only pay more for the ice con- 
stantly, but also lose part of your food 
through poor refrigeration. 

It is impossible, of course, to keep 
all the food in the refrigerator. Much 
can be done to conserve food by segre- 
gation. That is, by keeping it from 
touching other foods, either by placing- 
it in jars, crocks or kettles, or by 
wrapping it in wax or tissue paper. A 
head of cabbage, which has been part- 
ly used, may be kept for some time if 
the remaining part is wrapped in wax 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

22 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



paper as soon as it has been cut. But- 
ter may be kept for some time if it is 
placed in a thoroughly sterilized crock 
or jar and covered with water. 

The care of the refrigerator or the 
dishes in which food is kept is most 
important, if one wishes to get the 
full value of the money expended for 
foods. There should be a daily inspec- 
tion of the refrigerator, not only to 
see that there is absolute cleanliness, 
but also to make the best use of left- 
overs in planning the meals. If the 
refrigerator is not kept absolutely 
clean (washed with soap and water 
and thoroughly rinsed, at least once 
a week, with a daily attention to wip- 
ing off any food that may have been 
spilled on the walls or bottom of the 
refrigerator) the food will not only 
be poor in flavor, but it may be con- 
taminated with germs, which will 
produce disease. If one knows just 
what is in the refrigerator, one may 
be able to use the remnants of foods 
to the best advantage, either putting 
them together in some one dish or 
combining them with other foods.

CONSERVATION OF FUEL 

Scarcity of coal has pressed a les- 
son home to many housewives. It is 
absolutely necessary to get the full 
use of every bit of fuel v^^e have, 
whether this be coal, gas or electric- 
ity. In order to do this every house- 
wife must study her own range, and 
see how she can cook with the least 
amount of fuel. The very first point 
to remember as the best way to save 
fuel, is not to use it. For instance, 
one must plan to use the range to the 
fullest capacity each time and then 
let it rest. Plan the meals so that 
the greatest amount of cooking may 
be done at one time. For instance, 
when baking and using the oven, bake 
as many dishes as possible, even 
though these dishes are not neces- 
sarily for use that day. They may 
be reheated with very little trouble 
and fuel, when wanted. The same 
thing applies to boiling. Of course, 
one must understand to regulate the 
drafts and dampers in a coal range 
and the burners for gas or electricity. 

Taking up the subject of the coal 
range, the first thing to remember is 
that one must not heap up the coal in 
the range to the fullest capacity, then 
open the drafts and let the fire go 
until it is red hot before trying to 
check it. This is wrong for two rea- 
sons. First, to get the best results 
from your fuel you should not put 
your coal above the top of the oven. 
Second, if you let your fire burn until 
it is raging with a red-hot stove top, 
you cannot check it to any advantage. 
It has such a start that it will keep on 
burning rapidly. As soon as you have 
a good fire, well started, look to your 
drafts; see that the lower drafts are 
closed, and if your fire continues to 
burn rapidly, open your top drafts 
and check it in the pipe. The woman 
who pays no attention to the drafts 
or dampers in her coal range will 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

24 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

burn twice as much coal as the woman 
who studies the drafts of her range, 
checks it before the fire is raging, also 
sees that the drafts are all closed be- 
. fore she leaves the stove at mealtime. 

When using a gas range, never turn 
on the gas until the match is lighted. 
Then, when boiling anything, turn 
down the light until it is just high 
enough to keep the kettle boiling, be- 
cause after the water begins to boil 
it cannot be heated to any greater de- 
gree. You may have your fire on full, 
but you will only be wasting your 
gas. The same care refers to the gas 
oven when baking. 

Of course, one must heat the oven 
before the food is put into it, and 
there are certain rules to remember 
about that. For a quick oven light 
both burners about 10 minutes be- 
fore needed. For a moderate oven 
have both burners half on for the 
same period. Then when putting the 
food into the oven, one should remem- 
ber that in baking bread and cakes 
the burners should be turned down 
right away; in baking meats "after 10 
or 15 minutes the burners should be 
turned down. In baking, custards, 
bread, cakes and similar things, one 
may turn out the burners entirely 10 
or 15 minutes before the cooking is 
complete. Some prefer, in baking 
cake, to turn out the burners for 10 
minutes as soon as the cake has been 
put in. Then, after that period, re- 
light the burners and turn them low. 
In baking anything, remember to turn 
out the burners before taking out the 
dishes in the oven. It is a distinct 
waste of gas or electricity to have 
the burners going for two or three 
minutes after the food has been re- 
moved. In boiling one should remem- 
ber to turn off the burner before the 
kettle is removed from the fire. These 
are small points, but if they are al- 
ways kept in mind a considerable sav- 
ing of fuel will ensue. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— yl/u;a>'s Reliable 



THE PHILA D ELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

In addition to knowing how to 
regulate the draft and the burners, 
one should make a study of devices 
that will save fuel. The very best 
one, of course, is the fireless cooker. 
This is not only a fuel saver, but a 
time and labor saver as well, and no 
housewife should be without one. 
Next to this comes the portable oven, 
which may be set over one burner, 
and in this way an entire meal may 
be cooked — a roast with potatoes in 
the pan may be cooked on the lower 
shelf, a pudding and a vegetable on 
the second shelf. If you have never 
tried baking your beets and carrots 
you should experiment. They are 
much sweeter cooked that way and 
none of the mineral matter is lost. A 
steamer also saves fuel in the same 
way. Every bit of the meal may be 
cooked over one burner of the gas or 
coal oil stove. One may have a meat 
dish, potatoes, green vegetable, pud- 
ding or fruit steamed at the same 
time. Such vegetables as dandelions, 
spinach, celery or asparagus are much 
better steamed than boiled, and then 
again all the mineral is saved, not a 
bit passes out through the drain pipe 
of the kitchen sink, because there is 
no liquid to be thrown away. 

In the winter time when one has the 
coal range in the kitchen for heating 
purposes as well as cooking purposes, 
one should make use of the oven to 
the best advantage all the time. 
Fruits and vegetables that will re- 
quire long cooking, such as dried peas, 
beans and cereals like oatmeal and 
hominy, may be cooked in the oven 
at any time by putting them in a cas- 
serole or earthen dish with a cover 
and letting them cook over night and 
all day. These are but a few points 
to remember in fuel conservation.. 
The woman who wishes to do her 
duty will experiment for herself.

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



FOOD PREPARATION 

Good Recipes 

One of the necessary factors in pre- 
paring attractive, nutritious meals is 
to have a collection of good recipes. 
By good recipes is meant recipes 
which are accurate in measurement, 
simple in arrangement and full 
enough to give the necessary infor- 
mation in regard to the different steps 
taken in preparing the dishes. 

Careful Measurement 

The vital point is accurate measure- 
ment. It is possible for some good 
cooks to prepare meals without meas- 
suring the ingredients carefully, but 
if the history of the family were told 
accurately, one would find that some- 
times the dishes vary in appearance 
and taste. The experienced cook does, 
of course, become so familiar with 
measuring foods that she can almost 
tell the exact measurement, yet at 
times she will make a mistake with 
the result that the food, while it may 
be good, has not reached its full per- 
fection. For that reason all measure- 
ments should be exact and level. It 
is not possible always to measure by 
the eye a rounded table or teaspoon 
of baking powder or soda; butter the 
size of an egg or walnut does not 
mean the same thing to all minds. For 
that reason it is best to go by the level 
measure. 

A second point about new recipes is 
that the wording should be plain so 
that it cannot be misunderstood. If 
you do not quite understand the man- 
ner and you do not know that it is a 
tested recipe, it is better to use a small 
quantity in trial, lest the whole 
amount of food be wasted. When one 
has made the measurement exact or 
level, then careful attention should 
be paid to directions. See that you 
understood exactly what is said, and 
not what might have been said.

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Planning Meals on Time 

To secure the best results from the 
food and the recipe, as well as the 
truest economy of time and money, 
one should always plan the meals in 
plenty of time. The last minute hur- 
riedly scrambled together meal never 
is satisfactory to the palate nor to the 
pocketbook. By planning the meals 
carefully with a general outline for 
the week, leaving details to be ar- 
ranged every day, one can secure the 
best results. It is impossible to work 
out an exact menu list for every bit 
of food during the entire week, be- 
cause chance visitors or absence of 
the family from some of the meals 
may either increase or decrease the 
food supply on hand. One must 
make use of everything in the house, 
but with the general outline it is quite 
possible to change the daily details, 
so as to use left overs or combinations 
of food. 

It is not only wise to plan the meals 
in time, but they should be started in 
time as well. Breakfast very often 
should be begun the night before and 
dinner early in the morning, when 
foods are to be used which require 
long cooking. A tireless cooker is in- 
valuable for such purpose, but where 
one is not at hand, good use may be 
made of the double boiler, the cas- 
serole or earthen dishes. For in- 
stance, one may start the cereal the 
day before and leave it in the double 
boiler over night, so it just has to be 
warmed up in the morning. One may 
cook cereal or fruit or vegetables, 
such as dried beans or peas, which 
require long cooking in a casserole in 
the oven of the kitchen range in cold 
weather. Apples or prunes cooked in 
this way are particularly delicious. 
They may be put in the night before, 
and be ready for breakfast in the 
morning". Nearly all vegetables are 
better if they have slow cooking. The 
two exceptions to this, however, are 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /l/u^ays Reliable 

28 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

potatoes and cabbage. When cooking 
the meal it is just as important to 
plan when the preparing of the meal 
is to end as when it is to begin. 
That is, one must study the different 
foods to be cooked, so that they will 
come out at the right time for serv- 
ing. Many foods that are cooked and 
then set aside to wait for other things 
to be done lose in appearance and 
flavor. It is best to arrange matters 
so that the things which require long 
cooking can be started, then the table 
may be set, serving dishes arranged, 
salads made ready, dessert prepared 
and the fresh vegetables put on, in 
order that everything will come out 
just right at the same time. This will 
also avoid hurry on the part of the 
one who is preparing the meal, and 
will let her give her full attention to 
each thing in order. 

Menu Making 

Knowing food values, what kind of 
foods to combine and how much to 
select are the first requisites in plan- 
ning the menu. The three things to 
keep in mind are that one must have 
a protein food, a fat, a starchy vege- 
table, a succulent vegetable and a 
sweet, in order to get all the elements 
necessary to give the proper amount 
of fuel to the body. Knowing the 
foods from which these are obtained, 
one may have much more variety in 
the meals served. The following 
menus are given to show some com- 
binations that may be made in fol- 
lowing the above rules:

SERVING THE MEALS 

If we are to get the best results 
from the food we eat we must pay 
attention to the manner in which the 
food is placed upon the table and to 
the habits of the family sitting 
around the table. 

In early times primitive man ate 
alone, in a manner, too, that would 
not appeal to us now. He did that 
because he looked upon every man as 
his enemy. This fear prevailed even 
at the time when the Roman Empire 
dazzled the world with sumptuous en- 
tertainment. Official tasters were 
necessary to show that the food con- 
tained no poison before the guests 
were asked to partake of the feast. 
Religious ceremonies, particularly the 
Feast of Passover, did much to make 
the common table the habit of eating 
together safer, and therefore more 
common. 

Greek civilizatio.., the civilization 
that flowered so wonderfully along 
all lines, had the highest ideas about 
serving and eating meals. They 
followed a very definite order of serv- 
ice and made special provision for 
mental food through the interchange 
of ideas, as one authority says: "The 
supper was so ordered that there was 
convenient time between courses for 
agreeable conversation and at such 
times it was unlawful to mention any 
disastrous circumstances." That last 
statement ought to sink into the 
minds of parents. It should be the 
rule that nothing unpleasant, which 
brings to the mind unpleasant images, 
should be mentioned at the table. 

The family table should be made 
the brightest and best place in the 
home. The family meal should be 
made as attractive as possible, for too 
often it is the only time when all the 
family is together. It is well worth 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /I /tfays Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

while to give attention to the appear- 
ance of the table, to serving the meals 
properly, and to making an effort to 
have one interesting thing at least to 
tell while at the table. Finally there 
must be co-operation between the 
members of the family. Every one 
should try to be on time, to observe 
the small courtesies, and to remain 
through the entire meal. 

The American habits of hurriedly 
bolting food without stopping to chew 
it, of jumping up from the table after 
gobbling down enough food to satisfy 
the pangs of hunger and then grab- 
bing hats and getting out is consid- 
ered a proof of American energy and 
efficiency. There is no loss of time 
at the family table and this seems to 
be something to be proud of instead 
of being, as it actually is, a mark of 
selfishness and a menace to the 
health. All our scientists agree now 
that digestion is best accomplished 
when the food is eaten slowly and 
chewed thoroughly, and when the 
mind is pleasantly occupied. A good 
digestion will do more toward getting 
work done than any amount of hurry 
and scurry. A good digestion is the 
foundation of a good disposition. 

Most women realize in a vague way 
the truth of the above remarks, but 
sometimes the preparation of a meal 
in addition to the other work that has 
to be done leaves little energy for 
serving the meal. Yet a very ordinary 
meal may be made attractive by a 
clean cloth, orderly arrangements of 
knives, forks and spoons and suitable 
dishes. Pretty dishes are made in 
the cheaper grades now, so that no 
one need be without them. A little 
care in handling them will keep them 
free from chips. Tray cloths and 
doilies, which are easier to keep clean, 
may be used instead of tablecloths, 
and even a child may be trained to 
put on the knives, forks and spoons 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /l/u^a^s Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

in the right place and to lay them 
straight. A simple vase of flowers, 
a pot of flowers placed in the centre 
of the table adds much to its appear- 
ance. And one need not go far for 
these. Even a tiny back yard will 
furnish enough flowers for the table 
in summer and keep the ferns grow- 
ing for winter. 

The dining-room itself should be 
made cheerful with a light paper 
such as tan, warm gray or yellow. The 
latter is particularly good for the dark 
dining-rooms that abound in most of 
our cities. Plain, simple furniture, 
with no display of china or silver on 
sideboard, china closet or serving 
table, is an evidence of good taste and 
also is easy to keep clean. 

Where there are servants in the 
home one may well follow the formal 
Russian style and have the plates 
filled by the attendants and brought 
in to the table. But even then this 
style of service is only used for 10- or 
12-course dinners. The rest of the 
time the English service is used, 
which requires that all the plates be 
filled at the table. The usual custom 
is to have a compromise of the Rus- 
sian and English. Some courses are 
served from the kitchen or serving 
table and some from the table. The 
• waitress passes the filled plates. An 
illustration of this style is as follows : 

Chicken Bouillon Croutons 

Olives 

Roast Veal Browned Potatoes 

Spinach Rolls 

Tomato Jelly Salad Cheese Wafers 

Strawberry Shortcake 

Coffee 

The bouillon is brought in cups 
from the kitchen. At the end of that 
course the roast, potatoes and spin- 
ach are placed before the host, who 
fills the plates. The waitress places 
the plates before the guests. 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— yi/i^a^s Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

In the salad course the salad is 
placed on the plates by the hostess. 
The dessert is served from the 
kitchen. 

With the serious conditions that 
confront us on account of the great 
war we are doing with much less serv- 
ice and simplifying our menus. This 
is not only a patriotic duty, but also 
a blessing in disguise. We will have 
more time to enjoy life when we are 
free from so many useless customs. 
For the woman who does her own 
work the service should be simple, of 
course. It is folly to attempt things 
on an elaborate scale. Neither is it 
in good taste even when we are not at 
war. 

The table should be in the centre of 
the room. The cloth should be 
straight and smooth. The silver, nap- 
kin and plate belonging to one cover, 
or for one person, should be placed 
equally distant from the edge of the 
table. This is usually one inch. 

Silver is placed, as a rule, in the 
order in which it is to be used. Two 
exceptions to this rule are the oyster 
fork, which is placed at the right of 
all the silver, and the dinner knife 
and fork, which are placed next to 
the plate. 

If the number of dishes require 
much silver it is best to place the sil- 
ver for the dessert when that is 
served, which will do away with dis- 
playing too much silver at one time. 

The usual cover for each person 
consists of the plate, silver, bread- 
and-butter plate, napkin and glass.- 
These should be placed 20 inches 
apart. When a family dinner is 
served (and all dinners should be in 
this style when the housewife does 
her own cooking) the silver, napkin, 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILA D ELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

glass and bread-and-butter plates are 
placed for the cover. The plates are 
set in front of the head of the family. 

Knives with cutting edge toward 
the plate are laid at the right. 

Forks with tines up are at the left. 
Enough space should be left between 
them for the plate, even if it is not 
there. 

The water glass is at the end of the 
knife. The bread-and-butter plate 
comes at the left, above the forks, 
with the butter spreader either on it 
or at the right of it. 

The napkin should be at the left of 
the forks. 

Salt and pepper shakers should be 
placed between every two covers or 
at the corners of the table. 

Covered asbestos mats for hot 
dishes should be placed in front of 
the server and at each side, according 
to the number of hot dishes, and serv- 
ing spoons, knives and forks should 
be placed near the server. 

Extra silver for the dessert should 
be on a side table near the housewife. 

An important point to keep in 
mind when the housewife cooks and 
serves the meal is to arrange things 
so that she does not have to leave the 
table often when serving the meal. 
If there is a daughter in the home she 
can remove bouillon cups or soup 
plates while the housewife brings in 
the main course. But otherwise it is

THE FIRELESS COOKER 

The fireless cooker has. a real value 
to the busy woman, particularly the 
mother who has to provide for a num- 
ber of rather small children, children 
who cannot help much in superintend- 
ing the cooking. It gives such moth- 
ers an opportunity to go away from 
home feeling safe about the cooking 
and also comfortable in mind in re- 
gard to a good hot meal ready to be 
put on the table without flurry and 
hurry when she comes home from 
shopping. 

There is an economic value, too^ 
for vegetables, cereals and meats 
which require long cooking usually 
are inexpensive unless too much fuel, 
has to be used in cooking them. More 
than that, the slow cooking gives 
many things (especially stews and 
chickens) a particularly good flavor. 
Indeed, slow cooking improves the 
flavor of many things. One may use 
. the fireless cooker for preserving and 
canning. It is well worth while ex- 
perimenting with in summer. 

Cabbage, onions, corned beef, or 
anything else that seems to give a 
strong (and to some unpleasant) odor 
may be cooked without offending deli- 
cate nostrils. The fireless cooker also* 
is a boon to the woman who has to 
use her range in the summer and to> 
the woman who lives in the country 
or suburbs and wishes to be out in 
her garden or looking after the chick- 
ens. She can go out without fearing 
her dinner will boil dry and burn up. 

Originally the fireless cooker idea 
came from Norway, where for many 
years it has been the custom to put 
the pot containing partially cooked 
food into a box and surround it with 
hay or straw in such a way that it 
retains the heat for the longest pos- 
sible time. The cooking goes on and 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— ^l/u^a^s Reliable 

37 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

does in five or six hours or a little 
longer what is done in two or three 
with a higher temperature. Not only 
does this save fuel, but it also pre- 
serves and conserves the juices and 
flavors of the food more than when 
it is cooked on the top of the stove 
or in the oven violently. Herein lies 
all the science involved in the idea. 

But the hay gets broken up from 
continued use and becomes dirty and 
"messy" unless frequently changed. 
Hence the manufactured fireless 
cookers now on the market in this 
country. They depend on exactly the 
same principle as the hay box, but 
they are so made that they can be 
kept clean. More than that, the 
aluminum lining and vessels do not 
rust, and, finally, by having the box 
made entirely of metal it is possible 
to put in it a heated disk, which keeps 
the heat higher and for a longer time, 
until it is possible to roast and even 
to bake bread in the fireless cooker — 
something which was not attempted 
in the hay box. Whether there is any 
saving of fuel in the use of the heated 
disk would probably take scientific 
measurements to determine. 

Farmers' Bulletin No. 771, United 
States Department of Agriculture, 
Washington, D. C, gives full direc- 
tions for making a fireless cooker, and 
has recipes as well. This Bulletin is 
free.

BREAD 

War Bread 

If home-makers are to do their part 
in helping- the Government at this 
critical period, they must use their in- 
genuity in every possible v^^ay to make 
use of other cereals in place of wheat. 

If you bake your bread, use all the 
wheat flour substitutes that you can. 
These are : Corn flour, cornmeal, hom- 
iny, rice, potato and barley flours. 
There are other substitutes, but these 
are the ones that may be obtained in 
our markets. Feterita flour is a 
Hawaiian flour which is used on the 
Pacific coast, as in California. Sweet 
potato flour is used in the South, as is 
also Soy Bean flour, but these flours 
cannot be obtained in any quantity 
here. 

If you use yeast in baking your 
bread, you must have enough wheat 
flour to furnish the gluten necessary 
to make it rise. No other flour except 
rye furnishes that amount of gluten, 
the sticky mass that makes it possible 
to hold the gas bubbles that produce 
light bread. For that reason it is im- 
possible to make a light yeast bread 
of cornmeal, corn flour, rice flour, po- 
tatoes or hominy when used half and 
half, that is — 50-50. You can use one- 
quarter of other flours to three-quar- 
ters wheat flour and have good results 
with yeast. One may even add pota- 
toes, cornmeal and rice to a mixed 
corn flour and wheat flour and secure 
palatable bread, though it will not be 
as light as the three-quarters wheat 
and one-quarter substitute mixture 
produces. In making bread with bak- 
ing powder it is different. One may 
use cornmeal and corn flour half and 
half with wheat and have splendid 
muffins, batter cakes, corn bread and 
baking powder bread. You must keep 
this distinction clearly in mind if you 
wish to have good results, otherwise 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

39 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

you will waste your material. WITH 
YEAST YOU MUST USE MORE 
WHEAT FLOUR THAN WITH 
BAKING POWDER. 



Substitute Recipe 

You can take your regular recipe 
for making bread and use from one- 
quarter to one-third corn flour in 
place of wheat flour and make a per- 
fectly delicious white bread, or you 
can substitute one-third barley, rice, 
oat or potato flour and have a good, 
light bread. For instance, with the 
bread mixer, taking in proportion of 
one quart liquid to three quarts of 
sifted flour, you can use one quart 
of corn flour and two quarts of the 
wheat flour. You can also use one 
quart corn flour, one quart barley 
flour and one quart wheat flour. This, 
however, will not make quite as light 
a loaf as the corn flour and wheat 
flour bread. In making muffins and 
batter cakes, a splendid combination 
is one-half corn flour, one-fourth bar- 
ley flour and one-fourth wheat flour. 
Buckwheat cakes — two-thirds buck- 
wheat and one-third wheat flour, or 
one-third buckwheat, one-third corn 
flour and one-third wheat flour. In 
using cornmeal, one may use half (V2) 
and half (1/2) of the cornmeal and 
wheat flour, either for muffins or 
batter cakes. Corn flour is the finest 
substitute that we have in place of 
wheat flour. It is more nourishing 
than cornstarch, and for that reason 
cornstarch should not be used in its 
place in bread. It is easier to mix 
than cornmeal. It can be used in 
yeast bread, in baking powder 
bread, in cakes, pies and puddings, 
in soups and gravies. The splendid 
part is that it can be mixed half and 
half for pies, cakes, puddings, soups 
and gravies. Mixed one-quarter and 
one-third for breads, it is always 
ready to use. Every time you use a

bit of flour you save from one-quarter 
to one-half of your wheat flour. You 
do not need to change your recipes 
for corn flour in using it in these pro- 
portions. 

By using soft corn breads you need 
no wheat flour at all. Spoon corn 
bread is an example. 

Foundation Bread Recipe 

One quart of liquid to three quarts 
of sifted flour is the general rule. This 
is the same whether you use milk, 
milk and water or just water for the 
liquid. The liquid should be put in 
first, the seasonings added and then 
the flour. If you use milk it should 
be scalded first and cooled before 
using. All flour is to be sifted and 
measured after sifting. 

The following recipe will make four 
loaves of bread if a bread mixer is 
used. Crumble a cake of compressed 
yeast and put in a quart measure to- 
gether with one tablespoon sugar, 
one tablespoon salt, two tablespoons 
butterine or lard. Add enough 
milk or milk and water to fill the 
measure and turn into bread mixer. 
Add three quarts of flour. Turn the 
crank of the mixer for 10 or 15 min- 
utes. Cover and set in a warm place 
to rise. It should double. Then run 
a knife around the edge of the dough 
to free it from the pail. Turn the 
crank until the dough forms a ball 
around the kneading rod, lift out 
dough and rod together, push off 
dough onto your molding board, cut 
in four pieces and put in pans to rise. 
Bake in a fairly hot oven. 

In the above recipe one may use 
one quart corn flour, one quart rye 
or graham flour, one quart wheat 
flour. 

If oatmeal, cornmeal or potatoes 
are used as a substitute, then it is 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /l/u;a3's Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /l/u;aj's Reliable 

43 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

better to use the old-fashioned way 
of kneading with the hand, unless you 
are an experienced bread-maker. 
Cornmeal should be cooked, well 
beaten and cooled before the dis- 
solved yeast is added. Weigh the 
cornmeal and flour and use one-half 
the liquid in which to cook the corn- 
meal. An unexperienced cook should 
not try cornmeal as a substitute in 
making yeast bread. 

Another way in which every one 
can help save the wheat is to eat at 
least one slice of bread less each day 
and replace that slice by eating more 
of the foods that are rich in carbohy- 
drates. If you usually eat two slices 
of bread at dinner, take a second help- 
ing of potatoes and gravy instead of 
the other slice of bread. If you eat 
less bread and more milk gravies, to- 
gether with such things as rice, hom- 
iny or potato croquettes, you will get 
all the food values that you would 
have in your slice of bread and you 
will have saved the wheat. 

Barley Bread 

4 cups whole wheat flour. 

2 cups barley meal. 

1 cup water. 

1 cup milk. 

2 tablespoons molasses. 
1 teaspoon salt. 

y^ yeast cake. 

Boil milk and water and cool; add

little cold water ; stir in flour and bar- 
ley meal which have been sifted to- 
gether. Knead to a soft dough, add- 
ing more flour, if necessary. Cover 
and let rise until the mixture is double 
its bulk. Knead a second time, form 
into loaves, place in well greased pans 
and let rise a second time until dough 
has very nearly doubled its bulk. Bake 
in a hot oven from one-half to one 
hour, depending upon size of loaves.

2 tablespoons vegetable fat. 
% cup of milk. 

Mix the dry ingredients, sift and 
work in the fat little by little. Then 
add the liquid gradually so that it will 
make a dough that can be rolled out 
easily. Roll on a floured board, 1/2 
inch in thickness. Cut with biscuit 
cutter and bake in a hot oven 15 to 20 
minutes. To save time these biscuits 
may be pinched off like rolls and baked 
just like regular biscuits, but a little 
more liquid may be added so that the 
dough can be dropped from a pan into 
a baking tin. This saves the work of 
getting out the rolling pin and bread 
board, washing them and putting 
them away.

SOUPS AND SAUCES 

When once the habit of making a 
white sauce has been formed, a great 
step forward has been taken in utihz- 
ing left-overs, as well as extending 
foods to make them go further, a point 
that will be appreciated by the prac- 
tical housewife who knows what it 
means to have an unexpected guest 
when there is just enough food to go 
around for the family. By means of 
white sauce one may either add to the 
meat dish of the meal, increase the 
amount of the vegetable or add a new 
course, such as soup, for instance, be- 
cause white sauce is really the founda- 
tion of our cream soups. Another 
point that is important to remember 
in making cream soups and white 
sauce is that the sauce also increases 
the nourishment in the meal because 
of the milk, flour and butter that are 
needed to make them. This is forgot- 
ten too often. Milk, flour and butter 
really make a well-balanced food, al- 
though milk contains all the elements 
necessary for grown people. 

The point to remember in making 
white sauce is that blending of the fat 
and flour must be well done before the 
liquid is added, and then the liquid 
must be added slowly to prevent 
lumps. One may blend the flour and 
fat and beat in the milk and heat the 
white sauce with little fear of lumps 
or curdling. 

Foundation Recipes

(With Vegetables or Pulp Soup) 
Thin white sauce, 1 quart liquid, 4 
tablespoons flour, 4 tablespoons but- 
ter or fat, V/2 teaspoons salt, few 
grains pepper.

liquid, 8 tablespoons flour, 6 to 8 
tablespoons butterine, 2 teaspoons 
salt, few grains pepper. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— /l/ioa>'s Reliable

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Thin Soup — 1 quart liquid, 2 table- 
spoons flour, 2 tablespoons butterine, 
V2 to % cup of pulp, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
few grains pepper. 

Thick Soup — 1 quart liquid, 3 table- 
spoons flour, 3 tablespoons butterine, 
1/2 to 1 cup of pulp, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
few grains of pepper. 

In making the white sauce, milk 
should be heated, the flour for thick- 
ening mixed with a quarter of a cup 
of cold milk, beaten quickly with an 
egg beater, and then added to the 
scalded milk. After ten minutes' cook- 
ing it is ready to be poured into jars. 
This will keep two or three days and 
may be used as needed. 

Clear Soups 

It is not difficult to make other 
soups besides milk and cream soups 
provided one will give the matter of 
bones, trimmings and coarse vegeta- 
bles some attention. When buying 
meat insist upon having all bones and 
trimmings sent home. Cut off all par- 
ticles of fat so that these may be fried 
out for drippings, and then cook bones 
and trimmings in a soup kettle (a 
granite or porcelain lined stew pan 
will do for a small family). Add to 
this kettle the outside leaves of cab- 
bage, cauliflower, or lettuce, or any 
small pieces of onions, carrots, or tur- 
nips that may be at hand; Cook slow- 
ly and strain. Let the stock cool and 
remove any fat that may cake on top. 
The stock will form the base for many 
kinds of soup. For a consomme a little 
meat should be cooked in the stock 
and then removed to be used later. To 
clear the stock for consomme, add all 
the seasonings first and then clear 
with eggshells or part of the white of 
an egg. Consomme is good for an ap- 
petizer in cold weather, but as some- 
one has said, "is only the ghost of 
some good food," so do not depend on 
it for nourishment.

Be sure to remove all fat from soup 
stock. For this purpose it is best to 
cook it the day before it is to 
be used. With this stock as a base 
the housewife may have any number 
of soups, Julienne soup by adding car- 
rots, turnips and string beans, cut in 
long, thin slices. Egg soup by stirring 
a well-beaten egg into the hot stock, 
cheese soup by adding grated cheese 
and a dash of nutmeg, and so on. 

Cabbage and Potato Soup 

y^i pint boiled cabbage, finely minced. 

3 medium-sized potatoes. 

11/^ level tablespoons butter, drip- 
pings or other fat. 

1 teaspoon salt. 

i/i, teaspoon pepper. 

11/2 pints milk, whole or skim, or milk 
and water, boiling hot. 

Peel the potatoes, cover with boil- 
ing water and cook until tender, usu- 
ally 30 minutes; pour off the water 
and mash until fine and light. Add 
the cabbage, butter or other fat, and 
seasoning, then slowly add the hot 
milk or milk and water, and boil up 
well. If a thinner soup is required 
the amount of milk or milk and water 
can be increased. If liked, an onion 
cut up fine and cooked in a little water 
may be added or grated cheese may 
be served with it. Kale, turnips or 
a mixture of vegetables can be sub- 
stituted for the cabbage, if desired, 
and this is a good way to use up left- 
over vegetables. 

Corn Chowder 

One cup of corn, 1 quart milk, 1 
medium onion grated, 4 tablespoons 
butterine, 3 tablespoons flour, 1 tea- 
spoon salt, cayenne pepper, celery salt 
or bit of celery leaf, 1 egg slightly 
beaten. 

Canned or cooked corn, preferably 
put through the food chopper, may be 
used, or corn may be grated from the 
cob.

chowder from fire, cool slightly, stir 
a little into the beaten egg and add 
this egg mixture to the hot chowder,

pepper, few gratings of nutmeg, few 
gratings lemon rind (if desired). Sim- 
mer oatmeal and boiling water to- 
gether until changed almost to a jelly 
and reduced to about three cups (one 
to two hours required). Strain 
through a fine sieve, stir in gradually 
the cold milk and heat slowly with the 
onion, salt, pepper and butterine. Add 
a suspicion of nutmeg and grated 
lemon rind, and extra salt if required. 
This rule makes six generous portions.

spoon chopped parsley, IV2 table- 
spoons salt, bit of bay leaf, pepper. 
Peel potatoes, cut them in small 
pieces and cook till very soft in 
a small quantity of boiling salted 
water. Drain and mash; use one cup 
of the potato water for the soup. Scald 
milk with onion and the bay leaf ; re- . 
move these seasonings and add the hot 
mashed potato and the potato water. 
Bind with butterine and flour and sea- 
son. Strain if necessary, and sprinkle 
in the chopped parsley just before 
serving.

HINTS ABOUT 
COOKING FISH 

Clean fish thoroughly and see that 
it is fresh. If frozen fish is used, cook 
as soon as thawed out. To boil fish, 
add one-half teaspoon salt, one table- 
spoon vinegar to each quart of water. 
The salt gives the flavor, the vinegar 
keeps the flesh of the fish firm and 
white. Have the water warm, but not 
boihng. If you have no fish basket, 
put cheesecloth or an old linen napkin 
m the kettle, and place fish on this, 
so that you can remove it without 
having it break to pieces. 

Baked fish may be either stuffed 
with a filling made as for poultry or 
the fish may be split down the back. 
A tin fish sheet is an excellent thing 
for baking fish. If this is not at hand, 
one may place strips of clean cotton 
cloth under the fish, in order to re- 
move it easily after it is baked. 

In frying fish the pieces should be 
wiped dry, seasoned, dipped in egg 
and cracker crumbs and fried a light 
brown. In sauteing fish the pieces may 
be rolled in flour or cornmeal, and 
fried in drippings until a light brown 
on each side. 

Small fish should be rolled in flour 
— some prefer cornmeal — and then 
fried a crisp brown, using plenty of 
fat. Smelts are attractive made into 
rings before being fried by fastening 
the head and tails together with 
wooden toothpicks. These may be re- 
moved after the smelts are fried and 
on the platter. 

Fish needs so much fat in frying 
that it is a good plan to have a pail 
or jar labeled "fish fat," and pour the 
fat back into this receptacle each time 
after frying the fish. 

It is hard to get fish odor out of 
pans or kettles in which they have 
been cooking — a good pinch of baking 
soda and boiling hot water help much 
in getting rid of this.

OYSTERS 

The food value of the oyster rests 
not only in its nutritive qualities, but 
also in the ease with w^hich it is di- 
gested; for this reason oysters are a 
valuable food for invalids and for 
others whose digestive powers are 
weak. Although the gi'eater part of 
the oyster is water, it contains pro- 
tein, fat and carbohydrates in such 
proportions as to more nearly ap- 
proach milk than any other common 
food. When oysters are cooked in 
combination with milk or eggs, as so 
often is done, the nutritive value is 
greatly increased, as, for instance, in 
oyster stew or in fried oysters. 

Oysters should be as fresh as pos- 
sible, and to insure this see that you 
have a reliable dealer, who will not 
serve you with oysters that have been 
dead a long time, or that have been 
fattened. Oysters that have been 
"plumped," that is, fattened by being 
allowed to stand in fresh or brackish 
water (with a little cornmeal added 
in some cases to help the process) , are 
liable to become infected. According- 
ly the process is considered very dan- 
gerous. 

The digestibility of an oyster may 
be impaired in the cooking. Too long 
cooking toughens it and renders it un- 
fit for the sick or delicate, and also* 
destroys the fine flavor. Fortunately, 
it is such a simple thing to cook an 
oyster properly that an amateur can 
readily learn to do it. 

The point to remember is to let the 
oyster cook just long enough to permit 
it to swell and to cause the edges to 
begin to curl. Then take up and serve 
immediately. In making oyster stew 
have everything ready to serve; the 
milk hot and seasoned and the serving 
dishes ready. Then put in the oysters, 
standing right over them until they 
plump and curl; take up quickly.

Creamed oysters should be treated 
the same way. Have the white sauce 
hot and the toast ready ; then drop in 
the oysters. It only takes three or 
four minutes to cook the oysters un- 
less a large quantity has been added 
at one time. It will take a little 
longer to heat up the mixture in that 
case. 

Scalloped oysters should be cooked 
just long enough to allow them to 
plump out and to brown the crumbs. 
It toughens them to cook them 
longer. 

Pan roast oysters are easily pre- 
pared. Run the oysters through the 
fingers to see that no particles of 
shell are sticking to them. Put a bit 
of butter or vegetable fat in the fry- 
ing-pan; add the oysters and stir 
gently until the edges begin to turn ; 
season with salt and pepper and serve 
on rounds of toast with a few sprigs 
of watercress and a slice of lemon. 
An eighth of a lemon is sufficient for 
each serving.

MEATS 

The common methods of cooking 
meats are by roasting, boiUng, broil- 
ing and braising. To get the best re- 
sults in any one of these forms one 
must know something about the effect 
of temperature upon meat. 

Heat sears the surface of the meat 
and keeps the inner juices from run- 
ning out. For that reason in roasting 
meat have the oven very hot when 
the meat is put in and then as soon 
as it begins to brown reduce the heat. 
This will give a crisp brown outside 
and red through. The average time 
for a five-pound roast rare is sixty- 
five minutes, well done, eighty min- 
utes. Add five or six minutes more 
for each additional pound. 

In boiling meat for soup put on to 
cook in cold water so that the juices 
may be extracted. For boiled meats 
or fowls, plunge into boiling water 
in order to coagulate juices in outer 
surface and preserve inner juices. 
This rule is used where flavor and 
nutriment is desired in meat. 

By putting the meat in warm but 
not boiling water and bringing to the 
boiling point quickly, part of the nu- 
triment and flavor will be in the broth 
and part in the meat. This is fine for 
stews and Scotch broth. 

Casserole Cookery 

Women in foreign countries have 
known the value of the casserole for 
many years. In America it has been 
difficult to get the average housewife 
to understand its full value. In the 
first place, the casserole means, as a 
usual thing, long and slow cooking; a 
thing which the American women 
have been trying to get away from; 
but it also means better food for the 
family, because many foods are im- 
proved and made more palatable and 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

74 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



For Clippings 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

75 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

more digestible by long cooking. It 
also aids in economy. By the use of 
the casserole many left-overs may be 
combined and made into palatable 
and nourishing dishes, which are 
more easily digested than the fried 
and more elaborate dishes, such as 
croquettes and cutlets. The casserole 
is an especially valuable thing to use 
for cooking food in cold weather, as it 
keeps the food piping hot longer than 
any other preparation and serving. 
The casserole and fireless cooker 
should be part of the equipment in 
every kitchen. They serve somewhat 
the same end. 

Italian Hash 

3 cups cold cooked meat cut in 

small slices. 
3 small onions. 
11/2 peppers. 

1 cup of white sauce or gravy. 
3 cups of cold cooked rice. 

The pepper and onions should be 
sliced thin and parboiled before add- 
ing to the meat. Grease the casserole 
and line with border of rice, mixing 
the meat, vegetables and juice to- 
gether and place in the middle of 
casserole. Bake in a moderate oven 
20 to 25 minutes. This may be brown- 
ed in the broiler just before serving. 
Serve in casserole. Uncooked meat 
may be used. Use one pound of lamb 
to three cups rice or mashed potatoes. 

Braised Beef 

Select a piece of beef weighing 
three or four pounds, cut off of the 
shoulder or under part of the round, 
and if possible have it at least three 
inches thick. This last is important, 
for if the piece of beef is too thin it 
will fall to pieces in the cooking. 

Wash the beef, trim off rough 
edges; rub lightly with flour and 
brown on both sides in a frying-pan. 
Cut one-half pound salt pork into 
dice. If you have no way of weighing 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— >l/u;a3's Reliable

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

the pork, cut enough for a half 
cup. Then cut into dice or small 
pieces one large potato, carrot, onion, 
turnip, a head of celery and one- 
fourth of a small head of cabbage. 
If all of these vegetables are not 
at hand, three or four will do. 
Divide the cut-up vegetables and salt 
pork into two equal parts. Place one 
part into the cooking kettle, then lay 
the beef on these. Add six whole 
black peppers, four bay leaves, some 
parsley, sage, thyme or savory; in 
fact, I usually put in a little of every 
kind of dried herbs that I have on 
hand. Then place the remaining por- 
tion of vegetables over the meat. 
Pour over this two cups of boiling 
water, salt to taste, cover closely and 
put on the stove over a fire that will 
just keep it simmering gently for 
from four to six hours. Then lift the 
meat carefully on to a platter, pour 
the vegetables around it and serve. 
Be careful not to let the fire get hot 
enough to make the contents of the 
kettle boil briskly or the beef will fall 
to pieces, and there will be beef stew 
instead of braised beef. This dish is 
nice to cook in a fireless cooker or it 
is equally good in a casserole. Also it 
is good to have when the housewife 
wants to go to church Sunday morn- 
ing, preparing it Saturday night. 

Braised Chicken or 
Guinea Fowl 

Braising offers a good way to cook 
old chickens or fowls. Prepare as for 
roasting. Then follow directions for 
braised beef, except the cabbage is 
omitted. Cover the kettle closely and 
set where the contents will simmer 
- for three or four hours. This last 
is most important, for brisk boiling 
spoils both the appearance and the 
flavor. Guinea fowls or chickens 
treated in this way with very slow 
boiling will please a particular palate.

Braised Breast of Mutton 

One breast mutton, few slices ba- 
con,, one-half pint stock, one lemon, 
one onion, salt. 

Line the bottom of a casserole or 
other earthenware baking dish with 
a few thin slices of bacon, lay the 
mutton on these and put over it the 
lemon, which has been peeled and cut 
into slices. Cover with one or two 
more slices of bacon and add the stock 
and onion. Cover the dish. Cook 
slowly on the top of the stove or in 
the oven until the meat is tender. 



Broiled Steak 

Wipe the steak with a clean cloth 
which has been wrung out of cold 
water. Cut off the superfluous fat. 
Grease a wire broiler with the fat 
that has been cut off; place the steak 
on the broiler and put over a clear 
fire. Turn broiler every 10 seconds 
until both sides of the steak have 
been seared, then turn less often. 
Rare steak will take five minutes ; 
well done steak six or seven. One 
may really broil steak in a frying- 
pan, provided it is done properly. 
Have the iron frying-pan very hot so 
that it smokes freely when greased 
with the fat of the steak. Grease 
thoroughly and place the steak in the 
frying-pan, turn constantly until both 
sides are browned. A rare steak one- 
inch thick may be done in three min- 
utes and well done in five to six min- 
utes. Remove from frying-pan, place 
on platter and season with salt, pep- 
per and a little butterine.

is only a scant allowance of meat, it 
may be made to go farther as fol- 
lows: Make a stuffing as for chicken 
seasoning with a little chopped celery 
and onion. If these are not at hand 
use celery salt and onion, or onion 
salt. Make thin cakes of the ham- 
burg, which has been seasoned to 
taste with salt and pepper. Place a 
layer of the stuffing on one cake and 
cover with the other. Set the stuffed 
cakes in a shallow baking pan and 
bake in a moderate oven for 20 min- 
utes. Or a good-sized earthen dish 
may be lined with half of the sea- 
soned chopped steak, a layer of stuf- 
fing placed on this and covered with 
the rest of the meat. Pour three 
tablespoonfuls of hot water over the 
dish and bake for 20 minutes. Serve 
in the dish in which it is baked. Cold 
meat of any kind may be run through 
the food chopper or cut in fine pieces 
and treated in the second way with 
good results. 

Stuffed Flaniz or Skirt Steak 

Stuffed flank or skirt steak is an- 
other excellent way to make the 
amount of meat seem much larger. 
The butcher should make a pocket in 
the steak. Fill this with any kind of 
force meat that you may be able to 
make. If there is a bit of salmon or 
sausage, or a couple of fried oysters, 
add these to your regular stuffing 
made of corn bread when that is at 
hand, and fill the pocket in the steak 
with this. Sew up the pocket and 
place steak in a dripping pan and bake 
three-fourths of an hour. 

C flic ken a la King 

Melt a tablespoon of butter in a 
pan, add a pepper chopped in squares 
and one or more of mushrooms. Stir 
and cook four minutes, add two level 
tablespoons of flour and one-half 
teaspoon of salt. Cook until frothy,

then add one pint of cream and stir 
until it thickens. Set over hot water. 
Add three cups of cooked chicken 
and let stand to be very hot. In the 
meantime cream the fifth of a cup 
of butter, beat into it the yolks of 
three eggs, a tablespoon of lemon 
juice and a teaspoon of paprika. 
Stir this mixture into the hot chicken 
until the egg thickens. This will 
serve six people liberally. 

Mock Duck 

Mock duck is made by placing on a 
round steak a stuffing of bread 
crumbs well seasoned with chopped 
onions, butterine, chopped suet or 
drippings, salt, pepper and a little 
sage, if the flavor is relished. The 
steak is then rolled around the stuf- 
fing and tied with a string in several 
places. If the steak seems tough, 
the roll is steamed or stewed until 
tender before roasting in the oven 
until brown. Or it may be cooked in 
a casserole or other covered dish, in 
which case a cupful or more of water 
or soup-stock should be poured 
around the meat. 

Stuffed Heart 

Wash the heart thoroughly, but do 
not let it stand in water. A medium- 
sized beef heart is best. Stuff with 
filling seasoned as you like for poul- 
try. Sew or skewer together and 
bake in a moderate oven for one and 
one-half hours or until tender. Keep 
a little water in the baking-pan all 
the time and turn the heart occasion- 
ally, which will allow it to cook tender 
without getting too dry. Calves' 
hearts may be stuffed and browned 
in a pan with some carrots and tur- 
nips cut in heart shapes and then 
turned into a casserole and cooked for 
an hour. A gravy may be made and 
turned over the hearts and vegetables 
before serving. Hearts should be 
served piping hot.

Mutton With Fruits 

In the Orient it is a common cus- 
tom to cook mutton with various 
fruits. Quinces, pears, apricots and 
prunes, either fresh or dried, are used 
for this purpose. The fruit and meat 
should be cooked separately and re- 
heated in combination. Some recipes 
direct that the meat be browned be- 
fore cooking in water, others that it 
simply be stewed in water. Of the 
many recipes that might be given, the 
following, based on Oriental recipes, 
is selected: 

Mutton With Rice Rolls 

A characteristic Turkish dish is 
"sarma," or rolls made of meat and 
broken rice wrapped in grape leaves 
and then boiled. An acceptable sub- 
stitute for this dish, and one more in 
accord with common methods, m.ay 
be made by cooking chopped mutton 
and rice in a baking dish lined Vvith 
slices of tart apples, which gives an 
even more pronounced tart flavor than 
the grape leaves.

twenty-five minutes, or until tender, 
using just enough water to cover. 
Drain and serve with soft butter or 
butterine, using two tablespoons to 
each bunch of asparagus. Save the 
water in which the asparagus has 
been cooked. Add the tough ends and 
cook again. Strain and thicken with 
thick white sauce for cream of aspara- 
gus soup. 

Asparagus may be cooked until ten- 
der, cut in small pieces and served 
with a white sauce. 

It is good to use for salads either 
alone or combined with string beans 
or tomatoes. 

Beets 

In buying new beets utilize every- 
thing. Cut off the leaves, cook and 
serve like spinach, cut the stems in 
one-inch pieces, boil until tender in 
salted water and serve with drawn 
butter like asparagus, or with a sour 
sauce made as follows : One table- 
spoon of cornstarch, one cup of water 
or milk, one tablespoon of lemon 
juice, one-eighth teaspoon of salt. 
Cook until blended and pour over the 
beet stems. This sauce also may be 
used for the beets themselves. 

Wash the beets, but do not break 
the skin, boil or bake until tender, 
cut in slices and serve with sauce or 
melted butter.

Baked beets, parsnips and carrots 
are sweeter than when boiled. They 
require a little more time to bake 
than potatoes. 

Beans 

Beans, both green and dried, are so 
valuable that one should make the 
most of them in war time. Almost 
any war garden can raise beans. The 
green beans offer variety and "rough- 
age." The dried beans are valuable 
as a substitute for meat. Soy beans 
and cow peas were originally raised 
for feeding stock. For that reason 
many persons do not know that they 
are good to eat, easy to cook and a 
more valuable substitute for meat than 
the plain ones that we know so well. 

String beans: Wash, remove 
strings, cut in pieces and cook until 
tender in boiling water. Add salt a 
few minutes before seasoning. Season 
with butter or ham drippings. 

Dried beans, lima or marrow fat: 
Cook slowly until- tender, salt, then 
serve with butterine, or tomato sauce, 
or put in a baking dish, add a little 
molasses, a bacon rind or tiny piece of 
salt pork, add enough liquid to cover 
the beans, bake one hour. 

Soy beans and cow peas may be 
used green or dried just like navy 
beans. A little mustard added just 
before baking improves them. 

Country Cabbage 

Country cabbage must be carefully 
watched while cooking. The neces- 
sary ingredients are : 

1 small head of cabbage. 
1 egg. 

1 teaspoon of salt. 
1 cup of cream. 
1 tablespoon of butterine. 
1/4 cup of vinegar. 
Paprika.

Cut the cabbage fine on a cutter (or 
chop reasonably fine) and put in a 
granite frying pan with the butterine 
and salt. If you use a gas range put 
an asbestos mat over the flame and 
set the pan on that. Then toss lightly 
with a fork until the salt begins to 
draw the water out of the cabbage, 
cover and stir occasionally to keep 
from sticking to the pan. Cook until 
the cabbage is tender, which will take 
about 20 minutes. Be careful not to 
let the cabbage bi'own. The secret of 
success with this dish is to steam the 
cabbage until it is tender, but keeping 
it white. Beat the egg, add the cream 
and then the vinegar, stir lightly and 
pour over the cabbage, let come to the 
boiling point and serve at once with 
paprika sprinkled lightly over the top. 

Creamed Cabbage 

Remove outside leaves from head 
of cabbage and use for soup stock. 
Cut up the cabbage into pieces about 
one-half-inch thick and two inches 
long. Cook 15 minutes in salted 
water; strain and add hot white 
sauce. Place the cabbage in a serv- 
ing dish and pour a proportion of one 
cup of white sauce to one* quart of 
cabbage. Sprinkle paprika over top 
before serving. 

Swedish Cabbage 

Prepare cabbage as in recipe given 
above; then add one small piece of 
mace and two cloves. When tender, 
strain and add one-half cup of milk 
to one pint of cabbage. Serve hot. 

Carrots 

Carrots are valuable for their en- 
ergy-giving quality, fibre and mineral 
substance. They also furnish attract- 
ive garnishes for other foods. They 
may be used as a vegetable alone or 
combined with starchy foods such as

rice, macaroni and potatoes. They can 
also be utilized in making jams, can- 
dies, cakes and patties. 

Carrots, French Style 

Scrape, cut in dice and cook in salt- 
ed water, to which one-eighth tea- 
spoon of grated nutmeg and one 
teaspoon of sugar have been added, 
until tender, which will take from 
15 to 20 minutes (25 minutes if the 
carrots are old). When tender, drain 
in colander; put two tablespoonfuls 
butterine or other fat in a frying-pan, 
add carrots and toss about until light 
brown. Serve hot. 

Creamed Carrots 

Prepare as above ; cook until tender 
in salted water. Serve with thin, 
white sauce. 

Dandelion 

Prepare, cook and serve like 
spinach. Your dandelion may be cut 
in pieces and used uncooked in salads. 
Cooked as greens, dandelions are im- 
proved by the addition of a bit of salt 
pork or a piece of bacon rind. 

Fried Eggplant 

Cut the eggplant in slices about 
half an inch thick and pare. Sprinkle 
the slices with salt and pile them upon 
one another, put a plate with a weight 
on top of the slices. Let them rest for 
an hour, then remove weight and 
plate. Add one tablespoon water, 
half a teaspoon of salt and half a 
teaspoon of pepper to an egg. Beat 
well. Dip the slices of the eggplant in 
the egg, then in dried bread crumbs. 
Fry till brown (in deep fat). 

Stewed Mushrooms 

One-half pound of mushrooms, re- 
move stems, scrape and cut in pieces. 
Peel the caps and break into pieces.

Melt two tablespoons of butter or 
butterine, toss the mushrooms about 
for two minutes, dredge with flour. 
Add one-half cup of hot water or 
soup stock, cover and cook slowly for 
five minutes. 

Sauted Mushrooms 

Wash the mushrooms, remove 
stems, pesl the caps, break in pieces, 
dredge with flour and toss in a hot 
frying pan with two tablespoons of 
fat to each cup of mushrooms. 
Saute five minutes, then add one- 
quarter teaspoon salt to each cup 
of mushrooms, four or five drops 
of onion juice, one-quarter cup of 
boiling water; cook two or three min- 
utes longer. A tablespoonful of 
grated cheese may be added before 
serving on hot toast or on toasted 
cornmeal muflins split in half. 

Onions 

Glaced Onions — Small white onions 
are best for this purpose. Remove 
skins. Cook until tender in salted 
water, which will take from 15 to 20 
minutes, using only enough water to 
keep from scorching. Place onions in 
a glazed or granite dish and add two 
tablespoons butter or butterine to 
one quart of onions. Sprinkle lightly 
with sugar; add one-half cup of milk 
or stock. Brown in the oven. 

Parsnips 

Boil parsnips one hour until ten- 
der; throw into cold water and re- 
move skins. Then cut in slices length- 
wise not thicker than one-fourth inch. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
brovni on both sides in bacon or meat 
drippings. Or dip in melted butter, 
roll in flour and brown on both sides. 

A second method is to mash the 
boiled parsnips after the skins have 
been removed; season and stir into

them one tablespoon of flour and one 
egg. Form into small cakes and fry 
brown in drippings. 

Peas 

Peas, both fresh and dried, form a 
valuable food for the family. Fresh 
green peas do not furnish the protein 
and energy that the dried peas do, but 
they are valuable nevertheless. 

Dried Pea Soup: This is a splendid 
food for children. 

11/2 cups dried peas, or 1 cup split 

peas 
2 quarts water 
1 small onion 
1 tablespoon drippings 

Pick over peas, soak several hours. 
Drain and ada 2 quarts of cold water. 
Simmer until tender; rub through 
sieve and boil. 

Peppers 

Stuffed Peppers — Select uniform 
peppers; remove core and seeds and 
par-boil. Make filling of any cold 
cooked meat at hand and use one-half 
meat to one-half breadcrumbs ; sea- 
son with onion salt and celery salt, 
or add one-half onion sliced very thin 
and two stalks of celery to three cups 
of filling. Bind together with a 
couple of tablespoons of milk or an 
egg; season with salt and pepper to 
taste. Fill the peppers, using one- 
half cup of filling to each pepper 
and place in a shallow baking dish. 
Add one cup of water or stock to 
the dish and bake 15 to 20 minutes. 

Pepper Garnish 

Peppers may be used raw or cooked 
as a garnish for salads, both meat 
and vegetable and also used with 
rice and meat cakes. When used as 
a garnish for meat and rice, the pep- 
per should be uncooked and cut in 
very thin slices.

Potatoes 

The potato is a good energy-fur- 
nishing food. It is full of starch which 
is converted into fuel in the body and 
helps you to work just as coal burns 
to keep up steam in an engine, or gaso- 
line burns in an engine to keep ma- 
chinery going or to furnish electric- 
ity. With potatoes you need less 
bread. Eat an extra potato in place 
of bread. You can take a baked pota- 
to, break it in pieces and eat it with 
butter just as you do a piece of bread. 

Potatoes give mineral salts which 
you need to keep your body in order. 
To get the most of the mineral salts 
the potatoes should be baked or boiled 
with the skins on as the mineral salts 
lie near the surface. Moreover it is 
a waste of time and potato to pare 
and then cook the potatoes. Boiled in 
their "jackets," small potatoes may 
be peeled easily and then browned 
whole in a frying pan or with meat 
in the oven. They may be riced and 
seasoned, making the best kind of 
mashed potatoes. They may be 
creamed, mashed or browned or 
served in any fashion. English food 
bulletins brand as a traitor the wom- 
an who pares her potatoes before 
cooking them. 

Potatoes belong to the small number 
of foods that require quick cooking. 
They should be put on to cook in boil- 
ing salted water and kept boiling rap- 
idly for 20 or 30 minutes, according 
to the size of the potatoes. The water 
should be drained off immediately and 
thoroughly and the kettle placed on 
the back of the stove or over a hot 
(but not lighted) gas burner to fin- 
ish frying off the potatoes. If pota- 
toes are cooked too long or not thor- 
oughly dried they get soggy. Baked 
potatoes must be taken from the oven 
as soon as they are done or they will 
get soggy also or dry up. If the meal

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

hour is not fixed immovably it is bet- 
ter not to have potatoes baked in their 
skins but boiled first, then peeled and 
browned in the oven. 

In mashing potatoes the potatoes 
should be thoroughly cooked and 
mashed or riced until free from lumps. 
Beat in the butter, add the hot milk. 
Be sure to have it hot. About one- 
half cup milk to six medium-sized po- 
tatoes, and beat light like cake. Set 
kettle in a pan of hot water if pota- 
toes cannot be served at once. 

Potatoes are good to use in cake or 
bread. In cake substitute mashed po- 
tatoes beat light as above in the pro- 
portion one cup of mashed potatoes 
for one-half cup of milii; and one-half 
cup of flour in your regular cake re- 
cipe. 

Potatoes are a splendid foundation 
for meat substitution dishes. They 
may be combined with cheese, nuts or 
cooked dried beans. 

Left-over potatoes will extend meat 
dishes, too. 

Potato Rolls With Meat 

Fill a baking dish half full of 
chopped cold meat, seasoned well and 
moistened with gravy (or milk, then 
dredged with flour). Shape rolls of 
mashed potatoes about the size of 
an ordinary croquette. Arrange these 
as a cover over the meat and bake un- 
til rolls are lightly brown. Vegetables 
may be used to help out meat and an 
egg may be beaten into the potatoes 
for a change. 

Salsify 

Salsify is a vegetable which should 
be used more generally than it is. It 
is good boiled or in fritters. The salsi- 
fy should be scraped, cut in pieces and 
dropped in water to which has been 
added one teaspoon of vinegar to a 
quart of water, or a few drops of 
lemon juice may be added to the

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

water. This acid is necessary to keep 
the salsify from turning dark. When 
the salsify has been boiled until ten- 
der in salted water, it may be served 
with white sauce. 

Squash 

The various varieties of the sum- 
mer squash are generally cooked when 
so small and tender that the thumb 
nail can pierce the rind easily. 

To prepare for the table wash the 
squash, cut into small pieces, and 
either cook in boiling water or steam 
it. It will cook in boiling water in 
half an hour. It takes about an hour 
to cook it in the steamer. The cooked 
squash is mashed fine and seasoned 
with salt, pepper and butter. This 
method gives a delicate flavored but 
rather watery dish. 

Summer squash is very palatable 
cut in slices and fried like eggplant. 

Baked Squash 

For baking, the Hubbard squash is 
the best. This should be cut into two- 
inch squares and placed in a baking 
pan. To each square a dot of 
butterine and one-quarter teaspoon 
sugar should be added. The pan 
should be covered and squash baked 
for 20 minutes, then the cover should 
be removed and the squash baked un- 
til tender and slightly brown. It 
should be served in garnish. The 
sugar gives a sweet taste and where 
this is not desired the fat should be 
sufficient and the sugar can be 
omitted. 

Spinach 

Spinach must be cleaned thorough- 
ly in order to get rid of any grit or 
sand that may cling to it. The spin- 
ach should be washed in several wa- 
ters and should be lifted from the wa- 
ter rather than be left in the vessel

and have the water poured off, be- 
cause the sand that comes with the 
spinach will drop to the bottom and 
if the water is poured off the sand is 
left in the kettle. 

Spinach should be cooked in as lit- 
tle water as possible in order to pre- 
serve all its juices. In fact, it is best 
cooked in a steamer. Cook 20 or 30 
minutes or until tender. Chop rather 
fine and to each quart of spinach add 
two tablespoons of melted butterine. 
Serve piping hot. 

Leftover spinach may bo utilized 
in several ways. First, spinach on 
toast. Make a sauce by blending two 
tablespoons of flour with one table- 
spoon butter and add one cup of meat 
stock or milk and a dash of nutmeg; 
add chopped spinach, heat thoroughly 
and pour over toast. 

A simple and palatable way to 
serve spinach is as follows: Chop 
four slices of bacon in small pieces 
(there should be about one-half cup), 
brown in a frying pan and add one 
cup of bread crumbs. Toss about 
until light brown and then add two 
cups of cooked spinach chopped, one 
tablespoon of onion juice, one table- 
spoon lemon juice or vinegar, salt 
and pepper to taste. Heat thor- 
oughly and heap in a mount on platter 
and garnish with slices of hard- 
boiled egg. Rice croquettes are good 
to serve with this dish. Potato balls 
also form a fine adjunct. Prepare the 
potato balls by cooking them in just 
enough salted water to cover them. 
When tender season with butter and 
arrange around the greens. Cheese 
may be grated over both rice and 
potatoes to give a more piquant flavor 
and add a bit more nourishment. 

Tomatoes 

To get the best results from toma- 
toes it must be remembered that the 
seasoning should be thoroughly cooked 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

114 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



For Clippings 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD-Always Reliable

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

into them. Southern cooks make it a 
point to set their tomatoes one-half 
day on the back of the range, where 
cooking will go on very slowly. The 
same results may be obtained by cook- 
ing tomatoes in a fireless cooker. To- 
matoes also require a great deal of 
salt, some more than others, so it is 
best to try the tomatoes to see if they 
have salt enough in them. In addi- 
tion to salt two tablespoons of but- 
terine, four cloves, one-quarter tea- 
spoon of celery salt and a dash of 
pepper. Cook on the back of the 
range for three or four hours. If the 
tomatoes are unusually acid, add one 
teaspoon of sugar. 

Another way of cooking tomatoes is 
to add the salt and fat as in the recipe 
above, two onions sliced thin, cook 
slowly two hours on back of stove; 
thicken with one teaspoon of corn- 
starch dissolved in a little water. 
Serve either plain or with toasted 
cornmeal muffins. 

Fried Tomatoes 

Fried tomatoes make an excellent 
dish to serve as a vegetable or to com- 
bine with eggs, rice or onions. Re- 
move the skin by running the back of 
a knife gently over the tomato, press- 
ing the skin firmly, and then take the 
point of the knife and remove the 
skin from top of tomato. This method 
is much better than scalding the to- 
mato in order to remove the skin. Cut 
into half-inch slices (some prefer one- 
inch slices), have the fat hot and fry 
quickly, turning to brown on both 
sides. Season with salt and celery 
salt. Serve hot. 

Fried Green Tomatoes 

Pare, cut into half-inch slices, sea- 
son with salt and pepper; dip in egg 
and roll in cracker crumbs or corn- 
meal, and fry like oysters. These 
resemble oysters in taste.

SALADS 

We have been too apt to consider 
salads as a mere accessory to the 
meal in this country. We ought on 
the other hand to make much more of 
salads as a real factor. We would do 
well in this regard to copy our foreign 
born population who use greens of all 
kinds, fruits and meat in salads as a 
part of their meal. In summer time 
a salad dish may well take the place 
of a hot roast or chop for dinner. In 
the winter time we can find no better 
main dish for lunch than a salad 
properly made. Of course, to keep all 
the food values properly balanced, one 
must not think of salad or cress with 
a French dressing on it as a high fuel 
giving dish; but lettuce, cress, en- 
dive, chicory " combined with fruits 
and vegetables, or vegetables and 
meats with a boiled salad dressing or 
a mayonnaise dressing will furnish all 
the fuel value that anyone needs at a 
meal. Salads, particularly fruit, veg- 
etable and nut salads, are valuable 
not only for their fuel value, but also 
for the amount of vitamines that they 
furnish the body. Vitamines are the 
growth promoting elements that we 
all need, but which very few, even 
scientists, understand. We do know, 
however, that they are furnished in 
uncooked vegetables and other raw 
foods, such as milk and fruit juice. 
' They are growth promoting for chil- 
dren and health preserving for grown 
people. 

Salad Dressing 

It used to be a great task to make 
mayonnaise salad dressing or even 
plain boiled and French salad 
dressing. Under the new method 
there is nothing difficult at all about 
it, and no one need have any diffi- 
culty if they follow these directions.

Put all the dry ingredients in the 
double-boiler, mix, add butter and 
milk and set over fire to heat. Beat 
the egg and stir into mixture and keep 
stirring until it begins to thicken. 
Then add vinegar. The secret of suc- 
cess is slow cooking. Too hot a flame 
will make it thicken quickly and then 
there is danger of lumps. A boiled 
dressing is particularly good for fruit 
salads and the lighter vegetables, let- 
tuce, cress, cucumbers and tomatoes. 
It may be enriched by beating in four 
or five tablespoonfuls of olive oil, or 
using whipped cream with it in equal 
parts. This last is particularly good 
with orange, grapefruit and cherry 
salad or pineapple and strawberry 
salad. 

French Salad Dressing 

1/2 teaspoon salt. 

6 tablespoons oil. 

14 teaspoon paprika. 

2 to 6 tablespoons vinegar. 

Mix salt, pepper and oil and beat in 
vinegar gradually. All meat used in 
salad should be "marinated ;" that is, 
should be covered with a dressing of 
this kind and allowed to stand an 
hour or two before using. This should 
be done even if mayonnaise dressing 
is to be used later. Such vegetables 
as potatoes, beets, beans, peas and 
carrots are much improved if treated 
the same way. Crisp vegetables, cress,

cucumbers, lettuce or tomatoes should 
not be allowed to stand after this 
dressing has been added. It should 
be put on just before serving the 
salad or the vegetables will wither. 
A rich-looking dressing is gained by 
adding more paprika. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

1/^ teaspoon salt. 

1/4 teaspoon paprika. 

1 Ggg (yolk of). 

% cup of olive oil. 

3 teaspoons lemon juice. 

3 teaspoons vinegar. 

1 teaspoon sugar. 

1/2 teaspoon mustard if desired. 

Put salt, paprika and yolk of the 
egg in a large jelly glass and beat 
well with a small Dover egg beater. 
Then add oil, one teaspoon at a time, 
beating well between until four tea- 
spoons have been added. Then the 
oil may be added, two tablespoons at 
a time until all is used. This will 
make a very thick emulsion. Thin 
with the lemon juice and vinegar, add- 
ing a teaspoon of each alternately and 
beating well between. This is a con- 
venient way to make a salad dressing, 
for if at any time you are interrupted 
while beating you can set the jelly 
glass, egg beater and all in the re- 
frigerator and keep it cool until you 
can finish making the dressing. 



Banana Salad 

Remove one section of skin from 
each of four bananas. Take out fruit, 
scrape and cut fruit from one banana 
into thin slices, fruit from other three 
bananas into half-inch cubes. Mari- 
nate cubes with French dressing. Re- 
fill skins and garnish each with slices 
of banana. Stack around a mould of 
lettuce leaves.

Brazilian Salad 

Remove skins and seeds from white 
grapes and cut in halves lengthwise. 
Add an equal quantity of shredded 
fresh pineapple, apples pared, cored 
and cut in small pieces ; then add one- 
quarter pound quantity of Brazilian 
nuts broken in pieces. Mix thorough- 
ly and season with lemon juice. Use 
mayonnaise dressing to which whip-. 
ped cream has been added. 

Cabbage and Beet Salad 

Chop the cabbage fine, season with 
onion and celery salt. Mix with a 
boiled salad dressing and arrange in 
a dish with a border of lettuce leaves. 
Garnish with tiny hearts cut from 
boiled beets. 

Jellied Cabbage Salad 

1 tablespoon gelatine. 
l^ cup cold water. 
11/2 cups boiling water. 
1/2 cup sugar. 

14 cup lemon juice. 

3 cups chopped cabbage. 

2 green peppers (chopped).

Soak the gelatine in the cold 
water and dissolve it in the boiling 
water. Add the other ingredients 
and turn into a quart brick mold or

half cupful of cold water. Fill a mold 
or a large bowl with this almost full. 
When it has hardened sufficiently, 
take out the centre and fill the cavity 
with celery cut fine, Enghsh walnuts 
in pieces of same size as the celery 
and apples cut into small pieces. Pour 
over them a dressing made by using 
three tablespoonfuls of the aspic jelly 
melted and mixed with two table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, salt and pepper 
to taste. Cover this with the rest of 
the hardened aspic jelly, and when 
cold turn into a flat dish, and garnish 
with lettuce, parsley or any green at 
hand. 

Grapefruit and Nut Salad 

Remove skin from grape fruit. 
With a sharp knife cut the skin of the 
section along the inner edge and re- 
move. Break the sections into small 
portions. Drain. Add about 1-3 cup- 
ful of broken nut meats, mix with 
French dressing. Serve on lettuce 
leaf. 

NOTE. — Apple, orange or celery 
cut in inch lengths or any combina- 
tion of these may be used in place of 
the grape fruit. 

Pear Salad 

Wipe, pare and cut pears in half 
lengthwise, then remove the seeds. 
Dip the halves in stiffly-whipped 
cream and roll in finely-chopped Eng- 
lish walnuts. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and serve with a little mayon- 
naise dressing at the side. Canned 
pears may be used. 

Strawberry Salad 

Select large, firm berries, chill and 
cut in halves. To one cup straw- 
berries add one slice canned pine- 
apple or its equivalent in fresh pine- 
apple, cut in cubes. Arrange on 
lettuce leaves. Add cream salad dress- 
ing.

The following boiled salad dressing 
is a foundation recipe: 

1/2 teaspoon mustard 

1 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon flour 

1 egg 

1/2 cup milk 

1 tablespoon butter 

1/^ cup weak vinegar 

Mix all dry ingredients, beat the 
egg and add with the butter and milk 
to the dry ingredients; cook over hot 
water; strain until thick like corn- 
starch, then add the vinegar and cool. 

To make Cream Dressing add 1 
tablespoon whipped cream and 2 ta- 
blespoons of the boiled dressing. This 
dressing may be used to good advan- 
tage in vegetable salads by adding 
1 tablespoon of oil to each tablespoon 
of boiled dressing. 

Tomato Jelly Salad 

One can tomatoes, one sliced onion, 
one-half cup chopped celery, teaspoon 
salt, dash pepper, one-half box gela- 
tine, juice of one lemon. 

Put tomatoes in a saucepan with 
the onion, celery and seasoning; bring 
to the boiling point and add gelatine 
that has been soaked for half an 
hour in one-half cup of cold water; 
strain, add lemon juice and turn at 
once into small moulds or after-din- 
ner coffee cups. When ready to serve, 
dip these quickly into boiling water 
and turn out the jelly on a bed of 
either finely chopped celery or lettuce 
leaves. Use mayonnaise dressing. 

A Vegetable Salad 

The foundation for this salad may 
be made from almost any cold cooked 
vegetables that remain in the refrig- 
erator. A good combination, how- 
ever, is potato, peas, celery, carrots 
and turnips. The tubers should be

cut in cubes and cooked in salted wa- 
ter until tender if they are not al- 
ready cooked. After the vegetables 
are mixed together, a French salad 
dressing should be put over them, 
using two tablespoons of the dress- 
ing to one cup of the vegetables. 
This mixture should stand for at least 
half an hour before the salad is 
served. Arrange each portion on let- 
tuce leaves and add a spoonful of 
mayonnaise. Some prefer the addi- 
tion of a cream salad dressing instead 
of the mayonnaise. Those who like 
to retain the strong flavor of the veg- 
etables use only the French dressing. 



Rice and Milk for Breakfast 

Seven-eighth cup rice, whole or 
broken; one quart milk, whole or 
skimmed; one-quarter cup sugar, 
one teaspoon salt, few gratings of 
nutmeg. 

Use a little less broken rice than 
whole rice. Wash the rice well and 
cook with milk, sugar and salt in the 
double boiler until the rice is soft and 
has absorbed most of the milk. Stir 
occasionally with a fork in order to 
prevent the rice from sinking to the 
bottom and to make the liquid 
creamy. Add nutmeg just before 
taking from the fire. 

Serve hot with cream, or omit the 
nutmeg and serve with brown sugar. 
In summer use a little more milk and 
serve cold with crushed or sliced 
fruits. 

Creamed Rice 

Add a little more sugar to the 
above mixture and use a little less 
rice in order to obtain creamed rice, 
which is the basis of many simple but 
dainty desserts. For example, when 
nearly cold, stir in the whites of two

eggs or a little whipped cream, to- 
gether with broken nut meats or can- 
died fruits; or serve in tall glasses 
with a spoonful of preserves or jam 
on top, and garnish with whipped 
cream. Preserved ginger is especial- 
ly good with this dessert. 

Rice 

Rice Instead of Potatoes. 

In substituting rice for potatoes 
great care must be taken in cooking 
the rice to have the kernels dry and 
mealy or separate instead of soggy 
and heavy. The first important point 
is to wash the rice through six or 
seven waters, rubbing the grains 
with the hands to get all the starch 
off. Then have a good-sized kettle 
with plenty of boiling water in it over 
a hot fire where it will boil fast. 
Drain the washed rice and drop into 
the boiling salted water and let boil 
rapidly 15 or 20 minutes or until the 
kernels are soft when pressed be- 
tween the fingers. Drain off every bit 
of water, cover with one thickness of 
cheesecloth and set aside to steam for 
10 or 15 minutes. Serve in an un- 
covered dish. 

Southern cooks wash the rice as 
directed above and then put it in a 
saucepan with a pint of water to each 
cup of rice and let it boil away. 
The kettle is then drawn to the side 
of the range and the cover partly re- 
moved to let the steam escape. It is 
kept there until steamed thoroughly 
dry. The rice must not be touched 
while it is cooking. For an experi- 
enced cook this recipe is all right, but 
the woman who is just learning had 
better try the first method, as rice 
scorches easily. 

Savory Rice 

Two tablespoonfuls butter or beef 
suet, browned and well seasoned; six 
tablespoons boiled rice, four table- 
spoons chopped cooked carrots, three

tablespoons grated cheese, one 
chopped hard-boiled egg, milk. Melt 
the butter (or suet) and add the 
rice, carrots, cheese and egg. Moisten 
with milk and season well. 

Rice Water for Invalids 

Two tablespoons rice, three cups 
cold water, milk, salt. Wash the" 
rice, add the cold water and soak for 
30 minutes. Bring gradually to the 
boiling point and cook for one hour, 
or until tender. Strain, reheat and 
dilute with hot water or hot milk. 
Season with salt. Add sugar if de- 
sired. 

Oatmeal for Invalids 

Cook oatmeal for an hour as for 
breakfast, then rub through sieve; 
add a little milk and cook in a double 
boiler for half an hour until perfectly 
smooth. Add a pinch of salt and a 
little cream. This is both nourishing 
and delicate. 



Curry Powder and Pungent Sauces Girt 
Variety to Meats and Vegetables. 

Curried Vegetables 

Mix together one cup potatoes, one 
cup carrots, one-half cup turnips. 
These vegetables, of course, should 
be cooked, cooled and cut in dice. 
Make a white sauce, then season 
with slices of onion which have 
been fried in drippings and one-half 
teaspoon salt; add one-half teaspoon 
curry powder and one-half cup of 
cooked peas to each cup of white 
sauce. Pour over the diced vege- 
tables and cook five or ten minutes.

Sauce Hollandaise 

4 tablespoons tarragon vinegar. 
1 bay leaf (small). 
1 tablespoon chopped onion. 
Celery seed, sprig of parsley. 

Boil until reduced one-half, then 
strain out the seasonings. Rub to- 
gether two tablespoons butter and 
two tablespoons flour and add slowly 
one cup of boiling water. Stir over 
the fire until it thickens, remove and 
add slowly to the yolks of two eggs 
slightly beaten. Cook the mixture 
a few minutes longer over hot 
water, being careful to stir constantly. 
Add salt and pepper, another table- 
spoon of butter cut into bits and the 
vinegar. 



Horseradish Sauce 

One tablespoon cornstarch to one 
cup of cold water or liquid in which 
meat has been boiled; blend thor- 
oughly and cook until smooth ; add 
two tablespoons of grated horseradish 
and serve either hot or cold. This 
is particularly good to serve with 
boiled beef or with a boiled dinner. 
It may be varied by coloring the 
sauce with beet juice. Ordinary 
horseradish may also be made pink 
and attractive in color to use with 
white meats by adding a little beet 
juice to the horseradish when mixing 
it with the vinegar.

DESSERTS 

In planning the dessert for the 
meal, one must consider the food 
value of the ingredients as well as the 
fuel value of the entire meal. That 
is, where there is a heavy meat dish 
or other dishes which furnish a great 
deal of fuel to the body, the dessert 
should be light and delicate. For in- 
stance, with a dinner consisting of a 
heavy roast, potatoes, succulent vege- 
tables and a salad, the dessert should 
be something like a fruit whip, tapioca 
fruit pudding, orange ice or some- 
thing of that character. If on the 
other hand, one has a meat saving 
dish or a scant supply of meat with 
few vegetables, it is wise to have a 
dessert rich in fats, carbohydrates 
and proteins. Such a dessert would 
be like a rice custard with raisins ; 
milk and eggs in the dessert will fur- 
nish body-building energy giving 
food, the rice furnishes carbohydrates 
and the raisins furnish sugar; all 
rich in fuel value. 

Baked Apples 

A good way to use small apples: 
Wash apples, cut them in moderately 
thick slices, not using core. Place a 
layer of these apples in a greased 
baking dish. Season with sugar, cin- 
namon and a little butterine, then add 
another layer, etc., until the dish is 
full. The best results are obtained by 
using a moderately shallow dish and 
using two layers of apples. Bake 
until the apples are done through and 
light brown on top. 

Apple Pie 

Line a plate with good paste. Fill 
with thin slices of good cooking ap- 
ples, sprinkle with 1/2 cup of sugar 
which has been mixed with a heaping 
teaspoon of flour and a pinch of salt; 
cover with an upper crust and bake 
in moderate oven for half an hour.

this is to be served with whipped 
cream, it is well to save a few whole 
berries to put on top of the shortcake. 
Just before serving the shortcake, in 
this case, cover the top of the short- 
cake with whipped cream and dot with 
the whole berries. Where whipped 
cream is not to be used, a cream sauce 
may be used, or a strawberry sauce to 
be poured over each portion when it

oven for about five minutes to dry off 
the dates, then remove the stones and 
cut the flesh of each into three or 
four pieces; to these add the juice of 
half a lemon, one-quarter cup of 
sugar, one-half cup of orange juice 
or other fruit juice and one-quarter 
package of gelatine, softened in one- 
quarter cupful of boiling water. Have 
ready about a dozen dates reserved 
whole when the dates were stoned. 
Put half an almond in each date and 
use to decorate a mould. Mix the 
rest of the almonds with the date and 
gelatine mixture and when slightly 
chilled mix thoroughly and turn into 
a mould. Serve with cream sweet- 
ened and flavored to taste. 

Vanilla Ice Cream 

2 cups milk. 

1 tablespoon flour, corn flour or 

cornstarch. 
1 cup sugar. 
1 egg. 

Vn teaspoon salt. 
1 quart thin cream. 
2^2 tablespoons vanilla. 

Scald milk in double boiler. Mix 
flour, sugar and salt together and add 
the egg slightly beaten. Pour this 
into milk gradually and cook 15 min- 
utes, stirring to keep from lumps. If 
custard appears to curdle, it will not 
matter, as this will disappear in freez- 
ing. When cool add the thin cream 
and vanilla. Strain and freeze. 

This is a foundation recipe for one 
kind of ice cream, and may be varied 
by adding other flavorings. For in- 
stance, chocolate ice cream. For this, 
dissolve two squares of chocolate over 
hot water. Put this into the hot cus- 
tard slowly. In such cases, the flavor- 
ing should be put into the custard be- 
fore the cream is put into it. One may 
use berries, pineapple, coffee, orange 
or anything that one prefers. 

In freezing the ice cream, one must 
allow three measures of ice to one of

salt. Pack in alternate layers until 
the ice and salt come to the top of the 
can. This packing should be as solid 
as possible. If one wishes to freeze 
only a small quantity in a large mixer 
then the salt and ice need only come 
a little higher in the tub than the 
mixture to be frozen. It is wise to 
fill the can only three-quarters full, 
because the mixture increases in bulk 
while freezing. If you have too much 
cream in your can, it will be coarse 
grained. The can should be turned 
slowly and steadily at first, then as it 
becomes slightly frozen it may be 
turned more readily. When frozen 
the water should be drawn off, dash- 
ers taken out and the cream should be 
packed solidly with a spoon. 

If the cream is to stand any length 
of time, the ice and the salt should be 
repacked, using four times as much 
ice as salt. When repacked the can 
should be covered with a newspaper 
or a piece of old carpet until ready to 
be served.

Orange Ice 

Boil four cups of water and two 
cups of sugar 10 minutes. Add 
two cups of orange juice, the juice 
of one lemon. Strain and freeze. 
The grated rind of an orange may be 
added before straining if desired. To 
make lemon ice, add the juice of four 
lemons and one orange to the amount 
of sugar and water given above. In 
freezing ices, as well as sherbet and 
creams, use three level measures of 
crushed ice to one of coarse rock salt, 
and repeat until ice and salt come 
above the mixture to be frozen. If 
too much rock salt is used the mixture 
will freeze too rapidly and will be 
coarse in texture. 

In using other fruit juices they 
should be well sweetened before 
freezing, as they taste less sweet 
after. 

Orange Cream 

This is delicious served plain or 
combined with sponge cake. To make 
the cream, cook one cup of sugar, two 
of orange juice and one-half cup of 
lemon juice until a light syrup is 
gained. Then turn it very slowly on 
to the beaten yolks of four eggs, 
whipping all the time. Add to this 
one and one-quarter tablespoons of 
granulated gelatine which has been 
soaked half an hour in one-quarter 
cup of cold water. Cook a little 
while, strain, beat and add the whites 
of four eggs and beat until it stiffens. 
Turn into a mold. Whipped cream 
may be added instead of white of 
eggs. 

Orange Milk Sherbet 

Orange in milk sherbet makes a 
pleasing dessert which may be made 
without much trouble. 

Four cups of milk, one and one- 
half cups of sugar, juice of one 
lemon, two oranges. Mix juice and

sugar and add milk slowly while 
stirring. If it should curdle it will 
do no harm. Freeze and serve with 
macaroons. 

Orange Fritters 

To make fritters, divide the orange 
in sections. Dip each section in bat- 
ter and fry a light brown in deep fat. 
Surprise doughnuts may be made by 
rolling out rather thin squares of " 
doughnut dough and placing a spoon 
of orange .marmalade on it, then 
fold over and fry, like regular dough- 
nuts. 

Orange Custard 

Orange custard is made by arrang- 
ing slices of orange in a glass dish 
and pouring boiled custard over them. 
The beaten white of an egg sweet- 
ened and dropped by spoons over 
the top makes the dish more attrac- 
tive in appearance. 

Baked Peaches 

Baked peaches make a pleasing 
change at times. 

Peel peaches, cut in halves and 
place in a shallow porcelain or glass 
baking dish. Fill the cavities of the 
peaches where the stones have been 
removed with sugar, a bit of butter, 
a few drops of lemon juice and a 
little grated nutmeg. Bake until the 
peaches are tender when pierced with 
a silver fork, which will take about 
20 minutes. Serve in the dish in 
which they are baked. Sponge cake 
or lady fingers are nice to serve with 
this dish. 

Peach Frozen Pudding 

Ripe, well-mashed and sweetened 
peaches lend themselves well to add 
to any kind of ice cream or frozen 
pudding. A good proportion for ice 
cream is one cup of heavy cream, 
one cup of thin cream, two cups 
of mashed peaches and sugar to taste.

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

It must be remembered that the mix- 
ture tastes less sweet after freezing, 
so that it must be quite sweet before. 

Peach Mousse 

Peach syrup may be used in making 
peach mousse. 

1 tablespoon granulated gelatine. 
14 cup of cold water. 

1 cup peach syrup. 

2 tablespoons lemon juice. 
1 cup of sugar. 

1 quart of cream. 

Have the syrup hot and add to it 
the gelatine (which has been dis- 
solved thoroughly in cold water), the 
lemon juice and the sugar. While 
this is cooling, whip the cream stiff 
and then turn it into a sieve to drain. 
When the mixture begins to thicken 
turn the whip from the cream into it 
and put into a mold. Pack in salt 
and ice and let stand four hours. 

Points for Pears 

Pears lend themselves to a number 
of delicious dishes, and for that rea- 
son, as well as for their laxative 
qualities, they should be included in 
the list for the family fruit closet. 
They are quite similar in food value 
to apples, but are considered more 
easily digested, and also contain much 
less acid. 

Stewed Pears 

Pare, cut in halves and remove 
cores. Cook until tender over a low 
fire with just enough water to keep 
them from sticking to the stewpan. 
When the pears can be pierced with 
a silver fork, add sugar to taste and 
put in three or four pieces of pre- 
served ginger. Cook five to ten min- 
utes longer. If no ginger is at hand 
a few slices of candied orange peel or 
citron may be used instead. 

If you keep a fire in your range over 
night, try stewing pears in a stone- 
ware jar or crock. Prick hard bak- 
ing pears with a fork in several places

■ 

and fill a jar or your casserole with 
them. Add one cup sugar, one cup 
water and a teaspoon of molasses. 
Cover tightly and bake all night. This 
dish should be prepared in time to 
place it in the oven while it is still 
hot ; otherwise the fire will be too low 
during the night to start the cooking 
properly. 

Prune Whip 

14 lb. prunes (stewed). 
3 whites of eggs. 
14 cup powdered sugar. 
1 tablespoon lemon juice. 

Beat the whites of eggs until stiff, 
then add gradually the powdered su- 
gar and prunes, which have been cut 
into small pieces and mixed with the 
lemon juice. Arrange in serving 
dishes and serve with whipped cream 
or a soft custard. 

Other fruits may be used iri place 
of prunes, such as apricots, peaches 
or pineapple. 

Pecan Pudding 

Nuts are nutritious and may be 
used in different forms that are eas- 
ily prepared. A pudding much liked 
in the South may be made as follows : 

One pint pecans, chopped fine or 
run through a meat cutter; one full 
cup of mashed cooked rice, three 
eggs, add yolks to nuts and rice, 
sweeten to taste; sweet milk enough 
to make consistency of custard. Bake 
until set. Beat whites of eggs, put 
on top and brown lightly. This pud- 
ding is delicious with whipped cream, 
but may be eaten with liquid sauce 
having preferred flavoring. Other 
nuts may be used in place of pecans. 

Pineapple Tapioca 

Pineapple tapioca is made by mix- 
ing one-half cup of minute tapioca, 
one-half cup of sugar and a pinch 
of salt together and adding slowly to 
three cups of boiling water. Cook 
in the double boiler 15 minutes and

then pour over two cups of shred- 
ded pineapple. Decorate the top of 
the pudding with any kind of jelly 
or preserves that you like. 

Pineapple Ice is refreshing and 
also is easily made by boiling three- 
quarters of a cup of sugar with three 
cups of water for three or four min- 
utes, then adding two cups grated 
pineapple, six tablespoons of lemon 
juice; cool, strain and freeze. This 
will serve six persons. 

Snow Pudding and Fruit Sauce 

1 tablespoon granulated gelatine. 
l^ cup cold water. 

whites of 3 eggs. 
1 cup boiling water. 
1 cup sugar. 
14 cup lemon juice. 

Soak the gelatine in cold water, 
dissolve in the hot water; add lemon 
juice and sugar and stir well to dis- 
solve thoroughly. 

Strain and set aside to cool ; stir 
mixture occasionally; and when quite 
thick beat with a wire whisk or Dover 
egg beater until frothy; add well- 
beaten whites of the eggs and con- 
tinue beating until quite stiff. Set 
on ice to chill, serve with a sauce 
made by slightly crushing a cup and 
a half of strawberries with one-half 
cup of sugar. 

Strawberry Pudding 

Fill a baking dish with berries, 
sweeten to taste and add two or three 
dots of butter. Make biscuit dough as 
for Strawberry Shortcake, recipe 
given above. Roll one-quarter inch 
thick, cut at two or three places to 
let the steam escape and place over 
the berries in a baking dish. Bake in 
a moderately hot oven 20 to 30 min- 
utes. When berries are not plentiful, 
one may use one-third apple and two- 
thirds berries in this pudding, or one 
may use one-third rhubarb and two- 
thirds berries.

Strawberry Sauce 

1 tablespoon cornstarch 
% cup water 
1 tablespoon sugar 
1 tablespoon butter 

Dissolve the starch in the water, 
add the butter and sugar, and cook 
until smooth, then add crushed and 
sweetened berries. Delicious straw- 
berry pie may be made by baking a 
layer of pastry made of corn flour and 
wheat flour 50-50. This crust should 
be rolled medium thin and baked over 
an inverted pie pan, then fill with part- 
ly crushed and sweetened berries and 
cover with either meringue or with 
whipped cream. 

Tapioca Peach Pudding 

Line a buttered baking dish with 
pared and sliced peaches. Soak a cup 
of tapioca in hot water enough to 
cover for an hour or more. Sweeten 
and flavor and pour over the fruit. 
Bake in a moderate oven for a half 
hour or until the peaches are done. If 
minute tapioca is used it needs no 
soaking. Apples may be used in place 
of peaches. 

Tapioca Cream 

1/4 cup tapioca, either pearl or min- 
ute. 
2 cups of scalded milk. 
2 eggs. 
Ys cup sugar. 

pinch of salt. 
1 teaspoon vanilla. 

Soak pearl tapioca in cold water. 
If minute tapioca is used add it to 
milk and cook in double boiler until 
transparent. Add sugar to egg yolks, 
slightly beaten, and then gradually 
beat into the hot mixture and cook 
until the mixture thickens. Whip in 
whites of eggs beaten stiff, chill and 
flavor.

BEVERAGES 

We think of beverages as some- 
thing to tickle the palate and quench 
the thirst. They do that, but many 
of them also assist in nutrition. For 
foods may be liquid as well as solid. 
We can gain nourishment sipping 
from a glass or drinking through a 
tube just as well as from eating large 
slices of meat and heaped-up quan- 
tities of vegetables. 

In some beverages there is a de- 
cided and substantial addition to the 
number of calories which are neces- 
sary to keep up health and energy. 
Under this head comes milk, butter- 
milk, cocoa, chocolate, kumiss, whey 
and others which are widely adver- 
tised. In summer nutrition in bever- 
ages is well worth our attention, be- 
cause they are not only easily assim- 
ilated, but they also may be made re- 
freshing and cooling. The liquids 
mentioned should be considered, how- 
ever, more in the light of foods than 
of something to quench the thirst, al- 
though they may and do often com- 
bine both qualities. A glass of cold 
milk or buttermilk will quench the 
thirst sometimes when nothing else 
appears to be able to do so. If with 
the glass of milk we have some bread 
and butter, preferably barley bread, 
corn flour bread, or rye bread, a dish 
of fruit and a crisp vegetable, we have 
a meal complete in itself so far as the 
amount of protein, carbohydrate, 
mineral matter and fat are concerned. 

At the same time we have a meal that 
does not overtax the body in order to 
take care of it, which does not furnish 
too much fuel for heat in hot weath- 
er, but which does furnish the proper- 
number of calories necessary for 
moderate healthy work. Those who 
work out of doors at manual labor, in 
their gardens, perhaps, may need to 
increase the amount.

On cool summer days a cup of hot 
chocolate with whipped cream, some 
slices of corn flour bread with peanut 
butter, or corn bread with butter and 
a dish of fruit, is all that is necessary. 

In certain other summer beverages 
the number of calories is almost neg- 
ligible, but the beverages are equally 
favorable in regard to nutrition, be- 
cause they furnish vitamines, the 
elusive something that food scientists 
cannot see, but which they know 
must be furnished in the food. For 
if vitamines are lacking, children do 
not grow properly and have rickets, 
become anaemic; grown people lose 
their health and may have pellagra or 
beri-beri. Among the vitamine rich 
beverages are orangeade, lemonade, 
limeade and fruit punches. Raw milk 
also is rich in vitamines, but as that 
has been considered under the head 
of the nourishing beverages, it is not 
placed in this list. Lemonade, of 
course, is the most popular and prob- 
ably the most easily prepared of all 
the summer drinks. There is only 
one drawback to its general use. 
Those who have a tendency to rheu- 
matism or uric acid may find it in- 
creasing the acid condition. In fact, 
lemons, grapefruit and strawberries 
are the three thhigs that physicians 
almost invariably eliminate from the 
diet of anyone addicted to rheuma- 
tism or uric acid. Orangeade, on the 
other hand, appears to have no effect 
at all on the acid condition of the 
body and does very materially in- 
crease the amount of vitamines in the 
food content. Orangeade is easily 
assimilated by children and invalids 
and forms a healthful addition to 
their diet, even when taken as pure 
orange juice, or when diluted with 
water with a little sugar added. It 
would be a splendid thing if all babies 
and little children could have during 
the hot weather the juice of at least 
one-half an orange given plain, or in

orangeade, between meals. This 
would not only quench their thirst, 
but would be in the nature of a tonic. 
Fruit punch is a joy, particularly to 
children. Wise mothers will keep it 
on tap. This is not hard to do, either, 
because one may squeeze out the 
juice of oranges and lemons and keep 
them in a jar in the refrigerator for 
at least two days. Then to this juice 
a bit of fresh fruit, either cooked or 
raw, may be added to change the 
flavor. If the fruit is fresh it should 
be mashed before putting into the 
punch. Sometimes half a bottle of 
ginger ale or root beer will give a 
pleasing flavor to the fruit punch. 
Then, again, a cup of cold tea makes 
a delicious addition for grown-ups. 
With berries, pineapples and other 
fruits one may change the character 
of the beverage so that the family 
will have a variety and find pleasure 
in what seems to them a new kind of 
punch. Oftentimes, when fresh fruits 
are not available, one may have re- 
source to the fruit closet and use a 
little of the canned products. Cher- 
ries are particularly good to use in 
combination with oranges and lem- 
ons. Some mothers who know the 
value of fruit punches make an effort 
to have plenty of fruit juice canned 
in small jars, pint and half-pint sizes, 
ready for the emergency of making 
a cooling drink in a hurry. 

In addition to fruit punches, there 
are other delicious fruit beverages 
which may be made in the summer 
and kept for use throughout the year, 
such as strawberry shrub, raspberry 
vinegar and blackberry cordial. If 
you have never tried putting up any 
of these things, make an experiment 
this summer. One may be so much 
more hospitable if they have some- 
thing in the pantry or on the fruit 
shelves with which they can make a 
delicious and cooling beverage to

give to the tired caller or newly ar- 
rived guest, who has come into one's 
home from the hot sun and heated 
pavements. This is one thing that 
every housewife can do this summer. 
She can be a Red Cross nurse in her 
own home, standing ready to give as 
much refreshment for the body and 
mind as she is able. Being ready 
and doing all she can to make those 
comfortable who are around' her 
shows that she is heeding her call 
to patriotic duty. 



Oranges 

Although both oranges and lemons 
belong to the same family, the citrus, 
they are enough unlike to supplement 
each other as well as to combine in 
giving flavors to foods. If your 
physician says you have too much 
uric acid to take lemons he'll proba- 
bly tell you to eat plenty of oranges, 
and may advise you to take the juice 
of an orange every time you are 
thirsty, instead of a drink of water. 
Speaking of orange juice, it is a 
splendid thing to give to children. 
Holt, one of our authorities, says that 
many infants are benefited in their 
nutrition by small quantities of or- 
ange juice when they are 5 or 6 
months old. Two or three teaspoon- 
fuls of juice should be given an hour 
before meals. This should be in- 
creased so that by the time they are 
a year old two or three tablespoon- 
fuls may be given. The juice should 
be strained, of course, and it should 
be sweet and fresh. 

Lemon juice is used instead of 
vinegar, not only on fish, baked and 
fresh spinach, cabbage and other 
similar dishes, but also in making 
salad dressing, both French and 
mayonnaise. The proportion used 
being in most cases one tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice to three of oil.

Grape Juice 

Wash grapes in colander and pick 
from stems. Put fruit in granite or 
porcelain-lined kettle and add one 
cup of water to each quart of grapes. 
Heat slowly, mash fruit lightly and 
cook gently for 20 to 30 minutes. 
Drain through a double cheesecloth 
lightly to get all the juice. Put the 
juice in the preserving kettle and 
let come to the boiling point, then 
draw kettle from the fire to skim. 
Do this twice, then add sugar in the 
proportions of one-half cup to each 
quart of juice. When the sugar has 
dissolved, which will take about five 
minutes, skim carefully and pour into 
hot sterilized jars or bottles and seal. 
The finest grape juice may be made 
from a grape called the Ives Seedling. 

Use one cup of water to four 
quarts of grapes. Just enough to get 
the grapes started cooking. Then 
proceed as above, except that no 
sugar need be added. The grape 
juice should be sealed in bottles with 
rubber fasteners, and it will be just 
sweet enough for a mildly acid drink. 



Currant Shrub 

Heat two quarts of ripe currants, 
then strain through a jelly bag. To 
each quart of juice add three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar and stir until 
dissolved. Add the juice of one lemon 
and dilute with cold water. Place on 
ice. When ready to serve pour over 
cracked ice and ornament each glass 
with a bunch of ripe currants or a 
slice of lemon. 



Raspberry Vinegar 

A pleasant drink in hot weather 
and' a fine ingredient for fruit punch 
and for making salads in winter is 
raspberry vinegar, which may be 
made as follows :

Put four quarts of raspberries in 
a bowl and pour over tliem two 
quarts of vinegar. Cover and set in 
a cool place two days. On the sec- 
ond day strain the vinegar through 
cheesecloth. Put four quarts of 
fresh raspberries in the bowl and 
pour over them the vinegar strained 
from the first raspberries. Put in a 
cool place for two days, then strain. 
Put the strained juice in a preserving 
kettle with three pounds of sugar. 
Heat slowly and when the vinegar 
boils skim carefully. Boil 20 minutes 
then put in sterilized bottles. The 
berries may be spiced and preserved. 

About two tablespoons of raspberry 
vinegar to a glass of water makes a 
refreshing drink. 

Similar vinegars may be made 
from blackberries and strawberries.

JELLIES 

We have considered jellies and pre- 
serves as luxurious adjuncts to our 
meals. They really have great food 
value as energy furnishers in a con- 
centrated form. 

To Put Up Good Jelly 

With sugar constantly increasing 
in price one cannot afford many ex- 
periments in jelly-making. It is bet- 
ter to go about the business of mak- 
ing jelly with some clear ideas that 
will make success more certain. 
There is nothing more attractive in 
appearance nor more satisfying in 
taste than a dish of home-made jelly 
which is clear, which keeps its shape 
while being "quivery." On the other 
hand, ropy, thick or tough jelly ap- 
peals to no one. Neither is it pleas- 
ant to set your teeth on edge with 
crystals in jelly. To get jelly of the 
right consistency and free from crys- 
tals is the problem not only of the 
young housewife but also of the ma- 
ture one. Two questions often 
asked of the Domestic Science ex- 
perts are : "What makes crystals 
form in my jelly?" and "Why doesn't 
my jelly harden?" 

Causes of Crystallization 

In reply to the first question, about 
the crystallization, there are two 
points to consider. There may be 
too much sugar in proportion to the 
juice, or the jelly may have been 
, boiled too hard. Some fruits have 
more sugar than others; currants, 
for instance, have four or five times 
as much sugar as the peach. Yet 
to the taste peaches seem much sweet- 
er than currants. Grapes have the 
most sugar of any of the fruits, and 
grape jelly is more apt to have crys- 
tals form than other fruits. Another 
factor that comes into jelly-making

is the weather. In hot, dry seasons, 
with plenty of sunshine, the fruits, 
particularly berries, have more sugar 
than usual, and this should be taken 
into account when measuring the 
fruit juice and sugar. The usual rule 
is pint for pint, or cup for cup. And 
that rule should be followed when we 
have a cold, wet season, without a 
great deal of sunshine. If, on the 
other hand, we had had little rain, 
plenty of hot weather, it would be 
better to use less, i. e., to each pint of 
juice add a good three-quarters pint 
of sugar. Sometimes too rapid boil- 
ing causes the particles of jelly to be 
thrown up on the sides of the kettle, 
where crystals are formed, and then 
either pushed down into the kettle 
or fall down, and these crystals later 
will start others to form. To avoid 
crystals, measure the sugar carefully 
and take care to have the jelly boil 
slowly. 

As to Hardening 

Why jelly does not harden requires 
a different explanation. The fruit may 
be overripe, it may have been boiled 
too long, the fruit may not be the 
right kind, or too much may be boiled 
at a time. There is a substance in 
all fruits, when ripe or nearly ripe, 
that is called pectin, which is a carbo- 
hydrate, something quite similar to 
starch in its properties, and it is this 
pectin that enables us to make jelly. 
Equal quantities of fruit juice and 
sugar heated to the boiling point for 
a few minutes brings about a chemi- 
cal change, which causes the pectin 
in the fruit to gelatinize the mixture, 
and jelly is the result. Pectin, pec- 
tose, pectase all come from the Greek 
word meaning to coagulate or curdle. 
Through certain changes the pectic 
acid is made to form a jelly mass 
instead of curdling things. Pectose 
and pectase are always in unripe 
fruit. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

176

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— >l/u;a3's Reliable 

177 ' 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Pectose is supposed to form the 
bulk of vegetable jelly, the elemental 
qualities of which may be equal to 
the starches. Pectase is a substance 
present in the juices of plants. As 
fruits ripen the pectase acts on the 
pectose which cannot be dissolved 
and changes it so th^t it can be dis- 
solved, changing the pectose into pec- 
tin. Now the important point for 
the jellymaker to remember is that 
this pectin is always at its best just 
when the fruit is ripe, or a little be- 
fore. If the fruit is overripe, if it 
begins to ferment a bit, if the jelly 
is cooked too long, then the pectin 
undergoes a change and loses its 
power to gelatinize, and the jelly does 
not harden. Choose fruit that is just 
ripe or a little green, and you will 
have better success than with the 
overripe fruit. 

When Pectin is Needed 

The amount of pectin changes in 
the different fruits, just as sugar 
does. In the strawberry, for instance, 
the quantity of the jellymaking pectin 
is so small that it is difficult to make 
jelly from strawberries. Apples or 
currants may be added to make a 
jelly in which some of the flavor of 
strawberries may be obtained. In- 
deed, I have always found that to get 
good results with peaches it is better 
to add apples or grapes. The peach 
is often given in jellymaking lists, 
but I would advise new jellymakers 
to let the peach alone at first or use 
it with something else that is easy 
to make jelly from. If you chance to 
have some currant juice canned, add 
a fourth proportion of that. The 
best fruits for making jelly are cur- 
rant, crabapple, apple, quince, orrape, 
blackberry and raspberry. If you 
wish to have success with cherry 
jelly add currants or apples if you 
want real jelly. Of course some of 
the cherry flavor will be lost.

Pure Juice Jelly 

Many housewives prefer to make 
jelly from juicy fruits, such as cur- 
rants, raspberries, blackberries and 
grapes, without adding any water 
when cooking the fruit to extract the 
juice. They mash a little of the fruit 
in the bottom of the kettle first and 
then put in the rest of it. The kettle 
is placed over a low fire and heated 
gradually, so that the juice will be 
extracted enough to cook the berries 
or currants. Other housewives say 
that they add a little water to start 
the fruit cooking. I find from experi- 
ment that this works very well, par- 
ticularly with currants, provided the 
jelly is cooked in a way that I will 
discuss later. Indeed, my experience 
is that I had more jelly and with a 
more delicate flavor. The propor- 
tions were one pint of water to four 
quarts of currants. The fruit was 
washed, drained and then placed in 
an agate kettle with a pint of hot 
water poured over it. The fruit was 
cooked rather slowly until it was soft, 
and then it was thoroughly mashed 
with a potato masher. It was poured 
into a jelly bag made of coarse mus- 
lin and allowed to drain over night. 
The next morning the clear juice was 
taken and cup for cup of sugar add- 
ed. When the sugar had dissolved, or 
almost so, it was put over the fire and 
heated gradually to the boiling point, 
where it was allowed to boil gently 
from 10 to 15 minutes. I tried it by 
dipping a teaspoon of the mixture 
on a cold plate, and when I found 
that it rolled from this plate, that is, 
when it showed that it was jellying, 
I poured it into the jelly glasses and 
set away to cool. 

But I only cooked a little of it at a 
time. And it is to that fact that I 
ascribe my success. Indeed, cooking 
a little at a time is one of the things 
that I consider essential in making

ISO

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

fine jelly. I never put more than 
three cups to cook in one kettle. 
When I am making a good deal of 
jelly at one time 1 have found it neces- 
sary to keep two or three kettles 
going at once, which may be done 
without difficulty by starting one a 
few minutes later than the other. 
Then the skimming off of the scum 
that rises to the top and the testing 
on the plate may be done one kettle 
after the .other. The jelly glasses 
should be sterilized, dried and kept 
hot to avoid ferment and mold later. 



As to Clarity 

If you have a sunny window in 
your kitchen it is a good plan to set 
the glasses in it for a day, covering 
them with a pane of glass, or wax 
paper, and then pouring paraffine 
over them. The paraffine may be 
handled easily by putting it in a small 
coffee pot or teapot, which may be 
bought at 5 or 10 cents, and melting 
it in this over a low flame or heat, 
and then pouring a thin coating over 
each glass, being careful to entirely 
cover the jelly. 

By using the juice that drains out 
without squeezing the jelly bag you 
will have a clear jelly. If you wish 
this extra transparent, use a flannel 
bag to drain the juice. After the 
first juice has been used the jelly 
bag may be squeezed and that juice 
used to make jelly that will not look 
clear, but will taste just as good. 
Or if this is not desirable, the fruit 
in the jelly bag may be turned into 
a sieve and the pulp rubbed through, 
to be used in making marmalade. But 
where there are children in the fam- 
ily jelly that is not clear will not 
receive harsh criticism.

Wild Cherry Jelly 

If you never tried making wild 
cherry jelly, make a note to remind 
yourself that it is well worth trying 
next year. Wild cherries should be 
combined with apples. Use half and 
half. Add enough water to barely 
cover apples and cherries and cook 
until fruit is tender. Mash well and 
then drain through double cheese- 
cloth over night. The juice that drips 
through will make clear jelly, and the 
juice may be squeezed out of the rest 
of the fruit for less clear jelly. Put 
three cups of juice and three cups 
of sugar in a saucepan and heat 
gradually until the sugar is dissolved. 
Boil 10 or 15 minutes, or until the 
mixture rolls up with a spoon on a 
saucer. Pour in jelly glasses, let 
stand half a day and cover with melt- 
ed parafRne. By pouring a little jelly 
at a time in each glass there will not 
be any trouble with jelly glasses 
breaking. Heating them up gradual- 
ly allows the glass to expand as the 
quantity is increased. A spoon placed 
in the glass will help, but even then 
hot liquids should be poured in 
slowly. 



Grape Jelly 

If you are fortunate enough to get 
grapes just before they are ripe, you 
will have them at their best for jelly- 
making. Sometimes half-ripe grapes 
are brought to the markets and sold 
for that purpose at 10 cents a quart. 
Even at that price the jelly need not 
be so expensive, because one may 
combine with the grapes apple par- 
ings and two or three small apples. 
In this way more jelly may be made 
without spoiling the grape flavor. 
Wild grapes are especially fine, as 
they have a "tang" that makes the 
jelly very nice to serve with sliced 
cold meats, particularly lamb or veal.

Peach Jelly 

In making jelly from peaches it is 
well to add one-fourth part tart ap- 
ples to the peaches. For making 
jelly, also, the small fruit and the im- 
perfect (imperfect in shape, not de- 
cayed) fruit should be used, and the 
apples should be cooked with the 
peaches. Peaches have less pectin, 
the jelly-making substance, than ap- 
ples, and unless some fruit is added 
which is rich in pectin the jelly does 
not harden, but is left thin and 
"ropey." By using one-fourth apples 
the flavor of the peach jelly is not im- 
paired, and the substance is much 
improved. 

Peaches also are easily dried, pared 
and unpared, and as many as possi- 
ble should be kept that way this year. 
Soft fruit may be pared and made 
into old-fashioned "peach leather." 
This is done by mashing the fruit and 
drying it on platters in thin cakes. 
It may be sweetened or not before 
drying, just as one chooses. This 
• peach leather may be stored in boxes 
and then cooked up with a little water 
when it is to be used in the winter 
time. If it is sweetened before it is 
put away it is well to hide the box, 
or it may be mistaken for candy and 
eaten in the winter time. 

Peach Preserves 

Preserved peaches will keep their 
flavor better if they are pared and 
covered with sugar, about the propor- 
tion of one-third sugar to two-thirds 
peaches, and permitted to remain in 
this sugar over night, until the syrup 
draws. This syrup should be heated 
and poured over the peaches, then 
reheated, the peaches added to the 
syrup and cooked very slowly until 
they are tender when pricked with a 
silver fork, and until they are what 
is called translucent — that is, one can 
almost see through them.

Spiced Peaches 

Spiced peaches are better if they 
are pared and left whole. Clingstone 
peaches are the best for this purpose. 
They should be kept in sugar over 
night, in the same proportion* as 
stated above. Then, vi^hen cooked the 
next day, vinegar and spices should 
be added to the fruit. The amount of 
vinegar and spices should be deter- 
mined by the taste of the family' 
which will use the fruit. 



CONSERVES 

Carrot and Pineapple 

One cup ground carrot, one cup 
pineapple, shredded. Cook until 
tender. Add one cup sugar, one 
lemon, quartered and sliced very 
thin. Boil slowly until thick. Do not 
stir. Pack in hot jars and sterilize. 

Grape and Apple 

Take equal parts of grapes and 
apples, cook the grapes until the 
skins are tender and they may be 
rubbed through a sieve. Wash and 
quarter the apples, cook until tender 
and press through a colander, and 
then combine the pulp from the two 
fruits. Add one-quarter as much 
sugar as fruit pulp. Cook 10 or 15 
minutes and seal in glass jars. This 
makes a good sauce for winter. By 
adding one-third sugar and two- 
thirds fruit pulp, putting in spices to 
taste and cooking down until fairly 
thick, one may get a delicious con- 
serve. 

Catsups 

We think of catsup as something 
made from tomatoes, but most deli- 
cious catsup may be made from a num- 
ber of different fruits and vegetables. 
Apples, grapes, currants, gooseberries 
and mushrooms each made delicious 
catsup. These furnish a pleasing 
change in serving meats and are fine

to have on the emergency shelf, to use 
in place of sauce with roasts when 
there is no time to make them. 

To make currant catsup, take two 
pounds of currants, one pound of sugar, 
one cupful of vinegar, one teaspoonf ul 
each of cinnamon, cloves, pepper and 
allspice. Cook 20 minutes in a gran- 
ite saucepan, strain through a sieve, 
rubbing the pulp through and leaving 
only the skins. Then cook until as 
thick as ordinary catsup. Bottle and 
set away in a dark, cool place. 

For gooseberry catsup and grape 
catsup, proceed in the same manner. 

For apple catsup cook a dozen good- 
sized tart apples that have been wash- 
ed and quartered. When soft rub 
through a sieve and to each quart of 
pulp add one cupful of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful each of pepper, salt and mus- 
tard, two teaspoonfuls each of cloves, 
cinnamon and allspice, and one good- 
sized onion which has been grated 
and chopped quite fine. Cook slowly 
until thick enough to run from the 
bottle. Seal in pint glass jars. 

Cucumber catsup may be made 
without trouble by taking good-sized 
cucumbers, preparing as for the table, 
and then grating them or chopping 
extremely fine. Season to taste with 
salt; strain over night, and in the 
morning add pepper and vinegar, tak- 
ing care that the vinegar is not too 
sharp. Put in tight jars and seal for 
winter use. A tablespoonf ul of grated 
horseradish or a teaspoonful of mus- 
tard improves this catsup according 
to some tastes. 



SOME RELISHES 

Canapes 

Canapes (pronounced kanappees) 
make a good first course for a lunch- 
eon. They also furnish a fine way to 
use stale slices of bread and left- 
overs. The bread is cut into circles a

quarter of an inch thick and two and 
a half inches in diameter, or into 
strips four inches long and two inches 
wide. The slices are toasted or fried 
in hot fat, or dipped in butter and 
browned in the oven. Some seasoned 
mixture is then spread over them. 

Ham Canapes 

Cut bread into slices a quarter of. 
an inch thick, then with a small bis- 
cuit cutter into circles. Fry them in 
hot fat or saute them in butter or 
butterine. Pound some chopped ham 
to a paste, moisten it with milk or 
cream, spread it on the fried bread; 
dust with pepper, sprinkle the top 
with grated Parmesan cheese and 
place it in a hot oven until a little 
browned. Corn flour or cornmeal 
muffins may be used instead of bread. 

Green Tomato Pickle 

Green tomatoes make excellent 
pickles, either sweet or sour. For 
sweet pickles they have a prettier 
color and finer taste if they are used 
just before they turn in color. 

Cut the tomatoes, sprinkle lightly 
with salt, and let them remain over 
night. Drain thoroughly and put on 
to cook in an agate or porcelain ket- 
tle with sugar, vinegar and spices. 
One and one-half cups sugar, one 
tablespoon ground cinnamon, one tea- 
spoon mustard to three pints of 
medium sour vinegar is the right pro- 
portion to use for one peck green 
tomatoes. Allspice may be added, but 
makes the pickle darker. Cook very 
slowly until the tomatoes become al- 
most translucent; lift carefully in 
order to keep the slices whole, put in 
hot glass jars and seal. 

Tomato Relishes 

A relish that is easily made and 
which will keep for several days is 
made as follows: Chop six large, 
firm tomatoes moderately fine. Add

one bunch of celery chopped fine, one 
tablespoon of mustard seed, one table- 
spoon sugar and one teaspoon of cara- 
way seed and one cup of vinegar. 
Salt to taste. If caraway flavor is not 
liked, use a dash of pepper instead. 
This is a fine relish to use with cold 
meat. 

Green Tomato 

Chop one dozen fair-sized green 
tomatoes quite fine and sprinkle with 
salt. Let stand while chopping one 
small head of cabbage, one good-sized 
onion and two green peppers as fine 
as the tomatoes. Drain the tomatoes 
and mix with the other vegetables. 
Add two tablespoons of mustard seed, 
one teaspoon of celery salt, one- 
fourth teaspoon of ground pepper 
and two cups of vinegar. Salt to 
taste. If peppers are not at hand or 
not desired, use two good-sized cu- 
cumbers instead. 

Pickled Green Tomatoes 

One quart green tomatoes, one 
quart of cucumbers, one pint chopped 
onions, three large green peppers, 
one medium head of cabbage, chop- 
ped not too fine ; one cauliflower pick- 
ed apart. Put in kettle (porcelain- 
lined is best) and sprinkle salt 
through the mixture, using about one 
cup of salt in all. Add enough cold 
water to barely cover the mixture 
and let stand over night. Boil in the 
same water in the morning for 30 
minutes. Drain off the water. Make 
a paste of two cups of sugar, one-half 
tablespoon of mustard, two table- 
spoons of tumeric powder and a scant 
cup of flour. Mix dry ingredients 
together and add enough cold water 
to make a rather thin, smooth paste. 
To this add two quarts of boiling 
vinegar (not too sharp), put over fire 
and stir with a wooden spoon until 
mixture boils, then add vegetable 
mixture, boil 15 minutes and seal in 
glass jars.

CANNING FRUITS AND 
VEGETABLES 

To get the best results in canning 
with the least outlay of time and en- 
ergy, it is well to have a full canning 
outfit. Of course, one could get along 
with two kettles, a tablespoon, a ladle, 
jars, covers and rubbers, if necessary, 
but with the advanced and modern 
ideas in regard to canning it would be 
much better to have a boiling kettle, 
blanching kettle, sterilizing kettle, 
hot- water outfit, wire basket, jar 
lifter, lid lifter, measuring spoons, 
fruit funnel, as well as jars, lids and 
new rubbers. A word about jars and 
lids, too, may be helpful. These should 
be washed clean and should be ready, 
together with the lids. There should 
be three sizes of jars at least, and for 
a large family four sizes would be 
better, the two-quart, quart, pint and 
half -pint jars. One-half -pint jars, of 
course, are better for small families, 
but they may be used in large families 
for preserving sauces and portions of 
food that otherwise would have to be 
thrown away. These small portions 
may be used in flavoring and season- 
ing other foods. 

With everything at hand to do good 
work in canning, the next point to re- 
member is that everything must be 
absolutely clean, and, as far as the 
jars are concerned, surgically clean. 
It is by strict adherence to true clean- 
liness that the germs of bacteria are 
kept down. If the jars are clean and 
are filled to the very top while hot, if 
the lids are clean and hot, the rubbers 
clean and hot, there is very little dan- 
ger of having your fruit or vegetables 
spoil. 

The two best-known methods of 
canning fruits and vegetables are the 
open kettle and the cold pack. The 
open kettle is, of course, the old- 
fashioned way of cooking the fruits

or vegetables, then putting them in 
jars and sealing them. 

So far as fruit is concerned the open- 
kettle method is good for small quan- 
tities. For large amounts of fruit 
the cold pack is better. The latter 
method should be used in canning 
vegetables. 

The Cold-Pack Method 

This term is used because the food 
material is first scalded or blanched 
for a few minutes in boiling v^^ater, 
chilled by dipping at once into cold 
water, and then packed in the con- 
tainer, covered with liquid — either 
water, syrup or juice, that depending 
upon the food material being canned 
— the rubber put in place, the cover 
of the container put on lightly, not 
tightly, and the container placed in 
the canning outfit for sterilization. 
By this method the containers, rub- 
bers, and covers are previously 
washed but not necessarily sterilized. 
If new jars are used they may be put 
in warm water and allowed to heat 
gradually until the water reaches the 
boiling point. These should be al- 
lowed to cool slightly before they 
are packed with the food material. 
This process tempers the glass some- 
what and lessens the possibilities of 
breaking. 

There are a number of outfits which 
are used in the cold-pack method; 
first, there is the homemade outfit, 
which may be made from a washboil- 
er, tin pail, milk can, metal washtub 
or lard pail. These should have tight- 
fitting lids and also some kind of a 
false bottom made either of metal or 
wood to keep the jars from direct 
contact with the heat, and also to give 
a free circulation of water and steam 
around the jars. 

Then there is the water-seal outfit, 
which consists of a double-walled bath 
and cover which goes down into the

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

water between the outer and inner 
walls, thus making three metal walls 
and two water jackets. This is eco- 
nomical so far as heat is concerned. 
Then there is the steam pressure out- 
fit, which carries from five to thirty 
pounds of steam pressure. This pres- 
sure canner may be regulated easily 
so as to maintain different tempera- 
tures, and therefore it is very valu- 
able for use in canning vegetables or 
fruits. One advantage in buying the 
pressure canner is that it can be used 
both for canning during the canning 
season and as a cooker during the en- 
tire year. These cookers are light in 
construction and economical on heat, 
and wherever it is possible, each 
household should be provided with 
one. 

The following rules for canning 
vegetables will apply to such articles 
as wax beans, stringless beans, green 
peas, cabbage and Brussels sprouts. 
They should be prepared as for cook- 
ing, then placed in a piece of cheese- 
cloth and dipped in boiling water for 
three or four minutes, remove and 
blanch in cold water, pack in hot jars 
and add boiling hot water until jars 
or cans are filled. Add one table- 
spoon of salt to each quart, put 
rubbers and caps of jars in position 
but not tight; if tin cans are used, 
these should be sealed completely. 
Place in the cooker and boil for the 
time given below for the particular 
kind of outfit used. 

For a water bath, homemade or 
commercial, a water seal, li/^ hours. 

For a five-pound steam pressure, 
1 hour. 

For a 10-pound steam pressure, 40 
minutes. 

It will be seen from this table that 
the steam pressure does the quickest 
work. Vegetables such as lima beans 
or peas, or combinations of these, re- 
quire longer cooking.

In order to get the best results from 
home canning by the "One Period 
Cold-pack Method," one should have 
the "Farmers' Bulletin No. 839," dis- 
tributed by the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture. This bulletin 
gives complete and explicit directions 
for. canning vegetables, fruits and 
preserves and should be in every 
home. No matter what method of 
canning is used, the points to be re- 
membered are: That your fruit and 
vegetables must be fresh and free 
from decay and that everything about 
your canning must be absolutely 
clean. That you must can quickly and 
that everything must be boiling hot, 
and that you must have the proper 
utensils to use in canning. 

Canning Combinations 

Corn and Tomato Combination — 
Blanch fresh corn on the cob five 
minutes. Cold-dip quickly. Cut the 
corn from the cob, cutting from tip 
to butt. Scald the tomatoes one and 
one-half minutes and cold-dip. Re- 
move the skin and core. Chop toma- 
toes into medium-sized pieces. Mix 
thoroughly two parts of tomatoes 
with one part of corn. Pack the mix- 
ture in hot glass jars. Add a level 
teaspoon of salt per quart. Put 
rubbers and caps of jars in position, 
not tight. Sterilize for the length of 
time given below for the particular 
type of outfit used:

Corn, Tomato and String Bean 
Combination — Use one part of corn, 
one part of green string beans and 
three parts of tomatoes. Blanch fresh 
corn on the cob for five minutes and

Peaches 

Aside from its attractive appear- 
ance, the peach is also so wholesome 
and easily digested that it should be 
used freely. A good portion should 
be canned or dried and put away for 
winter use. Peaches keep well no 
matter what method of canning is 
used, and they are not hard to keep, 
either, as are some other fruits. One 
must be sure that they are thor- 
oughly cooked when the open-kettle 
method is used. Although the peach 
is a rather sweet-tasting fruit, it 
does not have as much sugar as 
some other fruits, but it does not re- 
quire any more sugar on that ac- 
count, as the lack of sue-ar is not 
perceptible, even after cooking. In- 
deed, it is a fruit that loses some of 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



For Clippings 



THEaPHILADELPHIA RECORD— /lZu;a>'s Reliable 

205 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

its fine flavor when made too sweet. 
For that reason it is a good plan to 
use a little cornstarch instead of so 
much sugar to get the thick syrup 
that is so delicious in our stewed or 
canned peaches. Some persons like 
the proportion of a level teaspoon of 
cornstarch to a pint of cold water 
and then adding sugar to taste. The 
cornstarch is dissolved in the cold 
water before the sugar is added, and 
it is then allowed to come to the boil- 
ing point before the fruit is added. 
Peaches cooked in this way do not 
have any cornstarch flavor. To make 
a syrup enough to can a peck of 
peaches without using the cornstarch, 
take one quart of sugar to three 
quarts of water. If cornstarch is 
added less sugar is required, of 
course, but how much less depends 
upon the sweet tooth of the family! 
Peaches may be peeled easily by 
plunging into boiling water for three 
or four minutes and then into cold 
water. The skin may be pulled off 
then. 



Rhubarb Easy to Can 

If you never have tried canning 
rhubarb without heating it do not let 
the season go by before you make the 
experiment. It is easy to do, not ex- 
pensive and is most satisfactorj' in 
results. 

Have your jars ready before you 
wish to use them. See that they are 
clean and that the jars, covers and 
rubbers are sterile, i. e., that they 
have been boiled, and then set aside 
in the water in which they have been 
boiled. . Wash the rhubarb well and 
cut off any bad parts. Do not pare 
if it is at all tender. Cut in one-inch 
pieces, or about that size, and pack 
each jar as full and tight as possible. 
Then hold it under the cold water 
faucet until every bit of air has been

expelled and the water is running 
over the top of the jar. Keep as full 
of water as possible, put on the rub- 
ber, cover and tighten. It is ready- 
to set away for winter use, and will 
be found to taste just as good as the 
fresh rhubarb. 

Directions for Drying 

With the present national need to 
conserve all food, and with a shortage 
of tin glaring us in the face, house- 
wives are turning to the drying 
method again. There is another rea- 
son why drying appeals. The dried 
products may be stored in less space 
and are lighter to handle. Water or 
moisture makes the great bulk of our 
foods and when this has been ex- 
tracted the foods shrink greatly. 
Moisture is necessary for the growth 
of bacteria, and bacteria cause our 
food to spoil, so that is why dried 
goods will keep, provided, of course, 
that they are well dried when stored. 
The nutritive value of food does not 
change much when it is dried, but the 
color does, and there usually is a dif- 
ference in flavor. 

Moisture may be evaporated by ex- 
posing food materials to the direct 
rays of the sun, to oven heat, to cur- 
rents of heated air, or by using a 
partial vacuum for rapid drying at a 
low temperature. 

Drying by exposure to the sun's 
rays and by the heat of the oven are 
the two ways commonly used by the 
homemaker. In all oven drying the 
heat should be regulated so that a 
constant low temperature is main- 
tained. The foods must dry slowly 
and not be allowed to cook or scorch.. 

Not all fruits and vegetables lend 
themselves to this method of preser- 
vation. Of the fruits, cherries, cur- 
rants, huckleberries, peaches and ap- 
ples are the best for drying. Berries 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable

may be dried, but they are seedy and 
not particularly desirable. Pears and 
quinces may also be dried. Quinces, 
however, are usually quite expensive 
and the few that might be obtained 
are better to be used for jellies and 
preserves, though it might be well to 
have a small supply of dried quinces 
to combine with dried apples for the 
sake of their flavor. 

Of the vegetables, green shell peas, 
green shell beans (any of the bush 
and pole bean varieties such as are 
used for green shell beans), string 
beans, green shell lima beans, corn 
and pumpkin are the best to dry. 

Directions for Drying 
Berries or Soft Fruit 

Stem, wash, wipe off excess mois- 
ture with soft cheesecloth or other 
clean absorbent fabric. Spread one 
layer thick upon pans or trays, and 
expose to rays of sun or to oven heat. 
The oven heat should be kept at a 
low, even temperature. Have the 
oven just warm enough so that the 
fruit will dry slowly and not be 
cooked. As the fruit dries, stir and 
heap up occasionally, and then 
respread. 

It is not difficult to dry either vege- 
tables or fruits, yet they can be dried 
most successfully by cutting them 
into thin slices and then proceeding 
as above. One can get directions from 
a Government bulletin showing how 
to make driers that may be attached 
to the kitchen range. One woman 
manages very successfully using a 
home-made drier, which is nothing 
but trays constructed from laths or 
thin strips of wood. These are slipped 
into a little frame, also home-made, 
which holds them about two inches 
apart, the whole drier is suspended 
from a hook in the ceiling of her back 
porch. She covers the entire drier

with mosquito netting to keep away 
the flies and in this way she has been 
successful in securing a goodly store 
of dried fruits and vegetables for 
winter use. 

The vegetables should be selected 
when they are ready to use for the 
table ; that is, for instance, green peas 
and beans just right for cooking are 
right for drying. They should be 
dipped in boiling water for about a 
minute and then in cold water to chill 
them, then should be dried and put on 
the pans or trays; the beans, of 
course, should be cut in thin slices 
and the string beans are really better 
if they are steamed for 15 or 20 min- 
utes before they are dried. The best 
plan is to send for the Government 
pamphlet. Farmers' Bulletin No. 841, 
on drying fruit. State College gets 
out an excellent one. It is Extension 
Bulletin No. 61. A postal card sent 
to State College will bring it to you.

FIRST AIDS IN 
THE KITCHEN 

Preparedness is the keynote of the 
times. It is taking the place of that 
much overworked word "efficiency." 
Yet one cannot have preparedness un- 
less it is based upon a foundation of 
efficiency. The efficient housewife will 
look ahead and see if she has the 
things at hand to meet each occasion 
as it arises. To have remedies within 
reach which can be applied imme- 
diately when accidents occur is one 
of the first requisites of preparedness. 

We all know the old saying which 
begins 'Tor want of a nail a shoe was 
lost, for want of a shoe a horse was 
lost," etc., until a nation was lost. 
Sometimes in everyday life that for 
the want of a remedy a life is lost, or 
at least, a life is maimed by loss of a 
hand, finger or foot. For that reason 
there should be a cabinet or a comer 
in the cupboard where certain things 
are kept on hand ready to be applied 
when needed. 

The housewife who has tne follow- 
ing list in her home can treat effi- 
ciently almost any injury, wound, 
shock or common illness which arises 
suddenly. The most necessary articles 
are: aromatic spirits of ammonia, 
mustard, talcum powder, boric acid, 
carbolated vaseline, plain vaseline, 
olive oil, listerine, witch hazel, oil of 
cloves, menthol crystals, phenol- 
sodique, a bottle of ipecac, a small 
package of gauze, sealed ; a package of 
absorbent cotton, sealed; a package 
of gauze bandage, sealed; a box of 
adhesive plaster, 1-inch wide; a bot- 
tle of blue corrosive sublimate tab- 
lets, a box of charcoal tablets, a box 
of rochelle salts or other purgative, 
eye glass, ice cap, hot-water bottle. 
With these things at hand one may 
cope with almost any situation. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

It must be remembered that the 
package of glazed gauze must be kept 
sealed until used, and then, when 
used, what is left must be fastened 
. ( securely in wax paper and sealed 
again by means of adhesive tape, 
gummed paper, or some other good 
way of securing the package. That is, 
the package must not be left broken 
and in a condition to be handled by 
members of the family. The corro- 
sive sublimate is deadly poison and 
should be kept out of the way of chil- 
dren or anyone who would mistake 
the tablets for something else. For 
that reason the blue corrosive tablets 
are to be preferred for use in the 
home because when a tablet has been 
dissolved in water, the blue color will 
warn everyone that it is not drinking 
water. 

A word about keeping poison out 
of the reach of children will not be 
amiss here. Whenever poison has to 
be kept in the house it should be kept 
out of reach, up high somewhere, or 
under lock and key if possible. In 
addition, every bottle containing 
poison should have something to 
mark it. A tiny bell tied around the 
neck of the bottle on a ribbon is a 
good way, or a bit of rough substance 
pasted on the neck of the bottle also 
is good, so that anyone talking up the 
bottle in the dark will know that it is 
not an ordinary bottle. 

Emergency Remedies for Some 

of the Accidents and Common 

Ailments Which Occur in the 

Home 

Naturally the most common acci- 
dent which occurs in the kitchen is 
a burn, either from fire or water. Wa- 
ter causes scalds and fire burns. 
Either may be shallow; that is, just 
skin deep or they may be deep down 
to the bone. With burns we have

shock, which is often severe. Very 
deep burns and scalds require the at- 
tention of a physician immediately, 
though, of course, one may do some- 
thing to alleviate the suffering at 
once. The best thing to do is to soak 
them with olive oil or to apply cor- 
bolated vaseline, lard or any such 
grease, cover with absorbent cotton 
or soft linen and bind up until the 
physician comes. Meantime, as a 
remedy for the shock which occurs, 
one teaspoonf ul of spirits of ammonia 
in a half glass of water may be given. 
For children give one-half this dose. 

Where the pains or scalds are 
slight, only skin deep, they may be 
treated by home remedies. The great 
thing, of course, is to keep the air 
from the injury. This may be done 
by applying soda and water, dusting 
with cornstarch or flour where the 
skin is not broken — anything that will 
keep out the air, as, for instance, one 
woman burned herself slightly and 
checked the burn by putting on a 
thick coating of marmalade which 
was the nearest thing she had at 
hand. For deeper burns, which still 
are not severe, put on the vaseline or 
lard or some such grease and bind up 
as for a deep burn. Sometimes the 
burn is caused by an acid which will 
irritate a delicate skin. This should 
be washed with water as quickly as 
possible, and then soda or soap suds 
applied to counteract the acid, and if 
the burn comes from alkalis, such as 
ammonia, potash, lye or caustic or 
soda, apply vinegar or lemon juice to 
neutralize the burn and then put on 
olive oil or vaseline and bind up. 

Wounds also are common in the 
kitchen, though usually they are 
slight in character, yet even a slight 
wound if not properly cared for may 
become infected and cause blood poi- 
soning. For that reason the very best 
first aid is to look out that you do not

T HE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

break the skin by tacks, broken glass 
in opening cans or bottles and in using 
knives or scissors. The old adage, 
"Always cut from you and you will 
never cut yourself," is a very good 
one to follow. But when the injury is 
done and the skin has been cut or 
torn, care must be taken that pus 
germs do not have a chance to enter 
through the broken skin. If the wound 
is large enough to cut an artery, 
which will show by the blood spurting 
out bright red, this must be checked 
by tying a cloth tight above the 
wound. If a vein has been cut and 
the dark blood flows out steadily, then 
tie a cloth or handkerchief tightly 
below the wound and then apply the 
remedy. 

Cold water will stop the flow of 
blood, but cold water sometimes has 
germs in it, and so some further pre- 
caution must be taken, also precau- 
tion must be taken that pus germs 
which are carried on the clothing and 
on the hands do not have an oppor- 
tunity to enter through the wound, or 
if they do enter only in such small 
quantities that they can be overcome 
by the system. For that reason some 
kind of an antiseptic must be used. 
If the wound is very slight one may 
simply apply wet salt, as salt in itself 
is an antiseptic. Of course, for a 
wound that is painful it is better to 
apply either a little listerine or a so- 
lution of boric acid. For a somewhat 
serious cut it is wiser to take the pre- 
caution of using half a corrosive sub- 
limate tablet in a pint of water and 
immerse the cut or injured member in 
this water, or apply the water to the 
wound with absorbent cotton. The 
wound may then be dressed with a 
bandage of sterilized gauze, fastened 
on by tiny strips of adhesive plaster 
and then a bandage placed over this. 
Boric acid is a very good antiseptic 
to have on hand in a saturated solu- 
tion. A small bottle of this may be 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

217 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

bought at the drug store for very 
little money and is excellent to apply 
to minor cuts and injuries; moreover, 
it is excellent to use upon the eyes if 
anything gets in them. A tablespoon- 
ful of the saturated solution of boric 
acid in a glass of cooled, boiled water 
makes an excellent eye wash and is 
easily applied when one has an eye 
glass in the house. Such a glass costs 
fifteen cents and with care will last 
for years. Where no such glass is 
at hand, one may make a cup of the 
palm of the hand and put the boric 
water in that and open the eye in it. 

In falls or bruises the swelling and 
pain may be relieved by applications 
of cold water in the summer time and 
by applications of water and alcohol 
in winter. Where the bruise is slight 
no further treatment is necessary. If 
the swelling continues it is best to put 
ice in a cloth or bag and keep it on 
the bruise. The same treatment ap- 
plies to sprains, except that if the 
sprain is severe the physician should 
be summoned at once, and in the 
meantime the injured member should 
have as much rest as possible and 
should be raised somewhat so that it 
will get less blood. 

If it is a strain instead of a sprain 
it is well to rub the injury, but, of 
course, one cannot be sure whether it 
is a sprain or strain until a physi- 
cian has seen the injury. 

Nose bleeding often is an annoying 
thing and comes at times when it is 
almost impossible to give it proper 
treatment. The first thing is to use 
a small block of cotton. When it is 
possible, cold water should be applied 
to the back of the neck, to the wrists 
or to the forehead just over the nose. 
This will usually stop even an obsti- 
nate nose bleeding. 

Hiccoughing also is often trouble- 
some. The first remedy for this is to 
draw a deep breath and hold it as 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



long as possible. If this does not stop 
the hiccoughs, one may apply a mus- 
tard plaster to the pit of the stomach 
or place cloths wrung from hot vine- 
gar upon the stomach. 

Whenever poison has been swal- 
lowed the first thing to do is to give 
an emetic to make the person vomit. 
Lukewarm water will often do this, 
or a teaspoonf ul of mustard in a glass 
of water and swallowed will cause 
vomiting, and a very simple and old- 
fashioned way is simply to poke the 
finger down the throat. A tablespoon- 
f ul of ipecac in a half a glass of water 
will also produce vomiting. After the 
patient has vomited freely, keep on 
giving plenty of lukewarm water so 
that the stomach will be washed out 
and bring with it as much of the poi- 
son as possible. In speaking of vom- 
iting it is well to remember that some- 
times in cases of ptomaine poisoning 
the vomiting keeps up with severe 
cramps to a point where it should be 
stopped, and a simple remedy for this 
is to put a mustard plaster on the 
pit of the stomach. This often will 
relieve the excessive vomiting or 
retching. 

Sometimes we have heat exhaustion 
in a hot, close kitchen, or what prac- 
tically amounts to sunstroke. In the 
first place, where it is heat exhaus- 
tion it should be treated like fainting. 
The person should be removed to a 
cool place, the clothing removed, 
fresh air given and a little cold water 
sprinkled on the face. When it ap- 
proaches sunstroke and the skin is 
hot and dry, the person should be 
given a cold bath and applications of 
cold water by means of cloths should 
be kept up. The patient might be 
wrapped in a wet sheet. At the same 
time the body should be rubbed to in- 
crease the circulation and bring the 
blood to the surface of the body.

In a case of convulsions the cloth- 
ing should be removed and then at- 
tention should be paid to the tongue 
w^hich is often bitten in a case of this 
kind. A wedge of a brush handle 
or something similar should be used 
to pry open the jaws and then a 
twisted napkin or towel may be in- 
serted. When that is done the patient 
must be put in hot water, or applica- 
tions of heat made by cloths wrung 
out of hot water may be given. A 
baby, for instance, may be placed in 
a tub of hot water into which a table- 
spoonful of mustard has been dis- 
solved. Convulsions in children are 
sometimes due to indigestion and, 
therefore, it is always best to make 
children vomit. 

This same rule applies to croup, 
which is something which terrorizes 
nearly all parents, yet in most cases 
croup is not dangerous if taken at 
once, that is why a bottle of ipecac 
is necessary to have at hand, because 
this will cause a child to vomit. A 
tablespoonful of ipecac followed by a 
glass of warm water is the very best 
thing to cause vomiting in croup. The 
terrible strangling, together with the 
hoarseness may be relieved by putting 
a few crystalfS of menthols in boiling 
water' and letting the child inhale 
this steam at once. Where the attack 
is stubborn, the water may be kept 
hot over a lamp or alcohol stove and 
thus relieve the awful cough and cry. 

Stings of insects may be relieved by 
simple remedies such as soda or am- 
monia for mosquito bites. Bee and 
spider stings may be alleviated by ap- 
plying diluted ammonia, wet salt, 
baking soda or even mud when noth- 
ing else is at hand. 

Removal of Stains 

Stains may be removed more easily 
when fresh. Knowledge of some of 
the simpler agents used in removing 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— i4/u;a>'s Reliable 

220 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

different kinds of stains from gar- 
ments or cloth not only saves money, 
but also time, both of which are neces- 
sary to have the garments commer- 
cially cleaned or remodeled. To make 
the best use of this knowledge one 
also should have the tools to work 
with at hand. Water and soap are, of 
course, the first things to use in re- 
moving most stains from washable 
fabrics. Unwashable fabrics must be 
treated differently ; for that reason it 
is necessary to have certain common 
chemicals in the house. 

Some of these are Javelie water, 
oxalic acid, ammonia, acetic acid, 
French chalk or Fuller's earth and 
cream of tartar. In addition one also 
may draw upon the common house- 
hold stock of lemons, vinegar and 
soda. One may make a considerable 
portion of Javelie water and have it at 
hand. It may be prepared as follows : 

Javelie Water 

Dissolve 1 pound of washing soda 
in 1 quart of cold water. To this 
solution add l^ pound of ordinary 
bleaching powder (calcium hypo- 
chlorite). Filter this liquid through 
a piece of muslin to remove the sedi- 
ment which remains. Keep the clear 
liquid in tightly stopped bottles for 
use. Javelie water may be used suc- 
cessfully in removing a number of 
stains, but should be applied only to 
uncolored cotton or linen materials, 
since it bleaches colors and rots silks 
or wool. In treating stains with 
Javelie water, stretch the stained por- 
tion over a bowl of water and apply 
the Javelie water to the stain with a 
medicine dropper. Do not allow the 
Javelie water to remain in contact 
with the stain for more than one min- 
ute and then apply oxalic acid solution 
to neutralize the Javelie water, and 
rinse by dipping the stain in the bowl 
of water.

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

It is a wise plan, in a large family 
where many stains are to be removed, 
to have certain utensils in the laundry 
which will make this work much 
easier. These are a medium-sized 
earthen bowl, medicine dropper, glass 
rod with rounded ends, several pads 
of cheesecloth or old muslin and a 
small sponge. 

When stains are to be removed 
from unwashable garments it is wise 
to try the effect of the chemicals on 
a piece of cloth before attempting to 
remove the stain from the garment. 
Where this is not possible place a pad 
of cloth under the stain, then dip the 
rounded end of the glass rod in the 
chemical and touch the stain lightly 
with this to see what the effect will 
be. The pad will absorb the extra 
moisture and keep it from spreading 
on the garment. In this way one may 
see what effect the stain removers 
have upon the stain without spoiling 
the garment. 

Some of the common household 
stains which must be removed almost 
weekly are : 

Stains from Fruits and Berries 

As a usual thing fruit stains may 
be removed from white goods by 
pouring boiling water over the stains 
before the cloth has been wet. The 
stained part should be stretched over 
the bowl tightly and the boiling water 
allowed to fall on the stain from a 
height of two or three feet. Hold up 
the kettle and let the water pour 
down on the stain. This usually will 
make the stain disappear like magic. 
If it does not disappear entirely, rub 
lemon juice on the stain and place in 
the sunlight. It is not best to use" 
soap on fruit stains. Where the gar- 
ment cannot be washed, as, for in- 
stance, silk and wool, the stained part 
should be placed over a pad and 
sponged with warm water on the 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

wrong side. This will let any par- 
ticles of fruit pulp wash out on the 
pad instead of being rubbed into the 
cloth. The pad will also absorb the 
extra moisture and keep it from 
spreading. 

Coffee Stains 

Coffee stains usually may be re- 
moved like fruit stains, sometimes 
merely washing them in soap and 
water will take them out. If the stain 
does not entirely disappear it should 
be placed in the sunlight. When these 
simple remedies do not remove the 
coffee stain, a little diluted Javelle 
water should be applied, allow to 
stand for a few minutes and wash 
out. Over-bluing may be treated in 
the same way. 

Grease Spots 

Grease spots are usually removed 
from washable fabrics by the use of 
a good naphtha soap or kerosene. The 
grease spots should be wet and then 
rubbed thoroughly before the gar- 
ment is placed in the water. Grease 
spots on colored linens are somewhat 
difficult to remove, but if they are 
carefully soaped before being placed 
in the water they will usually come 
out all right. It is a good plan to 
scrape off every particle of grease 
before the stain is to be removed. 

For non-washable goods dry ab- 
sorbent materials may be applied, for 
instance, blotting paper, French 
chalk, powdered magnesia or white 
talcum powder for fine materials and 
for heavier things, as for carpets, 
rugs or coarse materials, corn meal 
or salt may be rubbed in. When the 
blotting paper is used it should be 
placed on both sides of the stain and a 
warm, but not hot, iron applied; as 
the paper removes the grease fresh 
paper should be applied. When we 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

m 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

use the dry powders, the stained fab- 
ric should be placed upon a flat sur- 
face and a layer of the powder placed 
over the stain. As soon as it becomes 
a little gummy the garment should be 
brushed or shaken and a fresh layer 
put on. Sometimes grease spots may 
be removed by chloroform, ether, 
gasoline, naphtha and benzine. It 
m.ust be remembered that these are 
very inflammable and should never be 
used in a room where there is any 
exposed light or flame. The chloro- 
form and ether are best to use on deli- 
cate fabrics, because they leave almost 
no ring or trace. When gasoline or 
benzine are used it is better to have 
enough fluid to cover the whole gar- 
ment if possible. One may, in fact, 
do "very good dry cleaning" at home 
with gasoline by buying enough to 
cover the garment thoroughly and 
putting it in a covered receptacle and 
allowing it to remain over night, but 
gasoline should never be used in any 
place where there is fire, as it is most 
inflammable. 

Iron Rust 

Iron rust is a very common stain 
and often comes from using a rusty 
wringer or boiler in the laundry, but 
sometimes it comes from using the 
liquid blue of the Prussian blue type. 
When this Prussian blue is used one 
must be very careful to thoroughly 
rinse all soap or alkalis from the gar- 
ments before placing them into the 
bluing water, otherwise a chemical 
action will take place which will re- 
lease the iron in the bluing and specks 
of iron rust will come out of the cloth. 
As a usual thing, iron rust is removed 
from white clothing by rubbing the 
stain with lemon juice and salt and 
holding it over the spout of a tea- 
kettle filled with boiling water, or one 
may rub on the lemon and salt and 
place the stain in the sunshine. On 
colored material one should try the

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

effect of the chemical iirst on samples 
or on an inconspicuous place. Oxalic 
acid in a saturated solution of about 

. one teaspoonful of oxalic acid to ten 
teaspoonf uls of water, may be used by 
stretching the stained place over a 

• bowl of hot water and applying the 
acid drop by drop, until the stain 
turns bright yellow, then immerse in 
hot water until stain disappears, re- 
move, if necessary, at the last with a 
little ammonia or borax in the rinsing 
water to neutralize the acid which 
may remain in the goods. 

Ink Stains 

Ink stain is often difficult to remove, 
as ink varies so greatly in composi- 
tion. Neither cold water nor milk 
will set a stain, so these are always 
safe to use to remove a greater part 
of the ink. If the ink is spilled on an 
article that can be put in a basin of 
water, do this at once, then rinse until 
no more ink comes out. If the ink is 
spilled on the floor or carpet, cover 
the spot with some absorbent, such as 
cornmeal or starch; remove, continue 
to do this until no more ink is ab- 
sorbed. Then apply cut end of 
lemon, trimming off end as it becomes 
soiled. Rinse with cold water. Or 
one may wet stain with cold water 
and then apply 10 per cent, solution 
of oxalic acid. Let stand a few min- 
utes and rinse in water to which a 
little ammonia has been added. Re- 
peat until stain disappears. One also 
may wet stained part with a paste 
made of lemon juice, salt, starch and 
soap, and then expose it to the sun- 
light. Alcohol will remove some ink 
stains. 

Grass Stains 

Grass stains as a usual thing may 
be removed by soaking in alcohol and 
then washing with naphtha soap. 
Colored fabrics may be rubbed with 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— y4/u;a>'s Reliable 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 



molasses, or if they are non-fading, 
a paste of soap may be placed over 
the grass stain and then the garment 
laundered as usual. 



Iodine 

Iodine has a different effect upon 
starched and non-starched materials. 
From unstarched materials the iodine 
can be removed by simply soaking in 
cold w^ater for a number of hours, or 
by sponging with diluted ammonia. 
Alcohol also may be used to sponge 
the stain. Sometimes a paste of 
starch put over the iodine and left for 
several hours will remove it entirely. 
If the stain is on starched material 
the stain should be soaked in diluted 
ammonia until it disappears, then 
rinse and wash. Sometimes boiling 
the starched material for five or ten 
rninutes will remove the stain of 
iodine. Iodine also may be removed 
by soaking in alcohol, chloroform or 
ether. 

Mildew 

Mildew may be removed by three 
methods : 

(1) Light and recent stains may 
often be removed by wetting them, 
rubbing with soap, then covering spot 
with wet starch and spread in sun. 
Renew applications frequently. (2) 
Put on lemon juice and expose to 
direct sunlight. (3) Chloride of lime 
and Javelle water are both effective 
agents in removing mildew stains 
from white fabrics. Soak until stain 
disappears and rinse well. 

Lamp Black or Tar 

Saturate spot with kerosene. Wash 
with naphtha soap and water. If 
lamp black is on a carpet rub spot 
with starch, cornmeal, flour, Fuller's 
earth or salt. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD^Always Reliable 

226 



THE PHILADELPHI A RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

Machine Oil 

Two methods of removing machine 
oil are commonly used: 

(1) Wash with cold water and 
soap, rubbing from the outside toward 
the centre of the spot, using care not 
to allow the spot to spread. (2) Wet 
spot with turpentine, benzine or alco- 
hol and let it stand a few minutes. 
Wet again and sponge with a clean 
cloth. Continue until stains disap- 
pear. Chloroform will remove spots 
from delicate fabrics, such as light 
silks. 

Blood Stains 

Fresh blood stains may be removed 
by soaking in cold water for several 
hours, then rub with a good naphtha 
soap and launder in the usual way. 
Old stains may be a little harder to 
remove and if they do not yield to 
that process, then use two tablespoon- 
f uls of ammonia to one-half gallon of 
water and soak the garments in this. 
Javelle water may be used as a last 
resort. All woolen materials or thick 
materials, such as flannel and blank- 
ets, may have a paste of raw starch 
applied and allowed to dry, then 
brush away. For wool or silk a little 
hydrogen peroxide often will remove 
the traces of blood, but should be 
tried first to see if it will remove the 
color from the fabric. If the blood 
stain is perfectly fresh, sponge with 
warm water, which will remove the 
blood stain. 

Candle Wax 

Candle wax stains may be removed 
by sponging with alcohol. 

By experimenting and removing 
the common stains one will gain a 
knowledge of chemicals and absorb- 
ents that will make it possible to take 
care of almost any stain that comes 
along.

CARE OF CHILDREN 

The three great essentials that 
every baby must have for its best de- 
velopment are pure air, pure water 
and pure food. The most important 
of these is pure food so far as the 
mother is concerned. P'or this lies 
most directly in her hands. The 
city undertakes to furnish pure water 
(and pure air after a fashion) , but the 
babe depends directly upon its mother 
for nourishment. 

The Perfect Food 

Nature gives to mothers a perfect 
food. The mother who does not nurse 
her babe when it is possible not only 
performs an unloving act, but she is 
cheating her baby of its best food. She 
is taking away a protection that may 
cost her child its life. For every 
breast-fed baby that dies seven bottle- 
fed babies die. So it is taking pretty 
long chances if you want your baby 
to live. Breast-fed babies have a bet- 
ter chance to fight off "summer com- 
plaint," convulsions and tuberculosis. 
Then there is nothing which will re- 
place breast milk in helping to de- 
velop the child normally so that he will 
have perfect health in later life. We 
are told that grown people would 
escape many of the defects and 
deficiencies with which they have to 
contend if they had passed the period 
of infancy in perfect health. 

To Wean 

A baby usually should be weaned 
by the time it is a year old, and 
the best and easiest way to do this is 
to accustom the baby to the use of a 
nursing bottle by giving it boiled 
water to drink from the bottle a few 
days after it is born. In this way the 
babe becomes accustomed to the bot- 
tle, so that when it is about 10 months 

THE PHILADELPHIA YLECOKH— Always Reliable 

228 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

old one feeding of milk a day may be 
given. In a week or two a second 
feeding each day may be given, and so 
on until the weaning is complete. But 
no mother should think of weaning 
her child in the heat of summer or 
w^hen children's diseases are preva- 
lent. It has been proven over and 
over again that breast milk will save 
a baby's life and restore him to health 
after the strain of a long, hot sum- 
mer. It is difficult to find any other 
food that can be relied upon to accom- 
plish this result. 

When artificial food must be re- 
sorted to, cow's milk, diluted and 
modified to suit the child's age and de- 
velopment, will be found the best. 
There are, of course, a few excep- 
tions, but no mother should experi- 
ment with different foods or mix- 
tures, neither should she rely upon the 
advice of her neighbors. She should 
consult her doctor. 

Care should be taken to get the 
milk from a reputable dealer who will 
give you pasteurized milk in bottles, 
capped in the factory and not filled on 
the milk wagon to be capped by the 
hands of the drivers who have been 
using the same hands to hold the lines, 
pick up dirty milk bottles and slap 
the horse on the back. 

Absolute cleanliness must be ob- 
served in preparing and taking care 
of the baby's food. Dirt is often the 
advance agent of death for bottle-fed 
babies. The hands must be kept 
clean, as well as the bottles, nipples, 
dishes, pans and everything else 
that comes in contact with the 
baby's food. An excellent plan is to 
have separate pans and dishes and 
keep them for the baby's food, never 
using them for anything else. The 
expense need not be great. A granite 
pan may be had for 10 to 15 cents. 

THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— >4/u;a>'s Reliable 

229 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

A graduated measuring glass may be 
bought at any drug store for a small 
sum. 

If the nipples and bottles are rinsed 
in cold water as soon as they are used 
they can be kept sweet and clean 
much easier. The bottle should be 
kept in a pan of cold water and 
should be boiled before it is needed 
again. The nipple should be washed 
inside and out with soap and hot 
water, rinsed in cold water and then 
put in a jar containing boric acid so- 
lution. To make the latter, use one 
teaspoonful of boric acid to one cup 
of boiling water. A pinch of bak- 
ing soda in a glass of water will keep 
them sweet. 

In preparing and modifying cows' 
milk or artificial food of any kind the 
mother should follow directions given 
by her doctor or by the physicians at 
the Health Centres. 

The following directions for feeding 
the baby, prepared by a committee of 
the American Medical Association and 
published by the Children's Bureau at 
Washington should be of interest to 
all mothers who are unfortunate 
enough not to be able to nurse their 
children. The bulletin, "Infant 
Care," may be had by writing to the 
United States Department of Labor, 
Children's Bureau. It is sent free. 

Unless a child has loose bowels he 
should be given from one to three 
tablespoonfuls of strained fruit juice 
once a day after he is seven or eight 
months old. After he is nine months 
old he may be given squeezed beef 
juice, beef tea or plain mutton or 
chicken broth once a day. 

When he is 10 months old he may 
have part of a soft-boiled egg, a small 
piece of crisp toast or zwieback, or a 
crust of bread to chew immediatelv 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD— Always Reliable 

230 



THE PHILADELPHIA RECORD WAR COOK BOOK 

after his feeding. Other solid foods 
should not be given during the first 
year. 

Begin with a very small quantity 
of each new food, noting carefully the 
effect on the baby and strengthening 
it slowly as required. For instance, 
begin by giving the fruit juice diluted 
with an equal quantity of water, and 
increase gradually until the proper 
amount for the given age is reached. 

Beef juice is chiefly valuable as a 
stimulant. It has but little food value 
and is not to be given in the place of 
nourishing foods, but as an addition 
to it. Two teaspoonfuls diluted with 
an equal quantity of water may be 
given 15 minutes before the midday 
meal. 

Bills of Fare 

The following bills of fare are sug- 
gested for older infants, i. e., from 
12 to 24 months old: 

From twelfth to eighteenth month : 

First meal — on rising. 

I. Two to four tablespoonf uls of the 
juice of a sweet orange or pulp of six 
stewed prunes, or one tablespoonful 
pineapple juice. 

II. One cupful of milk with either 
zweiback or toasted biscuits or stale

It will be seen that care and not 
cost must be emphasized. The foods 
that little children eat are not high- 
priced. The mother who will take the 
trouble to prepare these foods and 
give them at regular hours, even at 
the cost of some sacrifice on her own 
part, will be amply repaid by the joy 
and comfort that come from having a 
happy, healthy babe. 

Pure Water 

Water is most important to healthy 
child development. It is a body regu- 
lator, it keeps the food properly 
diluted, gives moisture to the various 
membranes and prevents friction. We 
cannot get along without water. Pro- 
fessional fasters have proved that, 
given plenty of water, they can live 
for weeks without food. No one can 
live many days without water. 

Little babies should be fed water 
as carefully as food. Breast-fed 
babies are no exception. Many a baby 
frets and cries because it is thirsty 
and has no other way to make grown- 
ups understand. And sometimes they 
are so stupid that they do not think 
of water at all.

Two Important Don*ts for 
Young Mothers 

Don't give baby cakes, candy, 
doughnuts, pastry, fresh breads, grid- 
dlecakes, syrups or molasses, pork or 
tough meat of any kind, bananas, or 
any overripe fruit, pickles, tea, coffee, 
soda water, wine, cider, beer, nor 
tastes of the family meals. If this 
is begun he will soon demand a taste 
of everything he sees, and his appe- 
tite for the simple diet, which is 
essential at this age, will be quickly 
destroyed. 

Don't coax baby to take more food 
than he wants. Too much food and 
too frequent feedings overtax the di- 
gestion and lead to stomach and 
intestinal disturbances.
