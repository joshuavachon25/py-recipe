The 



Spaulding 

Chafing Dish 

Book 



Spaulding & Company 

Goldsmiths Silversmiths 
and Jewelers 

Chicago Paris 



'HT^HE previous publications on the chafing dish issued 
by Spaulding & Company have met with such 
universal favor that it has seemed wise to publish a 
third book. This is probably the most complete com- 
pilation of simple recipes ever printed. The aim has 
been to embody in these recipes only such ingredients as 
will be found in the average well-regulated household; 
in fact many of the recipes mentioned herein are sim- 
plicity itself, so far as their demand on the larder is 
concerned. 

The demand for the chafing dish has grown to 
very large proportions, and with good reason, for its 
convenience and the palatableness of the dishes produced 
— everything hot, and right from the fire to the plate — 
the opportunity for showing one' s grace and ability in 
cooking and serving, the possibility of little experiments 
and changes in conditions and proportions, the personality 
and interest, attaching to the actual culinary operations, 
all these combine to make the chafing dish a favorite 
utensil in every family. 




Much time will be saved and confusion prevented by 
filling the lamp before the chafing dish is placed before the 
■ host or hostess, and by having all necessary materials on 
the table before being seated. 

Heat the milk, stock or water if possible, before using 
in the chafing dish. 

Never allow the prepared dishes to boil after eggs are 
added. 

In the recipes given, the seasoning should be measured 
level. 

The butter and flour should be measured rounded like 
the bowl of a spoon. 

The cup used for measuring should hold one-half pint. 

The butter may be made into balls, one or two balls 
representing a rounded tablespoonfial; these can be arranged 
on an attractive dish at the right. 

The cream, stock or gravy used, should be measured 
and put in a small pitcher at the left. Catsups, wine and 
large materials should also be arranged as daintily as possi- 
ble at the left. 

The heat from different lamps in chafing dishes varies 
somewhat and judgment must be used as to the time given 
in these recipes. 

When using the chafing dish to saute or fry do not 
use the hot water dish, and in all other cases do not use it 
unless there is danger of burning the ingredients. The hot 
water dish may be used with water to keep all dishes hot 
after they are prepared.
