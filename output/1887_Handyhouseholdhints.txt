Soup. 

Bouillon. — Take from four to 
eight pounds of beef from the shoul- 
der, — according to the number to be 
served, — put on early in the morning 
for six o'clock dinner, in water enough 
to cover it, with two quarts additional ; 
let it boil slowly until the beef is ten- 
der; remove from the fire. When 
cold skim off the fat, add salt and 
pepper to taste, strain into a soup 
kettle, and boil for half an hour, add 
a root of celery, or pieces cut an inch 
long. 

Soup Coloring. — A gill of water, 
a quarter of a pound of lump sugar, 
and half an ounce of butter should be 
put on the fire in a small stew-pan, 
and stirred until it is a bright brown 
color ; add to it half a pint of water, 
boil and skim it; let it cool, them 
bottle for future use. 

Pea Soup. — Boil one pint of split 
peas in three quarts of water till quite 
soft. Then stew in the soup a pound 
and one-half of beef and a slice of 
bacon, with a handful of spinach, a 
few cloves, and a little mace. Let it 
stew for two hours, rub it through a 
sieve, then stew it with a little mint 
and spinach cut fine, add salt and 
pepper to taste and a lump of sugar. 
Serve with fried bread cut into dice, 
on a separate dish. 

Chicken Soup. — Boil the bones 
of two chickens with half an onion ; 
the next day skim off all the fat, and 
add half a cupful of pearl barley, 
which has been soaked over night in 
cold water, salt and pepper to taste. 
Just before serving sift in one-third of 
a teacupful of dry, line bread-crumbs. 

Ox-Tail Soup. — Take an ox-tail 
and divide it into small ]>ieces ; wash 
nicely and put into a soup-pot, with 
five qiferts of water and two pounds 
of beef from the shoulder. Boil slow- 



ly for several hours; when the meat 
is sufficiently done to fall from the 
bone, strain ; let it stand over night, 
skim off the fat, return to the kettle, 
and boil two hours. Add one onion, 
celery, and two tablespoonfuls of 
brown flour. This will make about 
three quarts of liquor. Salt and pep- 
per to taste. The flavor will be much 
improved by the addition of a glass 
of wine. 

It is impossible to have good soup 
without a sufficiency of good meat, 
thoroughly boiled, carefully skimmed, 
and moderately seasoned. Meat that 
is too bad for any thing else is too 
bad for soup. Cold meat re-cooked 
adds little to its flavor or nourishment, 
it is in vain to attempt to give poor 
soup a factitious flavor by the disguise 
of strong spices or other substances, 
which are disagreeable or unpalatable 
to at least one-half of the eaters, and 
frequently unwholesome. Rice and 
barley add to the insipidity of weak 
soups, having no taste of their own. 
Even if the meat is good, too large a 
proportion of water and too small a 
quantity of animal substance will ren- 
der it fiat and vapid. All soups 
should be boiled slowly at first, that 
the essence of the meat may be thor- 
oughly drawn out. The lid of the 
kettle should be kept close, except 
when it is necessary to remove it for 
taking off the scum, which should be 
done frequently and carefully. 

If this is neglected the scum will 
boil back into the soup and spoil it. 
When no more scum arises, and the 
meat is in rags, it is time to put in the 
vegetables, seasoning, etc., and not till 
then ; and if it should have boiled 
away too much, then is the time to add 
a little hot water. 

Fried Bread. — Cut bread into 
small cubes, fry in butter, being care- 
ful to brown nicely on all sides, and 
serve with soups on a separate dish.

Fish. 

Creamed Oysters.— One pint of 
oysters, one pint of cream, one heap- 
ing tablespoonful of flour, one-third 
cupful of cold milk, piece of butter 
size of an egg, small piece of onion, 
and a small piece of mace; salt and 
pepper to taste. Put the cream on to 
boil with the onion and mace in it. 
Mix flour with one-third cupful of 
milk and stir into the boiling cream. 
Season with salt and pepper and cook 
ten minutes. While the cream is 
cooking, let the oysters come to a boil ; 
skim carefully, strain and pour into 
the boiling cream. Be careful and not 
cook the oysters too much. 

Creamed Oysters No. 2.— A little 
more than a pint of oysters, one pint of 
cream, salt and pepper to taste. Let 
the cream come to a boil ; mix one 
teaspoonful of flour with a little cold 
milk and stir into the boiling cream. 
Let the oysters come to a boil in their 
own liquor, and turn the oysters into 
the boiling cream. 

Oysters for Lunch. — Trim the 
beards from as many oysters as may 
be required, wrap each in a very thin 
shaving of fat, streaky bacon (cold 
boiled bacon is the best) ; run them 
one after the other onto a skewer, and 
hold them over a clear fire until the 
bacon is slightly crisp; serve on the 
toast immediatelv. 

Pickled Oysters. — Rinse your 
oysters in their liquor, strain it on 
them through a coarse cloth, and give 
them one boil up, then take them out 
of the liquor to cool. Prepare vinegar 
by boiling it with black pepper, a little 
salt, mace, cloves, and nutmeg, and 
when perfectly cold pour it over the 
oysters, and put away in a stone jar. 

Fried Oysters. — Have in your 
frying-pan some boiling lard. Wash 
some large, fine oysters in cold water, 
taking them out quickly. Roll them 
in corn meal ; drop into the hot lard, 
and fry a light brown. 

Oyster Sauce. — Put into a sauce- 
pan two dozen large oysters and strain 
their liquor on to them. Let them 
simmer but not boil ; then take them 
out, and put in pepper and salt, with 



one teaspoonful of flour rubbed 
smoothly in butter, one teacupful of 
milk, and let it all boil. When re- 
moved from the fire put the oysters 
in and serve hot. 

Escalloped Oysters. — Butter an 
oval dish, put in a layer of oysters, 
and dredge in a little salt, pepper, and 
butter, then a layer of rolled cracker ; 
])our over this a few spoonfuls of milk, 
just enough to moisten the cracker, 
then a layer of oysters with salt, pep- 
per, and butter ; another of cracker, 
with a little more milk, and so on 
until the dish is full ; before putting 
into the oven pour a little more milk 
over the top ; bake about half an hour. 

Escalloped Oysters No. 2. — 
Three pints oysters, eight butter crack- 
ers pounded fine, salt, batter, i)epper, 
mace, nutmeg, and one glass of sherry. 
Butter a pudding dish and put a layer 
of cracker-crumbs into it, then a layer 
of oysters, sprinkled with the season- 
ing above-mentioned, then crackers 
and oysters till the dish is filled. Put 
small pieces of butter on the top. 
Pour a wine-glabsful of sherry in care- 
fully just before putting into the oven 
to bake. 

Escalloped Oysters No. 3. — On 
the bottom of a shallow buttered dish 
strew a layer of cracker-meal, a third 
of an inch thick; wet this with oys- 
ter liquor, strained, to which has been 
added an equal quantity of rich milk ; 
on this place a layer of oysters, just 
touching each other, lightly sprinkled 
with pepper and salt, and lay over 
them very small bits of butter. Then 
spread evenly another layer of cracker- 
meal, thick enough to cover the oys- 
ters, taking care to moisten it thor- 
oughly with the prepared liquor. 
Alternate meal and oysters until the 
dish is filled, remembering to have a 
thick layer of cracker-meal well 
moistened, at the top. Bake half an 
hour. 

Fish Chowder. — Take about four 
pounds of either cod or haddock, skin 
it, wash in cold water, and cut in 
small pieces. Then fry in the kettle 
in which the chowder is to be made a 
quarter of a pound of salt pork until 
it is brown. Pare and slice five pota-

toes and one small onion. Place a 
layer of potato and onion in the ket- 
tle, then a layer of fish, dredge lightly 
with salt, pepper, and flour; continue 
adding alternate layers of potato, fish, 
and seasoning until all is used; then 
add hot water enough to cover ; boil 
gently one-half hour tightly covered; 
add a pint of milk and six crackers, 
split and dipped in cold water, and 
cook ten minutes more. 

Baked Shad. — Take some bread- 
crumbs, chopped parsley, butter, pep- 
der, and salt, and mix them up with 
beaten yolk of egg. Fill the shad 
with this dressing, tie a string around 
it, put in a pan with a little water, 
place some pieces of butter over the 
fish, and bake. Onion can be added 
according to taste. 

Steamed Fish. — Cut off the head 
and tail ; wash the fish, salt and lay it 
on a plate in a steamer, and cook till 
done. Then remove carefully to a 
platter, after having taken off the 
skin. Serve with drawn butter made 
as follows : Two heaping teaspoon- 
fuls of flour, mixed well with a piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Pour on 
enough boiling w^ater to make it the 
consistency of cream. 

Fish Balls. — Boil together for 
about one-half hour, one quart of 
sliced potatoes pared, and one large 
cupful of salt fish. Mash, and add 
two tablespoonfuls of cream or milk, 
with a small piece of butter size of an 
egg, and one egg ; beat together with 
a spoon; then have the fat boiling hot, 
drop a tablespoonful of the mixture 
into the hot fat. Do not use the 
hands to make them into balls, or 
flour. 

meats. 

Broiling. — In broiling two things 
are very essential : a bright, hot bed 
of coals and the entire attention of 
the person performing the operation. 
A poor fire dries the meat, rather than 
cooks. The meat should be frequently 
turned, to avoid burning and to enable 
it to become cooked through without 
doing the outside too much. If the 
look is attempting to broil the meat 



and dish up the remainder of the meal 
at the same time, the broiling will be 
neglected and the meat scorched. By 
following the above directions you will 
ensure a well-cooked meat. 

Roast Meat, — In roasting any 
kind of meat place half a dozen me- 
dium-sized, pared potatoes around the 
roast on the grate in the pan, and 
when basting the meat baste the pota- 
toes also. When done they will be a 
rich brown color and are of superb 
flavor. 

Roast Beef. — In roasting beef, if 
an onion is placed on the top of the 
meat during cooking, it will add great- 
ly to its flavor. It should be removed 
before serving. 

Hani. — Boil a ham in clear water 
one hour or more, according to size; 
take it out of the water and rub it off 
with a clean cloth and remove the 
skin ; put it in a kettle, pour wine 
over it, and keep it closely covered, 
steadily boiling one hour. It is very 
nice browned in an oven half an hour 
with brown sugar sprinkled over it. 

Boiled Ham. — Wash a ham nice- 
ly in warm water ; rub it well with a 
wet cloth. Have a kettle filled with 
cold water and put your ham in ; let it 
boil slowly at first, and then boil 
briskly. Turn in the pot occasionally, 
allowing four hours to thoroughly 
cook a ten-pound ham ; three hours 
for a small one. 

Baked Ham. — For baking take 
a small- or medium-sized ham, trimmed 
and made into good shape. The even- 
ing previous to cooking soak in a pan 
of hot water three or four hours ; in 
the morning make a stiff paste of rye 
meal mixed with water, and cover the 
ham entirely with the paste ; bake 
five to six hours in a moderate oven. 
When done remove the crust, take off 
the skin, and dredge with powdered 
bread-crumbs. A ham can scarcely 
be cooked too much or too slowly. 
Save the skin entire to cover the cold 
ham when it is put away in the pantry. 

Madeira Ham. — Take a ham of 
fine quality, lay it in hot water, soak a 
day and a night, changing the water 
several times, washing out the pan 
each time. On the morning of the

second day put the ham into a large 
pot of cold water, and boil slowly four 
hours, skimming well. Then take 
from the fire, remove the skin, and 
put the ham into a clean boiler, with 
sufficient Madeira wine to cover it 
well. Stew for an hour, keeping the 
pot tightly covered, except when turn- 
ing the ham. When stewed drain the 
liquor into a porcelain-lined saucepan. 
Cover the ham all over w^ith a thick 
coating of powdered sugar and bake 
for an hour in a hot oven. Mix some 
orange- or lemon-juice with the liquor 
in the saucepan, add sugar and nut- 
meg, give one boil up, and serve sepa- 
rately as a sauce for the ham. 

Fried Bacon. — Bacon, cut into 
thin slices and browned in a frying- 
pan, makes a very nice relish with 
many kinds of meat, and served with 
fried calves' liver it is an excellent 
breakfast dish. 

Spiced Tomato Steak. — Take 
a thick slice of steak cut from the 
round, cut gashes and fill the same 
with powdered cracker and 'spices, 
then roll up tightly and tie with a 
string. Take a quart of canned to- 
mato in a tight saucepan and place the 
meat in it; cover tightly, and let it 
cook slowly for two and a half or three 
hours, until the meat is thoroughly 
done. Untie the meat and serve on 
a platter, with the tomato poured over 
it. 

Pepperpot. — Boil six pounds of 
tripe for one hour, then take it from 
the water in which it has boiled and 
put in fresh water with a knuckle of 
veal. Let these boil for two hours, 
then add potatoes, onions, carrots, a 
little parsley, some celery salt or 
stalks of celery, and any other herb or 
vegetables desired; plenty of salt is 
essential, and considerable black pep- 
per. When the tripe is tender, cut it 
into small bits and put back into the 
kettle. After removing the vegeta- 
bles make a nice gravy. Dumplings 
may be served with this. The best 
way to cook them is to steam them 
and then drop them into the boiling 
gravy just before serving. They will 
be thoroughly cooked and be light if 
steamed for three-quarters of an hour. 



Beef Scallop. — Two cupfuls of 
cold, underdone roast beef, one cup- 
ful of raw potatoes cut into dice, two 
beaten eggs, mustard, pepper, salt, 
and a teaspoonful of finely minced 
onion, one cupful of gravy or stock. 
Peel and cut the ]>otatoes, lay them in 
cold water for half an hour, drain, 
cover them with boiling salted water 
and stew gently ten minutes; drain 
off the water, add the gravy and the 
beef chopped fine ; cook slowly for 
ten minutes, turn into a bowl, beat in 
the eggs, the onion, salt, pepper, and 
mustard, put into a greased baking 
dish, strew crumbs on top, bake 
covered half an hour, then brown. 

Boiled Turkey. — For boiling se- 
lect a fat hen turkey; fill the breast 
with stuffing made of a quarter of a 
pound of grated bread-crumbs, mixed 
with two large tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, seasoned with a little pepper and 
salt, a large teaspoonful of powdered 
nutmeg and mace mixed together, a 
tablespoonful of sweet herbs, and the 
crumbled yolks of two hard-boiled 
eggs ; add the grated yellow rind and 
the juice of a lemon, and mix well. 
Put the turkey in a large pot with 
plenty of cold water, and boil gently 
for two hours or more, in proportion 
to its size ; carefully removing the 
scum as it rises. It will be whiter if 
boiled in a cloth. Serve with oyster 
sauce (see page 5). To ascertain if 
done, try the thickest parts with a 
large needle ; if it passes in and out 
easily it is done. 

Tripe. — Because tripe is so delicate 
and easily digested it is a proper article 
of diet for dyspeptics, yet those having 
digestive organs that never rebel, how- 
ever heavily loaded, will hardly be 
willing to grant those less favored in 
this particular the exclusive right to 
the snowy honeycomb. It is too much 
a favorite to be appropriated by one 
class without a protest. The manner 
of preparing it as practiced by our 
great-grandmothers, whose culinary 
labors reach back much farther than 
those of the present generation, re- 
quired so much labor that the delicate 
woman wisely said, "it didn't pay to 
attempt to make it ready for the

table." The beefs stomach was sewed 
up after being turned, and this was 
done at the barn with the mercury, 
perhaps, low in the twenties ; it was 
then taken to the house and washed 
well, sprinkled thickly with salt and 
covered with water. The next day it 
was scraped and the water changed ; 
the salt water was renewed for five 
days, also the scraping at intervals ; 
it was soaked in fresh water for one 
da3', and then the tripe was cut in 
pieces, and the final scraping removed 
any remnants of the dark coating. 
Only the few now think of dressing a 
trijie, as the butcher brings it to the 
door cleaned and boiled, and such do 
not find the process of cleansing ex- 
haustive, as lime is a friendly helper. 
Pour hot water on a quart of air- 
slaked lime in the vessel containing 
the tripe, and in two hours, or possi- 
bly one, all extraneous matter will 
yield to the knife, and the inner sur- 
face will be as white as the outer. 
Wash the tripe and soak for a day at 
least in cold water, renewing the 
water once or twice ; then examine 
very carefully, and cut off the tallow, 
and it is ready foi boiling. Cut it in 
pieces, cover with cold water, and 
cook eight or ten hours until tender. 
Salt added an hour before the tripe is 
done improves the flavor, but will 
give it a greyish hue if it is boiled in 
an iron kettle. Directions for pre- 
paring tripe for the table are noted 
iDelow. 

Broiled Tripe. — When the tripe 
is well boiled, cut in pieces that can 
be accommodated upon the girdiron, 
and broil quickly- Season with plenty 
of butter, salt and pepper to taste. 

Fried Tripe. — Roll the boiled 
tripe, cut in squares, in egg, then in 
cracker - crumbs, and fry to a nice 
brown. Serve with catchup. 

Stewed Tripe. — Cut the boiled 
tripe into small pieces and add three 
or four small onions; pour over the 
tripe and onions a little warm water. 
Let it cook slowly until both are ten- 
der and the water nearly boiled away. 
Then add milk sufficient to make a 
good gravy, a tablespoonful of butter 
made smooth in an equal quantity of 



flour; salt and pepper to taste, and 
boil three minutes. 

Tripe Curry. — Boil two pounds 
of tripe and cut into strips ; peel two 
large onions and cut them into square 
pieces, and ])ut the onions into a siew- 
pan with three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter. Let it stew till brown, stirring 
well, and mixing a tablespoonful of 
curry powder. Now add one pint of 
milk and the cut-up tripe. Let all 
stew for an hour, skimming it well. 
Serve in a deep dish, with boiled rice. 



Bi^ead. 



Yeast. — One cupful of hops, two- 
thirds cupful of malt, both thoroughly 
boiled in four quarts of water in a 
porcelain kettle ; never in tin or iron. 
Mix one cupful of flour, one cupful of 
sugar, two-thirds cupful of salt to- 
gether in an earthen dish; strain the 
water from the hops and malt boiling 
hot over this, straining it quickly and 
thoroughly. When cold add to it one 
pint of yeast, and keep it quite warm, 
but not hot, until it begins to ferment. 
Bottle next day. 

Yeast No.' 2. — Put a large hand- 
ful of hops into a gallon of water, boil 
it until a light brown color, with two 
Irish potatoes sliced in it ; when the 
potatoes are soft strain it into a 
wooden bowl; stir one quart of flour 
into a paste with cold water, and when 
the hop tea is cool stir it in. Then 
return it to the kettle and put oyer 
the fire to thicken, stirring it all the 
time. As soon as it is thoroughly 
heated, pour again into the wooden 
bowl to cool, occasionally stirring it. 
When perfectly cold, put' it in a stone 
jug with a loose stopper; set it in a 
warm place to rise, placing the jug in 
a pan to catch what yeast runs over. 
When it is done rising put it away in 
a jug, filling it only two-thirds full. 
Two spoonfuls of honey or a cup of 
sugar mav be added be'fore putting it 
in the jug, or a teaspoonful of sugar 
to half a pint when used. Use one- 
half pint to two f[uarts of flour. 

Brown Bread. — Three cupfuls of 
rye meal, two cupfuls of Indian meal,

ring, and add one-fourth teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar just before remov- 
ing from the fire. Wash the figs, cut 
open and lay in a flat dish, and pour 
the candy over them. 

Butter Taffy. — One-quarter cup- 
ful of butter, two cupfuls of light- 



brown sugar, four tablespoonfuls of 
molasses, two tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar, two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Boil till it is brittle in water; pour 
into pans and cool. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Boil one 
cupful of molasses and two cupfuls of 
sugar ten minutes, then add butter the 
size of an egg, one-half pound of 
chocolate, and one large tablespoonful 
of flour, and boil twenty minutes. 

Molasses Candy. — Two cupfuls 
of molasses, one tablespoonful of 
sugar; stir occasionally while boiling, 
and before taking from the fire add 
a small piece of butter and one-third 
teaspoonful of soda. Pour into but- 
tered tins and pull when cool enough. 

Ice Cream Candy. — To two cup- 
fuls of granulated sugar add one half 
cupful of water, one-fourth teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar dissolved in water 
when it boils, and boil ten minutes 
without stirring; before taking from 
the stove, add butter half the size of 
an egg, and pull it as hot as possible, 
flavoring with checkerberry, lemon, or 
vanilla, while working it. 

Butter Scotch. — Take three 
pounds of best brown sugar and boil 
with one and one-half pints of water 
until the candy hardens in cold water, 
then add one cupful of fresh butter, 
which will soften the candy ; boil again 
a few minutes, and pour into trays. 
Flavor with lemon if desired. Cut in 
small squares. 

Cream Walnuts. — Into the white 
of one egg stir sufficient white sugar 
to make it stiff enough to work easily, 
and flavor with vanilla. Boil two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and half as 
much water about four minutes ; dip 
the walnuts in this, then place a little 
of the cream between the halves of 
the nuts. A tablespoonful of melted 
chocolate added to half the cream will 
make chocolate cream walnuts. 

Hoarhound Candy. — Make with 
hoarhound herb a strong tea, sweeten 
quite strongly with sugar, and boil 
until quite stiff. Skim carefully and 
pour into a tin pan to cool. When 
partially cooled mark off into squares 
of convenient size. This candy is 
excellent for coughs.

Helpful Hints 

Soup should not be set away in iron 
vessels. 

There is no surer preventive of 
morning headaches than a well-ven- 
tilated sleeping apartment. 

Try washing tin-ware in hot suds 
water occasionally to restore its pris- 
tine brilliancy. 

Ammonia is useful in cleansing sil- 
ver-ware. 

It is said that a bit of alum in the 
mouth, before taking nauseous medi- 
cine, will prevent any unpleasant 
taste. 

Rock alum boiled in strong lye, in 
the proportion of an ounce to a pint, 
is a brightening wash for brass orna- 
ments. 

To prevent shrinkage in flannels, 
use quite zuarm, soft water for wash- 
ing. Make a suds of soft soap, or 
shaved bar soap, and turn the gar- 
ments before wetting them. Squeeze 
rather than rub out the dirt, rinse in 
plenty of warm water, and dry quickly. 
If they are smoothed with an iron, 
let it be done on the wrong side. 

The useful chamois skin is easily 
cleansed. Rub into it plenty of soft 
soap, then lay it for a couple of hours 
in a weak, but warm solution of soda 
water; rub until it is quite clean, and 
rinse in warm water in which soda 
and hard soap have been dissolved. 
Dry in a rough towel, then pull into 
shape and brush. 

Flannel that has grown yellow by 
repeated washing will whiten consid- 
erably if left out of doors on a cold 
night. 

Keep ap])les in a dry place, as 
cool as possible without freezing. 

Keep your brooms in the cellar- 
way to keep soft and pliant. 

Keep cranberries under water in 
the cellar; change the water monthly. 

Keep flour cool, dry, and securely 
covered. 

Keep glass clean with a mixture of 
one quart of water and one table- 
spoonful of ammonia. 

Keep an account of all supplies, 
with cost and date of purchase. 

Economise time, health, and means. 



A DISH of hot water set in the oven 
prevents cake scorching. 

Gr.\nulated sugar is the best for 
general family use. 

Equal parts of Japan and green 
tea are as good as English Breakfast. 

A CEMENT of ashes, salt, and water 
is excellent for cracks in stoves. 

ZiNC-LiNED sinks are better than 
wooden ones. 

A LITTE bag of mustard laid on 
the top of the pickle jar will prevent 
the vinegar from becoming moldy if 
the pickles have been put up in vine- 
gar that has not been boiled. 

Sunshine on mirrors will injure 
their lustre, therefore do not hang 
opposite a door or window. 

Red ants will never be found in 
closets or drawers if a small bag of 
sulphur is kept in those places. 

If the saucepan in which milk is to 
be boiled be first moistened with 
water, it will prevent the milk from 
burning. 

Should the varnish on a piano 
tarnish or become cloudy, wipe with 
chamois skin or soft cloth dampened 
with wat*i-, then with a dry soft cloth. 
Next rub the surface thoroughly with 
a few drops of sweet oil and turpen- 
tine, and then remove these by rub- 
bing. Sandpaper will whiten ivory 
knife-handles that may have become 
yellow with use and age. 

A Pomade for the Hands. — 
For a very nice pomade for the hands 
scrape off equal quantities of sper- 
maceti and pure beeswax, cover with 
sweet oil, and simmer until it becomes 
liquid in a small china pot, cuj:), or 
jar ; add a few drops of rose-water 
and mix with the other ingredients. 
When well blended, take it from the 
fire and let it set firm in the cup in 
which it has been melted. Rub this 
well into your hands on retiring, and 
wear a pair of soft kid gloves. In the 
morning wash them with oatmeal or 
almond j^owder. 

To Egg Buyers. — La N'attcre 
asserts that the age of eggs can be 
accuratelv determined by the follow- 
ing method : Dissolve two ounces of 
kitchen salt in a pint of water. A 
fresh laid egg if put in this solution

will sink to the bottom ; one laid a 
day previous will not quite reach the 
bottom ; an egg three days old will 
swim in the liquid, and one older will 
float on the surface, projecting itself 
above the water more and more in 
proportion to its age. 

Some Uses of an Egg. — For 
burns and scalds nothing is more 
soothing than the white of an egg, 
which may be bound over the wound. 
It is softer as a varnish than collodion, 
and being always at hand, can be easi- 
ly applied. It is also more cooling 
than the sweet oil and cotton which 
were formerly supposed to be the sur- 
est application to allay the smarting 
pain. The egg is considered to be 
one of the best of remedies for dysen- 
tery. Beaten up slightly with or with- 
out sugar, and swallowed at a gulp, it 
tends, by its emollient qualities, to 
lessen the inflammation of the stomach 
and intestines, and by forming a trans- 
ient coating on these organs to ena- 
ble Nature to resume her healthful 
sway over a diseased body. Two or 
at most three eggs per day would be 
all that are required in ordinary cases ; 
and since egg is not merely medicine, 
but food as well, the lighter the diet 
otherwise and the quieter the patient 
is kept, the more certain and rapid 
is the recovery. 

To Remove Ink Stains. — A 
solution of oxalic acid has been used 
for removing ink stains from cotton, 
linen, or the fingers, but it is attended 
with the danger of injuring textiles 
and the skin. A much safer and bet- 
ter treatment of ink or rust stains 
consists of the application of two 
parts of powdered cream of tartar, and 
one part of finely ]3owered oxalic acid. 
Shake the ingredients well together 
and apply the powder with a dry rag 
to the dampened stain ; when the spot 
has disappeared the part should be 
well washed. To remove ink stains 
from paper, make a solution of fresh 
muriate of tin, two drams ; water, 
four drams; and apply with a camel's 
hair brush. 

Moth Preventive. — The follow- 
ing recipe for keeping moths out of 
clothing is a favorite in some families: 



Mix half a ]iint of alcohol, the same 
quantity of spirits of turpentine, and 
two ounces of camphor. Keep in a 
stone bottle, and shake before using. 
The clothes or furs are to be wrapped 
in linen, and crumpled-up pieces of 
blotting-paper dipped in the liquid are 
to be placed in a box with them, so 
that it smells strong. This requires 
renewing about once a year. 

Buffalo Bugs. — A correspondent 
iA Good I/oHsekecping TunwouncGd a few 
months ago that she had discovered 
an agent for the destruction of the 
buffalo or carpet bug, believed to be 
equally effectual in destroying moths, 
cockroaches and other insect vermin 
that infest our houses. The remedy 
is borax, saltpetre, and camphor in 
equal parts, powdered and combined 
and sprinkled about the haunts of the 
vermin. Neither of these ingredients 
alone will accomplish the work ; com- 
bined they are all-powerful. We 
k7iow this remedy is effective in ban- 
ishing cockroaches and water-bugs, 
and doubt not it will prove equally a 
terror to moths and other insect pests 
of the household. 



f^eady l^emedies. 

Bleeding at the Nose. — Keep 
erect, or nearly so. Do not bend over 
a basin ; have nothing tight about the 
neck. Apply cold water or ice to the 
back of the neck and root of the nose. 
If the bleeding continues, take a long 
strip of rag, push it gently into the 
bleeding nostril with a pencil or pen- 
holder, and work it up by degrees till 
the nostril is filled. The blood will 
clog about it and stop. 

A Bruise. — In case of a bruise you 
must avoid the tendency to inflamma- 
tion. Bathe it freely in warm water, 
and afterwards apply cold vinegar and 
water every hour, for a day or two; 
or if you have a tincture of arnica 
present, rub with it. Cold water 
poured from a height, two or three 
times a day, is good. 

Sprains. — Keep the injured part 
quiet and raised; lie or sit down, and 
apply cold water to allay the inflam-

mation. Afterwards apply arnica. If 
there is much heat, apply rags wet in 
witch-hazel. When the violent effects 
have passed away, a gentle motion of 
the parts may be begun ; keep the 
joint tightly bandaged. 

Frost Bite. — Never apply heat, 
but gradually restore the circulation 
by friction with ice or snow, and then 
water with a little spirits in it. Poul- 
tice well if there is much inflammation. 

Mustard Plaster. — Take equal 
c[uantities of mustard and rye or wheat 
flour, mix together thoroughly, and 
add as much cold water as may be re- 
quired to make a soft mass. Spread 
the mixture evenly over a piece of 
muslin, and over the surface of the 
plaster put a piece of gauze to jirevent 
the mustard from adhering to the skin. 
For a child make half strength, using 
only one-quarter mustard and three- 
quarters flour. Look at the skin un- 
der the plaster every few minutes, and 
as soon as any decided redness appears, 
instantly remove the plaster. On no 
account allow it to remain sufficiently 
long to produce a blister. 

Bites and Stings. — Cologne, or 
any ordinary spirits, may be applied 
to bites of bugs, fleas, gnats, or mos- 
quitoes. Their attacks may be ward- 
ed off by such perfume as lavender, 
quassia, wormwood, gentian, or cam- 
phor. In the case of honey-bee stings 
extract the sting with a pair of twee- 
zers. Bee-stings in general may be 
treated with turpentine, hot vinegar, 
hartshorn, or spirits. Soap and cam- 
phor liniment are good to remove 
swelling. 

Flaxseed Poultice. — Make a 
thick paste of flaxseed meal and cold 
water, heat the mixture, and add a 
small piece of lard to prevent it ad- 
hering to the part. Apply as hot as 
possible. 

Bread-and-water Poultice is 
made by dipping a piece of bread, 
after the crust has been removed, into 
warm water. Lift it out at once and 
apply hot. 

Bread-and-milk Poultice is 
made l)y removing the crust from a 
stale piece of bread and crumbling 
the inner part into a bowl. Pour on 



enough sweet milk to cover it and sim- 
mer on the fire, stirring till the bread is 
dissolved. Apply hot as can be borne. 

Sand-bag. — A bag of hot sand for 
artificial heating purposes will retain 
the heat much longer than hot water. 

Egg Toast for Invalids. — Beat 
the yolks of four eggs and the whites 
of two thoroughly, and mix them with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter; put this 
in a small saucepan and set it over the 
fire, stirring in one direction until 
thoroughly hot. Have ready some 
thin slices of bread delicately toasted, 
and spread with the mixture of egg, 
and serve very hot. Or, put three 
ounces of butter into a bowl, and 
stand the latter in boiling water until 
it becomes liquid. Now add four 
well-beaten eggs to this, pour into a 
saucepan and set it over a slow fire, 
moving it around in one direction until 
heated; it must not be allowed to boil. 
As soon as warm pour it back and 
forth from the saucepan to the bowl 
until thoroughly hot. Have ready 
some nicely toasted bread, and spread 
this over while hot. 

For Rheumatism. — Grace Court- 
land, " the prophetic witch of Wall 
street," says : " My remedy for acute 
rheumatism is one ounce of saltpetre 
in one pint of brandy, taken in tea- 
spoonfuls three or four times a day." 

The Sick-Room. — The sick-room 
should have plenty of fresh air ; this 
is especially so in case of fevers. An 
inch at the top of a window and an 
inch at the bottom may be allowed, 
even in cold weather. Sick persons 
will not take cold any quicker than 
well ones, if the draught does not 
strike them. Where there are win- 
dows in the opposite sides of a room, 
the task of ventilation is easier; but 
there must be greater care with the 
draughts. If the bed is where a 
draught can not be avoided, cover the 
patient up and let ventilation take 
place, at least three times a day. 
Keep the inside air as pure as that 
outside, without chilling the patient. 
A fire in the sick-room, to take off the 
chill, will enable one to give it full 
ventilation.

floors of sick-rooms. In any case of 
contagious disease or fever it would be 
best to take the carpet off. If not, 
clean well first, and afterwards. 

Sick people like to be clean. They 
enjoy a wash. They can be washed 
nicely by sponging, or by using a rag 
judiciously. Care must be taken not 
to expose too much of the skin at 
once. Let the water be tepid. Do not 
withhold soap. Rub each portion 
washed right well with a coarse towel. 
Vinegar added to the water makes it 
more refreshing. A bay-rum bath is 
an excellent tonic for sick folk. 

Never shut the sunlight from a sick- 
room; light is next to air in healing 
virtue. Of course there are certain 
affections of the eyes that require ex- 
clusion of light ; but healing comes 
where light sheds its radiance. 

Avoid noises, and especially the dis- 
turbing kind. Every patient is sensi- 
tive to some kind of a noise more than 
another. Never awaken a sleeping 
patient for any purpose, unless the 
physician requires it. Sleep is the 
best medicine in Nature. 

Do not go to the bedside with a sour 
face, and never whisper with the phy- 
sician or friends in the sick-room. 

All appearance of haste is painful 
to the sick. Do things quickly, by 
knowing what to do and how to do 



them ; but do them quietly and with- 
out fuss and hurry. A patient will 
pick out and rely on a cool-headed, 
quiet, prompt person every time. 

Do not bother a sick person when he 
is doing any thing, nor interrupt him 
when speaking. Neve** lean against, 
sit upon, or shake the bed upon which 
a sick person lies. 

Never read to the sick except when 
they ask it ; then read what they crave, 
and do it slowly and distinctly. 

Give a little variety to the room by 
occasionally changing things. If flow- 
ers are craved, get them, but beware 
of the effect of very sweet perfumes. 

Give little food at a time, but often, 
if it is craved. As a rule, sick folk 
have slow appetites in the morning. 
You can sustain them, till they get a 
desire for something substantial, by 
giving them a little tea or light broth. 

Never leave untasted food at the 
patient's bedside from meal to meal. 
Sight of what is not craved is repel- 
lant. 

Do not fill a patient's plate. Have 
tempting quantities temptingly pre- 
pared and served. Cook with care. 

As a rule you can afford to give a 
patient a little of whatever is craved, 
unless the physician forbids. Some- 
times the craving is morbid ; then you 
can refuse to gratify it.
