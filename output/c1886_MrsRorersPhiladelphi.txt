PREFACE 



To offer to the American housewives a new Cook 
Book may appear to many an unnecessary labor, con- 
sidering the country is already provided with elaborate 
works on the subject; but upon referring to many of 
them, I have often detected an obscurity in directions 
in recipes which, in the hands of an amateur, would 
lead to failure, and have in the following recipes 
endeavored to avoid this by making them so plain, 
that a beginner may successfully make, with few 
exceptions, any dish contained herein, and I may add, 
all these recipes have been prepared over and over 
again by pupils under my supervision. 

It has been many years since Philadelphia has 
contributed a publication of this kind, and as she 
occupies a place second to none in the science, her 
peculiar dishes being known not only in this country 
but abroad as well, it seems appropriate that she should 
be newly represented.

viii PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Under each heading I have endeavored to give in 
a simple manner a brief introduction, explaining the 
chemistry of the article, mode of selecting, and such 
other information as I thought would be of interest 
to the reader. 

References to Sick Diet or Medicated Food 
have purposely been avoided, as there is in prepara- 
tion a work on Dietetics, which will contain all the 
recipes collected and tried during my connection with 
hospitals. 

" Before the housewife now my book is laid 
' T will aid her, if its teachings be obeyed."

SOUPS 



The first and most important point in making good soup 
is to have the best of materials. To make our soup a 
perfect food we must change the solid meat into a liquid 
form ; to do this, we must first soften the fibrin, so as to draw 
out the juices and blood, consisting of albumen and fat ; 
the gelatine, which exists in the bone, cartilages, membranes 
and skin, which is nitrogenous matter, but not nutritious; 
and the osmazome, that substance which gives odor and 
flavor. As a low degree of heat changes the albumen 
(which is exactly similar to the white of an egg} into a solid 
form, we at once see the necessity of using cold soft water. 
Soft water, because it makes its way into the tissues more 
readily than hard water, thereby softening the texture of 
the meat and allowing the juices to escape more easily ; and 
we also see the importance of not boiling the soup, as the 
albumen on the surface of the meat immediately coagulates 
and prevents the gelatine, fat and osmazome from dissolving 
and being drawn out into the water. Salt should never be 
added until the soup is done, as it hardens the water; and 
we have found that soft water is the best. As the water 
begins to heat a small portion of albumen coagulates, form- 
ing a fine fibrous net throughout the liquid entangling any 

substance that may be floating in it, bringing it first to the 

W

surface and then settling to the bottom, showing that we 
must watch and skim at this time to have a clear soup. 

You will notice that in the recipes for Consomme and 
Bouillon, to clarify, we boil after adding the whites of the 
eggs, thereby making a perfectly clear soup, but a stimulant 
rather than nutrient, as we rob it of its albumen and fibrin 
by boiling and straining; two things which cannot exist at 
the same time, a very clear and a very nutritious soup. 

Another very important point is to have a porcelain- 
lined or better still a granite iron soup kettle with a close 
cover. Why? Because the juices of the meat are always 
acid and will act upon a metallic kettle thereby giving the 
soup an inky, bitter taste. A close cover to keep in the 
steam and prevent evaporation and also to keep the dust 
and smoke out. 



SOUPS FROM STOCK 

SOUP STOCK 

i shin of beef 2 bay leaves 

5 quarts of cold water i sprig of parsley 
i onion 12 cloves 

i carrot i stalk of celery 

i turnip i tablespoonful of salt 

Lean, uncooked juicy beef should form the basis of your 
soup. No cooked or stale meats should be used for clear 
stock. Wipe the meat well with a damp towel ; now cut all 
the meat from the bones. Place the bones in the bottom 
of a large porcelain-lined or granite soup kettle, lay the 
meat on top of them, add the water and stand the kettle on 
the back part of the range for one hour ; then place it over 
a good fire. After about thirty minutes, the scum of the 
meat will gather on the surface, and the water will begin to 



SOUPS 3 

steam. Now place it over a more moderate fire, add one 
cup of cold water, and skim off the scum. Now cover the 
kettle closely and let it simmer (not boil) for four hours; 
then add the vegetables and simmer one hour longer. Then 
strain the stock through a fine sieve, add the salt and stand at 
once in a cold place to cool. If you keep it in a warm place 
for a few hours it will not make a nice jelly. When cold, 
take all the grease from the surface, and it is ready for use. 

BARLEY SOUP 

2 tablespoon fuls of pearl barley 

i quart of stock 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the barley in cold water; then cover it with boiling 
water, let it boil up once and drain it. Cover it again 
with boiling water and simmer it for two hours. Drain ; 
add to the stock when boiling ; let it stand on the back part 
of the range for ten minutes ; add salt and pepper, and serve. 

BLACK BEAN SOUP 

i pint of turtle beans 2 hard-boiled eggs 

T.i/2 quarts of boiling water i lemon 

i quart of stork Salt and pepper to taste 

If you use wine, i gill 

Wash the beans well in cold water and soak them over 
night. In the morning, drain the water off and cover them 
again with one quart of the boiling water. Boil until tender, 
about two hours. Now add the stock and the pint of boil- 
ing water. Press the whole through a sieve; wash the 
kettle, return the soup and bring it to a boil ; add salt and 
pepper. Cut the eggs and lemon into slices and put into the 
tureen, pour the boiling soup over,and serve. 

If wine is used, put it in the tureen with the lemon and 
egg- 



4 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

DRIED BEAN SOUP 

I pint dried beans i quart of stock 

Y^, pound of ham i^ quarts of boiling water 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the beans and soak them over night. In the morn- 
ing drain the water off, and cover them again with the 
boiling water; add the ham and boil gently two hours. 
Now add the stock. Press the beans through a sieve, return 
them to the soup kettle and bring to a boil. Add salt and 
pepper, and serve with toasted bread. 

DRIED BEAN SOUP WITHOUT MEAT 

1 quart of dried white soup beans 

2 quarts of water 

i large tablespoonful of butter 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the beans, cover them with water and soak over night. 
Next morning, drain, put them on to boil with two quarts of 
fresh cold water. As soon as they come to a boil, drain this 
water off and throw it away, this prevents the soup from being 
strong. Now cover again with two quarts of fresh boiling 
water, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda, 
and boil until reduced to a pulp. Now press the beans 
through a sieve, return to the soup kettle and add sufficient 
water to make the soup about the consistency of cream, 
add the salt, pepper and butter and serve with croutons. 



CLEAR SOUP WITH CROUTONS 

i quart of stock 
y>, pint of croutons 

Salt and white pepper to taste 

To make the croutons, cut stale bread into thin slices, 
spread it lightly with butter on one side, then cut into 
dice. (It will take about three slices from a baker's square 



SOUPS 5 

five cent loaf.) Place them on a tin pie dish, and put them 
in a moderate oven until a golden brown. 

Melt the stock gradually, bring it to boiling point, add 
salt and pepper. Serve soup in a tureen with croutons on 
a separate dish. If you put them in the soup when you 
dish it, they will become heavy and waxy before it reaches 
the dining room. 

If the soup is too light, color it with caramel. (See 
recipe for making it.) 

CLEAR VEGETABLE SOUP 



2 quarts of stock 

i quart of boiling water 

i small carrot 

i turnip 

i sweet potato 



white potato 
ear of corn 
cupful of peas 
cupful of beans 



tomato 



i tablespoon ful of rice or barley 
Put the water into a soup kettle, cut the vegetables into 
pieces of uniform size, otherwise the smaller ones will dis- 
solve and impair the transparency of the soup. (There are 
various small tin cutters that can be purchased for this pur- 
posi'.) Put the carrot and turnip on rd boil; after they 
have boiled one hour, add all the other vegetables and rice 
and boil until tender. Now add the stock, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Let it boil up once and serve.

and the head of cauliflower into flowerets. Put them into 
a kettle, cover with boiling water, and boil fifteen minutes ; 
then drain them in a colander. 

Melt the stock and bring it to a boil ; put the vege- 
tables from the colander into it and simmer half an hour. 
Put the peas and asparagus heads into boiling water and 
simmer them for twenty minutes ; then drain and add them 
to the boiling soup, then the lettuce, cut into pieces the 
size of a half-dollar (the lettuce should cook about ten 
minutes) ; add salt and pepper, and serve at once.

ing drain off the water, add the stock and simmer gently 
until the lentils are tender, about one and a half hours. 
Put the butter into a frying-pan and, when melted, add the 
onion cut in slices, parsley, thyme and bay leaf. Fry 
(saute) until brown. Now add these to the lentils and 
simmer a half hour longer. Now press the whole through 
a sieve. 

Return it to the soup kettle, boil up once, add salt and 
pepper and serve with toasted bread cut into small squares.

add the macaroni, let it simmer five minutes, add salt and 
pepper and serve. A plate of Parmesan may be served 
with this if liked. 

NOODLE SOUP (Beef) 
2 quarts of stock 

The quantity of noodles given in recipe for noodles 
Salt and pepper 

Melt the stock, then bring it to boiling point, add the 
noodles; boil fifteen minutes; add salt and pepper and 
serve at once.

out the centres and mash well. Add to them the chopped 
meat of the chicken, butter, nutmeg, yolks of eggs, a quar- 
ter of a teaspoon ful of salt, and a little pepper. Mix all 



SOUPS 11 

well together. Form into balls about a half-inch in diam- 
eter, then fry them in butter until a light brown. Put 
them into the soup tureen. Strain the soup, skim all the 
fat from the surface, season with salt and pepper, let it boil 
up once, pour it over the balls and serve immediately. 

Should you be obliged to keep this soup waiting, allow

i quart of cold water half teaspoon ful 

i small onion of celery seed 

i bay leaf Sprig of parsley

cover the kettle closely and place it on the back part of 
the range for two hours. Then place it over a good fire ; 
skim at the first boil. Now place it over a moderate fire 
and simmer gently four hours. Strain, return it to the 
soup kettle, add salt and pepper. Beat the white of one 
egg with half a cup of cold water until thoroughly mixed. 
Wash the egg shell, mash it and add it to the white. In 
breaking the egg, take care to separate it so nicely that 
none of the yellow gets into the white as the smallest por- 
tion of the yellow will prevent the bouillon from being 
perfectly clear. Now add the white, shell and water to the 
boiling bouillon ; let it boil hard for ten minutes ; then 
throw in one gill of cold water and boil five minutes longer; 
then take the kettle off the fire and strain through a flannel 
bag, add salt to taste and color with caramel about 
half a teaspoonful to a quart. (See recipe for Caramel.)

3 quarts of cold water Sprig of parsley 

4 cloves i bay leaf 

i onion Sprig of sweet marjoram 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the head well through three waters; scald it; wash it 
again in cold water, and soak it fifteen minutes. Be sure 
that throat and nasal passages are perfectly clean. Now 
put it into a soup kettle with the cold water. Bring it 
slowly to a boil and let it simmer gently for five hours, 
skimming it carefully until no more scum rises. Put in 
the vegetables and spices one hour before the soup is 
done. When done, strain and stand away to cool. Do 
this the day before you want to use it; when cool, remove 
all the fat from the surface. Make force-meat balls as fol- 
lows : one cup of meat from the head, chopped fine; add 
to it a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, the grated peel 
of half a lemon, one raw egg, one tablespoonful of flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and a little black pepper. Mix 
well and form into little balls the size of a hickory nut. 
Fry them in butter until a golden brown. 

When ready to use bring the soup to boiling point, sea- 
son with a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, salt and 
pepper. Put into a two-quart stewing-pan two ounces (two 
tablespoonfuls) of butter, and when it bubbles, stir in two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of flour. Mix well, add to this the 
soup, stir constantly until it boils. Put the force-meat balls 
into the tureen, pour over the boiling soup and, if you 
use it, add one glass of Sherry or Madeira. The brains 
should be taken out of the head before boiling. They 
can be used for another dish. (See recipe for cooking 
calf's brains.)

GREEN TURTLE SOUP (The Caterer) 
The day before you intend to dress the turtle cut off its head; 
and to do this properly you should hang up the victim with 
its head downwards, use a very sharp knife and make the 
incision as close to the head as possible. You must not be 



32 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

surprised at seeing, many hours after the decollation, the 
creature exhibit extraordinary signs of muscular motion, 
by the flapping of his fins. Separate the upper from the 
lower shell, and in this operation be very careful not to 
touch the gall bladder, which is very large and, if pene- 
trated, would completely destroy the flesh over which its 
contents ran. Cut the meat of the breast in a half-dozen 
pieces ; abstract the gall and entrails and throw them away 
at once. Separate the fins as near the shell as possible, 
abstract the green fat and put it on a separate dish from the 
white meat. Boil the upper and lower shells in water suffi- 
ciently long to enable you to take away the bones. Then 
remove with a spoon the mucilage that you find adhering to 
the shells ; put this also in a separate dish. Into the largest 
stewpan your kitchen affords put the head, fins, liver, 
lights, heart and all the flesh, a pound of ham, nine or 
ten cloves, a couple of bay leaves, a good-sized bunch 
of sweet herbs (such as winter savory, marjoram, basil, 
thyme), a silver onion cut into slices and a bunch of 
parsley. Cover all these with the liquor in which you have 
boiled the shells and let it simmer till the meat be thor- 
oughly done, which you can ascertain by pricking with a 
fork and observing if any blood exudes ; when none ap- 
pears, strain the liquor through a fine sieve and return it to 
the stewpan, which may remain at some distance from the 
fire. Cut the meat into square bits of about an inch. Put 
the herbs, onion, etc., into a separate saucepan with four 
ounces of butter, three or four lumps of sugar and a bottle 
of Madeira ; let this boil slowly. Whilst this is doing, melt 
in another saucepan half a pound of fresh butter and, when 
quite dissolved, thicken it with flour, but do not make it 
too thick, and then add a pint of the liquor from the shells ; 
let this boil very gently, removing the scum as it rises. 



SOUPS 33 

When both these saucepans are ready, strain the con- 
tents of the first through a sieve, and this done, add both 
to the stewpan. Warm up the liquor from the shells, the 
green fat and mucilage and put them and the meat into 
the stewpan with the yolks of a dozen hard-boiled eggs, 
the juice of half a dozen green limes and two teaspoon- 
fuls of cayenne. Gently warm up the whole together, and 
you may regard your cookery as complete. Fill as many 
tureens as your soup will permit, and, as these are required 
for the table, take especial care to warm the soup before 
serving by putting the tureens in a hot water bath (bain- 
marie) ; boiling it up a second time would deprive this 
delicious preparation of its true flavor. 

OYSTER SOUP 

50 oysters i dozen pepper-corns 

i pint of cold water i tablespoonful of butter 
i pint of milk i tablespoonful of corn starch 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Put the oysters in a colander to drain, then pour over them 
the cold water and allow it to drain into the liquor. Now 
pour the liquor into the soup kettle, set the kettle over a 
good fire and when it boils skim it. Now add the milk 
and the pepper-corns. Rub the butter and corn starch 
together until smooth and add them to the mixture as soon 
as it boils. Stir constantly until it boils again. Wash the 
oysters, after draining, by allowing cold water to run over 
them through the colander. Now add them to the soup, 
stir continually, until it comes to a boil, add the salt and 
pepper. Serve immediately. 

Do not allow the oysters to boil, as it destroys their 
flavor and makes them tough. But be equally careful that 
the oysters are heated through, as nothing is more objec- 
tionable than a cold, uncooked oyster in a hot soup.

FISH 



The flesh of all fish out of season is unwholesome; to be 
eatable they should be perfectly fresh, the eyes clear, the gills 
red, the scales bright, the flesh firm and free from any 
unpleasant odor and, to secure the best flavor, should be 
cooked as soon as possible after leaving the sea, river or 
pond. They should be scaled and cleaned as soon as 
they come home from the market, washed quickly without 
soaking, removing the smallest atom of blood. Sprinkle 
salt on the inside and put them in a cold place until 
wanted. If necessary to keep them over night, place 
where the moon will not shine on them, as the effect is as 
bad as the hot sunshine. Cod, haddock and halibut may 
be kept a day before using, but mackerel and whitefish 
lose their life as soon as they leave the water. The fat or oil 
of most fish is found in their livers, consequently the flesh is 
white. Salmon, herring, mackerel, sturgeon and catfish 
are exceptions, having the oil distributed throughout the 
body, thereby giving color to the flesh. 

STOCK FOR BOILING FISH 

5 pounds of haddock 4 whole cloves 

1 onion i stalk of celery 

2 bay leaves 2 sprigs of parsley 

3 quarts of cold water 

(40 



42 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Clean and wash the fish, cut it into pieces about three 
inches square; put it into a soup kettle, with the water, 
onion, bay leaves, cloves, celery and parsley ; place it over 
a moderate fire and skim at the first boil. Simmer gently 
for two hours, then strain, add a tablespoonful of salt and 
it is ready for use. 

This makes a nice soup for Lent, served clear, with 
croutons. 

BOILED FISH 

Wash the fish well in cold water. Wipe it carefully, and 
rub it with a little salt. Wrap it in a cloth ; cheese cloth 
will answer. Have the cloth just large enough to envelop 
the fish. Sew the edges so that there will be but one thick- 
ness of the cloth over any part of the fish. Now put it 
into a fish kettle if you have one ; if not you may lay it on 
a platter, tie fish and platter together in a cloth and put it 
in the bottom of a large saucepan. Cover with boiling 
water, add one tablespoonful of salt and simmer very gently 
ten minutes to every pound of fish. Take the fish from the 
water the moment it is done; drain, remove the cloth care- 
fully, turn the fish on to the plate ; garnish with slices 
of lemon and parsley. Serve with either shrimp, oyster, 
Hollandaise or caper sauce, or plain drawn butter. 

All cold boiled fish left may be utilized in making 
salads, croquettes or a la cremes. 

This is a general rule for boiling all kinds of fish. 

BOILED SALMON STEAKS 

Have the steak about two inches thick; wrap in a cloth, put 
in a kettle of boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt and 
simmer twenty minutes. Serve with lobster or shrimp sauce. 
Rub the coral of the lobster fine and sprinkle over the fish. 
Halibut steaks may be boiled and served in the same way. 



FISH 43 

TO BOIL SALT CODFISH 

Wash the fish well in cold water. Cover it with fresh cold 
water and soak over night. In the morning, wash it again ; 
put it into a kettle, cover with cold water, place over a 
hot fire and bring it to boiling point. Now stand it over 
a more moderate fire for four hours. If it boils, the fish 
will become hard. When done, dish and serve with drawn 
butter. 



TO FRY FISH 

" Small fish should nvim twice, once in water and once in oil" 

Perch, brook trout, catfish and all small fish are best 
fried. They should be cleaned, washed well in cold 
water and immediately wiped dry, inside and outside, with 
a clean towel, and then sprinkled with salt. Use oil if con- 
venient, as it is very much better than either dripping or 
lard. Never use butter as it is apt to burn and has a ten- 
dency to soften the fish. See that the oil, lard or dripping 
is /W/X/^hot, before putting in the fish. Throw in a crumb 
of bread ; if it browns quickly, it is hot enough and the 
fish will not absorb any grease. 



FRIED SMELTS 

To clean them, make a slight opening at the gills, then 
draw them between the thumb and finger, beginning at the 
tail. This will press out all the insides. Wash and wipe 
them. Now sprinkle them with salt; dip them first in 
beaten eggs, and then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling 
fat. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon, and serve 
with sauce Tartare. 

Ail small fish may be fried in the same way. 



44 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

FRIED HALIBUT 

Cut the halibut steak into pieces about two inches square. 
Beat an egg, same as for fried oysters ; season the halibut 
with salt and pepper, dip first in the egg, then in bread 
crumbs, and fry a nice brown in boiling fat. Lay on brown 
paper to drain and serve on a hot dish*. 



FRIED WHITEFISH ETC. 

Scale and wash the fish. Trim off the fins and take out 
the gills. Wipe it dry immediately. Dredge it with salt, 
pepper and flour. Put four tablespoonfuls of dripping or 
lard in a frying-pan ; when hot, put the fish into it. Brown 
on one side, then turn and brown on the other. When 
done, take out carefully, put on a hot dish, garnish with 
parsley and serve. 

Bass, bluefish, porgies, flounders, weakfish and herring 
may be fried in the same way. 

TO BROIL FISH 

This is one of the nicest ways of cooking shad, bluefish, 
mackerel, salmon and the large trout. Always use a 
double broiler. Rub it well with a piece of suet before put- 
ting the fish in. A fish weighing four pounds will take 
half an hour to cook over a clear but moderate fire. The 
flesh side should be first exposed to the fire, then the skin. 
Great care must be taken not to burn the skin side. When 
the fish is done, separate it carefully from the broiler with 
a knife so as not to break the nice brown outside. Sprin- 
kle with salt and pepper, and spread it with butter, stand it 
in the oven for a moment and it is ready to serve. 

For broiling, the fish should be cleaned and split down 
the back, leaving on the head and tail. 



FISH 4o 

BROILED HALIBUT or SALMON 

Have the steak cut one inch thick, wash it quickly and care- 
fully, dry it with a towel, place it on a broiler and broil 
over a clear fire (not too hot) for ten minutes or until a 
nice brown on one side ; then turn and broil on the other 
side. Put on a hot dish, spread with butter, dredge 
with salt and pepper on both sides, garnish with pars- 
ley and serve. 


HALIBUT STEAK a la FLAMANDE 

Take a halibut steak an inch and a half thick, wash and 
wipe it dry. Butter the bottom of a roasting pan, sprinkle 
it with chopped onion, salt and pepper; put the fish on 
top of this, brush it over with the yolk of an egg, sprinkle 
thickly with chopped onion, parsley, salt and pepper, 
pour over it a teaspoonful of lemon juice, cover with a 
tablespoonful of butter cut into small bits and bake in a 
moderate oven thirty minutes. Serve on a hot dish, 
with Bechamel sauce and garnish with slices of lemon 
and parsley. 



BROILED MACKEREL (Salt) 

Wash and scrape all the thin black skin from the inside. 
Soak the fish in a large pan full of cold water over night. 
In the morning wash it in fresh water and wipe it. Brush it 
with melted butter, dredge lightly with pepper, lay it on 
a greased broiler and broil with the flesh side down over a 
clear fire ; then turn and broil the skin side. Be careful 
as it will burn very quickly on this side. When done 
lay it on a hot dish and spread with butter or serve with 
maitre d' hotel sauce. 



46 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

BROILED SMOKED SALMON 

Cut a piece of the salmon the size you wish. Wash it well 
in cold water, then cover it with boiling water and let it 
stand on the back part of the stove where it will keep warm 
(not hot) for twenty-five minutes. Then take it out, 
wipe dry and broil the same as mackerel. 

BAKED SHAD 

Scrape free from all scales, make a short opening down the 
belly and take out the insides; wash well inside and out 
and immediately wipe dry with a clean towel. Rub it well 
with salt. Make a dressing of one cup of stale bread 
crumbs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, a half teaspoonful of salt and a little 
black pepper ; mix well and stuff the body of the fish and 
sew it up with soft yarn. Now score one side of the fish 
with a sharp knife, making the scores about an inch apart, 
and put a strip of salt pork in each gash. Grease a tin 
sheet, if you have one, place it in the bottom of a baking- 
pan, put the fish on it, dredge thickly with salt, pepper 
and flour ; cover the bottom of the pan with boiling water 
and put into a hot oven. Bake fifteen minutes to every 
pound of fish, basting each ten minutes with the gravy in 
the pan. As the water evaporates add more to again cover 
the bottom of the pan. When done, lift the tin sheet 
from the pan and slide the fish carefully into the centre of 
the dish on which it is to be served ; garnish with slices 
of lemon, fried potato balls and parsley ; serve with 
sauce Hollandaise or roe sauce. If you have no tin sheet, 
place the fish in the bottom of a baking-pan and when 
done loosen it carefully and slide it into the dish. Rock 
fish may be baked in exactly the same manner. 



FISH 47 

PLANKED SHAD 
This is the very best way of cooking shad : 

The plank should be three inches thick, two feet long, 
one and a half feet wide and of well-seasoned hickory or 
oak. Pine or soft wood gives the fish a woody taste. Take 
a fine shad just from the water, scale, split it down the 
back, clean it, wash well and immediately wipe dry. Dredge 
it with salt and pepper. Place the plank before a clear fire 
to get VERY HOT. Then spread the shad open and nail it, 
skin side next to the hot plank, with four large-headed 
tacks. Put it before the fire with the large end down ; in 
a few minutes turn the board so that the other end will be 
down, and do this every few minutes until the fish is done. 
To tell when it is done pierce it with a fork ; if the flesh be 
flaky it is done. Spread with butter and serve on the 
plank or draw the tacks carefully and slide the shad on to 
a hot dish. 

The whitefish caught in the lakes are excellent when 
cooked in this manner. 

HOW TO CURE AND SMOKE SHAD ETC. 
Scale, cut the fish up the back, clean, and take out the roe. 
Wipe the fish with a damp cloth but do not wash them. 
To twenty pounds of fish allow one pint of salt, one pint 
brown sugar and one ounce of saltpetre. Mix these all 
well together. Rub the fish well inside and out with this 
mixture. Put one fish over the other with a board on top, 
and on this place heavy weights to press them down. 
Allow them to remain so for sixty hours, then drain 
them, wipe dry, stretch open and fasten with small pieces 
of stick. Smoke them for five days in a smoke-house or in 
a box, or some such place, over a smothered wood fire. 

Whitefish, salmon and other large fish may be smoked 
in the same way.

FISH 55 

LOBSTERS 

Never buy a dead lobster. Choose the smaller ones that 
are heavy for their size ; the larger ones are coarse and 
tough. They should be perfectly fresh and very lively. 
The male lobster is preferred for eating and the female for 
sauces and soups. The female has a broader tail and less 
claws than the male. If possible, always boil the lobster 
at home ; but in some localities, where it is a necessity to 
buy them boiled, see that the tail is stiff and elastic, so that 
when you bend it out, it springs back immediately ; other- 
wise they were dead before boiling. Lobsters boiled when 
dead are watery and soft ; they are very unwholesome, even 
to a dangerous degree. 

TO BOIL AND OPEN A LOBSTER 
Fill a kettle with warm water (not boiling), put in the lob- 
ster head downward, add a tablespoonful of salt, cover the 
kettle and stand it over a very quick fire. They suffer 
less by being put into warm than in boiling water. 
In the latter they are killed by heat, in warm water 
they are smothered. A medium-sized lobster should boil 
half an hour ; a larger one three-quarters. Cooking them 
too long makes them tough, and the meat will stick to the 
shell. When done and cool, separate the tail from the 
body and twist off all the claws ; shake out carefully the 
torn-alley (this is the liver of the lobster and may be known 
by its greenish color) ; also the coral. Then draw the 
body from the shell, remove the stomach (sometimes 
called the lady), which is found immediately under the 
head, and throw this away. Now split the body through the 
centre and pick the meat from the cells. Cut the under 
side of the tail shell, loosen the meat and take it out 
in one solid piece. Now split the meat of the tail open 
and you will uncover a little vein running its entire 



5(5 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

length, this remove. The vein is not always the same 
color; sometimes it is red, sometimes black and sometimes 
white; but in all cases it must be carefully taken out and 
thrown away. The stomach or lady, the vein and the spongy 
fingers between the body and shell, are the only parts not 
eatable. Crack the claws and take out the meat. 

To serve plain boiled lobster, arrange the meat thus 
taken out in the centre of a cold dish, garnishing with the 
claws, sprigs of fresh parsley, hard-boiled eggs cut into 
quarters and pickled beets cut into fancy shapes. Let each 
person season to suit one's self.

Rub the butter and flour together and stir into the milk 
when boiling ; stir until smooth, take from the fire, add the 
bread crumbs, parsley, lobster, hard-boiled eggs mashed fine, 
salt and cayenne; mix all well together. Be careful when 
opening the lobster not to break the body or tail shells. 
Wash the shells and wipe them dry, and with a sharp 
knife or scissors cut off the under part of the shell. Now 
join the large ends of the two tail shells to the body, forming 
a boat. Put the farce into these shells, brush it over the 
top with beaten egg, sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs 
and place in a quick oven for fifteen minutes to brown. 
Serve hot in the shells garnished with parsley.

the lobster. Mix well ; turn out on a dish to cool. When 
cool, form into chops, roll first in beaten egg, then in 
bread crumbs ; put them in a frying-basket and fry in 
boiling oil or dripping until a nice brown. It will take 
about two minutes. Drain, and arrange them on a hot 
dish ; put the end of a small claw in each chop to represent 
the mutton bone. Garnish with parsley, and serve with 
cream or Tartare sauce. 



DEVILED LOBSTER 

Deviled lobster is made the same as deviled crabs, using 
two cups of boiled lobster cut fine, instead of the dozen 
crabs. Serve in the lobster shells. This will require two 
small lobsters.

of the white sauce in the bottom of a baking-dish, then a 
layer of lobster, season with salt and cayenne, then a sprink- 
ling of parsley and bread crumbs, then another layer of 
white sauce, and so on until all is used, having the last 
layer sauce, sprinkled over with bread crumbs. Put in a 
quick oven fifteen minutes to brown. Serve in the dish. 

LOBSTER WITH CECIL SAUCE 

Boil a three-pound lobster and open as directed. Cut the 
meat into pieces about one inch square. Put a tablespoon- 
ful of butter into a frying-pan, and, when melted, add one 
tablespoonful of flour ; mix until smooth, add one gill of 
cream, one gill of stock, and stir constantly until it boils ; 
add the lobster, salt and pepper to taste. Heat thoroughly, 
take from the fire, add the beaten yolk of one egg and a 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley. This may be served in 
paper cases or individual dishes.

flour ; do not brown, but mix until smooth ; add the milk, 
stir constantly until it boils ; add the mushrooms chopped 
fine, salt, pepper and the lobster; stir until thoroughly 
heated. Serve in paper cases. 



CRABS 

Crabs, like lobsters, are sold alive, or boiled j they should 
be heavy for t'fteir size. 



FISH 59 

TO BOIL CRABS 

Take one dozen heavy crabs and boil, the same as lobster, 
for three-quarters of an hour. When done and cold, twist 
off the claws, take off the upper shells and remove the 
spongy substance on the outside. See that the under part 
is free from sand. Arrange them nicely on a flat dish, gar- 
nish with parsley and serve with them oil, vinegar, salt and 
pepper, allowing each person to dress his own. 

DEVILED CRABS 

12 nice, heavy crabs i tablespoonful of salt 

YZ pint of cream, i tablespoonful of butter 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour i tablespoonful of chopped 
Y of a nutmeg, grated parsley 

Yolks of four hard-boiled eggs Salt and cayenne to taste 
Put the crabs in warm water, add the salt and put the kettle 
over a brisk fire. Boil thirty minutes. Take up and drain ; 
break off all the claws, separate the shells, remove the 
spongy fingers, and the stomach, which is found under the 
head. Pick out all the meat. Put the cream on to boil ; 
rub the butter and flour together and add to the boiling 
milk ; stir and cook for two minutes. Take from the fire 
and add the crab meat, the yolks of the hard-boiled eggs 
mashed fine, the parsley, the nutmeg, salt and cayenne. 
Clean the upper shells of the crabs, fill them with the 
mixture, brush over with beaten egg, cover with bread 
crumbs and put in a quick oven to brown ; or better, 
put them in a frying-basket and plunge into boiling fat or 
oil until a nice brown. 

SOFT SHELL CRABS 

The soft shell crab is nothing more than a hard shell crab 
after shedding its shell. In about three days the new shell 
begins to harden again, which is the cause of the always- 
short supply. 



60 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Lift the shell and remove the spongy substance on both 
sides ; then put your thumb nail under the point of the 
"apron" and pull it off. The " apron" is a small, loose shell, 
running to a point in the middle of the under shell. Now 
wipe the crabs dry; if they are at all sandy, wash them before 
removing anything. Do not blanch them, as it entirely 
destroys their fine flavor. Dip them, while alive, in beaten 
egg, and then in bread crumbs which have been well sea- 
soned with salt and cayenne. Fry in boiling oil or lard for 
ten minutes; when done, drain a moment on soft brown 
paper. Put sauce Tartare in the centre of a cold, flat dish; 
arrange the crabs around this, garnish with parsley and 
lemon cut into quarters, and serve. 

SOFT CRABS FRIED IN BUTTER 

Clean the crabs same as above. Dust them with salt, pep- 
per and flour. Put three tablespoon fuls of butter into a 
frying-pan, and when hot throw in the crabs; when brown 
on one side, turn and brown on the other. Serve as above. 

CRAW-FISH 

These are found in most of our brooks and rivers. They 
resemble the lobster, and are often called young lobsters. 

They are boiled and served the same as crabs, or used 
to garnish boiled fish. 

SHRIMPS 

Of all fish belonging to the lobster species, shrimps are the 
smallest. They are of two kinds, the Gulf shrimps or 
prawns being the largest. They are sold by the quart, 
already boiled, in some markets, but in the Northern cities 
the canned goods are convenient and very nice. Those 
put up by Dunbar & Co., and White, are the best. 



FISH 61 

BOILED SHRIMPS 

Wash, and boil the same as crabs. When cold, twist the 
body and tail shells apart, carefully, so as not to break the 
meat, which remove in one piece. Serve same as crabs. 



SCALLOPS 

Scallops are always sold by measure, and only the muscular 
part of the fish is fit to use. 

TO FRY SCALLOPS 

Cover the scallops with boiling water and let them stand 
three minutes ; drain, and dry them with a towel ; season 
with salt and pepper, dip first in beaten egg, then in bread 
crumbs," and fry in boiling fat or oil. 

STEWED SCALLOPS 

i pint of scallops i pint of milk 

i tablespoon ful of butter i tablespoon ful of flour 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the scallops in cold water, then drain them. Put the 
milk on to boil. Rub 'the butter and flour together and 
add to the milk when boiling ; add the scallops, stir, and 
cook five minutes ; add salt and pepper, and serve. 



MUSSELS OR SOFT CLAMS 

Mussels are good during the winter months only. They 
should be of medium size, heavy, and perfectly fresh. Re- 
move the shells carefully ; wash the mussels and soak in 
cold water for ten or fifteen minutes, then drain. 

FRIED MUSSELS 
Mussels may be fried and served like oysters. 



62 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

STEWED MUSSELS 

Wash ; and open the mussels until you have one quart. 
Then put them into a hot pan and stew for five minutes; 
add two tablespoonfuls of butter, dust them with a table- 
spoonful of flour, add six whole pepper-corns and stew 
gently for ten minutes. Then add a half cupful of cream 
and the well-beaten yolks of two eggs. Take from the fire 
and season with pepper and salt. 



CLAMS 

There are two varieties of clams, the small sand or little 
necks, and the mud clams or quahaugs. The first are very 
much the best, and are in season almost the whole jear. 

FRIED CLAMS 
Clams may be fried the same as oysters. 

STEWED CLAMS 

Clams may be stewed the same as mussels, using fifty clams 
instead of one quart of mussels. 

TO ROAST CLAMS 

Wash them and put on a gridiron over the hot coals. 
When the shells open, remove the upper one, and serve in 
the under shell at once with a bit of butter and a little 
pepper on each. 

CLAM FRITTERS 

Clam fritters may be made the same as oyster fritters, using 
twenty-five clams instead of twenty-five oysters. 

PICKLED CLAMS 

Pickled clams are made precisely the same as pickled 
oysters, using fifty little-neck clams instead of fifty oysters. 



FISH 63 

TERRAPIN 

Terrapins are always sold alive, and are in season from 
November to March. Diamond backs are the best, but are 
very expensive, costing from thirty to thirty-six dollars per 
dozen for cows. The males are small and of inferior flavor. 
The common red-legs or fresh-water terrapin are very 
good, and only cost about two or three dollars a dozen for 
the very best. 

STEWED TERRAPIN 

2 terrapins ^ pound of butter 

y*, pint of thick cream i gill of sherry or Madeira 

6 eggs ^ teaspoon ful of mace 

Salt and cayenne to taste 

Put the- terrapins alive into boiling water, and boil ten or 
fifteen minutes, or until you can pull off the outer skin and 
the toe nails. Now put them back in fresh boiling water, 
add a heaping teaspoonful of salt and boil slowly until the 
shells part easily and the flesh on the legs is quite tender. 
When done take out, remove the under shell, and let stand 
until cool enough to handle. Then take them out of the 
upper shells ; carefully remove the sand bags, bladders, the 
thick heavy part of the intestines, and the gall sacks, which 
are found imbedded in one lobe of the liver, and throw 
them away. In removing the gall sack, be very careful not to 
break it, as it would spoil the whole terrapin. Break the 
terrapin into convenient-sized pieces, cut the small intes- 
tines into tiny pieces and add them to the meat ; now add 
the liver broken up, also all the eggs found in the terrapins. 
Now put it into a stewing-pan with the juice or liquor it 
has given out while being cut. Roll the butter in flour, 
add it to the terrapin, and stand on a very moderate fire 
until heated. Boil the six eggs for fifteen minutes, take 
out the yolks, mash to a smooth paste with two tablespoon- 



61 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

fuls of the wine, then add this, the cream and seasoning to 
the terrapin, let it boil up once, take from fire, add the 
wine and serve. 

It must never be boiled after adding the wine. More 
or less wine may be added according to taste. 

OYSTERS 

11 Blessed if I don't think that ven a man's iverry poor he ritshes 
out of his lodgings and eats oysters in regular desperation" PICKWICK 
PAPERS. 

Blue Points are nicest for serving raw, as they are small and 
fat and are considered the finest in the market. The Cape 
Shores, Maurice River Coves, and the Western Shores are 
all very good. They are in season from September until 
May and, like other shell-fish, are not good when dead. 

Dr. Kitchener says, "Those who wish to enjoy this 
delicious restorative in its utmost perfection, must eat it the 
moment it is opened, with its own gravy in the under 
shell ; if not eaten while absolutely alive, its flavor and 
spirit are lost." 

SERVED ON THE HALF SHELL 

Allow six oysters to each person. Wash the shells well ; 
open them carefully; take off the upper shell, detach the 
oyster from the under shell, but leave it there. Put six 
on an oyster or round plate, and serve with a piece of 
lemon in the centre of the dish. 

SERVED IN A BLOCK OF ICE 

Take a perfectly clear block of ice, weighing about ten 
pounds. Heat a flat-iron, and with it mark out the space 
to be melted, leaving a wall about an inch and a half 
thick. Reheat the iron and with it melt the ice in the 
centre of the block ; heat again, and continue the opera- 



FISH 65 

tion until you have a perfectly square cavity, leaving the 
bottom and sides about one and a half inches thick. 
Empty all the water carefully out, fill the cavity with 
freshly-opened oysters. Fold a napkin and place it on a 
large flat dish ; stand the ice on this, and garnish the dish 
with smilax and nasturtium flowers ; here and 'there, among 
the smilax, lemon quarters may be placed. 

In large cities, ice moulds of different varieties are 
frozen to order and furnished by caterers.

Drain the oysters, and put the liquor on to boil; as soon as 
it boils, skim all the white scum from the surface ; now add 
the milk, put back on the fire ; rub the butter and flour 
together and add to the milk as soon as it boils; stir until 
it begins to thicken, add the mace and allspice. Wash the 
oysters by pouring cold water over them in the colander, 
add these to the other ingredients and stir constantly until 
the oysters curl ; then add the salt and pepper. Do not 
allow them to boil, or the sauce will curdle, but be sure 
they are thoroughly heated, as nothing is , more objection- 
able than an uncooked oyster in a hot sauce.

FISH 67 

stir constantly until it boils; add the oysters; let it boil up 
once ; add salt and pepper, and serve. A half-dozen 
chopped mushrooms may be added, if liked. 

PANNED OYSTERS 

Put twenty-five oysters in a colander and wash by pouring 
cold water over them ; allow them to drain ten minutes ; 
do not save either the water or liquor. Put an iron frying- 
pan over a quick fire to heat ; as soon as it is hissing hot, 
throw in the oysters and shake and stir until they boil; then 
add salt, pepper, and a piece of butter the size of a large 
walnut. Serve in a hot dish immediately. 

These are very nice, retaining all the natural flavor of 
the oyster. 

BROILED OYSTERS (on the gridiron) 
Use nice fat oysters. Lay them out on a board, dry with 
a towel, season them with salt and cayenne on both sides. 
Have your gridiron hot ; test it by dropping on a drop of 
water ; if it hisses, it is ready. Stand the dish in a warm 
place; put in it a piece of butter. Now cover the grid- 
iron with the oysters ; as soon as browned on one side, 
turn and brown on the other. Put them in the heated 
dish, and serve at once. 

BROILED OYSTERS WITH BROWN SAUCE 

Drain the oysters in a colander. Take one pint of liquor 
to every twenty-five oysters ; put the liquor on to boil ; 
skim all scum from the surface. Put one tablespoonful of 
butter in a frying-pan, and stir until a nice brown ; then 
add two tablespoon fuls of flour, mix well, and brown ; then 
add the oyster liquor, and stir constantly until it boils. 
Season with salt and pepper, and stand it over hot water until 
wanted. Broil oysters on gridiron, as directed, throw 
them into this sauce, and serve on squares of buttered toast. 



68 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

NEW YORK BROILED OYSTERS 

Take twenty-five large oysters, drain them, and place on a 
a baking board, season with salt and cayenne, and dip in 
bread crumbs. Grease an oyster broiler, place the oysters 
in side by side, close the broiler, and broil them over a 
clear fire until brown on one side, then turn and brown 
the other. Serve immediately on squares of buttered 
toast, with a few drops of lemon and a bit of butter on 
each oyster. 

PHILADELPHIA BROILED OYSTERS 

Take twenty-five large oysters, drain them, and place on a 
baking board. Season them with salt and cayenne. Put one 
cup of the liquor on to boil ; as soon as it boils, skim it, and 
add one tablespoonful of butter, with salt and cayenne 
to taste. Grease an oyster broiler, place the oysters in 
side by side, close the broiler, and broil them over a clear 
fire until brown on one side, then turn and brown the 
other. Now throw them into the hot liquor. Serve imme- 
diately with a plate of buttered toast. 

BAKED OYSTERS 

Take nice large oysters in the shell. Wash and scrub 
the shells until free from sand. Now place them in a bak- 
ing-pan, put in a very quick oven (400 Fahr.), and bake 
until they open their shells. Now remove the upper shells, 
put a small bit of butter on each oyster, sprinkle lightly 
with salt and cayenne, and serve in the under shells. 

FRIED OYSTERS Philadelphia Style 
Select for frying the finest oysters you can get. Drain 
them in a colander, and dry one by one on an old napkin 
or soft linen. Do not lift them with a fork, but carefully 
with the fingers. Season on both sides with salt and 



FISH , 69 

cayenne. Beat up an egg in a saucer, add one tablespoon- 
ful of boiling water, and half a teaspoonful of salt. Put 
some nice stale bread crumbs out on your baking board, and 
season with salt and cayenne. Dip the oysters one by one 
first in the bread crumbs, then in the egg, and then place 
again in the crumbs, covering every part most carefully, 
and pressing it lightly with the hand. Put a deep frying- 
pan over the fire, with enough oil or lard to immerse the 
oysters. Be sure the oil or lard is boiling hot (365 Fahr.); 
if you have no thermometer, drop in a crumb of bread, if 
it browns quickly it is hot enough. Put in six of your 
oysters, watch them carefully, as soon as they are of a 
golden brown, take them out with a skimmer, and drain on 
a soft piece of brown paper, and serve at once on a hot 
dish. Some kind of pickles should always be served with 
them, in a separate dish. 

Oysters are very much better fried in oil than lard or 
butter. They should never be fried until you are quite 
ready to eat them, as they are not good when kept warm, 
or warmed over. If you have a large quantity to fry, they 
may be dipped an hour or two before serving time, and 
spread on a clean cloth in a cool place. Always use bread 
crumbs in preference to cracker crumbs. 

FRIED OYSTERS New York and Southern Style 
Drain the oysters and season as above, then dip them in 
very fine cracker crumbs or flour. Put three or four table- 
spoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan ; and, when hot, put in 
enough oysters to cover the bottom of the pan ; when 
brown on one side, turn and brown the other. See that 
they are crisp, but not burned. Serve at once on a hot dish. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS 

In a baking-dish put a layer of oysters, and cover them 
with a half-inch layer of stale bread crumbs ; dot this over 



70 ^ PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

with bits of butter, sprinkle with salt and pepper ; then add 
another layer of oysters, and so continue until the dish is 
full, always having the last layer crumbs, dotted with bits 
of butter. Moisten the whole with a half cupful of the 
oyster liquor and the same of milk. Bake in a rather quick 
oven for twenty minutes, or until a nice brown. Serve in 
the baking-dish. 

At my lectures I have often prepared these in the same 
manner, using the oyster shells instead of the one large 
baking-pan, allowing three oysters to each shell, and I 
think the flavor is thereby greatly improved. 

OYSTERS AND MACARONI 

Boil four ounces of macaroni, in plenty of boiling water, 
twenty minutes. Then cut it into pieces about one inch 
long. Put a layer of this in the bottom of a baking-dish, 
then a layer of oysters, sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and a few bits of butter, then another layer of maca- 
roni, and so on until all is used, having the top layer 
macaroni ; sprinkle the top lightly with grated cheese, and 
bake in a moderate oven twenty minutes. Serve in the 
dish in which they were baked. 

OYSTER SAUTE 

Enice fat oysters 
pound of Irish breakfast bacon 
'pper and flour 

Drain the oysters and dry them with a towel, then sprinkle 
with pepper, and roll them in flour. Put the bacon, cut 
into thin slices, in a frying-pan, and let all the fat try out 
of it ; then remove the bacon and cover the bottom of the 
pan with oysters ; as soon as crisp and brown on one side, 
turn and brown on the other. Serve on squares of buttered 
toast. 



FISH 71 

These are delicious. If no Irish bacon is at hand, use 
the ordinary smoked pork. 

OYSTER LOAF 

Cut a long loaf of bread into slices about two inches thick ; 
a baker's long five-cent loaf will make six. Now trim off 
the crust, and make each piece square. Dig the crumb out 
of the centre of each piece, leaving sides and bottom like 
a box ; that is, make a square box out of each slice of bread. 
Brush each box over with melted butter and put in a quick 
oven until a light brown. Fill with creamed oysters and 
serve. 

DEVILED OYSTERS 

25 nice fat oysters i tablespoonful of chopped 

y<2. pint of cream parsley 

1 tablespoonful of butter Yolks of two eggs 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour Salt and cayenne to taste 
Drain the oysters and chop them middling fine and drain 
again. Put the milk on to boil. Rub the butter and flour 
together and stir into the milk when boiling ; as soon as it 
thickens, take it from the fire and add all the other ingre- 
dients. Beat the yolks before adding them. Have the 
deep shells of the oysters washed perfectly clean, fill 
them with this mixture, sprinkle lightly with bread crumbs, 
put them in a baking-pan and brown in a quick oven for 
five minutes. Serve in the shells; garnish with parsley. 

They may be cooked in clam or silver scallop shells, 
but are much better done in their own shells, as there is a 
flavor imparted by the heated shell which greatly enriches 
the mixture. A word of caution : avoid long cooking, as 
it makes them dry. If your oven will not brown them in 
five or six minutes, and you have no salamander, heat your 
fire shovel red hot. Take the shells from the oven, hold 
the shovel over them until they brown. 



72 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

These may be prepared several hours before they are 
wanted, and placed in the oven and browned at serving 
time.

Put the oysters on to boil in their own liquor ; boil and 
stir constantly for five minutes. Take from the fire and 
drain. Chop the oysters very fine. Now put into a sauce- 
pan one gill of this liquor and the cream. Rub together the 
butter and flour ; add this and the oysters to the boiling 
liquor and cream, and stir until it boils and thickens ; now 
add the yolks of the eggs ; stir over the fire one minute ; 
take it off, add parsley, salt, cayenne and nutmeg, mix well, 
and turn out to cool. When cold, form into cylinders, roll 
first in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling 
oil or fat.

them. Chop them fine. Beat the eggs altogether until very 
light, add to them the milk, then the flour and salt, and 
beat until perfectly smooth; add the oysters (free from all 
liquor), and the baking powder ; mix well, and drop by 
spoonfuls in boiling oil or fat ; when browned on one side, 
turn and brown on the other. When done, take out with a 
skimmer, as it makes them very heavy to pierce them with 
a fork.

Put the oysters on to boil in their own liquor, drain, and 
save a half cupful of the liquor. Chop the oysters fine, 
add them to the half-cup of liquor and boil one min- 
ute ; then add the cream, the mushrooms, and the chicken 
chopped fine. Rub the butter and flour together and stir 
in this boiling mixture ; add the parsley, onion juice, salt 
and pepper, then the yolks of the eggs ; mix well and turn 
out to cool. When cold, roll into cylinders about an inch 
and a half long and about three-quarters of an inch in 
diameter. Cut the bacon into slices as thin as shavings, 
roll each cylinder in a slice of bacon, dip in French fritter 
batter, and fry in boiling fat. Serve immediately, garnished 
with parsley. 

PICKLED OYSTERS 

Boil fifty oysters in their own liquor until they begin to 
curl ; drain and save the liquor. Take a half pint of white- 
wine vinegar, and a half pint of the oyster liquor ; put them 
on to boil with two blades of mace, one dozen whole cloves, 
same of whole allspice, the same of whole pepper-corns and 
a dash of cayenne ; as soon as they come to a good, hard 
boil, have the oysters in a glass jar, pour over them the

MEATS 



As stated in the remarks on soup, the principal constituents 
of animal food are fibrin, fat, gelatin, albumen, and osma- 
zome. It also contains a large amount of water. Liebig 
assumes that 74 parts are water and 26 parts dry matter. 

" The ratio of water in meats, fowl and fish is quite 
uniform, ranging from 70 to 80 per cent., but the propor- 
tion of other constituents, muscular fibre, fat and bone, 
exhibits the widest possible diversity. In some animals, 
more especially wild ones, as deer, there may be hardly 
a trace of oily matter, while swine are often fed until 
the animal becomes one morbid and unwieldy mass of 
fat. The pure muscle of ordinary meat, with all its visible 
fat removed, is assumed by Liebig to still contain about 8 
per cent, of fat. In beef and mutton such as is met with 
in our markets, from a third to a fourth of the whole dead 
weight generally consists of fat." (Johnston.) 

In cooking meats our object is to retain the nourish- 
ment and flavor, consequently we must follow directions 
exactly the opposite from those for making soup. The 
flavor and juiciness of meat depend as much upon the method 
of cooking as upon the quality of the meat. If cold water 
and a moderate heat will soften the fibre and draw out the 
juices, boiling water or a strong, dry heat will retain them, 

(79) 



80 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

by coagulating the albumen on the surface and to a certain 
depth within, thus enclosing the meat in a water-proof case 
or crust, which neither permits the juices to flow out nor the 
water to penetrate within ; in this way only is meat juicy 
and well flavored. 

The more albumen the flesh contains the more tender 
it is, consequently veal, lamb, and spring chickens are more 
tender than beef, mutton, and fowl. The coagulation of 
the albumen throughout the meat gives it the white, dry 
appearance. The tender meats also have less flavor, as they 
contain very little or no osmazome. 

I emphatically say do not wash meats, as in this way 
they are robbed of a large proportion of their nutriment. 
The steaks or roasts freshly cut from the beef are certainly 
free from all objectionable matter ; the outer edges which 
the butcher has handled may be well wiped with a damp 
cloth and they are ready for use. 

Heat is generally applied to meat in four ways : boiling, 
baking, roasting, and braising. The first includes all stews 
and boiled meats; the second our ordinary baked beef, 
commonly called roasted in the oven ; the third, roasting 
before or under the fire, and broiling. Roasting means 
exposing one side of the meat to the fire and the other to 
the air, which is decidedly the best way of cooking large 
joints. But in these days of small kitchens and ranges, so 
few persons have space or accommodations for using a spit 
or even a tin kitchen (although the latter may be used be- 
fore any ordinary range) that almost every family " roasts " 
in the oven ; and this is by no means an inferior way if 
the oven be very hot at first, in order to form a crust upon 
the outer side, then slightly cooled, to prevent the crust 
from burning, and finished at a moderate heat. In this 
way the meat may be well done, and if properly basted will 



MEATS 81 

retain its juices. The fourth way is braising, which is neither 
boiling nor baking, but has the advantages of both. The 
meat is placed in a braising-pan (a pan with a close cover), 
surrounded by water, and baked in a hot oven. This is a 
very nice and economical way of cooking meat. 

"Reed's Roaster" is the best and most convenient 
pan that has come under my notice, being a close box with 
a door at the end ; thus enabling you to look at the meat 
without removing it from the oven, which is usually neces- 
sary with 'other pans. 

Meat loses, while cooking, a certain amount of its 
weight. It is estimated that moderately fat beef and mutton 
will lose about as follows : 

KOASTING BAKING BOILING 

4 Ibs. of beef will lose I ft). 5 oz. I ft). 3 oz. I ft). 

4 " " mutton " I " 6 " I " 4 " 14 oz. 

The foregoing table will show that boiling or stewing 
is the cheaper method of cooking meats, as the meat loses 
less of its weight, and you use the so-called inferior pieces. 
These pieces are rejected, as Mrs. Turner fitly says : " not 
because they are actually much inferior, but largely for the 
reason which induced the generation before ours to throw 
away shad-roe, sweet-breads, and other things now con- 
sidered luxuries." 

When we consider that a bullock weighing 800 pounds 
contains only 120 pounds of what are sought after in 
markets as the best pieces for roasts and steaks, and that 
only 8 to 1 2 pounds in the whole 800 are tenderloins, and 
when all dealers admit that the comparative cost of the tra- 
ditional best pieces is out of all proportion to their com- 
parative value as nutrition, we may well be tempted to tamper 
with our tradition and experiment a little with portions of 
the remaining 680 pounds ; and from these 680 pounds are 



82 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

made all our nicest dishes, such as ragouts, brown stews, 
pot-roasts, rolls, and in fact all the French made dishes. 

In the recipes for stews and their companions, you will 
notice that we never stew in plain water and thicken after- 
wards, but make a gravy first, either from salt pork fat, 
dripping, suet, or butter (never lard), and in this way the 
meat is more savory and rich. 

By changing the spices and flavorings, by browning, 
or not, the sauces, an endless number of dishes may be 
made from the few recipes given. 



BEEF 

The meat should be of fine grain, a clear red color, with a 
yellowish-white, firm fat. It is divided into fore and hind 
quarters. The hind quarter is divided into leg, loin and 
flank. The sirloin runs from the rib to the hip or pin 
bone ; the rump extends from this to the socket bone. 
The skirt steak is in the flank. The fore quarter is divided 
into ribs, shoulder, plate, brisket, chuck ribs, and shin. 
The standing ribs are six in number. The seventh and 
eighth ribs are called the first chuck, the ninth and tenth 
the second chuck, the eleventh and twelfth the third chuck, 
the thirteenth the fourth chuck. The bolar piece is the 
fleshy part of the shoulder. The plate is the top of the 
ribs, then comes the brisket. 

ROAST BEEF 

The best pieces for roasting are the ribs, sirloin, and pin 
bone. 

If you use a tin kitchen, run the spit through the 
meat, dredge it with pepper, and place it at first very near 
a hot fire. As soon as brown on the surface, draw a little 



ME A TS 83 

from the fire, that it may not burn ; put a half pint of water 
and one teaspoonful of salt in the bottom of the kitchen, 
and turn the meat almost constantly, basting every ten 
minutes until done. Roast fifteen minutes to every pound, 
if you like your meat rare ; if well done, twenty minutes. 
Do not add any more water after the first evaporates, 
as there will be sufficient fat falling into the kitchen to 
baste with. For the gravy, allow two tablespoon fuls of 
dripping to remain in the bottom of the kitchen ; add 
to it one tablespoonful of flour ; mix until smooth ; add 
a half pint of boiling water or stock ; stir continually until 
it boils ; then add salt and pepper to taste, and serve in a 
sauce-boat. 

BAKED BEEF OR ROASTED IN THE OVEN 

Place the joint in the bottom of a baking-pan, dredge it 
lightly with pepper; add one teaspoonful of salt to one 
cupful of water, and pour it in the pan. Place it in a very 
hot oven ; baste every ten minutes, lest it should burn. Turn 
it two or three times, and bake fifteen minutes to every 
pound. Serve with gravy made the same as for roast beef. 

BAKED RIB OF BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING 
Remove the ribs, then roll the meat, and tie it with twine 
(the butcher will do this if you ask him). Place it in a 
baking-pan, dredge it lightly with pepper; add one tea- 
spoonful of salt to one cupful of water, and pour it in the 
pan. Then place the pan in a very hot oven and baste 
often, lest it should burn. Bake fifteen minutes to every 
pound. One hour before the meat is done, make the 
pudding. Pour nearly all the dripping from under the 
meat into another baking-pan, and turn into it the pudding. 
Bake one hour. 



84 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

THE PUDDING 

3 eggs 6 large tablespoonfuls of flour 

i pint of milk ^ teaspoonful of salt 

2 dashes of pepper 

Beat the eggs, whites and yolks together, until light ; add 
to them the milk. Put the flour into a bowl, moisten it 
gradually with the eggs and milk ; beat until smooth ; strain 
through a fine sieve ; add the salt and pepper, and bake. 
Cut into squares, and serve around the meat. 

A POT ROAST 

Trim off the rough parts of a nice brisket of beef, place it 
in a kettle over a good fire ; brown on one side, then turn 
and brown on the other; then add one pint of boiling 
water, cover and cook slowly fifteen minutes to every 
pound. Add salt when the meat is half done. After the 
water evaporates add no more, as there should be fat enough 
to finish cooking the meat. Serve with Brown Sauce No. i, 
made from the fat in the pot. 

FILLET OF BEEF WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE 

The fillet is the tenderloin of beef. They weigh from three 
to eight pounds, and cost from sixty cents to one dollar per 
pound. Having no bone, this makes an economical as well 
as a very handsome dish. 

From a caterer, a small fillet costs from seven to eight 
dollars ; if prepared at home, about half that price. 

To prepare, first remove with a sharp knife every 
shred of the muscular covering on the one side of the fillet. 
Now cut larding pork (very fat salt pork) into tiny strips, 
and throw them into a bowl of ice water to harden. Place 
one strip into the slot end of the larding needle as far as it 
will go, thrust the needle into the meat, taking a stitch 



ME A TS 85 

across the top about one inch deep, push the needle through, 
place the finger lightly on the strip of pork and draw the 
needle out, leaving the pork exposed about quarter of an 
inch at each end of the stitch. Continue until you have a 
row of these lardoons (the H,ame given to these small 
strips) down the centre of the fillet about one inch apart. 
Into the bottom of a baking-pan put one small onion sliced, 
one small carrot sliced, a stalk of celery cut into small pieces, 
four cloves, and two bay leaves ; put the fillet in the pan 
on top of these, dredge with pepper, and spread thickly 
with butter ; add a teaspoonful of salt to a quarter of a cup 
of boiling water, and pour into the bottom of the pan. 
Bake in a quick oven (400 Fahr.) for thirty minutes, bast- 
ing four or five times. The shape is such that it takes thirty 
minutes to bake a fillet, no matter what its weight. When 
done, take out and place on a hot dish. Add to the pan 
one tablespoonful of butter, and brown, then add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; mix well; add one pint of stock 
or boiling water, stir continually until it boils, strain into a 
frying-pan, and add one pint of fresh stewed or canned 
mushrooms. Cook five minutes, take from the fire, add a 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, one tablespoonful of 
sherry, salt and pepper to taste ; pour it around the fillet and 
serve. 

BEEF ^a la MODE 

Take from a round of be'ef a slice about four inches thick, 
weighing seven or eight pounds. Remove the bone. Bind 
the beef into good shape with a piece of new muslin or 
broad tape, sewing the ends together tightly. Cut deep 
gashes into the meat one inch apart, being careful not to 
cut all the way through. Mix a teaspoonful of salt, half a 
teaspoonful of black pepper, same of cinnamon, quarter of 



86 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

a teaspoonful of mace, the same of cloves, and rub them 
into the meat on both sides, sprinkling a little in each gash. 
Cut fat salt pork into pieces the size of the gashes, put one 
piece in each gash. Add to one cup of stale grated bread a 
small onion and a tablespoonful of parsley chopped very 
fine, moisten with vinegar. Now work a small portion of 
this forcemeat into the slots, by the side of the pork. Mix 
three tablespoonfuls of vinegar with three of olive oil, and 
moisten well both sides of the meat ; let stand over night 
if possible. Then put two large tablespoonfuls of butter 
into a braising or baking-pan ; and when melted and hot, 
add one onion, one carrot and one turnip cut into slices; 
stir the whole until lightly browned, then add two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, two bay leaves, a sprig of parsley, 
and two quarts of boiling water or stock ; let the whole 
boil two minutes, then put in the beef, and one knuckle 
of veal well cracked. If in a braising-pan put on the 
cover ; if in a baking-pan, turn over it another pan to keep 
in the steam. Put in the oven and bake slowly for six 
hours; oven about 220 Fahr. When done, take out the 
meat and stand away to cool. Strain the liquor, add salt 
and pepper to taste, and turn into a square pan to harden. 
This will make a jelly of a bright amber color. Serve the 
meat cold with squares of this amber jelly around it. Gar- 
nish with small button radishes, cut into tulips, and parsley. 
Serve also in a separate dish sauce Tartare. 

In winter this will keep at least two weeks, and equally 
as long in summer, if kept in a cold, dry refrigerator. 



BROILED STEAK 

Trim the steak free from all suet. Put the meat plate to 
warm. Grease the broiler and put it to heat. See that the 
fire is clear and free from gas. Now put the steak in the hot 



ME A TS 87 

broiler and place it over the fire; turn constantly. It will 
take eight minutes to broil if the steak is three-quarters 
of an inch thick. When done, place it on the hot plate, 
dredge it with salt and pepper ; turn it and season the 
other side. Serve immediately. 

Never attempt to broil a tough steak ; if you should 
be so unfortunate as to buy one, use it for some made dish, 
as hacking or hammering bruises the meat, and allows all 
the juices to escape. 



BROILED FILLET 

Cut a fillet of beef into slices about an inch thick ; moisten 
them with melted butter or olive oil, and let stand for half 
an hour ; then place them on a broiler and broil over a 
quick fire five minutes, turning them two or three times. 
Place them on a hot plate, season with salt and pepper, 
pour tomato sauce around, and serve. 



BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED IN ONIONS 

Cut one dozen onions into slices ; fry a quarter-pound of 
salt pork or bacon until all the fat is tried out, then take 
out the crackling ; into this hot fat put the onions ; fry and 
stir for twenty minutes over a good fire ; then add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a dash of black pepper, and one cup of 
boiling water ; place over a more moderate fire to simmer 
for half an hour. By this time the water should have 
entirely evaporated, and the onions should be a nice brown. 
Have ready a broiled steak, place it in the pan with the 
onions, cover it over the top with some of them, and stand 
in the oven for five minutes ; then place the steak on a hot 
dish, heap the onions over and around, and serve. 



88 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

HAMBURG STEAKS 

One pound of steak from the upper side of the round ; 
chop it very fine, add to it a tablespoonful of onion juice, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and two dashes of black pepper ; 
mix well together. Moisten the hands in cold water, take 
two tablespoon fuls of this mixture and form with the 
hands into small round cakes or steaks. This quantity will 
make eight Hamburg steaks. Put two tablespoon fuls of 
butter into a frying-pan ; when hot, put in the steaks, fry 
brown on one side, turn and brown the other. Now place 
them on a hot dish, add a tablespoonful of flour to the 
butter remaining in the pan, mix until smooth, add a half- 
pint of boiling water, stir constantly until it boils; add 
salt and pepper to taste, and pour it over the steaks. 

Or they maybe broiled same as a plain steak, seasoned 
with salt and pepper, and spread with butter. 

TO PAN A BEEFSTEAK 

When there are no conveniences for broiling (and we never 
fry a steak), heat an iron pan very hot, put in the steak, 
turn it from side to side over a very hot fire for about fif- 
teen minutes. The steak should be about three-quarters of 
an inch in thickness. Serve on a hot plate, seasoned the 
same as broiled steak.

Spread this over the steak, which roll tightly, and tie with 
twine. Put it in a baking-pan with any pieces of suet that 
you may have trimmed off; add a half-cup of water, and 
bake in a quick oven for three-quarters of an hour. Serve 
with Brown Sauce, No. 2.

i cup of stale bread ^ teaspoonful of sweet mar- 

crumbs joram 

i tablespoon ful of chopped 5 mushrooms, chopped fine 
parsley ^ teaspoonful of salt 

2 dashes of pepper 

Have the steak cut very thin ; trim off all the fat and skin 
from the edges, and cut the steak into strips about three 
inches wide and five inches long ; mix the bread crumbs, 
parsley, sweet marjoram, mushrooms, salt and pepper; 
moisten with the butter melted. Put a layer of this 
forcemeat on the top of each strip, roll them up tightly, 
and tie with twine ; dredge each roll thickly with flour. 
Cut a quarter pound of salt pork into slices, put it into 
a frying-pan and try out all the fat ; then put in the 
olives (as these rolls are now called) and brown them 
on all sides ; then put them into a saucepan, add to the 
fat remaining in the pan two tablespoonfuls of flour, mix 
until smooth ; add one pint of stock or boiling water, and 
stir constantly until it boils, then pour into the saucepan 
over the olives; add a slice of onion, a sprig of parsley, and 
a bay leaf. Cover and simmer gently two hours. After 
they have been simmering one hour* add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. When done, place the olives on a hot dish, 
strain the sauce over and around them, and serve. 

This is a very good and economical dish, and may be 
made without the mushrooms.

pensive. 

GRENADINES OF BEEF 

Have a rump steak cut one inch thick, weighing about two 
pounds. With a sharp knife cut the tender portion into 
pieces the shape of a French chop. Lard thickly on one 
side. (See directions for larding.) Put two or three slices 
of fat pork into a frying-pan (the tender part of the larding 
pork will answer nicely for this), and try out all the fat, then 
put in the chops, brown quickly on one side, turn and brown 
the other. Place them on a heated dish, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper. Add a tablespoonful of flour to the fat 
remaining in the pan, stir until a nice brown, then add a 
half-pint of stock or water; stir constantly until it boils; 
add a half-teaspoon ful of salt, a teaspoonful of Worcester-

BOILING OR STEWING 

For boiling, stewing, or braising, inferior pieces of meat 
may be used and made into good, wholesome and sightly 
dishes. Points to be remembered : 

I. Be sure that the water is boiling when you pour it 
over the meat. 

II. Stand it on the back part of the fire, where it will 
just simmer, never boil, allowing forty-five minutes for 
every pound of meat. 

III. Add the salt when the meat is half done.

this over the meat and stand it away in an earthen vessel 
for twenty-four hours. Then put it, with all its juices, into 
a stewing-pan, cover with boiling water, add the onion and 
bay leaves, and simmer two hours. When done, take out 
the meat, and reduce the liquor by boiling to one pint. 
Put a tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan and brown.

Take a piece of the round, weighing four pounds. Tie it 
into a neat shape with strong muslin or tape, put it into a 
large stewing-pan, cover with boiling water ; stand over a 
moderate fire, skim carefully, and simmer forty-five minutes 
to every pound. When the meat is half done, add a large 
teaspoonful of salt and one carrot, one onion, and one 
turnip, sliced. Fifteen minutes before you dish it, add two 
sliced potatoes. When done, dish the meat. Rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter or suet and three tablespoonfuls 
of flour, stir them into the boiling stew ; season to taste, 
and serve in a tureen, reserving enough vegetables to gar- 
nish the meat.

STEW OF BEEF WITH DUMPLINGS 
Two pounds of lean beef from the under side of the round, 
or a shoulder piece. Cut it into pieces about an inch 
square ; dredge thickly with flour. Put two tablespoon fuls 
of dripping or butter into a frying-pan, place it on a good 
fire ; as soon as it is very hot, throw in the meat and shake 
or stir until all is nicely browned. Now skim it out and 
put it in a saucepan. Add one tablespoonful of flour to 
the dripping or butter remaining in the frying-pan, mix, 
then add one quart of boiling water; stir over the fire until 
it boils, then strain it over the meat ; add one small onion 
and a sprig of parsley. Cover the saucepan and let it 
simmer for *wo hours. When the meat is half done, add a 
teaspoon ful of salt and three dashes of black pepper. Now 
sift one pint of flour, add to it a heaping teaspoonful 
of baking powder, and sift again ; add a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of salt and just enough milk (a little over a gill) 
to make a soft dough. Do not work it much. Dip the 
dough by small spoonfuls, and place them over the top of 
the meat, cover quickly and let simmer ten minutes. Do not 
uncover the saucepan while the dumplings are cooking, or 
they will fall immediately. After you add the dumplings, the 
stew will scorch easily ; therefore move the kettle to a moder- 
ate part of the fire. Serve as soon as the dumplings are done.

BEEF CROQUETTES 

Make same as chicken croquettes, leaving out the sweet- 
breads, and using one pint of cold cooked beef instead of 
chicken. 

MEAT RISSOLES 

Make a plain hash (see recipe) and stand it out to cool. 
Roll out any'pieces of plain or puff paste left from pies or 
patties ; cut into cakes with a cutter five inches in diam- 
eter j place one tablespoonful of the hash a little on one 
side of the centre ; fold over the other side of the paste, 
'like a turnover ; press the edges tightly together, and so on 
until you have them all made. The recipe given will make 
two dozen. Place them in a baking-pan and bake in a 
quick oven fifteen minutes. Serve on a heated napkin, 
with Bechamel sauce in a boat. 

TO PICKLE BEEF 

The beef must be fresh killed. Wipe every piece with a 
dry towel until free from moisture. If the pieces are very 
large, gash them with a knife, here and there, to allow the 
brine to penetrate. To fifty pounds of meat allow one 



ME A TS 101 

and a half ounces of saltpetre, one and a half pounds of 
brown sugar, about nine or ten gallons of water, and 
sufficient Liverpool salt to make a brine. Mix the sugar, 
saltpetre and water together ; add the salt until the brine 
will float an egg or a potato. Have ready the meat in a 
tub or barrel, pour the brine upon it, skimming off what- 
ever may float. Cover well with a thick cloth, and watch 
it carefully for one week, skimming every day. The brine 
must cover the meat. If the quantity of water given is not 
sufficient, make more brine from salt and water, and add to 
it. In about two months, drain this brine off, throw it away, 
and cover with a new brine made the same as before. In 
this way your meat will keep the entire year perfectly sweet. 
It will be ready to use after it has been in pickle two weeks. 
The skimming is an important point, also the Liverpool 
salt. Tongues may be put in the same tub, one or two at 
a time, to remain four weeks before smoking. They require 
about one week's smoking. When done, wrap each tongue 
and sew tightly in coarse muslin ; then hang in a dark, 
cool place. 

TO CORN BEEF FOR DRYING (Grandmother's Recipe) 

Cut a round of beef into four pieces. Rub each piece 
lightly with salt on all sides, and let it stand one day be- 
fore corning. Make a brine from one tub of water, a half- 
pound of sugar, a teaspoon ful of powdered saltpetre, and 
salt until the brine will float an egg. Put the meat into 
this brine, and allow it to remain two weeks. Cover it 
carefully and look at it frequently. See that the brine 
covers the meat ; if not, make a little more from salt and 
water and add to it. At the end of the two weeks, take 
out the meat and hang it in a cool place, to dry. It may 
be smoked, but many think this destroys the flavor. 



102 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

The latter part of October, March or April are the 
best times for corning beef. If the weather is too warm, 
the meat will spoil before it dries ; if too cold, it will not 
take the salt well. 

This recipe will answer also for mutton hams. 

TO CORN BEEF FOR BOILING 

Wipe the meat carefully and rub hot salt into it until all 
disappears ; then add more salt and rub again, and so on 
until the meat will imbibe no more. Place it in a jar or 
crock, stand in a cold, dry cellar for one week, turning it 
every day, and it will be ready for use. 

This recipe is for small quantities of meat, to use as 
soon as corned. 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF 

Wash it well, and put it on to boil in cold water. Bring 
slowly to a simmer, and simmer thirty minutes to every 
pound. 

If the meat is to be served cold, allow it to cool in 
the liquor in which it was boiled. 

If for a hot dinner, you may boil with it cabbage, tur- 
nips and potatoes, allowing an hour and a half for the 
cabbage, one hour for turnips, and twenty minutes for the 
potatoes to cook. 

PRESSED CORNED BEEF 

Take six pounds of the brisket of beef, remove the bones 
and tie it tightly in a cloth. Put it in a kettle and cover 
with cold water. Simmer gently for five hours. When 
done, take it out, place it between two tin sheets or large 
plates, put a heavy weight upon it over night. Remove 
the cloth, and it is ready for use. 



ME A TS 103 

FRIZZLED BEEF 

Chip dried beef very thin. To every half-pound allow a 
large tablespoonful of butter, a half-pint of milk, and one 
tablespoonful of flour. Melt the butter in a frying-pan, 
then add the meat, and stir over the fire for about two min- 
utes, or until the butter begins to brown ; dredge in the 
flour, stir again, then add the milk and a little pepper, stir 
again until it boils, and serve immediately. 

FRICASSEE OF DRIED BEEF 

Cook the same as frizzled beef, but use two even table- 
spoonfuls of flour instead of one. Add the beaten yolks 
of two eggs just as you take it from the fire. 

Corned beef's liver may be cooked in the same way. 

DRIED BEEF RELISH 

This is a way to use up the hard, small ends of dried beef, 
that you cannot cut. 

Grate the meat, and, to every cupful, allow four table 
spoonfuls of cream, four eggs, well beaten, and a little 
pepper. Put the meat and cream into a stewing-pan ; 
when hot, add the eggs; stir until the mixture becomes 
thick. Serve immediately on squares of buttered toast. 

STEWED BEEF'S HEART 

Soak the heart three hours in cold water, remove the mus- 
cles from the inside, and take out every atom of blood. 
Make a forcemeat as follows : One cup of bread crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, half a teaspoonful of marjoram, half a teaspoon - 
ful of salt, and two dashes of black pepper ; mix, and stuff 
the heart. Tie it together with twine, and wrap tightly in 
a cloth, sewing the ends together so that the stuffing cannot 
possibly get out. Put it into a small stewpan with the 



104 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

point of the heart down, nearly cover with boiling water, 
and simmer until tender about three hours. When done, 
there should be about a pint of water in the stewpan. 
Remove the cloth and dish the heart. Put one tablespoon- 
ful of butter in the frying-pan, and when brown add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; mix well, and add the water in 
which the heart was boiled; stir constantly until it boils; 
add salt and pepper to taste. Take from the fire, and, if you 
use it, add four tablespoon fuls of sherry ; pour it over the 
heart, and serve very hot, as it chills quickly. Currant 
jelly should always be served with beef's heart. 

BAKED BEEF'S HEART 

Prepare the same as for stewed heart, remove the cloth, 
place the heart in a baking-pan, baste with melted butter, 
and brown in a quick oven. When done, place it on a 
heated dish. Put one tablespoonful of butter in the baking- 
pan, and, when brown, add two tablespoon fuls of flour, 
and a pint of the water in which the heart was stewed ; stir 
constantly until it boils, add salt and pepper to taste, and 
four tablespoonfuls of sherry. Pour it over the heart, and 
serve very hot. 

SPICED BEEF'S HEART 

Soak the heart three hours in cold water, remove the mus- 
cles from the inside and take out every atom of blood. 
Mix together one teaspoonful of allspice, a half-teaspoonful 
of cloves, a half-teaspoonful of cinnamon, a quarter-tea- 
spoonful of mace or nutmeg, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
and two dashes of black pepper. Put this mixture into 
the heart, rub a little on the outside, and stand in a 
cold place over night. In the morning, finish the same as 
a baked heart. Have all the spices finely ground. 



ME A TS 105 

HEART WITH VEAU STUFFING 

Soak and clean as in the preceding recipes. Make a filling 
as follows : One pound of uncooked veal, chopped fine, a 
quarter-pound of salt pork, chopped fine, or a quarter- 
pound of sausage-meat, two heaping tablespoonfuls of dried 
bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of onion juice, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a quarter-teaspoonful of black pepper, 
if you like, a dozen mushrooms, chopped fine, and one 
egg slightly beaten. Mix all these ingredients well together, 
and stuff the heart. Wrap tightly in a cloth and sew it. 
Stand it in a small saucepan, with the point down, cover 
with boiling water, and simmer slowly three hours; then take 
it out and remove the cloth. Bake in a quick oven one 
hour, basting every ten minutes with a little melted butter. 
Serve with a brown sauce, the same as baked heart. 

This is also a nice cold dish, cut in thin slices, using 
no sauce. 

STEWED KIDNEYS 

Be sure that the kidneys are perfectly fresh. Split them in 
halves ; trim off with a sharp-pointed knife, as carefully as 
possible, the sinews and fat that are inside. Now cut the 
kidneys into small pieces, put in a stewing-pan, cover with 
cold water, stand on a moderate fire, and bring almost to 
boiling point. Drain this water off, cover with fresh cold 
water, and heat again. Do this three times, each time 
being careful that it does not boil, or the kidney will be 
hard and tough. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a 
frying-pan, and stir until a nice brown ; then add one 
tablespoonful of flour and a half-pint of stock or boiling 
water. Stir constantly with a wooden spoon until it boils. 
Now add one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, one 
tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, salt and pepper, and 



106 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

the kidney. Stir agaia until the kidney is thoroughly 
heated ; take from the fire, add four tablespoon fuls of 
sherry, and serve immediately. 

KIDNEY SAUTE 

Split the kidney in halves lengthwise, and trim off, as care- 
fully as possible, every sinew and all the fat from the inside. 
Cut it into small pieces. Put two tablespoon fuls of butter 
into a frying-pan ; when melted, add one small onion cut 
into slices, and the kidney; stir with a wooden spoon, 
over a brisk fire, for about three minutes ; then add one 
tablespoonful of flour; stir again, then add one gill of 
stock or water, one gill of sherry ; salt and pepper to taste. 
Stir again about one minute, and serve immediately. 

KIDNEY Terrapin Style 

Prepare and cleanse the kidney the same as for stewing. 
Put one tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan ; when 
melted, add to it one tablespoonful of flour, mix, add a 
half-pint of milk, stir constantly until it boils ; add the 
kidney, salt and pepper to taste. Stir with a wooden 
spoon until the kidney is thoroughly heated. Take from 
the fire, add the yolk of one egg, two tablespoon fuls of 
sherry, and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. Serve 
immediately. Calf's liver may be dressed in the same 
way. 

TO CORN A BEEF'S LIVER 

Make a brine from two gallons of water, three-quarters of 
a pound of brown sugar, a half-ounce of saltpetre, and 
salt until the brine will float an egg. Pour it into a stone 
or earthen vessel. Wash and wipe a perfectly healthy 
beef's liver, put it into this brine, and allow it to remain 
for one week ; then take it out and hang it to dry in a cool 
place. When dry, chip and frizzle the same as dried beef. 
This is the nicest way of using beef's liver. 



ME A TS 107 

FRIED BEEF'S LIVER 

Cut the liver into slices about a quarter of an inch in thick- 
ness, pour boiling water over them ; let stand five minutes, 
then wipe them, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and flour. Put 
three or four slices of fat bacon in a frying-pan and try 
out all the fat ; then put in the liver ; fry on one side, then 
turn and fry on the other. Do not cook it long (about 
two minutes) or it will be hard, dry, and indigestible. 
When done, spread lightly with butter, and serve. 

It is also very nice served with maitre d' hotel butter. 

TRIPE 

Tripe is the large stomach of the ruminating animals, and 
is chiefly composed of fibrin, albumen, and water. It is 
nutritious and easily digested. 

To prepare. Scald the stomach with boiling water suf- 
ficiently to loosen the inside coating. If properly scalded, 
it will easily scrape off. Wash it well through several boil- 
ing waters, then put it into cold water and soak over night. 
Scrape again until white and clean. Place it in a stewpan, 
cover with cold water ; add one onion, a sprig of parsley, 
twelve whole cloves, and twelve pepper-corns. Simmer 
gently for six hours, and it is ready to use in any way. It 
is usually sold in cities cleaned, but not boiled. 

STEWED TRIPE 

Cut two pounds of boiled tripe (half honeycomb and half 
plain) into pieces about one and a half inches long and 
a half-inch wide. Cut two ounces of ham into dice, and 
put it in a stewpan, add a slice of onion, a sprig of parsley, 
and one bay leaf. Stir over the fire until brown, then add 
one tablespoonful of flour, mix, add one pint of milk. 
Stir constantly until it boils, then add the tripe, salt, and 



108 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

pepper, and let it stand over a very moderate fire for five 
minutes. Remove the onion, parsley, and bay leaf, and it 
is ready to serve. 

FRIED TRIPE 

It is better to give tripe its long boiling the day before you 
want it. Cut the tripe into pieces about the size of an 
oyster, sprinkle with salt and pepper, let stand ten minutes. 
Dip first in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs, and fry 
in boiling fat. Serve with sauce Tartare. 

It may also be dipped in French fritter batter and 
fried. Serve without sauce. 

BROILED TRIPE 

Cut boiled tripe into pieces about two inches square, season 
with salt and cayenne, baste lightly with melted butter, 
and broil until brown on one side, then turn and brown 
the other. Serve on a hot dish, with onion sauce in a 
boat. 

TRIPE WITH MUSHROOMS 

Cut two pounds of boiled tripe into pieces about one inch 
square. Cut a quarter-pound of salt bacon into slices, and 
try out all the fat ; take out the bacon and throw it away. 
Season the tripe with salt and pepper, and cover it with 
flour, then brown it on both sides in the hot bacon- fat. 
Take it carefully out of the fat and put it on a hot dish ; 
add one tablespoonful of flour to the fat remaining, mix, 
add a half-pint of stock or water, and a dozen mushrooms, 
chopped fine; stir until it boils. Then add one table- 
spoonful of vinegar ; salt and pepper to taste. Pour it over 
the tripe, and serve very hot. Sherry may be used instead 
of vinegar, if liked.

inch wide. Put all the other ingredients into a porcelain 
kettle to boil. Put the tripe in a glass or stone jar, pour 
the boiling vinegar over it, and stand away for forty-eight 
hours. It will keep two or three weeks. 

TONGUE 

TO BOIL SMOKED BEEF'S TONGUE 
Wash the tongue well, and soak it in cold water over night. 
In the morning put it into a kettle full of cold water, stand 
it over a very slow fire, and simmer gently for four hours, 
or until you can pierce it with a fork, and it will be per- 
fectly tender. If the water boils away, add more boiling 
water. When done, stand away to cool in the liquor in 
which it was boiled; when cold, remove the skin, begin- 
ning at the tip, and stripping it back, and it is ready to use. 



110 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

If you wish to serve it as a hot meat dish for dinner, 
take it out when done; skin, place on a heated platter, 
cover the root end with sprigs of parsley, and garnish the 
dish with black-currant jelly. Another very pretty way to 
serve cold boiled tongue, is to cut it in thin slices, 
arrange the slices around a large meat plate, each one over- 
lapping the other, with sauce Tartare in the centre of the 
dish. Make six button radishes into tulips (as directed), 
stand them at equal distances around the dish. Nastur- 
tium flowers may be placed between, with little bunches of 
water-cress.

MUTTON 

Mutton is usually divided into fore and hind quarters. The 
hind quarter is sub-divided into leg and loin, the fore 
quarter into shoulder, breast and neck. A saddle of mut- 
ton is two loins. Mutton is very much better if hung at 
least one week in cold weather, but three weeks will not 
hurt it. The flesh of good Southdown mutton should be a 
bright red color, the fat firm and white; and the fatter the 
mutton the better and more tender the lean parts. The 
leg, shoulder, and loin make nice roasting pieces. The 
breast and neck are used for soups and stews. The loins 
are also cut into loin and French chops.

BAKED LEG OF MUTTON 

Procure a nice well-hung leg of Southdown mutton weigh- 
ing not less than ten pounds. Wipe it with a damp towel, 
place in a baking-pan, dredge with pepper, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt to one cup of boiling water, and pour it 
into a pan. Now place the pan in a very hot oven, and baste 
every ten minutes, adding no more water after the first 
evaporates, as there will be sufficient fat for basting. Bake 
fifteen minutes to every pound. Decorate the bone with a 
quilling of white paper, and serve with brown sauce, the 
same as roast beef. To roast in the tin kitchen, proceed in 
the same manner as for roast beef. 

MUTTON Venison Style 

Take a hind quarter of a good four-year-old Southdown 
mutton. Wash it well, inside and out, with cider vinegar; 
do not wipe it, but hang in a cold, dry place, not in 
the cellar if you can possibly find another place, as the 
moisture of a cellar is very apt to spoil the meat. Sponge 
in this way every other day for one week. Then mix a quar- 
ter ounce each of white pepper and allspice together, and 
rub well into the meat. Do this two days in succession, 
and let it hang another week. When ready to use, sponge 
off the spices with vinegar, and wipe dry. Roast the same 
as a leg of mutton, adding to the sauce, just before you pour 
it into the boat, one tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, 
one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and if you use 
wine, four tablespoon fuls of sherry. Serve with red or 
black currant jelly in a separate dish. 

BOILED LEG OF MUTTON 

Wipe the leg with a damp towel. Dust a cloth thickly 
with flour, and wrap the leg up in it. Put it into a kettle, 
cover with boiling water, and simmer gently fifteen minutes 



114 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

to every pound; add a teaspoonful of salt when the leg is 
half done. When done, remove the towel carefully, gar- 
nish with parsley, trim the bone with quilled paper, and 
serve with caper sauce either in a sauce-boat or poured over 
the mutton. Save the liquor in which it was boiled for 
stock. 

BRAISED LEG OF MUTTON 

Wipe the leg with a damp towel. Slice one carrot, one 
onion, one turnip, in the bottom of a baking or braising 
pan, add also two bay leaves, one stalk of celery, four 
cloves, and a sprig of parsley. Place the leg on top these 
vegetables, add one quart of water or stock and one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Put on the lid, if a braising-pan ; if a 
baking-pan, cover with another pan. Put into a quick 
oven, and braise fifteen minutes to every pound. When 
done, take out on a heated dish. Put one large tablespoon- 
ful of butter in a frying-pan and stir over the fire until a nice 
brown ; then add two tablespoonful of flour, mix, and add 
one pint of the liquor from braising-pan ; stir constantly 
until it boils ; add one tablespoonful of Worcestershire 
sauce, one tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, salt and 
pepper to taste. Pour this over and around the leg. Serve 
currant jelly with it. 

SADDLE OF MUTTON 
( Baked or Roasted in the Oven ) 

Bake or roast the same as a leg, ten minutes to every pound 
of meat. 

SHOULDER OF MUTTON 

This maybe roasted plain, or have the bone taken out, and 
the space filled with a bread stuffing, the same as for poul- 
try. Bake fifteen minutes to every pound.

BROILED CHOPS 

Chops are broiled exactly the same as beefsteak, trimming 
off most of the fat before broiling. Serve plain with but- 
ter, pepper and salt, or with tomato sauce. 

French chops are broiled in the same manner, deco- 
rating the bones with paper quillings. 

BREADED CHOPS 

Broil French chops ten minutes, turning them very often. 
Take them from the broiler, baste with melted butter, sea- 
son with salt and pepper ; let them stand ten minutes. 
Then dip them in beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs, and 
fry in boiling fat. Fill the bottom of a meat dish with 
tomato sauce, slip the paper quillings over the end of the 
bones, and arrange the chops nicely in the sauce. Garnish 
with parsley, and serve very hot. 

BREADED CHOPS WITH PUREE OF POTATOES 

Broil and bread the chops as directed in preceding recipe. 
Have ready six boiled potatoes, mash them fine, add a half- 
cup of boiling cream, one teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of butter, and a dash or two of pepper ; beat 
over the fire until light. Place in the centre of a heated 
dish, stand the chops around it, trim each bone with paper 
quillings, and serve very hot. 

BROILED CHOPS WITH POTATO PUREE 

Broil French chops as directed. Put a tablespoonful of 
potato puff mixture on each chop, and place in a baking- 
pan. Brown in a quick oven, decorate the bones with 
papers, garnish with parsley and serve immediately, or the 
potato will fall.

SHEEP'S HEAD HASH 

Clean a sheep's head, according to directions for cleaning 
calf's head, then put it on to stew with the liver and heart 
well washed, add one onion, and simmer gently one and a 
half hours. When done, take out and stand away to cool. 
When cold, take all the meat from the head, chop it with 
the heart and liver very fine. Now put them into a stew- 
ing-pan, add one large tablespoonful of butter, and one 
pint of water, or liquor in which they were boiled, salt and 
pepper ; let stew up once, and serve with squares of toast 
around the dish. 

DRESSED SHEEP'S HEAD 

A sheep's head may be dressed the same as a calf's head, 
using two heads instead of one calf's head. 

SHEEP'S TONGUE 

Fresh sheep's tongues may be braised the same as beef's 
tongue, using one dozen for the recipe given. 

TO BOIL SALT OR SMOKED SHEEP'S TONGUES 

Wash one dozen sheep's tongues, and soak them over night 
in cold water. In the morning, put them in a kettle of 
cold water and bring them slowly to a boil ; skim all the 
scum from the top, and simmer two hours. When done,

dry. Cut the bacon into slices, and then into pieces the 
size of a half-kidney. Place one piece of kidney on a 
skewer, then a piece of bacon, then kidney, and so on, 
allowing about three pieces of bacon and two pieces of 
kidney to each skewer. Place them on a broiler, baste with 
the butter, and broil over a clear fire five minutes. Dust 
lightly with salt and pepper and serve on the skewers. 
These make a very nice breakfast relish. 

SHEEP KIDNEYS en BROCHETTE No. 2 

Cut six sheep's kidneys nearly through without dividing, 
take out the white veins, wash and scald the same as in 
preceding recipe. Wipe them dry, and baste them with 
melted butter. Run a small skewer through each kidney 
in such a way as to keep the halves partly open. Broil 
them over a clear fire for about five minutes, take them 
carefully from the skewers, dust them lightly with salt and 
pepper, fill the centres with Bearnnaise sauce, and serve 
immediately. 

LAMB 

Lamb, like mutton, should be of a bright red color with 
white fat. It is in season from April to September, but is 
best when two months old. It will not keep like mutton, 
and should be used at least within three days after killing. 
Like veal, it is unwholesome if not thoroughly cooked. 
The better way of cooking is to roast or bake it. The loin 
may be cut into chops and cooked the same as mutton 
chops. 

TO BAKE OR ROAST A QUARTER OF LAMB 

Wipe the meat with a damp towel, place it in a baking-pan, 
and dredge it with pepper. Put one teaspoonful of salt in 



122 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

the bottom of the pan, add one cup of water to baste with 
at first. When that evaporates, use its own drippings. 
Lamb must be basted every ten minutes and baked fifteen 
minutes to every pound, in a very hot oven. 

Mint sauce, green peas, and asparagus tips should be 
served with spring lamb. 



VEAL 

Veal is divided, the same as mutton, into fore and hind 
quarters; the fore quarter is sub-divided into loin, breast, 
shoulder, and neck ; the hind, into leg and loin. 

Chops are cut from the loin, and the leg is used for 
cutlets and fillets. The fillet is a solid piece cut from the 
leg, also called a cushion, and does not correspond with 
the fillet of beef. 

Do not buy veal that is too young, as it is not only 
unwholesome, but dangerous. It may be known by the 
small and tender bones ; the flesh has a bluish tinge and a 
soft, flabby appearance. A calf should not be killed until 
it is two months old, then the flesh is firm, with a pinkish 
tinge, and the bones are hard. 

The loin, shoulder, fillet, and breast are used for roast- 
ing. The knuckle, which is the lower part of the leg after 
'the cutlets are taken off, and the neck, are used for soups, 
stews and pies. 

ROAST LOIN OF VEAL 

Wipe the loin, place it in a baking-pan, dredge it with 
pepper, add a teaspoon ful of salt and cup of water to the 
pan, place in a very quick oven for fifteen minutes ; then 
cool the oven somewhat by closing the drafts, or lifting a 



ME A TS 123 

lid off the stove if necessary, and roast slowly fifteen min- 
utes for every pound of veal, basting frequently, at first 
with the water in the pan, and afterwards with its own gravy. 
Veal must be well done to be eatable. When done, make 
a gravy the same as roast beef. 

STUFFED BREAST OF VEAL 
FOR THE STUFFING 

i cup of bread crumbs ^ pound of salt pork 

i teaspoonful of sweet i teaspoonful of thyme 

marjoram i teaspoonful of salt 

2 dashes pepper 

Chop the pork very fine, add it and all the other ingredi- 
ents to the bread crumbs. Wipe a breast of veal with a 
damp towel; make long gashes between the ribs, and fill 
with this stuffing. Place it in a baking-pan, and roast and 
finish the same as the loin. 

ROAST SHOULDER OF VEAL 

Have the butcher remove the bone from the shoulder, fill 
the space from which the bone was taken with a stuffing 
made the same as for the breast ; pin the meat together 
with a skewer to prevent the stuffing from coming out, and 
roast the same as in preceding recipes. 

VEAt CUTLETS 

Have the cutlets as thin as possible. Dust with salt, pepper, 
and flour. Put a tablespoonful of dripping in a frying-pan, 
and, when very hot, put in the cutlets ; when brown on one 
side, turn and brown on the other; take out and place on 
a heated dish. Add a tablespoonful of flour to the fat 
remaining in the pan, mix, and stir until brown ; add a 
half-pint of water, stir until it boils, add salt and pepper to 
taste, pour over the cutlets, and serve. 



124 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

VEAL CUTLETS BREADED 

Have the cutlets as thin as possible, cover them with boiling 
water, let stand one minute, drain and wipe dry. Cut into 
pieces about two inches square. Dip first in beaten egg 
and then in bread crumbs. Put two tablespoon fuls of drip- 
ping in a frying-pan ; when hot, fry the cutlets first on 
one side and then on the other. Dish, and serve with 
brown gravy made according to preceding recipe or with 
maitre d' hotel butter. 

GRENADINES OF VEAL 

These are made the same as grenadines of beef. 

A BREAKFAST RELISH 

Cut a cutlet of veal into pieces about two inches square, 
and season with salt and pepper. Dip first into beaten egg, 
then into chopped mushrooms. Put two tablespoon fuls of 
butter in a frying-pan, and, when hot, fry the cutlets until 
brown. Make a brown sauce the same as for veal cutlets, 
pour over the squares, and serve. 

VEAL CROQUETTES 

Veal croquettes are made precisely the same as chicken 
croquettes, using chopped veal and leaving out the sweet- 
breads (calf's brains may be added in their place), and, if 
made carefully, good judges can scarcely discern the dif- 
ference. 

I remember upon one occasion my college class pre- 
pared a supper, from a limited sum of money, for the 
remainder of the students, numbering nearly two hundred. 
As our purse would not warrant chicken, and we must have 
croquettes, we used for them a leg of veal, boiled with one 
lonely chicken ; and the croquettes were pronounced excel- 
lent by all, one gentleman asking for one to take home to 
his wife, that she might taste a perfect chicken croquette.

Put the milk on to boil, add to it the bread crumbs ; stir 
constantly until it thickens ; then add the yolks, mustard, 
chopped parsley, cayenne and ham. Mix all together. 
Bone the breast, sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Now 
spread the mixture over the breast, roll it up and tie with 
twine ; then wrap it in a piece of cheese-cloth and sew 
tightly. Put in the bottom of a soup kettle the bones 
from the breast, the knuckle of veal, three quarts of cold 
water, the onion, bay leaves, cloves, celery, carrot, and 
blade of mace. Place it over a moderate fire, and bring 
it slowly to a boil. As soon as it boils, skim carefully, 
add a tablespoonful of salt, and then put in the breast 
of veal ; simmer for three hours, then take out the veal, 
remove the cloth, put it on a flat dish, and stand away 
to cool. Cover the gelatine with a half-cup of cold 
water, and let it soak one hour. Simmer the knuckle one 
hour longer after removing the veal, then add to it the 
gelatine strained through a sieve, and clarify the same as 
Bouillon. Season with salt and pepper, and put away to 
cool, but not harden. When cool, put a layer of the 
liquid in the bottom of a mould large enough to hold 
the veal, stand it on the ice, and, when hard, place the 
veal on top of it, and pour the remainder of the liquor in 
the mould. (There should be just enough to cover the 
veal.) Stand in a very cold place over night. When 
ready to serve, wipe the outside of the mould with a warm 
towel, place a meat dish over the top of the mould, turn it 
upside down, and remove the mould carefully, leaving the 
galantine in centre of dish. Garnish with parsley, and 
serve with sauce Tartare.

Wash the liver, then cover with boiling water, let it stand 
five minutes, then take it from the water and dry on a 
towel. Chop the liver, the veal and the ham (all un- 
cooked) very fine ; then add the sage, parsley, salt, black 
pepper, cayenne and the onion, grated. Mix well. Grease 
a plain mould well with butter ; press the meat tightly into 
the mould, cover, and boil or steam three hours. When 
you remove the lid, you will find the meat has shrunk, 
leaving a half-inch of space partly filled with liquid. Care- 
fully drain this liquid off, put it in a saucepan over the 
fire, add to it the gelatine (which should have been covered 
with cold water and soaked a half-hour) and sufficient 
water to fill the space and cover the cheese. Stir until the 
gelatine is dissolved ; add salt and pepper to taste, pour 
back into the mould around the cheese and stand away in 
a cold place. When cold, turn out of the mould ; garnish 
with slices of lemon and parsley, and it is ready to serve. 

If properly made, the meat should be encased in a 
jelly.

Have the butcher saw the top of the head, and take out the 
brains. Now wash the head well in cold water ; cover with 
clean cold water, and soak one hour ; then scald the nasal 
and throat passages with boiling water ; wash again in cold 
water, and see that the throat is perfectly free from any 
foreign matter. Put it on to boil with the onion, bay leaf, 
celery, cloves, salt and water, simmer gently till tender 
about three hours skimming carefully at the first boil. 
Remove the fibre from the brains, then put them into a 
small saucepan, cover with boiling water, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, and simmer gently for fifteen minutes; 
take them out, cut into small pieces with a silver knife, 
and stand aside until wanted. When the head is done, 
take it from the water, remove the tongue, skin and cut 
into slices. Cut the meat from the head carefully. Put 
it with tongue and brains in the centre of a heated meat- 
plate, and keep warm while preparing the sauce. Put one 
tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan to brown, add to it 
two even tablespoonfuls of flour ; mix until smooth ; then

fire, skim and simmer gently for one hour, then add one 
onion, one bay leaf, a sprig of parsley, four cloves and a 
blade of mace ; simmer for a half-hour longer. While this 
is cooking, clean the brains, remove all the membrane, and 
parboil them for fifteen minutes, then put them away to 
cool. When 'cold, cut into thick slices, dip first in egg and 
then in bread crumbs, and stand one side until wanted. 
When the calf's head is done, take it out carefully, skin the 
tongue, brush the head over with beaten egg, then sprinkle 
with crumbs and chopped parsley. Brown in a quick oven. 
Plunge the brains into boiling fat just long enough to 
brown. Serve one-half of the head at a time, garnished with 
parsley, slices of lemon and the brains around the dish.

a half-teaspoonful of salt, onion, bay leaf and parsley. 
Cover, and let simmer gently one hour. When done, dish 
the rolls, remove the strings. Strain the sauce over and 
around them. 

SWEETBREADS 

Calf's sweetbreads only should be used for food, and, as 
they spoil very quickly, they should be thrown in cold 
water the moment they come from the market ; after soak- 
ing one hour, trim them free from fat, lard or not, as you 
wish, put them into boiling water ; add a teaspoonful of 
salt, stand them over a very moderate fire, and parboil 
fifteen minutes ; then throw them into cold water for five 
minutes, remove carefully any skin or rough parts, and 
then put them in the coldest place you have until you are 
ready to cook them. In this way they will keep thirty or 
forty hours. Always parboil the sweetbreads in a porcelain 
.or granite saucepan, and use a silver knife in cutting, as 
they contain a peculiar phosphoric acid that acts upon iron 
or tin, entirely destroying their flavor.

142 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

PORK 

Pork is divided into leg, loin, chine, shoulder, spare-rib, 
middlings, head and feet. The best parts for roasting are 
the loin and leg. 

Pork in every form is unwholesome and indigestible, 
and should never be eaten by persons with weak digestion 
or by children, and should not be used by any one except 
in very cold weather. It should always be thoroughly 
cooked. 

To select : The lean must be fine-grained, and of a 
pale red color; the fat white, and the skin smooth and 
clear. If the flesh is soft, the fat a yellowish-white, and 
full of small kernels, reject it, as this is an indication of 
disease. 

SUCKING PIG (TO ROAST) 

TO PREPARE 

The pig should be four weeks old, and should be roasted 
the day after it is killed. In cities, pigs are usually sent 
from the butcher's prepared for the oven ; but if it should 
be your lot to receive one in its crude state, we will give 
these few directions to follow. Wash the pig well in cold 
water, and let it remain in the water ten minutes. Have 
ready a large pan of boiling water, plunge it in, hold it 
by the nose and shake it vigorously about, until you 
can pull the hairs out easily. Take it out, rub it with a 
very coarse crash towel, rubbing from the tail to the head ; 
then make a small opening in the belly, take out the 
entrails, and wash it thoroughly in cold water. Wipe it 
dry. Make a filling as follows : 

i cup of stale bread crumbs 

i heaping tablespoonful of chopped suet 

i tablespoonful of chopped parsley 



ME A TS 143 

i teaspoon ful of powdered sage 

i teaspoonful of salt 
i^ teaspoonful of black pepper 

i tablespoonful of onion juice 
Mix all the ingredients well together. 

Remove the hoofs at the first joint, leaving the skin 
long enough to pull over the bone. If you are not ready 
to bake at once give it a cold pack, /. e., roll it in a wet 
towel and put it one side until wanted. When ready, put 
the stuffing in, sew the opening together, truss the fore legs 
forward, and the hind feet also forward, under and close 
to the body. Now wipe the pig carefully with a clean, 
soft, dry cloth, and place a stone or cob in the mouth to 
keep it open. Rub it with melted butter ; dredge very 
lightly with flour, salt and pepper. Roast before a moderate 
fire, as it must be thoroughly done, or, if baked, the oven 
must be moderately hot. Baste it with a little salted hot 
water at first, and then with melted butter until there is 
sufficient dripping in the pan. Roast from two hours to 
two and a half. When the pig is about half done, brush it 
all over lightly with melted butter or pure olive oil. When 
done, place it on a dish with parsley all around ; remove 
the stone or cob from the mouth, and put in its place a 
small red apple. Serve as hot as possible with apple sauce. 

THE GRAVY 

Brown the pan in which the pig was roasted, add to it 
two tablespoon fuls of flour, and brown again ; add one 
pint of boiling water, let it boil up once, add salt and 
pepper to taste, take from the fire, add four tablespoonfuls 
of sherry, and serve in a boat. 

TO CARVE 

Cut off its head, separate it down the back in halves, 
remove the hams and shoulders, and separate the ribs. 
Sucking pig may also be stuffed with potato stuffing. 



144 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

ROAST LEG OF PORK 

A leg to be roasted should not weigh over about six or 
seven pounds. Score the skin with a sharp knife, in par- 
allel lines about a half-inch apart. Place it in a baking- 
pan, add a teaspoonful of salt and a half-cup of boiling 
water, and place it in a very hot oven, basting every five 
minutes for twenty minutes ; now take the drafts off your 
fire, and allow the leg to roast moderately, basting every 
ten minutes with its own gravy. Roast twenty-five minutes 
to every pound. Pork should never be served under- done. 
When done, dish and garnish with parsley. Serve apple 
sauce and horseradish with it. 

FOR THE GRAVY 

Allow two tablespoon fuls of fat to remain in the pan (pour 
the remainder in your dripping-pot), add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour and brown well ; add one pint of boiling water, 
stir constantly until it boils ; add salt and pepper to taste, 
a half-teaspoon ful of powdered sage, and a tablespoonful 
of tomato catsup ; strain, and serve in a boat. 

ROAST LOIN OF PORK 

The loin and shoulder may be roasted the same as a leg, 
roasting the loin twenty and the shoulder twenty-five min- 
utes to every pound. 

ROAST SPARE-RIB 

Put the spare-rib in a baking-pan ; dredge it lightly with 
pepper ; add a half-teaspoon ful of salt to a half-cup of 
boiling water, and pour in the bottom of the pan. Place 
in a quick oven for ten minutes ; baste with butter and 
cover with a piece of buttered letter paper. Roast twenty 
minutes to every pound, basting every ten minutes. Fifteen 
minutes before it is done, brush it well with melted butter, 



ME A TS 145 

and dust it with a half-teaspoonful of powdered sage and a 
little black pepper. When done, serve and make a gravy 
the same as for roast leg of pork. 

Spare-rib may be stuffed with a stuffing made of bread 
or mashed potatoes, the ribs cracked crosswise the entire 
length in two places, the stuffing placed in the centre, the 
two ends folded over, and tied. Roast as above. Serve 
with tomato sauce. 

PORK CHOPS 

Put a tablespoonful of dripping in a frying-pan to heat. 
Dust the chops with salt, pepper and flour ; fry in the hot 
dripping until a nice brown, and thoroughly done. It will 
take about twenty-five minutes. Dish. Pour nearly all 
the fat from the frying-pan into your dripping-pot, and to 
that remaining which should be about a tablespoonful 
add one tablespoonful of flour, and brown. Then add a 
half-pint of boiling water, let it boil up once, add salt and 
pepper to taste, and pour over the chops. 

Steaks and cutlets may be fried in the same manner. 

SOUSED PIG'S FEET 

Clean the feet and scrape them well. Soak them in cold 
water two or three hours, then wash and scrub well. Split 
the feet and crack in two or three places. Put them into 
a stewpan and just cover them with. cold water ; place over 
a moderate fire and simmer until tender. . Boil together for 
one minute a half-pint of good cider vinegar, three blades 
of mace, one dozen whole cloves, and two bay leaves. 
Season the feet with salt and pepper, pour into an earthen 
basin, and add the spiced vinegar while hot; then stand in 
a cold place. It will be ready for use the next day. 



146 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

PORK TENDERLOINS 

These are the tenderloins of the pork, torn out, and corre- 
spond with the fillet of beef. Two tenderloins will weigh 
about a pound and a quarter. Being solid meat, without a 
particle of waste, they are more economical, even at a higher 
price, than chops or steaks. They are best fried the same as 
pork chops. Before frying, split them lengthwise, making 
four pieces of the two tenderloins. 

PORK AND BEANS 

To every quart of the small white soup beans allow one 
pound of pickled pork. Soak the beans over night in cold 
water. In the morning wash them well in a colander. 
Put them on to boil in cold water ; at the first boil, drain 
this water off and cover them with fresh boiling water. 
Score the rind of the pork and put it in with the beans ; 
simmer gently until you can blow off the skin of the beans. 
To do this, take three or four beans in your hand, blow 
hard on them, and if the skin cracks they are done. When 
done, every bean should be perfectly whole. Take out the 
pork and drain. Put the beans into a bean-pot (an earthen 
pot or pipkin with a cover), almost bury the pork in the centre 
of the beans. Add one teaspoonful of salt to one pint of the 
water in which the beans were boiled, pour this into the pot, 
sprinkle with pepper. Pour over the top of the beans one 
large spoonful of molasses, put on the lid, then bake in a 
very moderate oven for six or eight hours. If wanted for 
Sunday morning breakfast, put them in the oven on Satur- 
day night, and let them bake all night. Serve with Boston 
brown bread. They may be baked in an ordinary iron 
baking-pan, but in that case they should be covered with 
another pan or carefully watched, and baked only two 
hours. Bring them to the table in the pan in which they 
were baked. 



ME A TS 147 

TO BOIL A HAM 

Wash the ham well in cold water. To do this thoroughly, 
you should use a small scrubbing-brush. Put it into a large 
boiler nearly filled with cold water, add a blade of mace, 
six cloves, and a bay leaf. Place it over a slow fire, that it 
may heat gradually. It should not come to boil for at least 
two hours. Then skim carefully, and simmer gently fifteen 
minutes to every pound, from the time it begins to simmer. 
When done, allow it to cool in the liquor in which it was 
boiled. Then remove the rind carefully without cutting 
the fat. Brush it over with beaten egg, and sprinkle with 
dried bread crumbs ; place in a quick oven for about fifteen 
minutes to brown. Serve it cold, garnished with parsley. 
Ornament the shank bone with a paper frill. 

OR/ TO SERVE HOT 

Remove the skin as soon as it is done, and, while yet hot, 
brush it over with beaten egg, sprinkle with dried bread 
crumbs, and put in the oven to brown and crisp. When 
brown, dish ; trim the shank bone with a frill of paper, 
garnish the edge of the dish with parsley and vegetable 
flowers, and serve with it asparagus, peas, or cauliflower. 

HAM BOILED IN CIDER 

Wash the ham as directed, cover it with cold water, and 
soak for twenty-four hours, then wipe dry. Put it in a 
porcelain-lined kettle, more than cover it with cider, and 
simmer gently fifteen minutes to every pound. When done, 
allow it to cool in the liquor in which it was boiled. When 
cold, remove the skin carefully, and with a dry cloth sop 
the fat to make it perfectly dry. Cut carrots and beets, 
that have been boiled tender, into fancy shapes, with vege- 
table cutters or a French knife, place them tastefully over 
the ham. Garnish with squares of aspic jelly, parsley, and 
olives. This is delicious. 



148 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

TO BAKE A HAM 

Wash a medium-sized ham as directed; soak it for twenty- 
four hours in cold water, changing the water three or four 
times. Now trim away the rusty parts from underneath, and 
wipe it dry. Make a thick paste with flour and water only ; 
cover the flesh side of the ham with this paste, place it in a 
baking-pan, the skin side down, and bake in a moderate 
oven twenty-five minutes for every pound, basting with 
sherry wine every ten minutes, until you have used a half- 
pint ; then baste with the dripping in the pan. When done, 
take off the crust carefully, and peel off the skin. Trim 
the shank bone with a frill of paper. With a dredging-box 
sprinkle the fat of the ham over with raspings of rolls or 
bread, and serve with champagne sauce. Garnish with 
pickled beets cut into fancy shapes, olives, and parsley. 

This is just as good as it sounds ; a little troublesome, 
but one is well paid. 

BROILED HAM 

Have your ham cut into slices about a half-inch thick, trim 
off the rind and rusty edge. Place on a broiler, and broil 
over or before a clear fire for eight minutes, turning two or 
three times. When done, spread very lightly with butter, 
dust with pepper, and serve at once on a heated dish. 

FRIED HAM 

Cut and trim the ham as for broiling. Heat a frying-pan, 
then put in the ham (use no fat), and fry over a quick fire 
ten minutes, or until the fat of the ham is a nice brown. 
Dish. Add one tablespoonful of flour to the fat remaining 
in the pan, and mix until smooth ; add a half-pint of milk, 
stir constantly until it boils ; add a dash of pepper ; pour 
it over the ham, and serve. 

Saratoga potatoes are a nice accompaniment to this. 



ME A TS 149 

BARBECUED HAM 
This is best done in a chafing-dish. 

Take one slice of cold boiled or baked ham, put it in 
your chafing-dish, season with pepper and a half-teaspoon- 
ful of French mustard ; pour over it one teaspoonful of 
vinegar ; heat quickly on one side, then turn and heat the 
other. Dust very lightly with powdered sugar, add four 
tablespoonfuls of sherry; boil up once, and serve on a 
heated dish. 

If you have no chafing-dish, this can be carefully done 
over the fire. 

HAM AND EGGS 

Fry the ham as directed in the recipe for Fried Ham ; when 
done, place on a heated dish ; allow six eggs to every slice 
of ham, have them ready, and drop one by one, into the 
the hot fat. Stand over a moderate part of the fire until 
yolks are set. Cut the ham into six nice pieces, trim the 
rough edges from the eggs, lift them carefully with an egg- 
slice, and lay one upon each piece of ham. Dust lightly 
with salt and pepper, and serve very hot. 

HAM CROQUETTES 

1 cup of finely-chopped cooked ham ' 

2 cups of mashed potatoes 
Yolks of three eggs 

i tablespoon ful of butter 

i dash of cayenne 

Mix with the hot mashed potatoes, the butter, yolks of two 
eggs, and the cayenne ; beat until smooth ; turn out to 
cool. Put the ham in a small frying-pan with the remain- 
ing yolk, and stir over the fire for about one minute ; turn 
it out to cool. When cool, take a large tablespoonful of 
the potato and form it into a hollow in the palm of your 
hand ; put into this hollow a large teaspoonful of the ham, 



150 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

fold the potato over it, and form it into a ball, making a 
potato ball with a ham centre. Dip these in beaten egg 
and then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling fat. 

HAM BALLS 

y?, cup of cold cooked ham 

1 gill of milk 

2 tablespoonfuls of dried bread crumbs 
i tablespoonful of chopped parsley 
Yolks of two eggs 

i dash of cayenne 
i^ teaspoonful of salt 
% teaspoonful of nutmeg 

Chop the ham very fine. Put the milk on to boil, add to 
it the crumbs, stir until it thickens ; add the yolks of the 
eggs, salt, cayenne, nutmeg, and ham; stir over the fire 
until thoroughly hot ; then add the parsley. Mix, and 
turn out to cool. When cold, form into balls about the 
size of a walnut, dip in egg and then in bread crumbs, and 
fry in boiling fat. 

These are used as a garnish to made dishes. 
This mixture, when turned out to cool, is a ham 
forcemeat. 

HAM SANDWICHES 

Cut the bread very thin, butter it lightly, put on it a good 
layer of finely-chopped cold boiled ham ; lay another piece 
of buttered bread on top, and press together gently. If 
the crust is at all hard, cut it off before putting in the ham. 

HAM AND EGGS SANDWICHES 

Mix the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs with one tablespoon- 
ful of French mustard to a smooth paste, then add one cup 
of finely-chopped cold boiled ham. Spread a good layer 
of this on a slice of buttered bread, cover with another 
slice, and press firmly together. 



ME A TS 151 

Or, spread a layer on one slice cut very thin, roll it 
up, and serve in a pile on a plate. 

Tongue sandwiches may be made by either of the 
preceding recipes, using cold boiled tongue instead of ham. 

BOILED BACON 
Bacon may be boiled the same as ham. 

FRIED BACON 

Cut it into very thin slices, put it in a frying-pan, and heat 
gradually for about two minutes; then fry until brown. 
Serve around a dish of fried potatoes. 

TO BOIL PICKLED PORK 

This is generally used boiled with sauer-kraut or cabbage, 
to give it flavor, a piece weighing two pounds being suffi- 
cient for one quart of sauer-kraut, or one head of cabbage. 
Boil two hours and a half. 

TO CURE HAMS AND SHOULDERS 

This should be done as soon as possible after the meat is cold. 
100 pounds of meat 2 ounces of powdered saltpetre 

4 pounds of fine salt 4 ounces of brown sugar 
Place the hams or shoulders on a board or table in the 
cellar, skin side down. Mix the salt, sugar and saltpetre 
well together ; rub the hams well all over with this mixture, 
and put a little in the hock end around the bone. Rub 
until they will take no more. If there should be any left, 
rub them again in about one week. Allow them to remain 
on the board for sixteen days. Then hang them up to 
smoke, with the hock end upwards, in a cool, dark, smoke- 
house. Keep up a good smoke from hickory chips, smoth- 
ered with sawdust, during the day, for two or three days, 
when they will be fit for use. One or two small hams may 
be smoked under a barrel. 



152 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

If you should want to keep the hams over until warm 
weather, our experience with the following method was 
very satisfactory. 

Examine the hams carefully, to see that the insects 
have not already deposited their eggs on the meat. Dust 
a little cayenne pepper around the bone, then wrap them 
closely in brown paper, then with coarse muslin to fit the 
ham exactly ; stitch tightly. Now give them a coat of 
whitewash, and hang them away in a cool, dark, dry place. 

Beef's tongues may be cured in the same manner. 

This recipe has been in constant use in our own family 
for years, and we pronounce it perfect. 



TO PICKLE PORK 

To fifty pounds of pork allow two pounds and a half of 
brown sugar, two ounces of saltpetre, and sufficient salt to 
make a brine with about nine gallons of water ; this de- 
pends upon the size of the vessel you pack it in. Mix the 
sugar and saltpetre with the water, and then gradually add 
the salt which should be Liverpool until the brine will 
float an egg. Pack the pork down in a half-barrel or tub, 
and pour the brine over it ; skim off carefully all scum that 
rises. Be sure that the pickle entirely covers the meat ; if 
it does not, make more brine from salt and water, and add 
to it. Place a board on top of the pork, on which put a 
heavy stone to keep it down. Examine carefully from day 
to day for at least one week, skimming off whatever may 
float on the top. In two weeks it will be ready for use, and 
will keep one year. It may be necessary to make an en- 
tirely new pickle in about two months, throwing away the 
old one. 

Pork should be pickled twenty-four hours after killing. 



ME A TS 153 

SAUSAGE 

15 pounds of lean meat 

4 tablespoon fuls of powdered sage 

5 pounds of fat meat 
5 ounces of salt 

2 ounces of pepper 
2 ounces of allspice 

Chop the meat very fine; this is best done with an "En- 
terprise Meat Chopper;" it takes but a moment, and the 
meat is not bruised or mashed as in a grinding machine. 
Now mix all the ingredients well together. Have ready 
the "casings," stuff with the meat, tie them into lengths, 
and put them away in a cool, dry place. If you wish to 
keep them for a time, twist them around in the bottom of 
a stone jar or a pan, cover with hot melted lard, and stand 
away to cool. These will keep one or two months. 

TO CLEAN THE CASINGS OR INTESTINES OF THE HOG 

Empty them, turn them inside out and wash them well. 
Soak them in salt water for two days. Now wash them 
again, cut into convenient lengths, and scrape them on a 
board with a blunt knife, first on one side, then on the 
other; when you have them well and carefully scraped, Wash 
again and tie up one end of each length, put a quill in the 
other end and blow them up ; if they are whole and clear 
they are clean, but if any thick spots are seen they must 
be scraped again. Now throw them into clean, cold, salt 
water until wanted. 

There is a small machine called a "sausage stuffcr," 
that is most convenient if you have large quantities of sau- 
sage to stuff. If you do not use the skin, simply pack the 
meat into small stone or earthen pots, cover with melted 
lard ; when cold, protect the tops with heavy brown paper 
tied down tightly, and stand away in a cool place. 



154 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

TO COOK IN THE SKINS 

Take the desired quantity, prick the skins here and there 
with a sharp fork (this prevents their bursting); place them 
in a frying-pan over a moderate fire, and fry in their own 
fat until a nice brown. When done, dish, add one table- 
spoonful of flour to the fat in the pan, mix, add one cup 
of milk, stir until it boils, pour over the sausage, and serve 
with buckwheat cakes. 

OUT OF THE SKINS 

Make into small cakes, dip into beaten egg and then into 
bread crumbs, and fry in hot fat. 

Or, make into small cakes, fry slowly in their own fat. 
Serve with cream gravy and buckwheat cakes as above. 

OXFORD SAUSAGE (Warne) 

i pound of lean veal i pound of young pork 

i pound of beef's suet y 2 pound of bread crumbs 

Grated peel of half a lemon i nutmeg, grated 
6 sage leaves, powdered i sprig of thyme 

i sprig of savory i sprig of marjoram 

Free the pork from skin and gristle, and chop it, the veal, 
and suet, all separately and as fine as possible ; then mix 
together, add the grated bread crumbs, lemon peel, nutmeg, 
a teaspoonful of pepper, and two of salt, and the sage, 
thyme, savory and marjoram, all chopped as fine as you can ; 
mix all thoroughly together, and press it down into a pre- 
pared skin. When you use them, fry them a fine brown in 
fresh butter. Serve as hot as possible. 

BOLOGNA SAUSAGE 

6 pounds of lean beef 3 pounds of lean pork 
i pound of salt pork i pound of beef's suet 

3 ounces of salt i ounce of white pepper 

i teaspoonful of cayenne i teaspoonful of ground mace 
i large onion, finely chopped 



ME A TS 155 

Chop the meat and suet separately very fine, then mix ; add 
all the seasoning, and mix thoroughly. Fill into casings 
(in cities you can buy these already cleaned from your 
butcher), tie them into lengths, or you may use strong linen 
bags. Make a brine, from Liverpool salt and water, that 
will bear an egg ; put the sausage into it, and let stand two 
weeks, turning, skimming, and watching carefully every 
day. At the end of the first week throw away the old, and 
make a new brine, then smoke for one week. If you have 
no smoke-house, this can be done under a barrel by simply 
building a smothered chip fire, hanging the sausages close 
to the head of the barrel, and standing the open end over 
the fire. When smoked, rub them over with olive oil, and 
hang them away in a cool, dry, dark place. If you wish 
to keep them for any time, sprinkle the outside with pepper. 
These may be either fried or boiled, served cold and cut in 
thin slices. 

SUMMER SAUSAGE 

4 pounds of lean beef 2 pounds of lean veal 

4 pounds of lean pork i pound of fat salt pork 

i pound of beef's suet y? ounce of powdered sage 
i grated nutmeg i chopped onion 

YZ teaspoonful of cayenne i teaspoonful of white pepper 
YZ teaspoonful of cloves, ^ teaspoonful of allspice, 

ground ground 

i teaspoonful of sweet i teaspoonful of thyme 

marjoram 4 tablespoon fuls of salt 

Chop the meat and suet separately, and then mix together; 
add all the other ingredients, and mix well. Pack into 
small strong muslin bags, making a sausage about the size 
of the large bolognas, and tie tightly. Place them in a 
kettle of boiling water and simmer gently for one and a 
half hours. Take them out and place them in the sun, on 
a clean towel, to dry. Then hang them in a cool place 



156 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

until next day. Dip them in melted lard, covering them 
all over, dust lightly with black pepper, and hang in a cold, 
dark, dry place until wanted. These will keep all summer. 
When wanted for use, draw the bag off wrong side out, and 
cut the sausage in thin slices. 

BREAKFAST SAUSAGE 

To those who are fond of a good breakfast sausage, and do 
not care to use that prepared by the butchers, I give the 
following recipe which is simple and as easily made as the 
ordinary Hamburg steaks: 

2 pounds of lean pork 

i teaspoonful of powdered sage leaves 

i teaspoonful of salt 

i saltspoon of black peppei 

Chop the meat very fine (an " Enterprise No. 10 chopper " 
does this quickly and neatly), add to it the salt, pepper, 
and sage ; mix thoroughly, and form into small cakes. Put 
an even tablespoonful of dripping in a frying-pan, and 
when hot cover the bottom of the pan with the sausage 
cakes; fry until nicely browned on one side, then turn and 
brown the other. Serve plain or with cream sauce. 

ONION JUICE FOR MEAT DISHES 

Take the outside skin from a large onion, and then trim 
off the bottom. Press the onion firmly against a large 
grater and quickly draw it up and down allowing the juice 
to drop from one corner of the grater. 



WHAT TO SAVE AND 
HOW TO USE IT 

" Waste no/, want not " 



Save all broken pieces and crusts of bread not fit for toast ; 
put them in a pan and dry (not brown) in a cool oven ; 
better leave the door open or you may forget them. When 
thoroughly dry, roll them on an old bread board, sift them 
through a rather coarse sieve ; the crumbs that easily pass 
through put in a box or jar, the ones remaining in the sieve 
turn out and roll over again and sift as before. These will 
be found very useful and much better* than cracker crumbs 
for dipping croquettes, oysters, etc. 

Pieces of stale bread may also be saved for bread 
cakes, queen pudding, or bread muffins. 

Muffins left from breakfast may be split into halves 
and toasted for luncheon. 

Broken pieces of buns and stale cake make delightful 
cabinet pudding, and are just the things for "general satis- 
faction." Here also you may use the small saucer of pre- 
serves left from tea. 

There is nothing better for panada than stale rusks 

toasted. 

(157) 



158 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

All cold mashed potatoes should be saved for cro- 
quettes or potato puff. One cupful will make six croquettes. 

Cold boiled potatoes make excellent French fried or 
Lyonnaise potatoes. 

All small pieces of plain or puff paste, trimmed from 
your pies or patties, may be used for cheese fingers or with 
the small piece of steak left from breakfast made into 
rissoles, and you will have an inexpensive but nice entree 
for luncheon. The unbaked portion of puff paste taken 
from the centre of patties, dried and rolled, furnish a richer 
and better covering for scallops, devils, etc., than the dried 
bread crumbs. 

If you are going to have celery for dinner, the green 
part of the stalks is not pretty in the glass nor crisp to eat, 
but is just the thing for stews, or flavoring for soups. The 
roots, when boiled, make an excellent salad. 

The turnip left from yesterday will be just eno\%h for 
to-day's soup, and will save the time of preparing and 
cooking another. 

Save every bone whether beef, mutton,- veal, ham, 
poultry or game as well as all juices left, for the stock- 
pot. Into this goes the long end of the rib roast, which 
would only become tasteless and dry if put in the oven ; 
also the fat ends of your French mutton chops. This pot 
is a store-house of wealth, not only for ordinary soup, or 
puree, but to use instead of water for sauces and gravies. 

The fat which you skim from the surface of this stock, 
every piece of suet from chops and steaks; in fact, all 
kinds of fat, should be saved, tried out, clarified, and then 
strained into your dripping-pot. If you do this religiously, 
even in a large family, you will have to buy very little or 
no lard for general frying. Doughnuts and fritters are 
much better fried in dripping than in lard, as they do not 
absorb so much of it. 



WHAT TO SAVE 159 

The coarse, tough and unprepossessing tops of the 
sirloin steaks, and the tough ends of the rumps, which 
cannot possibly be eaten when broiled, make most excel- 
lent, tender Hamburg steaks. If you are fond of 
these, and have much chopping to do, an "Enterprise" 
chopper soon pays for itself, as it saves time and chops 
uncooked meats. 

Pressed Meat No. i (see Index) is made from the soup 
meat ; remember, it is rather tasteless unless nicely sea- 
soned. 

Cecils are appetizing for breakfast or luncheon, and, 
unless wantonly suggested by you, it will never enter into 
the masculine intellect to suspect them of being the rem- 
nants of yesterday's roast. 

Cold mutton is better made over into pilaff, hash on 
toast with tomato sauce, and scallop, than when first served. 

Beef a la mode makes the very best of ragouts, and 
the pieces of game left from dinner are just the thing for a 
salmi, and there also is a chance to use some of the olives 
that were opened yesterday and will mould in a day or two 
if not used. 

Cold roast and boiled chicken or turkey may be made 
into croquettes, a la Bechamel, or a 1'Italienne; and, if 
nicely served, would never suggest warmed-over meats. 

A cup of cold, boiled rice added to griddle-cakes, 
muffins or waffles, makes them lighter and more easily 
digested. 

The water in which fresh tong'ue, mutton or chicken 
is boiled, may be used for soup or added to the stock-pot. 

After you have used all the ham that will cut nicely 
from the bone, and after chipping the remaining tender 
meat for frizzled ham, boil the bone with cabbage. Being 
free from fat, it flavors the cabbage nicely without making 
it greasy. 



160 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Whites of eggs, saved one or two at a time and kept 
in a cold place, may be used for angels' food, corn-starch 
cake, or apple snow ; the yolks for salad dressing, gravies 
or soups. 

Cold boiled, baked or broiled fish may be used for cro- 
quettes a la creme or salad. 

In fact, waste nothing, as many things may be re- 
dressed in a different way, and thus improve the appearance 
of your table without increasing the expense.

POULTRY AND GAME 



POULTRY 

In some markets poultry is bought ready dressed from the 
poulterer ; in others, picked but not drawn ; in others, 
again, alive. In case you should ^rneet with the latter, the 
best and quickest way of killing is by cutting the throat or 
tongue. Some cut the head entirely off. In either way 
they should be hung up by the feet without delay, as they 
then die much sooner, and bleed -more freely. Begin at 
once to pick them, taking a few feathers at a time, and 
giving them a quick jerk toward the tail. If you pull 
backward, it is apt to tear the skin. Do not scald them, 
as young chickens are completely spoiled by being thus 
blanched. It does not injure older ones so much if they 
are to be used immediately. After you have picked them, 
singe, by taking hold of the head and feet and passing them 
over the gas or blazing paper, backward and forward, turn- 
ing them on both sides, being careful not to burn the skin. 

TO CLEAN 

Cut off the head and feet at the first joint, split the skin on 
the back of the neck, then detach the skin from the neck 
and draw it down over the breast, and take out the crop 
without breaking it. Now, cut the neck off close to the 



166 PHILADELPHIA COOK tiOOK 

body. The skin is then left to cover the place where the 
neck was cut off. Turn the chicken around, make a vent 
under the rump large enough to draw the chicken easily. 
Take out all the internal organs the heart, liver, gizzard, 
lungs, entrails, and eggs, if there are any, being very care- 
ful not to break the gall-bag or entrails, as the contents of 
either would render the fowl uneatable unless thoroughly 
washed. And I will say, right here, never wash or soak 
poultry or game unless you have broken something ; then 
do it as quickly as possible, and wipe dry immediately. I 
cannot speak too strongly against this abominable practice. 
It may be, however, thoroughly washed before it is drawn, 
and if this operation be done as directed, will not require 
another bath. I was often puzzled to know why our so- 
called good cook books should recommend, "soak to draw 
out the blood " (and, of course, the flavor and nourish- 
ment at the same time), "and throw this water away," 
and perhaps on the next page will be found a recipe for 
beef tea, which will read : " Soak in cold water to draw 
out the nourishment, throw away the meat and save the 
water." This rule applies equally well to all meats. I 
wonder no longer after seeing the usual way of drawing 
poultry. In going from one house to another, giving 
private lessons to ladies in their own kitchens, I have 
more than once been shocked and almost sickened at 
the way in which this operation was performed. They 
first made a gash in the fowl large enough to insert 
the whole hand, at the same time cutting the intestines 
and dragging them one piece at a time had the whole 
chicken, their hand and arm covered with filth. Washing 
can never restore to a chicken thus drawn, its flavor. I 
would recommend it being thrown away at once, saving 
your digestive organs the trouble of digesting that from 
which you do not receive full nourishment. 



POULTRY AND GAME 167 

After drawing properly, wipe inside and out with a 
damp towel, remove the oil-sack from the top of the rump, 
and it is ready to use. 

TO CLEAN THE GIBLETS 

Cut the liver away from the gall-bag, being careful not to 
break it. Cut the heart open, and remove the clotted 
blood. Cut the outer coat of the gizzard, and draw it off, 
leaving the inner lining, containing the sand, unbroken. 
Wash thoroughly, and they are ready to use. t 

The giblets consist of the liver, heart, gizzard, and 
neck. 

Turkeys, geese, ducks, pigeons, pheasants, and all birds, 
are cleaned in the same manner. 

TO SELECT A CHICKEN 

Buy a chicken with firm flesh, yellow skin and legs. If 
young, the cock will have small spurs, and both cock and 
hen will have soft, smooth legs and tender skin ; the lower 
part of the breast bone will be cartilage, soft and pliable. 
If old, the opposites. 

Poultry full grown have the best flavor, and are good 
for roasting, fricassees, and stewing. Older ones make good 
soup or may be served boiled. Spring chickens should only 
be broiled or fried. Be sure that they are fresh, and free 
from any unpleasant odor. They should be drawn as soon 
as possible after they are killed, and hung away in a cool, 
dry place for at least twenty-four hours before cooking. If 
cooked as soon as killed, they are hard and tough. If 
frozen, they should be placed in a warm room to thaw 
several hours before they are wanted. 

ROAST CHICKEN WITH GIBLET SAUCE 
Procure a nice chicken one year old. Singe and clean as 
directed. Make a stuffing from one large cupful of stale bread 



168 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

crumbs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, a tablespoon ful 
of chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Fill the space 
from which you took the crop, sew up the slit in the skin, fold 
it over and fasten it on the back of the chicken with a small 
skewer; put the remainder of the stuffing in the body of the 
chicken ; do not pack it or the dressing will be heavy. Sew 
up the vent, place the chicken on a table with the breast up 
and the rump towards you ; push the legs up under the skin, 
cross them and fasten with a small skewer to the bone of 
the rump. Turn the wings back, run another small skewer 
through them and the body of the chicken. Now tie the legs 
together, wrap the twine around the end of the skewer and 
bring it up the back, wrap it around the ends of the wing 
skewer, and tie tightly. Put two slices of bacon in the 
bottom of a baking-pan, lay the chicken on them, cover 
the bottom of the pan with water, add a teaspoonful of 
salt, and bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes to every 
pound. Baste every ten minutes, first with the water, and 
afterwards with its own dripping. Fifteen minutes before 
the chicken is done, baste the breast of the chicken with 
melted butter, dredge thickly with flour, and put back in 
the oven to brown. When done, remove first the strings 
then the skewers, place on a hot dish and garnish with par- 
sley. 

TO MAKE THE SAUCE 

Put the giblets in a saucepan and cover with cold water, 
place on a moderate fire and let simmer as long as the 
chicken roasts. Then cut them fine. Add one tablespoon- 
ful of flour to the pan in which the chicken was roasted, 
stir over the fire until a nice brown, then add a half-pint 
of the liquor in which the giblets were boiled, stir con- 
stantly until it boils; now add the chopped giblets, season 
to taste, and serve in a boat. 



POULTRY AND GAME 169 

CHICKEN LARDED AND ROASTED 
Draw and clean as directed. Tie the legs and wings the 
same as for Roast Chicken. Lard the breast with small 
lardoons about an inch apart, making two rows on each 
side. Place the chicken in a baking-pan, put a tablespoon- 
ful of butter and a half-teaspoon ful of salt in the pan, place 
in a quick oven, and baste every ten minutes. Roast fifteen 
minutes to every pound if the chicken is young. Serve 
with brown sauce. 

CHICKEN STUFFED WITH CHESTNUTS 
Draw and clean the chicken as directed. Roast one quart 
of large chestnuts ; when done, remove the shells and 
mash. Put one-half the chestnuts in a bowl, add a table- 
spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of 
pepper, mix and fill the chicken the same as with bread 
crumbs. Lard the breast thickly with salt pork ; place 
the chicken in a baking-pan, add a half-cup of water and 
a half-teaspoon ful of salt ; roast in a quick oven fifteen 
minutes to each pound, basting every ten minutes. When 
done, dish, remove the strings and skewers, garnish with 
parsley. Put the remaining chestnuts in the pan in which 
the chicken was roasted, mix well, add a half-pint of stock, 
stir until it boils, add salt and pepper to taste, and serve in 
a boat. 

Chickens may also be stuffed with oyster or potato 
stuffing. 

BOILED CHICKEN 

For boiling, select a chicken over a year old, middling fat, 
and with dark yellow skin. Clean, stuff and truss the same 
as for roasting. Dredge it thickly with flour, put it in a 
pot with just water enough to cover, add a quarter-cup 
of washed rice. Cover the pot closely, and put it over a 



170 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

moderate fire to simmer until the chicken is very tender 
about two hours if the chicken is old. When done, remove 
the strings and skewers, serve with egg or oyster sauce. 

The water in which the chicken was boiled may be used 
for soup. 

TO BRAISE A CHICKEN 

i young chicken ^ small carrot 

i onion i pint of stock 

i sprig of parsley 4 cloves 

i bay leaf 12 mushrooms 

i gill of sherry, if you use wine 

Draw and singe the chicken as directed. Truss it without 
filling. Place the carrot and onion sliced in the bottom of 
a baking or braising-pan, add the cloves and parsley, and 
place the chicken on top; add the stock, a teaspoon ful of 
salt and a little black pepper; cover the pan, and place in a 
quick oven for one and a half hours,- basting every fifteen 
minutes. Then dish the fowl. Put a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in a frying-pan, let it melt and brown ; then add a 
tablespoonful of flour, mix, add the liquor from the pan in 
which the chicken was braised, and then the mushrooms, 
chopped fine. Stir continually until it boils. Take it 
from the fire, season to taste, add the wine if used, and 
pour it around the chicken. 

SMOTHERED CHICKEN 

Singe a young chicken and split it down the back. Take 
out the intestines. Wipe it with a damp towel. Lay the 
the chicken, with inside downwards, in a baking-pan, 
breaking the breast-bone to make it lie flat. Spread the 
breast with a quarter-pound of butter, dredge with pepper. 
Put a teaspoonful of salt and a half-cup of water in the 
bottom of the baking-pan, place it in a hot oven, cover 
with another pan, let it bake for half an hour, basting every 



POULTRY AND GAME 171 

ten minutes. Now remove the upper pan, turn the chicken, 
baste it well on the inside, cover again, and bake for another 
half-hour. When done, place it on a hot dish ; put the pan 
in which the chicken was cooked on top of the fire to 
brown, add one tablespoonful of flour, and stir until smooth 
and brown, then add a half-pint of milk, and stir constantly 
until it boils. Taste to see if properly seasoned ; if not, 
add salt and pepper. Serve in a boat. 

A BROWN FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN 

Draw and singe the chicken as directed. Cut it into eleven 
pieces. First take off the legs with second joints, then 
separate the second joints from the leg, making four pieces; 
take off the wings. Now cut through the ribs on either 
side, unjoint the back and breast, cut the breast in half 
lengthwise, making two nice pieces ; unjoint the back, and 
make two pieces of lower back. Place a quarter-pound of 
salt pork or two ounces of butter in a saucepan ; when a nice 
brown, put in the chicken. Stir until every piece is nicely 
browned, then add two tablespoon fuls of flour; stir again, 
add one pint of boiling water or stock, stir until it boils ; 
add a teaspoonful of salt. Cover, and let simmer gently 
until tender, then add a teaspoonful of onion juice, and a 
little black pepper. Dish. Put the neck-piece, heart, 
liver, gizzard, and the back pieces in the centre of the 
dish ; put the two pieces of breast on top, the second joints 
on one side of the plate, the legs crossed on the other, and 
a wing at each end of the plate. Pour the sauce over, 
sprinkle with chopped parsley, and serve. 

A WHITE FRICASSEE OF CHICKEN 

Clean and cut the same as for a Brown Fricassee. Clean 
the giblets. Now put the whole in a stewing- pan, partly 



172 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

cover with boiling water, set over a moderate fire, and sim- 
mer until tender (about an hour and a quarter if the chicken 
is young). When the chicken is done, there should be no 
water left; if there is, remove the lid, and allow it to evapo- 
rate quickly. Dish the chicken same as before. Put one 
large tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan; and when 
melted, add two tablespoon fuls of flour; mix well, but do 
not brown. Now add one pint of milk, turn the whole into 
the stewpan in which the chicken was boiled, and stir con- 
tinually until it boils ; add salt and pepper to taste, take it 
from the fire, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, pour it over 
the chicken, sprinkle with a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, and serve with rice croquettes. Do not boil after 
adding the eggs, or the sauce will curdle. 

STEWED CHICKEN 

Clean and cut the chicken as for Brown Fricassee. Put it 
in a stewpan, partly cover with boiling water, and simmer 
gently until tender (a young chicken about an hour and a 
quarter, an old one two hours to two and a half). When 
about half done, add a teaspoonful of salt. When the 
chicken is done, dish it as directed for a fricassee. Moisten 
two tablespoonfuls of flour with a little cold water, stir it 
into the liquor in which the chicken was boiled ; then stir 
continually until it boils, add salt and pepper to taste and 
a half-cup of good cream. Take it from the fire, add the 
beaten yolk of an egg, pour it over the chicken, and serve. 

CHICKEN au SUPREME 

This is a white fricassee made from the breasts of chickens 
only. Take a pair of chickens, clean as directed ; detach 
the flesh from each side of the breast bone carefully in two 
long pieces, called fillets. In two chickens you will have 



POULTRY AND GAME 173 

four pieces. Cut the remainder of the chicken as you 
would for a fricassee, put it in a saucepan and nearly cover 
with cold water; add one small onion, sliced, one bay leaf, 
four cloves, and a blade of mace. Cover, and bring slowly 
to a boil. Now place the fillets carefully over the top of this, 
and simmer gently until tender (about one hour), sprinkling 
them with salt, when half done. When done, dish the 
fillets tastefully, and stand in a warm place while you make 
the sauce. 

THE SAUCE 

Put one large tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan to 
melt, then add one tablespoonful of flour. Mix until 
smooth; add a half-pint of the liquor in which the chickens 
were cooked, stir continually until it boils, then add salt 
and pepper to taste, and take from the fire; add one table- 
spoonful of cream, the yolks of two eggs, and a tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley. Pour over the fillets, and serve. 

This may be served plain, with truffles, mushrooms, or 
a border of rice. 

The dark meat may be used for croquettes, cecils, 
Italian chicken, or chicken terrapin. 



CHICKEN a la MARENGO 

Clean and cut up a young chicken as for fricassee. Put two 
tablespoon fuls of olive oil in a frying- pan and place it over 
a good fire; when hot, put in the chicken, and turn and 
cook until every piece is nicely browned, then add a sprig 
of parsley, a bay leaf, one slice of onion, a half-teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a quarter-teaspoonful of black pepper, and five 
mushrooms chopped fine. Stand over a more moderate 
heat, and cook slowly until tender (about three quarters of 
an hour). Dish, and serve with cream sauce.

PILAFF OF CHICKEN 

i four-pound chicken 
y<2. cup of rice 

i teaspoon ful of salt 

Clean and cut the chicken the same as for a fricassee. Put 
it in a stewpan, half cover it with boiling water, and set it 
on a moderate fire to simmer. Now wash the rice, add it 
to the chicken, also the salt, and let all simmer until the 
chicken is tender. Make a tomato sauce. Dish the chicken 
and rice together, and pour over it the tomato sauce. 

This dish is very nice made from cold pieces of chicken 
or mutton. 

You may also use macaroni instead of rice. 

BRUNSWICK STEW (Mrs. Cobb, of Richmond, Va.) 

i chicken (four pounds) i quart of tomatoes 

4 medium-sized potatoes i pint of very tender Lima 

i pint of grated corn beans 

*/z pound of lean ham i large onion 

i tablespoonful of chopped ^ pound of butter 

parsley 3 quarts of boiling water 

Salt, cayenne and black pepper to taste 

Draw, singe, and cut up the chicken as for a fricassee. Put 
it in a large saucepan with the boiling water, the onion 
sliced and ham cut into dice. Cover the saucepan and 
simmer gently for one and a half hours. Then add the 
salt, the tomatoes peeled and sliced, the potatoes pared and 
cut into quarters, the corn, beans, parsley, cayenne and black 
pepper. Cover again and simmer one hour longer ; then 
add the butter cut into bits and rolled in flour** stir five 
minutes over the fire, and serve. 

Great care must be taken or the stew will scorch. 
Keep it over a very moderate fire, and stir frequently from 
the bottom of the saucepan. 



POULTRY AND GAME 175 

This stew, if carefully prepared, is most delicious. It 
may be made in winter from the canned vegetables ; but, of 
course, is not so good. 

CURRY OF CHICKEN 

Clean and cut the chicken the same as for a fricassee. Put 
two ounces of butter into a frying-pan. Cut one small 
onion into slices, add it, with the chicken, to the butter, and 
fry until a golden brown ; then skim the chicken out of 
the pan, carefully put it in a stewing-pan and 'partly cover 
with boiling water, add a half-teaspoonful of salt, and 
simmer gently until the chicken is tender (about one hour). 
When done, add to it a teaspoon ful of sugar and the juice 
of half a lemon. Mix one even tablespoonful of curry 
powder and one of flour, with a little cold water, 4o a 
smooth paste, and add it to the chicken. Stir continually 
until it boils. Serve with boiled rice heaped around it ; 
or, a teaspoonful of curry powder may be added to a white 
fricassee or a plain stew. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Clean and cut the chicken the same as for a fricassee. Dredge 
each piece thickly with salt, pepper and flour. Put three 
tablespoon fuls of oil or lard in a frying-pan ; and when 
very hot, put in the chicken, and fry slowly until it is done. 
If young (as it should be), it will fry in three-quarters of 
an hour. Watch it carefully that it may not burn. When 
done, arrange the pieces on a hot dish. Pour all the fat, 
but about one tablespoonful, from the frying-pan; then 
add a tablespoonful of flour, mix and add a half-pint of 
milk or cream, stir, season with salt and pepper, and pour 
over the chicken. 



176 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

SPRING CHICKENS (TO BROIL) 

Singe, take off the head and feet, and split the chicken 
down the back ; take out the internals, wipe the chicken, 
inside and out ; with a mallet break the breast -bone. Dust 
the chicken on the inside with salt and pepper ; place it on a 
broiler with inside downward or next to the fire. Broil 
over a slow fire three-quarters of an hour, keeping a plate 
turned over it all the time. Just before it is done, turn it 
and brown the skin side. When done, place on a heated 
dish, baste with melted butter, and season with salt and 
pepper. 

Spring chickens may also be fried or smothered. 

CHICKEN a la TARTARE 

Take a spring chicken, split it down the back as directed. 
Placfe it in a baking-pan, spread it thickly with butter, dust 
with salt and pepper, sprinkle with a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley and the same of chopped onion. Cover 
the pan, place in a quick oven for three-quarters of an 
hour. Then take it from the pan, brush it over with beaten 
egg, strew with bread crumbs, and broil over a gentle fire 
until a nice brown. Serve with sauce Tartare. 

CHICKEN CHOPS 

FOR THE FORCEMEAT 

White meat of one chicken i gill of milk 
i gill of bread crumbs i tablespoonful of chopped 

Yolk of one egg parsley 

Salt and pepper 

FOR THE CHOPS 

Dark meat of one chicken i onion 
i bay leaf y 2 box of gelatine 

Yolk of one egg 2 large tablespoonfuls of 

i tablespoonful of butter flour 

Salt and cayenne 



PO UL TR V AND GAME 177 

Put the dark meat in a saucepan, just cover it with boiling 
water, add the onion and bay leaf, and let it simmer slowly 
until the chicken is tender (about one hour). Cover the 
gelatine with a half-cup of cold water, and let it soak while 
the chicken is stewing. As soon as the chicken is tender, 
take the meat from the bones and chop it very fine. Put 
the butter into a frying-pan ; and, when melted, add the 
flour, mix until smooth, and then add a half-pint of the 
liquor in which the chicken was boiled; stir constantly 
until it boils and thickens, then add the gelatine, the yolk 
of the egg, salt and cayenne to taste ; mix well, and turn 
into a shallow pan, having the mixture about a half-inch 
thick. Stand away on the ice to harden. 

Now prepare the forcemeat. Chop the uncooked white 
meat of the chicken very fine. Put the milk on to boil, 
add to it the crumbs, stir until it thickens ; add to it the 
chopped chicken, parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash 
of cayenne. Mix all well together, take from the fire, add 
the yolk of the egg, and turn out to cool. 

When the chop mixture is cold, cut it into chop-shaped 
pieces with a knife ; cut as closely as possible, wasting none 
of the mixture. Lift each chop carefully from the pan, 
and cover every part with a thin layer of the forcemeat. 
Stand them on the ice for fifteen minutes, then dip them 
in beaten egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry them in boil- 
ing oil or fat. Serve with cream sauce. 

CHICKEN CUTLETS 

Draw and singe a young chicken as directed. Cut the skin 
and draw it entirely off of the breast. Take off the wings 
at the second or middle joint, not the one nearest the body. 
Now run a sharp knife along the breast-bone, removing one- 
half the breast in one solid piece with the first joint of the 



178 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

wing, thus making a chop or cutlet of one-half the breast 
with the first joint of the wing bone as a handle. Remove 
the other side in the same way. One chicken will only make 
two cutlets. The dark meat may be used for croquettes or 
other dishes. Put the dark meat in a stewpan and nearly 
cover with boiling water; add a small onion, a bay leaf, four 
cloves and a sprig of parsley ; place the cutlets in good shape 
on top of this, cover, and let simmer gently until tender 
this can be told by piercing with a fork. When done, take 
out the cutlets, dust them with salt and pepper, and baste 
with a tablespoonful of melted butter. Stand the dark meat 
away until wanted. Let the cutlets stand until cold, or 
until you are ready to use them. Then dip them first in 
egg and then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling fat until 
a golden brown. Trim the bones with a frill of paper, 
arrange the cutlets around the outside of a meat dish, fill 
the centre with cream sauce, and serve. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES 

i four-pound chicken i pair of sweetbreads 
i small onion 4 whole cloves 

i bay leaf i sprig of parsley 

Clean and singe the chicken as directed. Put it on to cook 
in boiling water ; add the onion, bay leaf, cloves and par- 
sley. Cover and simmer gently until the meat is very ten- 
der. While this is cooking, prepare the sweetbreads. Trim 
all the fat and pipes off, wash well in cold water, and soak 
for fifteen minutes; drain, cover with boiling water, add 
one teaspoonful of salt, and stand over a very moderate 
fire for twenty minutes. Do not boil, as it makes them very 
tough. When done, throw them into cold water for a few 
minutes, remove the fibrous skin from the outside, and chop 
the sweetbreads fine with a silver knife. A steel knife 
spoils the flavor on account of the acid they contain. As 



POULTRY AND GAME 179 

soon as the chicken is done, remove the skin and bones, put 
them back in the kettle to simmer longer, add salt, and 
the liquor may be used for soup. Chop the meat very fine, 
then mix it with the sweetbreads, and to every pint of this 

meat allow 

YZ pint of milk or cream 

1 large tablespoon ml of butter 

2 large tablespoon fuls of flour 

i large tablespoon ful of chopped parsley 

i teaspoonful of onion juice 

i teaspoonful of salt 
% teaspoonful of nutmeg, grated 

Cayenne and pepper to taste 

Put the milk on to boil in a farina boiler. Rub the butter 
and flour to a smooth paste, then stir it into the boiling 
milk, and stir continually until it is very thick ; take it 
from the fire, add the meat, and beat until thoroughly 
mixed; add the seasonings, tasting to see if enough salt 
and pepper; then turn out on a large plate to cool. When 
cold and hard, form into cone-shaped croquettes. (There 
are moulds that come for this purpose.) Dip first in egg 
and then in bread crumbs, and fry in boiling oil or fat. 
Serve at once with a small sprig of parsley in the top of 
each croquette. 

To warm over, place them on soft paper and stand 
them in the oven for a few moments. Cold roast chicken 
or turkey may be made into croquettes; you may also use 
calf's brains instead of sweetbreads, prepared in the same 
manner. 

Where the family Js small, the white meat of the 
chicken may be used for salad, and the dark for croquettes. 
With a pair of sweetbreads, a four-pound chicken will make 
a quart of nice soup, nine croquettes, and one and a half 
pints of chicken salad ; using all the meat, you make thir- 
teen croquettes.

cream. Stand over a very moderate fire until thoroughly 
heated. Chop the whites of the eggs very, very fine, then 
add them to the chicken. Mash the yolks of the eggs, 
with two or three tablespoonfuls of cream to a smooth 
paste, then add to the chicken and stir the whole over the 
fire until it comes to the boiling point ; add the wine, and 
serve immediately. 

More or less wine may be added according to taste. 

Calf's liver, after parboiling for fifteen minutes, is 
delicious dressed in this same manner.

Draw, singe, and cut the chicken the same as for a fricassee; 
put it into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and sim- 
mer for an hour or so until the meat is tender when 
pierced with a fork. Now proceed in exactly the same 
manner as directed in the recipe for Veal Pie. Serve in the

Salt and pepper 

Make the paste first and stand it in a cool place while you 
draw and singe the chicken. Cut it up as for a fricassee; 
pare and cut the potatoes into dice, cut the ham the same 
size. Now roll out half the paste into a thin sheet. Butter 
the sides and bottom of a rounding pot, line it with the 
sheet of paste, and trim the top ; roll out these trimmings 
into a sheet, and cut them into squares. Now put a layer 
of chicken in the bottom of the pot, then a layer of po- 
tatoes, then a sprinkling of ham, salt, pepper, and the 
squares of paste, then the remainder of the chicken, and 
then the potatoes, etc. Roll out the remainder of the 
paste, make a hole in the middle of it, and lay it on top 
of the last layer, which should be potatoes. Pour in 
through this hole about one quart of boiling water, place 
it over a moderate fire, and simmer continually for one and 
a half hours. Half an hour before the pie is done, add one 



POULTRY A'D GAME 185 

tablespoonful of butter, cut into bits, through the hole in 
top crust. When done, turn it out on a large dish so that

out for an upper covering. Be careful not to press out the 
sauce when covering. Brush the top over with beaten egg, 
and put in a quick oven to brown. When brown, place on 
a dish, draw the little rods that fasten the mould together, 
and remove the mould, leaving the bottom under the cas- 
serole on the dish. It will not show, and it spoils the cas- 
serole to move it. If your mould has no bottom, it must 
be browned on the dish you serve it on. Pour stewed 
mushrooms around, and serve. 

MARBLED MEAT 

1 good-sized chicken (five pounds) 
6 sheep's tongues 

2 hard-boiled eggs 

1 pound of ham or bacon 
^ teaspoonful of mace 

6 mushrooms 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley 
^ teaspoonful of cloves 

i tablespoonful of onion juice 

Salt and pepper 

Clean the chicken, and take all the meat from the bones. 
Cover the sheep's tongues with cold water, and boil gently 
for two hours; then skin and cut them into thin slices. 
Chop the ham or bacon ; cut the hard-boiled eggs into 
slices ; grease a mould (with a cover), put in a layer of 
chicken, then a layer of sheep's tongues, then a layer of 
ham, then a layer of hard-boiled eggs sliced, then a sprink- 
ling of the mushrooms chopped fine, parsley, cloves, mace, 
salt, pepper, and a few drops of the onion juice, then another 
layer of chicken, and continue these alternations until all 
is used. Press all well together, cover the mould, stand it 
in a pot of boiling water, and boil two hours. Do not 
have the water deep enough to cover the mould. When 
done, remove the lid and stand away to cool. Then turn 



POULTRY AND GAME 187 

it out of the mould, and garnish with aspic jelly or parsley 
and slices of lemon. 

The bones of the chicken may be used for making 
soup. 

CHICKEN IN JELLY 

i four-pound chicken i small onion 
i bay leaf 3 whole cloves 

i blade of mace % box of gelatine 

3 hard-boiled eggs Salt and pepper to taste 
Clean the chicken and cut it up as for a fricassee. Put it 
on to cook with the onion, bay leaf, cloves, mace and pep- 
per. Simmer slowly until the chicken is tender (about one 
and one-half hours if the chicken is young). When done, 
take it out, cut it from the bones in nice pieces, rejecting all 
the skin. Now put the bones and skin back into the kettle 
and simmer one hour longer. Cover the gelatine with a 
little cold water, and let it soak an hour. Put the chicken 
away until the next day. Add the gelatine to the liquor, 
stir over the fire about one minute, take from the fire and 
strain. If not clear, clarify the same as Bouillon. Taste 
to see if properly seasoned if not, add more salt and 
pepper and stand it away also. There should be about 
one and a half pints of liquor when done. The next day, take 
all the fat from the top of the jelly, stand the jelly on the 
fire to melt, then pour into a square mould about a half- 
pint, and stand it on the ice to harden. When hard, put 
a layer of the chicken on top of the jelly, then slices of 
the hard-boiled eggs, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, 
then more chicken, and so on until all is used. Now pour 
over this the remainder of the jelly, which should be cold, 
but still liquid, and should just cover the chicken. Stand 
away in a cold place over night. When wanted, turn care- 
fully from the mould, and garnish with parsley or light- 
colored celery tops. 



188 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

BONED CHICKEN 

i pair of year-old chickens i cup of stale bread crumbs 
y% pound of sausage meat i teaspoon ful of salt 
i tablespoonful of chopped i teaspoonful of onion juice 

parsley % teaspoonful of pepper 

Singe the chickens, cut off the heads and feet. The one 
that has the smoothest and best skin should be boned care- 
fully for the outside ; the other one may be used for the 
inside. 

TO BONE 

Place the chicken on the table with the breast down ; 
take a very small, sharp-pointed knife and cut the skin 
from the neck to the rump, down the backbone. Now 
carefully and slowly run the knife between the bones 
and flesh toward one of the wings. When you come to 
the thin bone, and the joint nearest the body, unjoint, 
and then separate it from the body ; now run the knife 
between the flesh and the bone of the wing, and 
remove each bone as you come to the joint ; the small 
bones in the tips of the wings cannot be taken out, so they 
may be either left on or cut off the first is best. Now 
run the knife close to the bones until you come to the third 
joint of the legs ; by twisting and cutting this joint, it 
will easily open, then separate it from the body ; take the 
bones out of the leg in the same manner as the wing. The 
lower leg-bone can be taken out easily by turning it wrong 
side out and stripping the bone down. Now run the knife 
between the bones and flesh, on the same side, until you 
come to the breast-bone. Then turn the chicken and bone 
the other side the same. Now pull out the crop; then 
take the neck in one hand and the flesh and skin in the 
other, and gently pull the flesh, and you will partly uncover 
the upper part of the breast-bone ; now take your finger 
and press the flesh from the breast -bone till you come to 



POULTRY AND GAME 189 

the edge, then lay the chicken on its back ; let some one 
take hold of it by the neck. Now take hold of the flesh 
and skin of the neck with your left hand, and pulling it 
gently down, with the knife cut the skin carefully from the 
breast-bone, the carcass coming out whole. All along this 
bone there is no flesh between the skin and bone, so it 
requires great care not to cut the skin, it should be per- 
fectly whole without one break when the chicken is finished. 
After removing the carcass, cut off the rump, leaving it 
attached to the flesh and skin ; see that it is clean, wipe 
the skin with a damp towel, and spread the chicken out 
flesh side up ; dredge it with salt and pepper. Cut up the 
other chicken, take the meat from the bones and chop it fine. 
Mix it with the sausage meat, add the crumbs, salt, pepper, 
parsley, and onion juice, and mix again. Take a small 
portion of this forcemeat and press carefully into the wings 
and legs where the bones have been taken out ; form the 
remainder of it into a roll the shape of the carcass, and 
place it in the boned chicken ; draw the skin together and 
sew it up from the neck to rump. Now turn it over on its 
back, tuck the wings back, and draw the legs down to the 
side of the body, press it with your hands until it is the 
shape of the chicken before you boned it. It is impossible 
to give it the exact shape ; it will look more like a duck 
than a chicken. Now wrap it up tightly in a towel, tie 
with twine, running it all around so that it cannot open in 
any place. Now place the bones from both chickens and 
the skin from the one you chopped in a kettle, pour in cold 
water enough to cover them, and a little more. Add a 
knuckle of veal, one bay leaf, one onion, four cloves, a 
sprig of parsley, twelve pepper-corns, a small-sized carrot, 
sliced. Stand it over a moderate fire ; at the first boil, 
skim it, add salt ; lay the boned chicken on top of these, 
cover the kettle, and simmer gently for four hours. When 



190 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

done, take it from the kettle, remove the towel, and stand 
away to cool. Simmer the bones two hours longer, then 
strain and stand the liquor away to cool. When cold, take 
the fat from the top. There should be two quarts of this 
jelly. If a knuckle of veal is not at hand, cover one box 
of gelatine with one pint of cold water and soak one hour. 
After you have taken the fat from the jelly, put into a 
saucepan to melt ; when melted and hot, add the soaked 
gelatine and stir until dissolved. Be sure that there are 
two quarts of the jelly ; if not, add hot water to make the 
quantity. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour a 
layer about half an inch deep in an oblong basin or mould, 
stand away to harden, then lay the chicken on top and pour 
over and around it the remainder of the jelly, which must 
be cold but liquid, and should just cover the chicken ; now 
put it in a very cold place over night. When wanted, wipe 
the mould with a warm cloth, and turn carefully out ; gar- 
nish with parsley and sauce Tartare. 

Or, when the chicken is done, remove the towel, place 
the chicken in a baking-pan, baste it with water, dust it 
with salt and pepper, and brown in a quick oven about 
thirty minutes. Stand it away to cool. Make the jelly 
as directed, season and put away to harden in a shallow 
pan. When hard, remove the fat, and chop half of the 
jelly on a towel with a silver knife. Place the chicken 
on a flat dish, and put the chopped jelly all over it about 
a half-inch thick; cut the remaining jelly into squares 
(about an inch) or fancy shapes, and place them around 
the dish, forming a border of jelly. In summer this is 
the better way, as the jelly melts so quickly. It may also 
be served without jelly, garnished with parsley or white 
celery and sauce Tartare. The liquor in which it was 
cooked may then be used for soup. A boned chicken 
may be kept four or five days. 



POULTRY AND GAME 191 

PRESSED CHICKEN 
An old chicken may be used for this. 

Draw and singe as directed. Wipe well with a damp 
towel, put in a kettle and cover with cold water. Pfece 
over a moderate fire, and simmer gently until the meat falls 
from the bones ; add one teaspoonful of salt when about 
half done. It will take about three or four hours to cook, 
if the fowl is old. When done, take the meat from the 
bones and cut it into small pieces, not over a half-inch 
square. Put the bones and skin back into the kettle, and 
boil until the liquor is reduced to one and a half pints, then 
strain, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Mix this 
with the chicken, pour the whole into a square tin mould 
and stand in a very cold place over night. A light weight 
may be placed on top to press it together, a flat-iron on a 
small board is best. When hard and cold, turn out of the 
mould, garnish with parsley, and serve. 

This is nice for picnics or a tea dish in summer. 

CAPONS 

A caponed chicken is drawn, cleaned, and singed in the 
same way as a common chicken. It may be roasted or 
boiled according to the recipes given for chicken, or stuffed 
with truffles and roasted, according to the recipe given for 
Turkey Stuffed with Truffles. A capon thus prepared makes 
a very recherche dish. 

TURKEY 

Young hen turkeys are best for roasting. The legs should 
be black, the skin white, the breast broad and fat ; and the 
shorter the neck the better. An old hen has reddish rough 
legs. A gobbler, if young, should have black legs and 
small spurs, and is always much larger than the hen of the 



192 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

same age. The flesh of an old gobbler is strong and tough, 
and it can be told by its reddish legs and long spurs. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH GIBLET SAUCE 

Clean and prepare exactly the same as Roast Chicken, using 
double the amount of stuffing^ and roasting fifteen minutes 
to every pound. 

ROAST TURKEY STUFFED WITH CHESTNUTS 
Follow the recipe given for Chicken Stuffed with Chestnuts 
using double the amount of chestnuts. 

ROAST TURKEY STUFFED WITH TRUFFLES 

For this procure a fresh young hen turkey. Draw and singe 
according to directions given for chicken. Cut one pound 
of ham into dice, stand over a moderate fire in a saucepan ; 
when hot, add two pounds of truffles, quarter of a nutmeg 
grated, a quarter-teaspoon ful of white pepper and a bay 
leaf; stir over the fire for fifteen minutes, and stand away 
to cool. When cold, put two tablespoon fuls of the mixture 
into the space from which the craw was taken, put the 
remainder into the body of the turkey, and sew it up. 
Truss, and hang it up in a cool, dry place for about five 
days in winter; in warmer weather, two days. Roast as 
directed in preceding recipe, and serve with truffle sauce. 

A turkey is delicious stuffed with mushrooms in the 
same way. 

COLD ROAST TURKEY 

The remains of cold roast or boiled turkey may be used in 
croquettes, bodines, blanquettes, terrapin, or any of the 
numerous dishes given for cold chicken. 

BOILED TURKEY No. i 

Draw and singe the turkey as directed for chicken. Truss, 
but do not stuff. Put into a kettle, large enough to hold 



POULTRY AND GAME 193 

the turkey, one tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoon ful 
chopped parsley, and, if you like, a teaspoonful of chopped 
onion j place it over a good fire, and, when the butter is 
hot, add water enough to cover the turkey. Take a cloth 
of suitable size, flour it well, and wrap around the turkey, 
then tie with twine. Put it in the kettle of boiling water, 
and simmer gently fifteen minutes to every pound. When 
done, remove the cloth and serve with oyster, egg, or bread 
sauce. 

BOILED TURKEY No. 2 

2 cups of bread crumbs 25 oysters 

1 tablespoonful of butter i large tablespoonful of 
Y* small onion parsley 

2 bay leaves 4 cloves 

i quart of stock Salt and pepper to taste 

Draw the turkey; wipe it, inside and out, with a damp 
towel. 

TO MAKE THE FILLING 

Drain the oysters, add them to the bread crumbs, then add 
the butter, parsley, one teaspoonful of salt and a dash of 
pepper ; mix all together. 

Fill and truss the same as in Roast Chicken. Now 
place the turkey in a baking-pan, spread the breast with 
butter, and put in a very quick oven to brown, about a half- 
hour. Then take it from the oven, put it into a soup kettle 
with the onion, bay leaves, cloves and stock. Cover, and 
let simmer slowly for two hours, or until the turkey is tender. 
Serve with the following or oyster sauce: 

THE SAUCE 

i tablespoonful of butter i tablespoonful of flour 

YZ pint of the liquor in Yolk of one egg 

which it was boiled Salt and pepper to taste 

Put the butter in a frying-pan to melt, add to it the flour, 



194 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

mix well; add the liquor, and stir constantly until it boils; 
add salt and pepper, take from the fire, and add the beaten 
yolk. 

If you use wine, four tablespoonfuls of sherry may be 
added to the stock when you put the turkey on to simmer. 

Serve cranberry sauce with it. 

BONED TURKEY 

To bone, proceed in exactly the same manner as for Boned 
Chicken. When boned, fill with the following: 

i pair of chickens weighing about eight pounds 

i cold boiled tongue 

i pint of mushrooms or truffles - 

1 pound of sausage meat 

2 tablespoonfuls of chopped parsley 

Chop the uncooked meat of the chickens very fine. Cut the 
tongue into very thin slices. Cut the mushrooms also into 
slices ; spread the turkey out on the table, with the inside 
up and the rump towards you; dust it well with salt and 
pepper. Now put on a layer of sausage meat, then a layer 
of mushrooms, then a layer of chopped chicken, then a 
layer of tongue, then a sprinkling of parsley and so on 
until you have used nearly all the materials given. Mix the 
remaining materials, which should be just enough to fill the 
wings and legs. Bring the two sides of the skin together, 
giving the turkey a round form, sew it up, turn it over, 
tuck back the wings and fasten them with a small skewer; 
bring the legs down by the side of the turkey and fasten 
them in the same way. Now finish in precisely the same 
manner as a boned chicken. (See directions given for 
Boned Chicken, and read the whole recipe very carefully 
before beginning.) 

In selecting poultry to bone, choose those at least a 
year and a half old, with a smooth, perfect skin, and dry 
picked. 



POULTRY AND GAME 195 

GALANTINE OF TURKEY 

Select a nice fat hen turkey weighing about twelve pounds. 
Singe, but do not draw. Bone as 'directed. (See Boned 
Chicken). Turn the legs and wings inside out, and draw 
them inside of the turkey. Now bone a chicken, turn the 
legs and wings in the same way, dredge both with salt and 
pepper. Place the chicken inside the turkey, with the 
rump of the chicken toward the neck of the turkey so that 
the white meat will not all be in the same place. Mix one 
pound of sausage meat or lean ham with one cup of bread 
crumbs and two well-beaten eggs. Form into a roll the 
shape of the turkey carcass, place it inside the chicken, 
draw the skin of the turkey together, and sew it up. Then 
press and roll with the hands until the galantine is an even 
roll. Tie at the extremities, and also across in two places. 
Now wrap tightly in a cloth, and tie as before. Put into a 
soup-kettle the bones from the turkey and chicken, one 
onion, one carrot sliced, six whole cloves, two bay leaves, 
a large sprig of parsley and three quarts of cold water, 
stand it over a moderate fire and bring slowly to a boil; 
skim, put in the galantine, and simmer gently for four 
hours. At the end of that time take the kettle from the 
fire and let the galantine cool in the liquor, then take it out 
and place on a flat dish ; put a meat board on top of it, 
and two flat irons on top of the board, and stand away over 
night. In the morning remove the cloth carefully, brush 
the galantine over with a beaten egg, dust with bread 
crumbs and parsley chopped very fine, place in a very hot 
oven to brown, then stand away until very cold. This can 
be garnished with aspic jelly, or a jelly made from the 
bones, same as Boned Chicken. It is to be sliced thin 
when eaten, helping a small portion of the jelly with each 
slice. 



196 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

A CAPONED TURKEY 

A caponed turkey may be prepared as Caponed Chicken, 
or roasted according to the preceding recipes. It is more 
tender, larger, and decidedly better flavored than other 
turkeys, and consequently commands very high prices. 

DUCKS 

Ducks, to be good, must be young and fat, the lower part 
of the legs and the webbing of the feet soft, the under bill, 
if the duck is young, will break easily. The breast should 
be plump and fat. 

ROAST DUCKS 

Draw and singe the same as chicken. Wipe inside and out 
with a damp towel. Make a stuffing from 
cup of bread crumbs 
t^poonful of powdered sage 
boiled onion, mashed fine 
large tablespoonful of butter 
teaspoonful of salt 
% teaspoonful of pepper 

Mix the whole well, and fill the space from which the crop 
was taken and the body of the duck, sew and truss them 
the same as a chicken. Place in a baking-pan, cover the 
breast with a thin slice of bacon, add a half-cup of water 
and a half- teaspoonful of salt to the pan, and bake in a 
quick oven (if a full-grown duck) one and a quarter hours, 
basting every ten minutes. Serve with a sauce made from 
the giblets same as Roast Chicken. If ducklings, roast 
only forty-five minutes. 

Green peas and apple sauce should be served with roast 
duck. 

Ducks may also be stuffed with potato stuffing. (See 
recipe for Potato Stuffing.) 



POULTRY AND GAME 197 

ROAST DUCKLINGS 

Draw, singe and clean the same as a chicken. Tuck the 
wings back, and fasten the legs down to the side of the 
body with a small skewer, or they may be sewed with a 
trussing-needle and twine. Put a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut in each duck, place them in a baking-pan, add 
a half-cup of water and a half-teaspoon ful of salt to the 
pan, and bake in a quick oven forty-five minutes, basting 
every ten minutes. When done, dish, serve with giblet 
sauce, same as Roast Chicken. 

Green peas, cranberry sauce or currant jelly should 
accompany this dish. 

RAGOUT OF DUCK 

1 pair of ducks 2 tablespoon fu Is of butter 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour i tablespoonful of onion 
i tablespoonful of mushroom juice 

catsup i teaspoon ful of lemon 

i bay leaf juice 

i pint of stock or boiling ^ gill of sherry, if you use 

water wine 

4 or 5 mushrooms may be added, if liked 
Draw, clean, and singe the ducks the same as chicken. 
Place them in a baking-pan, put a thin slice of bacon over 
the breast, add a half-cup of water to the pan, and bake in 
a quick oven three-quarters of an hour, if tame ducks; if 
wild ones, bake only thirty minutes. Now take from the 
fire and carve them, making eight pieces of each duck the 
wings, legs and second joints together, two pieces of the 
breast, and two of the back. Now put the butter in a 
saucepan, and stir until a dark brown; then add the flour, 
mix until smooth; add the stock or boiling water; stir con- 
tinually until it boils, then add the onion juice, catsup, 
lemon juice, bay leaf, salt and pepper to taste, and the 
mushrooms chopped fine ; now add the ducks and all the 



198 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

gravy from the dish on which you carved them ; cover and 
simmer gently twenty minutes, if tame; ten minutes, if wild. 
Take from the fire, add the wine, and serve on a heated 
dish with a border of toasted bread cut into triangles. 
Arrange them around the dish with the points toward the 
outer edge, forming a pointed border. They should be cut 
before toasting. 

SALMI OF DUCK 

Prepare the same as for Ragout of Duck, adding one dozen 
olives five minutes before serving time. 

TO PREPARE THE OLIVES 

Stone the olives by cutting around and around, keeping 
close to the stone in the same manner as you pare an apple, 
and throw the stone away. Put the olives in boiling water 
and soak ten minutes, then put them in cold water until 
wanted. 

GEESE AND GOSLINGS 

As geese live to a great age, care should be taken in select- 
ing. They are not good when over three years old. A 
young goose has down on its legs, and the legs are soft and 
yellow; like a turkey, as it grows older, the legs change to 
a reddish color. 

ROAST GOOSE 

Draw, clean, and singe the goose the same as a chicken. 
Wipe it inside and out with a damp towel. Fill with Potato 
or Onion Stuffing (see recipe for same). Sew it up and 
truss, being careful not to fill it too full, as dressing always- 
swells while cooking. Place it in a baking-pan, put a cup 
of water and a teaspoonful of salt in the pan, and place in 
a quick oven. Roast twenty-five minutes to every pound, 



POULTRY AND GAME m 199 

basting every ten minutes; after the goose has been roasting 
one hour, cool the oven, and roast the remainder of the 
time at a moderate heat. Serve with giblet sauce made the 
same as for Roast Chicken. 

Apple sauce should always be served with roast goose. 

Goslings may be roasted in the same manner, allow- 
ing fifteen minutes to every pound. 

GOOSE STUFFED WITH SAUERKRAUT 
Draw and singe the goose as directed. Wipe it inside and 
out with a damp towel, and fill with sauerkraut. Sew it up, 
tie into shape, and place it in a large kettle, cover it 
with about two quarts of sauerkraut, cover the whole with 
boiling water and simmer gently for three hours. At the 
end of this time take out the goose, place it in a baking- 
pan, baste it with melted butter, dredge the breast .thickly 
with flour, put it in a quick oven until a nice brown (about 
one hour). Serve in a bed of the boiled sauerkraut. 

GUINEA FOWLS 

A young guinea fowl makes a most delicious fricassee. 
Draw, singe, and cut up the same as Fricassee of Chicken. 
Put a quarter-pound of sliced bacon into a stewing-pan ; 
when brown, add the guinea fowl, and stir over the fire until 
every piece is a golden brown. Now add to every pair of 
guinea fowls two tablespoon fuls of flour ; stir until thor- 
oughly mixed ; then add one pint of boiling water, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, three or four dashes of black pepper. Stir 
continually until it boils. Cover, and simmer gently about 
one and a half hours, or until the fowls are tender when 
pierced with a fork. When done, taste to see if properly 
seasoned ; if not, add more salt and pepper, and serve. 

Potato croquettes are a nice accompaniment to this 
dish. 



200 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

GUINEA POT-PIE 

Make precisely the same as Chicken Pot-pie, using two 
guineas instead of one chicken. 

PEA FOWLS 

Draw and singe the same as chicken, and cook according 
to any of the recipes given for cooking turkey. 

PIGEONS 
POTTED PIGEONS 

^ dozen pigeons i pint of stock or water 

% pound of salt pork i bay leaf 

i tablespoonful of flour i onion 
i tablespoonful of mush- i sprig of parsley 
room catsup i teaspoon ful of salt 

A little black pepper 

Clean and wash the pigeons ; fill same as a roast chicken, 
and truss. Put the pork in a frying-pan and try out all the 
fat. Roll the pigeons in flour and brown them in the hot 
fat. When they are nicely browned, put them in a stewing- 
pan, add the flour to the fat remaining in the frying-pan, 
stir until a nice brown, add the stock or water, stir again 
until it boils, add the salt, pepper, catsup, bay leaf, onion 
sliced, parsley, salt, and pepper. Pour this over the 
pigeons, cover the stewing-pan, and simmer gently two 
hours. When done, remove the strings, strain the gravy 
over and around the pigeons. Serve with boiled rice in a 
separate dish. 

ROAST PIGEONS 

Draw, singe, and stuff the same as a chicken. Place them 
in a baking-pan ; put a half-cup of water and a teaspoonful 
of salt in the pan ; place in a quick oven, and bake one 
hour, basting at first with melted butter, afterwards with 
their own gravy. When done, dish in a row on a large 



POULTRY AND GAME 201 

meat plate. Add one tablespoonful of butter to the pan, 
and brown ; then add a tablespoonful of flour and mix 
well ; now add a half-pint of boiling water. Stir continu- 
ally until it boils, season with salt and pepper to taste. 
Serve in a boat. 

BROILED SQUABS 

Clean and singe same as a chicken. Split them down the 
back, flatten them with a rolling-pin, and wipe carefully, 
inside and out, with a damp towel. Broil the same as 
spring chickens. 

They may be roasted whole, without stuffing, the same 
as woodcock. 

SALMI OF SQUAB 

6 squabs i bay leaf 

slice of onion i tablespoonful of mushroom 

pint of stock catsup 

tablespoonful of Wor- i tablespoonful of butter 

cestershire sauce 5 mushrooms 

tablespoonful of flour i tablespoonful of sherry, if 
thin slice of carrot you use wine 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Clean the squabs and truss them. Put the butter in a fry- 
ing-pan ; and when hot, brown the squabs. Take them out 
and put them in a saucepan, add the onion, carrot, and 
bay leaf. Add the flour to the butter in the frying-pan 
mix well, and then add the stock, stir constantly until it 
boils, pour it over the squabs, cover them, and simmer until 
tender (about thirty minutes). When done, dish the squabs 
in the centre of a meat plate. Add to the sauce the mush- 
room catsup, Worcestershire sauce, and the mushrooms 
chopped fine, salt and pepper, and simmer for ten minutes; 
take from the fire and add the wine, strain it over the 
squabs, and serve. 



202 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

BAKED SQUABS 

6 squabs 2 tablespoonfuls of butter 

i gill of stock % pound of bacon 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Clean and truss the birds. Rub the breasts with a piece 
of onion. Divide the butter into six equal parts, put one 
part into each squab, and with it one cranberry. Now put 
them into a baking-pan, cut the bacon in thin slices, put 
one slice over the breast of each bird, add the stock, salt 
and pepper, and bake in a very quick oven (420 Fahr.) 
for three-quarters of an hour, basting every ten minutes. 

Put the livers and hearts in a stewing-pan to boil at 
thcTsame time you put the birds in the oven. Serve the 
squabs on buttered toast with the following sauce poured 
around them. 

Remove the bacon from the pan, then put into it one 
tablespoonful of butter, and brown, add one tablespoonful 
of flour, and the livers and hearts mashed fine. Mix all 
well together, add a half-pint of stock, stir constantly until 
it boils, add salt and pepper. 

Serve green peas as an accompaniment to this dish. 



GAME 

In winter game may be kept two weeks without spoiling or 
iosing one particle of its natural flavor, if it has not been 
packed and shipped. As our Eastern cities are supplied 
from the Western States, it is necessary that they should be 
packed for shipment, which causes fermentation, even if 
the weather is very cold. 

TO KEEP BIRDS FRESH 

Do not pick them, but make a small opening under the 
rump just large enough to take out the entrails, which do 



POULTRY AND GAME 203 

as carefully as possible, without breaking the gall. If you 
should be so unfortunate as to break it, pick the bird, wash 
it, and use immediately; it will not keep. Birds may be 
hung up by the feet in a cold, dry place for one or two 
weeks, until the feathers come out easily. 



VENISON 

Venison, like mutton, should be well hung in a cold, dry 
place, in winter, at least two weeks ; in warmer weather, 
one week. The meat should be of fine grain and nicely 
covered with fat. If the venison is young, the hoof will 
be but slightly opened; if old, wide open. 

HAUNCH OF VENISON ROASTED 

Wipe the venison well with a towel dipped in warm water. 
Leave the hoof and four or five inches of skin or hair on the 
lower part of the leg. Lard the haunch thickly with salt 
pork. If you have no larding-needle, make slight incisions 
with a small knife, about an inch and a half apart, and put 
a small piece of salt pork in each incision. It may be 
roasted without larding, but as the meat is naturally dry, it 
is certainly a great improvement. Fold a piece of coarse 
muslin into three or four thicknesses, wide enough to cover 
the hoof and hair. Dip this in cold water, and bind it 
around the hoof and hair, tie, envelop this in several thick- 
nesses of buttered letter paper, and tie tightly. This is to 
prevent the hair and hoof from changing color. If your 
haunch is large, the cloth may require a second or third 
wetting. Now place it before a brisk fire, or in a very hot 
oven, and roast fifteen minutes to every pound, basting 
every ten minutes at first with melted butter, and afterwards 
with its own drippings. When half done, season with a 



204 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

teaspoonful of salt and a few dashes of black pepper. When 
done, unwrap the hoof, and dish. Add two tablespoonfuls 
of flour to the fat in the pan in which it was roasted, stir 
until brown, add one pint of good stock, stir constantly 
until it boils ; take from the fire, add one tablespoonful of 
currant jelly and one of sherry, season with salt and pepper 
to taste. Serve in a boat. Currant jelly and water-cress 
should accompany this dish. 

SADDLE OF VENISON ROASTED 

Saddle and shoulder may be roasted the same as the haunch. 
As they cannot so well be larded, cover them with several 
thicknesses of buttered paper while roasting, to prevent the 
juices from drying out. 

VENISON STEAKS BROILED 

Steaks are usually cut from the leg or haunch. As it 
requires but a very short time to broil them, and they are 
not good unless very hot, see that everything and every- 
body is ready before broiling. Now put the dish in which 
they are to be served over a kettle of boiling water to heat \ 
put in it a piece of butter the size of a walnut, a quarter- 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of port wine, and a 
tablespoonful of currant jelly. Grease the bars of the grid- 
iron with suet, lay the steaks on it, and broil over a clear, 
hot fire, turning almost constantly. If your steaks are a 
half-inch thick, eight minutes will broil them. Put them 
in the heated dish, and turn them in the mixture once or 
twice. Serve immediately on heated plates. The quanti- 
ties given are for two steaks. 

Vension steaks may also be broiled and served the 
same as beefsteaks, with a simple dressing of salt, pepper 
and butter. 



POULTRY AND GAME 205 

VENISON CUTLETS 

Trim the cutlets nicely. Put them in an earthen vessel, 
and cover with a marinade made as follows: To every 
pound of venison allow four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, four 
of claret, two bay leaves, one small onion sliced, sprig of 
parsley, four whole cloves, and a blade of mace ; mix, and 
put into a porcelain kettle, stand over a brisk fire, give one 
boil and pour over the cutlets. Let stand until next day, 
turning them three or four times. Next day wipe and lard 
them, and broil over a quick fire. Serve with the same 
sauce as Vension Steaks. 

These may also be broiled and served with brown sauce. 

RAGOUT OF VENISON 

Ragout of venison may be made the same as Ragout of Beef, 
using venison instead of beef, adding one gill of port wine 
and one tablespoon ful of currant jelly to the sauce after 
you take it from the fire. 

SOUR STEW 

This can be made from the bones and meat, after the steaks, 
haunch, etc., have been taken off. Cut two pounds of 
meat into pieces about an inch square. Put a quarter- 
pound of sliced bacon in a frying-pan, and try out all the 
fat. Dredge the meat thickly with flour, and brown it in 
the bacon fat. Take it out with a skimmer and put it in a 
stewpan. Add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the fat in 
which the meat was browned, mix well, and brown ; add 
one pint of boiling water, stir constantly until it boils, and 
pour it over the meat. Cover it, and let simmer gently 
one hour. Now add one small onion sliced, one bay leaf, 
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a thin paring of 



206 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

lemon peel, a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoon ful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, and let simmer one hour longer. Take 
from the fire, add a tablespoon ful of vinegar, and serve. 

VENISON IN A CHAFING-DISH 

Put a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, in your chafing- 
dish ; and, when hot, put in the steak. When brown on one 
side, turn and brown on the other, and add a quarter- 
teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of currant jelly, two 
tablespoon fuls of sherry, and a little black pepper. Cover 
the dish ; let all heat together about two minutes, and serve. 

TO CURE VENISON HAMS 

These may be cured exactly the same as ordinary pork 
hams. They are usually eaten chipped, but they are deli- 
cious frizzled the same as dried beef. 



BUFFALO STEAKS 

Buffalo steaks are broiled precisely the same as beefsteak, 
seasoning only with butter, salt, and pepper. 
Buffalo meat may also be roasted or stewed. 



BEAR MEAT 

Bear meat is best roasted. It may be treated the same as 
pork, cooking twenty minutes to every pound. 

BEAR STEAKS 

Bear steaks may be cooked in a chafing-dish, the same as 
venison steaks, omitting the currant jelly. 



POULTRY AND GAME 207 

RABBITS OR HARES 

TO SELECT 

The body should be rather stiff, free from any unpleasant 
odor, and the flesh of a reddish appearance. If young, it 
will have soft paws and ears; if old, the ears will be stiff 
and the edges rough, the paws hard and worn. 
Tame rabbits, as a rule, are not fit to use. 

FRICASSEE OF RABBIT 

Skin the rabbit ; singe it. Remove the entrails, if it has 
not been previously cleaned. Wipe it well inside and out 
with a wet cloth, then dry. Do not wash or soak, as the 
blood of the rabbit is a great improvement to the flavor. 
Cut it first down the back, splitting it into halves ; then 
cut each half into four pieces. P'inish precisely the same 
as Fricassee of Chicken, either brown or white. 

BROILED RABBIT 

The rabbit must be very young and tender for this purpose. 
Clean as directed in preceding recipe. Cut into halves only, 
and broil the same as a spring chicken. Serve on a hot 
dish ; dredge with pepper and salt, and butter liberally. 

PANNED RABBIT 

Clean and cut into halves as directed. Place in a baking- 
pan, spread lavishly with butter, dust with salt and pepper, 
and bake in a quick oven one hour, basting every ten min- 
utes. When done, lay on a heated dish. Add one table- 
spoonful of flour to the fat in the pan ; mix well \ add a 
half-pint of boiling water, stir until it boils, add salt and 
pepper to taste, pour it over and around the rabbit, and it 
is ready to serve. 



208 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

RABBIT PIE 

Make the same as Chicken Pie, using two rabbits instead 
of one chicken. 

The English hares may be cooked the same as our 
common wild rabbits. 

SQUIRRELS 

Squirrels may be fricasseed, broiled, and panned precisely 
the same as rabbits. 

RACCOONS, SKUNKS AND OPOSSUMS 

These are eaten by many people, but as I have had no ex- 
perience in cooking the above animals, I will merely state 
that they may be cooked in all the ways that rabbits are, 
and served the same. 



WILD TURKEY 

Draw and singe the same as a chicken. Wipe inside and 
out carefully with a damp towel. Make a stuffing from 
two cups of stale bread, a quarter-pound of salt pork 
chopped fine, a teaspoonful of salt, and a quarter-tea- 
spoonful of pepper, mixed well together. Stuff the space 
from which the crop was taken, allowing room for the 
filling to swell, then put the remainder in the body of the 
bird. Truss. Place in a baking-pan, cover the breast with 
thin slices of fat pork, put a half-cup of water in the pan, 
and bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes to every pound. 
After one hour, cool the oven slightly, put a teaspoonful of 
salt in the pan, and baste with melted butter every ten min- 
utes at first, afterwards with its own gravy. Serve with 
giblet sauce, the same as tame turkey. Cranberry sauce 
should always accompany this dish. 



POULTRY AND GAME 209 

WILD DUCKS 

Wild ducks may be selected the same as tame ones. Can- 
vas-backs and redheads are considered best, but the blue- 
winged teal, black duck, widgeon and wood duck are all 
good. 

TO ROAST WILD DUCK 

Pick, draw, and singe the same as chicken. Wipe them 
inside and out with a damp towel. Do not wash them 
unless you break the gall or intestines, as it greatly destroys 
the flavor. If they have a fishy odor, rub the breast lightly 
with a piece of onion, and put three or four cranberries 
(uncooked) in the duck before cooking it. Tuck back the 
wings and truss the legs down close to the body. Put the 
cranberries and a piece of butter the size of a walnut in 
each duck. Place them in a baking-pan, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt and a quarter-cup of boiling water to the 
the pan, baste them well with melted butter, put them into 
a very hot oven, and bake forty-five minutes, if wanted 
rare ; one hour, if well done ; basting with their own gravy 
every five minutes. When done, serve with the gravy from 
the pan poured over them. Wild ducks are much better 
when not stuffed ; but if stuffing is preferred, potato is 
best. (See recipe for Potato Stuffing.) 

Serve currant jelly and green peas with them. 

SALMI OF WILD DUCK 

Proceed in the same manner as for Salmi of Tame Duck, 
and it is most delicious. 

RAGOUT OF WILD DUCK 

A whole duck, or the remains from yesterday's dinner, may 
be used for this dish. (See recipe for Ragout of Duck.) 



210 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

WILD GOOSE 

A wild goose may be selected and cooked precisely the 
same as a wild duck. 

WILD PIGEONS 

Wild pigeons may be prepared and cooked the same as 
tame ones. Roasted or baked, they make a very nice gar- 
nish for a wild turkey. After the turkey is dished, arrange 
six or eight pigeons around it ; fill the vacant spaces with 
curly parsley. 

This makes a very sightly dish. 

PIGEON PIE 

Pick and clean four wild pigeons, the same as chicken. Cut 
them into halves, put them into a baking-pan, baste with 
melted butter, and bake in a quick oven for forty-five min- 
utes, basting with melted butter, salt and pepper every ten 
minutes, using in all about two tablespoonfuls of butter, a 
half-teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper. At the end 
of this time, take them out. Line a two-quart tin basin 
or a raised pie-mould with plain butter paste. Have ready 
one pound of ham cut into dice, six hard-boiled eggs sliced. 
Put a layer of pigeons in the bottom, then ham, then eggs, 
then salt, pepper, and a few bits of butter, then pigeon, 
and so on, until all is used. Cover with a thick sheet of 
paste ; make a hole in the centre, and ornament with some 
leaves and flowers cut out of the paste trimmings. Bake in 
a quick oven for thirty minutes, or until the paste is done. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in the pan in which they 
were roasted, stir it over the fire until a nice brown, then 
add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and mix until smooth ; 
add orife pint of boiling water, salt and pepper to taste ; 



POULTRY AND GAME 211 

stir continually until it boils ; take from the fire, add the 
beaten yolk of one egg, and pour into the pie through a 
funnel, placed in the hole in the centre of top crust, and 
it is ready to serve. It is most delicious. 

Tame pigeons may be used, but are not as good as the 
wild ones. 

PIGEONS LARDED AND BROILED 
Pick the pigeons, cut off the head and feet, then split the 
birds down the back and take out the entrails ; wipe them 
well inside and out with a wet towel, and dry them. Lard 
the breast with lardoons (small strips of fat pork), using a 
very fine needle. Dust the birds with salt and pepper, place 
them on a broiler, and broil over a moderate fire for three- 
quarters of an hour, turning frequently. Place on squares 
of hot buttered toast, baste with melted butter, and serve. 
Squabs may be cooked in the same way, and served 
on a bed of green peas. 



OTHER GAME BIRDS 

TO ROAST PARTRIDGES, PHEASANTS, QUAIL, 
GROUSE, OR PRAIRIE FOWLS 

Pick and draw the birds the same as chicken. Wipe them 
carefully, inside and out, with a wet towel ; then dry them. 
Do not wash unless you wish to spoil them. Now tuck the 
wings back, and fasten the legs up to the sides of the body 
with a small skewer, so that when the bird is on its back 
the legs stand up, not down toward the rump, as you truss 
a chicken. Lard them thickly over the breast (this may 
be omitted, but they are not so good), place them in a 
baking-pan or before a good fire, baste with melted butter 
at first and afterwards with their own gravy ; dredge with 



212 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

salt and pepper when half done. Roast three-quarters of 
an hour, if liked rare \ if well done, one hour. Serve on 
squares of toast, with the gravy in the pan poured around 
them. Garnish with parsley. 

TO BROIL PHEASANTS, PARTRIDGES, QUAIL, 
GROUSE, OR PRAIRIE FOWLS 

Split them down the back, lard the breasts, and broil the 
same as pigeons. 

Serve currant jelly with them. 

TO ROAST WOODCOCKS, SNIPES, OR PLOVERS 
Many prefer these birds not drawn ; that is, the crop only 
is taken out through a small slit in the skin on the back of 
the neck, while all the entrails are allowed to remain in the 
bird. Of course, every one to his own taste ; but we pre- 
fer and recommend that they should be drawn, but not 
washed, as it certainly does spoil game or poultry to put 
them in water. Wipe them, inside and out, with a damp 
towel, and then dry on a clean one. 

For those who like the trail, as it is called, we will 
give the following recipe : 

Pick the birds, singe, and take out the crop as directed. 
Cut the wings off at the second joint that is, the second 
from the tip. Scald the legs and peel the skin off the feet 
and lower part of legs ; pick the necks all the way up to 
the head ; then singe, fold the legs close to the body, and 
rnn the bill of the bird through both legs and the body. 
Cover the breast with thin slices of bacon and fasten with 
twine. Now place the birds in a baking-pan with a square 
of toasted bread under each bird to catch the trail ; put 
them in a hot oven or before a good fire. Roast thirty-five 
minutes, basting every five minutes, the first time with 



POULTRY AND GAME 213 

melted butter and afterwards with the gravy in the pan. 
Remove the bacon five minutes before the birds are done, 
baste them with melted butter, dust with salt and pepper, 
and put back to brown. Serve on a heated dish with the 
squares of toast under them. Garnish with parsley and a 
spoonful of currant jelly. 

We will say to those who, like ourselves, prefer them 
drawn, proceed as directed above, only draw the bird and 
wipe it inside and out. 



TO ROAST RAIL AND REED BIRDS 
Pick, draw, and singe the birds. Cut off the ends of the 
wings and the feet. Leave the heads on. Wipe the birds, 
inside and out, and wrap each in a thin slice of bacon. 
Take a skewer long enough to hold six birds, run the skewer 
through the bacon and the bodies of the birds, fasten them 
on the spit and roast before a clear fire fifteen minutes, 
basting almost constantly with their own dripping. 
Serve each bird on a square of toast garnished with parsley 
of course, removing the skewer and bacon. 

Or, wrap the birds in bacon and tie with twine, place 
them in rows in a baking-pan, and bake in a quick oven 
fifteen minutes, basting three or four times with their own 
dripping. When done, remove the bacon and strings, 
serve on squares of buttered toast with the gravy from the 
pan poured around them. Garnish with parsley. 

All small birds, such as meadow larks, robins, black- 
birds and sparrows, may be cooked in the same manner. 

BLACKBIRD PIE 

Blackbird pie may be made the same as Pigeon Pie, using 
one dozen blackbirds instead of four pigeons. 



214 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

GAME PIE 

For this any of the birds mentioned in the preceding 
recipes may be used. We will use partridges. Bone the 
partridges according to the directions for boning chicken. 
Then cut them in halves. Cut one dozen mushrooms or 
truffles into thin slices. Cut one pound of ham into dice. 
Cut six hard-boiled eggs into slices. Chop some parsley 
very fine. Have ready one batch of puff paste and half 
the quantity given in recipe of Suet Paste (see recipe for 
Suet Paste). Roll half the puff paste down to the thickness 
of one-third of an inch. Grease a French pie-mould and 
line it carefully with this sheet of paste. With a sharp 
knife cut the paste even with the top of the mould. Roll 
the suet paste down to the thickness of a quarter of an 
inch, and cut it into pieces one inch square. Now put a 
layer of birds in the bottom of the mould, then a sprink- 
ling of ham, salt, pepper, parsley, hard-boiled eggs, and 
squares of the suet paste, a few bits of butter here and 
there ; now another layer of birds, and so on until all the 
materials are used. Now roll out for the top crust the 
remainder of the puff paste, wet the edges of the under- 
crust with cold water, put the paste for the cover on the 
pie, and press it gently with the thumb to cement the two 
edges together, and with a sharp knife cut off the upper 
paste even with the mould. Make a hole in the middle of 
the top crust. Roll out these trimmings of the paste and 
cut into leaf-shaped pieces, form and pinch them together 
in the shape of a flower, and place in the hole of the upper 
crust. Brush the cover of the pie with beaten egg, and 
bake in a moderately quick oven (about 400 Fahr.) for 
two hours. While the pie is baking, take the bones, hearts 
and livers of the birds, put them in a saucepan and cover 
with a quart of cold water ; add a slice of onion and a bay 



POULTRY AND GAME 215 

leaf, and simmer gently until the pie is done ; then strain. 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan and stir 
until a dark brown ; then add two tablespoonfuls of flour; 
mix until smooth ; add one pint of the stock from bones 
and liver, and stir constantly until it boils ; add six mush- 
rooms, chopped very fine ; season with salt and pepper to 
taste ; take from the fire, add the well-beaten yolks of two 
eggs, and, if you use wine, one tablespoonful of sherry. 
Pour the sauce in the pie through a funnel placed in the 
hole on the top, being careful not to break the flower. Lift 
the pie carefully on to a heated dish, remove the mould, 
and serve. 

Or, omit the sauce and allow the pie to cool. When 
cold, garnish with aspic jelly cut into fancy shapes, and 
put on the dish and around the top of the pie.

MEAT AND FISH SAUCES 
AND GRAVIES 



Once a week in winter and twice a week in summer you 
should make your gravy and sauce stock; and for this 
you should save every bone, cooked or uncooked, of beef, 
mutton, veal, ham, poultry and game, the green tops of 
celery and all juices left in the bottom of the dish from 
steaks or roasts. Keep them in a stone jar in a cold place 
until wanted. An economical housekeeper has always on 
hand a good supply of this stock without the outlay of a 
single cent. It should be made on ironing or baking day, 
thereby saving the use of any extra fuel. This stock could 
be used for soups, but is never perfectly clear and is not 
so nutritious as stock made from the shin of beef. 

The preparation of sauces and gravies is of the greatest 
importance, and in nothing does the talent of a cook more 
display itself. All ingredients used should harmonize and 
blend perfectly, and you must bear in mind that water is 
no substitute for stock. Many cooks fail in the thickening 
of sauces. The butter and flour should be well rubbed and 
cooked together before adding the liquid to prevent the 
sauce from having a floury, uncooked taste. The Drawn 

Butter sauce, simple as it is, is seldom properly prepared. 

(221) 



222 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

The common practice of wetting the flour and then stir- 
ring it into the gravy is objectionable, as in this way the 
flour does not hold the fat in suspension, and it therefore 
invariably floats. 

All sauces must be stirred continually while on the fire, 
and seasoned carefully, so that each sauce may have its own 
individual flavor. 

Spare the cayenne ; remember it destroys every other 
flavor as well as your own taste. 

"For palates grown callous almost to disease^ 
Who peppers the highest is surest to please" 

Goldsmith. 

STOCK FOR SAUCES AND GRAVIES 

Place in a soup kettle all the fresh bones taken from 
your roasts and steaks, cooked or uncooked, bones of mut- 
ton, lamb, veal, beef or poultry ; also, the trimmings of 
same if fresh, allowing one quart of cold water to every 
pound of bones and meat. Boil and skim same as Soup 
Stock -, add the same vegetables and seasoning. 

This stock is excellent for sauces and gravies in the 
place of water, but does not make a good soup stock.

SALADS 



In giving recipes for salad dressings, it is almost impossible 
to give exact quantities, especially if we consider the great 
diversity of tastes. Delmonico, it is said, used only one 
yolk as a foundation for a quart of oil, with salt and cay- 
enne as seasoning. For fish, meats, and some vegetables, 
such as cauliflower, tomatoes, and celery, this dressing 
(mayonnaise) seems appropriate ; but the simple French 
dressing for lettuce, served as a salad after a hearty meal, 
is best. In preparing these dressings, use a silver or wooden 
fork, a large soup plate, which should be very, very cold, 
and the freshest and best of olive oil, cayenne or white 
pepper, and good strong vinegar or lemon juice. A com- 
mon question is, " What can we use in the place of oil ?" 
Cream and melted butter may be used, but will not take 
the place of the oil. The Spanish proverb is that four 
persons are necessary to make a good salad: "A spend- 
thrift, for oil; a miser, for vinegar ; a barrister, for salt; 
and a madman, to stir it up." 

If you wish to preserve the crispness and flavor of 
green vegetables for salads, throw them in ice-water for an 
hour, then dry carefully on a soft towel, being careful not 
to bruise them, and then put in a cold place until wanted. 
Never mix any salad with the dressing until you are ready 

(233) 



234 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

to serve it. Use the coldest of dishes to serve it on, and, 
if garnished properly, it is one of the most attractive and 
wholesome dishes on the table. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put the uncooked yolks of two eggs into a clean, cold 
soup-dish, beat them well with a silver or wooden fork about 
one minute ; then add a half-teaspoonfnl of salt, a dash of 
cayenne, and, if you like it, a half-teaspoon ful of mustard. 
Work these well together, and then add, drop by drop, a 
half-pint or more of olive oil. You must stir rapidly and 
steadily while adding the oil. Do not reverse the motion, 
or it may curdle. After adding one gill of oil, alternate 
occasionally with a few drops of lemon juice or vinegar. 
The more oil you use, the thicker the dressing. If too 
thick, add a half-tablespoon ful or more of vinegar, until a 
proper consistency. More * or less oil may be added, ac- 
cording to the quantity of dressing wanted. \Vith care a 
quart bottle of oil may be stirred into the yolks of two 
eggs, alternating with a few drops of lemon juice or vine- 
gar, after adding the first gill of oil. It is easier, however, 
to start with three yolks when making a quart of dressing. 
In case the dressing should curdle, /. e., the egg and oil 
separate, which makes the dressing liquid, begin anew at 
once with the yolks of two eggs in another plate, and after 
stirring them well, add by teaspoonfuls the curdled mayon- 
naise, stirring all the while, and then finish by adding more 
oil as directed. 

In warm weather, it will take only one-half the time, 
if you put the dish in which you make the mayonnaise 
on a piece of ice, or in a pan of ice-water ; the oil and 
eggs should also be cold. 

This dressing, if covered closely in a jar or tumbler, 
will keep in a cold place one week. 



SALADS 235 

It also may be varied by adding plain or tarragon 
vinegar, whipped cream, a half-teaspoon ful of powdered 
coriander seed, chervil, or onion juice.

of plain vinegar. 

SALAD DRESSING

minutes, then add the salt and cayenne, mix again, and 
add the oil drop by drop, stirring rapidly and steadily all 
the while; then add the vinegar by degrees, and it is fin- 
ished. 

More oil and vinegar may be added to this if a greater 
quantity of dressing is required.

CHICKEN SALAD 

Draw, singe, and boil the chicken same as directed for 
Chicken Croquettes. When done, and perfectly cold, re- 
move the skin and cut the meat into dice. If you want it 
very nice, use only the white meat, save the dark for cro- 
quettes. After you have cut it, stand it away in a cold 
place until wanted. Wash and cut the white parts of 
celery into pieces about a half-inch long, throw them into a 
bowl of cold water and also stand them away until wanted. 
To every pint of chicken allow two-thirds of a pint of 
celery, and a cup and a half of mayonnaise dressing. 
When ready to serve, dry the celery and mix with the 
chicken, dust lightly with salt, white pepper or cayenne, 
then mix with it the mayonnaise. Serve on a cold dish 
garnished with the white celery tips. 



SALADS 237 

One cup of whipped cream may be added to every 
half-pint of mayonnaise, when ready to use it. It makes 
the dressing lighter with less of the oily flavor. 

The liquor in which the chicken was boiled may be 
used for soup. 

VEAL SALAD 

Veal salad may be made precisely the same as Chicken 
Salad, using cold roast or boiled veal instead of chicken.

When done, stand away to cool. When cold, cut into* 
thin slices. Wash and dry the tender leaves from one head 
of lettuce. Rub the bottom of a soup dish with onion 
and make in it nearly a half-pint of mayonnaise. Place a 
thin slice of onion in the centre of your salad dish, arrange 
the lettuce leaves around it ; mix the sweetbreads carefully 
with the mayonnaise, and put in the centre of the dish. 
Serve. 

This is a delicious salad, and if prepared as directed 
will have only the faintest suspicion of onion. 

Tarragon vinegar added to the mayonnaise is a great 
improvement.

pick out the meat, and put it away until wanted. Wash

naise together. Garnish the dish with the white leaves of

fingers on the outside of the body. Cut the meat into dice 
with a silver knife, and stand it in a cold place until 
wanted. Make the mayonnaise. Clean the two tail shells, 
and one back, in cold water, and with scissors, remove the 
thin shell from the under side of the tail. Wash and dry 
the lettuce leaves, put them around the salad dish in two or 
three layers. Join the shells together in the form of a 
boat, the body shell in the centre, place them in the salad 
dish. Mix the mayonnaise and lobster together, put it

DINNER-GIVING FOR SENSIBLE 
PEOPLE 



Little dinners, pretty and enjoyable, are, to my mind, the 
only rational way of entertaining. If people in ordi- 
nary circumstances are to make them a success, they must 
try no elaborate dishes, no long dinners which it is neces- 
sary to get some one in to cook ; for this is always evident, 
and makes dinner-giving both a burden and an expense. 
If little dinners are to be successful, they must bring 
neither, otherwise they lapse into long dinners, too often 
stupid, with the hostess too wearied to be bright, after a 
day spent in a hot kitchen, helping her incompetent cook 
to struggle with unaccustomed, and hence difficult, dishes. 
As one course after another comes on, their success is her 
chief anxiety, rather than the entertainment of her guests. 
Inexpressibly better a simple joint, with roast potatoes, and 
a fresh, bright hostess, whose only thought is the intellectual 
entertainment of her guests. 

The elaborate and conventional dinner, complete at 
all points, which the dinner-giving of a century and a half 
has evolved, is beyond any but the very wealthy. Very 
few of them succeed in giving it, and still fewer of their 

guests enjoy it, Its triple triplets of oysters, soup, and 

(247) 



248 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

fish, the releve, entrees, and roast, a pause of rum punch 
to stimulate languishing digestion, game with salad, sweets 
and ice, coffee to close, and a bewildering series of wines, 
with an alcoholic appetizer to begin and end, have, how- 
ever, had their effect in making many feel that a formal 
dinner must only follow this model from afar. So, with 
only the resources of a simple household, they compass, 
with infinite labor, oysters, soup, and fish, add some made 
dish to the meat, and put salad before and ice cream after 
the pudding or sweets. But success here, with a moderate 
income, is as rare as success with the long dinner at the 
complete table. Try to grasp the theory of the elaborate 
edifice which custom and convention has piled up, and see 
if your own resources cannot reproduce its purpose with 
better success. After having carefully analyzed it, you will 
see at once that the most complex dinner simply aims to 
begin with something of easy digestion, slide by some trans- 
ition to the roast, and make sure that through salad, sweets 
and coffee, the last half of your dinner shall interest the 
appetite as well as satisfy hunger. You, have, therefore, 
soup, roast, dessert, which make up the usual dinner of 
thoroughly civilized people, and below you will see how, 
with but moderate resources, you may so vary this as to 
make a "little dinner" complete and satisfying in itself; 
more, the most elaborate meal at Delmonico's cannot do. 

To begin with, don't have too many people. It is as 
bad as too many courses. Until years of experience have 
taught you how to conduct and carry on the conversation 
and social contact of eight or ten, six at the utmost are 
enough for a successful dinner. Get together around an 
evening dinner table, six of the pleasantest people whom 
you know (including yourself), put at defiance most of the 
traditions for a dinner party, and success will be quite sure 
to be the result. I say " night," because there is an inde- 



DINNER-GIVING 249 

scribable something about the meal, together with the hour 
and the lights and all, that seems to make people talk as 
they never talk at a noon dinner or at a tea. 

Have only what your cook can do easily, and, above 
all things, never try anything that you have not had suffi- 
ciently often when you are by yourselves to be quite sure 
she can do it well. If you are too far from the sea for 
oysters on the shell to be quite perfect, or even if you are 
not, begin with soup. Follow this, perhaps, with cream 
macaroni. It is more easily prepared than fish in any 
form, and almost every one likes it. This should be suc- 
ceeded by the usual roast, or something of the sort, with 
which serve one vegetable only, beside rice or potatoes. 
Then, of course, comes a salad, and after that some sweet 
as a dessert. East India preserved ginger is one of the 
nicest things possible, and not at all expensive, as a jar cost- 
ing $1.50 will make several desserts. Serve with it some 
wafers or delicate, thin water-crackers, and be sure to 
serve it from the jar in which it comes, standing the jar on 
some pretty plate. Lastly, comes black coffee.

EGGS 



To ascertain the freshness of an egg without breaking it, 
hold it before a strong light, or toward the sun, and if 
the yolk appears round, and the white surrounding it clear, 
the chances are it is good. 

Or, put them in a bucket of water; the fresh ones will 
sink immediately, those that float are doubtful. The shell 
of a fresh egg looks dull and porous. 

To preserve eggs, it is only necessary to close the pores 
of the shell. This may be done by varnishing, or by dip- 
ping in melted suet, and then packing them in salt with the 
small end downward. 

Or, make a lime water by pouring one gallon of boiling 
water over one pound of lime ; when cold and settled, 
pour it off carefully into a stone jar over the eggs, which 
must be packed with the small ends downward ; keep in a 
cool, dark place. I have used this recipe myself with per- 
fect success, the eggs being fresh and sweet at the end of 
three months. 

BAKED EGGS 

6 eggs 

2 tablespoon fuls of finely-chopped chicken 

2 mushrooms, chopped fine 

i tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

(353) 



254 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

y% teaspoonful of ground mace 

Dash of cayenne 

Salt to taste 

Boil the eggs fifteen minutes, throw them into cold water, 
shell them, cut them into halves crosswise, cut a little slice 
from the bottom to make them stand. Take out the yolks, 
mash them fine, add to them all the other ingredients, mix 
thoroughly. Fill the hollowed whites and heap up in a 
tiny pyramid, brush over with the yolk of a raw egg, and 
put in the oven to brown ; while they are browning, broil 
a slice of ham, cut it into as many squares as there are eggs. 
Make a Cream Sauce (see recipe). Serve the eggs on the 
squares of ham, and pour the cream sauce around them. 

BEAUREGARD EGGS 
5 eggs -fa pint of milk 

i tablespoonful of corn starch Lump of butter, size of a 
5 squares of toast walnut 

Salt nd pepper to taste 

Cover the eggs with boiling water and boil for twenty min- 
utes. Take off their shells, chop the whites fine and rub 
the yolks through a sieve. Do not mix them. Now put 
the milk on to boil, rub the butter and corn starch together, 
and add to the boiling milk. Now add the whites, salt 
and pepper. Put the toast on a hot dish, cover it with a 
layer of this white sauce, then a layer of the yolks, then 
the remainder of the whites, and then the remainder of the 
yolks. Sprinkle the top with a little salt and pepper, stand 
in the oven for a minute or two, and serve. This is good 
and sightly.

the sauce as follows : Melt the butter in a frying-pan, being 
careful not to brown it ; add to it the flour, mix until 
smooth ; add the stock and cream, and stir continually until 
it boils ; add salt and pepper, and stand it over the tea 
kettle to keep warm while you shell the eggs. Cut the 
whites into thin shreds, chop the yolks into tiny squares, 
then pile them in the centre of a shallow, heated dish, and 
arrange the whites around them. Give the sauce a stir and 
pour it around the eggs. 

BOILED EGGS 

The fresher laid the eggs are, the better. Put them in 
boiling water; if you like the white set, about two min- 
utes' boiling is enough. A new-laid egg will take three 
minutes, if you wish the yolk set. To boil hard, for salads 
or made dishes, will take ten minutes. 

EGGS FOR BREAKFAST 

6 eggs i tablespoonful of butter 

i tablespoonful of flour 2 tablespoonfuls of cream

6 mushrooms ^ pint of white stock 

Boil the eggs for fifteen minutes. Remove the shells, take 
out the yolks, being careful not to break them ; cut the 
whites and the mushrooms into dice. Put the butter on to 
melt, add the flour, mix until smooth; add the stock and 
cream, stir continually until it boils ; add the salt and pep- 
per, the whites of the eggs, and the mushrooms, stir over 
the fire until it comes again to a boil, throw in the yolks 
and let it stand over the tea kettle for one or two minutes 
until the yolks are heated. Serve in a small shallow dish.

Boil the eggs fifteen minutes, remove the shells, and cut 
them in halves crosswise. Slice a little bit off the bottom 
to make them stand. Put the butter in a frying-pan to 
melt, then add the flour, mix until smooth, add the milk 
and stir continually until it boils, add the salt and pepper. 
Stand the eggs on a heated platter, pour the sauce over and 
around them. Serve very hot. 

DEVILED EGGS 

12 eggs 

1 large teaspoon ful of French mustard 

2 heaping tablespoon mis of cold boiled ham or tongue 
i tablespoonful of olive oil 

Salt and cayenne to taste 

Cover the eggs with warm water, and boil fifteen minutes, 
then throw them into cold water for half an hour; this pre- 
vents the whites from turning dark. Remove the shells, 
and cut the eggs in halves lengthwise. Take out the yolks 
carefully without breaking the whites. Rub the yolks to a 
smooth paste with the mustard and oil, then add the ham 
or tongue finely chopped, the salt and pepper, and mix 
thoroughly. Fill the hollowed whites with this mixture, 
and serve on a bed of water-cress or salad. 

For picnics or garden parties, put the two correspond- 
ing halves together and press them closely. Cut white 
tissue paper into pieces six inches square, fringe the opposite 
sides, roll one egg in each paper, twist the fringed ends 
same as the candied secrets. Serve on a napkin, in a pretty 
little basket, garnished with smilax or myrtle.

and Parmesan. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a frying- 
pan ; when hot, turn in the eggs, and stir until thoroughly 
cooked and smooth. Serve on squares of buttered toast. 

FRIED EGGS 

Cut a nice piece of bacon into squares, put these in a frying- 
pan, and set over a gentle fire, that they may lose their 
fat. When as much as will freely come out is melted from 
them, lay them on a warm dish. Break the eggs gently 
into a saucer, and then slide them into the fat. Fry gently 
until the yolk is set. Take out with a slice, place on the 
warm dish, and garnish with the bacon. 

EGGS IN MARINADE 

6 eggs 24 whole cloves 

i pint of vinegar ^ teaspoonful of ground 

YZ teaspoonful of salt mustard 

1/2 teaspoonful of pepper 

Boil the eggs fifteen minutes. Take off the shells and stick 
four cloves into each egg. Put the vinegar on to boil. 
Pvub the mustard, salt, and pepper with a little cold vine- 
gar, to a smooth paste, and add to the vinegar when boiling. 
Stir over the fire one minute. Put the eggs in a glass fruit 
jar, pour over them the boiling vinegar, cover, and let 
stand two weeks. 

These are nice to serve as an accompaniment to broiled 
steak. 

EGGS sur le PLAT 

Butter the bottom of little egg basins or one large tin dish. 
Break one egg into each of the basins, being careful not to 
break the yolk, or six eggs may be broken in the large dish. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake in a quick oven 
until the yolks are set. Serve in the dish in which they are 
cooked. 



258 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

POACHED EGGS 

Strictly fresh eggs only are fit to poach. The beauty of a 
poached egg is for the yolk to be seen blushing through the 
white, which should be just sufficiently hardened to form a 
veil for the yolk. Have some fresh boiling water in a stew- 
pan, break the egg into a saucer, remove the parr from the 
fire and gently slip the egg into it. Now break another, and 
so on until the bottom of the pan is covered. Now put it 
over a moderate fire, and as soon as the water boils the eggs 
are ready ; take them up with a slice, and neatly round off 
the ragged edges of the whites. Serve on buttered toast. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

Break six eggs in a bowl and beat them gently until all the 
yolks are broken. Put a piece of butter the size of a wal- 
nut in a frying-pan and put over the fire to melt ; as soon 
as it is hot, turn in the eggs and stir continually until they 
are set. Serve immediately. 

STUFFED EGGS 

6 eggs i tablespoon ful of melted 

i tablespoonful of tongue butter 

or ham Salt and pepper to taste 

Boil the eggs fifteen minutes. Cut them in halves length- 
wise, take out the yolks carefully, mash them fine, add the 
butter, the tongue or ham finely chopped, salt and pepper. 
Rub together until smooth. Fill the hollowed whites with 
this, and press the corresponding halves together. Dip 
them first in egg, then in bread crumbs, then again in egg 
and again in bread crumbs. Fry in boiling fat. Serve 
hot with Cream Sauce poured around them. These are 
delicious but are difficult to make. 

PLAIN OMELET 

Put three eggs into a bowl, and give them twelve good 
vigorous beats with a fork. Put a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut in a very smooth frying-pan, shake it over the 



EGGS 259 

fire until melted, but not brown, turn in the eggs and shake 
over a quick fire until they are set ; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, roll and turn out on a hot dish. It is much easier 
to make several small omelets than one large one. 

BENGAL OMELET 
6 eggs 

i tablespoonful of Spanish onion, chopped fine 
i tablespoonful of chopped parsley 

Beat the eggs until thoroughly mixed, add the onion and 
parsley, and make the same as a plain omelet ; dust with 
salt and pepper, and serve. 

HAM OMELET 

Make the same as Plain Omelet, and as soon as it begins to 
thicken, sprinkle over it three tablespoonfuls of .finely- 
chopped ham ; roll, and serve. 

Cheese, Parsley, Jelly and Chicken Omelets are made 
in the same manner. 

POTATO OMELET 

Two boiled potatoes, chopped fine. Put a tablespoonful 
of butter in a frying-pan ; and, when very hot, add the 
potatoes. Shake over the fire until a nice brown ; then 
sprinkle with chopped parsley, salt and pepper. Stand 
them where they will keep warm until you make a plain 
omelet. When the omelet is partly set, spread over the 
potatoes, roll, and serve. 

BREAD OMELET 

3 eggs y<z cup of bread crumbs 

% teaspoon ful of salt j^ cup of milk 

i dash of black pepper Piece of butter, size of walnut 
Beat the eggs separately. Add to the yolks the milk, salt, 
pepper, and the bread crumbs. Now stir into this care- 
fully the beaten whites ; mix very lightly. Put the butter 
in a very smooth frying-pan ; as soon as hot, turn in the 
mixture gently, and set it over a clear fire, being very care- 



260 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

ful not to burn ; shake occasionally, to see that the omelet 
does not stick, the same as Plain Omelet. Now stand 
your frying-pan in the oven for a moment to set the middle 
of the omelet. When done, toss it over on a warm platter 
to bring the brown side of the omelet uppermost ; or, it 
may be folded in half, and then turned out in the centre 
of the platter. Serve immediately, or it will fall. 

SPANISH OMELET 

6 eggs 3 tablespoon fuls of milk 

i medium-sized tomato 5 mushrooms 
i small onion % pound of bacon 

i dash of black pepper j teaspoon ful of salt 
Cut the bacon into very small pieces and fry it until brown ; 
then add to it the tomato, onion, and mushrooms chopped 
fine ; stir and cook for fifteen minutes. Break the eggs in 
a bowl, and give them twelve vigorous beats with a fork ; 
add to them the salt and pepper. Now put a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut in a smooth frying-pan, turn it 
around so as to grease the bottom and sides. When the 
butter is hot, pour in the eggs and shake over a quick fire 
until they are set. Now quickly pour the mixture from 
the other frying-pan over the omelet, fold it over once, 
and turn it out in the centre of a heated platter, and serve 

immediately. 

OMELETTE SOUFFLEE 

Whites of six eggs Yolks of three eggs 
Juice of half a lemon 3 tablespoon fuls powdered sugar 
First grease a quart baking-dish with butter, and then see 
that the oven is hot. Now beat the whites to a very stiff 
froth, beat the yolks, add them to the whites, then the sugar 
and juice of lemon ; stir carefully, and quickly heap into the 
baking-dish ; dredge with powdered sugar and put into the 
oven. Bake fifteen minutes, or until a golden brown, and 
serve immediately. It may also be baked in paper cases. 



VEGETABLES 



All green vegetables should be freshly gathered, washed 
well in cold water, and cooked in freshly-boiled water until 
tender, no longer. After water has boiled for a time it parts 
with its gases and becomes hard, and most vegetables are 
better cooked in soft water. It is a well-known fact that 
split peas, dried beans and lentils do not boil soft in hard 
water. The salts of lime, sulphate or gypsum coagulate 
the casein which these seeds contain. In some cases, how- 
ever, the solvent power of pure, soft water is so great that 
it destroys the firmness, color and outside covering (skin) 
of the green vegetables, and allows their juices to pass out 
into the water. This is especially true of green peas and 
beans. In these cases, therefore, hard water is better than 
soft. A teaspoonful of common salt added to every gallon 
of water hardens it at once. A half-teaspoonful of bi-car- 
bonate of soda to every gallon of water renders it soft. 
French books recommend the same quantity of carbonate 
of ammonia for the latter purpose. 

Young, green vegetables should be cooked in boiling 
salted water. Onions, if boiled in pure, soft water, are 
almost tasteless, and all the after-salting cannot restore to 
them the sweet saline taste and the strong aroma which 
they possess when boiled in hard water (salted). 



262 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

If green vegetables are wilted, soak them for an hour 
or two in clear, cold water ; never add salt, as it hardens 
the tissues. 

Peas, beans and lentils are the most nutritious of all 
vegetable substances. They are said to contain as much 
carbon (heat -giving food) as wheat, and almost double the 
amount of nitrogen (muscle-forming food). The nitro- 
genous element of these vegetables consists chiefly of veg- 
etable casein. 

Lentils afford the most concentrated form of vegetable 
diet, and in olden times their nutritious value was fully 
appreciated. Esau sold his birthright for a mess of red 
lentil pottage. We read that the Pyramids were built by 
men who lived on lentils, garlic and water. A dish served 
to persons of distinction in the time of Pharaoh was com- 
posed of lentils, and with this high reputation they are 
almost unknown in this country, except to the Germans, 
who use them for soup, which, though made entirely with- 
out meat, is most nutritious. 

The potato, next to wheat, is the most important food 
derived from the vegetable kingdom. We may class it 
among the starch vegetables. It contains but little muscle- 
forming food, and therefore should be eaten with lean meats 
or other nitrogenous food, supplying the elements wanting 
in that food, and correcting the influence of a too-concen- 
trated form of nutriment. Potatoes are three-fourths water ; 
the remaining one-fourth contains a large proportion of 
starch, with a small quantity of albumen, casein and gluten, 
dissolved in its juices. 

In the spring the sprouts begin to grow at the expense 
of the starch in the potato; therefore, at this season they are 
less mealy and nutritious. The sprouts should be rubbed 
off as soon as they appear, or they will exhaust the starch. 
When they are wilted in this way they are improved by 



VEGETABLES 263 

being soaked in cold water several hours before cooking, 
and put on to boil in cold water. 

The cooking of potatoes is indeed an art ; they are 
dressed in some way in almost every family every day, and 
no vegetable is so often poorly served. Observe the fol- 
lowing rules and you will have no trouble : 

1. Be careful in the choice of your potatoes; choose 
those of medium size, free from blemishes and of a yellow- 
ish-white color ; and, if possible, acquaint yourself with 
the soil in which they were raised those from a rich, 
heavy soil being fnore nutritious. 

2. As the nutritious part of the potato lies near the 
skin, if you pare at all, do it very sparingly. As it con- 
tains potash, a constituent part of the blood, which is 
soluble in water, we would advise boiling in the jacket. 

3. If your potatoes are not wilted, put them on to boil 
with just boiling water enough to cover them, place over a 
moderate fire to boil slowly until nearly done, then throw in 
a half-cup of cold water, which will chill the surface ; by this 
you render the potato mealy throughout. Cook until soft 
enough to admit a fork. 

4. When done, drain off every drop of water, uncover 
the saucepan, sprinkle the potatoes with salt, to absorb the 
moisture, and stand on the back part of the stove to dry, 
shaking them over, now and then, to expose every side of 
the potato to the air. Remove the skins quickly. 

5. Serve in an uncovered dish. 

Potatoes are more wholesome baked than boiled. 

Cabbage-leaves are rich in gluten, therefore very nu- 
tritious. The mushroom, also, is said to contain 56 per 
cent, of gluten, and dried cauliflower contains more than 
either. 

Turnips, carrots, parsnips, and beets contain very little 



264 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

nourishment, but for this reason are valuable adjuncts to 
concentrated food, and produce the necessary waste for 
proper intestinal action. 

FRENCH ARTICHOKES 

French artichokes have a large, scaly head, like the cone of 
a pine tree. 

Strip off the coarse outer leaves, cut the stalks off about 
an inch from the bottom, wash well in cold water, then 
throw them in boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt, and 
boil slowly until the outer leaves are tender ; then take 
from the fire, put them upside down on a plate to drain. 
Arrange in a circle upon a hot dish, the tops up, pour over 
them Bechamel or sauce Hollandaise, and serve. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

Wash and scrape the artichokes, throw them into cold 
water, and soak two hours, then cover them with boiling 
water, and boil until tender ; watch closely, or they will 
harden again. Serve with Cream Sauce. 

PICKLED JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

Boil the artichokes as directed in preceding recipe, drain 
and put them in a stone jar. To every quart of artichokes 
allow one pint of cider vinegar, one bay leaf, one slice of 
onion, four whole cloves, and a blade of mace. Put the 
vinegar in a porcelain-lined kettle with all the other ingre- 
dients, stand it over a moderate fire, and bring slowly to 
boiling point, then pour it over the artichokes, and stand 
away to cool. 

They will be ready to use in twenty-four hours, and 
will keep two weeks.

BOILED ASPARAGUS 

Wash the asparagus carefully in cold water, and cut off the 
tough white ends. Scrape the white part which remains, 
and throw into cold water to soak for thirty minutes. Now 
tie it in small bundles, and put it into a kettle of boiling 
water, and boil for twenty minutes ; then add a teaspoonful 
of salt, and boil ten minutes longer. While the asparagus 
is boiling, toast squares of bread, cutting off the crust ; but- 
ter while hot, and lay on a heated platter. Take up the as- 
paragus, drain, cut the strings, and heap it on the toast, the 
heads all one way. Put a tablespoonful of butter to melt, 
add to it one tablespoonful of flour ; mix until smooth ; 
now add a half-pint of the water in which the asparagus 
was boiled, stir continually until it boils, season it with salt 
and black pepper to taste, pour it over the asparagusj and 
serve. 

STEWED ASPARAGUS 

Wash the asparagus well in cold water, then cut it in pieces 
about an inch long, rejecting all the tougher parts. Put it 
in a kettle, cover with boiling water, and boil thirty min- 
utes ; then put it in a colander to drain. Now put it in a 
saucepan, pour over it a half-pint of cream, add a table- 
spoonful of butter, salt and black pepper ; let it boil up 
once, and serve. 

ASPARAGUS IN AMBUSH 

i quart of asparagus tops i pint of milk 

9 stale breakfast rolls 4 eggs 

i large tablespoonful of butter 
Salt and black pepper to taste 

Wash the asparagus tops, boil fifteen minutes, and drain 
them in a colander. Cut the tops off the rolls, and take 
out the crumb, then set them open in the oven to dry, lay- 
ing each top by the roll from which it was taken. Put the 



266 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

milk on to boil in a farina boiler. Beat the eggs until 
light, then stir them in the boiling milk, and stir until it be- 
gins to thicken ; add the butter, salt, and pepper, and take 
from the fire. Chop the asparagus tops, then add them to 
the milk. Take the rolls from the oven, fill them with this 
mixture, put on the tops, and serve hot. Good. 

LIMA BEANS

thirty minutes; drain, add salt, pepper, and butter, or a 
half-cup of boiling cream. 

A sprig of mint may be boiled with the beans, and 
removed befqre serving. 

LIMA BEANS (DRIED) 

Soak one pint of beans in warm water over night. In the 
morning drain off this water, and cover with fresh warm 
water. Two hours before dinner-time, drain again, cover 
them with boiling soft water, and boil thirty minutes ; drain 
again ; cover with fresh boiling soft water, and boil until 
tender. Add a teaspoonful of salt after they have been 
boiling an hour. When done, drain them, dredge with a 
tablespoonful of flour ; add one tablespoonful of butter, a

All shelled beans, such as butter, kidney, and the 
small French beans, are cooked the same as lima beans. 

STRING BEANS 

Break the blossom end of the bean, and pull it back to 
remove the string. Then pare a thin strip from the other 
edge of the pod. In this way only are you sure that every 
string is removed. Cut the beans into pieces an inch long, 
and lay them in clear, cold water for thirty minutes. Drain

make the puree the desired thickness. Season with salt and 
pepper, let boil up once, and serve. 

Purees of dried peas, lentils and split peas are made 
the same as puree of dried beans. 

BOILED BEETS 

Wash carefully, but do not cut or scrape them. If the 
skin is broken before cooking, they lose their flavor and 
color in the boiling water. Young beets will cook tender 
in one hour. Old ones will require four hours. If very 
tough and wilted they will never become tender. When 
done, throw them into a pan of cold water and quickly 
rub off the skins. Cut them in slices, pour over them a 
tablespoonful of melted butter, dust with salt and pepper, 
and they are ready to serve. 

The cold ones left over may be covered with cold vine- 
gar and used as pickles.

Select a heavy white head. Remove the outside leaves, 
cut in quarters and soak in cold water one hour, then drain 
and cover with boiling water, let stand fifteen minutes; 
drain again, and press out all the water. Now put the 
cabbage in a kettle nearly filled with boiling water ; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a small piece of a Chili pepper; 
cover and boil one hour, if the cabbage is young ; two hours, 
if old. The Chili pepper is supposed to diminish the un- 
pleasant odor. 

CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE 

Wash the meat in cold water. Put it in a large kettle and 
cover with cold water. Simmer gently for two hours. In 
the meantime, remove the outside leaves from a hard white 
head of cabbage, cut it in quarters and soak in cold water 
one hour. After the meat has been simmering two hours, 
add the cabbage, and simmer one and a half hours longer. 
When done, put the meat in the centre of a large dish with 
the cabbage around it. Serve with it tomato catsup, mus- 
tard or horseradish.

270 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

hard part, and chop the remainder very fine. Put it in a 
stewing-pan with boiling water enough to cover, and boil 
twenty minutes. Drain in a colander. Turn into a heated 
dish, and pour over it Cream Sauce. 

STUFFED CABBAGE 

For this select a nice head of Savoy cabbage. Pour over 
it boiling water, let stand fifteen minutes, drain, scald again 
and let stand thirty minutes. Drain and shake until dry. 
Make the stuffing as follows : Wash two heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of rice in cold water, then mix it with a half-pound of 
sausage meat, add a tablespoonful of onion and a table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley ; mix all well together. Open 
the cabbage carefully to the very centre ; put in a half-tea- 
spoonful of the mixture, fold over two or three of the little 
leaves ; now cover these with a layer of the mixture, fold 
over this the next layer of leaves, and so on until each 
layer is stuffed. Press all firmly together, tie in a piece of 
cheese-cloth, put it into a kettle of salted boiling water, 
and boil two hours. When done, carefully remove the 
cloth, stand the cabbage in a deep round dish, pour over it 
Cream Sauce, and serve very hot. 

RED CABBAGE a la FLAMANDE 

Take off the outer leaves of a hard head of red cabbage 
and cut it in quarters. Scald, drain, and chop fine. Put it 
into a stewing-pan with a tablespoonful of butter, one 
onion, one bay leaf, two cloves, a teaspoon ful of salt, and 
a small piece of Chili pepper. Simmer slowly for one hour, 
stirring occasionally. Take out the bay leaf, add a table- 
spoonful of fresh butter, and serve. 

SAUERKRAUT 

Shred the cabbage fine. Line the bottom and sides of a 
small keg with the green cabbage leaves, put in a layer of 



VEGETABLES 271 

the cabbage about three inches thick, cover with four 
ounces of salt and pound down well, then another layer of 
cabbage and salt, and so on until the keg is full. Put a board 
on top of the cabbage, and on this a heavy weight, and 
stand in a moderately warm place to ferment. The cabbage 
sinks when the fermentation begins, and the liquor rises to 
the surface over the cover. Skim off the scum and stand 
the keg in a cool, dry cellar, and it is ready to use. Cover 
it closely each time any is taken out. When you use it, 
wash it in warm water, and boil it with corned beef or salt 
pork the same as cabbage. 

KOHL-RABI 

Kohl-rabi, or kale-turnip, as it is sometimes called, is a 
cultivated variety of kale or cabbage, distinguished by the 
swelling of the stem, just above the ground, in a turnip 
form, to the size of a man's fist ; the larger leaf-stalks 
springing from the swollen part. This swollen part is used 
for food. It may be served according to any of the recipes 
given for turnips ; or, uncooked in slices the same as 
radishes.

CORN BOILED ON THE COB 

Corn should be cooked as quickly as possible after picking, 
as it heats, and loses its sweetness. If necessary to keep 
over night, spread it out singly on the cold cellar floor. 
When ready to cook, remove the husks and every thread of 
silk. Put in a kettle of boiling water, and boil rapidly, 
after it begins to boil, five minutes. When done, take out 
with a skimmer, heap on a platter, and serve immediately. 

TO EAT 

Score every row of grains with a sharp knife, spread lightly 
with butter, dust with salt, and with the teeth press out the 
centre of the grain leaving the hull on the cob. Thus eaten 
it will cause no trouble, as the hull is the only indigestible 
part. 

CORN BOILED IN THE HUSKS 

Remove the green outside husks, leaving the cob well cov- 
ered with the inner light husks. Throw into a kettle of 
boiling water, and boil rapidly, after it begins to boil, ten 
minutes. When done, take out, drain, pull the silk from 
the end of the cob, and serve in the husks.

hull on the cob. Do not grate the corn, as in that way 
you get the hull. To this pulp add the milk, the yolks of 
the eggs, salt, pepper and flour ; beat well. Beat the whites 
of the eggs to a stiff froth, and stir them and the baking- 
powder carefully into the mixture. Put lard or dripping 
into a frying-pan ; when hot, drop the mixture by spoon- 
fuls into the deep fat. When brown on one side, turn and 
brown the other. Take out with a skimmer (do not pierce 
them with a fork, as it makes them heavy), drain on brown 
paper, and serve very hot. 

Canned corn may be used, allowing one pint finely 
chopped.

cob, add it to the beans, then add the milk, butter, salt, 
and pepper, stir continually over the fire for five minutes, 
and it is ready to serve. 

In winter, when the corn and beans are dried, soak 
both separately over night. In the morning, cover the 
beans with fresh water and boil gently for two hours. Do 
not drain the water from the corn, but keep it on the back 
part of the fire where it will not boil during the two hours 
the beans are boiling. When the beans are tender, drain 
them, add them to the corn, which should have just water 
enough to cover. Cook slowly for twenty minutes, then 
add the cream, butter, salt, and pepper.

in which the rolls were boiled ; stir continually until it boils, 
add salt and pepper to taste. Take from the fire, add the 
well-beaten yolk of one egg and a tablespoon ful of tarragon 
vinegar. Pour it over the rolls, and serve.

DUTCHED LETTUCE 

Wash carefully two heads of lettuce, separate the leaves, 
and tear each leaf in two or three pieces. Cut a quarter- 
pound of ham or bacon into dice, and fry until brown; 
while hot, add two tablespoon fuls of vinegar. Beat one 
egg until light, add to it two tablespoon fuls of sour cream, 
then add it to the ham, stir over the fire one minute until 
it thickens, and pour, boiling hot, over the lettuce; mix 
carefully with a fork, and serve immediately. 

MUSHROOMS 

It is highly important for those who employ mushrooms as 
food, to be able to distinguish those which are edible from 
the poisonous ones. The edible appear in old sod, in a 
clear, open, sunny field. They are at first very small on a 
short foot stalk, and are then known as button mushrooms. 
Their growth is rapid; in an hour the under skin cracks 
and the mushroom then opens, spreading like an umbrella, 
and shows the gills underneath, which should be a pale 
salmon color. In an hour or so it changes to a dark brown, 
and is then called "old." According to M. Richard, 
even mushrooms which are usually edible may prove poison- 
ous, if collected too late, or in places which are too moist. 

The skin of the good mushrooms peels off easily. 
Those with yellow or white gills, and those which grow in 
low, damp, shady places, or around decayed stumps of old 
trees, or any other decayed matter, are to be avoided. 

The good mushrooms have invariably an agreeable 
smell, while the poisonous have a rank putrid smell. It is 
always safe to use the canned mushrooms, which are con- 
venient and cheap, but tough and indigestible, and we cau- 
tion those who eat them to masticate diligently. 



VEGETABLES 285 

It is said that one poisonous mushroom among a pint 
of good ones, will turn a silver spoon black, if stirred with 
it while they are stewing 

DRIED MUSHROOMS 

Wipe the mushrooms clean, and peel off the skin. Cover 
the bottoms of shallow baking-pans with white paper, put 
the mushrooms in a single layer on this, and stand in a cool 
oven to dry. When dry and shriveled, take them out, put 
in paper bags, and hang in a cool, dry place. 

When wanted for use, put them in cold water or milk, 
and bring slowly to a simmer. In this way they will regain 
nearly their natural size and flavor. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS No. I 

Peel the mushrooms, wash them in cold water and cut off 
the bottom of the stalks. Then put them in a porcelain 
saucepan ; to every pint of mushrooms, add one tablespoon- 
ful of butter rolled in flour. Let the mushrooms cook in 
their own liquor and the butter for fifteen minutes, then add 
salt and pepper, and serve immediately. 

STEWED MUSHROOMS No. 2 

Peel the mushrooms, wash them in cold water and cut off 
the bottom of the stalks. Then put them into a porcelain- 
lined kettle; to every pint of mushrooms add a tablespoon- 
ful of butter divided into four bits and rolled in flour. 
Let the mushrooms cook in their own liquor with the butter 
and flour for fifteen minutes, then add two tablespoonfuls 
of thick cream, salt and pepper to taste. Take from the 
fire, add the well-beaten yolk of one egg, and, if you use 
it, one tablespoonful of sherry. Serve immediately.

TO STEW CANNED MUSHROOMS 

i can of mushrooms i tablespoonful of butter 

Yolk of one egg ^ pint of milk 

i tablespoonful of sherry, Salt and pepper to taste 
if you use it (white is the best) 

i tablespoonful of flour 

Drain the mushrooms. Put the butter in a porcelain or 
granite saucepan, add to it the flour, mix until smooth; 
add the milk, and stir continually until it boils; then add 
the mushrooms, salt and pepper, stir until thoroughly 
heated. Take from the fire, add the well-beaten yolk of 
the egg, and the wine, then serve. 

In cooking canned mushrooms, do not boil, as they 
are already cooked, and the second boiling toughens them. 

BAKED MUSHROOMS 

For this, choose the larger mushrooms. Peel, cut off the 
stalks close to the top, place them upside down in a pie 
dish, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and put a tiny piece of 
butter in each rnusi.. jom. Bake in a quick oven twenty 
minutes, basting two or three times with a little melted 
butter. Serve hot on the dish in which they were baked. 

BROILED MUSHROOMS 

For this, choose the largest mushrooms you can get. Peel, 
cut off the stalks close to the top, baste them well with 
melted butter, dust lightly with salt and pepper, and let 
them stand a half-hour. Then place them in a wire broiler, 
close the broiler very carefully so as not to break them, 
broil them over a clear fire, first on one side and then on 
the other. Open the broiler, remove them carefully with 
a spoon, place them on small squares of buttered toast, 
pour on a little melted butter, and serve.

dice and fry it until brown. Peel and cut the tomatoes, 
put them into a porcelain-lined or granite kettle with the 
okra, ham, stock, the pepper cut in small pieces, and onion 
cut in slices ; cover the kettle, and simmer gently for a half- 
hour. While this cooks, wash and boil the rice. When 
the okra is done, add the salt, pepper and sassafras leaves 
(called filee), let it boil up once, and serve with the rice 
around the dish.

BOILED ONIONS 

i dozen onions i tablespoon ful of butter 

i tablespoonful of flour y z pint of milk 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Put the onions into cold water and remove the skins. Put 
them into a saucepan of boiling water, add a teaspoonful 
of salt, and boil until you can pierce them easily with a 
fork (about forty minutes); then drain, and turn carefully 
into a heated vegetable dish. Put the butter into a frying- 
pan ; when melted, add the flour, mix until smooth ; then 
add the milk, and stir continually until it boils ; add salt 
and pepper, and pour over the onions. 

FRIED ONIONS 

Cover the onions with cold water and remove the skins. 
Cut them in slices, cover with boiling water, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and boil twenty minutes ; drain, add a 
large tablespoonful of butter to the onions and fry for a 
half-hour, stirring frequently ; add salt and pepper, and 
serve. 

BAKED ONIONS 

Choose large, perfect onions for this purpose. Trim the 
bottoms, but do not peel them. Throw them into a kettle 
of boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt, and boil rapidly 
one hour ; then drain in a colander. Take each one out 
separately, wipe it dry, roll in a square of tissue paper, and 
twist at the top to keep it closed. Now place them in a 
baking-pan, and bake in a slow oven one hour. When 
done, take off the papers, peel the onions, put them into a 
vegetable dish, and pour melted butter over them. Dust 
with salt and pepper, and serve. 

Spanish onions are particularly nice served in this way. 



VEGETABLES 289 

STEWED ONIONS 

Cover the onions with cold water and remove the skins. 
Put them into a saucepan, cover with stock, and stew slowly, 
one hour if young and two if old, or until they are very 
tender. When done, drain, and turn carefully into a veg- 
etable dish. Put one tablespoon ful of butter in a frying- 
pan, and stir until brown ; then add one tablespoon ful of 
flour, mix well, and add a half-pint of the stock in which 
the onions were boiled ; stir continually until it boils, add 
salt and pepper to taste, pour over the onions, and serve. 

BOILED PARSNIPS WITH CREAM SAUCE 

If the parsnips are young, scrape and throw into cold water; 
if old, pare and cut in quarters. Put them into a sauce- 
pan of boiling water and boil until tender (if young, three- 
quarters of an hour; if old, one and a quarter hours). 
When done, drain them, lay them on a heated dish, heads 
all one way, cover with Cream Sauce or Drawn Butter, and 
serve with corned beef or boiled salt fish. 

FRIED PARSNIPS 

Boil the parsnips as directed in the preceding recipe. 
When done, drain, season with salt and pepper, dip first in 
melted butter and then in flour. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of dripping in a frying-pan; and, when hot, put in enough 
parsnips to cover the bottom of the pan. Fry brown on 
all sides. ,

Boil the parsnips as directed in preceding recipe. When 
done, drain, and mash fine ; add to them a half-teaspoonful 
of salt, the flour, the egg well beaten, and a dash of black 
pepper ; mix well and form in small cakes. Put two large 



290 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

tablespoonfuls of dripping in a frying-pan; and, when hot, 
fry the cakes, brown on one side, then turn and brown the 
other. Drain on brown paper, and serve. 

STEWED PARSNIPS 

6 good-sized parsnips i teaspoonful of salt 

Wash and scrape the parsnips, cut them in halves and 
throw them in cold water for a half-hour. Then put them 
in a saucepan, cover with boiling water, add the salt, and 
boil for one hour. Take them up on a hot dish and pour 
over them the following sauce: Put one tablespoonful of 
butter in a frying-pan with one tablespoonful of flour, and 
mix until smooth; then add a half-pint of the water in 
which the parsnips were boiled. Stir and boil for five 
minutes, add salt and pepper, and serve. 



GREEN PEAS 

Peas, like corn, lose their sweetness almost as soon as they 
are picked. If you should be so unfortunate as to get 
stale or wilted peas, shell and throw them into cold water 
one hour before cooking, and add a teaspoonful of sugar 
to the water in which they are boiled. 

Fresh peas should not be shelled until just before the 
the time of cooking ; then wash them quickly in cold 
water, drain, throw into a kettle of boiling water, add a 
teaspoonful of salt to harden the water. This will prevent 
the skins from cracking. Boil rapidly from ten to twenty 
minutes. After they have been boiling ten minutes, take 
out one or two and press with a fork ; if they mash easily 
they are done. Drain, turn into a hot dish, add a lump 
of butter the size of a walnut, and serve. 



VEGETABLES 291 

The great point in cooking peas is to have plenty of 
water, boil rapidly and drain as soon as they are done. 
Peas cooked in this way will retain their color and sweet- 
ness. 

TO COOK CANNED PEAS 

After opening the can, drain the peas free from all liquor. 
Turn them into a saucepan, and to every pint-can add a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut ; salt and pepper to 
taste ; stir gently until thoroughly heated, and serve at 
once. 

PUREE OF PEAS 

i quart of green peas or i pint of milk 

two pint cans i pint of water 

i tablespoonful of butter i tablespoonful of flour 

1 bay leaf i onion 

2 cloves i sprig of parsley 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Wash the peas in cold water ; then put them in a saucepan 
with the water and boil twenty minutes. When done they 
should be almost dry. Press through a colander. Put the 
milk on to boil in a farina boiler. Add the bay leaf, onion, 
cloves and parsley. Rub the butter and flour together 
until smooth. Strain the milk into the peas, then return 
to the farina boiler, stir in the butter and flour, and stir 
continually until it boils and thickens; then add the salt 
and pepper, and serve. 

Puree of lima, or any other green beans, may be 
made according to this recipe. 

POKE STALKS 

In the spring the young shoots are much used as food. 
They should not be over four inches long, and should show 
only a tuft of leaves at the top. Older than this they are 
poisonous. 



292 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Wash and lay in cold water for one hour ; then tie in 
bundles, as you do asparagus. Put it into a kettle of boiling 
water and boil three-quarters of an hour ; drain, lay on 
buttered toast, dust with salt and pepper, cover with Drawn 
Butter, and serve. 

STEAMED POTATOES 

Wash and scrub the potatoes well, place them in a steamer 
or colander over a kettle of boiling water ; cover and 
steam until you can pierce with a fork ; it takes a little 
longer to steam than boil, but the potato, being naturally 
watery, should never be cooked by boiling if you have the 
conveniences for steaming. When done, remove the skins 
quickly, and serve in an uncovered dish. 

BOILED POTATOES 

Pare six good-sized potatoes, and let them lie in cold water 
one hour. Then put them in a kettle of boiling water, and 
boil slowly until they are soft enough to admit a fork. Then 
pour off the water. (If you allow them to remain in the water 
one second after they are done, they will become waxy and 
watery.) Uncover the kettle, dredge with salt, and 
shake them so that all sides may be exposed to the cold air. 
Cover the boiler with a napkin, and let stand on one side 
of the fire for five minutes, and they are ready to serve. 

Old potatoes that have sprouted and are shriveled, are 
better covered with cold water instead of boiling water. 

POTATOES BOILED IN THEIR SKINS 

Select potatoes of uniform size, wash and scrub them well ; 
let them stand in cold water for a half-hour, then put them 
into a kettle of boiling water, and boil slowly until you 
can pierce easily with a fork; then drain very dry, 



VEGETABLES 293 

dredge with salt, and stand on the back of the fire with 
the lid of the kettle off, for five minutes. Peel quickly, 
and serve in an uncovered vegetable dish. 

MASHED POTATOES 

Boil as directed in recipe for Boiled Potatoes. When 
done and dry, mash quickly with a wire masher until light 
and free from all lumps ; add a piece of butter the size of 
a walnut, a quarter-cup of boiling cream, a teaspoonful 
of salt, and a dash of pepper. Beat with a fork until 
very light. Serve in a heated, uncovered dish. The pota- 
toes may also be pressed through a "Henis Vegetable 
Press," which removes the smallest lumps and makes them 
very light. 

STEWED POTATOES 

Pare six potatoes, cut them into dice ; throw them into 
cold water for fifteen minutes, drain, and cover with boil- 
ing water and boil until tender ; then drain off every drop 
of water ; dredge them with a tablespoonful of flour, add 
apiece of butter the size of a walnut, a half-pint of milk, a 
half-teaspoon ful of salt, and a little black pepper; stir 
carefully until they boil, and serve in a heated dish.

to bake, for a half-hour. Serve in the dish in which it was 
baked. 

FRIED POTATOES (FRENCH) 

Pare the potatoes and throw them into cold water for one 
hour. Then cut them, either with a vegetable spoon, or in 
slices or blocks. Have ready a pan of very hot lard ; dry the 
potatoes on a towel. This must be done quickly, so as not 
to allow the potato to discolor. Now drop them quickly 
into the hot lard. When done, take them out with a skim- 
mer, and put in a colander. Stand the colander on a tin 
plate, and then in the oven, with the door open, to keep 
warm while you fry the remainder. When all are done, 
sprinkle with salt, and serve hot. 

When cut with a vegetable spoon, they are used to 
garnish boiled or baked fish. 

FRIED POTATOES 

Cut cold boiled potatoes in slices. Put two tablespoonfuls 
of lard or dripping into a frying-pan ; when hot, put in 
just enough potatoes to cover the bottom of. the pan. 
When brown on one side, turn and brown the other ; 
then dish and keep warm while you fry another panful, and 
in this way fry the desired quantity, adding more lard or 
dripping as you consume it. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES 

Cut cold boiled or steamed potatoes into dice, and to every 
pint of these dice allow one good-sized onion, one table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, a dash of black pepper, a 



VEGETABLES 297 

sprinkling of salt, and one tablespoonful of butter. Put 
the butter into a frying-pan ; when hot, add the onion 
cut in thin slices ; fry and stir until half done, then add 
the potatoes ; fry and stir gently until the potatoes are all 
a nice light brown. It may require a little more butter, as 
no vegetable absorbs so much butter as the potato. When 
done, turn into a hot dish, sprinkle with the salt, pepper, 
and parsley, and serve very hot. 

SARATOGA CHIPS 

Pare one large potato, and cut in very thin slices, on a vege- 
table cutter, over a bowl of cold water, so that each slice 
will fall into the water (this makes them light and dry 
after being fried) ; soak ten minutes, then take out a few 
pieces at a time, and dry them on a soft towel. Have 
ready a kettle of boiling lard. Throw in the slices, a few 
at a time, stir them with a skimmer ; when a light brown, 
take them out, and place on a piece of soft brown paper in 
a colander, dredge with salt, and stand in the open oven 
to keep warm while you fry the remainder. Turn the first 
from the colander into a hot dish, and skim out the second 
frying on the paper, and so continue until you have finished. 

SWELLED POTATOES 

Pare the potatoes, and cut in slices about the sixteenth of 
an inch in thickness ; then dry them on a towel. Do not 
soak in cold water. Have ready two pans of hot lard, one 
a little hotter than the other ; turn the potatoes, a few at a 
time, into the coolest lard. When fried, take them out, 
drain a half-minute in the colander, then throw them into 
the very hot lard, for an instant, to swell or puff. If the 
second lard is quite hot, and the potatoes are good, they 
will certainly swell. When done, dust them with salt, and 
serve very hot.

BAKED POTATOES WITH MEAT 

Wash and pare potatoes of uniform size, and one hour be- 
fore the meat is done, put them in the baking-pan around 
the meat, and baste with the dripping every time you baste 
the meat. 

BAKED POTATOES 

As potatoes contain potash, an important constituent of 
the blood, which is freely soluble in water, they are much 
more wholesome baked than boiled. 

Wash and scrub the potatoes, place them in a baking- 
pan, then in a quick oven, to bake for thirty minutes, or 
until you can mash them between the hands. Do not try 
them with a fork, as that allows the steam to escape, and 
consequently the potato is heavy. Use as soon as done, or 
they will become watery. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

Bake six good-sized potatoes. When done, cut the tops off, 
and with a spoon scoop out the potato into a hot bowl. 
Mash fine, and add one tablespoonful of butter, a quarter- 
cup of hot milk, a teaspoonful of salt, and pepper to taste. 
Beat until very light, then add the well-beaten whites of 
two eggs ; stir gently. Fill the skins with this mixture, 
heaping it on the top ; brush over with the yolk of the 
eggs, put in the oven to brown. 

They may also be cut into halves and stuffed. 

POTATO SOUFFLE 

Steam six good-sized potatoes in their jackets. When done, 
peel and mash them ; then add one tablespoonful of butter 
(one ounce), a half-pint of hot cream, one teaspoonful of 
salt, and black pepper to taste. Now beat until smooth and 
light. Beat the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, stir them 



VEGETABLES 299 

gently into the potatoes, heap on a baking-dish, and put in 
a quick oven to brown. Serve in the dish in which they 
were baked. 

Two heaping tablespoon fuls of grated cheese added 
with the cream is an improvement. 

PUREE OF POTATOES 

4 medium-sized potatoes i pint of milk 

i teaspoonful of onion juice i tablespoon ful of butter 
i tablespoon ful of flour Salt and pepper to taste 

Pare the potatoes, and soak in cold water for a half-hour, 
then put them in boiling water and boil slowly until you 
can pierce them with a fork. Put the milk on to boil in a 
farina boiler. Rub the butter and flour together until 
smooth, then stir into the boiling milk ; stir until it thick- 
ens, then add the onion juice, salt, and pepper. Drain the 
potatoes and mash them through a colander ; add to them the 
milk, stir, and press through a sieve. Then return to the 
farina boiler ; boil five minutes, and serve. 

ROAST SWEET POTATOES 

Wash and scrub potatoes of uniform size ; do not cut or 
scratch them. Put them in a baking-pan, place in a hot 
oven, and bake until, when pressed between the hands, they 
seem mellow in the centre. Serve in their jackets immedi- 
ately. 

BOILED SWEET POTATOES 

Wash and scrub potatoes of uniform size ; do not cut or 
break the skin. Put them in a kettle of boiling water, and 
boil until, when you pierce with a fork, they are just a lit- 
tle hard in the centre. Now drain by raising the cover 
just enough to admit the draining off the water when you 
tilt the kettle. This is much better than draining in a col- 
ander. Stand the kettle on the back part of the fire, cover 



300 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

with a napkin, and let steam ten minutes. In this way the 
potatoes will be mealy and dry. 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES 

Skin and cut lengthwise boiled sweet potatoes. Put three 
tablespoon fuls of dripping in a large frying-pan, dust the 
potatoes with salt and pepper, throw them into the hot fat, 
brown first on one side, then turn and brown the other. 
Serve very hot. 

SWEET POTATOES ROASTED UNDER THE MEAT 

Wash and pare potatoes of uniform size. One hour before 
the meat is done put them in the baking-pan with the meat, 
and baste every ten minntes with the dripping. 

TO WARM OVER SWEET POTATOES 

Cut cold boiled or baked sweet potatoes in thin slices. 
To every pint of these slices allow two tablespoon fuls of 
butter, a teaspoonful of chopped onion, a half-pint of 
stock, salt and pepper to taste. Put the butter in a frying- 
pan ; when hot, throw in the potatoes and onion, fry and 
stir gently until a nice brown ; then take them out with a 
skimmer and keep warm while you make the sauce. Add 
the flour to the butter remaining in the pan, mix until 
smooth, then add the stock, stir continually until it boils; 
add the salt and pepper; take from the fire, and add the 
yolk of one egg; pour over the potatoes, and serve. 

BAKED PUMPKIN 

Cut the pumpkin first in halves, then in quarters; remove the 
seeds, but not the rind. Place in a baking-pan with the 
rind downwards, and bake in a slow oven until tender 
when you pierce with a fork. When done, serve in the 
rind ; help it out by spoonfuls as you would mashed pota- 
toes.

RADISHES (Blot) 

Cut off the roots close to the radish. Cut off the tops 
about an inch from the radish. Wash clean in cold water. 
Take the radish with the left hand, holding it by the top; 
cut the skin from the top downwards, in several parts, like 
you cut an orange to remove the skin, without detaching it. 
Do the same carefully with the body of the radish, and it 
will look more like a rose than a radish. After having 
prepared two or three it will be comparatively easy. The 
centre leaves must be eaten as well as the body of the 
radish ; they contain a substance that helps the digestion 
of the radish itself. 

BOILED SALSIFY OR OYSTER PLANT 
Wash and scrape one dozen roots of salsify. Throw each 
one into cold water as soon as you have scraped it, or it will 
turn black. Then put them into a kettle of boiling water, 
and boil until tender (about one hour) ; drain, cover wi'th 
Cream Sauce, and serve. 

SALSIFY CAKES OR FRITTERS 
These are made precisely the same as Parsnip Fritters. 

SPINACH 

Wash a half-peck of spinach through several waters to free 
it from grit. Pick it over very carefully and cut off the 
roots. Wash again, drain, and take up by handfuls, shake 
and press out all the remaining water. Put it in a kettle, 
and add one cup of water ; cover the kettle, place over a 
moderate fire, and allow the spinach to thus steam for 
twenty minutes. Then drain in a colander; turn into a 
chopping- tray and chop very fine; // cannot be too fine; 
put into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of butter, salt and 
pepper to taste, stir until very hot. Have a heated dish at 
hand, and arrange on it small squares of buttered toast. 



302 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Mould the spinach by packing it tightly in a cup, and turn 
each cupful out on a slice of toast. Place half of a hard- 
boiled egg on the top of each mould. Pour Drawn Butter 
around the toast, and serve. 

Or, when done, drain, chop fine, serve in a heated 
vegetable dish. Cut hard-boiled eggs in slices and lay on 
top. 

A half-peck of spinach will serve five people. 

SUMMER SQUASH (BOILED) 

Pare and cut in slices three summer squashes, remove the 
seeds and cut the slices in squares. Put them into a sauce- 
pan, cover with boiling water, add a teaspoonful of salt and 
boil twenty minutes. When done, drain in a colander and 
press gently; then mash fine, turn into a strainer cloth, 
and squeeze until the squash is dry. Now put into a small 
saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and the squash, add salt 
arid pepper to taste, stir until thoroughly heated, and serve. 
Or, cut into slices, dust with salt and pepper, dip first 
in egg and then in bread crumbs, and fry, and serve the 
same as egg plants. 

WINTER SQUASH 

The small Hubbard squash is best for baking. Saw the 
squash in halves; scrape out the soft part and the seeds. 
Put the halves in the oven, and bake about three-quarters 
of an hour, or until tender. Serve in the shell. Help out 
by spoonfuls. 

PUREE OF SORREL 

YZ peck of sorrel ^ cup of veal stock 

i tablespoonful of butter Salt and pepper to taste 
Wash the sorrel through several cold waters, cut off the 
steins the leaves only are good. Put a cup of cold water 
and a teaspoonful of salt in a saucepan, and throw in the 



VEGETABLES 303 

sorrel at the first boil. Cover the saucepan and boil for 
twenty minutes. When done, drain, and chop vety fine, 
then press through a colander; return it to the saucepan, 
add the butter, stock, salt and pepper, let it boil up once, 
and it is ready to serve. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Pour boiling water over them, with a sharp knife remove 
the skins and the hard stem ends, and cut them in small 
pieces. Stew in a porcelain-lined or granite saucepan for 
a half-hour, then add to 'every quart of tomatoes a table- 
spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, salt and pepper 
to taste. Stew fifteen or twenty minutes longer, or until 
they are of the desired thickness. 

Some prefer the tomatoes stewed only thirty minutes 
and thickened with bread crumbs. 

A slice of onion may be added to the tomatoes when 
first put on to cook, and to me is a great improvement, 
filling the same place that the sprig of mint does in peas or 
beans. 

BAKED TOMATOES 

Choose six large, smooth tomatoes. Cut a slice off the 
stem ends, and with your finger carefully scoop out the 
seeds. Mix together a half-cup of finely-chopped, cold, 
boiled ham, twelve chopped mushrooms, two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of stale bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, a half-teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cay- 
enne, and a tablespoonful of melted butter. Fill the toma- 
toes with this mixture, heaping it in the centre ; sprinkle 
over the tops with bread crumbs ; place the tomatoes in a 
granite baking-pan, baste with melted butter, and bake in 
a hot oven thirty minutes. When done, take them up care- 
fully with a cake-turner, and serve. 



304 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

TOMATO FARCI 

Put a layer of tomatoes in the bottom of a baking-dish, 
then a layer of bread crumbs, then a sprinkling of salt and 
pepper, then another layer of tomatoes, and so con- 
tinue until the dish is full, having the last layer crumbs. 
Put a few bits of butter over the top and bake in a quick 
oven twenty minutes. Serve in the dish in which it was 
baked. 

STUFFED TOMATOES 

Choose large, smooth tomatoes. Cut a slice off the stem 
ends, and with your ringer carefully scoop out the seeds. 
Put one cup of stale bread crumbs into a bowl, add to 
them a teaspoonful of chopped onion, a half-teaspoon ml 
of salt, a dash of cayenne, and moisten with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter. Fill the tomatoes with this stuffing, 
heaping it in the centre. Place the tomatoes in a granite 
baking-pan, and bake in a quick oven thirty minutes. 
When done, take them up carefully with a cake-turner, 
place on a heated dish, and serve. 

This stuffing will fill six tomatoes. 

FRIED TOMATOES No. i 

Wash and cut into halves six nice, smooth tomatoes. Place 
in a granite baking-pan with the skin side down. Cut a 
quarter-pound of butter in small pieces and place over the 
tomatoes, dust with salt and pepper, and stand over a mod- 
erate fire to fry slowly. When the tomatoes are tender, 
take them up carefully with a cake-turner and slide them 
on a heated dish. Draw the baking-pan over a quick fire, stir 
until the butter is a nice brown ; then add two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour; mix until smooth, add a pint of milk or 
cream, stir continually until it boils, season with salt and 
pepper to taste, pour over the tomatoes, and serve. 



VEGETABLES 305 

FRIED TOMATOES No. 2 

Cut smooth, solid tomatoes into slices about an eighth of an 
inch in thickness, dry each slice carefully with a soft towel, 
then dust with salt and pepper. Beat an egg in a saucer 
until light, add to it a tablespoonful of boiling water. Dip 
each slice first in this and then in breajd crumbs. Put two 
or three tablespoon fuls of lard or dripping in a frying-pan ; 
when very hot, cover the bottom of the pan with the slices 
of tomatoes ; fry brown on one side, then turn and brown 
the other. Take them up carefully with a cake-turner, 
place on a heated dish, and keep warm while you fry the 
remainder. 

BROILED TOMATOES 

Choose large, firm tomatoes, cut them in halves, but do 
not peel them. Then place them in a broiler, dust with 
salt and pepper, and broil over a clear but moderate fire, 
skin side down, until tender (about twenty minutes). 
When done, lift them carefully to a heated plate, pour 
melted butter over them, and serve. 

CURRIED TOMATOES 

i quart of stewed tomatoes or one quart can 

i cup of rice 

i teaspoonful of curry powder 

Salt to taste 

Wash the rice through several cold waters. Add the curry 
powder and salt to the tomatoes; mix well. Put a layer 
of the tomatoes in the bottom of a baking-dish, then a 
layer of the uncooked rice, then a layer of tomatoes, and 
so on until all is used, having the last layer tomatoes ; 
sprinkle the top over with bread crumbs, place a few bits 
of butter here and there over the crumbs, and bake in a 
moderate oven for a half-hour. Serve in the dish in which 
it was baked. 



306 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

BOILED TURNIPS 

Wash and pare the turnips, cut them into slices crosswise ; 
put them into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, and 
boil until tender (about thirty minutes). When done, 
drain in a colander, pressing lightly to squeeze out all the 
water ; then mash fine, add butter, salt and pepper to taste, 
and serve. 

Or, mix with an equal quantity of hot mashed potatoes. 

TURNIPS WITH CREAM SAUCE 

Pare six small turnips and cut them into dice ; put into a 
saucepan, cover with boiling water, and boil for thirty 
minutes. When the turnips are nearly done, make a cream 
sauce, and stand over the tea kettle to keep warm. Drain 
the turnips in a colander, turn them carefully into a vege- 
table dish, pour the cream sauce over them, and serve. 

BROWNED TURNIPS 

Pare the turnips, cut in slices crosswise, and boil as directed 
in preceding recipe. Drain' in a colander. Put two table- 
spoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan ; when hot, add the 
turnips and one tablespoonful of granulated sugar ; stir 
and turn carefully until the slices are nicely browned ; dust 
with salt and pepper, and serve. 

These are a nice accompaniment to roast ducks. 

RUTA-BAGA 

Ruta-bagas are much more solid than the common white 
turnips, and may be cooked and served according to the 
recipes given for turnips. 

BOILED TURNIP TOPS OR SPROUTS 
Wash a quarter-peck of turnip tops in cold water; put 
them into a kettle, cover with boiling water, and boil 
twenty minutes ; add a tablespoonful of salt when they are 
half done. Drain in a colander. Serve in a vegetable 
dish, garnished with slices of hard-boiled eggs.

BREAD 



Bread heads the list of foods for man. 

It is said that a slave of an archon at Athens first made 
leaven bread by accident. He forgot some of his dough, 
and, some days after, came upon it and found it sour. His 
first thoughts were to throw it away; but, his master coming 
out, he mixed it quickly with some fresh dough he was 
working. Of course the bread this produced was delicious: 

Bread is mostly made from wheat, as that grain contains 
more gluten in the proper proportion to make a light and 
spongy bread, which will allow the juices of the stomach 
to have access to every part, and digestion in all parts is 
commenced immediately. 

Please note under the head of cereals the chemical 
composition of wheat, and you will see at once that our 
fine white bread contains little but starch. We cannot say 
that such bread is the "staff of life," but the brown (not 
bran), whole wheat bread constitutes, in itself, a complete 
life-sustainer ; consequently, bread-making is the most im- 
portant of the cookery of grain food. 

The grinding is the first process of this cookery, and 
is performed in several ways, each one claiming superiority. 
One is by grinding the grain between two horizontal stones, 
the upper revolving and grinding the grain against the lower 



312 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

one, which is stationary. In this way the bran or outer 
husk is simply separated from the grain ; the gluten is di- 
vided minutely, while the starch or white part of the grain 
is finely powdered. It is then sifted through bolting-cloth, 
and makes our fine white flour, coarse wheat meal, and bran. 
The flour containing little or no bran is most easily digested. 
Another method is the Minnesota or "patent process." 
In this way the grain is crushed (not ground) by passing 
through corrugated rollers, and then sifted through bolting- 
cloths. Still another is the new patent or Haxall process. 
By this method the flour is granulated, and contains much 
more gluten than either of the others ; consequently, one- 
eighth less may be used in all recipes for bread, biscuit, or 
cakes. 

The fancy names given to flour amount to very little, 
as the same flour is sold by several dealers under their own 
and different brands. 

Good flour adheres to the hand, and, when pressed 
tightly, remains in shape, and shows the imprint of the 
lines of the skin on the hand. It has a yellowish-white 
tinge, and, when made into a paste with water, and well 
worked, is tough and elastic. Select it carefully, and use 
one kind for all purposes cakes, pastry, and bread. It 
is a mistaken idea that the flour which makes good bread 
will not make good pastry. After selecting the flour, the 
next important thing is to have good, strong, sweet yeast. 
Potato yeast is the best, as the potato starch is particularly 
adapted to the yeast fermentation. The compressed cakes, 
however, are very good and convenient, one cake being equal 
to one cup of good yeast. Yeast is a plant, and a very deli- 
cate one, that does not flourish under extreme heat or cold ; 
therefore, you must be very choice in the selection of the 
place where the bread shall stand to ferment. If chilled, 
it is spoiled ; if scalded, it is killed, and nothing can restore 



BREAD 313 

it. An even temperature, from 68 to 72, is best. In 
warm weather, take the liquid cool ; in winter blood-warm. 

As dough contains both sugar and gluten, when moist- 
ened and subjected to a temperature of 106 to 108 for 
six hours, it is capable of fermentation ; then, by adding 
more moisture and flour, and fermenting again, then baking, 
you have salt-rising, or milk-emptyings bread, a sweet, fine, 
and delicious bread. 

There are various ways of making bread with milk, 
water, potatoes, etc. ; but the two points, sweetness and 
lightness, remain always the chief consideration. If milk 
is used, it should be scalded and cooled ; this prevents its 
souring. Next comes the mixing or sponging of the bread ; 
that is, surrounding each grain of flour with a film of water, 
to combine and hydrate the starch, to dissolve the sugar 
and albumen, and to moisten the gluten, which causes them 
to adhere and form a dough. This is not, then, a mere 
mixture, but an actual chemical combination; but, as we can- 
not use water enough to alone effect this, it must be supple- 
mented by kneading, and here comes our most important 
point. So far, this has been best accomplished by the hands ; 
all machines made for the purpose, that have come under 
my observation, have been failures. As the eye cannot pen- 
etrate into the centre of the dough to discover the lumps, 
etc., we have no guide except the sense of touch. The ex- 
cellency of bread depends much upon the thoroughness of 
its kneading. First work the dough in the pan until.it 
loses part of its stickiness ; then thickly flour the board, 
flour the hands, take out the dough, and knead rapidly and 
continuously by drawing the dough farthest from you over 
to the centre, and pressing it down with the ball of the 
hand. Repeat this several times, then turn the dough 
around and knead the other side, and so on, until every 
part is thoroughly and evenly kneaded. This will take about 



314 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

fifteen or twenty minutes. When you first begin, the dough 
will be soft and sticky, but will become less so the longer 
you knead, and, when you can knead it on an unfloured, 
dry board, the kneading may be discontinued. 

Kneading renders the gluten so elastic that the dough 
is capable of expanding to twice its bulk without breaking 
or cracking. After this, you stand it away to rise. Give it 
time to fully expand, but be careful that the dough does 
not fall, as it is then sour, and nothing can be added to re- 
store the original sweetness. Soda is sometimes used, but 
does not accomplish the object. This falling or souring is 
caused by the yeast consuming or eating up every atom of 
flour. If a handful of flour be added to the dough, and 
the dough then pressed down, it might stand, then, perhaps 
another hour, or until this flour is consumed, without souring. 

Next comes the moulding. After this dough is very 
light, divide it carefully into loaves ; knead lightly on the 
board until formed ; place each one in its own pan (the 
best pans are made from sheet iron, eight inches long, four 
wide, and four deep), and stand back in a warm place until 
double its bulk. 

Now comes the baking, which is equally important. 
There are several ways of testing the oven without a ther- 
mometer. One is the baker's method ; he throws flour on 
the floor of the oven ; if it browns quickly, without taking 
fire, the heat is sufficient, or if you can hold your hand in 
the oven while you count twenty slowly, it is right ; or, if 
you use a thermometer, 360. The bread should be in the 
oven ten minutes before it begins to brown. 

If the oven be too hot, a thick crust is produced, 
forming a non-conducting covering to the loaf, which pre- 
vents the heat from penetrating to the interior ; hence, the 
burnt loaf is always unbaked in the centre, and the dex- 
trine is changed into caramel, thus making the crust bitter 



BREAD 315 

instead of sweet. Bake in single pans, three-quarters of an 
hour. When done, remove it immediately from the pan, 
and tip against a plate or bread board, so that the air will 
circulate freely around it. Do not cover, if you like a 
crisp, sweet crust. When perfectly cold, put it into a 
sweet, clean, tin bread box, without any wrapping, as the 
cloth absorbs the moisture, and very soon sours and moulds, 
destroying the flavor of the bread. 

YEAST No. i 

Pare four good-sized potatoes, and let them lie in cold 
water for a half-hour. Put one quart of boiling water in a 
saucepan. Now grate the potatoes quickly and stir them 
into the boiling water ; stir over the fire for five minutes, 
then take from the fire, add a half-cupful of sugar, and 
two tablespoon fuls of salt, turn into a stone jar or bowl, 
and let stand until lukewarm; then add one cupful of good 
yeast, cover and ferment three or four hours ; stir it down 
every time it comes to the top of the vessel ; then put it 
into a jar or large bottle, or something you can cover tightly, 
and stand it in a place where it will keep very cold, but not 
freeze. It will keep two weeks. Save one cupful of this 
yeast to start with next time. 

This is the simplest and best yeast that can be made. 

YEAST No. 2 

Pare and boil four good-sized potatoes ; when done, mash 
them fine. Put a half-cupful of dried hops into one quart 
of water, and boil fifteen minutes. Put one pint of flour 
into a bowl, strain over it the boiling hop water, add the 
mashed potatoes, and beat until smooth ; then add a half- 
cup of sugar, and two heaping tablespoonfuls of salt, and 
finish the same as Yeast No. i. 



316 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

FRENCH BREAD 

i quart of water 6 hop flowers 

i pound of potatoes i tablespoonful of salt 

i cup of good yeast or half a compressed cake 
About four quarts of flour 

Put the hops in the water, and boil five minutes. Boil the 
potatoes in their skins ; when done, peel and mash them 
fine. Put three cups of flour into the bread pan, pour one 
pint of boiling water over it, and beat quickly until smooth; 
add the mashed potatoes, and then strain into this the hop- 
water ; add the salt and a teaspoonful of sugar ; beat 
thoroughly; and, when lukewarm, add the yeast ; stand in a- 
warm place for nine hours, or over night. In the morning 
add sufficient flour (about three and a half quarts) to make 
a dough; knead thoroughly and continuously for ten 
minutes, using as little flour as possible ; then wet the 
hands in lukewarm water, raise the dough about three feet 
from the board, and throw it back with force, and continue 
this process for fifteen minutes, or until large air bubbles 
are formed in the dough. If properly worked the dough 
will be very elastic and soft, but will not stick to the hands. 
Now put it back in the bread pan, cover, and stand in a 
warm place to rise, about two hours. When light, take 
out gently, enough of this dough to make one loaf (about 
a pound) ; sprinkle the board lightly with flour, knead so 
as to make a kind of ball ; then roll it gently with palms 
of the hands, giving it an elongated shape ; now flour a 
rolling-pin lightly, place it on top of the loaf, right in the 
centre, and press and roll a little to make a furrow in the 
middle of the loaf. Now dust a towel or bread cloth well 
with flour, place the loaf just made upside down on the 
towel, pulling out the ends a little to give the loaf a long 
form, and so continue until all the loaves arc made ; then 
cover with a towel, let rise as ordinary bread ; then turn 



BREAD 317 

into floured bread pans, the furrowed side up, /. e. t the side 
that was down in the floured towel must be up in the bak- 
ing-pan. The loaves must be a little distance apart, if you 
place two in one pan. Sprinkle plenty of flour on the top 
of each loaf, and bake in a moderately quick oven, forty 
minutes. 

MILK BREAD 

1 pint of milk About two quarts of flour 
YZ cup of yeast or half a i teaspoonful of salt 

compressed cake i teaspoonful of butter 
Scald the milk and turn it into the bread pan, add the 
butter and salt. When cool, add the yeast, and sufficient 
flour to make a thick batter. Beat thoroughly until 
the batter is full of air-bubbles. Cover, and let stand in a 
warm place (72 Fahr.) until morning. Early in the 
morning add enough flour to make a dough. Take it out 
on a baking-board as soon as it is stiff enough to do so, 
and knead quickly and gently until the dough is perfectly 
smooth and elastic, and will not stick to the board or hands. 
Now put it back in the bread pan, cover, and stand in the 
same warm place, and let it rise until it doubles its bulk. 
When light, turn out on the board, divide it into halves, 
mould lightly into loaves, put them into greased pans, and 
stand away again until light. Bake in a moderately quick 
oven (390 Fahr.) for three-quarters of an hour. 

WATER BREAD 

Water bread is made precisely the same as Milk Bread, 
using tepid water instead of milk. 

MILK BREAD WITH POTATO SPONGE 

2 potatoes i quart of milk 

i tablespoonful of salt i cup of yeast or half a 
About four quarts of flour compressed cake 

Pare the potatoes, put them in a saucepan with a quart of 



318 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

boiling water, and boil until very tender. Put one cup of 
flour in the bread pan, pour over it one cup of the boiling 
potato water, beat quickly ; mash the potatoes through a 
colander into this batter, and beat again until smooth. 
When lukewarm, add the yeast and salt ; mix, cover, and 
stand in a warm place (72 Fahr.) over night. In the 
morning scald the milk; and, when lukewarm, add to it 
sufficient flour to make a batter; then add the potato sponge, 
mix well, cover, and stand away in a warm place until very 
light. Then add sufficient flour to make a dough. Take 
it out on a baking-board as soon as it is stiff enough to do 
so, and knead quickly and gently until the dough is per- 
fectly smooth and elastic, and will not stick to the board 
or hands; then cut it into quarters, mould into loaves, 
place each loaf in a greased bread pan, cover with a towel, 
and stand in a warm place to rise, until it doubles its bulk. 
Then bake in a moderately quick oven (390 Fahr.) for 
three-quarters of an hour. 

STIRRED BREAD 

Make a sponge the same as for Milk Bread, and let it stand 
over night. In the morning, beat it well, add one cup of 
flour, and pour it into greased, deep bread pans. Let it 
stand until light (about two hours). Bake in a moderately 
quick oven for three-quarters of an hour. 

This makes a very sweet bread, but is not so delicate 
as when kneaded. 

SALT-RISING BREAD 

Add to one pint of scalding water sufficient flour to make a 
thick batter, add a half-teaspoonful of salt, and beat until 
smooth and full of air-bubbles. Cover closely, stand in a 
pan of warm water and keep in a warm place over night. 
In the morning, scald one pint of milk, stand aside until 



BREAD 319 

lukewarm ; add a teaspoon ful of salt and enough flour to 
make a batter that will drop, not pour, from a spoon. 
Now turn into this the salt rising, which should be very 
light, and emit a very unpleasant odor; beat thoroughly 
and continuously for three minutes, then cover with a towel, 
stand in a pan of warm water, and put where it will keep 
warm until very light (about two hours) ; then add sufficient 
flour to make a dough ; knead thoroughly and continuously 
until smooth and elastic, divide into loaves, mould, place 
in greased pans, cover with a towel, and, when very light, 
bake in a moderate oven (300 Fahr.) one hour. 

This must be kept very much warmer than a yeast 
bread, or it will not rise. It is thought by some more 
digestible than any other kind of bread. 

SWEET POTATO BREAD 

i quart of flour i pint of warm water 

4 roasted sweet potatoes i cup of yeast or half a 
i tablespoonful of salt compressed cake 

i tablespoonful of butter 

Put the water into a bread pan or large bowl, add the but- 
ter, salt, yeast and flour ; beat well, and stand in a warm 
place over night. In the morning, bake the potatoes and 
press them through a sieve into the light sponge, add flour, 
and finish same as Milk Bread. 

RYE BREAD 

Make a sponge from wheat flour as directed in recipe for 
Milk Bread. In the morning add sufficient rye flour to 
make a soft dough. Knead lightly; then cut the dough in 
two loaves, mould, place in greased bread pans, cover and 
stand in a warm place to rise again. When light, bake in 
a moderate oven (300 Fahr.) for one hour. 

Rye bread must not be as stiff as white bread,, and does 
not require so much kneading.

Sufficient flour to make a dough 

Pare the potatoes, put them in a saucepan with a quart of 
boiling water, and boil until very tender. Put one cup of 
flour in the bread pan, pour over it one cup of the boiling 
potato water, beat quickly. Mash the potatoes through a 
colander into this batter, beat again until smooth, and let 
stand until lukewarm ; then add the yeast and the salt, mix 
well; cover and stand in a warm place (72 Fahr.) over 
night. Now put the corn meal in a bowl and pour over it 
just sufficient boiling water to moisten it ; let it stand also 
over night. In the morning, scald the milk and stand 
aside until lukewarm; then add sufficient flour to make a 
batter that will drop, not pour, from a spoon ; now add .to 
this the scalded corn meal, then the potato mixture; 
beat all well together, then add sufficient flour to make a 
soft dough; knead lightly, using just enough flour to pre- 
vent sticking; then divide in fourths. Mould each fourth 
into a loaf, place each loaf in a greased bread pan, cover 
and stand in a warm place until light, then bake in a 
moderate oven (300 Fahr.) for one and a quarter hours.

then bake in a moderately quick oven (390 Fahr.) for 
forty minutes. 

GRAHAM BREAD 

Make a sponge at night as directed in recipe for Milk or 
Water Bread. In the morning add two large tablespoon- 
fuls of molasses and sufficient Graham flour to make a soft 
dough. Work well with the hand, mould into loaves, put 
into well-greased pans, let it rise again, and bake in a 
moderate oven (300 Fahr.) for one hour. 

Graham bread must be watched more carefully than 
white bread, as it sours quickly.

MARYLAND BISCUIT 
i quart of flour i teaspoonful of salt 

i large tablespoon ful of lard 

Add the salt to the flour, then rub the lard thoroughly into 
it with the hands. Put a half-pint of milk and a half-pint 
of water into a pitcher, add it gradually to the flour, stir- 
ring and kneading all the while add just enough to 
moisten the flour, for the dough should be very stiff; knead 
five minutes, and beat with an axe thirty minutes. Then 
form into small round biscuits, stick with a fork here and 
there over the surface, and bake in a moderately quick 
oven about twenty or twenty-five minutes. They should 
be browned on top and the sides almost white. 

They should be as white as the driven snow inside, 
with a slight crack around the sides.

PLAIN FRITTERS 

Beat two eggs together until light, add to them one cup of 
milk, a half-teaspoonful of salt, and sufficient flour to make 
a thin batter that will pour from a spoon. Beat until 
smooth. Have ready a deep pan of hot fat; add two 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder to the batter, mix thor- 
oughly, and drop by spoonfuls into the hot fat. When 
brown on one side, turn and brown on the other ; take out 
with a skimmer, and serve very hot. Do not pierce them 
with a fork, as it allows the steam to escape and makes the 
fritter heavy. 

FRENCH FRITTERS 

1 cup of flour 

YI cup of cold water 

2 eggs 

i tablespoonful of olive oil 
YL teaspoonful of salt 

Put the flour into a bowl ; beat the y6lks of the eggs, add 
the cold water and stir this gradually into the flour ; now 
add more water, if necessary, and give a good, vigorous 
beating. Add salt and oil, and then stir in the whites of 
the eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and put away for at least 
two hours, but not longer than twelve hours. Put a pan 
of dripping or oil on to heat; when hot (360 Fahr.), dip 
up a spoonful of the batter, and quickly slide it into the 
fat ; when brown on one side turn and brown on the other. 
When done, take out with a skimmer, drain on soft, brown 
paper, dredge with powdered sugar, and serve. 

Fruit fritters are made by dipping the fruit into this 
batter and then frying.

the size of a hickory-nut. As you make each ball, drop it 
into the boiling fat, fry and turn until they have swollen 
the size of an egg. When done, take out carefully with 
a skimmer, drain, dust with powdered sugar, and stand 
one side to cool. When cold, split one side with a sharp 
knife, put a teaspoonful of the filling into the fritter, close, 
and so continue until all are filled. Serve cold. 

DOUGHNUTS 

i pint of milk 
y z cup of sugar 
Flour sufficient to make a soft dough 

3 e gg s 

1 teaspoonful of salt 

Y^ cup of yeast or half a compressed cake 

2 ounces of butter 

Scald the milk, add to it the butter and stand one side 
to cool. When cool, add the yeast, sugar and flour ; beat 
thoroughly, cover, and stand in a moderately warm place 
over night. In the morning, beat the eggs until light, stir 
them into the batter ; then add sufficient flour to make a 
a soft dough, knead lightly, cover, and stand away until 
light. When light, take out about half the dough, roll 
it out on a baking-board, cut into doughnuts with a large, 
round cutter ; then with a small cutter make a hole in the 
centre. Spread a clean bread-cloth over the kitchen table, 
dust it lightly with flour, place the doughnuts on this, cover, 
and let stand a half-hour. Then have ready a deep kettle 
of boiling fat (suet best). Put the doughnuts into this fat 
upside down (i. e. , the side that was up on the table should 



344 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

go down in the fat). In standing, a crust forms on the 
surface, which prevents the doughnuts from becoming light 
if they are placed in the fat with this crust uppermost. 
Fry on one side, then turn by slipping a fork through the 
hole in the centre ; do not stick it into the doughnut. 
When done, drain, and dust with powdered sugar. 



BREAD DOUGHNUTS 

Take one pint of bread dough, when you are moulding it 
for the pans, add to it two ounces of lard or butter, which 
cut and work with a knife into the dough, adding flour to 
prevent it sticking to the board. When soft and elastic, 
place it in a bowl, cover, and stand in a warm place until 
very light. When light, roll out and finish the same as 
preceding recipe. 

CRULLERS 

2 ounces of butter 

2 eggs 

4 heaping tablespoon fuls of sugar 
^ of a nutmeg, grated 

Sufficient flour to make a dough 

Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, then add the yolks 
of the eggs and nutmeg ; beat again until light ; then add 
the well-beaten whites, and sufficient flour, gradually, to 
make a dough that will roll out on the board. Roll the 
dough out into a sheet a quarter-inch thick, cut into pieces 
about two inches square ; now make five incisions, cutting 
to within one-third of an inch at either end ; take up every 
other strip ; fold them in the middle and drop them quickly 
into boiling fat. When brown, drain, dust with powdered 
sugar, and stand away to cool.

y?. teaspoonful of salt i heaping teaspoonful of 

i teaspoonful of vanilla baking-powder 

Beat the eggs until light ; then add the sugar ; beat again ; 
add the sour cream ; mix ; add the vanilla and salt. Put 
the baking-powder into the sifted flour and sift again ; now 
add this to the other ingredients, mix, roll out on a board, 
cut with a large, round cutter ; then with a small cutter 
take out the centres. Drop them quickly into boiling fat, 
brown on one side, turn and brown on the other. When 
done, drain, and dust with powdered sugar. 

To have these a perfect success, the dough must be as 
soft as you can possibly handle it. 



FRENCH CRULLERS 

4 ounces of flour 2 ounces of butter 

1/2, pint of water 4 eggs 

Cut the butter into small pieces, put it into the water, and 
stand over a good fire to boil ; as soon as it boils, add the 
flour quickly, and stir over the fire until it sticks together 
and rolls around in the saucepan like a ball. Then take it 
from the fire, beat thoroughly, and stand in a warm place 
(72 Fahr.) for a half-hour. Then add one egg unbeaten, 
and beat the mixture until smooth ; then add another 
egg, and beat again, and so continue until you have 
added the four eggs ; then beat the mixture for five min- 
utes, cover, and stand to one side for another half-hour. 
Put one pound of lard or clarified dripping into a deep fry- 
ing-pan, stand it on the fire to gradually heat. Put one cup 
of powdered sugar on a dinner plate, add to it one tea- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon ; mix. Now flour the baking- 



346 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

board, put out a tablespoon ful of the mixture, and roll very 
lightly. The mixture will be very soft, but a little practice 
will enable you to handle it without adding much flour. 
After rolling the mixture down to a quarter of an inch, cut 
with a round cutter, then take out a centre with a small 
cutter, lift carefully with a cake-turner, and slide into the 
hot fat. Fry brown on one side, turn and brown on the 
other. Take out, drain, then roll in the sugar and cinna- 
mon. 

These are very troublesome to make, but, when well 
done, are most delicious. 

Points to be remembered : 

1. After adding the last egg, let the beating be rapid 
and continuous. 

2. Have the fat hot, but not smoking hot. 

3. Use very little extra flour in rolling out.

CEREALS 



WHEAT 

We begin with wheat, which, on account of its nutritive 
value, and the universality of its consumption, is placed at 
the head of all cereals. The whole wheat grain constitutes 
a perfect food. It consists of starch, gluten, sugar, gum, 
fatty matter, husk, water, and salts (potash, soda, lime, 
magnesia, phosphoric acid, etc.). 

Wheat has several layers of bran coats. The outer 
coat, or true bran, contains silica and some other elements 
not found elsewhere in the grain, but is composed mostly 
of woody fibre. When flour is unbolted (the bran not 
separated), it is slightly increased in nutritive value, but at 
the expense of digestibility ; consequently, bread contain- 
ing bran should be rejected by persons of weak digestion. 

Underneath the bran husk is a layer of rather darkish 
matter, the gluten cells surrounded by diffused gluten, con- 
taining the phosphates, other mineral matters, and the fatty 
matter, which are bound in by the true bran. This internal 
layer also contains cerealine. Beneath this are the cells 
which form the central mass, composed chiefly of starch, 
with a very little albumen and gluten. This part crumbles 
easily to a fine dust, and forms cur fine white flour. By 

this division it is seen that the brain, bone, and muscle- 

(350 



352 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

feeding elements lie just beneath the true bran, the heat 
and force-producing elements in the central mass. 

Wheat grown in different climates and soils, in wet 
and dry seasons, contains different proportions of gluten. 
The gluten of wheat is a gray, elastic, tough substance. 
If you make a dough of flour and water, and work it 
on a cloth drawn over a sieve, under a stream of water, 
you wash away the starch, and have remaining this gray, 
elastic sheet, closely resembling a soiled chamois skin. Now 
dry it, and you have a substance glue-like in appearance, 
hence its name, "gluten." This gluten consists chiefly of 
vegetable fibrin. Flour-dealers and bakers determine the 
quality of flour by the gluten it contains the more the 
the better. Good flour should furnish sufficient gluten to 
to enable the bread, after a thorough kneading, to swell 
three times its original bulk ; while the flour containing 
little gluten is soft and sticky, and, even after long kneading, 
produces a soft, flat, and watery bread. Bread cannot be 
made from pure gluten. 

The Health Food Company make a most delicious 
bread, which they call " gluten bread," but it also contains 
starch. 

Macaroni and vermicelli are made from gluten pastes. 
Wheat grown in warm climates abounds most in gluten, con- 
sequently our best macaroni comes from Italy. 

Whole wheat grains, under the name of "cracked 
wheat," are frequently and wisely used as an article of diet. 
This should be boiled in a double boiler until the envelope 
of the grain is burst open (about three or four hours, or over 
night, on the back part of the fire), then eaten warm with 
sugar, salt, and cream. (See Suitable Combinations of 
Food.) 

FARINA 

This is an excellent preparation, made from wheat, in a 



CEREALS 353 

form generally acceptable to delicate stomachs. As it con- 
tains nitrogenous matter, it is superior in nutritive value to 
corn-starch or arrowroot as food for children. It is also 
excellent food for adults. It may be used by those who 
find grits or cracked wheat too irritating. 

RYE 

This cereal ranks next to wheat in nutritive qualities. It 
contains more sugar and less gluten than wheat, conse- 
quently has more heat-producing and less muscle and 
brain -feed ing elements. It contains more waste material, 
therefore it is more stimulating to the intestinal canal. It 
makes a good winter, but poor summer, bread. 

BARLEY 

This grain is used mostly for malting purposes. It is less 
nutritive than wheat, but is more easily digested, and 
produces a decoction well adapted to persons of weak 
digestion. 

OATS 

This grain is not used to any great extent as an article of 
diet for man in this country Oatmeal stands at the head 
of all other grains in point of flesh -producing, force-pro- 
ducing, and nutritive power, containing the largest pro- 
portion of nitrogenous matter, and furnishes the most ma- 
terial for hard work. The nitrogenous matter of oatmeal 
resembles casein (the nitrogenous matter of milk) more 
than gluten. It, like cracked wheat, should be boiled for 
hours, or it forms a most indigestible food for persons of 
sedentary habits. 

CORN 

This grain contains more heat-producing and fat-forming 
elements than wheat ; consequently, corn meal is best 
adapted for a winter diet. It contains more than six times 
as much oil as wheat. It is not glutinous, and hence will 



354 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

not make a dough or fermented bread unless mixed with a 
larger quantity of wheat flour. In consequence of the ex- 
cess of oily matter contained in corn meal, it attracts much 
oxygen from the atmosphere, and is very prone to change ; 
it will not keep long. This quality is also wonderfully 
shown in green corn. It changes and loses its flavor 
almost as soon as picked. It is very important that corn 
and corn -meal mush be well cooked. 

HOMINY 

This is Indian corn divested of its germ and outside skin, 
the grain being left nearly whole. 

SAMP OR BREAKFAST HOMINY 

Each grain is hulled and broken up into a number of small 
pieces. 

HULLED CORN 

This is corn soaked in an alkali to remove the hull. In 
this way much of the oil is lost, and it therefore makes a 
good summer food. 

RICE 

Rice is richest in starch, and most deficient in oil, of all 
the cereals. It is the most digestible of vegetable foods. 
Its nutritive value, however, is not equal to wheat, because 
it is chiefly starch. 

BUCKWHEAT 

This grain is inferior to wheat in nutritive value, containing 
more heat-producing food, and not half the muscle or 
brain-food. Eaten alone, therefore, it is valueless as food. 

CRACKED WHEAT

stand it on the back part of the fire over night. In the 
morning, stand it over a hot fire, and let it boil one hour 
without stirring. Then turn out carefully, so as not to 
break the grains. Serve with cream. 

HULLED CORN (Mrs. Adams) 

Put two handfuls of clean hard-wood ashes in two quarts 
of cold water; boil fifteen or twenty minutes; let stand 
until the ashes settle and the water is perfectly clear. To 
this cleansed water (it should be strong enough of the lye 
to feel a little slippery), add as much cold water as is neces- 
sary to cover the corn. Put the corn in the water; let it 
boil until the hulls begin to start, then skim the corn out 
into a pan of clear, cold water, and rub thoroughly with 



356 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

the hands, to remove the hulls and cleanse the corn from 
the lye, rub it through two or three, or even four, waters, 
that there maybe no taste of lye; then put into clear water 
and boil until tender. 

BOILED RICE 

Wash one cup of rice. Put three quarts of boiling water 
into a kettle, add a teaspoonful of salt, and let it boil 
rapidly ; sprinkle in the rice so gradually that you will not 
stop the boiling. When you have it all in, give the water 
a twirl with a fork, cover the kettle, and boil rapidly 
twenty minutes. Then pour into a colander to drain. 
Place the colander on a tin dish ; stand it in the oven 
for five minutes, to dry, leaving the door wide open ; then 
turn it carefully into a heated dish. Serve without a cover. 
Points to be remembered : Boil rapidly from the time 
you cover the kettle till you take it off. The rapid boiling 
allows each grain to swell three times its normal size, and 
the motion prevents the grains from sticking together. 
Do not stir it, as this will cause it to fall to the bottom of 
the kettle, and burn. The drying in the oven with the 
door open evaporates the moisture, leaving the rice soft, 
snowy white, and perfectly dry. 

TO MAKE A RICE BORDER 

Wash one cup of rice in cold water, and drain it. Put it 
in a saucepan with one quart of boiling stock. Boil rapidly 
for fifteen minutes, then stand it over a very moderate fire 
to steam (not boil) for twenty minutes longer; drain, 
season with salt and black pepper, and press into a well- 
buttered border mould. Then put it in the oven and bake 
fifteen minutes. Take out ; place a dish on the mould ; 
turn it upside down, and remove the mould. 

The hollow space in the centre may be filled with a 
white or brown fricassee of chicken or a curry.

MACARONI 



Macaroni, as an article of food, is rather more valuable 
than bread, as it contains a larger proportion of gluten. 
It is the bread of the Italian laborer. In this country, it is 
a sort of a luxury among the upper classes; but there is no 
good reason, considering its price, why it should not enter 
more extensively into the food of our working classes. 

In selecting, choose that of a brownish color, rather 
than the pure white. 

Spighetti is the most delicate form of macaroni that 
comes to this country.

add a teaspoonful of salt, and boil rapidly twenty-five min- 
utes (the rapid boiling prevents the macaroni from sticking 
together) ; drain in a colander ; then throw into cold water

tinue until all is used, having the last layer macaroni. Cut 
the butter in small bits ; distribute them evenly over the 
top; add the cream and bake until a golden brown (about 
twenty minutes) in a moderately quick oven. Serve in the 
dish in which it was baked. 

CREAM MACARONI 
(Mrs. S. W. R. Williams, of Philadelphia) 
For a dish holding three pints, one-half pound of spighetti 
will be required. Have ready a kettle full of boiling salted 
water. Take the spighetti all up together, in the long 
sticks, without breaking. Hold the ends in the boiling 
water; in an instant it will go down into the water. Whirl 
it round and round with a fork to thoroughly separate it, 
then allow it to boil hard for twenty minutes. When done, 
put it in a colander, and pour cold water through it (this 
is called blanching). After it is drained, put it into the 
dish in which it is to be baked. 

FOR THE CREAM GRAVY 

Put one and one-half pints of milk on to boil in a double 
boiler. While it is boiling, stir smoothly together three 



360 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

tablespoon fuls of flour and three scant tablespoonfuls of 
butter. When smooth, stir carefully into the boiling milk, 
and continue stirring for a few moments until it thickens. 
Then stir into it three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. 
Parmesan is best, but any strong cheese will answer. Pour 
it over the macaroni in the dish, sprinkle a little more 
cheese over the top, and put in the oven to brown. The 
macaroni may be boiled and arranged in the dish; the cream 
gravy made, all but adding the cheese, and put in a covered 
saucepan in the bain-marie to keep hot; do not put them 
together until just as you are ready to put them into the 
oven, as the cream will curdle if allowed to stand on the 
macaroni. If yxm do not chance to have a silver baking- 
dish, fold a napkin cornerwise and over and over until it 
is the proper width for your dish, then fasten it around the 
dish ; stand the dish in a pretty plate before sending it to 
the table.

i teaspoonful of mushroom catsup 

1 teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce 

2 ounces of macaroni boiled and cut in 

pieces one inch long. 

Mix the crumbs and meat well together; then add the 
stock, seasoning and sauces; mix, and add the egg, well 
beaten. Grease a plain pudding mould, and line it with 
the boiled macaroni; fill with the mixture, and press in 
compactly. Put the lid on the mould and fasten it. Then 
stand the mould in a kettle, with sufficient boiling water 
to about two-thirds cover it. Now put the lid on the kettle, 
and boil for one hour. When done, turn it from the 
mould, pour Cream Sauce around it, and serve. 



CHEESE AND NOODLES 



Cheese may be regarded as our most concentrated food. 
It contains almost twice as much nutriment as any other 
known substance. Being difficult of digestion, it should 
be taken only in small quantities. Old cheese, being in a 
state of decomposition, taken after a hearty meal, mingling 
with the contents of the stomach, will aid digestion by 
exciting fermentation. 

Cooked or melted cheese forms a most valuable and 
nutritious food, and is much more easily digested than when 
eaten raw. Mattieu Williams says : " I regard it as the 
most important of all that I have to describe in connection 
with my subject the 'Science of Cookery.' Its cookery is 
singularly neglected is practically an unknown art espe- 
cially in this country ; and all that is required to render it, 
next to bread, the staple food of Britons, is scientific 
cookery."

364 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

cheese, mustard, pepper, cayenne and nutmeg ; rub the 
butter and flour together and add that. Heat this care- 
fully until the cheese is dissolved. Then beat the eggs, 
yolks and whites together, and add them to this solution of 
cheese, stirring the whole. Now take a shallow metal or 
earthenware dish or tray, that will bear heating, and put a 
little butter on it, and heat the butter until it frizzles. 
Then pour the mixture into the tray, and bake or fry until 
nearly solidified. 

TOASTED CHEESE OR SCOTCH RARE-BIT 

y<z pound of rich cheese 4 slices of bread 

Salt and cayenne to taste 

Cut the cheese into very thin slices, spread it on a heated 
flat dish, and stand it over boiling water to melt. While 
this is melting, toast the bread, and butter it ; place it on 
a hot dish, add the seasoning to the cheese, and spread it 
over the toast. Serve very hot. 

WELSH RARE-BIT 

2 cups of grated cheese j^ cup of milk 

Yolks of two eggs Salt and cayenne to taste 

Toast carefully square slices of bread with the crusts re- 
moved ; while hot, butter them, and then plunge in a bowl 
of hot water. Place on a heated dish and stand in the 
oven to keep warm while you make the rare-bit. Put the 
milk into a porcelain-lined or granite saucepan ; stand it 
over a moderate fire ; when boiling hot, add the cheese ; 
stir continually until the cheese is melted ; add the salt, 
cayenne and yolks, and pour it over the toasted bread. 

If the rare-bit is stringy and tough, it is the fault of 
the cheese not being rich enough to melt. 

Old English dairy cheese makes the best Welsh rare-bit.

CHEESE FINGERS 

Roll out puff paste into a thin sheet ; brush it over lightly 
with ice-water, cut into strips about five inches long and a 
half-inch wide ; sprinkle over them grated cheese, put one 
strip over the other, lay on a greased tin sheet, and bake in 
a quick oven fifteen minutes.

Mix the flour, cayenne, salt and cheese together, and 
moisten with the egg ; work all into a smooth paste. Roll 
out on a board, one-eighth of an inch thick, five inches 
wide, and five inches long. Cut some of the paste in 
small rings, and some in strips of one-eighth of an inch 
wide. Place both on greased sheets and bake ten minutes 
in an oven (240 Fahr.) till a light brown. Put the straws 
through the rings like a bundle of sticks.

SCHMIER-KASE 

This is made from clabbered milk. After taking the cream 
from the top of a pan of thick, sour milk, stand the pan 
on the back part of the range, and pour over it about three 
quarts of boiling water ; then turn the whole into a bag 
to drain. Hang it in a cool place over night. When ready 
to use, mix and beat it until light ; add salt, pepper and 
sufficient sweet cream to make it the proper consistency. 
Serve very cold. This is also called cottage-cheese. 

CREAM CHEESE WITH NOODLES 

Put two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour in z. plate. Make a 
well in the center, put into it the yolks of two eggs and a 
quarter- teaspoonful of salt. Mix the flour gradually into 
the yolks. Work until the dough thus produced is perfectly 
free from stickiness; now roll it out into a very thin sheet, 
place it on a napkin, and hang in the air a minute to dry ; 
then roll tightly and cut into fine noodles; shake out again 
to dry. When dry, cover with boiling water ; add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and boil fifteen minutes. Drain, turn in a 
hot dish, and pour over a Welsh Rare-bit (page 364). 



TO COOKS 



On first going into a new family, make friends with the 
other servants, as they will acquaint you with the customs 
of the house. Be especially kind to the waitress or waiter, as 
from either you can find out how your dishes are received 
in the dining-room, and this will enable you to rectify many 
mistakes and learn the peculiar family tastes; that is, 
whether or not they like onion, cayenne, or much sugar, 
and many other small points that will greatly assist you, 
and, as you are not cooking to suit your own taste, but that 
of your employers, study well these small points. Give 
your whole time and attention to your work. Make the 
most simple dish appetizing and nutritious. 

Save all materials left over from meals, as they will 
help to make a little side dish for to-morrow's breakfast or 
luncheon. 

Have regular days for each kind of work. Keep every- 
thing in its proper place, which should be a convenient one, 
selected by yourself, and remember that no matter how 
great the hurry, it requires no more time to put things 
back in their proper places than to stand them down hap- 
hazard. 

Study the draughts of your range. Keep in mind that 

a red top always indicates a cool oven. Close the damp- 

(367) 



368 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

ers, and this will throw the heat around the oven. Pull the 
dampers out only when you wish the heat or gas to escape 
into the chimney. " Fix " your fire as soon as breakfast 
is over. Open the draughts and dust damper, rake the 
fire well, until free from every particle of ashes; then 
open the top and brush the soot and the small pieces of 
coal, if any, from the top of the oven into the fire. See 
that the corners are free from ashes, and fill the fire-box 
even full with coal ; that is, just to the tops of the fire- 
bricks, and close the dust damper. If you add more coal 
than this, you cut off the upper draught, and, of course, 
lose much heat. Now clean out the ashes, and carry them 
away. Dust the range or stove, and polish it while cool. 
A paint-brush makes a very nice brush for putting on the 
polish. Watch the fire carefully, allowing it to burn 
briskly until the blue flames appear on the surface, and 
then, if you are not going to use it immediately, open the 
top (the dampers being out), and thus keep it in good con- 
dition until wanted. Always take off the draughts as soon 
as you have finished a meal, thereby saving labor and fuel. 
The best ranges are ruined, and large quantities of coal are 
wasted daily by filling the ranges too full and leaving the 
draughts open to burn like a fiery furnace. 

Use everything for its proper purpose. Do not strain 
the bouillon or soup through the finest napkin, when there 
are soup-strainers hanging in the kitchen. 

Let your dress be simple and neat, your head perfectly 
smooth and tidy. A white linen cap, that can be washed 
every week, will keep the odors from your hair, and add to 
your tidy appearance. Keep yourself and kitchen as clean 
as possible ; make no dirt, and thereby save yourself the 
trouble of constant cleaning. Never use your hands when 
a knife or a spoon will answer. 

As every one likes variety, do not serve the same dish 



TO COOKS 869 

twice in one week unless it be a vegetable ; nor do I like the 
way of serving certain dishes the same day every week, 
for instance, beef on Monday, chicken on Tuesday, etc. 
In this way the family anticipate, and it spoils the true en- 
joyment of their meals. 

Never give " things " out the alley gate unless you are 
told by the mistress to do so. 

If your mistress finds fault, bear it patiently ; it is she, 
and not yourself, for whom you are working, and it is your 
whole duty to please her. One rude answer might cost you 
a good situation. Receive your orders attentively. If you 
cannot rely upon your memory, have a slate and write them 
down. This slate will also answer for memorandums of 
things wanted. 

Visit the cellar every morning. See if the meat and 
poultry are keeping properly. Look at the stock. In fact, 
examine all the eatables to see if they require cooking. 

Clean your refrigerator twice a week, if it has a metal 
lining ; if a " Ridgway," once a week is quite sufficient. 

Be scrupulously particular about the care of food and 
utensils. Dry your saucepans before putting them away, 
that they may not rust. Wash all knives and forks, without 
wetting the handles, quickly after using them. If you use 
copper utensils, see that the tin lining does not become 
worn off ; if it does, have it instantly repaired. 

Throw jelly-bags, pudding-cloths, and strainer-cloths 
into clear warm water immediately after using them. As 
soon as you have leisure, wash them through several waters ; 
if they are greasy, use borax ; scald them, rinse well, and 
hang to dry. When thoroughly dry, fold neatly and put 
away in their proper places. 

Always keep a brush for your sink, another for the 
baking-boards and other clean purposes, another small one 
for pots and pans. Pour boiling soda-water down your 



370 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

sink every morning ; this prevents the drain from being 
clogged with grease. Never drain onion or cabbage water 
down the kitchen sink, as in that way the house is per- 
meated with the odor. 

If a dinner-party is in prospect, ask early for the bill 
of fare, and prepare as many dishes as possible the day 
before, to avoid confusion on the fixed day. 

Be just and honest ; do as you would be done by ; re- 
member that you occupy the chief position among the ser- 
vants of the household, a position upon which the health 
and happiness of the family depend, and you will always 
be worthy of the greatest respect. You may be sure of 
success and a good home. 



PASTRY AND PIES 



To make a light, crisp, and flaky crust, use a good, fine 
flour and none but the best butter. Have everything, in- 
cluding yourself, cool. A marble slab makes the best 
pastry-board. Use a glass rolling-pin, if convenient; if 
not, one made from hard wood with movable handles. 
Always use ice or very cold water in mixing, and keep the 
paste in a cold place. Plain paste is improved by keeping 
it on the ice before using it. Puff paste may be kept four 
or five days. If you should stand your paste outside in 
cold weather, to cool, be careful that it does not freeze, as 
this spoils its lightness. No matter how light your paste 
may be, the substance of each stratum is dense and hard 
of digestion, and should never be eaten by persons of weak 
digestive powers. 

PUFF PASTE 
" If 'twere done when '/is done, 

Then "'twere well 'twere done quickly'" 1 MACBETH. 

i pound of sifted flour i teaspoonful of sugar 
i pound of good butter White of one egg 
i teaspoonful of salt A cup or more of ice-water 

Scald a large bowl, then fill it with cold water, and let stand 
until the bowl is cold. Wash the hands in hot soapsuds, 
then rinse them in cold water, but do not dry them. This 

prevents the butter from sticking to the hands and bowl. 

(371) 



372 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Turn the water out of the bowl, and nearly fill it with ice- 
water, put the butter into it, and wash by working it with 
the hands under the water until it becomes soft and elastic ; 
then pat it into a cake, and put it on the ice until wanted. 
Put the flour on a marble slab or a very large meat plate, 
make a well in the centre of it, and put into this well a lump 
of the washed butter the size of an egg, the white of the 
egg, sugar, and salt. Now work this with the thumb and two 
fingers to a paste, add gradually the ice-water, and gradually 
work in the flour. When all is worked in, knead as you 
would bread for five minutes, then cut the paste into halves, 
roll out each half into a sheet, quickly break the butter into 
bits, and lay it over one sheet ; dredge it thickly with flour, 
cover with the other sheet, pound lightly with the rolling- 
pin ; roll from you, into a long, thin sheet ; now fold in 
first the sides, then the ends ; turn the paste around so that 
the fold will run to and from you. Now roll from you 
again, fold as before, place it on a tin pie dish, and stand 
it away on the ice for fifteen minutes, then roll and fold 
twice again, and again stan$ on the ice. Do this until you 
have rolled it eight times. Let it stand on the ice over 
night, and it is ready for use. 

If then rolled in a napkin, and put in a cold, dry 
place, it will keep nicely for one week. 

It is almost impossible for any one to make good puff 
paste from a recipe without first seeing it made. 

TO BAKE PUFF PASTE. 

The most important part of all is the oven, for if you have 
used the best materials, have mixed them as directed, and 
then put the paste in an oven not properly heated, you 
have wasted both materials and labor. The paste should 
be icy cold when it is put into the oven, and the oven 
should be very hot (460 Fahr.). 



PASTRY AND PIES 373 

For patties, the oven should have a strong under-heat, 
allowing them to rise their full height before browning. 
Then put them on the grate to brown. If the oven should 
be too hot, and the paste begins to brown as soon as it is 
put in the oven, quickly open the draughts of the stove and 
stand a small basin of ice-water in the oven. This will 
immediately reduce the temperature. 

PLAIN PASTE WITH BUTTER 

3 cups of sifted flour i cup or a half-pound of butter 
i teaspoon ful of salt i teaspoonful of sugar 

Nearly a cup of ice-water 

Have everything as cold as possible. In warm weather, 
stand the butter and flour in the refrigerator several hours 
before using them. Sift the flour, measure, and put into a 
large mixing-bowl ; add the salt and sugar ; then place the 
butter in the centre of the flour, and with a sharp knife cut 
it quickly into small pieces, at the same time mixing it with 
the flour ; now add the ice-water gradually, lifting with 
the knife that portion which you have moistened first, and 
pushing it to one side of the bowl, wet another portion, 
and so continue until all is moistened. Then cut and mix 
it together until you can lift it from the bowl with the 
knife. (A word of caution : add the water very carefully, 
wetting only the dry flour, never stirring twice in the same 
place.) Dredge the baking-board lightly with flour, turn 
the paste out on this, dredge with flour, and roll lightly 
and quickly from you into a long, thin sheet. Fold first 
the sides and then the ends, turn the paste around and roll 
from you again, as before ; fold and roll again ; then fold 
and stand on the ice until wanted. 

To have this paste a perfect success, the materials 
should be very cold, mixed and rolled quickly, using as 
little flour as possible in finishing.

PLAIN PASTE WITH LARD 

Many housekeepers always use lard instead of butter for 
pastry, simply because it is cheaper ; but, as it makes a 
greasy and brittle crust, there is no doubt that it is more 
indigestible than the light, flaky, and tender crust made 
from good, sweet butter. For the benefit of those who use 
lard the following recipe is given : 

i quart of sifted flour 

i cup of lard 

i teaspoon ful of salt 

Nearly a cup of ice-water 
Make and roll precisely the same as Plain Paste with Butter. 



PLAIN PASTE HALF AND HALF 

i quart of sifted flour 
YZ cup of lard ( ^ fib) 
YZ cup of butter (^ lb) 

i teaspoon ful of salt 

Nearly a cup of ice-water 

Wash the butter as directed in recipe for Puff Paste ; put 
it on the ice until wanted. Put the flour into a mixing- 
bowl, add the salt, mix, and with the hands quickly rub 
into it the lard ; add the water gradually, moistening as 
directed in Plain Paste with Butter. Dredge the baking- 
board lightly with flour, turn the paste out on this, and roll 
from you into a long, thin sheet. Now take the butter 
from the ice, break it quickly into small bits and place 
them over the paste ; dredge quickly with flour, fold in the 
sides, then the ends; turn so that the last fold will run 
to and from you, and roll from you again. Never roll but 
the one way. Now fold the same as before, and roll out 
again ; do this four times. Stand it on the ice, or in a 
cold place, for one hour, and it is ready for use. 

Jt may be kept two or three days in a cold place,

Cover the meat with boiling water and simmer gently until 
tender, then stand away until cold. Shred the suet and 
chop it fine. Pare, core and chop the apples. Stone the 
raisins. Shred the citron. When the meat is perfectly 
cold, chop it fine, and mix all the dry ingredients with it ; 
then add the juice and rinds of the lemons and oranges, 
mix well, and pack in a stone jar; pour over the brandy 
and wine, cover closely and stand in a cool place. Mince 
meat made by this recipe will keep all winter. When ready 
to use, dip out the quantity desired, and thin with cider 
or wine. 

One word here about cleaning the currants. First put 
them into a large bowl, and to every pound add a half-cup 
of flour ; mix the flour thoroughly through the currants, 
and then rub them between the hands until all the stems 
are rubbed off; put them in a colander, and pour over end- 
less quantities of cold water until all the twigs, gravel 
stones and sand are washed off; now scald them, then 
wash again in cold water, drain, spread them on pie dishes, 
and stand in a cool oven, with the door open, to dry. 

Fresh beefs tongue or heart may be boiled, chopped, 
and used instead of beef, if preferred.

VOL-AU-VENT 

A vol-au-vent is very difficult to make, even by the most 
experienced cook, and cannot be made perfectly without 
first taking a lesson. For those who wish to try it, the fol- 
lowing recipe is given: 

Make puff paste as directed, and stand it on the ice 
over night. The next morning, roll it out an inch in 
thickness ; turn a basin the shape of the dish in which you 
wish to serve the vol-au-vent upside down on the paste, 
and with a sharp knife cut around the basin ; remove the 
basin, and place another basin of a smaller size and same 
shape on the paste ; Now cut around this basin only half- 
way through the paste, leaving about an inch and a half 
around the edge ; now brush the vol-au-vent all over the 
top with a beaten egg, being very careful not to touch the 
sides. Put it on a tin or iron sheet, stand again on the ice 
until very cold ; then put it into a very hot oven to bake 
for thirty-five minutes. Be careful not to scorch, as it 
burns quickly. W T hen done, carefully remove the piece 
marked out with a sharp knife, lay it aside for the cover. 
Scoop out all the unbaked portion from the inside, put the 
vol-au-vent back in the oven to dry. When ready to serve, 
if filled with the White Fricassee of Chicken, it is then 
Vol-au-Vent of Chicken. For Vol-au-Vent of Oysters, 
fill with Creamed Oysters ; Lobster, with Creamed Lob- 
ster, etc.

PATE de FOIES GRAS 

These are usually made in French pie moulds, holding 
about two quarts, requiring a large quantity of materials, 
and costing from five to six dollars; but they can be so sim- 
plified that any housekeeper can make them for one-half the 
above cost, and will be so pleased with results that she will 
enter them at once on her weekly bills of fare.

i slice of bacon or quarter of a pound of ham 
YZ pound of veal 

i Terrine de Foies Gras aux Truffes du Perigord, 

Strasbourg 
i^ pint of mushrooms 

Salt and pepper 

Remove the fat from the top of the foies gras, take them 
from the pot and mash, adding about a tablespoonful of the 
fat you have taken off. Chop the veal very fine. Scald the 
liver, dry it with a towel, and chop it also very fine. Cut 
the bacon or ham into dice. Line an ordinary tin one- 
quart basin about two inches deep with a sheet of the plain 
paste. In the bottom put a layer of veal, next a layer of 
fois gras, next a layer of mushrooms, chopped, then a layer 
of liver, then a sprinkling of ham, pepper and salt, and so 
on until the materials are used. Roll out another piece of 
paste for the top cover, make an opening in the centre, 
place it over the top, and press the edges of the upper and 
the under crust firmly together. With a sharp knife cut a 
few leaves from the trimmings of the paste, arrange them 
tastefully in the centre of the top crust. Place it in a 
quick oven, and bake one hour; as soon as the top crust is 
a nice brown, cover it with a sheet of writing-paper to pre- 
vent its burning. When done, carefully lift it from the 
basin, place it on a folded napkin, and serve.

OYSTER PATTIES 

I batch of puff paste 25 nice fat oysters 

i pint of milk or cream i tablespoonful of butter 

i tablespoonful of corn-starch Salt and pepper to taste 
Roll out the puff paste about an inch thick. Then, with a 
round tin cutter, cut out a patty, and lay it on a greased 
tin sheet. Brush it lightly over the top with the beaten 
yolk of an egg, being careful not to allow any of the yolk 
to run down the sides, as it cements the edges together 
and prevents it from being light; then take a cutter, two 
sizes smaller, and press it in the centre and nearly through 
the patty, and so on until you have the whole cut. Now 
put them on the ice for a half-hour, or until the oven is 
very hot (400 Fahr.). Then bake about twenty minutes, 
or until a nice brown. The inside cut acts as a non-con- 
ductor, and prevents the heat from reaching the centre, 
consequently all the paste inside this ring should be 
unbaked. Now remove the lid crust carefully, and save it 
for the lid of the patty. Take out this unbaked portion 
with a spoon. Put the patties back in the oven for ten 
minutes; leave the door open, as they only want a little 
drying. Now put the oysters on to boil,, in their own 
liquor; as soon as they boil, drain them. Put the milk or 
cream on to boil in a farina boiler. Rub the butter and 
corn-starch together until smooth, and add to the boiling 
milk or cream ; stir until it boils, add salt and pepper, and 
last, the oysters; let boil up again, and take from the fire. 

TO FILL THE PATTIES 

Put two oysters and a little sauce in each one, put on the 
lid, and serve. 

For what to do with the unbaked paste, see remarks 
"What to Save, and How to Use It."

COLD PUDDINGS 

BIRD'S-NEST PUDDING (COLD) 

FOR THE NEST 

Make an Orange Jelly (see recipe). Turn a pie dish upside 
down in the bottom of a two-quart round tin basin, pour 
the jelly in the basin over the pie dish, and stand away to 
harden. 

FOR THE STRAWS 

Cut the orange peel into fine strips with the scissors. Boil 
one cup of sugar and a half-cup of water to the crack, that 
is, until it hardens when dropped in cold water. Dip the 
straws into this syrup and place on greased papers to harden. 

FOR THE EGGS 

Put one pint of milk on to boil in a farina boiler, moisten 
four tablespoonfuls of corn-starch with a little cold milk, 
and stir into the boiling milk; stir until it thickens, then 
add a quarter-cup of sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Have ready some egg shells that have been emptied from a 
small hole in the top, fill them with this mixture, stand in 
a pan of Indian meal or flour to prevent them from falling 
over, and put in a cold place to harden. 

When the jelly is hard, whip a pint of cream. Now 
turn the jelly out on a round glass dish, remove the pie 
dish carefully, put the straws around the space left by the 
pie dish, representing a nest, and fill the nest, inside the 
straws, , with the whipped cream, representing feathers. 
Break the shells carefully off the corn-starch eggs, and put 
them in the centre of the nest, and it is ready to serve. 

Just as troublesome as it reads, but beautiful when 
done.

it, and fill that part of the mould, so that when you turn 
the pudding out, the rose on top will be pink, and the 
pudding its natural color. Stand the mould away until this 
hardens, then pick it on the surface with a fork (this makes 
the other jelly stick to it, and will not separate when you 
turn it out). Now pour in the remainder of the liquid, 
which should be cold, but not jellied. Now stand it away

i box of gelatine Juice of four oranges 

Juice of four lemons i pound of sugar 

i pint of cold water i^ pints of boiling water 

y^ pound of candied cherries ^ pound of angelica 
Half the rule for Orange Cream 

Cover the gelatine with the cold water, and let soak one 
hour. Then pour on it the boiling water ; add the sugar, 
and the juice of the oranges and lemons; stir until the sugar 
is dissolved ; strain through a flannel bag, and stand away to 
cool, but not harden. Have two plain moulds, one hold- 
ing two quarts, and the other holding one quart. While 
the jelly is cooling, dip the larger mould into ice water, and 
garnish with the cherries and angelica; dip them in a little 
of the jelly and that will make them stick to the mould, 
and you can then arrange them in any form you choose. 
For instance, make a rose of the cherries, and leaves and 
stems of the angelica. Then cover with a little of the 
liquid gelatine, which must be cold, and stand it in a pan 
of cracked ice to harden. When this jelly is perfectly 
hard, set the small mould in the centre of the large one, 
and fill it with cracked ice ; fill the space between the two 
moulds with the remainder of the liquid jelly, and stand 
away until perfectly hard; this will take at least five 
hours. When hard, remove the ice from the small mould; 
dip out with a spoon, the water from the melted ice, and 
wipe the inside of the mould with a towel that has been 
dipped in warm water. This will loosen the mould, and 
you can lift it out carefully, Fill the vacant space with the 
orange cream ; stand away in a cold place for three hours. 
Serve with a Vanilla Sauce poured around it. 

This is a troublesome pudding, but very good and 
sightly.

1 8 nice ripe peaches 
i pound of sugar 
i pint of small strawberries 
y? pint of water 
The recipe for Charlotte Russe 

Boil the sugar and water together until it is brittle when 
dropped in cold water ; that is, when it begins to boil up 
in large bubbles, take a tittle of it on a spoon and drop it 
into cold water; if it snaps in breaking, it is sufficiently 
boiled. Take it from the fire immediately. Rub a plain 
two-quart mould with melted butter or oil. Have ready 
the peaches pared, cut into halves and stoned, the straw- 
berries stemmed. Put a piece of peach on a wooden 
skewer, dip it in the syrup, then dip a berry in the syrup, 
and place in the centre of the peach where the stone was 
taken out, then press it against the side of the mould, and 
so continue until the mould is lined, then stand away in a 
cold place to harden. When hard, fill with Charlotte Russe, 
and stand in a cold place for an hour or two. When ready 
to serve, put a plate over the mould, turn it upside down, 
wipe the outside of the mould with a warm cloth, then 
carefully lift it off. This dish is both beautiful and good.

hour, then add to it two tablespoonfuls of boiling water 
and stir until dissolved. Dip a plain two-quart mould in 
cold water, then stand it in a pan of ice-water. Stem the 
berries, and dip each one in the gelatine, then press them 
against the inside of the mould ; in this way they will 
stick, allowing you to arrange them in any fancy design 
you may choose. A wreath around the side of the mould 
and a rose in the bottom made from the berries is very 
pretty. Angelica may be used for the leaves and stems, or 
you may line the mould perfectly solid with the berries. 
Now fill with Charlotte Russe and stand away to harden.

APPLE DUMPLINGS No. i 

1 quart of flour i large tablespoon ful of 

2 heaping teaspoonfuls butter or lard 

of baking-powder i teaspoonful of salt 

YZ pint of milk 

Pare the apples and take out the cores with a corer. Put 
the pot over the fire with just enough water to half cover 
the dumplings ; or, if you are going to steam them, which 
is much the better way, have steamer over the pot, which 
should be half-full of boiling water. Now put the flour 
into a bowl, and rub into it the butter or lard, then add 
the salt and baking-powder, mix well, and moisten with 
the milk, using more or less, as the flour requires to make 
a soft dough ; that is, a dough that will roll out nicely with- 
out being sticky. Take the dough out on a baking board, 
roll it out about a half-inch in thickness ; now cut out the 
dumplings or the covering for the apples with a large round 
cutter, about the size of a common saucer ; put one apple 
in the centre of each piece, fill the space from which the 
core was taken with sugar, and a little cinnamon if you 
like, and carefully work the dough over the apple. If you 
boil them, tie each one in a floured cloth, or put them into 
netted dumpling-bags, plunge them immediately into the 
boiling water, and boil thirty minutes. If you steam, place 
them on a- dinner-plate a little smaller than the steamer, 
stand the plate in the steamer and steam forty minutes. 
Serve on the plate on which they were steamed. Serve hot, 
with Hard Sauce or sweetened cream.

drop of water, and stand them on the back part of the 



PUDDINGS AND DESSERTS 427 

fire to dry, then mash and beat them until light ; add the 
salt, butter, and milk, and beat again ; add gradually suffi- 
cient flour to make a dough that will roll out without sticking 
to the board. Now take the dough and knead it lightly, 
roll out about a half-inch in thickness, and finish same as 
Apple Dumplings, No. i. These dumplings must be served 
as soon as done. They can wait, after they are ready to 
cook, for a halPhour or more, then put them on to cook 
just forty minutes before you are ready to serve them. 

These dumplings are delicious baked and served with 
Vanilla Sauce.

the apples and take out the cores. Fill the spaces from 
which the cores were taken with sugar and cinnamon. Then 
cover the apples all over with a thick coating of the boiled 
rice. Tie each dumpling tightly in a dumpling cloth, and 
put them in a pot of cold water. Bring the water quickly 
to a boil, and boil forty minutes. When done, untie the 
cloth, turn the dumplings out carefully on a large plate. 
Serve with Hard or Cream Sauce.

ICE CREAMS 



PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAMS 

To make good Philadelphia ice cream, use only the best 
materials. Avoid gelatine, arrowroot, or any other thick- 
ening substance. Good, pure cream, ripe fruit, or the best 
canned in winter, and granulated sugar, make a perfect ice 
cream. Next, get a good freezer, one working with a crank, 
and double revolving dasher, making a triple motion. 

Fruit and fruit flavorings should be added to the cream 
after the latter is frozen. The best ice cream is made by 
first scalding the cream and dissolving the sugar in it while 
hot. When raw cream is frozen, the flavoring is not so 
prominent, and the cream has a frozen, snowy taste, and is 
never perfectly smooth and velvety. Cheaper ice creams 
are usually made in this way, as they swell to double their 
original bulk. 

Before turning the mixture into the freezing-can, see 
that the dasher is right side up, and the can properly ad- 
justed ; then pour in the mixture, put on the cover, fasten 
the crank, and give it a turn to see that all is right. 
Pound the ice fine in a coarse bag, and get the salt, which 
should be coarse or rock. A four-quart freezer will require 
ten pounds of ice and two quarts of salt. Now put in a 

layer of ice about three inches deep, then a layer of salt 

(445) 



446 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

one inch deep, and continue this to the top of the can. 
Now turn the crank slowly and steadily until it goes pretty 
hard. If properly packed, it will take twenty to twenty- 
five minutes to freeze. It is not well to freeze too quickly. 
Water ices require a longer time than ice creams. When 
frozen, remove the crank, wipe the lid of the can, and 
take it off, being careful not to allow any salt to fall into 
the can ; remove the dasher, and scrape it off; take a large, 
wooden spatula or mush stick, and scrape the cream from 
the sides of the can, and beat and work steadily for ten 
minutes ; this makes the cream smooth. Now put the lid 
on the can, put a cork in the hole where the dasher was 
taken out, drain off the water from the tub, repack with 
salt and ice, cover the tub with a piece of carpet, and stand 
away in a cold place for one or two hours to ripen. When 
the cream is fresh, in tasting, you taste each ingredient 
separately, but after standing one or two hours they blend 
and form a pleasant whole. This is called ripening. When 
ready to serve, dip the can quickly in cold water and wipe 
it, then turn the cream out on a dish. If you wish to serve 
the cream in forms, after you are done workirg it with a 
wooden spatula, fill the mould or form with the cream, 
press it down with a spoon, being careful to fill every part 
of the mould. Bind the edge of the mould with a piece 
of letter paper, put on the lid and press it down. Dip a 
strip of muslin in melted butter and cover the joint. Pack 
the mould in salt and ice for one or two hours until wanted. 
If you have no freezer, an impromptu one may be made by 
using a tin pail for the can and a bucket or cask for the 
tub. In this case it will have to be stirred occasionally, 
while freezing, with a wooden spoon or flat stick, replacing 
the lid of the kettle after each stirring, and give the pail a 
rotary motion in the ice. 

To freeze puddings, follow the same directions.

Sugar to taste half-pint of strawberry juice 

Whip the cream to a froth, as directed in Cafe Parfait, then 
add the strawberry juice and sugar, mix carefully, and finish 
same as Cafe Parfait. If canned strawberries are used, 
they must be pressed through a colander. 

Parfait may be made from any flavoring or fruit de- 
sired, the parfait taking the name of the flavoring or fruit 
used, as Chocolate Parfait, Vanilla Parfait, etc. 

ORANGE SOUFFLE (FROZEN) 
i quart of cream i pint of orange juice 

Yolks of six eggs y z box of gelatine 

i pound of sugar 

Cover the gelatine with a half-cup of cold water, and soak 
one hour ; then add a half-cup of boiling water, and stir 
until dissolved. Mix the orange juice and sugar together 
until they form a syrup. Beat the yolks of the eggs to a 
cream. Whip the cream. Now mix the syrup and yolks 
together in a tin basin, stand the basin in a pan of ice- 
water, strain the gelatine into it, and stir carefully until it 
begins to thicken, then stir in lightly and hastily the 
whipped cream, turn into an ice-cream mould, pack in salt 
and ice, and freeze two hours. 

This should not be frozen as hard as ice cream. 
Serve with Montrose Sauce poured around it. 
This will serve ten people. By changing the flavoring 
and adding sugar acordingly, endless varieties of souffles 
may be made from this recipe. 



WATER-ICES AND SHERBETS 



In all recipes where the sugar and water are boiled, the 
time must be noted exactly, the scum removed from the 
syrup, and the syrup strained through a fine cloth while hot, 
and then cooled before adding the fruit juice, or the true 
flavor^ will be lost. The freezer must be packed according 
to directions given for freezing ice cream. Turn the crank 
very slowly for a few minutes, then rest for about five min- 
utes, turn slowly again and again rest and continue this 
until the water-ice is frozen pretty hard. A much longer 
time is required for freezing water-ice than ice cream. 
When you can turn no longer, take out the dasher, scrape 
down the sides of the can, and give the water-ice a 
thorough beating with a paddle. Put a cork in the lid of 
the can, draw the water from the tub, re-pack it, cover 
with an old piece of carpet, and stand away two or three 
hours to ripen, that is, to become mellow and smooth. 

Fruit jelly may be used in the place of fresh fruit, 
allowing one pint of jelly and a half-pound of sugar to 
every quart of water. 

If you wish a sherbet instead of a water-ice, proceed 
exactly the same until you put it in the freezer, then turn 
the dasher rapidly and steadily until the mixture is frozen 

pretty hard. Then remove the dasher, beat the white of 

(458) 



WATER-ICES AND SHERBETS 459 

one egg to a froth, add one tablespoonful of powdered 
sugar, and beat again until it will stand alone. Stir this 
into the sherbet, beat well, cover, and stand away to ripen. 

TO MOULD 

When the sherbet or ice is to be served in a form, wet the 
mould with cold water, fill it with the frozen mixture, pack 
down well into all the designs, put a piece of white letter 
paper over the open end, put on the lid and press it down 
tightly, then pack in salt and ice. When ready to serve, 
wash in cold water, remove the lid, and turn the sherbet 
out on a plate. If it should stick, wait a moment, and 
perhaps the heat of the room will loosen it ; if not, wash 
again with water. Do not dip the mould in hot water, for, 
no matter how quickly it is done, it spoils the shape of the 
form.

water and one pint of orange juice. 

WINE JELLY 

i box of gelatine y 2 pint of cold water 

i pint of sherry i pint of boiling water 

Cover the gelatine with the cold water, and let it soak one 
hour, then add the boiling water and sugar, and stir until 
the sugar is dissolved ; add the wine, strain through a flan- 
nel, turn into forms, and stand away to harden. 

PORT JELLY 
Make the same as Wine Jelly, using one pint of port wine. 

This makes a very dark jelly. 

(467) 



468 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

BRANDY JELLY 

Make the same as Wine Jelly, using a half-pint of wine, 
and a half-pint of brandy, instead of the one pint of wine. 

CARDINAL JELLY 

i box of gelatine i pint of cranberry juice 

YZ pint of sherry y 2 pint of cold water 

i pint of boiling water i pound of sugar 
Cover the gelatine with the cold water, and let soak one 
hour ; then add the sugar and boiling water, stir until the 
sugar is dissolved, then add the wine. Put one quart of 
cranberries in a porcelain-lined kettle, and stand them over 
the back part of the stove until thoroughly heated, then 
mash them, and squeeze through a flannel bag ; add one 
pint of this juice to the jelly, and strain the whole through 
the jelly-bag. Stand away to cool. 

A GOOD MIXED JELLY 

i box of gelatine i pound of sugar 

Juice of two lemons Juice of two oranges 

y?, pint of sherry i gill of brandy 

y& pint of cold water i quart of boiling water 

Cover the gelatine with cold water, and let soak one hour ; 
then add the sugar and boiling water, stir until the sugar 
is dissolved ; ' then add the lemon and orange juice, the 
sherry and brandy. Strain through a flannel jelly-bag, and 
stand away to harden. 

ROCK-WORK OF JELLY 

Make a Cardinal and Lemon Jelly, pour each in a large tin 
basin, and stand in a cold place over night. When ready 
to use, cut the jelly into blocks and heap on a round, flat 
dish, using dark and light jellies alternately. Garnish with 
smilax studded with carnations. 

This makes a very handsome dish to serve with sweet- 
meats. 



JELLIES 469 

CALF'S FOOT JELLY 

4 calves' feet 2 inches of stick cinnamon 

6 quarts of cold water i pound of white sugar 
Juice of four lemons Juice of two oranges 

Whites and shells of two eggs 

Clean the feet, wash and scrub them well in cold water. 
Put them in a soup kettle with the cold water, and simmer 
slowly for eight hours. It should be reduced to two 
quarts. When done, strain the liquid into an earthen 
bowl, and stand it away until next day. In the morning, 
remove all the fat from the surface, and the sediment from 
the bottom of the jelly. Now put it in a kettle, and stand 
it over the fire ; add the cinnamon, sugar, lemon and 
orange juice, the whites of the eggs slightly beaten, and the 
shells crushed. Mix all the ingredients well together, and 
boil it hard, without stirring, twenty minutes. Now throw 
in a gill of cold water, let it come again to a boil ; then 
stand it on the side of the range, and keep it closely cov- 
ered for a half-hour. Dip a flannel jelly-bag into boiling 
water, and hang it where a bowl can be placed under- 
neath. Now pour the jelly into the bag carefully, and let 
it drip slowly. On no account must you squeeze or touch 
the bag, as this clouds the jelly at once. Turn it into 
moulds, and stand in a cold place. 

If you use wine, a half- pint of sherry may be added 
before putting it into the moulds. 

ASPIC JELLY 

i pound of uncooked beef i large tablespoonful of 
A knuckle of veal butter 

^ pound of bacon i onion 

i slice of turnip ^ carrot 

1 slice of parsnip A stalk of celery 

2 cloves 6 pepper-corns 



470 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

1 blade of mace 3 whole allspice 

A chip of lemon rind i tablespoon ful of Worces- 

2 quarts of water tershire sauce 

Salt to taste 

Put the bacon in the bottom of a soup kettle, let it brown, 
then add the onion cut in slices ; stir until a nice brown ; 
then add the butter, and, when hot, the beef; cover the 
kettle and let it simmer until a thick brown glaze is formed 
in the bottom of the kettle ; then add the veal and the 
water, and simmer gently for two hours. Now add the veg- 
etables, Worcestershire sauce, spices, and lemon rind, and 
simmer two hours longer. When done, it should be reduced 
one-half. Strain and clarify the same as Bouillon. Turn 
into a square mould or the small aspic jelly moulds. If 
you use a large mould, cut the jelly into blocks. 

This is used as a garnish for Beef a la Mode, Boned 
Turkey, or any other cold-meat dish. 

FRUIT JELLIES 

APPLE JELLY 

Lady blush or fall pippins are best for jelly. The first 
make a bright-red jelly, and the latter an almost white 
jelly. 

Wipe the fruit, cut it into pieces without paring or 
removing the seeds. Put into a porcelain-lined kettle and 
barely cover with cold water ; cover the kettle, and boil 
slowly until the apples are very tender ; then drain them 
through a flannel jelly-bag do not squeeze, or the jelly 
will be cloudy. To every pint of this juice allow one pound 
of granulated sugar. Put the juice into a porcelain-lined 
kettle, and bring it quickly to a boil ; add the sugar, stir 
until the sugar is dissolved, then boil rapidly and continu- 
ously until it jellies, skimming the scum as it comes to the 



JELLIES 471 

surface ; twenty minutes is usually sufficient, but sometimes 
I have boiled it thirty- five minutes before it would jelly 
properly. It is wise to commence testing after fifteen 
minutes' boiling. To do this, take out one teaspoonful'of 
the boiling jelly, pour it into the bottom of a saucer, and 
stand it in a cold place for a moment ; then scrape it one 
side with a spoon if jellied, the surface will be partly 
solid ; if not, boil a few minutes longer, and try again. 
As soon as it jellies, roll the tumblers quickly in boiling 
water, then fill them with the boiling liquid. Stand aside 
until cold and firm (about twenty-four hours). Then, if 
you have jelly-tumblers, put on the lids ; if not, cover with 
two thicknesses of tissue paper, and paste the edges of the 
paper down over the edge of the tumbler. Then moisten 
the top of the paper with a sponge dipped in cold water. 
This moistening stretches the paper, so that when it dries 
again it shrinks and forms a covering as tight and smoo*th 
as bladder skin. I do not recommend jelly being covered 
with brandied paper, as in my hands it has never been sat- 
isfactory. The jelly, in cooling, forms its own air-proof 
covering, and if the top of the tumbler be well secured, it 
is all that is necessary. Keep in a cool, dark place. 

CRAB APPLE JELLY 

Cut the large Siberian crab apples into halves, and then 
into quarters, and to every five pounds of apples allow one 
pint of water. Proceed and finish precisely the same as for 
Apple Jelly. 

BLACKBERRY JELLY 

The uncultivated blackberries are best for jelly, and should 
be rather under- than over-ripe. Put the berries into a 
stone jar, stand it in a kettle of cold water, cover the top 



472 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

of the jar, and boil slowly for one hour, or until the ber- 
ries are quite soft. Now put a small quantity at a time into 
your jelly-bag, and squeeze out all the juice. Measure the 
juice, and to each pint allow one pound of granulated 
sugar. Turn the juice into a porcelain-lined kettle, and 
stand over a brisk fire. Put the sugar into earthen dishes 
and stand them in the oven to heat. Boil the juice rapidly 
and continuously for twenty minutes, then turn in the sugar, 
hastily stirring all the while until the sugar is dissolved. 
Dip your tumblers quickly into hot water, watch the liquid 
carefully, and, as soon as it comes again to a boil, take it 
from the fire and fill the tumblers. 

If the fruit is over -ripe, your jelly will never be firm, 
no matter how long you boil it. 

Follow these directions carefully, and you will never 
fail. 

CHERRY JELLY 

For Cherry Jelly, use the pie or morello cherry, and pro- 
ceed the same as for Blackberry Jelly. 

CRANBERRY JELLY 

i quart of cranberries i pound of sugar 

y? pint of water 

Wash the cranberries and put them on with the water to 
boil for ten minutes, then mash and squeeze through a 
flannel bag. Return the juice to the kettle, add the sugar, 
boil rapidly and continuously for about fifteen minutes, or 
until it jellies, and turn out to cool. 

CURRANT JELLY 

Select currants that have been freshly picked and are not 
too ripe. If they are sandy, wash them, but do not stem. 
Mash a small quantity at a time in a stone jar, with a 



JELLIES 473 

potato-masher, squeeze through a flannel bag, then strain 
again without squeezing, that the liquid may be perfectly 
clear. Turn the liquid into a porcelain-lined kettle, stand 
over a brisk fire. Put the sugar into earthen basins, and 
put in the oven to heat. Boil the juice twenty minutes 
after it begins to boil, then stir in hastily the hot sugar, 
and stir until the sugar is dissolved, no longer. Skirn 
thoroughly, bring it quickly to a boil again, and boil two 
minutes. Dip the tumblers into hot water, fill them with 
the boiling liquid, and stand away for twenty-four hours to 
jelly. If it is not then sufficiently jellied, cover the 
tumblers with common window-glass and stand in the sun 
several days. Then cover with tissue paper as directed 
for Blackberry Jelly. 

DAMSON JELLY 

Make precisely the same as Blackberry Jelly. 

GRAPE JELLY 

For this use ripe Concord, Isabella, or Clinton grapes. 
They should be freshly picked, and with the bloom on. 
Make precisely the same as Blackberry Jelly. 

GREEN GRAPE JELLY 

Fox grapes are the best for this. Stem the grapes, put 
them in a porcelain-lined kettle, barely cover with cold 
water, and finish the same as Apple Jelly. 

PEACH JELLY 

Pare, stone, and slice the peaches, put them into a stone 
jar, and to each half-peck of peaches, allow one cup of 
water. Crack a dozen of the kernels and throw them in 
with the peaches. Stand the jar in a kettle of boiling 



474 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

water, cover closely, and boil for one hour, stirring until 
the fruit is well broken, then turn into a flannel jelly-bag, 
and hang up to drip. To every pound of this juice allow 
the juice of one lemon and one pound of granulated sugar. 
Finish the same as Apple Jelly. 

PEAR JELLY 

Make precisely the same as Apple Jelly. This is very 
difficult to make. 

PLUM JELLY 

For this use the common blue plums. Wash them in cold 
water, put them into a porcelain-lined kettle, and to each 
half-peck allow a pint of water; cover the kettle, and stew 
slowly until the plums are boiled to pieces; then turn into 
a flannel jelly-bag and let drip slowly; do not squeeze, or 
the jelly will be cloudy. Finish the same as Apple Jelly. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Wipe the fruit, cut it in halves, then in quarters, remove 
the seeds but do not pare. Now cut the quinces into thin 
slices, and finish the same as Apple Jelly. 

The better way is to use the nice pieces for canning or 
preserving, and save the parings and knotty pieces for jelly, 
always rejecting the seeds, as they prevent the jelly from 
being clear and firm. 

RASPBERRY JELLY 

Make precisely the same as Blackberry Jelly. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY 
Make precisely the same as Blackberry Jelly.

ter cut into dice. Beat the eggs until very light, stir them 
into the cream ; then add the sugar, slowly, stirring all the 
time; then add the flour, spices, and yeast ; give a thorough 
beating, and add the currants well floured. Pour into a 
square baking-pan, well greased (the batter should be about 
one inch thick), cover, and stand in a warm place to rise 
for four or five hours. When it has doubled its bulk, place 
in a moderately quick oven, and bake one hour. When 
done, turn from the pan, dust with powdered sugar, and 
use while fresh. 

SWING FELLOWS 

Make the same as Rusk, and, when light enough for the 
pans, instead of making into balls, take off a piece the size 
of a coffee-cup, roll it out the size of a tin pie dish, and 
about one inch thick, place it on a greased pie dish, make 
holes about one inch apart all over the top, put a small bit 
of butter, a teaspoonful of sugar, and a little cinnamon in 
each hole. Set away until light, and bake in a moderately 
quick oven twenty minutes.

Boil the milk, add the butter while hot, and let it stand 
until blood-warm (98 Fahr.), then stir in the yeast and 
flour. Beat well, cover, and let stand in a warm place (70 
Fahr.) until morning. In the morning, beat the sugar and 
yolks together, add them and the cinnamon to the sponge. 



478 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

Wash and rub the currants, then dry them in a towel, flour 
them, then add them and the citron. Work with the hand 
until thoroughly mixed. Now add flour until you can take 
the dough out on a board. Roll out, cut with a round 
cutter, put in greased pans, cover, and set away in a warm 
place (72 Fahr.) until very light. Bake in a quick oven 
(300 Fahr.) thirty-five minutes. 



CINNAMON BUN

light, pour over them the milk, add the butter, and let 
stand until lukewarm ; then add the yeast and salt and 
sufficient flour to make a thin batter. Beat thoroughly and 
continuously for five minutes ; cover, and stand in a warm 
place over night. In the morning, add one cupful of flour, 
beat thoroughly, and then add sufficient flour, a little at a 
time, working all the while with the hand, to make a soft 
dough. Take out on the baking-board and knead lightly 
for ten minutes (it must not be as stiff as bread). Put back 
into the bowl, cover, and let stand in a warm place until 
very light. Then take about one-half of this dough out on 
the baking-board, roll it out into a thin sheet, spread 
lightly with butter, cover thickly with sugar, sprinkle with 
dried currants and cinnamon, and roll tightly in a long 
roll. Cut through this roll about each two inches, place the 
buns flat, closely together in a greased pan. Roll out the 
remaining dough in the same manner, cover, and stand 
again in a warm place until very light. Bake in a moder- 
ately quick oven for about a half-hour. Turn them out of 
the pan while hot.

strings, then add the fruit well floured, turn it into a greased 
pan, cover, and stand in a warm place (72 Fahr.) until 
light (this will take about two hours). Bake in a moderate 
oven three-quarters of an hour. 



FANCY CAKES 



In making cake, accuracy in proportioning the ingredients 
is indispensable. Success usually follows those who are 
attentive to each detail. The baking is usually the most 
difficult part. It is useless to attempt to make good, light 
cakes unless the eggs are perfectly fresh, and you have 
good, sweet butter and fine flour. 

HINTS TO BE REMEMBERED 

Never beat the but'ter, sugar, or eggs in a tin basin. Use 
an earthen bowl and a wooden spoon. 

Measure everything carefully before beginning. 

Always beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately. 

Powdered sugar makes a lighter cake than granulated. 

Measure the flour after sifting, unless the recipe says 
otherwise. 

Use judgment about the thickness of the batter, as 
flour differs in thickening qualities. When the cake rises 
in the centre, and cracks open, and remains that way, you 
may be sure you have used too much flour. 

When a recipe calls for a teaspoon ful of baking-pow- 
der, you can always use in its place one teaspoonful of 

cream of tartar, and a half-teaspoon ful of soda. Sift the 
( 4 8o) 



FANCY CAKES 481 

cream of tartar in the flour ; dissolve the soda in a table- 
spoonful of boiling water, and add it to the cake before the 
whites of the eggs. 

Currants should be cleaned, w/ua^ed and dried, and 
then floured before using. Raisins should be seeded and 
floured. 

Lard is best to grease the cake pans, as butter sticks 
and burn easily. 

Have the oven ready to receive the cake as soon as it 
is mixed. The oven can wait for the cake, but the cake 
can never wait for the oven. 

Cakes without butter require a quick oven ; with but- 
ter, a moderate oven. 

Cookies or small cakes require a moderately quick 
oven ; molasses cakes, careful watching, in a moderately 
quick oven, as they scorch easily. 

If your cake browns as soon as you put it in the oven, 
the oven is too hot; cool it as quickly as possible by lifting 
a lid, and cover the cake with a piece of paper. The cake 
will not be so nice, but it is the best you can do. 

Never move a cake in the oven until the centre is 
thoroughly set. 

Do not put anything in the oven while a cake is baking 
or it will surely fall. 

When you look at the cake while baking, do it as 
quickly as possible, and shut the door carefully. 

In the recipes the time required for baking is given as 
nearly as possible, but never take a cake out unless you are 
sure it is done. If you have doubts, run a broom-splint 
through the centre, and if no dough adheres, the cake is 
done. Or put your ear to the cake, if it ticks loudly, put 
it back, it is not done ; if the ticking is very faint, it is 
done. 



482 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

If the oven is at the proper temperature you can hold 
your bare hand in the hottest part, while you slowly count 
thirty (about twenty seconds). 

It is always v M to line the cake-pans with greased 
paper to prevent burning at the bottom, and it will also aid 
you in removing the cake. 

When the cake is done, turn it out gently on a sieve 
or cloth, remove the paper, and allow it to cool. Never 
handle while hot. 

Use cups of the same size to measure all the materials. 

Never melt or warm the butter, but beat it to a cream. 
Add to all cakes a quarter-teaspoon ful of salt.

cool. Next day, mix one pint of champagne, a half-pint 
of the best brandy, and one gill of strawberry syrup to- 
gether. Stand the cake in a stone butter-pot, a little larger 
than the cake, pour over the brandy mixture, paste the top 
of the pot over with paper, put on the cover, and stand in 
a cool place one month. At the end of that time, remove 
the paper, turn the cake, paste the top over again with 
paper, put on" the lid, and let stand another month, and it 
is ready for use. 

This cake is troublesome, but well repays one for the 
trouble. 

This will make a seven-pound cake.

yolks, and beat thoroughly. Now add flavoring and milk, 
then the flour. Beat the whites to a stiff froth, and stir 
them carefully into the other ingredients; add the baking- 
powder, and stir just enough to mix. Now take out one- 
third of the mixture, and add to it the cinnamon, currants, 
and chopped citron. Grease three sheet pans of the same 
size, put the fruit mixture into one, and the remaining two- 
thirds in the other two pans. Bake in a moderate oven for 
a half-hour. When done, take from the pans. Spread one 
light cake with a layer of soft icing, then place the dark 
cake on this, and spread it with icing, then place the other 
light cake on this, cover the whole with a piece of paper, 
and then with a tin sheet, on which place two light weights. 
Let stand one hour, and then remove the weights.

CREAM PUFFS 

y, pint of water 2 ounces of butter 

4 ounces of flour 4 eggs 

Put the water and butter on to boil, and, as soon as it boils, 
turn in the flour and stir quickly over the fire until it sticks 
together, forming a ball, which leaves the pan. Stand 
away to cool. When cool, add one egg at a time, beating 
all the while. After adding the last egg, beat vigorously 
for five minutes. Stand in a warm place for a half-hour, 
stirring occasionally ; then drop by tablespoon fuls on but- 
tered tins, leaving a space of two inches between each puff. 
Bake in a quick oven about twenty minutes. Try by 
picking them up. If perfectly light, they are done. As 
they burn quickly, watch carefully. When cold, make an 
opening in one side, about the middle of the puff, and fill 
with the following :

502 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS 

Prepare the batter the same as for Cream Puffs. Put it into 
a pastry-bag, and press it out upon well-buttered tins. By 
pressing the bag firmly, and drawing it very slowly towards 
you while squeezing, you will make the eclairs of a rope- 
like shape. They should be about five inches long. Allow 
two inches space between each eclair. Bake in a quick 
oven twenty n^nutes, or until thoroughly done. If prop- 
erly baked, the inside will be hollow, with a delicate, tender 
crust outside. When cold, fill with the same Cream Puff 
Filling. 

THE ICING 

Melt two ounces of chocolate, then add four tablespoon fuls 
of powdered sugar, and stir until it forms a paste. Dip 
the bottom of each eclair into the icing, and stand it away 
to dry. 

Eclairs may be filled with whipped cream or preserved 
fruits, and iced with Orange Icing. 

KISSES 

Whites of six eggs 
12 ounces of powdered sugar 

i tablespoonful of vanilla-sugar 

Beat the whites with a wire egg-whip until frothy, then add 
gradually, the sugar, beating continuously until the whites 
are stiff enough to cut with a knife. Dip a tablespoon into 
cold water, fill it with the mixture, and drop it on a sheet 
of buttered paper. Place the paper on baking-tins, sift 
quickly and lightly with powdered sugar, blow off all that 
will not stick, and put immediately into a quick oven. 
Watch constantly that they do not burn. When firm to 
the touch, take them from the oven, remove them carefully 
from the paper, scoop out the soft portion and return the 
shells to a very slow oven to dry. These may be filled with 
whipped cream or ice cream, and two put together. 



FANCY CAKES 503 

The dry shells will keep some time and may be filled 
when ready to use. 

Or, drop the mixture by small spoonfuls on buttered 
paper, dust with sugar, blow off all that does not stick, 
place the paper on baking-sheets, put in a quick 'oven until 
a light fawn-color ; then place them in a cool oven for two 
hours to dry. When dry, carefully remove the kisses from 
the paper, brush the bottom lightly with^Jie white of egg, 
stick two together, and put away to. dry. 

LADY FINGERS 

Make Sponge Cake batter, turn it into a pastry-bag with a 
No. i tube in the end, and squeeze it out the shape of lady 
fingers. Dredge with powdered sugar, and put in a very 
moderate oven to bake. They must not spread or swell. 
If they spread, the oven is too cool ; if they swell, the 
oven is too hot. When done, remove them carefully from 
the pan, put the two flat sides together, and lay them on a 
sieve to cool. 

There are pans indented the shape of lady fingers, 
which are less troublesome than using the pastry-bag.

hour before using. Break them carefully and beat the 
whites until frotfTy, then sift the sugar in gradually, beating 
all the while; add the lemon juice, and continue the beat- 
ing until the icing is fine and white, and stiff enough to 
stand alone. Keep in a cool place until wanted. Spread 
with a knife dipped in ice-water. If ornaments are used, 
they must be placed on the cake while the ice is still moist. 
This may be varied by adding different flavorings, such as 
strawberry, pineapple, rose, vanilla, etc. 

Strawberry icing should always be colored with a few 
drops of cochineal.

and let stand two hours, and it is ready to use. 

ROSE CREAM CANDY 

Make same as preceding recipe, add a half-teaspoon ful of 
cochineal, and a teaspoonful of rose water instead of the 
vanilla. 

CREAM CHOCOLATES 

Put the white of one egg and an equal quantity of cold 
water into a bowl ; add a teaspoonful of vanilla, and beat 
until frothy ; add sufficient confectioners' xxx sugar to 
make a stiff paste that you can form into balls (this will 
take about a pound and a quarter). Work until smooth, 
form into small balls the size of a cream chocolate, 
stand on greased paper, and put in a cool, dry place to 
harden (about two hours). Put a half-pound of chocolate 
into a small, bright, tin basin, and stand it over the tea- 
kettle or boiling water to melt, then stand it in a basin of 
boiling water to prevent its cooling while you dip the 
creams. Place one ball on the end of a fork, dip it down 
into the melted chocolate, see that it is thoroughly covered, 
lift it up, drain, scrape off the fork on the side of the basin, 
then slide the cream chocolate back on the greased paper, 
and so continue until all are dipped. Stand in a cool place 
over night, and they are ready to use. 

These are very little trouble, and, if made carefully, 
are delicious.

NOUGAT No. i (Blot) 

Throw a pound of sweet almonds into boiling water for 
five minutes ; skin them well ; and, when cool, cut them in 
four or five pieces lengthwise ; then melt a pound of fine 
white sugar with two tablespoon fuls of water, in a copper 
or crockery pot, on a good fire, stirring all the time with a 
wooden spoon. When well melted, put the almonds in ; 
keep stirring about five minutes longer, take from the fire, 
add a little of the rind of a lemon well grated. Oil a 
plain mould, put it on the corner of the range in a warm 
but not too hot place ; put the almonds and sugar in the 
mould, pressing them to the side and bottom of the mould 
with a lemon cut in halves, and take off when of a brown 
color. Turn on a plate, remove the mould, and serve.

water together without stirring (after the sugar melts) until 
it hardens and becomes brittle when dropped in cold water; 
then add a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and pour into the 
pans over the filling. When nearly cold, mark out in nar- 
row strips with a knife. 



FRUITS 



Fruit should be served as fresh as possible, the large fruits 
cold. The small acid fruits are rendered more acid by 
being chilled. Fresh, ripe fruit is particularly wholesome 
if taken in the early part of the day. Liebig says : 
"Besides contributing a large proportion of sugar, mucil- 
age, and other nutritive compounds in the form of food, 
they contain such a fine combination of vegetable acids, 
attractive substances, and aromatic principles, with the 
nutritive matter, as to act powerfully in the capacity of 
refrigerants, tonics, and antiseptics, and when freely used 
at the season of ripeness, by rural laborers and others, they 
prevent debility, strengthen digestion, correct the putrefac- 
tive tendency of nitrogenous food, avert scurvy, and prob- 
ably maintain and strengthen the power of productive 
labor." 

APPLES 

For the table, select those of a spicy flavor ; wipe them 
clean and polish with a soft towel. Serve in a fruit dish or 
a small, pretty basket. Use only a silver knife in cutting. 

BANANAS 

Bananas should be served whole, the large, red and lady 

fingers mixed, 

(513) 



514 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

CURRANTS 

The large cherry and the white currants may be served 
together. Select large clusters, rinse them by dipping in 
and out of cold water, then place on a sieve to drain. Ar- 
range them on a pretty dish, and serve in saucers around a 
small pyramid of powdered sugar. Take the stem between 
the thumb and finger, dip the fruit lightly in the powdered 
sugar, and eat from the stem. 

They may also be stemmed and mixed with an equal 
quantity of raspberries. 

GRAPES 

Grapes should be rinsed in cold water, drained on a sieve, 
and then arranged in a pretty basket; fruit scissors should 
accompany the basket, to divide the clusters. 

ORANGES 

Oranges may be served whole, cut in halves crosswise, and 
eaten with a spoon. 

Or, peeled, cut in small pieces, rejecting the seeds. 
Sprinkle with powdered sugar, let stand an hour, and serve. 

PEACHES 

Pick out the finest, large, yellow peaches. Rub the wool 
off carefully, handling as little as possible. Serve in a 
pretty basket with peach or rose leaves around the basket. 

Or, pare and slice, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and 
serve immediately (or they will turn dark), with thick 
cream. 

PEARS 

Pears may be served the same as Apples. 

PINEAPPLE 

Pare, remove the eyes, and pick the pineapple in small 
pieces with a silver fork, stripping it from the core. Never

use a knife to cut the pineapple as it destroys the flavor. 
Sprinkle with powdered sugar. Stand in a cold place one 
hour before serving. 

POMEGRANATES 

Remove the outside skin and carefully take out the seeds, 
rejecting every particle of the thin brown skin that separates 
the sections. Heap the seeds on a pretty dish, mix with 
them finely-chopped ice, and serve. 

STRAWBERRIES, RASPBERRIES and BLACKBERRIES 

Pick them carefully, without mashing, only a few moments 
before you wish to serve them. Heap them in a glass dish, 
and send around powdered sugar and cream with them. 
Allow each guest to sugar his own. 

Never wash any kind of berries, as it destroys their 
flavor. 

Strawberries for breakfast may be served with their 
stems on, the same as Currants. 

WATERMELON 

A watermelon should be thoroughly chilled before serving; 
then cut it into halves. Cut a thin slice off each end to 
make it stand firmly on the platter. Scoop out in egg- 
shaped pieces with a tablespoon, and serve. 

CANTALOUPE 

Cut in halves, remove the seeds. Serve one-half to each 
guest. Eat with a spoon. Cantaloupes should be served 
very cold. 

BAKED APPLES 

Wipe sweet apples perfectly clean, and remove the cores 
without paring, stand them on an earthen baking-dish, and

Or, pour over them drawn butter, flavored and sweet- 
ened. 

STEWED APPLES 

Pare tart apples, cut them into quarters and remove the 
cores; put them into a porcelain-lined kettle, strew with 
sugar, add the juice of half a lemon and a few bits of the 
yellow rind; cover with boiling water, and simmer gently 
until tender. Dish carefully without breaking, and serve 
cold. 

CODDLED APPLES 

Pare tart apples of uniform size ; remove the cores without 
breaking the apples. Stand them in the bottom of a por- 
celain-lined kettle, strew thickly with sugar, cover the bot- 
tom of the kettle with boiling water, put on the lid, and 
allow the apples to steam on the back part of the stove 
until tender. Dish carefully without breaking; pour the 
syrup over them, and stand away to cool. 

BLACKBERRY FLUMMERY

Put the blackberries and water on to boil. Boil slowly ten 
minutes without stirring. Moisten the corn-starch in a 
little cold water, stir it into the boiling blackberries, stir 
carefully until it thickens, take from the fire, add the sugar, 
and turn out to cool. Serve cold, with sugar and cream. 

BLACKBERRY MUSH 

Make the same as Flummery, using three tablespoonfuls of 
corn -starch instead of two. 



FRUITS 517 

STEWED CRANBERRIES 

Wash one quart of cranberries, put them in a porcelain- 
lined kettle, add one pint of water, cover the kettle, and 
stew ten minutes; add one pound of sugar, and stand on 
the back part of the stove where it will not boil, for fifteen 
minutes, then turn out to cool. 

STEWED GOOSEBERRIES 

Stem and top one quart of berries, and cook the same as 
Cranberries. 

BAKED PEARS 

For this choose large sweet pears. Wipe them, but do not 
remove the stems. Stand them in an earthen baking-dish, 
pour around them a cup of boiling water, add two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, cover with another dish, and bake 
slowly until the pears are tender, basting three or four 
times with the liquor. When done, stand away to cool in 
the dish in which they were baked. When cold, lift them 
carefully into a pretty glass dish, pour the liquor over them, 
and serve with sugar and cream. 

STEWED PEARS 
Pears may be stewed precisely the same as Apples. 

STEWED PRUNES 

Wash the prunes through several cold waters, cover them 
with fresh cold water, and soak over night. Next day, 
turn them with the water into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
sweeten to taste, and let them simmer very gently until 
tender. When done, remove them carefully with a skim- 
mer, and boil the syrup rapidly for ten minutes; then 
pour it over the prunes, and stand away to cool. 
Dried peaches may be stewed in the same way.

one pound of sugar. Put the rhubarb into a porcelain- 
lined or granite kettle, cover it with the sugar, and stand 
it on the back part of the fire until the sugar melts; then 
bring it to boiling point without stirring. Then turn it 
carefully out to cool, and it is ready for use. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 



CANNING 

The process of canning the different kinds of fruit varies 
but little, except in the amount of sugar used. None but 
perfectly sound and fresh fruits should be used for this pur- 
pose. They may be canned with or without sugar, as the 
sugar takes no part whatever in their preservation. The 
fruit should not be cooked sufficiently long to destroy its 
natural flavor, and while boiling hot should be sealed in 
air-tight glass jars, filled to overflowing to exclude every 
particle of air, then quickly sealed. The jars should be 
thoroughly heated before filling, filled through a wide- 
mouthed funnel, and should, during this process, stand on 
a folded damp towel, to prevent breakage. Large-mouthed 
glass jars, with porcelain-lined or glass tops only, should 
be used. After filling and screwing on the tops, stand 
the jars in a warm part of the kitchen, where the air 
will not strike them, over night. In the morning you 
will be able to give the tops another turn. Then wipe the 
jars carefully, and put them away in a cool (not cold) dark 
closet. In a week or two examine them carefully; if the 
liquid has settled, and you see no small air bubbles, or the 
porcelain-lined tops slightly indented, you may be sure that 
the fruit is keeping ; if you ffnd the opposites, the fruit is be- 
ginning to ferment, and the jars will burst if not opened. 

Re-cook and use them at once for stewed fruit, as it is never 

(519)

satisfactory to return them to the jars. All large fruits should 
be thrown into cold water as soon as pared, to prevent dis- 
coloration, then boiled in clear water, in which has been 
dissolved a quarter-teaspoonful of powdered alum to every 
quart of water, until tender, then drained and boiled a few 
moments in the syrup. Cook only enough to fill one or 
two jars at a time ; have the jars hot and everything ready 
as soon as the fruit is done. Fill the jars quickly, run a 
silver spoon handle around the inside of the jar to break 
any air bubbles that may be there, and then screw on the 
tops without delay. 

Small fruits are best sugared one or two hours be- 
fore cooking, and then if you add the same proportion 
of alum, they will be clear and keep their shape. 
They should just be brought to boiling point, skimmed, 
and sealed immediately. 

The surplus juice that exudes from strawberries and 
plums may be strained and boiled for jelly. 

By following these directions religiously, and using 
the quantities given in the recipes that follow, success is 
sure. 

APPLES 

i pound of sugar The grated yellow rind of 

4 pounds of apples one lemon 

i quart of water 

Pare the apples, throw them into cold water. When you 
have enough to fill one or two jars, take them from the 
water, put them in a porcelain-lined kettle, cover with 
boiling water, stand them on the back part of the fire, 
where they will scarcely bubble, until tender. While they 
are cooking, put the sugar andwater in another kettle, stir 
the sugar until it is dissolved, add the lemon rind, and boil 
three minutes. When the apples are sufficiently tender to 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 521 

admit a straw, lift them carefully with a strainer from the 
water into the syrup, bring to boiling point, skim, and can 
as directed. 

PEACHES 

Proceed precisely the same as for Apples. 

PEARS 

Proceed precisely the same as for Apples. 
Bartletts are best for canning. 

PINEAPPLE 

Pare the pineapple, take out the eyes, then pick the pine- 
apple into pieces with a silver fork. To every pound of the 
picked pineapple allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Put the pineapple into a porcelain-lined kettle, add the 
sugar, and cook over a very moderate fire ten minutes. 
Can as directed. 

Or, the pineapple may be grated. 

QUINCES 

Pare and core the quinces and cut into rings. Finish the 
same as apples, using a half-pound of sugar to every pound 
of quinces. 

The skin and rough pieces may be used for jelly. 

BLACKBERRIES 

To every pound of blackberries allow a quarter-pound of 
sugar. Put the berries in a porcelain-lined kettle, cover 
them with the sugar, and let stand one or two hours, then 
add a quarter-teaspoon ful of ^powdered alum to each quart 
of fruit. Stand over a moderate fire, and bring to boiling 
point. Skim, and can as directed. 



522 PHILADELPHIA COOK ROOK 

CHERRIES 

Stone the cherries ; and, if pie or morello cherries, allow a 
half-pound of sugar to every pound of cherries. If ox- 
hearts, a quarter-pound of sugar. Proceed the same as 
for Blackberries. 

CURRANTS AND RASPBERRIES 

To every quart of the large red raspberries allow a half-pint 
of currant juice and a half-pound of sugar. Put the ber- 
ries in a porcelain-lined kettle, add the juice and sugar, 
bring to boiling point, and can. 

DAMSONS 

To every five pounds of damsons allow three pounds of 
sugar. Finish the same as Blackberries. 

BLUE PLUMS 

Allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound 
of plums. Proceed as for Blackberries. 

Gages may be canned in the same manner, first pricking 
the skins to prevent cracking. 

STRAWBERRIES 

Can the same as Blackberries, using a half-pound of sugar 
to every pound of strawberries. 

PRESERVING 

To preserve, use equal quantities of fruit and sugar, and 
cook sufficiently long to keep the fruit without being her- 
metically sealed. Use only the best white sugar. 

Small fruits should be cooked slowly forty minutes ; 
large fruits, pared and put immediately into the syrup, and 
then cooked very slowly until you can pierce them with a 
straw. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 523 

Put the fruits into tumblers or very small jars, and 
thereby prevent disturbing a larger quantity than is needed. 

PRESERVED CITRON 

Pare off the outer skin, cut into halves, remove the seeds, 
then divide each half into a number of smaller pieces. Put 
them in a stone jar, add a half-cup of salt to every five 
pounds of citron. Cover with cold water, and stand aside 
for five hours; then drain, and cover with fresh, cold 
water. Soak two hours, changing the water three or four 
times. Dissolve a teaspoonful of powdered alum in two 
quarts of boiling water, add the citron, and bring to boil- 
ing point. Drain. Make a syrup from two and a half 
pounds of granulated sugar and one and a half quarts of 
boiling water, boil and skim. When perfectly clear, put in 
the citron and simmer gently until you can pierce it with a 
straw. When tender, lift the pieces carefully with a skim- 
mer, place them on a large plate, and stand in the sun one 
or two hours to harden. Peel the yellow rind from one 
large lemon, add it to the syrup, then add the juice of two 
lemons, and a small piece of green ginger-root cut in thin 
slices. Boil gently for ten minutes, and stand aside until 
wanted. When the citron has hardened, put it cold into 
the jars, bring the syrup again to a boil, and strain it over 
the citron. 

Watermelon rind and pumpkin may be preserved in 
the same manner. 

MARMALADES OR JAMS 

BLACKBERRY JAM 

Put the blackberries into a porcelain-lined kettle, stand 
them over a very moderate fire until thoroughly heated, 
then press them through a sieve. Measure the liquid, and 



524 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

to every pint allow a half-pound of sugar. Put the sugar 
and liquid back into the kettle and boil rapidly twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching. Pour 
into tumblers or jars, and seal the same as fruit jelly. 

GRAPE JAM 

Pulp the grapes ; put the skins in one basin and the pulps 
in another. Pour the pulps into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
and bring to boiling point ; then press them through a 
colander, add the skins, and measure. Finish the same as 
Blackberry Jam. 

Or, after boiling the twenty minutes, the whole may 
be pressed through a sieve to make it fine. 

ORANGE MARMALADE (Miss Parloa) 
Take equal weights of sour oranges and sugar. Grate the 
yellow rind from one-fourth of the oranges. Cut all the 
fruit in halves at what might be called the "equator." 
Pick out the pulp and free it of seeds. Drain off as much 
juice as you conveniently can, and put it on to boil with 
the sugar. Let it come to a boil ; skim, and simmer for 
fifteen minutes ; then put in the pulp and grated rind, and 
boil fifteen minutes longer. Put away in jelly tumblers. 

PEACH MARMALADE 

Rub the peaches, but do not pare them. Cut them in 
halves, remove the stones, and, to every pound of peaches, 
allow a half-pound of sugar. Put the peaches in a porce- 
lain-lined kettle, add sufficient water to cover the bottom 
of the kettle; cover, and heat slowly to boiling point; then 
stir and mash the peaches tmtil fine, add the sugar and 
three or four kernels (to every quart of marmalade) 
blanched and pounded to a paste. Boil and stir continu- 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 525 

ally for fifteen minutes, then stand over a more moderate 
fire, and cook slowly twenty minutes longer. Stir occa- 
sionally, that it may not scorch. Put away in stone jars. 

Plum Marmalade and Quince Marmalade may be 
made in the same manner. 

BRANDY PEACHES 

Take large white or yellow freestone peaches. (They must 
not be too ripe.) Scald them with boiling water ; cover, 
and let stand until the water becomes cold. Repeat this 
scalding, then take them out, lay them on a soft cloth, cover 
them over with another cloth, and let them remain until 
perfectly dry. Now put them in stone jars, and cover with 
brandy. Tie paper over the tops of the jars, and let them 
remain in this way one week. Then make a syrup, allow- 
ing one pound of granulated sugar and a half-pint of water 
to each pound of peaches. Boil, and skim the syrup, then 
put in the peaches, and simmer until tender ; then take the 
peaches out, drain, and put them in glass jars. Stand the 
syrup aside to cool. When cold, mix equal quantities of this 
syrup and the brandy in which you had the peaches. Pour 
this over the peaches, and seal. 



PICKLING 



SWEET PICKLES 

Sweet pickles should be rich, and sufficiently cooked to 
keep without being hermetically sealed. 

SPICED PEACHES 

7 pounds of peaches i teaspoon ful of ground cloves 

4 pounds of sugar 2 teaspoon fuls of allspice 

i pint of vinegar 2 teaspoonfuls of cinnamon 

y<2, ounce of ginger root ^ teaspoon ful of ground mace 
Pare the peaches, but do not remove the stones. Put the 
vinegar and sugar on to boil. Mix the spices, and divide 
them into four parts. Put each part into a small square of 
muslin, tie tightly, and then throw them into the sugar and 
vinegar. When this mixture is hot, add the peaches ; bring 
all to boiling point, take from the fire, and turn carefully into 
a stone jar. Stand in a cool place over night. Next day, 
drain all the liquor from the peaches into a porcelain-lined 
kettle, stand it over a moderate fire, and, when boiling hot, 
pour it back in the jar over the peaches. Next day, drain 
and heat again as before, and do this for nine consecutive 
days ; the last time boil the liquor down until there is just 
enough to cover the fruit. Add the fruit to it, bring the 

whole to a boil, and put in jars or tumblers for keeping. 
(526) 



PICKLING 527 

The following fruits may be pickled or spiced in the 
same manner : 

Cantaloupe Pears Quinces 

Cherries Plums Watermelon rind 



SOUR PICKLES 

For these, use none but the best cider vinegar. Do not 
boil it, as in this way it is weakened ; bring it only to 
scalding-point before pouring it over the pickles. A tiny 
piece of alum scalded with cucumber or gherkin pickles 
makes them crisp. 

Always prepare pickles in porcelain -lined or granite 
kettles ; use wooden spoons, never metal. Spice carefully, 
so that one flavor will not predominate, but will all com- 
bine to make a pleasant whole. Cucumbers and other 
pickles are often so strongly flavored with onion, spices, 
etc., that the original flavor is entirely lost. 

Pirkles should be kept in a dark dry place in stone or 
glass jars. 

Nasturtiums or a small piece of horse-radish thrown 
in each jar prevents the vinegar from moulding. 

If you wish your cucumbers green, put them into cold 
vinegar in a porcelain-lined kettle, stand them over a mod- 
erate fire, and heat slowly until they become green. 

As pickles of all kinds are indigestible, eat sparingly 
and masticate thoroughly. 

MIXED PICKLES 

y& medium-sized head of 6 large green tomatoes 

cabbage i large or two small Spanish 

4 large roots of celery onions 

4 tablespoon fuls of grated 2 cucumbers

layer about two inches thick in the bottom of a jar, sprinkle 
it with a tablespoonful of salt, then another layer of vege- 
tables and salt, and so on until all is used. Let stand 
twenty-four hours, then drain, and press out all the liquor ; 
cover with boiling water, let stand again ten minutes, then 
press with your hands until perfectly dry. Add to one 
quart of vinegar, a quarter-teaspoonful of powdered alum, 
and stir until dissolved. Now put a layer (two inches 
thick) of the pickles in the bottom of the jar, then sprinkle 
with mustard seed, black pepper, and the grated horse-rad- 
ish ; now another layer of pickles, and so on until all is 
used. Now pour over it the vinegar, let stand two days, 
and it is ready to use.

Cover the cucumbers with strong salt water and soak twenty- 
four hours. Then mix all together. Put the vinegar in a 
porcelain-lined kettle. Mix the mustard and turmeric 
together, and moisten them with a little cold vinegar, then 
stir them into the hot vinegar and stir continually until it 
begins to thicken ; then add the sugar, mustard seed, and 
oil, stir again and pour this, while hot, over the vegetables. 
Put away in glass or st.one jars.

PICKLES 529 

Pare the cucumbers and onions, and slice them in thin 
slices. Put a layer of cucumbers, then a layer of onions, 
then a heavy sprinkling of salt, then another layer of 
cucumbers, and so continue these alternations. On top, 
place a heavy weight to press them down ; let stand over 
night, or at least six hours. Then drain off the liquor. 
Put a tablespoonful of powdered alum in sufficient cold 
vinegar to cover the pickles, stir until the alum is dissolved, 
pour this over the cucumbers and onions, and stand aside 
for four or five hours. Then drain. (This vinegar may be 
saved to use for other purposes.) Put the cucumbers and 
onions into glass or stone jars. Mix the mustard, pepper and 
celery seed with the oil, then add gradually the two quarts of 
vinegar, and pour over the cucumbers and onions. Fasten 
the jars, and in two weeks the pickles will be ready to use.

other ingredients, cover with vinegar, and simmer gently 
fifteen minutes. Put away in stone or glass jars. 

PICKLED ONIONS 

Pour boiling brine over the small button onions, let them 
stand twenty-four hours, then drain, and cover with hot 
vinegar spiced to taste. 

SMALL CUCUMBER PICKLES 

Wash and wipe one hundred small cucumbers and place 
them in jars. Cover them with boiling brine, strong 
enough to bear an egg ; let stand twenty-four hours. Then 
take them out, wipe, place in clean jars, and cover with 
hot vinegar, spiced with an onion, twelve whole cloves, one 
ounce of mustard seed, and three blades of mace. They 
will be ready to use in two weeks. 

LEMON PICKLE 

For this choose small fruit with thick rind. Rub them with 
a piece of flannel ; then slit them down the quarters, but 
not quite through the pulp, fill these slits with salt and press 
it in. Stand them upright in an earthen dish for four days 
until the salt melts. Then turn them three days in this 
liquor. Drain, and add to the liquor sufficient cider vinegar 
to cover them, add one Jamaica pepper, and one small 
piece of green ginger-root cut into small pieces. Bring to 
boiling-point and skim, then stand aside to cool. When 
cold, pour it over the lemons, and put away in glass jars. 

PICKLED WALNUTS 

The walnuts should be gathered when very young and soft, 
soft enough to be easily pierced with a pin. They should 
be gathered in the middle of the day, when the sun is hot 



PICKLES 531 

upon them. Rub them with a coarse flannel. Then make 
a brine from salt and water, strong enough to bear an egg, 
and let them lie in it nine days, changing the brine every 
other day. At the end of this time, take them out, spread 
them on large dishes and expose them to the atmosphere 
for about thirty minutes. Then pour over them boiling 
water, then take them out one at a time, rub them with a 
piece of coarse flannel, and pierce them with a large needle 
in several places. Now place them in glass jars. To every 
hundred walnuts allow one gallon of vinegar, one ounce 
of cloves, one ounce of allspice, one ounce of black pepper, 
a half-ounce of mace, and a half-ounce of nutmeg. Put 
the spices in the vinegar, and scald in a porcelain kettle for 
fifteen minutes. Then strain the vinegar, and pour it, 
boiling hot, over the walnuts ; add a large tablespoon ful 
of grated horse-radish, and a cupful of mustard-seed. 
Cover closely and stand in a cool place. 

MANGOES. 

Cut the tops from one dozen red and one dozen green 
peppers. Remove the seeds and save the tops. Stand the 
peppers upright in a tub ; put a teaspoonful of salt in each 
one, cover with cold water and soak twenty-four hours. 
Drain. Cut two large, heads of cabbage on a cabbage 
cutter, add to this one teaspoonful of ground cloves, one 
teaspoonful of ground allspice, four tablespoon fuls of whole 
mustard and two tablespoon fuls of salt ; mix thoroughly. 
Stuff the peppers with this mixture. Put on the tops and 
tie tightly. Stand them upright in stone jars, and cover 
with cold vinegar. 

Mangoes are also made from peaches and small melons. 



CATSUPS 



CUCUMBER CATSUP 

For this, choose large, ripe cucumbers. Pare, remove the 
seeds, and grate. To every pint of this pulp allow : 

J^ pint of cider vinegar 

y^ teaspoonful of cayenne 

1 teaspoonful of salt 

2 heaping tablespoon fuls of grated 

horse-radish 

Drain the grated cucumber in a colander, then mix with 
all the other ingredients. Bottle and seal. 

MUSHROOM CATSUP 

Take freshly gathered mushrooms and examine them care- 
fully to see that they are all right. Wipe them, but do not 
wash. Put a layer of the mushrooms in the bottom of an 
earthen dish, then sprinkle well with salt, then another 
layer of mushrooms, another of salt, and so on alternately ; 
cover with a folded towel, and stand in a very warm place 
for twenty-four hours ; then mash and strain through a 
coarse bag. To every quart of this liquor add one ounce 
of pepper-corns, and boil slowly in a porcelain-lined kettle 
for thirty minutes; then add a quarter-ounce of whole 
allspice, a half-ounce of sliced ginger-root, one dozen whole 
cloves, and three blades of mace. Boil fifteen minutes

i y-2, ounces of allspice assafetida 

i pint of alcohol 

Put the tomatoes on to boil, boil gently a half-hour, then 
press them through a sieve to remove the seeds and skins. 
Return this liquid to the kettle (which should be porcelain- 
lined), and boil down to one and a half gallons ; then add 
the vinegar and evaporate to one and three-quarter gallons; 
then add the sugar, salt and spices ; stir until thoroughly- 
mixed. Put the assafetida into a teacup, add to it two 
tablespoon fuls of the catsup, stir until thoroughly mixed, 
then turn it into the kettle, stir continually until the catsup 
comes to a boil, then take it from the fire and add the 
alcohol. Bottle and seal while hot. 

This recipe has been in constant use in my own family 
for years, and is pronounced, by those who have used it 
perfect. 



534 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

COLD TOMATO CATSUP 

Peel and chop very fine a half-peck of ripe tomatoes. 
Drain them in a colander, then turn them into an earthen 
vessel and add a half-cup of grated horse-radish, one cup

in five or six places, then put them in an earthen vessel, 
cover with a half-pound of salt and two quarts of vinegar. 
Cover and stand aside for six days, mashing with a potato 
masher and stirring every day. At the end of that time, 
strain off and squeeze every drop of liquor from the walnuts. 
Add a half-pint of vinegar to the remaining husks, beat 
them with a potato masher and squeeze again. Turn all 
this liquor into a porcelain-lined kettle, add to it one ounce 
of whole pepper-corns, forty whole cloves slightly bruised, 
a quarter-ounce of whole mace, a quarter-ounce of nutmeg 
cut in thin slices, a small root of horse-radish cut in slices, 
one blade of garlic chopped, one long red pepper, a half- 
pound of anchovies, and a quarter-ounce of green ginger- 
root cut in slices. Bring this mixture slowly to a boil, 
cover the kettle closely, and boil slowly a half-hour. Then 
strain through a cloth and stand aside to cool. When cold, 
add one pint of port wine; bottle, cork tightly, and seal. 
This should stand three or four months before using. 



CATSUPS 535 

IMITATION OF WORCESTERSHIRE SAUCE 
Add to one quart of vinegar three-quarters of an ounce of 
cayenne, three cloves of garlrc chopped fine, five anchovies

DRINKS 



COFFEE f 

The coffee tree is a native of southern Arabia and Abys- 
sinia, and is cultivated in various parts of the world where 
the temperature is sufficiently high and uniform. The 
seeds are inclosed in the fruit, which is a roundish berry, 
umbilicate at top, at first green, then red, and then a dark 
purple resembling our common morello cherry; each 
contains two seeds surrounded by a paperish membrane and 
inclosed in a yellowish, pulpy matter. These berries are 
allowed to ferment, then they are crushed under heavy roll- 
ers, separated, the seeds divested of their coverings, and 
dried. These seeds constitute our coffee. The character 
of coffee varies considerably with the climate and mode 
of culture. The Mocha coffee, which is known by its small, 
roundish grains, agreeable odor and flavor, takes the pre- 
cedence of all others. The Java, a large, flat grain, is 
highly esteemed in this country. The Brazilian coffees are 
between the two in size and inferior to both in flavor. 
Coffee improves by age. It ripens in the mat, losing a 
portion of its strength, and thus acquires a more agreeable 
flavor. If you buy your coffee roasted, do so in small 
quantities. Keep it closely corked and grind just before 

using; the finer it is ground, the better. The peculiar 

(539) 



540 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

odor and flavor of roasted coffee are due to the caffeic acid, 
the aromatic oil, and, doubtless, also, to the sugar, which is 
changed to caramel. An infusion made at a low tempera- 
ture (not exceeding 200 Fahr.) is much better than a 
decoction made by boiling. The darker the coffee is 
roasted, the more injurious the effects. If coffee be boiled, 
there is extracted a poisonous oil, and the delicate aroma 
and flavor of the true coffee escape in the steam ; and, if 
you wish to enjoy them, repair at once to the top of the 
house, and you will find them there. To my mind, there 
is but one true and healthful way of making coffee, and 
that is by percolation an infusion, not a decoction, being 
made. 



TO MAKE COFFEE 

The most important point in making good coffee is to use 
the water at the first boil ; after it boils a few minutes it 
parts with its gases, and becomes flat and hard, and will 
not make a perfect infusion if you use the finest berries 
that Mocha ever exported. Consequently, wash the tea- 
kettle perfectly clean every morning, fill it with fresh cold 
water, and bring it quickly to boiling-point. Have the 
coffee in the pot, allowing one heaping tablespoonful of 
finely ground coffee to each cup, pour over it the water; 
as soon as it drains through the biggin, fill the top again, 
and so on until you have the desired quantity. Serve im- 
mediately in the same pot, if possible, I have always pro- 
duced the best coffee from a mixture of two- thirds Java 
and one-third Mocha, and prefer the old-fashioned biggin 
to any other pot. 

For those who do, and always will boil their coffee, I 
hesitatingly insert the following recipe : 



DRINKS 541 

TO BOIL COFFEE 

Put four heaping tablespoon fuls of finely ground coffee 
into any sort of a pot. Put the white of an egg into a 
bowl, add to it a half-pint of cold water, beat slightly, and 
put one-third of it into the pot with the coffee; add 
sufficient cold water to thoroughly moisten. Then add 
sufficient boiling water to make the quantity desired. Cover 
the pot, stand it over a brisk fire, and bring it quickly to a 
boil. Let it boil up thoroughly about a half-minute, add 
a half-cup of cold water, and stand on one side of the fire 
a few minutes to settle. 



TEA 

Tea is the dried leaves of the tea-plant, a hardy shrub 
growing chiefly in China. The leaves are picked in May 
and June of each year, a plant yielding good leaves from 
four to five seasons. The good, bad, and indifferent teas 
are all taken from the same shrub, the difference in quality 
depending upon the. soil and the time of gathering. The 
young leaf-buds that are picked first form our finest tea, 
known as Gunpowder; the second picking is second best, 
and so on. The Hysons are also good varieties of green 
teas. The Pekoe is among the best of the black teas. 

TO MAKE TEA 

Tea, like coffee, should not be boiled, but made from 
fresh boiling water, allowing one teaspoonful to each person, 
and one to the pot. First scald the pot, and allow it to 
stand on the back part of the stove about ten minutes; 
then turn out the water, put the tea into the hot pot, and pour 
over it one-half the boiling water (that is, if you are going 
to make one quart of tea, pour over it, at this stage, one 



542 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

pint), cover the pot, and stand on the back part of the 
stove five minutes to draw; then add the remainder of the 
boiling water, and serve at once. 

Never use a metal teapot. 

Russian tea is made by putting a slice of lemon in the 
bottom of each cup, and pouring over it the boiling tea. 

COCOA 

Cocoa, or chocolate nuts, are the seeds of Theobroma 
Cacao, a handsome tree from fifteen to twenty feet in 
height, growing in Mexico, the West Indies, and South 
America. These seeds, or cacao beans, are roasted the 
same as coffee until the aroma is brought out. They are 
then pounded to a paste in a hot mortar, or ground between 
rollers. The preparation thus produced, when mixed with 
sugar, starch, cinnamon, and vanilla, forms the chocolate 
of commerce. 

Cocoa is the bean ground fine, the oil partly extracted, 
and the remaining powder mixed with a small quantity of 
sugar. 

Cocoa Nibs is the bean deprived of its husks, and 
then broken into small rough pieces. This is the purest 
and best cocoa in our markets. 

The shells or husks are also used to make a weak decoc- 
tion for persons with delicate stomachs. 

CHOCOLATE 

Put four ounces of chocolate into a farina boiler, stand it 
over the fire to melt. When melted, add one quart of new 
milk slightly warmed, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Cover the farina boiler and boil five minutes, then, with a 
whip-churn or an egg-beater, beat the chocolate until 
smooth and creamy. Serve with whipped cream. 



DRINKS 543 

COCOA 

Put one quart of milk to boil in a farina boiler. Moisten 
four tablespoonluls of cocoa with a little cold milk, pour it 
into the boiling milk, stirring all the while. Stir until it 
comes to boiling-point, cover the farina boiler, and boil five 
minutes. Serve with whipped cream. 

Broma, alkathrepta, and racahout are all made pre- 
cisely the same as Cocoa. 

COCOA FROM THE NIBS 

Put a half-cup of the broken cocoa into a farina boiler 
with two quarts of boiling water. Boil two hours, or until 
reduced to one quart, then add one pint of boiling cream, 
and serve. 

RACAHOUT POWDER 

i pound of rice flour i pound of cocoa 

i pound of confectioners' 2 ounces of arrowroot 

xxx sugar 2 ounces of sugar of milk 

i ounce of powdered salep i vanilla bean 

Mix and thoroughly rub together, put into glass jars, and 

fasten. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR 

Put two quarts of raspberries into a stone jar, and pour 
over them one quart of good cider vinegar. Cover and 
stand aside for two days, then drain off the liquid without 
mashing the berries, pour it over a quart of fresh fruit, and 
stand as before. Do this once more, the last time strain- 
ing through a muslin bag. Now add one pound of sugar to 
every pint of this liquid. Boil slowly five minutes, skim, 
let stand fifteen^ minutes, bottle, and seal. 

Strawberry and blackberry vinegars are made in pre- 
cisely the same manner. 



IN THE KITCHEN AND 
PANTRY 



It is impossible to give any directions, except in a general 
way, regarding the kitchen and pantry. Both should be 
light, airy, and well furnished with convenient and labor- 
saving utensils. A wide, roomy dresser is most convenient. 
It should have at least two closets above, and two below, 
with two deep drawers at the top of the lower closets. 
In the upper closets should be kept all the dishes necessary 
for cooking, the pudding moulds, tins, etc. In the lower 
closet, pots, kettles, saucepans, waffle irons, and broilers, all 
arranged and grouped' so that those in frequent use can be 
quickly gotten out. In the drawers should be kept cooking 
knives and forks, larding and trussing needles, wooden 
spoons and forks ; also jelly-bags, dish towels, linen soup- 
strainers, fish cloths, and a large piece of cheese-cloth that 
may be torn in convenient pieces as wanted ; a roll of tape 
and a ball of linen twine for trussing. Over the kitchen 
door there should be a ventilator. Two or three wall- 
pockets are convenient for holding papers, etc. 

Keep all scouring apparatus, chamois skins, etc., in the 
table drawers. 

By the side of the range there should be a bracket 
large enough to hold a dredging-box with flour, one with 
salt, another with pepper, and still another with sugar. 

Keep tureens, large meat plates and bowls on the 
body of the dresser. 

A corner closet in the pantry should hold all the sugar 
and spice boxes, all sauces in constant use, tea, coffee, and 

(544) 



KITCHEN AND PANTRY 545 

small dry groceries. Immediately under the window in 
the pantry there should be a stationary pastry table with 
marble top, and grooves underneath holding a hard-wood 
bread board, which can be pulled out and placed on top 
the marble when wanted for bread or biscuits. A small 
refrigerator should also be kept in the pantry to hold the 
little things that need to be kept cool while a meal is in 
preparation. By the side of the pastry table have two or 
three deep shelves to hold the bread and pies as you finish 
them. The pantry should open both into the kitchen and 
the dining-room, and should be as convenient to the range 
as circumstances will allow. It should have an abundance of 
shelves, closets, and drawers. 

Glass jars are convenient and best for most dry gro- 
ceries, such as rice, tapioca, oatmeal, etc. 

If you have a large refrigerator, place it in the base- 
ment or cellar where it can be filled with ice from a window 
or opening made for the purpose. A drain-pipe should 
also be attached to carry the water away. This saves much 
time and labor. A refrigerator should be examined daily, 
and kept scrupulously clean. Fish, onions, cucumbers, or 
any strong vegetables should not be kept in a refrigerator 
with milk or butter unless the refrigerator has an automatic 
circulation of pure, dry air. If your refrigerator is lined 
with metal, " things" will taste, one of the other. 

The inexperienced housekeeper will, we believe, be 
glad of some guidance in selecting the proper utensils 
needed in a well-furnished kitchen. There are a number 
of utensils which are not in general use which lessen the 
labor of cooking, and add much to the attractiveness of the 
food, as well as to the comfort of the cook. It certainly is 
unfair to expect a cook to prepare a well-appointed meal 
without allowing her the needful implements. The follow- 
ing list will be found to contain all the utensils needed in a 
well-furnished kitchen:

LEMON BUTTER 

i pound of powdered sugar Yolks of six eggs 
Whites of four eggs Rind of one and juice of 

]^ pound of butter two lemons 

Beat the yolks of the eggs, sugar, and butter together until 
very light; then add to them the whites, well beaten. 
Pour this into a farina boiler, and stir constantly over the 
fire unfil it thickens; then add the juice and rind of the 
lemons, and turn into an earthen vessel to cool. 

FRENCH HONEY 

Beat together a half-cup of sugar and a half-cup of butter 
until very light; then add one egg and beat again, add the 
juice and rind of one lemon, and stir the whole over the 
fire until it thickens and comes to a boil. Turn out to cool. 

NEVADA MOUNTAIN HONEY 

Boil two pounds qf white sugar, a half-pint of water, and 
a half-teaspoonful of powdered sugar together for three 
minutes, after it begins to boil. Do not stir after the sugar 
is dissolved. Add three drops of oil of rose and three 
drops of oil of peppermint to one gill of alcohol ; shake 
it well, and add a half-teaspoonful of it to the boiling syrup. 
Turn out to cool. 

This, if carefully made, is a most perfect imitation of 
strained honey. 

(549) 



550 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

TO MAKE BUTTER 

Warm the cream to a temperature of 56 or 58 Fahr., and 
it will churn in fifteen minutes. After the butter collects 
in the churn, take it out and stand it for a minute in a very 
cold place. Do not wash it, as in this way you rob it of 
certain elements necessary for its preservation. Work it 
continuously and thoroughly until all the buttermilk is out, 
adding two even teaspoonfuls of very fine salt to each 
pound of butter, after you have worked it about five min- 
utes. Make it at once into prints, and stand away in a 
cool place. 

TO MAKE CARPETS BRIGHT 

Sprinkle them with tea-leaves; sweep thoroughly, but 
lightly. Rub all spots with a clean dry cloth. Grease 
spots may be drawn out by covering with a piece of coarse 
brown paper, and then passing over them a warm flat-iron. 
The paper, if soft, will absorb the grease. 

TO WASH SILK 

Mix a quarter-pound of honey, a quarter-pound of soft 
soap, one gill of gin, and a pint of cold water together. 
Put the silk on a table or board, scrub it with this mixture, 
rubbing it in well ; then rinse in clear soft water. Shake 
it as dry as you can; do not wring it. Hang it up by the 
edges, and, as soon as it is sufficiently dry, iron it on the 
wrong side. 

A fluid for removing grease from silk and cloth may be 
made by mixing together a quarter-ounce of carbonate of 
ammonia, a quarter-ounce of fluid chloroform, a quarter- 
ounce of sulphuric ether, and one quart of distilled ben- 
zine. Bottle and cork. This, like all such mixtures, is 
very inflammable. 

GATHERING THE PERFUME OF PLANTS 

The perfume of flowers may be gathered in a very simple 
manner and without apparatus. Gather the flowers with as 
little stalk as possible and place them in a jar three parts 
full of almond or olive oil. After being in the oil twenty- 
four hours, put them into a coarse cloth, and squeeze the 



GATHERED CRUMBS 551 

oil from them. Put this oil back into the jar and fill again 
with fresh flowers, and repeat the operation according to 
the strength of the perfume desired. The oil being thus 
thoroughly perfumed with the volatile principle of the 
flowers is to be mixed with an equal quantity of pure recti- 
fied spirits, and shaken every day for two weeks, when it 
may be poured off ready for use. 

TO STOP BLEEDING 

If the blood comes from a wound in jets or spirts be quick 
or the person may bleed to death in a few minutes, because 
the artery is severed. Tie a handkerchief loosely around 
near the part between the wound and the heart. Put a 
stick between the handkerchief and the skin, and twist it 
around, tightening the handkerchief until the blood ceases 
to flow, and keep in that position until the physician arrives. 
If in a position where the handkerchief cannot be used 
press the thumb on a spot near the wound, between the 
wound and heart ; increase the pressure until the bleeding 
ceases, but do not lessen the pressure for an instant, until 
the physician arrives. 

TO RESUSCITATE THE DROWNED 

As soon as the body is removed from the water, press the 
chest suddenly and forcible downward and backward and 
instantly discontinue the pressure. Repeat this without in- 
termission until a pair of bellows can be procured. When 
obtained, introduce the nozzle well upon the tongue, sur- 
round the mouth with a handkerchief or towel and close it. 
Direct a bystander to press firmly on the projecting part of 
the throat, called Adam's apple, and use the bellows gently 
and regularly, and each time the lungs are inflated with the 
bellows press upon the chest to expel the air from the lungs 
to imitate natural breathing. Continue this an hour at 
least, until signs of natural breathing come on. Wrap the 
body in warm blankets, and place it near the fire, and do 
everything to preserve the natural warmth as well as to im- 
part artificial heat if possible. Avoid all friction until 
respiration is in some degree established. It is best to send 
for medical aid immediately. 



552 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS 

If any poison is swallowed, drink immediately a half-glass 
of tepid water with a heaping teaspoonful each of common 
salt and ground mustard. This vomits as soon as it reaches 
the stomach, but for fear that some of the poison may still 
remain, swallow the white of one or two eggs, or drink a 
cup of strong black coffee these two being antidotes for 
a greater number of poisons than any other dozen articles 
known, with the advantage of their always being at hand. 
For oil of vitriol or aquafortis, give large doses of magnesia 
and water. For ammonia, give vinegar freely. For oxalic 
acid, give magnesia or chalk and water, administered in 
large and frequently-repeated doses. For saltpetre, give an 
emetic of mustard and water, afterwards mucilage and 
small doses of laudanum. For opium or laudanum, give 
an emetic of mustard and water; use constant motion, 
and, if possible, a stomach pump ; also, strong, black 
coffee. For arsenic, doses of magnesia are useful, but 
freshly-prepared hydrated oxide of iron is best. For insects 
taken into the stomach, give small quantities of vinegar and 
salt. For corrosive sublimate, give the whites of eggs mixed 
with water until free vomiting takes place. 

FOR BURNS 

Lime water and sweet oil well mixed in equal quantities is 
one of the very best remedies for a burn. Lime and lard, 
well mixed, are also good. 



TO REMOVE IRON MOULD FROM LINEN 

Rub the iron mould over with sulphuret of potash, then 
bathe it well in citric acid (lemon juice) and afterwards 
wash it well in water. 



TO REMOVE INK STAINS FROM LINEN 

Bathe the stains freely with lemon juice, sprinkle thickly with 
fine salt, and place in the sun a few hours. 



GATHERED CRUMBS 553 

TO TAKE OUT MILDEW 

Wet the article and rub on it equal parts of soap and chalk 
mixed together, then place in the sun until the spots dis- 
appear. 

STARCH FOR DARK CALICOES 

Make starch as usual, and add to it one pint of perfectly 
clear coffee. Strain and add a tiny piece of spermaceti. 

The color may be set in doubtful calicoes by dipping 
them in a strong solution of salt and water before washing. 

TO MEND CHINA 

Take a very thick solution of gum arabic and water, and 
stir into it plaster of paris until the mixture becomes a 
viscous paste. Apply it with a brush to the fractured edges 
and stick them together. In three days the article cannot 
be broken in the same place. The whiteness of this cement 
renders it doubly valuable. 

TO KEEP LEMONS 

Cover with cold water, changing it every week. This 
makes them ripe and juicy. 

MISCELLANEOUS 

Cranberries will keep all winter in a keg of water. 

Clean brass kettles before using with salt and vine- 
gar, to avoid being poisoned by the verdigris. 

A few drops of oil of lavender here and there through 
a bookcase will save a library from mould. 

To cleanse articles made of white zephyr, rub in flour 
and magnesia, changing often. Shake off the flour and 
hang the article in the sun. 

Spots in calico or cloth produced by an acid may be 
restored by touching the spots with spirits of hartshorn. 
Spots produced by an alkali may be removed by moisten- 
ing them with vinegar or tartaric acid. 

To clean velvet and make it look like new, invert a hot 
flat-iron, put over it a thickness of wet muslin, lay on this 
the velvet, wrong side next to the muslin, and brush the 
velvet gently as it steams, drawing it over the iron. 



HOW 



TO LARD 

Larding pork should be salt, solid, and clear fat without 
any streaks of lean. Cut into thin even slices, and cut 
these slices into long narrow strips, that will fit the larding- 
needle you intend to use. For Beef a la Mode the lardoons 
should be about the size of a lead-pencil. For veal, turkey, 
chicken, birds or sweetbreads, they should be about half 
that size. About one inch from the rind of the pork you 
will notice a decided mark or streak ; below this and near- 
est the rind, is the muscular part of the pork, and the only 
part that can be used for larding. Above this the pork is 
so tender that it will break when you put it in the needle. 
After you cut these strips (lardoons they are now called), 
put them into a bowl of very cold water to harden. Place 
one lardoon into the slot end of the larding-needle as far 
as it will go, thrust the needle into the meat, taking a stitch 
about one inch deep, push the needle through, place the fin- 
ger lightly on the strip of pork, and draw the needle out, 
leaving the pork exposed about a quarter-inch at each end 
of the stitch, and so continue until you have finished. 

TO LARD WITH TRUFFLES 

Cut the truffles into tiny blocks, insert the truffle-needle (a 
hollow needle with a sharp point and a wire rod to push 
the truffle through) under the skin, and just a little into 
the flesh. Now put a block of the truffle into the large end 
of the needle and push it through into the meat with the 
wire rod, and so continue until you have finished. 

(554) 



HOW 555 

TO FRY 

Frying, though one of the most common of the culin- 
ary operations, is one that is least commonly performed 
perfectly well. It often results in burning the outside, 
while the inside is cold, or serving the article in a coat- 
ing of grease. It is very important, that the oil, lard, 
or dripping should be very hot (about 360 Fahr.) before 
the article is put in. We cannot insist too strongly on this 
point. There should be sufficient fat to immerse the article 
to be fried. If too many things are put in the fat at one 
time they will be badly fried, because the temperature of 
the fat will quickly fall l>elow the point necessary to fry 
properly. The most successful frying is when the tempera- 
ture rises four or five degrees during the frying. The tem- 
perature of the fat should vary according to the nature of 
the things fried. To ascertain when it is of the proper 
heat without a thermometer, throw in a little bit of bread, 
if it browns quickly the fat is ready; if it burns the bread, 
it is too hot. Fish, potatoes, croquettes and rissoles, re- 
quire the fat quite hot, say about 385 Fahr., doughnuts, 
crullers and fritters 300 to 320 Fahr. 

A wire frying-basket is very convenient for frying cro- 
quettes, potatoes, etc. 

TO BLANCH ALMONDS 

Shell them, throw them into boiling water, and let stand 
on the back part of the stove five minutes, then throw them 
into cold water, and rub them between the hands to remove 
the skins. 

TO SALT ALMONDS 

Shell, blanch and spread them out on a bright tin pie dish, 
add a piece of butter the size of a hickory-nut, and stand 
them in a moderate oven until a golden brown. Take 
them from the oven, stir them around, dredge them thickly 
with salt, and turn out to cool. 

TO FILL ORANGES WITH JELLY 

Cut a small round piece of the skin from the stem end, 
then with your finger loosen the pulp from the skin and 
gradually work your finger between the skin and pulp until 
you have it entirely loosened. Now draw the pulp out 



556 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

through the opening without breaking the skin. Throw 
the skins into cold water until wanted. Have ready an 
Orange or Wine Jelly, drain the orange skins, fill them with 
the jelly, and stand away to cool. When cold, cut them 
into halves and then into quarters, and arrange them on a 
pretty dish, garnished with smilax. 

TO MAKE ORANGE BASKETS 

Mark out with a knife a basket and handle on the skin of 
a large orange, then cut it out, loosen the pulp and remove 
without breaking the skin. Throw the baskets into cold 
water one or two hours to stiffen. Make a Port and Lemon 
Jelly, and turn into square moulds to harden. When hard, 
cut into blocks and fill the baskets. Stand the baskets on 
a pretty dish, garnished with smilax and roses. 

TO GLACE" FRUITS 

Have the fruit perfectly dry. If oranges, separate carefully 
each carpel without breaking the inner skin. Stand them 
in a warm place to dry. Put one pound of granulated 
sugar in a porcelain-lined kettle, add to it a half-cup of 
water, and stand over the fire to boil. Do not stir after 
the sugar is dissolved. After the mixture has been boiling 
about ten minutes, hold the forefinger and thumb in ice- 
water for a minute, then quickly dip up a little of the boil- 
ing syrup with them ; press the thumb and finger tightly 
together, then draw them apart ; if the syrup forms a thread, 
it is at the second degree. Boil gently about three or four 
minutes longer until it reaches the sixth degree. This may 
be known by taking a small portion on the end of a spoon, 
then dipping it into cold water, and breaking it off quickly ; 
if it is brittle, without being at all sticky, it is just right. 
The syrup must never be stirred, or it will cause granula- 
tion. Now take it quickly from the fire, add a tablespoonful 
of lemon juice, stand in a basin of boiling water, to keep 
the syrup from candying. Take the fruit on the point of a 
large skewer or with sugar tongs, dip into the syrup, lay on 
a piece of buttered paper, and stand in a warm dry place 
to dry. 

English walnuts and almonds are glaced in the same 
manner. 



HOW 557 

TO CLEAN CURRANTS 

Add one cup of flour to every quart of currants and rub 
them well between the hands. This will free them from 
stones and stems. Then turn them into a colander and 
skake until the stems have passed. Now put them in a pan 
of cold water, wash thoroughly, drain and wash again. 
Spread on boards or flat dishes, and stand in a warm place 
to dry. When dry they are ready to use. 

TO WHIP CREAM 

Very thick cream should have an equal quantity of new 
milk added to it before being whipped. But moderately 
thick cream will whip nicely if ice cold. If you have a 
small crank churn (you can get them that will hold about 
two quarts), pour the cream into the churn and turn the 
dasher steadily for about three minutes, and the cream will 
be whipped all the way to the bottom. If you use the 
ordinary whip churn, have the cream in a tin pail, placed 
in a pan of ice-water. Stand a colander in a bowl or basin. 
Put the whip churn into the cream, hold it with the left 
hand, tilt slightly, that it may not stand flatly on the bot- 
tom of the pail ; now with right hand draw the dasher up 
quickly, then press it down hard, then up and down again, 
and so on. When the pail is full, skim off the froth and 
lay it in the colander to drain, and so continue until you 
have whipped all the cream. 

When whipped cream is to be served alone as a dessert 
or as a garnish for Bavarian creams and other desserts, it 
should be flavored before whipping. 

TO MAKE A PASTRY-BAG 

Fold a piece of very strong muslin (one foot square) from 
two opposite corners. Fell the edges tightly together, thus 
forming a triangular bag. Cut off the point to make an 
opening large enough to insert a tin pastry tube. It is bet- 
ter to have two or three pastry bags, each fitting their own 
respective tubes. 

TO USE THE PASTRY-BAG 

Put the tin tube into the bag and fit it into the opening. 
Fill the bag with the mixture, close the top of the bag, 



558 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

give it a twist, and hold it tightly with the right hand. 
Put the point of the tube close to the place where the 
mixture is to be spread. Press with the left hand, and 
guide the mixture into any shape desired, eclairs, lady- 
fingers, etc. 

TO MAKE A JELLY-BAG 

Take one yard of thick all-wool flannel, fold the two oppo- 
site corners together, fell the side, making a triangular bag. 
Bind the top with heavy tape, and fasten on the upper side 
two or three heavy loops by which it may be hung up. 

TO THAW MEAT OR POULTRY 

Stand in a warm room several hours before cooking. 

TO BOIL WATER 

Wash out the tea-kettle thoroughly, fill it with fresh cold 
water, stand it over a quick fire and bring to boiling point. 
Use at its first bubbles, or it parts with its gases and be- 
comes flat. 

TO CLARIFY FAT 

A careful cook seldom buys lard ; she saves all the skim- 
ming from soup, all trimmings from steaks, and the drip- 
ping from roasts. Put the dripping to be clarified into a 
saucepan, set it over a moderate fire until all the fat is 
melted ; then strain into a clean pan, and add to every 
three pounds of this fat a pint of boiling water and a quar- 
ter-teaspoonful of baking-soda. Stand over a moderate 
fire, and boil until the water has evaporated and the fat is 
clear. Skim, strain through a fine sieve into a tin kettle, 
and it is ready to use. 

TO SCALD MILK 

Put the milk in a basin or farina boiler, stand it in a pan 
of boiling water over the fire, and as soon as the milk be- 
gins to steam it is scalded. 

TO MAKE VANILLA-SUGAR 

One pound of granulated sugar and one ounce of vanilla 
bean. Cut the beans into halves, then into small pieces; 



HO IV 559 

put them into a mortar with the sugar, and pound until per- 
fectly fine. Sift through a hair sieve, and keep in glass 
jars closely corked. 

TO MAKE GUMBO FILLET POWDER 

Take the very young tender leaves of the sassafras, spread 
them out on white paper, and dry in a cool, dry, airy place. 
When dry, pound in a mortar, press through a hair sieve, 
and keep in a closely corked bottle. 

TO MAKE CARAMEL 

Put one cup of granulated sugar in an iron or granite 
saucepan, stir it over the fire until it melts and burns. As 
soon as it begins to smoke and boil, add one cup of boil- 
ing water; let it boil one minute, turn in a bottle, and 
cork tightly. 

This is used for coloring soups, sauces, and puddings. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR 

Put the desired quantity of sugar and water on to boil ; 

mix with a small portion of cold water the white of one 

egg, add it to the boiling syrup. Bring to boiling point, 
skim, and strain. 

HOW TO PULL CANDY 

After boiling candy, turn it on a marble slab or a large 
meat-plate to cool. When cool, but not cold, grease your 
hands lightly with olive oil or butter, take the candy in 
your hands, throw it over a large hook and pull it towards 
you, and so continue until the candy is creamy. Make 
the candy move, and not your hands, or you will blister 
them quickly. 

TO USE A SALAMANDER 

A salamander is a round iron plate, to which is attached a 
long handle. It is used to brown the surface of dishes 
that cannot be placed in the oven. Heat it red hot and 
then pass it over the top of the dish, being careful not to 
hold it too close, or it will scorch. A very good salaman- 
der is made from an ordinary iron fire-shovel. 



SUITABLE COMBINATIONS 
OF FOOD 



Man has not only to complete and repair the structure 
which constitutes his body, but has also to create heat in 
more or less abundance according to the climate in which 
he lives ; consequently to keep the body in a perfectly 
healthy condition, he must employ a wise combination of 
food. In perfect health he requires no rules. Nature 
teaches him how to live. But deviations from the laws of 
nature, blunt his instincts so that he can hardly tell what 
nature is, and tempt him, not only to take greater quanti- 
ties of food than his economy requires, but also of a more 
stimulating nature. Idleness, want of mental occupation, 
and self-indulgence often lead to over-feeding, and the im- 
moderate use of alcoholic stimulants. 

Food requirements vary with such wide limits in dif- 
ferent individuals and different occupations that it is almost 
impossible to lay down a general rule as to the quantity of 
food required. In some persons the process of digestion is 
so rapid that frequent meals are required, and if food is not 
taken when the digestive organs call for it, a sensation of 
sickening and faintness comes on and the appetite is lost. 

In prisons or in the army, where all men breath the 
same atmosphere and follow the same occupation, it is pos- 
sible to establish approximately the amount of food re- 
quired. In Edinburg, where a hundred prisoners were con- 
fined, experiments were made to ascertain the smallest 
amount of food required to keep the weight and strength 
(560) 



SUITABLE COMBINATIONS OF FOOD 561 

of man in idleness. Seventeen ounces of food per day for 
two months was given each man ; four ounces were muscle - 
making or nitrogenous food ; the remaining thirteen ounces 
heat and force-producing or carbonaceous food. During 
this time eighteen men lost one and a half pounds each, 
eighty-two held their own or gained weight. The same 
experiment was tried in Dundee, but there they gave 
molasses with their oatmeal instead of milk, as was given at 
Edinburg. Fifty of their prisoners lost five pounds each, 
while the remaining fifty held their own or gained weight. 
By these and other statistics we find that the system requires 
nearly five times as much carbonaceous as nitrogenous food. 

A thorough acquaintance with these facts cannot be 
too highly estimated. Two-thirds of all the intemperance 
in the land is due to ill and unscientific feeding. When I 
say ill-fed, I do not mean the poor who have scanty nour- 
ishment, but also that class who indulge their acquired and 
unnatural appetites in highly seasoned and over-nitrogenous 
foods. We must keep steadily before us the principle that 
it is not the quantity of food received which nourishes the 
body, but the proportion that can be digested of such food, 
all else is worse than waste, whose presence clogs and 
throws out of order the delicate digestive organs. A man 
may eat tijl he can take no more and still have an unsatisfied 
feeling. His food has not been properly proportioned. 
Each organ requires different elements, and each has the 
power of taking up from the mass such as are required by 
them and rejecting all others. 

While we take food in the proportions to satisfy each 
organ, peace and harmony prevail in the system, but let us 
indulge in over or improper feeding, an excitement is at 
once produced, and each organ makes an effort to reject its 
enemy, and the whole system becomes "out of order," and 
still we cannot read this lesson of nature, teaching us to 
keep out of our stomachs everything but the proper 
elements. How few there are who know why we serve 
potatoes or rice with lean beef, why we put butter on our 
bread, why it is better to eat sugar and cream on oatmeal 
and grits, why we eat more fruit and less meat in summer 
than in winter and vice versa. 



562 PHILADELPHIA COOK BOOK 

To nourish ourselves properly, we must bear in mind 
that during the process .of life we use up and cast away 
matter which must be replaced by equal substances, and 
we must find these supplies among such substances as con- 
tain in them some of our own elements. Albumen must 
be replaced by albumen, fibrin by fibrin ,, etc. 

For convenience, here, we will divide our food into 
three classes: nitrogenous, carbonaceous (organic), and 
the inorganic foods. The nitrogenous foods, as the name 
indicates, contain nitrogen. They have for their basis albu- 
men, fibrin, gluten and casein. The principal foods of 
this class are of animal origin, and eggs and milk. They 
also exist in some vegetables, as gluten and legumen in 
wheat, lentils and peas. This class contains a large amount 
of nutriment, of such material as is easily converted into 
living tissue. These foods are all digested in the stomach, 
consequently, should not be given in conditions in which 
this organ needs rest. Belonging to the carbonaceous foods 
are the starches, sugars and fats. The first two are of vege- 
table origin, while the latter is produced by vegetables and 
animals. The chief use of this class is to give heat and 
force to the body, and constitutes about three-fourths of 
our food. Consequently, if we wish to develop our mus- 
cles, we must eat lean beef (nitrogenous) ; if we wish to 
fortify ourselves against cold, we must eat fat. The car- 
bonaceous foods, being fat-formers, should not be taken in 
larger quantities than the economy requires by persons cor- 
pulently inclined. 

The third class, the inorganic foods water, salt, phos- 
phate of lime and iron, cannot in themselves support life, 
yet we could not live without them. Water enters into the 
composition of all the body's tissues. Salt is found in 
almost all our natural foods, but not in sufficient quantity 
to supply the demand of the system. Iron exists in both 
animal and vegetable foods in sufficient quantity to supply 
the economy in perfect health. Phosphate of lime is also 
supplied in both animal and vegetable foods in sufficient 
quantity when the system is in perfect health ; and thus it 
is seen that each sort of food must fulfill one or more of 
the body's requirements ; and, as a large proportion of the 



TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 563 

food we consume must be composed of carbon and hydro- 
gen, and is burnt up in the capillary tissues to create heat 
and force, this class represented by potatoes, rice, oils and 
sugars must be taken in larger quantities than lean beef, 
eggs, etc. Bartholow says : " The food supplies to the or- 
ganism may be so managed as to secure very definite therapeu- 
tical results, and by employment of a special and restricted 
method of feeding, cures may be effected not attainable by 
medicinal treatment,"

By the late JOHN CROMBIE BROWN, with an 
Introduction by CHARLES GORDON AMES.

writings."

COPE Theology of Evolution 

A Leaure by E. D. COPE, A. M., Ph. D.

RORER Philadelphia Cook Book 

By MRS. S. T. RORER, Principal of the 
Philadelphia Cooking School. Every 
recipe has been repeatedly tried and suc- 
cessfully made. The book is practical, 
sensible and thoroughly reliable. It con- 
tains chapters on Dinner-giving, To Cooks, 
What to Save and How to Use it, Kitchen 
and Pantry, Combinations of Foods, etc.; 
it comments on ways of cooking, the 
selection of things to be cooked, and the 
utensils to cook them with.

and elaborate index ; oil-cloth covers, $1.75 

RORER Hot Weather Dishes 

In this attractively printed volume Mrs. 
Rorer presents a tempting array of season- 
able dishes for the hot weather. Even 
old housekeepers are wont to feel a cer- 
tain amount of embarrassment over the 
arrangement of the proper things for sum- 
mer living. To all her fellow housewives 
the author sends this little directory as a 
helpmate.

RORER Canning and Preserving 

In this little volume Mrs. Rorer discusses 
at length the canning and preserving of 
fruits and vegetables, with the kindred 
subjects of marmalades, butters, fruit jellies 
and syrups, drying and pickling. As in 
her large work, the Philadelphia Cook 
Book, the recipes are clearly and simply 
given, while an exhaustive index affords 
easy reference to every subject. 

i2mo, with index ; bound in cloth, 75 cents ; 
paper covers, 40 cents 

SAVAGE Evolution and Religion 

From the Standpoint of one who Believes 
in Both. A Lecture by MINOT J. SAVAGE. 
Second edition. The handsome pamphlet 
of 52 pages which contains his address is a 
notable addition to the literature of recent 
discussion, not so much from any novelty 
in its ideas as from the extraordinary clear- 
ness and vigor of their putting. Mr. Savage 
seems not to use his opportunity chiefly 
for the vindication of Evolution, which he 
claims has passed beyond the need of de- 
fence, but to exhibit what he considers the 
absurdity of its theological opponents. 

i2mo, wide margins, uncut ; 25 cents
