PREFACE. 



THIS little book is the result of twenty years' experi- 
ence, on the part of the author, in housekeeping. The 
receipts which it contains were, in great part, originally 
written down for her own convenience ; others from time 
to time have been added, with the hope that they might 
be of service to her daughters. She has been led to 
suppose that they might be made useful to others, also ; 
and for this reason, with the advice and encouragement 
of those on whom she ought to rely, they are now pub- 
lished. 

Without comparing this book with any other works of 
a similar character, it is thought that it proposes the three 
following characteristics : 

1. It contains no receipt which the author has not her- 
self tried and proved, experimentally, to be good. 

2. It contains a sufficient number of receipts to meet 
all the ordinary wants of a family. 

3. A third object kept constantly in view has been to 
provide receipts, which will enable one to furnish a table 
handsomely, at the smallest expense. 

Great attention has been given to the last point. Few- 
persons are aware what a difference the mode of cooking 
makes in the cost of a year's housekeeping. Without any 



IV PREFACE. 

increase of expenditure, one person, by means of good 
receipts, skilfully used, and by a tasteful arrangement of 
the table, will make a feast out of the articles of food 
which would have hardly sufficed another for the most 
indifferent meal. There are housekeepers whose table, 
notwithstanding great extravagance, is always disorderly 
and uninviting. They do not know ho\v to make use 
of their materials, and they never get beyond a coarse, 
uninviting abundance. There are others, who, with the 
cheapest materials, and with very limited means, through 
good taste, good judgment, and good cooking, have always 
a table richly and handsomely furnished. 

In this, and in other respects, the intention has been to 
prepare a work for practical use. One of the greatest 
conveniences to a young housekeeper, is a COOK-BOOK, on 
the excellence of whose directions she may rely ; while 
few things embarrass her more than one which is filled, 
not with a selection, but with an indiscriminate collection 
of receipts, good, bad, and indifferent, brought together 
hap-hazard, without any reference to their real value. 
This book has at least the negative merit of containing 
nothing inserted merely to swell the size of the volume ; 
and it is believed that it may claim the positive merit of 
containing good and economical rules, sufficient to meet 
any wants which are likely to occur in the common round 
of a housekeeper's life.

RECEIPTS 



PLAIN BREAD AND CAKE. 

YEAST. 

ONE handful of hops, boiled half an hour in two 
quarts of water ; ten good potatoes boiled half an 
hour, and mashed very fine. Strain the water 
from the hops on to the potatoes, very hot j stir in 
two table-spoonsful of salt, and one pint of flour ; 
set it to cool. When lukewarm add one pint of 
good brewer's yeast, and let it rise six hours. 
Strain all through a cullender or sieve ; put into 
a stone jug stopped tight. It will keep three weeks 
in winter, and one week in summer. 

BREAD. 

Three quarts of flour, half a cup of yeast, one 
table-spoonful of salt, warm water enough to make 
it into dough. .Knead this until it is perfectly 
smooth. Be sure to get all the flour off the sides 
of the pan ; set it in a warm place to rise at night ; 
in the morning dissolve one teaspoonful of salera- 
tus in a little warm water ; knead this well into

doush, divide it into two loaves, and bake, in a 

c^ ) 

tolerable hot oven, about three quarters of an hour. 
A pint of Indian meal scalded, and mixed in 
with the flour, is by some persons considered an 
improvement.* 

THIRD BREAD. 

One pint of rye meal, one pint of Indian meal, 
scalded, one pint of wheat flour, half a cup of 
yeast : mix it up with warm water into a stiff 
dough ; set it to rise eight hours. Bake it either 
in loaves or biscuit : wet the hands in cold water 
to put it into pans. Bake it in a hot oven forty 
minutes. 

BROWN BREAD. 

Two quarts of Indian meal ; two quarts of rye 
meal ; one large spoonful of salt ; half a teacupful 
of yeast ; half a cup of molasses ; mix it with as 
warm water as the hands will bear ; butter deep 
pans ; wet the hands with cold water, to put it in } 
set it to rise one hour. Bake it in a hot oven four 
or five hours ; if baked in a brick oven, it is better 
to keep it in the oven all night. 

BISCUIT. 

Two quarts of flour ; about two ounces of but- 
ter ; half a pint of boiling water ; one teaspoonful 

* If salcratus is objected to, it may be omitted; but in my 
experience, the small quantity that I use does not affect the wheat 
otherwise than to make the bread more tender.

SOUPS. 

A CALF'S HEAD SOUP. 

THE head should be soaked in cold water, and 
washed very clean ; to a large head take six quarts 
of water ; boil it four hours ; (the head may be 
dressed for dinner by directions on page 38 ;) strain 
the liquor into a stone jar, and set it away to cool 
over night, or until the fat cools ; then skim off the 
fat ; take two quarts of the liquor, one dozen cloves, 
one dozen pepper-corns, salt, two onions, two car- 
rots, and two turnips cut fine ; boil this two hours ; 
cut into small pieces what you have left of the 
head, or as much as is required, put it into a sauce- 
pan, with the rest of the stock, and boil it one hour ; 
strain the liquor in which the vegetables were boiled 



SOUPS. 7 

into this, and let it boil an hour and a half; then 
add three spoonsful of browned flour, braided into 
half a pound of butter and a pint of red wine ; give 
it one boil. Have ready some force-meat balls, 
made of some of the head and brains, chopped fine 
and seasoned with pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet 
herbs, mixed very hard with two eggs, and fried in 
hot butter, also six eggs boiled hard, and two lemons 
sliced ; put the force-meat balls, lemon, the yolk of 
the eggs, and three table-spoonsful of soy, into the 
bottom of the tureen ; then turn the soup on this, 
and send it to the table very hot. All this will 
make about five quarts of soup. 

GUMBO SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal and an old fowl ; put them 
into a soup pot with two carrots and two turnips 
sliced, an onion whole, and six quarts of water ; 
boil it five hours ; take out the chicken, and cut it 
into small pieces ; cut two onions up in slices, fry 
them brown in butter ; then take out the onion, 
and put in the pieces of chicken and fry them 
brown ; put the onions into a saucepan, shake a 
little flour into the hot butter, stirring it all the 
time ; care should be taken that this does not oil 
or burn. When this is done, put it in with the 
chicken ; strain the soup into it, and boil it half an 
hour. Take three quarts of oysters, wash them 
out of the liquor, strain the liquor into the soup, 
put the oysters in, and let it boil up once ; mix 
three table-spoonsful of gumbo in half a pint of cold 



8 RECEIPTS. 

water ; stir this in the soup, while the the soup is 
boiling, but do not let it boil after the gumbo is 
put in. 

Send to the table with the soup, a dish of boiled 
rice to eat with it ; a spoonful of it should be served 
with each plate of soup. 

PEA SOUP. 

Put one quart of peas to soak over night in soft 
water ; the next morning wash them out, and put 
them into a soup pot with two carrots, two onions, 
a stock of celery, and four quarts of water ; let this 
boil four or five hours ; (have boiling water at 
hand to add, as the water boils away much faster 
in pea soup than any other kind ; strain the soup 
through a very coarse sieve ; have a piece of salt 
pork boiled in another pot one hour ; then take it 
out and skin it ; put the soup and the pork back 
into the pot, and boil it gently one hour, frequently 
stirring it with a large spoon ; great care should be 
taken that it does not scorch. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal, put it into a pot with three 
quarts of water, two carrots and two onions cut up, 
pepper and salt ; boil it three hours, then strain it

SOUPS. 9 

oysters, and a tumbler and a half of white wine ; 
give it one boil, and send it to the table very hot.

tion of the wine ; instead of which, put a pint and 
a half of cream and stir all the time until it is 
dished. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 

Take a shin of veal, two carrots, two onions, pep- 
per, salt, mace, and four quarts of water. Boil it 
three or four hours. Break up a large lobster, take 
the meat out of the shell, break the shell up, and 
put it into a saucepan with water enough to cover 
it. Let this simmer while the soup is boiling ; then 
strain all this, and put it back into the soup pot ; 
cut the lobster very fine, and put it into the soup ; 
and boil it two hours. If you have the row of 
coral of the lobster, grate it and put it into the 
soup ; it adds very much to the appearance of the 
soup. Add a quarter of a pound of butter, braided 
into two spoonsful of flour, a cup of white wine, 
and a spoonful of vinegar or the juice of a lemon. 

VERY GOOD SOUPS 

May be made with very little expense. In the 
winter you can keep cold meat and poultry bones 
several days, until you have enough to make a 
very nice stock, or the water that mutton, chicken, 
or turkey is boiled in. Let it stand in an earthen 
jar, and it will keep in cold weather two or three 
days. 



10 RECEIPTS. 

A VERY SIMPLE SOUP. 

Skim off the fat from mutton or chicken stock, 
put it into a soup pot with two or three carrots, tur- 
nips and onions, a cup of rice, the bones and bits 
of cold meat, pepper, salt, and a few tomatoes if 
you have them. Boil it four hours ; then take out 
the bones and send it to the table. 

A ROAST BEEF AND BOILED TURKEY SOUP. 

Take the liquor that the turkey is boiled in, and 
the bones of the turkey and beef, put them into a 
soup pot with two or three carrots, turnips, and 
onions, half a dozen cloves, pepper, salt, and toma- 
toes if you have any. Boil it four hours, then 
strain all out. Put the soup back into the pot, 
mix two table-spoonsful of flour in a little cold 
water ; stir it into the soup ; give it one boil ; cut 
some bread dice-form, lay it in the bottom of the 
tureen, pour the soup on to it, and color it with a 
little soy. 

ROAST VEAL AND CHICKEN-BONES 

Make a very nice soup boiled with vegetables 
as the above ; but add a handful of macaroni, 
break it up fine, and boil the soup half an hour 
after it is put in. Color the soup with a little soy 
or catsup. 

ROAST VENISON SOUP. 

Break up the bone, put it into a soup pot with 
about four quarts of water, carrots, onions, pep- 



SOUPS. 11 

per, salt, and cloves. Boil it three hours, then strain 
it. Take half a pound of butter braided in three 
spoonsful of flour and stir into the soup ; let it 
boil up once ; then add half a pint of red wine ; 
cut some pieces of toasted bread in dice-form, and 
lay in the bottom of the tureen. Turn the soup 
on to it. 

TO MAKE STOCK FOR WHITE SOUP AND GRAVIES. 

Put two knuckles or shins of veal, two onions, 
two table-spoonsful of salt, into eight quarts of 
water. Boil this six hours ; strain it into a stone 
jar, and keep it in a cold place. When it is cold, 
take off the fat.* 

WHITE SOUP. 

Take as much of the stock as you think you 
want, put it into a saucepan with one or two car- 
rots and turnips, one onion, a little rice or vermi- 
celli, and about one fourth as much water as you 
have stock ; a very little mace, pepper, and salt is 
required. Boil this one hour. Take out the veg- 
etables, and serve it with the rice or vermicelli 
only. 

A WHITE VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take a third as much water as you want soup ; 

* This is very useful to put into any kind of white meat soups, 
gravies, and pies. There should be great care taken to skim all 
kinds of soups, particularly those made of fresh meat. The scum 
rises very thick just before it begins to boil, and that is the proper 
time to skim it. 



12 RECEIPTS. 

two carrots, two turnips, and two onions, cut them 
in dice-form ; a very little celery, a table-spoonful 
of salt, and a little mace. Put this all into a sauce- 
pan, boil it one hour, add the two-thirds of stock. 
Boil this all together three-quarters of an hour. If 
it is not seasoned to your taste, add whatever is 
required. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Put a shin of veal, one onion, two carrots, two 
turnips, and a little salt, into four quarts of water. 
Boil this three hours ; add two cups of vermicelli, 
and boil it an hour and a half longer. Before serv- 
ing, take out the bone and vegetables. 

ANOTHER WHITE SOUP. 

Make soup as above. Beat up two or three eggs 
and put into the tureen ; then strain the soup 
through a sieve on to the eggs, stirring them all 
the time. Send it to the table immediately, or the 
eggs will settle if allowed to stand. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil a shin of veal three hours, or take some 
soup stock. Cut up two onions, two carrots, and 
two turnips, and put with it ; also pepper, salt, and 
one dozen tomatoes. Boil this two hours, and 
strain it through a sieve. Toast some pieces of 
bread a light brown, cut them in dice-form, and 
put them into the tureen. The soup should be 
turned on to the toast just before it is taken to the 
table, as soaking long spoils it. 



SOUPS. 13 

MUTTON BROTH. 

Boil a shoulder of mutton in four quarts of 
water two hours. Add one onion, two turnips, 
two carrots cut fine, one table-spoonful of salt, and 
one cup of rice. Boil this an hour and a half; cut 
a little parsley, and put it in five minutes before 
dishing. Dish the mutton with drawn butter and 
capers. Garnish the dish with carrots and turnips. 

TO MAKE STOCK FOE, BROWN SOUP. 

Take two shins of beef, a shin of veal, eight 
quarts of water, one dozen cloves, and one dozen 
pepper-corns. Boil this eight hours ; strain it into 
a stone jar, and when it is cold remove the fat. 

This is a very nice stock to use instead of water 
in making gravies for any kind of dark meat, such 
as beef, mutton, venison, and all kinds of wild 
fowl. 

A SHIN OF BEEF SOUP. 

It is better to have the beef boiled the day before 
the soup is wanted ; if that is not convenient, have 
the shin cracked up well, put it to boil in five or 
six quarts of water, boil it five or six hours, skim 
it very often ; cut up very fine half of a white 
cabbage, chop two turnips, three carrots, and three 
onions ; put them into the soup, with pepper and 
salt, and boil it two hours ; half an hour before 
serving take out the bone and gristle. If you have 
some raised dough, make up a dozen little balls the 
size of a nutmeg, and drop them into the soup, and 
boil it half an hour. 



14 RECEIPTS. 

OX-TAIL SOUP 

May be made as the above. Straining the veg- 
etables out, put the soup back into the pot ; mix a 
pint of thickening of flour and water, season it with

the pot ; mix a table-spoonful of flour with water, 
stir it into the soup, and let it boil ten minutes ; cut 
some pieces of toast fine, and put in.

hours ; cut in dice-form some carrots and turnips, 
chop up two onions and a head of celery, toast 
brown two slices of bread, put them all into the 
soup, and boil it two hours; then take out the meat 
if it is not quite brown enough, and add a little soy. 
This piece of meat makes a very nice dish next 
day. Cut up two carrots, one turnip, and two 
onions in dice-form ; put the meat and vegetables 
into a saucepan, and add pepper, salt, a little cloves, 
and just water enough to cover the meat ; stew it 
gently two or three hours ; take out the meat, 
mix a little flour in water, and two spoonsful of 
mixed mustard ; stir these into the gravy, give it

haddock weighing four pounds ; cut them in pieces 
about six inches square, wash them clean and wipe 
them dry, and dredge them with a little flour ; cut 
into slices about a quarter of a pound of salt pork 
and two onions ; fry the pork a nice brown in a 
pot large enough to make the soup in ; then take 
out the pork and fry the onions, and be careful 
not to burn them ; when these are done, put into 
the hot fat a layer of fish, then put in a little of 
the onion, a few bits of pork, a little pepper and

until the fish and seasoning are all in the pot ; split 
eight hard crackers, dip them into cold water, and 
lay them over the fish j put in hot water enough to 
cover the fish, and after it begins to boil, let it boil 
thirty minutes. Some like half milk and half 
water; if milk is used, the % tomato should be 
omitted ; for those who like spice, a little clove and 
mace, with a quart of red wine, is a great improve- 
ment. 

BOILED COD. 

The head and shoulders is considered the best to 
boil j lay it into cold water, with a handful of salt, 
and let it remain one hour ; then scrape and wash it 
clean, rub a little salt and cayenne pepper into the 
body, flour a cloth, pin the fish up tight, and put it 
into boiling water ; after it begins to boil, let it 
boil thirty minutes, or according to the size of the 
fish ; serve it with drawn butter or oyster sauce. 

BAKED COD. 

A fish weighing six or eight pounds is a good size 
to bake ; it should be cooked whole to look well. 
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, pars- 
ley, and onion, and a little salt pork chopped fine ; 
mix this up with one egg, fill the body, sew it up, 
lay it into a large pan ; lay across it some strips of

an inch apart upon the inside ; then butter the sides 
and bottom of a large stewpan, put the fish in skin

ten minutes ; when ready for serving, take the fish 
out carefully in a deep dish, the spiced side up, and 
pour the gravy over it. 

FRIED COD AND HADDOCK. 

Cut the fish in pieces about the size to help at 
table, wash and wipe them dry, roll them in Indian 
meal. Fry some pieces of salt pork ; take out the

same as smelts. They require a longer time to fry 
than smelts, being larger and thicker. 

Fresh cod's tongues, fried in the same way, are 
very nice. 

FRIED SALMON. 

Cut the salmon into slices half an inch thick, 
shake some flour over them, and fry them in butter, 
or in sweet oil, or with egg and crumbs, as smelts. 

FRIED HALIBUT

BOILED SALMON. 

Salmon should be well cleansed, but not soaked 
in water ; rub a little salt into the body, flour a 
cloth and pin it up, and put it into boiling water. 
For a piece weighing six pounds, after it begins to 
boil let it boil about half an hour. Serve it with 
drawn butter and eggs, or lemon fish sauce, or lob- 
ster sauce. 

BROILED SALMON. 

It may be either cut in slices, as fried salmon, or 
split to the tail ; broil it very quick, and when it is 
dished rub some butter over it. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Some like the tail best, but the next cut is nicest, 
and a much handsomer piece to dish. Rub a little 
salt over it, and lay it in cold water a little while ; 



FISH. 21 

then wash it and scrape it very clean, put it into a 
floured cloth, and then into boiling water. A piece 
weighing eight pounds would require thirty-five 
minutes to cook. 

BROILED HALIBUT. 

The nape, corned, is the best piece for broil- 
ing. Wash it, and wipe it dry, sprinkle a little 
flour over it ; put the outside to the fire first, and

TAUTOG, OR BLACK FISH. 



This fish is very hard to clean. Lay them in a 
pan, and pour boiling-hot water over them ; then 
scrape them very hard until you get off all the 
scales ; then wash and clean them in cold water. 
Let them lay in salt and water a while. Make a 
dressing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, a little clove, 
a great deal of parsley, one onion, and a little salt 
pork, chopped fine. Mix this all up with a little 
butter. Then stuff the fish, and sew it up ; put it 
into an iron pan, lay some strips of salt pork over it 
to flavor it, dredge on a little flour, and put into the 
pan a pint of water and a pint of red wine ; set it 
into the oven of the range, and do not quite close 
the door. Let it stew gently one hour and a half. 
Baste it very often with the wine and butter. 
When the fish is done, thicken the gravy with a 
little flour and butter ; give it one boil, and turn it 
over the fish. 

EELS. 

After they are skinned, turn boiling water over 
them, and let them remain about half an hour. To 
fry them, cut them up in pieces about six inches 
long, and fry them the same as codfish. 

BAKED EELS. 

Sprinkle some flour over them, and some pieces 
of butter ; put them into a pan with a little water, 
and bake them half an hour. When they are 
dished, make a gravy in the dish that they were

mustard, and catsup. Give it one boil, and turn it 
on the eels. 

SALT FISH, OR DUN FISH. 

If you wish to cook a fish whole, put it into the 
fish kettle with six or eight quarts of water at 
night ; the next morning wash it clean out of the 
water, wash out the kettle, put in the fish again, 
with as much clean water as at first, and set it so 
near the fire as to scald, but not to boil. One hour 
before dinner time, take the fish up into a pan of 
clean cold water, wash oif all the skin and fins, 
wash out the kettle again, and lay in the fish care- 
fully ; add fresh water, and set the kettle on the 
fire to boil thirty minutes ; dish it in a clean nap- 
kin, on a fish dish j to eat with drawn butter and 
pork scraps. 

To make what is called scraps, cut a quarter of 
a pound of fat salt pork into very small square 
pieces ; put it into a fry ing 'pan, stirring them fre- 
quently until the fat is extracted, and the scraps 
are done light brown. 

If you do not wish to cook a whole fish, cut it 
into pieces about eight inches square ; when dished, 
garnish with eggs boiled hard, and cut into slices, 
with boiled beets. Beets should always be served 
with salt fish. 

TO MINCE FISH. 

Chop the fish very fine ; chop half as much more 



24 RECEIPTS. 

boiled potatoes as fish ; fry out the pork as before 
stated ; mix the potatoes and fish together, put it 
into the hot fat, stir it up well, add a little hot 
water and a piece of butter the size of an egg ; stir 
it all up well until it gets very hot ; let it stand 
until it browns a little, and serve it hot ; or mince 
the fish as before directed, make it into balls, and 
fry them in pork or batter. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Wash a gallon of oysters : let the liquor stand 
and settle about ten minutes; strain it through a 
fine sieve into a saucepan ; add one third as much 
cold water as liquor, and a quarter of a pound of 
butter ; braid into it a little flour or cracker crumbs, 
and stir this into the liquor ; add a little cayenne 
pepper, and mace if liked, and boil this up ; add 
the oysters, toast half a dozen crackers, and butter 
them a little ; lay them into the oyster dish, and 
pour the oysters on to them. Before dishing, add 
a wine glass of white wine, or half a wine glass 



of vinegar. 



SCOLLOPED OYSTERS. 



Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters : 
pound very fine eight soft crackers, or grate a stale 
loaf of bread ; butter a deep dish, sprinkle in a 
layer of crumbs, then a layer of oysters ; a little 
mace, pepper, and bits of butter ; another layer of 
crumbs, another of oysters, then seasoning as before, 
and so on, until the dish is filled ; cover the dish 



FISH. 25 

over with bread crumbs, seasoning as before ; turn 
over it a cup of the oyster liquor, or a cup of white 
wine ; set it into the oven for thirty or forty min- 
utes to brown. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters, wash them clean out of the 
liquor, and wipe them dry ; dip them in eggs, and 
then in crumbs, and fry them in hot fat. 

A DISH OF COLD OYSTERS 

Is very nice in warm weather, to serve before 
meats instead of soup. 

OYSTER PIE. 

Wash out of the liquor two quarts of oysters ; 
season them with pepper, a little mace, a glass of 
white wine ; add a cup of very fine cracker crumbs, 
and some little bits of butter ; put them into the 
pie dish, lined with paste ; add half the liquor. 
The dish must be quite full, and covered with a 
rich puff paste ; baked until the crust is done. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line small patty-pans with a good paste ; cut 
some covers to the pans with a rich puff paste ; 
bake the crust on tin sheets ; wash a quart of oys- 
ters out of the liquor, and put them into a sauce- 
pan ; add a piece of butter the size of an egg, half 
a teaspoonful of mace, a wineglass-full of white 
wine, the juice of a lemon, and a very little flour ; 
give them one scald, stirring all the time ; fill the 



26 RECEIPTS. 

patties, put on the crust, and send to the table 
immediately, as the crusts should not get soaked 
before using them. 

STEWED LOBSTER. 

Take out all the meat and soft part from the 
body, and cut it up into small bits ; put them into 
a saucepan with two cups of white stock, a little 
mace, cayenne, and salt ; dredge in some flour, 
some bits of butter, and stew it about ten or fifteen 
minutes ; stir it frequently, and when done, add a 
little vinegar or white wine. 



MEATS. 

ROAST BEEF. 

A PIECE of beef weighing ten pounds, requires 
two hours to roast. Allow ten minutes to every 
pound over or under this weight. Do not put the 
meat too close to the fire at first. When half done 
turn the fat out of the roaster, then baste the meat 
with the drippings of the meat two or three times. 
Do not salt or flour it until nearly done. Just be- 
fore dishing, dredge on a little salt and flour, baste 
it well, and set it close to the fire to froth. 

The second cut of the sirloin, the second cut of 
the ribs, and the back of the rump, are considered 
the best parts for roasting. 



MEATS. 27 

TO MAKE A GOOD BEEF GRAVY. 

Take the drippings from the meat, turn it into 
a saucepan, and add a cup of boiling water ; shake 
in a little flour and salt, and let it just come to a 
boil, stirring it all the time ; add a table-spoonful 
of soy or tomato catsup. 

BEEF STEAK. 

A rump steak is the best ; a sirloin is the next 
best. To broil a steak requires a quick fire. If 
cooked by a range, it should be put in front, and 
not on the top. Never use a fork to turn the steak, 
nor salt it while cooking. 

A steak half an inch thick requires ten minutes, 
and one an inch thick requires fifteen minutes. 
Have ready a hot dish, put the steak upon it, and 
a little butter upon both sides ; salt and pepper to 
suit the taste ; adding a little tomato catsup to the 
gravy improves it. 

Waterman's patent gridiron is the best to use 
with a range. 

BEEF STEAK WITH OYSTER SAUCE. 

Cook the steak as above. Take the liquor of a 
quart of oysters, put it into a saucepan with about 
six ounces of butter mixed with a little flour, and 
let it come to a boil ; turn in the oysters ; let this 
boil up once ; turn it on the steak, and send it to 
the table very hot. 

BEEF STEAK WITH SMOTHERED ONIONS. 

Cook the beef steak as before directed. Cut up 



28 RECEIPTS. 

six onions very fine, put them into a saucepan with 
a cup of hot water, a piece of butter about the size 
of an egg, pepper, salt, and a little flour ; let it stew 
until the onions are quite soft ; turn this over the 
steak quite hot. 

ALAMODE BEEF. 

Take a piece of the round of beef, weighing 
about ten or twelve pounds ; tie it up with a strong 
string, in the form of a round. Take half a table- 
spoonful of pepper, one of salt, one of ground cloves, 
and two of sugar ; rub these all over the meat the 
night before it is to be cooked ; make a nice force- 
meat of half a brick loaf of crumbs, two sausages, 
one onion chopped fine, two table-spoonsful of 
sweet herbs, one of cloves, one of salt, half a one 
of pepper, and two eggs. Mix them well together. 
Make holes in your meat about two inches apart, 
fill them with the dressing, and sew them up. Stick 
an onion full of cloves, put it into the pot, and add 
one quart of water, and one quart of red wine. 
Place skewers in the pot about two inches from the 
bottom ; lay your beef on them ; cover the pot very 
tight, to prevent the steam from escaping. Let 
this stew gently four hours ; turn the meat two or 
three times while cooking ; turn a pint of red wine 
over the meat ; let it stew an hour longer ; thicken 
your gravy with a little flour and a little salt, skim 
off the fat, and boil it up once. Turn a part over 
your meat when dished, and send the remainder of 
it to U.ble in a sauce-tureen. 



MEATS. 29 

BOUILLI BEEF. 

Put a part of a brisket of beef, weighing six 
pounds, into a saucepan, and cold water enough to 
cover it. Let it boil until the scum rises, and skim 
it nicely ; add two carrots, two turnips, and one 
onion, cut in dice form ; stick an onion full of cloves. 
Let all this simmer three hours. Add one tumbler 
full of red wine, two teaspoonsful of mixed mus- 
tard, and one table-spoonful of soy. Let it simmer 
one hour. When done, sprinkle over it some pic- 
kled cucumbers, cut very fine ; stir a little flour into 
your gravy, give it one boil, turn it into the dish 
with the meat, and send it to the table very hot. 

A BEEF PIE. 

Take cold roast beef or steak, cut it into thin 
slices, and put a layer into a pie dish : shake in a 
little flour, pepper, and salt ; cut up a tomato (if you 
have it,) or onion chopped very fine ; then another 
layer of beef and seasoning, and so on until the 
dish is filled. If you have any beef gravy, put it 
in ; if not, a little beef drippings,- and water enough 
to make sufficient gravy. Have ready one dozen 
potatoes well boiled and mashed ; add half a cup of 
milk or cream, and a little butter and salt. Spread 
it over the pie as a crust, an inch thick ; brush it over 
with egg, and bake it about twenty-five minutes. 

BEEF OLIVES. 

Take a slice of the round of beef about an inch 
thick, beat it with a rolling pin to the thickness of 



30 RECEIPTS. 

half an inch, and cut it into four inch squares. 
Have ready some dressing, made of beef, a little 
salt pork, one onion chopped very fine, one cup of 
bread crumbs, pepper, salt, cloves, and sweet mar- 
joram. Mix all this up with an egg, put it into the 
pieces of steak, and sew them up in the form of 
olives ; lay them in a tin pan with a cup of brown 
stock, sprinkle a little flour over them, and set them 
in the oven. When half done, baste them with a 
little butter. They require about twenty minutes' 
cooking. Dish your olives ; add to the gravy half 
a cup of boiling water, a small piece of butter, a 
little flour, and two teaspoonsful of soy. Give this 
one boil, and turn it over the olives when ready to 
send to the table. 

TO PREPARE SPICED BEEF. 

Take -the brisket or rattleran, cut it into pieces 
about the size you wish to cook, rub it over with 
fine salt, a little sugar, cloves, allspice, pepper, and 
saltpetre ; roll the beef up tight and tie it. 

To thirty pounds of beef allow a cup of salt, a 
cup of spice, (the spice is not to be ground) apiece 
of saltpetre the size of a nutmeg broken fine ; pack 
the beef when prepared into a keg, add one quart 
of good vinegar, and enough beef brine to cover 
the beef ; let it stand about one week, when it will 
be fit for use. This will keep six months or 
more. 

Boil a piece of this beef, weighing eight pounds, 
six hours; press it eight hours; to be served cold. 



MEATS. 31 

TRIPE. 

The honey-comb part is the best ; it should be 
well-boiled. Cut it in square pieces of about six 
inches, wash it in salt and water, wipe it dry, dip it 
in eggs and crumbs, or batter, and fry it in hot fat. 
Serve it with oyster sauce. After dishing the tripe, 
turn a quart of oyster sauce over it. 

CORNED BEEF. 

The navel end of the brisket is the best piece to 
boil. It should be put into cold water. Just before 
it boils take the scum off. A piece of beef weigh- 
ing eight pounds requires five hours' boiling. Be- 
fore sending to the table, the bone should be taken 
out, and the beef pressed half an hour. If done 
so, it looks much nicer and cuts better. 

EDGE BONE OF BEEF 

Weighing ten pounds, should be boiled three 
hours, as this piece should be a little rare. 

BRISKET OF BEEF STUFFED. 

A piece weighing eight pounds requires about five 
or six hours to boil. Make a dressing of bread 
crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet herbs, a little mace, and 
one onion chopped fine and mixed with an egg. 
Put the dressing in between the fat and lean of the 
beef, and sew it up tight ; flour a cloth, pin the 
beef up very tight in it, boil it five or six hours. 
When it is done, take the cloth off, and press it 



32 KECEIPTS. 

until it is cold. This is to be cut in thin slices 
and eaten cold. 

SALTPETERED TONGUE 

Requires five or six hours to boil. When done, 
lay it into cold water three minutes ; peal off the 
skin, beginning at the tip end of the tongue, as it 
comes off much easier. 

BOUILLI TONGUE. 

Take a fresh beef tongue, and boil it two hours. 
Lay it into cold water about five minutes, skin it, 
and let it remain until the next day ; then dress it 
the same as bouilli beef. This makes a very nice 
dish. 

ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

A leg of mutton weighing ten pounds should be 
roasted two hours. When half done, turn the fat 
out of the roaster ; then what drips from the meat 
you baste the meat with. Make the gravy the 
same as for roast beef, or add a few spoonsful of 
currant jelly and a cup of red wine. Ten minutes 
more should be allowed for every extra pound of 
mutton. 

ROAST SADDLE OF MUTTON. 

A saddle of mutton, weighing eight pounds, re- 
quires three quarters of an hour to cook ; the gravy 
is made the same as for a leg of mutton. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON ROASTED, 

Weighing six pounds, requires one hour to roast ; 



MEATS. 33- 

if stuffed, half an hour longer. Before cooking it, 
take out the bone, and fill the space with a dress- 
ing of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, sweet marjoram^ 
one egg, and a small piece of butter. 

A LEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 

A leg of mutton, weighing ten pounds, requires 
an hour and a half to boil. Flour a cloth, tie the 
meat in it very tight, and put it into boiling water ; 
when done, put it into a pan and turn cold water 
over it, and let it remain two minutes before re- 
moving the cloth j this makes the mutton look 
very white. 

A SHOULDER OF MUTTON BOILED 

Is cooked in the same way as a leg, except that 
it takes a half an hour less time to boil, 

HARICOT MUTTON. 

Take a cold leg of boiled mutton, or a small one 
not boiled, and put it into a saucepan that covers 
close ; cut into dice-form two carrots, two turnips, 
and two onions ; put them around or under the 
mutton, add eight or ten cloves, pepper, salt, and 
water enough to cover the mutton ; simmer it four 
hours ; about half an hour before dishing, add a cup 
of white wine and two teaspoonsful of soy ; the 
water will waste away, leaving enough to make the 
gravy ; after taking out the meat, skim off all 
the fat you can before making the gravy ; dish 
the mutton ; stir a little flour into the gravy, give 

3 



34 RECEIPTS . 

it one boil, and then turn the vegetables and gravy 
over the meat. 

MUTTON CHOPS, 

If broiled on a gridiron, should be wrapped in 
paper ; they require about ten minutes to cook ; 
when they are taken out of the papers to be dished, 
season them with pepper, salt, and a little butter. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Lay the mutton chops into a pan, dredge a little 
flour over them, put them into the oven with the 
door half open ; they require about fifteen minutes 
to cook ; have prepared a hot dish ; after you dish 
the chops, dredge a little flour into your gravy, with 
a few spoonsful of hot water, tomato catsup, pepper, 
and salt ; give it one boil, and turn it over the chops. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Beat up an egg, and season the chops with pepper 
and salt : dip them in the egg, and then roll them in 
bread crumbs ; put them into a pan, and set them in 
the oven : cook them about fifteen minutes ; after 
dishing the chops, add to your gravy a little butter, 
red wine, and currant jelly ; dredge in a little flour ; 
let it boil once, and turn it over the chops. 

A FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

The bone should be taken out ; fill the cavity 
with a dressing made of bread crumbs, pepper, salt, 
and sweet marjoram, a piece of butter the size of 



MEATS. 35 

an egg, or a little fat pork chopped very fine, and 
one egg ; mix this up well ; skewer the veal tight 
to keep the dressing in. It adds to the look and 
taste of a fillet of veal to lard it with pork ; if this 
is not done, it should be basted often with butter. 
A piece weighing eight pounds requires four hours 
to roast. 

A LOIN OF VEAL 

Is very nice, roasted plain ; it is, however, very 
palatable cooked the same as a fillet of veal, by 
taking out the kidneys, and putting dressing in 
their place. It requires three hours if roasted plain, 
and three and a half hours with dressing. 

A BREAST OF VEAL, BOASTED, 

Requires an hour and a half to roast ; a few 
strips of pork laid across it makes it much nicer. 

BOILED VEAL. 

A fillet or shoulder of veal is very nice boiled ; 
prepared the same as to roast. Boil three hours, 
and serve with celery or oyster sauce. 

TO RAGOUT A BREAST OF VEAL. 

Lay a breast of veal in a pan with a pint of 
water, a little salt, pepper, and mace ; to stew an 
hour and a half, and turn it once or twice ; make 
some force-meat balls, with a little veal chopped 
fine, a few bread crumbs, sweet herbs, salt, pepper, 
a little butter, and one egg ; mix it well together, 
and make it into small balls, and lay them on the 



36 RECEIPTS. 

meat ; baste it with butter, dredge on a little flour, 
set it into the oven to brown about twenty min- 
utes, and dish the veal ; add to the gravy a glass 
of white wine, a little butter, and a little flour ; 
give it one boil, and pour the gravy over the meat. 

A RAGOUT VEAL WITH VEGETABLES. 

Cut in small dice-form one carrot and one turnip, 
chop one onion fine, and put them into a pan with 
a quart of water, a little pepper, salt, and mace. 
Put in the veal ; set it into the oven ; turn the 
meat once or twice ; stew it two hours ; take it 
out, dredge on some flour, and baste it with the 
gravy. Set it into the oven again to brown. When 
done, dish the meat, stir into the gravy a little flour, 
a little soy or tomato catsup, give it one boil, and 
turn it over the meat. 

A VEAL PIE. 

A rack of veal cut into small pieces, parboil in 
water enough to fill your pie dish ; when about 
half cooked, take the veal out to cool, season the 
gravy with pepper, salt, a little mace, and a little 
salt pork ; dredge in a little flour, line the sides of 
your dish with paste, lay in your meat and gravy, 
cover it with a thick paste, and cut a little hole in 
the top. Bake it half an hour. 

A VEAL POT PIE. 

Take a scrag or breast neck of veal, cut it into 
slices about an inch thick, fry some slices of salt 
pork in an iron pot ; flour the veal, lay them into 



MEATS. 37 

the hot fat and let it brown a little ; add water 
enough to just cover the meat, let it simmer about 
half an hour ; season it with pepper and salt, dredge 
in a little flour ; have ready a common paste, roll 
it about a half an inch thick, just large enough to 
cover the meat ; cover the pot with a hot iron 
cover, let it cook gently about three quarters of an 
hour. 

VEAL CUTLET. 

Fry half a dozen slices of salt pork a nice brown 
color ; take out the pork and keep it hot ; and add 
a few spoonsful of cook fat. A slice from the leg 
of veal makes the best cutlet. Wash and wipe 
the slices very dry ; have ready an egg beaten, and 
some bread crumbs; dip the cutlet first into the 
egg, and then into the crumbs ; lay them into the 
hot fat; fry about fifteen or twenty minutes, or 
until they are of a nice brown. Dish the cutlets. 
Make your gravy by adding a little hot water and 
butter ; dredge in a little flour and soy, and give it 
one boil, stirring it all the time ; turn it over the 
cutlets, garnished with scraped horseradish and the 
salt pork. 

VEAL CROQUETES. 

Mince the veal very fine, and season it with a 
little pepper, salt, and mace ; with the hands make 
it into balls the form of a pear, roll them in egg, 
and then in crumbs. Fry them in hot fat, and 
dish them on the large end ; place a stalk of pars- 
ley in the small end ; garnish with parsley. 



38 RECEIPTS. 

MINCE VEAL. 

Take cold roast or boiled veal, and chop it very 
fine ; season it with pepper and salt. If you have 
any cold gravy, put it with it ; if not. butter will 
answer. Heat it very hot, stirring it often, that the 
gravy may not oil ; serve it on slices of toasted 
bread, and garnish with lemon. 

A CALF'S HEAD. 

Soak a calf's head in cold \V;II<T two hours, take 
out the brains, scrape the hend very clean, flour a 
cloth, pin up the head very tight, and put it into six 
or eight quarts of water to boil with two pounds of 
salt pork. Tie up the brains in a piece of cloth 
separately. Let the head boil about two hours, 
then add the liver, lights, and brains, and let it all 
boil two hours more. Remove the cloth, and the 
large bones will come out very easily from the 
head ; lay it on a disli with the skin side up ; this 
is to be kept hot while making the gravy ; then 
take a quart of the liquor that the head was boiled 
in, one third of the liver chopped very fine, the 
brains braided up with a spoon, a quarter of a 
pound of butter, two table-spoonsful of flour, pep- 
per, salt, and sweet marjoram. Put this together 
into a saucepan and let if boil ; then add two table- 
spoonsful of vinegar ; divide the liver and head, 
skin the tongue, and lay it on around the head on 
the dish ; put a part of the gravy over the head, 
and send the remainder to table in a gravy dish. 
Garnish your dish with scraped horseradish and 
lemon sliced. 



MEATS. 39 

i 

TO STEW A CALF'S HEAD. 

Boil the head, so that the large bones can be 
taken out with ease, but not enough for eating ; 
put some butter into a stewpan or baking kettle ; 
when the butter is melted, put the jelly part of the 
head down with it, so as to brown it. handsomely. 
Move it a little while cooking, lest it should stick 
to the bottom. Then turn over the head, dredge 
flour around the kettle enough to thicken the gravy, 
and let it brown a little ; take about a quart of the 
liquor in which the head was boiled, and pour it 
on the head in the kettle ; put in half a tumbler of 
wine, red and white mixed together, a little sweet 
marjoram, some grated nutmeg, a little mace, a 
clove or two pounded, a little cayenne, and a little 
black pepper and salt to your taste. With all these 
condiments season the gravy ; then slice some of 
the liver and tongue which has been previously 
parboiled ; stew all an hour or more, watching it 
constantly lest it stew too much. Garnish with 
egg balls, force-meat balls, and sliced lemon. The 
brains should be taken out and boiled separately 
from the head, and added just before serving it 
all up. 

CALF'S FEET. 

Boil about three hours in four quarts of water ; 
then take out the large bones, split the feet, and lay 
them into a saucepan ; shake in a little flour, two 
ounces of butter, a little pepper, salt, mace, half a 
teacup of white wine, a table-spoonful of vinegar, 



40 RECEIPTS. 

and two teacups of the liquor in which the feet 
were boiled. Simmer this all together about ten 
minutes, and send it to the table very hot, garnished 
with sliced lemon. 

The remainder of the liquor in which the feet 
were boiled may be used for jelly, as directed for 
calf's foot jelly. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER. 

Lard it with fat pork. ;md put it into an iron pan 
with a pint of water or veal stock. Bake it three 
quarters of an hour, basting it frequently. Have 
prepared some macaroni, well boiled in milk and 
water. Dish the liver, lay around the macaroni, 
add to the gravy a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, a little flour, pepper, salt, and soy. Boil it up 
once, and turn it over the dish. 

SWEET I'.KEADS. 

Lard them with salt pork, and boil them in clear 
water about fifteen minutes ; put them into cold 
water about ten minutes, then put them into a pan. 
Dredge in a little flour, about half a pint of hot 
water, very little mace, pepper, and salt ; set them 
into the oven to brown about, twenty minutes. 
Dish the sweet breads, add to the gravy a piece of 
butter about the size of an egg, and a little flour ; 
give it one boil, and turn it over the sweet breads hot. 
Garnish the dish with sliced lemon and parsley. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

Yeal olives are made in the same manner as beef 
olives. 



MEATS. 41 

ROAST LAMB. 

The fore quarter is much the best piece to roast. 
It should be roasted about one hour and a half, and 
frequently basted. To make the gravy, take all 
the dripping from the tin roaster, add a very little 
water, a little salt and flour, and give it one boil. 

MINT SAUCE, 

To serve with roast lamb. Take a bunch of green 
mint, and chop it very fine with a knife ; add a tea- 
cup of fine brown sugar, and a teacup of sharp 
vinegar. Stir this up, and send it to the table in 
a sauce-boat. 

A BOILED LEG OF LAMB. 

A common-sized one should be boiled about an 
hour and a half; drawn butter and parsley to be 
served with it. 

LAMB CUTLETS AND CHOPS. 

Dressed in the same manner as mutton chops. 
(See page 33.) 

ROAST VENISON. 

A leg of venison weighing fourteen pounds 
should be roasted one hour if eaten on blazers ; if 
on hot plates, two hours. The dry skin should be 
taken off with the fingers, not with a knife. The 
spit should be turned very often. When half done, 
it should be basted with flour, butter, and red wine 
very frequently, until done. To make the gravy, 
take the shank of the venison, crack the bone, a 



42 RECEIPTS. 

pound of juicy beef, an onion stuck full of cloves, 
a little pepper and salt. Put it into a saucepan 
with two quarts of water, and boil it gently three 
hours. Strain this, and add to it the drippings from 
the venison, with nearly a cmarter of a pound of 
butter ; braid in two table-spoonsful of flour, a tea- 
cup of red wine, and a teacup of currant jelly. 
Stir it all up, and let it boil about five minutes. 

A SADDLE OF VEXISOX. 

A saddle of venison is much the best piece of 
the deer. It requires but half the time to roast 
this as it does the leg, for it is a much thinner 
piece. Dressed in the same manner as the leg. 



A VEXISON STEAK. 

Cut steaks from the leg half an inch thick, broil 
them about five minutes ; season with pepper, salt, 
and butter. If you have it, a cup of the roast 
venison gravy very hot is very nice poured over it ; 
or half a cup of red- wine, and half a cup of cur- 
rant jelly, thickened with a little flour and butter, 
boiled up and turned over the steak. It should be 
served very hot. 

VEXISON PIE. 

Take the breast and neck of venison, and cut it 
into small pieces. Season with pepper, salt, and a 
little ground cloves, and dredge it well with flour ; 
put it into the pie dish as close as possible, fill up 
the dish with some of the roast venison gravy, or 



MEATS. 43 

gravy prepared in the same manner, and cover the 
dish with a nice crust. Bake it half an hour. 

ROAST PIG. 

Make a dressing of bread crumbs, a little salt, 
pepper, sage, sweet marjoram, an onion chopped 
fine, butter, two eggs, and a little salt pork, and fry 
this a little ; when cold, stuff the pig, sew it up, 
and then wash it in salt and water ; baste it often. 
A pig weighing nine pounds requires four hours to 
roast it. 

A SPARE-RIB OR CHINE OF PORK 

Is much nicer if rubbed over, before it is roasted, 
with a little pepper, salt, and fine sage. Take all 
the fat out of the roaster when about half done, 
and then with the dripping make the gravy. 

FRIED PORK STEAKS. 

Fry a few slices of salt pork, take them out of 
the frying pan, dredge a little flour over the steaks, 
and a little pepper and salt ; fry them fifteen or 
twenty minutes slowly. Slices of apple fried in 
the fat are very nice to eat with the pork. 

FRIED PIGS' FEET. 

Make a batter with a little flour, water, a little 
salt, and one egg. Dip the feet in to cover them. 
Have your fat hot, and fry them until quite brown. 
Make a little drawn butter, and add a spoonful of 
vinegar to serve with them.

PIG'S HEAD CHEESE. 

Boil a pig's head until the bone comes out, and 
chop this very fine ; pound about eight soft crackers 
very fine, and mix this up well ; add some sweet 
herbs, pepper, salt, and spices. Put this into a 
mould, and press it for two or three days. It is 
very nice cut into thin slices, and eaten cold. 

ROAST HAM. 

Spit a ham ; set it before a moderate fire to 
roast about two hours, turning the spit frequently ; 
then take it up on to a dish, peal off the rind, 
scrape all the fat out of the roaster, put it to the 
fire to roast again about two hours more ; basting 
it frequently in the same way as for beef. To 
make the gravy, put the dripping from the roaster 
into a saucepan, add a cup of water, a little flour, 
and give it one boil. Served in a sauce-tureen. 

A roasted ham is far superior to a boiled one. 

BOILED HAM. 

A ham should be put into cold water enough to 
more than cover it, and boiled gently. A ham 
weighing fifteen pounds requires f^e hours' boil- 
ing. When about half done, and a part of the 
water has boiled away, add, if approved, a bottle 
of champagne, or a pint of good white wine vine- 
gar ; cover the pot close, to keep the flavor of the 

wine. 

An old ham should be laid in cold water over 

night.

BOILED LEG CORNED PORK. 

One weighing ten pounds should be put into 
cold water ; boiled three hours after it begins to 
boil. 



POULTRY. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

A TURKEY should be well singed and cleaned of pin- 
feathers ; then draw the inwards. Be sure you take 
every thing out that is inside. Lay the turkey into 
cold water, clean the gizzards, liver, heart, and neck, 
let all soak one hour if you have time. Wash all very 
clean, wipe the turkey very dry, inside and out. 
Make a dressing of two cups of bread crumbs, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two large spoonsful of sweet 
marjoram, two spoonsful of butter, one egg, and mix 
them well together. Cut the skin of the turkey in 
the back part of the neck, that the breast may look 
plump ; fill the breast with the force-meat, and sew 
it up. If you have any more force-meat than is 
required for the breast, put the remainder into the 
body, and skewer the vent ; tie the legs down very 
tight, skewer the wings down to the sides, and turn 
the neck on to the back with a strong skewer. Baste 
with salt and water once, then frequently with but- 
ter ; fifteen minutes before dishing, dredge with a 



46 RECEIPTS. 

little salt and flour, and baste with butter for the 
last time. This will give a fine frothy appearance, 
and add to the flavor of the turkey. 

To make the gravy, put the gizzard, neck, and 
liver into a saucepan with a quart of water, a 
little pepper, salt, and mace ; put it on the fire, 
and let it boil to about a half pint. When done, 
braid up the liver very fine with a knife, put it back 
into the water it has boiled in ; then add the drip- 
pings of the turkey and a little flour, and give it one 
boil, stirring it all the time. Dish the gizzard with 
the turkey. Allow twelve minutes to a pound for 
the time to roast a turkey. 

A turkey weighing ten pounds requires two hours 
to roast with a clear fire, not too hot. Turn the 
spit very often. 

BOILED TURKEY 

Is dressed the same as for roasting, except in the 
dressing. Put in the pork chopped very fine, instead 
of butter. In trussini turn the wings on the back, 
instead of the sides, as for roasting ; flour a cloth 
well, pin up the turkey tight, put it into boiling 
water where one or two pounds of salt pork have 
been boiling some time ; let this boil with the tur- 
key. Dish the pork with the turkey on a separate 
dish with some parsley. Serve with oyster sauce. 

A turkey weighing eight pounds requires an hour 
and a half to boil. 

ROAST CHICKENS. 

Dress and roast the same as a turkey. A pair of 



POULTRY. 47 

chickens weighing six pounds requires an hour and 
a half to roast. Make the gravy the same as for a 
turkey, except the mace, which is to be omitted. 

BOILED CHICKENS. 

Dressed and boiled the same as a turkey. Some 
cooks do not stuff boiled chickens or turkeys ; but 
the dressing adds as much to the boiled as to the 
roast. Pork boiled with chickens is very neces- 
sary. A pair of chickens requires from one to two 
hours to boil, depending upon the size and age. 

TO BONE, AND COOK A BONED TURKEY. 

Clean the turkey well, lay it on the table, have a 
small, sharp-pointed knife ; begin at the wing, pass 
the knife close to the bone, cut the flesh from the 
bone, and keep the skin as whole as possible ; then 
pass the knife on each side of the breast, and then 
around the legs ; split the back about half way up, 
and draw out the bones. Have ready a stuffing 
made of the meat of a chicken chopped very fine, 
bread crumbs, pepper, salt, mace, sweet marjoram, a 
piece of butter, and two eggs, all well mixed up. 
Fill the turkey and sew it up, preserving tht form. 
Have two calves' feet cracked up well, and the bones 
that have been taken out of the turkey put into a 
deep saucepan with one onion and one carrot cut 
very fine, mace, pepper, salt, and a few cloves. Lay 
the turkey on the bones, and add two quarts of 
water ; cover it tight, and let it simmer three hours, 
then take out the turkey, flour it and baste it well 



48 KECEIPTS. 

with butter, and set it in the oven to brown. If there 
is not one quart of gravy, add more water, and let it 
boil half an hour. Beat up the whites and shells of 
two eggs, and stir into the gravy, and let it boil 
fifteen minutes ; strain it through a cloth into a jelly 
mould. When the turkey is cold and the jelly is 
hard, dish the turkey with the jelly on the breast. 
This is considered a very nice supper dish. 

HASH TU1IKKY OR CHICKENS. 

Cut the meat from the bone, take off the skin, cut 
the meat into small pieces, put them into a sauce- 
pan with a little pepper, salt, and if you have it, a 
little cold gravy ; if not, put in a little butter and 
a cup of hot water. Dredge in a little flour, cover 
it very tight, and simmer it ten or fifteen minutes. 
Stir it frequently to prevent from frying. 

CHICKEN' PIE. 

Cut the chicken into four quarters. Season them 
with pepper, salt, a little mace and sweet marjo- 
ram. Lay the chicken into the dish very close, 
dredge in some flour, a little butter in small bits, 
and a cupful of hot water (or veal stock) enough 
to fill the dish. Make a good paste crust, line the 
sides of the dish and rim, put in the chicken, cover 
it over with the crust, cut a hole in the top, and 
bake it half an hour. If the chickens are not very 
young, they should be boiled half an hour after 
they are cut up, with some strips of pork.

EAST INDIAN CURRY. 

Skin a chicken, cut it in small pieces, take two 
table-spoonsful of flour, and one of curry powder ; 
stir them together dry, dip the chicken into it, and 
fry it a fine light brown. It may be fried in pork 
or butter j put it into a pot and pour over it boiling 
water enough to cover it ; let it boil slowly until 
tender. Mix the remainder of the flour, and curry 
with a little water, and put into the pot, and boil it 
a few minutes more ; salt to the taste. 

To be eaten with rice boiled tender, but dry ; it 
must look like a snowball. 

WHOLE CHICKENS CURRIED. 

Put the chickens whole into a saucepan, with a 
little pepper, salt, and a few pieces of pork ; cover 
them with cold water. When about half done, add 
a cup of rice and a little more water if required. 
Let it boil until the chicken is quite tender, then 
put the chicken on a dish, and mix with the gravy 
a large spoonful of curry, stir it in well, and turn 
it over the chicken. 

CURRY CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into good shaped pieces, put it 
into a saucepan with a few little pieces of salt pork, 
an onion, and a little salt. Put in cold water enough 
to cover it ; let it simmer over the fire until the 
chicken is very tender, and the water has simmered 
almost away ; then mix a table-spoonful of curry 
in a little water, stir this with the gravy, and let it

50 RECEIPTS. 

stew with the chicken ten minutes. Have ready 
some rice boiled and formed in cups. Dish the 
chicken, take out the onion, turn the gravy over 
the chicken, and lay the rice around the dish. 

FRICASSEE OF CHICKENS. 

Cut the chicken into good-shaped pieces, wash 
and dry them well ; put into a deep frying-pan half 
a pound of butter, and put it over the fire until it 
melts. While it is quite hot, lay the chicken in to 
fry a little on both sides, then turn in a cup of boil- 
ing water, with a little flour, salt, and pepper, cover 
it up tightly, and let it simmer over a slow fire ten 
or fifteen minutes. 

BROILED CHICKENS. 

Chickens to broil should be very young and small. 
Split them through the back, and skewer the legs 
and wings down firmly. Broil them twenty minutes 
slowly, and season them with salt and pepper, and 
plenty of butter. Send them to the table very hot. 

PILAFF. (A FAMOUS TURKISH DISH.) 

Take five cupsful of good beef stock, season it 
very well with pepper, salt, and a plenty of toma- 
toes ; add to it three cups of rice, set it on a mode- 
rate fire, and simmer it until the rice has absorbed 
the soup. Cut up a chicken, season it with pepper 
and salt, and fry it nicely in butter. Make a hole 
in the rice, put in the chicken, and cover it up in 
the rice. Melt half a pound of butter, do not let 
it oil, and turn it over the rice. Let it stand where 






POULTRY. 51 

it will keep hot about fifteen minutes, until the rice 
absorbs the butter, then turn it on the dish, but do 
not stir it up. Serve it very hot. 

KOAST GOOSE. 

Take a common goose, clean it well, and wash it 
the same as turkey. Make a dressing of six or eight 
potatoes well boiled and mashed, two onions 
chopped very fine, two teaspoonsful of sage, one 
of salt, and one of pepper. Put it into the body of 
the goose, and sew it up. Roast it two hours : 
baste it in its own drippings. When about half done, 
turn off the fat from the roaster. The last drippings 
are sufficient for the gravy ; boil the liver, &c. as for 
turkey. The gravy is made the same as for a turkey. 

A MOUNTAIN GOOSE. 

Cleanse it the same as the turkey. Make a 
dressing of bread crumbs, one onion chopped very 
fine, two spoonsful of sage, pepper, salt, and a little 
pork chopped fine, and one egg. To roast a large 
goose, requires two hours' cooking. The gravy is 
made the same as for common goose. 

A MONGREL GOOSE 

Is dressed the same as the common goose, but as 
the mongrel has so much flavor, the dressing is 
unnecessary. Without dressing, an hour and a half 
will roast a large-sized goose. 

WILD GOOSE. 
A wild goose should be roasted rare ; one hour's 



52 EECEIPTS. 

roasting is sufficient. Add a glass of red wine, and 
half a cup of currant jelly to the gravy, which is 
made the same as for the common goose. Boil it 
together, and send it to the table in a sauce-tureen. 

ROAST DUCKS 

Are dressed in the same way as geese. A large 
pair of tame ducks require one hour to roast, black 
ducks half an hour, and canvas-back twenty-five 
in mutes. The gravy made the same as for goose. 

\\ ild ducks should be roasted after the soup is 
sent to the table. 

PRKl'AKIXt; AND COOKIXG SMALL BIRDS. 

Some cooks do not take out the entrails of small 
birds ; but the flavor is much nicer to draw all out. 
excepting the heart and liver. This may be done 
by making a small opening in the vent, and draw- 
ing very carefully. Wild birds should not lay in 
cold water to soak, but should be washed quickly 
and wiped dry. 

ROAST PARTRIDGES. 

Lard them well witli fat pork ; tie the legs down 
to the rump, leaving the feet on ; while cooking, 
baste them well with butter. They require twenty- 
five or thirty minutes to cook. To make the gravy, 
put the drippings into a saucepan with a piece of 
butter about the size of an egg, and a little flour and 
hot water. Let it boil up once. 

For the bread sauce, see page 59. 






POULTRY. 53 

TO BOIL PARTRIDGES. 

Cut off the feet, and tie down the legs very close- 
ly ; boil them with a piece of pork twenty minutes. 
Serve them with parsley and butter, or bread-sauce. 

The pork should boil one hour before the par- 
tridges are put into the pot. 

TO BROIL PARTRIDGES. 

Split them through the back, broil them fifteen 
minutes ; dish them with pepper, salt, and a little 
butter. A piece of salt pork broiled to eat with 
them is a very great improvement. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 

Pigeons may be roasted with or without stuffing. 
If they are stuffed, the dressing should be made 
(for one dozen pigeons) with two cups of stale 
bread crumbs, two spoonsful of sweet marjoram, 
one of pepper, two of salt, one of ground cloves, 
one onion chopped fine, a little salt pork chopped, 
and one or two eggs. Mix this up well with the 
hands, stuff the bodies, sew them up, and truss 
them very tightly. Roast them half an hour, baste 
them with butter, and a strip of salt pork pinned 
on to the breast with a small needle. For the 
gravy, take the drippings, a cup of meat stock, a 
piece of butter with a little flour ; put in half a 
glass of red wine, and half a teaspoonful of cloves. 
Give it one boil. 

POTTED PIGEONS. 

Prepare them by the directions given for roast- 



54 KECEIPTS. 

ing ; lay five or six slices of salt pork in the bot- 
tom of the pot ; chop an onion very fine, and fry 
it in the fat to a nice brown ; then put the pigeons 
into the pot quite close, with a little pepper and 
salt, and shake in a little flour ; turn in hot water, 
or brown stock enough to quite cover over the 
pigeons, and stew them gently one hour ; if the 
water boils away, add a little more. Split six 
crackers, dip them in cold water, cover the pigeons 
over with them, and stew them fifteen minutes 
longer. Dish them in a deep dish, and turn the 
gravy over them. 

PIGEOX PIE. 

Cut the pigeons in halves, put them into a sauce- 
pan with meat stock enough to cover them, a little 
pepper, salt, and cloves, and cut up two tomatoes 
and put in. Stew them from half an hour to an 
hour, according to size and age. Line the sides of 
your pie dish witli paste, lay the pigeons into the 
dish, and fill it up with the gravy. Shake in a 
little flour to thicken it, and put in a piece of but- 
ter if it is not rich enough. Cover it with a nice 
crust, and bake it about three quarters of an hour, 
until the crust is done. 

QUAILS. 

Tie the legs down to the rump with a strong 
thread, letting the feet be up. Dredge them with 
a little flour, baste them with butter, and roast 
them fifteen or twenty minutes. 



POULTRY. 55 

QUAIL PIE. 

Stew them in veal stock about ten minutes, take 
them out, thicken the gravy with a little flour and 
a small piece of butter ; add a little pepper and 
salt ; fill up the dish with gravy, and cover it with 
a nice paste. Bake it half an hour. 

WOODCOCK. 

Woodcock should be trussed with the bills run- 
ning through the legs and wings. Roast them the 
same as quails. Make the gravy of a little drawn 
butter, two spoonsful of red wine, and two of cur- 
rant jelly, boiled up. 

PLOVER. 

Plover require about ten or fifteen minutes' 
roasting. Serve on toasted bread. The gravy is 
made the same as for quails. 

SNIPE OR PEEP PIE. 

Flour the birds, season them with pepper, salt, 
and a little clove ; lay them into a pie dish. Make 
a gravy with beef stock well seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and tomato catsup, with a piece of butter and 
a little flour. Fill up the dish with the gravy ; 
line the sides of the dish, and cover it with a rich 
paste crust, and bake it half an hour. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

Boil chickens, turkey, or veal, remove all the 
skin and gristle, and chop it very fine. Cut heads 
of lettuce into quarters, and lay it into water with 
a piece of ice. If made with celery, it should be 



56 RECEIPTS. 

slivered very fine, and laid into water with ice to 
crisp. Make the dressing by taking the yolks of 
two or three eggs, a table-spoonful of mixed mus- 
tard, a little cayenne pepper and salt, and stir this 
together with a large fork, on a flat dish ; turn in 
gently, stirring all the time one way, half a bottle 
of sweet oil ; add a little vinegar ; turn in a little 
more oil, stirring it up well. Put about half of the 
dressing with the meat, mix it up with a spoon, 
add a little more vinegar, put it into the centre of 
a flat dish, cut the lettuce in quarters, dry the let- 
tuce in a napkin, and lay it neatly around the meat ; 
turn the remainder of the dressing over the lettuce. 
It may be served the same as the above, or cut the 
celery very fine with a knife, but do not chop it. 
After it is cut, mix it well with the meat. Send 
it to table in a celery bowl. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

Is made the same way as chicken salad, only 

the lobster should be cut into small pieces, and not 
chopped. The row or coral of the lobster should 
be grated fine to garnish the dish.

rub it over with the yolk of an egg, and set it in 
the oven to brown. When it is done turn the hash 
into the middle of the dish. This makes a very 
handsome finish to a dish. 

Rice prepared in this way, spread over a pie 
made of cold meat, for the crust, an inch thick, 
and browned, is nice. 

POTATO CRUST OR EDGING. 

Boil one dozen good potatoes, and mash them 
well. Add a piece of butter, a little salt, and half 
a cup of cream or milk. Stir it well with a large 
spoon, and form it the same as the rice. It is even 
better for a crust than rice. 

POTATO EDGING FOR TONGUE. 

Prepare the potato as above. Put it around the 
dish in lumps with a large spoon, and stick into 
each lump a sprig of parsley. 

FOR VEAL, COOKED IN ANY WAY. 

Slices of lemon and grated horseradish, laid 
around the dish, or sent to the table in small dishes 
with the meat, is a great improvement in the ap-

SAUCES. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Take two quarts of oysters, wash them out of the 
liquor with the hands to get out all the grit, let the 
liquor stand and settle, then drain it into a saucepan, 
add a little mace, and set it to boil. Braid two 
spoonsful of flour into half a pound of butter ; stir 
this into the boiling liquor, and let it again boil up ; 
then put in the oysters and give it one boil. Serve 
it in an oyster dish. 

CELKHY PAITE. 

Take two or three heads of celery, cut it up fine, 
put it into a saucepan with about three pints of cold 
water, a little salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it 
two hours. Braid into a quarter of a pound of but-

BREAD SAUCE FOR PARTRIDGES. 

Cut up an onion, and boil it in milk until it is 
quite soft ; then strain the milk into a cup of stale 
bread crumbs, and let it stand one hour. Then 
put it into a saucepan with about two ounces of 
butter, a little pepper, salt, mace, and the boiled 
onion. Boil it all up together, and serve it in a 
sauce tureen. 

ANOTHER BREAD SAUCE. 

Take a large slice of stale bread boiled in milk 
and water, a little mace, pepper, and salt ; when 
about half done, add a piece of butter and a glass 
of white wine. Let it boil up once. 

FISH SAUCE. 

Take half a pint of milk and cream together, 
two eggs well beaten, salt, and a little pepper, and 
the juice of half a lemon. Put it over the fire, and 
stir it constantly until it begins to thicken. Serve 
it the same as drawn butter. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

Take out all the meat and the soft part from the 
body, cut it up very fine, and put it into a saucepan

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Take half a pound of butter, braid into it two 
table-spoonsful of flour, put it into a saucepan, and 
add one teacup of boiling water ; set it on the fire, 
stirring it all the time until it almost boils. If it is 
to be served with boiled mutton, add two table- 
spoonsful of capers ; if it is for boiled chicken, add 
two teaspoonsful of parsley, chopped fine ; if it is 
for boiled fish, add tAvo eggs boiled hard and chop- 
ped fine ; and if it is for fried fish, serve it plain. 



-: SAUCE. 

Peal, quarter, and core the apples, and throw 
them into cold water, rince them out, put them into 
a preserving kettle with a very little water, and 
cover them up tightly. Stew them until nearly 
done, then sprinkle in sugar enough to sweeten 
them to your taste. Cover it up tight again, and 
simmer them until done. Turn the kettle bottom 
upwards so as not to stir the apples and break 
them, as the sauce looks much better with the ap- 
ples whole as possible. 

The time of cooking apple sauce depends upon 
the kind of apples used. Greenings cook much 
quicker than other kinds, and are the best kind 
for cooking. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put a pint of water, and a quarter of a pound of 
sugar into a saucepan ; let it boil about ten minutes ; 
put in as many apples pealed, cored and quartered 



GARNISHING- FOR DISHES. 61 

as the syrup will cover when it boils up. Simmer 
until quite tender. The apples will be transparent, 
and if taken up carefully look very handsome. 

Apple sauce made in this way does not require 
any more sugar than when made in the common 
way ; it requires a little more care, and looks much 
handsomer. 

ANOTHER APPLE SAUCE. 

Put the apples k into an earthen crock, with a 
handful of sugar, a pint of cider and water, and 
cover it with a brown crust. Bake it in the oven 
three or four hours. If baked in a brick oven, let 
it remain all night. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Pick and wash the cranberries. Put them into 
the kettle or saucepan with a little water, and stew 
them about half an hour ; then stir them up, and 
add sugar enough to sweeten, stir it in, and cover 
it up tightly. Let it simmer fifteen minutes j take 
off the cover and let it simmer a little longer, and 
turn it into an earthen jar. 

ANOTHER CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Stew the cranberries forty minutes, strain them 
through a sieve, add sugar to your taste, and then 
give it one boil ; turn it into moulds.. To take it 
out of the moulds, put it into hot water about a 
minute ; then turn it out on a dish.

VEGETABLES. 

TO BOIL POTATOES. 

PEAL them, lay them into cold water two or 
three hours before you cook them ; put them into 
boiling water and boil them half an hour ; then 
drain off the water, sprinkle over them a little salt, 
give them a shake, put the covej* half on, and let 
them stand while dishing dinner ; take them up 
with a spoon. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Boil them as above directed, put them into an 
earthen pot, mash them very quickly with a potato 
masher, add a piece of butter, half a cup of cream, 
and a little salt. Beat this up very lightly with a 
spoon, put it in any form in tin plates, and rub them 
over with egg, and set them in the -oven ten or fif- 
teen minutes. 

FRICASSEE POTATOES. 

Take cold boiled potatoes, cut them into square 
pieces, put them into a saucepan with a little pep- 
per and salt, dredge in a little liour, a teacup of

hot, stirring the pan very often. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

Cut cold potatoes into slices, dredge on a little 



VEGETABLES. 63 

flour, pepper, and salt, put them into a pan where 
sausages have been fried, if you use potatoes that 
have not been cooked, cut them into thin slices, 
and pour boiling water over them ; let them stand 
while you fry a few slices of salt pork, wipe them 
dry, and fry as many at a time as will cover the 
bottom of the pan. 

All kinds of vegetables should be put into boil- 
ing water to cook. Every kind of vegetable, ex- 
cepting green peas, should lay in cold water some 
time before cooking them. 

TO BOIL PEAS. 

Peas should be well picked over, but not washed, 
as in washing them that little sweet stem that con- 
nects the pea to the pod is lost ; put them into boil- 
ing water, and boil them thirty minutes ; then drain 
them through a cullender, put them into a tin dish 
with a little butter and salt ; stir them and keep 
them hot while dishing the meat. As peas grow 
older, they should be boiled longer ; and when they 
are quite old, put a little saleratus into the water 
in wttich they are to be boiled. 

TO DRESS PEAS ANOTHER WAT. 

Put them into a saucepan, place it into another 
vessel of boiling water ; put in a small piece of but- 
ter, salt, pepper, parsley, the heart of lettuce, and a 
little summer savory. About twenty minutes before 
dishing, add another piece of butter, and dredge in 
some flour and stir it. For sauce, take one egg, juice

of a lemon, a very little salt, pepper, and a little 
milk ; stir it constantly until it thickens. After 
the peas are dished, pour the sauce over them. 

STRING BEANS 

Recjuire one hour to boil. They are dressed the 
same as peas. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Put a quart of white beans to soak in soft water, 
at night ; the next morning wash them out of that 
water ; put them into a pot with more water than 
will cover them ; set them over the fire to simmer 
until they are quite tender ; wash them out again 
and put them into an earthen pot, scald and gash 
one and a half pounds of pork, place it on top of the 
beans and into them, so as to have the rind of the 
pork even with the beans ; fill the pot with water, 
in which is mixed two table-spoonsful of molasses. 
Bake them five or six hours ; if baked in a brick 
oven it is well to have them stand in over nieht.

slices, or dress them the same as potato fricassees. 
or serve plain. 

BEETS. 

Boil them three or four hours ; be careful not to 
cut them before boiling, as all the color will boil 
out ; when they are boiled, lay them into cold 
water about five minutes, rub off the skin, and 
split them lengthwise. 

Beets are very nice to make a salad, if dressed 
the same as lettuce. 

TO BOIL RICE. 

Wash clean two cupsfut of rice, put it into a pot 
with two quarts of water, and boil it quite tender ; 
turn it into a cullender to drain, but do not stir it.

TO KEEP TOMATOES FOR WINTER. 

POUR boiling water on them, and let them stand 
one hour ; peel them, take out what seeds you can 
without breaking them too much, and season them 
with pepper and salt. Stew them about half an 
hour, put them into stone jars, cover them with a 
piece of paper, and try out some very nice beef tal- 
low. Strain it into the jars, put in a cork stopper 
while the fat is hot, that it may soak into the pores 
of the cork, and tie a bladder over it. This will 
keep a year. Put them in small jars, for after it is 
opened and exposed to the air it will not keep. 

When wanted for use, cook it the same as fresh 
tomatoes. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Take half a bushel of tomatoes, cut them in two, 
lay them in a dish, sprinkle a little salt over them, 
and let them stand three or four hours. Then drain

ing kettle with a pint of water ; let them stew two 
hours. Strain them through a cullender, put them 
back into the kettle, with half a teacup of salt, half 
an ounce of cayenne pepper, one ounce of cloves, 
one ounce of nutmeg, one of mace, and one quart 
of good white wine ; boil this one hour. When 
cold, bottle it and stop it tight.

DROPPED EGGS. 

Have ready a pan of boiling water, and break 
the eggs, holding it very close to the water. Drop 
in very slowly, that the yolk may not break. 
With a large spoon dip the boiling water over the 
yolk until the white forms a skim over it, and 
take out the egg with an egg slice, half a dozen

wipe out the pan, drain the fat into it, leaving the 
sediments ; add some good lard to it, and let it get 
boiling hot. Drop the eggs the same as above, and 
dish them around the ham. 

TO MAKE MILK TOAST. 

Put half a pound of butter into a tin toast-pan,

Dry toast should never be laid one slice upon 
another, but set on the edge to keep it dry. 

TO MAKE COFFEE. 

The coffee should be dried in the oven with the 
door open one or two hours before roasting. AVhen 
it is ready to roast, set it on the fire in an iron pan, 
and stir it constantly until it becomes a light 
brown. To two pounds of coffee add a bit of but- 
ter about the size of a walnut three minutes before 
taking it from the fire. Coffee is much better, 
when it is roasted, ground, and made within one 
hour. One cup of ground coffee will make one 
quart of coffee. To make coffee in a biggin, put 
the ground coffee into the filter, wet it with cold 
water, and let it stand five minutes to swell. Put 
the filter into the pot where it belongs ; fill it up 
with boiling water, and set it where it will keep 
hot, but not boil. When this has run through, add 
water until you have made a quart of coffee. It 
does not require more than ten minutes to make 
good coffee. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 73 

To boil coffee, put into a coffee-pot one cup of 
ground coffee, and stir in one egg, or a piece of 
salt-fish skin two inches square ; add one quart of 
water. Boil it ten minutes, take it off, turn a cup- 
ful out at the spout, and back again into the pot. 
Let it stand ten minutes. Turn it off into another 
pot to send to table.. Boiled cream or milk should 
always be served with coffee. 

TO MAKE TEA. 

Scald the teapot, put in the tea while the pot is 
hot, turn in just water enough to wet the tea, and 
let it stand about five minutes ; then fill up the 
teapot with boiling water. The quantity depends 
on taste.

RICH PUFF PASTE. 

To one pound of flour, allow one pound of but- 
ter. Wash the butter in cold water, divide it into 
three parts, make it into thin cakes, and lay them 
on the ice to harden. Sift the flour, take one cake 
of the butter and rub it well into the flour, mix it 
up lightly with the hands with cold ice water, 
sprinkle a little flour on the paste board, and roll 
the crust out very thin, rolling from you always. 
Be careful not to break the crust with the rolling 
pin. Roll out one cake of butter as thin as possi- 
ble, lay it on the paste, dredge on a little flour, roll 
up the paste, then roll it out thin again ; roll out 
the other cake of butter, lay it on the paste, dredge 
on a little more flour, and roll it up again. Cut it 
into as many pieces as required. For edging, roll 
out a piece as long as will go around the plate 
without piecing, as it looks much better. The 
edging should be three or four layers of paste rol- 
led very thin, and put on the rim of the plate. 
Use sifted flour to dredge on the paste board, and 
to roll the butter and paste together. This flour is 
included in the weight of the flour for the paste. 

COMMON PASTE. 

Take one pound of flour, and three quarters of 
a pound of -butter ; sift the flour on the paste 



PASTRY. 75 

board ; take two thirds of the butter, cut it with a 
knife into the flour, mix it up with just ice water 
enough to stick the flour and butter together, and 
roll it out about an inch thick ; put the rest of the 
butter on the paste, dredge on some flour, roll up 
the paste, flour the board and roll out the paste 
again smooth, and then roll it up again. 

This is a very good paste to line the plates with, 
and use the puff paste for the edging and upper 
crust. 

A VERY GOOD COMMON PASTE. 

To a pound of flour, take half a pound of but- 
ter and a quarter of a pound of lard, (this is best 
in winter,) or half butter and half lard, allowing a 
pound of flour to three quarters of a pound of 
shortening. Mix the lard and a little salt with the 
flour very lightly and quickly with ice water, flour 
the board, roll out the paste about a quarter of an 
inch thick ; put half the butter on with a knife in 
little bits, dredge on a plenty of flour, roll up the 
paste, then roll it out again, put the other half of 
the butter on the same as before, and again roll it 
up. This is a very nice crust for meat pie. 

APPLE PIE.

juicy, they make nice pies without stewing. Cut 
them thin, line a deep plate with crust, put in a 
layer of apple, some good brown sugar, a little 
mace or cinnamon, grated lemon peel, and a very 



76 RECEIPTS.

piece of butter about half the size of an egg, a 
little mace, the rind of a lemon grated, half a glass 
of wine, and sugar to the taste. Let it get quite 
cold, line flat tin plates with a good crust, fill 
them with the apple, and put on a rim and upper 
crust of puff paste. 

A VKllY NICE APPLE PIE, OR TART. 

Halve and core about ten good greening apples, 
put into a saucepan three cups of white sugar,

der and clear; take them out on a dish with a 
spoon, keeping them as whole as possible ; let the 
liquor boil away until there is only enough juice 
left for the pies, line the plates with crust, and lay 
in the apples carefully. Add a glass of wine to 
the juice, put a double edge of puff paste around

across the top add to the appearance of tarts. 
Bake them until the crust is done. 

GOOSEBERRY PIES OR TARTS. 

Pick off all the stocks and little blossoms, and 
make the pies the same as the rhubarb. For the 
tarts, the gooseberries should ,be strained through a 
coarse sieve. The seasoning should be put in 
while the fruit is hot, but the fruit should be per- 
fectly cold when put on the paste. 

MINCE PIE. 

Boil a beef tongue weighing six pounds, and 
what is called the vein of a round of beef weighing 
six pounds, six hours ; then skin the tongue, and

a cup each of salt, cinnamon, allspice and cloves, 
three nutmegs, and a table-spoonful of mace. Put 
this all into a large pan, mix it well together with 
the hands, and let it stand over night. What you 
wish to bake take into another pan, and add one 
half as much fine-chopped apples as you have meat. 
Mix it up well, and let it stand an hour. If it is not 
quite sweet enough, add as much sugar as required, 
and a little more wine. Put the remainder of the 
meat into a jar for future use, and turn on a little 
brandy. Cover it tight to keep the air from it. 
This not only keeps well, but is better than when 
it is first made. When more is required for use, the

until quite done. Just before sending them to the 
table, fill them with preserves of any kind. 

Paste looks much nicer if beat-up egg is brushed 
over it with a paste brush, and white sugar sifted on 
just before it is set into the oven. If it is to be very 
light colored, use only the white of the egg, and 



omit the sugar. 



LEMOX PIE. 



Grate the rind off two lemons, peal off the white 
skin, chop the lemon up fine, add two cups of sugar, 
beat up two eggs, and stir it all together. Roll out

will whip much sooner ; place the whip syringe 
quite to the bottom of the dish, and move it very 
quickly as the froth rises. Lay it on a sieve to 
drain. 

WHIPS IX GLASSES. 

Put a spoonful of jelly or jam in the bottom of 
jelly glasses, and fill the glasses with the whip 
made by the first direction. 

COLORED WHIPS. 

Add to the cream a few spoonsful of jelly or 
juice of any kind of fruit of the color you prefer. 

A VERY FIXE WHIP. 

A pound of sugar, half a pint of wine, the juice 
of four lemons, mix all together ; add a quart of 
rich cream, whip it to a strong froth, and serve in 
glasses. 

PIXEAPPLE WHIPS. 

Cut up the pineapple, sprinkle a little sugar over 
it, and let it stand over night ; strain it through a 
sieve, add as much sugar as will prevent the cream 



ICE CREAM. 107 

from turning when added to the juice. Add the 
cream, and whip it well. It is a very great addi- 
tion to place a layer of pineapple jam in the bot- 
tom of the dish. 

AN ORNAMENT FOR SWEET DISHES. 

Beat up to a strong froth the whites of eggs, sift 
on a very little fine sugar, and set it in the oven to 
brown a very little. This laid on the top of cus- 
tards of any kind is a great improvement to the 
appearance. 



ICE CREAM. 

MADE OF CREAM. 

To a gallon of cream allow two pounds of loaf 
sugar. Flavor it to the taste. The flavoring must ' 
be quite strong, as the freezing destroys it in part. 

MADE OF MILK. 

To a gallon of milk allow twenty eggs. Boil 
half the milk, beat up the eggs, turn the boiling 
milk into them, stirring them all the time, strain it, 
and then add the cold milk, the sugar, and the fla- 
voring. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Mix a little milk and four dessert-spoonsful of 
arrowroot; boil two quarts of milk, and stir the 



108 RECEIPT?. 

arrowroot into it ; then add two quarts of cold 
milk, the sugar, and flavoring. 

LEMON FLAVOR FOR ICES. 

Rub some lumps of sugar over the outside of 
three good lemons, until you extract the essence. 
Squeeze the juice, strain it, and add as much sugar 
as the juice will absorb. This will flavor one 
gallon of cream. 

PINEAPPLE FLAVOR. 

Take a common sized pineapple, cut it in slices, 
sprinkle some sugar over it. cover it up, and let it 
stand over night ; strain it, and add more sugar if 
necessary, for one gallon of cream. 

PEACH WATER FLAVOR. 

Take three table-spoonsful of the water to one 
gallon of cream. 

* 

RASII;I-:RRY FLAVOR. 

Add sugar to the raspberries, mash them, and 
strain the juice. A quart of raspberries will flavor 
a gallon of cream. 

STRAWBERRY FLAVOR. 

Made the same way as the Raspberry. 

V AXILLA FLAVOR. 

Simmer one bean in half a pint of milk until the 
flavor is extracted ; say two or three hours. 



ICE CREAM. 109 

WATER ICES. 

Take a gallon of ice water, sweeten it very sweet, 
and flavor it with any flavor that is agreeable to the 
taste. Freeze it the same as ice cream. 

ROMAN PUNCH. 

Make the punch with wine and brandy, sugar 
and lemon flavor, as for ice cream. It should be 
very strongly flavored, as in freezing it diminishes 
one half. 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING ICE CREAMS, WATER 

ICES, &C. 

Break the ice in small pieces, say about the size 
of an egg, or smaller, and put some in the bottom 
of a tub ; set the kettle in ; then put in about a 
quart of coarse rock salt j then two quarts of ice ; 
and so on until the tub is filled up to the top of 
the kettle. Stir it until the cream is frozen. In 
the old-fashioned freezer you must take off the 
cover frequently, and scrape off the cream from 
the sides until it freezes evenly. 

If it is to be put into moulds, fill them quite full, 
shut them very tight, and put them in the ice and 
salt, covering them entirely ; then throw over a 
piece of carpet to keep the air out. To take them 
out of the mould, have your dish ready, wipe the 
mould, and then turn over it some boiling water, 
wiping it again very quickly ; then turn it on the 
dish. Remove the mould very slowly, for fear of 



110 RECEIPTS. 

breaking. When pure essences can be procured, 
they are quite equal to fresh fruits to flavor with.

and core the quinces, weigh a pound of crushed 
sugar to a pound of quinces, put the peals and cores 



120 RECEIPTS. 

into a kettle with just water enough to cover them. 
Let this simmer about two hours, then strain the 
liquor, put it back into the kettle, and put in as 
many quinces as the liquor will cover, boil them 
until they are tender, take them out and put them 
on a flat dish to cool ; put in more until all are 
boiled, then put the sugar in, and let it boil until 
it becomes a syrup ; then put in as many quinces 
as the syrup will cover, let them boil about thirty 
minutes, put them on a flat dish to cool, and then 
more until they are all boiled ; then boil the syrup 
until all the water is boiled out of it. When the 
quinces are cool, put them into the jars, and strain 
the syrup while it is hot through a very fine sieve 
on to the quinces. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Prepare the quinces to boil as above directed, cut 
them into small pieces, boil them one hour, strain 
the liquor through a fine sieve ; measure a pint of 
liquor to a pound of sugar, boil it about twenty- 
five minutes, and strain it into the moulds. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Take the quinces that you have boiled for jelly, 
mash them with a spoon. To a pound of quinces 
take a pound of sugar, boil them together until 
they are well softened, then strain through a coarse 
sieve and put it up in small jars. 

PEACHES. 

Weigh to a pound of peaches a pound of sugar. 



PRESERVES. 121 

put the peaches into a preserving kettle, and turn 
on boiling water enough to just cover them, and 
let them boil ten minutes. Take them out care- 
fully on a flat dish to cool, then peal them with 
your fingers, to keep the shape ; take a little of the 
water that they were boiled in, add the sugar, and 
let it boil until it becomes a syrup. Put in a few 
peaches at a time so as not to crowd them ; when 
they are done put them on a dish to cool. Lay 
them carefully into a jar, boil the syrup a few min- 
utes ,after the peaches are done, and strain it hot 
over the peaches. 

ANOTHER MODE. 

Peel the peaches, weigh a pound of sugar to a 
pound of peaches, stew half the sugar on to the 
peaches, and let them stand over night. Next day 
turn off the syrup and add the rest of the sugar 
boil the syrup about fifteen minutes, put in the 
peaches and boil them until they are tender, take 
them out to cool, then put them up in jars and 
strain the syrup hot into them ; let them stand two 
or three days. If the syrup has become thin at 
the top of the jar, turn the peaches and syrup into 
the preserving kettle, give them one boil, and put 
them into the jars when cold. Put paper wet with 
brandy over the mouth of the jars, and then a 
bladder over that, and tie them up. 

BRANDY PEACHES. 

Prepare them as before directed, excepting the 



122 RECEIPTS. 

sugar ; take three quarters of a pound of sugar to 
one pound of peaches. When they are done, allow 
a quart of white brandy to a quart of syrup ; lay 
the peaches while they are hot into the cold brandy, 
then when they are cold put them into the jar ; 
strain the syrup hot through a fine sieve into the 
brandy, and then put it on the peaches. 

PLUMS. 

Green Gages. Take a pound of sugar to a 
pound of plums ; make a syrup of the sugar, with 
a little water, just enough to keep the sugar from 
burning ; put in a few plums at a time, boil them 
until they are tender, and take them out on a dish 
to cool. When all are done, put them into jars, 
then boil the syrup about ten minutes, and strain 
it on the plums. Let them stand three, or four 
days ; if the syrup then appears watery on the top, 
boil them over again about twenty minutes. 

EGG PLUMS. 

Pierce the skins of the plums with a large nee- 
dle. Take a pound of sugar to a pound of plums ; 
boil the sugar to a syrup, and put the plums in 
while it is hot ; boil them until the plums look 
clear ; take them out to cool, and so on until all 
are done. Put them up for three or four days, as 
above stated, &c. &c. 

DAMSON OR ANY DARK PLUM. 

Take a pound of sugar to a pound of plums. 



PRESERVES. 123 

Make the syrup, put in the plums, and boil them 
about thirty minutes. Let them cool. Then put 
them into jars, and strain the syrup on while it is 
boiling hot. 

CRAB APPLE. 

Leave the stem on. Weigh a pound of sugar to 
a pound of the fruit. Pierce the apples with a 
large needle. Make a syrup of the sugar ; when 
clear, put in the apples, and boil them thirty or forty 
minutes. Take them out very carefully, and lay 
them singly on a dish to cool ; when cold, put 
them into the jars, and strain the hot syrup over 
them. 

CRAB APPLE JELLY. 

Put the apples in the kettle, just cover them 
with water, and let them boil until they are very 
tender. Mash them with a spoon and strain out 
the juice. Take a pint of juice to a pound of 
sugar, boil it thirty minutes^ and strain it through 
a hair sieve. 

CRAB APPLE MARMALADE. 

Put the apples into the kettle, with just water 
enough to cover them, and let them boil until they 
are very soft ; mash them up, and strain them 
through a very coarse sieve. 'Take a pound of 
apple to a pound of sugar, boil it half an hour, and 
then put it into jars. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Take a dozen good tart apples, cut them into 



124 RECEIPTS. 

quarters, add a pint of water, and let them simmer 
about half an hour. Set a sieve over an earthen 
pan, turn the apples into it, and let them drain ; but 
do not stir the apples after the juice is drained out. 
Let it stand and settle about half an hour ; then 
take a pint of juice to a pound of white sugar, boil 
it ten minutes, and strain it into moulds or jars. 

The apple can be seasoned and used for apple 
sauce. 

APPLE MARMALADE 

Is made the same as the crab apple, except that 
the apples must be peeled. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Take a pound of fruit to a pound of sugar ; put 
them together into the kettle, and boil it gently 
one hour, stirring it frequently. Put it up in jars, 
and let it stand about four days ; if in that time 
the syrup rise at the top, put it in the kettle, and 
boil it half an hour. 

RASPBERRY OR BLACKBERRY JELLY. 

Stew the fruit, strain it through a sieve, measure 
a pint of juice to a pound of sugar, boil it twenty 
or thirty minutes, and then strain it through a very 
fine sieve into the jar while it is hot. Let them 
stand two or three days ; then do them up in the 
same manner as currant jelly. 



CURRANT JELLY. 

The currants should be ripe, and fresh picked. 



PRESERVES. 125 

Put them into a preserving kettle with a very little 
water, say about a cupful, to prevent them from 
burning. Let them stew gently until the currants 
turn white, then strain them through a sieve ; they 
will not require much squeezing. Take a pint of 
juice to a pound of sugar, put them into the kettle, 
and boil it thirty minutes. Take a spoonful out on 
a plate, and set the plate on ice ; if it is done, it will 
stiffen in five minutes. Then strain it through a 
very fine sieve into small glass jars. Set them in 
the sun two days. Put a piece of paper wet in 
brandy on the top, and over this a bladder, and tie 
them up. 

PINEAPPLE. 

Peel the pineapple, and cut it in slices about a 
quarter of an inch thick ; take a pound of sugar to 
a pound of fruit ; sprinkle the sugar over the apple, 
and let it stand until the next day. Then put it into 
the kettle, and boil it until the apple looks clear. 
Take out the apple to cool. Give the syrup one boil, 
and then strain it through a hair sieve on the fruit. 

PINEAPPLE JAM. 

Peel the apple and weigh it, a pound to a pound 
of sugar ; grate the apple on a coarse grater, put 
the apple and sugar in the kettle together, and let 
it boil thirty or forty minutes. 

STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit ; 
put the sugar into the kettle with just water enough 



126 KECEIPTS. 

to prevent its burning, boil to a syrup ; then put in 
as many strawberries at a time as will cover the top 
of the syrup without crowding them, and let them 
boil twenty minutes. Take them out carefully, so 
as not to break them, and put them in a dish to cool 
separately. When cold, put them into glass jars, and 
strain the hot syrup through a hair sieve on to them. 
The Hovey Seedlings are the best to preserve in 
this manner, as they are very large. If however 
they get broken, it would be better to put them back 
into the kettle and boil them thirty minutes for jam. 

ANOTHER WAY TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

Weigh a pound of fine loaf sugar to a pound of 
fruit, sprinkle the sugar over the fruit, and let it 
stand over night. The next day strain off the syrup 
and boil it about ten minutes ; then put in the fruit, 
and let it boil gently twenty minutes more. Skim 
out the fruit on a flat dish to cool. \Vhen cool, put 
them in jars, add the syrup, and tie them up tight, 
with paper dipped in brandy, and a bladder over it. 

CODDLED APPLES. 

Peel the apples, leaving the stems on, and put as 
many as will stand into the preserving kettle or 
saucepan ; put in a little water, and let them boil 
until they are tender. Take them out carefully. 
Allow a cup of sugar to three apples, put it into the 
water that they were boiled in, and boil it ten min- 
utes. Peal a lemon very thin in very narrow strips, 
lay them around the stem of the apple, put them 



PRESERVES. 127 

into the syrup, and boil them until they are clear. 
Put them into the dish in which you send them to 
the table, and pour the syrup on them. These will 
not keep more than three or four days. 

PEARS. 

Peel the pairs, boil them in water until they are 
quite tender, and then take them out on a dish to 
cool. Make a syrup of white sugar. A few pieces 
of ginger and a slice of lemon make a nice flavor to 
the syrup. Put in the pairs, and boil them gently 
until they are quite clear ; the time depends on the 
size ; if they are small, they require about thirty 
minutes. If to keep all winter, allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. 

STEWED PEARS. 

Take large honeyed pears, and peel, core and

MAKING PICKLES.

to a pail of water; boil the salt and water until the 
salt is dissolved, turn it boiling hot on the cucum- 
bers ; cover them up tight and let them stand 
twenty-four hours. Turn them into a basket to 
drain. Boil as much of the best cider vinegar as 
will cover the cucumbers, wash out the jars, put the 
cucumbers into them, turn on the vinegar boiling 
hot, cover them with cabbage leaves, and cover the 
jars tight. In forty-eight hours they will be fit for 
use. 

Any kind of pickles are good made in the same 
way.

seeds, fill them with very small onions, horseradish, 
mustard seed, cloves and peppercorns. Replace the 
piece taken out, tie them up tight, prepare them the 
same as cucumbers, only they should remain in the 
salt and water forty-eight hours instead of twenty- 
four. 



USEFUL HINTS. 133 

TO MAKE PICKLED CABBAGE. 

Take a red cabbage, cat it into thin slices, sprinkle 
over it a little salt, cover it with good sharp vinegar } 
let it stand two or three days. 



USEFUL HINTS. 

PIECES of stale bread should be kept clean and 
dry. Every two or three days put all the small 
pieces you have on a tin sheet, and set it in the oven 
with the door open to dry. When very dry, pound 
them fine, and sift them through a coarse sieve or 
fine cullender. The fine crumbs are good to use in 
frying ; the coarse ones are good for puddings. The 
soft part of pieces of bread should be used for dress- 
ing for meats, which would save cutting a whole 
loaf for that purpose. If care is taken of the pieces 
of bread in a family, a great saving may be made, 
for bread is a large item in family expenses. Soft 
crackers pounded make the best crumbs to use in 
frying, also in scalloping oysters. 

THE drippings of beef and pork, clarified, is very 
nice to fry in, instead of lard or butter. To clarify 
it, put the drippings into an iron pot j to a quart of 
fat allow half a pint of cold water ; let it boil until 
the water is boiled out, which may be known by its 
not bubbling. When the water has evaporated.

strain it into an earthen pot, and keep it in a cool 
place for use. 

THE fat from soup stock, and all other fat that 
with proper care accumulates in a kitchen, may be 
used for making soft soap with but very little 
trouble, and a great saving may be made thereby, 
as it is much better than the soap that you get in 
exchange for your house grease. 

To make Soft Soap. Take seventeen pounds 
of potash to twenty of grease ; lay the potash at 
the bottom of the barrel ; boil the grease, and pour 
it on ; put in two pailsful of scalding water, and 
stir it altogether. Fill up the barrel the next morn- 
ing with cold water, stir it up from time to time, 
:'iid iii three days it will be fit for use,
