Cook 1)0(»K to reveal the narrow way. wliei-cin no one may err. which leads to peace 
and hai'iuouy iu the Fatliei-"s house. 

All the recipes hei'ein <i'iven have been carefully formulated, and if i-easonahle 
attention is <i'iven them they cannot fail to ])lease. As the\ are in hai-inou\ with 
the law of liealth, all foods itrejiared accordini^' to their instructions will eft'ectnally 
'"take u]) the white man's hurdeu." 

Till'. .Mazi>aznan llo.Ml'. ("ooK i)OoK is in accordance with t he teacliiu.us of Suu- 
Worshij) philosojjhy. wlii(di holds that ideas and actions are controlled accordinji' to 
our hrcathinii- and diet. Wheat hein^' the standard of the life-l»uildin>i- tissues in 
man. a inc;d must necessarily he (-(lual in pi-oport ion to the element s found in wheat . 




Bread and Bread-Making* 

Till' most iiiiporlant i)n)l)l('iii which coutVouts the hcaltli-scckfi- is t h;it of hrrad- 
niakin<^'. Unless aciuainted with the (diemistry of cookery, erroneous ideas and 
actions will often lead to the i)rodnction of an article fit only for a {^-atlinj? j^nn. 
An old aphorism has it that "l)read is the staff of life," but bread jls it is made 
today by the majority of housewives could fittin<>'ly be dubbed the "staff of death." 
With reference to the ajihoi-ism, we mi'^'ht su<i'ji-est its analysis. "Staff of life" 
would literally mean "supixtrtiuji' life," and in this sense it would be advisable to 
know the kiiuls of bi-ead which are and are not life su])i)oi-tino-, that discrimination 
may the moj-e easil\ ))e made. 

"Staff OF Death." — The bread used by the majority of American people is 
made from white wheat ilour, oi- fine tloui-, and contains 75 per cent starch. As 
there is no nutriment in starch, this kind of bread leads to ])artial strU-vation. 
Many i)hysical and mental derangements may ])e traced to its excessive use. Budding;' 
manhood and womanhood subjected to the strain of school-room work, often rea])s as 
a reward the blighting- touch of l)rain fever instead of a meritoi-ions education when 
nerve force is depleted by partaking- unwisely of carbonaceous foods. Children 
should not be given white bread, especially when spread with butter. It acts as a 
slow i)oison to their svstems and lavs the foundation for untimelv ill health. 

All sui)erflne flours, such as High Patent. Fancy Patent, and numerous others 
now on the market, are sadly deficient in food values, they having ])een lost in the 
milling process, and it is neither profitable nor safe to use them to any extent in 
bread-making (biscuits and hot cakes are included in the category). There is a 
wliite flour called "low^- grade," procured generally only at a flouring mill, which 
contains good food value. It is a creamy-yellow in color, and if i)roperly used will 
make nutritious In-ead. The cost is less than one-half that of the "high i)atent" and 
is far superior as a food, though, of course, somewhat inferior to the whole-wheat 
or graham flour. 

"Staff of Life." — It has been demonstrated l»y chemical analysis and in- 
mnnerable experiments that wheat contains all the elements necessary to sustain life 
indefinitely. By the use of whole-wheat and graham floiu- the "staff of life" will 
ever be at hand to stay the presence of the "grim destroyer." Many new Iirands of 
such flour are now on the market, all ])ossessing jxtints of merit. 

Next to wheat, as food grains, comes rye and l)arley. Bai*le\", though rich in 
nitrogenous matter, is deficient in true gluten and must therefore be mixed with 
either wheat or rye to make good bivad. Rye contains more saccharine than does 
either wheat or l)arle\ . and its nitrogenous matter is closely allied to casein, making 
if an admirable food. 

Oats ai'c food only for horses and lia\e n(» \alne ( I'ather detriment ) asan article 
of diet for man. Oatmeal ])orridge, unless cooked in a double boiler foi- from five 
to seven hours, is practicallx indigestilile and e\ceedingl>' liai-mful to children. It 
should be discai-ded entirel\ . 

Buckwheat cannot be said to be of value foi* food on account of its heating 
pi'operties. Buckwheat cakes, especially, ovei'heat the hlood and cause skin eru])- 
tions and kindred ailments. 

Rice, sago, tapioca, arrowroot, etc., ai-e from SO to !)() pei- cent starch, and 
may be used sparinglx when there is a lack of carbon in foods eaten at one meal. 

Mai/.e, or Indian coi-n (\ellow varietx ) . is rich in carlxm in the form of oil. and 
is valuable as food in cold climates for generating Kodil.x heat. Little, if an\ ,

Hi\'KAi)-M.\Ki\(i. — The use of yeast in bi-cad-makiufi" is not advisaltlc uidcss 
hakiiiy is thoronyh. The process of fcniieiitat ion. when not cheeked l)y sutficient 
heat durinu' Itakiny, still continues after the hi-ead has l)een taken into tlie stomach, 
and when that or^-an is in a weakened condition, yreat distress is a result. State- 
ments have l)een I'rroneouslx made that tlie yeast i)lant is destoxcd durin<i- l»akin<^-, 
hnt if investiji'ation is made it will he found that the crust is i)ractically tlie only 
])ortion of a loaf of lircad which is cntii-el\ free from ferment. All this may l)e 
demonstrate<l liy soakinj^' a piece of white .\cast lircad in a cup of warm watei* for 
alioiit four hours and notiiii;' the <-lianL;-es which take place. 

White \cast hread should not l)e eaten nnless it has lieen toasted to a j^'olden 

l»i-owii in a moderate o\cii. lnit not on to]) of tlie stove. Tlie brown in, u" jjroeess chan}4'es 

the starch to dextrin, which is nutritious and easily digested, and also effeetivel}' 
destroys t he ferment. 

Scieiititic investiti'ation has shown that the excessive use of white yeast bi-ead 
is one of the prime causes of inebriety. As thei-e is a considerable amount of 
alcohol in this kind of bread, its use creates a morbid cravini;' for ardent li(juors. 
This accounts for the i-easoii why many i)ersons are wedded to white yeast Itrejid 
like a bibber to the morning' j>'lass. Should those sanctimonious, motherly souls, 
workin«4- so dilli<;'eiitly in the I'anks of the Temperance Societies, turn their attention 
toward the exclusion of meat, yeast l)read and starch foods from the famil\ table, 
intemperance would be a thin<i' of the past. 

Mot bi-ead. rolls and biscuits for supjx'r are synonymous with "midiii^^lit 
visions." delij>'htful sensations in the epi^'astrium. and t imel> \isits fi-oni the famil>' 
doctor. A word to the wise is suflicient. 

The "soiir-doujj,'ir" method of brcad-makin<^' should Ix'decried. It is indelicate, 
and savoi's of de<>vneration. The same may be said of "soured-l)atter" hot cakes. 
C'ookin>>' changes conditions to a certain extent, but does not remedy the evil. 'I'he 
human stomach is not a httiuu' receptacle for such ferment, it havinji passed bexoiid 
that staofe eons ag'o. 

Hakinjj- powders, as a rule, are not blessed with i)urit\ , and most of their eft'ei-- 
vescing ])roperties are due to the presence of alum and ammonia, both hiuhly in- 
jurious to the system. Pure baking- powder is composed of tartaiic acid and bicar- 
bonate of soda, and the mixttu-e of these two chemicals forms rochelle salts. The 
habitual use of bread made with this ag'ent, thoug-h it might be tei'iiu'd medicated, is 
ver\ unhealthful, producing (lysi)ei)sia and various stomach ailments. 

"Sour-niilk-aud-soda"" maybe classed with the objectionable met hods of Itrcad- 
niaking. it is almost impossible to judge the coi-rect (juantit \ of each article to use, 
and an excess of either will result in a disordered stomach.

Beverages* 



Tilt' lial»it of tea- and coffcc-di-iiikiii*'- has fastened itself upon the Aniei-iean 
people to such an extent that fi'eedom therefrom can only be attained l)y ])ersistent 
effort and added mental force. The present fast aj^c re((uires a careful husl)aiiding

a stumbling block to higher aims and aspirations. The evil effects of tea and coffee

Cakes* 



In tlie making and use of cakes and pasrtiw. it is well to have a eei-tain knowl- 
edge of ehemisti-y and digestion. The j)rincii»al ingredients of <'akes arc white Hour 
(starch), sugar, and oil; all three being carbon, differing oidy in form. When 
se])arate. and jiroperly prepared, they are not difficult to digest; but when cond)ined, 
without due ku(»wle(lge, into one mass, form a mixture r<'volting to a sensative 
stonuu'h. The fact that sugar is digested principally in the mouth and throat, starch 
in the stomai'h. and animal oils cnndsitied in the duodenum, is sunicient evidence 
that liai-mtid results follow the taking into the stoma(di of these three forms of car- 
l)on incorpoi'ated into one consistent mass. Scientitic investigation has jjroved that 
<mly vegetable oils, such as olive, cotton-seed, and cocoanut. can. in limited (puuiti- 
ties, l)e digested in the stomacdi; while animal fats cannot be digested, so must i)ass 
to the duodenum there to be cnndsitied by the action of the bile ami })ancreatic juices 
before tlicy can be assinulatcd. Again, when the stai'cli cells have been surrounded 
with animal fats, the action of the gastiac .piices have V)een impaired and digestion 
is i)revented; fermentation and acidulation follows. From this it can readily be 
.seen that animal fats have no place wliate\ei- in cookery, and that the.x should be 
entirely supei-seded by vegetable oils. Cakes, when made with vegetable oils and 
eaten only in small (piantitics as a dessert, are not harmful to well-being. Do not 
bake cakes in tin i)ans. The oxide of tin\ foi-med by the heat during baking, jx'r- 
meates the cake and when eaten poisons the system. Use pans made fi'om granite- 
ware, eai'thcnwai-e or alunnnum. lie sni'c tlie Hour is iici-fectly dr\ . Have eggs

small ainount of wholesome sweets after a meal, l)ut not before, as di^^estioii would 
be impaired. Do not use elieap candies sold at the stores; they contain <>:lucose 
and poisonous coloring- matter. Avoid the use of syrups which contain glucose. 
Few brands are free from it, and it is better to make all syrup from sugar at home. 
Maple syrup, when pure, is the most healthful, (ilucose is made by subjecting 
corn starch to the action of sulphui-ic acid and heat, and it has been demonstrated 
that the use of this i)roduct will cause l>right's disease and other kidney disorders. 
Sorghum should be used only for cooking, and in moderate qmintitics. The same 
nuiv be said of New Orleans molasses. Thoroughly wash the teeth after eating. 



Coocolate Creams, No. 1« — Pxat whites 
of two eggs to stiff froth, and into this 
beat gradually two teacupfuls powdered 
sugar. Flavor with one-half teasi)ooii- 
ful vanilla and work to stiff' dough, ad- 
ding a little more sugar if necessary. 
Shape into snuill cones and lay on oiled 
plates or paper. Let stand one hour or 
more. Put five ounces shaved chocolate 
into a bowl, set in saucei)an containing 
boiling water and i)ut on the tire. When 
chocolate is melted, remove pan to table 
and drop creams one at a time in choco- 
late, remove with fork and lay on oiled 
plates or paper. They will harden in 
about one-half hour. 

Nut Creams. — As soon as ci-eams are 
laid on plate, over each put the meat of 
any nut desired. (Tround nuts nuiy be 
mixed with the creams l)efore shaping. 
Makes a very dilicious confection. 

Chocolate Creams, No. 2.— Prepare a 
fondant ]>\' putting into a graniteware 
saucepan two cupfuls granulated sugar 
and one cupful water. Stir until sugar 
is nearly dissolved; i)lace on fire and 
heat slowly, but do not stii- oi- jar sauce- 
pan. Wat<'li carefully and note when it 
begins to boil. After boiling ten min- 
utes, drop a small quautit\- into cold 
water; if it hardens sufficiently to form 
a soft ball when rolled l)etween thuml) 
and finger, it has been boiled sufficiently. 
Take saucepan from tire innnediately and 
set in a cool, dry ])lace. When syrup 
has cooled so that ffnger can l)c held in 
it comfoi'tably. pour it into a ]»owl and 
stir with wooden spoon until thick and 
white. When a little dry and hard, take 
out spoon and work with hand until soft 
and smooth. Flavor with a few drops 



of \aiiilla. and, after shaping, cover with 

('ho('(il;ite lis ill l'e('il)e No. 1. 

Chcoanut Candy. — Dissolve one i)ound 
l)ovv(lei-ed sugar in four tablesi)oonfuls of 
water; jjut in graniteware saucepan and 
set on fire; when it begins to boil, stir 
in one pound shredded cocoanut. Con- 
tinue l)oiling until flaky and pour in 
oiled plates or i)ans. Cut in s(|uarcs when 
suffici<'ntl>' cooled. 

Candied Fruits. — Take one pound cut- 
loaf sugar; dip each lumj) into a bowl of 
water and put in preserving kettle. Boil 
down and skim until i)erfectly clear and 
in a candying state. Have ready fruit 
to be candied, such as cherries, grapes, 
curi-ants, oranges divided into sections, 
sliced ])inea])i)le, peaches, ])lums, etc., 
wipe but do not wet. Dip fruit in i)re- 
pared sugar while hot; let renuiin a few 
minutes; remove and put on oiled plates 
or paper to harden. If carefully done, 
will keep indefinitely. 

Nut Candy. — Put one ]tound light- 
brown New Orleans sugar in graniteware 
saucepan and add four tablespoonfuls 
water; stir until dissolved, then put on 
fire and boil. Have ready one pouud 
nut meats and when first sign of grain- 
ing is noticed, stir in nuts; take from 
fire and jxmr in oiled plates or pans. 
When cold cut in bars. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Put two i)ounds 
brown sugar in graniteware saucepan, 
add one-half cake chocolate finely shaved, 
one-half pint sweet cream, one heai)ing 
teasp(»onful cocoanut butter, vanilla

Condiments* 

Great daimvr attends the fiv(iuent use of stimnlat in<i' condiments, and the di- 
K-estive oroans"inav be so habituated to their presence that plain food seems msipid. 
Such conditions cause a perversion of the appetite and a lonj.-; train of evds follows. 
Spi<-v condiments atford uo nutrition and are not essential to the process of dij?es- 
tion'in a. healthv state of the svstem. Though they may in some cases, sissist the 
action of a del)ilitated stomach for a time, yet their continual use never fads to pro- 
duce a weakness of that or<,mn, the etfect l)einc>- as that of alcohol or other stnnu- 
lauts:— present relief at the expense of the future sufferino-. The excessive use of 
salt pepper, vineo'ar, and nmstard, causes liver and nervous atfections; the same may 
be said of other spices, vet to a less degree. Black and white peppers and nutmeg-s 
should not be used: thev are active poisons and produce dangerous results, even ni 
small (|uantities. Horse-radish and nmstard are first-c<msnis. and are not harmful 
if used occasionallv. Cloves, allspice, mace, and cinnamon should be used spar- 
inglv. Ked pepper, ginger, and salt have medicinal properties and their use m 
moderate proportions is verv beneficial. Vinegar should not be used, as the acetic 
acid which it contains is highly injurious to the delicate lining of the stomach; 
substitute Hme or lemon juice. The use of savory lierl)s, such as thyme, parsley, 
sage, sweet marjoram, mint, and garlic, and caraway, celery, and dill seeds m soups. 
salads, sauces, etc., are very beneficial and act as a very nnld stimulant.

sulphur and phosphorus, which forms nearly two-thirds by weififht of the perfectly 
dry yolk. If ej^-j^'s are to be servinl in a wholesome stat<'. it is necessary to pi-ei)are 
them intelligently, with a thorouj>h knowledo-e of the effect of heat n])(m theii- com- 
ponent parts. In eookino- ej4-j;'s, it nuist be remembered that albumen is comi)letely 
coaji'ulated below a tem])erature of 170 degrees Falnvnheit. and any higluM- heat will 
nuike this substance tough, horny and indigestible. Hggs, being a concentrated

they will not be harmful provided they have been hard-boileil or i)oached accoi-ding 
to instructions following. Eggs, hard-boiled or poached at a temp«'i-atui'e of -JTi 
degi'ees Fahrenheit, or fried, are deleteri(ms to i)ersons sulfering from these dis- 
orders, because the all)umen, having been rendered tough and indigestible, ferments 
easily in the stomach and forms acids poisonous to the system. Eggs should not be 
eaten when fried, but raw or in custards. ])oiled or jxtached accoi-ding to following 

methods : 

80FT-BoiLiN(4.— This method is not as advisable as those sub-secpient. as the 
albumen is only partially coagulated and in this state is not so easily digested. 
Allow one pint of water to each egg. If \<»u wish to boil six eggs, i)ut them in a 
large pan; take six pints of water, put in a kettle (.)■ pan and bring to steaming 
point (not boiling), over the tire; pour water over the eggs and set on back portion 
of stove live to eight minutes. If the water has l)een the i-ight temperature, the 

eggs will be ready to serve. 

HARD-BoiLiX(i.— Put in cold water, bi-ing to 1(0 degi-ees Fahrenheit (about steam- 
ing point), set on back of stove for forty-five minutes. In this way the albumen 
witl be reduced to a jellv-Iike sTibstanee, easily digested, and the yolks will be dry and 
mealv. A double boiler may be used to advantage, tlie temperature l)eing more 
easily controlled, but the water in outer vessel must be continuously kept near the 
boiling point, as the contents of inner boiler will be heated to a le:--, degree. 

Pr)ACiiix<T.— Put eggs in water of a temperature of i:}2 to IGO degrees. Have 
enough water to cover, and as soon as film has formed over yolk an(' Avhite is set 
and fellv-like. remove from water and serve at once. The use of e'.rg-poachers is 
advised*. Always keep water below boiling point. Remove the life g«-nn from eggs 
broken for poaching or cooking puri)oses. as it is heating to the system. 

Custards. — It is preferable to cook custards in a double boiler rather than 
baking in an oven. If put in a china or earthenware bowl, set in a steam cooker 
and boil until done, the flavor w^ill l)e found admirable. Do not flavor custards 
with nutmeg; this si)ice is objectionable because its i)oison<ms properties often pro- 
duce (diolera morbus. 

SCKAMHLKI) eggs and omelets should be cooked at low telliperatui-e 111 doultie

dip them into boiling water for a fcAV

egg; garnisli with parsley or cress and 
serve hot . 

Deviled Eggs, — Take six hard-boiled 
eggs, which have been droi)i)ed into cold 
w-ater immediately after boiling; peel and 
cut crosswise, taking care not to break 
whites. Take out yolks and nib tlieiii

Fruits* 



Fruits are nature's jjanacca for human ills. They contain all the medicinal 
properties needed to kee]) man in a state of health. Their judicious use will "cool 
the fevered brow and stay the tottering footsteps to the grave." As there is such 
a great variety of fruits, it is scarcely possil)le to speak separately of every one in a 
publication with limited space, but a mention will be made of the most important 
ones indigenous to the United States. Then, too, every person differs from every 
other i)erson as to temi)erament and tastes, and no fast rule can be given which would 
govern all cases. Every person must learn by experience when a certain fruit is 
not agreeal)le. Tlie ])i'incii)al i)roi)ortions of each fruit mentioned will i»e given. 
and deductions nnist be drawn accordinu'lv. 



Apples, in the ])ast, have oftimes been 
underestimated as to their royal (lualities. 
and it is only in late yeai-s that their true 
values have been universally recognized. 
The ai)ple may be justly considered the 
queen of fruits, though of course, this 
has no bearing on Eve's weakness in the 
garden recorded by the ancient allegory. 
The nutritive value of the ai)ple is about 
14 per cent, and consists chiefly of car- 
bohydi-ates and vegetable acids. It also 
contains a generous amount of phos- 
phorus, which niakt^s it i)articularl> 
valuable to brain workers and jx-rsons 
with ner\-ous tendencies; also to children 
and to the aged. The apples have an 
additional advantage over other fruits in 
that they can easily be kei)t on hand at 
all seasons of the year in a fresh condition 
without canning. Only the soft and 
juicy varieties, when rijjc, should l)e 
eaten raw: those hard and partiall\ un- 
ripe should be boiled, pai-ti<*ularl\ the 
variety known as the Ben 1 )a vis. A])ples 
are rich in iron and ai-e valuabe in cases 
of aiuemia. 

Apricots ai-e the result of a ci-oss 
between a ])each and a plum, and offer 
little of value for food. As a I'ule. the\ 



are woody and often cause distress to 
those who eat them. 

Bananas are a nutritious food wlu'U 
ripened in their native haunts, l)ut those 
sold in northern and remote markets are 
decidedly unfit to eat. Partial decompo- 
sition has taken place during the ripen- 
ing i)rocess, and fei-mentation begins 
almost as soon as the fruit has been 
taken into the stomach. Bananas for 
shii)ment have l)een picked when green, 
and often stored before rijx'ning in damj) 
cellars, the odors of which the fruit 
readily absorbs. The banana contains 
about 14 per cent nutriment, consisting 
chiefly of carbohydrates, which, when 
the fruit is green, is i)i-incipall\ in the 
form of starch; but in the i-ipening 
process on the stalk this starch is 
changed to grape sugar and soluable 
starch, which form a valuable fo(»d suited 
to warm climates. The lirown variety 
is sweeter than the yellow ami of tijier 
grain. 

Blackberries furnish a vahndde combi- 
nation of acids. i)hosphates. ii-on and 
other miiici-als in an organized state;

is a deadly |)oison and should in no case 
betaken into the stomach. Lemon juice

Grapes weri' of th<' eai-th when it was 
young and drank its gloi'ies from the 
gates of i)aradise. No fruit has more 
excellent food values than the grape. 
Fi'om time immemorial it has graced the 
tallies of the ri(di and pooi' alike, and 
furnished them with Mine unequalled by 
the nectar of the gods. Bread and wine 
ai'e still the (diief articles of diet of 
many who li\c in the ( )i"ient . The salts 
and acids whi(di this fruit contains enrich 
the blood and do nuicli to keep it in a 
state of i)urity. The seeds and rind are 
indigestible and should not be eaten. 
A glass of wine taken at each meal 
instead of coffee or tea would "oiien wide

nnfermented grape juice is meant; that 
which has been impregnated with fer- 
ment is not a food, though, in some 
cases, it ma\ be used as a nietlicine.

hydrocyanic acid (a deadly jjoison) in a 
very weak solntion, and if eaten in 
qnantities. i)]'odnce deleterionse effects. 
The kernel of the i)lnm, cherry, apricot, 
nectarine and bitter almonds also <'ontain 
poisonons ])ropei*ties and slionld not be 
eaten. 

Pears, in most cases, have a woody 
fiber which is indifj'estible. Those varie- 
ties wliicli are .inicy and tender, and 
which are not i^rainy, may be eaten 
occasionallx to advantage. The chief 
vahies are in tli<' juices which contain 
organized mineral salts, such as iron and 
sodium, also i)hosi)liorus, etc. 

Plwms c(»ntain an acid which is injui'i- 
ous to the digestive organs of many 
})ersons. and should not 1)6 eaten w'hen 
deleterious etfects are noticed. Prunes 
are a very nutritious fruit and should be 
eaten whenever desired. They afford 
the highest nerve and brain food, sui)i)ly 
heat and waste, but are not muscle 
feeding. In all instances when dried 
prunes are usimI. pour off the first water 
after cooking ten minutes: add fi-esh 
boiliuu' water to conci- and Itoil six to 



eight hours. This makes them tender 
and very delicious. In all cases the first 
watei' slK)uld lie lemosed. as it eai'i-ies 
away the sulphur and alkali used dui-ing 
the process of drx ing and preparing for 
the market. 

Pomegfranates, though indigenous to 
the Orient, ai-e successfully grown in tiie 
warmer jxtrtions of tin- United States. 
They ai'<' very delicious, though they 
contain no known medicinal properties. 

Raspberries, like blaekben-ies, should 
be used only for making wines and 
jellies. Tlie seeds and pvdp affect the 
digestive organs in such a wa>' as to 
cause great distress. They should not, 
in any case, be giv<'n to invalids or con- 
valescents. The juice is very refreshing 
and may be freely used. 

Strawberries are ver\ Ix'ueficial. and 
make their appearance in the spring and 
early summer in time to be of great 
value as a bh)od purifier. The>' should 
be freely eaten, but well masti(*ated to 
reduce the seeds which might, in som<' 
instances, cause distress to the stomach. 
Strawl>erries are rich in iron. 

Pineapples are from "the garden of the 
gods." They furnish a fo<»d of great 
value to those who live in troi)ical climes. 
The juice is very soothing to the diges- 
tive organs, and numerous cases of 
chronic dyspepsia have l)een completely 
cured by its use. When canned ))ine- 
apples are used, select those which have 
been preserved in glass jars in preference 
to the ones in tin cans, as the acid forms 
a ])oisonous oxide in the latter case. ^ 



Jellies* 



.\s an art icle of food, jellies may be eaten occasionally. In many cases they 
cause a disturbed condition of the stomach, and persons with ol)ese or diabetic 
tendencies should cai-efnll\ a\<»id their use; also candies, syrui)s and sugar. -Jellies 
ma\ be used to advantage in making refreshing wines l)y dissolving in sufficient 
cold water to dilute to taste. Serve in glasses after a meal. Space forbids the 
giving of i-ecipes for making the various fi'uit jellies. Select the fruit desired, boil 
in i)o]-<-elaiii oi- graniteware kettle, adding a little water if necessary, until soft: 
strain and mash through a suitable cloth, fiannel preferred, and allow one pound of 
granulated sugar to each ])int of juice. ]>oil again for five minutes, then ;idd the 
sugiU- and boil until it jellies. All jellies should be |)i-eser\-ed in glassware, nexcr 
metal, and should be kept in a cool, dark i)lace, free from danqjuess. Light is very 
destructive to th<'ir keei)ing ipialities. The use of jellies by ])icnic and camping- 
out pai'ties t'oi- making a]ipeti/iiig di-inks. must l»e tried to be appreeiated. On

Meat. 



That meat is not food f<»r man. needs not to lie foi'cefuily ])i-esente(l totliecnlt- 
ni-ed and intellectual mind. This fact is as readily recoo-ni/ed l)y tliosc luiving 
refined sensil)ilities. as the simple law that i)urit.v cannot enuuate from de^'i-adatiou. 
Flesh eating' is a remnant of man's ])y<;'on(' bai'harism which sliould he lon.u' for- 
}4'ottt'n. At the dawn of the twentieth centuiw the oi-icnt ii.uht of wisdom more 
foreefull.N hci-alds forth the admointion that num must cease to detile (Jod's temple. 
The so-called reli^'iouists, who "'pra\ in high places" and strive so earnestly to 
show their fellow-men the i-iyhteous road which leads to peace aud everlasting life, 
foro'et that they should first seek purity in themselves Ix'fore they ji'uide the erriujj 
ones alon»>' the narrow way. Purity of mind can only follow pui-ity of body, and 
lofty sentiments and ideas cannot eminate from poik chops, sausa^ivs or chicken 
fricassee. The eatin<i' of meat, in many instances, has been the cause of ^i'l-eat dis- 
tress in social and family circles; and it has been known to chanu'c affairs of state 
and i)lun<»e whole nations into i-uin. It is well known to students of history that 
the dinner eaten by Xepoleon the (ii-eat just lit^fore the battle of Leipsic ])roved so 
indiy:estil)le that the monarcli's brain )>ecame confused, and. as a result, the battle 
was lost. The eel stews of Mohannned II ke])t the whole em])ire in a state of nerv- 
ous excitement, and one of the nu';it pies which Kin^' Philip failed to digest caused 
the revolt of the Nt^herlands. The immutable law of evolution has desi<>ned that 
life must jiass fi*om the miuei-al kint>'dom to that of the vej^'ctable, and from the 
veg'etable kiuf^dom to that of the animal. Alan's trans<>'i*essiou of this law by the 
eatin<>- of flesh has brouo'ht the human race to a state of degeneracy which time and 
righteous living alone can change. "Thou shalt not kill,'' is a divine connnand- 
raent, given to man at the dawn of his creation to guide him in a life of righteous- 
ness and imrit.v. Closes endxxlied this same commandment in the law which he 
foi'undated to govern the children of Tsrad. The ]ienalt.\' foi- its (lisol)edience has 
always been the same, — death. "Thou shalt not kill" is not confined to man alone, 
l)ut governs the entire animal kingdom. Tiie killing of an ox is a transgression of 
the law the same as the killing of a man: the i)enalt.\' remains the sanu'. Kill not 
at all. and eat not that which has l)een killed. The eating of flesh will not build 
up cellular tissue in man; this can only l)e done by a vegetal)le diet. Flesh foods 
load the blood with impurities and cause rapid disintegration, making of man a 
walking graveyard and a human garbage l)arrei. If man did not eat ])otatoes, 
white .^■east bi-ead. and meat, nor use narcotic beverages, such as s])irituous li(|Uors, 
tea. and coffee. !)() pei- cent of the evils existing toda\ would be renio\"ed. 



Nuts. 



The pro))cr food foi- man is an intelligent cond)ination of fruits, grains, nuts 
and \'egctal)les. Au infinite variety ma.\' be secured suited to all conditions and 
occasions. Fi-uits. on aei-oimt of t heir peculiai- construct ion. should not be eaten 
with vegetables, but with nuts or grains. Nuts, becaust' of tlieii- oily nature, 
should ])e used in combination with fruit, the acids of the latter aiding gi-e;itly in 
digestion. The> ma\ be used to great advantage with vegetaltles and gi-ains. 
Pojicorn eaten with black walnuts or hickoi-y nuts foi-ms new flavors wliirh are deli- 
cious and aitpeti/ing. Nut prc])arations are very wholesome, but should be used in 
small (juantities as they ai'c a condensed food. Fveiw family slnadd have a haiul

Pinon Butter. — Koast and 



•iTind pine 
nuts and i)repare same as other nut l)ut- 
ters. Very fine foi- fiavoi-in^' soups, etc. 

Filberts. — Blanch same as almonds. 
Place in moderate oven for a few min- 
utes until dry and ci-isp. (Jrind to fine 
meal on mill. I'sed same as others. 

Brazil Nut Butter. — After shellin-4'. 
hlanch and roast fVn- a few minutes in 
moderate oven. Grind to very fine meal. 
Used in small quantities, gives a deli- 
cions flav(n- to eeival iireparations. Px't- 
ter when freshly i)repaT'ed. 

Walnut Butter, — Use the papei--sliell 
English walnut. After shelling, blanch 
same as almonds. I'ut in oven until 
slightly In-owned, then gi-ind to fine meal 
on mill. Pack in air-tight glass jars and 
set in cool ])lace. May be used Avith any 
frnit or grain dish. 

Hickory Nuts. — After l)eing shelled, 
set tlie kernels into moderate oven for a 
fcAV minutes, then grind on mill. Pnt 
in air-tight glass jars and set away in 
cool place. A little nut oil may be added 
on top, if desired. Very fine for ftavor- 
ing s()U])s, symposia and other dishes. 

Peanut Butter. — Roast a quantity of 
shelled peanuts in moderate oven for 
about thirty minutes, enough to give 
them a brown color; remove the skins 
when cold and grind in a mill to fine 
paste, the finer the better. A splendid 
l)utter for bread, and sandwi(*hes; very 
fine for fiavoring soups, sym])osia, etc. 

Peanutta. — Put a (jnantity of shelled 
l)eannts into a sIoav oven for twenty min- 
utes. Do not allow them to g(4 brown. 
Take tliem out: when cold the l)rown 
skins mav be easily rul)bcd oft*, (irind 



to a fine, smooth paste on a mill. I'ut 
three cupfuls ground ])eanuts into a 
sauce pan; add five cn})fuls watei- and 
boil over slow fire, stirring frequently, 
for foi-ty-five minutes. Pour into por- 
celain (lisli and set in cool place. Very 
fine in soui)s, in cereals, synqxtsia. or as 
butter to si)read on bread. 

Chestnuts. — The large Italian or Ajjpe- 
nine <'liestnuts are the best. l>oil them, 
when fi-esh, for twenty minutes, then 
bake in hot oven for ten minutes, or 
until mealy; punctnre shells with knife 
or fork to i)revent 1)ursting. Peel and 
grind into fi(mr. Put into jars and set 
in dry place; will keej) indefinitely. May 
be used in soups, symposia, bread, grains. 

Almond Butter. — I'se the paper-shell 
sweet almonds. After shelling, blanch 
and set them in oven until thoroughly 
dry and hard, then grind to fine meal on 
a mill. If desired, they may be previ- 
ously roasted, aftei* blanching, in a mod- 
erate oven until a golden In-own before 
grinding. Pack in air-tight glass jars. 
Very delicious for si)reading on In-ead 
and for fiavoring cei-eal dishes. 

Butternut and Black "Walnut Butters. 
All pi-(q>arations from these nuts are bet- 
ter in a fresh state, as they do not keep 
long without becoming rancid, (irind 
aftei- shelling; used for fiavoring same 
as othei- nut butters. May be slightly 
browned in oven before gi-inding, if 
desired. When eating black walnuts and 
l)utternuts, they should be acconqianied 
l)y a generous (pumtity of pop corn. 
This i)revents the ri(di oils from laying 
too heavily on the stomach and jtossibly 
causing distress. 



Oil 



S» 



Animal oils should not be used hi'cause they pollute the blood and ai-e indigesti- 
l)le. P^oi- this reason all foods mixed with them partake of the same conditions. 
The feeding of childi-en with i)otatoes tried in animal oils is little short of crime, 
because the results are e((ual to those of poison. The same is true of meat, white 
yeast bread and nai-cotic beverages. Another objection to the use of animal oil 
for frying is its lia1)i!ity to become overheated, liurnt fat contains acrolein, an 
iri-itating and highl\ -poisonous li(pii(l dexcloiied during Inii-ning. \'eg('table oils

Pickles and Catsups* 



Pickles should l»c eaten \cry sparinj^lx , and, if possible, not at all when jire- 
pared witli \ inej^ar. as this condiment is deleterious to <i healthful condition of the 
stomach. Cucumber pickles are (piite harmful because they are difficult to (li<i('st 
when i)reserved in \ ine,uai-. 



Pickled Beets.— P>oil beets until soft: 
peel and slice them, then pom- on lemon 
juice while tlie\ are hot and set away to 
pool . 

Indian Chetney. — Pare, core and chop 
in suuill s(iuare pieces half a pound of 
sour api)les: add one-half jxtund each of 
tomatoes, brown sn<;ar, stoned raisins, 
one-fourth pound each onions and j^'arlic, 
and two ounces each cayenne pep])er and 
ground u-inj^'ci-, and one (juart lemon 
juice. Mix all well to^'etliei- and put in 
eloselx -covered jar. 

Piccalilli, — Cut one peck of j^i'een toma- 
toes and six onions in thin slices, pack 
in layers in earthenware jar altei-nately 
witli one teaeupful of salt. Let stand 
over ni^ht: in the mornin*^' pour off 
li(|ui(l that has formed, add four green 
pepi)ers ami choi)all fine. Put the whole 
in a ])ocelain-lined kettle with one ]»int 
of ])ure eider vinegar (or lemon juice) 
and a tablesi)()onful each of cloves, ein- 
uanu»n, and white mustard seed. Cook 
until soft and sweeten to taste. Pack in 
earthenware oi- glass jars and set away 
in cool, di-y ])lacc. 

Tomato Catsup. — Scald, peel and core 
a peek of sound, ripe tomatoes. Mash 
as if for stewing. Season with one 
tablespoonful ground cinnamon, one-half 
teas]ioonful ca.xennc pep])ci'. one table- 



spoonful each of cloves, allsi)iee and 
nuu'e, and three large onions cut very 
tine; salt to taste. Put all in porcelain- 
lined kettle to boil; when tomatoes are 
thoroughly cooked, rub them through a 
sieve to get out the seeds, s])ice. etc. 
After straining return to kettle and boil 
until thick like cream. Set aside ami 
when cold ])ut into (dean bottles, tilling 
each to within one-half inch of the cork, 
then i)ouring in on to)) of each a tea- 
si)0()nful of salad oil . The bottles should 
be kei)t in a cool, dry i)lace, resting on 
their sides. 

Persian Pickle. — Take one (piai-t of 
small green tomatoes, one <imirt of small 
onions, one (piart string beans, om^ eauli- 
Hower. one cui)ful nasturtium seed, two 
(puii'ts pure ci(U'r vinegai', two i)oumls 
sugar, two ounces tuiMiieric. two ounces 
nuistard seed, one cujjful olive oil. two 
(miu'es ground mustard. Par-boil the 
onions, beans, and canlitiower separately : 
l)ut the nasturtium seed and green toma- 
toes in bi-ine for twenty-four ho;n*s; heat 
vinegar, mix tumeric and nuistard in a 
little cold \inegai-, add to hot vinegai'. 
stirring with wooden spoon until thick, 
then add oil. sugar and nuistard seed. 
Cook four minutes and i)our ovei- i)i-e- 
l)ared vegetables. Pack in carthcnwai-c 
or glass jars. 



Pies* 

There can l)e lu) obj<'ction to the eating of pic^s if they ai'c well baked and their 
crusts do not contain aninud oils. Dotighy pies of ghostl\ hue, flavored with 
the extract of swim* adi])ose tissue, can scarcely be expected to answci' as an aftei-- 
dinner relish foi- every hungi-y m<irtal. in the making of i)ic crust, use only vege- 
tal)lc oils, such as oli\e. cotton-seed or cocoauut. Clai'ilied l)Utter ma\ be used.

but it is considered ()l)j(M'ti()n;d)l(' on account of its indiuvsti])ility. Persons sul)ject 
to liver and stoniacli disoi-dei-s sliould not use it, nor any other animal oil, for that 
matter. Admixtures of animal fats and stai-cli. such as ])ies, pastry, etc.. should 
not be ^iven to children. Always bake pies until both upper and lower crusts are 
a o-olden brown, otherwise they are iudigestilde aud lay hea\il\ on llie stomach. 
The human stomach has develoiied beyond the diuestino- of raw slai-<-h, and atten- 
tion to this fact will alleviate much sufferin<4'. Students, and others, in the school- 
i-oom will sooner or later pay the penalty foi- the continued eatiu"- of noon-day 
lunches composed of white ])read ancl half-baked pie im])re<>'mite(l with animal fats. 



Pie Crust, — Sift to,u'etlier one (piai't of 
tloui" with one teaspoonful salt; add tw<»- 
thirds cupful cocoanut, olive oi' cotton- 
seed oil. workin<4' it in thorou<>-hly ; then 
pour in o'radually one cupful cold watei*. 
Knead into firm dou^'h with least possible 
liandlinj*'; roll out on floured board to 
tliin slieet and lay on graniteware pie 
jtlates. Before putting- in the ])ie mix- 
tui-e, wet the crust dcmgh when in the 
l)Iates with beaten white of an egg to 
pi-event juices soaking through and mak- 
ing crust soggy. Bake pies in moderate 
oven, being careful to brown the lower 
as well as upi)er crust. 

Apple. — To make an apple pie that is 
a charm, it is necessary to use finely- 
flavored and tart ap])les. Pare and core 
them, put them with a little water into 
a graniteware sancei)an over the fire and 
boil until soft. Add sugar to taste and 
lieat to smootli cream. Put generous 
quantity into each crust-lined plate, add 
a dash of ground cinnamon, put on ujjper 
crust aud bake in bi-isk oven to golden 
brown. 

Apple-Custard. — To each cu})ful of 
ai)i»le sauce, add two well-beaten eggs 
and one-half cupful fresh milk. Fill 
crust-lined i)lates, sprinkle on a little 
grouml cinnamon, or add vanilla fiavor- 
ing, cut strips and lay crosswise, then 
l)ake in oven. 

Cocoanut-Custard. — This vai-iation is 
made ])y adding grated cocoanut to the 
custai'd l)efore l)aking. Treat same as 
custard i)ie. If shredded cocoanut is 
used, it should be boiled in milk until 
soft. 

Custard. — Make custard of three well- 
1)eaten eggs, two tal)lesi)oonfuls white 
sugar and one pint sweet milk, using 
llavor to taste. Put in ci'ust-lined ])lates 
and bake in slow oven. When done, 
take out and si)read ovci- with the beaten 
whites of eggs and sugar, i-i'tui-ii to oven 



and bake until sliglitlx bi-owiied. Set 
aside to eool. tiiell se|-\'e. 

Date. — S<»ak one i)ound of dates over 
night, stew until tln-x- can be mashed 
through a sieve. Mix with one (juart of 
milk, three eggs, and a little salt. Bake 
with under, crust only in moderate oven. 
This amount of filling will make three 
pies. Figs may l)e used in phice of dates 
for variety, but they will need to be 
finely chopi)ed. 

Fruit. — Select fruit desired, such as 
grai)es, peaches, plums. ])ears. etc., stew 
them well done; iiut l)etween two crusts 
and bake to golden l)rown. Flavor with 
gi'ound cinnamon or use extract to suit 
taste. 

Lemon. — Soak one-half cupful ci-acker- 
dust for one houi- in one cui)fnl milk. 
Cream together one-half cupful powdered 
sugar two tal)lesi)oonfuls cocoanut butter 
or olive oil. whij) in the beaten white of 
one and yolks of three eggs, reserving 
the remaining wliites for a meringue. 
Add the juice and grated riml of two 
lemons, then the so.dvcd cracker-dust. 
Pour all in crust-lined plate and bake iu 
moderate oven to golden brown. Make 
a mei'ingue of the whites l)eaten with two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugai-. \Vlien 
l)ie is done. s))i'ead over the meringue, 
return to oven long enough to harden. 
Sei've cold. 

Strawberry. — Put ciust in plate, bake 
in oxen until nicely l»rowned. Takeout 
and till with fresh. ri])e straw])en"ies; 
spi-iidcle with tinely-i)ow(lered sugar, then 
spread ovei" the entire pie the well-beaten 
whitt'S of eggs and sugar. Put again in 
oven and bake until slightly browned. 
Use no to]i <'rust. 

Mince. — Make a mock mince meat as 
follows: Take one pound of washed and 
di-ied cui-rants. one pound seeded raisins, 
one i)ound tinely-cut citron, one i)ouud 
sugar, one-half teas|)oonfu] salt, the juice

It is, indeed, a trite, but old, sayin^' that '"the proof of the i)uddin<if is in the

proof rests on the digestive organs like unto a nightmare. Pure and fresh ingredi- 
ents, othei' than animal, ])lace(l in the hands of an intelligent cook may be resolved 
into '"a mid-sunnner-night's di'eam," with all the parai)hei-nalia to match. The

Symposia a la Culinarie^ 



An effort has been made to j^'ive in this dei)artment suitable dishes desi«>'ne(l to 
take the place of meats. In many instances when the housewife has resolved to 
adopt a new regime, one which leads to a Ix'tterment of mental and physical con- 
ditions, and one which excludes all animal foods whatsoever from the daily menu, 
she is often at a loss to know just what to select when sui)i)lyinu' the family table. 
The task need no hMij^'er be dititicult, for in the preparation of these dishes others 
of similar nature will snog-est themselves, and the various items may be procured 
accordingly. To obtain the liest I'esults, there is only one special rule to lie o1»- 
served, — do not use fruits together wdth vegetables. Vegetables should be com- 
bined with grains and nuts; fruits with grains and nuts; but not vegetaldes with 
fruits, except in certain instances. Onions and garlic maybe coml)ined with ajiples 
(soui- api)les) without detracting from the l)eneticial (|ualities of either. Do not 
use raw Hour in making symjjosia: brown it in a moderate oven, and stii- occasion- 
ally to prevent burning. Wlien using bread, it should always be cut in slices and 
toasted to a golden 1)rown in a moderate oven. It is necessary to ])rocure a mill, or 
small grinder, with which to grind the toasted bread, crackers, shredded-wheat 
biscuits, nuts, grains, etc., for use in these recipes. These mills are sold by vari- 
ous firms for $2 and upwards, and are indispensible to all well-regulated kitchens. 
It is well when jmrchasing nuts to select those which Jiave been shelled; they are 
the cheaper in the end. They have been i)ut through^pecial machines which take 
out the kernels in a comi)aratively unbi-oken condition, besides there is a great sav- 
ing of time. The nuts should l)e fresh, otherwise they will be rancid and unfit to 
eat. Use graniteware, p<»rcelain, or aluminum dishes for baking ]nirposes. Tin 
is easily oxidized and often j^oisons the food. To facilitate a variation in sym- 
])osia, we give the following formulae, the use of which will satisfy the most fastid- 
ious taste. Select for use only strictly fresh articles. Oi-een fruits and vegetables 
which have become wilted after being picked, have lost their life-giving i)roperties 
and are so much dead matter. The>' shouhl be eaten as soon as ])ossible after 
being i)icked, observing particularly that all are free from blemishes, and that there 
are no evidences of decay. As soon as disintegration sets in. the entire fi-uit or 
vegetal)le, as the case may be, has been ])ermeated with effete matter that produces 
like conditions in evei-ything with wliich it comes in conta<"t. 

Formula No. 1. — (Condnning Fruit, Nuts, and Cereals.) One cujiful cereals: 
choice may be made of crackei'-dust, finely-ground toasted bread crund)s, oi- browned 
flour. Three cupfuls finel\-cliopi)ed fruit: choice ma\' be made of any fruit sei)a- 
rate, or they may be mixed. One cupful nuts: nut butfei-s may be used, or tinely- 
chopix'd or ground kernels of any nuts desired. One tables])ooiiful tinel\ -clio])ite(l 
savory hei'bs; they may be green or dried, preferably green. Two well-l)eaten eggs. 
One eui)ful licpdd; milk, water, or fruit juices maybe chosen. One teaspoonful 
salt. A little cinnamon or v;inilla for flavoring.

Vegetables* 



All vegetables for food should lie sti'ictl_\ fresh. whi<-li condition is easily indi- 
cated when they break or snaj) crisply. Home-grown V(^getal)les, such as lettuce, 
spinage, pease, beans, etc., shonld be gathei-cd in the morning when wet with dew. 
Vegetables are imi)rove(l by being pnt in cold water before cooking. A very small 
quantity of cayenne i)epper put into the water will somewhat neutralize the dis- 
agreeable odor arising from the ])oiling of onions, garlic, etc. Green vegetaliles 
sh{^tuld be cooked in water that is just beginning to boil, and which has l)een slightly 
salted, allowing one tablespoonful of salt to two quarts of water. Watei" which 
has boiled long is Hat, and destroys the flavor and appearance of the vegetables. 
Poui- otf the first water aftei- boiling ten to twenty minutes, then pour on a fresh 
supply which has been heated to the l)()iling i)oint. This i)rocess remo\'es the 
poisonous acids which might otherwise i)roduce injury. The vegetables which ripen 
above the ground are i^referable for food, as they contain a greater per cent of life- 
giving i)roi)erties : those which ripen lieneath the surface should be used sparingly, 
as they contain many soil substances which are injurious to the system. \"egeta- 
bles are not in their entiret\' food stuffs; they are classed more jn-operly as elimi- 
nators, and are a nt^-essity in a well-balanced meal to furnish waste mattei- for the 
moi-e solid grain and nut foods, besides furnishing valuable salts and acids. 



Asparagus. — Put in l)oiling water with 
a little salt : drain oft the water aftei" lioil- 
ing five minutes; i)onr on fresh boiling- 
hot water and boil again for fiftt^'U min- 
utes. Add a little salt and olive oil. 
Serve with toast. The toi)s of asjjaragus 
should be a i)ui"i»h' color, not green, to 
insure their being edible. This vegeta- 
ble contains valuable salts and acids, and 
should be freely eaten. Discard woody 
or tough ])ortion. as it is indigestible. 

Beets. — Use oidy the crisp red varie- 
ties. The large sugar beets are woody, 
and of little value except for the saccha- 
rine matter which tliey contain. P>oil 
whole, without cutting: then slice and 
ser\'e with lemon juice, but not vinegai'. 

Baked Beans. — Wash the desired quan- 
tity of beans and soak ovei- night in suf- 
ficient watei- to cover; in the moi'iiing 
drain them and })oil in fi-esh water for 
fifteen minutes: jioui- off the watei-. jiut 
beans into an earthen ci'ock. add one 



tablespoonful molasses, one teaspoonful 
mustard, one tablesi)oonful olive oil. a 
little salt, and sufficient water to cover. 
Put a lid on the crock and cook slowly 
all day in the oven. Add water occa- 
sionally until one hour before taking 
from the oven. Serve with catsu)). 

Cabbagfe. — 1 )o not boi 1 eabl )age . B( )iled 
cal)bage and sanerkrout are practically 
indigestible aiul should not be eaten, 
^lake a cold slaw l\v slicing the cabbage 
fine: ser\c with or without lemon juice, 
not vinegar. Thick, sweet cream and 
lemon juice make a very palatable di-ess- 
ing. A small pinch of mnstai-d may V)e 
added if desired. 

Cauliflower. — Tie up the caulifiower in 
a coarse tarlatan and boil one to two 
houi-s in watei- to which has been added 
a little salt. Drain and lay in deep dish. 
Ileal one cupful milk; add a little Hour 
which has Ix'cn previously creamed in a

the desired (|uantitv of milk into which 
has been creamed a little Hour. l>oil 
five or ten minutes, then serve. Carrots 
ai-e l)etter use tm- soui)s. as the\ have 
no s])eeial food vahies. 

Celery. — Tliis ve^'etahle is pai-ticularly 
valuable as a l)lood i)rurilier. It aids in 
restoriufj- depk'ted nerve forces, tones up 
the system, and its use is highly bene- 
ficial in cases of nervous prostration and 
kidne\ disorders. .Ma\ l)e used to ad- 
vantai^'e in shujjs. 

Corn Timbales. — P>eat tive ej^<is until 
liylit: add one-half teaspoonful salt, one 
tal)lespoonful oil, one eu])ful eraeker- 
dust, and one pint green corn which has 
been grated from the cob. Pour into 
oiled tind)ale moulds which luixc been 
(lusted with tinely-(diopi)ed parsley. Set 
in a baking pan of boiling watei-. cover 
with a sheet of oiled i)aper and cook in 
oven for twenty nunutes. Serve with 
tomato sauce. (ii-<'en coi-n on cob should 
be boiled for one hour. or. what is bet- 
ter, sh(mld be steann'd in a steam cooker 
one to two liours. Do not serve with 
butter or aninuil fats: it is the cause of 
a<-ute and dangerous stomach disorders. 

Cucumbers are of vabu' for salads, and 
should be used only when prepared as 
such. They c(»ntain no nutriment, but 
are very cooling to the blood when sei-ved 
Avitli lemon .juice, l)ut not \inegar. 

Dandelion. — Prei»ai-e same as spinage. 
Its bloo(l-i>ui-if\ ing properties are many. 

Boiled Onions. — Peel onions and put 
in coNcred sauc('|»an witli cold water and 
lioil one houi-. Winn done, add (»ne 
tablespoonful (diopped parsley, and a 
little fl(mr mixed with sweet milk: boil 
five minutes, then serve. Young or old 
onions may be used as prefericd. 

Spinagfe. — Wash desired (plant ity of 
spimige. boil one hour, or until tendei-. 
Add a little salt, lemon juice, and olive 
oil to taste. Pour otf water after having 
l)oiled ten minutes, then add fresh boil- 
ing water. Do not mix buttei- or ot her 
aninnd oils with spinage: it will, in inan\ 



instances, cause s<'\ei-e derangements of 
the stomach, and often (diolera morbus. 
Spinage is a valuable blood purifici", and 
should be eaten wliene\-el' desil"e(l. 

Stuffed Egg: Plant. Wash a good-sized 
v^^lX plant, put in kettle, cover with boil- 
ing wat( r. to whi(di has l)een added a 
little salt . and ))oil twenty minutes. Cut 
lengthwise into halves and carefully take 
out the insides, leaving wall three-fourths 
(»f an inch in thickness. Mix the i)ulp 
just i('mo\c(l with one-fourth cu]»ful 
ci"U'kei--dust, one-half cupful chopix'd or 
ground almonds, one tablespoonful olive 
oil, and a little salt. If the mixture is 
too dry. add a little milk. Fill the shells, 
heaping them uji. spiinkle over a small 
(plant ity cracker-dust, put in baking dish, 
set in brisk oven and bake until top is 
nicely browned, then serve. 

K'^'^ plants ma\ be cut in slices, soaked 
one hour in sti-ong salt-water, rolled in 
beaten ('<xi!; and cracker-dust, fi-icd in oil, 
then served. This vegetable has good 
food value and may be eaten at all times. 

Oyster Plant. — Aftei- sci-ai»ing. (-nt 
crosswise in thin slices; ])u\ in sutticient 
water to cover and stew until (piite ten- 
der. Add a little milk, olive oil and salt. 
.Ma\ be sei-ved with toast if desired. 

Potatoes should l>e si)aringly eaten; 
mu(di lietter not at all. They aiv un- 
healthful at Ix'st. If it is necessary to 
eat them, bake them in aii oven until 
well done. Fat the entire i)otato: do 
not discard the peeling, as it is next to 
this that the nuti-iment lays. The sweet 
])otato is the best variety. 

String: Beans. — String, snap and wash 
two (piarts lieans: Itoii in plenty of water 
for fifteen minutes; drain, then pour 
over again two (piarts boiling water. 
P>oil one and one-half hours. Add a lit- 
tle salt, two tablesi)oonfuls oil into which 
has l)een creamed two tablespoonfuls of 
Hour, and tine cupful sweet ci-eam. 

Tomatoes are saluable bir their acids 
which are ver.\ lieiielicial to the s\stem. 
They should lie stewed until well dcme, 
seeds strained mit. a little oil. salt and 
milk added: then boil a few minutes before 
serving. It is well to use them in soups. 

Turnips, if teiidei-. m;i\ be used occa- 
si<>iiall\. They are better in soups, as 
the nutriment contained is \cr\ low.
