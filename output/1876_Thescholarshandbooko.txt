PREFACE. 



The present work was written at the request of The 
School Board for London. It was designed to 
supply a want which has long been felt by practical 
teachers ; that of a scholars' handbook on the general 
principles on which the processes of Cookery and the 
sanitary management of a home depend. 

No work on the subject at present exists which 
can be advantageously placed in the hands of the 
pupils in ordinary schools. A mere collection of 
recipes, however valuable in themselves, does not 
constitute a book fit for use in schools, where the 
pupils should be instructed in the first principles 
adapted to all cases, and not have the memory 
burdened by details applicable only to each indivi- 
dual case. The " Manual of Domestic Economy," * 
published by the Author for the use of students in 
female Training Colleges, is adapted for the instruc- 
tion of teachers, by whom it ha-a Vi^^x^ N^s^'e^^^'^Ssi. 'ss^

much success that Her Majesty's Commissioners, 
appointed to Investigate the Education in Mining 
Districts, in their Report on the Industrial Schools 
founded by Messrs. Baird at the Iron Works at 
Gartsherrie, stated that " The girls, in three months, 
can be taught plain cooking, washing, and cleaning, 
enough to prepare them for service, or to make 
them useful to their mothers at home. They are 
all instructed in Tegetmeier*s 'Domestic Economy' 
at school, so that their minds have been directed 
to many useful principles. On going to service 
after such a course, a girl would probably get i/. 
more wages for the first half-year's service." 

The value of the present work has been greatly 
increased by an Appendix of upwards of 150 
recipes prepared for the use of those teachers of 
the National Training School of Cookery, South 
Kensington, who inaugurated the teaching of Cookery 
at the Cookery Centres, established by the School 
Board for London. For the permission to use 
these recipes the author has to express his sincere 
thanks.

CHAPTER L 
THE NATURE AND USES OF FOOD. 

1. Milk is almost the only example of a substance 
which is to be regarded as a naturally prepared food ; 
other articles of diet serve other purposes. Seeds 
grow, plants and animals live ; but milk is expressly 
formed for food, and for food alone. 

2. The young animal fed on milk grows or increases 
in weight daily. It forms or secretes several sub- 
stances, such as the saliva of the mouth, the bile of 
the liver, the tears from the eye, &c. ; it keeps itself 
warm, and exercises its strength in moving the limbs -^ 
all of which it is enabled to accoTK^\^ av^\s^ ^^ax^

food. 



14 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

For example, rice and potatoes consist chiefly of 
starch, and of themselves are bad foods unless com- 
bined with fatty and albumenoid matters; therefore 
we endeavour to use rice in puddings with milk, eggs, 
and butter, which supply all that is wanting, and it 
thus becomes a valuable article of food. Potatoes 
are most useful and economical if eaten with milk, 
fat meats ; alone they are barely able to support life 
and cannot sustain health and strength. Beans, 
which are chiefly albumenoid, are eaten with bacon. 
Bread, which is wanting in fat, with butter or bacon, 
&C. &c. 



CHAPTER IL 
MEAT: ITS COMPOSITION. 

9. Meat, or the flesh of animals used for food, 
consists of several very distinct substances, each of 
which possesses diflerent qualities. Some of these 
substances are hardened, others softened by heat; 
some dissolved, and others rendered tough by boiling 
water. It is therefore necessary to understand the 
nature of these diflferent substances, in order to per- 
form the different operations of cooking in the best 
and most economical manner. 

10. If we take sdme small shreds of lean meat 
and wash them repeatedly in clean water, rubbing 
them at the same time, we shall wash away all the 
soluble part, and at last there will remain nothing 
but some white threads which constitute the fibrous 
part of the flesh of the animal from which they were 
obtained. We could in this manner obtain about 
fifteen pounds from every hundred pounds of flesh. 
This substance of which these threads are cQxnL^<^<sftA. 

is termed fibrin ; it is an a\\>MmwicsA V^ ^aJosSSR. ^^^ ^ 
food. Fibrin also exists dVssoVj^di \tL ^^ >^^^^ ^ 



i6 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

living animals ; and when the fresh blood of a pig 
or other animal is stirred, as is done in making black 
puddings, the fibrin separates and adheres to the stick 
in long fibres. 

The action of heat on fibrin is very important. It 
is hardened and contracted by a heat as great as that 
of boiling water : this is easily shown by pouring some 
perfectly boiling water on the threads obtained by 
washing meat, or by cutting a thin shred of meat in 
the direction of the fibres, boiling it for a few minutes, 
and then noticing the alteration in its size and the 
hardening it has undergone. 

In water that is considerably less hot than boiling, 
the fibres of meat become soft, consequently any 
meat, even if old and tough, can be rendered useful 
for food by long continued stewing, at a heat pfiuqh 
less than that of boiling water. 

1 1. When meat is thoroughly washed to obtain the 
fibrin, a soluble substance, similar to the white of egg, 
passes away in the water ; this is termed albumen. 
There are from three to five pounds of albumen in 
every hundred of meat; it also forms a very large 
proportion of the brain and of the blood. In cold 
or warm water it is easily dissolved, but if heated to 
near the boiling point of water it becomes solid. If 
a piece of fresh meat is suddenly plunged for a few 
minutes into water quite boiling, the albumen at the 
outside is hardened and becoming solid prevents the 
escape of the juices which fonn the gravy. Exposed 
to a heat greater than that of boiling water albumen 
becomes very homy and indigestible, but when pro- 
perljr cooked it is one of the ipost valuable articles of 
diet 



cnA^. II.] MEAT: ITS COMPOSITION, 17 



I a. The tendinous or gristly parts of the flesh, such 
as cow's heel, the sinewy parts about the joints, also 
the skin and the nutritive parts of the bones, consist 
chiefly of a peculiar substance termed gelatin. This 
is a valuable albumenoid article of food when used 
with other substances. Gelatin and gelatinous articles 
of food may be dissolved by boiling, and the solution 
becomes a jelly when cold. Gelatin is rendered hard 
and homy by a dry heat, and therefore the sinewy 
and tendinous parts of meat are better adapted for 
stewing or boiling, than for roasting, broiling, or 
frying. 

13. If a quantity of lean meat be chopped up small, 
and placed in a closely-covered earthen pot, without 
water, and the pot be then put in a saucepan of water 
by the side of the fire so as to be very gradually heated, 
the juice of the flesh will escape. At first this will 
be of a red colour, being tinged with a little blood, 
but if heated to a greater degree it will become brown. 

The juice of the flesh contains many substances of 
the greatest value as food, and meat from which it is 
extracted is of very inferior value. 

All operations of cookery should be conducted so 
as to prevent as far as possible any loss of this 
valuable fluid. When meat is salted a large propor- 
tion of the juice of the flesh is extracted and forms 
the brine. This contains so much albumen as to 
become partly solid if heated. It is from the loss of 
this valuable juice that salted meats are so much less 
nutritious and wholesome than those that are used 
in a firesh state. What is termed extract of meat 
is merely the juice ot l\\^ft^^^lTCiTtL^\s\0cv*^^^^5:^:s^^^ 
has been evaporated so VJcvaX. \\.\^ w^-aiv^ %0v\^. 



i8 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

14. Almost all flesh used for food contains a con- 
siderable proportion of fat, which when eaten main- 
tains the warmth of the body. Hence we have a much 
greater appetite for fat in cold seasons and climates 
than in those that are warm. Fat is one of the olea- 
ginous foods (7) which are the source of the force 
we exert ; it is also essential to the proper action of 
the digestive organs. When taken in too great a 
quantity it accumulates in the body^ which thus be- 
comes fattened. 

15. The quantity and quality of these different 
substances vary very much in the different kinds of 
meat. The flesh of very young animals is not nearly 
so nutritious as that of those which are of mature age. 
Lamb and veal contain much less solid food than 
mutton or beef, and are consequently not so econo- 
mical, even if purchased at the same cost per pound. 
Mutton, if in good condition, is one of the most easily 
digested of the ordinary flesh meats. Pork is not so 
easily digested as beef or mutton, consequently is 
unfitted for sick persons, and from the unwholesome 
manner in which pigs are often kept, is more subject 
to be diseased than the flesh of sheep or oxen. 

16. Some of the internal parts of animals are ex- 
ceedingly useful as food. The stomach of the ox 
when cleaned and partially boiled is sold as tripe, an 
easily digestible and nutritious food. In the tongue 
the fibres of the flesh are very small and delicate, 
and if stewed slowly, become very soft and digestible ; 
but tongues are frequently much hardened by salting 
for a long time. The flesh of the heart of the ox and 

o/" the sheep is very firm and solid, and though nutri- 
^oi/s^ IS not very easily digested. Kidney and \v\«^

except in the case of those of young animals, are also 
hard and firm when cooked, and are not very digest- 
ible. The brain consists chiefly of albumen and water, 
and if properly prepared is a useful food. The blood 
of the pig contains a very large proportion of nutri- 
tive food, but is not a favourite food, and except in 
the form of " black puddings," is rarely used in this 
country. 



CHAPTER III. 
MEAT : THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY. 

17. Roasting is a mode of cooking meat that is 
more common in this than in any other country. It 
is, however, not an economical or advantageous mode 
of cooking small joints, as they become dried up ; and 
it is exceedingly wasteful in the case of sinewy or 
tendinous pieces of meat, as it renders a very large 
proportion of them quite uneatable. Roasting is an 
advantageous mode of cooking only in cases where 
the joints are large and where the cost of a large fire 
is not of importance. Consequently it is not the best 
suited to the circumstances of the working classes. 

When a piece of meat is hung before a fire, part of 
the fat melts and forms the dripping which should be 
carefully and cleanly preserved, as it constitutes a 
valuable article of food. During the process some of 
the water of the juice of the flesh is dried up ; from 
these two causes the meat loses in weight. In some fat 
joints more than one quarter of the weight is lost, in 
others much less, as in the case of a leg of mutton* 
fvhfch is covered by a skin, and has bwl \\\X\^ i^ to 



CH. III.] MEAT: THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY. 21 

To roast well the meat should be hung up before a 
brisk bright fire, the first effect of which is to harden 
the albumen in the outer parts and thus prevent the 
escape of the nutritious juices. The heat should then 
be continued until it has penetrated the inside. When 
it is heated the natural red colour of the flesh is 
changed, and from the hardening of the albumen the 
meat becomes firm and can be cut in thin slices. 

Underdone meat is not, as is generally supposed, 
more nutritious than that which is properly cooked. 

The heat of the fire causes the production of pecu- 
liar flavours and odours which distinguish one kind of 
meat from another. 

18. In roasting it is important that the meat be put 
down before a bright, clear fire, sufficiently large to. 
heat the whole of the joint at once. If possible, 
skewers and spits should not be thrust into the meatj^ 
as they make holes through which the gravy escapes. 
The time usually allowed for roasting is a quarter of 
an hour or twenty-minutes for every pound, but this 
depends on the thickness and also on the size of the 
joint. 

The usual plan of making gravy for roast meat is, 
to sprinkle a little salt on the joint after it is placed hi 
the dish, and then pour some boiling water over it ; this 
washes off* some of the brown and makes a coloured 
liquid in the dish. 

A much better plan is to collect the dripping in a 
flat pan, and when the meat is dished to leave as much 
as may be required for making the gravy ; and then to 
dredge in some flour and place tVve ^^xs.^^^^x'^^^s^^ 
or stove until the flour is bio^wiied. K\\X.^^ c*;^^'^^

flour so as to avoid leaving any lumps. Boiling water, 
or still better, broth made by stewing any scraps of 
bones from the joint, is then poured on in sufficient 
quantity, the whole being constantly stirred ; the whole 
is allowed to boil for a few minutes and poured 
over the joint. In this manner a large quantity of 
very good, rich, nutritious gravy is produced which 
is very economical, as it renders potatoes and other 
vegetables much more acceptable, especially to child- 
ren, and in this mode saves the consumption of meat. 

If a joint is to be eaten cold it is better that it 
should not be cut whilst warm, as the contraction of 
the fibres forces out the gravy; but if not cut until cold 
the gravy is retained and the meat is much more tasty 
and tender. 

19. Baking is a more economical mode of cook- 
ing than roasting, especially in small families where 
economical stoves or ranges with side ovens are used. 
In baking there is less loss of weight than in roasting 
as the joint is less dried. Care should be taken that 
the floor of the oven is not too much heated or the 
fat may be burnt, which causes a bad flavour. A great 
advantage in baking is that it requires less attention 
than roasting, and that potatoes, or a batter or York- 
shire pudding, can be cooked under the meat. This 
latter may be made by taking four tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and rubbing them into a smooth batter with a 
pint of milk, which has previously had a well-beaten 
egg mixed with it. If eggs are abundant two or three 
may be employed with advantage, the quantity of 
Bout being lessened. The milk and egg must be 
added gradually, the batter being rubbed uxi^ Mm- 
^'^^j^ smooth after each addition. 



CH. III.] M£AT: THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY, 23 

20. Broiling is the rapid cooking of a small 
piece of meat, as a chop or a steak, by exposing it to 
the heat of a fire ; in large kitchens the gridiron on 
which the meat is cooked is usually placed over a 
large, clear fire, but in smaller houses it is generally 
hung up before the fire. Broiling has very nearly the 
same effect on meat as roasting. The albumen of the 
outer portions is hardened, and forms a kind of skin 
retaining the juices. 

In order that this may be done most perfectly, the 
meat should be rapidly turned so as to prevent the 
juices escaping on the side furthest from the fire. 
A fork should not be thrust into the flesh, as it makes 
holes through which the juices escape. 

In large chop-houses, the chops are turned over very 
quickly with broiling-tongs. 

Broiling is a good mode of cooking thick fleshy 
chops and steaks, but is a wasteful method of pre- 
paring thin pieces such as are often purchased when 
cheap meat is required. 

Success in broiling depends on having a thick, fleshy 
piece of tender meat, a clear fire, a clean gridiron, and 
on the meat being turned repeatedly. Broiled meat 
should not be sprinkled with salt until after it is 
cooked, and it should never be cut into in order to 
ascertain whether it is done; as if again put down 
to the fire the juice escapes from the cut, and the 
meat becomes dry and much less nutritious. 

21. Frying is the cooking of meat in melted fat 
heated in a frying or stew-pan over a fire or stoM^.

its fibrin hardened and contracted, ao that it becomes 
very tough ; therefore fried meat is usually regarded as. 
inferior to such as is broiled. 

If, however, the fat is not over-heated, and there 
is sufficient to prevent burning, and to cover the. 
piece to be cooked, meat may be fried of a very, light 
brown colour without being hardened. 

22. Boiling may be performed in various modes. 
If the joint is put in cold water and placed on the 
fire, and the heat very slowly raised to the boiling- 
point, after which the saucepan is pulled back from, 
the fire so as to be kept hot without boiling until the 
joint is thoroughly done ; the meat will be tender in 
proportion to the length of time and slowness with 
which it has been cooked, but a considerable propor- 
tion of the gelatin and albumen will be dissolved in. 
the water, and unless this be used for soup or broth 
will be wasted. 

This dissolved albumen coagulates or hardens as 
the water approaches the boiling-point, and forms the 
scum, which should be removed by skimming just 
before the water boils, or it is carried down by the- 
boiling and discolours the meat. 

A different mode of boiling is sometimes adopted, 
when the liquor is not required for soup. It is to 
place the joint in perfectly boiling water for a quarter 
of an hour ; this hardens the outside and prevents the 
escape of the nutritious juices ; the water is then 
cooled, either by adding a quantity of cold water or 
by drawing the vessel back from the fire, and the 
process continued at a low heat until the whole is 
t/joroughly cooked. 
J^f the water is made to boil during t\ie wV\o\^ \\tafc 



CH. III.] MEAT: THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY, 25 

the meat is being looked, the ifibrin is rendered hard, 
and the meat becomes tough and stringy. 

To have meat tender it is important not to expose 
it to the heat of boiling water for any length of time. 
In what is termed a Norwegian kitchener the water 
in which the tneat is placed is made to boil. Then 
the vessel is placed in a box thickly lined with 
layets of woollen felt ; this prevents the escape of the 
heat, and the lai^est joints will be perfectly and most 
tenderly cooked after having been taken away from 
the fire for three or four hours. 

In all cases of boiling it is desirable to avoid 
thrusting a large fork or skewers into the joint, as 
these, by passing into the interior where the albumen 
is not hardened, make holes through which the juice 
escapes, and the meat becomtes dry and less nutritious. 
If necessary, it is better to tie the joint round with 
'[String than to employ skewers. 

Ham and the lean of bacon, which is usually hard 
and tough, may be cooked so as to be perfectly tender 
and without waste of fat, by not allowing the water to 
boil. At the large ham and beef shops in London, 
whete the meat is always very tender, the hams are 
placed in large coppers of cold water, a small fire is 
lighted under the coppfer, and the water gradually 
raised to thie boiling-point, '^hen the fire is imme- 
diately rakied out, the copper covered over, and the 
hams allowed to remain in the water until it is nearly 
cold. In this manner they are several hours in cook- 
ing, and are never heated to the boiling-point, conse- 
quently the flesh becomes eT.c^«Kc^^ \.«>>^^^ >«&^

economical mode of cooking than boiling : by its use 
the flesh of old animals, and tough, sinewy joints that 
would otherwise be wasted, can be used for food. 
Stewing consists in cooking meat in a small quantity 
of liquid, by a very moderate heat, which is continued 
for a very considerable time. By this long-continued 
action of a gentle heat the fibres are softened and the 
toughest joints become tender and eatable. In cook- 
ing meat by stewing it must be remembered that 
length of time is much more important than extra 
heat; and that the cooking of the food cannot be 
hastened by increasing the heat, which if raised to the 
boiling-point only hardens the fibres and renders the 
meat tough. • 

In the houses of the working classes in England 
stewing is not so much employed as it should be. 
By its use small pieces of meat may be cooked with 
vegetables, and made into the most savoury and 
nourishing dishes, and the coarsest and cheapest 
joints may be made almost equal in flavour and quite 
as nutritious as the dearest. 

The stews best known in this country are stewed 
steak, haricot mutton, Irish stew, and jugged hare. 
The value of these is recognized, and it is only 
prejudice or ignorance which prevents the English 
housewife applying the same mode of cooking to 
other joints, and using the French plan of always 
having a stewing pipkin or pot-au-feu by the side of 
the fire.

ordinary saucepan, put in a little butter or dripping, 
and melt it; then place in the steak, cut into conve- 
niently sized pieces, and fry each of a very light brown, 
frying a sliced onion at the same time; when suffi- 
ciently fried, add the seasoning, such as pepper and salt 
The salt must not be added at first, as it would draw 
out the gravy and prevent the meat browning. The 
meat should then be barely covered with cold water 
and allowed to stew slowly for four or five hours, 
the greatest care being taken that it does not boil. 

The vegetables, such as turnip, carrot, celery, &c., 
should be cut up and boiled in a separate saucepan 
of water until tender, and them added to the stewed 
meat The object of cooking the vegetables separately 
is to prevent the necessity of boiHng the meat, which 
would harden it Half an hour before serving, add a 
little flour and water, mixed into a very thin paste, and 
let the stew just simmer so as to thicken the gravy. 

Haricot Mutton is made in precisely the same 
manner, using small cutlets from the neck of mutton 
instead of steak. 

Irish Stew is a popular dish ; it is usually made 
by placing in a stew-pan alternate layers of pieces of 
mutton and sliced potatoes and onions, with pepper 
and salt, barely covering them with water, and allow- 
ing the whole to stew for some hours. If a large 
quantity of potatoes are required, it is desirable to 
partially boil some small ones and place them on the 
top of the stew half an hour or more before serving, 
as they then become perfectly cooked and^^cio^'i^'^^

utility of stewing. If a hare is too old and tough to 
be eaten when roasted, it is cut up and placed in an 
earthenware vessel with a little bacon, onions, cloves, 
lemon peel, sweet herbs, pepper and salt, and 
a little water ; the earthen jar is then to be very 
closely covered over and placed in a large sauce- 
pan of cold water, taking care the water is not 
efficiently high to run into the jar. The saucepan 
is allowed to boil for four hours, or the jar may be 
placed in a very slow oven. Before serving, the 
gravy is thickened by adding a little flour and water. 

Stewed Rabbits. — A very economical and useful 
mode of cooking rabbits is used in Spain. Alternate 
layers of pieces of rabbits and sliced onions are 
-placed with a little seasoning and flour in a stew-pan 
•without any water, the whole is closely covered down, 
and placed by the side of the fire for three or four 
hours. 

Vinegar is sometimes used in the preparation of 
stews, as directed in the following recipe, which, if 
strictly followed, produces a most excellent dish : — 

" Take shin or leg of beef, cut it into slices or 
pieces of t\vo or three ounces each ; dip it in good 
vinegar, and with or without onions, or any other 
flavouring or vegetable substances, put it in a stew- 
pan, and without water, let it stand on a stew-hearth, 
t)r by a slow fire for four or six hours, when it will 
be thoroughly done, will have yielded plenty of gravy, 
and be perfectly tender. Great care must be taken 
t&at the heat is sufficiently moderate. Leg or shin

or fish may be so dressed. A pound and a half of 
leg of beef, without bone, so dressed, and plenty of 
potatoes, will dine four people luxuriously." 

25. The Stewing Pipkift or Fot-au-feu is the 
■general mode of cooking amongst the working classes 
in France. Its use effects a great saving of fuel, 
trouble, and skill. Car^me, one of the most celebrated 
French cooks, gives the following directions :— 

**The good housewife puts her meat into an 
earthen pot, and pours cold water on it, in the pro- 
portion of two quarts to three pounds of the beef. 
She sets it at the side of the fire. 

" The pot grows gradually hot, and as the water heats 
it dilates the muscular fibres of the flesh by dissolving 
the gelatinous matter which covers them, and allows 
the albumen to detach itself easily, and rise to the 
surface of the water in light foam or scum, while the 
savoury juice of the meat, dissolving little by little, 
adds flavour to the broth. 

" By this simple proceeding of slow cooking, the 
housewife obtains a savoury and nourishing broth, 
and tender boiled meat, and with a good flavour. But 
by placing ^he pot-au-feu on too hot a fire, it boils too 
soon ; the albumen coagulates and the fibre hardens ; 
the sad result is that you have only a hard piece of 
boiled meat, and a broth without flavour or goodness. 
A little fresh water poured into the pot at intervals 
helps the scum to rise more abundantly." 

Whatever vegetables are in season may be added to 
the stewing-pot, as celery, onions, carrots^ torw^^j^j^i^^^^ 
salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. TV^ XstcJOa. '^''^^^y^

30 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY, 

The great precaution to be taken in stewing is not 
to allow the heat to rise too high. This is quite pre- 

I vented in Captain Warren's cooking-pots. These 
consist of one saucepan within another, like a car- 
penter's glue-pot, the outer being filled with water. 
By this arrangement the inner cannot become over- 
heated to the boiling point ; consequently the meat 
is cooked slowly and without becoming hard. In 
Warren's cooking-pots, meat, fowls, ham, bacon, &c., 
can all be cooked perfectly without any water 
being placed in the inner vessel, so that the whole of- 
the gravy flowing from the meat is preserved in the 
richest form. 

26. Soups and Broths are not so generally 
used among the working classes in this country as is 
desirable. They furnish, when properly prepared, 
very economical and nutritive articles of food. 

Pea Soup is that which is most generally used in 
England. It may be prepared either with or without 
meat; the latter is hardly required, except for the 
flavour, as the peas are remarkably rich in albumenoid 
substances. The following directions may be fol- 
lowed. Soak a quart of split peas over night, place 
them in a stewpan with half a pound of lean bacon, 
or some bones from roast meat broken small, and 
three quarts of cold water, or the liquor in which 
some fresh meat has been boiled ; place on a very 
slow fire and add celery, onions, and sweet herbs, and 
simmer for two or three hours until the peas and 
vegetables are sufliciently soft to pass through a 
colander^ when pepper and salt should be added and 
the whole reheated^ and eaten with toasted bread cut 

^^to small square pieces. If no meat can be obXaAxv^^ 



CH. m.]MEAT: THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY, 31 

the soup may be rendered much more savoury by 
frying the onions and celery in a little dripping before 
adding them to the soup ; and if dripping is plentiful, 
the bread may be fried instead of toasted. 

Scotch Broth is very generally used among the 
middle and working classes in Scotland It is very 
economical, as both broth and meat are used. The 
following are the directions : Put into a pot three 
quarts of cold water, along with a cupful of Scotch 
barley, and let it boil. Add two pounds of neck of 
mutton. Allow it to stew gently for an hour, skim- 
ming occasionally. Then add turnips cut fti squares, 
and onions sliced, and carrots and turnips uncut. The 
half of a small cabbage chopped in moderately sized 
pieces may be put in instead of all these vegetables, 
and leeks may be used instead of onions. Stew the 
whole for an hour longer. The broth is now ready. 
Season with salt, and serve in a tureen. The meat 
is served in a separate dish, with the uncut pieces of 
turnip and carrot, and a little of the broth as gravy. 
Any meat may be employed in the same way, which 
is not unhke that followed in preparing the French 
Pot au feu (25). 

27. Salting Meat is in most cases a very waste- 
ful process ; salt when applied to fresh meat extracts 
a very large proportion of the nutritious juice of the 
flesh, and at the same time hardens the fibres and 
renders them much less easily digestible. The brine 
that runs from salted meat contains so much nutri- 
tious albumen that it becomes nearly solid on being, 
heated, and as there is no meaxv^ cA ^-xict-asiQax^ *^^

prejudice which is not followed in ahy other country, 
nor is there any good reason why beef and pork should 
be salted before boiling, and mutton and veal boiled 
without salting. The plan followed on the Continent 
of slowly stewing a joint of beef without first salting 
it, yields a much more nutritious, tender, and well 
flavoured food. 

In cases where it is necessary to preserve meat, as 
on shipboard, salting may be useful, but health can- 
not be preserved for any length of time on meat from 
V^rhich the most valuable part, the nutritious juice, 
has been extracted by salting. 

In the case of very fat meats, as bacon, salting is 
not objectionable, as in them the most valuable con- 
stituent is the fat, which is not injured by the process. 

In the case of ham a peculiar flavour is produced 
during the process of salting which is highly esteemed, 
but it should be remembered that the value of the 
flesh of ham as food is very much less than that of 
the meat from which it is produced. 

28. Preserved Meats. — The meats imported in 
tins from Australia and South America are exceed- 
ingly valuable articles of diet ; and are at the present 
time much cheaper than firesh butcher's meat The 
only drawback to their value is that they are rather 
overcooked in the process for preparing them, it is 
'therefore more advantageous to use them cold than in 
any othfer manner. 

39. Extract of Meat. — The extracts of meat sold 

in small jars are merely the juice of the flesh eva- 

pbrated till it becomes nearly dry. It is useful as 

means of making beef tea, or soup qu\ck\Y,\3wX\s Vs.^ 

^^ ^^ans an economical article of food. 



CH.III.] MEAT: THE PROCESSES OF COOKERY. 33 

Beef-tea, which is so valuable in cases of illness, 
is usually made by boiling the meat in water ; this is a 
very bad plan, as the fibres are hardened, and the 
soluble portions less readily extracted. It should be 
made by pouring a pint of cold water on half-a-pound 
of finely-cut or chopped lean beef, and then placing it, 
in a covered earthenware vessel, by the side of the fire 
for an hour or two. By this means the whole of the 
soluble nutritious portions are extracted and the 
insoluble fibre alone remains. A small quantity of 
salt and two or three cloves greatly improve the 
flavour. 



CHAPTER IV, 

FISH : ITS VALUE AS FOOD, AND COOKERY, 

30. Fish although of great importance as yielding 
a cheap supply of nutritious and easily digested animal 
food, is not equal in value to the same weight of meat, 
as it contains a much larger proportion of water and 
leiSs solid material. 

Fish usually contain a very considerable proportion 
of oil, in some kinds, as herrings, sprats, pilchards, 
salmon, eels, mackerel, this is found in all parts of 
the body, whilst in others, which are usually termed 
white fish, the oil is contained in the liver, and the 
rest of the body is almost entirely free fi'om it Such 
is the case in cod, haddock, whiting, soles, plaice, 
flounders, &c. 

The fibre of the flesh of fish is very digestible, and 
the juice though more watery than that of meat is of 
considerable nutritive value. When boiled, a large 
proportion of this escapes into the water and is lost ; 
hence though so frequently practised, boiling is not 
the most economical or advantageous moda o£ cooking 



CHAP. iv.J FISH: ITS VALUE AS FOOD, 3| 

31. Salting, though often necessary to preserve 
fish when caught in large quantities, is not a desirable 
mode of preparing white fish. It extracts a very large 
proportion of the nourishment and hardens the fibrin ; 
and if the salt has to be extracted by soaking in water 
before cooking, as in the case of salt cod, very littie 
nourishment remains. The fat of the oily fish, as 
herrings, &c., is not removed by salting ; hence they are 
very valuable as food when preserved in this manner. 

32. The most advantageous modes of cooking fish 
are those that retain the whole of the nutritious por- 
tions. A plaice or a sole placed on a buttered dish 
covered over with a few bread-crumbs and seasoning 
and baked retains the whole of the nutriment, and 
furnishes a much more savoury meal than if boiled. 

The following recipes give directions for the econo- 
mical and advantageous cooking of fish. 

Baked Fish. — ^Almost any kind of fish, as 
mackerel, haddock, whiting, soles &c. may be cooked 
by being placed in a dish with bread crumbs, a little 
chopped parsley, and other seasoning, as pepper, salt, 
a few sliced onions, if desired, and baked in a side oven. 
The mcH'e oily fish, as herrings, pilchards, sprats, may 
be packed closed in a deep earthenwiare dish, seasoned 
with pepper and salt, covered with vinegar and cooked 
perfectly even by the side of the fire. Fish prepared 
in either of these modes, are very good to eat cold, and 
as they will keep good for scnne days furnish very 
usefiil and cheap articles of food. Broiling fish is an 
excellent mode of cooking them, there is no loss of 
nourishment and the flavour is much better t}sa3&. 
when they are boiled. A.\iio^<&diTCL'acO«Lsx^^^^'»'^'^

%i^ HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 



cooked by boiling, and no sauce is required to be 
prepared. 

Frying is a useful mode of preparing fish, especially 
soles, whitings, plaice, cod, and other white fish. 
The chief precautions are to dry them thoroughly, 
either to flour or dip them in a thin batter made of 
flour and water, and fry in a deep pan with sufficient 
fat or dripping to cover them if possible, and to take 
care that the heat is not so great as to bum the fish, 
which should be of a light brown colour. 

Fish soups are largely used in some countries. In 
the Channel Islands a very good and nutritious soup 
is made of conger-eel according to the following 
directions : — 

Cut up a moderate sized conger-eel in a stewpan 
with three or four quarts of water, and let it simmer 
two or three hours till it breaks to pieces. Rub it 
through a sieve, and pour back into the stewpan with 
a little butter. Throw in a small leek, the white heart 
of a cabbage cut up, some parsley chopped small, and a 
bunch of thyme. Mix two table-spoonfuls of flour in 
a pint of milk, and when the cabbage is done, throw 
it into the stewpan, stirring all the time, till it comes 
to a boil ; then let it boil ten minutes to take ofl* the 
rawness of the flour. Before dishing up, season with 
a little salt, as the salt is apt to curdle the milk if 
added before. Have ready thin slices of bread in 
your tureen, and pour the soup oven 



CHAPTER V. 

EGGS: THEIR COMPOSITION, VALUE AS 
FOOD, AND COOKERY. 

33- Eggs contain two distinct substances, the 
white and the yolk. The solid part of the white is 
almost entirely albumen which forms fifteen parts out 
of every loo, the remaining eighty-five parts being 
water. Albumen is a valuable flesh-forming food and 
gives its name, albumenoidy or albumen-like, to the 
class of foods to which it belongs. It possesses 
peculiar properties, it dissolves in cold or warm water, 
but in the white of egg it is in layers like those of an 
onion, and these requu*e to be brgken up by beating 
before the albumen can be dissolved. 

If the beating is long continued a glairy fluid is 
formed in which large quantities of air are contained 
in bubbles; when used in pastry in this state eggs add 
very much to the lightness or sponginess of the mass. 

Heated to a point many degrees below that of boil- 
ing water the albumen hardens, becoming solid and 
of an opaque white, hence \\s i^axcka Ixwsi ^^ x^asbsv 
word, albusy white. ^ ^i^ .

the paste more tenacious and so retaining the gases 
and vapour that by expanding make the paste light 
in the process of cooking. 

The preparations sold under the name of egg-pow- 
ders consist merely of chemical substances that give 
out a gas when moistened They help to render the 
dough light, but have no nutritive value whatever. 

36. Preserving Eggs. — As eggs are produced in 
large numbers in spring and summer, it is desirable to 
preserve them for winter use. 1 hey may be kept good 
for many weeks by closing the pores of the shells, by 
rubbing them with a little melted lard as soon as they 
are laid, or they may be packed in a vessel and a mix- 
ture of freshly-slaked lime in water, mixed to the 
thickness of thin cream, poured over them. This 
method will keep them, if fresh when laid down, for 
many months, but it unfortunately renders the shells 
very britde. 

37. From the great value of eggs many persons are 
tempted to keep fowls in a confined space ; but this 
plan cannot be recommended, as after a few weeks the 
ground becomes tainted, the hens become diseased, 
and cease to lay. But a few hens can always be kept to 
great profit on the waste house scraps and a little com, 
provided they have a free range and can obtain a supply 
of worms and insects. 



CHAPTER VI. 

MILK: ITS CONSTITUENTS AND PRODUCTS-^ 
BUTTER AND CHEESE. 

38. Milky as it is obtained fresh from the cow, 
is a white flaid, having a slight smell and taste. It 
consists of several distinct substances, which partly 
separate from one another on its being allowed to 
remain at rest. These are Cream, Curd, and 
Whey, the last consisting of water, which contains 
dissolved in it the Sugar of Milk, and the saline 
and earthy minerals necessary to supply the saline 
materials of the blood, and those required for the 
growth of the bones. 

39. The Cream is formed of very small globules 
of butter, invisible to the naked eye, but readily seen 
with the aid of a microscope ; each of these globules 
is surrounded by a very fine skin of curd. They are 
dispersed in the milk when it is first drawn from the 
cow, but as they are lighter than the whey, they slowly 
rise to the top when the milk is a.l\.css«^"^ \si ^^'^^ 
and form the cream. Tb\s toyci^ \aJ«jes. ^^gss^R.^ '^^^s

very shallow pans than if it is in vessels several 
inches in depth. The quantity of cream varies con- 
siderably ; some cows give milk much richer in cream 
than others. The quality of the food on which they 
are fed also aflfects the quantity of the cream. Cows 
feeding in rich pastures give richer milk than those 
that graze on poor land; and if they are fed upon 
oil-cake, &c., the amount is greatly increased. The 
quantity of cream is usually about lo per cent., but 
is much lessened if the cows are driven a long dis- 
tance daily, and also by exposure to cold weather ; 
in the first case the cream is consumed in producing 
the force the animal exercises in walking, and in 
the second by generating the heat necessary to resist 
the cold (4). 

40. Clotted Cream. — The rising of the creatn 
can be hastened by heat, which causes it to separate 
in a much more solid form, when it is called clotted 
cream. 

The milk, after standing ten or twelve hours in aflat 
metal milk-pan, is placed, without disturbing the cream 
that has risen, over a stove or clear fire, until a thick 
scum or cake rises to the surface \ a small portion of 
this is gently removed with the finger from time to time^ 
and when a few small air-bubbles are seen underneath, 
the whole is immediately removed from the fire, and 
allowed to stand twenty-four hours. The cream thus 
obtained is much more solid than usual ; it can be 
gathered off the milk with the fingers, and butter id 
easily made from it by stirring for a few mintites with 
the hand This cream, which is called sAlded or 
clotted cream, will keep several days wil\vo«Jk toirning 
^^^''^' It, however, requires to be careWftj TSit.^\ 



CH. VI.] MILK: ITS CONSTITUENTS, ^c. 43 

for if the milk is allowed to remain on the fire after 
the bubbles appear beneath the cake of cream the 
process fails. 

The plan of scalding the cream is very useful in 
small dairies, where only one or two cows are kept, 
as the cream keeps much longer without becoming 
sour, and may be kept until a sufficient quantity is 
collected to make it into butter. 

41. Skimmed Milk. — The milk remaining after 
the cream has been removed is termed skimmed 
milk. If used before it becomes sour it is of great 
value as food; where new milk* cannot be obtained, 
its use is of very great importance j for puddings it is 
almost equal to fresh milk, as the place of the cream 
that has been removed can be supplied by adding half 
an ounce of suet or dripping to every pint of milk. 
When fresh milk cannot be obtained for children, the 
use of good skimmed milk is of the greatest benefit 
It is sometimes the case that the skimmed milk 
has been so long kept, that, although not sour, it 
will curdle when heated. This may be prevented by 
adding a pinch of common carbonate of soda to it 
before boiling ; and in the same manner unskimmed 
milk that is " on the turn '* may be boiled for bread 
and milk or puddings, without curdling, by the use 
of a very small quantity of carbonate of soda. 

42. The Curd which is dissolved both in milk and 
in skimmed milk separates in a solid form as they 
become sour. The quantity of curd, like that of the 
cream, varies considerably in different samples of 
milk. The curd when separated ixwst Nissfc \sS5»^Xs^

but and dried, forms cheese, which varies very much 
in quality and in its value as food. Cheese made 
from fresh milk contains nearly the whole of the 
cream, and is more digestible and useful as food 
than that which is made from skimmed milk, which 
is very hard and digested with difficulty, although it 
contains a great amount of albumenoid substances. 
In all situations in which milk can be obtained, it 
is far preferable to use it as food in a fresh state 
than to employ the cheese obtained from it. The 
whey which remains after the separation of the curd 
contains the sugar of milk and the mineral ingre- 
dients. Where neither fresh nor skimmed milk can 
be procured, whey is a useful article of food. 

43. Butter is obtained from cream by the operation 
of churning; during this the thin skin of curd sur- 
rounding each globule of butter is broken, and the 
butter unites into a solid mass. Sometimes the 
butter refuses to " come ; " this usually arises from 
the temperature being either too high or too low. 
Butter can be obtained most readily from either milk 
or cream at a temperature of 60^ Fahrenheit, and 
cold or warm water should be added to the cream or 
milk, so as to obtain that degree of heat. When 
churned, the butter should be well washed, so as to 
remove every trace of curd, which, if left, soon 
putrefies and renders it rancid, and then salted. 

Butter may be made from scalded or clotted 
cream by stirring briskly with the hand for a few 
minutes. 

Butter \s an expensive article of food, and its 
value IS no greater than that of any oftvw ^o^ 1«X, 
such as dripping, lard, or the melted fat ^i %ocA 



CH. VI.] MILK: ITS CONSTITUENTS, 6^c, 45 

bacon. Hence, where economy is an object, these 
may be advantageously substituted for it. 

44. The use of milk for food is not sufficiently 
valued in this country. Young children can hardly 
be reared in health without it. When first swallowed 
it is made into a soft curd by the acids of the 
stomach, and in this state is readily digested. In 
dairy countries skimmed milk should be largely used 
by those children whose parents are unable to obtain 
fresh milk, as it is, if not sour, the cheapest form in 
which animal food can be obtained. 

45. Milk is seldom adulterated with anything 
except water, which may be detected with 
sufficient accuracy by means of two instru- 
ments termed milk-testers. The most useful 
of these consists of a long tube, containing 
100 parts of milk; this is numbered from 
the top downwards. When filled with milk to 
the upper line, and allowed to stand twenty- 
four hours, the number of parts of cream 
that have risen to the surface may be seen, 
and the richness of the milk ascertained. 

From the height of the glass tube all the cream 
does not rise, so that the milk appears poorer than it 
really is. 

In some of the large Union houses the milk is paid 
for according to the quantity of cream it contains, 
10 parts in 100 being regarded as a fair quantity, and 
a larger amount being paid for at a greater rate, and 
a less amount at a smaller.

lactometer floats higher in the heavier pure milk than 
it does if it is diluted with water. But this method 
of testing is not so good as that first described, as 
the milk is rendered heavier and apparently better by 
the removal of the cream. 

46. Preserved Milk is now largely used in cities, 
on shipboard, and in situations where fresh milk 
is not to be readily obtained. It is made by eva- 
porating nearly the whole of the water of the milk, 
and adding sugar. If well prepared it is perfectly 
wholesome,, and is very valuable as an article of diet 
where fresh milk cannot be obtained. 






CHAPTER Vir. 

FLOUR: ITS CONSTITUENTS, STARCH, 
SUGAR-BREAD-MAKING— PASTRY, &c. 

47. Flour, — ^The flour of wheat is that usually 
•mployed for making bread in this country. Wheaten 
flour, like all valuable foods, consists of several dis« 
tinct substances. These may be separated from each 
other very readily. 

If a little dough, made of moistened flour, is tied 
up in a piece of muslin, and kneaded for some time 
between the fingers in a large basin of water, the 
latter becomes milky from the starch of the flour 
being washed out into it. If this water is allowed to 
stand at rest, the starch settles at the bottom in the 
form of a fine white powder. The water contains 
dissolved in it a small quantity of sugar, giun, and 
the other soluble substances of the floiu*. 

When the whole of the starch has been washed 
through the muslin, a greyish tough substance, like 
very soft indiarubber remains. This is gluten, which 
forms about 10 per cent, of the flour, the starch being 
nearly 70 per cent, and the sugar and gum 7 per cent, 
the remaining parts being made 11^ oC '^^^^xsfijBssis^ 
substances, and indige^^b\t i&yt^. 



^% HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

48. Starch is one of the most important of all 
vegetable foods. It does not contain any albumenoid 
substances and cannot therefore supply the materials 
of which our bodies are formed ; taken by itself, it 
would not long support life, nor enable a young 
animal to grow ; but it is the source of the warmth 
of our bodies and of the strength we exert, in this 
respect resembling fat and the other oleaginous foods 
with which it is classed. 

As obtained in a pure state, it consists of very 
minute grains, each covered with an outer skin which 
is perfectly insoluble in and unchanged by water; 
hence pure starch is unaffected by moisture, and may 
be washed without change. 

In boiling water these grains crack, and the interior 
of each dissolves in the water, forming a thick, gummy 
solution. A similar change takes place if starch is 
baked, when it becomes soluble and forms what is 
called British Gum, which is used in stififening muslins 
and cementing postage stamps, &c. Several nearly 
pure starches are largely used as food. Tapioca is 
a very pure starch, which is slightly heated during its 
preparation, and rendered partially soluble in cold 
water. 

Sago is a starch obtained from the interior of 
the stem of a palm tree. It also is heated in its 
preparation. 

Arrowroot is a very pure starch, obtamed in the 

form of a white powder. Potatoestarch may be 

easily prepared by grating well washed large potatoes 

into water and allowing time for the starch to settle 

St the bottom, when the water with the veg^laHe ^bre 

foar be poured away, fresih water bemg aM^^, «si^ 



CH. VII.] FLOUR: ITS CONSTITUENTS, 6r»c, 49 

the starch washed repeatedly until the water can be 
poured off perfectly clear, when the starch may be 
dried on cloths and is ready for use. 

Prepared in this manner, potato-starch may be used 
in the place of arrowroot, for which it is often sold, 
as food it is not at all inferior in value. 

The preparations sold under the names of Corn- 
flour and Maizena are pure starches obtained from 
maize or Indian com by the removal of all the 
albumenoid and other substances. Their value as 
food is precisely the same as that of arrowroot or other 
starchy articles, and, like them, when combined with 
milk and eggs, they form very advantageous articles 
of diet. 

All starches are useless for food, if taken alone. 
To render them valuable they require the addition of 
albumenoid and fatty substances. These may be fur- 
nished by the addition of milk. By placing about two 
ounces of tapioca, rice, or sago in the bottom of a 
baking-dish, with a little sugar and butter, or dripping, 
pouring over a quart of cold milk and baking for 
about an hour in a slow oven, a very economical and 
valuable pudding results. 

49. Starch, in its uncooked insoluble state, is not 
capable of digestion by the human stomach j hence 
all uncooked starchy articles should be avoided. 
Seeds and fruits which consist chiefly of starch, espe- 
cially if it is combined with oil, as is the case in 
almonds, hazel and other nuts, are remarkably difficult 
of digestion.

mastication, consequently, it is of great importance to 
cause children to eat all starchy articles, as potatoes, 
bread, rice, &c. slowly, and to masticate theip 
thoroughly. It is of much greater consequence to 
chew potatoes and bread well than meat; but all 
substances are more easily digested if eaten slowly. 

50. Sugar in its value as food closely resembles 
starch, but being soluble and more readily digested, 
is especially fitted for children, by whom it is 
greatly relished. It is unfortunately not so econo- 
mical as starch, and consequently, except with very 
young children, is only to be regarded as a luxury. 
Sugar was formerly obtained almost entirely from the 
sugar-cane ; but at the present time very large quan- 
tities are made on the continent of Europe from beet- 
root. This sugar is now largely used in this country ; 
but its power of sweetening is not as great as that 
of cane-sugar. Treacle, which is an impure syrup 
obtained in producing white or refined sugar from the 
moist, or raw sugar, is largely used by the poor ; but 
it is not so economic a food as sugar itself, though 
convenient and useful in sweetening bread and for 
making puddings, &c. 

Sugar has a very great preservative power, con- 
sequently is largely used in making preserves, and it 
or treacle is most useful to assist in preparing hams, 
bacon, &c* 

5 1. Bread in this country is made of wheaten flour. 
Wheat when ground produces what is called whole 
meal. This may be separated by sifting into several 
distinct substances. The outer iskin, which is in large 

scales, is caHed Bran. This, contrary to a very 
prevaleat opinion, has no nutritive \a\u& ^loaXfiN^t. 



CH. VII.] FLOUR: ITS CONSTITUENTS, A'c. Si 

It is not capable of being digested, but irritates the 
digestive organs, sometimes to a very injurious extent 

The inner s^s are called pollard, sharps, and 
tniddlings. l^Le pollard, or coarsest, should be re- 
moved from the flour; but the finer inner skins, 
which constitute the middlings, contain a large pro- 
portion of albumenoid and oily substances, and it is 
economical to allow them to remain. The very finest 
and most expensive flour from which all the outer 
portions have been removed is termed pastry whites. 
That which is not so finely sifted is termed house- 
holds, or seconds, though the latter is usually made 
from wheat of slightly inferior quality, and is 
consequently cheaper. 

In consequence of the tenacious character of the 
gluten of the wheat, flour when mixed with water 
forms a tough dough. If yeast is added with the 
water a slight fermentation is caused, and gas is pro- 
duced which cannot escape owing to the tough nature 
of the dough. This gas fills the dough with air- 
bubbles, which cause it to swell or rise, and form 
when baked a light spongy bread. 

52. Bread-making. — In order to make the bread 
as light and spongy as possible, bakers mix a small 
quantity of the flour they are about to use with water 
and the yeast and set it to rise some time before 
mixing up the mass of dough ; this is called by them 
" setting the sponge." The advantage of this plan 
over that usually employed in making " home-made 
bread " is that a smaller quantity of yeast is reqi3ire.<i\

of the sponge, bakers always add a small quantity of 
mashed boiled potato, which greatly quickens the 
rising of the dough. 

To make half a peck of flour into bread on this 
system, take three-quarters of a pound of well-boiled 
mealy potatoes and mash them through a cullender or 
coarse sieve into a large pan, mix with them a pint of 
flour ; take an ounce and a half of German dried yeast, 
mix it in a separate basin with a pint and a half of 
lukewarm water,' and strain into the flour and pota- 
toes ; beating the whole well into a batter. This should 
then be covered with a blanket and set to rise by the 
side of the fire, or in a warm place. If kept quite warm 
it will be found to have risen greatly in two hours, con- 
stituting the sponge. This, which is very tenacious or 
gluey, should then be perfectly beaten or broken down 
with the hand, and mixed with one pint and a half of 
water nearly blood-warm ( 92° Fah.) and poured into 
half a peck of flour, which has previously had one 
ounce and a quarter of salt mixed with it. The whole 
should then be kneaded into dough, and allowed to 
rise in a warm place. In warm weather it will rise 
sufiiciently in two hours ; but in cold weather it will 
take a longer time. After the dough has risen, it 
should be turned out on a floured table or paste-board, 
divided into pieces of the size required for loaves, and 
lightly kneaded up into shape, with sufficient flour to 
prevent its adhering to the table * 

If required to be made into lighter bread, a portion

of the dough, when ready for the oven, should be very 
well kneaded, with sufficient flour to make it rather 
solid, divided into small loaves or rolls, placed on a 
slightly greased tin, and set in a very warm place to 
rise again. The loaves are then washed over with a 
little milk and baked immediately for about twenty 
minutes. They should be covered over with cloth 
after removal from the oven, to prevent the outside 
becoming hard. 

Bakers' bread sometimes contains a small propor- 
tion of alum ; this is added to inferior flour, made 
from wheat harvested in wet seasons, in order to 
prevent it making sticky and uneatable bread. 

Bread contains nearly half its weight of water; 
good freshly ground flour absorbing or taking up a 
larger quantity than such as has been long exposed to 
the air. 

Newly baked bread is much less digestible than 
that which has been baked the previous day. Stale 
bread may be rendered soft and palatable by cover- 
ing it closely with a tin and placing it for half an hour 
in an oven very moderately heated. 

Pulled Bread, which is very useful with cheese or 
in place of biscuit, is made by pulling the crumb of 
a loaf in pieces with t^-o forks and baking them in a 
slack oven until of a very pale brown colour. 

Pastry differs from bread in being made with a 
proportion of fat, as suet, dripping, lard or butter. It 
is not as easily digested as bread, though very nutri- 
tious, and is therefore not suited for invalids. Direc- 
tions for making the most usefvil kvwis. ^^k^ Vr. ^ks^ss^

raising unfermented bread, and is also of great use in 
making pastry, cakes, &c. It consists of substances 
that effervesce or give out a gas when moistened. The 
best baking powder may be very cheaply made by 
mixing two ounces of bicarbonate of soda, one ounce 
and a quarter of tartaric acid, and a quarter of a pound 
of corn flour, or ground rice. These ingredients 
should be quite dry, and perfectly mixed by passing 
them twice through a sieve. The powder should be 
kept in a canister or bottle closely corked, so as to 
prevent its becoming moist. The preparations sold 
as ^gg powder are of a similar character and use, but 
they do not add to the nutritious value of the food in 
the same manner as eggs. Patent and self-raising 
flour is merely flour to which soda and tartaric acid 
has been added, 

54. Oatmeal. — Oatmeal though highly nutritive 
does not contain a tough and adhesive gluten like that 
of wheat, and cannot therefore be made into fer- 
mented bread. It is largely used in the north of 
England and in Scotland in the form of oatcakes and 
porridge. Oatcakes are made by moistening the meal, 
so as to make it adhesive, and rolling it into thin cakes, 
which are baked on a hot plate. The best method 
of making porridge is to strew oatmeal with one hand 
into' a vessel of boiling water (to which salt has been 
previously added), so gradually that it does not be- 
come lumpy, stirring the mixture all the time with the 
other hand. After about two large handfuls of coarse 
oatmeal have been stirred in to a quart of boiling water, 
the whole should be allowed to stand by the sidd 
of the fire, so as to simmer gently and thicken fot

with milk. It is excellent for children, being very 
nutritious, wholesome, and economical. 

Oatmeal should only be purchased at places where 
there is a quick sale for it, as it absorbs moisture 
from .the air, and very quickly becomes rancid and 
unpleasant. 

Barley, when its husk is taken off, is termed Scotch 
or pearl barley, which is very useful in soups anci 
broth, it requires from two to four hours* cooking. 

Rice from its cheapness is very largely used in this 
country. It contains a less amount of albumenoid 
substances than other grains, and scarcely any oily 
material, being chiefly starch, hence it should always 
be used with milk, eggs, and fatty substances. (47.) 
When rice is the same price as household flour the 
latter is by far the more economical food. 

Maize is one of the cheapest of the com 
plants, but as it does not yield a tenacious dough, 
cannot be made into light fermented bread. In 
America, where it is largely used, it is employed as 
oatmeal is in Scotland in making cakes and a kind 
of porridge. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

PULSE, PEAS, BEANS, AND FRESH VEGE- 
TABLES. 

55. Peas, Beans, and Haricots are valuable 
articles of food. They differ greatly from grain in 
containing a less amount of starch and fat, and a 
much larger quantity of albumenoid matter, which so 
closely resembles the caseine of curd of milk that 
cheese can be made of it. From their very dry and 
hard nature they require good cooking to render them 
easily digestible, and even when well cooked they do 
not agree with all persons. 

Peas. — These are often used in the green state. 
Dried peas are chiefly used in making soup, and in 
this form they furnish a very*economical dish for strong 
healthy persDns from the quantity of albumenoid sub- 
stance they contain, the addition of animal food is 
scarcely . required ; the liquor, however, in which 
meat has been boiled or stewed may be used with 
advantage. Pea-soup may also be made exceedingly 
savoury without meat, by previously frying the 
vegetables, the celery, carrots, onions, or leeks in 
dripping, with a little flour, until of a brown colour, 
and then adding them to the soup. The quality of 
pe^ varies very much ; some are good boWet^, o'Omi^

to mix with the water, and are, therefore, unfit for 
soup; good boilers readily dissolve in two or three 
hours. Dried peas should not be used in the whole 
state, as the shells or skins are exceedingly indigestible. 

Haricots are the seeds of white kidney and run- 
ner beans. They are greatly used on the continent 
as a vegetable and in soups. When required as a 
vegetable they should be placed in water Ae previous 
night so as to soak thoroughly, they then require 
less boiling and are softer; when cooked they are 
eaten with meat, gravy, melted dripping or butter. 

The seeds of any of the varieties of French bean 
or scarlet runner may be employed in a similar man- 
ner, but from the colour of the skins they are less 
sightly on the table. 

Lentils are largely used on the continent in the 
same manner as dried peas are in England. 

Ground lentil flour is sold as ^' Revalenta '' for 
the use of invalids, but it is only fitted for persons of 
strong digestion. 

56. Fresh Vegetables. — The use of fresh green 
vegetables is necessary to health. Persons deprived of 
them for any great length of time, as sailors sometimes 
are at sea, become subject to a very serious and fatal 
disease termed scurvy. The number of firesh vege- 
tables used as food is very great, but the most valuable 
are potatoes, cabbages, turnips, carrots, parsnips, and 
onions. Peas and beans are also largely used in a 
green state.

CHAPTER IX. 
CONDIMENTS : SALT, PEPPER, SPICES, &c. 

60. The most important condiments are salt, pep- 
per, and mustard — of these salt alone is a necessary 
of life. The others are useful if used in small 
quantity to render food more palatable, but employed 
in large quantity they are injurious, and not required 
by the young, whose powers of digestion are good. 

61. Salt is absolutely essential to health, and even 
to life. It is one of the most abundant of all 
minerals ; in many places it is found in the earth in 
great quantities. Sea water contains three parts in 
every hundred; it is found in small amount in all 
soils, in spring and river water, and in all those 
vegetables which are used for the food of man and 
animals. 

Salt when taken in the food supplies two substances, 

an acid which helps to form tiie sour fluid of the 

stomach that digests oiu: food, and soda, which is the 

bile, a fluid which must be added to the dissolved or 

softened food before the nourishment can be extracted

person requires is between a quarter to half an 
ounce daily. A large part of this is contained in the 
various articles of food and drink. 

Salt possesses the power of preserving meat and 
other substances. It acts by removing a large pro- 
portion of the liquid parts. The injurious effect of 
salted meat, when used for a lengthened period, has 
already been described (27). 

Salt is largely employed in some countries in pre- 
serving green vegetables for winter use. Thus French 
beans may be kept for many months by cutting them 
in slices, packing them in a jar with layers of salt, and 
pressing them down so that no part comes above the 
brine, which flows out. If tied over and placed in a 
cool situation they will keep a long time, and are ready 
for use as soon as the salt brine is washed away. In 
many countries cabbages and cucumbers and other 
vegetables are preserved in the same manner. 

Salt should always be taken with our meals, for a 
sufficient quantity does not exist in our food to supply 
the wants of the body. 

62. Vinegar. — Vinegar is an acid liquid, obtained 
in this country by allowing a kind of weak beer to 
become sour. 

It has the power of preventing substances putrefy- 
ing, and is used for this purpose in making pickles. 
If taken with our food in small quantity it helps us 
to digest many substances that are difficult of diges- 
tion ; in large quantity it is very injurious. It is 
employed in cookery to assist in softening the fibres 
of tough meat,^ and to pickle fish^ ve^^^fc^s.^^ ^^

62 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

Pickled vegetables, as onions, cabbage, &c., are very 
difficult of digestion, and if taken in laige quantity are 
decidedly injurious. 

63. Mustard is one of the most common condi- 
ments. If used in small quantity it promotes the 
appetite and increases the digestive power, but taken 
too freely it irritates the stomach and is very injmious. 
As a medicine mustard is of very great use, spread on 
calico and applied to the skin it relieves internal 
inflammation, by drawing the blood to the surface, 
in this manner it often relieves the most violent pain, 
and may be safely used in the absence of medical 
aid. 

64. Pepper is the spice most frequently employed 
in this country ; like other spices it is useful in sea- 
soning, but great care should be taken not to use it in 
large quantity, as it injures the stomach and renders 
the digestion of plain food difficult. Children should 
not be accustomed to highly spiced and seasoned 
dishes. 



\ 



CHAPTER X. 
BEVERAGES : TEA, COFFEE, COCOA, BEER, ftc. 

65. Tea is more used in this country than any 
other unintoxicating beverage. Taken in moderate 
quantity it is not injurious, but in lai^e quantity it 
is hurtful, especially to persons who are not well 
fed. Tea is best made in an earthenware teapot, 
which should be kept dry, for if allowed to remain 
damp after use it acquires a musty flavour. The 
water should be boiling, and, if possible, soft; when 
hard water is used, it may be softened by being 
kept boiling for half-an-hour, when the lime which 
causes the hardness is pardy thrown down, forming 
what is called fur or rock on the kettle ; or a very 
small quantity of carbonate of soda may also be used, 
or the tea may be allowed to remain soaking for half- 
an-hour by the fire-side, or be covered over with a 
woollen cover to prevent the escape of heat. As a 
general rule, the harder the water the longer the tea 
should be allowed to remain before use, care being 
taken to keep its temperature as near as practicable 
to that of the boiling point. 

66. Coffee is more stitiwi\a^^'&i«^ ^^^

digestion. Like tea, if drunk strong, it produces 
wakefulness, which sometimes lasts for many hours. 
Coffee contains a bitter principle, but its flavour 
mainly depends upon a volatile substance which 
is driven off by boiling; to preserve its taste, it 
should therefore be made without boiling. The 
French coffee-pots, made of two cylindrical vessels, the 
upper having a metal strainer on which the ground 
coffee is placed, and through which the clear infusion 
runs into the lower one, are the best The flavour of 
coffee is also very greatly improved by the employment 
of hot boiled mUk. 

Chicory is the root of a plant A\Tien roasted it is 
used with ground coffee to give colour and flavour ; it 
is most advantageous to purchase it separately and 
mix it in the proportion of one part to ^ree or four 
of coffee. 

67. Cocoa. — Cocoa and chocolate are prepared 
from the crusted seeds of an American plant The 
kernels contain nearly half their weight of fat Cocoa 
is much more nutritious than tea or coffee, but not so 
stimulating. Chocolate is made of the pure kernels 
ground in a mill with sugar. Cocoa should con- 
tain the ground kernels only, but the husks are 
ground up with the cheaper kinds, which also contain 
potato-starch, and earthy substances, as red ochre, &a 
Soluble cocoa contains a large proportion of starch, 
which thickens when boiling water is poured upon it. 
Genuine ground cocoa unmixed with other substances 
cannot be sold under one shiUing to fourteenpence 
per pound. 

Cocoa is a very irAoIesome and nutritious \i^N^t«%^>

and coffee objectionable to some people ; and is far 
better for working men and for children. 

68. Beer and other intoxicating drinks are taker 
as luxuries. There is no doubt that they are not 
necessaries of life. To children all stimulants are 
particularly injurious, and they are never taken 
willingly, unless the child has been trained to use 
them. If children are brought up without them their 
strength and health are much better than those of 
children who take them, and they can do more work 
and endure more fatigue. 

There is more support and strength to be obtained 
from a pint of milk than a gallon of beer. To old 
persons who have been accustomed to the use of 
spirits and beer for many years they often become 
necessary, but it is exceedingly wrong to teach children 
to use them.

one that is closed up. A room 12 feet square by 
10 feet in height, would contain 1,440 cubic feet ot 
air. In barracks this would only be regarded as 
space for two men, and in the best hospitals for 
one patient. 

In the country every cottage for a working man 
with a grown up family should have three bedrooms — - 
one for the husband and wife, one for the elder boys, 
and a third for the girls. One of these bedrooms at 
least should have a fire-place, to be used in case of 
illness ; and for the sake of ventilation, it is better 
that each one should be so provided 

Every cottage should have a living-room not less 
than 12 feet square, and a small scullery or wash- 
house. A small pantry for food is necessary; this 
should have a window able to be opened outside 
of the cottage into the air. A place for tools, and 
another for fuel, are desirable. Every house should 
have a back as well as a front door, so that by open- 
ing both in summer thorough ventilation may be 
effected. If the front door opens into the sitting-room, 
there is in cold weather a great loss of heat each 
time the door is opened, and the sudden change of 
temperature often gives rise to colds and coughs, 
the fi-ont door should always be made to open into 
a porch or lobby.

is much better to purchase furniture of a durable 
kind, although the first cost is greater. 

Articles purchased at cheap shops are always made 
of bad materials and are very much the dearest. 




It is desirable in a working man's house not to use 
furniture which requires much time and trouble in

CHAPTER XII. 

WATER SUPPLY: QUALITIES OF WATER, 
INFLUENCE ON HEALTH; WASHING, 

COOKING, &c. 

75. The goodness of the water used by us is of 
very great importance. Many more diseases are 
caused by bad water than even by bad food. Water 
forms three-quarters of our weight, and before any part 
of our food can be taken into our bodies it must be 
dissolved in the watery fluids of the stomach. All 
fresh vegetables contain a very large proportion of 
water. Thus potatoes consist of three-quarters, and 
turnips and cabbage of upwards of nine-tenths, of their 
weight of this liquid. Even the driest vegetable sub- 
stances contain a large proportion. Dry wheaten flour 
has fifteen pounds of water in every hundred ; this is 
driven ofl* by the heat when it is baked in making 
infant's food;^ and bread contains one third of its 
weight of water. 

76. Water has so great a power of dissolving other 
substances, that it is not found anywhere in a perfectly 
pure state, but has always in it mineral substances, 
sometimes decaying vegetable and even animal mate- 

ri^ls derived, from the soil or earth thrcugh which it 
^ows, and gases and odours absorbed fiom the air. 

^ See Appendix, First "Lessoti. 



CH. XII.] WATER SUPPLY— QUALITIES, &*c, 73 

77. In large towns water is usually supplied by the 
water companies through pipes, having been obtained 
from rivers. The water is generally supplied only for 
a short time each day, and the quantity received has 
to be stored up in cisterns or water-butts. These 
should be very frequently cleaned out, as the impurities 
of the water settle at the bottom and are stirred up 
each time the fresh water comes in. Water-butts and 
cisterns should never be placed near any decaying 
matters, such as manure heaps, or in close underground 
cellars, or near cesspools or drains, as the water very 
quickly absorbs the gases and bad smells arising from 
such substances, and becomes unwholesome. Water 
standing for a night in a close or crowded room 
absorbs the impure air and becomes unpleasant to 
the taste and injurious to health. When the waste or 
overflow pipe from a cistern runs into a drain the foul 
air rises up the pipe and renders the water unwhole- 
some, and the same evil arises if the cistern supplies 
a water-closet. 

78. River water varies very much in quality, that 
from some rivers contains a great amount of decaying 
matter from the sewers and drains that run into them ; 
such water should not be used if it is possible to 
avoid it, but if no other can be obtained, it should be 
filtered and boiled before being drunk, or used in 
preparing food. 

All river water contains a small proportion of chalk, 
or carbonate of lime, dissolved in it If the quantity 
is large the water is said to be hard — the greater the 
proportion of chalk the harder the water. The watet 
of the river Thames, with 'wVacSa. V)ci<& ^^•^^^t ^-wx «:K 
London is supplied, contains fo\«X.eeti ^ivxv'^ ^^ ^^jk;^ 



74 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 

« - 

in each gallon. Very little chalk (only two grains in 
every gallon) can be dissolved by pure water. The 
large quantity found in river and spring water is dis- 
solved by means of a gas, called carbonic acid gas, 
which is always present. When the water is heated 
this gas is driven oflf in small bubbles, which may be 
seen just before the water reaches the boiling point ; 
the chalk is then thrown down in a solid form, 
rendering the water slightly cloudy or turbid, and 
afterwards it settles down on the sides and bottoms 
of boilers or kettles forming the rock or fur which 
is always found in old boilers. 

When green vegetables are boiled in hard water, 
the chalk causes them to be of a dull colour j and 
when clothes are boiled in hard water, as is sometimes 
done in washing, the rock or fur settles on them, 
causing them to be of a bad colour, the dirt being 
fixed in the clothes. 

When hard water is used for cooking or washing it 
is best to boil it for a few minutes before using it, as 
then the fur is thrown down on the sides of the 
boiler, and not on the food or clothes. Hard water 
» is not good for making tea, as the strength of the 

tea-leaves is very slowly extracted. 

The bad effects of hard water in cooking may be 
partly remedied by using a small quantity of carbonate 
of soda, or even common washing soda, this softens 
the water, but if much be added it gives a soapy, un- 
pleasant taste ; as much as would cover a sixpenny- 
piece may be added to a large saucepan of greens, 
^ad about a. quarter as much to a large teapot of tea.

never be used in places that are thickly populated or 
highly manured, for the water is rendered impure by 
the decaying animal and vegetable substances in the 
soil, and becomes very unwholesome. 

When shallow wells are situated near cesspools or 
drains, the water becomes quite poisonous, and gives 
rise to cholera, fevers, and other fatal diseases. The 
water of wells situated in large cities, or near grave- 
yards, is always to be avoided. 

80. The water from deep wells is generally free 
from any decaying vegetable matter or drainage, and 
is wholesome as a beverage, but it most frequently is 
excessively hard from containing a large amount of 
chalk dissolved in it, 

8t. Rain water is very pure if collected in country 
districts where there is but little smoke, but in towns 
it is always blackened by soot. It is very soft, being 
perfectly free from mineral substances, and if collected 
in proper tanks free from leaves of trees and other 
decaying substances is very well fitted for cooking, 
drinking and washing.

CHAPTER XIII. 

AIR AND VENTILATION. 

82. The Air we breathe is necessary to purify th( 

blood and to support life. Air, though invisible, is : 

material substance, a quantity of it in a bladder or aii 

tight bag prevents the sides being pressed together ; i 

also possesses weight ; a box, each side of which is on< 

foot square (or one cubic foot), contains one ounc( 

and a quarter of air. The air in a room twelve fee 

square and eight feet in height weighs ninety pounds. 

S^, Air is not a simple substance, but a mixture 

several gases. The most important of these is oxy 

gen, which forms one-fifth part of its bulk. It is th< 

oxygen which purifies the blood when we breathe, an< 

it also enables combustible substances to bum whei 

set on fire. The remaining four-fifths of the air consis 

chiefly of nitrogen, which serves to dilute the oxygei 

and render it milder, otherwise both our breathinj 

and the burning of fires would go on too rapidly.

acid. This is very injurious if breathed. Air con- 
taining only one-thousandth part (jTHnr) ^^ carbonic 
add destroys health if breathed for any length of time. 
In crowded places, or in bed or sitting-rooms when 
the doors and windows have been kept closed for 
some time after they have been occupied, the air often 
contains two or three times as much of this poisonous 
gas, or from two to three parts in a thousand. If this 
air is breathed for any length of time it speedily causes 
headache, weariness, and loss of strength. Persons 
who spend great part of their lives in rooms filled 
with bad air become pale and sickly, and are liable 
to many more diseases than those living in pure air. 

85, The air always contains a considerable quantity 
of moisture, which varies very mudi at different times 
of the year and in different places. When the quan- 
tity of moisture is so great that it settles upon objects 
and makes them damp, it is injurious to health ; and 
houses in which the walls and foundations are damp 
are always unhealthy. 

A large quantity of moisture passes away from the 
body in the air that is breathed out from the lungs, 
and a great amount is produced by the burning of 
gas and other lamps. 

86. Not only is the air of close rooms and houses 
rendered injurious by the carbonic acid and water 
produced, but it is made still more poisonous by the 
decaying animal matter which passes off in our 
breath, and which is also given out by the walls and 
floors of unclean houses, by dirty clothes, and by 
that air which comes into the house through drains 
or passes over stinking dusl-b\as 2xA\\Ra?^^^^ ^^^raic^'?^

CHAPTER XIV, 

FIRING: STOVES, RANGES, AND ECONOMICAL 
MANAGEMENT OF FUEL. 

91. The fuel used for cooking our food and 
warming our dwellings is usually coal or coke ; in some 
parts wood or peat is employed, and occasionally 
coal gas. 

92. The heat produced during the burning of fuel 
is given out when the carbon of the fuel unites with 
the oxygen of the air, and carbonic acid gas is pro- 
duced, as it is by the breathing of men and animals. 
This poisonous gas usually passes up the chimney with 
some unburned carbon which forms the smoke. 

When charcoal is burnt, the carbonic acid is pro- 
duced without smoke, and therefore it is often used in 
stoves without chimneys, and the carbonic acid escap- 
ing into rooms is frequently the cause of fatal accidents. 
All stoves without flues or chimneys to carry off the 
carbonic acid are dangerous, and many persons have 
/f^en poisoned by their having been used. 
PJ' The heat produced by the burning oi axv^ V\M 



CH. XIV.] FIRING: STOVES, RANGES, ^c. 8l 

of fuel makes the air in and around the fire much 
lighter, and it rises rapidly over the fire, usually passing 
^ up the chimney. More tlian nine-tenths ( j^) of the heat 
of a common grate passes up the chimney in this 
manner, and is wasted. If the grate is constructed of 
thick solid metal, this conducts away a large quantity 
of the heat so that it is impossible to keep in a very 
small fire in an iron range, whereas a mere handful of 
fuel can be kept alight in a grate lined with fire brick 
or fire-clay which does not cool the burning fuel in the 
same manner metal does. Part of the heat produced 
is thrown out by the fire, and passes into the room. In 
ordinary grates the amount of heat passing off in this 
manner is very much lessened by the thick bars which 
are frequently placed in the front of the grate. 

94. Ordinary fire-grates are most extravagant modes 
of using fuel, and are not employed by the people of 
any other nation. Not only is a good deal of the 
heat carried away up the chimney, and by the con- 
ducting power of the iron, but the shape of the grate 
and the bars also prevents much being thrown out 
into the room. 

95. An ordinary grate may, however, be made more 
economical. If it be lined with bricks, tiles, or fire- 
clay, and the open bars underneath be closed, either 
by fire-clay or a piece of tin plate, the air will have 
to enter in front where the fire will be brightest, and 
no heat will be thrown down into the ash pit. 

96. Cooking ranges with an oven on one side are 
very useful in a small family. If well constructed they 
will bake bread, meat, and pies or T^viddvsss^ ^^^

for Stewing, and slow cooking can be done on the top 
much better than over a common fire. 

A boiler by the side is not so important as an oven, . 
Boilers are liable to get filled with the deposit or rock 
from the water j and if they are of cast iron, they are 
apt to crack. 

As an example of a good cheap open range, the 
following may be taken ; it has a fire<lay back to 




prevent the heat passing away where it is not required, 
a good sized oven with the door to let down in fronti 
and a boiler. Grates of this kind are not made by 
many manufacturers, and are sold at a low price. 
P7. Cooking stoves are much more convenient 
»ad economical in use than ranges. They are used by 
almost all persons in America, and are now verj\MSt\i

employed in this country. A very good pattern is 
shown in the engraving. It has an open fire lyhich 
can be used for broiling and toasting. This £re is 
quite under control, and can be raised or lowered in 
a few minutes by opening or closing the doors so as 
to cause a strong cuirent of air to pass through the 




burning fuel or over it as required. The size shown 
will bake a joint as large as a leg of mutton, or two 
tins of bread admirably. 

The cooking vessels can be pufdown on the fire or 
placed on the hot iron top, and shifted so as to receive 
as much heat as required. 

The stove can also be useA as a. \\o\. ■^>aiR ^-^

preserving or stewing. The open fire is cheerful, 
and the stove is a good heating stove as well as 
cooking stove. Any large boiler placed on the top 
will furnish an unlimited supply of hot water. If 
placed in front of an open fire-place these stoves 
require about six feet of iron pipe to be placed up the 
chimney. Being perfectiy movable they can be carried 
by the owner from one house to another and placed 
in front of any fire-place. They are sold by Smith 
and Welstood, Ludgate Circus. 

98. Gas-stoves. — Gas when employed as ordinary 
fuel is exceedingly expensive, being at least five or six 
times as dear as coal. When the gas is burned inside 
the oven in which meat is to be baked the vapour 
arising from the burnt gas renders the meat sodden 
and unpleasant, and quite different from the meat 
cooked in an ordinary oven or before the open fire. 

Gas can however be used as an occasional source 
of heat with great economy as it is instantly lighted 
and put out ; there is no waste of fuel or loss of time. 
The best small gas stoves are those that can be placed 
on a table and bum the gas mixed with air, when it 
produces a pale blue flame which does not smoke 
any vessel placed within it. These stoves are particu- 
larly useful in heating a kettle of water in the summer 
time, or when there are no fires in the house. 



CHAPTER XV. 

LIGHTING : CANDLES, PETROLEUM, BENZO- 
LINE, AND GAS LAMPS, THEIR MANAGE- 
MENT, ETC. 

99. Flame, which gives the light employed in our 
houses during the absence of the light of the sun, is 
always produced by the burning or combustion of 
inflammable gas. 

When a candle is lit, the fat, wax, or other material 
of which it is formed, is melted, then drawn upwards 
into the flame by the attraction of the wick, it is there 
heated so strongly that it is converted into gas, which 
bums as fast as it is made^ thus producing the flame. 
In oil lamps the same happens, and in gas burners the 
gas bums as it escapes. 

ICC. The gas which is burnt to give us artificial 
light, whether obtained from coals and supplied through 
pipes, or produced in the burning of a lamp or candle, 
consists chiefly of two substances, namely, hydrogen, 
which is always a gas, and carbotv,\q\C\05v^«^^:^^^'^ 
united with hydrogen or any otYvti svaJc^^X-axvc^K^N^^^^^' 
a black solid, like charcoal ox soov. 



86 HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT AND COOKERY. 



I o I . Both these substances bum in the flame, uniting 
with the oxygen of the air. The hydrogen in burning 
forms water, a large quantity of which passes oflf from 
every flame in the form of vapour or steam. Many 
gas lights in a close room make the air very damp, 
and the moisture they produce may often be seen 
settling on the cold glass of the windows, or even run- 
ning down the walls. The carbon or charcoal when 
burnt forms carbonic acid, an invisible gas. When 
there are many gas lights in a badly ventilated room, 
or even one in a room that is not ventilated at all, the 
air becomes very unwholesome from the presence of 
carbonic acid gas. 

102. If there is not enough air to enable both the 
carbon and the hydrogen to burn, the hydrogen bums 
first, and part of the carbon passes off in the form 
of smoke. By putting any cold pieces of metaJ, glass, 
or earthenware into a flame, the carbon is prevented 
from burning and settles on the metal or glass, cover- 
ing it with black soot. 

103. Candles, which were formerly very generally 
used, give out very little light and are the dearest mode 
of producing light. 

Much may be learned of the nature of flame by 
watching attentively that of a common candle j at the 
bottom is a pale blue light which is caused by the 
fresh air rising against the flame and producing the 
perfect burning of both the carbon and the hydrogen ; 
in the interior of the flame is a dark centre which 
consists of the unburnt inflammable gas rising from 
the wick; this cannot bum until it reaches the air 
outside. The outside of the flame is very bright — it is 
tAere only the gas burns. 



CH. XV.] LIGHTING. 87 

If a small slip of wood be held for a moment 
steadily across the centre of a flame, it will be seen 
that the part in the middle is not burnt, only that 
which was at the outside of the flame. 

104. The oil used in lamps is of two distinct 
kinds. The fat greasy oils, such as seal or whale oil 
from animals, and olive or colza oil from vegetables. 
To obtain a good light from these fat oils it is necessary 
to make the flame hollow, and admit air into the in- 
terior, as is done in what is termed an Argand burner. 

In order to cause a strong current of air through 
the flame of an Argand, a tall glass chimney is requisite. 

105. The mineral oils, called paraffin or petro- 
leum oils, are the cheapest oils in use They contain a 
very great amount of carbon or charcoal, and if they are 
burned without a chimney this escapes into the air in 
dark clouds of black smoke. These oils, therefore, 
require to be burned in a properly constructed lamp, 
so that sufficient air shall be sent against the flame to 
consume all the carbon. 

The best paraffin lamps are those with a single flat 
wick, which is able to be turned to any required height 
above the wick tube a, by small toothed wheels turned 
by a handle, b. The large quantity of air required by 
the flame rises up through the cone or cap c, and is 
directed against the sides of the flame, producing a 
complete combustion of the carbon, and a very 
brilliant light. 

Paraffin or petroleum oils were formerly sold con- 
taining much volatile inflammable spirit. At the 
present time no mineral lamp oil tciM^X. \i^ ^0\.^^^^ics^J^ 
is dangerous. 

Petroleum lamps are peTiect\v ^^^^ ^^^^ ^-axs^^^

properly used. The oil-holder should be of glass, as 
if made of metal, it is apt to become heated. The 
lamps should always be filled before dark, and never 
after being lighted. 

Any oil spilled on the outside should be carefully 
wiped off, or it will produce a disagreeable smell when 




DIETZS FLAT WICK BURNER. 



the lamp is used. To light a petroleum lamp the 
glass chimney should be removed, then the wick turned 
above the slit in the cone, and when lighted instantly 
turned down again ; the chimney should then be put on 
and the wick turned up so as to produce a large bright 
flame without smoke, but so as to produce the full 
^ame, when the lamp bums without smelL If the 
^^^e IS turned down Jew, there is no saving ol o^> 



CH. XV.] LIGHTING. 89 

as a large quantity is sent off in vapour and produces 
a most disagreeable smell. 

106. Sponge or spirit lamps are made for using 
the very inflammable spirit termed benzoline. They are 
filled with sponge or cotton wool which is moistened 
with benzoline, the wick-holder is then screwed on and 
the wick turned up level to the top; when lighted a 
small flame, rather greater than that of a candle, is 
produced. As the benzoline is very inflammable these 
lamps should never be trimmed after dark, or near a 
fire, as the vapour may take light. If trimmed in the 
day-time, and only enough spurit poured in to moisten 
the cotton wool, they are quite safe, and are the cheap- 
est source of a small light. When used as night 
lights they should always be placed under a chimney as 
the vapour escapes and smells when they are turned 
down low. 

Coal gas is unquestionably the cheapest source of 
light, but its economy is not so great as is generally 
imagined ; the flame cannot always be brought 
where it is wanted, consequently a much greater 
amount of light is necessary than when movable 
lamps are employed. 

For small rooms, the two-hole, or fish-tail burner is 
best, being cheap, simple, and capable of causing a 
very perfect combustion of the gas. With this burner 
the flame is spread out into a thin, flat sheet, by the 
two currents of gas striking against one another. In 
a fish-tail biuner the gas should always be turned on 
so as to cause a fiill-sized flame without flickering, as 
otherwise the gas is not perfectly buirvt. ^.V-axs^^-^soj^^

light when placed horizontally, with the flat sides 
turned up and down, than when burned upright in a 
glass globe, when the flame always flickers and is 
injurious to the eyes. An ordinary-sized fish-tail con- 
sumes from three to four cubic feet of gas per hour, 
and gives the light of from six to nine candles. 

Where a great amount of light is required a circular 
or Argand burner is more economical than the fish-tail. 
In most burners the chimney is too high ; this causes 
too strong a current of air, and a great loss of light 
ensues. An Argand with a ring having fifteen holes, 
should not have a chimney more than seven inches 
high. Such a burner will consume about five cubic 
feet of gas in an hour, and give an amount of light 
equal to that of fifteen sperm candles. 

In all cases where gas is used, the room should be 
ventilated, or the air will become very unhealthy from 
the great amount of carbonic acid and vapour of 
water produced. 

Explosions sometimes occur when gas has escaped 
fi'om a leaky pipe or a burner that has been left open. 
The explosion is generally caused by some person 
taking a lighted candle to discover the leakage, when 
the escaped gas takes fire instantaneously, and burns 
with a violent explosion. Whenever there is a stroiig 
smell of escaped gas, the maincock at the meter should 
be immediately turned, and the doors and windows 
opened to allow the gas to escape. No attempt should 
be made to search for the leak with a light, but notice 
should instantly be given to a gas-fitter. 



CHAPTER XVL 

CLEANING, WASHING, AND GENERAL 

HOUSEWORK. 

107. The healthiness or unhealthiness of a house 
depends very greatly upon its degree of cleanliness; 
dirty, uncleaned houses are always more or less un- 
healthy. In country places, where the ground around 
a house is not paved with stone, care should be taken 
that no puddles of dirty water remain close to the 
house, as they not only render the air damp and 
unwholesome, but cause much dirt to be brought in 
on the feet. 

Slops of dirty water, tea-leaves, coffee-grounds, &c., 
should never be thrown out near the house, as they 
decay and are injurious. 

All decaying vegetable ajid animal matter near a 
house is injurious. Cabbage-leaves, potato and apple- 
parings, and other waste vegetables should never be 
thrown into the dust-bin, but should always be burnt ; 
which can always be done if they ai^ ^\'=x. ^sxv^^ Xs^

used for ashes ; instead of using dust-bins, it is a 
much better plan for the dust to be put into a 
galvanized iron pail and carried away each day, as 
is done in many towns, 

io8. The inside of the house not only becomes 
dirty by the dust carried in by the air and the dirt 
brought in by the feet, but from the odour or smell 
given out by our skin, and by the lungs with the 
breath. 

This smell or odour is absorbed by all porous 
substances, as the walls, floors, and ceilings \ it then 
decays, and gives rise to that close, sickening, un- 
wholesome smell, which is present in all dirty houses, 
especially such as are overcrowded. No house with 
such a smell can possibly be a healthy place to 
live in. This animal effluvium, or smell of decay- 
ing animal matter, is taken up by some substances 
much more readily than others. Walls that are 
covered with paper smell much more offensively than 
those that are painted. And in rooms where one 
paper has been pasted over another the whole thick- 
nesses of paper become very offensive and injurious to 
health. Painted or lime-washed walls are much 
to be preferred to papered walls for crowded dwellings 
and for all sleeping rooms. 

Woollen garments, carpets, and curtains absorb 
these smells freely, and give them out for a long 
time. Rough wooden floors also take them up, and 
consequently require frequent washing ; smoo thed 
waxed, or painted floors are mucli preferable to rough 
wooden ones. 

rop. The wholesomeness of a dwelling is much 
rncreased by its being frequently vj\\\te-^as\v^^. 



CH. XVI.] CLEANING, WASHING, ^'c. 9J 

White -wash is made by pouring water on cakes of 
whiting, and stirring until the liquid is like a thin 
cream, when a small quantity of warm size or dissolved 
glue is then added, to prevent the colour from 
rubbing off when dry. White-wash is applied with a 
broad, flat brush, working in a uniform direction up 
and down the walL It is requisite first to remove the 
dirt and the old white-wash by washing it away with 
a brush and abundance of clean water. 

I ID. Lrime-washing is a much more effectual 
mode of purification than white-washing, but is not so 
often used, as few persons know how to make IJbe-wash. 
If glue is used, it is destroyed by the lime, and the 
wash easily rubs off the walls when dry. This also 
happens if the lime be simply slaked in water and 
used without any fixing material. Lime-wash should 
be made by placing some freshly-burned quick-lime 
in a pail, and pouring on sufficient water to cover 
it; if the lime is fresh, great heat is given out; 
boiled oil (a preparation of linseed oil, sold by all 
oilmen) should then be added, one pint to each gallon 
of wash. For cheapness, any refuse fat, such as 
dripping, may be used instead of the boiled oil. The 
whole should then be thinned with water. The brush 
should not be left in the lime-wash or the bristles will 
be destroyed. Should coloured wash be required, 
one pound of green vitriol added to every two gallons 
of wash gives a very pleasing drab. 

Quick-lime slaked with skimmed milk, and after- 
wards thinned with water, makes an excellent wash

of purification, more especially when any infectious 
disorders are prevalent. 

111. Floors should not be scrubbed so frequently as 
is often recommended ; once a-week is generally quite 
sufficient. In damp weather wet floors do not dry, 
and the house remains damp and cold for a consid- 
erable time ; it is better, in all cases, to defer the 
scrubbing even for a week, than to wet the floors 

. on a rainy or foggy day. In cases of illness this is 
particularly important ; so injurious is damp air to 
invalids, that in some hospitals the floors are waxed, 
and dry rubbing used instead of scouring, with great 
advantage to the health of the patients. 

It should be a fixed rule that floors, particularly 
those of sleeping-rooms, are to be scrubbed only on 
dry days, and, where the health of the inmates is 
delicate, the dr3dng should be quickened by lighting 
a fire in the room. 

Kneeling when scrubbing sometimes causes a pain- 
ful disease of the knee-joint called " Housemaid's 
Knee." In order to prevent, as much as possible, 
this complaint, a thick soft mat should always be used 
to kneel upon. In §ome parts the scrubbing is done 
by men with a heavy stiff" brush fixed to a long handle, 
like house-brooms. 

112. No dirty old lumber should ever be allowed to 
collect in the house ; bones, old shoes and boots, old 
dirty woollen clothes, and pieces of carpet, are often 
kept : these render the air of the house impure, and 
consequently unwholesome, are exceedingly apt to be- 
come mouldy, harbour vermin, serve as breeding-places 

for the clothes-moth, and retain most teivaLciovisly any 
y^/ect/on to which they may have \>etxi ey^o?»t^. 



cU. XVI.] CLEANING, WASHING, &»c, 95 

Such things should always be got rid of; if not sold 
at once, if of any value, they had better be given away, 
or even burnt, rather than kept to render the air of 
the house impure and unwholesome. The Jews are 
remarkable for their good health and great freedom 
from infectious and contagious diseases : this is doubt- 
less in great part owing to the annual cleaning of the 
houses, when every part of the dwellings is thoroughly 
cleansed in the most perfect manner. 

113. The washing of dirty clothes is usually done 
with the aid of soap, soda, and washing preparations ; 
chloride of lime being sometimes also used. 

Washing-soda softens the water; it also possesses 
great powers of cleansing, as it removes stains and 
dissolves dirt and grease, rendering less rubbing 
necessary. 

Soda must not be used with coloured clothes, as it 
changes many colours. If white clothes, after being 
washed with soda, are not perfectly freed from it by 
rinsing in pure water, they will turn very yellow 
when heated or ironed, or even in drying or airing 
before the fire. Once produced, this yellow colour is 
very difficult to get rid of. 

114. Borax is much better than soda for fine, 
delicate things ; it is very much used by the French 
laundresses, as it saves soap, and does not injure the 
finest laces. It is used in the proportion of a hand- 
ful to ten gallons of water. 

115. Soap is made of caustic soda and fat: the latter 
renders the soda less destructive, but does not take 
away its power of loosening ditt. TVv^Xi^'sX. ^^'a?^'>s»>cs«^

soft, and causes it to dissolve very quickly when used. 
It is most economical to buy soap in bars, and then 
cut it up into small pieces to dry before use. 

1 1 6. Washing preparations and powders are 
very similar to soda in their action, some of them being 
very cleansing, and even corrosive in their properties. 
When used, the greatest care should be taken to rinse 
the clothes thoroughly after washing, so as to remove 
every portion, or the clothes will soon be weakened 
by their action. 

117. Chloride of lime is often used to remove 
stains, but it must be employed with great caution, as 
it is corrosive, and destroys all the colours of almost 
all dyed fabrics. 

118. The following practical directions on wash- 
ing were furnished by an experienced laundress : — 

" Wash as often as convenient. Dirty clothes put 
by for weeks are more difficult to clean the longer 
they remain dirty; they acquire a permanent bad 
colour, and in damp places are apt to become mil- 
dewed and rotten. 

" Remove all stains as soon as possible ; leave 

nothing long enough to fix itself thoroughly to the 

cloth ; wash out grease, gravy, and fruit-stains, &c., 

before putting anything on one side. Fruit-stains 

yield readily to bleachi ng-powder, — especially if, after 

being put on, it is moistened with a drop of some 

acid, as vinegar or lemon ; but neither acids nor 

bleaching-powder should be used to coloured things. 

Inkstains should never be put into soapy or soda 

vrater or lye, as they directly become iron-moulds; 

^ut should be instantly wetted with clean tj^Xw, ^x\d

salt of lemon, or oxalic acid, which should be washed 
out immediately. 

" After making starch, cover it with a plate until 
required for use ; otherwise it forms a useless skin on 
the top. To prevent starch sticking to the irons, 
the addition of a small piece of solid paraffin, as the 
end of a paraffin-candle, will be found more cleanly 
and efficacious than tallow. 

" When water has once been made to boil, the fire in 
the copper or grate may be very much lessened, as but 
little heat is required to keep it at the boiling point. 
There is no advantage whatever in making water boil 
furiously, for it is not in the slightest degree hotter 
than when merely simmering, as all the extra heat 
given to boiling water goes off in the steam, without 
raising the heat in the slightest degree. 

" The shrinking and discoloring of woollen articles 
may be in great part prevented by care in washing 
them. They should never be washed in hard water, 
nor in water softened by soda, nor should they be 
rubbed with soap. The fibres of wool are covered 
with little points, all directed one way; as the woollen 
is rubbed, these become tangled together, and form a 
kind of thick felt, by which means the article is shrunk 
and thickened. For the same reason it is not desir- 
able to wring woollen things. Before washing, they 
should be well brushed and shaken, to get rid of the 
dust ; rain, or soft river, water should have a strong 
lather made in it with soap, or, if the things are very

should be put in, and dipped and raised repeatedly for 
several minutes. It should then be squeezed (not 
wrung) as dry as possible from the dirty, slimy liquor, 
and the process, if necessary, repeated with some 
clean lather. If the article is not very dirty, and 
becomes quite clean in the first washing, the second 
washing may be in hot water only, without soap \ and 
in either case, a blue bag should be used in the last 
water. When gall has been used, a third water is 
necessary to take off the smell. When the article is 
finished, it should be squeezed as dry as it can be, 
and dried as quickly as possible in the open air, if the 
weather is fine." 



CHAPTER XVII. 
CLOTHING. 

119, Proper clothing is necessary to health, for 
when the skin is cold, and we feel chilly, the blood is 
sent to the internal organs of the body in increased 
quantity, and the perspiration and proper action of 
the skin being checked, ill-health is always caused , 
sometimes more serious results occur, and colds, and 
even other more dangerous diseases, are produced. 
) 120. All persons should be clothed so as to feel 
warm and comfortable in cold weather ; no person 
who always feels chilly can ever be in good health. 

" The clothes should be loose, so as not to impede 
muscular movement, and in the case of young girls 
nothing should be done to support the spine by stays 
or other contrivances. To make a girl tightly brace 
herself with stays is a great mistake. Her ribs should 
have the fullest play, and her clothes should be as 
loose as those of a boy, and for the same reason, viz., 
that every muscle may have unrestricted play, and 
that the lungs may expand without impediment. For 
both sexes girdles and belts, which e&^^cvakV^^ \j^^ 
the lower ribs, shouM be avoided.''^

121. Keeping the feet dry and warm is exceedingly 
necessary for all those persons predisposed to cold, 
or whose constitutions are delicate ; wearing worsted 
stockings in winter is, in such cases, particularly 
desirable. 

122. Cotton, being warmer and cheaper than linen, 
is generally employed for under-clothes. Woollen 
under-garments are, in this climate, essential to health 
in cold weather : the warmth obtained by wearing 
flannel next the body keeps up an action of the skin 
very beneficial to health. Sailors, and all persons 
much exposed to wet and cold, know the use of 
wearing flannel next the skin. For delicate children 
its use is extremely important; the oW practice of 
trying to make children hardy by exposure to cold 
when scantily dressed is very wrong; many weakly 
ones die under the process. 

123. Shoes, as generally made, are very faulty; 
naturally the broadest part of the foot is towards the 
front, and the great toe is m a straight line with the 
inner side, as shown in the first figure in accom- 
panying engraving. The boots and shoes are usually 
pointed at the front, forcing the toes together, and 
producing the deformity shown in the second figure; 
so general is this practice, that a natural-shaped foot 
is never seen in any adult who has worn shoes. Corns 
and bunions are the result of the constant pressure, 
and the power of easy walking is greatly interfered 
with. 

The sole of the shoe should always be made with 
the inner side straight, and not pointed, so as to 
^rce the great toe over the ad^omvii^ tot^ S!\oes

richer classes. The shoes of the labouring classes 
are unfortunately made in large numbers on lasts of 
the old pointed shape, and it will probably be some 
years before the right form of shoe reaches the working 
classes of this country. The high heels which are 
now used by some women are excessively injurious ; 
the weight of the body is thrown forward on the toes, 
which are tightly thrust into the fore part of the shoe, 
and the foolish wearers are crippled. 

In taking the measure of the foot, the person should 
stand on a sheet of paper, and have a line drawn

round the foot with a pencil ; the shoe should then 
be made to fit the foot, instead of endeavouring to fit 
the foot to the shoe. Children, from the soft state of ' 
their bones, have their feet and toes quickly deformed 
by tight, narrow shoes — a defect which lasts through 
life, producing, to a greater or less degree, lameness, 
and consequently inability to take active Q?t Xssw^k^^"^

warm in winter, and are exceedingly cheap and darable, 
a pair costing from 3^. to 3^*. 6^., lasting on the average 
twelve montlis ; they are very easy and comfortable 
to walk in ; for out-door labour in wet weather they 
far siurpass the ordinary shoes in dryness, comfort, 
and durability ; the greatest objection against their use 
arises from the noise they cause on stone or wood. 
Unfortunately, Uke the boots of the working classes, 
they are generally made pointed at the toes, and so 
force the great toe over the others. 

125. For boots and shoes exposed to wet the 
following composition is recommended : — 

** Linseed oil, one gill 3 spirit of turpentine, one 
ounce ; beeswax, one ounce ; Burgundy pitch, half- 
an-ounce : to be melted together, and rubbed into 
the leather when quite dry, before the fire- or in the 
hot sun." This composition will be found very 
effectual in preserving the leather from both rain and 
sea-water. 



APPENDIX. 



The following Notes of a course of Twenty Lessons have 
been prepared by one of the teachers ofTKE National 
Training School of Cookery, :youth Kensington, 
They are based on the principles taught in that In- 
stitution^ and were expressly arranged for the use 
of teachers in the Schools established by The School 
Board of London. 



FIRST LESSON. 

LIGHTING A FIRE, MILK AND EGGS, CHILDREN S 

FOOD. 

To Light a Fire. — In a close stove the first thing is to empty 
the fireplace. Take out the larger cinders and half-burnt coal 
with your fingers, and lay them on one side for lighting the fire ; 
then rake out all the ashes (this can be done with the lids on, 
then it will not make so much dust). Next take off all the lids, 
and sweep all the soot carefully out ; once or twice a week the 
flue pipe must be taken off and cleared out ; abo the flues under 
the oven. The soot should be carried away at once, as it blows 
about. Then black-lead the stove ; put in a few cinders, lay on 
them a piece of paper and a few sticks crossing one another, on 
these lay very ligntly some pieces of half-burnt coal and a few 
cinders, leaving space for draught Do not fill the grate full, put 
the lids on, draw out the damper, light the fire, and shut the 
front door. An open fire is lighted in much the same way. 
There are no flues to clean out ; but the chimney as high as oive.

hearth. 



104 APPENDIX, 



To Make Tea and Coffee. — Rinse the kettle and fill it from the 
tap (not the boiler). When it boils make your tea and coffee. 
Warm the teapot : alloiv one teaspoonful to each person and 
one for the pot After filling the teapot, let it stand five 
minutes. Broken-leaf good tea is better than cheap tea ; it does 
not take so much of it to make a good cup of tea. Warm your 
coffeepot. One ounce or one tablespoonful of ground coffee will 
make a pint. Pour on it one and a quarter pint of boiling water ; 
let it stand five minutes ; clear by pouring in a little cold water and 
letting it stand a few minutes. This coffee could have a little 
more water added after the first pint had been poured off for 
the children. Neither tea nor coffee are good if made with 
water that has remained in the kettle for many hours. 

To Boil an Egg. — Put it gently into a saucepan iiill of boiling 
water (and don't let it boil hard) for three minutes. 

To Poach Eggs. — Break the e^[S one by one into a good- 
sized saucepan of boiling water, with a teaspoonful of sak in it. 
Draw the saucepan to the side of the fire and Let them be in four 
minutes. Take them out with a slice. 

To Beat up an Egg for an Invalid. — Choose a fresh one ; break 
it into a cup and beat it lightly two minutes with a fork. Raw 
eggs are considered more digestible with a spoonful of water or 
milk added to them. Wine is frequently used. 

Thick Milk. — To one pint of milk stir one tablespoonful of 
flour and a pinch of salt ; boil over the fire for ten minutes, 
stirring all the time. An excellent breakfast for children. 

Infants* Pood. — Flour baked in a slow oven till of a light 
fawn, or put in a basin tied over with a cloth and boiled six 
hours. Crush the lumps, mix smooth with cold water, and boil 
three minutes. Add milk and sugar. Pap made with bread,, being 
fermented, is apt to turn sour, and that made from biscuits it 
objectionable from the butter in them. 

Teacup Puddings. — One dessertspoonfiil of corn-flour, half pint 
of milk, six lumps of sugar, a few grains of salt ; stir liiese on the 
fire to boil five minutes, add one tgig^ beat up until well mixed ; 
pour this into a buttered cup, and boil twenty-five minutes. 

Milk Porridge.— Put on one pint of skim-milk to boil, mix 
one tablespoonful of oatmeal with two of milk very smoothly; 
When the milk boils, pour it in and stir over the fire for ten 
minutes. 

Batter Pudding. — Beat Op an ^g "wixVv otie \B>c\ts'^ioi!&\i!L ^ 
^f"': *^^ « grain of salt, add "Sf degroea a cm^^Y dl tuSiiL^ 
^^irring vigorously. Boil half an hour in a gcca&fcd cm^. 



APPEJ^DI^. I05 



Rice Milk. — Put half a pint of milk on to boil, take from it two 
tablespooniiils to mix smooth with one dessertspoonful of ground 
rice. Pour this into the boiling milk and stir over the fire ten 
minutes. N.B. It is most essential that all farinaceous foods 
should absolutely boil in the milk or water. Starchy foods 
should never be given to children made with water alone, as they 
are not nutritive without the albumenoid principles the milk 
contains. 

Materials required for Lesson : — 6 eggs, 2 qts. of milk, 2 ozs. 
of lump sugar, 2 oz. of moist ditto, 2 oz. of corn-flour, \ oz. 
of ground rice, \ oz. of salt, I lb. of flour, ^ oz. of tea, i oz. o 
co&e, I oz. of oatmeal, |oz. of butter. 



SECOND LESSON. 

ROASTING, AND THE PUDDINGS EATEN WITH 

ROAST MEAT. 

To Roast a Joint. — Have a clear fire and the stove and hearth 
well swept up so that there is no occasion to make a dust while 
the meat is down. Allow a quarter of an hour to each pound of 
meat, and one quarter of an hour over. White meats, such 
AS pork and veal and very thick joints, want a little longer. Put 
the meat close to the fire for five minutes, then draw it further 
away. This is to close up the pores of the meat and keep the 
gravy in. Baste it frequently ; see that it does not bum. If in 
ft Dutch oven turn it from time to time, so that it is equally done. 
Some roast meats are stuffed. 

Stuffing. — Veal, heart, rabbit, .and chicken, are stuffed with 
the following: One tablespoonful of bread crambs, one of 
chopped suet, half of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of lemon- 
thyme and marjoram, a little pepper and salt, mixed together 
with an egg or a little milk. Pork, geese, and ducks are stuffed 
with sage and onions as follows : — Boil two onions half an hour, 
lay a thick slice of bread in the water five minutes, drain them 
very dry, chop them finely with a teaspoonful of chopped sage 
leayes, pepper and salt to taste. 

To Make Qravy for Roast Meat. — Take any bones, scraps of 
cold meat, or trimmings of the joint, put them in a half pint of 
water with a little salt and half an onion, let them stew all the 
time the meat is roasting : colour with a little bivxral^w^a. '^V'Wi.

meat. If the gravy is liked thick put a dessertspoonfnl of flour, 
mixed into a smooth paste with two of cold water into the sauce- 
pan five minutes before you strain it 

To Roast a Heart in a Stewpan. — Clean and trim off the deaf 
ears, and soak in warm water to draw out the blood. Stuff it 
with veal stuffing, fasten it up, put it in a stewpan with two 
ounces of dripping over a very slow fire, or on a hot plate, baste 
frequently and turn over occasionally. A bullock's heart takes 
two hours, and a calf's heart one hour. Make a gp^vy of the 
trimmings ; a quarter of an hour before rerving pour away the 
fat from the heart and pour the gravy in. 

Yorkshire Pudding. — To every quarter of a pound of flour 
allow one ^ig and half a pint of milk. Break the t.^% into the flour 
and mix quite smoothly with a little of the milk ; beat it well, let 
there be no lumps in it ; add the remainder of the milk by 
degrees ; put the pudding tin under the meat to catch some drip- 
ping, then pour in the pudding and bake half an hour. 

Suet Pudding. — Chop fine half a pound of suet, mix it with one 
pouTjd of flour, one teaspponful of baking powder, and a pinch of 
salt ; make it into a stiff dough with cold water or milk. Dip a 
pudding cloth in boiling water, dredge well with flour, put in 
the pudding, tie it securely, but leave it room to swell. Boil in 
plenty of water one hour and a half. Or grease a pint and a 
half basin and put it in, tie a cloth over and boil two hours. 

Norfolk Dumplings. — Mix half a pound of flour with half a 
teaspoonful of baking powder and a pinch of salt, make into a 
light dough with cold water ; form mto small balls, put them 
into boiling water immediately, and boil for twenty minutes. 

Materials required for Lesson : — A joint, I heart, lO oz. of 
suet, \<<\\Xi. of flour, \ pint of milk, 2 eggs, baking powder, a 
small bunch of herbs, two sprigs of parsley, pepper, salt, and 
bread, 

THIRD LESSON. 

BOILING, 

To Boil Meat. — To keep all the goodness in the meat it is 

essential to put it into boiling water sufficient to cover it, to draw 

the saucepan or pot to the side of the fire, and let it simmer 

gently all the time it is cooking. When you boil meat to get the 

goodness out, as in soups and broths, it is put into cold water and 

2^rjr gradually brought to the boil. Allow a t\\x«ttct o^ mvVqvxt 

«ac/i pound and a quarter of an lioui ovex, fox Xi^cl «cA 



APPENDIX, 107 



mutton ; veal and pork want twenty minutes to the pound. 
Boiled meats are not stuffed. Vegetables that are eaten with 
boiled meats are generally boiled with them ; this is a good plan, 
as both are improved ; but cabbage must always be excepted as 
it gives a strong flavour to anything boiled with it. The liquor 
in which meat has been boiled should never be thrown away as it 
can be made into many nice soups. Sauces or gravies of boiled 
meat are always poured over them. Boil salt beef with carrots 
and turnips. The carrot cut in four takes one hour to boil, 
and the turnip half an hour. Always keep the saucepan in 
which meat is boiling well skimmed. 

Rabbit and Pickled Pork. — Ostend rabbits are cheaper than 
English ones. They come over skinned and cleaned. Eng- 
lish rabbits require skinning and paunching. Wash the rabbit 
well in cold water, cut oif the legs at the 6rst joint, clear 
out all the blood from the head and neck, truss it into a proper 
shape, put it into boiling water, and let it boil gently for 
one hour, if a large one ; forty minutes will cook a small one. 
Pickled pork to eat with rabbit is boiled in the same saucepan. 
A thin piece of four pounds will be done in an hour, but a leg 
of pork weighing eiglit pounds will take three hours. Wash it 
and scrape it and put into the boiling water with the skin upper- 
most. Keep it well skimmed. Pease pudding is generally served 
with boiled pork, or in summer-time beans. Boiled rabbit is 
served with parsley and butter or onion sauce. 

Tripe. — Wash it clean and put it on to boil in plenty of water 
with four or six onions. Boil one hour and a half, strain off all 
the liquor, mash the onions, pour in a cupful of milk thickened 
with a dessertspoonful of flour, pepper and salt to taste, and a 
piece of butter the size of a nut ; mix all well together and boil 
ten minutes. 

Cow-heel. — Get a ready-dressed cow-heel, put it on in a pint 
and a half of milk with an onion in it ; let it boil till the bones 
will slip out. The milk strained and sweetened is very nourishing 
hot or cold for children. The heel is eaten with a little parsley 
and butter made as follows : — Put half an ounce of butter into 
a little saucepan to melt, stir smoothly into it a quarter of an 
ounce of flour, pour into it by degrees a quarter of a pint of the 
liquor in which the meat was boiled (or plain water), stir till 
it boils, move it to the side of the fire, chop a teaspoonful of 
parsley, washed and driedy stir into it, and serve d\.t«.Q.vV?^*

io8 APPENDIX. 



FOURTH LESSON. 

SOUPS AND BROTHS, 

Soups can be made of anjrthing and everything that is eatable ; 
the most sinewy, scraggy pieces of meat, the heads, tails, and feet 
of animals — because they contain the most gelatine — make good 
soup. So (for the same reason) do bones, both of fish and 
animals ; and vegetables alone make very good soup. If you 
have any pot liquor, ue,, liquor in which meat, or even suet 
puddings, or carrots and turnips, not greens^ have been boiled, 
use it to make your soup instead of water. In making soups 
three things are specially to be borne in mind. i»t. T^ scum 
must be taken off before it boils, or it will boil down and 
thicken the soup. All the fat should be taken off. 2nd. Sim- 
mer very softly ; if soup boils rapidly it spoils. 3rd. Never let 
soup get cold in the saucepan, turn it out into a shallow pan 
and do not cover it. 

Bone Soup. — Take three pounds of bones, cooked or un- 
cooked, pieces of meat, or scraps or trimmings, put them on 
with four pints of water ; when near boiling throw in a dessert- 
spoonful of salt to raise the scum, skim it well. When it boils 
put in two carrots, two turnips, one parsnip, a bunch of herbs, a 
blade of mace, and fifteen peppercorns. Let it simmer gently 
two hours. Strain it and return to the saucepan with the vege- 
tables cut in slices, and thicken it with corn-flour, or common 
flour, in the proportion of one dessertspoonful to a pint Colour 
if liked with burnt sugar. 

Ox-tail. — Cut the tails in joints, flour them and fry brown in 
a little dripping, with half an onion cut in rings. Pour off the 
dripping and put in four pints of cold water. When near boiling 
add half a teaspoonful of salt, skim well, put in a bunch of herbs 
and ten peppercorns. Let it simmer four hours. 

Leg of Beef Soup. — Take four or five pounds of leg of beef> 
cut off the meat, break the bone and take out the marrow, fry 
the meat in it a light brown, put in one pint of water and let it 
boil, throw in a dessertspoonfiil of salt, skim, and let it boil fifteen 
minutes ; then put in five pints of water, two onions, one turnip, 
one carrot, half^ a head of celery, a bunch of herbs, ten pepper^ 
corns, and ten alspice berries. Let it simmer slowly five hours. 

Carrot, Onion, and Potato Soups. — Boil six carrots, two or 
h^'^t^ ^''^^ on/ons, and three ounces of dripping, with a bunch of 
^ erfiy, u Jen f of celery, haJfa, pansnip, and n tunaip m icNw «^%xVk 
nrater or pot liquor an hour and a haU. Take out \)[ie caxiWfc, 



APPENDIX, 109 



pass them through a colander, strain the soup to ihem, season to 
taste, boil five minutes and serve. Onion soup is made the same 
way, only reversing the proportions of onions and carrots. For 
potato soup, which is very good, the potatoes are boiled or 
steamed separately, then mashed and added to the strained soup ; 
four pounds would be required for four quarts of soup. All 
vegetable soups are best eaten the day they are made. 

Haricot Puree. — Soak one pint of beans all night, boil them 
four hours in two quarts of water, with an onion sliced, pass them 
through a sieve or colander, season to taste, add one pint of milk, 
let it boil five minutes and serve. 

Materials required for Lesson : — I oxtail, 4 or 5 lbs. of leg 
of beef^ 4 lbs. of bones, 12 onions, i bunch of carrots, \ of 
turnips, 2 parsnips, herbs, \ head of celery, 4 lbs. of potatoes, 
I pt. of haricots, \ lb. of flour, J of an oz. each of peppercorns 
mace, and allspice, J lb. of dripping, i pt. of milk, pepper 
and salt 

FIFTH LESSON. 

STEWS, 

Stews are at once the simplest and most economical of all wa3rs 
of cooking, for whatever goodness is taken out of the meat in the 
cooking we get in the gravy, and the mo-t inferior parts of meat, 
properly stewed, are palatable and nourishing. Stews can be 
made either in saucepans or stone jars, cooked on the hob or in 
the oven ; in the latter case the vegetables are put in with the 
meat in the cold water ; in the former they are added when it 
comes to the boil, never between the two points. They are 
flavoured with carrots, onions, herbs, &c., and thickened with 
rice, barley, sago, flour, and potatoes. Stews must only simmer ; 
they are spoilt by boiling. 

Beef^laMode. — An ox-cheek, a cow-heel, six onions, three 
carrots, one ounce of dripping, flour, pepper and salt. Cut the 
cheek up, flour the pieces well, and put them with the dripping 
into a saucepan to brown ; cut up the vegetables and the cow- 
heel and put into the saucepan with cold water, one pint to a 
pound, season to taste, cover c'ose, and let it simmer for three 
hours. Thicken the gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour 
mixed with one of ketchup and one of water into a smooth paste. 

Brazilian Stew. — This stew is made by dipping inferior ijarta 
of beef or mutton into vinegar — ^NvVv\cVv\v«.'&>i5wt'^H»«t ^ ^sfxssc^-

aip each piece into vinegar, put them with four onions, two 
carrots, two turnips, pepper and salt into a saucepan, without any 
water, and let it simmer very gently three or four hours. 

Giblets. — Wash and pick two sets of chicken's or duck*s gib- 
lets, scald the wings, heads, and feet to get the feathers off and 
the skin and claws oflF the feet, roll them in flour ; put the gizzards 
on first in half a pint of water with* an onion, six peppercorns, 
and a little salt ; when they have stewed an hour put in the rest 
of the giblets, with one pint more water and a bunch of herbs : 
let them stew another hour. 

Mutton Haricot. — Cut the neck or scrag of mutton into chops, 
fry them in a little dripping with one onion cut in thin slices, 
pour off the dripping, and put in one pint of water thickened 
with a tablespoonful of flour, one carrot, and one turnip cut in 
slices, cover close and let it stew one hour. 

Ragout of Rabbit. — Wash and clean a good-sized Ostend 
rabbit ; boil the liver and heart, chop them and mix with veal 
stuffing, fill the rabbit, sew it up, and tie it into shape. Put a 
piece of fat beef and one pound of bacon, cut in slices, into a 
saucepan with one ounce of dripping, put in the rabbit to brown, 
turning it over to brown both sides, pour off the dripping, and 
put in one quart of water. Let it simmer gently an hour and a 
half. A quarter of an hour before serving skin off all the fat 
and thicken the gravy with a little corn-flour ; season with pepper 
and salt, and, if liked, stew a bunch of herbs and half an onion 
with it. Lay the rabbit on a dish, with the bacon round it, and 
pour the gravy over. 

Materials required for Lesson : — Ox-cheek, cow-heel, shin of 
beef, neck of mutton, rabbit, herbs, parsley, vinegar, dripping, 
flour, ketchup, bacon, giblets, onions, carrots, and turnips. 



SIXTH LESSON. 

BAKING, 

Baking is not the most economical way of cooking joints of 
meat ; but as it requires very little attention, and is very savoury, 
it is a favourite mode with many people. The best way of 
baking meat, is enclosing it in crust, it makes a little meat go a 
long way. 

Baked Pork. — We cut the rind of the pork through with a 
sharp knife at regular distances ; stuff U wilh sage and onions, 
and put it in a dish in the oven. Potatoes ox \>att« ^\3i^^\xv!^, 
#^ better baked under any other meat t\vaiv i^oxV. TMm \\ 



APPENDIX lU 



about in the oven that every part gets equally baked, and allow 
twenty minutes to the one pound for pork, and fifteen for beef or 
mutton. Baste frequently, and when it is done, put it on a hot 
dish ; and pour all the dripping out of the baking dish and pour 
a little boiling water, and stir it round to make gravy, which 
pour round, not over the meat Apple sauce is eaten with roast 
pork. 

Poor Man's Goose. — Wash a pig's fry and dry it well in a cloth, 
cut the liver and heart into slices ; flour it and lay it in a baking 
dish, season it with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of chopped 
sage leaves, and one onion chopped fine, pour in a gill of water, 
cover it with the caul, and bake three-quaiters of an hour in a 
moderate oven. 

Toad in the Hole. — Six ounces of flour, one ^gg^ one pint of 
milk, a pinch of salt. Break the ^^^ into the flour, stir in the 
milk by degrees, so as not to get it lumpy. Lay your meat or 
ox kidney cut in slices in a greased tin or pie-dish, pour the 
batter over and bake one hour to one and a quarter. Batter is 
better for standing before it is cooked. 

Meat Pie. — Make a crust of three quarters of a pound of 
flour, three quarters of a teaspoonful of baking powder, and 
quarter of a pound of dripping, with a pinch of salt. Rub the 
dripping into the flour, mix in the baking powder and salt ; 
make into a paste with one gill and a half of water, or enough 
to make a stiff paste (this depends on the quality of the flour). 
Flour your board, rolling-pin, and hands ; roll your paste a 
little larger than your pie-dish ; cut your meat in slices, lay it 
in season with pepper and salt, fill two-thirds with water ; cut 
a strip off your crust to lay on the edge of the dish, wet the 
edges, lay your crust on, trim it neatly round, decorate with the 
remains of the pastry, and bake one and a half hours. Two 
pounds of meat will fill a quart dish. 

Cornish Pasties. — The crust the same as the last, or made 
with suet in the same manner, rolled very thin, divided into 
pieces about eight inches square. On each piece put one ounce 
of meat and one ounce of potato seasoned, fold and pinch the 
edges together, and bake on greased tins one hour. 

Baked Apple-dumplings. — Same crust as above ; peel six

SEVENTH LESSON. 

FRYING, 

Frying is simply boiling in fat. It is not economicnl, but as 
it is very expeditious, owing to the fat attaining a greater heat 
than water, and so cooking anything put into it, in a very short 
time, it is very useful, though it is very seldom properly done. 
The great art in frying is to have the fat hot enough, and to 
have the article fried immersed in the fat, if not the fried food is 
always sodden and greasy. It is not wasteful to use a large 
quantity of fat in frying, as the same fat will do over and over 
again by occasionally melting it, and pouring it into cold water, 
when the impurities sink to the bottom. When anything fried 
is taken out of the fat it should be laid on whitey*brown paper 
to drain for a few minutes. 

Sausages. — Sausages, should be pricked in two or three 
places before they are put in the fiying-pan, to prevent their 
bursting. They are fried dry, as it is csdled, i.e. without being 
plunged in boilmg fat. Put an ounce of dripping into the 
frying-pan, when it boils put in the sausages. Move them to 
get brown all round. Seven minutes on a good fire will do 
them. Serve on a piece of fried bread, or mashed potatoes. 

Liver and Bacon. — Wash your liver, but do not soak it 
Wipe it dry, cut it in'thin slices, and flour each piece. Cut the 
rind off the bacon, and cut it into thin rashers. Fry the bacon 
first ; and put it on a hot dish before the fire while you fry the 
liver in the fat, which came from the bacon. When the liver is 
done lay it on the bacon ; mix a dessertspoonful of flour smooth 
with a cup-full of water, add a pinch of pepper and salt, pour it 
into the frying-pan, stir over the fire till it boils, and strain over 
the liver and bacon. 

Tripe. — Tripe is cut into pieces about three inches square, and 
dipped into a batter made of six ounces of flour, one table- 
spoonful of oil, or one ounce of butter, half a pint of tepid 
water. Mix the oil with the flour, add the water by degrees; 
whip the whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, stir into the batter, 
dip the tripe in, throw it into a saucepan of boiling fat, let it fry 
three or four minutes, take it out and drain. 

FHttcra.—Are slices of meat, or fruit, or cake dipped in 
Aauer and fried the same way.

^ut/n slices or ribbons, are fried by tl^rowingtViem\iito\>o>ka^\aX. 



APPENDIX. 113 



Pancakes. — Pancakes are made with four ounces of flour, 
half a pint of milk, and one egg mixed smoothly. A piece of 
lard or dripping the size of a nut is put into the pan for each 
pancake. I'his quantity makes six. 

Omelets. — Omelets are made by beating up two eggs with a 
dessertspoonful of sugar for sweet omelets, or for savoury with 
chopped herbs, parsley, onion, or bacon ; put half an ounce of 
butter into the pan, pour in the omelet, stir till set, and fold in 
half. Omelet soufflee is made by beating the whites of the 
eggs to a froth and mixing with the other ingredients. 

Materials required for Lesson : — I lb. of sausages, I lb. of 
liver, I oz. of butter, \ lb. of bacon, 4 lb. of tripe, i lb. of 
fat, 2 apples, i potato, } lb. of flour, 8 eggs, \ a pint of milk, 
parsley. 



EIGHTH LESSON. 

BROILING, 

Broiling is one of the most difficult ways of cooking meat. It 
requires a clear fire, no smoky coals ; no fork should go into 
the meat to let the juices out. Well broiled meats are very 
easy of digestion. The bars of the gridiron should alwa3rs be 
rubbed with suet or fat, to prevent the meat sticking. When 
the fire is not clear, broiling is often done in front of the fire, but 
the flavour of meat broiled over the fire is superior. Broiling 
is adapted for small slices of meat or fish ; when chickens are 
bro'led they are split in half. Fish is often broiled wrapped in 
buttered paper. 

Steak.— -A steak or a fillet from the leg of mutton should be 
peppered on both sides, and broiled for five minutes on each 
side. A warm plate should be ready for it, on which has been 
mixed half an ounce of butter, one teaspoon ful of chopped 
parsley, a little salt. This is called mattre cChttel butter. 

Mutton Chop. — A chop takes the same time ; this generally 
has a teaspoonful of ketchup, and a piece of butter the size of a 
nut, with a pinch of pepper and salt put on it when it is taken 
from the gridiron. A chump chop is the most ecoTicyKCkKaJv. 

Kidney, — Kidneys are split and sVewet^^ o^etv, ^e^ xfts^^^ 
thorough cooking; bullocVs kidney c^axVw o\^Tv\^'v«\'a^^'^'^ 
of butter is laid on them when taketiYxoTcv Ocve ^ndAxofi. 



1 14 APPENDIX. 



Sprats. — These should be washed and rubbed dry in a cloth, 
a skewer should be run through the eyes of six or eight to 
prevent their falling into the fire, and to enable you to turn them 
all at once. Dried herrings are split down and opened flat, the 
inside is broiled first, then the outside. 

Veal Cutlet. — Veal cutlet for broiling is cut into nice-shaped 
pieces, a little butter is melted on a plate, pepper and salt is 
added, each piece is dipped in, and then in bread crumbs (to 
which some people add a little chopped parsley and herbs or 
lemon rind). They require ten minutes over a good fire. When 
they are dished, a squeeze of lemon over them is a great im- 
provement. 

Bacon. — Bacon is best broiled or rather toasted in front of the 
fire, the rashers should be thin, and the rind cut off. The fat 
which drops from bacon should never be wasted. All broiled 
meats should be eaten as soon as they are done ; off the grid- 
iron on to the plate is the way to get them in perfection. 

Mushrooms. — The only vegetable broiled is the mushroom. 
You must be very careful to get a wholesome one ; peel it care- 
fully, grease the bars of the gridiron ; lay your mushroom on 
with the stalk uppermost, do not turn it ; in seven minutes it 
will be full of delicious ketchup, which you must be careful 
not to spill in taking off. 

Materials required for Lesson : — I lb. of steak, I chop, I 
kidney, sprats or herring, i lb. of veal cutlet, \ lb. of bacon, 
1 4 oz. of butter, i lemon, bread, parsley. 



NINTH LESSON. 

USING UP COLD MEAT, 

It is an expensive meal to have a dinner of cold meat and 
pickles. It is not so satisfying as a hot one ; in other words, our 
bodies don't get the same amount of nourishment out of it. In 
warming up cold meat, it should not be overheated as it does 
not require to be cooked any more. 

Hash. — Hash is too often tough meat served up in greasy 

gravy. Cut your meat all off the bones ; put them on with a 

pint of water for an hour or two, with an onion, half a canot, 

Aalf a, turnip, and a bunch of herbs to make gravy. Roll your 

fj'^^^ ^^ /neat in flour, strain your gravy on to iKem, and let 

JAem Just come to tbe boil. Add a tablespooiaXxA ol V^lOwa^, 

^"^ ^^ ^^o pickled walnuts chopped up. 



APPENDIX. 115 



Shepherd*s Pie. — Cut up any scraps of cold meat, season to 
taste, sprinkle over a few nne herbs, put them in a pie-dish, pour 
over a little water. Mash some potatoes with halt a gill of hot 
milk, in which half an ounce of butter is melted. Cover your 
pie with them, and bake half an hour. 

Rissoles of Cold Meat. — Two tablespoonsful of cold meat 
chopped fine, one of suet, two of bread crumbs, half a tab'e- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, and half of dried herbs, pepper 
and salt to taste, half an ^g%. Mix all together, roll into balls, 
egg and bread crumb, and iry a light brown. 

Meat Patties. — Three quarters of a pound of flour, a quarter 
of a pound of dripping, one teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Mix into a stiff paste. Roll out a quarter of an inch thick. 
Grease your patty-pans, line with paste ; put in cold meat cut 
up neatly, seasoned with pepper and salt, and herbs, cover with 
crust, trim the edges neatly round, and bake half an hour. 

Goblet Pie. — Scraps of cold meat two ounces, apples chopped 
two ounces, suet two ounces, raisins two ounces, currants two 
ounces, sugar two ounces. Mix, put into a pie dish, and cover 
with a crust made as above. 

Curry. — Fry an onion, cut in slices, and an apple finely 
chopped in two ounces of dripping, then add slices of cold meat, 
mix a dessertspoonful of curry powder, and one of flour in half 
a pint of water ; pour it over the meat, shake it over the fire till 
it boils. 

Materials required for Lesson : — Cold meat, carrot, onions, 
turnip, herbs, parsley, I lb. of potatoes, \ lb. of dripping, \ lb. 
of suet, bread, 3 apples, i^ lb. of flour, curry powder, i oz. of 
butter, I ^%gt 2 oz. of raisins, 2 oz. of currants,* 2 oz. of moist 
sugar, and 4 oz. of curry powder. 



TENTH LESSON. 
AUSTRALIAN MEAT. 

Australian meat being already overcooked in the process of pre- 
serving, great care must be taken to cook it as little as possible. 

Meat Pie. — Make a crust of three-quarters of a pound of flour, 
and one quarter of a pound of dripping, and tVkxt^rojajwx&vs. ^ "a.

cover, and bake half an hour. This can be made into a pudding 
in a quart basin. 

Brown Stew. — Fry a little chopped onion in one ounce of 
dripping, stir in half an ounce of flour, and mix smoothly with 
half a pint of water. Lay in one pound of Australian meat cut 
in slices, and a teaspoonful of chopped herbs. Let it warm 
through, and serve. 

Mince Meat with Mashed Potato. — Take one and a half pound 
of potatoes boiled and mashed with half a gill of milk, with half an 
ounce of butter melted in. Build a wall round the dish. Mince 
half a pound of Australian meat very fine, warm it up in a 
saucepan with a tablespoonful of ketchup or gravy, and a piece 
of butter the size of a nut, season to taste, and put it in the 
middle. 

Irish Stew. — Boil one pound of potatoes and four good-sized 
onions half an hour, drain off the water, and mash them. Lay 
in slices of Australian meat seasoned to taste, and let it simmer 
fifteen minutes. Mind it does not bum. 

Rissoles of Australian Meat. — Make a crust of half a pound 
of flour, half a teaspoonful of baking powder, and a quarter of 
a pound of dripping, with sufficient water to make a stiff paste. 
Roll it thin, cut it into rounds the size of a breakfast cup. Jay a 
little minced meat well seasoned on each, fold the edges together, 
pinch them to make them stick, egg and bread crumb, and fry 
in hot fat. 

Mulligatawny Soup. — Pour over two pounds of Australian 
meat two quarts of warm water. Fry a carrot, a turnip, two 
onions and two apples in a little fat, pour over them half a pint 
of the liquor from the meat, boil till reduced to one gill. Make 
a paste of one tablespoonful of curry powder, two of flour, and 
a little water, stir in, add a spoonful of salt and half of sugar, 
the meat, and the liquor. Let it simmer two hours, strain, and 
put into it a two-pound tin of calf s head. In opening a tin of 
Australian meat, only remove the fat from the part you are 
going to use. The fat put into boiling water to clarify it is very 
good for pie-crusts. 

Materials required for Lesson : — 6 lb. tin of Australian meat» 
7.\ lb. of potatoes, 6 onions, \ lb. of dripping, baking powder, 
I oz, of butter, 4 gill of milk, I J lb. of flour, carrot, turnip, 
apples, curry powder, calfs head, X lb, of fat for frying. 



APPENDIX, 117 



ELEVENTH LESSON. 

FISH, 

Boiling fish is by no means so savoury or so satisfying as any 
other way of cooking it ; but it is generally adopted for cod, 
brill, and salmon. Very oily fish, such as salmon, mackerel, 
eels, are also fre<|uently boiled. Salt cod is always boiled ; but 
as the goodness is nearly all taken out in the salting and the 
soaking, salt cod is by no means a cheap food, even if it costs 
very little money. Fish should be put into boiling water suf- 
ficient to cover it, the saucepan should then be moved to the side 
of the fire and kept just below boiling point until the fish is 
done, which is shown by its leaving the bone, and the fins or 
tail pulling out easily. 

To Bake a Haddock. — Clean it carefully, scrape the scales 
off, and stuif it with half a tablespoonfiil of chopped parsley, one 
quarter of herbs, and one tablespoonful of bread crumbs worked 
together with a bit of butter, and seasoned to taste. Sew up the 
fish. Rub it over with a little melted butter or dripping, roll it 
in bread crumbs, lay on a greased tin, and bake from half to 
three quarters of an hour. Any fish can be done the same way, 
proportioning the quantity of stuffing and the time of cooking 
to the size of the fish. 

Fried Fish. — Large fish when fried are cut in fillets, small 
fish are fried whole. Fish is either egged and rolled in bread 
crumbs, or dipped in batter made of flour and water, before it is 
fried. 

Grilled Fish. — Mackerel, herring, pilchards, and dried salmon 
are generally grilled. The gridiron bars must be greased, and 
the fish peppered before it is put on. When it is done, a 
little salt and, if liked, a small piece of butter is put on. Fish 
is very delicate wrapped in greased writing paper to broil. 

Potted Fish. — Cut fresh herrings or mackerel in thick pieces, 
pack them in a stone jar with plenty of peppercorns, a blade of 
mace, a shallot, a pinch of salt, a bay leaf, a gill of vinegar. 
Tie the lid down, and let them cook several hours in a very slow 
oven. They are well cooked if left in a baker's oven all night.

TWELFTH LESSON. 

VEGETABLES, 

Potatoes. — How to cook a potato. Potatoes vary very 
greatly in quality. Some potatoes are best boiled, and some 
steamed ; some do best cooked in their skins, and some require 
peeling first ; some cook in twenty minutes, some in thirty ; 
some will only bake. As a general rule, it is more economical 
to boil potatoes in their skins ; but they must be boiled gently, 
and the water strained off directly they are done, for if they 
break in the water there is great waste. The skins must be care- 
fully scrubbed quite clean before they are boiled. When potatoes 
are very old they acquire an unpleasant taste if boiled in their 
skins. Potatoes must never boil hard. Potatoes are best put into 
cold water with plenty of salt in. New potatoes are put into 
boiling water ; they take longer to boil than old potatoes. 
Potatoes take longer to steam than to boil. They take about 
an hour to bake. To see if they are done run a fork in. 

Greens, Savoys, and Cabbages must be boiled in plenty of 
water, with a tablespoonful of salt to every half-gallon. They 
must be kept well stirred down, and if boiled with the lid off 
will want no soda to keep them green, unless the water is very 
hard. The time required to cook them depends upon their age. 
The stalk should be split up, so that it gets done as soon as the 
green part. 

Peas want plenty of water with salt in ; soda makes their 
outer skin crack. They take from fifteen to thirty minutes. 

French Beans are split or sliced, and, if old, strung before 
boiling. Boil with the lid off. 

Carrots, Turnips, Parsnips and Spanish Onions. — Carrots 
are scraped, turnips peeled thickly to get below the woody fibre, 
parsnips peeled thin or scraped. These roots are generally 
boiled with meat. If boiled alone, put two ounces of salt to 
a gallon of water. When put into boiling water, parsnips, 
onions, and carrots take over an hour, turnips halif an hour. 
Turnips are generally mashed. 

Spinach wants well washing, and then it is packed closely into 
a saucepan and boiled in its own juices. When tender, it is 
squeezed dry, chopped fine, returned to the saucepan, and 
warmeA up with a little piece of butter. 

CauiiiJower must he soaked in salt and water to get out cater- 
pi/Jani, &c. Put it into boiling water, and Vk>\\ tiaro VweoX.'^ \<ci 
^^ir/r minutes. Melted butter is generally eaXeiv ^^^\\.. 



APPENDIX, 119 



Materials required for Lesson : — Cauliflower, 2 lbs. of pota- 
toes, greens or cabbage, peas, beans, 2 oz. of butter, i lb. 
of spinach, 2 carrots, 2 turnips, 2 parsnips, 2 Spanish onions, 
i lb. of salt. 

THIRTEENTH LESSON. 

PIES AND BAKED PUDDINGS, 

Fruit Pie. — Pie-crust is made either shbrt or flaky according 
to the way the fat, whether it be butter, lard, suet, or dripping, 
is put into the flour. For short crust, it is rulobed into the flour 
before the flour is wetted ; for flaky, it is rolled in afterwards. 
Short crust is the easiest for beginners. Take half a pound 
of flour, mix with it half a teaspoonfal of baking powder, and 
rub lightly into it a quarter of a pound of butter, or dripping, 
or lard. (Suet crust is better for boiling ; but is not good to eat 
cold.) Wet it with sufficient cold water to make a stiff paste ; 
the quantity required depends on the quality of the flour. Roll 
it out two inches larger than the pie-dish it is to cover, fill the 
dish with fruit, put four tablespoomuls of moist sugar to a quart 
of fruit. For dry fruit, as apples, and plums, and green goose- 
berries, put in half a gill of water ; juicy fruit requires none. 
Cut a strip all round your paste to lay on the edge of your pie- 
dish, moisten it slightly, lay on your cover, press the edges 
together, trim them neatly, sprinkle a little water over the top, 
grate a little sugar over, and bake half an hour in a moderate 
oven. This crust womld be made richer by mixing the yolk of 
an egg with the water, and commoner by using only one- third 
as much lard or dripping as flour, instead of half. 

Patties. — Put half a pound of flour into a basin, mix in half 
a teslspoonful of baking powder, mix it into a stiff paste with 
cold water (half the yolk of an egg with it makes it ridier), flour 
your board and pin, roll it out very thin, spread a quarter of a 
pound of butter, lard, or dripping on, as if spreading bread and 
butter, sprinkle a little flour on it, cut it in eight, lay the pieces 
on the top of each other, flour the edges, roll it out again, fold 
it, roll it out one-third of an inch thick, grease your patty pans, 
cut rounds of paste a little larger, lay them in, fill them with 
meat cut in dice and seasoned to taste, sprinkle a little water on, 
cover, press the edges together, trim neatly, and if you have an 
egg broken, brush them over with it. This flak^ ^T>a&\. pss^Xsfc.

plums and chop them, wash, dry, and pick a quarter of a pound 
of currants, two ounces of peel and two ounces of moist sugar 
and a pinch of mixed spice, mix into a stiff paste with one ^^ 
beaten up in a gill or more of milk. It should be so stiff a 
spoon will stand up in it. Bake in a greased tin one hour. 

Baked Custard. — ^To the yolks of four ^jgs beaten lightly with 
a little sugar pour one pint of boiling milk, flavour to taste, line 
a dish with a little piece of pie-crust, pour in the custard, and 
bake three-quarters of an hour. A common one can be made 
of two whole eggs. 

Bread Pudding. — Soak half a pound of pieces of bread in 
cold water, any crusts however stale will do, if you cut off the 
burnt, provided they are not mouldy. Squeeze them dry, and 
pour on them one quart of boiling milk. Cover, and let them 
swell. ' Beat up two eggs with two ounces of sugar, stir into 
the pudding, put in a quarter of a pound of plums or currants. 
Bake in a greased dish half on hour. This pudding can be 
boiled in a buttered basin. Time required two hours. 

Sago, Tapioca, or Rice Pudding. — Soak two tablespoonfuls 
in a pint of milk, put it on to boil, stirring it to prevent its 
sticking ; mix in (off the fire) one egg and one tablespoonful of 
sugar. Bake in a greased dish. 

Materials required for Lesson : — § qtn. flour, \ lb. of butter,

FOURTEENTH LESSON. 

BOILED PUDDINGS, 

Boiled puddings are generally shortened or made light with 
suet. Where people cannot eat suet, butter may be used in its 
place. Boiled puddings are lighter if boiled in a cloth, but 
easier to keep m shape if boiled in a basin { but they require 
a longer time to boil. It is most essential to keep a pudding 
cloth clean ; it should be washed in two or three hot waters 
without soap immediately it is done with, wrung dry, and dried 
off quickly, or it will get a musty taste. Always put the sauce- 
pan of water on to boil before you begin to make a pudding. 

Meskt Pudding. — A quart basin holds two pounds of meat ; 

i« pound and a half of steak or beef skirts and half a pound of 

Sidney makes a good padding. Make a ciusX o£ half a pound

water to make a stiff paste. Cut off one-third for the cover. 
Roll the rest to a round twice the size of the top of the basin, 
grease the basin, and lay it neatly in. Fill it with the meat cut 
in slices, and seasoned with i^pper and salt, pour in a little 
water, wet the edges of the paste, roll out the cover the proper 
size, lay it on, press the edges together, trim neatly. Dip the 
clotii in boiling water, flour it, tie it on, tie up the edges, and put 
it in boiling water. Let the pudding boil two hours and a 
half. It can be made commoner with one- third suet, or even 
a quarter instead of half. 

Batter and Black Cap Puddin|r9..^£ight ounces of fk>ur, half 
a teaspoonful of baking powder, two eggs, a pint of milk. Mix 
the flour with the baking powder and a pinch of salt. Break 
the eggs into a cup, beat them lightly with a little of the milk, 
mix them by degrees quite smoothly into the flour so that there 
are no lumps, add the rest of the milk, grease a basin, pour tha 
pudding in through a strainer, flour the cloth thickly after dip- 
ping it in boiling water, tie it securely, and boil gently for an 
hour and a half Black cap pudding is made by throwing in a 
quarter of a pound cA currants after the batter is in the basin. 

Fruit and Roly-poly Puddings. — ^The crust for these should 
be the same as for meat puddings. Allow a quarter of a pound 
of sugar to a quart of fruit. For roly-poly, roll the crust out 
thin, cover it with jam, treacle, or currants, apple,, and sugar ; 
roll it up, tie in a cloth securely at each end, and boil an hour 
and a half. 

Plum Pudding. — A quarter of a pound of suet chopped fine, 
a quarter of a pound of currants, a quarter of a pound of plums, 
a quarter of a pound of sugar, six ounces of flour, six ounces of 
bread crumbs, two ounces of peel, a gill of milk, two eggs, half 
a teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix thoroughly the dry things, 
beat the eggs lightly with the milk, add to them, dip a cloth in 
boiling water, flour it, tie in the pudding securely, leaving it room 
to swell, and boil two hours and a half. 

Treacle Pudding. — One pound of flour, a teaspoonful of 
baking powder, a quarter of a pound of suet chopped fine, a 
quarter of a pound of treacle, an egg; a gill and a half of milk. 
Mix the dry ingredients, stir the egg and milk into the treacle 
and mix with them, pour into a greased basin, tie a well-floured 
cloth over, and boil two hours.

FIFTEENTH LESSON. 

BREAD AND CAKES. 

Home-made bread is at once more wholesome, and more 
satisfying than baker's bread ; it keeps fresh a longer time, it is 
eatable at the end of a week, when baker's bread is very dry. 

To make a Quartern of Flour into Bread. — ^Take three pounds 
of flour, and put it into a dry pan. Mix one ounce of German 
yeast into a smooth paste with a little tepid water, and add by 
degrees more tepid water till you have a pint and three-quarters. 
Put a pinch of salt into a well in the middle of the flour, and 
strain it in gradually mixing it all smoothly into dough. Be 
careful not to leave dry lumps of flour. Sprinkle a little flour 
over, cover and set in a warm place for at least two hours to 
rise. Then turn it out on a well-floured board, and work in 
more flour. Make it into three loaves, bake on a well-floured 
tin, or in flat bread-tins. Half a pound of flour is required in 
making it up. In making large quantities of bread, only a 
small portion of the water is put in at flrst, and a small portion 
of the flour wetted, this is called setting or laying the sponge ; 
this rises for some hours, large batches are laid over-night ; 
when it has risen, more water is added, and the whole mixed 
up into dough ; potatoes are frequently added. 

Unfermented Bread. — Unfermented, or unleavened bread is 
not much used. It has the advantage of being very quickly 
made. Take one pound of flour ; mix thoroughly with it one 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and half a teaspoonful of salt. 
Mix it with cold water, sufficient to make it into a light Arm 
dough. Make it into two small loaves and bake immediately. 
Flour thus pre[)ared is sold as self-raising flour. 

Milk Rolls. — Rub two ounces of butter into one pound of 
self-raising flour, mix with milk into a light Arm dough and 
bake immediately. 

Plum Cake. — Eight ounces of flour, half a teaspoonful of 
baking powder, quarter of a poimd of fruit, either currants, 
plums, or sultanas, or mixed, two ounces of sugar, two ounces 
of dripping rubbed into the flour ; mix in the other ingredients ; 
heat up one ^gg with a little milk, mix with the other in- 
^edients ; cake should be so stiff a spoon would stand up in it.

SIXTEENTH LESSON. 
INVALID COOKERY. 

Invalid cookery is one of the mostlmportant and most neglected 
branches of the art. Good food is as essential to the sick as 
good physic ; many a valuable life has been lost for want of 
proper food during recovery from sickness. When necessary 
articles of diet for the sick room are to be given rests with the 
doctor ; in the earlier stages of illness, particularly fevers, little 
food is required, the patient loathes it, and to press beef-tea, 
&c., on a sick stomach, is positively injurious ; refreshing 
drinks are chiefly what the patient requires. Perfect cleanliness 
and freshness are most essential to invalid cookery. Don't 
make beef- tea, lemonade, &c, enough for two or three days, 
to save yourself trouble, and don't let the patient see you taste 
with a spoon, and put it into the food again. 

Beef Tea (Liebig's). — Chop a pound of lean beef as flcie a& 
sausage meat ; pour on it a pint of co\<i>Na.\jet,\e.\.\\. '5»Qk'5^\^xi&.

Mutton Broth. — Two pounds of scrag of mutton put into a 
saucepan with three pints of water and a little salt Let it 
simmer gently two hours. Strain through a sieve ; when cold 
remove every particle of fat ; it can be thickened with arrowroot 
or ground rice. The mutton is good to eat with parsley and 
butter. 

Toast and Water. — Toast a crust of bread till it is of a light 
brown on all sides ; plunge it into a pint of cold water, and let 
it stand covered half an hour. 

Irish or Iceland Moss. — Wash Irish moss, and let it soak all 
night ; dry it and boil it, one ounce in *a quart of water till 
reduced to one half. Strain through a sieve. Take the jelly 
with milk, or wine, flavoured to taste. The moss can be boiled 
in milk and put in a shape. 

Barley Water.- -Bojl one ounce of pearl barley in one quart 
of water twenty minutes, sweeten to taste. A second quart of 
water boiled with the same barley is better than the first A bit 
of lemon rind improves it 

Bran Tea. — Pour one quart of boiling water on three tables 
spoonfuls of middling sized bran, let it stand a quarter of an 
hour ; sweeten with sugar or honey.

till it thickens, then move it to the side of the fire. This recipe 
will never fail to produce good melted butter free firom lumps. 
If you cannot afford so much butter use less ; but never put 
more flour than butter. Melted butter too often resembles paste.

Irish Stew. — This is a way of economieing meat by cooking 
it with a large quantity of potatpes. It is best made of fat meat 
— the ends of the neck of mutton and the scrag do very 
well. Lay in a saucepan layers of mutton and potatoes an^ 
onions cut in slices, seasoned to taste, pour over a very little
