A WORD OF ADVICE, 



Eggs are not fit for any purpose unless they are perfectly fresh. 
An easy method of ascertaining the freshness of an ^g^ is to hold it 
toward the sun or toward a good light. If fresh, it will be perfectly 
clear; if it is clear on one side and cloudy on the other, it is stale. 
Another good test is to place the eggs in a pan filled with water; 
those that sink to the bottom are perfectly fresh; if they float at the 
top or stand on end in the water, they are unfit for use.

NOTES 



A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 

A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a tea- 
spoonful. 

The recipes referred to in the " One Hundred Ways of Cooking 
Eggs " will be found in the appendix.

Poached. 



Boil in a deep saucepan three quarts of water with a heavy pinch of 
salt and three drops of vinegar. Have easily at hand twelve fresh 
eggs. When, and only when, the water boils, rapidly but carefully 
crack six of them, one by one. As success to have them in proper 
shape and cooked to perfection depends upon how they are handled, 
special care should be taken to crack them as rapidly as possible, 
carefully avoiding to break the yolks, and dropping each one right on 
the spot where the water bubbles, and as near the boiling-point as 
possible. Poach for one minute and a quarter from the time that the 
water boils after the eggs were put in. Lift them up with a skimmer, 
lay them on the freshly prepared toasts, or use for any other desired 
purpose; and repeat the same with the other six. If handled strictly 
as above described you will have them to perfection, and no necessity 
of trimming any superfluous adherings; serve when required. 



2. Scrambled Eggs, 

Melt three ounces of butter in a saucepan, break into it twelve 
fresh eggs; season with a pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and a 
third of a pinch of grated nutmeg. Mix thoroughly without stopping 
for three minutes, using a spatula, and having the pan on a very hot 
stove. Turn into a warm tureen, add a little verjuice or lemon juice, 
and send to the table very hot. 



3. Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus Tops, 

To be prepared exactly the same as for No. 2. After the eggs 
hav€ been well mixed with butter in the pan, there is added a quarter 
of a bunch of freshly boiled asparagus-tops. 



10 



4- Scrambled Eggs with Truffles. 

Place in a saucepan four good-sized, sliced truffles with a glassful 
of Madeira wine. Reduce to about half, which will take two minutes; 
add a tablespoonful of butter; season with one pinch of salt and half 
a pinch of pepper. Crack into the saucepan twelve eggs, mix all well 
together with the spatula for three minutes on a very hot stove with- 
out stopping. Turn into a hot tureen and serve. 



5. Scrambled Eggs with Smoked Beef. 

Fry in a sautoire for one minute two ounces of finely minced 
smoked beef. Scramble twelve eggs as for No. 2, mixing with the 
above prepared beef. Any kind of garnishing may be added to the 
scrambled eggs. 



6. Scrambled Eggs with Chicory. 

Blanch for iifteen minutes a good-sized head of chicory; drain it 
and cut it into one-inch lengths. Put these in a saucepan on the hot 
stove with an ounce of butter and one minced onion, fry, and then 
moisten with half a pint of broth (No. loi), adding a pinch of salt and 
half a pinch of pepper. Let cook until all the liquid is evaporated 
(which will take from twenty to twenty-two minutes). Break twelve 
eggs into a saucepan, add the chicory and another ounce of butter, 
then scramble with a spatula all together for four minutes, and serve 
with heart-shaped bread croutons (No. 102) around the dish. 



12 



7- Eggs a la Livingston, 

Cover six pieces of cut toast with pate-de-foie-gras, lay them on a 
dish, and pour twelve scrambled eggs over (No. 2), add two table- 
spoonfuls of demi-glace around the dish and serve (No. 103). 

^ 8. Eggs a la Bourguignonne, 

Place in a saucepan one tablespoonf ul of meat-glaze with one pint 
of broth (No. loi). Boil, then crack into it two fresh eggs, and poach 
for one and a quarter minutes. Carefully lift up with a skimmer, and 
gently lay them on a hot silver dish. Repeat the same operation with 
ten more, two at a time; when all on the dish, sprinkle over them an 
ounce of grated Parmesan cheese. Place in the hot oven to brown for 
one minute. Reduce the gravy in which they were poached to one- 
half, then carefully pour the sauce around the eggs, but not over 
them, and serve hot. 

13 



V 



9- Fried Eggs. 

Place in a frying-pan on the hot range three tablespoonfuls of 
very good sweet oil, heat it well, then carefully break into it one 
fresh tgg^ being careful not to break the yolk, and with the aid of a 
table knife fold the white right over the yolk, cook for a quarter of a 
minute, turn it over with a cake-turner, cook for a quarter of a min- 
ute on the other side, lift it up with the cake-turner, dress on a hot 
dish with a folded napkin. Proceed precisely the same way with 
eleven more, and then they will be ready to serve for any purpose 
desired. 

N. B. — Mix one pinch of salt, and half a pinch of white pepper, 
and as soon as the eggs are dressed on the dish season each one 
evenly with it; taking special care to cook them separately, and no 
more than a quarter of a minute on each side. 



14 



\ 



lo. Eggs au Beurre Noir. 



Put one ounce of butter in a frying-pan on the hot stove, let heat 
well, but not brown; break gently into a dish twelve very fresh eggs, 
slide them carefully into the pan, then season with a pinch of salt and 
half a pinch of white pepper; let cook slowly for three minutes. Have 
ready a hot, flat dish, slide the eggs gently onto it, without turning 
them over, and be careful to avoid breaking them; lay the dish con- 
taining the eggs in a warm place. Put two ounces of butter in the 
same pan, place it on the hot stove, and let the butter get a good 
brown color for three minutes, then drop in two teaspoonfuls of vine- 
gar. Pour this over the eggs, and serve. 



15 



1 1 . Eggs au Soleil. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of lard in a frying-pan on the hot stove,

let them cook for two minutes, then with a skimmer take each one up 
separately and lay it carefully on a dry cloth. Have some fritter- 
batter (No. 104) ready, cut apiece of half-cooked bacon into small, 
square pieces of about an inch, and add them to the batter, then dip 
in the eggs, one after the other, taking up with each one a piece of 
the bacon, and with the fingers drop them into very hot grease, and 
cook to a good golden color for two minutes. Lift them up with the 
skimmer, lay them on a dry cloth to drain; sprinkle over half a pinch 
of salt, dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and se*-ve.

yolks for other purposes. Add to the vessel containing the sugar and 
yolks a light teaspoonful of vanilla essence: now with the wooden 
spatula, begin to beat the yolks with the sugar as briskly as you possi- 
bly can for fifteen minutes. Lay it aside. Then with the aid of a 
pastry wire-whip, beat up to a very stiff froth the twelve ^%% whites in

move the pastry wire-whip; take a skimmer in the right hand, and with 
the left take hold of the vessel containing the preparation of the yolks 
and sugar. Gradually pour it over the whites, and with the skimmer 



72 



gently mix the whole together for two minutes. The preparation will

lay the dish containing the omelet on another cold one, liberally sprin- 
kle powdered sugar over it, and immediately send to the table. 

N. B. — Special care should be taken when piling the preparation 
into the cold, silver dish: and the making of the incisions should be 
done as rapidly as possible, so that success will be certain. When 
desired, the vanilla essence can be substituted with the same quantity 
of orange-flower water.

hot range and stir until the cheese is thoroughly dissolved, then place 
the pan on the corner of the range to keep warm. Take six hard 
boiled shelled eggs. Cut each one into four even slices crosswise, 
season with a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonf ul of pepper equally 
divided. Lightly butter a silver dish. Arrange a very thin layer of 
the above garnishing over it. Take the sliced eggs and lay one slice 
on the dish, then a very small thin slice of Swiss cheese — then again 



82 



a slice of egg and a slice of cheese — always keeping them one over- 
lapping another, both eggs and cheese; continue the same with the 
rest, giving a crown shape around the dish. 

Pour half a gill of hot tomato sauce on top of both eggs and 
cheese, equally divided. Now pour the balance of the garnish- 
ing over all, also equally divided; lightly sprinkle the top with a very 
little clarified butter, and then place in a brisk oven for eight minutes, 
so that it should get a good brown color. Remove from out the oven 
and serve immediately.

79- Egg^ ^ l^ W, M. Evarts. 

Have six hard boiled shelled eggs, carefully cut away the third 
part of each t%g on the surface. Remove the yolks without breaking 
the whites, leave the whites on a plate until further action : thorough- 
ly mash the yolks in a bowl with a spoon; add ateaspoonful of grated 
Parmesan cheese, a tablespoonful of Allemande sauce (No. in), half 
a teaspoonful of Anchovy sauce. Season with one tablespoonful of 
salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper. Knead all well together, then 
fill the inside of the eggs with the preparation, and giving them an 
oval shape a quarter of an inch over the surface. Cut three of the six 
pieces into small strips lengthwise, a quarter of an inch thick, gently 



84 



lay one strip over each egg crosswise — right in the centre, so that, 
when completed, they will represent small fancy baskets. Neatly 
decorate their surface with a little cooked jardiniere; arranged in this 
way they will represent perfect baskets of abundance. Arrange a 
small layer of the preparation for each egg on a silver dish just wide 
enough to hold each one firmly. Place the eggs now on top of each 
layer, pour a gill of Colbert sauce (No. 120) around the dish, but 
none over the eggs. Cover them with a piece of well-buttered paper, 
then place in the oven — rather moderate — for two minutes. Take 
from out the oven and immediately send to the table. 



85 



8o. Eggs a la Geo. O. Jones. 

Take six shelled hard boiled eggs, cut away at the pointed end of 
each tgg a piece half an inch thick, and at the other end a quarter of 
an inch thick. Remove the yolks with a small vegetable scoop, or 
with a pointed knife, mash the yolks in a bowl very fine, and lay them 
aside for further action. 

Place in a sautoire half an ounce of good butter, add one sound 
shelled finely chopped shallot, place the pan on the corner of the 
range, and let simmer, but do not let get brown, add then a table- 
spoonful of Bechamel sauce (No. io8), a teaspoonful of freshly 
chopped up parsley, a tablespoonful of finely grated horse-radish. 
Now add also the yolks, season with a tablespoonful of salt and half a 



86 



saltspoonful of Cayenne pepper; mix all well together with a wooden 
spoon, and then with it stuff the six eggs, so as to give them the exact 
shape of small barrels. 

Lightly butter a tin pan, carefully lay the eggs in it, the stuffed 
part uppermost, sprinkle a little grated Parmesan cheese right in the 
centre of the stuffed part of the eggs. Cover them with a piece of 
buttered paper, place them in a moderate oven for twelve minutes. 
Carefully remove them from the oven, take off the paper. Have a 
hot dish with six fried bread crotitons, half an inch high by one and a 
half inches in diameter, gently place an egg on each cro^iton; pour a 
gill of hot demi-glace (No. 103) around the dish (none over the eggs) 
and immediately serve. 



87 



8i. Eggs a la A. F. Bowers, 
Peel a quarter of a pound of fine, fresh, sound mushrooms, wash 
them thoroughly, seeing that no sand remains on; lay six of the larg- 
est aside (with their stem cut away) for further action. Place in a 
sautoire one ounce of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour; place this 
pan on the corner of a hot range, and let gently cook for eight min- 
utes, slightly stirring once in a while. Add now the mushrooms, 
season with a tablespoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper, 
also half a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, squeezing in the juice of a 
quarter of a sound lemon; mix all well together, then add a gill of 
milk, and let cook for five minutes, lightly stirring meanwhile. Strain 
through a fine sieve into a bowl, and keep it in a warm place until fur- 
ther action. 



88 



Have six shelled hard boiled eggs, and with the point of a keen 
knife make eight triangular incisions right in the centre of each egg 
down to the yolk, then with hands gently pull them apart. Remove 
the yolks, and mash them very fine, then well mix the latter with the 
preparation, and then with it stuff the eggs, giving them a dome shape. 
Lightly butter a silver dish, place a thin layer of the preparation over 
it. Firmly lay the six large mushrooms upside down over the layer, 
place half a teaspoonful of the force in the centre of each mushroom, 
then gently lay the eggs perpendicular over each mushroom. Slice a 
small truffle into six thin slices, place one on top of each egg, sprinkle 
a little clarified butter over all, cover them with buttered paper, then 
place in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. Remove and serve with 
a gill of hot demi-glace (No. 103), in a bowl separate.

97 



88. Eggs a la W. W. Ladd, Jr. 

Provide four fine, sound, white Kalamazoo celery. Cut away all 
the green leaves, and neatly trim it; thoroughly wash twice in cold 
water, so that no sand will adhere to the celery; cut the three celery, 
three inches long from the root part, crosswise. Place three pieces in 
a saucepan with one quart of white broth (No. loi). Season with 
half a tablespoonful of salt, four whole peppers, two cloves, and a 
sprig of thyme. Cover the pan, and let boil on the range for thirty 
minutes. Chop up very fine the balance of the celery, then place it 
in a small saucepan with one ounce of butter, let simmer for five min- 
utes, add two tablespoonfuls of well sifted flour; stir well together, 
and cook for five minutes longer; gradually add now a cup of either

saltspoonful of Cayenne pepper, and cook for twenty minutes longer. 
Remove it from the range, press it through a sieve into a bowl. Well 

98 



butter a silver dish a foot and a quarter in length by three-quarters 
in width. Slide a tube into a pastry bag, pour the celery puree 
into it, and carefully press it down two inches from the centre of 
the dish, commencing at the side of the dish, coming down two 
inches and a half to the right, continuing going all around giving 
an oval shape; make another oval border over the other. Crack six 
fresh eggs in the centre inside the border, then place the dish in the 
hot oven for five minutes. Take up the celery from the pan, place on 
a dish, then split each one in two from the cut part down to the root 
only. Remove the eggs from the oven; open each celery triangular 
shape, place it jointly around the border so as to make it represent a 
star. Strain the broth in which the celery was cooked into a hot bowl, 
add to it a teaspoonful of freshly chopped parsley, mix a little, and 
then pour about a gill of it around the celery, but not over the eggs, 
and serve very hot.

more. Arrange six fried bread croutons on a hot dish. Poach six 
very fresh eggs as for No. i, and place one egg on each crouton, 
then with a larding needle take up one mushroom from the pan, and 
lay it on the top of the egg right in the centre, then take up a piece of 
pepper, lay it on the right of the mushroom, lengthwise, and then take 
up a piece of tongue, and place it on the left of the mushrooms, and 
continue the same with the rest of the eggs. Pour the remaining 
sauce around the dish, but not over the eggs, and immediately send 
to the table. 



90. Eggs a la Lloyd Aspinwall. 

Take out from a can six large cepes, lay them on a dish, and with 
a tube two inches in diameter, cut them perfectly round; place them 
in a sautoire on the range, with a tablespoonful of clarified butter and 
a finely chopped sound shallot; let cook for three minutes on a brisk 
fire, tossing well once in a while. Season with a tablespoonful of salt, 
a teaspoonful of pepper, adding the third of a clove of garlic finely 
chopped up; toss all well for one minute longer, and then lay the pan 
on the corner of the range. Have a deep silver dish lightly buttered; 
take up the six cepes from the pan, arrange them nicely around the 
dish, place the dish at the oven door to keep warm. 



I02 



Chop up very fine the remaining trimming of the cepes, place them 
in the same pan in which the cepes were cooked, add half a teaspoon- 
ful of freshly chopped parsley, squeeze in the juice of half a medium 
sized sound lemon, and a gill of Espagnole sauce (No. 105), and let 
the whole boil for one minute; pour the sauce all around the cepes, 
but not over them. Crack a fresh egg over each cepe, being careful 
not to break the yolk, sprinkle a little salt over each egg, place them 
in the hot oven for two minutes; remove them from out the oven, and

91. Omelet Crime de Vanille a la R. A. C. Smith. 

Pour into a saucepan on the hot range two gills of fresh milk, add 
to it four ounces of powdered sugar, and also one vanilla bean, let 
come to a boil, take the pan from off the range, and let cool off. Re- 
move the vanilla bean, dry it with a napkin, place it in a glass bottle 
with powdered sugar, cork it tightly, and use whenever necessary, as 
it will keep for any length of time. Add to the milk three heaped 
tablespoonfuls of rice flour — which can be had at Park & Til ford's — 
and with a wire whip thoroughly beat together, place the pan on the 
hot range, and continually stir until it boils, then place the pan on the 
corner of the range, and let cook slowly for twelve minutes; strain it 



104 



through a very fine hair sieve into a bowl, add to it a teaspoonful of 
fresh butter, mix it thoroughly, and then leave it in a warm place for 
further action. 

Make an omelet exactly as for No. 46^ and just before folding 
the sides up place half of the preparation right in the centre, fold up, 
and gently turn it on a hot silver dish; place the rest of the prepara- 
tion in a pastry bag, in which you previously slide down a small 
tube at the bottom, press down, make a small rose at each end of 
the omelet, dredge a little powdered sugar over the omelet, gently 
glaze it with a red iron, decorate the sides with any kind of dry cakes 
at hand, cut in triangular shape, and send to the table. 



105

saucepan on the hot range, with one wineglassful of white wine (but 
not Rhine wine); let reduce to three quarters — which will take about 
six minutes. Place a clean napkin over a bowl; pour the whole over 
the napkin; fold it up at both ends, then sharply twist the ends in 
different directions, until the juice is all squeezed into the bowl. 
Have a preparation the same as in No. 91, and use the above in- 
stead of the vanilla, proceeding with the rest exactly in the same way. 



107 



95- Omelet a la M. Ballon. 
Grind two heaped tablespoonfuls of fresh roasted coffee (Java and 
Mocha by preference). Pour in a saucepan on the hot range one and 
a half cups of fresh milk, adding four and a half ounces of powdered 
sugar, and as soon as the milk boils, immediately add the- coffee, 
thoroughly mixing with a spoon meanwhile; tightly cover the pan and 
place it on the corner of the range to infuse for three minutes, taking 
special care not to let it boil again. Strain it through a fine napkin 
into another saucepan, and let it cool off; add then three tablespoon- 
fuls of rice flour y thoroughly beat it with a whip, place it on the fire, 
and continually stir until it comes to a boil; then place the pan on 
the corner of the range and let slowly cook for twelve minutes. Make 
an omelet as in No. 46, and just before folding it up, place half of 
the preparation right in the centre, fold up, turn it onto a hot silver dish; 
liberally dredge the omelet with powdered sugar, glaze the surface 
with a red iron. Slide down a small tube into a pastry-bag, 
pour the rest of the preparation in, make a fancy border around the 

omelet, and send it to the table.

96. Eggs-Cocotte. 

Have six small thoroughly cleaned cocotieres ready. Chop up, 
very fine, one medium-sized, sound peeled shallot, and the half of a 
sound peeled onion; place them in a sautoire on the range with a 
tablespoonful of butter, and cook slowly for three minutes, taking care 
not to let get brown. Chop up, very fine, twenty-four canned mush- 
rooms, add them to the rest with one tablespoonful of freshly chopped 
parsley, and a teaspoonful of chopped chervil (if at hand); season 
with a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, mix all well 
together with the spatula for a second, then add a gill of Espagnole 
sauce (No. 105), and let all cook slowly for five minutes. 

Pour a tablespoonful of the sauce into each cocotiere, then break 
a fresh ^gg into each cocotiere, pour a teaspoonful of the sauce over 
each ^gg, well spread. Place the cocotieres on a tin dish, and bake 
in a very hot oven for two minutes. Remove from out the oven, lay 
them on a dish with a folded napkin and send to the table. 

109 



97- Omelet a la Mrs. W. L. Brown. 

Place in a pan two ounces of chocolate, with just enough milk to 
dissolve it on the hot range; add a cup and a half of fresh milk; con- 
tinually stir until it comes to a boil. Dilute two tablespoonfuls of 
rice flour into two tablespoonfuls of milk, and add it to the chocolate, 
stirring briskly meanwhile; place the pan on the corner of the range, 
and let gently simmer for fifteen minutes, but do not allow it to boil. 

Have an omelet made as in No. 46, and, before folding, place 
half of the preparation right in the centre, fold up, turn it over a hot 
silver dish. Place the balance of the preparation into a pastry-bag, 



no 



with a small tube previously slided down; and by pressing the 
•preparation, make a nice rosette at each end of the omelet. Dec- 
orate the dish all around with six lady-fingers, cut in triangular 
shaped pieces ; carefully press a little of the contents of the bag on 
each piece of lady-fingers, so as to have them represent pretty, small 
roses. Liberally dredge them with powdered sugar, then glaze the 
omelet with a red iron, and then send to the table. 

N. B. — All these sweet omelets should always be promptly made 
for the time of serving, otherwise it would be sufficient cause to fail 
to have them to perfection. 



98. EggS'Cocotte a la Wm, Bracken. 

Prepare and proceed exactly the same as No. 96, only substituting 
one gill of hot Allemande sauce (No. iii) for the gill of Espagnole 
sauce (No. 105), and serve the same. 



112 



99- Fried Eggs for 'Garnishing. 

Pour half a gill of sweet oil into the frying-pan; when the oil is 
hot break in one Q%g, carefully closing up the white part with a skim- 
mer, so as to have it firm, and in a single form. Only one at the 
time should be cooked, and two minutes will be sufficient. 



"3 



loo. Egg Stuffed a la Higgi?is, 

Prepare in a sautoire one ounce of good butter, two tablespoonfuls 
of grated Parmesan cheese, and a tablespoonful of grated Swiss 
cheese, place the sautoire on the corner of the range, slowly stir with 
the spatula until dissolved and well mixed. Cut one ounce of smok- 
ed beef tongue into very thin julienne shaped pieces, one good sized 
sound truffle, and four mushrooms cut the same way. Add now half 
a wine glass of white wine (but not sweet) to the cheese, mix the wine 
and cheese well together, then add the tongue, truffle, and mushrooms. 

Cut six hard shelled boiled eggs in halves lengthwise, remove the 
yolks without breaking the whites; mash the yolks and place in the 
pan with the rest of the preparation, mix the whole well together for 
three minutes while cooking. 



114 



Stuff the twelve half whites with the preparation — up to the level; 
then close them, so as to represent six original eggs. Have a silver 
dish, lightly buttered, ready, then arrange the balance of the stuffing 
right in the centre of the dish, giving a pyramid shape; place the 
eggs at the base of the pyramid upright, so they will lightly lean 
against it. 

Cover the whole with a gill of very thick tomato sauce highly sea- 
soned, sprinkle a very little grated Parmesan cheese over all, then 
place in the oven for fifteen minutes. Remove from the oven and 
serve very hot.

APPENDIX. 



loi. Bouillon Blanc — white broth. 

Place in a large stock-urn on a moderate fire a good heavy knuckle of a fine 
white veal with all the debris, or scraps of meat, including bones, remaining in 
the kitchen (but not of game); cover fully with cold water, adding a handful of 
salt; and as it comes to a boil, be very careful to skim all the scum off — no 
particle of scum should be left on — and then put in two large, sound, well- 
scraped carrots (whole), one whole, cleaned, sound turnip, one whole, peeled, 
large, sound onion, one well-cleaned parsley root, three thoroughly washed leeks, 
and a few leaves of cleaned celery. Boil very slowly for six hours on the corner 
of the range; keenly skim the grease off ; then strain well through a wet cloth 
into a china bowl or a stone jar, and put it away in a cool place for general use. 



1 02. Croiltons for Soups, 



Cut some dice-shaped pieces of bread, and fry them in a pan with clarified 
butter; when a rich golden color, drain, and add to the soup when needed. 

103. Sauce Demi'Glace, or Madeira. 

Add one small glassful of mushroom liquor to one pint of good Espagnole 
sauce (No. 105); also a small glassful of Madeira wine, a bouquet (No. 106), 
and a scant teaspoonful of pepper. Remove the fat carefully and cook for thirty 
minutes, leaving the sauce in a rather liquid state; then strain and use when 
needed. This takes the place of all Madeira sauces. 

117 



104. Batter for Fritters, 

Mix a quarter of a pound of sifted flour in a small basin, with half a pint of 
lukewarm water, to which three-quarters of an ounce of fresh butter has been 
added. Place in a saucepan, which should be tilted on the range so that when 
the water boils the butter can be skimmed off the top. Add, if necessary, a 
little more water to make a soft paste, beating well with a spatula, to keep it 
free from lumps, and of a proper consistence; it must be gray and compact- 
looking. Add just a little warm water to render the paste soft and diluted, al- 
though sufficiently thick to cover the objects for which it is intended; that 
means, it must drop easily from the spoon. Add to this half a pinch of salt and 
two egg-whites; beat well together for one minute, and use at once. 

105. Sauce Espagnole — -for one gall on » 

Mix one pint of raw, strong mirepoix (No. 107) with two ounces of good 
fat (chicken's fat is preferable). Mix with the compound four ounces of flour, 
and moisten with one gallon of white broth (No. loi). Stir well, and then add, 
if handy, some baked veal and ham bones. Boil for three hours, and then re- 
move the fat very carefully; rub the sauce through a very fine sieve, and keep 
it for many purposes in cooking. 

106. A Bouquet — how to prepare. 

Take four branches of well-washed parsley-stalks — if the branches be small, 
take six — one branch of soup-celery, well washed; one blade of bay-leaf, one 
sprig of thyme, and two cloves, placed in the centre of the parsley, so as to prevent 
cloves, thyme, and bay-leaf from dropping out of the bouquet while cooking; 
fold it well, and tightly tie with a string, and use when required in various ways. 

118 



107. Mirepoix, 

Stew in a saucepan two ounces of fat, two carrots, one onion, one sprig of 
thyme, one bay-leaf, six whole peppers, three cloves, and, if handy, a ham 
bone cut into pieces. Add two sprigs of celery and half a bunch of parsley 
roots; cook for fifteen minutes, and use when directed in other recipes. Scraps 
of baked veal may also be added, if at hand. 

1 08 . Bdchamel Sauce. 

Place in a saucepan two ounces of butter, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
and stir constantly for five minutes. Moisten with a pint and a half of boiling 
milk, being careful to pour it in gradually; then beat it well with a whisk. Add 
half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, a pinch of salt, a bouquet (No. 106), twelve 
whole peppers, and a little mushroom liquor, if at hand. Cook well for fifteen 
minutes, and when done rub through a fine sieve. 

1 09 . White-Roux, 

Put in a saucepan two ounces of butter, and place it on the corner of the 
hot range, add to it two tablespoonfuls of flour; keep stirring constantly for seven 
minutes. Then let it cool, and when cold, use in various sauces as directed. 

1 10. Sauce Pirigueux. 

Chop up very fine two fine truffles; place them in a sautoire with a glassful 
of Madeira wine. Reduce on the hot stove for five minutes. Add half a pint of 
Espagnole sauce (No. 105). Just allow to come to a boil, and serve very hot. 

119 



III. 



Sauce Allemande. 



Melt two ounces of butter' in a saucepan on a slow fire, with three table- 
spoonfuls of flour to thicken. Stir well, not letting it brown; then moisten 
with one pint of white broth (No. loi), beating constantly, and cook for ten 
minutes. Dilute three egg-yolks separately in a bowl, pour the sauce over 
the eggs, a very little at a time; strain through a Chinese strainer, and finish 
with half an ounce of good butter and the juice of half a lemon, taking care 
that it does not boil a second time. 

112. Garnishing h la Chipolata~f or one gallon. 

Fry a quarter of a pound of salt pork, cut dice-shaped, for two minutes in 
a saucepan; then add half a pint of carrots cut tubular-shaped, half a pint of 
onions browned and glazed in the oven (No. 113), one pint of blanched and 
peeled chestnuts, half a pint of mushrooms, and six small sausages cut in 
pieces. Add two quarts of Espagnole sauce (No. 105), half a pint of tomato 
sauce (No. 109), a tablespoonful of salt, and a large teaspoonful of pepper. 
Cook for thirty minutes, and use when needed. 

113. Glazed Onions for Garnishing. 

Select one quart of small onions; peel the sides only, and pare the roots 
neatly, being careful not to cut them. Place them in a sautoire with half an 
ounce of clarified butter, and sprinkle them with half a pinch of powdered 
sugar. Glaze them in a slow oven for fifteen minutes; place them in a stone 
jar, and use for garnishing when required. 



114. Eggs a la Rtgence. 

Shred an ounce and a half of salt pork into fine pieces (ham will answer 
the same purpose), also one onion cut into small squares, and six medium-sized 
mushrooms, all of equal size; moisten with a spoonful of good gravy, and 
cook for five minutes. 

115. Sauce Veloufi, 

Melt one ounce of good butter in a saucepan, adding two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, and stir well, not letting it get brown. Moisten with a pint and a half 
of good veal and chicken stock, the stronger the better. Throw in a garnished 
bouquet (No. 106), half a cupful of mushroom liquor, if at hand, six whole pep- 
pers, half a pinch of salt, and a very little nutmeg. Boil for twenty minutes, 
stirring continuously with a wooden spatula; then remove to the side of the 
fire, skim thoroughly and let it continue simmering slowly for one hour. 
Then rub through a fine sieve. This sauce will make the foundation for 
any kind of good white stock. 

116. Lobster Butter. 

Extract the coral from one cooked lobster (the eggs may be used instead); 
pound it in a mortar to a paste, mixing it with one ounce of good butter and a 
teaspoonful of mustard. Rub through a fine sieve, and keep in a cool place. 
The butter can abo be used for coloring purposes. 

117. Pur6e of Chestnuts. 

Boil one pound of chestnuts for ten minutes ; peel and skin them immediate- 
ly, put them in a saucepan with one quart of white broth (No. loi), a tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and two teaspoonfuls of pepper and a quarter of a pound of butter. 
Let all boil well for thirty minutes; rub through a sieve, and use when needed. 

121 



II 8. Sauce a la Poulette. 

Put one pint of hot Allemande sauce (No. iii) into a saucepan, with one 
ounce of fresh butter; adding the juice of half a medium-sized lemon, and a 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Heat well on the hot stove until thoroughly 
melted and mixed, but do not let it boil. Keep the sauce warm, and serve for 
all sauce poulettes. 

119. Cream Sauce. 

Take half a pint of bechamel sauce (No. loS); add half an ounce of butter, 
and beat them together carefully, adding half a cupful of sweet crearn. Then 
serve. 

120. Sauce Colbert. 

Put in a saucepan half a pint of very thick Madeira sauce (No. 103); add 
to it very gradually one ounce of good, fresh butter, also two tablespoonfuls 
of meat-glaze (No. 121). Mix well together without boiling; then squeeze in 
the juice of half a sound lemon, and add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley 
when serving. 

121. Meat Glaze. — Glace de Viande. 

As this meat glaze, when properly made, will keep in perfect condition for 
any length of time, I would advise that half a pint be made at a time, in the 
following manner: Place in a large saucepan ten quarts of white broth (No. 
loi), or nine quarts of consomm6, and reduce it on a moderate fire for fully 
four hours, at which time it should be reduced to half a pint. Transfer it in a 
stone jar or bowl; put a cover on, and keep in a cool place for general use.

BOOKS BY A. FILIPPINI 



"ONE HUNDRED RECIPES FOR COOK- 
ING AND SERVING FISH." This little book

five years' experience with the celebrated house of Delmonico's. It 
includes recipes for preparing, cooking, and serving Salmon, Trout, 
Halibut, Soles, Skates, Shad, Mackerel, Eels, Bluefish, Sheepshead, 
Bass, Cod, Codfish-tongues, Smelts, Lobsters, Crabs, Oysters, Clams,

turned cloth, with an appropriate design in colors, with gold title. 
The price is fifty cents. 



**ONE HUNDRED WAYS OF COOKING 
EGGS." Mr. Filippini is probably the only one who 

can cook eggs in a hundred different ways, and this book will be 
worth ten times its price to any purchaser. Unlike most of his guild, 
who jealously guard every secret of their craft, Mr. Filippini has at 
last been persuaded to admit the world into the inner sanctuary of 
his art, to describe to a hand's turn, and without reserve, exactly 
how those marvelous triumphs of his art have been achieved. Uni- 
form in every respect with ** One Hundred Recipes for Fish."

This work is endorsed by the Delmonicos. Mr. Filippini's experience in Cul- 
inary Art is probably greater than any living man's. The results of a lifetime 
of careful study are here embodied. 

It is infinitely greater than a mere cook-book, for while it gives many more 
recipes than any other work of the kind ever published, at the same time it con- 
tains invaluable advice as to how to buy what is best and most economical, and 
how to dress a table and serve meals. In large families the price of the work 
can be saved daily by following Mr. Filippini's suggestions. One of the excep- 
tional features of this book is the fact that it is adapted to the humblest as well 
as to the grandest style of living. No matter where placed, it will pay for 
itself many times over.

I. How to Serve Oysters for Private Families, 

Oysters should be kept in a very cold place before they are opened, 
and well washed before using, otherwise their appearance will be de- 
stroyed. They should, according to the French custom, be opened 
on the deep shell, so as to better preserve the liquor, then laid on 
finely chopped ice for a short time — too long destroys their flavor. 
While they should be kept as cold as possible, they should never be 
allowed to freeze, therefore they must only be opened shortly before 
they are needed ; for once frozen, they quickly turn sour. The proper 
way to open them is to place the deep shell in the palm of the left 
hand, and break them on one side. The Boston stabbing knife is pref- 
erable for this, but if there be none handy use a small block that the 
oyster can fit into, and stab it on the edge ; or even a chopping-block 
and chopping-knife may be employed in case of necessity. Serve six 
oysters for each person, nicely arranged on oyster-plates with quar- 
ters of lemon. 



2. Oysters a I Alexandre Dumas, 

Place in a sauce-bowl a heaped teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters 
of a teaspoonful of very finely crushed white pepper^ one medium- 
sized fine, sound, well-peeled, and very finely chopped shallot, one 
heaped teaspoonful of very finely chopped chives, and half a 
teaspoonful of parsley, also very finely chopped up. Mix lightly to- 
gether, then pour in a light teaspoonful of olive oil, six drops of Ta- 
basco sauce, one saltspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and lastly one 
light gill, or five and a half tablespoonfuls, of good vinegar. Mix it 
thoroughly with a spoon ; send to the table, and with a teaspoon pour 
a little of the sauce over each oyster just before eating them. 



lO 



3- How to serve Clams, 

Clams should be served on deep plates, covered previously with 
finely chopped ice. To have them sweet and fresh, they should be 
kept as cold as possible. Serve six on each plate with quarters of 
lemon. 



4- To prepare Breaded Fish, 

1. After the fish is pared, cleaned and dried, dip it first in milk, 
then in flour, and fry in very hot fat. 

2. Take very clean fish, dip it in beaten ^gg, then in freshly grated 
bread-crumbs, and fry i'n very hot fat. 

3. For certain fish, like whitebait, immerse them in milk, then in 
flour mixed with pulverized crackers, shake well in a colander, and 
throw into very hot fat. Oysters are breaded the same way, but 
should be flattened before frying. 

4. For croustades of rice or potatoes, dip in beaten tgg and roll 
in fresh bread-crumbs ; repeat three times before frying. 



5- Salmon en Papillate s. 

Procure two pounds of very fresh salmon and cut it into six even 
slices. Season these with a good pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. 
Roll them well. Cut out six heart-shaped pieces of paper, oil them 
nicely, and have twelve thin slices of cooked ham, then proceed to 
prepare them exactly as for mackerel en papillote (No. 31). 



13 



6. SalmoUy oyster sauce. 

Place two pounds of very fresh salmon in a fish-kettle, completely 
cover with cold water, season with a handful of salt, add one medium- 
sized, sliced onion, half a wine-glassful of white vinegar, eight whole 
peppers, two cloves, and two parsley-roots. Range the kettle on a 
brisk fire. Five minutes after coming to a boil the salmon will be 
sufficiently cooked. Remove from the kettle, drain it welt; dress on 
a hot dish with a folded napkin, nicely decorate with parsley-greens 
all around the salmon, and serve with a pint of hot oyster sauce (No. 
loi) separately. 

The necessary time to cook the above to perfection, from begin- 
ning to end, will be thirty-five minutes. 



14 



7. Salmon Colbert. 

Proceed as for No. 6, and serve with three-quarters of a pint of 
Colbert sauce (No. 102), also four plain boiled potatoes served separ- 
ately, and cut in quarters. 



15 



8. Salmon h la Gdnoise. 

To be prepared the same as (No. 7), garnishing with four clusters 
of mushrooms — four mushrooms on each cluster — and six cooked 
crawfish instead of the boiled potatoes. Serve with half a pint of 
Genoise sauce (No. 164) separate. 



16 



9- Salmon, rolled a llrlandaise. 

Bone three pounds of salmon. Parboil it. Besprinkle the sides 
and insides with a pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and the same 
of nutm^ ; also twelve chopped oysters, one tablespoonful of par- 
sley, and half a cupful of bread-crumbs. Roll it together, then put it 
in a deep pan with one ounce of butter. Bake in a hot oven for 
twenty-five minutes and serve on a dish, pouring its own gravy over. 



17 



lo. Broiled Salmon-tail. 

Take three pounds of the tail part of a salmon. Steep it for five 
or six hours in a marinade composed of three tablespoonfuls of olive 
oil in a dish with a quarter of a bunch of parsley-roots, two bay-leaves, 
and a sprig of thyme. Take out the salmon and broil for ten minutes 
on one side and five minutes on the other (skin side). Dress on a 
hot dish, and serve with two ounces of melted butter, flavored with a 
light teaspoonful of finely chopped chervil, half a teaspoonful of chives, 
and the juice of half a medium-sized, sound lemon. 



i8 



II. Boiled Halibut, 

Put a piece of halibut weighing two pounds in a saucepan, and 
cover it with fresh water; add one sliced onion, half a sliced carrot, 
and a bouquet (No. io6). Season with a handful of salt and two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Put on the lid and let cook gently, but no 
more than five minutes,.after boiling-point; then lift up the fish alone, 
drain well; dress it on a hot dish, and serve with any desired sauce. 



19 



12. Halibut Steaks, maitre d' hotel. 

Wipe well a two-pound piece of fresh halibut, lay it on a dish, and 
season it with a pinch of salt, a pinch of pepper, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of sweet oil. Roll it well and lay it on a c^)uble broiler; then 
place it on a brisk fire, and broil for eight minutes on each side. 
Dress the fish on a hot dish, pour a gill of tnaitre d'hotel sauce (No. 
107) over, decorate with parsley-greens, and serve. 



20 



13. Trout, Shrimp Sauce. 

Clean, wash and dry six fine trout, weighing about a quarter of a 
pound each. Place them on a grate in the fish-kettle, with a pinch of 
salt, adding one sliced carrot, one sprig of thyme, and two bay-leaves. 
Moisten with half a glassful of white wine and half a pint of water. 
Put it on the stove, and let it simmer gently for five minutes after 
boiling-point; then drain and serve on a dish garnished with parsley. 
Send it to the table with half a pint of shrimp sauce (No. 108) in a 
separate bowl, also four plain, boiled potatoes, cut in quarters, a I'An- 
glaise (No. 109). Keep the fish-stock for further use. 



14- Trout a la Cambaceres. 

Cook six trout as for (No. 13); when cooked, then place on a hot 
dish. Put in a saucepan two minced truffles, six mushrooms, also 
minced, and half a pint of Espagnole sauce (No. no), also twelve olives 
and three tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce. Let cook for ten minutes, 
then skim off the fat very carefully, and pour the sauce over the trout 
before serving. 



22 



15. Trout a la Chambord. 

Clean, wash, and dry three fine trout of half a pound each. 
Stuff them with fish forcemeat (No. iii), and place them in a deep 
baking-dish, buttering it well with about half an ounce of butter. Add 
half a glassful of white wine, a bouquet (No. 106), half a pinch of 
salt, and half a pinch of pepper. Cook for fifteen minutes in the oven, 
being very careful to baste it frequently. Take the juice from under 
the fish, and put it in a saucepan with half a pint of good Espagnole 
sauce (No. no). Reduce and skim off the fat. Add one truffle and 
four mushrooms, all well-sliced, also twelve blanched oysters. Dress 
the trout on a hot dish, pour the sauce over, and decorate the fish 
with six fish quenelles (No. in). 



23 



1 6. Broiled Trout, maitre d'hdtel. 

Procure six fine trout, of a quarter of a pound each; clean and 
wash well, drain them in a napkin, and make three incisions on each 
side. Place them on a dish with one teaspoonful of oil, a pinch of 
salt, and half a pinch of pepper; roll gently and put them on the 
broiler. Cook for four minutes on each side, then lay them on a dish, 
pour a gill of maitre d'hotel sauce (No. 112) over, and serve with six 
slices of lemon, or with any other sauce desired. 



24 



ly. Trouty with fine Herbs, 

Clean, wash, and dry six fine trout of a quarter of a pound each. 
Put them on a buttered dish, adding half a glassful of white wine and

parsley-stalks — if the branches be small, take six— one branch of soup-celery, well 
washed; one blade of bay-leaf, one sprig of thyme, and two cloves, placed in the 
centre of the parsley, so as to prevent cloves, thyme, and bay-leaf from dropping out 
of the bouquet while cooking; fold it well, and tightly tie with a string, and use when 
required in various recipes. 

107. Butter, maitre d'hotel.— Put one ounce of good butter in a bowl with a

yolks. Season with half a pinch each of salt and pepper and the third of a pinch of 
nutmeg; mix well, and then divide into twelve parts, shaping each one like a cork,

fifteen minutes. Cool, and use when needed for various methods of cooking fish. 

119. Sauce Veloute. — Melt one ounce of good butter in a saucepan, adding two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir well, not letting it get brown. Moisten with a pint

nished bouquet (No. io6), half a cupful of mushroom liquor, if at hand, six whole pep- 
pers, half a pinch of salt, and a very little nutmeg. Boil for twenty minutes, stirring 

ii6 



continuously with a wooden spatula ; then remove to the side of the fire, skim thor- 
oughly, and let it continue simmering slowly for one hour. Then rub through a fine 
sieve. This sauce will make the foundation for any kind of good white stock.

the same of tarragon, very little chives, the same of chervil, and one small, peeled 
shallot. Add half a teaspoonful of anchovy essence, one ounce of good butter, and 
half a drop of spinach-green. Rub through a fine sieve, and keep it in a cool place 
for general use. 

117 



124, Lobster Forcemeat. — Fry an onion, chopped very fine, in one ounce of 
good butter until it is of a golden brown color, adding one tablespoonful of flour to 
make a roux (No. 117). Moisten with half a pint of white stock (No. 131), stirring

put it in a bowl with three tablespoonfuls of veloute sauce (No. 119). 

126, White Broth,— Place in a large stock -urn on a moderate fire a good heavy 
knuckle of a fine white veal with all the debris, or scraps of meat, including bones, 
remaining in the kitchen (but not of game); cover fully with cold water, adding a 
handful of salt; and as it comes to a boil, be very careful to skim all the scum off— no 
particle of scum should be left on — and then put in two large, sound, well-scraped 
carrots (whole), one whole, cleaned, sound turnip, one whole, peeled, large, sound 
onion, one well-cleaned parsley root, three thoroughly washed leeks, and a lew leaves 
of cleaned celery. Boil very slowly for six hours on the corner of the range; keenly

liquor to one pint of good Espagnole sajiice (No. no); also a small glassful of Madeira 
wine, a bouquet (No. io6), and a scant teaspoonful of pepper. Remove the fat care-

130. Sauce HoUandaise.— Place one sound, sliced onion, six whole peppers 
and a bay-leaf in a saucepan with two ounces of good butter on the hot stove; stir

careful to remove any accumulated fat. Add half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg 
and half a tablespoonful of salt, and cook for twenty-five minutes. Beat the yolks of 
three eggs separately with the juice of half a medium-sized sound lemon. Pour them

shallots; place them in a small saucepan on the hot range, with two tablespoon fuls 
of either tarragon or chervil vinegar, and five whole crushed peppers. Reduce until 
nearly dry, then put away to cool. Mingle with it six fresh raw egg-yolks, sharply 
stirring meanwhile, then gradually add one and a half ounce of good fresh butter, 
seasoning with half a tablespoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg, and 
twelve finely chopped sound tarragon leaves. Have a much wider pan on the fire 
with boiling water, place the small one containing the ingredients into the other, and 
see that the boiling water reaches up to half its height; thoroughly heat up, beating 

120 



briskly with the whisk; when the sauce is firm add one teaspoonful of melted meat- 
glaze (No. 103), beat lightly for two seconds longer, then strain through an ordinary,

turned cloth, with an appropriate design in colors, with gold title. 
The price is fifty cents. 



**ONE HUNDRED WAYS OF COOKING 
EGGS/' Mr. Filippini is probably the only one who 

can cook eggs in a hundred different ways, and this book will be 
worth ten times its price to any purchaser. Unlike most of his guild, 
who jealously guard every secret of their craft, Mr, Filippini has at 
last been persuaded to admit the world into the inner sanctuary of 
his art, to describe to a hand's turn, and without reserve, exactly 
how those marvelous triumphs of his art have been achieved. Uni- 
form in every respect with ** One Hundred Recipes for Fish." 
Fifty cents.

This work is endorsed by the Delmonicos. Mr. Filippini's experience in Cul- 
inary Art is probably greater than any living man's. The results of a lifetime 
of careful study are here embodied. 

It is infinitely greater than a mere cook-book, for while it gives many more 
recipes than any other work of the kind ever published, at the same time it con- 
tains invaluable advice as to how to buy what is best and most economical, and 
how to dress a table and serve meals. In large families the price of the work 
can be saved daily by following Mr. Filippini's suggestions. One of the excep- 
tional features of this book is the fact that it is adapted to the humblest as well 
as to the grandest style of living. No matter where placed, it will pay for 
itself many times over.

I. Feuilletage, or Puff Paste. 

Have ready one pound of flour, one pound of fresh butter, one 
pint of ice-water, and a saltspoonful of salt. If the butter be salted 
instead of fresh, no salt is necessary, but wash the butter well before 
using it. Put the flour on the table, make a hollow space in the cen- 
tre, then put in it one ounce of the butter, adding the pint of ice- 
water and the salt, and mix the whole well together, incorporating it 
gradually. Put it aside in a cool place for five minutes. Have ready 
the remaining fifteen ounces of butter, which must be very firm; 
sprinlde the space of a square foot of the table with a very little flour, 
place the dough on it, then lengthen and widen with a wooden roller 
to the thickness of half an inch, and lay the fifteen ounces of butter 



in one lump in the centre. Fold over the four edges so as to enclose 
it, then flatten again lightly with the roller until it forms a piece two 
inches thick, and then put it away to cool for ten minutes. Roll it 
again lengthwise, fold it in four, and let it rest for another five min- 
utes; then repeat the same twice more, rolling it each time in a con- 
trary direction. After five minutes it will be ready for use. This 
feuilletage, or puff paste, if put away carefully in a cool place, will 
keep for three days, and can be used for the following purposes : vol- 
au-vents of chickens, oysters, clams, shrimps, lobsters, codfish, crabs, 
and crawfish; also for making chicken patties, bouch^es a la reine, all 
kinds of tarts, allumettes, mille-feuilles, chaussons, turnovers, petits 
pates a la religieuse, etc., etc. 

2. Peach Tarts. 

Take half a pound of feuilletage (No. i), roll it out twelve 
inches long by eight wide, then with a paste-cutter cut out six pieces, 



and arrange them neatly on six scalloped tart-molds, each three and 
a half inches wide. Take each separate mold in the hand, and with 
the thumb press the paste gently at the bottom and sides, to so give 
it the perfect shape of the mold, but avoid pressing the paste on the 
edge, so that in baking it will swell and rise beautifully. Divide 
three ounces of apple marmalade into six equal parts, and fill the 
bottom of the tarts with it, then wipe six good-sized, solid, fine peaches, 
peel and cut them into six quartered pieces ; arrange them nicely over 
the marmalade in the tarts, then distribute two ounces of powdered 
sugar evenly over all ; lay them on a baking-sheet, put them in a mod- 
erate oven for twenty minutes, draw them to the door, and sprinkle 
the edges lightly with powdered sugar; then leave them in the closed 
oven for two minutes to allow the sugar to melt thoroughly. Remove 
them from the fire, put to cool for twenty minutes, and then spread 
evenly over the peaches one and a half ounces of apple jelly. Dress 
the tarts on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 



iz 



3- Pineapple Tarts, 

Choose a small, sound pineapple, cut it in two, roll a towel round 
one-half and lay it in the ice-box for further use. Pare and peel 
neatly the other half; then cut it into small and very thin slices; lay 
them in a vessel with two ounces of powdered sugar, mixing lightly 
for one minute. Arrange the slices carefully over the marmalade in 
the six tarts, prepared as for peach tarts (No. 2); then finish, and serve 
exactly the same. 



12 



4- Strawberry Tarts, 

Line six tart-molds as for peach tarts (No. 2), divide into them 
evenly eight ounces of apple marmalade; lay them on a baking- 
sheet, and put them in a moderate oven for twenty minutes; re- 
move them to the door; sprinkling the edges liberally with powdered 
sugar, return them to the oven, and close the door for two minutes, 
so that the sugar melts thoroughly; lift them out, put them to cool 
for twenty minutes, then take out half the marmalade. Pick and wash 
neatly a pint of ripe and sound strawberries; put them in a vessel 
with two ounces of powdered sugar, mix well for one minute, then 
divide them equally into the six tarts; spread over one and a half 
ounces of apple jelly; dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded 
napkin, and serve. 



13 



5- Apple Tarts, 

Take four ounces of pie-paste, and with it line six oval, channeled 
tart-molds, four inches long, three inches wide, and one deep. Have 
three ounces of apple marmalade, and divide it evenly at the bot- 
tom of the molds; then peel, core, and cut four sound, medium- 
sized apples into quarters, and put them in a saucepan, with a pint 
of cold water; place the lid on, and let cook on the hot stove for ten

slightly; and the top with two ounces of cleaned currants. Garnish 
between the apples with four ounces of candied fruits, placing some 
on top. Pears, angelica, and cherries, all sliced, make a pretty effect. 
Return to the oven for five minutes, and serve.

53 



41. Wheat Cakes, 

Put into a vessel four ounces of sifted wheat flour, half an ounce 
of powdered sugar, one drachm of compressed yeast. Break in four 
whole eggs, and mix well with the spatula for three minutes. Add 
half a pint of cold milk, and beat well with the pastry-whip for four

a small griddle, greasing the surface lightly. Drop about two ounces 
of the batter onto the griddle; bake ten seconds; turn it with a cake- 
turner, and bake ten seconds on the other side. See that the cake 
is a light brown color on both sides. Put them on a hot dish, keep- 
ing it warm on a corner of the range, and proceed to make eleven 
more with the remainder of the batter. Serve very hot, with honey 
or maple sugar separately. 



54 



42. Batter for all Kinds of Frying. 

Put half a pound of flour into a basin. Make a hollow in the cen- 
tre, and drop into it one Qg% yolk, half a teaspoonful of sweet oil, a 
tablespoonful of brandy, and a light saltspoonful of salt. Mix all 
the ingredients, except the flour, for three minutes, using the hand. 
Then gradually knead in the flour, meanwhile dropping in, little by- 
little, one gill of cold water. Mix well, moving in the same direction 
for five minutes. Then put it into a vessel, cover with a cloth, and 
set aside to rest for three or four hours. When ready to use, beat 
the whites of three eggs to a froth with a pastry-whip, add it to the 
batter, and mix together thoroughly with the spatula for two minutes. 
It will now be ready for use, but should it not all be required, it will 
keep in a cool place. 



55 



43- French Pancakes. 

Sift half a pound of wheat flour into a bowl. Break in three 
whole eggs. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, and mix well with 
the spatula, adding half a pint of cold milk, pouring it in very 
gradually, and mixing for five minutes. Butter lightly a griddle or 
frying-pan; place it on the stove, and when it is hot, drop onto it 
two and a half ounces of the batter, and bake two minutes; turn 
over, and bake the other side as long. Turn the pancake on a hot 
dessert-dish, and sprinkle over plenty of powdered sugar. Make 
eleven more out of the remaining batter. Serve very hot. 



56 



44' French Pancakes ii la Gelte, 

Make the batter exactly the same as for No. 43. When cooked, 
arrange the pancakes neatly upon a napkin, and spread over each 
one about a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Roll them up nicely, and 
dress on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkling a little powdered sugar over. 
Then, with a red-hot iron, glaze the surface of each cake in three 
different parts; wipe the sides of the dish nicely, and send to the 
table. 

French pancakes with apple, apricot, plum, pineapple, strawberry, 
raspberry, or peach jelly, are to be prepared exactly the same, using 
different jellies. 



57 



45- German Pancakes, 

Prepare a batter as for French pancakes (No. 43); butter an 
iron pan, one foot in diameter, and one and a half inches deep. Place 
this on a hot stove, and pour all the batter into it, letting it cook for 
three minutes. Remove to a brisk oven for seven minutes. Take it 
out, slide the cake carefully on a hot dessert-dish, and send it to the 
table with six pieces of lemoa 



58 



46. German Pancakes with Apples, 

Prepare the batter exactly as for No. 45. Butter the pan as 
for the above. When the batter has been poured in, spread over it 
evenly one pint of preserved apples, cut into small pieces, and finish 
cooking exactly as for the plain pancake (No. 45). When ready, 
slide it carefully on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkle plentifully with pow- 
dered sugar, and send to the table very hot, with six pieces of lemon 
separately. 



59 



47- Batter for Fritters. 

Mix a quarter of a pound of sifted flour in a small basin, with half 
a pint of lukewarm water, to which three-quarters of an ounce of fresh 
butter has been added. Place in a saucepan, which should be tilted 
on the range so that when the water boils the butter can be skimmed 
off the top. Add, if necessary, a little more water to make a soft 
paste, beating well with a spatula, to keep it free from lumps, and of 
a proper consistence; it must be gray and compact-looking. Add 
just a little warm water to render the paste soft and diluted, although 
sufficiently thick to cover the objects for which it is intended; that 
means, it must drop easily from the spoon. Add to this half a pinch 
of salt and two egg-whites; beat well together for one minute, and 
use at once. 



60 



48. Apple Fritters, 

Take three medium-sized, fine, sound apples; peel and core them 
neatly. Cut each into six equal round slices. Place them in a ves- 
sel, pour over a gill of good brandy, add a light saltspoonful of 
ground cinnamon, and let all steep for two hours. Strain them 
through a fine sieve, being careful to keep them whole, and saving 
the liquid for further use. Prepare a fritter batter as for No. 47, 
dip each slice separately into it, and with a spoon, drop them singly 
into very hot but not boiling lard, being careful to remove them with 
a skimmer as soon as they are of a good golden color. Two minutes 
will be sufficient to have them properly done. Then lay them on a 
clean cloth, to dry off the grease. Arrange a folded napkin on a hot 
dessert-dish; arrange the fritters on it, and leave it at the oven door 
for two minutes. Dredge about an ounce of powdered sugar over, 
and serve. 

61 



49- Fritters Soufflis a la Vanille, 

Infuse in a saucepan half of a vanilla-bean in half a pint of boil- 
ing milk, and reduce it to half. Remove the vanilla-bean, and put 
in one ounce of good butter. Let it come to a boil, then add two 
ounces of sifted flour, and with the spatula stir briskly, to form a 
paste so stiff that it will no longer adhere to the saucepan. Remove 
it to another vessel. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, two tgg 
yolks, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Beat the white of one tgg to 
a stiff froth, and mix it in with half a spoonful of whipped cream (No. 
65); this will form a consistent paste. Roll it on a floured board, 
besprinkle lightly with flour, and cut out pieces the size of a walnut. 
With a skimmer drop them into very hot but not boiling fat. Cook 
quickly for three minutes, until they are a fine golden color. Ar- 
range upon a folded napkin, and serve with powdered sugar sifted 
over. 

62 



50. Pound Cake, 

Put in a vessel half a pound of butter, with half a pound of pow- 
dered sugar. Grate in the rind of half a lemon, and with the hand 
knead well for twenty minutes. Break into a plate five whole raw 
eggs; add gradually and carefully, kneading sharply with the hand 
for ten minutes longer. Now add half a pound of well-sifted flour, 
mixing the whole slowly and thoroughly for five minutes more. But- 
ter a two-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with brown paper at the 
bottom and sides. Fill it with the preparation, and put it in a slow 
oven to bake for fully one hour. Remove, and let cool off for about 
two hours. 



63 



5 1 . Wedding Cake, 

Place in a large bowl one pound of powdered sugar and one pound 
of well-washed butter. Grate in the rind of two lemons; and with 
the hand knead well for ten minutes. Break in ten whole eggs, two 
at a time, and knead for ten minutes longer. Mix in a plate a tea- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of ground cloves, two 
of ground allspice, one of mace, and one of grated nutmeg, and add 
these, with half a gill of confectioner's molasses. Mix well for one 
minute with the hand. Add one pound of well-sifted flour, stirring 
for two minutes more. Add two pounds of currants, two pounds of 
Sultana, two pounds of Malaga raisins, one pound of candied citron, 
finely sliced, one gill of Jamaica rum, and one gill of brandy. Mix 
the whole well together for fifteen minutes — using both hands, if nec- 
essary. Butter the interior of a plain, five-quart, round cake-mold. 
Line the bottom and sides with paper, leaving it an inch and a half 
higher than the edge of the mold. Pour in all the preparation, and 

64 



place it in a very slow oven to bake for five hours. When done, lay 
it on a table, to cool off for four hours. Unmold, detach the paper, 
and turn the cake bottom up on a wire pastry-grate. After ten min- 
utes glaze it with one egg-white which has been beaten in a bowl with 
four ounces of extra fine sugar, using the spatula; use a knife to ap- 
ply the glazing. Now lay the cake in a warm place to dry for two 
hours. Then beat up the white of an egg with four ounces of extra 
fine sugar for ten minutes, and glaze the cake as before, evenly all 
around, and lay aside for two hours more. After it is thoroughly 
dried, lay it on a round wooden board, with a fancy paper over, two 
inches wider than the board. Procure a fancy wedding-bell, with a 
miniature bride and groom standing under, lay it in the centre of the 
cake, fastening it on with glace royale (No. loi), pressing it through 
a paper cornet with a fancy tube. Decorate the surface of the cake 
with ornaments made of the glace; also a fancy border around the 
edge and base. Let it dry slightly for two hours, and it is ready 
for use. 

65 



52. sponge Cake, 

Put into a copper basin half a pound of powdered sugar. Break 
in seven whole eggs, and grate in the rind of half a lemon. Beat 
well together with the wire-whip for one minute; then place it on a 
slow fire and heat it slightly, stirring it sharply and continually. 
Take it from the fire, and beat it well until thoroughly cold. Remove 
the whip and with a skimmer mix in carefully and slowly half a 
pound of well-sifted flour; two minutes and a half will be sufficient. 
Butter the interior of a one-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with 
paper, keeping it an inch and a half higher than the mold. Then fill 
it with the preparation, and bake for one hour and fifteen minutes in 
a moderate oven. Let it cool thoroughly for two hours; unmold, 
place it on a pastry wire-grate, and glaze it the same as for vanilla 
eclairs. Decorate artistically with a glace royale (No. loi), arrang- 
ing it in any desired fanciful design. Serve on a dessert-dish, covered 
with a fancy paper. 

66 



53- ^Vci'ffl^^^ -with Sugar. 

Put in a vessel three ounces of powdered sugar, one pound of 
flour, three raw eggs, three ounces of melted butter; mix all well to- 
gether with a spatula for five minutes. Add a pint and a half of 
sweet cream, and mix again well for two minutes. Have your waffle- 
iron hot on both sides, and on a clear fire. Grease with melted but- 
ter, using a feather for the purpose, and drop into each of the holes 
two tablespoonfuls of the paste. Bake two minutes on each side, 
and if they have not a good golden color bake one minute longer on 
each side. Heap them as fast as cooked on a hot dessert-dish. 
When all are done, besprinkle plentifully with powdered sugar, and 
serve very hot.

54- 



Hoiv to Peel and Pound Almonds, 



Put the almonds into boiling water; let them soak three minutes; 
strain, and lay them in cold water to thoroughly cool. Drain well 
again, and peel by pressing each almond between the thumb and fin- 
gers. Then put them into a sieve, and place them at the door of a 
slow oven to dry for ten minutes. Now pound them gently in a mor- 
tar, stirring well to prevent them from getting oily, and taking care 
to pound them very fine for at least ten minutes. Lay them on a 
cold dish, and use when needed. 

55. Bitter Almond Macaroons. 

Take a quarter of a pound of sweet almonds, and two ounces of 
bitter almonds; peel and pound them. Put them into a bowl with 
twelve ounces of powdered sugar and the whites of two eggs. Mix 

68 



thoroughly with a wooden spatula for at least five minutes. Then take 
a pastry -bag, slide down to the bottom of it a tube (which should not 
be larger than a five -cent piece), and pour the preparation into the bag. 
Prepare a pastry baking-pan; lay on it a piece of brown paper the full 
size of the pan (do not put it on the stove at present); then with the 
two hands press the preparation down gently into the papered pan, 
dropping it carefully into bits the size and shape of a silver quarter- 
dollar, trying to have them as near alike as possible, and taking care 
that each is entirely separated from the others. Take a damp towel 
and drop it gently on to the macaroons, so as to shape them perfectly. 
Then place the pan in a slow oven for twenty minutes. Before lifting 
them out, be careful that they are a good golden color. Let them get 
thoroughly cool. To remove the macaroons easily from the paper, 
wet part of a table; lay the paper over this for two minutes, and the 
macaroons will detach very easily. The above quantity will make 
about fifty macaroons. Put aside in a jar those not needed, as they 
will keep perfectly fresh for several days. 

69 



56. Gingerbread a la Francaise, 

Make a hollow space in a pound of flour laid on the table. Peel 
and chop up very fine five ounces of almonds; put them into the hol- 
low with a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, the same quantity of ground 
cloves, four ounces of powdered sugar, and seven ounces of fresh 
honey. Knead the ingredients well for five minutes, then mix in the 
flour, and knead the preparation with the hands in all directions for 
fully thirty minutes without ceasing. Finish by forming it into a ball. 
Lay this on a dish, cover it with a napkin, and place it in a tempera- 
ture of sixty degrees for six hours. Lay the paste on a floured table, 
and roll it out eighteen inches long by twelve wide. Butter well a 
baking-sheet, lay the paste on top, and put it in a very slow oven to 
bake for forty-five minutes. Remove, lay the baking-sheet on the ta- 
ble, cut the cake immediately into small pieces, lozenge shaped, one 
and a half inches long by one inch wide, or any other shape desired; 
let cool off thoroughly for about twenty minutes, then dress on a glass 
bowl, and serve. ^_ 



57« Home-made Cake. 

Put into a bowl half a pound of sugar and half a pound of good 
butter. Mix thoroughly with the hand for fifteen minutes. Break 
four eggs, leaving the whites in a basin, and drop the yolks in with the 
butter and sugar. Mix again. Now beat the whites to a froth and 
add them to the other ingredients. Grate in half a saltspoonful of 
nutmeg; add half a pound of flour; mix well again; stir in two ounces 
of well-cleansed currants, and two ounces of peeled sweet almonds cut 
into small pieces. Mingle all well together with the hand for five 
minutes, and with the other hand drop in one gill of brandy. Have 
a round cake mold holding two quarts; butter it lightly with a hair 
brush, and sprinkle in a little sugar. Drop a third of the preparation 
into the mold; spread over it two ounces of candied orange, shred into 
thin slices; then add half of the remaining preparation; spread on top 
of it two ounces of shred, candied citron, and fill the mold with the 
rest. Lay a piece of brown paper over, and put the mold into a very 

71 



moderate oven for two hours. Let it get a good golden color. Re- 
move, and cool off in the mold, which will take about three hours. 
Remove the cake by turning it bottom up. Arrange a lace paper on a 
dessert-dish. Glaze the cake with a glace a I'eau, dress it on the dish, 
and decorate the top and border tastefully with assorted candied fruits. 

58. Rice Cake. 

Boil two ounces of rice for twenty-five minutes. When well done, 
drain, and add to it a short paste made of half a pound of flour, six 
ounces of butter, two egg-whites, and half a saltspoonful of salt. 
Pound the paste and rice well together in a mortar, and have a baking- 
pan covered with a sheet of buttered paper; lay the paste on top, 
spreading it out about six inches square. Put it in the oven for 
twenty minutes. Remove it, detach it from the paper, lay it on a 
dessert -dish, with a folded napkin, and serve hot. 

Vermicelli cake is prepared the same way, only the vermicelli 
should not cook longer than twelve minutes. 

72 



59« Almond Cake. 

Make a plain paste in a vessel with four ounces of butter, three 
egg yolks, half a pound of well-sifted flour, four ounces of powdered 
sugar, and a quarter of a pound of finely pounded almonds, a salt- 
spoonful of salt, and about six drops of orange-flower water. Mix 
and stir well for five minutes. It will then be of a proper consist- 
encyj spread it round about eight inches in diameter on a buttered 
paper in a pan, and with a light hair brush moisten the surfeice 
slightly with beaten egg. Bake twenty minutes. Remove, detach 
from the paper, set away to cool, and serve. 



73 



6o. Biscuits a la Cuillere^ or Lady-fingers. 

Put four ounces of powdered sugar and the yolks of five eggs into 
a small bowl. Beat thoroughly with a spatula for five minutes. Put 
the whites of the eggs into a copper basin, and with a wire-whip beat 
them to a stiff froth. Add to the sugar and yolks four ounces of 
flour; mix together gently for half a minute, and immediately add the 
whites. Beat gently for one minute more, and the preparation will 
be ready. Take a well-cleaned pastry-bag, slide into it a No. 2 tube, 
and with a wooden spoon or small skimmer pour the preparation into 
the bag. When it is all in, close the upper part of the bag very firmly, 
and lay it aside for one moment. Take two separate sheets of solid, 
brown paper, each measuring seventeen inches long by five inches 
wide; lay them on the table, one beside the other. Take hold of the 
lower part of the bag near the tube with the left hand, and the upper 

74 



part with the right, press with the latter and drop the batter on the 
paper in straight strips four inches long by one inch wide. Make ten 
of equal size on each paper, being careful to leave an empty space of 
three-quarters of an inch between each. Then with a sugar-dredger 
sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar three times, at one minute's 
interval between each sprinkling. When finished, lift up one paper at 
a time, keeping it perfectly straight, and shake off the loose sugar, be- 
ing particular that the biscuits do not detach from the paper. Now 
lay them in a pastry baking-pan, and let rest for two minutes; put 
them into a slow oven, and bake for twenty minutes, until of a light 
golden color. Remove, lift them from the pan, and lay on a table to 
cool off. Have ready a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, then de- 
taching the biscuits gently from the paper with the hands, dress them 
neatly on the dish, and send to the table. 



75 



6i. Meringues. 

Put six tg'g whites into a copper basin, with a light half saltspoon- 
ful of salt, and with a wire-whip begin beating slowly, but gradually 
increase until a stiff froth is obtained. Should it become grainy, beat 
briskly again, adding half an ounce of powdered sugar. (Eight min- 
utes should suffice to a have proper froth. ) Remove the whip. Have 
on a plate one pound of powdered sugar, and with a spatula drop the 
sugar slowly and carefully over the froth, mixing it in meanwhile 
with the spatula. This should take about two minutes. Flavor it 
with any desired flavoring, and it will be ready for use. 



76 



62. Apples Meringuies. 

Have six fine apples cooked as for No. 34; dress them on a des- 
sert-dish, filling the cavities with currant jelly; then decorate all 
round and the tops with meringue, prepared as for No. 61, half the 
quantity being sufficient. Sprinkle them moderately with powdered 
sugar; lay the dish on a baking-pan, and put it in the oven for 
five minutes. When a light brown color, remove, and serve either 
hot or cold. 



77 



6^. Creme Renversee. 
Put in a copper sugar-pan three ounces if granulated sigar with 
half a gill of cold water. Toss the pan briskly to melt the sugar well; 
then place it on the stove, and let it boil slowly until it becomes a 
light brown color. If a moderate fire, it will require four minutes, 
but if a brisk one, only two will suffice; this will now be a caramel. 
Take a pudding-mold holding one quart; line the interior with all the 
caramel, holding the mold in the left hand, and spreading it evenly all 
round. Put the mold in a cool place, and let it become thoroughly 
cold. Have one pint of milk in a bowl; break in four eggs, add a 
quarter of a pound of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of lemon es- 
sence. Beat well for five minutes; strain through a sieve into another 
bowl, and fill the mold with this cream. Place it in a tin pan filled 
with water to half the height of the mold, and place in a very 
moderate oven for forty-five minutes. When of a good golden color 
remove, and cool for at least two hours. Turn it on a dessert-dish, 
and serve with its own juice. 

78 



64. Creme en Mousse au CafL 

Take a pint of whipped cream as for No. 65, add three table- 
spoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 67), and beat well together for 
five minutes. Transfer it to a china bowl, and put it in a cold ice- 
box. When ready to serve, use a spoon to drop the cream care- 
fully upon the centre of a cold, round dessert-dish, keeping it as high 
as possible, shaping it into a pretty, artistic dome. Send immedi- 
ately to the table. 



79 



65. Whiffed Cream a la Vanille. 

Put a pint of sweet cream into a basin. Have a tub or large 
dish-pan containing chopped ice and a little water, and lay the basin 
on top. With a soft wire egg-whip beat the cream slowly at first, and 
increase in swiftness until it is a firm froth. Sweeten with two ounces 
of powdered sugar, and add a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, beating 
constantly. Let it rest, and use when needed. Remove all the super- 
fluous milk which may be found with the cream, before using it. 



80 



66. Charlotte Russe a la Crkme. 

Take six small, round charlotte russe molds two and a half inches 
high, three inches in diameter at the top by two at the bottom. 
When thoroughly cleaned, line them with biscuits k la cuill^re (No. 
60), cut them in two, and should they be higher than the mold, trim 
them off to the edge. Pour the whipped cream (No. 65) into a pastry- 
bag, and fill up the molds. Turn them over onto six dessert-plates, 
spread a little more cream on the top of each, and cover them each 
with one macaroon. Dress the rest of the cream nicely around the 
plates, and serve. 



81 



67. Coffee Essence. 

Take one ounce of good, ground coffee; place it in a small sauce- 
pan with half a pint of cold water, and let boil until reduced to about 
two tablespoonfuls. Then strain through a cloth, pressing it well, and 
let cool thoroughly. Add it to the cream as described in No. 66. 



82 



68. Vanilla Ice-cream. 

Boil in a saucepan one pint of milk with half a vanilla-bean; put 
in a vessel half a pound of powdered sugar and six ^g'g yolks, and with 
a spatula mix thoroughly for ten minutes; then add it to the boiling 
milk, stirring for two minutes longer, and pour the whole into a cop- 
per basin, placing it on a moderate stove to heat for five minutes, 
stirring at the bottom continually with the spatula, and being careful 
not to let it boil. Remove from off the fire, place it on a table, and 
add immediately one pint of sweet cream, still mixing it for two min- 
utes more; let cool off for thirty minutes, then strain through a sieve 
into an ice-cream freezer; put on the lid, and lay it in an ice-cream 
tub, filling the freezer all round with broken ice, mixed slightly with 
rock-salt; then turn the handle on the cover as briskly as possible for 
three minutes. Lift up the lid, and with a wooden spoon detach the 
cream from all around the freezer, and the bottom as well. Re-cover 

»3 



it, and turn the handle sharply for three minutes more; uncover, and 
detach the cream the same as before, being careful that no ice or salt 
drops in. Put the lid on, and repeat the same three times more. The 
ice-cream should by this time be quite firm, so have a cold dessert- 
dish with a folded napkin, dress the ice-cream over, and send to the 
table. 

This same ice-cream can be formed into a single brick by having 
a brick-shaped form, filling it with the cream, and pressing it down 
quickly with a spoon; cover closely, being careful that the form is 
completely filled, so that no salted water can penetrate into it. Put 
broken ice at the bottom of a pail, mixing in a little rock-salt, lay the 
form on top, covering it entirely with broken ice and salt; let freeze 
for one hour, remove, and bathe it in a vessel containing luke-warm 
water; wash off the ice and salt that adhere, and lift it out as quickly 
as possible; remove the cover, and turn it on a dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, lift up the mold, and send the ice-cream to the table. 

84 



6g, Chocolate Ice-cream. 

Prepare and cook exactly the same as for vanilla ice-cream (No. 
68); put in a saucepan two ounces of well-chopped cocoa and an 
ounce of powdered sugar, add to it half the cream preparation; place 
the pan on the stove, and with a pastry-whip stir briskly, and let boil 
for three minutes; take it from the fire, add it to the remaining half of 
cream, then mix the whole well together for two minutes. Strain 
through a fine sieve into an ice-cream freezer, let cool for thirty min- 
utes, then proceed to freeze it exactly the same as for the vanilla 
ice-cream, and serve it also the same. 



85 



70. Coffee Ice-cream, 

Put in a vessel half a pound of powdered sugar and six ^gg yolks;

site direction from the first time; after five minutes, detach from the 
sides as before, and repeat for the third time the turning process. 
Finally lift off the cover, and detach the cream from all around, and 
it will now be thoroughly firm, so coyer it again, and let it rest. Beat 
up to a froth one gill of sweet cream as for No. 65; take a glass or 
silver stand, and with an ice-cream spoon remove the cream from the 
freezer, spoonful by spoonful, and dress it in the centre of the bowl, 
keeping it as high as possible, and giving it a pretty, pyramid shape. 
Fill a paper cornet with the whipped cream, cut off the point, and

immediately with the lid, and place the freezer in a narrow ice-cream 
tub, filling the latter all round with broken ice mixed with rock-salt; 
then with the handle on the cover turn as sharply as possible for three 
minutes; wipe the cover neatly, uncover, and with a wooden spoon 
detach the punch from the sides of the freezer, as also from the bot- 
tom; cover again, turn the handle for three minutes more, uncover, 
detach the punch as before, cover, and repeat this three times as ex- 
plained for the vanilla ice-cream (No. 6S). Have six cold dessert- 
plates covered with fancy papers, each one having an L. D. designed

a punch k la Frangaise ready, as directed, and let cool off. Pour 
it into a small freezer, cover it, and lay it in a wooden tub filled 
with chopped ice all around. Sprinkle the ice well with rock-salt, 
and with the hands turn the freezer sharply around in opposite di- 
rections. While doing this, stop every two minutes to detach the 
punch from around the freezer (using a spatula), so that it will be 

104 



perfectly firm. If sharply handled, fifteen minutes will suffice to 
freeze it thoroughly, then serve in six punch-glasses, dividing it 
equally. 

89. Punch a la Czarina^ Hot. 

Place in a copper or tin vessel one pound of granulated sugar, half 
a pint of Swiss kirsch^ four ounces of St. Croix rum, and two ounces

leaf, mixing well with the whip for one minute. Have ready a seam- 
less jelly-bag (which can be purchased ready made), tie it on a jelly- 
stand, or if none handy, two kitchen chairs will answer the purpose. 
Stir the preparation, and when coming to a boil, set it back to a 



io8 



cooler part of the stove to prevent it overflowing ; stir, while boiling, 
for six minutes. Place a vessel under the jelly-bag, remove the pan 
from the fire, and pour the whole into the bag, immediately adding to 
it half a pint of good sherry wine, and a teaspoonful of burned 
sugar (No. 102). Let it drain into the vessel, then return it to the 
bag, placing another vessel underneath, then let it drain through for 
fully two hours. Have a quart jelly-mold, pour the jelly from the 
vessel into it, and set it aside in a cool place for two hours, then put 
it into the ice-box to harden for two hours more. Prepare a cold des- 
sert-dish, and after dipping the mold lightly and carefully to near its 
edge in lukewarm water, take it up immediately, and turn it onto 
the dish, wiping neatly the latter all around, then send to the table.

94 • H<yw to Make Black Cojff^ee. 

Take six light tablespoonfuls of coffee-beans \ grind them in a mill 
neither too coarse nor too fine. Have a well -cleaned French coffee- 
pot, put the coffee on the filter, with the small strainer over, then pour 
on a pint and a half of boiling water, little by little, recollecting, at 
the same time, that too much care cannot be taken to impress on those 
making the coffee, the necessity of having the water boiling thor- 
oughly, otherwise it were as useless to attempt the feat as to try and 
raise musk-melons at the North Pole, notwithstanding that the coffee 
be of the very first quality. When all the water is consumed put on 
the cover, and let infuse slightly, but on no account must it boil again; 
then serve in six after-dinner cups. Coffee should never be prepared 
more than five minutes before the time to serve. 



Ill 



95. Cafe au Lait {Coffee -with Milk). 

Have a clean French coffee-filter ready on the hot range; place in 
it four and a half ounces of freshly ground coffee, as for No. 94; then 
gradually pour over it, all around, half a pint of boiling water; let 
rest for three minutes, then gradually pour over two pints and a half 
more of boiling water (taking special care that, under no circumstances, 
should it be allowed to boil again after the water has been poured 
over). When all dripped down, pour it into a hot coffee-pot. Take 
three pints of good, freshly and thoroughly heated milk (but do not 
boil it), pour it into a hot pitcher, send to the table with six hot cups 
^ caf^ au laity pouring into each cup half coffee and half milk.

96. Cafe Glace {Iced Coffee), 

Prepare one quart of coffee as for No. 94, and also one quart of 
thoroughly heated milk (not boiled). Pour both coffee and milk into 
a small ice-cream freezer. Sweeten with three tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar; tightly cover the freezer, place it in a tub containing 
broken ice and rock-salt a little higher than the height of the coffee, 
then sharply turn it by the handle of the cover, in different directions, 
for five or six minutes; neatly wipe the cover of the freezer all around 
to avoid that any ice should fall in ; and with the aid of a ladle pour it 
into a pitcher, and serve with six coffee-glasses, and powdered sugar 
separately. 



"3 



97- The a la Russe {Russian Ted), 

Place in a tea-pot three heaped tablespoonfuls of English-breakfast 
tea; pour over a little boiling water, just sufficient to cover the tea, 
about two tablespoonfuls; let infuse for one minute, then draw the 
water out, but do not use it. Pour in half a pony of good, old 
Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water; let infuse for four min- 
utes, and then serve in cup, with a decanter of old Jamaica rum sepa- 
rately, thin slices of lemon and powdered sugar. 

This is the old Russian style. Later fashion is to flavor it with a 
little vanilla flavor and a few drops of lemon juice.

98. Hotu to Make Chocolate. 

Select three-quarters of a pound of good chocolate (Maillard's is 
preferable), break it into pieces, and put them in a saucepan on the 
stove with half a pint of boiling water; stir well with a wooden spoon, 
and when the chocolate is thoroughly dissolved pour one quart of 
boiling water over, using a quart of milk instead of the water when 
chocolate and milk is desired. Let it cook well for ten minutes, then 
serve.

99- Egg-Nog. 

Have a punch-bowl sufficiently large to hold at least three quarts. 

Crack eight very fresh eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, 
and then with the aid of a wire-whip sharply beat up the yolks in a 
bowl with eight tablespoonfuls of fine powdered sugar; then pour in 
one pint of Jamaica rum and two quarts of fresh milk, continually 
stirring with the whip while pouring in the milk; when all added, 
sharply beat with the whip again for two and a half to three minutes. 

Now beat up the whites in a bowl to a very stiff froth, and then 
pour it over the egg-nog. Place the bowl in a cool place, and serve 
when desired with six fine tumblers. 



ii6 



loo. Champagne Punch, 

Have a pretty champagne bowl large enough to hold three quarts. 

Prepare a pot of Oolong tea (by preference) the equivalent of two 
teacupfuls; lay it aside until cool, without placing it on the ice, etc. 
Pour one pony of eurak into the bowl (which can be obtained at Park 
& Tilford's, Acker, Merrall & Condit's or, I think, at any pharma- 
cist's), two wineglassfuls of Rhein wine, one pony of brandy, one 
pony of maraschino, one bottle of cold plain soda, and one quart of 
champagne, and then strain in the prepared tea also. Mix the whole 
thoroughly together with a ladle; then put in the punch a piece of 
clean and clear ice of about one pound. Peel a fine, medium-sized, 
sound banana, slice it into thin slices, scatter them all over the punch. 
Neatly peel and slice, also, a fine, juicy, sound orange, and spread the 
slices all over the punch, and then send it to the table with six fine 
punch-glasses.

I02. Burned Sugar. 

Put into a small iron omelet-pan half a pound of granulated sugar, 
and place on a slow stove to burn thoroughly for thirty minutes. Re- 
move the pan to the table to cool slightly for five minutes, and then 
add half a pint of boiling water, mixing well with an iron spoon. Re- 
place the pan on the stove, and boil for five minutes, stirring continu- 
ally; then strain the sugar through a sieve into a vessel, and put in a 
cold place to cool thoroughly. Pour it into a bottle, and use when 
required. Burned sugar prepared this way will keep in perfect 
condition for several weeks.

103. Stewed Apples. 

Take six fine, sound Middletown pippin apples, peel them neatly, 
and with an apule-corer core them thoroughly, then cut each apple 
into four quarters, and lay them in a saucepan with a pint of cold water, 
adding half a pound of granulated sugar. When the contents of the 
pan come to a boil, skim well, and then flavor with the juice of half 
an orange, or the same quantity of lemon, and a saltspoonful of ground 
cinnamon can also be added. When flavored, let cook for five minutes 
longer, and with a spatula stir slowly from the bottom to avoid mash- 
ing the apples. Remove from the fire, pour into a china bowl, and 
cool off" thoroughly before serving.
