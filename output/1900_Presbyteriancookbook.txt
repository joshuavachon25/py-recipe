COMPILED BY THE 

Ladies of the First Presbuterian Church, 

OF MCKEESPORT, PA. 



We may live without poetry, music and art; 
We may live without conscience and live without heart; 
We may live without friends; we may live without books; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks." 

' He may live without books, — what is knowledge but grieving? 
He may live without hope, — what is hope but deceiving? 
He may live without love, — what is passion but pining? 
But where is the man that can live without dining ? "

Introduction. 



In presenting this book to the public, the ladies of the First Presbyterian 
Church, of McKeesport, Pennsylvania, return thanks to all who have 
assisted them. 

Recipes that have been tried and proved were solicited, collected and 
are herein contained. Having been gathered from so many persons and 
various places, some subjects seem redundant in material, while others are 
sparsely treated or overlooked entirely; but with all these mistakes and short- 
comings we feel the book is worth what is asked for it. 

We have aimed to have the name of each contributor affixed to one or 
more of her recipes, except in those cases where contributors preferred their 
names should not appear. 

It has been our aim in preparing this volume to make it convenient 
in form, attractive in appearance, and more especially useful in matter, and 
by the proceeds of its sale to help with the interior furnishings of the 
new church. 

If it in any way proves a guide to the novice in housekeeping, as well as 
a help to the more experienced, and in so doing contributes in a small way 
to the welfare of their fellow creatures, as well as to the revenues of a 
worthy cause, their labors will not have been in vain.

PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



Soups. 



sour WITH STOCK— Under this 
head are included all the varieties of 
soup made from beef, veal, mutton 
or poultry. In iireparinj;- soup stock, 
the desired ol)ject is to obtain from 
the meat all the nutritive and flavor- 
inji: (jualities contained in the lean 
parts and in the bones. To accom- 
plish this the meat should be wiped 
well and cut into small pieces: this 
is to expose as large a surface as 
possible to the action of the heat and 
water Break or saw the bones, also, 
into small pieces, and soak both 
meat and bones in cold soft water, 
allowing a quart of water to every 
pound of soup material. Having 
soaked the meat half an hour off the 
fire, place the kettle on the Ijack of 
the range for another half hour, af- 
ter which the water can be slowly 
heated to l)oiling. The kettle for 
soup-making should have a tight 
cover, so that no steam can escape, 
or so very little that it will not di- 
minish the (luantity of water to any 
extent. The water should be soft, 
since hard water hardens the meat 
and thus imprisons the .iuices. No 
salt is added for the same reason. 

The scum that rises with the boil- 
ing contains nothing luiclean. unless 
the meat has not been properly 
Avaslied; and. although uninviting- 
looking, it should not be skimmed 
off. for it contains much that is nu- 
tritious. When the liquid has fully 
reached the boiling point, set the ket- 
tle ))ack where it will gently bub- 
ble for altout six hours. Now strain 
the stock and set it away to cool as 
rapiilly as possible, and the next day 
remove the fat. which will have 
hardened on the to]). Or if the stock 
is wanted at once, pour into a bowl 
mitil nearly full and carefully add 
cold Avater until the fat runs over 
(set the bowl in a deep plate or dish 



to contain the grease) and you can 
return the stock to the kettle for re- 
heating and seasoning. 

There should not be more than one 
pound of bone to three pounds of 
meat, but if more bone is used, 
make the proportion of water less 
than a quart to a pound. 



MEAT FOR STOCK-Stock may 
either be made of only one kind of 
meat or of several kinds, and it often 
happens that the greater the variety 
of meats employed the l:»etter the 
flavor of the soup will be. Beef is 
the most valuable and generally the 
cheapest meat to buy for soup. The 
parts used for different kinds of 
soups are as folloAvs: For bouillon 
or consomme, the roimd, flank, 
shoulder or brisket, and for a clear 
beef soup, the neck, cheek, leg, shin 
or any scraggy part beside the bones. 
A shin or leg will be a cheap piece 
to use. Butchers do not break these 
pieces small enough to use and they 
should be thoroughly washed before 
using. The I'ound need not be wash- 
ed, but may, instead, be wiped with 
a wet towel. 

Poultiy is of great A'alue in making 
stock. After the fowl is prepared 
and cut in pieces, place in a steAV- 
pan that will hold it, coA'er with cold 
Avater and heat sloAAiy to the boiling 
point. Let it then simmer on the 
back of the range luitil the meat is 
tender, skimming off all the scum, 
so that the .soiip will l)e light. Re- 
move the fat as in beef stock. The 
meat of the foAvl can be used in 
many ways. The stock can be used 
as the basis for a large variet.v of 
cream soiips. 

Any kind of game, A-eai or mutton 
can be used and make delicious 
smooth soups. 



14 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



TO CLEAR STOCK— When a clear 
soup is desired, tlie stock may be 
clarified by the whites aud shells of 
eggs, one being sufhcient to clear 
two qnarts of stock. Beat the white 
slightly and put it and the crushed 
shell into the cold stock, heat it slow- 
ly to boiling and boil ten minutes; a 
thick scum will then have formed. 
Draw the kettle back on the range, 
and add half a cupful of cold water. 
Let stand ten minutes, when strain 
through a napkin, placing a fine 
wire sieve over the napkin to catch 
the scum and shells which would 
otherwise clog the napkin. 



COLORING FOR STOCK— There aie 
various methods suggested for col- 
oring soups, the simplest, possibly, 
being that suggested by Mrs. Ewing 
during her cooking lessons. Let a 
portion of the strained stock boil 
down in a frying pan until it 
browns; this is what she terms "car- 
amel." If the first portion does not 
make the soup brown as desired, re- 
peat, each time adding soup after 
the "caramel" has been made. 

Take equal parts flour and butter 
and brown in a frying pan, stirring 
constantly to prevent burning; when 
well browned, add to the soup. Beef 
extract and soiip paste prepared liy 
the meat product manufacturers are 
also recommended for this purpose. 



THICKENING FOR STOCK— When 
thickening is needed for clear soiip, 
arrow I'oot, corn starch or fine ground 
tapioca should be used, arrow root 
being the best when no trace of 
thickening is desired. Corn starch 
gives a little cloudiness to the soup, 
but is used in the same proportion, a 
tablespoonful to a quart of soup. 
Tapioca in the same proportion can 
be sprinkled into the boiling soup; 
this leaA^es small grains in the. soup, 
but to many these are not objection- 
able. 



STOCK SOUPS— The every-day soups 
are simply made from bits of cold 
meat and the bones left from roasts, 
broils and boiled meats. The better 



way is on Tuesday to take all the 
bones that have been left from Sat- 
urday; cover them with cold water; 
bring to boiling point and simmer 
gently for three hours; add twelve 
cloves, an onion, a bay leaf, a carrot, 
parsley, or any similar greens that 
you have at hand. Cook slowly for 
another hour, strain and put away. 
This soup may be heated the next 
day and served perfectly clear, or 
you may put a poached egg in each 
soup plate and pour over it the hot, 
clear soup, or jou may add boiled 
macaroni or chopped vegetables. 



BARLEY SOUP— Two poimds of shin 
of beef, one large bunch of parsley, 
four onions, three large potatoes, 
one-quarter pound of barley, four 
quarts of cold water, salt and pep- 
per to ta.ste. Simmer gently for four 
hours. 



SCOTCH BROTH— Cover a neck of 
mutton with cold water, quarter one 
turnip and carrot and grate one- 
quarter of each; cut the remaining 
quarters in small pieces and put the 
whole in the pot with the mutton. 
Add one large onion and half a small 
cabbage cut fine. Simmer slowly for 
three hours. Half an hour before it 
is time to serv« add half a cup of 
barley, and salt to taste. This 
makes an excellent broth. 
i 

AMBER SOUP— A large soup bone 
(two poimds), a chicken, a small slice 
of ham, an onion, two sprigs of par- 
sley, half a small carrot, half a 
small parsnip, half a stick of celery, 
three cloves, pepper, salt, a gallon 
of cold water, whites and shells of 
two eggs, and caramel for coloring. 
Boil slowly for five hours, beef, 
chicken and ham; add the vegetables 
and cloves into an earthen bowl, and 
let remain over night. Next day re- 
move cake of fat on the top; take out 
the jelly, avoiding the settlings, and 
mix intx) it the beaten whites of the 
eggs with the shells; boil quickly 
for half a minute, then pass through 
a jelly bag. When ready to serve,

Innich of celery, small piece of onion; 
boil celery in one ])int water from 
thirty to forty minutes. Season with 
red pepper. — Mrs. Theo. Demmler. 

CREAM OF CLAMS— Two dozen 
clams, two cups of milk, two table 
spoonfuls of fiour. two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, one sni.all onion cho])- 
ped, one cup of cream, pepi)er, salt 
and a dash of nutnu^g. Wash the 
clams and put them in a pan on the 



18

range. When the shells open, re- 
move clams and strahi the liquor. 
Chop the clams fine and rub through 
sieve. Mal^e a thiclvening by melting 
the butter and stirring in tlie flour, 
taking care it does not brown. Add 
the milli which has been scalded 
with the onion in it, and pepper and 
nutmeg. Taste and see if salt is 
needed. Add the clam pulp and a 
pint of thin liquor just before serv- 
ing. Heat through Avell and add 
your cream as you pour into the tur- 
een. If you wish it foamy, beat it a 
little. For lunches serve with a tea- 
spoonful of sheriy in each cup. 



CARROT SOUP— Into two quarts of 
nicely seasoned stock put some car- 
rots cut into small dice; add to the 
soup, salt, if necessary, a tiny pinch 
of cayenne pepper — use it cautiously 
— and one tablespoonful of grated 
carrot, one of good vinegar, and one 
of caramel. Serve when the carrots 
are perfectly tender. 

EXCELLENT TOMATO SOUP-Place 
six or eight medium-sized tomatoes 
in a saucepan to cook; add a piece 
of soda the size of a bean, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, two cupfuls of water 
and one and a half cu]ifuls of milk. 
Mix one tablespoonful of tlour with 
a portion of the tomato and add it 
to the soup while boiling. When the 
tomatoes are done strain and add 
one cupful of whipped cream. Serve 
with rolled crackers. 



CREAM OF SPINACH— Or cream of 
celery, green peas or corn, are all 
made in the same way. Roil your 
vegetable till it is quite soft; press it 
through a sieve, atiu three ciips of 
milk to two cups of vegetables, 
strained, and thicken with the yollcs 
of two eggs well beaten; season with 
pepper and salt and a tablespoonful 
of butter, which is aiided bit by bit. 
Cook just long enough to set the 
egg, otherwise it Avill curdle. Just 
before serving stir in at least half a 
cup of cream, and not more than a 
whole cup 



These soups are all delicate and 
nutritious, and if made perfectly 
smooth are very desirable at a din- 
ner. Half a cup of cream will add 
but five cents to their cost. 



ONION SOUP— This has the merit of 
being "quick and easy." Chop three 
large onions and fry them in a table- 
spoonful of butter till soft and 
brown; then slowly add three table- 
spoonfuls of flour and stir till it is 
cooked. Add little by little a pint of 
boiling water and stir all the time so 
as to keep it smooth. To three on- 
ions use three potatoes; boil, mash 
and stir slowly into a quart of boil- 
ing milk. Put all the ingredients to- 
gether, mixing Avell, and when in the 
tureen add chopped parsley or oyster 
crackers which have been heated in 
the oven with a bit of butter on 
each. 



CORN SOUP — Delicious corn soup is 
made as follows: One pint of grat- 
ed corn, the broth in which a chicken 
has been boiled (of which there 
should be nearly a quart), one cupful 
of cream, one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, one tablespoonful of flour, pep- 
per and salt to taste. P>oil the cous 
first in the chicken broth, and after- 
ward the corn, till very soft, press- 
ing through the colander Avhen suffi- 
ciently cooked. Rub butter and flour 
to a paste, thin with a little broth, 
and stir gradually in the soup. Whip 
the cream to a light froth and add 
just before serving. 



PEACH PUREE— A fruit puree is 
served frequently as first course at 
a luncheon. I do not know that it is 
ever used in winter, hot bouillon, 
consomme or C-lear soup being pre- 
ferable. Canned fruits may be used. 
Press the peaches through a sieve; 
measure, and to each pint allow one 
pint of water, half a teaspoonful of 
bitter almond flavoring and the juice 
of a lemon; bring to boiling point; 
add one tablespoonful of arrow- 
root that has been moistened in half 
a cupful of cold water; stir until the 
mixture again boils and stand aside

to cool. Wlion ready to serve, pour 
this into tumblers. Then fill the 
tumblers with cracked ice or stand 
them in small bowls packed Avith 
ice, and send to the table. 



DUMPLINGS FOR BOILED DIN- 
NER— One pint flour, measured be- 
fore sifted, one-half teaspoonful 
soda, one teaspoonful cream of tar- 
tar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one 



teaspoonful sugar. Put all into a 
sieve, mix well and run through; 
then add a very scant cupful of 
sweet milk; .sprinkle flour on the 
I)read-board, and after stirring the 
dough into a smooth ball, place on 
the board and roll out to half an 
inch in thickness, and cut with a cut- 
ter the size of a napkin ring. Cook 
the dumplings in the meat broth, 
exactly ten minutes. — Mrs. Osmond 
Hutchison.

Fish and Oysters. 



DIGESTIBILITY OF COMMON FISH 
— All wliite-fleshed fisli are supposed 
to be more easily digested than tlir>se 
with pink flesh. The white-fleshed 
fish are such as cod, rock bass, white 
fish, halibut, aud some of the smaller 
fish. The pink-fleshed fish are those 
having fat distributed throughout 
the body, as salmon, sturgeon and 
catfish. 



BAKED FISH— Make a dressing of 
bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of 
minced onion, some chopped parsley, 
a little butter, one tablespoonful of 
chopped suet, pepper and salt aud 
a beaten egg. Stuff the fish and sew 
or tie securely. Place in the pan 
with some hot water; lay pieces of 
pork on top Avith a little pepper and 
salt, and bake, basting very often. 



FISH TURBOT-Steam or boil the 
fish and then pick in small pieces and 
free from all bones. 



CREAM FOR DRESSING OF FISH 
TURBOT-To one pound of fish a 
small cup of flour, two tablespoonfuls 
of butter and beat to a cream; heat 
about one pint of milk or cream; 
then add butter and flour, season to 
taste with parsley chopped fine, on- 
ion, nutmeg, red and white pepper, 
and salt; put into dishes alternately 
fish and dressing, then sprinkle with 
bread crumbs and bake until brown. 
Serve hot.— Mrs. Harvey Wilson, Bos- 
ton, Pa. 



TURBOT A LA CREME-Three 
pounds of halibut, or cod, boiled 
with plenty of salt; remove skin aud 
bones and flake. Boil one bunch 
of parsley and one large onion in a 
little water to extract the flavor; take 
out and tliicken with three table- 
spoonfuls of flour; then add it to one 
quart of cream and milk together 
(more cream improves) and one-half 
cup or outter. Put alternate layers 



of fish and sauce in a deep buttered 
dish (sauce on top); cover with bread 
crumbs and bake till brown. 



RED MULLET— Red mullet, a fish too 
seldom found upon the taule, is very 
handsome in appearance and delicate 
in flavor. 



RED MULLET BAKED— Wash the 
mullet and rub it well with lemon 
juice; then put it in a pan with a 
large mushroom, an onion, some 
sprigs of parsley, all chopped fine, a 
saltspoonful each of salt and pepper 
and a cupful of cooking wine. Bake 
in a moderate oven for half an hour, 
basting constantly, and serve with 
the sauce poured over it. 



BOILED HALIBUT WITH HOL- 
LANDAISE SAUCE— Cover three 
pounds of halibut with lukewarm 
water, salted and acidulated with 
vinegar or lemon juice. Bring quick- 
ly to the boiling point; simmer half 
an hour, drain, remove the bone from 
the center, and the skin. Place on 
a napkin; garnish with potato cro- 
quettes and parboiled oysters. Place 
parsley in the space occupied by the 
bone. Serve with Hollandaise souce. 



HOLLANDAISE SAUCE (for fish)- 
Rub one-half cup butter to a cream. 
Add the yolks of two eggs, one at a 
time, and beat well; stir in the juice 
of half a lemon, one saltspoonful salt 
and a pinch of cayenne pepper. 
When ready to serve, add one-half 
cup boiling Avater; place the bowl in 
a pan of boiling water or in the top 
of a teakettle and cook until thick as 
a custard, stirring all the time. 



LOBSTER CROQUETTES-Two cups 
finely chopped lobster, one saltspoon- 
ful salt, one of mustard, a trifle 
cayenne; mix with cup (one cup) 
cream sauce. Make into croquettes, 
roll in beaten egg and cracker 
crumbs, and fiy in hot lard. 



24 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



SALMON CROQUETTES— One cup of 
milk, one can of salmon chopped fine, 
three tablespoonfnls of butter, two 
tablespoonfiils flour, one and a half 
cups of cracker crumbs; roll, dip in 
egg. then roll in crumbs and fry in 
butter. 



CREAM SALMON— One can of salmon 
minced fine, drain off the liquor 
and throw away. For the dressing 
boil one pint of milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, salt and pepper to 
taste. Have ready one pint of fine 
bread crumbs, place a layer in the 
bottom of the dish, then a layer of 
fish, then a layer of dressing and so 
on, having crumbs for the last layi?r. 
Bake till brown. 



DEVILED CRABS— To the meat of 
one dozen hard shell crabs boiled 
fifteen minutes and chopped, add 
three tablespoonfuls stale bread 
crumbs, one-half wine glass cream, 
yolks of three hard boiled eggs chop- 
ped, one talilespoonful butter, pep- 
per and salt to taste. Mix all to- 
gether and put back into the shells, 
sprinkle with fine bread crumbs, 
small bits of butter and brown in a 
quick oven. 



CREAMED CODFISH and mashed po- 
tatoes make a simple, inexpensive 
breakfast or luncheon dish. Cook 
the codfish, and to about two cup- 
fuls of cold, fiaked fish add a good 
cupful of cream sauce. Spread a 
thin layer of the freshly prepared 
mashed potatoes over the bottom of a 
•well buttered hot platter, and of the 
remainder make a wall around the 
edge. Pour in the codfish, decorate 
with parsley and serve. 



CLAM COCKTAILS— Clam and oyster 
cocktails are made much after the 
same fashion. In my opinion they 
are not wholesome. Put into a tum- 
bler six small clams or oysters; add 
two drops of tabasco sauce, a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice, a teaspoon- 
ful of onion juice (to the oysters a 
saltspoonful of salt; four table- 



spoonfuls of tomato ketchup; mis 
thoroughly; stand in a bowl packed 
with cracked ice. and serve in this 
way. The cocktails should be mixed 
at least a half hour before serving 
time, and kept in a refrigerator. If 
they are then put in bowls, packed 
with cracked ice and sent to the table 
they will be in good condition. They 
are eaten with an oyster fork. 



CLAM CHOWDER may be made with- 
out tomatoes. Have the clams chop- 
ped fine. Cover the bottom of your 
pan with a layer of bacon; add a layer 
of potatoes cut into blocks, a sprink- 
ling of cayenne pepper, then the 
clams, and then another layer of po- 
tatoes and clams until you have the 
desired quantity. Cover, and cook 
slowly for thirty minutes. Add two 
sea biscuits, broken, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, and serve vei-y hot. 



TO PICKLE AND CAN SHAD ROE— 
Wash the roe, throw them into boil- 
ing water; add a tea spoonful of salt, 
a slice of onion and two bay leaA'es. 
Cook gently for half an hour, drain 
and dry, arranging them neatly in 
lage glass jars. Heat sufficient 
white wine vinegar to cover. To each 
quart add one ounce of grated horse- 
raddish. a tablespoonful of whole 
mustard seed and half a dozen cloves. 
Pour this over the shad roe and seal 
the jars while hot. 



CODFISH CUTLETS- Select good, 
solid codfish; pick apart one pound, 
throw into cold water, wash thor- 
oughly, change the water three or 
four times, then put it into fresh 
water and over the fire until it just 
reaches the boiling point; drain and 
press free from moisture. Mix with 
this an equal quantity of mashed po- 
tatoes; add a saltspoonful of pepper, 
the yolk of an e^g and a tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Mix thoroughly; form 
into cutlets, dip in egg- and bread 
crumbs and fry in smoking-hot fat. 
Pour the tomato sauce in the dish, 
arrange the cutlets and send to the 
table. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



25 



SALMON CROQUETTES— To make 
croquettes from canned salmon, mash 
and drain the sahnon; put half a pint 
of milk over the tire; rub together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two 
of flour; add to the milk and cook un- 
til thick. Take from the tire and add 
the yolks of two eggs. Cook for just 
a moment longer. To the salmon add 
a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, a teaspoonful 
of onion juice, just a grating of nut- 
meg and a dash of pepper. Mix the 
meat and white sauce together and 
turn out to cool. When cold form In- 
to cylinders, dip in beaten egg. then 
roll in bread crumbs and fiy in 
smoking-hot fat. 



LOBSTER CUTLETS— Into a cupful 
of thick white sauce stir the beaten 
yolk of an egg. a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice and two cupfuls of 
chopped lobster meat. Shape into 
cutlets, egg and breadcrumb each one 
and fry in deep fat. 



CODFISH BALLS— Two eggs well 
beaten, one-half cup of shredded cod- 
fish, one cup of chopped meat, one 
cup cold oatmeal or shredded whole 
wheat biscuit. Mix well, make into 
balls and fry in hot lard or half but- 
ter. 



LOBSTER CUTLETS— Make a cream 
sauce of a heaping tablespoonful 
butter, a rounding tablespoonful 
flour, a cup of milk. Melt the butter. 
add the flour, stir until cooked and 
slowly add the milk, stirring until 
smooth and thick. Take from the 
fire, add a Avell beaten egg. two cup- 
fuls of freshly boiled lobster meat 
cutveiy fine. and season to taste with 
salt, pepper, lemon juice, a little 
finely minced parsley and a dash of 
cayenne. Let this mixture boil up 
once, then spread out on a buttered 
platter to cool. When quite cold 
mould into the form of cutlets, dip 
in beaten egg. then in fresh bread 
crumbs and fry in deep fat, or lard, 
until it is a delicate brown. Insert a 
small claw in each piece to make it 



look like a cutlet and serve on a 
napkin garnished with lemon and 
parsley. 



FRIED OYSTERS— Take fine large 
oysters, free from all the small par- 
ticles of shell, put them into a colan- 
der and pour over a little Avater to 
rinse them; then place them on a 
clean towel and dry them; have ready 
some cracker made veiy fine, which 
season with a little salt, black and 
cayenne pepper of equal proportions. 
Beat as many eggs and cream, mixed, 
as will moisten all the oysters re- 
quired; then with a fork dip each one 
in the egg and lay them on the crack- 
er, and with the back of a spoon pat 
the cracker close to the oyster, lay 
them on a dish and so continue till all 
are done. Put in a frying pan an 
equal portion of butter and lard, boil- 
ing hot. then put in as many oysters 
as the pan will hold Avithout allowing 
them to touch, and fry quickly to a 
light broAvn on both sides. A few 
minutes will cook them. Sent to 
table hot. 



STEAMED OYSTERS OX TOAST— 
Drain and wash the oysters. Put 
them with their liquor into a sauce- 
pan and cook until the oysters are 
plump, shaking the pan frequently 
to prevent burning. Drain off the 
liquor, season witli salt, pepper and 
butter, and pile on nicely browned 
slices of toast. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS— Place in a 
pudding dish a layer of cracker 
crumbs, then cover with a layer of 
oysters, from which all the liquor 
has been strained. alternating 
crackers and oysters till the dish 5s 
filled, finishing with the cracker 
crumbs; over each layer of oyster.s 
sprinkle pepper, salt and bits of but- 
ter; pour over the whole a pint of 
cream or rich milk; bake about three 
quarters of an hour. 



FRIED OYSTERS— Look the oysters 
over carefully to see that there are 
no shells, salt them. Have ready 



26 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-COOK. 



very finely rolled and roasted bread 
crum'bs, and beaten egg if the oysters 
are very small, and they are the 
best; take tbree or four together; 
dip first into the crumbs then into 
■the egg then again into the crumb, 
rolling into the shape of a large 
oyster, being careful that every 
part is well covered with both egg 
and crumbs. Have ready boiling 
lard in a very small kettle. Lay the 
oyster on a wire spoon or straining 
dipper and suumerge in the hot lavd 
till it is nicely browned. Sometimes 
two may be done at once, but ihey 
brown so quickly it does not require 
long. If a quart kettle is used ittakes 
but little more lard than the usual 
manner for frying. If desired these 
may be done at any time in the after- 
noon and warmed carefully in a 
dripping pan when they are to be 
used or served.— M. M. E. 



OYSTER OMELET— Stew one dozen 
oysters in their own liquor, if pos- 
sible, if not, use a very little water; 
roll two or three lumps of butter, 
size of butternuts, in flour, put in and 
let come to a boil; season well with 
pepper and salt. Talie out the oysters 
and chop them, and if necessary to 
thicken, add a little flour to the sauco. 
Put back the oysters and set on back 
part of the stove. Beat four eggs 
very light, and addtwotablespoonfuls 
of milk or cream. Fi-y in a well but- 
tered frying pan. When done, re- 
move to a hot platter or deep plate, 
and pour the oyster sauce over thorn. 
Serve hot. 



OYSTER PIE— Make a rich paste and 
lay in a deep dish, turn a teacup 
down in the center; this will draw 
the liquor under it and prevent it 
from boiling over; it also keeps the 
upper crust from falling in and be- 
coming clammy. Pour in the oys- 
ters, add a little salt, pepper, but- 
ter and sprikle flour over; make a 
wide incision in the upper crust, so 
that when the pie is nearly done you 
can pour in half a teacupful of cream. 
Put in the oven as soon as made. 



OYSTERS ON TOAST— TWo cups of 
milk and a large piece of butter; 
when this boils put in one or one and 
one-half pints of oysters and cook 
until the edges begin to curl; pour 
into this one scant tablespoonful of 
flour mixed thoroughly with cold 
milk or water; toast bread and lay in 
a dish, pour the oysters on and serve 
hot. 



LITTLE PIGS IN BLANKETS— Take 
as many large oysters as a.e wished, 
wash and dry them thoroughly with a 
clean towel. Have some fat bacon 
cut in very thin slices, covor each 
oyster with them, and pin on with 
wooden toothpicks. Boil or roast 
them until the bacon is crisp and 
brown. Do not remove toothpicks. 
Serve hot. 



CREAMED OYSTERS— To one-half 
tablespoonful butter, melted in a 
saucepan, add one heaping table- 
spoonful flour. Cook a few moments 
and stir in gradually one cup hot 
milk; season with salt, pepper and 
teaspoonful celery salt. Wash and 
pick over carefully one pint fine oys- 
ters, boil them in their own liquor 
until plump, drain and pour over 
them the sauce. 



ESCALLOPED OYSTERS— Cover the 
bottom of a dish with oysters, 
sprinkle them with pepper and a 
little salt, then place a thin layer of 
crackers rolled very fine; put over 



the crackers a little butter and a' 
little of the liquor of the oysters. So 
continue until the dish is full, finish- 
ing with a layer of cracker. Bake 
three quarters of an hour. 



> 



BAKED HADDOCK WITH FRIED 
OYSTERS— Stuff a haddock with a 
cupful of breadcrumbs mixed with 
melted butter, a teaspoonful each of 
chopped onion and cucumber pickles, 
and the yolk of an egg. Season with 
salt and pepper. Truss the fish in 
the shape of an S. Dredge with 
flour, cover with slices of salt pork 
and bake until brown. Garnish with

fried oysters ancl lemon. Serve with 
tomato sauce. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS— Drain a 
quart of oysters, passing tlie liquor 
through a sieve. Mix some fine 
cracker crumbs with melted butter, 
and put in a baliing-dish alternate 
layers of oysters and cracker crumbs, 
moistened with the oyster liquor, 
and seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Bake in a hot oven. Garnish with 
parsley and triangles of toasted 
bread, and serve as soon as possible 
after being cooked. 



For half a dozen people, about six 
squares of toast and a pint of solid 
oysters will be required. Clean and 
drain the oysters from their liquor, 
put them with three tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a frying pan without water. 
As soon as heated they draw suffi- 
cient liquor. Stir them often, or 
shake the pan to prevent the oysters 
from adhering. Cook until the oys- 
ters are plump and the edges curl, 
add seasoning of salt and peppei', 
pour on the toast arranged on a hot 
platter and serve immediately. 



OYSTER SOUP— Take forty large 
oysters for this soup. One quart of 
milk, and enough of the strained 
liquor and cold Avater to make one 
pint; add this with a little salt and 
a large piece of butter to the milk, 
let it come to a boil, add the oysters 
and let it boil up once. If desired, 
thicken with a little rolled cracker. 



OYSTER CREAMS— Take one quart 
of milk, put on to boil. Chop fine one 
pint of oysters, heat them and melt 
in them one large tablespoonful of 
butter, rub two tablespoonfuls of flour 
in cold milk, add to the hot milk and 
cook five minutes; add salt and dash 
of caj^enne pepper to the ovsters; 
when ready to serve add the oysters 
to the hot milk. (This is delicious.)— 
Mrs. N. B. Sproat. 



FISH CROQUETTES— One pint cold 
boiled fish, free from skin and bone 
and minced fine, one pmt hot mash- 
ed potatoes, one tablespoonful but- 
ter, one half cup hot milk, one egg 
well beaten, pepper and salt and a 
little chopped parsley. Mix thor- 
oughly and let cool. When cold make 
into balls, dip into a beaten egg, roll 
in bread crumbs and fi-y in hot lard. 



BROILED SALT MACKEREL— Soak 

the fish over night in a large pan of 
luke-warm water placing the skin 
side uppermost. In the morning dry 
thoroughly and l)roil over hot coals. 
Spread with butter, lemon juice and 
chopped parsley. A little hot cream 
added just before sending to the table 
is an improvement. 



SALMON CROQUETTES— One can of 
salmon, two eggs. Mould and I'oll 
in cracker dust and fry in hot butter 
or lard.— Mrs. R. P. Miller, Home- 
stead, Pa.

Poultry and Game. 



TO ROAST A TURKEY— Select a 
young turkey; remove all the featli- 
ers carefully, singe it over a burning 
newspaper on the top of the stove; 
then ■•draw" it nicely, being careful 
not to break any of the internal or- 
gans; remove the crop carefully, 
and tie the neck close to the body by 
drawing the skin over it. Now rinse 
the inside of the turkey out with 
several Avaters, and in the next to 
the last mix a teaspoonful of baking 
soda, as oftentimes the inside of a 
fowl is very sour, especially if it is 
not freshly killed. Now. after wash- 
ing, Avipe the turkey dry. inside and 
out, with a clean cloth: rub the in- 
side with salt and the turkey is 
ready to stuff. Prepare bread or any 
preferred stuffing and till the body 

. and breast: soav up the opening with 
strong thread and tie the Avings and 
legs to the body: rub it over Avith a 
little soft butter, sprinkle salt and 
pepper over it and place it in a drip- 
ping pan with a cover. Pour into

often with butter and water mixed. 
— Mrs. W. T. Forrester. 



BEWITCHED VEAL— Three pounds 
of lean veal. one-Tialf pound salt pork, 
(fat), one nutmeg: (grated), one small 
onion, butter size of an egg, salt to 
taste, one-half tea spoonful red pep- 
per; chop all very fine and mix alto- 
gether with three well beaten eggs 
and one teaoupful of the water the 
veal has been boiled in. Make into a 
loaf and cover with bread crumbs. 
If made with cold veal, use cup of 
milk instead of the water. — Mrs. A. 
M. launders. 



VEAL CHEESE— Take equal quanti- 
ties of sliced boiled veal and sliced 
boiled tongue; pound each separately 
In a mortar, adding butter as you do 
so. Take a stone jar, mix them in it. 
Keep covered in a dry place. To be 
eaten at tea. in slices. 



^'EAL STEW— Cut four pounds veal 
into strips three inches long and one 
inch thick, peel twelve large pota- 
toes, and cut tbem into slices one inch 
thick, spread a layer of veal on the 
bottom of the kettle, sprinkle in a 
little salt and pepper, then a layer of 

' potatoes, then a layer of veal sea- 
soned as before; use up the veal thus. 
Over the last layer of veal put a layer 
of slices salt pork, and over the Avhole 
a layer of potatoes; pour on water 
until it rises an inch over the Avhole, 
cover it close, heat it fifteen minutes 
and simmer it an hour. 



TO SKIM HOT GRAVIES— Meat drip- 
pings while bot may have the fat 
removetl by adding a third a cup- 
ful of cold water. Tliis will make the 
fat rise and stiffen enough to be re- 
moved by dra^Aiug the edge of a 
brown paper across it, butcher's 
paper being best. The fat may also 
be skimmed off with a spoon, but this 
lemoves some of the gravy and, be- 
sides, is a slower process. 



JELLIED VEAL— Four or five pounds 
veal of hind knuckle; boil (witli bones) 



until (luite tender; shred the meat 
from bones with a fork, taking out 
all ligaments, etc.; boil the broth 
down until but an even pint is in the 
kettle; add salt, pepper, a little spice, 
cayenne and mustai'd to the broth, 
strain and mix thoroughlj' with the 
feiiredded meat and press into a 
square mould. Another way is to 
add a box of gelatine to about a 
(luart or three pints of broth and 
mix thoroughly with the meat. 

TO FRY PORK CHOPS.— Mix together 
sugar, salt and pepper, and season 
chops. Have frying pan hot; put in 
butter or pork drippings, fry chops 
until brown on both sides, then add 
a little water and let them simmer on 
back of range until tender. Fiy veal 
and lamb chops in the same manner 
emitting sugar, if not desired, but 
add milk instead of water after 
cooking. 



VEAL CUTLETS WITH TOMATOES 
—Wash two cutlets, season them 
with pepper and salt; liave ready 
.some hot lard and butter in a pan; 
put the meat into it and fry it on 
both sides to a nice l^rown; when 
done, take it up on a dish. Stew 
al)0Ut a quarter of a peck of toma- 
toes, drain, mash and season with 
red pepper and salt; pour the toma- 
toes into the pan with the gravy, af- 
ter the cutlets have been dished, 
and stir them well together. Pour 
them over the cutlets and send to 
the table. This dish is very much 
admired l)v manv. 



VEAL LOAF— Two pounds veal, one- 
fourth poimd bacon, chopped fine; 
add two eggs, fom- tablespoonfuls 
cream, one teaspoonful sage, salt 
and pepper to taste. Bake in slow 
oven for two hours. 



VP]AL LOAF— Three pounds veal 
(ground), one and one-half cups 
bread crumbs, one-half small onion, 
cut line; season with celery or celery 
salt, pepper to taste; two eggs, mix 
well, form in oblong loaf, garnish 



44 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



"With Ijread cruinljs and bake two 
hours.— Mi-.s. Theo. Demmler. 



BREAKFAST DISH— C'ho]) very line 
either cold beef, mutton or veal. To 
one teacni)ful allow the same quan- 
tity of grated liread, and if the latter 
is stale, soak it a few hours in warm 
milk and eliop with the meat; to this 
quantity add one egg, yolk and 
white, well beaten together, salt, 
pepper and, if liked, a very small 
onion chopped tine: mix well to- 
gether, flouring the hands, make into 
balls and fry in hot lard. 



TO KEEP :\IEATS-Wet a cloth with 
vinegar and wrap it around fresh 
meat and it will keep sweet several 
days. A very little salt may be 
sprinkled on the meat.— Mrs. j. C. 
Chalfant. 



CKOQUETTES-These are a sort of 
mincemeat dumpling. Take some 
cold veal, chicken, lobster or tender 
cold beef chopped tine; ])ut half a 
tablespoonful of butter in a sauce- 
pan on the tire; when melted, put in 
a piece of onion chopi)ed line, fry a 
little; add half a tablespoonful" of 
flour; when it browns, put in the 
mincemeat, stir it steadily and add 
salt and pepper; then add a gill and 
a half of broth, and set the pan a 
little off the lire to simmer; chop 
three stalks of parsley line, and mix- 
it in on the lire, stirring all the time; 
then break in two eggs, stirring- 
faster; in two or three minutes take 
it from the fire and set it to cool; 
thus far it has occupied about ten 
minutes; when the meat is cold sift 
some flour on the Ijoard, take a lump 
of mince the size of an egg. or larg- 
er, roll it in the fine flour, dip it in 
a cup of beaten egg. drain and roll it 
in the bread crumbs; have a quan- 
tity of boiling suet or dri])pings in 
a frying pan, and fry the croquettes 
in it for a couple of minutes till 
brown; put in a colander and let the 
fat drain off. 



of meat add three raw eggs, butter, 
salt, nutmeg and onions (a little salt 
is good); add the juice boiled down 
to aliout one-half cup, thickened a 
very little; make into small pyra- 
midal forms, roll in egg and cracker 
and fry in hot lard. Serve hot. 



BEEF CROQUETTES— Prepare two 
cupfuls of finely chopped cold beef, 
removing all gristle and fat. (Left- 
over steak, roast, stewed or boiled 
meat may be used in making cro- 
quettes); add two teacupfuls of 
mashed potatoes, one small onion 
chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, salt and peppei-, and one well- 
beaten egg; form into balls or cakes, 
dip into beaten egg, then roll in fine 
bread crumbs and fry in very hot 
fat. Fry to a rich brown. 

MEAT BALLS— One pound of beef 
and one-half pound of veal, ground 
very fine together with one onion; a 
small cup and a half of milk and 
two slices of l)read, soaked together 
one and one-half hours; then add 
two eggs, pe])per and salt to taste; 
add the meat and Avork well until it 
liecomes real smooth, then roll in 
small balls and fry in butter. Gravy 
can be made, if desired, by adding a 
little butter and flour and let brown, 
then add weak liouillon and stir well 
until smooth.— Mrs. AVilliam Ahlen. 

MUSHROOM PATTIES— Patties of 
mushrooms and sweetbreads. Take 
one pair of sweetbreads, one can, or 
one pint of mushrooms; prepare the 
sweetbreads in the usual way; after 
cooking, chop moderately fine, then 
add mushrooms. Take one pint of 
milk, bring it to boil, blend one 
tablespoonful of flour with two of 
butter, add salt, a uash of cayenne 
pepper, pour o-\er the sweetlireads 
and mushrooms, let heat slowly; fill 
pattie shell with the mixture.— Mrs. 
N. B. Sproat. 



CROQUETTES— Boil until very ten- 
der chicken or veal. To two pounds 



TOMATOES AND BEEF STEAK— 
One flank steak: salt and pepper; 
break bread crumbs over steak, then 
pour a can of tomatoes over this; 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



45 



season Avitli salt, pepper and one- 
fourth teaspoonful of allspice. Dot 
with small lumps of luitter, cover 
and bake one and one-half hoiu's, re- 
move cover and brown.— Mrs. R. B. 
Vincent, Dravosburg, Pa. 



BAKED MUTTOX CHOPS— Beat and 
trim the chops, roll each one in 
beaten egg and then in dried bread 
crumbs; put them in a dripping pan 
with a small lump of butter on each 
one; set in the oven, and, as they 
brown, baste every few minutes 
with boiling water and a little melt- 
ed butter. When nut brown (keep 
them hot) sprinkle with pepper and 
salt; thicken the gravy left in pan by 
adding browned tlour; pour over 
chops and serve.— Mrs. J. K. Young. 



SWEETBREADS spoil veiy quickly 
and for this reason should be at- 
tended to as soon as received from 
market. Throw in cold water for 
fifteen or twenty minutes, remove 
the pipes and membranes, cook in 
boiling salted water until thoroughly 
done — from twenty to thirty min- 
utes—then plunge into cold water to 
harden. They are now ready to be 
prepared as a tilling for jiatties. No 
matter what the subsequent mode 
of cooking may be, sweetbreads 
should always be par-boiled before 
using in any other form. Cut the 
sweetbread in small dice and pre- 
pare an equal or less amount of 
mushrooms. Cut canned mushrooms 
in half if small, quarter them if 
large. Make a rich cream sauce of 
an ounce of butter, a rounding table- 
spoonful of flour and half a pint of 
milk or half milk and half strained 
broth in which sweetlireads were 
cooked; season to taste with salt and 
pepper; heat sweetl)reads and mush- 
rooms thoroughly in this sauce; heat 
the shells thoroughly and quickly in 
a hot oven just at the moment of 
serving and till to overflowing with 
the mixture. 



BEEF ROLL— One pound chopped 
beef, two well-l)eaten eggs, three 
soda crackers rolled fine, three or 



four tablespoonfuls of milk or 
cream; season to your taste with 
pepper, salt and sage. Make this 
into a roll, cover it loosely with a 
well buttered cloth and bake one- 
half hour in a basin with a little 
water in it. When cold cut in thin 
slices. It can be rolled in cracker 
crumbs and baked without a cloth.— 
Mrs. Theo. S. iSegley, Kenneth, Pa. 



ROUND STEAK is very nice thus pre- 
pared: Pound it well, season Avith 
salt and pepper, cover it with bread 
crumljs palatably Masoned, roll up 
and tie closely with J;wine, put in a 
kettle containing a quart of boiling 
water; boil slowly an hour, then put 
it in the dripping pan with the li- 
quor in which it was l)oiled, set it In 
the oven and bake until it is a nice 
brown, basting frequently. Take 
from the pan, thicken the liquor 
with browned flour, pour the gravy 
over the meat and serve. 



TO BROIL MEAT— In broiling meat, 
do not use fat of any kind. Simply 
place the steak on your iron broiler; 
have a good clear fire, either of char- 
coal or the ordinary coal fire, or if 
you use gas, have yoiu" gas lighted 
and the broiler heated; put on the 
steak and as soon as it becomes 
l)rown on one side turn quickly and 
brown on the other. Over a coal lire 
you will need to turn it every twen- 
ty seconds, cooking it from five to 
eight minutes, according to the thick- 
ness of the steak. Dish it at once 
on a heated dish; put over it a little 
butter, pepper and salt and serve. 
Chops are broiled in precisely the 
same manner. 



MUTTON RECHAUFFE— There are 
so many agreeable ways of serving 
mutton a second time that it need not 
l)e eaten cold persistently for econ- 
omonv's sake. 



MUTTON SCALLOP— If the meat is 
tender, cut in thin slices; if not, it 
will be better to chop fine. Season 
palatably with salt and pepper. 
Put a layer in a buttered pan. then 



46 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



one of canned tomatoes, coutiuuing 
until the pan 'is full, tlie top layer be- 
ing of tomatoes. Bake in the oven 
for half an lionr. Serve very hot 
Avith baked potatoes. 



MUTTON PATTIES— Have ready a 
pint of mashed potatoes, add to 
them a cupful of milk and two well 
beaten eg-gs. Butter some small pat- 
ty pans, line them with the potato, 
fil the centers with minced mutton, 
cover with mashed potato and bake 
in the oven for twenty-five minutes. 
Turn out of the pans and serve with 
an onion sauce. 

To prepare the mutton: Remove 
all bones, gristle and fat; reject the 
fat and put bones and gristle in a 
saucepan, cover with water, add a 
spi-ig of parsley, a bay leaf, a clove 
and a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of 
water. Simmer this for the sauce. 
Mince the mutton very tine. One 
cupful will be sufficient for five pat- 
ties, for whicli use a pint of potatoes. 
Add to the mutton a tablespoonful of 
grated onion, a teaspnonful of par- 
sley and a leaf of mint chopped fine 
and season with salt and pepper. 
Moisten with a tablespoonful of hot 
water in wbich a tablespoonful of 
butter has been disolved and use as 
directed. 

For the sauce, strain the water 
from the bones; if any gravy is left, 
add that to the water. Fry three 
tablespoonfuls of chopped onion in 
a tablespoonful of butter, then add a 
tablespoonful of fiour and the water 
strained from the bones. Throw in a 
few sprays of parsley, add half a tea- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg, a tea- 
spoonful of .salt and a small piece of 
a pepper pod and simmer for fifteen 
minutes; strain and serve. 



MUTTON SOUFFLE-:\Iix a cupful 
each of chopped mutton and mnshed 
potatoes, a teaspoonful of salt, half a 
teaspoonful of pai)rika, a teaspoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, a tablespoon- 
ful of grated onion and well beaten 
three yolks of eggs. Fold in the well- 
whipped whites of the eggs and bake 



in small patty pans for lialf an hour. 
They will pufC up and become veiy 
light and delicate. Serve veiy hot. 



MUTTON CECILS— Chop the mutton 
very fine. To one pint add a beaten 
egg. a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, half a 
teaspoonful of pepper, a tablespoon- 
ful of onion juice and two tablespoon- 
fuls of moist bread crumbs with a 
tablespoonful of hot water and let 
them stand a few minutes. Mix the 
whole well together then form into 
small balls, roll in bread crumbs and 
fry to a. rich brown. Serve with to- 
mato or caper sauce. If this dish 
shoiild be desired for breakfast, the 
cecils may be shaped the day before 
and kept in a cool place. If the on- 
ion juice be not liked, it may be omit- 
ted. 

CAPER SAUCE— Mix a tablespoonful 
each of butter and flour until well 
blended. Add slowly a pint of boil- 
ing water and stir. Cook for ten 
minutes. Mix in three tablespoon- 
fuls of capers that have been cut or 
chopped coarsely. Pickled nastur- 
tium pods, which have a fine flavor, 
are prefeiTed by many to capers and 
make a good sauce. The sauce may 
be satisfactorily varied by adding 
two tablespoonfuls of chopped par- 
sley leaves, three tablespoonfxils of 
chopped olives or a rablespoonful of 
chopped fresh mint leaves. 



The mixture of minced mutton in 
the recipe for mutton cecils can be 
used to stuff green peppers, forming 
a vei-y tempting disli. Cut a piece 
from the stem end of the peppers 
and remove the seeds; cover with 
boiling water and let stand for ten 
minutes; drain and fill with the chop- 
ped meat. Place in a baking pan, 
add a cupful of hot water and bake 
in a moderate oven for three-quarters 
of an liour. One pint of chopped 
me'at is sufficient for ten peppers. 
"When the peppers are cooked remove 
them to a dis'h, thicken the water in 
the pan with a tablespoonful of flour 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



47 



and pour around the peppers. If 
there is only one cupful meat, add 
a cupful of stewed tomatoes and a 
cupfiU of rolled oats, rice or hom- 
iny—all of which are, perhaps, "left 
overs" — or a cupful of bread crumbs 
that have been moistened with half 
a cupful of hot milk. 



MUTTON TIMBATvES— Butter a quart- 
.size<l bowl, line it w'ith rice boiled in 
salted water, cool^ed hominy, cooked 
macaroni eliopped small, or rolled 
oats Fill the hollow center with the 
minced meat, cover with a little of 
the cereal used to line the bowl, and 
steam over hot water for thirty min- 
utes. Serve with a cream or tomato 
sauce. 



CURRY OF MUTTON— Cut the mut- 
ton into neat cubes, rejecting all fat. 
Slice two onions in tings and fiy in a 
tablespoonful of butter; when the on- 
ions are brown add pint of water, a 
tablespoonful of curry powder and a 
pint of the cold mutton. Let it come 
to a boil, simmer for ten minutes and 
serve in a border of rice. 



DEVILED MUTTON is a favorite with 
those who enjoy a piquant flavor. 
Cut the mutton into thick slices and 
trim off the fat. If the mutton is 
raw it will be much better than if 
well cooked. Rub a little black pep- 
per into each slice, dip in melted but- 
ter and boil quickly ovei* hot coals. 
Put into a saucejian a cupfiU of 
water, add a tablespoonful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice and the grated rind of a 
lemon. Fry a tablespoonful of onion 
in butter until it is a dark brown; 
add a level tablespoonful of flour 
and the spiced water. Cook for five 
minutes, strain over the boiled mut- 
ton and serve. 

Another metliod is to slice the meat, 
dip it in melted butter, sprinkle 
with salt, pepper and dry mustard, 
roll it in bread crumbs, place on a 
buttered baking pan and brown it 
in a hot oven. Dish on a platter in a 



c'ircle and heap the center with fresh^ 
crisp watei'cresses. 



HOTCH POTCH— Place four pounds 
of the back ribs of mutton in two 
quarts of boiling water. Add two 
turniips cut in squares, a lettuce or 
cabbage and half a cauliflower sbred- 
ded, two carrots cut in squares and 
two grated, two large onions, a 
bunch of parsley and a pint of gi-eeu 
peas. Cook slowly for an hour; thea 
take out the meat, cut it in pieces 
suitable for sening and lay it aside. 
Add another pint of green peas to 
the stew, season with pepper and 
salt and cook for half an hour long- 
er. Then put the meat in the stew 
again, cook for a few minutes and 
turn the wliole into a tureen. Serve 
immediately. Should green peas 
not be in season, dried peas may be 
substituted, but to be tender these 
must be soaked over nigiit and all 
put in the stew at once. 



MUTTON HAGGIS— Boil a sheep's 
liver until tender. When cool, chop 
it fine and mix with it its own weight 
of oatmeal and half its own weight 
finely chopped suet, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt and half a teaspoonful of 
pepper. Mix all together thorough- 
ly, turn into a pudding bag and boil 
for four hours. Allow plenty of 
room for the haggis to swell. Serve 
hot. 



LAMB AND RICE— Half roast a neck 
of lamb; then cut it in steaks. Put 
half a pound of rice in a quart of 
boiling water and cook for ten min- 
utes. Drain and put in a quart of 
gravy from the roast lamb, adding, 
if necessary, liot water to bring the- 
gravy up to tlie required quantity. 
Add half a teaspoonful of mace, cook 
until the rice is well done, stirring 
constantly, add a quarter of a pound 
of butter and the well-beaten yolkis 
of tlu'ee eggs. Lay the slices of lamb 
on a platter, sprinkle witli pepper 
and salt and turn the rice over them. 
Place in the oven for half an lio>u'.

Salads and Salad Dressings, Mayon- 
naise, Etc. 



IF PROrERLY MADE, there is no 
dish tliat is more wholesome or more 
appetizing- than a sahid. Any man 
who has been properly brought up 
can make a good luncheon off of a 
salad, bread and ))utter. tea or choco- 
late. A salad is but little trouble to 
make, if the housewife keeps on 
hand, as she should, a supply of 
salad dressing, and is a good way of 
using up the odds and ends, which 
collect in the best regulated refriger- 
ator. 



SALAD DRESSING-One teaspoonful 
salt, one teaspoonful mustard, one 
tablespoonful butter, tn-o teaspoon- 
fuls sugar, three tables])oonfuls 
cream, yolks of four eggs, one scant 
teacup vinegar: mix and stir over 
tire until it begins to thicken; strain. 
AVhen used, thin with half cup 
cream, whipped. 

When I make this salad dressing 
with the intention of keeping it any 
length of time, I omit the three table- 
spoonfuls of cream in the receipt, 
and add the cream only when I use 
it, usually taking half cup of cream 
to half cup of the dressing. With a 
bottle of this mixture in her refrig- 
erator, the housewife can rest with 
the serene consciousness of being 
alile to prepare a salad in a few mo- 
ments, if desired. I also keep on 
hand a supply of nuts, peanuts or 
English walnuts. Either of these 
are a great addition to a number of 
salads. I prepare these nuts at odd 
times, so as to have them ready 
when the occasion demands. 



BANANA SALAD— Slice bananas, ar- 
range on lettuce leaves, add a few 
nuts and the dressing. 

BANANA AND ORANGE SALAD— 

Slice bananas and oranges, the 
orange very thin, in the proportion of 



one orange to three or four l)ananas; 
arrange on lettuce leaves; add dress- 
ing. 

I'OTATO SALAD-Cut cold boiled po- 
tatoes into small cubes, add peas in 
the proportion of one cupful of peas 
to three of potatoes; add salad dress- 
ing and let stand about two hours be- 
fore serving. 

Cold l)eans or l)eets can be used to 
combine with the potato instead of 
peas or sliced cucumber. Some add 
merely a minced onion to the potato. 
In this last case I would mix in 
either chopped parsley or chopped 
lettuce (not very tine), to give a little 
more color as well as flavor to the 
salad. The addition of beets to the 
potato makes very pretty salad, es- 
pecially if arranged in stripes, the 
pink and the white. 



WALDORF SALAD— One cup apples, 
cut in cubes, one cup celery, half cup 
English walnuts; serve on lettuce 
with salad dressing; garnish witu 
half walnuts. 



FISH SALAD— Mix with minced fish 
an equal quantity of cut celery, 
chopped cab))age or shred lettuce; 
three salt anchovies chopped with a 
dozen capers may be added before 
mixing in thi> divssing. 

All salad looks and tastes better, it 
seems to me, if served on lettuce 
leaves. But if a supply of lettuce is 
not on hand, trim your salad with 
parsley, and the effect will be very 
pretty. 

A little experience will enable the 
housewife to make many new com-

EGG SALAD— Chop two large heads 
of lettuce coarsely Avith eight hard 
boiled eggs, and mix with a small 
cup rich sweet cream, with vinegar,

TOMATO SALAD— Choose uniform 
sized ripe tomatoes, poiu" boiling- 
water over, drain at once, cover with 
cold water, remove the skins and set 
on ice. Make a filling of finely chop- 
ped cucumbers and one-third as 
much chopped green peppers; when 
it is nearly time to serve, cut a slice 
from the stem end, carefully take out 
the seeds, drain out the juice, fill 
half full of the prepared cucumber, 
and till witU whipped cream dress- 
ing- 

A DELICIOUS SALAD is made of 
potatoes, tomatoes and green pep- 
pers; pare and slice the potatoes and 
tomatoes: wash and remove the

THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-COOK. 



SALMON SALAD— Por a pound can 
of salmon, garnished with lettuce, 
make a dressing of one small teacup- 
ful of vinegar, butter half the size 
of an egg, one teasp(5onful of mus- 
tard, one-half teaspoonful pepper, 
one-half teaspoonful salt, one tea- 
spoonful sugar, two eggs. When 
cold, add one-half teacupful cream, 
and pour over the salmon. If ])re- 
ferred, chopped lettuce or celery 
may be added to the salmon. 

TOMATO SALAD— Choose uniform 
size ripe tomatoes, pour boiling water 
over, dra'in at once, cover with cold 
water, remove the skins and set on 
ice. Make a filling of finely chopped 
cucumbers and one-third as much 
chopped green peppers: when ir Is 
nearly time to serve, cut a slice from 
the stem end, carefully take out the 
seeds, drain out the juice, fill half 
full of the prepared cucumber, and 
fill with whipped cream dressing. 



SALAD DRESSING WITHOUT OIL 
—Rub the yolks of three hard boil- 
ed eggs until §mooOi, add half a tea- 
spoonful each of salt and sugar, and 
a saltspoonful each of white pepper 
and mustard, rub well, add three 
tablespoonfuls of rich cream, mix 
thoroughly, then slowly add the vine- 
gar until "the dressing is the consist- 
ency of cream. 



WHIPPED CREAM DRESSING- 
Beat the yolks of two eggs light, add 
one teaspoonful of salt, one salt- 
spoonful of pepper, and two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar; set the bowl on 
teakettle of boiling water, stir 
constantly until it thickens and set 
aside to cool. Whip one-half a cup 
of ei-eam to a stiff froth and gradual- 
ly add the dressing, beating until 
smooth. 

SERVING OF SALAD— Salads at 
dinner usually form a course by 
themselves. A simple salad of some 
green vegetable with French dress- 
ing is preferable always. If there is 



a game course serve the salad with 
it. When lettuce salad with French 
dressing- is served wafers arid cheese 
should, be passed with the salad. 
Where the salad accompanies the 
meat course the wafers and c'heese 
may be sened with the coffee. 



SALADS— A popular way of serving 
salads is to send them to the table in 
pepper cases. Any preferred salad 
maybe so served and gains thereby a 
touch of elegance. Peppers used for 
this purpose should be of uniform 
size. To prepare them, cut a slice 
from the stem end of each, remove 
the seed and let the peppers lie in 
slightly salted water for over an 
hour. When wanted, wipe them dry 
on a soft cloth and fill, letting the 
filling come well above the peppers 
and dotting the top with some thick 
mayonnaise. Different fillings are 
used. Shredded celery, or crisp, 
blanched lettuce mixed with mayon- 
naise or French dressing is good. 
Hard boiled eggs chopped fine Avith 
an equal amount of lettuce, and sea- 
soned to taste, is another favorite 
filling. Lobster cut into cubes, the 
minced white meat of chicken, wal- 
nut meats mixed with lettuce or cel- 
ery, etc.. are all good fillings. 



SALPICON OF FRUIT IN CUPS OF 
ORANGE PEEL— Select very large 
oranges, and cut in half. Remove the 
pulp, whole, if possible, and cut the 
edges of the cup thus formed in 
saw tooth points, then lay in cold 
water to harden. Carefully remove 
all the Avhite, bitter skin and seeds 
from the orange pulp and cut into

matoes, a teaspoontul of salt, half a 
teaspoonful of pepi)er, a large onion 
chopped tine and half a cupful of 
butter. Cook for tive minutes and 
serve hot. 



BROILED TOMATOES are delicious 
as a breakfast dish. Good-sized to- 
matoes should be sliced about three 
times through the greater diameter, 
put in a broiler in which the wires 
are near together, and hold for a few 
minutes over a quick fire. They 
should be put on bits of toast which 
have been buttered and kept warm, 
and each slice of tomato should have 
a bit of butter and a dash of pepper 
and salt. Do not remove the skins 
before broiling, as it makes them too 
soft to handle well. 

BAKED TOMATOES are a hearty 
dish good for a high tea. Chop cold 
meat of any kind— if one has a little 
ham in it, all the better— and toss it 
into a saucepan in which two small 
sliced onions have been fried in a 
tablespoonful of butter. When mix- 
ed together, add half a cupful of 



cracker or dry liread crumbs and stir 
again. Fill the tomatoes, which have 
had the stem spot and inside remov- 
ed, with this mixture and set them 
in a pan and bake for about ten min- 
utes. A bit of initter on the top of 
each tomato just before it is put in 
the oven makes it additionally taste- 
ful. A piece of veal or two or three 
pounds of beef shin, takes on a new- 
air when simmered over a slow fire 
for several hours with a quart of 
skinned tomatoes. A bit of butter 
and salt and pepper to taste when 
they are taken otf the tire give the 
finishing touch to an appetizing dish. 



TOMATOES AND MACARONI -Boil 
one package of macaroni, and when 
Avell cooked, add one can of toma- 
toes (stewed and rulibed through a 
colander), then add l)utter, pepper, 
salt and cook sloAvly for ten min- 
utes. 

TOM A T O OMELETS- Take eight 
eggs, beaten separately, two medium 
sized potatoes, or one very large one, 
chopped fine; add the chopped meats 
to the eggs and pour into the frying 
pan. in which a piece of butter has 
been melted; sprinkle with salt ta 
taste and brown slowly It can then 
be cut in (luarters and turned quick- 
ly to brown, or i)lace in the oven to 
l)rown, the top fold over, and serve 
on a warm platter immediately. 
Garnish with parsley.— Mrs. I. R. 
Beazell, Brownsville. Pa. 

CELERY SAUCE— Slice four heads of 
young celery in small pieces, and boil 
in salt and Avater twenty-four min- 
utes; then drain and put into a clean 
saucepan, covering them Avith white 
or vegetal)le stock; add a teaspoonful 
of salt, a balde of mace and stew al- 
together until tender; mix tAvo 
ounces of butter and a dessertspoon- 
ful of fiour; Avhen this is quite

simmer slowly, adding- more water 
as required till done. Season with 
salt and a cupful of tomato pulp 
cooked till tender. Fill the peppers 
Avith this and serA'e with tomato 
sauce. A pretty way of seining it 
is to put the sauce in a shallow bowl 
and place the bowl in the center of a 
round dish with the stuffed peppers 
surrounding- it. Garnish the edges of 
the dish with a wreath of curled par- 
sley. A nice sauce for the first given 
(rice) filling is made as follows: Yvj 
a minced onion in twice its bulk of 
butter, adding a teasi^oonful or flour 
aud stirring until well lilended. Then 
add slowly a pint of veal gravy, two 
tal)lesiioonfuls of curry powder, a 
mint leaf and a little lemon juice. 
Simmer for ten minutes, strain and 
serve.

of the loaf and fully half an inch 
thick; place in the oven to dry and 
brown slightly. Cut the eggs in half 
lengthwise, separate the yolks from 
the whites and rub the yolks througli 



a ricer or fine sti'ainer; cut the whites 
in eighths lengtliwise and keep in hot 
water until wanted. Make a sauce 
of the butter, flour, milk and season- 
ings and pour hot over the toast; 
sprinkle thickly with the yolks and 
arrange tlie whites as a border, the 
points at one end resting against the 
toast, the others pointing to the 
edge of the plate. 



POACHED EGGS— Drop the eggs 
from the shells one by one into boil- 
ing water. Let them boil until the 
whites harden.

the top scatter a layer of rolled 
crackers and pour two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter over all. Bake 
till finely browned. More cheese 
may be used If desired, but it will be 
at the peril of good digestion. 



MACARONI WITH CHEESE— One- 
quarter pound (or twelve sticks) 
macaroni, broken into one-inch 
lengths and coolvcd in three pints

STUFFED EGGS WITH CHICKEN 
—Have ready some hard boiled eggs; 
reserve two for garnishing and cut 
the i-emainder through the center 
saw-tooth fashion. This gives a 
prettily pointed edge to the cups thus 
formed. Cut a thin slice from the 
bottom of the cups to make them 
stand firm. Rub the yolks through 
a colander, mix with an equal quan- 
tity of finely minced chicken and sea- 
son to taste with salt and pepper, 
and reduce them to a paste with 
melted butter; mould into the shape 
of the original yolks and replace into 
the cups. Prepare some cold chicken 
by cutting into dice and heat it in 
the chicken gravy, to which add 
some milk. The gravy should be as 
thick as ordinaiy cream sauce. Ar- 
range some squares of fresh toast 
on a hot platter, cover with the 
heated mince; on each square place 



one of the prepared eggs and set 
them in the oven for about two min- 
utes to heat the eggs. In the mean- 
time have the two eggs reserved 
ready for garnishing by rubbing the 
wliites and yolks separately through 
line strainer. Sprinkle the yolks 
over the center and the whites 
around the edge, taking care not to 
cover the white cups and their con- 
tents. 



CHINESE EGGS WITH TOMATO 
SAUCE— Six rounds of buttered 
toast, three teaspoonfuls of finely 
chopped parsley, six hard boiled 
eggs, one cupful of tomato sauce. 
Separate carefully the whites and 
yolks of the eggs; cut the whites 
into shreds with a knife or a scis- 
sors and leave the yolks whole. 
Have ready the fresh toast on a hot 
platter and arrange the shredded 
whites on the toast to resemble 
nests; in the center of each nest 
place a yollv and outline faintly with 
a circle of the finely minced parsley. 
Surround with hot tomato sauce and 
serve immediately. The arrange- 
ment of color— red, white, green and 
yellow— makes this a most effective 
dish. 



TOMATO SAUCE— A scant table- 
spoonful each of butter and flour, a 
cupful of strained tomatoes, salt, 
pepper and sugar to season. ]Mix in 
the order given and cook until thick- 
ened. 



STUFFED EGGS— Cut hard boiled 
eggs in halves lengthwise and put 
whites aside in pairs; rub the yolks 
through a colander, season to taste 
with salt, pepper, cayenne, mustard, 
lemon juice or vinegar, and work to 
a smooth paste with melted butter or 
cream. Fill the whites with the mix- 
ture, smooth them and press the two 
corresponding halves together. 



TOMATOES STUFFED WITH EGGS 
—Six tomatoes, six eggs, six rounds 
of toast, one and a half cupfuls of 
cream sauce, toast points and par- 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



17 



sley. Scald and skin tomatoes of 
uniform size: cut a slice from the 
stem end of each and remove enough 
of the pulp to make a receptacle 
large enough to hold an egg. Ar- 
range the tomatoes in a Avell-but- 
tered pan, drop an ^^% into each, 
cover with a tablespoouful of the 
sauce, replace the lid and bake for 
about ten minutes When done, lift 
to rounds of buttered toast, pour the 
remaining sauce around them, gar- 
nish ANith toast points and parsley 
and send vei-v hot to the table. 



CREAM SAUCE— A heaping table- 
spoonful each of butter and flour, 
one and a half cupfuls of milk or 
thin cream, salt and pepper to taste. 
Melt butter, add flour and when 
slightly brown add gradually the 
milk and seasonings. Boil thor- 
oughly. 



TO BEAT EGGS— It should be remem- 
bered "that eggs should be beaten in 
different ways for diffex'ent uses. For 
meringues, sponge-cake, angel-food, 
or any other use in which the cells 
are to be coarse, a wire beater that 
beats the air in is the proper one to 
use. For other cakes and compounds 
requiring finer grain, the wheel egg 
beater is better. Similarly, to whip 
cream for chocolate russe or syla- 
bubs the former is preferable, while 
that which is served with chocolate 
or coffee, or used as a sauce for jel- 
lies, may be more solid and is pro- 
duced best by the wheel beater. 



CHEESE FONDU— One-half pound 
cheese, two cups bread cinimbs, one 
pint milk, three eggs, a small lump

ft FEW RECIPES FOR TttE CttflFFlNG- 
DlStl. 

WELSH RAREBIT— One-half pound 
grated cheese, tablespoonfu] of but- 
ter, two eggs, and one-half cup 
cream. Add salt and a thought of 
cayenne pepper. Melt cheese first, add 
butter and eggs, beaten lightly; add 
cream gradually, and cook till it 
thickens. Spread on crackers and 
serve.— Miss Mary Thompson. 



OYSTERS A LA NEWBURG— Heat 
one gill of cream in a double boiler. 
Rub one large tablespoonful flour in- 
to two ounces of butter. Rub the 
yolks of three hard boiled eggs 
>smooth with a little cream; add to 
hot cream with flour mixture; stir 
luitil thick and smooth: add a shake 
of red pepper and one-half teaspoon- 
ful salt. Cook forty oysters in their 
own liquor and one teaspoouful of 
salt until edges are curled, about ten 
minutes, then drain; add at once to 
cream prepared with two tablespoon- 
fuls sheri-y and serve at once. 



LOBSTER A LA NEWBERG— Two 
pounds lobster, boiled forty-five min- 
utes, yolks three hard l>oiled eggs, 
rubbed smooth with cream or milk, 



78 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



one large tablespoonful of flour 
rubbed into two tablespoonfuls but- 
ter. Heat one gill of cream in a 
double boiler, add the prepared yolks 
and flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, 
a shake of red pepper and one grat- 
ing of nutmeg. Cook and stir until 
smooth and thick, then add lobster 
meat and cook ten minutes long-er. 
Just before serving add two table- 
sponfuls sherry or ^Maderia wine. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS— One quart 
oysters. Put in colander, drain off 
the juice and wash carefully to re- 
move all bits of shell. Butter a deep 
pudding dish, cover the bottom with 
cracker crumbs (not too fine), season 
with salt, pepper and bits of butter, 
then a layer of oysters, seasoned; a 
layer of crackers, then oysters, until 
the oysters are used. Put cracker 
crumbs on top with bits of butter; 
pour over a few tal)lespoonfuls of the 
oyster liquor, strained, and one cup 
cream. Bake covered 'half an hour, 
uncovered half an hour. 



SOUTHERN GOLDEN BUCK— Break 
tine and melt down in the chating- 
dish half a pound of good cheese- 
any kind will do if not too old. When 
perfectly soft add a cupful of cream 
and a pinch of red pepper. Stir these 
thoroughly together until they are of 
tlie consistency of thick cream. 
When blended break on top of them 
five eggs. Cover the dish for a mo- 
ment or two; when the eggs have be- 
gun to "set" and before they become 
hard remove the cover and Vith a 
large spoon beat the mixture briskly 
for a few moments. It will rise in a 
foamy mass, tender and delicious, 
and should be served on pieces of 
hot buttered toast, or better yet. 
milk crackers buttered and then heat- 
ed in the oven. This dish is inexpen- 
sive, nutritious and perfectly digest- 
tible. not having the ropy character- 
istics of so many cheese dishes. 



FISH A LA MANILA— Take about 
a pound and one-half of any cold 
boiled fish. Let it stand in a mixture 
composed of a tablespoonful each of 



oil and vinegar, a slice of chopped on- 
ion and pepper and salt to laste. 
Pour off such liquor as is not .-ibsorb- 
ed. Keep the fish in as large pieces 
as possible. Put in a chafing dish 
three tablespoonfuls each of cooking 
s'heriy, tomato catsup and butter, and 
stir together until well blended. Then 
put in the fish and baste with this 
sauce until it is hot. A few chopped 
pickles tossed in just before serving 
are agreeable. Wooden spoons are 
desirable in working with a chafing- 
dish; they are sold in all sizes, are 
clean and make no noise and do not 
become heated in the handle. A set 
of Chinese or Russian wooden bowls 
are pretty and useful for mixing and 
preparing the food. 



FUDGE IN A CHAFING-DISH— Put 
into your chafing-dis'h two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one cupful of 
dark brown sugar, half a cupful of 
milk, two cuiifuls of New Orleans 
molasses, and four squares (or 
ounces) of chocolate grated. Light 
the lamp and stir the mixture con- 
stantly until it will form a rather 
hard ball when dropped into ice 
Avater. Put out the light; and, if 
yon like, add a teaspoonful of vanilla, 
and then allow the mixture to cool. 



WELSH RAREBIT-One-half pint 
milk, one-half pint water, one tea- 
spoonful of flour, sialt and pepper; 
mix the flour with a little water and 
stir into the milk and water when it 
comes to a boil; then stir in one well 
beaten egg. Gi-ate a scant quarter of 
a pound of rich cheese and stir into 
the other. Seiwe on well buttered 
toast.— M. M. E. 



RAREBIT— Take one cup of cheese 
and one pint of milk, heat boiling 
water; add cheese and set it back 
so it will not boil, when cheese is 
melted, add the beaten yolks of four 
eggs, one tablespoonful of buttei', 
salt to taste. Have toasted soda 
crackers or slices of toast, buttered; 
spread tliem land serve veiy hot. 
This makes excellent 'sandwiches. — 
Mrs. N. B. S.

YEAST— A .small handful of hops, tie 
ill a thill bag; let three pints of water 
come to a boil, then put in the bag, 
boil five minutes; take out bag and 
put in one cup white sugar, one 
tablespoonful of salt, one quart of 
grated raw potato. Let all boil fif- 
teen minutes. After it is done, set 
aAA-ay until it is lukewarm; then put 
in yeast. After yeast is made, set in 
a warm place to raise two days, then 
tie up and put away ready for use. 



YEAST— One dozen large potatoes, 
one pint hops tied in a cloth and 
boiled with the potatoes; mash the 
potatoes and put about three quarts 
of the liquid the potatoes and hops 
are boiled in in; when cool, add one 
cup sugar, one cup of salt and one 
cup of yeast. To start let it stand in 
a warm place for twenty-four hours, 
then seal. It is ready for use.— Sarah 
Edmundson. 



BREAD— Two cups warm milk, half 
tablespoonful of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls salt, one teaspoonful or 
more of sugar, one-half cake yeast, 
flour. Heat the milk or water, melt 
the butter in it, add the salt. While 
the milk is cooling, dissolve the yeast 
in half cupful luke warm water; add 
it and the hour gradually; mix with 
a knife or spoon. "NVlieii stiff enough 
to handle, turn the dough out on a 
floured board, knead it until soft and 
elastic: put back in bowl, cover tight- 
ly, and let rise in a warm place until 
double its bulk; then divide into 
loaves or shape into liiscuit. Allow 
these to rise in the pan in which they 
are to be baked. Cover and again 
allow it to double its bulk. Bake 
loaves about one hour in hot oven, 
r.iscuit reciuire more heat than 
loaves of bread.— Mrs. Rev. Miller, 
Duquesne, Pa. 



PLAIN AND DELICIOUS BREAD— 
One cake of yeast, one tablespoonful 



salt, four and one-half pints of water. 
Put the water and salt in the crock 
the night before baking and quickly, 
"but gently, stir in enough spring 
Avheat flour to make a batter stiff 
enougli to drop from spoon. Then add 
■the yeas't dissolved in a little of the 
water, cover closely and let rise. In 
the morning take a pan of flour, 
the flour rarown up around the sides, 
leaving a space in the middle. In- 
to this space pour the sponge, which 
should be up to the top of the crock 
by this time. Knead in the flour un- 
til it ceases to be sticky, remembering 
a little too much flour will do no 
great damage, but not enough makes 
wet, soggy bread. Knead only long 
enough to get in the dry flour, and 
tliat ligihtly. Retvirn to crock and let 
rise, usually from one hour to one and 
one-fourth hours. When light, loosen 
the bread from the sides of the crock 
with a knife and turn out on a board 
without flour. Gently press the light- 
ness out, folding over the bread and 
drawing it from you. and on no ac- 
count pound or press holes in it. Put 
the bread back in the crock and let 
stand until light again; then loosen 
with knife and tuni out on board 
without spoiling lightness and with 
a knife cut into four equal parts, or 
more, if small loaves are desired. 
Quickly and gently mould each por- 
tion iiito' a loiaf and place in a well 
greased pan. Let rise until very 
light and iJake in a moderate oven 
for fifty minutes. Tlie loaves will 
peem light in tJie hand when done. 
If carefully carried out, you will 
have snow-white, light, flaky bread 
Avith all the sweet flavor of the 
wheat. Remember it is the number 
of times it rises makes the fine, flaky 
bread and not the kneading. Use luke 
warm water and warm flour in cold 
weather. Keep an even temperature 
all through. — Mrs. W. A. Applegate. 



BREAD— Boil three or four medium 



82 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



sized potatoes in a quart of water; 
when well done, take out and mash, 
after which add the boiling water; 
add enough cold water to make luke- 
warm; pour in a coffee cup of home- 
made yeast; stir in flour enough to 
make a thick, heavy sponge, prepar- 
ing this in the evening; in tlie morn- 
ing put flour in pan, add a little salt 
and pour nearly a (piart of boiling 
water, or milk, in the middle of flour, 
stirring well all the flour the water 
will take; cool this slightly liy pour- 
ing two or three tablespoonfuls of 
cold water in, then pour on sponge 
and knead until smooth; set to rise 
until very light in the pan; mould 
out in bread pans and set to rise 
again; bake for one hour. This 
makes five loaves and will keep until 
used. — Mrs. Leticia Momver. 



SELECTION OF FLOUR— Good bread 
flour is rather coarse, granulated and 
creamy yellow, dry, and cannot 
easily be packed on pressure. 



WHITE BREAD— The ordinary meth- 
ods of milling remove the necessity 
of making sponge for white bread, 
especially where compressed yeast is 
used. Bread is no longer made at 
night if it can possil)ly be made in 
the morning. Shortening and pota- 
toes ai'e not used in these progressive 
days. Patent flour, the sort we now 
use, requires a great deal more mois- 
ture than the old-fashioned flours; 
consequently it must be kneaded 
soft, not made dry and hard. There 
is no comparison between this and 
the old-fashioned flours. The new 
flours are better in e-\'ery way. The 
best bread is made in France. 
Water, yeast, salt and flour only are 
used. To make white bread, scald 
a pint of milk; add a pint of water, 
and Avhen lukewarm add a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and one compressed yeast 
cake, dissolved in two tablespoonfuls 
of warm water. Now begin to add 
flour, beating constantly until you 
have a dough. Turn it out on a 
board and knead it until it is soft 
and spongy. Put it back into the 
bowl, cover and stand in a warm 



place for three hours. Then when 
very light, form carefully into 
loaves. Put them into greased pans» 
cover, let stand initil light. Brush 
with water, pick carefully on top and 
bake in a moderately quick oven for 
three-quarters of an hour. Allow 
this bread to cool without wrapping. 



KNE.vDING BREAD— It is a curious 
fact that kneading l)oards are seldom 
washed clean after using. This is a 
menace to health. A glass moulding 
plate and a glass rolling-pin are best 
for several reasons; they are not 
sticky and are sure to be washed af- 
ter using. Marble slabs are provided 
in some kitchens, with glass rolling- 
pins. 



RYE BREAD— It is much easier in 
these days of patented rye flour to 
make a good light rye bread than it 
was in the days of our grandmoth- 
ers. If you like, you may make a 
sponge of ordinary white flour and 
then thicken it with rye. Scald a 
pint of milk, add to it a pint of 
water; Avhen lukewarm add one com- 
pressed yeast cake dissolved. Stir in 
sufficient white flour to make a bat- 
ter that will drop fi'ora a spoon; beat 
continuously for Ave minutes; cover 
and stand in a warm place (about 75 
degrees Fahrenheit) for three hours. 
Then, stir in sufficient rye flour to 
make a soft dough; knead until elas- 
tic, remembering that rye flour is al- 
ways more or less sticky as com- 
pared with wheat, so that you can- 
not knead it until it is dry. When it 
arrives at the stage of easy handling- 
put it at once into the pans. When 
very light (say about one hour after), 
bake in a moderate oven for forty- 
five minutes in single or long pans. 
If you bake more than one loaf in a 
pan, which is always objectionable, 
the loaves must be baked for one 
hour. 



GOOD ROLLS— For excellent rolls try 
the following: Two quarts of sifted 
flour, warmed, one-half cup of butter 
well rubbed into the flour, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one pint of milk. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK.

ing board and knead twenty min- 
utes, or until it will not cling to 
bcwird. Set to rise for three hours, 
knead thoroughly, put in pans and 
let rise one hour. Bake forty-five 
minutes. This Avill make three loaves 
and is intended for morning bread- 
making. Do not cover bread when 
removed from oven. 

BROWN BREAD No. 1.— Two cup- 
fuls of sAveet milk, one-half cupful

of graham flour, one cupful Avhite 
flour, two teaspoonfuls baking poAv- 
der. Sift both kinds of flour and 
baking poAvder together five times, 
throAviug away the bran after each 
sifting. Be sure you have three cup- 
fuls after sifting five times. Mix all 
together, stirring as little as pos- 
sible, to get it smooth. The batter 
A\-ill be quite thin. Pour into but-

or for several houi-s. When vei-y 
light pinch off little bits, form into 
buns, stand them in a baliing pan 
where they cannot touch each other, 
and when veiy light put them into a 
quiclv oven for fifteen minutes. Af- 
ter they have been in the oven for 
ten minutes brush with a mixture of 
Avhite of egg and sugar and milli 
beaten together. Put them back un- 
til they are of a golden-brown color. 



RUSK— Two cups of sugar, one of but- 
ter, two eggs, one pint of sweet milk, 
three pints of flour, one cup of yeast; 
put all these ingredients together in 
the evening; in the morning make 
stiff, let rise and bake. 



BREAKFAST OAKE— The following 
ingredients are required for Wash- 
ington breakfast cake: one egg thor- 
oughly beaten, butter the size of an 
egg, a small cupful of sweet milk, 
a half cupful of liquid yeast, and 
sufficient flour to form a stiff mix- 
ture. The mixture should be put to 
rise over night in the buttered tin in 
which it is to be baked, and baked 
for eighteen or twenty minutes in a 
hot oven, allowing just enough time 
to serve hot for breakfast. 



CURRANT LOAF-Rub a quarter of a 
pound of butter into one quart of 
flour, then mix in half a cupful of 
sugar. Dissolve one j^east cake in 
two tablespoonfuls of warm water. 
Scald and cool one pint of milk, add 
the yeast tx) the milk then stir 
both into the flour and stand 
aside in a warm place for two hours. 
Tliis mixture should form a batter, 
not a dough. If your flour is very 
strong you may possibly have to add 
half a cupful of extra milk. At the 
end of two hours add three eggs 
Avell beaten and a cupful of floured 
currants. Mix and turn into a 
greased round cake pan. Cover and 
stand aside again for two hours, and 
bake in a moderate oven for three- 
quarters of an hour. 



^OLAR— Make a good rich bread 
dough; let it rise over night. In the 



morning mix with it two eggs and 
half a pound of butter; knead well 
and place near fire until thoroughly 
risen. Roll out into thin sheet and 
sprinkle with chopped almonds, cit- 
ron, cinnamon, plenty of brown sugar 
and lumps of "butter. Roll up like 
jelly-roll and cut in pieces a finger 
long. Grease pans, stand one piece 
in center and others around it, and 
let rise before baking. Watch well 
during time in the oven. Use plenty 
of fruit, and the darkest sugar you 
can procure. 



RAISED LOAF CAKE— Put one pint 
of bread dough, after it has been well 
kneaded, into a bowl. Cover and 
stand in a warm place for one hour 
or one hour and a half. Then add 
one cupful of granulated sugar, half 
a cupful of butter and four eggs, 
well beaten. Beat carefully and 
thoroughly for at least twenty min- 
miuutes, until all strings disappear. 
Then add, if you like, a teaspoonful 
of ciunamon and one cupful of c'eed- 
ed raisins well floured, or a cupful of 
currants well floured. 



GEMS— One egg beaten very light; add 
one pint milk or water, a pinch of 
salt and flour enough to make a thick 
batter, and add one teaspoonful of 
baking powder, beating it in light- 
ly. Have gem pans greased, but not 
hot, drop in batter and bake in hot 
oven twenty minutes. They can be 
made with corn meal, graham flour 
or whole wheat flour and will be 
equally as good. 



CURRANT LOAF-On baking day 
take from your dough Avhen ready 
for Ijaking, two cups of sponge, add 
two cups of white sugar, one cup of 
l)utter, three eggs, two tablespoon- 
fuls of sweet cream, one-half pound 
of currants, dredged, and one and 
one-half teaspoonfuls of cinnamon: 
stiffen and let rise well. This makes 
three loaves. 



RYE DROP OAKES— Two cups rye 
meal, one cup Indian meal, one-half 
cup flour, one egg, one-half teaspoon- 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



fill soda, salt, three large spoonfuls 
of molasses. Dissolve the soda in a 
little boiling water; mix all with 
water or milk; put eggs, well beaten, 
in last. Drop in deep boiling fat 
from a tablespoon and fry like 
doughnuts.— Mrs. A. M. Saunders. 

CRULLERS— One cup sour cream, 
one-half cup sugar, one cup of flour, 
one egg; cut the dough with a small 
diamond shaped cutter, and fry in 
boiling lard; when done, roll in pow- 
dered sugar. 

WAFFLES— Take one quart of flour, 
two teaspoonfuls of melted butter, 
two teaspoonfuls of salt and sweet 
milk sufficient to make a thick bat- 
ter; mix thoroughly; add one egg, 
well beaten, and one measure of bak- 
ing powder; stir well and bake im- 
mediately in waffle irons. 



CORN MUFFINS— Take one cup of 
corn meal, one cup of milk, one-half 
cup of flour, one tablespoonful of 
butter, and one of sugar; salt to suit 
taste, then add one-half teaspoonful 
of baking powder. 



BUTTERMILK BISCUIT— One-third 
cup sugar; dissolve one teaspoonful 
soda (level) in two cups cold butter- 
milk; sift two heaping teaspoonfuls 
cream of tartar in two quarts flour, 
stir in one-half cup soft lard (not 
melted). After sifting into the flour 
and cream tartar one rounded tea- 
spoonful soda (making two sittings 
for the flour), stir in the liquid (but- 
termilk with soda), then dissolve 
one-fourth teaspoonful soda in one 
cup sour cream; add quickly, roll 
one-half inch thick, cut in small bis- 
cuit and bake in quick oven. These 
are unusually light and healthful. 



GRAHAMS— Two cups of buttermilk, 
one-half rounded teaspoonful soda, 
one-half teaspoonful salt, equal parts 
graham and white flour. Bake in 
gem pans in quick oven. 

GRAHAMS No. 2— One egg, one and 
one-half cups buttermilk, one-half 



cup thick cream, tablespoonful mo- 
lasses, one rounding teaspoonful 
soda, one part Avhite flour, one part 
graham, enough to make thin batter. 
Hot oven. One teaspoonful sugar in 
each of the foregoing gives a delicate 
brown and improves flavor. 



IRISH POTATO CAKES— Boil care- 
fully four good-sized potatoes; when 
done, drain dry and mash; add half a 
cupful of hot milk, a tablespoonful 
of butter, a level teaspoonful of salt, 
a dash of pepper and beat until the 
mixture is light and smooth; stir in 
not more than half a cupful of sifted 
flour. Make into small ^akes; bake 
in muffin rings on a griddle, or they 
may be baked in gem pans. 



BREAKFAST CAKE— The folloAving 
ingredients are required for AVash- 
ington breakfast cake: One egg, 
thoroughly beaten, butter the size of 
an egg, a small cupful of sweet milk, 
a half cupful of liquid yeast, and 
sufficient flour to form a stiff mix- 
ture. The mixture should be put to 
rise over night in the buttered tin in 
which it is to be baked, and baked 
for eighteen or twenty minutes in a 
hot oven, allowing just enough time 
to serve hot for breakfast. 



PANCAKES— Into a quart of sour 
miilk or buttermilk stir in enough 
flour to make a thick batter. Let it 
stand over night. In the morning add 
salt to taste, two well beaten eggs, 
and half a teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in a little warm water. 



POTATO BISCUIT— One cup yeast, 
one cup warm water, one cup sugar, 
one cup butter, two cups of mashed 
potatoes, four eggs and a little nut- 
meg. Put to rise in the morning 
about nine o'clock, put in butter and 
eggs at noon. Knead it, then let it 
rise same as bread. Make into small 
biscuit and let rise again. Bake in a 
quick oven. Half of this will make 
forty or fifty biscuits; of course you 
take flour enough to make the right 
consistency. Miss Hoggs' recipe.— 
Mrs. M. G. Rrrabo.

CORN BATTER CAKES— Mix two 
parts t)utteniiillv Tvith one of sAveet 
milk; one egg, one liautlful of wheat 
flour, a litfle salt, one teaspoonful of 
soda, and as much corn meal as is 
needed to malie a batter.— Mrs. A. W. 
Donahey, Duquesne, Pa. 



WAFFLES— One quart milk, butter 
size of an egg, one large table- 
spoonful sugar; make this warm 
enough to melt the butter. Thor- 
oughly beat four eggs, mix eggs and 
milk together. Now add one-half 
^•teaspoonful salt; dissolve two cakes 
• compressed yeast in two tablespoon- 
fuls cold water. Add enough flour to 
make a thin batter; add yeast, beat 
up well, and allow to rise for three 
hours. Bake in waffle irons. — Mrs. 
Geo. Jacobs. 



BISCUITS— One quart of flour, one 
tablespoonful of lard, one of butter, 
not much heaped, three teaspoonfuls 
l)aking powder, and one of salt; rub 
these together lightly with the fin- 
gers vmtil thoroughly' mixed: then 
add two-thirds of a pint of milk and 
mix with a knife, turn out on a 
floured board and roll with as little 
AA'orking as possible; cut with a small 
glass, or cutter, and Ijake In a hot 
oven. — A. M. 



GRAHAM BISCUIT— Take one quart 
of graham floin-, one measure of bak- 
ing powder and one teaspoonful of 
salt; mix thoroughly, then add two- 
thirds of a pint of cold sweet milk; 
this makes a dough too soft to be 
rolled; turn it out on your tray-lid, 
well floured, press with yoiu* hand to 
the desired tliickness, cut in shapes 
and bake at once in a very quick 
oven. If the oven is at a proper 
heat, ten minutes will suffice to bake 
them. 



SPANISH XOAST— Take stale bread, 
cut in thick ])ieces, and dip in egg 
with milk in-epared like custard, but 
without sweetening or flavoring. 
When the slices are well satvu-ated, 
fry in a very little butter— enough to 
prevent adhering to the pan. 



GRIDDLE CAKES— Any cold, cooked 
rice can be used in making i-ice grid- 
dle cakes. Soften and break it up 
with a little milk, and to each cupful 
add a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
the yolk of an egg, salt, if necessary, 
sufficient flour to nialce a Ijatter, a 
level teaspoonful of baking powder, 
and, lastly, the stiffly beaten white 
of an egg. Cook as other griddle 
cakes. 



BREAD CAKES— To make the bread 
cakes, scald a cupful of bread 
cruml^s (not dried) with a cupful of 
boiling milk, add a large teasiioonful 
of butter and let soalc over night or 
until the crumbs are well softened; 
then add an egg— the yolk and white 
beaten separately— a fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a cupful of 
flour, a teaspoonful of baking pow- 
der and cold milk if necessary to thin 
the batter. Bake as other griddle 
cakes. 



CORN FRITTERS— One pint grated 
corn, one-half teacupful of milk, one- 
half teacupful of flour, one small tea- 
spoonful baking powder, one table- 
spoonful melted butter, two eggs, 
one teaspoonful salt, a little pepper. 
Fry in hot lard. 



APPLE FRITTER >•>— Make a batter, 
not very stilf, with one quart of milk, 
three eggs and flour to bring it to 
light consistency. Pare and core half 
a dozen large apples, and chop them 
to about the size of small peas and 
mix them well in the batter. Fry 
them in lard as you would dougli- 
nuts. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. 



FARINA FRITTERS (Excellent)— Boil 
two quarts of milk, at the same time 
add one pound of farina; this must 
be stirreu as in making corn meal 
mush. AVhen cooked, add two eggs, 
well beaten with one-half cup of 
sugar; put into a dish or pan one 
inch deep. When cold, cut in pieces 
three inches long liy one inch wide, 
roll in cracker dust and fry; sprinkle 
well with powdered sugar when

ready for the table.— Baruum's Ho- 
tel, Baltimore. 



GRAHAM GEMS— One and a half cups 
sweet milk, one-half cup white flour, 
one-half cup corn meal, one and a 
half cups graham flour, three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, two tablespoon- 
fuls of lard, one teaspoonful of soda, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt.— Mrs. R. 
P. Miller, Homestead, Pa. 



BERRY TEA CAKES— Nice little tea 
cakes, to be baked in muffin rings, 
are made of one cup sugar, two eggs, 
one and one-half cups of milk, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking pow- 
der, a piece of butter the size of an 
egg, and flour sufficient to make a 
stiff batter. In this batter stir a pint 
of fruit (any fresh fruit is nice), or 
canned 'berries with the juice poured 
off. Serve while warm. They are a 
dainty addition to the tea table. 
Eaten with butter.— Miss Frances 
Bowen, Duquesne, Pa. 



GERMAN POTATO PANCAKES— 
Pare and grate eight good sized po- 
tatoes, add one tablespoonful of flour, 
one egg, one teaspoonful salt. Mix 
well. Bake like pancakes, but use 
more grease.— Mrs. August Miller, 
Homestead. 



ROLLED OATS CAKES— Two-thirds 
cup melted lard, tr^-o cups brown 
sugar, one scant teaspoonful soda in 
two-thirds of a cup of boiling water, 
three cups of rolled oats, three cups 
of flour.— Mrs. Mattie Fouche. 



CORN MUFFINS— One tablespoonful 
of butter, one-half cup 'sugar, one egg, 
one cup sweet milk; sieA'e togetlier 
the following: one cup flour, one cup 
commeal, one teaspoonful of soda, 
two tea spoonfuls of cream of tartar. 
Bake in gem pans.— Mrs. J. B. 
Stewart. 



SPIDER CORN CAKE— One and two- 
third cups of corn meal, one-third 
cup of flour, two eggs, two cups 
of sweet milk, one cup of sour 



milk, one-fourth cup of sugar, one 
scant teaspoonful of soda, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, a piece of butter, 
half the size of an egg. Dissolve the 
soda in one cup of sweet milk and 
add to the dry ingredients; also, add 
the sour milk, then the eggs, which 
should be beaten light. Have a 
large frying pan very hot, put into 
it the butter, well greasing the sides 
of the frying pan, and then pour in 
the mixture. After it is all in take 
the second cup of milk and pour it 
round and round the mixture, not 
stirring it. Set the frying pan in 
the oven and bake for twenty-five 
minutes.— Mrs. T. D. Gardner. 



CORN BREAD— T^vo even pints of 
corn meal, three pints (flowing over 
the edge of cup) of boiled water, 
lard the size of an egg, one cup of 
sweet milk, flowing over the edge of 
cup. three eggs, beaten as light as for 
cake, foiu- even teaspoonfuls of salt. 
This will make four pans. How to 
mix: Put the meal in the pan with 
the salt and lard, pour in the boiling 
water, stir Avell to avoid being 
lumpy; when well mixed put in the 
sour milk, then stir in the eggs; 
grease and have hot four pie pans, 
fill, and bake in hot oven fifteen min- 
utes. — Mrs. Joseph Serena. 



PANCAKES— There are few greater 
culinary blunders than to waste eggs 
on wheat cakes. The batter in 
which eggs are used is much tougher 
aud decidedly inferior to one made 
without eggs. Take equal quantities 
of flour and milk, using an even tea- 
spoonful of baking powder to ever.^- 
cupful of flour, and a scant half cup- 
ful of butter to every two cupfuls: 
fried out beef fat aud butter in 
equal parts will take the place of 
butter in this case. About half a 
teaspoonful of salt must be used to 
every cupful of beef fat. Indian 
meal pancakes require the use of an 
egg for every cupful of meal, and at 
least half a cupful of wheat flour. 
Use a quarter of a cupful of "short- 
ening" to every two of the mixture 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



91 



of flour and Indian meal, and a tea- 
spoonful of baking powder to every 
cupful. 



FLANNEL CAKE WITHOUT EGGS 
— One cup of sour cream or butter- 
milk, one good teaspoonful of soda, 
salt to taste, and floiu" enough to 
make the consistency of ordinary 
griddle cakes; beat long and well, as 
more than one-half depends on the 
beating; bake on a hot griddle. 



FRITTERS— To one pint of buttermilk 
add a little salt, one teaspoonful of- 
soda, and stir in flour enough to 
make a stiff batter. Fi-y in hot lard. 
One or two eggs improves them. 



CORN FRITTERS— Mix in three pints 
of corn meal one and a half meas- 
ures of baking powder, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour (wheat), three tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, one egg, beaten; 
add one quart of sweet milk, or a 
pint each of milk and water; drop in 
hot grease and fry. 



APPLE FRITTERS— Make a batter 
with one cup of sweet milk, one tea- 
spoonful sugar, two eggs, whites and 
yolks beaten separately, two cups 
flour, one teaspoonful baking pow- 
der mixed with flour. Chop some 
good tart apples, mix in the butter, 
and fry in hot lard. Serve with 
maple syrup. 



RICE FRITTERS— Take one teacvip- 
ful of rice, cook well; after it has be- 
come cool, add three eggs, beaten, 
one pint of sweet milk, one table- 
spoonful of salt, one quart of wheat 
flour and one measure of baking 
powder; first mixing the powder 
with the dry flour and passing both 



through a sieve; drop in hot grease 
and fry. 

OYSTER FRITTERS— Chop one pint 
of oysters; take one pint of milk, a 
litle salt and pepper, one small tea- 
spoonful baking powder, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Stir 
in the oysters, drop from the spoon 
in hot lard, or butter, or fry a deli- 
cate brown. 



PINEAPPLE FRITTERS— Make a 
batter with half a pint of milk, two 
eggs and sufficient flour to make it 
the consistency of thick cream; cut 
off as many thin slices of pineapple 
as 3'ou require and dip them into the 
batter. With a large spoon take up 
a slice of the pineapple, Avith enough 
batter to cover it. Drop this into a 
frying pan of boiling lard; when 
nicely crisp, take up and place on 
kitchen paper. When drained from 
all fat, pile on a hot dish and sift a 
little crushed sugar over the fritters. 



CORN FRITTERS— Before grating 
the corn from the cob, in making 
corn fritters, run the point of a sharp 
knife the length of the cob through 
every row of kernels. Then grate 
the tops from the kernels and press 
out the pulp remaining on the cob 
with the back of the knife. To two 
cupfuls of corn add the Avell-beaten 
yolks of two eggs, one cupful of 
milk, one cupful of flour, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt and one salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Beat the mix- 
ture tlKU-oughly; then stir in the 
stifflv beaten whites of the eggs and 
one teaspoonful of baking powder. 
Fry by spoonful on griddle or in 
deep fat. 



Corn Oysters 
To one cupful of finely-chopped canned 
corn add one egg slightly beaten, four table- 
spoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of 
sugar, salt and pepper to taste. Drop the 
size of an oyster into a hot well-greased 
blazer. Brown on one side, then turn, as 
giiddle-cakes, and brown on other side. Serve

CAKE— Put one cup of granulated 
sugar and a quarter of a cup of water 
over the fire together. Sth- until the 
sugar is dissolved, then boil careful- 
ly until it forms a soft ball when 
dropped into cold water. While 
watching this pull apart half pound 
of niarshmallows, put them in a 
double boiler with two tablespoon-

WALNUT FILLING— Chop fine a cup 
of English walnut meats— the un- 
shelled walnuts are preferable for 
this pui-pose, for the kernels are not 
so dry— and add these to boiled icing. 
Ice the top of the cake and neatly ar- 
range a row of whole walnut meats 
around the edge, or dust it over with 
powdered sugar. 



BOILED ICING— Put a cup of sugar 
into a saucepan with one-quarter of a 
cup of water. Let these boil, without 
stirring, until when a fork is dipped 
into the mixture and held up the 
syrup spins a fine thread. Have the 
white of an egg beaten to a stiff 
froth in a quart bowl; slowly pour 
the syrup into this, stirring vigorous- 
ly all the time to the very l)ottom of 
the bowl. Then beat the mixture un- 
til it is cold. 



MAPLE SUGAR ICING— Put a heap- 
ing cup of pure maple sugar broiceu 
into small pieces into a saucepan v/ith 
just enough boiling water to mois- 
ten them. Set them on the stove 
where the syrup will boil rapidly — but 
not burn— for fifteen or twenty min- 
utes. Have ready in a bowl the 



white of an egg beaten to a stiff 
froth. Pour syrup slowly into this, 
stirring hard. Then beat the mixture 
until stiff' and cold. Beat up the yolk 
of the egg with a tea spoonful of 
milk and thin the filling with this, 
using as much of it as is necessary. 
When the cake is cold, spread the 
filling between the layers. 



CURRANT JELLY AND WALNUT 
FILLING — To a cup of home-made 
currant jelly, add a cup of finely 
chopped English walnuts. If this 
be too tart to suit the taste, a table- 
vSpoonful or two of boiled icing may 
be put with the mixture. Almonds, 
blanched and chopped fine, may be 
substituted for the walnuts. These 
fillings look well with the yellow 
layers. 



RAISIN FILLING— For the boiled ic- 
ing use one white, if the egg is large, 
to one cup of sugar; two whites if the 
eggs are small, to two scant cups of 
sugai'. Wash and dry a cup of seed- 
ed raisins, chop these a little and 
stir them into the boiled icing, thin- 
ning it with a little milk if it be too 
thick to spread easily. 



A FRUIT FILLING— Mix the follow- 
ing ingredients with a sufficient 
quantity of boiled icing and spread 
between the layers of the dark layer 
cake: Four tablespoonfuls of citron 
chopped very fine; four tablespoon- 
fuls of finely chopped seeded raisins; 
half a cup of almonds that have been 
blanched and chopped fine, or of

Cookeru and Cooking Utensils. 

Two widely diverging subjects, cookery and dry goods, but as this store 
prides itself in having everything the public wants, or rather demands, the 
finest cooking utensils are to be found here as well as the finest things in the 
dry goods line. 

The House-Furnishing Department. 

If you have never been in our basement where there are several stores, 
you have no idea what a complete house-furnishing department means. This 
department occupies a large section of the basement, and is filled with the 
best kitchen utensils made both in this country and from foreign manufac- 
turers. 

Much of the high class ware is exclusive with us — notably the foreign 
ware. Take as an instance the Stransky Steel Ware which we import direct 
from the maker in Germany. 

The dilTerent utensils of this line, which comprises everything from a cup 
to a large stock-pot, are made of steel over which are four coats of enamel, 
white interior and brown exterior. 

Each piece is guaranteed 5 years. It costs a tritle more than ordinary 
kitchen ware, but the ditTerence is easily made up in the length of service. If 
you use Stransky once you will never use any other. 

Then we carry full lines of all the good agate wares and granite wares be- 
sides everything in papier mache ai tides. 

A special feature of this house-furnishing department is its complete lines 
of 

Bath Room and Bath Tub Fixtures. 

Anything that pertains to the lavatory room can be had, and the prices 
will be less than is customary. 

All our house-furnishing goods are priced like the other department prices 
— on a small profit basis.

fill of salt, one teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, one teaspoonfnl of cloves,

INIoore. 

TLUM PUDDING— The following sim- 
ple plum pudding is not so rich as 
that Avhich graces the Christmas 
board of our English cousins, but may 
be recommended as lighter and more 
digestible, and with the accompany- 
ing turnt brandy and rich sauce Avill 
certainly prove very palatable. Mix 
together one cup of finely chopped 
suet and one cup of dark molasses. 
In the cup in Avhich the molasses 
was measured dissolve a teaspoonful 
of soda, in a very little warm water. 
With the suet and molasses mix one 
cup of sweet milk and three cups of 
sifted flour. Now add a teaspoonful 
each of salt, c'innamon and cloves and 
half a teaspoonful grated nutmeg; 
mix well, add the dissolved soda, and 
last of all two cups seeded raisins 
torn in two and two teaspoon- 
fuls of shredded citron. Before 
adding the fruit mix with it two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; this will pre- 
A'ent it from sinking to the bottom. 
Put the pudding in a greased mould 
or pudding dish, cover closely and 
steam three hours. When ready to 
serve, loosen carefully from the 
mould, turn upon the platter, stick a 
sprig of holly in the center and poiu" 
a little brandy upon the dish and over 
the pudding. Touch a lighted match 
to the brandy just as it goes to the 
tal)le. A simple wine or brandy 
sauce may be used, or the following: 
Yellow sauce — Cream one-quarter of 
a pound of butter and mix with It, 
gradually, a quarter of a pound of 
sifted powdered sugar, or light brown 
sugar. Stir over boiling Avater until 
it liquifies, then stir in the beaten 
yolks of two eggs; stir constantly un- 
til it thickens, remove from the fire 



and add a gill of brandy, or wine, and 
a very little nutmeg (grated). It is 
very nice to prepare a hard sauce al- 
so by blending one-fourth cup of but- 
ter and one-half cup sifted powder- 
ed sugar. Serve a little teaspoonful 
of this with each slice of pudding, the 
yellow sauce to be passed by the 
maid. The combination of the two 
sauces is especially nice. — ^Mrs. D. C. 
James, Homestead. 



CHERRY PUDDING^Beat together 
until light the yolks of two eggs, one 
tablespoonful of butter and one cup 
of granulated sugar; add one-half 
cup sweet milk. Stir into this well

half cup sifted flour, having mixed 
in the dry flour one measure of 
baking powder. Put into a greased 
cake pan two cups of seeded 
red Morella cherries, floured, pom- 
over them the batter and bake in a 
moderate oven. Serve with foam 
sauce. Beat one-quarter cup of liut- 
ter to a cream, add one cup powdered 
sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, 
the white of one egg beaten light; 
then add the remaining white, beat- 
ing until very light. This sauce 
should 'be prepared just before pud- 
ding is ready to serve.— Mrs. W. D. 
Edmundson.

cream more quickly. Beat with a 
wire spoon until a heavy froth is 
formed on the surface. Let stand a 
moment and skim into another bowl. 
Beat again and skim as before and 
so continue until all is beaten. In 
the intervals of beating, while wait- 
ing for the cream to settle in the first 
bowl, whip the cream in the second 
bowl. When all is stiff, it is ready 
to sweeten and flavor as desired. Do 
not whip until shortly before it is re- 
quired, and keep very cold as it goes 
back quickly. The cream for the 
bouillon should, of coarse, be left un- 
sweetened.

tablespoonfuls of sugar; flavor wirh 
vanilla. — Mrs. William Jones, Belle- 
vernou, Pa.

Return the milk to the fire and let al- 
most boil again; take off the fire, 
add the vanilla to taste and stir in 
the beaten whites of the four eggs 
and mix well. — Sara C. Walsh.

Ice Cream, Water Ices and 
Sherbets. 



PLAIN VANILLA ICE CREAM— Two 
quarts of milk, three tablespooufiils 
of corn starch, one and one-half 
pounds of sugar, one quart of cream, 
two tablespoonfuls of vanilla. Scald 
the milk, mix the corn starch smooth 
with a little cold water, and add this 
and the sugar to the scalded milk. 
Cook until thick, stirring constantly. 
Take from the lire and strain. AVhen 
cold add the cream and vanilla and 
freeze. 



VANILLA ICE CREAM— One and 
one-half pints of cream, one vanilla 
bean, yolks of six eggs, one-half 
pound of sugar. Put the cream into 
a farina boiler, with the vanilla bean 
split into halves. Beat the yolks of 
the eggs and the sugar together until 
light, add them to the hot cream, stir 
until the eggs begin to thicken, strain 
through a sieve, and, when cold, 
freeze. Serve in small blocks. 



PLAIN VANILLA ICE CREA:M No. 2 
—Three pints of cream, one quart of 
milk, one pound of sugar, whites of 
two eggs, one tablespoonful of vanil- 
la. Mix imcooked, stand in freezer 
until thoroughly chilled, then freeze. 



VANILLA ICE CREAM, CARAMEL 
SAUCE— To a quart of pure, rich 
cream add a scant cup of granulated 
sugar and vanilla to flavor: beat un- 
til the sugar is well dissolved and 
the cream a mass of froth. Freeze 
and pack as usual. Serve with the 
following hot caramel sauce: Melt 
two ounces of unsweetened chocolate 
over hot water; add two cups of 
light brown sugar, an inch lengtli of 
cinnamon bark, half a cup of new 
milk, and a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut: cook until it forms a 
soft ball when dropped into cold 
water; remove the cinnamon, add 



vanilla to flavor, and pour a spoonful 
or more, hot, over each serving of 
ice cream. The sauce will candy 
over the cold cream, forming a cara- 
mel coating which is very delicious. 



PHILADELPHIA ICE CREAM is 
made from thick cream, half of 
which is scalded, the sugar added, 
and the remaining half of the cream 
added cold. The vanilla bean, which 
is invariably used, is added to the 
hot cream. The bean is cut into 
halves, the seeds scraped out and 
mixed Avith the sugar, the sugar 
mixed Avith the hot cream. This is 
allowed to cool; then the cold cream 
is added and the mixture frozen. One 
bean will be sufficient for two quarts 
of cream, and eight ounces of sugar 
are allowed to each quart. The best 
confectioners do not use machinery 
in making ice cream. The process of 
freezing should be slow, and the 
beating almost continuous. This is 
done by hand with a large wooden 
paddle. No other method would be 
truly Philadelphian. 



VANILLA ICE CREAM— Two quarts 
rich cream, one pint new milk, one 
pound sugar and one teaspoonful va- 
nilla; mix well and freeze. Another 
way: Put milk and one cut vanilla 
bean on fire and boil slowly; strain 
through a wire sieve and, when cool, 
add cream and sugar and freeze. 



FROZEN PUDDING— One generous 
cup of milk, one-half cup of flour, 
three eggs, one cup of sugar, one 
(piart of cream, six tablespoonfuls of 
sherry wine, three tablespoonfuls of 
gelatine soaked an hour or more, au- 
other cup of sugar. AA'hen cold sift 
the flour and sugar together and 
make a custard of the milk, eggs, 
flour and sugar. When cooled, add

cream, sherry and gelatine and 
freeze. Strain all before freezing.— 
]Miss Hettie Taylor, BroAvnsville, Pa. 



GINGER ICE CREAM— Six ounces of 
preserved ginger, two tablespoonfuls 
of lemon juice, one pint of cream, 
one-fourth pound of sugar. Pound 
the ginger to a paste, adding grad- 
ually the lemon juice. Mix the sugar 
and cream, then add gradually to 
the ginger; press through a fine sieve 
and freeze. 



STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM— One- 
half pound of strawberry jam, one- 
half pound of strawberries, one-half 
pound of sugar, one pint of cream, 
one-half pint of new milk. Mash the 
strawberries and add them to the 
strawberry jam. Add the sugar to

the milk and freeze. >Mien frozen 
stir iu the sti'awberry mixtures. Re- 
pack and stand aside to ripen.. 



RASPBERRY ICE CREAM— One 
quart of cream, one pound of sugar, 
one quart of raspberries, juice of one 
lemon. Put half the sugar and 
cream on to boil in a farina boiler, 
and when sugar is dissolved stand 
aside to cool; add the remaining half 
of the sugar and the lemon juice to 
the berries, stand aside one hour, then 
strain through fine muslin. Add the 
remaining half of the cream to the 
sweetened cream, and freeze; Avhen 
frozen, stir in the fruit juice, beat 
thoroughly and finish. When canned 
fruit is used less sugar is required. 



PEACH ICE CREAM— One quart good 
cream, one cup sugar; place in freezer 
and half freeze.. Now add one pint 
peach pulp and another cup sugar 
and finish freezing. Pack and let 
stand two hours before using.— Miss 
Louise Herwig. 



APRHCOT ICE CREAM— One-half 
pound of apricot jam, one pint of 
cream, juice of one lemon, two table- 
spoonfuls noyau. Mix the jam and 
cream together, then carefully add 



the lemon juice and noyau; strain 
through a fine sieve and freeze. 



PINEAPPLE ICE CREAM— Three 
pints cream, one pint milk, two ripe 
pineapples, two pounds sugar. Slice 
pineapples thin, scatter sugar over 
tliem, and let stand three hours. Cut 
or chop the fruit into the syrup, put 
throiigh a fruit press; beat gradually 
into the cream, and freeze. Remove 
a few bits of pineapple and stir in 
cream when half frozen. Peach ice 
cream made iu the same way is de- 
licious. 



MAPLE OR CARAMEL CREAM— One 
pint good cream, one cup milk, one 
cup maple syrup, four eggs, one tea- 
spoonful vanilla. Boil milk, yolks of 
eggs and maple syrup. Strain. When

one hour; add the milk and cream 
and freeze. 



COFFEE ICE CREAM— One quart of 
cream, one-half pound of pulver- 
ized sugar, four ounces of Mocha or 
three ounces of Java. Have the cof- 
fee ground coarsely, put it in a farina 
boiler with one pint of cream and 
steep for ten minutes, then strain it 
through a fine muslin, pressing it 
hard to get out the strength; add the 
sugar, stir until dissolved; add the 
remaining pint of cream and when 
cold, freeze. 



ICE CREAM— Divide cream into two 
equal parts, using one part for cus- 
tard (skimmed milk will do for cus- 
tard). For custard use two eggs, one 
taolespoonful flour, one tablespoonful 
of corn starch (one quart); a pinch 
of salt; beat all together, pour cream 
or milk which has been brought to 
the boiling point into the mixture, 
stirring constantly; then put on fire

the syrup, boil five minutes and 
stand away to cool. Squeeze the 
juice from the oranges, add it to the 
cold syrup, strain through a cloth 
and freeze. 



SERVING OF ORANGE ICE— A nice 
way to serve orange ice is to fill it 
into baskets made from the skins of 
the oranges. You may, if you lilce, 
tie a ri1>bon to each handle. Fill 
these baskets at serving time. Dish 
them on a pretty little paper mat on 
a dainty plate and send them at once 
to the table. 



I'INEAPPLE ICE— One quart of 
water, one pint of sugar, one table- 
spoonful of gelatine. Boil this

THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



169 



equal parts of ice and salt. Serve in 
glass cups, either with or just after 
roast turkej'. Place the cups upon a 
fancy plate covered with a doily. 



PINEAPPLE FRAPPE— Grate one 
pineapple; put one quart of water 
and one pound of sugar over the fire 
to boil; boil for five minutes, add the 
juice of one lemon and the grated 
pineapple: talve from the tire, and, 
when cool, turn into a freezer and 
freeze, turning the dasher very slow- 
ly until the mass is like soft, wet 
snow. Serve in punch glasses. 



FRAPPE— The term frappe means a 
partly frozen substance. Cafe frap- 
pe is partlj' frozen coffee, and oi'ange 
and lemon frappe are lemonade and 
orangeade partly frozen. Turn the 
mixture into a freezer and turn the 
freezer slowly until the mixture is 
like soft, wet snow. Serve it in 
glasses, and pass at the same time 
either waiters or any thin cookies. 
Frappe is served at afternoon teas. 



ROMAN PUNCH— Four lemons, three 
oranges, one quart of water, one gill 
rum, two tablespoonfuls sherry, two 
tal>lespoonfuIs brandy, freeze hard. 
— Mrs. H. E. Moore. 



ROMAN PUNCH— Four large, juicy 
lemons, one quart water, one orange,

of unfermented grape juice; then 
stand aside over night. When ready 
to serve this may be thinned with 
plain water or ApoUinaris watei". 



ORANGE SHERBET IN ORANGE 
CUPS — Make the cups by cutting a 
slice from the top of each orange and 
removing the pulp and juice to use 



for the sherbet. Cut each cup into 
points and set away on ice. At serv- 
ing time place the cups on pretty 
plates, garnished with holly, and fill 
with orange sherbet, pressing, 
through pastiy bag and tube, upon 
each one a star of whipped cream. 



DINNER SHERBETS— Mint, ginger 
and tamarind sherbets may always 
take the place of the ordinary dinner 
punch. They are easily made by 
adding the main flavorings to a 
lemon-Avater ice. 



CLARET CUP— There are many vari- 
eties and as many recipes for claret 
cup, but one that usually meets gen- 
eral commendation is as follows: 
Place in a large bowl a quart of rasp- 
berries, sprinkle over them a cup 
of sugar, then add in thin slices two 
oranges, one lemon, a couple of apri- 
cots or peaches, half a small pineap- 
ple, one large banana, a thin peeling 
of cucumber skins; pour another 
cup of sugar over these and place on 
top of all a piece of ice about six to 
eight inches square and let stand for 
a couple of hours: before serving add 
two quarts of claret, one bottle of 
carbonated water and a small bunch 
of mint. More sugar may be added 
if desired. 

Cafe frappe and iced tea are very 
agreeable where claret cup may not 
be desii'ed. 



STRAWBERRY S H E R B E T— One 
qiiart of red straw^berries, one pound 
of sugar, one quart of water, juice of 
two lemons. Boil the sugar and

of apricots, one lemon, one-half 
pound of sugar, one quart of water. 
Boil the sugar and water together for 
five minutes. Pre.ss the apricots 
through a sieve, add them to the

grated pineapples and the juice of the 
lemons. Strain through a cloth, 
pressing hard to get all the juice, 
iireeze and add the meringue. 



FROZEN PEACHES— Take two 
quarts peaches, peeled and sliced, 
sprinkle with one pound of sugar and 
let stand two hours; mash fine, add 
one quart cold water and freeze the 
same as ice cream.— Miss B. S.

Canning, Preserving, Jelly Making. 



FRUIT PRESERA'IXG— Tlie secret of 
sxK-cessful frnit preserving' lies in the 
proper use of sugar. That tliere is a 
correct use of sugar and au incorrect 
use as Avell is easily demonstrated. 
Sugar long cooked with fruit ruins 
the flavor and imparls a pungency 
that is most disagreeal)le, while if 
the sugar merely melts in the kettle 
and is then taken from the fire as 
soon as boiled uj), the preserve is a 
delicious, delicate sweet far superior 
to the other process. 

Even in the stewing of apples can 
practical knowledge be put to spe- 
cial account. After peeling and quar- 
tei-ing the apples Aveigh and allow 
half a pound of sugar to a i)Ound of 
fruit. Cover the fruit Avith boiling 
Avater and cook gently until tender; 
then add the sugar and as soon as 
melted take from the fire. 

Rhubarb is stewed in the same 
Avay and is neA'er ropy Avhen finished. 
The amount of AA-ater \ised should be 
much less than in stCAving apples. 
Rhubarb should be Avashed. AA'iped 
dry and cut into inch lengths Avith a 
sharp knife. It should not be peeled, 
as much of the richness of flavoring 
and all of the delicate pink coloring 
Is thus lost. 



JAMS — In the making of jams from 
the small fruits this new method 
evolA'es quite a different condiment 
from that produced by the old-time 
process, as much cooking destroys 
their delicate flavoring. 

Raspberry .iam is niade in fifteen 
minutes by this method and would 
tempt an epicure to over-indulgence. 
Weigh the fruit and alloAA* three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit. Place the sugar in 
the oven to heat and the berries thor- 
oughly mashed, in a porcelain-lined 
kettle. If the berries are fresh, 
plump and juicy, no Avater need be 



added: if using an inferior grade of 
friiit, a cup of water to three pounds 
of fruit will be needed to augment 
the juice. Place in a moderate heat 
and after boiling cook for ten min- 
utes, stirring constantly; then add 
the sugar, Avhich by this time will be 
quite Avarm. The sugar aa'IU dissolve 
at once; when again boiling, allow 
five minutes to finish in a moderate 
heat: then bottle. 

StraAvberries are made into jam 
in the same way. This is an easy 
method to follow in the case of small 
quantities of fruit left over from the 
table. Often there is not enough for 
a second serving, and the fruit, if not 
used, will spoil. By making it into 
jam, eA-en if there is not sufficient to 
fill a bottle, it may be .set aside until 
a second or a third quantity is made; 
all then be heated together and 
a bottle filled 



JELLIES— Jellies are never improved 
by long boiling of sugar and juice. 
Currants are washed, stemmed and 
mashed, a very little water added 
and the fruit cooked for fifteen min- 
utes, then turned into a bag to drip. 
The juice is measured and three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar allowed 
to each pint: the sugar is then placed 
in the oven to heat and the juice in a 
porcelain-lined kettle on the stove. 
After boiling the juice for twenty 
minutes the hot sugar should be ad- 
ded. It will hiss as it falls in, and 
quickly melt. When it boils up once 
it is ready to strain. 

Currants, Avhen ver.v fine, may be 
squeezed in a bag to extract the 
juice, no previous boiling being 
necessary, Init results are sin-er with 
the cooke<l fruit. All jellies are 
made in the same Avay, quinces and 
crabapples being cut into small 
pieces, nearly covered AA'ith Avater 
and cooked until soft, then dripped.

THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



PRESERVES— In preserving plums 
weigh the fruit and allow three-quar- 
ters of a pound of sugar to each 
pound, heating the sugar as before. 
Pierce each plum with a sharp fork 
and cook about a quart of the fru'it at 
a time in enough water to cover, re- 
moving the fruit to a dish when ten- 
der. Add the sugar to the water, 
and when melted strain through 
cheesecloth, return to the kettle and 
add the fruit. If there is not suffi- 
cient juice nearly to cover the fruit, 
add more water and let the fruit sim- 
mer in the sugar for five minutes; 
then bottle tightly. 

Quinces, peaches and pears may be 
done in the same way, only half a 
pound of sugar being used, however, 
to a poiuid of the fruit. Quinces 
cooked in syrup, Avithout previous 
cooking in the water alone, grow 
harder with each minute's cooking 
and are most disappointing. If a 
rich, red coloring to the quinces be 
desired, the five minutes' cooking at 
the last must be prolonged. This 
tinting of the fruit can be gained in 
no other way. 

In filling jars with preserves, pro- 
portions should be kept in mind or 
the juice will be exhausted before 
the last jar is filled. It is well to fill 
the jars three-quarters full of the 
fruit before adding the juice— until 
all the fruit has been lifted from the 
kettle. The juice may then be dis- 
tributed among the jars, and if it 
appears to be running short, the fruit 
in one jar may be divided among the 
rest. 



SEALING JARS— When ready to seal, 
overflow one jar with the juice and 
seal that Avith the metal top before 
passing to the next. 

When fruits AA^ere allowed "pound 
for pound" in the old Avay, they were 
so sweet they could not spoil and 
were kept in an open jar or crock; 
but there was little flavor of the 
fruit remaining. In bottling, fill 
each can to overflowing, then screw 
on the metal top as tightly as pos- 
sible, standing the jar on its metal 
end to disclose any leakage, which 



would indicate that the top is defec- 
tiA'e or the rubber at fault. SerA'ants 
sometimes damage the lead edge of a 
can by raising it with a thin knife to 
dislodge the rubber. The jar is not 
alAvays spoiled by this vigorous treat- 
ment, which is often necessary, it 
must be admitted, to open the jar, 
for the metal tops are hard to turn. 
If the lid is bent, it may easily be 
hammered back to place by placing 
on a flat surface and gently tapping 
the bent edges. If the edge is 
broken, the cover is of no further 
use. It saves Avork to test the tops 
and make repairs before turning in 
the fruit. For testing the jars, fill 
half full of water and screAV on the 
top. If the jars are already filled 
and are found to leak, unscrcAV the 
top. add a second rubber and again 
fill witli the hot juice, or hot water if 
the juice is used. New rubbers 
should alAvays be used. 



PEACH MARMALADE— Pare, divide 
and stone the fruit and boil for half 
an hour, stirring continually; then 
add three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to each pound of fruit and one- 
fourth of the kernels blanched; boil 
for a quarter of an hour. The mar- 
malade will then be ready for the 
jars. 



PEACH BUTTER— Have peaches 
dead ripe; put through colandar; put 
on the stove and stir until smooth, 
then add one-half axuount of sugar 
that you have of peaches (by weight) 
and cook fifteen minutes, stirring con- 
stantly.— Mrs. Harvey Wilson, Bos- 
ton, Pa. 



APPLE JELLY— Quarter the apples 
without paring, cover with water, 
boil until the apples are soft; then 
pour all through a bag and let it 
drip imtil cold; afterwards press the 
bag a little, but gently, so the pulp 
does not go through. To every pint of 
juice add three^Duarters of a pound of 
sugar; let it boil about one-half 
hour, or until it will drop fi'om the 
spoon. To every three pints of juice 
use the juice of one lemon. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



175 



STRAWBEIIRY JEI.LY— To make 
strawberry jelly, mash and strain the 
strawberries, wliich should be a little 
under-ripe. Measure the juice and 
allow one pound of sugar to each 
pint. Boil the juice for five minutes; 
add 'the sugar and boil until it jellies. 
Try it by putting a little in a saucer 
and standing it in a cool place. If it 
forms a jelly, take it at once from the 
fire and turn into the glasses. 



QUINCE HONEY, a simple and inex- 
pensive sweet well worth a trial at 
the season when quinces are so 
abundant, and if it is bottled and 
sealed, it will keep a long time. To 
half a pound of grated quinces take 
three cups of granulated sugar and a 
cup of water. Pare the quinces and 
remove the core before grating. Boil 
the sugar and water until it spins a 
thread, add the grated quinces and 
boil until it is thick like honey. 



A GERMAN RECIPE— A very 
beautiful decoration for a table in 
midwinter is a dish of red and 
white currants, 'apparently fresh 
from the bush. The dish is easy to 
prepare, but it must be done in cur- 
rant time. Select fine bunches of 
perfect cvuTants, both red and white, 
and lay them in a large mouthed jar. 
Poll over them hot— not boiling, or 
the skins may burst— spiced vinegar 
and seal the jar till you wish to use 
them. Then pour off the vinegar and 
lay them on a dish. Spice the vine- 
gar by putting to each quart of white 
vinegar an ounce each of mace and 
cinnamon, half an ounce of cloves 
and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, the 
last to counteract the acidity of the 
currants. 



GREEN GRAPE JELLY— Pick the 
grapes from the stems and wash 
them. Put them in a porcelain- 
lined kettle Avith sufficient water to 
just cover. Boil for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally. Seq 
that each grape is mashed. Turn the 
mixture into a jelly bag and let drain 
over night. Next morning measure 
the juice and to each pint allow one 



pound of sugar. Bring the juice to a 
boil and skim. Add the sugar and 
boil for about fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, tiying every few minutes by 
putting a teaspoonful into a saucer. 
When it becomes solid quickly take 
it from the fire and turn into the 
glasses. 



SPICED GRAPE JELLY— Eight 
quarts of real ripe grapes, one quart 
of cider vinegar, one-half ounce of 
cloves, three or four sticks of cinna- 
mon; boil all together, strain, and to 
each cup of juice add one cup of 
sugar, and boil as any other jelly. 
This is excellent to eat with roast 
meats. 



HELTER-SKELTER— Take three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit. Put in a preserving 
kettle alternate layers of currants 
and sugar, and let it stand a few 
minutes so as to free some of the 
juice. Then move it forward on the 
range and add for each pound of cur- 
rants two oranges sliced with their 
skins on and half a cup of raisins 
stoned and halved. Stir frequently 
while cooking, and when quite tender 
mash with a potato masher. When it 
looks clear drop a little on a plate; if 
it thickens, it is done and should be 
put in glasses or jars. When cold 
pour over it melted pax'affine. This 
seals the jar hermetically and may be 
used on all kinds of jellies. 

TO CAN PEACHES- Pare and stone 
the peaches and to one pound fruit 
take one quarter of a pound of 
sugar; make a syrup of the sugar and 
water, enough for two cans at a 
time, and into the syrup while boil- 
ing place the peaches, and let them 
stew initil soft enough to pierce with 
a straw. Put them into cans, cover 
witli the syrup and seal while hot. 
Other fruit may be canned in the 
same manner. 



CANNED GRAPES— With granulated 
sugar and water make a syrup as for 
the table. Take grapes from stems, 
wash and fill compactly into self seal- 



176 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



ing jars. Drain off any water "which 
may remain. Set the jar in water or 
on wet towel to prevent breaking. 
Fill to overflowing with mad boiling 
water. Lay on lid and let stand on^ 
minnte. Pour off the water, All with 
boiling syrup and seal. — ^Mrs. C. A. 
Clark, Rehobeth Church. 



TO CAN VEGETABLEiS— Any house- 
wife who Avill follow carefully the 
instructions given, understanding the 
air contaminations, maj' can corn, 
peas and beans oetter than those pur- 
cliased. as the materials will probably 
be in oetter condition to start with. 
All preserving powders are more or 
less injurious and should never be 
used by tlie ordinary housewife, who 
does not understand the nature of the 
drug. Such things are dangerous. 
Powders sold under the name of pre- 
serving poAvtlers are, as a rule, sali- 
cylic acid. To be successful in can- 
ning, the cans must have either 
glass or metal tops without i)orcelain 
lining, the rubbers must be in good 
condition, the cans must be clean, 
and the vegetables must be picked 
perfectly fresh. Corn should be 
pressed or cut from the cob and 
packed at once into the jars. Ad- 
just the rubbers, stand the jars in a 
boiler, the ibottom of whicli is pro- 
tected by either a rack or slats; lay 
the covers on top carelessly, do not 
fasten them. Surround the jars half 
way up with cold water, cover the 
boiler, bring to boiling point, and boil 
continuously for four hours. Lift one 
jar at a time and fasten on the lid 
without removing it. Wipe the jars, 
and when cool, put them in a dark, 
cool place. Peas may be canned in 
the same way, w^ith the exception 
that each jar must be filled with 
water. Corn, being compact, does 
not require tliis. String b^eans re- 
quire cooking for only one hour and a 
half, but the jar manipulation is ex- 
actly the same. The lids must not be 
lifted and put on the table and then 
afterward put on the jars, or the fly^ 
ing dust will fasten itself and fre- 
quently contaminate the vegetables. 
It makes very little difference 



whether or not the vegetables shrink; 
let them shrink. There is sufficient 
hot air in the can to make all materi- 
als sterile. I never yet have lost a 
can of vegetables of any sort. 

To make rhubarb jam, allaw to 
each pound of rhubarb a pound of 
loaf sugar and three ounces of can- 
died lemon peel. Wipe the rhubarb 
and string it, then cut it up and place 
it in a pan Avith the sugar; leave for 
thirty-siix hours until all is dissolved, 
then strain away the syrup into a 
stew pan and boil for three-quarters 
01 an hour with the candied peel 
(cut very small): add the fruit and 
boil for anotlier three-quarters of an 
hour. 



FRUIT mar:malade and fruit 

BUTTER— The difference between 
these two is that one is fine and com- 
pact, and is usually made by putting 
tlie fruit, after long cooking, through 
a sieve: while the marmalade part of 
the fruit is left in pieces. The term 
marmalade in England, is always ap- 
plied to orange; and marmalades or 
preserves made from other fruits are 
called jams. 



PRESERVED CITRON— Five pounds 
of citron-melon, three pounds of 
white sugar, nine lemons, two ounces 
of green ginger root, two pieces im- 
ported citron, one small piece of 
alum. Directions: Pare citron and 
cut in thin slices, boiling until clear 
and tender in water containing the 
small piece of alum. When done, 
wash in cold water. Make a syrup 
of the sugar and juice of eight 
lemons, adding the grated rinds of 
two lemons and the ginger-root. 
Boil until clear and thick, then add 
the citron-melon and the two pieces 
of imported citron, cut in thin slices, 
with the lemon sliced and seeds re- 
moved. 



STRAWBERRY .PRESERVES— Stem, 
wash and weigh the fruit. Allow 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
and half a cup of water to a pound 
of fruit. Boil sugar and water until 
it spins a thread, then pour boiling 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



177 



hot over the fruit. When cool, cover 
well and stand in a cold place. Next 
morning pour off the juice, boil until 
thick and proceed as before. The 
third morning- drain off the syrup, 
cook until thick, add the fruit and 
boijl until thick as desired. Bottle, 
seal and label as usual. This method 
of preserving, which hardens the 
fruit, is excellent for such soft 
fruits as strawberries, cherries or 
plums. 



TO PRESERVE TOMATOES— Select 
lii*m, small, yellow tomatoes; scald 
just barely enough so the skins will 
come oft" easily. After all skins are 
removed drop into lime water and 
let stand over niglit. In the morning 
drain well and simmer in a rich 
syrup twenty minutes or more, until 
fruit looks clear. Add a few pieces 
of root ginger; this modifies any un- 
pleasant flavor. 



CURRANT RELISH— Five pounds 
currants (delicious) one pound seed- 
le.ss raisins chopped fine, five pounds 
granulated sugar, juice and grated 
rind of three oranges. Cook all to- 
gether one hour and can while hot. 
If oranges are not Aery juicy use 
four.— Mrs. Crabtree. 



SPICED APPLES— Take ten medium- 
sized, red cooking apples; put in a 
preserving kettle with water to half 
cover them; add three cups water, a 
few cloves and stick cinnamon, tied 
in a bag, and half cup strong vine- 
gai". Cover tight and cook till apples 
ai'e tender; then take them out care- 
fully and boil the syrup a little 
longer and pour over the top. If 
done carefully the apples will retain 
their color and look very pretty.— 
Mrs. Forrester. 



TRANSPARENT JELLY— Look over 
the fruit and put it in an earthen 
jar and immerse it in boiling water. 
When soft put it in a bag made of 
cheesecloth and suspend it from a 
nail and let drip, but do not squeeze 
it with the hands. Boil the juice 
twenty minutes on top of the stove 
in a porcelain kettle or a bright milk- 
pan; measure the juice, and for each 
quart of juice allow two pounds of 
sugar, which has been heating on an 
earthen platter in the stove oven. 
Stir the sugar into the juice and boil 
three minutes. Turn into a pitcher 
and strain through a starch-strainer 
into jelly glasses, and let them stand 
open until the next day. If these 
directions are carefully foUoAved, the 
result Avill be firm, transparent jelly. 



PEACH JELLY— To one pint of juice 
from cooking parings that have been 
carefully assorted and Avashed, add 
one poimd sugar and the juice of one 
lemon. Boil until thick and put in 
jelly glasses.— Miss Jennie Knox. 



SOME HINTS FOR CANNING AND 
PRESERVING— Use only the best 
fruits procurable and the purest 
sugar. 

Add enough sugar to preserve the 
fruit, but not too much to destroy the 
flavor of the fruit. 

In preserving, boil long enough 
that the syrup mixes well Avith the 
fruit; do not have it water5^ 

Have butters as smooth as pos- 
sible. Jams and marmalades pre- 
serve the pieces of fruit. 

To keep the fruit successfully, the 
closest attention must be given it 
when preserving.— Miss Helen Fan- 
sold.

then steam the beans until tender, 
then the onions for ten minutes. 
Drain and mix all together, then add 
the peppers. Place the picliles in 
two or three jars and over the top of 
every jar pour half a teacup of 
grated horse-radish. Heat enough 
vinegar to cover well, pour it over 
them boiling hot, place an inverted 
plate over each jar, then tie up se- 
curely and put a cover on top. Let 
them stand one Aveelc, then drain off 
all vinegar and throw away. Heat 
fresh vinegar with two cups of 
brown sugar, some sticlc cinnamon 
and ground cloves tied in a cloth 
and let it cook for ten minutes. Pour 
over the pickles and place fresh 
horse-radish leaves over the top.—

half a peck of tender string beans, 
remove the strings, cut off the ends 
and throw into a kettle of boiling 
Avater; cook until tender, but not so 
they Avill break, then throw a little 
salt OA^er them, drain and cool. Put 
them into glass jars (two-quart ones 
are best), add a spoonful of whole 
Avhite mustard to each can and a 
spoonful of grated horse-radish. 
Heat A'inegar enough to cover, and 
allow one teacup of sugar to every 
quart of vinegar. Cover the pickles 
and seal up. If preferred, the beans 
can be steamed in a steamer over a 
kettle of boiling AA'ater instead of 
boiling until tender. 



CAULIFLOWER P I C K L E— Select 



firm, white heads, cut apart each 
branch, leaving a piece of the stem 
on; Avash Avell in salted water, place 
in a steamer over boiling water until 
tender, then remove and sprinkle a 
little salt over them. Prepare a vine- 
gar by alloAving tAvo cups of brown 
sugar to each quart of vinegar, and 
three tablespoonfuls of Avhite mus- 
tard, and heat. Allow one large 
green pepper Avhich has been soaked 
in strong salt Avater over night (after

hot pour over the caulifloAver and 
scrcAV the covers on. 



SWEET TOMATO PICKLES-Allow 
four pomuls of sugar and tAvo tea- 
spoonfuls each of ground cloves and 
cinnamon to every quart of A'inegar. 
Have ready eight pounds of green 
tomatoes AA'hich have been chopped 
fine and drained. Cook the toma- 
toes in A'inegar fifteen minutes, then 
put in jars and coA'er closely. Place 
horse-radish leaves OA'er the top be- 
fore tying up, to prevent moulding. 



CUCUMBER PICKLES— Two hun- 
dred small cucumbers, tAA'o poinids of 
sugar, three tablespoonfuls of white 
mustard. three teaspoonfuls of 
black mustard, three teaspoonfuls of 
juniper berries, four or fiA'e green 
peppers according to the size, half a 
pint of small white onions. Let the 
cucumbers stand over night in salt 
Avater, then drain. Heat enough 
vinegar to coA-er the pickles, then put 
in the cucumbers and scald them, but 
do not let them boil. Drain off the 
vinegar and put the pickles in stone 
jars. Prepare a fresh A'inegar, add 
the sugar, mustard, juniper berries, 
peppers chopped fine and whole on- 
ions. When scalding hot, pour over 
the pickles. Cut up pieces of horse- 
radish root fine and add to eA^ery jar 
of pickles. Cover with young horse- 
radish leaves and iuA-ert a plate over 
the top of each crock, then tie up 
with old white muslin. 



GREEN PEPPERS PICKLED— Take 
two dozen large green Bell peppers. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



185 



Remove the seed by cutting a slit in 
tlie side— leaving the peppers whole. 
Cover them with a strong brine and 
let them stand t^\-enty-four hours. 
Then take them out of the brine and 
soak them in water for a day and 
night. Pour off this water and scald 
some vinegar, in which put a small 
piece of alum, and pour over them, 
letting them stand three days. Pre- 
pare a stuffing of two hard heads of 
white cabbage, chopped fine and sea- 
soned slightly with salt and a cup of 
white mustard seed. Mix it well and 
stuff the peppers hard and full. 
Stitch up, place them in a stone jar 
and pour over spiceil vinegar, scald- 
ing hot. Weigh them down and keep 
the jar tightly covered. 



PICKLED PEPPERS— Cut out the 
stem of the peppers in a circle, re- 
move the seeds and wash out in cold 
water; then fill each with a mixture 
of finely chopped cabbage, horse- 
radish, mustard seed, tiny cucum- 
bers, button onions and nasturtiums. 
Replace the pieces cut from the top 
and sew around w-ith coarse thread, 
r'ack in stone jars and cover with 
cold vinegar. 



CHOPPED PICKLE— Six large cu- 
cumbers, one peck of green tomatoes, 
one head of cabbage, four large on- 
ions, three large bunches of celery, 
four small peppers:, five cents' worth 
of mixed white mustard and celery 
seed, one gallon of vinegar, one-half 
teacup of grated horseradish. 

Sprinkle one-half teacup of salt 
through the above vegetables after 
they are chopped and let remain 
twenty-foiu- hours. Heat up in a 
weak vinegar at first, drain, then boil 
twenty minutes in clear, strong cider 
vinegar. Will keep well in crocks un- 
sealed. 



CUCUMBER PICKLES— Select small, 
long cucumbers of uniform size. 
Wash them in water with a cloth to 
remove the small spines. Pour over 
them a strong brine boiling hot, cover 
closely, and let stand all night; drain 
in a colander and let dry on a cloth. 



Make a pickle with the best cider 
vinegar, a very little ginger root, a 
few small peppers, and a little horse- 
radish root. When the pickle boils, 
throw in the cucumbers, cover, and 
let boil as quickly as possible for 
three minutes. Seal up hot in cans. 



NASTURTIUM— Pickled nasturtium 
seeds are an excellent substitute for 
capers, and they, with radish pods, 
make a nice relish for meats. Select 
the seeds as .soon as the flowers have 
fallen off. gather them on a dry day, 
let them lie spread out in the sun for 
a few days, then transfer to a jar and 
cover with well-spiced, boiling vine- 
gar. Radish pods shoidd be soaked 
in salt and water for three days; 
drain and cover with spiced vinegar. 



CABBAGE PICKLE— If found of cab- 
bage try this pickle: Select the 
Dutch red variety, though the white 
cabbage may be used. Boil in salted 
water till very near done, using cau- 
tion not to boil too tender so as to fall 
apart; let it drain thoroughly throug'i 
a colander. Place in a crock and pour 
meditim strength vinegar sweet2iie4 
to taste, and previously boilei with a 
tablespoonful of mustard s-^e-l, over 
the cabbage boiling hot. It will keep 
any length of time and is very nice 
to have in emergency. Another nice 
way is to chop the cabbage fine as 
for cold slaw, and cook until tender. 
Season with Ainegar, salt and pep- 
per and butter and seal in Mason 
jars. When needed simply warm up, 
adding more vinegar and salt to 
taste, and a spoonful of cornstarch. 



MUSTARD PICKLE— Two quarts 
cauliflower, one quart green toma- 
toes, one quart onions, one quart cu- 
cundjer, one quart beans, one quart

the following dressing: One cup su- 
gar, one cup flour, one tablespoonful 
mustard, two tablespoonfuls tiu-- 
meric. three quarts vinegar.— Mrs. D.

and other ingredients. A little SAveet 
cider or molasses and plenty of salt 
must be added. This is not to be 
cooked. Half of this makes a large 
quantity. 



MINCE MEAT— Prepare in the fol- 
lowing proportions: To tAA-o pints of 
chopped lean roast beef add the 
same amount of chopped suet, three 
times as much chopped apples as meat 
and suet together, or tAvelve pints of 
apples, three pounds of seedless rais- 
ins, three pounds of currants, care- 
fully cleaned, one pound of candied 
lemon, one-half pound pulverized 
cinnamon, two ounces of pulverized 
cloves, one half dozen grated nut- 
megs, three tablespoonfuls of salt; 
mix these ingredients together thor- 
oughly Avith one gallon of good syrup 
and pack in a stone jar. Mince meat 
thus prepared will keep for several 
months. In using, take from jar 
Avhatever quantity desired, put in a 
porcelain kettle and add sufficient 
sweet cider to cook for half an hour 
or more. If cider cannot be easily 
■procured, the juice of a large lemon 
in half a pint of water Avill ansAver 
the purpose of cider. While boiling 
hot. stir in one tablespoonful of flour. 
Lift while hot into pie tins covered 
Avith good pastry and bake in a 
quick oA'en. 

MINCE MEAT— Three pounds each of 
currants, stoned raisins, finely chop- 
ped apples, broAvn sugar, two pounds 
suet, cleaned and shredded, three 
pounds cooked beef, one and one-half 
pints sAveet cider, one tablespoonful

to taste. Cook until it boils five min- 
utes, put in glass jars. When ready 
to bake pies, add boiled cider aiid 
brandy to taste. 

MINCE MEAT— Five pounds beef 
(neck preferred), two pounds suet,

three pints boiled cider, one quart of 
water in which the meat was boiled, 
six heaping tablespoonfuls cinnamon, 
four heaping tablespoonfuls cloves, 
one pint of molasses, two tablespoon- 
fuls salt, one teaspoonful pepper, one 
and one-half quarts jelly (currant 
preferred), one-half pound new cit- 
i-on, shredded, three pounds new cur-

indefinitely. It is usually prepared 
about the first of November that it 
may be well "ripened" for Thanks- 
giving. 

For those who may, on occasion, 
prefer a copy to the original, the fol- 
lowing that may be evolved at short 
notice, will be found an admirable 
rule. 



MOCK MINCE MEAT— Six crackers 
rolled fine and soaked in two cups of 
cold water. One cup molasses, one 
cups sugar, one each of cider, melted 
butter, raisins and currants, two 
eggs, one tablespoonful salt, one

cup candied orange peel, one tea- 
spoonful each of cloves and nutmeg, 
one-half teaspoonful pepper, one glass 
brandy, sherry or sweet pickle. 



A TEMPERANCE INIINCB PIE— For 
the benefit of those who haveconscien- 
tious scrupples against the use of 
cider or brandy in pies, the following 
recipe is given: Three pounds of 
chopped beef with the liquor in which 
it has been boiled. Seven pounds 
Chopped tart apples, one pound of 
suet, three pounds of seeded raisins, 
one pound of currants, quarter of a 
pound of shredded citron, three 
pounds of sugar, a tablespoonful 
each of salt, cinnamon, allspice, 
cloves and a teaspoonful of mace, a 
pint of currant or grape jelly, a half 
pint of strong coffee, the grated rind 
and juice of two lemons, and a cup of 
vinegar will improve the taste. The 
whole mixture should be scalded as 
soon as made that there may be no- 
danger of fermentation.

Candy Making. 



TO THE white of au egg add its 
measure of water and beat together. 
Flavor with vanilla or lemon and 
stir in enough frosting sugar to make 
a paste or dough that will not stick 
to the fingers while working it. This 
is fondant, the foundation for many 
kinds of candy, and is of itself a 
pure and delicious confection. 

Replace the pits of dates with fon- 
dant and you have Date Hearts. 

Sandwich some of it between the 
meats of hickory nuts to make Nut 
Paste. 

Mix some with chopped figs or 
raisins for Fruit Balls. 

Press some about almonds for Al- 
mond Snows.jj 

Dip some— with a fork— into melted 
chocolate for Chocolate Creams. 

Leave the sweets over night to 
harden and you will discover that 
you have candy equal in many re- 
spects to French bonbons. 

Ten cents' worth of sugar will 
make an abundance for three people. 

Molasses candy poured hot over 
layers of pop corn and cut into 
squares when cold, or taffy pulled 
until it is clear, made into balls and 
flattened by a pinch, will prove 
tempting morsels. Twist oiled pa- 
per about each piece. 

Raisins, hazel nuts, preserved fruit 
and apple quarters dipped into a rich 
frosting make delicious goodies. 



CHOCOLATE CREAMS No. 1— Beat 
the whites of ;two eggs to a stiff 
froth. (ira^Ntfly beat into this two 
cups of confectioners' sugar; if the 
eggs be large it may take a little 
more sugar; flavor with half tea- 
spoonful vanilla and work well. 
Now roll it into balls (little) and drop 
on a slightly buttered platter. Let 
the balls stand for an hour or more. 
Shave five ounces of chocolate and 
put into a small bowl, which place 
on the fire in a saucepan containing 
boiling water. When the chocolate 
is melted, take the saucepan to the 



table and drop the creams into the 
chocolate one at a time, taking them 
out with a fork and dropping them 
gently on a buttered dish. It will 
take half an hour or more to harden 
the r-hocolate. 

CREAM CHOCOLATE CARAMELS— 
Mix together in a graniteware sauce- 
pan half pint of sugar, half pint of 
molasses, half pint of thick cream, 
one generous tablespoonful of but- 
ter and four ounces of chocolate. 
Place on the fire and stir until the 
mixture boils. Cook until a few 
drops of it will harden if dropped 
into ice water; then pour into well- 
buttered pans, having the mixture 
about three-fourths of an inch deep. 
When nearly cold, mark into 
squares. It will take almost an hour 
to boil this in a graniteware pan, but 
not half so long if cooked in an iron 
frying pan. Stir frequently while 
boiling. The caramels must be put 
in a cold place to harden. 



CREAM CANDY— Boil together two 
cups granulated sugar, two-thirds cup 
boiling water and two tablespooufuls 
glucose; when it hairs it is done. Re- 
move from the fire and when luke 
warm beat until stiff and creamy. 
Have ready your nut meats and 
fruit and mould your candy into 
shape.— Sarah Means, Homestead, 
Pa. 



CARAMELS- Two cups sugar, one cup 
boiling water, two tablespoonfiils 
glucose. Place on the fire and boil 
until it hardens when dropped in 
cold water. Remove from fire and 
put in a small teacup cream and a 
tablespoonful of butter and place ou 
fire again. Test as before, and when 
done, flavor with vanilla and pour 
out on buttered tins. When cold cut 
in squares and wrap in paraffine 
paper.— Sarah Means, Homestead, 
Pa.

THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



NUT CONSERVE— Take three pints of 
any fruit juice— preferably grape or 
currant. To eacli pint of juice add a 
pound of sugar, six oranges sliced 
thin, the juice and grated rind of two 
lemons, two pounds of raisins stoned 
and chopped, a pound of English wal- 
nuts and half a pound of chopped fil- 
berts. When the fruit juice has dis- 
solved the sugar add the other in- 
gredients slowly and cook for about 
an hour. The mass will become as 
thick as marmalade and is a rich and 
delicious sweetmeat. 



PEANUT BRITTLE— Shell and re- 
move the brown skins from one 
quart of roasted peanuts. Roll them 
unui they are Avell broken. Put a 
pound of granulated sugar into a 
saucepan; stir imtil it molts and 
lurns just a little brown. Add hastily 
the peanuts, mix and turn on to a 
greased marble slab. Roll with an 
ordinary rolling pin that has been 
dusted with a little of the peanut 
flour. The rolling must be done m- 
stantly and quickly. Cut into 
squares and break apart. After add- 
ing the peanuts you must work rap- 
idly, everything being in readiness 
before you begin to melt the sugar.— 
Elva Hageman. 



NUT BLOCKS— Chop fine half a cup 
of blanched almonds, the same quan- 
tity of pine nuts, pecan and Brazilian 
nuts. Pack then into a square 
mould. Chop fine half a pound of 
raisins, stoned, an equal quantity of 
dates and figs; mix them together and 
pack them also into a mould. Cut 
thin slices of the nut cheese and thin 
slices of the fruit cheese; put one 
slice of fruit cheese between two 
slices of nut cheese; press them to- 
gether and cut into blocks. 



PISTACHIO NUTS are imported and 
used for sweets. They are the fruit 
of the Pistacia vera. The nut is 
much the shape of a pea or ground 
nut, green in color, and has an al- 
mond flavor— in fact, much so-called 
pistachio ice cream is colored green 
and flavored with almond. 



CREAM NUT FUDGE— Two cups of 
granulated sugar, butter the size of a 
walnut, two-third cup of milk, vanil- 
la to flavor, one cup of chopped nut 
meats. Put the sugar and milk to- 
gether In a granite saucepan and 
heat rather slowly to boiling. Boil 
hard, stirring constantly, and when 
almost done add the butter. Test by 
dropping a little in cold water; when 
a soft ball may be formed, it is done. 
Take the mixture from the fire, add 
vanilla and nut meats and stir until 
it is smooth and will keep in shape. 
Pour into a buttered pan to the depth 
of half an inch, then check in 
squares. English walnuts and al- 
monds are the favorite nuts, al- 
though one or several other kinds 
may be used. Almonds should be 
blanched before chopping. 



COCOANUT FUDGE— Follow the di- 
rections given in the preceding re- 
cipe, substituting cocoanut for other 
nut meats. Freshly grated cocoanut 
is the best, although the prepared 
variety may be used. Grate the nut 
and let stand over night or dry in a 
slow oven without browning, so it 
will not be too oily. 

FRUIT FUDGE— Chop fine some can- 
died fruit, raisins, figs, dates and cit- 
ron—a cupful in all; or use only sev- 
eral kinds of fruit and about a fourth 
part of nuts. To make cream fruit 
fudge follow the directions given for 
making cream nut fudge, substitut- 
ing fruit for the nuts. 



MAPLE FUDGE— Two cups of maple 
sugar, two-thirds eijp »f milk, butter 
size of a walnut, vmniila. to flavor. 
Grind the sugar fine before measur- 
ing and proceed exactly as directed 
in cream nut fudge. If maple nut 
fudge is desired, add a cup of nut 
meats to the recipe. It is delicious 
with cocoanut, hickoiT or Brazil 
nuts. — A. S. 



CHOCOLATE FUDGE— Two cups of 
granulated sugar, two-thirds cups of 
new milk, two squares of cliocolate, 
butter the size of a walnut, vanilla to 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK.

flavor. Put the sugar, milk aud 
chocolate (grated) together in a 
granite saucepan and Avhen almost 
done add the butter. Boil, stirring 
constantlj^ until when tested in cold 
water a soft ball may be formed. 
Take from the fire at once, add va- 
nilla and stir- imtil smooth, heavy 
and cool enough to retain its shape. 
To facilitate this, stand the whole in 
a pan of cold water during stirring. 
Butter a shallow, square pan, using 
unsalted butter, and spread the mix- 
ture in this to the depth of half an 
inch. Check in squares. 



CHOCOLATE NUT FUDGE— To the 
preceding recipe add a cup of any 
preferred nut meats. Chop the nuts 
tine, add to the mixture as soon as it 
is taken from the fire. 



WALNUT FUDGE— One heaping cup 
of broken walnuts, two and one-half 
cups tine granulated sugar, one scant 
cup of milk, a piece of butter half as 
large as an egg. Place sugai", milk 
and butter over a hot fire and boil 
hard for four minutes. Beat all the 
time while cooking, then add the 
nuts; take from the fire and beat it 
constantly imtil the fudge is smooth, 
heavy and so cool that it will hold 
Itself perfectly in shape. "While beat- 
ing, as it begins to cool, add a tea- 
spoonful vanilla. Pour the fudge on 
a buttered plate and check in 
squares.— Miss Lyda Edmundson. 



PEPPERMINT DROPS— Put one 
pound of granulated sugar into a 
saucepan; add two-thirds of a cup of 
water; stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved, then with a sponge or piece 
of cheesecloth wipe down the sides 
of the pan to remove any crystals 
that may have formed. Boil ten min- 
utes and drop a tea spoonful into a 
bowl of ice water: if it forms a soft 
ball, remove from the fire at once 
and add the peppermint. If you like 
it strong, add seven drops of the oil 
of peppermint; if mild, five drops. 
When slightly cool beat Avith a 
wooden fork or spoon until it is of a 
creamy consistency and just right 



for pouring from the pan or from a 
pointed spoon on oiled paper. 



PEPPEK.MINT DROPS— Boil one and 
a half pounds of granulated sugar 
and one and a half pints of water 
till in dripping the last drops form a 
thread; remove from fire, add flavor- 
ing and stir till liquid begins to 
cream; then quickly pour in drops on 
paper. 



CANDIED POPCORN— Put into an 
iron kettle one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, three of water and one of pulver- 
ized sugar. Boil until ready tO' 
candy, then throw in three quarts of 
nicely popped corn. Stir briskly until 
candy is thoroughly and evenly dis- 
tributed over the corn. Take kettle 
from fire, stir until it is cooled a 
little, and you have each grain sep- 
arate and crystalized with sugar, 
taking care that corn does not burn. 
Nuts of any kind may be prepared 
in the same manner.^Mrs. Harvey 
Wilson, Boston, Pa. 



BUTTER SCOTCH— One cup molas- 
ses, one cup sugar, one-half cup but- 
ter: boil luitil crisp and pour on but- 
ered pans to cool. 



PEANUT CANDY— Take one pound 
(or two quarts), of nuts. Shell and 
mix with two pints of granulated 
sugar. Roll or mash nuts, melt 
sugar and stir in the nuts. Then roll 
on wet board and cut into pieces to 
suit. 



CREAM CANDY— Three cups of 
sugar, one and one-half cups water; 
boil until stiff, but not crisp; then 
add butter the size of an egg; pour 
in buttered pans to cool; as soon as 
cool enough to lift from pans pull un- 
till you see it dry on the bauds; j)u]l 
with tips of fingers, whicli wash and 
wipe quite drj-; do not grease or flour 
the hands. 



BUTTER SCOTCH— One cup of brown 
sugar, one cup of white sugar, one- 
half cup butter, one and onc-nalf 
tablespoonfuls of vanilla. 



198 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



OARAMEL.S— Two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-quarter of a pound of 
chocolate, one cup of milk, and a 
piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Boil till stiff (not hard) when tried in 
Avater. Stir all the time.— Miss Het- 
tie Taylor, Brownsville, Pa. 



C H O C O L A T-E CARAMEIjS— One 
quarter of a pound of Baker's choco- 
late, one and one-half pounds of 
light brown sugar, one-half pint of 
cream, nearly a quarter of a pound 
of butter, and one tablespoonful of 
vanilla. Break up the chocolate, add 
sugar, cream and butter and cook 
from five to twenty minutes. Add 
vanilla just before taking off the 
stove.— Mrs. Kinley MacMillan, Mc- 
Keesport, Pa. 



FILLED DATES— Take nice fresh 
dates and remove seeds. Cut a 
a marshmallow in two or three 
pieces and put one piece in each 
•date, press together and roll in 
granulated sugar. Another way: 
Take English walnut kennels and fill 
dates after the same manner. These 
make very nice wholesome sweet- 
meats.— Mrs. Theodore Demmler. 



MAPLE CANDY— Four cups maple 
sugar (or dark brown), one cup milk, 
butter size of an egg. Boil, stirring 



one way only; when not quite as 
brittle as for taffy add two pounds 
of English walnuts chopped rather 
fine and flavor with vanilla. Pour 
in shallow pans.— Miss Clark. 



CANDIED OHESTNTTTS^Shell as 
many c4iestnuts as will be required 
and drop them into boiling water, 
allow them to cook briskly for fifteen 
minutes, strain and rub off the thin 
outer skin. Dip each chestnut in 
white of egg and roll in white pow- 
dered sugar. When all are coated 
lay them on a sheet of white paper 
in a moderate oven to harden. Pre- 
pared in this way they are delicious. 



MOLASSES TAFFY— One quart mo- 
lases, one cup brown sugar, butter 
half the size of an egg. Put all into a 
six-quart kettle and let it boil over 
a slow fire until it hardens when 
tested in cold water. Now put in half 
a teaspoonful baking soda and stir it 
well; then pour it out into well-but- 
tered flat tins. When partly cooled, 
take up the candy with your hands 
well buttered, then pull and double, 
and so on, until candy is a whitish 
yellow. If flavoring is desired, drop 
the flavoring on the top as it begins 
to cool, and when it is pulled the 
whole will be flavored.

Coffee, Tea and Beverages. 



BOILING WATER is a very import- 
ant desideratum in the making of a 
cup of good coffee or tea, but tlie 
average housewife is very apt to 
overlook this fact. Do not boil the 
water more than three or four min- 
utes; longer boiling ruins the water 
for coffee or tea making, as most of 
its natural properties escape by 
evaporation, leaving a very insipid 
liquid, composed mostly of lime and 
iron, that would ruin the best cof- 
fee and give the tea a dark, dead 
look which ought to be the reverse. 
Water left in the teakettle over night 
must never be used for preparing the 
breakfast coffee; no matter how ex- 
cellent your coffee or tea may be, it 
will be ruined by the addition of 
water that has been boiled more than 
once. 



COFFEE No. 1— Use a mixture of cof- 
fee, one for strength, the other for 
flavor: two-thii'ds Java and one-third 
Mocha is considered the best. Use 
four heaping tablespoonf uls of fresh- 
ly ground coft"ee, one egg and one 
quart freshly boiled water. Put the 
coffee and egg into a bowl and beat 
thorovighly, add one-quarter cup cold 
water and put the mixture into a 
coffee pot and pour in the freshly 
boiled water. Boil gently from five 
to ten minutes, then stir down and 
place it on the back of the stove for 
a few minutes to settle. Coffee is 
improved by heating the beans just 
before grinding. 



COFFEE No. 2.— Take the same quan- 
tities as the above recipe. Beat 
the egg V a coffee together, add the 
entire quart of cold water and soak 
over night. In the morning heat 
gradually, and as soon as it comes 
to the boil stir it down and let it set- 
tle. It is not necessary to use egg 
in this method of making coffee. 



CHOCOLATE— Allow half a cup of 



grated chocolate to a pint of water 
and a pint of milk. Rub the choco- 
late smooth in a little cold water and 
stir into the boiling water. Boil 
twenty minutes, add the milk and 
boil ten minutes more, stirring it 
often. Sweeten to your taste. 

The French put two cups of boiling 
water to each cup of chocolate. They 
throw in the chocolate just as the 
water com^mences to boil. Stir it 
with a spoon as soon as it boils up, 
add two cups of good milk, and when 
it has boiled sufficiently, remove. 
Serve a spoon of thick whipped 
cream with each cup. 



COCOA— Six tablespoonfuls of cocoa 
to each pint of water, as much milk 
as water, sugar to taste. Rub cocoa 
smooth in a little cold water, have 
ready on the fire a pint of boiling 
water, stir in grated cocoa paste. 
Boil tTventy minutes, add milk and 
boil five minutes more, stirring often. 
Sweeten in cups so as to suit differ- 
ent tastes. 



EGGNOG— Beat the yolks of twelve 
eggs very light, stir in as much white 
sugar as they will dissolve, pour in 
gradually, one glass of brandy to cook 
the eggs, one glass of old whiskey, 
one grated nutmeg and three pints 
of rich milk. Beat the whites to a 
froth and stir in last. 



LEMONADE— Three lemons to a pint 
of water makes strong lemonade. 
Sweeten to your taste. 



PINEAPPLE-ADE— Pare and slice 
some very ripe pineapples, then cut 
the slices into small pieces. Put 
them with all their juice into a large 
pitcher, and sprinkle among them 
plenty of powdered white sugar. 
Pour on boiling watei". allowing a 
small half pint to each pineapple. 
Cover the pitcher and let it stand un- 
til quite cool, occasionally pressing

down the pineapple with a spoon. 
Then set the pitcher for a while in 
ice. Lastly, strain the infusion into 
another vessel and transfer it to 
tumblers, putting into each glass 
some more sugar and a bit of ice. 
This beverage will be found delicious. 



BLACKBERRY CORIHAL— Simmer 
berries until soft, strain and to each 
pint of juice add one pound white 
sugar, one-half ounce cinnamon, one- 
quarter ounce mace, two teaspoon- 
fuls of clove.s. Boil fifteen minutes. 
When cool, add lirandy to taste.— 
Mrs. E. M. J. 



TEA PUNCH— Put one tablespoonful 
of Ceylon or India tea into a largo 
pitcher, and pour over one quart of 
1)oiling water; cover the pitcher and 
stand it aside for ten minutes; strain 
and add a pound of sugar, the juice 
of six lemons and two oranges. 
Stand this aside until veiy cold. 
"\A'hen ready to serve add ice and 
Apollinaris. 



CURRANT PUNCH— Boil for five 
minutes two pounds of sugar and a 
quart of water; skim, add the juice 
of two lemons and one orange, strain 
aiid stir in a. pint tumbler of currant 
jelly. Stand this aside until very 
cold. When ready to serve add chip- 
ped ice and a quart bottle of Apollin- 
aris. 



GRAPE JUICE PUNCH— Boil to- 
gether one pound of sugar and half 



a pint of water until it spins a 
thread: take from the fire and when 
cool add the juice of six lemons and 
a quart of unfermented grape juice; 
then stand aside over night. When 
ready to serve this may be thinned 
with plain Avater or Apollinaris 
water. 



TEMPER A N C E PUNCHES— For 
many years the term punch was ap- 
plied to a mixture of frozen liquors. 
In these days, however, we have 
fruit punches, lemon punch, orange 
pimch. There are some tw'enty-five 
ditt'ei'ent sorts of temperance 
punches. They need not be frozen. 



RASPBERRY VINEGAR- Pour one 
quart of good cider Ainegar over 
three quarts of raspberries; after 
standing over night, strain and pour 
over three quarts of fresh berries; 
after standing several hours sti'ain 
again and sweeten to taste, boil, liot- 
tle and seal. A delightful and re- 
freshing drink. Dilute to ta.ste. A 
little fresh lemon juice added with 
the water is an improvement. 



RASPBERRY VINEGAR- Take four 
quarts red raspl)erries, put in a stone 
jar, cover with good vinegar, let 
stand tvventj'-four hours; strain and 
press out all the juice. Take mea- 
sure for measure of juice and sugar, 
boil half an hour. Bottle in self- 
sealing jars. Two tablespoonfuls in 
a glass makes a refreshing drink.— 
Mrs. W. T. Forrester.

METHOD OF REMOVING. 



Place bowl on table, spread stained part over it, 
pour boiling water on it from a height so as to 
strike the stain with force. 

Spread stained portion over bowl: pour boiling 
water on from a height, perhaps, of eighteen 
inches to two feet. 

If stain is fresh, place stained portion in milk and 
allow to stand. If the milk becomes too much 
discolored, drain milk ofl" and put on more. If 
stain is drv. and will not come out as above, use 
salts of lemon or Javelle water; pour on, allow to 
stand a few minutes, and wash thoroughly. 

Rub lemon on and set in direct sunlight. 

Rub with salts of lemon or Javelle water and wash 
thoroughly. 

Soak stained portion in alcohol; rub. 

Rub with same material if wet; if dry, soak and 
soften with vaseline; rub with benzine. 

Place in sunshine in soap solution. It is difficult to 
remove entirely, and recjuires patience. 

Rub from outside toward the center, using great 
care not to spread. 

Place goods on absorbent paper and press it with a 
hot iron. 

Wash in soap and warm water, not hot. 
Rub on wet and allow to dry. 

Expose to sun for a few hours. 

Treat the same as fruit stains.

THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



WORTH WHILE REMEMBERING— 
(By Mrs. Elbert W. Rockwood)— 
That a pound of leau beef and a 
quart of Avhole milk contain about 
the .same amount of nourishment, 
but the meat, althon.uh it costs more, 
is more valuable for food, as it con- 
tains the nutrients in more suitable 
proportion. 

That the popular notion that "fish 
is brain food" is a mistake, for emin- 
ent pliysiologists tell us that tish no 
more than any other nitrogenous 
food contril)Utes to brain ,i;rowtli and 
development. All nitrogenous food, 
such as fish, eggs, and so on, 
repair the waste tissues of the body, 
but fish is of no more importance 
than the others. 

That ham has a much better flavor 
if it is boiled for one hour and then 
baked two hoiu-s, with brown sugar 
sprinkled over it for the last fifteen 
minutes. 

That hollowed out ai^plos or beets 
make artistic and pretty cups to hold 
salad. 

That foiu' or five ounces of sugar is 
all that an adult in good health 
should eat with impunity in the 
course of a day. 

That corn meal is an excellent food 
for winter, as it contains so much 
fat. and when eggs and milk are 
added to it. it has a high nutritive 
value. 

That fruit, to l)e appetizing and 
lucious should be kept in a cool, dry 
place, and not on ice. 

That a very pleasing addition to 
the ordinary nut cake is a cup of 
raisins. 

Tlaat the use of a thermometer on 
the oven of a practical woman is an 
assurance of success in baking. 

That baking powder biscuit re- 
qiiire much more heat than bread; 
440 degrees Farenlieit is right for 
biscuit, while a temperature of 380 
degrees is better for bread. 

That sour milk and soda make a 
more delicate devil's food cake than 
the sweet milk and halving powder. 

That the success of whipped cream 
depends upon the fact that the dish. 



the beater and the cream are thor- 
oughly chilled in advance. 

That jelly keeps much better if hot 
paraffine is i)oured over each tum- 
blerful than when covered with pajjer. 

That altliough "hunger is the best 
.sauce," a daintily garnished dish is 
the next best. 

That cream sauce is veiy much im- 
proved l)y a thorough l)eating. 

That potato salad is )uuch more 
savory if mixed with the salad dress- 
ing Avhlle hot. 

That white grapes, asparagus tips 
and English walnuts, Avith whipped 
cream dressing, make a novel and 
dainty salad. 

That there is more need of common 
sense in culinary science than is or- 
dinarily supposed, for we cannot be- 
come a strong peojile mentally unless 
our physical beings are well nour- 
ished. 



WHEN PACKIXG EGGS-The yolk 
of the egg siioils much quicker than 
the -white. For this reason it is im- 
portant that the yolk should be sur- 
rounded with a layer of the white. 
If the egg is placed on the side or 
large end the heavy yolk will settle 
to the bottom and come in contact 
with the shell, which admits the air. 
If it is placed on the small end it 
will always have a layer of the white 
between it and the shell. Eggs ab- 
sorb odors easily, therefore only 
odorless materials should be used 
wlien packing them. 



CHEMISTRY OF FOODS— It is quite 
necessary for the ordinary housewife 
to imderstand the chemistiy of 
foods; it aids in the preparation of 
the same and in ari*anging menus. 
Where a menu calls for one succu- 
lent and one starchy vegetable, and 
neither can be procured in your 
neighborhood, substitute tlie ones 
which are accessible; for instance, if 
rice is called for on a menu, substi- 
tute potiitoes; if stewed cucumbers 
or squash, or even cauiflower is 
called for, and you can get turnips, 
cabbage or tomatoes, use either one 
of tliese in the place. 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



205 



A DAINTY GOLD LUNCHEON suit- 
able for afternoon may consist 
of chicken salad served with small 
finger rolls or thin buttered sand- 
wiches; after the salad comes ices, 
cake and fruit, and a small 
cup of black coffee is usually served 
last. The most popular manner of 
serving a luncheon of this kind is at 
small tables daintily covered with 
luncheon cloths or with only an em- 
broidered center piece showing the 
polished wood all round. Small 
bowls of floAvers on the tables are 
very decorative. 



RAISINS FOR THE TABLE— Select 
desirable bunches of raisins and 
pour boiling water over them the day 
before required; cover, and the next 
morning lay each bunch carefully on 
a dry napkin and set to dry in a cool 
place. ]ilauy brands of California 
raisins by this method become as 
plump as grapes, and all varieties 
are made more tender and attractive. 



FLAVORED SUGARS— Sugars with 
genuine flavors are finer and usually 
piu-er, as well as less expensive, than 
even the best quality of extracts. To 
make vanilla sugar cut an ounce of 
the bean into fine bits and mix it 
with half a pint of granulated sugar. 
Pound fine in a mortar, sift and use 
to suit the taste. The coarse remain- 
der is good in boiled custards and 
chocolates. 

SERVING OLIVES— The most attract- 
ive way to serve olives is to drain 
them, and then place them in a bed 
of broken ice on a small fancy dish. 
Olives are served at luncheons, din- 
ners and suppers. They are usually 
placed on the table at the beginning 
of the meal and left until the end. 



LEFT-OVER CEREALS-Should any 
cream of wheat remain over from 
Sunday's breakfast, pack it into an 
empty baking power can well rinsed 
witli cold water. Cover and put into 
the refrigerator. Turn out, cut into 
slices about a third of an inch thick, 
coat Avith flour and fry for Tuesday's 



luncheon. Most left-over cereals may 
be cooked in the same way, thus of- 
ten proving available material for 
nice luncheon dishes. 



TO PEAL PEACHES— In peeling small 
peaches with a knife too much of the 
peach is wasted. Have a smill wire 
cage similar to that made for popping 
corn, fill it with peaches and dip in 
boiling water for a minute, then in 
cold Avater for a moment, and empty 
out; this toughens the skinand enables 
you to strip it off, saving much in 
"labor, also in peach.— Mrs. Warren. 



COLD CREAM- The following is an 
excellent recipe: Put in an enameled 
saucepan two ounces of pure lard 
((unsalted), heat to boiling point, let 
cool and reheat; remove from stove, 
and as it cools stir in one-half ounce 
of pure glycerine, one-half ounce 
vaseline, one-half ounce oil of SAveet 
almonds and a few drops of any pre- 
ferred perfume; continue stirring till 
quite cold. Store in jars for u.se.— 
Mrs. W. C. W. 



RECIPE FOR CLEANING CARPET- 
Two bars Ivory soap, one-half pound 
borax. Boil soap and borax in two 
quarts water; add two gallons hot 
water (rain water best), four ounces 
ammonia, three gallons cold water 
and four ounces of ether. Set aside 
to get cold. Very good.— ]Mrs. :M. L. 
McClure. 



USEFUL HINTS TO COOKS— To 

shred raisins. Remove seeds with 
fingers first dipped in Avater, Do not 
put raisins into water. Cut them in- 
to narrow strips Avith shears. 

Measurements. A cupful is all a 
cup Avill hold, leveled Avith a knife. 

To divide tablespoonful into 
fourths. Make a cross cut through 
remaining half; repeat to get one- 
eighth in same manner. Same rule 
applies to teaspoon. 

Slightly beaten eggs. Eggs are 
slightly "beaten when they Avill run 
from the tines of a fork wlien pick- 
ed up. They are not separated. 

Well beaten eggs. When beaten 



206 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 






together imtil they are light ami 
lemon colored. 

To blend seasonings, sift them 
thoroughly together before adding 
them to mixture. 

To chop parsley. Pick leaflets 
from stem, wring dry in small piece 
of cheesecloth and chop fine on cor- 
ner of meat board, using small paring 
knife. 

To butter crumbs. If crumbs 
are soft use one-third cup of melted 
butter to one cup of crumbs. If 
stale use one-fourth cup of butter to 
one of crumbs, tossing lightly with 
fork to disfribute butter evenly. 

The insipid taste of prunes is 
obviated by stewing them with an 
equal quantity of raisins. Dried ap- 
ples cooked with cranberries give 
the same gratifying results. 



SOAP FOR CLEAXSINO CARPETS— 

Dissolve five poimds of soap in three 
quarts of water. Take from the liro 
and add a half pint of ox gall, two 
ounces each of turpentine and 
benzine, and one gill of household 
ammonia: stir frequently until cool, 
then pour into glass jars and cover 
tightly. When ready to clean carpets 
or other fabrics dissolve some of the 
soap in warm water and proceed as 
-o-ith the fuller's earth mixture used 
for cleaning carpets. Of course, it is 
understood that the carpet or fabric 
must be brushed free from dust be- 
fore the cleaning begins. 



WASHING FLANNELS— Have a tub 
half full of Avater that is more than 
warm, but not very hot, and make a 
strong suds with laundry soap of tho 
best quality. Add a tablespoonful of 
poAvdered borax. Shake the flannels 
thoroughly, then squeeze them with 
the hands, sop them up and down 
and, if necessary, rub the spots be- 
tween the hands. Do not rub soap on 
the flannels and do not rub the flan- 
nels on a board. Ring from the first 
suds and put into another of the same 
temperature, rinse through w^ater 
that does not contain soap; wring dry, 
shake vigorously and dry quickly. 

• Iron before they are quite drj' with a 



moderately hot iron, then press well 
Do not use borax for colored flannels 



BAY RI"^!— Genuine bay rum is mad 
by digesting in rum the leaves of th< 
bay plant (an aromatic shrub nativ( 
to the West Indies) and by distillinj 
the resulting liiiuid. The next mos 
reliable quality is made with the es 
sential oil obtained from the baj 
plant in the following manner: Mi3 
one-fourth of an ounce of oil of baj 
with a gallon of ninety-five percen 
alcohol and add gradually a gallon o 
water, shaking the mixture con 
stantly. If it should become cloudy 
the addition of a little alcohol wil 
clarify it. 



CLEANING FRUITS— To clean cur 
rants and other small dried fruitj 
place them in a colander and set 
in deep water. Rub the fruit thor 
oughly with the hands, lift out th 
colander and pour clean wate 
through it. Drain and dry befori 
using. Fruits are generally expose^ 
too long to dust while drying to 
suitable food until well cleansed. 



REFUSE FROM JELLY-MAKING- 

Apples, after they have been drainec 
for jelly, may be used for appliE 
sauce, but other fruits are not wortl 
the saving from an economic stand 
point, as they contain the refus< 
from the fruit which is frequently in 
dig-estibie and useless. Water an< 
sugar may be added, however, tht 
mixture allowed to stand where i 
will ferment, and then strained fol 
vinegar. Any of these materials 
make excellent vinegar with a pleas 
ant flavor. 

COCOA BUTTER— To make cocoa but 
ter, secure a large, fresh cocoanul 
and pour off the liquid it contains 
this is the water of the cocoanut am 
not the milk, as is generally under- 
stood. Break it open and extract th( 
white meat; peel off the brown coat 
ing and grate the white finely. 



CARE OF SILVER— Every goo 
housekeeper stores away silver 



not

iu use. wrapped piece by piece iu cot- 
ton flannel. Silver in daily use can 
be kept bright if washed iu hot water, 
dried perfectly while still heated on 
a soft cloth and laid iu a basket or 
tray with white or brown tissue 
paper at bottom and sides and on top 
to keep damp air from it. Now and 
then a little ammonia in the hot water 
is an advantage as it will remove egg 
and other stains. 



CLEANING FURNITURE— When fur- 
niture is soiled make a warm suds 
with white soap and a quart of water. 
Add to this a tablespoonful of table 
or linseed oil, the latter being pre- 
ferable. Wash the wood, if it has a 
polished surface, with a soft cloth; 
if the wood is caiwed. use a soft 
brush to take the grime from the 
crevices; wipe with a soft cloth. 



CLEANING CARVED IVORY— Clean 
carved ivory with a paste of dampen- 
ed sawdust and a few drops of lemon 
juice. Lay it on thickly, allow it to 
dry and then remove with a nail 
brush. 



A HOT OVEN— If the oven Is too hot 
you can cool it by putting in a dish of 
water. If it is too hot on top lift the 
stove lids 'which are over the oven. 



LEATHER— To clean and restore the 
polish to leather, wash the leather 
with a soft cloth dampened with a 
little warm water; dry it carefully 
and then brush it over with the 
whites of eggs whipped to a froth. 



TABLE SILVER— Add a table-spoonful 
of borax to a pan of hot soapsuds; 
put your table silver in it and let 
stand two hours. Rinse in clean 
Avater and polish carefully with a 
soft cloth or chamois. 

COLORED TABLE LINEN— Colored 
table linen sliould be washed in tepid 
water in which powdered borax has 
been sprinkled; wash (luickly, using 
little soap, and rinse in tepid Avater 
containing boiled starch; dry in the 
shade and when still damp iron. 



BROILING M E A T S— In broiling 
meats over coals never allow them 
to smoke. After the coals have burn- 
ed down somewhat throw on a hand- 
ful of salt to deaden the blue flame 
that arises. If the drippings from 
the meat takes fire, I'emove the meat 
from the stove and cool for a few 
moments. Do not try to blow it out. 



C E :\I E N T FOR RUBBER OR 
LEATHER— Dissolve an ounce of 
gutta percha in half pound of chloro- 
form. Clean the part to be cement- 
ed; cover eacn with the solution and 
let dry for twenty or thirty 
minutes. Then warm each part in 
the flame of a candle and press firmly 
together till dry. 



TOWELS— Towels should be dried 
thoroughly before being put away. 
If consigned to the linen closet after 
being ironed before they are thor- 
oughly aired, a mould called oidium 
forms on them, giving rise to a par- 
asite which is liable to produce skin 
diseases. 



BLACK CASHMERE— To clean black 
cashmere, wash it in hot suds in 
which a litle borax has been placed. 
Rinse in bluing water — very blue— 
and iron while damp. If carefully 
done the material will look equal to 
new. 



FADED RIBBONS— By adding a little 
pearlash to a soap lather, faded rib- 
l;)ons placed therein will be restored 
to their natural color. Faded breadths 
of silk can be restored if treated to 
a bath of this kind. 



PRESERVE PICKLES FROCNI 
:M0ULIHNG— Drop a few .slices, or 
perhaps a few gratings, of horse-rad- 
ish on the top of pickles in each jar. 
Tills addition adds piquancy to the 
cucumbers and preserves their crisi> 
ness. 



BROO.MS— If brooms are wot in boil- 
ing suds once a week, they will be^ 
come very tough, Avill not cut the 



208

carpet, will last much longer and al- 
ways sweep as If new. 



TO SWEEP CARPETiS— A newspaper 
wrung dry from water, torn in bits 
and scattered over a dusty cai*pet 
prevents a swirl of dust, cleans the 
carpet and shortens the process of 
sweeping. 



BALM FOR THE HAIR— To five 
parts of the best Bourbon whiskey 
add one part of pure glycerine, with 
a few drops of cologne water or 
other perfume. Apply sparingly two 
or three times a week, rubbing the 
hair well. This is one of the clean- 
liest and most useful dressings that 
can be used. 



A FINE METHOD OF WASHING 
LACE— Spread your laces on clean 
muslin — a towel or ironing sheet. 
Mix some starch with cold water, just 
enough to wet it. Spread this paste 
on the lace and let it remain undis- 
turbed until thoroughly dry; then 
shake off and your lace will be clean. 
This, by the way, is an excellent 
mode of extracting grease spots from 
carpets, or stains of any kind from 
l)edticks. 



FOR CLEANING CARPETS— Two 
ounces borax, two ounces salsoda. 



two bars of white soap and two 
ounces of ether. Boil borax, soap 
and soda together in two quarts of 
water for fifteen minutes, then add 
three gallons of hot water. After 
taking away from the fire add the 
ether. Apply with scrub brush, 
wipe with cloth wrung from clean 
Avater and rulj Avith dry cloth.— Mrs. 
C. A. Clark, Rehobeth Church. 



FACTS ABOUT COLORS— A spoonful 
of oxgal to a gallon of water will set 
the colors of almost any goods, if 
soaked in it previous to washing. 

A teacup of lye in a pail of water 
will improve the color of black 
goods. 

Napkins should lie in lye before 
being washed; it saves the color. 

A strong tea of common hay will 
preserve the color of French linens. 

Vinegar in the rinsing AA'ater for 
pink or green calico will brighten 
them. Soda answers the same end 
for both purple and blue. 



FINE CLEANING PREPARATION— 

Two ounces of white castile soap, 
one and one-half ounces of sulphuric 
ether, one and one-half ounces alco- 
hol; dissoh'e in one pint hot water, 
then add three pints warm water. 
Excellent for cleaning clothes.— Mrs. 
N. B. Sproat. 



How to Feed the Sick. 



MRS. H. J. POWER. 



SOUPS AND BROTHS— A diot which 
is adapted to the Avants of the sick 
must consist hirgely of dishes which 
are liquid in form, because an ii-ri- 
table stomacli. or one wliicli is in any 
way enfeebled l»y disease, is not 
equal to the demands which solid 
food wotUd make upon it. Therefore 
li(iuid food, which is so much more 
easy of digestion, must form a very 
important part of the invalid's diet- 
ary. Such dishes must be both pala- 
table and nutritious. The most im- 
portant class of liquid food consists 
of soups and broths. 



STOCK, OR BOUILLON— In making 
stock always begin with cold water. 
Salt should never be added until the 
meat is thoroughly done. If put in 
early it hardens the meat. To each 
pound of fresh, lean meat, allow one 
quart of cold AA-ater. HaAe the bones 
Avell cracked and extract the mar- 
roAA', which shoiild be put into the 
pot. Put the beef, bones and water 
into a covered A^essel and set where 
it will heat gradually. Let it boil 
Aery slowly for six oi* seA'en hours. 
Look at it occasionally to see if the 
AA-ater is sinking too rapidly. Should 
this occur, replenish Avith boiling 
Avater, taking care not to add too 
much. When it has boiled seven 
hours, pour it out of the iron pot into 
a crock, and let it stand, aa-cU coa'- 
ered, till the next day. Alwut an 
hour before it is AA-anted for use, re- 
move the cake of fat Avhich will have 
formed on the surface, and take out 
the meat and bones. Strain the 
stock back into the iron pot, through 
a na]ikin jilaced in a colander, so 
that no bones, meat or sediment shall 
pass. Set it over the fire, and Avhen 
Avarm throAV in a little salt to bring 
up the scum, Avhich must be skim- 
med off. Made in this way. this is 
the stock for bouillon: if, in the cook- 



ing, it be allowed to boil down one- 
half, instead of replenishing with hot 
water, it is souj) stock. With this 
stock, by the addition of different 
seasonings or vegetal )les, a great 
A'ariety of bouillons, or soups may be 
made. 



GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS— 
Stock is the most important part of 
soup-making— it is the basis of the 
soup. 

Soup stock cannot be made "in a 
hurry;" good soup requires two days. 

Fresh meat only must be used — it 
cannot be made from old scraps. 

The least bit of tainted meat will 
spoil a AA'hole mess of soup. 

Season in moderation— it is difficult 
to restore a soup which has been 
over-seasoned. 

Soup stock should be alloAA-ed to 
cool sloAAiy — if cooled too (piickly it 
Avill not keep so Avell. 

Do not alloAA' stock to become cold 
in an iron vessel— if it cannot be kept 
constantly warm on the stove, it 
must be put into an earthen crock 
until wanted for use. 

In winter any kind of stock ought 
to keep good for a AA'eek. 

In Avarm weather three days is 
al)out as long as it Avill keep. 

Vegetaliles should not be put into 
soup more than an hour liefore it is 
AA-anted; if put in too soon they make 
the soup sour and si)oil the tlavor. 

On the second day soup should not 
be alloAved to boil more than half an 
hoin- after ebullition begins. 

The difference between bouillon 
and soup is that the latter is ■'boiled 
doAvn." or reduced by i)rolonged boil- 
ing. Soup is richer, but less delicate 
than bouillon. Bouillon, also, gives 
the best tlavor of the meat. 

When milk or cream are to be 
added to soup, they should first be 



210 



THE PRESBYTERIAN COOK-BOOK. 



broiis'lit to a boil and added while 
hot. 

^^'hen eg'gs are added to soup, beat 
tliem thoroughly and add while the 
soup is hot. but not boiling. The 
best plan is to beat up the egg with a 
little of the warm soup, and then 
add it gradually. 

Recipe above for making bouil- 
lon, is that which gives the best 
article. However, it can be, and of- 
ten is, made on the same day that it 
is wanted for i;se, but it is always 
best if prepared the day before. If 
it is to be used on the same day that 
it is made, proceed as already di- 
rected until the six or seven hours' 
cooking has been com])leted. About 
an hour before it is wanted, remove 
the meat, emptj' the i)ot, and care- 
fully strain the stock back into it; 
then add seasoning and vegetables, 
according to the variety of soup or 
bouillon desired. 



BEEF-TEA— Fresh lean beef, one 
pound; cold water, one pint. Free 
the meat from all fat, gristle and 
bones, cut it into tine pieces, and 
soak it two hours in the cold Avater. 
Now, put it into a doxible boiler, and 
let the water in the outer vessel boil 
three hours. Then strain and season 
to taste with salt and i)epper. Skim 
off all fat and serve hot. 

BEEF-TEA— Lean beef, one pound; 
cold water, one pint. Chop the meat 
very fine and let it soak in the water 
one hour: put all into a stout bottle, 
set this in a kettle or saucepan of 
warm water, and let the latter boil 
one hour. Strain the beef-tea from 
the bottle, season and serve. 



MUTTOX BROTH— Lean mutton, one 
pound; cold water, one quart. Free 
the mutton from fat. and cut it into 
thin slices Avith a sharp Icnife; put 
it into a suitable dish with the cold 
water, but no salt, and let it boil un- 
til the meat falls to pieces — about an 
hour and a half. Strain it, add pep- 
per and salt to taste, and what other 
seasoning is desired, and let it sim- 
mer half an hour longer. Serve hot. 



VARIETIES- This broth can be en- 
riched by adding a teacup of hot 
milk five minutes before it is re- 
moved from the stove. It can also- 
be prepared with a tablespoonful of 
rice, previously soakeil in warm 
water. The rice should be cooked in 
a separate dish until soft, then 
pressed through a sieve, and added 
to the broth at the time that it is 
strained. It may be flavored with, 
celery, parsley, tomato, or any other 
seasoning. 



CHICKEN BROTH— Chicken, one- 
half: cold water, one quart; celery, a 
little. Chop the chicken into neat 
pieces, breaking the bones and re- 
moving all fat; put it into a small 
saucepan, add the water and celery, 
and let it simmer for two hours. 
Salt and pepper to taste, strain into 
a bowl, remove any fat that may re- 
main on the surface, and serve. 



CREAM OF RICE-Rice, one-half tea- 
cup; chicken stock, one (luart; milk, 
one pint. Wash the rice carefully, 
picking out all imperfect grains, and 
put it into the stock, made according 
to the last recipe. Let it simmer 
for one hour adding a little 
boiling water if it gets too low. Now 
take out the rice, rub it through a 
sieve, return it to the stock; season 
to taste, and, just before .serving, add 
the milk, which has been allowed to 
come to a boil. 

Invalids soon tire of plain beef-tea 
or plain broth, if given day after- 
day. This difticulty may be over- 
come, however, by using a variety of 
seasoning, which will render the- 
broths more agreeable to the palate,, 
and vary that monotony which. 
would otherwise attend their use. 

WHITE SOUP— Soup stock, one- 
quart: tapioca, one-half cup; cream, 
one pint: cold water, one-half pint; 
small onion, sliced; mace, a little. 
Let the tapioca be soaked over night; 
add to it the stock, and boil them 
together one hour. In another ves- 
sel put the cream, water, onion and. 
mace, and salt and pepper to taste..

Let this simmer twenty minutes and 
then strain it into the stoclv. Serve 
immediately. It must not be left on 
the stove. 



BISQUE— Tomatoes, one quart can; 
milk, three pints; flour, one table- 
spoonful; soda, scant tablespoonful. 
Put the tomatoes on to stew. Put 
the milk in a double boiler, reserving 
a cup to mix with the flour. Mix the 
flour carefully with the cold milk, 
stir it into the ))oiling milk, and cook 
ten minutes. To the tomato add the 
soda, stir it well, and then rub it 
through a strainer flue enough to 
keep back all the seeds. Now add 
to the milk, salt and pepper to taste, 
and a small piece of l)Utter; then add 
the tomato and stir all well together. 
Serve immediately. If half the 
quantity is made stir the tomato well 
in the can before taking out half. 
This makes a veiT delicate and nour- 
ishing soup for either an invalid or 
the table. 

SAGO BROTH— Soup stock, one quart; 
sago, one-half cup; egg, one yolk. 
Soak the sago two liours in a little 
warm water; add it to rhe stock, pre- 
viously warmed, and let them simmer 
gently one hour, stirring often. Beat 
the volk with a little of the warm 
brot'h, add it, let it boil up once, 
season to taste and serve. This is a 
nice broth, simple and nourishing. 
Eat with dry toast. 



SMOKED BEEF BROTH— Chipped 
beef, one-half pound; cold water, one- 
pint; sweet milk, one pint. Put the 
beef into a double boiler, and cover 
with cold water. Let it heat slowly 
—it must not boil. When it has sim- 
mered for an. hour add the pint of 
milk, which has already simmered 
in another vessel, and then remove it 
from the fire at once. Strain and 
season to taste. If this should be- 
come cool it may be rewarmed. in a 
double boiler, but it must not boil. 
Boiling will curdle the milk. After 
an attack of biliousness or of sea- 
sickness, this is easily retained by 



the enfeebled stomach, and it is very 
refreshing. 



MOOK CLAM SOUP— Take a piece of 
codfish four inches square; boil it 
for fifteen minutes each time, in two 
or three waters. Then pour off all 
the water and cover it with one pint 
cold milk and one pint of cold 
water; boil for one-half hour and 
strain. Season to taste. TJiis makes 
a very good substitute for clam soup. 
It can be made stronger or weaker to 
suit the palate. 



CREAM OF CELERY— Soup stock one 
quart; celery, three stalks; cream, 
one-half pint. Cut the three stalks 
of crisp celery into half-inch pieces 
and put them into a saucepan; add 
one-half of the stoclv and boil for one 
hour. Now strain all through a sieve, 
rubbing the celery through, putting 
the pulp thus obtained, together with 
the broth, into a saucepan, and add 
the other pint of stock; boil; set on 
one side of the stove to keep hot. 
Boil the cream and add it to the 
soup, stirring all the time. Season to 
taste with salt and pepper, and serve 
with small pieces of toast. 



5 A K E D P O T A T O— Select a nice 
potato and bake it in the usual man- 
ner. When it is done, cut off one 
end. With a forlv carefully scoop 
out the contents of the potato fron> 
the slvin; season it with pepper, salt, 
a little butter and a teaspoonful of 
cream; beat it with a fork until 
very light, and then put it back into 
the skin from which it was removed. 
Let it brov.n over the top in a quick 
oven, and then serve. This is a nice 
way to serve potato for an invalid 
or convalescent. By holding the po- 
tato in a napkin it can be easily man- 
aged Avith a forlv. 



CRACKER GRUEL— Crumltle a soda 
cracker into a cup of cold milk; lot 
it stand two or three hours. Now 
put it into a saucepan with another 
cup of cold milk; add pepper, salt

and pour over the toast. Cover 
closely and let it stand five minutes 
before serving. 



POTATO SURPRISE— Scoop out the
