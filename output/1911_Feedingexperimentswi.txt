FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD 

SUBSTANCES. 



Although the proteins have long had attention centered upon 
them because of their commanding position in relation to nutrition, 
it is only in very recent years that the progress of chemical investi- 
gation, fostered by the introduction of new methods of research, has 
begun to make our conception of these fundamentally important 
substances more exact. The role of the nitrogenous substances in 
both plants and animals has gradually been brought to light by a 
series of effective researches; but even to-day it is still common, 
despite the newer knowledge in the field of biochemistry, to read 
of the part played by proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in nutrition, 
as if these groups of compounds were each chemically homogeneous 
and, within wide limits, physiologically interchangeable. Not only 
have these food-stuffs been discussed in the past without more than 
the scantiest consideration of possible specific differentiations within 
the individual groups, but in nearly every investigation on nutrition 
the nutrients have been employed in those complex and often little- 
understood mixtures which make up the common foods. 

That any such indefinite combination of known and unknown 
organic compounds is an unsatisfactory and unideal starting-point 
in any adequate study of the laws of nutrition was appreciated by 
Carl Voit, the foremost student of this subject of the past generation. 
In discussing the necessity for an accurate knowledge of the food 
intake in the study of metabolism he says : 

Zu dem Zwecke ware es unstreitig am besten, konnte man nur reine, 
chemische Verbindungen (die reinen Nahrstoffe) z.B. reines Eiweiss, Fett, 
Zucker, Starkemehl, Aschebestandtheile, oder Gemische derselben geben. 
Da aber die Menschen und auch die Thiere nur selten solche geschmacklose 
Gemenge auf die Dauer aufzunehmen oder zu ertragen vermogen, so bleibt 
fiir die meisten Falle nichts anderes ubrig als schon durch die Natur zusam- 
mengesetzte Mischungen (die Nahrungsmittel) zu wahlen. Jedoch ware es 
wohl moglich und ganz verdienstvoll, die Grundversuche, nachdem vorher 
der Weg mit Hilfe der letzteren Mischungen gefunden worden ist, mit den 
reinen Stoffen zu wiederholen, obwohl sich dabei sicherlich im Wesentlichen 
keine anderen Resultate ergeben werden.* 

Note. — The expenses of this investigation were shared by the Connecticut Agri- 
cultural Experiment Station and the Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. In these 
experiments we have been further assisted by M. S. Fine and C. S. Leavenworth.

2 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD SUBSTANCES. 

Judging on the basis of such information as was available at the 
time when the preceding was written, Voit further stated in regard 
to the proteins : 

Die verschiedene Modificationen des Eiweisses haben hochst wahr- 
scheinlich sammtlich ganz die gleiche Wirkung auf den Stoffumsatz, jedoch 
liegen hieriiber noch keine genauen Untersuchungen vor.* 

Certain exceptions to the assumed physiological equivalence 
of the proteins of various origins have long been known, conspicu- 
ously in the case of gelatin. This nitrogenous compound, possessing 
many of the most characteristic chemical features of a typical pro- 
tein, was found to be inadequate as the sole source of nitrogen to the 
higher animals. Its lack of a constituent tyrosine complex and of 
sulphur was appreciated; and to this was often charged the in- 
sufficiency of its nutritive functions. It has remained for the newer 
researches on the proteins — those interesting studies of the past ten 
years which have unraveled so much of the structural complexity 
of the albuminous molecule — to raise new questions and place the 
problems of nutrition in a new light. It has been the structural dis- 
similarity rather than the likeness of the proteins which has aroused 
physiological comment. The rich fund which these investigations of 
the constituent amino-acid derivatives of the various proteins of 
both animal and plant origin have disclosed need not be presented 
here.j The more striking findings are rapidly becoming a matter 
of common knowledge in physiological circles. Thus it is appreciated 
that the zein of maize and the gliadin of wheat show distinctive 
features in respect to the yield of the different amino-acids obtain- 
able from them. Zein is distinctly deficient in comparison with most 
other proteins: it yields no tryptophane, glycocoll, or lysine. Glia- 
din is characteristically rich in the glutaminic acid complex. Other 
equally interesting illustrations might be cited. 

Are these different proteins, specific in respect to origin, biolog- 
ically differentiated and individually unique in chemical make-up, 
of equal value for the purposes of nutrition? If they are not, how 
are we to explain the uniformity, apparent or real, which is exhibited 
in the composition of the individuals of any species living under 
widely divergent dietetic conditions ? The flesh-eater and his herbiv- 
orous neighbor accumulate specific muscle-proteins, blood-proteins, 
and brain-proteins despite recognized differences in the nitrogenous 
intake. 

The problem here presented has been both simplified and com- 
plicated by the trend of recent studies in the chemistry of digestion.

Schryver, and T. B. Osborne, in the series of Monographs on Biochemistry, Longmans, 
Green & Co. ; also Die Pflanzenproteine, Krgebnisse der Physiologic, 1910, x, pp. 47-215.

So long as it was still assumed that the proteins are only slightly 
modified within the alimentary tract, it was not easy to appreciate 
how these widely differing amino-acid complexes could be converted 
into a common protein or group of proteins. But with the introduc- 
tion of the evidence that proteins experience a profound cleavage 
prior to absorption — that the organism is equipped with an outfit of 
enzymes easily capable of effecting such intense hydrolyses, and that 
the proteins in all probability normally disappear from the alimentary 
tract as amino-acid fragments and relatively simple polypeptides — 
our conception of protein assimilation has changed notably. 

It is, perhaps, too early yet to determine to what extent the 
theories of protein metabolism and reconstruction, which Loewi and 
Abderhalden in particular have championed, accord with the facts 
of experience. Whether the organism synthesizes blood and tissue 
proteins from the amino-acid rests of digestion, and thus only; 
whether there are no rearrangements whereby one amino-acid may 
give rise to another; and whether under these circumstances the 
synthetic power of the organism is limited to a choice by the mini- 
mum of all essential protein building complexes — the so-called " Bau- 
steine" — can not yet be profitably debated in detail. 

The problem of protein synthesis is further complicated by a 
consideration of the activities of bacteria in relation to the food-prod- 
ucts which enter the alimentary tract. It is now well appreciated 
that microorganisms grow and die in large numbers throughout the 
lower parts of the digestive tube, so that it is not uncommon to find 
the faeces to be composed in a very considerable degree of the bodies 
of dead bacteria. It is not unlikely that the organisms which thus 
perish in the intestinal canal are subject to autolytic or other diges- 
tive degradation by which their protoplasmic constituents may 
become available as food sources to the organism of the host. Bear- 
ing in mind the synthetic possibilities inherent in plant cells, such 
as bacteria represent, it is by no means beyond the bounds of reason- 
able interpretation to assume that the amino-acids first formed by 
digestion of food proteins may experience a synthesis into new forms 
of protein complexes prior to a subsequent digestion and utilization. 
Viewed in this light, the immediate hydrolysis products of our food- 
stuffs may become available only after they have been in greater or 
less part reconstructed by these preeminently synthetic symbiotic 
bacteria into products of more uniform character, possibly widely 
different from the original intake. Nucleoprotein synthesis, for 
example, may thus become referable to bacterial intervention. 

No one can say at the present time to what extent, if at all, 
such synthetic possibilities enter into the problems here discussed. 
The subject has recently again been referred to by Ltithje.* The

important point for us is that we must deal with such possibilities ; 
we must plan and interpret our nutrition experiments to-day in the 
light of these newer ideas. 

If we accept the synthetic theory of metabolism, disregarding 
the cooperation of bacteria, it becomes possible to understand how 
the lack of some fundamental unit, like tyrosine, tryptophane, 
lysine, or cystine may lead to malnutrition or death through the 
inability of the organism to construct normal protein and normal 
protoplasm, because of a deficit of essential structural complexes. 
The errors of a one-sided diet present a new point of view. The im- 
portance of these theories is enormous, not alone for the nutrition 
of man but also for the welfare of our domestic animals. Rational 
and economical feeding is based upon a correct interpretation. 

Considerations such as the foregoing certainly justify an exten- 
sion of experimental work in nutrition along the lines suggested by 
the rapidly accumulating data on the structure of the individual pro- 
teins. The theories must be subjected to the rigorous test of experi- 
ment. The relative and absolute value of individual proteins must 
be determined by physiological trials as a preliminary to definite 
and more permanent, rational dietary programs. We have attempted 
the beginnings of such a study. 

At the outset we were confronted by the fact that there are on 
record few, if any, successful experiments in feeding isolated food- 
stuffs. Still fewer are those in which the protein compound was fed 
isolated, in a reasonable degree of purity. By ''successful " we mean 
experiments in which the health and vigor of animals were main- 
tained under adequately controlled conditions for sufficient periods of 
time to permit of more than tentative conclusions . The total number 
of feeding trials in which the role of the protein food is in some way 
concerned is very large. We shall omit reference to all except those 
which bear specifically on the problems under consideration, viz., 
the significance of individual proteins in nutrition. 

It may not be amiss at the outset to point out the broader re- 
quirements which any adequate dietetic regime involves and upon 
which its nutritive success depends in good measure. In the first 
place the nutrients must be presented in a form that is digestible and 
thus available for physiological utilization. The physical texture as 
well as digestibility per se plays an important part in this respect. 
Again, the available parts of the diet must be adequate in amount 
to cover the calorific needs of the organism to which it is supplied, i. e., 
there must be sufficient metabolizable energy. One might be inclined 
to omit reference to such apparently obvious facts had they not been 
serious factors in previous experimental failures in feeding isolated 
food-substances. In recent years much emphasis has further been 
laid upon certain less evident considerations involving nutrition more

indirectly. Thus the question of the inorganic constituents of the diet 
is far from settled, and this aspect of dietetics can scarcely be said to 
rest upon any very rational basis. We realize the need of chlorine 
and phosphorus, of calcium and iron in certain vital functions ; but 
the physiological requirement of other elements is none the less 
definite because it is not fully understood. On one point, namely, 
the power of the animal organism to employ the elements phospho- 
rus and iron in the form of either organic or inorganic compounds, we 
have assumed that the consensus of opinion and the preponderance of 
experimental evidence are in favor of either possibility. The debate 
on this topic need not be reviewed here. 

Closely related to these nutritive requirements is the subject 
of those food accessories which determine in large measure what is 
spoken of as the palatability of any ration. They act in manifold 
indirect ways to influence the digestion of the nutrients by their effect 
in promoting or retarding secretion into the alimentary tract; they 
affect the appetite and the psychic element in digestion — all of which 
have received attention anew through Pawlow's efforts. After all 
one is as yet not justified in insisting that these incidental features 
of the dietary are absolutely indispensable. Quoting Tangl : 

Kine fordernde Wirkung der sog. Reiz — oder Wiirzstoffe — sagt Kell- 
ner — auf die Ausnutzung des Futters ist bis jetzt bei keiner einzigen der auf 
diesen Punkt gerichteten Untersuchungen beobachtet worden. Dasselbe 
gilt nicht nur flir die landwirtschaftlichen Nutztiere, sondern auch fiir den 
Menschen.* 

The undoubted biological importance of that rather vaguely 
defined and hetereogeneous group of compounds known as lipoids 
has raised the question as to whether they are at all necessary in any 
complete diet, or whether they can be synthesized by animals as 
they are by plants. The lipoids (phosphatides and cholesterols) are 
present as common cell derivatives in every familiar food and can 
only be excluded by special, laborious methods of extraction. It is 
not strange, therefore, that there is a paucity of evidence relating to 
their absolute significance as constituents of the food-intake. Recent 
experiments by Steppf on the indispensability of the ether-soluble 
constituents of the food for the life of mice are far from conclusive. 

I^astly, it seems worth while to point out that the nutritive 
conditions which pertain during the period of growth are in many 
respects — perhaps far more than is realized — different from those 
existing at a later period. During the active constructive phase new 
material must be supplied which differs both in quality and amount 
from the quota furnished as a maintenance ration. We realize well 
enough that the growing skeleton requires calcium; but to what

degree are the further nutritive demands modified by developmental 
changes? Are the same proteins which suffice the adult capable of 
supplying the essential building-stones to the young? Here again a 
wealth of new problems still confronts us. 

There are no recorded experiments on the larger animals, such 
as are commonly used in laboratory work, which furnish any con- 
clusive data on the broader questions involved in this research. The 
careful experiments of Rohmann and his pupils* on dogs fed with 
isolated proteins (edestin, vitellin, casein, myosin) extended over 
50 days as a maximum period in one case. Such investigations, as 
well as those of Abderhalden and his collaborators, f have yielded 
much of interest in regard to the utilization of the food-stuffs inves- 
tigated and have given valuable hints for future work in nutrition. 
But the periods of observation have been far too brief to permit 
any permanent positive conclusions regarding the adequacy of the 
proteins fed. Minor deficiencies may fail to become conspicuous in 
even comparatively long periods in the case of animals whose size and 
span of life indicate a considerable store of reserve material. 

For various reasons the most successful investigations in this 
field have been conducted on much smaller animals, especially rats 
and mice. The preparation of suitable pure food supplies on a scale 
sufficient for long periods and in economically procurable amounts 
is thereby rendered possible. The necessary scientific measurements 
and analyses can be conducted on a scale impossible for larger ani- 
mals, and the problem of care and attention is equally simplified. 
Experiments can be duplicated without great effort and individual 
peculiarities eliminated by force of numbers. Furthermore, the 
various stages of growth and maturity are completed in the smaller 
animals within relatively short periods of time, so that the permanent 
effects of any, dietary become apparent within a range of days or 
months that is not outside of ordinary experimental possibilities of 
observation. As illustrations of some of these features it may bp 
recalled that the ultimate effects, of complete inanition are apparent 
in four or five days in rats or mice; in dogs the fatal outcome may 
be delayed for many weeks. The duration of life in the white rat is 
about three years; about 280 days suffice to complete the entire 
period of growth to maturity. 

To what extent, if any, the rigorous conditions, such as restraint 
in cages, etc., set by laboratory requirements may modify the normal 
physiological functions of the small animals is not apparent from 
such records as we have found. It should be noted that both rats

and mice are reported to have been kept in health on milk alone 
during periods of six months or more.* So far as we are aware no 
experiments in which '* artificial" food mixtures were introduced 
have ever been carried on successfully for an equal duration. 

The most elaborate published nutrition experiments in respect 
to the variety of important details taken into consideration are those 
of Henriquest on white rats. He determined the changes in weight 
and the food-intake, as well as the complete daily nitrogen balance, 
in a large number of animals fed on artificially mixed diets. The 
isolated proteins used were casein, zein, and gliadin, with additions 
of sugar, lard, cellulose, and inorganic salts. J Only with casein and 
gliadin were the nitrogen balances favorable for the few days during 
which each trial was continued. This was true despite the gradual 
loss of body- weight noted in each case. It serves to emphasize what 
is frequently overlooked, viz., that a favorable nitrogen balance over 
a short period of time is in no sense an adequate index to a satisfac- 
tory nutritive condition. We have found that the body- weight of the 
rat is a more reliable guide to the real nutritive equilibrium of the 
animals than is the nitrogen balance. || 

Valuable as the experiments of Henriques and Hansen have 
been for the purposes of orientation in a new field of research, the 
failures can not be adduced as proof of the inadequacy of the pro- 
teins selected, nor can the apparently successful results be accepted 
as conclusive. For the latter point, the duration of the experiments 
is far too short, as will be seen from the work of subsequent experi- 
menters. The most serious criticism, perhaps, pertains to the food 
intake, which must have been within the lower limits of a maintenance 
ration for the animals which in many cases had not yet completed 
their growth. In respect to one conclusion the words of Henriques 
may be quoted : 

Wir finden also, dass es eine Wesensverschiedenheit zwischen der 
Bedeutung des Zeins und der des GHadins fiir den Stickstoffumsatz im 
Korper gibt; das Zein vermag kein Stickstoffgleichgewicht herzustellen, 
was dagegen das Gliadin vermag wenn es in reichlicher Menge gegeben 
wird. Der Grund dieser Verschiedenheit lasst sich naturlich nicht mit

Jit should be noted that these included "Knochenmehl" (p. 419-420). which is not 
entirely free from nitrogenous matter. Was bone-ash intended? 

lilt may be worth while to point out here that we have found very considerable losses 
of nitrogen, especially in hot weather, when urine is collected by the method adopted by 
Henriques and by us, which will be described later. Such losses, amounting to 10 per 
cent and over, would obviously lead to the assumption of a greater retention of nitrogen 
^than actually occurred and a consequent incorrect nitrogen balance.

Sicherheit angeben. Wir haben bereits angefijhrt, dass es beiden genannten 
Proteinen an Lysin abgeht. Dieser Mangel scheint also nicht von ent- 
schiedener Bedeutung zu sein. Dagegen scheint der Umstand, dass das 
Zein kein Tryptophan enthalt, eine grosse Rolle zu spielen. Ob das Nicht- 
vorhandensein von Tryptophan, in Zein wirklich der Grund ist, weshalb 
bei Fiitterung dieses Proteins kein Stickstoffgleichgewicht eintritt, muss 
sich iibrigens durch eine Untersuchung entscheiden lassen, ob das Stick- 
stoffgleichgewicht sich herstellen lasst, wenn das Futter Zein+Trvptophan 
enthalt.* 

The preceding quotation has suggested that the deficiency in a 
protein dietary need not be one of quantity ; the structural character 
of the nitrogenous intake may determine its adequacy. Willcock 
and Hopkins! have approached the problem from this view-point. 
They fed mice on zein together with non-nitrogenous foods and 
compared their length of life with that of mice which received in 
addition some of the missing fragments of this ''imperfect" protein, 
viz., tryptophane (and tyrosine for comparison). Zein was shown to 
be quite unable to take the place of a normal protein, like casein, in 
maintaining growth: 

The addition of the missing tryptophane group has no power to convert 
such loss (of weight) into equilibrium or gain — a fact possibly due to other 
deficiencies in the zein molecule, such as the absence of lysine. On the other 
hand, on the average, the loss of weight was slower with tryptophane than 
without it. But this result might well be expected, even if the tryptophane 
administered undergoes utilization without directly contributing to tissue 
formation or structural maintenance. If it serves as a basis for the elabo- 
ration of a substance absolutely necessary to life — something, for instance, 
of an importance equal to that of adrenaline — then, in starvation, or when it 
is absent from the diet, a supply is likely to be maintained from the tissue- 
proteids; the demand for it would become one of the factors determining 
tissue breakdown. In the case of young animals which directly benefit 
from the addition of a protein constituent, otherwise absent from their diet, 
to the extent of a well-nigh doubled life and marked improvement in gen- 
eral condition, but at the same time steadily lose, instead of gaining, weight, 
the utilization of the constituent would appear to be of some direct and 
specific nature, (p. loi.) 

The suggestion of a possibility of the direct formation of essen- 
tial hormones from amino- acid derivatives of proteins is timely. 
One can not draw any further conclusions regarding the value of the 
proteins (zein and casein) fed by Willcock and Hopkins, because in 
the absence of definite intake records, the question of a comparable 
and adequate supply of energy in the various cases remains undeter- 
mined. Special experiments showed that the prepared zein was ''in 
no sense actively deleterious." 

The same uncertainty regarding the real participation of in- 
anition factors applies to the earlier widely quoted experiments of 

*Henriques: Zeitschrift fiir physiologische Chemie, 1909, LX, p. n?-

Lunin* on mice. Some of the animals were fed on casein as the sole 
protein. They survived only a month or less on the "artificiar' diet, 
the author attributing the decline to defects in the intake of inorganic 
salts and other accessory foods. 

Abderhalden and Ronaf fed mice with casein, sugar, and sodium 
carbonate. The animals lived only 8 to 24 days on this obviously 
inadequate diet. 

Falta and NoeggerathJ recorded the changes of weight in rats 
kept on dietaries containing the nitrogen in the form of isolated 
(commercial) proteins: ovalbumin, casein, serum albumin, serum 
globuUn, fibrin, and haemoglobin. They fed no "roughage" in the 
form of cellulose. Neither these individual proteins nor mixtures of 
all were adequate to keep the animals alive longer than 94 days in 
the most favorable case. In most cases a gradual, steady decline was 
noted throughout the progress of the experiment. Death occurred 
when the animals had been reduced to two-thirds or three-fifths of 
their initial weight. The experiments clearly demonstrate the neces- 
sity of prolonged observation ; for rats were maintained on the casein 
food mixture during several weeks without loss of weight, just as in 
Henriques' briefer trials of three to four weeks. Only later did the 
untoward effects manifest themselves. On milk, milk powder, or 
lean horse-meat rats could be kept six months or more. 

The authors are properly guarded in their summary. They say : 

Ob in der Periode des Gewichtabfalles in unseren Versuchen die Tierc 
genugend Nahrung aufgenommen haben, um ihr Kalorienbediirfnis zu 
decken, konnen wir nicht sicher angeben. Der Befund von Nahrungsresten 
im Digestionstractus der toten Tiere (Lunin) ist unseres Erachtens hierflir 
keiu zwingender Beweis. Hier miissten genaue Stoffwechselversuche mit 
Beriicksichtigung der Kraftbilanz einsetzen. Erst wenn der Einwand 
ungenugender Nahrungsaufnahme oder ungeniigender Ausniitzung, fiir 
welche beiden Momente man vielleicht die Einformigkeit der Kost und den 
Mangel an Gewiirzen verantwortlich machen konnte, beseitigt ist waren 
andere Griinde zu erortern, wie z.B. der Mangel der notigen chemischen 
Bausteine oder ein abweichendes chemisches Gefiige der eingefiihrten 
Nahrstoffe. (p. 322.) 

Utilizing the experience gained in the preceding research, Knapp|| 
succeeded no better in maintaining his animals. He estimates the 
calorific needs of a 200 to 250 gram rat at 50 to 60 calories. The 
curves of change of body-weight and caloric intake go more or less 
parallel in Knapp's experiments and he notes that the specific role 
of individual nutrients can not be suitably ascertained until animals 
•can be induced in some way to eat the requisite amount of calories

in the form of the "artificial" mixtures. The danger of drawing 
erroneous conclusions is attested by the fact that he was unable to 
maintain his rats upon a variety of food articles : dog biscuit, graham 
bread, rice, etc., which one would assume to be adequate as mixed 
food. 

In explanation of his failures he says : 

Der Grund liegt hauptsachlich darin, dass die Thiere bei der reizlosen 
einformigen Kost den Appetit verlieren, im geringeren Grade wohl auch 
darin, dass die Nahrung mit zunehmender Appetitlosigkeit im Darm auch 
weniger gut ausgeniitzt wird. (p. i68.) 

It might have been expected that the difficulties here encoun- 
tered could be obviated by the use of animals in which forced feeding 
could be satisfactorily instituted. C. Voit* kept a pigeon alive 124 
days with peas by this method. Jacobf failed in repeated trials with 
pure food mixtures, and attributes his lack of success to the impos- 
sibility of adapting the physical texture of the introduced pure-food 
pellets to the requirements of the avian digestion apparatus, so that 
the pigeons died of inanition. He also attempted to advance beyond 
his predecessors in feeding "artificial" mixtures (with casein as the 
sole protein) to rats. He was scarcely more successful; the animals 
ate sparingly and he concludes that if it is possible to keep an animal 
alive 124 days, as he did, on a diet of the character noted, this 
must contain all the substances essential to life. The animals did 
not exhibit any gross pathological defects at autopsy, but all visible 
fat had disappeared. The next attempt, Jacob optimistically sug- 
gests, must be directed toward devising combinations which the ani- 
mals will eat : 

So gelingt es vielleicht doch, eine Nahrung aus reinen Nahrstoffen ohne 
Genussmittel herzustellen, welche alle zur dauerndenErhaltungeinesTieres 
notigen Stoffe im richtigen Mengenverhaltnis enthalt. (p. 60.) 

McCollumt fed both young and full-grown rats on complex 
artificial mixtures, in which edestin, zein, and sometimes casein, 
were the sole sources of nitrogen. They are the most successful 
experiments yet reported as regards maintenance of body-weight or 
growth on a restricted quality of protein intake. The chief difficulty 
encountered was that of anorexia, which the author attempted to 
overcome by frequent changes in the combinations of food-stuffs 
used and by addition of flavors. Some of the trials extended over 
more than 100 days without death; but the rats failed to maintain 
their weights, even with the most persistent coaxing of the appetite. 
Data regarding the food intake are wanting, so that the inanition 
factor (due to deficient calories) can not be excluded.

More interesting even are his studies on the growth of young 
rats. They made considerable gains in weight in experiments with 
the proteins mentioned — without casein in one series and with it 
in the other — and extending over from 56 to 127 days. But the 
curves of growth do not approach those obtained for normal diet 
by Donaldson, to which we shall have occasion to refer again. 
McCollum concludes that "the palatability of the ration is the most 
important factor in animal nutrition" and "the failure of previous 
efforts to maintain animals on a mixture of relatively pure proximate 
constituents of our food-stuffs was due to the lack of palatabiUty of 
such mixtures." 

Finally reference must be made to the very successful attempts 
of Rohmann.* The details have not yet been published. Mice could 
be kept indefinitely on a mixture of casein, vitellin, egg albumin, and 
non-nitrogenous nutrients. They became mature and produced 
young which thrived. With only a single protein in the ration, a 
decline soon set in. If casein and egg albumin were used to replace 
each other the grown mice retained their weight, but the devel- 
opment of the younger ones was checked and they succumbed. 
Rohmann concluded from these facts that the different proteins 
possess a different significance for the nutrition and the development 
of young organisms. 

Although none of our predecessors has returned a decisive 
answer to the fundamental question whether any single protein or 
combination of proteins is incapable of supplying all the essential 
chemical complexes which the body is unable to furnish to itself by 
direct synthesis, the pursuit of a solution by no means appears futile. 
None of the difficulties — actual or assumed — which have arisen 
appears experimentally insurmountable at present. The digesti- 
bility and utilization of the artificial rations has never been demon- 
strated to be abnormal or even unfavorable. The texture and 
inclusion of "roughage," such as is ordinarily a part of every mixed 
dietary in the guise of cellulose, can be experimentally adjusted, if 
indeed it is of any serious moment in controlling the mechanical 
functions of the alimentary tract. 

Monotony of diet appears to have been overemphasized, if one 
may judge by the success with which milk or egg yolk have constituted 
the only food material for rats and mice. The failure common to all 
of the recorded experiments has been attributed to the difficulty of 
inducing animals to eat sufficient food. Strictly speaking, it has not 
been determined as yet whether the notable anorexia is the result 
of some unpalatable feature of the artificial food mixtures and thus 
the cause of the gradual inanition, or whether it is really a physio- 
logical sequence of an imperfect dietary.

12 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD SUBSTANCES. 

The best hope of success — if such be possible — rests at present 
on the method of trial and error in which each variable is gradually 
eliminated by successive comparative experiments. This is the 
scheme which we have in large measure pursued. Our efforts have 
at first been directed toward devising a simple ration of isolated 
food components which should satisfy the numerous requirements 
set more adequately than any yet proposed. This established, 
substitutions could gradually be instituted in respect to the protein 
constituents. We learned before long that a diet which might be 
adequate for maintenance was by no means necessarily suited to the 
requirement of a growing animal. Hence our attention has become 
directed to some of the features of growth as well as those of the 
maintenance ration of the adult. 

METHODS EMPLOYED. 

The rats were kept in metabolism cages similar to that described 
by Henriques and Hansen.* A small door permits the introduction 
of food and water cups, such as are used in bird cages, through the 
side of the cage. 

Figure A shows the essential features. Instead of weighing the 
food (which was always fed in the form of a homogeneous paste) in 
the food cups, we devised the following very simple plan to avoid 
frequent weighings. The food is introduced into a glass cylinder 
about 25 cm. in length and 3 cm. in diameter. A rubber stopper in- 
serted into one end can be moved forward like a piston head and the 
food expelled from the other end of the cylinder into the food recep- 
tacle. The exit end of the cylinder is kept stopped when the food 
is not being expelled and the entire apparatus with its food content 
can be preserved in an ice-box for long periods without deterioration 
of the diet. The food eaten can thus be renewed at intervals and 
the quantity fed determined, when desired, by ascertaining the loss 
of weight of each food tube. 

Figure B illustrates our feeding-tube device. 

The urine and faeces were separately collected, the former in a 
receptacle containing boric acid and chloroform, and analyzed at 
intervals as indicated in the protocols. Control trials, made by 
trickling known volumes of analyzed human urine over the cage 
bottom, and, after a suitable interval, washing with boric acid solu- 
tion, collecting the urine, etc., just as in the rat experiments, indicated 
losses of 10 per cent or more. This must be borne in mind in consid- 
ering our results and presumably those of other investigators. j^ 

We devoted great care to maintaining suitable environmental 
conditions (temperature, etc.), since the rats are sensitive to marked 
changes. With our diets they consumed large quantities of water.

The success of the cage methods, as such, is shown by our abihty to 
maintain animals in good health for very long periods in this way. 
Confronted at the outset with the necessity of ascertaining 
whether the conditions selected — the caging, laboratory environ- 
ment, consistency of the food and the mode of feeding, etc. — were

endurable for the animals under any system of feeding, we under- 
took control trials with a mixed food in the form of dog biscuit and 
lard. This was prepared as follows : 

The dry dog biscuits were ground to a moderately fine powder 
in a mill and usually 70 parts by weight were mixed with 30 parts of 
melted lard . The mixture when cooled was reduced to a homogeneous 
paste by passing several times through a meat-chopping machine. 
In this way the paste was forced through small holes in numerous 
filaments, to which a rotary motion was imparted, insuring a very

complete and rapid mixing of the ingredients of the paste. This 
method of mixing was used for all of the foods described in this 
paper. 

A series of rats was fed with this food at the same time that 
other experimental diets were being investigated. In this way all 
the animals wexe exposed to the same indeterminable variables of 
cHmate and environment which might perchance have exerted an 
unsuspected deleterious influence and which would exhibit them- 
selves in the control animals as well as those under special observa-

tion. Like most of our trials during the first year of this work, they 
served chiefly for the purpose of orientation in respect to future 
procedure. It is scarcely necessary to record here the numerous 
individual experiments which resulted in a failure to maintain the 
rats in health and nutritive equilibrium. Failures, unless they are 
invariable in their occurrence, may well be due to accidents or inci- 
dents in no wise associated directly with the nutritive functions. 
Intercurrent parasitic diseases, incipient senility, hereditary defects, 
and other incidental features may be present or arise to interfere 
with the normal progress of an experiment. We have gradually 
learned to watch for such undesirable conditions and to exclude such 
animals as unsuitable for these studies, since proper allowance can

not be made for the perversions of function thereby introduced. 
For this reason we have been incHned to lay stress upon only those 
experiments which were either successful or which failed because 
of obvious causes. 

In selecting criteria of adequate growth the painstaking statis- 
tical studies of Donaldson* on the adjustment of size to body -weight 
and age in the white rat have been of great help. After birth the 
young white rat depends upon the mother for sustenance for about 
20 days. The span of life is about three years. Sexual maturity 
is reached in about 60 days. The first year of rat life corresponds, 
according to Donaldson, to the first thirty years of human life; and 
the growth curve for this period has been published by him. Some 
of the details are reproduced in Chart I. 

The lack of appreciation of the salient features of these curves, 
representing graphically the gross normal increase in weight of white 
rats during the first third of their life, has led occasionally to con- 
clusions which appear to us as quite erroneous. If, for example, a 
rat weighing 250 grams maintains its body- weight for several weeks 
without marked variations one may properly conclude that a normal 
nutritive equilibrium exists in such an animal ; on the other hand a 
rat whose initial weight is 70 grams is in a period of most active 
growth. Normal nutrition for an animal in this phase calls for a 
measurable daily increment in weight and a gradual, yet detectable, 
increase in body-length. Within one month a 70-gram white rat 
ordinarily will double its weight when the diet is adequate. The 
illustrations cited sufiice to indicate how different must be our cri- 
teria for the adolescent and the adult stages.

the entire body. Boas Memorial Volume, 1906.

EXPERIMENTAL PART. 
CONTROL FEEDING. 

A somewhat detailed protocol of the metabolism experiments 
on two of the ''control" rats fed on dog biscuit and lard, as already 
mentioned, will serve as a typical description of the conduct of all 
our feeding trials. Rat xii and rat xiii were caged separately on 
August 9, 1909. Fresh food-paste (see page 13) was introduced 
daily into the food dishes in excess of the amount eaten, which was 
at first ascertained daily. The body-weights were at first deter- 
mined every other day, as was the nitrogen of the excreta (urine and 
faeces) . Subsequently it was found adequate to estimate the nitrogen 
balance in weekly periods. The data thus obtained are summarized

These and other analytical data have been introduced in this 
paper in part reproduced in graphic form. In all of the charts the 
abscissa units represent days, and the ordinate units food (broken 
line) or body- weight (solid line). The food-intake curve is plotted 
from the total amount eaten per week. The average daily nitrogen 
balance is indicated as above ( + ) or below ( — ) the heavy line (o).

DISCUSSION. 



It will be noted that Rats xii and xiii, representing different 
ages, if we judge from the initial weights, were maintained in nutri- 
tive equilibrium without loss of body- weight during the period of 147 
days — a not inconsiderable fraction of the life span of these animals. 
There is, however, a gradual decline in the amount of food which is 
eaten toward the end of the experiment, the quantity in the case of 
XII approaching limits which must have necessitated some demand 
upon the fat supply earlier accumulated. The utilization of the 
protein continued satisfactory, thus evincing unimpaired digestive 
powers It is far from likely that the ration used, with its large 
preponderance of energy in the form of fat, is an ideal one. The facts 
recorded, however, exclude the probability that monotony of diet 
is an insurmountable obstacle to nutritive success.* 

As to the possibility of prolonged feeding on a uniform unchanged 
diet, two illustrations are appended of experiments on rats 14 and 
18 fed with a mixture of ground hempseed, starch, lard, and salts. 
These rats were first fed with a mixture of dog biscuit and lard for 
several weeks and then on the hempseed mixture. The composition 
of the food given during the different periods is shown in table III.

The figures for nitrogen are averages of the different batches of 
food which were made up from time to time. The hempseed meal was 
freed from the greater part of the hulls by sifting, but the different 
lots contained different proportions which escaped separation ; hence 
the actual nitrogen content of the individual batches of food varied 
somewhat. The figures given in the protocols and representing daily 
averages are based on the actual quantity of nitrogen fed, not on 
the averages given in table III. 

♦Among the many often unapparent difficulties which beset such experiments, the 
frequent occurrence of intestinal parasites and the susceptibility of the animals o 
digestive disturbances are to be noted. 

fThe salt mixtiu-e i, which contained organic and inorganic salts of the necessary 
bases and acids, is described on page 32.

FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOIvATED FOOD SUBSTANCES. 



Rat 14 lived 200 days without marked change in weight (losing 
less than 10 per cent) ; rat 18 (still on the same diet after 322 days 
at the time of writing) weighs very nearly as much as at the begin- 
ning of the hempseed feeding.

Chart V. — Rat 18 fed on Hempseed-Lard Diet for 322 days. Numbers on body-weight line 
indicate time at which each period began. 



Other trials with the same diets frequently led to a decline in 
weight and a loss of body protein. In nearly all of these cases the 
insufficient food-intake was adequate to explain the incipient symp- 
toms of inanition. Our numerous attempts to vary the flavor of the 
food and thus increase its palatability have been without striking 
success. Under exactly similar conditions of diet and environment 
different rats may continue to exhibit markedly unUke appetite for 
the same food. It seems best in the present stage of our knowledge 
to exclude from the diet experiments all animals which exhibit what 
seems like a temperamental anorexia. Protocols from some of these 
experiments are recorded here for comparison. 

Rats xxviii and xxix were fed throughout the entire period 
on the dog biscuit-lard mixture with the results shown in tables VI 
and VII.

DISCUSSION. 



The rats xxviii and xxix showed a steady decline on the dog- 
biscuit-fat mixture (p. 13). In considering the quantity of food 
eaten it must be borne in mind that the nitrogen content was rather 
low (N= 1.65 per cent). 

Rats 10, II, and 12 also showed, during the early period of the 
experiment, a steady decline on the same diet, although it contained 
more nitrogen . The temporary improvement shown after several weeks 
at the point marked 3 indicates the introduction of a change in diet. 
The improvement was, however, only temporary, as the charts in- 
dicate. The curves of body- weight in these animals recall those 
published by Falta and Noegerrath and correspond with the data 
of other investigators mentioned above. They indicate the type of 
experiment which is unsuccessful because of more or less obvious 
insufficiency in food- intake or stored supply. In the case of rats 
XXVIII and 10, for example, this is pronounced and a steady and 
continuous decline is noted. The decline of rat xxix, at first gradual, 
became extremely marked with the striking decrease in the food- 
intake at the end of the experiment. The other illustrations (rats 
II and 12) show intermediate types. As a rule, older, full-grown 
animals exhibit slower decline than younger rats (of smaller weig^ht)

because of the greater store of fat, etc. This helps to explain the 
long period of survival noted by various earlier investigators who 
have usually employed older (mature) animals for their feeding trials. 

THE CASEIN DIET. PREUMINARY TRIAI^S. 

More experiments of this sort have been carried on with casein 
than with any other protein as the sole nitrogenous component. It 
can readily be isolated in a state of comparative purity; and inas- 
much as it contains phosphorus in an organic complex, known by 
long experience to be assimilable, one of the problematical features 
pertaining to most other proteins is eliminated by its use. Our 
efforts have been directed toward finding a diet containing casein 
as the sole protein and which might meet the requirements of a long- 
continued experiment. In this we have been to a large degree suc- 
cessful in the case of mature rats. 

Our earlier trials were conducted with a variety of food-mixtures 
containing casein. It was soon apparent that the protein require- 
ment of the animals can be satisfied with comparative ease ; accord- 
ingly the ration was prepared with a nitrogen concentration of about 
2.5 per cent. The necessity for the use of much fat to insure the 
requisite paste consistency (and thus avoid scattering of the food) 
has put distinct limitations on the range of choice. We have tried 
without success to avoid the use of so much fat. To indicate the 
variety and proportion of inorganic elements which we have 
attempted to introduce, some of the mixtures are given in table XII.

It is still debatable whether any "roughage," such as cellulose, 
is absolutely necessary. McCollum* fed egg-yolk alone to white 
rats for i8 weeks without unfavorable results. Nevertheless we 
have introduced an indigestible residue as conforming more nearly 
to the usual alimentary experience of the animals; and agar-agar 
was selected because it is more easily manipulated than cellulose 
and because experience with other animals has shown us how efficient 
it is for this purpose. f

In order to compare the suitability of casein diets containing 
the salt mixtures recorded above, a series of trials was begun on rats 
which had previously been under observation in cages so that any 
eccentricity of eating or of metabolism might be noted. During this 
preliminary period the diet consisted of the dog biscuit mixture 
already referred to in the ''control" series. During the casein 
periods the following diets were used, which are indicated in the 
tables by the corresponding numbers.

DISCUSSION. 



The essential differences in these series lasting 42 days involve 
the inorganic constituents of the diet. All of the animals selected, 
with two exceptions (xi. and xui)* gave a fairly satisfactory record 
during a three weeks preliminary trial, whereupon they were selected 
for the casein feeding. It will be seen that the most promising 
nutritive conditions were afforded by mixture i, fed to rats xxxiii, 
xxxiv, and xxxv, in which the inorganic constituents were closely 
copied after Rohmann's successful ash mixture, with the addition 
of a little iron. During the first two weeks of casein feeding these 
three rats lost weight and nitrogen. This was caused by diarrhoea 
due to too great a proportion of inorganic salts in the food mixture. 
When this was reduced from 4.8 to 2.5 per cent a very rapid gain 
in weight and nitrogen at once took place. The superiority of the 
food mixture given to these three rats in contrast with the other two 
mixtures given to the other rats is plainly evident from comparison 
of these data. These experiments lasted 42 days and showed distinct 
gains in the nitrogen balance and also in body- weight during the 
period mentioned, f 

*These two animals were not pure white rats, but partly colored. They ate very 
poorly. We have gained the impression from observations on a large number of rats 
that these hybrid forms are not suited to our experimental needs and therefore have 
lately employed only the pure white races. 

fit may be noted that the apparently poorer utilization of nitrogen during some of 
the periods when little food was eaten is in part attributable to the fact that output of 
nitrogenous alimentary secretions continues despite the smaller intake of nitrogen.

FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD SUBSTANCES. 



THE CASEIN DIET — PROEONGED FEEDING TRIALS. 

The proportions of this food mixture (4, see page 33) thus tested 
were therefore employed in subsequent experiments as a typical 
"basal" ration. We record below the protocols of a few rats which 
for many weeks have been kept in good health on this dietary with 
pure casein as the sole protein. 

By an ill-advised plan these casein-fed rats were transferred dur- 
ing one month to cages containing sand, and the estimation of the 
nitrogenous excreta was omitted during this period. It was subse- 
quently discovered that the animals ate more or less sand during 
this time and we attribute the decline of weight and the subsequent 
death in some cases to a resulting damage of the alimentary organs, 
since sand was found in the faeces of some of the rats long afterwards 
and autopsy showed great congestion of the intestinal tract.

Chart XVI. — Rat 25 fed 176 days on pure Casein as the only protein. Diet 4, p. 33. 

These experiments, with rats 2j, 24 and 2j, extending over ijj-160 
days without noteworthy alterations in the weight and with a very large 
gain of nitrogen^ are, as far as we are aware, the most successful recorded 
attempts at artificial nutrition with a constant mixture of pure food- 
stuffs including a single protein. 

CASEIN AND VEGETABI^E PROTEIN DIET. 

Without reporting here the numerous trials and failures to 
replace part or all of the casein by other proteins, a few data from 
our records may throw light upon the difficulties thus encountered. 
The proportion of the nutrients is the same in these experiments, one- 
third or more of the casein being replaced by the proteins indicated. 

A casual inspection of the succeeding pages shows that the 
failure to eat is frequently sufficient to account for the failure to 
maintain body- weight and tissue. The animals lost weight to the 
extent of their fat content and then speedily succumbed with indi- 
cations of inanition rather than any specific pathological metabolism. 
Those rats which ate less than 40 grams of the mixed food were 
unable to maintain their nutritive equilibrium. A further evidence 
that no permanent defect is induced by the character of the diet is 
found in the observation that a change to a mixed diet of seeds and 
vegetables often brought speedy realimentation and recovery.

FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD SUBSTANCES. 



Despite numerous failures with other proteins than casein, sev- 
eral experiments have already been continued long enough to hold 
out promise of the possibility of ultimate success. In these the ani- 
mals were fed on a mixture in which the casein content was gradually 
decreased and then entirely replaced by vegetable protein.* 

Rat 1 6. — This rat, after a preliminary feeding on dog biscuit- 
lard diet, was fed through Period 2 with a mixture containing casein 
12, excelsin 6, sugar 15, starch 29.5, lard 30, agar 5 and salt mixture I 
2.5 per cent. This contained 2.74 per cent of nitrogen. During 
Period 3 the proportions of excelsin and casein were 9 per cent, 
the rest of the mixture remaining the same and containing 2.75 per 
cent of nitrogen. During Period 4 the proportion of excelsin was 
made 12 and casein 6 per cent, and the diet (otherwise as before) 
contained 2.8 per cent of nitrogen. Throughout Period 5 the casein 
was wholly replaced by excelsin, but otherwise the mixture was that 
above given. The nitrogen content of this diet was 2.94 per cent.

Rat 70. — This rat was fed during Period i with a mixture con- 
taining casein 9, pea legumin 9, sugar 15, starch 29.5, lard 30, agar 5, 
and salt mixture No. i, containing 2.5 per cent. This contained 
2.75 per cent of nitrogen. During Period 2, the diet contained 18 per 
cent of legumin as the only protein, the proportion of the other con- 
stituents being unchanged. The nitrogen content was 2.97 per cent.

Rat 7 1 . — This rat was fed during Period i with a mixture con- 
taining casein 12, glutenin 6, sugar 15, starch 29.5, lard 30, agar 5, 
salt mixture I 2.5 per cent. This contained 2.69 per cent nitrogen. 
During Period 2 the diet contained casein 12, glutenin 6, sugar 15, 
starch 24.5, lard 35, agar 5, salt mixture I 2.5 per cent, with 2.68 
per cent of nitrogen. During Period 3 the diet consisted of glutenin 
16.4, sugar 13.6, starch 22.3, lard 40.9, agar 4.5, salt mixture I 2.3 
per cent, and contained 2.60 per cent of nitrogen. Throughout 
Period 4, the diet contained glutenin 18, sugar 15, starch 14.5, lard 
45, agar 5 and salt mixture I 2.5 per cent. This diet contained 2.83 
per cent of nitrogen which belonged wholly to glutenin. 

Rat 71 is still alive at the present writing after 217 days of 
exclusive diet containing glutenin as its only protein, and 286 days 
including the casein and glutenin period.

porating in the food 10 cc. of water per 100 grams of the mixture. 
The nitrogen content of the different batches therefore varied from 
2.30 to 2.48 per cent. The actual nitrogen content of each batch 
fed was used in calculating the nitrogen balance which is given in 
table XXX. During Period 2, the diet contained pea legumin 18,

These observations have thus shown the sufficiency of the arti- 
ficial dietaries to maintain full-grown small animals for long periods 
of time (from 50 to 286 days) in nutritive equilibrium. In many 
experiments, such as Nos. 11, 14, 16, and 72, here reported, the 
animals died rather suddenly, without any previous period of notable

decline sufficient to explain their ultimate death. This fact strongly 
suggests that death was not necessarily attributable to any primary 
nutritive defect, but rather to incidental causes. Occasional fatali- 
ties will not surprise those who have experienced the difficulty of 
protecting a large number of rats, under the conditions noted, from 
the appearance of infectious or parasitic maladies which may become 
fatal. In the same surroundings sudden death has also come to not 
a few of our animals on ordinary mixed diets consisting of seeds and 
vegetables. In some cases obvious causes were revealed at autopsy ; 
but systematic post-mortem examinations have not been attempted. 

With young rats fed similarly we have succeeded in maintaining 
weight, although with little if any growth. In our preliminary 
studies of growing animals the food intake was not determined with 
appropriate care to correlate our findings with the altered curves 
of growth; hence the insufficient diet rather than any chemical 
deficiency may have been a possible cause of arrested development. 
Rats of 30 grams initial weight have been kept by us for many days 
without gaining weight when fed with a mixture containing a single 
protein ; with desiccated milk in the food they subsequently attained 
a perfectly normal growth. 

Despite the obstacles encountered we are inspired to the belief 
that with modifications in the feeding suggested by our first year's 
experiments still further progress can be made. Meanwhile further 
conclusions respecting the inadequacy of the individual proteins for 
nutritive functions are not justified.

SUMMARY. 

The problems of nutrition have been reviewed in this paper in 
the light of the newer knowledge of the chemical structure of the 
proteins. The possibilities of protein synthesis in animals and the 
conditions which this postulates ; the significance of the availibility, 
palatability, and physical texture of the food-intake; the suggested 
role of various accessories — inorganic salts, lipoids, etc. ; the distinc- 
tion between the nutritive demands during the period of growth and 
those of later adult life, are brought within the range of discussion. 
The literature on experiments in which isolated food-substances have 
been fed to animals is discussed in some detail, with a critical con- 
sideration of some of the essential conditions of investigation which 
are demanded in successful research in this direction. 

The methods of metabolism study with white rats used in this 
research are described and illustrated. Control feeding trials showed 
that the animals can be maintained in nutritive equilibrium and 
health for periods of many months under the conditions of experi- 
ment adopted. The failure to eat sufficient food is indicated as a 
cause for the unsuccessful termination of numerous experiments. 
The facts presented exclude the probability that monotony of diet 
is an insurmountable obstacle to nutritive success. 

Numerous experiments are reported in which casein formed the 
sole nitrogenous constituent of the dietary. In this connection it is 
shown that the make-up of the inorganic constituents of the diet ex- 
ercises an influential effect on the nutritive efficiency of the dietary. 
From the experience thus gained a "basal" ration was constructed 
on which rats were kept many months in good health. Some of these 
experiments in which the animals exhibited no noteworthy altera- 
tions in weight and showed a good gain in nitrogen are, as far as the 
authors are aware, the most successful recorded attempts at artificial 
nutrition with a constant mixture of pure food-stuffs, containing only 
a single protein. Satisfactory experience also followed the gradual 
complete substitution of the casein by other proteins, one animal 
continuing more than 217 days on a diet in which the sole protein 
was glutenin. 

With young rats it has been possible to maintain weight with 
dietaries like those just mentioned, although with little if any growth. 
The limitations of the method are discussed and plans for continued 
investigation indicated.

FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD-

PART II. 



INTRODUCTION. 

In Publication 156 of the Carnegie Institution of Washington* 
we have discussed some of the problems of nutrition which have 
been raised by the newer investigations in the field of protein chem- 
istry. The literature bearing on the feeding of isolated proteins was 
there reviewed in some detail, together with critical considerations of 
previously available experimental data. We described a plan for 
the study of metabohsm and illustrated a method of investigation 
in which white rats were the experimental animals. For the details 
involved, our earlier paper must be consulted. A few protocols were 
there presented to show that the outlined mode of investigation 
offered a promising means for attacking certain questions in the 
field of nutrition. 

INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS CONDITIONS ON NUTRITION OF WHITE RATS. 

Numerous contingencies may arise to modify or vitiate the re- 
sults of experiments in which animals are kept in cages and fed upon 
artificially prepared mixtures of isolated food-stuffs, quite independ- 
ent of the factors inherent in the food-stuffs themselves or the com- 
binations in which they are exhibited. Among these possibilities, the 
caging itself, involving continued restraint and limited opportunity 
for exercise, suggests an unfavorable environment. This factor can 
at length be disposed of. 

Donaldson has concluded, from the best data obtainable, that 
"the three-year-old white rat is very old, and is justly comparable 
to a man of 90 years, "f Rats have been kept in our cages in appar- 
ent good health and without difficulty during periods of more than 14 
months — a very considerable part of the span of life in these animals 
(cf. Charts XXIII, XXIX, XXX).

56 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED EOOD-SUBSTANCES. 

Monotony of diet has been urged as an obstacle to success where 
the same food mixtures are daily furnished without change over long 
periods of time. Very closely associated with this is the question of 
the palatahility of the diet. The two factors need, however, to be 
distinguished. The palatability of the diet has, perhaps, been over- 
emphasized in recent years in its bearing on the real nutritive value 
of foods. It applies primarily to the individual with highly organized 
nervous system and psychical functions. The quality found in foods 
which are unpalatable because they disgust or nauseate is something 
positive; the negative property of lack of palatability, i. e., absence 
of stimulating taste, etc., is not necessarily a serious obstacle. In any 
event the palatability of the diet is difficult to determine or regulate 
and in attempting to control it experimentally in animals physi- 
ologists have been guided very largely by anthropomorphistic con- 
siderations. 

We have now gathered observations which lead us to dismiss the 
idea that monotony per se leads to anorexia or other forms of nutri- 
tive failure in our animals, despite the comment which this feature 
has received from other investigators. There is no convincing reason 
why a continued unvaried diet should necessarily be unphysiological ; 
one need only recall the fact that the diet of all sucklings is the same 
from day to day, and that many of the domestic animals are satis- 
factorily maintained on rations which are scarcely altered in quali- 
tative make-up except at long intervals. We have observed rats in 
the same cage for considerably more than a year, during which the 
daily diet was invariably furnished in the form of our food-pastes. 
In some of these the composition of the paste was practically the same 
during these very long periods (cf . Charts XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, 
XXX). It is true that we could point to many failures to maintain 
rats on an unchanged diet continued over much shorter periods. One 
must not, however, here confuse monotony with the real cause of 
dechne. In these latter cases some deficiency or defect in the monot- 
onous feeding sooner or later brings on a physiological state where 
anorexia occurs ; and the advantage which a change of diet initiates 
ought primarily to be ascribed to the alteration in the food ingredi- 
ents rather than the relief from the sameness of the intake. 

Among factors referring more directly to the nature of the food 
itself, the physical texture and digestibility of the nutrients must be 
taken into consideration. The structure of the food materials may, 
under ordinary conditions of diet, influence its utilization in no small 
degree; and the low "coefficients of digestibihty" shown by many 
foods of plant origin testify to this fact. In our experiments the 
products fed were isolated and reduced to a state of very fine com- 
minution. At most, therefore, some inherent indigestibility of the 
individual foodstuffs employed might be concerned. Experiments 



INTRODUCTION. 57 

by M. S. Fine,* while they do not completely do away with this 
possibility, make it more evident than before that incomplete diges- 
tion is, in the case of plant products, for the most part associated 
with the peculiar vegetable tissues therein contained, rather than a 
specific resistance of the isolated nutrients. 

The need of ''roughage" to facilitate the normal evacuation of 
the gut has also been debated. We have, as a general procedure, 
added the indigestible polysaccharide carbohydrate agar-agar to food- 
pastes in order to approximate more nearly the conditions which 
prevail where cellulose enters into the mixed dietary. It can not be 
maintained, however, that this is necessary for satisfactory nutrition ; 
for we have maintained animals over a year on foods (cf. Chart 
XXIX) devoid of indigestible principles, if perhaps an exception be 
made of some of the inorganic ingredients. It is w^ell known that 
inorganic salts, notably bone ash, may exert the same influence as 
cellulose in giving bulk to the faeces ; and they are often so employed 
in the technique of metabolism experiments at the present time.f 

Aside from the proteins, in which our experimental interest has 
been primarily centered, our attention has been drawn more and 
more to those components of the diet which are not sources of energy, 
yet fundamentally indispensable — namely, the inorganic compounds. 
It is possible that further investigation will compel the inclusion of 
some of the more vaguely defined and unknown members of the 
groups spoken of as extractives, lipoids, etc., in this category. Every 
attempt made by us to approach the solution of the problem of 
inorganic salts in the dietary has brought fresh surprises. 

When ForsterJ fed dogs and pigeons on salt-free foods he made 
the interesting observation that the animals speedily died — more 
rapidly even than when all food was withheld. He concluded : 

Der im Uebrigen in Stickstoffgleichgewicht sich befindende thierische 
Organismus bedarf zu seiner Erhaltung der Zufuhr gewissen Salze; sinkt 
die Zufuhr unter einer gewisse Grenze oder wird sie ganzlich aufgehoben, 
so gibt der Korper Salze ab und geht daran zu Grunde. 

The classic experiments of IvUnin§ on mice led to a somewhat 
different interpretation of the need of salts. He showed that the 
animals survived longer on a diet containing an addition of sodium 
carbonate to the ash-free food than when sodium chloride was added. 
In the latter case the duration of life corresponded approximately 
with that observed on a salt-free dietary. From these facts it was 
argued that the foremost value of the sodium lies in its capacity to 
neutralize the acids (sulphuric, phosphoric) formed in the metabolism

of proteins. Sodium chloride obviously has no potential neutraliz- 
ing power. If the usefulness of the salts were associated solely with 
their specific character as salts, the salts of sodium ought to be some- 
what comparably efficient. 

The function of the inorganic salts is by no means exhausted, how- 
ever, by the simple action of chemical equilibrium. It would lead us 
too far afield in this place to discuss the problem in detail. Charts 
XI, XII, and XIII, Part I, pp. 38-39) showing the marked differences 
induced by alterations in the inorganic salts of the diet, the other 
food components remaining unchanged, are highly suggestive. We 
have since then made numerous attempts to improve upon the salt 
mixture empirically selected and prepared somewhat in imitation of 
the ash of milk. Rats were kept alive (while they steadily declined) 
84 days on a food mixture which analysis showed to contain only 
minimal, inevitable traces of ash (o. 16 per cent, a considerable part of 
which was phosphoric acid derived from the casein) . Chlorides were 
entirely lacking, distilled water being furnished for drinking. In 
view of this it is necessary to proceed with extreme caution in draw- 
ing conclusions from observations extending over brief periods. We 
shall refer to the subject again, it being sufficient here to emphasize 
the subtle and specific value of the salts. The lack of knowledge in 
this field has furnished an obstacle which we have only lately suc- 
ceeded in overcoming in part. 

Even when all these varied conditions are taken into account, 
there still remain, as we have pointed out before, extraneous inci- 
dents and accidental factors apart from nutrition itself, which may 
complicate or vitiate experiments like those projected. Disease, old 
age, injury, may be mentioned in illustration. Failures to maintain 
nutrition successfully under such extreme conditions do not neces- 
sarily imply a deficiency or inadequacy of the dietary. Accordingly, 
successful experiments must be given far greater weight than failures, 
where so many possibiHties of detrimental influences, aside from the 
diet itself, are liable to arise over prolonged periods of observation. 
Some of the uncertainties have been eliminated by the experience 
previously gained. For example, the intercurrent diseases of our 
animals have been almost entirely excluded by the use of rats raised 
in the laboratory for this research. By the prompt elimination of 
diseased animals, by scrupulous attention to the conditions of the 
cages and feeding arrangements — in other words, by painstaking 
attention to hygienic factors — we have succeeded in maintaining a 
large number of animals in exceptionally good health, so that they 
have become the more suitable to permit of accurate conclusions 
regarding the effects of the diets studied. Furthermore, the age and 
hereditary factors in our animals are now known to us, so that another 
source of uncertainty has disappeared. 



EARUeR EXPElRmNCeS OF THE AUTHORS. 59 



EARUER EXPERIENCES O^ THE AUTHORS. 

As the result of the first year's experiments, it was found possible 
to maintain rats in health and apparent nutritive equilibrium over 
considerable periods of time on a mixture of isolated food-substances 
containing isolated proteins as the source of nitrogenous intake. For 
example, one protocol (Chart XXX) shows that a full-grown rat* 
was maintained satisfactorily in this way for more than 2 1 7 days on 
glutenin, the animal continuing on this regime at the time when the 
earlier report was prepared for publication. Rats were hkewise main- 
tained on diets in which other proteins, notably casein alone or in 
combination with isolated vegetable proteins, formed the sole nitrog- 
enous food component, over periods of time exceeding any previously 
reported, at least under conditions in which the "purity" of the 
dietary substances was carefully maintained unchanged over equally 
long periods of time. By maintenance we do not merely mean that 
the animals remain alive. No feeding experiment is to be regarded as 
successful in fulfilling the nutritive requirements unless the animals 
approximately maintain their weight and health (or make normal 
growth if they are at a stage where this is still to be expected) . 

Although these apparently successful experiments indicated that 
the combinations of isolated food-stuffs employed satisfied the nutri- 
tive requirements of the rats and consequently constituted a com- 
plete food for the maintenance of mature animals, a prolongation of 
the observations has led to a less favorable outcome. A continuation 
of the experiments over longer periods has shown that in every case, 
sooner or later, the animal declined ; and unless a change in the diet 
was now instituted within a comparatively short time the animals 
died. The Charts XIV, XV, XVI in our earlier paper illustrate this 
very well. The rats 23, 24, 25 were maintained without noteworthy 
alterations in weight over 130 to 160 days on a constant mixture 
including a single protein. The animals ate well, as the food records 
show, until the final period of decline. 

These records can be duplicated, especially in respect to the de- 
cline, by many others, as for example Charts XLI, XI^II, I^XXVIII, 
LXXIX, I.XXX, CII, CXV, CXVI appended to this report. The 
history of rat 71 is particularly instructive on this point. f This 
animal (see Chart XXX), weighing 257 grams on April 5, 19 10, 
was put upon a diet containing casein (12 per cent) and glutenin 
(6 per cent) as the only proteins. Subsequently glutenin alone 
(16.4 per cent after 69 days and 18 per cent after 104 days) formed 
the protein of the diet. The rat continued in excellent nutritive

condition, eating well and exhibiting favorable nitrogen balances, 
until the end of 9I months, when a gradual decline was observed. 
When the animal, at the end of a total feeding period of 335 days 
(42 days after the onset of the decline) was reduced to 162.5 grams 
in weight and near death, an attempt was made to see whether 
the decline was due solely to improper food or to the onset of old 
age or disease. With mixed food realimentation took place at once 
and the rat regained its weight in a week. A resumption of the 
former glutenin food during 35 days gradually led to a second decline, 
which was promptly checked by a change in the diet involving only 
the non-protein components of the food mixture. Here, then, is a 
record of the feeding of a full-grown rat, with the exception of 7 days, 
during a period of 454 days on a diet of isolated food-stuffs and on a 
diet containing a single protein, glutenin, for 371 days. This obser- 
vation is remarkable because of the exceptional duration of the 
experiment. It is apparent, therefore, that as a maintenance diet our 
food lacked something other than protein and energy. 

It remains to be shown precisely what the lacking component 
of our earlier diets is, whether some organic constituent or a peculiar 
proportion of inorganic ingredients. In any event it is evident that 
our original artificial food mixtures are incapable of supporting life 
indefinitely. Aside from this, however, records like that of rat 71 
living on glutenin as the sole source of protein (see Chart XXX) , or 
rat 133 (Chart LXX) on edestin, in contrast with rats xi, xiv, 146, 
and 157 (Charts CXXVI, CXXVII, CXXVIII, and CXXIX) on 
zein indicate the possibility of nutritive inequalities among the 
proteins themselves. Marked deficiencies tend to manifest them- 
selves in comparativ-ely short periods of time. In all of these cases 
the food actually consumed supplied sufficient energy for the imme- 
diate needs of the rats under investigation. 

In the continuation of our experiments we have tried to profit 
by the first year's experiences. The methods have not been materially 
altered, except that the determination of the nitrogen balance has 
been omitted for the present. We learned from very numerous trials 
that it runs parallel with gain or loss of weight, and that the food 
intake varies closely with the weight of the animal, thereby making a 
record of the nitrogen unnecessary for judging the nutritive status of 
the rats employed. The same cages as heretofore have continued to 
prove very satisfactory. Instead of being rested on glass funnels for 
the collection of urine, they are now placed over a frequently changed 
sheet of absorbent paper (paper napkin) upon an enameled tray or 
pan. The fluid excreta thus promptly absorbed are frequently 
removed. It has already been pointed out that the food mixtures, 
prepared in paste form to prevent scattering by the animals and 
make it possible to obtain accurate records of the quantities eaten,

are not ideal in composition. The inclusion of 20 to 45 per cent of 
fat in the diet — a condition necessitated by the requirements of the 
experiments as outlined — seems like an excessive amount ; neverthe- 
less the utilization appears to be satisfactory and attempts to devise 
less objectionable modes of feeding have been unsuccessful in our 
hands. 

ALIMENTARY BACTERIA AND NUTRITION. 

In the course of our later studies we have been forced to take 
cognizance of the possible role of the bacterial flora of the alimentary 
tract in relation to appropriate nutrition. The water-free, fat-rich 
food characteristic of our experimental dietaries is not, broadly 
speaking, a particularly favorable medium for the development of cer- 
tain groups of bacteria. The food of our animals therefore probably 
introduces into the digestive tube of the experimental animals bac- 
terial invaders somewhat different from those which normally inhabit 
the alimentary tract of rats living on a free mixed diet. It is quite 
conceivable, therefore, that the bacterial conditions may be altered 
markedly as a result of the restriction in the growth of certain groups 
or the facilitation of the development of still others in the alimentary 
tract under these changed and sustained conditions of altered diet.* 
It is well known, for example, that in higher animals the preponder- 
ance of acid-producing organisms — to use a single illustration — may 
lead to an inhibition of the growth of the putrefactive group. 

Guided by such considerations and the observation that those 
rats that have been maintained for long periods on diets with isolated 
food-stuffs become koprophagists, we have initiated the plan of feed- 
ing small quantities of the faeces of rats living on ordinary mixed food 
to some of our experimental animals, particularly in cases where 
symptoms of nutritive decHne had become manifest. In nearly every 
instance the occasional addition of a small amount of the faeces from a 
normally fed rat at once stopped the decline in weight of the experi- 
mental animals to which a single protein was being fed. The results 
in almost all of these cases have been sufficiently striking to warrant 
a further pursuit of this topic. In our experiments there appears to 
be an unmistakable favorable influence induced by the occasional 
addition to the dietary of normal faeces with their high bacterial 
content. It must not be overlooked that other components besides 
bacteria, notably inorganic salts and unknown compounds, are also 
furnished by this means; but the quantities involved have always 
been very small. Further investigation will be necessary and is 
already projected. 

The procedure in the case of these faeces-feeding trials consisted 
in introducing small amounts (about 0.5 gm.) of air-dry excrement

62 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD-SUBSTANCES. 

of rats on mixed food into the cages twice a week. It is an interesting 
observation that when the rats kept on a mixture of isolated food- 
substances were offered a choice between their own faeces and those 
of rats on mixed diets, they invariably chose the faeces of the latter. 
In many cases we have noticed a marked improvement in the nutri- 
tive conditions of animals maintained on a single-protein dietary 
when other rats were introduced into their cages for breeding pur- 
poses. In view of the favorable influence exerted by feeding the 
faeces of rats living on mixed food, it is quite likely that the presence of 
the strangers in the cages furnished a suitable opportunity to obtain 
"normal" faeces. This may explain the favorable results noted, in 
contrast with the negative effects seen where several rats living on 
the same single-protein diet have been maintained in the same cage. 

The extent of the influence exerted by what we have, in the 
absence of a better explanation, assumed to be bacterial influences, is 
illustrated in some of the appended charts, the periods at which the 
faeces feeding was begun being indicated. The favorable effects have 
not been confined to experiments with one protein, but are mani- 
fested with casein (see Charts XXXIX, XI., XI^I. and XLII), with 
edestin (see Charts LXVI, I.XVII, LXVIII, and I.XIX), and with 
gliadin (see Charts CI, CII, and CIII) . Two failures may likewise be 
recorded, viz, an ultimate one with casein (Chart XLI) and a com- 
plete one with edestin (Chart lyXXVII) as the protein component. 
These were not due to incapacity of the animals to grow, since fur- 
ther alteration of diet brought marked improvement. 

The influence of faeces feeding is especially striking in the case of 
the gliadin tests, since without the addition of the faeces it has been 
almost impossible to attain satisfactory nutritive condition with this 
protein plus the special non-protein components of the food here 
employed. It is instructive therefore to compare such failures (cf. 
Period 2, Charts CXV and CXVI) with Charts CI and CIII,in which 
faeces feeding was resorted to. 

In four of the experiments with edestin-food alluded to and re- 
corded on Charts LXVI, I^XVII, LXVIII, and I.XIX, fresh faeces 
were not actually introduced into the cages ; but the improvement, 
and even growth, in these young rats is coincident with the oppor- 
tunity afforded to obtain "normal" faeces when other rats were daily 
introduced into the cages for a few hours. 

In Chart CII is seen the result of an attempt to determine 
whether the favorable influence of the faeces is actually of bacterial 
nature. Faeces were fed as in the comparable gliadin experiments 
(Charts CI and CIII) ; but they were previously sterilized by thrice 
repeated heating in an atmosphere of steam. The decline of the 
animal was not prevented to the same extent with sterilized as with 
normal faeces. Further trials are necessary in this direction; and our

experience, though Hmited, invites attention anew to the possible 
nutritive functions of bacteria in the aHmentary tract. Some of the 
aspects of this problem are referred to in our earlier paper.* 

NUTRITION AND GROWTH. 

The criteria of adequate nutrition are quite different in the case 
of growing animals from those applying to adults of the same species. 
During the period of adolescence it is not sufficient to maintain a 
condition of nutritive equilibrium and constancy of form or body- 
weight. In this stage of an animal's existence there should be evi- 
dences of development, and growth should manifest itself in a change 
of size. The curve of growth, expressed in changes of body- weight, is 
remarkably constant and characteristic for each species under the 
ordinary conditions of nutrition and environment. The individual 
values may at times fluctuate about a mean ; but in the majority of 
cases the excursions from the average are not extensive. 

In Chart XXII are reproduced curves illustrating the average 
normal rate of growth of the white rat, both male and female. The 
statistics for two of the curves are taken from Donaldson,! whose 
observations we have repeatedly verified in their general features. 
A third curve on the same chart represents the results of our own 
observations on the growth of the female white rat, regarding which 
data are less abundant. It will be noted that the curves of growth 
for the two sexes do not completely coincide in type. After an age 
of 70 days, represented by a body- weight of about loo grams, the rate 
of growth is somewhat slower in the female than in the male. In- 
deed, the females rarely attain the large weight and size exhibited by 
the normal adult males of the same age, even in the case of animals 
from the same litter. We gain the impression that our ''breed" of 
rats may in general be somewhat smaller than those measured by 
Donaldson and his collaborators. At any rate, the data available 
for statistical purposes are not very extensive and the curves here 
presented must have only a provisional value until more numerous 
measurements are made. In connection with certain of our experi- 
ments it may be stated that "the effect of mating on the growth- 
curve for the males can probably be neglected. "J In the case of 
females, the effect of the bearing of young is, according to Watson, § 
**to render the mated rats slightly heavier than the unmated — some 
of the excessive weight being due to the larger amount of fat present 
in the mated animals." Two charts (XXIV, XXV) are appended

to illustrate the influence of the course of pregnancy on the growth- 
curve of female rats of different sizes. 

Making allowance for these minor divergencies, the striking 
uniformity in the progress of development in an animal nevertheless 
is a specific racial characteristic, and gives to the curve of growth a 
unique value as an index of the conditions which determine it. 
Growth is affected by two factors : nutrition, and what Rubner has 
termed " Wachstumstrieb " or growth-impulse. The latter factor is 
inherent in the animal. The limits are determined by heredity and 
can not be altered materially by the most abundant diet. " Eine noch 
so reichliche Ernahrung vermag die in derRasse und derenVererbung 
gelegenen Grossen- und Massenbegrenzungen nicht zu mehren."* 

We are not prepared, at this time, to discuss the nature of the 
hereditary factor or impelling ' ' force ' ' in growth. f Aron writes : 

Die Natur des Wachstumstriebes ist dunkel. Sie ist eine Funktion der 
Zellen, im besonderen der jugendlichen Zellen. Welche Faktoren diesen 
Zelltrieb regiilieren, wissen wir nicht, vor allem nicht, warum er allmahlich 
aufhort. Ob hier die Zeitdauer seiner Wirksamkeit, ob die erreichte Grosse 
des Individuums den Ausschlag fiir das Abklingen des Wachstumstriebes 
gibt, ist bis jetzt nicht entschieden.| 

Rubner has attempted to formulate its character: 

Die eine grosse Unbekannte auf dem Gebiete der Wachstumsphysiologie 
ist der Wachstumstrieb, der in gesetzmassiger Weise den Gang der Entwick- 
lung, Massenzunahme, durch die Regelung der Ernahrung leitet. Den 
Urgrund hat dieser Wachstumstrieb in der Geschwindigkeit der Kernteilung ; 
wie wir noch sehen werden leitet sich hieraus der ganze Prozess des Stoff- 
umsatzes ab. Die Kernteilungsgeschwindigkeit ist offenbar etwas der 
Spezies Eigentiimliches, somit sind wir nicht in der Lage, vorlaufig tiefer in 
dieses Problem vorzudringen.g 

The second factor ingrowth, namely, nutrition, can be approached 
more easily by the experimental method. It is along this line that 
we have hoped, therefore, to be able to attack some of the problems 
of the relative value of the individual foodstuffs. It is well known 
that growth can be retarded by means involving the nutrition of 
the individual. Waters has well summarized the situation in these 
words : 

The upper limit of the size of an animal is determined by heredity. The 
stature to which an animal may actually attain, within this definitely fixed 
limit, is directly related to the way in which it is nourished during its grow- 
ing period. Some of our approved theories have been so extreme as to hold, 
in effect, that the animal must grow at its maximum rate practically every

day from birth to complete maturity in order to reach its normal size, or 
the full stature fixed by heredity. In other words, it is assumed that the 
animal has but one way of reaching its full stature and full development, 
viz. , by developing to its upper limit through its entire growth period. This 
assumes that the organism is utterly incapable of compensating for any 
retarded development at any time in its growth period, either by a subse- 
quently increased rate of growth, or by extending, even in the slightest 
degree^ the growth cycle, much less by growing for a time at least when so 
sparsely fed that no gain in weight occurs.* 

Rubner has expressed the role of nutrition in growth as follows : 

Kanndie Ernahrung auch keinen Wachstumstrieb schaffen, so kann sie, 
wenn ungiinstig und unzweckmassig, doch zu einem Hemmnis des natur- 
lichen Wachstums werden. Wachstumsbehinderung ist innerhalb gewisser 
Grenzen noch keine Ursache einer Existenzgefahrdung, ein Kind, dem die 
Nahrung normales Wachstum hindert, stirbt deswegen durchaus nicht, es 
holt spater leicht wieder ein, was es versaumt hat . . . Nur das steht 
sicher, dass die Behinderung des Wachstumstriebes, wie dies wirklich 
vorkommt, nicht wahrend der ganzen Wachstumsperiode andauern darf, 
da sonst allerdings die Grosse des Individuums dauernd Schaden leidet. 
Verlorene Korpcrgrosse in der Jugendzeit kann nach VoUendung der 
Wachstumsperiode nimmermehr abgeglichen werden . . . Eine optimale 
Ernahrung, wie die W achstitms ernahrung sein muss, stellt an die richtige 
Auswahl der Stoffe ganz andere Anforderungen als eine einfache 
Erhaltungsdiat.f 

Obviously the energy problem plays an important part in the 
nutrition of growing animals. For the present we are primarily 
concerned with the qualitative aspects of the diet rather than the 
quantitative features of the food-intake. These two factors may at 
times stand in intimate relation to each other; improperly consti- 
tuted food may, for example, modify the amoimt eaten and therefore 
the energy available for growth. As was intimated in our first 
report we have been able to arrest development in rats by feeding 
mixtures containing a single protein; but inasmuch as the food 
intake was not measured at that time, it was impossible to say 
whether the chemical character of the diet or a quantitatively inade- 
quate food consumption was responsible for the dwarfing. The fact 
brought out was that in these young animals there could be a main- 
tenance oj weight, precisely as in older rats. 

Waters has appropriately emphasized the necessity of a more 
exact definition of what is meant by maintenance , in contrast with 
growth. He writes: 

It has long been assumed that the body of an animal, when supplied 
with only sufficient nutriment to maintain its weight, remains constant in 
composition and that no growth or production or change of any sort occurs.

ings Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science, 1908, xxix, p. 3.

66 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD-SUBSTANCES. 

It is true that the term maintenance has been used somewhat loosely, but 
in general we have been in the habit of regarding the animal in maintenance 
when its live weight was constant. A more correct definition of the term 
would perhaps be to say that the animal was in maintenance when its body 
was in energy balance, but the live weight has been the conventional 
measure of our maintenance values.* 

It is generally admitted that the proteins satisfy several functions 
in a growing organism as well as in the adult. The first is that of 
maintenance, corresponding with what has been termed the " Abnut- 
zungsquote, " or wear-and-tear, by Rubner. This makes good the 
inevitable losses occasioned by the processes of metabolism, cellular 
and secretory processes, etc. It is a small yet ever present need 
for protein (as well as energy), representing in a general way the 
minimal protein need of the stationary organism. Any excess of 
protein beyond this maintenance requirement may, in the adult, 
experience temporary storage ('' Ansatz") or be devoted to dynamo- 
genie purposes ; but in the organism capable of development it con- 
tributes a share toward growth. It should be emphasized that the 
rate of growth is not by any means proportional to the excess of 
protein available. It is surprising, indeed, how small a content of 
protein in the dietary suffices to make growth possible. Rubner and 
Heubnerj found, for example, that in suckling infants a protein 
intake equivalent to 5 per cent of the total calories satisfies the protein 
needs of maintenance, while 7 per cent permits of growth. Rubner 
writes : 

Das Wachstum ist eine Funktion der Zelle, es kann durch unzureich- 
ender Eiweisszufuhr latent werden, aber Eiweiss vermag nicht die Wach- 
stumsschnelligkeit iiber die von der Natur gestreckten Grenzen zu heben, 
daher wird mit steigender Eiweissmenge in der Kost prozentisch weniger 
verwertet und das iiberflussig zugefiihrte Eiweiss wird einfach als Brennstoff 
verbraucht der isodyname Mengen N-freier Stoffe einspart. Diese starke 
Anziehung von Eiweiss zum Wachstum nimmt im Laufe der Entwicklung 
ab und ist am grossten in der ersten Zeit des Lebens.t 

Waters has found in his extensive studies on cattle that growth, 
in the sense of changes of size and form, may occur even under 
adverse nutritive conditions. Fundamentally such investigations 
touch upon the much controverted question as to the relative impor- 
tance of breeding and feeding in determining the shape and activities 
of mature animals. It is well known that by limiting the food supply 
of an ungrown individual, its development may be retarded. If the 
underfeeding is prolonged through the cycle of growth, the full 
stature limited by heredity may not be reached.

NUTRITION AND GROWTH. 67 

Waters asked the question : 

Will this animal of smaller stature be in the same proportion with re- 
spect to all the organs and the different parts of its body as though it had 
been nourished to its full capacity and had attained its normal size and max- 
imum development ? Or will in this period of sparse nourishment a more 
complete development occur in certain parts of the body than in other parts? 
In short, when there is not sufficient food supplied to the growing animal 
to develop all of the organs and all parts of the body to their full limit and 
extent, will the rate of development of certain of these organs or parts 
diminish earlier than others and will the development of certain parts cease 
altogether before the development of other parts is diminished in rate and 
is it possible that some parts may cease their development before that of 
other parts?* 

In actual experiments at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment 
Station, Waters found that ungrown cattle may remain at a constant 
body- weight for a long period of time, and yet increase in height and 
apparently decrease their store of fat. In other words, the skeleton 
has grown, or at least the bones have lengthened. Two interesting 
illustrative protocolsf are reprinted here, one. Table XXXI, in which 
a stationary body-weight was maintained, the other, Table XXXII, 
in which there was actual decline on a starvation ration.

The following is from Waters, in regard to a series of compara- 
ble cattle maintained by him on different nutritive planes, desig- 
nated as sub-maintenance, maintenance, and super-maintenance: 

It is to be observed that there is no appreciable difference in the rate of 
growth in height of these three animals on widely different nutritive planes, 
from the beginning of the experiment (February) to the end of June. At 
this time the curve of the sub-maintenance animal flattens perceptibly. A 
month later, the maintenance animal is apparently responding to the in- 
fluence of the low nutritive plane. As would be expected, in the case of 
the super-maintenance animal, the rate of growth remains unchanged. 
It may be surprising to many [Waters writes elsewhere] that an animal 
on maintenance, much less on sub-maintenance, should show any increase 
whatever in the width of hip or length of leg . . . Apparently the animal 
organism is capable of drawing upon its reserve for the purposes of sustain- 
ing the growth process for a considerable time and to a considerable extent. 
Our experiments indicate that after the reserve is drawn upon to a con- 
siderable extent to support growth the process ceases, and there is no further 
increase in height or in length of bone. From this point on the animal's 
chief business is to be to sustain life. This law applies to animals on a 
stationary live weight as well as those being fed so that the live weight is 
steadily declining, and indeed to those whose ration, while above main- 
tenance and causing a gain in live weight, is less than the normal growth 
rate of the individual. Such an animal will, while gaining in weight, be- 
come thinner, because it is drawing upon its reserve to supplement the

More recently Aronf has made comparable studies on growing 
dogs. He formulated his problem in the following words:

ungsbedarf des wachsenden Organismus zu befriedigen, aber kein Ueber- 
schuss, der als Wachstumsenergie dienen konnte? Die nachstliegende 
Annahme ist, dass dann kein Wachstum stattfindet, dass der Wachstums- 
prozess stillsteht. Konnen wir nun wirklich den Wachstumstrieb durch 
Nahrungsbeschrankung unterdriicken ? Wie lange? Und was geschieht 
spater mit einem wachsenden Organismus, dessen Wachstum eine Zeitlang 
hintan gehalten worden ist? (p. 208.) 

Aron succeeded by restricted feeding in attaining constancy of 
body-weight in practically all of his dogs, in some cases during a 
period of nearly a year. The daily gains or losses fluctuated within 
a few grams. The description of the animals during the experiments 
is of interest to us : 

Bei alien Hunden konnte man deutlich beobachten, wie die Tiere trotz 
des Gewichtsstillstands wuchsen, d.h. an Hohe und Lange zunahmen. 
Dabei wurden die Tiere zusehends magerer, Fett und Muskeln schienen an 
Masse abzunehmen, die runden Formen schwanden, die Knochen traten 
eckig unter der Haut hervor, und schliesslich schienen die Tiere nur noch 
aus Haut und Knochen zu bestehen. Trotzdem waren die Hunde nicht 
etwa schwach. Im Gegenteil, sie waren lebhaft, liefen und sprangen umher, 
oft mehr als ihre normalen Brudertiere, die ein zwei- oder dreimal zo grosses 
Korpergewicht zu bewaltigen hatten. Dieser Zustand zunehmender 
Abmagerung unter standiger Grossen-, d.h. Langen- und Hohenzunahme 
bei Konstantbleiben des Gewichtes dauerte je nach dem Grade derNahrungs- 
entziehung [ungefahr 3 bis 5 Monate an. Wurde jetzt, wenn das Tier 
vollig abgemagert war, . . . , die Nahrungsmenge weiter so gering belassen 
wie vorher, so ging das Tier unter geringem Gewichtsverlust in volliger 
Inanition zugrunde. Wurde aber jetzt die Nahrungsmenge etwas erhoht, 
wie bei Hund A, so hielt sich das Tier zwar voUkommen abgemagert, aber 
auf konstantem Gewicht. Und jetzt erweist sich dieser Gewichtsstillstand als 
identisch mit Wachstums still stand! Der Hund A ist noch weitere 5 Monate 
auf dem gleichen Gewicht gehalten worden, ohne dass sich nun in seinem 
Aussehen nennenswerte Aenderungen konstatieren liessen. 

Durch geeignete Nahrungsbeschrankung gelingt es also, wachsende 
Hunde beliebig lange auf konstantem Gewicht zu halten. Natiirligh darf 
man nicht allzu junge Tiere nehmen. Wahrend dieses Gewichtsstillstandes 
gehen aber gewaltige Umwandlungen im Tierkorper vor, die sich ausserlich 
in dem fortschreitenden Langen- und Hohenwachstum und der Abmagerung 
dokumentieren. 

Off enbar ist trotz des Gewichtsstillstandes das Skelett "weiter gewachsen 
und hat nicht nur an Grosse, sondern auch an Masse zugenommen. Folg- 
lich miissen andere Korpergebilde (wie Haut, Fleisch, Organe usw.) 
an Gewicht verloren haben; denn sonst konnte ja das Gewicht des Tieres 
nicht das gleiche geblieben sein. Ebenso wie die Massenverhaltnisse der 
einzelnen Korpergebilde haben sich nun hochstwahrscheinlich auch die 
Mengenverhaltnisse der einzelnen Korperbestandteile, wie Fett, Eiweiss 
usw., betrachtlich verschoben. (p. 212.) 

Aron's analyses of the underfed dogs showing stationary weight 
in comparison with well-fed control animals indicate that in addi- 
tion to the bones, the brain also was protected from loss of weight, 
while the adipose and muscular tissue suffered notable losses. Most 
striking is the degree to which water has replaced the tissue substance

becoming distinctly "watery," as the selected protocol shows:*

It is apparent here, as in Waters' s experiments, that the energy 
deficit has been furnished by the body. "Sind alle verfiigbaren 
Reservestoffe aufgebraucht, dann gewinnt der Erhaltungstrieb die 
Oberhand iiber den Wachstumstrieb, und das 'Wachstum' stockt. " 
(Aron, p. 222.) 

In relation to our own later observations it is desirable to quote 
Aron's view regarding the impulse to growth. He concludes: 

. . . dass die innere treibende Kraft zum Wachsen iiberhaupt in dem 
Kerngeriist des Korpers, dem Skelett, ruht. Die Muskulatur verfiigt 
anscheinend iiber gar keinen richtigen Wachstumstrieb. Sie folgt dem 
wachsenden Skelett nur dann, wenn die Ernahrungsverhaltnisse es erlauben, 
vielleicht auf Grund rein mechanischer Krafte (Zug). 

Recht interessant scheint zum Schluss noch die Frage, wie sich bei den 
durch lange fortgesetzte Unterernahrung im Wachstum zuriickgehaltenen 
Tier en die Entwicklung und die Entwicklungsfahigkeit verhait. Mein 
Tiermaterial war nicht ausreichend, um ein Studium der Geschlechtsorgane 
der zwar im Alter der Geschlechtsreife stehenden, aber im Wachstum weit 
zuriickgebliebenen Tiere zu gestatten. Dagegen scheint mir die Beobach- 
tung der Stimme auf ein wirkliches Zuriickbleiben der Entwicklung auf dem 
infantilen Stadium zu deuten. Die Unterschiede zwischen den Bruder- 
tieren der ersten, zweiten und vierten Versuchsreihe waren auffallig. Die 
im Gewicht zuriickgebliebenen Tiere schrien kreischend wie junge Hunde, 
wahrend ihre normalen Brudertiere mit tiefem Tonfall bellten. In ganz 
dem gleichen Sinne spricht die von Waters festgestellte Tatsache, dass seine 
in Gewicht und Wachstum zuriickgebliebenen Tiere ein Fleisch, das fiir 
'Kalbfleisch' charakteristisch war, aufwiesen, wahrend sie dem Alter nach 
schon "Rindfleisch" besitzen sollten. (pp. 222-223.) 

Studies of the relation of weight to the measurements of children 
during the first yearf have also given evidence of "disproportionate" 
growth in the case of poorly nourished infants. Whereas there is, in 
the normal infant, a fairly constant relationship between body- 
weight and height, circumference of head, chest, etc., this is not true 
where proper increase of body- weight is retarded by poor nutrition. 
For example, in children whose weight at the end of the third month

SUvSPKNSION OF GROWTH ON A MAINTENANCE DIET. 7 1 

is only equal to that of a normal child at birth, the height has been 
found above that of the latter, illustrating, as Fleischner remarks, 
"that age plays some part in the growth of the infant, independent 
of the weight." This corresponds with the cases of the animals 
already cited. Fleischner concludes from his measurements of 500 
children of whom 25 per cent were well nourished, 35 per cent fairly 
well nourished, and 40 per cent poorly nourished : 

It is in the poorly nourished children that age plays its most important 
part ... In the poorly nourished children, most of whom are probably 
somewhat premature, when the weight is below normal, all the measure- 
ments are correspondingly below normal. The height and circumference of 
the head reach the normal birth measurements a little ahead of the weight, 
while the chest and abdomen are two months later in reaching the measure- 
ments of a normal child at birth. When the weight is stationary the in- 
crease in the measurements is very small, depending upon the slight in- 
fluence which age has upon the growth of the infant notwithstanding the 
weight. The measurements of infants of the same weight, notwithstanding 
the age, are very similar, the small difference depending, as when the weight 
of a child is stationary, upon the very slight influence of age upon growth. 
The final conclusion can be drawn that during the first year of life the 
primary factor in the increase of the measurements of the body is steady, 
consistent increase in the weight, the influence of age being secondary and 
much less important.* 

SUSPENSION OF GROWTH ON A MAINTENANCE DIET. 

Early in the course of our investigation we noted that young 
rats could remain in apparent good health while living on some of 
the mixtures of isolated food-stuffs, without giving any evidence of 
growth. In some instances the animals ultimately declined and 
died where the diet was not changed ; but in numerous cases body- 
weight, which we used as our guide, remained practically unchanged 
or showed a minimal slow increase (cf. Charts XXXVII, LXIII, 
and LXIV). The experiment showing the greatest growth under 
these dietary conditions is recorded in Chart XXXVIII. Other 
investigators have met with this stationary condition and accepted 
it as evidence of satisfactory nutritive equilibrium. We soon became 
convinced, however, that a diet which will not induce real growth 
at the proper age is unquestionably defective from the standpoint of 
perfect nutrition. Furthermore, inasmuch as the ungrown rat has a 
far smaller reserve of available energy and manifests the utilization 
of a suitable diet both speedily and conspicuously by its measurable 
changes in size, the animal becomes an exceptionally appropriate 
subject at this early stage for the study of the nutritive requirement. 

The most precise evidence which we can present at this time of 
the stationary condition of the animals which we have stunted by

three young rats of the same Utter maintained for 124 days without 

noteworthy growth, on a diet of

The curves of growth of these animals as well as three others 
from the same brood fed on mixed food or the milk-food mixture 
(and showing a normal growth) are reproduced in Charts LXXXI, 
LXXXII, LXXXIII, IvXXXIV, LXXXV, and I.XXXVI. 

The animals were killed at the age of 178 days and measurements 
were made by Dr. S. Hatai, of the Wistar Institute. The tabulated 
data are given on the following page, together with a report from Dr. 
Hatai, to whom, as well as to Dr. Donaldson, we are greatly indebted 
for helpful cooperation. 

The statistics of body-length, weight of brain, spinal cord, etc., 
of the stunted animals at an age of 178 days are comparable with 
those characteristic for normally growing rats of the same body- 
weight, which is attained at an age of approximately 54 to 63 days. 
Here, then, are illustrations of maintenance without growth. 

Dr. Hatai further reports as follows : 

Since it seems to be|the least variable character, I have selected the body- 
length as the basis for computation. When the other characters which we 
can measure are calculated from the formulas based on body-length, it is 
seen that the observed weight of the brain and of the spinal cord agrees 
closely with the calculated in both the control and the stunted rats. Thus 
both series have a growth of the nervous system normal to their body- 
length. In the control series, the percentage of water observed in both the 
brain and the spinal cord agrees with that calculated according to the body- 
length. In general then the control rats agree with the general population 
in these characters. Since the stunted rats have an abnormally small body- 
length for their age, they can not be treated by the formula for determining 
the percentage of water from body-length. When, however, we take the 
estimated percentage of water for 178 days (see Donaldson*) we find that 
this value agrees with that observed in the stunted series. It m^ay be 
further noted that the ratio between body-length and tail-length is the same 
in both series. We therefore conclude that w both series the body-weight is 
normal to the body-length; the brain and spinal cord weight normal to the body- 
length; and the percentage of water normal for age. Concerning other organs 
we have no data, but we may infer from the foregoing that they also have 
weights normal to the body-length. You will see from the above that the 
stunted rats though small have the general relative development of the 
controls and that in the only case where it is possible to follow the maturing 
process, that is in the percentage of water in the nervous system, they have 
matured in accordance with their age (see Donaldson*).

Photographs of other rats which have been dwarfed in hke ways 
give evidence of the similarity of the stunts in general appearance 
with normal animals of the same weight at a much earlier age. Thus, 
in Plate i , rat 305, C, weighing 5 5 grams at the age of 36 days, compares 
favorably with rat 240, B, dwarfed on a gliadin food mixture, at the 
age of 140 days, when it weighed 55 grams (cf. Chart CXIII). It is 
interesting to contrast B with the uppermost photograph A of rat 
238, likewise 140 days old and from the same brood but weighing 
146 grams, the normal weight for this age. Each was raised under 



74 F^HDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED I^OOD-SUBSTANCES. 

identical conditions from the age of 38 days, except that rat 238 
(see Chart LVI) was fed with a paste containing casein and pro- 
tein-free milk, while in the food of 240 (see Chart CXIII) the casein 
was replaced by gliadin. 

Plate 2 shows rat 220, E, fed on gliadin and protein-free milk 
but weighing only 58 grams, although 148 days old, and, for con- 
trast, rat 168, D, of approximately the size normal for the age of 
rat 220, is also shown. Figure F shows a normally nourished rat of 
the same weight as rat 220. This picture is introduced to show that 
rat 220 has the appearance of a normal rat of corresponding size and 
weight. All these pictures were taken on exactly the same scale and 
afford a ready comparison of the relative sizes of the animals. 

The interesting photographs of underfed cattle published by 
Waters, on the contrary, make the change of form in his under- 
nourished animals of stationary weight quite apparent. We are, 
however, not prepared to assert that careful measurements of our 
stunted rats will not disclose some trace of similar changes in skeletal 
form. They must be slight at most; for we have often compared 
animals long maintained at small stature with properly grown animals 
which have just reached the same weight, without detecting any devi- 
ation from the youthful form in so far as one could judge by mere 
visual inspection. The photographs speak in the same sense. 

The point on which we lay great stress in the foregoing experi- 
ments is the fact that the stunting is not attributable primarily to 
under-feeding. Our dwarfed rats have as a rule eaten as adequately 
as normally nourished animals oj the same size. The energy factor, as 
such, thus drops out of the problem. In this respect the experiments 
are not comparable with those of Waters and of Aron, both of whom 
accomplished their results by underfeeding with adequate food mate- 
rials . In our experiments the ' ' energy requirement for maintenance' ' 
and the ''energy requirement for growth," which together are essen- 
tial to the developing organism, were both supplied. The rats did not 
grow primarily at the expense of stored tissue materials : they failed 
to grow in any sense. We are obviously dealing with some other feature 
than insufficient energy supply. The numerous illustrative experi- 
ments which will be cited later are accordingly to be interpreted as 
instances of maintenance without growth. If it is true that growth 
can only continue when the energy intake exceeds the mere main- 
tenance requirement, it is equally true that an excess of calories does 
not per se insure growth in a suitable animal. Here then is the 
opportunity to ascertain and differentiate some of the essential qual- 
itative factors: protein, inorganic salts, etc. — their minimum and 
optimum values. 



EFFECT OF STUNTING ON THE GROWTH IMPULSE. 



75 



EFFECT OF STUNTING ON THE GROWTH IMPULSE. 

Before proceeding to study the influence of dietary variations on 
(a) maintenance and (b) growth, respectively, it became necessary to 
learn whether a more or less temporary inhibition of growth checks 
or in any degree modifies the capacity to grow ( Wachstumstrieb) . 
The literature on this subject by no means reveals a unanimity of 
opinion, although familiar experience will bring to mind many illus- 
trations of compensated retardation of growth in children.* A few 
typical experiments may be cited. Rat 36 (male) kept stunted 49 
days on a diet of gliadin foodf (37 days) followed by casein food mix- 
turef (12 days), showed complete recovery of growth on a mixed diet 
(see Chart XCVI). The "mixed diet of our animals consists of dog 
biscuit, sunflower seed, and fresh carrots (with occasional changes 
and addition of lumps of rock salt). Rat 65 (female) stunted, during 
33 days on a diet of casein-zein food, {likewise resumed a normal rate of 
growth as soon as the mixed diet was instituted (see Chart XXXVII). 

Special interest is attached to experiments in which after a pre- 
liminary stunting period the resumption of growth was accomplished 
on a diet containing milk as the effective component. Two protocols 
of the diet during the stunting period are reproduced in Table 
XXXV, with reference hkewise to Charts XXVIII and XXIX.

The curves in these cases are seen to be quite comparable with 
those of the normally growing rats . B earing in mind that the animals 
here studied were continually kept in small cages under actual experi- 
mental conditions, the ''normal" character of the growth curves 
makes it evident that the environment is no wise detrimental.

76 FEEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD-SUBSTANCES. 

Normal growth, as judged by curve of increase in body- weight, 
was resumed on a diet consisting of 

per cent. 

"Trumilk" 60.0 

Starch 16.7 

Lard 23.3 

Similar experiences are shown after feeding gliadin (Charts 
XCIX, C) or edestin (Chart LXV). 

In the case of rat 37 (Chart XCVII), a stunting period of 49 
days on a diet of gliadin food for 37 days, followed by casein food mix- 
ture for 1 2 days, was followed by normal resumption of growth under 
a dietary regime in which a period of feeding on the above milk-food 
was alternated with mixed food. Judging by the typical character 
of the curve of growth in this animal the two types of resuscitation 
diet, though radically different in origin, are equally efficacious in 
promoting growth. The growth curve shows little deviation from its 
usual course incidental to the changes in the dietary. 

It may be remarked that the early stunting does not neces- 
sarily impair the capacity to breed at a later period when growth is 
again established. Furthermore, we have found that the milk-fat- 
starch mixture continued from early life in no wise impairs the 
potency of rats as breeders. Its nutritive efficiency will be referred 
to again. 

Experiments such as those recorded above give unmistakable 
evidence of the fact that a considerable period of stunting by no 
means impairs the * ' Wachstumstrieb " of these animals. As soon 
as an appropriate diet is instituted growth begins anew and proceeds 
with practically the same speed as under normal conditions. By this 
we mean that a definite increment of gain from some fixed weight 
requires approximately the same period for its accomplishment as in 
the case of uninterrupted growth. A rat which will ordinarily grow 
from 60 grams to 1 80 grams in body-weight in 60 days will make the 
same gain even when its growth has been inhibited days or even weeks 
and its size and form retained at a maintenance level. This will be 
apparent by comparing, for example, the normal growth curve for 
both male and female rats with that of the realimented rats, during 
the same period of time, in Charts CXXII and CXXIII. 

It should be emphasized that the situation is here quite differ- 
ent from that developed by Waters and Aron in the experiments 
on cattle and dogs . With their conditions of underfeeding the animals 
increase in size (height, etc.) while starving; and during the earlier 
period of such trials a poorly fed animal may actually gain in height 
as rapidly as a highly nourished one, fed to the limit of its appetite.* 



*Cf. Waters: The capacity of animals to grow under adverse conditions. Proceedings 
Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Science, 1908, xxix, p. 15. 



EFFECT OF PARTIAI^ STARVATION ON BODY-WEJIGHT. 77 

The duration of the period of growth of the undernourished animal 
depends upon the constitutional vigor of the individual and the store 
of fat which it has accumulated. Quoting Aron : " Dem Einschmelz- 
ungsprozess fallt neben dem Fettgewebe in erster lyinie die Musku- 
latur zum Opfer, wahrend die Organe ihm widerstehen, wohl weil 
sie lebenswichtiger sind." 

The results of realimentation in animals which show this "dis- 
proportionate" growth, i. e., growth of one part at the expense of 
another, are not yet satisfactorily ascertained. Waters believes that 
physiological compensation may result " by an increase in the rate of 
growth in a period of liberal feeding following a period of low nourish- 
ment and low gain. In other words, an animal that is below the 
normal in size at a given age, through poor nourishment, apparently 
has the capacity, when liberally fed, to compensate for this loss, in a 
measure at least, by an increased rate of gain." He also suggests the 
possibility that growth may be accomplished on a more economical 
basis — a view which we are not yet ready to accept. 

EFFECT OF PARTlAIv STARVATION ON BODY-WEIGHT. 

Hatai* has studied the effect of partial starvation followed by 
normal diet on the growth of white rats. The "partial starvation" 
consisted in feeding a diet that is practically devoid of protein, viz, 
starch and water, during 21 days to animals about 40 days old. The 
realimentation was continued to the age of maturity, at the end of 
200 days. The statistics thus obtained and reproduced in Table 
XXXVI are presented graphically in Chart XXVI.

Hatai concluded that, as far as body-weight is concerned, "the 
experimented rats have completely recovered from the effect of 21 
days of partial starvation . . . The recovery in the weight is 
most astonishing, especially during the first 3 or 4 days, within which 
time the starved rats regain the weight lost during the 21 days of 
starvation. Later the increase in weight is very steady, though not 
as rapid as during the first few days, until the rat has reached the age

of 1 50 days, and after this age increase in weight is relatively slow. 
What will happen to such rats during the later portions of the span of 
life has yet to be determined in order to answer the question whether 
this partial starvation in early life has any influence either on 
longevity or the onset of old age." (p. 314-315.) 

EFFECT OF PARTI AIv STARVATION ON NERVOUS SYSTEM. 

Though the period of retarded growth was eventually completely 
compensated in Hatai's animals, in so far as the weight of the body 
and central nervous system are concerned, the chemical composition 
of the brain and spinal cord was not entirely free from the effect. As 
the result of an extended investigation of the effects of underfeeding 
on the nervous system, Donaldson* has arrived at the conclusion that 
one of the characteristics of growth, the change in the water content 
of the brain, has not been arrested like the increase of the animal in 
size and body- weight, but apparently accelerated. He states: 

The underfed group are in this character similar to somewhat older ani- 
mals. Evidence further points to the continued formation of the medullary 
sheaths with advancing age even in rats which are underfed, i. e., underfeed- 
ing does not arrest medullation. Underfeeding which stops growth of the 
body and retards that of the nervous system does not modify the percentage 
of water in the spinal cord, while it does reduce it in the brain — the amount 
of this reduction being less in the cases where the underfeeding is less severe . f 

With respect to the possible psychological effects of such under- 
feeding and return to normal diet Donaldson says : 

So far as our tests show, such an experience does not modify the rat's 
ability to learn, for, by a series of experiments, it has been possible to deter- 
mine that such a rat can learn to get its food under complicated conditions 
just as well and as rapidly as a normal animal (Hayes). J 

The preceding facts as to resuscitated rats are recorded here — 
despite the fact that this temporary stunting was produced by under- 
feeding (rather than unsuitable feeding as in our experiments) — 
because they suggest that the real story of the condition of the 
animals may perhaps not be revealed by the external evidences of 
growth. It is not at all impossible that the rats which we have 
dwarfed for months may have experienced some continued subtle 
changes in the make-up of the nervous system despite the appear- 
ance of unchanged youth which they manifest. Measurements of 
size and weight alone may not suffice to disclose the real physio- 
logical status of the animal, especially in respect to the development 
of the nervous functions and structures, which are singularly pro-

tected even during starvation. This is seen to be true in the series 
of stunted animals fed on the glutenin mixture in our experiments 
(p. 72). There is a large field of investigation still open here with 
important bearings on the problems of retarded growth in man. 
According to Donaldson* "the progressive diminution of the per- 
centage of water in the central nervous system with advancing age 
is to be regarded as an index of fundamental chemical processes, 
which take place in the more stable constituents of the nerve cells. 
These processes are but little modified by changes in the environment 
and taken all together constitute a series of reactions which express 
not only the intensity of the growth process in the nervous system, 
but also the span of life characteristic for any given species." Pos- 
sibly, then, the further study of the nervous system in connection 
with our experiments may throw light on the phenomena of malnu- 
trition (which our stunting experiments primarily represent) as well 
as those of undernutrition or starvation. 

It may be well here to note that the experience of Donaldson f 
indicates the main features of human growth to be well represented 
in the albino rat. So good is the essential correspondence that there 
is every reason to continue the work on this form. The striking 
difference is that the rat grows some thirty times as rapidly as man. 

COMPARISON OF MII.K AND MIXED DIET. . 

The failure either to induce substantial growth in young rats or 
to satisfy completely the maintenance requirement of older animals 
during very long protracted periods on the mixtures of isolated food- 
stuffs thus far reported raises the question as to what constitutes an 
ideal nutriment for a rat. The suitability of mixed diet is beyond 
question. The favorable experiences with dried milk powder (some 
of which have been recorded on pages 75 and 76) early directed our 
attention to this product. Rats were not only resuscitated after 
nutritive decline and suitably maintained, but also grown from early 
age on pastes in which the milk powder (with lard and starch) con- 
stituted the mixture. The commercial brand ' ' Trumilk "J employed

The preparation apparently contains a small excess of iron over 
that found in cow's milk — probably as a contamination from the 
desiccating process used. It is obtainable in easily manipulated form 
and with the addition of a small amount of nitrogen-free lard and 
starch forms a food paste readily consumed by rats. These pastes

We have carried rats through the period of growth as well as 
pregnancy on this diet alone, from the time that they were removed 
from the mother (cf. Charts XXXI, XXXII, and XXXIII). 

As a further illustration of the excellent nutritive properties and 
physiologically appropriate "combination " of food ingredients in the 
milk food-mixture, illustrative charts are appended to show the re- 
covery of rats moribund after prolonged periods of malnutrition, with 
lack of inorganic salts in the dietary (Charts XXXIV and XXXV). 
Many similar illustrations might be reproduced, giving evidence of 
the perfect realimentation of rats by the use of the milk food (cf. 
Charts XXVIII, IvXV, XCIX, and C). 

Remembering that our earlier trials with casein, the chief protein 
ingredient of the milk powder, and with combinations of casein and 
other proteins were at best successful only in maintaining nutritive 
equilibrium — and that not indefinitely — and were never adequate 
for the manifestation of real growth, we directed our attention to the 
non-protein constituents of milk. After numerous failures to modify 
the inorganic and non-protein ingredients of our dietaries by altering 
the relation of proportions of the various ions as well as the character 
of the carbohydrates and fats, it occurred to us that the protein-free 
portion of the milk might give the clue to the successful feeding of pro- 
teins which did not appear to be the inefficient factors in our cases of 
malnutrition. Accordingly a product was prepared as follows: 

Perfectly fresh centrifugated milk, nearly free from fat, was pre- 
cipitated in lots of about 36 liters by diluting with 7 liters of distilled

water which contained 1.64 c.c. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. 
The flocculent precipitate of casein was strained out on cheesecloth 
and the very nearly clear solution was filtered through a pulp filter. 
The filtrate, which at the most was very slightly turbid from sus- 
pended fat, was tested carefully by the alternate addition of dilute 
alkali and acid to determine whether any more casein could be sepa- 
rated from it. The addition of alkali caused a slight precipitate 
which did not increase on adding more alkali or dissolve on the addi- 
tion of even relatively large amounts of alkali. This was presumably 
chiefly calcium phosphate. The addition of acid in no case caused 
any further precipitation. The filtered milk serum was then heated 
to boiling for a few minutes and filtered. The filtrate, which was in 
all cases water clear, was then neutralized to litmus with a dilute 
solution of sodium hydroxide and evaporated to dryness on a steam 
bath at a temperature of about 70°. The product thus obtained 
formed a friable, pale yellow mass which was easily reduced to a fine 
powder by grinding in a mill. Several grams of this powder were 
tested for protein by dissolving in about 30 c.c. of water containing 
a little hydrochloric acid and warming gently. The solution was then 
saturated with ammonium sulphate . The precipitate , which appeared 
to consist chiefly of calcium sulphate, was separated by centrifugation, 
dissolved in a little water, and potassium hydrate solution and copper 
sulphate added. The solution showed no evidence of the biuret 
reaction until it was saturated with potassium hydroxide and shaken 
with alcohol. It then separated into two layers, the upper alcoholic 
layer showing a slight but positive biuret reaction. Millon's reaction 
tried on portions of 2 or 3 grams of the substance did not give a posi- 
tive reaction. Nitrogen determinations in several lots of the protein- 
free milk powder thus made showed them to contain 0.66, 0.59, 0.60, 
0.72, 0.71, 0.67, 0.75 per cent of nitrogen. Munk* states that if the 
proteins of milk are precipitated by alcohol, or separated according to 
Hoppe-Seyler, from one-thirtieth to one-fifteenth of the protein 
remains dissolved. All the proteins can be precipitated only by 
tannin in the cold or by copper hydroxide on heating. He further 
states that cow's milk contains about one-sixteenth of its nitrogen in 
non-protein form. Since our protein-free milk powder was equal to^ 
50 per cent of the total solids of the milk, it should, if Munk's state- 
ments are correct, contain 0.48 per cent of non-protein nitrogen, thus 
leaving at the most only 0.28 per cent of protein nitrogen, equal to 
1.69 per cent of protein. Since 100 grams of the food mixture 
employed in our experiments contained 28.2 grams of protein-free 
milk powder, we can assume that at the most the food pastes thus 
made contained only 0.48 per cent of milk protein. The protein-free

milk powder thus produced as above described left about 14.5 per 
cent of inorganic matter on ignition. This includes not only the 
inorganic constituents of the milk, although by no means in the com- 
bination in which they occur in the mammary secretion, but also the 
inorganic salts which were formed by the addition of the hydrochloric 
acid used to precipitate the casein and also the sodium salts which 
resulted from neutralizing the milk serum with sodium hydroxide 
solution. 

EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOI.ATED PROTEINS AND ' ' PROTElN-i^REE " MII.K. 

The use of this product (which we shall designate as protein-free 
milk) as an adjuvant to isolated proteins to furnish the inorganic 
elements of the diet has succeeded beyond our expectation. When 
employed, for example, in combination with various proteins, in the 
proportion in which its ingredients occur in the complete milk food 
already used (see page 76), it induces normal growth. Added during 
the periods of nutritive decline to food mixtures which no longer 
suffice to maintain rats, recovery has manifested itself in practically 
every case. Where, as in the case of zein, gliadin, or hordein feeding, 
no advantage has been obtained by the use of the protein-free milk, 
it has become obvious that the protein per se is the defective food 
constituent. Thus at length we have found a method of controlling 
or furnishing some of the most essential non-protein factors in the 
diet, so that the value of the individual proteins can be investigated 
under much more favorable conditions than formerly. 

Numerous charts (see p. 103 fig.) present the graphic records 
of feeding experiments with casein, edestin,* glutenin,* glycinin,* 
gliadin,* hordein,* ovalbumin,! and lactalbumin,t showing appropri- 
ate growth, or maintenance, according to the age at which the animals 
were started on the use of the protein-free milk as the non-protein 
component in place of the earlier inorganic salt mixture. 

It might be objected, after superficial consideration of these re- 
sults, that the favorable outcome (especially for growth) is due to 
milk protein contaminating the ' ' protein-free milk ' ' component of the 
diet. Aside from the fact that the amount of possible contamination 
is at most small, evidence of the untenability of such a theory is 
available from several sources. In the first place, growth has not 
followed the use of all proteins when the protein-free milk was added 
to them.

The failures in group 11 lead to the conclusion that the proteins, 
gliadin and hordein, are inadequate for the functions of growth. We 
are presumably dealing with a chemical inadequacy rather than any 
toxicity and consequent lack of growth, judging by the fact that the 
gliadin and hordein rats are maintained in good, nutritive condition 
even in the absence of growth. Their body- weight is scarcely changed 
at all. Without the use of the protein-free milk or faeces-feeding 
gliadin rats have usually declined (Charts XCVIII, XCIX, and C) . 

A second reason why the success of these trials is not due to the 
presence of possible minute contaminations with milk protein is 
discoverable in Charts XIvIII, XI.IV, XI.V, XI.VIII, XI.IX, I., LI, 
CVIII, CIX, CX, and CXI. Here the addition of not inconsiderable 
portions (5 to 30 per cent) of the actual milk food to the earlier 
inefficient protein mixtures is incapable of bringing about growth in 
any degree equal to that at once initiated when the protein-free milk 
is added in relative abundance. 

Further evidence that a trace of milk proteins is not responsible 
for the growth of the rats fed with mixtures containing our protein- 
free milk powder is furnished by experiments in which successively 
larger quantities of the milk food are added to the gliadin food. Here 
we see that growth gradually increases with the larger additions of 
the milk food, although with even as much as 30 per cent in the food 
the rate of growth is much below normal. With additions of 5 or 
even 20 per cent of the milk food, the rate of growth is very slow, as 
shown by Charts CIV, CV, CVI, and CVII. That this result is to be 
attributed to the proteins introduced in the milk food and not to a 
combination of a small quantity of milk proteins together with a 
sufficient quantity of the inorganic or other constituents of the milk 
is shown by experiments now in progress in which the addition of the 
milk food to the gliadin and protein-free milk food is producing 
normal growth. In this mixture we have all of the constituents of 



84 I^EEDING EXPERIMENTS WITH ISOLATED FOOD-SUBSTANCES. 

the protein-free milk present in the same proportions as in our milk 
food, but less than one- third of the protein constituents of the milk. 
It is therefore evident that only a small proportion of the protein 
constituents of the milk are required to produce normal growth, and 
it may be assumed that the presence of a small quantity of milk 
proteins in our protein-free milk powder would manifest itself by at 
least some slight growth. 

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS AND THEIR BEARINGS. 

We have stated that by our plan a biological comparison of dif-, 
f erent proteins in respect to their role in growth can at length be 
made. Our work in this direction must be regarded as barely begun. 
Nevertheless it is of interest to speculate as to the indications already 
gained and the outlook for future work. A comparison of the two 
groups of proteins — those adequate and those inadequate for growth 
purposes — at once reveals the fact that the latter category comprises 
proteins (gliadin, hordein, zein) commonly spoken of as chemically 
"incomplete." They lack one or more of the amino-acid complexes 
which are obtainable from the so-called "complete " proteins. None 
of them furnish glycocoU or lysine, and zein in addition is devoid of 
tryptophane. By feeding relatively small quantities of proteins like 
casein with gliadin growth begins at once. Here we can determine 
the minimum of suitable protein to satisfy this growth requirement — 
a study already begun (cf. Charts CXX, CXXI, CXXII, and 
CXXIII). The addition of amino-acids to "complete," as it were, 
the inadequate proteins can now be studied amid controllable factors ; 
the biological role of hydrolyzed proteins and the significance of 
complete hydrolysis or digestion in nutrition can be examined anew. 

The experiences which have demonstrated the striking differ- 
ences in value of the individual proteins and the small proportion of 
casein which suffices to induce growth instead of standstill (cf . Charts 
CXX, CXI, CXXII, and CXXIII, for example) emphasize the impor- 
tance of the purity of the protein fed. We have devoted much labor 
and incurred a very considerable expense to obtain proteins in a form 
as uncontaminated as present methods will permit. The products 
used were as pure as one would expect them to be if employed for 
purposes of refined protein analysis. Had less perfect products been 
employed it is quite conceivable and indeed likely that the admix- 
tures would have sufficed to alter completely the outcome of many 
experiments. For example, gliadin is prepared free from glutenin 
only be very careful purification methods ; and although the nutritive 
properties of these two companion proteins are extremely unlike, as 
clearly indicated by our trials, a failure to effect a complete separa- 
tion of a little glutenin from gliadin would have been sufficient to 
prevent the deficiencies of the latter from exhibiting themselves. Or 



k 



DISCUSSION OF TH^ RESUIvTS AND THlglR BEJARINGS. 85 

again, failure to purify carefully a protein like casein will vitiate the 
study of a problem like the synthesis of amino-acids. Pure casein is 
glycocoll-f ree ; and the continued feeding of such a product as the 
sole protein of the dietary enables one to make deductions respecting 
the synthesis of glycocoU. The use of crude commercial protein 
preparations can never satisfy the requirements of refined study in 
this domain, where small effects continued over long periods are of 
great importance. We believe, therefore, that such considerations 
justify the energy and expense which have been put into the work. 

In relation to the much-discussed problem of the relative value 
of organic vs. inorganic phosphorus in nutrition, our data after feed- 
ing phosphorus-free edestin to growing rats (cf . Charts L^XXV and 
I^XXVI) show a success quite as great as that with phosphorus-con- 
taining casein (cf. Charts LVI, I.VII, LVIII, LIX, and I.X). The 
animals must here have synthesized their phosphorus compounds 
from inorganic phosphorus. Whether milk production and other 
functions calling for such synthetic reactions will continue adequately 
is open to investigation. It is also noteworthy that all of our animals 
grow on a dietary that is purine-free, or essentially so. Here the ques- 
tion of purine synthesis suggests itself. It is apparent, e. g., in the 
case of gliadin, that the grown as well as ungrown rats may be main- 
tained for long periods on single proteins. 

With such an ideal non-protein dietary component at hand 
amino-acid substitutions can be attempted in the adult as well as in 
the growing animal. The protein minimum (or minima) is also open 
to accurate investigation. With a method of feeding devised which 
will permit a differentiation between growth and maintenance, which 
furnishes an energy-yielding protein-free component that is appro- 
priate, and leaves the protein as the sole variable in the dietary, we 
believe that further contributions can be made to the problems of 
nutrition. 

In the preparation of the large quantities of carefully purified 
proteins required for these experiments, we have been assisted by 
Mr. Charles S. I^eavenworth, Mr. Owen Nolan, Mr. I^eigh I. Hol- 
dredge, and Mr. I^awrence Nolan, whose valuable cooperation we 
are glad to acknowledge here.

Charts XLVIII (rat 210, female), 
XLIX (rat 209, male), L (rat 215, male), 
and I/I (rat 216, male) show inadequate 
growth, during period i, on the casein 
food with a small admixture of milk, fol- 
lowed by resumption of growth on a diet 
containing casein and protein-free milk in 
a quantity equivalent to that of our milk- 
paste diet which has proved sufficient to 
promote normal growth. The compo- 
sition of the food was as shown in table.

est inasmuch as the animal successfully passed through two periods of 
pregnancy on a purine-free food containing a single protein. This obviously

Charts LXI (rat 141, female) and I^XII (rat 139, male) show recovery 
of animals maintained on a diet containing casein as the sole protein. The 
preliminary nutritive condition of the rats is shown to be satisfactory in 
period i on a mixed diet. The ultimate decline on the casein diet during 
period 2 could not be checked by increasing the content of casein during 
period 3. This shows that the nutritive failure of the animals was not 
attributable to the protein per se. Speedy recuperation and maintenance 
attended the substitution of protein- 
free milk for the inorganic salt mix- 
ture contained in food previously used. 
Note the influence of this dietary 
change on the appetite of the animals. 
In period i mixed food was used. The 
composition of food, during the other 
periods was as shown in table.

Chart LXX (rat 133, female) shows mainte-

normal growth. Period 2 is of interest because the 
food was also purine-free and devoid of organically 
combined phosphorus. All growth ceased during the 
edestin feeding (period 2), in contrast with other experiences where protein- 
free milk was present in the dietary. 

Chart LXXI (rat 218, female) shows inadequate growth on a diet

Chart LXXX (rat 148, male) shows the failure of maintenance on a 
diet in which edestin formed the sole protein (period 2), until protein-free 
milk was added to the diet (period 3). Period i, on mixed food, is intro; 
duced to show the previous satisfactory nutritive condition of the animal. 
Note the influence of changes in diet on the food consumption. The diet 
consisted of mixed food for period i, and for periods 2 and 3 was as follows:

Charts CVIII (rat 214, female), CIX (rat 219, male), CX (rat 220, 
male), and CXI (rat 213, male) show the failure to induce more than 
slight growth when gliadin forms the sole protein of the dietary, even under 
conditions in which most other proteins have been found effective. That 
the failure to grow is not due to insufficient food intake is evident. The 
character of the diets is given in the table below. 



Period i: p. ci. 

Gliadin food: gliadin (from wheat), 18.0; starch, 32.5; sugar, 

17.0; agar, 5-0; salt mixture I, 2.5; lard. 25.0 90 

Milk food: Trumilk, 60.0; starch. 15.7; salt mixture I. i.o; lard,

Charts CXII (rat 249, female),

(rat 254, female) show the failure of 
the animals to grow normally on a 
diet containing protein-free milk and 
gliadin as the sole protein. It will 
be noted that these animals ate well 
and that the maintenance was better 
than with similar gliadin mixtures 
which contained no protein-free 
milk. The composition of the food

maintenance without growth of medium-sized rats on a diet of protein-free 
milk and hordein, from barley, as the sole protein. Note the undiminished 
appetite during course of experiment. Precisely similar mixtures contain- 
ing other single proteins have sufficed to induce growth. This experiment 
demonstrates the different nutritive value of hordein and most other pro- 
teins and its resemblance in this respect to the chemically similar protein 
gliadin. This is a marked instance of the relation of the chemical consti- 
tution of the protein to nutrition. The composition of the food was as
