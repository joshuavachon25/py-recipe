through a sieve ; braid a teaspoon of flour with a 
small piece of butter, and put into a saucepan ; 
when it has cooked a little, add the tomato, season, 
and add nearly a pint of broth ; let it boil a minute 
or two, and then add a cup of boiled rice, hot, and a 
half-teaspoonful of soda. 

Turkey Soup.— lake the turkey bones and boil 
three-quarters of an hour in water enough to cover 
them ; add a little summer savory and celery chopped 
fine. Just before serving, thicken with a little 
flour (browned ), and seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
a small piece of butter. 

Veal Broth.— Pick and wash a teacup of rice, and 
put into your dinner-pot ; cut up three or four small 
onions and add to the rice ; next, add your meat, 
which should be cut in pieces of about a quarter of 
a pound each ; let the whole be covered with water 
from two to three inches above the meat. When it 
has boiled an hour, add a few small turnips and car- 
rots sliced, with a tablespoonful of salt ; a little 
before it is served add some parsley. This is a 
favorite broth with many people. It' is very nice 
without the carrots. Some prefer it thickened with 
fiour instead of rice. 

Vegetable Soup.— i. Scrape clean, and slice three 
carrots and three turnips ; peel three onions ; fry 
the whole with a little butter till it turns rather yel- 
low ; then add also two heads of celery cut in pieces, 
three or four leeks, also cut in pieces ; stir and fry 
the whole for about six minutes ; when fried, add 
also one clove of garlic, salt, pepper, two cloves, 
and two stalks of parsley ; cover with three quarts 
of water ; keep on rather a slow fire, skim off the 
scum carefully, and simmer for about three hours ; 
then strain and use.

one-quarter ounces of butter, five teaspoonfuls of 
Hour, a teaspoonful of made mustard, salt and pep- 
per to taste, the yolks of two eggs, rather more than 
two quarts of water ; boil the vegetables in the water 
two and one-half hours ; stir them often, and, if the 
water boils away too quickly, add more, as there 
should be two quarts of soup when done. Mix up 
in a basin the butter and (iour, mustard, salt and 
pepper, with a teacupful of cold water ; stir in the 
soup and boil ten minutes. Have ready the yolks 
of the eggs in a tureen ; pour on, stir well, and serve.

cover with about three quarts of water ; keep on a 
rather slow fire, skim off the scum carefully, and 
simmer three hours ; strain and serve.

shin of beef and two pounds of knuckle of veal ; 
remove all the fat and break the bones and take out 
the m.arrow ; put into a pot with five pints of water ;

come to a boil quickly ; remove the scum that rises, 
and set where it will simmer for five hours ; one 
hour before serving, add two young carrots, scraped 
and cut in slices, half a head of celery, and a small 
onion cut into squares ; in half an hour, add one 
turnip sliced, and in fifteen minutes one cauliflower

Vermicelli Soup.-Boil a shin of veal in three 
quarts of water. I'ut in a turnip, an onion, and one 
carrot, whole. Boil about three hours. Add salt 
and a small teacup of vermicelli, and boil for three- 
quarters of an hour. Ikfore addin^^ vermicelli, strain

away. 



FISH. 

Fish when fresh are hard when pressed by the 
finger— the gills red— the eyes full. If the flesh is 
flabbv and the eyes sunken,'the fish are stale. They 
should be thoroughly cleaned, washed, and sprinkled 
with salt. 

llefore broiling fish, rub the gridiron with a piece 
of fat, to prevent its sticking. Lay the skin side 
down first. 

The earthy taste often found in fresh-water fish 
can l)e removed by soaking in salt and water. 

Most kinds of 'salt fish should be soaked in cold 
water for twenty-four hours — the fleshy side turned 
dowMi in the water. 

]<'ish should be fresh, and always well cooked. 

Never soak fresh fish in water, unless frozen. 
Clean, rinse, and wipe dry ; in warm weather, lay 
on the ice until needed. 

\\\ boiling, put into cold water, to which add a 
little salt and vinegar, and allow eight minutes to 
the pound. If boiled whole do not remove the head 
and tail, and serve always with a sauce. 

To Pry.~l>i'e'dge with Hour, dip lightly in beaten 
egg, roll in cracker crumbs, and fry in very hot lard. 
Serve with lemon slices.

and sew it up ; lay strips of salt pork over it, sprinkle 
with pepper, salt, and crumbs, and bake in a hot 
oven ; baste often. 

Baked Fish.— Stuff it with plain dressing ; put in 
a pan with a little water, salt, pepper, and butter, 
IJaste while baking. A tish weighing four pounds 
will bake in an hour. Garnish with hard-boiled 
eggs and parsley, and serve with drawn butter or 
egg sauce. 

To Boil Fish.— Sew them in a cloth, and put in 
cold water, with plenty of salt. Most tish will boil 
in thirty minutes. 

Boiled Fish.— I'our or five pounds of fish, nearly 
cover with water and add two heaping tablespoon- 
fuls of salt. Boil thirty minutes, and serve with 
drawn butter. 

Pickling Fish.— Spice the vinegar as for cucum- 
bers, put your fish in and let them boil slowly for a 
few 'minutes, until done, without breaking ; then set 
them away for several weeks, and the bones will be 
entirely destroyed. 

Bread Stuffing for Fish.-Take about half a 
pound of stale bread and soak m water, and when 
soft press out the water ; add a very little chopped 
suet, pepper, salt, a large tablespoonful of onion 
minced and fried, and, if preferred, a little minced 
parsley ; cook a trifle, and' after removing from the 
tire add a beaten egg. 

Baked Black Fish.— Rub a handful of salt over

fried bread with a sauce made of stock seasoned 
with one tablespoonful each of walnut and Worces- 
tershire sauce, one tablespoonful of chopped capers

with any sauce suitable for fish. 

Boiled Salmon.— A piece of six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boil 
slowly for three quarters of an hour. It should be 
eaten with egg or caper sauce. If any remains after 
dinner, it may be piaced in a deep dish, a little salt 
.prinkled over, and a teacup of boiling vinegar 
)oured upon it. Cover it cksely, and it will make a 
nice breakfast dish.

the fish are the best ; sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
spread on a little butter, and broil over a clear but 
slow fire. 

Codfish Stewed.— Soak the fish in cold water for 
several hours ; pick fine, and put into a saucepan 
with cold water; boil a few minutes; pour ofl the

ters ; put the liquor (a teacupful for three) in a stew- 
pank and add half as much more water, salt, a good 
bit or pepper, a teaspoonful of rolled cracker for 
each. Put on the stove, and let it boil ; have your 
oysters ready in a bowl; the moment the liquor boils 
pour in all your oysters, say ten for each person, or 
six will do. Now watch carefullv, and as soon as it 
begins to boil take out your w^atch, count just thirty 
seconds, take your oysters from the stove. You will 
have your big dish ready, with one and a half table- 
spoonfuls of cream or milk for each person. Pour 
your stew on this, and serve immediately. Never 
boil an oyster in milk if you wish it to be good.

MEATS. 

In selecting beef, choose that of a fine smooth 
grain, of a bright red color and white fat. 

The sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs, are the 
choicest cuts for a roast. Have the bones removed 
and the meat rolled, but have the butcher send the 
bones for soup. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry, and the 
joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton or lamb is a bright red, 
\vith the fat firm and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean will break 
on being pinched ; the fat will be white, soft, and 
pulpy. 

KuLES FOR DoiLixc, ^vIeat. — All fresh meat should 
be put to cook in boiling water, then the outer part 
contracts and the internal juices are preserved. P'or 
making soup, put on in cold water. All salt meat 
should be put on in cold water, that the salt maybe 
extracted in cooking. In boiling meats, it is im- 
portant to keep the water constantly boiling, other- 
wise the meat will absorb the water. Be careful to 
add boiling water, if more is needed. Remove the 
scum when it first begins to boil. Allow about 
twenty nnnutes for boiling for each pound of fresh 
meat. The more gently meat boils, the more tender 
it will be. 

To Broil Meat well, have your gridiron hot 
before you put the meat on.

very eently until tender ; peel off the skin, garnish 
with tufts of cauliflower or lirussels sprouts, and 
serve • boiled tongue is frequently sent to table with 
boiled poultry instead of ham, and is by many 
persons, preferred; if to serve cold, ped it fasten 
it down lo a piece of board by sticking a fork through 
the rooc, and another through the top to straighten 
it • when cold glaze it, and put a i^aper ruche round

larcre smoked tongue four to four and a half hours, a 
small one two and a half to three hours, a large un- 
soaked tongue three to three and a half hours, a 
small one, two to two and a half hours. 

Broiled Ham and Eggs.-C ut the ham in thm 
slices, take off the rind, wash the slices in cold 
water, and lay them on the gridiron over quick 
coals ; turn frequenllv, and they will soon be broiled ; 
take them up on a platter, previously warmed, butter 
and pepper the ham ; have ready on the hre a pan 
of boiling water from the teakettle ; break into it cs 
many eggs as you require for the meal, and, when 
the '' white" is done, dip out each egg carefully with 
a spoon, so as to keep it whole, and set it on one of

the bone from the middle, also all the juristic and 

tough parts about the edges. Have ready half a 

pound of fat salt pork. Cut into strips as thick and 

long as your finger. Prepare a nice dressing the 

same as for stuffing a turkey. With a thin sharp 

knife make perpendicular incisions in the meat 

about half an inch apart. Thrust into them the 

pork and work in with them some of the dressing. 

Proceed thus until the meat is thoroughly plugged. 

Put it into a baking pan with a little water at^'the 

bottom, cover tightly and bake slowly four hours ; 

then uncover and spread the rest of the dressing 

over the top, and bake until a nice brown. After 

taking up, thicken the gravy and pour over the beef. 

It should be sliced horizontallv. Is good either hot 

or cold. 

Boileau. — Take a piece of beef weighing six or 
eight pounds, have the bone taken out; then rub it 
well w'ith a mixture composed c f ground cloves, 
allspice, black pepper, sweet marjoram, and salt, one 
teaspoonful of each rubbed fine. After the mixture 
is well rubbed in, roll it up tightly and tie it; put it 
into a pot half full of water, with three or four pota- 
toes, a carrot, two turnips, if small, and two onions, 
and let it stew six hours. 

Breakfast dish. — Ciiop fine as much cold beef or 
mutton as is required ; add a pint, more or less of 
good soup stock; season with pepnen salt, and 
ground cloves ; thicken with browned .lour and poui

Croquettes. — Raw pork chopped fine, two cups' 
one incdiuin-sized onion, chopped fine; teaspoonful

cover well and place where it will cook very slowly 
for three or <"our hours ; it to Ik- used cold/ simmer 
until the bones can be easily removed, and then 
press in a square mold. 

2. Select a nice piece of fresh beef ; rub over 
sufficient salt to "com" it, but not to make it very 
salt; let ic stand two or three days, judging of the 
lime by the size of the meat ; then wash thoroughly 
in cold water, and putting in the pot, cover with 
cold water and boil gently till quite tender; add 
such vegetables as are desired like the old time- 
honored *' boiled dish ; " judge of the quantity of 
vegetables by the strength of flavor desired in the 
soup to be made from the water in which the whole 
is boiled ; when done, dish beef and vegetables, and

Prossod Boef. — Cure a piece of brisket with salt 
and j)ulverized saltpetre for five days; boil gently 
until tender ; press until perfectly cold. 

Beef Tongue. — If it is corned it should be soaked 
for twenty-four hours before boiling. It will require 
from three to four hours, according to size. I'he 
skin should always be removed as soon as it is 
taken from the pot. An economical method is to 
lay the tongue, as soon as ♦li. km is removed, in a 
jar, coiled up, with the ti^ .uis'de the root, and a 
weight upon it. When it is col<, loosen the sides 
with a knife and turn it out. The slices being cut 
horizontally all round, the lat and lean will go to- 
gether. 

Savory Beef. — Take a shin of beef from the hind 
quarter, saw it into four pieces, put it into a pot and 
boil it until the meat and gristle drop from the 
bones ; chop the meat very fine, put it in a dish and 
season it with a little salt,' pepper, clove, and sage 
to your taste ; pour in the liquor in which the meal 
was boiled and place it away to harden. Cut in 
slices and eat cold. 

Scrambled Eggs with Beef. — Dried beef chipped 
very fine ; put butter and lard into a skillet, and

(which must be hot) to bake it. liake in a \uiick 
oven. ^ 

Beefsteak smothered with Onions.— Put in the 

skillet a httle hircl and the steak ; peel and sHce the 
onions and lay them over the meat till the skillet is 
full; season with pepper and salt, cover tightlvand 
place over the fire. After the juice of the onions 
has boiled away and the meat begins to frv, remove 
the onions, turn the meat to brown on the o'ther side 
then replace the onions as before, being careful 
that they do not burn. 

Chopped Steak.— 'I'ake a sirloin steak raw remove 
the bone and al! gristle or stringy pieces, and chop 
until a perfect mince; season with salt and pepper- 
make into a large Hat cake about one-half of an inch 
thick ; put into a skillet a good-sized piece of butter 
and when quite hot put in the steak, and fry brown 
on both sides. .Make a little gravy in the skillet 
and pour over the meat. This is a nice way to use 
the ends from tenderloin steaks. The meat cannot 
be chopped too fine. 

^ Stuffed Beefsteak.— l^ake a rump steak about an 
inch thick; make a stuffing of bread, herbs, etc and 

spread it over the steak. Roll it up, and with a I 

needle and coarse thread sew it together. Lay it in t 

an iron pot on one or two wooden skewers, and put I 

in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it stew I 

slowly for two hours; longer if the beef is tou-h • ' 

serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. "^To j

[rain off all the liquor, put them into the stew-pan 
[with half of a small cupful of butter, or less butter 
and a little sweet cream ; let them boil, and turn 
them over the steak on the platter. Oysters broiled 
and laid on the steak are very nice. 

Steak and Oysters.— Take one pound best rump 
steak without any fat ; put in an oval dish a dozen 
and a half oysters (taking care to remove the hard 
part and beard), with the liquor from the oysters to 
cover them ; put the steak on them, cover the top 
of the steak with two onions cut in the thinnest pos- 
sible manner ; put another dish inverted over the 
steak, then put a paste round the edge of both dishes 
and put this into a gentle oven for an hour. Re- 
verse the dishes for five minutes, then take off the 
dish which was originally at the top, and serve. 

Broiled Beefsteak.— Have the choice stenks cut 
three-quarters of an inch thick ; grease the gridiron 
and have it quite hot. Put the steak over a hot, 
clear hre and cover. When the steak is colored, turn 
it over, which must be done without sticking a fork 
into it and thus letting out the juice. Jt should be 
quite rare or pink in the center, but not raw. When 
cooked sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season 
with pepper and salt, and spread over the top some 
small bits of butter, and serve immediately. 

Mock Duck.— Take a round steak ; make stuffing 
as for turkey; spread the stuffing on the steak, roll 
it up and tie it ; roast from half to three-quarters of 
an hour. 

Roast VoaL- Take a loin of veal, make a stuffing 
the same as for roast turkey, fill the tlat with the 
stuffing and secure it tlrmly on to the loin ; rub the 
veal with salt, pepper, and a little butter ; put it into 
a pan with a little water. While roasting baste fre

fied butter on top. This cuts very prettily hke 
veined marble. White meat of fowls may be used 
instead of veal. 

AGoodpreparatioiiof Veal.— I. The following 
is an excellent mode of preparing veal to be eaten 
cold, and for keeping it on hand for several d.\ys, 
ready for immediate use : Take say three and a half 
poun'ds— the thick part of the leg is preferable, with 
the tough, tendonous parts removed— chop it fine 
without cooking ; mix well with it four soda crackers 
rolled line, three well-beaten eggs, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, one tablespoonful of pepper, half a nut- 
meg, two tablespoonfuls of cream, or a small piece 
of butter; make it into a loaf, and bake in a drip- 
ping-pan without water, with quick heat at first, to 
close the outside and retain the juices, and continue 
the baking about one and a quarter to one and a 
half hours ; serve cut in thin slices ; an excellent 
lunch in traveling. ^ ^ ' 

2. Butter a good-sized bowl, and line it with thin 
slices of hard-boiled eggs ; have veal and ham both 
in very thin slices : place in the bowl a layer of veal, 
with pepper and salt, then a layer of ham, omitting 
the salt, then a layer of veal, and so on, alternating 
with veal and ham, until the bowl is filled ; make a 
paste of flour and water, as stiff as it can be rolled 
out ; cover the contents of the bowl with the paste, 
and over this tie a double cotton cloth ; put the 
bowl into a saucepan, or other vessel, with water 
just up to the rim of the bowl, and boil three hours ; 
then take it from the fire, remove the cloth and 
paste, and let it stand until the next day, when it 
may be turned out and served in very thin slices.

Calf's Liver Stewed.— Cut the liver into small 
slices, about three inches square. Into your sauce- 
pan pi ice two onions, sliced fine, a tablespoonful of 
sage, one of summer savory, a little pepper, and salt ; 
then add your liver, and cover with water, and let it 
stew for two hours. Just before you serve it, dredge 
on a little flour, and add a tablespoonful of butter. 

To dress Calf's Head like Turtle.— Let them 
boil an hour and a half, with salt in the water ; tie 
the brains in a cloth bajj, and boil half an hour; 
when all is done, take out the bones and cut in 
pieces. Add to your liquor a little sweet marjoram, 
a nutmeg grated, clove, mace, and pepper, to taste, 
half a pint of ketchup, half a pound of butter ; then 
put in the meat, and boil a few minutes, and it is 
done. 

Mock Terrapin.— Half a calf's liver, season and 
fry brown, hash it, but not very fine, flour it thickly, 
then add a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a little 
cayenne pepper, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, 
a lump of butter the size of an egg, a teacup of 
water. Let it boil a minute or two. Cold veal will 
do as well as liver. 

Broiled Calf's Liver with Bacon.— Procure a 
nice calf's liver, wash and cut in thin slices, broil 
over a clean fire, with thin slices of breakfast bacon. 
Season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Sweetbreads with Mushrooms.— I'^^rboil sweet-

inch square, stew until tender; sHce mushrooms and 
stew ni the Hquor for one hour, then add to the 
sweetbreads a coffee cup of cream, pepper and salt, 
and a tablespoonful of butter. Sweetbreads boiled 
and served with green peas make a very nice dish. 

Sweetbreads with Tomatoes.— Take sweetbreatis 
and parboil them, put them into a stew-pan and sea- 
son with salt and cayenne --pper to taste; place 
over a slow fire mix one large tablespoonful of 
browned flour with a small piece of butter, add a 
leaf of mace ; stir butter and gravy well together, and 
let all stew for half an hour; then set the stew-pan 
in the oven, and when the sweetbreads are nicely 
browned place them on a dish ; pour the gravy into 
a half pint of stewed tomatoes thickened with a tea- 
spoonful of flour and a small piece of butter and 
seasoned. Strain it through a wire sieve into the 
stew-pan, let it come to a boil, and stir until done ; 
then pour over the sweetbreads, and send to the 
table very hot. 

Tried Tripe.— Scrape the tripe well ; cut into 
squares the size of your hand ; boil in salt and water 
(a tablespoonful of salt to one quart of water) till 
very tender. The next day cut into smaller pieces, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, fry 
brown on both sides in a pan of ^hot lard. When 
done, take it out, pour nearly all the lard out, add a 
good gill of boiling water, thicken with flour mixed 
smooth with a tablespoon of vinegar; season to taste, 
and pour hot over the tripe. A nice breakfast dish!

THE PRE.^nUM COOK' noOK. 



Roast Rabbit. — i. Clean and put into a drip- 
pinppan with a small onion and carrot sliced ; 
sprinkle with salt, pepper, and spread with butter ; 
put into a quick oven with water enough to ( )ver 
the bcittoni of the pan, and baste frequently: add 
more water if needed; when done, strain the gravy 
over the rabbit, nnd serve with cranberry sauce. 

2. Dress nicely and till with a dressing made of 
bread crumbs, a little onion, sage, pepper, and 
salt, and a small piece of butter; tie a piece of salt 
pork over it; put into a dripping-pan with a little 
water, in a quick oven ; baste often : serve with 
currant jelly. 

Rabbit Pie.— Line a deep dish with a pulf paste 
or rich biscuit crust ; stew the rabbit, season well, 
and pour into the dish ; cover with an upper crust, 
and bake. 

Snipe.— Clean nicely and singe; put a piece of 
butter into each one, and tie a small piece of bacon 
over the breast, and bake, basting frequently; serve 
with water-cress. 



POULTRY. 

How^ TO Choose r<rLTRV.— Young, plump, and 
well fed, but not too fat poultry are the best. 'J'he 
skin should be fine-grained, clear, and white ; the 
breast full, fleshed, and broad ; the legs smooth. 
The birds must be heavy in proportion to their size. 
As regards ducks and geese, their breasts must also 
be plump ; the feet flexible and yellow. For boil- 
ing, white-legged poultry must be chosen, because 
when dressed their appearance is by far the more 
delicate. But darker-legged ones are juicy and of

Boiled Turkey.— Soak it in salt and water for an 
hour and a half, to make it white. Make the stuffin<^ 
of bread crumbs and about half the quantity of suet'' 
a little parsley and a little lemon-peel, chopped fine! 
Scald the parsley, in order to have it green. Put all* 
these in the breast. Tie lightly in cloth, and boil \ 
young turkey will boil in two hours ; an older one 
will of course require a longer time. Garnish with 
parsley and lemon cut in slices. 

Boiled Turkey.— Stuff the turkey as for roastin^-. 
A very nice dressing is made by chopping half "a 
pint of oysters, and mixing them with bread crumbs 
butter, pepper, salt, thyme, and wet with milk or 
water. Baste about the turkey a thin cloth the 
inside of which has been dredged with fiour, and put 
It to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt in 
It. Let a large turkey simmer for three hours ; skim 
while boiling. Serve with oyster sauce, made by 
adding to a cupful of the liquor in which the turkev 
was boiled the same quantity of milk, and eio-ht 
oysters chopped fine; season with minced parsley 
stir m a spoonful of rice or wheat flour wet with cold 
milk : a tablespoonful of butter. Boil up once and

their own livers, shred with beef suet, bread crumbs 
parsley, marjoram, and two eggs ; sew them up and 
put into the jar with half a pound of butter; stop up 
the jug, so that no steam can get out, then set them 
in a pot of water to stew ; they will take two hours,

SALADS. 

Mayonnaise Salad Dressing.— The yolk of one 
egg, raw ; stir into this all the olive oil it will hold, 
in as fine a stream as possible. Season with cay- 
enne pepper, salt, and mustard. 

Simple Dressing for Salads.— Mix three table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil and one tablespoonful of 
scraped onion with one saltspoonful of salt and one 
saltspoonful of pepper (mixed), and then add one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. When thoroughly mixed, 
pour over the salad. 

Chicken Salad Dressing.— Take two hard-boiled 
eggs, lay them into water till quite cold, put the 
yolks into a small bowl and mash them very iine, 
adding the yolks of two raw eggs, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one large tablespoonful of dry mustard, a 
very little cayenne pepper ; stir this well, always 
one way ; when well mixed, add a very little sweet 
oil, stirring all the time. After this is mixed, put in 
more, a very little at a time, until you have used a 
third of a bottle, then add a large spoonful of vin- 
egar or lemon juice, then more oil as before, using in 
all two-thirds of • bottle, then another spoonful of 
vinegar ; when well mixed it must be very light, and 
a nice color. Set on the ice for two or three hours; 
not more than twenty minutes before using the 
salad, mix it and prepare for the table by putting 
with the meat about half the dressing, stir it up

well, and then pour on to the meat one wine gl 



of best vineijar ; stir th 



ass 



IS up well, it will turn the 



chicken very white ; if it requires a little more salt, 
add it now. Place the chicken in the centre of a 
flat dish, large enough to lay lettuce or celery 
around the meat, wipe the lettuce as dry as you can, 
and lay around the meat, then with a spoon put the 
rest of the dressing on the lettuce. 

Chicken Salad.— i. To two large boiled fowls 
(cold) take two large heads of celery or four small 
ones ; having removed all the skin and the fat, cut 
the meat from the bonces into very small pieces ; it 
is best not to mix the dressing with the salad until 
just before it is to be eaten. Put into a porcelain 
kettle the gravy from the chicken, one-half pint of 
vinegar, one-half pint of sweet oil or melted butter, 
one large tablespoonful of Colman's mustard, one 
small teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, the yolks of eight eggs beaten and stirred 
in just before taken off, one teacup of cream stirred 
into the dressing when cold ; mix together with a 
silver fork, and garnish with celery tops. 

2. Three chickens boiled until tender ; when cold 
chop, but not too fine, add twice the quantity of 
celery cut fine, and three hard-boiled eggs sliced ; 
make a dressing with two cups of vinegar, half cup 
of butter (or two tablespoonfuls of oil) two eggs 
beaten with a large tablespoonful of mustard, salt- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
tablespoonful of pepper, or a little cayenne pepper, 
put the vinegar into a tin pail and set' in a kettle of 
boiling water ; beat the other ingredients together 
thoroughly, and stir slowly into the vinegar until it 
thickens. Pour over the salad just before serving.

four hours before needed, and if kept in a warm 
place they will be crisp and nice. They are used for 



garnishing game and steaks. 



Potato Cakes.— Two pounds of mashed potatoes, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and a little salt, two 
pounds of Hour, and milk enough to make a batter, 
one-half cupful of yeast ; set it to rise, and when 
light bake in cakes size of a muffin. 

Mashed Potatoes.— Wash and cut in halves or 
(juarter-s, put into boiling water, boil one-half hour; 
when done pour off all the water, adding salt ; mash 
perfectly smooth ; then add cream if you have it ; if 
not milk, and beat well with fork and spoon. The 
beating makes them light. 

Broiled Potatoes.— 'lake cold boiled potatoes, 
peel and slice them in slices one-third of an inch 
thick, dip them into dissolved butter, place on a 
^^ridiron over a very clear tire, grill them until nicely 
browned underneath ; then turn them and when a 
nice color put them into a heated dish ; sprinkle 
with salt and pepper and serve hot. 

Potatoes A-la-Delmonico.— Cut the potatoes with 
a vegetable cutter into small balls about the size of 
a marble ; put them into a stew-pan with plenty of

ix hours if not previously very tender — with a 
:ood deal of liquor in the jar or pan. Those who 
ase pork at all, usually put a piece of fat pork in the 
dish of beans prepared for baking, but some of us 
very much perfer a seasoning of cream or butter. 
Split pea-soup or common unsplit dried peas, boiled 
five to six hours without meat, is very nutritious, and 
much liked by many ; I season it with salt, and cream 
1- milk, if I have it— the more the better— otherwise 
with butter. 

Baked Beans. — Soak a pint and a half of dried 
l)cans over night ; in the morning pour off the water, 
cover with fresh water, and boil until they crack open, 
or are very tender; then put them with the water in 
wliich they were boiled, into a deep earthen dish 
adding a little salt, and, if agreeable, a tablespoonful 
of molasses ; put on top of the dish one half pound 
uf fat and lean pork or corn beef, which should be 
Leashed or scored across the rind ; bake four hours, and 
"Lnger, if convenient; it will be better for it, only 
bake slowly ; keep nearly covered with water till two- 
thirds done, then allow it to dry away. 

Greens.— This is the simplest of dishes, yet it is 
not always a well-served one. Careens should be 
])roperly b )iled ; the water should be soft, and a 
tablespoonful of salt added to a large-sized pot or 
pan which should be boiling hot when the greens are 
thrown in ; it should be kept boiling until they are 
done, which can be told by their sinking to the bot- 
tom of the pot, and then they should be skimmed out 
as quickly as possible into a colander so that all 
the water will run out; press them with a small plate, 
and then turn upon a 'platter, add a large piec 
butter and cut up fme. Serve smoking hot.

Macaroni with Tomatoes.— Boil one-half pound 
of macaroni till tender, pour off all the water, then 
add one-half cup of sweet cream, one-third of a cup 
of butter, pepper, and salt ; let simmer for a short 
time, but be careful that it does not become much 
broken ; turn into vegetable dish ; have ready one 
pint of stewed tomatoes ; season with butter, salt,

Boiled Onions.— Skin them thoroughly. Put them 
to boil ; when they have boiled a few minutes, pour off 
the water and add clean cold water, and then set them 
to boil again. Pour this away and add more cold 
water, when they may boil till done. This will make 
them white and clear, and very mild in tiavor. After 
they are done, pour off all the water, and dress with 
a little cream, salt and pepper to taste. 

Escalloped Onions.— Boil till tender six large 
onions ; afterward separate them with a large spoon ; 
then place a layer of onions and a layer of grated 
breadcrumbs alternately in a pudding-dish ; season

Pried Parsnips.-Scrape, cut into strips, and boil 
until tender in salted water; drain and dip into 
batter made with one egg beaten light, one-half 
cup of milk, and flour enough to make a batter, and 
fry in hot butter or lard. 

Asparagus.— Cook only the tender green stalks • 
cut them of equal lengths, and boil in water with^a 
little salt till tender. While the asparagus is cook- 
mg prepare some nicely toared bread, lay the aspar- 
agus on tht^ toast and season witn butter, salt and 
pepper or pour over it a little cream previously 
scalded. ^ 

Spinach.— Spinach requires good washing and

Parsnip Stew.— Three slices of salt pork, boil one 
hour and a half ; scrape five large parsnips, cut in 
(|uarters lengthwise, add to the pork, and let boil 
f;ne-half hour, then add a few potatoes, and let all 
boil together until the potatoes are soft ; the fluid in 
the kettle should be about a cupful when ready to 
lake off. 

Green Peas.— Put the pods into a pot, cover and 
boil thoroughly, then strain and put the peas into 
the same water and boil tender. Season with butter, 
pepper, a little salt, and the least bit of sugar. 

Boiled Hominy.— ^oak one cup of tine hominy in

fifteen minutes. 

Cauliflower.— Trhn off all the outside leaves, and 
put into boiling v/ater well salted ; boil until tender, 
and then jerve with a white sauce or with cream. 

To Fry Parsley.— This, when done as it should be, 
is one of the nicest as well as cheapest of garnish- 
ings. The parsley should be washed and dried in a 
cloth ; then if one is the happy possessor of a wire 
basket, put in the parsley and hold from two to three 
minutes in boiling drippings ; take from the basket 
and dry until crisp before the kitchen fire. It may 
be fried without a basket, but • quires more care in 

so doing. 

Stewed Mushrooms.— Wash them, cut off the ends 
of the stalks and peel them; put them in a stew-pan 
without any water, and season with salt and pepper ; 
add two ounces of butter roll in two teaspoonfuls of 
flour to every pint of mushrooms ; cover them closely 
and let them simmer slowly until they are soft.

EQQS AND OriELETS. 

Proper way to cook Eggs.— Butter a tin plate 
and break in your eggs ; set in a steamer ; place 
over a kettle of boiling water, and steam until the 



^^ 






102 



THE rRKMIUM COOK BOOK. 



whites are cooked ; they are more ornamental when 
broken into patty-tins, as they keep their form bet- 
ter ; the whites of tlie e;2:^rs;when cooked in this 
manner, are tender and h;j;ht, and not tough and 
leathery, as if cooked by any other process ; they 
can be eaten by invahds, and'they certainly are very 
inuch richer than by any otlier method ; \\ cooked 
in the shell, they taste of the lime contained in them, 
and, if broken into boiIin<r water, it destroys their 
flavor. 

To Preserve Eggs.— Pack them when perfectly 
fresh, in wheat bran, the small ends down, and so 
loosely as to prevent their comin<^ in contact with 
each other, or the sides or bottom of the vessel 
which contains them. Cover carefully with bran, 
well pressed down, 

A nice Cheese Relish.— I'our ounces of Hour, 
four ounces of cheese, and three of butter, salt, pep- 
per, and a dash of cayenne pepper ; knead it all to- 
gether, roll thin, cut in strips like ladies' fingers, 
and bake a delicate brown. 

Scrambled Eggs with Ham.— Put into a pan, 
butter, a little pepper and salt and a little milk; 
wnen liot drop in the eggs, and with a knife cut the 
eggs and scrape them from the bottom ; add some 
cold ham chopped iaie, and when done serve in a 
hot dish. 

To Poach Eggs.— Have the water well salted, and 
not let it boil hard. Break the eggs separately into 
a saucer, and slip gently into the water; when nicely 
done, remove with a skimmer, trim neatly, and lay 
each Q^^^ upon a small, thin square of buttered toast, 
then sprinkle with salt and pepper. Some persons 
prefer them poached, rather than fried, with ham, in 
which case, substitute the ham for toast.

BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. 

In selecting flour first look to the color. If it 
is white, with a yellowish straw-color tint, buy it. 
\i it is white, with a bluish cast, or with black soecks 
in it, refuse it. Next examine its adhesiveness— wet 
and knead a little of it between your fingers ; if it 
^yorks soft and sticky, it is poor. Then throw a 
little lump of dried flour against a smooth surface; 
if it falls like powder, it is bad. Lastly, squeeze 
some of the flour tightly in your hand; if it retains 
the shape given by the pressure that, too, is a good 
sign. It is safe to buy flour that will stand all these 
tests. 

Three things are indispensable to success in bread 
making; good flour, good yeast, and watchful care; 
a fourth might be added : experience. 

In winter, always warm the flour for bread, and 
keep the sponge near the stove, where it will not get 
chilled. 

Bread should be put into a rather hot oven. An 
hour is the time usually allowed for baking. 

Rolls and biscuits should bake quickly. To 
make them a nice color, rub them over with warm 
water just before putting them into the oven, to 
glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar. 

Baking powder and soda biscuit should be made 
as rapidly as possible, laid into hot pans and put in 
a quick oven. 

Gem pans should be heated and well greased.

then add one cupful of good yeast. Next day corl 
up tight in a jug. 

Yeast and Bread.— Take ten large potatoes, pare, 
and put them in a kettle with three quarts of water] 
put a pint of hops in a thin muslin bag in the same| 
kettle with potatoes ; boil until potatoes are soft, 
then pour the water from this kettle boiling hot over] 
a pint of flour in a crock. Squeeze all the strength 
from the hops ; mash the potatoes, add a quart*of| 
cold water to them, and put through a colander into 
the crock, and add one-half teacup of salt, a cup of 
sugar, one tablespoonful of ginger. Let this stand 
for two days until it stops fermenting and settles; 
then put into a jug, cork tight, and keep in a cool 
place. 

For the Bread.— Pare and boil six good-sized 
potatoes, drain off the water, mash fine, and pour 
over them about three pints of cold water, and run 
through a colander; add flour until this is a thin 
batter, then put in a cupful of yeast from the jug. 
Let stand until it rises, and then stir into flour as 
much as you can with a spoon, and let it rise again. 
Work in enough more flour to make as stiff as bread. 
and let rise the third time. When light this time 
work out into loaves and let rise. All the flour must 
be sifted. 

Vienna Bread.— The following is the recipe by 
which the Vienna bread was made that became so 
famous on the Centennial grounds : Sift in a tin 
pan four pounds of flour, bank up against the sides ; 
pour in one quart of milk and water, and mix into 
it enough flour to form a thin batter, then quickly 
and lightly add one pint of milk, in which is dis- 
solved one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter 
ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour

Buckwheat Cakes.— Take warm water, and 
thicken it with flour, to which add a tablespoonful 
of molasses to make them brown well. Iji ewers' 
yeast is best, but it cannot generally be obtained 
except in large towns. In the morning add a little 
soda. If the batter is of the right consistence, and 
the cakes baked quickly and eaten direct from the 
griddle, they will be quite different from the tough, 
heavy things too often stacked up before the fire. 

Bread Pancakes.— Soak the bread and drain ; to 
two cups of bread add one of flour, milk enough to 
make a thin batter, two teaspoonfuls baking pow- 
der, and one Q.gg, beaten light. 

Corn Meal Pancakes.— Take two cups of Indian 
meal and a teaspoonful of salt : pour over it boiling 
water to make a batter ; stand until cool, and then 
add the yolks of thiee eggs beaten, flour to make 
the proper consistency, one and a half teaspoonfuls 
baking powder; just before baking add the whites, 
beaten stiff. 

Eice Pancakes.— One-half cup of cold boiled rice, 
mixed with one pint of milk; and the yolks of three 
eggs, and flour (in which has been mixed a good tea- 
spoonful of baking powder and a little salt) to make 
a batter ; bake on the griddle, and while hot spread 
with jelly or jam ; roll up, trim and sprinkle over 
with sugar ; must be eaten hot. 

Tomato Pancakes.— Make a batter with one cup 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls sugar, salt, teaspoonful 
baking powder and two cups of milk, adding last 
three eggs, beaten light ; slice large tomatoes, season, 
cover with the batter, and bake on a griddle.

Fried Corn Bread.— lake pieces of cold corn 
bread, and crumble them up fine ; put them in a 
saucepan, pouring in a little hot water, just to 
moisten ; add butter, pepper, and salt ; mix and

and add one-half teacupful of milk ; dip into this 
mixture slices of bread, and fry them in butter till 
slightly browned ; serve piping hot. 

2. For a family of five, take live slices of bread 
(the longer the bread has been baked the better), 
and have ready a bowl of water, into which a pinch 
of salt has been dropped ; take a piece of butter the 
size of a walnut, and thoroughly grease the bottom 
of a frying-pan ; th<'n beat five eggs to a froth ; dip 
each slice of bread into the water, then into the ^^^^ 
and place it fiat on the bottom of the frying-pan ; 
pour over the bread the re naining Q,'g^ which was 
left in the bowl ; set the frying-pan over the fire, 
carefully turning the bread over when it becomes a 
light brown ; pepper and salt to taste, and rest as- 
sured that as often as it is brought on the table, just 
so often will your dinner be praised.

trouble of watching it to see if it is of right consist- 
tucy and adding more meal. As soon as the water 
boils, pour in one part meal. These coarse mea s 
do not require stirring up. Let it boil up smartly 
until it sets or is evenly diffused through the water.

TffF'. PREMIU.V COOK BOOK. 



then set it back where it will not boil so fast, and, 

after half an hour, place it where it will hardly sim! 

mer. Let it cook half an hour at least, and two 

hours if possible. Jf the time is limited, put it to 

soak before-hand, and stir it when heating up 

After that it requires no stirring. The slimyness 

often complained of is due to the constant stirring 

which some cooks practice. The surest way to 

avoid scorching is to cook it in a double kettle, or in 

a tin dish set into a kettle of boiling water, then all 

the attention it requires is to keep water in tlie 

kettle beneath and to see that it boils. Disturb as 

httle as possible when dishing, and allow it to stand 

a few minutes before serving. With the Scotch and 

other hne oatmeals, the process is much the same, 

only they require much stirring while setting, and 

the proportion of meal is much greater after that. It 

is particularly important not to stir them until 

served. The time required to cook them is less, but 

an hour is none too much to get the best results 

from the Scotch (or Canadian, as it is sometimes 

called). ]]ut no amount of cooking will make them 

equal to the coarser kinds in delicacv of flavor. A 

coffee cup of oatmeal will suffices for five or six 

persons, as the main dish for breakfast. 

Oatmeal Mush Improved.— Much better than the 
old way of stirring the oatmeal into boiling water is 
the new way of cooking it in a farina-kettle. If no 
farina-kettle or steam-cooker is at hand, one may 
always be improvised in this way : Set a stone jar 
or a tin pail, containing the food to be cooked, into 
a kettle of water, putting a couple of sticks under 
the jar to keep it from coming in contact with the 
bottom of the kettle.

PUDDINGS, 

In boiling pudding, have plenty of water in the 
pot boiling when the pudding is put in, and do not 
let it stop ; add more as it is needed. Turn the 
pudding frequently. If a cloth is used, dip the 
pudding when done into a pan of cold water, so that 
ii can be removed easily. 

In using molds, grease well with butter, tie the 
lid closely, and set in a pot with very little water, and 
add more as needed. 

Fruit sauces are nice with blanc-mange and corn-r 
starch puddings. 

Fresh red cherries, stewed, sweetened, and passed 
through a sieve, and slightly thickened with corn- 
starch, make a good sauce. 

Beat the eggs separately. 

If a mold is used for boiling, be sure to have it 
well greased. 

A bag or cloth should be wrung out of hot water 
and well floured. 

\\\ boiling, always put the pudding into boiling 
water, enough to cover. 

Boiled and steamed puddings require nearly twice 
as much time as baked. 

Apple Dumplings. — Use good-sized rather tart 
pare and remove the cores : envelono each 
separately in puff-paste, and tie it in a piece of 
cloth; boil or steam for one hour; before serving, 
remove the cloths, cut a piece from each, and put 
in some sugar and fresh butter ; replace the piece

Cracked Wheat.— Ihis excellent dish is often 
<j-)oiled l)y very ^ood cooks, who think they nmst 

loo 



nir. 



slir it all the time to keep it from burni 
iiuich stirring makes it like paste ; putting in more 
water when nearly done has the same eflect. One- 
hird of wheat by measure to two-thirds of water, 
^oft if you have it, will make it about right ; the 
water should be cold when the wheat is put in ; it 
should cook slowlv and be covered closelv. \\\ this 
way scarcely any stirring will be found necessary. 
There is a deliciousness in this dish, when cooked 
as above, which is never found if stirred while cook- 
ing. The same may be said of oatmeal, only the 
latter should be quickly stirred into boi/ifi^ v.ater ; 
cover closely, and let cook for about twenty minutes. 
Wheat may be cooked about the same time, although 
it bears cooking longer. 

Roley-Poley.— Mi^ke a good biscuit dough, and 
roll about three-quarters of an inch thick, and spread 
with berries, preserves, or slices of apple ; roll up, 
and tie in a cloth ; boil or steam an hour and a half. 

Snow Pudding.— ( Hie-half box gelatine soaked 
ten or fifteen minutes in four tablespoonfuls of cold 
water • then add a pint of boiling water, the juice of 
two lemons, and one cup of sugar ; strain it, and set 
away to cool ; when cool — not .stiff — add the well- 
beaten whites of three eggs, mix thoroughly, and 
pour into a mold and cool. 

Suet Pudding.— One cup of suet chopped fme, 
one cup raisins, one cup currants, one cup mo- 
lasses, one cup milk, two and one-half cups flour, 
teaspoon baking-powder, one-half teaspoon cin-

Imitation Plum Pudding.— Soak some dried ap- 
ples all night ; in the morning chop very fine, put a 
teacupful of them into a pint of molasses, and keep 
slightly warm for an hour or two ; after that add one 
cup of chopped suet, one of water, one of chopped 
raisins, a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, 
three pints of flour, and two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Tut the flour in last, and stir all together 
thoroughly. Boil two hours and a lialf in a bowl or 
tin pudding-mold. This may be eaten with lemon 
sauce, and is a good imitation of a genuine plum 
pudding. 

Baked Apple Pudding.— Six apples well stewed, 
quarter of a pound of butter — half of it stirred into the 
apple while hot — and sugar to your taste ; when cold 
add six eggs, well beaten, to the apple. Pound and 
sift six crackers, butter your dish, and put in a layer 
of crackers and a layer of your prepared apple, and 
thus until you have filled your dish. Let the cracker 
be the upper layer, and put the remainder of your 
butter in small bits upon it. Pake half an hour. 

Excellent Baked Apples.— Take ten or twelve 
good-sized juicy apples, pare and core; butter a 
Ijaking-dish, and put in it the apples ; fill the cavities 
with sugar ; take a half teacup of butter and table- 
spoonful of flour, rub together until smooth ; to this 
put enough boiling water to make it thin enough to 
cover each apple; grate over them nutmeg; bake 
in a slow oven one hour or more ; can be eaten with 
meat, or used as a dessert with cream. 

Apple or Peach Pudding.— Pare and quarter fine 
sour apples, and half fill a gallon crock with them ; 
take light bread dough, roll half an inch thick, cut 
small places for the air to escape, and spread over 
the apples as you would an upper crust for pie,*

PASTRY. 



For pastry use the best of materials. 

In warm weather keep the paste in the refrigerator 
until wanted, and bake in a hot oven. 

A well-beaten egg rubbed with a bit of cloth over 
the lower crust of pies will prevent the juice from 
soakins: through it. 

Puff paste should always be made of sweet, solid 
butter. 

The juice of fruit pies, if thickened with a little 
corn starch, will not " boil over. " 

In making a good pastry it is necessary to have 
the butter sweet, the lard fresh ; the flour should be 
of the best quality, and sifted ; the water for wetting 
as cold as possible — ice water preferable. In rolling 
the crust roll always one way, and bake in a quick 
oven. 

Pastry.— To one cup of water take one-half cup 
of lard, a little salt, and some flour ; mix together 
with a knife. When stiti enough roll out on a board, 
spread on with a knife a layer of lard, and sift over 
a little flour; roll all together, and then roll out on 
the board again, repeating this three or four times, 
the entire amount of lard used for one cup of water 
should be about two cups. 

Puff Paste.— A. One pound of flour, one pound 



of builer, one c<:ir : mix the flour with a

as for sauce ; after it is cold, break the white of one 
Q^rcr in a dish ; turn your apple-sauce over it and 
whip with a fork thirty minutes. Care should be

a half teaspoons of baking powder ; hll teacup al er-

arranging around the stand adds to the appearance 
of the table.
