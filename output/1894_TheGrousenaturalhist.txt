PREFACE 



THE design of the Fur and Feather Series is to 
present monographs, as complete as they can 
possibly be made, on the various English birds 
and beasts which are generally included under 
the head of Game. 

Books on Natural History cover such a vast 
number of subjects that their writers necessarily 
find it impossible to deal with each in a really 
comprehensive manner ; and it is not within 
the scope of such works exhaustively to discuss 
the animals described, in the light of objects of 
sport. Books on sport, again, seldom treat at 
length of the Natural History of the furred and 
feathered creatures which are shot or otherwise 
taken ; and, so far as the Editor is aware, in no 
book hitherto published on Natural History or 
Sport has information been given as to the best 
methods of turning the contents of the bag to 
account. 






vi PREFACE 

Each volume of the present Series will, 
therefore, be devoted to a bird or beast, and 
will be divided into three parts. The Natural 
History of the species will first be given ; it 
will then be considered from the point of view 
of sport ; and the writer of the third division 
will assume that the creature has been carried 
to the larder, and will proceed to discuss it gas- 
tronomically. The origin of the animals will 
be traced, their birth and breeding described, 
every known method of circumventing and 
killing them not omitting the methods em- 
ployed by the poacher will be explained with 
special regard to modern developments, and 
they will only be left when on the table in the 
most appetising forms which the delicate science 
of cookery has discovered. 

It is intended to make the illustrations a 
prominent feature of the Series. The pictures 
in the present volume are after drawings by 
Mr. A. J. Stuart-Wortley and Mr. A. Thor- 
burn. All .of them, including the diagrams, 
have been designed under the supervision of 
the first-named.

NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

BY THE 

REV. H. A. MACPHERSON 






CHAPTER I 

IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 

IT is hardly too much to say that the Red Grouse 
enjoys a unique position among the members of the 
feathered community. Certainly no other bird exacts 
a similar amount of homage from its admirers, or 
affords as large a share of enjoyment to sportsmen. 
In these days of increasing taxation, it would go hard 
with many of us Highland lairds if we had no grouse 
moors from which to draw the rates which go to 
support school boards and other luxuries exacted by 
the oppressive democracy. Scotland is pre-eminently 
the home of this splendid bird a fact to which she 
owes a very large portion of her material prosperity. 
It was a happy hour when the Sassenach discovered 
the pleasure to be gained from renting a Northern 
grouse moor. 

Until then the bird had existed only on sufferance, 
persecuted by many enemies and little cared for by 
anyone. It is true that its value as food was always 



4 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

recognised ; but that circumstance only led to its 
increased pursuit in the days when Englishmen killed 
the ' pootes ' as well as the parent bird in the nesting 
season. Happily those evil days have well-nigh passed 
into oblivion. For us moderns the name of grouse 
has a fragrance of its own. Its bare mention suffices 
to set us dreaming of the fresh, breezy hillside, with 
its varied animal life and endless expanse of purple 
heather. Considering how widely the term grouse 
circulates, there is a certain quaintness in the fact 
that the word is not a British one at all,. but only an 
addition to our language and of doubtful origin. 
Our forefathers borrowed the word from abroad, 
apparently from an old French adjective grieschc, 
signifying grey or speckled. From this originated a 
plural word grice, printed thus in 1 6 1 1 by Cotgrave, 
who used it to denote the ' moor-henne,' the female, 
as he tells us, of the ' mooregame.' The grouse was 
originally the moor-fowl, moor-game, moor-cock, or 
muir-fowl, and preserves these titles at the present 
day in many districts of both England and Scotland. 
Willughby called it the red game, and very properly. 
But the plural word grice was early modified into the 
singular grows. Professor Newton has shown that this 
title was first applied to the blackcock, notably in an 
ordinance for the household of Henry VIII., dated 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 5 

from Eltham in the year 1531. Similarly, Charleton 
tells us that two species of the heath-cock or grouss 
are indigenous to Great Britain respectively entitled 
the black game and the grey game. In course of time 
the name grouse, very variously spelt, has, curiously 
enough, come to be applied to the red grouse 
almost exclusively. It may be well to mention that 
some scholars have sought a derivation of grouse in 
the Celtic terms grug= heather and -iar=a hen ; but 
the suggestion has not met with favour. If the origin 
of grouse, however, be somewhat perplexing and I 
for one should be very thankful for further light upon 
the subject it must be allowed that the origin of an- 
other name of the species is still more mysterious. I 
allude to the name gor-cock, which appears to have 
latterly dropped out of use, but which was formerly 
much in vogue both south and north of the Border. 
Professor Newton assures me that he has no clue to 
the etymology of this term, though he thinks it may 
have some connection with the harsh cry of the bird. 
My own belief is that it signifies red-cock, like the 
Gaelic 'Coilleach Ruadh,' referring to the reddish 
plumage of the typical bird. This view has not 
obtained the support of scholars ; but it is borne out 
by the fact that it was current in the seventeenth 
century. Thus Ray writes : ' The Red Game, Lagopus 



6 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

altera Plinii, an Attagen Aldrov. In the north of 
England it is called the Gor-cock and Moor-cock, the 
hen the More-hen, the brood Gorfoivl. Heath-cock is 
also a name common to this with the precedent. 
Turner's More-hen is the female of the precedent or 
Blackcock. Gor in the north of England signifies red, 
so the Gor- Cock is the red cock, &c. For the under- 
standing and exact distinctions of these names we 
are beholden to Mr. Johnson, of Brignal, in Yorke- 
shire.' J 

The prefix ' gor ' has been applied to some other 
birds, notably to the great black-backed gull and to 
the carrion crow. The fishermen of the Solway Firth 
often speak of the great black-backed gull as the ' gor 
maw.' In Oxfordshire, as Mr. O. V. Aplin tells us, 
the carrion crow is still recognised as a ' gor-crow.' 
The syllable ' gor ' seems in these two instances to be 
identical with the Saxon gor (carrion, or refuse), and 
to refer to the fact that both the black-backed gull and 
carrion crow feed upon carrion. Of the appropriate- 
ness of the prefix in these cases there can be no 
question. The gull preys habitually upon such fowl 
as escape wounded from the wildfowler, and often 
attacks a sickly lamb. The carrion crow is equally a 
foul feeder. But with regard to grouse, I think that

IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 



1 gor ' must refer to the red plumage of the bird, when- 
soever it may have been imported. 

Macgillivray was fond of coining new names for 
English birds, and he thought the grouse should be 
designated the red ptarmigan. The Gaelic names 
usually applied to this species are Coilleach Fraoich= 
the heather-cock, and Cearc Fhraoich=the heather- 
hen. It is also called Ian Fraoich=the heather-bird. 
The term most employed, at any rate in Skye, is the 
Cearc Fhraoich. 

The red grouse is not limited in its distribution 
to the mainland of Scotland. Wherever the common 
ling or heather grows most rapidly and richly, there 
grouse naturally most abound. The islands of 
Scotland are generally inferior to the mainland as 
regards their properties for growing heather in the 
dense profusion which the grouse loves to find. In 
Skye, for instance, the birds are scattered over a wider 
area than on a good Perthshire moor ; in other words, 
they have to range more widely in search of food. 
Of course, we can assist nature considerably by infus- 
ing fresh blood into our insular races. I have not 
tried turning down birds in Skye for more than two 
seasons, and cannot, therefore, speak of, with certainty, 
local results ; but I am assured that the introduction 
of Yorkshire grouse into Rum has greatly increased 



8 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



the bags obtained on that magnificent island. Messrs. 
Harvie Brown and Buckley describe the grouse of the 
Lews as deteriorating in size, and as tending to die 
out, for which they specially blame in-breeding, an 
evil easily remedied, if desired. I believe, myself, that 
the fault lies in the want of zeal of the proprietors, 
who allow enormous numbers of hooded crows to 
exist and to plunder their moors. In Skye we per- 
sistently trap and poison these arch robbers, but we 
cannot get entirely rid of them, because a fresh 
supply is always forthcoming from the Long Island. 
Farther north, there are plenty of grouse in the 
Orkneys, not upon all the islands of the group, but 
upon the majority viz. on the mainland, Hoy, Burray, 
Flotta, Fara, Risa Little, Cava, Eday and Rousay. 
Stragglers occasionally visit the other islands in the 
autumn and winter months. But there are no grouse 
in the Shetlands. There never were any there until 
they were introduced. Their first introduction must 
date back two hundred years, since Brand tells us, in 
1701, 'that grouse had previously been introduced into 
Shetland, but could not live there. They were 
numerous even then in Orkney, and the Fair Island 
peregrines used to visit Orkney to procure the moor-fowl 
as food for their young. Of late years, several efforts 
have been made to naturalise grouse in Shetland ; but 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 



the experiments appear to have been conducted care- 
lessly, and have, so far, proved useless. It was about 
the year 1870 that Mr. D. D. Black, of Kergord, 
endeavoured to establish grouse at the head of 
Weisdale Voe. A quantity of trees were planted at 
the same time to afford shelter to the birds ; but the 
situation did not suit the Norway firs, and they con- 
sequently perished. At last one pair of grouse nested, 
however, because three young birds were caught upon 
Sandness Hill by a woman who carried them to Dr. 
Scott, of Melmby. In 1882, Mr. John Harrison of 
Windhouse, in Yell, procured upwards of forty grouse 
from Scotland for the purpose of turning down ; but, 
unhappily, almost all the consignment perished on 
the way, and only a single pair of birds was set free at 
their destination. These birds nested, and were joined 
in 1885 by five additional pairs. They lingered for some 
time on Yell, and tenanted the island in 1890. In Unst 
a female grouse nested in 1886, but the eggs proved 
unfertile, and the species became locally extinct. Mr. 
Harold Raeburn, to whom I am indebted for my present 
information, considers that there is no reason why 
grouse should not become perfectly well established 
in Shetland, if sufficient trouble were bestowed upon 
the experiment. The birds would have to face some 
drawbacks here as elsewhere ; e.g. the dense popula- 



io NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



tion, the wet and stormy springs, and the sinful 
custom of burning heather all over instead of in suit- 
able strips. Another difficulty in Shetland, as in 
very many places, is the great abundance of the 
hooded crow and other vermin. Mr. Raeburn thinks 
that the peninsula of Roness on the mainland would 
suit grouse particularly well. What is required, if 
grouse are to become naturalised in Shetland, is the 
united effort of the various proprietors, who should 
join together in extirpating vermin, and turn down 
some hundreds of grouse for two or three successive 
seasons. I have no great faith, myself, in the virtue 
of experiments carried out on a small scale ; because 
introduced grouse would have, in the first instance, to 
fight stoutly for existence. 

On the other hand, a well-considered scheme, 
accompanied by remedial measures for the protection 
of heather, would probably result in material benefit 
to the Northern Isles. Upon the Scottish mainland 
the grouse enjoys a general distribution, ranging freely 
over elevated moorlands as well as those situated in 
low-lying districts. A wonderful region of Scotland is 
that which lies between the high mountains and the 
western seas, bathed in a flood of thin mist or de- 
corated with a variety of soft and soothing tints, 
marvellous reds and browns and greys mingling to- 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 



gether in glorious harmony. To lie upon an open 
shelf of rock, from which the sun has newly drawn 
the early dew, to listen silently, and drink in at leisure, 
all unnoticed, the cries of the wild population that 
hold their own among the pathless hills, this for the 
naturalist is a feast of intellect. Now it is an old male 
capercailzie whose fine bold form appears suddenly 
upon the scene, as he speeds through the top of a 
cluster of Scotch firs, having been rudely startled from 
his favourite perch by some passer-by. Anon, a restless 
curlew sweeps into the field of the binoculars, and pro- 
ceeds to wheel in agitation above the rushy ground in 
which her progeny are skulking, quaint little downy 
morsels with their curious, straightened bills. A wary old 
blackcock comes speeding along the hill in full view 
of us, and a skein of wild duck appear circling over- 
head, wheeling round and round at a vast height from 
the earth. If we lingered a few minutes longer, we 
should surely be visited by a blue merlin, or, perhaps, 
a tercel might favour us with a morning call. Much 
of the charm with which the hills are invested is due 
to the delicious uncertainty as to what we may or may 
not meet with among the rocks and heather of the 
lonelier glens ; and I, for one, am obliged to confess 
that our national scenery exercises a stronger spell 
over my imagination than the beauties of Switzerland 



12 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

or the gloomy grandeur of the fiords of Western Nor- 
way. The grouse is pre-eminently bound up with our 
happiest memories of home scenery. Of course, the 
wealthy men among us can go to Spitzbergen and 
enjoy good sport with a form of ptarmigan which Mr. 
Abel Chapman considers to be almost identical with 
the red grouse ; or they may visit Northern Europe 
and kill willow grouse to their heart's content ; but 
the grouse holds a unique position in the affections of 
most British sportsmen ; all the more, perhaps, since 
it is essentially an insular production, and cannot be 
met with out of Great Britain and Ireland, except, 
indeed, under certain artificial conditions. 

I do not know anything of Irish moors at first 
hand, never having visited Ireland ; but the north of 
England affords as fine a race of grouse as can be 
found anywhere in the Northern kingdom. The Pen- 
nine range, especially, with its infinite number of out- 
lying spurs, affords an enormous area for grouse to 
range over, and possesses the advantage of being 
near to the metropolis. Many quiet nooks of exquisite 
beauty are to be found among the grouse moors of 
Yorkshire and of Westmoreland. Farther south, the 
grouse manages to exist in close proximity to some of 
the grimy manufacturing towns of Lancashire. The 
account of the habits of the red arouse furnished 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 13 



by Mr. Seebohm to Dresser's ' Birds of Europe ' was 
based upon his study of the species in Derbyshire. 
Farther south than this it seems useless to look for 
grouse, unless we turn aside into little Wales, which is 
not famous for the quality of bags obtained upon the 
Twelfth, though the species appears to exist in most 
suitable places in the Principality. It would be a 
mistake, however, to suppose that the grouse cannot 
thrive at a distance from the great lonely moorlands 
which constitute its natural home. I believe that the 
species could be naturalised in any part of Britain, 
provided the conditions of life proved suitable. The 
experiments that have been made in Norfolk, although 
carried out on a small scale, are full of encouragement. 
Mr. J. H. Gurney tells me that Mr. J. Hardcastle 
turned some grouse out on Holt Heath nearly twenty 
years ago, but that they have long since vanished. 
Better results have been obtained at Sandringham. 
' Some fourteen years ago,' writes Mr. Jackson, the 
head keeper, 'thirty brace were turned down, and 
the following year another thirty brace. The experi- 
ment was not made with a view to add to the shooting, 
but for the pleasure of hearing and seeing the birds on 
the estate. I found that they nested and reared their 
young quite satisfactorily, but that they decreased in 
number between the breeding seasons a fact which 



14 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

was doubtless due to their straying off our ground. 
They have an area of about 1,200 or 1,500 acres of 
heather, which is for the most part surrounded by 
grazing land. The stock is now reduced to about 
eight or ten brace.' It must be the wish of all good 
sportsmen to see such experiments as that just de- 
scribed meet with an enlarged success. We do not 
take as much pains to improve our sport at home as 
we might. I wonder, for example, that landowners 
do not unite to turn down gadwall and other fowl all 
over the country, and thus convert our ponds and 
rivers into a national preserve of wildfowl. There are 
thousands of places that would hold a brace of teal or 
a few pairs of pintail, if only they were planted with 
large beds of rushes and well preserved. As for the 
grouse, its good qualities have begun to attract atten- 
tion among our Continental neighbours. The pioneer 
was Baron Dickson, who established red grouse in 
Sweden between twenty and thirty years ago. It is 
now reported that the Belgian Government intends to 
people the sandy heaths of that country with drafts of 
red grouse. 

Already the example of Baron Dickson has been 
emulated by Count Kniphausen, who owns a property 
in East Friesland, and has given the following account 
of his experiment : ' In the autumn of 1891 I ordered 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 



from a game dealer in England five pairs of live grouse 
for my game preserves near Wittmund in East Fries- 
land, as an experiment in the way of naturalising this 
foreign game bird with us. My prospects regarding 
this attempt did not appear to me unpromising, as I 
could offer the birds on my sporting domain freedom 
from disturbance, plenty of water, heather, and various 
berry-bearing plants, and patches of buckwheat, to 
all of which these birds are said to be partial. The 
grouse were transported across the North Sea in 
November. They were sent from Scotland via London 
and Flushing, the consequence of which was that, by 
reason of the long railway journeys, the birds suffered 
very much, and succumbed, chiefly, I fear, from want 
of water at any rate, I only received one pair alive 
on their arrival at their destination. I had taken pains 
beforehand to erect for them, in a thicket, an aviary 
of wire netting, with canvas overhead, provided plenti- 
fully with water and buckwheat, and with the wire 
netting stuck full of sprigs of heather, partly so that 
they might feel themselves more hidden, but chiefly 
because I understand that heather tops are their chief 
source of nourishment. After a few days' rest I had 
one of the sides of the inclosure raised, so that the 
grouse might go out of their own accord. In the 
spring of 1893 I was rewarded by coming across the 



1 6 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

cock grouse in the company of a blackcock on my 
preserve, and had the pleasure, of listening to his call. 
It also came to my knowledge that the hen was alive, 
and that she had incubated for about fourteen days, 
though too late in the year, for it was during the 
harvesting of the buckwheat that she was disturbed 
by the mowers. The cock and hen both flew away, 
and the hen, alas ! never sought her nest again, The 
eggs, fourteen in number, I have preserved. This 
delightful discovery, that a pair of grouse had lived 
all but two years on my property, and had even made 
a good attempt to rear a brood, made me resolve to 
go on with my experiments. The dealer to whom I 
addressed myself undertook, for twenty marks the 
pair, to deliver ten brace of grouse to me ; and we 
came to an understanding that he should send them 
at my cost from Hull to Bremen, that he should 
undertake their being carefully secured in boxes made 
expressly for the purpose, and that he should not be 
bound to make good any losses that might occur. 
Messrs. Weltmann, in Hull, who forward goods for 
the North German Lloyd's Company, kindly under- 
took the delivery of them, and promised to see that 
they did not want for food or water on their thirty 
hours' sea voyage; and thus, to my joy, my gamekeeper, 
whom I had sent to Bremen to fetch the birds, was 



IN PXAISE OF THE GKOUSE 17 

enabled to deliver to me the whole lot of seven brace 
(more were not to be had at the time). 

' The birds this time flew strongly when let out in 
their inclosure, but did not hurt themselves, owing 
to the canvas spread over the top. My sporting 
neighbours all belong to the Prussian and Oldenburg 
Forest and Moor Game Preservation Societies, to 
both of which I successfully applied, and they have, 
as before on the introduction of black-game, promised 
that for some years to come the protection of these 
grouse shall be looked upon by them as a strict duty. 
So it is to be hoped that this attempt to naturalise 
them in the plains of North- West Germany may suc- 
ceed, as it did with the black-game, which had for 
many a long year been extinct there.' 

And here I may remark that, as the red grouse is 
systematically netted in large numbers in the north of 
England, it should be easy enough for any of our 
Continental neighbours to repeat the experiment just 
described on a larger scale. Any such endeavour to 
naturalise the red grouse abroad should be extended 
over several seasons, and care should be taken to 
supply an adequate number of female birds. The 
latter are rather less hardy than the opposite sex, and 
are consequently more liable to perish on the journey 
than their male companions. 



i8 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



It has been suggested that the eggs of the grouse 
could be exported to other countries. No doubt 
Count Kniphausen might very well have tried the 
experiment of introducing grouse eggs into the nests 
of greyhens. The eggs could be obtained in York- 
shire, and carried by water to their destination without 
incurring much risk. But very few sportsmen would 
allow eggs to be lifted on their moors, and any traf- 
ficking in the eggs of game birds gives an unfortunate 
stimulus to poaching practices. On the other hand, 
live grouse might safely be sent very long distances if 
packed in roomy cages and not overcrowded. The 
tops of the cages should be lined with canvas, so that 
the birds could not injure their heads by flying up- 
wards. I remember a charming sand grouse which 
became extremely domesticated and familiar with the 
members of the household to which it belonged. It 
was fearful, however, of strangers, and when alarmed 
the poor bird almost always started upwards and 
struck the wooden roof of the cage. I mention this 
practical point, because I have found by experience 
that, obvious as it seems to be, it is in fact generally 
disregarded by those persons who send live grouse 
about the country. I feel sure that its recognition 
would materially reduce the risks of travelling. 



CHAPTER II 

THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 

THE anxious time for those of us who happen to 
possess moors, or even to have leased those of others, 
arrives in the spring of the year, when the grouse, that 
have long since paired off with their respective mates, 
begin to occupy their stations for the summer and to 
go to nest. Without wishing to dogmatise too nicely, 
it is fair to say that almost every bird upon the moor 
occupies its peculiar station for many successive 
years, unless, of course, interfered with by human 
agency. It has been said, for example, that if an 
ornithologist wishes to explore any district in Lap- 
land in search of the eggs of the rarer species, he 
should spend the time of a preliminary expedition in 
marking down the precise situations which each pair 
of any one species choose to occupy. We can all of 
us see the force of this remark even at home. Season 
after season witnesses to the faithfulness with which 
the curlew and its mate return to a long and desolate 

c 2 



20 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

strip of broken moorland lying under the shadow of 
the Coolin Hills ; the eggs are almost always laid 
about the same spot, and generation after generation 
of downy chicks enter into existence on the same 
patch of heather and rough grass. It is the same 
with the ptarmigan that nestles up in the lonely 
corrie above Sligachan. I have seen the nests of 
two seasons placed side by side on a slope of green 
turf, screened from observation by the same con- 
venient boulders of rock. Indeed, I could tell you 
where to find the nest of the greenshank and many 
another rare bird, knowing from long intimacy with 
their haunts precisely the positions that these birds 
are likely to occupy in successive seasons. This 
principle applies as truly to the red grouse as to 
other birds, making allowance for the destruction of 
old females in the shooting season. On my own 
ground, at any rate, I have a very good idea where 
to look for grouse nests, although I never search for 
them intentionally, but only stumble upon them inci- 
dentally. No good sportsman would wish to organise 
a hunt for grouse nests. The grouse is a very par- 
ticular bird, and often deserts her eggs if suddenly 
startled from her charge. Of course, there are many 
hen grouse which would rather allow themselves to be 
trodden upon than leave their eggs, and their faithful- 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 



ness to maternal duties is touching in its way. But 
the grouse is naturally a shy, timid creature, and will 
not willingly brook much interference. A grouse 
moor can hardly be kept too quiet in the breeding 
season. That is the reason why proprietors object so 
strongly to the intrusion of parties of tourists being 
forced upon them by any Radical legislation. Strangers 
do not, of course, intend the least in the world to do 
us any harm, but in point of fact they are pretty cer- 
tain to scare some birds badly, and thus to diminish 
the supply of chicks hatched out. Some people may 
suggest that grouse breed so very early that the young 
are hatched long before the tourist season. The 
grouse is an early breeding bird in the north of 
England, and often begins to lay eggs during the 
month of March if the season happens to be warm 
and genial. In the north of Scotland incubation is 
much later. In the island of Skye, April 24 is a de- 
cidedly early date for a full clutch of grouse eggs. 

May and June are the two months in which the 
majority of grouse hens go to nest. Although most 
of us have accustomed ourselves to speak of grouse 
nests, the expression is hardly exact, for the eggs are 
deposited in a mere scratching, scantily lined with a 
few dry stems of grass or twigs of heather. Some of 
the text-books, it is true, speak of feathers being used 



22 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



to line the nests of grouse, but I believe that any 
feathers found in a grouse's nest have been accident- 
ally dropped by the old bird. The nest is very often 
placed near a little burn, generally under the shelter 
of a tuft of heather. I have occasionally seen per- 
fectly open nests, but they are very liable to be 
flooded. The grouse is one of the hardiest birds in 
existence, and frequently continues to sit upon her eggs 
after the nest has filled with water ; but the eggs are 
delicate, and are generally addled by such unfortunate 
immersion, notwithstanding the devotion exhibited 
by the old hen. It is a fallacy to suppose that grouse 
like to nest in very old heather. As a matter of fact 
they prefer younger plants as cover, choosing to avail 
themselves of the shelter of well-grown but not really 
old ling. 

As to the number of eggs usually laid by grouse, 
my belief is that seven and eight are the numbers 
which occur most frequently Five is the smallest 
number that I have seen incubated, nor have I ever 
seen more than a dozen eggs in one nest. Indeed, to 
find more than ten eggs in a nest is quite an excep- 
tional event, although probably most sportsmen have 
at one time or another come across large coveys of 
young birds. It often happens, however, that one or 
more eggs prove unfertile. There are records of as 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 23 

many as seventeen eggs being found in a single grouse 
nest, but I imagine that two hen birds had laid together. 
Mr. Henry Seebohm is perhaps as high an authority 
upon the eggs of British birds as any member of the 
B.O.U. He says that he has not found much variation 
in the size of eggs of the grouse. ' The ground-colour 
of the eggs of the grouse is usually a pale olive, 
spotted and blotched all over with dark red-brown. 
The spots are frequently so confluent as almost to 
conceal the ground-colour. In fresh-laid eggs the 
brown is often very red, in some instances almost 
approaching crimson. It appears to darken as it 
thoroughly dries, and sometimes almost approaches 
black. When fresh laid the colour is not very fast, 
and before the eggs are hatched the beauty of the 
original colouring is generally very much lessened by 
large spots coming off altogether, no doubt from the 
friction of the feathers when the bird is sitting. If 
the weather is wet when the bird begins to sit this is 
much more the case. When the colour has once 
become thoroughly dry it will bear washing in water 
without injury. The colour of the eggs is admirably 
adapted for the purpose of concealment from the 
prying eyes of rooks, crows, and birds of prey, being 
very much like the mixture of moss, lichens, and peat 
where they are laid. Most of the eggs laid come to 



24 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

maturity. I once asked a gamekeeper to watch half 
a dozen nests which were near his house. He told 
me that out of forty-nine eggs, he counted forty-seven 
chicken grouse. As soon as the young are hatched, 
especially in dry seasons, the hen takes her brood 
down to the more swampy parts of the moor.' It will 
be obvious to most people that the proportion of eggs 
that hatch out depends very much on the rainfall. 
Still more does this affect the tiny grouse during the 
first few days of their existence. If the weather is 
dry and sunny, the little fellows grow rapidly and soon 
become fairly independent, learning to peck at small 
caterpillars, flies, and other insects. If heavy showers 
of rain arrive at the critical time the number of young 
grouse that perish is often very considerable, for, hardy 
as they eventually become, they are extremely tender 
during the first days of their existence. Gradually 
the cheepers grow stronger, and learn to forage on 
their own account. They do best in fairly dry seasons, 
provided always that they have a good supply of water 
easily accessible. Should this be scarce, the chicks 
are sadly liable to seek to satisfy their thirst in deep 
ditches and drains, out of which they cannot easily 
make their escape. 

Of course it is impossible to guard against such 
misfortunes. Happily the hen grouse is a careful 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 25 

parent ; indeed, both the male and female birds take 
every care of their young broods. 

The grouse depends chiefly upon heather for its 
subsistence, feeding on the common ling (Calluna 
vulgaris) and also on the fine-leaved heath (Erica 
rinerea), breaking off the fresh tips of the twigs, which 
are reduced to pulp by the action of the gizzard, 
assisted by fine fragments of quartz and pebbles intro- 
duced for the purpose of aiding the action of the latter 
in comminuting the food. Grouse are partial to 
the berries of both the bilberry and cranberry. 
Clover leaves have also an attraction for them. 
Occasionally they eat the polypody, of which the 
pheasant is also fond. In severe weather grouse 
find that even hips help to support existence. Joseph 
Walton of Garrigill tells me that very small grouse 
feed eagerly on caterpillars, a fact which he has verified 
by dissection. 

In the fall of the year grouse often shift their 
quarters from the tops of the hills, in order to feast 
upon the stocks of oats upon the shepherd's croft or 
the minister's glebe. Some birds take very kindly to 
the stubble. In some parts of Perthshire it is quite a 
common event to find a covey of grouse haunting a 
favourite field for many successive weeks, and the 
birds grow heavy upon the diet they thus obtain, 



26 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

though they are considered rather to deteriorate in 
flavour. It is this readiness to feed upon grain which 
makes it possible to keep grouse in confinement, or at 
any rate in a state of semi-captivity. Some few years 
ago, when the sand grouse were visiting England, I was 
told one day that a sand grouse in the possession 
of a neighbour had nested and laid some eggs. On 
inquiry we found that the bird, which had nested in 
the house of its owner, was a tame red grouse, which 
had voluntarily begun to incubate. No instance of 
the grouse rearing its young in captivity has come 
under my notice hitherto, although some half-dozen 
records of the fact appear to be authenticated. The 
late Mr. Osborne, for example, kept a number of 
grouse in confinement for several years, and on one 
occasion a pair bred and hatched out five healthy 
chicks. Their owner used to walk many miles from 
Wick to fetch the tender heather shoots for the old 
and young grouse which had hatched out within his 
walls in the town. 1 

It is remarkable that so shy and retiring a bird 
as the red grouse should become extremely bold and 
adventurous under artificial conditions, yet of this 
there can be no possible doubt. Mr. W. Oxenden 
Hammond tells us of a red grouse which was taken to 
1 Fauna of Sutherland and CaitJmess, p. 205. 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 27 



Kent from a Yorkshire moor, and lived for several 
years in a cage in the hall of a country house. ' This 
was an old cock bird, and its constant call in the 
morning used to echo through the house.' ' A pleas- 
ing description of the tameness of a covey of grouse 
was contributed to the ' Field ' of February 5, 1887, by 
a correspondent who signed his article with the letter 
' X.' ' Now the history of these tame birds is as 
follows : A friend of mine one who delights in all 
matters relating to the habits of wild birds, and, what 
is more, is thoroughly versed in the subject had a 
nest of grouse eggs hatched out under a hen this on 
the same ground where his young pheasants were 
being reared. When first out of the egg the young 
grouse showed a disposition to stray somewhat too 
far from the maternal coop ; but this little difficulty 
was easily overcome by the intelligent keeper. At 
some distance a wire netting was placed round the 
coop. In a very short time this was removed ; 
but to show the result of habit and training on 
birds, it was found that the young ones circled round 
much about the place where the wire netting had 
stood. 

' Time went on, and they soon settled into the 
habits of their pheasant companions. Some six or

28 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



seven grew up, and about October the cock birds seem 
to have made advances to the hens, and their overtures 
doubtless being taken by the latter as inopportune out 
of season they modestly levanted. There remained 
three cocks, all in splendid plumage and condition, 
feeding, be it remembered, entirely on pheasants' food 
and what they could pick up about the house. One of 
the birds remained in the corner of the field where 
the coop had stood, taking possession of it for himself. 
Here at all times he was to be seen ready to dispute 
his ground with anyone passing near it. Usually he 
challenged with a call, and then, if approached, he 
was ready either for a fight or to be fed, or both any- 
thing that suited the whim of the intruder. One day, 
when I was giving some maize to my friend, the keeper 
came up, and going on all fours, began throwing grass 
in the face of the bird. At once the grouse responded 
to the challenge by flying at him, coming up sideways, 
and using his spurs. The bird allowed itself repeatedly 
to be caught, and the moment he was liberated re- 
turned again and again to the unequal combat. More 
than once have I seen this same bird fly across from 
his corner and join us when shooting on the opposite 
woodland bank, this being some 600 or 700 yards 
across a narrow neck of sea at the head of a loch. 
My friend's dogs retrievers and spaniels knew the 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 29 

bird well, and paid no attention to him, nor did he to 
the shots that were fired close to him. But not so my 
retriever. He began by thinking it was his manifest 
duty to bring the bird to me ; but, on being duly 
warned, and on seeing the grouse trying to get to close 
quarters to ram him, so to speak, with his spurs, a 
feeling of alarm, droll to see, came over the dog. 
Evidently he concluded he had to deal with some- 
thing quite new to him, possibly a demented grouse. 
Another day I fell in with my friend a mile from this 
spot, and having two dogs with me, it was as much as 
I could do to beat a hasty retreat into a thick wood, 
so anxious was he to have a sparring match with one 
or other of the dogs. 

' This bird has now taken up his quarters close to a 
house, a mile from the place he was reared, remaining 
just as tame, and coming regularly for his breakfast. 
The two others remain about the lodge, in the court- 
yard, in the garden, and frequently come in at the 
servants' dinner-time to pick up anything that may be 
thrown to them. They have induced one wild bird 
to come down off the moor, and this bird is now 
fairly tame that is to say, he will let one get within a 
few yards of him. When, by the way, it pleased 
Master Grouse to join us out shooting, if by chance a 
spaniel came suddenly upon him, he was not in the 



30 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



least degree disconcerted he would simply fly on to 
a rock, and begin crowing at the dog.' 

While the willow grouse is well known to be fond 
of perching in trees, its British congener rarely alights 
even on a bush except when forced by hunger to feed 
on hips in snowy weather. Mr. J. G. Millais gives a 
charming account of a Westmoreland grouse which 
was hatched and reared by a little bantam. ' Every 
evening the bantam used to repair to a large beech 
tree near the house, in which she was in the habit of 
roosting when unencumbered by family cares. So 
when she was allowed to remain out for the night her 
first thought was to make for her old perch, to which 
she considered the youngster was perfectly capable of 
following, as he could now fly well. The latter, after 
many ineffectual attempts to keep on his legs, was 
forced to sleep on the ground at the foot of the tree, 
for though he managed to get up to the perch, his 
efforts to keep there were quite useless, as he always 
fell off again, either backwards or forwards. How- 
ever, in the course of time practice made perfect, and 
he acquired such a liking for sitting on the trees that 
he was often afterwards seen in the daytime flying 
from branch to branch, appearing to be perfectly at 
home.' Mr. Millais adds that this grouse ' had a par- 
ticular affection for the lawn-tennis court, and when- 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 31 

ever any of the members of my friend's family began 
to play, Mr. Grouse would always put in an appear- 
ance, seeming to enjoy the fact that he was an 
obstructionist, and refusing to clear off unless forcibly 
removed and shut up in his pen. If taken to the 
other end of the grounds he would almost imme- 
diately return to the tennis court. Such was the soci- 
ability of his disposition that he had absolutely no 
sense of fear at the report of firearms ; in fact, he 
would frequently follow the shooters out to a distance 
of several fields from the house before he would 
return home, satisfied that they had taken their 
departure for the whole day, so that it would be of 
no use accompanying them. Every night, before 
retiring to roost in his beech tree, he would take long 
flights round and round the house and village, which 
was close by ; and in the course of one of his evening 
rambles he espied an old man digging, from whom 
he very naturally expected he would obtain some 
delicacy, as everyone was in the habit of giving him 
something to eat ; but this old scoundrel was a 
stranger, and barbarously despatched the confiding 
bird with his spade.' l Mr. Millais mentions another 
tame grouse, which lived for a long time at Guisachan, 
Lord Tweedmouth's place in Ross-shire. ' After 
1 Game Birds and Shooting Sketches^ p. 50. 



32 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

being kept for several years, he departed as usual in 
spring to the hills, where he annually assisted in the 
increase of the stock, but did not return to the house, 
as was his wont, during the following winter. He 
feared neither man nor beast, and became great 
friends with a certain dog in the house, on whose 
back he used often to ride. The following instance 
of his plucky disposition was related to me on sepa- 
rate occasions by each of the two guns who were 
present when the affair occurred. A shooting party 
were beating the hillside near the house, when a 
pointer that was working stood to birds, which even- 
tually rose, and some were killed ; but as the dog still 
held, they correctly inferred that there was probably 
another bird left, which proved to be the case. This 
happened to be the tame grouse, whose presence was 
quite unexpected, and who considered being pointed 
such an insult that when the unfortunate dog ap- 
proached near enough to be disagreeable, he flew up 
and attacked it so blindly that he was with difficulty 
rescued from its jaws.' 

Cock grouse, in spite of their general shyness, are 
very pugnacious birds, and the old males especially 
show great intolerance of any strangers that venture 
to intrude upon what they consider their own proper 
domain. A Perthshire keeper tells me that he saw 



33 



two male grouse engaged in combat ; so completely 
blinded with fury were the birds that they dashed 
against the wall of a stone building, one of them kill- 
ing himself with the impetuosity of his flight. 

Individuals of the male sex appear to predominate 
in most birds, and I have no doubt myself as to the 
desirability of sportsmen endeavouring to shoot the 
male birds hard. Not only do more male birds reach 
maturity, but the females are exposed to additional 
risks in the breeding season. Mr. D. J. Lamb states 
that, out of 130 grouse killed near Pitlochry in four 
days in 1893, as many as 120 were cock birds. 1 
This, of course, is an exceptional incident, but it 
points the moral that cock birds should not be 
allowed to live unpaired. Otherwise they disturb 
the breeding couples, and become a nuisance to 
the grouse moor. Of course, birds behave very 
diversely in different parts of the country. With 
us in Skye the family parties live together in peace 
and tranquillity until November, and rarely pack 
before the end of that month. If they pack in 
November it is generally in consequence of bad 
weather. On the other hand, the grouse of the 
north of England pack, as a general rule, early in 
the season, and the sexes usually separate. Every

34 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

sportsman knows that the old cock birds often lie 
out singly in the heather on the tops of the hills, 
while the females and younger males are shifting in 
flocks about the lower ground. 

I have gradually been led to the opinion that the 
custom of driving the moors has altered the habits 
of grouse enormously, and led to their becoming 
far more gregarious than they used to be. The men- 
tion of grouse driving always reminds me of a remark 
which was made in my presence some few years 
ago. A certain man was descanting rather loudly on 
the excellence of his shooting, when Sir Reginald 
Cathcart inquired whether the drives were good. The 
reply was somewhat unexpected : ' Well, the fact is, 
we have not any drives yet, but I am having them 
laid out.' Our grouse in Skye never become very 
wild. Their tameness in December is often more 
openly expressed than in the breeding season. Of 
course, nesting grouse will allow you to tread upon 
them in the heather rather than rise from their place 
of concealment, and it is necessary to take a dog to 
the hill if you wish to form an estimate of the number 
of birds upon the moor in the month of May. A hen 
that is nesting in an open situation will generally 
dash away in trepidation if she thinks herself detected ; 
but most birds nest in cover, and greatly prefer to 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 35 



watch your movements while resting snugly concealed 
than to court your notice by any hasty action that 
might betray the safety of their treasures. Their 
habits become modified, however, when the young 
have hatched out. For example, if you happen to 
cross a bit of mossy ground on a July day you are 
sure to flush an old hen grouse, which sings out lustily 
as she rises from the heather. The dog makes a 
point, and lo ! a newly feathered youngster is crouch- 
ing at your feet, watching all your movements with 
a keen glance of its bright dark eyes. You pause for 
a moment to admire the little fellow's yellow freckled 
garb ; it harmonises nicely with the rough cover in 
which the creature is nestling. The instinct with 
which it accepts an impassive position, as offering the 
best hope of safety, is truly marvellous. The old hen 
will not leave her young ; another step forward, and 
you flush four or five more young birds, which start 
up with their plaintive cheeping cry, to fly a few 
paces across the moor before they drop back into 
cover. The anxiety of the old birds is often touching 
in its disinterestedness, especially if the young are 
newly hatched, in which case the mother birds worm 
this way and that way along the ground, trailing 
themselves through the heather with half-open wings, 
hoping by this transparent device to lead you away

36 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

from their tender charge. Grouse are good parents, 
full of solicitude for their young, and will endure any 
danger rather than allow their chicks to be injured. 
Sometimes they succeed even in beating off the attack 
of the hooded crow, or that rascally marauder the 
female sparrow hawk. 

Grouse seem to me to thrive best upon moors of 
moderate elevation. The low-lying grounds suit them 
very well in winter, when snow and sleet have driven 
them down from the hills, and they will then fly long dis- 
tances. It is not at all unusual for red grouse to cross 
the Solway Firth at a point where the estuary measures 
two miles in breadth, and I have known them fly 
longer distances. They often cross the valley of the 
Tees, flying about a mile from one hillside to another. 
Mr. Millais observes that ' the usual length of a 
grouse's flight ranges from a quarter to three-quarters 
of a mile, depending entirely, of course, on the nature 
of the ground over which they are passing, being as a 
rule much shorter on heather flats, where they have 
numerous and agreeable resting places, than on broken 
ground and rocky hill places. In a discussion which 
took place in the " Field " I noticed that most sports- 
men were of opinion that grouse were incapable of 
flying four miles ; but I have twice seen grouse on the 
wing when they were crossing the "Bring," a wide 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 37 

channel which separates the islands of Hoy and 
Pomona, Orkneys. The fishermen told me this 
distance, at the point where I was sailing, was quite 
four miles across, and the birds must have come at 
least another mile on the Pomona side from the point 
where they left the moor.' 

Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown states that in December 
1879 a pack of grouse was seen flying south over 
the Moray Firth, making for the Banff coast. Their 
journey must have been very considerable. It is not 
easy, in fact, to say how far the grouse is migratory, 
but that individual birds wander far and wide in 
autumn and winter there can be no doubt. The Rev. 
M. A. Mathew records that a solitary red grouse 
was shot by Mr. C. Edwards on the Mendips, near 
Wrington, Somerset, in September 1885, and this, he 
suggests, must have crossed over the Bristol Channel, 
migrating from Breconshire. Very likely the bird was 
pursued by a peregrine, and the chase carried it far 
out of its usual latitude. Similarly, the red grouse 
included in Mr. Miller Christy's ' Birds of Essex ' had 
no doubt strayed from Sandringham, or from some 
other centre of introduction in Eastern England In 
1879 Mr. W. Stamper observed a pair of grouse in a 
turnip field on his farm near Oswaldkirk, Yorks, early 
in February. The birds had strayed at least ten miles 



38 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

from the nearest grouse moor. Severe weather often 
affects the interests of the grouse bred on high ground. 
Thus, Mr. James Carter writes that in January 1886 
the neighbourhood of Masham, Yorkshire, was covered 
to a considerable depth with snow, which, owing to 
sudden changes from thaw to frost, with frequent 
fresh falls of snow, became a very solid mass. The 
depth above the heather on the moors was consider- 
ably more than a foot, and large drifts formed on a 
very extensive scale. ' The grouse suffered severely, 
being quite unable to penetrate the frozen mass for 
food, and in consequence they left the moors for the 
lower cultivated land to an extent never previously 
observed. The nearest point of moor to Masham is 
three miles distant, but the open moors are considerably 
farther away. Walking near this ground, great packs 
of grouse would sweep overhead and pass right down 
the valley over the town. A field of turnips was 
swarming with the starving birds, which vainly at- 
tempted, with numerous partridges, to scratch down 
for food. The grouse were perched on the fences, 
feeding on the berries like so many fieldfares, and on 
several occasions they alighted amongst the branches 
of trees. They were feeding in the hedgerows about 
Durton House and close to the outskirts of the town, 
and even on the heaps of manure close to buildings 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 39 

where persons were working all day. As far as one 
could see they had abandoned the moors, and were 
feeding miles away in the cultivated districts on any- 
thing they could get in the way of food. A large 
farmer, whose land lies three miles still farther away 
from their usual haunts, states that immense flocks of 
grouse were feeding in his turnip fields. Gangs of 
men were being employed to clear away the snow from 
patches of heather, but their efforts did very little 
towards providing feeding ground for the vast number 
of starving birds.' l The Editor of the ' Zoologist ' 
appended to the communication just cited a note that, 
' About the time mentioned there was an extraordinary 
exodus of grouse from the moors in the neighbourhood 
of Ilkley, in consequence of the very inclement 
weather. The birds in many cases left the moorland 
altogether, and large packs were seen in the fields 
about Arthington and Weedon. . . . During a severe 
winter some years ago we remember to have heard 
that in Caithness the grouse were all down on the sea- 
shore^ and hardly a bird was to be found on the 
moors.' A large amount of similar evidence might 
be cited if it could serve any useful purpose, but the 
foregoing will suffice to show that not only do single 
pairs of grouse stray occasionally on to arable farms, 

1 Zoologist, 1886, p. 107. 



40 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

but that under certain conditions the majority of 
English grouse desert their favourite moors for a short 
period in order to satisfy the pangs of hunger. The 
question whether grouse are liable to migrate in 
the early spring, when food is apparently plentiful, 
suggests a more difficult problem. There are good 
sportsmen, at any rate, and careful field naturalists 
who incline to believe that the grouse, like its distant 
relative Pallas's sand grouse, is occasionally seized 
by paroxysms of migratory fever, under the influence 
of which the birds travel for many miles from their 
home moor. But positive proof that this is so is 
still wanting, and the question can only be settled 
by means of marked birds. 



CHAPTER III 

THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 

Tin: most important factor in grouse preserving is a 
judicious treatment of the heather which clothes the 
slopes of our northern hills. Of course many other 
points have to be considered. If we allow the moors 
to become overstocked, we increase the susceptibility 
of the game to the various forms of disease which 
have been so cleverly exploited by Dr. Klein and 
other scientific workers. But the vital question in 
the management of a grouse moor is the maintenance 
of a proper food supply. Grouse are hardy fowl, 
and can face wet seasons, not indeed with impunity, 
yet without seriously losing ground. They are well 
accustomed to meet the vicissitudes of our stormy 
and changeable climate. In droughty seasons they 
vary their diet with an additional share of blaeberries. 
Does the snow fall swiftly and thickly on the brae ? 
the grouse have long since learnt full well by experi- 
ence of hard times how to find the gullies where the 



42 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

snow will drift in eddies before the gusts of wind that 
drive with such precipitancy, and are sure to assemble 
in the places where they can get the best supply of 
food. If necessary, they can scratch off the snow that 
shrouds the food plant from their vision. But how if 
we neglect the culture of the food plant ? In that 
case our grouse must fail. Shepherds have done 
much to change the appearance of our Highland glens, 
and to bring about a complete metamorphosis in the 
conditions under which grouse live in many districts. 
An enormous increase in the number of sheep kept 
in Great Britain has destroyed, and is still destroying, 
a vast quantity of heather. This is all right up to a 
certain point. Vermin like old heather, but grouse 
do not. Young heather is very acceptable to grouse 
as a variety. But the practice of burning great 
stretches of heather, instead of firing the ling in care- 
fully selected strips, is much to be regretted. Of 
course accidents will occur from time to time. No 
amount of care will prevent a few sparks from a passing 
locomotive firing a dry moss in a rainless season, any 
more than it would prevent our grouse being felled 
by a wire fence or by the telegraph wires newly erected 
upon some spot where grouse often cross the hill. 
But pains can be taken to see that heather is burnt 
by the shepherds in such a way as to meet the require- 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 43 

ments of each hursel of sheep, while respecting the 
rights and interests of the prince of game birds. 
Shepherds, however good and reasonable they may 
be in other respects, like to delay the burning of 
heather until the latest legal date. They have their 
reasons for their choice. They do not care to fire the 
heather until it is very dry, for this reason, that if the 
stems of the heather are green they will not burn well, 
but will become hard and sharp, and the sheep will 
not willingly feed among it. The drawback to post- 
poning the burning of the heather is the fact that the 
grouse is an early breeder, and that late fires are likely 
to disturb breeding birds, and to drive them away 
from their nests. So the first point in keeping up 
a good supply of grouse is to secure a clever and 
thoughtful management of the heather. 

The next point is to supplement a good supply of 
food for the grouse by waging war against its four- 
footed and winged persecutors. The modern game 
preserver has often a genuine sympathy for the wild 
creatures that are roughly classed together as 'vermin.' 
It would be a grievous sin, undoubtedly, to extirpate 
even ' vermin ' altogether. People who have no game 
of their own to preserve are sometimes tempted to say 
hard things of those who have, because they kill out 
hawks and other high-spirited creatures. Neverthe- 



44 NATURAL HISTORY 'OF THE GROUSE 

less, there is a mean to be attained in game preserving 
as in all other things. Landowners exercise good 
sense and decency if they tolerate a little ' vermin,' 
both to gratify their own taste and to satisfy the 
requirements of an interested public. But if they 
allow their lands to swarm with ' vermin ' entirely un- 
checked, they injure their neighbours and show a 
want of propriety. 

' Vermin ' should not be extirpated root and 
branch, but common sense requires that they should 
be kept within reasonable numerical limits. In the 
British Islands the birds of prey have become sadly 
reduced in numbers of late years. Collectors of 
blown egg shells a very undesirable class of men 
offer fancy prices for the eggs of the honey buzzard 
and hobby ; so that, if these species try to nest in 
their old haunts, say in the New Forest, they are 
ruthlessly pillaged and plundered without mercy. A 
love of daring induces a good many young fellows to 
storm the nests of the peregrines that nestle on the 
most precipitous portions of our coasts. The eggs 
are so handsome that they really constitute a pleasant 
memento of a hazardous venture, while the young are 
charming pets, and can be trained for the noble sport 
of falconry. 

In many parts of Scotland, and, alas ! everywhere 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 45 

in England, the man who manages to slay an un- 
fortunate eagle of either species is sure to find his 
doughty deed duly advertised by the production of a 
spicy article which goes the round of the papers, 
usually converting a sea eagle from Northern Europe 
into a magnificent golden eagle from the wilds of 
Sutherland. The most amusing instance of the kind 
that has come directly under my notice related to the 
supposed capture of a great eagle-owl in Cumberland. 
A local newspaper gave a high-flown account of how 
the huge bird was winged by a keeper on a moor near 
Cockermouth, and was brought to bay by the intrepid 
exertions of a large retriever dog. I journeyed some 
sixty odd miles to pay my respects to the bird of wis- 
dom, and was not a little entertained to find Bubo 
maximus resolve itself into a forlorn and miserable 
specimen of the short-eared owl. In this case there 
was no doubt as to where the blame of floating a 
canard lay. The editor of a local paper, Mr. Blank 
of Blankington, had seen the bird himself at the 
keeper's house, and the identification of the specimen 
as an eagle-owl was a flight of his own unassisted 
genius. Of course this brilliant hit was copied by 
many of his brethren all over England, and occupied 
a prominent position in some of the more foolish 
journals. 



46 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

In point of fact, the golden eagle does prey to some 
extent on grouse. It likes blue hares better than 
any other diet. Rabbits are acceptable ; so also is 
venison, or hill mutton for the matter of that. But it 
kills a few grouse occasionally. Golden eagles have 
always been respected on our own ground. I am too 
pleased to see them about to grudge them a few 
grouse ; but they prefer the blue hare, which can be 
spared more conveniently. 

A former tenant of Rum assured me that a pair of 
eagles which nested on a certain precipice in that 
island killed a good many grouse, in the absence 
of the blue hares and rabbits which they would have 
chosen. Happening to be a gentleman, he respected 
the safety of the birds, which belonged to the golden 
species. An outsider might have proved less magnani- 
mous. The sea eagle has become so rare in Britain 
that it would be little less than a crime for anyone to 
raid its eyry or to slay a member of its race. Alas ! 
that the hand of the destroyer was stayed so late. I 
could say a good deal about the way in which the 
sea eagles of Skye were exterminated, on a proper 
opportunity. 

The sea eagle has no objection to grouse, and is 
sure to pick off a winged bird. A neighbour of ours 
at one time kept a pair of sea eagles. They enjoyed 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 47 



their liberty, and used to love to accompany their 
master when he went to the hill, swooping down upon 
the birds he shot with great rapidity and unerring 
accuracy of aim. The kite, like the sea eagle, has 
almost been ' improved away ' from our midst. I for 
one am heartily sorry that it has become rare. Those 
that I studied in Spain appeared to live chiefly on 
offal and small reptiles. But I do not believe the 
kite is constant to any one diet. In this district the 
common buzzard feeds upon field voles, because they 
abound and other prey is scarce. In another district, 
not twenty miles away from the first, the buzzards 
live chiefly upon wall lizards. If you open them, you 
find their stomachs crammed with these reptiles, 
which you would have fancied were too swift and 
agile to be captured by so clumsy a round -winged 
hawk as the common buzzard. It is the same with 
the kite. In Germany I have seen it trying to annex 
tiny partridges. In some parts of Scotland, grouse 
found an inveterate foe in the beautiful, high-circling 
glede or red kite. The term ' glede,' by the way, is 
often applied to the buzzard and hen-harrier. But 
let that pass. The late Mr. E. T. Booth was a 
singularly impartial and truth-loving investigator. 
He studied the habits of the kite to good purpose 
in a remote part of Perthshire. The result of 



48 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

his researches proved that the kites under observa- 
tion fed upon squirrels and rabbits, as well as upon 
peewits, and the young of curlew, wild duck, and 
pigeons ; but he decided that grouse ' seemed to 
be their favourite food.' One kite's nest, in parti- 
cular, was visited on several occasions, and each 
time 'the young bird had a fresh-killed grouse on 
the nest.' Further, he goes on to state that he 
counted the remains of over thirty grouse under the 
branches of a large fir. ' Some were only bleached 
and weather-beaten skeletons, and probably had lain 
for many months.' He considered that all the birds 
in question had been destroyed by a single pair of 
kites at the beginning of the season. I fancy that the 
offenders would have preferred more ignoble prey if 
it had been forthcoming. Sorry should I be to do 
any injury to a British kite. But our personal 
feelings must not be allowed to overpower our better 
judgment, and the preservation of rapacious birds, 
however desirable from a scientific or philosophical 
standpoint, possesses some distinct drawbacks for 
game-preservers. The male hen-harrier is a lovely 
bird in his delicate blue garb, and I know no more 
beautiful sight in nature than a hen-harrier quartering 
a moor, as I have seen it do in North Uist and other 
places. But there cannot be any doubt that both 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 49 

male and female harriers are both extremely destruc- 
tive to grouse, and relentless in their pursuit. I do 
not justify the extermination which is so rapidly over- 
taking this bird, in consequence of its nesting on the 
ground, and being easily trapped beside its young, for 
it is a devoted parent. I do not go so far as to say 
that it feeds principally on grouse ; but I have no 
doubt that the presence of this charming harrier is 
highly inimical to the interests of both grouse and 
partridges. The peregrine falcon kills a good many 
grouse on some inland moors, but a long study of its 
habits has convinced me that it feeds on many other 
birds in a larger degree. I believe it prefers puffins 
and other sea fowl to grouse. Of course I admit also 
that this falcon kills grouse at every period of the 
year. Every sportsman knows the truth of this 
remark. It is not as well known that the peregrine 
feeds also on small birds. Young ' red ' falcons are 
very destructive to young grouse, but they are not very 
discriminating, and live largely on thrushes and other 
small birds. I once crept within a yard or two of a 
beautiful peregrine, as he was perching on a crag of 
rock a thousand feet above the boiling waters of the 
Minch. He was so busily engaged in dissecting a 
fresh-killed skylark that he never observed my stealthy 
approach to his stronghold. It has often been said 



50 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

that the peregrine picks off the weakliest bird of a 
covey. The statement is not, however, supported by 
my experience, neither is it in keeping with what we 
know of the peregrine's character. The fact is, that a 
high-couraged bird like the falcon disdains to strike 
an unworthy quarry. She prefers a good chase. A 
Highland deer-stalker expressed the true view of the 
case with the naive remark, that ' the falcon is a real 
sportsman ! ' So she certainly is, and as such she 
has no stomach for flying sickly grouse. It is my 
belief that the peregrine, if she selects at all, selects 
the gamest bird in a covey, and the better the flight 
afforded by her victim, the keener is the falcon's 
enjoyment of the sport. 

I am no advocate for exterminating peregrines. 
On the contrary, I have taken some trouble to afford 
them protection in the breeding season ; but we can- 
not expect everybody to see the falcon in a favourable 
light. One of my friends dissected six peregrines in 
a spring, all old birds. Five of them had been feed- 
ing on grouse, the sixth had eaten a wild duck. Of 
course this did not prove much. The birds were 
quite as likely to have contained rock doves or puffins. 
But the grouse has a strong and vigilant enemy in the 
falcon, and all that can reasonably be expected of the 
owners of grouse moors is that they will tolerate the 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 51 

peregrine without allowing it to increase locally. The 
trapping of peregrines is easily accomplished when 
the falcons nest in the face of the sea cliff. Such 
birds as breed in high rocks in the interior of the 
country have a better chance of defying the exertions 
of keepers. Whether the buzzard ever kills grouse, I 
cannot say. I incline to think that it would readily 
kill a weakly or ' pricked ' bird ; but I do not think a 
buzzard cares much about grouse if field mice and 
carrion are plentiful. The rough-legged buzzard is a 
finer bird, and more likely to kill grouse. I have 
known of two gerfalcons that were in pursuit of grouse 
when killed. They share the fancy of the peregrine 
for the flesh of that persecuted bird the Cornish 
chough. 

The sparrow hawk is common in many of the 
wooded parts of Scotland adjacent to grouse moors, 
and does some mischief in spite of its small size. A 
female sparrow hawk occasionally cuts down a full- 
grown grouse ; while the male, light as he is, has suffi- 
cient audacity to seize a winged grouse. Neither 
the kestrel nor the bonnie little merlin causes the 
grouse much sorrow. They may carry off the chicks 
when a day or two old, but only, I fancy, in very rare 
instances. I have preserved our breeding merlins 
for a dozen years, finding that they rear their brood 

E 2 



52 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

almost exclusively upon wheatears, meadow pipits, 
and other unimportant little birds. Once only in all 
my experience did I find the foot of a grouse chick 
in the nest of a merlin. I wish that the poor hen- 
harrier could be held equally blameless. 

To summarise my own experience of birds of 
prey, I venture to say that, so far as they act merely 
as ' nature's police,' their presence on the grouse moor 
has at least its redeeming features. Our grouse are 
all the stronger and hardier for having to struggle 
hard to maintain their existence. The thoughtless 
persecution of birds of prey, or of any other feathered 
fowl, is culpable in the extreme. But the interests of 
the sportsman and of the naturalist are closely allied, 
and the one ought to help the other in the wise 
management of the grouse moor. 

Proceeding now to speak of the less noble enemies 
which thin the ranks of our coveys directly or indirectly, 
I own to a considerable distrust of the raven. Cer- 
tainly he feeds chiefly on carrion, but I am afraid he 
is fond of grouse eggs, and sucks their contents when- 
ever a chance presents itself. So my endeavour is to 
keep the numbers of the raven down, without, how- 
ever, threatening their local extinction. The worst, 
because most cunning, foes of the grouse are the 
carrion and hooded crows. They are the worst of 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 53 



' vermin ; ' there can be no two opinions about that. 
In Norway, I know, the hooded crow is pretty omni- 
vorous. So he is in Scotland, out of the breeding 
time. In winter he will eat corn, or kill field voles, 
or gorge himself on stinking fish on the seashores 
But the black and hooded crows are dire enemies of 
sitting grouse. They carry the eggs away to the rock, 
near their nest, and the amount of mischief they do is 
incalculable. An acquaintance of mine saw three 
' hoodies ' attack a young grouse. He was a fine 
bird, and could fly a little, but he could not withstand 
the attack of three of the black rascals. A few sharp 
blows upon the back of the head soon disabled him, 
and placed him at the disposal of his cowardly assail- 
ants. There is no worse pest in Scotland than the 
hooded crow. The carrion crow is as mischievous, 
but its visits to the grouse's home are more irregular. 
Much as I dislike the use of poison, I think it should 
be employed in the extermination of hooded crows, 
provided only that the eggs which have been 
' doctored ' with strychnine be placed in a forked 
branch, or in a crag of the rocks to which no four- 
footed animal is likely to penetrate. The careless use 
of poison almost amounts to criminality. Only a few 
years ago, a fine golden eagle was killed by poison in 
a curious way. A neighbouring keeper had prepared 



54 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

some rats with strychnine and put them out on the 
hill as a bait for hooded crows. Unhappily, the male 
of a pair of golden eagles, then breeding in the locality, 
chanced to swallow one of the defunct rats, and 
perished miserably, to our eternal regret. 

Some individual rooks are most persistent in 
harrying grouse nests, and owners of rookeries ought 
in my opinion to be held legally bound to shoot their 
rookeries every season ; for these voracious birds are 
long-lived, and if too numerous in a district, they do 
harm in a variety of ways that the general public never 
dream of. 

Whether jackdaws are generally mischievous on 
a moor I cannot say, but I know that in a dry 
season they rob many grouse nests, and I think they 
should be treated as vermin, and shot if possible at 
sight whenever they appear on the hill. Richardson's 
skuas are sometimes shot as destructive to grouse. 
They would no doubt bolt a tiny grouse if they felt 
hungry, and a chance offered itself ; but that is not a 
contingency which happens frequently. The black- 
backed gulls are very destructive to young birds of 
every kind, especially the lesser variety. I do not 
think the great black-backed gull troubles much 
about grouse. He cares more for fish and for car- 
rion. But the lesser black-backed gull is a shame- 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 55 



less gourmand, and does a great amount of mischief. 
He likes the young wild ducks better than the tiny 
grouse, but nothing seems to come amiss to his 
hungry maw. It occasionally happens that an old 
herring gull takes to felonious practices. They suck 
poisoned eggs eagerly, and I have seen individual 
birds beating the hill day after day searching for 
grouse nests. I have also known the herring gull to 
carry off young chickens from a cottage door. But 
the grouse suffers more from hooded crows than from 
gulls or any other of its natural enemies. Cats that 
have run wild, collies that are badly fed, these, with 
foxes and stoats, are the worst furred foes that the 
grouse has to dread. In the Highlands we kill out 
the foxes, at least so far as is possible. It is very 
necessary to keep them down, for they would com- 
mit sad havoc among the lambs if allowed to become 
numerous. 

It may be said in conclusion that the grouse has 
fewer enemies to fear than formerly. The marten 
cat and wild cat anciently took their toll of moor- 
fowl, but their presence has been banished from most 
of the haunts of the red grouse. 



56 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER IV 

THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 

CONSIDERABLE interest attaches to the plumage of the 
grouse, and most sportsmen have had occasion to 
remark upon the great variability of both sexes. This 
would not apply to the chicks, which are at first 
clothed in fine down, greyish yellow in ground colour, 
prettily variegated with chestnut and dark-brown 
markings. Nor does it apply eitherto the birds in first 
feather. ' At first the upper parts are brownish black, 
each feather edged and barred with yellow,' says Mac- 
gillivray, and a young bird in my hand agrees with 
this description, though some of the edgings to the 
feathers are pale chestnut rather than yellow, and the 
extremities of the feathers of the interscapular region 
are spotted with buffy white ; the lower parts are 
yellowish grey barred with pale reddish yellow. From 
this condition the birds pass gradually into the chief 
stages of adult plumage, which have been very cleverly 
worked out by Mr. J. G. Millais, who possesses a 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 57 

large number of skins of the Scotch grouse. Both 
male and female grouse are liable to leucotism, or, in 
other words, to exhibit a tendency to assume white or 
light-coloured plumage. The male grouse have two 
dominant types of plumage, the red and the black. 
The females have three principal plumages : the black, 
the spotted and the yellow. The red is found, ac- 
cording to Mr. Millais, principally in Ireland and the 
Outer Hebrides. He finds little difference in Irish 
birds whether they be killed on the swampy ground 
of the north and south or upon the high mountains 
of Mayo, Connemara and Donegal. 

The black form ' is the most unusual of the three 
types, and one which is very rarely developed to any 
degree of purity. It is more often to be found mixed 
with the red or the white type, but most commonly 
with both. When combined with these two forms, it 
is the one most commonly met with by the sportsman 
during winter, and five old cocks out of six, shot 
at that season, will be found to be of this type.' 

As for the females, Mr. Millais decides that the 
red type is the rarest, and the spotted and breeding 
dress birds are the most beautiful. 'The females of 
the red Irish bird are yellow, and not red, as would 
be supposed ; they are, however, quite different from 
what are generally known among Yorkshiremen as 



58 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

" yellow hens," which latter are finer in the markings 
of the feathers, and lack the boldness of the lines 
found in the Irish bird.' Mr. Millais points out that 
grouse will be found in full moult in April, August 
and October, but they change plumage gradually 
all through the year. From the month of May 
the plumage of both sexes passes through all the 
changes mentioned in the case of the ptarmigan, 
and every fresh month brings its alteration of 
feathers, either by moulting, discoloration, or both, 
till by November the bird stands clothed in its winter 
dress, that shows the type completed in one form or 
another. Young birds of the year are easily distin- 
guished till the month of September, but by Novem- 
ber it is impossible to see any difference between 
them and the old birds. Many men who have spent 
the best part of their lives on the moors will assure 
you that grouse vary in colour according to the ground 
they frequent, just as others feel convinced that they 
find certain types of colour in certain counties. Thus 
they hold that what they call ' stone-bred grouse ' are 
reared in rocky places, and that their plumage is 
barred rather than spotted, and of a generally greyer 
tone of colour than is elsewhere met with. I cannot 
say that I personally place much faith in such asser- 
tions, believing that birds vary almost indefinitely even 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 59 

on moors in a single county. As regards the white 
type, though Mr. Millais distinguishes it as a separate 
phase, I do not see how it is to be separated from 
leucotism. Albinism i.e. the correlation of white 
plumage and pink irides is another question altogether. 
Albino birds have often been obtained, but I have 
never yet come across an albino grouse, though I have 
heard of several white ones. But the white type of 
plumage seems to be akin to leucotism, and I hardly 
see how we can separate the two things. Many 
grouse have the lower parts beautifully frosted with 
white in winter. Sometimes white feathers appear 
among those of the back. Not rarely do white 
feathers crop out on the throat and breast. Birds 
which have the flight feathers of the wings partially 
or entirely white are obtained both in England and 
Scotland from time to time. 1 More decided varieties 
occur in which the ground colour of the plumage is 
buffish or greyish-white or pale silvery, varied with 
the usual characteristic markings in a subdued form. 
Such birds have been obtained in Ireland, England 
and Scotland. Mr. Millais considers that they are 

' I should feel very grateful to any reader who would send 
us a white variety of the grouse for the Carlisle Museum at any 
future time. Such a gift would, of course, be cased with the 
donor's name attached to it, and should be addressed to myself, 
or to The Curator, The Museum, Carlisle. 



60 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

most liable to occur at a high altitude in the north of 
Scotland. It may very well be so. Most of those 
that I have heard of myself were killed in the north 
of England at a very moderate elevation above sea- 
level. That such varieties are rare there can be no 
doubt, but they are not always preserved, even when 
procured. These pied and so-called white grouse are 
often bred from ordinary parents. On the other hand, 
when the sport has once cropped up, it is liable to be 
perpetuated, if the first pied or light-coloured birds 
are spared. Last season (1893) a hen grouse was 
shot near Alston in curious plumage. The wings were 
cream-coloured, and the body feathers were of a dirty 
white. Three of her young birds were pied with 
white ; the other four birds of the covey were ordinary 
grouse. A few springs ago a Skiddaw shepherd sent 
me word that a white grouse was sitting on eggs upon 
the farm at which he worked. Unfortunately I was 
not able to go and see the bird. I have often thought 
of introducing the willow grouse to my own moor, in 
the hope that it might interbreed with the red grouse. 
These two species appear to be descended from one 
common ancestor. The young of the willow grouse 
bears a close resemblance to the young red grouse in 
first feather. The willow grouse has an enormously 
wide range ; it is, in fact, almost circumpolar, being 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 61 

found in the northern parts of both the old and the 
new worlds. Its flight and note are those of the red 
grouse ; but, in addition to having acquired a permanent 
plumage of the white type, it has learnt also to perch 
in trees, an accomplishment to which the red grouse 
has not yet taken kindly. Possibly the red grouse is 
an insular form of the willow grouse, which still puts 
on many white feathers in some parts of its Western 
home. This knotty point, unfortunately, we cannot 
decide satisfactorily. The red grouse is monogamous 
and consorts only with its own kind. There are 
nevertheless a few well-authenticated specimens of the 
wild cross between the red grouse and black-game, 
as there are also perfectly black examples of the red 
grouse. As long ago as 1836, Mr. Macgillivray 
examined and dissected a hybrid of this cross. 
Altogether he examined three specimens which showed 
the characters of both the species from which they 
were derived, and furnished the following description 
of a male specimen : ' In form and proportion it is 
similar to a female black grouse. The bill is of the 
same form as in that bird. The supraocular mem- 
brane resembles that of the red grouse, having a thin 
free fringed margin, which is not the case with that of 
the blackcock. The feathers are generally oblong, 
broadly rounded, and have a large tufty tumule. The 



62 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

tail is complete, slightly forked as in the female black 
grouse, but of only sixteen feathers, as in the red 
grouse. The quills are twenty-six. The tarsi are 
feathered all round, without a bare space behind. 
The toes are also feathered a third down, as are the 
interdigital membranes, and the plumage of these 
parts is as bushy as in the red grouse. They are 
margined with pectiniform scales, as in the black 
grouse. The claws are very long, arched, with thin 
parallel edges, like those of the red grouse and grey 
ptarmigan.' l 

The bird just described, which we may con- 
sider the type of this variety of hybrid, had the upper 
parts generally minutely undulated with brownish 
black and brownish red, with very narrow terminal 
bands of white. The upper part of the head was 
minutely mottled with brownish red, brownish black, 
and grey, but the rest of the neck was black, with a 
tinge of reddish purple. The primaries were greyish 
brown. The tail was black, the eight middle feathers 
narrowly tipped with white. On the lower parts the 
feathers were black, tipped with white, those of the 
sides being banded with red; The only hybrid be- 
tween the red grouse and black-game that has hitherto 
been obtained in England is a fine male preserved 
1 British Birds, i. 162. 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 63 

in the collection of T. H. Horrocks, Esq., of Eden 
Brows, Carlisle. Several specimens have been met 
with in Scotland, and a single hybrid of this kind has 
lately been obtained in Wales. I have heard of two 
other birds referred to this species, but in neither in- 
stance was the bird preserved, the reason being that 
they were hard shot. This is a misfortune, for the two 
species interbreed so very rarely that all specimens of 
their hybrid offspring possess great interest for natu- 
ralists. There is reason to think that a more extra- 
ordinary hybrid than that just named occasionally 
occurs, viz. the offspring of the red grouse and partridge 
Mr. Howard Saunders has devoted the following re- 
marks to an accredited hybrid : ' Hybrids between 
the partridge and any other species are uncommon, 
but Mr. F. Bond has a bird shot on Blubber-house 
Moor, near Harrogate, in August 1866, by the present 
Lord Walsingham, which appears to be the result of 
a cross with the red grouse, the bill being strong and 
grouse-like, the tarsi and feet partially feathered, the 
breast and body mottled with pale reddish-brown with 
a sprinkling of grey, the quill feathers dirty white, with 
lavender-grey outer webs. The brown colour of the 
upper parts is not very significant, but the feathering 
of the tarsi and feet seems tolerably conclusive.' ' 

1 Yarrell, British Birds, iii. 1 14. 



64 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

The feathering of the tarsi does not satisfy my 
mind about the bird ; for this reason, that I have 
grounds for believing that common partridges are liable 
to be ' feather-legged.' A Crossfell keeper assured me 
that he had shot partridges with feathered legs, and 
referred me to a shepherd whom we met on Crossfell. 
When I asked that worthy whether he had seen any 
' fell partridges,' he asked at once, ' Do you mean 
the rough-legged ones ? ' adding that he knew them 
well. Mr. J. G. Millais states that two hybrids between 
the red grouse and partridge have been obtained in 
Scotland, but he has not been able to describe these 
interesting specimens. It seems perfectly possible 
that the red grouse may interbreed with its ally the 
ptarmigan, but upon this point no conclusive evidence 
is at present available. One other point at least re- 
mains to be noticed, and that is the weight of grouse. 
The cock birds not infrequently weigh 28 or 28^ 
ounces in the North of England, when in first-rate 
condition in every respect. Anything over 30 ounces 
is noteworthy, but a weight of 32 ounces is not unpre- 
cedented. 



CHAPTER V 

GROUSE-BECKING 

THE capture of wild birds has always exercised the 
resources of human ingenuity from time immemorial. 
The ancient Egyptians were masters of the art of fowl- 
ing, and some of their methods still survive. I shall 
presently speak of certain methods of poaching red 
grouse ; but I propose to treat first of the dubious but 
not necessarily illegal pastime known throughout the 
breadth of the North of England as grouse-becking, 
or becking for grouse. Those writers who have 
hitherto essayed to write about the natural history 
of grouse seem to ignore one important feature in 
their habits. Exception must be made of Mr. 
H. E. Dresser, who published the following note by 
Mr. Alston in the ' Birds of Europe ' : ' Early on 
frosty mornings, the cocks are fond of perching on a 
"know" or hillock, and uttering their clear-ringing 
" Er eck kek'-kek! wuk, wuk wuk" At such 
times they may often be seen to rise perpendicularly 

F 



66 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

. in the air to a height of several feet, and then drop 
again on the same spot.' This brief remark supplies 
the key to the sport of 'becking.' When grouse go 
to roost late on in the afternoon, they do not huddle 
together like partridges, but scatter over the ground 
on which they intend to sleep, at the same time taking 
care to keep but a little distance apart. When the 
old male wakes in the morning, his first thought is to 
find his mate and sport with her during the early 
hours that precede the rising of the sun. Accordingly, 
rising on the wing, the male grouse begins to in- 
dulge in short, playful flights towards the object of 
his attentions. Rising quietly off the ground, the bird 
flies up to a height of fifteen or twenty feet above the 
ground. He then commences to drop again, and 
simultaneously utters his cry, l err beck, beck, beck, 
beck, goback, goback, goback] the latter portion of his 
cry being concluded as he alights upon a tussock of 
heather or some other natural prominence. The 
female responds to the overtures of her mate, and he 
continues to repeat his amorous performance until the 
arrival of daylight suspends his erotic demonstrations. 
The North-countryman who desires to go ' becking ' 
takes the trouble to ascertain in advance where the 
birds are most likely to be met with in his neighbour- 
hood. He rises from his bed in the dead of the 



GROUSE-BECKING 67 



night, fills his pockets or belt with cartridges, and 
sallies forth through the darkness to the spot in which 
he intends to obtain sport. Arrived at the right place, 
which is generally quite in the centre of the bleak 
moorlands, and often miles from any human habita- 
tion, the fowler takes up his position behind the best 
screen that offers itself. The angle of two stone walls 
often serves as a temporary shelter, or he may hide 
himself beside a pile of peats that are drying in the 
wind. He has to remain perfectly still and silent, no 
matter how cold the job may be, for any demonstra- 
tion of impatience would surely spoil his chances of 
success. As soon as ever he hears a cock grouse start 
to call, his own business begins. His task in the first 
instance is simply to reproduce as nearly as he can 
the call of the hen grouse, which is not easy to in- 
scribe upon paper, but may perhaps be rendered l yap, 
yap, yap, yap,' or 'youe, youe, youe? 

The cry of the hen is reproduced in several ways. I 
know a Cumbrian peasant who despises the assistance of 
any instrument in ' becking.' He contrives to imitate 
the cry of the female grouse by compressing the 
nostrils with one hand and drawing in his breath, which 
is then emitted in deep gasps. This he has practised 
for years, and he can call male grouse up to his cottage 
door most successfully. Some men use a metal bird- 

F 2 



68 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



call, others a bramble stem which has been hollowed 
out with a red-hot wire. The majority of those who 
go out ' becking ' carry with them the stem of a clay 
pipe, and use this as their call. It does not matter, 
in fact, how the sound is reproduced, provided it be 
communicated in a soft key and bear a close resem- 
blance to the cry of the bird. Long and unwearied 
practice in calling is the chief requisite for successful 
grouse-becking, coupled with a quick and accurate ear 
for sound. I have met with one or two men who can call 
hen grouse almost as easily as cocks, but no one cares 
to shoot the female birds. The strategy of the fowler, 
then, is very simple. He has to call the cock grouse 
up to him as to a supposed female. The bird that has 
begun to answer him flies up and alights upon a tussock 
of moss or other prominence in order to take his 
bearings of the female companion which he wishes to 
join-; the fowler calls the grouse at short intervals until 
the bird arrives within shot. He then shoots him, if 
he can, in the dim uncertain light which precedes the 
arrival of the dawn. When the day breaks the grouse 
cease to ' beck ' and begin to look for an early break- 
fast. It is not a sport for a neophyte, but an old hand 
often manages to bag several grouse in the course of 
an outing. It must not oe supposed that this is 
necessarily regarded as poaching. In Yorkshire, in 



GROUSE-BECKING 69 



Cumberland, and Westmoreland, if not in other 
counties, ' becking ' for grouse is or was recognised as 
a highly entertaining sport, and frequently put into 
exercise, though it has latterly fallen into disuse. 
Still no old-fashioned keeper in Lakeland or on the 
Border thinks anything of getting a brace or two of 
grouse for his master's larder by ' becking.' Lots of 
stirring stories about this sport are told by the reserved 
dalesmen ; but they are shy of favouring strangers 
with their confidences, and any irregularities that they 
happen to allude to, are sure to have happened to some 
acquaintance, for they are too sharp to willingly com- 
promise themselves. 

One of the most successful of latter-day fowlers 
was a ' proper poacher,' who chiefly resided in Durham 
and Northumberland, working at his trade as a miner. 
Cumberland was his native county, and he came home 
occasionally in order to indulge in a spell of poaching 
on his favourite preserves, the keeper in charge being 
his particular enemy. One fine morning late in autumn, 
when a sharp frost had just set in, the ' proper poacher ' 
rose betimes and shook himself, after which he strolled 
off to the hill, a moor near Crossfell, to call grouse. 
The weather was so specially propitious that he felt 
certain of some exciting sport, nor was he disappointed. 
He had no sooner arrived at his hiding place, and ' got 



70 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

set,' than he began to call. To his satisfaction he 
was very soon answered by a grouse, which alighted 
on a knoll within shot of his position. He took a 
very careful aim with his old muzzle-loader, and his 
finger was already touching the trigger, when, to his 
astonishment, another gun 'went off and shot t' bird.' 
Recognising the sportsman who had spoilt his shot, 
he deemed it prudent to slip home unnoticed and 
return to bed. A few hours later the keeper, who had 
evidently expected to meet him on the moor, called 
at his lodgings and proceeded to chaff the poacher 
whose practices troubled him, with the homely inquiry, 
' What's matter thou isn't out this morning ? ' The 
old hand could not conceal his annoyance any longer, 
and he blurted out the fact which he had tried to 
conceal : ' If thou'd been half a minute langer, lad, 
thou'd havft seen whether I was out or not ! ' 

Frosty weather suits the pastime of ' becking ' best 
dry frost, that is to say, unaccompanied by any 
serious fall of the temperature. It must be under- 
stood that ' becking ' is not always successful even on 
days that appear highly favourable. There are days 
when the birds ' beck ' freely and others when they 
will hardly ' beck ' at all, though no reason for their 
acting differently on these occasions can be fairly 
assigned. The champion ' becker ' of a certain fell- 



GROUSE-BECKING 7 i 

side village is the local shoemaker, who loves to 
narrate his experiences. It so fell out, he says, that 
upon a certain day he started soon after midnight for 
a favourite spot, distant about six miles from his 
cottage, and situated in the very heart of a ' smittle ' 
place for grouse. The track was ill defined, and he 
seemed to be a long time in arriving at his destination. 
When at length he reached the scene of his intended 
operations, he sat down in the moss and waited for 
the approach of the grey twilight. After long suspense 
at last his ears were gladdened with the much-desired 
challenge of an old cock grouse. He called in answer, 
and the bird responded and flew nearer and nearer, 
until the exciting moment arrived when he saw the 
moorfowl ' sit up ' upon a prominent tuft of heather. 
Taking a careful aim, as he thought, with his heavy 
fowling-piece, he pulled the trigger, and, as he thought, 
killed his bird. However, he was too old a hand to 
show himself prematurely, and as his gun was only a 
single muzzle-loader, he thought it best to reload before 
he jumped up. But no sooner had he rammed a 
fresh charge home than he looked up and spied the 
bird sitting on the tuft of heather as before. He 
concluded that he must have missed it after all, and 
he took a second shot at it with a similar result. To 
cut the story short, our hero fired nine successive 



72 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

shots, as he declares, without ever leaving his hiding 
place, at a grouse which seemed to lead a charmed life, 
as it always reappeared. He fired a tenth shot ; no 
bird could be then seen. He therefore jumped up, 
and ran to the knoll of heather, where he found no 
fewer than ten dead grouse disposed around the spot 
that had proved so fatal. His explanation was this : 
that he had fallen in with a company of birds which 
were running close together, and that each time that 
he fired and knocked over a bird, another bird in the 
company ascended the point of danger to make a fresh 
reconnaissance. It is not at all unusual for an old hand 
to get a brace of birds at one spot in the half light of 
approaching day. If a bird offers a chance to the 
gunner, but is missed and flies away, its companion is 
pretty certain to follow it. On the other hand, if one 
bird is shot dead, and drops still upon the heather, 
its companion will probably remain waiting for it to 
rise, and perhaps afford a second shot. Grouse can 
be shot in this way at any time between August and 
March, but the last months of the year are held in 
most esteem. 

In March the male grouse are very restless, and 
fly from one knoll to another, frequently alighting. 
They still ' beck,' but their cry has become slightly 
altered since the autumn ; they now seem to say 



GROUSE-BECKING 73 



' churrr goback, goback? It would be interesting to 
know whether the custom of ' becking ' was practised 
by our forefathers when they shot with crossbows. 
I am inclined to fancy that in those days their larders 
were often supplied with snared grouse, which had 
been captured upon the ' stocks ' of corn. Probably 
the methods of setting snares for grouse are various, 
as indeed I know they are. That which appears to 
be most extensively practised, at any rate in the north 
of Scotland, is to prepare a number of snares of fine 
wire and attach them to a stout cord, which is then 
stretched across a ' stook ' of oats, the ends of the 
string being securely attached to two stakes which 
have been driven into the ground on either side of 
the ' stook.' Another plan is to set a great number 
of snares in the runs which the grouse make through 
the heather when feeding. These snares are generally 
made of fine copper wire, bent in the form of a loop 
of from five to six inches in diameter. The free end 
of the wire is doubled, and attached to a tuft of ling 
by a piece of string. The loop of wire is often held 
in the proper position by a small cleft piece of wood. 
Some men take grouse in drag-nets, when the birds 
are roosting in rough grass and young heather ; but I 
fancy that this method of poaching grouse is less 
practised than formerly. Sportsmen cannot be too 



74 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

careful to enlist the interest of herds and shepherds in 
the preservation of grouse. The goodwill of the small 
farmers and tenants of allotments abutting on the 
moors should be courted sedulously, and their for- 
bearance rewarded. I say so, as indicating a practical 
policy, for these men have many temptations to acquire 
birds dishonestly, or, as a working man expressed it, 
' There can be no bigger poachers if they take it that 
way.' Some individuals allow their dogs to snap sit- 
ting grouse. Colley bitches are often apt pupils in 
such nefarious practices. The story goes that a coun- 
tryman was known on a certain occasion to have 
prematurely exhausted his credit at the bar of the 
' pub ' he patronised, for he was thirsty still. He 
then inquired of a friend if the 'laal bitch' was at 
home. Being answered in the affirmative, he called 
for the sheepdog, and having taken her to the hill, he 
soon returned with a brace of ' snapped ' grouse, which 
renewed his credit. On another occasion the sheep 
were being gathered a small farmer who had volun- 
teered to assist the shepherds was observed to be 
carrying his short coat over his arm with more than 
usual carefulness. On inquiry being made, it turned 
out that this rascal had allowed his cur-dog to snap 
a whole covey of little grouse. The dog's master 
willingly joined in the illegality ; to quote his own 



GROUSE-BECKING 75 

words, ' He thought he would have a pie when he got 
home.' But how was the game to be stowed away ? 
He had tied the sleeves of his jacket, so that they 
were converted into bags, in which the birds were 
nicely concealed. He then turned the coat inside 
out, in order that the sleeves might not be seen, and 
congratulated himself upon his cleverness in smuggling 
stolen grouse. Mr. J. G. Millais unearthed an old 
Highland poacher, who explained an ingenious method 
of capturing both grouse and ptarmigan which is often 
adopted in Ross-shire and Sutherland when the snow 
is deep. ' The poacher discovers a place on the hill 
where the birds are in the habit of sitting when snow 
has fallen. To this spot he repairs when the down- 
fall has ceased, and before night if possible, so that 
the snow may be still soft and not frozen. He is 
armed with nothing but a bag of oats or corn, and a 
beer or, still better, champagne bottle. Thus, having 
nothing of a suspicious nature in his possession, he 
would be allowed to pass, even though searched. 
Arrived on his ground, he proceeds to make a number 
of indentations in the snow with his bottle, and the 
bottom of the cavity, just within reach of the birds, 
he fills up with grain, and, scattering the rest of the 
contents of the bag near the holes on the surface, 
he departs, to return next morning and collect his 



76 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



plunder. Unless a frost occurs the trick must neces- 
sarily be a failure, but if the cavity becomes properly 
hardened, and the birds find the food, success is 
almost a certainty. A grouse or ptarmigan finding 
what to them is a great delicacy, immediately imparts 
the knowledge of its presence to others in the neigh- 
bourhood. They at once greedily devour all the 
grain that is lying around, and then turn their atten- 
tion to obtaining the stores lying in the holes. Pro- 
bably by straining their necks to the uttermost they 
may be able to reach a few grains, but this only serves 
to whet their appetites, and they must have more. 
Consequently they go on reaching till they eventually 
topple over into the hole, which just comfortably cor- 
responds to their own size, and in which the more 
they struggle to extricate themselves the more firmly 
do they become wedged. When a bird is forced into 
a hole, even should the sides be smooth, it is not 
easily withdrawn, as the feathers resist being pulled 
backwards ; but when the sides are rough the reten- 
tion is doubly great, and the feeble strugglings of the 
unfortunate bird in its cramped position are not suffi- 
cient to enable it to escape.' 

Of late years much vexation has been occasioned 
to sportsmen in the north of England by the deadly 
practice of netting grouse with fixed engines. These 



GROUSE-BECKING 77 



consist of nets made of very fine twine, netted to a 
three-inch mesh, which are suspended from poles 
placed ten yards apart, at such a height as permits 
the fellside sheep to pass under them. Each net in 
a series is independently suspended on a cord stretched 
across the poles, and can be hung tight or loose, as 
desired. They are easily put up at least, I am 
assured that two men can fix up a thousand yards of 
nets in an hour. The nets are shifted according to 
the direction of the wind. Grouse have generally a 
favourite line of flight, but they do not always adhere 
to the same course. When the birds are flying, there 
is sure to be a leader in the company. This one strikes 
the net almost to a certainty, and down it instantly 
falls. The way in which these nets are worked is 
very simple. Of course they could not be tolerated 
on any gentleman's moor, but certain outsiders hire 
small farms and allotments on the edge of grouse 
moors, with a view to annexing their neighbours' 
grouse. The birds themselves assist inadvertently 
in their own capture. Their principal time for shift- 
ing about is in the evening, after feeding, and again 
after ' becking ' in the morning. But they are par- 
ticularly restless on many moors about the end of 
September and in October, especially the female 
birds, and the first strong gale brings many of them 



78 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

off the hill-tops, looking for more sheltered and genial 
situations. Naturally, many of them seek the edges 
of the moors, and are caught in the nets set upon 
such allotments as abut upon them. This method of 
netting grouse is very disastrous. The mischief of 
capturing the birds is only part of the evil. The 
worst feature about it is that the hens are caught in 
such numbers as seriously to interfere with the breed- 
ing stock. It is true that birds of both sexes will fly 
a long distance to a patch of black heather during a 
prevalence of severe frost and heavy snow, but earlier 
in the season the number of hens caught generally 
outnumbers the cocks very seriously. The reason 
for this seems to be twofold. The hens shift about 
in packs more irregularly than their male companions, 
and they are less partial to the high grounds, but seek 
the lower portions of the moor, and such as are most 
screened from the east winds. Fine open weather, 
however, suits the grouse- netters best, and they say 
that the birds fly very long distances when shifting 
about the hills. The old cocks keep their own 'heaf,' 
or station, on the hill with more constancy than their 
female companions. In the morning the birds ' start 
to feed ' soon after they cease ' becking,' but they do 
not feed so heavily in the forenoon as later in the 
day, an hour or two before dusk especially, when 



GROUSE-BECKING 79 

their crops become distended with food. In the 
morning hours they like to sun themselves in dry 
moss or on an open slab of rock, each bird resting 
with one wing expanded like a fowl. As for the ways 
of disposing of poached grouse, they are manifold. 
Sometimes they are hawked about the country by 
persons selling peat. Often they are taken to market 
with other produce. The railways and parcel post 
both offer excellent facilities for furthering the distri- 
bution of the birds. Personally, I was once favoured 
with a fine red grouse in rather an unexpected fashion. 
Our keeper happened to shoot an Iceland gull, and 
wrote to inform me that he despatched the bird to 
me by that day's parcel post. His letter came, but 
no gull appeared, and I therefore begged the Post 
Office authorities to make a search for the lost bird. 
The gull arrived eventually by rail. Meantime the 
postal authorities had taken counsel, and finding that 
a grouse without a label had come into their posses- 
sion, they forwarded to me the moor-fowl, plucked 
and roasted as it was, with a polite intimation that 
they conjectured that this, being evidently a bird of 
some description, might probably prove to be the 
Iceland gull that had gone astray.

CHAPTER I 

' THE SCOTCH MAIL ' 

THE lamps are being lit in Bloomsbury. Long ago 
they have begun to twinkle in the small bird shops of 
the ' Dials,' and to flare in the gin palaces of the 
avenues. As the dull brown haze of a London 
August evening settles down the streets become 
thicker with people, and every tenement in this part 
of the town pours forth its quota to the stream upon 
the pavement, there to strut or loaf, or drink away 
its short hour of ease, until bed, straw, and plank 
receive once more the weary bones of the toilers of 
the city. 

As your cab rattles along towards Euston or 
King's Cross the wheels spatter black mud legacy 
of the leaden drizzle of the afternoon upon the pale 
faces and ragged clothing of the denizens of the 
cellar and the garret : men, women, and children in 
crowds, to whom gas serves for air, garbage for food, 
and vitriol for drink ; who have never trod a hillside

or leapt a stream, and to whom heather and rock, 
bracken and pine are as unknown as the Ovis Poll 
to an Islington butcher. 

Bound as you are for the land where these gifts 
of Nature, added to the charms of stag, salmon, and 
grouse, await you in plenty, the contrast between your 
happy state of mind and the cheerless, airless lives of 
these people is brought vividly before you, and you 
must give a glance of sincere pity to the groups of pallid 
faces whiter and thinner, it seems to you, than usual 
huddled together in dark doorways, or peering 
hungrily from cellar gratings. 

But you and I were not ' born to set it right '- 
here is the great railway station looming dark but 
welcome through the fog, the narrow shave of an 
upset as you drive in at the tall narrow gates, the line 
of flashing lamps and eager porters, and as you leap 
*o the ground and hand your minor baggage to the 
old man with a face like a winter apple, and well- 
worn patches of grey on the familiar green corduroy, 
the squalor of the Dials passes from your mind, and 
cheerfully you set your face towards the North. 

Tickets are taken, luggage stowed, dogs bundled 
in, rod, gun, rifle, and cartridge cases carefully seen 
to, book selected, sleeping berth inspected, and ere 
you have quite finished the final instructions to 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL' 85 

the trusty servant who remains in town, suddenly, 
with no more warning than a short blast from the 
pea-whistle of the smart guard, the great train begins 
to glide slowly and smoothly away. As you pull up 
the window, a shout of ' Good-bye ! ' from some less 
fortunate person, seeing off a dear friend, rings along 
the platform, and turning back into the well-lit 
carriage you realise, as the train plunges into the 
dark tunnel under Hampstead with a quickening 
pace and an increasing rattle, that you are fairly 
off. 

But you are very tired ; the last day's business 
has been heavy and anxious, and you haven't yet 
shaken off the clinging meshes of your work-a-day life. 
Wearily you lean back in your seat, and as the 
hoarse roar of the tunnels and the flying flashes of 
the station lamps tell of the terrific pace at which 
the train is now travelling, you sink, the end of your 
cigar glowing fiercer in the dim light, into a lethargy 
variously tinged with care and hope. Presently you 
rouse yourself to make arrangements for the night, 
hand your tickets to the civil 'conductor,' with in- 
structions to wake you half an hour before Perth, 
dispose your bed and wraps, and before darkening 
the light pull down the window for a moment to sniff 
an air that blows fresher and sweeter than St. Stephen's,

Capel Court, Lincoln's Inn, or Pall Mall, and to be- 
come aware that you are tearing over the borders of 
Hertfordshire at fifty-five miles an hour, on a magnifi- 
cent starlight night. The great oaks and elms of old 
England fleet by you like streams of cardboard trees, 
the long, low landscape fades into the blue-black of 
the sky, and so steady is the going that the distance 
seems like a slow dioramic procession of woods and 
hills, while you alone are motionless, and the nearer 
objects houses, fences, telegraph poles, parapets, or 
platforms but so many formless phantoms, rushing 
with roar, scream, and rattle back to the South. 

Then comes sleep, in which the monotonous vibra- 
tion of the train reiterates itself persistently, and intrudes 
upon your dreams ; your clients, patients, colleagues, 
or opponents whispering vague things to you to the 
eternal accompaniment of the noise of the wheels, 
their words and your replies always twisted to fit in 
with the exact beats of the pulse of the engine or the 
clicking of the coupling irons. A slackening, a hissing, 
and a cessation of the throbs give you a moment of 
conscious sanity at Rugby. This has no concern for 
you: you gather your rugs, always slipping off on to 
the floor, more tightly round, and as the porters, like 
far-off ghosts shouting to each other in a huge cavern, 
repeat the well-known name, all you can think of is 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL* 87 

that Dickens wrote something wonderful about Rugby 
Junction, and that you once knew a man who kept 
horses there and hunted from London very incon- 
venient, but you are asleep again. 

This time fairly and placidly, with hardly a pause 
in a vivid but pleasantly long dream, while you are 
whirled unconscious past the flaming cities and lurid 
wastes of the Black Country, to the open pure 
country, and suddenly, for no reason, you are broad 
awake ; a cold grey daylight is slanting through the 
cracks of the blinds, and the sight of your bundle of 
fishing rods in the corner reminds you that you have 
left London and business, and are going to the moors. 

Ah, but it was the cold that woke you, for you are 
chilly, and drag down your cape the old cape that has 
sheltered you from so many driving showers and cut- 
ting winds, that has been so often stained with blood 
and peat, oil and sea water, tea and travel fold your- 
self in it up to your chin, and lie there in the grey 
dawn, thinking, listening to the occasional whistle of 
the engine, wondering whereabouts you are and what 
time it is, but supremely happy. 

Your whole nature seems to have undergone some 
change. A purer air is filling your lungs, and though 
you have a very slight sore throat, and are, generally 
speaking, dirty, unkempt, and chippy, a wondrous calm 






88 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

has come over your whole being. No longer do the 
cares or dilemmas of yesterday assail your peace ; 
the House of Commons- and the City how small 
and far off they appear, as a little gleam of pale 
sunlight illumines the details around you, and a 
smothered rumbling tells that you are crossing a 
bridge over a river. You must look out ; up goes 
the blind ; and there, there are the everlasting hills. 
Great grey -green slopes of Cumberland fells, patched 
and scored with heaps and rifts of slaty stone, black 
in the shadow and white and wet in the light ; veils 
and wreaths of misty shower, like puffs from a colossal 
steam-engine, travelling across the face of rock or 
grass ; far up, a little slender white thread of a water- 
fall you can almost hear the trickle and splash of 
the water on the stones, or trace the sound of its 
gurgling rush down through the beds of granite, 
fringed with greener bracken, to the valley. 

Black cattle grazing unconcerned along the lower, 
white sheep on the higher slopes ; straggling stone walls 
of any age dividing the huge pastures ; deep dens 
down which the foaming becks are pouring, where the 
mist clings longer and blacker until the early flight of 
chattering rooks and jackdaws crossing to their feed 
is relieved in deeper notes of black against it. 

Now comes the sun, slanting along the hill, gilding 



SCOTCH MAIL' 89 



the knolls and silvering the wet stones ; the puffs of 
curling mist seem to draw themselves higher up, grow 
whiter and more palpable in his rays, and become 
absorbed in the solid gold-white mass of cumulus 
cloud floating against the blue of this glorious summer 
morning. 

The hills, too, seem to have grown farther off, the 
landscape is lower, rich crops and waving corn appear, 
the silver stream of Eden reflects red bridges and black- 
green woods, and in a few more minutes a vision of 
red stone and brick, of old grey wall and clustering 
chimney, of filmy smoke against the luminous air, 
and ' Carr-lisle ' rings in a clear northern voice 
along the platform ; the train is still once more. 

It is yet very early, and feeling warmer and more 
restful, though you peep out to look along the train 
(why ?), you do not care to rise. The northern dialect of 
the porters, contrasted with the accent of your London 
guard, arrests your ear for a moment ; you have time 
to note a few types, shepherds and nondescripts, loaf- 
ing into the station as the light brightens, to catch 
some local train or receive some unsavoury package, 
and you are away again. 

Soon appear the flat marshes that fringe the 
Solway Firth, the broad stretch of still water outside 
the reeds reflecting the white wings of the gulls or 



90 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the strings of fowl rising seaward, the fainter, longer 
lines of the estuary, and far off, flecked with little 
diamond flashes of white in the sun, the great grey 
sea itself. Lines of black posts, of which you wonder 
the use and meaning, stretch through the reeds from 
the shore, as though seedlings from the black timbers 
of the long low bridge that carries you across the 
marsh. Little cottages nestling under sycamore and 
birch come in sight ; the great wreaths of steam from 
the engine float and fade away over the landscape, and 
as they whisk across a little village of white houses, 
brush over the slate roofs, and dance away into the 
fields beyond, a long wooden platform rattles past 
you, and the magic word ' Gretna,' in white letters on 
a blue board, tells that you are fairly over the Border, 
and fills your mind with thoughts of the comedies and 
tragedies which many such a glorious morning has 
witnessed around the blacksmith-parson's cot on the 
historic green. 

What a contrast ! The whizz of your train, ' speed 
forty-five miles an hour,' with its living freight of a 
hundred persons, tearing past the little station, and 
the swaying, rolling post-chaise, with its steaming

shot the leader of the pursuing chaise some ten miles 
back, clattering over the rudely paved main street and 
pulling up at the blacksmith's door ! 

Ah ! times are changed ; now no one stops at 
Gretna except by creeping trains to which in Bradshaw 
the ominous syllable ' Gov.' is tacked, and you yourself, 
sailing along in your sleeping car, to which a king's 
litter of a past age is for cost and cunning workman- 
ship but a cheap and tawdry conveyance, are already 
among the rolling moors of Dumfries, and were you 
not so sleepy would be craning your neck at the window 
to catch sight of a brood of grouse rising lazily off the- 
stone wall by the railway, and settling down again 
upon the nearest heathery knoll, crowing to the sun. 

A second sleep comes over you, veiling your 
thoughts with delicious visions. Little you reck of 
the sweating toilers pausing by the great furnaces and 
glowing cinder heaps of Motherwell to stare as you 
roll by ; little of the clankings and shoutings, the 
shuntings and bumpings of inevitable Larbert ; little 
of the rush through station and town, past castle and 
cottage, manse and moor ; the rattle of wheels, the 
clanking of the iron, and the regular pant of the 
piston-rod have become your lullaby ; and you are 
enjoying a foretaste of the rest that we are promised 
in heaven. 



92 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

The Dials wake to their dirt, Bloomsbury to its 
business, and the slums to their squalor ; the lamps 
are out again now, and the sickly rays of morning 
rouses the pallid city folk to another day of struggling 
toil. The shiverings and fevers, vices and terrors, 
miseries or murders of the London night are even 
now being turned out naked to its bitter glare ; the 
thundering din of traffic, the bawling of commerce, 
and the shrieking of machinery drown in their deafen- 
ing chorus the weeping of the weak, the moans of 
the sick and dying, the cries of all their victims. 
Only the strong, the clever, and the hopeful awake to 
live in the stream that can no more be stemmed than 
the tide of the ocean the overwhelming civilisation of 
a great city. 

But you speed on in peaceful oblivion of all this, 
in which at other times you bear your part, while you 
are carried over hills and valleys clad with purple 
heather, under a sky of boundless blue flecked with 
shining white clouds, swaying gently round the 
shoulders of great hills, gliding across deep ravines 
and in and out of peaceful glens, threading through 
thriving towns or lazy villages. But now some 
curious change in the music of the train noises 
first puzzles, then half rouses you, and then, two 
feet from your ear, one piercing cry of ' Scotsman,' 






THE SCOTCH MAIL* 93 



uttered in the shrill nasal twang of a Lowland newsboy, 
brings you straight up on your seat, and you are 
broad awake to find yourself at Perth. Hastily you 
get over a doubtful toilet, and feeling now as fresh as 
a lark, embark upon the sea of confusion which the 
great platform presents. Breakfast, rapid and hearty, 
refreshes you, and as you superintend the change of 
your baggage into another train for you are bound 
still farther north you have time to cast greetings to 
many an old friend, a bow or a smile to some fair 
ladies, and an oath or a caress to a brace of handsome 
setters who, coupled together and panting with excite- 
ment, have run between your legs and nearly upset 
you. 

This is a shorter though slower run, and you feel 
yourself growing nearer and nearer to the magnet that 
is drawing you northward. Leisurely you mark the 
bloom on the heather, the emerald of the moss on 
the walls, the bright brown colour of the river, and the 
rings of the trout where he rises in the still, deep pool ; 
and as a greyhen sails out of the scrub and into a 
pine wood, you reflect with satisfaction on your 
new Purdeys, with the ejectors, and on the ' first-rate 
consignment' of Schultze powder with which your 
cartridges are loaded. 

But here you are arrived ! The sun shines brightly, 



94 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



the breeze blows freshly, and there is no emperor or 
sultan that may not envy your feelings as you cover 
the short mile from the little station to the lodge in a 
useful brown dog-cart with a fast-trotting pony in the 
shafts. 

A warm welcome from your host, and you are not 
long in slipping into your shooting things, and ere the 
clock has struck eleven are bowling along with a cheery 
party to the moor. As you step on to the heather, 
and feel the true moorland breeze in your face, your eye 
is as keen and clear as the lens of a microscope, and 
crossing the plank bridge over the river you pause to 
mark in the brown waters flecked with snowy foam the 
swirl where the big fish rose only yesterday, after the 
great spate, which has left streamers of sodden hay, 
dead logs, and leafy twigs clinging to the timbers of 
the bridge and the overhanging birches at the side, 
twelve feet above the present placid level of the 
stream. 

Can there be such a thing as toil or business, as 
the turmoil of party strife or the grasping greed of 
gain, in musty chambers, foetid alleys, and paved courts ? 
It would be difficult to believe in their existence as 
you survey the heavenly prospect before you after 
climbing somewhat laboriously, it must be confessed 
the first rounded knoll above the river, and paus-

ing to watch the dogs uncoupled and to give a first 
eager and searching glance over your ground. 

In the foreground the trim figures in grey home- 
spun of your companions and the keepers, their keen 
and healthy faces relieved against the peat or heather, 
the polished gun-barrels glistening in the sun, the 
liver and the white dog taking their first scamper, the 
sturdy custodian of the ponies and the lunch, the 
kilted boy with the other couple of dogs, the seedling 
birches and feathery young larches of the moor edge 
flickering in the golden light of the August noon, to 
the sound of the steady roar of the great fall of waters 
at the tail of the pool behind you. 

Beyond, the colouring is gorgeous away for 
miles the slopes and shoulders, the knowes and 
hollows of purple and pink heather stretch to where 
the glassy loch lies shimmering under the solemn 
precipices of a mighty peak with an historic name. 
Supporting him on either side are ranged the rugged 
forms of his giant brethren a study in faint grey and 
blue, with here and there a patch of dwindling snow 
to tell of the bitterness of the recent storm. In this 
glorious amphitheatre you attack your sport. The 
white dog comes to a dead point on your side of a 
knoll, and is beautifully backed by the liver-coloured 
bitch, who halts on a great piece of flat rock some

seventy yards away, a motionless and perfect picture. 
Three grouse rise, you kill with your first, and, your 
host courteously waiting to let you deal with your first 
right and left alone, strike the second hard but under- 
neath, while he neatly drops the third bird a beautiful 
long cross shot. 

Exactly sixteen hours from the time you were 
driving through Bloomsbury you have killed a right 
and left of Perthshire grouse, on a spot which fifty 
years ago would have taken eight days to reach, if 
even in those days there had been anyone to try it. 

The details of your day's sport, so well known in 
their incidents, we will not follow. After a glorious 
day, very weary, but, having acquitted yourself well, 
supremely contented, what more delicious than the 
long drive home down the glen, the moor darkling 
on either side, the shadow deepening to blackness 
as you wind through the big pine wood and are 
shown against the western sky the capercailzie in 
their accustomed place on the giant larch that over- 
hangs the road, or the spot where the greyhen killed 
herself against the carriage? Turning out of the 
wood you come upon all the glory of the yellow 
moon, just rising over the eastern hill, and glittering in 
the waters of the loch ; the horses quicken their pace, 
lights twinkle in the distance, and now as you swing

in at the gate of the lodge grounds a savoury whiff 
courts your nostrils from the shining kitchen window, 
while as you turn the corner to the door the first 
skirl of the pipes warns you that it is already half- 
past eight, the ladies are waiting, and you must be 
quick down to dinner. 

A journey such as I have tried to describe is only 
one of the many combinations which English brains 
and love of sport have rendered not only possible but 
usual. Truly the red grouse is responsible for many 
things in these days, and, let envious or ignorant 
persons sneer as they may, will continue to be so for 
many years to come until, in short, some one cleverer 
than the rest of the world invents a means of driving 
a plough through a peat bog, or dragging a harrow 
across the rocky glens of Scotland and the north of 
England. 

The grouse has his influence over politics, as 
we are constantly reminded ; over trade and railway 
enterprise ; and last, but not least, over the well-being 
and prosperity of a large proportion of our population. 
The moors are to an Englishman what ' les eaux ' are 
to the Frenchman, or the Alps to an Italian. Even 
the wealthy Frenchman and the Italian are, with the 
millionaire American or Austrian prince, to be found 
pouring their gold into the pockets of the Highlander, 



98 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



in pursuit of the hardy and succulent race of birds 
which will soon represent the only British monopoly 
in the world, and which are known as grouse. 

Observe the scientific knowledge, the inventive 
power, the practical resource, and the financial enter- 
prise which go to make up every detail of the 
marvellous journey from the south to the north of 
Great Britain. Short as it may seem to the man from 
New York or Chicago, it is still in moral and material 
detail the most remarkable piece of travelling in the 
world. And what has produced this? Not all the 
beauties of Edinburgh nor all the factories and 
furnaces of Glasgow; not the enterprise of Dundee 
nor the fisheries of Aberdeen ; nay, neither the 
Trossachs nor the Pass of Killiecrankie, the snows of 
Ben Nevis nor the depths of Loch Lomond, but 
grouse, grouse and nothing else ! 

It would be idle to attempt to forecast the political 
condition of these crowded islands in the next century, 
but of this I think we may be tolerably certain that 
so long as the everlasting hills remain as they are, 
until, in short, some unthought-of metal, some un- 
expected industry arises to people their glens, tunnel 
their heights, and crush their rocks, so long will 
grouse remain a potent factor in the internal economy 
of the northern portion of our race. 



' THE SCOTCH MAIL ' 99 

It is notoriously difficult to get a straight answer 
from a Scotchman, but this year, in conversation with 
a very intelligent specimen of the Highlander, who 
was, by the way, an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. 
Gladstone, the replies that I elicited to my very direct 
questions were so emphatic in favour of the existing 
state of things, founded on his own intimate know- 
ledge, that I wished some of those narrow city dwellers, 
feeble in body and spiteful and envious in mind, who 
so far as they dare attack everything in the nature of 
sport and amusement, could have heard him on this 
well-worn subject. 

He would have none of the small crofter, who 
starves himself and his family for a false sentiment 
which ties him to the barren rock or spongy morass 
which never can support them ; he was all in favour 
of the large grazing farm of many thousand acres, and 
of the wealthy sporting tenant from the South, who 
comes to distribute his guineas and to repeople the 
once famine-stricken glen. The men, he urged with 
vehement sincerity and actual knowledge, who clamour 
for the small holdings, have not the means to stock 
them, nor those who encourage them the knowledge 
to show them how to do it. How could these people 
divide and pasture a hill, command a market for their 
stock, or live in any fashion upon their allotted piece 

H 2 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



of ground ? Pointing eloquently to the ruins of 
many cottages of a bygone age, high up the glen near 
the burn-side, he discoursed of the evils of the starv- 
ing, hopeless life these little squatters led, and truly 
observed that no men of to-day with any self-respect 
would live huddled together in the filth and smoke, 
and half-nourished on the snatches of meagre food 
which were their normal conditions. 

Fewer people, he said, there might be in the glen, 
but there would after the first abortive trial be fewer 
still were the rich graziers and the sporting tenants, 
who between them employ so many hands and feed 
so many mouths, to be chased away, and their places 
taken by a lot of tag-rag and bob-tail with whom 
discontent passes for independence, and insolvency 
for liberty. ' Long live the grouse ! ' he cried ; ' they 
,do not interfere with sheep, and nothing else, save 
eagles and foxes, hawks and stoats, could live up here.' 

I have dwelt at some length in another volume of 
this series ' on the important question of the relations 
between the owner or sporting tenant with the humbler 
folk who become his neighbours or dependants ; on 
the supreme importance, both to his sport and to the 
well-being of the district, of goodwill and liberality on 
his part and co-operation on theirs ; and I was rash 
1 Partridge, p. 239. 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL' 101 

enough to appear as an optimist on the Game-law 
question. What I said of English, I might repeat 
more securely of Scotch sport. The value of game 
to the country in general materially, from a com- 
mercial point of view ; morally, from the interests and 
sympathies it tends to create or maintain between 
members of different classes is enormous, and since 
it introduces civilisation and material prosperity to 
the most remote districts, it is especially so in the 
case of grouse. 

The Scotch mail, running at lightning speed along 
its well-laid track, with all its luxuries and scientific 
appliances, its sleeping or dining cars, its heating 
apparatus and lavatories, its air-brakes and electric 
bells, its magnificent locomotives and trusty servants, 
its priceless freights and distinguished occupants, is 
the most intrinsically valuable expression of this state 
of things. 

Long may it continue to run ; long may the healthy 
attractions of the most picturesque and beautiful of 
British sports continue to fill its compartments, and 
help the dwellers of the far North to share the hard- 
earned gold of England's wealthier citizens ! 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER II 

' OVER DOGS ' 

To the average owner or tenant of a Scotch moor, 
grouse shooting means ' over dogs ' and nothing else. 
A few years ago such was the onslaught made upon 
driving and its partisans, that it became necessary to 
take up the cudgels in its defence. But now that all 
Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Durham have adopted it 
exclusively, and that many persons in Scotland have 
followed the example of these counties, the press and 
the public recognise that it is useless to abuse a system 
which those interested almost universally employ. 

In treating this subject I have been obliged to re- 
cord my honest conviction of the superiority of driving 
as an art, as well as of its advantages to the general 
stock of birds. But in a work of this kind one must 
endeavour to be just all round, and recognise the fact 
that there are many persons, some of them excellent 
shots and sportsmen, who would not on any account 
abandon the ancient and beautiful sport of shooting 



OVER DOGS' 103 



grouse over dogs, or to whom the organisation of 
drives would be neither convenient nor practicable. 

As a youth I duly graduated with Don and Ponto, 
' Wallass ' and Lady on the higher moors of Forfar, 
Perth, and Aberdeen, and approached a point with 
as much keenness as ever Colonel Hawker felt when 
sculling to a bunch of fowl on the ooze of Key- 
haven, or advancing on a covey in the sheltering 
stubbles of Longparish. Yet when I had been intro- 
duced to the increased excitement, the superior marks- 
manship, the ampler results, and the more picturesque 
aspect of the birds in Yorkshire driving, I became 
contemptuous of those who were content to plod day 
by day after their dogs for a much smaller number 
of comparatively easy shots. But one grows more 
catholic with age. I have had many pleasant days 
since then with other Dons and Pontos, and should 
regret as much as anyone to see the extinction of so 
valuable a race of dogs, or the complete abandonment 
of so picturesque a science. 

I recall few days' shooting with greater pleasure 
than a bag of fifty-three brace to my own gun, which 
I made on September 23, 1872, on the late Sir Charles 
Forbes's moor in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, after many 
hundreds of brace had been taken off the ground by 
both driving and walking ; and that, considering the 



104 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

date, was a satisfactory performance. There is nothing 
in it, perhaps, even worth recording ; yet the fact re- 
mains that it is graven on my memory as a red-letter 
day, and ranks in my reminiscences of varieties of 
shooting with some of the best days of driving in 
which I have ever taken part. 

Shooting as practised in England is, on the whole, 
less selfish than most other forms of sport, yet it is 
also tinged with a proportion of the vice. I may, there- 
fore, be forgiven for saying that I think grouse shoot 
ing over dogs is eminently a sport which is best 
enjoyed alone that is, by one gun only. It is true 
that the party of two is the more correct form, granted 
that the pair work together absolutely without jealousy, 
and with exact knowledge of one another's powers. 
But these conditions are rare, and it is not too much 
to say that in no branch of shooting are greater 
sacrifices of result made to the essential qualities of 
courtesy and consideration for the capacity of your 
companion. If two guns can kill forty brace over 
dogs, you may be quite certain that the better of the 
two could have killed thirty brace, if not more, over 
the same ground on the same day. A good hand at 
the work can, if he chooses to set aside the unwritten 
laws of politeness and fair play, take so much advan- 
tage of an inferior hand as to practically absorb all 



'OVER DOGS' 105 

the chances, and obtain what satisfaction he may 
from achieving much the larger share of the bag. But 
a few hints may help a man who is not an adept to 
avoid finding himself always in the position of second 
best, or trying too severely the temper or good manners 
of his more accomplished companion. 

We will suppose that your dogs are well handled and 
steady, and that there is a fairly good scent, a breezy, 
pleasant day, and enough birds on the ground to 
reward you for hard work and good shooting, while 
for it is the object of this work to assist, if pos- 
sible, those who have something to learn you are 
alongside a man who is much your superior, possibly 
a past master of the art. The first thing to note care- 
fully and incessantly is the wind. This you must 
bear in mind all the time ; otherwise, when you see a 
point, you will be quite at sea as to where the birds 
are likely to be lying. There is no doubt that a 
wind blowing across the ground you are beating is 
altogether the best ; and supposing that you have 
as your allotted beat the long 'face' of a hill, with 
cultivated ground or pasture along the lower side, and 
the march on or just over the ridge on the upper, with 
the wind blowing downwards, it will be best to begin 
at the bottom, and work across and across till you 
have beaten the whole face, and pushed all the birds 



106 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

possible forward. You will thus drive them mostly on 
to some stretch of lower ground beyond, which will 
give you probably your best sport towards evening. 
As you work the ground in this way the birds will 
obviously be always lying above, that is, up wind of 
the dog, and the moment you see him point you 
should walk in a slant towards the ground above him, 
rather than straight to him as the novice would. If 
you do the latter, and your friend the professor is on 
your right, he will cross higher up, and probably, 
while appearing to let you go straight for the point 
and the best chance, walk right into the covey and 
get a double shot, while you, though still level with 
him, are yet a long way below the birds. Again, you 
must watch the behaviour of the dog narrowly. Should 
he stop very suddenly in full career, turning his head 
slightly back, then run quickly a few yards, do the 
same thing again, but appear unsteady and inclined 
to hunt further, he is probably up wind of the birds ; 
in which case walk pretty straight to where he first 
pointed. If, again, he simply points very steadily, go 
slowly up to him, a little up wind as before ; if he 
draws rather rapidly and keenly ahead, get after him 
slanting your course up wind of him as quickly as 
you can. These will be wild birds, probably old 
ones, whom it is most desirable to destroy, and they 



'OVER DOGS' 107 



will be running or creeping uneasily before him, most 
likely working up wind also. In this case you may 
get a shot by fast walking or running where you would 
not by going slowly. Come in to the point where you 
can across the wind and above the birds, so as to push 
them forward as you wish. If you get in or past them 
from below, they will be likely to go up to the ridge 
and off your ground, or swing back. 

Remember that a bird must always rise with his 
breast up wind, especially if it is blowing hard, and 
that there is no more killing moment than when he is 
just turning to go down the wind after the first rise. 
To be ready to take him like this, or in fact to kill 
any old or wild bird, you must have your gun ready 
to throw to the shoulder in a second, and must study 
your walking, so as not to be stumbling when he gets 
up. Husband your wind and your strength, especially 
in the early part of the day, as much as you can ; and 
fear not to take a good long rest at luncheon time, for 
the sake of your men, dogs, grouse, and yourself. Birds 
rest in the heat of the day, and the scent is weak ; 
morning and evening, but evening especially, is the 
time to make a bag. 

On the same piece of ground, should the lower 
side be bounded by the burn only, with good lying 
on the other side, it will be better to work the face 



IDS SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



longways, taking a long beat along the lower side first, 
coming back almost on the empty ground and then 
repeating the manoeuvre, just as you would often do 
in a turnip field when you wish to push partridges 
forward. Again, if the wind be blowing exactly the 
reverse way that is, up hill I should advise taking 
the top beat first, or at least working the top side most 
as you cross and wheel, so as to protect the march. 
What I have suggested here applies when you have a 
long hill-face to beat, perhaps the simplest as well as the 
most frequent formation of grouse ground in Scotland. 
But when you have to beat an area of flat or undulating 
moorland above the hill-face, it is better to get straight 
to the higher part of the ground first. Grouse lie 
on higher ground during fine weather, and you must 
break them up on this, so as to deal with them later 
on when scattered on the lower ground. But in what 
I may term ' mixed weather ' they will be more on 
higher ground during the morning and middle-day 
than in the evening. In very wild, stormy, and wet 
weather, you had best, for the sake of your moor, not 
be out at all ; but if you are, it will depend entirely 
upon your observation of how the sheltered spots lie 
whether you get a bag or not. When the wind is very 
strong there is absolutely no chance of your finding 
broods lying on the windy side of a hillock or ridge. 



OVER DOGS' 109 



An odd old cock you will disturb sometimes from 
the most exposed places, and this I have never been 
able to explain, except on the theory that he has heard 
you coming from afar off, and run on to the exposed 
ground to look around for you. But then, again, these 
odd birds in exposed places sometimes lie very close, 
and rise with such a cackle as almost disturbs your 
nerves, so that we must suppose they have been able to 
find some special little bit of warm shelter which suits 
them, although on the windward side. But the bulk 
of the birds, and all the broods, will be found lying 
with some protecting ridge or hillock sheltering them 
from the wind. In perfectly calm, still weather you 
may almost do as you like, beating the ground regu- 
larly and extra closely, and so crossing it as to push 
the grouse on to the part you reserve for the late 
afternoon, with the proviso that you take the higher 
ground first. But whenever there is a breeze, "and 
still more when it is blowing really hard, the science 
of making a good bag of grouse, given that you can 
walk and shoot well, is entirely a question of the con- 
stant study and observation of the wind. Remember 
that your dogs rely on it entirely you must therefore 
bear it in mind, so as to understand their movements ; 
your birds are guided by it in their choice of lying, in 
their method of rising, and in their eventual flight ; 



no SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

while your keeper, especially if Scotch, bases his 
entire scheme and conduct of the day's shooting 
mainly upon the same factor. A Scotchman reckons 
by the compass he never thinks of alluding to the 
right or left of anything, but guides himself, and at- 
tempts to guide you, by North and South, East and 
West. You must be guided by the same instinct to 
this extent that, whether E. or W., N. or S., you must 
bear in mind constantly as you follow your dog the 
direction of the wind, and the effect it is having upon 
the manner of his hunting, as well as upon the move- 
ments of the grouse. 

When you are following your dog directly up wind, 
should the ground rise directly in front of him get past 
him as noiselessly as possible, and as you peep over the 
ridge have your gun absolutely ready, and look out for 
a rise directly you show your nose over it. You will, 
in wild weather at least, get a difficult twisting shot, 
which you will be pleased to kill. If under the same 
circumstances you make any noise, or there is any 
calling or whistling to the dog, you will see nothing 
when you look over, but possibly a distant bird or 
covey, noiselessly skimming out of sight ; or, if you 
are not quite ready and smart, as you look over you 
will be beaten by the unexpected and tortuous flight 
of an old cock as he dashes away from you. 



OVER DOGS' 



The variations of pace or direction in which you 
approach the point must necessarily be founded more 
on experience and the true instinct of the hunter, than 
on anything that can be taught ; but the novice may 
at least be warned that he cannot rely upon the keeper 
and the dog, even when aided by good shooting, ex- 
clusively to make the best bag possible. Rapidity 
and silence in getting to the point are very essential. 
Supposing the dog to be young and not very steady, 
he will draw on the birds, and in a few moments pro- 
bably get too close to them and put them up if they 
are sitting very light. You will say he can be checked 
by whistle or by the familiar ' To-ho ! ' and you can 
get up to them at your leisure. But they will pro- 
bably be flushed by this noise before you get there; 
whereas, if you can get up to the dog very quickly and 
without any noise of any kind, you may get your double 
shot, and the dog, even if he runs in on them at the 
last, can be chastised afterwards. No dog is worth 
anything unless he will stand without even the up- 
lifted hand; and to my thinking many a one is spoilt 
by being so used to this sign and the ejaculation of 
' Ho ! ' that he does not believe in the necessity of 
standing steady unless he hears it. This accounts 
for the loss of a great many chances, and for the too 
frequent cry of ' Hold up ! gone away ! ' which assails 



112 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



your disappointed ears when you come upon a bit of 
sheltered lying where the dog has been ranging for a 
moment or two out of sight. Unless, therefore, your 
dog is absolutely to be relied on to stand steady, you 
must, however much it may try your legs and wind, 
continually keep him in sight. This is frequently left 
to the keeper by the deliberate or indolent shooter. 
The dog disappears over a ridge, the keeper, becom- 
ing uneasy, runs swiftly and looks over, sees the dog 
drawing on birds, and immediately up goes the hand, 
and ' Ho ! ' he shouts. But the movements of the 
dog, the man's appearance on the skyline, and the 
shout are too much, and they are off. If you can 
get to the ridge and be down alongside the dog quickly 
enough the instant you see he has birds, you will very 
likely get your brace, where the slow man would have 
got nothing and never even seen the covey. On the 
other hand, especially in broken ground and deep 
heather, you cannot be too deliberate in quitting the 
ground where you' have found close-sitting birds, or 
you may leave more than one easy certainty at a fine 
young bird from want of hunting carefully enough all 
round. 

Some men seem to have almost as keen an instinct 
as to whether there are birds near them as the dog, 
and this can hardly be acquired, though close watch- 



'OVER DOGS' 113 

ing of the habits of pointers or setters and their 
manner of hunting the ground will teach you much. 
Often when you have found birds up wind of the dog, 
especially if it is blowing pretty hard, it is worth while 
to make a cast back to see whether he has not struck 
the scent between two lots of birds, and whether there 
are not some more of them down wind of him. Espe- 
cially must all these points be attended to when you 
are hunting the ground which you have filled by 
driving broken coveys and scattered birds on to it. 
Towards evening every bit of such ground must be 
carefully searched, and you will soon acquire an eye 
for the likely patches for grouse to lie in. Activity 
and judgment are also much required when, as often 
happens on high ground, you have to work an area 
of deep moss-hags with steep sides of yielding peat, 
and intersected by little ravines, which, powdered with 
stones and, maybe, ancient roots, look like portions 
of the bed of some primaeval flood. Grouse on this 
sort of ground rarely lie well, being mostly old birds, 
or, if not, being on the move themselves from one 
hillock to the other, and here you will do twice as 
much execution if you utilise the ground in your 
pursuit. Keep as much as you can on the tops of 
the hillocks, leaping from one to the other; or, on the 
contrary, if you see a doubtful or uneasy point, and 

i 



II 4 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the ground favours you, running along between the 
hags, keeping carefully off the stones, and so getting 
noiselessly and rapidly up to the dog. 

In all these instances it will be observed how very 
difficult it becomes for two guns to work harmoniously 
together so as to realise the best possible result ; but 
at least it should be agreed between them that, where- 
ever speed is necessary, the man nearest to the point 
should get to it without waiting for the other other- 
wise many chances must be lost. The two shooters 
should, therefore, be as evenly matched as possible. 
I think, where two parties go out on separate 
beats, it is better to send the two better or more 
active and the two slower together; each pair will 
enjoy their day more than on the mistaken principle 
of sending a good gun to ' nurse ' a bad one. This, 
unless they are both angels from heaven, is a trial of 
temper and a mortification to both. 

In very calm warm weather at the beginning of 
the season, where the cover is thick and the birds 
plentiful and tame, any two or even three men can 
take turn and turn about, and manage the amenities 
of the pursuit as easily as if they were beating a 
cabbage garden for very young partridges ; but this, 
though much affected by some gentlemen from town, 
and by dog producers I will not call them breakers 



'OVER DOGS' 115 



who seem to think more of their beasts' coats or 
pedigrees than of their noses, is not the poetry of 
shooting over dogs. It is when the breeze is cool 
and keen, the heather wet from last night's rain, or 
glistening from a slight touch of early frost; when the 
distant range stands like Soracte, toweringly white 
with snow; when the burns run brown and full, the 
oats are ripened, and the hill-face is growing redder 
and more golden; when the river trout are stiff to rise, 
and the blackcock has almost his full tail then is the 
time when to follow a brace of good dogs, both you 
and they in first-rate trim, and to make a bag of 
grouse, is worth the doing. 

For this reason, revolutionary as it may seem, I 
would, supposing that you wish both to drive and 
walk your ground, drive it first and walk it afterwards. 
By so doing you will spare many young birds which 
should be left for breeding, you will get more shoot- 
ing and less waiting and exposure for your drives, and 
sport better worth having and under pleasanter con- 
ditions, granted you pick your days, for your shooting 
over dogs. 

The plugging at very young birds in the early days 
when the weather is hot, and many of them could be 
(or are) taken by the keeper with his hand, when dogs 
and men get knocked up before the day is half over, 

I 2 



n6 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

and hardly any shot you get is any satisfaction to kill, 
while it is a disgrace to miss, is not to my thinking 
worthy of a keen sportsman or accomplished gunner, 
unless he be well past the prime of life and merely 
takes it by short spells as an agreeable pastime. On 
the other hand this is a pleasanter time for your driving 
parties, and the waiting in the butts, always a trying 
operation, is at least not made worse by showers of 
sleet and snow or biting winds. 

After your driving days are over, in bright and 
cooler weather, when it is easier to walk and your con- 
dition is better, you will enjoy your day's point shoot- 
ing more than you have ever done on the Twelfth, for 
every point will test your dogs, every shot will try your 
skill, and every bird will be worth killing. I cannot 
believe, judging from experience, that driving will 
make the birds so wild as to preclude all shooting 
over dogs. I have seen many a good day over dogs 
after the ground had been driven several times, and 
the birds lying as well, on a favourable day, as any 
one need wish; and I am convinced that driving them 
does not make them any wilder, nor so wild, as con- 
stant walking after them with dogs. 

I am against walking the moor in line. This 
seems to be neither one thing nor the other ; it 
disturbs a large extent of ground and terrifies the 



'OVER DOGS' 117 

birds, while the result is usually far from satisfactory 
as to the bag brought home. It is impossible to keep 
a long line of men, extending, say, 500 or 600 yards, in 
proper touch with one another on rough ground. To 
preserve the formation while one man has two or 
three birds to pick up, and the others, far away from 
him, are too anxious to walk on, is usually found to be 
impracticable, and the whole thing ends in a maraud 
more worthy of a gang of poachers than anything else. 

I shall not here attempt to enter into the ques- 
tion of the breeding, selection, or breaking of dogs. 
It is abundantly clear that to go out to make a 
bag of grouse, and to go out to train your dogs, 
are two distinct things, and your dogs should 
not only be well broken, but well exercised and in 
good condition, before you attempt a serious attack 
upon your game. This work is devoted to the grouse 
and not to the dog, and therefore I trust that the 
only apology I need offer is for want of ability to deal 
with the former in the way that so grand a bird 
deserves. 

I confess to a preference for pointers where birds 
are plentiful and lying is good, and for setters under 
the contrary conditions, from their wide-ranging 
powers, and because I am, as remarked before, a 
strong advocate of rapidity of movement. 



Ii8 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

Three guns is an unreasonable number to send 
out in one party, unless you have an abnormal stock 
of grouse, and are anxious to kill all you can. The 
difficulties of dealing properly with the point, of getting 
up at the right moment, of all three shooting at the same 
bird, and other matters of varying skill and courtesy, 
are much increased. And if the grouse are lying well 
it is rather hard on the moor. Yet it is too often 
done. The young men of to-day mostly shoot pretty 
well, some few very well, and at any rate are pretty 
destructive at close-lying young birds ; and three of 
them, with every appliance for quick loading and firing, 
will, as I have already pointed out with regard to 
partridges, kill far too many young birds, while they 
are more than likely to spare most of the old ones. 
These should always be selected where possible as 
your first victims, and I think that when you are 
working a wild beat on high ground, where birds are 
not too plentiful, you should not, when you come 
across a brood, follow it up to the death and massacre 
the whole family, but rather deliberately leave a 
brace of young birds here and there, and turn your 
attention as much as possible to the more difficult and 
fascinating art of circumventing the old inhabitants of 
the ground, my opinion of whom I have recorded in 
the chapter on Scotch Driving. The following extract 



'OVER DOGS' 119 



from Daniell's ' Rural Sports ' reads quaintly in the 
present day : 

'To shew the abundance, rather than the exploit 
itself (which by a Sportsman, must be hoped never 
will be repeated), the Earl of Strathmore's Game- 
keeper was matched for a considerable sum to shoot 
forty brace of moor-game in the course of the i2th of 
August upon his Lordship's moors in Yorkshire ; he 
performed it with great ease, shooting by two o'clock 
forty-three brace ; at eight in the morning, owing to 
a thick fog, he had only killed three birds, however the 
day cleared up by eleven, and the work of slaughter 
went on rapidly.' 

What would the Rev. Mr. Daniell have said could 
he have lived to see the bags more than once of over 
1,000 brace in a day which have since been made on 
this very ground, ' his lordship's moors in Yorkshire,' 
the now famous Wemmergill and its neighbours ? 

We hope forty brace of moor-game in a day may 
often be killed again ; but it is a good bag even now to 
one gun over dogs, and no doubt there will always be a 
sufficiency of men able and willing to do it without 
forfeiting the title of ' sportsman.' 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER III 

SCOTCH DRIVING 

THERE are many things which distinguish grouse 
driving in Scotland from the same sport in England, 
and some difficulties to be overcome in the former 
country which are not ordinarily met with in the 
latter. Nevertheless, it will be my endeavour to show 
that the distinctions inseparable from Scotch driving 
merely add an attractive variety to the sport, and 
that the difficulties are by no means insuperable. 

Ever since the memorable season of 1872, of which 
more hereafter, and which, following as it did upon two 
very good seasons in 1870 and 1871, finally opened the 
eyes of the shooting world to the great possibilities of 
grouse, my opinion has been that on a very consider- 
able number of Scotch moors a scientific and practical 
system of driving, such as has been in force in York- 
shire for years, could and would produce results to 
equal the totals ordinarily achieved in that county, 



and possibly to rival those of the most famous Eng- 
lish moors. 

I have often been opposed in this view, and 
even ridiculed, by men familiar for years with the 
conditions of what I may call an ordinary Scotch 
shooting, and even by some whose experience em- 
braced a large measure of both English and Scotch 
sport. Yet what are the facts? On many Scotch 
moors, notably in Ayrshire, where driving has been 
taken up systematically and scientifically, and where 
shooting over dogs has been abandoned, such respect- 
able bags as 250 and even 300 brace in a day have 
to be recorded ; while even as I write comes the news 
of a bag of over 500 brace in one day, made on the 
moors of the Mackintosh, at Moy, in Inverness-shire. 

There are three principal reasons usually adduced 
to prove that driving in Scotland cannot be carried 
out with ordinary success, still less to the point arrived 
at in England : 

1. The unfavourable nature of the ground. 

2. The opposition or unwillingness of Scotch 
keepers. 

3. The difficulty of obtaining drivers. 

The last of these is in most instances the only one 
that constitutes a serious source of trouble, and this 
only applies to sparsely populated districts, where the 



122 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

few inhabitants are obliged to take advantage of 
every moment of fine weather for their hay or corn 
harvest. 

I propose to consider these objections in detail, 
and try to point out how they may be best overcome. 

There are no doubt localities where the precipitous 
ground, intersected with deep ravines, and powdered 
with great rocks as though cast from a giant's hand, 
precludes any attempt at driving, excepting in a limited 
and desultory fashion, merely to give a day or two of 
variety. It is also superfluous to observe that where 
the grouse moor is merely a slight fringe to the higher 
ground or deer forest, driving need not be considered. 
But putting such districts out of the question, the 
great majority of Scotch moors are what, if I may coin 
a word for the purpose, I should call ' drivable.' 

More than this, there are many which are more 
suitable for driving, and would yield larger bags, than 
a second-rate Yorkshire moor. We are, of course, not 
here considering the comparative attractions or merits 
of driving as compared with shooting over dogs, but 
assuming that the owner or lessee of a moor in Scot- 
land would like to drive his grouse, and thereby 
improve his stock, but considers himself prevented 
by one or more of the difficulties I have named. 

It is a very common error to suppose that all 



SCOTCH DRIVING 123 



Yorkshire, Durham, or Derbyshire moors are quite 
flat, consisting entirely of heather at a certain elevation 
no doubt above the cultivated districts, but which, once 
reached, stretches far and wide in a series of very gentle 
undulations or perfectly flat tableland. A journey 
along the Settle and Carlisle branch of the Midland 
Railway, or a tour over the moors on the borders of 
Yorkshire, Durham, and Westmoreland, will soon 
dispel this. The gills, sikes, and becks of these 
counties are comparable to the glens and burns of 
bonnie Scotland, and the sources of the Ribble and 
the Wharfe, the Swale and the Ure, the Tees or the 
Wear, owe their wildest recesses to volcanic convul- 
sions hardly less violent than those which witnessed 
the birth of the Dee and the Spey, the Tay and the 
Tummel. Yet these southern rivers spring from 
and find their course through the heart of the most 
famous of the English moors, where more grouse 
have been killed in one day than many a Scotch 
keeper looks for in a whole season. 

Again, the low moors of Ayr, Dumfries, or Lanark, 
as well as of parts of Perth, Aberdeen, or Inverness, 
are richer in wide expanse of rolling flat and typical 
driving ground than many of the dales and fells of 
Cumberland, Westmoreland, or the North Riding. 

' Ah, but,' says one, ' my moor isn't like that ; you 



124 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

couldrit drive my ground, it is too steep.' This may 
be so, although he is probably mistaken ; but it is 
impossible to know the particulars and comparative 
conditions of every moor in Scotland and England. 
Nobody's knowledge would be sufficient for this ; one 
can only consider the general characteristics of a 
district. I only know that I have heard this sort of 
speech from men who rent shootings in a district 
where the conformation of the ground is far more 
favourable to driving than many a Yorkshire dale, 
and that merely looking from the train window on 
the Caledonian, the Glasgow and South-Western, 
ay, and on the Highland line, you will see miles 
upon miles of gentle slope and broad hill-face clothed 
in luxuriant heather which to a Yorkshire keeper's 
eye would look ideal ground for driving. 

The very inequalities of the moor, when properly 
turned to account in conjunction with the habitual 
flight of the birds, give opportunities which would not 
be detected by those unaccustomed to study ground 
as well as grouse with this object in view. Where 
the moor is very rocky, and the small ' knowes ' or 
knolls of heather are alternated with miniature preci- 
pices and ravines, furrowed and scored with the rush 
of melting snow, or swept bare by the plenteous 
volume of the summer spate, you will find the grouse 



SCOTCH DRIVING 125 

acquire habits peculiar to the class of ground, habits 
which, if you observe them, you can turn greatly to 
the advantage of your driving. They select rather 
bare and rocky spots for their alighting and surveying 
places, and when disturbed from basking or feeding 
on lower and more sheltered ground they fly to these, 
and almost always by the same route, according to the 
wind. I have had a very fine drive with hardly a bit 
of heather near me, surrounded by frowning precipices 
and huge boulders, and sheltered by a butt formed ot 
the great stones scattered in profusion all over the 
upper slopes of the hill. 

Again, when grouse are pushed, as they often can 
be, across a deep ravine or narrow glen, soaring high 
over the low birch scrub and bracken, haunts of the 
black-game and the roe, you will see if you watch them 
carefully but very carefully that they only alight in 
certain spots on the opposite hill, or that, having a 
rough and rocky ridge to pass over, they invariably 
select certain passes or gullies to rush through to the 
same resting place. 

Here is your chance. Your batteries must be 
carefully placed just behind, not on the ridge, each 
one preferably in a slight hollow or pass rather than 
on a knoll, and you will be surprised at the result. 
Unlike the typical grouse ground as this spot may 



126 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

appear, and though you find no birds sitting on or 
near the butts as you approach them, yet as the far-off 
holloa of the drivers sounds more frequent, round the 
rocks they begin to come, swinging through the passes 
at a terrific pace with the wind, or beating slowly and 
heavily against it, seeming to grow mysteriously out of 
the rock in front, and vanishing like lightning over 
the grey knoll behind, yet always making for the same 
place, until you find by experience that, in proportion 
to the birds upon the moor, your rock or ravine drive 
is always one of the best and most certain. 

The march between two moors is, in Scotland, 
usually on the ridge or watershed, although you will 
often find it defined by a river or a road. Where it is 
on the ridge, the shooting will probably consist of both 
sides of some great glen, with the fiat or rocky ground 
above the ' face,' stretching as far as the highest 
point of the watershed. Now, grouse are very loth to 
fly across a big valley, especially if it is cultivated, and 
should the distance from face to face cost them a 
flight of a mile or more they will hardly ever attempt 
it. I have seen a biggish pack of grouse start across 
a broad valley, where they would have had to go two or 
three miles before they could again alight upon heather, 
fly about half a mile, funk it, and turn back again to 
the hill they were disturbed on. Their inclination is 



SCOTCH DRIVING 127 

always to fly along the hill, and round the bottom or 
side of a knoll, whether great or small, rather than over 
or across it. It is very wonderful to see how they 
save themselves in their flight, especially when they 
are going against a heavy wind. Could you be along- 
side of them, and travelling with them, you would note 
the marvellous way in which they give themselves the 
benefit of the ground to escape rising into the wind, 
passing round all the excrescences and through all 
the depressions in the hillside, clinging close to the 
heather, but always manoeuvring, sidling, or creeping 
to reach the alighting place which they have in view. 

This characteristic will aid you greatly in the choice 
of the place for your line of butts, which, as everybody 
now knows, is the important factor in driving. The 
birds are not likely to leave the hillside on which 
you find them ; consequently you have only to study 
the routes they will take in flying along it. 

If the ground is so intersected by rocks, precipices, 
or deep gorges that your drivers cannot travel it at 
all at least, without consuming the whole day in one 
or two drives you may give it up ; but if your men 
can manage to get about the ground so as to give 
you, say, at least four or five drives in the day, there is 
nothing in the flight of the birds on steep ground 
that you may not turn to your advantage. 



128 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



One often meets with a drive in Scotland where 
the grouse and black-game come over the guns at such 
a height that no shot will reach them ; and you are 
told that this hill is impossible to drive, as the birds 
always do this ; nobody can kill them, and there is no 
result. This is a wrong conclusion. It merely means 
that the guns are not in the right place. These birds 
must touch the ground somewhere, and when you 
have found their point of contact with the earth, or 
alighting place, then you have found the spot where 
you can kill them. 

It is only with the wind or on a perfectly still day 
that they will trust themselves thus in mid-air, and 
then only under compulsion ; they will never attempt 
high flights against the wind. Great as is the power 
of their flight, and strong as their wings and tails are to 
steer by, they have as great a horror of being caught 
high up and rendered helpless by the wind as we 
should have of finding ourselves striking out in the 
rapid stream of a big river. 

Now make an experimental drive and you must 
make many such if you wish for successful permanent 
drives ; place a trustworthy man or two far away down 
wind on the hillside beyond where they come so high 
over you, and you will probably be agreeably surprised 
to find how easy is the solution of the problem. Your 



SCOTCH DRIVING 129 



watchers will tell you that every bird came as though 
out of the sky straight for a particular rock, or peak 
of high ground, and swinging round the point into the 
lee, alighted in the shelter. 

There you have the spot for your butts. Neither 
grouse nor, so far as I have ever seen, any other bird 
can pause and alight in his flight down wind without 
turning round and up into the wind to do it. They 
will seldom attempt this, and almost invariably drop 
into a sheltered spot where they can settle without 
fear of being dashed against the ground by the force 
of the wind. 

So much for your down-wind drives, which are, in 
spite of anything you may be told to the contrary, 
much the most difficult to manage on steep or high 
and precipitous ground. 

You will find it easy enough to push them back 
up wind, provided you attend to one or two essential 
points. The butts in this case must, as I remarked 
above, never be placed along a ridge or sky-line, but 
just behind it, so as to give the guns about fifty to 
eighty yards in front of them to see the birds coming. 
I have never seen a successful drive where it was 
attempted to push birds up wind to butts on a ridge, 
though it can be done with the wind. Again, though 
it is a very pretty sight to observe the birds, at first 

K 



130 SHOOTING THE GKOUSE 

tiny specks afar off, and as they grow bigger to the 
eye to watch every detail of their long flight, speculating 
as to whether they will come to you or your neigh- 
bour, yet this is not the most killing condition. You 
will always observe that more birds are realised when 
everyone remarks that ' I couldn't see them till they 
were right on me,' than when they could watch them 
coming the whole way. Just room enough in front to 
be ready, select your bird, and get the gun up is all 
you want, and for this eighty yards from the butt to 
the ridge is amply sufficient. 

Then each butt must if possible be placed, though 
always adhering to the straight line, so as to command 
what I must describe as a pass that is, a hollow or 
comparatively flat space. I have seen on a sharply 
undulating ridge each one placed on the top of the 
knoll, with the passes or valleys between. The result 
of this is that the birds swerve a great deal, and some- 
times turn back, while the shots at birds below the 
gun as they pass through the hollows are about the 
most difficult you can have. When placed in the 
hollows it will often be impossible to see your next- 
door neighbour, but in this case you have only to be 
careful that when your line of butts is made, a big 
stone, stake, or cairn is put up on the knoll in the 
exact line between the two butts. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 131 

It is absolutely essential that the Scotch keeper 
to whom driving is an unwelcome novelty should be 
made familiar with the aspect of the birds' flight from 
the butts. You must make him delegate the manage- 
ment of the drive to his next in command, and be 
with you in the butts at least once or twice at each 
particular drive, that he may see what happens. He 
will then be able to observe why it is that one or two 
butts have all the shooting, or why birds which come 
apparently well to the guns are at certain drives 
never properly realised ; he will see the difference in 
difficulty between birds creeping through a slack or 
pass straight towards you, and the same birds when 
you only command the slack from above, and have to 
point down at them at a sharp angle as they curve 
round beneath you. Again, he will understand why 
you, after some experience of this drive, possibly con- 
clude that by shifting the whole line of butts only a 
few yards you may convert a difficult killing place 
into an easy one. He will grasp the point, and be 
keen enough unless endowed with too great a share 
of Gaelic obstinacy, to reconstruct the line and watch 
the successful result. You must never be afraid to 
make new lines of butts or to shift old ones, nor 
permit your keeper to make any fuss over the question. 
Scotch keepers are sometimes very troublesome on 

K z 



132 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



this point ; they will not make butts themselves, but 
insist upon extra men being hired to do it. This 
should never be allowed. They have more than 
ample time during the months when there is no shoot- 
ing to do this, and the more they get to know about 
the construction and position of the butts the better, 
while the work involved is nothing but good for 
them. 

Highlanders are, as all the world knows, a very 
fine race of men, courageous and loyal, courteous and 
amiable, they make the best sportsmen and the best 
soldiers in the world ; but they are neither so practi- 
cal nor so energetic under ordinary conditions as the 
northern Englishman, and laziness is their great fail- 
ing. There is a great deal of work involved in erect- 
ing and maintaining several lines of butts, and it is 
necessary that the keepers should be kept up to doing 
this properly. They will soon learn that it is to their 
interest to do so, and that the visitor who is used to 
high-class driving, and possibly knows a great deal 
more of the management of a moor than they do, will 
be more liberally and generously inclined towards 
them if they thoroughly perform their manifest duty 
of keeping everything connected with the shooting in 
first-rate order. 

It is impossible to kill grouse well from a badly 



SCOTCH DRIVING 133 



constructed or ruined butt ; and the man who has to 
wait for three-quarters of an hour in cold and windy 
weather with his feet in three or four inches of sodden 
mud, peat, or water, unprotected from the blast or from 
the keen eyes of the approaching grouse save by dilapi- 
dated walls of sod, sunken to the level of his waist, 
trodden down by sheep or cattle, and never touched 
since they were carelessly erected a year or two before, 
is not likely to feel favourably disposed towards the 
keeper who has charge of these things. His only 
alternative is to scrape out the mud with his feet, 
thereby blocking the entrance to and the drainage 
from the butt, and to build up the front wall by taking 
sods from the back one, the result being to make the 
place still more comfortless and untenantable for the 
next comer on a succeeding day. 

Square butts are always to be recommended, es- 
pecially on high ground, and where sheep or cattle are 
pastured on the moor, as being much more permanent, 
while they afford welcome shelter in bad weather. The 
entrance should be at the side, and as narrow as pos- 
sible, so as to keep out the aforesaid animals. The 
walls should be built high, as remarked on in the fol- 
lowing chapter, and the measurements there given 
adhered to. 

Old birds on the high ground are very wary, as 



134 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

well as very accomplished in their flight, and if they 
catch sight of you will swing away and often turn alto- 
gether from the line. These are exactly those which 
you should be most desirous to kill, and a well-made 
and commodious butt, in which you can keep well 
out of sight, is really most essential in the more remote 
drives, where birds are few and keen, than anywhere. 
Yet you often see in Scotland the error committed of 
taking less trouble over these than over the lines near 
the lodge and on lower ground, where the driving 
is easier. The second difficulty I named above 
viz. the opposition or unwillingness of many Scotch 
keepers has to be reckoned with in this department. 
They must be taught that these things are not fancies, 
nor mere aids to making the sport easy or luxurious, 
but absolute essentials of a successful drive, while the 
proper manner of carrying them out is the result of 
the experience of fifty or sixty years on the English 
moors. 

It is the same with the manner of conducting the 
drive. Many of my readers must have noticed how 
impossible it appears to persuade a line of Scotch 
drivers to preserve the proper horseshoe or half-moon 
shape, or that their flanks are really the most import- 
ant parts of their force. Instead of getting well round 
the ground, and no driver showing himself or beginning 



SCOTCH DRIVING 135 

to move until it is practically inclosed in a great half- 
circle, they drop carelessly, after going just a quarter 
of a mile short of where they should have gone to, 
into some sort of line, and then all come straight on, 
the centre often farther ahead than the flanks (!) and 
the birds, of course, pouring out on each side. It is 
a matter of luck that any birds come to the guns at 
all, a very poor bag is made, and then it is voted that 
driving doesn't really answer, and that you mustn't 
expect what they get in Yorkshire, &c. 

This can only be remedied, to my thinking, by 
the command of the drive being taken by some person 
who understands it, whether the host, or anyone else 
whom he may import to instruct the keepers and 
beaters. His authority must be absolute, and they 
must be brought to understand that successful driving 
is entirely a matter of discipline and organisation. 
The most excellent instruction as to drivers, forma- 
tion, flags, &c., has been set out in the Badminton 
Library, and in Payne-Gallwey's ' Letters to Young 
Shooters ; ' but when do you ever find it acted upon ? 

On the best known Yorkshire moors, where the 
system has been brought to perfection, all this instruc- 
tion is superfluous ; but why is it that in Scotland, 
where it is so much needed, you never find it followed 
out ? The average owner or tenant buys these books, 



136 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

reads them, discusses and criticises them, and then 
puts them away on the shelf without ever making the 
experiment of thoroughly putting into practice what 
has been so carefully thought out and set down by 
men of such experience as the authors of those 
volumes. 

I can add hardly anything to what they have 
written, but I can at least point out that if they were 
less criticised or neglected, and more acted upon, 
grouse driving on the average Scotch moor would be 
far more profitable to the owner and pleasanter to 
his friends. 

The matter is new to the Scotchman, and he is 
inclined for various reasons, to be alluded to presently, 
to view it with little favour. But if he has to do it at 
all, he may just as well learn what remarkable results 
he may achieve by carrying it out systematically and 
properly. The new system must have a fair trial to 
be properly adopted or condemned. It is the head- 
keeper who must read the Badminton Library and 
master its details ; but how many keepers have ever 
had a serious book on shooting given to them by their 
masters, or enjoyed the chance of discussing such a 
work with anyone who understands it ? 

Take a simple instance like the colour of the flags. 
It has over and over again been urged that the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



'37 



colour of the flags carried by the head man should 
be different in colour from those the drivers carry, the 
flank men, again, having a distinctive flag of some kind ; 
yet you usually see flags served out indiscriminately, 
and it is consequently impossible at a distance for 
either the shooters or the drivers to tell where the 
centre of the line or the flanks may be. This the 
drivers, at least, embracing as they sometimes do a 





FIG. i. 



FIG. 2. 



mile and a half of line, ought to be able to do, and 
each one regulate his own pace and direction thereby. 
I would recommend white flags for the rank and 
file, and a red one for the head man or centre of the 
line, with red and white ones for the flankers and 
pointsmen. The white is the most visible on the 
moor, but the red and white ones, especially if made 
as in fig. 2, are very conspicuous, and therefore good 



138 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

for the flank men, while the solitary red one will be 
easily found in the centre of the line. 

Now, all these details are important, nay essential 
to success in driving. But if they are neglected, or 
obstinately combated by persons who have no know- 
ledge or not sufficient keenness to wish to realise the 
largest head of game that the ground is able to produce, 
then their grouse driving will always remain an unsatis- 
factory and haphazard performance, while every excuse 
except the real one will be advanced to account for 
the poor results achieved. 

To drive grouse unless they are driven properly 
I may say scientifically is a waste of time, money, 
energy, and temper ; and, as I have urged before, the 
detailed advice and instruction of initiated and expe- 
rienced authorities is far more necessary and useful to 
those who are taking it up under adverse or new condi- 
tions than to those who have studied it under more usual 
or favourable circumstances. Your horseshoe forma- 
tion, your good flanking and carefully placed butts, are 
far more necessary on a wild Scotch beat than on a flat 
and easily driven Yorkshire moor. Yet it is frequently 
made to appear as if all these things were considered 
immaterial by those who ought to study them most 
carefully, and would profit most by them. 

Now suppose the wind to be blowing directly 



SCOTCH DRIVING 139 

across the valley, and for I wish to take the most 
difficult instance rather against than with the course 
of the drive. Here your result depends entirely upon 
the disposal of the men and the conduct of the drive. 
You are driving along the face of a hill, and the cross- 
wind is blowing fairly strong from the ridge or crest of 
the hill downwards. The natural result of this will be, 
unless you manage properly, that birds flushed on the 
higher part of the face will be inclined to turn round 
and downwards, flying back high over the heads of the 
beaters. This is the danger to be guarded against. 
Once the birds have made up their terrified minds 
to do this they cannot be turned, neither could they 
turn themselves, with the strong breeze behind them, 
if they would. 

It therefore follows that this instinct of theirs must 
be guarded against from or before the start. The 
head man, with the red flag, starting from the centre 
point and heading straight for the centre of the line 
of guns, will, instead of having seven men on each side 
of him (I am allowing fifteen drivers and pointsmen, 
all told), have five on the windward and nine on the 
leeward side. 

I have made a diagram, which I hope will convey 
what I mean. At the bottom of the hill is the burn 
running along a deep gully. The butts extend at the 






I 4 o SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



point chosen from the burn to the ridge, the highest 
No. 8, being just under or on the ridge, as experience 
shows to be best. The drive widens out into a corrie 
or flat at the beginning, in which lie a large proportion 
of the birds, taking advantage of its sheltered posi- 
tion. In this drive there will be no pointsman or flanker 
near the guns on the windward side, while on the lee- 
ward side five or six of the men will be pushed along 
the burn-side before the drive begins, the efforts of 
the pointsman, standing on the highest knoll he can 
find, being supplemented by the man with the ponies, 
who can always be utilised as a flag nearer the guns. 
It is of supreme importance that this formation should 
be completed before the driving begins, and it must 
be borne in mind that the upper drivers, on the wind- 
ward side, will, in addition to the wind, have the added 
power of showing against the sky to the birds below 
them. Their movements must, therefore, be cautious, 
and they must not get too far ahead or make them- 
selves too conspicuous, as they might if it were a still 
day or they had the wind in their favour. 

When the base or centre, A, of the drive begins to 
move, all the men on the leeward or burn-side must 
come into sight at once, and the aforesaid men on the 
windward flank must creep under, not on, the ridge to 
get round the sheltered corrie without going very far 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



141 




FIG. 3. 



142 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

ahead of the centre. All the birds in this corrie if 
flushed by men behind them will hang right along 
under the ridge in the shelter, describing a curve 
which the force of the wind will impose upon them, 
and coming well over the guns in order to reach the 
alighting ground they make for beyond the line of 
butts. 

Now, if this drive be mismanaged in the archaic 
manner I alluded to before that is, with all the drivers 
in a straight line nearly every bird in it will be lost, 
except a few lying at the bottom of the corrie, who may, 
if flushed luckily, hang on under the ridge and come to 
the upper guns. But most of them will never come 
to the guns at all ; those in the upper part of the 
corrie will, many of them, slip out at the head, and go 
up wind into the next valley or shelter. Those lower 
down will, most of them, feeling the force of the wind 
directly they rise, bear away over the burn and either 
remain on the other side beyond the stone wall, or 
curve in again if this ground is not moorland towards 
the alighting ground beyond the line of guns, without 
giving a shot. Many others, hearing the guns in 
front, and seeing nothing to stop them on the burn- 
side, will rise in the wind and go clean back towards 
the point B. The drive will consequently be an utter 
failure. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 143 

Again, if driven in the ordinary horseshoe shape, 
with both flanks equally forward, a lot of birds will be 
lost, still owing to the curve they will describe be- 
cause of the wind, at and between the points D and 
D. Besides this the flankers on the ridge side, espe- 
cially if showing strong against the sky, will turn back 
any birds which get up below and behind them, and 
these will again make away over the drivers' heads to 
the point B. The only birds which will come well to the 
guns will be those that rise in the middle, having 
caught sight of the burn-side flank and not seen the 
ridge flank. But the drive will not be a success, 
half the birds not having come forward to the guns, 
and what is worse, the next drive, in which these birds 
are counted on to make a still better one, will be 
spoilt also. 

In giving this illustration I have endeavoured to 
take an instance of a typical drive in a Scotch glen, 
and founded it not upon any one place in particular, 
but upon the common or usual characteristics of such 
ground. 

To drive the same piece with a cross-wind from 
the opposite direction that is, blowing up the hill is 
an easier matter, and I do not think requires a fresh 
diagram. The flankers along the burn-side need not 
be so numerous or conspicuous, though this wing 



144 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

must still be pushed on a little. The general tendency 
of the birds in this wind will be either to creep across 
the wind and up the hill, or to turn back as before 
over the beaters, making their exit in this instance 
somewhere over the point A, instead of towards B. 
The flankers on the ridge side will this time be the 
important people, and will have more to do. They 
must push more forward than the other flank, and 
coming along over or above the ridge turn those birds 
which are inclined to go over gently on to the guns. 
This will not be difficult to do, provided they are 
stationed there in time, but as the birds are flying up- 
hill, and the wind slightly more against them than 
with them, it will be time enough to turn them after 
they have topped the ridge. This is the reason 
why they should, as I said, be themselves over or 
behind the ridge ; the birds will then swing down 
from them in a fresh curve and come over the upper 
guns, hanging a good deal in the breeze and giving 
easy shots. If the men came in full view along the 
ridge, they would turn a good many of these birds 
back over the centre A. 

In both these drives the butts numbered 4 to 
7 will probably have the most shooting, though as 
the lay of the ground varies in detail, as well as the 
points from which the birds have been flushed, so will 



SCOTCH DRIVING 145 

the curve described in the former drive vary also, and 
the lower guns may possibly be the most favoured. 

Now, in this drive I have depicted a sharp ridge 
on the upper, and a stout wall or boundary to the 
moor on the lower side. 

But without supposing any change in the shape or 
configuration of the ground, we may note a few altera- 
tions in the formation of the beaters which would 
become necessary if some of its characteristics were 
different. For instance, if instead of the sharp or 
rocky ridge you have a rounded shoulder, merely 
enlarging the area of good lying ground over the top 
and extending to a more or less flat district with good 
spaces of shelter probably ending at a march of 
watershed higher up ; in this case, unless too much 
raked by the wind, a good many birds will be lying on 
the upper flat, and some more on being flushed in ther 
corrie will be inclined to make up to it against the 
\vind. 

What I have termed the ridge flank must there- 
fore be extended before the drive begins beyond 
the point E, and may want an additional man, who 
had better be spared from the other flank between A 
and B. This flank must now take great care to get 
right round this upper ground, especially as most of 
the birds lying on it will probably be old ones, which 

L 



146 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

it should be your invariable object to kill if possible, 
and instead of coming along under the ridge as in 
the first instance suggested, take a wide circuit round 
from E to F and approach the guns in a direction 
about from F to G. By this means the drivers will rake 
in all the birds on the upper ground, and as they will be 
far enough over the shoulder not to show on the sky 
line, they will not turn back birds flushed below on 
the face. They must go warily, and the burn-side 
flank and centre must go slowly, to give them time 
to get cleverly round. 

Again, if on the lower side there is no stone wall 
or boundary to the moorland, but an expanse of 
equally good ground across the burn, it will be ne- 
cessary to extend the lower flank and sweep some 
of this ground in, always, however, keeping the flank 
extremely forward, practically joining on to the 
pointsman, on account of the wind. In this case the 
lower butts should get better shooting, and it may be 
well to have an extra butt across the burn in a line 
with where I have shown the ponies. 

In this diagram I have made curved lines showing 
the probable direction and curve of flight birds would 
take from where they are flushed to the alighting 
ground, those flushed very early in the drive in some 
instances settling at the points x. On rising again 



SCOTCH DRIVING 147 

these birds would be taken with the wind down to 
the lower guns, in the beginning of a new curve of 
flight to fresh alighting ground farther off. 

Now, the higher level of ground which I imagined 
above, and which is the most frequent accessory con- 
dition to a Scotch moor, embracing as it sometimes 
does a large part of the acreage of the shooting, on 
which there is little or no heather, but large expanses 
of grass varied with deep and barren peat bogs, and 
interspersed with rocks, caves, and gullies, yet not high 
enough to fairly reach the haunts of the ptarmigan, 
the eagle, and the fox the level, in short, that is 
known as 'the tops,' rather than the 'high tops ' is 
an important factor in Scotch driving, and from the 
point of view of improving your moor must be 
carefully considered. 

On these heights almost invariably throughout 
Scotland, but more especially where no driving has 
ever been systematically tried, abides a race of old 
grouse, of wary and predatory habits, amatory and 
pugnacious dispositions, evasive and exclusive conduct. 
Now, these old stagers it is of the utmost importance 
to destroy ; but to do so is no easy matter. It is my 
firm belief that the presence of these useless, and it is 
no exaggeration to say destructive, birds has a great 
deal to do with the scarcity of broods, and the low 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



average of stock to be found on elevated Scotch 
shootings. It is well known that in deer forests, 
where the great object is to get rid of grouse, the best 
means to arrive at this end is to leave them alone 
altogether. The result is that in a great measure they 
die out ; at any rate, their numbers dwindle to the 
lowest possible point. There are two reasons for 
this : one that the race becomes vitiated and reduced 
by in-breeding, the other that the older birds interfere 
with the matrimonial arrangements of the younger, to 
the prejudice of the offspring. 

The latter evil prevails more than the former 
among the birds I have mentioned as inhabiting the 
higher portions of Scotch shootings. In the pairing 
season the old warriors come down from the heights, 
fight with and vanquish the younger ones, and absorb 
the young hens ; the latter lay nests full of eggs, but 
they are sterile ; while the more youthful and capable 
cock bird, who would become the parent of a healthy 
brood, is either driven off the ground altogether or 
obliged to remain in a state of combative celibacy. 
The old hens also, who are beyond the age of laying, 
attack any young hen who may nest near them, driving 
her off her nest, thus causing the eggs to get cold and 
the incubation to be abortive. 

The old barren hens are bad enough, but the old 



SCOTCH DRIVING 149 



cocks are the worst, and both must by some means 
or other be destroyed. You would never dream of 
keeping birds of this age in a poultry yard for 
profit, where the inevitable test of /. s. d. forces you 
to be practical. Why should you allow this loss of 
stock on your grouse moor? We must therefore 
condemn them ; but how is the sentence of death to 
be carried out ? It is not easy. The nature of the 
ground they frequent in the shooting season, and 
their alert and wily habits, sentinelled as they are 
during their baskings and feedings, tortuous and swift 
as is their flight, are ample protection against the 
ordinary methods of the average shooter, keeper, and 
brace of dogs. I would rather poison them than 
have them on my own ground, and on expressing this 
revolutionary idea to a friend of mine, one of the best 
known living authorities on such subjects, I was 
delighted to hear him cordially assent. 

But as I have not studied the Borgian method, 
and am not therefore in a position to actually recom- 
mend it, I will confine myself to other and more 
practicable means. These birds could be immensely 
reduced in numbers, if not decimated, by indefatig- 
able stalking ; but this would consume an immense 
amount of time, involve constant disturbance of the 
other birds on the ground, and entirely engross the 



150 SffOOTSNG THE GROUSE 

keepers' energies. The only method left is, therefore, 
to drive them. 

I have already observed that the average shooter, 
endeavouring to secure them in the ordinary way with 
pointers, would find them more than his match ; 
indeed, he would kill very few of them. I will go 
farther he would probably never see most of them, 
unless he were a very first-rate, keen-eyed, and active 
sportsman, and devoted much time, instead of dele- 
gating this to his keeper, to sneaking quietly up the 
gullies, and taking advantage of inequalities in the 
ground to creep upon them unawares. This method 
is often practised in the latter part of the season in 
Yorkshire, under the name of ' gruffing,' from the local 
term 'gruff,' signifying the little deep gullies in the 
moor along which the grouse stalker manoeuvres, and 
is very good fun. But as I have remarked, this takes 
so much time that it could only be effectively practised 
by those who reside all through the season close to 
their own moors. For the average grouse shooter who 
resides in the low country, and only visits the moor- 
land from August to October, it is not practicable to 
any effective extent. 

There is but one way for the sportsman to drive 
these birds. The average Scotch keeper does not 
believe that the stock of birds on his moor in a good 



SCOTCH DRIVING 151 



breeding season could be increased. I must beg to 
differ from him. He does not, as a rule, even know 
how many he has on the ground ; and the aforesaid 
packs of very old birds on the higher ground are to 
him a mysterious, unknown, and inaccessible quantity. 
He may walk all over the tops, with dogs or without, 
but unless he creeps and crouches like a stalker, and 
studies the instinct of the birds which causes them 
always to lie in the leeward or sheltered sides of the 
hills or knowes, peeping, with half his face and the 
whole of his body hidden, over the brows, and ad- 
vancing with noiseless tread, he will not even catch 
sight of these wary old fowl. Nothing will fairly show 
you what stock of grouse you have upon a moor except 
driving it ; and unless you drive the whole of it, 
especially late in the season, you can never be sure 
what is the quantity of birds left behind or outside 
your drives which you may not have seen. If you 
are petermined, whatever your conditions, to kill the 
majority of your birds over dogs, you still ought to 
drive the tops, and do what you can to reduce the 
regiments of antique fowls which inhabit them You 
are not asked to eat them ; they will do to send to 
your friends (?), or to swell the market which supplies 
the suburban taste for game through the medium of 
third-rate restaurants ; but kill them if you can. 



152 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

On a Yorkshire moor you are driving on the tops 
all the time. If there is a high point on the moor, 
rocky and precipitous, it is in extent probably a mere 
fraction compared with the acreage of good moorland 
around it. On a Scotch moor you have usually a 
large acreage above the line of your highest driving 
ground, but you rarely, if ever, see the tops driven. 
The two accompanying sketches may help to suggest 
the difference of conditions to the eye. In fig. 4, 
' Yorkshire,' you have a supposed rough outline of 
an extent of moorland, the horizontal line showing 
(in both drawings) the highest level reached by your 
drivers. In fig. 5, ' Scotland,' you will observe that 
as you only drive along the hill-faces where the heather 
is good, this line lies below a large tract which I have 
marked as 'tops,' dominated at the back by the 
ptarmigan hills or deer ground. It is the birds on 
the ' tops ' that must either be absorbed into your 
usual drives by extended manoeuvres, or made the 
subject of special drives on intermediate days, with 
extra lines of butts for the purpose. 

To my thinking, much more could be done than 
is usually attempted by the former method. I would 
suggest that the drivers should be on the ground a 
long time before the guns are in position, and should 
sweep across the tops, driving all upon them on to the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



153 




154 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

lower ground, before they form line for the individual 
drives. Two men at least more if available should 
then be told off who would keep on the high ground 
all day, always walking across it, keeping the birds 
from finding refuge there, and constantly pushing 
them on to the lower faces. This would be a very 
effective method, and I have never taken part in driv- 
ing on a Scotch moor, whether in Aberdeenshire in 
the palmy days of 1872, or on a west-coast shooting 
in more recent and inferior seasons, without feeling 
that the ground, without some such manoeuvre as this, 
was not being properly covered, and that the birds 
had a shade the best of the contest. 

Late in the season the birds all over the ground 
will pack, and unless you can get at these packs and 
break them up your sport is poor ; they will after 
they have been driven a few times betake themselves 
bodily to the tops, leaving you with nothing but a 
few stragglers all young birds to make your bag 
from. 

Not having a moor of my own, and feeling, there- 
fore, that in spite of varied experience on other 
people's ground I am still liable to the criticism of those 
who own moors, and who might think that my remarks 
are not practical or applicable to their particular cases, 
I have been at the pains to obtain an exhaustive 



SCOTCH DRIVING 155 

account of what has taken place on the moor which, 
up to now, has beaten all the records in Scotland. I 
allude to the estate of the Mackintosh at Moy Hall, 
Inverness. This gentleman has been kind enough to 
send me a very exact record of the progress of his 
moor from the days when no driving was done until 
the present time, when he finds himself able to rival 
the records of most of the English moors with very few 
exceptions. My readers will, no doubt, find it difficult 
to believe that I have not founded what I have written 
above upon the account which the Mackintosh has 
been good enough to send me. I can only, therefore, 
give them my word that I have not the pleasure of 
knowing that gentleman, that I have never set foot 
upon the Moy Hall moors, and that all the foregoing 
pages, in which I have endeavoured to show how the re- 
sults of Scotch moorland could be improved by driving, 
were written before receiving this admirable paper. I 
may, perhaps, be allowed to say how gratified I feel 
to find that the Mackintosh's narrative of experience 
so closely corroborates what I have urged myself. 
The matter which he has sent me, and for which I 
cannot sufficiently express my gratitude, is so excellent 
and practical that I think I cannot do better than 
print it in extenso: 



156 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

Moy Hall, Inverness : November 30, 1893. 
This moor contains about n,ooo acres, and lies in 
Strathdearn, in the valley of the river Findhorn, at an 
altitude of 1,100 feet above sea-level. It is nearly 
square in shape, and the surface is undulating and 
pretty smooth. It is very well watered by springs 
and burns, and lies to the sun. As it has been in the 
proprietor's own hands since 1878, the heather is well 
burned all over the ground a matter of vital import- 
ance in keeping up a large stock and insuring healthy 
birds. Too many moors are well burned in parts only, 
generally near burns, and the other beats neglected. 
Good burning can only be done on the high ground 
in exceptional years, and only then for a very short 
time, so that it is all-important to put on a large force 
of men to do this when the chance can be got. 
Little patches, but very frequent, should be the rule. 
This spreads the birds more, and prevents old birds 
from driving the younger birds off the strips when 
they are feeding. Then again, every care should be 
taken to make as much as possible of the water on the 
moor. Every trickle of water should be puddled 
up, and a succession of small drinking places made. 
Nothing can be worse in a dry rearing season than 
to have all the birds crammed together in one or two 
places. In fact, as in modern warfare, the spade has 



SCOTCH DRIVING 157 

as much to do with obtaining good results as the gun 
has. What with looking after the springs, altering 
and repairing the butts, the spade is not out of the 
keepers' and watchers' hands from April till August. 
Another matter of vital importance is the killing down 
of old cocks. These worst of vermin can always be 
killed in November in certain favourite places. Every 
old cock killed then is worth a good many eggs in the 
following spring. The head keeper alone should be 
entrusted with this work, however. On too many 
Highland moors not nearly enough trapping is done 
for the smaller vermin, such as stoats and weasels. 
The traps should be left standing so long as they can 
spring. 

In the opinion of the writer the cause of there 
having been so many disappointing seasons on a great 
many moors of late years is because what should be 
the breeding birds are killed early in August, and 
gradually a worse and worse class of bird is left. 
Grouse in many places have not laid the large number 
of eggs they used to go, even though the seasons for 
nesting have been very good. The large shootings 
which existed, say, in the Seventies have been broken 
up into smaller ones, roads and paths made to the 
distant beats, and as nowadays everyone shoots 
' pretty well,' too often the old birds escape and the 



158 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

young birds are bagged. Especially is this the case 
with moors which are let from season to season, and 
nowadays the new class of shooting tenant does not 
much care about a lease. To give these moors a 
chance they should either be let on lease for a limit 
of birds, or else rested for a season, and then judi- 
ciously shot over. Where the moor is in the owner's 
hands or let on a long lease the case is different. If 
a man is very fond of dogs, pointers and setters, by 
all means let him use them; but if he wants to give 
the greatest amount of pleasure to the largest number 
of his friends, then let him harden his heart and make 
his moor into a 'driving moor,' not shooting over 
dogs at all, except perhaps in some odd corner or 
two. He can really get far more pleasure, and profit 
as well, if he sees his dogs broken himself before the 
shooting season, and then sells them to the public or 
to such of his friends as wish to shoot over dogs. 
There can be no manner of doubt that, once dogs are 
given up and regular and systematic driving taken 
to, the stock of birds is doubled or trebled, and, better 
still, the average healthiness of the birds is raised. 
This can easily be seen if there is a ' driving moor ' 
next to a moor which is ' dogged.' On the Moy Hall 
moor there has been practically no disease since 
1873- 



SCOTCH DRIVING 159 

Driving was first resorted to in 1869, and only 
then when the birds were too wild to sit to dogs. On 
September 8, 1 869, the entry is ' We drove the birds ; ' 
the result for two guns was twelve grouse not much, 
but a beginning. The next mention is on August 30, 
1870, when, with four guns, forty-two grouse were 
got by driving; and there are two other days in that 
year when the same number of guns shot twenty-seven 
and thirty-four birds. No attempt was then made to 
go over the main part of the moor. Driving was 
only resorted to on the flats and round the cornfields. 
Of course no butts were at that time erected. In 1871 
four guns got by driving 60, 57, and 121 grouse. 
On September 1 5, when the 121 grouse were got, the 
entry is, ' Everything went well ; we got fifteen brace 
at one drive, and eighteen brace at another.' 

In 1872 there is the first entry of the individual 
scores of the guns. Twenty-nine birds was the highest 
score. In the years of 1871 and 1872 the total num- 
ber of grouse killed during the season was 2,836 and 
3,002 (birds). 

From 1876 to 1879, owing to the moor being let, 
no driving was done. In 1879 this form of sport 
was regularly taken up : and on September i, 103 
grouse were killed in six drives. The highest score 
at one drive was thirteen birds for forty-three shots. 



. 

160 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



During this season there were fourteen days of 
driving ; the best day of the season on Moy Hall 
was 162 grouse. On the adjoining moor of Meal- 
burne, belonging to the Mackintosh, on September 
10, 270 grouse were killed in one day's driving by 
ten guns. This moor is peculiarly suited for this 
kind of sport, and up to date of 1893 the largest 
one-day's bag in Scotland, 454 brace, was got by nine 
guns. During 1879 the bag at Moy Hall was 5,172 
grouse, showing how much the driving had done to 
secure birds which would otherwise never have come 
to the gun. On September 13, 1883, the first record 
of over one hundred brace for one day was got, 255 
birds being bagged by eight guns. During three suc- 
cessive days 540 grouse were got, or an average 
of ninety brace per diem. In 1884 an average of 
ninety-four brace was got for the first four days' 
driving, the best day being 256 grouse, and thirty 
birds being the highest score at one drive. 

In 1885, in the first four days' driving 527^ brace 
were killed. 

In 1886 the first four days' driving resulted in 
580 brace. 

In 1887, owing to the death of the late Lord 
Lovat when actually engaged in a day's sport, there 
was no shooting until September 19, when 1,608 



SCOTCH DRIVING 161 

grouse were killed in three. days, or an average for 
three successive days of 263 brace. One gun killed 
no less than eighty-two birds in one ' single drive ' 
on September 20, and had he been shooting with 
three guns would have got many more. His total 
bag for the same day was 143 grouse. The best 
drive of the day was 271 grouse. 

In 1888, during four days' successive driving, an 
average of 323 brace per diem was killed. During 
this season, which was a very good one, 5,822 grouse 
were killed on the moor. 

In 1889, an indifferent breeding season, four days' 
driving gave 777 brace. In this year grouse were 
shot over dogs for the last time. Up till that time 
the moor had been regularly shot over dogs until the 
end of August. 

In 1890 the first three or four days' driving re- 
sulted in 744 brace. 

In 1891 864 brace were got in four days, but 
there was much more shooting, as 1,806 brace were 
got in the season. 

In 1892, on September i, nine guns got 575 
grouse, and on the 2nd 803 grouse, the other two 
days of that week being so wild and stormy that 
there was no shooting. 

In 1893 2,642 grouse were killed by nine guns in 

M 



1 62 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



the first four days' driving, an average of 330 brace 
per diem. The best individual score for one day was 
184 grouse. There were six drives each day, and 
had the weather only been a little better, the results 
would have been much higher. 4,480 grouse were 
secured this season, all, of course, by driving. 

The writer considers that since 1888 there has 
been nothing like a brilliant season. This past season 
the birds have been healthier and better scattered 
than they have ever been. 

The great secret of success in driving is to select 
those places in the flight of the birds where they can 
best be killed. In Scotland this is far more difficult 
than in England, and no double drives, to give good 
results, are possible where the ground slopes, however 
gently. It is only on a dead level where a double 
drive is much good. The writer is all in favour of 
' massing ' the guns, and making the birds fly as con- 
centrated as possible In some of the drives the 
butts* are only fifteen yards apart, and in none more 
than forty-five yards. All the butts should be (i) in 
a dead straight line, (2) should be close together and 
well concealed, being invariably placed within gun- 
shot of a ridge in front when on a hillside, and, if on 
a flat, then the outside turf should be carefully placed 
at the front of the butt. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 163 



The writer is all against upright, built-up butts. 
These must be dark-looking, and the birds ' shy ' at 
them, without the least doubt. 

The butts should be half sunk, well drained, and 
perfectly invisible from the front. 

For driving, about thirty beaters and six side 
boys are used. Only single drives are taken, as the 
distances taken in are very large in some drives 
about three miles round the arc of the beaters. Not 
a word is allowed to be said, except by the head 
keeper, who is always in the centre of the beaters. 
The six side boys are placed in ' pegged-out ' posi- 
tions, and only use their flags on the down-wind side. 

Some of the drives are very peculiar. In the 'Top 
of the Delta,' which is about the best on the moor, 
the grouse are driven to the end of a sloping hill, and 
parallel, and not at right angles to the butts. By 
this way as many birds are shot coming from behind 
the right rear of the butts as from the direct front. 
The butts at this drive are very close to each other, 
and the bags made at it are large 350 birds, for 
instance. 

In another drive, 'The Rocks,' the birds are 
driven at first entirely away to the left of the line of 
butts, and at least half a mile to their left. When 
once congregated on a certain flat, they are then 

M 2 



1 64 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



' dribbled ' round a gentle slope at one side of this 
flat, the beaters hardly moving, but every one or two 
men moving from time to time as the firing mode- 
rates. 

In fact, the more ' dodgy ' a drive can be made, 
the more sport there is in seeing it done. Many of 
the writer's friends, who shot regularly on English 
and Lowland moors, describe the birds in the High- 
lands as being much harder to shoot. This, of 
course, is owing to the ground. In some drives 
birds come perfectly straight, either low, highish, or 
very high ; in others, on the same day and with the 
same wind, they will fly like snipe, with a wrench and 
twist which sadly upsets ' averages.' 

As regards scoring, the writer considers that the 
best fairest, and quickest way is to draw for butts, 
shift two each drive, and ask each gun after each 
drive is over, ' How many birds did you see fall to 
your gun ?' In these days of nitro powders everyone 
can see if he kills or not. If he does not know whether 
he has killed or not, he had better give up grouse 
driving. The total of that drive is then given to 
the gathering keeper, who then has some idea of 
what was claimed and what was picked up. As the 
drives aie all single drives, birds are easily gathered 
by the guns, and after they have left to go on to the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 165 



next line, the ground is well hunted, and far back, by 
a keeper. Not a shot is allowed to be fired except 
during a drive. Walking in line and shooting home, 
as is often done, does really more harm in frightening 
birds than any amount of driving. 

The shooting at Moy Hall, in a fairly good year, 
is as follows : 

First week, about third week in August ; second 
week (after one week's rest only more is useless), 
about first week of September these of four days 
each; another two days about September 21, and 
another two days about last of October. These last 
are, of course, ' sandwiched in ' with other kinds of 
shooting. The man who will kill most at his moor 
by driving will be he who (i) gets good guns to shoot 
his birds ; (2) who disturbs his moor least by small 
days or stray guns being enlarged upon it ; (3) who is 
constantly on the look-out for fresh hints given by the 
birds themselves. 

(Signed) A. MACKINTOSH OF MACKINTOSH. 

With most of the above I cordially agree ; in fact, 
the experience of so close a student and excellent a 
sportsman could not, for his particular ground, be 
improved upon. I cannot quite endorse what he 
says about built-up butts, having seen them work so 



166 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



well for a considerable succession of days. But even 
on this point one should, in considering individual 
moors, be open to conviction, and my solution of it 
would be that where on wild or rough ground such 
long drives are taken as are here mentioned, birds 
would be brought off their own ground entirely, and 
coming suddenly upon butts which they have never 
seen, would be likely to shy at them. At any rate first- 
rate sport has often been seen from both kinds, and so 
long as the sunken butts can be well drained I think 
there is a good deal to be said for them. 

Placing the guns so close as is advocated here 
seems to me to have disadvantages which on some 
moors would outweigh its advantages. Under any 
circumstances to concentrate the birds within so small 
a space is quite beyond the efforts of most Scotch 
keepers and drivers, although I admit that when once 
a perfect system has been established, such as obtains 
in Yorkshire, it would in some places be of great use 
to the bag. But in most Scotch drives the flight of 
the birds spreads over a wide space, requiring six or 
seven guns to cover it, and in such cases the flanks 
are sometimes as good as the centre. Again, having 
neighbours only fifteen yards off on each side of you 
would bother many people, besides destroying the 
feeling that you are free to shoot at any bird that 



SCOTCH DRIVING 167 



comes within range, which constitutes one of the most 
attractive features of grouse driving. 

The opposition of the keepers is, as mentioned 
above, a serious drawback to the success of driving in 
some parts of Scotland. With regard to this it seems 
to me necessary, while making allowance for the tra- 
ditions under which they have been brought up, 
and their dislike of change, not to lose sight of cer- 
tain interested motives which generally underlie their 
hostility to the new system. Scotchmen, though as a 
majority they vote on the Radical side, are by instinct 
the most conservative of highly civilised races. Their 
laws and customs, language and dress, show the tena- 
city with which they cling to the traditions of an 
ancestry of which any nation might be proud, and 
a gathering of the clans would to this day evoke a 
response which probably no cry could raise in any 
other country. 

In the training and management of dogs the 
Highlander has always shown himself to be particu- 
larly apt. He seems in some degree to share the 
keen instincts and finer qualities of the dog, and the 
devotion of the animal appears to bring out the gentler 
and more sympathetic side of the nature of the man. 
The pointer and setter, no less than the collie, the 
deerhound, or the ' dandy,' respond more faithfully 



1 68 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



on the average to the handling of a Scotchman than 
of his English counterpart. The best dog-breakers I 
have ever seen have been Scotchmen, and one cannot 
but admire their reluctance to abandon an art in 
which they excel for what is to them a more irksome 
and laborious manner of providing sport for their 
employers. 

But while we may and ought to sympathise with 
their genuine devotion to the dog, as well as the 
honest and painstaking assiduity which they bestow 
on the development of his qualities, we need not be 
blind to the fact that there is in the large majority of 
cases the interested motive which I mentioned above. 
They many of them think more of the bawbees than 
of sport, and fear they may lose under the new regime 
a source of profit which they enjoyed under the old. It 
pays very well to breed pointers and setters at some one 
else's expense and sell them for your own profit. The 
kennel of a Scotch shooting tenant is usually a heavy 
item of outlay to him, but in most cases a profitable 
business to his keeper. It is the fear lest they should 
lose this which influences most of them, and causes 
them to take refuge in the unworthy course of advis- 
ing their masters that driving is impossible on the 
moor, that they cannot get men, or that they will 
drive all the birds off the ground or kill too many 



SCOTCH DRIVING 169 

of them. Now, since this source of income to keepers, 
though not over honest in its source, has been, so to 
speak, legalised by the custom of two or three genera- 
tions, it seems to me both wise and right to com- 
pensate them to some extent if for your own pleasure 
or profit you do away with it. The obvious and best 
solution, unless you are prepared to raise their rate 
of wages, is to encourage them to breed and train re- 
trievers,*with a few spaniels or setters. Good retrievers 
are very scarce and fetch high values ; most grouse 
driving is deficient in interest as well as in result, to 
those who are fond of hunting dogs, for lack of them. 
The same keeper who has for years maintained a 
high-class kennel of pointers will soon take an equal 
pride in his retrievers ; and a couple or two of setters 
should still be kept for wild days on outside beats, or 
to assist in finding birds after the big drives. 

The dog-man, whom I have urgently recommended 
as a necessary ally in partridge shooting, is equally if 
not more necessary to well-conducted grouse driving. 
To him should be confided the task of finding all the 
dead or ' pricked ' birds which fall wide of the line of 
butts or far behind, and it should be his business to 
remove all excuse for the apparently innocent, but 
usually crafty, marauding to which some of our friends 
resort to supplement their bag. 



i;o SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

The third difficulty, that of getting enough men 
to drive, is in some places insuperable. But here 
we must remember that, as in the case of the kennel 
question, liberality will do a great deal. A frequent 
evil to be found in Scotland is that the shooting 
tenant, having given a rent out of all proportion to 
the value of his moor, becomes stingy in other matters 
to recoup himself for his bad bargain, and so between 
the two conditions he gets less and less sport as time 
goes on. 

As I have urged in another volume, 1 liberality to 
all concerned is an essential condition of a pursuit of 
pleasure such as shooting, and I have always noticed 
that those who exercise this quality judiciously but 
freely, and combine with it a firm and kindly discipline, 
get the best sport. This is eminently the case in 
Scotland, where the people, specially responsive in 
nature, will be grateful to you for the one and admire 
you for the other. 

Good wages, a hearty lunch, and a brake or other 
conveyance for drivers who have to come far from 
their homes, I have seen work wonders ; while with 
the contrary conditions I have witnessed a general 
mutiny, and more often a sulky recalcitrant spirit, 
which, carried into practical effect all day, has entirely 
' The Partridge. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 171 



spoilt the sport. Where labour is scarce and drivers 
difficult to get, it becomes the more necessary to train 
the few you have to intelligent driving. It is wonder- 
ful what can be done with a small number by taking 
shorter drives, and teaching the men to cross about 
that is, while keeping their relative positions in the 
line, to zigzag so as not to miss the likely bits of hold- 
ing cover. 

To sum up, I commend the study of driving to 
those who rent or own Scotch shootings, feeling sure 
that if by any of the means I have tried to indicate 
they can infuse a keenness for it into the people they 
have to deal with, commanded and directed by superior 
practical knowledge, they will be much gratified if not 
astonished by the result. 



172 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER IV 

ENGLISH DRIVING 

SOME twenty years ago Messrs. Blackwood did me 
the honour to publish in their well-known magazine 
an article I had written on grouse driving ; a subject 
of which I had considerable experience during the 
remarkable seasons of 1870-1871, and above all 
1872. 

In it I tried to portray grouse driving as it was, 
and is still, on English moors, and to defend and 
recommend it as a system alike the most attractive to 
the sportsman and profitable to the stock of grouse. 
Many letters followed my little effort, and one gentle- 
man, who disguised his identity of which I am still 
ignorant under the signature of ' W. C.,' fell foul of 
the advocates of driving, and of myself in particular, 
in the columns of the ' Field,' with all the artillery of 
envy, malice and uncharitableness, supplemented by 
an ignorance of the subject that was remarkable even 
among journalistic contributions to sporting literature. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 173 



Sentiment against this ' inhuman butchery ' so 
overcame Mr. ' W. C.' that his feelings found vent in 
poetry, and the lines in which he may be supposed 
to have summed up his peculiar views on the matter 
are really worth reproducing, if only as evidence of 
his literary power and sporting instincts : 

Let gay ones and great 
Make the most of their fate 

As from mantlet to mantlet they run ; 
I envy them not 
No, not a jot, 

If you give me my dog and my gun. 

I should have been concerned to see, even at that 
date, anyone who elected to run from ' mantlet to 
mantlet ' during a grouse drive, and the light of sub- 
sequent experience only tends to confirm the view 
which I held then, that a dog and a gun are almost as 
useful to a sportsman engaged in that pursuit as in any 
other, and none the less if, as appears to have happened 
to the fortunate ' W. C.,' they have been given to him. 
Mr. ' W. C.' finally crushed me with the remark that 
I was evidently more familiar with the pen than the 
gun, a compliment I enjoyed the more as I had 
never written anything for publication before, and had 
used a gun ever since I was strong enough to carry it. 

It is no longer necessary to defend grouse driving 
against this kind of onslaught, even when emanating 



174 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

from so powerful a source as ' W. C.,' butthis gentleman 
was only one of many who always attacked anything 
like well-organised shooting or large bags, partly be- 
cause they had no knowledge of such things, and 
partly because at that time they furnished almost the 
only ' copy ' which editors of journals could procure 
on shooting matters. 

Nowadays all the best performances and records 
are pretty well known, most of them having been 
published in books or newspapers, and I think the 
Badminton Library has finally silenced the class of 
criticism so ably represented by my friend ' W. C.' 

The journey to the English moors, picturesque as 
it is, has details of a different character from those 
described in a previous chapter ; and what is a very 
important fact, the travellers are much more numer- 
ously recruited from local sources. 

The Manchester man and the Sheffielder, the 
dalesman and the tyke, are devoted to their grouse 
driving, and as proud as possible of the great bags that 
have made their moors so famous ; while their love 
of the sport is largely shared by the lower classes in 
the North of England. Herein lies the great difference 
between English and Scotch driving, as well as the 
secret of much of the superiority of the former over 
the latter. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 175 

It takes a great deal to astonish a Yorkshireman ; 
this is one of his most distinctive attributes ; and if 
any competent Yorkshire authority such as Lord 
Walsingham or Mr. Rimington-Wilson told a man of 
York that an effort to kill 2,000 brace in one day was 
contemplated, he would be delighted, not surprised at 
the idea, and only ask for the privilege of helping to 
do it. There is therefore no difficulty about obtaining 
drivers, and those of the most willing sort. Many of 
them will be glad to help without any payment, and 
the older hands among them will have besides a 
complete knowledge of the mysteries of flanking, wind, 
&c., a shrewd judgment of the comparative merits of 
the shooters engaged, and often a wager on the 
probable scores of their favourite champions. Last 
but not least, if the head keeper is a good man, 
they have implicit confidence in, and great respect 
for, him and his prowess ; and as a consequence 
he can keep them all under discipline, and turn 
them all to account in the management of his 
birds. 

It will readily be seen what an important factor 
this spirit among the inhabitants becomes towards the 
success of those great days on the more renowned 
moors, which seem to provide an ever-recurring sense 
of wonderment even to those who have often taken 



1 76 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

part in them, and to be absolutely incomprehensible 
to those who have not. 

Many a time, in other parts of England or in 
Scotland, have I felt that it would be wiser to be silent 
concerning these phenomenal deeds, and that my 
character for veracity or honesty would never survive 
the relation of even half what I had often seen. I 
have never forgotten a lesson I received when, as 
a youth at a private tutor's in Oxfordshire, I used 
to be asked to take a laborious part in the slaying 
of from ten to twenty brace of partridges in the com- 
pany of seven or eight old farmers. I had returned 
to my tutor's after the summer holidays, during 
which I had been fortunate enough to be allowed 
to take a gun in a day or two's grouse driving on 
the moors of Mr. Walter Stanhope at Dunford 
Bridge. When the Oxfordshire farmers asked me 
where I had been, I said ' grouse driving.' This con- 
veyed very little to them, but one of them lazily asked 
what sort of a bag we had made. I naively replied 
the truth, from 150 to 170 brace each day. We had 
just finished lunch, and our morning's bag of 7^ brace 
of partridges and a hare was proudly laid out near us. 
But this reply of mine cast a gloom over everything, 
and one of these sandy-haired, beefy-faced veterans 
laid his hand on my shoulder and said, ' Ah, young 



ENGLISH DRIVING 177 

man, when you be older, you'll know better than to 
tell such tales as that to a lot of men.' 

Many years after, a servant of mine, a veteran of 
the navy and the Taku forts, and afterwards of the 
London Fire Brigade, had to fight for his life in a 
Scotch lodge because he had incautiously related, and 
on this occasion quite truthfully, the results of a week 
at High Force, where he had just been with me, and 
where we had averaged 600 brace a day for four days. 
Previously nettled by his disparagement of Scotch 
moors as compared with English, the local champion, 
who happened to be the coachman, was fairly roused 

by this astounding record. 'Ye're a d d leear,' 

he cried, and fell upon the Southron. They were 
separated, but not until Flodden and Bannockburn 
had been fought over again, and the gun-room floor 
was covered with blood. 

These things are more widely known now, but I 
misdoubt me that many a Scotch keeper who listens 
with open-mouthed gravity to the tales of Studley and 
High Force, Broomhead or Wemmergill, conceals 
under the politeness of the Highlander an incredulity 
which cannot be shaken, and which deters him for ever 
from any effort to emulate such fabulous achievements, 
or eclipse the respectable moderation of the records 
of his own glen. 

N 



178 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



Although the opposition to driving mentioned 
above is now out of date, there are still many people 
to whom the mere making of a large bag appears to 
constitute a source of irritation. I have never been 
quite able to understand this frame of mind. There 
is nothing to prevent such a man from making a small 
bag if he wishes it, either on his own or his friend's 
ground, and surely he might remember that those 
who take part in these (to him) colossal days are, for 
the most part, just as keen and accomplished sports- 
men as himself. From the days of the great Hawker 
until the present time, all the evidence tends to show 
that when a man is once out with a gun he will in- 
variably kill as much as he can. The man who will 
come home early in the day for fear that he should 
kill too much game is a person whom, at any rate, 
I have never met, and in whose existence, I must 
confess, I find it difficult to believe. But there is 
one point of view on which I should probably agree 
even with the unrelenting opponents of large bags. 
I do not think it desirable for boys or youths to take 
part in them until they have been properly trained to 
the contest between themselves and the animal they 
are pursuing, which constitutes the true definition of 
sport. A boy who is learning to shoot may be taken 
out grouse driving once in a way, but it is far better 



ENGLISH DRIVING 179 

that he should serve his apprenticeship in the pursuit 
of grouse by walking, stalking, or shooting them over 
dogs in the usual manner. When they are very wild 
he will, no doubt, if left to himself, organise little im- 
promptu drives with the few men who may be out 
with him, and in the course of a windy day he will 
get many shots which will teach him something of 
the calculation necessary to kill a driven bird. To 
partake in the pleasure of a well-organised shoot which 
produces a large total is not necessary to human hap- 
piness, however keen a shooter a man may be, but 
it is one of the delightfully exciting incidents of one's 
life ; and if the moor, manor, or covert produces 
naturally a large stock of game without doing harm 
to any individual, it is surely better to realise from it 
to the proper extent. This result will not be achieved, 
as I mentioned before in the first volume of this series, 
by anyone not educated to all kinds of shooting ; and 
the raw youth who has never pursued birds on his 
own account, nor handled a dog, nor trained himself 
to shoot carefully and accurately, but, on the other 
hand, has been allowed by too indulgent elders to 
take part in big days until he is nearly blase with 
heavy firing, is neither a desirable object nor a 
pleasant companion. I am glad to think, however, 
that these are the minority, and that the English lad 

N 2 



i8o SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



is still keen enough, as a rule, to go out on his own 
account, and show his prowess in circumventing and 
securing birds without the aid of an array of beaters 
or drivers. 

Let me conduct such a one with me on to the 
moor, and, presuming that he already knows some- 
thing of the habits of the grouse, of the handling of 
his gun, and of the ways of his retriever, let me see, 
with all diffidence, if any hints that I can give will be 
of any service to him. 

Now mount your pony, and let us be off together. 
The other guns will follow soon, and we shall, at any 
rate, be first on the ground and into our places early. 
The drivers will start three miles from the first line 
of butts by time. It is, therefore, important that we 
should be on the spot punctually, or the birds will be 
coming over before we are there. Look to your girths 
before you get up, or your saddle may go round with 
you, and leave you in the middle of the road as we 
go down the hill. Through the little village we clat- 
ter, hustling the ducks and chickens out of the road- 
way, at that short and uncomfortable canter which 
appears specially to distinguish the hill pony. Round 
the bend at the end of the street, almost grazing our 
knees against the stone wall, as our ponies hustle 
round the sharp turn, over the grey bridge that spans 



ENGLISH DRIVING 181 

with its single arch the narrow, but violent, torrent of 
the beck, brown and swollen from last night's rain 
and once on the opposite side the ascent begins, the 
road widening out here and there into a green lane 
or common, where the geese hiss and cackle at us, 
barely floundering away from under our horses' feet. 
We begin to leave the region of the sycamore, the 
mountain ash, and the larch, while the foxglove and 
blackberry grow scarcer by the roadside. Now we 
emerge into a great inclosure of, say, a hundred acres, 
in which, though there are still patches of succulent 
green pasture, dotted with mushrooms or here and 
there spots of grey stone peeping through the sward, 
the coarser grasses and rushy tussocks of the moor 
begin to predominate. A whole herd of young cattle 
come dancing round us, and the temper of the old 
bull who watches us, sulky and motionless, as we 
ride by, is a source of inward anxiety, until we reach 
the gate in the high wall which is the boundary of the 
real moor. Now we are fairly in the open and on 
the heather, a flock of anxious peewits hovers close 
round our heads, screaming and turning over in the 
air ; the wheatear evades us in a succession of short, 
jerky flights, curtseying at us in derision at each pause 
upon a stone, and so, making our way through moss 
hags, over stones, and carefully round boggy places, 






i82 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

but still always ascending, we reach the first of the 
line of butts. Now dismount and take your gun. 
You have drawn No. 4 butt, which is sure to be a 
good one ; and as we walk up to it from here, you 
may kill a grouse, which, as the drivers are still miles 
away, can do no harm. 

' Yak ! kak ! kak ! ' from close underneath No. 2 
butt. Well done, very good shot ! but look beyond 
there up the face at all those birds rising and going 
back into the drive. No matter, they will come on 
again. There is plenty of time, and you may gather 
from where those birds rose, about three hundred 
yards away, how difficult of approach the Yorkshire 
grouse is even in the early days of August. But here 
we are at our place, so let us get in and be ready for 
action. Now take the centre of the butt yourself, put 
half a dozen cartridges in your right-hand coat- pocket, 
that you may be able to put one quickly into the gun 
in case your loader should not be ready with your 
second when birds are coming thick. Let him place 
his bag of cartridges, well open, on the seat in the 
left-hand corner of the butt close to his hand, and I 
will crouch behind him rather to your right. Neither 
of us is likely to jump up, so that you can swing 
the gun round with freedom on both sides to shoot 
behind. Look with care to the height of the front of 



ENGLISH DRIVING 183 



the butt it should be just high enough to shoot over 
in comfort when you are standing upright make it 
up with the spare sods lying about, and especially on 
the left-hand side, as from that side you will show to 
the birds against the sky, and you must keep low as 
they come up hill. Now lean both of your guns 
against the front of the butt, being careful in so doing 
that no little pieces of peat fall down the muzzle. 
Sec that the barrels of both are clear, and that both 
are loaded, and now let us take a good survey of the 
exact position of our next-door neighbours, and of the 
ground in front of us. Ours is the first butt under 
the ridge to our right, No. 5 being on the point of 
the ridge, and No. 6 beyond it out of sight. The 
three butts on our left stretching down the hill, No. i 
being the bottom one, all look at first sight to be 
better places than ours, but I think we shall find on 
examination of the favourable slack in front of us 
under the ridge that we shall get as much shooting 
as anybody. The sun is now quite hot. The grasses 
and heather buds on the ridge are waving and shiver- 
ing gently in the breeze against the bright sky. In 
the valley I can just hear the splash of the beck over 
the stones, and clearly as we can see every detail on 
the opposite slope, and the flat above it, and even that 
rocky ridge, crowned by the delicate blue of a far-off 



1 84 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



range, no sign of a driver's flag, with the exception of 
the two pointsmen not far off on our left, is visible. 

A hoarse exclamation, ' Lie down, will you ? ' from 
a loader to his dog, comes to us faintly on the breeze 
from the top butt ; a snatch of a skylark's song from 
the pastures, an occasional bark from a sheep dog in 
the valley, the single plaintive pipe of a young golden 
plover, seeming to come now from the flat in front, now 
from behind, and now from somewhere in the sky, are 
all the sounds that reach our ears. All is deliciously 
still, and the atmosphere, fragrant with heather buds 
and stimulating to the nerves, the brightness and 
purity of the light, with the enchanting prospect of 
heath and fell, of mountain and cloud, of the peaceful 
valley watered by a shining river, its humble interests 
all clustered round the grey church tower, and bridge 
of the little market town two miles away and five 
hundred feet below you, would be worth the journey 
up here, even if grouse and shooting did not exist to 
make it, to your eyes, complete. Faintly a very distant 
rattle, the well-known music of the railway, catches 
your ear, and there, creeping gently down towards 
the town, is the little toy train, tracing its accurate 
line in picturesque contrast to the windings of the 
river, and giving with its long soft trail of snow-white 
steam a new note of interest to the slumbering land- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 185 



scape. Toy-like as it appears from here, that is a 
northern express going at fifty miles an hour, and it 
has even now passed out of sight. 

There ! On the rocky ridge afar off is a flash of 
something white ; it is no, yes a driver's flag; there 
is another, showing black against the sunlit moor to the 
right yes, there they are, all or nearly all in sight, 
and in the shape of a perfect horseshoe. ' The birds 
will not be here for some time yet,' you say. No, 
but I should take my gun and be on the watch for an 
odd lot often comes over very early off the flank of 
the drive. Look out, here are birds ! ' Black and 
mysterious looking, a little pack of some five-and- 
twenty suddenly show on the ridge about a hundred 
yards in front. Rapidly and silently they come along 
the ridge straight for your neighbour, No. 5. Whistle 
to him, it is only fair play but it is too late, for him. 
Some hasty movement of his or his neighbour's 
beyond, and in an instant they have swerved and are 
coming right down on us. ' Take the first one.' One 
two well done ; that second one isn't down yet, 
but badly hit ; ah ! there he comes, stone dead I 
should say, just this side of that little knoll with the 
shining bit of white grass below it. I shall get him 
for you all right after the drive, when we hunt the 
ground behind. By this time you are very much on 



186 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the look-out, and so I now see are our neighbours, 
but there probably won't be any more for some little 
time. That little pack were all old birds, sitting on 
some bare place upon the ridge, and had got up 
thinking to sneak away long before the drivers came 
really near. And let me point out to you that, had 
your neighbour been ' watching out ' as we were, the 
lot would never have swerved, but would have gone 
straight by him, an easy chance ; whereas as things 
are, he is either unconscious or furious, no matter 
which, and you are a brace of birds to the good, 
which he will only put down as an item of your extra- 
ordinary good luck. 

Now keep a sharp watch, and especially to your 
left. The birds that come over the ridge on the right 
must show well against the sky, and those in front 
will tell black against the sunlight of the opposite face; 
but those that come up the hill from the left, having 
crossed the gully without our seeing them, will be 
creeping very low over the heather, so that with the 
sun shining on their bodies they will be very difficult 
to see against the ground, and get right up to us un- 
awares, unless we are careful. Here they come, just 
from the point I warned you of, seven or eight of 
them, close to the top of the heather and very slow, 
for they have a little wind against them, have come a 



ENGLISH DRIVING 187 



long way, and are flying up hill. The slant of their 
course will bring them obliquely across you, heading 
straight for No. 5 and here is a good chance to get 
four with your two guns. Take the outside one on 
your right, they are sure to swing away a little when 
you fire, but those on your left will still cross near 
enough to deal with easily. Good ! he is stone dead, 
the second also, an easy cross shot straight in front, 
the third a miss, though an easy chance, and the 
fourth cleverly dropped by a longish shot just as they 
were swinging back all together. No. 5 kills one, close 
to your last, for they are now almost in front of him, 
and they are gone ; back over the ridge. 

That third shot was a pity, and arose from too 
much haste and flurry in changing your gun ; quite 
unnecessary, for there was really plenty of time, as 
there was another bird much nearer to you than the 
one you fired at with your fourth barrel. Bear this 
in mind another time. Here come two straight to 
you from under the ridge ; take care, for these are 
coming thrice as fast as the last, the side wind helping 
them a little, and rather higher. Slightly to your right 
they come over at express pace ; ah ! your first barrel 
was neither high enough nor forward enough, as you 
see by those little floating white feathers from under 
his tail, but swinging quickly you killed him well 



1 88 SHOOTING THE^ GROUSE 

with your second behind the line, and he has fallen 
stone dead in that patch of rushes by the little 
trickle of water. ' You ought to have had them 
both.' Yes, you ought, but the first barrel at a fast 
grouse at about twenty feet from the ground always 
demands just sufficient forethought to remember to 
lift the left arm well up and to shoot well over him. 

Now they are coming more frequently, and mostly 
very straight to us from the ridge to our right, and 
from the front. Look out again from the left you 
see those had got to within ten yards of you, coming 
from below before you saw them, and that is why, 
instead of getting at least three, if not four of them, 
all easy shots, you in your hurry missed your first, 
killed your second behind, and fired two most ridiculous 
shots at him with your second gun after they were too 
far off. Your eyes should run over all the ground in 
front of you, from the extreme right to left and back 
again, incessantly. Especially you should watch two 
points that where the ridge sinks into the skyline 
eighty yards ahead, and that on the left where they 
come creeping to you from below. You ought by 
now to be getting to know the instant a bird is 
in sight whether he is really coming to you or not. 
Observe how those that you first see in front of 
you nearly all swing with the wind down to No. 3 on 



ENGLISH DRIVING 189 



your left ; and on the other hand how the same curve 
in their flight causes all those which first show at the 
point of the ridge I just mentioned to come right 
on to you, though first seen straight in front of No. 5. 

Look out for those two in front, they are going to 
settle, and you should always shoot at a settling bird, 
even up to a longish range. You missed the moment, 
and probably the bird also. Just when he tucks his 
tail in, and is sinking down into the heather, with his 
wings open and neck and breast exposed, he is very 
vulnerable, and may be killed at a long way off. 
There, he has run on to that stone now take him 
sitting, it is better to put him up in any case, for he 
will only attract others to settle near him. Ah, you 
shot over him, and he is off. There is only one way 
to make sure of a sitting bird, a trick I found out for 
myself at pigeon shooting : aim carefully three or four 
feet under him, raise the muzzle gently till it just 
covers his toes, at that moment pull, and you will 
never miss another sitter. 

Now there is a fine lot they seem to be streaming 
at you from all points in front, there must be two or 
three hundred of them. Keep cool, take the one 
coming straight for the right-hand corner of our butt 
and who leads the pack, first. Well killed ! the second 
snapped rather too hastily in front, the third well 



1 90 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



killed ; but why, oh ! why did you turn round ? the 
fourth one you shot at and missed was ridiculously 
far, and then one nearly knocked your cap off mean- 
while. Again you change guns, and kill one out of 
two hastily shot at behind the butts, and as you again 
get your seventh and eighth barrels to work you find 
that birds have been streaming straight to you all the 
while, tailing off after the main body of the pack. 
Result five birds with your eight barrels, while, shoot- 
ing as well as you do, you ought to have very easily 
killed with all the shots and secured eight birds. As 
long as there are birds still coming on you should never 
turn round at all, but keep on plugging away always 
at those which catch your eye as coming easiest, and 
letting them get tolerably near you before firing. As 
in watching a first-rate professional at billiards you 
will be astonished at the number of easy strokes he 
gets, and notice how seldom he takes a difficult one, 
so a high-class performer with the gun will achieve as 
much by his rapid selection of easy chances as by 
accuracy of shooting. There will always be plenty of 
difficult shots during a drive on which to employ his 
more brilliant efforts, and which he will kill with all 
the more certainty from ' getting his eye in ' at the 
easy ones. But this is a part of the art that is hot 
learned in a day, even by the most brilliant natural shot. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 191 

Now here come three, one a little ahead of the 
other two and straight to you, the others abreast and 
a trifle to your left. Take the leader first, shooting 
rather soon, at what looks like forty yards, and with 
particular accuracy ; change guns quickly without 
firing the second barrel, and kill the other two with 
your second gun, one by sharp work just in front and 
the other an easy one behind. Good, you have got 
all three ; and no doubt you see the advantage of 
this manoeuvre. Had you stuck to your first gun 
after killing the first, you would have had to pause a 
little to get the next with your second barrel, and while 
you were changing guns the third bird would have got 
so far that you would almost certainly have lost him. 

Now the holloaing of the drivers sounds quite near, 
and in fact, though you cannot yet see them, for they 
are still climbing out of the gully and under the fall 
of the ground in front of you, they are probably 
not more than 150 yards off, a distance at which you 
may easily blind a man. You must now only shoot at 
birds a moderate height up in the air, or low to your 
right against the ridge, or behind. What remain are 
coming singly and easier, but look out for a small 
burst off the ridge, for remember we saw a good many 
settle there from time to time. There they come, 
but they won't quite face it, and hang back, giving 



192 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



long, high, crossing shots, and going clean back 
over the drivers. High, and well forward, and you 
have killed a beautiful double shot ; don't forget to 
pick these up afterwards, for they have fallen a long 
way from any of your other birds. 

The drivers are showing all along the line, their 
flags are rattling in the wind, and it is nearly over. 
Do you remember where that bird settled about sixty 
yards in front, just in that deep bit of heather ? They 
will go past him, for I don't think he has ever risen ; 
call to them, waving them to where he was. Yak-kak ! 
there he is, and as he comes straight on and rather 
high you have killed him easily and safely over their 
heads. He is about the last, and I think as the 
drivers are now only forty yards off, we may go out 
and pick up. 

It is better now to make the loader hold your dog 
until we have picked up all the dead ones near the butt 
on the burnt ground. It is bad for him to see so many 
dead on the ground and he will have had enough work 
by the end of the day. Having done this the man can 
go off after the bird we marked at the very beginning 
of the drive, which is quite dead, and you and I will 
look after the otheis with the dog, particularly those 
two or three which fell, not killed dead, near the little 
burnside. Twenty- seven you had down, besides one 



ENGLISH DRIVING 193 

of these not counted, which will probably rise again. 
Well, we must pick them all up. Now we have 
gathered twenty-one, and your loader has the far-off bird 
which makes twenty-two. Wait a moment till he re- 
joins us and is out of the way, and we will try for the 
three in the burn. Now be ready with your gun, and 
mind to work your dog up to them from this side, for 
right and left and behind us are men all over the 
place picking up, and unless we drive him away in the 
forward direction you will not be able to shoot safely. 
Ah, I see the dog winds him ; look out, there he is, 
and safely killed without trouble. One of the others 
proves to be winged, and to have run a long way down 
the burn till he is gathered right behind No. 3, but 
though the latter looks rather askance at us for being 
off our own ground, the bird was fairly footed by the 
dog all the way from where he fell. The third is 
lying stone dead in a little pool, so now we have 
twenty-five ; but stay, we had almost forgotten the 
two you killed right away in front, as they were turn- 
ing back. Now we have got both of them, though 
the second took the dog a hundred yards down the 
gully, leaving a long track of feathers like the ' scent ' 
of a paper chase on the tops of the heather. But 
where have we left the twenty-eighth ? ' We must 
have been mistaken,' you say, ' for we have hunted the 

o 



194 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

ground all over.' ' I beg your pardon, I am quite 
sure of my count ; so just look with me carefully close 
round the butt, where a bird often gets left. Here he 
)ies, down a deep rift in the peat, in a little stagnant 
pool of brown water, which is why he had no scent, 
almost hidden by overhanging heather, not five yards 
from the butt ; so there is our correct number. You 
can see from this the value of accurate counting, for 
without me you would certainly have gone away 
satisfied you had picked all up, and left that last 
bird to rot.' 

As we have not been called on yet by our host, we 
might just look at where the second of those two 
settled in front, for the one which ran on to the stone 
and got away was not the bird you fired at settling. 
I thought not, and there to our joy is the other one, 
not quite dead, crouching deep under the thick 
heather, and found very prettily by the dog. That 
was lucky, I thought you had missed him, for he 
seemed to drop all right into the heather. 

So we have made it up to twenty-nine, a fair good 
drive, and though your shooting was really very good, 
you must remember that on several occasions you 
missed the chance of easily getting more, merely by 
undue hurry, or not making the most of the position. 

Now we shift across, and rather uphill, about two 



ENGLISH DRIVING 195 



hundred yards only for the return drive. For some 
years we used to drive back over the same butts ; but 
grouse hardly ever return to any ground by the same 
line as they took to leave it, and here they always 
come back higher up, with the exception of a few 
lots which will return much lower down, and which 
it cannot be hoped to include in the drive. 

The reason of this is the wind the invariable 
factor in determining the line of the flight of grouse. 
This time they will be coming back off higher ground, 
the wind, though still across, being rather more behind 
them, an important fact to them, and with the sun 
also more behind them, an equally important one to 
you. You have now to keep, if possible, more care- 
fully on the watch than before, and from the first 
moment after getting to your place, for some will 
return to their own ground almost immediately. Here 
you must carefully scan the face of the hill opposite 
you, bothered as you are by the sun, now on your 
left ; for they will be very difficult to see against the 
dark rising ground, and come very fast. You will 
get no shots against the sky except at such as come 
high. 

They return on higher ground here for two reasons, 
one being that the majority of those in the last drive 
actually came off higher ground over the ridge to 

o 2 



196 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

your right than you supposed, which was swept in 
sideways by the flank, and to which they wish to re- 
turn ; and the other that the wind, the more imme- 
diate reason, being here on their quarter, they can the 
more easily slant across it, and are not obliged to 
curve round under the ridge, as they would do if it 
were at all against them. Remember that here they 
will all come very fast, and though nothing would 
really turn them, they will swerve and twist a good 
deal if you make hasty or jerky movements just as 
they approach you. This is another fruitful reason 
of the wonderful ' luck ' usually ascribed to a first- 
rate man. The duffer next to him exposes himself, 
bobs or shifts about, and turns many a bird from 
himself right towards the motionless form of his more 
accomplished neighbour, such birds 'counting two 
on a division ' as politicians would say. Here again, 
if they are coming straight, as most of them will, 
there can be no question of killing three or four, 
except out of a big or streaming lot. Make sure of 
your double shot, one in front and one behind, letting 
the first one come pretty close to you before firing, 
and swinging round like lightning for the second. To 
this end make sure that your footing is secure, and 
your loader so placed as not to interfere with your 
movements, for when birds are coming very fast down 



ENGLISH DRIVING 197 



wind you have to turn round with extreme quickness, 
and must be free in your movements, with your feet on 
level ground. When you come to the pick-up, bear 
in mind that your dead birds will all be much farther 
back than you would suppose, and that you will have 
none, except cross shots, in front of your butt. Take 
your dog right away back at once to a point a little 
farther off than your farthest bird, and then hunt him 
up carefully towards the butt, so as to give him the 
full benefit of the wind. 

In conclusion, never wait to kill a bird behind the 
line while it is possible to kill him in front ; but be 
careful not to dwell upon or follow birds coming into 
the line, this being the most fruitful cause of accident. 

Thus may one endeavour to instruct those who 
are beginning to practise this most engaging of all 
forms of shooting. There are a few further points 
I would urge, on some of which I must disagree with 
what has been written elsewhere, though I am against 
splitting straws with persons who have undoubtedly 
brought much study to bear upon the subject. I can- 
not agree with one well-known authority, who advises 
men never to shoot at birds which settle in front. I 
would always recommend shooting at them even up 
to seventy or eighty yards off. First, as remarked 
above, they can be killed up to a good distance ; 



198 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

secondly, because they will always attract others to 
settle near them. Whether the fresh arrivals detect 
the presence of those already there by sight or smell 
I cannot say, but it is certain that if birds have settled 
in front of you, and you do not disturb them, a great 
proportion of those following on after them will drop 
down to them. I have often seen them rise and 
come straight on over the guns after being shot at 
when in the act of alighting or sitting, showing that 
they did not detect where the sound proceeded from. 
Late in the drive, when the men are getting com- 
paratively close, it is better to leave them alone, on 
the chance of their coming forward : early in the drive 
always shoot; if they go back, they will probably 
alight again before reaching the drivers, and be forced 
forward a second time. 

When you are shooting grouse with one gun only, 
and a big lot of birds are coming to you, fire your two 
barrels early, duck down below the butt, and as long 
as there are still grouse within shot, put in one cart- 
ridge only. You will do more execution this way 
than by waiting to load both barrels. I once killed 
five birds out of one lot of about fifty in this manner, 
and I ought to have killed six, for I missed the third 
shot, about the easiest of all. I need hardly say they 
were coming slowly against the wind, and swerved a 



ENGLISH DRIVING 199 



little across me after the first shot, or it could not have 
been done. Keep your cartridges in your right-hand 
pocket, and have your bag on the seat, wide open, on 
your right, unless it is raining, when you must see 
them bestowed in the dry, but the strap of the bag 
left unbuckled ; and always feed your gun direct from 
your right-hand pocket. I must say that since giving 
them a fair trial I am distinctly in favour of brass- 
covered cartridges, and more especially for grouse 
driving, when one is. so often overtaken by heavy 
showers, during which the necessity for quick firing 
makes it impossible to keep them all dry. For those 
who use ejectors, they will be found, in the long run, 
an economy, in spite of their trifling additional cost. 
The ejectors of my present guns (Purdey's) have never 
been out of order but once, and that was when I got 
a sodden paper cartridge stuck fast, and used too 
much force to extract it. We usually have to pay a 
penalty for every improvement in this world, and the 
use of hammerless guns with ejectors is no exception 
to the rule. The mechanism of the piece is more 
complicated, and requires more care in cleaning and 
general treatment ; but with these precautions and 
brass-covered cartridges there is no reason whatever 
why guns of this improved type, turned out by a good 
maker, should get out of order. They should not be 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



cleaned with anything but vaseline, which never cor- 
rodes, and only a moderate quantity of that ; the 
great secret being to keep all accessible parts of the 
action as clean and dry as possible. A heavy-handed, 
ignorant under-keeper, whether English or Scotch, is 
rarely fit to be trusted with the handling or cleaning 
of such valuable articles as the best breech-loaders of 
to-day. 

Whatever may be said to the contrary, the general 
verdict of those who have the best opportunities of 
judging is in favour of the best guns by the best 
makers. You will often hear it said that these 
makers' charges for their best quality of guns are 
' outrageous,' and all sorts of ugly words applied to 
those whose position in the trade enables them to set 
the market price of these articles. I must put in a 
plea for the good gunmaker. It would be invidious 
to particularise, but there are several makers in Lon- 
don whose names are in everybody's mouth, and who 
turn out guns, undoubtedly high-priced, but which, 
to my thinking, are well worth the money. Everyone 
who knows anything at all of the subject, knows that 
the profit on the best quality of gun is not heavy, 
much smaller, in fact, than on cheaper articles 
of all sorts supplied by the trade generally, while 
most of the most valuable part of the work is not 



ENGLISH DRIVING 201 



visible, and would not be detected by the inex- 
perienced. A great deal of personal care, as well as 
honest and dearly paid labour, is expended on a pair 
of ' best guns ' by one of these firms ; and I fail to 
see why a man should grumble at giving, say, I4O/. 
or i5o/., or even more, for articles which, properly 
cared for, will last him his lifetime, and for which the 
demand is constantly and widely increasing. A well- 
built gun, besides its practical use, is, to a certain 
extent, a work of art, and it should be borne in 
mind that as an article of British manufacture it still 
holds its place against the competition of all other 
countries ; and that whether you care to give the 
price or not, there are plenty of Frenchmen Italians, 
Austrians and Americans, without reckoning our own 
colonists, who are ready enough to do so. The class 
of gunmaker I am alluding to is one who makes 
your piece to order, and specially to fit your 
individual characteristics, who pays very high for 
skilled labour, and bestows personal judgment and 
care, the outcome of actual knowledge of working 
at the bench, upon every detail of your order. There 
is another class, who advertise weapons of extra- 
ordinary cheapness, but are merely agents for great 
manufacturing firms, who have a large stock of guns 
always on hand, and stand in the same relation to 



202 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

those mentioned above as the reach-me-down clothes 
shop to the high-class West End tailor. These 
I cannot recommend. I must not conclude this 
necessary digression on choice of guns without adding 
that he who lives in the country entirely, and cannot 
afford the price of the first-rate London firm, will do 
better to employ a provincial maker of known re- 
pute. Of these there are several in England and 
Scotland of whom very excellent judges have reason 
to speak in terms of high praise, and whose work is 
far better than that of the wholesale heavily puffed 
firms, trading under assumed London names, who 
falsely profess to give you the same article as the good 
makers at one-third of the price. 

A few words on this subject have not appeared to 
me out of place in a chapter on grouse driving, since 
it is precisely in this branch of sport that guns are 
put to the most severe tests. The atmospheric con- 
ditions, exposing the workmanship of your piece to 
great extremes of heat, wet and cold, with the con- 
comitant condition of very heavy firing, rapid working 
of the mechanism, and maximum of expansion or con- 
traction of the metal, try the workmanship of a gun 
severely. A weapon which 'jams' in the middle of a 
good grouse drive would spoil the temper of an arch- 
angel. In the arrangement and conduct of your drives 



ENGLISH DRIVING 203 



I must repeat, with even greater emphasis, what I have 
said in the volume on the 'Partridge' concerning 
wind ; but you are far more in the hands of your head 
man and his drivers on this point than in any partridge 
drive. The latter have often to foot it some miles, 
even before you are out of your bed, to get to the 
remote point whence they will start the first drive. 
This involves organisation, since, living possibly some 
distance apart, they will not all start from the same 
place, and probably consist of two parties, each of 
which must be under a responsible lieutenant who 
thoroughly knows the ground. Consequently, should 
it be advisable to change the beat for the day on 
account of wind, or even the method of beating the 
ground, you must be able to rely absolutely upon the 
judgment and decision of your head man. 

It is almost indispensable that he should be a moor- 
land man, born and bred, though I admit that I have 
come across one or two notable exceptions to this. If 
he doesn't know the moors, literally up hill and down 
dale, every turn of the wind, every habit of the grouse, 
and every dodge of the driver, he is of no use to you 
in Yorkshire. He will command neither the confi- 
dence nor the obedience of his drivers, who, being 
all dalesmen who have travelled the moors and fells 
all their lives, know a good deal on their own account, 



204 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

and have it largely in their power to frustrate the most 
elaborate manoeuvres. If you have to select a new 
chief, it is far better to promote the most trustworthy 
of the men who have been driving on the moor for 
years, rather than to put a man over their heads who 
has been mostly used to low-ground shooting, merely 
because he is considered 'fit for a head keeper's 
place.' 

Very difficult manoeuvres have sometimes to be 
executed, and unless your moor is very large in extent 
it is only by the most delicate and experienced hand- 
ling, in which every man must honestly co-operate, 
that the birds can be kept upon your ground. Five 
thousand acres is not nearly enough to hold large 
packs in a high wind, unless they are very well ma- 
naged. Suppose, for instance, that a large number of 
birds are packed at the head of a valley and on the 
ridge, close to the march, and there is a strong wind 
blowing towards the march. Unless your men get 
round very gingerly, keeping out of sight as carefully 
as a stalker getting up to deer, on the down-wind side, 
the game is up, and possibly your whole day's spcrt 
spoilt. 

I have seen this very manoeuvre beautifully carried 
out, and even the birds, having somehow taken the 
alarm, rise and make a big circuit round near the march 




V 









ENGLISH DRIVING 205 



before the two flanks of the drive had met; the whole of 
the men on the windward side lay flat down the instant 
the birds rose, and that without a word of command. 
The pack settled down again, and the down-wind side 
got well round and brought them on over our heads. 
What would an obstinate Scotchman with recalcitrant 
drivers say to that ! 

If, again, the head man is one in whom his drivers 
have complete confidence, and who has trained his lieu- 
tenants to carry out his orders whether he is present or 
not, he can enjoy the inestimable advantage of placing 
himself on the flank close to the guns, or of going 
into one of the butts with his master or some other 
shooter, and observing the exact result of his plan of 
campaign, and what alterations, if any, should be 
made in the line of butts. It is also an excellent 
thing, should opportunity serve, to let him visit other 
moors where good driving is carried on, and where he 
may pick up a new wrinkle or two, or get rid of ideas 
which may be too local. 

I urge these points because it is impossible to in- 
oculate a man with the instinct which alone makes a 
first-rate grouse driver. The theory of the dis- 
position of your drivers, the horse-shoe formation, the 
placing of the flankers, and the method of progres- 
sion, is now thoroughly familiar to all immediately 



206 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

concerned in English driving. I have gone into it in 
greater detail in the chapter on Scotch Driving, in 
order, if possible, to be of use to those who wish to 
introduce it on Scotch moors, or to persuade such as 
oppose the system from ignorant, conservative, or in- 
terested motives, of its practical value to their ground. 

In the construction and placing of the butts a few 
points should be noted. The larger and more com- 
modious they are the better, seven feet square on 
the inside being about the most convenient size ; 
and there should be a seat of heather sods or flat 
stones in each corner. Some spare sods should 
always be cut and left close outside them, that there 
may be something for a tall man to build up his 
front wall with, should it be too low. The floor must 
be absolutely level and well drained. At Mr. Riming- 
ton Wilson's at Broomhead, on the Sheffield range, 
the butts have board floors, a great comfort to the 
shooters in many ways ; but on many moors the cart- 
ing of timber up to the butts would be impracticable ; 
and on this particular moor on the principal days the 
driving is all done to two lines of butts close together, 
one on each side of a little gully, which has probably 
witnessed the slaying of more grouse than any spot 
of its size in the British Islands. 

A point of extreme importance, for the safety of 



ENGLISH DRIVING 



207 



the shooters, is that all the butts should be ' dressed ' 
square with the line ; that is, that the front should be 
at right angles to the direction of the drive. I have 
often, when in a butt set askew, found myself bothered 
in the hurry of quick firing to remember the exact 
line, and on reflection am convinced that many of the 
accidents that have occurred in grouse driving have 




FIG. 6. 

been due to this cause. The diagram will perhaps 
explain what I mean. 

The butts A, B, c, together with the rest of the 
row not shown, are all on the line E E at right angles 
to the general direction of. the drive. Now the man 
in the butt B, though he will doubtless survey the 
position of his neighbours before the drive begins, will 



208 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

probably, after his attention has become riveted on a 
succession of approaching birds, begin instinctively to 
face the front wall of his butt. Being so used to 
finding his neighbours placed at right angles to the 
side walls of his butt, and on the same line as the 
front, that danger in this quarter has become a matter 
of instinct rather than observation, his brain will 
imagine them to be located on the line DD. This 
delusion may only last a moment or two while he is 
watching birds ; but it may lead him to shoot at a 
bird at the point F, and so seriously damage the 
man in the butt c, or on the other side to take a 
shot at the point G, imagining the bird to have passed 
the line, and so to injure the man in the butt A. 

I have no evidence to prove that accidents have 
occurred from this cause, but they have occurred at 
drives where I have seen butts placed in this manner, 
and I have myself been so near shooting my neighbour 
under these circumstances that it cannot be wrong to 
point out the possible danger. 

Let there be always plenty of butts on the moor, 
that you may be able to drive according to the wind. 
If in any drive you notice that two or three of the 
guns invariably get all the shooting, it is better to 
put two or possibly three in a second line behind 
them, being careful they are fully 200 yards off, any 



ENGLISH DRIVING 209 



less distance not being safe for the eyes of your 
friends. 

In the early part of the season it is better not to 
have too many drivers ; the birds which they pass by 
without flushing will be all young ones, precisely those 
required for breeding stock, and if they came on, as 
they would, at the end of the drive, singly and flying 
very slowly, they would all be massacred. If your 
moor is at the end of a spur of the greater range, you 
can always insure a good double drive by pushing 
them first to the end, next the cultivated land, and 
then bringing them back ; but in such a case your 
men had better sweep in some of the pastures below 
the end of the moor, on which there are sure to be 
birds. This formation of ground accounts partially 
for the certainty with which a large bag can be made 
on many moors, notably on Broomhead and Blubber- 
house. 1 In severe or bad breeding seasons the lower 
moors will suffer less than the higher, and as the 
former will be always fed, to a certain extent, by the 
latter, and have the advantage of them, it behoves 
the owner of moorland which is lower than his 
neighbours, and constitutes the end of a large ridge 
or stretch, not to be too hard upon the birds, especially 
late on in the season. Were he able to kill every 

* Mr. Rimington Wilson's and Lord Walsingham's respectively. 

P 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



bird upon his land, it would undoubtedly be re-stocked 
from the higher ground, and in the winter months, 
when mild weather prevails higher up, he is sure to 
have many more than his share upon his ground. 

The counting and picking up of the dead birds is 
a subject for serious consideration. I well remember, 
twenty years ago in Yorkshire, amongst a few of us 
who met constantly and whose comparative form 
would have been difficult to handicap, every day's 
grouse driving might as well have been a valuable 
sweepstake or a series of matches for ioo/. a side, 
so keen was the rivalry, the scoring, and the picking 
up. But I cannot say that it was a desirable state of 
things. The counting of what you have killed is no 
doubt necessary, but it might be done on the same 
principle as I have recommended for partridge driving, 
that is, keeping a score of the claims without putting 
them against any names. That which promotes keen- 
ness is good ; that which provokes jealousy is surely 
bad. The lines of pegs halfway between each butt, 
recommended by Sir R. Payne-Gallwey, were first 
adopted, I believe, upon a suggestion of mine at 
Broomhead some years ago, and Mr. Wilson has seen 
no reason to remove them since. To insure bagging 
all that have been knocked down, as well as in the 
interests of humanity, there should always be a pro- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 211 



fessional ' picker up ' in the person of a keeper with 
a brace or more of retrieving spaniels, who should 
hunt round the ine of butts after the guns have 
gathered all they can. An old pointer or setter is 
not bad for this work, but spaniels that will hunt close, 
if they are not too hard-mouthed, are better. Should 
you be a breeder of retrievers, here is a good oppor- 
tunity for your dog man to do a little breaking in ; 
and if they are well under control, there is no doubt 
they are the best of all. 

I well remember the first appearance of old John 
Young, Lord Londesborough's head man for over a 
quarter of a century, upon a West Riding moor in 
1871. He was supposed never to have seen a grouse, 
though a veteran in years and in experience of field 
and covert. He brought with him three of the most 
useful-looking brown retrievers to pick up his master's 
birds. Clad as he was in a heavy green velveteen 
coat with brass buttons, a red waistcoat, thick cord 
breeches, and gaiters, and an enormous gold-laced 
hat, he appeared to radiate heat and light on all 
around, and was a sufficiently striking object on the 
heather on a sweltering September day. He had 
about eight grouse in each hand, and his dogs were 
still diligently hunting, when we came across him, far 
away from his master's butt. We chaffed him on the 



212 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



fact that, though he was a novice to grouse, he seemed 
to be a pretty good hand at picking up. Laying down 
his birds, and raising the gold-laced beaver with an 
air peculiar to him, ' Never was on a moor before in 
my life, I can assure you, gentlemen,' he said, with 
perfect courtesy. Nevertheless, he had gathered about 
fifteen more birds than his master, always a most 
generous neighbour, had claimed ; and though he 
must have narrowly escaped an apoplectic fit, he and 
his dogs continued to work equally hard all day. 

In laying out your lines of butts, bear in mind 
that there is no invariable necessity for your driving 
line to progress from a given base in a direct line to 
the centre of the butts. It frequently occurs that on 
a particular range of moor the birds will always fly in 
a great curve, or a complete ring, eventually getting 
back in this manner to the ground they were flushed 
upon. In this case you must also drive on a curve, 
and the first half of the beat may have to be driven 
by advancing almost at right angles to the direction 
desired, or, so to speak, across the face of the row of 
butts. As in this diagram, for instance, you may wish 
to drive your birds, mostly lying about A, to some- 
where about the point D. 

But for reasons connected with the nature of the 
ground, they will not fly from A to D direct, but in- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 



213 



variably fly from A in the curves indicated, alighting 
mostly at the points x x. Now, make your formation 
as shown here, follow their curve to the point x with 

C 

f P P 




FIG. 7. 



214 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



the main body of your men, and on flushing them 
again at the points x x you will find they fly on to 
one or other of the points about D, where I have in- 
dicated lines of butts. 

To arrive at these things you must either be on 
the moor as constantly as a keeper or a shepherd, or 
have out a few men and make experimental drives, 
letting your head man lie on a high point, whence he 
can command a view of the whole manoeuvre. 

The endless varieties and possibilities of managing 
grouse according to conditions of ground, wind, and 
season, will afford you many interesting and pleasant 
days between the intervals of your shooting parties, 
while they will add immensely to your enjoyment of 
the results. 

For actual marksmanship I must refer my readers 
to what I have endeavoured to make clear in the 
volume on ' Partridge ' of this series, and to the dia- 
grams explaining the reasons for shooting over birds, 
&c., repeating once more that it is impossible to teach 
anyone how to shoot driven birds. With driven grouse 
the necessity for shooting high is even more marked 
than with partridges. You will get many more shots 
on the level and below you, and in aiming at these you 
must constantly bear in mind to avoid the tendency 
to dwell or poke at the birds. This always results 



ENGLISH DRIVING 215 

more or less in your dropping the muzzle of the gun 
and shooting underneath. You will often- see very 
bad practice made at grouse flying very low, creeping 
as it were over the heather, and perhaps going slowly 
against the wind. Here all the missing takes place 
from shooting under them. The only way to avoid it 
is to form the habit of firing the instant the gun is firm 
on the shoulder, and of striking your aim high, almost 
as though you would shoot just over the bird's back. 

Many people think they miss these birds from 
shooting in front of them. I fancy this is rarely 
the case, but at any rate the matter can be easily 
tested by firing one or two shots straight at them, and 
watching the result. You will find that you kill low- 
flying birds more easily when they are above you than 
below, a fact which sufficiently proves that in aiming 
at the latter it is the depression of the muzzle which 
accounts for the missing. Keep the left arm well 
forward, and lift it well, relying upon this member 
entirely for the swing and support of your piece. 
You have less to guide your eye in the way of station- 
ary objects, such as trees, &c., in grouse driving, and 
therefore you must make up your mind to rely more 
than ever on calculation as to where to aim. The 
principle, which I have before advocated, of rapidly 
deciding in your mind where the spot is in the air at 



216 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

which your shot will intercept the bird's flight, and 
throwing your gun directly and quickly upon it, is 
the only one by which you can compete with the 
endless variety of angle, curve, elevation and pace, 
which lends to the flight of driven grouse its un- 
doubted fascination. There can be no 'knack' in 
excelling at a sport which presents this feature in the 
highest degree of all. The individual driven grouse 
which comes straight at your nose on a still day is 
easy enough, but these are the ' half-volleys ' of grouse 
driving, and to hit them does not necessarily make 
you a good bat. It is a very different matter to realise 
the proper total from a succession of fine drives under 
varying conditions of light, locality and wind ; and 
when the day comes that you have achieved this, in 
first-rate form from start to finish, you will sleep like 
a public-school boy who has made 100 at Lord's, or 
a Prime Minister who has carried a great measure 
through the Commons by a triumphant majority, per- 
haps the two most enviable achievements known in 
this country.

CHAPTER V 

GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 

IT is beginning to be generally understood that a 
moor, whether English or Scotch, will not produce the 
stock of grouse demanded by modern ideas, or to 
satisfy appetites whetted by the experience of excep- 
tional seasons and results, without due attention to the 
management of the ground, and to the nourishment of 
a healthy stock of birds. The old system of treat- 
ing grouse entirely as fera nature, and trusting 
them and the ground on which they breed to 
the development of nature, may leave you always a 
sprinkling of birds, but will not give you the stock you 
have a right to expect after paying the high value 
which such shooting now commands, nor satisfy the 
requirements of your friends. Further, it is found 
that however large the supply, the demand for these, 
the best of all game birds for the table, increases pro- 
portionately, and that it is possible to throw away 
a great deal of good money and food supply by 



218 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

allowing incompetence or want of care to decrease the 
productive powers of good moorland. 

Again, as this demand increases and the subject is 
more and more widely ventilated, the ingenuity of the 
poacher, the pothunter, and the receiver of poached or 
illegally killed game becomes annually more formid- 
able. The only saving clause is that the red grouse 
being universally known to be exclusively indigenous 
to the British Islands, we do not see the poulterer's 
shops in March, April, or May full of ' Siberian ' or 
' Norwegian ' grouse stolen from British moors, as we 
undoubtedly should if the species were found in those 
foreign countries. I must refer my readers to my 
remarks in the volume on ' The Partridge ' as to the 
illegally procured birds which come into the London 
markets on August 12 and September i, and to 
the suggestions I there made, which I now wish to 
urge again. Owners and lessees of shootings seem 
for the most part not to have realised the extent of 
the illicit traffic in game, which applies to grouse 
almost more than any other kind ; and I venture again 
to express the hope that some one with more leisure 
and more influence than I have may found some Asso- 
ciation to combat this evil in a businesslike manner. 
Those who are in London on August 1 2 may be quite 
certain that any grouse that is offered to them, 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 219 



unless sent direct by a friend from his own moor, is 
a poached, practically a stolen, bird. I remember 
being served with one which was absolutely putrid on 
the Twelfth, some years ago, at a well-known London 
restaurant. An old friend, the late Lord Dupplin, 
was dining near me, and had an equally bad one 
served to him. We agreed to send them both away 
in fact, though the price was 14*. per bird, they 
were uneatable but the head waiter explained (?) 
to us that this was the true flavour of the grouse, and 
that we were ignorant. Poor Duppy ! I can see his 
face of mingled disgust and amusement now at the 
idea of a crapulous Swiss waiter explaining to him and 
me what a grouse ought to taste like. 

But since the price that can be obtained for these 
birds on the Twelfth will always be a temptation to 
the evilly disposed, it behoves owners to look closely 
after what happens in the moorland districts in the 
week preceding that day. They cannot always be on 
the spot at that time, but if an association or league, 
such as I suggested in the former volume, were 
formed, trained detectives could easily watch the 
consignments passing through certain centres from 
t the moorland, and trace their origin and destination. 
It has even come to this, that, as I am informed, silk 
and other nets are actually provided by London 



220 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



poulterers, and are supplied to their fellow-culprits 
in this traffic, if not to the poachers direct ; and no 
questions are asked as long as they get the supply of 
grouse for sale on the Twelfth. This is a disgraceful 
state of things ; and it should be remembered that, 
without troubling Parliament with further legislation 
(which, unhappily, in these days is beset with diffi- 
culties of all kinds), there is ample law to put a stop 
to these practices if only trouble is taken to run the 
offenders to ground. 

It would be impossible to prevent the sale itself 
of grouse at a distance from the moors, say in London 
or elsewhere, but at least those who are fond of sport 
may do something to check the demand. I would, 
therefore, beg all good sportsmen who may be far 
from the moors on the Twelfth to restrain their appe- 
tite for grouse, and refuse to purchase any for a day 
or two at least. If this were universally done in 
restaurants and clubs, it would go far towards check- 
ing the evil, and those to whom I appeal would be 
spared the indignation or gastronomic disappoint- 
ment which they will probably experience on being 
offered a grouse of a week old which purports to have 
been killed that morning. 

Grouse are poached in many ways, and one of the 
most destructive is the recently introduced practice 



GROUND, STOCK', AND POACHING 221 



of surrounding a moor with nets, which catch the 
birds as they fly off it on to the neighbouring pas- 
tures. This has been carried to such a pitch in some 
parts of Yorkshire, Westmoreland, and the other 
northern counties, that the value of a moor becomes 
seriously affected by it. A sort of blackmail is set 
up, which obliges anyone taking the moor either to 
hire all the adjoining pasture land as well, or to enter 
into an agreement with certain parties not to net in 
this manner for either of which forms of protection 
he is mulcted in proportion to the value of the net- 
ting on such ground, often amounting to nearly as 
large a number of birds as he will get on the moor 
proper by fair shooting. On one Yorkshire moor 
that I know this lately became so serious, and the 
stock was getting so much reduced, that the owner 
purchased netting himself, which he set on the moor 
edges in charge of his own men, so as to intercept 
the birds before they reached the enemy's nets, those 
taken being merely set at liberty again. Miles of 
this netting these poachers have in some places, so 
that the protecting nets of the owner and the con- 
stant watching become a serious consideration. 

It is difficult to see how this can be prevented by 
the operation of law, since where it is done on any 
scale the net owners are careful to take out a game 



SHOOTING 'THE GROUSE 



licence, and to keep strictly to their own ground. 
But a great deal of netting is done illegally on other 
people's ground, both by night and day pure poach- 
ing, in fact and has become a very common and 
lucrative business. This is due almost entirely to the 
supineness or ignorance of the owners of moors, who 
for the most part are not in the locality at the time 
when it is done, and who seem to me much too ready 
to accept the invariable excuse of ' disease ' or ' cold 
breeding season ' for the low stock of birds on the 
ground. 

As with partridges and other game, I have always 
observed that where there are really first-rate and 
honest keepers, there is always a pretty good stock of 
grouse. Of course seasons will vary, and anyone 
used to the moors will know pretty well when to make 
the allowance for bad weather, &c. ; but it is astonish- 
ing how lightly moors suffer from this cause or from 
disease when the keeper and his subordinates are 
thoroughly trustworthy. The only remedy you have as 
an owner is to pay strictly -bj results. The details 
must be left to your administrator, the keeper. So 
long as you have a good show of birds, allowing for 
variation of seasons, your ground is well burnt, and 
all the other details well looked after, keep and reward 
him as much as you can. But if the totals begin to fall 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 223 



gradually year by year, the heather remains long and 
old, the driving slack and listless, and you are puzzled 
to account for the deterioration of your moor, change 
your whole staff of keepers, tell your new ones that 
you expect certain results and mean to have them, 
and in a year or two you will probably be astonished 
to find how the grouse have taken to your ground 
again. 

On high moors you are liable to lose a great many 
birds by their leaving the ground for lower ranges in 
severe weather. It is quite worth while to feed them 
a little at such times. It is chiefly when the snow is 
caked or frozen over with a very thin coating of ice, 
and they cannot scratch through it to get food, that 
they are most pinched and may leave the ground, 
never to come back. I remember Mr. Walter Stan- 
hope l telling me that in the very hard winter of 
1859-60 the grouse on his Dunford Bridge moors 
left the ground in hundreds ; many were killed in the 
fields in a half-starved state, and even one or two in 
the barrack square at Sheffield, some fifteen miles off. 
He then sent men up to the moor with long rakes, and 

1 Mr. Walter Spencer Stanhope, who for many years re- 
presented one of the divisions of the West Riding in Parliament. 
An admirable letter from his pen is given in the Badminton 
Library, Shooting, vol. ii. p. II, describing some of the earliest 
methods and results of driving grouse. 



224 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



as they raked the snow off the grouse followed them 
close, as gulls will follow the plough, or chickens the 
good-wife in the poultry yard, perfectly tame. 

Your keepers should see to these methods of help- 
ing them to feed in severe weather, and not, as is too 
often the case, helplessly gape at the half-starved 
packs sitting on walls or scratching at the ground in 
the fields below the moorland, until, forced by hunger, 
they rise and fly clean away in search of milder 
conditions. 

The same authority (Mr. Stanhope) always ex- 
pressed himself in favour of plantations round and 
about the edges of the moors. Though they may 
attain no value as timber, they will prove a great pro- 
tection to the grouse in a heavy snow. Then they will 
be able to creep under the boughs of the stunted 
larches or spruces, scratching and picking a bit when 
they cannot get at food or shelter on the open moor. 
Grouse, I believe, very rarely die of cold, excepting the 
devoted hens, which sometimes allow themselves to 
be frozen, or so pinched by the cold while sitting on 
their nests that they succumb within a short time. But 
they suffer severely from starvation in hard winters, 
and although their moving off the ground in large 
packs in search of food may, as Mr. Rimington Wilson 
has observed, serve to mingle the blood and improve 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 12$ 

the breeding stock on the ground they move to, it will 
hardly benefit you on the deserted high ground, as 
few of them, if any, are likely to return. Grouse 
travel much longer distances than is generally sup- 
posed, and I am firmly convinced that many a Scotch 
bird has been killed well on this side of the border. 
Lord Huntingfield is said to have seen a pack of 
grouse flying over his place in Norfolk. I have not 
his lordship's word for it, but have often heard it from 
friends of his, and certainly his authority would be 
indisputable, after the many hundreds his unerring 
aim has accounted for. 1 

Mr. Rimington Wilson, in an admirable letter to 
the ' Field ' of September 10, 1892, gives four principal 
points to be attended to in the management of a 
moor : 

1. Heather burning. 

2. Driving v. shooting in other ways. 

3. Keeping down vermin. 

4. Sheep, c. 

To these I would add : 

5. Watchful protection against poachers. 

6. Feeding &c. in hard weather. 

1 I have only shot one week with Lord Huntingfield. His 
accuracy was marvellous, while never appearing to take a long 
shot. It was a very pretty lesson, and one which I am proud 
to have learnt. 



226 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



7. Planting round and upon lower parts of your 
moor. 

As regards burning, it is instructive to find Mr. 
Wilson, Lord Walsingham, and the Mackintosh (see 
p. 156) all agreed as to the necessity of this system 
in order to keep the heather in a healthy condition. 
Mr. Wilson believes in burning altogether any large 
tract of deep old heather, though as a general rule 
the moor should be burnt in strips. Where possible 
these should run parallel with your lines of butts. 
He remarks also on the splendid stretches of young 
heather following on an accidental fire. I have 
noticed the same myself, and fully agree with him 
that most moors are not severely enough burned. 
The old heather is always damp underneath, affords 
no healthy food for grouse or sheep, and is abominable 
to walk through. Artistically speaking, I regret that 
I must give my verdict in favour of systematic burn- 
ing, while, practically, I must own that it is absolutely 
essential for the healthy condition of the grouse. On 
a moor that is exclusively ' dogged ' it must be burnt 
in patches, so that the young birds, feeding on the 
very young shoots, may have close to them the resort 
of good cover in an older patch, and avoid being 
driven off their feed by the older birds, and that they 
may thus be more evenly distributed over the ground. 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 227 

On driving v. shooting over dogs I have already 
delivered myself in other chapters of this volume, 
but must again quote Mr. Wilson : ' It is, perhaps, 
superfluous to remark that to make a moor as pro- 
ductive as possible shooting over dogs ought to 
be allowed to a very limited extent, if at all. The 
candle should not be burnt at both ends' 

A certain number of sheep will do no harm upon a 
moor, but too many will do a great deal; while cattle 
and horses will always cause the heather to deteriorate, 
and a coarse, rank kind of grass to spring up, which 
is not good for pasture and useless for grouse. Here, 
again, liberality and a kindly feeling to the shepherds 
will do more for your stock than anything. They 
have it in their hands to injure if not to cripple your 
sport altogether. Their dogs can destroy in an hour 
in the breeding season what would give you a good 
day's driving later on. But I have always found them 
a kindly and simple race of people, and if well treated 
they will see that their flocks do not trample on the 
nests or young birds, and that their dogs do not 
career wildly over the moor during the nesting period. 
They are really your best and most loyal grouse- 
keepers if you enlist them on your side; and besides 
so ordering their work on the hills as not to injure 
the grouse, they can render immense assistance to 

(1 2 



228 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

your keepers in the tracking of vermin, detection of 
poaching, and other such matters, besides sometimes 
lending willing and skilful aid to the management 
of your drives. Moral : above all things be kind 
and liberal to the shepherds and farmers. 

Mr. Wilson omits to mention protection against 
poaching, though his moors lie in a country where it 
is well understood ; but I think I can account for 
this. I said above that good keepers always have a 
good show of game ; and certainly his head man, Ward, 
is an excellent example of this. A past master in 
the art of driving, his is also a name of terror to 
poachers, and in the security which so loyal a servant 
inspires, Mr. Wilson may well have forgotten how 
little his boundaries might be respected were they 
under less formidable protection. 

In addition to feeding the birds and raking off 
the frozen snow in winter, I would endorse what the 
Mackintosh says as to the improvement of the water 
supply by puddling up the streams, and making many 
little reservoirs, so as to insure the birds plenty to 
drink in a very dry breeding season, such as we ex- 
perienced last year (1893). 

Vermin must be thoroughly kept down, and on 
Scotch moors, terminating as they mostly do in high 
rocky ground, it is no easy work to keep in check the 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 229 

depredations of foxes, crows, jackdaws, eagles, ravens, 
stoats, weasels, hawks of all kinds, and even occasion- 
ally wild cats, or cats which have become wild and 
taken to the rocks and ravines. I would never kill 
an eagle, but rather keep so grand a bird on the best 
my moor provided, nor would I, personally, shoot a 
peregrine; but the other species I have named, besides 
being less picturesque, are less rare, and must be 
' attended to.' The anti-game-law party in Scotland 
lately started the cry that the destruction of hawks, 
owls &c. had subjected them to a plague of field 
voles (the common little brown mouse so often seen 
on the hills), and that these creatures were devouring 
their pastures, and impoverishing their stock ; but a 
perusal of the evidence before the Royal Commission 
on this subject will, I think, convince any reasonable 
person that the appearance of these animals in large 
numbers in particular localities has been of spasmodic 
recurrence from time immemorial, and that when 
they appear hawks and owls usually appear also in 
increased numbers to keep them in check. They seem 
to leave certain districts, or die off, as erratically and 
as rapidly as they appear, and the agitators failed 
altogether to connect their appearance with the de- 
struction of vermin by gamekeepers. 

Poaching, dishonesty, and disloyalty, encouraged 



230 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



as they are by the unscrupulousness of the receivers 
of stolen and illegally killed game in the large towns, 
are after all the things most to be guarded against, and 
I have endeavoured to indicate how I think they may 
best be combated. I have before me a working model 
of the nets used in Yorkshire, with poles, clips &c. 
complete, as well as a fair selection of specimens of 
snares ; but I think that the accurate description of 
how all such engines should be used is against the 
interests of sport, and may serve only to encourage 
poaching by diffusing the science of how to do it. 
Wherever there is good moorland, well watered and 
with plenty of sheltered places, there ought to be a 
good stock of grouse. Laziness is much more 
common among hill keepers than where population 
is more dense, while the climate of Scotch glens, 
especially on the west coast, tends to enervate men. 
The great antidote for this is to be constantly on the 
high ground in the fresher air, as you will discover for 
yourself during a long stay in Scotland. Your head 
man should, therefore, see that his assistants are con- 
stantly on the moor looking after the welfare of the 
birds ; instead of giving way, as they often do, to the 
temptation of merely gazing at it from below all day, 
and leaving it to take care of itself all night. 

The great and mysterious plague known as the 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 231 

grouse disease is the most powerful enemy to be 
fought against. I cannot agree that it is due to 
overcrowding and here again I turn to the Mackin- 
tosh and Mr. Rimington Wilson for corroboration. 
Mr. Wilson writes me : ' Since about 1870 there has 
been no disease on these moors sufficiently severe to 
prevent shooting ; previous to this date disease seems 
to have recurred severely and regularly about every 
seven years. There is no doubt that driving has pro- 
duced this healthier state of affairs.' The Mackintosh 
writes : ' On the Moy Hall moor there has been 
practically no disease since 1873. Driving was first 
resorted to in 1869, and only then when birds were 
too wild to sit to dogs ; ' but he adds that it was not 
seriously taken up until 1872. 

In considering these two statements we must bear 
in mind that the former is an undoubted authority on 
Yorkshire driving of over twenty years' standing, on 
whose moors all the English records have been 
eclipsed ; and that the latter is the most successful 
exponent of the adoption of the system in Scotland, 
and holds the record for the latter country. I might 
add that to my certain knowledge, where good 
management prevails, many other moors have yielded 
a fair proportion of birds even in the years when 
disease has been reported severe and prevalent over 



232 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



both Scotland and England. What are we to think of 
those moors, which have been let to a variety of 
tenants for twenty years, and where nothing but the 
old-fashioned system of exclusive 'dogging' in the 
early part of the season has ever been practised, which 
are almost annually reported as having suffered 
severely from disease, and have produced gradually 
declining results ? Is it too much to agree with autho- 
rities such as I have quoted, and to come to the con- 
clusion that other causes besides disease have been at 
work on these unfortunate moors ? I think not ; and 
it will take a great deal to convince me that good 
grouse ground can deteriorate to this extent for no 
visible cause except the eternal cry of ' disease.' The 
birds on ill-preserved ground are never good spe- 
cimens of the race. A deer-forest grouse is not, 
as a rule, to be compared, for weight, plumage, 
or flavour to one from Studley or Wemmergill. If 
the Scotch keeper on such ground does not learn by 
more direct channels, he will eventually discover by 
the depreciated value of the moor which he manages 
that he or his predecessors have killed the grouse with 
the golden eggs. A pound a brace or even more has 
been, and is still, paid by the unwary who rent certain 
Scotch shootings ; but a Yorkshire moor which yields 
3,000 brace, though very scarce in the market, will 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 233 



not fetch 3,ooo/. for the season. Those who take the 
average shooting, and wish for a moderate amount of 
sport at a moderate expense, should look more closely 
than they do into the records of the moor, should 
submit to no clauses in their lease which oblige them 
to keep on any particular keeper or nominee of the 
landlord, and should study more closely the methods 
which have been adopted on the moors where a really 
successful result is shown. 

The exact nature of the grouse disease is very 
difficult to determine. Lord Walsingham, some years 
since, offered a considerable money prize for the best 
essay on the subject ; but the result was unsatisfactory, 
and no one, if I recollect rightly, offered a solution 
worthy to receive the reward. Dr. Cobbold's pam- 
phlet still remains as the only scientific effort offering 
a tangible solution of the question. He ascribes it 
all to the Strongylus pergracilis^ a little thread-like 
worm which breeds in the throat, and eventually in 
thousands in all the organs of the bird. It is further 
alleged that ponies and sheep had died on the moors 
during years when disease was prevalent from the 
attacks of the same parasite. But not even Dr. Cob- 
bold can tell us whence or how the Strongylus per- 
gracilis is produced, or whether it is the cause or 
effect of weakness in the larger body. I remember, 



234 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



in 1874 or thereabouts, on the late Sir Charles 
Forbes's moors at Dalradample, in Aberdeenshire, 
we were all taking refuge on a wet stormy day in one 
of the butts for luncheon. I sat on a seat in the 
corner, made of sods cut from the moor, and when I 
rose, found on my mackintosh and on the sod under 
me a quantity of small thread-like worms, answering 
exactly to Dr. Cobbold's description of the Strongylus. 
On examination, I found many others under where 
others of the party were lying or sitting, as though 
the warmth of their bodies had drawn these creatures 
to the surface. The particular growth they were in 
was not heather, but the coarse grass, reddish at the 
tips, so common on the moors and rough hill pas- 
tures. I put several of them carefully into a bottle 
with bits of the grass, intending to send them to 
Lord Walsingham, as one of our first entomologists, 
for examination ; but, alas ! by next morning they 
were all dried up and almost invisible dead, and 
shrivelled to nothing. 

This seemed to show that they were produced, 
supposing them to be identical with Cobbold's para- 
site, on certain ground, and prevalent, like the field 
voles, at spasmodic intervals. I was much disappointed 
at my failure to get a scientific opinion, but commend 
this experience to those who would pursue the subject 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 235 



seriously. I should add that the ground was very 
damp, and that the weather had been very wet for 
some weeks previously. 

I believe that no remedy has ever been hit on 
or tried with any satisfactory result. Rock salt has 
been suggested ; but this does not appear to commend 
itself to the grouse. I have always thought that if it 
were practicable and not too expensive the heather 
might, as an experiment, be sown with salt, in case the 
parasite is really generated first upon the ground. I 
am sure that very little would suffice to kill worms such 
as I found on the occasion mentioned, and it might ' 
prove beneficial as against tapeworms in their young or 
embryo condition. So far as we know at present, we 
can only fight against the disease, or ward it off, by the 
common-sense practice of regular heather burning, and 
maintaining a vigorous race of birds by the methods 
and management I have mentioned above, aided by 
such suggestions as those who have long and practical 
experience of moois and moor-game can furnish in 
addition. 

I have alluded above to accidental fires. These 
may do no harm, possibly some eventual good, when 
the ground is somewhat damp and the weather broken, 
as in spring ; but in very hot dry weather in the 
summer they may prove very serious. At such times 



236 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



take every precaution against casual fires being lighted, 
and request your guests to be careful with matches, 
and also to watch that sparks from the gun do not 
start a conflagration. I set my butt on fire three 
times in one day at Studley, and only extinguished it 
with considerable difficulty. 

On these very moors, in 1872, the most disastrous 
moorland fire ever known took place. The fire de- 
stroyed 1,300 acres of the best of the ground, going 
eight or ten feet deep into the peat, and the smoke of 
it was perceptible for thirty or forty miles. I have 
not been on this ground lately, but can vouch for the 
fact that, ten years after the fire, the vast expanse of 
the ' burnt ground ' on Studley moor remained black 
and barren, a warning of what the careless lighting of 
a match may do in hot weather.

CHAPTER VI 

' THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR ' 

MR. JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS has in his delightful 
book, ' Game Birds and Shooting Sketches,' given a 
description of bird and animal life in the early morn- 
ing on the lower edges of the moorland, and this, 
with many other passages in the work, I commend to 
those who love the poetry of nature. A son of the 
great painter whose tender and masterly touch alone 
seems able to grasp the realities and idealities, the 
romances or complexities, which go to make up the life 
of this age, he develops, as one of the first naturalists 
of to-day, a convincing admiration for nature and a 
brilliant power of drawing birds inheritances of his 
father's talents. 

From Sir John, my earliest master in outdoor 
painting, 1 I am not ashamed to have stolen the title 
of this chapter, in order to describe the picturesque 

1 I believe I may claim the honour of being the only pupil 
Sir J. Millais ever had alas ! for too short a time. 



238 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



and varied ground which, lying next to or forming 
part of the moorland proper, leads you by the plea- 
santest of transitions to the cultivated land. This is 
the Bohemia of shooting the tract where we have 
all spent some of the pleasantest of our days in cir- 
cumventing its distinctive denizens, or in making a 
mixed bag without the aid of the organisation of a 
regular shooting party. Here sits the capercailzie 
and lurks the roe ; here abides the blackcock and 
crouches the hare ; here stalks the pheasant and 
sleeps the woodcock ; while from above and below 
the grouse and the partridge meet on the heathery 
slopes and rushy bottoms of this debatable land, the 
fringe of the moor. 

Driving the woods for black-game and anything 
else that may be in them provides the pleasantest of 
shooting days, liberally tinged with the element of 
surprise, which is as essentially an integral part of 
sport as it is admitted to be of wit. I quite agree 
with the late Mr. Bromley-Davenport, than whom no 
better sportsman ever rode, shot, or fished, that it is 
hateful to know exactly how much game there is in a 
covert, how many birds in a turnip field. All interest 
is gone the moment the element of uncertainty or 
surprise is removed. The great charm of the moor 
edge is its variety. The long .plantation of larch or 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 239 



fir, standing ankle-deep in yellow grass or breast-high 
in bracken, breaks imperceptibly into a bed of heather, 
dotted with young trees, which in turn gives way to 
swampy hollows or rushy wastes, not infrequently 
bordering a field or two of stubble or turnips before 
the wood or moor begins again. Small coverts, great 
open brakes of fern, and deep ravines where the 
heather can scarce cling to the steep sides between 
the rocks, succeed each other in delightful confusion, 
the whole forming an agglomeration of various sorts 
of covert, which used to be called by the old keeper 
at Drumlanrig ' by the expressive term of ' what- 
nots.' 

Many charming days have I enjoyed in years 
gone by among those ' what-nots,' where sometimes 
twelve or thirteen varieties of game, from the fallow 
deer to the jack-snipe, were killed in one day, and 
great were the numbers of the black-game. The two 
distinct kinds of black-game driving are determined 
by the nature of the ground. In the one your com- 
pany of well-organised drivers sweeps a succession of 
so-called pastures, though the herbage on Jhem is 
not of the best, differing but little, except for the 

1 Dnimlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire, the principal seat of 
the Duke of Buccleuch, which stands on an estate of 175,000 
acres. 



240 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

frequently intersecting stone walls and marked in- 
closures, from the moor itself. In the other, some- 
times with an imposing but casual array of beaters, 
suggesting somewhat the levies of a pretender or 
an outlaw, but more often with the unaided skill 
of a half-dozen of keepers and gillies, the woods are 
ranged towards you as you stand in carefully selected 
spots, 'passes' where the blackcocks are sure to 
cross, and where you are equally on the look-out for 
a woodcock or a roebuck. 

The former style of black-game driving has been 
undoubtedly carried to the greatest perfection, and 
with the best results, on the Duke of Buccleuch's 
Dumfriesshire estates. Here, at Sanquhar or Wan- 
lock Head, lie the great stretches of rough pasture 
part grass, part rushes, part heather which favour a 
great stock of these birds, and which, lying between 
the oat stubbles and the luxuriant heather, afford 
them the variety of food that this specie seem in 
particular to affect. Here, ensconced behind a high 
wall, after, perhaps, removing the topmost course 
of stones to clear your view in front, having reached 
your places in strictly enforced silence, and weighed 
the consequences of any mistake, such as killing a 
greyhen,, or showing yourself unduly, which may ex- 
pose you to a fire of time-honoured chaff, you may 



'THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR* 241 

see a pack of a hundred or more blackcocks coming 
straight at your face, and on about the same level 
a sight never to be forgotten, and one that makes 
your heart beat faster and your hand tremble lest you 
bring ridicule upon yourself by missing these great 
ponderous objects as they come by you so close that 
you could almost touch them. The missing is easier 
than you would think, and we all know who have 
tried it how simple it is to shoot behind a black- 
cock, looking as big as a turkey, and seeming to 
be going very slow, within fifteen or twenty yards. 
Nothing will avail you but absolute confidence in 
your own shooting powers and a complete disregard 
of the disturbing personality of the quarry. You 
must shoot as at a driven partridge, if anything a 
shade more forward, and with more rather than less 
accuracy. With these precautions you will strike the 
bird in the head and neck, and he will collapse as 
easily as the aforesaid partridge. Without them, or 
if you should vainly try to kill two or three at a shot, 
you will inevitably miss altogether, or see your bird 
flinch and disappear, as you think, ' cut to ribbons.' 
This means that he will fly half a mile, rise again 
about fifty yards in front of your dog, and gaily fly 
on, never to be seen again ; or wheel round and re- 
turn contemptuously over your head, at the height 

R 



242 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



of the cross on St. Paul's Cathedral, to the ground 
whence he was first disturbed. 

Black-game have wonderful turning power, and it 
is a sight to see them, when they are driven down a 
heavy wind and suspect or are sure of danger in front, 
wheel deliberately round and go up wind over the 
drivers in the teeth of half a gale. For this reason it is 
necessary to observe silence as you move to your post 
and after you have reached it ; even smoking being 
in some places prohibited. The great thing is to get 
.the main body, the large pack or packs over the guns, 
scatter them to a certain extent, and at any rate utilise 
them for the next drive. 

To insure this you must also be careful not to 
show yourself, bearing in mind that they are quite 
capable of turning completely round and going back 
when within a few yards of you, and that when they 
have accomplished this you have done with that 
particular lot for the day. 

The first bird or two that comes by you should 
spare ; they will probably be greyhens, flushed by the 
drivers at the start ; but do not despise this warning, 
as should they come against a bright sky, or should you 
be unduly keen, you may find that you have incurred 
the penalty of error. I suppose that no one who 
has shot black-game has not made this mistake 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 243 



more than once ; therefore, I advise you, always let 
the first bird or two pass you before firing, as after 
they get level with you it is easy to distinguish the 
cock from the hen. Should you know that there is a 
large lot of cocks between the guns and the drivers, 
the first odd birds, whether cocks or hens, should 
always be allowed to pass without a shot being fired, so 
that the main body may come on without suspicion of 
danger. 

This applies when driving woods, but is seldom 
likely to be rigorously followed, as you will then be 
probably anxious to secure the mixed bag which 
the coverts afford. But in driving on the open moor 
or pastures it is absolutely essential, if you are going 
for a bag of blackcocks exclusively, to follow these 
tactics. 

In grouse driving, especially on broken ground, I 
am in favour of the beaters making some noise, for 
birds seated in hollows or anywhere out of sight of the 
flags, having heard the guns ahead and not being con- 
scious of the presence of the drivers, may rise and 
turn back. But for black-game driving I recommend 
absolute silence, as if too much scared they will 
get high up and leave the ground you are working, 
often crossing a broad deep valley and alighting on 
a far-off hill, clean off your day's ground. For black - 

R 2 



244 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



game driving no flags are necessary, or at the most 
one or two for men posted on the flank to prevent the 
birds taking some particular line away from the drive. 

Driving them from the woods is almost entirely a 
question of judicious placing of the guns ; the keeper 
should know the points or ' passes ' where they 
almost invariably break from a particular covert, and 
here the guns should be placed pretty close together. 
As this conduces to talking, silence must again be 
urged in waiting for these birds, the fact that they 
drive best up wind furnishing an additional reason for 
the exercise of caution and self-control. 

Walking the woods and broken ground in line in 
late September or early October is a very pretty form 
of sport, though the line is very difficult to keep in 
proper formation. Here you get very unexpected and 
difficult shots, a blackcock rising with a great rattle 
out of a little ravine being a customer whom it requires 
some skill to stop. At this time of year the cocks are 
found singly, scattered about the woods, seeking the 
various berries and grasses which they like as a change 
from heather, and some of them will lie very close. 
But they are then mostly young cocks ; so that for the 
good of your breeding stock it is better not to pursue 
them too closely in this fashion. The same remark 
applies even more strongly to attacking the young 



'THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR^ 245 

broods during the last days of August. At this time the 
cockney sportsman, having noted in the almanac that on 
August 20 ' Black-game shooting begins,' sallies forth, 
and decimates the immature pullets, none of which 
will fly far, while nearly all could be caught by the 
hand in the thick heather after the dog has ascertained 
their whereabouts. The old cock he probably never 
sees, or if he does he misses him, and the old hen 
most likely escapes also. Having done as much 
harm as it is possible to do in the day, he will return 
and indite an account of his prowess to the ' Field ; ' 
quaintly remarking that he ' had 18^ brace of black- 
game ' on the 2oth. Since he clearly need not have 
shot the majority of them, and should be ashamed of 
himself if he did, the fact that he possessed them is 
perhaps all that need be recorded. But it may be 
added that a young blackcock whom you happen upon 
' in the way of business ' is, if you let him get far 
enough before putting shot into him, one of the most 
delicious of all birds for the table. 

Stalking black-game, whether on the stocks of corn, 
or later on the open moor and pastures, is a very 
agreeable art, and one which will try your skill and 
sportsmanlike qualities to the utmost. Foul weather, 
when it is hardly fit to be out, is the best for this. 
You will then find the old cocks, which should always 



246 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



be the object of your pursuit, sitting on walls or 
mounds, and other bare dry places. The wind must 
be very carefully considered, and the stalk conducted 
with as much care as if you were after deer. If you 
alarm other birds or beasts, the blackcocks, like deer, 
will take alarm also, and though their sense of smell 
is not so keen as, their eyesight is undoubtedly superior 
to, that of the nobler animal. It is often a good plan 
to employ your man, always granted that you can 
trust his discretion, to move about at a distance, and 
in a different direction, so as to distract their wary 
eyes while you creep upon them. As chances are 
few at this sport, and it is important to kill these old 
stagers, who live to an immense age, long after they 
have become utterly useless for stud purposes, I 
would advise you never to spare a sitting shot. 

Of capercailzie shooting there is not much to be 
said. It is no doubt a beautiful sight to see these 
magnificent birds sailing past you as you stand in a 
clearing of the wood, and a very satisfactory thing to 
bring them down stone dead, as you can do if you hit 
them well forward. But as their flight is not long, 
the drives are not exciting, and beautiful as the bird 
may be he is not fit to eat in any shape but soup. 
Whatever you may do, the capercailzie will leave 
your ground or remain on it as they list, selecting their 



'THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR* 247 

favourite trees for residence, and being found perched 
there with monotonous regularity. They do not seem 
to acquire in Scotland (the only part of the British 
Islands where they can be found) even the wildness 
of habit which makes the pursuit of them so exciting 
in Germany and Austria. But as they that is, the 
cocks only, for a hen is never shot are only pursued 
in the latter countries in the breeding season, and are, 
in fact, slain in the act of carolling forth the song of 
love, I confess to but little sympathy for the sport. 

But when you have to deal with one that is driven 
to you, be not deceived by his size or the com- 
paratively slow beat of his wings. He is going fully 
as fast as a blackcock or a grouse, and unless you 
hit him in the head you need not trouble to fire. I 
once missed five old cocks in one drive, none of them 
more than thirty-five yards off, from misjudging their 
pace, and probably also in some degree their distance 
from me. All that can be said about them has been 
admirably put by Mr. Millais in his book ' and by 
Lord Charles Kerr in the Badminton Library. 2 

Last, but not least, we must breathe the keen air 
and tread the summer snows of the high tops, while 
we attack the shy and graceful ptarmigan. 

1 Game Birds and Shooting Sketches, 
" Moor and Afarsh, p. 53. 



248 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



The glorious scenery which surrounds the haunts 
of these beautiful birds makes the pursuit of them 
especially fascinating. The splendid air and brilliant 
light, the panoramic view, the shifting cloud and mist, 
the dizzy height and wondrous silence these weird 
surroundings are so fine that we almost forget our 
wish to slay the creatures that inhabit them, and pro- 
bably few men have descended from the ptarmigan 
hill in the evening without a pang of regret at 
having carried their predatory instinct into these 
picturesque solitudes. 

At first you cannot see the birds against the stones, 
so closely do they resemble the pale grey rock, white 
spa, and speckled moss which form their background ; 
but presently they move and run before you, seeming 
quite tame, but fifteen yards away. In another second 
they are all in the air together, their white wings flash- 
ing in the sun, they have doubled in a bunch along 
the hill, and now, well separated from one another, are 
sailing away at a terrific pace, while you sorrowfully 
eject your empty and profitless cartridge cases. You 
must advance upon them with the gun held ready, 
almost up to the shoulder, and as they all turn toge- 
ther, the killing moment, try and knock over a brace 
cleverly, though the second bird will take you all you 
know to stop. 



'THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR* 249 

They always rise all together and close to one 
another, and many people, otherwise scrupulous 
sportsmen, will, as they turn, shoot into the brown, or 
rather the ' white,' of the covey. This I think horribly 
cruel and unfair, specially so in the case of ptarmigan, 
for a wounded bird who may fly across a valley 
which it would take you four hours of descent and 
ascent to cross, is more often than not never retrieved, 
but left to linger in a rift between the rocks, or fall a 
victim on the mossy slopes to the eagle, the raven, or 
the fox. 

In beating a round hill, it is a good plan to 
separate and work round it in two parties, when 
you will send some beautiful rocketing shots from one 
to the other ; but your guns must be accurate, careful 
shots, or as you approach to meet again you may 
easily shoot one another. The handling of the gun 
altogether demands experience and closer attention 
on ptarmigan ground than on any other. The footing 
is often bad, and slips over loose stones are frequent, 
while the possibility of blinding one of the party by 
a ricochet off the rocks must always be borne in mind. 
The best way to carry the gun on such ground, ivher- 
ever possible, is in the right hand only, thrown back, 
with the barrels resting on your right shoulder and the 
hand on the grip. Then, should you fall, your piece 



250 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

will fall forward as you extend your arm, and should a 
jar discharge it, will probably do no harm. But when 
there is anyone in front of you, it is obvious this 
method of carrying the gun becomes the most unsafe, 
and you must harden your heart and be prepared to 
lose here and there a chance by carrying it at half- 
cock carefully nursed over your left arm, while you 
are clinging to the steep face or picking your way 
among loose stones. 

Ptarmigan can be driven, .though to do it to a 
profitable extent there should be a great stock of them, 
and an elaborate organisation becomes necessary. The 
ground they inhabit is so steep that the drivers must 
usually be sent up by a different route from the guns, 
and unless the whole thing is very .carefully arranged 
the drive is likely to fail of its result. There are 
usually only a few broods on a particular hill, and I 
think, if you are not too hard upon them (for on certain 
days it is possible to kill almost every bird you see), 
it is a better and pleasanter way to walk the ground 
for them. Pointers or setters you will hardly require, 
though here and there, especially for finding a wounded 
bird, they will be useful. But the blue hares, which 
are usually pretty well sprinkled over the ptarmigan 
ground, are trying to your dogs, and you can be 
pretty sure of finding the birds without them. 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 251 



Ptarmigan, like all other birds, are much in- 
fluenced by the wind, and should your march run 
along the top of the hill it is useless to go out unless 
the wind favours their lying on your side ; otherwise 
every bird on the hill will be over the march, and 
though you may get a splendid walk, you will make 
but a poor bag of either birds or hares. 

Where possible, separate into two parties, so as to 
drive birds to one another, and in this way each party 
is likely to be of service to the other in retrieving 
wounded birds. The valleys, which they cross in a 
few seconds and with consummate ease, are almost a 
day's work for men to traverse ; and somehow the 
idea of leaving these beautiful birds to a lingering 
death in their own wild home is peculiarly repugnant 
to the feelings of a good sportsman. 

To revert to the lower ground, I think that 
where you have, in addition to grouse, a large stock 
of black-game, the interests of the farmers should be 
borne in mind. There is no doubt that when the 
corn is standing in stooks a large flock of these birds, 
visiting the fields every night and morning, will 
destroy a large amount of grain. You will find your- 
self all the more popular in the glen if you visit them 
on off days when keen on this food, and a beautiful 
afternoon's sport may be enjoyed by lying in wait for 



252 SHOOTING THEf+GROUSE 



them as they come from the moor to the corn-land. 
Black-game if disturbed once or twice on their feed 
will be chary of returning to the same place for a 
space of time, and the farmer will be found very 
grateful to you if, while enjoying a pleasant variety of 
sport, you show some anxiety to protect his produce 
from these voracious visitors. 

I regret to have to record my opinion that the 
decrease in the numbers of black-game in Scotland 
is due entirely to illegal destruction of these birds. 
They are easily poached, and since the poulterers 
have been suffered to expose them for sale during the 
spring and summer months as ' Norwegian,' the 
diminution in the general stock has become very 
marked. No one should buy or eat black-game from 
Christmas until the following August. Whether they 
come from Norway or not, they are not in season ; 
they must have been destroyed during the period 
when every animal but the lowest vermin should be 
let alone, and have never been come by in the honest 
ways of sport.

CHAPTER VII 

RECORDS AND REMARKS 

ALL the British shooting world now knows that 
a man can kill 500 brace of grouse to his own gun 
in one day given the accuracy, the physique, the 
endurance, and the grouse necessary since the feat 
has been performed by an Englishman on his own 
moor in Yorkshire. We also know that 1,000 brace 
and upwards to a party of well-selected shots is a 
performance we may always expect to hear of in 
a good grouse season, and that it has been done 
already several times in the same county. We 
further know that 500 brace can be killed in a day 
in Scotland, since it was done last year (1893) m 
Inverness-shire ; and in none of these cases are we 
sure that the limit of possibility has been reached. 

To defend large bags is always a difficult task, 
since they must generally appear unnatural and un- 
sportsmanlike to persons who have no experience 
of well- organised and accurate shooting on strictly 



254 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

preserved ground ; and, be it observed, it is only from 
such as these that the attack ever comes. Such 
experience and study as I have been able to bring to 
bear on the subject convinces me that the more 
grouse there are on the moors, the more partridges in 
the fields, and the more pheasants in the coverts, the 
better for everybody in this struggling age. We ought 
to rejoice in the discovery that by good manage- 
ment the food-producing power of the moors, no less 
than their opportunities for healthy pleasure and 
exercise, can be increased to such a pitch. If the 
grouse are there, it is clear they must be killed to be 
utilised as food, and surely no one would advocate their 
being destroyed by means of nets or other engines in 
the wholesale manner of the poacher or poulterer. It 
is evident the results, cannot be obtained by the old- 
fashioned methods, since where these have been 
abandoned the stock has so much increased that it 
would no longer be possible to deal with the birds 
except by organised driving. 

I have never been one of those who have cavilled 
at Lord Walsingham's unique performance. Records 
must and will continue to be broken by Englishmen 
until the limit is reached, and it seems to me far 
better that everyone should know the extraordi- 
nary value and fecundity of well-preserved moors.

WALSINGHAM. 

September 20, 1888. 



Although the result has been published, I do 
not think any previous work contains this account of 
the details. The small pick-up, 34 birds out of a 
total of 1,056 only about 3 per cent, testifies to clean 
killing and humane and careful gathering of wounded ; 
while the hours occupied and proportion of kills to 
misses are sufficient to show that to produce the 
performance a man must be a first-rate sportsman and 
athlete. 

Here is the account of two days at Mr. Rimington 
Wilson's, on the Broomhead moors near Sheffield, last 
year (1893). The first constitutes the record bag for 
one day's grouse shooting :

1,910 grouse picked up by luncheon on the 3Oth. 



XECOKDS AND REMARKS 



=57 



Mr. Wilson also held the record previous to this 
day viz. 2,626 grouse, killed at Broomhead on 
September 6, 1872, by thirteen guns, including the 
late Mr. J. W. Rimington Wilson, one of the finest 
shots and most accomplished men of his time, and his 
two sons, who took outside places all day. The most 
recent record, as given above, to nine guns, is of course 
by far the more remarkable of the two. 

Here, again, are some of the results of the well- 
known Wemmergill moor, kindly furnished me by 
Lord Westbury, who has rented it almost ever since 
Sir Frederick Milbank gave it up. He says : ' For 
the last seven years this moor, which is under 12,000 
acres, has yielded an average of over 6,000 birds a 
year ; this period includes two very bad seasons viz. 
1891, when only 1,826 birds were killed, and 1892, 
when there was no shooting' 

This average is 50 per cent higher than that 
of Sir Frederick Milbank during his twelve years' 
tenancy of the same moor, viz. 4,133 birds, although 
his period includes the exceptional total of 1 7,064 in 
1872 j 1 Lord Westbury's highest year being 9,797 in 
1888. This^looks as though the preservation of the 
birds and the ground had reached a more perfect and 
even condition.

On the adjoining moor of High Force enormous 
totals have also been reached, the record of 1872, 
during the Duke of Beaufort's tenancy, showing 15,484 
birds for nineteen days' shooting. On this moor, as 
the guest of the late Mr. Clare Vyner, I took part in 
a wonderful week, averaging over 1,200 birds each 
day for four days, to only six guns. I had the best 
drive I have ever seen, picking up 115 birds in the 
single drive. I had knocked down 145, but owing to 
pressure of time and much thick bracken near my butt, 
which in the heat of an August day gave the dogs no 
chance, I had to leave thirty birds on the ground, 
most of which, however, came into the pick-up 
announced next day. 

It is curious that Lord de Grey should have also 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 259 

had his biggest drive, 128 birds, later on the same 
day, especially since we have both taken part in 
larger bags than the total of that particular occa- 
sion. 

Lord de Grey, who is admittedly the best game 
shot of our generation, and who has of course 
immense experience, has killed to his own gun 575 
grouse in one day, shooting as one of a party of seven 
guns on the Studley Royal moors. Sir Frederick 
Milbank's performance ' exceeds this in numbers, and 
will probably, as the performance of an individual 
making one of a party of guns, never be surpassed. 
Lord de Grey's view is that, without disparagement 
of any such feat as this or Lord Walsingham's, which 
is only possible to a first-rate man, there is a great 
deal of luck as to whether the chance ever presents 
itself to perform it, and that the general shooting 
throughout a succession of days under every variety of 
condition is the test which the most experienced will 
apply to a man's form. 

It is necessary to notice an exceptional per- 
formance, and to recognise it as such. It is rarely 
achieved but by the first-rate man, and does not alter 
the general conditions which govern the sport in 

1 Badminton Library, Moor and Marsh, p. 37.

260 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



question. We can all remember how when Mr. W. 
G. Grace produced a series of scores such as had 
never been dreamt of in the cricket field, people 
began to talk of altering the rules to assist the 
bowlers ; of adding a stump, or narrowing the pro- 
portions of the bat, in order to restore the balance of 
the game. But these scores, like those named above, 
now remain recorded as the meteors or comets in the 
celestial field of great reputations, of rare and spas- 
modic recurrence, and valuable only as a standard of 
possibility to stimulate minor constellations to greater 
brilliancy. 

The first-rate performer, as before remarked, is 
good under all circumstances. I have met those who 
have seen W. G. Grace in a rustic cricket match, or 
John Roberts on a country house table, just as I have 
seen De Grey walking for an ordinary bag of partridges, 
or pursuing the occasional snipe or rabbit. The per- 
formance shows the same excellence under all these 
circumstances, and the quality which excites merely 
pleasure and admiration under the average conditions 
should not produce jealousy or carping criticism when 
reproduced on the rare opportunity which admits of 
the execution of a sensational feat. 

There is no danger of the frequent recurrence of 
Lord Walsingham's 500 brace in a day, of Lord de 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 261 



Grey's 240 partridges in one drive, 1 of John Robert's 
spot-barred break of 1,300 odd, or of Dr. Grace's 
hundreds in an innings. The first-rate form which 
gradually builds up a great reputation is sure on some 
rare occasion, when all conditions are favourable, to 
produce an exceptional or startling feat ; but there is 
no reason on this account to imagine that all the 
ordinary rules of the sport in question are to be sub- 
versed by this meteoric performance, or to deplore the 
fact that the result exceeds what had been foreseen. 
These isolated achievements, properly considered, do 
no harm, but on the contrary merely serve to raise 
the general standard of excellence in all outdoor 
amusements which it has always been the pride of the 
Englishman to maintain before the world. Some 
fifty years ago Colonel Campbell of Monzie made 
bags to his own gun over dogs which have never been 
surpassed, excepting perhaps on one occasion by the 
late Maharajah Duleep Singh. 2 I do not think any 

1 This is, no doubt, the record for an individual perform- 
ance in a partridge drive ; the feat, which I give on Lord de 
Grey's own authority, was performed by him last year, 1893, 
at Baron de Hirsch's in Hungary. 

* Colonel Campbell killed in one day in 1843, 184^ brace 
of grouse ; in 1846, 191 brace; and on the authority of ' Hark- 
away ' is said on another day to have killed 222| brace. 
The Maharajah Duleep Singh in 1872 bagged 220 brace in 
a day. 



262 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

bad consequences have followed these rare feats. If 
they have, as is probably the case, stimulated others to 
improve their shooting and the management of their 
moors, they have done more good than harm, and 
merely resulted in an increase in the supply of grouse 
available as food or sport for those who own moor- 
land estates. 

As remarked before, the best black-game ground 
is undoubtedly to be found on the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch's large estates in Dumfriesshire, while on other 
ground in the border counties, as well as in Perth- 
shire and Aberdeenshire, they have been killed in 
considerable numbers. 

The Duke of Buccleuch kindly furnishes me 
with the following totals of the five best years on his 
Drumlanrig Castle property : 



1861 1,586 

1865 1,530 



1869 1,508 h Black -game 

1870 1,486 

1871 1,429' 

These are diminishing totals, as will be observed, 
and I regret to say that his Grace adds that the 
numbers are still growing less, though there is little 
or no poaching on his ground. But I must recur to 
the subject of illegally killed game, and have no 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 263 

hesitation in putting down the diminished numbers 
to the account of the poulterers in London and 
elsewhere. Perhaps some one well acquainted with 
Norway will tell us from what part of that country 
the large supplies with which it is credited come to 
our markets ! 

Here is the best bag ever made on the Duke's 
ground : 

SANQUHAR, DUMFRIESSHIRE 

Grouse ..... 5 
Black-game .... 247

Total . . . 316 

the guns including H.R.H. Prince Christian, the late 
Duke of Buccleuch, and eight others. Of the 247 
black-game over 100 brace were cocks, and I fancy 
this constitutes the record bag of these birds. 

In 1874, at Newlands near Langholm, another of 
the Duke's estates on the Border, the present Duke 
and Colonel Francis Cust bagged 98 black-game, 81 
cocks and 17 greyhens, in one day, starting late and 
having only one gun each. The Duke informs me that 
if they had begun earlier and had taken two guns each 



264 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



they could easily have killed 60 brace or more. This, 
especially considering the date, October 9, is the 
best day I ever heard of for two guns. 

Of capercailzie, probably no greater quantity 
has ever been killed than on the day mentioned by 
Mr. Millais, 70 in one day, on the Dowager Duchess 
of Athole's ground near Dunkeld ; while the 35 cocks 
shot at Ballinling by a party of whom Mr. Millais was 
one, is seldom, if ever, likely to be equalled. 

These birds having many years ago become 
extinct in this country, were, as is well known, re- 
introduced by the second Marquess of Breadalbane at 
Taymouth, and have spread over most of the lowland 
counties of Scotland. So far as I have seen they keep 
very much to themselves, and I should say without 
doubt contrive to drive away black -game from their 
especial haunts, though they remain on fairly friendly 
terms with pheasants, woodcocks, and other game. 
They have never been found yet on the English side 
of the Border, though black-game have been killed in 
nearly every county in England and Wales, some- 
times within a short distance of London itself. Mr. 
Millais mentions the curious instance of a black- 
cock and a hansom cab coming within the range of 
his acute vision at the same time in the neighbourhood 
of Aldershot. There is only one way to ' transplant 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 265 

these birds into a new country by procuring the eggs 
and putting them into pheasant or partridge nests, the 
former, of course, for choice. But they go where they 
list ; they will not stay if the country does not suit 
them, but will travel for miles until they find congenial 
cover and food, even as they have led me in this little 
work far away from their recognised home and com- 
panions, the heather and the grouse. 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

BY 

GEORGE SAINTSBURY 



THE COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

I HAVE always regretted (but never so much as 
since I undertook the duty of these chapters) that I 
did not preserve a French book on game and its 
cookery which passed through my hands some years 
ago. The author frankly admitted that grouse do not 
live in France, though black-game of course are found 
there. But he wished to be complete, and moreover, 
as he very justly observed, some of his French readers 
might have one or more brace of grouse sent him by 
an English friend, and then what was he to do ? So 
he gave with great pride what he was pleased to call 
a receipt for ' Grouse a la Dundy.' Dundy, I remem- 
ber, he defined as being not only the gamiest, la plus 
giboyeuse, city of Scotland, but also renowned for every 
variety of refinement of taste and luxury superior in 
short to Peebles itself. And the way that they cooked 
grouse in Dundy was but that is exactly what I have 
forgotten. To the best of my memory it was like 



270 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

most French fashions of cooking game a sufficiently 
ingenious method of making the best of any natural 
flavour that the bird might have, and imbuing it with 
a good many others, not at all disagreeable, but super- 
added rather than evolved or assisted, a method useful 
enough for old birds or indifferent birds, but improper 
for others. 

This process could nowhere be more a counsel of 
imperfection than in the case of grouse ; which, I ven- 
ture to think, has of all game birds the most distinct 
and the least surpassable flavour. There are those, 
of course, who will put in claims for others, and this 
is not the place to fight the matter out. I shall only 
say that while nearly all game birds are good, and 
some eminently good, grouse seems to me to be the 
best, to possess the fullest and at the same time the 
least violent flavour to have the best consistency of 
flesh and to present the greatest variety of attractions 
in different parts. It has become almost an affectation 
to speak of the excellence of his back ; let us rather 
say that he is all good back and breast, legs and 
wings. 

Black-game, capercailzie, and ptarmigan are but 
varieties of grouse, and almost everything that applies 
to the red grouse applies to them. Indeed, the ex- 
cellent Baron Brisse characteristically includes both 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 271 

black-game and capercailzie in saying that there are 
two kinds of coq de bruyere, the one about the size of 
a peacock, the other about the size of a pheasant. 
All three birds, it is scarcely necessary to say, have, 
owing to their habitat and food, a much stronger 
flavour than the red grouse ; and it depends very much 
on the predominance or moderation of this flavour 
whether they are intolerable, tolerable, or excellent. 
Moreover, in the case of two of them at least, English 
estimation of them is wont to be injuriously affected 
by the importation of vast numbers of ptarmigan 
and capercailzie from the North of Europe, without 
the slightest regard to their fitness for food. I have 
seen it stated, indeed, that most of the Norwegian 
capercailzie which are sold in English shops are 
poached by illegal and unsportsmanlike processes, 
at the very time when they are most out of season. 
Ptarmigan soup, however, is quite excellent, and I am 
not sure that even grouse at its best can give points 
to a roast greyhen in good condition. But partly 
because of the strong nature of their food whereof 
pine and juniper shoots and seeds are the chief parts 
and partly because they are stronger flying birds, and 
therefore tougher than the red grouse, black-game 
require even more keeping than that ' estimable vola- 
tile.' The whole tribe, indeed, will bear this process 



272 COOKER 'Y OF THE GROUSE 



as no other birds will. It was the custom of a hospit- 
able friend of mine in Scotland, who was equally good 
with rod and gun, to keep a supply of grouse hanging 
till he could accompany them with salmon caught in a 
river which was by no means a very early opening one, 
and I never found birds taste better. The less regarded 
members of the grouse tribe will, as I have said, bear 
much longer keeping. Indeed, the best if not the 
only really good capercailzie that I ever tasted had 
been subjected to the indignity of being forgotten. 
He was imported into the Channel Islands by an 
enterprising game dealer ; I bought him, and as the 
house in which I was living had no good larder, I 
asked the man to keep him on his own premises till 
he and we were ready. We promptly forgot all about 
him, and it was several weeks before the shamefaced 
dealer, who was equally oblivious, said one day, ' I'm 
afraid, sir, that capercailzie . . . ! ' Nevertheless we 
had him sent home. It was necessary to amputate 
and discard a considerable part of him, but the rest 
was altogether admirable. 

With all these birds, but especially with ptarmigan, 
dryness is the great thing to be feared when roasting 
them ; and this must be guarded against by liberal 
basting, by jackets of bacon, and in other well-known 
ways, especially, perhaps, by the German method of 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 273 

marinading and larding given below. Except in soup, 
old birds of all the three kinds are very nearly hopeless, 
and should not be attempted. And though in the 
abstract most, if not all, of the methods of what may 
be called applied grouse-cookery are applicable to 
them, it is well to remember that the extremely strong 
flavour above referred to marries itself but awkwardly 
to miscellaneous additions, and is almost impossible 
simply to disguise with them. Indeed, it is noteworthy 
that even French cookery books do not as a rule 
meddle much with the coq de bruyere, but prefer him 
plain. Nor does any of the tribe make a very good 
devil. ' Tickler,' indeed, in the Nodes Ambrosiance, 
avoucheth that even eagle's thigh is good devilled ; but 
the context does not inspire complete confidence in 
the good faith of the sage of Southside at that moment. 
On the whole, it may be laid down that black-game 
and capercailzie (the latter when young and in very 
good condition) are best roasted, ptarmigan stewed or 
converted into soup. But I must own that I have 
eaten roast ptarmigan which left the room (at least 
the bones did) without a stain on their character 
which were ' white birds ' as much metaphorically as 
literally. 

With these preliminary remarks and cautions as 
to the outlying varieties we may turn to the cooking 

T 



274 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



of grouse proper. For very obvious reasons the anti- 
quarian part of the matter needs but little attention. 
Until railway-and-steamboat-time grouse were any- 
thing but common in London and exceedingly un- 
common in Paris, and the chef of literary tendencies 
was not likely to trouble himself much about them. 
Their rarity in the former place is exemplified in the 
well-known though doubtless apocryphal legend of the 
Highland chieftain who ordered ' grouse and salmon ' 
for his domestics at a London hotel. And the books 
said very little about them. For instance, a lady had 
the great kindness to examine for me a country-house 
collection of cookery books, English, Scotch, French, 
and American, extending to some score of volumes, 
and all printed between 1790 and 1830. They yielded 
practically nothing but the direction 'Roast moor-game 
half an hour : serve with fried bread crumbs, bread 
sauce, and sliced raw onions in a little water in the 
same boat,' and the still more general advice to ' dress 
them like partridges and send them up with currant 
jelly and fried bread crumbs.' It is somewhat interest- 
ing to notice that the onion sauce (or rather salad) here 
suggested is neither more nor less than a degraded 
and barbarous survival of the onion puree which, as 
was noted in the volume on the Partridge in this series, 
Gervase Markham had prescribed for that bird some 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 275 



two centuries earlier. As for the currant jelly I think it 
hardly survives now, but for people who like currant 
jelly with flesh or fowl it is not bad with grouse, while 
as usual cranberry or rowan-berry jelly is better still. 
German and American cooks also sometimes re- 
commend //w/-sauce. But in connection with the 
general direction to ' cook them like partridges ' I am 
tempted to add two receipts for dressing that bird 
which I did not know at the time of writing on it, but 
which seem admirably adapted to grouse also, and 
which come from the collection referred to above. 
They appear in La Cuisine de Sante, an elaborate 
work in three volumes written by M. Jourdain Le 
Cointe, and revised in the year 1790 by a medical 
practitioner of Montpellier. This latter man of art, by 
the way, seems during that stirring time to have been 
as unpolitically engaged as his brother savant who was 
indifferent to the Revolution because he had an un- 
precedented number of irregular verbs all nicely 
conjugated and written out in his desk. 

The first of these receipts is called a la Sultane, 
and is described as one of the favourite dishes of 
Venetian cookery ; the other, also asserted to be 
Italian in origin, is a la cendre. 

For birds a la Sultane you take four, and sacrifice 
the least promising of the quartette to make a farce for 

T 2 



276 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

the other three, with the usual accompaniment of 
mushrooms, anchovies, &c. You then, having stuffed 
the others, lard them not merely with bacon but 
with anchovies and truffles, and roast them before a 
not too fierce fire, basting them till they are two-thirds 
done with good consomme. ' II unit 1'agrement et la 
salubrite,' says of this dish M. Jourdain le Comte or 
the Montpellier doctor, evidently leaning back in his 
chair with a sense of satisfaction after writing the 
words. It would be interesting to try this receipt 
with grouse, and I think it would answer, though I 
should be disposed to omit the anchovies. The other 
manner, a lacendre, contains a slight puzzle to me. It 
is directed that the birds, jacketed in bacon and stuffed 
with the usualfarce made of one of their number, shall 
each be wrapped with extreme care, so that no part is 
uncovered, in a large sheet of white paper strewed with 
sliced truffles. Each packet being carefully tied up 
with packthread is buried in hot ashes, turning it if 
necessary till cooked. Our authority says that this 
way of cooking is very popular in Italy, but to his think- 
ing dries the birds too much and deprives them of their 
qualite restaurante. That, I should say, would depend 
on the stuffing and jacketting. But what sort of paper is 
it that will stand the heat of ashes hot enough to cook a 
partridge through ? Burnt-paper ash is not the nicest 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 277 

of condiments, and, moreover, the phrase 'sortez-les 
du papier ' at the end of the article implies that the 
wrapping is ex hypothesi intact. Perhaps somebody who 
has a hearth and wood-ashes at his or her disposal 
will try the method. 

Turning to modern and straightforward cookery, I 
observe that some critics, while speaking very amiably of 
my efforts in alien art on the partridge, have been pleased 
to speak compassionately of my preference of plain roast 
bird as ' very English.' I hope that nothing worse will 
ever be said of any taste of mine; and that, as accord- 
ing to a famous axiom, ' it is permissible to Dorians to 
speak Doric,' so it may be permissible to Englishmen to 
eat English food. At any rate, though I have just given 
some and shall hope to give several other receipts for 
more elaborate dealing, I must repeat and emphasise 
the same preference here. A plainly and perfectly 
roasted grouse, with the accompaniments above re- 
ferred to (or others, such as chipped or ribboned 
potatoes), is so good that he can in no other way be 
improved, though of course he may be varied. Some 
extreme grouse-eaters even declare that you ought to 
eat nothing at all but grouse at the same meal ; and 
though I cannot go with them there, I am thoroughly 
of the mind of a certain wise and gracious hostess who 
once said to me, ' I have given you very few things 



278 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

for dinner to-day ; for there is grouse, and I think 
grouse is a dinner.' Certainly it is rather wicked to 
eat a mere snippet of it at the end of a dinner of soup, 
fish, half a dozen entrees, and very likely a solid rehvc. 
The soup and the fish and one entree ought to be 
ample when grouse in sufficient quantity forms the 
roast. Also grouse forms a better ' solid ' than any- 
thing else that I know to finish a fish dinner with 
there is some subtle and peculiar appropriateness in 
its specially earthy and dry savour as a contrast to the 
fishinesses. For accompanying vegetables nothing can 
equal French beans, which Nature supplies at the right 
time exactly, and for drinking to match, nothing can 
even approach claret, good, but not too good. Not 
' forty thousand college councils ' shall ever persuade me 
but that it is something of a solecism and something 
of a sin to drink the very best Bordeaux with any solid 
food whatever. That should be drunk with a recueille- 
ment which is impossible to the palate when it is 
simultaneously called to deal with the grosser act of 
eating. Let, therefore, the host, however fortunate 
and liberal, keep the First Three and also his best 
Leovilles and Rauzans, Moutons and Pichon Longue- 
villes, for the time when the grouse has vanished ; 
but let him accompany it while it is being discussed 
with anything up to Palmer or Lagrange, or even 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 279 

such second growths as Cos Destournel or Durfort. 
Not that Burgundy (again just short of the very best) 
goes ill with grouse, but that claret goes better. Alexis 
Soyer, who, though I have heard good judges declare 
him to have been a very overrated cook, said some 
excellent things, soon to be quoted, about grouse, re- 
commends a ' little sweet champagne ' with grouse. It 
was spoken like a Frenchman. 

The accompaniments of roast grouse, besides those 
already mentioned, are not very numerous. The liver 
of the birds cooked separately, pounded and spread 
upon the toast on which they are served, with 
butter, salt, and cayenne, is often recommended. 
Most people are unhappy without gravy ; for myself 
I think if the grouse is properly done, not too much 
and not too dry, it is better without any. The favourite, 
and to the general taste indispensable, bread crumbs 
are often horribly ill cooked, and unless very well 
cooked are the reverse of appetising. Soyer, as above 
reported by a good Scotch writer on cookery, who 
calls herself ' Jenny Wren,' liked to eat grouse, which 
he justly declared to vary inexplicably in flavour from 
year to year, ' absolutely by themselves with nothing 
but a crust of bread,' and this shows a purity of taste 
which makes one almost forgive him his sweet cham- 
pagne therewith. Watercress is as good with grouse 



2 So COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



as with most roasted birds, and salad almost as good 
as with any ; though perhaps the brown-fleshed birds 
do not so imperatively call for this adjunct as the 
white. I seem to have heard that there were times 
and places where grouse were eaten with melted 
butter ; but it is well known that there were times 
and seasons when there was hardly anything to which 
Britons did not add that unlovely trimming. It must 
be confessed that the thing is still done (the trimming 
being actually poured over the birds) in Scotland, 
where they certainly understand cookery, and where 
they ought to understand that of grouse in particular. 
But it seems to me an abomination, and it must be 
remembered that if Scottish cookery, admirable as it 
is, has a tendency to sin, that tendency is in the 
direction of what is delicately called ' richness,' and 
that this may be an instance. No doubt the counter 
tendency of the grouse to the other original sin of 
dryness has also to be considered. 

There is a good deal more dispute as to the time, 
or in other words the degree, to which grouse ought to 
be roasted than in regard to most other garni birds. 
Nobody not, I should suppose, even an ogre or a 
cannibal likes underdone pheasant ; and I never heard 
of anybody who liked underdone partridge. On the 
other hand, only very unfortunately constituted persons 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 281 



(who should not eat wild- or water-fowl at all) like wild 
duck or widgeon, or anything of that kind, from solan 
geese to plovers, otherwise than distinctly underdone. 
But in regard to grouse it is impossible to say that 
there is a distinctly orthodox or a distinctly heterodox 
school in this respect. The ambiguity of general 
opinion is shown by the variation in time from twenty 
minutes to half an hour usually allotted for the roast- 
ing of an average-sized young bird (I have even 
seen three-quarters advised, but this is utterly pre- 
posterous). This amounts to the difference between 
a distinct redness close to the bone and 'cooking 
through.' There is even a school who would have 
grouse decidedly underdone. I think they are wrong, 
and that there should be nothing in the very least 
saignant about a grouse when he is carved, but that, 
if possible, he should be taken away from the fire the 
very minute that the last possibility of such a trace 
has disappeared. 

The other two simple ways of cooking grouse (I 
suppose men do boil them, just as they boiled Lord 
Soulis, but I never knew a case) are broiling and con- 
version into soup. A broiled or ' brandered ' grouse 
is quite admirable, but must of course be quite young, 
plentifully buttered (or oiled), and fairly peppered. 
When successfully done it is like all broiled birds, one 



282 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



of the very best things that it is possible to eat, and can 
be accompanied by an almost unlimited variety of sauces 
or gravies, from the plainest to the most elaborate. 
The same hyperbole may be used of grouse soup when 
it is what grouse soup should be. There are consider- 
able variations in the methods of preparing it; and, as in 
most cases, it is necessary to look to the end or object. 
Philosophically considered, the whole subject of soup 
may be divided into three parts. There is soup more 
or less clear, such as is probably at the present moment 
chiefly in favour as being most restorative in effect and 
most elegant in consumption. There is a puree of 
creamy texture, thick, but not containing any positive 
solids. And lastly there is the old-fashioned broth 
with solids in it, which is more an olla or stew than 
a soup strictly speaking, and which, though a little 
robust and massive for our modern dinners, is one of 
the most satisfactory varieties of food for reasonably 
hungry people. The first of these forms is that in 
which grouse soup is least commonly presented, and 
to which perhaps this bird lends itself least characteris- 
tically. It is, however, good in its way, and I never 
saw a better receipt for it than that which is given by 
Mrs. Henry Reeve. You take old, but quite fresh 
birds, which may be either grouse or black -game, or 
(I should add) ptarmigan. You add water at the rate 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 283 

of three pints to the brace of birds, and keep it sim- 
mering as slowly as possible for hours, adding pepper- 
corns and a little onion and carrot. Some time before 
serving you take the best pieces of the breast out 
(the birds of course have been cut up at first), press 
them and cut them up in little bits to add to the 
strained soup. 

Puree of grouse is much more in request and for 
those who can consume thick soups much better. 
The apparent variety of receipts for it is great ; the 
real, smaller. All can be reduced, with little difficulty, 
to a common form. The birds are roasted, but not 
so long as if they were going to be simply eaten a 
quarter of an hour is generally held to be enough. All 
or most of the meat is then removed from the bones, 
which are put into a sufficient quantity of ready- 
made clear stock or consomme, with vegetables and 
seasonings to taste. This is allowed to simmer from 
one to three hours, the longer the better. Meanwhile, 
the meat which was taken off is pounded in a mortar 
and pressed through a sieve, some adding butter and 
grated biscuit or toasted bread, others ground rice, 
others nothing but seasoning. This paste is then 
stirred into the strained soup till it attains the required 
thickness. Celery in moderation is an important in- 
gredient in puree of grouse, and some send lemon 



284 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

with it to table ; but lemon is one of those good things 
which are liable to abuse in cookery, in regard to meats 
and fowls. It is more at home with fish and sweets. 

Of the ruder and more national form (which is 
also, I think, the best) of grouse soup, the celebrated 
stew whereof Meg Merrilies made Dominie Sampson 
partake was probably a variety, though the authority 
saith that moor-game were not the only ingredient of 
that soup or broth or stew. The beginning is the 
same as for puree, and indeed puree and this sort of 
soup melt into each other by imperceptible gradations. 
For you may either roast the birds as in the former 
case, cut off the best of the meat, break up and 
slightly pound the rest, fry it with butter, some ham 
and vegetables, and then stew it with good stock, in 
quantity sufficient (some say a quart to a bird), and 
after straining put the best pieces of meat in at the 
last moment, to warm up with a glass of claret. Or 
you may cut up the birds into joints to begin with, 
fry them in butter, and then add the stock, the vege- 
tables and the etceteras, proceeding in ordinary soup 
fashion till the thing is done. Some in this last stage 
advocate the adding of a young cabbage in pieces, 
with wine or not, as liked. And as the birds have, 
in this case, no ordinary cooking but the slight fry, 
and no pounding or other mollification, it is necessary 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 285 

to ' simmer till tender,' which in the case of an old 
grouse or black-cock may be a considerable time. 
For the really hungry man this is, no doubt, the best 
way of all ; but as a dinner dish it is perhaps, as has 
been hinted, too solid for the mere overture to which 
we have now reduced soup. In the days of the 
ancestors, they ate it late instead of early in the order 
of dishes ; and I am not certain that they were wrong. 
There are few things more engaging about grouse 
than the excellent appearance that it makes in cold 
cookery, whether by itself, in salads, or in pies. 
Chaudfroid of grouse (it is quite useless for purists to 
warn us that the word has nothing to do with chaud 
and nothing with//wV, that its being chaud is an acci- 
dent, and that its creator was one Chauffroix) is excel- 
lent. So are grouse potted whole (baked, with wine 
and butter, and afterwards stowed singly into pots with 
clarified butter poured over), or in joints, or in pounded 
paste. So is the cold roast bird in the severest 
simplicity, especially if he has not been cut into when 
hot. So is grouse salad, of which a savoury, but rather 
violent, if not even slightly vulgar, variety assigned to 
Soyer is to be found in all the books with more or 
fewer changes. The general principle is that, the joints 
of not too much roasted grouse being laid on a bed 
of salad and fenced round with garnishings of hard- 



286 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

boiled egg, gherkins, beetroot, &c., a dressing of what 
the French would call an unusually corse kind is poured 
over and if possible slightly iced. In the most aggressive 
prescription I have seen for this, no less than two table- 
spoonfuls of chopped shallots and as much of tarragon 
and chervil figure. But anybody who can make a 
salad at all can, of course, adjust the dressing to his 
or her fancy, and the garnishing likewise. 

Grouse pie is of a higher order than these, although 
the odd changes of fashion have banished it from the 
chief meal of the day to breakfast, luncheon, and 
supper, at neither of which does anything better often 
appear. I do not know that anybody eats grouse pie 
hot, though I can conceive no particular or valid 
reason against it. It may be made, of course, in 
all the gradations of pies the homely old variety with 
edible crust, the ' raised pie,' whereof the crust is not 
intended to be eaten, though persons of unsophisticated 
habits and healthy appetite may be observed some- 
times to attempt the feat and the pie in which there 
is no pretence of crust at all, but which is concocted in 
a more or less ornamental case of fireproof china. (It 
was this last, perhaps, of which the poet of the Lakes, 
where there is much moor-game, wrote ' celestial with 
terrine ' though his foolish printers usually spell it 
'terrene.') And so the complexity of the materials 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 287 



and methods observes similar gradations, which by 
connection or accident very often adjust themselves 
to the three varieties of casing just mentioned. The 
simplest form of grouse pie merely requires the birds 
(jointed, halved, or sometimes whole), a proportion 
(a pound to a brace is usual) of rump steak cut into 
knobs, seasoning, crust, and a sufficiency of good gravy 
(which may or may not be touched up with lemon 
juice and claret) to fill up and moisten the mixture. 
To this, of course, the usual enrichments of hard eggs 
(whether of the domestic fowl or, as the youthful heir 
of Glenroy in Destiny suggests, plovers' eggs), mush- 
rooms, truffles, forcemeat balls, and so forth, may be 
added. These additions may further be said to be 
customary in the raised grouse pie, and invariable in 
that which is made in a terrine. These latter forms 
merge themselves very much in the general 'game 
pie,' an excellent thing in its way no doubt. But I 
do not know that it is so good as the simple grouse 
pie with nothing added but steak, seasoning, an 
alliaceous touch of some sort, and a few eggs and 
mushrooms. 

And so we come at last to the more elaborate 
varieties of cooking this noble animal. In that utter- 
ance of Soyer's above quoted he is made to confess 
that 'his art cannot improve grouse,' that in good 



288 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



years the flavour is such as to baffle more ornamental 
treatment, while in others there is nothing particular 
to be done with the fowl. Nevertheless, people will 
do things with it ; and some of the things they do 
must be told with the general caution, or at least 
opinion, that they are vanity. In the first place there 
is a way of pressing grouse which, since the initial 
process is to boil or stew the bird to rags, must be 
specially applicable, and should be chiefly or only 
applied, to the very oldest specimens. Having inflicted 
this fiery and watery torment on them you pull the 
meat oft" the bones, season it pretty freely, and clothe 
it with jelly (either with ordinary aspic or by fortifying 
the liquor in which it was boiled with gelatine), adding 
eggs, truffles, and anything else you please before 
letting it get solid in a mould or dish. It stands to 
reason that this is only a way though not at all a 
bad way of using birds not otherwise eatable. 

Salmis of grouse stands much higher indeed, it 
is probably the best of its kind, except that made of 
wild duck ; and inasmuch as there must always be 
remnants of roast birds, it is almost a necessary sup- 
plement to simpler cookery, besides being extremely 
good of itself. But it is necessary to remember several 
things about a salmis. The first is, that though the 
birds are always cooked first, it is indispensable that 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 289 



the sauce or gravy, or whatever you choose to call 
it, should have a thorough flavour of them, which 
is not to be attained by merely warming the pieces of 
game in it. This may be given, of course, in various 
ways, either by stewing the bones, skin, trimmings, 
and less worthy pieces of the grouse in the stock used, 
or by adding some puree or ' essence of game ; ' but it 
must be attained somehow. The next thing to re- 
member is that this gravy or sauce when finished 
should never be a mere bath or slop. Madame Lebour- 
Fawssett says it should be ' of the consistency of well- 
made melted butter,' and I agree with her. Lastly, re- 
member that there must always be wine in a salmis; and 
that it is of great importance what wine it is. English 
books will recommend port or sherry, which, in my 
humble judgment, are extremely bad wines for all 
savoury cooking purposes. Pale dry sherry is, for 
that end, mostly quite useless, though I own that if 
I were rich I should try the experiment of boiling a 
ham in Manzanilla. The now despised, though in 
its way gorgeous, 'old brown' is apt to overpower 
every other flavour, and is too sweet, objections which 
apply still more strongly to port and even to Madeira, 
which is sometimes recommended, and which is cer- 
tainly preferable to either port or sherry. Besides, all 
these wines, and still more the brown ' cooking ' 

U 



290 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



brandy, which it is whispered is sometimes used, 
provoke undue thirst and general discomfort. A sound 
red Bordeaux with flavour and some body for brown 
meats, and a good (not an acid or wiry) Chablis or 
Pouilly for white, are probably the best things for 
the purpose. And I must again praise the French 
lady above cited for recommending equal parts of 
stock and wine as the main body of salmis sauce. 
The mixture is added to a foundation of well-warmed 
and browned butter and flour, plenty of seasoning, 
including herbs, some shallot rather than onion, 
and at the last a little lemon juice, remembering the 
warnings above given. Nothing more but patience, 
careful watching, and still greater care when the game 
has been put in the mixture never to let it boil, 
is required lo make a good salmis. But all this 
is required, and without it the thing cannot be a 
success. 

There is no perceptible difference between the 
better class of receipts for hashing grouse and those 
for a salmis of it. If there is any, it is that the hash 
gravy may be a little thinner ; but that is a matter of 
taste, and it is not uncommon to find cookery books 
in which the titles of the receipts for the two processes 
might be changed and little or no harm done. The 
fact is that ' salmis ' (a term of which even the great 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 291 

I jttre did not know the origin, but which I venture 
to think a mere abbreviation of ' salmigondis ') is 
neither more nor less than a hash or ragout of game 
or wild birds, which has had its name extended with- 
out strict propriety to the tame duck, but no farther. 

Stewed grouse, which is, or was, common in Scot- 
land, is a sort of application of the process of hashing 
to birds not previously cooked, and presumably old. 
You cut them up, fry them with butter and shallot, or 
garlic, take out the latter and then simmer them gently 
for half an hour with equal but not large quantities 
of stock and wine. There should be a good deal of 
pepper. 

Grouse can of course be made into quenelles, kro- 
meskisy croquettes, salpicons, Vouchees, and all the other 
varieties of rissoles in which pounded or minced meat 
is conveyed into fanciful and easily consumed shapes 
of small size. They might be made into a pain or 
quenelle on a great scale ; they can be scuffled, and 
are very good so. It is further obvious and easy to 
stuff them in roasting or accompany them in pieces 
with all kinds of forcemeat, from the simplest to the 
most complicated, from the plain liver-and-bread- 
crumb to compounds a lafinanciere and a la Lucullus, 
in which truffles and cockscombs and the like figure. 
Grouse cutlets the birds being usually halved, partly 



292 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

boned, fried, and then simmered in espagnole or some 
similar sauce are well enough, and can be sophisti- 
cated before being served up by having truffles and 
other associations stuck on them. It is also some- 
times recommended that they should be prepared in 
this way before being made into a pie. 

Most of the books contain a receipt usually stated 
(conscientiously) to be German, for marinading grouse, 
which might be useful either in the case of birds 
accidentally kept too long or in that of very aged ones, 
or, as observed above, to tame the wildness of the 
rougher members of the tribe. Otherwise I cannot 
conceive it to be necessary to treat good red grouse 
in this way, however useful something of the same 
kind may be to make pork taste like wild boar, rabbit 
like hare, and very dry roe-venison like the flesh of a 
hart of grease. You take (the particulars never vary) 
a quarter of a pint of vinegar, a score of juniper berries, 
some peppercorns, and two or three bay leaves. You 
steep the birds in this for three days, frequently 
turning them and spooning the marinade over them. 
You then stuff them with turkey stuffing, lard the 
breasts, roast and serve. 

But after this and the other things the mind returns 
from these excesses to the elegance of a good roast 
grouse simple of himself, with some such a feeling as 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 293 

that which ' Neville Temple and Edward Trevor ' 
attributed long ago to Tannhauser when 

a dewy sense 
Of innocent worship stole 

over his heated brain and sense as he contemplated 
the Princess after his return from the Venusberg. It 
is true that the ingenious wickedness of some may 
draw a bad moral in favour of variety even from this 
comparison ; but on their heads be it.

PREFACE 



THE design of the Fur and FcatJier Scries is to 
present monographs, as complete as they can 
possibly be made, on the various English birds 
and beasts which arc generally included under 
the head of Game. 

Books on Natural History cover such a vast 
number of subjects that their writers necessarily 
find it impossible to deal with each in a really 
comprehensive manner ; and it is not within 
the scope of such works exhaustively to discuss 
the animals described, in the light of objects of 
sport. Books on sport, again, seldom treat at 
length of the Natural History of the furred and 
feathered creatures which arc shot or otherwise 
taken ; and, so far .as the Editor is aware, in no 
book hitherto published on Natural History or 
Sport has information been given as to the best 
methods of turning the contents of the bag to 
account.

vi PREFACE 

Each volume of the present Series will, 
therefore, be devoted to a bird or beast, and 
will be divided into three parts. The Natural 
History of the species will first be given ; it 
will then be considered from the point of view 
of sport ; and the writer of the third division 
will assume that the creature has been carried 
to the larder, and will proceed to discuss it gas- 
tronomically. The origin of the animals will 
be traced, their birth and breeding described, 
every known method of circumventing and 
killing them not omitting the methods em- 
ployed by the poacher will be explained with 
special regard to modern developments, and 
they will only be left when on the table in the 
most appetising forms which the delicate science 
of cookery has discovered. 

It is intended to make the illustrations a 
prominent feature of the Series. The pictures 
in the present volume are after drawings by 
Mr. A. J. Stuart-Wortley and Mr. A. Thor- 
burn. All of them, including the diagrams, 
have been designed under the supervision of 
the first-named.

NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSIi 

BY THE 

REV. H. A. MACPHERSON 



CHAPTER I 

IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 

IT is hardly too much to say that the Red Grouse 
enjoys a unique position among the members of the 
feathered community. Certainly no other bird exacts 
a similar amount of homage from its admirers, or 
affords as large a share of enjoyment to sportsmen. 
In these days of increasing taxation, it would go hard 
with many of us Highland lairds if we had no grouse 
moors from which to draw the rates which go to 
support school boards and other luxuries exacted by 
the oppressive democracy. Scotland is pre-eminently 
the home of this splendid bird a fact to which she 
owes a very large portion of her material prosperity. 
It was a happy hour when the Sassenach discovered 
the pleasure to be gained from renting a Northern 
grouse moor. 

Until then the bird had existed only on sufferance, 
persecuted by many enemies and little cared for by 
anyone. It is true that its value as food was always 



4 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

recognised ; but that circumstance only led to its 
increased pursuit in the days when Englishmen killed 
the ' pootes ' as well as the parent bird in the nesting 
season. Happily those evil days have well-nigh passed 
into oblivion. For us moderns the name of grouse 
has a fragrance of its own. Its bare mention suffices 
to set us dreaming of the fresh, breezy hillside, with 
its varied animal life and endless expanse of purple 
heather. Considering how widely the term grouse 
circulates, there is a certain quaintness in the fact 
that the word is not a British one at all, but only an 
addition to our language and of doubtful origin. 
Our forefathers borrowed the word from abroad, 
apparently from an old French adjective griesche, 
signifying grey or speckled. From this originated a 
plural word grice, printed thus in 1611 by Cotgrave, 
who used it to denote the ' moor-henne,' the female, 
as he tells us, of the ' mooregame.' The grouse was 
originally the moor-fowl, moor-game, moor-cock, or 
muir-fowl, and preserves these titles at the present 
day in many districts of both England and Scotland. 
Willughby called it the red game, and very properly. 
But the plural word grice was early modified into the 
singular grows. Professor Newton has shown that this 
title was first applied to the blackcock, notably in an 
ordinance for the household of Henry VIII., dated 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 5 



from Eltham in the year 1531. Similarly, Charleton 
tells us that two species of the heath-cock or grouss 
are indigenous to Great Britain respectively entitled 
the black game and the grey game. In course of time 
the name grouse, very variously spelt, has, curiously 
enough, come to be applied to the red grouse 
almost exclusively. It may be well to mention that 
some scholars have sought a derivation of grouse in 
the Celtic terms grug= heather and -iar=a hen ; but 
the suggestion has not met with favour. If the origin 
of grouse, however, be somewhat perplexing and I 
for one should be very thankful for further light upon 
the subject it must be allowed that the origin of an- 
other name of the species is still more mysterious. I 
allude to the name gor-cock, which appears to have 
latterly dropped out of use, but which was formerly 
much in vogue both south and north of the Border. 
Professor Newton assures me that he has no clue to 
the etymology of this term, though he thinks it may 
have some connection with the harsh cry of the bird. 
My own belief is that it signifies red-cock, like the 
Gaelic ' Coilleach Ruadh,' referring to the reddish 
plumage of the typical bird. This view has not 
obtained the support of scholars ; but it is borne out 
by the fact that it was current in the seventeenth 
century. Thus Ray writes : ' The Red Game, Lagopus 



NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



altera Plinii, an Attagen Aldrov. In the north of 
England it is called the Gor-cock and Moor-cock, the 
hen the More-hen, the brood Gorfowl. Heath-cock is 
also a name common to this with the precedent. 
Turner's More-hen is the female of the precedent or 
Blackcock. Gor in the north of England signifies red, 
so the Gor- Cock is the red cock, &c. For the under- 
standing and exact distinctions of these names we 
are beholden to Mr. Johnson, of Brignal, in Yorke- 
shirc.' ! 

The prefix ' gor ' has been applied to some other 
birds, notably to the great black-backed gull and to 
the carrion crow. The fishermen of the Solway Firth 
often speak of the great black-backed gull as the ' gor 
maw.' In Oxfordshire, as Mr. O. V. Aplin tells us, 
the carrion crow is still recognised as a ' gor-crow.' 
The syllable 'gor ' seems in these two instances to be 
identical with the Saxon gor (carrion, or refuse), and 
to refer to the fact that both the black-backed gull and 
carrion crow feed upon carrion. Of the appropriate- 
ness of the prefix in these cases there can be no 
question. The gull preys habitually upon such fowl 
as escape wounded from the wildfowler, and often 
attacks a sickly lamb. The carrion crow is equally a 
foul feeder. But with regard to grouse, I think that 

1 77/1,' Ornithology of Francis IVillnghby, \i. 23. 



7.V PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 



' gor ' must refer to the red plumage of the bird, when- 
soever it may have been imported. 

Macgillivray was fond of coining new names for 
English birds, and he thought the grouse should be 
designated the red ptarmigan, The Gaelic names 
usually applied to this species are Coilleach Fraoich= 
the heather-cock, and Cearc Fhraoich=the heather- 
hen. It is also called Ian Fraoich=the heather-bird. 
The term most employed, at any rate in Skye, is the 
Cearc Fhraoich. 

The red grouse is not limited in its distribution 
to the mainland of Scotland. Wherever the common 
ling or heather grows most rapidly and richly, there 
grouse naturally most abound. The islands of 
Scotland are generally inferior to the mainland as 
regards their properties for growing heather in the 
dense profusion which the grouse loves to find. In 
Skye, for instance, the birds are scattered over a wider 
area than on a good Perthshire moor ; in other words, 
they have to range more widely in search of food. 
Of course, we can assist nature considerably by infus- 
ing fresh blood into our insular races. I have not 
tried turning down birds in Skye for more than two 
seasons, and cannot, therefore, speak of, with certainty, 
local results ; but I am assured that the introduction 
of Yorkshire grouse into Rum has greatly increased 



8 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

the bags obtained on that magnificent island. Messrs. 
Harvie Brown and Buckley describe the grouse of the 
Lews as deteriorating in size, and as tending to die 
out, for which they specially blame in-breeding, an 
evil easily remedied, if desired. I believe, myself, that 
the fault lies in the want of zeal of the proprietors, 
who allow enormous numbers of hooded crows to 
exist and to plunder their moors. In Skye we per- 
sistently trap and poison these arch robbers, but we 
cannot get entirely rid of them, because a fresh 
supply is always forthcoming from the Long Island. 
Farther north, there are plenty of grouse in the 
Orkneys, not upon all the islands of the group, but 
upon the majority viz. on the mainland, Hoy, Burray, 
Flotta, Fara, Risa Little, Cava, Eday and Rousay. 
Stragglers occasionally visit the other islands in the 
autumn and winter months. But there are no grouse 
in the Shetlands. There never were any there until 
they were introduced. Their first introduction must 
date back two hundred years, since Brand tells us, in 
1701, that grouse had previously been introduced into 
Shetland, but could not live there. They were 
numerous even then in Orkney, and the Fair Island 
peregrines used to visit Orkney to procure the moor-fowl 
as food for their young. Of late years, several efforts 
have been made to naturalise grouse in Shetland ; but 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 9 

the experiments appear to have been conducted care- 
lessly, and have, so far, proved useless. It was about 
the year 1870 that Mr. D. D. Black, of Kergord, 
endeavoured to establish grouse at the head of 
Weisdale Voe. A quantity of trees were planted at 
the same time to afford shelter to the birds ; but the 
situation did not suit the Norway firs, and they con- 
sequently perished. At last one pair of grouse nested, 
however, because three young birds were caught upon 
Sandness Hill by a woman who carried them to Dr. 
Scott, of Melmby. In 1882, Mr. John Harrison of 
Windhouse, in Yell, procured upwards of forty grouse 
from Scotland for the purpose of turning down ; but, 
unhappily, almost all the consignment perished on 
the way, and only a single pair of birds was set free at 
their destination. These birds nested, and were joined 
in 1885 by five additional pairs. They lingered for some 
time on Yell, and tenanted the island in 1890. In Unst 
a female grouse nested in 1886, but the eggs proved 
unfertile, and the species became locally extinct. -Mr. 
Harold Raeburn, to whom I am indebted for my present 
information, considers that there is no reason why 
grouse should not become perfectly well established 
in Shetland, if sufficient trouble were bestowed upon 
the experiment. The birds would have to face some 
drawbacks here as elsewhere : e.g. the dense popula- 



io NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

tion, the wet and stormy springs, and the sinful 
custom of burning heather all over instead of in suit- 
able strips. Another difficulty in Shetland, as in 
very many places, is the great abundance of the 
hooded crow and other vermin. Mr. Raeburn thinks 
that the peninsula of Roness on the mainland would 
suit grouse particularly well. What is required, if 
grouse are to become naturalised in Shetland, is the 
united effort of the various proprietors, who should 
join together in extirpating vermin, and turn down 
some hundreds of grouse for two or three successive 
seasons. I have no great faith, myself, in the virtue 
of experiments carried out on a small scale ; because 
introduced grouse would have, in the first instance, to 
fight stoutly for existence. 

On the other hand, a well-considered scheme, 
accompanied by remedial measures for the protection 
of heather, would probably result in material benefit 
to the Northern Isles. Upon the Scottish mainland 
the grouse enjoys a general distribution, ranging freely 
over elevated moorlands as well as those situated in 
low-lying districts. A wonderful region of Scotland is 
that which lie's between the high mountains and the 
western seas, bathed in a flood of thin mist or de- 
corated with a variety of soft and soothing tints, 
marvellous reds and browns and greys mingling to- 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE n 

gather in glorious harmony. To lie upon an open 
shelf of rock, from which the sun has newly drawn 
the early dew, to listen silently, and drink in at, leisure, 
all unnoticed, the cries of the wild population that 
hold their own among the pathless hills, this for the 
naturalist is a feast of intellect. Now it is an old male 
capercailzie whose fine bold form appears suddenly 
upon the scene, as he speeds through the top of a 
cluster of Scotch firs, having been rudely startled from 
his favourite perch by some passer-by. Anon, a restless 
curlew sweeps into the field of the binoculars, and pro- 
ceeds to wheel in agitation above the rushy ground in 
which her progeny are skulking, quaint little downy 
morsels with their curious, straightened bills. A wary old 
blackcock comes speeding along the hill in full view 
of us, and a skein of wild duck appear circling over- 
head, wheeling round and round at a vast height from 
the earth. If we lingered a few minutes longer, we 
should surely be visited by a blue merlin, or, perhaps, 
a tercel might favour us with a morning call. Much 
of the charm with which the hills are invested is due 
to the delicious uncertainty as to what we mayor may 
not meet with among the rocks and heather of the 
lonelier glens ; and I, for one, am obliged to confess 
that our national scenery exercises a stronger spell 
over mv imainnation than the beauties of Switzerland 



12 NATURAL HISJ^ORY OF THE GROUSE 

or the gloomy grandeur of the fiords of Western Nor- 
way. The grouse is pre-eminently bound up with our 
happiest memories of home scenery. Of course, the 
wealthy men among us can go to Spitzbergen and 
enjoy good sport with a form of ptarmigan which Mr. 
Abel Chapman considers to be almost identical with 
the red grouse ; or they may visit Northern Europe 
and kill willow grouse to their heart's content ; but 
the grouse holds a unique position in the affections of 
most British sportsmen ; all the more, perhaps, since 
it is essentially an insular production, and cannot be 
met with out of Great Britain and Ireland, except, 
indeed, under certain artificial conditions. 

I do not know anything of Irish moors at first 
hand, never having visited Ireland ; but the north of 
England affords as fine a race of grouse as can be 
found anywhere in the Northern kingdom. The Pen- 
nine range, especially, with its infinite number of out- 
lying spurs, affords an enormous area for grouse to 
range over, and possesses the advantage of being 
near to the metropolis. Many quiet nooks of exquisite 
beauty are to be found among the grouse moors of 
Yorkshire and of Westmoreland. Farther south, the 
grouse manages to exist in close proximity to some of 
the grimy manufacturing towns of Lancashire. The 
account of the habits of the red grouse furnished 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 13 



by Mr. Seebohm to Dresser's ' Birds of Europe ' was 
based upon his study of the species in Derbyshire. 
Farther south than this it seems useless to look for 
grouse, unless we turn aside into little Wales, which is 
not famous for the quality of bags obtained upon the 
Twelfth, though the species appears to exist in most 
suitable places in the Principality. It would be a 
mistake, however, to suppose that the grouse cannot 
thrive at a distance from the great lonely moorlands 
which constitute its natural home. I believe that the 
species could be naturalised in any part of Britain, 
provided the conditions of life proved suitable. The 
experiments that have been made in Norfolk, although 
carried out on a small scale, are full of encouragement. 
Mr. J. H. Gurney tells me that Mr. J. Hardcastle 
turned some grouse out on Holt Heath nearly twenty 
years ago, but that they have long since vanished. 
Better results have been obtained at Sandringham. 
' Some fourteen years ago,' writes Mr. Jackson, the: 
head keeper, ' thirty brace were turned down, and 
the following year another thirty brace. The experi- 
ment was not made with a view to add to the shooting, 
but for the pleasure of hearing and seeing the birds on 
the estate. I found that they nested and reared their 
young quite satisfactorily, but that they decreased in 
number between the breeding seasons a fact which 



14 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



was doubtless due to their straying off our ground. 
They have an area of about 1,200 or 1,500 acres of 
heather, which is for the most part surrounded by 
grazing land. The stock is now reduced to about 
eight or ten brace.' It must be the wish of all good 
sportsmen to see such experiments as that just de- 
scribed meet with an enlarged success. We do not 
take as much pains to improve our sport at home as 
we might. I wonder, for example, that landowners 
do not unite to turn down gadwall and other fowl all 
over the country, and thus convert our ponds and 
rivers into a national preserve of wildfowl. There are 
thousands of places that would hold a brace of teal or 
a few pairs of pintail, if only they were planted with 
large beds of rushes and well preserved. As for the 
grouse, its good qualities have begun to attract atten- 
tion among our Continental neighbours. The pioneer 
was Baron Dickson, who established red grouse in 
Sweden between twenty and thirty years ago. It is 
now reported that the Belgian Government intends to 
people the sandy heaths of that country with drafts of 
red grouse. 

Already the example of Baron Dickson has been 
emulated by Count Kniphausen, who owns a property 
in East Friesland, and has given the following account 
of his experiment : ' In the autumn of 1891 I ordered 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 15 

from a game dealer in England five pairs of live grouse 
for my game preserves near Wittmund in East Fries- 
land, as an experiment in the way of naturalising this 
foreign game bird with us. My prospects regarding 
this attempt did not appear to me unpromising, as I 
could offer the birds on my sporting domain freedom 
from disturbance, plenty of water, heather, and various 
berry-bearing plants, and patches of buckwheat, to 
all of which these birds are said to be partial. The 
grouse were transported across the North Sea in 
November. They were sent from Scotland via London 
and Flushing, the consequence of which was that, by 
reason of the long railway journeys, the birds suffered 
very much, and succumbed, chiefly, I fear, from want 
of water at any rate, I only received one pair alive 
on their arrival at their destination. I had taken pains 
beforehand to erect for them, in a thicket, an aviary 
of wire netting, with canvas overhead, provided plenti- 
fully with water and buckwheat, and with the wire 
netting stuck full of sprigs of heather, partly so that 
they might feel themselves more hidden, but chiefly 
because I understand that heather tops are their chief 
source of nourishment. After a few days' rest I had 
one of the sides of the inclosurc raised, so that the 
grouse might go out of their own accord. In the 
spring of 1893 I was rewarded by coming across the 



1 6 NATURAL HI 'STORY OF THE GROUSE 

cock grouse in the company of a blackcock on my 
preserve, and had the pleasure of listening to his call. 
It also came to my knowledge that the hen was alive, 
and that she had incubated for about fourteen days, 
though too late in the year, for it was during the 
harvesting of the buckwheat that she was disturbed 
by the mowers. The cock and hen both flew away, 
and the hen, alas ! never sought her nest again. The 
eggs, fourteen in number, I have preserved. This 
delightful discovery, that a pair of grouse had lived 
all but two years on my property, and had even made 
a good attempt to rear a brood, made me resolve to 
go on with my experiments. The dealer to whom I 
addressed myself undertook, for twenty marks the 
pair, to deliver ten brace of grouse to me ; and we 
came to an understanding that he should send them 
at my cost from Hull to Bremen, that he should 
undertake their being carefully secured in boxes made 
expressly for the purpose, and that he should not be 
bound to make good any losses that might occur. 
Messrs. Weltmann, in Hull, who forward goods for 
the North German Lloyd's Company, kindly under- 
took the delivery of them, and promised to see that 
they did not want for food or water on their thirty 
hours' sea voyage; and thus, to my joy, my gamekeeper, 
whom I had sent to Bremen to fetch the birds, was 



IN PRAISE OF THE GROUSE 17 

enabled to deliver to me the whole lot of seven brace 
(more were not to be had at the time). 

' The birds this time flew strongly when let out in 
their inclosure, but did not hurt themselves, owing 
to the canvas spread over the top. My sporting 
neighbours all belong to the Prussian and Oldenburg 
Forest and Moor Game Preservation Societies, to 
both of which I successfully applied, and they have, 
as before on the introduction of black-game, promised 
that for some years to come the protection of these 
grouse shall be looked upon by them as a strict duty. 
So it is to be hoped that this attempt to naturalise 
them in the plains of North-West Germany may suc- 
ceed, as it did with the black-game, which had for 
many a long year been extinct there.' 

And here I may remark that, as the red grouse is 
systematically netted in large numbers in the north of 
England, it should be easy enough for any of our 
Continental neighbours to repeat the experiment just 
described on a larger scale. Any such endeavour to 
naturalise the red grouse abroad should be extended 
over several seasons, and care should be taken to 
supply an adequate number of female birds. The 
latter are rather less hard}' than the opposite sex, and 
are consequently more liable to perish on the journey 
than their male companions. 



1 8 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



It has been suggested that the eggs of the grouse 
could be exported to other countries. No doubt 
Count Kniphausen might very well have tried the 
experiment of introducing grouse eggs into the nests 
of greyhens. The eggs could be obtained in York- 
shire, and carried by water to their destination without 
incurring much risk. But very few sportsmen would 
allow eggs to be lifted on their moors, and any traf- 
ficking in the eggs of game birds gives an unfortunate 
stimulus to poaching practices. On the other hand, 
live grouse might safely be sent very long distances if 
packed in roomy cages and not overcrowded. The 
tops of the cages should be lined with canvas, so that 
the birds could not injure their heads by flying up- 
wards. I remember a charming sand grouse which 
became extremely domesticated and familiar with the 
members of the household to which it belonged. It 
was fearful, however, of strangers, and when alarmed 
the poor bird almost always started upwards and 
struck the wooden roof of the cage. I mention this 
practical point, because I have found by experience 
that, obvious as it seems to be, it is in fact generally 
disregarded by those persons who send live grouse 
about the country. I feel sure that its recognition 
would materially reduce the risks of travelling. 



CHAPTER II 

THE MANNERS OF THK GROUSK 

THE anxious time for those of us who happen to 
possess moors, or even to have leased those of others, 
arrives in the spring of the year, when the grouse, that 
have long since paired off with their respective mates, 
begin to occupy their stations for the summer and to 
go to nest. Without wishing to dogmatise too nicely, 
it is fair to say that almost every bird upon the moor 
occupies its peculiar station for many successive 
years, unless, of course, interfered with by human 
agency. It has been said, for example, that if an 
ornithologist wishes to explore any district in Lap- 
land in search of the eggs of the rarer species, lie 
should spend the time of a preliminary expedition in 
marking down the precise situations which each pair 
of any one species choose to occupy. We can all of 
us see the force of this remark even at home. Season 
after season witnesses to the faithfulness with which 
the curlew and its mate return to a lons^ and desolate

strip of broken moorland lying under the shadow of 
the Coolin Hills ; the eggs are almost always laid 
about the same spot, and generation after generation 
of downy chicks enter into existence on the same 
patch of heather and rough grass. It is the same 
with the ptarmigan that nestles up in the lonely 
corrie above Sligachan. I have seen the nests of 
two seasons placed side by side on a slope of green 
turf, screened from observation by the same con- 
venient boulders of rock. Indeed, I could tell you 
where to find the nest of the greenshank and many 
another rare bird, knowing from long intimacy with 
their haunts precisely the positions that these birds 
are likely to occupy in successive seasons. This 
principle applies as truly to the red grouse as to 
other birds, making allowance for the destruction of 
old females in the shooting season. On my own 
ground, at any rate, I have a very good idea where 
to look for grouse nests, although I never search for 
them intentionally, but only 'stumble upon them inci- 
dentally. No good sportsman would wish to organise 
a hunt for grouse nests. The grouse is a very par- 
ticular bird, and often deserts her eggs if suddenly 
startled from her charge. Of course, there are many 
hen grouse which would rather allow themselves to be 
trodden upon than leave their eggs, and their faithful-

THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 



ness to maternal duties is touching in its way. But 
the grouse is naturally a shy, timid creature, and will 
not willingly brook much interference. A grouse 
moor can hardly be kept too quiet in the breeding 
season. That is the reason why proprietors object so 
strongly to the intrusion of parties of tourists being 
forced upon them by any Radical legislation. Strangers 
do not, of course, intend the least in the world to do 
us any harm, but in point of fact they are pretty cer- 
tain to scare some birds badly, and thus to diminish 
the supply of chicks hatched out. Some people may 
suggest that grouse breed so very early that the young 
are hatched long before the tourist season. The 
grouse is an early breeding bird in the north of 
England, and often begins to lay eggs during the 
month of March if the season happens to be warm 
and genial. In the north of Scotland incubation is 
much later. In the island of Skye, April 24 is a de- 
cidedly early date for a full clutch of grouse eggs. 

May and June are the two months in which the 
majority of grouse hens go to nest. Although most 
of us have accustomed ourselves to speak of grouse 
nests, the expression is hardly exact, for the eggs are 
deposited in a mere scratching, scantily lined with a 
few dry stems of grass or twigs of heather. Some of 
the text-books, it is true, speak of feathers being used 



22 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



to line the nests of grouse, but I believe that any 
feathers found in a grouse's nest have been accident- 
ally dropped by the old bird. The nest is very often 
placed near a little burn, generally under the shelter 
of a tuft of heather. I have occasionally seen per- 
fectly open nests, but they are very liable to be 
flooded. The grouse is one of the hardiest birds in 
existence, and frequently continues to sit upon her eggs 
after the nest has filled with water ; but the eggs are 
delicate, and are generally addled by such unfortunate 
immersion, notwithstanding , the devotion exhibited 
by the old hen. It is a fallacy to suppose that grouse 
like to nest in very old heather. As a matter of fact 
they prefer younger plants as cover, choosing to avail 
themselves of the shelter of well-grown but not really 
old ling. 

As to the number of eggs usually laid by grouse, 
my belief is that seven and eight are the numbers 
which occur most frequently Five is the smallest 
number that I have seen incubated, nor have I ever 
seen more than a dozen eggs in one nest. Indeed, to 
find more than ten eggs in a nest is quite an excep- 
tional event, although probably most sportsmen have 
at one time or another come across large coveys of 
young birds. It often happens, however, that one or 
more eggs prove unfertile. There are records of as 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 23 



many as seventeen eggs being found in a single grouse 
nest, but I imagine that two hen birds had laid together. 
Mr. Henry Seebohm is perhaps as high an authority 
upon the eggs of British birds as any member of the 
B.O.U. He says that he has not found much variation 
in the sixe of eggs of the grouse. 'The ground-colour 
of the eggs of the grouse is usually a pale olive, 
spotted and blotched all over with dark red-brown. 
The spots are frequently so confluent as almost to 
conceal the ground-colour. In fresh-laid eggs the 
brown is often very red, in some instances almost 
approaching crimson. It appears to darken as it 
thoroughly dries, and sometimes almost approaches 
black. When fresh laid the colour is not very fast, 
and before the eggs are hatched the beauty of the 
original colouring is generally very much lessened by 
large spots coming off altogether, no doubt from the 
friction of the feathers when the bird is sitting. If 
the weather is wet when the bird begins to sit this is 
much more the case. When the colour lias once 
become thoroughly dry il will bear washing in water 
without injury. The colour of the eggs is admirably 
adapted for the purpose of concealment from the 
prying eyes of rooks, crows, and birds of prey, being 
very much like the mixture of moss, lichens, and peat 
where they are laid. Most of the eggs laid come to 



24 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

maturity. I once asked a gamekeeper to watch half 
a dozen nests which were near his house. He told 
me that out of forty-nine eggs, he counted forty-seven 
chicken grouse. As soon as the young are hatched, 
especially in dry seasons, the hen takes her brood 
down to the more swampy parts of the moor.' It will 
be obvious to most people that the proportion of eggs 
that hatch out depends very much on the rainfall. 
Still more does this affect the tiny grouse during the 
first few days of their existence. If the weather is 
dry and sunny, the little fellows grow rapidly and soon 
become fairly independent, learning to peck at small 
caterpillars, flies, and other insects. _ If heavy showers 
of rain arrive at the critical time the number of young 
grouse that perish is often very considerable, for, hardy 
as they eventually become, they are extremely tender 
during the first days of their existence. Gradually 
the cheepers grow stronger, and learn to forage on 
their own account. They do best in fairly dry seasons, 
provided always that they have a good supply of water 
easily accessible. Should this be scarce, the chicks 
are sadly liable to seek to satisfy their thirst in deep 
ditches and drains, out of which they cannot easily 
make their escape. 

Of course it is impossible to guard against such 
misfortunes. Happily the hen grouse is a careful 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 25 



parent ; indeed, both the male and female birds take 
every care of their young broods. 

The grouse depends chiefly upon heather for its 
subsistence, feeding on the common ling (Calluna 
vulgaris] and also on the fine-leaved heath (Erica 
cinerea), breaking off the fresh tips of the twigs, which 
are reduced to pulp by the action of the gizzard, 
assisted by fine fragments of quartz and pebbles intro- 
duced for the purpose of aiding the action of the latter 
in comminuting the food. Grouse are partial to 
the berries of both the bilberry and cranberry. 
Clover leaves have also an attraction for them. 
Occasionally they eat the polypody, of which the 
pheasant is also fond. In severe weather grouse 
find that even hips help to support existence. Joseph 
Walton of Garrigill tells me that very small grouse 
feed eagerly on caterpillars, a fact which he has verified 
by dissection. 

In the fall of the year grouse often shift their 
quarters from the tops of the hills, in order to feast 
upon the stooks of oats upon the shepherd's croft or 
the minister's glebe. Some birds take very kindly to 
the stubble. In some parts of Perthshire it is quite a 
common event to find a covey of grouse haunting a 
favourite field for many successive weeks, and the 
birds grow heavy upon the diet they thus obtain, 



26 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



though they are considered rather to deteriorate in 
flavour. It is this readiness to feed upon grain which 
makes it possible to keep grouse in confinement, or at 
any rate in a state of semi-captivity. Some few years 
ago, when the sand grouse were visiting England, I was 
told one day that a sand grouse in the possession 
of a neighbour had nested and laid some eggs. On 
inquiry we found that the bird, which had nested in 
the house of its owner, was a tame red grouse, which 
had voluntarily begun to incubate. No instance of 
the grouse rearing its young in captivity has come 
under my notice hitherto, although some half-dozen 
records of the fact appear to be authenticated. The 
late Mr. Osborne, for example, kept a number of 
grouse in confinement for several years, and on one 
occasion a pair bred and hatched out five healthy 
chicks. Their owner used to walk many miles from 
Wick to fetch the tender heather shoots for the old 
and young grouse which had hatched out within his 
walls in the town. 1 

It is remarkable that so shy and retiring a bird 
as the red grouse should become extremely bold and 
adventurous under artificial conditions, yet of this 
there can be no possible doubt. Mr. W. Oxenden 
Hammond tells us of a red grouse which was taken to 
1 Fauna of Sutherland and Caithness, p. 205. 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 



Kent from a Yorkshire moor, and lived for several 
years in a cage in the hall of a country house. ' This 
was an old cock bird, and its constant call in the 
morning used to echo through the house.' ' A pleas- 
ing description of the lameness of a covey of grouse 
was contributed to the ' Field ' of February 5, 1887, by 
a correspondent who signed his article with the letter 
' X.' ' Now the history of these tame birds is as 
follows : A friend of mine one who delights in all 
matters relating to the habits of wild birds, and, what 
is more, is thoroughly versed in the subject had a 
nest of grouse eggs hatched out under a hen this on 
the same ground where his young pheasants were 
being reared. When first out of the egg the young 
grouse showed a disposition to stray somewhat too 
far from the maternal coop ; but this little difficulty 
was easily overcome by the intelligent keeper. At 
some distance a wire netting was placed round the 
coop. In a very short time this was removed ; 
but to show the result of habit and training on 
birds, it was found that the young ones circled round 
much about the place where the wire netting had 
stood. 

' Time went on, and they soon settled into the 
habits of their pheasant companions. Some six or

28 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



seven grew up, and about October the cock birds seem 
to have made advances to the hens, and their overtures 
doubtless being taken by the latter as inopportune out 
of season they modestly levanted. There remained 
three cocks, all in splendid plumage and condition, 
feeding, be it remembered, entirely on pheasants' food 
and what they could pick up about the house. One of 
the birds remained in the corner of the field where 
the coop had stood, taking possession of it for himself. 
Here at all times he was to be seen ready to dispute 
his ground with anyone passing near it. Usually he 
challenged with a call, and then, if approached, he 
was ready either for a fight or to be fed, or both any- 
thing that suited the whim of the intruder. One day, 
when I was giving some maize to my friend, the keeper 
came up, and going on all fours, began throwing grass 
in the face of the bird. At once the grouse responded 
to the challenge by flying at him, coming up sideways, 
and using his spurs. The bird allowed itself repeatedly 
to be caught, and the moment he was liberated re- 
turned again and again to the unequal combat. More 
than once have I seen this same bird fly across from 
his corner and join us when shooting on the opposite 
woodland bank, this being some 600 or 700 yards 
across a narrow neck of sea at the head of a loch. 
My friend's dogs retrievers and spaniels knew the 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 29 



bird well, and paid no attention to him, nor did he to 
the shots that were fired close to him. But not so my 
retriever. He began by thinking it was his manifest 
duty to bring the bird to me ; but, on being duly 
warned, and on seeing the grouse trying to get to close 
quarters to ram him, so to speak, with his spurs, a 
feeling of alarm, droll to see, came over the dog. 
Evidently he concluded he had to deal with some- 
thing quite new to him, possibly a demented grouse. 
Another day I fell in with my friend a mile from this 
spot, and having two dogs with me, it was as much as 
I could do to beat a hasty retreat into a thick wood, 
so anxious was he to have a sparring match with one 
or other of the dogs. 

' This bird has now taken up his quarters close to a 
house, a mile from the place he was reared, remaining 
just as tame, and coming regularly for his breakfast. 
The two others remain about the lodge, in the court- 
yard, in the garden, and frequently come in at the 
servants' dinner-time to pick up anything that may be 
thrown to them. They have induced one wild bird 
to come down off the moor, and this bird is now 
fairly tame that is to say, he will let one get within a 
few yards of him. When, by the way, it pleased 
Master Grouse to join us out shooting, if by chance a 
spaniel came suddenly upon him, he was not in the 



30 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



least degree disconcerted he would simply fly on to 
a rock, and begin crowing at the dog.' 

While the willow grouse is well known to be fond 
of perching in trees, its British congener rarely alights 
even on a bush except when forced by hunger to feed 
on hips in snowy weather. Mr. J. G. Millais gives a 
charming account of a Westmoreland grouse which 
was hatched and reared by a little bantam. ' Every 
evening the bantam used to repair to a large beech 
tree near the house, in which she was in the habit of 
roosting when unencumbered by family cares. So 
when she was allowed to remain out for the night her 
first thought was to make for her old perch, to which 
she considered the youngster was perfectly capable of 
following, as he could now fly well. The latter, after 
many ineffectual attempts to keep on his legs, was 
forced to sleep on the ground at the foot of the tree, 
for though he managed to get up to the perch, his 
efforts to keep there were quite useless, as he always 
fell off again, either backwards or forwards. How- 
ever, in the course of time practice made perfect, and 
he acquired such a liking for sitting on the trees that 
he was often afterwards seen in the daytime flying 
from branch to branch, appearing to be perfectly at 
home.' Mr. Millais adds that this grouse ' had a par- 
ticular affection for the lawn-tennis court, and when- 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 31 



ever any of the members of my friend's family began 
to play, Mr. Grouse would always put in an appear- 
ance, seeming to enjoy the fact that he was an 
obstructionist, and refusing to clear off unless forcibly 
removed and shut up in his pen. If taken to the 
other end of the grounds he would almost imme- 
diately return to the tennis court. Such was the soci- 
ability of his disposition that he had absolutely no 
sense of fear at the report of firearms ; in fact, he 
would frequently follow the shooters out to a distance 
of several fields from the house before he would 
return home, satisfied that they had taken their 
departure for the whole day, so that it would be of 
no use accompanying them. Every night, before 
retiring to roost in his beech tree, he would take long 
flights round and round the house and village, which 
was close by; and in the course of one of his evening 
rambles he espied an old man digging, from whom 
he very naturally expected he would obtain some 
delicacy, as everyone was in the habit of giving him 
something to eat ; but this old scoundrel was a 
stranger, and barbarously despatched the confiding 
bird with his spade.' ' Mr. Millais mentions another 
tame grouse, which lived for a long time at (iuisachan, 
Lord Tweedmouth's place in Koss-shire. ' After

32 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

being kept for several years, he departed as usual in 
spring to the hills, where he annually assisted in the 
increase of the stock, but did not return to the house, 
as was his wont, during the following winter. He 
feared neither man nor beast, and became great 
friends with a certain dog in the house, on whose 
back he used often to ride. The following instance 
of his plucky disposition was related to me on sepa- 
rate occasions by each of the two guns who were 
present when the affair occurred. A shooting party 
were beating the hillside near the house, when a 
pointer that was working stood to birds, which even- 
tually rose, and some were killed ; but as the dog still 
held, they correctly inferred that there was probably 
another bird left, which proved to be the case. This 
happened to be the tame grouse, whose presence was 
quite unexpected, and who considered being pointed 
such an insult that when the unfortunate dog ap- 
proached near enough to be disagreeable, he flew up 
and attacked it so blindly that he was with difficulty 
rescued from its jaws.' 

Cock grouse, in spite of their general shyness, are 
very pugnacious birds, and the old males especially 
show great intolerance of any strangers that venture 
to intrude upon what they consider their own proper 
domain. A Perthshire keeper tells me that he saw 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 33 



two male grouse engaged in combat ; so completely 
blinded with fury were the birds that they dashed 
against the wall of a stone building, one of them kill- 
ing himself with the impetuosity of his flight. 

Individuals of the male sex appear to predominate 
in most birds, and I have no doubt myself as to the 
desirability of sportsmen endeavouring to shoot the 
male birds hard. Not only do more male birds reach 
maturity, but the females are exposed to additional 
risks in the breeding season. Mr. D. J. Lamb states 
that, out of 130 grouse killed near Pitlochry in four 
days in 1893, as many as 120 were cock birds. 1 
This, of course, is an exceptional incident, but it 
points the moral that cock birds should not be 
allowed to live unpaired. Otherwise they disturb 
the breeding couples, and become a nuisance to 
the grouse moor. Of course, birds behave very 
diversely in different parts of the country. With 
us in Skye the family parties live together in peace 
and tranquillity until November, and rarely pack 
before the end of that month. If they pack in 
November it is generally in consequence of bad 
weather. On the other hand, the grouse of the 
north of England pack, as a general rule, early in 
the season, and the sexes usually separate. Every

31 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

sportsman knows that the old cock birds often lie 
out singly in the heather on the tops of the hills, 
while the females and younger males are shifting in 
flocks about the lower ground. 

I have gradually been led to the opinion that the 
custom of driving the moors has altered the habits 
of grouse enormously, and led to their becoming 
far more gregarious than they used to be. The men- 
tion of grouse driving always reminds me of a remark 
which was made in my presence some few years 
ago. A certain man was descanting rather loudly on 
the excellence of his shooting, when Sir Reginald 
Cathcart inquired whether the drives were good. The 
reply was somewhat unexpected : ' Well, the fact is, 
we have not any drives yet, but I am having them 
laid out.' Our grouse in Skye never become very 
wild. Their tameness in December is often more 
openly expressed than in the breeding season. Of 
course, nesting grouse will alldw you to tread upon 
them in the heather rather than rise from their place 
of concealment, and it is necessary to take a dog to 
the hill if you wish to form an estimate of the number 
of birds upon the moor in the month of May. A hen 
that is nesting in an open situation will generally 
dash away in trepidation if she thinks herself detected ; 
but most birds nest in cover, and greatly prefer to 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 35 



watch your movements while resting snugly concealed 
than to court your notice by any hasty action that 
might betray the safety of their treasures. Their 
habits become modified, however, when the young 
have hatched out. For example, if you happen to 
cross a bit of mossy ground on a July day you are 
sure to flush an old hen grouse, which sings out lustily 
as she rises from the heather. The dog makes a 
point, and lo ! a newly feathered youngster is crouch- 
ing at your feet, watching all your movements with 
a keen glance of its bright dark eyes. You pause for 
a moment to admire the little fellow's yellow freckled 
garb ; it harmonises nicely with the rough cover in 
which the creature is nestling. The instinct with 
which it accepts an impassive position, as offering the 
best hope of safety, is truly marvellous. The old hen 
will not leave her young ; another step forward, and 
you flush four or five more young birds, which start 
up with their plaintive cheeping cry, to fly a few 
paces across the moor before they drop back into 
cover. The anxiety of the old birds is often touching 
in its disinterestedness, especially if the young are 
newly hatched, in which case the mother birds worm 
this way and that way along the ground, trailing 
themselves through the heather with half-open wings, 
hoping by this transparent device to lead you away 



36 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

from their tender charge. Grouse are good parents, 
full of solicitude for their young, and will endure any 
danger rather than allow their chicks to be injured. 
Sometimes they succeed even in beating off the attack 
of the hooded crow, or that rascally marauder the 
female sparrow hawk. 

Grouse seem to me to thrive best upon moors of 
moderate elevation. The low-lying grounds suit them 
very well in winter, when snow and sleet have driven 
them down from the hills, and they will then fly long dis- 
tances. It is not at all unusual for red grouse to cross 
the Solway Firth at a point where the estuary measures 
two miles in breadth, and I have known them fly 
longer distances. They often cross the valley of the 
Tees, flying about a mile from one hillside to another. 
Mr. Millais observes that ' the usual length of a 
grouse's flight ranges from a quarter to three-quarters 
of a mile, depending entirely, of course, on the nature 
of the ground over which they are passing, being as a 
rule much shorter on heather flats, where they have- 
numerous and agreeable resting places, than on broken 
ground and rocky hill places. In a discussion which 
took place in the " Field " I noticed that most sports- 
men were of opinion that grouse were incapable of 
flying four miles ; but I have twice seen grouse on the 
wing when they were crossing the " Bring," a wide 



37 



channel which separates the islands of Hoy and 
Pomona, Orkneys. The fishermen told me this 
distance, at the point where I was sailing, was quite 
four miles across, and the birds must have come at 
least another mile on the Pomona side from the point 
where they left the moor.' 

Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown states that in December 
1879 a pack of grouse was seen flying south over 
the Moray Firth, making for the Banff coast. Their 
journey must have been very considerable. It is not 
easy, in fact, to say how far the grouse is migratory, 
but that individual birds wander far and wide in 
autumn and winter there can be no doubt. The Rev. 
M. A. Mathew records that a solitary red grouse 
was shot by Mr. C. Edwards on the Mendips, near 
Wrington, Somerset, in September 1885, and this, he 
suggests, must have crossed over the Bristol Channel, 
migrating from Breconshire. Very likely the bird was 
pursued by a peregrine, and the chase carried it far 
out of its usual latitude. Similarly, the red grouse 
included in Mr. Miller Christy's ' Birds of Essex ' had 
no doubt strayed from Sandringham, or from some 
other centre of introduction in Eastern England In 
1879 Mr. W. Stamper observed a pair of grouse in a 
turnip field on his farm near Oswaldkirk, Yorks, early 
in February. The birds had strayed at least ten miles 



38 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

from the nearest grouse moor. Severe weather often 
affects the interests of the grouse bred on high ground. 
Thus, Mr. James Carter writes that in January 1886 
the neighbourhood of Masham, Yorkshire, was covered 
to a considerable depth with snow, which, owing to 
sudden changes from thaw to frost, with frequent 
fresh falls of snow, became a very solid mass. The 
depth above the heather on the moors was consider- 
ably more than a foot, and large drifts formed on a 
very extensive scale. 'The grouse suffered severely, 
being quite unable to penetrate the frozen mass for 
food, and in consequence they left the moors for the 
lower cultivated land to an extent never previously 
observed. The nearest point of moor to Masham is 
three miles distant, but the open moors are considerably 
farther away. Walking near this ground, great packs 
of grouse would sweep overhead and pass right down 
the valley over the town. A field of turnips was 
swarming with the starving birds, which vainly at- 
tempted, with numerous partridges, to scratch down 
for food. The grouse were perched on the fences, 
feeding on the berries like so many fieldfares, and on 
several occasions they alighted amongst the branches 
of trees. They were feeding in the hedgerows about 
Durton House and close to the outskirts of the town, 
and even on the heaps of manure close to buildings 



THE MANNERS OF THE GROUSE 39 

where persons were working all day. As far as one 
could see they had abandoned the moors, and were 
feeding miles away in the cultivated districts on any- 
thing they could get in the way of food. A large 
farmer, whose land lies three miles still farther away 
from their usual haunts, states that immense flocks of 
grouse were feeding in his turnip fields. Gangs of 
men were being employed to clear away the snow from 
patches of heather, but their efforts did very little 
towards providing feeding ground for the vast number 
of starving birds.' 1 The Editor of the 'Zoologist' 
appended to the communication just cited a note that, 
' About the time mentioned there was an extraordinary 
exodus of grouse from the moors in the neighbourhood 
of Ilkley, in consequence of the very inclement 
weather. The birds in many cases left the moorland 
altogether, and large packs were seen in the fields 
about Arthington and Weedon. ... I )uring a severe 
winter some years ago we remember to have heard 
that in Caithness the grouse were all down on the sea- 
shore, and hardly a bird was to be found on the 
moors.' A large amount of similar evidence might 
be cited if it could serve any useful purpose, but the 
foregoing will suffice to show that not only do single 
pairs of grouse stray occasionally on to arable ianns,

40 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

but that under certain conditions the majority of 
English grouse desert their favourite moors for a short 
period in order to satisfy the pangs of hunger. The 
question whether grouse are liable to migrate in 
the early spring, when food is apparently plentiful, 
suggests a more difficult problem. There are good 
sportsmen, at any rate, and careful field naturalists 
who incline to believe that the grouse, like its distant 
relative Pallas's sand grouse, is occasionally seized 
by paroxysms of migratory fever, under the influence 
of which the birds travel for many miles from their 
home moor. But positive proof that this is so is 
still wanting, and the question can only be settled 
by means of marked birds. 



CHAPTER III 

THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 

THE most important factor in grouse preserving is a 
judicious treatment of the heather which clothes the 
slopes of our northern hills. Of course many other 
points have to be considered. If we allow the moors 
to become overstocked, we increase the susceptibility 
of the game to the various forms of disease which 
have been so cleverly exploited by Dr. Klein and 
other scientific workers. But the vital question in 
the management of a grouse moor is the maintenance 
of a proper food supply. Grouse are hard}' fowl, 
and can face wet seasons, not indeed with impunity, 
yet without seriously losing ground. They are well 
accustomed to meet the vicissitudes of our stormy 
and changeable climate. In droughty seasons they 
vary their diet with an additional share of blaeberries. 
Does the snow fall swiftly and thickly on the brae? 
the grouse have long since learnt full well by experi- 
ence of hard times how to find the gullies where the 



42 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

snow will drift in eddies before the gusts of wind that 
drive with such precipitancy, and are sure to assemble 
in the places where they can get the best supply of 
food. If necessary, they can scratch off the snow that 
shrouds the food plant from their vision. But how if 
we neglect the culture of the food plant ? In that 
case our grouse must fail. Shepherds have done 
much to change the appearance of our Highland glens, 
and to bring about a complete metamorphosis in the 
conditions under which grouse live in many districts. 
An enormous increase in the number of sheep kept 
in Great Britain has destroyed, and is still destroying, 
a vast quantity of heather. This is all right up to a 
certain point. Vermin like old heather, but grouse 
do not. Young heather is very acceptable to grouse 
as a variety. But the practice of burning great 
stretches of heather, instead of firing the ling in care- 
fully selected strips, is much to be regretted. Of 
course accidents will occur from time to time. No 
amount of care will prevent a few sparks from a passing 
locomotive firing a dry moss in a rainless season, any 
more than it would prevent our grouse being felled 
by a wire fence or by the telegraph wires newly erected 
upon some spot where grouse often cross the hill. 
But pains can be taken to see that heather is burnt 
by the shepherds in such a way as to meet the require- 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 43 



ments of each hursel of sheep, while respecting the 
rights and interests of the prince of game birds. 
Shepherds, however good and reasonable they may 
be in other respects, like to delay the burning of 
heather until the latest legal date. They have their 
reasons for their choice. They do not care to fire the 
heather until it is very dry, for this reason, that if the 
stems of the heather are green they will not burn well, 
but will become hard and sharp, and the sheep will 
not willingly feed among it. The drawback to post- 
poning the burning of the heather is the fact that the 
grouse is an early breeder, and that late fires are likely 
to disturb breeding birds, and to drive them away 
from their nests. So the first point in keeping up 
a good supply of grouse is to secure a clever and 
thoughtful management of the heather. 

The next point is to supplement a good supply of 
food for the grouse by waging war against its four- 
footed and winged persecutors. The modern game 
preserver has often a genuine sympathy for the wild 
creatures that are roughly classed together as 'vermin.' 
It would be a grievous sin, undoubtedly, to extirpate 
even ' vermin 'altogether. People who have no game 
of their own to preserve are sometimes templed to say 
hard things of those who have, because they kill out 
hawks and other high-spirited creatures. Neverthe- 



44 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

less, there is a mean to be attained in game preserving 
as in all other things. Landowners exercise good 
sense and decency if they tolerate a little ' vermin,' 
both to gratify their own taste and to satisfy the 
requirements of an interested public. But if they 
allow their lands to swarm with ' vermin ' entirely un- 
checked, they injure their neighbours and show a 
want of propriety. 

' Vermin ' should not be extirpated root and 
branch, but common sense requires that they should 
be kept within reasonable numerical limits. In the 
British Islands the birds of prey have become sadly 
reduced in numbers of late years. Collectors of 
blown egg shells a very undesirable class of men 
offer fancy prices for the eggs of the honey buzzard 
and hobby ; so that, if these species try to nest in 
their old haunts, say in the New Forest, they are 
ruthlessly pillaged and plundered without mercy. A 
love of daring induces a good many young fellows to 
storm the nests of the peregrines that nestle on the 
most precipitous portions of our coasts. The eggs 
are so handsome that they really constitute a pleasant 
memento of a hazardous venture, while the young are 
charming pets, and can be trained for the noble sport 
of falconry. 

In many parts of Scotland, and, alas ! everywhere 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 45 



in England, the man who manages to slay an un- 
fortunate eagle of either species is sure to find his 
doughty deed duly advertised by the production of a 
spicy article which goes the round of the papers, 
usually converting a sea eagle from Northern Europe 
into a magnificent golden eagle from the wilds of 
Sutherland. The most amusing instance of the kind 
that has come directly under my notice related to the 
supposed capture of a great eagle-owl in Cumberland. 
A local newspaper gave a high-flown account of how 
the huge bird was winged by a keeper on a moor near 
Cockermouth, and was brought to bay by the intrepid 
exertions of a large retriever dog. I journeyed some 
sixty odd miles to pay my respects to the bird of wis- 
dom, and was not a little entertained to find Bubo 
maximus resolve itself into a forlorn and miserable 
specimen of the short-eared owl. In this case there 
was no doubt as to where the blame of floating a 
canard lay. The editor of a local paper, Mr. Blank 
of Blankington, had seen the bird himself at the 
keeper's house, and the identification of the specimen 
as an eagle-owl was a flight of his own unassisted 
genius. Of course this brilliant hit was copied by 
many of his brethren all over England, and occupied 
a prominent position in some of the more foolish 
journals. 



46 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



In point of fact, the golden eagle does prey to some 
extent on grouse. It likes blue hares better than 
any other diet. Rabbits are acceptable ; so also is 
venison, or hill mutton for the matter of that. But it 
kills a few grouse occasionally. Golden eagles have 
always been respected on our own ground. I am too 
pleased to see them about to grudge them a few 
grouse ; but they prefer the blue hare, which can be 
spared more conveniently. 

A former tenant of Rum assured me that a pair of 
eagles which nested on a certain precipice in that 
island killed a good many grouse, in the absence 
of the blue hares and rabbits which they would have 
chosen. Happening to be a gentleman, he respected 
the safety of the birds, which belonged to the golden 
species. An outsider might have proved less magnani- 
mous. The sea eagle has become so rare in Britain 
that it would be little less than a crime for anyone to 
raid its eyry or to slay a member of its race. Alas ! 
that the hand of the destroyer was stayed so late. I 
could say a good deal about the way in which the 
sea eagles of Skye were exterminated, on a proper 
opportunity. 

The sea eagle has no objection to grouse, and is 
sure to pick off a winged bird. A neighbour of ours 
at one time kept a pair of sea eagles. They enjoyed 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 47 

their liberty, and used to love to accompany their 
master when he went to the hill, swooping down upon 
the birds he shot with great rapidity and unerring 
accuracy of aim. The kite, like the sea eagle, has 
almost been ' improved away ' from our midst. I for 
one am heartily sorry that it has become rare. Those 
that I studied in Spain appeared to live chiefly on 
offal and small reptiles. But I do not believe the 
kite is constant to any one diet. In this district the 
common buzzard feeds upon field voles, because they 
abound and other prey is scarce. In another district, 
not twenty miles away from the first, the buzzards 
live chiefly upon wall lizards. If you open them, you 
find their stomachs crammed with these reptiles, 
which you would have fancied were too swift and 
agile to be captured by so clumsy a round-winged 
hawk as the common buzzard. It is the same with 
the kite. In Germany I have seen it trying to annex 
tiny partridges. In some parts of Scotland, grouse 
found an inveterate foe in the beautiful, high-circling 
glede or red kite. The term ' glede,' by the way, is 
often applied to the buzzard and hen-harrier. But 
let that pass. The late Mr. 1C. T. Booth was a 
singularly impartial and truth-loving investigator. 
He studied the habits of the kite to good purpose 
in a remote part of Perthshire. The result of 



48 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

his researches proved that the kites under observa- 
tion fed upon squirrels and rabbits, as well as upon 
peewits, and the young of curlew, wild duck, and 
pigeons ; but he decided that grouse ' seemed to 
be their favourite food.' One kite's nest, in parti- 
cular, was visited on several occasions, and each 
time 'the young bird had a fresh-killed grouse on 
the nest.' Further, he goes on to state that he 
counted the remains of over thirty grouse under the 
branches of a large fir. ' Some were only bleached 
and weather-beaten skeletons, and probably had lain 
for many months.' He considered that all the birds 
in question had been destroyed by a single pair of 
kites at the beginning of the season. I fancy that the 
offenders would have preferred more ignoble prey if 
it had been forthcoming. Sorry should I be to do 
any injury to a British kite. But our personal 
feelings must not be allowed to overpower our better 
judgment, and the preservation of rapacious birds, 
however desirable from a scientific or philosophical 
standpoint, possesses some distinct drawbacks for 
game-preservers. The male hen-harrier is a lovely 
bird in his delicate blue garb, and I know no more 
beautiful sight in nature than a hen-harrier quartering 
a moor, as I have seen it do in North Uist and other 
places. But there cannot be any doubt that both 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 49 



male and female harriers are both extremely destruc- 
tive to grouse, and relentless in their pursuit. I do 
not justify the extermination which is so rapidly over- 
taking this bird, in consequence of its nesting on the 
ground, and being easily trapped beside its young, for 
it is a devoted parent. I do not go so far as to say 
that it feeds principally on grouse ; but I have no 
doubt that the presence of this charming harrier is 
highly inimical to the interests of both grouse and 
partridges. The peregrine falcon kills a good many 
grouse on some inland moors, but a long study of its 
habits has convinced me that it feeds on many other 
birds in a larger degree. I believe it prefers puffins 
and other sea fowl to grouse. Of course I admit also 
that this falcon kills grouse at every period of the 
year. livery sportsman knows the truth of this 
remark. It is not as well known that the peregrine 
feeds also on small birds. Young 'red' falcons are 
very destructive to young grouse, but they are not very 
discriminating, and live largely on thrushes and other 
small birds. 1 once crept within a yard or two of a 
beautiful peregrine, as he was perching on a crag of 
rock a thousand feet above the boiling waters of the 
Minch. He was so busily engaged in dissecting a 
fresh-killed skylark that he never observed my stealthy 
approach to his stronghold. It has often been said 



co NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



that the peregrine picks off the weakliest bird of a 
covey. The statement is not, however, supported by 
my experience, neither is it in keeping with what we 
know of the peregrine's character. The fact is, that a 
high-couraged bird like the falcon disdains to strike 
an unworthy quarry. She prefers a good chase. A 
Highland deer-stalker expressed the true view of the 
case with the naive remark, that ' the falcon is a real 
sportsman ! ' So she certainly is, and as such she 
has no stomach for flying sickly grouse. It is my 
belief that the peregrine, if she selects at all, selects 
the gamest bird in a covey, and the better the flight 
afforded by her victim, the keener is the falcon's 
enjoyment of the sport. 

I am no advocate for exterminating peregrines. 
On the contrary, I have taken some trouble to afford 
them protection in the breeding season ; but we can- 
not expect everybody to see the falcon in a favourable 
light. One of my friends dissected six peregrines in 
a spring, all old birds. Five of them had been feed- 
ing on grouse, the sixth had eaten a wild duck. Of 
course this did not prove much. The birds were 
cmite as likely to have contained rock doves or puffins. 
But the grouse has a strong and vigilant enemy in the 
falcon, and all that can reasonably be expected of the 
owners of grouse moors is that they will tolerate the 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 51 

peregrine without allowing it to increase locally. The 
trapping of peregrines is easily accomplished when 
the falcons nest in the face of the sea cliff. Such 
birds as breed in high rocks in the interior of the 
country have a better chance of defying the exertions 
of keepers. Whether the buzzard ever kills grouse, I 
cannot say. I incline to think that it would readily 
kill a weakly or 'pricked' bird ; but I do not think a 
buzzard cares much about grouse if field mice and 
carrion are plentiful. The rough-legged buzzard is a 
finer bird, and more likely to kill grouse. I have 
known of two gerfalcons that were in pursuit of grouse 
when killed. They share the fancy of the peregrine 
for the flesh of that persecuted bird the Cornish 
chough. 

The sparrow hawk is common in many of the 
wooded parts of Scotland adjacent to grouse moors, 
and does some mischief in spite of its small size. A 
female sparrow hawk occasionally cuts down a full- 
grown grouse ; while the male, light as he is, has suffi- 
cient audacity to seize a winged grouse. Neither 
the kestrel nor the bonnie little merlin causes the 
grouse much sorrow. They may carry off the chicks 
when a day or two old, but only, I fancy, in very rare 
instances. I have preserved our breeding merlins 
for a dozen years, finding that they rear their brood 



52 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

almost exclusively upon wheatears, meadow pipits, 
and other unimportant little birds. Once only in all 
my experience did I find the foot of a grouse chick 
in the nest of a merlin. I wish that the poor hen- 
harrier could be held equally blameless. 

To summarise my own experience of birds of 
prey, I venture to say that, so far as they act merely 
as ' nature's police,' their presence on the grouse moor 
has at least its redeeming features. Our grouse are 
all the stronger and hardier for having to struggle 
hard to maintain their existence. The thoughtless 
persecution of birds of prey, or of any other feathered 
fowl, is culpable in the extreme. But the interests of 
the sportsman and of the naturalist are closely allied, 
and the one ought to help the other in the wise 
management of the grouse moor. 

Proceeding now to speak of the less noble enemies 
which thin the ranks of our coveys directly or indirectly, 
I own to a considerable distrust of the raven. Cer- 
tainly he feeds chiefly on carrion, but I am afraid he 
is fond of grouse eggs, and sucks their contents when- 
ever a chance presents itself. So my endeavour is to 
keep the numbers of the raven down, without, how- 
ever, threatening their local extinction. The worst, 
because most cunning, foes of the grouse are the 
carrion and hooded crows. They are the worst of 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 53 

' vermin ; ' there can be no two opinions about that. 
In Norway, I know, the hooded crow is pretty omni- 
vorous. So he is in Scotland, out of the breeding 
time. In winter he will eat corn, or kill field voles, 
or gorge himself on stinking fish on the seashores 
But the black and hooded crows are dire enemies of 
sitting grouse. They carry the eggs away to the rock, 
near their nest, and the amount of mischief they do is 
incalculable. An acquaintance of mine saw three 
' hoodies ' attack a young grouse. He was a fine 
bird, and could fly a little, but he could not withstand 
the attack of three of the black rascals. A few sharp 
blows upon the back of the head soon disabled him, 
and placed him at the disposal of his cowardly assail- 
ants. There is no worse pest in Scotland than the 
hooded crow. The carrion crow is as mischievous, 
but its visits to the grouse's home are more irregular. 
Much as I dislike the use of poison, I think it should 
be employed in the extermination of hooded crows, 
provided only that the eggs which have been 
' doctored ' with strychnine be placed in a forked 
branch, or in a crag of the rocks to which no four- 
footed animal is likely to penetrate. The careless use 
of poison almost amounts to criminality. Only a few 
years ago, a fine golden eagle was killed by poison in 
a curious way. A neighbouring keeper had prepared 



54 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

some rats with strychnine and put them out on the 
hill as a bait for hooded crows. Unhappily, the male 
of a pair of golden eagles, then breeding in the locality, 
chanced to swallow one of the defunct rats, and 
perished miserably, to our eternal regret. 

Some individual rooks are most persistent in 
harrying grouse nests, and owners of rookeries ought 
in my opinion to be held legally bound to shoot their 
rookeries every season ; for these voracious birds are 
long-lived, and if too numerous in a district, they do 
harm in a variety of ways that the general public never 
dream of. 

Whether jackdaws are generally mischievous on 
a moor I cannot say, but I know that in a dry 
season they rob many grouse nests, and I think they 
should be treated as vermin, and shot if possible at 
sight whenever they appear on the hill. Richardson's 
skuas are sometimes shot as destructive to grouse. 
They would no doubt bolt a tiny grouse if they felt 
hungry, and a chance offered itself ; but that is not a 
contingency which happens frequently. The black- 
backed gulls are very destructive to young birds of 
every kind, especially the lesser variety. I do not 
think the great black-backed gull troubles much 
about grouse. He cares more for fish and for car- 
rion. But the lesser black-backed gull is a shame- 



THE GROUSE AND ITS ENEMIES 



55 



less gourmand, and does a great amount of mischief. 
He likes the young wild ducks better than the tiny 
grouse, but nothing seems to come amiss to his 
hungry maw. It occasionally happens that an old 
herring gull takes to felonious practices. They suck 
poisoned eggs eagerly, and I have seen individual 
birds beating the hill day after day searching for 
grouse nests. I have also known the herring gull to 
carry off young chickens from a cottage door. But 
the grouse suffers more from hooded crows than from 
gulls or any other of its natural enemies. Cats that 
have run wild, collies that are badly fed, these, with 
foxes and stoats, are the worst furred foes that the 
grouse has to dread. In the Highlands we kill out 
the foxes, at least so far as is possible. It is very 
necessary to keep them down, for they would com- 
mit sad havoc among the lambs if allowed to become 
numerous. 

It may be said in conclusion that the grouse has 
fewer enemies to fear than formerly. The marten 
cat and wild cat anciently took their toll of moor 
fowl, but their presence: has been banished from most 
of the haunts of the red grouse. 



56 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER IV 

THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 

CONSIDERABLE interest attaches to the plumage of the 
grouse, and most sportsmen have had occasion to 
remark upon the great variability of both sexes. This 
would not apply to the chicks, which are at first 
clothed in fine down, greyish yellow in ground colour, 
prettily variegated with chestnut and dark-brown 
markings. Nor does it apply either to the birds in first 
feather. 'At first the upper parts are brownish black, 
each feather edged and barred with yellow,' says Mac- 
gillivray, and a young bird in my hand agrees with 
this description, though some of the edgings to the 
feathers are pale chestnut rather than yellow, and the 
extremities of the feathers of the interscapular region 
are spotted with buffy white ; the lower parts are 
yellowish grey barred with pale reddish yellow. From 
this condition the birds pass gradually into the chief 
stages of adult plumage, which have been very cleverly 
worked out by Mr. J. G. Millais, who possesses a 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 57 



large number of skins of the Scotch grouse. Both 
male and female grouse are liable to leucotism, or, in 
other words, to exhibit a tendency to assume white or 
light-coloured plumage. The male grouse have two 
dominant types of plumage, the red and the black. 
The females have three principal plumages : the black, 
the spotted and the yellow. The red is found, ac- 
cording to Mr. Millais, principally in Ireland and the 
Outer Hebrides. He finds little difference in Irish 
birds whether they be killed on the swampy ground 
of the north and south or upon the high mountains 
of Mayo, Connemara and Donegal. 

The black form ' is the most unusual of the three 
types, and one which is very rarely developed to any 
degree of purity. It is more often to be found mixed 
with the red or the white type, but most commonly 
with both. When combined with these two forms, it 
is the one most commonly met with by the sportsman 
during winter, and five old cocks out of six, shot 
at that season, will be found to be of this type.' 

As for the females, Mr. Millais decides that the 
red type is the rarest, and the spotted and breeding 
dress birds are the most beautiful. ' The females of 
the red Irish bird arc yellow, and not red, as would 
be supposed ; they arc, however, quite different from 
what are generally known among Yorkshiremen as 



58 NATURAL HtSTORY OF THE GROUSE 



" yellow hens," which latter are finer in the markings 
of the feathers, and lack the boldness of the lines 
found in the Irish bird.' Mr. Millais points out that 
grouse will be found in full moult in April, August 
and October, but they change plumage gradually 
all through the year. From the month of May 
the plumage of both sexes passes through all the 
changes mentioned in the case of the ptarmigan, 
and every fresh month brings its alteration of 
feathers, either by moulting, discoloration, or both, 
till by November the bird stands clothed in its winter 
dress, that shows the type completed in one form or 
another. Young birds of the year are easily distin- 
guished till the month of September, but by Novem- 
ber it is impossible to see any difference between 
them and the old birds. Many men who have spent 
the best part of their lives on the moors will assure 
you that grouse vary in colour according to the ground 
they frequent, just as others feel convinced that they 
find certain types of colour in certain counties. Thus 
they hold that what they call ' stone-bred grouse ' are 
reared in rocky places, and that their plumage is 
barred rather than spotted, and of a generally greyer 
tone of colour than is elsewhere met with. I cannot 
say that I personally place much faith in such asser- 
tions, believing that birds vary almost indefinitely even 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GROUSE 59 

on moors in a single county. As regards the white 
type, though Mr. Millais distinguishes it as a separate 
phase, I do not see how it is to be separated from 
leucotism. Albinism i.e. the correlation of white 
plumage andpink irides isanother question altogether. 
Albino birds have often been obtained, but I have 
never yet come across an albino grouse, though I have 
heard of several white ones. Hut the white type of 
plumage seems to be akin to leucotism, and I hardly 
see how we can separate the two things. Many 
grouse have the lower parts beautifully frosted with 
white in winter. Sometimes white feathers appear 
among those of the back. Not rarely do white 
feathers crop out on the throat and breast. Birds 
which have the flight feathers of the wings partially 
or entirely white are obtained both in England and 
Scotland from time to time. 1 More decided varieties 
occur in which the ground colour of the plumage is 
huffish or greyish-white or pale silvery, varied with 
the usual characteristic markings in a subdued form. 
Such birds have been obtained in Ireland, England 
and Scotland. Mr. Millais considers that they arc 

1 I should feel very grateful to any reader who would send 
us a white variety of the grouse for the Carlisle Museum at any 
future time. Such a gift would, of course, be cased with the 
donor's name attached to it, and should be addressed to myself, 
or to The Curator, The Museum, Carlisle. 



60 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

most liable to occur at a high altitude in the north of 
Scotland. It may very well be so. Most of those 
that I have heard of myself were killed in the north 
of England at a very moderate elevation above sea- 
level. That such varieties are rare there can be no 
doubt, but they are not always preserved, even when 
procured. These pied and so-called white grouse are 
often bred from ordinary parents. On the other hand, 
when the sport has once cropped up, it is liable to be 
perpetuated, if the first pied or light-coloured birds 
are spared. Last season (1893) a hen grouse was 
shot near Alston in curious plumage. The wings were 
cream-coloured, and the body feathers were of a dirty- 
white. Three of her young birds were pied with 
white ; the other four birds of the covey were ordinary 
grouse. A few springs ago a Skiddaw shepherd sent 
me word that a white grouse was sitting on eggs upon 
the farm at which he worked. Unfortunately I was 
not able to go and see the bird. I have often thought 
of introducing the willow grouse to my own moor, in 
the hope that it might interbreed with the red grouse. 
These two species appear to be descended from one 
common ancestor. The young of the willow grouse 
bears a close resemblance to the young red grouse in 
first feather. The willow grouse has an enormously 
wide range ; it is, in fact, almost circumpolar, being 



THE PLUMAGE OF THE GXOUSE 61 

found in the northern parts of both the old and the 
new worlds. Its flight and note are those of the red 
grouse ; but, in addition to having acquired a permanent 
plumage of the white type, it has learnt also to perch 
in trees, an accomplishment to which the red grouse 
has not yet taken kindly. Possibly the red grouse is 
an insular form of the willow grouse, which still puts 
on many white feathers in some parts of its Western 
home. This knotty point, unfortunately, we cannot 
decide satisfactorily. The red grouse is monogamous 
and consorts only with its own kind. There arc- 
nevertheless a few well-authenticated specimens of the 
wild cross between the red grouse and black-game, 
as there are also perfectly black examples of the red 
, grouse. As long ago as 1836, Mr. Macgillivray 
examined and dissected a hybrid of tin's cross. 
Altogether lie examined three specimens which showed 
the characters of both the species from which they 
were derived, and furnished the following description 
of a male specimen : 'In form and proportion it is 
similar to a female black grouse. The bill is of the 
same form as in that bird. The supraocular mem- 
brane resembles that of the red grouse, having a thin 
free fringed margin, which is not the case with that ot 
the blackcock. The feathers are generally oblong, 
broadly rounded, and have a large tufty tumule. The 



62 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

tail is complete, slightly forked as in the female black 
grouse, but of only sixteen feathers, as in the red 
grouse. The quills are twenty-six. The tarsi are 
feathered all round, without a bare space behind. 
The toes are also feathered a third down, as are the 
interdigital membranes, and the plumage of these 
parts is as bushy as in the red grouse. They are 
margined with pectiniform scales, as in the black 
grouse. The claws are very long, arched, with thin 
parallel edges, like those of the red grouse and grey 
ptarmigan.' l 

The bird just described, which we may con- 
sider the type of this variety of hybrid, had the upper 
parts generally minutely undulated with brownish 
black and brownish red, with very narrow terminal 
bands of white. The upper part of the head was 
minutely mottled with brownish red, brownish black, 
and grey, but the rest of the neck was black, with a 
tinge of reddish purple. The primaries were greyish 
brown. The tail was black, the eight middle feathers 
narrowly tipped with white. On the lower parts the 
feathers were black, tipped with white, those of the 
sides being banded with red. The only hybrid be- 
tween the red grouse and black-game that has hitherto 
been obtained in England is a fine male preserved

in the collection of T. H. Horrocks, Esq., of Eden 
Brows, Carlisle. Several specimens have been met 
with in Scotland, and a single hybrid of this kind has 
lately been obtained in Wales. I have heard of two 
other birds referred to this species, but in neither in- 
stance was the bird preserved, the reason being that 
they were hard shot. This is a misfortune, for the two 
species interbreed so very rarely that all specimens of 
their hybrid offspring possess great interest for natu- 
ralists. There is reason to think that a more extra- 
ordinary hybrid than that just named occasionally 
occurs, viz. the offspring of the red grouse and partridge 
Mr. Howard Saunders has devoted the following re- 
marks to an accredited hybrid : ' Hybrids between 
the partridge and any other species are uncommon, 
but Mr. Y. Bond has a bird shot on Blubber-house 
Moor, near Harrogate, in August 1866, by the present 
Lord Walsingham, which appears to be the result of 
a cross with the red grouse, the bill being strong and 
grouse-like, the tarsi and feet partially feathered, the 
breast and body mottled with pale reddish-brown with 
a sprinkling of grey, the quill feathers dirty white, with 
lavender-grey outer webs. The brown colour of the 
upper parts is not very significant, but the feathering 
of the tarsi and feet seems tolerably conclusive.' ' 

1 Yarrell, J>riii>k />'/;-</,-, iii. i 14. 



64 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

The feathering of the tarsi does not satisfy my 
mind about the bird ; for this reason, that I have 
grounds for believing that common partridges are liable 
to be ' feather-legged.' A Crossfell keeper assured me 
that he had shot partridges with feathered legs, and 
referred me to a shepherd whom we met on Crossfell. 
When I asked that worthy whether he had seen any 
' fell partridges,' he asked at once, ' Do you mean 
the rough-legged ones ? ' adding that he knew them 
well. Mr. J. G. Millais states that two hybrids between 
the red grouse and partridge have been obtained in 
Scotland, but he has not been able to describe these 
interesting specimens. It seems perfectly possible 
that the red grouse may interbreed with its ally the 
ptarmigan, but upon this point no conclusive evidence 
is at present available. One other point at least re- 
mains to be noticed, and that is the weight of grouse. 
The cock birds not infrequently weigh 28 or 28^ 
ounces in the North of England, when in first-rate 
condition in every respect. Anything over 30 ounces 
is noteworthy, but a weight of 32 ounces is not unpre- 
cedented. 



CHAPTER V 

GROUSE- BECKING 

THE capture of wild birds has always exercised the 
resources of human ingenuity from time immemorial. 
The ancient Egyptians were masters of the art of fowl- 
ing, and some of their methods still survive. I shall 
presently speak of certain methods of poaching red 
grouse ; but I propose to treat first of the dubious but 
not necessarily illegal pastime known throughout the 
breadth of the North of England as grouse-becking, 
or becking for grouse. Those writers who have 
hitherto essayed to write about the natural history 
of grouse seem to ignore one important feature in 
their habits. Exception must be made of Mr. 
H. E. Dresser, who published the following note by 
Mr. Alston in the ' Birds of Europe ' : ' Early on 
frosty mornings, the cocks are fond of perching on a 
"know" or hillock, and uttering their clear-ringing 
" Er-~eckkek--kek! wuk, wiik wuk" At such 
times they may often be seen to rise perpendicularly 

F 



66 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

in the air to a height of several feet, and then drop 
again on the same spot.' This brief remark supplies 
the key to the sport of 'becking.' When grouse go 
to roost late on in the afternoon, they do not huddle 
together like .partridges, but scatter over the ground 
on which they intend to sleep, at the same time taking 
care to keep but a little distance apart. When the 
old male wakes in the morning, his first thought is to 
find his mate and sport with her during the early 
hours that precede the rising of the sun. Accordingly, 
rising on the wing, the male grouse begins to in- 
dulge in short, playful flights towards the object of 
his attentions. Rising quietly off the ground, the bird 
flies up to a height of fifteen or twenty feet above the 
ground. He then commences to drop again, and 
simultaneously utters his cry, ' err beck, beck, beck, 
beck, goback, goback, goback] the latter portion of his 
cry being concluded as he alights upon a tussock of 
heather or some other natural prominence. The 
female responds to the overtures of her mate, and he 
continues to repeat his amorous performance until the 
arrival of daylight suspends his erotic demonstrations. 
The North-countryman who desires to go ' becking ' 
takes the trouble to ascertain in advance where the 
birds are most likely to be met with in his neighbour- 
hood. He rises from his bed in the dead of the 



GROUSE-BECKING 67 



night, fills his pockets or belt with cartridges, and 
sallies forth through the darkness to the spot in which 
he intends to obtain sport. Arrived at the right place, 
which is generally quite in the centre of the bleak 
moorlands, and often miles from any human habita- 
tion, the fowler takes up his position behind the best 
screen that offers itself. The angle of two stone walls 
often serves as a temporary shelter, or he may hide 
himself beside a pile of peats that are drying in the 
wind. He has to remain perfectly still and silent, no 
matter how cold the job may be, for any demonstra- 
tion of impatience would surely spoil his chances of 
success. As soon as ever he hears a cock grouse start 
to call, his own business begins. His task in the first 
instance is simply to reproduce as nearly as he can 
the call of the hen grouse, which is not easy to in- 
scribe upon paper, but may perhaps be rendered ' yap, 
yapi yap, yap] or l youe, youe, youe. J 

The cry of the hen is reproduced in several ways. I 
know a Cumbrian peasant who despises the assistance of 
any instrument in ' becking.' He contrives to imitate 
the cry of the female grouse by compressing the 
nostrils with one hand and drawing in his breath, which 
is then emitted in deep gasps. This he has practised 
for years, and he can call male grouse up to his cottage 
door most successfully. Some men use a metal bird- 



68 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



call, others a bramble stem which has been hollowed 
out with a red-hot wire. The majority of those who 
go out ' becking ' carry with them the stem of a clay 
pipe, and use this as their call. It does not matter, 
in fact, how the sound is reproduced, provided it be 
communicated in a soft key and bear a close resem- 
blance to the cry of the bird. Long and unwearied 
practice in calling is the chief requisite for successful 
grouse-becking, coupled with a quick and accurate ear 
for sound. I have met with one or two men who can call 
hen grouse almost as easily as cocks, but no one cares 
to shoot the female birds. The strategy of the fowler, 
then, is very simple. He has to call the cock grouse 
up to him as to a supposed female. The bird that has 
begun to answer him flies up and alights upon a tussock 
of moss or other prominence in order to take his 
bearings of the female companion which he wishes to 
join ; the fowler calls the grouse at short intervals until 
the bird arrives within shot. He then shoots him, if 
he can, in the dim uncertain light which precedes the 
arrival of the dawn. When the day breaks the grouse 
cease to ' beck ' and begin to look for an early break- 
fast. It is not a sport for a neophyte, but an old hand 
often manages to bag several grouse in the course of 
an outing. It must not oe supposed that this is 
necessarily regarded as poaching. In Yorkshire, in 



GROUSE-BECKING 69 

Cumberland, and Westmoreland, if not in other 
counties, ' becking ' for grouse is or was recognised as 
a highly entertaining sport, and frequently put into 
exercise, though it has latterly fallen into disuse. 
Still no old-fashioned keeper in Lakeland or on the 
Border thinks anything of getting a brace or two of 
grouse for his master's larder by ' becking.' Lots of 
stirring stories about this sport are told by the reserved 
dalesmen ; but they are shy of favouring strangers 
with their confidences, and any irregularities that they 
happen to allude to, are sure to have happened to some 
acquaintance, for they are too sharp to willingly com- 
promise themselves. 

One of the most successful of latter-day fowlers 
was a ' proper poacher,' who chiefly resided in Durham 
and Northumberland, working at his trade as a miner. 
Cumberland was his native county, and he came home 
occasionally in order to indulge in a spell of poaching 
on his favourite preserves, the keeper in charge being 
his particular enemy. One fine morning late in autumn, 
when a sharp frost had just set in, the ' proper poacher ' 
rose betimes and shook himself, after which he strolled 
off to the hill, a moor near Crossfell, to call grouse. 
The weather was so specially propitious that he felt 
certain of some exciting sport, nor was he disappointed. 
He had no sooner arrived at his hiding place, and ' got 



70 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



set,' than he began to call. To his satisfaction he 
was very soon answered by a grouse, which alighted 
on a knoll within shot of his position. He took a 
very careful aim with his old muzzle-loader, and his 
finger was already touching the trigger, when, to his 
astonishment, another gun 'went off and shot t' bird.' 
Recognising the sportsman who had spoilt his shot, 
he deemed it prudent to slip home unnoticed and 
return to bed. A few hours later the keeper, who had 
evidently expected to meet him on the moor, called 
at his lodgings and proceeded to chaff the poacher 
whose practices troubled him, with the homely inquiry, 
' What's matter thou isn't out this morning ? ' The 
old hand could not conceal his annoyance any longer, 
and he blurted out the fact which he had tried to 
conceal : ' If thou'd been half a minute langer, lad, 
thou'd have seen whether I was out or not ! ' 

Frosty weather suits the pastime of ' becking ' best 
dry frost, that is to say, unaccompanied by any 
serious fall of the temperature. It must be under- 
stood that ' becking ' is not always successful even on 
days that appear highly favourable. There are days 
when the birds ' beck ' freely and others when they 
will hardly ' beck ' at all, though no reason for their 
acting differently on these occasions can be fairly 
assigned. The champion ' becker ' of a certain fell- 



GROUSE-BECKING 7 1 



side village is the local shoemaker, who loves to 
narrate his experiences. It so fell out, he says, that 
upon a certain day he started soon after midnight for 
a favourite spot, distant about six miles from his 
cottage, and situated in the very heart of a ' smittle ' 
place for grouse. The track was ill defined, and he 
seemed to be a long time in arriving at his destination. 
When at length he reached the scene of his intended 
operations, he sat down in the moss and waited for 
the approach of the grey twilight. After long suspense 
at last his ears were gladdened with the much-desired 
challenge of an old cock grouse. He called in .answer, 
and the bird responded and flew nearer and nearer, 
until the exciting moment arrived when he saw the 
moorfowl 'sit up' upon a prominent tuft of heather. 
Taking a careful aim, as he thought, with his heavy 
fowling-piece, he pulled the trigger, and, as he thought, 
killed his bird. However, he was too old a hand to 
show himself prematurely, and as his gun was only a 
single muzzle-loader, he thought it best to reload before 
he jumped up. But no sooner had he rammed a 
fresh charge home than he looked up and spied the 
bird sitting on the tuft of heather as before. He 
concluded that he must have missed it after all, and 
he took a second shot at it with a similar result. To 
cut the story short, our hero fired nine successive 



72 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

shots, as he declares, without ever leaving his hiding 
place, at a grouse which seemed to lead a charmed life, 
as it always reappeared. He fired a tenth shot ; no 
bird could be then seen. He therefore jumped up, 
and ran to the knoll of heather, where he found no 
fewer than ten dead grouse disposed around the spot 
that had proved so fatal. His explanation was this : 
that he had fallen in with a company of birds which 
were running close together, and that each time that 
he fired and knocked over a bird, another bird in the 
company ascended the point of danger to make a fresh 
reconnaissance. It is not at all unusual for an old hand 
to get a brace of birds at one spot in the half light of 
approaching day. If a bird offers a chance to the 
gunner, but is missed and flies away, its companion is 
pretty certain to follow it. On the other hand, if one 
bird is shot dead, and drops still upon the heather, 
its companion will probably remain waiting for it to 
rise, and perhaps afford a second shot. Grouse can 
be shot in this way at any time between August and 
March, but the last months of the year are held in 
most esteem. 

In March the male grouse are very restless, and 
fly from one knoll to another, frequently alighting. 
They still ' beck,' but their cry has become slightly 
altered since the autumn ; they now seem to say 



GROUSE-BECKING 73 



' churrr gobaek, goback." 1 It would be interesting to 
know whether the custom of ' becking ' was practised 
by our forefathers when they shot with crossbows. 
I am inclined to fancy that in those days their larders 
were often supplied with snared grouse, which had 
been captured upon the ' stooks ' of corn. Probably 
the methods of setting snares for grouse are various, 
as indeed I know they are. That which appears to 
be most extensively practised, at any rate in the north 
of Scotland, is to prepare a number of snares of fine 
wire and attach them to a stout cord, which is then 
stretched across a ' stock ' of oats, the ends of the 
string being securely attached to two stakes which 
have been driven into the ground on either side of 
the ' stook.' Another plan is to set a great number 
of snares in the runs which the grouse make through 
the heather when feeding. These snares are generally 
made of fine copper wire, bent in the form of a loop 
of from five to six inches in diameter. The free end 
of the wire is doubled, and attached to a tuft of ling 
by a piece of string. The loop of wire is often held 
in the proper position by a small cleft piece of wood. 
Some men take grouse in drag-nets, when the birds 
are roosting in rough grass and young heather ; but I 
fancy that this method of poaching grouse is less 
practised than formerly. Sportsmen cannot be too 



74 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



careful to enlist the interest of herds and shepherds in 
the preservation of grouse. The goodwill of the small 
farmers and tenants of allotments abutting on the 
moors should be courted sedulously, and their for- 
bearance rewarded. I say so, as indicating a practical 
policy, for these men have many temptations to acquire 
birds dishonestly, or, as a working man expressed it, 
' There can be no bigger poachers if they take it that 
way.' Some individuals allow their dogs to snap sit- 
ting grouse. Colley bitches are often apt pupils in 
such nefarious practices. The story goes that a coun- 
tryman was known on a certain occasion to have 
prematurely exhausted his credit at the bar of the 
' pub ' he patronised, for he was thirsty still. He 
then inquired of a friend if the 'laal bitch' was at 
home. Being answered in the affirmative, he called 
for the sheepdog, and having taken her to the hill, he 
soon returned with a brace of ' snapped ' grouse, which 
renewed his credit. On another occasion the sheep 
were being gathered a small farmer who had volun- 
teered to assist the shepherds was observed to be 
carrying his short coat over his arm with more than 
usual carefulness. On inquiry being made, it turned 
out that this rascal had allowed his cur-dog to snap 
a whole covey of little grouse. The clog's master 
willingly joined in the illegality ; to quote his own 



GROUSE-BECKING 75 



words, ' He thought he would have a pie when he got 
home.' But how was the game to be stowed away ? 
He had tied the sleeves of his jacket, so that they 
were converted into bags, in which the birds were 
nicely concealed. He then turned the coat inside 
out, in order that the sleeves might not be seen, and 
congratulated himself upon his cleverness in smuggling 
stolen grouse. Mr. J. G. Millais unearthed an old 
Highland poacher, who explained an ingenious method 
of capturing both grouse and ptarmigan which is often 
adopted in Ross-shire and Sutherland when the snow 
is deep. ' The poacher discovers a place on the hill 
where the birds are in the habit of sitting when snow 
has fallen. To this spot he repairs when the down- 
fall has ceased, and before night if possible, so that 
the snow may be still soft and not fro/en. He is 
armed with nothing but a bag of oats or corn, and a 
beer or, still better, champagne bottle. Thus, having 
nothing of a suspicious nature in his possession, he 
would be allowed to pass, even though searched. 
Arrived on his ground, he proceeds to make a number 
of indentations in the snow with his bottle, and the 
bottom of the cavity, just within reach of the birds, 
he fills up with grain, and, scattering the rest of the 
contents of the bag near the holes on the surface, 
he departs, to return next morning and collect his 



76 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 



plunder. Unless a frost occurs the trick must neces- 
sarily be a failure, but if the cavity becomes properly 
hardened, and the birds find the food, success is 
almost a certainty. A grouse or ptarmigan finding 
what to them is a great delicacy, immediately imparts 
the knowledge of its presence to others in the neigh- 
bourhood. They at once greedily devour all the 
grain that is lying around, and then turn their atten- 
tion to obtaining the stores lying in the holes. Pro- 
bably by straining their necks to the uttermost they 
may be able to reach a few grains, but this only serves 
to whet their appetites, and they must have more. 
Consequently they go on reaching till they eventually 
topple over into the hole, which just comfortably cor- 
responds to their own size, and in which the more 
they struggle to extricate themselves the more firmly 
do they become wedged. When a bird is forced into 
a hole, even should the sides be smooth, it is not 
easily withdrawn, as the feathers resist being pulled 
backwards ; but when the sides are rough the reten- 
tion is doubly great, and the feeble strugglings of the 
unfortunate bird in its cramped position are not suffi- 
cient to enable it to escape.' 

Of late years much vexation has been occasioned 
to sportsmen in the north of England by the deadly 
practice of netting grouse with fixed engines. These 



GROUSE-BECKING 77 



consist of nets made of very fine twine, netted to a 
three-inch mesh, which are suspended from poles 
placed ten yards apart, at such a height as permits 
the fellside sheep to pass under them. Each net in 
a series is independently suspended on a cord stretched 
across the poles, and can be hung tight or loose, as 
desired. They are easily put up at least, I am 
assured that two men can fix up a thousand yards of 
nets in an hour. The nets are shifted according to 
the direction of the wind. Grouse have generally a 
favourite line of flight, but they do not always adhere 
to the same course. When the birds are flying, there 
is sure to be a leader in the company. This one strikes 
the net almost to a certainty, and down it instantly 
falls. The way in which these nets are worked is 
very simple. Of course they could not be tolerated 
on any gentleman's moor, but certain outsiders hire 
small farms and allotments on the edge of grouse 
moors, with a view to annexing their neighbours' 
grouse. The birds themselves assist inadvertently 
in their own capture. Their principal time for shift- 
ing about is in the evening, after feeding, and again 
after 'becking' in the morning. I'.ul they are par- 
ticularly restless on many moors about the end of 
September and in October, especially the female 
birds, and the first strong gale brings many of them 



78 NATURAL HISTORY OF THE GROUSE 

off the hill-tops, looking for more sheltered and genial 
situations. Naturally, many of them seek the edges 
of the moors, and are caught in the nets set upon 
such allotments as abut upon them. This method of 
netting grouse is very disastrous. The mischief of 
capturing the birds is only part of the evil. The 
worst feature about it is that the hens are caught in 
such numbers as seriously to interfere with the breed- 
ing stock. It is true that birds of both sexes will fly 
a long distance to a patch of black heather during a 
prevalence of severe frost and heavy snow, but earlier 
in the season the number of hens caught generally 
outnumbers the cocks very seriously. The reason 
for this seems to be twofold. The hens shift about 
in packs more irregularly than their male companions, 
and they are less partial to the high grounds, but seek 
the lower portions of the moor, and such as are most 
screened from the east winds. Fine open weather, 
however, suits the grouse-netters best, and they say 
that the birds fly very long distances when shifting 
about the hills. The old cocks keep their own 'heaf,' 
or station, on the hill' with more constancy than their 
female companions. In the morning the birds 'start 
to feed ' soon after they cease ' becking,' but they do 
not feed so heavily in the forenoon as later in the 
day, an hour or two before dusk especially, when 



GROUSE-BECKING 79 



their crops become distended with food. In the 
morning hours they like to sun themselves in dry 
moss or on an open slab of rock, each bird resting 
with one wing expanded like a fowl. As for the ways 
of disposing of poached grouse, they are manifold. 
Sometimes they are hawked about the country by 
persons selling peat. Often they are taken to market 
with other produce. The railways and parcel post 
both offer excellent facilities for furthering the distri- 
bution of the birds. Personally, I was once favoured 
with a fine red grouse in rather an unexpected fashion. 
Our keeper happened to shoot an Iceland gull, and 
wrote to inform me that he despatched the bird to 
me by that day's parcel post. His letter came, but 
no gull appeared, and I therefore begged* the Post 
Office authorities to make a search for the lost bird. 
The gull arrived eventually by rail. Meantime the 
postal authorities had taken counsel, and finding that 
a grouse without a label had come into their posses- 
sion, they forwarded to me the moor-fowl, plucked 
and roasted as it was, with a polite intimation that 
they conjectured that this, being evidently a bird of 
some description, might probably prove to be the 
Iceland gull that had gone astray.

CHAPTER I 

'THE SCOTCH MAIL' 

THE lamps are being lit in Bloomsbury. Long ago 
they have begun to twinkle in the small bird shops of 
the ' Dials,' and to flare in the gin palaces of the 
avenues. As the dull brown haze of a London 
August evening settles down the streets become 
thicker with people, and every tenement in this part 
of the town pours forth its quota to the stream upon 
the pavement, there to strut or loaf, or drink away 
its short hour of ease, until bed, straw, and plank 
receive once more the weary bones of the toilers of 
the city. 

As your cab rattles along towards Euston or 
King's Cross the wheels spatter black mud legacy 
of the leaden drizzle of the afternoon -upon the pale 
faces and ragged clothing of the drni/.ens of the

crowds, to whom gas serves for air, garbage for food. 
and vitriol for drink ; who have nr\vr trod a hillside

or leapt a stream, and to whom heather and rock, 
bracken and pine are as unknown as the Ovis Poll 
to an Islington butcher. 

Bound as you are for the land where these gifts 
of Nature, added to the charms of stag, salmon, and 
grouse, await you in plenty, the contrast between your 
happy state of mind and the cheerless, airless lives of 
these people is brought vividly before you, and you 
must give a glance of sincere pity to the groups of pallid 
faces whiter and thinner, it seems to you, than usual 
huddled together in dark doorways, or peering 
hungrily from cellar gratings. 

But you and I were not ' born to set it right '- 
here is the great railway station looming dark but 
welcome through the fog, the narrow shave of an 
upset as you drive in at the tall narrow gates, the line 
of flashing lamps and eager porters, and as you leap 
*o the ground and hand your minor baggage to the 
old man with a face like a winter apple, and well- 
worn patches of grey on the familiar green corduroy, 
the squalor of the Dials passes from your mind, and 
cheerfully you set your face towards the North. 

Tickets are taken, luggage stowed, dogs bundled 
in, rod, gun, rifle, and cartridge cases carefully seen 
to, book selected, sleeping berth inspected, and ere 
you have quite finished the final instructions to

the trusty servant who remains in town, suddenly, 
with no more warning than a short blast from the 
pea-whistle of the smart guard, the great train begins 
to glide slowly and smoothly away. As you pull up 
the window, a shout of ' Good-bye ! ' from some less 
fortunate person, seeing off a dear friend, rings along 
the platform, and turning back into the well-lit 
carriage you realise, as the train plunges into the 
dark tunnel under Hampstead with a quickening 
pace and an increasing rattle, that you are fairly 
off. 

But you are very tired ; the last day's business 
has been heavy and anxious, and you haven't yet 
shaken off the clinging meshes of your work-a-day life. 
Wearily you lean back in your seat, and as the 
hoarse roar of the tunnels and the flying flashes of 
the station lamps tell of the terrific pace at which 
the train is now travelling, you sink, the end of your 
cigar glowing fiercer in the dim light, into a lethargy 
variously tinged with care and hope. Presently you 
rouse yourself to make arrangements for the night, 
hand your tickets to the civil 'conductor,' with in- 
structions to wake you half an hour before Perth, 
dispose your bed and wraps, and before darkening 
the light pull down the window for a moment to sniff 
an air that blows fresher and sweeter than St. Stephen's,

Capel Court, Lincoln's Tnn, or Pall Mall, and to be- 
come aware that you are tearing over the borders of 
Hertfordshire at fifty-five miles an hour, on a magnifi- 
cent starlight night. The great oaks and elms of old 
England fleet by you like streams of cardboard trees, 
the long, low landscape fades into the blue-black of 
the sky, and so steady is the going that the distance 
seems like a slow dioramic procession of woods and 
hills, while you alone are motionless, and the nearer 
objects houses, fences, telegraph poles, parapets, or 
platforms but so many formless phantoms, rushing 
with roar, scream, and rattle back to the South. 

Then comes sleep, in which the monotonous vibra- 
tion of the train reiterates itself persistently, and intrudes 
upon your dreams ; your clients, patients, colleagues, 
or opponents whispering vague things to you to the 
eternal accompaniment of the noise of the wheels, 
their words and your replies always twisted to fit in 
with the exact beats of the pulse of the engine or the 
clicking of the coupling irons. A slackening, a hissing, 
and a cessation of the throbs give you a moment of 
conscious sanity at Rugby. This has no concern for 
you: you gather your rugs, always slipping off on to 
the floor, more tightly round, and as the porters, like 
far-off ghosts shouting to each other in a huge cavern, 
repeat the well-known name, all you can think of is 



THE SCOTCH MAILS 87 



that Dickens wrote something wonderful about Rugby 
Junction, and that you once knew a man who kept 
horses there and hunted from London very incon- 
venient, but you are asleep again. 

This time fairly and placidly, with hardly a pause 
in a vivid but pleasantly long dream, while you are 
whirled unconscious past the flaming cities and lurid 
wastes of the Black Country, to the open pure 
country, and suddenly, for no reason, you are broad 
awake ; a cold grey daylight is slanting through the 
cracks of the blinds, and the sight of your bundle of 
fishing rods in the corner reminds you that you have 
left London and business, and are going to the moors. 

Ah, but it was the cold that woke you, for you are 
chilly, and drag down your cape the old cape that has 
sheltered you from so many driving showers and cut- 
ting winds, that has been so often stained with blood 
and peat, oil and sea water, tea and travel fold your- 
self in it up to your chin, and lie there in the grey 
dawn, thinking, listening to the occasional whistle of 
the engine, wondering whereabouts you are and what 
time it is, but supremely happy. 

Your whole nature seems to have undergone some 
change. A purer air is filling your lungs, and though 
you have a very slight sore throat, and are, generally 
speaking, dirty, unkempt, and chippy, a wondrous calm 



88 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

has come over your whole being. No longer do the 
cares or dilemmas of yesterday assail your peace ; 
the House of Commons and the City how small 
and far off they appear, as a little gleam of pale 
sunlight illumines the details around you, and a 
smothered rumbling tells that you are crossing a 
bridge over a river. You must look out ; up goes 
the blind ; and there, there are the everlasting hills. 
Great grey-green slopes of Cumberland fells, patched 
and scored with heaps and rifts of slaty stone, black 
in the shadow and white and wet in the light ; veils 
and wreaths of misty shower, like puffs from a colossal 
steam-engine, travelling across the face of rock or 
grass ; far up, a little slender white thread of a water- 
fall you can almost hear the trickle and splash of 
the water on the stones, or trace the sound of its 
gurgling rush down through the beds of granite, 
fringed with greener bracken, to the valley. 

Black cattle grazing unconcerned along the lower, 
white sheep on the higher slopes ; straggling stone walls 
of any age dividing the huge pastures ; deep dens 
down which the foaming becks are pouring, where the 
mist clings longer and blacker until the early flight of 
chattering rooks and jackdaws crossing to their feed 
is relieved in deeper notes of black against it. 

Now comes the sun, slanting along the hill, gilding 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL' 89 

the knolls and silvering the wet stones ; the puffs of 
curling mist seem to draw themselves higher up, grow 
whiter and more palpable in his rays, and become 
absorbed in the solid gold-white mass of cumulus 
cloud floating against the blue of this glorious summer 
morning. 

The hills, too, seem to have grown farther off, the 
landscape is lower, rich crops and waving corn appear, 
the silver stream of Eden reflects red bridges and black- 
green woods, and in a few more minutes a vision of 
red stone and brick, of old grey wall and clustering 
chimney, of filmy smoke against the luminous air, 
and ' Carr-lisle ' rings in a clear northern voice 
along the platform ; the train is still once more. 

It is yet very early, and feeling warmer and more 
restful, though you peep out to look along the train 
(why ?), you do not care to rise. The northern dialect of 
the porters, contrasted with the accent of your London 
guard, arrests your ear for a moment ; you have time 
to note a few types, shepherds and nondescripts, loaf- 
ing into the station as the light brightens, to catch 
some local train or receive some unsavoury package, 
and you are away again. 

Soon appear the flat marshes that fringe the 
Solway Firth, the broad stretch of still water outside 
the reeds reflecting: the white whms of the gulls or 



90 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the strings of fowl rising seaward, the fainter, longer 
lines of the estuary, and far off, flecked with little 
diamond flashes of white in the sun, the great grey 
sea itself. Lines of black posts, of which you wonder 
the use and meaning, stretch through- the reeds from 
the shore, as though seedlings from the black timbers 
of the long low bridge that carries you across the 
marsh. Little cottages nestling under sycamore and 
birch come in sight ; the great wreaths of steam from 
the engine float and fade away over the landscape, and 
as they whisk across a little village of white houses, 
brush over the slate roofs, and dance away into the 
fields beyond, a long wooden platform rattles past 
you, and the magic word ' Gretna,' in white letters on 
a blue board, tells that you are fairly over the Border, 
and fills your mind with thoughts of the comedies and 
tragedies which many such a glorious morning has 
witnessed around the blacksmith-parson's cot on the 
historic green. 

What a contrast ! The whizz of your train, ' speed 
forty-five miles an hour,' with its living freight of a 
hundred persons, tearing past the little station, and 
the swaying, rolling post-chaise, with its steaming 
horses and sweating postboys, bearing the blushing 
girl-bride, the gallant bridegroom in laced cocked hat 
and coat, still in his hand the pistol with which he

91 



shot the leader of the pursuing chaise some ten miles 
back, clattering over the rudely paved main street and 
pulling up at the blacksmith's door ! 

Ah ! times are changed ; now no one stops at 
Gretna except by creeping trains to which in Bradshaw 
the ominous syllable ' Gov.' is tacked, and you yourself, 
sailing along in your sleeping car, to which a king's 
litter of a past age is for cost and cunning workman- 
ship but a cheap and tawdry conveyance, are already 
among the rolling moors of Dumfries, and were you 
not so sleepy would be craning your neck at the window 
to catch sight of a brood of grouse rising lazily off the 
stone wall by the railway, and settling down again 
upon the nearest heathery knoll, crowing to the sun. 

A second sleep comes over you, veiling your 
thoughts with delicious visions. Little you reck of 
the sweating toilers pausing by the great furnaces and 
glowing cinder heaps of Motherwell to stare as you 
roll by ; little of the clankings and shoutings, the 
shuntings and bumpings of inevitable Larbert ; little 
of the rush through station and town, past castle and 
cottage, manse and moor ; the rattle of wheels, the 
clanking of the iron, and the regular pant of the 
piston-rod have become your lullaby ; and you are 
enjoying a foretaste of the rest that we are promised 
in heaven. 



92 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

The Dials wake to their dirt, Bloomsbury to its 
business, and the slums to their squalor ; the lamps 
are out again now, and the sickly rays of morning 
rouses the pallid city folk to another day of struggling 
toil. The shiverings and fevers, vices and terrors, 
miseries or murders of the London night are even 
now being turned out naked to its bitter glare ; the 
thundering din of traffic, the bawling of commerce, 
and the shrieking of machinery drown in their deafen- 
ing chorus the weeping of the weak, the moans of 
the sick and dying, the cries of all their victims. 
Only the strong, the clever, and the hopeful awake to 
live in the stream that can no more be stemmed than 
the tide of the ocean the overwhelming civilisation of 
a great city. 

But you speed on in peaceful oblivion of all this, 
in which at other times you bear your part, while you 
are carried over hills and valleys clad with purple 
heather, under a sky of boundless blue flecked with 
shining white clouds, swaying gently round the 
shoulders of great hills, gliding across deep ravines 
and in and out of peaceful glens, threading through 
thriving towns or lazy villages. But now some 
curious change in the music of the train noises 
first puzzles, then half rouses you, and then, two 
feet from your ear, one piercing cry of ' Scotsman,' 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL' 93 

uttered in the shrill nasal twang of a Lowland newsboy, 
brings you straight up on your seat, and you are 
broad awake to find yourself at Perth. Hastily you 
get over a doubtful toilet, and feeling now as fresh as 
a lark, embark upon the sea of confusion which the 
great platform presents. Breakfast, rapid and hearty, 
refreshes you, and as you superintend the change of 
your baggage into another train for you are bound 
still farther north you have time to cast greetings to 
many an old friend, a bow or a smile to some fair 
ladies, and an oath or a caress to a brace of handsome 
setters who, coupled together and panting with excite- 
ment, have run between your legs and nearly upset 
you. 

This is a shorter though slower run, and you feel 
yourself growing nearer and nearer to the magnet that 
is drawing you northward. Leisurely you mark the 
bloom on the heather, the emerald of the moss on 
the walls, the bright brown colour of the river, and the 
rings of the trout where he rises in the still, deep pool ; 
and as a greyhen sails out of the scrub and into a 
pine wood, you reflect with satisfaction on your 
new Purdeys, with the ejectors, and on the ' first-rate 
consignment ' of Schultze powder with which your 
cartridges are loaded. 

But here you are arrived ! The sunshines brightly, 



94 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the breeze blows freshly, and there is no emperor or 
sultan that may not envy your feelings as you cover 
the short mile from the little station to the lodge in a 
useful brown dog-cart with a fast-trotting pony in the 
shafts. 

A warm welcome from your host, and you are not 
long in slipping into your shooting things, and ere the 
clock has struck eleven are bowling along with a cheery 
party to the moor. As you step on to the heather, 
and feel the true moorland breeze in your face, your eye 
is as keen and clear as the lens of a microscope, and 
crossing the plank bridge over the river you pause to 
mark in the brown waters flecked with snowy foam the 
swirl where the big fish rose only yesterday, after the 
great spate, which has left streamers of sodden hay, 
dead logs, and leafy twigs clinging to the timbers of 
the bridge and the overhanging birches at the side, 
twelve feet above the present placid level of the 
stream. 

Can there be such a thing as toil or business, as 
the turmoil of party strife or the grasping greed of 
gain, in musty chambers, foetid alleys, and paved courts? 
It would be difficult to believe in their existence as 
you survey the heavenly prospect before you after 
climbing somewhat laboriously, it must be confessed 
the first rounded knoll above the river, and paus-

ing to watch the dogs uncoupled and to give a first 
eager and searching glance over your ground. 

In the foreground the trim figures in grey home- 
spun of your companions and the keepers, their keen 
and healthy faces relieved against the peat or heather, 
the polished gun-barrels glistening in the sun, the 
liver and the white dog taking their first scamper, the 
sturdy custodian of the ponies and the lunch, the 
kilted boy with the other couple of dogs, the seedling 
birches and feathery young larches of the moor edge 
flickering in the golden light of the August noon, to 
the sound of the steady roar of the great fall of waters 
at the tail of the pool behind you. 

Beyond, the colouring is gorgeous away for 
miles the slopes and shoulders, the knowes and 
hollows of purple and pink heather stretch to where 
the glassy loch lies shimmering under the solemn 
precipices of a mighty peak with an historic name. 
Supporting him on either side are ranged the rugged 
forms of his giant brethren a study in faint grey and 
blue, with here and there a patch of dwindling snow 
to tell of the bitterness of the recent storm. In this 
glorious amphitheatre you attack your sport. The 
white dog comes to a dead point on your side of a 
knoll, and is beautifully backed by the liver-coloured 
bitch, who halts on a great piece of flat rock some

seventy yards away, a motionless and perfect picture. 
Three grouse rise, you kill with your first, and, your 
host courteously waiting to let you deal with your first 
right and left alone, strike the second hard but under- 
neath, while he neatly drops the third bird a beautiful 
long cross shot. 

Exactly sixteen hours from the time you were 
driving through Bloomsbury you have killed a right 
and left of Perthshire grouse, on a spot which fifty 
years ago would have taken eight days to reach, if 
even in those days there had been anyone to try it. 

The details of your day's sport, so well known in 
their incidents, we will not follow. After a glorious 
day, very weary, but, having acquitted yourself well, 
supremely contented, what more delicious than the 
long drive home down the glen, the moor darkling 
on either side, the shadow deepening to blackness 
as you wind through the big pine wood and are 
shown against the western sky the capercailzie in 
their accustomed place on the giant larch that over- 
hangs the road, or the spot where the greyhen killed 
herself against the carriage ? Turning out of the 
wood you come upon all the glory of the yellow 
moon, just rising over the eastern hill, and glittering in 
the waters of the loch ; the horses quicken their pace, 
lights twinkle in the distance, and now as you swing 



'THE SCOTCH MAIL* 97 

in at the gate of the lodge grounds a savoury whiff 
courts your nostrils from the shining kitchen window, 
while as you turn the corner to the door the first 
skirl of the pipes warns you that it is already half- 
past eight, the ladies are waiting, and you must be 
quick down to dinner. 

A journey such as I have tried to describe is only 
one of the many combinations which English brains 
and love of sport have rendered not only possible but 
usual. Truly the red grouse is responsible for many 
things in these days, and, let envious or ignorant 
persons sneer as they may, will continue to be so for 
many years to come until, in short, some one cleverer 
than the rest of the world invents a means of driving 
a plough through a peat bog, or dragging a harrow 
across the rocky glens of Scotland and the north of 
England. 

The grouse has his influence over politics, as 
we are constantly reminded ; over trade and railway 
enterprise ; and last, but not least, over the well-being 
and prosperity of a large proportion of our population. 
The moors are to an Englishman what ' les eaux ' are 
to the Frenchman, or the Alps to an Italian. Even 
the wealthy Frenchman and the Italian arc, with the 
millionaire American or Austrian prince, to lie found 
pouring their gold into the pockets of the Highlander,

in pursuit of the hardy and succulent race of birds 
which will soon represent the only British monopoly 
in the world, and which are known as grouse. 

Observe the scientific knowledge, the inventive 
power, the practical resource, and the financial enter- 
prise which go to make up every detail of the 
marvellous journey from the south to the north of 
Great Britain. Short as it may seem to the man from 
New York or Chicago, it is still in moral and material 
detail the most remarkable piece of travelling in the 
world. And what has produced this? Not all the 
beauties of Edinburgh nor all the factories and 
furnaces of Glasgow; not the enterprise of Dundee 
nor the fisheries of Aberdeen ; nay, neither the 
Trossachs nor the Pass of Killiecrankie, the snows of 
Ben Nevis nor the depths of Loch Lomond, but 
grouse, grouse and nothing else ! 

It would be idle to attempt to forecast the political 
condition of these crowded islands in the next century, 
but of this I think we may be tolerably certain that 
so long as the everlasting hills remain as they are, 
until, in short, some unthought-of metal, some un- 
expected industry arises to people their glens, tunnel 
their heights, and crush their rocks, so long will 
grouse remain a potent factor in the internal economy 
of the northern portion of our race. 



' THE SCOTCH MAIL ' 99 



It is notoriously difficult to get a straight answer 
from a Scotchman, but this year, in conversation with 
a very intelligent specimen of the Highlander, who 
was, by the way, an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. 
Gladstone, the replies that I elicited to my very direct 
questions were so emphatic in favour of the existing 
state of things, founded on his own intimate know- 
ledge, that I wished some of those narrow city dwellers, 
feeble in body and spiteful and envious in mind, who 
so far as they dare attack everything in the nature of 
sport and amusement, could have heard him on this 
well-worn subject. 

He would have none of the small crofter, who 
starves himself and his family for a false sentiment 
which ties him to the barren rock or spongy morass 
which never can support them ; he was all in favour 
of the large grazing farm of many thousand acres, and 
of the wealthy sporting tenant from the South, who 
comes to distribute his guineas and to repeople the 
once famine-stricken glen. The men, he urged with 
vehement sincerity and actual knowledge, who clamour 
for the small holdings, have not the means to stock 
them, nor those who encourage them the knowledge 
to show them how to do it. How could these people 
divide and pasture a hill, command a market for their 
stock, or live in any fashion upon their allotted piece 

II 2 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



of ground ? Pointing eloquently to the ruins of 
many cottages of a bygone age, high up the glen near 
the burn-side, he discoursed of the evils of the starv- 
ing, hopeless life these little squatters led, and truly 
observed that no men of to-day with any self-respect 
would live huddled together in the filth and smoke, 
and half-nourished on the snatches of meagre food 
which were their normal conditions. 

Fewer people, he said, there might be in the glen, 
but there would after the first abortive trial be fewer 
still were the rich graziers and the sporting tenants, 
who between them employ so many hands and feed 
so many mouths, to be chased away, and their places 
taken by a lot of tag-rag and bob-tail with whom 
discontent passes for independence, and insolvency 
for liberty. ' Long live the grouse ! ' he cried ; ' they 
do not interfere with sheep, and nothing else, save 
eagles and foxes, hawks and stoats, could live up here.' 

I have dwelt at some length in another volume of 
this series ' on the important question of the relations 
between the owner or sporting tenant with the humbler 
folk who become his neighbours or dependants ; on 
the supreme importance, both to his sport and to the 
well-being of the district, of goodwill and liberality on 
his part and co-operation on theirs ; and I was rash 
1 Partridge, p. 239. 



enough to appear as an optimist on the Game-law 
question. What I said of English, I might repeat 
more securely of Scotch sport. The value of game 
to the country in general materially, from a com- 
mercial point of view ; morally, from the interests and 
sympathies it tends to create or maintain between 
members of different classes is enormous, and since 
it introduces civilisation and material prosperity to 
the most remote districts, it is especially so in the 
case of grouse. 

The Scotch mail, running at lightning speed along 
its well-laid track, with all its luxuries and scientific 
appliances, its sleeping or dining cars, its heating 
apparatus and lavatories, its air-brakes and electric 
bells, its magnificent locomotives and trusty servants, 
its priceless freights and distinguished occupants, is 
the most intrinsically valuable expression of this state 
of things. 

I ,ong may it continue to run ; long may the healthy 
attractions of the most picturesque and beautiful <>i 
llritish sports continue to fill its compartments, and 
help the dwellers of the far North to share the hard- 
earned gold of England's wealthier citizens ! 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER II 

' OVER DOGS ' 

To the average owner or tenant of a Scotch moor, 
grouse shooting means ' over dogs ' and nothing else. 
A few years ago such was the onslaught made upon 
driving and its partisans, that it became necessary to 
take up the cudgels in its defence. But now that all 
Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Durham have adopted it 
exclusively, and that many persons in Scotland have 
followed the example of these counties, the press and 
the public recognise that it is useless to abuse a system 
which those interested almost universally employ. 

In treating this subject I have been obliged to re- 
cord my honest conviction of the superiority of driving 
as an art, as well as of its advantages to the general 
stock of birds. But in a work of this kind one must 
endeavour to be just all round, and recognise the fact 
that there are many persons, some of them excellent 
shots and sportsmen, who would not on any account 
abandon the ancient and beautiful sport of shooting 



OVER DOGS' 103 



grouse over dogs, or to whom the organisation of 
drives would be neither convenient nor practicable. 

As a youth I duly graduated with Don and Ponto, 
' Wallass ' and Lady on the higher moors of Forfar, 
Perth, and Aberdeen, and approached a point with 
as much keenness as ever Colonel Hawker felt when 
sculling to a bunch of fowl on the ooze of Key- 
haven, or advancing on a covey in the sheltering 
stubbles of Longparish. Yet when I had been intro- 
duced to the increased excitement, the superior marks- 
manship, the ampler results, and the more picturesque 
aspect of the birds in Yorkshire driving, I became 
contemptuous of those who were content to plod day 
by day after their dogs for a much smaller number 
of comparatively easy shots. But one grows more 
catholic with age. I have had many pleasant days 
since then with other Dons and Pontos, and should 
regret as much as anyone to see the extinction of so 
valuable a race of dogs, or the complete abandonment 
of so picturesque a science. 

I recall few days' shooting with greater pleasure 
than a bag of fifty-three brace to my own gun, which 
I made on September 23, 1872, on the late Sir Charles 
Forbes's moor in Strathdon, Aberdeenshire, after many 
hundreds of brace had been taken off the ground by 
both driving and walking ; and that, considering the 



104 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

date, was a satisfactory performance. There is nothing 
in it, perhaps, even worth recording ; yet the fact re- 
mains that it is graven on my memory as a red-letter 
day, and ranks in my reminiscences of varieties of 
shooting with some of the best days of driving in 
which I have ever taken part. 

Shooting as practised in England is, on the whole, 
less selfish than most other forms of sport, yet it is 
also tinged with a proportion of the vice. I may, there- 
fore, be forgiven for saying that I think grouse shoot 
ing over dogs is eminently a sport which is best 
enjoyed alone that is, by one gun only. It is true 
that the party of two is the more correct form, granted 
that the pair work together absolutely without jealousy, 
and with exact knowledge of one another's powers. 
But these conditions are rare, and it is not too much 
to say that in no branch of shooting are greater 
sacrifices of result made to the essential qualities of 
courtesy and consideration for the capacity of your 
companion. If two guns can kill forty brace over 
dogs, you may be quite certain that the better of the 
two could have killed thirty brace, if not more, over 
the same ground on the same day. A good hand at 
the work can, if he chooses to set aside the unwritten 
laws of politeness and fair play, take so much advan- 
tage of an inferior hand as to practically absorb all 



<OVER DOGS' 105 



the chances, and obtain what satisfaction he may 
from achieving much the larger share of the bag. But 
a few hints may help a man who is not an adept to 
avoid finding himself always in the position of second 
best, or trying too severely the temper or good manners 
of his more accomplished companion. 

We will suppose that your dogs are well handled and 
steady, and that there is a fairly good scent, a breezy, 
pleasant day, and enough birds on the ground to 
reward you for hard work and good shooting, while 
for it is the object of this work to assist, if pos- 
sible, those who have something to learn you are 
alongside a man who is much your superior, possibly 
a past master of the art. The first thing to note care- 
fully and incessantly is the wind. This you must 
bear in mind all the time ; otherwise, when you see a 
point, you will be quite at sea as to where the birds 
are likely to be lying. There is no doubt that a 
wind blowing across the ground you are beating is 
altogether the best ; and supposing that you have 
as your allotted beat the long 'face' of a hill, with 
cultivated ground or pasture along the lower side, and 
the march on or just over the ridge on the upper, with 
the wind blowing downwards, it will be best to begin 
at the bottom, and work across and across till you 
have' beaten the whole face, and pushed all the birds 



io6 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

possible forward. You will thus drive them mostly on 
to some stretch of lower ground beyond, which will 
give you probably your best sport towards evening. 
As you work the ground in this way the birds will 
obviously be always lying above, that is, up wind of 
the dog, and the moment you see him point you 
should walk in a slant towards the ground above him, 
rather than straight to him as the novice would. If 
you do the latter, and your friend the professor is on 
your right, he will cross higher up, and probably, 
while appearing to let you go straight for the point 
and the best chance, walk right into the covey and 
get a double shot, while you, though still level with 
him, are yet a long way below the birds. Again, you 
must watch the behaviour of the dog narrowly. Should 
he stop very suddenly in full career, turning his head 
slightly back, then run quickly a few yards, do the 
same thing again, but appear unsteady and inclined 
to hunt further, he is probably up wind of the birds ; 
in which case walk pretty straight to where he first 
pointed. If, again, he simply points very steadily, go 
slowly up to him, a little up wind as before ; if he 
draws rather rapidly and keenly ahead, get after him 
slanting your course up wind of him as quickly as 
you can. These will be wild birds, probably old 
ones, whom it is most desirable to destroy, and they 



-OVER DOGS' 107 



will be running or creeping uneasily before him, most 
likely working up wind also. In this case you may 
get a shot by fast walking or running where you would 
not by going slowly. Come in to the point where you 
can across the wind and above the birds, so as to push 
them forward as you wish. If you get in or past them 
from below, they will be likely to go up to the ridge 
and off your ground, or swing back. 

Remember that a bird must always rise with his 
breast up wind, especially if it is blowing hard, and 
that there is no more killing moment than when he is 
just turning to go down the wind after the first rise. 
To be ready to take him like this, or in fact to kill 
any old or wild bird, you must have your gun ready 
to throw to the shoulder in a second, and must study 
your walking, so as not to be stumbling when he gets 
up. Husband your wind and your strength, especially 
in the early part of the day, as much as you can ; and 
fear not to take a good long rest at luncheon time, for 
the sake of your men, dogs, grouse, and yourself. Birds 
rest in the heat of the day, and the scent is weak ; 
morning and evening, but evening especially, is the 
time to make a bag. 

On the same piece of ground, should the lower 
side be bounded by the burn only, with good lying 
on the other side, it will be better to work the face 



toS SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



longways, taking a long beat along the lower side first, 
coming back almost on the empty ground and then 
repeating the manoeuvre, just as you would often do 
in a turnip field when you wish to push partridges 
forward. Again, if the wind be blowing exactly the 
reverse way that is, up hill I should advise taking 
the top beat first, or at least working the top side most 
as you cross and wheel, so as to protect the march. 
What I have suggested here applies when you have a 
long hill-face to beat, perhaps the simplest as well as the 
most frequent formation of grouse ground in Scotland. 
But when you have to beat an area of flat or undulating 
moorland above the hill-face, it is better to get straight 
to the higher part of the ground first. Grouse lie 
on higher ground during fine weather, and you must 
break them up on this, so as to deal with them later 
on when scattered on the lower ground. But in what 
I may term ' mixed weather ' they will be more on 
higher ground during the morning and middle-day 
than in the evening. In very wild, stormy, and wet 
weather, you had best, for the sake of your moor, not 
be out at all ; but if you are, it will depend entirely 
upon your observation of how the sheltered spots lie 
whether you get a bag or not. When the wind is very 
strong there is absolutely no chance of your finding 
broods lying on the windy side of a hillock or ridge. 



'OVEK DOGS' 109 



An odd old cock you will disturb sometimes from 
the most exposed places, and this I have never been 
able to explain, except on the theory that he has heard 
you coming from afar off, and run on to the exposed 
ground to look around for you. But then, again, these 
odd birds in exposed places sometimes lie very close, 
and rise with such a cackle as almost disturbs your 
nerves, so that we must suppose they have been able to 
find some special little bit of warm shelter which suits 
them, although on the windward side. But the bulk 
of the birds, and all the broods, will be found lying 
with some protecting ridge or hillock sheltering them 
from the wind. In perfectly calm, still weather you 
may almost do as you like, beating the ground regu- 
larly and extra closely, and so crossing it as to push 
the grouse on to the part you reserve for the late 
afternoon, with the proviso that you take the higher 
ground first. But whenever there is a breeze, and 
still more when it is blowing really hard, the science 
of making a good bag of grouse, given that you can 
walk and shoot well, is entirely a question of the con- 
stant study and observation of the wind. Remember 
that your dogs rely on it entirely you must therefore 
bear it in mind, so as to understand their movements ; 
your birds are guided by it in their choice of lying, in 
their method of rising, and in their eventual flight ; 



while your keeper, especially if Scotch, bases his 
entire scheme and conduct of the day's shooting 
mainly upon the same factor. A Scotchman reckons 
by the compass he never thinks of alluding to the 
right or left of anything, but guides himself, and at- 
tempts to guide you, by North and South, East and 
West. You must be guided by the same instinct to 
this extent that, whether E. or W., N. or S., you must 
bear in mind constantly as you follow your dog the 
direction of the wind, and the effect it is having upon 
the manner of his hunting, as well as upon the move- 
ments of the grouse. 

When you are following your dog directly up wind, 
should the ground rise directly in front of him get past 
him as noiselessly as possible, and as you peep over the 
ridge have your gun absolutely ready, and look out for 
a rise directly you show your nose over it. You will, 
in wild weather at least, get a difficult twisting shot, 
which you will be pleased to kill. If under the same 
circumstances you make any noise, or there is any 
calling or whistling to the dog, you will see nothing 
when you look over, but possibly a distant bird or 
covey, noiselessly skimming out of sight ; or, if you 
are not quite ready and smart, as you look over you 
will be beaten by the unexpected and tortuous flight 
of an old cock as he dashes away from you. 



OVER DOGS' 



The variations of pace or direction in which you 
approach the point must necessarily be founded more 
on experience and the true instinct of the hunter than 
on anything that can be taught ; but the novice may 
at least be warned that he cannot rely upon the keeper 
and the dog, even when aided by good shooting, ex- 
clusively to make the best bag possible. Rapidity 
and silence in getting to the point are very essential. 
Supposing the dog to be young and not very steady, 
he will draw on the birds, and in a few moments pro- 
bably get too close to them and put them up if they 
are sitting very light. You will say he can be checked 
by whistle or by the familiar ' To-ho ! ' and you can 
get up to them at your leisure. But they will pro- 
bably be flushed by this noise before you get there; 
whereas, if you can get up to the dog very quickly and 
without any noise of any kind, you may get your double 
shot, and the dog, even if he runs in on them at the 
last, can be chastised afterwards. No dog is worth 
anything unless he will stand without even the up- 
lifted hand; and to my thinking many a one is spoilt 
by being so used to this sign and the ejaculation of 
' Ho ! ' that he does not believe in the necessity of 
standing steady unless he hears it. This accounts 
for the loss of a great many chances, and for the too 
frequent cry of ' Hold up ! gone away ! ' which assails 



112 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



your disappointed ears when you come upon a bit of 
sheltered lying where the dog has been ranging for a 
moment or two out of sight. Unless, therefore, your 
dog is absolutely to be relied on to stand steady, you 
must, however much it may try your legs and wind, 
continually keep him in sight. This is frequently left 
to the keeper by the deliberate or indolent shooter. 
The dog disappears over a ridge, the keeper, becom- 
ing uneasy, runs swiftly and looks over, sees the dog 
drawing on birds, and immediately up goes the hand, 
and ' Ho ! ' he shouts. But the movements of the 
dog, the man's appearance on the skyline, and the 
shout are too much, and they are off. If you can 
get to the ridge and be down alongside the dog quickly 
enough the instant you see he has birds, you will very 
likely get your brace, where the slow man would have 
got nothing and never even seen the covey. On the 
other hand, especially in broken ground and deep 
heather, you cannot be too deliberate in quitting the 
ground where you have found close-sitting birds, or 
you may leave more than one easy certainty at a fine 
young bird from want of hunting carefully enough all 
round. 

Some men seem to have almost as keen an instinct 
as to whether there are birds near them as the dog, 
and this can hardly be acquired, though close watch- 



'OVER DOGS' 113 



ing of the habits of pointers or setters and their 
manner of hunting the ground will teach you much. 
Often when you have found birds up wind of the dog, 
especially if it is blowing pretty hard, it is worth while 
to make a cast back to see whether he has not struck 
the scent between two lots of birds, and whether there 
are not some more of them down wind of him. Espe- 
cially must all these points be attended to when you 
are hunting the ground which you have filled by 
driving broken coveys and scattered birds on to it. 
Towards evening every bit of such ground must be 
carefully searched, and you will soon acquire an eye 
for the likely patches for grouse to lie in. Activity 
and judgment are also much required when, as often 
happens on high ground, you have to work an area 
of deep moss-hags with steep sides of yielding peat, 
and intersected by little ravines, which, powdered with 
stones and, maybe, ancient roots, look like portions 
of the bed of some primaeval flood, (irouse on this 
sort of ground rarely lie well, being mostly old birds, 
or, if not, being on the move themselves from one 
hillock to the other, and here you will do twice as 
much execution if you utilise the ground in your 
pursuit. Keep as much as you can on the tops of 
the hillocks, leaping from one to the other; or, on the 
contrary, if you see a doubtful or uneasy point, and 

i 



114 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the ground favours you, running along between the 
hags, keeping carefully off the stones, and so getting 
noiselessly and rapidly up to the dog. 

In all these instances it will be observed how very 
difficult it becomes for t\vo guns to work harmoniously 
together so as to realise the best possible result ; but 
at least it should be agreed between them that, where- 
ever speed is necessary, the man nearest to the point 
should get to it without waiting for the other other- 
wise many chances must be lost. The two shooters 
should, therefore, be as evenly matched as possible. 
I think, where two parties go out on separate 
beats, it is better to send the two better or more 
active and the two slower together; each pair will 
enjoy their day more than on the mistaken principle 
of sending a good gun to ' nurse ' a bad one. This, 
unless they are both angels from heaven, is a trial of 
temper and a mortification to both. 

In very calm warm weather at the beginning of 
the season, where the cover is thick and the birds 
plentiful and tame, any two or even three men can 
take turn and turn about, and manage the amenities 
of the pursuit as easily as if they were beating a 
cabbage garden for very young partridges ; but this, 
though much affected by some gentlemen from town, 
and by dog producers I will not call them breakers 



OVER DOGS' 115 



who seem to think more of their beasts' coats or 
pedigrees than of their noses, is not the poetry of 
shooting over dogs. It is when the breeze is cool 
and keen, the heather wet from last night's rain, or 
glistening from a slight touch of early frost; when the 
distant range stands like Soracte, toweringly white 
with snow; when the burns run brown and full, the 
oats are ripened, and the hill-face is growing redder 
and more golden; when the river trout are stiff to rise, 
and the blackcock has almost his full tail then is the 
time when to follow a brace of good dogs, both you 
and they in first-rate trim, and to make a bag of 
grouse, is worth the doing. 

For this reason, revolutionary as it may seem, I 
would, supposing that you wish both to drive and 
walk your ground, drive it first and walk it afterwards. 
By so doing you will spare many young birds which 
should be left for breeding, you will get more shoot- 
ing and less waiting and exposure for your drives, and 
sport better worth having and under pleasanter con- 
ditions, granted you pick your days, for your shooting 
over dogs. 

The plugging at very young birds in the early days 
when the weather is hot, and many of them could be 
(or are) taken by the keeper with his hand, when dogs 
and men get knocked up before the day is half over, 

I 2 



n6 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

and hardly any shot you get is any satisfaction to kill, 
while it is a disgrace to miss, is not to my thinking 
worthy of a keen sportsman or accomplished gunner, 
unless he be well past the prime of life and merely 
takes it by short spells as an agreeable pastime. On 
the other hand this is a pleasanter time for your driving 
parties, and the waiting in the butts, always a trying 
operation, is at least not made worse by showers of 
sleet and snow or biting winds. 

After your driving days are over, in bright and 
cooler weather, when it is easier to walk and your con- 
dition is better, you will enjoy your day's point shoot- 
ing more than you have ever done on the Twelfth, for 
every point will test your dogs, every shot will try your 
skill, and every bird will be worth killing. I cannot 
believe, judging from experience, that driving will 
make the birds so wild as to preclude all shooting 
over dogs. I have seen many a good day over dogs 
after the ground had been driven several times, and 
the birds lying as well, on a favourable day, as any 
one need wish; and I am convinced that driving them 
does not make them any wilder, nor so wild, as con- 
stant walking after them with dogs. 

I am against walking the moor in line. This 
seems to be neither one thing nor the other ; it 
disturbs a large extent of ground and terrifies the 



1 OVER DOGS' 117 



birds, while the result is usually far from satisfactory 
as to the bag brought home. It is impossible to keep 
a long line of men, extending, say, 500 or 600. yards, in 
proper touch with one another on rough ground. To 
preserve the formation while one man has two or 
three birds to pick up, and the others, far away from 
him, are too anxious to walk on, is usually found to be 
impracticable, and the whole thing ends in a maraud 
more worthy of a gang of poachers than anything else. 

I shall not here attempt to enter into the ques- 
tion of the breeding, selection, or breaking of dogs. 
It is abundantly clear that to go out to make a 
bag of grouse, and to go out to train your dogs, 
arc two distinct things, and your dogs should 
not only be well broken, but well exercised and in 
good condition, before you attempt a serious attack 
upon your game. This work is devoted to the grouse 
and not to the dog, and therefore I trust that the 
only apology I need offer is for want of ability to deal 
with the former in the way that so grand a bird 
deserves. 

I confess to a preference for pointers where birds 
are plentiful and lying is good, and for setters under 
the contrary conditions, from their wide-ranging 
powers, and because I am, as remarked before, a 
strong advocate of rapidity of movement. 



il8 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

Three guns is an unreasonable number to send 
out in one party, unless you have an abnormal stock 
of grouse, and are anxious to kill all you can. The 
difficulties of dealing properly with the point, of getting 
up at the right moment, of all three shooting at the same 
bird, and other matters of varying skill and courtesy, 
are much increased. And if the grouse are lying well 
it is rather hard on the moor. Yet it is too often 
done. The young men of to-day mostly shoot pretty 
well, some few very well, and at any rate are pretty 
destructive at close-lying young birds ; and three ot 
them, with every appliance for quick loading and firing, 
will, as I have already pointed out with regard to 
partridges, kill far too many young birds, while they 
are more than likely to spare most of the old ones. 
These should always be selected where possible as 
your first victims, and I think that when you are 
working a wild beat on high ground, where birds are 
not too plentiful, you should not, when you come 
across a brood, follow it up to the death and massacre 
the whole family, but rather deliberately leave a 
brace of young birds here and there, and turn your 
attention as much as possible to the more difficult and 
fascinating art of circumventing the old inhabitants of 
the ground, my opinion of whom I have recorded in 
the chapter on Scotch Driving. The following extract 



'OVER DOGS' 119 

from Daniell's ' Rural Sports ' reads quaintly in the 
present day : 

' To shew the abundance, rather than the exploit 
itself (which by a Sportsman, must be hoped never 
will be repeated), the Earl of Strathmore's Game- 
keeper was matched for a considerable sum to shoot 
forty brace of moor-game in the course of the i2th of 
August upon his Lordship's moors in Yorkshire ; he 
performed it with great ease, shooting by two o'clock 
forty-three brace ; at eight in the morning, owing to 
a thick fog, he had only killed three birds, however the 
day cleared up by eleven, and the work of slaughter 
went on rapidly.' 

What would the Rev. Mr. Daniell have said could 
he have lived to see the bags more than once of over 
i, ooo brace in a day which have since been made on 
this very ground, ' his lordship's moors in Yorkshire,' 
the now famous Wemmergill and its neighbours ? 

We hope forty brace of moor-game in a day may 
often be killed again ; but it is a good bag even now to 
one gun over dogs, and no doubt there will always be a 
sufficiency of men able and willing to do it without 
forfeiting the title of 'sportsman.' 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER III 

SCOTCH DRIVING 

THERE are many things which distinguish grouse 
driving in Scotland from the same sport in England, 
and some difficulties to be overcome in the former 
country which are not ordinarily met with in the 
latter. Nevertheless, it will be my endeavour to show 
that the distinctions inseparable from Scotch driving 
merely add an attractive variety to the sport, and 
that the difficulties are by no means insuperable. 

Ever since the memorable season of 1872, of which 
more hereafter, and which, following as it did upon two 
very good seasons in iSyoand 1871, finally opened the 
eyes of the shooting world to the great possibilities of 
grouse, my opinion has been that on a very consider- 
able number of Scotch moors a scientific and practical 
system of driving, such as has been in force in York- 
shire for years, could and would produce results to 
equal the totals ordinarily achieved in that county, 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



and possibly to rival those of the most famous Eng- 
lish moors. 

I have often been opposed in this view, and 
even ridiculed, by men familiar for years with the 
conditions of what I may call an ordinary Scotch 
shooting, and even by some whose experience em- 
braced a large measure of both English and Scotch 
sport. Yet what are the facts? On many Scotch 
moors, notably in Ayrshire, where driving has been 
taken up systematically and scientifically, and where 
shooting over dogs has been abandoned, such respect- 
able bags as 250 and even 300 brace in a day have 
to be recorded ; while even as I write comes the news 
of a bag of- over 500 brace in one day, made on the 
moors of the Mackintosh, at Moy, in Inverness-shire. 

There are three principal reasons usually adduced 
to prove that driving in Scotland cannot be carried 
out with ordinary success, still less to the point arrived 
at in England : 

1. The unfavourable nature of the ground. 

2. The opposition or unwillingness of Scotch 
keepers. 

3. The difficulty of obtaining drivers. 

The last of these is in most instances the only one 
that constitutes a serious source of trouble, and tin's 
only applies to sparsely populated districts, where the 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



few inhabitants are obliged to take advantage of 
every moment of fine weather for their hay or corn 
harvest. 

I propose to consider these objections in detail, 
and try to point out how they may be best overcome. 

There are no doubt localities where the precipitous 
ground, intersected with deep ravines, and powdered 
with great rocks as though cast from a giant's hand, 
precludes any attempt at driving, excepting in a limited 
and desultory fashion, merely to give a day or two of 
variety. It is also superfluous to observe that where 
the grouse moor is merely a slight fringe to the higher 
ground or deer forest, driving need not be considered. 
But putting such districts out of the question, the 
great majority of Scotch moors are what, if I may coin 
a word for the purpose, I should call 'drivable.' 

More than this, there are many which are more 
suitable for driving, and would yield larger bags, than 
a second-rate Yorkshire moor. We are, of course, not 
here considering the comparative attractions or merits 
of driving as compared with shooting over dogs, but 
assuming that the owner or lessee of a moor in Scot- 
land would like to drive his grouse, and thereby 
improve his stock, but considers himself prevented 
by one or more of the difficulties I have named. 

It is a very common error to suppose that all 



SCOTCH DRIVING 123 



Yorkshire, Durham, or Derbyshire moors are quite 
flat, consisting entirely of heather at a certain elevation 
no doubt above the cultivated districts, but which, once 
reached, stretches far and wide in a series of very gentle 
undulations or perfectly flat tableland. A journey 
along the Settle and Carlisle branch of the Midland 
Railway, or a tour over the moors on the borders of 
Yorkshire, Durham, and Westmoreland, will soon 
dispel this. The gills, sikes, and becks of these 
counties are comparable to the glens and burns of 
bonnie Scotland, and the sources of the Ribble and 
the Wharfe, the Swale and the Ure, the Tees or the 
Wear, owe their wildest recesses to volcanic convul- 
sions hardly less violent than those which witnessed 
the birth of the Dee and the Spey, the Tay and the 
Tummel. Yet these southern rivers spring from 
and find their course through the heart of the most 
famous of the English moors, where more grouse 
have been killed in one day than many a Scotch 
keeper looks for in a whole season. 

Again, the low moors of Ayr, Dumfries, or Lanark, 
as well as of parts of Perth, Aberdeen, or Inverness, 
are richer in wide expanse of rolling flat and typical 
driving ground than many of the dales and fells of 
Cumberland, Westmoreland, or the North Riding. 

' Ah, but,' says one, ' my moor isn't like that ; you 



124 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

couldn't drive my ground, it is too steep.' This may 
be so, although he is probably mistaken j but it is 
impossible to know the particulars and comparative 
conditions of every moor in Scotland and England. . 
Nobody's knowledge would be sufficient for this ; one 
can only consider the general characteristics of a 
district. I only know that I have heard this sort of 
speech from men who rent shootings in a district 
where the conformation of the ground is far more 
favourable to driving than many a Yorkshire dale, 
and that merely looking from the train window on 
the Caledonian, the Glasgow and South-Western, 
ay, and on the Highland line, you will see miles 
upon miles of gentle slope and broad hill-face clothed 
in luxuriant heather which to a Yorkshire keeper's 
eye would look ideal ground for driving. 

The very inequalities of the moor, when properly 
turned to account in conjunction with the habitual 
flight of the birds, give opportunities which would not 
be detected by those unaccustomed to study ground 
as well as grouse with this object in view. Where 
the moor is very rocky, and the small ' knowes ' or 
knolls of heather are alternated with miniature preci- 
pices and ravines, furrowed and scored with the rush 
of melting snow, or swept bare by the plenteous 
volume of the summer spate, you will find the grouse 



SCOTCH DRIVING 125 

acquire habits peculiar to the class of ground, habits 
which, if you observe them, you can turn greatly to 
the advantage of your driving. They select rather 
bare and rocky spots for their alighting and sur veying 
places, and when disturbed from basking or feedi ng 
on lower and more sheltered ground they fly to these, 
and almost always by the same route, according to the 
wind. I have had a very fine drive with hardly a bit 
of heather near me, surrounded by frowning precipices 
and huge boulders, and sheltered by a butt formed ot 
the great stones scattered in profusion all over the 
upper slopes of the hill. 

Again, when grouse are pushed, as they often can 
be, across a deep ravine or narrow glen, soaring high 
over the low birch scrub and bracken, haunts of the 
black-game and the roe, you will see if you watch them 
carefully but very carefully that they only alight in 
certain spots on the opposite hill, or that, having a 
rough and rocky ridge to pass over, they invariably 
select certain passes or gullies to rush through to the 
same resting place. 

Here is your chance. Your batteries must be 
carefully placed just behind, not on the ridge, each 
one preferably in a slight hollow or pass rather than 
on a knoll, and you will be surprised at the result. 
Unlike the typical grouse ground as this spot may 



126 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

appear, and though you find no birds sitting on or 
near the butts as you approach them, yet as the far-off 
holloa of the drivers sounds more frequent, round the 
rocks they begin to come, swinging through the passes 
at a terrific pace with the wind, or beating slowly and 
heavily against it, seeming to grow mysteriously out of 
the rock in front, and vanishing like lightning over 
the grey knoll behind, yet always making for the same 
place, until you find by experience that, in proportion 
to the birds upon the moor, your rock or ravine drive 
is always one of the best and most certain. 

The march between two moors is, in Scotland, 
usually on the ridge or watershed, although you will 
often find it defined by a river or a road. Where it is 
on the ridge, the shooting will probably consist of both 
sides of some great glen, with the flat or rocky ground 
above the ' face,' stretching as far as the highest 
point of the watershed. Now, grouse are very loth to 
fly across a big valley, especially if it is cultivated, and 
should the distance from face to face cost them a 
flight of a mile or more they will hardly ever attempt 
it. I have seen a biggish pack of grouse start across 
a broad valley, where they would have had to go two or 
three miles before they could again alight upon heather, 
fly about half a mile, funk it, and turn back again to 
the hill they were disturbed on. Their inclination is 



SCOTCH DRIVING 127 



always to fly along the hill, and round the bottom or 
side of a knoll, whether great or small, rather than over 
or across it. It is very wonderful to see how they 
save themselves in their flight, especially when they 
are going against a heavy wind. Could you be along- 
side of them, and travelling with them, you would note 
the marvellous way in which they give themselves the 
benefit of the ground to escape rising into the wind, 
passing round all the excrescences and through all 
the depressions in the hillside, clinging close to the 
heather, but always manoeuvring, sidling, or creeping 
to reach the alighting place which they have in view. 

This characteristic will aid you greatly in the choice 
of the place for your line of butts, which, as everybody 
now knows, is the important factor in driving. The 
birds are not likely to leave the hillside on which 
you find them ; consequently you have only to study 
the routes they will take in flying along it. 

If the ground is so intersected by rocks, precipices, 
or deep gorges that your drivers cannot travel it at 
all at least, without consuming the whole day in one 
or two drives you may give it up ; but if your men 
(-an manage to get about the ground so as to give 
you, say, at least four or five drives in the day, there is 
nothing in the flight of the birds on steep ground 
that you may not turn to your advantage. 



128 . SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



One often meets with a drive in Scotland where 
the grouse and black-game come over the guns at such 
a height that no shot will reach them ; and you are 
told that this hill is impossible to drive, as the birds 
always do this ; nobody can kill them, and there is no 
result. This is a wrong conclusion. It merely means 
that the guns are not in the right place. These birds 
must touch the ground somewhere, and when you 
have found their point of contact with the earth, or 
alighting place, then you have found the spot where 
you can kill them. 

It is only with the wind or on a perfectly still day 
that they will trust themselves thus in mid-air, and 
then only under compulsion ; they will never attempt 
high flights against the wind. Great as is the power 
of their flight, and strong as their wings and tails are to 
steer by, they have as great a horror of being caught 
high up and rendered helpless by the wind as we 
should have of finding ourselves striking out in the 
rapid stream of a big river. 

Now make an experimental drive and you must 
make many such if you wish for successful permanent 
drives ; place a trustworthy man or two far away down 
wind on the hillside beyond where they come so high 
over you, and you will probably be agreeably surprised 
to find how easy is the solution of the problem. Your 



SCOTCH DRIVING 129 



watchers will tell you that every bird came as though 
out of the sky straight for a particular rock, or peak 
of high ground, and swinging round the point into the 
lee, alighted in the shelter. 

There you have the spot for your butts. Neither 
grouse nor, so far as I have ever seen, any other bird 
can pause and alight in his flight down wind without 
turning round and up into the wind to do it. They 
will seldom attempt this, and almost invariably drop 
into a sheltered spot where they can settle without 
fear of being dashed against the ground by the force 
of the wind. 

So much for your down-wind drives, which are, in 
spite of anything you may be told to the contrary, 
much the most difficult to manage on steep or high 
and precipitous ground. 

You will find it easy enough to push them back 
up wind, provided you attend to one or two essential 
points. The butts in this case must, as I remarked 
above, never be placed- along a ridge or sky-line, but 
just behind it, so as to give the guns about fifty to 
eighty yards in front of them to see the birds coming. 
I have never seen a successful drive where it was 
attempted to push birds up wind to butts on a ridge, 
though it can be done with the wind. Again, though 
it is a very pretty sight to observe the birds, at first 

K 



130 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

tiny specks afar off, and as they grow bigger to the 
eye to watch every detail of their long flight, speculating 
as to whether they will come to you or your neigh- 
bour, yet this is not the most killing condition. You 
will always observe that more birds are realised when 
everyone remarks that ' I couldn't see them till they 
were right on me,' than when they could watch them 
coming the whole way. Just room enough in front to 
be ready, select your bird, and get the gun up is all 
you want, and for this eighty yards from the butt to 
the ridge is amply sufficient. 

Then each butt must if possible be placed, though 
always adhering to the straight line, so as to command 
what I must describe as a pass that is, a hollow or 
comparatively flat space. I have seen on a sharply 
undulating ridge each one placed on the top of the 
knoll, with the passes or valleys between. The result 
of this is that the birds swerve a great deal, and some- 
times turn back, while the shots at birds bel<nv the 
gun as they pass through the- hollows are about the 
most difficult you can have. When placed in the 
hollows it will often be impossible to see your next- 
door neighbour, but in this case you have only to be 
careful that when your line of butts is made, a big 
stone, stake, or cairn is put up on the knoll in the 
exact line between the two butts. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 131 



It is absolutely essential that the Scotch keeper 
to whom driving is an unwelcome novelty should be 
made familiar with the aspect of the birds' flight from 
the butts. You must make him delegate the manage- 
ment of the drive to his next in command, and be 
with you in the butts at least once or twice at each 
particular drive, that he may see what happens. He 
will then be able to observe why it is that one or two 
butts have all the shooting, or why birds which come 
apparently well to the guns are at certain drives 
never properly realised ; he will see the difference in 
difficulty between birds creeping through a slack or 
pass straight towards you, and the same birds when 
you only command the slack from above, and have to 
point down at them at a sharp angle as they curve 
round beneath you. Again, he will understand why 
you, after some experience of this drive, possibly con- 
clude that by shifting the whole line of butts only a 
few yards you may convert a difficult killing place 
into an easy one. He will grasp the point, and be 
keen enough unless endowed with too great a share 
of Gaelic obstinacy, to reconstruct the line and watch 
the successful result. You must never be afraid to 
make new lines of butts or to shift old ones, nor 
permit your keeper to make any fuss over the question. 
Scotch keepers arc sometimes very troublesome on 

K 2 



132 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



this point ; they will not make butts themselves, but 
insist upon extra men being hired to do it. This 
should never be allowed. They have more than 
ample time during the months when there is no shoot- 
ing to do this, and the more they get to know about 
the construction and position of the butts the better, 
while the work involved is nothing but good for 
them. 

Highlanders are, as all the world knows, a very 
fine race of men, courageous and loyal, courteous and 
amiable, they make the best sportsmen and the best 
soldiers in the world ; but they are neither so practi- 
cal nor so energetic under ordinary conditions as the 
northern Englishman, and laziness is their great fail- 
ing. There is a great deal of work involved in erect- 
ing and maintaining several lines of butts, and it is 
necessary that the keepers should be kept up to doing 
this properly. They will soon learn that it is to their 
interest to do so, and that the visitor who is used to 
high -class driving, and possibly knows a great deal 
more of the management of a moor than they do, will 
be more liberally and generously inclined towards 
them if they thoroughly perform their manifest duty 
of keeping everything connected with the shooting in 
first-rate order. 

It is impossible to kill grouse well from a badly 



SCOTCH DRIVING 133 

constructed or ruined butt ; and the man who has to 
wait for three-quarters of an hour in cold and windy 
weather with his feet in three or four inches of sodden 
mud, peat, or water, unprotected from the blast or from 
the keen eyes of the approaching grouse save by dilapi- 
dated walls of sod, sunken to the level of his waist, 
trodden down by sheep or cattle, and never touched 
since they were carelessly erected a year or two before, 
is not likely to feel favourably disposed towards the 
keeper who has charge of these things. His only 
alternative is to scrape out the mud with his feet, 
thereby blocking the entrance to and the drainage 
from the butt, and to build up the front wall by taking 
sods from the back one, the result being to make the 
place still more comfortless and untenantable for the 
next comer on a succeeding day. 

Square butts are always to be recommended, es- 
pecially on high ground, and where sheep or cattle are 
pastured on the moor, as being much more permanent, 
while they afford welcome shelter in bad weather. The 
entrance should be at the side, and as narrow as pos- 
sible, so as to keep out the aforesaid animals. The 
walls should be built high, as remarked on in the fol- 
lowing chapter, and the measurements there given 
adhered to. 

Old birds on the high ground are very wary, as 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



well as very accomplished in their flight, and if they 
catch sight of you will swing away and often turn alto- 
gether from the line. These are exactly those which 
you should be most desirous to kill, and a well-made 
and commodious butt, in which you can keep well 
out of sight, is really most essential in the more remote 
drives, where birds are few and keen, than anywhere. 
Yet you often see in Scotland the error committed of 
taking less trouble over these than over the lines near 
the lodge and on lower ground, where the driving 
is easier. The second difficulty I named above 
viz. the opposition or unwillingness of many Scotch 
keepers has to be reckoned with in this department. 
They must be taught that these things are not fancies, 
nor mere aids to making the sport easy or luxurious, 
but absolute essentials of a successful drive, while the 
proper manner of carrying them out is the result of 
the experience of fifty or sixty years on the English 
moors. 

It is the same with the manner of conducting the 
drive. Many of my readers must have noticed how 
impossible it appears to persuade a line of Scotch 
drivers to preserve the proper horseshoe or half-moon 
shape, or that their flanks are really the most import- 
ant parts of their force. Instead of getting well round 
the ground, and no driver showing himself or beginning 



SCOTCH DRIVING 135 

to move until it is practically inclosed in a great half- 
circle, they drop carelessly, after going just a quarter 
of a mile short of where they should have gone to, 
into some sort of line, and then all come straight on, 
the centre often farther ahead than the flanks (!) and 
the birds, of course, pouring out on each side. It is 
a matter of luck that any birds come to the guns at 
all, a very poor bag is made, and then it is voted that 
driving doesn't really answer, and that you mustn't 
expect what they get in Yorkshire, &c. 

This can only be remedied, to my thinking, by 
the command of the drive being taken by some person 
who understands it, whether the host, or anyone else 
whom he may import to instruct the keepers and 
beaters. His authority must be absolute, and they 
must be brought to understand that successful driving 
is entirely a matter of discipline and organisation. 
The most excellent instruction as to drivers, forma- 
tion, flags, &c., has been set out in the Badminton 
Library, and in Payne-Gallwey's ' Letters to Young 
Shooters ; ' but when do you ever find it acted upon ? 

On the best known Yorkshire moors, where the 
system has been brought to perfection, all this instruc- 
tion is superfluous ; but why is it that in Scotland, 
where it is so much needed, you never find it followed 
out? The average owner or tenant buys these books, 



136 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

reads them, discusses and criticises them, and then 
puts them away on the shelf without ever making the 
experiment of thoroughly putting into practice what 
has been so carefully thought out and set down by 
men of such experience as the authors of those 
volumes. 

I can add hardly anything to what they have 
written, but I can at least point out that if they were 
less criticised or neglected, and more acted upon, 
grouse driving on the average Scotch moor would be 
far more profitable to the owner and pleasanter to 
his friends. 

The matter is new to the Scotchman, and he is 
inclined for various reasons, to be alluded to presently, 
to view it with little favour. But if he has to do it at 
all, he may just as well learn what remarkable results 
he may achieve by carrying it out systematically and 
properly. The new system must have a fair trial to 
be properly adopted or condemned. It is the head- 
keeper ivho must read the admin ton Library and 
master its details ; but how many keepers have ever 
had a serious book on shooting given to them by their 
masters, or enjoyed the chance of discussing such a 
work with anyone who understands it ? 

Take a simple instance like the colour of the flags. 
It has over and over again been urged that the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



137 



colour of the flags carried by the head man should 
be different in colour from those the drivers carry, the 
flank men, again, having a distinctive flag of some kind ; 
yet you usually see flags served out indiscriminately, 
and it is consequently impossible at a distance for 
either the shooters or the drivers to tell where the 
centre of the line or the flanks may be. This the 
drivers, at least, embracing as they sometimes do a 





FIG. i. 

mile and a half of line, ought to be able to do, and 
each one regulate his own pace and direction thereby. 
I would recommend white flags for the rank and 
file, and a red one for the head man or centre of the 
line, with red and white ones for the flankers and 
pointsmen. The white is the most visible on the 
moor, but the red and white ones, especially if made 
as in fig. 2, are very conspicuous, and therefore good 



138 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

for the flank men, while the solitary red one will be 
easily found in the centre of the line. 

Now, all these details are important, nay essential 
to success in driving. But if they are neglected, or 
obstinately combated by persons who have no know- 
ledge or not sufficient keenness to wish to realise the 
largest head of game that the ground is able to produce, 
then their grouse driving will always remain an unsatis- 
factory and haphazard performance, while every excuse 
except the real one will be advanced to account for 
the poor results achieved. 

To drive grouse unless they are driven properly 
I may say scientifically is a waste of time, money, 
energy, and temper ; and, as I have urged before, the 
detailed advice and instruction of initiated and expe- 
rienced authorities is far more necessary and useful to 
those who are taking it up under adverse or new condi- 
tions than to those who have studied it under more usual 
or favourable circumstances. Your horseshoe forma- 
tion, your good flanking and carefully placed butts, are 
far more necessary on a wild Scotch beat than on a flat 
and easily driven Yorkshire moor. Yet it is frequently 
made to appear as if all these things were considered 
immaterial by those who ought to study them most 
carefully, and would profit most by them. 

Now suppose the wind to be blowing directly 



SCOTCH DRIVING 139 

across the valley, and for I wish to take the most 
difficult instance rather against than with the course 
of the drive. Here your result depends entirely upon 
the disposal of the men and the conduct of the drive. 
You are driving along the face of a hill, and the cross- 
wind is blowing fairly strong from the ridge or crest of 
the hill downwards. The natural result of this will be, 
unless you manage properly, that birds flushed on the 
higher part of the face will be inclined to turn round 
and downwards, flying back high over the heads of the 
beaters. This is the danger to be guarded against. 
Once the birds have made up their terrified minds 
to do this they cannot be turned, neither could they 
turn themselves, with the strong breeze behind them, 
if they would. 

It therefore follows that this instinct of theirs must 
be guarded against from or before the start. The 
head man, with the red flag, starting from the centre 
1 joint and heading straight for the centre of the line 

1 O O 

of guns, will, instead of having seven men on each side 
of him (I am allowing fifteen drivers and pointsmen, 
all told), have five on the windward and nine on the 
leeward side. 

I have made a diagram, which I hope will convey 
what I mean. At the bottom of the hill is the burn 
running along a deep gully. The butts extend at the 



140 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



point chosen from the burn to the ridge, the highest 
No. 8, being just under or on the ridge, as experience 
shows to be best. The drive widens out into a corrie 
or flat at the beginning, in which lie a large proportion 
of the birds, taking advantage of its sheltered posi- 
tion. In this drive there will be no pointsman or flanker 
near the guns on the windward side, while on the lee- 
ward side five or six of the men will be pushed along 
the burn-side before the drive begins, the efforts of 
the pointsman, standing on the highest knoll he can 
find, being supplemented by the man with the ponies, 
who can always be utilised as a flag nearer the guns. 
It is of supreme importance that this formation should 
be completed before the driving begins, and it must 
be borne in mind that the upper drivers, on the wind- 
ward side, will, in addition to the wind, have the added 
power of showing against the sky to the birds below 
them. Their movements must, therefore, be cautious, 
and they must not get too far ahead or make them- 
selves too conspicuous, as they might if it were a still 
day or they had the wind in their favour. 

When the base or centre, A, of the drive begins to 
move, all the men on the leeward or burn-side must 
come into sight at once, and the aforesaid men on the 
windward flank must creep under, not on, the ridge to 
get round the sheltered corrie without going very far 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



:-r-v E 




142 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



ahead of the centre. All the birds in this corrie if 
flushed by men behind them will hang right along 
under the ridge in the shelter, describing a curve 
which the force of the wind will impose upon them, 
and coming well over the guns in order to reach the 
alighting ground they make for beyond the line of 
butts. 

Now, if this drive be mismanaged in the archaic 
manner I alluded to before that is, with all the drivers 
in a straight line nearly every bird in it will be lost, 
except a few lying at the bottom of the corrie, who may, 
if flushed luckily, hang on under the ridge and come to 
the upper guns. But most of them will never come 
to the guns at all ; those in the upper part of the 
corrie will, many of them, slip out at the head, and go 
up wind into the next valley or shelter. Those lower 
down will, most of them, feeling the force of the wind 
directly they rise, bear away over the burn and either 
remain on the other side beyond the stone wall, or 
curve in again if this ground is not moorland towards 
the alighting ground beyond the line of guns, without 
giving a shot. Many others, hearing the guns in 
front, and seeing nothing to stop them on the burn- 
side, will rise in the wind and go clean back towards 
the point B. The drive will consequently be an utter 
failure. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 143 

Again, if driven in the ordinary horseshoe shape, 
with both flanks equally forward, a lot of birds will be 
lost, still owing to the curve they will describe be- 
cause of the wind, at and between the points D and 
D. Besides this the flankers on the ridge side, espe- 
cially if showing strong against the sky, will turn back 
any birds which get up below and behind them, and 
these will again make away over the drivers' heads to 
the point R. The only birds which will come well to the 
guns will be those that rise in the middle, having 
caught sight of the burn-side flank and not seen the 
ridge flank. But the drive will not be a success, 
half the birds not having come forward to the guns, 
and what is worse, the next drive, in which these birds 
are counted on to make a still better one, will be 
spoilt also. 

In giving this illustration I have endeavoured to 
take an instance of a typical drive in a Scotch glen, 
and founded it not upon any one place in particular, 
but upon the common or usual characteristics of such 
ground. 

To drive the same piece with a cross-wind from 
the opposite direction that is, blowing up the hill is 
an easier matter, and I do not think requires a fresh 
diagram. The flankers along the burn-side need not 
lie so numerous or conspicuous, though this wing 



144 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

must still be pushed on a little. The general tendency 
of the birds in this wind will be either to creep across 
the wind and up the hill, or to turn back as before 
over the beaters, making their exit in this instance 
somewhere over the point A, instead of towards B. 
The flankers on the ridge side will this time be the 
important people, and will have more to do. They 
must push more forward than the other flank, and 
coming along over or above the ridge turn those birds 
which are inclined to go over gently on to the guns. 
This will not be difficult to do, provided they are 
stationed there in time, but as the birds are flying up- 
hill, and the wind slightly more against them than 
with them, it will be time enough to turn them after 
they have topped the ridge. This is the reason 
why they should, as I said, be themselves over or 
behind the ridge ; the birds will then swing down 
from them in a fresh curve and come over the upper 
guns, hanging a good deal in the breeze and giving 
easy shots. If the men came in full view along the 
ridge, they would turn a good many of these birds 
back over the centre A. 

In both these drives the butts numbered 4 to 
7 will probably have the most shooting, though as 
the lay of the ground varies in ..detail, as well as the 
points from which the birds have been flushed, so will 



SCOTCH DRIVING 145 



the curve described in the former drive vary also, and 
the lower guns may possibly be the most favoured. 

Now, in this drive I have depicted a sharp ridge 
on the upper, and a stout wall or boundary to the 
moor on the lower side. 

But without supposing any change in the shape or 
configuration of the ground, we may note a few altera- 
tions in the formation of the beaters which would 
become necessary if some of its characteristics were 
different. For instance, if instead of the sharp or 
rocky ridge you have a rounded shoulder, merely 
enlarging the area of good lying ground over the top 
and extending to a more or less flat district with good 
spaces of shelter probably ending at a march of 
watershed higher up ; in this case, unless too much 
raked by the wind, a good many birds will be lying on 
the upper flat, and some more on being flushed in ther 
corrie will be inclined to make up to it against the 
wind. 

What I have termed the ridge flank must there- 
fore be extended before the drive begins beyond 
the point E, and may want an additional man, who 
had better be spared from the other flank between A 
and i;. This flank must now take great care to get 
right round this upper ground, especially as most of 
the birds lying on it will probably be old ones, which 

L 



I 4 6 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

it should be your invariable object to kill if possible, 
and instead of coming along under the ridge as in 
the first instance suggested, take a wide circuit round 
from E to F and approach the guns in a direction 
about from F to G. By this means the drivers will rake 
in all the birds on the upper ground, and as they will be 
far enough over the shoulder not to show on the sky 
line, they will not turn back birds flushed below on 
the face. They must go warily, and the burn-side 
flank and centre must go slowly, to give them time 
to get cleverly round. 

Again, if on the lower side there is no stone wall 
or boundary to the moorland, but an expanse of 
equally good ground across the burn, it will be ne- 
cessary to extend the lower flank and sweep some 
of this ground in, always, however, keeping the flank 
extremely forward, practically joining on to the 
pointsman, on account of the wind. In this case the 
lower butts should get better shooting, and it may be 
well to have an extra butt across the burn in a line 
with where I have shown the ponies. 

In this diagram I have made curved lines showing 
the probable direction and curve of flight birds would 
take from where they are flushed to the alighting 
ground, those flushed very early in the drive in some 
instances settling at the points x. On rising again 



SCOTCH DRIVING 147 



these birds would be taken with the wind down to 
the lower guns, in the beginning of a new curve of 
flight to fresh alighting ground farther off. 

Now, the higher level of ground which I imagined 
above, and which is the most frequent accessory con- 
dition to a Scotch moor, embracing as it sometimes 
does a large part of the acreage of the shooting, on 
which there is little or no heather, but large expanses 
of grass varied with deep and barren peat bogs, and 
interspersed with rocks, caves, and gullies, yet not high 
enough to fairly reach the haunts of the ptarmigan, 
the eagle, and the fox the level, in short, that is 
known as 'the tops,' rather than the ' high tops ' is 
an important factor in Scotch driving, and from the 
point of view of improving your moor must be 
carefully considered. 

On these heights almost invariably throughout 
Scotland, but more especially where no driving has 
ever been systematically tried, abides a race of old 
grouse, of wary and predatory habits, amatory and 
pugnacious dispositions, evasive and exclusive conduct. 
Now, these old stagers it is of the utmost importance 
to destroy ; but to do so is no easy matter. It is my 
firm belief that the presence of these useless, and it is 
no exaggeration to say destructive, birds has a great 
deal to do with the scarcity of broods, and the low 



148 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

average of stock to be found on elevated Scotch 
shootings. It is well known that in deer forests, 
where the great object is to get rid of grouse, the best 
means to arrive at this end is to leave them alone 
altogether. The result is that in a great measure they 
die out ; at any rate, their numbers dwindle to the 
lowest possible point. There are two reasons for 
this : one that the race becomes vitiated and reduced 
by in-breeding, the other that the older birds interfere 
with the matrimonial arrangements of the younger, to 
the prejudice of the offspring. 

The latter evil prevails more than the former 
among the birds I have mentioned as inhabiting the 
higher portions of Scotch shootings. In the pairing 
season the old warriors come down from the heights, 
fight with and vanquish the younger ones, and absorb 
the young hens ; the latter lay nests full of eggs, but 
they are sterile ; while the more youthful and capable 
cock bird, who would become the parent of a healthy 
brood, is either driven off the ground altogether or 
obliged to remain in a state of combative celibacy. 
The old hens also, who are beyond the age of laying, 
attack any young hen who may nest near them, driving 
her off her nest, thus causing the eggs to get cold and 
the incubation to be abortive. 

The old barren hens are bad enough, but the old 



SCOTCH DRIVING 149 

cocks arc the worst, and both must by some means 
or other be destroyed. You would never dream of 
keeping birds of this age in a poultry yard for 
profit, where the inevitable test of /. s. d. forces you 
to be practical. Why should you allow this loss of 
stock on your grouse moor? We must therefore 
condemn them ; but how is the sentence of death to 
be carried out ? It is not easy. The nature of the 
ground they frequent in the shooting season, and 
their alert and wily habits, sentinelled as they are 
during their baskings and feedings, tortuous and swift 
as is their flight, are ample protection against the 
ordinary methods of the average shooter, keeper, and 
brace of dogs. I would rather poison them than 
have them on my own ground, and on expressing this 
revolutionary idea to a friend of mine, one of the best 
known living authorities on such subjects, I was 
delighted to hear him cordially assent. 

But as I have not studied the Korgian method, 
and am not therefore in a position to actually recom- 
mend it, I will confine myself to other and more 
practicable means. These birds could be immensely 
reduced in numbers, if not decimated, by indefatig- 
able stalking ; but this would consume an immense 
amount of time, involve constant disturbance of the 
other birds on the ground, and entirely engross the 



150 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



keepers' energies. The only method left is, therefore, 
to drive them. 

I have already observed that the average shooter, 
endeavouring to secure them in the ordinary way with 
pointers, would find them more than his match ; 
indeed, he would kill very few of them. I will go 
farther he would probably never see most of them, 
unless he were a very first-rate, keen-eyed, and active 
sportsman, and devoted much time, instead of dele- 
gating this to his keeper, to sneaking quietly up the 
gullies, and taking advantage of inequalities in the 
ground to creep upon them unawares. This method 
is often practised in the latter part of the season in 
Yorkshire, under the name of ' gruffing,' from the local 
term 'gruff,' signifying the little deep gullies in the 
moor along which the grouse stalker manoeuvres, and 
is very good fun. But as I have remarked, this takes 
so much time that it could only be effectively practised 
by those who reside all through the season close to 
their own moors. For the average grouse shooter who 
resides in the low country, and only visits the moor- 
land from August to October, it is not practicable to 
any effective extent. 

There is but one way for the sportsman to drive 
these birds. The average Scotch keeper does not 
believe that the stock of birds on his moor in a trood 



SCO TCH DRIVING 1 5 1 



breeding season could be increased. I must beg to 
differ from him. He does not, as a rule, even know 
how many he has on the ground ; and the aforesaid 
packs of very old birds on the higher ground are to 
him a mysterious, unknown, and inaccessible quantity, 
He may walk all over the tops, with dogs or without, 
but unless he creeps and crouches like a stalker, and 
studies the instinct of the birds which causes them 
always to lie in the leeward or sheltered sides of the 
hills or knowes, peeping, with half his face and the 
whole of his body hidden, over the brows, and ad- 
vancing with noiseless tread, he will not even catch 
sight of these wary old fowl. Nothing will fairly show 
you what stock of grouse you have upon a moor except 
driving it ; and unless you drive the whole of it, 
especially late in the season, you can never be sure 
what is the quantity of birds left behind or outside 
your drives which you may not have seen. If you 
are petermined, whatever your conditions, to kill the 
majority of your birds over dogs, you still ought to 
drive the tops, and do what you can to reduce the 
regiments of antique fowls which inhabit them You 
are not asked to eat them ; they will do to send to 
your friends (?), or to swell the market which supplies 
the suburban taste for game through the medium of 
third-rate restaurants ; but kill them if you can. 



152 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



On a Yorkshire moor you are driving on the tops 
all the time. If there is a high point on the moor, 
rocky and precipitous, it is in extent probably a mere 
fraction compared with the acreage of good moorland 
around it. On a Scotch moor you have usually a 
large acreage above the line of your highest driving 
ground, but you rarely, if ever, see the tops driven. 
The two accompanying sketches may help to suggest 
the difference of conditions to the eye. In fig. 4, 
' Yorkshire,' you have a supposed rough outline of 
an extent of moorland, the horizontal line showing 
(in both drawings) the highest level reached by your 
drivers. In fig. 5, ' Scotland,' you will observe that 
as you only drive along the hill-faces where the heather 
is good, this line lies below a large tract which I have 
marked as ' tops,' dominated at the back by the 
ptarmigan hills or deer ground. It is the birds on 
the 'tops' that must either be absorbed into your 
usual drives by extended manoeuvres, or made the 
subject of special drives on intermediate days, with 
extra lines of butts for the purpose. 

To my thinking, much more could be done than 
is usually attempted by the former method. I would 
suggest that the drivers should be on the ground a 
long time before the guns are in position, and should 
sweep across the tops, driving all upon them on to the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 



153 




154 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

lower ground, before they form line for the individual 
drives. Two men at least more if available should 
then be told off who would keep on the high ground 
all day, always walking across it, keeping the birds 
from finding refuge there, and constantly pushing 
them on to the lower faces. This would be a very 
effective method, and I have never taken part in driv- 
ing on a Scotch moor, whether in Aberdeenshire in 
the palmy days of 1872, or on a west-coast shooting 
in more recent and inferior seasons, without feeling 
that the ground, without some such manoeuvre as this, 
was not being properly covered, and that the birds 
had a shade the best of the contest. 

Late in the season the birds all over the ground 
will pack, and unless you can get at these packs and 
break them up your sport is poor ; they will after 
they have been driven a few times betake themselves 
bodily to the tops, leaving you with nothing but a 
few stragglers all young birds to make your bag 
from. 

Not having a moor of my own, and feeling, there- 
fore, that in spite of varied experience on other 
people's ground I am still liable to the criticism of those 
who own moors, and who might think that my remarks 
are not practical or applicable to their particular cases, 
I have been at the pains to obtain an exhaustive 



SCOTCH DRIVING 155 



account of what has taken place on the moor which, 
up to now, has beaten all the records in Scotland. I 
allude to the estate of the Mackintosh at Moy Hall, 
Inverness. This gentleman has been kind enough to 
send me a very exact record of the progress of his 
moor from the days when no driving was done until 
the present time, when he finds himself able to rival 
the records of most of the English moors with very few 
exceptions. My readers will, no doubt, find it difficult 
to believe that I have not founded what I have written 
above upon the account which the Mackintosh has 
been good enough to send me. I can only, therefore, 
give them my word that I have not the pleasure of 
knowing that gentleman, that I have never set foot 
upon the Moy Hall moors, and that all the foregoing 
pages, in which I have endeavoured to show how the re- 
sults of Scotch moorland could be improved by driving, 
were written before receiving this admirable paper. I 
may, perhaps, be allowed to say how gratified I feel 
to find that the Mackintosh's narrative of experience 
so closely corroborates what I have urged myself. 
The matter which he has sent me, and for which I 
cannot sufficiently express my gratitude, is so excellent 
and practical that I think I cannot do better than 
print it in 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



Moy Hall, Inverness : November 30, 1893. 
This moor contains about 11,000 acres, and lies in 
Strathdearn, in the valley of the river Findhorn, at an 
altitude of 1,100 feet above sea-level. It is nearly 
square in shape, and the surface is undulating and 
pretty smooth. It is very well watered by springs 
and burns, and lies to the sun. As it has been in the 
proprietor's own hands since 1878, the heather is well 
burned all over the ground a matter of vital import- 
ance in keeping up a large stock and insuring healthy 
birds. Too many moors are well burned in parts only, 
generally near burns, and the other beats neglected. 
Good burning can only be done on the high ground 
in exceptional years, and only then for a very short 
time, so that it is all-important to put on a large force 
of men to do this when the chance can be got. 
Little patches, but very frequent, should be the rule. 
This spreads the birds more, and prevents old birds 
from driving the younger birds off the strips when 
they are feeding. Then again, every care should be 
taken to make as much as possible of the water on the 
moor, Every trickle of water should be puddled 
up, and a succession of small drinking places made. 
Nothing can be worse in a dry rearing season than 
to have all the birds crammed together in one or two 
places. In fact, as in modern warfare, the spade has 



SCOTCH DRIVING 157 



as much to do with obtaining good results as the gun 
has. What with looking after the springs, altering 
and repairing the butts, the spade is not out of the 
keepers' and watchers' hands from April till August. 
Another matter of vital importance is the killing down 
of old cocks. These worst of vermin can always be 
killed in November in certain favourite places. Every 
old cock killed then is worth a good many eggs in the 
following spring. The head keeper alone should be 
entrusted with this work, however. On too many 
Highland moors not nearly enough trapping is done 
for the smaller vermin, such as stoats and weasels. 
The traps should be left standing so long as they can 
spring. 

In the opinion of the writer the cause of there 
having been so many disappointing seasons on a great 
many moors of late years is because what should be 
the breeding birds are killed early in August, and 
gradually a worse and worse class of bird is left. 
Grouse in many places have not laid the large number 
of eggs they used to go, even though the seasons for 
nesting have been very good. The large shootings 
which existed, say, in the Seventies have been broken 
up into smaller ones, roads and paths made to the 
distant beats, and as nowadays everyone shoots 
'pretty well, 1 too often the old birds escape and the 



158 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

young birds are bagged. Especially is this the case 
with moors which are let from season to season, and 
nowadays the new class of shooting tenant does not 
much care about a lease. To give these moors a 
chance they should either be let on lease for a limit 
of birds, or else rested for a season, and then judi- 
ciously shot over. Where the moor is in the owner's 
hands or let on a long lease the case is different. If 
a man is very fond of dogs, pointers and setters, by 
all means let him use them; but if he wants to give 
the greatest amount of pleasure to the largest number 
of his friends, then let him harden his heart and make 
his moor into a 'driving moor,' not shooting over 
dogs at all, except perhaps in some odd corner or 
two. He can really get far more pleasure, and profit 
as well, if he sees his dogs broken himself before the 
shooting season, and then sells them to the public or 
to such of his friends as wish to shoot over dogs. 
There can be no manner of doubt that, once dogs are 
given up and regular and systematic driving taken 
to, the stock of birds is doubled or trebled, and, better 
still, the average healthiness of the birds is raised. 
This can easily be seen if there is a ' driving moor ' 
next to a moor which is ' dogged.' On the Moy Hall 
moor there has been practically no disease since 

1873- 



SCOTCH DRIVING 159 



Driving was first resorted to in 1869, and only 
then when the birds were too wild to sit to dogs. On 
September 8, 1869, the entry is ' We drove the birds ; ' 
the result for two guns was twelve grouse not much, 
but a beginning. The next mention is on August 30, 
1870, when, with four guns, forty-two grouse were 
got by driving; and there are two other days in that 
year when the same number of guns shot twenty-seven 
and thirty-four birds. No attempt was then made to 
go over the main part of the moor. Driving was 
only resorted to on the flats and round the cornfields. 
Of course no butts were at that time erected. In 1871 
four guns got by driving 60, 57, and 121 grouse. 
On September 15, when the 121 grouse were got, the 
entry is, ' Everything went well ; we got fifteen brace 
at one drive, and eighteen brace at another.' 

In 1872 there is the first entry of the individual 
scores of the guns. Twenty-nine birds was the highest 
score. In the years of 1871 and 1872 the total num- 
ber of grouse killed during the season was 2,836 and 
3,002 (birds). 

From 1876 to 1879, owing to the moor being let, 
no driving was done. In 1879 this form of sport 
was regularly taken up: and on September i, 103 
grouse were killed in six drives. The highest score 
at one drive was thirteen birds for forty-three shots. 



160 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



During this season there were fourteen days of 
driving ; the best day of the season on Moy Hall 
was 162 grouse. On the adjoining moor of Meal- 
burne, belonging to the Mackintosh, on September 
10, 270 grouse were killed in one day's driving by 
ten guns. This moor is peculiarly suited for this 
kind of sport, and up to date of 1893 the largest 
one-day's bag in Scotland, 454 brace, was got by nine 
guns. During 1879 the bag at Moy Hall was 5,172 
grouse, showing how much the driving had done to 
secure birds which would otherwise never have come 
to the gun. On September 13, 1883, the first record 
of over one hundred brace for one day was got, 255 
birds being bagged by eight guns. During three suc- 
cessive days 540 grouse were got, or an average 
of ninety brace per diem. In 1884 an average of 
ninety-four brace was got for the first four days' 
driving, the best day being 256 grouse, and thirty 
birds being the highest score at one drive. 

In 1885, in the first four days' driving 52 7^ brace 
were killed. 

In 1886 the first four days' driving resulted in 
580 brace. 

In 1887, owing to the death of the late Lord 
Lovat when actually engaged in a day's sport, there 
was no shooting until September 19, when 1,608 



SCO'FCH DRIVING 161 



grouse were killed in three days, or an average for 
three successive days of 263 brace. One gun killed 
no less than eighty-two birds in one ' single drive ' 
on September 20, and had he been shooting with 
three guns would have got many more. His total 
bag for the same day was 143 grouse. The best 
drive of the day was 271 grouse. 

In 1888, during four days' successive driving, an 
average of 323 brace per diem was killed. During 
this season, which was a very good one, 5,822 grouse 
were killed on the moor. 

In J 889, an indifferent breeding season, four days' 
driving gave 777 brace. In this year grouse were 
shot over dogs for the last time. Up till that time 
the moor had been regularly shot over dogs until the 
end of August. 

In 1890 the first three or four days' driving re- 
sulted in 744 brace. 

In 1891 864 brace were got in four days, but 
there was much more shooting, as 1,806 brace were 
got in the season. 

In 1892, on September i, nine guns got 57^ 
grouse, and on the 2nd 803 grouse, the other two 
days of that week being so wild and stormy that 
there was no shooting. 

In 1893 2,642 grouse were killed by nine guns in 

M 



1 62 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



the first four days' driving, an average of 330 brace 
per diem. The best individual score for one day was 
184 grouse. There were six drives each day, and 
had the weather only been a little better, the results 
would have been much higher. 4,480 grouse were 
secured this season, all, of course, by driving. 

The writer considers that since 1888 there has 
been nothing like a brilliant season. This past season 
the birds have been healthier and better scattered 
than they have ever been. 

The great secret of success in driving is to select 
those places in the flight of the birds where they can 
best be killed. In Scotland this is far more difficult 
than in England, and no double drives, to give good 
results, are possible where the ground slopes, however 
gently. It is only on a dead level where a double 
drive is much good. The writer is all in favour of 
' massing ' the guns, and making the birds fly as con- 
centrated as possible In some of the drives the 
butts are only fifteen yards apart, and in none more 
than forty-five yards. All the butts should be (i) in 
a dead straight line, (2) should be close together and 
well concealed, being invariably placed within gun- 
shot of a ridge in front when on a hillside, and, if on 
a flat, then the outside turf should be carefully placed 
at the front of the butt. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 163 



The writer is all against upright, built-up butts. 
These must be dark-looking, and the birds ' shy ' at 
them, without the least doubt. 

The butts should be half sunk, well drained, and 
perfectly invisible from the front. 

For driving, about thirty beaters and six side 
boys are used. Only single drives are taken, as the 
distances taken in are very large in some drives 
about three miles round the arc of the beaters. Not 
a word is allowed to be said, except by the head 
keeper, who is always in the centre of the beaters. 
The six side boys are placed in ' pegged-out ' posi- 
tions, and only use their flags on the down-wind side. 

Some of the drives are very peculiar. In the 'Top 
of the Delta,' which is about the best on the moor, 
the grouse are driven to the end of a sloping hill, and 
parallel, and not at right angles to the butts. ]>y 
this way as many birds are shot coming from behind 
the right rear of the butts as from the direct front. 
The butts at this drive are very close to each other, 
and the bags made at it are large 350 birds, for 
instance. 

In another drive, 'The Rocks,' the birds are 
driven at first entirely away to the left of the line of 
butts, and at least half a mile to their left. '\Yhen 
once congregated on a certain flat, they are then 

M 2 



1 64 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



' dribbled ' round a gentle slope at one side of this 
flat, the beaters hardly moving, but every one or two 
men moving from time to time as the firing mode- 
rates. 

In fact, the more ' dodgy ' a drive can be made, 
the more sport there is in seeing it done. Many of 
the writer's friends, who shot regularly on English 
and Lowland moors, describe the birds in the High- 
lands as being much harder to shoot. This, of 
course, is owing to the ground. In some drives 
birds come perfectly straight, either low, highish, or 
very high ; in others, on the same day and with the 
same wind, they will fly like snipe, with a wrench and 
twist which sadly upsets 'averages.' 

As regards scoring, the writer considers that the 
best fairest, and quickest way is to draw for butts, 
shift two each drive, and ask each gun after each 
drive is over, ' How many birds did you see fall to 
your gun?' In these days of nitro powders everyone 
can see if he kills or not. If he does not know whether 
he has killed or not, he had better give up grouse 
driving. The total of that drive is then given to 
the gathering keeper, who then has some idea of 
what was claimed and what was picked up. As the 
drives are all single drives, birds are easily gathered 
by the guns, and after they have left to go on to the 



SCOTCH DRIVING 165 



next line, the ground is well hunted, and far back, by 
a keeper. Not a shot is allowed to be fired except 
during a drive. Walking in line and shooting home, 
as is often done, does really more harm in frightening 
birds than any amount of driving. 

The shooting at Moy Hall, in a fairly good year, 
is as follows : 

First week, about third week in August ; second 
week (after one week's rest only more is useless), 
about first week of September these of four days 
each; another two days about September 21, and 
another two days about last of October. These last 
are, of course, 'sandwiched in ' with other kinds of 
shooting. The man who will kill most at his moor 
by driving will be he who (i) gets good guns to shoot 
his birds ; (2) who disturbs his moor least by small 
days or stray guns being enlarged upon it ; (3) who is 
constantly on the look-out for fresh hints given by the 
birds themselves. 

(Signed) A. MACKINTOSH OF MACKINTOSH. 

With most of the above I cordially agree ; in fact, 
the experience of so close a student and excellent a 
sportsman could not, for his particular ground, be 
improved upon. 1 cannot quite endorse what he- 
says about built-up butts, having seen them work so 



1 66 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



well for a considerable succession of days. But even 
on this point one should, in considering individual 
moors, be open to conviction, and my solution of it 
would be that where on wild or rough ground such 
long drives are taken as are here mentioned, birds 
would be brought off their own ground entirely, and 
coming suddenly upon butts which they have never 
seen, would be likely to shy at them. At any rate first- 
rate sport has often been seen from both kinds, and so 
long as the sunken butts can be well drained I think 
there is a good deal to be said for them. 

Placing the guns so close as is advocated here 
seems to me to have disadvantages which on some 
moors would outweigh its advantages. Under any 
circumstances to concentrate the birds within so small 
a space is quite beyond the efforts of most Scotch 
keepers and drivers, although I admit that when once 
a perfect system has been established, such as obtains 
in Yorkshire, it would in some places be of great use 
to the bag. But in most Scotch drives the flight of 
the birds spreads over a wide space, requiring six or 
seven guns to cover it, and in such cases the flanks 
are sometimes as good as the centre. Again, having 
neighbours only fifteen yards off on each side of you 
would bother many people, besides destroying the 
feeling that you are free to shoot at any bird that 



SCOTCH DRIVING 167 

comes within range, which constitutes one of the most 
attractive features of grouse driving. 

The opposition of the keepers is, as mentioned 
above, a serious drawback to the success of driving in 
some parts of Scotland. With regard to this it seems 
to me necessary, while making allowance for the tra- 
ditions under which they have been brought up, 
and their dislike of change, not to lose sight of cer- 
tain interested motives which generally underlie their 
hostility to the new system. Scotchmen, though as a 
majority they vote on the Radical side, are by instinct 
the most conservative of highly civilised races. Their 
laws and customs, language and dress, show the tena- 
city with which they cling to the traditions of an 
ancestry of which any nation might be proud, and 
a gathering of the clans would to this day evoke a 
response which probably no cry could raise in any 
other country. 

In the training and management of dogs the 
Highlander has always shown himself to be particu- 
larly apt. He seems in some degree to share the 
keen instincts and finer qualities of the dog, and the 
devotion of the animal appears to bring out the gentler 
and more sympathetic side of the nature of the man. 
The pointer and setter, no less than the collie, the 
deerhound, or the ' dandy,' respond more faithfully 



168 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

on the average to the handling of a Scotchman than 
of his English counterpart. The best dog-breakers I 
have ever seen have been Scotchmen, and one cannot 
but admire their reluctance to abandon an art in 
which they excel for what is to them a more irksome 
and laborious manner of providing sport for their 
employers. 

But while we may and ought to sympathise with 
their genuine devotion to the dog, as well as the 
honest and painstaking assiduity which they bestow 
on the development of his qualities, we need not be 
blind to the fact that there is in the large majority of 
cases the interested motive which I mentioned above. 
They many of them think more of the bawbees than 
of sport, and fear they may lose under the new regime 
a source of profit which they enjoyed under the old. It 
pays very well to breed pointers and setters at some one 
else's expense and sell them for your own profit. The 
kennel of a Scotch shooting tenant is usually a heavy 
item of outlay to him, but in most cases a profitable 
business to his keeper. It is the fear lest they should 
lose this which influences most of them, and causes 
them to take refuge in the unworthy course of advis- 
ing their masters that driving is impossible on the 
moor, that they cannot get men, or that they will 
drive all the birds off the ground or kill too many 



SCOTCH DRIVING 169 



of them. Now, since this source of income to keepers, 
though not over honest in its source, has been, so to 
speak, legalised by the custom of two or three genera- 
tions, it seems to me both wise and right to com- 
pensate them to some extent if for your own pleasure 
or profit you do away with it. The obvious and best 
solution, unless you are prepared to raise their rate 
of wages, is to encourage them to breed and train re- 
trievers, with a few spaniels or setters. Good retrievers 
are very scarce and fetch high values ; most grouse 
driving is deficient in interest as well as in result, to 
those who are fond of hunting dogs, for lack of them. 
The same keeper who has for years maintained a 
high-class kennel of pointers will soon take an equal 
pride in his retrievers ; and a couple or two of setters 
should still be kept for wild days on outside beats, or 
to assist in finding birds after the big drives. 

The dog-man, whom I have urgently recommended 
as a necessary ally in partridge shooting, is equally if 
not more necessary to well-conducted grouse driving. 
To him should be confided the task of finding all the 
dead or ' pricked ' birds which fall wide of the line of 
butts or far behind, and it should be his business to 
remove all excuse for the apparently innocent, but 
usually crafty, marauding to which some of our friends 
resort to supplement their bag. 



170 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

The third difficulty, that of getting enough men 
to drive, is in some places insuperable. But here 
we must remember that, as in the case of the kennel 
question, liberality will do a great deal. A frequent 
evil to be found in Scotland is that the shooting 
tenant, having given a rent out of all proportion to 
the value of his moor, becomes stingy in other matters 
to recoup himself for his bad bargain, and so between 
the two conditions he gets less and less sport as time 
goes on. 

As I have urged in another volume, 1 liberality to 
all concerned is an essential condition of a pursuit of 
pleasure such as shooting, and I have always noticed 
that those who exercise this quality judiciously but 
freely, and combine with it a firm and kindly discipline, 
get the best sport. This is eminently the case in 
Scotland, where the people, specially responsive in 
nature, will be grateful to you for the one and admire 
you for the other. 

Good wages, a hearty lunch, and a brake or other 
conveyance for drivers who have to come far from 
their homes, I have seen work wonders ; while with 
the contrary conditions I have witnessed a general 
mutiny, and more often a sulky recalcitrant spirit, 
which, carried into practical effect all day, has entirely 
' The Partridge. 



SCOTCH DRIVING 171 

spoilt the sport. Where labour is scarce and drivers 
difficult to get, it becomes the more necessary to train 
the few you have to intelligent driving. It is wonder- 
ful what can be done with a small number by taking 
shorter drives, and teaching the men to cross about 
that is, while keeping their relative positions in the 
line, to zigzag so as not to miss the likely bits of hold- 
ing cover. 

To sum up, I commend the study of driving to 
those who rent or own Scotch shootings, feeling sure 
that if by any of the means I have tried to indicate 
they can infuse a keenness for it into the people they 
have to deal with, commanded and directed by superior 
practical knowledge, they will be much gratified if not 
astonished by the result. 



172 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



CHAPTER IV 

ENGLISH DRIVING 

SOME twenty years ago Messrs. Blackwood did me 
the honour to publish in their well-known magazine 
an article I had written on grouse driving ; a subject 
of which I had considerable experience during the 
remarkable seasons of 1870-1871, and above all 
1872. 

In it I tried to portray grouse driving as it was, 
and is still, on English moors, and to defend and 
recommend it as a system alike the most attractive to 
the sportsman and profitable to the stock of grouse. 
Many letters followed my little effort, and one gentle- 
man, who disguised his identity of which I am still 
ignorant under the signature of ' W. C.,' fell foul of 
the advocates of driving, and of myself in particular, 
in the columns of the ' Field/ with all the artillery of 
envy, malice and uncharitableness, supplemented by 
an ignorance of the subject that was remarkable even 
among journalistic contributions to sporting literature. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 173 



Sentiment against this ' inhuman butchery ' so 
overcame Mr. ' W. C.' that his feelings found vent in 
poetry, and the lines in which he may be supposed 
to have summed up his peculiar views on the matter 
are really worth reproducing, if only as evidence of 
his literary power and sporting instincts : 

Let gay ones and great 
Make the most of their fate 

As from mantlet to mantlet they run ; 
I envy them not - 
No, not a jot, 

If you give me my dog and my gun, 

I should have been concerned to see, even at that 
date, anyone who elected to run from ' mantlet to 
mantlet ' during a grouse drive, and the light of sub- 
sequent experience only tends to confirm the view 
which I held then, that a dog and a gun are almost as 
useful to a sportsman engaged in that pursuit as in any 
other, and none the less if, as appears to have happened 
to the fortunate ' W. C.,' they have been given to him. 
Mr. ' W. C.' finally crushed me with the remark that 
I was evidently more familiar with the pen than the 
gun. a compliment I enjoyed the more as I had 
never written anything for publication before, and had 
used a gun ever since I was strong enough to carry it. 

It is no longer necessary to defend grouse driving 
against this kind of onslaught, even when emanating 



174 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

from sopowerfula source as ' W. C.,' butthis gentleman 
was only one of many who always attacked anything 
like well-organised shooting or large bags, partly be- 
cause they had no knowledge of such things, and 
partly because at that time they furnished almost the 
only ' copy ' which editors of journals could procure 
on shooting matters. 

Nowadays all the best performances and records 
are pretty well known, most of them having been 
published in books or newspapers, and I think the 
Badminton Library has finally silenced the class of 
criticism so ably represented by my friend ' W. C.' 

The journey to the English moors, picturesque as 
it is, has details of a different character from those 
described in a previous chapter ; and what is a very 
important fact, the travellers are much more numer- 
ously recruited from local sources. 

The Manchester man and the Sheffielder, the 
dalesman and the tyke, are devoted to their grouse 
driving, and as proud as possible of the great bags that 
have made their moors so famous ; while their love 
of the sport is largely shared by the lower classes in 
the North of England. Herein lies the great difference 
between English and Scotch driving, as well as the 
secret of much of the superiority of the former over 
the latter. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 175 

It takes a great deal to astonish a Yorkshireman ; 
this is one of his most distinctive attributes ; and if 
any competent Yorkshire authority such as Lord 
Walsingham or Mr. Rimington- Wilson told a man of 
York that an effort to kill 2,000 brace in one day was 
contemplated, he would be delighted, not surprised at 
the idea, and only ask for the privilege of helping to 
do it. There is therefore no difficulty about obtaining 
drivers, and those of the most willing sort. Many of 
them will be glad to help without any payment, and 
the older hands among them will have besides a 
complete knowledge of the mysteries of flanking, wind, 
c\:c., a shrewd judgment of the comparative merits of 
the shooters engaged, and often a wager on the 
probable scores of their favourite champions. Last 
but not least, if the head keeper is a good man, 
they have implicit confidence in, and great respect 
for, him and his prowess ; and as a consequence 
he can keep them all under discipline, and turn 
them all to account in the management of his 
birds. 

It will readily be seen what an important factor 
lliis spirit among the inhabitants becomes towards the 
success of those great days on the more renowned 
moors, which seem to provide an ever-recurring sense 
of wonderment even to those who have often taken 



176 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

part in them, and to be absolutely incomprehensible 
to those who have not. 

Many a time, in other parts of England or in 
Scotland, have I felt that it would be wiser to be silent 
concerning these phenomenal deeds, and that my 
character for veracity or honesty would never survive 
the relation of even half what I had often seen. I 
have never forgotten a les*son I received when, as 
a youth at a private tutor's in Oxfordshire, I used 
to be asked to take a laborious part in the slaying 
of from ten to twenty brace of partridges in the com- 
pany of seven or eight old farmers. I had returned 
to my tutor's after the summer holidays, during 
which I had been fortunate enough to be allowed 
to take a gun in a day or two's grouse driving on 
the moors of Mr. Walter Stanhope at Dunford 
Bridge. When the Oxfordshire farmers asked me 
where I had been, I said ' grouse driving.' This con- 
veyed very little to them, but one of them lazily asked 
what sort of a bag we had made. I naively replied 
the truth, from 150 to 170 brace each day. We had 
just finished lunch, and our morning's bag of 7^ brace 
of partridges and a hare was proudly laid out near us. 
But this reply of mine cast a gloom over everything, 
and one of these sandy-haired, beefy-faced veterans 
laid his hand on my shoulder and said, ' Ah, young 



ENGLISH DRIVING 177 



man, when you be older, you'll know better than to 
tell such tales as that to a lot of men.' 

Many years after, a servant of mine, a veteran of 
the navy and the Taku forts, and afterwards of the 
London Fire Brigade, had to fight for his life in a 
Scotch lodge because he had incautiously related, and 
on this occasion quite truthfully, the results of a week 
at High Force, where he had just been with me, and 
where we had averaged 600 brace a day for four days. 
Previously nettled by his disparagement of Scotch 
moors as compared with English, the local champion, 
who happened to be the coachman, was fairly roused 

by this astounding record. ' Ye're a d d leear,' 

he cried, and fell upon the Southron. They were 
separated, but not until Flodden and Bannockburn 
had been fought over again, and the gun-room floor 
was covered with blood. 

These things are more widely known now, but I 
misdoubt me that many a Scotch keeper who listens 
with open-mouthed gravity to the tales of Studley and 
High Force, Broomhead or Wemmergill, conceals 
under the politeness of the Highlander an incredulity 
which cannot be shaken, and which deters him for ever 
from any effort to emulate such fabulous achievements, 
or eclipse the respectable moderation of the records 
of his own glen. 

X 



1 78 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

Although the opposition . to driving mentioned 
above is now out of date, there are still many people 
to whom the mere making of a large bag appears to 
constitute a source of irritation. I have never been 
quite able to understand this frame of mind. There 
is nothing to prevent such a man from making a small 
bag if he wishes it, either on his own or his friend's 
ground, and surely he might remember that those 
who take part in these (to him) colossal days are, for 
the most part, just as keen and accomplished sports- 
men as himself. From the days of the great Hawker 
until the present time, all the evidence tends to show 
that when a man is once out with a gun he will in- 
variably kill as much as he can. The man who will 
come home early in the day for fear that he should 
kill too much game is a person whom, at any rate, 
I have never met, and in whose existence, I must 
confess, I find it difficult to believe. But there is 
one point of view on which I should probably agree 
even with the unrelenting opponents of large bags. 
I do not think it desirable for boys or youths to take 
part in them until they have been properly trained to 
the contest between themselves and the animal they 
are pursuing, which constitutes the true definition of 
sport. A boy who is learning to shoot may be taken 
out grouse driving once in a way, but it is far better 



ENGLISH DRIVING 



that he should serve his apprenticeship in the pursuit 
of grouse by walking, stalking, or shooting them over 
dogs in the usual manner. When they are very wild 
he will, no doubt, if left to himself, organise little im- 
promptu drives with the few men who may be out 
with him, and in the course of a windy day he will 
get many shots which will teach him something of 
the calculation necessary to kill a driven bird. To 
partake in the pleasure of a well-organised shoot which 
produces a large total is not necessary to human hap- 
piness, however keen a shooter a man may be, but 
it is one of the delightfully exciting incidents of one's 
life ; and if the moor, manor, or covert produces 
naturally a large stock of game without doing harm 
to any individual, it is surely better to realise from it 
to the proper extent. This result will not be achieved", 
as I mentioned before in the first volume of this series, 
by anyone not educated to all kinds of shooting ; and 
the raw youth who has never pursued birds on his 
own account, nor handled a dog, nor trained himself 
to shoot carefully and accurately, but, on the other 
hand, has been allowed by too indulgent elders to 
take part in big days until he is nearly blase with 
heavy firing, is neither a desirable object nor a 
pleasant companion. I am glad to think, however, 
that these are the minority, and that the English lad 



i8o SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



is still keen enough, as a rule, to go out on his own 
account, and show his prowess in circumventing and 
securing birds without the aid of an array of beaters 
or drivers. 

Let me conduct such a one with me on to the 
moor, and, presuming that he already knows some- 
thing of the habits of the grouse, of the handling of 
his gun, and of the ways of his retriever, let me see, 
with all diffidence, if any hints that I can give will be 
of any service to him. 

Now mount your pony, and let us be off together. 
The other guns will follow soon, and we shall, at any 
rate, be first on the ground and into our places early. 
The drivers will start three miles from the first line 
of butts by time. It is, therefore, important that we 
should be on the spot punctually, or the birds will be 
coming over before we are there. Look to your girths 
before you get up, or your saddle may go round with 
you, and leave you in the middle of the road as we 
go down the hill. Through the little village we clat- 
ter, hustling the ducks and chickens out of the road- 
way, at that short and uncomfortable canter which 
appears specially to distinguish the hill pony. Round 
the bend at the end of the street, almost grazing our 
knees against the stone wall, as oui ponies hustle 
round the sharp turn, over the grey bridge that spans 



ENGLISH DRIVING 181 



with its single arch the narrow, but violent, torrent of 
the beck, brown and swollen from last night's rain ; 
and" once on the opposite side the ascent begins, the 
road widening out here and there into a green lane 
or common, where the geese hiss and cackle at us, 
barely floundering away from under our horses' feet. 
We begin to leave the region of the sycamore, the 
mountain ash, and the larch, while the foxglove and 
blackberry grow scarcer by the roadside. Now we 
emerge into a great inclosure of, say, a hundred acres, 
in which, though there are still patches of succulent 
green pasture, dotted with mushrooms or here and 
there spots of grey stone peeping through the sward, 
the coarser grasses and rushy tussocks of the moor 
begin to predominate. A whole herd of young cattle 
come dancing round us, and the temper of the old 
bull who watches us, sulky and motionless, as we 
ride by, is a source of inward anxiety, until we reach 
the gate in the high wall which is the boundary of the 
real moor. Now we are fairly in the open and on 
the heather, a flock of anxious peewits hovers close 
round our heads, screaming and turning over in the 
air : the wheatear evades us in a succession of short, 
jerky flights, curtseying at us in derision at each pause 
upon a stone, and so, making our way through moss 
hags, over stones, and carefully round boggy places, 



i82 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

but still always ascending, we reach the first of the 
line of butts. Now dismount and take your gun. 
You have drawn No. 4 butt, which is sure to b'e a 
good one ; and as we walk up to it from here, you 
may kill a grouse, which, as the drivers are still miles 
away, can do no harm. 

' Yak ! kak ! kak ! ' from close underneath No. 2 
butt. Well done, very good shot ! but look beyond 
there up the face at all those birds rising and going 
back into the drive. No matter, they will come on 
again. There is plenty of time, and you may gather 
from where those birds rose, about three hundred 
yards away, how difficult of approach the Yorkshire 
grouse is even in the early days of August. But here 
we are at our place, so let us get in and be ready for 
action. Now take the centre of the butt yourself, put 
half a dozen cartridges in your right-hand coat- pocket, 
that you may be able to put one quickly into the gun 
in case your loader should not be ready with your 
second when birds are coming thick. Let him place 
his bag of cartridges, well open, on the seat in the 
left-hand corner of the butt close to his hand, and I 
will crouch behind him rather to your right. Neither 
of us is likely to jump up, so that you can swing 
the gun round with freedom on both sides to shoot 
behind. Look with care to the height of the front of 



ENGLISH DRIVING 183 

the butt it should be just high enough to shoot over 
in comfort when you are standing upright make it 
up with the spare sods lying about, and especially on 
the left-hand side, as from that side you will show to 
the birds against the sky, and you must keep low as 
they come up hill. Now lean both of your guns 
against the front of the butt, being careful in so doing 
that no little pieces of peat fall down the muzzle. 
See that the barrels of both are clear, and that both 
are loaded, and now let us take a good survey of the 
exact position of our next-door neighbours, and of the 
ground in front of us. Ours is the first butt under 
the ridge to our right, No. 5 being on the point of 
the ridge, and No. 6 beyond it out of sight. The 
three butts on our left stretching down the hill, No. r 
being the bottom one, all look at first sight to be 
belter places than ours, but I think we shall find on 
examination of the favourable slack in front of us 
under the ridge that we shall get as much shooting 
as anybody. The sun is now quite hot. The grasses 
and heather buds on the ridge are waving and shiver- 
ing gently in the bree/.e against the bright sky. In 
I lie valley I can just hear the splash of the beck over 
tlie stones, and clearly as we can see every detail on 
the opposite slope, and the flat above it, and even that 
rocky ridge, crowned by the delicate blue of a far-off 



1 84 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



range, no sign of a driver's flag, with the exception of 
the two pointsmen not far off on our left, is visible. 

A hoarse exclamation, ' Lie down, will you ? ' from 
a loader to his dog, comes to us faintly on the breeze 
from the top butt ; a snatch of a skylark's song from 
the pastures, an occasional bark from a sheep dog in 
the valley, the single plaintive pipe of a young golden 
plover, seeming to come now from the flat in front, now 
from behind, and now from somewhere in the sky, are 
all the sounds that reach our ears. All is deliciously 
still, and the atmosphere, fragrant with heather buds 
and stimulating to the nerves, the brightness and 
purity of the light, with the enchanting prospect of 
heath and fell, of mountain and cloud, of the peaceful 
valley watered by a shining river, its humble interests 
all clustered round the grey church tower and bridge 
of the little market town two miles away and five 
hundred feet below you, would be worth the journey 
up here, even if grouse and shooting did not exist to 
make it, to your eyes, complete. Faintly a very distant 
rattle, the well-known music of the railway, catches 
your ear, and there, creeping gently down towards 
the town, is the little toy train, tracing its accurate 
line in picturesque contrast to the windings of the 
river, and giving with its long soft trail of snow-white 
steam a new note of interest to the slumbering land- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 185 



scape. Toy-like as it appears from here, that is a 
northern express going at fifty miles an hour, and it 
has even now passed out of sight. 

There ! On the rocky ridge afar off is a flash of 
something white; it is no, yes a driver's flag; there 
is another, showing black against the sunlit moor to the 
right yes, there they are, all or nearly all in sight, 
'and in the shape of a perfect horseshoe. 'The birds 
will not be here for some time yet,' you say. No, 
but I should take my gun and be on the watch for an 
odd lot often comes over very early off the flank of 
the drive. Look out, here are birds ! ' Black and 
mysterious looking, a little pack of some five-and- 
twenty suddenly show on the ridge about a hundred 
yards in front. Rapidly and silently they come along 
the riclge straight for your neighbour, No. 5. Whistle 
to him, it is only fair play but it is too late, for ///;//. 
Some hasty movement of his or his neighbour's 
beyond, and in an instant they have swerved and are 
coming right down on us. ' Take the first one,' One 
two well done ; that second one isn't down yet, 
but badly hit ; ah ! there he comes, stone dead I 
should say, just this side of that little knoll with the 
shining bit of white grass below it. I shall get him 
for you all right after the drive, when we hunt the 
ground behind. l>y this time you are very much on 

\ 



i86 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



the look-out, and so I now see are our neighbours, 
but there probably won't be any more for some little 
time. That little pack were all old birds, sitting on 
some bare place upon the ridge, and had got up 
thinking to sneak away long before the drivers came 
really near. And let me point out to you that, had 
your neighbour been 'watching out' as we were, the 
lot would never have swerved, but would have gone 
straight by him, an easy chance ; whereas as things 
are, he is either unconscious or furious, no matter 
which, and you are a brace of birds to the good, 
which he will only put down as an item of your extra- 
ordinary good luck. 

Now keep a sharp watch, and especially to your 
left. The birds that come over the ridge on the right 
must show well against the sky, and those in front 
will tell black against the sunlight of the opposite face; 
but those that come up the hill from the left, having 
crossed the gully without our seeing them, will be 
creeping very low over the heather, so that with the 
sun shining on their bodies they will be very difficult 
to see against the ground, and get right up to us un- 
awares, unless we are careful. Here they come, just 
from the point I warned you of, seven or eight of 
them, close to the top of the heather and very slow, 
for they have a little wind against them, have come a 



ENGLISH DRIVING 187 



long way, and are flying up hill. The slant of their 
course will bring them obliquely across you, heading 
straight for No. 5 and here is a good chance to get 
four with your two guns. Take the outside one on 
your right, they are sure to swing away a little when 
you fire, but those on your left will still cross near 
enough to deal with easily. Good ! he is stone dead, 
the second also, an easy cross shot straight in front, 
the third a miss, though an easy chance, and the 
fourth cleverly dropped by a longish shot just as they 
were swinging back all together. No. 5 kills one, close 
to your last, for they are now almost in front of him, 
and they are gone ; back over the ridge. 

That third shot was a pity, and arose from too 
much haste and flurry in changing your gun ; quite 
unnecessary, for there was really plenty of time, as 
there was another bird much nearer to you than the 
one you fired at with your fourth barrel. Bear this 
in mind another time. Here come two straight to 
you from under the ridge ; take care, for these are 
coming thrice as fast as the last, the side wind helping 
them a little, and rather higher. Slightly to your right 
the}' come over at express pace ; ah ! your first barrel 
was neither high enough nor forward enough, as you 
see by those little floating white feathers from under 
his tail, but swinging quickly you killed him well 



1 88 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

with your second behind the line, and he has fallen 
stone dead in that patch of rushes by the little 
trickle of water. ' You ought to have had them 
both.' Yes, you ought, but the first barrel at a fast 
grouse at about twenty feet from the ground always 
demands just sufficient forethought to remember to 
lift the left arm well up and to shoot well over him. 

Now they are coming more frequently, and mostly 
very straight to us from the ridge to our right, and 
from the front. Look out again from the left you 
see those had got to within ten yards of you, coming 
from below before you saw them, and that is why, 
instead of getting at least three, if not four of them, 
all ea.sy shots, you in your hurry missed your first, 
killed your second behind, and fired two most ridiculous 
shots at him with your second gun after they were too 
far off. Your eyes should run over all the ground in 
front of you, from the extreme right to left and back 
again, incessantly. Especially you should watch two 
points that where the ridge sinks into the skyline 
eighty yards ahead, and that on the left where they 
come creeping to you from below. You ought by 
now to be getting to know the instant a bird is 
in sight whether he is really coming to you or not. 
Observe how those that you first see in front of 
you nearly all swing with the wind down to No. 3 on 



ENGLISH DRIVING 189 

your left ; and on the other hand how the same curve 
in their flight causes all those which first show at the 
point of the ridge I just mentioned to come right 
on to you, though first seen straight in front of No. 5. 

Look out for those two in front, they are going to 
settle, and you should always shoot at a settling bird, 
even up to a longish range. You missed the moment, 
and probably the bird also. Just when he tucks his 
tail in, and is sinking down into the heather, with his 
wings open and neck and breast exposed, he is very 
vulnerable, and may be killed at a long way off. 
There, he has run on to that stone now take him 
sitting, it is better to put him up in any case, for he 
will only attract others to settle near him. Ah, you 
shot over him, and he is off. There is only one way 
to make sure of a sitting bird, a trick I found out for 
myself at pigeon shooting : aim carefully three or four 
feet under him, raise the muzzle gently till it just 
covers his toes, at that moment pull, and you will 
never miss another sitter. 

Now there is a fine lot -they seem to be streaming 
at you from all points in front, there must be two or 
three hundred of them. Keep cool, take the one 
coming straight for the right-hand corner of our butt 
and who leads the pack, first. Well killed ! the second 
snapped rather too hastily in front, the third well 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



killed ; but why, oh ! why did you turn round ? the 
fourth one you shot at and missed was ridiculously 
far, and then one nearly knocked your cap off mean- 
while. Again you change guns, and kill one out of 
two hastily shot at behind the butts, and as you again 
get your seventh and eighth barrels to work you find 
that birds have been streaming straight to you all the 
while, tailing off after the main body of the pack. 
Result five birds with your eight barrels, while, shoot- 
ing as well as you do, you ought to have very easily 
killed with all the shots and secured eight birds. As 
long as there are birds still coming on you should never 
turn round at all, but keep on plugging away always 
at those which catch your eye as coming easiest, and 
letting them get tolerably near you before firing. As 
in watching a first-rate professional at billiards you 
will be astonished at the number of easy strokes he 
gets, and notice how seldom he takes a difficult one, 
so a high-class performer with the gun will achieve as 
much by his rapid selection of easy chances as by 
accuracy of shooting. There will always be plenty of 
difficult shots during a drive on which to employ his 
more brilliant efforts, and which he will kill with all 
the more certainty from ' getting his eye in ' at the 
easy ones. But this is a part of the art that is not 
learned in a day, even by the most brilliant natural shot. 



ENGLISH DRIVING 191 



Now here come three, one a little ahead of the 
other two and straight to you, the others abreast and 
a trifle to your left. Take the leader first, shooting 
rather soon, at what looks like forty yards, and with 
particular accuracy ; change guns quickly without 
firing the second barrel, and kill the other two with 
your second gun, one by sharp work just in front and 
the other an easy one behind. Good, you have got 
all three ; and no doubt you see the advantage of 
this manoeuvre. Had you stuck to your first gun 
after killing the first, you would have had to pause a 
little to get the next with your second barrel, and while 
you were changing guns the third bird would have got 
so far that you would almost certainly have lost him. 

Now the holloaing of the drivers sounds quite near, 
and in fact, though you cannot yet see them, for they 
are still climbing out of the gully and under the fall 
of the ground in front of you, they are probably 
not more than 150 yards off, a distance at which you 
may easily blind a man. You must now only shoot at 
birds a moderate height up in the air, or low to your 
right against the ridge, or behind. What remain are 
coming singly and easier, but look out for a small 
burst off the ridge, for remember we saw a good many 
settle there from time to time. There they come, 
but they won't quite face it, and hang back, giving 



192 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

long, high, crossing shots, and going clean back 
over the drivers. High, and well forward, and you 
have killed a beautiful double shot ; don't forget to 
pick these up afterwards, for they have fallen a long 
way from any of your other birds. 

The drivers are showing all along the line, their 
flags are rattling in the wind, and it is nearly over. 
Do you remember where that bird settled about sixty 
yards in front, just in that deep bit of heather ? They 
will go past him, for I don't think he has ever risen ; 
call to them, waving them to where he was. Yak-kak ! 
there he is, and as he comes straight on and rather 
high you have killed him easily and safely over their 
heads. He is about the last, and I think as the 
drivers are now only forty yards off, we may go out 
and pick up. 

It is better now to make the loader hold your dog 
until we have picked up all the dead ones near the butt 
on the burnt ground. It is bad for him to see so many 
dead on the ground and he will have had enough work 
by the end of the day. Having done this the man can 
go off after the bird we marked at the very beginning 
of the drive, which is quite dead, and you and I will 
look after the otheis with the dog, particularly those 
two or three which fell, not killed dead, near the little 
burnside. Twenty- seven you had down, besides one 



ENGLISH DRIVING 193 



of these not counted, which will probably rise again. 
Well, we must pick them all up. Now we have 
gathered twenty-one, and your loader has the far-off bird 
which makes twenty-two. Wait a moment till he re- 
joins us and is out of the way, and we will try for the 
three in the burn. Now be ready with your gun, and 
mind to work your dog up to them from this side, for 
right and left and behind us are men all over the 
place picking up, and unless we drive him away in the 
forward direction you will not be able to shoot safely. 
Ah, I see the dog winds him ; look out, there he is, 
and safely killed without trouble. One of the others 
proves to be winged, and to have run a long way down 
the burn till he is gathered right behind No. 3, but 
though the latter looks rather askance at us for being 
off our own ground, the bird was fairly footed by the 
dog all the way from where he fell. The third is 
lying stone dead in a little pool, so now we have 
twenty-five ; but stay, we had almost forgotten the 
two you killed right away in front, as they were turn- 
ing back. Now we have got both of them, though 
the second took the dog a hundred yards down the 
gully, leaving a long track of feathers like the ' scent ' 
of a paper chase on the tops of the heather. But 
where have we left the twenty-eighth ? ' We must 
have been mistaken,' you say, 'for we have hunted the 

o 



194 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

ground all over.' ' I beg your pardon, I am quite 
sure of my count ; so just look with me carefully close 
round the butt, where a bird often gets left. Here he 
Jies, down a deep rift in the peat, in a little stagnant 
pool of brown water, which is why he had no scent, 
almost hidden by overhanging heather, not five yards 
from the butt ; so there is our correct number. You 
can see from this the value of accurate counting, for 
without me you would certainly have gone away 
satisfied you had picked all up, and left that last 
bird to rot.' 

As we have not been called on yet by our host, we 
might just look at where the second of those two 
settled in front, for the one which ran on to the stone 
and got away was not the bird you fired at settling. 
I thought not, and there to our joy is the other one, 
not quite dead, crouching deep under the thick 
heather, and found very prettily by the dog. That 
was lucky, I thought you had missed him, for he 
seemed to drop all right into the heather. 

So we have made it up to twenty-nine, a fair good 
drive, and though your shooting was really very good, 
you must remember that on several occasions you 
missed the chance of easily getting more, merely by 
undue hurry, or not making the most of the position. 

Now we shift across, and rather uphill, about two 



ENGLISH DRIVING 195 



hundred yards only for the return drive. For some 
years \ve used to drive back over the same butts ; but 
grouse hardly ever return to any ground by the same 
line as they took to leave it, and here they always 
come back higher up, with the exception of a few 
lots which will return much lower down, and which 
it cannot be hoped to include in the drive. 

The reason of this is the wind the invariable 
factor in determining the line of the flight of grouse. 
This time they will be coming back off higher ground, 
the wind, though still across, being rather more behind 
them, an important fact to them, and with the sun 
also more behind them, an equally important one to 
you. You have now to keep, if possible, more care- 
fully on the watch than before, and from the first 
moment after getting to your place, for some will 
return to their own ground almost immediately. Here 
you must carefully scan the face of the hill opposite 
you, bothered as you are by the sun, now on your 
left ; for they will be very difficult to see against the 
dark rising ground, and come very fast. You will 
get no shots against the sky except at such as come 
high. 

They return on higher ground here for two reasons, 
one being that the majority of those in the last drive 
actually came off higher ground over the ridge to 

u 2 



ig6 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

your right than you supposed, which was swept in 
sideways by the flank, and to which they wish to re- 
turn ; and the other that the wind, the more imme- 
diate reason, being here on their quarter, they can the 
more easily slant across it, and are not obliged to 
curve round under the ridge, as they would do if it 
were at all against them. Remember that here they 
will all come very fast, and though nothing would 
really turn them, they will swerve and twist a good 
deal if you make hasty or jerky movements just as 
they approach you. This is another fruitful reason 
of the wonderful ' luck ' usually ascribed to a first- 
rate man. The duffer next to him exposes himself, 
bobs or shifts about, and turns many a bird from 
himself right towards the motionless form of his more 
accomplished neighbour, such birds 'counting two 
on a division ' as politicians would say. Here again, 
if they are coming straight, as most of them will, 
there can be no question of killing three or four, 
except out of a big or streaming lot. Make sure of 
your double shot, one in front and one behind, letting 
the first one come pretty close to you before firing, 
and swinging round like lightning for the second. To 
this end make sure that your footing is secure, and 
your loader so placed as not to interfere with your 
movements, for when birds are coming very fast down 



ENGLISH DRIVING 197 

wind you have to turn round with extreme quickness, 
and must be free in your movements, with your feet on 
level ground. When you come to the pick-up, bear 
in mind that your dead birds will all be much farther 
back than you would suppose, and that you will have 
none, except cross shots, in front of your butt. Take 
your dog right away back at once to a point a little 
farther off than your farthest bird, and then hunt him 
up carefully towards the butt, so as to give him the 
full benefit of the wind. 

In conclusion, never wait to kill a bird behind the 
line while it is possible to kill him in front ; but be 
careful not to dwell upon or follow birds coming into 
the line, this being the most fruitful cause of accident. 

Thus may one endeavour to instruct those who 
are beginning to practise this most engaging of all 
forms of shooting. There are a few further points 
I would urge, on some of which I must disagree with 
what has been written elsewhere, though I am against 
splitting straws with persons who have undoubtedly 
brought much study to bear upon the subject. I can- 
not agree with one well-known authority, who advises 
men never to shoot at birds which settle in front. I 
would always recommend shooting at them even up 
to seventy or eighty yards off. First, as remarked 
above, they can be killed up to a good distance : 



198 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

secondly, because they will always attract others to 
settle near them. Whether the fresh arrivals detect 
the presence of those already there by sight or smell 
I cannot say, but it is certain that if birds have settled 
in front of you, and you do not disturb them, a great 
proportion of those following on after them will drop 
down to them. I have often seen them rise and 
come straight on over the guns after being shot at 
when in the act of alighting or sitting, showing that 
they did not detect where the sound proceeded from. 
Late in the drive, when the men are getting com- 
paratively close,-it is better to leave them alone, on 
the chance of their coming forward : early in the drive 
always shoot; if they go back, they will probably 
alight again before reaching the drivers, and be forced 
forward a second time. 

When you are shooting grouse with one gun only, 
and a big lot of birds are coming to you, fire your two 
barrels early, duck down below the butt, and as long 
as there are still grouse within shot, put in one cart- 
ridge only. You will do more execution this way 
than by waiting to load both barrels. I once killed 
five birds out of one lot of about fifty in this manner, 
and I ought to have killed six, for I missed the third 
shot, about the easiest of all. I need hardly say they 
were coming slowly against the wind, and swerved a 



ENGLISH DRIVING 199 



little across me after the first shot, or it could not have 
been done. Keep your cartridges in your right-hand 
pocket, and have your bag on the seat, wide open, on 
your right, unless it is raining, when you must see 
them bestowed in the dry, but the strap of the bag 
left unbuckled ; and always feed your gun direct from 
your right-hand pocket. I must say that since giving 
them a fair trial I am distinctly in favour of brass- 
covered cartridges, and more especially for grouse 
driving, when one is so often overtaken by heavy 
showers, during which the necessity for quick firing 
makes it impossible to keep them all dry. For those 
who use ejectors, they will be found, in the long run, 
an economy, in spite of their trifling additional cost. 
The ejectors of my present guns (Purdey's) have never 
been out of order but once, and that was when I got 
a sodden paper cartridge stuck fast, and used too 
much force to extract it. We usually have to pay a 
penalty for every improvement in this world, and the 
use of hammerless guns with ejectors is no exception 
to the rule. The mechanism of the piece is more 
complicated, and requires more care in cleaning and 
general treatment ; but with these precautions and 
brass-covered cartridges there is no reason whatever 
why guns of this improved type, turned out by a good 
maker, should get out of order. They should not be 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



cleaned with anything but vaseline, which never cor- 
rodes, and only a moderate quantity of that ; the 
great secret being to keep all accessible parts of the 
action as clean and dry as possible. A heavy-handed, 
ignorant under-keeper, whether English or Scotch, is 
rarely fit to be trusted with the handling or cleaning 
of such valuable articles as the best breech-loaders of 
to-day. 

Whatever may be said to the contrary, the general 
verdict of those who have the best opportunities of 
judging is in favour of the best guns by the best 
makers. You will often hear it said that these 
makers' charges for their best quality of guns are 
' outrageous,' and all sorts of ugly words applied to 
those whose position in the trade enables them to set 
the market price of these articles. I must put in a 
plea for the good gunmaker. It would be invidious 
to particularise, but there are several makers in Lon- 
don whose names are in everybody's mouth, and who 
turn out guns, undoubtedly high-priced, but which, 
to my thinking, are well worth the money. Everyone 
who knows anything at all of the subject, knows that 
the profit on the best quality of gun is not heavy, 
much smaller, in fact, than on cheaper articles 
of all sorts supplied by the trade generally, while 
most of the most valuable part of the work is not 



ENGLISH DRIVING 201 

visible, and would not be detected by the inex- 
perienced. A great deal of personal care, as well as 
honest and dearly paid labour, is expended on a pair 
of ' best guns ' by one of these firms ; and I fail to 
see why a man should grumble at giving, say, 1407. 
or i5o/., or even more, for articles which, properly 
cared for, will last him his lifetime, and for which the 
demand is constantly and widely increasing. A well- 
built gun, besides its practical use, is, to a certain 
extent, a work of art, and it should be borne in 
mind that as an article of British manufacture it still 
holds its place against the competition of all other 
countries ; and that whether you care to give the 
price or not, there are plenty of Frenchmen Italians, 
Austrians and Americans, without reckoning our own 
colonists, who are ready enough to do so. The class 
of gunmaker I am alluding to is one who makes 
your piece to order, and specially to fit your 
individual characteristics, who pays very high for 
skilled labour, and bestows personal judgment and 
care, the outcome of actual knowledge of working 
at the bench, upon every detail of your order. There 
is another class, who advertise weapons of extra- 
ordinary cheapness, but are merely agents for great 
manufacturing firms, who have a large stock of guns 
always on hand, and stand in the same relation to 



202 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



those mentioned above as the reach-me-down clothes 
shop to the high-class West End tailor. These 
I cannot recommend. I must not conclude this 
necessary digression on choice of guns without adding 
that he who lives in the country entirely, and cannot 
afford the price of the first-rate London firm, will do 
better to employ a provincial maker of known re- 
pute. Of these there are several in England and 
Scotland of whom very excellent judges have reason 
to speak in terms of high praise, and whose work is 
far better than that of the wholesale heavily puffed 
firms, trading under assumed London names, who 
falsely profess to give you the same article as the good 
itiakers at one-third of the price. 

A few words on this subject have not appeared to 
me out of place in a chapter on grouse driving, since 
it is precisely in this branch of sport that guns are 
put to the most severe tests. The atmospheric con- 
ditions, exposing the workmanship of your piece to 
great extremes of heat, wet and cold, with the con- 
comitant condition of very heavy firing, rapid working 
of the mechanism, and maximum of expansion or con- 
traction of the metal, try the workmanship of a gun 
severely. A weapon which 'jams' in the middle of a 
good grouse drive would spoil the temper of an arch- 
angel. In the arrangement and conduct of your drives 



ENGLISH DRIVING 203 

I must repeat, with even greater emphasis, what I have 
said in the volume on the ' Partridge ' concerning 
wind ; but you are far more in the hands of your head 
man and his drivers on this point than in any partridge 
drive. The latter have often to foot it some miles, 
even before you are out of your bed, to get to the 
remote point whence they will start the first drive. 
This involves organisation, since, living possibly some 
distance apart, they will not all start from the same 
place, and probably consist of two parties, each of 
which must be under a responsible lieutenant who 
thoroughly knows the ground. Consequently, should 
it be advisable to change the beat for the day on 
account of wind, or even the method of beating the 
ground, you must be able to rely absolutely upon the 
judgment and decision of your head man. 

It is almost indispensable that he should be a moor- 
land man, born and bred, though I admit that I have 
come across one or two notable exceptions to this. If 
he doesn't know the moors, literally up hill and down 
dale, every turn of the wind, every habit of the grouse, 
and every dodge of the driver, he is of no use to you 
in Yorkshire. He will command neither the confi- 
dence nor the obedience of his drivers, who, being 
nil dalesmen who have travelled tin; moors and fells 
all their lives, know a good deal on their own account, 



204 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



and have it largely in their power to frustrate the most 
elaborate manoeuvres. If you have to select a new 
chief, it is far better to promote the most trustworthy 
of the men who have been driving on the moor for 
years, rather than to put a man over their heads who 
has been mostly used to low-ground shooting, merely 
because he is considered ' fit for a head keeper's 
place.' 

Very difficult manoeuvres have sometimes to be 
executed, and unless your moor is very large in extent 
it is only by the most delicate and experienced hand- 
ling, in which every man must honestly co-operate, 
that the birds can be kept upon your ground. Five 
thousand acres is not nearly enough to hold large 
packs in a high wind, unless they are very well ma- 
naged. Suppose, for instance, that a large number of 
birds are packed at the head of a valley and on the 
ridge, close to the march, and there is a strong wind 
blowing towards the march. Unless your men get 
round very gingerly, keeping out of sight as carefully 
as a stalker getting up to deer, on the down-wind side, 
the game is up, and possibly your whole day's spcrt 
spoilt. 

I have seen this very manoeuvre beautifully carried 
out, and even the birds, having somehow taken the 
alarm, rise and make a big circuit round near the march 



ENGLISH DRIVING 205 



before the two flanks of the drive had met; the whole of 
the men on the windward side lay flat down the instant 
the birds rose, and that without a word of command. 
The pack settled down again, and the down-wind side 
got well round and brought them on over our heads. 
What would an obstinate Scotchman with recalcitrant 
drivers say to that ! 

If, again, the head man is one in whom his drivers 
have complete confidence, and who has trained his lieu- 
tenants to carry out his orders whether he is present or 
not, he can enjoy the inestimable advantage of placing 
himself on the flank close to the guns, or of going 
into one of the butts with his master or some other 
shooter, and observing the exact result of his plan of 
campaign, and what alterations, if any, should be 
made in the line of butts. It is also an excellent 
thing, should opportunity serve, to let him visit other 
moors where good driving is carried on, and where he 
may pick up a new wrinkle or two, or get rid of ideas 
which may be too local. 

I urge these points because it is impossible to in- 
oculate a man with the instinct which alone makes a 
first-rate grouse driver. The theory of the dis- 
position of your drivers, the horse-shoe formation, the 
placing of the flankers, and the method of progres- 
sion, is now thoroughly familiar to all immediately 



206 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

concerned in English driving. I have gone into it in 
greater detail in the chapter on Scotch Driving, in 
order, if possible, to be of use to those who wish to 
introduce it on Scotch moors, or to persuade such as 
oppose the system from ignorant, conservative, or in- 
terested motives, of its practical value to their ground. 

In the construction and placing of the butts a few 
points should be noted. The larger and more com- 
modious they are the better, seven feet square on 
the inside being about the most convenient size ; 
and there should be a seat of heather sods or flat 
stones in each corner. Some spare sods should 
always be cut and left close outside them, that there 
may be something for a tall man to build up his 
front wall with, should it be too low. The floor must 
be absolutely level and well drained. At Mr. Riming- 
ton Wilson's at Broomhead, on the Sheffield range, 
the butts have board floors, a great comfort to the 
shooters in many ways ; but on many moors the cart- 
ing of timber up to the butts would be impracticable ; 
and on this particular moor on the principal days the 
driving is all done to two lines of butts close together, 
one on each side of a little gully, which has probably 
witnessed the slaying of more grouse than any spot 
of its size in the British Islands. 

A point of extreme importance, for the safety of 



ENGLISH DRIVING 



207 



the shooters, is that all the butts should be ' dressed ' 
square with the line ; that is, that the front should be 
at right angles to the direction of the drive. I have 
often, when in a butt set askew, found myself bothered 
in the hurry of quick firing to remember the exact 
line, and on reflection am convinced that many of the 
accidents that have occurred in grouse driving have 




been due to this cause. The diagram will perhaps 
explain what I mean. 

The butts A, n, c, together with the rest of the 
row not shown, are all on the line EK at right angles 
to the general direction of the drive. Now the man 
in the butt 11, though lie will doubtless survey the 
position of his neighbours before the drive begins, will 



208 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

probably, after his attention has become riveted on a 
succession of approaching birds, begin instinctively to 
face the front wall of his butt. Being so used to 
finding his neighbours placed at right angles to the 
side walls of his butt, and on the same line as the 
front, that danger in this quarter has become a matter 
of instinct rather than observation, his brain will 
imagine them to be located on the line DD. This 
delusion may only last a moment or two while he is 
watching birds ; but it may lead him to shoot at a 
bird at the point F, and so seriously damage the 
man in the butt c, or on the other side to take a 
shot at the point G, imagining the bird to have passed 
the line, and so to injure the man in the butt A. 

I have no evidence to prove that accidents have 
occurred from this cause, but they have occurred at 
drives where I have seen butts placed in this manner, 
and I have myself been so near shooting my neighbour 
under these circumstances that it cannot be wrong to 
point out the possible danger. 

Let there be always plenty of butts on the moor, 
that you may be able to drive according to the wind. 
If in any drive you notice that two or three of the 
guns invariably get all the shooting, it is better to 
put two or possibly three in a second line behind 
them, being careful they are full}- 200 yards off, any 



ENGLISH DRIVING 209 



less distance not being safe for the eyes of your 
friends. 

In the early part of the season it is better not to 
have too many drivers ; the birds which they pass by 
without flushing will be all young ones, precisely those 
required for breeding stock, and if they came on, as 
they would, at the end of the drive, singly and flying 
very slowly, they would all be massacred. If your 
moor is at the end of a spur of the greater range, you 
can always insure a good double drive by pushing 
them first to the end, next the cultivated land, and 
then bringing them back ; but in such a case your 
men had better sweep in some of the pastures below 
the end of the moor, on which there arc sure to be 
birds. This formation of ground accounts partially 
for the certainty with which a large bag can be made 
on many moors, notably on Broomhead and Blubber- 
house. 1 In severe or bad breeding seasons the lower 
moors will suffer less than the higher, and as the 
former will be always fed, to a certain extent, by the 
latter, and have the advantage of them, it behoves 
the owner of moorland which is lower than his 
neighbours, and constitutes the end of a large ridge 
or stretch, not to be too hard upon the birds, especially 
late on in the season. Were he able to kill every 

1 Mr. Kimington Wilson's and Lord Wnlsingham's respectively. 

P 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



bird upon his land, it would undoubtedly be re-stocked 
from the higher ground, and in the winter months, 
when mild weather prevails higher up, he is sure to 
have many more than his share upon his ground. 

The counting and picking up of the dead birds is 
a subject for serious consideration. I well remember, 
twenty years ago in Yorkshire, amongst a few of us 
who met constantly and whose comparative form 
would have been difficult to handicap, every day's 
grouse driving might as well have been a valuable 
sweepstake or a series of matches for ioo/. a side, 
so keen was the rivalry, the scoring, and the picking 
up. But I cannot say that it was a desirable state of 
things. The counting of what you have killed is no 
doubt necessary, but it might be done on the same 
principle as I have recommended for partridge driving, 
that is, keeping a score of the claims without putting 
them against any names. That which promotes keen- 
ness is good ; that which provokes jealousy is surely 
bad. The lines of pegs halfway between each butt, 
recommended by Sir R. Payne-Gallwey, were first 
adopted, I believe, upon a suggestion of mine at 
Broomhead some years ago, and Mr. Wilson has seen 
no reason to remove them since. To insure bagging 
all that have been knocked down, as well as in the 
interests of humanity, there should always be a pro- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 211 

fcssional ' picker up ' in the person of a keeper with 
a brace or more of retrieving spaniels, who should 
hunt round the ine of butts after the guns have 
gathered all they can. An old pointer or setter is 
not bad for this work, but spaniels that will hunt close, 
if they are not too hard-mouthed, are better. Should 
you be a breeder of retrievers, here is a good oppor- 
tunity for your dog man to do a little breaking in ; 
and if they are well under control, there is no doubt 
they are the best of all. 

I well remember the first appearance of old John 
Young, Lord Londesborough's head man for over a 
quarter of a century, upon a West Riding moor in 
187 r. He was supposed never to have seen a grouse, 
though a veteran in years and in experience of field 
and covert. He brought with him three of the most 
useful-looking brown retrievers to pick up his master's 
birds. Clad as he was in a heavy green velveteen 
coat with brass buttons, a red waistcoat, thick cord 
breeches, and gaiters, and an enormous gold-laced 
hat, he appeared to radiate heat and light on all 
around, and was a sufficiently striking object on the 
heather on a sweltering September day. He had 
about eight grouse in each hand, and his dogs were 
still diligently hunting, when we came across him, far 
away from his master's butt. We chaffed him on the 



212 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



fact that, though he was a novice to grouse, he seemed 
to be a pretty good hand at picking up. Laying down 
his birds, and raising the gold-laced beaver with an 
air peculiar to him, ' Never was on a moor before in 
my life, I can assure you, gentlemen,' he said, with 
perfect courtesy. Nevertheless, he had gathered about 
fifteen more birds than his master, always a most 
generous neighbour, had claimed ; and though he 
must have narrowly escaped an apoplectic fit, he and 
his dogs continued to work equally hard all day. 

In laying out your lines of butts, bear in mind 
that there is no invariable necessity for your driving 
line to progress from a given base in a direct line to 
the centre of the butts. It frequently occurs that on 
a particular range of moor the birds will always fly in 
a great curve, or a complete ring, eventually getting 
back in this manner to the ground they were flushed 
upon. In this case you must also drive on a curve, 
and the first half of the beat may have to be driven 
by advancing almost at right angles to the direction 
desired, or, so to speak, across the face of the row of 
butts. As in this diagram, for instance, you may wish 
to drive your birds, mostly lying about A, to some- 
where about the point D. 

But for reasons connected with the nature of the 
ground, they will not fly from A to D direct, but in- 



ENGLISH DRIVING 



213 



variably fly from A in the curves indicated, alighting 
mostly at the points x x. Now, make your formation 
as shown here, follow their curve to the point x with 




Fir,. 7. 



214 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

the main body of your men, and on flushing them 
again at the points x x you will find they fly on to 
one or other of the points about D, where I have in- 
dicated lines of butts. 

To arrive at these things you must either be on 
the moor as constantly as a keeper or a shepherd, or 
have out a few men and make experimental drives, 
letting your head man lie on a high point, whence he 
can command a view of the whole manoeuvre. 

The endless varieties and possibilities of managing 
grouse according to conditions of ground, wind, and 
season, will afford you many interesting and pleasant 
days between the intervals of your shooting parties, 
while they will add immensely to your enjoyment of 
the results. 

For actual marksmanship I must refer my readers 
to what I have endeavoured to make clear in the 
volume on ' Partridge ' of this series, and to the dia- 
grams explaining the reasons for shooting over birds, 
&c., repeating once more that it is impossible to teach 
anyone how to shoot driven birds. With driven grouse 
the necessity for shooting high is even more marked 
than with partridges. You will get many more shots 
on the level and below you, and in aiming at these you 
must constantly bear in mind to avoid the tendency 
to dwell or poke at the birds. This ahvays results 



ENGLISH DRIVING 215 



more or less in your dropping the muzzle of the gun 
and shooting underneath. You will often see very 
bad practice made at grouse flying very low, creeping 
as it were over the heather, and perhaps going slowly 
against the wind. Here all the missing takes place 
from shooting under them. The only way to avoid it 
is to form the habit of firing the instant the gun is firm 
on the shoulder, and of striking your aim high, almost 
as though you would shoot just over the bird's back. 

Many people think they miss these birds from 
shooting in front of them. I fancy this is rarely 
the case, but at any rate the matter can be easily 
tested by firing one or two shots straight at them, and 
watching the result. You will find that you kill low- 
flying birds more easily when they are above you than 
below, a fact which sufficiently proves that in aiming 
at the latter it is the depression of the muzzle which 
accounts for the missing. Keep the left arm well 
forward, and lift it well, relying upon this member 
entirely for the swing and support of your piece. 
You have less to guide your eye in the way of station- 
ary objects, such as trees, &c., in grouse driving, and 
therefore you must make up your mind to rely more 
than ever on calculation as to where to aim. The 
principle, which I have before advocated, of rapidly 
deciding in your mind where the spot is in the air at 



216 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

which your shot will intercept the bird's flight, and 
throwing your gun directly and quickly upon it, is 
the only one by which you can compete with the 
endless variety of angle, curve, elevation and pace, 
which lends to the flight of driven grouse its un- 
doubted fascination. There can be no 'knack' in 
excelling at a sport which presents this feature in the 
highest degree of all. The individual driven grouse 
which comes straight at your nose on a still day is 
easy enough, but these are the ' half-volleys ' of grouse 
driving, and to hit them does not necessarily make 
you a good bat. It is a very different matter to realise 
the proper total from a succession of fine drives under 
varying conditions of light, locality and wind ; and 
when the day comes that you have achieved this, in 
first-rate form from start to finish, you will sleep like 
a public-school boy who has made 100 at Lord's, or 
a Prime Minister who has carried a great measure 
through the Commons by a triumphant majority, per- 
haps the two most enviable achievements known in 
this country. 



217 



CHAPTER V 

GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 

IT is beginning to be generally understood that a 
moor, whether English or Scotch, will not produce the 
stock of grouse demanded by modern ideas, or to 
satisfy appetites whetted by the experience of excep- 
tional seasons and results, without due attention to the 
management of the ground, and to the nourishment of 
a healthy stock of birds. The old system of treat- 
ing grouse entirely as fenc naturce, and trusting 
them and the ground on which they breed to 
the development of nature, may leave you always a 
sprinkling of birds, but will not give you the stock you 
have a right to expect after paying the high value 
which such shooting now commands, nor satisfy the 
requirements of your friends. Further, it is found 
that however large the supply, the demand for these, 
the best of all game birds for the table, increases pro- 
portionately, and that it is possible to throw away 
a great deal of good money and food supply by 



2i8 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

allowing incompetence or want of care to decrease the 
productive powers of good moorland. 

Again, as this demand increases and the subject is 
more and more widely ventilated, the ingenuity of the 
poacher, the pothunter, and the receiver of poached or 
illegally killed game becomes annually more formid- 
able. The only saving clause is that the red grouse 
being universally known to be exclusively indigenous 
to the British Islands, we do not see the poulterer's 
shops in March, April, or May full of ' Siberian ' or 
' Norwegian ' grouse stolen from British moors, as we 
undoubtedly should if the species were found in those 
foreign countries. I must refer my readers to my 
remarks in the volume on ' The Partridge ' as to the 
illegally procured birds which come into the London 
markets on August 12 and September i, and to 
the suggestions I there made, which I now wish to 
urge again. Owners and lessees of shootings seem 
for the most part not to have realised the extent of 
the illicit traffic in game, which applies to grouse 
almost more than any other kind ; and I venture again 
to express the hope that some one with more leisure 
and more influence than I have may found some Asso- 
ciation to combat this evil in a businesslike manner. 
Those who are in London on August 1 2 may be quite 
certain that any grouse that is offered to them, 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 219 



unless sent direct by a friend from his own moor, is 
a poached, practically a stolen, bird. I remember 
being served with one which was absolutely putrid on 
the Twelfth, some years ago, at a well-known London 
restaurant. An old friend, the late Lord Dupplin, 
was dining near me, and had an equally bad one 
served to him. We agreed to send them both away 
in fact, though the price was 14^. per bird, they 
were uneatable but the head waiter explained (?) 
to us that this was the true flavour of the grouse, and 
that we were ignorant. Poor Duppy ! I can see his 
face of mingled disgust and amusement now at the 
idea of a crapulous Swiss waiter explaining to him and 
me what a grouse ought to taste like. 

But since the price that can be obtained for these 
birds on the Twelfth will always be a temptation to 
the evilly disposed, it behoves owners to look closely 
after what happens in the moorland districts in the 
week preceding that day. They cannot always be on 
the spot at that time, but if an association or league, 
such as I suggested in the former volume, were 
formed, trained detectives could easily watch the 
consignments passing through certain centres from 
the moorland, and trace their origin and destination. 
It has even come to this, that, as I am informed, silk 
and other nets are actually provided by London 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



poulterers, and are supplied to their fellow-culprits 
in this traffic, if not to the poachers direct ; and no 
questions are asked as long as they get the supply of 
grouse for sale on the Twelfth. This is a disgraceful 
state of things ; and it should be remembered that, 
without troubling Parliament with further legislation 
(which, unhappily, in these days is beset with diffi- 
culties of all kinds), there is ample law to put a stop 
to these practices if only trouble is taken to run the 
offenders to ground. 

It would be impossible to prevent the sale itself 
of grouse at a distance from the moors, say in London 
or elsewhere, but at least those who are fond of sport 
may do something to check the demand. I would, 
therefore, beg all good sportsmen who may be far 
from the moors on the Twelfth to restrain their appe- 
tite for grouse, and refuse to purchase any for a day 
or two at least. If this were universally done in 
restaurants and clubs, it would go far towards check- 
ing the evil, and those to whom I appeal would be 
spared the indignation or gastronomic disappoint- 
ment which they will probably experience on being 
offered a grouse of a week old which purports to have 
been killed that morning. 

Grouse are poached in many ways, and one of the 
most destructive is the recently introduced practice 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 221 

of surrounding a moor with nets, which catch the 
birds as they fly off it on to the neighbouring pas- 
tures. This has been carried to such a pitch in some 
parts of Yorkshire, Westmoreland, and the other 
northern counties, that the value of a moor becomes 
seriously affected by it. A sort of blackmail is set 
up, which obliges anyone taking the moor either to 
hire all the adjoining pasture land as well, or to enter 
into an agreement with certain parties not to net in 
this manner for either of which forms of protection 
he is mulcted in proportion to the value of the net- 
ting on such ground, often amounting to nearly as 
large a number of birds as he will get on the moor 
proper by fair shooting. On one Yorkshire moor 
that I know this lately became so serious, and the 
stock was getting so much reduced, that the owner 
purchased netting himself, which he set on the moor 
edges in charge of his own men, so as to intercept 
the birds before they reached the enemy's nets, those 
taken being merely set at liberty again. Miles of 
this netting these poachers have in some places, so 
that the protecting nets of the owner and the con- 
stant watching become a serious consideration. 

It is difficult to see how this can be prevented by 
the operation of law, since where it is done on any 
scale the net owners are careful to take out a game 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



licence, and to keep strictly to their own ground. 
But a great deal of netting is done illegally on other 
people's ground, both by night and day pure poach- 
ing, in fact and has become a very common and 
lucrative business. This is due almost entirely to the 
supineness or ignorance of the owners of moors, who 
for the most part are not in the locality at the time 
when it is done, and who seem to me much too ready 
to accept the invariable excuse of ' disease ' or ' cold 
breeding season ' for the low stock of birds on the 
ground. 

As with partridges and other game, I have always 
observed that where there are really first-rate and 
honest keepers, there is always a pretty good stock of 
grouse. Of course seasons will vary, and anyone 
used to the moors will know pretty well when to make 
the allowance for bad weather, &c.; but it is astonish- 
ing how lightly moors suffer from this cause or from 
disease when the keeper > and his subordinates are 
thoroughly trustworthy. The only remedy you have as 
an owner is to pay strictly by results. The details 
must be left to your administrator, the keeper. So 
long as you have a good show of birds, allowing for 
variation of seasons, your ground is well burnt, and 
all the other details well looked after, keep and reward 
him as much as you can. But if the totals begin to fall 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 223 

gradually year by year, the heather remains long and 
old, the driving slack and listless, and you are puzzled 
to account for the deterioration of your moor, change 
your whole staff of keepers, tell your new ones that 
you expect certain results and mean to have them, 
and in a year or two you will probably be astonished 
to find how the grouse have taken to your ground 
again. 

On high moors you are liable to lose a great many 
birds by their leaving the ground for lower ranges in 
severe weather. It is quite worth while to feed them 
a little at such times. It is chiefly when the snow is 
caked or frozen over with a very thin coating of ice, 
and they cannot scratch through it to get food, that 
they are most pinched and may leave the ground, 
never to come back. I remember Mr. Walter Stan- 
hope ' telling me that in the very hard winter of 
1859-60 the grouse on his Dunford Bridge moors 
left the ground in hundreds ; many were killed in the 
fields in a half-starved state, and even one or two in 
the barrack square at Sheffield, some fifteen miles off. 
He then sent men up to the moor with long rakes, and

presented one of the divisions of the West Riding in Parliament. 
An admirable letter from his pen is given in the Badminton 
Library, S/i ooting> vol. ii. p. 1 1, describing some of the earliest 
methods and results of driving grouse. 



224 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



as they raked the snow off the grouse followed them 
close, as gulls will follow the plough, or chickens the 
good-wife in the poultry yard, perfectly tame. 

Your keepers should see to these methods of help- 
ing them to feed in severe weather, and not, as is too 
often the case, helplessly gape at the half-starved 
packs sitting on walls or scratching at the ground in 
the fields below the moorland, until, forced by hunger, 
they rise and fly clean away in search of milder 
conditions. 

The same authority (Mr. Stanhope) always ex- 
pressed himself in favour of plantations round and 
about the edges of the moors. Though they may 
attain no value as timber, they will prove a great pro- 
tection to the grouse in a heavy snow. Then they will 
be able to creep under the boughs of the stunted 
larches or spruces, scratching and picking a bit when 
they cannot get at food or shelter on the open moor. 
Grouse, I believe, very rarely die of cold, excepting the 
devoted hens, which sometimes allow themselves to 
be frozen, or so pinched by the cold while sitting on 
their nests that they succumb within a short time. But 
they suffer severely from starvation in hard winters, 
and although their moving off the ground in large 
packs in search of food may, as Mr. Rimington Wilson 
has observed, serve to mingle the blood and improve 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 225 

the breeding stock on the ground they move to, it will 
hardly benefit you on the deserted high ground, as 
few of them, if any, are likely to return. Grouse 
travel much longer distances than is generally sup- 
posed, and I am firmly convinced that many a Scotch 
bird has been killed well on this side of the border. 
Lord Huntingfield is said to have seen a pack of 
grouse flying over his place in Norfolk. I have not 
his lordship's word for it, but have often heard it from 
friends of his, and certainly his authority would be 
indisputable, after the many hundreds his unerring 
aim has accounted for. 1 

Mr. Rimington Wilson, in an admirable letter to 
the ' Field ' of September 10, 1892, gives four principal 
points to be attended to in the management of a 
moor : 

1. Heather burning. 

2. Driving v. shooting in other ways. 

3. Keeping down vermin. 

4. Sheep, &c. 

To these 1 would add : 

5. Watchful protection against poachers. 

6. Feeding &C. in hard weather. 

1 1 have only shot one week with Lord Hunlinglield. His 
accuracy was marvellous, while never appearing to take a long 
shot. It was a very pretty lesson, and one which I am proud 
to have learnt. 



SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



7. Planting round and upon lower parts of your 
moor. 

As regards burning, it is instructive to find Mr. 
Wilson, Lord Walsingham, and the Mackintosh (see 
p. 156) all agreed as to the necessity of this system 
in order to keep the heather in a healthy condition. 
Mr. Wilson believes in burning altogether any large 
tract of deep old heather, though as a general rule 
the moor should be burnt in strips. Where possible 
these should run parallel with your lines of butts. 
He remarks also on the splendid stretches of young 
heather following on an accidental fire. I have 
noticed the same myself, and fully agree with him 
that most moors are not severely enough burned. 
The old heather is always damp underneath, affords 
no healthy food for grouse or sheep, and is abominable 
to walk through. Artistically speaking, I regret that 
I must give my verdict in favour of systematic burn- 
ing, while, practically, I must own that it is absolutely 
essential for the healthy condition of the grouse. On 
a moor that is exclusively ' dogged ' it must be burnt 
in patches, so that the young birds, feeding on the 
very young shoots, may have close to them the resort 
of good cover in an older patch, and avoid being 
driven off their feed by the older birds, and that they 
may thus be more evenly distributed over the ground. 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 227 

On driving v. shooting over dogs I have already 
delivered myself in other chapters of this volume, 
but must again quote Mr. Wilson : ' It is, perhaps, 
superfluous to remark that to make a moor as pro- 
ductive as possible shooting over dogs ought to 
be allowed to a very limited extent, if at all. The 
candle should not be burnt at both ends' 

A certain number of sheep will do no harm upon a 
moor, but too many will do a great deal; while cattle 
and horses will always cause the heather to deteriorate, 
and a coarse, rank kind of grass to spring up, which 
is not good for pasture and useless for grouse. Here, 
again, liberality and a kindly feeling to the shepherds 
will do more for your stock than anything. They 
have it in their hands to injure if not to cripple your 
sport altogether. Their dogs can destroy in an hour 
in the breeding season what would give you a good 
day's driving later on. But I have always found them 
a kindly and simple race of people, and if well treated 
they will see that their flocks do not trample on the 
nests or young birds, and that their dogs do not 
career wildly over the moor during the nesting period. 
They are really your best and most loyal grouse- 
keepers if you enlist them on your side; and besides 
so ordering their work on the hills as not to injure 
the grouse, they can render immense assistance to 



228 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



your keepers in the tracking of vermin, detection of 
poaching, and other such matters, besides sometimes 
lending willing and skilful aid to the management 
of your drives. Moral : above all things be kind 
and liberal to the shepherds and farmers. 

Mr. Wilson omits to mention protection against 
poaching, though his moors lie in a country where it 
is well understood ; but I think I can account for 
this. I said above that good keepers always have a 
good show of game ; and certainly his head man, Ward, 
is an excellent example of this. A past master in 
the art of driving, his is also a name of terror to 
poachers, and in the security which so loyal a servant 
inspires, Mr. Wilson may well have forgotten how 
little his boundaries might be respected were they 
under less formidable protection. 

In addition to feeding the birds and raking off 
the frozen snow in winter, I would endorse what the 
Mackintosh says as to the improvement of the water 
supply by puddling up the streams, and making many 
little reservoirs, so as to insure the birds plenty to 
drink in a very dry breeding season, such as we ex- 
perienced last year (1893). 

Vermin must be thoroughly kept down, and on 
Scotch moors, terminating as they mostly do in high 
rocky ground, it is no easy work to keep in check the 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 229 

depredations of foxes, crows, jackdaws, eagles, ravens, 
stoats, weasels, hawks of all kinds, and even occasion- 
ally wild cats, or cats which have become wild and 
taken to the rocks and ravines. I would never kill 
an eagle, but rather keep so grand a bird on the best 
my moor provided, nor would I, personally, shoot a 
peregrine; but the other species I have named, besides 
being less picturesque, are less rare, and must be 
' attended to.' The anti-game-law party in Scotland 
lately started the cry that the destruction of hawks, 
owls &C. had subjected them to a plague of field 
voles (the common little brown mouse so often seen 
on the hills), and that these creatures were devouring 
their pastures, and impoverishing their stock ; but a 
perusal of the evidence before the Royal Commission 
on this subject will, I think, convince any reasonable 
person that the appearance of these animals in large 
numbers in particular localities has been of spasmodic 
recurrence from time immemorial, and that when 
they appear hawks and owls usually appear also in 
increased numbers to keep them in check. They seem 
to leave certain districts, or die off, as erratically and 
as rapidly as they appear, and the agitators failed 
altogether to connect their appearance with the de- 
struction of vermin by gamekeepers. 

i'oaching, dishonesty, and disloyalty, encouraged 



230 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

as they are by the unscrupulousness of the receivers 
of stolen and illegally killed game in the large towns, 
are after all the things most to be guarded against, and 
I have endeavoured to indicate how I think they may 
best be combated. I have before me a working model 
of the nets used in Yorkshire, with poles, clips &c. 
complete, as well as a fair selection of specimens of 
snares ; but I think that the accurate description of 
how all such engines should be used is against the 
interests of sport, and may serve only to encourage 
poaching by diffusing the science of how to do it. 
Wherever there is good moorland, well watered and 
with plenty of sheltered places, there ought to be a 
good stock of grouse. Laziness is much more 
common among hill keepers than where population 
is more dense, while the climate of Scotch glens, 
especially on the west coast, tends to enervate men. 
The great antidote for this is to be constantly on the 
high ground in the fresher air, as you will discover for 
yourself during a long stay in Scotland. Your head 
man should, therefore, see that his assistants are con- 
stantly on the moor looking after the welfare of the 
birds ; instead of giving way, as they often do, to the 
temptation of merely gazing at it from below all day, 
and leaving it to take care of itself all night. 

The great and mysterious plague known as the 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 231 

grouse disease is the most powerful enemy to be 
fought against. I cannot agree that it is due to 
overcrowding and here again I turn to the Mackin- 
tosh and Mr. Rimington Wilson for corroboration. 
Mr. Wilson writes me : 'Since about 1870 there has 
been no disease on these moors sufficiently severe to 
prevent shooting ; previous to this date disease seems 
to have recurred severely and regularly about every 
seven years. There is no doubt that driving has pro- 
duced this healthier state of affairs.' The Mackintosh 
writes : ' On the Moy Hall moor there has been 
practically no disease since 1873. Driving was first 
resorted to in 1869, and only then when birds were 
too wild to sit to dogs ; ' but he adds that it was not 
seriously taken up until 1872. 

In considering these two statements we must bear 
in mind that the former is an undoubted authority on 
Yorkshire driving of over twenty years' standing, on 
whose moors all the English records have been 
eclipsed ; and that the latter is the most successful 
exponent of the adoption of the system in Scotland, 
and holds the record for the latter country. I might 
add that to my certain knowledge, where good 
management prevails, many other moors have yielded 
a fair proportion of birds even in the years when 
disease has been reported severe and prevalent over 



232 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



both Scotland and England. What are we to think of 
those moors, which have been let to a variety of 
tenants for twenty years, and where nothing but the 
old-fashioned system of exclusive 'dogging' in the 
early part of the season has ever been practised, which 
are almost annually reported as having suffered 
severely from disease, and have produced gradually 
declining results ? Is it too much to agree with autho- 
rities such as I have quoted, and to come to the con- 
clusion that other causes besides disease have been at 
work on these unfortunate moors ? I think not ; and 
it will take a great deal to convince me that good 
grouse ground can deteriorate to this extent for no 
visible cause except the eternal cry of ' disease.' The 
birds on ill-preserved ground are never good spe- 
cimens of the race. A deer-forest grouse is not, 
as a rule, to be compared, for weight, plumage, 
or flavour to one from Studley or Wemmergill. If 
the Scotch keeper on such ground does not learn by 
more direct channels, he will eventually discover by 
the depreciated value of the moor which he manages 
that he or his predecessors have killed the grouse with 
the golden eggs. A pound a brace or even more has 
been, and is still, paid by the unwary who rent certain 
Scotch shootings ; but a Yorkshire moor which yields 
3,000 brace, though very scarce in the market, will 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 233 

not fetch 3,ooo/. for the season. Those who take the 
average shooting, and wish for a moderate amount of 
sport at a moderate expense, should look more closely 
than they do into the records of the moor, should 
submit to no clauses in their lease which oblige them 
to keep on any particular keeper or nominee of the 
landlord, and should study more closely the methods 
which have been adopted on the moors where a really 
successful result is shown. 

The exact nature of the grouse disease is very 
difficult to determine. Lord Walsingham, some years 
since, offered a considerable money prize for the best 
essay on the subject ; but the result was unsatisfactory, 
and no one, if I recollect rightly, offered a solution 
worthy to receive the reward. Dr. Cobbold's pam- 
phlet still remains as the only scientific effort offering 
a tangible solution of the question. He ascribes it 
all to the Strongylus pergracilis, a little thread-like 
worm which breeds in the throat, and eventually in 
thousands in all the organs of the bird. It is further 
alleged that ponies and sheep had died on the moors 
during years when disease was prevalent from the 
attacks of the same parasite. But not even I )r. Cob- 
bold can tell us whence or how the Strongylus pcr- 
gracilis is produced, or whether it is the cause or 
effect of weakness in the larger body. I remember, 



234 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



in 1874 or thereabouts, on the late Sir Charles 
Forbes's moors at Dalradample, in Aberdeenshire, 
we were all taking refuge on a wet stormy day in one 
of the butts for luncheon. I sat on a seat in the 
corner, made of sods cut from the moor, and when I 
rose, found on my mackintosh and on the sod under 
me a quantity of small thread-like worms, answering 
exactly to Dr. Cobbold's description of the Strongylus. 
On examination, I found many others under where 
others of the party were lying or sitting, as though 
the warmth of their bodies had drawn these creatures 
to the surface. The particular growth they were in 
was not heather, but the coarse grass, reddish at the 
tips, so common on the moors and rough hill pas- 
tures. I put several of them carefully into a bottle 
with bits of the grass, intending to send them to 
Lord Walsingham, as one of our first entomologists, 
for examination ; but, alas ! by next morning they 
were all dried up and almost invisible dead, and 
shrivelled to nothing. 

This seemed to show that they were produced, 
supposing them to be identical with Cobbold's para- 
site, on certain ground, and prevalent, like the field 
voles, at spasmodic intervals. I was much disappointed 
at my failure to get a scientific opinion, but commend 
this experience to those who would pursue the subject 



GROUND, STOCK, AND POACHING 235 

seriously. I should add that the ground was very 
damp, and that the weather had been very wet for 
some weeks previously. 

I believe that no remedy has ever been hit on 
or tried with any satisfactory result. Rock salt has 
been suggested ; but this does not appear to commend 
itself to the grouse. I have always thought that if it 
were practicable and not too expensive the heather 
might, as an experiment, be sown with salt, in case the 
parasite is really generated first upon the ground. I 
am sure that very little would suffice to kill worms such 
as I found on the occasion mentioned, and it might 
prove beneficial as against tapeworms in their young or 
embryo condition. So far as we know at present, we 
can only fight against the disease, or ward it off, by the 
common-sense practice of regular heather burning, and 
maintaining a vigorous race of birds by the methods 
and management I have mentioned above, aided by 
such suggestions as those who have long and practical 
experience of moois and moor-game can furnish in 
addition. 

I have alluded above to accidental fires. These 
may do no harm, possibly some eventual good, when 
the ground is somewhat damp and the weather broken, 
as in spring ; but in very hot dry weather in the 
summer they may prove very serious. At such times 



236 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



take every precaution against casual fires being lighted, 
and request your guests to be careful with matches, 
and also to watch that sparks from the gun do not 
start a conflagration. I set my butt on fire three 
times in one day at Studley, and only extinguished it 
with considerable difficulty. 

On these very moors, in 1872, the most disastrous 
moorland fire ever known took place. The fire de- 
stroyed 1,300 acres of the best of the ground, going 
eight or ten feet deep into the peat, and the smoke of 
it was perceptible for thirty or forty miles. I have 
not been on this ground lately, but can vouch for the 
fact that, ten years after the fire, the vast expanse of 
the ' burnt ground ' on Studley moor remained black 
and barren, a warning of what the careless lighting of 
a match may do in hot weather.

CHAPTER VI 

' THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR ' 

MR. JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS has in his delightful 
book, ' Game Birds and Shooting Sketches,' given a 
description of bird and animal life in the early morn- 
ing on the lower edges of the moorland, and this, 
with many other passages in the work, I commend to 
those who love the poetry of nature. A son of the 
great painter whose tender and masterly touch alone 
seems able to grasp the realities and idealities, the 
romances or complexities, which go to make up the life 
of this age, he develops, as one of the first naturalists 
of to-day, a convincing admiration for nature and a 
brilliant power of drawing birds inheritances of his 
father's talents. 

From Sir John, my earliest master in outdoor 
painting, 1 I am not ashamed to have stolen the title 
of this chapter, in order to describe the picturesque 

1 I believe I may claim the honour of being the only pupil 
Sir J. Millais ever had alas ! for too short a time. 



238 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



and varied ground which, lying next to or forming 
part of the moorland proper, leads you by the plea- 
santest of transitions to the cultivated land. This is 
the Bohemia of shooting the tract where we have 
all spent some of the pleasantest of our days in cir- 
cumventing its distinctive denizens, or in making a 
mixed bag without the aid of the organisation of a 
regular shooting party. Here sits the capercailzie 
and lurks the roe ; here abides the blackcock and 
crouches the hare ; here stalks the pheasant and 
sleeps the woodcock ; while from above and below 
the grouse and the partridge meet on the heathery 
slopes and rushy bottoms of this debatable land, the 
fringe of the moor. 

Driving the woods for black-game and anything 
else that may be in them provides the pleasantest of 
shooting days, liberally tinged with the element of 
surprise, which is as essentially an integral part of 
sport as it is admitted to be of wit. I quite agree 
with the late Mr. Bromley-Davenport, than whom no 
better sportsman ever rode, shot, or fished, that it is 
hateful to know exactly how much game there is in a 
covert, how many birds in a turnip field. All interest 
is gone the moment the element of uncertainty or 
surprise is removed. The great charm of the moor 
edge is its variety. The long plantation of larch or 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 239 



fir, standing ankle-deep in yellow grass or breast-high 
in bracken, breaks imperceptibly into a bed of heather, 
dotted with young trees, which in turn gives way to 
swampy hollows or rushy wastes, not infrequently 
bordering a field or two of stubble or turnips before 
the wood or moor begins again. Small coverts, great 
open brakes of fern, and deep ravines where the 
heather can scarce cling to the steep sides between 
the rocks, succeed each other in delightful confusion, 
the whole forming an agglomeration of various sorts 
of covert, which used to be called by the old keeper 
at Drumlanrig ' by the expressive term of ' what- 
nots.' 

Many charming days have I enjoyed in years 
gone by among those ' what-nots,' where sometimes 
twelve or thirteen varieties of game, from the fallow 
deer to the jack-snipe, were killed in one day, and 
great were the numbers of the black-game. The two 
distinct kinds of black-game driving are determined 
by the nature of the ground. In the one your com- 
pany of well-organised drivers sweeps a succession of 
so-called pastures, though the herbage on them is 
not of the best, differing but little, except for the 

1 Drumlanrig Castle in Dumfriesshire, the principal seat of 
the Duke of liuccleuch, which stands un an estate of 175,000 
acres. 



240 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

frequently intersecting stone walls and marked in- 
closures, from the moor itself. In the other, some- 
times with an imposing but casual array of beaters, 
suggesting somewhat the levies of a pretender or 
an outlaw, but more often with the unaided skill 
of a half-dozen of keepers and gillies, the woods are 
ranged towards you as you stand in carefully selected 
spots, 'passes' where the blackcocks are sure to 
cross, and where you are equally on the look-out for 
a woodcock or a roebuck. 

The former style of black-game driving has been 
undoubtedly carried to the greatest perfection, and 
with the best results, on the Duke of Buccleuch's 
Dumfriesshire estates. Here, at Sanquhar or Wan- 
lock Head, lie the great stretches of rough pasture 
part grass, part rushes, part heather which favour a 
great stock of these birds, and which, lying between 
the oat stubbles and the luxuriant heather, afford 
them the variety of food that this specie seem in 
particular to affect. Here, ensconced behind a high 
wall, after, perhaps, removing the topmost course 
of stones to clear your view in front, having reached 
your places in strictly enforced silence, and weighed 
the consequences of any mistake, such as killing a 
greyhen or showing yourself unduly, which may ex- 
pose you to a fire of time-honoured chaff, you may 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 241 



see a pack of a hundred or more blackcocks coming 
straight at your face, and on about the same level 
a sight never to be forgotten, and one that makes 
your heart beat faster and your hand tremble lest you 
bring ridicule upon yourself by missing these great 
ponderous objects as they come by you so close that 
you could almost touch them. The missing is easier 
than you would think, and we all know who have 
tried it how simple it is to shoot behind a black- 
cock, looking as big as a turkey, and seeming to 
be going very slow, within fifteen or twenty yards. 
Nothing will avail you but absolute confidence in 
your own shooting powers and a complete disregard 
of the disturbing personality of the quarry. You 
must shoot as at a driven partridge, if anything a 
shade more forward, and with more rather than less 
accuracy. With these precautions you will strike the 
bird in the head and neck, and he will collapse as 
easily as the aforesaid partridge. Without them, or 
if you should vainly try to kill two or three at a shot, 
you will inevitably miss altogether, or see your bird 
flinch and disappear, as you think, ' cut to ribbons.' 
This means that he will fly half a mile, rise again 
about fifty yards in front of your dog, and gaily fly 
on, never to be seen again ; or wheel round and re- 
turn contemptuously over your head, at the height 

R 



242 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



of the cross on St. Paul's Cathedral, to the ground 
whence he was first disturbed. 

Black-game have wonderful turning power, and it 
is a sight to see them, when they are driven down a 
heavy wind and suspect or are sure of danger in front, 
wheel deliberately round and go up wind over the 
drivers in the teeth of half a gale. For this reason it is 
necessary to observe silence as you move to your post 
and after you have reached it ; even smoking being 
in some places prohibited. The great thing is to get 
the main body, the large pack or packs over the guns, 
scatter them to a certain extent, and at any rate utilise 
them for the next drive. 

To insure this you must also be careful not to 
show yourself, bearing in mind that they are quite 
capable of turning completely round and going back 
when within a few yards of you, and that when they 
have accomplished this you have done with that 
particular lot for the day. 

The first bird or two that comes by you should 
spare ; they will probably be greyhens, flushed by the 
drivers at the start ; but do not despise this warning, 
as should they come against a bright sky, or should you 
be unduly keen, you may find that you have incurred 
the penalty of error. I suppose that no one who 
has shot black-game has not made this mistake 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 243 



more than once ; therefore, I advise you, always let 
the first bird or two pass you before firing, as after 
they get level with you it is easy to distinguish the 
cock from the hen. Should you know that there is a 
large lot of cocks between the guns and the drivers, 
the first odd birds, whether cocks or hens, should 
always be allowed to pass without a shot being fired, so 
that the main body may come on without suspicion of 
danger. 

This applies when driving woods, but is seldom 
likely to be rigorously followed, as you will then be 
probably anxious to secure the mixed bag which 
the coverts afford. But in driving on the open moor 
or pastures it is absolutely essential, if you are going 
for a bag of blackcocks exclusively, to follow these 
tactics. 

In grouse driving, especially on broken ground, I 
am in favour of the beaters making some noise, for 
birds seated in hollows or anywhere out of sight of the 
flags, having heard the guns ahead and not being con- 
scious of the presence of the drivers, may rise and 
turn back. But for black-game driving I recommend 
absolute silence, as if too much scared they will 
get high up and leave the ground you are working, 
often crossing a broad deep valley and alighting on 
a far-off hill, clean off your day's ground. For black- 



244 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



game driving no flags are necessary, or at the most 
one or two for men posted on the flank to prevent the 
birds taking some particular line away from the drive. 

Driving them from the woods is almost entirely a 
question of judicious placing of the guns ; the keeper 
should know the points or ' passes ' where they 
almost invariably break from a particular covert, and 
here the guns should be placed pretty close together. 
As this conduces to talking, silence must again be 
urged in waiting for these birds, the fact that they 
drive best up wind furnishing an additional reason for- 
the exercise of caution and self-control. 

Walking the woods and broken ground in line in 
late September or early October is a very pretty form 
of sport, though the line is very difficult to keep in 
proper formation. Here you get very unexpected and 
difficult shots, a blackcock rising with a great rattle 
out of a little ravine being a customer whom it requires 
some skill to stop. ' At this time of year the cocks are 
found singly, scattered about the woods, seeking the 
various berries and grasses which they like as a change 
from heather, and some of them will lie very close. 
But they are then mostly young cocks ; so that for the 
good of your breeding stock it is better not to pursue 
them too closely in this fashion. The same remark 
applies even more strongly to attacking the young 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 245 



broods during the last days of August. At this time the 
cockney sportsman, having noted in the almanac that on 
August 20 ' Black-game shooting begins,' sallies forth, 
and decimates the immature pullets, none of which 
will fly far, while nearly all could be caught by the 
hand in the thick heather after the dog has ascertained 
their whereabouts. The old cock he probably never 
sees, or if he does he misses him, and the old hen 
most likely escapes also. Having done as much 
harm as it is possible to do in the day, he will return 
and indite an account of his prowess to the ' Field ; ' 
quaintly remarking that he ' had i8| brace of black- 
game ' on the 2oth. Since he clearly need not have 
shot the majority of them, and should be ashamed of 
himself if he did, the fact that he possessed them is 
perhaps all that need be recorded. But it may be 
added that a young blackcock whom you happen upon 
' in the way of business ' is, if you let him get far 
enough before putting shot into him, one of the most 
delicious of all birds for the table. 

Stalking black-game, whether on the stocks of corn, 
or later on the open moor and pastures, is a very 
agreeable art, and one which will try your skill and 
sportsmanlike qualities to the utmost. Foul weather, 
when it is hardly fit to be out, is the best for this. 
You will then find the old cocks, which should always 



246 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



be the object of your pursuit, sitting on walls or 
mounds, and other bare dry places. The wind must 
be very carefully considered, and the stalk conducted 
with as much care as if you were after deer. If you 
alarm other birds or beasts, the blackcocks, like deer, 
will take alarm also, and though their sense of smell 
is not so keen as, their eyesight is undoubtedly superior 
to, that of the nobler animal. It is often a good plan 
to employ your man, always granted that you can 
trust his discretion, to move about at a distance, and 
in a different direction, so as to distract their wary 
eyes while you creep upon them. As chances are 
few at this sport, and it is important to kill these old 
stagers, who live to an immense age, long after they 
have become utterly useless for stud purposes, I 
would advise you never to spare a sitting shot. 

Of capercailzie shooting there is not much to be 
said. It is no doubt a beautiful sight to see these 
magnificent birds sailing past you as you stand in a 
clearing of the wood, and a very satisfactory thing to 
bring them down stone dead, as you can do if you hit 
them well forward. But as their flight is not long, 
the drives are not exciting, and beautiful as the bird 
may be he is not fit to eat in any shape but soup. 
Whatever you may do, the capercailzie will leave 
your ground or remain on it as they list, selecting their 



THE FRINGE OF THE MOOR' 247 

favourite trees for residence, and being found perched 
there with monotonous regularity. They do not seem 
to acquire in Scotland (the only part of the British 
Islands where they can be found) even the wildness 
of habit which makes the pursuit of them so exciting 
in Germany and Austria. But as they that is, the 
cocks only, for a hen is never shot are only pursued 
in the latter countries in the breeding season, and are, 
in fact, slain in the act of carolling forth the song of 
love, I confess to but little sympathy for the sport. 

But when you have to deal with one that is driven 
to you, be not deceived by his size or the com- 
paratively slow beat of his wings. He is going fully 
as fast as a blackcock or a grouse, and unless you 
hit him in the head you need not trouble to fire. I 
once missed five old cocks in one drive, none of them 
more than thirty-five yards off, from misjudging their 
pace, and probably also in some degree their distance 
from me. All that can be said about them has been 
admirably put by Mr. Millais in his book ' and by 
Lord Charles Kerr in the Badminton Library. '- 

Last, but not least, we must breathe the keen air 
and tread the summer snows of the high tops, while 
we attack the shy and graceful ptarmigan.

248 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



The glorious scenery which surrounds the haunts 
of these beautiful .birds makes the pursuit of them 
especially fascinating. The splendid air and brilliant 
light, the panoramic view, the shifting cloud and mist, 
the dizzy height and wondrous silence these weird 
surroundings are so fine that we almost forget our 
wish to slay the creatures that inhabit them, and pro- 
bably few men have descended from the ptarmigan 
hill in the evening without a pang of regret at 
having carried their predatory instinct into these 
picturesque solitudes. 

At first you cannot see the birds against the stones, 
so closely do they resemble the pale grey rock, white 
spa, and speckled moss which form their background ; 
but presently they move and run before you, seeming 
quite tame, but fifteen yards away. In another second 
they are all in the air together, their white wings flash- 
ing in the sun, they have doubled in a bunch along 
the hill, and now, well separated from one another, are 
sailing away at a terrific pace, while you sorrowfully 
eject your empty and profitless cartridge cases. You 
must advance upon them with the gun held ready, 
almost up to the shoulder, and as they all turn toge- 
ther, the killing moment, try and knock over a brace 
cleverly, though the second bird will take you all you 
know to stop. 



FRINGE OF THE A/OOA" 249 

They always rise all together and close to one 
another, and many people, otherwise scrupulous 
sportsmen, will, as they turn, shoot into the brown, or 
rather the ' white,' of the covey. This I think horribly 
cruel and unfair, specially so in the case of ptarmigan, 
for a wounded bird who may fly across a valley 
which it would take you four hours of descent and 
ascent to cross, is more often than not never retrieved, 
but left to linger in a rift between the rocks, or fall a 
victim on the mossy slopes to the eagle, the raven, or 
the fox. 

In beating a round hill, it is a good plan to 
separate and work round it in two parties, when 
you will send some beautiful rocketing shots from one 
to the other ; but your guns must be accurate, careful 
shots, or as you approach to meet again you may 
easily shoot one another. The handling of the gun 
altogether demands experience and closer attention 
on ptarmigan ground than on any other. The footing 
is often bad, and slips over loose stones are frequent, 
while the possibility of blinding one of the party by 
a ricochet off the rocks must always be borne in mind. 
The best way to carry the gun on such ground, wher- 
ever possible, is in the right hand only, thrown back, 
with the barrels resting on your right shoulder and the 
hand on the grip. Then, should you fall, your piece 



250 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

will fall forward as you extend your arm, and should a 
jar discharge it, will probably do no harm. But when 
there is anyone in front of you, it is obvious this 
method of carrying the gun becomes the most unsafe, 
and you must harden your heart and be prepared to 
lose here and there a chance by carrying it at half- 
cock carefully nursed over your left arm, while you 
are clinging to the steep face or picking your way 
among loose stones. 

Ptarmigan can be driven, though to do it to a 
profitable extent there should be a great stock of them, 
and an elaborate organisation becomes necessary. The 
ground they inhabit is so steep that the drivers must 
usually be sent up by a different route from the guns, 
and unless the whole thing is very carefully arranged 
the drive is likely to fail of its result. There are 
usually only a few broods on a particular hill, and I 
think, if you are not too hard upon them (for on certain 
days it is possible to kill almost every bird you see), 
it is a better and pleasanter way to walk the ground 
for them. Pointers or setters you will hardly require, 
though here and there, especially for finding a wounded 
bird, they will be useful. But the blue hares, which 
are usually pretty well sprinkled over the ptarmigan 
ground, are trying to your dogs, and you can be 
pretty sure of finding the birds without them. 



' THE FRINGE OF THE MOO A" 251 

Ptarmigan, like all other birds, are much in- 
fluenced by the wind, and should your march run 
along the top of the hill it is useless to go out unless 
the wind favours their lying on your side ; otherwise 
every bird on the hill will be over the march, and 
though you may get a splendid walk, you will make 
but a poor bag of either birds or hares. 

Where possible, separate into two parties, so as to 
drive birds to one another, and in this way each party 
is likely to be of service to the other in retrieving 
wounded birds. The valleys, which they cross in a 
few seconds and with consummate ease, are almost a 
day's work for men to traverse ; and somehow the 
idea of leaving these beautiful birds to a lingering 
death in their own wild home is peculiarly repugnant 
to the feelings of a good sportsman. 

To revert to the lower ground, I think that 
where you have, in addition to grouse, a large stock 
of black-game, the interests of the farmers should be 
borne in mind. There is no doubt that when the 
corn is standing in stocks a large flock of these birds, 
visiting the fields every night and morning, will 
destroy a large amount of grain. You will find your- 
self all the more popular in the glen if you visit them 
on off days when keen on this food, and a beautiful 
afternoon's sport may be enjoyed by lying in wait for 



252 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



them as they come from the moor to the corn-land. 
Black-game if disturbed once or twice on their feed 
will be chary of returning to the same place for a 
space of time, and the farmer will be found very 
grateful to you if, while enjoying a pleasant variety of 
sport, you show some anxiety to protect his produce 
from these voracious visitors. 

I regret to have to record my opinion that the 
decrease in the numbers of black-game in Scotland 
is due entirely to illegal destruction of these birds. 
They are easily poached, and since the poulterers 
have been suffered to expose them for sale during the 
spring and summer months as ' Norwegian,' the 
diminution in the general stock has become very 
marked. No one should buy or eat black-game from 
Christmas until the following August. \Yhether they 
come from Norway or not, they are not in season ; 
they must have been destroyed during the period 
when every animal but the lowest vermin should be 
let alone, and have never been come by in the honest 
ways of sport.

CHAPTER VII 

RECORDS AND REMARKS 

ALL the British shooting world now knows that 
a man can kill 500 brace of grouse to his own gun 
in one day given the accuracy, the physique, the 
endurance, and the grouse necessary since the feat 
has been performed by an Englishman on his own 
moor in Yorkshire. We also know that 1,000 brace 
and upwards to a party of well-selected shots is a 
performance we may always expect to hear of in 
a good grouse season, and that it has been done 
already several times in the same county. We 
further know that 500 brace can be killed in a day 
in Scotland, since it was done last year (1893) in 
Inverness-shire ; and in none of these cases are we 
sure that the limit of possibility has been reached. 

To defend large bags is always a difficult task, 
since they must generally appear unnatural and un- 
sportsmanlike to persons who have no experience 
of well-organised and accurate shooting on strictly 



254 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



preserved ground ; and, be it observed, it is only from 
such as these that the attack ever comes. Such 
experience and study as I have been able to bring to 
bear on the subject convinces me that the more 
grouse there are on the moors, the more partridges in 
the fields, and the more pheasants in the coverts, the 
better for everybody in this struggling age. We ought 
to rejoice in the discovery that by good manage- 
ment the food-producing power of the moors, no less 
than their opportunities for healthy pleasure and 
exercise, can be increased to such a pitch. If the 
grouse are there, it is clear they must be killed to be 
utilised as food, and surely no one would advocate their 
being destroyed by means of nets or other engines in 
the wholesale manner of the poacher or poulterer. It 
is evident the results cannot be obtained by the old- 
fashioned methods, since where these have been 
abandoned the stock has so much increased that it 
would no longer be possible to deal with the birds 
except by organised driving. 

I have never been one of those who have cavilled 
at Lord Walsingham's unique performance. Records 
must and will continue to be broken by Englishmen 
until the limit is reached, and it seems to me far 
better that everyone should know the extraordi- 
nary value and fecundity of well-preserved moors.

WALSINGHAM. 

September 20, 1888. 



Although the result has been published, I do 
not think any previous work contains this account of 
the details. The small pick-up, 34 birds out of a 
total of 1,056 only about 3 per cent., testifies to clean 
killing and humane and careful gathering of wounded ; 
while the hours occupied and proportion of kills to 
misses are sufficient to show that to produce the 
performance a man must be a first-rate sportsman and 
athlete. 

Here is the account of two days at Mr. Rimington 
Wilson's, on the Broomhead moors near Sheffield, last 
year (1893). The first constitutes the record bag for 
one day's grouse shooting :

The second day's driving was over the same batteries and 
the same ground as the first. 

Both days fine and wir>d favourable. 

1,910 grouse picked up by luncheon on the 3oth. 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 257 

Mr. Wilson also held the record previous to this 
day viz. 2,626 grouse, killed at Broomhead on 
September 6, 1872, by thirteen guns, including the 
late Mr. J. W. Rimington Wilson, one of the finest 
shots and most accomplished men of his time, and his 
two sons, who took outside places all day. The most 
recent record, as given above, to nine guns, is of course 
by far the more remarkable of the two. 

Here, again, are some of the results of the well- 
known Wemmergill moor, kindly furnished me by 
Lord Westbury, who has rented it almost ever since 
Sir Frederick Milbank gave it up. He says : ' For 
the last seven years this moor, which is under 12,000 
acres, has yielded an average of over 6,000 birds a 
year ; this period includes two very bad seasons viz. 
1891, when only 1,826 birds were killed, and 1892, 
when there was no shooting.' 

This average is 50 per cent higher than that 
of Sir Frederick Milbank during his twelve years' 
tenancy of the same moor, viz. 4,133 birds, although 
his period includes the exceptional total of 17,064 in 
1872 ; ] Lord Westbury's highest year being 9,797 in 
1888. This looks as though the preservation of the 
birds and the ground had reached a more perfect and 
even condition.

On the adjoining moor of High Force enormous 
totals have also been reached, the record of 1872, 
during the Duke of Beaufort's tenancy, showing 15,484 
birds for nineteen days' shooting. On this moor, as 
the guest of the late Mr. Clare Vyner, I took part in 
a wonderful week, averaging over 1,200 birds each 
day for four days, to only six guns. I had the best 
drive I have ever seen, picking up 115 birds in the 
single drive. I had knocked down 145, but owing to 
pressure of time and much thick bracken near my butt, 
which in the heat of an August day gave the dogs, no 
chance, I had to leave thirty birds on the ground, 
most of which, however, came into the pick-up 
announced next day. 

It is curious that Lord de Grey should have also 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 259 



had his biggest drive, 128 birds, later on the same 
day, especially since we have both taken part in 
larger bags than the total of that particular occa- 
sion. 

Lord de Grey, who is admittedly the best game 
shot of our generation, and who has of course 
immense experience, has killed to his own gun 575 
grouse in one day, shooting as one of a party of seven 
guns on the Studley Royal moors. Sir Frederick 
Milbank's performance ' exceeds this in numbers, and 
will probably, as the performance of an individual 
making one of a party of guns, never be surpassed. 
Lord de Grey's view is that, without disparagement 
of any such feat as this or Lord Walsingham's, which 
is only possible to a first-rate man, there is a great 
deal of luck as to whether the chance ever presents 
itself to perform it, and that the general shooting 
throughout a succession of days under every variety of 
condition is the test which the most experienced will 
apply to a man's form. 

It is necessary to notice an exceptional per- 
formance, and to recognise it as such. It is rarely 
achieved but by the first-rate man, and does not alter 
the general conditions which govern the sport in 

1 Badminton Library, Moor anil Marsh, p. 37. 

s 2 



260 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 



question. We can all remember how when Mr. W. 
G. Grace produced a series of scores such as had 
never been dreamt of in the cricket field, people 
began to talk of altering the rules to assist the 
bowlers ; of adding a stump, or narrowing the pro- 
portions of the bat, in order to restore the balance of 
the game. But these scores, like those named above, 
now remain recorded as the meteors or comets in the 
celestial field of great reputations, of rare and spas- 
modic recurrence, and valuable only as a standard of 
possibility to stimulate minor constellations to greater 
brilliancy. 

The first-rate performer, as before remarked, is 
good under all circumstances. I have met those who 
have seen W. G. Grace in a rustic cricket match, or 
John Roberts on a country house table, just as I have 
seen De Grey walking for an ordinary bag of partridges, 
or pursuing the occasional snipe or rabbit. The per- 
formance shows the same excellence under all these 
circumstances, and the quality which excites merely 
pleasure and admiration under the average conditions 
should not produce jealousy or carping criticism when 
reproduced on the rare opportunity which admits of 
the execution of a sensational feat. 

There is no danger of the frequent recurrence of 
Lord Walsingham's 500 brace in a day, of Lord de 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 261 

Grey's 240 partridges in one drive, 1 of John Robert's 
spot-barred break of 1,300 odd, or of Dr. Grace's 
hundreds in an innings. The first-rate form which 
gradually builds up a great reputation is sure on some 
rare occasion, when all conditions are favourable, to 
produce an exceptional or startling feat ; but there is 
no reason on this account to imagine that all the 
ordinary rules of the sport in question are to be sub- 
versed by this meteoric performance, or to deplore the 
fact that the result exceeds what had been foreseen. 
These isolated achievements, properly considered, do 
no harm, but on the contrary merely serve to raise 
the general standard of excellence in all outdoor 
amusements which it has always been the pride of the 
Englishman to maintain before the world. Some 
fifty years ago Colonel Campbell of Monzie made 
bags to his own gun over dogs which have never been 
surpassed, excepting perhaps on one occasion by the 
late Maharajah Duleep Singh.- I do not think any 

1 This is, no doubt, the record for an individual perform- 
ance in a partridge drive ; the feat, which I give on Lord de 
(irey's own authority, was performed by him last year, 1893, 
at Baron de Ilirsch's in Hungary. 

- Colonel Campbell killed in one (.lay in 1843, i84./ brace 
of grouse ; in 1846, 191 brace; and on the authority of 'Hark- 
away ' is said on another day to have killed 222?, brace. 
The Maharajah Uuleep Singh in 1872 bagged 220 brace in 
a day. 



262 SHOOTING THE GROUSE 

bad consequences have followed these rare feats. If 
they have, as is probably the case, stimulated others to 
improve their shooting and the management of their 
moors, they have done more good than harm, and 
merely resulted in an increase in the supply of grouse 
available as food or sport for those who own moor- 
land estates. 

As remarked before, the best black-game ground 
is undoubtedly to be found on the Duke of Buc- 
cleuch's large estates in Dumfriesshire, while on other 
ground in the border counties, as well as in Perth- 
shire and Aberdeenshire, they have been killed in 
considerable numbers. 

The Duke of Buccleuch kindly furnishes me 
with the following totals of the five best years on his 
Drumlanrig Castle property : 



1861 1,586 

1865 1,530 



1869 . . . . . 1,508 [ Black-game 

1870 1,486 

1871 1,429 

These are diminishing totals, as will be observed, 
and I regret to say that his Grace adds that the 
numbers are still growing less, though there is little 
or no poaching on his ground. But I must recur to 
the subject of illegally killed game, and have no 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 263 



hesitation in putting down the diminished numbers 
to the account of the poulterers in London and 
elsewhere. Perhaps some one well acquainted with 
Norway will tell us from what part of that country 
the large supplies with which it is credited come to 
our markets ! 

Here is the best bag ever made on the Duke's 
ground :

the guns including H.R.H. Prince Christian, the late 
Duke of Buccleuch, and eight others. Of the 247 
black-game over 100 brace were cocks, and I fancy 
this constitutes the record bag of these birds. 

In 1874, at Newlands near Langholm, another of 
the Duke's estates on the Border, the present Duke 
and Colonel Francis Cust bagged 98 black-game, Si 
cocks and 17 greyhens, in one day, starting late and 
having only one gun each. The Duke informs me that 
if they had begun earlier and had taken two guns each 



264 SPIGOTING THE GROUSE 



they could easily have killed 60 brace or more. This, 
especially considering the date, October 9, is the 
best day I ever heard of for two guns. 

Of capercailzie, probably no greater quantity 
has ever been killed than on the day mentioned by 
Mr. Millais, 70 in one day, on the Dowager Duchess 
of Athole's ground near Dunkeld ; while the 35 cocks 
shot at Ballinling by a party of whom Mr. Millais was 
one, is seldom, if ever, likely to be equalled. 

These birds having many years ago become 
extinct in this country, were, as is well known, re- 
introduced by the second Marquess of Breadalbane at 
Taymouth, and have spread over most of the lowland 
counties of Scotland. So far as I have seen they keep 
very much to themselves, and I should say without 
doubt contrive to drive away black-game from their 
especial haunts, though they remain on fairly friendly 
terms with pheasants, woodcocks, and other game. 
They have never been found yet on the English side 
of the Border, though black-game have been killed in 
nearly every county in England and Wales, some- 
times within a short distance of London itself. Mr. 
Millais mentions the curious instance of a black- 
cock and a hansom cab coming within the range of 
his acute vision at the same time in the neighbourhood 
of Aldershot. There is only one way to ' transplant 



RECORDS AND REMARKS 265 



these birds into a new country by procuring the eggs 
and putting them into pheasant or partridge nests, the 
former, of course, for choice. But they go where they 
list ; they will not stay if the country does not suit 
them, but will travel for miles until they find congenial 
cover and food, even as they have led me in this little 
work far away from their recognised home and com- 
panions, the heather and the grouse. 



COOKERY OF JHE GROUSE 

BY 

GEORGE SAINTSBURY 



THE COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

I HAVE always regretted (but never so much as 
since I undertook the duty of these chapters) that I 
did not preserve a French book on game and its 
cookery which passed through my hands some years 
ago. The author frankly admitted that grouse do not 
live in France, though black-game of course are found 
there. But he wished to be complete, and moreover, 
as he very justly observed, some of his French readers 
might have one or more brace of grouse sent him by 
an English friend, and then what was he to do ? So 
he gave with great pride what he was pleased to call 
a receipt for ' Grouse a la Dundy.' Dundy, I remem- 
ber, he defined as being not only the gamiest, la plus 
gi/wyeuse, city of Scotland, but also renowned for every 
variety of refinement of taste and luxury superior in 
short to Peebles itself. And the way that they cooked 
grouse in Dundy was but that is exactly what I have 
forgotten. To the best of my memory it was like' 



270 COOKERV OF THE GROUSE 



most French fashions of cooking game a sufficiently 
ingenious method of making the best of any natural 
flavour that the bird might have, and imbuing it with 
a good many others, not at all disagreeable, but super- 
added rather than evolved or assisted, a method useful 
enough for old birds or indifferent birds, but improper 
for others. 

This process could nowhere be more a counsel of 
imperfection than in the case of grouse ; which, I ven- 
ture to think, has of all game birds the most distinct 
and the least surpassable flavour. There are those, 
of course, who will put in claims for others, and this 
is not the place to fight the matter out. I shall only 
say that while nearly all game birds are good, and 
some eminently good, grouse seems to me to be the 
best, to possess the fullest and at the same time the 
least violent flavour to have the best consistency of 
flesh and to present the greatest variety of attractions 
in different parts. It has become almost an affectation 
to speak of the excellence of his back ; let us rather 
say that he is all good back and breast, legs and 
wings. 

Black-game, capercailzie, and ptarmigan are but 
varieties of grouse, and almost everything that applies 
to the red grouse applies to them. Indeed, the ex- 
cellent Baron Brisst characteristically includes both

black-game and capercailzie in saying that there are 
two kinds of coq de bruyere, the one about the size of 
a peacock, the other about the size of a pheasant. 
All three birds, it is scarcely necessary to say, have, 
owing to their habitat and food, a much stronger 
flavour than the red grouse ; and it depends very much 
on the predominance or moderation of this flavour 
whether they are intolerable, tolerable, or excellent. 
Moreover, in the case of two of them at least, English 
estimation of them is wont to be injuriously affected 
by the importation of vast numbers of ptarmigan 
and capercailzie from the North of Europe, without 
the slightest regard to their fitness for food. I have 
seen it stated, indeed, that most of the Norwegian 
capercailzie which are sold in English shops are 
poached by illegal and unsportsmanlike processes, 
at the very time when they are most out of season. 
Ptarmigan soup, however, is quite excellent, and I am 
not sure that even grouse at its best can give points 
to a roast greyhen in good condition. But partly 
because of the strong nature of their food whereof 
pine and juniper shoots and seeds are the chief parts 
and partly because they are stronger flying birds, and 
therefore tougher than the red grouse, black-game 
require even more keeping than that 'estimable vola- 
tile.' The whole tribe, indeed, will bear this process 



272 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



as no other birds will. It was the custom of a hospit- 
able friend of mine in Scotland, who was equally good 
with rod and gun, to keep a supply of grouse hanging 
till he could accompany them with salmon caught in a 
river which was by no means a very early opening one, 
and I never found birds taste better. The less regarded 
members of the grouse tribe will, as I have said, bear 
much longer keeping. Indeed, the best if not the 
only really good capercailzie that I ever tasted had 
been subjected to the indignity of being forgotten. 
He was imported into the Channel Islands by an 
enterprising game dealer ; I bought him, and as the 
house in which I was living had no good larder, I 
asked the man to keep him on his own premises till 
he and we were ready. We promptly forgot all about 
him, and it was several weeks before the shamefaced 
dealer, who was equally oblivious, said one day, ' I'm 
afraid, sir, that capercailzie . . . ! ' Nevertheless we 
had him sent home. It was necessary to amputate 
and discard a considerable part of him, but the rest 
was altogether admirable. 

With all these birds, but especially with ptarmigan, 
dryness is the great thing to be feared when roasting 
them ; and this must be guarded against by liberal 
basting, by jackets of bacon, and in other well-known 
ways, especially, perhaps, by the German method of 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 273 



marinading and larding given below. Except in soup, 
old birds of all the three kinds are very nearly hopeless, 
and should not be attempted. And though in the 
abstract most, if not all, of the methods of what may 
be called applied grouse-cookery are applicable to 
them, it is well to remember that the extremely strong 
flavour above referred to marries itself but awkwardly 
to miscellaneous additions, and is almost impossible 
simply to disguise with them. Indeed, it is noteworthy 
that even French cookery books do not as a rule 
meddle much with the coq de bruyere, but prefer him 
plain. Nor does any of the tribe make a very good 
devil. 'Tickler,' indeed, in "the Nodes Ambrosiaiue, 
avoucheth that even eagle's thigh is good devilled ; but 
the context does not inspire complete confidence in 
the good faith of the sage of Southside at that moment. 
On the whole, it may be laid down that black-game 
and capercailzie (the latter when young and in very 
good condition) are best roasted, ptarmigan stewed or 
converted into soup. But I must own that I have 
eaten roast ptarmigan which left the room (at least 
the bones did) without a stain on their character 
which were ' white birds ' as much metaphorically as 
literally. 

With these preliminary remarks and cautions as 
U) the outlying varieties we may turn to the cooking 

T 



274 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



of grouse proper. For very obvious reasons the anti- 
quarian part of the matter needs but little attention. 
Until railway-and-steamboat-time grouse were any- 
thing but common in London and exceedingly un- 
common in Paris, and the chef of literary tendencies 
was not likely to trouble himself much about them. 
Their rarity in the former place is exemplified in the 
well-known though doubtless apocryphal legend of the 
Highland chieftain who ordered ' grouse and salmon ' 
for his domestics at a London hotel. And the books 
said very little about them. For instance, a lady had 
the great kindness to examine for me a country-house 
collection of cookery books, English, Scotch, French, 
and American, extending to some score of volumes, 
and all printed between 1790 and 1830. They yielded 
practically nothing but the direction 'Roast moor-game 
half an hour : serve with fried bread crumbs, bread 
sauce, and sliced raw onions in a little water in the 
same boat,' and the still more general advice to ' dress 
them like partridges and send them up with currant 
jelly and fried bread crumbs.' It is somewhat interest- 
ing to notice that the onion sauce (or rather salad) here 
suggested is neither more nor less than a degraded 
and barbarous survival of the onion puree which, as 
was noted in the volume on the Partridge in this series, 
Gervase Markham had prescribed for that bird some 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 275 

two centuries earlier. As for the currant jelly I think it 
hardly survives now, but for people who like currant 
jelly with flesh or fowl it is not bad with grouse, while 
as usual cranberry or rowan-berry jelly is better still. 
German and American cooks also sometimes re- 
commend //;//-sauce. But in connection with the 
general direction to ' cook them like partridges ' I am 
tempted to acid two receipts for dressing that bird 
which I did not know at the time of writing on it, but 
which seem admirably adapted to grouse also, and 
which come from the collection referred to above. 
They appear in La Cuisine de Saute, an elaborate 
work in three volumes written by M. Jourdain Le 
Cointe, and revised in the year 1790 by a medical 
practitioner of Montpellier. This latter man of art, by 
the way, seems during that stirring time to have been 
as unpolitically engaged as his brother savant \\\w was 
indifferent to the Revolution because he had an un- 
precedented number of irregular verbs all nicely 
conjugated and written out in his desk. 

The first of these receipts is called a la Sultanc, 
and is described as one of the favourite dishes of 
Venetian cookery ; the other, also asserted to be 
Italian in origin, is a la ccndre. 

For birds a la Sultanc you take four, and sacrifice 
the least promising of the quartette to make i\farcetw

276 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

the other three, with the usual accompaniment of 
mushrooms, anchovies, &c. You then, having stuffed 
the others, lard them not merely with bacon but 
with anchovies and truffles, and roast them before a 
not too fierce fire, basting them till they are two-thirds 
done with good consomme. ' II unit 1'agrement et la 
salubrite,' says of this dish M. Jourdain le Comte or 
the Montpellier doctor, evidently leaning back in his 
chair with a sense of satisfaction after writing the 
words. It would be interesting to try this receipt 
with grouse, and I think it would answer, though I 
should be disposed to omit the anchovies. The other 
manner, a lacendre, contains a slight puzzle to me. It 
is directed that the birds, jacketed in bacon and stuffed 
with the usu&lfarce made of one of their number, shall 
each be wrapped with extreme care, so that no part is 
uncovered, in a large sheet of white paper strewed with 
sliced truffles. Each packet being carefully tied up 
with packthread is buried in hot ashes, turning it if 
necessary till cooked. Our authority says that this 
way of cooking is very popular in Italy, but to his think- 
ing dries the birds too much and deprives them of their 
qualite restaurante. That, I should say, would depend 
on the stuffing and jacketting. But what sort of paper is 
it that will stand the heat of ashes hot enough to cook a 
partridge through ? Burnt-paper ash is not the nicest 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 277 



of condiments, and, moreover, the phrase 'sorte/-les 
du papier' at the end of the article implies that the 
wrapping is exhypothesi intact. Perhaps somebody who 
has a hearth and wood-ashes at his or her disposal 
will try the method. 

Turning to modern and straightforward cookery, I 
observe that some critics, while speaking very amiably of 
my efforts in alien art on the partridge, have been pleased 
to speak compassionately of my preference of plain roast 
bird as ' very English.' I hope that nothing worse will 
ever be said of any taste of mine; and that, as accord- 
ing to a famous axiom, 'it is permissible to Dorians to 
speak Doric,' so it may be permissible to Englishmen to 
eat English food. At any rate, though I have just given 
some and shall hope to give several other receipts for 
more elaborate dealing, I must repeat and emphasise 
the same preference here. A plainly and perfectly 
roasted grouse, with the accompaniments above re 
ferred to (or others, such as chipped or ribboned 
potatoes), is so good that he can in no other way be 
improved, though of course he may be varied. Some 
extreme grouse-eaters even declare that you ought to 
eat nothing at all but grouse at the same meal ; and 
though I cannot go with them there, I am thoroughly 
of the mind of a certain wise and gracious hostess who 
once said to me, ' I have given you very few things 



278 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

for dinner to-day ; for there is grouse, and I think 
grouse is a dinner.' Certainly it is rather wicked to 
eat a mere snippet of it at the end of a dinner of soup, 
fish, half a dozen entrees, and very likely a solid releve. 
The soup and the fish and one entree ought to be 
ample when grouse in sufficient quantity forms the 
roast. Also grouse forms a better ' solid ' than any- 
thing else that I know to finish a fish dinner with 
there is some subtle and peculiar appropriateness in 
its specially earthy and dry savour as a contrast to the 
fishinesses. For accompanying vegetables nothing can 
equal French beans, which Nature supplies at the right 
time exactly, and for drinking to match, nothing can 
even approach claret, good, but not too good. Not 
' forty thousand college councils ' shall ever persuade me 
but that it is something of a solecism and something 
of a sin to drink the very best Bordeaux with any solid 
food whatever. That should be drunk with a recueilk- 
ment which is impossible to the palate when it is 
simultaneously called to deal with the grosser act of 
eating. Let, therefore, the host, however fortunate 
and liberal, keep the First Three and also his best 
Leovilles and Rauzans, Moutons and Pichon Longuc- 
villes, for the time when the grouse has vanished : 
but let him accompany it while it is being discussed 
with anything up to Palmer or Lagrange, or even 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 279 



such second growths as Cos Destournel or Durfort. 
Not that Burgundy (again just short of the very best) 
goes ill with grouse, but that claret goes better. Alexis 
Soyer, who, though I have heard good judges declare 
him to have been a very overrated cook, said some 
excellent things, soon to be quoted, about grouse, re- 
commends a ' little sweet champagne ' with grouse. It 
was spoken like a Frenchman. 

The accompaniments of roast grouse, besides those 
already mentioned, are not very numerous. The liver 
of the birds cooked separately, pounded and spread 
upon the toast on which they are served, with 
butter, salt, and cayenne, is often recommended. 
Most people are unhappy without gravy ; for myself 
I think if the grouse is properly done, not too much 
and not too dry, it is better without any. The favourite, 
and to the general taste indispensable, bread crumbs 
are often horribly ill cooked, and unless very well 
cooked are the reverse of appetising. Soyer, as above 
reported by a good Scotch writer on cookery, who 
calls herself ' Jenny Wren,' liked to eat grouse, which 
he justly declared to vary inexplicably in flavour from 
year to year, ' absolutely by themselves with nothing 
but a crust of bread,' and this shows a purity of taste 
which makes one almost forgive him his sweet cham- 
pagne therewith. Watercress is as good with grouse 



2 So COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



as with most roasted birds, and salad almost as good 
as with any ; though perhaps the brown-fleshed birds 
do not so imperatively call for this adjunct as the 
white. I seem to have heard that there were times 
and places where grouse were eaten with melted 
butter ; but it is well known that there were times 
and seasons when there was hardly anything to which 
Britons did not add that unlovely trimming. It must 
be confessed that the thing is still done (the trimming 
being actually poured over the birds) in Scotland, 
where they certainly understand cooker} 7 , and where- 
they ought to understand that of grouse in particular. 
But it seems to me an abomination, and it must be 
remembered that if Scottish cookery, admirable as it 
is, has a tendency to sin, that tendency is in the 
direction of what is delicately called ' richness/ and 
that this may be an instance. No doubt the counter 
tendency of the grouse to the other original sin of 
dryness has also to be considered. 

There is a good deal more dispute as to the time, 
or in other words the degree, to which grouse ought to 
be roasted than in regard to most other gam,' birds. 
Nobody not, I should suppose, even an ogre or a 
cannibal likes underdone pheasant ; and I never heard 
of anybody who liked underdone partridge. On the 
other hand, only very unfortunately constituted persons 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 281 



(who should not eat wild- or water-fowl at all) like wild 
duck or widgeon, or anything of that kind, from solan 
geese to plovers, otherwise than distinctly underdone. 
But in regard to grouse it is impossible to say that 
there is a distinctly orthodox or a distinctly heterodox 
school in this respect. The ambiguity of general 
opinion is shown by the variation in time from twenty 
minutes to half an hour usually allotted for the roast- 
ing of an average-sized young bird (I have even 
seen three-quarters advised, but this is utterly pre- 
posterous). This amounts to the difference between 
a distinct redness close to the bone and 'cooking 
through.' There is even a school who would have 
grouse decidedly underdone. I think they are wrong, 
and that there should be nothing in the very least 
saignant about a grouse when he is carved, but that, 
if possible, he should be taken away from the fire the 
very minute that the last possibility of such a trace 
has disappeared. 

The other two simple ways of cooking grouse (I 
suppose men do boil them, just as they boiled Lord 
Soulis, but I never knew a case) are broiling and con- 
version into soup. A broiled or ' brandered ' grouse 
is quite admirable, but must of course be quite young, 
plentifully buttered (or oiled), and fairly peppered. 
When successfully done it is like all broiled birds, one 



282 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



of the very best things that it is possible to eat, and can 
be accompanied by an almost unlimited variety of sauces 
or gravies, from the plainest to the most elaborate. 
The same hyperbole may be used of grouse soup when 
it is what grouse soup should be. There are consider- 
able variations in the methods of preparing it; and, as in 
most cases, it is necessary to look to the end or object. 
Philosophically considered, the whole subject of soup 
may be divided into three parts. There is soup more 
or less clear, such as is probably at the present moment 
chiefly in favour as being most restorative in effect and 
most elegant in consumption. There is a puree of 
creamy texture, thick, but not containing any positive 
solids. And lastly there is the old-fashioned broth 
with solids in it, which is more an olla or stew than 
a soup strictly speaking, and which, though a little 
robust and massive for our modern dinners, is one of 
the most satisfactory varieties of food for reasonably 
hungry people. The first of these forms is that in 
which grouse soup is least commonly presented, and 
to which perhaps this bird lends itself least characteris- 
tically. It is, however, good in its way, and I never 
saw a better receipt for it than that which is given by 
Mrs. Henry Reeve. You take old, but quite fresh 
birds, which may be either grouse or black-game, or 
(I should add) ptarmigan. You add water at the rate 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 283 

of three pints to the brace of birds, and keep it sim- 
mering as slowly as possible for hours, adding pepper- 
corns and a little onion and carrot. Some time before 
serving you take the best pieces of the breast out 
(the birds of course have been cut up at first), press 
them and cut them up in little bits to add to the 
strained soup. 

Puree of grouse is much more in request and for 
those who can consume thick soups much better. 
The apparent variety of receipts for it is great; the 
real, smaller. All can be reduced, with little difficulty, 
to a common form. The birds are roasted, but not 
so long as if they were going to be simply eaten a 
quarter of an hour is generally held to be enough. All 
or most of the meat is then removed from the bones, 
which are put into a sufficient quantity of ready- 
made clear stock or consomme, with vegetables and 
seasonings to taste. This is allowed to simmer from 
one to three hours, the longer the better. Meanwhile, 
tlie meat which was taken off is pounded in a mortar 
and pressed through a sieve, some adding butter and 
grated biscuit or toasted bread, others ground rice, 
others nothing but seasoning. This paste is then 
stirred into the strained soup till it attains thr required 
thickness. Celery in moderation is an important in- 
gredient in puree of grouse, and some send k-mon 



284 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

with it to table ; but lemon is one of those good things 
which are liable to abuse in cookery, in regard to meats 
and fowls. It is more at home with fish and sweets. 

Of the ruder and more national form (which is 
also, I think, the best) of grouse soup, the celebrated 
stew whereof Meg Merrilies made Dominie Sampson 
partake was probably a variety, though the authority 
saith that moor-game were not the only ingredient of 
that soup or broth or stew. The beginning is the 
same as for puree, and indeed puree and this sort of 
soup melt into each other by imperceptible gradations. 
For you may either roast the birds as in the former 
case, cut off the best of the meat, break up and 
slightly pound the rest, fry it with butter, some ham 
and vegetables, and then stew it with good stock, in 
quantity sufficient (some say a quart to a bird), and 
after straining put the best pieces of meat in at the 
last moment, to warm up with a glass of claret. Or 
you may cut up the birds into joints to begin with, 
fry them in butter, and then add the stock, the vege- 
tables and the etceteras, proceeding in ordinary soup 
fashion till the thing is done. Some in this last stage 
advocate the adding of a young cabbage in pieces, 
with wine or not, as liked. And as the birds have, 
in this case, no ordinary cooking but the slight fry, 
and no pounding or other mollification, it is necessary 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 285 

to ' simmer till tender,' which in the case of an old 
grouse or black-cock may be a considerable time. 
For the really hungry man this is, no doubt, the best 
way of all ; but as a dinner dish it is perhaps, as has 
been hinted, too solid for the mere overture to which 
we have now reduced soup. In the days of the 
ancestors, they ate it late instead of early in the order 
of dishes ; and I am not certain that they were wrong. 
There are few things more engaging about grouse 
than the excellent appearance that it makes in cold 
cookery, whether by itself, in salads, or in pies. 
Chaudfroid of grouse (it is quite useless for purists to 
warn us that the word has nothing to do with chaud 
and nothing \\i\hfroid, that its being chaud is an acci- 
dent, and that its creator was one Chauffroix) is excel- 
lent. So are grouse potted whole (baked, with wine 
and butter, and afterwards stowed singly into pots with 
clarified butter poured over), or in joints, or in pounded 
paste. So is the cold roast bird in the severest 
simplicity, especially if he has not been cut into when 
hot. So is grouse salad, of which a savoury, but rather 
violent, if not even slightly vulgar, variety assigned to 
Soyer is to be found in all the books with more or 
fe\ver changes. The general principle is that, the joints 
of not too much roasted grouse being laid on a bed 
of salad and fenced round with garnishings of hard- 



286 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

boiled egg, gherkins, beetroot, c., a dressing of what 
the French would call an unusually corse kind is poured 
over and if possible slightly iced. In the most aggressive 
prescription I have seen for this, no less than two table- 
spoonfuls of chopped shallots and as much of tarragon 
and chervil figure. But anybody who can make a 
salad at all can, of course, adjust the dressing to his 
or her fancy, and the garnishing likewise. 

Grouse pie is of a higher order than these, although 
the odd changes of fashion have banished it from the 
chief meal of the day to breakfast, luncheon, and 
supper, at neither of which does anything better often 
appear. I do not know that anybody eats grouse pie 
hot, though I can conceive no particular or valid 
reason against it. It may be made, of course, in 
all the gradations of pies the homely old variety with 
edible crust, the 'raised pie,' whereof the crust is not 
intended to be eaten, though persons of unsophisticated 
habits and healthy appetite may be observed some- 
times to attempt the feat and the pie in which there 
is no pretence of crust at all, but which is concocted in 
a more or less ornamental case of fireproof china. (It 
was this last, perhaps, of which the poet of the Lakes, 
where there is much moor-game, wrote ' celestial with 
terrine ' though his foolish printers usually spell it 
'terrene.') And so the complexity of the materials 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 287 



and methods observes similar gradations, which by 
connection or accident very often adjust themselves 
to the three varieties of casing just mentioned. The 
simplest form of grouse pie merely requires the birds 
(jointed, halved, or sometimes whole), a proportion 
(a pound to a brace is usual) of rump steak cut into 
knobs, seasoning, crust, and a sufficiency of good gravy 
(which may or may not be touched up with lemon 
juice and claret) to fill up and moisten the mixture. 
To this, of course, the usual enrichments of hard eggs 
(whether of the domestic fowl or, as the youthful heir 
of Glenroy in Destiny suggests, plovers' eggs), mush- 
rooms, truffles, forcemeat balls, and so forth, may be 
added. These additions may further be said to be 
customary in the raised grouse pie, and invariable in 
that which is made in a tcrrine. These latter forms 
merge themselves very much in the general ' game 
pie,' an excellent thing in its way no doubt. But I 
do not know that it is so good as the simple grouse 
pie with nothing added but steak, seasoning, an 
alliaceous touch of some sort, and a few eggs and 
mushrooms. 

And so we come at last to the more elaborate 
varieties of cooking this noble animal. In that utter- 
ance of Soyer's above quoted he is made to confess 
that 'his art cannot improve grouse,' that in good 



288 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



years the flavour is such as to baffle more ornamental 
treatment, while in others there is nothing particular 
to be done with the fowl. Nevertheless, people will 
do things with it ; and some of the things they do 
must be told with the general caution, or at least 
opinion, that they are vanity. In the first place there 
is a way of pressing grouse which, since the initial 
process is to boil or stew the bird to rags, must be 
specially applicable, and should be chiefly or only 
applied, to the very oldest specimens. Having inflicted 
this fiery and watery torment on them you pull the 
meat off the bones, season it pretty freely, and clothe 
it with jelly (either with ordinary aspic or by fortifying 
the liquor in which it was boiled with gelatine), adding 
eggs, truffles, and anything else you please before 
letting it get solid in a mould or dish. It stands to 
reason that this is only a way though not at all a 
bad way of using birds not otherwise eatable. 

Salmis of grouse stands much higher indeed, it 
is probably the best of its kind, except that made of 
wild duck ; and inasmuch as there must always be 
remnants of roast birds, it is almost a necessary sup- 
plement to simpler cookery, besides being extremely 
good of itself. But it is necessary to remember several 
things about a salmis. The first is, that though the 
birds are always cooked first, it is indispensable that 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 289 



the sauce or gravy, or whatever you choose ' to call 
it, should have a thorough flavour of them, which 
is not to be attained by merely warming the pieces of 
game in it. This may be given, of course, in various 
ways, either by stewing the bones, skin, trimmings, 
and less worthy pieces of the grouse in the stock used, 
or by adding somefluree or ' essence of game ; ' but it 
must be attained somehow. The next thing to re- 
member is that this gravy or sauce when finished 
should never be a mere bath or slop. Madame Lebour- 
Fawssett says it should be ' of the consistency of well- 
made melted butter,' and I agree with her. Lastly, re- 
member that there must always be wine in a salmis; and 
that it is of great importance what wine it is. English 
books will recommend port or sherry, which, in my 
humble judgment, are extremely bad wines for all 
savoury cooking purposes. Pale dry sherry is, for 
that end, mostly quite useless, though I own that if 
I were rich I should try the experiment of boiling a 
ham in Manzanilla. The now despised, though in 
its way gorgeous, 'old brown' is apt to overpower 
every other flavour, and is too sweet, objections which 
apply still more strongly to port and even to Madeira, 
which is sometimes recommended, and which is cer- 
tainly preferable to either port or sherry. Besides, all 
these wines, and still more the brown 'cooking' 

u 



290 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 



brandy, which it is whispered is sometimes used, 
provoke undue thirst and general discomfort. A sound 
red Bordeaux with flavour and some body for brown 
meats, and a good (not an acid or wiry) Chablis or 
Pouilly for white, are probably the best things for 
the purpose. And I must again praise the French 
lady above cited for recommending equal parts of 
stock and wine as the main body of salmis sauce. 
The mixture is added to a foundation of well-warmed 
and browned butter and flour, plenty of seasoning, 
including herbs, some shallot rather than onion, 
and at the' last a little lemon juice, remembering the 
warnings above given. Nothing more but patience, 
careful watching, and still greater care when the game 
has been put in the mixture never to let it boil, 
is required to make a good salmis. But all this 
is required, and without it the thing cannot be a 
success. 

There is no perceptible difference between the 
better class of receipts for hashing grouse and those 
for a salmis of it. If there is any, it is that the hash 
gravy may be a little thinner ; but that is a matter of 
taste, and it is not uncommon to find cookery books 
in which the titles of the receipts for the two processes 
might be changed and little or no harm done. The 
fact is that ( salmis ' (a term of which even the great 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 291 



Littre did not know the origin, but which I venture 
to think a mere abbreviation of ' salmigondis ') is 
neither more nor less than a hash or ragout of game 
or wild birds, which has had its name extended with- 
out strict propriety to the tame duck, but no farther. 

Stewed grouse, which is, or was, common in Scot- 
land, is a sort of application of the process of hashing 
to birds not previously cooked, and presumably old. 
You cut them up, fry them with butter and shallot, or 
garlic, take out the latter and then simmer them gently 
for half an hour with equal but not large quantities 
of stock and wine. There should be a good deal of 
pepper. 

Grouse can of course be made into quenelles, kro- 
meskis, croquettes, salpicons, bouchces, and all the other 
varieties of rissoles in which pounded or minced meat 
is conveyed into fanciful and easily consumed shapes 
of small size. They might be made into 3. pain or 
quenelle on a great scale ; they can be scuffled . and 
are very good so. It is further obvious and easy to 
stuff them in roasting or accompany them in pieces 
with all kinds of forcemeat, from the simplest to the 
most complicated, from the plain liver-and-bread- 
crumb to compounds a la financicre and a la Lucitllns, 
in which truffles and cockscombs and the like figure. 
Grouse cutlets the birds being usually halved, partly 



292 COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 

boned, fried, and then simmered in espagnole or some 
similar sauce are well enough, and can be sophisti- 
cated before being served up by having truffles and 
other associations stuck on them. It is also some- 
times recommended that they should be prepared in 
this way before being made into a pie. 

Most of the books contain a receipt usually stated 
(conscientiously) to be German, for marinading grouse, 
which might be useful either in the case of birds 
accidentally kept too long or in that of very aged ones, 
or, as observed above, to tame the wildness of the 
rougher members of the tribe. Otherwise I cannot 
conceive it to be necessary to treat good red grouse 
in this way, however useful something of the same 
kind may be to make pork taste like wild boar, rabbit 
like hare, and very dry roe-venison like the flesh of a 
hart of grease. You take (the particulars never vary) 
a quarter of a pint of vinegar, a score of juniper berries, 
some peppercorns, and two or three bay leaves. You 
steep the birds in this for three days, frequently 
turning them and spooning the marinade over them. 
You then stuff them with turkey stuffing, lard the 
breasts, roast and serve. 

But after this and the other things the mind returns 
from these excesses to the elegance of a good roast 
grouse simple of himself, with some such a feeling as 



COOKERY OF THE GROUSE 293 



that which ' Neville Temple and Edward Trevor ' 
attributed long ago to Tannhauser when 

a dewy sense 
Of innocent worship stole 

over his heated brain and sense as he contemplated 
the Princess after his return from the Venusberg. It 
is true that the ingenious wickedness of some may 
draw a bad moral in favour of variety even from this 
comparison ; but on their heads be it.
