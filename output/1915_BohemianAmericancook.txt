A FEW WORDS BY THE TRANSLATOR. 

J HAVE translated the cook book compiled by my 
mother for two reasons: First, becanse we 
continnally receive inquiries for a Bohemian 
cook book written in the English langaiage, from 
the daughters of our Bohemian immigrants, who were 
born and raised here and do not read Bohemian as well 
as their parents. Second, to serve those American 
housewives who wish to try foreign dishes. 

The Bohemian fathers and mothers deplore the fact 
that their children have Americanized so quickly, that 
in the second generation their mother tongue is half 
obliterated. We can see their side of it, those im- 
migrants who left their fertile and beautiful land be- 
cause long years of despotism, class prejudice, heavy 
taxation and other unjust vexations have made it well- 
nigh impossible for a poor peasant or laborer to better 
himself there. The average American can have no con- 
ception of what it means to tear one's self up by the 
very roots, leave one's native land and dearest re- 
latives forever, start life anew in a strange country, 
and learn a new language. 

On the other hand, we can see clearly the childrens' 
side of the situation. They have been born, raised and 
educated in America, and this country will always be 
their home. Their parents' land is to them but a 
picture or a story. Among our people in the country 
settlements the children talk and even read and write 
Bohemian to a greater extent than in the cities, but 
in any event it is safe to say that with the third s'enera- 
tion the large majority cease to be Bohemians, except 
in name. 

Each country has its special style of cookery, and I 
think that is one way of preserving the nationality to 
a certain extent and for a time at least, for we all like 
those dishes which our mothers prepared for us. If 
the daughters cook like the mothers did, and teach 



4 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

their daughters to do likewise, it will at least be a re- 
minder of our parents' native land. 

As far as the demand of American housewives for 
foreign cookery books is concerned, that is no doubt 
brought about by the ever increasing custom of travel- 
ing abroad, which of course makes cosmopolitans of 
us. The average American, who travels only in his 
own country and does not live near settlements of 
industrious and progressive foreigners, generally has 
about three names for all Europeans, namely: Dago, 
Dutchman or Swede. Of the Slavs he usually knows 
nothing at all. It is different with the American who 
has been abroad. If he is at all intellectual and observ- 
ing, he knows that there is culture and crudeness in 
all nationalities, and that aside from certain racial 
characteristics, we are all the same human beings, 
with the same struggles, sorrows, hopes, aspirations 
and problems. Perhaps the present war has done more 
to open the minds of Americans to the status of the 
various nationalities composing Europe, and the 
relation they bear to each other, than anything else. 
And when it comes down to cooking itself, the real 
cook, no matter what her nationality, is always eager 
to try something new. I know that the American 
housewife will find many new and tasty dishes in this 
book. 

My mother, Mary Rosický, was born in Klatovy, 
Bohemia, December 8th, 1854, and died in Omaha, 
Nebraska, October 9th, 1912, having come to this coun- 
try when thirteen years of age. The women in her 
family were noted for their fine cooking, so that 
she acquired her art through a natural inheritance. 
However, while good cooking is in the main an inborn 
art, it can be learned by perseverance, patience and 
diligence.

PREFACE. 

^^YC> BOOK is valuable, if the reader does not read 
J\j it carefully and does not grasp the spirit in 
Á\ which it is written. When following directions 
given in a cook book, it is necessary that every- 
thing be done exactly a^ the recipe states, even though 
some thing may seem insignificant, for very often suc- 
cess depends upon that very insignificant thing. 

American cookery is, in many respects, more simple 
than Bohemian cookery, for in America many appliances 
and improvements are used which are not known in 
Bohemia. Besides those, baking powder is used ex- 
tensively, often instead of yeast, and that is entirely un- 
known in Bohemia. Among Bohemians who came here 
from their mother country, there are many who think 
that American cookery is not as good as Bohemian. 
This is probably owing to the fact that many American 
housewives like to prepare only those dishes that 
require the least time and labor, but even Bohemian 
foods may be poor, if proper care is not given to their 
preparation. That American cookery does not always 
appeal to those who have grown up in any European 
country is easily understood, for we usually like best 
those foods to which we have been accustomed from 
childhood. We give in this cook book also some Ame- 
rican dishes and think the readers will find that they 
are as good as any, when properly made. 

It will not be amiss to give a few hints in general, 
regarding the kitchen: 

Iron kettles, etc. which were used a great deal for- 
merly and still are used to a certain extent, when new 
should be filled with water, to which has been added 
some charcoal, and this should be kept boiling for a while. 
Then we may scour the kettle well and it is ready for 
use. Iron skillets, griddles, etc. should be well greased 



6 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

and then the grease should be burned or smoked off^ 
once or twice, before they are used. Where conditions 
permit, nothing but granite and ahiminum ware should 
be used. 

If we wish to use stone or earthen ware, it is best 
to fill new pieces with cold water and let it come slow- 
ly to the boiling point. In this way we may ward off 
the cracking thereof. 

When washing greasy kitchenware, put a little soda 
into the water. 

Vinegar cruets, water bottles and bottles in general 
may be cleansed with water and small shot, tacks or 
sand. 

Put two or three 03'ster shells, thoroughly cleansed, 
into your water kettle and the sediment from the water 
will settle on them, instead of on the inside of the 
kettle.. 

It goes without saying that the kitchen should be 
as thoroughly equipped as possible. 

Below is a table of measures and weights, whiclj 
may come in handy to the housewife: 

Sixteen ounces are one pound. 

Four quarts or eight pints are one gallon. 

Four pecks are one busliel, and a peck is two gal 
Ions or eight quarts. 

Four cups are one quart. 

An ordinary tumbler is half a pint. 

Two heaping teaspoons contain as much as one 
heaping tablespoon. 

One heaping tablespoon of sugar weighs one ounce. 

Two level teacups of granulated sugar weigh one 
pound. 

Two heaping tablespoons of flour weigh one ounce. 

One teacup contains five heaping tablespoons of 
flour. 

Five teacups. of sifted flour weigh one pound. 



BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 7 

A quart of sifted flour weighs one pound. 

A liberal tablespoon of butter weighs one ounce. 

A piece of butter, the size of an egg, weighs two 
ounces. 

A teacup full of soft butter contains four table- 
spoons. 

Two teacups of butter, well packed, weigh one 
pound. 

Eight large or ten medium sized eggs weigh one 
pound. 

In conclusion it may be noted that inasmuch as 
a great many of the recipes in this book call for 
various condiments (mace, cloves, allspice, garlic, cara- 
way seed, lemon rind, anchovies etc.) it is impossible 
to give the exact amount, because individual tastes 
vary. The housewife must use her own judgment, 
and if necessary omit some of them altogether. The 
expert foreign cook depends entirely on her tongue in 
this respect, adding a little of this, tasting the food, 
then adding a little of something else and so on. Some 
people do not like garlic or caraway seed. These may 
be omitted altogether, without spoiling the dish, and 
that is true of many of the others. However, those 
who do like the various flavors, like to have food 
seasoned that way. 

In the recipes for bread, raised tarts, etc., the exact 
amount of flour is seldom given. As every cook knows, 
flours vary, and she must be guided by her experience. 
After one or two failures she can tell just how much 
flour to use. 

Many recipes call for flour and butter blended 
together, without giving the exact amounts of each. 
In this too the housewife must be guided by the taste 
of her family. She can use from one tablespoon of 
butter to two of flour to half of each (a tablespoon 
of butter to a tablespoon of flour). 

Wherever the word "pepper'^ is used, black or 



8 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK 

white pepper is meant. In recipes calling for red pep- 
per or paprika, it is so stated. A pinch or dash of 
spices means of course ground spices. 

In recipes calling for wine, sour wine is used for 
meats, gravies, and sauces requiring sweetening, in 
all others use sweet wine. 



Soup. — Polévka. 

The amount of water used is governed by the 
amount of meat. A pound of meat requires a quart of 
water. 

If you wish to have good soup, place the meat in 
cold water, and let it simmer gently. If you do not 
care for very strong soup and wish the meat to have a 
better flavor, you may place it in boiling water. 

Some cooks prefer to skim soup, but this is not ne- 
cessary, in fact, it will be stronger if the scum be left 
in it and the soup be strained before putting in the rice, 
noodles or whatever you are going to use. 

Two quarts of soup is considered enough for six 
or eight people and the average recipe is figured out 
accordingly. 

Soups are divided into two kinds: meat soups and 
Lenteii soups. Both kinds may be clear or thick. Clear, 
thin soups are usually served with croutons, etc. 

Meat Soups. — Masité polévky. 

I. ORDINARY BEEF SOUP. 

Ohi/čejná čistá hovězí polévka. 
Wash two pounds of beef in clear cold water (this 
will do for six people) and pound lightly with a wooden 
pounder for the purpose. Place the meat in two quarts of 
cold water and let it simmer. When the soup ceases 
foaming, add salt and various vegetables, usually the 
more the better, as: celery tops and roots, parsley tops 



SOUPS. 9 

and roots, onion, leek, kale, carrots, tomatoes, cabba^i>-e, 
cauliflower, etc. Needless to remark that all the ye^e- 
tables should first be carefully washed. If vegetables 
are scarce, as for instance in winter, a handful of dry 
peas, a small piece of garlic, a dash of caraway seed, a 
few dried mushrooms, onions and two tablespoons 
of canned tomatoes will add a good flavor. The cook 
may use such vegetables as the family likes and must 
govern herself thereby. A good flavor is added to soup 
if we add minced onion and beef liver fried in butter. 
Beef kidneys and bones also add flavor. After putting in 
the vegetables, let the soup simmer very gently two and 
a half to three hours. If the soup evaporates to any 
extent, add boiling water, to keep up the required 
amount, a little at the time. When the soup is finally 
done, strain through a sieve into another kettle, bring 
to the boiling point and add whatever you wish, accord- 
ing to the recipes that follow. 

2. BOUILLON. 

Bouillon. 

Bouillon is prepared in the same manner as the 
foregoing, with the exception that the meat is cut into 
cubes, which makes the soup stronger. Bouillon is 
served in cups. 

3. SAGO SOUP. 

PoUvl'a se sag em. 

Wash the sago several times in warm and finally 
in hot water, tlien let it boil in clear beef soup a few 
minutes. Before serving, add salt and a dash of grated 
mace. One tablespoonful of sago is required to a 
person. 

4. SAGO SOUP WITH YOLKS. 

Ságová polcvl'a se žloutl- ij. 

Wash the sago as in the foregoing and place in a 
kettle of I'lear soup. When the sago is soft, add four 
yolks beaten in a small quantity of warm soup, and 



10 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

take away from the fire immediately. If the yolks were 
to boil, they would curdle. 

5. BARLEY SOUP. 

Ohijčejná l-rupová 'poUvka. 

Wash thoroughly half a cup of pearl barley, pour 
over it a cup of liot water, add a tablespoon of butter

cup of boiling water over it, add salt, ground mace, 
a little piece of good butter and let it boil until 
tender. If the water evaporates, add boiling water. 
The rice must not burn or be broken. When the rice 
is done, turn it into the tureen, add minced parsley, a 
pinch of saffron and the clear soup. You may finally 
add one egg beaten with a cup of sweet cream. 

7. RICE SOUP WITH SPRING CHICKEN. 

Rýžová polévka s hiiřaty. 

Pick over a cup of rice and wash thoroughly. Place 
it in a saucepan and pour over it two or three cups of 
boiling water, add a piece of good butter, salt, and boil 
the rice until it is tender. Make soup of two spring 
chickens. When done, take them out and cut up in 
small pieces and place in the tureen. Strain the soup, 
skim off all the fat, add a little gTated nutmeg and 
minced parsley and pour all over the rice and then pour 
this mixture over the chickens in the tureen.

add to the soup-meat half an old chicken). Put this 
to boil and mix constantly until the soup begins to 
boil. Then add salt, a small piece of good butter and 
allow it to boil one hour, adding clear soup as it 
evaporates. Then strain through a fine strainer and 
place again over the fire. When it begins to boil, pour 
into a tureen, add tAVO yolks beaten with three table-

Clean six large mushrooms thoroughly, slice thin, 
add minced parsley, and allow all to stew in two table- 
spoons of butter, then dust with flour and stew a little 
while longer. Then pour on enough good clear soup to

pinch of mace and several tablespoons of good cream, 
allow it to boil and pour over bread croutons. 

11. CAULIFLOWER SOUP. 

PoUvl'a z harfiolu. 
Wash a nice head of cauliflower, separate into 
pieces of the same size and let them boil in soup until 
tender. Place a tablespoon of good butter in a sauce-

Place on the molding board two cups of flour, make 
a well in the center and break into it two eggs. Add

and eggs together until you can handle the dough with 
your liands. Then work thoroughly with your hands 
until the dough is smooth and soft as velvet, but it must 
not be too stiff with flour. Cut this dough into three 
pieces and after thoroughly dusting your board with 
flour, roll out each piece as thin as you can. Allow 
these to dry, then cut into strips a little over an inch

wide, place one on top of anotlier in a pile about two 
inches high. With a sharp knife cut fine noodles, 
spread them out over the board and allow them to dry 
thoroughly. You may also make little squares. For 
these the dough need not be rolled as thin as for the 
noodles. When it is partially dry, fold it over and cut 
into pieces about a quarter of an inch square. 

15. CHICKEN SOUP WITH NOODLES. 

Polévka se slepici a nudlemi.

to a paste with salt, a pinch of mace and pepper, two 
eggs, salt and enough bread crumbs to make the mix- 
ture not stiff or thin. Always remember that the 
bread crumbs swell in boiling, so that if 3"ou put in too 
much, the quenelles will be hard. This is true also of 
farina. Form balls of this and boil ten minutes in two

Beef. — Hovězí maso. 

96. BOILED BEEF. 

Vařené hovězí maso. 

As every cook knows, the meat from different parts 
of the animal varies. The rump is best to use for boiled 
beef, but is must not be too fat. The brisket and flank 
do not have a good flavor and are suitable only for 
soup. As has already been stated, boiled beef tastes 
best when placed in boiling water, whereas if your aim 
is to get good soup only, the meat is placed in cold wa- 
ter. Beef, and in fact all meat, is more tender if not 
freshly killed. The meat sold by the packing houses is 
generally from three to six months old, it being kept in 
cold storage that long, before being put on the market. 
Such meat is very tender. ^ The cook must use a little 
judgment in boiling beef. If the meat is from a young 
animal, a two pound piece may be boiled an hour and a 
half. If from an old animal, it will take longer. The 
meat must be boiled so long until it is easily pierced 
with a fork. If boiled too long, it crumbles and loses fla- 
vor. When putting the meat to boil, cover well and 
when it has come to a boil, let it simmer gently. If 
boiled rapidly, it will be tough. Boiled beef is cut into 
small pieces and usually served with a sauce.

and as porterhouse steak is used in this country so 
much, the butcher rarely has any beef tenderloin on 
hand. However, if you wish to prepare this dish and 
can obtain the proper cut, trim it, interlard thickly with 
bacon, salt and place in a crock. Place in a saucepan one 
sliced onion, half of a whole ginger, several whole pep- 
pers and allspice, a pinch of thyme, one bay leaf, two

Hovězí jJečeně po aniericku. 
Roast beef is best wlien a large piece of meat is 
used, six pounds or more. However, four pounds is 
usualh^ plenty for a small family. Dust the roast with 
salt and pepper, place in a deep pan, rub a tablespoon of 
butter over the top, pour a cup of hot water under 
it and roast in a hot oven. The oven should be very 
hot at first, so as to sear the meat, later it should be 
slower, so that the meat will be tender. After it has 
been roasting half an hour, sprinkle sliced onion over 
it and turn. When the meat is done, make a gra- 
vy of the fat. If very fat, pour off some and add a 
cup of hot water. Mix flour and water until smooth 
and thicken the gravy with it. The meat should roast 
fifteen minutes for every pound, so that a four pound 
roast requires one hour, etc.

BEEFSTEAK. 

Beefsteak is an English and American dish. A 
great many Bohemians never learn to like it and they 
cannot understand its popularity among Americans. 



BEEF. 41 

This is partly because it requires so little preparation, 
while Bohemian recipes call for a much longer and more 
thorough cooking of meats. Then, too, beefsteak is so 
often taken from poor cuts and is therefore tough and 
unpalatable. The real beefsteak is the porterhouse. The 
next best is sirloin and the next chuck steak, but neither 
of these has the flavor, juiciness and tenderness of the 
porterhouse. 

110. FRIED STEAK. 

Beefsteak smažený. 
If you wish to fry a porterhouse steak, it will not 
require much pounding, but the sirloin or chuck steaks 
need to be pounded well. Never wash a steak; if ne- 
cessary, wipe it with a cloth. For a two pound steak 
place in a skillet two tablespoons of butter, or the fat 
trimmed from the steak, but never lard. When the but- 
ter or fat is smoking hot, place the steak in the skillet, 
salt and pepper the top, allow the underside to brown 
quickly, to keep in the juice, then turn, salt and pepper 
the other side, allow the underside to brown and then, 
if you like the steak well done, it need not fry as quickly 
as at the beginning. When the steak is done, add to 
the fat a little minced onion and when it has browned, 
add a little hot water and pour this gravy over the 
steak. If you wish, you may thicken it with a little 
flour. 

111. BROILED STEAK. 

Beefsteak na rosti. 
Broiled steak is always rare and the true beefsteak 
lover prefers it this way, because it is the juiciest. For 
broiling, thicker slices of steak are used than for fry- 
ing. Pound the meat as for frying, place on a broiler 
and broil over a clear fire, turning over when one side 
is done. When done, place on a hot platter, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, dot bits of butter over it and 
serve. 



42 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

If you do not have a regular broiler, you may ''pan 
broil" the steak, although this does not give it the real 
broiled flavor. Allow the pan or skillet to become 
smoking hot, then rub over it a piece of fat trimmed 
from the steak, place the steak thereon, broil on both 
sides and before serving add salt, pepper and bits of 
butter. 

112. BAKED STEAK. 

Beefsteak pečený. 
Place the steak in a baking pan, having sprinkled 
salt and i^epper over it. If it is not very fat, put a 
piece of butter on top and cover with grated bread 
crumbs. Pour a little hot water under it and bake about 
twent}^ minutes; longer, if you like it well done. 

113. STEWED STEAK. 

Beefsteak dušený. 
Cut up two pounds of steak into small pieces, place 
in a saucepan with salt and pepper, add one or two 
sliced onions and hot water. Cover and simmer gently 
until the meat is tender. Cream two tablespoons of but- 
ter with two tablespoons of flour, add to the stew, mix- 
ing until smooth. 

114. STEAK WITH SOUR GRAVY. , 

Beefsteak na kyselo. 
For this purpose round steak may be used. Trim 
well and pound. Place a tablespoon of lard in a 
skillet and when it is smoking hot, brown the steak 
in it on both sides over a hot fire, then cover the 
meat with boiling water, add salt and a large onion 
sliced. Cover and simmer over a slow fire. If the 
liquor evaporates, add as much boiling water as you 
wish to have sauce. There should be a cup of liquor 
to a pound and a half of meat. To this liquor add a 
cup of good sour cream thickened with a little flour. 
Stir constantly while pouring this in, so the gravy be 
smooth. Then add a tablespoon of catsup and more

into small pieces, place in the hot gravy and serve. 

115. HAMBURGER STEAK. 

Ilamhurskfj steak. 
Grind in a meat grinder or chop fine two pounds 
of good beef. The markets in the cities have on hand 
ground meat, but it is hardly ever prepared from really 
nice meat and it is much better to buy a good piece 
and do this yourself. You may add a little of the suet 
and one onion. Salt and pepper and work thorou^'hly 
with your hands, make small cakes, cover with flour 
and fry in hot lard and butter, half of each. 

116. GOULASH.

mon, a bay leaf, two tablespoons of vinegar, one table- 
spoon of sugar and allow it to stew. When the meat is 
tender, dust with a tablespoon of flour and if quite dry, 
add a little hot water, two or three tablespoons of cat- 
sup and a pinch of paprika. iVllow this to stew a while 
longer, then serve. 

117. HUNGARIAN GOULASH. 

UJierslcjj guláš. 
Cut beef, mutton and pork into small squares. Fry

and later the pork, dust with flour, add beef soup or 
hot water, salt, paprika, several whole allspice and, if 
you wish, a little wine. Stew until the meat is tender. 
You may stew potatoes with the meat. Two or three 
pounds of meat is sufficient for six i3eople.

weight on top, so it stays under water. In the morning 
wash well in two waters. Make a batter of water and 
flour, cover the ham all over, pressing down well, 
and bake three or four hours in a slow oven, according 
to the size. When done, take off the covering and allow 
the meat to cool. Trim off the lean meat, put through 
a meat grinder and grind fine. Add paprika or pepper 
to taste, allspice and salt if necessary. Mix together 
well, pack in Mason or other preserving jars and put 
away in a cool place. The fat, trimmed from the ham

Zapečené vepřové maso. 
When the meat has thoroughly cooled after killing, 
it is cut into pieces about half an inch thick, all fat and 
bones are trimmed off, the meat is salted and allowed 
to stand thus one hour. Then place the meat in a bak- 
ing pan, scatter a little caraway seed over it and bake, 
without adding any water to it. When all the meat is 
baked and cooled, pack it in stone jars or crocks, as 
solidly as possible and pour melted lard over it, leaving 
a layer of lard two inches thick on top. When using 
this meat, cover the remainder carefully with lard, so it 
will not spoil. 

171. ROAST PORK TONGUE. 

Pečené vepřové jazyl-y.

a crock and pour over them hot vinegar, which you 
have boiled with an onion and the various spices, as all- 
spice, whole pepper, cloves, whole mace, etc. Allow the 
contents to stand in this two days before using. Pigs'^ 
feet require four to five hours boiling. 

174. STUFFED CABBAGE No. 1. 

Ptáčci hez hosii. 
Prepare a nice head of cabbage, leaving it whole, 
place it in a deep kettle and cover with boiling water. 
Put it on the back of the stove, cover and let it stand 
thus, until it becomes tender. It must not boil. When 
it can be pierced with a fork, take it out to cool. In the 
meantime wash a cup or two of rice, pour boiling 
water on it, add salt, a piece of butter, or if you have 
soup, use it instead of the water, in which case you do 
not have to use butter. Cover and let it stew in tlie 
oven, until about half done. Do not use too much wa- 
ter or soup, so the rice will not become sticky; it should 
be rather dry. When the rice is half done, take it out 
and cool. Mince fine or put through tlie meat grinder 
a nice piece of lean pork and also a piece of veal or 
young beef, although pork alone may be used. The pro- 



60 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

portion of meat and rice varies, according to taste. 
Equal amounts of each are good, or if you do not like 
it rich, use more rice than pork, or you can use more 
pork that rice. Mix both together, add salt and pepper, 
two, three or four beaten eggs, according to the amount, 
four, five or six tablespoons of cream and a finely 
minced onion fried in butter. It should be quite moist, 
as the baking will dry it out. If too stiff, add more 
cream or milk. Take the head of cabbage apart, being 
careful to keep the leaves whole. Line a casserole with 
cabbage leaves. Put a tablespoon of the mixture on a 
leaf, fold the ends over each other, so as to enclose the 
contents. If you wish, you can fasten the ends with 
toothpicks. Arrange these in layers and when you have 
the dish full, half fill it with hot water or soup and 
cover with cabbage leaves and sliced tomatoes, then 
cover the dish and bake from three quarters to one 
hour. When done, serve with sauce, either tomato 
sauce or one made of sour cream, butter and the yolk 
of an egg. 

175. STUFFED CABBAGE No. 2. 

Ptáčci hez kostí na jiný způsob. 

In two tablespoons of lard fry one large minced 
onion until yellow, then add to it two pounds of lean 
pork cut into small pieces. Add a pinch of paprika and 
salt, cover and stew over a slow fire. Do not use any 
water. When the meat is half done, cool and mince 
fine, add a cup of raw rice, the liquor from the meat 
and mix together. Then proceed as in the foregoing 
recipe. 

176. LIVER SAUSAGE. 
Jaternice. 

Boil a pig's .head. If too large and fat, trim off 
the fat. Boil the lungs, heart and kidneys in a separate 
kettle. Use only half of the liver and chop that raw. 
When all is done, mince fine. To one part of meat use two 
parts of stale white bread soaked in water and then 



PORK. 61 

squeezed dry. Mix together, add pepper, salt, ground 
allspice, a pinch of ground cloves, grated lemon rind, 
marjoram and a few cloves of garlic, (mashed to a 
paste). Have ready thoroughly cleaned beef casings, 
cut into pieces about six inches long, and also string or 
toothpicks, to fasten the ends. When the mixture is pre- 
pared, fill one casing, tie or fasten each end and place 
the sausage in boiling water, in order to test it. If it 
needs any more spices, salt, etc. add what is needed and 
proceed to fill the casings. Some people boil these 
sausages in large quantities at one time, but in this way 
they are more likely to break. It it better to have two 
moderately sized kettles, filled with the liquor in which 
you have boiled the meat. Put in each just a few 
sausages at a time, so the kettle is about half filled. 
When they rise to the top, take them out, put them in a 
dish containing clear cold water for a moment or two 
and then lay them on a clean board. The liquor in which 
you boil them if used for soup should be cooled and 
skimmed, so it will not be greasy. 

177. BLOOD SAUSAGE. 

Jelita. 

When killing pork, catch the blood and beat it, so 
it will not clot. Take a piece of pork from the neck and 
a piece of leaf lard, boil both until partly done, then cut 
both up into fine dice. Divide this into two parts. To 
one part add stale white bread soaked in • milk and 
squeezed dry, half of the blood, salt, grated lemon rind, 
pepper, ground allspice, ginger, cloves, minced onion 
fried in lard and enough melted lard to make it rather 
moist. Mix well, fill thoroughly cleaned casings, fasten 
the ends and boil. Add barley that has been boiled in 
water to the other half, the rest of the blood, salt, pep- 
per and spices as above, put in casings and boil. 



62 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

178. BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. 

Uzenice. 
Take two parts of beef and one part of pork, minee 
fine, add salt and pepper, mix well and with this till 
thoronghly cleaned casings. Put them to smoke the 
next day and smoke two days. Before using, bake half 
an hour, in a little water. 

179. WINE SAUSAGES. 

Klobásy. 
Mince fine a piece of pork from the neck. Use one 
part of white bread soaked in cream to three parts of 
meat. Add pepper, mace, grated lemon rind, salt, 
a little white wine, work together about ten minutes 
and put into thoroughly cleaned mutton casings. Or 
you may use two parts of pork, one part of veal, minced 
fine, moistened with cream and spiced with salt, pep- 
per, etc. as above. For wine sausage, the casings may 
be left quite long and should be rolled up in a spiral. 
They will not keep, especially in' warm weather, so must 
be used right away. Before serving, fry in a skillet, as 
you would breakfast sausage, adding a little wine to 
the water. 

180. HEAD CHEESE. 

Masovfj sýr. 
Boil pork from the leg, the head (trim off the fat 
around the chin), the ears, snout and tongue (you may 
use a beef tongue also). When done, trim out the bones, 
cartilages etc., skin the tongue, cut all into small pieces. 
Have ready a round form, such as a bucket. In the 
bottom place a layer of meat from 111 o leg, dust with salt, 
pepper, mace, then put in a layer of the ears and snout, 
dust with salt, etc., then a layer of the tongue and con- 
tinue until the dish is full. Cover, place a weight on 
top, and let stand thus over night in a cool place. Tlie 
next day take this cheese out, slice and serve with 
mustard, oil and vinegar, or sliced lemon. This must 



VEAL. 63 

all be packed wliile warm, otherwise it will not stick to- 
gether. When taking the cheese out, run a sharp knife 
around, so it will fall out whole. You may use ground 
cloves or sage instead of mace. If you wish, you may line 
the form with thoroughly cleaned and boiled pork skins. 

181. PRESSED BLOOD SAUSAGE. 

Baclior, 
Boil the head, snout, ears, tongue, and a piece of 
meat from the neck. When done, cool and cut into dice, 
add rendered lard and the cracklings, fresh blood, 
salt, pepper, ginger, allspice, minced onion fried in lard 
and mix well. Fill a thoroughly cleaned pork stomach 
with this and boil half an hour in the same liquor. 
When you pierce it with a toothpick and no blood runs 
out, it is done. Place it in a press wliile warm, or put 
a heavy weight on it. If you add a nice beef tongue to 
this, it will be extra good. It is served sliced fine, with 
vinegar and. pepper or vinegar and onion.

add two eggs, salt, one onion minced fine, half a

and pepper the meat all over, place in the pan with 
the ribs on top, dot bits of butter over it, add a little 
hot water and roast, basting frequently. It is well to 
dust all roast veal with grated bread crumbs, adding 
them after it has been roasting about an hour, as veal 
gets too dry in the oven and the bread crumbs pre- 
vent this. 

188. ROAST FILLET OF VEAL. 

Ledvinková 'pečené. 

Wash three or four pounds of veal from the loin with 
the kidney, dust with salt and pepper, place in a pan, 
dot with bits of butter, add a little hot water and roast 
in the oven. When browned on one side, turn. While 
the meat is roasting, iiib butter over the to]3 four or 
five times. About half an hour before it is done, sprinkle 
bread crumbs over the top. If the liquor evaporates, 
add hot water, and baste frequently, so the bread 
crumbs will adhere to the meat.

FISH. Ill 

Fish. — Ryby. 

In Boliemia fish are usually bought alive, to avoid 
the danger of getting a fish that died before it was 
caught. In this country it is usually the other way, but 
if we deal with a reliable firm, we can be reasonably 
sure that the fish is in good condition. Fish caught for 
the market are usually caught on a large scale, and 
those who are engaged in this industry want to keep a 
good reputation. Fresh fish have clear bulging eyes, 
flexible jaws, red fins and shiny scales. 

Cleaned fish may be kept for several days in win- 
ter by salting it and letting it freeze. 

Fish is killed by striking in the head and tail with 
a wooden mallet, then cutting across the upper part of 
the body, under the fins. The belly is cut lengthwise and 
the entrails- are carefully taken out, being careful that 
the gall bladder is not torn. It is then washed in cold 
water, scaled and cut into pieces or not, according to 
whether it is to be baked or fried. To scale a fish, 
place it on a board, take hold of the tail, and with a 
dull knife, held horizontally, scrape off the scales, 
working toward the head. This is best done outside, 
as the as the scales fly in all directions. Then wash 
the fish and dry with a cloth. 

Fish having a taste of earth or mud may be soaked 
in salted water before preparing. 

Always cook the fish on the day when you bought it. 

If you want to have the fish a blue color, you must 
wet the board on which you clean it, so that the fish 
does not lose any of its sliminess. This is what pro- 
duces the blue color. Never allow fish to soak in wa- 
ter long, it spoils the flavor. Fish are good only in 
season. For frying use more lard and just a small pro- 
portion of butter. 

Salted dried fish should be soaked, the part covered 
with skin being on top.

Eggs. — Vejce. 

421. BOILED EGGS. 

Vejce vařená.

and the white not too hard. This may be attained by 
placing fresh eggs in boiling water and immediately 
withdrawing the dish to the back of the stove, allow- 
ing them to stand thus in hot water (not boiling) five 
minutes. These are especially digestible for sick people. 
Another way is to place the eggs in cold water and let 
them come to the boiling point. As soon as the water 
begins to boil, count twelve very slowly. And still an- 
other way is to place them in boiling water and let them 
boil three minutes. When boiled five minutes, they 
will be half hard, and when boiled eight or ten minutes, 
they will be hard. 

422. FRIED EGGS. 

Vejce smažená. 
Melt three tablespoons of lard and one of butter in 
a smooth skillet. When hot, break into the fat one egg 
at the time, being careful not to break the yolk. When 
there is any question about the eggs being fresh, it is 
best to break them first into a saucer and examine each. 
When the eggs begin to fry, throw the hot fat over 
them with a tablespoon, which fries them on top and 
makes them look nicer than if turned. Fried eggs are 
usually served with fried ham or bacon and make an 
ideal breakfast dish.

dough is smooth, then let it stand half an hour. In 
the meantime fry in butter two slices of bread cut 
into dice, cool and add to the dough. Make dumplings 
the size of a small apple, dust your hands with flour 
and roll each into a round ball. Place in boiling salt- 
ed water and boil 10 minutes. , Then you place the 
dumplings in the water, they usually fall to the bottom 
and would stick, unless you pry them loose with a 
knife. Then cover tightly and do not uncover for five 
minutes. They must boil constantly but not too rapidly. 
This applies to the manner of boiling dumplings in 
general although the time may vary. Dumplings serv- 
ed with meat should be torn apart with two forks, 
(cutting with a knife impairs the lightness), and 
sprinkled with fried minced onion or fried bread 
crumbs and melted butter. Dumplings are usually done 
in ten minutes, sometimes longer, as shown in the

Puff Paste and Pies. — Máselné těsto a páje. 

668. PUFF PASTE No. 1. 

Máselné těsto. 
This is very difficult to make according to a 
printed description, and the best success is attained 
when one can watch an experienced cook work. The 
illustration shown Iierc will give some idea of the way 
puff paste must be handled. To two cups of flour use 
one cup of firm butter. This should be unsalted. If 



202 



BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 



you have salted butter, wash it in cold water and dry 
it thoroughly with a napkin. Work about a handful 
of flour into the butter, then put it on ice. Add two 
yolks, a pinch of salt and enough water to the rest 
of the flour to make a stiff dough. Knead this until 
it does not stick to the hands or board. Then put it on 
ice for five minutes. Now roll it thin (about half an 
inch) on a floured board. Place the butter in the center 
of the dough (see Fig. 1.) and fold over it one half of 




the rolled dough (Fig. 2.), then the other half (Fig. 3.), 
and then each end over the other (Fig. 4). Place 
between two plates and put on ice for ten minutes. 
Now roll the dough very thin, then fold over three 
times (Fig. 5.), then fold each end, toward the center 
(Fig. 6) and finally fold over once more (Fig. 7). Or you 
may roll out into a long strip (Fig. 8) and fold over 
as shown in Fig. 9. The dough and atmosphere 
should be cold, in order that the butter does not melt 
into the dough. However, if this work is being done 



PIES. 203 

in the summer, when the air is necessarily warm, you 
will have to put the dougli on ice for ten minutes after 
each folding, before making the next fold. When used 
for very fine pastry puff paste is rolled and folded 
over nine and ten times; for pies, six or eight times. 
It is best to do this the day before using, and put the 
paste on ice until the next day. It will remain in good 
condition (on ice) five days. 

669. PUFF PASTE No. 2. 

Máselné těsto na jiný způsoh. 
Wash in clear cold water a pound of butter, take 
off about two tablespoons and place the rest on ice, 
between two plates. Place on the board four cups of 
flour, mix with it the two tablespoons of butter, add 
three eggs, a dash of salt and enough cold water to 
form a stiff dough. Knead thoroughly and place on 
ice, between two plates. When the dough is cold and 
hard, roll. Roll out the butter, place it on the rolled 
dough, fold over three times, roll again, and fold over 
three times, then place on ice for half an hour. Then 
roll, turn over, fold as before, and roll out very thin. 
It is then ready for use. 

670. PIE CRUST. 

Pájové těsto. 
Add a cup of lard and a pinch of salt to a quart of 
sifted flour, work it in thoroughly, then add just 
enough cold water to make the dough stick together. 
Roll in one direction. You may add half a teaspoon 
of baking powder. This will make two pies, or four 
without the upper crust. If you wish richer crust, you 
may mix a quart of flour with a cup of lard and a cup 
of butter, adding two yolks, a pinch of salt and cold 
water. Pie crust may also be made by sifting two 
cups of flour with one even teaspoon of baking- 
powder and moistening with milk. It is not as good 
as the other.

747. PRESSBURG TOAST. 

Sucluiry prešpurské. 

Mix smooth a piece of compressed yeast with two 
cups of tepid milk, beat in enough flour to make a 
medium-thick batter and let it rise. If dry yeast is 
used, the batter must be prepared the evening before. 
When the batter is light, beat in, one at 41ie time, eight 
yolks, then add ten tablespoons of sugar, the grated 
rind of half a lemon and a pinch of nutmeg. Knead 
the dough well, but do not add much more flour. Roll, 
place in a baking pan about 8 x 14 inches, and when 
the dough has risen so it fills the pan three fourths 
full, bake in a moderate oven. When cold, cut in slices 
about half an inch thick, spread both sides with 
icing made of whites of eggs and sugar, sprinkle with 
chopped almonds or peanuts mixed with bread crumbs 
and sugar, arrange in a pan and toast a light brown 
in a slow oven. These will keep a long time, if put 
away in a dry place.

750. SANDWICHES. 

Sandvlce cili obložený cJileha. 
A sandwich consists of*two very thin slices of 
bread, with a thin slice of meat, cheese or various 
chopped mixtures spread between them. If buttering 
very thin slices of bread is difficult, butter before 
slicing. The daintiest and most appetizing sandwiches 
are those containing a rather moist filling, such as 
minced meat, eggs, etc, moistened with dressing, but 
it must not be too moist, lest the bread become soggy. 

Yeast and Bread. — Kvasnice a chleba. 

751. DRY HOP YEAST No. 1. 

8 licit c domácí l-vasnice. 
This is best when made in warm weather, as it 
dries quicker. Pour a quart of water over one fourth 
of a i)ackage of lio])s and simmer about fifteen minutes, 
tlien cool. Strain and add to the water enough white 
flour to make a thin batter. Then add dry yeast dis- 



228 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

solved in tepid water or home made liquid yeast and 
beat well. If you wish more yeast, you may add 
warm water. After this has fermented thoroughly, 
stir a bit and let it rise again. Then stir in enough 
cornmeal to make a stiff dough. Knead thoroughly 
and roll thin, cut into small squares and lay them 
on a board sprinkled with corn meal. Dry outside 
in the open, turning each day, and taking it in at night. 
When thoroughly dry, hang in a dry place in clean 
bags. This yeast lasts a long time and is very good. 

752. DRY HOP YEAST No. 2. 

Suché domácí kvasnice na jiný způsob. 
Dissolve a piece of yeast in tepid water and mix 
with flour to make a sponge as for bread. Do this in 
the afternoon. In the morning boil three peeled and 
sliced potatoes in two quarts of water about ten 
minutes, then add five cents ' worth of dry hops and 
a tablespoon of salt and boil longer. When done, 
strain into cornmeal, add a cup of sugar, and stir into 
a stiff dough. When cot)l, add the raised batter pre- 
pared the day before, let it rise one hour, then add 
enough cormeal to make the dough stiff as for bread. 
Let this rise again, then roll, cut into squares and dry 
by the fire or in the sun. One piece of this yeast is 
sufficient for six loaves of bread. 

753. DRY HOP YEAST No. 3. 

Suché domácí kvasnice ještě na jiný způsob. 
Peel and boil two large potatoes in a quart of 
water with two ounces of hops. Boil half an hour, 
cool and strain. Sift corn meal, add a teaspoon of 
sugar and the hop water, making a stiff dough. While 
the hops are boiling, dissolve one cake of yeast in 
tepid water, beat smooth with enough flour to make a 
thin batter, let it rise and then add it to the dough. Let 
this rise, then knead on the board with corn meal, until 
the dough is very stiff. Roll half an inch thick, cut into

squares and dry in a shady place, turning daily. When 
thoroughly dry hang in a dry place in clean bags. 

754. BUTTERMILK YEAST. 

Kvasnice z podmásU. 
Dissolve three cakes of dry yeast in a cup of tepid 
potato water. Heat two quarts of buttermilk, add 
enough cornmeal to form a stiff batter and boil thor- 
oughly, stirring occasionally. When done, turn into 
another dish, cool and when cold, pour the dissolved 
yeast into the batter and let the mixture rise over 
night. In the morning add enough cornmeal to make 
the dough very stiff, roll thin, cut into squares and 
dry. 

755. HOME MADE YEAST. 

Domácí Icvasnice. 
Add six large peeled and grated potatoes to three 
quarts of boiling water, let it boil a moment or two, 
then take away from the stove, add a tablespoon of 
sugar and when it has cooled so that it is tepid, add 
a pint of liquid yeast, or two cakes of dry yeast dis- 
solved in tepid water. Mix well. After standing all 
day in a warm kitchen the yeast is ready for use. One 
cup of this yeast will be enough for one large loaf or 
more. 

756. STARTER. 

liidlic domácí kvasnice. 
Boil six peeled potatoes in a gallon of water, in 
the evening. Strain, saving the water, mash the pota- 
toes and press them through a sieve. When the pota- 
toes are cool, pour over them the water in which they 
have boiled, add one piece of dry yeast or one piece 
of compressed yeast, dissolved in tepid water, or one 
cup of liquid yeast, a cup of sugar, half a cup of salt, 
mix, and let it stand until morning. In the morning 
pour off a pint of this yeast for future use and use 
tlie remainder for making bread. This starter is used in- 
stead of the regular sponge, that is, you may set the 



230 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

dough with it in the morning when you want to bake. 
Put a pint of the starter in a Mason jar and keep in a 
cool place for future use. If will keep two weeks. When 
ready to bake bread the next time, boil potatoes and 
proceed as directed, adding the starter instead of yeast. 
If you do not make enough bread to use a gallon of 
water, use less potatoes, etc. 

757. WHEAT BREAD No. 1. 

Pšeničný chléb. 

For three loaves of bread use one cup of liquid 
yeast or one cake of dry yeast (this should be 
soaked half an hour in tepid water). Pour the liquid or 
soaked yeast into a crock, add a cup of tepid water 
and enough sifted flour to make a thin batter, as for 
pancakes. Beat w^ell and put in a warm place to rise. 
In the winter the batter or sponge is made in the 
afternoon before baking. In warm weather set the 
sponge in the evening and in very hot weather late 
in the evening. If- the sponge rises too quickly, it 
sours or ferments. When this occurs, it may be re- 
medied by adding a pinch of baking soda moistened 
with hot water. 

In the morning add a quart of tepid water to the 
sponge, a dash of salt and a teaspoon of sugar. One 
or two grated potatoes will add to the flavor of the 
bread. Then add enough flour to make the dough 
medium stiff. Beat thoroughly with a wooden paddle, 
then knead on the board, adding flour, until the dough 
does not stick. Place the dough in the crock and let 
it rise double its bulk. The time for this varies from 
one and a half to two hours, depending upon the 
amount of yeast and the atmosphere. The quicker 
the dough rises, the lighter the bread will be. 

When the dough has risen, knead again about 
five minutes and let it rise once more, fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Then form loaves and x>la<:*e them in buttered 
l^ans, letting them rise double their bulk. When indi- 



BREAD. 231 

vidiial bread pans are not used, two or tliree loaves 
may be formed and put in one pan, buttering the sides 
of each loaf, so that they may be easily taken apart 
after they are done. Rub the top with lard and bake. 
The oven should not be too hot. The proper test 
is when the heat is such that you can keep your hand 
in while quickly counting twenty. After the bread is 
in the oven, the heat should be kept even for forty- 
five minutes, then it may be lessened until the bread 
is done. Bread, like cake, is done when it has shrunk 
from the sides of the pan and is a nice brown color. 

758. WHEAT BREAD No. 2. 

Fšeničnij cliJéb na jiný zpi'isoh. 
Make a sponge with a pint of starter described 
in recipe No. 756 and let is rise in a warm place. It 
should be ready in an hour. Add enough flour to

cribed in the preceding recipe. 

759. POTATO SPONGE BREAD. 

Chleh s hramhorouým kvósl^eni. 
Peel and boil six large potatoes, then drain, 
mash and pour over them three pints of tepid 
water and drain through a colander. Add enough 
sifted flour to make a thin batter and then add a cup 
of liquid yeast. When this has risen, add enough 
sifted flour to make a medium stiff dough, beat well 
and let it rise. When it has risen, add enough flour 
to make a' stiff dough and let it rise again. When it 
has risen, make loaves and let them rise once more in 
the pans, then bake. 

760. MILK SPONGE BREAD. 

Mléčný cliléh. 
Mix together two cups of boiling water, a teaspoon 
of sugar, a fourth of a teaspoon of salt and a fourth 
of a teaspoon of baking soda. Allow this to become 
tepid, then add enough flour to make a rather thick 
batter. Beat two minutes, then set the vessel in another 



232 BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

containing warm water, but not too hot, so the batter 
would not be injured. Keep at even heat until the 
batter rises. If you set this in the morning, it should 
be ready for mixing by eleven oclock. Use milk in- 
stead of water when mixing, and proceed as shown in 
the preceding recipes, being careful not to let the dough 
rise too much. 

761. BROWN BREAD. 

Hnědý chleb. 
Mix a quart of corn meal, two cups of rye flour 
(sifted), a cup of New Orleans molasses, a teaspoon of 
baking soda dissolved in hot water and enough sour 
milk to make the batter thicker than for pancakes, 
add salt, and beat well. Pour into pans and bake four 
hours in a slow oven. 

762. BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

Bostonský Jmédý cliléh. 
Mix two cups of corn meal, one cup of rye flour, 
half a cup of syrup, a heaping teaspoon of baking soda 
dissolved in hot water and added to three cups of sour 
milk, salt and beat thoroughly. Place in a round tin 
(a lard bucket, coffee can etc.) and steam four hours, 
then place in the oven for twenty minutes. 

763. GRAHAM BREAD. 

GrahamsJcý chléb. 
Graham bread may be made with yeast, the same 
as white bread. With soda it is made as follows: mix 
together two cups of sweet milk with nearly two-thirds 
of a cup of molasses, a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of 
baking soda dissolved in hot water. Beat well, add a 
quart of Graham flour, beat thoroughly and bake 
forty-five minutes in a slow oven. 

764. RYE BREAD No. 1. 

Žitný chléb. 
When making rye bread, it is best to leave a 
piece of dough from one baking to the next, about 



BREAD. 233 

two tablespoons. The day before baking, pour about 
two cups of, tepid water on this dough, to pro- 
perly moisten it. Stir it up in the evening, add enough 
flour to make batter as for pancakes, and let it stand 
over night in a warm place to rise. If you have not 
a piece of dough to begin with, dissolve a piece of dry 
or compressed yeast in two cups of tepid water the 
evening before baking, or use a cup of liquid yeast, 
add enough rye flour to make batter somewhat thicker 
than for pancakes, beat smooth, add a pinch of fennel 
or caraway seed, or both, and let the batter rise over 
night in a warm place. In the morning add a quart 
of tepid water in which you have dissolved a fourth 
of a teaspoon of baking soda, salt, arid enough rye 
flour to make a stiff dough. Beat with a wooden 
paddle until the dough does not stick, sprinkle with 
flour, cover with a napkin and let it rise half an hour. 
Then knead the dough on the board, make a loaf and 
let it rise in the pan. Bake in a hot oven. One quart 
of water and four pounds of flour will make one loaf, 
but as flours vary, the cook must use her experience 
to guide her in this matter. You may use part milk, 
whey or sour milk, — the bread will be better and' 
more digestible. 

765. RYE BREAD No. 2. 

Žitný chléb na jiný způsob. 

Boil three large peeled potatoes in two quarts of 
water the evening before baking. When boiled until 
nearly dissolved, press through a sieve, and if the 
water has boiled away, add enough cold water to make 
two quarts, then add half a cup of flour, a cake of 
compressed yeast dissolved in tepid water, beat and 
set in a warm place over night. In the morning add 
a pinch of salt and enough rye flour to make batter 
as for pancakes, let it rise half an hour. Then pour 
on a floured board, add more flour and knead until

Raised Tarts and Cakes. — Koláčky, koláče 

a buchty. 

m 
In order to make good pastry, especially that 

composed of raised dough, the cook must observe 
several rules. The flour should be of good quality, 
dry and warm, the butter, eggs and yeast must be 
fresh. When setting the sponge, the milk or water 
must be tepid, never hot. Compressed yeast seems to 
give more satisfactory results than dry yeast. Half 
an ounce of fresh compressed yeast is about right 
to one pound of flour. However, the richer the 
dough, the more yeast it will require. In order to be 
sure that the yeast is fresh, mix it with several table- 
spoons of tepid milk, add a teaspoon of sugar and two 
or three teaspoons of flour, beat and set in a warm 
(not hot) place. If it begins to bubble and foam 
within a short time, the yeast is good. You may then 
mix the other ingredients together, add the sponge, 
beat very thoroughly until the dough glistens and 
does not stick, then set again in a warm place. The 
dough must be right, the oven must be right, and the 
baking must be done right. Success depends on all 
these things, not on any one of them. If the oven 
bakes too quickly on the under side, set the pan on a 
tin plate or iron stand, if too quickly on top, cover 
with a paper.

cool, (that is, not very warm), place to rise. Take 
a cup of unsalted butter. If salted, wash thoroughly 
in cold water, dry and place on ice. When the dough 
has risen, let it get cool and roll it out about half an 
inch thick. Then roll out the butter, making a smaller 
piece than the' dough, so that when you place the 
rolled butter on the rolled dough, there will be an 
inch-wide edge of dough all around. Then fold over 
as illustrated in the recipe for making puff paste, 
(recipe 668). With a rolling pin beat the folded dough 
lightly, roll again, fold, beat and repeat this once more,

well, then add enongh flonr to make the dongh not 
qnite as stiff as for noodles. Roll as thin as for 
noodles and cnt with five different sized cntters, one 
just a little smaller than the other. Beat the white, 
rub the center of the largest piece, place the next 
size on it, rub this in the center with the white 
and so continue until you have all five. In doing this, 
care must be taken not to rub more than the center 
with the white, as the cakes would stick together. 
Merely rub the center with your finger dipped in 
the.wliite, making a little dent at the same time, to 
press the pieces together. When you have all done this 
w^ay, fry carefully in hot deep fat. When done, place a 
bit of jam or jelly in the center of each or a bit of beaten 
white sprinkled with red sugar. If these are made right, 
they are very pretty, as the edges rise up in frying, so 
that each rosette looks like a real rose.

Cakes, — Dorty. 

Layer Cakes. — Skládané Dorty. 

In order to make good cakes, all the ingredients 
must be fresh and of good quality, properly put 
together, and the oven must be heated so that no fuel 
need be added during the baking. If the oven is too 
hot for baking layer cakes, the layers crack on the 
surface; if not hot enough, the dough shrinks and 
does not rise properly. When baking a laj^er cake, do 
not open the oven during the first ten minutes. 
Measure the flour after sifting, it may be sifted four 
or five times. To each cup of flour add a teaspoon 
of baking powder. Use finely granulated sugar. The 
eggs should be cold, as tlie whites beat stiffer that 
way. A pinch of salt added to the whites helps to 
make them stiffer. Stir the batter in a crock, using 
a wooden spoon or paddle. Grease the pans with cold 
butter or lard and dust evenly with flour. Let the 
cake cool before applying icing or frosting. When 
putting the ingredients together, do it thus: cream 
the butter, then add sugar gradually, cream the two 
together, then add the beaten yolks and flavoring, 
then add the flour and milk, alternately, a small 
quantity at the time, stirring until smooth, then fold 
in carefully the whites beaten stiff. The cups used as 
measure in the following recipes are ordinary coffee 



254 ^ BOHEMIAN-AMERICAN COOK BOOK. 

cups, containing- one half pint each. Layer cakes require 
a hotter oven than loaf cakes. When the cake shrinks 
from the sides of the pan, it is done. Another test is 
inserting a tooth-pick and if nothing adheres to it, the 
cake is baked.

Jellies are made by boiling together the juice of 
fruit that is not too ripe, and sugar. The fruit is 
boiled soft and the juice strained through a jelly bag. 
If strained first through a sieve and then through 
the bag, it will be clearer. Do not press the juice 
through the jelly bag, it must drip of its own weight, 
and this is best done by letting it drip overnight. The 
strained juice is boiled with sugar (which should be 
heated before adding it to the juice) and it should 
boil over a quick fire. As the jelly bubbles up quite 
a bit, it is more convenient to make a small quantity 
at the time. Skim while boiling. Try it by pouring a 
bit on a cold plate. If it coagulates sufficiently, you 
may pour it into glasses immediately. When cool place 
a round piece of white paper dipped in rum in each 
glass and cover. Or you may seal with hot ])a]*affin.

Preserves. — Zavařeniny. 
General Directions. — Všeobecná pravidla. 

Before beginning this work, look over the jars. 
See that none are cracked or injured in any way, and 
that each has the proper cover. Never use old rubber 
bands. They do not cost much and it is far cheaper 
to buy a new supply each time than to waste the pre- 
serves. Fruit for preserving should be sound, ripe 
and firm. Juicy fruit, such as berries, is picked over 
and washed. Larger firmer fruit, as apples, quinces 
etc. must be peeled and parboiled first. When the 
fruit is preserved, fill the jars with it, having first 
scalded them well. It is best to have several jars stand- 
ing in a large pan of hot water, and as these are filled, 
replace with a new supply. Have ready an ordinary 



PRESERVES. 293 

boiler for clothes, place laths or straw in the bottom, 
screw the covers loosely on the ,iars and put same in the 
boiler, having filled them with the preserved fruit. 
Pour in cold water so it reaches about an inch 
lower than the lower edge of the covers, and when it 
has come to a boil, boil ten minutes, then take out the 
jars, and when cold, tighten the covers thoroughly. 
When entirely cold, dip the top of each jar in melted 
paraffin, being careful to coat the space around the 
lower edge of the cover. Then put the preserves away 
in a cool, dry place. Examine them within a few days 
and occasionally thereafter, for if they ferment and 
you discover it in time, you may remedy the matter 
by boiling the fruit over and resealing. . 

955. PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 

Zavařené jahody. 

Pick over ten or twelve quarts of berries, wash 
and drain well. Boil two pounds of white sugar with 
half a cup* of water ten minutes in an enameled kettle. 
Now add the berries to the boiling syrup and boil 
about twenty-five minutes, skimming often, but not 
stirring, so as not to mash the fruit. Then take the 
berries out with a skimmer, put them in the jars, 
being careful not to break them, boil the syrup down, 
pour it over the fruit, filling each jar quite full. Place 
the jars in the boiler and proceed as directed. 

956. PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Zavařené broskve.

300 BOHEMIAN-AMEEICAN COOK BOOK. 

979. PICKLED MUSHROOMS. 

Naložené liouhy. 
Wash, cut off the stems and put the mushrooms 
in cold water. Boil together vinegar, sliced onion, 
whole pepper, allspice and salt, and when it begins to 
boil, add the mushrooms and let them simmer five 
minutes. Then drain, put them in glass jars, pour 
over them the cooled vinegar with which you have 
boiled a few cloves and whole peppers and seal. 

980. PICKLED DILL. 

Naložený hopr. 
Wash the fresh dill leaves, put in a kettle, cover 
with wine vinegar, a few whole peppers and cloves 
and simmer a few minutes. Take off the stove, cool, 
put into jars and cover tight. The dill must be 
submerged in the vinegar and if this dries out, add 
more. 

981. CHOW-CHOW. 

Ůaii-čau. 
Chop half a peck of green tomatoes, one large 
head of cabbage, a dozen ripe and a dozen green 
peppers and a dozen onions, each separately, then mix, 
salt, put in a sack and let the contents drain over 
night. In the morning squeeze dry, put in a kettle, 
cover with cold vinegar, let it stand six hours and then 
squeeze dry again. Then add a cup of whole and a cup 
of ground cinnamon, three tablespoons of celery seed, 
a tablespoon of ground mace, three tablespoons of 
allspice and a quart of grated horseradish. Mix well, 
place in glass or stone jars and cover with hot vinegar 
boiled with a pound of sugar. * The chowchow must be 
covered with the vinegar. When cool put into jars and 
cover these. 

982. SOURKRAUT. 

Kyselé zelí. 
Take off the outer leaves, quarter the heads of 
cabbage, and cut out the stalks. Slice fine, using a 



PICKLES. 301 

sourkraut cutter. The cutter is placed over a tub and 
the kraut sliced into same. When the desired quantity 
has been sliced, work in salt, using a pound and a half 
to five dozen large heads, two tablespoons of caraway 
seed and the same amount of dill seed. Mix well with 
the kraut. Line the bottom of a firm oak barrel, or 
keg, or large stone jar with nice whole cabbage leaves. 
Put in a layer of kraut, pound thoroughly with a heavy 
wooden masher, put in another layer and pound, and 
so proceed until the keg is full. Do not put in too 
large a layer, as the kraut must be pounded until it 
exudes moisture. Cover with whole cabbage leaves, 
then with a clean white wet cloth, put on a lid that 
fits inside of the barrel and place on the top of this 
a heavy weight. Place the barrel in a warm spot and 
let it stand there eight days until the kraut ferments, 
then put it in a cool spot, where it will not freeze. Every 
time you take any kraut, level the top and put a clean 
white wet cloth on it, washing the cloth each time. 
If you make a large quantity that lasts quite a while, 
you must wash the board and stone occasionally. If 
the kraut dries, you must add water. Some house- 
wives add fennel seed, mustard, pepper or juniper 
berries. Peeled and grated apples, added to each 
layer, give a good flavor. If you put the kraut in a 
barrel that contained white wine, the flavor will be 
better. Do not use too much salt, in that case the 
kraut will not ferment. It is better to use several 
smaller kegs than one large barrel. You may put the 
kraut in large stone jars, if you wish. 

983. STUFFED PICKLED MANGOES. 

Naložená nadívaná yaprika. 

Select large fine mangoes or green peppers, slit 
each in the side and take out the seeds. Cover with

Beverages. — Nápoje. 

984. COFFEE. 

Káva. 

For five cups of coffee three heaping tablespoons 
of coarsely ground coffee are generally used. Add the 
coffee to water boiling in the pot, let it boil up a 
few times, then take from the fire and let it settle. A 
bit of cold water added after it is done, or a small 
quantity of the white of an egg, or a bit of whole 
beaten Qgg mixed with water, stirred into the coffee 
grounds before boiling, clears coffee. 

985. FRENCH COFFEE.

to a powder. The prepared cocoa is not as pure. Use 
one teaspoon of ground cocoa to each cup of milk. 
When the milk comes to a boil, add the cocoa which 
has been mixed smooth with hot or cold water. This 
is the average proportion, it can be varied to suit the 
individual taste.

1000. ELDER BLOSSOM WINE. 

Bezinkové víno. 
Pick over ten quarts of nice elder blossoms. Put 
five gallons of water to boil. When it boils add the 
blossoms, stir thoroughly, take the kettle off the stove, 
cover and let it stand twenty-four hours. The next 
day strain through a four sack into a vessel. Put 
five gallons of water to boil, add twenty-five or 
thirty pounds of sugar, seven large or ten small 
lemons, sliced and seeded, and, of you like, a quan- 
tity of raisins. Boil about fifteen minutes, then strain 
and cool and add it to the elder blossom water. The 
lemons must not soak too long, or they will impart 
a bitter flavor. When the mixture has become tepid, 
add five cakes of dissolved compressed yeast, stir 
well, cover and let it stand a few hours. When it 
begins to foam, strain into a keg but do not cork. As 
the wine ferments, the quantity lessens somewhat, so 
reserve enough to add, keeping the keg full. If you 
do not have enough, boil water and sugar and use that. 
When the wine ferments but slightly, put the cork in 
the opening, but do not press it in. As the fermenting 
grows weaker, tighten the cork. When you see that 
the wine does not ferment at all, cork tightly. Let it 
stand two months, then drain with the aid of a small 
hose into another keg, as the bottom of the first keg 
will be covered with a sediment. It can than be used, 
but the older it is, the better.

pages size 6x9, clothbovind. price $4.25 postpaid. 



The Hussite Wars 

by the Count Luetzow. 



The sequel to "Life and Times of M. John Hus" is mainly 
founded on documents written in the Bohemian language, 
most of whicli are quite unknown to Englisli readers. 
The Hussite movement has g^enerally been viewed as an 
almost exclusively religious one. Ct. Luetzow proves that 
though the religious motive was undoubtedly the most 
prominent one, two other currents of thoug'ht also con- 
tributed largely to the outbreak of the Hussite wars. Ct. 
Luetzow's accounts of the battles of the Hussite wars, 
founded on the narrative of the contemporary chroniclers, 
throw much light on the Hussite system of warfare which 
belongs to a period of transition. The Count draws our 
attention to the protagonist of the Hussite wars, John 
Zizka of Trocnov, the most picturesque and the most in- 
teresting figure of that period. — .384 pages 6x9, illustrated,
