THE 




THE 



Country Lady s 

C T OR 




JANUART. 

Shall in this Month take parti- 
cular notice of the Pigeon, 
whofe Charaderifticks are chief- 
ly to have fhort Legs, and their " 
Feet of a reddifh Colour, to 
have long Wings,and to be quick 
of Flight 5 in which the fprcading of their Tail- 
Feathers greatly Ipntribute, as well as to guide 
them in t he Air. They lay for the mofi: part 
two Eggs for one fitting, and no more- 5 but 
breed often in the Year. When Pigeons are 
once paired, it is obfervcd they are very con- 
ftant to one another, and affift each other in 
the Incubation or Sitting on the Eggs, as well 
as in bringing up and feeding the young ones 5 
and moreover it is remarkable^ that a Pigeon 
has no Gali- Bladder. 

ThG: 



i, Tthe Country Ladfs 

The forts are, firft, the blue wild tigcoii, 
which isthemoft frequent in Dove- Cotes, but 
is not very large, nor difpofed to breed fo early 
in the Spring as fome others : they are, how- 
ever, a hardy kind, and will thrive any where, 
if there is plenty of Water 5 for tho'they ate 
not of a watery Race, yet it is obfervable, that 
they covet to be where it is, and that they feed 
frequently upon the Banks of Rivers and Ponds. 
I have known that where there were two Dove- 
Cotes, that ftood within a Mile of one another, 
and one of them was near a River, and the 
other remote from it, the Pigeons of the Houf e 
diftant from the Water, left their Habitation 
to refide in that next the River, even tho' they 
had an Allowance of good Feed at liome. 

Among the tame Pigeons, thofe which the 
Italians caird Tronfo, and we Runts, are the 
largefl: 5 but thefe may be again diftinguifh'd 
under the Charafters of greater and fmaller : 
thofe which are commonly caii'd the Spani^ 
Runts, are very much efteem'd, being the largeft 
fort of Pigeon, and are fluggifh, and more flow 
of flight, than the fmaller fort of Runts 3 but 
the fmaller Runts are better Breeders, and 
quick of flight, which is to be efl:eem'd j be- 
caufe if they were to feek their Food far, they 
can range much more Ground, or return home 
much quicker on occafion of flormy or wet 
Weather. As for the Colours of their Feathers, 
they are uncertain, fo that one cannot judge 
of the fort by them. 

The 



Director. 5 

The next, which makes the largeft Figure, 
bat is not in reality the largcft Bird, is th^ 
Cropper 5 itisfo named, becaufethey ufually 
do, by attrafting the Air, blow up their Crops 
to an extraordinary bignefs, even io fometimes 
as to be as large as their Bodies. This fort is 
efteemed the better, as it can Iwell its Crop to 
the largeft Size. The Bodies of this fort arc 
about the bignefs of the fmaller Runt, but fomc- 
what more (lender. This fon, like the former, 
is of various Colours in the Feathers. 

The next are thofe Pigeons call'd Shakers, 
and are faid to be of two forts, 'viz. the broad- 
tail'd Shaker, and the narrow-tail'd Shaker: 
The reafon which is allign'd for calling them 
Shakers, is, becaufe they are almoft conftant in 
wagging their Heads and Necks up and down i 
and the Diftinftion made between the broad 
and narrow- taird Shaker, is, becaufe the broad- 
taifd fort abounds with Tail-Feathers, about 
twenty-fix in number, as Mr. Ray obferves, and 
the narrow-taird Shakers have fewer in number, 
Thefe,when they walk, carry their Tail-Feathers 
ereft, and fprcad abroad like a Turkey-Cock. 
They iikewife have diverfity of Feathers. 

The next 1 fhali take notice of, are the Jaco- 
bines, or Cappers : Thefe are called Cappers 
from certain Feathers which turn up about the 
back part of the Head. There are of thefc 
that are rough-footed $ thefe are fhort-biird, 
the Iris of their Eye of a Pearl Colour^ and the 
Head is commonly white. 

The 



^' Tthe Country Ladfs 

The next is the Turbit, commonly fo caird^ 
but what is the occafion of the Name, is not 
known, unlefs Turbit y or Turbeck^ is a Cor 
ruption of the Word Cortbeck, or Cortbeke- 
which is the Name the Hollanders give them, 
and feems to be derived from the French^ 
where Court bee would fignify a ihort Bill, 
which this Pigeon is remarkable for ; the Head 
is flat, and the Feathers on the Breaft fpread 
both ways- Thefe are about the bignefs of the 
Jacobines. 

The Carrier Pigeon is the next I fhall take 
notice of 5 it is fo call'd from the Ufe which 
is fometimes made of them in carrying of Let* 
ters to and fro : It is very fure that they are 
nimble Meffengers, for by experience it is 
found, that one of thefe Pigeons will fly three 
Miles in a Minute, or from St. Albans to Lon- 
don in fevcn Minutes, which has been try'd ; 
and I am informed, that they have been fent 
of a much longer Meflage : however, they 
might certainly be made very ufeful in Dif- 
patches, which required fpeed, if we were to 
train them regularly between one Houfe and 
another. We have an account of them pafllng 
and repafling with Advices between Hirtius 
and Brutus y at the Siege of Modena, who had, 
by laying Meat for them in fome high Places, 
inftrufted their Pigeons to fly from place to, 
place for their Meat, having before kept them 
hungry, and fhut up in a dark Place. Thefe 
are about the fize of common Pigeons, and of 
a dark blue or blackifh Colour, which is one 

way 



Director. ^ 

way of diftinguifhin-g them from other forts: 
they are alfo remarkable for having their Eyes 
compafsM about with a broad Circle of naked 
fpungy Skin, and for having the upper Chap of 
their Beak covcr'd more than half from the 
Head with a double Cruft of the like naked 
fungous Body. The Bill, or Beak, is mode- 
rately long, and black. Thefe Birds are of that 
Nature, that tho' they are carried many Miles 
from the place where they were bred, or 
brought up, or have themfelves hatch'd, or bred 
up any young ones, they will immediately re- 
turn home as foon as we let them fly. Per- 
haps this may, in fome meafure, depend upon 
the Affedion the Male or Female bear to 
one another. When they are to be ufed as 
Carriers, two Friends muft agree to keep them, 
one in Londoriy and the other at Guilford, or 
elfewhere 5 the Perfon that lives at Guilford 
mufl: take two or three Cocks or Hens that 
were bred at his Friend's at London^ and the 
other two or three that were bred at Guilford 5 
when the Perfon at London has occafion to 
fend an Exprefs, he muft roll up a little piece 
of Paper, and tie it gently with a fmall String 
pafs*d thro' it about the Pigeons Neck. But it 
muft be obferv'd before, that the Pigeons you 
defign to fend with a Mcffage, be kept pretty 
much in the dark, and without Meat, for eight 
or ten Hours before you turn them out, and 
they will then rife and turn round till they have 
found their way, and continue their Flight till 
they have got home. With two or three of 

B thefe 



6 The Country Ladfs 

thefe Pigeon s on each fide", a Correfpondencc 
might be carried on in a very expeditious man- 
ner, cfpecially in Matters of Curiofity, or thofe 
things which tend to publick Good. 1 know 
a Gentleman that has fet out on a Journey early 
in the Morning, where it was judged to be 
dangerous travelling, that has taken one of this 
fort of Pigeons in his Pocket, and at his Jour- 
ney's End, which he tells me was near thirty 
Miles diftant from his Houfe, has turn'd off 
the Pigeon, and it has been at its feeding Place 
in nine or ten Minutes, with an Account of 
his fafety. In Ttirkey it is very cuftomary for 
thefe Pigeons to be taken on board a Ship that 
fails, by the Captain, and if any thing extraor- 
dinary happens within the diftance of fix or 
eight Leagues, the Pigeon is fent back with 
Advice, which fometimes may be a means of 
faving a Ship from being taken by the Py rates, 
or other Enemies, and expedite Trade. 

The Barbary Pigeon, or Barb, is another 
fort, whofe Bill is like that of the Turbit, i. c. 
fhort and thick, and abroad and naked Circle 
of a fpungy white Subftance round about the 
Eye, like that in the Carrier Pigeon, The Iris 
of the Eye is white, if the Feathers of the Pi- 
geon are inclining to a darkifh Colour ; but is 
red, if the Feathers are white, as wc find ia 
other white Birds. 

Smiters are another fort of Pigeon, fuppos'd 

to be the fame that the Hollanders call ^rai- 

jers. This fort fhake their Wings as they fly, 

and rife commonly in a circular manner in their 

flight ; 



blRECTOR. f 

flight 5 the Males for the moft part riling higher 
than the Females, and frequently falling and 
flapping them with their Wings, which pro- 
duces a noife that one may hear a great way ^ 
from whence it happens that their Q^iill-Fea- 
thers are commonly broken or fhatter'd. 
Thefe are almoft like the Pigeon caird the 
Tumbler 5 the difference chiefly is, that the 
Tumbler is fomething fmaller, and in its flight 
will turn itfelf backward over its Head. The 
diverfity of colours in the Feathers makes no 
difference. 

The Helmet is another kind of Pigeon di- 
ftinguifli'd from the others, becaufe it has the 
Head, the Qaill-Feathers, and the Tail-Feathers 
always of one colour : Sometimes black, 
fometimes white, or red, or blue, or yellow i 
but the other Feathers of the Body are of a 
different colour. 

The next Pigeon I fhall take notice of, is 
that which is call'd the light Horfeman ; this is 
fuppofed to be a crofs flrain between a Cock 
Cropper and a Hen of the Carrier Breed, be- 
caufe they feem to partake of both, as appears 
from the cxcrefcent Flefh on their Bills, and 
the fwelling of their Crops ; but lam not de- 
termin d concerning that point, nor can give 
any good Judgment about it, till I have (cca 
whether the Cropper be the Male or Female, 
upon which depends a Debate in Natural Philo- 
fophy, which has not been yet decided ; this 
fort however is reckoned the beft Breeder, and 
are not inclind to leave the place of their 

B z Birtha 



8 The Country Lady's 

Birth, or the Houfe where they have been ac- 
cuftom'd. 

The Baflard bill Tigeon is another fort, 
which is fomewhat bigger than the Barbary 
Pigeon ; they have fhort Bills, and are gene- 
rally faid to have red Eyes, but I fuppofe thofe 
coloured Eyes are belonging only to thofe which 
have white Feathers. 

There is aifo a Pigeon calfd the Turnery 
which is faid tohavea Tuft of Feathers hanging 
backward on the Head, which parts, as yix.Ray 
fays, like a Horfe's Main. 

There is afmaller fort than the former calfd 
t\\z Finikiny but in other refpefts like the for- 
mer. There is a fort of Pigeon calfd the Spoty 
fuppos'd, and with good Judgment, to take its 
Name from the Spot on its Forehead juft above 
its Bill, and the Ecathers of its Tail always of 
the fame colour with the Spots, and all the 
other Feathers are white. 

Laftly, I fhall take notice of the Pigeon 
caird thcMazz^mety ov Mahomet , fuppofedto 
be brought from Turkey ; however, it is fingu- 
lar for its large black Eyes 5 the other parts are 
like thofe of the Barbary Pigeon. 

Thefe are the forrs of Pigeons generally 
known, for the l^ivg^c Italian Pigeons are only 
the larger Runts ; and I am of opinion, that 
the diverfity of colours in Pigeons only pro- 
ceeds from the diverfity of kinds of Pigeons, 
that couple with one another s fot I have 
known Swine that have been whole-footed, 
that have coupled with thofe that were cloven- 
footed. 



Director. 9 

footed, and the Pigs that were produced, 
were partaking of whole and cloven Hoofs, 
fome one, fome two cloven Hoofs, and the reft 
whole Hoofs. 

Concerning the Life of a Pigeon, Ariftotle 
fays, that a Pigeon will live forty Years, but 
Alberttis finifhes the Life of a Pigeon at 
twenty Years 5 however, Aldrovandus tells 
us of a Pigeon, which continued alive two 
and twenty Years, and bred all that time except 
the laft fix Months, during which fpace it had 
loft its Mate, and lived in Widowhood. There 
is a remarkable Particular mentioned by Aldro- 
'vandus relating to the Pigeon, which is, that the 
young Pigeons always bill the Hens as often as 
they tread them, but the elder Pigeons only 
bill the Hens the firft time before coupling. 
Tliny and Athenaus, from Ariftotle, tell us, 
that it is peculiar to Pigeons not to hold up 
their Heads/when they drink as other Birds and 
Fowls do, but to drink like Cattle by fucking 
without intermiflion ; it is eafily obferved, 
and worth Obfervation. " 

To diftinguifh which are the Males and Fe- 
males among Pigeons, it is chiefly known by 
the Voice and Cooing 5 the Female has a fmaU 
weak Voice, and the Male a loud and deep 
Voice. 

The Flefh of Pigeons is hard of Digeftion, 
and therefore is not judged a proper Supper- 
meaf^ it is faid to yield a melancholy Juice, 
but if boird arc very tender, or roafted while 
they are called Squabs, 'uiz. Pigeons about 

B 3 fou 



^lo The Country Ladfs 

four daj^s old, they arc much better for the Sto- 
mach, and then commonly yield, among the 
Curious in eating, about eighteen Pence, ox 
two Shillings a piece. The Food which is ge- 
nerally given to Pigeons is Tares 3 but if we 
were to mix Spurry-Seeds with it, or Buck- 
wheat, thofe Grains would forward their bree- 
ding, as has been try'd ; however, if Pigeons 
are fed only with TarcS;, and are of a good 
kind, we may exped them to breed nine or 
ten times in a Year 5 but fometimes, perhaps, 
not hatch above one at a time, tho' if they were 
in full Vigour, they would breed up a Pair at 
one fitting. 

In the feeding; of Pigeons, it is advifeable not 
to let them have more Meat at one time than 
they can eat, for they ajte apt to tofs it about, 
and lofe a ereat deal of it ; fo that the contri- 
vance of filling a (lone Bottle w^ith their Meat, 
and putting the Mouth downw^ards, fo that it 
may come within an Inch of a Plain or Table, 
and will give a fupply as they feed, is much 
the bcft way. And their drinking-water 
fhould be diipcnfed to them in the fame way 
iout of a Bottle reversed with the Mouth into a 
narrow fhallow Ciftcrn j but at the fame time 
they fhould not want the conveniency of a 
Pan of Water, it there can be no better had, 
to waih themfclves in, for they are of them- 
fclvcs a Bu-d fubjcd to contrad Dirt and Fleas. 
This is what 1 fhall fay of the breeding of tame 
Pigeons at prcfent. 

As 



Director. ji 

As to the preparing of Pigeons for the Tabic, 
they are commonly either roafted;, boiled, 
baked, or broiled , thefe are fo generally uq- 
derftood, that I need not mention them, nor 
that Parfley is almoft become neceffary with 
them either to be roafted or boiled in the Body 
of the Pigeon, or put in the Sauces for them : 
this every one knows, but that the^ Liver of 
the Pigeon fhould be always left in the Body 
of it, is not known every where, otherwife it 
would not be fo generally taken out and loft, 
as it is in many places remote from London s 
but this may be, perhaps, becaufe every one 
doesnotknow that a Pigeon has no Gall. As 
to particular ways of Dreffing of Pigeons, 
there are two or three which I think are excel- 
lent, The firft I had from a Lady in EJfex, 
whom I have had occafion to mention in this 
and other Works, and that is in rcfpcd to broil- 
ing of Pigeons whole. When the Pigeon is 
prepared for the Kitchen, tye the Skin of the 
Neck very tight with Packthread, and put into 
the Body a little Pepper, Salt, Butter, and a little 
Water at the Vent, and tie it up clofe at the 
Neck, broil this upon a gentle Fire, flowring 
it very w^ll, and bailing it with Butter. When 
this is brought to Table, it brings its Sauce in 
itfelf. To thofe who are not lovers of Spice 
or Salt, the Butter and Water will be fufficient 
to draw the Gravy in the Pigeon : b^at a Pigeon 
that is fplit and broiled is of a very different 
Tafte from this, and not worthy, in my opi- 
nion, to be reckon d with it, 

B 4 A no- 



1 1 The Country Ladys 

Another way of ordering Pigeons, which I 
met with by accident, and pleated me as well 
as fevcral Gentlemen in my Company, was the 
boiling of Pigeons in Paftc : The Receipt the 
People gave mc for it, was, to fill the Belly of 
the Pigeon with Butter, a little Water, fome 
Pepper and Salt, and cover it with a thin light 
Pafte, and then to put it in a fine Linen Cloth, 
and boil it for a time in proportion to its big- 
nefs, and fcrve it up. When this is cut open, 
it will yield Sauce enough of a very agreeable 
Reliili. 

Stewing ofTigeonSyfrom Monf, La Fountaine, 
an excellent Cook in Paris. 

ICK and wafn half a dozen Pigeons, and 
lay them into a Stew-Pan, with a Pint or 
more of good Gravy, an Onion cut fmall, or 
three or four large Shalots, a little Bunch of 
fweet Herbs, fome Pepper and Salt, a Pint of 
Mufnrooms that have been well cleaned, and 
cut into fmall Pieces, and a little Mace j let 
thefe ftevv gently till they are tender, and add 
to them about half a Pint of White- Wine juft 
before you take them oif the Fire; then lay 
your Pigeons in your Dilh, and brown your 
Sauce after 'tis difcharged of the Bunch of fweet 
Herbs and the Spice, which fhould be tied in 
a little Linen Cloth y pour then your Sauce 
"V^^ith the Mufhrooms over the Pigeons, and 
ftrew the whole over with grated Bread, giving 
it a browning with a red-hot ^'on 5 or tlie 
grated Bread may be omitted. 

An-

Another Way of dr effing Tigeons, 
from the fame. 

TAKE young Pigeons and par-boil them, 
then chop fome raw Bacon very fmall, 
with a little Parfley, a little fweet Marjoram, 
or fweet Bafil, and a fmall Onion ; fcafon 
this with Salt, and Pepper, and fill the Bodys 
of the Pigeons with it. When this is done, 
ftew the Pigeons in Gravy, or ftrong Broth, 
with an Onion ftuck with Cloves, a little Ver- 
juice and Salts when they are enough, take 
them out of the Liquor, and dip them in Eggs 
that have been well beaten, and after that roll 
them in grated Bread, that they may be cover'd 
with it. Then make fome Lard very hot, and 
fry them in it till they are brown, and ferve 
them up with fome of the Liquor they were 
ftew'd in, and fry'd Parfley. 

In the beginning of this Month, as well as 
in December y the Eel is commonly laid up in 
the Mud, and we find them there in Clufters 
folded one over another, which I fuppofe is the 
manner of coupling , for in the beginning of 
Marchy or end oi February , we fee young ones 
as fmall as Threads on the edges of the Waters. 
I think it is no longer to be doubted, but that 
the Eel is viviparous j that is, it brings its young 
ones perfedly framed, and docs not lay Spawn 
like other Fifh : and the Refemblancc the Eel 
bears to that Fifh, which is caird by the Fifher- 
mcnthe Coney- Fifh, and is found at this time 
about the Buoy in the Nore full of young ones, 

makes 



14 T^he Country Ladfs 

makes me the rather conclude the Eel brinss 
forth its Young perfedly form'd. This Fifh is 
not accounted wholefome at this time of the 
Year, nor fit for eating till they begin to run in 
March s therefore what 1 have to fay relating 
to preparing Eels for the Table, will be fet 
down in the Month oi March. 





FEBRV ART, 

S our Poultry will begin to lay plenti- 
fully in this Month, it may not be im- 
proper to fay fomething of them be- 
fore we proceed to give the Receipts 
for dreffing and preparing their Eggs for the 
Table. It is neceHary to be known firft, the 
Difference between Fowls and Birds 5 a Fowl 
always leads its young Ones to the Meat, and 
a Bird carries the Meat to the Youn^ : for this 
reafon, w^e find that Fowls always make their 
Nefts upon the Ground, while Birds, for the 
mod part, build their Nefts aiofc i fo then our 
common Poultry arc Fowls, the Phcafant, Par- 
tridge, Peacock, Turkey, Buftard, Quail, Lap- 
wing, Duck, and fuch like are all Fowls : But 
a Pigeon is a Bird> and a Stork, or Crane, and 
a Heron, are Birds, they build their Nefts aloft, 
and carry Meat to their young Ones. 

The Charaderiftick Marks o^ the Poultry 
Kind are, befides what I have faid abovC;. to 

have 



Director. if 

have fliort, ftrong, and fomcwhat crooked 
Bills, which are beft adapted to pick up Grains 
of Corn, Pulfe, and other Seeds, which is chiefly 
what thcfe Fowls feed upon 5 and we may 
obferve, that as neither Birds nor Fowls have 
Teeth to macerate their Food wath, fo Nature 
has provided them not only with a Crop to 
foften their Meat, but a Stomach furnifh'd with 
thick ftrong Mucles, whofe ufe is to grind the 
Grains of Corn, or any hard Meat fwallow'd 
whole, which they perform by the help of little 
Stones, which Birds and Fowls fwallow now 
and then, and which fupply the defed of Teeth. 
It is obfervable, that Fowls, for the moftpart, 
lay a greater number of Eggs than Birds, even 
many more than they can fit upon at one time. 
I have known about thirty Eggs lay'd by one 
common Poultry-Hen, but it is feldom that 
any Bird lays more than five or fix, except the 
Wren, and the Tom-tit, and the Pigeon not 
more than two. Again, the Poultry, contrary 
to others of the winged Race, are armed with 
Spurs 5 and it is obfervable, that the Cocks of 
the common Poultry difiinguifii themfelves 
from diurnal Fowls, by crowing or finging in 
the Night, as the Nightingale diftinguifhes itfelf 
from the refl: of the Bird- kind. As for the 
length of Life in common Poultry, Aldrovan- 
dus makes it to be about ten Years, but that 
the Cock becomes unfit for the Hens when he 
is four Years old j and we find by experience 
the fame, as well as that a Cock fhould not have 
more than fix or feven Hens, if we exped health-

fui and ftrong Broods of Chickens. About the 
Laying time of thefe Fowls, Spurry-Sccd and 
Buckwheat is an excellent ftrengthening Food 
lor them. 

There is another thing relating to Fowls of 
this kind well worthy obfcrvation j and that is, 
cf Capons being made to bring up a Brood of 
Chickens like a Hen, clucking of 'em, brooding 
them, and leading them to their Meat, with as 
much Care and Tend erne fs as their Dams would 
do. To bring this about, Jo, Bapttjia TortUy 
in lib. 4, Mag. Nat, prcfcribes to make a Ca- 
pon very tame and familiar, fo as to take Meat 
out of one's Hand ; then about Evening-time 
pluck the Feathers off his Bread, and rub the 
bare Skin with Nettles, and then put the 
Chickens to him, which will prefently run un- 
der his Breaft and Belly 5 the Chickens then 
rubbing his Breaft gently with their Heads, per- 
haps allay the flinging and itching occafioned 
by the Netties, or perhaps they may contribute 
to warm that part where the Feathers arc away : 
however, the bare part muft be rubb'd with 
Nettles three or four Nights fucccffively, till 
he begins to love and delight in the Chickens. 

When a Capon is once accuftomed to this 
Service, he will not eafiiy leave it off, but as 
loon as he has brought up one Brood of 
Chickens, we may put another to him, and 
when they are fit to fhift for themfelves, we 
may give him the Cage of a third. 

The forts of the Houfe Pullen, or common 
Poultry, arc many 5 but as the ufe of them for 

the 



Director. 17 

the Table is the fame, 1 fnall only take notice 
of fuch as are of the large Dunghill kind, or 
of the Hamburgh fort, of the Game kind, and 
of the frnall T)iitch kind ; which laft is admired 
by fome for the finenefs of their Flefli, and for 
being great Layers, efpecially in the Winter: 
But it is certain that the larger fort fell the bell 
at Marker, and lay the largeft Eggs, and there- 
fore fhould be the mod cultivated about a 
Farm. As for the Game Breed, fome fancy 
that their Flefh is more white and tender than 
the other forts 5 but they are always quarrelling, 
which contributes to make themfelves and their 
Brood weak. 

Where we propofe to raife a large Stock of 
Poultry, we fhould be careful to fecure our 
Hen-Houfe ffom Vermin of all forts, and keep 
it dry and clean, allowing alfo as much Air as 
poflible 5 for if it is not often clean d, the fccnc 
of the Dung will give your Fowls the Rood : 
So like wife there muftbe eafy Convenience for 
perching of the Fowls, difpofed in fuch a man- 
ner, that the Perches be not placed over any 
of the Hens Nefts, which mull always lie dry 
and clean, bedded with Straw, for Hay is apt 
to make the fitting Hens faint and weak. 
When we defign to fet a Hen, we fhould fave 
her Eggs in dry Bran, and when fhe clucks, put 
no more in her Neft than fhe can well cover ; 
for as to certain numbers to be more lucky in 
hatching, there is nothing in that : And if \vc 
fat Fowls, then ufe the Method prcfcribcd ia 
my Country Gentleman and Farmer'^ Monthly 



IS The Country Ladfs 

T}ire5tor^ in the Month of January y whicH 
is much the beft way of any that has yet been 
difcovered. In the choice of Fowls for eating, 
thofe which are white feathered and white 
legg'd, are much tenderer and finer in theii! 
Flefh than thofe of other Colours, and are 
much weaker; for which reafon, thofe who 
underftand Cocking, do not approve of fuch as 
happen to be white feather'd : and thofe which 
are black feathered, are accounted the hotted 
and moft fiery^ and their Flefh is coarfer than 
in other Fowls. But let us now come to the 
ufe of the Flefh of thefe Fowls, which is either 
eaten roafted, boiled, fricaffded, baked, or broil- 
ed either flit or whole. It is to be noted, that 
the Flefh of thefe Fowls or Chickens boiled 
is more eafily digefted than the Flefh of thofe 
that are roafted, and the Flefh of the Legs is 
more eafy of Digeftion than that of the Bread. 
Mr. Ray takes notice, that thofe parts of Fowls, 
which are continually in Adion, are edeem'd 
the bed, for which reafon he prefers the Legs 
of tame Fowls, and what we call the Wings 
in wild Fowl, that is, the flefhy part on the 
Bread. Gefner and Aldrovandus have both 
largely treated of the ufe of the Flefh and Eggs 
of thefe Fowls, but I believe fome of the fol- 
lowing Receipts for drefling them, will not 
be unacceptable, they being more adapted to 
the Tadc of our Times. 

I fhall begin with fome curious ways of dref- 
fing of Eggs, which I had from a Gentleman 
oiBriiJfels, who had colleded them from mod 
T^2ins oi Europe. Firji 



D I R E C T O k. 19 

Firji Way of dr effing of Eggs, 

Oil your Eggs till they are hard, and cut 
the Whites only into Rings or large pieces 5 
then cut fome Parfley and Onions fmall, and 
flevv them with a little Salt, Pepper, and Nut- 
meg in half a Pint of Water, till the Onion 
and Parfley is tender; when this is done, put 
in your Eggs well flower'd, and as foon as they 
ate hot, put half a Pint of Cream to them, and 
•thicken them for ferving at the Table. The 
Yolks may be fry'd to garnifh the Difh. 

Second Way of preparing of Eggs. 

"O Oil your Eggs hard as before, and cut the 
'^^ Whites like wife as direded in the above 
Receipt, and then prepare fome Gravy, a bunch 
of fweet Herbs, a little Salt, fome Lemon Peel, 
fome Jamaica Pepper beaten fmall, an Onion 
fhred fmall, and let thefe ftew together till it 
is fufficiently feafon'di after which, ftrain it off, 
and put in the Eggs to heat them thoroughly, 
and then thicken the whole with burnt Butter. 

Third Way of preparing of Eggs. 

T3 Rcak fome Eggs, beat them well, and fea- 
^^ fon, them with Salt and fome Jamaica Pep- 
per finely powder'd, then make fome Butter 
very hot in a Pan, and pour in the Mixture to 
fry, till it is hard enough to hold together ,• then 
it muft be taken out, and cut into feveral Pieces, 

and 



20 The Country Ladfs 

and fervcd with the fame Sauce direded in the 
foregoing Receipt, 

Fourth Way ofdrejjlng of Eggs. 

npAke the Hearts of two or three Cabbage- 
-*- Lettuces, a little Sorrel, Parfley, Cher- 
ville, and a large Mu|Tiroom, put them in Wa- 
ter over the Fire till they are tender, then chop 
them together Very fmall with fome Yolks of 
hard Eggs, and feafon the whole with SaU, 
Pepper, or Nutmeg; and when the Mafs is 
well mixt together, put them in pafte, making 
them into fmall flat Puffs, and fry them. This 
may be diverfify'd, by adding fome fweet Herbs 
chop'd fmall to the Mixture, before it is put 
into Pafte. 

Fifth Way of dr effing of Eggs. 

T> Eat as many Eggs as you think convenient, 
-■^ and at the fame time fqueeze the Juice of 
an Orange among them 5 being well beaten, 
feafon them with a little Salt, then take a Stew- 
Pan, and if it is a Faft-day, put fome Butter into 
it and pour in your Eggs, keeping them ftir- 
ring continually over the Fire till they are 
enough, then pour them into a Plate upon Sip- 
pets. But on Flefh-days, inftead of Butter ufc 
ftrong Gravy, or on Fifh-days fome Mufliroom- 
Gravy may be ufed inftead of Butter, or with 
it. 

Sixth 



Director, it 

Sixth Way of ordering of Eggs. 

Oil Eggs till they are hard, peel them, and 
cut them lengthways, then quarter each 
half, and dip the feveral quarters in Batter;, 
made of Flower^ Eggs and Milk 5 fry them thea 
in Butter very hot, over a quick FirC;, and lay 
them a while before the Fire to drain. In the 
mean while prepare for them the following 
Sauce of burnt or brown Batter, feafoned with 
Sweet-herbs, Salt, Pepper, Nutmeg, and a 
little Elder- Vinegar, with fome Mufhrooms 
ftew'd and hafll'd j and garnlfli your Difh, 6t 
Plate, with fry'd Bread, Parfley, and fry'd 
Mufhrooms. 

Thefe are a few out of many Receipts,' 
which the above Gentleman gave me, and may 
ferve as Diredions for many others 5 for by 
what I can find, all the others depend upon the 
fame Principles. The variation of thefe depends 
upon the variety of Taftes : Some like Amletts, 
or Frazes of Eggs, with Bacon, or with Clary, 
or other high-tafted Herbs, which every good 
Houfewife knows how to direft. The fame 
Gentleman obferves, that Amletts with boiled 
Artichoke Bottoms diced, Amletts with the 
Tops of boird Afparagus, green Peafe boiled, 
Mufhrooms ftew'd and fliced, or Truffles, thefe 
he tells me are extraordinary. 

As to the particulars relating to the drcffing 
of fatted Fowls, the methods which mod agree 
with my Palate, and have been admired by the 

C bed 



2 2 The Country Lady's 

bcft Judges of my Acquaintance, are the iol^ 
lowing, which I had from France. 

To drefs a Capon, or other Fowl. 

WHcn your Fowl is trufs'd for Roafting, co- 
ver the Breaft with a thin flice of fat Ba- 
con, and put an Onion ftuck with Cloves into 
the Belly, with feme Salt and Pepper $ when 
it is roafted enough, take off the Bacon, and 
ftrew it with grated Bread, till it is brown. 
This is eaten, either with Orange-Juice and 
Salt, or if Oyfters are at hand, as they are 
about many Farms in England^ they may be 
.ftew'd gently with a little White Wine, SpicC;, 
and a little Butter, which will make an agreea- 
ble Sauce for it. Or ^\i^ it m^ay be eaten with 
a very good Sauce, which I have often met 
with, and have lik'd as well $ which is made 
with fmall Beer and Water, equal quantities, 
an Onion flic'd, fome Pepper and Salt, and 
about an Ounce of Flefh, either of Mutton or 
Beef, to boil till it comes to about half, fup- 
pofing at jfirft'tis not above half a Pint 5 and at 
fome places, inftead of Mutton, c^r. this Sauce 
has been only made of the Neck of a Fowl, 
This Sauce, in my Opinion, has a very rich 
Tafte, and has been well approved of by fome 
curious Travellers : Where we could have this, 
we rather chofe it than Wine- Sauce. Capons, 
Pullets, or others of thisfortof Fowl, may be 
alfo larded wath Bacon, if they are roafted j 
but the Gentleman sforefaid, vvho gave me this 
Receipt, told me that no Water-Fowl muft be 
iardcd with Bacon. To

To farce or Jluff a Fowl. From il/r. Agnea-u. 

Wi-icn your Fov/1 is made ready for Roafling, 
take the Liver boil'd, a Shallot, a little ' 
Fat of Baeofi, feme grated Bread, the Bottom of 
a boird Artichoke, and fome Muflirooms, 
chop thefe very Imallj and make a fore ^ Meat 
of them, fealbn'd with Salt and Spices at plea- 
fare 5 fill the Belly of the Fowl with this, and 
then triifs it, covering the Breaft with a thin 
flice of fat Baeon, and over that put a piece of 
writing Paper. Road this, and fcrve it up with 
the foilow^ing Sauce : Aiake a hafh of Mufh- 
roorns, an Anchovy, a few Capers and fome 
Gravy, boiled together with fuch Seafoning as 
you approve i the Sauce fhouldbe thicken dor 
brown'd, and it is fit for the Table. 

To farce Fowls another way. From the 

fa^ne, 

^'^ Ake Pullets and roaft them, then take the 
-^ Flcih of the Breaft, and mince it fmally 
with fome Fat of Bacon boil'd, a few Mufh- 
room^, a little Onion and Parfley, and fome 
Crumb of Bread foak'd in Cream over a gentle 
Fire 5 when ail thefe are well minc'd, add the 
Yolks of two or three Eggs> and mix all toge- 
ther i then with this forced ivieat fill the Breaft 
of the Fowls in' their proper fhape, and beac 
fome Whites of Eggs to go over them, and 
then cover them thick with Crumbs of Bread, 
having firfl laid your Fowls commodioufly in a 
Difh, and then put them in the Oven till they 
have taken a fine brown Colour^ If you have 

C % mor^ 



24 The Country Lady's 

more of this farced Meat than you ufc ir ma-^ 
king good the Fowls, either make it into ^3i\\s 
and fry them, or elfe make a Batter of Eggs, 
Milk, and Wheat-Flower, and dip fma II par- 
cels of the Farce into it to fry for garnifhing. 
You may make a Sauce to thefe farced Fowls 
with ftew'd Mufiirooms tofs'd up with Cream; 
the fame may be done with Turkeys, Phea- 
fants, (ire. 

To make a brown or white Fricajfee of Chic- 
kens. From the fame, 

C* Trip the Chickens of their Skins as foon as 
^ they are kiird, and when they are drawn, 
cut their Wings, Legs, and moft flefhy parts in 
Pieces, then fry them a little in HogVLard \ 
after which, put them to (lew with a little But- 
ter and Gravy, for a brown Fricaffec, or Butter 
and Water for a white Fricaffee ; to either 
of thefe add a Glafs of White Wine, with a 
Seafoning 6f Salt, Pepper, Nutmeg, Cherville 
cut fmqll, and three or four young Onions 
whole, that they may be withdrawn when the 
Pricaflce is enough : Then brown the Sauce 
with fome of the fame Lard the Chickens 
were firy'd in, and thicken it with burnt Flow- 
er i to this you may add fry'd or flew'd Mufli- 
rooms. But for ^ white Fricaffee, inftead of 
the browning with the Lard and burnt Flower, 
thicken the Sauceswith three or four Yolks of 
Eggs, and a little Verjuice 5 or elfe when the 
Fricaffee is ftev/d enough, take off the Fat as 
much as poffible, and tofs it up with Creamy 
this will ferve to fricaffee Rabbits. In

In Lent, and onFaft-days, I have eaten very 
good Soups abroad, that were made without 
lany Flelh, And as chat is not v.ery common 
in England, I thought it convenient to bring 
over the Receipts with me, that we mgy know 
how to make the beft of every thing about a 
Farm. 

To make Fifh-Gravj for Soups. 

'T^P make this Fifh-Gravy, which may ferve 
-*- for a Foundation of all jFifh-.Soups, take 
Tench or Eels, or both, well fcour'd from 
Mud, and their Outfides fcour'd well with Salt i 
then pull out their Gills, and put them in a Ket- 
tle with Water, Salt, a bunch of fweet Herbs, 
and an Onion ftuck with CloVes 5 boil jthefe 
an hour and a half, and then ftrain off the Li- 
quor thro' a Cloth : add to this the Peelings of 
JViufhroomswellwafh'd, or Mufhrooms them- 
felves cut fmall ; boil thefe together, and ftrain 
the Liquor thro' a Sieve into a Stew-Pan, upon 
fome burnt or fry'd Flower, and a little Lemon, 
which will foon render it of a good Colour, 
and delicate Flavour, fit for Soups, which rnay 
be varied according to the Palate, by putting 
in Pot-Herbs and Spices to every one's liking 5 
this will keep good fome time. When you 
make any of this into Soup, remember to put 
a Glafs of white Wine in^o your Soup a little 
pcfore you ferve it.

A Foundation for Herb Soups. 
^T^Ake a quantity of good Herbs, fuch ^ 
-*- Chcrvillc, Spinagc, Sallery, Leeks, Beet- 
Cards, and fuch like, with two or three laree 
Crufts of Bread, fome Butter, a bunch of fwect 
Herbs, and a little Salt 3 put thefe, with a mo- 
derate quantity of Water, into a Kettle, and 
boil them an hour and half, and ftrain off the 
Liquor thro' a Sieve, and it will be a good Poun- 
dation for Soups, either of Afparagus "^vAs, 
Lettuce, or any other kind, fit for Lent or Faft- 
days. Thefe Herb Soups are fometimes 
ftrengthened with two or three Yolks of Eggs, 
a little before they are (erv'd to the Table. 

As in this Month there is plenty of Oranges, 
fo it is a proper Seafon to make Orange- Wine, 
"whichis a moil pleafant and refrelhing Liquor 
in the Summer Sea Ion. The following Re- 
ceipt is an approved one for it. 

To make Orange Wine. From Mrs. E. B. 

TAke twenty Gallons of Water, and forty 
Pounds of ^nc Sugar, mix thefe together, 
boll and clarify it with the Whites of Eggs: 
againft this is dene, have two hundred middling 
Oranges, pared fo thin that no White appear 
upon the Rinds j and as foon as the Syrup is 
taken off the Fire, put the Peels of five and 
twenty Oranges into it i and when the Liquor 
is quite cold, put in the Juice of the Oranges, 
with fome frefh Ale-Ycall fpread upon a warm 
Toafl of white Bread ; let this work two days, 

and 



D I R E G T O R. 27 

and then put it into the VclTd or Cask, ad- 
ding at the fame time, two Gallons of white 
jPz?r/^ Wine ; and then to every Gallon of Li- 
quor, add an Ounce of Syrup cf Citron, or 
Syrup of Lemon, and in two Months time it 
will be fit to bottle. 

In this Month it may not be unneceffary 
to obicrve that Oranges are declining, and 
wafte apace ; but they are commonly very 
cheap, and therefore fuch as have a great Call 
for Orange-peel, as Confcdioners, ^c, now 
buy them in quantities 5 but a little Carriage 
by Land will contribute to their quicker de- 
cay. The Orange, tho' it is not found in 
every Garden, yet I cftecm it as a necelTary 
Truitinmany Cafes, and what a Family can 
hardly be without, and truly confidering how 
good Oranges we might have in our Gardens, 
and how eafily they may be cultivated againft 
Garden^valls, I much wonder that they are 
not more generally planted with us. There 
is a very good Inftance of their profpering 
well againft a Wall, and thriving in the na- 
tural Ground, at Mr. Heathers^ a curious 
Gentleman at Twittenhamy which Trees bear 
very well, and bring very large Fruit. 

But as I have obferv'd above, that this is 
the Seafon v/hen foreign Oranges are gene- 
rally in the greateft plenty about London, it 
is a good time to preferve their Juicie 5 efpe- 
cially it may prove ufeful to fuch as have op- 
portunities of vending Tmch in large Quan- 

C 4 titles.

titles, or for fuch who find that Liquor agrce- 
sbletothem : For tho' I have known feveral 
who have exprefs'd the Juice of Oranges and 
Lemons, and bottled it up againft a dear 
Time, yet fuch Juice has turned to be of a 
very difagrccable Sournefs in a fhor&ftafon. 
The Method which I have taken to^ prefervc 
this Juice to be ufed in Punch, was tp cxprefs 
the Juice, and pafs it thro' a Jelly^ag, with 
about two Ounces of double-refined yLoaf- 
Sugar to each Pint of Juice, and a Pint of Bran- 
dy, or Arrack ; bottle this up, and cork it 
well with found Corks, and you may keep it 
a Year. Before you pafs this Liquor thro' / 
the Bag, you may put about the Rind of two 
Oranges to ftcep for two Hours, into each 
Qiiart of Liquor, which will give it a rich 
Flavour. When you have occafion to ufe it 
for Punch, it is at the difcretion of the Maker 
TO add what quantity of Brandy, or Arrack, 
he thinks proper, only remembring that there 
is already a Pint in each Bottle. This may 
be of good advantage to Inn-keepers, &c. 
who live remote from London ; and by this 
way they need not run the hazard of lofing 
this fort of Fruit, by bruifing or rotting, which 
they will be fubjcd to, if they are not well 
packed, and have bad Roads, And befides, 
confidering the vaft difference that there is in 
the Price of Oranges, fo much, that at fome 
Seafonsrvou muft pay as much for one, as 
will at another time purchafe near a Dozen, 
it is the belt to confider of this when they are

at the cheapeft Price. We may likewife ufe 
the fame Method with Lemons i but it is not 
convenient to fteep any of the Peels in the 
Liquor, for they will giye it a difagreeable 
Plavour.. But it is to be underftood alfo, that 
Lemons are to be met with in perfeftion all 
the Year j only this Seafon they are at the 
cheapeft Price. The Peel of an Orange or 
two may be put to each Quart of Juice, to fteep 
as above direfted, bruifing every piece of Peel 
as you put it into the Juice. Note, that the 
Lemon and Qrange Juice muft not be mix'd 
\together in the fame Bottles.

HIS Month all forts of Pond-fifli are iu 
Seafon 5 ^uiz. the Jack, the Carp, the 
Tench, the Perch, and the Eel 5 but it 
muft be noted, that both the Males and 
Pemalesof every kind of Fifh are in their greateft 
Perfedion before the Spawning-time, and they 
are fick and unwholefome for three Weeks 
after Spawning. The Eel, indeed, has not yet 
been known to lay any Spawn, but is likely 
^to be Viviparous, as I have mention d in the 
Month oi January, The Jack, or Pike, this 

Month 



so The Gountry Lad/s 

Month runs, as the Sportfmen call k; that 
is^ they retire into the Ditches, if there arc 
any in their way, and feed upon Frogs j or 
elfc, in warm Days, lie upon the top of the 
Waters, and arc eafily taken by Snares : How- 
ever, they are this Month full row'd, and are 
then in their grcateft Strength, and in the beft 
condition for the Table, We judge thofe are 
the bell which are broad-back'd, and deep Fifh 5 
for thofe that are long and {lender, have not 
their Plefh firm, which is reckoned the Perfec- 
tion of a Fifh. T^e way of preparing this 
Fifh in the beft manner, in my Opinion, if 
it is large, is to roaft it according to the fol- 
lowing Pvcceipt, Vv^hich I had from Mr. John 
Hughs, an excellent Cook in London, 

HEN a Jack or Pike is difcharged of its 
Scales and Entrails, and well cleand, 
prepare a Mixture in the following Manner, 
to be few'd up in the Belly of the Fifh : 
Take of grated Bread about one third part, the 
Rivet, or Liver of the Fifh cut fmall, with Oy- 
fters chopp'd, or the Flcfn of Eels cut fmall 5 
mix theie with three or four Eggs butter'd 
in a Sauce-pan, to which add Pepper and 
Salt with fome dry'd Sweet Marjoram well 
poudcr'd, or fuch other Svvect-hcrbs as are 
moft grateful to the Palate, an Anchovy fhred 
fmalC and fill the Belly of the FiQi with the 
Preparation, and few it up. When this is done, 
cut two fmall Laths of Willow, or any other 
Wood, except Deal, or fuch as has a Tur- 




Director. 3T 

pentine Juice in it^ of the length of the Fifli, 
and lay the Pirn upon the Spit, with the two 
Laths upon the Fi(h, and bind them together 
with a Fillet of Linnen, about an Inch wide, 
which muft be wrapped round them in a Screw- 
like manner, and then laid down to the Fire, 
and bafted very well with Butter, and drudged 
with Crumbs of Bread, and the fame fort of 
Sweet-herbs that were ufed in the Mixture 
abovemention'd. Where you have not the 
conveniency of Oyfters, or Eels, to compofe 
the aforementioned Mixture, you may add a 
larger quantity of buttefd Eggs. Where there 
is the conveniency of an Oven, we may bake 
fuch a Fifli with lefs trouble than roafting it ; 
and in that cafe rub the outfide with the Yolk 
of an Egg, and roll it in fome of the Mix- 
ture abovemention'd, the Anchovy and buttcr'd 
Eggs excepted, putting fome Vinegar and Bar- 
ter in thePan. The Sauce to this Fifnis Bat- 
ter melted, alittle White-wine, and mix'dwith 
a third part of feafond Beef Gravy, v/ith a 
Spoonful or two of Mufhroom Ketchup, and 
an Anchovy or two difiblved. 

The fmaller Sort of thefe Fifh, i. e, fuch as 
are about a Foot long, are mofl: commonly 
boiled, but they will do well baked, as above 
direded. The fame Sauce may be ufed with 
the boird Fifh 5 or inftead of Beef Grnvy, 
may be ufed the Mufhroom Gravy, as diredcd 
in this Work, which will have a much liner 
Relifn than the Beef Gravy,

In this Month likewife, the Carp is fit for tha 
Tabic, and is commonly much admir'd, if. it 
be well ftew'd 5 othervvife I think it makes but 
an inditferent Difh, being a Fifh full of Crpfs- 
bones. The Head is accounted much the b^ft 
part of the Pifh, and is therefore prefcntcd as 
a Compliment to the greateft Stranger at the 
Table. The Carp, as it is a Filli which 
thrives bed in black, deep, {landing Waters, 
is therefore commonly given to tafle of the 
Mud y but to cure this, thofe Carps you in- 
tend for the Table fhould be put into a clear 
Water for a Week before you ufe them, that 
they may purge themfelves. You may keep 
two Brace of large Carps well enough in 4 
two-dozen Hamper, plung'd into any part of 

River where there is a cle^r Stream, or 
Trench that is fed by z Spring, and they will 
bei?ome of an extraordinary iweetTafte. And 
fe we may do with Tench and Eels, when 
we catch them in foui feeding Waters. When 
your Fifh are thus purify 'd, drefs your Carps 
after the following manner : 

To Stew Carps or Tench. 

TAke a Brace of live Carp, fcale them, 
gut and wafh them, and bleed them ia 
the Tails, fo that the Blood be not loft \ for 
according to all the Receipts for ftewing this 
kind of FiQi, the Blood, however fmall the 
Quantity is of it, muft make part of the Sauce : 
Lay thefe in a Stew-Pan with the Blood, a 
Pint of Beef-Gravy, a Pint of Claret, a large 

Onion 



Director. 33' 

Onion ftuck v/ith CioYts, three large Ancho- 
vies, a Stick of Korrc-radirn fliced, the Peel 
of half a large Lemon, Pepper and Salt at 
plcaiiire, a Bunch of Sweet-herbs, two or 
three Spoonfuls of Vinegar. This Liqaor 
fliould nearly cover the Carps 5 fo that if the 
Gravy and Claret, mentiond above, be not 
fuiiicient, add equal quantities of each till you 
have enough 5 cover this clofe, and fet the 
Stew-pan over a gentle Fire, till the lower- 
lide of the Fiili are ftew^d enough ; then turn 
them, and keep them ftewing as before, clofe 
covered, till they are enough 5 after which, 
lay them in a DiQi upon Sippets of fry'd 
Bread, and drain off the Sauce to be th^ken d 
and brown'd with burnt Butter. This muft 
be poured over the Fidi, and the Difli gai« 
nifh'd with the Row or Milt, Barberries, and 
Lemons fliced. 

The fame Method is alio ufcd for ftewing 
of large Roach, Dace, ^d Chubb 5 but a 
Tench ftew'd this way, is much better than 
a Carp. The Back of this Pifli, and the Hcad^ 
are the Pieces which are moil in efteem. 

It is worth our remark, that when we find 
our Tench covered with black Scales, they 
will always tafte muddy, v/hich is the fault 
of the River-Tench about Cambridge-^ but 
where we find Tench of a soldcn Colour, 
we are furc of good Fiili, that^ will eat fweet 
without the trouble of putting 'em into clear 
Water to purify. 

As

As there is fomc trouble in the drcfilngof 
this Fiin, they may be flew'd the Night be- 
fore they are to be eaten, and will keep very 
welli and half, an hour before they are to be 
ferv'd up, fet them over the Fire to be 
thoroughly hot, and then brown their Sauce 
as b:fore dired:ed. 

It is to be obferv'd, that to bake thefe lifh 
with the above Ingredients, is as good a Way 
as the dewing them. It is likewife neeefTary 
to obfervc, that all Fifh which will keep a long 
time alive out of Water, will ficken, and 
their Flefh become unfirm by lying in the 
Air 5 therefore, if fifh are to be fent a Day's 
Tourn(^, or kept a Day before they are ufed, 
kill tf^em as foon as they are taken out of 
the Water, and the Fkfn will be firm. 

I iliall add one thing more concerning the 
boiling of Fifh, which was communicated to 
me by a very ingenious Gentleman, who has 
made Fifhing his Study for many Years : He; 
fays, that the Goodnefs of boil'd Fifh confifts 
chiefly in the Firmnefs of the Flefh i and in the 
next place, that the Flefh parts eafily from the 
Bonej to do which, he direds to kill the 
Fiih immediately after they are taken out of 
the Water 5 and when you defign to boil 'em, 
put a large handful of Salt into about two or 
three quarts of Water, and lb in proportion : 
Put in the Fifh v/hile the Water is cold 5 then 
fet them over the Fire, and make them boil 
as quick as pofTible, without any Cover over 
the Pan. This is approved to do very welL

This Receipt is particularly good for boiling 
of Flounders. His Receipt for Sauce for 
boil'd Pifh, is the following.

boil them well together, and ftrain off the 
Liquor, then put a Spoonful of Muihroom 
Ketchup to it, and thicken it with Butter 
mix'd with Flower : or for Faft-days the Gravy 
may be omitted, and in the place of it put 
Mufnroom-Gravy, or a larger quantity o£ 
Mufhroom-Ketchup, or fome of the Fiih- 
Gravy mentioa'd in February ^ which is good 
to put in Sauce for any fort ofFifn.

for the Dreffi ng of them in the bed manner : 
Thefirft for Roafting of Eels, or Pitchcotting 
them, I had from the Crown at Bajingfioke 
fome Years ago , and that for Collaring of 
Eels, from Mr. John Hughs, a celebrated 
Cook in London, But I Ihall firft obfervc, 
that the Silver Eel is counted the beftj and 
that all fuch as lie and feed in clear Streams, 
may be uied without purging them, as I have 
direded above j but all Pond Eels muft be 
put into clear Waters for a Week, at lead, 
before they are ufed, if you would have them 
in perfcdion. And now to the Receipts.

About the end of this Month, the Trout be* 
gins to come in Seafon j for before this time, 
its Body is covered with little Infects, which is 
a Demonftration of its being fick and unwhole- 
fome. The beft way of eating this Fifh is to 
boil it, and ferve it with Butter and an Ancho- 
vy for Sauce 5 as is commonly pradis'd about 
Hunger ford J Spenham-Land^ and other noted 
Places for Trout. 

If the Seafon is now mild, about the end of 
the Month the Sap in the Birch-Tree will begin 
to be very fluent. And fo in the Choice of 
Fifh to be feafonable, we muft have regard to 
the Temper of the Air ; for if the Air be mild 
and gentle, fooner or later all parts of the 
Creation are governed by it : but when Idireft 
for this Month Or another any thing to be done, 
I fuppofe the Temper of the Air to be what it 
is for the generality 5 but the Birch-Tree Sap 
we will fuppofe begins now to flow, and then 
We are to take the opportunity of making 
Wine of it. The befl: Receipt I have met with 
ibr making this Wine, is the following. 

To 




Director. 19 

To make Birch-Wine, From Lady W. 

Hen the Sap of the Birch-Tree will run, 
cut a large Notch in the Bark of the 
Trunk of the Tree, in fuch a place as one may 
conveniently place a VciTel to receive the Sap 5 
which will flow at the Incifion very plentifully, 
without doing any harm to the Tree, If the 
Trees are pretty large, you may exf^eSt about 
a Gallon of Liquor from each of them, which 
muft be ordered in the following manner. 
Take five Gallons of the Liquor, to which put 
five Pounds of Powder-Suear, and two Pounds 
of Raifins of the Sun ftoned 5 to this, put the 
Peel of one large Lemon, and about forty large; 
frefh Cloves : boil all thefe together, taking 
off the Scum carefully asitrifes ; then pour it 
off into fome Veflel to cool, and as foon as it 
is cool enough to put Yeaft to it, work it as you 
would do Ale for two days, and then tunn it, 
taking care not to flop the Veffel till it has done 
Working, and in a Month's time it will be 
ready to bottle. This is not only a very Plea- 
fant, but a Very Wholefome Wine. 

This Month is efl:eemed one of the principal 
Seafons for brewing of Malt Liquors for long 
keeping 5 the FvCaion is, becaufe the Air at this 
time of the Year is temperate, and contri- 
butes to the good Working or Fermenting the 
Drink) which chiefly promotes its Preferva^ 
tion and good Keeping : for very cold Wea* 
ther prevents the free Fermentation or Work- 
ing of Liquors, as Well us very hot Weather j 

D 2 fo 



40 The Country Ladfs 

fothat if we brew in veiy cold Weather, un^ 
kfs wc ufe feme Means to warm the Cellar 
while new Drhik is Working, it will never 
clear itlelf as it ought to do 5 and the fame 
Misfortune will it lie under, if in very hot 
Weather the Cellar is not put in a temperate 
ftate, the Confequcnce of which will be, that 
fuch Drink will be Muddy and Sour, and, per- 
haps, never recover i or if it docs, perhaps not 
under two or three Years, Again, fuch A4if- 
fortunes are often owing to the badnefs of 
the Cellars 5 for where they are dug in fpringy 
Ground, or are fubjcdt to Wet in the Winter;, 
then the Drink will chill, and grow flat and 
dead. But where Cellars are of this fort, it is 
advifeable to make your great Brewings in this 
Month rather than in October y for you may 
keep fuch Cellars temperate in Summer,butcan- 
not warm them in Winter, and fo your Drink 
brew'd in March will have due time to fettle 
and adjuft itielf before the Cold can do it any 
great harm. It is advifeable likewife to build 
your Cellars for keeping of Drink, after fuch 
a manner, that none of the external Air may 
come into them ; for the variation of the Air 
abroad, was there free admiffion of it into the 
Cellars, would caufe as many Alterations in 
the Liquors, and fo would keep them per- 
petuall) diftuub'd and unfit for drinking. I 
know fome curious Gentlemen in thefe things, 
that keep double Doors to their Cellars, on 
purpofe that none of the outward Air may get 
into them, and they have good rcafon to boaft 

' ■ ' ■- ■ -of 



Director. 41 

of their Malt- Liquors. The meaning of the 
double DoorS;, is to keep one fhut whik the 
other is open, that the outward Air may be ex- 
chjded ; luch Cellars, if they lie dry, as they 
ought to do, arc faid to be cool in Summer, 
and warm in Winter, tho' in realiry, they are 
conftantly the iarne in point of Temper : they 
Teem indeed cool in hot Weather, but that is 
becaufe we come into them from an hotter 
abroad; and fothey feem to us warm in Winter/ 
becaufe we come out of a colder Air to them 5 
fo that they are only cold or warm compara- 
tively, as the Air \vc come out of is hotter or 
colder. This is the Cafe, and a Cellar fhould 
be thus difpos'd if we expect to have good 
Drink, As for the Brewing Part itfelf, 1 fhall 
leave that to the Brewers in the fcveral Coun- 
ties in England ^ Vv ho have mod: of them dif- 
ferent Manners even of Brewing honeftiy. 
What I (hall chiefly touch upon, befides what 
I fhall fpeakof Cellaring, will relate to Water, 
Malr, Hops, and the keeping Liquors. 

The bed: Water, to fpeak in general, is Ri- 
ver W^ater, fuch as is foft, and has partook 
of the Air and Sun j for this eafily infinuates 
itfelf into the Malt, and extracts its Virtue i 
whereas the hard Waters aftring^e and bind the 
Parts of the Malt, fo that its Virtue is not 
freely communicated to the Liquor. It is a 
Rule with a Friend of mine, that all Water 
which will mix with Soap is fit for Brewing, 
and he will by no means allow of any other 5 
and 1 have more than once experienc'd, that 

D 3 where 



4^ The Country Lady's 

where the fame QLianrity of Malt has been ufcd 
to a Barrel of River Water, and the fame to 
a Barrel of Spring Water, the River Watey 
Brewin2; has excelled the other in Strens^th above 
five degrees in twelve Months, as I proved by 
a fmali Giafs-Tube with a Seal, and was 
much preferable to the Taftc. I mud obfcrvc 
too, that the Malt was not only in Quantity 
the fame for one Barrel as for another, but was 
the fame in Qnaliry, having been all mcafur'd 
from the fame Heap; fo alfo the Hops were 
the fame both in Quality and Quantity, and the 
Time of boiling, and both worked in the fame 
■jmanner, and tunn'd and kept in the fame Cel- 
lar. Here it was plain that there was no dif- 
ference but the Water, and yet one Barrel was 
worth two of the other. 

There is one thing which has long puzzled 
the beft Brewers, which I iliall here endeavour 
to explain i and that is,where fcveral Genclemen 
in the fame Town have cmploy'd the fame 
Brewer, have had the fame Malt, the fame 
Hops, and the fame ¥/atcr too, and brew'd 
all in the fame Month, and broaclfd their 
Drink at the fame time 5 and yet one has had 
Beer which has been extrem^ely fine, ftrong, 
and well rafted, while the others have hardly 
had any worth drinking, I conjecture there 
may be three Reafons for this difference : One 
may be the different Weather which might 
happen at the different Brewings in this Month, 
which might make an Alteration in the Work- 
ing of the Liquors: Or, fecondly, that the 

Yeaft 



Director. 43. 

Yeaft or Barm might be of different forts, or iii 
diiFerent ftatcs, wiierewith thefe Liquors were 
work'd : And, thirdly, that the Cellars were 
not equally good: for I am Very fenfible, the 
goodnefs of fuch Drink, as is brew'd for keep- 
ing, depends upon the goodnefs of the Cellars 
where it is kept ; for at a Gentleman's of my 
Acquaintance, who for many Years has ufed 
the fame Brewer, and the fame Method, his Beer 
is always of the fame Tafte, his Cellars, or 
Vaults, are very dry, and have two or three 
Doors to them. 

The "Dorchefter Beer, which is efteem'd pre- 
ferable to moft of the Malt-Liquor in Englandy 
is for the moft part brew'd of chalky Water, 
which is almoft every where in that County 5 
and as the Soil is generally Chalk there, I am of 
opinion, that the Cellars being dug in that dry 
Soil contributes to the good keeping of their 
Drink, it being of aclofe texture, and of a dry- 
ing quality, fo as to diflipate Damps ; for damp 
Cellars, we find by experience, are injurious to 
keeping Liquors, as well as deftrudive to the 
Casks. The Malt of this Country is of a pale 
Colour 5 and the beft Drink of this County that 
I have met with to be fold, is at a fmall Houfe 
againft the (Jim^nQh^iBlacki^ater, four Miles 
beyond T>orchefier, m the Road to Bridport^ 
mT)orfetjhire:, they broach no Beer till it is 
a Year old, and has had time to mellow. But 
there rnuft be fuch Cellars as I fpeak of, which 
inclofe a temperate Air, to ripen Drink in 5 the 
conftant temperate Air digefts and foftcns thefe 

D 4. Malt 



44- T'loe Country Ladfs 

Malt Liquors, fo that they drink fmooth as 
Oil; but in the Cellars which are unequal, by 
letting in Heats and Colds, the Drink is iubjed 
to grow ftalc and fharp : For this reafon it is, 
that Drink, which is brcw'd for a long Voyage 
at Sea, Hiould beperfcdly ripe and fine before 
it is exported, for when it has bad fufiicient 
time todigeft in the Cask, and is rack'd from 
theBottomor Lcc,, it will bear carriage with- 
out inju.v It is farther to be noted, that in 
proportion to the quantity of Liquor, which is 
cnclofcd in one Cask, fo will it be a longer or 
a fhorter time m ripening. A Veffei which 
will contain two Hoafheads of Beer, will re- 
quire twice as much time to perfect itfelf as one 
of a Hogfliead 5 and from my experience Hind 
there fhould be no Vefle] ufed for ftrong Beer, 
which we dcfign to keep, lefs than a Hogfhead : 
for one of that quantity, if it be fit to draw 
in a Year, has Body enough to fupport it two, 
or three, or four Years, if it has ftrength of 
Malt and Hops in it, as the "Dorfetfhire Beer 
has; and this will bear the Sea very well, as 
we find every day. 

There is one thin^ more to be confider'd in 
the prcfervation of Beer; and that is, when 
once the Veflel is broached, wc ought to have 
regard to the time in which it will be expended : 
for if there happens to be a quick Draught for 
it, then it will iait good to the very bottom ; 
but if there islikeiy to be a flow draught, then 
do not draw off quire half, before you bottle 
it» or elfc your Beer will grow flat, dead, or 

four.

four. This is obferved very much among the 
Curious. • 

One great piece of Oeconomy is the good 
management of Small Beer i for if that is not 
good, the Drinicers of it will be feeble in Sum- 
mer-time, and incapable of ftrong Work, and 
will be very fubjed to Didempers 5 and befidcs, 
when Drink is not good, a great deal will be 
thrown away. The ufe of Drink, as well as 
Meat, is to nourilh the Body j and the more La- 
bour there is upon any one, the more fubftan- 
rial fhould be the Dyct. In the time of Harvcft 
I have often feen the bad EfFcds of bad Small 
Beer among the Workmen 5 and in great Fa- 
milies, where that Article has not been taken 
care of, the Apothecaries Bills have amounted 
to twice as much more as the Malt would have 
come to, that would have kept the Servants in 
ftrength and good health ; befides one thing 
more, which I obferved above, good whole- 
fome Drink is fcldom flung away by Servants, 
fo that thefparing of a little Malt ends in lois 
to the Matter. Where there is good Ccllarinii, 
therefore, it is advifeable to brew a flock of 
Small Beer, cither in this Month or OEiober^ 
or in both Months, and to be kept in Hogfhcads, 
if poffible : The Beer brew'd m March to be- 
gin drawing in OBober, and that brew'd in 
O^ober to begin in March^ for Summer 
drinking i having this regard to the quantity, 
that a Family of the fame number of working 
Perfons, will drink a third more in Summer 
than in Winter. 

If 



4^ The Country Ladfs 

If Water happens to be of a hard nature, it 
may be foftened by fetting it expofcd to the 
Air and Sun, and putting into it fome Pieces 
of foft Chalk to infufe 5 or elfe when the Wa- 
ter is fct on to boil, for pouring upon the Malt, 
put into it a quantity of Bran, which will help 
a little to foften it. 

Ifliall now mention two or three Particulars 
relating to Malt, which may help thofe who 
are unacquainted with brewing : In the firft 
place, the general Diftindions, between one 
Malt and another, is only that one is high 
dried, the other low dried y that which we call 
high dried, will, by brewing, produce a Liquor 
of a brown, deep Colour 5 and the other, which 
is the low dried, will give us a Liquor of a pale 
Colour. The firft is dried in fuch a manner, 
as may be faid rather to be fcorch'd than dried, 
and will promote the Gravel and Stone, and is 
much lefs nouriftiing than the low dried, or 
pale Malt, as they call it j for all Corn in the 
moft fimpie way is the moft feeding to the Bo- 
dy. I have experienced too, that the brown 
Malt, even tho' it be well brewed, will foon- 
cr turn fharp than the pale Malt, if that be fair- 
ly brewed. I am told, that a Gentleman in 
Northamptonfhire has dried Malt upon the 
Leads of a Houfe, and has made very good 
Drink of it: And the Methodof drying Malt 
by hot Air, which was once propofed to the 
Publick, will do very well for a fmall quanti- 
ty, but 'tis much too tedious to be ever render- 
ed profitable i however, any means that can 

I be 



Director.' 47 

be ufedto dry Malt without parching of it, will 
certainly contribute to the goodnefs of the 
Malt. At the Greyhound at Marlborough I 
have drank of the paleft-colour'd Ale I ever 
faw, and the beft tafted, and the ftrongcft that 
I have met with. In that place they dry their 
Malt very tenderly, and brew with chalky 
Water, and their Cellars are dug in Chalk : 
So at the Crown at Hockrellx\Q:zx. Bijhop-Star- 
ford in Hertfordjhirey is excellent Beer of a 
pale Colour, ftrong, and well tafted j there the 
Malt is tenderly dried and the Soil chalky : like^ 
wife at Nottingham and T>erby they brew with 
pale Malt, chalky Water, and their Cellars are 
dug in Chalk. 

Thefe Places are noted for the Goodnefs 
of their Ale all over England, infomuch that 
it has been computed, that there has been a- 
bove two Hundred Thoufand Pounds worth 
of Ale fold in and about London-, under the 
Denomination of Nottingham, T^erby, "Dor- 
chefter, &c. in one Year s time : but it is nor 
in London that we muft exped to tafte thefc 
Liquors in perfedion 5 for it is rare to find 
any of them there without being adulrera- 
ted, or elfe fuch Liquors arc fold for them 
as arc unskilful Imitations of them j and I 
may add, are unwholefome into the bargain. 
While I am writing this, a Gentleman of 
good Judgment in this Affair informs me, 
that the Brown Malt he finds makes the beft 
Drink, when it is brew'd with a coarfe River 
Water, foch as that of the River Thames a- 

bout 



48 The Country Ladfs 

bout London } and that likewife being brevv'd 
with fuch Water, it makes very good Ale : 
but that it will not keep above fix Months, 
without turning ftale, and a little fharp, even 
tho* he allows fourteen Bufliels to the Hoc^f- 
head. He adds, that he has try *d the high- 
dry 'd Malt to brew Beer with for keeping, 
and hopp'd it accordingly 5 and yet he could 
never brew it fo as to drink foft and mel- 
low, like that brew'd with Pale Malt. There 
is an acid Quality in the high-dry 'd Malt, 
which occafions that Diftemper commonlv 
called the Heart-burn, in thofc that drink of 
the Ale or Beer made of it. When I men- 
tion Malt, in what I have already faid above, 
I mean only Malt made of Barley ; for Wheat- 
malt^ Pea- malt, or thefe mix'd with Barley- 
malt, tho' they produce a high- coloured Li- 
quor, will keep many Years, and drink foft 
and fmooth ; but then they have the Mum- 
Plavour. I have known fomc People, who 
ufed brewing with high dry'd Barley-malr, to 
put a Bag, containing about three Pints of 
Wheat, into every Hogfhead of Drink, and 
that has fined it, and made it to drink mel- 
Jow: others I have feen put about three Pints 
of Wheat-malt into a Hogfhead, which has 
produced the fame Effcd. But all Malt-Li- 
quors, however they may be well-brew'd, 
may be fpoiled by bad Cellaring, and be now 
and then fubjed to ferment in the Cask, and 
confequently turn thick and four. The beft 
way to help this, and bring the Drink to it 

felf. 



Director. 49 

felf, is to open the Bung of the Cask for 
two or three Days, and if that does not ftop 
the Fermentation, then put about two or 
three Pounds of Oyfter-fliells wafli'd and dry'd 
well in an Oven, and then beaten to fine Pou- 
der, and ftirring it a little, it will prefently 
fettle the Drink, make it fine, and take off 
the fharp Tafte of it j and as foon as that is 
done, draw it off into another Veffel, and 
put a fmall Bag of Wheat or Wheat-malt 
into it, as above direfted, or in proportion^ 
as the Veffel is larger or fmaller. 

Sometimes fuch Fermentations will happen 
in Drink, by change of Weather, if it is in 
a bad Cellar, and it will in a few Months 
fall fine of it fclf, and srow mellow. 

It is remarkable, that high-dry'd Malt fhould 
not be ufed in Brewing till it has been ground 
ten Days, or a Fortnight, it yields much ftronger 
Drink than the fame quantity of Malt frelli 
ground i but ifyou defign to keep Malt fome 
time ground before you ufe it, you muft take 
care to keep it very dry, and the Air at that 
time fhould Jikewife be dry. And as for Pale 
Malt, which has not partaken fo much of the 
Fire, it muft not remain ground above a Week 
before you ufe it. 

As for Hops, the neweft are much the beft, 
tho' . they will rei^iain very good two Years 5 
but after that, ^ey begin to decay, and iofe 
their good^avour unlefs great Quantities have 
been kept together ; for in that cafe they 
will keep much longer good than in fmall 

Quan- 



50 The Country Ladfs 

Quantities. Thefe, for tlieir better preferva- 
tion, (hould be kept in a very dry Place^ 
the' the Dealers in them rather chufc fuch 
Places as arc moderately between moid and 
dry, that they may not lofe of their Weight. 
I cannot help taking notice here of a Method 
which was ufed to fome ftaie and decay 'd 
Hops the laft Year 1725, to make them re- 
cover their Bitternefs 5 which was to unbag 
them^ and fprinkle them with Aloes and Wa- 
ter, which, together with the badnefs of the 
Malt of the fame Year's growth, fpoil'd great 
quantities of Drink about London j for even 
where the Water, the Malt, and the Brewer^ 
and Cellars are good, a bad Hop will fpoil 
all : So that every one of thefe Particu- 
lars (hould be well-chofen before the Brew- 
ing is kt about, or elfe we muft expeft but 
a bad Account of our Labour. And fo like- 
wife the Yeaft or Barm that you work your 
Drink with, muft be well confider'd, or a good 
Brewing may be fpoifd by that alone i and 
be fure that be always provided before you 
begin Brewing, for your Wore will not ftay 
for it. 

In fome remote Places from Tovvns it is 
praftifed to dip Whisks into Yeaft, and 
beat it well, and fo hang up the Whisks with 
the Yeaft in them to dry; and if there is no 
Brewing till two Months afterwards, the 
beating and ftirring one of thefe Whisks in 
New Wort, will raife a Working or Fermen- 
tation in it. It is a Rule that all Drink (hould 
-*. " be 



Director. 51 

be work'd well in the Tun, or Keel, before 
it be put in the Veffel, for elfe it will not ca- 
fily grow fine. Some follow the Rule of 
beating down the Yeaft pretty often while it 
is in the Tun, and keep it there working for 
two or three Days, obferving to put it in the 
Veffel juft when the Yeaft begins to fall. This 
Drink is commonly very fine 5 whereas that, 
which is put into the Veffel quickly after 'tis 
brew'd, will not be fine in many Months. 

We may yet obferve, that with relation 
to the Seafon for brewing of Drink for keep- 
ing, if the Cellars are fubjed to the Heat of 
the Sun, or warm Summer Air, it is bcft to 
brew in OBober-, that the Drink may have 
time to digeft before the warm Seafen comes 
on : And if Cellars are inclinable to Damps, 
and to receive Water, the bcft time is to brev/ 
in March s. and I know fome experienced 
Brewers, who always chufe the brewing of 
Pale Malt in Marchy and the Brown in 0£io~ 
ber 5 for they guefs that the Pale Malt, being 
made with a leffer degree of Fire than the 
other, wants the Summer-Seafon to ripen in 5 
and fo on the contrary, the Brown having had 
a larger fhare of the Fire to dry it, is more ca- 
pable of defending itfelfagainft the Cold of the 
Winter- Seafon. But how far thefe Reafons 
may be juft, I fhali not pretend to determine 5 
but in fuch a Work as this, nothing fhould 
be omitted that may contribute to give the 
icaft Hint towards meliorating fo valuable a 

Ma- 



5 2 Tke Country Ladfs 

Manufadure j the Artifts in the Brewing Way 
are at liberty to judge as they pleafe. 

But when we have been careful in all the 
above Particulars, if the Casks are not in good 
order, ftill the Brewing may be fpoii'd. New 
Casks are apt to give Drink an ill Tafte, if 
they are not well fcalded and fcafon'd fevcrai 
Days fucceflively, before they are put in ufe ; 
and for old Casks, if they ftand any time out 
of ufe, they are apt to grow mufty : unflack'd 
Lime, about a Gallon to a Hogfhcad, with a- 
bout fix Gallons of Water put in with it, and 
the Hogfhead prefently ftopp'd up, will clear it 
of its Taint, if the fame be repeated four or 
five times 5 or burning ofLinnen dipp'd in 
Brimftone, to be clofe flopped in a Cask, three 
or four times repeated, will do the fame : or elfe 
put Water in your Veflels, and throw in fome 
burning Coals, and flop them clofe, will do 
the like, if it be often repeated. 

I have now but little more to fay about 
the Management of Drink, and that is con- 
cerning the Bottling of it. The Bottles firll 
mufl be well clean d and dry'd 5 for wet Bot- 
tles will make the Drink turn mouldy, or mo- 
therry, as they call it 5 and by wet Bottles, 
many VefTels of good Drink are ipoiled: but 
if the Bottles are clean and dry, yet if the Corks 
are not new and found, the Drink is ftill li- 
able to be damaged 5 for if the Air can get 
into the Bottles, the Drink will grow flat, and 
will never rife. I have known many who 
have flattered themfelves that they knew how 

to 



Director. 51 

to be faving, and have ufed old Corks on this 
occafion, that have fpoilcd as much Liquor as 
has ftood them in four or five Pounds, only for 
want of laying out three or four ShiiUngs. If 
Bottles are cork'd as they fhould be, it is hard 
topuliout the Corks without a Screw, and to 
be fure to draw the Cork without breaking, 
the Screw ought to go through the Cork, and 
then the Air muft nccclTarily find a Paflage 
where the Screw has pafs'd, and therefore the 
Cork is good for nothing 5 or if a Cork has 
once been in a Bottle, and has been drawn 
without a Screw, yet that Cork will turn mufty 
as foon as it is expo fed to the Air, and will 
communicate its ill Flavour to the Bottle where 
if is next put, and fpoil the Drink that way. 

In the choice of Corks, chufe thofe that are 
foft, and clear from Specks, and lay them ia 
Water a day or two before you ufe them 5 but 
let them dry again before you put them in the 
Bottles, left the5^ fhould happen to turn mouldy : 
with this care you may make good Drink, and 
preferve it to anfwer your expedation. 

In the bottling of Drink, you may alfo ob- 
ferve, that the top and middle of the Hogfhead 
is the ftrongeft, and will fooner rife in the Bot- 
tles than the bottom : And when once you 
begin to bottle a Veffel of any Liquor, be fure 
not to leave it till all is complcated, for elfe 
you will have fome of one Tafte, and fome of 
another. 

If you find that a VefTel of Drink begins to 
gtow flat, whilft it is in common draught, bot- 



54 The Country Ladfs 

tie it, and into every Bottle put a piece of 
Loaf- Sugar, about the quantity of a Walnut, 
which will make the Drink rife and come to 
itfelf ; and to forward its ripening, you may 
fetfome Bottles in Hay in a warm Place; but 
Straw will not aflift its ripening. 

Where there are not good Cellars, I have 
known Holes funk in the Ground, and large 
Oil Jars put into them, and the Earth filled 
clofe about the fides : One of thefe Jars may 
hold about a dozen quart Bottles, and will keep 
the Drink very well i but the tops of the Jars 
muft be kept clofe covered up. And in Winter 
time, when the Weather is frofty, fhut up all 
the Lights or Windows into fuch Cellars, and 
cover them clofe with frefh Horfe-Dung, or 
Horfe- Litter 5 but 'tis much better to have no 
Lights or Windows at all to any Cellar, for 
the reafons I have given above. 

If there has been opportunity of brewing a 
good ftock of Small Beer m March and OBo- 
bery fome of it may be bottled at fix Months 
end, putting into every Bottle a lump of Loaf- 
Sugar as big as a Walnut i this efpecially will 
be very refrefhing Drink in the Summer : Or 
if you happen to brew in Summer, and are de- 
firous ot brisk Small Beer, bottle it, as above,, 
as loon as it has done working.

APRIL. 




ROM the beginning of this Month 
the Perch is in great Perfedion, and 
holds good till Winter. One of the 
ways of drefling this Fifh, according 
to the Hollanders y and which is much admired 
by Travellers, is after the following manner, 
and is called IVater-Soochy, 

To make a Water-Soochy. 

TAKE Perch about five Inches long, fcale 
and clean them well 5 then lay them in a 
Difh, and pour Vinegar upon them, and let 
them lie an Hour in it 5 after which put them 
into a Skellet with Water and Salt, fomcParf^ 
ley-Leaves and ParQey-Roots well wafh'd and 
fcraped : let thefe boil over a quick Fire till 
they are enough, and then pour the Fifh, Roots, 
and Water into a Soop-Dlfh, and ferve them up 
hot with a Garnifh about the Difli of Lemon 
iliccd. Thefe Fifh and Roots are commonly 
eaten with Bread and Butter in Holland, or 
there may be melted Butter ii^ a little Bafon 
for thofe who chufe it. It is to be noted, that 
the Parfley-Roots muft be taken before they 
run to Seed ; and if they happen to be very 
iargC;, they fhould be boiled by themfelves, for 

E 2 they

they will require more boiling than the Fifll. 
This I had fi-om Mr. Rozelli at the Hague, 

The following Receipt for drelling of Perch, 
I had like wife from the fame Perfon, and is an 
excellent Difh. 

To prepare Terch with Mufbrooms. 

PICK, and clean, and cut your Mufhrooms 
into fmail pieces, and put them in a Sauce- 
pan to flew tender witiiout any Liquor, but 
what will come from them , then pour off their 
Liquor and put a little Cream to tiiem 5 having 
ready at the fame time a Brace of large Perch 
well fcaied, wafh'd, and cut in Fillets or thick 
Slices, and parboil'd : Put your Perch thus pre- 
pared to your Mulhrooms, and with them the 
Yolks of three Eggs beaten, fome Parfley boifd 
^nd cut fmall, fome Nutmeg grated, a little 
Salt, and a little Lemon-Juice : keep all thefe 
flirring gently over a flow Fire, taking care not 
to break your Fifh ,• and when they are enough, 
garnifh them with Slices ot Lemon and pickled 
Barberries. 

The following general Sauce I had from the 
fame Perfon 5 it is always ready to be ufed with 
every kind of Flefh, Fowl, or Fifh that require 
rich Sauces, and will keep good twelve Months. 

ji Travelling Sauce. 

'^T^ A K E two Quarts of Claret, a quarter of 
-^ a Pint of Vinegar, and as much Verjuice 5 
put thefe together in a new Stone-Jar that will 
admit of being flopp'd cloie : Put to this a 
quarter of a Pound of Salt that has been well 

dry'd 



Director. 57 

dry*d over the Pire, an Ounce of Black-Pcppcr, 
a Drachm of Nutmeg beaten fine, and as much 
Cloves, a Scruple of Ginger, two or three little 
Bits of dry'd Orangc-Peel, half an Ounce of 
Muftard'Seed bruifed, half a dozen Shallots 
bruifed a little, five or fix Bay-Leaves, a little 
Sprig of Sweet Bafil, or Sweet Marjoram, a 
Sprig of Thyme, and a little Cinnamon ; then 
flop your Jar clofe, and let the Mixture infufe 
for twenty-four Hours upon hot Embers : when 
this is done, ftrain your Compofition through 
a Linnen Cloth, till you have exprcfs'd as much 
Liquor as poflible, and put it in a dry Stone 
Bottle or Jar, and flop it clofe as foon as 'tis 
cold. You muft keep this in a dry Place, and 
it will remain good twelve Months. This is 
a good Companion for Travellers, who more 
frequently find good Meat than good Cooks. 
My Author adds, that thofe who are Admirers 
of the Tafte of Garlick, may add it to this Sauce, 
or diminifh, or lesve our any particular Ingre- 
dient that they do not approve of. It may alfo 
be made of Water only, or of Verjuice, or 
of Wine, or of Orange or Lemon-Juice 5 but 
if it is made of Water, it will keep but a 
Month good : if it be made of Verjuice, it will 
laftgood three Months 5 if we make it of Vi- 
negar, it will laft a Year 5 or of Wine, it will 
laft as long. Ufe a little of this at a timej ■ 
ftirringit well when you ufe it. 

In this Month I likewife judge it will be a 
good Seafon to make the following curious Pre- 
paration for the ufe of Gentlemen that travel i 

E 3 the 



5 $ The Country Ladfs 

thcufc of which I eftecm to be of extraordinarj 
Service to fuch as travel in wild and open 
Countries, where few or no Prcvifions are to 
be met with 5 and it will be of no lefs Benefit 
to fuch Families as have not immediate Re- 
courfe to Markets, for the Readinels of it for 
making of Soups, or its Ufe where Gravey is 
required : and particularly to thofe that travel, 
the lightnefs of its Carriage, the fmali room 
it takes up, and the eafy way of putting it in 
ufe, renders it extremely ferviceable. This is 
what one may call Veal- Glue. 

To make Veal-Glue^ or Cake- Soupy to be car- 
ried in the Tocket. 

TAke a Leg of Veal, ftrip it of the Skia 
and the Far, then take all the Mufcular 
or Flelliy Parts from the Bones 5 boil this Flefh 
gently in fuch a quantity of Water, and fo 
long a time, till the Liquor will make a rtrong 
Jelly when 'tis cold : this you may try by ta- 
jcing out a fmall Spoonful now and then, and 
letting it cool. Here it is to be fuppofed, that 
tho' it will jelly prefently in fmall quantities, 
yet all the Juice of the Meat may not be ex- 
tradled i however,when you find it very ftrong> 
ftrain the Liquor thro' a Sieve, and let it fettle 3 
then provide a large Stew-pan with Water, and 
fomc China- Cups, or glazed Earthen- Ware i 
fiUthefc Cups with the Jelly taken clear irdm 
the Settling, and fet them in the Stew-pan of 
Water, and let the Water boil gently till the 
Jelly becomes thick as Glue : after which, let 

them

them {land to cool, and then turn out the Glue 
upon a piece of new Flannel, which will draw 
cue the Moifture ; turn them in fix or eight 
Hours, and put them upon a frefh Flannel, 
and fo continue to do till they are quite dry, 
and keep it in a dry warm Place : this will 
harden fo much, that it will be ftiffand hard as 
Glue in a little time, and may be carry'd in the 
Pocket without Inconvenience. We are to 
ufe this by boiling about a Pint of Water, and 
pouring it upon a piece of the Glue or Cake, of 
the bigncfs of a fmall Walnut, and ftirring it 
with a Spoon till the Cake diffolvcs, which 
will make very ftrong good Broth. As for the 
Seafoning Part, every one may add Pepper and 
Salt as they pleafe, for there muft be nothing of 
that kind put among the Veal when we make 
the Glue, for any thing of that fort would 
make it mouldy. Some of this fort of Cake- 
Gravey has lately been fold, as I am informed, 
at fome of the Taverns near Temple-Bar, 
where, I fuppofe, it may now be had. As I 
have obferv'd above, that there is nothing of 
Seafoning in this Soup, fo there may be always 
added what we defire, either of Spices or Herbs, 
to make it favoury to the Palate; but it muft be 
-noted, that all the Herbs that are ufed on this 
occafion, muft be boiled tender in plain Wa- 
ter, and that Water muft be ufed to pour upon 
the CakeGravey infteadof fimple Water : fo

tity may be ulcd that is prcfcribcd for Broth or 
Soup. I am informed by aPcrfon of Honour, 
that upon this Foundation, there has been made 
a Cakc-Gravey of Beef, which for high Sauces 
and flrong Stomachs, is dill of good ufe ; and 
therefore Iihall here give the Method of it. 

To make Cake-Sotip of Beef, &c. 

TAKE a Leg, or what they call in fomc 
Places a Shin of Beef, prepare it aspre- 
fcribed above for the Leg of Veal, and ufe 
the mufcular Parts only, as directed in the fore- 
going Receipt ; do every thing as abovcmen- 
tion'd, and you will have a Beef-Glue, which, 
for Sauces, may be more defirable in a Coun- 
try- Houfe, as Beef is of the ftrongeft nature of 
any Flcfh. Some prefcribeto add totheFlefh 
of the Leg of Beef, the Flelh of two old Hares, 
and of old Cocks to ftrengthen it the more i 
this may be done at pleafurc, but the Founda- 
tion of ail thefe Cake Graveys or Glues is the 
fuft. Thefe indeed are good for Soups and 
Sauces, and may beenrich'd by Cellary, Cher- 
villcj beat Chards, Leeks, or other Soup>Herbs. 
A little of this is alfo good to put .into Sauces, 
cither of Flcfli, Fifh, or Fowl, and will make 
a fine mixture v,dth the Travelling Sauce. So 
that whenever there is mentioned the Ufe of 
Gravey in any of the Receipts contamed in this 
Trcatife, this may be ufed on Feall-days, and 
the Mufnroom Gravcy, or Travelling Sauce 
on Fad- day 6.

cover then the whole with the Skin, and lay 
the Bones over that, covering all with Paper, 
and tying it down clofe ; after which, bake it 
with great Bread, and let it ftand in the Oven 
all Night. When this is done, take off the 
Bones and the Skin, and clear it from the Li- 
quor as well as you can, then put the Meat into 
a Wooden Bowl, and beat it as flnall as poUiblc 
with a Wooden Pcftle, often putting in feme 
Butter, and fome of the Fat of the Marrow, 
which will fwim upon the Gravey, but lufFer 
none of the Gravey to go in with it : when this 
is beat enough, while it is warm, butter the 
Bottom and Sides of the Pan which you de- 
fign to keep it in, and prefs down your Meat 
in it as hard as poliible 5 when that is done, 
cover it with melted Butter. If you would 
have your Meat look red, rub it with a little 
Salt-peter before you fealon it. By the fame Me-

earthen glazed Pot, and bake it three Hours> 
after which, take it out, and dry it from the

then cover it with clarified Butter. This Re- 
ceipt might have been put in fomcof the for-

Sage-leaves,, and a little Thyme, and fhred 
them fmall ; among which put an Ounce of 
Pepper ground fmall, half an Ounce of Cloves 
and Mace beat, and a Handful of Salt ; mix 
thefe together, and ftrew the mixture thick 
over the infide of your Meat, that when it is

To pott Trouts. From Mrs. R. S. ^/ Prefton 
in Lancafhire. 

CCale and clean your Trouts very well, wafh 
^ them in Vinegar, and flit them down the 
Back, after which put Pepper and Salt into the 
Incifion, and on their Outfides, and let them 
lie upon a Difh three Hours ; then lay them in 
an earthen glaz'd Pan, with pieces of Butter 
upon them, and put them in an Oven two 
Hours, if they are Trouts fourteen Inches long, 
or lefs in proportion, taking care to tie fomq 
Paper clofe over the Pan. When this is done, 
take away from them all the Liquor, and put 
them in a Potp and as foon as they are quite 

cold,

cold, pour fome clarified Butter upon them to 
cover them : Thefe will eat as well as potted 
Charrs. Some will take out the Bone upon 
flitting the Back, and thefe have been often ta- 
ken for Charrs 5 tho' I don't know above two 
Places where the Charrs are, one is a Pool 
where z River or Brook runs thro' in Lanca- 
fhire, ahd the other is in a Pool at Naant, 
within four Miles of Caernarvan. But the 
Charr is of the Trout kind, and it muft be a 
cTood ludge in Fifh to diftin^uifh one from ano- 
ther 5 however, there is fomc fmall difference, 
which the Criticks in fifhing take notice of. 

Fifh may alio be kept in Pickle feveral 
Weeks, as the Jack and Trout efpecially are 
agreeable Varieties. 

This time is a proper Seafon for making a 
pleafant and flrong Wine o^ Malaga Kci'iiins, 
which will keep good many Years, and among 
the bcft Judges of Wine is much admired 5 it 
is not unlike a flrong Mountain Wine : at this 
time alfo the Raifins are very cheap. 

To make Raijin Wine, 

TAke half a hundred weight of Malaga 
Raifins, pick them clean from the Stalks, 
and chop the Raifins fmall, then put them into 
a large Tub, and boil ten Gallons of River Wa- 
ter, or fuch Water as is foft, and pour it hot 
upon them , let this be ftirr'd twice or thrice 
every Day for twelve Days fuccefTively, and 
then pour the Liquor into a Cask and make 
a Toaft of Bread, and while it is hot, fpread

it on both fides with Ycaft or Barm, and put 
it into the Veffel to the Wine, and it will make 
it ferment gently, which you may Icnow by 
its making a hilling Noife; during the time of 
working, the Bung of the Vcflei muft be left 
open, and as foon as that is over, flop it up clofe. 
This will be fine and fit for Drinking in about 
four Months time 5 but if you make twice 
the quantity, it fhouid ftand five or fix Months 
before you broach it : Obferve that you fetit 
in a good Cellar, fuch as I have mentioned in 
the Month of March, under the Article of 
Brewing. 

To make Front eniac Wine. 

np H E foregoing Receipt muft be followed 
-■- in every particular, only when you put 
it into the Veffel, add to it fome of the Sy- 
rup of the white Fronteniac Grape^ which we 
may make in England^ tho' the Seafon is not 
favourable enough to ripen that fort of Grape 5 
for in a bad Year, when the white Fronteniac, 
or the Mufcadeila Grapes are hard and unripe, 
and without Flavour, yet if you bake them 
they will take the rich Flavour, which a good 
(hare of Sun would have given them. You 
may either bake the Fronteniac Grapes with 
Sugar, or boil them to make a Syrup of their 
Juice, about a Quart of which Syrup will be 
enough to put to five Quarts of the Raifia 
Wine. When thefe have work'd together, and 
flood a time, as direded in the foregoing Re- 
ceipt, you will have a Fronteniac Wine of as 

rich

Pieaiure of knowing that all the Ingredients 
arc wliolefomc. 

This Month is the principal time for Af- 
paragiis, which every one knows how to pre- 
pare in the common way ; but there are fome 
particulars relating to the fitting them for the 
Table, which I had from a curious Gentleman 
at Antverpy which I fhail here fee down. 

To preferve Afparagus. 
/^ U T aw^y all the hard part of your Afpa- 
^^ ragus, and juft boil them up with Butter 
and Salt, then fling them into cold Water, and 
prefcntly take them out again and let them 
drain ; when they are cold;, put them iti a Galli- 
pot, large enough for them to lie without bend- 
ing, putting to them fome whole Cloves, fome 
S^Xx,^ and as much Vinegar and Water, in equal 
quantities, as will cover them half an Inch-: 
then take a fingle Linnen Cloth, and let it in- 
to the Pot upon the Water, and pour melted 
Butter over it, and keep them in a temperate 
Place: When you ufe them, lay them to fteep 
in warm Water^ and drefs them as you would 
do frefli Afparagus. It is to be noted, that in 
Holland, and moft places abroad, the Afpara^ 
gusis always white, which is done according 
to a method that I have inferted in my o- 
thcr Works ; the method of bringing them to 
Table the foreign way, is to ferve them with 
melted Butter, Salt, Vinegar, and Nutmeg 
grated.

The Tops or Heads of Afparagus being bro- 
ken in fmall pieces and boil'd, are ufed in Soups 
like green Peafe. 

Afparagus in Cream, From the fame, 

Reak the Tops of your Afparagus in fmall 
Pieces, then blanch them a Y\ii\z in boiling 
Water, or parboil them, after which put them 
in a Stew-Pan or Frying-Pan with Butter or 
HogVLard, and let them remain a little while 
over a brisk Fire, taking care that they arc not 
too greafy, but well drain'd 5 then put them in 
a clean Stew-Pan with fotiie Milk and Cream, 
a gentle Seafoning of Salt and Spice, with a 
fmall Biineh of fweet Herbs i and juft when 
they are enough^ add to them the Yolks of two 
or three Eggs beaten, with a little Creani to 
bind your Sauec. 

The Greens, which are now fit for boiling, 
are Sprouts of Cabbages, and young Cabbage- 
Plants, v/hich every one knows how to pre- 
pare. There is alfo Spinage, which is beft 
itew'd without any Water, irs own Juice be- 
ing fufficients and we have dill plenty of 
Lupines, that is, the fiowring Stalks of Tur» 
nips, which eat very agreeably 5 they fhould be 
gathered about the length of Afparagus, when 
the Tops are 'knotted for flowering, and the 
firings in the outfide of the Stalks ftripp'd from

S this is the bufy Month in the Dair}% 
I (hall here infert the Remarks I have 
by me concerning the making of 
Checfes 5 and in this Work it is firft 
neccffary to know how to manage the Rennet. 
The Rennet is made of the Calves Bag, 
which is taken as foon as the Calf is kill'd, 
and fcour'd infide and outfide with Salt, after 
having firft difcharg'd it of the Curd, which 
is always found in it ; this Curd muft like wife 
be well wafh*d in a Cullender with ¥/ater, and 
the Hairs picked out of it till it becomes very 
white, then return the Curd asjain into the 
Bag, and add to it two good Handfulsof Salt, 
and fhut the Mouth of the Bag clofe with a 
Skewer, then lay the Bag in an Earthen-Pan, 
and cover it clofe, and keep it in a dry place ^ 
this will remain fit for ufe twelve Months. 
When you would ufe it, boil a Quart of Wa- 
ter, after you have faked it, fo as to bear aa 
Egg, and letting it ftand to be quite cold, pour 
it into the Bag, and prick the Bag full of very 
fniall Holes, and lay it in a clean Pan for 
ufe. While this Rennet is frefh, a Spoonful 
of the Liquor will turn or fet about fixteen 

E 2 or 



7i The Country Lady s 

or twenty Gallons of Milk 5 but as it is longer 
kept, it grows weaker, and muft be ufed in 
greater quantity : this Rennet will laft good 
about a Month. This is the Ejfex and Hert- 
ford jhire way. 

Another way of preparing of Rennet Bags, 
is to take the Calves Bag, and wafh and fcour 
it with Salt, and the Curd iikewife, as direded 
above 3 and then faking it very well, hang 
it up in the Corner of a Kitchen Cbrmney> 
and dry it 5 and as foon as you want to ufe it, 
boil Water and Salt, as before, and fill the 
Bag with it, making fmall Holes in the Bag, 
as before direded, and keeping it in a clean 
Pan. 

It is to be noted, that the Bag of the Calf, 
which is the part that receives the Milk, is fo 
difpofed, as to change the Milk into Curd, as 
foon as it is. received into it 5 and the Curd, 
which is found in it, partaking of that quality 
of the Bag, which difpofes it to harden the 
'Milk 5 thcfe are therefore to be preferv'd for 
the fame ufe, when wc employ common Milk 
to be made into Curd : but as the Calves Bag 
is warm, when it naturally receives the Milk 
from the Cow, and it then curdles in it ; fo, 
when wc want to fet or turn Milk, for Cheefe 
or other ufe, we muft have the Milk warm as 
one may guefs the Body of the Calf was, and 
the Milk was likewifc, when the Calf received 
it from the Cow. There is great danger if the 
Milk be too hot when the Rennet is put to it, 
for then it fcts or turns to Curd very quicks 

and 



Director. 73 

and the Cheefcwill be hard 5 but it is good to 
Jet the Milk be of fuch a warmth as' not to 
come too foon, as it is called in the Dairies, 
but to have it of iuch a warmth, as to let the 
Curd fet eafily, and come moderately, for the 
quicker the Curd comes, the hsrdcr it is, and 
the harder the Curd is, the harder is the Cheefe. 
Again, wc muft have fome regard to the Fa- 
ilure where our Cows feed ; thofe that feed in 
rank Grafs have more watery parts in their 
Milk than thofe Cows which feed on fhort, 
Grafs : and fomctimes, as I have obferved be- 
fore, in my other Works, the Cows feed upon 
Crow Garlick, or the Ailiaria, or Sauce alone, 
or Jack in the Hedge, or Goofe-i;rafs, or 
Clivers, or Rennet Wort, and their Milk 
will either be ill tafted, or clfe turn or curd 
of itfclf, altho' the Cow has had a due .time 
after Calving j and if the Goofe-grafs or Clivers 
happen to be the occaRon of the turning of the 
Milk, then a lefs quantity of Rennet fhpuld 
be ufed : for the only ufe of Rennet is tofix 
the Milk, and turn it to Curd, and if already 
there is near an equivalent for Rennet in thq 
Milk, by the Cow's eating fuch Herbs, then a 
little of it will do. But as I have obferv'd 
above,where Cattle feed upon long rank Grafs, 
the Milk is watery, and docs not contain two 
thirds of the Cream, or Richnefs that there is 
in the fame quantity of Milk from Cows fed 
upon fhort fine Grafs : So that if one was to 
make Cheefe, one would chufe the Milk of 
pows that fed upon the purcft fine Grafs, 

F 3 Here 



74 The Country Ladfs 

Here the Milk would be rich, and if the Ren- 
net is good and well proportioned, the Cheefe 
will be lb too. It is to be obferv'd likewife, 
that when Cows feed upon fuch Weeds as I 
have mentioned, I mean the Clivers, which 
turn their Milk, the Curd is always hard and 
fcatter'd, and never comes into a Body, as 
the pure Milk will do that is fet with Rennet, 
and confequently the Cheefe will be hard. 
There is one thing likewife to be taken no- 
tice of, with regard to the Rennet, that as the 
Bag, of which it is made, happens to be good, 
fo is the Rennet good in proportion. I mean 
the Bag is good when the Milk of the Cow, 
that fuckled the Calf, is good 5 for the good- 
nefs of the Feed of the Cow does not only 
difpofe the Body of the Calf to produce a gen- 
tlenefs or foftnefs in the Acid, which pro- 
motes the curdling of the Milk, when it is 
received into the Body of the Calf, bur makes 
the Rennet more tender to the fetting of the 
Cheefe-Curd, and fo the Cheefe will confe- 
quently be the better for it : And I judge that 
one reafon why the Suffolk Cheefe is fo much 
noted for its hardnefs, is on account of the 
badnefs of the Rennet, tho' it is certain, that 
the worft Cheefes of that Country are made 
of Skim-Milk 5 however, the nature of the 
Milk is fuch, according to my Obfervation, 
that it makes very rich Butter, but the Cream 
rifes on it fo quickly, and fo fubftantially, 
that it leaves no fatnefs or richnefs in the o- 
ther parr, which we call the Skim-Milk, but 

that 



Director. 75 

that remains little better than Water : fo that 

'tis no wonder in this cafe, and thro' the 

rank Feed of the Cows, that the Checfes of 

thofe parts are tot good. I think however 

the Cheefe of Suffolk might be help'd in a good 

meafure, if the Farmers there were to have 

their Rennet Bags from places where the 

Grafs was fhort and finej for I guefs then, 

from the above reafoning, that the Curd 

w^ould be of a more tender nature, or not of 

fo binding a quality as it now is, and the 

Cheefe confcquently would be the better. 

But befides thegoodnefs of the Milk and the 

Rennet, 4f a Cheefe is over prefs'd, it will be 

hard and unpleafant 3 but it is to be remarked, 

that all Cheefes that arc hard prefs'd will keep 

longer than thofe that are gently prefs'd, and 

bear tranfporting thro' the hotteft CHmates, 

which themore tender- made Cheefes will not 

without corrupting, unlefs they are put into 

Oil. There is one thing which I may obferve 

particularly, relating to the Rennet Bag ; which 

is, that the Calf fliould fuck it full about aa 

hour before it is kill'd, that there may be more 

and frefher Curd in it$ tho' in the killing 

of Calves it is a Rule to let the Calf faft feme 

time before killins:, which we are told con- 

tributes to the Whitencfs of the Flcfh. Again, 

it wouW be an advantage in the making 

of Cheefe to have your Cattle all of one 

fort, and to feed all upon the fame fort of 

Pafture^ for when it happens to be otherwife, 

the Cheefes are apt to decay, from the diffe-

thod prcfcribcd^ /. e. to break the Curd by 
gentle degrees, and as equally^as poffible every 
where : the little pains extraordinary will be 
paid in the goodnefs of the Cheefe, for then 
it will not be full of Eyes or Hollows, and will 
fell the better. 

But befidcs the way of preparing the Ren- 
net, asl have here fee down, it is praftifed to 
make an artificial Rennet, which will do very 
well for making of Chcele 5 and that is, to 
boil the Clivcr, or as fome call it Goofe-grafs, 
or others Rennet- Wort, in Water, and you may 
add fomc Tops of Sweet Bryarj about a Spoon- 
ful of Y/hich Decodion, or boiled Liquor,wiil 
turn a Pail-full of Milk, of about five Gallons, 
without any other help ; but in the Prepara- 
tion of this, as well as the other, for the 
Improvement of the Chccfcs, in giving them 
rich Flavours, it is advilcable to infert, while 
we are boiling the Waters for them, either 
fomc of fuch Sweet Herbs as we like, or fuch 
Spices as we mod covet x\\z tafte of As for 
the famous Stilton Checfc, which I have already 
publiilied the Receipt of, we are to make the 
Rennet llrong of Mace, by boiling the Mace 
in the Salt and Water, for without that is 
done, the Checfe will not have the true Relifh 
that the fird famous Stilton Cheefcs had ;

Reputation they have gain'd by their Checfcs. 
I (hall not pretend to affirm why the Cheefes 
now in that Town are not generally fo good 
as they were formerly j but perhaps it is be- 
caufe fome of the Cheefe-Sellers there depend 
upon the reputation of the firft Cheefes, and 
now buy Cheefes from other parts, where no- 
thing of the true Receipt is known but the 
Figure. However, it would be injuftice in me 
if I did not take notice, that the Mafter of the 
Blue-Belllnn in Stilton provided me with one 
that was excellent in its way, and yearly fur- 
nifhes as many Cuftomers with them as give 
him timely Notice : But as thefe Cheefes re- 
quire time in the Dairy, before they are fit for 
eating, and the Seafon of making them is in the 
Bloom of the Year, fo it is ncceffary to fpeak 
for them betimes, to have them to one's mind. 
I fhail not give the Receipt of it at this time, 
as it has already fallen into a good number of 
hands with my former Pieces, and has been 
thought good enough to have been copied 
from me, with many other Articles, and pub- 
lifhed by Mr. Lavjrence, I fhall proceed there- 
fore to give the Receipts for making of fome 
other kinds of Cheefes, which yet have not ap- 
peared in the World, which I have collcdcd 
from fome of the beft Dairies in England. 
The following is the famous Buckingham 
Cheefe, which 1 had from Mr. Foord, a very 
curious Gentleman cf that place. 

Ta 



7^ The Country Lad/s 

To make Buckingham Cheefe. From 
Mr, Foord of that Tlace, 

■pRepare a Checfe Vat or Chcefc Mote of 
■■■ a iquare Pigure, fix Inches over, and nine 
Inches deep, full of fmall Holes for the conve- 
nience of letting out the Whey when the 
Curd is put into it : Then take the Night's 
Cream, and mix it with the Morning's Milk, 
and put the Rennet to it to cool. When the Curd 
is come, take it gently from the Whey, and 
fill the Cheefe Vat with it, and lay a Board up- 
on the Curd, and as that finks, fill up th© 
Cheefe Vat with frefh Curds j this fhould be 
done once every Hour till Night. The next 
Day turn your Cheefe upfide down, and con- 
tinue turning it every Night and Morning till 
it Ihrinksfrom the Vat or Cheefe Mote, and 
is ftifF enough to take out without breaking, 
and then lay it upon the Shelf to be turn d, 
and fliiftit Night and Morning till 'tis dry for 
ufe. This Mr. Foord tells me is the bed fort 
of Cheefe he has met with in England. 

The following I have experienced to be an 
extraordinary Cheefe 5 in fome places 'tis call'd 
the Golden Cheefe, and in others the Mary- 
oold Cheefe, which it is properly. The Juice 
of the Marygolds adds a very great richnefsto 
the Milk, and contributes almofl: as much to it 
as Cream would do. The following is the 
Receipt to make it. 

To 



Director. 79 

To make Marygold Cheefe, 

GAther your Marygold Flowers in a dry 
Day, and pick the golden- coloured Leaves 
from them, ( thefe we call the Petals of the 
Flowers :) As foon as you have picked a fufficient 
quantity of thefe Leaves for your ufe, bruife 
them in a Mortar, or grind them, if you have 
Conveniency, and ftrain out the Juice s this 
Juice, when you put the Rennet to the Milk, 
muft be put into the Milk, and flirr'd into it. 
The Milk muft then be kt, and as foon as the 
Curd is come, break it ger\tly, and as equally as 
pollible, and put it into the Cheefe Vat, and 
prefs it with a gentle Weight, letting the bot- 
tom part of the Vat have fuch a number of 
Holes in it, as will let out the Whey eafily, or 
clfc a Spout to carry off the Whey 5 but the 
Holes are much better than the Spout. This 
Cheefe, which is made in a Cloth, muft be 
ufed like other Cheefes made after that manner. 
As for the making of Sage-Cheefe, the fol- 
lowing is tjhe beft way that I have met with, 
and therefoi^e I think the Receipt may be ufe- 
fui to the Publick. 

To make a plain Sage-Cheefe. 
/^Athcr the young Tops of red Sage, and 
^^ bruife them in a Mortar till you can prefs 
the Juice from them 5 then take Leaves of Spi- 
nach or Spinage, and bruife them like wife, and 
prefs out the Juice to mix with the Sage Juice 5

green Colour, and the Spinach Juice is added 

to it to render it more bright to the Sight 5 it 

alfo ferves to take ofFthe bitternefs of the Sage. 

When this Juice is prepared, put your Rennet 

to the Milk, and, at the fame time, mix as much 

of your Sage and Spinach Juice with it, as will 

give the Milk the green Colour you defire. If 

you would have it ftrong of the Sage, yoa muft 

have the greater fliare of Sage Juice i or weaker 

of the Sage, the greater fhare of Spinach Juice. 

When the Curd is come, b,reak the Curd gently, 

and when it is all equally broken, put it into 

the Vat or Cheefe Mote, and prcfs it gently : 

remember that the equal and due breaking of 

the Curd will keep your Cheefe from having 

Hollows or Eyes in ie, and the gentle prefllng 

of Cheefe will make it eat tender'and mellow. 

This, as well as the Marygold Ctieefe, muft be 

falted, when it has been prefs'd about eight 

Hours. 

To make Sage -Cheefe in Figures, 

THofe that are willing to have figured Chee- 
fcs, fuch Cheefes as are partly green and 
partly otherwife, muft take the following me- 
thod. Provide two Cheefe Vats of the fame 
bignefs, and fet your Milk in two different 
VefTcls i one part with plain Rennet only, and 
the other wit1i Rennet and Sage Juice, as di- 
reded in the above Receipt 5 niake thefc as you 
would do twodiftind Cheefes, and put them

of thefe Cheefes has been preft half an hour,

take them out and cut feme fquare Pieces, or 
long Slips, quite out of the plain Cheefc, and 
lay them by upon a Plate 5 then cut as many 
Pieces out of the Sage Cheefe, of the fame Size 
and Figure of thofe that were cut out of the 
plain Cheefe, and prefently put the pieces of 
the Sage Cheefe into the holes that were cut 
in the plain Cheefe, and the pieces cutout of 
the plain Cheefe into the holes of the Sage 
Cheefe^ contriving to make them fit exadly ; 
for this ufe fome nave Tin Plate, made into 
Figures of fevcral Shapes, with which they 
cut out the pieces of their Cheefes fo exadly, 
that they fit without trouble. When this is 
done, return them to the PrefTcs, and treat them 
like common Cheefes, fo will you have one 
Cheefe Sage, with white or plain Figures in it, 
and the other a v^hite Cheefe, with irreea 
Figures in it. In the making of thefe Chee- 
fes you muft particularly obferve to break your 
Curd very equally, andprefs both your Chee- 
fes as equally as pofilble before you cut out 
the Figures; for elfe when they come to be 
prefsy for the laft time, your Figures will prefs 
unequally and lofe their Shapes. When thefc 
Cheefes are made, they muft be frequently 
turn'd and fhifted on the Shelf, and often 
lubb'd with a coarfe Cloath. Thefe Cheefes 
may be made about two Inches thick, for if 
they are thicker, it will be more difficult to 
make the Figures regular ; thefe will be fit to 
cat in about eight Months.

if it is roughly prelVd, a great dealoftherich- 
nefs of the Milk will go into the Whey. As 
you thus gather your Curd, put it into the Vat

ing It as equally and tenderly as polTible, put 
it in a Cloth into the Vat, and fet it in the 
Prefs for an Hour i then take it out of the 
Prefs, and cut it in (mall Pieces, as big as Nut- 
megs, into a Pan of fcalding Water, taking 
them again foon out of the Water, and 
fprinkie them with Salt at your pleafare, and 
return them again to the Vat or Cheefe Mot^ 
and keep them in the Prefs till the next Mor- ^ 
ning, and after that turn them and wipe them 
often, till they come to be very dry 5 or eife 
when you have let one of thefe Cheefes prefs 
about two Hours, fait it on the upper fide, 
and turn it at Night, and fait the fide that lies 
uppermoft, to lie in the Prefs till Morning j 
butthefirft way of cutting and faking it is much 
the beft. Thefe Cheefes will be fit to cut when 
they have been made eight Months 5 it is to 
be obferv'd, that if we fait them in the man- 
ner fi^rft mentiond, that is, by cutting the 
Cheefe, fuch Cheefes will be fmooth-coated. 

To make Slip -Co at Cheefe^ which is the thin 
Summer Cheefe^ call'd in London Cream 
Cheefe. From the Farm call'd the Vaifes 
in Effex. 

T^Ake fix Quarts of new Milk, and a Pint 
-*- of Cream, put it together with a Spoon- 
ful of Rennet juft warm, and let it ftand till 
the Curd is come ; then lay a Gloath in your 
Cheefe Vat, and with a Skimming Difli cut 
out the Curd, and lay it in the Vat till it is full, 
turning your Cheefe-Cloath over itj and as 

the 



B^ The Country Ladfs 

the Curd fettles, lay more on, till you hav6 
laid on all. When the Whey is drained outj 
turn the Cheefe into a dry Cloath, and then 
lay a weight of a Pound upon it j at Night turn 
it into another dry Cloath, and the next Morn- 
ing fait it a little, then make a Bed of Nettles or 
Afh-Leaves to lay it on, and cover it with the 
fame, Ihifting them twice a day, till the Cheefe 
is fit to eat, which will be in about ten days. 
This Cheefe is approved to be the beft of the 
kind in the whole Country, and may be made 
all the Summer. 

It is to be obferv'd, that if in any fort of 
Cheefe, which is here mentioned, there is not 
a flrength or brisknefs of tafte agreeable to eve- 
ry Palate, it may be ftrengthned, by putting 
either Spice into the Rennet Bag, as Pepper, 
or Mace, or Cloves, which will make the 
Pvennet very ftrong, and the Cheefe of confe- 
quence morefharp to the Palate ; or elfe add the 
Juices of ftrong fweet Herbs to the Milk, when 
the Rennet is put in : the Juice of Marygolds 
efpecially helps the richnefs of the Milk, or 
Cheefe. The Mace in good quantity put into 
the Rennet will give the Cheefe a moft agree- 
able warmth. 

As for the Antipathy which fbnie People 
bear to Cheefe, I judge that it muft proceed 
from the firft impreilion made from the Nurfe 
that fuckles Children, or from the firft Cow's 
Milk that is given them : for as the Stomach is 
the firft pare which the NouriChment is re- 
ceived into i foj as that Nourifhment is at firft 
i ' ' favotb 



Director. $5 

favourably rcceiVd iiito the Stomach, fo the 
Tone of thb Stomach will ever remaia after- 
wards, unlefs it could be fo cleared from the 
firft Impreffion by fiich a Tryal as Human Na- 
ture can hardly bear. I gucfs too, that from 
this Prejudice in the Stomach proceeds the A- 
vcrfion which fome People have to the Smell 
of Cheefe j and if I may go a little farther this 
Vay, I fuppofe that the Diilike to Cats, and 
the Antipathy fome People bear to them, is 
from Frights which the Mothers have receiv'd 
from them durina their Preii^nancv : concerii- 
ing which laft Particular, I have offered my Sen- 
timents in the Article of the Longing of Wo- 
men , in ray Thilofophkal Account of the 
Works of Nature, But as for the other things, 
which (bme People bear an Averfion to, as 
the Mutton of black Sheep, or a Breaft of 
Mutton, &c, they depend upon the loathing 
of the Stomach, frdm the firft Impreffion. 
What I have remarked here, concerning the 
preparing and , foftning of the quality of the 
Rennet Bag, is in part a reafon for the firft good 
or bad Impreffion that may be made upon Mali- 
kind with regard to Cheefci and I think the 
following relation, which I had from a rldble 
Peer, from w^hom I have learnt many curious 
and ufeful things, tending to the good of my 
Country, will be acceptable to the World. 

Some Gentlemen that had been hunting , 
and were led by their Sport to a retir'd 
part of the Country, where they found only 
a Cottage to refrelh themfelves in, were forcd 

G to 



S6 The Country Ladfs 

to take up with Bread and Cheefej there was 
nothing elfe to be had, and they had craving 
Stomachs : but one of the Company was fo 
unfortunate as to have an averfion to Cheefe, 
and could never bear either the tafte or Imell 
of it 5 however, at this time feeinghow heartily 
it was eaten by his Companions, and being very 
hungry, he refolved to venture upon it, and 
eat heartily of iti but about an hour after was 
taken fo very ill with Purging and Vomiting, 
that in a fhort time his Life was defpair'd of* 
He had the Advice of the beft Phyficians, but 
no Medicine took place, and he was given over, 
after he had lain in that condition a Week j 
however, at length the Diftemper went off, 
and by degrees he got ftrength enough to go 
homeward, and in his way happening to flop 
at an Inn, where there flood a Waggon Load 
of Chefhire Cheefes, he found that he had a 
ftrong Appetite to cat feme of that fort, and had 
one cut on purpofe, and eat heartily of ir, 
without fufFcring the leafl: inconvenience, and 
has ever fince been a great lover of Cheefe. 
So that there is an Example of getting over 
this Averfion 5 but confidering the difficulty he 
went thro', it fhews the danger of fuch an 
Attempt : Nothing Icfs than the violent Scou- 
ring he underwent could have changed the firft 
Impreffion made in his Stomach. But thus far 
of Cheefe. 

It is neceflary, in the next place, to fay 

fomething of Butter, and how far that 

may be mended in many parts of England, 

' ' . as 



D I R E C T O R.^ §7 

^s well for private as for more general 

ufe. 

In the firft place it is to be remarked, that 
fome Grounds will never produce good Butter, 
and others will not produce good Cheefe, 
tho' there is the beft management in the Dairy. 
Again, there is one fort of Cattle,which tho' we 
feed them in the finefl: Grafs, and beft Failure, 
will never yield a rich Milk 5 while on the 
other hand, there are fome forts of Cattle 
which will yield a rich Milk for Butter in any 
Pafture : tho', as I have obferv'd before, the 
Milk and Butter will be ill tafted if the Cows 
fed upon Crow-Garlick, AUiaria, or Saxi- 
frage. What I have faid of this, with regard 
to the making of Cheefe, muft here be confi- 
der'd) that is, if the Cows feed upon fhort fine 
Grafs, there will be more Cream in the Milk 
than if they feed upon long rank Grafs. In- 
deed the long rank Grafs will give more Milk 
than the fhort, but lefs Butter, and worfe into 
the bargain. Again, the Milk of one Cow 
fhall give richer and better Butter than the 
Milk of others, tho' they all feed on the fame 
Pafture, even fo that the Milk of one Cow will 
cover or enrich the Butter made from nine or 
ten other Cows 5 her Milk will make Butter 
©f a rich yellow Colour, full of Fatnefs, and 
the others will only produce a pale, lean But- 
ter, but all together will be good : I know fe- 
veral Inftances of this, and every one who is 
skilful in a Dairy may obferve it. I have al- 
ready treated largely concerning this Particular, 



8 8 The Country Ladfs 

in my Works of Husbandry, and I fhall there- 
fore proceed to fpeak of the Management of 
Milk in the Dairy for making Butter 5 for I am 
very fenfible, that many Farmers might have 
twice the Benefit from their Dairies, if the 
Articles of Butter and Chcefe were confider'd 
in a rational way, and the old Cuftom could 
be broke through 5 and moreover, if the beft 
Rules for managing of the Dairy were known, 
and put in pradice, the whole Country would 
be the better for it, every one might enjoy the 
benefit of good things : whereas for want of 
knowledge among fome Farmers, their Goods 
are of fmall value, and the People are alfo 
diffatisfied. 

In many parts oi England ^ it is common to 
fet Milk in Brafs Pans, and that gives an ill 
Tafte to the Milk 5 and again, there is a cuftom 
of fetting the Cream in Brafs-Kettles over the 
Fire, and as it warms to ftroak the Butter as it 
rifes to the edge of the Kettle : this way is very 
bad for Butter, for the warm Brafs affuredly 
will fpoil the Tafte of the Cream, and it is 
often fmoak'd. The fureft way is to fet the 
Milk in glaz'd Earthen Pans or in Leaden 
Pans, but the Earthen Pans are preferable. 
It fhould be particuUriy obferv'd, that the 
Dairy be kept cool, for that in hot Weather 
contributes greatly to the Advantage of the 
Butter : I have known fome that have had 
Streams of Water running thro* them, and at 
the fame Places, inftead of Glafs Windows, 
there have been no Lights at all to them but 

thro' 



Director. S9 

thro' Wyer, and Shutters to them, to open 
or elofe as the Sun changed its Courfe. The 
thatching of the Dairy is much cooler alio than 
Tyling 5 and whatever will contribute to keep 
©ffthe Sun, fhouid be pradis'd. There are yet 
in fome Places in England fome Farmers that 
do not know the ufe of i:he Churn j however, 
it is certain, that there is no better way of 
making Butter than by that means, or fome- 
thing equivalent to it i that is, by beating the 
Cream, fo that the Oily, or ^at Parts feparate 
from the Watery Parts, in the moil conilant 
and gentle way that is poilible, for to ufe 
this beating of the Cream too violently, will 
make the Butter like Greafe j whereas a gentle 
beating of the Cream will render it more 
firm or fliff: and befides, when the Cream is 
beat with too much hurry, the Butter will 
ferment, and prefently change to be of a bad 
Taile 5 but if it be gently beat or churned, it 
will be firm, and will be fit for keeping. A- 
gain, it muit be obferv'd, that as the beating 
or churning of Cream, to bring it to Butter, 
is only to feparate the oily from the watery 
Parts of the Cream, fo when once you begin 
to churn, or beat the Cream, you muil con- 
tinue to churn or beat it in the moil conilant 
manner you can, till the Butter is made : for 
if you had perhaps beat the Cream within 
three or four Minutes of its becoming Buttei*^ 
if you leave off the Work but a Minute^ the 
oily and watery Parts will return to one a- 
nother, and will require as much Labour as 

G 3 before 



90 The Country Lad/s 

before to feparate them : it is like Oil and 
Vinegar that have been mix d by Labour, and 
then let alone for a Minute or two, they 
will divide and feparate from one another, 
as much as if they had never been mix'd 5 
but the beating of it too violently, will make 
the Butter oily, as obferv'd before. As for 
the Figure of our common Churn, Ifhallnot 
give a draught of it, becaufe fuch as are un^ 
acquainted with it may underftand it much bet- 
ter by feeing a Model of it, which may be 
had at any Toy-Shop in London 5 nay, the 
very beating of Cream with a Spoon, in a fmall 
Bowl, will bring it to Butter $ but it muft be 
beat regularly. 

In the great Dairies in Holland^ where one 
Farmer keeps four or five hundred Cows, the 
Cream is put into a large Well, lined with 
Lead, and a large Beam fet with crofs Bars is 
turn'd in the Cream by a Horfe 5 but the vio- 
lence of the Motion makes the Butter rather 
like Oil than Butter , and the confequence is, 
that it will not keep long, and as I have heard 
fay, will not melt well, like the Biitter that 
is made by more gentle means. Where a 
gentle way is ufed in making Butter, it will cut 
like Wax, and it fhould efpecially be well 
"wrought with the Hands, when it is frefh 
taken from the Churn and falted for common 
ufe 5 for if the Milk be not well work'd out 
of it, the Butter will not keep. However, if 
Butter begins to decay in goodnefs, or change 
to au ill Tafte;> l^t it be worked well, and 

•vv^a(h'4 



Director.' 91 

wafh'd with Water, and it will come to itfelf, 
and will bear faking and potting as well as 
frefh Butter 5 but always obferve not to put 
up Butters of feveral forts into the fame Pot 
or Veffel, but chufe that of the fame Dairy, 
and of the fame making, ifpollible. One of 
the moft curious Women I have met with 
in this way, is Mrs. Cowen^ a Shopkeeper at 
Newport Vond in EffeXy who pots great 
quantities every Year 3 there are undoubtedly 
many others who are very good in this way, 
but as I do not know them, therefore I may 
be excus'd if I mention her in particular. 

Again, Butter that was good originally, and 
well potted, may be wafh'd and beaten in the 
Winter, fo as to be made more fweet and pala- 
table than frefh Butter, made in many Places, 
at that time of the Year 5 and this is frequently 
pradifed about London^ where the workers of 
it get more than twice the firfl: Price of the 
Butter, by their Care and Labour. 

Before 1 conclude this Article, it may be 
neceifary to obferve, that the beft managers of 
the Dairy frequently fill up their Churns with 
cold Water, before they put in the Cream to 
churn, in the heat of the Summer, for fear 
of over-heating the Butter in the making, and 
in the Winter heat their Churns with warm 
Water before they ufe them, but the over- 
heating of the Churns fpoils the Butter 5 the 
beft way is to fet the bottom of the Churn 
in warm Water, when you churn in cold 
Weather, to favc Trouble, 

G 4 I 



92 The Country Ladys 

I fhall now proceed to fay fomething of 
preparing Cordial Waters,- for this Month 
gives us a vail variety of Herbs in full per- 
fedion, and in the moft proper condition for 
the ufe of the Shops, whether for drying, in- 
fufing, difdlling, &c. 

In the firft place, all Herbs defign'd to be 
dried, mull be gather'd in dry Weather, and 
laid in fome Room, or covered Place, to dry in 
the Shade, to be afterwards ufed for infufion 
or diftillation, for which Bufincfs the dried 
Herbs are as ufeful as the green Herbs, if they 
be fuch as are Aromatick, viz. Thyme, Sweet 
Marjoram, Savory, Hyfop, Sage, Mint, Rofe- 
mary, the Leaves of the Bay-Tree, the Tops 
of Juniper, Gill, or Ground Ivy, and fuch 
like: Tiie Infiifions, or Spirits, drawn from 
dried Herbs are more free from the Earthy and 
Watery Parts, than the Infufions, or Spirits 
drawn from green Herbs. I obfcrve, that iu 
niakins; fuch Infufions as Teas of dried Herbs, 
the beft way is to pour boiling Water upon 
them, and in half a Minute, at mod, pour 
out the Water again from the Herbs, if we 
have them in fmall quantities, as we do Sage 
Tea, or other Tea 3 fuch Tea will then be of 
a fine green Colour, and full of Spirit : but 
if the Herbs ftand longer with Water upon 
them, the Water will change of a brownifh 
Colour, will lofc the fine Flavour of the 
Herb, and become ill tafted; fo that in the 
making of Sage Tea, for example, pour on 
your boiling Water^ and v/hen it has been half a 

Minute 



Director^ 91 

Minute upon the Sage-Leaves, pour it ofF and 
fling away the Leaves 5 for if you pour more 
Water upon them, you muft expeft your Tea 
of a dark Colour and ill tafted : therefore have 
frefh Sage to every frefh quantity of Water. 
And the fame method fhould be ufed in the 
making of all kinds of Teas, to make them 
palatable and more wholefome. But when I 
fpeak of Teas having good qualities in them, 
I muft not be underftood to mean any of the 
Foreign Teas, fuch as Green, and Bohea Teas, 
(ire, for 1 have had experience enough in them 
to know that they are injurious to the Body, 
of which 1 fhall fay more in a Treatife by it 
felf. What I mention here, is only with re- 
gard to the infufing of Herbs in the Tea man- 
ner 3 but there are Infufions of Herbs in Spi- 
rits: here the Spirit that the Herbs are put 
into, muft be cold, or ufed without any Fire at 
ail, and the Herbs in this cafe may be ufed ei- 
ther green or dry 5 here they mayftand feve- 
ral days before the Spirit that they are infus'd 
in be drawn oft"", as the following Cordial, 
^aird Surfeit Water, may ferve to inftance. 

To make red Surfeit- Water. Fram Mrs, B. 

T^O three Gallons of Brandy, put the Flow» 
^ er Leaves of aBufhel of red Poppies, one 
Pound of Raiflns of the Sun ftoned, a large 
Stick of Liquorice diced, a quarter Pound of 
Caraway-Seeds bruifed, a large Handful of 
Angelica, Sweet Marjoram, red Sage, Dragon s 
Mint, and Baulm, of each a handful j let all 

thcfc 



94 The Country Ladfs 

thefe be cover'd clofe in a Glafs, or glaz'd 
Earthen Veffel, and (land to infufe or fteep 
in the Brandy for nine Days, keeping it, during 
that time, in a Cellar 5 thenftrain it off upon 
a Pound and half of Loaf-Sugar, and put it into 
Bottles. This is a good Cordial, if ufed only 
when occafion requires. 

In this Month, Orange-Flowers are in the 
greateft plenty 5 about half a Pound of them 
put into a Gallon of Brandy, with a quarter 
Pound of Orange-Peel, and half a Pound of 
double refin d Loaf-Sugar, makes a very agreea- 
ble Cordial : We may let thefe Ingredients in- 
fufe in the Brandy nine or ten days before we 
pour the Brandy from them. Some chufe 
rather to put the Sugar to the Brandy after it 
ispour'd from the Orange-Flowers. 

As for the diililiing part, we have already fe- 
veral Books which treat largely of that Bufinefs, 
both with refped to the management of what 
is caird the cold Still, and the Alembick, to 
which I fnail refer : ^but in this place I Hiall 
only take notice, that whereas feveral kinds of 
diftiird Waters are drawn from many Herbs, 
which do not appear all the Year about ; fo if 
one has not an opportunity of colleding all 
our Herbs together, juft w^hen we want them, 
wc may yet diftil thofe we can get at one 
time, and make another Diftillation of thofe 
we collcft at another time, and fo mix both 
Spirits Qr Waters together: For Example, in 
thofe Cordial Waters where the Ros Solis, 
or Rofa Solis is ufed, which is an Herb not 

z always 



Director.^ 95 

always to be found, and will not keep above 
a day or two after 'tis gathered, this I fay may 
be diftiird by itfelf, and kept to ufe with 
other Waters at pleafure 5 putting of this fuch 
a proportion as would have been produced 
from the quantity direded, of the Plant, in the 
Receipt, if it had been diftilFd with the other 
Herbs : and fo of any other Herb that is hard 
to come by. 

This Herb, however, I may inform my 
Reader, grows in Bogs, and when we find it we 
may preferve it artificially, by cither planting 
it immediately in other boggy places, or elfe 
in artificial Bogs, made of Earth and Water 
in Tubs, or Earthen Pots, made without holes 
at the bottom. 

This Seafon affords us great variety of Ne- 
ceffaries for Food, in the Farm and Garden ; the 
PondFifh, as Pike or Jack, Carp, Tench, and 
Perch, as well as Eels are in Seafon, and may 
be prepared for the Tzhlc.^s d'ncOLcdinMarcb 5 
there are likewife green Geefe, young Ducks, 
Chickens, Pigeons, and Rabbits in the artifi- 
cial Warren 5 and in the Garden, Spinage and 
Cabbage-Lettuce to boil^ fome forward Peafc 
and Beans, Afparagus, Artichokes, the firft 
Cabbages, and Caulyflowcrs, Cucumbers for 
ftewing and in raw Sallads : however, in this 
Seafon all raw Sallads fhould yet partake of 
fome warm Herbs, as I have direfted in my 
New Improvement of Planting ayid Garden- 
ing, The Method which I moft approve of 
for dreffing a Sallad, is, after v/e have duly 

pro- 



9<^ The Country Ladys 

proportioned the Herbs, to take two thirds Oil 
Giive, one third true Vinegar, fomc hard Eggs 
cutfmail, both the Whites and Yolks, a little 
Salt and fome Muftard, all which muft be 
well mix'd and pour'd over the Sallad, having 
firft cut the large Herbs, fuch as Sallcry, En- 
dive, or Cabbage-Lettuce, but none of the 
fmail ones : then mix all thefe well together, 
that it may be ready juft when you v/ant to 
ufe it, for the Oil will make it prefently fof- 
XQ.ny and lofe its brisknefs. Onions fhould 
always be kept in referve, becaufe it is not 
every one that like their relifli, nor is Oil a- 
greeable to every one j but where Oil is not 
liked, the Yolks of hard Eggs, bruised and mix d 
with the Vinegar, may be ufed as above. The 
difficulty of getting good Oil in England^ is, I 
fuppofe, the reafon why every one does not 
admire it 5 for I was once of opinion I could 
never like it : but when I was once perfuaded 
to tafte fuch as was of the bed fort, I could 
never after like a Sallad without it. The beft 
Oil that 1 have met with in England^ is at Mr. 
Crojfe's, a Genouefe Merchant, at the Genoiiefe 
Arms in Katherine Street ^ in the Strand^ 
London, 

As for the ordering of the above Animals 
and Vegetables for the Table, we may find 
Directions in this Work. 

In this Month gather Elder-Flowers when 
they are dry, and pick them from the Stalks i 
kt them dry in the Shade, and then put

About the end of this Month is a proper 
time to make Sage- Wine, which is a very 
pleafant one, and I think worthy a place

To make SageJVine. From Mrs, E. B. 

T^ O three Gallons of Water put fix Pounds 
"*- of Sugar, boil thefe together, and as 
the Scum rifes take it off, and when it is well 
boiled put it in a Tub boiling hot, in which 
there is already a Gallon of red Sage Leaves 
clean picked and wafh'd i when the Liquor is 
near cold, put in the Juice of four large Le- 
mons, beaten well with a little Ale Yeaft, 
mix thefe all well together, and cover it very 
clofe from the Air, and let it ftand forty 
eight Hours 5 then ftrain all thro' a fine Hair- 
Sieve, and put it into a Veflel that will but juft 
hold it, and when it has done working, flop it 
down clofe, and let it ftand three W^eks or a 
Month before you bottle it, putting a Lump 
of Loaf- Sugar into every Bottle. This Wine 
is beft when it is three Months old. After 
this manner you may make Wine of any other 
Herb or Plower^

JUNE, 



^^ ^HIS Month is a proper Seafon for 
making feveral forts of Wine, whe- 
ther it be that of Goosberries, Cur- 
rants, Q^erries, Apricots, or Raf^ 
berries, all which arc very agreeable and worth 
the trouble i theExpence, where thefe Fruits 
are growing, being very inconfiderablc. The 
following Receipts are approved to be very 
excellent. 

Preliminaries to the making of Goosberry- 

Wine. 

GOosbcrry-Wine is one of the richeft and 
ftrongeft Wines made in England, it will 
keep many Years, and improve by keeping, 
if it be well made i and is not, in my opinion, 
inferior to Mountain Malaga, 

To make this Wine, we muft have regard 
to the fort of Goosberry we defign to ufe, for 
there is a great deal of difference in the time 
of one fort's ripening and another : the earlieft 
ripe are the Champaign, the Green, the Black, 
and Red hairy Goosbenies, every one of which 
has a Flavour diftinft from the other forts, and 
fo will yield each of them a Wine of as diffe- 
rent arelifhfrom the reft, as one may cxpeft 

to 






Director. 99 

to find among the feveral Varieties of the 
French growth. The moft forward of thefe 
kinds 2.boui London npcn early in this Month, 
if the Seafon be good j but the later forts arc 
not generally ripe till the end of the Month, 
or in y^fy' The later forts are commonly the 
white Dutch, the Amber, and the Walnut- 
Goos berries, each of which has like wife a dif- 
ferent fort of tafte : of the Amber efpecially 
I have known an excellent Wine to be made, 
Asain, we muft confidcr, that as to the time 
of their ripening, the diverfity of Situations 
will forward or retard them a Fortni^^ht or 
three Weeks ; and befides, as we have obfer- 
vcd above, every Seafon is not alike, and we 
muft have regard alfo to the difference of Cli- 
mate, one part oi Britain is three Weeks 
fooner or later than another : and when I fay 
in any one of my Kalendars, or Monthly Di- 
redories, that any particular Fruit is ripe, or 
any particular thing is to be done in fuch a 
Month, it muft be underftood that it is gene- 
rally fo, but will vary now and then, as the 
- Seafon is more or lefs forward. There is 
likewife another thing to be confider'd rela- 
ting to the ripenefs of Fruits, and that is, the 
different Opinions or Taftes of Mankind 5 fome 
call them ripe when they juft begin to turn : 
but what I mean by ripenefs, is, when a Fruit 
is as tender as it can be, and poffelling its 
higheft: Flavour : And by thofe Fruits which I 
call half ripe, I mean fuch as have their in- 
j\^ard Juices fwcet, and their outward Parts a 

little

Goosberry be gathered for making of Wine- 
See the following Receipt,

plained in the above Preliminaries, pick therrt

of aPeck of thebruifed Goosberries, put theni 
into a Bag made of Horfe-Hair, and prefs theni 
as much as poffible, without breaking the 
Kernels : repeat this Work till all your Goos- 
berries are prefs'd, and adding to this prefs'd 
Juice, the other which you v/ill find in the Tub, 
add to every Gallon three Pounds of powder 
Sugar, for Lisbon Sugar will give the Wine a 
tafte which may be difagreeable to fome Peo- 
ple, and befides it will fweeten much more 
than the dry powder Sugar ; ftir this together 
till the Sugar is diifolved, and then put it in a 
Veffel or Cask, which muft be quite fiil'd with 
it. If the Veffel holds about ten or twelve Gal- 
lons, it muft ftand a Fortnight or three Weeks 5 
or if about twenty Gallons, then about four 
or five Weeks, to fettle, in a cool Place : thea 
draw off the Wine from the Lee, and after 
you have difcharg d the Veffel from the Lees, 
return the clear Liquor again into the Veffel, 
and let it ftand three Months, if the Cask is 
about ten Gallons 5 or between four and fiv6 

Months;,

Months, if it be twenty Gallons, and then 
bottle it off. We mufc note, that a fmall 
Cask of any Liquor is always iboncr ripe and 
fit for drinking than the Liquor of a larger 
Cask will be ; but a fmail Body of Liquor 
will fooncr change four, than that which is 
in a larger Cask. The Wine, if it is truly pre- 
pared, according to the above Direftions, will 
improve every Year, and laft feveral Years. 

Preliminaries to the making of Currant 

Wine. 

T is to be noted, that tho' there are two 
forts of Currants, which mav be ufed for 
making of Wine, that is, the Red and the 
White 5 yet the Tafte and Goodnefs will be the 
fame, whether 'tis made of the White or the 
Red, for they have both the fame^Quaiities, 
except \x\ the Colour. Obferve-^fo, that the 
Pruit be gatherd in a dry time, and that if 
you make a large Quantity, it muft ftand 
longer in the VeiTcl, before bottling, than a 
fmall Quantity. 

To make Currant Wine. 

WHEN your Currants are full ripe, gather 
them, and pick them from the Stalks 
and weigh them, in order to proportion your 
Water and Sugar to them. When this is 
done, bruifc them to pieces with your Hands, 
and add to every three Pounds of Currants a 
Quart of Water, ftirring all together, and let- 
ting it ftand three Hours, at the end of which 

H time, 



I02 The Country Ladfs 

time, ftrain it off gently thro' a Sieve, and 
put your Sugar into your Liquor, after the 
rate of a Pound to every three Pounds of 
Currants. This Sugar fliould be powder Sugar, 
for Lisbon Sugar would give the Wine an ill 
Tafte. Stir this well together, and boil it till 
you have taken off all the Scum, which will 
rife plentifully ; fet it then to cool, at lead 
fixteen Hours, before you put it into the Veffel. 
If you make the Quantity of twenty Gallons, 
it may fland in the Veffel three Weeks before 
it will be fit for bottling; and if you make 
thirty Gallons, then it muft ftand a Month be- 
fore it be bottled off, obferving then to put a 
fmall Lump of Sugar into every Bottle 5 it muft 
be kept in a cool place, to prevent its Fretting. 
By this Method it will keep good many Years, 
and be a very ftrong and pleafant Wine, at a 
very cheap rate. 

It isneceffary to obferve, that the fame fort of 
Currant is not always of the fame Sweetnefs 
when it is ripe, thofe growing in the Shade 
will be lefs fweet than thofe that are more ex- 
pofed to the Sun. And when the Summer 
happens to be wet and cold, they will not be 
fo fweet as in a dry warm Seafon 5 therefore 
tho' the Standard of the above Receipt be one 
Pound of Sugar to three Pounds of pick'd Cur- 
rants, yet the Palate of the Perfon who makes 
the Wine fhould be the Regulator, when the 
Sugar is put to the Juice, confrdering at the 
fame time, that it is a Wine they are making, 
and not a Syrup. The Sugar is only put to 

foften 



D 1 R E C T O R. TO 5 

fbften and prcfcrve the Juice, and too much 
will make the Wine ropey. 

This Sea Ton is proper tor making Cherry 
Wine, the Kenlifh and Flemijh Cherries being 
now full ripe, which are much the bed for 
this purpofe : This is a very pleafant ftrong 
Wine. 

To make Cherry Wine, 

Atheryour Cherries in dry Weather, when 
they are full ripe, pick them from the 
Stalks, and bruife them well with your Hands 
till they are all broken 5 then put them into 
a Hair Bag, and prefs them till you have as 
much Liquor from them as v/ill run without 
breaking the Stones. To every Gallon of this 
Juice, put one Pound of powder Sugar, and 
having itirr'd it well together, boil it and 
fcum it as long as any Scum will rife 5 then 
fct it m a cool Place till it is quite cold, and 
put it into your Vcffel, when it will prefent- 
ly begin to work. When the Working is over, 
flop the Veffel clofe, and \zx. it (land four 
Months 3 if it holds the Quantity of twenty 
Gallons^ or more or X^X^.-, as the Quantity hap- 
pens to be, then bottle it off, putting a Lump 
of Loaf-Sugar into each Bottle. It will keep 
two or three Years, if it be fet in a cool 
Place. 

I have now done with the Wines that are 
to be made in this Month : I fhall in the next 
place fet down the Method of keeping or pre- 
serving Pi^uits for Tarts all the Year about, as I 

H ^ had 



id4 The Country Ladfs 

had it from a very curious Pcrfon, in whofc 
Houfe 1 have fcen it pracliicd with extraor- 
dinary Succcfs. The Fruits which are chiefly 
to be put up this Month, are Goosberries, Cur- 
rants and Cherries. , 

To preferve Fruits for Tarts all the Tear. 

'Tp H E Goosberrics muft be full grown, but 
X not ripe, they muft be gathered in dry 
Weather, and pick'd clean of their Stalks and 
Tops 5 then put them into Quart Bottles, that 
arc made on purpofe, with large wide Necks, 
and cork them gently with new found Corks, 
and put them into an Oven after the Bread is 
drawn, Jetting them ftand there till they have 
fhrunk about a fourth part, obferving to change 
them now and then, bccaufe thofe which you 
fet at the further part of the Oven, will be 
fooneft done. When you find them enough, 
according to the above Dircdion, take them 
out, and immediately beat the Corks in as tight 
as you can, and cut the Tops off even with the 
Bottles, and pitch them over i you muft then 
fet your Bottles by, in a dry Place, I have 
tafted of Fruits done this way, that have made 
as good Tarts at the Year's end, as thofe that 
were frefh gathered : The only difference be- 
tween the prefcrving Goosberries and Cur- 
rants, is, that the Currants muft be full ripe 
when we put them into the Bottles, and fo 
likewiic the Cherries. 

There is another way of putting up Fruits 
for this ufe, which is, by half preferving them 

with 



Director. 105 

with Sugar, /. e. half a Pound of Sugar to eve' 
ry Pound of Fruit. Apricots efpccially, when 
they are near ripe, make excellent Tartsj be- 
ing fp I it and pared from the Skin, and boiled 
in a Syrup, they will keep the Year round, as 
an ingenious Lady has told me. It is alfo to 
be remarked, that ripe Goosberries make very 
fine Tarts. 

The beginning of this Month, when the 
Goosberries are full grown, bat not ripe, is the 
right Seafon for prefervingofthcm in fwect- 
meat : The white Stitch Goosbcrry is the beft 
for this ufe. 

So likewife if you have plenty of Kentijh 
Cherries, pickfome of them from the Stalks, 
and lay the Cherries upon a fine Wire Sieve, 
and dry them in an Oven 5 when they are 
dried enough, and quite cold, put them in an 
Earthen glazed Jar, and (lop them up clofe : 
Thefe muft be kept in a dry place. 

Upon the foot of the above Receipt, for 
preferving of Fruits, I have a Notion that 
we may preferve green Peafe, aft^r the fame 
manner, in Bottles, that I have mentioned for 
the preferving of Goosberries, Currants, &€. 
So that they will eat tender and well tafted at 
Chrijimas: it is well worth the tryal, feeing 
that a Bottle or two cannot be any great Ex- 
pence, and that Peafe are acceptable almoft 
to every one. This I have perfuaded fome of 
my Acquaintance to try, but particularly a 
very curious Perfon in fuch matters, who tells 
me, that provided this method anfwers what 

H 3 we 



I c6 The Country Ladfs 

we. aim at, he fuppofcs they will be the nioft 
agreeable, either to be boiled with Cream, or 
(Icw'd in Gravey, ^itcx xho. French manner, for 
it is a.difputc with him, whether they will hold 
their green Colour; but, as I oblerv'd befoic, 
it may be try'd at an eafy Expence. 

The beginning of this Month is the time to 
piekle Walnuts, for then the Walnuts have 
not began to fhell, and mor^cTr are not fo 
bitter nor hollow as they will be afterwards^ 
they will now be full fiefh'd, and you will 
have no Lofs. The follov/ini; Method I learnt 
from Mr. Foord^ a curious Gentleman of 
Buckingham^ and has been experienced to be 
the bed way. There is one thing indeed 
which mud be regarded in this Pickle, which 
is, that every one does not love the Tafte of 
Onion or Garlick j but that may be omitted as 
■WcplcafCjOnly fupplyingthe place vyith Ginger.

the outer Skin, and let them lie till they are

of Salt and Water, and let them (land 24 
Hours ^ then take them out, and put them 
again into frefn Salt and Water for 24 Hours 
rnorc ; then lliift them as before, and continue 
this Fradice for fourteen^Days, at the end of 
which time wipe them dry, and lay them in 
a glazed earthen Pot;, Strattim fiiper Stratum^ 

with 



Director. 107 

with Spice, whole Muftard-Seed, Horfe-Ra- 
didi {lic'd, and Garlick, or Efchalots : that is 
to fay, make a Layer of Walnuts, aud flrevv 
over it whole Pepper, Ginger {lic'd, Horie- 
Radifh flicd, feme whole Muftard-Seed^ and 
three or four Cloves of Garlick > or if Garlick 
be too ftrong, as many Cloves of Shalots, 
Then lay upon thefe anotherLayer of Walnuts, 
and upon them the Roots and Spices as before, 
and fo continue till your Pot is full s then pour 
over the whole, as much boiling Vinegar as 
will cover them, and immediately cover the 
Pot clofe, and let it fland till the next Day, 
when we may again pour off the Vinegar from 
them, without difturbing them i and making 
it again boiling hot, pour it upon them, and 
flop them clofe, as before, to be fet by for ufe. 
But thefe will not be fit for eating under three 
Weeks or a Month, and will be much better 
by keeping a few Months, 

This Month is a proper time to make Sy- 
rup of Clove-Julyflowers , and likewife to 
make Julyflower Wine, which is a very 
rich Liquor, and may be made in the beft 
manner, by the following Receipt from Mrs. 
B. B. 

To make Julyflower Wine, 

-npAKE nine Gallons of Water, and twenty 

-*- four Pounds of Su2;ar, boil thefe on a 

gentle Fire till one Gallon is lofl, or evapo- 

rated, taking off the Scum as it rifes. Then 

having prepared a Bufhcl of Clove Julyflowers,

the red Flower Leaves only, pour the Liquor 
fcalding hot upon them, and coVer them clofc 
till the next Day, t.ien prcffing thcni with a 
Screw-pJxTs, When this is done, bake a piece 
of Bread hard, without fcorching, before the 
Fire,* and while it is warm, fpread fome Ale- 
Yead upon it, and put it into the Liquor, in an 
open Tub, till it begins to work or ferment s 
the next Day after which, add two quarts of 
Sack, and one of R/jemflo Wme, and barrel 
it for three Weeks or a Month , let it then 
be botrled, and kept in a cool Place. 

In this Month fuch Curp and Tench arc 
good as have not lately fpawn'd j the dreffing 
of them, and of Pikes, or Jacks, fee in March, 
Perch are now very good, the large ones for 
ftewing, as recommended for Carp, or boiled 
or fry'd, or clfein the Stitch manner, call'd 
Water Soochy ; which is to boil the Perches 
with Salt in the Waier, and Parflcy-Roots and 
Parfley-Leaves, to be brought to Table in the 
Water they are boiled in, and eaten with Bread 
'and Butter. 'Tis an odd way to the Englifh, 
but is much admir'd by many Genlemcn who 
have travel rd. 

The Garden is now very rich in Eatables, as 
may befeeninmy Gardener's Kale?idarj punt- 
ed for Mr. Mears, 

The Tragopogon, or Goatsbeard, is now, as 
well as in the former Month, fit for boiling; 
it is in much requcft in Ibmc of the Weftern 
parts of England^ efpecially about Brijiol:, as 
iani infornVd, where the Country People call 

it 



Director. ioq 

it Trangompoop, or Crangompoop, a corrup- 
tion, as 1 fuppofe, from the true Name above 
written : This is eaten like Afparagus, and 
drefs'd the fame way, the part which is eaten 
is the bloflbmy Bud a little before it would 
flower, with about fix Inches of the Stalk to it. 

There are now Chickens, Pigeons, Ducks, 
and fome young wild Ducks, and Rabbets, 
which may not only make great Variety at a 
Table, to be drcft after the common plain 
way, but may alfo be made into elgant Difh- 
es, ^fter thefeveral manners mentionM in this 
WorK, if there is an occafion to entertain 
particular People of fine Tafte. 

The Ronceval and Mooretto Peafe, and 
Windfor l^zzns, are alfo good helps to a Table: 
I need fay nothing of their dreffing j but that 
1 am of opinion, that the W'mdfor Beans, 
when they are blanch'd, that is, boiled long c- 
nough till we can take off their Skins, and 
then put into large-neck'd Bottles, and orier'd 
as I have prefcrib'd for the pireferving of Peafe 5 
by this means I fuppofe they may be prefcrv'd 
niany Months : but we may defer this Experi- 
ment till the end oiSeptember^ to be try'd up- 
on the latter Crops, 

Near the Sea we have Mackrel in the heidit 
of perfcdion, and Mullet, Turbut, Herrings, 
Scare, and Soles, as alfo Lobfters and Crabs ; 
and in the Rivers, Salmon and Trout are dill 
good, and fome Cray-Fifh. 

'Tis now a proper Sealon to put up Rafp** 
berries, either in Sweetmeat, or to infufein

Brandy 5 but they muftbegathcr'd dry. There 
are certain People who know how to mix

Florence Wine, 

About Midftimmer is a proper time to put 
up a Boar for Brawn againft Chrijimas, or a- 
gainft the beginning oiT>ecember^ for then is 
the Seafon it fells bcft, and is chiefly in requeft, 
felling at that time for twelve Pence ^er 
Pound. 

For this end wefhould chufe an old Boar, 
for the older he is, the more horny will the 
Brawn be: We muft provide for this ufe a 
Prank, as the Farmers call it, which muft be 
built very ftrong to keep the Boar in. The 
fifrure of the Frank fhould be fomewhat like 
a Dog-Kennel, a little longer than the Boar, 
which we put up fo clofeon the Sides that the 
Boar cannot rum about in it, the Back of this 
Frank muft have a Aiding Board, to open and 
fnur at pleafure, for the convcniency of taking 
away the Dung, which fhould be done every 
Day. When all this is very fccure, and made 
as directed, put up your Boar, and take care 
that he is fo placed, as never to fee or even 
hear any HogSj for if he does, he will pine a- 
way, and lofe more good Flcfh in one Day 
than he gets in a Fortnight : He muft then be 
fed Vv^ith as many Pcafe as he will eat, ahd as 
much skinVd Milk, or flet Milk, as is neceffa^ 
ry for him. This method muft be ufed with 
him till he declines his Meat, or will cat very 
little of it, and then the Peafe muft be left 
a off. 



Director, hi 

off, and he muft be fed with Fade made of 

Barley Meal, made into Balls as big as large 

Hen-Eggs, and ftill the Skim-Milk continued, 

till you find him decline that likewife, at which 

time he will be fit to kill for Brawn 5 the Di- 

reftions for making of which, with the Pickle 

for it^ fee in the Month of "December, During 

the time he is thus feeding, great care muft be 

taken that he has always Meat before him, 

for negled in this will fpoil the whole De- 

fign. 

This is the way of feeding a Boar for Brawn, 
jbut I cannot help thinking 'tis a little barba- 
rous, andefpeciaily asthe Creature is by fome ^ 
People put in foclofeaPen, that as I hear, it 
cannot lie down all the while 'tis feeding ; and 
atlaft, confideringthe exp,ence of Food, Brawn 
is but an infipid kind of Meat : however, as 
fome are lovers pf it, it is neceffary to prefcribe 
the method which fhouid be ufed in the prepa- 
ring it. 

In this Month we have plenty of Artichokes, 
and it is a good Scafon to put them up for 
Winter ufe, to be ufed finiply, or to be put 
in Sauces, or in compound Diflies, they are 
eafily dried or pickled, to be kept, and if they 
are not gatherd as foon as they are in their 
perfedion, they will lofe the goodnefs of 
their Hearts, or the Botroms, as fome call 
them. In a plentiful Year of them I have had 
a great number dried for Winter ufe^ in the 
following manner. 

Con- 



1 1 2 The Country Ladfs 

Concerning the gathering-, and ordering Arti-^ 
chokes for drying. 

IN the gathering of Artichokes, obftrve, that 
the Leaves of what is caird the Artichoke 
be pointing inwards, and lie clofe at the Top, 
for then the Bottom will be large and full -, but 
if you find many of the Leaves of the Arti- 
choke fprcad from the Top, then the Choke, 
or briftly part is fhot fo much, that it has drawn 
out much of thcHcartof the Artichoke^ and 
as the Flower comes forward, the more that 
grows, the thinner will be the Bottom, which 
is frhe beft part of it. 

When you cut the Artichoke, cut it with 
a long Stalk, that when you ufe it you may 
clear it well of its Strings, which will €i{z 
fpoil the goodnefs of the Bottom, wherein 
the Strings will remain j to do this, lay the Ar- 
tichoke upon a Table, and hold it down hard 
with one Hand, while with the other Hand 
you pull the Stalk hard up and down, till it 
quits the Artichoke, and will then pull away 
the Strings along with itj this being done, 
lay the Artichokes in Water for an Hour, and 
then put them into a Kettle of cold Water to 
boil, till they are tender enough to feparate the 
Leaves and the Chokes from them. When this 
is done, lay. the Hearts, or Bottoms upon a 
Cullender, or fome other thing, to drain con- 
veniently 5 then dry them upon a Wire Sieve, 
or Gridiron, in a gentle Oven, by degrees, 
till they arc as hard as Wood. Thefe will keep 

good 



Director. i i j 

good twelve Months if they are laid by in a 
dry Place. 

When we want to ufe thefe for boiling, 
frying, or to accompany other Meats, we muft 
put them into warm Water^ often repeating it 
10 them for eight and forty Ho^tts ; by which 
means they will come to themfelves, and be as 
good when they come to be fcaldcd as if they 
were frefh gathered. But they may alfo be 
preferv'd after the following manner. 

Second Way to preferve Artichokes, 

TT Aving chofcn your Artichokes according 
-*--*• to the above Diredions, cut the Bottoms, 
with a (harp Knife, clear of their Leaves and 
their Chokes, flinging them immediately into 
cold Water, to prevent their turning black. 
When they have lain in the Water for (^"^(^11 
or eight Minutes, wafh them and drain them 
a little, and then fling them into Wheat or 
Barley Flower, fo that they be all over covered 
with it 5 after which, lay them upon Wire- 
Sieves, or Pieces of Wicker-work to dry in 
an Oven gently, till they are quite dry and 
hard: thefe muft be kept in a dry Place, and 
when they are to be ufed, fteep them in 
Water four and twenty Hours, and boil them 
till they are tender, they will eat as well as if 
they were frefh cut. 

The Artichoke may likewife be pickled in 
the following manner. 

To 



114 The Country Ladfs 

To preferve Artichokes by Tickling. 

f^^ Athcr and prepare your Artichokes as be* 
^^ fore, and put them into cold Water to 
boil, with a moderate quantity of Salt ; then 
take them off the Fire, and let the Water 
ftandinthe Kettle for a quarter of an hour, 
till the Salt is fettled to the bottom 5 then 
pour off your Water clear into an Earthen 
glazed Veffel where you defign to put your 
Artichokes, and clearing them ftom the Leaves 
andChoaks, wafh them well in two or three 
Waters, and put them in the Brine or Pickle 
they were boiled in, when both are quite, cold ; 
upon which pour as much Oil as will cover 
it half an Inch thick, or where Oil is want- 
ing, melted Butter will ferve ; be fure you put 
fo much as will keep the Air from the-Arti- 
chokes. Some will add fome Vinegar to the 
Water, but that is at pleafure 5 when this is 
done, cover the top of the Earthen Pot ciofe 
with Paper, and lay a Board over it to keep it 
from any Air, or elfe cover the Pot with a 
wet Bladder, and tie it down clofe. They will 
keep good a Year, and when we want to ufe 
them, lay them to fteep in cold Water to take 
out the Salt 5 you may fliift the Water three or 
four times, they will be the better for it, and 
then ufe them in Pyes, or other compound 
Difhes. 

In Holland I have often eaten the fmall 
Suckers of Artichokes fry 'dp which have made 



D I R E c T o :ft. 115 

an agreeable Difii. The Receipt for preparing 
them is the following. 

To fry fmall Stickers of Artichokes j or fmall 

Artichokes. 

GAther the young Heads of Artichokes, and 
boil them with Salt and Water till they 
are tender $ thefe Artichokes fhould be no 
bigger thati middling Apples 5 fplit thefe in 
four or fix Parts each, flower them well, and 
fry them crifp in Hogs-lard, and eat them 
with Butter, Pepper, and a little Verjuice or 
Orange-Juice. ' 

It is a common praftice in France to eat 
the fmall Heads of Artichokes raw, with Vi- 
negar, Pepper, and Salt j the Method is to pull 
off the fingle Leaves, and dip the flelhy part 
of the Leaves into it and eat that. They are 
agreeably bitter, and create an Appetite. 

This Month Rasberries are ripe i arid as they 
make a moft pleafant Wine, I fhall here give 
the Receipt for making it. 

To make Rasberrj Wine. 

Tp O every Quart of the Juice of Rasber- 
-*- ries, put a Pint of Water, and to every 
Quart of Liquor a Pound of fine Sugar > then

then boil four Gallons of Cyder, and pour it 
boiling hot upon the Sugar and Goosbcrries : 
this muft , ftand eight or ten Days, ftirring it 
once each Day, and at length (train it thro' a 
Plannel in a Prefs, and put the Liquor into 
the Veffcl with a warm Toaft of Wheat- bread, 
fpread on both fides with Ale-Yeaft 5 this muft 
ftand two or three Months till it is fine, and 
then bottle it. This is a very ftrong Wine, 
and of a bright red Colour.

JUL T. 




HIS Month is the principal Seafon 
for pickling of Cucumbers, for that 
Fruit is now in the greatcft Perfedion, 
as well for pickling them in imitation 
of Mango's, or as Girkins. They are no\v to be 
had in great plenty, and are free from Spots. 

The follovjtng is an extraordinary i^eceipt for 
pickling ofCticumbers to imitate Mango's. 

Ather large Cucumbers of as green a Co- 
lour as may be, walli them well in com- 
mon Water, and then either cut off th^ir 
Tops, and fcoop out all the feedy part, or elfc 
cut a Slice out of the Side of each of them, 
and fcrape out the feedy part with a fmall 
Spoon, taking care not to mifmatch the Slices 
or Tops of the Cucumbers, that they may 
tie up the better when we come to fill them 
with Spices, (^c. When we have thus pre- 
pared enough to fill the Jar or Earthen Veffci 
which we defign for them, peel fome Garlick 
or Shalots, which you like beft, and put 
cither two Cloves of Shalot into each Cucum- 

I ber.

alfo into every one put a thin flice or two of

ing to cuftom, a Tea Spoonful of whok 
Muftard'feed 5 but, in my opinion, that may- 
be left out. Then putting on the tops of the 
Cucumbers, or the Slices that were cut out 
of them, tie them clofe with ftrong Thread, 
and place them in your Jar. Then prepare 
your Pickle of Vinegar, which we fuppofe to 
be about five Quarts to two dozen of large 
Cucumbers, to which put about a Pound of 
Bay-Salt, half an Ounce of whole Pepper, 
about an Ounce of Ginget fliced, and a large 
Root of Horfe-radilli fliced 5 boil thefe in 
a brafs Sauce-pan for about fifteen Minutes, 
taking off the Scum as it rifes, and then pour 
it upon your Cucumbers, and cover the top 
of the Veffel with a coarfe Linncn Cloth 
four or five times double, and ict the Veffci 
near the Tire to keep warm j the day follow- 
ing you will find them changed to a yellow 
Colour, but that will alter in a day or two to 
be much greener than they were at firft, if you 
ufe the following Method : Pour all your 
Pickle into a brafs Skellet, and add to it a 
piece of AUum as big as a Walnut, and fet it 
over the Fire till it boils, then pour it on your 
Cucumbers as before, and repeat the fame 
every day till the Cucumbers are of the 
Greennefs you defire. When you have pour'd 
on your Pickle for the laft time, the Jar muft 
^< covered as before, but remain without

Ather Cucumbers half grown, that is, be- 
fore they incline to be feedy, pat them ia 
Salt and Water for five or fix days, iliifting it 
every day 5 then wipe them dry, and put them 
in Vinegar with a little AUum to green over the 
fire; then take out the Cucumbers, and boil 
the pickle to pour hot upon them, covering 
the Mouth of the jar with, a coarfe Cloath 
four or five times doubled, and let the Jar 
(land near the fire. When this Pickle is 
quite cold, flop the Jar clofe with a Icathcr'd

two Inches4ong will do very well, or even one 
of three Inches. Thefe muft be put in Salt and 
Water, to be fhifted every day till they change 
to a yellow colour : wipe them dry, and prepare 
Pickle of Vinegar, a piece of Allum as big as 
a Wallnut to a gallon, or in proportion. 
Ginger iliced, Mace, whole Pepper, a few 
Bay-leaves, and fome Dill-Seed, which will do 
better than the Herb it felf. Tye the Seeds 
in a piece of Muflin, that when the Pickle by 
boiling is ftrong enough of the Dill, you may 
take it out. This Pickle, when it is of aright fla- 
vour, muft be pour'd boiling hot upon the Cu- 
cumbers, which muft belaid in a Stone ]ar or 
Gallypot proper for them, and then cover'd with 
a coarfe Linnen Cloth folded in feveral Doubles, 
and let them ftand near the fire : Repeat the 
boiling of the Pickle every day, pouring it hot 
upon the Cucumbers, and covering them as 
before, till they become of the green colour 
you dcfirc. When they are quite cold, flop 
them up clofe with a leathered Cork, as directed 
in the former Receipt, if you ufe ajar, or elfe 
if you make ufe of a Gallypot, tye them down 
with Leather or a wet Bladder. It is to be 
underftood, that Allum and boiling Vinegar 
will ftrike a green colour to any unripe Fruit 5 
but care muft be taken that too much Allum 
be not ufed, left the ftomach be offended by it.

the Capfictims fhould be boiled in Water gently,

the Cucumbers, where they muft be placed 
before the Pickle is poured upon them. 

Kidney-Beans are pickled the fame way as 
the Cucumbers, only leaving out the Dill 5 
and the Dill alfo may be left out of the Cu- 
cumber-Pickle, if it is not agreeable to the Pa- 
late 5 and folikewife in other Pickles, Garlick

out which is difagreeable, for it is not the bufi- 
nefs here to pin down the Palate of any one to 
a certain Relifli that I may like my felf, but to 
put it in the power of every one to prefcrve or 
order fuch things as a Farm or Garden affords, 
fo that they may be pleafed with them. The 
Receipts which I have here given, are what I 
have generally found to be the moft approved. 
We have fome who pickle the green Fruit of 
the Paflion-Tree, the Berougella, and Fig : 
but for my part I can find nothing to recom- 
mend them, but the relifh of the Pickle, neither 
are they by any means wholefome. 

The Flowers of the Najiurtium Indicum 
make an excellent Sallad in this Month, and 
the Seeds of the Plant, while they are green, 
may be pickled to our fatisfaftion : the Receipt 
for pickling them is as follows.

122 The Country Lady s 

To pickle Nafiurtium Seeds. 

/^^ Ather the Seeds when they are full grown 
^^ and srecn, in a dry day, and lay them in 
Salt and Water for two or three days 5 then 
boil Vinegar, with fome M^ce, Ginger fliced, 
and a few Bay-Leaves, for fifteen Minutes, and 
pour it boihng hot upon them, covering them 
With a Cloth, as prefcribed in this Month for 
the otiier Fickics, and repeat the boiling of the 
Pickle, and fcalding them with it for three 
days fucceffively J and when the laft is poured 
on, let it be cold before you cork it up. The 
folded Cloth which fhould be put over the 
Mouth of the Jar, will fufFer fome of the 
Steam of the Pickle to pafs thro' it, and by that 
means the Pickles will not turn mouldy, fo 
foonas they might othcrwife do, and befides 
will be much greener than if they were to be 
clofe flopped. All thefe Pickles fhould be 
kept in a dry Place, and look'd into every 
Month, led by chance they turn mouldy 5 
which if you find they incline to, boil the 
Pickle afrelTi, and pour it on them as before. 

There isnovv the Skerret fit to be catena 
it is a very nourifhingand pleafant Root, and 
is prepared in the following manner for the 
Table : the Culture of it is let forth at large 
in my new Improvements of Planting and 
Gardenings printed for Mr. MearSy near Tem- 
ple-Bar.* 

THE 



Director. 123 

THE Skerret;, tho' it is none of the largcft 
Roots, yet is certainly one of the befl 
Produds of the Garden, if it be rightly drefs'd 5 
the way of doing which, is to walh the Roots 
very well, and boil them till they are tender, 
which need not be very long. Then the Skin 
of the Roots muft betaken off, and a Sauce ot 
melted Butter and Sack pour'd over them. In 
this manner are they fervid at the Table, and 
eaten with the Juice of Orange, and iome 
likewifeufe Sugar with them, but the Pvoot Is 
very fweet of itfelf. 

Some, after the PvOOt is boil'd, and the Skin 
is taken off, fry them, and ufe the Sauce as 
above : Solikewifc the Roots ofSaifify and 
Scorzonera are to be prepared for the Table. 

The Apple call'd the Codlin is in good per- 
f wdion for fcalding, the manner of doing which, 
that they may be brought to Table, of a fine 
green Colour, is as follows. 

1^^ Ather your Codlins half grown, and with- 
^-*' out Spots, for if they are fpotted, they are 
commonly Worm-eaten 5 fcald them in Water 
till the Skin will come off eafily, then put them 
again into cold Water, and a fmall piece of 
Allum to green in a BrafsPan over the Fire; 
which they will foon do if they are kept dole 
covered. 

The following Receipt is fcnt me by a cu« 
rious Perfon for pickling of Codlins, in imi- 
tation of Mansio. 

I 4 Gather 



1^4 ^-^^ Country Lady's 

Gather Codlins green and near fiiii grown,

gar, three or four Cloves of Garlick, a quar- 
ter of an Ounce of Ginger fliced, and as much 
whole Pepper 5 boil this in a Brafs Pan, with 
2. piece of Allum as big as a Horfe-Bean, for 
half a quarter of an hour, and pour it hot 
upon your Codlins, covering the Mouth of 
the Jar with a Cloth, and let it ftand by the 
Pire-fide 5 boil the Pickle again the day fol- 
lowing, and apply it as before, arid repeat the 
fame till your Codlins are as green as you 
defire, and when they are quite cold, cork them 
clofc, and fet them by in a dry place. There 
is one thing muft however be obfervcd in all 
thefePicklin^s, which is, that if the Pickles 
do not come to their fine green Colour pre^ 
Icntly, br boiling often of the Pickle at firft, 
yet by ftanding three or four Weeks, and 
then boiling the Pickle afrefli, they will conic 
to a good Colour 5 and then your Pickles will 
cat the firmer and keep the longer, when they 
are not too foon brought to Colour. 

In this Adonth we have the Morcllo and 
Black Cherry ripe, which both arc pleafant 
in Brandy j to thofe who would have Drams 
by them, the way of making Black-Cherry 
Brandy, is only to pick the Cherries from 
the Stalks, and put them whole into the Bran-

young Pigs alfo are pretty plentifi^ *'tis a 
good time likewife to fave youn^Tigs to 
grow up, for now you may turn them with 
their Dams into the Stubbles, and foon after 
into the Woods. About the end of thisdl 
Month, you have Rabbets full grown in com- 
mon Warrens, and young wild Ducks i and 
thofe who live near the Sea, have plenty of 
Oyftcrs, and in great perfeftion, much better, 
in my opinion, than in the Winter. Hares 
are alfo no^^^od, and Buck Venifon is ftill 
good. Turnips^ Carres, Cabbages, Cauiyflow-

like, are in prime , Sallary and Endive, Na-

and profitable. 

Now Elder-berries are ripe and fit for ma- 
king of Wine, as well the white as the red 
fort : thefe are both very good, if they are 
ric/htiy m.annc;cd. The following drinks very 

much

much like the Fr^^ir^ Wine caird Hermitage, 
and is full as ftrong. 

To make red Elder Wine, 

npAke twenty Pounds of Malaga Raifms 
-*- pick'dand rubb'd clean, but not wafVd, 
fhrcd them fmall, and ftecp them in five Gal- 
lons of Spring Water, putting the Water 
cold to them, and ftirring them every day ; 
then pafs the Liquor thro' a Hair Sieve, prcf- 
fing the Raifms with your Hands, and have in 
readinefs fix Pints of the Juice of Elder-Berries 
that have been firft pick'd from the Stalks, and 
then drawn by boiling the Berries in a glaz'd 
Earthen Pot, fet in a Pan of Water over the 
Fire. Put this Juice cold into the Liquor, fiir- 
ring it well together, and then tunning it in a 
Veflel that will juft hold it, and let it ftand fix 
Weeks or two Months in a warm place j then 
bottle it, and it will keep a Year if the Bot- 
tles are w^ellftopp'd. Note, that the Eider-Ber- 
ries muft be full ripe, and gathered in a dry 
day ; and when you have tunn'd your Wine, 
let the place where you fet it be warm and dry, 
where no external Air is admitted, that it may 
ferment or work duly, for that is a material 
point. If it be othcrwife difpofed, fo that in 
ftands in a place which is fubjed to Heats and 
Cold, the Ferment will flop upon Cold, or be 
too violent upon Heats j burin cold Weather 
put fome Straw about it. Sec more of the 
working of Liquors m March j\x\ the Article 
of Brewing, and likewilc take care that your 

Boc- 



136 The Country Lady's 

Bottles are dry when you bottle your Wine, 
and that you have good Corks ; take care like- 
wife that your Wine be clear before you bottle 
it, or it will be good for nothing. If this 
Wine be rightly managed according to the 
above Direftions, it will be fit for drinking af- 
ter it has been bottled a Month. 

In the making of white Elder- Wine, therd 
is no difference if you make it with Raifins 5 
but it is much the beft, in my Opinion, if 
you make it with Sugar after the following 
manner : only it is to be confider'd, that 
white Elder-Berries are yet very fcarce, and 
there muft be more of them ufed in the Sugat 
Wine than in the Raifm Wine. 

To make white Elder-Winey or red Elder- 
JVinCy with Sugar. 

/'^Ather the Elder-Berries ripe and dry, pick 
^^ them, bruife them with your Hands, and 
ftrain themj then fet the Liquor by in glaz'd ear- 
then Veffels for twelve hours to fettle, then put 
to every pint of Juice a pint andhalf of Water, 
and to every Gallon of this Liquor put three 
Pounds of Lisbon Sugar : fct this in a Kettle 
over the Fire, and when it is ready to boil, 
clarify it with the Whites of four or five Eggs i 
let it boil an hour, and when itisalmoil 
cold, work it with fomeftrongAle-Yeaft, and 
then tun it, filling up the VefTel from time to 
time with the fame Liquor faved on purpofc, 
as it finks by working. In a Month's time, 

if 



Director. 131 

if the Veffel holds about eight Gallons, it will 
be fine and fit to bottle, and after bottling, 
will be fit to drink in two Months : but re- 
niember, that all Liquors muft be fine before 
they are bottled, or clfethey will grow fliarp 
and ferment in the Bottles, and never be good 
for any thing. 

N. B. Add to every Gallon of this Liquor a 
Pint of ftrong Mountain Wine, but not fuch 
as has the Borachio or Ho2;skin flavour. This 
Wine will be very ftrong and pieafant, and 
will keep feveral Years. 

We muft prepare our Red Elder- Wine in the 
fame manner that we make with Su2;ar, and if 
our Veflel hold about eight or ten Gallons, it 
will be fit for Bottling in about a Month ; but 
if the Veflel be larger, it muft ftand longer in 
proportion, three or four Months at leaft for a 
Ho2;fliead. 

This Month Barberries are ripe and fit for 
pickling 3 they make a pretty Garnifli, and arc 
prepared as follows.

as t>ood as the other. 

I—' 

Partridges arc now in Seafon, and are pre- 
pared after fcveral manners , fonae of the prin- 
cipal are the following. 

Boil'd ^Partridgjcs ijoith fteiSifd Sallarjfy from 
Lady W' — -. 

^T'HE Partridges being cleaned and truflcd, 
-^- boil them tender, and make the follow- 
ing Sauce for them. Take half a fcore large 
vSaJlaryPiants that are well whiten'd or blanched, 
boil them firft in Water and Salt, and then 
ftcw them tender with Gravey, Salt, fome Pep- 
per, and a Spoonful or two of White wine.; 
znd when they are enough, thicken and brown 
the Sauce they arc ftew'd in with burnt Butter, 
lav vour Sallarv at the bottom of the Difh, and 
your Partridges upon that, then pour your 
Sauce over all, and garnilh with Lemmon or 
Orange fiic'd. This is the method of ftewins; 
Sallarv, which is an asireeable Plate of itfelf. 

From the fame Lady I had the following 
Dircdions for roaftcd Partridges : Partridges 
which are defigncd for roafting may be larded 
with fine Bacon Fat on the Bread, or roafted 
without lardingi but in aDifn of thcfe Fowls, 
there fhould be fome of one and fomeof the 
other. The Sauce for them fliould be ot two

and Pepper, ftew'd half an hour together, in 
a little more Water than will cover them, then 
ftrain off the Liquor into the Difh. 

The Pap-Sauce, or Bread-Sauce, is made of 
grated Crumb of Bread, boiled with as much 
Water as will cover it, a little Butter, ah O" 
nion, and fonrie whole Pepper 5 this muft be 
kept ftirring often, and when it is very thick, 
v/ithdraw the Onion, and ferve it in a Saucer 
with your Partridges* Thefe Sauces may like- 
wife be ferved with Pheafarits, or Quails. Thefc 
may alfo be ftew'd, farced, baked, or put in 
Soups, or ufed in FricalTees. Thus far the 
Lady. 

Hares begin new to be in Seafon, and arc 
well drcfs'd by the following Receipt, which 
I purchaf^^d a few Years ago, at a noted Tavern 
in London. 

A Hate and its Sauces, 

T F you kill a Hare by Courfing, you may 
•■' keep it if the Weather be cool three days 
before you roaft it 5 or if it has been run hard 
by the Hounds, then it will not keep fo long* 
When the Skin is taken off, it is the fafliion 
to leave the Ears on, but that is at pleafure i 
then trufs it for Roafting, and take the Liver 
and boil it, and mince it very fmall j add to this

it 5 then fill the Body of the Hare moderately 
with this Farce, and few up the Belly. When 
the Hare is firft laid down to the fire, put about 
thrcV pints of Water with an Onion, fomc Salt 
and \isholePepper, in the Dripping-pan, and bade 
the nVre with this till it is near roafted enough, 
and bade it with apiece of fat burning Bacon, or 
in the place of that, common Butter 5 but the 
Bacon is beft, if the Perfon knows how to ufe ir. 
When it is enough, pour the following Sauce 
into the Difh with it : Take the Liquor, with 
the Onion and Pepper in the Dripping-pan, out 
before you bafte the Hare with Butter or Bacon, 
and boil it with a glafs of Claret i it will be 
Very rich when it comes to be mixt with the 
Farce out of the Belly of the Hare, and is little 
trouble. You may thicken this with a little 
Butter and Flower, if you plcafe. 

The following is alfo a very good one : Take 

a pound of lean Beef, boil it in about three 

pints of Water wuth an Onion, a Bunch of 

iweet Herbs, fome AU-fpice, Pepper and Salt, 

till the Beef is boil'd half enough 5 then cut the 

Beef in feveral places to let out the Gravey, and 

continue to boil all-^ofe till the Liquor has 

loft a third part i then add a little Claret to ir, 

and ftrain the Liquot through a Sieve, pouring 

the Gravey hot into the Di(h before you put 

the Hare in it 5 and whenyou lay in the Hare,cut

This is an excellent way of drefling a Hare^ 
and more generally admired than any other. 

This being the Seafon for taking Honey, 
I fliall here fet down the Method of making of 
Mead, after two ways, which are both extra- 
grdinary. 

To make Mead, from Lady G. 

A K E eight Gallons of Water, and as 
much Honey as will make it bear an Egg > 
add to this the Rind of fix Lemmons, and boil 
it well, fcumming it carefully as it rifes. When 
'tis off the Fire, put to it the Juice of the fix 
Lemmons, and pour it into a cleanTub, or open 
earthen Veflel, if you have one large enough, 
to work three Days j then fcum it well, and 
pour off the clear Into the Cask, and let It 
ftand open till it has done making a hiffing 
Noife 5 after which, flop it up clofe, and in 
three Months time it will be fine, and fit for 
bottlingc 

To make Hydromety or Mead, 

TAKE eight Gallons of Water, and as 
much Honey as will make theWater bear 
an Egg 5 put to this a quarter of a pound of 
Cloves tied in three or four pieces of Muflin 
or Linnen Cloth, and fet it to boil till the Scum 
has done rifmg, fcumming it as it riles 5 then 
take it off the Fire, and take out the Cloves, 
which may be wafh'd and dry^d for other Ufes, 
and pour your Mead into an open Tub to fer- 
ment 



Director. 137 

ment for about three days, till the Violence 
of the Working is over; after which, fcumit 
very well, and pour the clear into a VclTel, 
leaving the Bung open till it has done hilling, 
which you may know by holding your Ear 
clofe to it, for at a diftance you can hardly 
difcover it. When this hiiling is over, flop it 
clofe, and let it (land three Months till it is 
fine, before you bottle it 5 remember in bot.- 
tlingthis, as well as all other Liquors, tnatthe 
Bottles muft be clean, and perfedly dry, and 
that every Bottle be well cork'd. This will 
keep good feveral Years. 

Befides this way of making Mead, there is 
another which 1 have approved to be very 
good, which, in all particulars, except theWa- 
ter, is the fame with thisj and inftead of the 
Water, put the like Quantity of fmall Ale- 
Wort, b^ew'd with pale Malt : but this will re- 
quire iefs Honey than the former, and will re- 
quire more time in the Veffel before it is fine 
and fit to bottle j but it will laft many Years 
good, and will drink like Cyprtis Wine when 
it is a Year old. In this Liquor, take particular 
care that your Cloves are frefhand found, for 
elfe you muft add a Quantity in proportion, 

i\Z'.5.WemaymakethefeMeadsintheSpring 
of the Year, as well as at this Seafon 5 only the 
advantage of making it now, is, that you have 
an opportunity of wafhing the Honey-Combs 
after the Honey is run off, and thereby will 
fave Expence in Honey.

The Potatoe now begins to be gathered, and 
is a very ufcful Root, being either boii'd or 
roafted in hot Embers ; and after it is boiled, 
to be broiled, or after boiling it tender> and 
beaten in a Mortar, it is ufed to thicken Sauces, 
and for makins; of rich Puddings, as I am in- 
form'd by a skilful Perfon in this way. 

The Roots of red Beets now begin to come 
in feafon, andare very good boiled, and diced, 
to be put in a Pickle of Vinegar only: thus 
you may keep them to garnifh Sallads of fmall 
Herbs, and in fomc Intervals put Horfe-Ra-

To fry the Roots of Red Beets. 

VST ASH your Beet-Roots, and lay them in

part of an Inch ; dip thefe in a thick Batter, 
made of White-Wine, fine Flower, fweet 
Cream, the Whites and Yolks of Eggs, rather 
more Yolks than Whites, fome Pepper, Salt,

In the Heats of this Month, the following 
Jelly is ufed by a curious Gentleman abroad, 
who gave me the Receipt of it, under the 
Name of The Jelly of Health : It is of great 
ufe to weak People, and extremely pleafant.

with a proportionable Quantity of Water, par- 
ticularly taking off the Scum as itrifes. When 
thefe Meats are boiled almoft to pieces, it is a 
fign that your Jelly is boiled enough i but take 
care that it is not too ftiff, which you may 
try by taking a little out with a Spoon, and 
then fetting it to cool. Then pour the Li-

a proportionable Quantity of double-refined

three or four Cloves, and the Rinds of two or 
three Lemmons : boil all thefe together gently 
for about a quarter of an hour, till it is well- 
tafted, and then beat up the Whites of four

SEPTEMBER. 




S this Month produces great num- 
bers of Muflirooms in the Fields, 
it is now chiefly that we ought to 
provide ourfelves with them for 
making of Ketchup, and Mufhroom Gravey : 
And it is alfo a proper Seafon for pickling them. 
Indeed, where we have Mufhroom- Beds, we 
may do thefe Works at any time of theYear. It 
is to be remarked, that the beft Mufhrooms have 
their Gills of a Flefh Colour, even while the 
Mufhrooms are in button ; and as they tend to 
fpread in their Head, or to open their Cap, 
the Gills turn redder, till at length, when their 

Heads 



Director. 141 

Heads are fully fpreadopen, they will become 
quite blacL Thefe large-flap Mufhrooms are 
ftill good for ftewing or broiling, fo long as 
they have no Worms in them, and the Gills 
are then in the beft ftate for making Ketchup, 
or Mufhroom-Gravcy s altho' the red Gills will 
do, but the fmaller Buttons are what moft 
People covet for Pickling. 

In the gathering of Mufhrooms, we are fure 
to meet with fome of all fizes 5 the very fmall 
for pickling, the large Buttons for ftewing or 
making Mulhroom-Loaves, and Mufhroom- 
Gravey, and the large Flaps for broiling or 
making of Ragous, or ftewing, and Ketchup : 
therefore to follow the common way, we 
fhouldmake two or three Parcels of them. 

The cleaning of Mufhrooms, or preparing 
them for any of the above Ufes, will aiford 
us nothins: but what is ufefulj the Parings 
fhould be faved by themfelves, to be wafh'd, 
towards the making of what is called Mufh- 
room-Gravey 3 the Gills muft be faved by them- 
felves for making either Ketchup, or Mufh- 
room-Gravey 3 and the Parts towards the Roots, 
and the Roots themfelves, muft be kept to dry 
in the Sun, or a warm Room, to raife Mufh^ 
rooms from, efpecially if they are of a large 
good fort that has red Gills, forthofe which 
have white Gills, prove oftentimes unwhole- 
fome, and are apt to turn yellow when they 
are cut and put in Water : however, fome 
People eat of this fort, and I have eaten of 
fuch a fort myfelf $ but as there are fome with 

white 



^42" The Country Lad/s 

white Gills that are deadly, it is dangerous 
for unskilful Pcrfons to meddle with any of 
that fort : and therefore I thought it conve- 
nient when I wzs'm France^ to learn the Me- 
thod of raifing them in Beds, that we mi^ht 
be fure of our fort, and have them all "the 
Year about: The Method of doing which, is 
in my Appendix to my New Improvements 
of Planting and Gardening, printed for 
Mr. MearSy at Temple- Bar. 

The following Receipts for making of 
Mufhroom-Ketchup, and Mufhroom-Gravey, 
I had from a Gentleman named Garneau, 
whom I met at BruffelSy and by Experience 
find them to be very good. 

To make Mufbroom Ketchup. 

T^AKE the Gills of large Mulhrooms, fuch 
■^ as are fpread quite open, put them into 
aSkelletof Bell-Metal, or a Veffel of Earthen- 
Ware glazed, and fet them over a gentle Fire 
till they begin to change into Water j and then 
frequently ftirring them till there is as much 
Liquor come out of them as can be cxpeded, 
prcfiing them often with a Spoon againft the 
fide of the Vcflel $ then drain off the Liquor, 
and put to every Quart of it about eighty 
Gloves, if they are frefh and good, or half as 
many more, if they are dry, or have been kept 
a long time, and about a Drachm of Mace : 
add to this about a Pint of ftrong red Torf 
Wine that has not been adulterated, and boil 
them all together till you judge that every Quart 
z has 



Director. 143 

has loft about a fourth Part or half a Pint 5 then 
pals it thro' a Sieve, and let it ftand to cool, 
and when it is quite cold, bottle it up in dry 
Bottles of Pints or Half-Pints, and cork them 
clofe, for it is the furcft way to keep thcfe kind 
of Liquors in fuch fmall quantities as may be 
ufed quickly, when they come to be expofed 
to the Air, for fear of growing mouldy : but I 
have had a Bottle of this fort of Ketchup y 
that has been op end and fet by for above a 
Tear, that has not received the leaft Damage 5 
and fome Acquaintance of mine have made of 
the fame fort, and have kept it inQuart-Bot- 
les to ufe as occafion required, and have kept 
it good much longer than I have done. A lit- 
tle of it is very rich in any Sauce, and efpe- 
cially when Gravey is wanting : Therefore 
it may be of fervice to Travellers, who too 
frequently meet with good Fi(h, and other 
Meats, in Britain, as well as in feveral other 
parts of Europe, that are fpoiled in the dref- 
iing ; but it muft be confider'd, that there is 
no Salt in this, fo that whenever it is ufed, 
Salt, Anchovies, or other fuch like relifhing 
things, niay be ufed with it, if they are agree- 
able to the Palate, and fo likewife with the 
Mufnroom Gravey in the following Receipt, 

Of Mufliroom Gravey. 

TT7H E N you clean your Mufhrooms, favc 

^' the Parings, and wafh them well from 

the Dirt, and then put to them the Gills that 

have been fcraped from the large Buttons, and 

with 



144 The Country Ladfs 

with a vei-y little Water put them in a Sauce- 
pan, and ftir them frequently till you have 
got all the Juice from them \ then ftrain the 
Liquor from them, and fet it \pj to cool, or 
clfe till you have ftew'd the Muflirooms that 
they were taken from, and then add the Li- 
quor of the ftew'd Mufhrooms to the aforefaid 
Liquor, and boil them both together, with a- 
bout 80 Cloves, about a Drachm of Mace, and 
two Drachms of whole Pepper to each Quart 
of Liquor, which will be tit to takeoff the 
Fire when it has loft about a third part by 
boilings then pafs it thro' a dry '^\t^(^^ into a 
dry earthen Pan, and let it ftand till it be 
quire cold before you bottle it, obferving 
then that the Bottles be very dry, for if they 
happen to be wet, it will foon turn mouldy. 
When the Bottles are fiird, cork them well 
with found new Corks, and tye a piece of 
Bladder, that has been foftened in warm Wa- 
ter, over every Cork as tight as pofliblc, and 
{<iX. the Bottles \n a dry Place 3 with this ma- 
nagement it will keep a long time. 

What I learned elfe from the above men- 
tion'd Gentleman, concerning the preparing 
of Mufnrooms for eating, was, that they fliould 
be always ufed when they are frefli gathered, 
and then only fuch as are without Worms, 
which may be eafily perceived by cutting their 
Stems crofs-wife J and alfo that as foon as the 
Peel is pared off, and the Gills, let the large 
Mufhrooms be cut into pieces, of the bignefs 
of Nutmegs^ and thrown into Water, as well

the Steins as the G^s, for they are both 
good ; then wafli them well, and ftew them 
in a Sauce-pan, without putting any Liquor 
to them, or Spice, or Salt, till they have dif- 
charged a great deal of their own Liquor, and 
begin to grow tender, you will then find 
them fhrink into a very narrow compafs, and 
muft have the greateft part of the Liquor 
poured from them, with which you may make 
the Mufhroom-Gravey abovementiorLd. The 
Muflirooms being thus prepared, put to them 
a Seafoning of Pepper, Salt, Mace, and fuch 
other Ingredients as will not rob the Mufli- 
rooms too much of their own natural Flavour, 
andftir them frequently till they are enough 5 
then put a little White-wine and Butter to 
them, and they will make an excellent good 
Diffi : or elfe they may be made brown with 
fome burned Butter, or be made into a Ra- 
gout. As for the broiling of the Caps of 
the largs Muflirooms, the fame Perfon's 
Rece^ipt duefts to rub the Caps with But- 
ter on both fides, and ftrew Pepper and 
Salt on them, and broil them till they are 
quite hot through, turning them two or three 
times on the Fire, they will make their own 
Sauce when they come to be cut Another 
way which he direds, is to make a pretty 
thick Batter of Flower, Water, or Milk and 
Eggs beaten together with fome Salt and Pep- 
per, to dip them in, and then fry them like 
Tripe j and for their Sauce, he recomme;nds 
Butter^ a little White- wine, and fome of the 

I Mufli- 



I4<5 The Country Lad/s 

Mufhroom-Gravey, to be well mix'd toge- 
ther. 

Some of my Acquaintance, who have try*d 
thcfe Diredions, approve of them ; and, for 
iriy own part, I think them as agreeable as 
any that I have eaten : but as the Tafte is 
not alike in every one, I fhall add an Ob- 
fervation or two more of Monfieur Garneatis, 
concerning the Mufhroom, which I think not 
unworthy our notice. The Mufhroom, fays 
that Gentleman, is not only a good Ground- 
work for all high Sauces, but itfclf a good 
Meat to be drefs'd after any manner, either 
to compofe a white or brown Fricaffee, or 
fry'd or broil'd, or baked in Pyes with com- 
mon Seafoning, and (lands in the room of 
Flefh better than any thing that has yet been 
found out. 

This Month is likcwife a good time, if 
it is not over-wet, to gather Mufhroooms for 
drying; but they fhould chiefly be luch as 
are newly opcn'd in their Caps, before the 
Gills turn black. For this end, take off the 
Gills very clean, ;^nd wipe the Caps with wet 
Flannel, and as foon as they are a little dry, 
run a String through them, and hang them at 
fome diftance from the Fire, turning them now 
and then till they are dry enough to be reduced 
to Powder. When they are thus dry'd, keep 
them in dry Bottles with wide Necks, clofe 
ftopp'd, till you have occafion to ufe them in 
Sauces. Keep this in a dry place. Some 
dry them in Ovens after the Bread is drawn,

but an Oven in its full heat will be too ftrong 



To pickle Mufbrooms White. 

TAke a Quart of fmall Buttons of Mufh- 
rooms, cut off their Roots, and wa(h 
them well with a Flannel dipt in Water, and 
then fling them into clean Water, to remain 
there about two hours. In the next place, get 
ready Tome frefh Water in a well-tinn'd Vef- 
fcl, or glaz'd Veflel, to which put your Mufli- 
rooms, and let them boil a little to foften 5 
which being done, take out your Mufhrooms, 
and prefently put them into cold Water, and 
let them remain there till they are quite cold j 
after this, free them from the Water, and dry 
them well in a linnen Cloth, then put them 
cither into a wide-neck'd Bottle, or glaz'd 
Earthen- VefTel, difpofing here and there a- 
mong them three or four Bay-leaves to a 
Quart, two Nutmegs cut in quarters, about a 
quarter of an Ounce of Mace, and boil as much 
White- Wine and Vinegar, in equal quanti- 
ties, as will ferve to cover the Mufhrooms. 
This Pickle muft be put to them cold, 
and the Bottle, or Earthen-VelTel, clofe 
ftopt and ty'd down with a wet Bladder. 
The reafon why the Spice (hould not be 
boiled with the Pickle, is, becaufe the Mufli- 
rooms would change black by means of the 
boird Spices ; and if this plain Pickle was to 
be pour'd upon the Mufhrooms hot, it would 
immediately draw a Colour from the Spices, 

which

1 4 S The Country Ladfs 

which would darken the Colour of the Muffi-- 
roomj, : therefore to fill up the glaffcs in the 
manner here related, is the beft way to have 
your Mufhrooms look clean and white. 

This Month is the proper time to pickle ^ 
Onions, which make an agreeable Pickle if 
they are prepared after the following manner. 

To pickle Onions y from Mrs. A. W. 

\Jif HEN your Onions are dry enough to be 
^^ laid up in the Houfe, take the fmalleft 
of them, fuch as are about the bigneis of a 
fmall Walnut, and of that fort which we 
call the Spanijh Onion, for thefe are not fo 
ilrong flavoured as the Strasburgh Onions j^ 
take off only the outward dry Coat, and boil 
them in one Water without flhifting, till they 
begin to grow tender j then take them off the 
Fire, lay them in a Sieve or CiiUendar to drain 
and cool 5 and as foon as they are quite cold, 
takeoff two other Coats or Skins from each, 
and rub them gently in a linnen Cloth to dry. 
When this is done, put them into wide-mouth'd 
GlalTes, with about fix or eight frefh Bay- 
leaves to a Quar% a quarter of an Ounce of 
Mace, two large Rafes of Ginger fliced. All ; 
thefe Ingredients muft be interfperfed here and 
there in the Glafles among the Onions, and 
then boil your Vinegar with about two Oun- 
ces of Bay-Salt to each Quart, taking off the

About the end of this Month, if the Sea^ 
fon has been tolerable, the Grapes in our 
£;2^///6 Vineyards will be ripe, and then we 
muft be careful to gather them in dry Wea- 
ther, that the Wine may keep the better. I 
have already mention'd> in my other Works, 
the curious Vineyard near £^/^, and that be- 
longing to Mr. John Warner at Rotherhith-^ 
where good Wines are made every year i and 
alfo that at T>arking in Surrey, belonging to 
Mt, Howard, which is a very good one : but 
as fome years are lefs favourable than others 
to the Grape, as well with us as abroad, it will 
not be unneceffary to take notice of a few 
Particulars, which I have obferv'd this year 
1726, concerning the management of Vines, 
which I have only communicated to a few. 
I fhall alfo fet down a few Dircdions for the 
making of Wine> which have not been hi- 
therto mention d in any of my Works, or by 
Mr. Evelyn^ or Mr* Mortimer, 

As to the firft, we are to obferve, that the 
Situation of our Ifland occafions our Seafons 
to be more uncertain than on the Continent, 
or between the Tropics. The cold and wee 
Summer, 1725, prevented the ripening of 
our later kind of Grapes i and indeed I did not 
meet any where with a Grape that had its per* 
fed Flavour, unlefs the Vines were forced s 
but yet there were abundance. However, this 
Year, 1726, on the contrary, there are very 

L few 



1 5 o The Country Lad/s 

few Grapes, and thofe arc likely to be vcfy 
good, fome being already ripe againft common 
Walls, without Art 5 fuch as the wbke Mufca-* 
dine the 24th of July, and black Clufter-Grape. 
And at Sir Nicholas Garrard's Garden in 
EJfex, I cat fome of the black Frontiniack -^jj 
full in pcrfeftion, at the fame time 5 and then ' 
thegrilly and white jFr^;^^/«/^f^ Grapes, which 
are the lateft kinds, were tranfparent, and 
within a little of being fit to gather : which 
is a Novelty fo great, that has not been ob- 
ferv'd in England in my time 5 for the 
Frontiniack Grapes feldom ripen till the 
end of September y and th^n in a bad Year 
we cannot expeft them without Art. How- 
ever, the Vines in this worthy Gentleman's 
Garden are of long (landing, and have been> 
by his own Diredions, ordered and manag d in 
a very artful manner for feveral Years. And 
tho' this Year generally we find fo fmail a 
quantity in other Gardens, yet at this place 
there are as many as I judge are in the whole 
County bcfides. In moft otherplaces that I have 
obfsrv'd this Year, the common way of ma- 
nagement has been rather regarded than the 
rational part 5 and even the beft Gardeners 
have faird in their Pruning the laft Year, for 
the produdion of this Year's Fruit. I much 
wonder, that after the Demonftrations I have 
l^iven from Fads,ever fince the Year 1717? that 
Vines would grow and profper well to be planted 
in old dry Walls i and the Inftances I publifh'd

occafion an alteration in a Plant. There is one 
Inftancc particularly, which I cannot help men- 
tioning, relating to Vines, andthe neceffity of 
keeping their Roots from Wet, which I ob- 
ferv'd this Year at Twittenham, at John Ro- 
barts's Efq. This Gentleman has feveral Vines 
laid up againft the fide of his Houfc, as full of 
Grapes as I have ever feen any 5 but at the 
bottom where they grow, the Ground is paved 
with Bricks for about ten or twelve foot from 
the Wall they are nail'd to. This Pavement, in 
the laft wet Summer, kept the Roots from 
imbibing, or receiving too much Moifture, 
and therefore the Juices of the Vines were di- 
gefted, and capable of producing Fruit this Year$ 
whereas fuch Vines as were not growing in 
dry places naturally, or had their Roots de- 
fended from the violent Wet by accident, have 
few or no Grapes at all, My Obfervations

this Year, in fome places where there are 
Pavements, (iill confirms me in myOpinioHi 
and where there was any tolerable Skill in 
Pruning, I am perfuaded every one will find 
that there have been Grapes this Year, or now 
are on thofe Vines that have flood in paved 
places, where the Pavcmentdefcnded the Roots 
from the wet of the laft Year. And as I have 
already mentioned in this, and other Works,

for regular Seafons ; and thefe Inftances fhew- 
ing us the advantage of doing the fame in wet 
Seafons 5 I think one may reafonably judge, 
that Pavements made over fuch places where 
Vines are planted, as well as Rubbifh and dry 
Ground to plant them in, is the beft way wc 
can take for them. This way, particularly in 
a wet Year, will keep our Vines from running 
into long Joints, and the Juices confequently 
in digcfting, as we find by experience 3 for no 
long-jointed Shoots of Vines are fruitful as 
they ought to be, and rarely bear any Fruit 
at all. Tis the fhort-jointed Shoots that will 
bear Fruit plentifully $ and where there is 
much Wet at the Root, you muft expeft very 
few fhort Joints, and alfo very, little Fruit : 
therefore, in this cafe, the Roots ought al- 
ways to be defended from Wet. 

This Year, 1726, was, at the beginning, a 
gentle and moid Spring, but April and May 
were hot 5 which brought every thing fo for- 
ward, that our Harveft was about five or fix 
Weeks forwarder than it has been for fcveral 

Years

Years paft. The Cafe I have mcntion'd of 
the Grapes ripening naturally, was in propor- 
tion to the forwardnefs of the Marvefti every 
thing that 1 have obferved in the fame way 
*^ was alike. The laft Year was as extraordinary 
in the latenefs of Crops, for then everything 
was as backward through the perpetual Rain 
we had in the Summer. Some time or other 
this Memorandum may be of ufc, if my Pa- 
pers laft fo long ; however, for the prefcnt, 
confider how thefe two different Years have 
affeded the Vine ,• the laft wet Year made the 
Vines fhootftrong and vigorous, and there was 
no Fruit this Year : nor was this only with us 
in Britain^ but every where m Europe. The 
laft Year produced fuch Floods, from the con- 
tinued Rains at unexpeded Seafons, as was 
never known in the memory of Man, the 
Vines fhot vigorouflyj and this Year there 
were very few Grapes of the firft Crop : but 
this Summer was fo good and favourable, by 
its warm Months at the beginning of the Sum- 
mer, that the Vines abroad fhot oat frefh 
Crops, or fecond Crops of Grapes, which 
made up for the other deficiency. I expeft 
the next Year from hence, that the Vines will 
produce a full Crop of Grapes abroad, be- 
caufe this Year has fettled the Juices, anddi- 
gefted them 5 but what Seafon there may be 
for ripening, is ftill uncertain, efpccially when, 
v/c have the two laft Years in view.> But in 
our Ga,vdens, I fear, we fhall havcworfe fuc* 
ceil 5 for what this Year has dohe, will give 

L I , the 



154- The Country Ladfs 

the Gardeners generally a hard piece of work? 
for, as I imagine, there was little care taken 
in the beginning of the Year to lay up the 
Vines, efpecially becaufe there wasbutafmall, 
or no appearance of Grapes then 5 and the 
jnegled of that Seafon in managing of Vines, 
will be the occafion of lofing the Crop the 
jnext Year. What I fay here about the ma- 
nagement of Vines in the early part of the 
Year, I have already treated of in my other 
Works. 

I fliall now proceed to give fome Particu- 
lars relating to the making of Wines of Grapes, 
which I believe may help thofe who make 
Wines in our Englifh Vineyards, and make 
them ftronger and richer than they have ufu-^ 
ally been. 

Confidering the uncertainty of Seafons, and 
that every fort of Grape will not always ri- 
pen without Art, it will be necelTary to con- 
trive how that Defeft may be amended. The 
Richnefs of Wine depends upon the Ripenefs 
of the Grapes ; and therefore when Grapes 
have not had the advantage of a favourable 
Seafon to ripen, the Liquor prefs'd from the 
Grapes, maybe amended by boilings for this 
extraordinary Heat will corred the Juice, by 
evaporating the two great quantity of watery 
parts. This Method, however ripe the Grapes 
were among the znticnt Greeks 2ind Romans, 
was frequently, if not always praftifed ; and 
if pradifed in thofe more Southern Climes, 
why is it not as reafonable in ours? But 

that 



Director: 155 

that this IS not now praftifed any where in 
Europe-, is no reafon why Wines may not be 
the better for it. I fuppofe the only reafon 
why it is not now pradifed, is, becaufe it 
would be an Expence and Trouble, more than 
the Mafters of Vineyards have ufually been at ^ 
and fo long as they can fell their Wines at a 
conftant Price, they do not care to go out of 
the way ; but in a bad Seafon there is no doubt 
but even the Wines in France might be me- 
liorated by boiling : As in the Inftance of 
the Front iniack Grapes, that are four and un- 
ripe, and without Flavour, yet, by boiling or 
baking, they will gain the high JFlavour that 
is found in them when they arc well-ripen d, 
by the Sun 5 but in baking or boiling unripe 
Grapes in the Skins, one muft expect that the 
fournefs of the Skins will communicate a four- 
nefs to thejuiccs enclofed ; but the juices be- 
ing prefs'd and boird, will ripen and become 
pleafant. In my New Improvements ofTlant- 
ing and Gardening, I have given large Direc- 
tions for making of Wine of Grapes, and in this, 
have alfo given variety of Receipts for making 
of Wines of Fruits of our own growth 5 from 
whence we may learn the Ufe of boiling Jui- 
ces of Fruits, and what will require fermenting 
by Yeaft, and what do not. You will find that 
fuch Wines as are boiled with Sugar, are to be 
fermenred with Yeaft ; and fuch as have Rai- 
fms for their foundation, will ferment in fonic 
meafure of themfelvcs. And efpecially ob- 
serve, that while any Liquor is fermenting, 

L 4. the 



15 6 The Country Ladfs 

the Veffel it is cnclofed in muft be kept open 
till it has quite done working , for if we fhould 
flop it up before that Action is over, it will 
certainly burft the Veffel j or if it has room 
enough, will turn four, and be always thick 
^nd troubled. Again, all Wines, and other 
Liquors, muft be ftopt clofc as foon as they 
have done working, or elfe the Liquors will 
grow flat and dead. Some Wines will fer- 
ment fix Weeks or two Months after they are 
in the Veffel, as one may know by the hilling 
noife which they make , but when that is done, 
then the ferment is over, and they fhould be 
clofedup. But fome Wines will ferment much 
longer than two Months^ and then it is a fign 
that they ftand too hot 5 then they muftbeput 
in a cooler place, ortheoutfide of the Veffel 
frequently cooi'd or refrcfh'd with Water, 
which will flop the ferment. Again, fome will 
not ferment as they ought to do, and then 
thcymuft be fet in: warmer places, which will 
raife the ferment. 

In very bad Years wc may help our Wines 
with a fmall quantity of Sugar, perhaps a Pound 
to a Gallon of Juice, to boil together 3 but 
whether we add Sugar or no, wc muft be furc 
to take the Scum off the Wines as it rifes when 
they arc boiling. 

In the colder Climates, we ought not to 
prefs the Grapes fo clofe as they do in the hot 
Countries, becaufe in the colder parts of the 
World, and in places the mod remote from 
the Sun, the Skins of the Grapes arc much 

thicker. 



Dl RE CTO R^ 157 

thicker, and carry a Sournefs in them which 
fhould not be too much prefs'd to mix with 
the richer part of the Grape i but in the hot- 
ter Climes, the Skins of the Grapes are thin, 
and the Sournefs reftify'd by the Sun, and 
will bear preffing without injuring the finer 
Juices. 

There is one thing which I fhall mention 
with regard to the Endeavours that have been 
ufed to make Wine in the Ifland of St. He- 
lena-^ a Place fo fituate, that it lies as a refting- 
place between thefe Northern Parts, and the 
Eaft'IndieSy and lb remote from other places, 
that could there be good Wine made there, it 
would be of great help and afliftance to the 
Ships that f^that way : But I am informed 
by a curious Gehtleman, who has had many 
good Accounts of that Place, that the Vines 
which have been planted there, are of fuch 
forts, as bring the Grapes ripe and rotten on 
one fide of the Bunch, and green on the other 
at the fame time, which furely can never make 
good Wine. But upon enquiry, they are only 
fuch forts of Grapes as grow in clofe Clufters, 
and therefore the fide next the Sun muft be 
ripe much fooner than the other 5 for the Cli- 
mate there is fo violent hot, that there arc 
no Walls ufed behind them to reflcd the Heat 
to ripen the Backs of the Bunches. 

Therefore, I fuppofe that the bed way to 
have good Wine made in thofe Parts, is to 
furnilh that Place with Vines which may bring 
their Grapes in open or loofe Bunches, fuch 

as 



Vi? ^he Country Ladfs 

as the Raifm-grape, and fome others^ which 
do not cluftcr ; for then the Sun would have 
an equal efFeft upon all the Grapes, and good 
Wine might be mad« of them : But the worr 
thy Gentleman who told me of this, has, \ 
hear, fent to St, Helena a CoUedion of fuch 
Grapes as will anfweir the defired end. 

This is likewife the Month when Saffron 
appears above ground 5 fometimes fooner, 
fometimes later, according as the Seafon is 
earlier or later. This Year, 1726, I was in 
the Saffron Country, and in the beginning of 
Auguji the Saffron-heads or Roots had fhut up 
fo long in the flowering part, that the Plan- 
ters were forced to put them into the Ground : 
i mean, fuch as were defign d for new Planta- 
tions, which is fooner by near a Month than 
they ufed to fprout, though they lay dry in 
Heaps, the Weather had fo great an effeft upon 
them. 

About Littlebury, Chefterfordy Linton, and 
fome other Places thereabouts, is certainly now 
the greatefl: Quantity of Saffron of any part of 
the Kingdom 5 the famous Place noted for- 
inerly for it, caird Saffron-Walden, being at 
this time without it. However, the People 
of the Places which I have named, do not 
forbear bringing it to Wdden Market, or dri- 
ving Bargains there for large Quantities of it, 
tho' the Market at Linton is looked upon to 
be much the beft. What I have faid in my 
Country Gentleman and Farmefs Monthly 
"Director ^ gives ample Inftructions for the Ma- 
nage- 



Director: 159 

nagcmcnt of Saffron, but I may here add a 
word or two more concerning it ; which is, 
that confidering how many Accidents the Saf- 
fron is fubjeft to, that is dry'd upon the cpm« 
mon Kilns, by the fcorching of it by too hot 
a Fire, and the Unskilfuhiefs of the Dryers, 
I do not wonder that there is fo much Saffron 
fpoiled. Where there are unskilful Hands 
employ 'd in the drying part, one ought to 
provide fuch Kilns for them as are large 
enough to diftribute the Heat moderately, and 
as conftant as poflible ; which may partly be 
helped by providing fuch a Pire as may be con- 
ftant, and not give more Heat at one time than 
another 5 for there is a great deal of Judgment 
in that. I find, that by the common way, 
fome Saffron is fcorch'd, and fome unequally 
dry'd, for which reafon I have contrived fuch 
a Kiln as muft neceffarily anfwer the end which 
is propofed in the drying of Saffron 5 that is, 
to put it into a ftate of keeping with its Vir- 
tue in it, and to put it out of the danger of 
being fcorch'd in the drying. This I fhall pub- 
lifh in my Natural Hiftory (9/Cambridgefhire 
and Effex, which will foon appear in the 
World. 

As for the way which is now commonly 
praftifed in the drying of Saffron, it is, when 
you have provided a Kiln, fuch as I have de- 
fcribed in my Farmer s Monthly 'Dire&or, 
with a Cloth made of Horfe-hair on the top, 
ftrain the Hair-cloth tight, and lay on two 
Sheets of Saffron-paper, that is, a fort of Pa- 
per 



1 6a The Country Ladfs 

per made on purpofe for that Ufe, which 
is very large 5 and prepare a little Veffel with 
fome Small-beer, and as many Chives of Saf- 
fron as will make it of a deep Colour to ftand 
by you 5 fprinkle over the Paper with a Brufh 
or Feather dipt in this Liquor, and fpread your 
Saffron upon it, either in a fquare or a round 
Figure, about three Inches thick, and cover 
the Saffron with two Sheets more of the fame 
kind of Paper, and lay a woollen Cloth upon 
them, and over that a Board, which will cover 
the top of the Kiln : view this now and then, 
till you fee that the Steam of the Saffron comes 
through the upper Papers. Then take off the 
Board and Woollen-cloth, and taking the Pa- 
pers on each fide with your Hands, turn the 
Saffron in the Papers, fo that the under-fide be 
uppcrmoft j taking off prefently after the Pa- 
pers which were firfl the undermpfj:, and then 
fmooth down the fide of the Saffron that 
was firil next the Fire with a Knife, fo that it 
lie all equal. Then cover it as it was at firfl:, 
and after a little time turn the Saffron as you 
did before, and fpread then the upper- fide even 
with a Knife, as you did at firfl ; then fprin- 
kle your Saffron with the Brufh dipt in the 
prepared Liquor upon the dry parts of the 
Cake, and cover it as before j let it lie then a 
little, and turn it as occafion requires, which 
may be fooner or later, as the Fire in the Kiln 
is quick or flow, minding every time, as you 
turn it, to fprinkle the dry parts with the 
Liquor 5 the more it fhrinks, the oftner you 

muft 



Director,' i6i 

muft turn your Cake of Saffron, minding flill 
to fprinkle the dry parts i and when it has 
fhrunk about three fourths of the firft thicknefs, 
lay a Stone or Weight upon the Board at the 
top of the Kiln, of about feven or eight Pound 
weight, the Board already being about ten or a 
dozen Pounds 5 when it is dry enough, take it 
off the Kiln, and the Paper it was dried in 
will be of good ufe s remember to keep your 
Pire gentle and clear. We may note, that a 
Gatherer of Saffron has this Year about ten 
Pence /^r Drain, and that about fix Pounds, or 
jfix Pounds and a half of raw Saffron will dry to 
a Pound 5 but generally they allow only fix 
Pounds of wet Saffron to a Pound of dry Saf- 
fron : but that depends upon the Dryers, v/ho 
fometimes out of a Wiilingnefs to get Money, 
do not dry it fo much as they ought to do. It 
is a Rule among the Saffron-Planters in Cam- 
bridgefhirej that fixteen Quarters of Saffron- 
Roots, or Heads, will plant an Acre; and 
that a full Acre this Year produces about fc- 
venteen or eighteen Pounds of dry Saffron, 
tho' the common rate is about fixteen Pounds. 
About this time you have many green Me- 
lons upon the Vines which will not ripen j and 
befides, if they would, that Fruit would now 
be too cold for the Stomach : therefore it is ad- 
vifable to pickle them, to make them imitate 
Mango's, which fomc prefer before Mango 
Cucumbers. The following is the Receipt 
to pickle them. 

To 



162 Ithe Country Ladfs 

To pickle green Melons^ in imitation of 

Mango. 

TH E Mango is a Fruit brought to us from 
the EaJl'IndieSy about the Shape and Big- 
nefs of a fmall Melon; it has a large Stone in 
it, and comes to us in a Pickle, which is ftrong 
tafted of Garlick, but approved by moft Peo- 
ple. When we gather Melons for this ufe, we 
muft wafh them and cut them, as direded 
for the Mango Cucumbers, then lay them in 
Salt and Water, fliifting the Salt and Water 
every four and twenty Hours, for nine Days 
fucccflively 5 after which, take them out and 
wipe them dry, and put into the infide of 
each, which has been already fcraped, the 
fame Ingredients direfted for your Mango 
Cucumbers, and tie them up : then boil your 
Pickle of Vinegar, Bay-Salt, and Spices, with 
thefe Mangoes in it ; fcumming it as it rifes, 
and with it a piece of Allum as directed in the 
Receipt for Mango Cucumbers, and afterwards 
follow that Receipt till your Melons are fit to 
ufe. 

Now we have Wild-Ducks fit for the Table, 
and it is to be noted, that thefe fhould not be 
larded as Land^Fowls, in the roaftingof them. 
It muft be obferved, that they be fent to Table 
with the Gravey in them 5 but before they are 
laid down to the Fire, it is pradis'd in many 
places, to chop Onions, the Leaves of red 
Sage, and mix thefe with Pepper and Salt, to 
be put in the Belly of the Ducks 5 and when 

they 



t) I R E C T O R^ 163 

they are brought to Table, pour a GJafs of 
Claret warm'd through the Body of the Ducks, 
which with fonie Gravey, that muft be fent in 
the Difli, under the Ducks, will make a pro- 
per Sauce for them. 

Another agreeable way of eating Ducks, is 
roafting them, and eating them with boiFd 
Onions $ they are fometimes ufed in Soups, and 
baked, and they like wife eat very well when 
they are half roafted, and then cut to pieces 
and ftew'd with their own Gravey and Claret, 
Now Stubble Geefe will be in feafon, after 
they have been taken up and fed for a Fort- 
night or thereabouts, in a clofe place, with Bar- 
ley and Water 5 but during their Confinement^ 
they muft never want Victuals. Note^ the Bar- 
ley muft have no more Water v^ith it than 
will juft cover it, and they muft never have 
their Corn dry. If during the time of their 
feeding, you happen to let them out to ramble 
for a few hours, they will iofe more good 
Flefh in that time, than they can regain in 
three Days ; therefore when you have once put 
them up, keep them up till they are fit to kill : 
but if you would have them very fat, put them 
in a Coop for a Week or ten Days before 
you kill them, and feed them with Barley- 
Meal and Water, made almoft as thick as 
Pafte i and always let there be feveral of them 
together, for a fingle one will pine, and Iofe 
Flelh, inftead of incrcafing it by Eating. As to 
the drcfling of this Fowl while it is young, in 
the Spring, under the Charader of a Grecn- 

i Goofe, 



1 64 The Country Ladfs 

Goofe, it is fatted m a Coop with Barley-Mea^I 
and Walcr, and being kiird and fcalded when 
'tis fat, 'tis roafted and eaten wuth green Sauce, 
or fcalded Goosberrics : but being full grown, 
as at this time of the Year, is roafted, beins firft 
faked and pepper'd within fide, and faked with- 
out fide. Some put an Onion, and fome Sage- 
Leaves into the Body of the Goofe, when it 
is laid down to the Pire, and when it is brought 
to Table, it is ferv'd with Apples itew'd and 
niafli'd in a Plate by the Side; but for the 
Sauce in the Difli, there need be none but 
fome Claret heated, and pour'd thro' the Body 
of the Goofe, to mix with its own Gravey. 
Some alfo fait Geefe, and boil them with 
Greens, as with other fait Meat ; a Goofe 
may alfo be bak'd in a Pye to be eaten cold. 
A Goofe is to be kill'd, by pulling firft the 
Feathers at the back of the Head, and cutting 
pretty deep with a fharp Penknife, between 
the back of the Head and the Neck, taking 
care that it does not ftruggle, fo as to make 
the Feathers bloody, for that will fpoil them: 
and 'tis to be noted, the Feathers of a full- 
grown Goofe are worth four Pence to be fold 
in the Country ; this I had from a Gentle- 
woman in Surrey, In Hollandxhty flk Geefe 
down the Back, and fait them with Sak-Petrc, 
and other Salt, and then dry them like Bacon 5 
they eat very well, if they are boiled tender.

OCTOBER, 




HIS Month is a noted Month fof 
brewing of Malt Liquors cfpcciallyi 
Brown, or high-dficd Malt is to be 
ufcd, as I have mentioned at jarse 



in the Month of March, under the Article of 
Brewing 5 to which I refer my Reader, to be 
fully fatistied of fuch Particulars relating to it, 
as fccm to be the Icall confider'd, altho' they 
are the moft contributing to the Perfedion of 
Malt Liquors. 

At this Scafon, Oyllcrs, Muffels, Cockles^ 
and fuch kind of Shell-Fifh are good and in 
Seafon ; as for the Oyftcr, it is not only to be 
eaten raw, but makes an agreeable Diili ilew'd, 
or in Scailop-Shelis5 and befides, being ufeful 
in many Sauces, are extremely good when they 
are well pickled. Altho' the Oyfter may feem 
foreign to a Farm, or fome part of the Coun- 
try, yet confidering that we live in a part of 
the World furroundcd with a Sea that produ- 
ces the beft Oyfters, and that they are a fort of 
Shell-Fifh which we can keep a long time, and 
feed them, I think it neceflary to take notice 
of them. About Colchefter the Oyfler-Pits 
. are only fmall Holes about twelve foot fquare,

by the fide of the River, where the fait Wa- 
tcrcomcsup, and has a paffage into them at 
the height of the Tides 5 in thefe places the 
Oyllcrs are hud, and there grow fat, and be- 
come green, by a fort of Weed which is cal- - 
led Crow-Silk : and this may be done any 
where, if there is a River with fait Water, as 
well as by CoUheJleVj and be kept two or 
three Months j fo that 1 wonder 'tis not prac- 
tifcd in other places. But if we have not this 
conveniency, yet if we lay them in Salt and 
Water after the Shells are well wafh'd, juft 
Vv/hcn they come from the Sea, they will keep 
a Fortnight in pretty good order, if the Wea* 
filer be cool, and they can have the open Air ; 
but then the Salt and Water fhould be changed 
every four and twenty hours. The following 
Pvcccipts are very good for preparing them for 
the Table. 

Tofie'w Oyjters, From Exeter. 

Akc large Oyfl:ers,open them, and fave their 
Liquor 5 then when the Liquor i'i^ fettled, 
pour off the Clear, and put it in a Stew-Pan, 
with fomc Blades of Mace, a little grated Nut- 
meg, and fome whole Pepper, to boil gently, 
tillit is ilrong enough of the Spices : then take 
out the Spices, and put in thcOyfters to ftew 
gently, that they be not hard i and when they 
arc near enough, add a piece of Butter, and as 
much grated Bread as will thicken the Liquor 
of the Oyfters 5 and juft before you take

Roafted Oyjlers in Scallop Shells. From 

Exeter. 

PRovidc fome large fcallop Shells, fuch as 
are the deepeft and holloweft you can get, 
which Shells are fold at the Fifhmongers at 
London 5 then open fuch a Number of Oy- 
fters as will near fill the Shells you dcfign, and 
fave the Liquor to fettle 5 then pour a moderate 
quantity of the Liquor into each Shell, and 
put a Blade of Mace, and fome whole Pepper 
with it ; after which, put into your Shells a 
fmall piece of Butter, and cover the whole 
with grated Bread : then fet thefe on a Grid- 
Iron over the Fire, and when they are enough, 
give the grated Bread at the tops of the Shells a 
browning with a red-hot Iron, and ferve them. 
The fame Perfon who fent the foregoing 
Receipts, concerning Oyfters, advifes another 
way of roafting Oyfters, which I think is 
a very good one, and not much known. It 
is, to take large Oyfters, open them, and hang 
them by the finny part on a fmall Spit, after 
having firft dipt them in the Yolk of an Egg, and 
roU'd them in Crumbs of Bread ; turn them 
three or four times before the Fire, and bafte 
them gently with Butter, till the Crumbs of 
Bread are crifp upon them, and ferve them hoto 
As for their ufe in Sauces, they are proper with 
Fifti, and are fometimesufed v^^ith Fowls i thci|.

lowing is an excellent Receipt. 

To pickle Oyfiers. 

I^Pen a quantity of large Oyfters, faving their 
^^ Liquor, and letting it fettle , then pour 
the Liquor clear off into a Stew-pan, and wafh 
the Oyfters in Water and Salt : after which, 
boil them gently in their own Liquor, fo that 
they are not too hard. When they are enough, 
take them out, and add to the Liquor Ibme 
Mace, a few Cloves, fome whole Pepper, a 
little Ginger, and a Bay-Leaf or two, and let 
the Liquor boil, putting to it about a fourth 
part of White- wine Vinegar, letting it conti- 
nue to boil a little more 5 then take it off, and 
let it (land to be quite cold. When the Oy- 
fters are cold, put them into Jars or Gally-pots, 
^nd pour the Liquor with the Spice cold upon 
them 5 then tie them down with Leather. 

The Muffcl and Cockle may be pickled af- 
ter the fame manner, only allowing this dif- 
ference i u e. that Cockles and Muffels are ta- 
ken out of their Shells by fetting them over

before-hand the Shells muft be wafh'd very 
clean, and then muft be put in the Sauce-pan 
without Water, they of themfelves will foon

open, take out the Fifh, and wa(h every one

the Beard, and alfo particular care miift be 
taken to examine whether there are any Crabs 
in them, for they are very poifonous, and as 
they lie in the Mouth of the Muflcl, may ea- 
sily be difcover'd j they are commonly as large 
' as a Pea, and of the fhape of a Sea- Crab, but 
are properly Sea-Spiders : the MuiTels howe- 
ver where you find them, arc not unwhole* 
fome, and it is only the eating of this little 
Animal, which has been the occafion of Peo- 
ple's fwelling after they had eaten Muflels, but 
the goodnefs of the Pifh is well enough worth 
the Care of looking after that. When your 
MufTels or Cockles are all clean pick'd and 
wafli'd, lay them to cool 5 and when their Li- 
quor is well fettled, pour off the Clear, and 
boil it up with the fame fort of Spices men- 
tioned above for the pickled Oyfters, with the 
fame proportion of Vinegar j and letting it 
fland till it is quite cold, put your Fifh into 
proper Pots, or little Barrels, and pour the 
Liquor upon them till they are covered with

ways cold before it be put upon the Fifh. 

In the Management of Cockles for pickling, 
or for eating any other way, let the Shells be

in them at their firft taking 5 but obferve to 
fhift the Salt and Water every day. The largcft

I70 The Country Ladys 

Cockles that 1 have obferv'd on the Englijh 
Coafts are thofc found about Torbay, which 
are fometimcs brought to Exeter Market j 
the Fifli is as large as a good Oyfter, and the 
Shells of fomc arc above two Inches and a half 
Diameter. Muflels and Cockles may likewife 
be ftew'd and grili'd in Scallop Shells, as direc- 
ted for Oyftcrs. The Muffels after they are 
well pick'd are flowered and fryed in fome pla- 
ces, and eaten with Butter and Muftard, and 
the French make rich Soups of them. 

As this is a Seafon when we have plenty 
of Quinces, I fhall infert the following Receipt 
for making Wine of them, which is very plea- 
fant. 

To make Sluince Wine, From Mrs. E. B, 

GAther your Quinces when they are dry, and 
wipe thcrn very clean with a coarfe Cloth, 
then grate them with a coarfe Grater or a Rafp, 
as near the Core as you can j but grate in none 
of the Core, nor the hard part about it: then 
ftrain your grated Quinces into an earthen Por, 
and to each Gallon of Liquor put two Pounds 
of fine Loaf-Sugar, and ftirittill your Sugar is 
diffolved i then cover it clofe, and let it ftand 
twenty four hours, by which time it will be 
fit enough to bottle, taking care in the bottling 
of it that none of the Settlement go into the 
Bottles. This will keep good about a Year; 
obferve that your Quinces muft be very ripe 
when you gather them for this ufe. 

Rabbits 



Director. 171 

Rabbits ftill continue in Scafon this Month, 
and befidcsthc common way of drclfing them, 
they may be larded, and dreft in the fol]ovvin*j!; 
manner > which 1 had from a Gentleman in 
Suffolk. Make a Farce for them, like that 
mentioned for the Belly of a Hare in the pre- 
ceding Month, and order its Management and 
Sauce as for a Hare. A young Rabbit, or Hare,' 
is known by the tcndernefs of the Jaw-Bones, 
which will eafily break by preffing v/ith the 
ringer and Thumb. 

Woodcocks are now in Seafon, and it is to 
be advcrtifed of them, that they are to be only 
puli'd of their Feathers, and not drawn like 
other Fowls, but the Guts left in themj when 
they are roafted, they muft be ferv'd uponToafis 
of Bread, upon which the Guts are fpread and 
eaten, when they are brought to Table. The in- 
ward of this Bird eats like Marrow 5 this isLcne- 
rally eaten withjuice of Orange, a little Salt and 
Pepper, without other Sauce. The Legs of this 
Bird are efteem'd the moft, and are therefore 
prefented to the greateft Strangers at Table 5 
but the Wings and Breaft of a Partridge are the 
principal parts of that Fowl, for the Legs arc 
full of Strings, like the Legs of Turkeys and 
Pheafants. 

The Snipe is of the fame nature with the 
Woodcock, and is ordered in every refped like 
it. Thefe may be larded with Bacon upon the 
Breaft, or elfeftrew'd with Salt and Crumbs of 
Bread, while they are roafting. Befides the 
Sauce ufcd for Woodcocks and Snipes, the a.

which is Gravey with a lirtJe minced Anchovy, 
a Rocambole, (bmc Lemon-Juice, and a little 
Whire-wine boiled together 5 and when it is 
ftrain'd, pour it in a Saucer, and ferve it with 
the Fowls. 

Thefe Birds are in plenty among the woody 
parts of England, from September till the end 
of March:, and then they all leave us at one 
time, except only fuch as have been lamed by 
the SpOitfmcn, and diiablcd for Flight j an4 
then they will breed in England^ as there are 
Inftances enough. About Ttinbridge, it is fre- 
quent to find them in Summer j and 1 have 
known the fame in Leicefierpjire. I think if 
one could take Woodcocks here in Hay-Nets, 
as they do in France^ and pinion them or difa- 
ble a Wing, and then turn them loofe again, 
we might raife a Breed of them that would 
flay with us 5 but I have experienced that they 
V7iil not feed if they arc confined in Cages or 
Aviaries, for they muft have liberty to run in 
fearch of then- Food, which they find for the 
moil part in moifl: places, near Springs 5 for I 
have often taken both the Woodcock and the 
Snipe with fuch Snares as are made for Larks, 
by laying them in the Night on the Bank of 
.Rivulets, or watery Trenches near Wood.^?

Heafants areflillin feafon, and are now 
chiefly roaft^d, for they are not fo fre- 
quently boiled, till about April, and 
then only the Hens when they are full 
of Eggs 5 biK that, I think, is too deftroying a 
way. The boiled Phcafants are generally dref^ 
fed with Oyfer-Sauce, or Egg-Sauce, but the 
roafted are either larded on the Breaft with fine 
Bacon Fat, or elfc roafted and ftrew'd with 
Crumbs of Bread : thefe, (ays xh^Siiffolk Gentle- 
man, who fent me the foregoing Method of or- 
dering the Woodcock and Snipe, fnould be 
ferved with the fame Sauces that are ufed for 
Partridges. The Sauces in his Diredions are 
within a trifle the fame as thofe I have already 
fet down in September for Partridges or Quails, 
fo that I fhall not repeat them here. 

The Truffle, which I have treated of at large 
as to its manner of Growth and Seafon of Ma^ 
turity, in my Gentleman and F armef s Month-^ 
ly T)ireCior, affords fuch Variety of agreeable 
Difhes, that 1 have taken care to fead to a 
curious Gentleman abroad for the Receipt how 
to drels it ; They are very plenty in our Woods 

in 



174 l^he Country Ladfs 

in England^ as I underftand by fcveral who 
have found them this Summer by my Dircdions, 
and 1 believe will be much more fo, fmce fe- 
veral curious Gentlemen have followed my 
Advice in propagating them. It is now, as 
well as in the two preceding Months, that wc 
may find them of a fine Flavour 5 but they 
being fomething more in perfcdion in this 
Month than in the others, I think it the pro- 
pereft to give the Methods of ordering them 
for the Tabic in this place : The firft manner 
is to broil them. 

To broil Truffles. 

THE Truffle being brought in frcfli, wafh 
it well, and cut off the rough Coat on 
theoutfide : fomc of thefc will be as large as 
one's Fift, and they are the bcft for this pur- 
pofej but let them be of any fize, as foon as 
the Coat is off, cut them through a little more 
than half-way, and put Pepper and Salt into 
the opening, and clofc it again ; then wrap 
up each Truffle in wet Paper clofe, and broil 
them over a gentle Fire of Wood-Embers till 
you judge they are enough, which will be as 
foon as they are very hot quite titrough 5 Jet 
them be turned as occafion requires, that they 
may be all equally done, and then ferve them 
to the Table in a folded Napkin. This is a 
very good way of eating them, but the other 
1 have more frequently eaten.

To flew Truffles in Wine, 

THE Truffles muft be peei'd from the 
rough Coat on the outfidc, and wcll- 
wafh'd i then cut your Truffles into Slices, 
and flew them in White-wine, or Claret, 
which you pieafe, with Salt, Pepper, and a 
Bay-leaf; or in the lieu of that, feme Ja- 
maica Pepper, and ferve them. White-wine 
for this ufe is generally preferred. 

To ftew Truffles after another manner . 

/^^ Ather Truffles, peel them and wafh them, 
^^ and then cut them in Slices ; after which 
fry them a little in a Stew-pan, with either But- 
ter or Hog's-Lard, and a little Wheat-Flower 5 
then take them out and drain them, and put 
them again in a Stew-pan with Gravey, a bunch 
of Sweet-Herbs, fome Salt, Pepper, and Nut- 
meg grated \ and when they have (Icwcd a 
little in this, ftrain the Liquor, and difh them 
for the Table, garnifhed with Slices of Lem- 
mon. Befides this way, they may be ufcd in 
the fame manner as Fowls are ftewcd or fri- 
caffeed, with brown or white Sauces, after 
they have been foften'd a little by boiling. 

While I am fpeaking of the Truffle, I may 
well enough mention the Receipts for the 
management of the Morille. Altho'the Mo- 
rilie grows \w April:, which is the only time 
when it may be gathered frefh, yet one may 
drefs the dry'd ones now, by firft foftening 
them in warm Water and Salt for three or

four Minutes 5 bur, as obferv'd before, they 
are beftfrcih gather'd. And again, I chufe to 
put the Receipts for their Management in this 
place, becaufe they are fo near a-kin to the 
Truffle. In the firfl: place, I fliali fpcak of 
drying them, which I have done in England y 
after the foliowing manner : Gather, and wafh 
them, and when they are well drained, then 
■lay them in a Difn, and dry them by degrees 
in a gentle Oven 5 and when they are through-, 
jy dry, keep them in a dry place, and in a 
cover'd earthen glazed Potj but when they are 
frcfh, order them according to the following; 
Receipts. And I am the more ready to give 
thefe to the Publick, becaufe all fuch who 
know the niceft way of eating, may not be 
difappointed in their Travels thro' Englandy 
a/d denied at the Inns fuch things as perhaps 
are as agreeable in that way, as any in the 
Country. Particularly I remember at New- 
berry, or Spinhamlandy in the publick Road to 
Batby I was at the moil publick and noted Inn 
?n that Ivoad, and had got fome very good 
Mufhrooms, and the People there were of o- 
pinion that they were poifonous, or elfe did 
iiot know how to drefs them, and by no 
means they would fend them to the Table. 
I fay, if fach miftakes can be made in a place 
where fo many People of fafhion travel con- 
tinually, it is not likely that Morilles or Truf- 
fles will be received with more favour than 
my Mullirooms 5 and I believe that fome of 
thcgveatcft Niceties of our Country may ever 

remain 



Director. 177 

remain unknown, without a Work of this 
nature, which I have pick'd up inch by inch, 
'viz, in my Travels. And befidcs, confidcr- 
ing the ftrange difagrceable Compofitions 
which one meets with in fome of our Tra- 
vels, as Sugar with a pickled Trout, and ma- 
ny more as ridiculous; I think this little Piece 
of Work not unworthy my Time. Again, 
there are many Families in England which 
have plenty about them, and do not know 
what to do with it 5 and therefore I think this 
the more neceffary. But to come to my point, 
the Morille may be drefs'd when it is either 
frcfh or blanch'd in warm Water, according to 
the following Receipts, which I had from 
France, 

I. 
To make a Ragout of Morilles. '^ 

'T^H E Morilles being frefh gathered, take off 
-^ the Roots, and wafh them, in many Wa- 
ters, for the Wrinkles in their Tops harbour a 
great deal of Dirt and Sand 5 then flit them 
lengthways, and fry them a little in a Stew- 
pan, with Butter or Hogs-Lard, letting either 
be very hot when you put in the Morilles ; 
then let them drain, and put them in afrefli 
Stew-pan with Gravey, in which fnred fome 
Parfley and Cherville very fmall, with a young 
Onion, fome Salt, and a little Nutmeg : lee 
thefe flew gently, and fend them to the Table 
garnifh'd with flices of Lemmon,or they may be 
fent to the Table in Cream, as we have already 

men- 



178 The Country Ladfs 

mentioned concerning other things in the fame 

manner. 

To fry the Mor tiles. 
Rcpare your Morillcs asdireded in the for- -^ 



mer Receipt, and boil them in a little 
Gravey gently 5 when they begin to be tender, 
rake them out of the Liquor, and flower them 
very well, then fry them in HogVLard : 
when they are thus prepared, make a Sauce for 
them of the Liquor or Gravey the Morilles 
were ftew'd in, feafon'd with Salt, Nutmeg and 
a little Juice of Lemmon. 

The following Diredions I had from aGen- 
tlcnic^n in Suffolk. The Turkey is now in 
good Seafon, and may be either boiled or 
roafted 5 when it is boiled, it is moft common- 
ly fcrved with Oyfter-Sauce, and when it is 
dcfigned for roafting, it may be larded with 
line Fat of Bacon on the Breaft, or elfe well 
ilrcw'd with Crumbs of Bread, having firft 
made a Farce to fill the Hollow of the Neck, 
where the Crop lay i this Farce may be made 
of grated Bread, Spice, Salt, buttered Eggs, and 
Ibme fweet Herbs powdered, the whole well 
mix'd and bound with the Yolk of a raw 
Ego; 5 or the Liver of a Fowl may be boiled 
and chop'd fmall and put into it. The Receipt 
as I receiv'd it direfts Beef- Suet chop'd fmall 
inftead of butter'd Eggs 5 but Mr. John Hughs, 
a noted Cook in LoruioUy tells me that Suet 
fhould be avoided in thefe Farces, bccaufc it is 

apt 



Director. 379 

apt to cool too foon, and offend the Roof of 
the Mouth, and therefore dh-eds butrer'd 
Eggs in their dead. As for the Sauce for the 
roafted Turkey, it muft be made with Gravey, 
a Bunch of fwcet Herbs, fome Lemmon-pcel, 
a Shallot or two, and feme whole Pepper and 
All- (pice boiled together and fu-ained. 

Concerning the Lark, which is now in 
Seafon, the abovemention'd Gentleman gives 
the following Directions : Let the Larks be 
pick'd only and not gutted, trufs the Legs, 
with a Leaf of red Sage to every Lark between 
the Joints of the Legs 5 then with a Feather, 
dip'd in the Yolk of an Egg beaten, wafh the 
Body of every Lark, and cover it well with 
Crumbs of Bread ; after which, cut fome thin 
Slices of fat Bacon, about three Inches long, 
and an Inch broad, and lay the Larks in a row, 
fide to fide, with a piece of this Bacon between 
every two Larks 5 then have fmall Spits about 
ten Inches long, and pafs the Spits thro* the 
Sides of the Larks and the Bacon, fo that you 
have half a dozen Larks upon each Spit, obler- 
ving to have a piece of Bacon on both the out- 
fides of the half dozen Larks ,• bade thefe well 
while they are roafting, and for the Sauce for 
them, fry fome grated Bread crifp in Butter, 
and fet them to drain before the Fire, that they 
may harden s ferve thefe under the Larks when 
you fend them to Table, and garnifh w^ith 
Slices of Lemmon. Some have their Lark-Spits 
made of Silver, and fcrve their Larks upon the 

Spits 



ISO The Country Lad/s 

Spits to the Table, by which means they keep 
hot the longer : you may eat them with Juice 
of Lemmon with the fiy'd Crumbs, but lomc 
like fuch Gravey- Sauce with them as is dired- 
ed for the roallcd Turkey. Tho' the Guts are 
left in the Larks, yet they arc not to be 
eaten. 

In my Travels I obferved a kind of Soup, 
which was very frequently ufed abroad, and 
quickly ready, that was very taking to moft 
Travellers who delighted in favoury Difhcs, 
which the People abroad call Soup a I'Tvrogne, 
It is made as follows. 

TAKE half a fcore Onions, peel them, 
and cut them in fmall Pieces into a Stew- 
pan, and fry them brown with Butter, and a 
little Pepper and Salt j and when they arc 
enough, pour fuch a quantity of Water upon 
them as you think proper to make a Soup of 
them j then let thefe boil together, and thick- 
en it with as many Eggs as are neceilary, keep- 
ing it ftirring to prevent the Eggs from Curd- 
line:. Some add to this a lar^re Glafs of White- 
wine, which I think makes it better rafted than 
'tis without it : this is ferved with a French 
Role in the middle. At the fame time I met 
with the following Receipt for Beef j^- la- 
mode, which is as good as any I have eaten.

and if you pleafe put over the Fire a little to fry 
till the outfide is brown, and then put it to

Veffel, with Salt, Pepper, Bay-Leaves or Ja-

O W is the principal Seafon for killing 
of Hogs, as well for Pork as for Bacon, 
and likewife for Brawn. I have al- 
ready in my other Works given Di- 
rections for making of pickled Pork and Ba- 
con 5 fo that I fhall fay little of it in this 
place, but give the Receipts for ordering fomc 
particular parts of Hogs. The following Re- 
ceipt I received from France, concerning the 
preparing of the Jole of a wild Boar, and have 
had it try'd in Englarkd with the Head of a 
common Hog ; and I find little difference, 
cfpecially if the Hog has been fed with Acorns. 

To drefs a Hog's Heady in imitation of the 
Jole of a wild Boar. 

TA K E a Hog's Head and burn it well all 
over upon a clear Fire, till all the Hair is 
burnt to the Skin i then take a piece of Brick, 
and rub the Head all over as hard as poffible, 
to grind off the Stumps of the Briftles, andfi- 
nifh the whole with your Knife, and then clean 
the Head very well 5 ^'hen this is done, you 

niuft

iDuft takeout all the Bones, opening the Head 
in the under Part, and beginning with the 
underJaw-Bones and the Muzzle 5 then cleave 
the Head, leaving only the Skin over the Skull 
to hold it together : take out the Tongue and 
Ithe Brains. When thus you have taken away 
all the Bones, ftab the Flelh with the Point of 
your Knife in many places on the infide, with- 
out wounding the Skin, and put Salt into e- 
very Incifion, then join the Head together, and 
tie it well together with Packthread, and thea 
wrapping it up in a Napkin, put it in a Kettle, 
with a large Quantity of Water, a large Bunch 
©f all kinds of fweet Herbs, a little Coriander 
and Anife-Seeds, two or three Bay Leaves, 
fome Cloves, and two or three Nutmegs cut 
in pieces, and fome Salt, if you think there is 
any wanting 5 add likewife two or three large 
Onions anda SprigortwoofRofemary. When 
this has boiled half enough, pour in a Bottle of 
Wine, and let it boil three or four Hours Ion- 
gcr till 'tis tender s for it will not be fo under 
feven or eight Hours boiling, if the Hog be 
large; and if it is a Boar's Head, that has been 
put up for Brawn, it will take more time to 
boil. Being boiled enough, let it cool in the 
jLiquor, and then take it out and untie it, and 
|lay it in a Difli to be carry 'd cold to the Table, 
either whole or in Slices. If you will, you may 
fait it three or fouij^days before you hmiit.

The Boars that were put up for Brawn, 
are now fit to kill. It is to be obferv'd, that 
what is ufed for Brawn, is the Flitches on- 
ly, without the Legs, and they niuft have the 
Bones taken out, and then fprinkled with 
Salt, and lay'd in a Tray, or fome other thing, 
to drain off the Blood j when this is done, 
fait it a little, and roll it up as hard as pot 
fible, fo that the length of the Collar of 
Brawn be as much as one fide of the Boar 
wiU bear, and to be, when it is rolled up, 
about nine or ten Inches diameter. When you 
have rolled up your Collar as clofe as you 
can, tye it with Linnen Tape, as tight as pof- 
fible, an-d then prepare a Cauldron with a large 
Quantity of Water to boil it : In this boil 
your Bravv^n till it is tender enough for a Straw 
topafsinto it, and then let it cool 5 and when 
it is quite cold, put it in the following Pickle. 
Put to every Gallon of Water a handful or 
two of Salt, and as much Wheat-Bran ; boil 
them well together, and then ftrain the Liquor 
as clear as you can from the Brawn, and let it 
ftand till it is quite cold, at which time put 
your Bravs^n in it 5 but this Pickle muft be re- 
newed every three Weeks. Some put half 
fmall Beer and half Water ; but then the 
fmall Beer fhould be brewed with pale Malt : 
but I think the firft Pickle is the beft. Note, 
The fame Boar's Head being well cleaned, 
may be boiled and pickled like the Brawn, and 
is asmuchcftcera'd.

This is a good Seafon to make what they 
call Hung-Beef: The way of doing it, is, to 
take the thin Pieces of the Bcefi ^nd fairing 
them with Salt-Petre about two Ounces to a 
Pound of common Salt, and rubbing it well 
into the Meat, dry it in a. Chimney with 
Wood Smoke. When this is throughly cured, 
it will be red quite through, which one may 
try by cutting 5 for if there is any of the Flefh 
green, it is not fmoked enough. It is, in my 
opinion, better than any Bacon to be boiled 
and eaten hot. 

This is what Ifhall fay, concerning the ufe 
of fuch things as are generally found about a 
Gentleman's Country- Seat, or about a Farm, 
which I think will be very ufeful, the' a lit- 
tle out of the common Road 5 and fo I fnall 
make no Apology for publiihing fuch Receipts

per Terms in fome of my Receipts in Cookery, 
I have at lead put my Receipts into Rich a Me- 
thod, as I fuppofe will make them intelligible, 
and what any one may underftand ; But 1 muft 
take notice before I conclude, that the mean- 
ing of publifhing this, is to inftrud thofe who 
may not have had opportunity of obferving 
or colleding fo much as I have done, and not 
any way pretending to inform thofe who are

INTRODUCTION. 



la&gO g^^^ma 




^^HERE is nothing induces 
me fo much, to publifh this 
Second Part of Diredlions to 
prepare the Things about a Farm orFa- 
mily, as the Encouragement my firft 
Volume, in this Way, has met with 
in the World ; which being now in 
the fixth Edition, has brought me 
many Receipts, from the Curious, 
which would be detrimental to the 
Publick if I did not offer them to the 
World. I muft acknowledge my 
Gratitude, in this Piece, to feveral 
Perfbns of Diftindlion, and good 
Oeconomy, who have favoured me 
with their Afliftance ; and, as far as 
their Leave would fuffer me, I have 

given 



vi 7he Introduction. 

given their Names or Signatures* 
Moft of the Receipts I have been 
Witnefs to, at fome Meal or other 
with them, or elfe in PubHck Places 
have purchas'd ; for I always thought 
th^t there was more fatisfa£lion in 
eating clean and well, if one had 
good Provifions in a Place, than to 
have fuch Provifions good, and 
ipoiled in their Management. 

With the many Noblemen I am 
converfant with, and in the large 
Traft of Ground I have paffed over, 
St. may not be furprizing, that I have 
colleded fo great a variety of Things 
in this way; and there is no greater 
Happinefs I enjoy, than to commu- 
nicate to the World, what I love 
mylelf : but as the Proverb fays, there 
is no difputing about l^ajies^ fo that 
every one has ftill the Liberty of 
chooling or re<aifying any thing as 

their 



The Introduction, vii 

their Palate directs, when they have 
a good Foundation to go upon. 

I think, if thefe Receipts had 
lain ftill in my Cabinet, they might 
after my death have been diftribu- 
ted to the World in a w^rong Senfe ; 
but as I have particularly been pre- 
fent amongft many of them, I have 
taken the meaning of them in Wri- 
ting; or if I had left them behind me, 
they might have been loft, which, I 
think, are much too good to be 
bury'd in Oblivion.

Country Lady's 

DIRECTOR. 

Part IL 




INCH I have publifh'd the Rc-^ 
ceipts I gathered together, with 
regard to the feveral Preparations 
of the Produds of a Farm, for 
the Table 5 entitled. The Lady's Months 
ly Tiire£ioTy &c. (now in its fixth Edition :) 
I have received a great number of Letters 
"relating to many Improvements that may 
be made to it, and am defired to publiHi 
them, in order to render my firft Volume 
more compleat. And, as I find they will be 

B of 



2 'The Country Ladys 

of public Ufe, I fhall begin with one con- 
cerning the Prefervation of Plefh, Fowls 
and Fifh from Putrefadion, or Stinking 5 
which is too often the Cafe, in Summer- 
time, when it is rare to find any fweet 
Morfels, although they have undergone 
the Difcipline of Salting. As for the com- 
mon Notion, that Women cannot lay Meat 
in Salt, equally with fuccefs, at all Times, 
it is falfe i it is the Manner of doing it, 
and not the ftate of the Women who han- 
dle it, that makes it right 5 there muft be a 
right way of Management to preferve it, 
and render it fit for the Palate, as the fol- 
lowing Letter informs us. 

To Mr. Bradley, 

S T R, 

I have not only read your Book, caird? 
The Lady's Monthly l^ireBory but 
have tafted many elegant Difhes of Meat, 
ordered by the Receipts in it 5 but I think, 
as you are a philolbphical Gentleman, you 
fhould have taken a little more Notice of 
the prefervation of Flefh from Putrefaftion : 
For in many places I have fet down to a 
Dinner which has fent me out of the Room 
by the very fmell of it 5 even, though I am 
fo much of the French Tafle, that I can 
bear the Fumette. The Husband, in this 

Cafe, 



Part II. Director, 3 

Cafe, has blamed his Wife j and the Wife 
has taken the opportunity of whifpering 
to her Husband, that the Maid was not in 
right Sorts when ihe falted the Meat : but 
I am fure, I fhall fet you to rights in that 
Point. 
I have taken pains in my Family, which con- 
fifts of thirty Perfons, to have my Wife order 
the Experiment to be made, and I amfatisfied 
from her Arguments, that there is nothing in 
the Notion above. But now to the pur- 
pofe. Let your Flefh-Meat be frefh, and 
take all the bleeding Arteries from it, then 
fprinkle it with common Salt, and let it 
lie in the Air for twelve Hours 5 but fait the 
Places, where the Arteries were, more par- 
ticularly: then wipe your Meat dry, and 
make fome Salt very hot, over the Fire, 
then rub in the Salt very well, and lay the 
Pieces of falted Meat one upon another, 
and it will keep for feveral Months. 

Or with common Salt, rub the feveral 
Pieces of Meat briskly with it, after the 
Blood is out, and efpecially in the hollow 
Places lay Salt enough. So will you be 
fure to have your Meat fweet, either Beef 
or Pork.

4 2^^ Country Ladys 

To fend Venifon Sweet in hot Weather. 

GIVE it a little Salt, and have the 
Haunches parted, taking out the 
Marrow and all the Veins, as they are 
called, that bleed ; and then wipe all of it 
quite dry after you have walh'd it with 
Vinegar, and then powder it with Pepper, 
and in an open Basket fend it up to Lon-- 
don* 

Sometimes Venifon (meaning a Buck) 
comes up to London^ not fit for the Table j 
to prevent which, order the Keeper, when 
he has killed it, to ftrew three or four 
Pounds of Pepper, beaten fine, upon it ; 
and efpecially upon the Neck Parts of the 
Sides, after he has wafh'd them with Vine- 
gar and dried them well. 

But if it ftinks, when you receive it, 
wafh it with Vinegar, and dry it, then pep- 
per it and wrap it in a dry Cloth,, bury it 
in the Ground, three foot deep at leaft, and 
in fixteen Hours it will be fweet, fit for 
eating ; then wafh off the Pepper with Vi- 
negar, and dry it with a Cloth, and hang it 
where the cool Air may pafs, and the blue 
Flies cannot come at it. §litery. Is it not 
ftrange, that we fee daily the Limbs of 
Horfes hung up in Trees, and they do not 
ftink; but remain good a long while fit for

Dogs Meat ? If any one will fay, that Dogs 
all delight to eat Carrion, I muft deny 
thatj but that every fort of Dog will roll 
himfelf in Carrion, when he can find it, is 
certain. 

To fend Partridges a long way in hot 

Weather. 

WHEN you have killed your Par- 
tridges, take out the Crop, and the 
Artery which bleeds in the Neck, then fill 
the Place with Pepper 5 and the Mouths of 
the Fowls fliould be fill'd with the fame, 
for thefe Parts take a taint fooner than the 
reft 5 the Vent too, ought to be taken care 
of, and open'd, and filled with Pepper, 
beaten grollly. i\r.5. This Pepper maybe 
always wafh'd away without leaving any 
Seafon or Flavour behind it, and is a certain 
Antidote againft Corruption. So the fame 
may be done with Pheafants, and you 
fhouid likewife leave on their Feathers. 

To keep an Hare a long Time. 

AS foon as 'tis kill'd and dlfcharged of 
its Entrails, take care that all the 
Blood be dried away with Cloths about 
the Liver, for there it is apt to fettle, then 
duft the Liver well with Pepper $ and fill 

B 3 the

6 H^e Country Ladys 

the Body with Nettles, or dry Mofs, for 
thefe will not raife a ferment as Hay and 
Straw will do, when they come to be wet i 
then fill the Mouth with Pepper, and it 
will keep a long time. 

To keep WiH-Ducks yr^/&. 

DRAW them, and fill the Body with 
red Sage, after the infide is well 
pepper^dj and likewife pepper the infide of 
the Mouth, leave on the Feathers. A Goofc 
may be ferv'd the fame way. 

But if they be too long kept, or through 
want of Care, they fhould receive a taint j 
then, when they are puird, wafli the In- 
fide very well, with Vinegar and Water, 
and dry it well with a Cloth ; and fcrape 
away, if need be, what are call'd the Kid- 
neys j then ftrew the Infide afrefh with Pep- 
per, and hang them up for an Hour or two, 
\vhere the Air may pafs through them. 

Some in fuch a cafe will put an Onion 
into the Body, which docs very well to- 
wards reftoring it to a frefhnefsj then walh 
out all, and prepare it for the Spit.

IF you would keep Fifh long, kill them 
as foon as they are out of the Water, 
and take out their Gills > then fill their

To make Wine of White Elder-berries, 
like Cyprus Wine^ from Mrs, Warbur- 
ton of Cheihire. 

TO nine Gallons of Water, put nine 
Quarts of the Juice of White Elder 
berries, which has been preffed gently from 
the Berries, with the Hand, and palled thro' 
a Sieve, without bruifuig the Kerners of 
the Berriesj add to every Gallon of Liquor 
three Founds of Lisbon Sugar, and to the 
whole Quantity put an Ounce and a half 
of Ginger, fliced, and three quarters of an 
'Ounce of Cloves 5 then boil this near an 
Hour, taking off the Scum, as it rifes, and 
pour the whole to cool, in an open Tub, 
and work it with Ale- Yeaft, fprcadupona 
Toaft of white Bread, for three Days, and 
then tun it into a Veflel that will juli hold 
it 5 adding about a Pound and a half of llai- 
fins of the Sun fplit, to lie in the Liquor 
till we draw it off, which fliould not be 
till the Wine is fine, which you will find 
about January. This Wine is fo like 
the fine rich Wine brought from Cy- 
J^rtis, in its Colour and Flavour, that it has 
deceived the befl Judges, Thefe Berries arc

ripe In Augufty and may be had at the Ivy- 
Houfe at Hoxton. 

To make Wine of Black Elder-berries, 
'which is equal to the heft Hermitage 
Claret \from Henry Marfli, Efy-y of Ham- 
merfmith. 

"^AKE nine Gallons of Spring Wa- 
ter, and half a Bufhel of Elder-ber- 
ries, picked clean from the Stalks, boil thefe 
till the Berries begin to dimple, then gent- 
ly ftrain off the Liquor, and to every Gal- 
lon of it put two Pounds of good Lisbon 
Sugar, and boil it an Hour 5 then let it ftand 
to coolj in an open Tub, for if it was to 
cool in the Copper, or Brafs Kettle, it was 
boil'd in, the Liquor would be ill-tafted. 
When it is almoft cool, Ipread fome Ale- 
Yeaft upon a Toaft of White Bread, and put 
it into the Liquor, to work three Days in the 
open Tub, ftirring the Liquor once or twice 
a Day, and then tun it in a Vcffel of a 
right fize, to hold it : At the fame time add 
to every Gallon one pound of Raifins of 
the Sun whole, and let them lie in the 
Cask till the Wine is drawn off. 

Such a fmall quantity of Wine, as is 
heredircfted, will be fit to bottle the j^^^w^- 
ary next after it is made, but larger Casks 
fliould not be drawn off till March or April

A Receipt from Barbadoes, to make Rum ; 
which proves very good, 

IN Barbadoes the Rum is made of the 
Scum and OfFal of the Sugar, of which 
they put one ninth part, or eighth part, to 
common Water, about eighteen Gallons, all 
together, in a wooden open Veffel or Tub ; 
cover this with dry Leaves of Palm, or for 
want of them, with the Leaves oiTlatanus or 
the Leaves of Fern in England^ or the Parts 
or Leaves which Flagg-Brooms are made of. 
Let this remain for nine Days, till it changes 
of a clean yellow Colour, and it will be 
then fit to diftil ; then put it into an Alem- 
bic, and you will have what we call the 
Low- Wines. A Day or two after diftil it 
again, and in the Cap of the Still, hang a 
fmall muflin Bag of fweet Tennel-Seeds, 
and the Spirit wHl be of a fine Flavour. 
Some will ufe Annifeed in the Bag, and 
fome ufe a little Musk with the fweet 
Fennel-Seeds, or elfe diftil the Spirit twice, 
viz, once with the fweet Fennel- Seeds, 
and the next with a little Musk. 

N.B, The wooden Veffels, or open Tubs, 
muft not be made of any Wood that is 
unwholefome, or fweet-fcented 5 fuch as 
Deal, Firr, or Manchineel. 

In 



lo T^e Country Ladys 

In Englandy Treacle may be ufed with 
equal Succefs, and is cheap enough to get 
a good livelihood, as appears by the feveral 
Ways mentiond above, that have been 
privately experienced. 

To make Citron- Water, from Barbadojcs. 

TAKE Citron, or Lemon Flowers, 
for the word Citron in French fig- 
nifies Lemon, though we generally in Eng-- 
land efteem the large Lemons to be Citrons, 
and the middle-fizM we call Lemons, and 
the fmalkft of that race is call'd the Lime. 
In thefe, however, there are as many varie- 
ties as we have in Apples, one is finer fla- 
vour 'd than the other. The Oranges too 
are of as many different Sorts, the Rind 
of one pleafanter than the other, and the 
Juice likewife, and fo are the Flowers va- 
rious in their Smells, fome more odorous 
than others^ yet all thefe are ufed indiife- 
rently, according to the Kinds that hap- 
pen to grow upon the feveral Eftates, where 
the Citron-Water is made, and this is the 
Pvcafon why one Sort is better than ano- 
ther, and therefore, thofe who have the 
moft pleafant Sorts, make the bed Waters 
of this Kind. 

Wc mull take, either of Citron, Lemon, 

or Orange-Flowers, four Ounces to a Gal- 

2 Jon 



Part 11. Director. ii 

Ion of clean Spirit, or Frencb-Ba^Lndy 5 put 
thefe in the Spirits, with two Pounds of 
white Sugar-Candy, beaten fine: then take 
of the beft Citron-Peels, or Lemon-Peels, 
fix Ounces, and let them fteep in the Spi- 
rits till the Liquor is ftrong enough of eve- 
ry Ingredient i and when that is done, pour 
it off, through a Sieve. And in fqme places 
they put about half a Drachm of Musk to fix 
Gallons of Liquor 5 and this has been fold 
for fixteen Shillings the Qiiart in London, 

To make fine Vinegar. 

THERE is no doubt but the making 
of Vinegar will be a confiderable 
Article, feeing that few of our fine Prepa- 
rations for the Table can be made without 
it. A Gentleman of great note has given 
me the following Receipt for it, viz. 

To nine Gallons of Water, put eighteen 
Pounds of Malaga Raifins, chopt a little. 
Stalks and all j put this into a Cask, bound 
with Iron Hoops, and place it in the warmed 
Expofure you can find in the open Air : then 
take a Florence Plask, divefted of its Straw, 
and put the Neck of it into the Bung-hole, 
fixing it as clofe as may be, with fome Lin- 
nen-Cloth, and a little Pitch and Rofin 
melted together. By this Means, if the 
Weather prove fair and warm, your Vinegar 

will 



^;> 



12 l^e Country Ladys 

will be fit for Ufe in three Weeks time. 
The ufe of the Glafs, is, that in the heat 
of the Day it will fill itfelf with the Liquor, 
and when the cool of the Evening comes 
on, that Liquor will again be returned in- 
to the Cask 5 by which means the Liquor 
will become four much fooner than it 
will otherwife do. As foon as it is clear, 
draw it off. 

To make Irifh Ufquebaugh 5 from Lord Ca- 
pell's Receipt y when he was Lord Lieu^ 
tenant of Ireland. 

TO every Gallon of jFrm^^-Brandy, 
put one Ounce of Liquorice fliced, 
oneOunce of fweet Fennel- Seeds, oneOunce 
ofAnnifeeds, one Pound of Raifins of the 
Sun fplit and ftoned, a quarter of a Pound 
of Figs fplit, two Drachms of Coriander- 
Seeds 5 let thefe infufe about eight ot nine 
Days, and pour the Liquor clear off, then 
add half an Ounce of Saffron, in a B^ag, for 
a Day or two, and when that is out, put in 
a Drachm of Musk. If when this Com- 
pofition is made, it feems to be too high 
a Cordial for the Stomach, put to it more 
Brandy, till you reduce it to the Temper 
you like. This is the fame Receipt King 
IVilliam had when he was in Ireland* 



To

To make Green Ufquebaugh. 

TO every Gallon of Fr^Wf^-Brandy 
put one Ounce of Annifeeds, and 
another of fweet Pennel-Seeds, two Drachms 
of Coriander- Seeds. Let thefe infufe nme 
Days, then take of the Spirit of Saffron one 
Drachm, diftil'd from Spirit of Wine, mix 
with the reft j infufe during this time fomc 
Liquorice fliced in Spirits, one Pound of 
Raifins of the Sun, and filter it ; put then 
a Quart of pure White- Wine to a Gallon 
of the Liquor, and when all is mix'd to- 
gether, take the Juice of Spinach boil'd, 
enough to colour it 5 but do not put the 
Spinach juice into the Liquor till it is 
cold. To this put one Pound of white Su- 
gar candied, finely powder d, to a Gallon 
of Liquor. 

To make a Cabbage-Pudding 5 from a Gen- 
tlewoman in Suffolk, as it was writ' 
ten by herfelf.

relfor^ in the Management of the feveral 
Produds of a Farm. It may as well be 
made by People of the lower as of the 
higher Rank. 

Take a Piece of boird Beef, which is 
not always done enough ; the Parts of it 
which are the leaft done, and chop them 
fmall: take as much boil'd Cabbage as you 
have Meat, and chop that as frnaU as the 
Beef, feafon this with Pepper and Salt, 
and two or three Eggs beaten, to mix it 
up in the manner of farced Meat. Whatever 
elfe of feafoning you like, put it to it j and 
when it is made into a thin Pafte, put the 
Mixture into a Linnen- Cloth, and boil it 
till it is enough, then ferve it to the Table. 
But this Pudding is much better made 
with raw fait Beef and boird Cabbage, foi- 
ls makes an extraordinary Pafte, and is much 
fofter and fuller of Gravey than the firft. 

N,B. If it is of the firft Sort, the quan- 
tity of half a Quartern Loaf of fine 
Bread, may boil an Hour, and the 
latter Sort may boil an Hour aijd a

Of the Gourmandine-Pea, and its fever al 
Ways of T>reffing. 



y.J'.'VT^OU have mention d in one of 
j[_ your Books a fort of Pea, which 
is caird the Gourmandine, or Gourmand 5 
which I fuppofe one may call, in Englifh^ 
the Glutton's Pea, bccaufe we eat all of 
it. For the Pods of it are very fweet and 
have no Film, or Skin in them, fo that 
the Cods may be as well eaten as the Peas 
themfelves $ for which reafon, when wc 
have drawn the Strings from them, as we 
do from Kidney Beans, you may broil them 
upon a Gridiron, and ferving them with 
gravey Sauce, they are very good 3 or to cut 
them Into Pieces, and fry them with Mut- 
ton Steaks 5 or elfe you may fry them with 
Beef, and they are ftill better. But the beft 
way, is to cut them crofs, as you do French- 
Beans, and ftew them in Gravey with a lit- 
tle Pepper and Salt, there is not any thing 
in my Opinion can eat better 5 and to be 
put in a gravey Soop, are incomparable j 
efpecially, if they have been parboil'd, and 
rubb'd dry, and then fry'd in burnt Butter. 

The fmalleft dwarf 'crooked Sugar-Pea, 
that you recomuiend, is of the fame qua- 
lity, but rather better, for all thefe Ufes,

To make Verjuice of Grapes^ unripe^ or 
of Crab-Apples $ from J. S. Efc[^ 

TAKE Grapes full grown, juft be- 
fore they begin to ripen, and bruifc 
them, without the trouble of picking them 
from the Bunches 5 then put them in a Bag, 
made of Horfe-Hair, and prefs them till 
the Juice is difchargedj put this Liquor in- 
to a Stone Jar, leaving it uncovered for 
fome Days, then clofe it and keep it for 
ufe. This Verjuice is much richer than that 
of the Crab- Apple, and has a much greater 
influence in the. way of Callico-Printing; 
but is harder to come at, few People being 
willing to gather their Grapes unripe 5 but 
where there is a- large Quantity, it is well 
worth while. N,B. It will do well, if 
the Liquor is put into common Casks, 
but is nicer to the Palate if it is kept in 
glazed Jars of about eight or nine Gallons, 
and the Berries might then be pick'd from 
the Stalks. Keep this in a good Vault, 
and it will remain good for three or four 
Years as Verjuice 5 but a little more time 
will make it lofe its Sournefs, and it will 

become like Wine.

The Verjuice of Crab-Apples fhould be 
made of the wild Crab, which produces 
Thorns on its Branches, and brings a fmall 
round Apple, fuch as are common to be

cular in this, becaufe fome Apples, which 
are cali'd Wildings, are fuppofed to have

if in any Bunch there is a rotted Grape, 
cut it off, and fee that your Bunches are 
quite clean in their Berries 5 and befides,

great Scales from it : then take off the 
Head, the Fins and Tail; and if there is 
any Spawn in it, fave it to be cured for 
Caviar. When this is done, cut your Fifh 
into fmall Pieces, of about four Pounds 
each, and take out the Bones, as clean as 
poflible, and lay them in Salt and Water 
for twenty-four Hours 5 then dry them well

The Manner of "Sickling and drying of 
Sheeps Tonguesy or Hogs Tongues^ which 
they call Stags Tongues^, from a cele- 
brated "Fradiitioner of forty Tears Jiand-- 
ing in London. 

THE Sheeps Tongues, which arc 
commonly bought in the London 
Markets, are the beft, if they are the Tongues 
of Wethers, fed in low Lands j being the 
largeft, as they are taken from the largeft 
fort of Sheep : but the Tongues of all Sorts 
of Sheep are good enough to be worth 
Pickling. But there is this Difference in 
the Value, that one large Tongue, well 
cured, will fell for three Pence, while the 

fmalleft 



2S The Country Ladys 

fmalleft Sort, cured in the fame manner, will 
only fell for Three Half-pence, or a Pen- 
ny. Thefe Tongues are bought in Quan- 
tities of the Carcafs Butchers, about White- 
chappely and other Butchers about Town, 
who kill from One hundred to Six hun- 
dred Sheep in a Day, each Butcher ; and 
they know very w^ell how to cut out the 
Tongues, with all their Parts to advan- 
tage : but they are afterwards trimm'd, when 
we receive them, into a more regular 
Shape, by thofe who cure them. When wc 
are about this Work, there is one thing ne- 
ceffary to be obferv'd, efpecially in hot 
Weather, but always it is beft to be done \ 
which is, cut the fleiliy Part of the Bottom 
of the Tongue length-ways, and you will 
find, towards the Root, an Artery, which 
asfoon as 'tis cut will bleed, and joining to 
that is a kind of Sweet-bread 5 take thefe 
out, as clean as you can, without disfiguring 
the Tongue 5 othervvdfe the Tongues willhave 
an ungrateful Smell, and putrify : fo, that 
if you deal by Wholefale, they will be re- 
turned upon your hands, or be a trouble 
to the Pamily where they are made. Wafh 
thefe well, after trimming, in Salt and Wa- 
ter, and then fait them with common Salt, 
well dry'J, in an Iron Kettle ; one pound 
to half an Ounce of Salt-Petre, or Nitre, 
powdcr'd and well mix'd. Rub them well 

z with 



y 



Part II. Director. 29 

with the Mixture, and lay them clofe together 
in a Tub, or glaz'd earthen Veffel ; and, after 
a few Days, when they are fait enough, take 
them from the Pickle, and when they are 
a little dry, tie them by the Tips, half 
a dozen together 5 and hang them up in a 
Chimney, where Deal Saw-Duil: is bumt> 
till they are fmokcd enough, to be cured 
for boiling 5 then boil them in their Bunches, 
and let them dry for Sale. But to come a 
quicker Way to cure thefe Tongues, in the 
Pickle, as we do generally, is to make a Brine 
or Pickle in the following manner 5 that is, 
take a quantity of Water, and make a 
Pickle of it with common Salt, boil'd till 
it will bear an Egg j and then put in to 
every Pound of Salt, half an Ounce of Ni- 
tre, or Salt-Petre 5 and when the Pickle is 
cold, throw in your Tongues : which is the 
quickeft Way. But for drying of them, the 
Smoking-Clofets will do perfectly well, 
only we have not always thofe Conveni- 
encies. 

The Smoking-Clofets. 

IT Is to be obferv'd, from your own 
Writings, That the Smoking-Clofets 
are of great ufe in curing of Hams 5 and 
they are no lefs Lifeful in drying of Tongues, 
I have, in a place, in the Country, one of 

them 



30 ^e Country Ladys 

them in a Garret, where We enclofc a Room 
of ten foot Square, where is a Chimney, 
into which, by a Regifter, we let in tlie 
Smoke from the Fire, which is made on 
a Hearth, on the ground Floor 5 fo that 
the Smoke then does not come too hot on 
the Tongues, and fo preferves them from 
turning rufty. This is much the beft way of 
curing them, and one may cure, in fuch a 
Room, fourfcore dozen at a time. This Place, 
likewife, wecureourHung-Beef in. Wchave 
try'd fome Sheeps Tongues, falted only in 
a Brine of common Salt, and dry'd in fuch 
a Room; and they are very red, and well 
tafted, though there is no Salt-Petre ufed 
in the Pickle.

Xhe Manner of making the famous Barce- 
lona SnufF, as it was performed at the

is alfo caltd Myrtle SnufF. 

TAKE Seville Snuff, and prepare a 
dry Barrel, that has not had any Wine 
in it, or of any Scent ; then cut the frefh 
Tops of Myrtle, and lay a layer of them at 
the bottom of the Cask, an Inch or two 
thick ; then lay SnufF on that as thick, and 
lay on more Myrtle, two Inches i then a- 
gain, put on SnufF, and fo fill the Barrel in 
the fame Manner, Stratum fuper Stratum. 
Then prefs it down with a Board, that will 
fit, and fet three Weights upon it of a quar- 
ter of an Hundred a-piece, and let it ftand 
four and twenty Hours ; then turn it out, 
and fift it, flinging the Myrtle away ; then 
put it into the Cask, as before, with frefh 
Myrtle, and ferve it fo three times, and fift 
it off. When this is done, add to every ten 
Pounds of SnufF, one pound of Orangery 
SnufF, and mix the whole very well, and 
after three days, put it into glaz'd Pots, well 
prefTed into them, and ftopt clofe ; or elfe

beft. 

To make Orangery Snuff. From the fame. 

TAKE Seville SnufF and Orange-Flow- 
ers, frcfh gathered early in the Morn- 
ing. And in a glaz'd Earthen Veffelj lay 
a Layer of the Flowers, then a Layer of

SnufF, in the fame manner as before i and 
at the end of four and twenty Hours fift it 
off again, and repeat the fame the third time : 
being fure that the Flowers do not remain 
longer than twenty-four Hours, z\iz they 
will four the SirufF. In making this Snuff, 
you ought to allow at leafl apound for Wafte, 
for the Flowers will gather a great deal of 
it.

caird Hogs-Seame) wafh this well in 
Spring- Water, beating it all the while with 
a piece of Wood j then take Orange-Flow- 
ers, frefh gather'd, and melt the Lard gent- 
ly, and put about a quarter of a pound of the 
Blowers into a pound of Lard; let them

36 T*he Country Ladys 

remain ten Minutes, gently keeping them 
warm over the Fire 3 then ftrain it off, and 
when the Lard is again cold, beat it, and 
wafh it with Orange-Flower-Water. Then 
melt it gently a fecond time, and put in 
frefh Flowers, in the fame manner as before, 
and it will become of a yellow Colour , 
and, when it is cool, beat it again with a 
wooden Paddle and Orange-Flower- Water, 
and then put it into Pots for ufe. I fliould 
remark, that the Lard fhould be melted by 
putting it in a glazed Veffel, and melting it 
by putting the Veflel into boiling Water. 

To make Flour of Muftard. 

THOSE who live in the Country, or 
go to Sea, have frequent occafion 
to ufe Muftard, when there is no opportu- 
nity of getting it without extraordinary 
Trouble. It is a Sauce feldom thought on 
till the Minute we want it 5 and then, accord- 
ing to the old Way of making it, if we are 
lucky enough to have Muftard- Seed in the 
Houfe, we muft fpend an Hour in the Cere- 
mony of grinding it in a wooden Bowl, and 
an Iron Cannon-Bullet, according to the old 
Cuftom i or, if we have Muftard by us, rea- 
dy made, if it has flood a Week, it is then 
of no value, if it is in fmall quantity. But 
to obviate this Difficulty, the Invention of 
grinding Muftard-Seed in a Mill, and there- 
by 



Part 11. Director. 37 

by reducing of it to Flour, to be made fit 
for the Table in an inftant, has been very 
well received : for by that Contrivance we 
have it always frefh, and full of brisk Spi- 
rits, and may only make juft what we want 
without any fpoil, as long as we keep a 
Stock of this Flour by us. 

There are two Sorts of Muftard : viz^ 
The white Sort, which is a large Grain, and 
not fo ftrong^ and the black Sort, which 
is a fmall Grain. That which I account the 
beft, is from the wild Muftard, commonly 
found growing in Effex, which fells the beft 
ia the Markets. But from whatever Place 
we have it, regard fliould be chiefly had to 
its being free from Muftinefs, which hap-

To make Sugar Comfits of any Sort. From 
Mrs. Anne Shepherd of Norwich. 

THE Seeds which we generally make 
Comfitts of, arc Carraways, Cori- 
ander and Anife-Seeds •, thefe, when they are 
cover'd with Sugar, are caird Comfits, 
iConfe£is), 

The Inftruments to be employed for this 
Ufe, are firft a deep-bottom'd Bafon of Bell- 
Metal, or Brafs, well tinned, to be hung 
over fome hot Coals. 

Secondly, You muft have a broad Pan 
to put hot Coals in. 

Thirdly, Provide a Bra(s Ladle to pour 
the Sugar upon the Seeds. 

Fourthly, You muft have a Brafs Slice to 
fcrape off the Sugar that may chance to hang 
upon the fide of the hanging Bafon. 

Then take care that your Seeds are dry, 
or dry them well in your hanging Pan. 

To every quarter of a Pound of Seeds 
ufe two Pounds of fine Sugar beaten; unlefs 
to Anife-Seeds, ufe two Pounds of Sugar 
to half a Pound of Seeds. 

To begin the Work, put three Pounds of 
fine Sugar into the Bafon with one Pint of 
Water, to be ftirr'd well together till the 
Sugar is wet 5 and boil it gently, till the Su- 
gar will rope from the Ladle like Turpcn* 
tine, and it is enough. Keep this however 

warm. 



4-6 jt^e Country Ladys 

warm, upon warm Embers, that it may run 
freely in a ropy Way from the Ladle upon 
the Seeds. 

When this is ready, move the Seeds brisk- 
ly in the Bafon, and fling on them half a 
ladle-full at a time of the hot Sugar, keeping 
the Seeds moving for fome time 5 which will 
make them take the Sugar the better, and be 
fure to dry them well after every covering, 
by moving the Bafon, and ftirring the Com- 
fits. In an Hour, you may make three Pounds 
of Comfits : you will know when they are 
coated enough with Sugar, by their becom- 
ing as large as you would have them. There 
is no certain Rule, but our own Fancies, for 
the Size of them. Note, Till they are as 
you would have them, caft on more melted 
Sugar, as at firft, and keep them ftirring and 
fhaking in the Pan, drying them well after 
every Coat of Sugar. 

If you would have ragged or rough Com- 
fits, make your Sugar fo liquid, that it will 
run from the Ladle y and let it fall upon the 
Seeds about a Foot and a half high. Let it 
be very hot, for the hotter it is, the rougher 
Will be your Comfits 5 and for all that, the 
Comfits will not take fo much Sugar as one 
may imagine from their Appearance. Put 
on at each time only one Ladle- full, and in 
ten times repeating it your Comfits will 
be perfeftly well coated. 

For 



Part 11. DiREefOR* 45^ 

lor plain Comfits; let not your melted 
Sugar be too hot at firft, nor too thick 5 nei- 
ther pour it on the Seeds too high : but the 
lafl: two or three Coverings may be thicker 
and hotter. 

As for Coriander^Seeds, which are large, 
three Pounds of Sugar will only cover a 
quarter of a Pound of them. 

While your are at work, you fhould keep 
your melted Sugar in good Temper, that it 
may not gather into Lumps, or burn to the 
bottom of the Pan 5 and to prevent its grow^ 
ing too thick at any time, put to it a fpooa- 
ful or two of Water, gently ftirring it now 
and then with your Ladle, keeping your 
Fire very clear under your Pan. When youn 
Comfits are made, put them upon Papers ia 
Difhes, and fet them before the Fire, or in 
a declining Oven, which will make them 
look of a Snow white 5 when they are coq1;» 
put them in Boxes, or in cryftal Bottles.

Hard Peafe-Soup. From the fame. 

THERE are many ways of making 
Peafe-Soup. In great Families it is 
fometimes made of Beef, but a Leg of Pork 
is much preferable 5 and in fmallcr Families 
the Bones of Pork, as they are called. And 
the Shin and Hock of a Leg of Pork, after 
they have made SaufageSj may be had at 
the Saufage-Houfes : thcfe boil'd for a long

time, will afford a ftrong Jelly Broth, but 
they are hard to be met with. However, 
when they are to be had, you have the Di- 
reftions for a Broth. Then pafs the Broth, 
hot, through a Sieve, and put into it half 
a Pint of Hit Peafe to a Qiiart of Liquor ; 
or a Qiiart of whole Peafe to three Quarts 
of Liquor. The Difference between one 
and the other, is, the flit Peafe will open 
in the Liquor, when we boil it, and the 
other ought to be broken through a Cullen- 
der, when they are boifd : but the flit Peafe" 
are the beft j and when you put them inta 
the Liquor to boil, add to every Quart of 
Liquor as much Sallery as you think pro- 
per, cut fmall 5 fome powder of dry'd Mint, 
fome powder of dry'd fweet Marjoram, 
fome Pepper^ and fome Salt, to your mind^^^ 
and let thefe boil till the Sallery is tender. 
This is to be done, if we boil a Leg of Pork, 
after the Pork is out of the Pot j but if we 
make the Soup from the Bones, boil thefe 
Ingredients afterwards ifl the Liquor. When 
you, ferve it, put a French Pvoie in the mid- 
dle of the Dilh, and garnifli the Border of 
the Difli with rafp d Bread fifted. Some 
put in AU-fpice powdefd, which is very 
agreeable : and one might add the Leaves of

To make an artificial Crab or Lobfter. 
From Mr.i. ^Buckingham. 

ISuppofe you have by you the large Shells

Gundy, as they call it m England , but is 
very much like the Thing we want : and I 
think, if the Shrimps, or others, were put

ther the Bonum Magnum-, as it is calFd, 
which is a large, long, red Plum, with a 
Pulp very tender, but four, when it is raw 
from the Tree. Another is a large Plum, 
rather yellowifh than white, when it is ripe, 
and of the former Shape, like an Egg, which 
is called by fome the Egg-Plum ; but more 
particularly the white Holland^lnm^ and is 
{o called bv the Gardeners. Thefc two have a 
Flefh and Juice much like one another, and 
make afineShew in aDifli;, by way of Defcrt 5 
but are in my Opinion only fit for flev/ing. 
However, the Skins will part eafily from 'em, 
when they arc ripe, and they both quit the 
Stone freely. Take thefc and peel them, and 
divide them ; then put them in a little Water 
and their weight of fine Sugar, made into a

then lard the Liver, if you will, with Bacon 
Fat, and roaft it, flouring it very well, and 
bafthig it with Butter, till it is enough. But 
it is reckoned rather better by fome, when

YO U have often told me, that you was 
a Lover of Cucumbers, and more efpe- 
cially ftew'd, than any other way 5 which I 
j5nd many others of my Friends come into. 
I propofe, that you fliould pare and flice Cu- 
cumbers as ufual for ftewing; and then with 
a little Salt and Pepper, with their own 
Liquor ftew them in a Sauce-Pan till they 
are a little tender 5 then pour them into

from the Liquor, boil fome White Wine, 
with Water, half one, and half the other, 
with whole Pepper i and when the Liquor 
is cold, put the Cucumbers into a Gally- 
pot, and pour the Liquor over them : and, 
if you put a little Oil upon the Liquor, I 
am perfuaded they will keep feveral Months.

'Tn'HOyGH the Mary gold Flower is 
^1^ of old date in Pottage i yet it con- 
tinues ftill its ftand among the uleful things 
of the Kitchen, and cannot more eafily be 
worn out, according to the cuftom of the

Broth. Mint with Peafe, Fennel with Mac- 
karel, and fuch like, cannot be forgot. And 
as the Mary gold-Flowers are ufed in Porridge,

a Pound of fmooth Caraway Comfits j then 
put fome Butter on the Sides and Bottom 
of your Pan, and put in your Cake, and 
one Hour and a quarter will bake it. When

Water, and two or three bits of Lemon-PeeJ, 
and fet this in a Sand-heat, for fix or eight 
Hours, or let them infufe about ten Hours 
upon hot Embers. Then boil it briskly, and 
when you find it will jelly, as you may do, 
by taking out a little of the Liquor in a 
Spoon, and cooling its then fl:rainit off, 
and add to it about half a Pound of double- 
refined Sugar powder'd very fine ; about a 
Gill of Sack, or two or three fpoonfuls of 
Mountain Wine, the Juice oftwo Lemons 5 
then fet this on a flow Fire, and as it heats, 
beat the Whites of two Eggs to a froth, 
and put it into the Pan, where the Jelly is, 
at times as it rifesj and then, when it juft 
boils up, take it from the Fire, and it will 

be 



94 7^^ Country Ladys 

be clarified. Then pour it by fmall quan- 
tities into the Jelly-bag, and let it drop or 
run into fome Receiver , but it will be apt 
to run thick at iirft : then take that which 
is firft run, if it be thick, and pour again in- 
to the Jelly- bag, and you will tind it come 
clear. Then place your Glafles to receive it, 
and change the full one for another, which 
you muft carefully watch, that your Glafles 
be not foil'd in the leaft, for the Beauty of 
this, in one particular, is its tranfparcncy ; 
and again, it fhould not be too ftiff. Some 
only take the Harts-horn Shavings, fix Ounces 
to two Quarts of Water, and boil it gently 
till the Liquor will jelly, without the ex- 
pence of a Sand-heat, or fetting it on hot 
Embers, The boiling it is the befl: way, 
but requires more Patience.

gently in the Sun, or before the Fire, and 
ftrip them from the Stalks i when the leafy 
part will crumble, between the Fingers; 
then put it into a Mill, and with a Peftle 
rolling about it, the Tobacco will prefently 
be ground, as fine as SnufFj orelfe, if you 
have never a Mill, when your Tobacco will 
break between the Fingers, lay it on an 
oaken Table, and pafs the flat fide of a 
Knife over it, backwards and forwards, as 
if you was whetting it, pre (ling it hard, and 
you will make fine Snuff. This I mention 
here, becaufe, fometimes, the Snuff-takers 
are without Snuff, and remote from any 
Place where it m^y be had, and would give 
any Money for it 5 which was my Cafe,

Butter turned to Oil recovered. From 
Mrs. M. N. 

THERE are fome Lands, as well as 
fome Treatments of Butter in the 
Dairy, that ma'kes the Butter fo very fat 
and greafy, that it is hard to melt, without 
running to Oil, while, oh the other hand, 
there is a fort of Butter, which cuts as firm 
as Wax 5 and even this will fometimes turn 
to Oil in the melting, but very feldom. 
However, when it fo happens, pour your 
oil'd Butter into a Porringer, and letting it 
ftand a little, melt a little frefh, and as foon 
as it is liquid, pour into it, by gentle de- 
grees, at times, fome of the Butter that was 
oird before, keeping your Sauce-pan fhaking 
all the whiles and if you find it any way 
difficult to be recovered, pour in a little 
Milk, and fhake them together, and it will 
recover. Memorandum^ A Sauce- pan that 
is very thin at the Bottom is apt to oil But- 
ter^ let it be ever fo good. 

Orange or Lemon-Cakes. From the fame. 

TAKE fome preferv'd Orange or Le- 
mon-Peels, wafh'd from their Syrup 5 
then beat them, in a Marble Mortar, to a 
Pulp, adding a little Orange- Flower-Water 
to them, and a very little Gum-Arabic to it

To dry Plums, of any forty without Sugar. 
From the fame. 

TAKE a Wyre Sieve, and gather your 
Plums, not too ripe, nor in the heat 
of the Day; run a Needle through the Skin 
of each of them, and lay them on the Sieve, 
fo as not to touch one another. Put your 
Sieve then into a declining Oven, and let 
it ftand twelve Hours; then let it by, and re- 
peat the fame the fecond and third time, 
and if the Plums are large, then it may be 
they will require the fourth or fifth time ; 
but turn them every time, when you are 
going to put them in the Oven. They 
will dry by this Means fo well, that you 
may keep them all the Winter, for ufe, in 
Boxes, in a dry Place. Memorandum, Some 
of them will candy on the Outfides. The 
Mpflel-Plum is a very good one for this

to have the particular Difh that is the Fa- 
vourite of every County. In IVorceJierfhire 
and Shropjhirey the following is in efteem, 
and I believe you will oblige feveral Gen- 
tlemen and Ladies of thefe Parts, if you 
would infert it in fome of your Works. 

Take fome good middling Bacon, and 
fry it 5 then put in fome Calfs Liver, and 
cut it in thick Pieces, pepper it, and fait 
it J and when it is enough, for it muft not 
be fry'd hard, have ready prepared fome 
Cabbage-Lettuce, fome white Beet-Cards, 
or Beet-Leaves, and fome Spinach-Leaves, 
and chop them together, with fome Parfley, 
but not too fmall 5 then chop fome Onion, 
and mix with the reft 5 then throw them 
into your Frying pan, with a piece of Butter, 
when the Bacon and Liver is out, and fry 
them till they are tender, and as brown as 
may be$ putting in a fpoonful of Verjuice, 
or the Juice of a Lemon, a little before 
they are enough. And having kept the Li- 
ver and Bacon hot all the while, pour thefe 
Herbs over them, which ought to be in good 
quantity. 

Fine Cakes to keep. From the fame, 

TAKE a Pound of fine Sugar pow- 
dered, and fome what lefs than a 
Quart of Flour. Rub thefe with a Pound 
of frefh Butter, and mix it with three or

four Yolks of Eggs, with fome Orange- 
Flower- Water, and a little Ale-Yeaft : fet 
this Pafte before the Fke to rife, and roll 
put your Cakes thin, while the Pafte is hot 5 
then cut them into what Shapes you pleafe, 
and prick them on the top, and bake them 
in a gentle Oven. They will keep a long 
time and are very good. 

To make Penzance?fCakes, From the fame. 

'TT^ AKE the Yolks of Eggs well beaten, 
\ put to them iome Mace finely pow- 
dered, with a few fpoonfuls of Wine, a

then add as much Flour as is neceffary, and 
a fmall quantity of Ale-Yeaft, and work 
your Dough pretty ftifF; then add fome 
frefh Butter, broken in little bits, and work 
it in till ail the Pafte has partaken of it, 
and the Dough becomes as ftift as at firft. 
Make your Cakes then, and bake them. 
They will keep fome time. 

To make Cryjial candy d Sweet-meats. 
From the fame. 

WHEN we propofe to make thefe can- 
dy'd Sweetmeats, w^e muft firft: 
know what Fruits, Flowers, &c. are piro- 
per for them, and how thofe ought to be 
gathered and prepared. 

Firft 



Part 11. Director. 121 

Firft of all, to begin with the Flowers. 
I Take Orange-Flowers, or Lemon, or Ci- 
tron-Flowers5 gather them, when the Dew 
is upon them, in the Morning, becaufe the 
Leaves of them will be then full, and then 
they are beft to ufe, when the Leaves are 
pickM off, and then the Dew will be gone ; 
but if they lie a Day, they will (brink, turn 
bitter, and of a yellowilh brown Colour. 
Take thefe Leaves frefh picked, and pour the 
following Compofition upon them. 

You may take alfo fome Orange, or Le- 
mon, or Citron, preferred, and dry'd, and 
cut them in fmall pieces. Or Apricots dry'd 
and cut into fmall pieces, or fuch forts as are 
a little hard in themfelves will do. If one 
was to cut fome Pine-Apple, or Ananas, 
fimply or preferv'd, and cut that in pieces, 
it would beentomb'd in a Rock of Sui^ar; 
or Currans preferv'd upon their Stalks may 
do, if you think it worth while 5 but O- 
range-Flower-Leaves do very well. It is 
a fine Candy to carry in the Pocket. 

Then to begin your Bufinefs. Take one 
Pound of double-refined Loaf-Su^ar beat 
fmall, and finely lifted 5 mix this with four 
or five fpoonfuls of Orange-Flower- Water, 
and about half a Drachm of Gum-Arabic 
finely beaten $ then put three fpoonfuls of 
White Wine, and mix all together, and boil 
them in a glazed earthen Veffel till theLiquor 
will hardly run, or at leaft run in Ropes 5 then 

have 



122 Hoe Country Ladys 

have fmall Jars of earthen Ware glazed, and 
put into each of them the feverai forts of 
Fruits, and Flowers, you would inclofe in 
candy 'd Sugar, making thofe Jars very hot, 
and immediately pour theLiquor upon them, 
and flop themclofe, then put the Jars into 
a Stove, for a fortnight or more, and you 
may then break the Jars, and your feverai 
Fruits and Flowers will be inclofed in a cry- 
ftal like Candy, fuch as white Sugar- Can- 
dy. And then with a flight blow of an Ham- 
mer, break thefe Candies into Pieces of a- 
bout a Finger's length, and keep them in 
Glaffes flopt clofe, in a dry Place, and 
they will remain good feverai Years. The 
little Pots mufi be broken of courfe. 

T^o make a Hackin. From a Gentleman in 
Cumberland. 
Sir, 

THERE are fome Counties in Eng- 
land^ whofe Cufloms are never to 
befet afidcj and our Yii^ndi^vaCumberlandy 
as well as fome of our Neighbours in Lan- 
cajhirey and elfe-where, keep them up. It 
is a Cuflom with us every Chriflmas-X^z^ 
in the Morning, to have, what we call an 
Hackin, for the Breakfafl of the young Men 
who work about our Houfe 5 and if this Difli 
is not dreffed by that time it is Day-light, 
the Maid is led through the Town, between 
two Men, as fafl as they can run with her,

Part IL Director. 123 

up Hill and down Hill, which fhe accounts 
If a great fhame. But as for the Receipt to 
make this Hackin, which is admired fo much 
by us, it is as follows. 

Take the Bag or Paunch of a Calf, and 
wafh it, and clean it well with Water and 
Salt i then take fome Beef-Suet, and fhred 
it fmall, and fhred fome Apples, after they 
are pared and cored, very fmall. Then put 
in fome Sugar, and fome Spice beaten fmall, 
a little Lemon-Peel cut very fine, and a 
little Salt, and a good quantity of Grots, 
or whole Oat-meal, fteep'd a Night in Milk 5 
then mix thefe all together, and add as ma- 
ny Currans pick'd clean from the Stalks, 
and rubb'd in a coarfe Cloth 5 but let them 
not be wafh'd. And when you have all rea- 
dy, mix them together, and put them into 
the Calf VBag, and tye them up, and boil 
them till they are enough. You may, if you 
will, mix up with the whole, fome Eggs 
beaten, which will help to bind it. This 
is our Cuftom to have ready, at the open- 
ing of the Doors, on Chrifimas-V>7Cj in 
the Morning. It is efteem'd here; but all 
that I can fay to you of it, is, that it eats 
fomewhat like a Chrijimas-Vy^, or is fome- 
what like that boil'd. 1 had forgot to fay, 
that with the reft of the Ingredients, there 
Ihould be fome Lean of tender Beef minced 
fmall. 

The 



124 ^^ Country Lady s 

The Northampton-Cake. 

TAKE a Peck of Flour, and a Pound 
of fine Sugar beaten well into Pow- 
der, and fifted; then add a quarter of an 
Ounce of Cloves, half an Ounce of Cin- 
namon, and a large Nutmeg, and beat them 
to powdery put to this fome Orange-Flow- 
er-Water, or Rofe- Water; then take five 
or fix Pounds of Currans well pick'd, and 
rub'd dry with a coarfe Cloth, but not 
wafh'd. Put thefe with your Fruit, and a 
little Salt into the Flour j then take as much 
Cream as you think proper : then melt two 
Pounds of Butter, to mix with it, and add 
a Pint of Canary- Wine, and kneed it with 
fome frefh Ale-Yeaft, till it rifes under your 
Jiand. Have your Oven hot before you put 
it in the Hoop for Baking. 

Of the Baking of Fruit. From Mr, L. M. 

IT is to be obferved, that all Fruits that 
are ripe require little baking, and thofe 
which are of the hardeft, or mod unripe 
Sorts, ought to have a long and gentle 
baking. In Pears, for example, when we 
have fome of thofe, which ripen in the Au- 
tumn, they will bake with a Tart ; for as 
they are ripe of themfelves, they requite 
very little baking, for Ripenefs is one de- 
gree tending to Rottennefs 5 and as that is 

done 



Part 11. Director, 125 

done by heat gently, fo the Oven brings 
that to a certain height, fuddenly, with its 
fafeguard of Sugar 5 that the Fruit comes 
to its full flavour, with the additional beau- 
ty, from the Sugar. It would have done 
a great deal by Nature itfelf, if the Tree had 
fiood in a place agreeable; but much more 
would it be for thofe baking Pears, as we 
call them, if they had the advantage of a 
good Climate 5 one may guefs then how 
much difference there is between one and 
the other. In the tough and hard Pears, 
one ought to bake them twice, that is, once 
with a little Water and Sugar, in as hot an 
Oven as they bake Bread in 5 and then put 
them in Pyes, and bake them over again, 
fo will they become tender, well tafted, and 
of a fine colour. But be it as it will, as 
foon as either of thefe come out of the O- 
ven, pour Ibme Cream over them, and mix 
it with them, if chey are to be ferved hot, 
mafhing the Fruit all the while j but if they 
are to be lerved cold, then only pour fome 
Cream over them, when they jufi come from 
the Oven, and let it remain till you ferve 
it cold. 

There is one way which is praftifed by 
fome, and that is, to break the hard Pears, 
juft when they are taken out of the Oven, 
in the Pye 5 for elfe the outfides, though 
the Rind is off, will be hard, and tough : 

then 



126 The Country hadys 

then pour on the Cream. It is to be noted, 
that all ripe Apples require Icfs baking, and 
lefs Sugar, than the hard Apples, which do 
not become ripe till fome Months after- 
wards. When an Apple, or Pear, for ex- 
ample, is as ripe as it can be in our Climate, 
it will have fome foftnefs, and fome fweet- 
nefs in it, and therefore will require lefs 
baking, as baking is only a fort of ripening ; 
and fo on the other hand : but we are provi- 
dentially provided with both Apples and 
Pears, which are, fome ripe fooner, and fome 
ripe later 5 even that by the end of 3^^/^ we 
have fome ripe, and fome remain hard and 
four till June. We ought be apprifed of the 
Sorts, to take them in their feveral Seafons, 
and not to take the Winter Fruits, for bak- 
ing, when we have ripe Fruits by us. Ma- 
ny thoufand Bufhels of Fruit are loft for 
want of this Caution. 

So at any time, when you ufe Apples, or 
Pears, for Tarts, Puddings, or Sauces, let 
them be all of one Sort, and ripe j for, if 
they are ripe, or towards it, they will foon 
foften 5 and if you put two Sorts together, 
one will be in Pulp very foon, and the o- 
ther will be hard for an Hour or two, and 
at length will not be foft. Memorandum^ 
This is not to be difregarded.

To make Tafie, From Mrs, Peafly. 

THERE are many forts of Pafte made, 
and among them, are fome which are 
made with Eggs, according to the old fafhion; 
but thefe are always hard, when they are 
baked, though they will fly and crackle in 
the Mouth, but they tafte like Sticks : while, 
on the other fide, leave out your Eggs, and 
ufe Butter and Water only, as in the fol- 
lowing Receipts, and your Pafle will melt 
in the Mouth, and be agreeable to the I afiC. 

If you would have a fweet Pafte 5 then, 
take half a Pound of Butter, and rub it into 
about a Pound of Flour, with two or three 
Ounces of double refined Sugar powdered, 
and make it a Pafte, with cold Milk, fome 
Sack and Brandy. This is a very good one. 

You may alio make an hot Pafte, for 
minced Pyes, or fuch like, by taking a quan- 
tity of Flour as you like, and break a Pound 
or two of Butter into a large Sauce-pan of 
Water J and when the Butter is melted, 
make an hollow in the midft of the Flour, 
and fcumming off the Butter, throw it, at 
times, into the Flour, with fome of the 
boiling hot Water along with it,- then, 
when you have enough for your ufe, work 
it into a ftifF Pafte, and lay it before the 
Fire, covered with a Cloth, and cut off 
fuch bits as you want, juft when you are 

goin§ 



128 The Country Ladys 

going to ufe them. This Pafte does very 
well for raifed Pyes. Some will make this 
Pafte by breaking in a Pound of Butter in* 
to a quarter of a Peck of Flour, and then 
pouring on it fome fcalding hot Water, 
enough to work it to a ftifF Pafte. As for 
Tarts, one may make the following PufF- 
Pafte. Rub in fome Butter into your Flour, 
and make it into a Pafte with Water, and 
when it is moulded, roll it out till it is a- 
bout half an Inch thick 5 then put bits of 
Butter upon it, about half an Inch afunder, 
and fold your Pafte together, and then fold 
it again : then roll it again till it becomes 
of the thicknefs it was before 5 and then lay 
bits of Butter on it, as before direded, and 
fold it as mention d above, and roll it again 
to the thicknefs of half an Inch 5 then put 
on the reft of your Butter, and fold it up, 
and roll it for the laft time, doubling it, 
and roiling it twice, before yoa ufe it. This 
is very good for Puffs, Puddings, or Petty- 
Patees. 

As for Meat-Pyes, or Pafties, they require 
another fort of Pafte, which is made thus. 
Rub feven Pounds of Butter into a Peck 
of Flour, but not too fmall 5 then make it 
into a Pafte with Water. It is good for 
Vcnifon-Pafties, and fuch like great Pyes.

is caird a Bifque of Fifh. 

To boil Frejb Salmon. 

IF you have frefh Salmon, you wafh it 
with Salt and Water, and according to 
the Fafhion, leave all the Scales on, though 
fome take them off, to prevent that trouble 
at the Table, for the Skin of the Sairnon 
is the fatteft part of the Fifh, and is liked 
by liioft People. Lay your Fifh thus prepared, 
into the Pan, where you boil it, and pour 
in Water, with a fixth part of Vinegar, a 
little Salt, and a ftiek of Horfe-Radifli 5 this 
fhould be boiled pretty quick : thus far for

then let the Sauce be as follows. Take a 
Pint of Shrimps, a Pint of Oyfters and their 
Liquor, and half a Pint of pickled Mufh- 
rooms ; or elfe take Shrimps, and the Bodies 
of two middling Sea-Crabs, or of a couple 
of Lobfters, the Tail of the Lobfters to be 
cut in Dice, but ufe which you have by you- 
If you have Oyfters, ftew them a little, in 
their own Liquor, with fome Mace, and 
whole Pepper, then lay by the Oyfters, and 
put Mufnroom Pickle to the Liquor, and 
diffolve two Anchovies in it 5 then melt 
what quantity of Butter you think fit, and 
mix your prepared Liquor with it, adding 
a little White Wine, or that may be left 
out. I fhould take notice, that juft before 
you melt your Butter, put your Oyfters, 
Shrimps, and Mufhrooms, &c. into your 
prepared Liquor to boil up, and then mix 
all together. NotCy The Bodies of the Crabs 
being well ftirred in the Liquor, will thicken 
it, and render the whole very agreeable. 

To boil Turbut, Flounders, or Plaifc, Pike, 
or a Cod's-Head, or Whitings. 

WHEN your Pifti are gutted and well 
wafh'd : put them upon your Filh- 
Plate^ the Jacks or Pikes, whether fmall 
or great, muft have their Tails skewer'd 
into their Mouths, fo that they make a round

an Onion, with fome Cloves iluck in it,

bunch of fweet Herbs, a flick of Hor fe-Raci ifh, 
and half a Lemon. When your Liquor boils, 
add a little Vinegar, or Verjuice 5 and when 
your Filh are boiled enough, let them drain 
before the lire. The Sauce for thefe, if they 
are ferved fingly, is that directed for the Sal- 
mon, or elfe fome melted Butter, Ancho- 
vies diflblved in Water, over the Fire, and 
fome Shrimps, or for want of them, if you 
can get any of the fmall Crabs, fuch as they 
fell in hondorii about eight or ten a PcnnV;^ 
and no bigger in their Bodies than to con- 
tain the quantity of a Golden-Pippin. Take 
the Infide of the Bodies of thefe, and thicken 
your Sauce with them. Or if you have 
Crav-fifh, take the Bodies of them^ and 
mix them well with your Sauce, and cut 
I the Tails in fmall bits, as big as Pcafe. The 
foregoing way of boiling Filh gives them a 
relifh. 

To fry Soles, iFlounders, Plaife, Whitings, 
SmeltSj and Gudgeons, or fucb like, 

TAKE a large quantity of Hog's- Seam, 
or Lard, and melt it in a Pan, till it 
is very hot 5 then put in your Fiih, prepa- 
red as follows : but firft you may fry fome 

K 2 Bread 



132 ^e Country Ladys 

Bread, in Lengths, as big as one's Fing^, 
to drain for a Garnifti. 

As for Soles, skin them, and gut them^ 
then flour them well, and tofs them into 
the Pan, turning them once, when you fee 
the upper fide of a yellow Colour. When 
they are enough, putthemintoa CuUendar 
to drain before the Fire. 

Flounders are only to be gutted, and the 
Skins wafh'd with Water and Salt, and be- 
ing well dry'd with a Cloth, flour them^ 
and fling them into the Pan, and ufe them 
as you did the Soles. 

The Piaife are to be done in the fame 
manner as the Flounders. 

Whitings muft be treated in the fame 
manner as the former. 

Smelts muft be only rub'd with a coarfe 
Cloth, and then flour'd, and thrown into 
the Pan, 

Gudgeons muft be fcaled and gutted, well 
dry'd and flour'd, and thrown into the hoc 
Lard : but take care in all thefe that you 
have a quick Fire under them, and not too 
aiLiany in the Pan at one time. 

You have now all your Furniture for yout

To broil Whitings, 

CLEAN your Whitings, with Water 
and Salt, after they are gutted, and dry- 
ing them thoroughly, flour them well, then. 
lay them on the Grid-Iron, firft rubbing it 
with a little Chalk. As you find them e^ 
nough on one fide, turn them, and ferve 
them, if they go to the Table alone, with 
Butter melted, fome Anchovy Liquor, and

To preferve Grapes in Syrup. From the 

fame, 

TH E befl Grapes for this ufe, are thofc 
of the Fronteniac Kind, of which 
there are the white and the blue, and the 
red, which feldom come to ripen in Eng- 
landy with their pure flavour. But as Heat 
is the occafion of ripening, fo, though they 
want it with us, from the Sun, we may 
make good that deficiency by Fire, which 
will anfwcr the end fully, and bring them 
tothchigheft perfedion of Tafte 5 therefore

the Swect-mcat made of thefe is excellent ; 
befides thefe Grapes for preferving, the St. 
Teter and the Warner Grapes are very 
good, and I may mention the grizled Fron- 
teniac, which is a noble Grape, when it is 
ripe, as well as the others. And for the 
other Sorts of Grapes, they are not fit for 
preferving, unlefs I take in the Raifin 
Grapes, red and white, and xhc Lombardy 
Grapes all which are full of Pulp, andfel- 
dom ripen. Thefe are your forts, and now 
to proceed. 

Take your Crapes, gather'd in a dry Day, 
though they are not ripe. You may guefs 
when we come to the end of September^ 
and they are not fo, they never will be 
ripe : pick them then from the Stalks, and 
ftone them carefully, without breaking 
much of the Skin, fave the Juice i then 
take the weight of them in fine Sugar 
powder 'd, and boil your Sugar with fome 
Water, wherein Pippins have been boiled 
before, firft flraining your Water, and boil 
them to Syrup, taking off the Scum as it 
rifes. And when the Scum rifes no more, 
put in your Grapes, and boil them quick 
till they are as clear as Gryftal, 1 mean the 
white Grapes 5 but the red Sorts, let them 
boil till they are clear, and that the Syrup 
will jelly i then put them into Glafles, and 
when they are cold, cover them clofe with 

white

white Paper 5 but mark your Papers, which 
are of the Fronteniac Kinds, for they will 
have a very different Flavour from the other 
Sorts, an high richnefs that is much admi- 
red. However, though the other Kinds of 
Grapes, mention d in this Receipt, may want 
a flavour by thcmfelves, you may add fo me 
Orange-Flower- Water to the Syrup, you 
make for them, which will give them a 
fine tafte.

equally with the Apples j for the Quince is 
of a tough Nature, and will not boil un- 
der twice the time that the Apples will : 
therefore to grate them, will be enough to 
give their flavour to the Apple, and make 
all enough at one time. Put what Sugar 
you think proper into each Dumpling, whea 
you take it up, and the neceifary quantity

the Ribs. This, as a luigle Rabbit, has the 
Spit pafs'd through the Body and Head, but 
the Skewer takes hold of the Spit to pre- 
ferve the Haunclies. But to trufs a couple 
of Rabbits, there are feven Skewers, and 
then the Spit paffes only between the Skew- 
ers, without touching the Rabbits.
