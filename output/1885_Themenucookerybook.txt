This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject

PREFACE. 



" What shall we have for dinner ? " is frequently 
the question put to herself by each young house- 
keeper, before giving her orders for the evening 
meal. I have collected the recipes given in this 
book with the sincere hope that they may in some 
way help my young friends ; many of them have 
been tried at my own table. I have endeavoured 
as far as possible to make the recipes economical, 
although good and tasty, and to bring them within 
the means of smaller as well as larger incomes. 
There is, of course, a great deal in the cooking of 
food. Recipes may be good, but if a cook is careless 
and dirty, and boils her meat when it ought only to 
be simmered, thus rendering it hard and tasteless, 
the best things will be spoilt. Also, in my opinion, 
there is a great deal in the serving of dishes. Food 
is far more tempting to eat if neatly and prettily 
served. A large number of cutlets thrown all over 
a big dish, cut all sizes, are not elegant to look at ; 
whereas, if you have them neatly ^\i«b^^^^^^^ VsNa^^

IV ' PREFACE. 

browned, and then formed into a crown on the dish, 
with gravy round, and any small vegetable in the 
centre, they will certainly be more pleasing to the 
eye ; so with all dishes. All superfluous fat, too, is 
best removed from such joints as loins or necks of 
mutton and lamb, before roasting or boiling. -. It is 
less wasteful than leaving it on, for it can be care- 
fully rendered down and used for common pastry, 
frying, and many other purposes. The embossed 
papers are very cheap at all the stores, and are 
most useful in serving up many dishes. Cooks 
must be taught to keep all bones for the stock-pot. 
Any small bits of skin cut from cutlets or chops, all 
game and meat bones, should also be used in this 
way. If simmered gently with vegetables and water 
for some hours, they will in all households be found 
most useful as a foundation for soups and sauces ; 
with the addition of a 4d5. packet of Nelson's extract 
of meat, a quart of soup may be made at a very 
small expense. Cooking is much taught now, and 
most useful it must often prove, for we should cer- 
tainly know how to do a thing before attempting to 
teach or even tell others about it. My book is sup- 
plied with a hundred menus, comprising dinners for 
parties of 2 to 16 people. Of course some of the 
dishes repeat themselves ; it would be impossible to 
prevent that, but no two menus are alike. Each 
dish, in every menu, is numbered ; it is therefore 
only necessary to turn to the number in the book, 



PREFACE. V 

where tlie recipe how to cook or make it will be 
found. 

I can stiHjnglj recommend to all my friends, or 
any one who buys my book, the use of Nelson's 
gelatine before any other ; indeed all his things are 
very good. Also Berwick's baking powder— few 
cakes or puddings should be made without a little 
of it ; Yeatman's yeast powder for bread ; also Fry's 
cocoa and chocolates for making sweets or cocoa to 
drink.

REMARKS ON SOUPS. 

Have all pans used for boiling sonp perfectly clean, 
even to the inside of the cover and the rim. Wash 
the meat a little in cold vrater, and prepare all 
vegetables very carefully. Alvrays strain off your 
soup vrhen it is boiled ; never leave it to stand in 
the same vessel it has been boiled in. The bones of 
fresh meat, necks of poultry, shank bones of mutton, 
and the liquor in vrhich meat has been boiled, will 
all do to add to the stock pot, and should all be 
carefully kept for it. Skim well when first soup 
begins to boil ; a little salt, or cold water, thrown 
in, will help to bring the scum to the top. After it 
has come well to the boil and been skimmed, draw 
the pan back and let it simmer gently, but without 
ceasing, until it is done. When meat or vegetables 
have been fried or browned first, boiling water 
should be put on to them ; otherwise cold water is 
best. A small proportion of sugar, about an oz. to 
a gallon, will very much improve the flavour of stock 
for soup. The proportion of salt should be 1| oz. 
to a gallon of soup. No particle of fat should ever 
be seen on soup when it is sent to table, therefore 
make the stock the day before, and when cold take 
ofB every bit of fat. Serve soup, sauee^, VcA'Si^^ ^J^ 
dishes, aa hot aa possible.

Julienne Soup. 1. 

Cut into pieces some spring carrots, tximips, 
green onions, celery, leeks, parsley, the tops of a 
bunch of sweet herbs, spinach, and lettuce, add a 
pint of fresh green peas, stew the whole till tender 
in 3 quarts of good veal stock. Then pass it 
through a tamis cloth. If not clear enough, beat 
up the white and shell of an egg, stir it in well ; 
set it on the fire to boil for five minutes, then pass 
it again carefully through the tamis cloth, or a 
jelly bag. Put it again on the fire, and add half a 
pint of asparagus tops which have been scalded. 
Simmer till the asparagus is tender, then serve. 
Half a glass of sherry can be added if liked, and 
some colouring if required. If preferred not quite 
clear, the vegetables can be rubbed through a tamis 
cloth, and returned to the soup. 

Mock Turtle Soup. 2. 

Take a cleaned calf's head, boil it till three parts 
done in 2 or 3 quarts of water ; take it out and cut 
the best pieces off the bones. Strain the liquor, 
add to it 3 quarts of good veal broth, the bones and 
rough parts of the head, also 4 cloves, 2 onions, a 
little mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, and pepper and 
salt. Boil all for an hour. Strain and thicken 
with flour and butter, add the pieces of meat which 
were cut off. Put in some fried forcemeat and egg 
balls, simmer gently; before serving add a little 
lemon juice, and half a pint of boiling sherry wine. 

Good Gravy Soup. 3. 

Take about 6 lbs. of shin of beef, cut the meat 
off the bones into small square pieces, roll them in 
flour. Put about 2 oz. of butter into a saucepan, 
let it get quite hot, add the pieces of meat by 
degrees, stirring it now and then, but do not set it 
quite over the fire ; let it do gently ior about half 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 6 

an houi» until the meat looks bix)wn and the gravy 
is drawn ont, then pnt in a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 
onions, 2 large carrots, 2 turnips, a head of celery, 
1^ oz. of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, 6 cloves, 
and a blade of mace ; add the bones of the beef, 
sawn into small pieces, and pour over all a good 
gallon of boiling water ; let it all simmer gently for 
6 hours or rather more. Strain, put by to get cold. 
When wanted, take off every bit of fat, serve with 
small pieces of macaroni in it, or bits of vegetables 
cut neatly. If wanted to be quite clear, the beaten 
white of an egg and the shell can be put to it, after 
it has been cleared of the fat ; set it on the fire, let 
it boil for five minutes, then strain through a flannel 
bag. The meat, bones, vegetables, etc., can be left 
in the saucepan, from 2 to 3 quarts of cold water 
put to them, let them boil for a little, then draw the 
pan back, and simmer for some time. This, when 
strained, will make common soup or good stock. 

GiBLET Soup. 4. 

Stew the giblets till tender in a pint of water, 
add half an onion, 2 or 3 cloves, a few black pepper- 
corns, and a small bunch of sweet herbs. Take 3 
pints of good and well seasoned stock, set it on the 
fire to get hot. Put 2 dessert-spoonfuls of cornflour 
into a basin, stir it with a little browning until it 
is about as thick as cream, then pour it into the 
soup and give it a good stir round, leaving it to 
thicken by the fire ; add a little cayenne, a wine- 
glass of white wine, a little Worcester sauce, and 
salt to taste. Let it boil, and remove any scum 
that may rise; then strain into it the liquor the 
giblets were boiled in, also put in all the best 
pieces of giblets. Serve hot. When cayenne is 
used, it is always better to rub it smooth in a litUft 
of the soup first, for if thrown in, it i^ o^t \,o Tj^xaajav 
in lumps. 



MEXU COOKERY BOOK. 

Ox Tail Soup. 5. 

Tako some stock, made from beef (or bones and 
vegetables well boiled together and then strained) ; 
allow this to be cold and free from all fat. Take 2 
ox tails, soak them in enough water to cover them, 
take them out and cut into joints ; put them on the 
fire again in the same water, adding a slice or two 
of ham, and stew them gently till tender. Take as 
much of your stock as you require for soup, strain 
into it what the ox tails have been stewing in, add 
all the best pieces of the tails, a glass of port wine, 
pepper, salt, and a little ketchup ; thicken with a 
little flour, or cornflour, and, before serving, add a 
dozen forcemeat balls which have been fried. 

Habb Soup. 6. 

Take the remains of a hare which has been roasted 
the day before, add to it a few bits of parsley, a 
stick of celery, a bunch of sweet herbs, also about a 
quart of water or weak stock. Simmer gently until 
the meat is nearly o£E the bones, strain and thicken 
it with a little cornflour, or flour and butter ; pick 
the meat off the bones, rub this well through a hair 
or fine wire sieve, add it to the soup with pepper, 
salt, and half a glass of port wine. 

Rabbit Soup. 7. 

Cut two rabbits into small pieces. Put 2 oz. of 
butter into a saucepan ; flour and season the pieces 
of rabbit. When the butter is hot, put in the 
pieces, with 2 small onions, 1 carrot, 1 turnip, a 
stick of celery, all cut in small pieces, a few cloves, 
pepper, and salt ; let all brown well together, but 
not bum. Pour on to it some hot stock made from 
bones, and free from fat (about 2 quarts). Stew 
gently for an hour or more •, stram i\\e ^ovx-^^ Vi^Lvei^ 



MENU COOKERlr BOOiC. 6 

out some of the best pieces of the rabbit. Thicken 
the sonp with 2 desert-spoonfuls of cornflour, mixed 
first into a smooth paste ; add half a glass of port 
wine, the juice of a lemon, or a little currant jelly ; 
put in the pieces of rabbit, warm up well and serve. 

Fowl or Chicken Soup. 8. 

Have ready about 2 quarts of stock from veal 
bones, put to it some vegetables, carrot, onion, 
celery, parsley, and sweet herbs. Take a fowl, or 
chicken, cut it into four pieces and put it into the 
stock ; boil, or simmer gently till tender. Strain 
the soup, add to it half a pint of thin cream and the 
beaten yolks of 2 eggs, pepper and salt to taste. 
Cut some of the best meat off the fowl in neat 
pieces, or joints, and add them also. Warm well 
and serve. The eggs and cream will thicken it if 
allowed to simmer for a little. A chicken, if young, 
will not require to stew so long as the vegetables. 

Game Soup, 9. 

Take any game too old for roasting, a couple of 
partridges, or 8 moorfowl. Stew them well and 
slowly in about 3 pints of stock. When tender, take 
them out, cut off some of the best pieces, return the 
rest to the soup ; add pepper, salt, a little ketchup, 
and some thickening, either flour and butter or 
some cornflour. Let thip simmer gently while you 
prepare the pieces you have cut off. Take these 
pieces, trim them neatly, season well, wash each 
over with cream, shake a- little flour over and fry a 
nice brown, but don't let them be greasy. Strain 
the soup through a sieve, rubbing as much of the 
meat through from the game as you can ; return 
the soup to the pan, put in the fried pieces oi ^«xcl^« 
Make it verj hot, and serve.

De Cbessy Soup. 10. 

Wash clean and cnt small 8 carrots, 6 turnips, 
3 heads of celery, and 3 onions ; pnt them in a stew- 
pan with 3 oz. of bntter and a slice of ham. Stew 
p^ently for an hour, stirring constantly when they 
begin to bix)wn. As soon as they are nicely browned, 
add 2 or 3 qnarts of beef stock, or from bones. 
Let it boil till the vegetables are soft, then pnlp all 
thix)ngh a sieve ; put it on the fire again, and boil 
for a quarter of an hour ; season with pepper and 
salt, and serve. This soup should be as thick as 
melted butter. 2 lbs. of beef boiled in 4 quarts of 
water and reduced to 3 quarts, will answer for the 
stock. 

Mulligatawny Soup. 11. 

Take one good rabbit, or fowl, cut up neatly, put 
the best pieces in a stewpan with a little butter, 
let them stew gently and bi'own until they become 
tender. Have some stock, about 3 pints, made from 
bones, but not dark in colour, mix into it three des- 
sert-spoonfuls of curry powder, the rest of the fowl 
or rabbit, a large onion, celery, pepper, and salt. 
Simmer gently for some time, then strain ; add the 
pieces of fried meat, and let it simmer a little 
longer. Put into it last thing a small cup of cream. 
Should the soup be liked very hot, a little more 
curry powder can be added with the cream. Boiled 
rice should be sei*ved with it. 

White Soup. 12. 

Cut the meat from a knuckle of veal, break up 
the bones, stew with 3 quarts of cold water to 5 lbs. 
of meat, clear it from scum, add 1^ oz. of salt, 2| 
oz. of onions, 20 white peppercorns, 2 blades of 
mace, and a little cayenne pepper ; when the soup 
is reduced to one-third, having simmered slowly, 
strain it off and let it get cold, free it carefully 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 7 

from fat, and put it into a clean sancepan. Take 2 
table-spoonfuls of cornflour, mix it smooth with \ 
a pint of cream, pour it into the soup, and let it 
simmer gently by the side of the fire to thicken. A 
little macai*oni, soaked in milk and cut into neat 
pieces, can be added. If wanted richer, more cream 
and a couple of the beaten yolks of eggs may be 
used. Some cooks use 1 or 2 oz. of Jordein almonds, 
blanched and pounded, boiled in a little stock and 
rubbed through a sieve and added to the soup. 

Vegetable White Soup. 13. 

Take any thin stock from veal bones or white 
meat, about 2 quarts, add to it 4 sticks of celery, 2 
turnips, 1 onion, boil till the vegetables are tender, 
strain, keeping back a few pieces of celery. Set it 
over the &*e again, add salt, pepper, a bit of loaf 
sugar, 3 dessert-spoonfuls of cornflour mixed in a 
little cold milk, a few small pieces of celery, and let 
it simmer and thicken ; just before serving, put in a 
small cup of thin cream. 

Mutton Broth. 14. 

Take a neck of mutton, about 6 or 7 lb., cut ofE 
6 of the chops from the best end, break up the rest

well for two or three hours, then strain ; let it get 
cold, and take off the fat ; keep a few pieces of the 
vegetables, and some of the pearl barley, and put 
them back into the soup. Take the 6 chops, cut them 
neatly and free from fat, fry them slightly in a little 
butter, but not to let them be hard, put them into 
the soup, and simmer the whole gently togethftY tot 
three-quarters of an hour.

Sheep's Head Soup. 15. 

Take a sheep's head, stew it in 4 quarts of water 
with carrots, turnips, celery, parsley, and onions, a 
J of a lb. of pearl Tbarley well washed, some whole 
pepper, cloves, and salt. Stew well and gently till 
all is done, let the head be qnite tender, take it out

Potato Soup, No. 2. 17a. 

Peel and cnt in slices 8 large potatoes ; put into a 
pan which has been rubbed with butter at the 
bottom, a few slices of ham and the potatoes ; let 
them warm well, but not brown, then pour in rather 
over a quart of stock ; boil till the potatoes are 
tender, pass through a sieve, return to the pan, 
season to taste, and last thing add a cupful of milk 
and cream mixed. 

Green Pea Soup. 18. 

Take a quart of green peas, a stick of celery, an 
onion, and turnip, all cut, some mint, and about a

have ready about a pint of young green peas par- 
boiled in water with a little mint, add them to the 
soup, and let the whole simmer until tender, then 
serve. 

Common Pea Soup. 19. 

3 table-spoonfuls of pea flour, mix it in a basin 
with enough cold broth to make it smooth like a 
paste. Take a quart of broth, boil it, and pour it 
boiling over the paste, stirring all the time ; return 
it to the saucepan, add pepper, salt, and very finely 
dried mint. Broth that bones and vegetables have 
been boiled in will do for this, or even that left from 
boiled salt beef, if not too salt. 

Vegetable Soup. 20. 

3 turnips, 2 onions, carrots, a lettuce, 3 sticks of 
celery, a little mint, parsley, and a cup of rice.

put all over the fire to get quite hot. Salt and 
popper should be added to taste. 

Cheap White Soup. 21. 

Boil knnckle-bone of veal and ham-bone, 3 onions, 
3 sticks of celery, salt and pepper, in 3 quarts of 
water for 6 hours ; skim well, strain, and leave to 
get cold ; remove all the fat. Take | a lb. of rice, 
boil it till tender in a little of this stoKck, pass it all 
through a haii* sieve, rubbing as much of the rice 
through as possible, add as much more stock as you 
require for your soup, and put it in a saucepan on 
the fii*e. Beat the yolk of 1 egg, put to it ^ a pint 
of thin cream, add this to the soup, and make it 
quite hot. 

Tapioca Soup. 22. 

Have ready about 3 pints of good and delicately 
flavoared beef stock. Wash 2 oz. of the best tapioca 
in water, put it on the fire with half of the stock, 
heat together very slowly until the tapioca is very 
clear and partly dissolved, then add the rest of the 
stock, and the yolks of 2 eggs beaten. 

Carrot Soup. 23. 

Clean and cut 6 or 8 carrots into slices, fry them 
in butter with 2 onions sliced, a little sugar, and 
. some parsley. Take a quart of good stock, put it on 
the fire, throw in the carrots, onions, etc., boil till 
quite tender, then rub them through a hair sieve or 
tammy, add the pulp to the soup till it is as thick 
as good cream. If the carrots are small, 10 or 12

Oyster Soup. 24. 

Allow about 3 dozen to a quai't of soup. Open 
them carefully, keep and strain the liquor from

them, beard the oysters, and put the strained liqnor 
over them. Take a quart of the palest veal stock, 
and simmer the beards in it for twenty minntes ; 
strain, adding a little more stock if required. Put 
the oysters over the fire in their own liquor to plump 
them, but do not let them boil. Put the soup over 
the fire, add mace and cayenne, pour the liquor from 
the oysters to it and a pint of cream quite hot, put 
the oysters into the tureen, and pour the soup over 
them and serve. Should any thickening be re- 
quired, a dessert-spoonful of cornflour, mixed quite 
smooth with a little milk, and then added by degrees 
to the soup (letting all simmer together a little) will 
thicken it ; but it should be added before the cream. 
It is better to boil all cream alone before adding it 
to soups. 

Superior Hare Soup. 26. 

Cut up a hare into joints, put it into a stew- 
pan with 1 lb. of lean ham cut in thick slices, 
2 small onions, 3 or 4 cloves, 2 blades of mace, a

Good Plain White Soup. 30. 

6 potatoes, 4 onions, 4 oz. crushed tapioca, 1^ 
pints of milk, a little butter, salt, and pepper. Cut 
up the potatoes and onions, put them into 2 quarts 
of boiling water ; boil for three-quarters of an hour, 
rub the vegetables through a sieve, put back the 
potato paste into the water again, add the butter, 
salt, and pepper, then boil the 4 oz. of tapioca for 
twenty to twenty-five minutes in the soup, add the 
milk, and, when fully heated, serve. This will 
make about 2 quarts of soup. 



REMARKS ON COOKING FISH. 



Fish must always be well washed before cooking, 
and thoroughly cleaned. For frying, it is best 
washed in cold water, rubbed with salt, dried and 
rolled in a cloth. Cod and salmon when fried 
should be cut thick. Soles may be cooked either 
whole or in fillets. In all frying, either with oil, 
fat, or lard, care should be taken that the lard be 
quite boiling before the things to be fried in it are 
put in. If the cook is not quite sure if it is boiling, 
she had better try first with a small bit of bread ; 
if that browns at once, the fish can be put in at 
once ; for if lard or butter is not hot enough, it will 
soak into the fish, meat, etc., and quite spoil it. 
This applies to rissoles, croquettes, etc., as well aa 
to fish. Many people like fried fish to eat cold, in 
which case it must be crisp, well fried, but not over 
done, and served with a little piquante sauce. When 
fish is fresh, the gills are red, the eyes bright ; if the 
gills are blue and the fish flabby, it should not be 
used. All boiled fish should have salt in the water 
it is to be boiled in, from 4 to 6 oz. to the gallon 
of water. Salmon is in season from February to 
August ; it can be bought at other times, but it is 
dearer ; codfish from October to March, in greatest 
perfection at Christmas. Mackerel, whiting, etc., 
if boiled, only require 4 oz. of salt to a gallon of 
water. Clarified dripping, or even good dripping, 
will do for frying things in, as well as lard.

To Boil a TimBor. 31. 

A moderate sized one will take twenty minutes to 
boil, a large one lialf an hour ; this is after it gets 
to the boil. Clean very well in two or three waters. 
Dissolve (in a well-cleaned fish-kettle, in as much 
cold water as will cover the fish well) salt, allowing 
4 oz. to a gallon of water ; lay the turbot in, having 
the white side upwards ; bring it slowly to the 
boil ; take off the scum as it rises. Let the water 
simmer until the fish is done, then lift it out, drain, 
and slide it gently on a very hot dish. Serve with 
rich lobster sauce. 

Turbot 1 la Cr^me. 32. 

Take carefully from the bones the flesh of a cold 
turbot; take off all the skin, and cut into neat 
pieces. Mix some cream sauce (from Recipe 257), 
heat the fish in this, but do not boil it. Send to 
table with a wall of mashed potatoes round it, or 
covered with fine bread crumbs, moistened with 
clarified butter, and browned with a salamander. 

To Boil Salmon. 33. 

Scale and clean very carefully, wiping all the 
blood out from the inside. Some cooks put salmon 
into boiling water to set the curd ; but it is wiser to 
put it into water which is just warm, allowing 6 oz. 
of salt to a gallon of water ; take the scum off when 
it rises. A small fish may boil rather fast, but a 
thicker one is best boiling slower. From 2 to 3 lb. 
will take about half an hour. Salmon is best well 
done. Do not allow any fish to remain in the water 
after it is boiled ; lift it out on the fish drainer, put 
it across the kettle, putting over it a clean cloth 
that has been dipped in boiling water and wrung 
out ; just before Ashing it up, dip the fish again 
into the water in the fish-kettle, which must be kept

simmering all the time, so that it may not be cold 
when sent to table. 

To Boil Codfish. 34. 

The head and shoulders of this fish is considered 
to be the handsomest piece, although the middle cut 
has more on it. Wash the fish well, cleaning the 
backbone carefully. Put it into cold water with 
6 oz. of salt to a gallon of water. Put the fish-kettle 
over a modei-ate fire, skim well when it boils, then 
boil gently till done. Some put rather less salt and 
a pinch of saltpetre. A small piece will take from 
twenty to thii-ty minutes, a large fish nearly an hour 
or more. Serve with oyster sauce, or with the 
" Parson's Fish Sauce," given in Eecipe 246. 

Fried Slices of Cod or Salmon. 35. 

Cut the middle or tail end into slices, a little over 
half an inch thick ; season with salt and pepper, 
and egg and bread-crumb them, and fry a nice 
brown ; or they may be seasoned, floured, and fried 
plain — ^they will take about ten minutes to cook. 
The slices after they are fried can be put, if liked, 
to stand by the side of the fire in a good hot curried 
gravy for five minutes, which is an excellent way of 
flavouring them. Salmon can be fried in the same 
way as cod, and is very good for breakfast. 

Boiled Salt Fish. 36. 

If very salt, it is best left in cold water all night, 
or until the salt is drawn out and it becomes softer. 
Put it into plenty of cold water, let it heat very 
slowly for an hour, but never let it boil, as that will 
harden it ; it must simmer from half to three- 
quarters of an hour after it gets quite hot. The 
scum should be cleared off carefully. Served with 
egg sauce* 



menu cookery book. 17 

Fried Soles. 37. 

Skin, clean, and wash soles carefully. Do not 
take out the roes; fold them very carefully in a 
clean dry cloth until they are wanted, as they must 
not be at all wet. Brush them very well over with 
beaten egg, then dip them into very dry, fine bread 
crumbs. Have ready a clean frying-pan, with 
enough good lard in it to float the fish ; let this be 
quite boiling before the fish are put in ; they will 
take from nine to fifteen minutes to fry, according 
to size. Before frying the fish it is better to take 
them by the head and shake oSt any loose crumbs. 
When they are fided a nice colour on one side, pass 
a fish slice carefully under the fish, put a fork in 
the head, and turn them. They should be drained 
on paper. Soles sometimes are dipped in beaten 
egg, then perfectly covered with flour, and fried in 
boiling olive oil, and drained well. 

Filleted Soles. 38. 

Large soles are- the best for this. Divide down 
the middle of the back, then round the fins, and 
with a sharp knife raise the fish from the bones. 
One fish will make into four fillets ; these can be 
rolled up, egg, bread-crumb them, and fry in boiling 
lard. A pretty dish can be made by ha^ving 4 
fillets boiled and 4 or 6 fried, putting the white fish 
to stand in the centime of your dish and the fried 
round. Put a rich white sauce on the dish, but not 
over the fish. In boiling the fillets, have a little 
salt in the water, let it just come to the boil, then 
simmer gently for six to ten minutes. 

PiQUANTE Filleted Fish. 39.

hour before cooking, sprinkle with salt wcA ^e^^^-^^

common and taiTagon vinegar. When wanted, roll 
tight, put them in a saucepan with the liquor they 
wei-e in, add about a quarter of a pint of veal or 
white stock, -let them simmer ten minutes or more 
if thick. Take the fish out, put | a teaspoonful of 
coioifloui* mixed smooth with a little cream to the 
stock, also a teaspoonful or two of essence of an- 
chovy, the beaten yolk of an egg, and more pepper 
if required. Stir over the fire to get thick, pour 
over the fish, which must be kept warm, and sei*ve. 

Whitings Fried. 40. 

These fish are generally cleaned and skinned at 
the shop ; if not, they must be done by the cook. 
The tails should be fastened into the mouth ; brush 
them over well with egg beaten up, then dip in very 
fine bi*ead cinimbs, and fiy a nice brown in boiling 
lard, drain and diy well ; they will take from seven 
to ten minutes to fry. A little flour can be mixed 
with the bread crumbs. Serve fcvith anchovy or 
shrimp sauce. 

Baked Whitings. 41, 

Clean 4 or 6 whitings well, cut off the heads, 
season well with pepper and salt. Butter a 
pudding dish thickly at the bottom, lay in the 
fish, sprinkle them over with more butter, and 2 
table-spoonfuls of any light wine, cover with thick 
buttered paper, put them in a moderate oven for 
half an hour. Mix together 3 table-spoonfuls of 
sherry, 2 teaspoonfuls of finely chopped herbs, 1 
desert-spoonful of mushroom ketchup, 2 table-spoon- 
fuls of gravy, a little cayenne ; boil these together 
for a few minutes, pour over the fish, return them 
to the oven, and let them do slowly for half an hour 
more. 



menu cookery book. 19 

Mackerel. 42. 

K for boiling, open the fish enough to clean it 
well, also wash the ix>es well. Put salt into the 
water they are to be boiled in, put them on either 
in cold water, or just warm ; let them come gently 
to the boil, then simmer about a quarter of an hour, 
longer if they are large. Drain well before serving. 
These fish are best fried; cut o£E the heads and 
tails, clean very well, split them open and take out 
the backbone : some cooks take out all the bones, 
wipe the fish very diy, sprinkle salt and pepper 
over, flour the fish well, and fry in boiling lai'd ; 
drain well and serve. Mackerel may also be broiled 
on a gridiron over a clear fire, either split or whole ; 
or folded in buttered paper and then broiled. They 
may also be baked in the same way as whiting in 
the recipe given above. Care shotdd be taken to 
have mackerel always perfectly fresh, as they 
become unwholesome very soon if they ai-e not. 
When broiled they must be oiled or buttered. 

Haddocks Boiled. 43. 
Make them very clean. Scrape the outside, 
empty them, and wash well, take out the gills ; 
curl them round like whiting, or lay them flat in 
warm water with some salt in it. Let the water 
boil, skim it, then simmer for ten to twelve minutes. 
Serve very hot with anchovy sauce. 

Salt or Dried Haddock. 44. 

Put them on to a girdiron that has been rubbed 
with lard, heat them gently through, a little bit of 
butter can be rubbed on them to prevent their 
sticking to the gridiron. If for frying, put a little 
butter into a frying-pan, put in the haddock on the 
skin side, put a little more butter on the top of the 
fish, let it heat gently through for about ten to 
fifteen minutes.

Bed Mullet Broiled. 46. 

Wash it well, diy in a cloth ; it is not usually 
scaled or opened. Put it into buttered writing 
paper fastened tight at the ends ; broil it over a clear 
tire for about half an hour, or it can be baked in a 
modei-ate oven for the same time; take ofE the 
j)ai)er and serve very hot. Grey mullet is generally 
boiled ; if small, like boiled haddock, or fried like 
mackerel.

fresh ; draw them at the gills, but don't open them, 
dry well in a cloth ; dip them into beaten egg and 
fine bread cmmbs, into which mix a little flour. 
Fry in boiling lard or fat for five to ten minutes. 

Plaice. 48. 

This is a common fish, but when quite fresh is 
best cut into fillets, dried well in a cloth, flom-ed, 
then washed over with egg and covered with fine 
bread crumbs. Fry in plenty of boiling lard. This 
fish is firmer if spi'inkled with salt and left for two 
hours before cooking, then wash off the salt, and 
proceed as dii*ected. 



menu cookery book. 21 

Fresh Herrings. 49. 

These fish must be careftilly scaled and very well 
cleaned, splitting them down some way to be sure 
they are quite clean ; the roes must be left in. Dry 
them well in a cloth, flour them and fry a nice 
brown ; they will take about fifteen to twenty 
minutes. Some cooks cut off the heads and tails, 
split them open, and take out the backbones before 
frying. 

Salmon Fritters. 50. 

Take some flakes of cold salmon, shake pepper, 
salt, and chopped parsley over them. Make a batter 
to the proportion 2 large table-spoonfuls of flour, 1 
egg beaten ; add enough milk or cream to bring it to 
the consistency of thick cream. Dip in each piece 
of salmon, and drop it immediately into boiling lard 
or butter. Fry a nice brown ; they will take a very 
short time to fry. Drain, and serve on cut paper. 

Lobster or Salmon Cake. 51. 

Take some cold salmon, about 1 lb. or less, pick 
out all the bones and bits of skin ; put it into the 
mortar, add pepper, salt, and a little mace ; pound 
it very well with J of a lb. of bread crumbs, 3 ozs. 
of butter, and 2 eggs. Take a plain mould, butter 
it, sprinkle bread crumbs thickly over it, put in 
the fish, and bake or steam it from half to three- 
quarters of an hour; turn out, serve with white 
sauce round, into which a little tarragon vinegar 
can be put if liked. This may be made cheaper by 
putting rather less bread crumbs, and mixing in 2 
or 3 table-spoonfuls of good white sauce, instead of 
the butter and eggs. Lobster cake can be made the 
same way. The tinned fish may be used instead of 
fresh, only 'the oil or liquid must be drained from it 
first.

Beat the yolks and whites of 2 eggs separately, 
then together. Take a piece of salmon, or cold fish, 
about the size of an egg, pull it well into pieces 
with a fork, add a pinch of finely minced parsley, 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut, broken into 
small bits ; mix these well together. Take an 
omelette pan, put into it about 1 oz. of butter, let 
it melt but not brown ; pour in the mixture, stir 
with a flat spoon. The moment it begins to set, 
stop stirring, then with a spoon or ladle, double 
your omelette, keep shaking the pan till the ome- 
lette is a golden brown on one side. Turn it out 
into a very hot dish. 

Herrings Boned and Rolled. 57. 

Choose the herrings with roes ; split open, wash, • 
scrape, cut off the heads, and take out the roes; 
then with the thumb and finger of the right hand 
draw the backbones out. Sprinkle well with 
pepper, salt, and some finely chopped parsley, roll 
up tightly from the head. Have ready some

Rolled Herrings to Eat Gold. 58. 

Proceed as before, bnt omit the chopped parsley, 
and roll the roes np with the fish. Pnt the fish 
into a pie-dish. Mix a gill of water, about half 
that quantity of vinegar, salt, pepper, 2 or 3 cloves, 
1 or two bay leaves, pom* this over the herrings, 
cover the dish and place it in a moderate oven for 
an hour or two, some people like a very small bit of 
onion added. Serve cold with a little of the liqnor 
on the dish. The herrings shonld be nnder the 
mixture while cooking ; if not enough to cover them, 
add a little more vinegar and water. 

Stewed Fillets of Fish. 59. 

Take any cold fish (or fresh fish, if preferred), 
cut into very small fillets, fry lightly, add 3 or 4 
slices of onion, fry also. Take a saucepan, put in 
the fish, a few sweet herbs, and enough broth to 
cover it, add pepper, salt, a bit of mace, the onion, 
and a clove ; mix 2 teaspoonfuls of cornflour with 
enough milk to make it into a paste, and stir it in. 
Stew gently for twenty minutes (if fresh fish, it 
will require rather longer). Take out the fish, add 
a desert-spoonful of sherry to the gravy, or essence 
of anchovy ; give it a warm over the fire and strain 
over the fish. 

Cod Roes in Tomato Sauce. 60. 

Take 1 or 2 cod roes, according to size, wash well 
but do not break them. Boil till quite soft. Drain 
from the water, when cold cut in slices about half 
an inch thick. Take 1 oz. of butter, warm it over 
the fire in a clean pan, stir into it the yolks of 2 eggs 
he&ten, half a teaspoonf ul of salt, a Uttle cayenne, a

Put in the slices of roe, let them soak a fewminntes. 
Have a toast on a hot dish, put the slices on the 
toast, pour the sance over, and pnt the dish in the 
oven for a few minntes. Serve hot. 

Fried Cod Roes. 61. 

Prepare as above and cut when cold ; brush over 
the slices with egg or cream, dip them in bread 
cmmbs, to which should be added a little pepper 
and salt. Fiy a pale brown, serve with fried 
parsley ; or plain, and garnish with watercress. 

To Roast Pike. 62. 

A fish for this should not weigh less than 6 lbs. 
It is quite the best way to cook them. Take the 
pike, put into its throat a lump of salt about the 
size of a lemon, hang it by the head in a dry cool 
place for six or eight hours ; then wash and clean 
well. Have ready a good stuffing, the same as for 
veal or fowl. Fill the pike with this and sew it up. 
Fasten the tail into the mouth and put it into the 
oven in a baking tin, with some bits of butter on 
the top of it and a cup of thin cream or milk, a 
little thickened with flour, round it ; add pepper and 
salt to the milk ; baste frequently while roasting. 
It will take an hour or more, according to size, but 
should not be done too fast. Pour off the milk it 
has been basted with into a saucepan, add a pinch 
of sugar, some essence of anchovy, more cream and 
pepper, if necessary. Put the fish on a dish, give 
the sauce a good boil up, pour it over the fish very 
hot, and serve. 

Perch. 63.

and then proceed at once to scale them. Egg and 
bread-cmmb the fish after they have been washed 
and diied, and fry them, or fry plain for about ten 
minutes. They may also be stewed in a little stock, 
a table-spoonful of sherry, with pepper and salt, 
added. 

To Cook Eels. 64. 

These fish should be used at once ; some people 
even skin them before they are dead. Wash and 
clean very well. Cut them into neat pieces about 2 or 
3 inches long, par-boil them in some water that has 
been salted, dry them a little, and let them cool. 
Then roll them in flour, egg and bread-crumb them, 
fry in boiling lard, and serve with fried parsley. 
Some like them fried plain first, then stewed in 
some stock, in which some sherry wine should be 
put, also pepper, salt, a teaspoonful of vinegar, and 
a pinch of sugar; and thicken the sauce before 
serving with a little flour and butter. 

Lobster au Gratis. 65. 

Chop a small onion ; put into a stewpan 2 ozs. of 
butter, add the onion, fry a light brown. Take a 
small table-spoonful of flour, mix it quite smooth 
with half a pint of milk, add it by degrees to the 
butter and onion, also ^ a teaspoonful of salt, ^ of 
one of pepper, a pinch of cayenne, a bit of sugar, 
nutmeg, and chopped parsley. Let this simmer 
until it becomes rather thick ; cut a lobster into 
neat pieces, add to the same and simmer again 
for a quarter of an hour ; then add the beaten yolk 
of an egg, and 2 table-spoonfuls of cream, mixed 
together ; let it all thicken together a little longer. 
Fill your shells, sprinkle bread crumbs over, put a 
little clarified butter over just to moisten the 
crumbs ; put them in the oven for ten minutes ; pass 
a hot /Salamander over to bro^n. them, and serve.

Scalloped Oysters. 66, 

Open and beard about 18 to 24 oysters, strain the 
liquor and rinse the oysters well in it. Have some 
rich, thick, white sauce ready, stir the liquor into 
it, add pepper, cayenne, and a little mace if liked; 
put the oysters in, and let them warm well by the 
fire, but not boil, for four or five minutes. Put the 
mixture into the shells (scallop shells) ; cover the 
top thickly with bread crumbs fried a delicate 
brown and well dried ; or put on plain fine bread 
crumbs, pour clarified butter over, and brown with 
a salamander. Serve very hot. 

Trout. 66a. 

This fish must be very fresh, it should be well 
washed and cleaned, and fried plain The small 
fish are very good for breakfast, either fried or 
broiled. Salmon trout are larger and a pale pink in 
colour. These are better boiled, and served with a 
good fish sauce. 



REMARKS ON COOKING MEAT. 



Most cooks know how to roast all the common 
joints of beef, mutton, etc., I therefore will only 
make a few remarks on this subject. All meat 
should be hung as long as it will keep good before 
being cooked. Freshly-killed meat is tough and 
hard. Cooks often allow a quarter of an hour for 
each lb. of meat ; but this is not enough. For 
instance, 12 lbs. of sirloin of beef, roasted either 
before the fire or in the oven, will take from three 
to four hours if wished well done. No meat should 
do fast at first ; if in front of the fire, it should at 
first be some distance from the fire ; if in the oven, 
that should at first be cool, and allowed to get 
gradually warmer. Meat done quickly at first, 
shrinks up, gets hard outside, while the inside will 
not be properly cooked. Baste meat well while it is 
roasting, dredge flour over it at first, and sprinkle 
fine salt over it when it is nearly done. Veal, pork, 
and lamb should all be very well roasted ; and the 
meat of the two former being closer, it will be 
found that they take even longer to cook than beef 
or mutton. All meat should be kept in a cool dry 
place and where no fly can get to it ; if it becomes 
discoloured, scrape well, cut off any bits which are 
tainted, and pepper the joint well ; and before cook- 
ing it, wipe it over with a little vinegar. Frozen 
meat will never cook, without it is thoroughly 
thawed first. It can be put into a warm kitchen, 
some distance from the fire, for som.e hours until it 

?8 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 29 

gradually becomes soft. Some people put it into 
cold water. A thin joint will not take as long to 
cook as a fleshy one ; for instance, ribs of beef will 
not take so long as a piece of the round or rump, 
although the weight may be the same. All joints 
for boiling should be neatly trimmed, washed, and 
skewered firmly when they require it, put into a 
good-sized clean pan, and well covered with cold 
water, brought to a boil over a moderate fire, then 
pulled back and simmered well until done. All the 
scum must be carefully skimmed ofE ; it will rise as 
the water comes to the boil, and continue to do so 
for some little time. If the scum is left, it will 
sink and settle on the meat, and spoil its appear- 
ance. Vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, etc., 
may be boiled with meat. A small round of beef, 
weighing about 14 to 16 lbs., should be allowed 
from four to five hours for boiling. Beef, tongues, 
etc., are far better salted in a brine (recipe No. 678) 
instead of being rubbed over with salt and saltpetre, 
which is apt to make them hard. 

Stewed Beef. 67. 

A nice piece of the round or rump is the best for 
this. Take a piece of about 12 lbs., trim it neatly 
and. skewer it into a good shape, cut up 2 or 3 
onions, according to taste. Take a saucepan which 
will hold the beef well, put into it 2 oz. of butter ; 
let this melt, then add the onion and put in your 
beef. Cover the pan and let them simmer gradually 
together for three-quarters of an hour or more ; look 
at it carefully during the time, to see that it does 
not bum or stick to the pan, and turn it over so 
^that both sides may take a nice brown, and the 
gravy be drawn slowly from it. Then add some 
warm water, or some weak stock (also a, \\\^;\^ ^s^^o^ %

aboat two to three inches deep, add carrots, tnrmips, 
and a little celery, cnt into neat pieces. Let all 
this simmer gently together for three or four honrSf 
keeping your pan closely covered. About half an 
hour before serving, take out some of the broth, put 
it into a clean saucepan, stir into it a little thicken- 
ing (made of 3 good teaspoonf uls of cornflour, Qiixed 
smooth with a little browning), add pepper and 
ketchup, if liked; let it boil for a few minutes, 
leave it to simmer until you have dished your beef, 
then pour the hot gravy over it and put some neat 
pieces of vegetables round. Before thickening the 
gravy, be careful to take off all the fat. This may 
be done by holding bits of clean thin paper on 
the top of it; any fat swimming at the top will 
adhere to the paper, but it requires to be repeated 
three or four times before all the particles of grease 
are removed. 

Stewed Beef Steak. 68. 

This may be done in the same way as the beef, 
only it is perhaps better to brown the butter and 
onions a little before adding the steak. It will not 
take so long ; still, the slower the stewing is done, 
the more likely you are to have tender meat. Some 
prefer beef steak stewed with onions only, no other 
vegetables being added ; the gravy also can be 
made richer by stewing the steak in better stock, 
and adding flour and butter for the thickening 
instead of cornflour. 

Broiled Beef Steak, 69. 

Cat the steak about three-quarters of an inch 

thick from the best part of the rump. The fire 

must be very clear and hot. Make the gridiron hot, 

wipe it over with fresh mutton suet, lay on the 

steak; when nicely done on. one ^\^e, ^e^^^x \fc ^

little and turn it over, taking care to catch any 
gravy that may run from it. Salt it a little just as 
it is done, and add a little more pepper. If salt is 
put on at first it will harden the meat. Abont ten 
to twelve minutes will be enough time to do it in. 
Some people do not like steaks bi'oiled even as long 
as that. The dish on which the steak is served 
should be very hot. Sometimes a slice of butter, 
quite thin, is placed on the dish, and the hot steak 
put over it ; or, if liked with any flavour except its 
own, some mushroom ketchup can be warmed on 
the dish. A steak may be fried instead of broiled. 
Lay it in the frying-pan, which must be well rubbed 
over with dripping, dredge the steak with flour, and 
when half done pepper and salt can be added. It 
should be fried slowly at first, and will take fi-om 
fifteen to twenty minutes. Put the steak on to a 
very hot dish, and keep warm. Turn the fat out of 
the pan, put into it a little butter, stir in a largo 
teaspoonful of flour, brown it gently, and poui* in a 
cup of hot broth or stock ; shake the pan, add pep- 
per, salt, and some Worcester sauce. Poui* this 
over the steak and serve. 

A Fillet of Beef. 70. 

Out a good fillet from the inside of the sii'loin, 
take ofE some fat if there is too much on, and ti'im 
neatly ; roast it very gently, basting well with but- 
ter. Serve it with tomato sauce round, or with 
rich brown sauce, to which a little port wine and 
some button mushrooms have been added. 

Breakfast Beef. 71. 

Get a piece of the flat ribs, or the ribs of beef, 
bone it, and lay it on a deep dish. Mix together 4 
oz. of salt, 1 oz. of saltpetre, 4 oz, oi VinwyNTL ^-^^^ax^

all in powder ; mix very well together, and lay it 
on the beef, putting some on the dish nnder the 
beef ; keep it in this for a fortnight, turning it eveiy 
day. Wash all the spice ofF, roll up the beef tight. 
Bake it in a pan in a slow oven till quite tender. 
It must have some shred suet at the top while 
baking, and must be kept closely covered either 
with a common paste crust or a lid. When done, a 
fork should go easily into it. Take it out, cover 
with a plate, on which put a heavy weight to press 
it until it is qaito cold. Tongues may be cured and 
cooked the same way^ 

Lemon Beef. 72. 

Take about 12 to 16 lbs. of beef, either the round 
or ribs ; if the latter, bone it neatly. Mix together 
1 oz. of saltpetre, 4 oz. of brown sugar, and 12 oz. 
of salt ; lay it well over the beef. - Have 3 lemons, 
or 4 or 5 limes, cut them in slices, squeeze over 
the beef some of the juice out of each piece, then 
lay all the slices over the beef. When the liquor 
begins to run from this mixture, baste the beef with 
it once every day, and keep turning it every few 
days, so that each side may lie in the liquor some 
pai*t of the time. It should be kept in this pickle 
about a fortnight. Take it out, wipe it well, or 
pour a little cold water over it first if sticky ; put it 
into a saucepan, cover with cold water, let it come 
slowly to the boil, skim the water well. Let the 
beef simmer for two hours, take it out, wipe it dry, 
and put it in the oven to bake very slowly, putting 
some suet or a buttered paper on the top. It should 
cook very gradually for 3 to 4 hours, or until a fork 
will go into it quite easily, but the oven must not 
be hot to harden it on the outside. When done, 
press very well with heavy weights for twelve 
hours. To eat cold. It will keep good nearly a 
fortnight.

Beef Olives. 73. 

Take some pieces of lean beef, abont three incbes 
wide and four long ; beat them well to make them 
tender. Mix a little parsley, onion, and abont 6 or 
8 olives, all chopped very fine ; add salt, pepper, 
and a small bit of butter. Mix well, shake in about 
a handful of bread crumbs, bind with the yolks of 
1 or 2 eggs. Lay some of this mixture on each 
piece of beef ; roll them up, tie or fasten with a very 
small skewer. Put them into a stewpan. Just 
cover them with good stock, put a lid on to the pan, 
and let them stew very slowly for an hour and a 
half. About half an hour before they are done 
peel about 6 olives very thin, with a pointed knife, 
round and round to get the stone out (they should 
fall back into their old shape as they are done), put 
them in with the beef ; add a little pepper, salt, and 
a dessert-spoonful of port wine to the gravy before 
serving. The gravy can be thickened if liked. 
Cooked meat can be used instead of raw, which will 
not take as long to cook. A little browning can be 
added to the gravy. 



Brazilian Stew. 74. 

Half a lb. of lean beef, | a carrot, turnip, and onioU) 
peeled and cut into small pieces; mix together 1 
table-spoonful of vinegar, 2 of gravy (cold), J of a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a good bit of pepper. Cut 
the meat into neat pieces, dip each piece in vinegai*, 
place them in an eai-thenware jar, putting the other 
things on the top. Tie a piece of strong, gi*eased 
paper over the jar, and put it into a pan of cold 
water, place the pan on the fire, let it come to the 
boil, tiien stew for three or four hours very gently.

Red Beef. 75. 

To 12 lbs. of beef weigh ^ lb. of coarse brown 
sagar, 3 oz. of grotind pepper, 2 oz. of saltpetre, a 
teaspoonful of grated nxitmeg, and ^ a teaspoonfal 
of cloves ; mix all well together, and rub them well 
over the beef. Turn the beef and rub it well with 
the above for four days, once a day, and the fourth 
day put ^ a lb. of common salt over the beef. It 
must be in this pickle a fortnight or three weeks, 
taking care to turn it and baste it frequently. At 
the end of the time above named, wipe it free from 
all the spice, and put it into a tin that is used for 
collaring brawn. Put the tin into a rather deep 
baking-tin, pouring about 1 pint of water into the 
baking-tin, put some shred suet at the top of the 
beef and a tin plate over it. Bake it slowly until 
it is done, which you can tell by putting a skewer 
through it. Any way, it will take from three to 
four horn's. When cooked, put it aside, take off the 
tin plate, and leave a heavy weight on it for about 
twelve hours. Then take off the brawn tin and 
sei've. 

Bubble and Squeak. 76. 

Well wash some nicely grown cabbage, take off 
most of the outside leaves, only taking the firm in- 
side, boil well in salt and water, into which a small 
bit of carbonate of soda has been put ; when done, 
drain very well and chop up, mixing in pepper and 
salt. Take some thin slices of salt beef, fry them 
in the frving-pan, but not too much; keep them 
warm and fry the cabbage, turning it with a knife 
while doing. Pile the cabbage on a dish, putting 
the pieces of beef neatly over. Potatoes that have 
been left from the day before may be chopped 
and fried instead of cabbage, and served under the 
heef.

Hash of Stewed Beef. 77. 

Cut some neaty thin slices of cold stewed beef, 
trim free from skin or fat. Put 1 oz. of butter into 
a saucepan, let it boil, add a little chopped onion, 
some minced parsley, and sweet herbs. Stii' over 
the fire till a little browned, then stir in a dessei't- 
spoonful of flour, a little cayenne, grated nutmeg, 
and a small half-teaspoonful of salt; when these 
are a little coloured, add half a pint of stock. Let 
this boil gently for fifteen minutes, strain it, put in 
the meat, add a table-spoonf ul of mushroom ketchup, 
let it simmer gently till the meat is warmed through, 
but on no account let it boil. The yolk of an egg 
beaten may be added to the gi'avy if liked. Serve 
with sippets of toast round the hash. 

Minced Collops. 78. 

Mince very well about 1 lb. of raw beef ; it must 
be tender and free from all skin or fat. Season 
with salt and pepper. Put it into a saucepan and 
stir with a fork frequently while it heats, to pi*e- 
vent its gathering into lumps ; it must be perfectly 
smooth. Continue to simmer it gently for about a 
quarter of an hour ; if it gets too dry, add a small 
bit of butter and a table-spoonful -of gravy, but if 
properly cooked it should not require this. Serve 
in a silver dish with hot water under, as it should 
be served very hot. 

Roast Saddle, etc., of Mutton. 79. 

This joint is not considered to be economical ; but 
it is about the best joint of mutton if well hung and 
well roasted. The skin must be carefully cut off, 
and if there is too much fat, remove some of it, and 
fasten the skin on again with skewers. Remove 
also some of the fat round the kidney, ^wki "Oaa 
joint some distance from the fire at &:^\)^\i«*^\i^ "^

frequently and well ; about three-quarters of an 
hour before the saddle is done, remove the skin, and 
allow the fat to get brown, but on no account per- 
mit it to get the least bit burnt. Sprinkle a little 
salt over it just at the last ; dish it on a very hot 
dish and pour some good clear dark gravy round. 
All mutton requires to be sent in very hot, and with 
very hot dishes and plates, as the fat of mutton 
becomes soon cold, and looks very bad if it gets white 
and thick, caused by cold plates and dishes. A sad- 
dle of mutton will take from two and a half to three 
houi*s, if small. A saddle of lamb may be cooked 
the same way, and will take two and a half hours to 
roast. A leg of mutton should be well hung, and 
roasted very slowly; one of nine to ten lbs. will 
take quite three hours. A loin of mutton should be 
neatly jointed, a great part of the top and under 
fat taken off, and the flap rolled neatly under ; it 
will take about two hours to roast, or longer if 
large. Serve good clear brown gravy -round this 
joint, and red currant jelly handed. 

Rolled Loin of Mutton. 80. 

Cut all the meat neatly from the bones, put them 
into a saucepan with some vegetables, sweet herbs, 
pepper, salt, andTa good pint of water ; let them boil 
slowly for two hours. Trim your mutton neatly, 
leaving on very little fat. Chop up the kidney fine, 
taking out the skin ; mix it with about 10 button 
mushrooms also chopped, a dessert-spoonful of 
chopped parsley, a handful of bread crumbs, pepper, 
salt, and about a quarter of a grated nutmeg ; lay 
this mixture in the loin of muttou, and roll it up 
from the thick end. Put it into a moderate oven 
for an hour ; baste it well to prevent it drying at 
all. Strain your broth from the bones, remove all 
fat, put the mutton into it, cover the pan close, and 
let it simmer very gently lor one Ivowy a.nd a half. 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 37 

Put it on to a very hot dish, and keep it warm. 
Thicken the gravy with some comflonr, add a glass 
of port wine, more pepper and salt if required, and 
a dessert-spoonful of mushroom ketchup. Give this 
a good boil up over the fire, pour over the mutton, 
and serve very hot. Button mushrooms may be put 
into the gravy. 

Boned Shoulder op Mutton. 81. 

Bone a lean shoulder of mutton, it should be a 
small, and not a fat one for this purpose ; cut off 
the knuckle end, and any loose bits of skin. Take 
some fresh or tinned oysters, strain the liquor from 
them, and beard them, rinse them again well in the 
liquor. Lay your mutton on the table on the skin 
side, sprinkle it over well with a mixture of salt, 
pepper, and mace; then lay in your oysters, roll, 
and bind round with tape. Take 2 oz. of butter, 
put it into a saucepan that will hold the mutton, 
melt it, theii add a few slices of onion, some pepper- 
corns, and a sprig of parsley; let these brown a 
little, put in the mutton, add as much stock as will 
be about an inch, or rather more, deep in the pan ; 
cover down, and let it simmer gently for two to 
three hours, or till quite tender ; strain the gravy, 
thicken it a little, add to it a little ketchup, warm 
well, and pour round the mutton. 

Saddle, or Loin, of Mutton R^chaufp^. 82. 

If the loin is used for this, it must not be jointed, 
and must be carved like the saddle. Cut off, when 
cold, all the meat from the bone side, leaving the 
fat and flat side as before. Mince the meat very 
fine, adding more mutton from any cold joint you 
have. Put the mince into a stewpan, with a little 
very finely chopped onion, salt, and pepper, a little 
good gravy, enough to moisten it, and ^\\fiik<ei \tl ^

mixed ; then fill up the space in yonr loin or saddle 
of mutton with this, so that it looks like a fresh 
joint again ; cover well with bread crumbs, put bits 
of butter over, brown well in the oven, and serve 
very hot with good gravy round. The onion put to 
this is best cooked first. 

C6TELETTES 1 LA SaNT^. 83. 

Take the best end of a neck of mutton, boil very 
gently with half an onion and a carrot in the sauce- 
pan. Allow it to get cold, cut and trim into cutlets, 
taking off nearly all the fat. Mix together a little 
finely-chopped parsley, onion, salt, and pepper; 
beat the yolk of an egg and mix with it. Put your 
cutlets into a little good thick gravy for a few 
minutes over the fire, then dip each, first into fine 
bread crumbs, then into the egg and chopped 
parsley, and again into bread crumbs. Fry lightly. 
Serve with a rich brown sauce. 

Mutton Cutlets 1 la Ri^forme. 84. 

Take 1 oz. of butter, warm in a saucepan, shake 
in 1 oz. of flour, stir well, then add ^ a pint of good 
stock and a bunch of sweet herbs. Boil for a 
quarter of an hour. Cut up the best end of a tender 
neck of mutton into nice cutlets, taking off fat and 
skin. Mince some ham, about 2 or 3 table-spoon- 
fuls, 2 eggs boiled hard, a small bit of boiled onion, 
add salt and pepper. Egg the cutlets very well, 
then dip them into the mixture, and fry a nice 
brown. Sei've in a round, peas or spinach in the 
centre. In frying cutlets, it is best to put them into 
a frying-pan, with your lard or dripping rubbed

C6TELETTES IN FORCEMEAT. 85. 

Take the cutlets, neatly cut, from the neck of 
mutton. Stew them very gently in some broth (add 
a bunch of sweet herbs and very little salt) for about 
an hour, for they must do very slowly. Take out 
the cutlets, take the fat ofE the broth, strain it, and 
return to the pan, and boil it till it comes to a glaze. 
Glaze the cutlets, and let them cool. Take a little 
cold veal, 2 hard-boiled eggs, a bit of beef suet, or 
butter if preferred, some parsley, onion, and mush- 
rooms, add cayenne and salt. Mince all very fine 
together, and mix into a paste with a little cream ; 
roll each cutlet into this forcemeat, egg, and cover 
with bread crumbs ; fry, or put them on a tin in 
the oven until they are nicely browned. Serve with 
mushrooms in the gravy. These are good cold for 
luncheon. Mutton cutlets may also be served egged 
and bread-crumbed, and fried plain, with vegetables 
of any kind in the centre. 

Norman Hash. 86. 

Take 2 oz. of butter, warm it, add by degrees 1| 
oz. of flour, half an onion, a sprig of herbs, and a 
good pint of stock. Boil well, and strain; slice 
mutton very thin and free from skin ; put the meat 
into the sauce, stew very gently for thi^ee-quarters 
of an hour, take out the herbs. Add half a glass of 
sherry before serving. Beef can also be used for 
this hash, but will require rather longer to stew. 
Cooked meat is best for this. 

Indian Hash. 87. 

Take some thin slices of cold mutton or beef, 
free from skin or fat ; put them into a stewpan with 
some good stock ; season with salt, pepper, a little 
mace, and add a bit of butter, also a allG^ Cil Y'ecv'crcL

the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, rub smooth in a 
small basin, add to them a large teaspoonful of 
made mustard ; take some of the gravy from the 
pan, put it to the above until it is a thin paste; 
pour this back into the pan, take out the lemon, let 
all simmer together for about five minutes. Serve 
hot. 

Hash Piquantb. 88. 

Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, peel and slice 
2 onions, fry in the butter till well browned. Add 
half a pint of good stock, 1 dessert-spoonful of 
Worcester sauce, 2 of tarragon yinegar, 1 table- 
spoonful of curry paste or powder, a small lump of 
sugar, pepper and salt to taste. Let this sauce 
come to the boil, then simmer for half an hour, 
stirring now and again; thicken it with 1 table- 
spoonful of flour, mixed smooth in a very little cold 
gravy, or the same quantity of cornflour. Let the 
thickening boil well. Have ready about 1 lb. of 
cold mutton, cut in neat slices, and free from skin 
or fat ; put it into the sauce, heat it gently through, 
but do not boil, or it will be hard. Serve with 
sippets of toast round, or fried potatoes. 

Mutton Cabol. 89. 

Bone a loin of mutton, leaving all the long flap. 
Take ofE all the fat outside and in. Brush over with 
egg. Take 4 handfuls of bread-crumbs, mix with 
them the grated rind of 2 lemons, pepper, salt, a 
little nutmeg, parsley, thyme, and onion, all chopped 
very small. Put this thickly inside the loin (it 
may be mixed with a little cream if liked) ; roll the 
loin up and skewer tight ; roast gently, and baste 
it well. Serve with good brown gravy, into which 
put a glass of port wine and a large teaspoonful of 
2'ed currant jelly.

To Stew Mutton Cutlets Plain. 90. 

These can be taken from either a loin or neck of 
mntton, free them from skin and fat. Frjr slightly 
either plain, or cover with egg and bread-crumbs. 
Have a good cold gravy ready, put in your cutlets ; 
cover your pan, and let them stew gently for an 
honr. Thicken the gravy a little, and add a few 
button mushrooms if liked. 

Minced Mutton and Cucumber. 91. 

Pare and core a cucumber; cut it into pieces 
about 1^ inch long, put the pieces into a stewpan, 
with a small bit of butter, pepper, and salt ; let it 
brown a very little, then shake in a small half tea- 
spoonful of flour, and 2 or 3 table-spoonfuls of 
gravy, let it simmer very gently by the side of the 
fire. Cut some cold mutton, free from skin or fat, 
pass it through the mincing machine until quite 
fine. Mix it with pepper, salt, a little gravy, and 
enough cream and butter to make it about as thick 
as a good batter. Put it on the fire in a pan, and 
stir frequently until quite hot. Put the mutton on 
to a dish, making it stand rather high, make a 
small hole in the centre, into which put the stewed 
cucumber. In all these recipes, a little browning, 
made as g^ven in Becipe "No. 278, can be added, 
where a darker colour is required, either for gravy 
or in a mince. 

Minced Mutton and Eggs. 92. 

Put your mutton, free from sinew or fat, through 
the mincing machine. Mix it with pepper, salt, a 
bit of butter, and a little nicely flavoured stock ; 
put it on the fire in a pan to warm well, but not to 
boil. Have some very hot well-mashed potatoes

Mutton Curried (A Simple Recipe). 93. 

Cut 1 lb. of tender cold mutton in small square 
pieces. Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, make it 
boiling hot, add about 2 oz. of onion finely minced, 
brown this slightly, then add 1 oz. of curry powder, 
and 1 saltspoonful of salt, stir over the fire until 
the curry powder is well mixed in ; then put in the 
mutton, and enough broth or stock to keep it all 
soft, but it must not be liquid. Let it stew gently 
for ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Serve 
piled high on a dish, with boiled rice round. 

Rolled Loin oy Veal. 94. 

Have the kidney end of the loin of veal cut long 
into the flap ; veal for this dish should not be too 
large. Take about 6 or 8 lbs. ; bone it carefully ; 
line the inside with some slices of cooked ham, 2 
hard-boiled eggs cut into slices. The veal kidney 
must be chopped fine, and free from skin, and mixed 
with about 2 handfuls of fine bread crumbs, a little 
parsley and thyme chopped fine, the grated rind of 
a lemon, pepper, salt, and a little mace. Bind 
together with an egg, and lay it on the veal, over 
the ham and eggs. Roll up and skewer well, put 
it into a moderate oven for an hour or more, with 
plenty of fat or dripping over it to prevent its dry- 
ing. Have some good stock highly flavoured ; put 
it into a stewpan with the veal, it need not cover it ; 
about 2 inches deep in the pan will be enough ; 
cover the pan, and let the veal stew gently from 
two to three houi's. Serve with a rich gravy. This

good stock. 

Feicandeau of Veal. 95. 

Have either the middle of the loin or the best 
end of the neck of veal, about 4 lbs. Cut the meat 
off the bones in one neat piece. Trim off the skin 
and fat, and lard it thickly with bacon. Put the 
veal into a stewpan, with the bones and trimmings 
round it ; add a sliced onion, small carrot, mush- 
room, or celery (according to season of the year), 
half a lettuce, 2 cloves, a small blade of mace, and 
a bit of allspice, a saltspoonful of salt, half one of 
pepper, a teaspoonf ul of moist sugar, and nearly a 
pint of. water. Cover the top of the veal with 
writing-paper thickly spread with butter, this must 
be above the water. Simmer as gently as possible 
for three hours, take off the paper, baste the veal 
well with the broth, and simmer half an hour 
longer. Take out the veal, keep it hot, skim all 
the fat off the gravy, strain, and rub the vegetables 
through a hair sieve; add a table-spoonful of 
French brandy, or a small glass of sherry ; give the 
whole a warm, and serve over the veal. Cold frican- 
deau makes an excellent mayonnaise. 

Roast Fillet of Veal. 96. 

Have this carefully boned; if not wanted too 
large, a piece may be cut out, without cutting the 
skin, and used ^for cutlets, or any other purpose. 
Get ready a nice stuffing, and after washing and 
wiping your meat, stuff it well, roll the skin tight

This should be very small and tender veal. Stuff 
it with an oyster stufl&ng (Recipe No. 535). Bind 
neatly and tight with tape; cover well with cold 
water, and let it come slowly to the boil ; skim very 
carefully, then simmer for three hours or more. 
Skewer firmly, take ofE the tape carefully. Serve 
with oyster sauce (Recipe No. 248). 

Knuckle op Veal. 98. 

This is rather a rough dish, and will require to 
boil a long time. One weighing 6 lbs. must boil 
over two hours. It should be well skimmed, and 
not allowed to cook too fast. Served with chopped 
parsley and butter. Most of the other joints of veal 
will roast. A shoulder and breast may be boned, 
stuffed, and rolled, and then stewed or roasted. 

Veal 1 la Paysanne. 99. 

Take the remains of a cold roasted loin or neck 
of veal, cut off some neat round pieces without bone 
or skin, season them with salt, pepper, and cayenne ; 
have some good brown sauce ready, put in your 
meat, and let it simmer gently for half an hour ; 
before serving, add the juice of half a lemon. 
Arrange neatly on a dish, with tomatoes or kidney 
beans in the centre. 

Galantine op Veal. 100. 

This may be made of either the loin or breast ; if

roll tight, and tie ; or put it into a clean slightly 
floured cloth. Put all the trimmings, veal bones, 
etc., into a saucepan big enough to hold the meat, 
add a calf's foot washed and cut in pieces, 1 onion, 
2 carrots, a bundle of sweet herbs, a bay leaf, 2 
cloves, pepper, salt, and 1 bit of mace ; pour on this 
about a pint and a half of cold water, let it come 
to the boil, then draw it back, and when it has 
cooled a little put in your galantine. Boil gently 
for two to two and a half hours. Take out the 
meat, take off the cloth, and serve with a good 
oyster or rich white sauce over it ; have ready the 
grated yolk of a hard-boiled egg, sprinkle this on 
the veal, not on the sauce which is round. This is 
also good cold. When you take off the cloth, put 
the galantine between two flat dishes, with a weight 
on the top one. Glaze the veal when quite cold, 
and serve with savoury jelly made from Recipe 
No. 642. 

Veal Cutlets. 101. 

Cut from any nice lean piece of veal about a 
dozen cutlets ; a piece cut out of the fillet, or the 
best end of the neck, or the under piece of the loin 
will answer ; they must be neatly trimmed, and as 
near the same shape and size as possible, beat them 
a little with the i*olling pin; after beating they 
should be very little over a quai-ter of an inch thick ; 
next beat up some eggs, and have some fine dry 
bread crumbs ; mix a little pepper and salt into the 
bread crumbs. Dip each cutlet first into the egg, 
then into the bread crumbs until they are quite 
covered. Have the frying-pan ready, V\l\i ^oma ^^^

served in a crown, vegetables of any kind can be 
put in the centre, and gravy round. 

Stewed Veal Cutlets. 102. 

Prepare as above, fry very slightly, then stew in 
good gravy for three-quarters of an hour or more. 
These are good taken out of the gravy they are 
stewed in, and served with tomato sauce or con- 
serve, which should be made very hot. Tomato 
conserve can be bought at the stores. 

Grendines of Veal. 103. 

Cut some neat slices of cold veal, about half an 
inch thick. Lard them with fat bacon on one 
side, lay them on a flat tin, having the larded side 
up ; put in some Hch stock, but do not cover the 
meat. The tin must be covered, and put into a 
moderate oven for an hour. Take ofE the cover, 
baste the meat with the gravy, and leave in the oven 
till the bacon is brown. Serve with the gravy 
round. 

French Minced Veal. 104. 

Take some of the white meat, mince very fine. 
Fry a shallot chopped small in a little butter ; when 
straw-colour add a bit of flour and a little stock, 
then put in the mince, also a little chopped parsley, 
pepper, and salt. Mix well, add more stock if 
necessary, but it should not be too soft, make it very 
hot, but not to boil. Beat up the yolk of an egg 
and the juice of a lemon together, take the mince 
ofE the fire, stir in the egg and lemon. Have ready

dish you are going to dish your veal on, make these 
pieces of toast stand in a wall all i*ound the dish

warm), put the veal in the centre, and serve. Plain 
minced veal may be made with only a little cream, 
2 table-spoonfuls of light stock, pepper, and salt, 
stirred together over the fii*e. It should be thick 
enough just to stand on the dish of itself. 

Boiled Leg of Lamb. 105. 

This is very good with green gooseberry sauce. 
It should be washed, then put into a pan, and cold 
water poured on to cover it well . Let it come slowly

f uls of salt ; when the water is quite clear, put in a 
little parsley and mint, and let it boil very slowly 
for two hours, or rather more if large. Serve,

Roast Hind and Fore Quarter of Lamb. lOG. 

These, like all the other joints of lamb, should be 
well basted while roasting, but not done too quickly. 
Li the fore quarter the shoulder should be sepai*ated 
from the ribs with a sharp knife after roasting. A 
small slice of fresh butter, a bit of cayenne, and a 
squeeze of lemon should be laid under the shoulder, 
which should be replaced. Serve good mint sauce, 
with plenty of finely chopped mint in it, with all 
roast and cold lamb. These joints will take from 
two and a half to thi*ee houi's to i*oast. Lamb should 
always be well cooked through.

saucepan, shake it round, but only leave in about 2 
tablespoonfuls, arrange the cutlets in a flat layer, 
and keep them near a gentle fire, simmer as gently 
as possible, but without stopping, for about an hour 
or rather longer. Mutton may be done the same 
way, and is very good for invalids if it is carefully 
cooked ; but this recipe will be quite spoilt if the 
meat is not cooked very slowly. A little more water 
or gravy may be added, but if the meat is carefully 
cooked it should not be required. The chops must 
be turned when half done. Lamb cutlets may also 
be dressed in the same way as the recipes given for 
mutton cutlets in Nos. 84, 85, and 90. 

Fillet of Mutton. 108. 

In my recipes for mutton, I forgot to mention that 
for a small family a leg will make two nice joints. 
Divide it above the knuckle joint, bone the fillet or 
upper end, stufE it, tie up tight, and roast it. 

Knuckle of Mutton. 109. 

Take the other end of the leg, cut off the leg bone 
to near the meat. Have ready a saucepan big 
enough to hold the mutton, put in 1 oz. of butter 
and a small onion sliced, let this brown, then put in 
the mutton and a pinj of hot water or common stock, 
wash and clean well \ a teacupf ul of pearl barley, 
add it to the meat, only it is best got ready sooner 
and soaked for an hour first ; peel 2 carrots and cut 
into neat pieces, 2 small turnips, a stick of celery, 
salt and pepper ; stew all gently for two hours or 
more, serve with the vegetables and some of the 
barley in the gravy round. The gravy can be 
darkened with a little browning. More onion can 
be used if liked. 

To Roast a Leg of Pork. 110. 
Get a small, tender leg of pork, not very fat, and 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 49 

not more than about 6 lbs. in weight. Take ont all 
the bone, leaving only the piece from the leg to the 
first joint. A sharp knife will be required for this, 
and the meat cut carefully all round the bone, which 
must be pulled well forward, so as to get the knife 
down to loosen it at the joint. Fill up all the part 
where the bone was with a good stuffing (a little 
sage can be mixed with the stuffing if liked) ; cut 
the skin through in narrow lines aci*oss the leg, and 
put it down to roast, but not too near the fire at 
first, and baste constantly. It will take 3 hours to 
roast. Serve with brown gravy and apple sauce. 
This is an old-fashioned dish, but a good family one, 
if the pork is tender and well cooked. The stuffing 
should be made with bread-crumbs, parsley chopped, 
salt, pepper, a small bit of onion chopped and boiled 
first ; bind together with egg. 

Pork Chops. 111. 

Cut from a tender loin some chops free of skin 
and fat, a little more than a quarter of an inch thick ; 
egg and bread-crumb them, or fry plain, but they 
must be cooked very slowly at first or they will be 
hard ; put them in the frying-pan with the dripping 
cold, and let them warm gradually, turn when nicely 
brown on one side. Serve with a little dark thick 
gravy round and some apple sauce in the centre of 
the dish. 

To Bake a Sucking Pig. 112. 

Some prefer this roasted, but it gives much more 
trouble, requiring great care, whereas, if baked in 
a moderate oven, it is really quite as good. If 
stuffing is liked, mix about half a pint of bread 
crumbs, 3 teaspoonfuls of chopped sage or parsley, 
3 oz. of butter, a large saltspoon of salt, and a good 
half saltspoon of pepper. Put this into tlv^ ^^^^^^-^

put it in the dish in which it is to be baked, cover- 
ing every part thickly over with white of egg which 
has been beaten a little. It will require no basting. 
When it is done, lay it on a very hot dish, cut off 
the head, and split the body down the back. The 
stuffing can be mixed with the brains ; put it into 
half a pint of good veal gravy, add a glass of 
madeira or sherry, pour it on the dish with the pig, 
or put it into a sauce-tureen to be handed. Bread 
sauce should also be served with it ; a pig about three 
weeks old will take about one hour and three quar- 
ters to cook. 



POULTRY, GAME, Etc. 



Choose poultry which is young and plump. The 
skin should be clear and white, the breasts broad 
and full, the toes pliable and easily broken when 
bent back. The feet of geese and ducks should be 
yellow and flexible ; when the feet are hard and red, 
the skin full of hairs, and the bills red, they are 
old birds. For boiling, pick out chickens with white 
legs if possible. Poultry should be well hung, but 
never allowed to become the least tainted. Pigeons 
are better flavoured if used fresh. In cold weather 
a turkey will hang in its feathers for ten days or a 
fortnight. Care should be taken with all poultry, 
that in drawing it the gall bladder should not be 
broken and allowed to go over the meat. Also it 
should be very well singed with paper, and all black 
bits left from the feathers pulled out ; wash the in- 
side well with plenty of water ; let cold water run 
through the inside, but wipe it quite dry after with a 
clean cloth. Game, from venison to the smallest bird, 
is all the better for being well hung in a cool dry 
place. Plenty of pepper can be sprinkled on them, to 
keep ofE the fly as much as possible. You will soon 
perceive if a bird is becoming tainted by the smell 
when you open the beak. Game should be carefully 
plucked and drawn, wiped with a dry cloth outside, 
and washed or wiped with a damp cloth inside. 
Hares require to be washed well in both cold and 
warm water, vinegar may also be used, then c^\^- 
fully wipe dry.

Roast Turkey or Fowl. 113. 

After singeing it well, wipe it carefully outside, 
pour water through the inside, then dry carefully 
with a clean cloth. Fill the breast with good force- 
meat, or with sausage-meat highly seasoned with 
minced herbs, lemon-rind, and cayenne. Truss the 
turkey very firmly ; baste it very well while it is 
cooking, to prevent its being dry; a piece of buttered 
writing-paper can be put over the breast at first, 
but taken ofE in time to brown it. Serve bread 
sauce with it. A small turkey will take one and a 
half to two hours ; longer if it is larger. Poultry 
should always be well done, but not dried up. Flour 
should be shaken over both turkeys and fowls before 
roasting. Fowls may be roasted and trussed the 
same way. A fowl will take an hour to roast, quite 
young chickens about thirty-five minutes; care must 
be taken not to do any poultry too fast at first. 

Boiled Turkey or Fowl. 114. 

Wash very clean after singeing, and wipe very dry. 
Cut the skin at the first joint of the legs and draw 
them off. This can be done by fastening the leg in 
a door, or on a hook, and then pulling the bird from 
it. In trussing a turkey or fowl for boiling, the 
legs must be drawn into the body, and the breast 
bone broken to make it look plump. Stuff the 
breast well ; oyster forcemeat is good for stuffing a 
turkey. Boil in plenty of warm water very gently, 
and take all the scum very carefully off the water. 
It will take nearly two hours, if a moderate size. 
A fowl will take over an hour, a small chicken about 
three-quarters of an hour.

breaking it until you can cut the joints of the wings 
and legs; then proceed carefully with the other 
part, leaying the merrythought until the breast is 
cut off the bone. If wanted to be large, and neai'ly 
the proper shape, it is best to bone a turkey first, 
then a fowl, then a pigeon or partridge ; put one 
inside the other, and fill up with forcemeat ; or a 
turkey may be stuffed with tongue and filled in 
with forcemeat ; it must then be sewn up. A more 
simple way is to draw the legs and wings into the 
body, lay the bird flat on the table, cover it thickly 
with forcemeat, pieces of tongue, ham, and moi*e 
forcemeat, roll tightly, and bind with tape. It 
should then be put into a clean stew-pan, covered 
with good veal broth, and allowed to stew veiy 
gently for an hour to an hour and a half. Some 
cooks put it into a thin pudding-cloth before stew- 
ing it. After it is done, press it slightly with a 
light weight between two Wishes until cold, then 
glaze lightly, and serve with savoury jelly. Or it 
can be served hot, with a good white sauce. A good 
stock can be made to stew it in from the bones of 
the bird, a bunch of sweet herbs, a calf's foot, 
cleaned and cut up, 2 carrots, 2 bay leaves, a blade 
of mace, 2 doz. peppercorns, and any trimmings of 
any white meat; add salt and 3| pints of water. 
The bird can be stewed in this for an hour and a 
half, then taken out and pressed. The stock must 
then be boiled till it will jelly, strained, and left to 
get cold. Carefully take off all the fat, and break 
it up to put round the turkey.

Truss it carefully to prevent the stuffing coming 
out ; roast, and baste frequently. Serve with gravy 
and apple or tomato sauce. It will take about one 
hour and three-quarters. It may be stuffed with 
mashed potatoes, if liked, but they must be mashed 
very dry, mixed with pepper, salt, and 2 oz. of 
butter ; a little chopped onion can be added if liked. 

Guinea Fowl, Roasted. 117. 

These birds should hang as long as they will be- 
fore being cooked. Then they should be stuffed like 
a turkey and served with gravy and bread sauce, or 
with a piquante sauce. They will take about an 
hour to roast. 

Boiled Fowls. 118. 

Take 1 quart of boiling water and 1 quart of cold 
water ; clean and truss your fowl carefully ; the 
legs should be drawn, cutting the skin at the first 
joint, and then put under the skin into the bodies, 
while the wings should be cut off short and twisted 
back ; no livers or gizzards should be trussed with 
boiled fowl. Put them into water, mixed as above, 
that will be about right heat, but it must entirely 
cover them ; skim well when it comes to the boil, 
then simmer, for a fowl, an hour, for chickens, about 
half the time. Serve with celery or oyster sauce, 
or even with plain white sauce to which the yolk of 
an egg has been added. You must have sauce 
enough to entirely cover your fowl, or chickens, and 
to cover the flat part of the dish also. It must be 
quite smooth and not too thick ; it quite spoils the 
look of your dish if the fowl appears only half- 
covered with lumpy wliite Bovxce.

Broiled Chioken. 119. 

This should first be boiled for about ten minutes ; 
allow it to become cold, then split into two, wash 
over with beaten egg, then cover with bread 
crumbs ; broil it over a clear ^re ; it will take half 
an honr, or if large, longer. Serve veiy hot. The 
legs should be trussed like a boiled fowl, and it 
should be made as flat as possible. The inside 
should be put first on the grid. 

Roast Ducks. 120. 

Be careful to see that they are properly picked 
free from the stumps left from the feathers. Take 
off the head, neck, and pinions of the wings from 
the first joint from the body ; keep these, also the 
heart, liver, and gizzai*d ; carefully wash the inside 
of the ducks well, pouring water through them ; 
wipe the outside with a dry cloth. Put in a stuff- 
ing, the same as for a goose, of bread crumbs, boiled 
onions, etc., but no sage, without it is liked ; a little 
parsley may be used instead. The feet are generally 
left on, and trussed under the back, being first held 
in boiling water for a few minutes to make the skin 
loose, which must be pulled off. Boast and baste 
well ; they will take about an hour ; quite young 
ones only half that time. Serve with good brown 
gi'avy. 

Stewed Giblets. 121. 

Take all the giblets from a goose or couple of 
ducks — ^neck, wing pinions, heart, liver, gizzard ; 
clean very carefully, cut the neck and gizzard into 
neat pieces, put them into a stewpan with a bunch 
of sweet herbs, a bit of parsley, part of an onion 
with three cloves stuck in it, 6 peppercorns, salt, 
and about a pint of water ; bring it slowly to the 
boil, then simmer gently for an l\o\w\ ot \?!J\ ^^^

the sauce, add a little browning to it, some mnsh- 
room ketchup, and more pepper and salt, if neces- 
sary. Put the giblets in again, warm, and serve ; or 
put them on one side, and make them into a pie. 

Pigeons. 122. 

These are good roasted or stewed ; if roasted, 
they should be used fresh and well basted, the heads 
and necks cut ofP, and trussed like a duck ; pour 
plenty of water through them before trussing, and 
wipe dry ; but wipe the outside only with a dry 
cloth. Put into the inside of each a little butter 
and a bit of cayenne. They will take about twenty- 
five minutes, but if very young not so long. 

To Stew Wood-Pigeons. 123. 

These eat very well if hung for a little to make 
them more tender; after cleaning and trussing, bake 
them in a moderate oven for half an hour, basting 
them well ; have ready some good stock, warm it, 
and put in the pigeons before they are cold; let 
them simmer in this very gently for nearly an hour, 
take some of the stock, thicken and darken it, add 
some cayenne, and a dessert-spoonful of port wine ; 
dish the pigeons, and pour the gravy round. 

To Roast Venison. 124. 

Take great care the meat is well hung. Take the 
skin from the top part, put butter and salt over the 
fat ; then make a paste of flour and water, lay it 
on and fasten it by four or five sheets of paper, 
sewn together and skewered on firmly. Boast it 
gently and baste it. About twenty minutes before 
it is done, take off the paper and paste, and let it 
colour gradually to a pale brown, but be most care- 
ful it does not bum. Serve with a good gravy 
round and with red currant jelly. A little port 
wine can be added to the gravy. 



menu cookery book. 57 

Hashed Venison. 125. 
Take a pint of very good brown gravy, mix with 
it some of the Sauce Tartare (Recipe No. 253). Cut 
the venison in small thin slices of equal size, pnt 
them into a saucepan, cover with the sauce, and let 
it stand from fifteen to twenty minutes ; put the 
pan on the fire, let it get gradually warm till it 
gets hot quite through ; it must on no account boil, 
but it must be veiy hot when sent to table. 

Hare, Roasted. 126. 

A hare will hang some time in winter, if kept in 
a dry place ; damp does it more harm than anything, 
and gives it a musty smell and flavour. It is better 
not touched, except putting a little pepper over the 
head, until it is required for cooking; if drawn 
first, and then hung, the inside gets very musty, 
and is apt to make it taste when cooked. This 
applies also to rabbits ; both may be wiped with 
vinegar after having been skinned, cleaned, and 
well washed, first in cold, then in warm water. If 
a hare is very high, it may be left in tepid water 
for some little time ; or if the blood has settled in 
one part, and it looks black, just cut it with the 
point of a knife, and soak it in warm water to draw 
out the dark blood. Wipe it very dry, fill with 
good forcemeat, sew up and truss firmly. Roast it 
carefully, or the outside will become dry and hard 
before it is done ; a thin piece of skin from beef 
suet is good to fasten over the middle of the back 
for the fiiTst three-quarters of an hour while it 
roasts, then taken off. A hare must be basted well 
with good beef dripping or butter ; or the butter can 
be used only just at the last ; flour the hare when 
first put to the fire. Serve with good gravy round, 
and red currant jelly to hand with it. A hare should 
be allowed about an hour and three-c^jaax^t^ iss^ 
roasting'.

Roast Rabbit. 127. 

Rabbits can be cooked mucli the same as hares, 
but they will take hardly an hour to roast. If liked, 
the backbone can be taken out ; it must be carefully 
done, so as not to break the skin. A rabbit done 
this way will require much more stuffing put into 
it ;* a little thin bacon, or slices of ham, may be put 
in before the stuffing. 'Flour and baste well ; the 
flour should only be put on at first. Almost all 
game, poultry, and meat is improved by being 
floured a little at first. Red currant jelly is sent in 
also with roast rabbit. 

Boiled Rabbits. 128. 

Select very young ones for boiling; wash and 
clean well. Fasten the head to the side ; have water 
boiling and skimmed ready, put in the rabbits, and 
simmer gently for half to three-quarters of an hour. 
Serve with plenty of white or onion sauce over 
them. 

To Roast Pheasants and Partridges. 129. 

These birds both require to hang as long as they 
will before being cooked. Pluck carefully, not to 
break the skin, make a small split in the back of 
the neck to take out crop ; draw, and clean well, 
wiping the inside with a damp cloth, or, if necessaiy, 
pour water through the birds. Truss tight, flour at 
first, and baste with butter and good dripping ; a 
pheasant will take three-quaiiers of an hour; a 
partridge, half an hour or less. Serve both with 
good brown gi*avy. Bread sauce, and bread crumbs 
nicely browned, to be handed with them. 

To Roast Snipe and Woodcock. 130. 

Pluck these birds carefully, as the skin soon 
breaks, wipe them with, a cVeau c\.o>i\i, \s\x\» ^<^"Wt 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 59 

draw them, truss with the head nnder the wing ; 
fionr well and baste with butter. The trail will 
begin to drop as soon as the birds get warm ; put a 
piece of nicely buttered toast under to catch it ; the 
toast must not be too thin, and free from crust. 
The birds will take about twenty minutes, take the 
toast, put it on a very hot dish, serve the birds on 
it, with gravy round. Snipe are cooked the same 
way, only they don't take quite so long to roast. 

To Roast Grouse. 131. 

These birds are some of the best game eaten, if 
properly hung and well roasted. Wipe very clean 
inside with a damp cloth, but do not wash without 
it is necessary. They will take from thii-ty to 
thirty-five minutes. 

Wild Duck. 132. 

Prepare them in the same way as ducks, only do 
not stuff them ; flour well and put them near a good 
fire. Some people prefer them underdone, in which 
case twenty minutes will be long enough, but five 
or ten minutes more will not spoil them. Baste 
with butter or good dripping. Sei've with brown 
gravy round ; also lemon, cut in quarters, and cay- 
enne should be handed with them. 



Larks. 132a. 

Take 10 or 12 larks, skin, draw, and wash them 
inside ; put a bit of butter and pepper inside each, 
truss them with a little thread, and run a thin 
skewer through them. A good many can be put on 
to each skewer ; roast gently for about ten minutes. 
Serve on toast with cleai' brown gravy. B^^^)^ ^SJOcv

it, a bit of allspice, a few peppercorns, and a bit of 
lemon peel. Simmer gently for three-quarters of an 
hour, strain and thicken the gravy, and serve over 
the hash. 

Veal Olives. 164. 

Cut some thin slices fi'om a cold fillet of veal, 
from three to four inches long and about two wide ; 
cut some bacon the same size. Half boil some 
shallot or onion, mince very fine with a little sweet 
herb almost to a powder, add salt and pepper. 
Take as many Spanish olives as you have pieces of 
veal, peel them quite thin round and i»ound, but do 
not break it in peeling ; take out the stone, and the 
peel will curl up again. Put a piece of veal and 
bacon together, sprinkle on some of the herb 
mixture, put an olive into each, tie with thread and 
fry them in hot lard or butter a light brown ; take 
them out and put them on one side. Now fry a 
little sliced onion in the butter, add a little flour, 
sweet herbs, bits of mushroom, pepper, salt, and 
some good stock; let it boil fifteen to twenty 
minutes, strain it and lay in the veal olives, having 
first taken the thread carefully ofE them. Simmer 
for half an hour. The gravy should cover them 
while they are cooking. Serve in the sauce. 

Bacon Kromeskys. 165.

gravy so that it is not too dry. Cut some thin 
slices of bacon about three inches long, put on each 
piece some of the mixture, roll up neatly and put in 
a cool place. Take the yolks of 2 eggs, stir into 
them carefully half a table-spoonful of olive oil, 
adding 4 table-spoonfuls of cold water by degrees 
as it thickens, and 1 table-spoonful of brandy ; next 
mix in by degrees 2| table-spoonfuls of fine flom' 
and a good pinch of salt. If the batter is too thick, 
add a little more water. Stir in quickly, just before 
using, the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a froth. Dip 
each piece of the rolled bacon into the batter, and 
fry immediately in boiling lard. 

TiMBALE OF Rabbit. 166. 

Take any pieces left from cold boiled rabbits, cut 
all the meat off the bones, mince and pound in a 
mortar with a bit of butter, some chopped parsley 
and sweet herbs, a little good gravy, pepper and 
salt ; mix well, then add a few bread crumbs and 1 
or 2 eggs, according to the amount of meat you 
have. Take some timbales or small cups, butter 
and flour them, put in the mixture, and steam 
three-quarters of an hour. Turn out and serve with 
white sauce. A little lean ham or tongue, minced 
with the rabbit, will improve the flavour. 

Stewed Rabbit or Hare. 167. 

Cut up into neat joints. Take a large flat stew- 
pan, make it hot, put into it a lump of lard about 
the size of a large walnut ; put in the joints of hare 
so that each piece touches the bottom of the pan, 
add a little sliced onion, and sprinkle over them by 
degrees a large handful of flour, brown both sides. 
Then pour over it a pint of boiling water, or weak 
stock, season with salt, pepper, and 2 or 3 cloves, a 
bit of allspice, a bunch oi parsley, «jid 2 bay leaves. 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 73 

Simmer slowly 1^ honrs, then add a tumbler of 
claret, and simmer again for 1 hour. It must not 
be allowed to do fast, or it will dry up too much. 

Rabbit with Tomato Sauce. 168. 

Cut a rabbit in pieces, fry a light brown slowly 
(it is best done in a stewpan) in a little butter or 
lard, add pepper, salt, and a little sliced onion. 
Pour on to it some tomato sauce, a few spoonfuls 
of gravy, and stew for half to three-quarters of an 
hour. Babbits that have been i*oasted and ai*e 
rather underdone can be cooked this way after. 

Perdrix au Vin. 169. 

Boast 2 partridges. Put into a stewpan 3 table- 
spoonfuls of rich gravy, a glass of claret, salt, pep- 
per, the juice of a lemon, and a little cayenne. Cut 
np the birds, keeping them very hot. Make the 
sauce very hot over the fire, and pour over the 
partridges. 

Shrimp Puffs. 170. 

Pick a pint of shrimps, mince them rather small ; 
Tini-g with them some butter, anchovy paste, cayenne, 
a little cream, and white roux. Make a paste of 
flour, a small bit of butter, and mix with very little 
cold water, roll out very thin, cut it into neat square 
pieces about two inches one way and three the 
other. Put some of the shrimp mixture on each, 
fold over, wet the edges, press well together, wash 
over with yolk of egg ; fry in boiling lard a pale 
brown, serve high on cut paper. 

Bissoles. 171. 

These may be made of almost any cold meat ; the 
chief thing is, first to see thaj your meat is v^ry 
well minced, and that it is quite free from any 
lumps of fat, skin, or gristle *, also t\i».\» \\» \^ ^^

seasoned. A mixture of meat and game will make 
a good rissole, or 3 parts veal or chicken to 1 part 
ham or tongue. Mince your meat very fine, season 
highly, mix in a few bread crumbs (about half a 
cupful to 2 of meat), add a little gravy or stock, so 
as to make it the consistency of sausage meat, and 
bind with the yolks of 1 or more eggs. They may 
be made round, oval, flat like a veal cutlet, or the 
shape of a mutton cutlet with a bit of fried potato 
stuck in at one end to resemble a bone. After they 
are shaped they must be brushed over with beaten 
egg or cream, and dipped into bread crumbs, then 
fried a nice brown in boiling lard or dripping. If 
the fat is not quite boiling, it will spoil a rissole at 
once, as it will soak into it and cause it to be soft 
and break. Served with gravy, or fried parsley, or 
in a crown, with vegetables in the centre. They 
should be drained on paper after frying, either 
before the fire or where they will keep hot. 

Chicken Rissoles. 172. 

Take the white meat of a cold fowl or rabbit, put 
with it a small piece of onion that has been boiled, 
a few bread crumbs, 2 or 3 table-spoonfuls of pale 
stock, a small lump of butter, pepper, salt, and a 
little pounded allspice. Pass this all together 
through the mincing machine two or three times, 
until it is all well blended together; mix into it 
some cream and the yolks of 1 or 2 eggs until it is 
like sausage meat. Form this into the shape of 
small pyramids, about two and a half inches high, 
made wider and flat at the bottom so that they will 
stand. Wash each well over with the yolk of an 
eggj and roll into very ^e bread crumbs, and fry a 
pale brown in boiling lard or butter. Serve with 
tomato or piquante sauce round. These ai'e also

Chicken X la Cr£me« 173. 

Mince 6 small mnshrooms, put them into a stew- 
pan with 2 oz. of butter, but do not let them brown, 
shake in a good teaspoonful of flour and mix smooth, 
a few drops of lemon juice, pepper and salt, and 
half a teacupful of cream ; simmer for a little, but 
only to get warm and well mixed. Then add the 
finely minced white meat oft a cold chicken, heat 
all well together, and serve with a few fi'ied egg 
balls round. 

Petits PAt^s. 174. 

Gut some cold chicken into small dice; make a 
white sauce with a little cornflour, bit of butter, 
cream, or milk; season well, and add the yolk of 
an egg. Stir it over the fire until it thickens, then 
put in the chicken, let it warm through, then put 
it on one side. Line some patty pans with pufF 
paste, rather thin ; put some of the chicken into 
each; sprinkle bread-crumbs over the top, put a 
little bit of butter on each, and bake. Serve hot. 
Some prefer to bake the paste first, and warm the 
mixture in it after. Meat, nicely mixed with 
seasoned gravy, may also be used for these instead 
of chicken. 

Chicken Caparta. 176. 

Take half a pint of light stock, thicken it to the 
consistency of a good white sauce. Add a little 
cream, salt, and pepper. Cut up the remains of 
cold chicken ; put all the white meat, either in 
slices or minced, into the sauce, and let it warm 
well through. Take the legs, put on them butter, 
pepper, salt, and made mustard ; bi*oil them over 
the fire. Put the white meat and sauce neatly on 
to a dish, and the broiled legs cai^efuUy over it.

Lobster Cutlets. 176. 

Take the meat from the shell of a lobster, pound 
it well in a mortar, sprinkle in a little mace, 
cayenne, and salt ; melt 2 oz. of butter, mix it in 
well, also 3 table-spoonfuls of bread crumbs, and an 
egg well beaten. Should it be too dry, add a little 
cream. Mix very thoroughly, then form into cut- 
lets ; dip each piece into the beaten yolk of an egg, 
then into bread crumbs, and fry a light brown in 
hot butter. A small bit of the small claws can be 
stuck into each cutlet. 

Fried Chicken Piquante. 177. 

Cut up the remains of cold chicken into neat 
joints, put them into a pie dish. Mix together 2 
table-spoonfuls of good salad oil, a table-spoonful of 
chopped parsley and onion, a little pepper and salt. 
Put this mixture on the chicken, and squeeze over 
all the juice of a lemon ; leave it for four or five 
hours, turning the pieces once or twice. When 
ready, shake flour well over each piece, and fry 
gently. Put them neatly on a dish, with sauce No.

cooked the same way. 

Rabbit X la Fran9Aise. 178. 

Take a young rabbit, put it, after it is well 
washed, into a stewpan, with a small bit of lean 
bacon, an onion stuck with 3 or 4 cloves, about 10 
peppercorns, a bunch of sweet herbs, a stick of 
celery, and a carrot ; cover with about a quart of 
cold water, or some thin stock if you have it. Put 
a lid on your pan, and let the whole stew together

stewpan ; thicken it with cornflour and milk, it should 
be as thick as good white sauce. Put in the pieces 
of rabbit and let them get quite hot ; a little ci»eam 
may be added. The best pieces of the rabbit must 
be used for this. 

Chicken and Mushrooms. 179. 

Take et^ual quantities of milk and water, about 
half a pint of each, mix with it 2 teaspoonfuls of 
essence of anchovies, an onion, pepper, and salt. 
Cut up a chicken and let it stew gently in it till 
tender. Strain the gravy, put to it a little butter 
rolled in flour to thicken it, a glass of port wine, 
and some mushrooms. Then again add the chicken, 
and warm all well together. 

Fricassee of Chicken. 180. 

Clean a young plump chicken well, put it into 
some good stock with an onion stuck with 3 cloves, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, parsley, pepper, and salt ; 
stew gently for an hour; let it get a little cold, 
then cut the best pai't of the chicken into nice

this. Put a buttered paper over the top, and steam 
for three-quarters of an hour. Serve with a rich 
brown gravy round. 

Oysters in Batter. 182. 

Take some oysters, beard them, strain the liquor, 
and put them to stand in it for ten minutes. Mix 
smoothly some batter, 2 table-spoonfuls of flour, 
add to it, stirring it quite smooth, a little milk and 
cream mixed together, beat up the yolk of an egg, 
and stir in with a little salt, beat the white to a 
froth, and add just before using; it must be as thick 
as very good cream. Take about a dessert-spoonful 
of the batter, put an oyster into the ceniie, and 
drop it into a frying-pan in which you have some 
boiling lard ; as they are done, put them on paper 
before the fire to drain. The amount of batter 
must be increased for a dish ; only the proportion 
required is given. If preferred, a French batter 
may be made with 3 table-spoonfuls of flour, a little 
salt, a few drops of oil or beer, and mix with tepid 
water very lightly, or it will get stringy, and not 
drop from the spoon as it should ; whisk the whites 
of 2 eggs to a froth and stir in, then dip each oyster 
in. This batter should be lighter than the other.

Oyster Patties. 184. 

Take some fresh, or tinned, oystei'S, beard them, 
and cut up into small pieces ; strain the liquor, and 
put the pieces back into it. Put into a saucepan 
about 2 oz. of butter, warm it, shaking in as much 
flour as it will take up, stirring well all the time, 
but do not allow it to brown. Next stir in 2 or 3 
table-spoonfuls of the liquor from the oysters, and 
add as much thin cream, or good milk, as will make 
it the consistency of good batter. Let it simmer 
till quite smooth, putting to it a pinch of mace, 
some cayenne, and salt, if the latter is i*equired. 
Add the oysters, and give them a warm thn)ugh ; 
take it oS the fire and leave to cool. Have some 
good puff paste, cut with a round cutter, cutting 
another smaller round inside the large one, but only 
half through the paste; bake as they are, when 
done, take out the inner round cai'efully, keeping 
the top piece ; scoop out the inside of the patty a 
little, put in some of the oyster mixture, place the 
little round of paste -just over it lightly. Make 
them very hot, and serve. Some prefer the oysters 
put in whole, in which case they are better warmed 
through first in their own liquor, or they do not get 
cooked enough ; but they must on no account boil, 
or they will be like leather. Still it is safer always 
to warm them through first, whichever way they 
are to be used, as they will keep better.

over the fire in a little water to blancli for a few 
minutes (if there is enough liquor to warm them in, 
it is better than water) ; take out the oysters, keep 
the liquor, beard the oysters, and lay them on a 
sieve, then on to a cloth separately to dry. Break 
a fresh egg on a plate, beat well with a fork ; have 
about a quarter of a lb. of bread crumbs, to which 
has been added a spoonful of chopped parsley, a 
little grated nutmeg, and a little pepper. Dip each 
oyster first in the egg, then in the bread crumbs. 
Put them into a small wire basket, fry for one 
minute in very hot lard. They may, instead of 
being fried, be put on to a flat plate, with some 
melted butter on it, in the oven for ten minutes, 
and then browned with a salamander. 

Curry. 186. 

It is not difficult to cook a curry ; one great point 
is, to learn to simmer slowly and veiy gently ; then 
there is the mixing in the powder, and lastly the 
order in which all the various things should be 
added. 

Chicken Curry. 187. 

Take a young chicken, cut it up as for a fricassee, 
dredge the pieces with flour, and put them on one 
side. Take all the pieces of chicken that can't be 
used for the curry, such as the neck and head, feet, 
pinions, bones, and any odd scraps of meat that can 
be spared ; put all into a saucepan, with about a 
pint of water, an onion, and carrot cut up, a bit of 
celery, half a dozen peppercorns, a pinch of salt and 
sugar, and let it boil gently till reduced to half the 
quantity. Put 1 or 2 oz. of butter, according to the 
size of your curry, into a stewpan, with a few slices 
of onion, let it simmer till the onion is quite yellow- 
brown ; then add 2 tablespoonf uls of curry powder, 
or 1 of powder and 1 of curry ip«i.Hte, if you have it ; 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 81 

stir this well ronnd with the bntter and onions, 
adding bj degrees a wineglassful of cocoannt milk 
and as much of the broth (which must first be 
strained) as will make, after all has simmered for a 
quarter of an hour, a lich, thick curry gi-avy ; put 
this on a cool part of youi' stove while you fry the 
chicken. Put into a frying-pan 2 oz. of butter or 
lard, let it fry a minute or two, then put in the 
pieces of chicken and fry them lightly. As soon as 
they are done, put them into the cuiTy sauce, letting 
them lie in that for half an houi* ; then put youi* 
pan over a gentle fire. If there is not sauce enough 
to cover the chicken, add a little more of the broth, 
or stock from the bones, and let all simmer gently 
together for half an hour, or till the chicken is 
tender. It is better to put the cocoanut milk in 
when the pieces of chicken are added, instead of 
earlier. 

A Dry Curry. 188. 

Proceed as above, but at the end take the lid ofE 
the pan, and allow it to simmer longer to i^educe the 
gravy, stirring it constantly with a spoon, to pre- 
vent its burning. 

CURBY MADE WITH COOKKD MeAT. 189. 

Put 1 OZ. of butter into a frying-pan, and a little 
sliced onion, add 1| table-spoonfuls of curry powder 
(after the onion is browned), and a small pinch of 
powdered cloves or allspice; then, by degrees, as 
much stock as will make a thick gravy, letting it 
simmer all the time ; take your pan off, and put in 
the pieces of meat ; lamb, mutton, or veal are best, 
cut into neat pieces like dice, and free from skin or 
fat ; let the pan stand by the side of the fire, but not 
even simmer for half an hour or more, stirring the 
meat once or twice to keep it all covered in the 
sauce ; then put your pan near ttie fii^, ^^^ ^"^rvs^^*

glass of almond water, and let all simmer gently for 
twenty minntes. Should the gravy become too 
thick, a little more stock can always be stirred in. 

Curried Mince. 190. 

This may be made as above, only adding to the 
onions and butter a little finely-chopped apple ; then 
mix in the powder and gravy, and lastly the minced 
meat, and stir all together over a slow fire for twenty 
minntes. 

Curried Fish or Oysters. 191. 

Any fresh, cooked, or tinned fish can be cnrried. 
Take out all the bones, skin, etc., and break the fish 
into small, neat pieces. Put 1 to 2 oz. of butter into 
a saucepan, when it boils add an onion cut in very 
thin slices, let it fry, then stir in 1 to 2 table-spoon- 
fuls of curry powder, according to the quantity you 
wish to have; make it smooth, stirring with a 
wooden spoon, add your stock, or, if you are short, 
hot water will do ; whichever it is, it should be hot 
before it is added. Mix well, cover the pan, and let 
the whole boil. Grate a table-spoonful of cocoanut, 
chop a sour apple, add these to the gravy, let it sim- 
mer till the apple is dissolved, season with what salt 
is required; now put in your fish with a wine- 
glassful of cocoanut milk and the strained juice of 
half a lemon. Let this simmer gently until the fish 
is cooked, stirring now and again with a wooden 
spoon, and serve very hot. Rice boiled should be 
served with curry in another dish. Oysters may be 
curried in the same way. 

To Boil Rice for Curry. 192. 

Sift and clean the rice well (about 6 oz. will make 

a fair-sized dish) ; put it into three pints of boiling 

water, with a pinch of sugar and a saltspoon of salt. 

Stir the grains once or tmce >n\\»\i %. «»^oon while 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 83 

they are boiling, and in twelve or fourteen minutes 
try them by rubbing them between the finger and 
thumb. As soon as the rice is tender, throw in a 
cup of cold water, take the pan off the fire, and 
drain every drop of water from it; it is safer to 
drain the rice into a sieve. Wipe your pan out 
quite dry, and then, after shaking all the moistui-e 
fix)m the rice, return it to the hot, dry pan, put a 
cloth over the top, and set it on a hot stove (but not 
where it can bum) until all the grains separate. 

To Boil Rice. No. 2. 193. 

Wash ^ a lb. of Patna rice well in cold water, 
drain and pick out any bits ; put it on to the fire in 
2 quarts of cold water, bring it gently to the boil, 
stirring it at first once or twice with a wooden 
spoon ; boil slowly for fifteen minutes, remove the 
scum, and throw in a teaspoonful of salt ; drain on 
to a large sieve, and let it stand for ten to fifteen 
minutes in front of the fire until quite dry and every 
grain is separate. It should be touched as little as 
possible. 

To Make Cocoanut Milk. 194. 

Scrape the white part of a small cocoanut, put it 
into a basin or jar, and pour on to it about half a 
pint of boiling water ; cover the jar and leave to 
become cold, then strain for use. Cocoanut milk 
should be added to curries towards the last, like 
cream in soups. 

Almond Milk for Curry. 195. 

Blanch and pound, or grate, from 2 to 3 oz. of 
sweet almonds, pour on to the paste a little boiling 
water, leave till cold, and strain. Half a coffee- 
cupful of this and half of cocoanut milk may be 
used for a change with curry, but some of either 
should always be added. The ftovoTxr oi ^TsarsKa^

may be varied by using chopped fennel, or bay 
leaves, apple, lemon juice, currant jelly, or a little 
chutney. If you have no curry paste, only the 
powder, you can add a saltspoonful of powdered 
cloves, cinnamon, or allspice if liked, or half the 
quantity for a small curry. If the curry powder 
alone does not thicken the gravy enough, a little 
flour or cornflour can be mixed with the powder. 

Curried Sweetbreads. 196. 

Wash and soak one or two sweetbreads, put them 
into some boiling water with a little salt, an onion, 
and a bit of parsley, let them simmer for ten 
minutes (any pale broth is better than water) ; take 
them out, leave them to drain and get quite cold ; 
then cut them into slices, about half an inch thick, 
flour them, and fry lightly. Have some good curry 
made, as in the recipes given above, put the slices 
into this, and stew gently for twenty minutes; 
cocoanut milk must be added with the sweetbread, 
or about ten minutes before serving. The sweet- 
bread can be put to the curry plain, without frying, 
if preferred. 



REMARKS ON THE COOKING OF 
VEGETABLES. 



All vegetables, except artichokes, which are better 
for being kept a day or two, should be gathered 
fresh; this applies, of course, to green vegetables. 
If they cannot be brought in straight from the 
garden, they should be kept in as cool a place as 
possible, and put into cold water for some time 
before using. Cai'e should be taken to di'ain all 
vegetables well before serving, and send them up 
very hot. Only di'ied peas or beans, and Jerusalem 
artichokes, are put into cold water for cooking. All 
others, except potatoes, require plenty of fast boil- 
ing water, which should be ready salted and 
skimmed before they are thrown into it. All 
cabbages, cauliflowers, etc., should be carefully 
cleared from insects ; put them for half an hour in 
a pan of strong brine with the stalks uppermost. 
About a 1^ of a lb. of salt to a quart of water will 
answer for this pui^pose, and if strained daily it 
will keep a week. To keep vegetables a good 
colour, they should be put into plenty of boiling 
water, salted, and skimmed, without a lid to the 
pan. To 2 quarts of water put 1 oz. of salt, ^ a 
saltspoonful of carbonate of soda, or a small bit of 
soda the size of a small nut. Good, cleai* dripping 
answers for frying vegetables as well as lard. 

Potato Balls. 197. 
Mash potatoes well and stiff, add salt and a little 
butter, make up into small balls, egg and bread- 
crumb well over, and fry a light brown in bo\l\w^ 
lard or heef dripping,

Potato Souffles. 198. 

Take four or six good-sized potatoes, wash and 
clean well, cut off a piece at one end, so that they 
will stand np. Boast them gently in the oven, 
when done cut a large enough piece off the top to 
get the potato out, but do not break the skin; 
work the potato quite smooth, and mix well with 
pepper, salt, and a little anchovy or chopped par- 
sley. Take the whites of 2 eggs, and beat to a stiff 
froth, mix this lightly with the potatoes, return all 
into the skins, put them into the oven to become 
quite hot, serve standing up on a small dish with a 
cut paper under. 

Potatoes in Cases. 199. 

Take 6 souffle cases, boil and mash a few potatoes, 
mix with a little salt, pepper, and cream, beat up 
the white of an egg, add it, put all into the cases, 
letting it rise in a point above the top ; put into the 
oven for a few minutes to get hot, and brown with 
a salamander. These do well to send in with game. 

Roasted Potatoes (Buttered). 200, 

Wash and clean large mealy potatoes, roast in the 
oven ; when done, cut the skms in two, take out all 
the potato, mash well with butter, salt, cream, and 
pepper; put the mixture back in the skins, and 
press the two together to look like whole potatoes, 
return to the oven till quite hot. Serve on a neatly

taking care to keep all the heads even in the dish. 
Serve hot. Melted butter is often poured over the 
asparagus, or served in a sauce boat. The yolk of 
an egg improves the sauce for this vegetable. As-

boiling. Boil with the stalk end uppermost. Serve 
with good melted butter.

Trim off the outside leaves, cut the stems quite 
close ; put them for an hour into plenty of cold 
water with a handful of salt in it, to draw out any 
insects, then wash, and examine them well to see 
that they are quite clean. Put the cauliflowers into 
a pan of boiling water, salted as for asparagus, and

Remarks on Mixing Sauces. 

In any sauces, cornflour can be used instead of 
flour. It is more easily mixed, and is softer to the 
taste. If flour is used, it should be mixed very 
carefully, and well boiled to take off the rawness. 
If not well mixed and carefully stirred while boil- 
ing, any sauce will become lumpy. There is a great 
art in mixing sauces : a cook should be very careful 
to see they are nicely flavoured, as even an extra 
pinch of pepper or salt will often make a difference.

3 eggs, ^ of a pint of cream, small pincb of salt, 
2 table-spoonfuls of sifted sugar. Separate the whites 
from the yolks of the eggs, take out any specks ; 
beat the whites to a stiff froth • beat up the yolks, 
add to them the cream, sugar, etc., then beat in the 
whites. Have your omelette-pan ready with 2 oz. 
of butter melted in it. Pour in the mixture, 
stir a little until it begins to set ; when it has risen 
nicely, put the pan in the oven for about five 
minutes to set. The omelette-pan should be small, 
or a very small frying-pan should be uBed, as the 
omelette must not be thin. Omelettes must never 
be turned in the pan ; if not browned enough, a hot 
salamander can be held over them. They should 
be served very quickly with preserve over half, and 
the other side turned over it, like a turnover. 
Some people use only eggs, no cream ; in this case, 
4 or 6 are required, according to the size of the 
omelette.

pieces in, and fry a nice brown, but not hai^l ; drain 
very well, serve in a ring ©n paper in a glass dish, 
and sift sugar over. The batter may be made richer 
by using more eggs, and cream instead of milk.

spoonful of cornflour, mix smooth with a cup of 
milk, thicken it a little over the fire, add to it 3 oz. 
of loaf sugar, 2 oz. of butter, and mix lightly to- 
gether ; when a little cool, stir in the yolks of 3 
eggs, put it over the fire again, and stir until it 
begins to thicken ; add lemon or vanilla flavouring. 
Take a white pie-dish, spread the apples thickly at 
the bottom, pour the mixture gently over them, and 
put it into the oven until it sets. Beat up the 
whites of the eggs to a strong froth, put them on 
the top of the soufli^, brown in the oven, and serve 
at onoe.

and any flavouring you like, a teacupful of good 
milk, and sugar to taste ; mix well, beat the whites 
of the 3 eggs, and add. Bake in a shallow dish or tin 
for half an hour or rather more. Serve at once. 
Souffles require care in baking and in beating the 
eggs well, the lightness of them depending much 
on these points. They must always be served the 
moment they are taken from the oven, or they will 
fall. Any preserve may be put at the bottom of the 
dish before the souffle is put in, and baked with it, 
instead of plain.

2 table- spoonfuls of sifted sugar, and f a pint of 
cream. Beat up the whites of 2 eggs to a froth,

Mix in the yolks of 4 eggs, 4 oz. of loaf sugar, and

fifteen minutes ; add a few drops of Nelson's essence 
of lemon, butter a mould, and pour in the rhubarb. 
Next day, dip the mould in hot water, and turn the 
rhubarb out on a glass dish. Serve with a custard 
made with the yolks of 2 eggs stirred into | a pint 
of milk, about 4 or 5 lumps of loaf sugar ; simmer 
till thick, add essence of vanilla or almonds. 

Rhubarb Compete. 367. 

Prepare rhubarb as above, leave out the gelatine, 
pnt it into a round, shallow pie-dish; beat the 2 
whites of eggs left from the custard to a stiff froth, 
adding a J of a lb. of sifted loaf sugar as you beat, 
lay it on the top of the rhubarb, and bake a pale 
brown. 2 oz. of sifted sugar will make it stiff 
enough to bake. 



PASTRY, PIES, Etc. 



All pastry is better made in a cool place, and 
everything shonld be perfectly clean and sweet. A 
cook should wash her hands in hot water and wipe 
them very dry before she begins her pastry. Many 
cooks and housekeepers think that pastry can only 
be made with butter; this is a mistake, for even 
very good puff pastry, such as is used for mince 
pies, patties, etc., can be made with good sweet lard. 
Beef dripping also makes yery good common pastiy ; 
it must be sweet and not burnt or too brown, and 
must be rubbed carefully into the flour. For all 
puddings and pies to be eaten hot, it will be found 
as good as the best lard or butter. All pastry 
should be mixed with cold spring water ; for puff 
paste a little lemon juice may be added ; the water 
should be added by degrees, and care must be taken 
not to put too much, for all pastry will be rendered 
tough and uneatable if flour has to be added after it 
is mixed. Pastry must not be too much fingered, 
nor rolled more than is necessary. 

Good Pastry fob Meat Pies. 368. 

Weigh 6 oz. of lard to every 1 lb. of flour. Rub 
the lard well into the flour until there are no lumps 
left at all, and it is perfectly smooth. Add as much 
cold water as will make it into a stiff paste ; stir it 
round with your hand as you add the water, so as 
to mix in all the flour. Put it on your board or 
slab, and roll out the thickness it is required. For 
a meat pie to be eaten hot, or a plain hot apple 

U4 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 136 

pudding, beef dripping will be found to answer as 
well as lard. A little salt put into the flour im- 
proves pastry. 

Common Suet Crust for Pies or Boiled 
Puddings. 369. 

Take 6 or 8 oz. of good beef suet, remove from it 
all skin ; chop or pound it very fine, rub it into 1 
lb. of flour ; add a little salt, and mix with cold 
water. Roll out at once. This is only good when 
the pies or puddings are to be used hot. 

Short Crust. 370. 

To 6 08. of flour, take 3 02. of butter. Put the 
flour and butter into a basin, and pinch off little 
bits of the butter with your fingers, and rub it into 
the flour until all is smooth and well mixed. Then 
moisten with as little water as possible (a dessert- 
spoonful ought to be enough, if the butter is well 
rubbed in), as the less water you use the shorter 
the crust will be. Put the paste on your board, and 
roll out the thickness required. This will make 
enough to cover a small fruit tart; and if well 
made is extremely good for all fruit tarts. 

Useful Paste. 371. 

Take 1 lb. of flour, rub well into it with the 
hands 8 oz. of lard, until it is all like flour ; add a 
pinch of salt, and enough cold water to form into 
a smooth paste. Add the water a little at a time, 
and so gather up the flour with the hand, for if it 
becomes too wet it tastes sodden and is not fit to 
eat. Toung cooks often make this mistake of

Paste for Preserve Puffs and Turnovers. 372. 

Rub a J lb. of butter into 1 lb. of flour till it is as 
fine as possible. Mix witb a little cold water, roll 
oiit twice ; take 6 oz. more butter, put it on your 
paste in little bits, double over and roll out again ; 
repeat this two or three times until the butter is 
used up. Cut into shapes for your puffs and turn- 
overs. Bake with preserve in each. This can be 
made with lard instead of butter. 

Puff Paste. 373. 

Put 1 lb. of flour on your paste-board, work into 
it 4 oz. of butter with your hands. Mix with a 
little cold water, and roll out. Take 4 oz. more 
butter, put half of it on your paste in little bits ; 
double over, roll, then repeat with the rest of the 
butter. Next roll out the paste thin ; take a clean 
thin cloth, dip it into cold spring water, ring out 
tight, lay it over your paste, roll both up together 
very lightly, leave it in a cool place all night. Take 
out the cloth next day, fold your paste over, and 
give it one roll out before cutting it into the shapes 
you require. 

Puff Paste, No. 2. 374. 

Half a lb. of flour, ^ lb. of butter. Rub a bit of 
the butter, the size of a walnut, into the flour dry ; 
mix the flour into a light paste with a little cold 
water, mixing a few drops of lemon juice with the 
water ; flatten the rest of the butter in a wet cloth. 
Take the paste, pull it out with your hand the size 
of a plate, and lay the butter in it ; fold the paste 
over it and leave for ten minutes, beat well, roll 
out thin, and fold in six folds: repeat this three 
times, waiting ten minutes between each. It is then 
ready for use. In both these recipes good fresh 
lard can be used instead oi "bulter, ^ti^\% «.% ^ood.

Sweet Biscuit Paste. 375. 

1 lb. of fine flour, 6 oz. of butter rubbed into it, 
-^ oz. of fine sifted loaf sugar, the yolks of 2 eggs, 
«md a very little milk. Mix well and roll, but not 
*€oo mucb. This is liked by some for lining patty- 
pans, in which preserves or cheesecakes are baked.

"the tms with paste, then fill them with whole rice 
^r flour, and bake till quite set. Next clean out the 
3:ice, fill with the custard, and return to the oven 
Tmtil it is set. 

Venison Pasty. 376. 

Cut your meat in neat pieces, either from the 
side or shoulder. It improves the meat to rub it 
over with sugar for two or three days before it is 
required ; but when it is wanted, wipe it perfectly 
clean and dry. Put a good crust round the sides of 
your dish, but not at the bottom ; lay in the pieces 
of venison with fat between each piece, having first 
put some butter, pepper, and salt at the bottom of 
your dish, the dish must be well filled with the meat 
and fat. The venison bones must be well boiled 
with some good mutton bones, pepper, and salt; 
put i a pint of this g^avy cold into the pie, and put 
butter on the top of the venison ; cover with a good 
rich crust. Keep the rest of the gravy until the 
pie is baked, then put it in through a funnel quite 
hot, and shake the dish to mix it well. 

Chicken or Eabbit Pie. 377. 

Cut up 2 young rabbits, season well with salt, 
pepper, nutmeg, and mace. Take a pie-dish, put in 
your rabbits neatly in joints, then a layer of cold 
ham or bacon, and repeat until your dish is full. 
Fill up with some broth nicely seasoned, which may 
be made from the heads, breast\>OTve^^ «sA Vj^%

pieces off the legs of the rabbits, and a beef or veal 
bone. Cover the pie with a nice crust, and bake. 
Fowl or chicken pie can be made the same way, 
only a couple of hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices and 
put in layers with the ham, are an improyement 
to it. 

Pigeon or Partridos Pie. 378, 

Put at the bottom of a pie-dish a few pieces of 
tender beef or veal. Take 4 pigeons, nicely cleaned, 
pound a little ham in a mortar with the livers of 
the pigeons. Add the yolks of 3 hard-boiled eggs, 
pepper, salt, and a little mace ; mix it with abont 
2 oz. of butter, and put a lump into the inside of 
each pigeon, and lay them neatly over the veal. 
Fill the dish with broth, and put a crust on the top. 
Stick the feet of the pigeons in the centre. This 
pie can be eaten hot or cold. Partridge pie can be 
made the same way. 

GiBLET Pie. 379. 

Clean goose or duck giblets well, stew them 
slowly until quite tender, in a small quantity of 
water, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. When cold put them into a pie-dish ; if not 
enough to fill it, put a little beef or veal at the 
bottom. The gravy the giblets were stewed in 
should be put into the pie. Cover with a crust, 
and bake. A small cupful of cream is considered 
an improvement to this pie, put in through a funnel 
directly it is done baking. 

Duck Pie. 380. 

Joint 2 ducks, young ones, remove the back bones, 
f xy the other joints, neatly out, with slices of Spanisli 
onion for twenty minutes. The pieces of duck should 
be seasoned with salt, oayenxi^, wci^ li^ little sage. 



MENU COOKERY BOOK. 139 

Wash the giblets, and put on to simmer with a 
little of the fried onion and the back bones for two 
hours in a pint of cold water, adding a bunch of 
parsley and a strip of lemon rind. Lay the pieces 
of duck in a pie-dish, mix in the giblets, strain the 
gravy, add to it ^ a glass of port wine, a little 
mushroom ketchup, salt, and pepper, and pour it 
into the dish ; cover with paste made with J of a lb. 
of flour, 4 oz. of lard, 2 oz. of butter, salt, and a J 
of a pint of milk. Bake in a moderate oven. K 
this pie is preferred cold, a |^ of an oz. of Nelson's 
gelatine can be added to the gravy to set it. 

Pork Pie. 381. 

Take 3 or 4 lbs. of the loin or griskin of pork, cut 
the meat off the bones into pieces about two inches 
in size, pepper and salt them well, take ofE all the 
skin, but a little fat may be added if liked ; pass all 
through the mincing-machine until it is like sausage 
meat. Put the bones, and any bits of skin, on the 
fire in some cold water, let them simmer for a 
couple of hours, then strain and leave to get cold. 
Weigh 1 lb. of flour, rub into it 6 oz. of lard till 

2uite smooth, mix with cold water into a stiff paste. 
[ave ready some tin (oval or round) lings, about 
three inches high ; roll, and cut your paste to line 
the rings at the sides and bottom ; put in your 
minced pork, cover with paste, and pinch the edges 
well together, brush over with egg or milk, and 
bake. This pie must be baked in a modeitite oven, 
as the meat takes a long time to soak, and a quick 
oven will spoil it ; it will take from two to two and 
a half hours to bake. When cold, the cold gravy 
from the bones must be added through a funnel in 
the centre. If this gravy is not set, a little of 
Nelson's gelatine should be added to it, and it 
should be highly seasoned wit\i pep^evj %,iA ««JsJ^*

Veal and Ham Pie. 382. 

Cut some neat pieces of veal from a loin or leg of 
veal, take ofE all pieces of skin, take a pie-dish, lay 
in a layer of veal, sprinkle salt and pepper over, 
cover with a layer of cooked ham, cut in thin slices, 
and then a layer of hard-boiled eggs ; repeat until 
the dish is full ; put in some weak veal stock, cover 
with a good paste, and bake in a moderate oven. A 
veal and ham pie can also be made like the pork 
pie, raised, putting about a |^ of a lb. of ham to a 
lb. of veal. 

Beef Pie. 383. 

Cut neat pieces of beef free from skin from a 
tender lean piece of beef, fill a pie-dish neatly, 
seasoning well with pepper and salt ; fill up with 
weak stock or a little water, and cover with a 
good crust. Should the beef not be tender, it is 
better before putting on the paste to cover it with a 
tin plate, and stew it gently in the oven for two 
hours. 

French Pie. 384. 

Mince some cold veal fine, with a little ham, 
season highly with pepper, salt, mace, and a little 
grated lemon peel, mix this with a little stock, a bit 
of butter, and a little thin cream, put a layer of this 
at the bottom of a pie-dish. Take about 20 good 
oysters, take off the beards, put them in the dish 
over the meat, then put another layer of the minced 
meat, and cover the whole with bread crumbs ; put 
pieces of butter on the top, and bake for half an 
hour. The dish may be buttered before the meat is 
put in, and lined all round and at the bottom with 
fine bread crumbs.

hetween the paste and dish. Any of the tinned 
American fruits make good winter tarts ; in summer 
no tarts are better than cherries, raspberries and 
currants, or greengage. The paste for all summer 
fruit tarts should be made very short, and a little 
sweet. 

Rice Cheesecakes. 386. 

Take 2 eggs, and their weights in butter, loaf 
sugar, and ground rice ; add a few blanched and 
pounded sweet almonds, and 2 bitter ones ; or, if 
preferred, vanilla or lemon may be used for flavour- 
ing. Line patty-pans with a good puff or short 
paste, fill with the above mixture after it has been 
well beaten together, and bake. Half this quantity 
will make a small dish. 

Curd Cheesecakes. 387. 

1 pint of buttermilk, 1 egg, 1 table-spoonful of 
flour, and 1 quart of skim-milk. Set the milk on 
the fire, beat up the egg, flour, and buttermilk ; 
when the milk just begins to boil, stir them into it, 
let it simmer till the whey rises clear round the 
pan. Take it off the fire, and leave till cold ; pour 
into a coarse cloth, and hang to drip. New milk 
makes this richer. Sugar, currants, and nutmeg 
can be mixed with the curds. Line your patty- 
pans with good paste, fill, and bake.

be mixed with the white of an egg to moisten it,

with preserve or whipped cream. If not wanted to 
keep, the white of an egg can be mixed in at first, 
and it need not be dried over the fire. 



Jam Roll. 396. 

A 5^ of a lb of dust sugar, 2 eggs, the weight of 
one egg in flour ; beat the yolks of the eggs very- 
well, add the sugar, mix well, beat the whites to a 
very stiff froth, mix in lightly, add the floor by 
degrees beating all the time. Butter a Yorkshire 
pudding tin, put in the mixture and bake in a quick 
oven from ten to fifteen minutes, turn out carefully 
and quickly on to your pastry board, which should 
be sprinkled with sugar, spread jam quickly over 
the cake and roll. If too much baked or not quickly 
rolled up, it becomes stiff and breaks. 

Apple Cheesecakes. 397.

Beat the eggs well, mix with the sugar, apples, and 
lemon ; beat and melt the butter a veiy little, and 
add last ; stir over the fire until the whole is well 
mixed, but do not let it boil. Line tartlet-tins with 
paste, fill with the mixture, and bake twenty 
minutes. Apple tartlets are also good filled with 
apples, prepared as for apple sauce, only adding a 
little lemon, and putting cross-bars of paste over 
the apples and bake ; before they are cold spread 
apple jelly over the top of each tartlet. They must 
be kept in a dry place till ^«i.Ti\>^^. 



RBMAEKS ON CREAMS, JELLIES, ETC. 



Everything used for the making of these things 
Blionld be particularly sweet and clean. Saucepans 
should be kept on purpose for boiling cream, and a 
preserving pan is as good as any other for boiling 
jelly ; anything that has had fat or grease in it, and 
is not well scoured, will quite spoil your sweets. A 
jelly bag, after it has been used, must be well 
scalded and dried ; if put by damp it will smell stale 
and musty. Moulds and tins should all be well 
scoured before they are put by, and when required 
for creams or jelly should stand for some time in 
clean spring water. Eggs are best broken sepa- 
rately into a cup, as one bad one will spoil every- 
thing. Cream and milk must be quite fresh and 
sweet. I strongly recommend Nelson's gelatine for 
all solid sweets, jellies, etc. ; it is far before any 
other, has no disagreeable taste, and is perfectly 
pure and wholesome. I prefer it to anything else 
of the same kind, and I think any one who has once 
tried it, will never again forsake the use of it. Re- 
member always to soak it some hours in a little 
cold water before using, and then to put enough 
boiling water, milk, or stock to dissolve it. If used 
this way it will never fail to please.

spoonful of Carolina rice in a little milk till tender 
with a small bit of butter and a pinch of salt ; strain 
the rice when done from the milk, and add the rice 
to the cream by degrees as you whip the cream. It

but is not necessary. Put some greengage or other 
jam at the bottom of a glass dish, covering it about 
a quarter of an inch thick; when the cream is nearly 
cold pour it gently over the preserve and leave it to

ries, or pieces of citron, or any candied fruits may 
be used instead of pine-apple ; then it will require 
a little brandy or sweet wine instead of syrup.

with it. A few bits of cake, cut with small cutters 
into pretty shapes, and coloured with a little 
cochineal, put on to the top of the cream, makes a 
pretty finish and ornament to this dish. 

Whipped Cream. 416. 

For this purpose cream should always be thick, 
but fresh ; and it is best from one cow, not mixed 
with other cream. Always whip it in a cool place ; 
if the weather is hot, put the cream into a basin, 
and plunge that into a basin of very cold water, but 
not high enough to let any get to the cream, and 
whip it. Before whipping, put into the cream a 
little sugar, a few drops of vanilla or almond 
jQavouring. About ^ a pint of good cream is enough 
for a small dish. It is best not to whip it long 
before you require it. If the cream is thick it 
should not take more than 5 or 10 minutes to whip. 

Solid Custard in Cups. 417. 

Soak I an oz. of Nelson's gelatine in a little milk 
for a few hours, take ^ a pint of milk, boil it and 
pour over the gelatine ; add ^ a pint of cream, sugar 
to taste, and a few drops of essence of ratafias. 
Put some preserved cherries, with the stones taken 
out, at the bottom of your custard glasses ; add 
the cream when nearly cold. Put some pistachio 
almonds on the top of each custard, cut in small 
pieces and sprinkled on. 

Blanc Mange. 418. 

1 oz. of gelatine soaked in enough milk to cover 
it for two or three hours. Take a pint of milk, put

it on the fire with, half the rind of a lemon cut very 
thin ; when quite boiling pour it over the gelatine, 
add 2 or 3 oz. of loaf sugar, a pint of thin cream, 
and essence of almonds to taste ; give it one warm 
over the fire, and leave it to cool ; take out the lemon 
peel. Colour half of it with cochineal ; take a mould 
that has been in water, and put in the pink about 
half full ; leave it to get cold, then add some of the 
white, but that must have been kept just warm. 
Part of it may be made a nice yellow by adding the 
yolks of 2 eggs. Any cream which is wanted in two 
colours must be done in this way, the one colour 
must be allowed to get quite cold in the mould 
before the other is added, or they will mix, and 
both be spoilt. 

Custard. 419. 

Take the yolks of 2 eggs beaten, ^ a pint of thin 
cream, a little sugar, and stir over the fire until it 
thickens, but be careful it does not boil ; add essence 
of almonds to taste. If your cream is good, the yolks 
of 3 eggs are enough for rather more than double 
this quantity. A common custard may be made 
with milk, 2 table-spoonfuls of cornflour, and the 
yolks of one or two eggs. Or you may use Ber- 
wick's custard powder, which does not require any 
eggs at all. 

Trifle. 420. 

Mix some sherry and brandy or rum together on 
a soup plate, take 1 dozen penny sponge cakes, cut 
them in 2 or 3 thin slices, dip them in the wine, and 
lay them on a glass dish ; next put a layer of jan 
(apricot, or greengage) ; then some ratafias, repes 
the sponge cake, and put a different jam on it — ^plu* 
jelly, or anything like that — and so on until the di' 
is three-parts full. Make a good custard (the yol 
of 3 egga to rather more than a pint of cream), wl 
cold, put it over tlie tri^e «ti^ \^«i.^^ \\i \<jk ^tr

two or three hours. Whip np some good cream, 
flavom^ed and sweetened, last of all, and cover thick 
all over the trifle. 

Orange Jelly. 421. 

Take 1 oz. of Nelson's gelatine, put it to soak in 
enough cold water to cover it for three hours, or 
over-night ; when swelled to about double the size, 
pour on it a pint of boiling water, stir till dissolved ; 
add ^ a lb. of loaf sugar and the juice of as many- 
oranges as will make a pint (about 8, if they are 
good ones), add the juice of one lemon. If the 
oranges are sweet, it may not require quite so much 
sugar. If the sugar has not quite melted, give it 
one boil, and stiuin through a piece of muslin, but 
orange jelly is better not cleared. A glass of sherry 
is good added to the above ; let it be nearly cold, 
then put it into moulds which have been in cold 
water. A pinch of Nelson's citric acid can be used 
instead of lemon. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. 422. 

Put an ox foot, or 2 calf's feet, into a stewpan 
with 3 quarts of water, boil slowly till reduced to 
half the quantity and all the meat has come off the 
bones, skun well, strain, and leave till cold. The 
next day take off every bit of fat, even wiping the 
top of the jelly with a clean cloth, or put clean blot- 
ting paper on it to get off every particle of fat ; put 
the jelly into a pan, but be careful not to take the 
sediment which will be at the bottom, add the thin 
rind of 2 lemons, the juice of 3, and loaf sugar to 
taste, about | a lb. Melt for a little over the fire, 
then stir in rather more than f a pint of strongly 
flavoured sherry ; have ready the whites and shells 
of 2 eggs, beaten a little, and pour into the \ell^ \ 
whisk well for a little over tlie fire *, Qio Tio\i X/^'^x^ "^

again, but let it boil for ten to fifteen minntes, take 
it off tbe fii'e very gently, let it stand to settle, put 
the eggshells and thick part into the bottom of 
your jelly- bag, then with a cup pour the jelly 
through by degrees. If not clear the first time, it 
may be passed through twice. The jelly-bag should 
be soaked in clean boiling water before it is used, 
shake it out as dry as possible, but still keep it hot 
near the fire while the jelly runs through. The ox 
foot will boil again for stock. 

Wine Jelly. 423. 

1 oz. of Nelson's gelatine, put in a basin, add | a 
pint of cold water ; let it stand three hours, when 
quite soaked add a large teaspoonf ul of citric acid 
(Nelson's is best) and | a lb. of loaf sugar ; pour cm 
to this a pint of boiling water, and stir till the gela- 
tine and sugar are dissolved ; then add ^ a pint of 
sherry (rather common sweet sherry is best) ; leave 
it to get nearly cold ; put it into moulds which have 
been in cold water. This jelly can be made with 
sweet wine, claret, or any other that is liked. If 
carefully made, it will be quite clear enough with- 
out being strained. It has the properties of being 
very strengthening, easily made, and not expensive, 
and is very good tasting. 

EiCE Croquettes. 424. 

A 1^ of a lb. of Carolina rice, boiled till tender in 
I a pint of milk, add 2 oz. of butter, 2 of loaf sugar, 
and the yolks of 2 eggs ; add essence of vanilla or 
almond, stir over the fire till thick, turn it on a dish 
to cool. Make up into balls, dip them in bread 
crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in bread 
crumbs. Fry quickly in boiling butter or lard. 
Serve on a cut paper, piled high, and sift sugar 
over.

mix well, but gently, with a spoon ; drop it on to 
"writing-paper the size and shape of half an egg cut . 
lengthways, dust thinly over with white sugar. 
Put the writing-paper on a board, as a baking-tin 
would get too hot at the bottom. Bake, in a very 
moderate oven, a very pale brown. Take them off 
the paper gently, take out the soft inside, and dry 
them before the fire. Keep in a tin box in a very 
dry, cool place. When wanted, fill one-half with 
whipped cream and another with preserve and put 
together to look like a whole large egg. The whites 
of 2 eggs will make a small dish.

some minutes. Have ready a large piece of butter 
in a frying-pan, and when boiling pour in the mix- 
ture. When it will hold together double it up;

BREAD SCONES, Etc. 



Mt remarks on bread, also all my recipes for Tna,1dTig 
it, scones, tea cakes, etc., will be entirely in favour 
of the use of Yeatman's yeast powder. For bread, 
in my opinion, it is better than anything else. It 
is perfectly wholesome, the bread is very qnickly 
made, and if properly mixed no one can say a word 
against the goodness of it. We tried yeast for- 
merly ; either it was too bitter, or it would not rise, 
or in summer it was not to be had ; then German 
yeast, but I never cared for that. We have had no 
complaints since we began Yeatman's yeast powder. 
Many of my friends remark, "What good bread 
you have ; how do you make it ? " My answer is, 
"With Yeatman's yeast powder, to be got at all 
the stores." A cook on first using it is apt to make 
the bread too close, because she mil not put enough 
water to the fiour ; that is one great point, also it 
must be very lightly mixed, and at once put into a 
hot oven. The oven should be brisk at first, to al- 
low the bread to rise, then slower after, to bake it. 
The yeast powder is spoken of as " the perfection 
of baking powder ; " and for bread, I am quite sure 
there is nothing equal to it, althougb. for fancy 
bread and cakes we also use a good deal of Ber- 
wick's powder, which is extremely good for cakes, 
and which I can also strongly recommend to any 
young housekeepers; but Yeatman's only will an- 
swer for bread. I propose giving a few of his 
recipes, copied from a small book I have, and which 
we have tried and found to be excellent. One heaped

of flour. It will also be found to make pastry 
lighter ; and a teaspoonful of it will save an egg in 
plum, suet, and other puddings. Remember always 
to mix it dry into the flour £[rst. 

Bread. 544. 

5 lbs. of flour, 5 to 6 teaspoonfuls of Yeatman's 
yeast powder, 2 to 3 of salt; mix this well with 
the flour, then add 2|r pints of cold water, mixing 
it in lightly and by degrees with the hand until all 
the flour is taken up. Turn it out on your board, 
the dough requires very little kneading ; cut it with 
a knife into four equal-sized pieces, make them up 
into round or cottage loaves, put on to a baking- 
tin, and place at once in a hot oven. When fully 
risen, open the oven door for a moment to let off 
the steam. These loaves will take about one hour 
and ten minutes. The oven can be a little cooler 
after the bread has risen. 

To Bake a Tin Loaf. 545. 

Take 3 lbs. of flour, put into it 3 good large tea- 
spoonfuls of yeast powder, and 1 to 2 of salt ; mix 
with 1| pint of cold water as directed above ; flour 
a tin mould, and put in your bread. This will make 
two small loaves ; and for any one who has not been 
used to making bread in this way it is the easiest 
to commence with, as cooks are inclined at first not 
to put in the full quantity of water. The 3 lbs. of 
flour is easier to work up than the 5 lbs. 

Brown Bread. 546. 

This is good made with the brown floui'j but 
many prefer the " whole wheaten flour." Take 1 lb.

REMARKS ON CAKES, BXJNS, Etc. 



One great point in making cakes is, to have all 
your ingredients of the best : — fresh butter, fresh 
eggs, fine flour well dried, sugar carefully sifted, 
and in many cases warmed ; fruit well cleaned ; all 
big raisins stoned, stalks removed ; currants well 
washed, dried, and rubbed in a clean cloth, picking 
out all hard or dry bits from them. Salt butter is 
frequently used for cakes, because it is rather lower 
in price ; but it will often prove dearer in the end 
by spoiling your cake. If you are not sure about 
the freshness of your eggs, break each one in a cup 
first, as one bad egg wHl spoil a whole batch of 
cakes. My recipe for preserved eggs is most useful 
for eggs required for cake-making. Sound fresh 
eggs put into the lime in May, when they are at their 
cheapest, will be quite fresh for all cooking pur- 

r)ses in December, when eggs are at their dearest, 
wish strongly to recommend the use of Berwick's 
baking powder, for cakes. A teaspoonful put into 
the flour dry will save an egg in most cakes ; even 
sponge cakes are lighter for a little of it. No good 
housekeeper should ever be without it. 

Rich Plum Cake. 556. 

1 lb. fresh butter, 1 lb. moist sugar, 1| lb. dried 
flour, 2 lbs. currants, 1 lb. sultana raisins, f a lb.

almonds blanched and chopped, | an ounce of mixed 
spice, 1 wineglass of brandy, 10 eggs. Beat the

will cover the top of a cake made from the Tennis 
Cake recipe. Double quantity will be required to 
ice the cake all over.

When smooth, add the sugar, then the other 2 
whites, melt the chocolate, add that and the vanilla. 
Make this paste up into balls, wetting the Angers at 
intervals to prevent its sticking to the hand ; touch 
each ball on the top with the water to make them 
shine. Dry in a very cool oven until they are firm. 
These are very good for dessert, or for afternoon 
teas. 



PRESEEVES, LIQUORS, Etc. 



REMARKS ON KEEPING PRESERVES. 

A GREAT deal is said about covering prese2rves with 
paper dipped in brandy. I never have my pre- 
serves covered with more than one paper. That is 
merely common cap paper fastened on directly the 
jam is cold, either with white of egg or plain gnm, 
made from gum arabic and water. The great thing 
is to keep preserves in a cool dry place, not shut up 
in a cupboard, as the air should be allowed to circu- 
late round them. When I say f of a lb. of sugar to 
a lb. of fruit, remember I mean a lb., not a quart of 
fruit ; a quart is nearly a |^ of a lb. more than a lb. 



Orange Marmalade. 607. 

Weigh Seville oranges, allow double their weight 
in loaf sugar. Put the oranges whole in a large 
saucepan, cover them with cold water, putting a 
plate on the top of the fruit to keep them under the 
water. Boil them until a pin's head will go easily 
through the skin. Put the saucepan on one side to 
keep hot, but not to boil ; take the oranges out a 
few at a time, cut them into quarters, put the pulp 
on one plate away from the skin, cut the rind into 
very thin strips; next divide the pulp carefully 
from the pips, and any hard inside skin. The pulp 
and cut strips can be put together; the pips and 
hard bits may be returned to ^i\i^ -^^^^ in which 
the oranges were boiled, ^laicVi tclt3l«»\» "Vi^ ^-^x^^'bi^

kept. Put the sugar, strips, and pulp into a pre- 
serving pan, and strain the water over all. Boil 
quickly for half an hour, and skim while boiling. 
Three dozen oranges after being prepared will take 
quite one quart of the boiled water. This is ex- 
cellent marmalade, but it must be cut very thin, 
and the oranges must be well boiled at first. 

Smooth Marmalade. 608. 

2 lbs. of Seville oranges, 2 lbs. bitter oranges, 6 lbs. 
of loaf sugar. Cut the oranges, take out the pulp ; 
boil the skin till perfectly tender, changing the 
water to take off the bitter ; when cool scrape the 
coarse and thready part from the inside of the skin. 
Put the sugar in a preserving-pan, just cover it 
with water, and boil it to a clear syrup ; a little 
more water can be added if the first does not qxdte 
clear it. Pound the skins in a mortar, adding the 
pulp free from skin and pips ; mix this with the 
syrup, and boil the whole for twenty minutes. The 
grated rind and juice of 2 lemons to every 12 
oranges improves this. The sugar and water 
should boil about ten minutes. 



Vegetable Marrow Preserve. 609. 

Peel and core 6 lbs. of marrow, put it on a flat 
dish, cover it with 6 lbs. of broken loaf sugar, let 
it stand twenty-four hours ; the vegetable marrow 
should be cut after peeling into pieces about two 
inches long. Add the next day 3 lemons, cut in 
thin slices, taking out the pips, and 1\ oz. of 
bruised whole giuger. Boil the whole for one hour 
and a half, skim well. Take out the lemon and 
ginger before putting it into the jars. A wine- 
glass of brandy is an improvement yJst Vi^ixstfe ^^sa» 
done.

Bhubabb Jellt. 610. 

Cut up some red rhubarb in short pieces, then 
stew the rhubarb in the oven or over the fire until 
quite tender. Strain through a coarse cloth ; to each 
pint of juice put 1 lb. of loaf sugar. Boil quickly 
for twenty minutes to half an hour, by which time 
it should jelly. This is best made in the autumn, 
as rhubarb is stronger then and jellies better. 

Blackberry and Apple Cheese. 611. 

' Take equal quantities of apples, after they are 
peeled and cored, and blackberries ; bake them in a 
stone jar in the oven, or put them in a preserving 
pan, and stew until perfectly soft. Pulp through a 
hair sieve. Weigh the pulp, and to every lb. allow 
f of a lb. of loaf sugar. Boil the pulp alone for an 
hour, then add the sugar, ani boil for another hour. 
Put it into small jars very hot. It should turn out 
when cold quite a firm cheese. The hardest apples 
are the best for this. 

Blackberry Jelly. 612. 

Put some blackberries into a preserving-pan, cover 
the fruit with cold water. Boil for an hour. The 
fruit must then be put into a thin, clean towel, and 
left to strain for some hours. To every pint of 
juice allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar. Boil quickly for 
twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Damson Jam. 613. 

The fruit for this jam should be freshly gathered 

and very ripe. Split, stone, and weigh the fruit ; 

boil quickly for thirty minutes, then stir in half its 

weight in loaf sugar. Boil again for fifteen minutes, 

stirring and skimming. A more refined preserve is 

made by passing the fruit through a coarse sieve, 

and boiling it for twenty -niVimfc^^ ^^tt^r^ allowing | a 

lb. ot sugar to 1 lb. oi pnVp.

Damson Cheese. 614. 
Stew the fruit in the oven or over the fire until 
quite tender ; rub it Gainfully through a hair sieve ; 
keep about a quarter of the stones, break them, and 
blanch the kernels. Weigh the pulp ; to every lb. 
allow f of a lb. of loaf sugar. Boil the pulp alone 
for half an hour, then add the sugar, and boil again 
for three-quarters of an hour. Put in the kernels 
for the last ten minutes. 

Red Currant Jelly (Superior). 615. 
Pick the fruit fresh, and free it from the stalks ; 
put it mto a stone jar, and place the jar, covered, in 
a pan of cold water. Put both together over the 
fire, or in the oven, until the juice will pour off. 
Place the currants in a hair sieve ; after the juice 
has run through, press the currants very gently. 
Strain the juice a second time through a clean clotn, 
then measure it, allowing 1 lb. of loaf sugar to every 
pint of juice. Put the juice on the fire in a pre- 
serving-pan, let it boil five minutes, and skim it. 
Sift the sugar very fine, put it in the oven, let it get 
quite hot, so that you can only just bear your finger 
in it ; then shake it gently into the hot juice, stir- 
ring well all the time it is being added. When all 
the sugar is in, boil it quickly for eight to ten 
minutes; skim also if necessary. This jelly is 
beautiful. The currants are best mixed, half red 
ones and half white. 

Red Currant Jelly. 616. 
Put the fruit, after taking o£E the stalks, into a 
stone jar; leave it in a moderate oven all night. 
Strain the currants through a cloth ; to every pint 
of juice allow f of a lb. of loaf sugar, crushed small. 
Put both the juice and sugar into a preserving-pan 
over the fire. Boil quickly for twenty minxLtA^.. 
Skim well, and put into amaW \aT^.

Jelly made from Different Fruits. 617. 

During the preserving season I generally liave a 
few pots of jelly made from each pan of preserves, 
and I do not find that it spoils my jams at all. For 
instance, I make black currant, red currant, goose- 
berry, and plum jelly this way. For all common 
preserves I allow f of a lb. of loaf sugar to every 
1 lb. of fruit. The sugar must be broken small ; 
put the fruit and sugar into your pan, let the sugar 
melt, then boil quickly for twenty minutes to half 
an hour, skim carefully. Take the pan ofE the fire, 
take from it about 3 or 4 teacupfuis of juice, or as 
much as you think can be spared without mUking 
your jam dry. Strain the juice through a small 
gi'avy sieve into small jars. This will be found to 
jelly well. By this means a nice stock of different 
kinds of jelly can be procured, and no fruit is 
wasted. 

Strawberry Syrup. 618. 

This can be produced in the same way as given in 
the above recipe, only that strawberries can't spare 
too much juice to be taken from the jam ; nor will 
it jelly like the other fruits, and is therefore best 
put into wide-necked bottles. It is very nice put 
round boiled puddings. 

Black Butter. 619. 

Take equal quantities of strawberries, raspberries, 
gooseberries, and black and red currants. "Weigh 
the whole after carefully picking them free from 
stalks, etc. Allow to every pound of fruit f of u 
lb. of loaf sugar. Put the fruit on the fire, boil 
fifteen minutes, then add the sugar, and boil again 

twenty minutes. I have xieyeiT ^infe^ t\via -qreserye, 

but am told it is very good.

Apple Jelly. 620. 

Pare and core good cooking apples, put them into 
a preserving-pan, just cover them witn cold water. 
Let it come to the boil, stirring it now and again ; 
add the juice, and very thin rind of 4 lemons ; this 
quantity of lemon is required for a fair-sized pre- 
serving-panful of apples. . It must keep on boiling 
until the apples are in a pulp. Strain it gently 
through a fine hair sieve. To every pint of juice 
add f of a lb. of sifted loaf sugar. Boil it quickly 
for twenty minutes, or until it begins to jelly on the 
top. Just before it is done, add a small handful of 
strips of lemon peel from which all the white has 
been removed, and which should be cut nearly as 
fine as the bristle of a brush. The jelly should be 
put hot into small moulds or jars. It will turn out 
well, and should be quite clear if properly made. 

Apple Cheese. 621. 

Take the pulp which is left from the jelly, remove 
the pieces of lemon peel, and rub the ptdp through 
a hair sieve. Weigh the pulp ; to every 3 lbs. allow 
2 lbs. of loaf sugar and ihe juice of 1 lemon. Boil 
all together for one hour and a half, or till it sets. 
Put into flat open jars or saucers. This will be- 
come firm enough to turn out, or to be cut with a 
knife. 

Apple Marmalade. 622. 

Pare and core 6 lbs. of apples, put them into a 
preserving.pan, add enough cold water to cover the 
bottom of the pan about half an inch deep. Let 
them boil until quite soft, beat up the pulp to avoid 
having any lumps. Next add 3| lbs. of loaf sugar 
broken small, the juice and grated Tvcid oi % ssss:sS^

Strawberry Jam. 623. 

Pick the fruit as fresh as possible, and in quite 
dry 'weather; weigh it, and to every lb. of fruit 
allow f of a lb. of loaf sugar. Break the sugar fine, 
put it with the fruit into a preserving-pan, boil 
quickly for twenty-five minutes after it has come to 
the boil. Skim well. Should the season be a damp 
one, or the places for keeping jam not over dry, it is 
then better to boil it half an hour. This recipe will 
answer for all common fruit ; only black currants 
and gooseberries will require a little longer boiling. 

Strawberries in Red Currant Jelly. 624. 

Pick 4 lbs. of fine strawberries, allow f of a lb. of 
sifted loaf sugar to each lb. Put the strawberries 
on a flat dish, cover them with sugar, and leave them 
for three or four hours. Put all into a preserving 
pan, let the sugar melt, then add 1 pint of red cur- 
rant juice, well mixed with f of a lb. of sifted sugar. 
Boil all together for twenty to twenty-five minutes, 
skim, but stir as little as possible, so as not to break 
up the fruit. It should be nearly whole. 

Raspberry Jam. 625. 

Weigh your fruit, put it into an earthenware 
pan, and squeeze it with your hand gently on the 
top of the fruit, to break it a little and press out 
some of the juice. Have ready some sifted sugar, 
allowing f of a lb. to every lb. of fruit. Put the 
pulp on the fire alone ; when it just comes to the 
boil take it o£E and stir in the sugar. Put it again 
on the fire, stir till it begins to boil ; let it boil 
quickly for twelve to fifteen minutes, then put it 
into jars. Raspberry jam can also be made as in 
the recipe given for BtTSi»^\i«iTy ^am^ but twenty 
zninutea will boil it.

Black Currant Jelly. 626. 

Stew the fruit in the oven, strain through a hair 
sieve or cloth ; to every pint of juice allow f of a 
lb. of loaf sugar. Boil quickly for twenty minutes, 
or till it jellies. 

Pineapple Preserve. 627. 

Peel 2 or 3 foreign pines carefully, cut them into 
slices about a |^ of an inch thick ; weigh the fruit, 
and allow f of a lb. of sugar to every lb. of fruit. 
Break the sugar very fine, lay the pine on a dish 
and cover it with the sugar; let it stand twelve 
hours, pour ofE the syrup, and boil it for twenty 
minutes ; let it get cold, then pour it again over the 
slices of pine, let them stand another twelve hours. 
After, boil the whole together for twenty minutes 
and put into jars. 

Orleans Plum Preserve. 628. 

Pick the fruit very ripe, skin and stone it, weigh 
it ; allow f of a lb. oi loaf sugar to every lb of fruit, 
put all on the fire together in a preserving-pan ; 
boil quickly for half an hour. Skim it well ; break 
half the stones, blanch the kernels from them, add 
them to the preserve about five minutes before it is 
done. 

Apricot Preserve. 629. 

Pick the fruit when very ripB, split it open, and 
take out the stones ; weigh it, allowing f of a lb. of 
sugar to every 1 lb. of fruit. Lay the apricots flat 
on a dish, letting the skin be nearest the dish ; cover 
them with part of the sugar, which must be finely 
broken ; leave them for some hours, until the juice 
begins to run from them. Put them into a preserv-

kernels, and add them to the preserve wlien it is half 
boiled, or after it has been skimmed clear. 

Apricot Cheese. 630. 

Put some apricots without their stones into a 
stone jar, set it in a pan of water over the fire ; 
when quite soft, press them through a hair or fine 
wire sieve. Weigh the pulp, allow f of a lb. of 
loaf sugar to every lb. of pulp. Put both on the 
fire together ; boil well for half to three-quarters of 
an hour ; put into small moulds. Some blanched 
kernels can be added to this if liked. 

To Dry Apricots. 631. 

The fruit should be well grown but not over ripe. 
Divide the apricots in halves, remove the stones ; 
weigh the fruit, allow equal weight of sugar. Place 
the apricots on a dish singly, cover them with part 
of the pounded sugar, leave them tT^enty-four hours. 
Take the juice from the fruit, the remainder of the 
sugar, some of the kernels blanched, and water, 
allowing it in proportion of a |^ of a pint to every 
lb. of sugar. Boil this gently ten minutes, put in 
the apricots and boil two minutes. Put them into 
a clean dish with the syrup, and leave them for two 
days, then boil the syrup again and pour it over the 
fruit. The next day again boil the syrup ten 
minutes, put in the apricots and boil very gently 
four or five minutes, or until they are clear. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours in the syrup, then 
spread them on dishes to dry] with muslin over to 
keep off the flies. They will dry best in a green- 
house, but if that is not handy the sun may answer, 
or a very cool brick oven. When they are partly 
dry, join the halves together, and sprinkle the 
upper side with crystallized sugar. In two or three 
days turn them over and sprinkle the other side. 
Store them in tins, withi layers oi "^^"^^t "V^^t^een.

Chebbt Pbesebve. 632. 

To each lb. of fruit after it is stoned allow f of 
a lb. of loaf sugar. To every lb. of sugar put a y 
of a pint of water, boil the sugar and water to- 
gether for ten minutes, then add the fruit ; boil 
fast for twenty minutes, or till it begins to jelly. 

To Bottle Stone or Ripe Fruit. 633. 

Fill wide-necked bottles full of fruit, and in each 
bottle put 2 table-spoonfuls of powdered loaf sugar. 
Tie a piece of wet bladder over each bottle. The 
bladder must be tied very tight, but it must be left 
larger than the top of the bottle, or it will burst 
while the fruit is boiling. Place the bottles in a 
large fish-kettle of cold water, putting hay between 
to keep them tight. Let them come slowly to the 
boil, and then boil for ten minutes or a qimrter of 
an hour. Take the kettle off the fire, but let the 
bottles remain in it until they are quite cold. 

To Bottle Green Gooseberries. 634. 

Fill wide-necked bottles with small green goose- 
berries, fill them with spring water that has been 
boiled, but has been allowed to become cold. Cover 
the tops with bladder, tied on as in the last recipe. 
Boil in the same way, allowing the bottles to remain 
in the pan of water after boiling until they are cold. 
If these are kept perfectly air-tight and in a dry 
place, they will keep good many months. Sugar 
must of course be added when they are cooked. 

Green Gooseberry Cheese. 636. 

Stew the gooseberries till tender in a jar in the 
oven, or set the jar in a kettle of water. Then rub 
the pulp through a hair sieve. To every lb. of pulp 
allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar ; boil together for | an 
hour. Put into small jars.

Take the quinces when quite ripe, pare, core, and 
cut them into small pieces. Put them into a jar, 
cover them with the parings, half fill the jar with 
cold spidng water; leave them in a hot oven for 
some hours. When quite soft take out the peel and 
press the fruit through a sieve. Weigh the pulp, 
allow the same in loaf sugar. Put the sugar on the 
fire with just enough water to dissolve it, boil for 
fifteen minutes and skim ; then add the quince, boil 
gently for three-quarters of an hour. Stir con- 
stantly or it will bum. Put into small jars, and 
cover them. 

Orange Brandy. 637. 

2 dozen Seville oranges, free from specks, 2 gal- 
lons of French brandy. Put the oranges and brandy 
into a deep pan, the brandy must cover the oranges, 
the pan must have a tight-fitting lid, and be kept 
perfectly air-tight. The top layer of oranges must 
bo turned every fourth day. In a month the oranges 
will become hard ; the Drandy is then fit to be 
bottled. As it is drawn off, 1 lb. of refined loaf 
sugar must be added to every quart of brandy. 
Orange gin can be made the same way.

Peel the rind of 12 Seville oranges very thin, pour 
over it 2 quarts of brandy, let it stand three days, 
then boil 1 gill of water with 1 j lb. of loaf sugar 
for fifteen minutes, skim well and add it to the 
brandy. Next heat a gill of new milk, add it to the 
above ; cover over, and leave for three more days.

of sifted sugar, 2 oz. of citron cut in thin pieces, 
2 oz. of preserved cherries, 2 oz. of dried apricots 
cut in pieces. Mix all well together, put it into a 
freezing mould, set it in ice and salt; stir till it 
begins to congeal. Stir it well round once or twice, 
then put it into the mould it is to be turned out of 
after; if too thick, add a little more cream. Put 
writing-paper over the top, cover it close ; set it in 
the ice till well frozen. When to be turned out, put 
a warm cloth for a moment round the mould ; or 
even dipping the mould into water just warm may 
answer. 

Raspberry Ice. 653. 

To a pint of cream put \ a lb. of raspberry juice 
or jelly, and a little sifted sugar, about a |^ of a lb. 
Mix well, rub through a sieve ; add a little 
cochineal. A little brandy, or vanilla, is also an 
improvement, as the raspbema^ ^<Ci tl^H» ^Sic=?R^is^'^

give flavour enough. Any other jam can be used 
instead of raspberry. Put it into the freezing 
mould. Cover tight, and put ice and salt well round 
and over it. Some use half milk and half cream ; 
in which case it must be well stirred until it is 
partly frozen, or the milk and cream will not mix 
properly. 

G-iNGEB Ice. 654. 

Half a pint of cream, ^ a pint of good milk, 2 oz. 
of sifted sugar, ^ lb. preserved ginger cut into 
pieces, and enough of the juice to flavour the 
cream. The yolk of 1 or 2 eggs can be first boiled 
in the milk and allowed to get cold ; it improves 
the colour. Ice, as in the other recipes. 

Ginger Toffee. 655. 

2 oz. of ground ginger, 1 lb. of sugar, 1 oz. of 
butter ; add enough water to melt the sugar. Boil 
ten minutes. Four on to a dish wet with cold 
water. 

Eyerton Toffee. 656. 

Take f of a lb. of moist sugar, J of a lb. of butter. 
Melt the butter in a clean saucepan ; add the sugar, 
which must be good brown soft sugar; boil till the 
toffee begins to get crisp when dropped into a cup 
of cold water; then add the juice of -J- a lemon 
strained from the pips, or f a teaspoonful of essence 
of lemon. Pour on to a greased tin, leave to get 
cold, then break up into pieces. Almonds blanched 
and cut in strips can be added with the lemon. 
TofEee must be stirred all the time it is boiling, as 
it soon bums. 

Chocolate Toffee. 657. 

6 oz. of butter, 12 oz. of brown sugar, ^ an oz. of 

chocolate scraped into ipo^dftT, 1 table-spoonful of 

treacle, vanilla to fLavour («i\iOT3L\i \ \.^^«^<5>^T&^iS. ^^j:^^

before taking it off the fii^e). Mix the chocolate in a 
teacup with cold milk till smooth, then fill up the 
cup with milk. Add all the other things; mix 
well, put it on the fire, boil for ten minutes ; keep 
stirring all the time, as it very easily bums. Pour 
out on a buttered tin to cool. This toffee should not 
be crisp, but just hard enough to break up into 
pieces like chocolate. It is much eaten in India 
being served with other sweetmeats at dessert or 
afternoon teas. 

CocoANUT Ice. 658. 

Get 1 large, or 2 small cocoanuts, take out the 
milk carefully, strain it through a piece of muslin | 
break the shell of the cocoanut, and grate all the 
white part fine. Put it into a lined saucepan, with 
the milk and 2 lbs. of sifted sugar ; boil half an hour 
over a slow fire ; after, let it cool for three minutes 
Stir it all the time. Spread it on a wet board or 
dish about one inch thick. Add vanilla, lemon, or 
almond flavouring if liked. If wished for pink, turn 
half the white on to the board ; add a teaspoonf ul 
of cochineal to that in the pan. Stir over the fire 
till mixed, then turn out on to the board. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES. 



Leg of Mutton R^chauff^. 659. 

A ROAST leg of mutton may be nicely warmed a 
second time, if only a few slices have been cut out 
of it the first day ; mash some potatoes well and 
smooth, fill up the hole in the leg with them, making 
it even with the meat and smooth ; put a little 
flripping on the other part of the leg, and put it in 
the oven for about an hour ; or till it is hot, and 
the potatoes brown. Serve with gravy round. 

Haricot Mutton. 660. 

Take the best end or middle of a neck of mutton, 
cut into neat chops, cut the bones rather short, and 
take off any fat and bits of skin. Put 2 oz. of 
butter into a saucepan big enough to hold the 
mutton, let it get hot, add some pieces of onion cut 
in slices, and put in the chops ; let them all get 
well browned, keeping a lid on the pan, but looking 
at it frequently to see it does not bum. When all 
is nicely brown, put in a pint of stock, some carrots, 
turnips, and celery, cut into neat pieces, and let all 
simmer together for one hour and a half to two hours. 
The chops will take three-quarters of an hour to 
brown before the stock is added. Serve with the 
chops round, the vegetables in the middle. The 
gravy should be thickened with cornflour. 

Tomato Pie. 661. 

Butter a pie-dish, and cover with bread crumbs, 
then put a layer of tMn coV^ tcv^«i\), It^^ I^^^tscl «kin ; 



HENU COOKERY BOOK. 233 

add pepper and salt, next a layer of sliced tomatoes, 
then bread crumbs; repeat till the dish is full, 
having bread crumbs at the top. Put in a little 
stock ; bake until nicely browned at the top, and 
the tomatoes have had time to cook. About an 
hour in a moderate oven. 

Potato Pie. 662. 

Take any pieces of cold meat, and potatoes that 
have been left from the day before. Cut the meat 
neatly, put a layer of meat into a pie-dish, and a 
layer of cold potatoes, add pepper and salt ; fill up 
your dish with layers of these ; add enough stock to 
moisten it well. Have ready some nicely mashed 
potatoes ; put a thick layer of them over all, smooth 
them down neatly, and cross-bar them with a knife 
at the top, like large dice ; put it in the oven for 
three-quarters of an hour, or till it is brown. The 
thin end of a neck of mutton does nicely for this ; 
only in that case uncooked potatoes can be used, 
and a little onion added if liked ; put a tin plate 
over it first, allowing it to stew gently in a moderate 
oven for nearly two hours ; about twenty minutes 
before serving, take off the plate, put more stock in 
if necessary ; put on the layer of mashed potatoes, 
and brown in the oven. 

Potato Pie (Lancashiee Dish). 663. 

Take some nice tender uncooked beef, cut up 
into neat pieces, put a layer of it in a big pie-dish, 
then slices of raw potatoes, add pepper, salt, and 
small slices of onion ; fill up the dish quite full (the 
pieces of beef can be floured a little) ; pour in as 
much water or weak broth as it will hold ; cover 
the whole with a good thick crust made with beef 
dripping, or beef suet is liked better by some. Fat 
may be put in with the meat \i \\V^^. "^"^^ ^^t'soi.

two to three hours in a moderate oven. A brick 
oven is best, as it bakes more regularly. 

To Make Soy. 664. 

1 lb. of salt, 2 lb. common sugar, stir in a frying- 
pan for half an hour over a slow fire ; add to this 3 
pints of boiling water, a few spoonfuls of essence

simmer, put in a large cupful of coarse brown 
sugar and a pint of sherry. 

Fried Lamb's Liver. 666. 

Have it quite fresh, wash and wipe it ; cut the 
liver in slices, not quite ^ an inch thick ; flour it 
well, put it in the frying-pan with a little dripping, 
fry gently till it is brown on both sides, season 
when half fried with salt and pepper. Put it on to 
a hot dish, keep it warm ; cut up some small square 
pieces of bread, fry them crisp. Place the liver on 
the dish with the bread in the centre, and pour 
round all some good brown gravy. Liver may also 
be half boiled, then stewed in good thick gravy, add 
^ a glass of port wine, and garnish with cut lemon ; 
or it can be minced. 

Bengal Chutney. 667. 

1 lb. brown sugar, ^ lb. salt, 2 oz. garlic, 6 oz.

Good Clear Beef Tea. 668. 

Take 4 lbs. of beef cut very thin, then put it in a 
bi*own jar with a cover on it, put a sheet of paper 
over, then a paste of flour, and a cloth tied over all. 
Set the jar in a saucepan of water up to the neck, 
let it simmer nine hours, then strain through a fine 
sieve. It will be as clear as jelly, and keep for days 
in a cool place. Very strong. 

Strengthekikg Food for Invalids. 669. 

7 eggs, 8 lemons ; squeeze the juice of the lemons 
on the eggs (shells as well), sha^e them about for 
twenty-four hours, then open the eggs, and let out 
yolk and white ; whip them well up together with 
a fork, pass all through a small tin strainer, add 3 
oz. of sifted sugar, f a pint of brandy. Mix all well, 
and bottle tight. Take 2 large table-spoonfuls when 
wanted. Shake the bottle first. When for sickness, 
give a teaspoonful as slowly as possible. 

Brandy and Egg Mixture. 670. 

Take the whites and yolks of 3 eggs, beat them 
up with a 1^ of a pint of water. Add slowly 2 table- 
spoonfuls of brandy, with a little loaf sugar, and 
nutmeg if liked. Give 1 to 2 table-spoonfuls every 
four to six hours.

proportions given in these two last recipes are for a 
child, and quantities can be doubled for an adult. 

Good Pobt Wine Jelly. 672. 

Steep 2 oz. isinglass, f an oz. gum arabic, in a 
pint of port wine all night. Next morning put into 
a saucepan 2 oz. brown sugar candj ; add the wine, 
and a little grated nutmeg. Simmer slowly until 
quite dissolved ; strain through a piece of muslin. 
Use cold. 

Stbengthening Jelly. 673. 

2 oz. best isinglass, 2 oz. gum arabic, 2 oz. sugar 
candy, with a bottle of port or sherry. Put all to- 
gether into a jar, cover it close, and put it into a 
stewpan of boiling water by the side of the fire till 
dissolved. These two recipes are nearly alike, but 
the latter is the better way of making it. 

Egg Jelly. 674. 

Half an oz. of ^N'elson's gelatine soaked in a ^ 
of a pint of water for two hours. Boil a |^ of a pint 
of water and pour it on to the gelatine quite boiling. 
Take 2 lemons, 3 eggs, | lb. loaf sugar, 1 glass of 
sherry. Rub the rind off the lemons with a few 
lumps of sugar, and squeeze the juice of the lemons 
over all the sugar ; then put in the gelatine, the 
eggs well beaten, and the wine. Stir all well, and 
put into a mould previously dipped in cold water. 

HoMCEOPATHic Beef Tea. 676. 

1 lb. of perfectly fresh beef, free from all fat, 
minced very fine, or put once through the mincing 
machine, a very small pinch of salt, 1| pint of cold 
soft water. Put into a saucepan, simmer till it 

conies to a boiling point, then boil quickly for fifteen 

minntea and strain for use. 



menu cookery book. 237 

Egg and Savoury Jelly. 676. 

Take a calf's foot, 2 lbs. of lean beef, cnt in small 
pieces, a bnncli of sweet herbs, a carrot and turnip, 
salt, pepper, and a small onion ; pour on to it 3 pints 
of cold water, let it simmer, after it has come to the 
boil, till the bones drop ont of the foot and till it is 
reduced to half ; strain and leave till cold ; it should 
be quite a jelly ; if not, a little isinglass or gelatine 
may be added ; take off all the fat, melt it, and add 
to it the whites of 2 eggs well beaten, a little white 
wine, and any ketchup, if liked ; stir the eggs and 
the shells well in, let it boil, then pass through a 
jelly bag. Boil 2 eggs hard, cut the white into neat 
pieces, and rub the yolks through a sieve. Let the 
jelly get nearly cold, then put about an inch in 
depth into a mould which has been in cold water ; 
when that has set, put the pieces of white of egg 
round and sprinkle the yolk in the centre ; pour in 
the rest of the jelly gently, let it get cold, turn out. 
If the jelly is clear, this looks tempting, and will 
often induce an invalid to eat some. 

Pickle for Herrings, Sprats, etc. 677. 

Cut 2 small onions in thin slices. Mix with salt, 
pepper, a little mixed spice, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Add to it | a pint of vinegar, and |- of a 
pint of water. Clean the fish, cut off the fins and 
gills. Some prefer to cut them open, take out the 
back bone, cut off the head, and roll them up, be- 
ginning from the thick end. Put the fish into a 
deep dish, pour all the mixture over, and bake, in a 
very slow oven for two or more hours. A bay-leaf 
or two may be added, and the onion omitted.

with 2 gallons of water. Skim well when it begins 
to boil ; let it boil well for a quarter of an honr, 
leave till quite cold, pour over the beef. This will 
keep good some time, and in cold weather will do, if 
boiled up, for a second piece of beef, with a little 
more salt added. Ox tongues are very good cured 
in this for three weeks. 



To Preserve Egos. 679. 

Put into a deep pan 4 quarts of quick-lime, f a lb. 
of salt, 1 oz. of cream of tartar. Pour on to this 
from 1| to 2 gallons of cold water ; stir it well, and 
leave till the next day. Pour the water gently off, 
so as not to disturb the lime; put in your eggs, 
which should be quite fresh and not cracked at all. 
Pour the water gently over them again. The eggs 
must be quite covered. Eggs may be put down in 
May, and will be quite good in December. This 
quantity should preserve nearly 100 eggs, I have 
used this recipe for years, and seldom fold a bad egg 
amongst them. I have kept them from May to the 
end of January. The water will sink during the 
time ; more must be added ; boil it, allow it to go 
cold, mix a little salt into it, and fill up your pan. 
The eggs must always be under the water. 

Pickled Onions. 680. 

Peel some quite small onions, put them into some 
cold water with a little salt, and let them stand all 
night. Boil as much vinegar as will cover the 
onions well, adding to it peppercorns, mustard-seed, 
a little horseradish, and a spoonful of brown sugar ; 
allow it to get cold. Put the onions in a jar, pour 
the mixture over. Cover down tight. They will 
be £t for use in three m.oiitlia.

Store Sauce. 681. 

2 wineglasses of port wine, 2 of walnut ketchnp, 
4 of musliroom ditto, 2 essence of anchovy, 1 table- 
spoonful of browning, 6 shallots, sliced and pounded, 
^ a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. Simmer all to- 
gether for fifteen minutes, bottle, cork, and seal to 
keep the air out. 

Green Qoosbberrt Sauce. 682. 

Stew green gooseberries in a stone jar, in a hot 
oven, till they will pulp. Rub through a sieve ; 
take a pint of the pulp, add to it a little cream, a 
few spoonfuls of sugar, enough to sweeten it, but it 
should be allowed to be rather acid, beat 1 egg well, 
add this with 1 oz. of butter, warm all together over 
the fire, and pour round a boiled leg of lamb. If 
too thick, a little more cream can be mixed in. 

To Cure Bacon. 683. 

Weigh the flitch, and to every 20 lbs. take l^ lb. 
of salt, 1|- lb. of brown sugar, and 3 oz. of salt- 
petre. Mix well together, and place near the fire 
till quite hot. Rub a small quantity of this on the 
skin side, and lay the flitch on a slab, where the 
brine can run off, having first strewed some of the 
salt, etc., on the slab. Lay the rest on the flesh 
side, putting the most where the flitch is the 
thickest, press it gently with the hand to keep it 
on. When the flitch is half cured, put on to it a 
1^ of a lb. of common salt to each 20 lb. of bacon. 
A flitch of 40 lb. will take three weeks to cure. 
Wipe off the salt, and hang to dry. 

To Cure Hams. 684.

brown sugar, f lb. of salt, and 2 oz. of aalt^tc^. Mxs.^

bacon. The ham must be in a shallow tub or deep 
dish, so that the liquor cannot get away. As soon 
as it begins to run from the ham, it must be basted 
with it at least three times a day. Strew a handful 
of salt oyer it when it has been half, the time in 
pickle. A ham of 20 lb. should be in salt a month. 
Dry, and hang as the bacon. 

Good Stock for Making Soup. 686. 

Take a knuckle of yeal, a small quantity of lean 
ham, or a ham bone with some meat left on it, a 
couple of old fowls, and any pieces of game which 
are not wanted. Cut them all up, and break up 
the bones ; put them into a large pot with 2 quarts 
of water, stew for half an hour. Add some pepper- 
corns, salt, a blade or two of mace, and some all- 
spice ; pour on 4 quarts more water, or weak beef 
broth. Boil till the meat is tender. Strain, and 
let it stand till next day. This will make a good 
foundation for soups. Brown soup can be coloured 
with a small quantity of colouring, and cleared with 
the white and shell of an egg. A second boiling of 
this stock with more water will make a foundation 
for any vegetable or pea soup. 

Soup for the Poor. 686. 

Put 18 gallons of cold water into" a clean boiler, 
with 6 lb. of lean beef cut into pieces, and an ox 
cheek, also partly broken up. Let this simmer 
gently for five hours, but not boil; put 14 lb. of 
whole-dried peas, good boilers, into cold water to 
soak all night. Take 6 turnips, 7 onions, 9 carrots^ 
and some celery ; cut them all up into small pieces, 
and let them stand in cold water all night. Put 
the peas, and all the vegetables, into the boiler to 
the meat, about four To-ouxa \ietare the soup is re-

Mix 1^ lb. of oatmeal and 1 oz. of mustard very 
smoothly in cold water, add them to the soup, with 
1 lb. of dripping, 1 oz. of pepper, and IJ or more of 
salt. Boil all quickly for one hour, and stir con- 
stantly. The soup must be well stirred from the 
bottom all the time it is being given out, or all the 
best part is left. If rice or pearl barley is preferred 
to oatmeal, it must be well soaked, and put in with 
the vegetables. This soup was sold at a Id. a quart 
for many winters, in some places where the men 
were out of work. 

Arrowroot Mould. 687. 

Take a j of a lb. of arrowroot, beat it up smooth 
with milk until it is the thickness of cream, then 
pour on to it 3 gills of boiling milk, stirring all the 
time ; add flavouring and sugar to taste. If it tastes 
rough after mixing, it is better to boil it. Put into 
a mould, and turn out when cold. It can be eaten 
with cream or syrup, and is light for an invalid. 

Milk Arrowroot. 688. 

Take a dessert-spoonful of the best arrowroot, mix 
it very smooth with a little milk, then pour on ^ a 
pint of quite boiling milk, stirring all the time. 
Sugar can be added if liked, and 2 teaspoonfuls of 
brandy. This is very good for an invalid. 

Milk Cornflour. 689. 

Put 2 dessert-spoonfuls of cornflour, and mix as 
above, only this is better boiled. It may also be 
made with water instead of milk, and wine or brandy 
added.

with ^ a pint of water, let it simmer over the fire 
until it thickens ; spice, sugar, or brandy cwa. \\^

Poor Man's Jam. 691. 

Pick blackberries wben qtiite ripe, in dry weather, 
free from stalks. Allow to every pound of fruit J a 
lb. of loaf sugar. Boil for three-quarters of an hour, 
stirring and skimming well. Put into jars and cover. 
Keep in a dry place. This will be found to be 
cheaper than butter or lard, to eat with bread. It 
is . very wholesome. It also makei^ good rolled 
puddings. 

To Pickle Walnuts. 692. 

Pick them in June or July, when a needle will go 
easily through them. Put them into a strong brine 
of salt and water ; they must be pricked in half a 
dozen places first. Leave them in the brine about 
four to six days, drain them on hair sieves, and leave 
them in the sun until they are quite black. This 
will take two or three days ; they must be brought 
in at night. Put them into stone jars, take what 
quantity of good vinegar you require to cover them, 
boil it with mustard seed, peppercorns, cloves, and 
a little allspice. When cold, cover the walnuts with 
it. Fasten the jars down quite air-tight, and keep 
for six or eight months before using. The pickle 
should be looked at once or twice ; if it has got dry, 
more boiled vinegar should be added, only be careful 
it is cold before being added. 

Fried Bread-Crumbs. 693. 

Dry pieces of broken bread in the oven when it 
is cool, rub them through an open tin sieve, or pound 
them. Put them into a jar or bottle, well fastened 
down, and keep for use. These do for all common 
purposes.

to become cold. Remove the dripping from the top ; 
all the thick paH will have gone to the bottom of 
the pan. 

Herrings' Roes. 695. 

Take the soft roes from fresh herrings or bloaters, 
put them into a small saucepan with a little butter, 
white pepper, and cayenne ; they must be made very 
hot, but not allowed to dry. Have some squares 
or fingers of toast well buttered, and lightly spread 
with anchovy paste. Spread the roes on very hot 
and thickly over each piece, and serve at once on cut 
paper. 

Tomato Savoury. 696. 

Take some round pieces of toast, butter them, put 
on anchovy paste, cover this with half a roasted 
tomato, on the top of this place a nicely-poached 
egg, and serve. Salt and cayenne must be sprinkled 
over the tomatoes.
