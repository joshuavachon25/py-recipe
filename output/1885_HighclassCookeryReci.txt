This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

PREFACE. 



The ** Recipes for Plain Cookery/' published 
about a year ago, written in a simple and ooncise 
form, have been so kindly received by our Stu- 
dents and the Public, that I now offer some of our 
High-Class Becipes, written in the same style, and 
hope they will give satisfaction, at all events to 
our Pupils. I have written these somewhat hastily 
during an extra pressure of work entailed by the 
Inventions Exhibition ; and must^ therefore, ask 
forgiveness if, in some cases, the recipes are 
not as neatly worded as they should be. The 
recipes themselves I believe to be correct, and 
that is the great point. I have adopted the 
present style, hoping to avoid the fault of most 
Qookery books, namely, that you must be a good 
cook before you can cook satisfactorily from the 
instructions given, which, in quantities at least, 
leave a great deal to the imagination. From 
time to time I hope to add to these Becipes, as 
** new dishes " suggest themselves, and are taught 
in the School. 

EDITH OLABKE, 

Lady Superintendent, 
28rd JuM 1SS5. 



*,* By an unfortwiate overnght a fount of type whieh did not 
ctdmit of the insertion of the usual accents wax selected for the 
headings to t^e recipes ; ea^h iriU, however, he found properly 
accented in the Index. 



NOTE. 



To insure good frying, the heat of the fat should 
be tested by a fryometer, which must show the 
heat for whitebait to be not less than 400^ ; 
for fish, from 860^ to 875''; and for meat, from 
875'' to 880^ If oil is used it must be much 
hotter than fat or lard.

saucepan, with plenty of fast-boiling water, slightly 
salted, and let it boil until tender ; it will take 
from fifteen to twenty minutes. If it turns over 
in the water, as it is apt to do, it must be turned 
back again with a fork, for the flowers keep whiter 
well under the water. Care must be taken to 
remove any scum that rises. When the centre of 
the flower yields to pressure, it is done. Take it 
up carefully with a slice, and drain it over a sieve. 
But while it was boiling, the sauce should have 
been made. 

Two ounces of grated Parmesan cheese, half an 
ounce of butter, one ounce of flour^ a gill of cold 
water, a tablespoonful of cream, and as much 
cayenne pepper as would cover the flat surface of 
a split pea. Put the butter and flour into a small 
stewpan, and mix them thoroughly, off" the fire ; 
with the back of a wooden spoon add a gill of 
cold water, and stir the sauce over the fire till it 
is thick and quite smooth, then add the cream, 
the cayenne, and a pinch of salt. 

When the cauliflower is done enough, take it up, 
place it on the dish in which it is to be served, 
and squeeze it gently together in a clean cloth, 
held with both hands. Stir half the cheese into 
the sauce, and then pour the sauce gently all over 
the flower ; sprinkle the remainder of the cheese 
over the top, and brown it as maccaroni is browned. 
Serve it very hot.

arranged that the proportions of oven or fire or boiler room can be varied to suit 
the requirements of the establishment.
