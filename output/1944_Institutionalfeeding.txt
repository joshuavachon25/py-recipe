THE LUNCK SPECIAL 

Millions of war vjorkers know that a well-planned lunch special is the 
best food buy for their money. 

Food operators should recognise the lunch special as the best means of 
serving nutritious food to the war worker; certainly the surest method of 
getting to the worker one third of his daily food requirements. The food 
operator has numerous other advantages to gain. The advantages to both food 
operator and worker are greatest when a majority of the plant's vjorkers choose 
the lunch special. 

Advantages to the Food Op erator : 

1. VJorker satisfaction is greater when an appetizing meal is served. 
It is one of the best ways to foster good will. 

2« Service is faster because the worker selects the menu as a whole 
instead of by individual items. The server can dish up food con- 
tinuously without waiting for the customer's selection. The most 
rapid service can be obtained when one or more serving counters 
are used exclusively' for the lunch special. 

3. Man - hours are c ons erve d when foods for a simple m.enu are prepared, 
rather, than numerous items for a selective menu. 

^* Food wast e i s' le ovsened because the number of workers selecting 
the lunch 'special can be anticipated, and the correct amounts of 
food prepared. 

5, Abuniant f oods may be used advanta geously in considerable quantity. 
To use abundant foods wisely is a part of wartime food conservation. 

Advantages t o the Worker : . ' , ' 



1, His "planned"' neal may be obtained quickly without long standing in 
line, 'thus leaving time for leisurely eating and for relayaticn. 

2, The lunch special miakes, it -easy for the worker to select a well- 
balanced nutritious meal. 

3, He spends money wisely because he gets a maximum of good, nutritious 
food at minimum cost. , 

A» He takes out "health insurance" in the form of good nutrition.

Plann ing the Lunch Special 



The lunch special is defeated at the outset if it is olanned around 
leftovers. The food should be fresh, appetizing , colorful and satisfying, 
pla.iined to meet the nutritional needs of the v;orker. 

Selling the Lunch Spe cial 

Plants X'l'nlch have greatest success with the lunch special have backed 
it with clever merchandising. To offer good food is not enoijgh. Uays to 
"sell''' the lunch to the worker should be devised. The key to the success of 
the program is vorker participation. 



A Victory Vitamin lunch should be offered in place of or in addition to 
regul&r a la carte items, We recommend that the lunch plate consist of a choice 
of t\-.o entrees with two vegetables, a beverage, bread and butter, and a dessert, 
U3ua..;.]y, this special' plate, because of economies effected, is offered at an 
attractive price. 

To aid this, the War Food Administration has a campaign program worked 
out that can be adapted to any plant. It is designed to increase the employeetg 
interest in proper food selection and is available upon request.

August, 1944 



I NSTI TUTIONAL' FOOD SERVICE 



The all-American f ruit-of-the-month will undoubtedly be peaches. This year's 
crop. is the third largest on record. The pear crop is good; Cantaloups are 
plentiful* 

With victory gardens now yielding, tomatoes are plentiful. Tomatoes are second 
only to citrus fruit as a source of Vitamin C« Three and one-half ounces of raw 
tomatoes provide one- third our daily requirement of this vitamin. Use tomatoes 
liberally in salads and sandwiches. They add color, variety, and eye appeal to 
assorted cold plates. 

Relative food value : Cantaloups are about half as rich, per pound, in Vitamin C 
as citrus fruits and tomatoes^ Peaches hrve less than half the Vitamin C content 
provided by cantaloups. However, these two fruits can contribute a goodly share 
of carotene, or pro-Vitamin A, to the diet. 

Remember — mature, ripe tomatoes lose very little Vitamin Q in cooking, especially 
if stainless steel, plastic, or glass equipment is used, Iron pots and pans 
or steel knives and strainers that will rust destroy some of the food value. Eve: 
full-grown green tomatoes contain a good portion of the Vitamin C found in the 
vine-ripened fruit. The late winter tomatoes found in the stores from January, to 
May may contain only one-fourth the Vitamin C found in the summer-grown, sun- 
ripened tomatoes. This is- a good reason to use fresh tomatoes in season. 

How to buy ; Freshly picked fruits have highest nutritive value. Choose fruit 
that is free from injury, disease or decay, and not over-ripe. This year fresh 
peaches for table use have been placed under price ceilings. For better quality, 
buy peaches by grade. Government standards for the fancy grade require that they 
should be mature, well formed, with good color characteristic of the variety. 

For full-me a ted, fine-flavored cantaloups, choose them heavy for their size, well 
formed, and heavily netted (if they are the netted variety), with light golden- 
yellow beneath the nettingo Sweet, musk-like fragrance indicates ripeness. So 
does the suppleness of the blossom cut end when it is lightly pressed© The very 
best cantaloups for eating are vine-ripened. Usually this quality is stamped 
"vine-ripened" on the crate. When melons are bought in case lots, sort them 
immediately for ripeness, chill the ripest first for use and ripen the green ones 
at approximately 60° F. , turning them as they ripen.

How t o store; All fruit should "be stored at approximately 40° F. to preserve an 
optimum amount of the Vitamin Co Fresh or canned acid fruits (citrus and toma- 
toes) retain their Vitamin C "better than do non-acid fruits; therefore, neither 
peaches nor cantaloups should "be held in storage as long as the citrus fruit s. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR SERVING- 



Tomatoes 

Serve cold, stuffed with chicken salad, 
cabbage slaw, or egg and celery salad, 

Stuff with a mixture of chopped tomato 
pulp, a little green pepper, a touch of 
onion, and "buttered "bread crumbs. Bake 
in hot oven 10 to 15 minutes. 

Broiled or baked halves, sprinkled with 
salt and ground cheese in 400 Q . oven CO.. 
until cheese is melted, make an appe- 
tising garnish for a vegetable plate. 

Combine tomato wedges with raw green 
and yellow vegetables such as endive, 
carrot slivers, leaf lettuce, raw spin- 
ach in salad bowl c. Marinate with -/ 
French dressing? ■ Serve very cold, 

Try a vegetable plate featuring a 
sandwich of tomato slices, spread with 
cream cheese' and a little chopped olive* 
Combine this with ha.rl.- cooked egg 
halves, cabbage, and sour pickle salado- 

Serve cold tomato juice for breakfast, 
lunch or dinner, and as a between-meal 
pick-me-up » It is rich in Vitamin C, 
so likely. to be lacking in many workers' 
diets. '" '' 

Those late summer, ■ not-quit e-ripe ' 
tomatoes are delicious if' sliced and 
dipped in egg and fine crumbs and 
fried. They add flavor and variety 
to the mealo ' .... 

Chopped green tomatoes are excellent ■ 
in pickles or fried in cream. 



Cantaloups and Peaches 

Prepare sliced peaches just before 
serving. If you must peel them ahead of 
time, prevent discoloration by leaving 
them whole and covered in a solution of 
lemon juice and water, or pineapple 
juice mixed with other fruit juices. 

Fill hollow of cantaloups with fresh 
berries or seeded cherries for lunch or 
: ,dinner dessert. Flavor is enhanced when 
"a little sugar or honey and a few drops 
of; lemon or lime juice are added, just 
before serving. 

Make a fresh fruit plate by serving 
peeled sliced cantaloup with cubes of 
watermelon and slices or halves of fresh 
peaches. Turn this into a salad plate 
by serving. on lettuce and garnishing 
peaches with a mound of cottage cheese. 

Jf you must save time in preparation, 
combine canned pineapple or pears with, 
fresh melon and pepch slices. Add lime- 
or lemon juice for flavor, fresh mint 
for color and for appetite tempter. 

Cook fresh peaches arid serve them plain 
or topped with a, flaky crust for peach 
cobbler; serve raw or cooked peaches'- 
over rich biscuit crust for peach short- 
cake. Don't neglect " the - ever-popular . ' 
peach pie-- a lattice top crust will save 
pastry and fat.

CEREAL DESSERTS 
(February \U, 1944) 



This v;ee'.: vje have for jour service - CERS-'\LS - in desserts. 
So much has been said about the us3 of cereals and vjhole grains 
in the diet, that vje are follovjing thrcagh in this release vgith 
furthier suggestions. 

Cereals and ;\;^hole grains have proved their vjorth as meat 
extenders, '.'hy not try thera in DESSEliTS? Such a dessert is 
substantial and gives body to a soup and salad neal that many 
choose. Somo restaurants throughout the country have featured 
cereal dishes and found them to be very successful. . 



They are easy to prepare, inexpensive and are a satisfying 
finish to a meal. These desserts '.iill maintain eye and taste 
apocal \.ihen it is necessary to keep them on a service table for 
any great length of tipie. 



Tlie most popular are oatmeal, rice, corn meal, and prepared 
cereals. Cereal desserts are also excellent means of using dry 
bread, such as bread custard pudding, bror;n betty pudding (using 
fruit as a base), cah.es and cookies. This is one v.'ay you can do 
your part in helping to avoid the high percentage of waste in bread 
and adding to the efficiency of operation. 



The:re is still a plentiful supply of IRISH PtJTATOES . Use 
them in soup, salad or the laain ciish.

mm TIPS. 



Excerpts from a VJashington letter prove valuable to all 
Industrial Feeding 'Managers, Restaurateurs, and Industrial 
Feeding Contractors in giving a clear picture of the meat situa- 
tion for the month of July and T,'Vhat to expect in the future in 
regard to the meat supply. 

The picture shovjs points re-established on choice cuts - 
leg, rib and loin of lamb and mutton. 

■-■■"-'-SM^^ MIMI— — 

In the beef group, the point value has bee| liaised, ori-^ /\ 
more ponular cuts of beef, v^hile others less in demands-are ■ Drn««.. 

point free. \ ^ RECiRD 

Veal is left point free because supplies are expected to *** 
increase about 2^% in Julj^. All pork cuts should be, ; cut , to meet..^ 
all demands at a zero point value. I 



3RieULTU»E I 



In view of tiiis ration story, 3^ou, as Manager, vjill be 
vjise to plan ahead, budget present ration points to meet emer- 
gencies and possible changes. An accurate check is essential. 
Then j^-ou know where jom stand. A ration point record system is 
a method found to be most' successful and used bjr one of the largest 
cafeterias in the Ba^.;^ Area — a system, isihereby a report is kept by 
checking withdrawals by pound and point from your food storage locker. 

Ifenus including point free meat will help stretch ration 
points and m.ake budgeting easier. 

NE7"^S FLASH! — Onions are in good supply in markets on the P-''cific 
Coast. For the next month or tvjo, we are asking the cooperation 
of all in helping to use the present onion supply to clear the 
market for the large crop coming up in August and September. 

Around the Bay Area, the largest supply is Red Flats, which 
are not good storage onions. In Los Angeles, there are Spanish 
S^1;eets and Yellow Onions, and the l7ashington Markets have a good 
supply of yellow and vjhite.

Quantity I\.e t ho ds for Serving Potatoes 

The Irish potato is one unrationed food that is popular, nutritious, and can 
be served in many vjays to give variety and satisfaction to vjartime meals. 

The potato has sometimes been taken for granted without due recognition of 
its importance to our vjell-being. It deserves to be featured on menus and 
used more often in soups, chovjders, salads, as a meat ejrtender, as ;;ell as 
with meat or meat alternates. 

Thanks to the American farmer, there will be plenty of potatoes this year for 
everyone who vjants to enjoy them once or twice daily. 

The stacks of potatoes in storage at the beginning of the year are ample to 
supply every possible demand until the new potato crop is available to pro- 
vide the great bulk of potatoes for market. Uo conceivable increase in ci- 
vilian consumption is likely to cause a repetition of the temporary potato 
famine that occurred in the spring of 19-43? although transportation difficul- 
ties might conceivably create localized shortages. 

The National Research Council, in suggesting a dietary pattern to furnish its 
recommended dietary allovjances, advises one or more servings of potatoes daily. 

Y'lhen carefully prepared, an average serving (one-third of a pound) of the Irish 
potato can provide as much as one-fifth of the daily requirement of ascorbic 
acid (vitamin C) as well as one-tenth of the daily requirement of iron. 

The vitamin C content of potatoes as served may vary widely because of storage 
and different methods of preparation. The mode of preparation is most import- 
ant, . . 

The best methods of cooking potatoes, listed in the order of their vitamin C 
retention, are: steaming \vhole unpeeled potatoes, baking in the skin, steaming 
without skin, and boiling. 

Preparation processes which increase vitamin C losses are long soaking of 
peeled or sectioned potatoes, dicing potatoes finely before cooking, mashing, 
and slicing, and holding cooked potatoes longer than half an hour before 
serving. 



Cooking losses of vitamin C: 

Steamed, nonpeeled 
Baked in skin 
Steajned vjithout skin 



very little loss 
about , 20 percent loss, 
about 50 percent losS' 



Holding losses of vitamin C (in addition to cooking losses)": 

Steamed, nonpeeled, held up to 1 hr. - little loss 
Baked in skin, held 1/2 hr. - 1$ - 20 percent loss

Sixnmering or cooking in \vater is another method of moist heat cookery. It 
is the method used in preparing stews and also in cooking i^rge cuts 
of less tender but well flavored meat» This method is usually called stewing 
and boiling. The term boiling is misleading, since better results are obtained 
from the standpoint of palatability and shrinkage if meat is cooked below the 
boiling point or 4t simmering temperature. This Is the ]»ethod, too, of pre- 
paring meat soup stocks for gravy and soup stock. 

Steps in Simmering Large Cuts 

1. Cover the meat entirely with water (hot or cold) to insure uniform cooking. 

2« Season with salt, pepper and herbs. Used wisely, herbs and spices improve 
the flavor of simmering meats. Various combinations of the following will 
give interesting results. Bay leaves, thyme, marjoram, parsley, green 
pepper, celery and onion tops, garlic, cloves, peppercorft and allspice; 
also tomatoes or tomato juice, chili sauce, catsup, and any vegetable 
juices on hand. 

3. Cover kettle closely and simmer only until tender. 



U' Vegetables may be cooked v^/ith the meat, adding them whole or in large 
pieces just in time for them to be done when the meat is tender. 

5. If the meat is to be served cold, let it cool, then chill in its own 
stock to retain flavor and help prevent undue shrinkage. 

Steps in Preparing a Stew - 

1. Cut boneless or unboned meat into uniform pieces. To avoid bone 
splinters, do not chop unboned meat with cleaver. 



2. Season meat with salt and pepper and if a brovm stew is desired, 
dredge with flour and brown meat on all sides in additional fat.

INSTITUTIONAL FOOD SERVICE 



FROZEN VEGETABLES ARE PLENTIFUL •' " 

War Food Administration's recent announcement states Frozen Vegetables and 

Frozen Baked Beans are listed among the foods in plentiful supply during September. 

Advantages of Using Frozen Vegetables 

An increasing number of food service managers are becoming aware of the 
advantages of using frozen vegetables. 

• labor-saving — aid in meeting manpower shortages. 

• save many hours of preparation, as the vegetables are cleaned 
and cut before they are frozen. 

. require less cooking time than- do fresh vegetables, and they 
provide a supply of such vegetables as green peas and ' : - ' •'• 
asparagus in months when these vegetables are not available 
in fresh form. . .. 

. nutritive value is about equal to that of the fresh -vegetables 
usually used %n institutional food service. : 

. the initial cost may, in gome cases, be higher than that of 
the fresh vegetables, the cost per serving may be no more be- 
cause of the reduced labor cost in preparation. 

Food Value 



Erozen baked beans a relatively new product .have about the same composition 

as canned or home-baked beans, and are a good source of protein, irbh, and- the B 
vitamins. 

Most vegetables are blanched before freezing and there is a slight vitamin 
loss in this process. The frozen product is apt to contain less Vitamin 0 than 
the fresh product when it is in its best condition. However, the ease with "which 
frozen vegetables can.be held in the frozen state until cocking, and the' short 
cooking time required for them, can compensate, at least in part, for 'the original 
processing loss. Other nutrients, except Vitamin 0, are almost the same in frozen 
vegetables as in fresh ones. 

Note Some of the large hospitals for the rehabilitation of returning Veterans 

are now using frozen vegetables in order to provide balanced diets while meeting- 
labor snortages. WAR F00D ADMINISTRATION OFFICE OF DISTRIBUTION

Victory Eo6'd Selection; >' 

* Onions h&ve been designated as a victory -food selection from 
September 21, to October 7-, The cooperation of all industrial f eeders, ■ food 
managers, institutions and restaurants is needed to help relieve the markets 
and storage 'facilities "by serving more onions during" the next three-week 
period, 

A Few Facts About Onions r — . * • 

,. And why you are being asked to* 'aid in distribution of this plentiful 
food. September 6 through October 7 is the actual production peak. Due to 
a large expan'sipn in production in the Western States this year, a critical 
shortage of storage space-is anticipated in th£se States. From scarcity to 
abundance ' is i today 's situat£ - 6n ,' r in the western region with a. plentiful supply 
of Sweet Spanish, onions available in all markets." The duality of this onion 
is good and they"' are suitable for commercial storing* Because of the large 
supply it is anticipated that prices ,.- particularly during harvest time will 
be attractive* ' : ' . ' "... 

Onions are a gourmet's delight for flavoring- the .more . bland dishes that have 
become popular during rationing. In, . many ' cases it"is>the flavoring that makes 
a particular dish a- success* 

Things to Know 

Food value is small but it counts! Onions contain a. small amount 
of vitamin C, thiamine and riboflavin and also small amounts of iron and 
calcium. 

In storing they should he well cured so that the neck tissue is completely dry. 

Put them in ventilated barrels, baskets, crates, or loosely woven bags 

Ventilation is essential.

Picny 01 you, r-e knoiT_, hav* received this 
inf oi-mation, but in resporjae to the nu- 
merous requests I'rora Caterers just recently 
aaded to our maiiin.fi' iie-.t, vje are repeating 
the stoi-y of Soy with menus and I'ccipes. 

By Popular Request — A repeat on Soybeans and their products: 



Study and experL-nents shov; Soybeans high in food value and inex- 
pensive to serve, n.akin^ thera a popular food for quantity feeding. 



Because of the high quality protein content and other food values 
found in this corsnon bean, they are successful as meat, alternates, ex- 
tenders, soup bases, main dishes, or as a vet^etable. In fact, they can 
be used from, j^ppetizers to dac^erts. 

VEGETABLE Soybean ... '."Jcsh the dried "vegetable" soybeans and soak 
for twelve hoursj tnen in the same x/ater cook until tender. Flavor them^ 
with m.eat, onions, tomatoes, or any comibination th.'s.t is good v;ith navy 
beans I Soybeans v.ill not coo!: up like ordinary beans but hold their 
shape and nut like texture •when done. 



TEHDERIZED SOYBEAN — Flakes and Grits — These Soybeans require 
only a fevj minutes to cook, '.'hole or crushed into flakes or grits, they 
make delicious casseroles and are good in meat loaves, patties and as 
meat e:<tenders, I-any restaurant people prefer using grits and flakes 
in m.eat loaves, rolls and patties since there is less shrinkage of the 
meat and it stays more i^oist, - an important itemi v;hen thinking in terms 
of the sales dollar and ration allotr:ents.

Page 2 - SCY^v - 



Grits added to bread, muffins and especially pancakes vdll 
bring favorable corariient from the customers. They are also tasty 
vjhen added to fish dishes, omelets or cookies, and also viith the 
breakfast oatmeal or vvheat cereal. 



THINGS TO R5:amSR ; 

Use about one fifth af^ much Soybeans as Leat 
v'hen adding as a meat extender. 

Grits and flakes blend better in bread, mjaffins, 
or meat dislies if an equal amount of toiling 
vjater is poured over them and allovjed to stand 
five minutes to soften. 

In cookies, leave the Grits crisp, gives a 

more nutlike flavor. 



SCY3SAM FLOUR — The easiest way of using Soybean Flour is to 
have on hand a mixture of Soybean and Vihite Flour, For convenience, 
add three pounds of Soybean Flour to eachi tvienty-four of VJliite Flour 
to have ready to use at ail times. 

Foods vjith Soyflour brown quickly. Soy products give a richer 
brov;n to baked foods and a crisper crust to sausage, fried miush and 
potato cakes. 

For a partial list of jobbers and vjholesalers handling products 
containing Soya, v.-e refer to the January 31 Bulletin. 



POTATOES ARE PLEJTIFULl 
Help Liove the Abundant Supply.

A flat roast will cook in less time than a chunk};- one of the same

SAVE FATS FOR BULLETS! 



December 3? 



It is imperative that all fats be put to full kitchen usa^e bef ore' poinf] to ■ ' ' 
salvage. This is to be accomplished by kitchen rendering and utilizing fully- 
all fats and cracklings. 

The m.ethod of rendering depends upon the equipment available. For all methods ^ 
freshly trimmed fat should be cut into small evenly sized pieces or ground through 
the coarse plate of a food chopper. The size of the utensil will depend upon 
the amount to be rendered. 

The freshly trimmed fat should be rendered daily and used daily. The methods 
of rendering are: (1) Top of stove; (2) Oven; (3); Steam-Jacketed Kettle; 
(4) Deep Fat Fryer. 

For methods 1, 2, and 3^ cover the bottom of the pan, pot or kettle with water, 
add fat, cover, heat, and stir occasionally, V/hen water evaporates, pour off 
the fat as if accumulates to prevent scorching fat; pass through a collander 
lined with a cleen cloth. Filter when filter is available and press the remain- 
ing fat from the cracklings and strain. 

For method ky place the chopped or ground fat in a fine mesh basket and fry out 
fat at 250 to 300 F. Dip or pour off fat as it accumulates and strain through 
filter. Use this fat for surface or shallow frying, pastries_, breads, and 
griddle cakes. Use the cracklings as fat for stews or gravy base or use in 
crackling breads or for kitchen-made soap. 

For deep fat frying use frying temperature of 380^F or approximately ten degrees 
lower than for vegetable fab. to prolong frying life of fat. To fully utilise the 
fat for deep frying ^ keep fryer clean and strain fat each time used. Replace the 
fat absorbed into the fried food by adding fresh fat as needed o The f resh f at 
added regularly helps increase frying life. 

17hen the fat in the fryer starts to foam excessively or gets very dark, continue 
frying for that meal and diacard the fat for soap-raaking or salvage. Collect 
this broken-down fat m No. 10 cans .and hold 'for salvage pick-up. 

It is not necessary to discard fat -after . frying fish. Either hold for additional 
cooking of fish or clarify by straining, cleaning the kettle and cooking a half 
basket of quartered potatoes and use for additional fish frying, (over)

Telephone Exbrook 838l-Ex,l4.7 



Skim off surplus fats fron soups, ste';.'S and gravy and evaporate off the water, 
then use for cooking or soap-making purposes. 

For lig^ht stock, cook all bones from which meat has been trimmed closely and 
skim off all fai. 

From bro'iA/n stock, brown bcnes slightly before cookin?!. Four off the fat and 
use the brovmed bones for brown stock for gravy and brown stews. 

Dry drained cooked bones can be put into corrugated paper cartons or suitable 
coataiuers and turned over to salvage or rendering works.

and make the ration points go farther, Tieing in with the bulletin 
on good brealcCasts from the Industrial Nutrition Service, we would 
like to suggest serving variety meats such as liver, kidneys and 
sweetbreads, all on the lovj-point list. 

Tasty breakfast stand-bys are Bacon, Bacon Squares and fresh 
Pork Sausage — also on the loiv-point list, and a favorite with men. 
A combination hard to beat is Bacon and Eggs. Eggs are still in 
plentiful supply, so serve them often. 

By including these foods in your dail3^ m.enus you are doing your

ECONOMICAL MEAT DISIIES 



With meat unrationod (except beef), let's watch our menu- 
planning and serve the unrationed meat whenever possible. This 
way everyone vjill be sr rin£ in the present food supply. 



In all meats the choice cuts are good, for short orders — 
but expensive! In many instances the less expensive and less 
popular cuts of meat lend the/as elves to tasty and appetizing 
dishes. Planning of economical cuts snows good managing of food 
costs . 

Vary the entree of the dailv menu to include such dishes as: 



Meat Casseroles 
Pot Roasts 
Goulash 
Sauerbraten ■ 
Braised Keck Slices 
Variety Meats

They are good eating - a pick-up for the "much used" menus — 
give eye appeal in well balanced meals. 'That are they? SALADS and 
FRESH VEGETABLES'. 

The vegetable market is beginning to show seasonal crops. 
Because they are hard to- ■ store, these foods should be used immediately .

SWEET POTATOES 



There is a plentiful supply of sweet potatoes from the northern 
San Joaquin Valley and an abundant harvest of banana squash in the same 
ares. This assures us of ample quantities of these foods to give variety 
to meals during the early winter months. 

Sweet potatoes have a high vitamin A content which helps prevent 
night blindness and a high vitamin C content. They are high in caloric 
value and if eaten in a large enough quantity they also supply thiamin, 
niacin, riboflavin and iron, 

Of the variety of ways sweet potatoes can be served here are a 
few of the more unusual,. Rash browned; mashed sweet potato cakes, sweet 
potato and apple scallop, and sweet potato pie.

MEAT COOKERY 



Until recently, most of the studies on meat cookery have been 
aimed at getting information for the homemaker. Mow through the spon- , 
sorship of the National Livestock and Meat Board much more is being 
learned about large quantity meat cookery. 

The shrinkage of meat during cooking not only affects the number 
of servings of meat obtainable, and, therefore, the cost of the meat as 
served, but also, its appearance and palatability. The cookery method 
and the degree of doneness are two of the most important factors affect- 
ing shrinkage of meat during cooking and both of these can be controlled 
in the kitchen. ■ i 



Meat shrinks during cooking regardless of. the method used, 
are two kinds -of losses: 



There 



x Xm Evaporation or the loss of water and other volatile 
; substances from the surface of the meat as it cooks. 

2. Pan drippings, or the.lss of fat, vjater, salts and 
flavoring substances in the meat which accumulate in 
the pah as the meat cooks. 

The result of all research in meat cookery is summarized in the 
statement ithat high temperatures have no plac e in meat cookery . Low 
cooking temperatures not only -produce more palatable meat, but also 
more serving . '• • • • -\| 

The old idea that searing meat holds the juices in has been 
proven erroneous. Although low temperatures are recommended there is 
a point below which there is no saving" in shrinkage, because of -the 
unusually long period of time required, to ; cook the- meat. Not only is 
the loss of weight decreased by. low Cooking temperature, but the decrease 
in the slicing surface of' the meat is largely prevented. In fact, the 
higher the temperature , the greater the: decrease in . slicing surface .

Since searing does not hold in the juices, a constant low tempera - 
ture has several advantages: 

1. Shrinks the meat less than most searing methods; 

2. Uses less fuelj 

3. It is easier to control and to duplicate the results 

than by the searing method; 

4. Less watching is necessary; 

5. There is less spattering and burning of fat on ovens, 

pans and racks. 

The degree of doneness to which meat is cooked may influence its 
shrinkage as much or even more, in some instances, than the temperature 
at which it is cooked, As the degree of doneness is increased, the 
shrinkage is inoreased. Pork is at its best only when it is cooked well 
done, but even large pork roasts become dry and shrink unduly when over 
cooked an extra 30 minutes. Beef and lamb are too frequently over. cooked. 
When cooked less done they are juicier and more flavorful a*id there is ' 
more meat to serve. It is important, therefore, in conserving meat to 
cook it only to the degree of doneness considered most palatable by. those 
being served. ;'■ • - ; • •' '•' 



In making these tests a meat thermometer was inserted 'well' into 
the roasts and away from the bone, and the roasts cooked to identical 
interior temperature. .... .. ., .... • ,• ■ " , "■■ '■■ T,

CURRENT 

The EGG Situation The supply of fresh egis has i^crea|ed 14 ' 

•greatly. Because of this there is a need for your cooperation to 
include EGGS in the daily menus as often as possible.! 



U.S. BEPAKTMC-- 



Shipments of eggs already received on the Pa! 
are one-third greater than this time last year. 



'oast 



Egg production is near its peak and the early Spring 

season and favorable weather conditions have done much 

to increase the early availability of this important food. 

Wartime transportation situation plus the rapidly disap- 
pearing Western storage facilities make it imperative 
that extra efforts be made to keep this record production 
moving' from farm" to civilians. 

PUSH EGG DISHES .... Stretch ration points. They are an economical 
food. Use them and make good percentages. 

This comparative chart giving wholesale prices and weight of eggs accord- 
ing to sice will show the best buy for institutional users: 



(Grade A large 
( 24 oz. per Doz. 
( 

( $.37 - $.38-4 



Grade A Medium 



Grade A Small ) 



21 oz. Per Doz. 18-21 oz, per Doz.) 



0.31 - 0.32-i; 



- ^.23 



This chart is based on Federal inspection minimum weights 
per dozen in the three size categories. 

You will note that mediums are $.06 per dozen cheaper than large, with 
a three ounce difference in weight and t hat small are ^.16 (average) 
cheaper than the large with the weight difference only four and one- 
half ounces (average).

SERVING MNY. 



:,rtvjU^''^'^*^ "(.(Formerly Institutional Food Service) 
^ ^. ..According tojjji^.-l'fe^ Food Administration's recent National survey, nearly 

halX-o^-^tlTe ^vorkers in manufacturing industries obtain food froiii^luncfc stand s,- 
canteens, food wagons, and food, dispensers, Sand^viches are an important part 
of the lunch menu for these workers -r and for many others who, find it inconvenT^^^^^:^ 
lent or impossible to secure a plate lunch. 



Standards for Sand^/viches : 



Sandwiches should contain substantial and appetizing filling s |-6hl*tP^?^dvi'^e 
good, quality protein and other essential nutrients. They "hHty,iili?Ti mnidr -"f- 



G45 



two full slices of bread (all vihite bre:ad should be enriched), spread with 
at least one-half ounce of butter or fortified margarine, ' and filled with not 
less than 1-1/2 ounces of sliced meat, chicken or cheese, or with 1-1/2 to 2 
ounces of mixed fillings such as chopped meat, chicken, egg, and fish salads, 
cottage cheese, baked beans, and nut spreads, A sandwich, made .according to ■ 
these directions can be expected to supply about AOO calories. 

Salad dressing and mustard-flavored '.'spreads" add some caloric value and flavor 
to sandwiches but are not a substitute in nutritive value for butter and for- 
tified margarine, and they should not be used in place of butter or fortified 
m.argarine. 

Plenti:^ul Foods for S a nd^viches : . 

Peanut butter, citrus marmalade, and other fruit jams and jellies are plenti- 
ful foods this month. Sandwiches made with a filling of peanut butter and 
marmalade or other tart conserve are easy to prepare and usually are well liked. 

Peanut butter is a rich source of protein and contains appreciable amounts of 
the B Vitamins. 

Citrus marmalade, combined with cream or cottage cheese, extends the cheese, 
and makes a good sandwich. 

No-point m.eats that are reasonably plentiful .include 'Utility grade beef, un- 
rationed cuts of pork, and the variety meats. When properly prepared these 
meats make delicious sandwich fillings, high in food value.

Breads for Sandvdchcs: 



Bread may be purcr-ased alre-idy sliced, or it be sliced, 3/8 to l/2 inch 
thick, depending on the kind of filling used, -'/hite, whole-vjheat , cracked- 
v.'he.'-vt, '^-nd rye breads ray be appropriately used, for raost sandwiches, "Tv;o- 
toned" sand:viches may be made x-jith a slice of v-'hite and a slice of ■vvholo-v.'heat 
bread, to increase the use of whole-^roin cereal. The occasional use of spec- 
ial broads, such as steamed brown bread, nut bread, and fruit breads, give an 
interesting variety to sandiviches , Simple fillings, such as cream cheese and 
sliced American cheese, are the most suitable to combine with these fancy 
breads , 

i' to Make Sand^viches : 

1. Allow plenty of .working soace 'and asserAble all the necessary food supplies, 
utensils and cutlory. ' ■ '■ ■ 

2. Prepare the- fillings before beginning ^ to spread' the sandwiches. If lettuce 
is to be used it should be washed, drained' ^nd chili ed- previously. 

3. Soften butter or margarinri- by allo:ving it- to stand, at room temperature and 
then'vjhip it in the electric mixer.' Melted butter- should not be used. 

h. Arrange slices of bread in even rows on the vjork 'surface, with the slices 
matched in size. 

5. Place a spoonful of butter or fortified margarine in the center of each 
slice. 

6. Sprer. d bread to the edges. Buttering both slices prevents soaking of the 
bread when moist fillirig mixtures or fresh vegetables arc used. 

7. ''-hen using sandwich md: es' measure them with a large spoon or a naiiber 2U 
ice-cream sc-oop. In this vjay a uniform- serviag m.ay be obtained. Place 
fillings on alternate slices of bread;, spreading the filling evenly. 

8. Put slices of -bread tog-ether and press firmly. 'Trap in vjaxed paper or 
'place in a waxed bag. - • ' ■ •

TEH TIPS FOR HOT WEATH1 



CHEFS, STEWARDS AND WORKERS IN INDUSTRIAL FEEDING! Don't 
sabotage your food by neglecting the rules of good storage 
and preparation. Waste not - want not - you have heard 
before. So don't forget the tricks you've read about pre- 
paration of fruit and vegetables. 



Highlights for hot weather ahead suggest a colorful spring- 
tossed salad or a fruit salad bowl, using some of the new 
fruits just in season. Even though you are accustomed to 
rationing by now, are you still having trouble making your 
ideas and your ration points come out even? Fresh fruits 
do double duty by conserving canned ones and taking the 
nlace of a dessert such as pie or cake. 



Women war workers, too, will find the attached bulletin of 
good food ideas helpful in their menu-planning . By trying 
these tips they will be better prepared to repeat them again, 



EGGS AND ONIONS are our two plentiful foods 
at this season of the year, so use them often in 

cooking \

SOYA PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTION 
(January 31, 1944) 




This is a partial list of companies handling products containing 
soya, the names of the products distributed, and their areas of distri- 
bution. 

■ To give a complete list of domestic soya products and their dis- 
tribution is impractical at this time. In furnishing this partial list 
in an effort to aid you, it should be understood that no discrimination 
is intended and no guarantee of reliability is implied. 

Before using the list, it may be well to remember three points: 

1. Distribution of soya products is still not 
thorough in all localities, but it has spread 
rapidly in the past few months and companies 
indicate that further expansion is planned. 
With new food products, increases in consumer 
demand and distribution must go hand-in-hand. 

2. It cannot be expected that all wholesalers in 
all localities will carry all products. Con- 
sumers who cannot find certain items and vjho 
wish to have them stocked should let this fact 
be known to their local distributors. 

3. This list will be revised from time to time so 
that any others not listed can be added.

CABBAGE for VARIETY CRISPNESS and FLAVOR'. 



Uar Food Administration has designated CABBAGE as a Victory Food ' 
Selection from the period February 24 to liarch 4. We are asking the 
cooperation of all to stress the value of Cabbage and feature it iii 
menus to help relieve the supply of this product on the market. 

A lot can be done vjith CABBAGE in the preparation and planning of 
meals. It is a versatile vegetable rich in food values uhich aid in 
meeting the many food requirements necessary to maintain good health. 

CABBAGE is much more popular and more apt to be eaten if properly 
cooked and attractively served. For a good early spring tonic, serve 
a crisp COLE SLAIY or FRUIT and CABBAGE SALAD. In preparation, we should 
follow the Chinese method of cooking vegetables, especially green leafy 
varieties. Their way of having vegetables chevjy and not soft is the best, 
not only for taste but for eye appeal. There is bettei" color, more food 
value and a more palatable dish when cabbage is cooked for a short period 
of time, ' 

There are many ways you can include cabbage in meal planning; for 
instance, a-s a side— serving of cole slaw v.dtr sand\;iche£ instead of the 
usual pickle or relish. Added to the serving of a hot dish, it will give 
cris'pness to the meal. Cabbage Salad does hot require an oil dressing, 
thereby effecting a savir^ .in fat ration points. It is one ' salad which 
is 'complemented by a simple dressing of vinegar, sugar and seasoning. 



POT>iTOES ARE PLENTIFUL, Kelp Move the Surplus!

Served raw, three-fourths of a cup of CABBAGE compares favorably 
in food value v.itii one Orange, one cup of rav,; Spinach, or one-half 
Green Peppei-. 

For variation add slivers of Carrots, Chopped Fruit, or Sweet Cream 
vdth horseradish and lemon juice, or sour cream dressing to the Cabbage 
Salad, 

Cooked^ Cabbage also blends vvfell with other foods when served as soup, 
vegetable dr raain dish. . . - 

Plan to serve Cabbage as often as possible during the period of 
February 24 to Inarch L.

NEWS AND VimS I 



Are your menus tieing in with the National No-Point- • 
Low-Point Campaign? Seasonal fresh vegetables supplement the 
no-point list and help a great deal to stretch the ration . 
points. These vegetables bring color and variety to the every 
day meal service. — 

For the Western Region carrots and beets are in good 
supply. They make attractive servings of salads, soup and 
many vegetable dishes — hearty vegetables which will stand 
up during the length of time held on the steam table for serv- 
ing. Others on the available list are Asparagus, New Turnips, 
Large Potatoes and Lettuce. 

. California Industrial Caterers and Restaurateurs — NEWS 
FOR YOU — the meat points on LA:23 have been lowered in the 
State for a certain period of time. The wise manager will take 
advantage- of 'this and serve lamb as a meat dish whenever possible. 

Lack of feed - lack of market - brings the reduction of 
points on Soring Lamb, Institutions, Industrial Feeders and 
Restaurants are quantity users and by cooperating can do their 
share in helping to create a market which will assist in the 
development of a demand for the early lambs. This demand is a 
measure to prevent a large loss of animals which should be saved 
for food. USE THE AVAILABLE FOODS - AVOID WASTE. 




. remember: 

Egg Production is at its peak and will be 
at least through Kay 15th I

In the summer month menus specialize in egg dishes, salads and desserts. 
They are filling but not too heavy for the hot weather months. 

Looking for a new flavor to change an old dish? --- Prepare a thin white 
sauce and add three hard cooked eggs, diced, to each cup of white sauce. Serve 
With fish or vegetables.

SERVING YkWi 



(Formerly Institutional Food Service) 

I'ackerel, if served on iTednesday, and Cod Fillet on Friday, in all indus- 
trial feeding establishjuents, restaurants, colleges, hospitals and other 
institutions in one weelc would go far toward solving one of this country's 
irnaiediate v«artime food storage problems. 'Tith present supplies of these 
varieties of frozen fish abundant, there is an. opportunity to secure plenty 
of this quickly and easily prepared, non-rationed meat alternate. Wider 
use of this good, edible fish will also help make storage room for the new 
run of fish. 

Varieties of frozen fish, in supplj' greatly above normal, include cod 
fillets, mackerel, flounders, scup,. lake herring, and pike. Shellfish 
is not abundant, and canned fish is scarce, Some of the supplies are in 
whole fish, but the bulk is frozen fillets vihich can be prepared for serv- 
ing with less labor and no loss through dressing. Considerable quantities 
of packaged frozen fillets are in one pound packages. The balance is in 
packages of varying sizes of 10, 15, 20 and 30 pounds, Labor-saving costs 
and other advantages of using packaged frozen foods, as described by some 
of the leading restaurateurs of the country, held the attention of several 
thousand of their representatives duruig an entire morning session at the 
recent National '"artime Conference of the National Restaurant Association 
in Chicago. The use of packrxged quick-frozen foods was hailed as one of 
the most importiint nev; trends in restaurant operation. 



Food Value - 

Fish makes an important contribution to the diet. As an unrationed food 
alternate it may be used to meet some of the meat shortages. It is an 
excellent source of high quality protein; that is, all the amino acids 
for growth and maintenance of weight are included. It is also an excellent 
source of niacin, one of the B' complex vitamins. 



Sta ndard Portion : 

A good standard edible portion of fish is one-half pound per person. This 
is the size portion usually served in hotels, restaurants, and Army camps, 
VJl'ien ordering whole fish, one pound per person should be purchased, -.'s 
fish dresses away about fifty percent, (over)

Featuring Fish ; 

As there v;ill be a Maticn-Tvide effort made to feature fish in nation'-^l 
inagazines and newspapers and on the radio to help increase the consumption 
of frozen fish and relieve this wartime food storage problem, food service 
managers and dietitians can keep in tune with the times and be of re-il ser- 
vice to the country if meals are planned that include fish prepared and 
served so that it will appeal to the appetite. Here are some suggestions 
offered by the Har Food Administration. 

1. Feature an abundant vari^^ty of fish on a FOOD FOP. FP5ED0M 
or V'^'^TORY menu twice a week. 

2. Plan menus when using fish entrees thnt include colorful, 
nutritious green or yellow vegeta.bles or fruits. 

3. Cook fish in a variety of ways. Fat fish, such as mackerel, 
should be broiled or baked instead of fried. Lean fish, 
like cod, should not be broiled, but should be boiled, baked 
in milk, or fried. Fish should alvjays be cut into serving 
portions before cooking. It may be baked, boiled, broiled, 
steamed, deep-fat fried, or pan-fried, '^'■Jhen oan-frying, 
dryness can be prevented if fish is cooked 3 minutes, removed 
to back of range, kept covered about 2 minutes, then turned 
and cooked ov^r flame 3 minutes longer, 

A. Serve tomato sauce with fish, or add color and aopetite apoijal 
with a garnish of sliced lemon, parsley, or rav; carrot sticks. 

5. Use left overs in fish cakes, croquettes, souffles, or chowders, 

6. Preserve flavor .md moisture in fis.h by proper cooking and well- 
timed prepar'ition so that it does not stand long before s^^rving . 

How O ne Dietitian I'ak.es Wull-Balanced Lunches Popular . 

The dietitian at the Thompson Aircraft Products- Company plant near Cleveland 
has a clcver way of having workers v;rite their ovjn menus. For several weeks 
she displayed on every table in 'the cafeteria table tent c'ards ■'"dth brief 
items about the Basic 7 foods n>jt,;ded in well-balanced meals,-"- Then she 
launched a menu-planning Contest asking i/jorkers to write th^ir menu sugges- 
tions on new tent card's' provided on cafeteria tables. V.ore suggestions came 
from mun than v.'omun workers. So many menus were good that every day's menu 
tent card carries a •''.''orker ' s menu with a credit line. Kany of the workers 
siiggested menus "that feature fish. ■ '

PATIOIJING HOLIDAY I 



A chance to call a Holiday — CPA's release from rationing 
of some Meats on tlie market v^ill pive you a bre?.th.lng spell on 
the point situation. Pi'esent point allot;nents will be cut in 
half and you rjill, undoubtedly^ be notified very soon concerning 
your allotment by your local OPA Board. 



The American Farmer has done a lyvonderful job of producing. 
Because of the reraarl cable ,]ob done on hog production ^ there has 
been a temoorary removal of Pork from, the i^ation list* Let's 
give a hand to the farmers and livestock men of il^ierica. Through 
their efforts and viork, they have made possible in the last few 
weeks the removal from, rationing of all meats (except Beef Steaks 
and Roasts), all Frorren Fruits and Vegetables, all Dried Fruits, 
many important Canned Vegetables, Lard, Shortening, and Salad and 
Cooking Oils, and point suspension of many other item.s. 



5^gs are still in abundance — and storage space continues 
critical. Feature Egg dishes - the good old American custom of 
Ham 'n Eggs or Sausage and Scrambled Eggs. This way you can 
increase the 'veekly usage, help the farmers, transportation and 
storage facilities. 



The same thing is true of Potatoes, Carrots, Beets, Lettuce 
and Spinach. Good m.enu-planning and including these foods in 
meals served rdll help aistribute the plentiful supplies and keep 
production rolling.

THE NATIONAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR INDUSTRY 



The major causes of malnutrition in the United States can be classified 
into four groups: 

1. Poor Food Habits; 

2. Failures in Provision; 

3. Economic Factors; 
U. Metabolic Stress, 

The conditions of unusual metabolic stress, "such as illness, increased 
v; or king hours, extremes of temperatures, speed-up work, insufficient rest, 
etc., which increase energy consumption, produce a proportionate increase 
in the body's nutritional requirements. The effects upon the individual 
of nutritional deficiencies acquired during such periods may be long stand- 
ing and far reaching". 

Efforts to improve the nutritional status of the workers should be strictly 
cooperative by Management 'and the employees. Each meal served within the 
plant should be designed to furnish at least one-third of the workers' daily 
dietary requirements. Employing a well trained dietitian to manage the cafe- 
teria would serve- at .. the 'same time to increase the nutritional value of the 
meals and decrease the overhead. Small plants in a community might jointly 
employ one dietitian to supervise the quality of the meals served and the 
marketing for each of them. Intelligent marketing serves to keep down costs. 
Such marketing requires an understanding of the nutritional values of foods, 
in addition to a knowledge of where and when to buy. In other instances, 
small plants may call upon the local nutrition- committees for advice. 

Whether the lunch program is operated by Management or by a feeding con- 
tractor, we recommend that the plant management should always be responsible 
for the quality of meals served and the cost of the meals to the employees. 

Cooperation of the workers will have to be enlisted through a carefully 
planned program supported by a promotional campaign.

\ \& COOK ING LESS TEMPER MEATS 

Generally speakYng, tl^|p^ct>oklnsjoJ>3re^*s tender neats falls into two categ- 
ories - braising\$jre^inimering, or stewing, Both ways, the meat is cooked 
by moist heat, \orne, .cuts of veal and thin cuts of pork, such as chops and 
steaks, are betteTif braised even though they are tender. They must be 
cooked veil done and braising will do this without drying them out. For 
variety, other tender cuts of meat are sometimes braised. 

In braising, the meat is first browned in its own fat or in a smaller amount 

of added fat. It is then covered and cooked slowly in its own juices or in 

a small amount of liouid. Braising is often called pot roasting or fricaseeing. 

Meat dishes cooked by braising may be classified according to the size, thick- 
ness, and shape of the cut in this manners 

1. Pot Roast and variations , 3. Veal Chops, Steaks and Cutlets 

2. Swiss Steaks and variations 4. Pork Chops and Steaks 

5. Fricasees, Caserole Dishes, Meat Birds, Mock Drumsticks, etc. 
St ens in Braising - 

(A) Season meat with salt and pepper and dredge with flour, if desired- 
(If flour is used the seasoning may be mixed with the flour. . Use one 

teaspoon of salt to each pound of meat). Flour increases browning but may be 
omitted . 

(B) Brown meat on .all sides in a small amount of fat. (If meat is not dredged 
with flour, it may be browned in its oxvn fat. Browning develops aroma, flavor 
and color) . 

(C) Add a small amount of liquid if needed to increase tenderness or if de- 
sired for a sauce. (Liouid may be water, meat stock, milk, sour cream, to- 
mato ( iuice, etc . ) . 

(D) Cover with close-fitting lid to retain the steam. (Long, slow cooking 

in moisture makes the meat tender or cooks it well done without drying it out). 

(S) Cook until tender, or until the meat thermometer registers 185° to 
195°F. 

(F) Remove meat and make gravy. (Gravy is an essential part of braised 
meat dishes since the drippings contain much flavor and food value).

'COD CONSERVATION MEASURES 



Food conservation means proper care and serving of foods. 
Not only is it protection against poisoning, but is an economical 
measure in managing any feeding facility. 

There is a period of development of bacteria between 50°F 
and 130 °F which is called a danger period, or period of incubation. 
Oftentimes it is impossible to tell by the smell, taste or feel 
whether the food is harmful. Be cn the safe side and keep a rigid 
temperature control on steam tables and places where food is stored 
while waiting to be prepared or served. 



DOs and DOM'Ts 



,he Handling of Different Foods: 



DEHYDRATED FOOD - 

If held more than three hours after moisture has been added, 

food should be cooled to below 50°F or heated to 130°F or over until 
ready to be eaten. 

SOUP STOCK - 

Handle with particular care. It must be cooled rapidly to 
50°F and held between 36° - 3'3°F not longer than three Hays- ,hpif nrs 

serving. Soup stock spoils readily if temperature is at o-£e ^8°F\ c^> /2\ 



POULTRY 



CU.i 



Do not hold stuffed bird out of refrigeration. | The dressing 

should never be held at a temperature above or below the danger point. 

While serving do not hold fowl at the incubation temperature more than 
four hours. I u.s. dlpartmlm 

COOKED HAM - 

Do not hold cooked hams longer than six hours at a temperature 
between 50°F and 130 F, Keep cooked hams that are on a steam table at 
130°F or above.

vegetables free from blemishes and soft spots. If vegetables must be stpred'T or' g,

Hox^^ to h andle cooked veget ables; Nothing is less appealing 'tO' the ^eye'or to the 
appetite than water-lagged ^ overcooked vegetables. V7hen cooking and serviiig veg- 
etables, follow these rules: • . . . ,• • 

1. Prepare vegetables just before they are cooked. 

2. Cook quickly, in as little boiling,^ salted water as possible. • 

3. Use the steam- jacketed kettle""for c-ookiing leafy and green vegetables* 

4. Don't add soda to the cooking water. 

5. Cook until barely, tender (additional cooking occurs on the steam _ table) * 

6. Plan the vegetable cooking so that freshly cooked vegetables can be 
served every 20 to 30 minutes. 

An average serving of cooked carrots (3^ ounces) v;hen properly prepared may provid 
sufficient Vitamin A (carotene) tormeet 3 days' requirements of this vitamin f^ 
the moderately active man. Turnip greens, swiss chard, and .beet greens each pro- 
vide more than 1 day,'s needs. Peas provide one-seventh and ,stj:ing (snap) beans, 
one-eighth of the Vitamin A, needs. Cooked turnip greens are also a good source 
of Vitamin C, providi^ig- nearly one-third of the daily requirement »
