This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 
to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other marginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 
publisher to a library and finally to you. 

Usage guidelines 

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible. Public domain books belong to the 
public and we are merely their custodians. Nevertheless, this work is expensive, so in order to keep providing this resource, we have taken steps to 
prevent abuse by commercial parties, including placing technical restrictions on automated querying. 

We also ask that you: 

+ Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals, and we request that you use these files for 
personal, non-commercial purposes. 

+ Refrain from automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system: If you are conducting research on machine 
translation, optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful, please contact us. We encourage the 
use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help. 

+ Maintain attribution The Google "watermark" you see on each file is essential for informing people about this project and helping them find 
additional materials through Google Book Search. Please do not remove it. 

+ Keep it legal Whatever your use, remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal. Do not assume that just 
because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States, that the work is also in the public domain for users in other 
countries. Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country, and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of 
any specific book is allowed. Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner 
anywhere in the world. Copyright infringement liability can be quite severe.

PREFACE. 



In compliance with the request of many friends, 
I venture to present this work to the public, in 
the hope that it may supply a want which I felt 
so seriously in the early *days of my housekeep- 
ing experience. From that time, it has been my 
rule to preserve every receipt which proved suc- 
cessful; and, after twenty years' experience, I 
feel some confidence in offering a few hints, in 
connection with the receipts, which have all 
been tested with perfect success. Should any 
fail, I ask the indulgence of my ^-eaders, and beg 
them to try again, and, perhaps, with a little more 
care, — as accuracy, next to cleanliness, is of the 
greatest importance in cookery. All cooking uten- 
sils should be the perfection of neatness, and it is 
scarcely necessary to say the same of the kitchen 
and store-room. Much time might be saved by 
having every thing in order and at hand con- 
venient for use. It should be remembered that 
"any thing worth doing at all is worth doing 
well." The comfort of home depends very much 
upon the arrangement of the kitchen. Work 
should be done quietly, and at the proper season.

vi Preface. 

All orders should be given before serving meals : 
a good dinner is often spoiled by confusion. If 
poaaibley the mistress of a household should 
always be pleasant and calm. It is impossible 
for a mistress to order or superintend, unless she 
be competent. First, she should instruct herself, 
then her servants. Each person must have a 
system of her own. It would be presumptuous 
for me to ask all to follow my plans : " experi- 
ence is the best teacher; " and I can only hope 
the few suggestions I haVe given may be of some 
use. 

My thanks are due to many of my lady friends 
for their kindness in giving me receipts tried by 
themselves and proved to be good. That this 
book may be received and honored by the kind- 
ness of the American ladies, to whom I dedicate 
it, with the earnest desire that it may prove a 
friend in many households, has been my object 
in writing it. 

Mrs. Shaw.

SOUPS. 

A Good Stock for Soups. 

Put into a good-sized soup-pot ten pounds (bone 
and meat) of the leg or shin of beef, an equal 
weight of real, an old fowl, and the bone of a ham, 
all well cut, with water enough to cover. Set it on 
the fire to boil for two hours ; then add six quarts of 
water, let it boil half an hour, skim thoroughly ; after 
which, add six carrots, four onions, three turnips, two 
heads of celery (tops and all), twelve cloves, and 
season with salt to taste. Then let the stock boil 
four hours, remove all grease from the top, strain 
through a sieve into earthen pans, and set away 
for use. 

Bread Crumbs for Soups. 

Take several thin slices of stale bread and cut into 
inch squares. Have ready on the fire a frying-pan 
with boiling hot lard, into which drop the crumbs 
and fry to a light brown color. Skim them out, and 
drain on a sieve. 

These will keep for days, and are nice to serve 
with all kinds of soup.

Portable Soup. 

Let veal or beef soup get quite cold, then skim oflf 
every particle of fat, boil it till of a thick glutinous 
consistency. Care should be taken not to have the 
soup bum. Season it very highly with pepper, salt, 
cloves, and mace, add a little brandy or wine, and 
pour it on earthen platters not more than an inch in 
thickness. Let it be till cold, then cut in three-inch 
square pieces, set them in the sun to dry, often turn- 
ing them. When very dry, put them in a tin or 
earthen dish, having a layer of white paper between 
each layer of cakes. These, if the directions are

FISH. 

Great care should be taken in the selection of fish. 
If fresh, the eyes will be full, the flesh firm, and the 
odor sweet; but it is better to trust to the judgment 
of one who deals constantly in fish, than to your 
own. 

In boiling fish, if ,you have no fish-drainer, tie or 
sew in a clean white cloth, that there may be no 
danger of breaking in removing it from the water. 
Fresh fish should be put into hot water, salted. Use 
cold water for salt fish. 

In preparing fresh fish for fr3ring or broiling, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, that it may penetrate 
thoroughly. 

Salmon Boiled. 

If a whole salmon is required, cut into perhaps 
three pieces, or gash it in three places and twist 
into the form of an S ; put it in the fish-kettle, with 
a little salt, and cover with boiling water. Allow 
ten minutes' boiling to every pound of salmon, or 
one hour to a piece weighing six pounds. Serve on 
a napkin, dressed with hard-boiled eggs, sliced lemon, 
and parsley, with egg or lobster sauce.

Salmon Broiled. 

Cut the fish in slices from one to two inches in 
thickness, dip each piece in flour or com meal, put

loin, next to the rump, which secures a tenderloin 
on the under side of the roast. There are also quite

POULTRY. 

As poultry and game sometimes come unplacked, 
it is necessary to know how to dress it. Lay the 
bird with the head towards you, and draw the feath- 
ers out in the direction they He ; be careful to take 
out all the pin-feathers. After it is well plucked, 
cut a gash and take out the crop, cut off the neck, 
and cut under the tail and remove all the inwards 
carefully, from which separate the liver, heart, and 
gizzard ; cut open the gizzard and take away the 
inside. These last are used for the giblet sauce. 
Wash all thoroughly in several waters. 

Partridges, quail, and other small birds, are usu- 
ally skinned, as the feathers are very thick, and it is 
almost impossible to pluck them without tearing the 
skin. 

The appearance of poultry on the table depends 
much upon its being well skewered. If you have 
no skewers, you can keep the fowl, in shape by tying 
the wings and legs close to the body. There should 
be a rack to lay fowls on to keep them from die 
bottom of the pan. 

Roast Turkey. 

After cleaning and drying nicely, fill the breast 
and body with dressing, sew up, and tie carefully to 
keep it in form. Rub with salt and pepper, and 
dredge with flour, put in the pan with a little water, 
put in the oven, baste and dredge constantly. Have

a cup with some melted butter in it, and occasionally 
pour some over the turkey before putting the flour

turkey will require three hours' cooking. 

Boiled Turkey. 
Stuff as for Roast Turkey, be careful to tie it

Chestnut Dressing. 
Make dressing as for Turkey, but without the 
oysters. Boil a pint of chestnuts, peel them, and 
put them into the dressing whole. 

To bone a Turkey. 

Wash the turkey clean, and wipe it dry inside 
and out. Break the first joint of the leg, and with 
a narrow and very sharp knife cut all around the 
bone, being careful not to break the skin or flesh, and, 
keeping the knife close to the bone, pull out the 
bone ; then break the second joint, and cut the flesh 
off in the same manner. Proceed thus with the 
other leg and the wings, taking out one joint at a 
time. Then from the inside cut the flesh off close 
to the breast-bone, and take it out# This requires 
great care and patience, but with a little practice it 
can be done without breaking the flesh at all. 

Take out the back-bone in the same way, though 
this is often left to keep the turkey in better shape. 
Fill all the cavities with a nice dressing, making the 
turkey look as it did before the bones were removed ; 
sew up all torn and broken places, tie it carefully, 
and bake or boil it. Serve cold. 

If you wish to make a very ornamental dish, cool 
it in jelly in the following manner: Have a dish 
large enough to hold the turkey without letting it 
touch the bottom or sides, suspend the turkey in it by 
strings, put a little jelly in the bottom, and with it a 
few olives, gherkins, or any small ornamental pickles ; 
let the jelly cool, then put in a few more pickles

and more jelly, till the turkey is covered, letting 
each layer of jelly become quite cool before adding 
another. When it is solid, turn out on a platter, 
and garnish to taste. For this dish, it will be neces- 
sary to take out the back-bone, so that the whole 
can be cut in nice slices. Use aspic jelly or wine 

jelly.

BREAD. 

The most important thing in making good whole- 
some bread is the utmost cleanliness, and next the 
best of all ingredients. There must also be atten- 
tion and care throughout. Sometimes a second 
quality of flour with a half mixture of the best 
will make nice bread, when either alone would be 
a failure. And flour that makes the best bread is 
not good for pastry. The second quality of flour is 
best for pastry and cake almost invariably. 

Hop Yeast. 
Boil half a pint of hops in a quart of water ; when 
it has foiled fifteen minutes, strain it through a 
cloth, and add two tablespoon fuls of salt and half a^ 
cup of sugar ; put the hop tea in a saucepan on the 
stove, mix some flour in cold water and stir into the 
hot tea, until it is about the thickness of thin batter ; 
boil five minutes, and set it away to cool. When 
lukewarm, add a cupful of yeast, and set it in a 
warm place to rise, then put it away in a stone jar. 

Potato Yeast. 
Boil some potatoes till very tender, peel and mash 
them fine, and to six potatoes add one cup of flour. 
Stir in of the water in which the potatoes were 
boiled enough to make a thick batter, add salt, and 
a cup of yeast, and put in a warm place to rise. 
When light, put away for use.

Bread. 



Set the sponge at night with a quart of flour, a 
little salt, a gill of yeast, and warm milk enough to 
make a thick batter. In the morning, stir in flour 
enough to form a dough, knead it thoroughly, and 
put it in a warm place. When it is light and 
spongy, knead it again, mould it into loaves, and put 
them into greased pans. As soon as they rise again, 
bake them. 

Allow one quart of flour for an ordinary sized 
loaf. If it is not convenient to use milk to mix 
bread, water will answer, with the addition of a 
little shortening. 

Potato Bread. 

Peel and boil some potatoes till very tender, mash 
them and add as much warm water as will make a 
batter as thick as cream, pass it through a sieve, 
when cool add a little salt and some yeast, and flour 
to make a thick batter, and let it rise. In twelve 
hours, stir in flour enough to make a dough, knead 
it well, and let it rise again. Then mould it into 
loaves and put it in the pans, let them rise, and bake 
slowly. 

Rye Bread. 

Two cups of wheat flour, two cups of rye, one- 
half cup of yeast, one tablespoon of brown sugar, a

batter with lukewarm water, and let it rise over 
night.

CAKE. 

General Directions for making Cake. 

Before beginning to mix cake, weigh or meas- 
ure all ingredients; use the same sized cup and 
spoon for all, so as to keep the true proportion. 
Wash the butter to remove all the salt. Scant the 
cups of butter and sugar, fill even full with flour, or, 
if it is very light, heap them a little. For all nice 
cake, eggs should be as fresh as possible, and the 
whites and yolks beaten separately. Use an earthen 
dish for mixing, as tin will impart a bad flavor to 
the cake. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, 
add the yolks of the eggs well beaten, then the 
whites ; dissolve the cream of tartar and soda in the 
milk, stir until it foams, and put it in next ; the 
flour should generally be added last. If you put 
fruit in the cake, roll it in some of the flour which is 
intended for the mixture, and stir it in the last thing. 
Line the pans with oiled paper, and let the paper 
come a little above the cake, so as to remove it when 
done without breaking.

Cake. 145 

The oven is another important consideration ; and 
every person should be well acquainted with the 
peculiarities of her own, as no two are alike, and 
no rule can be given which will answer for all. It 
is well to try it first with a small cake or piece of 
dough. Sponge and cream cakes require a quick 
oven, but should not be allowed to scorch too soon. 
Do not open the oven oftener than is necessary 
while the cake is in, or it may be made heavy. Try 
with a clean broom-straw in the thickest part : if no 
cake sticks to the straw, it is done. And usually the 
cake shrinks a little from the sides of the pan when 
it is baked enough. Do not let it cool in the pan, but 
take it out carefully, turn the pan over and stand it 
on the bottom, for a sudden chill may make it fall. 

In making Sponge Cake, the eggs should be 
beaten very light ; and, after adding the flour, stir 
only enough to mix it in well, and put immediately 
into the oven. Much depends upon the baking of 
this cake. 

To blanch almonds, pour boiling water over them, 
let them stand a few minutes, when the skins will 
rub off easily. W

PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

Peaches. 
Select nice free-stone peaches, not too ripe, put 
them into boiling water, so that the skins may be 
rubbed off easily. Weigh them, and allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. Put the sugar in a 
preserving kettle (porcelain is the best), with water 
enough to dissolve it; boil till it is quite clear, tak- 
ing off the scum as it rises. Lay in the peaches a 
few at a time, and cook fifteen or twenty minutes ; 
skim them out, and put into jars. When all are 
cooked, boil the syrup till it becomes quite thick, 
and pour it over the fruit. Cover the jars with a 
cloth until cold. Then wet a paper in brandy and 
put over the preserves, and tie a paper over the jar. 
Keep in a cool, dry place. Some prefer to take the 
stones from the peaches. In that case, the flavor 
will be improved by adding some of the kernels to 
the syrup. 

Pears. 

Wipe them and cut out all the specks. Allow a 
pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Put the pears, 
a few at a time, into a steamer, and steam till they 
are quite sold. Make a syrup as for peaches, and 
cook the pears in it fifteen minutes. Skim them 
out into jars, boil down the syrup and pour over 
them. When cold, put brandy papers on top, and 
tie up the jars.

cup full of fluid. Boil well, wash thoroughly, and 
rinse in two waters. 

To remove Ink Stains. 

The moment the ink is spilled, saturate the stain 
with milk, soak it up with a cloth and apply more, 
milk, rub well, and soon the ink will disappear. 

Tq take out Iron Rust. 

Wet the spot in lemon juice, and put salt thickly 
over it, set it in the hot sun, and as the lemon juice 
dries squeeze on more.

Strew powdered borax about where they appear. 
If faithfully followed^ this is a sure remedy.

To make a Mustard Draft. 

Take two-thirds mustard and one-third Indian 
meal, mix with the white of an Qg^ or warm water 
to a smooth paste, not too dry, but so that it will 
easily spread on a piece of thick linen or cotton ; 
put a piece of thin muslin on the side which is to go 
next the flesh. 

Convulsions. 

These are not unusual with children. Put imme- 
diately into a hot bath, in which put half a cup of 
mustard ; then roll in warm woollen blankets, bathe 
the face and head in cold water, and as soon as pos- 
sible give a teaspoonful of wine of ipecac every ten 
minutes until the child vomits. 

Sore Throat. 

No remedy has ever been used with more general 
satisfaction than Chlorate of Potassae. One tea- 
spoonful dissolved in a coffee-cup of hot water, and 
when cold gargle the throat every half hour or hour. 
There is no danger from swallowing a small quan- 
tity. A cold in the head is relieved by inhaling 
alcohol. 

Cuts. 

Wash the wound carefully, removing all dirt or 
foreign substances from it. Press the parts firmly 
together for five minutes by grasping with a towel ; 
then bring the parts accurately together, and apply 
strips of spread adhesive plaster five or six inches

long, and about a third of an inch wide, well warmed 
BO as to stick firmly. Cover the wound with a fold 
of soft linen, and apply a bandage firmly and evenly. 
If an artery has be6n wounded, the blood will be of 
a crimson color, and will flow with a beat like the 
pulse. In this case, apply at once to a surgeon. 

Burns and Scalds. 
If the skin is blistered so as to fill with water, 
puncture the blister with a needle at the lowest part 
to let out the fluid, always using extreme care not 
to remove or detach the skin ; then cover with a 
sheet of cotton wadding, smeared with a mixture of . 
equal parts of lime water and olive oil, to which a 
small quantity of carbolic acid may be added. This 
dressing should be retained until the burn is healed. 

Fainting. 
The countenance is pale, the pulse wanting or 
feeble. Place the person flat on the back, see that 
the clothing is loose, give plenty of fresh air, rub 
the limbs briskly, sprinkle the face lightly with cold 
water, and hold a bottle of ammonia occasionally/ 
to the nostrils. Give a stimulant if there is any 
tendency to a continuance or return of the fainting. 

Epilepsy. 

Usually the person utters a cry of distress, and 

falls ; the face is purple and convulsed, the mouth 

filled with foam, the whole body jerking for a few 

moments. These attacks are usually due to some

derangement of the digestive organs, and are seldom 
dangerous unless long continued. They are very 
apt to recur in the same person. The only treat- 
ment cU the time of the attack is to loosen the cloth- 
ing, and place the person in a quiet, cool place. 
Much can be done by skilful medical treatment in 
curing epilepsy. 

Fits, Unconscious Conditions, and Apoplexy. 

These occur in people, most usually, who are full 
blooded, after excess in eating or a fit of anger. 
The countenance is red, turgid; the pulse is full, 
the breathing heavy or snoring, intelligence absent. 
Place the person in a position with the head and 
shoulders raised, apply to the head bits of ice in a 
napkin, or bags, rubbed over the head, not kept in 
one position. Put the feet in a pail of hot water 
with mustard, and bleed from the arm. It must be 
remembered that in any unconscious state there is 
danger from using excessive heat or cold. 

Apoplexy should be placed in the care of a medi- 
cal attendant as quickly as possible. 

Marshall Hall's Ready Method in 
Asphyxia. 

1. Treat the patient instantly^ on the spot^ in the 
open aiVy freely exposing the face, neck, and chest 
to the breeze, except in severe weather. 

2. In order to clear the throat.^ place the patient 
gently on the face, with ope wrist under the fore-

head, that all fluid, and the tongue itself, may fall 
forward, and leave the entrance into the windpipe 
free. 

3. To excite respiration turn the patient slightly 
on the side, and apply some irritating or stimulating 
agent to the nostrils, as veratrine^ dilute ammo- 
nia^ &c. 

4. Make the face warm by brisk friction, then 
dash cold water upon it. 

5. If not successful, lose no time ; but, to imitate 
respiration^ place the patient on the face, and turn 
the body gently but completely on the side, and a 
little beyond; then again on the face, and so on, 
alternately. Repeat these movements deliberately 
and perseveringly fifteen times only in a minute. 
(When the patient lies on the thorax, this cavity 
is compressed by the weight of the body, and expi- 
ration takes place ; when he is turned on the side, 
this pressure is removed, and inspiration occurs.) 

6. When the prone position is resumed, make a 
uniform and efficient pressure along the spine, re- 
moving the pressure immediately before rotation on 
the side. (The pressure augments the expiration, 
the rotation commences inspiration.) Continue these 
measures. 

7. Rub the limbs upward with firm pressure, and 
with energy, (The effect being to aid the return of 
venous blood to the heart.) 

8. Substitute for the patient's wet clothing, if 
possible, such other covering as can be instantly 
procured, each bystander supplying a coat or cloak, 
&c. Meanwhile, and from time to time, to excite

inspiration^ let the surface of the body be slapped 
briskly with the hand. 

9. Rub the body briskly till it is dry and warm, 
then dash cold water upon it, and repeat the 
rubbing. 

Avoid the immediate removal of the patient, as it 
involves a dangerous loss of time ; also the use of 
bellows, or any forcing instrument ; also the warm 
hathy and all rough treatment.
