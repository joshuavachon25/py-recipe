and when one has been cured of a troublesome Cough, Cold, Throat or Lung affection it is impossible 
for her to be silent on the subject. In this waj' those who have been restored to health by the use of 

"BULLOCK'S THROAT <So LUNG BALSAM" 

have made its merits known far and near as the 

CDCDL-JC35I— I CDLJFREI-" 



" For weeks I suffered with a hackincr wmgh, difficulty in breathing, sharp pains and tightness across the chest. Neither the usual remedies nor a 
physician's treatment gave me relief. Bullock's Throat and Lung Balsam being so highly recommended I gave it a trial. Less than a bottle healed the 
Inngs and removed all trouble." Mrs. WARREN FILKINS, Passaic, N. J. 

" Never have I used anjihlng equal to Bullocks Throat and Lung Balsam for curing the coughs, colds, and croup, that my children have been pecul- 
iarly suhiect to. We have used it in our family for the past year for throat and lung troubles and have received excellent results.

Soups. 



Stock. — All meat and bones for soup must be put 
on in cold water, and allowed to boil slowly several 
hours. Strain the liquor and set it aside until the 
next day, when every particle of fat can be removed 
from the top. 

Send all soups to the table very hot. 

Hot Bouillon. — One pound of round of beef per- 
fectly free from fat, three pints of cold water, 
four whole peppers, two cloves, one onion, half 
of a medium sized carrot, half of a small turnip, 
half a teaspoon of celery seed. Cook all day in 
a porcelain saucepan, adding the vegetables and the 
spice the last half of the time. Strain while hot 
through a piece of cheese cloth. When cold remove 
every particle of fat, and pour off carefully all but the 



; sediment. Color slightly with a little burned sugar. 
I To be heated the last moment and served in cups, 
!with a thin slice of lemon in each cup. Mrs. W. 

Vegetable Soup. — Boil four pounds of lean beef 
in three quarts of water, for three or four hours. 
In another pan boil your vegetables. Chop together 
very finely two carrots, two turnips, half a head of 
cabbage, an onion, and two or three stalks of celery ; 
add half a cup of rice or barley; boil until tender. 
Strain the stock into the pot with the vegetables. 
Boil all together for half an hour and season to taste. 
Mrs. G. E. Dinsmore. 

P Otato Soup. — Boil four large potatoes until nearly 
done, pour off the water and add one quart of hot 



COOKS IN CLOVER. 



water. Then boil again until thoroughly dissolved, 
adding fresh boiling water as it boils away. When 
done, run it through the colander, adding three- 
fourths of a cup of hot cream, a large tablespoon 
of finely cut parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Bring | 
it to boiling and serve. Mrs. Fannie Marsellus. 

Cream of Tomato Soup. — To one can of toma- \ 
toes add one pint of boiling water and let it boill

Hash. — Rid cold corned or roast beef of fat, skin

and salt, if the beef be fresh; if corned, use the salt 
sparingly. Set a frying-pan on the stove with a 



I cup of beef gravy in it, from which you have

' will do if you have no gravy. When the gravy be- 
comes thoroughly heated, add a small half-teaspoon 
of made mustard, then put in the meat and potato, 
and stir to prevent sticking. Let this boil rapidly 
for about five minutes or until it thickens, but do not 
let it get stiff. Heap on a hot dish, and eat from hot

the chicken in the liquid while hot. After wetting

with slices of two or three hard boiled eggs, and

very small pinch of soda. This vegetable should 
( always be eaten young, as, when allowed to grow 
(too long, it tastes stringy and tough when cooked. 
J Cut off the heads and tails, and a thin strip on each 
side of the bean, then divide each bean into four or 
I six pieces according to size, cutting them length- 
') ways in a slanting direction, and, as they are cut 
drop them into cold water with a small quantity of 
i salt dissolved in it. Have ready a saucepan of boil- 
; ing water, with salt and soda in the above propor- 
j tion ; put in the beans and keep them boiling quickly 
( with the lid off. When tender, which may be ascer- 
( tained by their sinking to the bottom of the sauce-

very small pinch of soda. Pick away all the dead J 
leaves and wash the greens well in cold water, drain > 
them in a colander, and put them into fast boiling 
water with salt and soda in the above proportion. / 
Keep them boiling quickly, with the lid off, until 
tender, and the moment they are done take them 
up or their color will be spoiled. When well 
drained, serve. The great art in cooking greens 
properly and in having them of a good color, is to ', 
put them into plenty of fast boiling water, to let them 
boil very quickly and to take them up the moment 
they become tender. Young greens take ten to 
twelve minutes, sprouts twelve minutes, after the 
water boils. Mrs. A. R. B. 

New England Baked Beans. — One quart of beans \ 
soaked over night in cold water. Drain, and put in

salt and pepper to taste. Cover with luke-warm 
water, and bake twelve hours, adding water from 
time to time as it dries away. Have the oven quite 
hot at first, gradually diminishing the heat. The 
small white bean that does not fall apart in cooking 
is the best to select for this manner of preparing.

BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC. ,„ 

Johnny Cake, I. — Take a cup of corn meal, and the meal should be yellow; 
Add a cup of wheat flour, to make the meal mellow; 
Of sugar a cup, white or brown at your pleasure, 
The color is nothing; — the point is the measure. 

Now, after the sugar, the flour, and the meal. 
Comes a cup of sour cream, but, unless you should steal 
From your neighbors, I fear you would never be able 
This item to put upon your cook's table; 
For sure and indeed, in all towns I remember. 
Sour cream is as scarce as June bugs in December. 

Instead of sour cream, then, take one cup of milk ; 

Sweet milk from the dairy,— what a sweet phrase to utter I 
And to make it cream-like, put into the cup 

Just three tablespoons, and heaping, of butter. 
Of cream-tartar and soda, each a teaspoon then add. 
Or else your poor corn cake will go to the bad . 

Two eggs must be broken, without being beat, 

Then a teaspoon of salt your work will complete. 
Twenty minutes of baking are needful to bring 

To the point of perfection, this awful good thing. Bishop Williams.

of sugar, and then a layer of fruit, till the glass is 
filled. Make the layers of sugar very thick, else 
you will have a quantity left when the fruit is all 
laid in. Cover the jar close and set it in a very 
cold place. This will keep perfectly, and have the 
taste of fresh pine-apples a year afterward. 

Mrs. M. E. W.

or quarters, according to the size of the fruit ; let 
them boil until soft, and pour in the cans scalding'

of sugar to a pound of fruit, will improve them, and 
pricking them will in a measure prevent the skins 
from breaking. Mrs. M.

ciently to remove the skins. Let them boil about 
fifteen minutes ; add salt and pepper to taste, and 
put them in the cans scalding hot. Mrs. M.

spoons of water, four tablespoons of vinegar, one 
tablespoon of butter. Boil, without stirring, till it

er's sugar, the whites of two eggs well beaten ; mix 
these well together, add half a teacup of cold water, 
and two teaspoons of peppermint; roll in flat cakes, 
and put in a cool place. Miss Annie Doremus. 

Cream Walnuts. — One pound of confectioner's 
sugar, the white of one egg beaten well, one table- 
spoon of water and one teaspoon of vanilla. Mix 
these together to form a dough. Crack one pound

come out in halves. Roll a small piece of the dough 
on the hand, and then flatten it, putting half a wal- 
nut on each side. Place them on a buttered plate, 
and let them stand for a while.

nilla or rose. Pour into a tin slightly dusted with 
powdered starch, and, when cool, divide into squares; 
with a sharp knife. Miss Ivy Jones.

grated chocolate, molasses, and sugar, and a piece 
of butter half the size of an ^'g^\ stir all together,

white, light bread with a biscuit cutter, as many 
pieces as desired; place on a plate or platter, and 
put in the oven until heated ; then toast them, with- 
out burning, dip quickly in boiling water, butter

pints of water until the strength is extracted, stfain, 

and add one and a half cups of best molasses, and 

one cup of sugar, and boil down to about one quart.

Flaxseed Tea. — Pour a pint of boiling water on ) 
a tablespoon of whole flaxseed and let it stand!

throat. Mrs. V. G. C. \ 

i 

Mustard Plaster. — One part mustard, and two 
parts flour, mixed with warm water. It must not be 
thin enough to run. Spread between two pieces of 
cheese cloth, in a very much thinner layer than for 
a poultice. Keep it on from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, never long enough to blister, as a blister raised 
by mustard is very sore and difficult to heal. G. C. 



] Bread Poultice. — Soak a muslin bag filled with 
[bread crumbs in boiling water for a few minutes, 
I then squeeze gently until it does not drip. As this 
[poultice does not retain heat any length of time, 
I it should be very thick. 

Flaxseed Poultice. — Stir flaxseed meal into 
'boiling water slowly, stirring constantly to prevent 
lumps, until it becomes stiff enough not to run 
freely. It takes about a pound of meal for- a good 
sized poultice. 

Charcoal Poultice. — Mix powdered charcoal 
through either meal or bread poultice, and sprinkle 
its surface freely with the powdered charcoal. This 
is an excellent purifier for old and foul sores. 

When for any reason a poultice cannot be had as 
soon as desired, flannel cloths wrung out in hot 
water, and renewed every few minutes are very 
effective. Grace Crane.

MISCELLANEOUS. 

Flowers grow particularly well in the kitchen, 
where the heat is even, the air moistened by the 
steam, and the sun seldom shut out. 

If applied immediately, powdered starch will ab- 
sorb most of the fruit stains from table linen. 

A little borax in the water will prevent red and . 
blue bordered table linen and towels from running. < 

A little kerosene on a flannel answers nicely to 
rub tip furniture. 

To take out an old window pane, heat a poker, 
run it slowly along the old putty and soften it loose. 

When lamps cease to give a good light, boil the 
burners half an hour, using a good teaspoon of 
washing soda, rinse and dry.
