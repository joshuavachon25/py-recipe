CHOICE RECEIPTS,

Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1874, 

BY JAMES R. OSGOOD & CO., 
the office of the Librarian of Congress, at Washington. 



University Press : Welch, Bigelow, & Co. 
Cambridge. 



This volume differs in one important respect 
from numerous cook-books, — every receipt here 
given will bear the test of experiment. There 
are receipts and receipts, as every mistress of a 
menage knows to her sorrow. There are some 
that read well, but — like Dora's sums in "Da- 
vid Copperfield " — they don't come out right ; 
there are others that are failures even when 
they are successful. In preparing this collection, 
the writer has accepted nothing from tradition ; 
she has gone to the kitchen rather than to M. 
Blot or M. Francatelli for her data ; each re- 
ceipt is the practical result of repeated trials 
by several hands, and, like a proverb, represents 
the wit of many. 



Often, in turning over some regulation manual 
of cookery, with its four or five hundred dis- 
tracting and disappointing pages, the writer has 
longed for a compact hand-book containing none 
but reliable and choice receipts for every-day use. 
When she began making these memoranda, it 
was with no view of serving any one except her- 
self; but the constant applications she has had 
for copies of this or that receipt have suggested 
to her the expediency of printing them. If the 
compilation prove half as serviceable to other 
American housekeepers as it has proved to the 
writer, her very moderate ambition as an author 
will be satisfied.

The great object in making a good salad is not to have

thrown. When they are cold, cut them up very fine, dis- 
carding all the very dark meat, such as legs, etc. Add

rich sweet cream to thoroughly moisten the chicken, but

raw eggs. Rub them thoroughly with a silver fork. Add 
to them as much mustard as is thought necessary, a very 
little sugar, and a soupc,on of cayenne pepper, also salt. 
Then add slowly, drop by drop, stirring all the while one 
way, fine, pure Lucca oil. (A good-sized dish of salad 
will require at least a large-sized bottle of oil.) If the 
oil is added slowly enough, it will become very thick, 
without the appearance of oil about it. Just before it is 
done, add vinegar to taste. Then mix a portion of the 
dressing with the chicken and lettuce (the lettuce hav- 
ing previously been broken fine with the fingers, not cut). 
Pour the remainder of the dressing over the chicken after 
it has been placed on the dish in which it is to be served. 
Garnish it with slices of hard-boiled eggs, olives with the 
pits taken out, and bits of pickled beets cut in fancy 
forms.
