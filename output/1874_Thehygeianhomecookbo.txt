HE work now offered to the public is an explanation of 
our mode of cooking at "Hygeian Home." More 
than twenty years ago the " Hydropathic Cook Book " 
was published, as an exposition of the theory and 
practice of cookery adapted to that age and stage of the Dietetic 
Reformation ; and that work is still commended to those who 
desire a more complete treatise on diet, with a plan for plain and 
wholesome cooking. 

But for a dozen years past our table for invalids has been pre- 
pared without the employment of milk, sugar, salt, yeast, acids, 
alkalies, grease, or condiments of any kind. Our only seasonings 
have been fruits and other foods in a normal state, so prepared and 
combined as to produce the requisite flavor to please without 
perverting the taste. 

As our institution stands alone among all the real or pretended 
health institutions in the world in this respect, we have taken much 
pains and made many experiments to improve every article and 
perfect every dish ; and we have reason to believe that all persons 
who desire pure and palatable food, and who wish to "eat to live," 
will find ample directions in this little volume. 

Among the special advantages of the plan we have adopted, so 
far as invalids are concerned, is the absence of sour stomach, bilious- 
ness, and constipation, so troublesome to all dyspeptics who use

milk and sugar. Nor do our patients have any desire to drink at 
meals. Pure food never occasions thirst ; and all physiologists 
know that taking water with food renders digestion and assimila- 
tion imperfect in all persons, and seriously interferes with the re- 
covery of health by invalids. 

As we use no seasonings, they are not mentioned in our recipes. 
But those who cannot change at once from high-seasoned to un- 
seasoned food, may season to suit with anything they please, re- 
collecting that the rule of health always is, the less the better. The 
recipes are good in their own merits ; and it is for the reader to 
choose what concessions he will make to habit or vitiated appe- 
tences. He may be assured, however, that a little perseverance in 
the use of unseasoned food will generally soon restore the normal 
sensibilities, so that the purest food will be the most palatable.

CHAPTSR I. 
BREADS. 

GENERAL RULES. 

ERFECT bread is made of the meal of any 
kind of grain and pure water. It may be 
rendered as light, crisp, and tender as de- 
sirable by kneading or otherwise working at- 
mospheric air into the dough. Water of any tempera- 
ture may be employed in making the dough. Hot or 
boiling water renders the bread softer and damper, cool 
and cold water renders it more dry and brittle. But 
for the best possible article the water cannot be too cold. 
Iced-water renders the bread tender and most delicious, 
if the kneading is well managed. 

Excellent bread may be made of wheat-meal, rye- 
meal, corn-meal, oat-meal, or of various admixtures of 
them, to please the fancy or suit the taste. Those who 
employ wheat-meal exclusively should see that the grain 
be plump., clean, and properly ground. In grinding it 
should be finely comminuted, or cut into small particles 
by s^arp stones or hand mills. If ground with dull 
stones the branny portion will be rubbed off in flakes, 



10 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

and good light bread cannot be made of the article. 
The white wheat is more easily managed than the red, 
and makes a handsomer appearance on the table, al- 
though I cannot say that it is more wholesome than the 
red. 

It is very important that the meal be freshly ground, 
as all meal or flour deteriorates continually. We have 
it fresh from the mill twice a week. Private families 
with hand mills can grind it fresh every day. 



PREMIUM BREAD. 

Mix unbolted wheat-meal (Graham flour) with pure 
cold water — the colder the better — to a stiff dough; 
knead thoroughly ten or fifteen minutes, or until the 
dough becomes elastic and spongy, and does not re- 
quire the bread-board longer to be dusted with flour to 
prevent sticking as it is rolled out. For baking the 
dough may be rolled out and out into various forms, 4o 
suit taste or convenience. It may be made into rolls, 
squares, strips, rings, "diamonds," " fingers," etc., the 
object in all cases being to expose as much of the 
surface as possible to the heat of the oven. 

The rolls and "fingers" are made three ox four inches 
long and three-fourths of an inch thick ; squares and 
diamonds are one to two inches in diameter (these re- 
quire pricking), and one-half to three-fourths of an inch 
thick ; strips may be three or four inches long, one inch 
wide, and one-fourth of an inch thick ; rings are made 



BREADS. II 

by cutting out a circle of dough one-half to three-fourths 
of an inch in thickness, and three inches in diameter, 
then cutting out a ball from the centre of the circle one 
inch in diameter. The rings and balls present a beau- 
tiful appearance on the table, and no shape in which 
dough can be cut is in better condition for baking. 

For baking, a quick oven is required. The bread 
should be placed immediately on the grates of the oven, 
never on tins ; it should be placed in the hottest part of 
the oven at first, and removed back a little as soon as a 
crust is formed. Care must be taken to have the dough 
thoroughly baked, or it will become heavy when cold. 
The time required for baking is twenty to forty minutes, 
according to the size of the bread and the heat of the 
oven. When well done the bread has an elastic or 
spongy feeling. 



COLD-WATER LOAF-BREAD. 

This is mixed and kneaded in the same manner as 
the " Premium" bread ; but is molded in a larger form,, 
and baked in a more moderate heat, to insure its being 
thoroughly done in the centre, without burning the 
outside. It is usually made in loaves two-and-a-half to 
three-and-a-half inches thick, and of any length desired. 
It should be in the oven about one hour. If the crust 
is too hard, cover it in an earthen jar, or envelop it close- 
ly in a linen cloth until cold, when it is ready for the 
table. It should never be cut while hot. 



12 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

HOT WATER ROLLS. 
This is commonly called "soft bread." It is made 
by pouring boiling water over wheat-meal, and stirring 
with a strong spoon to a stiff dough ; then kneaded 
quickly and rolled out into any desired form ; " rolls " 
and "diamonds," are the best forms for this kind of 
bread. This bread has a very sweet flavor, and ' ' new 
beginners " are very fond of it. 



HOT WATER LOAF BREAD. 

This is made in the same manner as the preceding, 
except that it is molded into long loaves, three or four 
inches thick. It requires baking* about one hour in a 
moderate oven. 



MUSH ROLLS. 

These are made light, spongy, and soft enough for 
toothless persons, by mixing with cold mush of any 
kind, sufficient meal to form a soft dough ; then rolled 
to the size of the thumb, and baked in a hot oven twenty 
or thirty minutes. A few English currants may be added 
to render them more palatable. 



GEMS. 



Stir into the coldest water any kind of meal and mix 
to a stiff batter, yet so that it may lift with a spoon and 



BREADS. 13 

settle smooth of itself ; drop immediately into hot gem 
pans (iron are best) ; let them stand on the top of the 
stove a few minutes, then bake in a hot oven thirty or 
forty minutes. When done they should be light and 
dry when broken. If mushy on the inside the batter 
was not thick enough. If the gem pans are hot and 
kept smooth no greasing is necessary. 



FRUIT GEMS. 

These are made in the same manner as the preceding, 
with the addition of any kind of dried fruit that may be 
preferred. Seedless currants, thoroughly washed and 
soaked in a very little water, or raisins stoned and stewed 
soft, are commonly preferred. The addition of a little 
grated cocoanut, makes an article of food which is 
simple, wholesome, and luxurious. 



WHEAT-MEAL CRISPS. 

Make a dough as for "Premium Bread;" roll to the 
thickness of a table knife blade ; cut in any desired 
form ; prick with a fork ; put it on the grate in a hot 
oven, and watch closely to see that it becomes cooked 
and crisp without being browned. If well managed 
these crisps are delicious, very tender, and well adapted 
to those who have poor teeth. 



14 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

OAT-MEAL CRISPS. 

These maybe made of oat-meal or oat-meal mush, 
mixed with boiling water to a stiff dough ; then kneaded 
a little ; mixed with a little wheat-meal to prevent its 
crumbling; moulded, cut into small thin cakes, and 
baked twenty or thirty minutes in a hot oven. If made 
very thin, and kept in a cool, dry place, they will retain 
a rich flavor for several days. 



COCOANUT BREAD. 

Add to three quarts of wheat-meal one grated cocoanut 
(or in that proportion); mix with water to a stiff dough ; 
knead till the dough becomes spongy ; mold into any 
desired form, and bake in a hot oven twenty to thirty 
minutes. This bread is a great favorite on festive occa- 
sions. 



FRUIT BREAD. 
Make a dough as for either of the first three kinds of 
bread ; roll out the dough on the bread-board of any 
thickness desired ; cover this with a mixture of the fol- 
lowing fruits, or with either one or more of them : 
stoned raisins, stoned dates, English currants, and 
stewed figs ; cocoanut may be grated over the fruit 
if its flavor is also desired ; turn the dough over the 
fruit, and roll up tightly into a loaf, and bake in a hot 
oven. If made with cold water, as in " Premium" 



BREADS. 15 

bread, it may be rolled in a cloth and steamed two or 
three hours. This is regarded as a very rich and savory 
dish, and also wholesome. 



SWEET POTATO BREAD. 

Boil sweet potatoes with the skins on, peal and mash 
through a colander ; mix with an equal quantity of 
wheat-meal; if too moist add more wheat-mea! ; if too 
dry add a little boiling water ; knead together quickly as 
for "Hot Water " bread, or roll it into "Diamonds," 
and bake in a quick oven. 



SWEET POTATO FRUIT BREAD. 

Make a dough as in the preceding recipe, adding 
grated cocoanut if desired ; roll out thin and spread on 
any one or more kinds of fruit (raisins and figs are 
sufficient), mentioned in the recipe for " Fruit Bread ;" 
make into a loaf and bake in a quick oven. 



WHITE POTATO BREAD. 

Wash and peel the potatoes ; boil them in as little 
water as will cover them ; mash them through a col- 
ander with the water in which they were boiled ; heat 
the whole to the boiling point ; mix in wheat-meal until 
sufficiently stiff to knead ; cut into small cakes and 
bake in a hot oven. The flavor usually preferred is 
secured by using three parts of meal to one of potatoes. 



l6 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

FANCY BREADS. 

Make " Sweet Potato Bread" as already mentioned ; 
roll thin and cut into fanciful shapes with cake cutters, 
or make a dough as for "Premium Bread," adding 
freely of grated cocoanut, and roll thin and cut into any 
desirable forms ; bake in a hot oven. 



PUMPKIN BREAD. 

Stew pumpkin very dry and mix with wheat-meal to a 
rather soft dough ; make the dough into the shape of 
loaf bread, diamonds, rolls, or roll thin and divide into 
pieces with cake cutters. 



APPLE BREAD. 



This is made precisely as the preceding, substituting 
apple sauce for pumpkin. Sweet apples, and those of a 
mild acid flavor, are the best for this kind of bread. 



SNOW BREAD. 

Mix thoroughly together two parts of dry, clean snow, 
and one part of corn meal ; turn the mass into an iron 
baking pan, and bake in a very hot oven. The bread 
should be one to one and a half inches in thickness. 



CORN AND GRAHAM BREAD. 
Take cold corn meal mush, and knead wheat-meal 



BREADS. 17 

into it till the mass becomes a soft dough ; shape it into 
a loaf, or into " diamonds," and bake in a hot oven, as 
long as possible without burning the crust. 



FARINA AND GRAHAM BREAD. 

Cold boiled farina and wheat-meal may be made into 
nice bread, in the manner of the preceding recipe. It 
does not require baking so long. 



RYE AND INDIAN BREAD. 

Mix two parts corn meal and one part rye-meal ; pour 
on boiling water enough to wet the whole ; pack it into 
a pan and steam five or six hours, then set it into the 
oven to brown. Raisins, dates, currants, or other fruits, 
may be added to this kind of bread, if desired. 



MIXED MEAL BREAD. 

Take one part each of rye flour, wheat-meal, and 
oat-meal, and three parts of corn-meal ; mix thoroughly ; 
pour on boiling water enough to scald all the meal ; 
pack into a pan and steam six or seven hours. Before 
sending to the table it should be browned in the oven. 
Prunes, raisins, dates or currants mav be added to this 
kind of bread. 



PLAIN JOHNNY CAKE. 

Wet corn-meal with either hot or cold water, pack it 
one inch thick in a baking pan, and bake in a hot oven. 



18 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

PUMPKIN JOHNNY CAKE. 

Take pumpkin stewed until it is very dry and sweet, 
and stir corn meal into it until the mass becomes a 
rather stiff dough ; spread it on a baking pan on which 
dry meal has been sifted, and bake in a hot oven. 



RYE BREAD. 
Pour boiling water on rye-flour or rye-meal, and mix 
into a stiff dough ; make it into loaves about three inches 
in diameter, or cut into squares or rolls, and bake in a 
hot oven. 



OAT-MEAL BREAD. 
Take oat-meal mush and knead in dry oat-meal ; roll 
out to the thickness of one quarter of an inch, and cut 
with a cake cutter, or roll thin as a knife blade ; bake as 
crisps. Boiling water may be poured on the uncooked 
oat-meal instead of using the mush. 



BROWN BREAD. 

Scald two parts of corn-meal, let it stand one or two 
hours ; add two parts of rye and one of wheat-meal ; 
mix thoroughly, and as stiff as can be stirred with a 
strong iron spoon ; add raisins or currants if desired, 
and steam five or six hours ; then place it in a moderate 
oven two hours. It mav be served warm or cold. 



BREADS. 19 

BERRY SHORT CAKE. 

Mix water (the colder the better), wheat-meal, and a 
little grated cocoanut, so as to form a stiff batter ; drop 
the batter in hot bread pans three-fourths of an inch 
thick ; bake in a hot oven ; when cold, split open, lay 
each half crust down, and cover with ripe strawberries, 
raspberries, blackberries or whortleberries. Good ripe 
peaches will answer in place of berries. Any of the fruit 
sauces, mentioned in another chapter, may be added if 
desired, on serving the dish. 



CORN DODGERS. 

Mix corn meal and the coldest water to a stiff dough ; 
mold into small cakes of an oval shape ; place in hot 
pans previously dusted with meal ; smooth the top with 
the hands dipped in water, and bake in a hot oven one 
hour. 



RICE CAKES. 

Take two parts of boiled rice, one part of corn meal, 
and one part of stoned or seedless raisins chopped fine ; 
mix with water to a soft dough, roll into small cakes, 
and bake in a pan dusted with meal to prevent sticking. 
It should remain in the oven until a crust is formed. 



BERRY TOAST. 
Toast thin slices of Graham bread, dip them in hot 



20 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

water, and cover with hot stewed berries. Blackberries 
and whortleberries are commonly preferred. 



APPLE TOAST. 

Apple sauce or stewed apples may be employed in the 
same manner as berries. If very tart, dates may be used 
to sweeten. 



RHUBARB TOAST. 

Peel, and cut the stalks in pieces, put them in a stew 
pan, add a little water, some stoned dates, and a few 
English currants well picked and washed ; let them all 
cook until done, and then pour them over the toasted 
bread. 



WHOLE GRAINS AND SEEDS. 

These may be roasted over burning coals, or on a hot 
stove, if placed in a "corn-popper" and shaken con- 
stantly ; or boiled until soft. Wheat and rice are the 
favorite grains for boiling, and corn for roasting 01 
"popping." 



CHAPTER IX. 
MUSHES. 

GENERAL RULES. 



USHES of all kinds should be stirred as little 
as possible while cooking, after the material 
sets, or stops sinking, to the bottom. Much 
stirring breaks up the particles and frees the 
starchy matter, rendering the food pasty, and destroying 
the light, spongy, delicate appearance it should present 
on the table; too much stirring also makes it more 
liable to adhere to the bottom of the vessel. The 
water should boil when the meal or grain is stirred in, 
be kept boiling, and the mush stirred frequently for a 
few minutes, when it will cease sinking ; then cover 
closely and cook slowly for an hour or more. Mushes 
should not be too thick, nor so thin as to spread much 
on the plate when dished. The tendency of fruit when 
cooked in mushes is to settle and adhere to the kettle ; 
hence in adding fruit, the better way, as a general rule, 
is to cook it separately and mix just before dishing. The 
fruit for this purpose should always be cooked slowly 
and in as little water as possible. 



22 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

CRUSHED WHEAT MUSH. 

As the grits swell very much in cooking, they should 
be stirred gradually into boiling water until a thin mush 
is formed ; the boiling should be continued slowly for 
two or three hours ; the coarser the grits the longer they 
should be boiled. Raisins may be cooked with it for a 
seasoning, or stoned dates may be added after it is 
cooked. 



CORN GRITS. 

In this market this is prepared from white corn, 
which is cut into coarser or finer particles of nearly 
uniform size ; the coarser kind is called samp. It is 
cooked in the same manner as wheaten grits (crushed 
wheat — cracked wheat), and requires boiling from one to 
two hours, according to the size of the grits. 



HOMINY. 

This is very coarse corn grits, the grains of corn 
being broken into coarse pieces. It should be washed 
several times ; soaked over night, then boiled in the 
same water four or five hours. Raisins give this dish a 
very rich flavor. 



FARINA. 
This should be gradually stirred into hot water ; a 
small quantity will cook in half an hour, but larger 



MUSHES. 23 

quantities require boiling slowly one or two hours. 
Grated cocoanut gives it a fine flavor. 



OAT-MEAL MUSH. 

Put into your kettle nearly as much water as you wish 
mush ; when it boils stir in the oat-meal evenly until a 
thin mush is formed ; then cover and let it boil slowly 
half to three-fourths of an hour. 



CORN-MEAL MUSH 

This is made in the same manner as oat-meal mush, 
but is improved by longer cooking. The coarser the 
meal the longer it should be cooked. Very fine meal 
does not make good mush. English currants or raisins 
may be cooked with it. Sliced sweet apples may be 
cooked in it by spreading them near the surface, an 
hour before it is done. 



GRAHAM MUSH. 

This is made of Graham-flour (wheat-meal) and hot 
water, in the same manner as oat-meal mush ; but re- 
quires cooking only about twenty minutes ; care is 
required in stirring it not to have it lumpy. Stoned 
dates make the best seasoning. 

RYE MUSH. 

This is made in the same manner as Graham mush ; 
it is not so palatable as the other mushes. 



24 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

BERRY MUSH. 

Pick and wash the berries; stew them in a little 
water, adding a few stoned dates, stirring frequently 
until well cooked ; then stir in very evenly a little Graham 
flour or oat-meal. Blackberries, raspberries, or whortle- 
berries may be used. 



RICE MUSH. 

Wash the rice and boil it until the grains are soft ; do 
not stir it ; when done uncover and let the steam escape. 
Raisins are the proper fruit when seasoning is desired. 

A convenient method of cooking fruited rice mush is, 
to put the washed rice into a wet bag, rilling about one- 
fourth of it (mixing raisins if desired), and then boil or 
steam it. 



OiHI^IF'TIEiF*- III. 

PIES. 

GENERAL RULES. 

HE chief difficulty in making Hygienic pies is, 
to have the crust soft and tender without yeast 
or grease. But this can be done in various 
ways, and of various materials. But however 
made and however tender, they can all be rendered 
still more so by covering them in a stone crock, or, 
better still, with a few folds of linen cloth, so that the 
crust will absorb the moisture of the contents. The 
following recipes for making crust will suit nearly all 
tastes and circumstances. 




GRAHAM PIE CRUST. 

Pour boiling water into wheat-meal and stir to a soft 
dough ; roll out as thin as possible ; sprinkle a little 
meal over the pie plate, and spread this as the bottom 
crust. Make the top crust by mixing wheat-meal with 
ice-cold water ; add grated cocoanut if desired ; knead 
as quickly as possible co a stiff hard dough ; roll very 
thin ; cover and bake immediately. 



26 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

MUSH PIE CRUST. 

Take any coid mush — wheat-meal, cold boiled rice, 
corn-meal, or oat-meal, or any mixture of them ; knead 
a little wheat-meal into it and roll thin, making the 
upper and under crusts alike. If there is only mush 
enough for one crust, the top crust may be made accord- 
ing to the preceding recipe. 



OAT-MEAL PIE CRUST. 

Scald two parts of oat-meal with one part water, and 
roll thin. This crust bakes very quickly, so that fruit 
which requires much cooking should be cooked before 
making into the pie. 



POTATO PIE CRUST. 



Boil dry mealy potatoes ; sift through a colander ; 
mix them thoroughly with one-half the quantity ; add 
boiling water equal to about one-fourth the bulk of the 
mixture ■ roll thin, and bake in a moderate oven. 



CORN-MEAL PIE CRUST. 

A very tender crust for squash, pumpkin, or custard 
pies, may be made by placing dry corn-meal on the 
bottom of the dish. 



COCOANUT PIE CRUST. 

A rich and very delicious pie crust may be made as 
follows : mix one part grated cocoanut with two parts 



PIES. 27 

Graham flour, and water (the colder the better) suffi- 
cient to make a stiff dough ; knead five minutes, then 
add one part of boiled rice and mix thoroughly 



APPLE PIE. 
Make a crust according to either of the above recipes 
except the last ; spread the bottom crust on the plate ; 
on this sDread a few dates, stoned and cut into small 
pieces ; sift a little meal over this, and lay on the apples 
in slices or stewed ; if the fruit is very juicy sift on more 
meal ; cover with the top crust ; have the fruit extend 
close to the edges of the crust, which should be wet so 
that the top and bottom crust will adhere at their edges ; 
with a knife roll the edges under so that they will be 
smooth ; bake immediately, being careful not to have 
the top crust much browned. As soon as done, cover 
tight with a dish about two inches deep, and let it steam 
till cold, when the crust will be very tender. 



BERRY PIE. 

This may be made in the same manner as apple pie, 
using blackberries, raspberries or whortleberries instead 
of apples. It requires more dates than apple pie does 
for sweetening, unless the berries are very ripe. 



CRANBERRY PIE. 

This is also made in the same manner as the pre- 
ceding, only two or three times the quantity of dates are 



28 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

required. A top crust may be used or not ; or narrow 
strips of a thin crust may be laid across. If no top 
crust is used it will not need to be covered when done. 



RHUBARB PIE. 

Peel the stalks and cut into small pieces, putting 
dates both below and above them. 



PUMPKIN PIE. 

Stew the pumpkin according to the recipe in this work 
for so doing ; when nearly dry and quite rich, it is ready 
for the pie. Mix two parts of corn-meal and one part 
of Graham flour ; sift the mixture over a pie plate to the 
depth of an eighth of an inch ; upon this spread a layer 
of the stewed pumpkin, and on this lay stoned raisins ; 
cover with another layer of pumpkin- and bake in a 
moderate oven. Dates may be used instead of raisins, if 
preferred. They should be stewed and put through the 
colander. 



STEWED APPLE PIE. 

This may be made according to the recipe for pump- 
kin pie, omitting the top crust. 



PEACH PIE. 
This is made in the same manner as apple pie. 



PIES. 2 9 

PEAR PIE. 
• This may be made in the same manner as the pre- 
ceding. 

DRIED FRUIT PIES. 
Nearly all kinds of dried fruits may be made into pies 
in the same manner as green fruit, first stewing the fruit. 
It is better to mash the fruit through the colander, and 
make the pie after the recipe for pumpkin pie. 

COCO-CUSTARD PIE. 
Make an under crust according to the recipe for 
cocoanut pie crust, and fill with stewed pumpkin or 
squash, sweetened with a little date sauce. Other stewed 
fruits may be used, as apples, peaches, raisins or berries. 
This pie is improved by the addition of a little lemon 
juice. 

TARTS. 
Mix Graham flour plentifully with grated cocoanut ; 
pour into the mixture ice-water enough to make a stiff 
dough ; knead it hard ; roll very thin and cut into round 
cakes two or three inches in diameter ; cut out the 
centre of a part of them, leaving a narrow rim ; put three 
layers of these rims on one centre or round piece, wet- 
ting them so as to make them unite; prick the centre 
with a fork and bake in a quick oven, yet not so as to 



30 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

brown them. They should be crisp and tender when 
done. When wanted for use they have only to be filled 
with some kind of fruit sauce, as stewed English currants, 
pineapple, marmalade, etc. 



DUMPLINGS. 

Make a crust of wheat-meal, water, and grated cocoa- 
nut, thoroughly kneaded as for " Premium Bread ;" 
roll out quickly a small piece of the dough, a little 
thicker than for pie crust ; press it into a tea cup with 
the hand ; fill with sliced tart apples, peaches, whortle- 
berries, or other fruit ; press together ; bake in a mod- 
erate oven one hour, and serve with sauce. Dates and 
raisins may be employed to sweeten when apples 01 
other tart fruits are used. 



OHAPTBR. XV- 
PUDDINGS. 

GENERAL RULES. 

UDDINGS are intermediate between mushes 
and pastry. They are substantially baked 
mushes, or pies with the crust and contents 
intimately interblended. The principal skill 
required in producing hygienic puddings, consists in 
selecting such materials as will, when cooked, present a 
light spongy mass, and such seasoning ingredients as 
will render them palatable without impairing their diges- 
tivity. Puddings and mushes should always be eaten 
very slowly and with dry cracker, hard bread, or other 
solid food, to insure proper mastication. 




HYGIENIC BROWN BETTY. 
Prepare a quantity of apples for stewing, cleanse some 
raisins and currants, and stone some dates ; the propor- 
tions may be according to taste or fancy ; cut some 
Graham bread into thin slices; put into the stewing 
kettle a layer of the fruits ; then a layer of bread, repeat- 
ing and alternating until the kettle is nearly full, or 



32 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

until a sufficient quantity is prepared ; then pou> on 
cold water until it reaches within two inches of the top 
of the pudding ; set it where it will simmer slowly with- 
out burning ; cook until the bread and fruit are tho- 
roughly soft, when the liquor will be very rich ; serve 
warm or cold. Grated cocoanut may be added if its 
flavor is desired. 



INDIAN PUDDING. 

Prepare apples for stewing, and stone some dates ; put 
Indian-meal into the baking, and pour boiling water into 
it enough to make a thin mush. Add the apples and 
dates, grated cocoanut if desired, and bake five or six 
hours. Raisins and figs may be employed wi-th the 
other fruits, or instead of them. It may be served with a 
dressing of stewed English currants, or stewed figs, but 
is excellent without any sauce. 



CORN MUSH PUDDING. 

Early in the morning make a mush of corn-meal, 
stirring it very thick ; place it where it will simmer 
slowly and not burn ; let it cook seven or eight hours ; 
an hour before done add as many raisins as may be de- 
sired ; just before removing from the fire stir in grated 
cocoanut enough to flavor well ; put it into molds to 
cool. It should be served the next day, with or without 
a dressing of currant or fig sauce. 



PUDDINGS. 33 

SWEET POTATO PUDDING. 
Grate half a dozen raw sweet potatoes ; mix them 
with two quarts of green apple juice ; add sufficient 
grated cocoanut to flavor, and raisins if desired ; then 
mix with Graham flour enough ro make a batter of the 
proper consistency for gems ; bake in a pudding dish, 
or in gem pans. The batter needs beating, and the 
apple juice should be as cold as possible. 

BIRDS' NEST PUDDING. 
Put into the bottom of the pudding dish a few stoned 
raisins ; fill two-thirds full with quartered apples— or 
the apples may be cored whole, and the cavity filled with 
the raisins ; make a batter as for gems, adding grated 
cocoanut ; pour the batter over the apples and bake in a 
moderate oven. When done loosen the edges of the 
crust, and turn it upper side down on a plate. Cur- 
rant sauce is a good dressing. 

BAKED APPLE PUDDING. 
Boil good apples, with dates enough to sweeten them, 
in about one-fifth their bulk of water. Put all through 
a colander; stir in some grated bread crumbs, and a 
few drops of lemon juice ; bake about forty minutes. 

SWEET APPLE PUDDING. 
Pare and core good ripe sweet apples ; fill the centre 
of each with raisins s.nd cranberries ; put them into 



34 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

boiling water into which Indian-meal has been stirred 
to the consistence of thin mush ; bake about three 
hours. If the apples are not very sweet a few dates 
will give the requisite flavor, added to the cranberries 
and raisins. 



RICE AND APPLE PUDDING. 

Boil the rice until it is soft, half fill the pudding disn 
with peeled and cored apples whose cavities have been 
filled with dates ; put the rice over the fruit as a crust, 
and bake one hour. 



SNOW-BALL PUDDING. 

Pare and core large mellow apples ; fill the cavities 
with dates or raisins ; inclose them in cloths spread 
over with boiled rice ; bake one hour. Before turning 
them out they should be dipped in cold water. Stewed 
currants or figs make a good sauce for this kind of pud- 
ding. 



STEAMED PUDDING. 

Mix three parts of bread or crackers cut into small 
pieces, one part tart apples cut in small pieces, and one 
part dried sweet fruit — raisins, dates, figs, or a mixture 
of them, chopped fine ; add sufficient water to prevent 
the pudding drying while cooking ; mix thoroughly and 
steam four or five hours, according to quantity.

SAUCES. 
GENERAL RULES. 

ERSONS whose ideas of sauces as dressings 
or relishes for food, are limited to combina- 
tions of butter, sugar, salt, vinegar, and 
spices, may be astonished to learn what vari- 



eties of wholesome as well as palatable articles can be 
made by combinations of fruits and their juices. The 
number is practically unlimited, but Hygienists 
usually have or soon acquire appetences so nearly nor- 
mal that they are satisfied with few. All that is required 
to make a wholesome and palatable sauce or dressing, 
is a selection of fruits that are themselves wholesome, 
and such admixtures and preparations of them as will 
suit the taste. The following recipes are favorite speci- 
mens. 

COCOANUT SAUCE. 
Stew equal parts of chopped figs, raisins and English 
currants for an hour in water sufficient to cover them ; 
when nearly done add grated cocoanut in quantity to 



36 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

suit the taste, and a little Graham flour to thicken. An 
excellent sauce maybe made by adding grated cocoa-nut 
to date sauce. 



DATE SAUCE. 

Boil the dates for an hour, or until tender, in water 
enough to cover them ; sift through a colander, rejecting 
such portions as will not pass ; stir thoroughly, adding 
more water if too thick, and boil again ; if too sweet 
acid fruit of any kind, boiled and passed through a col- 
ander, may be added before it is boiled the last time. 
Dried or canned fruits may be used with the dates ; or 
the juices of canned fruits may be added without passing 
through the colander. 



LEMON SAUCE. 

This is made in the same manner as date sauce, 
omitting all fruits, except the dates, and adding the 
grated peel of lemon sufficient for the flavor desired. 
Grate the peel before the lemon is cut, and care should 
be taken to grate only the yellow part, as the white part 
is bitter and indigestible. 



APPLE AND TOMATO SAUCE. 

Boil good ripe tomatoes, which have been scalded and 
peeled, fifteen to twenty minutes; then add an equal 
quantity of sliced apples, and cook until the apples are 
soft. 



sauces. 37 

dried fruit sauce. 

All kinds of fruit, or mixtures of them, cooked until 
well done and properly thinned with water, make good 
dressings, or sauces for puddings and mushes. 



GRAPE AND APPLE SAUCE. 

Equal parts of stewed grapes and sweet apples, strained 
through a thin cloth, and thickened with a little rice or 
Graham flour, make a rich sauce for rice, hominy, samp, 
and other mushes. Sour apples and dates may be used 
instead of sweet apples. 



ORANGE SAUCE. 

This is made in the same manner as the above, sub- 
stituting orange for lemon, and adding some acid fruit 
when the orange juice is not sufficiently tart. 



CURRANT SAUCE. 

Pick and wash English currants very carefully, then 
stew a few minutes, and serve cold. 



FIG SAUCE. 
Wash the figs ; chop them coarse, and stew in water 
enough to make the sauce of the requisite consistence. 



SAUCE FOR SHORT CAKE. 
Stew dates and rub them through a colander ; set the 
liquid over the fire, and when boiling thicken with a 



'38 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOX. 

little Graham flour or farina, wet with berry juice. Or 
chop figs into small pieces ; stew in a small quantity of 
water; strain, and it is ready for use. 

This sauce is intended specially for strawberry short- 
cake, but will answer for berry cakes of all kinds. 

Note. — The above sauces or dressings may be used indiscrimi- 
nately with crushed wheat, rice, hominy, oat -meal, all kinds of 
mushes, steamed puddings, berry cakes, etc. Either of them is an 
excellent relish for any dish for which any dressing is desired ; but 
we have indicated such preferences as experience in providing for a 
great variety of tastes and habits has suggested. 




CXH^^TIE^ VI. 
SOUPS. 

GENERAL RULES. 

YGIENIC soups consist of one or more vege- 
tables boiled very soft, and equally diffused 
through a large proportion of water. If 
eaten with bread, cracker, uncooked fruit, or 
other solid food, they are not objectionable as slop food. 
They are usually made of varying proportions of pota- 
toes, peas, beans, carrots, turnips, beets, parsnips, etc., 
and sometimes flavored with tomatoes. The following 
varieties are favorites with us. 






VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Take three medium-sized turnips, a small head of 
cabbage, four or five medium-sized carrots, three me- 
dium-sized parsnips, and three quarts of pared potatoes ; 
chop all of the vegetables except the potatoes very fine ; 
put them in three quarts of water ; boil them till nearly 
done ; then add the potatoes and cook until they are 
reduced to a pulp. A small quantity of tomatoes may 
be added, or not, as preferred. Beans and peas added 
to vegetable soup increases its richness. 



40 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Scald and peel good ripe tomatoes ; stew them one 
hour ; strain through a coarse sieve ; add grated pota- 
toes to thicken sufficiently, and cook half an hour longer. 



SPLIT PEA SOUP. 

Wash one pint of split peas, and boil in three quarts 
of. water three hours. 



BEAN SOUP. 
Wash the beans ; put them in cold water and raise 
the temperature slowly to the b oiling point ; add water 
enough to have the soup of the thickness desired ; boil 
until the beans* are softened ; press them through a col- 
ander, and boil for a minute or two. Sago, soaked, 
may then be added if desired. 



GREEN BEAN SOUP. 

Boil one quart of garden or kidney beans, and put 
them through the colander ; add an equal quantity of 
vegetable broth ; dredge in a little Graham flour or oat- 
meal ; stir the dish until it boils ; then add one ounce 
of spinach and one ounce of parsley, chopped fine ; scald 
till these are done,, and send to the table. 



GREEN PEA SOUP. 
Take three pints of peas ; three medium-sized turnips, 
one carrot, and the pods of the peas ; boil one quart of 



SOUPS. 4 1 

the largest of the peas with the pods until they are quite 
soft ; rub them through a fine colander : return the 
pulp into the pan ; add the turnips, the carrot, sliced, 
and a quart of boiling water ; when the vegetables are 
nearly soft, add the smaller peas. Potatoes may be used 
instead of turnips. 



SPINACH SOUP. 

Take two quarts of spinach, half a pound of parsley, 
two carrots, two turnips, and one root of celery ; stew 
all of them in a pint of water until quite soft ; rub them 
through a coarse sieve ; add one quart of hot water and 
boil them twenty minutes. 



VEGETABLE AND RICE SOUP. 

Take one pound of turnips, half a pound of carrots, 
one-fourth of a pound of parsnips, half a pound of pota- 
toes, and three tablespoonsful of rice ; chop the vege- 
tables fine ; put the turnips, carrots, and parsnips into a 
pan with a quart of boiling water ; add the rice ; boil 
them one hour ; add the potatoes and two quarts of 
water, and boil them until they are all well done. 



POTATO SOUP. 

Wash and pare, but do not cut, the potatoes, put them 
in a little more than enough of boiling water to cover 
them; if any lumps remain after boiling pass them 



42 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

through a colander. This soup is as delicious as it is 
simple, and is always a favorite with Hygienists. 



ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

Prepare asparagus as for boiling in the ordinary man- 
ner ; cut the tender part of the stalks into small pieces ; 
add half the quantity of potatoes, and cook till a thick 
soup is formed. This is a favorite and delicious dish. 



VEGETABLE BROTH. 

This may be made of various combinations and pro- 
portions of the vegetables used in making soups, to suit 
different tastes or fancies. The following recipe will 
serve as a basis. Take four turnips, two carrots, one 
onion, and a spoonful of lentil flour. Cut the vegetables 
in pieces, and boil all the ingredients together until well 
cooked, in water sufficient to make a thin soup. 



BARLEY BROTH. 

Take four ounces of pearl barley ; two turnips, and 
three ounces of corn-meal ; steep the barley (after being 
washed) twelve hours ; put it on the fire in five quarts 
of water ; add the turnips chopped fine ; boil one hour ; 
stir iri the meal ; thin if necessary with more water, and 
let it simmer gently twenty minutes. 



soups. 43 

PORRIDGES. 

These are thin mushes. Oat-meal is the favorite article 
for porridge ; but wheat-meal makes a good dish. The 
following recipe will serve for all dishes of this kind. 
Stir one-fourth of a pound of oat-meal into a little cold 
water until the mixture is smooth and uniform ; add 
one pint of boiling water, and boil twenty minutes. 



GRUELS. 



These are thin porridges. They may be made in the 
same manner, adding two or three times as much water. 
They are seldom used except for fever patients. Wheat- 
meal and corn-meal make the best dishes. 




VEGETABLES. 

GENERAL RULES. 

LL boiled vegetables should be cooked in as 
ltttle water as possible ; the secret of procur- 
ing the richest flavor and best quality of boiled 
vegetable food consists in using just water 
enough to have it nearly evaporated when the vegetables 
are done. The water should be boiling when the vege- 
tables are put in it and raised to the boiling point as soon 
as possible afterwards. With few exceptions all edible 
vegetables are more wholesome as well as nutritive when 
fully ripe. The principal exceptions are, peas, beans, 
corn, cucumbers and spinach, which may be eaten at 
any stage of growth. The fresher they are the better 
always. The cook who would economize fuel and labor 
should know that boiling is a process that cannot be 
hurried. If the water is kept at the boiling point nothing 
more can be done to hurry the cooking. Any additional 
heat is lost in steam. All vessels in which vegetables 
are boiled should be kept clean and bright. In baking 
potatoes it is important that those of nearly uniform size 
be selected, if all are to be placed on the table at the 



VEGETABLES. 45 

same time. Probably no common article of food is 
more abused by the agriculturist and maltreated by the 
cook, than the potato. And we commend to all who 
would understand the culture, preservation, and best 
method of using this important tuber, a little work by 
Dr. John McLaurin, entitled the "Model Potato."* 

MODEL COOKED POTATOES. 
Select potatoes of uniform size ; wash quickly in cold 
water, without cutting; put them in a kettle or tight- 
lidded saucepan, filling the vessel about two-thirds full ; 
cover tightly, and cook them in their own juices. They 
should be put in an oven or over a fire sufficiently hot 
to convert the water they contain into steam. As soon 
as softened they can be peeled and placed on the table, 
or served with their skins on. Cooked in this manner 
potatoes have a richness of flavor unknown to any other 
method. ^^^__ 

BOILED POTATOES. 
Wash in cold water without cutting ; cover them with 
water, and boil in a covered vessel until soft enough to 
be readily penetrated with a fork ; pour off the water ; 
shake them up loosely, and let them remain uncovered 
to dry. Some kinds of potatoes have a richer flavor 
when cooked with the skins on.

46 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

BOILED PEELED POTATOES. 
Wash, pare, and put them in cold water ; if old they 
are improved by soaking several hours ; then boil them 
in water just sufficient to cover them, the kettle being un- 
covered ; as soon as the fork will readily pass through 
them, pour off the water, shake them up loosely, and let 
them remain uncovered a few minutes. This method 
renders them dry and mealy. 



MASHED POTATOES. 
Wash, pare and boil the potatoes according to the 
preceding recipe ; when tender pour off the water and 
mash them until smooth and destitute of lumps ; then 
beat them with a fork until they are light and white, and 
send to the table, not pressed down, but laid in the dish 
lightly. 



BROWNED POTATOES. 
Take cold boiled potatoes, cut them in thin slices ; lay 
them on a gridiron ; place them over the fire, or on a 
tin in a hot oven ; if the latter, put them first on the 
bottom so that the under side will brown and the mois- 
ture escape ; then change them to the upper grate to 
brown the upper side. Send them immediately to the 
table. 



BROWNED MASHED POTATOES. 
Take cold mashed potatoes ; compress them into a 
dish, smoothing the top ; place them in a hot oven till 



YEGETABLES. 47 

warmed thoroughly through, and browned on the top. 
An elegant dish may be made by forming the mashed 
potatoes into small cones two and a half inches high, 
placing them on a pan, and browning quickly in a hot 
oven. 

BAKED POTATOES. 
If the potatoes to be baked are all to be served at the 
same time, it is very important that they are of nearly 
uniform size. They require a hot oven, and as soon as 
done, the skin of each should be broken to let out the 
vapor, then served immediately. 



ROASTED POTATOES. 
Wash them carefully ; cover with hot ashes, and when 
done they will be very rich and mealy. 



STEAMED POTATOES. 
In cooking potatoes by steam, the steam should be 
generated before putting the potatoes into the steaming 
vessel, and kept up briskly afterwards until they are 
done. It will render them more dry and mealy to take 
off the cover just before they are done, or put them in 
an oven to dry and finish. 

SWEET POTATOES. 
These may be baked or boiled with their skins on. 
When boiled they should be peeled before sending to 



48 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

the table. They may be par-boiled, then peeled and 
browned in the oven. They are excellent if sliced and 
browned the next day after being boiled. 



MASHED SWEET POTATOES. 

Sweet potatoes may be boiled and mashed, or mashed 
and browned in the manner mentioned for white potatoes. 



BOILED TURNIPS. 

Wash and peel the turnips ; put them in just boiling 
water enough to cook them and be evaporated by the 
time they are soft. They may be sent to the table whole, 
sliced or mashed. A little potato added and mashed 
with them makes a nice dish. 



BROWNED TURNIPS. 

These are very palatable when prepared of cold boiled 
turnips in the same manner as mashed or sliced potatoes. 
Early turnips are best, when cooked dry and mashed. 



BOILED BEETS. 

Wash the beets without cutting. The tops and fibrous 
roots should be twisted off instead of cut, so as not to 
waste the juice; they may be boiled like turnips, or 
steamed like potatoes ; a large kettle full requires boiling 
steadily four or five hours. When very tender place 
them in cold water and remove the skins ; then slice 



VEGETABLES. 49 

immediately and send to the table. Beets may also be 
baked like potatoes. 

CHOPPED BEETS AND TOMATOES. 

Chop very tenderly cooked beets very fine ; mix them 
with an equal quantity of canned or stewed tomatoes ; 
boil them together a few minutes, and send to the table. 



BOILED PARSNIPS. 

Wash the parsnips, scrape their skins off, and if large 
cut them in pieces ; put them into boiling water and 
cook till very tender. It is well to have all the water 
evaporate in the process of cooking, and if they are 
browned a little on the bottom of the kettle it will add to 
the richness of their flavor. When stewed until the 
liquor becomes rich and sweet, this should be served 
with the parsnips. 



BROWNED PARSNIPS. 

Cold boiled parsnips, sliced and browned in the same 
manner as potatoes, make an excellent relish with break- 
fast. 



CARROTS. 



These may be boiled and browned in the same man- 
ner as parsnips and potatoes. They require longer 
cooking than parsnips, and to most persons are much 
less palatable. 



50 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

Take off the outer leaves ; cut the head in quarters 01 
half-quarters ; cook in as small a quantity of water as pos- 
sible until thoroughly done. It should be cooked in a 
tightly-covered kettle. 



CABBAGE AND TOMATOES. 

Chop the cabbage fine ; place it in a kettle witn very 
little water, and cover tightly; let the moisture nearly 
evaporate, and when nearly done, add one half the 
quantity of canned or stewed tomatoes ; cook thoroughly, 
being careful not to burn the mixture. 



CAULIFLOWER. 
Cut off the green leaves ; cleanse the heads carefully 
from insects ; then boil in water just sufficient to be 
evaporated when the article is tender. 



ASPARAGUS. 
Put the stalks into cold water ; cut off all that is very 
tough ; then peel and tie the stalks in a bundle or 
bundles ; boil fifteen to twenty minutes, or until tender ; 
lift them on the dish, remove the string, and send to the 
table. 



GREENS. 



Under this head are comprised spinach, beet-tops, cab- 
bage-sprouts, turnip-leaves, mustard-leaves, all of which are 



VEGETABLES. 5 1 

excellent, and milk-weed leaves, cowslips, and dandelion 
leaves, which, though a trifle bitter, are not unwhole- 
some. All require to be carefully washed and cleaned, 
and boiled until very tender ; then drained in a colander 
and sent to the table. 



GREEN PEAS. 

These are much richer in flavor if gathered just before 
being cooked ; do not wash the pods unless necessary ; 
shell and cook immediately in just water enough to 
make a rich sweet gravy with them. 

When very young and tender it improves them to 
wash the pods and then scald them in the water in which 
the peas are to be cooked ; then remove the pods and 
add the peas ; when cooked they will have a sweeter 
flavor, derived from the juices of the pods. 



GREEN BEANS. 
When very young the pods need only to be clipped, 
cut finely, and boiled in as little water as possible until 
tender ; when older, break off the ends and strip off the 
strings that line their edges ; break them into small 
pieces, and boil until tender. They require boiling 
three or four hours. 



BOILED GREEN CORN. 
Trim off the husks and silk ; put the ears in hot 
water, and boil them twenty or thirty minutes ; or the 



52 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

ears may be steamed one-half to three-fourths of an hour. 
The kernels may be cut from the cob, scraping the cob 
after cutting, a little hot water added, and cooked by 
boiling ten or fifteen minutes. 



ROASTED GREEN CORN. 

Remove the husks and silk ; place the ears on a 
gridiron, and this over red hot coals or in a hot oven. 



SUCCOTASH. 
This is usually made of green corn and garden beans, 
though string beans are sometimes added. Cut the corn 
from the cobs, scraping them afterwards ; add the beans 
and a trifle of hot water ; cover closely and boil until 
the beans are soft. Lima beans and sugar corn make 
an excellent succotash. 



GARDEN BEANS. 

Shell the beans from the pod ; add a very little water, 
and cook until the beans are very tender and the juice 
thickened. 



LIMA BEANS. 
These should be cooked in the same manner as garden 



beans. 



BOILED DRIED BEANS. 
Wash the beans thoroughly, and put them in a kettle 



VEGETABLES. 53 

of colfi W ater; let them be heated slowly to the boiling 
point, and cooked until done— about three hours. Do 
not parboil them. It is a mistaken notion that the first 
water is injurious. It removes much of the richness of 
the bean to turn off the water. It is well to let them 
soak over night, first washing them, and then cooking 
them in the water in which they have been soaked. 

BAKED DRIED BEANS. 
Prepare them as for boiling ; boil them nearly soft, 
place them in the baking pan, with a part of the water, 
and let them bake in the oven until moderately browned. 

MASHED BAKED BEANS. 
Prepare them according to the preceding recipe, only 
a little drier ; then with a spoon or pestle mash them to 
a powder and bake. This is a delicious dish. 

BEANS AND CABBAGE. 
When the beans are half boiled, add a head of cabbage, 
cut into small pieces. Beans and potatoes may be mixed 
in the same manner. 

SPLIT PEAS. 

Pick them over carefully and wash thoroughly ; put 

them over the fire in cold water ; adding hot water as 

they become dry ; they may be cooked nearly dry, or 

more moist, as preferred. They require cooking about 



54 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

two hours. They may be baked in the same manner as 
beans. When cold they may be sliced and browned, 
making a nice breakfast dish. 



DRIED GREEN PEAS. 
Pick over and wash thoroughly ; soak them over night 
in soft water ; in the morning put them over the fire in 
the water in which they have been soaked ; boil three 
hours and a half, or until tender. These may be baked 
in the same manner as beans. 



CUCUMBERS. 
These require no cooking. They are not objection- 
able to healthy stomachs, nor to most invalids, if eaten 
fresh as a part of the meal. If kept any time they should 
be placed in the refrigerator, or in cold water 




OHAPTBn VIII. 
FRUITS. 

GENERAL RULES. 

HE majority of good ripe fruits cannot be im- 
proved by cooking, provided they are to con- 
stitute a principal or even large proportion of 
21 the meal ; nevertheless they can be cooked in 
many ways without impairing their wholesomeness, and 
rendering some of them more acceptable to invalid 
stomachs, as well as agreeable to tastes variously culti- 
vated, and more or less vitiated. Fruits may be baked, 
steamed, boiled, or stewed, the only rules to be observed 
being, to cook them uniformly until soft, and not scorch 
or burn them. We give a list of our favorite recipes. 
Fruits should be cooked in stone or porcelain vessels, 
not in tin, brass, or copper. 



BAKED APPLES. 

Select apples of nearly uniform size ; fill the baking 
plate with them, pour on a few spoonsful of water, and 
cook till softened all through. 



56 HVGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

BAKED APPLES WITH DATES. 

Take large tart apples ; pare and core them whole ; 
fill the place of the core with dates ; place them in the 
baking plate, pour over them a little water, and cook till 
softened thronorh. 



BAKED PARED APPLES. 



Pare, quarter, and core the apples ; fill the pudding 
dish with them ; if very tart distribute a few pieces of 
dates among them ; if very juicy add no water, if not add 
a little ; bake and place them in a cool place. 



STEAMED APPLES. 



For steaming apples should be prepared as for baking. 
About twice as much time is required as for baking. 



STEWED APPLES. 

Apples may be stewed whole, or with the skins or 
cores, or both removed. They certainly have a richer 
flavor when cooked with the skins on. When quite tart 
a few dates may be cooked with them. A very nice and 
delicious dish is made by passing s-tewed apples through 
a colander, beating them until light and spongy, and 
placing them in a pudding dish, to be moderately 
browned in the oven. 



FRUITS. 57 

STEWED DRIED APPLES. 
Pick over the fruit carefully, reject all imperfect or 
discolored pieces ; wash thoroughly ; then boil in just 
water enough to cover them. They may be flavored 
with proper proportions of dried peaches, raisins, figs, 
dates, or quinces. 



PEARS. 

Pears may be baked, boiled, or stewed, in the same 
manner as apples. Some varieties of small early pears 
are very delicious when boiled whole without paring, or 
stewed a long time with a few dates among them. 

As pears are among the most perishable of fruits, they 
may be picked before they are quite ripe, and* placed in 
a dry cool place to ripen. A favorite method with us of 
cooking such pears is, to pare, halve and core them, 
and stew in sufficient water to make a rich juice, adding 
a few figs to flavor. Send the dish cold to the table. 



PEACHES. 
The idea of cooking good ripe peaches is never to be 
entertained. But those of inferior quality, or those not 
fully ripe, may be improved by boiling them. They 
should be peeled, except when the skins are very smooth, 
clean and tender. They should not be stoned. Figs 
are the best seasonings, and should be cut in pieces and 
cooked with them. 



58 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

STEWED DRIED PEACHES. 

Dried peaches (or dried pears when obtainable) may 
be stewed in the same manner as dried apples. A nice 
dish may be prepared by cooking them rather dry, 
mashing them through a colander, placing the pulp on 
a pie plate, and baking moderately in the oven. 



APRICOTS. 
Apricots are to be prepared and used in the same 
manner as peaches. 



QUINCES. 
Quinces are of little value per se, but when dried or 
canned, are excellent to flavor other fruits with. 



PINEAPPLES. 
The remarks in relation to quinces are equally appli- 
cable to pineapples. 



CRANBERRIES. 

Pick and wash the berries; add dates enough to 
sweeten to suit the taste ; stew in as little water as pos- 
sible without burning them until they become soft ; then 
mash the whole through a colander and set away to cool. 



BLACKBERRIES. 
Ripe and rich-flavored blackberries neither admit of 



FRUITS. 59 

nor require cooking. But when the fruit is unripe or 
inferior, it should be cooked. Pick over the fruit, and 
wash if necessary ; put it into a stew kettle with a very 
little water ; if very sour add a few dates ; boil fifteen 
minutes ; serve cold. 



WHORTLEBERRIES. 

When not fully ripe these may be cooked in the same 
manner as blackberries. 



RASPBERRIES. 
The same remarks apply to these berries. 



STRAWBERRIES. 
When not fully ripe, strawberries, for invalids, should 
be stewed with a few dates, taking care not to have them 
very juicy. When ripe and clean, no cooking, prepara- 
tion, or seasoning can improve them. If sandy or dirty 
they should be quickly rinsed in cold water before serv- 
ing. An ornamental dish may be prepared by putting a 
layer of green leaves around the edge of the dish, and 
filling it with the hulled berries. 



CHERRIES. 
When too sour or not sufficiently ripe to eat without 
cooking or seasoning, cherries may be stewed and 
sweetened with dates. 



60 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

PLUMS. 

There are many varieties of plums, some of which are 
sweet and luscious, while others are sour and unpalatable. 
They are to be managed in the same manner as cherries. 

CURRANTS. 

Green currants are not unwholesome when stewed 
and sweetened with dates. When fully ripe they are 
good without cooking. 



GOOSEBERRIES. 

These may be managed in the same manner as cur- 
rants. 



BANANAS. 

These are not cookable. They should be peeled, sliced, 
an d eaten with bread, rice, or mushes. 



ORANGES. 

These may be put on the table whole, or peeled and 
the sections separated. 



LEMONS. 

We only use lemons to flavor sauces, pies, puddings, 
greens, etc. 



FRUITS. 6 1 

TOMATOES. 
Very ripe tomatoes are better uncooked. But if im- 
perfectly ripened they should be stewed in as little water 
as possible and for a long time. They may be cooked 
in half an hour, but will improve if stewed one or even 
two hours longer. Crumbs or pieces of toasted bread 
are an excellent addition ; or the juice maybe thickened 
with a little Graham flour. 



MELONS. 

None of the numerous varieties of watermelons and 
muskmelons can be improved by cooking. They should 
not be taken from the vines till fully ripe, and the 
sooner after being gathered they are eaten, the more 
wholesome and delicious. 



RHUBARB. 
This is prepared as for making pie, and stewed with 
dates to sweeten. 



PUMPKINS. 
Some of the richer kinds of pumpkins are good if 
baked ; but all are excellent when properly stewed or 
steamed. As little water as possible without allowing 
the pumpkin to burn should be used. Like tomatoes, 
pumpkin is rendered richer and sweeter by prolonged 
cooking. When nearly done it should be left uncovered, 
to evaporate some of the water. 



62 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

SQUASH. 

Stewing is the usual method of cooking all kinds of 
squashes; but some of the more solid and richer kinds 
are excellent and sometimes preferable when baked. 
Wash, wipe, cut in four or more pieces, remove the 
seeds, and bake in a pan. Steaming squash, however, 
is better than boiling it. 



GRAPES. 



The idea of cooking rich ripe grapes is inadmissible ; 
if sour or not fully ripe, they may be stewed in as little 
water as possible, and pressed through a colander to re- 
move the skin and seeds. 

PRUNES. 

Stew them until soft in just water enough to cover 
them ; do not stir them so as to mangle the skins ; they 
should appear on the table plump and unbroken. 

ENGLISH DRIED CURRANTS. 
These are generally used to flavor ether dishes, but 
are excellent of themselves; they maybe stewed in the 
same manner as most other dried fruits. 



FIGS. 
When quite fresh, figs are better uncooked ; when old 



FRUITS. 63 

they should be quickly washed in boiling water, and 
then stewed until soft. 



DATES. 

These may be eaten uncooked with other foods ; but 
we seldom use them except to sweeten and flavor other 
fruits and foods. 




OIHI^IF^TIECFt 131. 



PRESERVING FOODS. 



GENERAL RULES. 




ANNING, drying, and refrigeration are the 
only hygienic processes for preserving fruits, 
vegetables, or foods of any kind. Antiseptics 
of every sort — salt, sugar, vinegar, alcohol, etc., 
not only add injurious ingredients, but change the 
organic arrangement of the constituent molecules, dete- 
riorate the quality of the food, and lessen its nutritive 
value. 

The process of canning has reached great perfection 
within a few years, so that almost all kinds of fruits and 
vegetables can be preserved in their natural flavors for an 
indefinite time, without a particle of sugar or salt. All 
that is required is a perfect expulsion of atmospheric air, 
and its complete exclusion afterwards. Some articles 
require heating to the boiling point, and others con- 
siderable cooking in order to expel all the air. 

Of the various jars for canning, the best are ' ' Masons, " 



PRESERVING FOODS. 6$ 

the "Gem," and the "Hero." These are all of glass, 
and for fruits no other material should be employed. 

Within a few years great improvements have been 
made in drying fruits and vegetables. And the recent 
introduction of "Boswell's Heater and Dryer" seems to 
be all that can be desired for families to dry any food 
they wish to preserve in that manner, economically and 
in perfection. 

The objections to drying in the sun is the exposure of 
the articles to dust and insects, while drying over a range 
or in an oven is troublesome and expensive. Some of 
the methods for. drying which have been introduced and 
patented, although rapid and economical, do not well 
preserve the nutritive value and natural flavor of the 
articles. Some of them are so arranged that the steam 
or vapor which is evaporated from the lower tiers or 
layers passes through those above, thus cooking <w/and 
dissipating their juices and flavor. This is obviated in 
"Boswell's Heater and Dryer." This is so arranged 
that a current of fresh air carries the moisture of each 
layer into the flue, producing an article which for flavor, 
richness, color, and nutritive value, cannot probably be 
excelled. As the Heater is useful also in drying clothes, 
heating rooms, and in cooking victuals, every family which 
has fruit to dry will find it doubly economical ; and it 
would pay many who do not raise fruit, to purchase in 
season and dry for themselves in Boswell's Heater. 

Fruits for canning should he carefully selected, and all 



66 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

imperfect, decayed, or unripe ones rejected. When 
sandy or unclean they should be quickly and carefully 
washed. Blackberries, raspberries, and whortleberries, 
are canned without difficulty so as to keep well. Straw- 
berries require longer cooking and more careful manage- 
ment. Grapes, cherries, currants, and all of the staple 
fruits are successfully canned with little trouble. 



BERRIES. 
Cover them with a little water in a stewing kettle ; boil 
for a few minutes, being careful not to have them burned ; 
fill the jar with them while boiling hot ; wipe the edges 
of the jars clean ; screw down the top tight, and put 
them in a cool place. Do not let a draught of cold air 
strike them, or they may break. The jar for receiving 
the fruit should be clean and hot. A convenient me- 
thod of heating it is to place it sidewise into hot water, 
(being careful that the water enters the inside the mo- 
ment it touches the outside, or the vessel may crack), 
give it a whirl, lift it out and let the water run out, set it 
in a pan over the stove or in a warm place, and fill 
immediately. When stone jars are employed for can- 
ning, place them on the stove, with a little cold water 
in them, some time before commencing to cook the 
fruit. When the water in them is heated nearly to the 
boiling point, they may be emptied and filled with the 
hot fruit. The cork should fit closely, and be covered 
with cement. This may be made of sealing-wax and 



PRESERVING FOODS. 67 

bees-wax, or of resin and bees-wax ; the proportions of 
sealing-wax and bees-wax should be such that the 
cement when cold will be neither sticky nor brittle. 
The cement should be melted and poured over the corks 
instantly after they are applied to the jars. The jars 
should be watched until cold, and if any air-bubbles 
appear in the cement, prick them and add more cement. 



STRAWBERRIES. 

As these berries are exceptional, we give a special 
recipe. Boil the fruit thirty minutes after filling the jars 
in the manner above mentioned, let them stand five 
minutes to settle ; fill the shrinkage, seal tight, and turn 
the jars on their top ; let them remain in this position 
over night ; the next morning the imperfect ones can 
be detected and corrected. 



GRAPES. 

Canned grapes are admissable with mushes and pud 
dings in the winter season, or as a relish with any kind 
of farinaceous food at all seasons. Select the freshest, 
nicest bunches, and can in the usual manner. An ex- 
cellent jelly for farinaceous dishes may be prepared by 
stewing the grapes, mashing them through a colander to 
remove the skins and seeds/ and then canning in the 
usual manner. 



68 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

PACKING GRAPES. 

Grapes may be easily preserved in the following man- 
ner : Take the late grapes ; pick them carefully ; spread 
them out in a cool place in layers on shelves ; let them 
remain two weeks ; then pack them in barrels with dry 
hard-wood sawdust. Bran will answer very well. Packed 
in this manner the fruit will keep good through the 
winter. After packing they.should be kept in a cool 
and dry place. 

Grapes may be kept in good condition for several 
weeks, by dipping the end of the stem of perfect bunches 
in melted sealing-wax, then wrapping the bunches in 
tissue paper, and laying or suspending them in a dry 
cool place. The more paper that is placed between them 
the longer they will keep. 



APPLES. 
Peel, quarter, core, and stew until soft; then can 
them in the same manner as berries. 



PEACHES. 
In order to preserve their color, peaches after being 
peeled should be kept in cold water, until you are 
ready to can them. They are canned in the same man- 
ner as berries. They may be canned with or without 
peeling and stoning. It is important that they are boil- 
ing hot when sealed, and that all of the fruit is covered 
by its juices. 



PRESERVING FRUITS. 69 

PEARS. 
These may be treated in the same manner as peaches. 
If gathered before they are quite ripe, they may be laid 
away in a dry, cool place to ripen, and then canned. 



TOMATOES. 
Those of the firmest flesh, or least juicy, are the best 
for canning ; cover them with hot water ; remove the 
skins and cut away all the green part ; then stew and can 
in the usual manner. This fruit may be improved by 
much cooking before canning. There is no objection to 
tin cans for preserving tomatoes, if they are new ; and 
the fruit is more easily kept in them, as they can be 
hermetically sealed without difficulty. 



RHUBARB. 
Peel the rhubarb ; stew with dates enough to sweeten 
as desired, and can in the usual manner. 



BANANAS. 
This fruit may be canned in the usual manner. It 
makes an admirable sweetening and flavoring ingredient 
for pies. 



VEGETABLES. 
Green corn, peas, beans, and asparagus, are preserved 
by canning with more difficulty than are most kinds of 



70 HYGEIAN HOME COOK-BOOK. 

fruits ; hence nearly all the canning establishments add 
more or less sugar, salt, or some other antiseptic. But 
this is entirely unnecessary. Ifwell cooked and managed 
in all respects in the manner recommended for straw- 
berries, there need be no difficulty in keeping them fresh 
and sweet the year round. 



Note. — A Miss Jones, of New York, has invented a method of 
canning fruit in their own juices without cooking them, which is 
said to be a labor-saving and economical improvement on all exist- 
ing methods of canning. It consists in removing the air from the 
fruit and vessel holding it, filling the vacuum by infiltrating the 
juices of other fruit, previously prepared, and then sealing. Con- 
siderable machinery is required for this process, and we hope she 
will soon have it so perfected and cheapened that it may come 
into general use.

through anxious periods — to his household. Will he not 
grant her this trifling boon ? 

The above gives a fair idea of the nature and scope of this work. It will be seen 
that it covers the whole ground, and, if it is carefully read, will go far towards giv-
