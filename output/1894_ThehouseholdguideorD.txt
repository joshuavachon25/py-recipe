PUBLISHER'S PREFACE. 



. The object.of this volume is, to instruct every housekeeper 
in economjr m household affairs and in the use and appli- 
cation of simple domestic remedies. Jt may be properlv 
called a book of Self Instruction in the art of home doctorine 
1 his work has been especially written to benefit and bless' 
suffering humanity everywhere. The language is simple 
and technical terms ha,ve been carefully omitted, and the 
book Itself makes up a 63mplete scries of Home Lessons in 
Medicine, which can be read and understood by all classes 
There has been rapid progress in the sc.cnce ot medicine iii 
the past few years. Old methods and old receipts have been 
replaced by new remedies and new methods of application 
bo It IS especially necessary in these times of proo-ress to 
have a book which is up to date and abreast of the times. 

There are many plants on every farm, in every garden 
and there are many simple remedies in every home, and 
other harmless remedies, which can be easily secured, which 
will relieve pain and cure disease. Simple home remedies 
and good nursing in ordinary cases, will do more good and 
give quicker relief than the best practicing physician can 
with his strong drugs and periodical visits. The most skill- 
tul physician can benefit the patient but little without good 
care and careful nursing in the home. Consequently nursing 
and caring for the sick is a prominent feature in this worfc 

This book seems to fill a long-felt want. There have been 
many books published on medicine, and placed in the hands 
ot the inexperienced homekeepers, but they are not safe 
guides for anyone to follow, who is unskilled in the art of 
compounding medicine. Strong drugs are dangerous and 
their use in the Household Guide is largely discouraged, for 
they are not safe in the hands of the common people with- 
out the direction of a physician. In serious cases of sickness 
the family physician should always be summoned, but 
remember that mne-tenths of the ills that afflict mankind 
can be cured by careful nursing and the application of simple 
andsafe home remedies, and those who secure the House- 
hold Guide, will find it ever helpful in giving good counsel 
in sickness and a safe guide in health.

1. The Snblimest Moment in a Younj? Man's Life.— The 

subiimest moment in a young man's life is when he can take 
his newly-wed wife by the hand and lead her under his own 
roof and say to her, " This is our home." Married life, 
with the comfort of children, weaves threads of golden joy 
into the .ares and toil? of life. No pleasures, no enjoyment 
can excel the comforts and contentment of a happy home. 

2. Home! What a HaUowftd Name. — How full of en- 
chantment and how dear to the heart ! Home is the magic 



Home.

circle within which the weary spirit finds refuge ; it is the 
sacred asylum to which ^he care-worn heart retreats to find 
rest from the toils and inquietudes of life. 

3. What is Home?— Ask the lone wanderer as he plods 
his tedious way, bent with the weight of age, and white with 
the frost of years, ask him, what is home ? He will tell you, 
"it IS a green spot in memory ; an oasis in the desert ; a cen- 
ter about which the fondest recollections of his grief-op- 
pressed heart cling with all the tenacity of youth's first 
love. It was once a glorious, a happy reality, but now it 
rests only as an image of the mind." 

4. Tender Associations.— Home ! that name touches ev- 
ery fiber of the soul, and strikes every chord of the human 
heart with its angelic fingers. Nothing but death can break 
the spell. What tender associations are linked with home ! 
What pleasing images and deep emotions it awakens ! It 
calls up the fondest memories of life and opens in our 
nature the purest, deepest, richest gush of consecrated 
thought and feeling. Next to religion, the deepest and 
most ineradicable sentiment in the human soul is that of 
home affections. Every heart vibrates to this theme. 

^ 5. Stronger than Death.— Home has an influence which 
is stronger than death. It is a law to our hearts, and binds 
Hf ^* 1^ ^P^^^ which neither time nor change can break ; 
the darkest villainies which have disgraced humanity can- 
not neutralize it. Gray-haired and demon guilt will make 
his dismal cell the sacred urn of tears wept over the mem- 
ories of home, and these will soften and melt into tears of 
penitence even the heart of adamant. 

6. Home of Mj Childhood I— What words fall upon th« 
ear with so much music in their cadence as those which re- 
call the scenes of innocent and happy childhood, now num- 
bered with the memories of the past f How fond recollec- 
tion aelights to dwell upon the events which marked our 
early pathway, when the unbroken home circle presented a 
scene of loveliness vainly sought but in the bosom of a 
happy family ! Intervening years have not dimmed tht 
vivid coloring with which memory has adorned those joy- 
ous hours of youthful innocence. 

^^ 7. Peace at Home.— Peace at home, that is the boon. 
He is happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in 
his home. Home shouM be made so truly home that 
the weary tempted heart could turn toward it anywhere on 
5^ Tj u^ highway of life and receive light and strength; 
should be the sacred refuge of our lives, whether rich or poor. 
The ties that bind the wealthy and the proud to home may

be forged on earth, but those which link the poor man to 
his humble hearth are of true metal and bear the stamp 
of heaven. 

8. Husband and Wife.— There is nothing in the 
world which is so venerable as the character of parents; 
nothing so intimate and endearing as the relation of hus- 
band and wife; nothing so tender as that of children; 
nothing so lovely as those brothers and sisters. The little 
circle is made one by a singular union of the aflfections. 
The only fountain in the wilderness of life, where man 
drinks of water totally unmixed with bitter ingredients, 'is 
that which gushes for him in the calm and shady recess 
of domestic life. 




CLIFF DWELLERS— THE FIRST INHABITANTS OF EARTH. 

9. Pleasure. — Pleasure may heat the heart with arti- 
ficial excitement, ambition may delude it with golden 
dreams, war may eradicate its fine fibers and diminish 
its sensitiveness, but it is only domestic love that can 
render it truly happy! 

10. Home. — Let thrones rot and empires wither. 
Home! Let the world die in earthquake struggles, and be 
buried amid procession of planets and dirge of spheres. 
Home! Let everlasting ages roll in irresistible sweep. 
Home! No sorrow, no crying, no tears, no death; but 
home! Sweet home! Beautiful home! Glorious home! 
Everlasting home! Home with each Dther! Home with 
angels! Home with God! Home, home! Through the 
rich grace of our Redeemer, may we all reach it,

and encourage the work of the faithful housewife. Men 
are only apparently leaders. Close scrutiny will generally

managing woman, at whose fingers' ends are wisdom and 
virtue, IS indispensable to the comfort of a household,

to rnake the home unhappy. Punctuality in preparing 
breakfast and dinner and in everything that tends to add 
*° the comfort of the home is essential to the' happiness 
of the home. To these qualities add a becoming taste in 
little things that gives to the humblest home beauty and 
elegance, and a model home can be found even where 
poverty exists.

hands be at rest while there is any bit of helpful service 
she can render. If she can, without observation, slip 
(he burnt roll or undercrust on her plate, it is done. If 
some one must stay at home when there is a day's outmg, 
she tells, with music in every tone, how glad she will be 
to be left quietly behind and have time all to herself 
to do ever so many things she has in mind. And none 
suspect from word or tone how great the sacrifice to give 
up the pleasure. 

Her quick eye detects the oversight or neglect on the 
part of another, and she quickly hastens to remedy the 
matter, careful that none shall know her hand has made 
up another's ilure. Is a harsh round of judgment started 
by some ill-advised criticism, she deftly and tenderly drops 
the gentlest, the sweetest possible word for the criticised 
one, and switches the conversation to other topics. 

Do we not all recognize this "angel"? We call her 
mother, wife, sister. In the glory-land they will call 

her saint. , , 

A Successful Life is nothing more nor less for man 
or for woman than living as well as we know how and 
doing the very best that we can. Success cannot be 
measured by fame, wealth or station. The life of the 
humblest woman in the land, if well lived, is as successful 
as is that of the woman, who, with greater oppo tunities, 
is enabled to make the results of her works reacn farther. 
Some of us must live for the few, as others again must 
live for the many. But both lives are successful. Each 
of us in this world influences some other being, and it 
is the quality of our influence, and not the number we 
influence, which makes our lives successful in the eyes 
of God. We may believe that we go to our graves un- 
known and unsung, but not one of us goes out from this 
world without leaving an impression, either for the good 
or the bad. And the kind of impression we make while 
we live, and leave when we die, is the difference between 
successful and unsuccessful living.

THE ART OP HAPPY LIVING. 

Yes, and an art it is that deserves the attention and 
study of all. It includes the art of making the best of 
everything and should be cultivated and developed by 
parents and teachers, and perfected by intelligent self- 
culture. Happiness is not an indescribable something 
always beyond one's grasp, but is in the reach of all, if 
we but look for it in the common path of life, in the or- 
dinary routine of every day duty. 

Not in Wealth. — It is a serioiiS; but verv common error 
to assume that wealth brings happiness. While abundant

means may be i ^ n»nieiit, these do not usuuiiy or neces- 
sarily add to the h jppiness of the possessor, but on the 
oilier hand, sometimes brinj^ care ami anxiety, which drive 
out the last rays of happy living. The humblest lot, 
althoiiph associated vvith toil, may become a little paradise 
on earth, when affiliated with it are a seeing eye, a feeling 
heart, a helping hand, an elevating purpose, and an intelli- 
gent effort at self-improvement. Without these essentials 
even wealth becomes a burden. 

Home AtmoHphcrc— Of all the minor arts and sciences 
none is more delightful in itself or richer in its 
compensations than the creation of the home atmosphere; 
and although the ability to make a home is a natural 
endowment of some fortunate beings, it is not the less 
a talent which may be cultivated, and which will continu- 
ally repay the time and care devoted to its acquirement, 

Houses and Homes.— There arc houses and there are 
f imes, and it must be a very indifferent or a very selfish 
woman who cannot evolve a home from the least promis- 
ing elements, and take pride in improving it to the ut- 
most. 

Gift of Arranarement.— The majority of women possess 
what Hawthorne calls "the gift of practical arrangement," 
which is, he continues, "a kind of natural magic that 
enables these favored ones to bring out the hidden ca- 
pabilities of things around them, and particularly to give 
a look of habitableness to any place which, for however 
brief a period, may happen to be their home." Under 
the skillful touch of these persons, unpromising or incon- 
gruous materials are brought into subjection, harmonious 
arrangement- replace stiff outlines, defects are concealed 
and good points emphasized, so that rooms which have 
been hard and forbidding assunic a genial and inviting 
aspect. These clever folks not only work their spells 
upon unlovely surroundings; they accompli h what is 
even more difificult by giving an air of domesticity and 
use to the most splendid apartments, effectually dispelling 
that soulless magnificence which is so depressing to warm- 
hearted every-day people. 

Order. — Order, indeed, must reign in every true home 
and there mns be some regulations for the general 
good which aie ^ • ly 'mt firmly enforced. Sometimes 
mists of discomPfiV -" .-;ha' ;. gusts of rebellion darken 
and disturb the .i;. ' t. :'.:se become fewer as the dear 
mother way is lecoj/. !z;;d to be a v.ays the best way.

Sunlight and Healik. 



2. Seclusion from Sunshine.— Seclusion from sunshine is 
one of the great misfortunes of our civihzed hfe. The same 
cause which malces the potato vines white and sickly when 
grown in dark cellars, operates to produce the pale, sickly 
girls that are reared in our parlors. Expose either to the 
rays of the sun, and they begin to show color, health and 
strength. 

3. Philosophy of the Influence of Sunlight.— Recent 

discoveries seem to prove that there is conveyed to animals, 
by the direct action of the sun's rays, a subtle current of iron. 
It does not exist in light, or but very slightly, if at all, but 
it is a part of the sun's rays. Therefore, we must enjt.y 
these rays if we would feel their full effect. This iron it is 
which is supposed to give color to plants and animals, and 
to impart strength and beauty. With strength and beauty 
come health and good spirits, and despondency and fear are 
banished. 

4. Sunlight and Plants.— It is well known that no valua- 
ble plant can grow well without being visited by the direct 
rays of the sun; no plant can bear seed, no fruit can ripen 
without it. Any vine grown in the dark is white and 
strengthless. Grass, grain and flowers do not thrive under 
the shadow of a tree. 

5. Sunlight and Domestic Animals.- It is well known 
that no valuable domestic animals can thrive without being 
visited often by the sunshine. The fish of the Mammoth 
Cave are white; their eyes are not opened, because they 
have never felt the glorious light; they are weak and im- 
perfect, a kind of idiots, if fish are liable to that wretched- 
ness. Swine which are shut under the farmer's barns, and 
where everything is favorable except the lack of sunshine, 
do not thrive as well as those which have the ordinary run 
in the open air. Cows and horses stalled continuously in 
dark stables become feeble and unhealthy, and become use- 
less in less than half the time of those which run in the open 
air, or whose stalls permit them to enjoy the influence of the 
sunlight. The same is true of all other domestic animals. 

6. Sunlight and Human Life.— Sir James Wylie says 
that "the cases of disease on the dark side of an extensive 
barrack at St. Petersburgh, have been uniformly, for many 
years, in the proportion of three to one to those on the side 
exposed to strong light." 

7. Sunlight and Miners.— The lack of pure light and 
pure air in mines tells seriously upon the health of miners. 
"Fourcault affirms that where Hfe is prolonged to the aver- 
age term, the evil effects of the want of light are seen in the

HEALTHY HOMES. 



"Cleanliness is the elegance of the poor."— Enelish 
Proverb. * 

"Virtue never dwelt long with filth and nastiness."— 
Count Rumford. 

Health is wealth. Almost all the fevers, cholera, and 
other plagues result from poisoned air, coming from bad 
drams, uncleaned streets, and badly kept back yards 
House slops and remnants of the table, or decaying vege- 
tables should never be allowed to be thrown in the back 
yard Good drains, clean cellars, and general cleanliness 
about the house, arc the only safeguards of health 

Flire air and good ventilation are just as necessary in 
the house as about the house. Whenever a number of 
persons live together the atmosphere becomes poisoned 
unless means are provided for its constant change and 
renovation. The death rate is much greater in crowded 
tenement houses than in the well ventilated and regulated 
homes of the wealthier classes. Diphtheria, scarlet fever, 
and other dreaded contagious diseases are more prevalent 
and tatal in our large cities than in the country or smaller 
towns.

impure Air.— Those who spend much of the time in the 
open air are not subjected to the evil effects of im- 
pure air as are those who are required to spend most 
ot their time indoors. And yet, all may suffer from the 
evil effects of a poorly ventilated bedroom, or a cellar 
where decaying vegetables are sending forth through 
crevices and cracks into ever apartment of the house 
poisonous and disease-producing air. The sources of im- 
pure air aie diverse and manifold.

Our Dnty.-Our duty ]ics in removing everything from 
dwelling and yard that may give rise to or produce foul 
air, and on the other hand in providing for ventilation 
of every rocm, especially the bedroom. 
Jeglectiiigr Ventilation.-That dull feeling in the morn- 
ng, that headache, that restlessness at night is verv 
frequently the result of had ventilation or no ventilation 
at all No one should occupy a bedroom that does not 
permit the foul air to escape, and pure air to enter. Many 
of the diseases to which men are subject are contracted 
by breathing impure air. 

How to Ventilate. — Fresh air can be obtained onlv 
from without. Cold air will injure no one, but drafti 
of cold upon only a part of the body may occasion severe 
cold. In all attempts to ventilate, drafts should be avoided 
A room can frequently be ventilated without causing drafts 
by lowering a window at the top on one side of a room 
and raising another a littl° at the bottom on the opposite 
side. Ihere should be two openings, one for the pure air 
to come in at and another for the bad air to go out at 

Another Method.— A very simple method to ventilate 
and still avoid drafts is to take a board the length of the 
window casing and about three or four inches wide. Place 
this board under the lower sash, thus making an opening 
between the two sashes where they overlap. In this way 
the air will enter and be thrown toward the ceiling, and a 
draft will be avoided. Whatever the method adopted be 
sure that ventilation is not neglected. Ventilate your 
rooms well if you would prolong life. 

Night Air.— Some persons have great prejudice against 
night air. Although night air may be damp and at times 
not so healthful, yet if we wish to br-athe at all at night 
we must breathe night air, the only kind there is at night 
The dangers of night air are largely imaginative, and at 
the most are nothing to be compared to the dangers and 
evils of badly ventilated and over-heated ' rooms 

u J** *" * Bed-room. -The theory that plants kept 
in bedrooms are injurious is contradicted by t'le best 
authorities. It is found that taking the whole twenty-four 
hours through, they do not surcharge the air with car- 
bonic acid gas. Plants purify the air during the night 
as well as during the day. ~ Strongly scented plants may 
by the odors which they emit, be unpleasant to the senses 
of a nervous person, but aside from this, plants with the 
cheerful aspect which they give to a room, with the pleas- 
ant recreation which their care affords, and with their

tendency to remove inipurilies from the air, are a blessing 
rather than an injury. 

(juiiiitiiy of Air.— Every person above fourteen years 
of age requires about six hunurcd cubic feet of shut-up 
space to breathe in during tiic twenty-four hours. If he 
sleeps in a room of smaller dimensions, he will suffer 
more or less the serious results of poisoned air. Shut up 
a niuuse in a glasr bottle and it will gradually die, by 
re-breathing its own breath. About half the children born 
in some manufacturnig towns die before they are five years 
old, principally because they want pure air. Every sleep- 
ing room, winter and summer, should have an open win- 
dow during the night, and the room and the beddmg 
should be thoroughly aired every morning. Remember 
that pure air in and about the home will do more to pre- 
serve health than all medicines. 

Cold Air. — Don t be afraid to go out of doors because 
it is a little colder than usual. The cold air will not hurt 
you if you are properly protected, and take exercise 
enough to keep the circulation active. On the contrary, 
it will do you good. It will purify your blood, it will 
strengthen your lungs, it will improve your digestion, it 
will afford a healthy, natural stimulus to your torpid cir- 
culation, and strengtnen and energize your whole system. 
The injury which often results from going into a cold 
atmosphere is occasioned by a lack of protection to some 
part of the body, exposure to strong drafts, or from 
breathing through the mouth. Avoid these, and you are 
safe. Don't be afraid to sleep in a cold room at night with 
the window a little open. Cold air, if pure, will not hurt 
you at night any more than in the day, if you are pro- 
tected by sufficient clothing, and by breathing through the 
nostrils. If you do not breathe thus, acquire the habit as 
soon as possible. 

Colds and Fevers. — If you wish to be subject to 
colds, coughs, and fevers, shut yourself in close, hot 
rooms day and night. If you wish to be free from their 
companionship, always hav? plenty of pure air to breathe 
night and day, take daily outdoor exercise, regardless of 
the weather, except as to clothing protection. 

Providence Blamed.— It is frequently the case that chil- 
dren and infants suflfer from bad air and bad air often does 
its part toward diseasing an infant. The loss of children 
in this way is generally attributed to "a special dispensa- 
tion of Providence," and the mother does not stop to 
think that bad air, improper fond and management all had 
their part in bringing on the aisease and making it fatal.

Deep Breathing. 



more and more a victim of exhaustion and irritability. 
Reduce life to the simplest terms. Eat and drink simply, 
live out of doors as much as you can, and when you are 
inclined to worry and to give your mind up to desponden- 
cy and despair, then summon philosopny to your aid. In 
that direction health lies. 

DEEP BREATHING. 

Cultivate the habit of breathing through the nose and 
taking deep breaths. If this habit was universal, there 
is little doubt that pulmonary affections would be de- 
creased one-half. An English physician calls attention 
to this fact, that deep and forced respiration will keep the 
entire body in a glow in the coldest weather, no matter 
how thinly o. may be clad. He was himself half frozen 
to death one night, and began taking deep breaths and 
keeping the air in his lungs as long as possible. The 
result was that he was thoroughly comfortable in a few 
minutes. The deep respirations, he says, stimulate the 
blood currents by direct muscular action, and cause the 
entire system to become pervaded with the rapidly-gen- 
erated heat. 

When to Begin. — Mothers should see that their little 
ones learn to breathe correctly — that is, through the nose, 
and to take long breaths. A long breath w.il expand 
and exercise the lungs to their fullest capacity, while a 
short breath only aflfects the upper part. For people with 
catarrhal tendencies or weak lungs there is nothing better 
than deep breathing. It puts the blood in circulation, 
thus benefiting the entire body. In cold weather deep 
breathing generates considerable heat and the one who 
can breathe well never feels the cold as does one who 
takes short breaths. 

Lung Streugthener.— Long breaths are lung strength- 
eners, and such exercise has cured severe colds in the 
lungs, and has been known to do more good than medi- 
cine in the early stages, or rather, at the appearance, of 
consumption. Such precaution and prevention cost nothing 
and it would be well to adopt the method. 

Art of Breathing —It is perhaps one of the signs of 
the times, to those alert for indications, that the art 
of breathing has become more and more a subject of 
atttention. Oculists, as well as physiologists, go deeply 
into its study in a way hardly to be touched upon here. 
Physicians have cured aggravated cases of insomnia by 
long-drawn regular breaths, fever-stricken patients have 



Deep Breathing, 



39 



been quieted, stubborn forms of indigestion made to dis- 
appear. A tendency to consumption may be entirely 
overcome, as some authority has within the last few years 
clearly demonstrated, by exercises in bicalhing. Sea- 
sickness, too, may be surmounted, and the victim of hyp- 
notic influence taught to withstand the force of any encrRv 
directed against him. 

Systematic Wreathing. _ Dr. Oertel. of Munich, has 
written an extensive work on breathing. We cannot en- 
ter into the philosophy of his system, but the simple rules 
laid down, without entering into an understanding of the 
principles underlying them, have been so helpful to many 
asthmatic patients and of inestimable value to all who 
practice them that we cannot pass this subject before call- 
ing attention to them. No one need ever "get out of 
breath" who follows the system, no matter how long the 
walk or how steep the climb. 

Rule for Ascent. — In making any ascent, either by 
stairway or path, the rule is to use one breath for every 
step. One should breathe through the nostrils, not talk, 
and go systematically to work. The fuller the breath 
the better. 

On the Level.— In walking along a level stretch take 
two steps to every breath. Always begin to exhale or 
inhale as the same foot touches the ground. 

Bidding the Lungs.— The third exercise is for ridding 
the lungs of the air accumulated there. It is practiced 
with the mouth open. Inhale as you put the right foot to 
the ground. Then, as the left touches the ground, exhale 
naturally, and as the right touches the ground exhale again 
with an effort, so expelling all the air from the lungs. 
Then inhale again, now on the left foot, exhale naturally 
on the right, and with an effort expel the air as the left 
foot falls. This exercise is kept up for some time, always 
in this way: Left foot, inhale; right foot, exhale; left 
foot, expel with efTort. Again, right foot, inhale; left 
,foot, exhale; right foot, expel with effort. The process 
of inhaling, therefore, begins with alternate footsteps. 

It must not be supposed that the gait of the individual 
IS badly afifected, made unduly awkward by the effort to 
breathe in this way. On the contrary, when once the 
idea is grasped, the whole movement of the individual 
becomes rhythmic and graceful. 

These rules, although simple, have been very beneficial 
to many.

Evils of Over-eating. 



THE EVIL OF OVER-EATINO. 

Exoeasps. — The excesses in the use of food and drink 
of some men are ahuost beyond bt'licf, and yet, in a few 
instances, the farts arc well aulhoiUicated. Brillat-Savarin, 
himself a famous epicure, relates the following anecdote: A 
friend expressed the despair of his life that he could never 
get nis "fill of oysters. ' "Come, dine with me and you 
shall have enough," said the epicure. The friend did, and 
ate thirty-one dozen oysters as a prelude to the ex- 
cellent dinner which was served. Downright gluttony 
IS not given frequent exhibition at the table of gentle 
people these days. It is considered rather nearer correct 
to affect a small appetite, such as requires the temptation 
of dainty dishes. This is. however, very frequently a small 
bit of deception, but it has merit, even though it leads 
those vvho resort to it to supplement meals taken in 
public, in the privacy of their own pantries. 

Duty of Houspwife.— In regard to this whole matter 
of gluttony it is the duty of the good housewife to keep 
down the appetite of her husband. Particularly is this 
necessary in tne cases of well-to-do professional and busi- 
ness men. In the families of mechanics earning low wages 
such a warning is almost wholly unnecessary, but it 
may be said of most men in good circumstances that they 
eat too freely of rich food. If men would begin careful 
and systematic physical culture in early youth and con- 
tinue the practice through life, good health would be the 
result. 

Exercise.— Beyond the age of forty— at a period when 
so many are physically lazy— 'the superior value of exer- 
cise is apparent; but ordinarily, this is just the time when 
the hygiene of athletics is neglected. There is no reason 
why a punching-bag, rowing-machine, pulley-weights and 
other apparatus should be relegated to college boys and 
clerks. But having done a good deal of work in his time 
it is almost impossible to persuade a business or pro- 
fessional man, turning forty, to give any sort of attention 
to physical culture if such training has been previously 
neglected. Hence, it is the duty of a woman to keep from 
her husband all rich compounds that will ultimately ruin 
his digestion. 

Hiprh Feeding. — High feeding is occasionally neutral- 
ized by hard exercise; but in the absence of the latter it is 
mischievous in the extreme. If your husband will stand 
the treatment, begin by switching off from the heavy 



Evils of Over-eating.

breakfast of steak, hot rolls, potatoes, etc., and set before 
him eggs-on-toast, oatincal, or any other of the manv 
excellent breakfast foods now. 

Effects.— The effects of over eating— or what is equally 
bad, injudicious eating— arc clearly perceived in the case 
of a man who trains for some athletic event. In really 
fine condition indigestion is great loss of power. A strong 
member of a college crew, "hard as nails," was utterly 
unfit to pull his oarblade through the water on the lour- 
mile journey down the Thames River, at New London, 
simply because of indiscretion in eating a few nights be- 
fore. This shows the importance oi diet. Napoleon is 
said to have lost the battle of Leipsic because of a fit of 
indigestion brought on by unusual indulgence. It is con- 
ceivable that a business man may lose a tempting contract, 
or a professional man an important cause for the same 
reason. Nor is this all. 

Financial Aspect — The financial aspect of the case is 
worthy of our consideration. By taking ofT a little here 
and a little there; by reducing condiments and sauces, 
expensive desserts and creamy compounds to a minimum, 
the grocer's account will be a complete surprise at the 
end of the month, while the husband's health as well as 
his pocketbook will show gratifying results. I know of a 
family whose members almost unconsciously fitted into 
this simpler way of living, until eventually the butcher and 
the baker received barely two-thirds of their former divi- 
dends. And each inmate of the household could almost 
have taken an oath that nothing had been subtracted from 
the menu, so gradual had been the shrinkage. 

Advice to Weary Women. — Let some of the women 
who are brainweary with devising tempting dishes for the 
good man of the house take this matter to heart, and if 
they are able to change their husbands from gourmands 
to athletes a ripe old age is not unlikely. 

On the other hand, those of full habit who give un- 
checked and hearty indulgence to their appetites, should 
always keep in mind the words Shakespeare puts into the 
mouth of sweet "Portia's" wise maid: "They are as sick 
that surfeit with too much, as they that starve with noth- 
ing. ' 

Two Meals a Day.— Many have an erroneous idea that 
If they eat often and a little at a time their body 
IS better nourished and their strength better kept up by 
so doing. There never was a greater mistake made "than 
this constant lunching, the advice of many doctors to do

so notwithstanding. \Vc have known some of the worst

however in a cw weeks by a rigid adherence to two 
meas a day and not even taking the least thing between 
meals We have now in niiiul many cases of greatly im- 
proved health and those who have regained perfect 
health by strict conformity to the two-meal system. 
r.^A}T ^'fe<'-~^specially tor people over Hfiy years 
old and for those of sedentary habits would we recommend 
this system of eating, as it gives the digestive organs the 
needed rest they must have in order to properly and 
thoroughly digest and assimilate the food which goes to 

Stn^L !t'H'^ ^""^^ ^'?^ ^'^'-" "' strength to live. Nature 
ntended that we should cat to live, not, as is too often 
the practice, live to eat. 

A Vegetable Diet — Many noted physicians have in 
recent years recommended a strictly vegetable diet. It is 

nfJn n""!. ^.''lf^''*'']''*' '^15^ '^^^'■ ^^"^'' ^">ted to sustain 
man ni h^aMh, and enable him to be fully what he was 
intended to be, than animal food or a mixed diet This 
view may be contradicted, but experience has taught us 
that many persons would have better health if they were 
to subsist upon a vegetable diet rather than to partake 
so largely of flesh. ^ 

Life Prolonged. -Dr. Lambe, a noted English physi- 
cian says that life is prolonged in incurabte diseases 
about one-tenth by vegetable diet. He has observed no ill 
consequences from the relinquishment of animal food. The 
apprehended danger of the change is only a scare, the 
danger being all the other way. While many may not ■ 
agree with this opinion, a practical application will demon- 
strate Its worth to all who are sufficiently interested. Er- 
rors in diet are the great sources of disease. Amendment 
of diet is the great basis of recovery. Medicines may re- 
heve or suspend the majority of diseases, but medicines 
can never cure without the aid of regimen. 

Eating When Tired.— Some very severe attacks of in- 
digestion people bring on themselves by eating heartily 
when in an exhausted condition. A hearty meal stimu- 
lates the tired heart momentarily, and so tempts one to fill 
the stomach inordinately full. Often the hunger of de- 



Evi/s of Ovct'cating. 4g 

pleted nerves and brain is oonftisod with IimiKor for more 
than a nx^ierate amount of food. Self-control is at its 
ebb, anyhmv, when one is very tired. Hence, we need 
to cstabhsh ourselves in a clear idea on this matter, and 
have It ready for application on occasion. 

Best Uoforo Entliijr. A very short period of rest puts 
the system into much better condition for Rrapplintr with 
food. Take a glass of hot milk and sit down for five 
or ten mmutes no matter how tired and hungry Then 
bcRin to eat slowly, masticatinK thoroughly. In a little 
while the vigor of the stomach will return, and if one 
leaves off at a reasonable point, all will be well If very 
tired it IS better to make a very simple, light meal, and 
take some sleep before attempting to digest all the food 
required for building up the waste. 

Will Power.- It requires a good deal of will power to 
control the appetite at such times, when it seems almost 
a sort of duty to indulge in anything that relieves the sense 
of goneness If one has missed a meal and been long 
without food. It is even then risky to take suddenly all 
the food one can hold. The over-hungry stomach cannot 
do -is much as the stomach that is just fairly hungry 
t IS much better in such a case to take a little, give it time 
to be dissolved, and then take more. A good deal depends 
on the sort of work that has been done and the physical 
vigor of the individual. h"J'o««-'*» 

Hruln Work.- Where severe brain work has been done 

to bring one to the "tired-and-hungry" condition more 
care is required in eating, especially with a person of 
delicate organization. Prof. Draper used to emphasize 
he fact that any highly organized animal or man was 
liable to mjury by abuses which an animal or man of 
.coarser organization could suflfer with apparent impunity 
He instanced the well-known cases in which halfwitted 
or stupid men are known to indulge in practices that 
\youId promptly wreck a man of high nervous organiza- 
tion, and yet without seeming to suflfer.

Conditions of Health. 



CONDITIONS OF HEALTH. 

The organs which are the great sources of health — the 
organs of purification and invigoration, are to a great 
extent, within our reach and control. These are the skin, 
the lungs and the stomach. We can keep the skin clean, 
warm, and active. We can breathe, plentifully, of pure 
air, night and day. We can live on simple, natural, health- 
ful food, enough and not too much. We can drink the 
purest water we can get. These are the chief necessaries 
of life, and conditions of health. 

Yalue of Health. — No man can enjoy life, or perform its 
duties worthily, without health; nor can a man give what 
he does not possess to his posterity. Health is above 
gold and rubies. Better give a child a good constitu- 
tion than all other wealth. 

Ignorance. — Great masses of people are ignorant of the 
laws and conditions of health. Multitudes are suffering 
from diseases that could easily be prevented. The reme- 
dy for ignorance is useful knowledge, the remedy for 
poverty is industry and economy, the remedy for disease is 
a knowledge of the laws of health. 

Economics of Health.— Think of the vast number of 
physicians, surgeons, medical men, chemists, hospitals 
and dispensaries, all living on disease — disease that in 
many cases occurs through the evil habits and vices of 
the people. Good, simple, natural habits of living give 
health and long life, so that many persons may pass 
through life from the cradle to the grave without sickness 
or pain, without doctors or drugs. All disease is un- 
natural and preventable. 

Wealth and Position are not necessary to a high degree 
of health and a low death rate. Health is in the reach 
of all if poisonous narcotics, spiritous drinks, heating 
condiments and spices, and other poisonous matter are 
barred out of the system and the great purifying organ 
of the body — the skin — is kept free, clean, and its pores 
open by frequent bathing. 

Health-Purity.— Purity of birth »s the source of health 
There have been many holy souls in very sickly bodies 
who are martyrs, killed by ignorance, or by generation: 
of unwise or wicked ancestors. Again, no one can main- 
tain or regain health without purity of thought, and conse- 
quent purity of life. To have a sound mind in a sound 
body, both must be pure and chaste. Chastity is a con- 
dition of health.

Conditions of Health. 



Painters suffer from the action of lead and from the 
fumes of the spirits of turpentine which they constant- 
ly inhale. Painters are rarely advanced in years. They 
should be paid double ordinary wages, if health is to be 
measured by money. 

Miners are iiijured by want of light, dampness, foul air, 
and the particles of dust to which they are exposed. 

Soldiers have some advantages over other occupations, 
but in time of peace they suffer from a lack of some- 
thing to do, and become dyspeptic and in time they are 
often subjected to exposures and irregular habits. The 
life of the soldier does not tend to longevity. 

Tailors suffer much from dyspepsia and from consti- 
pation. Plenty of exercise in the open air would greatly 
improve their condition. 

Seamstresses, on account of small pay, close houi s, and 
entire neglect of exercise, are to be pitied much more than 
tailors. 

Okiks, Accountants, and Copyists are often suffering 
from vant of light, bad air, and a too close application 
to thcir work. A frequent changing of position is de- 
sJrab?°, (the standing position is much more favorable 
to health than the sitting position, provided only one 
position can be chosen. 

Convicts are as a class free from disease and are often 
cured of dyspepsia by the plain food and regular habits 
requiicd of them. Epidemics very seldom scale prison 
walls, although they may prevail in prison localities. This 
fact ought not to create a longing to be within prison 
walls, but is a powerful argument in favor of simplicity 
of food, regularity of habits and employment, and tem- 
perance in all things. 

Idlers. — Idleness is not conducive to health, happiness, 
or longevity. He who has no regular employment is in- 
clined to despondency and dyspepsia. Man in his 
healthiest and happiest state has regular employment. 
The retired farmer who enjoys life most and lives longest 
is the one who regularly keeps himself engaged at some- 
thing that gives exercise to his mental and bodily powers. 
Both extremes of idleness and of overwork should be 
avoided, but the more baneful results are the products of 
idleness. Richter says, "I have fire-proof, perennial enjoy- 
ments called employments."

mmutes in rest to improve i..eir nerves and their beauty? 
Good health is of vastly more importance than intellectu- 
ality, for of what comfort to its possessor, or to any 
one else, is the most brilliant mind which lives in a weaiy 
or nervous body? Sheer weariness causes more trouble 
in the world than it ever gets blamed for. A rested per- 
son other things being right, is a pleasant one; while a 
tired person, under whatever other advantageous circum- 
stances, is almost sure to be cross. Many a family 
wrangle has itarted from a few sharp words caused bv 
overstrained nerves. 

Personal Appearance.— It is natural— and perfectly right 
—for a vvoman always to consider her personal appearance 
of great importance. That fact should cause the subject of 
rest to find favor, as those who are always a little overtired 
never look well. Their faces assume a worried, frowning 
expression, a..d wrinkles, gray hairs, dull eyes and sallow 
complexion follow in natural succession. 

The Best Rest.-VVould you keep your fresh com- 
plexion, and plumpness, and bright eyes? Then resti 
Rest often, and rest in the right way. L o not insist that 
change of occupation is rest. There is no greater delu- 
sion. It is nothing of the kind. It simply varies the 
kind of fatigue— adds another different i-^ location The 
best rest, the only real rest, is found in a recumbent posi- 
tion. No one can stand or sit without holding com- 
paratively taut some muscles, and the tension tires them 
and the nerves by sympathy. To rest, lie down on some- 
thing entirely comfortable, and relax every nerve and 
muscle as much as possible. This is not altogether easy 
to do at first, but "practice makes perfect." The rest of it 
IS wonderful— m fact, the whole secret of rest lies in th^ 
one word: relaxation. Notice a baby's or an animal's 
complete relaxation while it sleeps. Five minutes at a 
time several times a day— and more if possible— of such 
rest will certainly add to length of life and happiness. 

False Economy.-Many people think that they cannot 
afford to he down m the daytime, or if they do that they 
must improve the time by reading. It is a false idea of 
an economy of time. Neither the reading nor the resting

But to take little rests— lying down— does not waste time: 
It IS time mvested in a way that pays big dividends

' Laughter 

LAUGHTER A GREAT TONIC. 



Keeps the Spirit Buoyant, the Heart and Face Young. 

"I presume if we laughed more we should all be hap- 
pier and healthier," writes Edward VV. Bok in the Ladies' 
Home Journal 'True, we are a busy and a very prac 
tical people. And most of us probably find more in this 
life to bring the frown than the smile. But, nevertheless 
It IS a pity that we do not laugh more; that we do not 
bring ourselves to the laugh, if need be. 

Best Medicine.- We all agree that a Rood laugh is the 
best medicine m the world. Physicians have said that no 
other feeling works so much good to the entire human 
body as that of merriment. As a digestive, it is unex- 
celled; as a "leans of exp ding the lungs, there is nothing 
better. It keeps the. heart and face young. It is the 
best of all tonics to the spirits. It is, too, the most en- 
joyable of all sensations. 

Better Friends.— A good laugh makes better friends 
with ourselves and everybody around as, and puts us into 
closer touch with what is best and brightest in our lot in 
lite. It is to be regretted, then, that such a potent agency 

v°*"^P^ °"''^' ^^°^ '^ "°t "lO'^e often used. 

Wot Expensive.— It costs nothing. All other medicines 
are more or less expensive. 'Why/ said an old doctor 
not long ago, 'if people fully realized what it means to 
themselves to laugh, and laughed as they should, ninety 
per cent of the doctors would have to go out of busi- 
ness. Probably when we get a little less busy we shall 
laugh more. For, after all, the difference between gloom 
and laughter is but a step. And if more of us simply 
took a step aside oftener than we do, and rested more, 
we would laugh more. 

Lauprhter, not GigrgrHng.— By laughing I do not mean 
che silly giggle indulged in by some women and so many 
girls and boys, too. There is no. outward mark which 
denronstrates the woman of shallow mind so unmistakably 
as that of giggling. There is no sense in the giggle; no 
benefit to be derived from it. It makes a fool of the 
person, and renders every one about uncomfortable. 

A Healthful Nature.— But just as the giggle is the out- 
come of a small mmd, the hearty laugh is the reflection 
of a healthful nature. What we want is more good 
laughers m the world— not more gigglers."

WHY DON'T YOU LAUliK ? 

Why don't you laugh, young man, when troubles come. 
Instead of sitting round so sour and glum? 

You cannot have all play, 

And sunshine every day; 
When troubles come, I say, why don't you laugh? 

Why don't you laugh? 'Twill ever help and soothe 
Ihe aches and pains. No road in life is smooth; 

There s many an unseen bump, 

And many a hidden stump 
O'er which you'll have to jump. Why don't you laugh? 

Why don't you laugh? Don't let your spirits wilt, 
Don t sit and cry because the milk you've spilt; 

If you would mend it now, 

Pray let me tell you how: 
Just milk another cow! Why don't you laugh? 

Why don't you laugh, and make us all laugh, too, 
And keep us mortals all from getting blue? 

A laugh will aways win; 

If you can't laugh, just grin- 
Come on, let's all join in! Why don't you laugh? 

A CURE FOR THE BLUES. 

Few women, and men as well, ccm honestly say that 
they have never had the "blues." One sometimes sees 
a cheery soul who will deny all knowledge of "doldrums " 
but she IS usually a woman possessed of remarkable health 
and full of business interests, or one who literally has no 
time for moping. Such a woman is proof against any 
foolishness of the sort. 

But foolishness or not, if things go wrong, and if one 
teels tired and worried and discouraged, one is prone 
to become despondent and imaginative and out of sorts 
with the world, and it is then we have to look for that 
silver lining. Usually a good, brisk walk will bring it to 
our notice. The physical exercise and mental distraction 
one hnds m the open air will sweep away the cobwebs 
ot the brain as nothing else can. As a race, we Ameri- 
cans are not fond of walking. We exercise too Httle 
We worry too much. We take life too hard. We wear 
ourselves out in the pursuit of rest. A long, vigorous 
walk every day is the best tonic for mire and body and 
an almost invariable panacea for the "blues"

erously with the poor, and you will be happier and

5. Every good hearty laugh in which a man indulges 
tends to prolong his life, as it makes the blood move more 
rapidly and gives a new and different stimulus to all the 
organs of the body from what it does at other times. So 
let us have all the joy we can. 

SLEEP. 

Sleep in order to be beneficial, must be healthful and 
profound. Sleep produced by artificial means relieves the 
mind of Its activities, but it is neither invigorating nor re- 
freshing, and is of very little value. 

Conditions.--Great care should be taken to have the 
room and bedding comfortable and clean. Sleep on an 
elastic mattress rather than a feather bed, and make sure 
f; '^l'' ""i, f *• ^i ^^^'^c'se and rubbing will not warm them, 
try the hot and cold foot-bath, alternately. A hot water 
bottle is better than cold feet. A window let down an 
inch from the top insures a change of air with no draft 
A cool room is best. Take the position that gives most 
comfort, and sleep with the mouth shut. Avoid overheat- 
ing any part, but especially the lower portion of the spine. 
It a stomach-cough comes on after going to bed, drink a 
t^r^L^'l f^'^r^t^- To allay a cough from bronchitis, 
wring half a towel out of cold water, and spread it two 
thicknesses over the chest, covering with the dry part. 
In most cases it will arrest the cough at once, and give 
quiet sleep. As a rule no invalid should eat within four 
hours of bedtime. 

Not DisturDed.— The sleeper should not be disturbed 
until he wake« of his own accord. This, of course, will 




M 



Sleep. 



not apply to lazy persons, and those in danger of contract- 
ing bad habits in this respect. 

WroHliife' Children should, if possible, be permitted to 
sleep at wdl. Retiring at an early hour will generally 
break the tendency to bad habits in respect to rising. 

The Need of Sleep.— Why can some men sleep at will, 
and some "nervous" men, too, while others, sometimes 
very "heavy" men, with apparently immovable nerves, are 
tortured by insomnia? Why, too, do some men seem to 
obtain sufficient rest with five hours' sleep, while others 
require nine? Do some men "sleep slow,' as Mr. Smed- 
ley jocularly argued in one of his amusing stories, or do 
they actually require more sleep? We cannot answer the 
question any more than the doctors can, but we agree on 
one side of the subject most heartily with the "British 
Medical Journal." 

Popular Prejudice. — The popular prejudice against 
sleep works infinity of mischief. There are plenty of slug- 
gards even among the cultivated class, but the sleep slug- 
gard is in that class a very rare specimen. 

The Educated.— The tendency of the educated is to 
wakefulness, and the man who does intellectual work 
and exhibits what his friends think a disposition to over- 
sleep, is obeying a healthy instinct. Sleep recuperates 
him, and he knows it. The popular notion that a young 
man who works with his head, yet sleeps for nine hours, 
is a sluggard, is popular nonsense. No man whose brain 
is active and who does not drink ever sleeps more than 
is good for him. 

Early Sleep.— One hour's sleep gotten before midnight 
is worth two after the midnight hour is past. If those 
troubled with nervous prostration would try the experi- 
ment and thus avoid late suppers their nerves would soon 
relax and the system would soon regain its normal con- 
dition. No one can have perfect health without the neces- 
sary sleep of from seven to ten hours every dav, and from 
three to five of these should be put in before twelve 
o'clock at night. 

Unaired Sleeping-Rooms.— Headache, nervousness, and 
a long list of evils follow in the wake of unaired sleeping- 
rooms. Drafts cause equally undesirable complications. 
Beds should not be placed in the direct line between win- 
dows and doors. Some prudent housewives have four 
small screws placed on the window sashes, two at the 
top on each side and two below them, about five inches. 
When the window is lowered to this depth every night, 



Slerp. 



Sf. 



a iort of screen made of veiling is fastened by mean'; ot 
strings to the screws. Tlii;; permits fresh air to enter 
freely, but prevents a strong wind from blowing against 
the sleepers. 

H.JW to Induce Sleep.— Lengthen the respiration— in 
other words, breathe slower by taking deeper breaths and 
expiring the air slowly— and think of the slow rise of the 
chest, etc. These two things will bring sleep, but why? 
Slower breithing, of course, means lessened bodily activi- 
ty, so that is simple. But how does thinking of the chest 
mduce sleep? 

Thinking of a thing implies that our bodily as well as 
mental gaze is fixed on it; to gaze on one's chest the eye- 
balls must be directed downwards. Those who suffer 
from insomnia and continually go over the events of the 
past day (as such do), will find on personal examination 
that their eye-balls are directed upwards; "to think" it 
is almost imperative such' should be the case; direct the 
eyes downwards, and keep them so, and "thinking" is not 
so easy. 

It has been recommended that the imagination should 
conceive the breath issuing from the nostrils; this breath 
has no shape or form, and hence is, perhaps, a better 
"object" than the chest. Years ago I learnt to do this, 
though I did not then know the explan.tion. Practice 
no longer necessitates my conceiving such objects as the 
breaith or chest, or feet, or bed-foot, or anything below the 
level cf the eyes. I can compel my eye-balls to turn down 
at wil'. It was not easy to get into at first— far from it; 
but I was determined to drop the bromide, and chanced to 
hear of this suggestion. 

I am now the envy of friends; though over fifty, I sleep 
for eight hours arid sometimes ten, and a most refreshing 
sleep, too. Dreams do not— they cannot— trouble one 
who sleeps; only "out-of-sortedness" will cause dreams or 
broken sleep. I know the plan is a good one. 

BICYCLE EXERCISE. 

Bicycle Exercise.— To get the real benefit a bicycle can 
give, don't race, or attempt phenomenal distances. Walk 
up the severe hills, i. e., those (depending on the person), 
which cause the slightest inconvenience in breathing. 
Avoid going with riders who are stronger than you, as 
you are then about certain to overdo. Sit erect. V/eaf 
loose woolen clothing. Go, if possible, into an interest-

Be Good to Yourself. 



ing country, so as to have occasion for little detours afoot, 
oft the road, and so vary the exercise. Go alone if you can 
not with some one who will stop and rest when you feel 
like it. 

BE GOOD TO YOURSELF. 

Think deliberately of the house you live in — your body. 

Make up your mind firmly not to abuse it. 

Eat nothing that will hurt it; wear nothing that dis- 
torts or pains it. 

Do not overload it with victuals or drink or work. 

Give yourself regular ana abundant sleep. 

Keep your body warmly clad. 

At the first signal of danger from the thousand ene- 
mies that surround you, defend yourself 

Do not take cold; guard yourself against it; if you feel 
the first symptoms, give yourself heroic treatment. 

Get into a fine glow of heat by exercise. 

Take a vigorous walk or run, then guard against a sud- 
den attack of perspiration. 

Tliis is the only body you will ever have in this world 

A large share of the pleasure and pain of life will come 
through the use you make of it. 

Study deeply and diligently the structure of it, the laws 
that should govern it, and the pains and penalties that will 
surely follow a violation of every law of life or health. 

AS I GROW OLD. 

If need be, take my friends, my dole of wealth. 

Take faith, and love, and hope lake youth and health; 

But while I live, dear God, blight not the flower 

Of reason in my brain! Leave me the power 

To string together, on fine threads of gold, 

My fairest thoughts, as I grow gray and old.

regular life, cdting plain food and retired without allow- 
ing the cares of the day to interrupt their rest or sleep. 

4. Highly seasoned food, and luxuries of any kind al- 
ways tend to excesses which produce premature decay 
I'or some years past, reported deaths from "Hqart Fail- 
ure have become -frequent and fashionable among prac- 
ticing physicians, and perhaps the report may have been 
true, but not the whole truth, for it is probable that in 
nine cases out of ten the heart failure was secondary and 
brought on by an ineffectual efTort of the stomach or ali- 
mentary tract to cast ofT indigestible matter clogging the 
way, caused by excesses of over-eating or over-nervous 
strains. 

5. Bright's disease, that most miserable misnamed dis- 
ease. If statistics could be kept showing the real cause of 
all deaths occurring between the ages of forty-five and 
seventy-five, the result in all probability would prove that 
more than half fall victims to disease engendered by stom- 
ach difficulties, brought on by too high living, excesses in 
both eating and drinking. 

• \ ^^^ ^^^** °^ constipation is another serious obstacle 
in the way of long life. Its progress is slow and so insid- 
ious as to beguile the sufferer into the belief that it is not 
pernicious or worthy of attention; and so apprehension is 
lulled, while the foundation of some fatal chronic disease 
involving important organs is being laid. 

7. When troubled with constipation it is usual to resort 
to purgatives, which afford temporary relief, but usually 
nave a tendency to confirm the disease. Injections are 
sometimes used, with no better results, for besides being a 
bungling remedy they have' no permanent influence in 
overcoming the habit. Bread made of unbolted rye c 
wheat meal is an excellent remedy, but, not being in com- 
mon use, few patients can be sure of getting it regularly, 
especially if engaged in active pursuit, as many are. Be- 
fore the habit is firmly established, eating fruit desserts at 
dinner every day is apt to afford some relief, and if there 
is no habit of constipation it may act as a preventive. 
Baked apples are excellent for constipation. Eating a fair- 
sized baked apple (warm or cold) at the beginning of each 
meal three times a day, has cured many very obstinate 
cases of constipation. It is a very palatable and cheap 
remedy, and much more certain and effective than strong 
drugs. 

8. To suggest the methodical use of cold water as a bev- 
erage in the absence of thirst, as a means of augmenting 
the chances of longevity, might seem to render one liable 
to be called a crank, if not a lunatic; nevertheless the idea

claims a physiological origin, and is well supported by ex- 
perience Solid and dry as the human body appears, water 
constitutes more than three-fourths of its bulk, and all the 
liinctions of life are carried on in a water-bath. And al- 
though the sense of thirst may be trusted to call for a 
draught of cold water when required, that offers no reason 
why vv^ may not be benefited by it in the absence of thirst 

9. Drinking cold water as a beverage between meals is

Cleanliness. 



CLEANLINESS. 

Cleanliness. — The Dutch are the cleanliest people in 
the world, and the latest published statistics stiow that 
Holland, in proportion to its population, is the most moral 
nation on the globe. It is very easy to find a direct con- 
nection between the cleanliness of a people and their moral 
standard. 

Tidiness*— Of all the external aids to amoral life none 
is so potent as tidiness. An untidy man or woman soon 
becomes a moral sloven. Let a man be careless of his 
surroundings, of his companionships, of his dresa, his gen- 
eral appearance and of his bodily habits, and it is not long 
before the same carelessness extends into the realm of 
his morals. 

Our Snrronudlngs.— We are all creatures of our sur- 
roundings, and we work and act as we feel. If a man 
lives in a home where carelessness or untidiness in his 
dress is overlooked, he very soon goes from one inex- 
actitude to another. He very quickly loses himself. The 
moral fiber of a man, fine of itself, can soon become 
coarse if the influence of his external surroundings is 
coarse. I believe thoroughly in the effect of a man's dress 
and habits of person upon his moral character. I do not 
say that neatness of appearance and cleanliness of person 
constitute the gentleman or the man of honor. But I do 
say that they are potent helps. And I would like to em- 
phasize the importance of this belief upon the women of 
our homes. For it is given them to be an important fac- 
tor in these helps to the betterment of the world's moral- 
ity. 

Business Men. — The average American man is a busy 
creature, and amid the larger business affairs which absorb 
him he is apt to be neglectful of smaller things. And these 
smaller things generally take the form of a neglect of per 
sonal habits. 

Woman's Inf uence.— Here is where the wife, mother 
or sister comes in. The American woman is very largely 
responsible for the appearance of our men. The bet- 
ter the appearance of our men the higher will be the stand- 
ard of morality, the more potent our influence as a 
nation. I have often looked at men in business and 
wondered where their wives were when they left home. 
Unshaved, practically unwashed, save for a few splashes 
of water in the face, with either frayed or soiled linen, 
Vt'ith clothes unbrushed or shoes unblacked.. they appear 
at their places of business. 



Cleanliness.

Developed or Neglected—Now a man rardy works 
better than he looks; certainly never better Hv,nl.« 
.eels. And if a man feels unkempt, the work he do ' 
will probably be of the same Rrade. If, on the other 
hand, he feels clean, he works clean. The feeling o? the

body and dress, or either. He works at a distinct ad- 
vantage. Tlie external man unquestionably influences the 
internal man. 

The Morning Bath.— I would give far more for the 
work done by a man who has the invigorating moral 
tonic of a morning bath and the feeling of clean linen 
than I would for the work done by a man who scarcely 
washes, and rushes into his clothes. Where the bath- 
tub has as yet iiot made its appearance, the vigorous 
morning "rub-down" is a substitute within the reach of 
every man. 

A Hasty Beginning.— A man begins his day badly 
when he hurries and rushes at the beginning of it. The 
men who have tried both ways know best how potent 
a factor in their lives is a reasonable time of leisure 
between their rising and their departure for business. 
The time spent upon our bodies is never wasted; on 
the contrary, it is time well invested. A machine of 
metal and steel must be clean before it can do good work. 
So, too, the human machine. A disre^;ard of the l)ody 
and disorder in dress soon grow into moral slovenliness. 
The temper which governs our care of ourselves and 
our appearance soon becomes the temper where moral 
things are concerned. 

A Bad Habit. — Inexactitude grows easily and rapidly, 
It soon becomes a habit in all things. Life travels 
more quickly on the downward grade than it does on the 
upward path. It is so much easier to be neglectful oi' 
small things than it is to be regardful of them. But, 
all the same, it is a wise woman who, careful of the 
small things about the life of the men of her home, keeps 
her husband, son or brother up to his highest standard. 
Her labor will come back to her tenfold. 

Task Mot Easy. — Such a policy is not easy of accom- 
plishment in some cases. There are men who resent what 
they choose to call the "interference" of their wives in 
matters purely personal. But the things of best results 
in this world are always the most difficult ones to 
acquiie. Slovenliness is a hard habit to cure. But it can 
be cured. And the most arduous campaign where a 
man's cleanliness i-nd neatness are concerned is worth 
the results once they are attained. Many men grow 
careless simply from forgetfulness or habit. A mrre 
reminder of their duty to themselves is often all-suf- 
ficient.

When and How.— Dr. Cyrus Edson, ex-PresideiU of 
the New York Board of Health, writes concerning bath- 
ing: "A cold douche or any form of shower bath should 
not be used when a person is tired or exhausted from any 
cause, as the reaction on which the shock depends for its 
beneficial effect does not follow effectually when the system 
is tired. The result of the shower in such a case is apt 
to be internal congestion, which may be disastrous. It 
does not follow, however, that a perspiring person should 
not bathe "ntil cooled off. As a matter of fact, if the per- 
son is not exhausted, the fact that the pores are open is 
rather advantageous than otherwise, as the reaction is 
enhanced and will probably follow more energetically. 

Not Near Meal Time.— A bath should never be taken 
within two hours of a hearty meal. The first eflfect of 
'mmersion in warm or in cold water is to derange seriously 
the digestive process if that is progressing at the time, 
and by a physiological effect that naturally follows, to 
unbalance or derange the whole nervous system. The re- 
sult of this is extremely dangerous to the bather. There 
are numerous instances of severe illness and even of death 
caused by bathing while the stomach was full." 

Danger After Meals. — Sudden immersion of the body 
in cold water after a meal and while the process of diges- 
tion is going on may be attended with danger; at such a 
time the abdominal system is the seat of intense physio- 
logical congestion and the accumulation of blood in it is 
suddenly thrown back toward the nervous centers, and the 
consequence may be a disorder resulting in death. 

Beanty in the Bath.— For a beautiful bath, which is 
very luxurious, the temperature of tlie water should be 
from 70 to 75 degrees, and the bath should be of daily oc- 
currence. With this should be used the bran and almond- 
meal bags, which can be had from any druggist. One for 
much less expense can make them at home by mixing well 
one and one-half pounds of clean, new bran, and one-half 
pound of pulverized orris root, three-quarters of a pound 
of almond meal, and five ounces of grated white Castile 
soap. Make seven-inch cheesecloth bags, and put about 
four ounces into each one, sewing them firmly at the 
edges, using one for each bath, just as you would a 
sponge, without soap. The bran and almond-meal bags 
are luxuries, not necessities, in the bath, and while they 
add softness and fragrance, will not dc away with the 
necessity of scrubbing in order to produce cleanliness.

Bathing. 



!;i 



To Our Girls.— Your skin and your eyes, my dear girl, 
constitute the thermometer that tells whether you are 
well, physically, or not. If the first has little spots upon 
It IS dull to look at, and feels dry, and the second has a 
glazed appearance, with yellowish whites, then be sure it is 
time to think whether you are living rightly from the 
piiysical standpoint. Now, what does your morning bath 
amount to? Do you dab over your face, whirl the cloth 
around your neck, carefully bathe your bnnds, and then 
go out of the bathroom fully satisfied that you are quite 
n u >"^''^ ^'■e thousands of girls who consi4er this 
all that is necessary, and yet,. as the old darky mammy 
would say. 'That s nothing more than a lick ahd a prom- 
ise. 

The Morning Batb.— I do not recommend for any girl 
in this country a perfectly cold bath. American women 
are inclined to be nervous and are not over-strong con- 
sequently the wisest thing to do is to plunge into water 
that is tepid, and which, when one gives one's self a 
thorough rubbing, will not cause the much-to-be-dreaded 
cold. Ihis morning bath is taken for cleanliness, and it is 
the only way, unless, indeed, one stands up and is care- 
tully sponged, by which one can be sure of perfect phys- 
ical sweetness? Use soap? Plenty of it. But this soap 
does not need to be of an expensive Kind, and the wise 
girl is that one who chooses the simplest quality and one 
that is not scented. 

Hot Bath.— A hot bath, which is desirable at least once 
a week, should be taken at night, and the tired girl will 
be surprised to find, not only how restful it is, but how 
perfectly delicious her own body feels when she lies down 
and her eyelids gradually fall over the eyes weary of 
looking all the day long 

Wash CIoth.---The cheap napery that is sold makes a 
good wash cloth, for you must remember that, while the 
sponge is desirable in the bath, something more than a 
sponge IS required to make one absolutely clean. By-the- 
bye, a light quality of flannel, one combining cotton with 
wool, is also desirable for a cloth. It is only after one 
has grown accustomed to the morning bath that one 
realizes all that it means, how, in the best way, it wakens 
one up, mentally and phy--ally, and starts one out ready 
to begin the work of anouier day. 

A Hot Bath Brings Sleep.— Suppose a person be tired 
out by overwork of any kind, to feel nervous, irritable, and 
worn, to be absolutely certain that bed means only tossing 
tor hours in an unhappy wakefulness. We all know this 



11

condition of the body and mind. Turn on the hot water 
in the bathroom and soak in the hot bath until the 
drowsy feeling comes, which will be within three minutes; 
rub yourself briskly with a coarse Turkish towel until the 
body IS perfectly dry, and then go to bed. You will sleep 
the sleep of the just, and rise in the morning wondering 
how you could have felt so badly the night before. The 
bath has saved many a one from a sleepless night, if not 
from a severe headache the next day. 

A Healthful Practice.— As a rule, every person should 
take a daily bath— some kind of a wash all over the body. 
After the teeth, face, neck and hands have been cleansed 
it is a good practice to take a sponge or towel bath, fol- 
lowed by a vigorous rubbing with a rough towel. It is a 
good rule to first wet the head. 

Systematic Bathing is undoubtedly the best of all pre- 
ventives agaii;st all ordinary diseases and equally so 
against epidemics, as the following facts from official au- 
thority clearly show: During the fatal visitation of the 
cholera in Paris and Lyons in 1832, out of 16,218, sub- 
scribers to the public baths only two deaths among them 
could be traced to cholera. Comment is unnecessary. 

The Skin.—The entire skin with its immense network 
of nerves and myriads of pores, should be made and kept 
clean by daily bathing and friction. A hot rubbing bath, 
with soap, may be followed by a pouring or sponging 
with cold water; then dry with towels and plenty of rub- 
bing. 

Patients.— All patients need some kind of bath daily— a 
washing of the whole body with sponge, towel, the hands 
or m any convenient manner. Persons who chill may be 
first washed with vrarm water and then quickly sponged 
over with cold. A brisk rubbing will not fail to bring on 
a reaction and a toning up of the nerves. 

The Cleansing Bath.— This should be taken at least onre 
a week. With sponge or towel or the hand apply waria 
water over the body. Then soap until there is a perfect 
lather. Then water and soap and finish with a sponge or 
towel b.ith of cold water, followed by a good rubbing 
with dry towels. 

The Towel Bath.— This can be taken when one can get 
a pint of water and two towels. Fold one towel and dip it 
into the water. Squeeze out some so that you do not wet 
the floor. Wash face and head as far as you can reach, and 
the two arms, then more water and wash the front of 
the oody and the thighs. Now open the length of the 
towel wet ali the middle portion, and, taking it by the tvro

ends, ,-)ass it over tlie neck and saw all down tlie back, 
fold iii four and have another dash down in front qnd finish 
with legs and feet. Now wipe dry, and rub briskly all 
over with a dry towel, the rougher the better. 

Prevention Against Colds.— A daily towel bath, which 
can be taken in any carpeted room, without spilling a drop 
of water, is an excellent prevention against cold, helps the 
appetite and digestion, and is a good means of preventing 
constipation. 

llonctlon. — Within a reasonable time after a bath the 
body in all its parts should become naturally warm. If this 
is not the case the bath has done no good. 

Exercise.— Exercise should be taken after the bath until 
circulation is fully restored. Where this cannot be done 
friction by rubbing should take its place. 

PRACTICAL RULES FOR BATHING. 

1. Bathe at least once a week all over, thoroughly. No 
one can preserve his health by neglecting personal clean- 
liness. Remember, "Cleanliness is akin to Godliness." 

2. Only mild soap should be used in bathing the body. 

3. Wipe quickly and dry the body thoroughly with a 
moderately coarse towel. Rub the skin vigorously. 

4. Many people have contracted severe and fatal dis- 
eases by neglecting to take proper care of the body after 
bathing. 

5. If you get a good reaction by thoro'-qhly rubbing in 
a mild temperature, the effect is always good. 

6. Never go into a cold room, or allow cold air to enter 
the room until you are dressed. 

7. Bathing in cold rooms and in cold water is positively 
injurious, unless the person possesses a very strong and 
vigorous constitution, and then there is great danger of 
laying the foundation of some serious disease. 

8. Never bathe within two hours after eating. It injures 
digestion. 

9. Never bathe when the body or mind is much ex- 
hausted. It is liable to check the healthful circulation. 

10. A good time for bathing is just before retiring. The 
morning hour is a good time also, if a warm room and 
warm water can be secured. 

11. Never bathe a fresh wound or broken skin with cold 
water; the wound absorbs water, and causes swelling and 
irritation. 

12. A person not robust should be very careful in bath- 
ing; great care should be exercised to avoid any chilling 
effects. 



.■U/ (III- Different Kinds of Balfis. 

ALL THE DIKFKRENT KINDS OF nVTHS, AND 
HOW TO I'llKl'AKE THEM. 



.^« 



THE SULPHUR BATH. 

For the itch, ringworm, itching, and for other slight 
skin irritationti, bathe in water containing a Httle sulphur. 

THE SALT BATH. 

To open the pores of the skin, put a little common salt 
into the water. Borax, baking soda or lime used in the 
same way are excellent for cooling and cleansing the skin. 
A very small quantity in a bowl of water is sufficienl. 

THE VAPOR BATH. 

I. For catarrh, bronchitis, pleurisy, inflammation of the 
lungs, rheumatism, fever, affections of the bowels and 
kidneys, and skin diseases, the vapor bath is an excellent 
remedy. 

3. Apparatus. — Use a small alcohol lamp and place 
over it a .-mall dish containing water. Light the lamp and 
allow the water to boil. Place a cane-bottom chair over 
the lamp, and seat the patient on it. Wrap blankets or 
quilts around the chair and around the patient, closing it 
tightly about the neck. After free per>piration is pro- 
duced the patient should be wrapped in warm blankets and 
placed in bed, so as to continue the perspiration for 
some time. 

3. A convenient alcohol lamp may be made by taking 
a tin box, placing a tube in it, and putting in a common 
lamp wick. Any tinner can make one in a few minutes 
at a trifling cost. 

THE HOT-AIR BATH. 

1. Place the alcohol lamp under the chair, without the 
dish of water. Then place the patient on the chair, as in 
the vapor bath, and let him remain until a gentle and 
free perspiration is produced. This bath may be taken 
from time to time, as may be deemed necessary. 

2. While remaining in the hot-air bath the patient 
may drink freely of cold or tepid water. 

3. As soon as the bath is over the patient should be 
washed with hot water and soap. 

4. The hot-air bath is excellent for colds, skin diseases, 
and *he gout.

m 



All the Different Kinds of Bal/is. 
THE SPONGE BATH. 



1. Ha\ e a large basin of water of the temperature of 88 
or 95 degrees. As soon as the patient rises rub the body 
over with a soft, dry towel until it becomes warm, 

2. Now sponge the body with water and a little soap, 
at the satTie time keeping the body well covered, except 
such portions as are necessarily exposed. Then dry the 
skin carefully with a soft, warm towel. Rub the skin 
well for two or three minutes, until every part becomes 
red and perfectly dry. 

3. Sulphur, lime or salt, and sometimes mustard, may 
be used in any of the .sponge-baths, according to the 
disease. 

THE FOOT BATH. 

1. The foot-bath, in coughs, colds, asthma, headaches 
and fevers, is excellent. One or two table-spoonfuls of 
ground mustard added to a gallon of hot water, is very 
beneficial. 

2. Heat the water as hot as the patient can endure it, 
and gradually increase the temperature by pouring in ad- 
ditional quantities of hot water during the bath. 

THE SITZ BATH. 

A tub is arranged so that the patient can sit down in 
it while bathing. Fill the tub about one-half full of water. 
This is an excellent remedy for piles, constipation, head- 
ache, gravel, and for acute and inflammatory affections 
"generally. 

THE ACID BATH. 

Place a little vinegar in water, and heat to the usual 
temperature. This is an excellent remedy for the disor- 
ders of the liver. 



A SURE CURE FOR PRICKL\ HEiT. 

I. Prickly heat is caused by hot weather, by excess of 
flesh, by rough flannels, by sudden changes of tempera- 
ture, or by over-fatigue. 

3. Treatment.— Bathe two or three times a day with 
warm water, in which a moderate quantity of bran and 
common soda has been stirred. After wipiner the skin dry, 
dust the affected parts with common corn starch.

served as halted almonds. 

Eggs contair a large amount of nutriment in a compact 
quickly available form. Eggs, especially the yolks of eggs 
are useful in jaundice. Beaten up raw with sugar are 
used to clear and strengthen the voice. With sugar and 
lemon juice, the beaten white of egg is used to relieve 
hoarseness.

Apples are useful in nervous dyspepsia; they are nu- 
tritious, medicinal, a-l vitalizing; they aid digestion, clear 
the voice, correct the acidity of the stomach, are valuable 
in rheumatism, insomnia, and liver troubles. An apple 
contains as much n-jtriment as a potato in a pleasanter

Health Rules. 



73 



PRACTICAL HEALTH RULES. 

1. It is no doubt a fact that health is at the command of 
most people. If people are sick, it is generally their fault, 
and not their misfortune. It is the violation of the laws 
of health that produces disease. 

2. The average life in America would be about eighty 
years if proper care were taken of the mind and body; at 
present it is only thirty-four years. 

3. To avert cold feet, wear two pairs of stockings, one 
pair of cotton or silk, the other of wool, and the natural 
heat of the feet will be preserved if they are kept clean. 

4. Late hours and anxious pursuits exhaust the system, 
and produce disease and premature death. Therefore the 
hours of labor and hard study combined should be short. 

5. Be moderate in eating and drinking; eat simply and 
plain food, avoid strong drink, tobacco, snuff, opium, 
and every excess, and your life will be lengthened many 
years. 

6. A mild temper, and a serene and p'acid disposition 
will preserve heaith and lengthen life. 

7. Never eat at irregular intervals. Regularity of meals 
is a necessity if dyspepsia and other forms of indiges- 
tion are to be avoided. Some persons are continually 
munching cakes, apples, nuts, candies, etc. This prac- 
tice cannot be too severely condemned. 

8. Never overload the stomach. Eating too much is 
about as bad as swallowing the food whole. The svomach 
is unable to digest ,the food, and it consequently ferments 
and produces disease. 

9. Late suppers should always be avoided. Persons who 
indulge in hearty suppers never secure as sound sleep as 
those who eat lightly early in the evening. 

10. Food should always be of good quality. Stale veg- 
etables, which have lain in the market and withered for 
a long time, or fruit that is not perfect, is very injurious 
to the health. 

11. One of the most es.sential things to health is a 
regular and vigorous system of bathing. Remember that 
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness."

BENEATH THE FINGER NAILS.

How to Tell Infectious Diseases. 



75 



The Idea that there is danger in being scratched by 
another person has no significance as far as the nail itself 
IS concerned. The danger lies not in the nail, but in pos- 
sible bacteria under the nail, so that a self-infl cted scratch 
may be as bad as any other. !»i-ratcn 

Biting the finger nails is a bad habit, for there is the 
nsk of swallowing the germs of some infectious disease 
Ine nails have a tendency to gather particles of dust and 
dirt that may be full of germs. The best method of cleans- 
ing the nails IS with a brush and plenty of soap and water 
A slight scratch with a pin or needle under the nad has 
often resulted m introducing germs that have brought on 
the painful felon or whitelow.

76 The Wonderful Revelations of tae Microscope, 
The WoiHlerful llevdatioiis of the Mieroscope. The Piscoverj 
of the Invisible Assailants of Health. 

The microscope has revealed a 
new kingdom of invisible life. The 
air we breathe, the water we drink, 
the air above us and the earth be- 
neath us, are filled with countless 
myriads of little bodies, known as 
"microbes," "bacteria," "bacilli," 
etc. They are the most insidious, 
relentless and pov>'erfnl -nemies to 
human life, and desi,„y more lives 
than war, famine, fire, murder, ship- 
wreck, and all other casualties com- 
bined. There is scarcely a disease 
known to mankind which is not 
due to the entrance of these "mi- 
crobes" into the body. Disease is 
simply the manifestation of their 
presence. They feed upon the 
blood and tissue until destroyed, or death destroys their 
victim. 

All acute contagious diseases, such as om- .i-pox, chick- 
en pox, scarlet fever, typhus fever, measles, influenza, 
whooping cough, hydrophobia, etc., are the results of 
living microbes, which have gained access to the blood 
or tissue. 

Another class of microbes, says Dr. Samuel Hart, are 
called miasmatic contagions. The germs are propagated 
in diseased persons, but, as a law of their further de- 
velopment, they must undergo one change outside of the 
body, in some decomposing organic body, before they 
can again produce their peculiar disease in healthy per- 
sons except by inoculation. Typhoid fever, yellow fever, 
cholera, diphtheria, acute consumption, erysipelas, etc., 
belong to this class of disease. 

When the microbes originate entirely in decomposing 
matter, continues Dr. Hart, the diseases caused are in- 
termittent fever, remittent fever, continued malarial fever, 
etc.

HOW MICROBES OR BAQTERIA ATTACK 
THE BODY. 

Microbes gain access to the Human body principally 
ihrough the mouth, but they may also effect an entrance 
llirough a wound, or even an inviliible breach of the skin's 
surface. They set up a disease/ each after its kind, by 
lighting up a fire of inflammation in the place where they 
take up their quarters, and by mahufacturing poisonous pro. 
ducts which intensify t}ie mischief. 

Pursuing their advantage, ; they scatter themselvea 
throughout the body, using the,^lood-vessels as convenient 
channels for the purpose. / 

Taking the lungs as an illuglration. when a microbe whicl> 
engenders consumption gaiijs a footing in those organs, it 
first "squats" so to speak, ifl one spot, and proceeds to cul- 
tivate the ground it has foy'nd, in its own way. The deadly 
seed is sown and a crop hi "tubercles" is the result ; these 
slowly ripen to pursue thib metaphor, and then rot, the con- 
sequence being the com|)lete destruction of the st-ucture of 
the lung at that point, "'

HOW TO BESTROY MICROBES. 

The person, as well as the hou5e and yard, must be kept 
clean. Cold water is, of courso, most useful; but tvery 
man, woman and child ought to take a hot hath about 
once a week, and frequent changes M underclclhing should 
be made. Still more important, perhaps, is the character 
of the drinking-water we consume, for ninety nine oas^'i- 
out of a hundred of typhoid fever are due to coaiammatci 
drini;ing-water. Boiling tor half an hour will make wa .^r 
sulhcientlj' puie for practical safety, which can i!'.,>t l<. 
said of filten.,!", alone. Indeed, if a filter can not be. 
cleaned, instead of being a ble.sing it is a curse, and a 
serious: source of 'Izx^^s.v. The'"' appears to be but one 
satisfactory filter in i'le mailcct. and it is not altogether 
adapted for nse in private )(ouses. 

If there has been sickness in the house, additional pre- 
cautions ought U'i be taken. The paper on the walls of the 
sick-room should be removed and burnt; the walls and 
ceiling should then be washed with a solution consisting 
of one p-irt of bichloride of mercury to 1,000 parts of 
water. This germ-destroyer, often called corrosive subli- 
mate, is a deadly poison, and must be handled with great 
care. All bed-linen and other clothing from the room oc- 
cupied by the sick person sho^' > be boiled for no less 
than three liours, and to every four gallons of water used 
foi' this purpose one pound of sulphate of zinc may be 
added. 

Cats and dogs are a serious source of danger if they 
have been permitted to roam around promiscuously at 
their own sweet will, as they carry the germs of disease 
with them, and quite frequently convey most serious dis- 
orders not only to children, but to grown persons. As 
there is no satisfactory method of sterilizing tnese ani- 
mals, it is best to have none of them about the house un- 
less they can be kept within bounds. 

Fresh air, pure water, and sunshine are the deadly 
microbe's worst enemies, and attention to a few simple 
hygienic rules will enormously lessen the chances of dis- 
ease, while, if a few simple precautions, such as those 
already mentioned, are neglected, the probability of sorr-^ 
microbic disorder attacking some member of the housii 
hold is consiaerably increased.

How to Disinfect a Room. 
HOW TO DISINFECT A ROOM. 



79 



We present our readers with an abstract of a recent 
lecture by J. H. Kellogg, M. D. 

The best means to disinfect a room which has been 
occ'jf-.ed by a consumptive or a person suffering from any 
other infectious disease is to burn sulphur in it To do 
ui.s take a dishpan and place a flat plate in the bottom 
f It Md on this set a kettle containing the proper quanti- 
ty of suiphur mixture-equal quantities of sulphur and 
charcoal Fill he pan with water so that it comes half way 
up on the kettle. Then turn alcohol or benzine on the 
mixture, igmte and get out of the room as speedily as 
possible. Alcohol IS much the best to use, and two ox 
three ounces will be sufficient for several pounds of sul- 

P pin^f^* ^« ''°°"' If "'^'" ^'osed for twenty-four hours 

Previous PreparatIon.-The room should be prepared 
previously by having every crack about doors and win- 
dows tightly pasted or stopped up. The object of using 
water is hat the heat of the Kettle will cause evaporation 
and send moisture out into the room, for the spores 
being very tenacious of life, dry sulphur fumes are not 
sufficient to kill them all. In the dry state the product is 
simply oxide of sulphur, but when water is added we 
have sulphuric acid which is powerful enough to kill the 
spores as well as the germs 

Sufficient Quantity.-It is of the utmost importance 
that a sufficient quantity of the sulphur be used to make 
the work effective. I have seen people attempt to disin- 
fect a large room with a handful of sulphur barely suffi- 
cient to disinfect a dry-goods box. It amounts to nothing 
whatever Ascertain the size of the room, and burn three 
pounds of sulphur for every i,ooo cubic feet of air. Take 
for instance, a room which is 12 by 15 feet floor measure- 

TtQ..^'? .'"-il^-* ?''^^' ^^'f^ S'^^« a cubica' contents 
of ,800 feet. This is so nearly 2,000 that it would be best 

'°-n*u^^ /i^ PP""^s o^ sulphur to disinfect it. 

Chloride of Lime.-Some people distribute a handful of 
chloride of hme about, which gives a sanitary smell but 13 
really of no value. Many strange notions as to disinfec- 
tion prevail, and all sorts of valueless recommendations 
are going the rounds of the papers. For instance, I called 
upon a patient once and found a tub of water under the 
bed, and it was explained to me that it was for the 
purpose of absorbing germs. Others will set powdered 
cnarcoal around on trays, or a little chloride of lime on a

! 



saucer. Some people seem to imagine that the germs are 
going to hunt up the disinfectant and destroy themselves. 
A strong solution of copperas will kill all the germs it 
touches, but not the spores or seeds of the germs. 

Half a pound of chloride of lime to a gallon of water 
makes a good disinfectant to destroy germs in excreta, 
provided the chloride of lime is good, but the most of 
it is poor, having lost its disinfectant properties. 

Corrosive Sublimate.— Another excellent disinfectant is 
corrosive sublimate, but it is too dangerous for common 
use, unless kept under lock and key. It is best used in 
connection with permanganate of potash, one drachm of 
each to a gallon of water. This will make a reddish or 
purplish solution, and if marked poison, and handled 
with care, will be dangerous chiefly to germs. This solu- 
tion is equal to about one part in a thousand of each, 
and the corrosive sublimate will destroy the germs, and 
the permanganate of potash will destroy the odors as well 
as furnish coloring matter. A solution of corrosive sub- 
limate alone is colorless, odorless, and nearly tasteless, 
which facts greatly increase the risks of using it. About 
one part in 20,000 is sufficient to kill germs, but to dis- 
infect excreta it is necessary to use a strong solution, the 
bulk of the disinfectant equaling that of the excreta. 

Clothing. — For disinfecting the clothing from the bed 
and the patient, soak for four hours, either in a solu- 
tion of corrosive sublimate and water or the same length 
of time in a two per cent, solution of carbolic acid. The 
latter is to be preferred for general purposes, for it will 
not afifect the texture, while corrosive sublimate will 
shrink flannel clothing and make it harsh. 

Walls and Floor. — A solution of corrosive sublimate 
may be used to disinfect a room by washing the walls 
and floor in it, but the permanganate of potash must' be 
left out from this as well as from the solution for disin- 
fecting clothing, for it will stain. To set any of these 
things in a room does no good; a disinfectant must be dis- 
tributed to be available. 

A Good Disinfectant.— Dr Stone says: "All authorities, 
I believe, are agreed in giving the preference to chlorine, 
which may be evolved by mixing in a bottle two table- 
spoonfuls of common salt, two tablespoonfuls red lead 
and one-half a wineglassful of strong oil of vitriol in a 
quart of water. The bottle should be kept cool, tightly 
stopped and in a dark place. A little of this fluid exposed 
in a saucer, sprinkled on the floor, or soaked in sheets of

°i ''."^" *"^ ^""g about the rooms, rapidly destroys 
effluvia Green copperas (sulphate of iron) one pound 
dissolved in a gallon of water, is another very excellent 
agent and the same may be said of the fumes of sulphur 
(sulphurous acid) for unoccupied rooms. Chloride of 
lead solution is another potent tiuid; it is cheap, involves 
very little trouble, is instantaneous in its effect and per- 
fectly safe. Indeed, any of the above will be found to 
destroy the rankest compound or villainous smell that ever 
offended the nostril." 

Copperas.— The very best disinfectant and deodorizer 
known is copperas. A double handful dissolved in a 
bucket of water and used to wash drain pipes and re- 
ceptacles of waste material will keep such places above 

^r^M k"- u ^^^ ^^^^^'^ '" pitchers and flower-holders 
should be changed every day. On attention to such seem- 

"T^uiy'^^^^fi^''^ "^ay hang a human life. 

tarbolJc Acid.— When it is required to use carbolic acid 
as a disinfectant, it should be mixed with boiling water 
Fhis promptly overcomes the usual antagonism between 
the acid and the water, and converts them into a perma- 
nent solution which will keep for weeks. 

SANITATION ABOUT THE HOME. 

Cleanliness.— The maxim "Health is wealth" is not ap- 
preciated as a truism; more frequently health is only orized 
as a blessing when it is wanting. The health of the 
household depends upon the scrupulous cleanliness of the 
premises more than upon any other one thing. The 
responsibility for this must largely rest with the house 
mother, she being the one usually more sensible of any 
needed change, and so the plainest and simplest exposi- 
tions of sanitary science should be familiar to her. 

Drains and Slnks.-The location of drains and sinks 
should be carefully considered and their condition fre- 
\"'"fi^, •"jP/'^ted The drain pipe from a kitchen sink 
should lead for rods away from the house and let the out- 
let reach the roots of trees or shrubs which specially 
delight in moisture, as the willow or the quince Never 
use an open box to convey any form of slops. Wood is 
otten used as a conductor pipe, bu^ in a short time it be- 
comes thoroughly saturated with ^ .h, and thus a breeder 
01 -^^sease and a menace to h %■; i . Tile is better than 
Wood, and being porous, much of the moisture oozes out 
as It passes along.

in the course of time. Lead is the best and most durable 
of all, but is also the most expensive. However, if the ex- 
pense of a lead drainage pipe is set over against a doc- 
tor's bill and other expenses incident to sickness, it will 
he cheap in comparison, and who would consider it for a 
moment when weighed against the precious life of some 
member of ti'e family. 

Disinfectant.— Whatever material is used as a conductor, 
the drain should be flushed with some good disinfectant 
solution as often as once a week in warm weather. Cop- 
peras is as good as anything for ordinary u and has 
ihe advantage of being cheap. It can be procured of a 
u;aggist for abot three or five cents a pound. Dissolve 
in the proportion of one-fourth of a pound to a gallon of 
water and use very freely. Plug the outlet and pour 
enough into the sink to fill the pipe its full length. Use 
the solution as near the 1 oiling point as convenient, for 
the reason th. •■ a hot fluid is more penetrating than a cold 
one, an advan ige if tile or wood is used. A hot solu- 
tion IS further . . antagcous as a solvent of whatever waste 
particles may h. e lodged at various points or gathered 
ihc K ugth of the p'oe. Dishwater usually contains more 
or less grease, ani his will be melted and washed out 
if the disinfectant is pourel in hot. Potasl;', sal-soda and 
lye may be used instead copperas. 

ttefrigerators in whic )od is kept should be kept 
scrupulously clean and the pipe conveying the drippings 
from it should be entirely disconnected from the drain- 
age system of the house. Milk and butter should not be 
placed near vegetables, especially those having a strong 
smell. Place a piece of charcoal in your refrigerator. 

A Home Made Filter.— An eminent sanitarian, Dr. 
Parkes, has given directions for a home-made filter for 
drinking water. A large common flower-pot is covered 
over at the bottom, the opening and all, with a piece of 
clean flannel or of zinc gauze. Over this put a layer of 
coarse gravel about three inches deep, and over the gravel 
.1 layer of white sand of -^he same depth. Above the sand 
put four inches of charcoal, broken in fragments. If pos- 
sible use animal charcoal. Lay over the top a clean, fine 
sponge that covers it, or if you have not a sponge, a layer 
of clean flannel. The top layer, whether of flannel or 
sponge, is to o made sterile by frequent washing and 
boiling. Set the lilter in a wooden frame, and under it 
put a clean v ssel to receive the water as it comes through 
the filter.

DISEASE GERMS IN Dili > KINO WATER, AND HOW 
TO con DAT Til EM. 

T. Taking a little fikcrcd beef bouillon, clear as crystal 
to the eye, and iliowinjf uiulcr the nncroscopc not a trace o( 
life, let us place it in a glas^s flask and, boiling it repeatedly 
i(j destroy any germs it may contain, set it aside in a warm 
place Willi the mouth of the fkisk open. In a few days the 
liquid previously so limpid becomes very turbid. If we 
take a drop and magnify it 1,000 diameters we shall see that 
the liquid is crowded with life, and the few ounces of bouil- 
lon contain a vaster population than our greatest cities can 
boast of. 

2. Cohn has seen bacillus in infusions at blood heat 
aivide every twenty minutes. We have calculated this rate 
for twenty-tour hours, and have found that at the end of the 
first day there would be as the descendants of a single ba- 
cillus 4,7.22,366,482.869,645,213,696 individuals ; and though 
we can pack a trillion (1,000,000,000,000) in a cubic inch, 
this numoer would fill about 2,500,000 cubic feet. This is 
clearly not what they do, but simply what they are capable 
of doing for a short time when temperature and food supply 
are favorable. 

3. Since the multiplication of bacteria is so favored by 
the warmth of Summer, it requires special sanitary precau- 
tion, in order to keep free from disease. 

4. Vegetable Refuse or Slop,— If garbage and slops are 
thrown about the house, you can readily see what millions 
and myriads of l)acteria will form, and how the whole 
ground will soon swarm with them. They will more or less 
work their way among the things that must be eaten, or it 
a heavy rain should come, will easily find their way into 
the well and contaminate the water. Malaria, typhoid fever, 
etc., will soon be the result. 

5. Sink Uoles. — There should be a sink hole for gar- 
bage, slops and other refuse matter of the house, and this 
sinck hole should be sufficiently f^r from the well, so as not 
to contaminate the water. 

6. That sunshine is a germicide as well as a tonic has 
but recently been proved : if we take two flasks containing 
the bacillus with spores, and keep one in the direct sun- 
shine for a long time, while the other, exposed to the same 
heat, is kept from the sun, we find the sun-exposed spores 
have lost their virulence, while the others remain. Is there 
need to further press so patent a lesson ? As bacteria grow 
best in the r>resence of considerable moisture we lay ex>

i: such as to allow decomposing matter from the surface 
of the ground or any other place to soak into the well 
If this IS the case, it should be abandoned at once if 
you value life, for it is positively known that thousands 
have lost their hves by using such water. 

Every well should be laid up with brick or lime-stone 
and cemented about four feet from the surface. That 
will make a safe protection. 

Heavy rains will often cause water to flow into wells 
which has a very bad eiTect, and often develops disease 
germs. 

MALARIA AND WATER. 

The most recent scientific authorities are of the 
opinion that malaria is a water-born disease. In vast 
malarial districts, it is not the air which the inhabitants 
breathe, but the water they drink, which brings on the 
much-dreaded malarial fever. That this is the case in 
some sections of the land, has been clearly proved by the 
immunity from fever of such families as depended on fil- 
tered rain-water, and not on the wells of the country. 

It has also been noted that horses and other animals, 
brought into certain sections of the country, thrived well 
so long as they were housed and drank from the cistern 
supply of the barns, but sickened and died when left 
to wander iri the fields, and drink from brooks and pools. 
If this should be clearly proven, it might oe possible to 
starnp out one of the greatest evils of life in some sections 
of the country. 

It is not a difncu't matter to collect the rain-water in 
a clean cistern. It should be passed through a filtering 
medium that is frequently renewed, as it is now known that 
a filter too long in use becomes one of the most effective 
means of contaminating the water it is intended to purify. 
The filter that is clogged up with impurities is far worse 
than none at all, and this is the condition of a great 
many cistern filters. 

As an extra precaution, even the cistern-water ought to 
be boiled, poured in a clean earthen jar, and cooled in a 
pure atmosphere. The ire formed from contar.iinated 
water is almost as objectionable as the unclean water itself 
as a large number of bacteria are undisturbed by frost! 
Such a jai of boiled water should be daily renewed, as if it 
is left standing any length of time it will soon take on 
the same objectionable features as the water of th*- 
country.

in a very short time. 

CUTS AND WOUNDS. 

1. Clean the Wonnd.— In case of a wound first clean it 
and wash it thoroughly with warm water, and when the 
bleedin|r ceases, bring the edges together, either fastening 
them with a bandage or court plaster. 

2. Sewing a Wound. — If the 

wound is very wide a few stitches 
may be necessary. Take a needle 
and silk thread and oil both nee- 
dle and thread thoroughly with 
vaseline or pure lard. Each stitch 
should be tied into a knot, and 
should be left at least twenty-four 
hours before removing.

bandages. No time must be lost in the treat- 
ment of a case of this kind. 

4. Stabs. -- Stabs are more dangerous than 
common wounds, and the wound must be kept 
open and never be closed up until it heals 
naturally. All persons suffering from stabs 
should remam quietly in bed until all serious 
svmptoms have disappeared. 

5. Gun Shot Wounds.— All wounds of this 
character are serious and a physician should 
be promptly summoned. 

6. Sprains.— Sprains are the straining of the 
tendons and ligaments, and require great care 
and caution in their treatment. The injured 
member should be kept very quiet and band- 
aged with warm water. Then apply freelv 
Arnica, Pond's Extract or the like. ^

Poisoning. 



OTHER EEMEDIES FOR POISONING. 

In poisoning by opium strong coffee should be given 
the yictini being kept roused and awake, if possible, until 
medical aid be obtained. 

The antidotes to arsenic are tablespoonful doses of 
dialyzed iron, magnesia and castor oil. 

Carbolic acid: Give a tablespoonful of Epsom salts 
stirred in water, and repeat. 

.'\.mmonia: Oil of any kind. 

Oxalic acid: Give chalk, lime, lime-water or magnesia 
freely. 

Corrosive Sublimate: White of egg and milk in quan- 
tities. 

In poisoning by an acid the use of alkalis is indicated, 
as soda, magnesia, chalk, lime and soapsuds. When the 
mischief has been wrought by strong alkalis acid must be 
used, as vinegar, lemon juice or hard cider. 

When the mucous membrane of the mouth is much in- 
flamed or destroyed give raw eggs, flour stirred jn water 
flaxseed tea, arrowroot, or any soothing drink. Stimula- 
tion can be applied by means of hot water bottles or bags 
to the feet and over heart, and by rubbing the extremities. 
Alcoholic stimulant should be administered very cautiously 

tainting is caused by an interruption of the supply of 
blood to the brain. The head should be lowered immedi- 
ately. Often laying the person down will revive her ,with- 
out other measures. The head may be allowed to hang 
over the side of the couch for a few moments. Smelling- 
salts may be held to the nose and heat applied over the 
heart to stimulate its action. Open a window or outer 
door to admit plenty of fresh air, unfasten the clothing to 
permit free circulation. In severe cases when uncon- 
sciousness is prolonged, a mustard paste must be placed 
over the heart; if the breathing stops artificial respiration 
can be begun. It is useless to try to give stimulants by 
mouth unless the person is sufficiently conscious to be able 
to swallow. The attack usually passes off m a few min- 
utes, but the invalid should be made lo lie still and be kept 
«iuiet for some time after it. 

Convulsions in a grown person are always alarming. In 
children they proceed from a variety of causes, some of 
which are comparatively unimportant. A fit of indigestion 
or the irritation from cutting teeth may produce them 
They may indicate the commencement of di-^MSp ^uf th-^y 
are seldom fatai, and while the doctor should be sent for 
there is no cause for immediate alarm. 



Foreign Bodies in Ear, Nose, or Throat 



93 



FOREIGN BODIES IN EAR, NOSE OR THROAT. 

There are few accidents more alarming to a mother than 
when a child swallows a foreign body. 

If it has gone beyond reach of the finger no special 
efifort should be made to dislodge it. Nature will prob- 
ably take care of it if she is not interfered with. Emetics 
or cathartics may produce disastrous results. '.The only 
thing that can be done is to give a plentiful meal of soft 
food. 

Foreign Bodies in the Ear.— Th-jse do not usually occa- 
sion much discomfort for a time, and as the passage of the 
outer ear is closed at the end by a membrane they cannot 
penetrate farther, and may safely be left until they can be 
removed by a competent person. When an insect has 
entered turn the head c.i one side with the affected ear 
uppermost and gently pour in a little warm water. When 
this runs out the drowned intruder comes with it. 

Water should not be used when a pea or bean has been 
introduced, because they swell when moist. 

Foreign Bodies in tlie Nose.— These may sometimes be 
drawn out with a bent hairpin. If not easily removed in 
this way they should not be poked at. A little snuff or 
pepper may be sniffed in, or the opposite nostril tickled 
with a straw. The act of sneezing will probably dislodge 
the substance; if not it should be left for a surgeon to ex- 
tract. 

Foreign Bodies in tlie Tliroat.— This may be a very 

serious accident whether it occurs in the windpipe or th^ 
food passage. It demands immediate action or the result 
may be a fatal one. Send for the doctor at once, as he 
may have to open the windpipe to save the victim's life 
Meauume slap the sufferer on the back between the shoul- 
ders. Insert the finger as far down as possible to try to 
grasp the obstruction and remove it. Turn the person's 
head downward and slap the back forcibly. 

If breathing ceases the patient should be laid on the 
back, the arms pulled upward, the hands resting on the top 
ot the head, then brought down and pressed on the chest 
repeating the movements sixteen times in a minute. 

Strangulation.— When a person is strangling, make him 
swallow the white of an ^^^, but do not beat it. Tliis will 
almost certainly dislodge the obstruction, unle?s lodged in

with a spoon handle so as to be able to look down the throut 
ancl with a pair of tweezers remove the bone. If this can- 
not be done, swallow the whiles of several eg-gs (one at a 
tune), or take a big bite of bread and swallow it; if this 
tails, send for a good surgeon at once. 








5. Snnstroke.— Remove the patient in the shade, and 
apply cold water to the head and neck, and a mustard 
plaster to the feet. Administer strong stimulants. 

6. Coal Gas Suflfocation.— If the patient does not breathe, 
produce artificial respiration; place the patient on his face 
and turn the body gently, but completely, one side and a 
mtle beyond; then again on the face and so on alternately. 
Kepeat these movements deliberately and perseverinelv. 
fafteen times only in a minute. ^ 

BURNS. 

There is no accident more terrible than severe injuries 
from fire. All well-instructed persons know that when a 
>yoman s dress is in flames water i« almost useless to ex- 
tinguish It unless she could be plunged under it. The fire 
can be put out only by cutting off the supply of air, with- 
out which It cannot burn. This can be done by enveloping 
the person in a rug, blanket or any woolen article of suf- 
ncient size. 

Baking Soda.— The pain from slight burns is very great. 



Bums. 



95 



An excellent application is a thick paste of common bak- 
mg soda moistened with water, spread on a piece of linen 
or cotton, and bound on the part. This can be kept wet 
by squeezing water on it from a sponge or cloth until the 
smarting is soothed. 

Starch.— A thick coating of starch can be used instead 
of the soda, or wheat-flour if nothing better can be had 
but neither should be applied if the skin is broken. Iii 
this case it is better to use vaseline, olive or linseed oil 
or equal parts of raw linseed oil and lime water. The doc- 
tor will apply some preparation containing carbolic acid. 

If the air can be effectually excluded from a burn the 
pain is relieved. 

Blisters should be pricked and the fluid absorbed with a 
soft cloth before applying a dressing. 

If the cloth adheres to the skin the loose part should be 
cut away and the patches of material soaked off with oil or 
warm water. 

When the injury is extensive the sufferer will be pros- 
trated and may die from the shock. Heat should be ap- 
plied to the extremeties and over the heart, and hot drinks 
given until the doctor comes. 

Burns From Acid.— In burns from a strong acid the part 
n ^- -M <^°ve'"ed with dry baking soda or lime, as the 
alkah will neutralize the acid. No water should be used 
but a dressing of cosmoline or oil applied after the alkali 
has been brushed off. 

When the burn has been caused by an alkali an acid 
must be used. A person recovering from the effects of a 
burn requires very nourishing food. 

White of Eggs.— A soothing application for burns is 
to cover them with the white of an egg. This forms a 
coating over the injured flesh and protects it from the air. 

Aiiotlier Remedy — Some think there is nothing that 
can equal lime and lard. Take sifted air-slacked lime and 
mix with lard. Spread on a cloth. If the burn is deep, 
another plaster should be made at once to lay on As 
soon as the lard gets warm it will begin to burn again, 
bcrape the plaster on and mix in more fresh lime After 
the wound quits burning the plasters should be kept on 
and will heal the sore. Air-slacked lime is valuable and 
should be kept in the house at all times, as it affords in- 
stant relief for burns. 

Magic Cure.— Loose cotton, slightly moistened with lin- 
seed oil, has almost a magical effect in relievine the oaim.

Broken Bones. 



BROKEN BONES. 

A Broken Bone need not be set immediately. This 
knowledge saves much unnecessary anxiety when the doc- 
tor cannot be procured at once. 

The parts must be put in as comfortable position as pos- 
sible and most nearly corre poiuiing to the natural one. It 
is necessary to give suppoi above and below the break. 

Handle the injured part very carefully, not to force the 
rough ends of bone through the skin. 

Improvise splints of some kind — two strips of wood, a 
couple of stout book covers, or pieces of pasteboard. 
Place on one side when it is a limb that is injured, and 
bind them in place with handkerchiefs. A long pillow 
firmly tica will answer the purpose, or in case of injury to 
a leg it may be fastened to its fellow if nothing better can 
be done, remembering to tie it above and below the 
injury. 

8hoaldcr-Bone. — VVli a the shoulder-bone is broken 
place the arm on th •. rjiired side across the chest, the 
hand touching the or i*' !;■?£* shoulder, and fasten it in place 
by passing a broad '/fu! --.;<; around the body. 

Fracture of the Riws. In fracture of the ribs pin a towel 
around the body until the doctor comes. 

In a simple fracture the bone is broken, it may be. in 
several places, but there is no deep flesh wound extending 
to the seat of the injury; when there is such a wound the 
fracture is said to be compound. 

When there is a fracture the part is unnaturally movable 
unless the ends of the bone have been driven together or 
impacted. 

Dislocation.— In a dislocation the bone is forced out of 
its socket at the joint. There is more or less deformity, 
and it is difficult to move the limb. The last point helps 
to distinguish it from the fracture. Time is of importance, 
as the swelling which supervenes increases the difficulty 
of reducing it or returning the bone to its proper place. 
Hot applications may be made if the surgeon cannot be 
had immediately. 

FOR BAKB WIRE CUTS. 

Take carbolic acid i ounce, water i pint; mix. Apply 
this to the cut three or four times a day until the cavity 
gets nearly full with new flesh, and then apply mutton 
tallow.

Benefit of Poultices. 



4. To get rid of this gas from the bottom of the well, it 
can be dipped out with buckets, the same as water, because 
it is heavier than air. 

5. Another method is to take a bundle of straw or shav- 
ings, and set^ it on fire.This heats tlie gas and makes it 
lighter than air, and it will rise and escape. 

6. Another method. Throw slaked lime mixed tvitli 
water down the sides of the well. This will at once absorb 
the gas. 

THE BENEFIT OF POULTICES. 

The chief object of a poultice is to supply and to retain 
heat and moisture for the relief of pain and internal con- 
gestion. The best poultice is made of ground flax seed, 
but bread, cornmeai or hominy may be substituted. 

The greatest benefit of a poultice comes from its heat; 
therefore great care should be taken to apply it very hot. 

In order to render a poultice more effective in re- 
lieving and diminishing deep-seated pain, as in the chest 
or abdomen, mustard may be added to the flax seed. This 
does not produce any unpleasant irritation of the skin, and 
is far better for ordinary purposes than a mustard plaster. 
In this case the mustard shoi Id be carefully mixed with a 
little warm water and then stirred into the flax seed just 
before it is spread upon the cloth. The amount of mustard 
depends upon the intensity of the pain and the age of the 
person. Poultices after being applied to the body should 
be covered with either oiled silk or flannel, so that the heat 
may be retained. A fresh hot poultice should be applied 
as soon as the first one cools. 

Poultices should never be made unnecessarily thick or 
heavy, and they should be frequently repeated. They 
ought always to be put on warm, and as moist as they can 
be made, without being so soft as to flow when placed 
upon the skin. When they become dry and the tempera- 
ture falls, they can do little if any good, and may possibly 
do more injury than service. 

The common poultices are useful in all cases of inflam- 
mation that cannot be cut short, to assist the process of 
suppuration and the tendency of matter to the surface. 
_ A list-of these poultices, and their methods of prepara- 
tion, should be found in the medicine closet of every 
home, where, in cases of emergency, they may be ready 
for hurried reference, when their soothing effects are most 
needed.

ttow to Make Bandages for Wounds uHa Som, 




How to Make All Kinds of Bandages 

FOR WOUNDS AND SORES. 

I. Every wound or bruise should be well bandaged with 
soft, hnen rags, and protected from the air. 
t _ 2. Care should be used not to draw the bandages too 
tightly, as It will cause much suffering. "*""«i&es loo 

3. If a limb is bleed- 
ing badly, wrap a hand- 
kerchief around it above 
the wound. Tie a small 
stick into it, and twist it 
until the blood stops flow- 
ing. — Serious bleeding 
always results frem the 
cutting of an artery, and 
demands immediate at- 
tention. 

4. An artery can always 
be known by its beating, 
or by the blood escaping 
in jets, and if severed in 
any other parts of the 
body except the Jimbs, 

the flow of blood must be 

stopped by placing the hand upon the wound and holding 
the parts together until a physician can be summoned. 

5- Sores and ulcers should be cleansed and dried every 
day. and new and dean bandages applied. No wound or 
»rc will heal rapidly unless kept perlfectly clean.

A Cure for Boils, Etc. 
A CURE FOR BOILS. 



1. Take a good tonic of some kind, to stimulate the 
system and cleanse the blood. Some preparation of sarsa- 
parilla is a very good remedy. 

2. A good tonic will prevent other boils from coming. 

3. Eat nourishing food, such as eggs, beefsteak, mutton, 
poultry, etc. 

4. Apply bread and milk or flaxseed poultices, until 
ready to open, or use the skin of a boiled egg wet. 

5. After opening the boil thoroughly, and squeezing out 
all the pus, apply a v/arm poultice for a day, and then wash 
with castile soap or boracic acid, and dress it with soft 
linen until well. 




A SPBAINBD HAND^ 



HOW TO CURB BRUISES AND SPRAINS. 

For bruises and sprains there is nothing better than hot 
water, applied as vrarm as can be endured without too 
much pain. Apply the waiter with several thicknesses of 
flannel, and change it as soon as it gets cool. Applying 
cold water to bruises and sprains is an injury instead of a 
benefi't. It should never be done. After a day or two any 
kind of liniment may be applied. Gentle rubbing after a 
few days will aid materially. 

"ONLY A SPRAIN.»» 

The reason why a sprain is often not more speedily 
cu^d IS that It is considered "only a sprain," and not 
sufficient attention is paid to the injury at the time. A 
sprain may become a very serious matter if not proper^ 
treated, but with proper, immediate and thorough tsfot- 
ment a cure will soon be effected. 



Felon. 



105 



The first thing to be done is to immerse the part in hot 
water. The water should be as hot as can be borne, and 
should be kept up to a constant temperature by frequent 
additions. It will be necessary to continue this treatment 
for a long time, it may be for hours, or until every trace of 
soreness is practically dispelled. 

The part is then to be tightly strapped in a bandage in a 
position just short of absolute fixity. The best article to 
use in such a case is what is called in medical parlance a 
"Martin's bandage." This is a long, narrow strip of sheet 
rubber, of sufficient strength to withstand considerable 
strain and fitted at one end with tapes for tying. It is 
easily seen that by the use of this bandage the desired 
pressure can be obtained without complete immovability. 

Another Remedy for Sprains.— Wormwood boiled in 
vinegar and applied hot as can be borne on a sprain or 
bruise is an invaluable remedy. The affected member 
should afterward be rolled in flannel to retain the heat. 



LEMON FOR FELON. 



When it is suspected that a 
finger, procure a lemon and cut o 
with a pair of pointed scissors 
cut out the hard core in center of 
seed that may be in the way, an 
lemon and let it remain there

Experience With a Pnnctnred Wonnd.— Last summer 
I had a painful experience, which threatened serious re- 
sults, from a punctured wound received on the bottom of 
my foot by stepping on one of those little brass staples 
which are used in a piece of cardboard to fasten the prices 
on goods. It had fallen on the floor at night, while putting 
away some of the day's purchases, and was unobserved 
until I stepped on it. The points pierced about half an 
inch into the ball of the foot. An abscess threatened to 
form at the bottom of the wound. After trying various 
remedies to no avail, I thought of lemons, and bound the 
pulp over the inflamed wound. The remedy proved ef- 
fectual and the dreaded abscess was prevented from form- 
ing.

HOW TO CURE FELONS. 

Symptoms.— Throbbing pain, which is often felt up the 
arm; tender to the touch; hand of a dusky red color. 

Home Treatment,— Apply poultices wet with laudanum 
or wash in a solution of carbolic acid to soften the parts- 
wipe dry and apply a coat of collodion and give the 
patient a good dose of physic. 

General Treatment — If the above treatment is not 
suthcient, go to a physician and have it lanced so as to 
lay open the flesh to the bone. 

CARBUNCLES. 

Carbuncles are nothing more or less than large boils 
accompanied with more or less pain and constitutional 
disturbances. 

Home Treatment.— First look after the general health

HOME REMEDIES AND HOW TO USE THEM. 

A Green Herb is Worth More than a Latin Thrase. 

People have too long been educated to look upon a med- 
ical monopoly as the safest means of ensuring their health; 
they swallow nauseous drugs, but turn with indifference 
from vegetables as a medicine, while they eat them with 
complacency at their dinner; that which is thought excel- 
lent to sustain them in health loses its power when they 
are prostrated by disease. 

Herbs and vegetable substances have this superiority 
over mineral medicines, in that they are a food as well as 
a medicine. Those who use herbs as a medicine will find 
the sicTc able to subsist upon these medicines, when the 
lightest of food is rejected, thus giving nature time to 
rally her forces. It is too often the case th*. i patient 
reads a pompous recommendation of a medicii e of which 
he has no knowledge, and swallows it with avidity, in the 
hope of obtaining relief, when, if he knew its component 
parts, he would fly from it as from the fangs of a rattle- 
snake. 

The intelligent reader is here taught how to remove dis- 
eases in the quickest and safest manner, and if he closely 
follows the suggestions made in the following pages he 
will be as well fitted to cope with diseases a» many who 
have passed through the curriculum of the schools. 

Dr. Robinson says, that "amidst all the different 
branches of knowledge which have engaged the attention 
of mankind there can be none of equal importance (re- 
ligion only excepted) to the treatment or cure of the 
disease to which the human family is subject; for," 
says he, "the sou! in a diseased body is like the martyr 
in his dungeon; it may retain its value, but it has lost its 
usefulness."

The Wonderful Curative rrojiertles of Common Salt. 

1. Common salt possesses j?rcat curative properties 
and It IS an excellent household remedy, and always at 
hand. 

2. Heated dry and applied to outer surface, over the 
seat of inflammation or congestion, it will Rive almost 
instant relief. 

3. Applications of hot solutions of salt and water or 
vincRar will act like magic upon toothache, neuralgic 
headache, and other similar diseases. 

4. For catarrh and sore throat a spray of warm water 
and salt, applied often, will cure almost every case, i' 
taken in time. For hay fever and those other slight forms 
of nasal diseases which produce constant sneezing, there 
is no remedy more quickly effective, and often curative 
than the vapor of heated salt and alcohol. (Heat it very 
hot, and breathe the vapor for ten minutes at a time, four 
or five times a day.) 

5. For sensitive and bleeding gums, apply salt and cold 
water once or twice a day. A sure cure. 

6. Slight bleeding can be easily checked by the use of 
salt and water. 

7. Tender feet may be cured in a very short time by 
daily brisk rubbing with cold water and salt. 

8. A pinch of salt in hot water, taken either just before 
or just after eating, greatly aids digestion, and has cured 
many cases of dyspepsia. 

9. A cup of hot water and salt will sometimes quiet 
the severest vomiting when nothing else will. 

10. Caution.— Salt eaten with the food in too great 
quantities is very injurious. Too much salt dries up the 
blood, and gives the skin a yellow pallor.

11. Neuralgia of the feet and limbs can be cured by bath- 
ing iiiglit aiul nioniiiig with salt water a . hot as can be 
borne; when taken out, rub the feet with a coarse towel. 

12. Severe pains in the bowels and stomach are often 
speedily iclicved by the application of a bag of hot salt. 

13. A weak solution of salt and water is recommended 
by good physicians as a remedy for imi)crfect digestion, 
and for a ccid in the head it is a complete cure snutTed up 
from the hollow of the hand. We have known severe 
chronic cases of catarrh entirely cured by persistent use of 
this simple remedy every night and morning for severa' 
months, when the best efforts of the best physicians failed 
to do any good. It should be used milk warm. 

14. A good handful of rock salt added to the bath is the 
next best thing after an "ocean dip," and a gargle of a 
weak solution is a good and ever-ready rtmedy for a sore 
throat. 

15. One of the most effective remedies known for the 
sick headache is to place a pinch of salt on the tongue and 
allow it to dissolve slowly. In about ten minutes it may 
be followed by a drink of water. 

16. There is nothing better for the relief of tired or 
weak eyes than to bathe them with a strong solution of 
salt and water, applied as hot as it can be borne. 

17. Salt is most excellent for cleansing the teeth. It 
hardens the gums and sweetens the breath 

THE USEFUL ONION. 

The medicinal qualities of the onion are not to be de- 
spised. An onion will cure the earache quicker than any 
other remedy. Take two or three good-sized onions. 
Peel them and cut fn thin slices. Lay the slices on a cloth 
and heat until hot. Bind this to the head, letting it ex- 
tend beyond the ear at least one inch all the way round. 
An onion poultice is most useful in cases of internal in- 
flammation, and onions arc an excellent remedy for 
diphtheria and pneumonia. When the digestive system is 
apt to become overloaded with rich, greasy or sweet foods, 
plenty of onions should be eaten as a counterbalance. 
They are good for the stomach, the complexion, and the 
nerves when eaten either boil d or raw, but of course the 
unpleasant odor left on the breath after indulgence in them 
is a barrier to their use to many people who would other- 
wise be able \o take advantage of the good there is in 
them. To overcome all this, and give every one a chance, 
an old remedy is suggested — parsley. To entirely destroy 
the bad odor of onions eat a small sprig of this pretty

freen herb either with your meals or immediately after 
them. There will be nothing in the breath or about the 
person at all suggestive of the odoriferous bulb five min- 
utes after the parsley is eaten. 

WOOD SAGE. 

It is an excellent bitter, and removes obstructions from 
the kidneys and liver; as a diuretic, it acts freely upon the 
bladder; it likewise cleanses old sores; if taken in a green 
state and mixed with linseed, or oatmeal, it makes a good 
poultice, and may be applied to old sores, or inflammations 
with good effect. 

TANSY. 

A tea of this herb will relieve gravel, strangury, weak- 
ness and phin in the back and kidneys; it is also good for 
female weakness. The leaves when bruised are used for 
soothing contusions, etc. 

PARSLEY. 

The seed, herb and root are all possessed of strong 
diuretic properties, and have an aromatic taste. This plant 
is povyerfully diuretic, and gently aperient; it is useful in 
dropsical cases, or in affections of the kidneys. 
SLIPPERY ELM. 

The inner bark of this tree is a valuable demulcent, pos- 
sessing very soothing qualities, and is particularly applica- 
ble, both as a medicine and injection, in cases of dysentery 
and other diseases of the bowels. A teaspoonful of the 
powder mixed in half a pint of hot water, and sweetened, 
forms an excellent drink in irritation of the mucous 
membrane of the stomach and bowels. It may be used as 
a poultice in nil cases of local inflammation with great 
benefit. 

RED CLOYER. 

The flowers of the common clover, such as is cut for 
hay, are a vakiablc article; a salve made of them is 
good for cancer, old sores and sore lips; it is soft and ad- 
hesive, and the flowers contain so great a quantity of 
honey that it enhances the medicinal properties of the 
salve. To make this salve take a large brass or tin kettle, 
or boiler, fill it with clover heads or flowers, coyer them 
witk water, let them boil briskly for an hour, then strain 
and press the flowers well, and then re-fill the same vessel 
with flowers, putting them in the same liquor; strain again, 
and simmer down, until it is of the consistency of thick tar.

lively action in the system; for old sores of every descrip- 
tion this salve is equally good. In making it, great care 
should be taken not to burn it, or its virtue will be much 
impaired. 

Clover tea purifies the blood, clears the complexion and 
removes pimples; dried clover may be used for tea. 
GUM ARABIC. 

This gum will not mix with spirits, but it readily dis- 
solves in twice its quantity of water; when in this fluid 
state it becomes an excellent mucilaginous medicine, useful 
for coughs, or hoarseness; or also acts as a diuretic. 

HOREHOUND. 

As a tonic, it possesses great power; it likewise stimu- 
lates by acting as an expectorant, having a tendency to 
loosen the phlegm. Take a strong decoction of this valua- 
ble herb on going to bed, the first time you have the mis- 
fortune to take cold, and add to each dose half a teaspoon- 
ful of cayenne pepper, with a tablespoonful of good vine- 
gar. A syrup made of horehound and ginger-root is 
excellent for children when attacked with the whooping 
cough, or for sudden colds; or it may be pulverized and 
mixed with half its quantity of ginger, a teaspoonful of 
cayenne, and one of cloves; this, when well sweetened and 
taken hot on going to bed, will be found to be one of the 
best medicines that can be obtained. 

AMERICAN GOLDEN ROD. 

Sweet-scented golden rod. This herb may be used for 
the headache, as also to produce perspiration; it possesses 
stimulating and nervine properties, and may be given in 
the form of tea, in lieu of any of the mints; its taste is 
sweet and spicy, and on the whole agreeable. 

BORAX. 

1. Borax is, in the first place, one of the most power- 
ful, if not indeed the most powerful, antiseptic known. 

2. It is priceless for its convenience on the toilet table ; 
used to wash the head, as much as one can hold in the 
hollow of the hand to about a quart of water— it destroys 
dandruff. 

3. It allays the heat of sunburn, bleaches out tan and 
redness, helps freckles and moth to a great degree, in 
a weak solution relieves inflammation of the eyes, as after 
crjing and in rheumatic affections. •* 

4. It is an invaluable ingredient in almost every denti- 
frice, and cure for canker in the mouth, and for any 

gumboil.

lieve distress in the stomach, sudden 
diarrha'a, etc. An even teaspoonful 
.sliould be stirred into a wineglassful of 
water and taken in one dose; children 
according to age. 

2. If children are wakeful, restless and 
cross, throwing up curdled milk from 
the stomach, nothing is better 
than a little soda and cold water. 
Soda will often relieve rheuma- 
tism, and soda-baths are very efFi 
cacious in curing various skin 
diseases.

SAGE. 

This is an excellent remedy for wind, colds, or night 
sweats. 

Dose. Make the same into a strong tea and drink a 
teacupful several times a day, or as emergency may de- 
mand. 

SALTPETRE (NITRATE OF POTASH). 

An excellent domestic remedy for inflammatory rheu- 
matism, sore throat, asthma, dysentery, gravel, and skin 
diseases. 

Dose. Of a tablespoonful of powdered saltpetre stirred 
in a pint of cold water, take two or three tablespoonfuls 
every two hours. For gravel boil the same quantity in 
new milk and give three or four tablespoonfuls of the 
liquid to a dose. For sore throat it is used as a gargle. 
For asthma soak paper in a strong liquid of saltpetre 
water, then dry. Burn the paper and inhale the smoke 
and it will give speedy relief. For dysentery take a tea- 
spoonful of powdered saltpetre and stir into a tumbler 
of water. Take a teaspoonful of this every hour. 

RED PEPPER. 

A teaspoonful of red pepper mixed with molasses and 
taken in one dose, is considered one of the best remedies 
for delirium tremens and sea-sickness.

HOME REMEDIES AND HOME TREATMENT FOR 
ALL DISEASES. 

In the following pages we give the symptoms, causes 
and treatments of diseases from which mankind suffers. 

We are free to say that in all cases we prefer the Home 
Treatment to any other, as under proper care it is the 
most simple, reliable, efficacious, and at the same time 
the most economical- method, and never leaves any evil 
after effects. 

For the benefit of those who prefer Homeopathic or the 
Regular Treatment, including drugs, we have in most 
cases given these treatments al?o. 



COLIC IN AD UL TS. 

Symptoms.— Colic is a griping pain in the bowels, chiefly 
about the navel, relieved by pressure, and often accompanied 
with a painful distension of tlie whole of the lower region of 
the bowels, with vomiting, costiveness, and spasmodic contrac. 
tioa of the muscles of the abdomen. 

Causes.— The complaint is produced by various causes, such 
as indigestible fruits, long continued costiveness, cold, or it 
may be due, as in painter's colic, to poi? ^ning by lead. 

Home Treatment.— Hot fomentat iS applied to the abdo- 
men to relieve the pain, and a strong physic. One of the best 
is blue mass in 5 or 10 grains. Tepid water injection in the 
bowels, a few drops of peppermint in hot water, or strong cat- 
nip tea, will often J;ive speedy relief. Keep the feet dry and 
avoid food, that disagrees with the patient. 

Homeopathic Treatment. — Colocynth when cramps In 
region of the navel with diarrhoea. Nux vomica when from 
constipation and indigestible food. Cliamomilla when ia 
children. IpeiJac, if vomiting is an accompanying symptom. 

Regular Treatment. — If caused by some indigestible 
article of food, a dose of castor oil had better be given, say a 
tablespoonful for an adult, to which from ten to fifteen drops 
of laudanum may be added. If the pain is very severe a tur- 
pentine stupe may be applied over the abdomen. The follow- 
ing mixture will be found very useful in such cases: Solutios 



126 



llomc Remedies and Home Treatment. 



of the muriate of morphia, 2 drachms; spirit of chloroform, 
1/2 ounce; water to make 2 ounces. A teaspoonful to be 
given every two hours until the pain is relieved. 

CRAMPS AND CRAMP COLIC. 

Homo Treatment. — For cramp colic give a wineglass- 
ful of olive oil. For cramps, rubbing the parts thoroughly 
with the hands or a piece of flannel will generally produce 
relief. The application of turpentine or spirits of harts- 
horn, rubbed on with the hand, is highly recommended. 

COLIC IN CHILDREN. 

A good remedy is nothing more nor less than glycerin, 
as much as the child will take. It is best to begin with 
a teaspoonful, but there is no fear of giving too much. 
The first effect is the quieting of the cry of pain; the 
second, the belching of the gas; later the gas passes away 
downward, and finally, after an easy movement of the 
bowels, the child falls into a sweet, restful sleep. Try it, 
its efficacy will surprise you, as will also the readiness with 
which the little one will suck it from the spoon. 

CRAMPS IN THE LEGS. 

Many persons of either sex are troubled with cramp in 
one or both of the legs. It usually comes on during night 
and while it lasts the pain is acute. Most people jump 
out of bed — the cramp nearly always comes on just after 
going to bed or while undressing — and either rub their 
legs or get some one to do it for them. There is some- 
thing easier than' to overcome the spasm, and the method 
suggested is as follows: Provide a good strong cord — 
a garter will do if nothing else is handy. When the cramp 
comes on, take the cord, wind it around the leg over the 
place in which the pain is felt and take one end in each 
hand, and give it a sharp pull, one that will hurt a little. 
The cramp will cease instantly, and the sufferer can go 
to bed assured that it will not come again that night. 

HOW TO CURE NIGHTMARE. 

Cause. — Nightmares are probably the result of indiges- 
tion, late suppers, too much excitement or hard thinking, 
cold feet, costivencss, flatulence, etc. 

Home Treattmen. — Avoid the causes and eat light sup- 
pers. Sleep with another person. A little cayenne pepper 
or baking soda, taken just before retiring, will be found 
efficacious. 



Sleeplessness. 



127 




HEALTHY POSITION FOR THE HEAD AND BACK. 

HOME REMEDIES FOR SLEEPLESSNESS. 

Mait; suffer from nervousness and want of sleep. Many 
remedies have been given, but few have proven success- 
uu. The following are some of the best household reme- 
dies known. 

1. A bath, taken just before retiring, is highly recom- 
mended. If this is not satisfactory wash the face, neck 
and hands in cold water, and then retire and keep the 
mind quiet. 

2. If the trouble is a want of sleep after the first nap 
get up and walk around the room two or three times. 
With some this is a sure remedy. 

3- Lie with the head to the North, for there is no doubt 
something in the electrical effects of the earth upon the 
body when in that position. 

4. Bad sleepers should always rise early and retire 
early, and they should never take a nap during the day. 

5. Sleepless persons should avoid exciting conversation 
or reading, hard study, or any kind of mental excitement 
during the evening. 

6. Tea and coffee should never be drank for supper. 

7. When lying in bed, first draw in the breath slowly 
letting ,t out suddenly, then draw it in suddenly and let 
It pass slowly out a number of times alternately. This is 
highly recommended. 

8. A cup of hot water taken just before retiring will 
otten produce the desired results. 




128 



How to Sleep. 




UNHEILTHT POSITION FOB THE HEAD AND BAGS. 



Many diseases have their beeianing in sleeping un high pillows. 

9. Nervous and sleepless persons are often benefited by 
sleeping on a pillow of hops. 

10. In case of nervous irritability a warm foot-bath 
will often produce sleep. 

11. If the above home treatments are not sufficient, take 
from 5 to 10 grains of bromide of potassium just before 
retiring. 

12. A brisk walk in the open air just before retiiing 
will often effect a perfect cure. 




HOW TO CHECK VOMITING. 

Home Treatment. — A teaspoonful or two of hot water 

sometimes acts like a charm; a pinch of salt will often 
relieve vomiting; ice dissolved in the mouth, will often 
accomplish what other medicines will not; a mustard paste 
over the stomach is highly recommended. Much, how- 
ever, depends upon the diet. If the stomach is in a rest- 
less condition, only the lightest kind of food should be 
taken, and it can be easily determined in a few days what 
food the stomach will or will not retain. Perfect rest 
is generally more necessary than food or medicine. For 
chronic vomiting lime water is one of the best remedies. 

General Treatment. — Subnitrate of bismuth in 2 to 6 
grain doses, or oxalate of cerium in i-grain doses, or 
one drop of the tincture of ipecac, taken in a wineglassful 
of water. 

Homeopathic BemeJies.— Nux vomica and arsenicum. 



Neuralgia. 
NEURALGIA. 



129 



Cause.— The cause is obscure in many cases. It may re- 
sult from an impoverished condition of the blood It 
may be caused by violent passions, strong emotions ex- 
cessive exercise, mental depression, malaria, or lead pois- 
oning. 

Symptoms.— Sudden, sharp and darting pains feeline 
like hot wires piercing the parts. The parts more com- 
monly affected are the face, the muscles between the ribs 
and the hip and leg. When it is in the hip and leg it is 
generally called sciatica. It sometimes attacks the heart 

Home Treatment.— Bathe the affected parts in salt water 
Use nourishing diet. Neuralgia in the face is often re-' 
heved by taking a good active cathartic. An external 
application of peppermint is highly recommended. Eat 
plenty of fat meat, nnd avoid lea, but drink plenty of milk 
Avoid exposure to dampness. For sciatica wear chamois 
leather drawers. 

Oeneral Treatment.— Fifteen grains of carbonate of iron 
three times a day, taken in a little syrup. This treatment for 
a month cr more will have beneficial effects. A seidlitz 
powder taken every morning, or a small quantity of cream 
of tartar or citrate of magnesia, will produce excellent re- 
sults. Three grains of quinine three times a day may pro- 
duce the desired results. For neuralgic headache take 15 
grains- bromide of potash three times a day. 




REMEDY FOR NEURALGIA. 

Hypophosphite of soda, taken in i drachm doses three 
times per day in beef tea, is a good remedy for this pain- 
ful affection. So is the application of bruised horse-radish, 
or the application of oil of" peppermint applied lightly with 
a camel-hair pencil, 






130 



Neuralgia, 



Sure Cnre* — The most stubborn cases of ncuralj^ia are 
apt to yield to a hot water treatment. Wherever the pain 
is located, there a hot water bag should be applied. The 
suffering part should be wrapped in a blanket, and the 
unfortunate patient shouid be put to bed and covered witli 
more blankets and induced to drink at least three cups ot 
water as hot as the palate can stand. This treatment may 
«eem severe, but it is sure to bring relief. 

A Hot Bath, a stroll in the fresh air, shampooing the 
head in weak soda-water, or a timely nap in a cool, quiet 
room will sometimes stop a nervous headache. When 
overfatigued from shopping or sightseeing a sponge dipped 
in very hot water and pressed repeatedly over the back 
of the neck between the ears will be found exceedingly re- 
freshing, especially if the face and temples are afterward 
subjected to the same treatment. Neuralgia is caused not 
only by cold air, but by acidity of the stomach, starved 
nerves, imperfect teeth, or by indolence combined with a 
too generous diet. 

Heat is the best and quickest cure for this distressini^ 
pain. A hot flat-iron, passed rapidly and deftly over sev- 
eral folds of flannel laid on the affected spot, will often give 
relief in less than ten minutes, without the aid of medicine. 
Hot fomentations are of equal value; though when the 
skin is very tender it is more advisable to use dry heat, 
nothing being better for the purpose than bags of heated 
salt, flour or sand, which retain warmth for a long time. 

Cold Water, applied by the finger tips to the nerves 
in front of the ear, has been known to dispel neuralgic 
pains like magic. 

Cbarcoal. — When caused by acidity a dose of charcoal 
or soda will usually act as a corrective. Sick headache 
is accompanied by bilious symptoms, and attacks usually 
come on when the person is overtired or below par 
physically. This is a disease of the first half of life, and 
often stops of its own accord after middle age. A care- 
ful diet is imperative in every case, sweetmeats and pastry 
being especially pernicious. 

Reflei: Action. — Eating heartily when very tired, late 
dinners, eating irregularly, insufficient mastication or too 
much animal food, especially in the spring or during hot 
weather, are frequent causes of indigestion, causing head- 
aches by reflex action, 



Headaches. 



HEADACHES. 



131 



'■? j' 



In considering the subject of headache we should never 
lose sight of the fact that we are studying merely a symp- 
tum and not a disease. Pain, and especially the pain 
under consiaeration, is a danger signal set by nature to 
warn the sufferer that a deep-seated malady threatens the 
body. A celebrated physician once called pain "the prayer 
of a nerve for healthy blood." No truer saying was ever 
uttered. 

Digestion.— By far the most common form of headache 
is that due to a disordered condition of the organs of 
digestion. Such headaches are the results of indigestion 
and constipation, as well as of over-indulgence in eating or 
drinking. A disordered stomach or a sluggish condition 
of the bowels, combined with overwork and too little 
exercise in the open air, are frequent causes of headache 
in persons who pursue sedentary and indoor occupations. 

Ilemedy.— The remedy for this kind of headache is the 
exercise of regularity and moderation in eating, with an 
avoidance of food which is innutritions and difficult of 
digestion, and attention to the regularity of the bowels. 
The last point is of especial importance. 

Eyo Strain.— One variety of head-iche, the cause of 
which is sometimes overlooked, results from eye-strain. 
The provision of proper glasses, and treatment calculated 
to improve the tone of the muscles of the eyes, have been 
followed by prompt relief in numberless instances. 

Sick Headaclic— The following cure for sick headache 
I have used with perfect success, and it is much to be pre- 
ferred to powerful- drugs, which injure the system, and 
if taken repeat.^dly are soon found to lose their efficacy. 
At the same time it is well to remember that pain is 
nature's danger signal, and a warning to rest. After driv- 
ing off a headache, lie down for an hour or two, and keep 
as quiet as possible during the rest of the day. Neither 
the brain nor the stomach should be taxed for twenty- 
four hours. 

Cayenne Pepper.— Mix a tablespoonful of cayenne pep- 
per to a thick paste with vinegar, spread it on a strip of 
thin cloth, which may be folded together, and bind on the 
forehead from temple to temple. Then swallow a "pinch" 
of the pepper— say a quarter of a teaspoonful— in a tea- 
spoonful of vinegar or lemon juice. The plaster will

burn, but not blister, and in the course of ten minutes the 
headache will disappear under the stimulating effect of 
this treatment. 

Hot Water. — Sick headache can usually be cured bv 
soaking the feet and the hands above the wrists in water 
hot as can be borne; it may have a little salt or mustard in 
it, to keep from taking cold after it. Sip slowly boiling 
hot water, and go to bed in a darkened room. Eat 
nothing until you feel a need or desire for food, then take 
a little milk or a cracker, or some other very simple food. 

Walkingr Backward.— The Medical Record is authority 
for the statement that nervous headache may be cured by 
the simple act of walking backward ton minutes. "It is 
well," says the writer; "to get in a long, narrow room 
where the windows are high, and walk very slowly, placing 
first the ball of the foot on the floor, and then the heel. 
Besides curing the headache, this exercise promotes a 
graceful carriage. 

Dangerous Practice.— I know of no more dangerous 
practice than to treat headache pain blindly with drugs, 
unless it be to treat insomnia with sedatives. Both lines 
of, treatment lead to the abuse of anodynes and hypnotics, 
and as a usual thing result in a continued condition of 
invalidism. 

Constipation. — One very common cause of headache 
which, if not the only cause, is, at least, a great factor in 
it, and amenable to home treatment with medicine, is 
constipation. Of course, outdoor exercise is the best 
possible thing for permanent cure. It is very easy to 
relieve most forms of headache by means of the coal-tar 
derivatives, of which so many are in the drug market. 
These form the basis of the many headache cures found on 
the druggists' shelves. Their use is not entirely without 
danger, for they are powerful heart depressants if taken 
in doses of any considerable size. 

Preventive. — After all, the best treatment for headache 
is preventive, and if we would all follow Kant's golden 
rule in disposing of each day, allotting eight hours for 
work, eight hours for play and eight hours for sleep, we 
would soon leave headaches and the ills attending them 
behind.

HOW TO CURE THE HEADACHE. 

Deflnition. — Megrim, hemicrania or sick-headache is a 
pain in the head coming on periodically ^.nd usually lo- 
cated in the left side of the head, accompanied by nausea 
and vomiting. Simple nervous headache may occur in 
any part of head, and comes on irregularly from many 
causes. 

CauseSt — The causes of headache are legion. Many 
diseases produce headache. Some of the most common 
causes are fever, colds, derangement of stomach or bowels 
(especially constipation), bad nutrition, and general de- 
bility. Rheumatic and gouty people are much subject to 
sick headache, and it is often hereditary. Insufficient sleep 
and mental worry are frequent exciting causes. 

Home Treatment. — Look for cause, and remove it if 
possible. Regulate the diet and keep the bowels in good 
condition. Plenty of out-door exercise with freedom 
from care, will prevent the attacks. For a throbbing head- 
ache, with flushed face, apply cold water or ice bag to the 
Iiead. Hot foot bath and inhalation of camphor, or mus- 
tard plaster on back of neck. For headache with pallor 
of face, and faintness on standing, apply hot water to the 
head freely, and inhalations of ammonia will often relieve. 

General Treatment. — For throbbing headache with 
(lushed face, ten to fifteen grains of the bromide of potas- 
sium will often relieve. For headache with pale coun-

tenance tlie inhalation of the nitrite of amyl will, if em 
ployed early, often cut siiort an attack of sick hcadacbu 
The following may be used occasionally: 
2 scruples of phenacetine, 
lo grains of citrate of caffeine. 
Mix and make into twenty capsules. 
Take one when necessary. 

Cannabis Indica taken in gradually increasing doses for 
many months will sometimes cure the headache perma- 
nently. Begin with quarter of a grain taken morning ami 
evening, and gradually increase, until two grains or more 
are taken at a dose. 

^ SICK HEADACHE. 

Cause. —Eating indigestible food, a lack of sufficient 
sleep, constipation, anxiety, want of out-door exercise, etc. 

Symptoms.— Dizziness, pain in the forehead and tem- 
ples, blurred sight, nausea and vomiting. 

Home Treatment.— Moderate diet, avoiding all rich 
gravies, late suppers, or stimulating drinks. Take a 
Seidlitz powder every morning and evening, or drink a 
cup of strong catnip tea just before retiring, or take two 
teaspoonfuls of finely powdered charcoal in half a glass of 
milk. Cover up warmly and perspire freely. 

HOME TREATMENT FOR DIARRHCEA. 

Great care should be taken not to check the difiicultv 
too soon. Look first carefully to the food and eat only 
moderately and very nutritious and very easily digested 
food. Rest and quiet is always necessary to promote a 
cure. If this is not sufficient, take half a teaspoonful of 
common soda three times a day, or take a few doses of 
rhubarb syrup, or blackberry cordial or blackberry wine.

tice for over thirty years, and it always efTecls a cure. 



Home Remedies and Home Treatment. 
A SURE CURE FOR DIARRHEA. 



135 



The plant called "White everlasting." botanical name 
Gncxphalium Polycephalum, is one of the best remedies for 
diarrhea. The plant is found in some parts of the United 
States and Canada. The following is the prescription: 

Take a handful of the herb, flowers and leaves includf^d, 
and boil in one pint of water. Strain the decoction a d 
boil down to one-half pint. Add an equal quantity of 
milk and bring to a boil so as to scald the milk. Dose: 
For adults, one half teacupful; for children, accordingly. 
If desired, it may be sweetened with white sugar. 



PLEURISY. 

Causo.— Violent strain or injury. It may be caused by 
other diseases, such as erysipelas, rheumatism, measles, 
etc., but It IS generally caused by sudden cold or exposure 
to dampness. 

Symptoms.— It penerally begins with a chill and a stitch- 
ing pain in the side. 

Homo Treatment.— In the first stages of the disease 
home treatment will generally be sufificient. A spirit vapor 
bath;. hot fomentations applied to the chest; or hot plates 
wrapped in a flannel and applied to the chest are excellent. 

General Treatment.— Give two or three drops of the 
tincture of aconite every three hours. If tWe patient is 
weak this remedy should not be pers^ted in. 




ASTHMA. 

The following is Eh*. Coffin's celebrated method of treat- 
ing asthma: To moderate the severity of the paroxysm 
inhale warm steam from an inhaler or the spout of a tea- 
pot. The treatment consists in giving a strong decoction 
of valerian root with cayenne, made very fine and well 
sweetened; immerse the feet of the patient in warm water, 
into which you may put a little mustard. Let him drink 
freely of a str nj tea of yarrow; after which give him half 
a teaspoonful of lobelia with a small quantity of cayenne 
pepper and half a teaspoonful of valerian; let this be re- 
peated till the patient vomits freely, which seldom fails to 
give relief.

Hoiv to Ascertain the State of the Lungs, 




HOW TO ASCERTAIN THE STATE OF THE LUNGS. 

Draw in as much breath as you can conveniently, then 
count as long as possible in a slow and audible voice with- 
out drawing in more breath. The number of seconds must 
be carefully noted. In a consumptive the time does not 
exceed, lo, and is frequently less than '6 seconds; in 
pleurisy and pneumonia it ranges from 9 to 4 seconds. 
When the lungs are sound, the time will range as high 
as from 20 to 35 seconds. To expand the lungs, go into 
the air, stand erect, throw back the head and shoulders, 
and draw in the air through the nostrils as much as pos- 
sible. 

After having then filled the lungs, raise your arms, still 
extended, and suck in the air. When you have thus forced 
the arms backward, with the chest open, change the pro- 
cess by which you draw in your breath, till the lungs are 
emptied. Go through the process several times a day, and 
it will enlarge the chest, give the lungs better play, and 
serve very much to ward of? consumption. 



How to Nurse Typhoid Fever. 



139 




How to Nurse Typhoid Fever. 

_ Physicians say that in many diseases nursing is of more 
importance than medicine. This is especially true of 
typhoid fever. It has to run a certain course, which can- 
not be cut short by medicine. The vital question is wheth- 
er the strength of the patient can be so husbanded as to 
keep hmi alive until the poison has spent itself. The 
seat of the disease is in the small intestine, which is ulcer- 
ated. The danger is that these ulcers may perforate the 
coat of the intestine and cause death. There is an un- 
reasoning fear of typhoid fever as a contagious disease 
It is not infectious if it is properly nursed. It can only 
be communicated from the discharges, and if these ar-^ 
thoroughly disinfected there is no danger. A plentiful 
supply of pure air is the first requisite. The room should 
be ventilated, and the temperature kept at 65°. If possi- 
ble the carpet should be taken up and the floor about the 
bed wiped up each day with a cloth,, wrung out of a solu- 
tion of bichloride of mercury, fifteen grains to a quart of 
^^^^u*"" r-r "™^Sist will weigh powders of sixty grains 
each One of these can be added to a gallon of v/ater and 
llie hquid used for disinfectant purposes. It is a deadly 
poison. 

The clothing should be changed whenever it is neces- 
sary. It IS inexcusable to permit soiled clothing to re- 
main near the patient because he is supposed to be too 
weak to bear having it replaced with fresh. If properly 
done it will not even tire or distress him. 

Water Cure.— Of all diseases the water cure has prob- 
ably accomp ished the greatest achievements in fevers. A 
fever asks for water— its natural remedy. One deep

TYPHOID FEVER. 

Deflnltion. — An acute sclf-liniiicd disease, due to a 
special poison; characterized by dull headache, fever, fol- 
lowed by stupor and delirium, diarrhcxa. tenderness of 
abdomen, which may show a peculiar eruption, rapid pros- 
tration and slow convalescence. 

Cause— Special typhoid germ called the bacillus typho- 
sus, which gains entrance to the system through infected 
water, milk, ice, meat or other food. The atmosphere is 
never impregnated with the fever germs. 

Symptoms.— Feeling of lassitude, headache, disturbed 
digestion and sleeplessness, coated tongue, chill or chilli- 
ness followed by fever, which is higher in the evening and 
gradually increases. Diarrhcca usually, and on the seventh 
day an eruption resembling flea-bites on abdomen. At 
the end of the third week the disease reaches its highest 
stage and the fever gradually abates. 

Home Treatment.— Keep the patient quiet, and give 
P'enty of fresh air and a nourishing liquid diet. Milk is 
the best; never give solid food, and give the milk in 
small quantities every two or three hours. Turpentine 
stupes applied over the abdomen to relieve the pain, and 
cool drink or pellets of ice slowly dissolved in the mouth 
to quench the thirst. Good nursing is of great import- 
ance. The urine and stools should be promptly disin- 
fected to prevent the spread of the disease, and a phy- 
sician should be consulted. 

MALARIA. 
(Ague Chills and Fever— Intermittent Fever.) 

Defliiition,— Disease characterized by a cold, a hot and 
a sweating stage, followed by an interval of complete in- 
termission; varying in length from a few hours to several 
days. 

Cause.— A special germ called bacillus malaria, aided by 
exposure to sudden cold, over-exertion, excess in eating 
and drinking, etc. 

Symptoms.— Chill, nausea and great thirst, followed by 
fever and headache, which gradually subsides as perspira- 
tion begisis, after which the person feels quite well, till the 
next chill comes on. 

Treatment. —During the intermission, give a brisk pur- 
gative followed by ten or twenty grains of quinine given 
three to five hours before the chill is expected. Repeat 
once or twice, and the paroxysms will be broken up. 
_ The fever is most frequent in swampy districts, and to 
insure a pern-innent cure, the patient must remove to a dry, 
healthtul locality.

Coughs and Colds. 



COUGHS AND COLDS. 

These are of so frequent occurrence that we treat them 
more at length, giving many excellent and valuable sug- 
gestions. The best remedy may fail where other means, 
diet, bathing, pufe air, etc., are neglected. 

Colds and Wlmt to Do with Them.— It would be well 
if we could begin by changing the name. The fact is that 
colds, so-called, are all poisonings, but are brought on in 
quite different ways. The nerves of the skin are shocked, 
and its excretory functions are arrested. The retained 
poison then causes the inflammation or "cold." Very 
comrnonly the skin has been put into an over-sensitive and 
inactive condition already by overheated rooms, over- 
dressing, neglect of bathing, or bad air; and then expoaure 
too slight to be recognized as such at the time does the 
rest. 

indigestion.— With many persons a " cold " comes on 
when they get digestion out of order, in certain ways. 
Hert the acrid fluids, produced in the alimentary canal by 
fermentation, are themselves the poison which throws the 
nuicous membrane of nose or throat into inflammation. 
Many colds, and especially that form accompanied 
by fever-sores on the lips, are due to infection. 

Cold Air, if pure, does the most of anything to limit the 
inflammation, and check the growth of germs in the in- 
flamed tissues. A Turkish bath or other sweat bath often 
helps immensely, by restored skin action. 

Diet. — The diet should be simple; any indigestible food 
or eating food rapidly makes the matters worse. Some 
do better on a limited allowance of food, even on fasting; 
others need a generous diet, though plain. 

Remedy.— Doses of oil, cod-liver oil, skunk's oil, goose 
grease, and many other sorts, have been found to help 
certain persons when suffering from colds; but not all. It 
is probably a question of digesting them or not. But 
whatever further medication one may elect, do not let it 
divert attention from the one greatest remedy — cold, pure 
air. 

Best Remedy.— There are many good Temedies for a 
cold, but the best remedy is not to take cold at all. 

The best way to do that, I find, is to have so good a 
supply of natural warmth within that outside temperature 
cannot easily lower it, and this I achieve by keeping my 
blood always full of the oxygen in fresh air, and flowing 
swiftly by reason of plenty of exercise. Then, to let my

skin do its natural work of being warm, elastic water-tight 
covering for my flesh, keeping it so by the free use of cold 
water— instead of the warm water which opens the pores 
and relaxes the skin's elasticity and by clothing it in such a 
way that its exudations are soaked up and carried off 
quickly. 

First Stage.— To treat a cold successfully no time should 
be wasted at its incipient stage. The herald of approach is 
usually noticed in heaviness of the eyes and a dull, pe- 
culiarly "big" feeling of the head similar to the effect of 
quinine. Physicians say that one in perfect health does 
not contract a cold; it is only when some of the bodily 
organs fail to perform their regular duties that the cold 
makes attack upon the system. 

Quinine.— Two-grain doses of quinine administered 
every two hours during the day are often all that is neces- 
sary to keep the enemy at bay— by toning up the system 
and making it impregnable. These doses may be taken in 
capsules or in cold liquid coffee; the latter covers up the 
bitter taste almost entirely and prevents it from lingering 
in the mouth. Soaking the feet in hot mustard water just 
before retiring, quickly followed by a hot lemonade, is 
efficacious. 

Cu'>eb. — If the nostrils are stopped so as to prevent easy 
respiration, crush cubeb berries in a cloth and smoke them 
in a new clap pipe, forcing the smoke through the head 
and nostrils. The head will be as clear as a bell in five 
minutes, so that you can breathe naturally and all night. 
Use this remedy only before retiring, or when you can re- 
main within doors, as it is said to open the pores to the 
extent of placing the system in great danger if exposed 
to the air very soon after using. Cubeb smoke disinfects 
and heals and will curs catarrh if used '°very night regu- 
larly. 

Hoarseness.- For hoarseness, vaseline is good; take as 
much as will adhere to the finger; allow it to slowly creep 
down the throat several times a day and at bed time. This 
IS excellent for croupy children, and it is not difficult to 
induce them to take it, for it is nearly tasteless. A fresh 
egg beaten and thickened with sugar, freely eaten, will 
relieve hoarseness, or take a lemon or sour orange, open 
one end, dig out the inside, sweeten and eat. 

Ginger.— Ginger in hot or cold milk, sweetened a little,

Remedy for a Sore Throat. 




REMEDY FOR A SORE THROAT. 

A thin slice of raw fat pork dusted with cayenne pepper 
is by good authority considered the best remedy for a sore 
throat, and this is the way to apply it, so the greasy strip 
shall be securely held in place, poulticing the throat from 
ear to ear and not slipping down on the collar bone, where 
it can do little good to swollen tonsils, or rolling away from 
the throat altogether. 

Cut a strip of flannel three and one-half inches wide and 
long enough to pass under the chin and tie on top of the 
head. Halve this strip lengthwise, leaving an uncut five or 
six inch length in the center on which to baste the pork. 
When this has been sprinkled with cayenne and applied to 
the throat, tie the upper strings snugly on top of the head 
and the lower ones at the back of th eck. 

Another Remedy.— For sore throat, use an ointment 
made of equal parts of melted mutton tallow and kerosene 
oil, stirred until cold, to successfully incorporate the oil; 
apply outwardly and wrap the throat with a soft cotton 
cloth; woolen cloth heats, and is liable to blister. 

Home-Made Gargle.— For local treatment of the throat, 
the simple home-made gargle of vinegar, salt and water is 
good for a slight attack, but for one more severe, dissolve 
chlorate of potash in water in the proportion of a tea- 
spoonful of chlorate to a pint of water. Gargle the throat 
every half hour, using aution about swallowing much 
of it, as the chlorate is poisonous if taken in large quan- 
tities. Physicians recommend this in case of diphtheria. 

For Ordinary Sore Throat.— Nothing surpasses a wet 
bandage passed around the throat at night, covered by 
numerous folds of dry woolen goods. A shawl will serve 
for this. Rub the throat well with tepid water, followed 
by lanoline ointment, when the compress is taken off. 

Benefits of Oargling.— If people would wash out their 
mouths twice or three times a day with an antiseptic solu- 
tion, there would not be near so much sickness. There are 
any number of proprietary antiseptics that are excellent for 
this purpose, but many more simple agents that are as good 
or better. One of the best of the latter is carbolic acid. A 
very weak solution of this, gargled and held in the mouth 
two •or three times a day, will work wonders. Immediate- 
ly af'er using, one will find that the mouth feels cleaner. 
A great majority of the common throat and lung troubles 
come from the lodgment of disease microbes within the 
mucous membranes of the mouth. The free use of anti- 
septics will kill these gernxSt

HOW TO CURE A SORE THROAT. 



147 



Home Treatment.— Sage tea as a gargle and also as a 
drink. Make a gargle of the following prescription: 
Chloride of potash, i drachm, 
Tincture of iron, 20 drops, 
Water, i glass. 
Mix, and gargle the throat every hour. 
A Domestic Remedy. 
2 tablespoonfuls of common salt, 

2 tablespoonfuls of strained honey, "' 

3 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
J4 teaspoonful of camphor. 

Mix and gargle the throat a dozen times a day. 

EXTERNAL APPLICATION FOR SORE THROAT. 

Wring a cloth out of salt and cold water and, keeping it 
quite wet, bind tightly about the neck and cover with a 
dry cloth. It is best to use this at night. 

INCONTINENCE OF THE URINE. 

Definition,— When a person cannot retain urine, and 
also has a frequent desire to urinate. It is a troublesome 
and annoying disease. One may be passing urine uncon- 
sciously during sleep, or may dribble away, which general- 
ly causes chafing and soreness. 

Cansea.— In children it may be caused by worms, or 
drinking too much water before retiring, or injuries or 
weakness of the organ. In adults, paralysis of the bladder 
or weakness. 

Home Treatment.— Avoid all acid or salty food, tea, 
coffee and alcoholic liquors. The patient should take a 
cold bath every day, rubbing the skin thoroughly with a 
rough towel afteV each bath; have out-door exercise; sleep 
on a hard mattress, and avoid hot drinks toward evening. 

Regular Treatment.— If the difficulty is worms, that 
should be remedied at once; if caused by paralysis or 
weakness of the bladder, take one drop of tincture of 
cantharides three times a day and keep the bowels open. 
DIABETES (Excessive Quantities of Urine.) 

Causes. — It is difificult to say what causes this disease, 
but it is generally conceded to be exposure, intemperance, 
injuries and certain fevers. It is as common to men as to 
women. 

Symptoms. — Excessive quantities of urine of a very palq 
yellowish hue or quite colorless, which contains sugar in 
large quantities; thirst, lassitude, and great dryness and 
harshness of the skin, also loss of flesh.

Home Remedies and Home Treatment. 




I : ' 



Home Troatmont. — Avoid all food containing starch and 
sugar, such as bread, vegct.iblcs, pie and cake. Eat meats 
of all kinds, eggs and bran bread, drink skim-milk and 
butter-milk; cotlee may be taken without sugar. Avoid 
severe exercise, aiid bathe the skin thoroughly and fre- 
quently. A competent physician should be consulted. 

GRAVEL. • 

Definition. — Gravel is caused by small stony substances 
which form in the kidneys or the bladder, and are often 
passed with the water. Some are subject to gravel every 
few months, but where the stone becomes large an oper- 
ation is necessary. 

Syiiiptuiiis. — Pain in the end of the jjcnis, constant de- 
sire to make water, pain in the bladder just before urinat- 
ing, bloody urine. The only way to determine the exist- 
ence of a gravel in the bladder is by the use of a surgical 
instrument. If the patient sufifers from any of the above 
symptoms, the family physician should be consulted at 
once. 

Home Treatment. — Avoid intoxicating liquors and drink 
only soft water, lemonade, milk, cider, alkaline, mineral 
and soda waters; avoid eating sugar, butter, fat meat, and 
exercise freely out of doors. The patient should take a 
tumbler of cold water an hour before dinner and at bed 
time; frequent baths and warm clothing are necessary. 
When suffering from pain, drink a copious quantity of 
flax-seed tea. 

BRIGHT'S DISEASE. 

Definition. — Bright's disease is a disease of the kidneys 
known by the presence of a substance called albumen in 
the urine. It is more frequently caused by the use of 
alcoholic liquors, exposure to cold, wet, etc. 

Symptoms. — A pale and puffy appearance of the face; 
general pains and weakness; headache and lassitude. 

Home Treatment. — A good test for Bright's Disease is 
the following: Take a wineglassful of urine and put into 
it a few drops of nitric acid; if the patient is suffering 
from Bright's disease, the urine will have a white cloudy 
appearance. Hard work and severe exercise must be 
avoided. Wear good warm flannel next to the skin; keep 
the bowels open and take a warm bath every day. Take 
cod liver oil, drink skim-milk and eat noMrishing food. If 
dropsy makes an appearance, it may be checked by drink- 
ing freely of cream of tartar lemonade.

THE HUMAN STOMACH. 

HOW TO CURE DYSPEPSIA. 

Cause. —Excessive and fast eating, irregulaj time fp' 
meals, eating too much, sedentary habits, improper use >A 
purgative drugs, hard study, or hard work just before or 
after meals, tight lacing, etc. 

Symptoms. — Irregular appetite, pain in the stomach, 
furred tongue, offensive breath, nausea, bad taste in tin; 
mouth in the morning, an irritable feeling in the stomach 
after each meal, sour or bitter fluids arising from the 
stomach, heart-burn, etc. 

Home Treatment. — Regular rest and regular exercise. 
Retire early and arise moderately early, Avoid eating 
pie, cake, pork, sausage, hard dried meats, cheese, lob- 
sters, crabs, pastry of all kinds, canned salmon, >oups, 
and newly baked bread; also nil kinds of beer and 1 iiuors. 
Eat oatmeal, cracked wheat, graham bread and au kinds 
of fruits that will agree with the patient. Masticate the 
food thoroughly and eat slowly. Drink a glass of hot 
milk before each meal. A little pepsin taken immediately 
after each meal will often give great relief. Drink nothing 
while eating. 

Common Treatment. — The following prescription is 
one of the best that is known and no doubt has cured as 
many people as any one prescription given by a physician: 

"Dyspepsia Cure." 

2 drachms hyposulphite of soda, 

2 drachms sub. nit. bismuth. 
Mix. Make into twelve powders. 

Take one powder every three hours in little water or 
milk. 



Home Remedies and Home Treatment. J5l 

"EGYPTIAN DYSPEPSIA CURE." 

Powdered rhubarb, 2 drachms. 
Bicarbonate of soda, 6 drachms. 
Fluid extract of gentian, .1 drachms. 
Peppermint water, 71^ ounces. 
Mix them. 

One teaspoonful in a little cold water half an hour be 
fore meals. 

JAUNDICE. 

Cause.— Excesses in eating and drinking; a debauch; 
dyspepsia, or the use of alcoholic drinks; some obstruction 
in the bile duct, as a gall stone or currant seed; malaria; 
climate, as cool nights succeeding warm days. 

Symptoms.— Derangement of the stomach and bowels, 
constipation, diarrhoea, or bitter taste in the mouth, thirst, 
indigestion, skin has a peculiar yellow color and itches, 
slight feverishness, whites of eyes yellow, stools become 
clay colored, and spirits depressed. 

Home Treatment. —Give a warm bath niaht and morn- 
ing, adding to the water an ounce of carbonate of potas- 
sium, and give a good laxative, as a tablespoonful of 
epsom salts. Allow the patient to drink a glass of lem- 
onade once in four hours made with bitartrate of potas- 
sium. Restrict the diet to milk if possible, avoiding all 
starchy, fatty or sweet articles 01 food. 

BILIOUS ATTACKS. 

Symptoms.— Dizziness, loss of appetite, coated tongue, 
drowsiness, tired feeling, vomiting of bile, etc. 

Home Treatment.— Take a dessertspoonful of cream of 
tartar and stir it into a pint of boiling water, and when 
cool drink it on an empty stomach. Repeat this about 
twice a day. Then drink a good strong tea made from 
the root of dandelion two or three times a day, one good 
dose just before retiring. Or a little common soda taken 
two or three times a day will often give the desired re- 
sults. A few doses of quinine will often be all that is nec- 
essary.

Constipation. 



A STOMACH'S PLEA. 

"Give me only plain food, and not too much, and I 
will ensure a speedy digestion and excellent health; but 
how am I to dispose of the mass of costly rubbish that I 
am daily compelled to receive? Soup, beef, venison, veg- 
etables, puddings, jellies, fruits, wine and many superfluous f 
delicacies. How can any sensible stomach digest such a 
mass of amalgamated matter? The stomach of a plowman, 
having only plain food to digest, has little labor compared 
Avith mine. He assists his stomach in its digestive opera- 
tions by taking plenty of good, refreshing exercise, while 
my owner, after arresting my power of digestion, adds 
thereto by taking no exercise. Is it strange that my 
owner is sick? Give me proper treatment and doctors 
and doctor bills can be dispensed with." 

CONSTIPATION. 

Dr. W. C. Lyman Truly Says:— There is one remark- 
able remedy that can be published here or anywhere. It 
may meet the "How?" of some despairing sufferer, who 
has endured many things in the way of taking of adver- 
tised remedies, and has been regularly and irregularly pre- 
scribed for more times than he can remember. It is this: 
Simply to chew the food finer. 

Hot Biscuits. — The worst thing to be said against hot 
biscuit, pancakes, and fresh bread is that they tempt us 
to swallow them hastily. This ends in undissolved lumps 
of dough rolled together in the stomach, in which lumped- 
up condition they remain to the end. 

Laxatives.— The drugs that act as laxatives all have a 
deplorable drawback in common. They leave the bowel 
torpid and insensitive to the stimulus of its ordinary con- 
tents. In other words, they must be taken continuous'y, 
once their use is started, as a habit, or constipation sets in 
worse than ever as the true and legitimate result of their 
employment. The more irritating and "active" the drug, 
the more profound the exhaustion of sensibility and 
vital activity that comes on after the drug has had its first 
effect. Among these drugs I do not class the ox-bile, now

,Z\ V ' ^•^^^'■^ beginning that expensive makeshift 
the axative, give the matter long and careful study To 
swallow a laxative is the beginning of defeat. 

Two Simple Remedies.-Two simple procedures will 
usually restore normal action to the bowels^ Drink a pTit 
of cold water before breakfast, a half a spoonful o? less 
at a time that is, in little sips, the whole sipping exercise 
taking at least twenty minutes. Chew the fo?d to a cream 
so thoroughly, that is, that it can not very well go into 
solid form again but will blend with the digestive juices 
particularly the bile, and remain fluid. ^ ' 

Diet.— Coffee and tea, sugar spices, pastry, and hot 
biscuit are to be avoided. Dry toast, or Sme other 
equivalent of the German zwieback (which must be chewed 
o be swallowed), fruit, vegetables of the succulent varie- 
ties, and rare-done meats are the best foods. Some are 
helped by graham bread; some by figs (the seeds acting as 
exciters of peristalsis); sedentary persons by regular exer- 

r^niPnTi w7^"^^?'°"l°* ^ "^^^'r glycerine for temporary 
relief are better policy than an irritant taken by the mouth 
-jwhich must disturb and exhaust the sensibility of the 
whole alimentary tract, as it passes along. Ox-gall in 
capsules is an internal remedy -vhich has not this ob- 
jection, and which is a fair temporary measure where the 
liver is at fault. 

Great Abase.— Let no remedy, however, divert atten- 

tion from the great abuse, an abuse from which constipa- 
lon must be expected and considered due— that of swal- 
owing food without masticating it well. The writer has 
known constipation that has resisted all the supposed 
remedies to disappear at once and permanently, when the 
sufferer began chewing her food to the consistence of 
cream. 

Old Age.-In old age a daily drive or gently massage of 
the bowels are often advisable. Horseback exercise will 
benefit a good many. Some cases, where constipation is 
due to a nervous or dynamic cause, yield to high grade 
homeopathy. More fats, such as butter, in the dietary help 
others. But however hard the problem may be, more 
stuiy IS what is called for, not a laxative medicine

Home Remedies and Home Treatment. 



CONSTIPATION. 

Deflnition. — Inactivity of the intestines or bowels, due 
to weak condition of the muscular walls of the bowels— 
or the lack of proper amount of fluid — from deficient 
secretions of bile, intestinal fluid, or often from a lack 
of fluid diet. 

Causes. — Dyspepsia, sedentary habits, disease of the 
liver, character of food, irregular habits, malaria, and 
lead poisoning. 

Symptoms. — In healthy condition the majority of per- 
sons have one stool each day. In constipation, the bowels 
are moved every three or four days, with great straining 
and distress. 

Home Treatment.— 

1. Beware of harsh purgatives, they make matters 
worse. 

2. A regular hour each day must be established for 
going to stool. 

3. Sufficient time must be taken to permit the bowels 
to become thoroughly evacuated. 

4. Careful regulation of the diet; not too much nor too 
little food should be taken. Avoid tea, cheese, crackers, 
all highly seasoned food, and eat plenty of fruit with 
coarse bread, such as graham, and cornmeal, ginger-bread 
made with molasses, and oatmeal porridge. Plenty of 
water should be taken between meals. 

These rules should be rigidly enforced before any per- 
manent cure can be hoped for. 

An orange eaten before breakfast, or at night before 
retiring, often acts well. 

A glass of hot water taken half an hour before break- 
fast with a pinch of salt is beneficent. 

Regular Treatment. — If the above rules are complied 
with, the following may be used with benefit: 

Fluid extract of cascara sagrada, 4 drachms, 

Glycerine, i 1-3 drachms. 

Syrup sarsaparilla, 2 2-3 drachms. 

Take one teaspoonful an hour after meals, or once a 
day as needed. 

A glycerine suppository or a teaspoonful of glycerine, 
used as an enema, may act well. 

In acute cases a dose of epsom salts or castor oil should 
be used, Or an injection Oi warm soap suds.

RHEUMATISM. 

Rheumatism is divided into acute, chronic and muscular. 

Acute Rheumatism is sometimes called rheumatic fever. 
This is generally brought on by exposure to cold, and 
affects the joints, wh'ch become painful and swollen. 

Chronic Rheumatism is similar to acute rheumatism, 
with the exception that there is an absence of increased 
heat and redness. It is supposed to be the same as the 
acute form, only it is milder, but more persistent. 

Muscular Rheumatism is a disease which aflfects the 
muscles, and often shifts from one place to another, but 
usually remains fixed in the muscles first attacked. The 
muscles in the back part of the neck and shoulders are 
very frequently attacked, also the muscles of the back. 




156 



Home i emcdies and Home Treatment. 



m 



Causf. — Usually an inherited tendency; exciting causes 
or exposure to cold, excessive meat diet and insufficient 
exercise. 

Symptoms. — Pain in the joints, tenderness, swelling or 
redness of the skin, swelling of the joints^ and soreness of 
the muscles 

Home Treatment. — Wrap the red or swollen parts in 
flannel soaked in ho. water or in a hot solution of common 
baking soda and water. Small mustard plasters placed 
over the affected joints or parts are highly recommended. 
Two or three tablespoonfuls ot lemon juice in a glass of 
water three or four times a day often produce excellent 
results. For muscular rheumatism keep the affected parts 
warm and bathe two or three times a day with arnica. Rub 
it in with a coarse flannel, stimulating the muscles by thor- 
ough rubbing. A hot bath at bed time to induce fiee 
perspiration. 

A rheumatic person should wear woolen garments next 
the skin and also sleep in warm blankets during the cold 
season of the year. Take a good dose of rhubarb at bed- 
time. 

NERVOUSNESS. 

It is not a disease, but it is a derangement of the nervous 
system, and may be produced by various causes; mental 
work, fatigue, anxiety etc. 

Home Treatment. — Rest; a cloth wet with cold water 
tied upon the head at night; a good bath every day. Diet 
of graham bread, milk, with plenty of cream and the fat 
of beef and mutton. Seek for the cause and iemove it if 
possible. 

Fat for the Nervons. — Nervous people should eat fat 
food. Every irritable and exhaustive nerve should, if 
possible, be coated with fat. Fat is to a tender nerve what 
an air cushion is to a tired invalid — it eases jolts wonder- 
fully. With the fat should be combined grain foods and 
vegetables for strength, and fruits to keep up a healthful 
consistency of the blood. 

OPIATES INCREASE NERVOUSNESS. 

The longer you take opiates the less you will sleep, as 
they will tend to make you nervous and restless. Bravely 
give them up and depend upon alkalies which are mild 
sedatives and upon tincture of hyoscyamus, which is 
soothing to the nerves. 

Take bromide of potash, borax, salt and phosphate of 
sodium, one drachm of each, dissolved in half a pint of 
water, which contains sixteen large spoonfuls of water, 
roufirhly estimated. Dose, a large spoonful four times

a day. Drink Dutch cocoa, milk, or water, or any effer- 
vescing drink, but no tea or coffee. 

In the evening, fifteen or thirty drops of tincture of 
hyoscyamus in a little water. 

If your spine is hot apply a towel wrung out in hot 
water to the small of the back or nape ot the neck for 
ten or twenty minutes, taking care not to wst your nieht 
clothes or to take cold. ^ 

All these measures will quiet your nerves and when time 
is given to overcome the force of the opium habit, if it 
has been formed, you will get sweeter rest than you ever 
got from opium. As soon as you begin to sleep enough 
drop the hyoscyamus. 

ERYSIPELAS. 

Erysipelas is accompanied with drowsiness and some- 
times delirium when it affects the face and head. It is 
produced by exposure to sudden changes of heat and cold 
vyhich close up the excretory vessels and prevent perspira- 
tion. It is preceded by cold shiverings. with alternate 
flushings and fever. 

Treatment.— Wash the sffected parts and the surround- 
ing skin with soap, and then apply a solution consisting of 
one part carbolic acid to twenty parts of alcohol. Instead 
of the alcohol some take common mucilage: others vase- 
line. 

Another method is to apply compresses wet with a solu- 
tion of salicylate of soda, one part to twenty of water, cov- 
ering the compresses with rubber gutta-percha tissue. 

CANCER. 

The following treatment has completely cured several 
persons of cancer, and is vouched for: Take sheep sorrel, 
the variety with yellow flower, bruise the whole stalk, 
flower and all, and press out the juice. Boil it down one- 
half and bottle. Apply with a quill three or four times a 
day. Wash the sore with castile soap between applica- 
tions. Drink red clover blossom tea. 

One individual well known to "the writer, finding no re- 
lief after submitting to a surgical operation, used the 
above simple remedy, and was cured. Many years have 
passed, but there are »-\o symptoms of the disease left. 

ECZEMA. 

An ointment of equal parts of zinc and tar is good. A 
solution of two teaspoonfuls of soda to a pint of water is 
another good application.

How to Vacciftate. 







HOW TO TACCINATE. 



Vaccination was for a long time considered a perfect 
specific against small-pox, and the blood once influenced 
by the lymph of cow-pox would, it was supposed, ever 
afterward repel the disease of small-pox, however the pa- 
tient might be exposed to its infection. Experience, how- 
ever, has proved this to be a fallacy, and that persons, 
although twice vaccinated, may be attacked by the dreaded 
disease. It is, however, satisfactory to know that after 
vaccination, small-pox, if it should occur, is always mild, 
seldom pits the skin, and is never dangerous. 

B£M£DT FOR SMALL-POX. 

I grain sulphate of zinc; i grain foxglove (digitalis). 
J^ teaspoonful sugar. 

Mix with 2 teaspoonfuls of water, add 4 oz. of water. 
Dose, I spoonful every hour, child in proportion. From 
experience it is known that nothing will break up this 
frightful disease sooner than continued and persevering 
bathing, with the water at a comfortable temperature. 

HEARTBURN (Acidity of the Stomach.) 

There is no such thing as heartburn. What is com- 
monly called heartburn, is nothing more nor less than 
acidity of the stomach, or a derangement of the digestive 
organs, and can be easily remedied by taking half a table- 
spoonful of powdered magnesia, or half a teaspoonful of 
saleratus, or by drinking a little lime uater, or by drop- 
ping a few burning coals of hardwood to a tumbler of 
water, and drinkino' the water. 



Saving the Eyet. 



159 



SAVING THE EYES. 

When the e3'es are sore or inflamed, what shall be done 
for their relief? Rest is the first essential, and in a severe 
case, let this mean darkness obtained by a bandage of 
black cloth, for a day or two. Rest of the body and 
mind, If the eye trouble is the result of overwork is the 
next essential. Go where the air is pure. It is said that 
hundreds of cases of loss or impairment of sight among 
workingmen in large cities could be prevented every year 
if oculists could send these sufferers for three months to a 

*^°^?*i'^ ^°J"^- ^^^"^^ ^'"d' d"sl, and smoke. 

Ulet.— The diet should be limited and readily digestible. 
Very little should be taken at supper. The food should be 
masticated very thoroughly. 

Dr. Agnew.— The late Dr. Agnew ur.ed to relate to his 
dasses a case where an elderly man came many miles to 
XNIew York to be operated on for an ulcerous malady of 
the eyeball. The surgeons in the hospital declined to 
operate, considering the proc-s to be too far advanced 
Dr. Agnew chanced to see him at table, and stepped in. 
He sat down beside him and showed him how to eat 
Two weeks later he went home well, without operation or 
other treatment. 

First Offcage.— The first offense against the eyes is read- 
ing or writing in a poor light. Clerks who work by gaslight 
in poorly lighted buildings in cities, especially during the 
short, clouded days of winter, furnish many cases of sore 
and tired eyes. If gaslight must be used to any extent for 
close work, the eyes should be shaded, and care must be 
taken not to have more light in one eye than in the other. 

second Offense.— The second offense is reading with the 

Tf,i^^"«S-'^^'"- '^^l ^^^3^\ congestion of the eyeball. 

Third OlTense.— The third is reading on trains. Here 
the stream of ol iects flying past at the window strains an 
eye that is also engaged with the printed page. Too many 
changes of focus, and too many uses of the muscles of fix- 
aMon, strain the powers of the eyes. 

All abuses of the sight bring their retribution as old 
age comes on, if not sooner. 

Eye Olaoses.— An experienced oculist says that a great 
many people injure their eyesight by not keeping their 
glasses bright and highly polished. They fllow dust or 
moisture to accumulate upon them ; then they are dim and 
semi-opaque, and the eyes are strained by trying to look 
through them. For properly cleaning eyeglasses a 
Japanese paper napkin is said to be excellent.

HOW TO DOCTOR SORE EYES. 

(' a II s C! , — Exposure to 
cold, dust, injuries, catarrh, 
scarlet fever, measles, etc. 
When the eye feels as if 
there were fire sand in it, a 
competent ph'\sician should 
be at once consulted, be- 
cause it is a symptom of 
inflammation which de- 
mands special attention. 

Home Treatment.— Bathe the eyes every two or three 
hours in warm water. Place a few grains of alum in the 
water before using. Cleanliness is very necessary. Tiie 
application o^ a cloth moistened with a solution cf aconite 
in the proportion of one part of aconite to twenty of water 
will prove soothing and beneficial. Never apply hot fo- 
mentations to the eye without consulting a physician \ 
rubber bag or bladder filled with pounded ice and held to 
the eye is a good and safe remedy.

HOW TO CURE EARACHE. 

Home Treatment. —Apply hot fomen-

the ear will often furnish relief. If an 
insect gets into the ear, d tp into the

A CURE FOR FROST BITES. 
If any portion of the body has been frozen, keep the 
person away from all heat until you can apply snow or 
cold water. Rub the parts carefully, but thorouf?hly, until 
the frozen flesh becomes soft and assumes a natural color. 
It is best to rub the frozen part an hour or more while 
thawing. Apply olive oil or lard after the rubbing has 
been completed.

Apoplexy, Bad Breath and Quinsy. 



Ill 



1. Apoplexy. -Apoplexy occurs only in the corpulent 
or obese, and those of gross or high living. 

Treatnioiit.-Raise the head to a nearly upright position, 
loosen all tight clothes, strings, etc.. and apply cold water 
to the head and warm water and warm cloths to the icet 
Have the apartment cool and well ventilated. Give noth- 
ing by the mouth until the breathing is relieved, and then 
only draughts of cold water. 

2. Bad Breath—Bad or foul breath will be removed by 
taking a teaspoonful of the following mixture after each 
meal: One ounce chloride of soda, one ounce liquor of 
potassa, one and one-half ounces phosphate of soda, and 
three ounces of water. 

3. Quinsy. -This is an inflammation of the tonsils or 
common inflammatory sore throat; commences with a 
slight feverish attack, with considerable pain and swelling 
of the tonsils, causing some difficulty in swallowing; as 
the attack advances, these symptoms become more in- 
tense; there is headache, thirst, a painful sense of tension 
and acute darting pains in the ears. The attack is gener- 
ally brought on by exposure to cold, and lasts from five 
to seven days, when it subsides naturally, or an abscess 
may form in tonsils and burst, or the tonsils may remain 
enlarged, the inflammation subsiding. 

Home Treatment. -The patient should remain in a 
warm room, the diet chiefly milk and good broths, some 
cooling laxative and diaphoretic medicine may be given- 
but the greatest relief will be found in the frequent in- 
halation o the steam of hot water through an inhaler, or 
in .ne o.d-fashiuned way through the spout of a teapot.

now TO CURE PILES. 

Doflnltloii.— riles are divide 1 into two kinds, internal 
and c.\ ■■rnal, according to ilic location. 

Cause. — Ilabitnal constipation, violent horseback riding, 
indiRostion, the use of strong cathartics, dysentery, wear- 
ing corsets, eating iiighly seasoned food, etc. 

Homo Treatment.— Use an injection of a pint of cold 
water every morning and take a few grains of rhubarb 
daily; this will often cure cases of long standing, or take 
an injection of alum and water of the strength of one or 
two teasi^oonfuls of alum to a pint of water, or take two 
grains of sulpliatc of iron to an ounce of water. An in- 
jection of this will stoj) the bleeding. 

Where there is much pain a hip-bath of fifteen to twenty 
minutes, if the pain is very severe it will procUice relief. 
Apply a bread and milk poultice four or five times a day 
is also a good remedy. 

CHOLERA MORBUS. 

Canfle. — It is more prevalent in warm than in cold 
climates. It is usually the result of eating excessively of 
indigestible articles, such as iniripe fruits, uncooked vege- 
tables, melons, or intoxicating drinks. 

Symptoms.— Nausea, vomiting and purging, cramps and 
pains, sometimes intense thirst and quick pulse. 

Home Treatment.— Let the patient remain quiet and 
lie in bed. Take a teaspoonful of saleratus every two or 
three hours, or make a good strong tea of rhubarb root 
and drink freely. Drop a few live hardwood coals in a 
tumbler of water and drink the water; repeat this every 
two hours. Or make a strong tea of the leaves or bark of 
the peach tree and drink freely every few minutes. Avoid 
drinking cold water. 

Any of the above domestic remedies will be found effi- 
cient and helpful. 

NIGHT SWEATS. 

Night sweats are generally a symptom of weakness, and 
can easily be remedied by toning up the system by eating 
nourishing food, such as beefsteak, oatmeal, cracked 
wheat, baked potatoes, fruits, etc. A good tonic may be 
taken. Bathe the body in salt water every other day. A 
good dose of sage tea before retiring will prove very 
beneficial.

cause intense itching. 

2. Cause.— Bad air, unwholesome food, unventilated 
houses, dirty beds and clothing. It can only be communi- 
cated by contact. 

3. Symptoms.— It begins with slight eruptions between 
the fingers, on the finger joints, on the wrist, under the 
arms, on the thighs, etc. 

4. Remedy.- Keep the bowels open and regular. Take 
flower of sulphur and lard or fresh butter enough to make a 
good ointment and anoint the body all over every night 
before retiring. • Wash thoroughly with warm water every 
morning. 

5. Take internally a teaspoonf ul of flower of sulphur and

your hands on your hips, and twist the trunk to the side 
of the rear foot as far as possible; then change feet and 
twist to the opposite side. Repeat fifteen times to each 
side. Do the same twisting uiLii your hands clasped be- 
hind your neck, your shoulders well held back. 

Stride standing. Rise on your toes and bend your knees 
outward and downward. Repeat ten times slowly. 

Stand on one foot, your hips firm, and slowly raise your 
other leg, extended in front j keep a steady balance. 
Change feet and repeat. 

Stand with your heels together, your hands on your 
hips Bend your body forward, to the side, backward and 
to the opposite side, then forward to complete the circle. 
Repeat and rotate your body in opposite directions. 

Lie on your face, with your hips firm and your feet held 
under a bureau; try to raise your head and shoulders as 
far as possible, with deep inspiration. Repeat, turning 
your body. 

Bend your body over a bar in the doorway, or your 
stair railing, backward, forward and sideways,' with your 
hands clasped behind your neck. 

Place your bar low; hang under it with your body ex- 
tended stiffly and resting on your heels. Slowly araw your 
chest up to touch the bar by bending your elbows out- 
ward. Repeat. 

Combine these movements with deep resoiration, open- 
ing a window for good, pure air; make each exercise as 
useful to the muscles as possible; they are corrective exer- 
cises—not merely amusing. Rub your stomach with cold 
water after the exercise. This treatment persevered in 
with self-restraint at the table, is the best for dyspepsia 
and weak lungs. 

A PALATABLE LAXATIVE. 

Make a strong, concentrated infusion of senna leaves; 
strain this through a muslin cloth and boil in the strained 
liquid as many prunes of good quality as can be well 
boiled in the quantity of infusion. Stew the prunes in the 
liquor thoroughly, in the same manner as if for the table 
properly seasoning. When well cooked put in a glass 
jar, screw the top down tightly, and set away in a cool 
place. Two or three or four of these prunes, eaten during 
the day, will overcome some of the severest cases of con- 
stipation. There is no suggestion whatever of the senna 
in the taste of the prunes, and the effect is most desirable, 
if taken at bedtime, when a laxative is desired the bowels 
will move nicely in. the morning.

A Brief History of Medicine. 



\V I 



I! »i 




A BRIEF insTORT OF MEDICINE. 

Ancient Greeks.— The ancient Greeks in their desire to 
honor the healing art, clierishcd the myth thnt *»- - first 
knowledge of medicino came from god:- .J Ucwigods 
The Romans, though in general more practical than the 
Greeks, evinced less sense of the importance of the healing 
art, and for centuries held practices of medicine in 
small esteen,. Foreigners who tried to establish the 
art at Rome ere looked on with contempt and sus- 
picion. 

Cato.— The elder Cato said that these doctors came 
to Rome A> put an end to the people. He cautioned 
his friends to let them alone, and preferred to treat 
his family and neighbors from an old hand-book of 
medical recipes which had probably been delivered to 
him by his ifather, who in turn had received it from 
his progenitors. 

Romans. — Romans of means had [ lysicians in their 
own houses. These men were slaves, for, odd as it seems 
many Roman slaves were accomplished in literature, art 
and science. At one time the selling price of a slave 
doctor was about the equivalent of three hundred dol- 
lars in our money. 

Julius Caesar.— After the time of Julius Csesar, who 
encouraged physicians, the art began ^o "lift its head" 
in Rome, and later men of character ^nd position, though 
generally foreigners, entered the profession. Some of 
them accumulated large lo tunes, and o- > made the 
equivalent of at least five tindrcf' thous, 1 dollars in 
a few years. 

In some countries, where physicians did not thrive, sick 
people were placed on the road-.side, that travelers who had 
suffered with like maladies mi' \a uggest remfi'ies. 

Drug Shop«j.— Such crude efforts were supi.>lanted at 
Rome by shops, in which various drugs and medicines 
were sold. Then, as now, quacks abounde ' and the 
government, for the protection of the oeopic ordered 
that all remedies should bear a label d -inr^ the char- 
acter of the medicine, the name of its / it. the sick- 
ness for which it was prepared, with a of s ingredi- 
ents and full directions as to the way in which it should 
be tat' . 

Dl8Ci_ders of Stomach.— For disorders of the stomach 
a fiavorite prescriptioK w-as to the effect that the sufferer 
shDuld read aloud in a clear distinct tone some book or 
speech, and then take moderate exercise.

'2 EFFECTS OF CIGARETTE 

Sft^OKlNG. 



Cigarettes have heeii analyzed, and most physicians 
and chemists were suryrsed to find how much opium is 
put into them. A tobacconist himself says that "the ex- 
tent to which drugs are used in cigarettes is appalling." 
"Havana flavoring" for this same purpose is sold every- 
where by the thousand barrels. This flavoring is made 
from the tonka-bean, which contains a deadly poison. 
The wrappers, warranted to be rice paper, are sometimes 
made of common paper, and sometimes of the filthy scrap- 
ings of ragpickers bleached white with arsenic. What a 
thing for human lungs! 

The habit burns up good health, good resolutions, good 
manners, good, memories, good faculties, and often hon- 
esty and truthfulness as well. 

Cases of epilepsy, insanity and death are frequently re- 
ported as the result of smoking cigarettes, while such 
physicians as Dr. Lewis Sayre, Dr. Hammond, and Sir 
Morell Mackenzie of England, name heart trouble, blind- 
ness, cancer and other diseases as occasioned by it. '

cigarette smoking as "one of the vilest and most destruct-

HOME LESSONS IN MASSAGE. 

1. Standard ot Qualiflcation. — The standard of qualifi- 
cation for the practice of massage may be thus defineu: 

First. — Good physique and good heaUh absolutely 
essential. 

Second. — Cleanliness in every particular is of the great- 
est importance. 

Third. — An intelligent interest in the patient's welfare. 

Fourth. — Perfect devotion and zeal in carrying out fully 
and carefully the duties of the work to the minutest detail, 
so as to ensure the confidence of the patient. 

Fifth. — Good temper and forbearance are necessary. 

Sixth, — Absence of fuss and undue haste. 

Seventh. — Intelligence and even refinement are advan- 
tageous. 

Eighth. — A happy, cheerful disposition, with vivacity 
and dexterity, readiness and ability, not forgetting a pleas- 
ant, contented face, complete the standard of individuality. 

2. The Perfect Hand for Massage Work should be 
soft, smooth, dry and Heshy, and of good normal, healthy 
temperature. You will find that every part of the hand 
must be made available, and there is no position which 
the hands and fingers can assume which cannot be 
adapted to some form of massage. 

8. The Room Temperature. — The room should be of 
comfortable temperature, say from 62 to 65 degrees F. 
The couch or bed upon which the patient is placed 
should not be too soft or yielding. As little as possible of

MASSAGE OF THE BACK FOR RHPiiiif iTrew i».o». 

I. Stroking with both hands, one 
on each side of the spinal column 
from the base of the skull down to 
the sacrum. If on a large person the 
operator haa better divide the back 
nto three parts, in such a manner as 
to first work next to the spinal column. 
then over the center of t'he back, and 
ihl^ tl^^ ^'^^ sides, remembering 
that by the last manipulation he maf

If desirable, m certain cases. In the 
case of an infant, and especially in 
infantile paralysis, we often use. in the 
stroking, only the index and the mid- 
die fingers, one on each side of the 
spinal column. 

2. Make a closed hand or fist, and 
compare he ormcr with the latter. 
and observe the difference in the efl 
tccts of each when applied to the 
body. You will soon discover that

of this form of 
manipulation.

4. All your movements must be done rhythmically, quiet 
and regularly at hrst. When, however, you find that they 
are unattended with any discomfort to your patient, they 
may be carried out with considerable rapidity. But under 
no condition is it justifiable to perform abdominal massage 
m a hurried arid jerking manner. 

You now effleurage over the abdominal wall, and re- 

member that all your move- 
ments should be in the course 
of the large bowel, from right 
to left of your patient, upwards 
on the right and downwards 
on the left. Pick up the skin, 
areolar tissue 
and fat by the 
usual petris-

ments, begin-

. . working round 

to the left inguinal region. If you have to bring about the 
absorption fat, great rolls of fat, you must grasp it firmly in 
your hands and knead and squeeze it as though it were 
dough. 

6. Stroking with both hands from the ankle to the hip, 
the hand on the outside reaching up to the crest of the 
ilium, the thumb of the hand on the inside, with moderate 
pressure, ^oing down towards the groin. (Avoid pressure 
upon the tibia.) 

Friction with the thumb upon the outside of the leg 
from ankle to knee joint, covering principally the flexors of 
the foot.

7. A Lame Knee Joint.— I would advise vou never tn 
meddle w.th the knee joint, unless under tEdviseoU 
surgeon. If you are not careful — * 

you might do great harm. No 
other synovial sac is capable of 
such extreme distension as that 
of the knee joint. Under ordina- 
ry conditions the amount of syno- 
via in a joint is just sufficient to 
keep the parts of the joint lubri- 
cated ; but it 
sometimes 

happens that 

the knee joint 

contains over 

a pint of fluid, 

or even more, 

and pressure 

of some kind 

from u ithout 

is frequently necessary to brine 

out Its absorption. I have to 

tell you how you are to manip- 
ulate to exercise this pressure 

to bring about absorption.

parts castor oil and chloroform ; place one hand firmly six 

mches above the knee, and the other six inches below it. 

With a fairly strong grip you advance the one hand down- 
wards, and the other hand upwards to 
within about four inches of each other, 
^and you will now be exercising pressure 
^upon the outskirts of the swelling. Don't 
<^relax your hold of the parts, but carry 
vour hands bilaterally, that is to say, one 
hand will now be on the outer side of the 
swelling, whilst the other is upon the 
inner side. You then press equally upon 
the swelling with both nands,using press- 
ure and counter-pressure; continue these 
gliding and pressure movements for ten 
or fifteen minutes. Of course, you must 
exercise pressure in direct ratio with the 
pain and sensibility of the part ; if there 
DC little or no pain, such as you find in 
_ bursal swellings, then your movements 

Curing aLeg with an may be active ; but if there be pain, then 
uloo'- your movements must be slowly, steadiy 

and carefully conducted.

Pinohing the Arm to 
Improve Circulation. 



9. For Cramps and General Lameness.— Kneading with 
the thumb and fingers, which manipulation is called pinch- 
ing, is also used to reach individual muscles, but is preferred 
on a deep-seated tissue. Kneading with both hands, called 
squeezing, is used upon the lower extremities and upon the 
arm proper for adults. The aim of the manipulation knead- 
ing is to reach the separate muscles with a firm double 
pressure and expose them to an action similar to that of 
friction.

11. Be careful not to allow the patient to smell the 
cooking of food or anything else. 

12. Do not take sewing into the room, or fuss around 
the room. Whatever is to be done, do it promptly. 

13. Be kind, be cheerful, be careful and do just as the

HAND STRAPS FOR THE SICK, 

HOW THE SICK MAY HELP THEMSELVES. 

Put up iron screen sockets so stoutly that there can be 
no danger of giving way, and fasten half-inch rope to 
them and at the end of the rope put hand pieces of soft 
cloth or webbing. Set the sockets firmly in the wall about 
three feet apart, so as to give room for all possible move- 
ment. 

It is wonderful how a very sick person can move him- 
self by taking hold of the hand straps. It is generally 
much better than could be done by the most skillful nurse, 
and creates less pain and suflfering. The patient has the 
advantage of lif Jng himself to any position he may desire.

Rules for Home Nursing. 




RULES FOR HOME NURSING. 

1. The nurse at home need not learn anything which 
win not be necessary for every woman to know or prac- 
tice in her family at some time in her life. Remember 
nursing the sick must be mastered by careful study and 
attention It cannot be mastered in a few careless and 
occasional observations. 

2. Good, intelligent nursing has often more to do with 
tne patient s recovery than the medicine. Reading to 
patients (when they are not too sick) in a low, kind and 
gentle tone will often withdraw their minds from their 
own ills and brighten them up wonderfully. It is often

FEEDING THE SICK. 

Tririal Matters. — Matters which might seem trivial to a 
well person are often of the greatest importance to one 
who is confined to his bed with sickness. A careless or 
wilful neglect of such details on the part of the nurse may 
cause what little appetite the patient has to disappear, 
while on the other hand, a careful observance of them may 
encourage a capricious desire for food into becoming a 
genuine and pleasurable appetite. 

Bathing.— Before offering the sick person food his face 
and hands should be bathed. 

Punctuality and regularity should be as strictly ob- 
served in serving the invalid's meals as in giving him med- 
icine. 

Quantity.— The proper quantity of food to ofifer the sick 
and the extent; of its dilution are matters requiring nice 
observation and care. Milk, gruels, beef tea and stimu- 
lants should not be diluted to the extent of making the 
quantity of the fluid so great that the patient tires of swal- 
lowing, and stops before he has obtained the required 
amount of ourishment. 

Hot Foods should be served very hot, and cold articles 
very cold; lukewarm food is unpalatable. In serving hot 
drinks or foods, the cups or plates should be first well 
heated. 

Untasted Food, dishes after use, or half-emptied cups and 
glasses should never be left standing about the sick room. 

Palatable.— Equally important is it to make all food 
look inviting by oflfering it with the most attractive china 
obtainable, and with only the cleanest of linen. 

Too Greasy.- Food is often made unpalatable by being 
too greasy. This is a common objection to meat broths. 
Mutton and chicken broths should always be skimmed 
several times before they are served. The last trace of 
oily substance can be removed by passing blotting-paper 
or a bit of bread over the surface. 

The Tiiexpeeted.— When the appetite flags it is unwise 
to ask the patient beforehand what he would like to eat. 
Often it is the unexpected which pler-^es. 

The Smell of Cooking and the noise of the preparationof 
food should be kept from the sick-room, if possible. The 
nurse should not taste the food in the patient's presence, 
or with his spoon, nor should she serve food with unclean 
hands. 

Patients may appear too ill to notice these details,

to have just the right degree of spicing to gently stimu- 
late; but it is even more important to avoid an excess or 
that which will do injury. Pepper should not be used, 
and there is danger in being too generous with salt. It is 
very liable to irritate, causing thirst, and gastric disturb- 
ance may be aggravated by it. 

A Nutritive Diet.— Following protracted illness, a nu- 
tritive and gently stimulative diet should be taken. This 
may properly include albuminous and nearly all mucilagi- 
nous substances, fish, game, beef, mutton, poultry (young), 
«ggs, peas, asparagus, baked potatoes, etc., with a proper 
proportion of cooked fruits as an ofTset. 

Fruit.— Apples, sweet ones preferred, baked with an un- 
broken skm, are excellent. Add no more sugar than just 
enough to make the fruit palatable. Oranges are excellent 
eaten at the begmning of a meal, especially in the morning. 

Hot Milk.— Hot milk is regarded as one of the very best 
stimulants. It must not be boiled, which renders it con- 
stipating, but heated as hot as it can be comfortably taken, 
and should be sipped with a spoon, not drank; it is more 
digestible if taken slowly. 

Arrowroot.— Arrowroot is a reliable food for the sick 
room, and many can eat it when little else that is available 
can be taken. One good way to prepare it is to take a 
teaspoonful of the powdered arrowroot, moisten it with a 
tablespoonful of cold water, rub it smooth and add a table- 
spoonful of warm water, then pour on boiling water and 
stir till transparent. Sweeten slightly, and add a little nut- 
meg and other flavoring if desired. Another way, and by 
some preferred, is to boil half a pint of milk, mix two 
teaspoonfuls of arrowroot with a little cold milk, and 
gradually add it to the boiling milk, stirring it carefully 
so that thero may be no lumps. A little sugar or salt 
should be added, but care must be taken not to overflavor. 
Use only the best arrowroot, as there are inferior kinds in 
the market. 

Gleansln? the Mouth.— One of the first concerns of a 
nurse should be to see that the patient's mouth is kept 
clean and sweet. This can be done by having the mouth 
rinsed with pure water or diluted listerine— two teaspoon- 
fuls to a tumbler of water— after each taking of food. If 
the patient is unable to do this for himself, the attendant 
should do it for him, with a swab of fresh absorbent cot- 
ton, moistened with the mouth-wash, and fastened to a 
small, flexible stick.

The Care and Feeding of Infants. 

I The Great Mortality of Infants.— The great mortality' 
of infants is now no longer attributed so much to hand-feed- 
ing as to the injudicious manner in which it is generally 
conducted. Infants die more on account of ignorance of 
parents than quality of food. 

2. The Wasting Diseases of Infants and Children.— One 

of the highest authorities on the treatment of infants says: 
"There is another class of cases where nutrition is equally 
unsatisfactory, although the supply of food is liberal enougH. 
These cases occur where weaning is premature, or where 
the child has been brought up by hand and the kind of food 
chosen to replace the natural nourishment is injudiciously 
selected, so that the limited digestive power of the child is 
unable to convert it into material necessary for growth and 
development. Here the diet substituted for the mother's 
milk, although nutritious enough in itself, yet supplies little 
nutriment to the infant. 

Deilcieiit Degree of Nutrition.- Weakness in a chila 
lerwise healthy, shows a deficient degree of nutri- 
tion, and therefore calls for an increased supply of nourish- 
ment, yet at the same time calls for increased care in the 
selection of the kind of food. There is a difference between 
food and nourishment. The very fact that the secretion of 
saliva in the young child does not become established until 
the third month after birth seems to indicate that before 
that age starchy foods are unsuited to the infant, as saliva is 
one of the most important agents in the digestion of starchy 
foods. 

4. €o^'s Milk and Condensed Milk.— Cow's milk and 
condensed milk, although diluted, are also improper food for 
infants when used alone. To quote from Dr. Routh, "Cow's 
milk, except the animal has been fed exclusively upon grass, 
is almost always acid in stall-fed cows; human milk is al- 
ways alkaline; nence, another reason why cow's milk disa« 
grees with many children." 

5. Not Free From Danger.— Even those children who 
are fed entirely upon cow's milk are not free from danger. 
Cow's milk contains a larger quantity of solid matter than a 
woman's milk, owing principally to an increase in the 
amount of caseine (cheese.) 

Children are, no doubt, frequently found to thrive upon 
this diet, their digestive power being equal to the demand?, 
made upon it. Others, however, and by far the largest prty

portion, arc not equal to this daily call upon their powers. 
They cannot assimilate this mass of curd. Consequently, 
unless rejeclcd by voniitinj;. it passes through them undi- 
pestcd; tluir wants arc not supplied and they starve for 
lack oi noiiiisliment, altlioujjh swallowing every day aquan- 
tity of milk which would be ample support for a much 
stronger and healthier infant. Such children are exceed- 
ingly restless and irritable. 

6. Stools Should Ho ('arefnlly Examined.— In all cases 
whore the food of an infant is found to be insufficient or un- 
satisfactory the stools should be carefully examined, and if, 
as is so frequently the case, they are found to consist of 
pale, round, hard lumps, showing a cheesy appearance, the 
necessary precautions in providing the child with a diet he 
is capable of digesting should at once be seriously con- 
sidered. 

7. Difference Between Cow's Mills and Woman's Milk. 

— A more important difference is the denseness of the clot 
formed by the curd of cow's milk. Ample dilution with water 
does not affect this property. Under the action of the gas 
trie juice the particles of caseine still run together into a 
solid compact lump. This is not the case with milk 
from the breast. Human milk forms a light, loose clot, 
which is readily disintegrated and digested m the stomach. 
The difficulty which even the strongest children find in 
digesting cow's railk is shown by the masses of hard curd 
which a child fed exclusively on this diet passes daily from 
the bowels. The difference between the milks is answer- 
able for much of the trouble and disappointment experi- 
enced in bringing up infants by hand; and unless measures 
are adopted to hinder the firm clotting of the caseine, 
serious dangers may arise. 

8. Sngrar Most Be Increased.— In order, then, that cow's 
milk in chemical composition and physical properties, may 
therefore be fit for an infant's use, the proportion of sugar 
must be increased, the proportion of caserne must be re^ 
duced and made easily digestible, and it must be rendered 
alkaline. 

9. Artificial Food.— Many different kinds of artificial 
food have been patented, but no doubt Mellin's Food is 
among the best now in use. 

10 Sterilized Milli.— In using cows milk it should al- 
ways be sterilized even if some Mellin's Food or other 
preparations are mixed into it. See other portions of the 
book.

acute diseases of children, or when the eruption is sup- 
pressed in eruptive diseases. 

Sjrmptonis.— In case of convulsions of a child parents 
usually become frightened, and very rarely do the things 
that should be done in order to afford relief. The child, 
previous to the fit, is usually irritable, and the twitching of 
the muscles of the face may be noticed, or it may come on 
suddenly without warning. The child becomes insensible, 
clenches its hands tightly, lips turn blue, and the eyes be- 
come fixed, usually frothing from the mouth with head 
turned back. The convulsion generally lasts two or three 
minutes ; sometimes, however, as long as ten or fifteen 
minutes, but rarely. 

Remedy.— Give the child a warm bath and rub gently, 
Clothes wrung out of cold waterand applied to the lower and 
back part of the head and plenty of fresh air will usually 
relieve the convulsion. Be sure and loosen the clothing 
around the child's neck. After the convulsion is over, give 
the child a few doses of potassic bromide, and an injection 
pf castol* oil if the abdomen is swollen. Potassic 
bromide should be kept in the house, to use in case of 
necessity.

How to Keep a Bacy Well. 



with the milk diet, some such nourishment as broth, gruel, 
egg, or some prepared food. 

8. A child should never be allowed to come to the 
table until two years of age. 

9. A child should never eat much starchy food until four 
years old. 

ID. A child should have all the water it desires to drink, 
but it is decidedly the best to boil the water first, and allow 
it to cool. All the impurities and disease germs are 
thereby destroyed. This one thing alone will add greatly 
to the health and vigor of the child. 

11. Where there is a tendency to bowel disorder, a little 
gum arable, rice, or barley may be boiled with the drink- 
ing water. 

12. If the child uses a bottle it should be kept absolutely 
clean. It is best to have two or three bottles, so that one 
will always be perfectly clean and fresh. 

13. The ripple should be of black or pure rubber, and 
not of the white or vulcanized rubber. It should fit over 
the top of the bottle, no tubes should ever be used. It is 
impossible to keep them clean. 

14. When the rubber becomes coated, a little coarse salt 
will clean it. 

15. Babies should be fed at regular times. They should 
also be put to sleep at regular hours. Regularity is one 
of the best safeguards to health. 

16. Milk for babies and children should be from healthy 
cows. Milk from different cows varies. Some authori- 
ties insist that it is better for a child to have milk from 
the same cow, while others prefer mixed milk from a herd, 
as less liable to changes. 

17. Many of the prepared foo<is advertised for children 
are of little benefit. A few may be good, but what is good 
for one child may not be for another. So it must be sim- 
ply a' matter of experiment if any of the advertised foods 
are used. 

18. It is a physiological fact that an infant is always 
healthier and better to sleep alone. It gets better air and 
is not liable to suffocation. 

19. A healthy child should never be fed oftener than 
once in two hours, gradually lengthening the time as it 
grows older; at 4 months 31/^ or 4 hours. At 5 months a 
healthy child will be better if piven nothing in the night. 

20. G've an infant a little water several times a day. 

21. For colds, coughs, croup, etc., use goose oil exter- 
nally and give a teaspoonful at bed-time.

articles take the place of good roast meat. A child's sense 
ot hunger is a sharp reality and he -oon becomes faint with 
It. Children grow more between twelve and seventeen than 
they do m all the years of life that follow. It is in this time 
that bone and muscle, nerve and energy are to be manufac- 
tured and stored up against middle life, the time when thev 
will begin to need them. ' 

Appetite.— Do I not know how absolutely insatiable a 
boy s appetite can be ? He will devour a hearty dinner of 
roast beef, mutton or veal, vegetables and pudding at twelve 

clock, and be iar gone in the pangs of starvation before 
five. 

Sleep.— But it is not only in regard to food that parents 
are negligent. Sleep, which gives clearness to the eye and 
buoyancy lo the step, and makes walking in the open air a 
\oy and ever-increasing delight— Sleep is ruined or spoiled 
in a dozen different ways. Children's parties and evening 
entertainment's are the means used to rob many children of 
their growth and vitality. While children are in school they 
have no business with "social life." School work and the 
necessary daily exercise in the fresh air and sunshine are 
as much as should be permitted. Between these and their 
growth they are sufficiently taxed. All children should go 
to bed early, comfortable, easv in mind, in a well-ventilated 
room, and should be allowea to sleep until they waken of 
their o^vn accord. If they sleep at all they will not fail to 
waken just as soon as it is good for them. And if they don't 
sleep? Then they are on the sure road to a fit of indiges- 
tion or brain disease. 

Goin^ to School.— Many children enter the schoolroom 
at nine o'clock day after day looking wan and heavy-eyed. 

1 shudder at the ill-health they are storing up for the future. 
It is sad and strange to see how easily mothers, often good 
niothers too, in other respects, shut their eyes to the begin- 
ning of this evil in those dearer to them than their own life 
— their children. 

Cause of Premature Decay.— The children now stand- 
ing on the threshold ot manhood and womanhood sink into 
premature decay and fall by the wayside at an age when 
strength and ability should enable them to withstand pro- 
longed effort in the schoolroom— and all for want of proper 
systematic attention to health. Parents must put a stop to 
the causes which excite ill-health, and not rush to the doc- 
tor to cure their children. All the medicine in the world 
cannot counteract the effect of foolish, persistent neglect 
and continued indulgence.

Bottle Feeding. 



\ 



M?:,,.^.^i'5^®^^"f,^'?P'*'-~^'"- ^- Thornton Parker, of 
Newport, Rhode Island, recommends a pure gum nipnle 
. with two ho es as far apart as possible, as the best for the 
nursing bottle, and also says regarding the matter as fol- 
lows; "When there js only one hole, tlie infant in nursing 
conipresses the nipple and sends the milk in a stream in 
such a manner as often to nearly strangle itself. Milk com- 
ing through one hole is not as comfortable as when it comes 
through two. and the effort of nursing becomes disagreeable 
and wearisome to the little feeder. The best wav to nursC 
an infant is by holding at in the arms, and give it the bottle 
m the same position and height a3 if it were really nursed bv 
Its mother When it has hnished nursing, the bottle should 
be removed, emptied and cleansed. Never should the bot- 
tle be left in the infant's care to use at will." 

7. A Mixture Resembling Motlier's Miik.-The milk 
from an ordinary dairy shouldbc obtained as fresh as pos- 
sible, mix tbgethcr half a pint of this milk and half a pint of 
pure water, and to this should be added about two hundred 
grains or two heaping teaspoonfuls of milk sugar, with four 
grains of soda; it should then be brought to a boil, after 
which two tablespoonfuls of cream should be stirred in and 
It is ready for use, to be given by bottle or drinking cup, at 
about the body temperature. s p. 11-

5. Ncvtf) .el .liiKiiTn younger than fifteen years of ape 
wear stays of any kind. During childliood tlic bones yield 
easily to pressure, and very many injuries and deformities 
have their beginning by bad methods of dress, and all 
forms of artificial bandages, corsets, garters, waist strings 
or an excess of weiglit hanging from the hips, should be 
avoided. All garments made for children should hang 
from the shoulders. 

6. Children who play out-of-doors in cool and damp 
weather should wear good heavy shoes, with thick soles. 
7- It IS an excellent practice for families to secure r 
good text-book on gymnastic or calisthenic exercise and 
when children are five years of age to begin and give them 
a regular systematic training every day. This will de- 
velop their pniscular strength, give grace to their figures 
and gestures, develop their lungs, and strengthen the 
constitution in general. Both girls and bovs should be 
trained by taking regular physical exercise daily, or taught 
to perform some daily task, which will ansv.- the same 
purpose. 

8. Indulge children in all kinds of out-door games, cro- 
quet, lawn tennis, etc., and your children will enjoy hap- 
piness and health. 

9- Be sure to give children plenty of sleep. They should 
retire early and not be disturbed in the morning, but be 
permitted to enjoy their full desire of sleep. 

10. Children should never drink coiYee, tea, cocoa, or 
chocolate, for it will make the skin thick and yellow and 
often produce other serious disorders. Milk and water 
should be the only drink of children. 

11. Little girls playing out-of-doors should have their 
faces protected, as they are liable to become freckled 
and freckles are sometimes very difficult to remove They 
should w^ear good large sun-bonnets or broad-brimmed 
hats.

AN AILING CHILD. 

Fresh Air.— An ailing child should be kept in a pure 

atmosphere and have fresh air to breatiio. Tliis does not 
mean that the windows must bo thrown wide open and the 
httle body chilled with draughts. The temperature of a 
nursery should never fall below sixty-five degrees, and in 
illness be kept at from sixty-eight to seventy degrees. Fresh 
air must be admitted and enough artificial heat supplied 
to keep the temperature uniform. Of course, in extreme- 
ly cold weather the window must be closed and the room 
aired when the child is asleep. At this time it can be cov- 
ered from head to foot with a blanket, the face protected 
and the window opened for a few minutes. The extra 
covermg must be left on until the thermometer again reg- 
isters sixty-eight degrees. In ordinarily mild weather the 
window can be lowered from the top about two inches 
and a strip of flannel tacked over the opening to prevent 
a draught. If the window does not open at the top a 
piece of board two inches wide and exactly fitting the win- 
dow frame can be put under the lower sash. The child 
should be kept away from the window. 

Warm Rath. — A warm bath is always grateful to a sick 
child. The water should fully cover the person and feel 
pleasantly warm to the hand. As the little patient is lifted 
out wrap it in a warm blanket and dry it under that with 
a warm towel. Put on a flannel night-dress, or jacket, 
oyer the cotton night-gown. If the attack is the begin- 
ning of an eruptive disease, the bath will help to bring 
the eruption to the surface. An ailing child should not be 
allowed to sleep in the room with other children. 

First Symptoms.— If parents would watch for the first 
symptoms of illness in their children and take things in 
time, they might often save themselves from great anxiety, 
and doctor's bill, and their little ones from pain and suf- 
^nng. Nearly every ailment proceeds at first from a cold. 
Sometimes a child droops and seems heavy and languid 
for days, going to school unwillingly and dropping asleep 
oyer lessons. At such times, instead of chiding and spur- 
nng the weary one on to exertion, it would be far better 
to give the child a vacation a few days. 

Honor at Expense of Vigor.— Never mind whether your 
little boy or girl stands first on the roll of honor or not. 
See to it that no honors or rewards are gained at the ex- 
pense of vigor and health. Never slight the beginnings 
of a cold. From six to ten drops of turpentine will gen-

334 , Diseases of Infants and Children. 

COLIC. 

1. Babies often suffer severely with colic. It is not 
considered dangerous/ but causes considerable suffering. 

2. Severe colic is usually the result of derangement of 
the liver in the mother, or of her insufficient or improper 
nourishment, and it occurs more frequently when the 
child is from two to five months old. 

3- Let the mother eat chiefly barley, wheat and bread, 
rolled wheat, graham bread, fish, milk, eggs and fruit 
The latter may be freely eaten, avoiding that which is 
very sour. 

4- A rubber bag or bottle filled with hot water put into 
a crib will keep the child, once quieted, asleep tor hours. 
If a child is ^suffering from colic it should be thoroughly 
warmed and kept warm. 

5. Avoid giving opiates of any kind, such as cordials, 
Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup, "Mothers' Friend," and 
various other patent medicines. They injure the stomach 
and health of the child instead of benefiting it. 

6. Remedies. —A few tablespoonfuls of hot water will 
often allay a severe attack of the colic. Catnip tea is 
also a good remedy. 

A drop of essence of peppermint in 6 or 7 teaspoonfuls 
of hot water will give relief. 

If the stools are green and the child is very restless, 
give chamomilla. 

If the child is suffering from constipation and undi- 
gested curds of milk appear in its faeces, and the child 
starts suddenly in its sleep, give nux vomica. 

An injection of a few spoonfuls of hot water into the 
rectum with a little asafoetida is an effective remedy and 
will be good for an adult,

powdered alum. The syrup of squills is an old and tried 
remedy; give m 15 to 30 drop doses and repeat every 10 
minutes till vomiting occurs. Seek out the cause, if pos- 
sible, and remove it. It commonly lies in some deranee- 
ment of the digestive organs. 

TRUE CROUP. 

Definition.— This disease consists of an inflammation of 
the mucous membrane of the upper air passages, particu- 
arly of the larynx, with the formation of a false mem- 
brane that obstructs the breathing. The disease is most 
common in children between the ages of two and seven 
years, but it may occur at any age. 

Symptoms.— Usually there are symptom^ of a cold for 
three or four days previous to the attack. Marked hoarse- 
ness IS observed in the evening, with a ringing metallic 
cough and some difihculty in breathing, which increases 
and becomes somewhat paroxysms! till the face, which 
was at first flushed, becomes pallid and ashy in hue. The 
ettorts at breathing become very great, and unless the 
child gets speedy relief it will die of sufifocation. 

Home Treatment.— Patient should be kept in a moist 
warm atmosphere, and cold water applied to the neck 
ear^y in the attack. As soon as the breathing seems diffi- 
cult give a half to one teaspoonful of powdered alum in 
honey to produce vomiting and apply the remedies sug- 
gested in the treatment of diphtheria, as the two diseases 
are thought by many to be identical. When the breath- 
ing becomes labored and face becomes pallid, the condi- 
tion IS very serious and a physician should be called with- 
out delay. 

Powdered Alum.— Powdered alum and sugar is an ex- 
cellent remedy for croup, or for colds when the throat 
seems to be filled up. But sometimes the attack of croup 
comes on and there is no powdered alum in the house. 

Kerosene. -In such cases take a spoonful of sugar, put 
a few drops of kerosene on it and give that. Repeat the 
dose until a teaspoonful of kerosene has been taken in- 
ternally. Also rub the throat and chest with a little kero- 
sene, then cover it with cotton batting. When there is a 
troublesome, dry cough, salt taken dry on the ongue 
m small quantities, will relieve the majority of cases '

CONSTIPATION. 

1. This i« a very frequent ailment of infants. The 
thing necessary is for the mother to regulate her diet. 

2. If the child is nursed regularly arni held out at the 
same time of each day, it will seldom be troubled with this 
complaint. Give plenty of water. Regularity of habit is 
the best remedy. If this method fails, use a soap sup- 
pository. Make it by paring a piece of white castile soap 
round. It should be made about the size of a lead pencil 
pointed at the end. ' 

3. Avoid giving a baby drugs. Let the physician ad- 
minister them if necessary. 

4. An unsuitable diet quickly causes irregularity of the 
bowels in children. 

5. Cream and butter are to be recommended on porridge 
and cornmeal. Oatmeal gruels should be use by older 
children, who should also be encouraged to drink as 
much water as they crave. For children three years and 
older, stewed prunes, orange juice, honey and bread, 
ohve oil and olives, peaches, fresh vegetables and baked 
apples and ginger bread should form part of bill of fare, 
and there will be no need of castor oil, rhubarb, etc' 
often an injury to the child. ' 

CHEERFULNESS AND HEALTH. 

It is known that intense anger, or great grief or fright, 
may so poison the milk of a nursing mother that her 
child is killed by taking that milk into its stomach. 

Professor Elmer Gates, recently lecturing before the 
Smithsonian Institution at Washington, has isolated this 
poison, and is able to exhibit it in crystals. He has 
also shown that hateful and unpleasant feelings cause the 
formation of poisons in the body which are physically 
injurious to it; that benevolent and happy sensations 
lead to the creation of beneficial chemical products in 
the blood and tissues. 

All of these can be detected by chemical analysis in 
the urine and the perspiration. 

DIPHTHERIA AND SCARLET FEVER. 

A prominent physician claims that there will be no 
diphtheria, scarlet fever nor worms for children if they 
eat plentifully of onions every day, especially when there 
IS a scarcity of fresh fruit. He buys the onions by the 
barrel for his young folks, and they are served in every 
imaginable form.

as much as possible. A strong tea made of the tops of red 
clover ,s highly recommended. A strong tea made of 
chestnut leaves, sweetened with sugar, is also verTgood 

1 teaspoonful of powdered alum. 
I teaspoonful of syrup. 

Mix in a tumbler of water, and give the child one tea-

have a constant supply of fresh air. 

Woolen undergarments should be worn day and night 
while daily bathing should be carefully practiced. Coun- 
ter-irritation of a mild character over the region of the 
stomach is of great value, and the diet should be of the 
simplest and most nourishing kind. 

Vapors and inhalants rarely do good, but frequently 
the patient improves after their discontinuance.

DIARRHEA. 

Great care should be exercised by parents in checking 
tlic diarrhea of chil.ircMi. Many times serious diseases are 
l^roiiKlit on by iMiciits bciiiK too hasty in checking this 
disorder of the bowels. It is an infant's first method of 
removing obstructions and overcoming derangements 
of the sy&tcm. 

SUMMER COMPLAINT. 

1. Summer complaint is an irritation and inflammation 
ot the hning nicml)ranes of the intestines. This may 
often be caused by teething, eating indigestible food, etc. 

2. If the discharges are only frequent and yellow and 
not accompanied with pain, there is no cause for anxiety 
but if the discharges arc gr."cn, soon becoming gray' 
brown and sometimes frothy, having a mixture of phlegm' 
and sometimes containing food undigested, a physician 
had better be summoned 

3- /"the first stages give a tablespoonful at bedtime of 
the following prescription: 

2 oz. castor oil. 

2 oz. aromatic syrup of rhubarb. 

1. This is one of the best of domestic remedies, and 
should always be kept on hand. Whenever the stomach 
of children is out of order, a dose of this simple remedy 
often works magic. 

2. Keep the child perfectly quiet and the room well 
aired. 

3- Put a drop of tincture of camphor on a teaspoonful 
of sugar, mix thorougliiy; then add six tcaspoonfuls of hot 
water and give a teaspoonful of the mixture every ten 
minutes. This is indicated where the discharges are 
watery, and where there is vomiting and coldness of the 
feet and hands. Chamomilla is also an excellent remedy. 

4. Drink freely of boiled milk, and in bad cases drink no 
water except that which has been boiled and cooled. 

FOR TEETHINO. 

If a child is suffering with swollen gums, is feverish, 
restless, and starts in sleep, give nux vomica.

Beauty, 









BEAUTY. 

thif ?® beautifulin the real sense means something more 
than to have facial perfections. The real beauty should 
start from withm and make itself felt with every move- 
ment and expression of the body. 

Desirable.- Beauty of face and person is desirable, 
praiseworthy, and attainable by all of us. Nay it is our 
imperative ^uty to be as beautiful, as exquisite, ac divinely 
attractive in soul, body, and mind as we pcssibly can S 

fi^M^;.. '^"*^ Jf ^ ^^'y '^""^^ ^^'•d' a"d covers a broad 
M«v i/pLl''^"^ understopd by the masses of people. 
May be Permanent.-It is the desire to excel fn all 

S V \^°°.'. «f^.**' ^"^ "oble. It is the striving after 

tl^?^?' 'i?'^^ ? ^^^' '^'•"^ ''^^"'y '^ permanent! wife 
the merely physical attractions fade with our years, becom- 
ing withered imd seamed by the flight of time. 

rremature Age.- Have you ever noticed the premature 
age that comes with fretful, dissatisfied natures ; that ac- 
companies a disappointed ambition; that feels they have 
not been appreciated by the world? And consequently 
they are cynical, hard, and repellent. 4"c«"y 

Yoor Standard.--Let me say to such as these, do not 
t^^TI'A^? "°* fee .discouraged, do not let others set a 
standard for your life, but establish your own ideals of 
to S ^°°^"^^^' ''"^ 'beauty, and then work upward 

mIvo ^w"®' Self.-Recpgnize yourself, your inner self. 
Make that as near perfection as you can, and the outward 
will soon grew to correspond with the inner nature, un- 
til youth and beauty will become self-renewing and blos- 
som like the bellflower-as you grow physically down 
itually ' ^°" ^'''^"*^ mentally, morally, and spir- 

Good AdTlce.-Somebody asked an old lady, whose 
face IS still sweet and rosy at 80, how to be beautiful. Her 
advice was: "Try a little spiritual exercise. Look af 
yourself in the mirror four or five times a day. If the 
corners of your mouth are down and you are an unhappy 
looking creature, elevate your expression. Think of the 

?Mnt^2^? *^'"^ ^^^} ^""^J happened to you; the kindest 
thing that was ever done for you; send out the most gen- 
erous, sweetesi. most helpful thoughts to your friends,

corner from mahce; the eyes grow small by the lids 
coming together when one is possessed of a cunninc 
curiosity; the chm doubles itself from gluttony, and thi 
cheeks mcline to fold over when one allows one's self to 
grow cross and to speak with shrill, high notes. 

Loud Speakln?.-The strain that results from speaking 
loudly causes the muscles of the throat to over-develop 
and make it look stringy and unfeminine. 

Temper.— So, first of all, she who would be charmine 
must remember that the woman who allows her temper 
to control her will not retain one single physical charm 
It IS said that gluttony and angv will deform a face. 

Greatest Charm.-The greatest charm and the something 
which we feel and yet cannot explain, is what is best 
described as beauty of expression. This delights the 
eye, but it. cannot exist where there are low, sordid fe-l- 
ings, and where encouragement is not given to everythintr 
that is high and noble, pure and womanly. After one hal 
cultivated these virtues and made them one's own, then it 
is necessary to study the physical side of life. 

Laws of Life. — Fortunately you are starting out in 
lite with no inherited disease, and with everything in your 
favor, therefore what remains for you to do is to learn 
the laws of life, and to live up to them. The treatment 
you give your body shows, and so you must take special 
care of the casket holding that jewel, your soul. 

TO ACQUIRE A BEAUTIFUL FORM. 

Dr. Jacques says, " Take abundant exercise in the ope^ 
an— free, attractive, joyous exercise, such as young girl 
when not restrained by false and artificial proprieties, are 
wont to take. If you are in the country, or can get 
there, ramble over the hills and through the woodlands- 
botanize; geologize; seek rare flowers and plants; hunt 
bird nests, and chase butterflies. Be a romp, even though 
you may be no longer a little girl. If you are a wife 
a"a a mother, so much the better. Romp with your 
children. Attend also to your bodily position in stand- 
mg, sitting, lying and walking, and employ such general 
or special gymnastics as your case may require. Live 
while indoors, in well-ventilated rooms; take sufficient 
wholesome and nourishing food, at regular hours; keep 
f h "^lUf ..^'^''^^ *"*^ cheerful— in short, obey all the laws

Cosmetics.- Young lady, do not deceive yourself. You 
cannot use cosmetics without the knowledge of your gen- 
lemen friends. They will respect you the more if you 
forever abandon the use of such subterfuges. ^ 

Vegretables Better than Cosmetics—Ladies all who wish 
clear complexions, instead of using cosmetics, eat vSe- 
ables and fruit, as long as they are in season; and ne?er 
throw away cucumber water or the juice o any frtlft 
but rub your face with it whenever you have it

^1:1 ^. ''1?'"^ ^°'"^ ^° '^^^^ '^'^'^'-^e who acquii c this 
habrt when they are young will iKjf regret it in old age. 
Mothers should personally see tl-at their children clean 
their teeth thoroughly a.j.: reguinr'y. Children do s^ot 
realize the importance of such practice and are Mable to 
shirk duty and slight the operation. 

How?— 1 here are very t^w people who knoW how to 
clean teeth properly and easily. Just lor.k . < them as 
they swrKg the brush from dde to side a.: ridit anR*>^3 
with lb ;n perpendicular plane. The proper ..vay to brush 
and cle -.n. (he 'cefn is to brush from the gums downward 
for the upper teeth, and from the gums upward, for the 
inferior or lo-^tt ic-edi. By this method the bristles go be- 
tween the t:c.h, touching their approximating? surfaces, 
as we.l as c'.eaning (he front and sides of the teeth 

it IS tjot less important to brush downward on the pala- 
tine-roof surface of the upper teeth, and upward on the 
hngual-tongue side of the lower teeth, that is to say 
brush the mside of the teeth more carefully, if anything 
than the outside. Do not brush and clean the teeth for 
the sole purpose of making thsm look bright, clean and 
pretty, but to keep foreign substances from producing 
caries, or plainer still, .- ing holes into the teeth and ex- 
posing a highly sensitive cissue, the pulp or nerve. Clean 
the grinding surfaces of the teeth with the same interested 
care. 

, Women in general are supposed to be greatly interested 
m the preservation of their teeth, and it may be somewhat 
painful to them for me to inform them that they do not gen- 
erally possess as strong and dense teeth as do the male sex. 
Ihat is the rule, the exceptions are rare. Hence the im- 
portance of cleanlmess on their part is more important. 

Mother8.—Then, again, mothers will do well to remem- 
ber that the bones and teeth of their children are not as 
firm and compact as are these tissues in adults. There has 
not been deposited amidst the soft-solids of these textures 
as much of the carbonate and phosphate of lime as we will 
find as they grow older. Hence the value of preventing 
acid formations. ^ 

Economy.— If economy is wealth, this is one pi, / oad 

to that condition. Nay, more, while one save -tal 

bills he saves, wh^t is infinitely of more vp'ne, 1 teeth

Beantina Hands.— The first thing one should do, in 
order to - cure beautiful hands, is to see to existing blem- 
ishes, and their removal, if that be possible. 

Wurts.— As for warts, for instance, they are vt ry disfig- 
uring, and should be got rid of at Ps f^nrly an age as possi- 
ble, so that any scars left ^' ner rlisapnear. 

Remedy. — There are many simple remeaies tor warts, 
but they are not always effectual. The ordinary milk- 
wf;ed of suburban gardens may be tried. The wart is to 
be touched with the juice twice or thrice daily. 

Second.— If this does not succeed, we go a step further, 
iind try a wash like the following, which not only tends to 
banish and prevent warts, but is useful for red hands, and 
helps to do away with clamminess. It is very simp'e. 
You take about a dram and a half of sal-ammoniac and 
dissolve it in a quart uf rain-water. Add a tablespoonful 
of toilet vinegar. The hands are to be steeped in this — 
they must have been previously washed and dried — for 
about a quarter of an hour evry morning and evening. 

ThirJ.— If obdurate, the warts will want more string' nt 
treatment. There is strong acetic acid to be had at uie 
chemists, in tubes all ready. It should be used with cau- 
tion — not a drop or half drop being allowed to fall any- 
where, for it stains and burns. Touch only the wart gen- 
tly once a day, and don't let any on the whole skin. But 
the caustic silver pencil is equally effectual. 

Fonrth.— If the wart is sufficiently large, it may be re- 
moved by winding around it first a silk or silver thread, 
and after it is dried and shriveled, cauterize with a little 
nitrate of silver. 

The very "^t trea^uent, h vever, is electrolysis, and it 
is done by a t., Ivanic battery, this should be done by the 
profession who understand the business. 

Moles. — Moles may also be got rid of by acetic acid or 
even caustic s'".ci but they are more ticl lish things to 
tackle than wart!;, so surgical aid should be had. I am 
much against self-treatment where safety is jeopa. dized. 

Superflaons Uairsare disfigur'- ,. They canberemo; ed 
by the ordinary depilator es oi shops; but these often 
contain arsenic; they ar- us dangerous. Besides, they 
are dear; and one does al lys like to ask for such 

things. I think the folic ig . nlatory as good and safe 
as any. It is simply a strong solution of suh^huret of 
barium formed into a paste with powdered starca. It is 
left on a few minutes and scraped off with the back nf a 
knife. Or here is a French recipe: Crystallized hydrosul-

The Hands. 



«hnnMKl ? "^ Hands. -To begin with, they 
should be kept ery clean. But I do not advise you to be 
perpetually scouring your hands, nor using t.uf roM^h a 
towel. Ihe use of sandsoap or pumice-.stone is hiBhly 
objectionable. Always use the mildest non-alkaline soap 
there are many good ones in the market, but do noi 
trust to puffing advertisements, and never buy a cheao 
soap—cheap and nasty! Always use rain water. Keeo 
your hands gent y warm— not hot— while out of door^ 
Muffs are not always advantageous, as they sweat the 
hands. If you would avoid roughness and redness, never 
hold your hands over the fire. 

Standfn? About In Cold Rooms while in even- 
ing dress has a most injurious effect both on the com- 
plexion and hands. Always, if possible, throw a light 
soft shawl around your shoulders. The condition of skin 
raised by cold, and called "goose-skin," really means 
temporary paralysis of the cuticle, and is very detrimental 
if often repeated. 

Drinking Hot Tea or hot drinks of any kind when 
very cold is also bad for hands and face. Such drinks 

P'"°..HF^ f *°° ^^'■'y reaction, and mischief is done that 
IS difhcult to get over. 

*u^*u^**j~ A^ soft nail-brush should be used in washing 
•* u if I . .^"y instrument be needed for the nails. 
It should be of ivory, not of steel; if you use a sharp steel 
instrument you roughen the under surface, and they 
soon get unsightly, and are more easily soiled 

Trlmmlnsr. - About once a week is often enough 
to trim the nails. Do not cut them too much down at the 
sides, else you may have an ingrowing nail. Trim them 
oval or filbert, >yhich ever suits the shape of the fingers 
best. Do not, however, leave them too long, or they 
may easily be likened to claws by people who don't 
love you. 

Hot Water. -- Wash in hot water, and the skin that 
grows up over the nail may then easily be kept in its 
proper place by the ivory trimmer. 

lemon Jnlce and glycerine will clean and soften the 
hands. When putting glycerine on chapped hands first 
wash them thoroughly in soap and water, and when not 
quite dry rub in the glycerine. This process will be found 
much better than the old one. Vaseline is also splendid 
for chapped hands.

impossible to keep the hands from chapping and looking

The Structure of the Hair. 

1. The whole body, except the palms of the hands and 
the soles ot the feet, is covered with hair. The hair of the 
head m different individuals embraces a vast variety oi 
color, length and quality. 

2. Root of the Hair. — The root of the hair is made of 
two parts, sheath and bulb. The bulb is two or three times 
the diameter of the hair and is made up of cells. 

3. The Bulb is the enlargement of the root as shown in 
the above figure, and the color of the hair is developed in 
the bulb. In gray hair there is no coloring matter. Thus 
It IS seen that when the bulb becomes diseased, and the root 
of the hair dies, it must naturally fall out, just as the tree 
whose root is dead must decay and fall.

HOW TO CARE FOR THE HAIR. 



A Housekeeper's Opinion. 

Importance.— There is nothinj^r that adds so much to a 
woman's appearance as an abundance of soft, glossy hair 
and more thought and time should be spent in taking care 
of It than is usually given. Keep it free from dust by 
wearing a dusting-cap while sweeping, taking up carpets 
and simi ar work. Brushing from five to ten minutes 
every night and morning will make it glossy and stimulate 
Its gro^yth. I know of two sisters who perform this task 
for each other regularly, and I have never seen more 
beautiful hair than theirs. It is more convenient than to 
brush one s own hair, of course, but those who have no 
sister within reach, and can not afford a lady's maid, can 
usually do the work very nicely themselves. The brush 
should have long, stifif bristles that will remove the dust 
and should be kept scrupulously clean. A fine-tooth comb 
is useful for removing dandruff, which, if allowed to re- 
main, incrusts the scalp, invites disease, and causes the 
hair to turn gray or fall out. At night it should be 
braided loosely, tied with soft ribbon, and allowed to hang 
Some attention should be given the hairpins, as those 
that are rough, coarse, or sharply pointed should not be 
used. 

Washing.— The hair will need washing oner a month. 
The following method is very simple, and leaves it in ex- 
cellent condition. Use plenty of warm, soft water and 
Ivory soap to get it clean, changing the water as often 
as necessary. Rinse in clear, soft water, and wipe as dry 
as possible with a towel. Then spread it ovier the 
shoulders and sit near the fire to finish drying. A little 
vaseline appli d after it is dry keeps it from flying about 
by supplying the oil that has been removed by washing. 
At no other time is any oil or pomade necessary. 

Bleaehe8.=Preparations containing cantharides cause 
the hair to grow by stimulating the scalp to healthy action. 
Many bleaches are injurious, and have been known to 
seriously affect the brain. vVhy should any woman wish 
to change the color of her hair, which usually harmonizes 
with her features and complexion, simply because fashion 
declares in favor of blond tresses?

Dyeinff.— If you desire to oreserve your hair, carefully 
avoid all kinds of hair dye; tnere are some remedies that 
will darken the hair without injuring it, "Dut any of the 
regular hair dyes, such as are commonly used, are un- 
safe and injurious. The color nature has bestowed upon 
the human hair is more perfect and more beautiful than 
any imitations which can be produced by any system of 
dyeing. Gray locks come with age and are an adornment 
and not a disgrace. 

Gray Hairs. — Some persons are given to pulling out 
solitary gray hairs that make their appearance early. They 
could not do anything more foolish. The hair is simply 
broken oflF at the root, and the decayed nutriment escapes, 
inoculating the hair in the immediate vicinity. As a con- 
sequence, for every gray hair pulled out, five more make 
their appearance. 

There is nothing finer than gray hair on the head of one 
who is nearing the horizon of life. It is an aureole of 
glory. 

How to Make the Hair Wave.— Soft, natural-looking 
waves of hair are made by rolling the hair over large, soft 
papers or kid curlers, rolling from the top of the curl 
toward the end. The hair should be wet and left on the 
rolls oyer night. If that is not done, pinch the curls with 
a hot iron. If you wish to have the hair set out around 
the face, turn the teeth of your side combs toward the face, 
and not away from it. Catch them through the end of 
your waves, and you can fluff the hair as little or as much 
as you choose. 



HOW TO CLEAN HAIB BRUSHES. 

Put a teaspoonful or dessertspoonful of 
aqua ammonia into a basin half full of 
w-iter, comb the loose hairs out of the 
brush, then agitate the water 
briskly with the brush, and 
rinse it well with clear water. 
A few drops of hartshorn put 
into a little water will clean a 
hair brush nicely. If very 
dirty, use a little soap also.

TONICS AND OILS. 

\ye have, as has been seen, discouraged the use of 
tonics and oils and wc would repeat that it is best to avoid 
their use. Some of them are harmless, but others are 
injurious. For the benefit of those who would use them 
we give some of the best and safest recipes. 

Hair Tonic or Wash made of the following, bay rum, 
4 ounces; rain water, 4 ounces; quinine, 20 grains, is one 
of the best hair tonics and restoratives for general daily 
use made. I promotes vigor, growth, and keeps the 
hair soft and glossy. If the hair is very light, falls out 
and breaks, the quinine wash should be applied every 
night before retiring. 

Clipping,— When after an illness the hair falls out it 
should be cut short and kept clipped for at least twelve 
months. Wash the scalp regularly two or three times a 
week with the following hair tonic: 

Tinct. bloodroot, 2 drachms; tinct. lobelia, i drachm; 
ti.nct, capsicum, 2 drachms; tinct, cantharides, 2 drachms; 
glycerine, 2 ounces; alcohol, 7 ounces; bay rum, 7 ounces; 
sul. quiniv, s grains. 

Dissol ? ,( quinine in the alcohol first, and then add 
the other m)', idients. 

Ap|ii'y ,/„ ai, nt, rubbing freely into the scalp. 

This rcruj^dy has been proven to be among the best 
and can be /ifely applied under any and all circumstances 
where the hair shows signs of deadness and is falling out. 

Hair Dressing^. — In nearly every instance thorough 
brushing will keep the hair soft, tractable and glossy, but 
if it is very stubborn and you think you really must have 
a dressing i advise the use of either of the following as 
safe— the last one especially is clean and cool, and free 
from greasiness, being really a fluid neutral soap. It is 
the very best dressing for children's hair that can be used. 
Remember that any hair dressing should be used sparingly 
and well brushed in. Take of castor oil four fluid ounces, 
alcohol two fluid ounces, add any perfume you like and 
shake well; or bay rum eight ounces, glycerine two fluid 
ounces; or pure sweet oil six fluid ounces and limewater 
two fluid ounces. Shake well every time it is used. 

Hair Tonic (Baldness).— Tincture capsicum, 2 drachms; 
water ammonia (10 per cent.), i ounce; pilocarpine hydro- 
chlorate, 5 grains; cologne, 3 ounces. Use on scalp twice a 
day.

PRACTICAL HINTS FOR SHAVING. 




How to Sharpen a Razor, Keep tfie Face Smooth, Color the 

Beard, Cure Pimples, and Various Preparations 

for the Face. 

1. To Make a Good Razor Strop, take a piece of an old 
leather belt, which has been used on some threshing macliine 
or factory machinery, cut it narrow and oil it well. No better 
strop in use. 

2. Take a piece of new kip leather and oil it well with wagon 
grease. Be sure not to take the grease from tlie outside of the 
wheel, as it is filled with too much dust and dirt. 

3. No one shaving himself should neglect the use of Baij 
Bum, or a good face wash after shaving. It keeps tlie skin 
smooth and soft, and makes shaving an easy task. 

4. One of the best and cheapest washes for the face, to use 
after shaving, is the following : 

2 oz. Glycerine, 

I oz. Tincture Benzoin, 

I oz. Rose Water.

HOW TO CURE BUNIONS. 

A bunion is nothing more or less than a large corn, and 
is generally caused by wearing short, high-heeled, and nar- 
row soled shoes, which throw the weight of the body on 
the front part of the foot. 

Home Remedy.— Take a small, flat and hollow Indian 
rubber ring or band and place it over the bunion so as 
to keep off the pressure of the shoe. A cotton band may 
be used. 

When the pain is severe, it should be poulticed with a 
bread and milk poultice. 

Kerosene treatment recommended for corns is also very 
efficient. Or touch it with a little Nitrate of silver occa- 
sionally. 

ANTIDOTES FOR COLD FEET. 

Cold feet are generally the result of profuse perspiration. 
Put small quantities of pulverized alum in the stockings 
every morning. Bathe the feet every night in warm water 
and saleratus. 

Cold feet are sometimes the result of poor circulation. 
In that case the general health should be toned up.

292 Footwear, 

SOxTIE rOLMERS ABOUT FOOTWEAR, 

Dr. Samuel Appleton gives fourteen of them^ which 
every person will derive comfort in heeding: 

1. Never wear a shoe that will not allow the great 
toe to lie in a straight line. 

2. Never wear a shoe with a sole narrower than the 
outline of the foot traced with a pencil close under the 
rounding edge. 

3. Never wear a shoe that pinches the heel. 

4. Never wear a shoe or boot so large in the heel that 
the foot is not kept in place. 

5. Never wear a shoe or boot tight anywhere. 

6. Never wear a shoe or boot that has depressions in 
any part of the sole to drop any joint or bearing below 
the level plane. 

7. Never wear a shoe with a sole turning up very much 
at the toeg, as this causes the cords on the upper part 
of the foot to contract. 

8. Never wear a shoe that presses up into the hollow 
of the foot. 

9. Never have the top of the boots tight, as it in- 
terferes with the action of the calf muscles, makes one 
walk badly, and spoils the shape of the ankle. 

10. Never come from high heels to low heels at one 
jump. 

11. Never wear one pair of shoes all the time, unless 
obliged to do so. Two pairs of boots worn a day at a 
time alternately give more service and are much more 
healthful. 

12. Never wear a leather sole lining to stand upon. 
White cotton drilling or linen is much better and more 
healthful. 

13. Never wear a short stocking, or one which after 
being washed is not, at least, one-half inch longer than 
the foot. Bear in mind that stockings shrink. Be sure 
that they will allow your toes to spread out at extreme 
ends, as this keeps the joints in place and makes a 
strong and attractive foot. As to shape of stockings, 
the single digital or "one-toe stocking" is the best. 

14. Never think that the feet will grow large from 
wearing proper shoes. Pinching and distorting makes 
them grow not only large, but unsightly. A proper, 
natural use of all the muscles makes them compact and 
attractive.

duct. A high sense of rectitude, a lowly soul, with a pure 
and jkind heart, are elements of nobility which will work 
out in the life of a human being at home — everywhere. 
"Private refinement makes public gentility." 

4. If you would conciliate the favor of men, rule your 
resentment. Remember that if you permit revenge or 
malice to occupy your soul, you are ruined. 

5. Cultivate a happy temper; banish t'le blues; a cheer- 
ful, sanguine spirit begets cheer and hope. 

6. Be trustworthy and be trustful. 

7. Do not place a light estimate upon the arts of good 
reading and good expression; they will yield perpetujil in- 
terest. 

8. Study to keep versed in world events as well as in 
local occurrences, but abhor gossip, and above all scandal. 

9. Banish a self-conscious spirit — the source of much 
awkwardness — with a constant aim to make others happy. 
Remember that it is incumbent upon gentlemen and ladies 
alike to be neat in habits. 

10. The following is said to be a correct posture for 
walking: Head erect — not too rigid — chin in, shoulders 
back. Permit no unnecessary motion about the thighs. 
Do not lean over to one side in walking, standing or sit- 
ting; the practice is not only ungraceful, but it is deform- 
ing and therefore unhealthful. 

11. Beware of affectation and of Beau Brummel airs. 

12. If the hands are allowed to swing in walking, the 
arc should be limited, and the lady will manage them 
much more gracefully, if they almost touch the clothing. 

13. A lady should not stand with her hands behind her. 
We could almost say, forget the hands except to keep 
them clean, including the nails, cordial and helpful. One 
hand may rest easily in the other. Study repose of atti- 
tude here as well as in the rest of the body. 

14. Gestures are for emphasis in public speaking; do not 
point elsewhere, as a rule. 

15. Greet your acquaintances as you meet them with a 
slight bow, and smile as you speak. 

16. Look the person to whom you speak in the eye. 
Never under any circumstances wink at another or com- 
municate by furtive looks. 

17. Should you chance to be the rejected suitor of a 
lady, bear in mind your own self-respect, as well as the 
inexorable laws of society, and bow politely when you 
meet her. Reflect that you do not stand before all wo- 
man-kind as you do at her bar. Do not resent the bitter^

do so withoiu being urged, or refuse in a way that shall 
be final; and when music is being rendered in company, 
show politeness to the musician by giving attention. It is 
very impolite to keep up a conversation. Il you do noi 
enjoy the music, keep silent. 

22. Contentions, contradictions, etc., in society should 
be carefully avoided. 

23. Pulling out your watch in company, unless asked 
the time of day, is a mark of the demi-bred. It looks a,; 
if you were tired of the company and the time dragged 
heavily. 

24. You should never decline to be introduced to any 
one or all pf the guests present at a party to which you 
have been invited. 

25. A gentleman who escorts a lady to a party, or who 
has a lady placed under his care, is under particular obli- 
gations to attend to her wants and see that she has proper 
attention. He should introduce her to others, and en- 
deavor to make the evening pleasant. He should escort 
her to the supper table and provide for her wants. 

26. To take small children or dogs with you on a visit 
of ceremony is altogether vulgar, though in visiting 
familiar friends children are not objectionable.

7- In eating game or poultry do not touch the bones 
with your hngors. To take a bone in the fingers for the 
purpose of picking it is looked upon as being verv inele- 
gant. 

8. Never use your own knife or fork to help another. 
Use rather the knife or fork of the person you help. 

9. Never send your knife and fork, or either of them 
on your plate when you send for a second supply. 

10. Never turn your elbows out when you use your 
knife and fork. Keep them close to your sides. 

11. Whenever you use your fingers to convey anything 
to your mouth or to remove anything from the mouth 
let it be the fingers of the left hand. 

12. Tea, coffee, chocolate and the like are drank from 
the cup and never from the saucer. 

13. In masticating your food, keep your mouth shut' 
otherwise you will make a noise that will be very offen- 
sive to those around you. 

14. Don't attempt to talk with a full mouth. One thing 
at a time is as much as any man can do well. 

15. Should you find a worm or insect in your food say 
nothing about it. 

t6. If a dish is distasteful to you, decline it, and without 
comment. 

17. Never put bones or pits of fruit on the table-cloth. 
Put them on the side of your plate. 

18. Do not hesitate to take the last piece on a dish 
simply because it is the last. To do so is to directly ex- 
press the fear that you would exhaust the supply. 

19. If you would be what you would like to be— abroad, 
take care that you are what you would like to be— at 
home. 

20. Avoid picking your teeth at the table if possible: 
but if you must, do it, if you can, where you are not 
observed. 

21. If an accident of any kind soever should occur dur- 
ing dinner, the cause being who or what it may, you 
should not seem to note it. 

22. Should you be so unfortunate as to overturn or to 
break anything, you would make no apology. You might 
let your regret appear in your face, but it would not be 
proper to put it in words.

sot) 



Social Duties, 



1. Mcihbprshlp in Socioty,~Many fail to get hold of thf 
idea tlwit they arc members of society. They seem to sup- 
pose that tlie social machinery of the world is self-opcrat- 
lag. They cast their first ballot with an emotion of pride, 
perhaps, but are sure to pay their first tax with a groan. 
They see political organizations in active existence; the 
parish, and the church, and other important bodies that 
embrace in some form of society all men, are successfully 
operated; and yet these young men have no part or lot in 
the matter. Tkey do not think of giving a day's time to 
society. 

2. Begin Early.— One of the first things a young man 
should do is to see that he is acting his part in society. 
The earlier this is begun the better. I think that the 
opponents of secret societies in colleges have failed to esti- 
mate the benefit which it must be to every member to be 
obliged to contribute to the support of his particular organ- 
ization, and to assume personal care and responsibility as a 
member. If these societies have a tendency to teach the 
lessons of which I speak, they are a blessed thing. 

3. Do Your Part.— Do your part, and be a man among 
men. Assume your portion of social responsibility, and see 
that you discharge it well. If you do not do this, then you 
are mean, and society has the right to despise you just as 
much as it chooses to do so. You are, to use a word more 
emphatic than agreeable, a sneak, and have not a claim 
upon your neighbors for a single polite word. 

4. A Whining Complniner.— Society, as it is called, is far 
rnore apt to pay its dues to the individual than the indi- 
vidual to society. Have you, young man, who are at home 
whining over the fact that you cannot get into society, done 
anything to give you a claim to social recognition? Are 
you able to make any return for social recognition and 
social privileges? Do you know anything? What kind of 
coin do you propose to pay in the discharge of the obligation 
which comes upon you with social recognition? In other 
words, as a return for what you wish to have society do for 
you, what can you do for society? This is a very important 
question— more important to you than to society. The 
(Question is, whether you will be a member of society by 
right, or by courtesy. If you have so mean a spirit as to be 
content to be a beneficiary of society — to receive f a.vors and 
to confer none — you have no business in the society to which 
you aspire. You are an exacting, conceited fellow. 

5. What Are You Good For?— Are you a good beau, and 
are you willing to make yourself useful in waiting on the

Social Duties. 



a man differs from you, do you differ from liim: and that 
from tiis standpoint you are naturally as rcpulbwetohim.as 
he, Iroin your standpoint, is to you. So, leave all this talk 
of congeniality to silly girls and transcendental dreamers. 

Q. 1)0 BiiHincss ill Your Mny and He Houest.— Do vour 

business in your oun way, and concede to every man the 
privilege which you claim for yourself. The more you mix 
with men, the lets you will be disposed to quarrel, and the 
more charitable and liberal will you become. The fact that 
you do not undcrstinut a man, is quite as likely to be our 
tauli as his. There are a good many chances in favor of 
the conclusion that, if you tail to like an individual whose 
acquaintance you make it is through your own ignorance 
ana illiberality. So 1 say, meet every man honestly ; seek to 
know him; and you will find that in those points in which 
he differs from you rests his power to instruct you, enlarge 
you, and db you good. Keep your heart open for every- 
body, and be sure that you shall have your reward. You 
shall find a jewel under the most uncouth exterior; and as- 
sociated with homeliest manners and oddest ways and ugliest 
faces, you will find rare virtues, fragrant little humanities, 
and inspiring heroisms. 

10. Withont Society, Without Influence.— Again: you 
can have no influence unless you are social. An unsocial 
man is as devoid of influence as an ice-peak is of verdure. 
It is through social contact a.d absolute social value alone 
that you can accomplish any great social good. It is 
through the invisible lines which you are able to attach to 
the minds with which you are brought into association alone 
that you can tow society, with its deeply freighted interests, 
to the great haven of your hope. 

11. The Revenge of Society.— The revenge which society 
takes upon the man who isolates himself, is as terrible as it 
is inevitable. The pride which sits alone will have the 
privilege of sitting alone in its sublime disgust till it drops 
mto the grave. The world sweeps by the man, carelessly, 
remorselessly, contemptuously. He has no hold upon 
society, because he is no part of it. 

12. The Conclusion of the Whole Matter.— You cannot 
move men until you are one of them. They will not foUovv 
you until they have heard your voice, shaken your hand, and 
fully learned your principles and your sympathies. It 
makes no difference how much you know, or how much you 
are capable of doing. You may pile accomplishment upon 
acquisition mountain high; but if you fail to be asocial man, 
you rob yourself and others of m.any blessings.

politeness especially 



— /-s"''^ »"' i"c personality ot others. A 

man will respect the individuality of another if he wishes to 
be respected himself. He will have due regard for his 
views and opinions, even though they differ from his own. 

1 ne well-mannered man pays a compliment to another and 
sometimes even securer his respect by patiently listening to 
him. He IS simply tolerant and forbearant. and refrlins 
from judging harshly ; and harsh judgments of others will 
almost invariably provoke harsh judgments ot ourselves. 

4. The Impolite. — The impolite, impulsive man will, 
however, sometimes rather lose his friend than his ioke. 
He may surely be pronounced a very foolish person who 
secures another s hatred at the price of a moment's gratifi- 
cation. It was a saying of Burnel, the engineer— himself 
one of the kindest-natured of men — that "spite and ill- 
nature are among the most expensive luxuries in life " Dr 
Johnson once said : " Sir, a man has no more right to' sav a 
rude thinff to another than to knock him down ^'

Politeness. 



lUardness and repulsiveness of manner. It may not proceed 
from malignity so much, as from want of bympathy, and 
wantof delicacy— a want of that perception of, and Jittyn- 
tion to. those little and apparently tritliMg things, by which 
pleasure i'^ given or pain occasioned to others. Indeed, it 
may be said that in self-sacrifice in the ordinary intercourse 
of life, mainly consists the difference between being well 
and ill bred. Without some degree of sclf-iestraitit in so- 
ciety a man may be found almost insufferable. No one has 
pleasure in holding intercourse with such a person, and he 
IS a constant source of annoyance to those about him. 

6. Disregard ofOthers.— Men may show thtir disregard 
to others in various impolite ways, as, for mstance, by 
neglect of propriety in dress, by the absence of cleanliness, 
or by indulging in repulsive habits. The slovenly, dirty 
person, by rendering himself physically disagreeable sets 
the tastes and feelings of others at defiance, and >s rude and 
uncivil, only under another form. 

7. The Best School of Politeness.— The first and best 
school of politeness, as of character, is always the home, 
where woman is the teacher The manners of society at 
large are but the reflex of the manners of our collective 
homes, neither better nor worse. Yet, with all the disadvan- 
tages of ungenial homes, men may practice self-culture ot 
manner as of intellect, and learn by good examples to cul- 
tivate a graceful and agreeable behavior towards others. 
Most men are like so many gems in the rough, which need 
polishing by contact with other and better natures, to bring 
out their full beauty and lustre. Some have but one side 
polished, sufificient only to show the delicate graining of the 
Ulterior- but to bring out the full qualities of the gem, needs 
the discipline of experience, and contact with the best 
examples of character in the intercourse of daily life. 

8 Captlonsnesa of ManiK^r. — While captiouprcss of 
manner, and the habit of disputing and contrar :Mi . ■ v 
thine said, is chilling and repulsive, the opp ^u. jt 

assenting to, and sympathizing with, every statement made, 
or emotion expressed, is almost equally disagreeable. It is 
unmanly, and is felt to be dishonest. "It nriay seem difh- 
cult," says Richard Sharp, "to steer always between bliint- 
• ' s- ?nd Dlain dealing, between merited praises and lavish- 
' . iiscV-.minate flattery; but it is very easy— good humor,

HOW TO WRITE INVITATIONS. 

Invitation to dinner conveys a great mark of respect. It 
is the highest social compliment that can be offered by one

Dinner parties rank first among all entertainments, and 
they are a great source of elevation and education.

HOW TO AMUSE 



A busy child is always happy, and whoever possesses the 
faculty to keepv a child busy has a great advantage in a 
liousehold. 

We will enumerate some very simple methods for amusing 
small children: Ablockof wood.asaucerful of tacks, and a 




1 4' 



(■■ 




3 -JO 



How to Amuse Little Children. 



small tack hammer will give a child more amuse- 
ment than almost anything that can be devised. It may 
make a little noise in the house, but it will amuse the child 
for a long time every day. A pair of blunt pointed scis- 
sors, with plenty of newspaper pictures, or other pictures, 
to cut out, will give amusement of which children rarely 
ever tire. A cheap box of paints for coloring the pictures 
is an excellent diversion and a good practice. 

Little ones find great pleasure in stringing buttons, and 
they can soon learn to make ornamental work by sewing 
them on cloth in simple designs. 

Little girls are always delighted with a doll, but many 
parents make mistakes by not teaching them to dress and 
undress tl^e dolls, and make jackets, dresses, etc., for 
them. For little children a heap of clean sand will afford 
an unending source of amusement. Children will dig it 
over and over again, mold it in all sorts of shapes and 
forms, and seemingly never tire of it. The older children 
will extract pleasure from it also. 

Empty spools, both large and small, can be utilized to 
form many a little toy carriage, engine, and the like. A 
nice set of blocks, home made or purchased, afifords one 
of the best amusements for children. In order to give the 
best results there should be from twenty-five to fifty 
blocks; different forms are preferable. 

The simplest toys will generally afford as much amuse- 
ment as expensive ones, and in the homes where money 
can purchase every conceivable luxury there is probably 
no more happiness among the children than in the hum- 
blest homes of the poor, if the parents will but utilize 
what facilities they have in preparing playthings for their 
children.

Games for Children, 



The leader may hold a bouquet and give to each 
child llie liowcr chosen. 

The next child, "Buttercup," being duly "found," takes 
the place of "Dafifodil," and tlu child who has held 
that place goes into the ring. The newcomer calls out 
the name of some flower, like bright blue-bell, daisj 
flower or mignonette, and substituting the word, thej 
sing as before. Each child tries to be ready with the 
name of some favorite flower, and the game may close 
when each child flower has been "found." 

Fox.— A game in which the children can run is alway* 
a favorite. "Fox" is another ring play, so easy t.hai 
the smaller children can play it without help. One of the 
children "fox" stays outside the ring and slyly slaps the 
shoulder of one of the children. "Fox" runs to the left, 
the child to the right. They meet, pass each other going 
at full speed around the ring. The one who gets back 
to the "den" (the place in the ring where the child was 
standing) may hold that place, and the other must be 
the fox and try a race with some other child. 

"Jingle Bells" is another frolic whicV ^leases little 
ones. Let mamma or the hostess harness up' the children 
for a "team." They have a string of small bells around 
their necks, and a cambric or tarlctan rope is used for the 
"tackle"— the children taking l-.old of it by twos, ex- 
cept the last in line, who acts as "driver." The pianist 
plays the well-known college glee, "Jingle bells, jingle 
bells, jmgle all the way," and the children trot away at 
a merry pace. The leaders hurry on, making devious 
turns to right and left, supposably through snowdrifts 
and over high hills and down in deep valleys. The 
children sing the chorus, and the trip proves so delightful 
that they are never ready to stop until a very long 
journey has been made. 

The above games may all be successfully played by 
a large party of children. 

Whatever new plays the children may learn they dearly 
love the old, old games: 

"Buflfy" and "Puss" and the "Needle's eye," 
;'Tag" and "Thimble" and "Halt! I spy," 
"Ring-round-a-rosy," and "Making a cheese," 
Bean-porridge-hot" and "Slave, on your knees!" 
'Man on your castle," "Stage-coach" 'and "Gool,"

A <JlJOTATION HUNT. 

This game is best described by one who was present and 
enjdved its pleasures. 

LJl)(iii entering, by invitation, a friend's |)arl()r one even- 
ing List June, 1 was puzzled by the sight of the numerous 
little slips of paper that seemeil to be everywhere — pinned 
to curtain, chair, mantel lambreiiuin and cushions, over 
table and i)iauo cover, on i)'cture-frames and on bric-a- 
brac the little slips found lodgment. Tresently the guests 
arrived, and our hostess informed us that on each slip was 
written one-cpiarter of a familiar (piotation. We might 
pick up any slip we wished antl proceed to find the rest 
of the quotation of which it fornietl a part. We were 
allowed to ask for parts of (piotations, the one asked being 
obliged to hand over the slip asked for if he or she hap- 
pened to have it. At a given signal we started and a lively 
time ensued, the object being to see who could match the 
greatest number of quotations. I first picked up a slip 
on which I read, "to see ourscls," I found "Oh! wad sae 
power" in the hands of one of the company. "The giftie 
gie us" had taken refuge in the corner of a white picture- 
frame, and "as ithers see us" was nestled comfortably in 
a fold of a portiere 

The prizes were appropriate, but inexpensive, the most 
elaborate one being a dainty booklet for the most success- 
ful searcher, while the member of the company who had 
been least successful received a pair of steel-rimmed spec- 
tacles, to which was attached a note expressing the hope 
that they would aid in future searches. 

DISTINGUISHED GUESTS. 

Not long since I accepted an invitation to spend the 
evening at a neighbor's. At eight o'clock we found our- 
selves in the pleasant parlor of our hostess. In the course 
of an hour other guests came until we numbered fifteen. 

The two young ladies, our hostesses, stated that a num- 
ber of distinguished guests had been invited, but being 
unable to come had sent their cards to represent them. 
The younger sister then passed a tray of cards, on which 
were the names of friends who could not be with us. 
Each one present had the privilege of drawing a card, but

TO PLACE WATER IN A DRINKING GLASS UPSIDE 

DOWN. 
Procure a plate, a tumbler, and a small piece of tissue 
or silver paper. Set the plate on a table, and pour water 
into it up to the first rim. Now very slightly crumple up 
the paper, and place it in the glass; then set it on fi'e. 
When it is burned out, or rather just as the last flame 
disappears, turn the glass quickly upside down into the 
water. Astonishing! the water rushes with great vio- 
lence into the glass! Now you are satisfied that water can 
be placed in a drinking glass upside down. Hold the 
glass firm, and the plate also. You can now reverse the 
position of the plate and glass, and thus convince the 
most skeptical of the truth of your pneumatic experiment 
Instead of burning paper a little brandy or spirits of wine 
can be ignited in the glass; the result of its combustion 
being invisible, the experiment is cleaner. 

GUESSING. 

Guessing is. a game that whiles away many an hour 
pleasantly, as the children gather around the kitchen fire 
while the evening work is being done. One of the party 
thinks of an object and gives the first letter of its name. 
For instance, one thinks ofa ship and says, "I have thought 
of something and it begins with S.' The rest then question 
him and he must answer as best he can unless the question 
comes too close and he declares it would be "telling." They 
may ask: What color is it? Is it something made, or does it 
grow? Has it legs? Does it move about, or is it stationary? 
Is it vegetable, animal or mineral ? Have we one? Of course 
some will be easily guessed and others will tax the ingenu- 
ity of the best guessers. In a compound word the first 
letter of each word should be given. 

Mothers with the little ones trooping around them can 
make the evening exceedingly pleasant and something to 
look back upon with pleasure in after years.

A woman who is at the head of a household has vast

with her to make the home a place where there si all be

expressibly dear to each member of the family; where all 
shall fee that there is perfect freedom, yet where there is 
also perfect order. Some are born housekeepers while 
others must work hard to train themselves for ?her many

natural housekeeper; if the work be done well Jnd Mov-

GOOD RULES FOR THE MISTRESS. 

1. When engaging a servant be careful to explain her 
work to her, and let her understand that the wSrk must 
be done in your way and not in the way of any former 
mistress she may have had, and this explanation must be 

oihi^ TouSofd.^'^^" "°' ''^-' "p°" '^^ -"^- °^ -^ 

2. Try to arrange the housework so that each servant 
may have an opportunity to attend church on Sunday 

3. When your servants do well encourage them to do 
better by a few words of praise. 

4. Do not allow them to have visitors until after certain 
hours in the evening. 

^ .«;. Give your orders for the day to tie rook as earlv 
in the morning as possible. 

6 Insist upon being informed when anything is broken 
or lost. 

7. See that the chambermaid is wearing a clean apron 
while making the beds, ana that she knocks at the bed- 
room doors before entering. 

8. Order the maid who opens the door, not to leave 
visitors standing in the hall, nor to give parcels to stran- 
gers without previous instruction. 

9. When you reprove, do so firmly and decidedly. 

10. Only allow your rules to be broken once; let dis- 
missal, witu customary notice, follow the second offense

THE SERVANT QUESTIOxV. 

The vexed question of "domestic service" is a serious 
one, and like its companion problem, the "labor question," 
its solution can hardly be satisfactorily accomplished in 
this country, where our servants and our "lower classes" 
are made up of aliens, many of whom are untrained and 
unfitted for the positions which they undertake to fill. 

American-Born Women instinctively object to domestic 
service as a means of livelihood. They are usually fairly 
well educated, as our excellent public school system gives 
opportunities to all. The American girl would do any- 
thing rather than domestic service; she considers it menial 
and beneath her, and so, when she starts out for herself 
in the vvorld, she undertakes type-writing, or telegraphy, 
or clerking in an office, or she becomes an amanuensis or 
a factory hand, or does everything else rather than the 
work for which she is thoroughly well equipped both by 
experience and inheritance. It is a very rare thing to 
find an American girl in service; and when she is dis- 
covered, what a joy she is to the finder, for we are sure 
we have in our house honesty, energy, and often great 
capability.

alone sufficient for adornment; besides, we do not ah 
possess either time or skill for this sort of decoration. 

There is much satisluction in possessing a few bits 
of real china, or a blender vase of undoubted Venetian 
glass; but if our purses arc shallow, we can satisfy our 
artistic longings in some very pretty imitations. Doubt- 
less we should draw John Ruskin's thunders on our de- 
voted heads by expressing any delight in make-believes, 
but often enough there is little difference, save in the 
price. 

Newly Married People.— As a rule, newly-married peo- 
ple have a good many trifles in ornamental china, in the 
way of wedding presents, either artistic or the reverse, 
as the donor's taste may incline. So the only thing 
the possessors have to decide upon is the question of 
arrangement. In a well-filled modern house there is 
usually a cabinet or over-mantel above the fireplace, es- 
pecially in a well-appointed dining-room, and this is the 
best position for showing off china. If an over-mantel 
cabinet is beyond one's reach, the next best thing is a 
drapery falling from a curtain pole at the back of the 
mantel; a continuation of this forms the mantel scarf. 
This is especially desirable when the wall is light-colored. 
A dark felt or plush curtain of harmonious shade forms 
such an admirable background. Of course, this is in- 
tended chiefly for throwing into relief the china on 
the mantel, though it has a decorative effect on the whole 
room. 

Wall Decorations.— We can obtain very good effects 
with china plates or placques as wall decoration in any 
nook or corner where they may be comparatively iso- 
lated. They lose something of their effect when mingled 
\vith a lot of pictures. A very striking over-mantc . decora- 
tion may be made where the chimney piece projects from 
the wall by putting a curtain rod up against the ceiling 
and dropping a curtain from this to the mantel. On this 
curtain drapery arrange china plates that are handsomely 
decorated, fastened, of course, by invisible placque hang- 
ers. The curtain may be felt, plush or any of the artistic 
draperies in vogue; it need not necessarily be expensive, 
for the best effects, appropriateness and artistic blend- 
ing with the wall coloring is of first importance. 

Another form of the same idea is to have a beveled 
rnirror the width of the mantel, and about two feet 
high, put at the back to reflect the mantel ornaments,

must economize closely, let fashion be neither the first, 
second nor third consideration. 

The Jttistros8. — The individuality of the mistress should 
be plainly manifest in her pai-lor. Give little attention 
to parlors in general, and no le to the opinion of Mrs. 
Grundy. After arranging the larger pieces of furniture in 
the most favorable positions, place the chairs at whatever 
angle best conforms to the remaining space and tends to 
heighten the general eflect. If in doubt as to how this 
should be done, study the arrangement of the chairs the 
next time they are vacated by some of your "dear con- 
genial friends," and see if you cannot catch the air of ease 
and sociability they carry. 

Avoid Regularity,— Avoid apparent regularity. Don't 
think because you place a sofa across one corner of a 
room that you must treat any or all the other corners 
similarly. While a scheme of arrangement is essential, 
care must be taken to conceal it. Large pieces of furni- 
ture are not appropriate for small rooms; nor is any piece 
seen at its best unless there is room for its individuality 
to assert itself. In a library that is only used as a reading 
and writing room, and in a dining-room, the table is 
properly placed in the center of the floor, but not in any 
other apartment. A dining-room side-table should be 
placed in a corner conveniently near the pantry door. 
Table for card-receiver m main hall should stand conven- 
iently near the front door or the entrance to the parlor. 
If the hall is used merely as an entrance, stand the chair 
or chairs against the wall. If used as a waiting or recep- 
tion room, treat in a less formal manner. 

Sitting-Rooni.— In the sitting or living room the com- 
fort and convenience of the family must decide the ar- 
rangement of furniture. 

Bedroom. — In the ordinary bedroom, windows are the 
only means of ventilation, and the location of these shouM 
go far to determine the most desirable place for the bed- 
stead. Placing the head of a bedstead against the wall 
causes little discomfort to the occupants, but there should 
be a free circulation of air on all the other sides. Put the 
wash stand in the most inconspicuous corner, and conceal 
with a large screen, if the room is large enough to do so 
without making a nuisance of the latter. 

Kitchen Furniture.— Kitchen, pantry and laundry furni- 
ture should be arranged in the way that best conduces to 
the convenience and comfort of those who labor in them.

either cover. You will find them with a single cover; 
with a double cover, the inner one perforated, and with a 
double cover, the outer one perforated; and the best of 
all is the one which I have mentioned. In conclusion, let 
me say, if you own a rose bush, by all means have a rose 
jar. It is not only a delightful thing to prepare, but once 
prepared, you will find it 

"A thing of beauty, and a joy forever." 
A Rustic Flower Stand.— A neat stand can be made 

by taking a crotched stick hav- 
ing three branches as shown in 
the accompanying figure. The 
branches should come from the 
main trunk at about the same 
point, and be equally distant from 
one another at their lower ends. 
Such a stick can easily be found 
in the forest, and with a little 
labor an ornamental and service- 
able flower stand can be had 
without any outlay of money. 

Sewing Box.— This is a-simple 
and very useful and convenient 
addition to the utensils of the 
busy housewife. It can be made 
at home by any one with very lit- 
tle skill at carpenter work. Make 
a box out of common pine lum- 
ber 24 inches in length by 16 
inches wide and 16 inches high. 
Make the arms as shown in the 
picture 27 inches high. The cover 
»s put on hinges and straps pre- 
vent Its fallmg backward; castors are placed under 
the corners. Tack a sheet of wadding over the boards 
inside and out, and then cover with denim or cretonne, 
using brass-headed nails and white tape as illustrated on the 
following page. The inside is fitted with strips of tape and 
pockets of every size and shape to form a safe retreat 
for scissors, thread, needles, tapes, elastic, buttons, hooks 
and eyes, etc. 

When the cover is down, it forms a pretty chair and no 
one would suspect that it contains undarned stockings 
and all the family mending awaiting a leisure hour to 
be attended to.

sands of articles that make home attractive. And thes«» 
"^ed "ot be confir d to the homes of the wealthy, but the 
humblest home in the land with proper care and fore- 
thought can be made more homelike by taking free that 
which IS offered in nature's storehouse. The shells of 
the ocean; the leaves, twigs and bark of trees; the grasses 
and flowers of fields and meadows; the mosses of the 
A° u ' ^"^ *^^ insects of the woods are all at our service 
A home-made bird nest bracket, a shell bracket, a bracket 
made of ferns, grasses, leaves, mosses and set ofT with but- 
terflies or other insects may add beauty and bring cheer- 
fulness where most needed. 

Ferng.— Ferns whose exquisite beauty of form and grace 
of outline cannot be destroyed are abundant in our 
shaced woodlands and in sheltered nooks. They should 
be pressed very carefully when nearly full grown. These 
when painted with pale green paint, mixed with linseed 
oil, may be tastefully arranged in brackets of straw and 
splints, or simply glued on a pasteboard frame with moss 
fe-rasses or leaves. Do not use turpentine to thin the paint 
It will give the ferns an unnatural color. Ferns can in 
this way, be used for decorating picture frames, mantels 
and beautifying unsightly corners. They can be arranged 
by a network of string held in place by small wire nails. 
Autumn Leaves.— Leaves should be collected before the 
rains bleach them. After being carefully pressed and 
dried, they can be prepared by being dipped into a mixture 
of^ white wax and a little gamboge. Keep the wax 
at proper temperature, so that it does not set in lumps 
on the leaves, or, on the other hand, curl or crimp them 

<irasseg should be collected as soon as they become wiry 
and stiff. The prettiest grasses are found in marshes and 
along the sea shore. They can be bleached by being dip- 
ped into strong boiling soda water and then laid on racks 
m a tight box where a little sulphur is burned under 
them. They are then dried in a hot sun. It is often 
necessary to repeat the process. Some flowers are 
bleached by using strong castile soap suds instead of 
soda. Be sure that your grasses are thoroughly bleached 
before coloring them. The best method of coloring them 
is by using the aniline dyes. Some colors take in a 
few minutes, while others require much boiling before 
the colors are set. These grasses made up into bouquets, 
or used m a variety of ways, provide adornments for 
rooms. At little or no cost your home chu be made 
more homelike by their use. Try it I

ble, however, discard comforters and use only blankets, 
which are more healthful and cleanly. Have the mattress- 
es, pillows and bolsters thoroughly beaten and aired. 
Dust the springs of the beds, and when the form of the 
springs is such that you can do so, make a covering of 
strong calico. It should be sewed at both ends and one 
side. Slip the springs in at the open side, which should 
then be sewed up. This prevents the accumulation of 
dust on the springs, saving an immense amount of trouble. 
Get the wide, light prints that upholsterers use for the 
covering of fine stuffed furniture. It is a little more ex- 
pensive than common calico, but it pays in the end. This 
covering a'':o protects the mattress from rust. Make cov- 
ers of strong unbleached cotton for mattres." .3, and have 
these covers vvashed twice a year. They must be made 
open on the side, and, when the mattress is slipped in, 
the sides must be basted together. 

While the bedding is airing, take down the bed and dust 
it thoroughly. Lay the head, foot and side pieces on the 
floor, grooved sides up, and pour naphtha into all the 
grooves and creases. It will not hurt the floor or carpet 
if it should run over upon them. Have the windows 
open, of course, whenever you use naphtha. Let your bed 
stand this way for several hours; then set it up and bring 
in the mattresses and other bedding. There is not the 
slightest danger in using naptha if the windows in the 
room and adjoining hall or rooms be opened, that the 
gases shall escape, and if there be no light or fire in the 
rooms. If you have some blankets to be washed, select 
a bright, windy day, and if this be their first washing, rip 
off the bindings, if colored cotton or worsted, and bind 
the blankets anew with the lossely-woven white braid 
that comes for flannels. 

Airing the Sleeping Boom.— In cold weather there is 
possibly a tendency to be a little neglectful in the matter 
of fresh air for the sleeping rooms, especially if they are 
so situated as to get but little artificial heat. 

But in winter, even more than in summer, the poison- 
ous exhalations of the body during sleep must be gotten 
rid of, or the air breathed at night becomes very impure. 
Why is it that the tone of the system is generally lowered, 
and that many people need a tonic or a "blood purifier" 
in the spring? Simply because the manner of living has 
not been in accordance with the strict laws of health, and 
largely because the sleeping rooms have not been suffi- 
ciently aired.

where, more perhaps than in any other room in the house, 
there ought to be an abundance of sweet, wholesome, and 
refreshing air. 

Houie Made Mattresses.— The advantages of the home- 
made mattresses over the store mattresses is that one has 
the satisfaction of knowing what is in them, which can- 
not be said of the purchased ones. Then, too, by making 
one's own mattresses one has more money to buy the 
springs and bedding. I have had many of my friends 
copy my mattresses, which I make of the best of fancy 
blue stripe ticking. Cut the proper lengtn and width, 
with side and end pieces as wide as you wish. When 
sewed up with an opening m the top piece, fill with as 
much excelsior as you can press in, sew up the opening, 
and tie just as the store ones are. Use an upholsterer's 
needle. I knot with three or four strands of colored 
warp, which makes them look prettier. The "filling" can 
be procured for a song generally. Tie a row of knots 
around the sides and ends, and when your work is com- 
plete you will vote them the prettiest mattresses you ever 
saw. To make my beds more comfortable I make top 
mattresses of 6-cent tennis flannel, putting twelve rolls of 
cotton in each one and knotting like comfortables. 
They are far superior to feather beds, as the latter 
never get renovated often enough. When I want to 
wash them I take them out in the shade on a big 
table and scrub them on both sides with a new scrub 
brush made of broom splints, and they are easily and 
quickly cleansed. Now hang them on a wire line 
and pour on cold water, rinsing in this way until the 
water runs oflF clear. I wash comforts the same way, 
exceptmg the cheese-cloth ones; these I wash with my 
pounder" washer, which gets them nice and white, and 
they are as light as a feather. No need of taking tliom 
apart, it is tedious and unnecessary. Sanitary laws re- 
quire the inside to be clean, too. 

Spare Bed.— Don't let your guests sleep in the spare 
bed without first giving it a good airing. A good way 
to test the sheets for dampness is to lay a hand mirror 
between them. If it comes out blurred, give them some 
other bed. 

Gnest Chamber.— Sometbing interesting to read is a de- 
nrable provision for the g.jst chamber. A bright novel, 
the latest magazine, or a book of short stories will always 
he appreciated by the guest who does not always wish to 
stay with the family to entertain or be entertained. A

"rare done," but properly cooked, and carefully prepared 
previous to the cooking. 

Good (Quality.— Nor can we hope for a Rood dinner, or 
other meals, unless the materials comprising ii are of 
then selves of a good quality— no strong butter, stale eggs, 
meat that is under a cloud. Nor will coarse brown sugar 
make a delicate cake or jelly. Such a condition of things 
must of necessity produce an inferior meal. 

White China.— Pure white china, dainty and pretty, is 
taking the place of the ornate china that has been so long 
in vogue. 

Simplicity.— The simpler the appointments of a dinin? 
room are, the better it is. It is comfort rather than show 
that is to be considered. 

The Appointments of the table should be of the best 
you can command— the linen of snowy whiteness, the 
silver bright and shining, sparkling glass clear and clean, 
with well-pohshed and sharpened cutlery. These give an 
air of refinement and elegance to the simplest repast, and 
are a crown of luxury to the feast. 

" Hot.»»— Then this rule should be followed out in the 
various dishes, served with neatness and care, and not the 
east in consideration, all should be placed on the table 
hot. 

Punctuality should be the motto, and the table should 
not be kept waiting for any belated guest. Flowers are 
always a beautiful adjunct to the table, from the simplest 
rose, standing all alone in its beauty, to the bevy of lovely 
flowers just gathered, dripping with dew, from the garden. 
To this we add a prevailing spirit of frierdliness and har- 
mony, with refinement of manners. 

Enjoyment Complete.— If these requirements be fulfilled, 
the pleasure, I am sure, will be more than realized, and 
your enjoyment be complete. 

Napkins and Doilies.— For ordinary dinners the doillies 
should be three-fourths of a yard in size, and marked, if 
marked at ail, with letters an inch and a half long. 

Luncheon and breakfast napkins are five-eighths of a 
yard square. 

Tea napkins should not be longer than half a yard 
square. 

The little fringed designs are prettiest for this purpose. 

Never introduce any colors except in flowers. 

Never employ heavily-scented blossoms for table decora- 
tion, as the strong perfume is very nauseating to some 
people.

Recipes often call for weights and measures, in fractions, 
of a pound or a cup. If the cook is not accurate in 
her measurements more or less of failure results. The fol 
lowmg have been carefully verified and can be relied upon, 
Girls who are learning to cook will find them helpful, if 
kept close at hand for reference. 

A teaspoonful, tablespoonful or teacupful is one filled,

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

Throw flour on kerosene flames. 
Try molasses for grass stains. 
Ripe tomatoes will remove ink stains. 
Remember, slamming the door of the oven makes 
cake fall. 

A few drops of lemon juice make cake frosting very 
white. 

A hot shovel held over varnished furniture will take out 
white spots. 

Try sprinkling powdered cloves about the places in- 
fested by red ants. 

A little flour dredged over the top of a cake will 
prevent the icing from running. 

There should be just as much conscience put into 
dusting a room as in managing an estate,. 

The Ivy-decked house is picmresque, but the damp, 
ness and insects that linger in the greenery are not. 

Early-riHing means a whole day's work done before 
noon, a consideration that hot weather makes desirable. 

Hard-finished iraUs may be cleaned by using one-half 
cupful of ammonia in a pail of water. 

When poHshing mirrors, windows or picture glass with 
whitening, the best way to use it is to have it in 
muslin bags. Dampen the glass lightly, then rub with 
the bag and polish off with a crumpled newspaper. 

Window panes,— Warm water into which a small quan. 
tity of turpentine has been poured will clean glass globes, 
window panes and mirrors in the most satisfactory way! 
A few drops of alcohol in warm water is also good for 
burnishing glass. 

To Prevent Frosted Windows.— Apply a very thin coat- 
mg of glycerine to both sides of the glass and no mois- 
ture will settle thereon. 

To Remove Wrinkles from Woolens.— Stretch the gar- 
ments and hang them ove- night in a heated room. 

To Polish Iron.— A solution of vinegar and salt is the 
best thing to clean polished iron as well as copper. Heat 
the salt and vinegar in the frying pan or other dish. 
Rub ofif the stains, then wash it of! and scour it with 
sand soap.

358 Housekeeping, 

HOW TO HAVE LAMPS BURN BRIGHTLY. 

In these days when lamps are used so much, the care 
of them is quite an important matter. If the lamps be 
good and have proper attention, one cannot wish for a 
more satisfactory light; but it badly cared for they will 
be a source of much discomfort. The great secret of 
having lamps in good working order is to keep them clean 
and to use good oil. Have a regular place and time 
for trimming the lamps. Put a folded newspaper on the 
table, so that any stray bits of burned wick and drops 
of oil may fall upon it. Wash and wipe the chimneys 
and shades. Now take off all loose parts of the burner, 
washing them in hot soap-suds and wiping with a clean 
soft cloth. Trim the wicks and turn them quite low. 
With a soft, wet cloth, well soaped, wipe '. turner 
thoroughly, working the cloth as much as poss.Hle inside 
tne burner, to get off every irarticle of the charred 
wick. Now fill the lamps within about one inch of the 
top, and wipe with a damp towel and then a dry one. 
Adjust all the parts and return them to their proper 
places. Whenever a new wick is required in a lamp, wash 
and scald the burner before putang in the wick. With 
a student lamp, the receptacle for waste oil, which is 
screwed on the bottom of the burner, should be taken 
off at least once a week and washed. Sometimes a wick 
will get very dirty before it is half consun \. It is not 
economy to try to burn it; replace it with a * jsh one. 
The trouble and expense are slight, and the increase in 
clearness and brilliancy will repay the extra care. Wh^jn 
a lamp is lighted, it should not at once be turned up to 
the full height; wait until the chimney is heated. Beautiful 
shades are often cracked or broken by having the hot 
chi" ;neys rest against them. Now, when lighting a lamp, 
be careful that the chimney is set perfectly straight, and 
does not touch the shade at any point. The shade should 
be placed on the lamp as soon as it is lighted, that it 
may heat gradually. 

Lamp Burners.— At least once a month lamp burners 
should be boiled in strong, soapy water; lamp wicks 
should as often be washed in soap suds; lamp chimneys 
s^hould not be washed, but moistened with steam, wiped 
with soft linen, and polished with paper. A ctoth and 
kerosene give a good bright surface. 

Keep Your Oil Lamp Full.— Scarcely a day passes but

Removing SMirt, 



ft 




Stains on the Hands.— A teu drrnn ol oil vitriol (sul. 
phuric acid) in water, v j take tuv. stains of fruit dark 
dyes, stove blacking, etc trfim the hands without injuring 
them. Care must, howev-f, be taken not to drop it upoh 
the clothes. It will remove the color from woolen, and eat 
holes in cotton fabrics. To remove ink or fruit stains from 
the fingers, take cream of tartar, half an ounce; powdered 
salt of sorrel, half an ounce ; mix. This is v^.. . .for 
salts of lemon. 

RemoTlng Grease From Silk.— Apply a little magnesia 
to the wrong side, and the spots will disappear. 

To Clean Fnvs.— Shake and whip them well; then brush; 
boil some flax p-d; dip a rag in the water and wipe them 
slightly. This makes them look nearly as good as new. 

To Preserve Furs.— First, hang them out in the sun for 
a day or two, Jien give them a good beating and shaking 
up, to be sure no moth is in them already. Then wrap up a 
lump of camphor in a rag, and place in each; then wrap up 
each in a sound newspaper and paste together, so there is 
no hole or crevice through which a moth can gain entrance. 
, To Clean Velvet.— Wet a cloth and put it o er a hot flat- 
iron, and a dry one over that; then draw ihe velvet across it, 
brushing it at the same time with a soft brush, and it will 
look as nice as new. 

Wrinkled Silk.— Wrinkled silk may be rendered nearly as 
beautiful as when new, by sponging the surface with a weak 
solution of gum-arabic or white glue; then iron on the 
wrong side. 

To Make Cloth Water-Proof.-Inapailofsoft water put 
half a pound of su^ar of lead, half a pound of alum; stir 
this at intervals until it becomes cool; then pc ir it into an- 
other pail and put the garm -t therein, and^^ t it be in for 
twenty-four hours, and theu hang ;£ up to dry without 
wringing it. 

To Color Kid Gloves,— Put a handful of logwood into a 
bowl, cover with alcohol, and le' oak until it looks strong 
,— one day, perhaps. Put one giove on the hand, dip a small 
woolen cloth or sponge into the liquid, wet the g\o\z all 
over, rub it dry and hard until it shines, and it will - anice 
purple. Repeat the process, and it will be blaci;.. 

Washing Kid GIOTes.- First, see tha* -ur hands are 
clean, then put on your gloves and wash jnr ts though 
you were washing your hands, in a basir f si its of tur- 

Eentine. This method is used in Paris, i ue gloves should 
e hunq in the air, or some dry place, to carry away the 
smell ol turpentine.

the faintest mark is removed. 

BOIIAX. 

Borax is very useful as a medicine. But to the house- 
keeper it is unspeakably more valuable. 

Meats and fruits are now sent long distances when 
packed in it, and even fish are sent in its solution a 
thousand miles. The happy possessor of a garden can 
lay away her early summer fruits— her currants and 
gooseberries and cherries, her blueberries, her damsons 
—in layers of dry borax, and have them fresh and sweet 
m the middle of winter, carefully brushing and washing 
them before bringing them to the table, and her borax 
IS good for another season. The laundress finds it soft- 
ening hard water, whitening her clothes without destroy- 
ing them, and removing the dreaded fruit stains, giving 
transparency to her muslins, and renovating her laces; 
the kitchen maid finds it cleansing both her porcelain 
saucepans and her coiifee-urn, and its occasional use 
sweetening the tea-kettle and every pot she uses; the 
table girl finds it giving a new luster to her glass, lays 
her silver in a hot solution of it, and then does not have 
to cleanse it laboriously half so often; and the house- 
maid finds it renewing the brightness and color of her 
V oil-cloth, and taking, as if by magic, all the finger marks 
and soiling from wood-work. 

TO REMOVE TEA STAINS. 

Mix thoroughly soft soap and salt, say a tablespoonful 
of salt to a teacupful of soap, rub on the spots and spread 
the cloth on the grass where the sun will shine on it. Let 
it lie for two or three days, then wash. If the spots 
are wet occasionally while lying on the grass, it will 
hasten the bleaching. 

The Broom Should Hang.— Some of the daintiest 
housekeepers neglect to enforce the rule that a bru.sh 
or broom should never be stood brush-part down on the 
floor, where the straws or hair gather dust or damp- 
ness. Every one of these articles should hang from its 
own hook, and, as this is apt to bring the soiled part 
against the wall, it is well to stretch a breadth of muslin 
or calico along the wall from the floor up, so that even 
the washboard is protected from stain. The muslin, of 
course, is washed whenever necessary. As all brooms 
and brushes are not provided with "hangers," a Yankee

HOW TO CLEAN BRASS. 



First rub over with a little lemon-juice, and then dry 
thoroughly; then place the article in paraffin, and let it 
soak for three or four hours. Take it out, and while wet 
rub thoroughly with emery powder. The ordinary knife 
powder will do. Use a piece of old flannel, or new, if you 
have no scraps of anything else. When c' an rub the 
article well with a clean duster, so as to remove all the 
powder, and then finish off with a leather. Of course the 
rubbing in of the powder takes time, but the result is per- 
fection. 

Rust may be removed from steel by rubbing the article 
with kerosene oil and leaving it for twenty-four hours. 
Then rub thoroughly with a mixture of kerosene and fine 
emery powder.

FUR?fITURE POLISH. 



A simple furniture polish for common use is ttiniJe by 
mixing two tablespoonfuls of sweet or linseed oil with a 
tablespoonfu) of turpentine. Rub on with a piece of flannel 
and polish with a dry piece. 

HOW TO MAKE OIL FIxNISHED FURNITURE 
LOOK MEW. 

Many good housekeepers are often at a great loss in 
knowing how to keep varnished furniture, and the kind 
generally J^nown as "oil finished," looking fresh and new, 
without going to the expense of having it re-varnished or 
gone over by a finisher. Here is a never-failing polish; 
After thoroughly dusting the article and cleaning off what- 
ever specks may be on it, she should mix and apply the 
following: Take one teaspoonful of pure cider vinegar 
and add to it one gill of pure raw linseed oil. Shake thor- 
oughly until mixed. Apply with a soft woolen rag, rub- 
bing gently. It is only necessary to dampen the rag with 
the mixture and not to thoroughly wet it. It soon dries 
and leaves the article with a bright, new face. This 
preparation has the advantage of not gumming, but giv- 
ing a fresh look to every article of furniture it is applied to. 

HOW TO STAIN A FLOOR. 

Take one-third turpentine and two-thirds boiled linseed 
oil, with a little japan dryer added. Buy a can of burned 
sienna, and blend it thoroughly with this mixture. This 
gives a rich reddish brown. Mix the paint quite thin, so 
that it will run readily. Lay it on with a good-sized brush, 
stroking the brush the way of the grain of the wood. Put 
on several coats, allowing each one to become perfectly 
dry. Lastly, give the floor a good coat of varnish, and 
when thoroughly dry it will be found as satisfactory as a 
stained floor can be and easily kept clean. 

THE CARE OF HARDWOOD FLOORS. 

Parquetry Floors.-The parquetry inlaid floors are much 
more easily cared for, as well as more durable, when 
polished w^ith wax than any other preparation. 

In laying a new floor the best paste filler should be 
thoroughly applied by one who understands his business

HOW TO MAKE A PERMANENT OUT-DOOR 
WHITEWASH. 

Take good lime and slake it in sour milk, and when 
slaked dilute with water until it is of the consistency of 
ordinary whitewash, then apply with a brush. 

Another Method.— Slake the lime with sufficient water 
to make a thick mush. While still hot stir into it a pound 
or more of tallow to a peck of lime. Then thin the lime 
\yitl! water and apply with a brush. It is best to have a 
little hre to keep the lime warm while using it, 

HOW TO PURIFY SINKS AND DRAINS. 

To one pound of common copperas add one gallon of 
boihng water, and use when dissolved. The copperas is 
deadly poison, and should always be carefully labeled if 
kept on hand. This is one of the best possible cleansers 
of pipes and drains. 

HOW TO CLEAN GILT FRAMES. 

When the gilt frames of pictures or looking-glasses, or 
tlie gilt mouldings of rooms have specks of dirt upon 
them, from flies or other causes, they can be cleaned with 
the white of an egg, gently rubbed on with a camel-hair 
pencil. 

HOW TO MAKE A PERFECT HOLE IN A PIECE 

OF GLASS. 

First cover the glass with a little stiff clay or putty 
where you desire to drill the hole. Then make a hole into 
the clay, or putty, the size of the desired hole to be made 
through the glass. Then pour into this hole a little melted 
lead, and unless the glass is very thick, it will make a per- 
fect and regular hole. 

HOW TO POLISH WOOD. 

_ Take the plain surface of any timber or board and soak 
It in linseed-oil for a week, and then rub it briskly for a 
few minutes with a new cloth every day for ten days and

How to Make Vinegar. 




HOW TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF TINEGAB.

■ -h 




Cider Vinegar. 

Vinegar making is easy enough if you have good cider 
and patience. Keep the barrel in a warm place, filled up 
to the bung, refilling as needed. When done working 
draw off into an old vinegar barrel, filling it not over 
two-thirds full. Keep the buug hole covered with a piece 
of screen to exclude vinegar flies. If kept in a warm 
place it may make good strong vinegar in less than six 
months' time. In an ordinary cellar it will take longer. 

Common Yinegar. 

8 gallons rain water, 

3 quarts molasses, 

2 yeast cakes. 
Shake well. Put in a warm place, and in ten days add a 
sheet of wrapping paper covered with molasses and torn 
into strips; it makes the mother. 

Yinegar for Pickles. 

4 quarts of vinegar; 2 cups of sugar; 3 nutmegs, grated; 
2 large onions, sliced; Vi cup of grated horse-radish; i 
ounce of mustard seed; i ounce of celery seed; i ounce ot 
salt; V-i ounce of mace, V2 ounce of black pepper; i ounce 
of allspice.

HOW TO RAISE CANARIES AND KEEP THEM 
HEALTHY AND IN GOOD SONG 

1. In summer keep them out of doors in some cool and 
shady place. 

2. In fall, winter or spring, hang the cage so that no 
draught of air can strike the bird. 

3. Give nothing to healthy birds but rape, hemp, 
canary seed, water, cuttle-fish bone, and gravel paper or 
sand on the floor of the cage. 

4. A bath three times a week. 

5. The room should not be ove 

6. When moulting keep warm 
of air. * 

7. Give plenty of German summer rape seed. A little 
hard boiled egg mixed with cracker, grated fine, once or 
twice a week, is excellent. 

8. Feed at a certain hour in the morning. 

DISEASES AND CURES. 

9. Hnsk or Asthma. — The curatives are aperients, such 
as endive, water cresses, bread and milk and red pepper. 

10. Pip.— Mix the pepper, butter and garlic and swa]< 
out the throat. 

M. Sweating.— Wash the hen in salt water, and dry 
rapidly. 

12. Costiveness.—Plenty of green food and fruit. 

13. Lice,— Keep a saucer of fresh water in the cage, and 
the bird will free itself.

THE DELINEATOR. 



HOW TO ENLARGE PORTRAITS AND PICTURES FOR 
PAINTING AND DRAWING. 

Also How to Enlarge Eiubroidery, Rraidiiig Patterns, Mats, 
Engraving Capital Letters, Scrolls, Music, Etc, 

1. The Delineator, as shown in the above engraving, 
is fastened to a table or board with a little screw or awl. 
The little steel point at "A" rests on the picture or work 
to be copied. The pencil in the band copies as fast as tha 
steel point traces the small picture. The Delineator is set 
to enlarge four times by the little finger screws "B" and 
"C." If you wish your picture the same size as the copy, 
put the screws at number one. If you wish your picture 
twelve times as large as the copy, put the screws in num- 
ber twelve in each of the four bars. 

2. Keep the pencil sharpened under the hand. It is 
not necessary to watch the pencil in the movements of the 
hand, but to watch the steel point at "A." 

3. Now any one can easily make a delineator, by going 
to the hardware store and securing a few little screws, as 
shown in the cut, and then making or securing four little 
pieces of wood, as shown in the illustration, of about two 
feet in length. If pictures are to be very much enlarged, 
the sticks may be made larger, so that the delineator may 
enlarge twenty-five or one hundred times.

//ow to Dye Cloth in Permanent Colors. 




HOW TO DYE ALL KINDS OF CLOTH IN PERMANENT 

COLORS. 



For Cotton Goods, Woolen, Silk, Etc. 

YELLOW. 

To color yellow, take one ounce of bichromate of potadi 
and two ounces of sugar of lead. Dissolve them separately 
in as much hot water as will cover the goods. Dip into 
potash water first. 

The above will color two pounds of cotton goods. 

BLUE. 

Dissolve one ounce Prussian blue and two ounces ox- 
alic acid in enough cold water to cover the goods. Will 
color two pounds of cotton goods. 

GREEN. 

Dissolve one ounce of Prussian blue in cold water. Let 
goods remain in over night, then proceed as for yellow. 

BLACK. 

Soak the cloth in acetate of iron mordant, and then 
boil in a decoction of madder and logwood. 

FOR WOOLEN GOODS, SILKS, LINENS, ETC. 

Use Diamond Dyes. The colors will remain permanent 
in woolens, silks and linens, but for cotton cloth they are 
not satisfactory.

890 Paints, -IIoxv to Tan I fides. 

In the prccoiliiiR tabic of the combination of colors 
rccjuirccl to produce a desired tint, the t'lrst-nanied color is 
always the principal ingredient, and the other, follow in 
the order of their importance. Thus in mixing a lime- 
stone tint, white is the principal ingredient, and the red 
the color of which the least is needed. The exact pro- 
portions of each color must be determined by experiment 
with a smaller quantity. It is best to have the principal 
ingredient thick, and add to it the other paints thinner. 




HOW TO TAN HIDES WITH HAIR ON. 






A cheap and simple process is to apply to the flesh side, 
when fresh and wet, a mixture of two parts of saltpetre 
and one part alum. These should be finely pulverized and 
sprinkled over every part of the skin; double in flesh to 
flesh, roll up and let it lie a day or two; then with a dull 
knife remove the flesh and fat, if any has been left. When 
about half dry, commence rubbing and continue working 
until dry. The skin will be found very nice, white and 
pliable, and the hair firmly set.

HOW TO IMPROTE LEATHER. 

To Soften Leather.— Castor oil is the best thine with 
which to soften leather. 

To Remove Grease Stains from leather apply benzine 
and afterward the beaten white of an t^^. 

Best Dressing.— Vaseline is said to be one of the best 
dressings for russet shoes, and spirits of turpentine the 
correct thing for cleaning and brightening patent leather. 

You Can Tell a Woman by Her Slioes.-Slovenly shoes 
a slatternly person; neat and clean shoes, a natty and nice 
Irttle woman. So it is well to look after this small detail. 
If your kid "uppers" lack the freshness of the new article, 
we following will be found a cheap and good renovator: 
Yolk of one egg, one ounce of castor oil, one drachm of 
turpentine, two drachms of gum arable, three ounces of 
writing ink. 

Something About White Shoes.— A light evening toilet 
is not complete without white shoes or slippers; and a 
white shoe that is soiled is execrable. There are many 
popular fallacies in this world; one is that raw eggs are 
not good to eat, and another that white shoes are perish- 
able. Perishable, indeed! My white shoes have lasted 
me longer than any shoes I have ever had, and with noth- 
ing more than a little "elbow grease" to preserve them. 
Any druggist will sell you ten cents worth of pipe clay. 
And who does not possess an old tooth brush? With 
these two articles there is no excuse for the dustiness 
of your white shoes. Use the pipe clay dry, taking care 
always to rub the way of the grain, so as not to roughen 
the suede. Do not be afraid to brush hard, or to get 
too much of the clay on the shoe. You cannot get too 
much on, and unless you are an athlete, with an arm 
of iron, I do not believe you can brush too hard. Pipe 
clay, used in the same way, will also clean trimmings of 
white cloth if they are excessively soiled. Use the clay 
wet; it will make them look badly at first, but if brushed 
carefully with a clean brush and fresh water, it will dry 
off in a most satisfactory manner. I have kept a little

THE ART OF COOKING. 

" The nnmber of inhabitants who may be supported In Huy oonntry 
opon its internal produce depends about as much upon the state of 
the art of cookery as upon that of agriculture ; but if cookery be of so 
much importance, it oortainlT deseryeB to be studied with the flneatest 
of care. Cookery and agriculture are arts of civilisod nations. Say. 
\ understand neither of them."— Count Rumford'$ Work$, Vol. i. 



The importance of the art of cookery is very great; in- 
deed, from the richest to the poorest the selection and 
preparation of food often becomes the chief object in life. 
The rich man's table is luxuriously spread; no amount of 
money is spared in procuring the rarest delicacies of the 
season. Art and nature alike contribute to his necessi- 
ties. The less wealthy have, indeed, fewer resources; yet 
these may be greatly increased by the knowledge of what 
may be called trifling details and refinement in the art of 
cookery, which depends much more on the manner of 
doing a thing than on the cost attending it. To cook well, 
therefore, is immensely more important to the middle and 
working classes than to the rich, for they who live by the 
"sweat of their brow," whether mentally or physically, 
must have the requisite strength to suj^ort their labor. 
Even to the poor, whose very life depends upon the prod- 
uce of the hard-earned dollar, cookery is of the greatest 
importance. Every wife, mother or sister should be a 
good plain cook. If she has servants she can direct them, 
and if not, so much the more must she depend upon her- 
self. To such we venture to give a tew general hmts. An 
old saying (to be found in one of the earliest cookery 
books): "First catch your hare, etc.," has more signif- 
icance than is generally supposed. To catch your hare 
well you must spend your income judiciously. This is the 
chief thing. In our artificial state of society, every in- 
come, to keep up appearances, has at least half as much 
more to do than it can afford. In the selection of provi- 
sions, the best is generally the cheapest. Half a pound of 
good meat is more nutritious than three times the amount 
of inferior. As to vegetables, buy them fresh. Above all, 
where an income is small and there are many to feed, be 
careful thalt all e nourishment is retained in the food that 
is purchased. This is to be effected by careful cooking. 
Cleanliness is an imperative condition. Let all cooking 
utensils be clean and in order. Uncleanliness produces 
disorder, and disorder confusion. Time and money are 
thus wasted, dinners spoiled, and all goes wrong.

as nice as new ones. 

Butter that has become stale may be made sweet for 
pastry by boihng it in plenty of water and a little 
soda, a teaspoonful being enough for four or five pounds 
Let It get cold, take the cake off and boil again in clear 
water. When it is cold, scrape the bottom dry and 
pack away for use. 

HINTS ON SEASONING. 

Sliced onion fried in butter or in butter and flour, 
and rubbed through a sieve and put into soups just 
before servmg, gives a fine flavor and good color. 

A dash of black pepper greatly improves vanilla ice 
cream. 

Make snow cake with arrowroot flour; the flavor is 
delicious. 

Bean soup is much improved by adding a little mace 
just before serving. 

When making corn bisque, use cayenne with a little 
sugar for seasoning. 

Add a cup of good cider vinegar to the water in 
which you boil fish, especially salt water fish. 

Boston baked beans can be greatly improved by ad- 
ding a cup of sweet cream the last hour of baking. 

1 ?. °",/?P °^ ^'^ ^^^" baking thin slices of salt 
pork; It will ba-^te the fish and the seasoning is fine 

Put sugar ir.to the water used for basting meats of 
all kinds; it gives a good flavor to veal more especially. 

To give a fine flavor to corn beef hash use good soup 
stock for moistening, with a pinch of salt, sugar and 
cayenne. * 

Three tablespoons of freshly-made Japan tea. with 
a bit of nutmeg, gives an indescribable flavor to an apple 

. Put a few sticks of cinnamon bark and a little lemon 
juice with crab apple when making jelly; the flavor is 
good, or use pineapple instead of the lemon. 

To give an appetizing flavor to a broiled beefsteak, cut 
an onion in half, and rub it over the hot platter with the 
melted butter. 

When flavoring has been forgotten in a pudding or 
cake, the fault may be remedied by rubbing the desired 
extract over the outside of the cake as soon as it is 
taken out of the oven.

ADYICE TO COOKS. 



Iinportanc< i>f Cooking.— No matter how large the es- 
tablislinuiit. no piTson holds a more important part than 
the cook, tor wilh her rests not only the comfort, but 
the heahh of those she serves, and we would warn all 
cooks not to make light of their responsibilities, but to 
study diligently the tastes and wishes of all those for 
whom they have to prepare food. 

CleaniinesH.— A dirty kitchen is a disgrace, both to mis- 
tress and maid, and cleanliness is a most essential in- 
gredient in the art of cooking. It takes no longer to ii .v.; 
a clean and orderly kitchen than an untidy and dirty 
one, for the time that is spent in keeping it in good order 
is saved when cooking operations are going on and every- 
thing is clean and in its place. 

Dress.— When at your work, dress suitably; wear short, 
plain gowns, well-fitting boots, and large aprons with 
bibs, of which every cook and kitchen njaid snould have 
a good supply, and you will be comfortable as you never 
can be with long dresses, small aprons, and slipshod 
shoes, the latter being most trying in a warm kitchen. 

Kitchen Supplies.— Do not let your stock of pepper, 
salt, spices, .«;ec.^onings, etc., dwindle so low that there 
is danger, in the midst of preparing dinner, that you 
find yourself minus some very important ingredient, there- 
by causing much confusion and annoyance. 

MEATS. 

There seems to be a general impression that a con- 
tinued meat diet is absolutely essential and with some 
it seems to be unwise to omit it for a single meal. 

There is no civilized country in the world in which so 
much meat is eaten or in which so much is wasted 
by bad cooking, by profusion, or by absolute unthrift. 

We all eat too much meat, too much for our Health, 
probably, and certainly too much f-- ih'^ /rell-being of our 
pocketbooks. Great, brawny Scoi " , !' live m' nth 
after month on oatmeal and butt.r , i^., . ' a heaU.^iei', 
harder working class of men it v.ould be uiificult to find. 
The general health of the American would be gjeatly 
improved if the diet were to consist more of vegetables, 
grains and fruit and not so much of meat. 

Cooking Meat. — We are profuse in our provision of 
meat and then we are apt to cook it in the most wasto- 
^vA way. With many the sum total of a knowledge of 
cooking is to get a joint or a steak and roast or broil — 
say, r";her, to bake or fry it, at a range or cooking

Meats. 



Another Method of Boillngr Meat.-Put a piece of meat 
into boiling water and continue the boiling. The sur- 
face of the meat suddenly whitens and the nutritious sub- 
stance IS thereby not permitted to escape from the meat. 
1 he outside of the meat is seared and the juices are kept 
'"•■,. * he temperature must now be lowered or the meat 
will be overcooked." If meats are allowed to boil too 
fast they toughen, all their juices are extracted, and only 
the fiesh fiber, without sweetness, is left; if they boil too 
long they are reduced to a jelly and their nourishing 
properties are transferred to the water in which they are 
boiled. Nothing is more difficiilt than to boil meat ex- 
actly as It should be; close attCxition and good judgment 
are indispensable. 

Frying in Fat.— If we put a thin piece of meat, as a cut- 
let coated with eggs and bread crumbs, into boiling fat. 
the albumen in the surface or rather in that of the egg 
surrounding it is thickened or coagulated and the juices 
will be retained in the meat. For frying always use an 
abundance of fat in the pan. This is no waste, as the 
same fat can be used over and over again by pouring it 
'^m^"!,".? strainer into a crock kept for the purpose. 

To Bake Meat.— Make some beef fat hot in an iron 
pan or broad kettle. Put the meat into it, and with a 
fork stuck into the fat, turn it rapidly till it is on all 
sides a line brown, then put it into a hot oven, elevating 
It above the pan on a meat rack, or a few iron rods. Now 
comes the process called basting; in five minutes or less 
you will find that the top of the meat has dried, and you 
must now dip, with a spoon, the hot fat from the pan over 
the top. Do this every few minutes, adding no water to 
the pan; you will find your meat well cooked in from 
12 to IS minutes to the pound. It is done when it has lost 
in the middle the blue color, and becomes a fine red. 
Unly salt and pepper should be used to season such roasts 
and must be added when the meat is half done; earlier 
It toughens the fibers. 

Meat and Soup.— To make soup crack the bones and 
cut up the meat mto small pieces and put on the stove in 
coia water, cook slowly several hours, cool, remove the 
tat and rewarm, adding flavors to taste before serving 
Do not remove the scum which rises while boiling, as this 
IS the most nourishing part. The soup meat may after- 
ward be chopped, moistened with some of the soup, fla-

STUFFED BEEF'S HEART. 

If fire is no object, you may boil a beef's heart, it will take 
all day. Put into cold water and bring slowly to the sim- 
mering point and keep it there. Next day it may be stuffed 
with well-seasoned bread crumbs and baked three quarters 
of an hour. 




HOW TO SERVE ROAST BEEF A SECOND TIME. 

Heat the gravy, put the roast in it. After tramming it 
into shape again, cover closely and put into a hot oven for 
ten minutes, or less, according to size of piece. 

Or, cut in slices and lay in hot gravy, only long enough to 
heat them through. 




HAM CAKES. 

Take one cup finely chopped boiled ham, two cups of 
breadcrumbs, two eggs, pepper and salt, and enough milk 
to make quite moist. 

To use. First: Fry on a griddle in small spoonfuls, and 
turn as pancakes. 

Second: Use mashed potatoes instead of breadcrumbs, 
and fry as above.

How to Cook All Kinds of Poultry. 




PREPARED FOR ROASTING. 

HOW TO COOK ALL KINDS OF POULTRY. 

1. Poultry should never be eaten in less than twelve 
hours after it has been killed; but it should be picked 
and drawn as soon as possible. 

2. After picking and drawing chickens it is well to wash 
them in three waters, adding a little soda in the last water. 

3. When buying turkeys notice carefully the legs; if 
they are rough and reddish the bird is old; if smooth and 
black it is young. 

4. If the fowl is old or tough, a little soda in which it is 
boiled will make it tender. 

5. A pan of water placed in an oven with a roasting 
fowl will keep it from scorching. 

6. Wild game first fried in butter before boiling will 
greatly improve the flavor. 

7. Chickens, unless of the very tenderest spring brood, 
and Ducks and Turkeys are far better when dressed, 
stuffed and steamed until tender, then brown nicely in 
the oven. This makes an easy Sunday dinner, as all the , 
labor may be done on Saturday with only a half hour's 
cooking Sunday. 

8. Young fowls should never be fried but always broil- 
ed. Split down the back, butter and broil over clear coals. 
They may be finished in the oven after four or five min- 
utes broiling. The flavor is finer and they digest much 
easier when fried. Use the bones for soup.

CORN OMELtT. 

HOW TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF OMELETS. 

CORN OMELET. 

For this take young tender sweet corn; shave off the 
kernels, scrape out the rest with a dull knife, being care- 
ful not to get in any of the cob. For 4' large ears, add 3 
well-beaten eggs, 2 tablespoonfuls cream, or the same 
amount of milk with a tablespoonful butter, a pinch of salt 
and a little pepper. Place a tablespoonful butter in a 
spider, and when hot pour in the omelet. As soon as it 
sets, turn or fold it over and take up on a hot platter. 
Omelet is best if eaten hot. 

VEGETABLE OMELET. 

Cold cooked asparagus, French beans, carrots, cabbage, 
cauliflower sprigs, spinach, sorrel, tomatoes, mushrooms.' 
etc., are all suitable to introduce into an omelet. Chop 
very finely the vegetable or vegetables in question— for a 
mixture is often preferred to only one kind— then mix 
thoroughly with the eggs; be careful to add appropriate 
seasonings, and proceed as already directed, serving with 
sauce, or not, just according to taste and convenience. 
Always continue the beating for some time after the last 
addition has been made to insure the ingredients beinp 
thoroughly blended, as this is the most important point. 

FISH OMELET. 

The remains of almost any kind of fresh fish may, with 
great advantage, be used for this purpose, and only a very 
small quantity is required— about two large teaspoonfuls 
for four eggs. After carefully removing the bones and

NEW EGG DISHES. 

EGG ON TOAST. 

Put one quart of boiling water and one tablespoonful 
of salt in a frying-pan. Break the eggs, one by one, into 
a saucer and slide caix fully into the salted water. Cook 
until the white is firm. Lift out carefully and place on 
toasted slices of bread. Serve immediately. 

SALAD EGGS. 

Boil the eggs hard, turning them several times to pre- 
vent the yolks from settling on one side. When cool 
peel ofif the shells, cut across neatly with a sharp knife, 
remove the yolks and mash them smooth, mix with them 
some good salad dressing, taking care not to make the 
mixture too thin. 

Return this mixture into the white part, and place the 
two halves together neatly, so as to look as if it had 
never been cut. Lay each egg in a fresh lettuce leaf. 

Excellent for picnics and luncheons 

CREAMED EGGS. 

Boil six eggs twenty minutes. Make one pint of cream 
sauce. Have six slices of toast on a hot dish. Put a layer 
of sauce on each one, and then part of the white of the 
eggs, cut in thin strips; and rub part of the yolks through 
a sieve onto the toast. Repeat this, and finish with a third 
layer of sauce. Place in the oven for about three minutes. 
Garnish with parsley, and serve. 

STUFFED EGGS. 

Cut six hard-boiled eggs in two. Take out the yolks and 
mash them fine. Add two teaspoonfuls of butter, one of 
cream, two or three drops of onion juice, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Mix all thoroughly. Fill the eggs from 
the mixture, and put them together. There will be a 
little filling left, to which add a well-beaten egg. Cover 
the other eggs with this last preparation, and roll in 
cracked crumbs, Fry in boiling lard till a light brown.

POTATOES. 

We in our country need not feel as bitter against the 
potato as do the scientists of Europe, for we are not 
obliged to use it to excess, and considering its cheapness 
and availability, it is for us a good vegetable, and on these 
accounts, though it makes a poor enough showing as to 
food value, we must rank it next to the bean in impor- 
tance. The quality of the potato is of great importance, 
and none but the best should be used. It should be of 
a mealy variety and perfectly ripe. 

How Potatoes May be Spoiled.--In a bulletin issued by 
Professor Snyder, of the Minnesota State Agricultural 
College, he makes a point of interest to the housewife. 
He shows that where potatoes are peeled and started boil- 
ing in cold water there is a loss of 80 per cent, of the total 
albumen, and where they are not peeled and are started in 
hot water this loss is reduced to two per cent. A bushel 
of potatoes, weighing 60 pounds, contain about two 
pounds of total nitrogenous compounds. When improp- 
erly cooked one-half of a pound is lost, containing six- 
tenths of a pound of the mosit valuable proteids. It re- 
quires all of the protein from nearly two pounds of round 
beefsteak to replace the loss of protein from improperly 
boiling a bushel of potatoes. 

Scalloped Potatoes.— Peel and slice thin, then lay in 
a stew pan a layer of potatoes, sprinkle with pepper, salt, 
a little flour and a piece of butter the size of a walnut, 
then another layer of potatoes, then the seasoning, and so 
on until the pan is full. Fill the pan half full with sweet 
milk, put into the oven and bake twenty or tiutty minutes. 

POTATO SOUP. 

Ingredients. — Six large potatoes peeled, i large onion, 
I heaping teaspoon salt, J4 teaspoon pepper. For a richer 
soup add X pound salt pork cut in bits (in this case put in 
less salt), or add i cup of milk or a beaten egg. Chopped 
celery leaves give a good flavor. 

Boil potatoes, onions and salt in a little water, and when 
very soft mash ; then add, a little at a time, and stirring to 
keep it smooth, a quart of hot Wter and i tablespoon beef 
fat, in which i tablespoon flour has been cooked; or use 
the fat for frying bread dice, which add at the last minute. 

Most cooks fry the sliced onion before putting it in the 
soup, but the difference in taste is so slight as not to be 
worth the few minutes' extra time, if time is an object.

A FEW KOVEL YE{;tTABLE DISHES. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Great care should be used in r-icking out all the defective 
or rotten portions of vegetables before cooking. It is 
better to soak vegetables an liour or two before cooking. 

The water should always boil before putting in the vege- 
tables. 

Hold onions under water nhilc peeling, as it will pre- 
vent the odor from affecting the eyes. 

BAKED BEETS. 
Beets are nearly always boiled, but if baked right, they

BREAD. 



Prize Bread Recipe.— At a bread contest held in an 
eastern city not long ago, a milling company offered 
prizes ranging from five to one hundred dollars for 
the best loaves of bread. The recipe used by the win- 
ner of the prize of one hundred dollars was: Three 
pints of water, one half pint of milk, one tablcspoonful 
of lard, one tablespoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
salt, one yeast cake, and the necessary quantity of flour to 
make three loaves. The ingredients, which were first 
thoroughly mixed, and then kneaded ten minutes, were 
raised over night in a covered bread-p?n. In the morning 
the dough was kneaded ten minutes and made into three 
loaves. Three other loaves entered for the contest were 
awarded seventy-five-dollar prizes. One of these loaves 
seems to have been prepared in a somewhat unusual way. 
The ingredients for the dough were two-thirds milk to 
one-third water, compressed yeast and a little salt and 
sugar, and were mixed with enough flour to make a stiff 
dough. This dough was mixed, kneaded, and set to rise 
at night. When light it was chopped thoroughly with a 
chopping-knife, made into loaves, and set to rise the sec- 
ond time; when this was light it was baked forty minutes. 

BREAD. 

Sift four quarts of flour into your bread-pan, leaving 
cavity in the center. Stir in equal parts of two quarts 
warm milk and water and, lastlj , atir in three pints of po- 
tato yeast, beating thoroughly for about five minutes; 
when light add a teaspoonful of salt, piece of butter size of 
an egg or one tablespoonful of lard, one tablespoonful of 
sugar; knead well (for about twenty minutes) and let rise; 
when light knead again, let rise and knead again. The 
fourth or last time let rise and put in tins, allowing 
to stand until light; rub over the top of loaves a light 
coating of drawn butter, bake in oven moderately heated 
for one hour. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 

Four teacups graham flour, one-half teacup brown sujfar 
one-half teacup molasses, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoop 
soda dissolved, one pint sour milk or buttermilk; bake in 
a slow oven two hours.

A FEW PRACTICAL RULES. 

Powdered sugar is better than granulated for baking 
cake. It dissolves more quickly. 

Always remcn,ber that baking powder and sweet nnik 
go together, and sour milk and soda. 

Do not use butter to grease baking pans. The salt in 
he butter makes the cake stick to the pan. Alwav,. „so 
iresn lard. 

If eggs are kept in a cool place they always beat better 
when broken. 

Continually opening the oven door makes a cake fall 
The oven door should never be opened for at least ten 
mmutcs after placing the cake into it. 

If molasses is used in cakes they should never be baked 
in a hot oven as they will burn very quickly.

How ta Make All Kinds of Frosting, 



FROSTING. 
Whites of 4 eggs, i pound of powdered sugar, lemon, 
vanilla or other flavoring. Break the whites into a broad, 
cool dish. Throw a small handful of sugar upon them, 
and begin whipping it in with slow steady strokes of the 
beater. In a short time throw in more sugar, and keep 
adding it until it is all used up. Beat perseveringly until 
icing is of a smooth, fine and firm texture. If not stiff 
enough put in more sugar. Lemon juice whitens the 
icing. 



\\ \ 





PLAIN FROSTING. 

Beat the white of one egg to a stiff froth, then stir in 
ten heaping teaspoonfuls pulverized sugar, well heaped, 
but not all you can take up on the spoon, and one of 
cornstarch; be sure that it is thoroughly beaten before 
taking the cake from the oven. Invert a milkpan, place 
the rake on the pan and apply frosting; it will be as 
smooth as glass, and adhere firmly to the cake.

HOW TO MAKE ALL KINDS OF PRESERVES. 



PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Stone the cherries, preserving every drop of juice. 
Weigh the fruit, allowing pound for pound of sugar. Put 
a layer of fruit for one of sugar until .-ill is used up; pour 
over the juice and boil gently until the syrup begins to 
thicken. 

The short-stem red cherries, or the Morellas are best 
for preserves. Sweet cherries will not do. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES. 
Pound for pound. Put them in a preserving kettle over 
a slow fire until the sugar melts. Boil twenty-five niinutt ^. 
fast. Take out the fruit in a perforated skimmer and 1.11 
a number of small cans three-quarters full. Boil and skim 
the syrup five minutes longer, fill up the jars, and seal 
while hot. Keep in a cool, dry place. 

PEAR PRESERVES. 

Weigh the pears after they are pan ■!, and to every 
pound add three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, water 
enough to prevent them from burning, and the peel of a 
small lemon cut very thin. Let them stew gently for six 
or seven hours. 

PEACH PRESERVES. 

Pare, stone and quarter ripe free-stone peaches. To six 
pounds of peaches allow three pounds of brown sug;ir. 
Put the sugar over the peaches and let them stand over 
night; next morning place them in a preserving-kettle 
and boil for two hours, keeping it well skimmed. 

CRAB APPLE PRESERVES. 

If Siberian crabs, wipe them only; if French, they must 
be pared. Put the apples in and let them simmer until 
they are done, into a boiling syrup, made from two pints 
of lump sugar and one pint of cider. Reduce the syrup, 
and skim until it is thick enough, and pour it over the 
fruit which has been placed in earthen or glass jars. 

RHUBARB PRZSERVES. 

Slice six oranges into a stew pan, with the rind cut verv 
small, a quart of rhubarb, cut fine, and two pounds of 
sugar. Boil the whole down as any other preserves.

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Two tablespoons oatmeal in one quart boiling water. 
Sift in slowly and boil one houi then strain and season. 

HOT MILK. 

Reduce the milk by adding one-tenth water. Heated in 
a double boiler to iio° F., or as hot as one can sip it 
slowly, it is a most valuable drink for any invalid. Espe- 
cially would it be well for nursing mothers to try, instead 
of the beer or porter so often ignorantly recommended to 
them. By its means mothers have been enabled to gain 
flesh during the nursing period, which usually is such a 
draught upon the strength and flesh. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 
Boil the dark meat of half a chicken in one quart of 
water with little rice or barley. Take off the fat and use 
as soon as the rice is well cooked. Add bits of brown 
toast. 




MACARONI SOUP. 
Break into small pieces a handful of macaroni. Boil one 
hour. Strain two cups stewed tomatoes, and add to it. 
with one cup of cream just before serving. 

FARINA SOUP. 
One half cup of farina, half cup of cream or one beaten 
egg, added to any soup stock, and boiled gently half an

How to Make Your Own Candies, 



"} 



I 







HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN CANDIES. 

1. It is very easy for people to prepare and make theii 
own candies. They will know of what they are made, and 
how they are made. In reference to extracts, flavors, 
acids, etc., they can be procured of your own druggist 
whom you personally know, and consequently no delete- 
rious drugs will enter into the composition of the candies. 

2. It is very necessary that a few things should receive 
special attention in making candy. 

3. Sugar boiled down to a sufficient thickness for candy 
will remain perfectly clear if not stirred. If it is in any 
way disturbed by dropping in nuts or other articles, it is 
liable to go back to sugar. 

4. Vinegar or other acids can be added to the sugar, 
and this will keep it perfectly clear, no matter how much 
it is stirred or disturbed. Never disturb candy that is 
intended to be perfectly pure and clear. 

5. Boil the sugar in a thick pan, or in a granite or 
porcelain kettle. 

WHY HOME-MADE CANDY IS BEST. 

The rhief constituents of candy, as will have been ob- 
served, are butter and sugar. The rest are merely inci- 
dents. This being so. no home should ever be without 
its candy. And what is there that children love better 
than to see their mother engaged in making candy? How

How their little mouth 5 water in blissful anticipation I 1 d<| 
not know whether the idea that home-made bread is betteff 
than baker's bread can be applied to candy. There 14 
this to be said about it, however, that one knows just ex« 
actly what the candy is when made at home, which if 
more than can be said of sweets retailed by many of thai 
small-fry confectioners. It is better and safer to make 
you own candy than to buy cheap mixtures. It is tho 
same with confectionery as with clothes. There are dif*' 
ferent grades, and the good grades represent a certain 
amount of money laid out in their manufacture. <• 

Home-made candy is cheaper, in that the cost of * B* 
is saved. But after all, little or no candy is made in thq 
home for the purpose of economy, or of avoiding pooc 
kinds of confectionery. When made at all, it is made 
for pleasure and amusement. On cold winter evenings 
a festive "taffy-pull" infuses warmth and gladness into the 
little ones. Even the older people derive much merriment 
and amusement from it. In this connection I might men* 
tion that butter is better to use for covering the hands 
than flour. The latter makes no end of bother for tb* 
housemaid after the fun is all over. 

HOME-MADE HOREHOUND CJLXHf, 

At the season of coughs and colds, how many wcir.eii 
know that a good horehound candy, soothing to tired or 
inflamed throats, can easily be made at home? Boil twf* 
ounces of dned horehound, which Caii be procured a^ * 
druggists, m a pint and a half of water until its fl-'vofl 
IS extracted; that xv 11 be in about half an hour StS

or tea three pounds and a half ©f brown su^arL^wi 
over a quick fire, until th^ syrup winhardenl'henf Ihdi 
of it is dropped Ml cold water. Pour into a buttered Hn

Take two cups of pulverized sugar nnd a half cup of 
cream Boil for five niinulcs. and divide off into balls

COCOANUT CREAM CANDY. 

Take one and one-half pounds of granulated sugar, and 
the milk from a cocoannt. Mix together, and heal slowly 
until sugar js melted; tien boil for five minutes. When 
boiled, add one cocoanut. finely grated, and boil for ten 
mmutcs longer, stirring constantly to keep it from burn- 
ing. When done pour on buttered plates and cut into 
squares. This will take about two days to harden. 

SOME TOOTHSOME GINGER CANDY. 

Take one cup of water to one and one-half cups of sugar 
and boil until, on applying your finger to the syrup, taking 
a little on the tip and quickly dipping it into water, it will 
roll up into a small ball. Flavor with essence of ginger 
or powdered ginger. Rub some of the sugar against the 
sides of the pan with a wooden spoon until it turns white

492 How to Make Soap. 

HOW TO MAKE HARD SOAP FROM SOFT. 

7 pounds of good soft soap, 

4 pounds of sal-soda. 
2 ounces borax, 

1 ounce hartshorn, 
Vi pound resin. 

Dissolve in twenty-two quarts of water and boil about 

twenty minutes, 

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST SOAP FOR WASHING 

FINE LINEN. 

To make the best washing soap, and one that is suitable 
for either laundry or toilet purposes, w'"ll not soil the finest 
fabric, or injure the most delicate complexion, use the 
following: 

Take lo pounds white bar soap, 

2 gallons of soft water, 

5 pounds sal-soda (common washing soda). 
Dissolve four ounces of borax and one ounce of salts of 

tartar in a little water; cut the soap into slices, and boil until 
dissolved; then add the soda and salts of tartar, and mix 
Uioroughly; pour into a box or mold, or cut into bars. 
This makes twenty-five pounds of soap which has no 
equal. 

Directions: Put the clothes to soak in warm water; 
soap each in proportion to the amount of dirt it contains 
—only the dirtiest will need rubbing. Rinse thoroughly, 
and your clothes will look better and wear longer than 
washed in any other way. Try it once, and you will never 
use any other soap. 

HOW TO POLISH OR ENAMEL SHIRT BOSOMS. 



To Polish or Enamel Slilrt Fronts. 

1 ounce of white wax, 

2 ounces of spermaceti. 

Melt together. Heat gently and turn into a very shallow 
pan: when cold cut or break into pieces. When making 
boiled starch the usual way, enough for a dozen bosoms, 
add to it a piece of the polish the size of a hazel nut.

thoroughly. Pour half the liquid while still warm over the 
flannels, letting them stand half an hour covered. Rub the 
flannel with the hands, but use no soap. Rinse the flan- 
nel in several clear waters of the same temperature. Then 
heat the remainder of the liquid, pour over the flannel 
again, and proceed as before, rinsing thoroughly; then 
hang out to drain and dry. 

HOW TABLE LINEN SHOULD BE LAUNDERED. 

The careful housekeeper never entirely intrusts her 
table linen to her help at home nor to her laundress 
abroad; she always prefers to superintend its washing and 
ironing, and has it done under her personal direction, foi 
the reason that no matter how handsome it may look 
when new, it immediately loses its beauty if poorly laun 
dered. 

All stains should be removed by first filtering cold 
water slowly through tea and coffee stains 

Wine stains may be removea by covering the stain 
while fresh with salt and then filtering the water through 
it. 

Linen should be very slightly starched, or, better still, 
ironed while quite damp until perfectly dry, this will give 
sufficient stiffness, and is the method employed by the 
best French and Swiss laundresses. 

In folding, fold the napkins square, and the tablecloths 
first lengthwise. 

If possible do not have small folds, one line each way 
from the center is enough. 

Have perfectly dry and aired before putting away. 

Embroidered doilies, centerpieces, and carving cloths 
have become fashionable pieces of fancy-work, and many 
of them are so handsome that they should receive the 
care necessary to preserve their beauty. 

If the cloth has been stained with fruit or coffee, the 
stained portion should be placed over a basin, and boiling 
water poured over it, allowing the water to run into the 
basin. Or, if a little salt and a few drops of lemon juice 
are put on it while still fresh, and the linen placed in the 
sunshine for an hour or two, all traces of the stain will 
usually disappear. 

Table-linen should not be used long enough to become 
badly soiled, as the hard rubbing necessary to get it clean 
is destructive to its beauty. Make a lather of soft water 
and ivory soap, and wash it between the hands— never

lalt to four quarts of water. The calico is dropped into the 
water while hot, and there remains until it is cold. 

Flannels.— To shrink baby tlaiuiels or white llannels of 
any sort, indeed, they should be put into an earthen basin 
and have boiling water poured over them; let them lie 
until the water is quite cold; in drying them don't wring, 
but shake, stretch and fold smoothly to keep the fabric 
even and then hang out. Bring them in while still damp, 
roll smoothly and in about half an hour iron with nearly 
a cold iron. 

To Whiten Clothes.— To improve the color of white 
cloths and clothing that have been washed, a spoonful of 
borax dissolved in a little hot water should be added to 
the last water in which they are rinsed. It will whiten 
the clothes very much. 

Shrinking of Flannels.— Many housekeepers, otherwise 
experienced and careful, have very vapue ideas as to what 
is going on in the laundry, or as to the necessity of 
varying processes for the cleansing of different fabrics. 

If you should examine the fiber of wool through a micro- 
scope, you would discover a series of tiny irregular sheaths 
with serrated edges, all running in the same direction. 
With the application of heat these miscroscopic sheaths 
expand and reach over one another; but with an exposure 
to a lower change of temperature they hurriedly contract, 
catching and knotting and pulling each other, producing 
the eflfect known as "fulling." Twisting, wringing, or 
rubbing flannels vigorously also tends to entangle the 
little scales, and to give to the article nn unpleasant" di- 
versified surface. 

INEXPENSIVE AND DELIGHTFUL. 

"My! what a flowery whiff. That handkerchief must 
havfc been literally steeped in violets!" exclaimed one 
girl to another who had just shaken from its folds w fra- 
grant square of linen. 

"Not steeped in violets, my dear," was the answer, "Init 
boiled in orris water. The effect is the same, so where's 
the odds? On washdays, I supply the laundress with a 
good-sized piece of orris root, and she throws it into the 
water where my handkerchiefs are boiling. When they 
come up off of the ironing board they are as redolent of 
orris as can be. Then I slip them between the folds of a 
sachet fifled with violet powder, and they never lose their 
fragrance. Violet and orris scent together, I've dk- 
eoversd, can make a real violet's odor faint with envy."

The Carpet Bug (Anthienus Scrophulanjc) or Buffalo 
Bug, as it is sometimes called, was first noticed in the 
city of BvifTalo, New York. 

The grub which does the damage is about one-fourtii 
of an inch in length. It is covered with hair as shown in 
the above illustration a, b. It spins no cocoon like the 
caterpillar, but when full grown the skin spli:s on the back 
and shows the insect. A few weeks later the skin burst.s 
again, and the perfect little bug, as shown in a, appear;. 
It is marked with red, black and white spots and is less 
than one-eighth of an inch in length.

Protection Against Moths. 






.'III! !^ 



THE COMMON MOTH. 

In May the clothes-moth begins to fly about our rooms. 
It is a small, light, buff-colored "miller," dainty and beauti- 
ful on close inspection. Its highest mission seems to be 
to teach us to set our affections only upon incorruptible 
treasures which "moth and rust cannot destroy." But it 
is necessary to keep a sharp lookout f6r the safety of our 
furs and flannels, and we must wage war upon it. In 
the first place, we must carefully put away everything we 
can, upon which it will lay its eggs. If we pack away our 
furs and flannels early in May, before the moth has begun 
to lay its eggs, and leave them in boxes and bags so tight 
that the flying moth cannot squeeze in, no further pre- 
caution is necessary. Clean paper bags are recommended 
for this purpose — those used for flour and meal bags. 
They should be without holes or opening anywhere. These 
bags, when filled and closed firmly, may be put away 
on closet shelves or in loose boxes, without danger to their 
contents, so far as moths are concerned, without need of 
camphor or other strong odors to drive the moths away. 
Furs are usually sold in boxes in which they may be kept. 
Beat them well when you finally put them away for the 
season. If you delay putting them away until June, ex- 
amine the furs well, and shake and beat them thoroughly, 
in order that any moth eggs that may possibly have been 
laid in them may be thoroughly removed or killed. Furs 
sealed up early in May need no camphor or tobacco or 
other preventive. Muff and tippet boxes should be tied 
up securely in bags, or made safe by mending holes and 
pasting a strip of paper around the juncture of the cover 
with the box below, so as to close all openings. Woolen 
garments must not hang in closets through the summer, 
in parts of the country where moths abound. They should 
be packed away in tight trunks or boxes, or sealed up in 
bags. Woolen blankets must be well shaken and carefully 
put away, unless they are in daily use. Early in June 
the larvae of the moth begin their ravages, and then, un- 
less you dwell in places where moths are not found, look 
sharp, or you will find some precious thing, that you 
have forgotten — some good coat unused for a few weeks, 
or the woolen cover of a neglected piano — already riddled 
by the voracious moths. It is their nature to eat until 
they have grown strong enough to retire from the eating 
business^ and go into the chrysalis condition,

lowing sweet-smelling things: Lavender, thyme, rose, 
cedar shavings, powdered sassafras, cassia, and lignea in 
about equal ciuantities, with a few drops of attar of roses 
tijrown upon the whole. 

Tausy Leaves, spread freely among woolens and furs, 
are a protection against moths. 

Turpentine is an excellent preventive against moths, 
although naphtha is preferable, the odor leaving much 
sooner; it will drive ants and cockroaches away, if sprin- 
kled about the shelves and cupboards. 

Whole Cloves are now used to exterminate moths, and 
some say they are much better than tobacco, camphor, 
or cedar shavings. 

The Best Preventive of moths is care. Cedar chests, 
camphor, and pepper avail nothing if a garment is laid 
away with the egg of the moth in it. If it is, in season, 
shut up in paper or cloth so that no millers can possibly 
reach it, there will be no need of pungent odors. Ben- 
zine is the best remedy if the moths have stolen a march 
and are ravaging carpets or furniture. Pour it freely upon 
ajiy carpet or upholstered furniture and it will not stain. 

The BulTalo Moths, the most destructive of all house- 
hold foes, try equal quantities of borax, camphor, and 
saltpetre, mixed. Wash the floor with a strong solution 
of it, and scatter it under the edge of the carpet and in 
your closets and drawers. The beetle that lays the eggs 
comes early in February and then the fight must begin. 
Naphtha is considered an efficient remedy, but it must be 
repeatedly used in order to destroy each successive gener- 
ation. 



HOW TO GET RID AND KEEP RID OF BEDPUGS. 

1. The eggs of the bedbug are white in color and oval 
in shape. The young resemble the parents, and it takes 
about eleven weeks to get its full growth. Like reptiles, 
they can live many years without food. Mr. Goeze, of 
Germany, has kept them six years in a bottle without a 
particle of nourishment of any kind. 

2. Keeping the bedding and bedstead perfectly clean is 
the best preventive. • 

3. Remedy. — Pour hot water into the crevices and then 
apply benzine to the dififerent parts of the bedstead.

OTHER REMEDIES. 

1. Cayenne pepper sprinkled in cupboards and store- 
rooms will drive away ants and cockroaches. The pepper 
ought to be fresh and strong and very fine. 

2. Black ants can be put to rout by washing shelves or 
floors whereon they congregate with hot water in which 
some ammonia has been dissolved. 

3. Take five cents' worth of tartar emetic, mix it with 
an equal amount, in bulk, of soft or granulated sugar, put 
the mixture into dishes, keep it moist (quite moist), and 
set the dishes, one on each shelf where the ants appear, 
they will promptly take their departure. I do not know 
what becomes of them, but they are gone. I never find 
dead ones, either in the dishes or on the shelves. When 
not needed the dishes can dry out and be put away to be 
wet again for the next time. 

4. You will find a most effectual remedy for the ant 
by mixing honey and insect powder and setting in shal- 
low pan so that easy access may be had. The ants will 
come and partake in great numbers, never to return. 

5. This is an effectual remedy for ants: In the center of 
a shallow dish put a very little Paris green, and on it a 
spoonful of honey— then pour in half a cupful of water. 
Set in their trail, and in a few days they will be gone. 
It is possible they will come again in a few weeks, but 
the second dose is effectual. 

6. A sure way to keep the little common black ants 
out of food is to set the food on a board as large as de- 
sired, which is isolated by supporting the four corners in 
little tins of common insect powder. I drive a nail in each 
corner, letting it project say an inch, so as to form four 
legs, which I surround with insect powder either on the 
shelf itself or in little tin can covers which prevent the 
powder from getting brushed away. I never knew this 
plan to fail. A table or a cupboard may have its legs 
stand in dishes of powder. Borax, salt, kerosene, etc., are 
of no account in most cases. The kerosene soon evaporates 
and they will crawl right over the others. Pepper and 
camphor would be objectionable to have about. It's well 
enough to shoot powders into places like cracks where 
they come in, if you can find them and are willing to hava

How to. Get Rid of Rats and Mice. 



|! 




A Sure Remedy. — It docs not pay to try to raise rats 
and chicks in the same place; yet it is nearly impossible 
to keep the former down when farm buildings offer con- 
venient hiding places. Various plans have been devised 
for dealing with this pest, with only partial success. A 
good method to get rid of a few rats is to slit a piece of 
fresh meat and fill it with powdered glass. Rats are very 
fond of wheat, and we have been quite successful with 
this method: Take 25 cents' worth of strychnine and dilute 
it with a cup of water (a quart bottle is a good article to 
use for this purpose). After the poison is dissolved add 
a few handfuls of wheat; set in a warm place, and when 
the wheat is swelled as much as possible scatter it in and 
around the rat-holes, or where the rats go. It is sure death 
to rats, cats, chicks or man. Be careful how you use it. 




A SURE CURE FOR THE EXTERMINATION OF MICE. 

I. The best and most careful trapper of mice will 
find great difficulty in capturing the shrewder and older 
ones. They simply will not go into a trap. The best 
method for capturing those is illustrated in the above cut. 
Take a small box and fill it with brick or stones, and 
place under it a figure 4, baited with cheese, meat, or 
other attractive food, and as the box comes down it will 
destroy the sharpest and shrewdest mouse. By this 
method it is not difficult to keep rid of mice in any house. 
2. Fill a sewing thimble with any eatable, as bread 
crumbs, pressed down tightly. Place the thimble under 
the edge of a good-sized bowl, with the open end inward. 
The mouse will nibble at the bread and the thimble will 
gradually work down and the mouse will be caught. The 
bowl should be put upon a loose board. The mouse can 
then easily be disprf.tched. This may seem too simple to 
try, but is very effective. 



low you use it.

improved of late. Select the new blue-flowered and ths 
faucy sorts, which are magniticcnt in the latest strains. 
Outside plant a ring of nasturtiums. Better take the dwarf 
Sorts, if you do not have abundant room. This is the 
finest annual in existence, sweet, floriferous, and elegant. 
Next plant a mixed ring, made up of patcher of mignon- 
ette, dwarf convolvulus and verbenas. If that doesn't 
make you happy, nothing will. 

SWEET PEAS. 

Sweet Peas have become so universally popular that 
all who have the ground wish to grow their own sweet 
peas; and there is no reason why they should not 
grow them and have glorious success with them, too, if 
they will observe a few simple rules. First — Order your 
seeds from some reliable seedsmen, and not from the 
corner grocery, and then get them into the ground as 
early as possible in the spring. Select a sunny spot and 
run your rows from north to south, so that the morning 
sun can get at the roots. The soil should be moderately 
rich and heavy, and if you neglected in the fall to dig in 
a liberal dressing of manure, you must have especial care 
now that only that which is well rotted be used. Sow your 
seed about an inch apart and cover to a depth of not 
less than four inches. When they have peeped above the 
ground two inches or so, draw the earth up about them 
until only the tips are still showing, and later thin them 
out until they stand three inches apart. 

Where there is plenty of ground, the rows should be 
single and not less than four feet apart, but where econ- 
omy of space is a consideration the rows may be double 
and the seed sown in two lines, from six to twelve inches 
apart. The trellis for the plants to grow on should be 
six feet high. Wire netting is good, but no better than 
the cheaper bush supports of beech or birch branches. 

Follow these directions, and when your sweet peas 
begin to bloom give them plenty of water and keep every 
blossom picked, and you will have sweet peas that will 
be a joy from June till September. 

Don't expect sweet peas to thrive in soil too poor for 
any other culture, or in a sunless location. They need, 
as nearly as possible, a free clay loam, moderately rich and 
freely cultivated. 

Don't sow too shallow. ' Plant the seeds not less than 
two inches deep, and, as the plants become established, 



j-flowered and th»

512 The Enemies of the Farm and Garden, 




HOW TO DESTROY CURRANT AND GOOSE- 
BERRY WORMS. 

Take a tablespoonful of hellebore and stir it into a pail 
of water, and apply to the bushes with a sprinkler. One 
or two applications will generally be sufficient. A little 
care in watching the bushes is necessary. The worms 
generally begin at the bottom, and are not noticed until 
the bush is nearly destroyed. 

HOW TO DESTROY PLANT-LICE. 

There is scarcely a tree, bush or herb that grows in our 
gardens or fields, that is not infested with some specic< 
of plant-lice. Their manner of living, and of reproduction, 
have attracted much interest. They both deposit their eggs 
and bring forth their young alive, a peculiarity which does 
not take place in any of our four-winged insects. Their 
multiplication is immense, and were it not for their numer 
ous enemies, all our vegetable products would be con- 
sumed as fast as they grow. 

Remedy. When the plant-lice g§t too numerous take a 
little flour of sulphur, and mix it with a little sawdust, 
and scatter ^it ovcf the plants.

514 Practical Rules for Keeping Poultry. 

for breeders. The males are unable to properly fertilize 
eggs for hatching, while the stock is usually weak. Four 
years is generally considered a "ripe old age" for a fowl. 

10. Each hen, if properly kept, will lay from 200 to 250 
eggs a year. 

11. Liver and intestines are an excellent food to make 
hens lay. 

12. Keep an abundant supply of lime where the hens 
can easily get at it if you desire your hens to lay well. 

13. Always clean the nest well and put in fresh straw 
before the hen begins to set. 

14. It is best in breeding to cross or mix the breeds 
more or less every year. It improves the flesh and gen- 
eral health of the fowls. 

15. Pullets are better layers than old hens. Keep your 
stock young by disposing annually of the old broods. 

16. Keep at least one rooster for every eight hens if

GAFES. 

The Gapes is a very common ailment of poultry and 
domestic birds. ]\Iore common among the young than 
the old. 

Cause.— The disease is caused by the presence of little 
red worms, in the wind-pipe, about the size of a small 
cambric needle. 

Symptoms.— Gaping for breath with beak wide open, 
yellow beak, tongue dry and feathers ruffled on the head 
and neck. 

Treatment. — Give a pill each morning made of equal 
parts of scraped garlic and horse radish, with as much 
cayenne pepper as will outweigh a grain of wheat; mix 
with fresh butter. 

If a good many are affected, put from five to ten drops 
of turpentine to a pint of meal. 

Treatment must be given in the early stages of the dis- 
ease, or all remedies will fail. 




HOW TO DESTROY AND KEEP RID OF HEN'S LICE. 

All fowls are more or less infested with lice. Fowls are 
sometimes so covered that the natural color of the feath- 
ers can not be distinguished. These loathsome vermin 
will not only cover the fowls, but will multiply and spread 
over the entire hen-house, barn, wood-shed or any other 
place frequeniied by the poultry. 

Poultry cannot be fattened when covered with lice. 

1. Remedy. — Whitewash the hen-house frequently, white- 
wash all the roostingf poles, etc., or run them slowly 
through a fire of old straw or hay. 

2. Close the hen-house up tightly and burn sulphur in it. 
The sulphur fumes will penetrate every crevice and de- 
stroy the vermin. 

3. Flour of sulphur may be mixed with Indian meal and 
water, and be fori in the proportion of one pound of sul- 
phur to two dozen fowls, every two days. 

4. Applying grease of any kind by rubbing it among 
the feathers is certain death to the vermin. 

5. Remove droppings daily and keep the house clean 
and you will not be troubled with these pests.

of the egg will get watery, if too much it will stick on the 
outside like plaster, and be difficult to remove. 

7. A faucet should be fitted into the barrel about six 
inches from the bottom, so that the pickle can be drawn 
off when necessary. 

8. A common method for small quantities: Take a box 
or half barrel and first put in a layer of common salt, and 
then a layer of eggs, and so on, until the desired quantity 
is packed.

5. A market report gives quotations on eggs that are 
described as "Western dirties." It is a commentary upon 
the habits of certain farmers that their careless methods 
nave to be branded in the market reports. 

6. If when an egg became dirty it was an impossibility to 
clean It the matter would be diflferent, but all that i« re- 
quired IS a little warm water and a littlt time. 

7. It was also noteworthy that while fresh clean eccs 
were quoted by the dozen, and at a good price, yet the

was too low to bother with giving it for a single dozen.
