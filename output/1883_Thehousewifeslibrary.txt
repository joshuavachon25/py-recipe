PREFACE. 



HOUSEWIFE is in many repeats a better word than 
housekeeper. One may keep house in a cold and per- 
functory style. A housekeeper may be a mere hire- 
ling, with no interest whatever in the establishment beyond 
the wages drawn from it. But a housewife is one wedded to 
the house and its interests. She is not a slave to the house, 
as a wife is not a slave to her husband ; but both love the 
object of their espousal, and labor with supreme regard for 
the best good of that object. For those who thus love 
home this book has been prepared. 

All persons are not housewives nor yet housekeepers, biit 
all are presumed to dwell in houses. These houses are kept 
by somebody, and the manner in which they are kept very 
materially affects the happiness of those who dwell therein. 
Therefore, all persons have a direct interest in whatever will 
help housekeepers, to keep house in better style and to 
make the household more healthy and more happy. 

Some helps are hindrances. They are so hard to grasp, 
and when grasped they are so hard to handle, and when 
handled they afford so little in return, and what they do 
afford is so worthless that, though they be helps in name 
and in aim, yet in fact they are hindrances only. This book 
is not of that class. Whatever will render genuine assist- 
ance has been secured for it, regardless of cost or toil. 
What would be useless in such a book has been rejected, 
however attractive it seemed. It is believed that every 
housewife will find nothing here to neglect, but much to 
use and profit by.

iv FKEFACE. 

Many books are epitomized in this. Cooking, Furnish, 
ing, Management, Etiquette, Games, Emergencies, Care of 
Children, and every other desirable domestic topic, on 
which volumes have been written, find treatment here. It 
is indeed a Housewife's Library. It furnishes " many 
volumes in one." 

Its contents are arranged for ready reference. In the 
pages immediately following, this appears at a glance. All 
that is contained in the book is there summarized. The nine 
departments are believed to cover every phase of the house- 
wife's wants. A full 'index has been added also. The reader 
need not pause to locate a topic in the Table of Contents, 
but he will be guided at once to its treatment by reference 
to the index pages. Quick and certain access to what the 
book contains is thus assured. 

Nor is it a mere recipe book. It does not simply tell 
what to do and how to act ; it seeks to build from the foun- 
dation laid deeply in the nature of things. There are good 
and sufficient reasons for most of the customs of society. 
He who understands these, catches the spirit of the whole 
matter and cannot get far astray, even though he be ignor- 
ant of the exact letter of the law. 

J, Illustrations have been freely employed because of their 
undoubted helpfulness. But the plan of making the language 
of the book so plain that all obscurity may be dispelled has 
been steadily adhered to. It is both complete and clear. 

The Housewives of America aspire to the best things in 
their homes. This Library will prove a splendid helper to 
their progress.

There is no horizontal Stratification of society in this country like the rocks 
in the earth, that hold one class down below forevermore, and let another 
come to the surface to stay there forever. Our Stratification is like the ocean, 
where every individual drop is free to move, and where from the sternest 
depths of the mighty deep any drop may come up to glitter on the highest 
wave that rolls,

FIRST DEPAI^TMENT, 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



Oh ! better no doubt is a dinner of herbs, 
When season'd by love, which no rancor disturbs. 
And sweeten'dby all that is sweetest in life 
Than turbot, bisque, ortolans, eaten in strife I 
But if out of humor, and hungry, alone 
A man should sit down to dinner, eacu one 
Of the dishes of which the cook chooses to spoil 
With a horrible mixture of garlic and oil. 
The chances are ten gainst one, I must own. 
He gets up as ill-tempered as when he sat down. 

Owen Meredith. 



Domestic Cookery. 



THERE is a beautiful legend that tells how Elizabeth of 
Hungary, having been forbidden by her lord to carry 
food to the poor, was met by him one day outside the 
castle walls as she was bearing a lapful of meat and bread 
to her pensioners. Louis demanding sternly what she car- 
ried in her robe, she was obliged to show him the forbidden 
burden. " Whereupon," says the chronicler, " the food was 
miraculously changed, for his eyes, to a lapful of roses, 
red and white, and his mind disabused of suspicion, he gra- 
ciously bade her pass on withersoever she would." 

It would be well for some husbands if " their eyes were 
holden " in such a way that food served them would seem 
other and better than it really is. But the sense of taste is 
a rebellious member — especially in the men. It will cry out 
against the best appearing dish, if its flavor is not of the 
best. There is but one way to sure success. The house- 
wife herself must be the angel who casts the spell about the 
humble board and the lowly fare, and invests them with 
forms and odors of irresistible attractiveness. This is the 
true poetry of Domestic Cookery; and blessed is the 
home where one presides who knows this art, and makes 
each meal a feast, and every guest a glad participant. 

15 



16 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

But things do not always take so happy a form. For 
instance : there was recently a brutal murder in Troy, N. Y., 
and a paper, reporting the case, clumsily said : " A poor 
woman was killed yesterday in her own home, while cooking 
her husband's breakfast in a shocking manner." Quoting 
this statement, a contemporary remarked : " There are 
many women who cook their husbands' breakfasts in a 
shocking manner, but it is seldom that justice overtakes 
them so summarily." The subject is a serious one to joke 
over, but the turn given by the commenting paper is bright 
and suggestive. 

The fact is, that by skillful manipulation the plainest fare 
may be transformed into dishes fit for kings, while by igno- 
rance and inattention the best viands may be rendered unfit 
for human food. Which turn should housewives attempt to 
give their own culinary affairs ? There can . be but one 
reply. But, be it remembered, that freaks of favoring for- 
tune, such as came to Elizabeth, come only to those who 
are zealously pursuing the line of helpful duty. There is 
no royal road to success as a housekeeper or a cook. You 
must " work your passage," but the way will be smoothed 
by careful study of pages such as follow, provided the study 
take shape in wise action. 

Remember, too, that the ministry of Domestic Cookery 
is by no means an unimportant one. It is worthy of the 
best attention of any housewife. 

" The stomach," says an eminent medical authority, " is 
the mainspring of our system ; if it be not sufficiently wound 
up to warm and support the circulation, the whole business 
of life will, in proportion, be ineffectually performed ; we can 
neither think with precision, walk with vigor, sit down with 
comfort, nor sleep with tranquility. There would be no 
difficulty in proving that it influences (much more than 
people imagine) all our actions." Dyspepsia is a fearful foe 
to the human race. 



I.— THE ART OF COOKING. 

THERE is a science and there is an art of cooking. The 
science tells what should be done and why ; the art takes 
hold and does the thing, without, in most cases, knowing 
any reason why certain methods produce certain results. 
The one is theoretical, the other practical ; the one deals 
with principles, the other with performances. 

The science of cookery proceeds on the basis that man 
needs certain elements of repair and growth for the various 
tissues of his body, that these elements exist in nature in 
various farms, and that the mission of the cook is so to 
prepare these suitable substances that man may receive 
them in their most enjoyable and assimilable forms, and thus 
have his waste repaired and his growth provided for. This 
basis is solid. On it the whole culinary system is founded. 
But, from the merely utilitarian idea of repairing waste and 
supplying force, cookery rises to the supreme height of 
exquisitely delighting the taste while doing its most impor- 
tant work of feeding the body. Indeed, the art of cooking 
well, and of serving well-cooked victuals well, is " a fine art " 
in the best sense of the term. There are artistes in 
this line. Meals may be served artistically. They may 
become a delight to the most refined natures and a real 
benefaction to both body and soul. 

The great aim of all cooking is to retain all the valuable 
elements of the food, and to put them into such forms as 
shall awake desire, stimulate digestion, and secure to the 
eater, in the readiest and most pleasing way, all the nutriment 
these viands afford. For instance, in cooking meats it is 
desirable to retain all the natural juices. To this end, when 
meat is to be boiled it should be plunged into hot water, 
which at once renders the outer part measurably impenetra- 
2 17 



18 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ble, ana so confines the juices. On the other hand, if the 
juices are to be drawn out for the production of soup, it 
must be placed in cold water, and gradually warmed and 
slowly boiled, so as to allow the exudation of the juices. 
On the same principle, broiling and roasting, by quickly clos- 
ing the surface of the meat, retain the juices as well as the 
odors, and make the meat both juicy and savory. The re- 
tention of the fatty substances .renders such preparations 
somewhat less digestible, however, than boiled food or lean 
meat. 

High art in cookeiy, as elsewhere, demands high rates of 
expenditure. Instructions on that grade alone would not 
meet the want of American homes. But high aims in this 
department are equally commendable with high aims else- 
where. So important a factor in domestic economy as cook- 
ing cannot be ignored and should not be treated lightly. 
Good food, well cooked and well served, goes far to make 
home happy and its inmates healthy. 

The chemical aspect of food and cooking may be left to 
the chemist and the physiologist. They will perfect the 
scientific aspects of the case. But the art of cooking, which 
teaches just how and when to do the right things, is for us 
to learn and to practice day by day. Such is the relation of 
stomach and brain on the one side, and of stomach and 
cook on the other side, that the cook becomes the sov- 
ereign, to whom many a brain mightier than his own 
bows in servile allegiance. 

■ What cookery was practiced in the garden of Eden his- 
tory does not tell. Vegetarians insist that permission to 
eat animal food was not given until after the flood (Genesis 
xi, 3, 4), when, by indulgence, man's appetites had become 
abnormal. If vegetable food only were used in Eden, and 
that mainly of the nature of fruits, but little cooking was 
needed, and the simplest forms would suffice amply. Ancient 
writers say that cooking came into use immediately on the

discovery of fire, whenever that was, and that its introduc- 
tion was in imitation of the natural processes of mastication 
and digestion. 

The first reference of the Bible to cooked food is to "a mor- 
sel of bread " (Genesis xviii, 5). Sarah, in this instance, made 
ready " three measures of fine meal," which she kneaded, 
and of which she made cakes " upon the hearth." These 
were, doubtless, the simplest form of unleavened cakes,

flattened thin and baked upon a hot stone. A tender calf 
was hastily dressed on this occasion also, but whether by 
boiling or stewing, by roasting on a hot stone or by broil- 
ing over the fire on the point of a stick, is not known. Cer- 
tainly, the whole dressing required but little time and was 
not very elaborate. For these same guests Lot baked un- 
leavened bread, and, as the record is, " he made them a 
feast," quite hurried and simple, no doubt. 

When Abraham's servant, searching for a wife for Isaac, 
reached her father's house, " they did eat and drink," un-- 
questionably in a festive way. Isaac was so fond of veni- 
son that he bacame unduly partial to his son Esau, who 
excelled as a hunter in capturing game for this dish. The 
preparation of the meat was in some elaborate style, which 
Isaac denominated " savory meat," and the eating of it so 
pleased him that he spoke of it as the meat " that I love," 
and asked it " that I may eat, and that my soul may bless

thee before I die." Irreverent critics may say this was man- 
like, but reverent ones will pronounce it quite human, and 
all may conclude that cookery was taking attractive shapes 
in that early day. So Esau thought, undoubtedly, upon see- 
ing his brother Jacob with a pottage of red lentiles. He was 
willing to sell out his birthright, with all its high preroga- 
tives, that he might eat of this tempting dish. All these in- 
cidents from the book of Genesis indicate that punctuality 
at the table and systematic forethought for its proper service 
were undeveloped arts at that time. Many later Biblical 
references indicate a higher state of culture in these respects, 
sumptuous fare and great feasts being matters of frequent 
reference. In the ceremonial law many directions were given 
concerning the killing and the cooking of animal food. 

Ovens are often mentioned in the Bible. In the cities and 
villages they were located generally in the establishments 
of bakers (Hosea vii, 4), or in large private establishments. 
Portable ovens were used by many who lived in a nomadic 
way. The portable oven was a large earthen jar, widening 
at the bottom, and having a side opening there by which to 
extract the ashes and to insert the bread 
or meat. These are referred to as the 
possession of every family, in Exodus 
viii, 3 ; though in time of destitution, or 
scarcity of fuel, one oven answered for 
many families, as Leviticus xxvi, 26. 
shows. These ovens could be hastily 
heated by a quick fire of twigs, grasses, 
etc., which fuel suggested the reference

is in the field and to-morrow is cast into 
the oven. Loaves or meat were placed inside, and thin 
cakes upon the outside of these ovens. 

The remote East, the land of spices, was the first to 
develop cookery in its higher ranges. Carefully wrpught 




THE ART OF COOKING. 21 

and highly seasoned dishes were first prepared there. Many- 
curious notions are recorded of the various nations in re- 
spect to food and cooking. The universal custom in Oriental 
lands is to cook meat as soon as killed. It never becomes 
cold, as with us. Goose is a great favorite with the Egyp- 
tians. Plutarch says only one class of this nation would 
eat mutton, and at Thebes it was wholly prohibited. Pud- 
dings made from the blood of slaughtered animals were 
favored by Egyptians but hated by Moslems. Egyptians 
never ate the head of any animal. Pastry among them was 
worked into the shapes of animals, and was always sprinkled 
with caraway and anise. 

The Greeks esteemed cookery so highly, that royal per- 
sonages took pride in preparing their own meals. Homer's 
poems contain many illustrations of such service. 
Achilles once personally served up a great feast, its special 
feature being that smaller meats were garnished with 
entrails of oxen. It was common at great feasts of the 
Greeks to dedicate certain dishes to certain gods, and then 
to eat them in honor of those gods. 

In the time of Pericles a class of professional cooks had 
come into prominence who boasted that they could serve 
up a whole pig, boiled on one side, roasted on the other, 
stuffed with cooked birds, eggs, and other delicacies, and 
yet the whole so neatly done that it could not be discovered 
where the animal had been opened. Invention was then 
taxed to invent a new cake, or a new sauce, and he who did 
it was deemed worthy of high honor. One Greek distin- 
guished himself by devising a new method of curing hams ; 
another devised a cake which took his name and made him 
famous. In Athenian dishes, assafoetida was a popular 
ingredient, as were rue and garlick. 

To compound one famous dish, certain uninviting parts of 
sows, asses, hawks, seals, porpoises, star-fish, etc., were 
used. One visitor to Greece, having eaten a celebrated 



22 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

" black broth," said he had learned why the Spartans were 
in battle so fearless of death, as the pains of death were 
preferable to existence on such abominable food. A Greek 
poet, Archistratus, traveled the world over to study the 
gastronomic art, and then wrote a poem, " Gastrology," 
which became the standard among Greek epicures. Greek 
cooks took special pride in so flav6ring and disguising com- 
mon fish and meat, that epicures even would be deceived by 
their preparations. 

Roman cooking surpassed the Grecian in the more solid 
dishes, until the decline of the Empire began, when Roman 
epicures and gluttons came to the front and soon surpassed 
the world. Fishes, birds, and wines were their chief delica- 
cies, and to secure those of rarest quality the known world 
was laid under contribution. There is record of a single 
feast at which were served peacocks from Samos, chickens 
from Phrygia, kids from Melos, cranes from ^Etolia, tunny 
fishes from Chalcedon, pikes from Pessinus, oysters from 
Tarentum, mussels from Chios, dates from Egypt, and inci- 
dentals from as many more points. Snails were fattened 
for table uses till their shells would contain a quart ; fishes 
and birds were fed on the choicest dainties to prepare them 
for human food, while even hogs were fattened on whey 
and dates. 

Lucullus was in the habit of spending fifty thousand 
denarii (about eight thousand dollars) on each of his sump- 
tuous feasts. Galba's daily breakfasts were each of sufficient 
cost to feed a hundred families. Vitellius made a single 
dish of pheasants' brains, peacocks' brains, nightingales' 
tongues, and livers of the rarest fishes. Its cost was one 
thousand sesterces (about forty thousand dollars). On 
another occasion two thousand choice fishes and * seven 
thousand rare birds were served by him. It is said his 
kitchen expenses for four months amounted to twenty-five 
million dollars.

Heliogabalus had a favorite dish for his own suppers 

made from the brains of six hundred thruslies. Porlv was 
the choice Roman disli at a later day. It was often served 
in the famous style already referred to, beuig half baked,

was then baked while the lower lay imbedded in a thick

was then removed and the lower side boiled in a shallow 
saucepan.

Cooking utensils were elaborately made for the homes of 
the rich. The finest grades were made of bronze, and 
usually they were plated with silver. Some articles were 
of brass, others even of silver. Kitchens were royal apart- 
ments then, many of them having marble floors and being 
decorated with costly paintings. Even the aspirations of

our modem " help " would have been gratified fully by the 
kitchen appointments of those days. Schools of cookery, 
under the most accomplished professional care, were nu- 
merous at that time. 

One of the most princely pieces of extravagance ever 
brought out by good cooking was in the case of Antony. 
When Cleopatra praised a repast he furnished, Antony at 
once called the cook and presented him with a city. An- 
other piece of extravagance was when LucuUus entertained

Cicero and Pompey. They three partook of a little feast 
which cost not less than five thousand dollars. Geta in- 
sisted on as many courses at his state dinners as there were 
letters in the alphabet, and each course was required to 
contain every viand known, the name of which began with 
that letter. Alexander the Great once entertained ten 
thousand guests, all of whom were seated at the tables at 
one time, and in silver chairs upholstered with purple. Pos- 
sibly the most extensive "spread" ever made was by the 
Earl of Warwick when his brother was installed Arch-

bishop of York in 1479. The record of its appointments is 
as follows : 300 quarters of wheat, 300 tuns of ale, 104 tuns 
of wine, i pipe of spiced wine, 10 fat oxen, 6 wild bulls, 300 
pigs, 1,004 sheep, 300 hogs, 3,000 calves, 300 capons, 100 
peacocks, 200 cranes, 200 kids, 2,000 chickens, 4,000 pig- 
eons, 4,000 rabbits, 4,000 ducks, 204 bitterns, 400 herons, 
200 pheasants, 500 partridge, 5,000 woodcocks, 400 plovers, 
100 curlews, lOO quails, 100,000 eggs, 200 roes, 4,000 roe- 
bucks, 155 hot venison pasties and 4,000 of them cold, 
1,000 dishes of jellies, 2,000 hot custards and 4,000 of them 
cold, 400 tarts, 300 pikes, 300 bream, 8 seals, and 4 por- 
poises. The Earl in person was steward; 1,000 servitors, 
62 chief cooks, and 515 under cooks and scullions offi- 
ciated on this monster occasion. 

After the fifth century it is said that " cookery, like learn- 
ing, retired into convents." For several centuries religious 
houses alone were the abodes of good cooking. In the 
tenth century the art reappeared among the wealthier citizens 
of Italy. Discoveries of new countries and the increasing 
activity of commerce continually enlarged the iield for gas- 
tronomic delights. Italy, the leader in fine cookery in those 
days, began to send her methods and her cooks into France, 
where they received a hearty welcome from Catharine de 
Medici and her royal spouse. Under these fostering im- 
pulses several cities became famous for specialties in food ; 
Hamburg, for example, for hams, Strasburg for sausages, 
Amsterdam for herrings, Ostend for oysters, Chartres for 
pies, etc., etc. 

The ancient Britons and Saxons knew none of the refine- 
ments of the culinary art. Their meal was simple bruised 
barley ; their meat, half-cooked game. The Danes did 
more at drinking than at eating, at brewing than at baking. 
The Normans, however, introduced the better styles of food 
and the cook again loomed up grandly. So great was 
the excess of these times that the friars of St. Swithin's com- 



THE ART OF COOKING. 27 

plained to King Henry II that three of their thirteen regu- 
lar dinner courses had been withheld from them by their 
abbot. Cranmer ordered, in 1541, that archbishops should 
be limited to six dishes of meat daily, bishops to five, and 
lower orders of clergy to four, or three in certain cases. 
The poultry to be used was also limited, and the fish. 

After the Crusades the higher classes of England imitated 
the luxurious methods they had learned abroad. Peacocks be- 
came a favorite dish. They were usually served with the 
tail feathers remaining and spread to their fullest extent. In 
the reign of Elizabeth cooks reached the zenith of their 
power, many classical scholars willingly espousing this pro- 
fession. 

The early inhabitants of France subsisted chiefly on roots 
and acorns. After their subjugation by Caesar they quickly 
took on the Roman methods, and later the Norman methods, 
until in the fourteenth century they produced Taillevant, 
the greatest cook of history. In the reign of Louis' XII a 
company was chartered to make sauces and another to cook 
meats on the spit. These were the days when fancy cook- 
ing ran toward the impossible. Eggs cooked on the spit, 
butter fried, roasted, etc., were the surprising delicacies 
produced by the masters of gastronomy. 

In the days of Louis XIV cookery in France was at its 
height of sumptuousness. A reaction in favor of modera- 
tion then began to prevail. Cooks were out of employment. 
Restaurants then appeared under their care, and they soon 
found abundant patronage. Careme, of France, is con- 
fessedly the greatest of modern French cooks. He has 
exalted the science of cookery while he has nobly advanced 
the art. 

There are several national or provincial dishes which are 
well known; for example, the roast beef and plum pudding 
of England ; the sauerkraut of Germany ; the salt beef of 
Holland ; the pillau of Turkey (made of rice and mutton 



28 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

fat) ; the macaroni of Italy ; the potatoes of Ireland ; tha 
oat-meal of Scotland ; the pork and beans and the pumpkin 
pie of New England. 

Books on the science and the art of cookery are 
numerous. The oldest dates from the last half of the four- 
teenth century. It is from a Frenchman, Le Sage, who has 
blended moral maxims and culinary recipes in a wonderful 
manner. The next in order is from Taillevant, already 
referred to, dated 1 392. Scappi, chief cook to Pope Pius 
V, published a valuable book on cookery in 1 570. So have 
they been multiplied as the years have rolled by, and one 
who is not an expert in cookery cannot lay his defect at the 
door of authors or publishers. 

But books are not sufficient to elevate a people. There 
must be instruction, by which the text-books may be ex- 
pounded and their lessons be illustrated to the masses. The 
art of cookery must be learned, as are the other arts. There 
are those who say that domestic cooking should be learned 
in the home — that the mother should teach the daughters, 
and that skill and knowledge should thus be handed down 
from generation to generation. This is a splendid theory ; 
but if the mothers themselves are ignorant and unskillful, 
what then can be hoped for from the daughters ? Then, too, 
a fixed set of culinary traditions would be handed down in 
each family by this method, and the children would follow 
the ways of the parents, irrespective of better ways practiced 
by their next-door neighbors. 

In the face of these facts, it was not at all strange that 
schools of cookery arose centuries ago ; but it is strange 
that these schools were not extended in their scope, to in- 
clude others than professional cooks. They aimed merely 
to provide skilled help for the kitchens of royalty and 
wealth. This they did to perfection, but the common people 
knew nothing of the methods whereby their plain fare might 
be made more toothsome or more beneficial. It has re- 



THE ART OF COOKING. 29 

mained for this later day, this utilitarian age, to establish 
schools designed to furnish good, practical cooks for our 
homes, and to develop them from our wives and our 
daughters. 

This " cooking-school " movement arose in England. 
The working classes there were so sadly unskilled in 
using provision, and provision was so enormously costly, 
that the question necessarily arose. Is there no way where- 
by these masses can use what little they have to better ad- 
vantage ? How to make the most of what was in their 
kitchens was the practical problem. Schools of domestic 
economy then arose, under the patronage of benevolent per- 
sons, to promote the practical solution of this difficulty. 

The managers of the South Kensington Museum of Arts, 
in West London, made the first organized movement in this 
matter by establishing public lectures on the preparation of 
food, with platform demonstrations of various culinary 
operations. But the inadequacy of this course was soon evi- 
dent. Exposition and illustration were good, but practice 
was needed. Cookery is like music, in that the only way to 
do it well is to do it well. Lectures on the capabilities of 
the piano, though supplemented by brilliant illustration, 
could never make musicians, and the course inaugurated at 
Kensington Museum was not capable of making cooks. 
Practice schools soon became an admitted necessity. 

To found schools of this character was no easy task. 
Public sentiment was not up to the need. Teachers, textr 
books, and even pupils were wanting. It was unavoidably 
an expensive method of education, and no great names stood 
ready to back the movement. But the parties chiefly in- 
terested were determined, and they moved onward. The 
first organized classes for graded instructions and practice 
in cookery were formed in 1874. These classes were open 
to all, but especial encouragement was given to those pro- 
posing to go out as teachers of this art. In this respect tha 



30 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

work was a great success, and large numbers of cooking- 
schools have been formed in England. 

These schools employ a series of printed " lessons," 
suited for use in all the work in all the various grades. 
These lessons contained a list of ingredients needed for each 
dish, with their quantity and cost. Then followed a specifi- 
cation of the several steps to be taken, each distinct in itself 
and numbered. Nothing was assumed to be known; 
nothing was here taken for granted, all was clearly specified 
and, if need be, explained. As trial showed defects in the 
several lessons, they were carefully revised, and at last text- 
books were issued. Every pupil learned what to do in each 
case ; then they did it ; then they kept on doing it until they 
could do it to perfection. As at " Dotheboys Hall," he whose 
turn it was to spell " scrub " was set to scrub the floor, etc., 
etc., so at these practice schools, she who studied " Irish 
stew," made Irish stew, and capped the climax by eating it. 

It is surprising that so diversified a company gathered in 
these schools. An observer of the Kensington Museum 
establishment says of the attendance : " There were cultivated 
ladies, the daughters of country gentlemen, old house- 
keepers, servants, cooks, and colored girls from South 
Africa, together with a large proportion of intelligent young 
women who were preparing to become teachers." 

It may strike one who goes over these lessons that there 
is a wearisome attention. to trivial details. But it should not 
be forgotten that the chief difference between good and bad 
cookery lies just here. It is a prime point in cooking- 
schools to make each item so prominent that it cannot be 
overlooked. Strict attention to details is the corner-stone 
of the culinary art. 

Schools of cookery are now numerous in this country. 
New York, Philadelphia, and all the principal cities have 
institutions of this character. Text-books are numerous 
too. Eliza A. Youmans, Juliet Corson, and other ladies 



THE ART OF COOKING. ^\ 

have nobly led the van of culinary artistes, and their man- 
uals are standards for cooking-schools. 

To illustrate the method of the cooking-schools, two 
" lessons " are here added, both on the making of Cabinet 
Pudding. The first is from the American edition of Lessons 
in Cookery, the handbook of the London school. 

LESSON :— CABINET PUDDING. 

Ingredients. — One dozen cherries or raisins, and two or three pieces of 
angelica. One dozen iinger-biscuits and half a dozen rataRas. One ounce 
of loaf-sugar and fifteen drops of essence of vanilla. Four eggs. One 
pint of milk. 

Time required, about one hour. 
To make a Cabinet Pudding: 

1 . Take a pint-and-a-half mold and butter it inside with 
your fingers. 

2. Take a dozen raisins or dried cherries, and two or three 
pieces of angelica, and ornament the bottom of the mold with 
them. 

3. Take one dozen stale sponge finger-biscuits* and break 
them in pieces. 

4. Partly fill the mold with pieces of cake and a half a 
dozen ratafias.\ 

5. "Y^^ four yelks and two whites of eggs and put them 
in a basin. 

6. Add to the eggs one ounce of white sugar, and whip 
them together lightly. 

7. Stir in, by degrees, one pint of milk. 

8. Flavor it by adding fifteen drops of essence of vanilla. 

9. Pour this mixture over the cakes in the mold. 

10. Place a piece of buttered paper over the top of the 
mold. 

1 1. Take a saucepan half full of boiling water, and stand 

it on the side of the fire.

12. Stand the mold in the saucepan, to steam for from 
three-quarters of an hour to an hour. 

N. B. — The water should only reach half way up the mold, or it would 
bpil over and spoil the pudding. 

13. For serving, turn the pudding carefully out of the 
mold on to a hot dish." 

The other " lesson " is froni Miss Corson's Cooking- 
school Text-book. It is the method pursued in the New 
York Cooking-school and its offshoots.

THE ART OF COOKING. 33 

Every city has its leading caterer, who illustrates, when 
opportunity offers, to what heights the gastronomic art may 
be carried. On special occasions great " spreads " are made, 
the cost of which will surprise the uninitiated. From two 
to five dollars per plate is an ordinary charge for these en- 
tertainments. Ten dollars for each guest is by no means 
unusual. Twenty-five dollars for each guest, the wines in- 
cluded, is a price often charged, and Delmonico, of New 
York, furnished a dinner to ten persons, the cost of which 
was estimated to be no less than four hundred dollars each. 

The dinner was given by a distinguished yachting-man, 
who insisted that the five men in waiting should be dressed 
as sailors. He furnished the suits, new and elegant. The 
guests drank, or tasted, every vinted liquor that has ever been 
brought to America — not that they drank every brand of 
wine, but every grade was represented. They finished with 
&pousse cafe made of eleven liquors. 

The bills of fare were a striking feature of the display. 
Before each plate sat a cut-glass basin, about twenty inches 
in diameter and four inches deep. Each was nearly filled 
with water, perfumed with ottar of roses, on the surface of 
which floated half-open pond lilies. In the basin a perfect 
model of the yacht owned by the gentleman who gave the 
dinner was placed. It was cut in red cedar wood, with 
cabin, rail, wheel for steering, brass work, such as belaying- 
pins, binnacle, etc., man ropes worked and trimmed with 
sailor knots, scraped pine masts and booms, rigging of 
silken cords colored as it would be in the prototype, and 
sails of satin. 

The sails carried the bills of fare. On the flying jib were 

the words : " Compliments of ," naming the giver of 

the dinner; on the jib the date and place; on the foresail 
was the name of the guest who sat at the place where each 
little vessel floated ; and on the mainsail was the menu. As 
the guest had occasion to consult his bill of fare, he used a 
3

little gold oar that rested on the fingers of a silver naiad 
who peered over the containing glass,' and held out both 
hands to grasp the oar. After the dinner each guest either 
carried away his bill of fare or had it sent to his home. The 
bills of fare were supposed to have cost at least one hundred 
dollars apiece. Of course, the viands spread at such a table 
were the finest the markets of the world could afford. 

An artistic conclusion to an elaborate luncheon in New 
York is thus described by one who was there : " The last 
course was quite classic. A Greek would have appreciated it. 
It would have given him visions of Hybla and Hymettus, and 
their luxuriant growth of wild thyme. Everything was 
removed from the table except the ferns in the centre. A . 
glass jug, some small glasses, and a plate of water crackers 
were brought in. The hostess poured out for each guest a 
tiny glass of metheglin. Any one who had forgotten the 
old reputation of this liquor and of what it was made would 
have been enlightened by seeing the jug. It looked like a 
honeycomb. Through the wax-looking cells painted upon 
its surface the liquor appeared like yellow honey. On the 
, stopper was a black and gold bee. The caster, or tray, in 
which the jug stood was of glass also, covered with white 
clover and other heather flowers, which give the delicate 
flavor to Scotch and French honey. Such a finale seems to 
claim for America mention among those nations which 
Shakespeare describes as ' exquisite in their drinking.' " 



II.— SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS ON SOUP STOCK AND SOUP MEAT, HOW 
TO PREPARE THEM, HOW TO ENRICH THEM, THICKENING SOUP, 
COLORING SOUP, FLAVORING SOUP, ETC. THIRTY-TWO RECIPES 
FOR SOUPS AND INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

THE first and great essential to making good soup is 
stock, or good, fresh meat. To make stock, take the 
liquor left after boiling fresh meat, bones large or 
small, the large ones being cracked, that the marrow may- 
be extracted, trimmings of meat, bones, and meat left over 
from a roast or broil, put any or all of these in a large pot 
or soup-kettle with water enough to cover them. Let them 
simmer slowly over a steady fire, keep the kettle covered, 
stir frequently, pour in now and then a cup of cold water, 
and skim off the scum. If it is fresh meat or bones, com- 
mence with cold water ; if cooked, with warm water. Bones 
are as useful as meat in making stock, as they furnish gela- 
tine. A quart of water is usually enough for a pound of 
meat. Six to eight hours will make stock fit for use. Let 
it stand over night, then skim off the fat, put the stock into 
an earthen jar, and it is ready for use. 

Fresh meat should be freed from all superfluous skin and 
fat, which make a soup greasy, rather than rich. 

The glutinous substance contained in the bones renders it 
important that they should be boiled with the meat, as they 
add to the strength and thickness of the soup. The meat, 
however, should ,be cut off the bone and divided into small 
pieces. Place in cold water over a gentle fire and boil by 
the long and slow process, that the essence of the meat may

be drawn out thoroughly. When it comes to the boiling 
point, throw in a little salt to assist the scum to rise ; then 
skim carefully to prevent its becoming turbid. When no 
more scum accumulates, and the meat is softened so as to 
readily separate with the use of the fork, it should be 
strained, the vegetables put it, the seasoning done, and the 
necessary amount of hot water added if too much has boiled 
away. 

All soup meats are better boiled the day before using, so 
as to allow the grease to chill over night, when it can 
readily be removed before putting over the fire again. 

The following thickening is almost indispensable to all 
good soups : A tablespoonful or more of flour mixed to a 
smooth paste with a little water, and enriched with a tea- 
spoonful of butter, or good beef drippings well stirred in. 
If it be necessary to add water to a soup, always use boil- 
ing water, as cold water injures the flavor. If making a 
rich soup that requires catsup or wine, let either be added 
just before the soup is taken- from the fire. 

Soup may be colored yellow by the use of grated car- 
rots ; red with the juice of tomatoes ; green with the juice 
of powdered spinach ; brown with carefully scorched flour, 
kept ready for use. Onions are thought by many to be a 
necessity in all soups — that their flavor must lurk some- 
where, either defined or undefined. Their flavor may be 
much improved if fried until nicely browned in hot butter 
before being added to the soup. Potatoes should never 
be boiled with soup, because they add nothing to its flavor 
and are themselves injured by the long cooking. They 
should be boiled separately, and then added. 

A most desirable quality in soup is that no one flavor 
predominate over the others, but, that by a careful blending 
of the different ingredients it shall contain and harmonize 
all flavors. Soups and broths should always be strained. It

makes them more relishable as well as inviting to the eye. 
A slight acid, like lemon or tomato, gives a peculiar relish 
to some soups, as do many of the palatable condiments 
prepared by such manufacturers as Durkee & Co., Annear 
& Co., Cross & Blackwell, and several others, for this 
especial purpose. With such helps and a sufficient quan- 
tity of stock on hand, a choice, rich soup of any variety 
may be gotten up in thirty minutes. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a shin of beef, or a piece off the shoulder, 
slowly and thoroughly, the day before desiring to use it ; 
skim well the next day and thin the jelly, if necessary, with 
water ; add a little brandy, a grated carrot, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter rubbed smooth in brown flour, a little vermi- 
celli, and spices to taste. Two or three eggs may be boiled 
hard, mashed smooth, and placed in the tureen before 
turning in the soup. 

Beef Soup, No. 2. — Boil a shin of beef of moderate size, 
crack the bone, remove the tough outside skin, wash, and 
place in a kettle to boil with six or eight quarts of water. 
Let it boil about four hours, until it becomes perfectly 
tender, then take it out of the liquid. Add salt, one pint of 
tomatoes, two onions cut in small pieces, two turnips cut in 
quarters, one grated carrot, one large tablespoonful of sugar, 
a little sweet marjoram and thyme rubbed fine, one red 
pepper cut in very small pieces, also a celery top or a small 
quantity of bruised celery seed. This soup may be thick- 
ened according to taste either with vermicelli, macaroni, 
noodles, or drop dumplings. 

For an incidental side dish, take the soup meat that has 
been cut from the bones, chop fine while warm, season with 
salt and pepper, add one teacup of soup saved out before

putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and slice down 
for tea or lunch when cold. 

Beef Soup with Okra. — Cut a round steak in small pieces 
and fry in three tablespoonfuls of butter, together with one 
sliced onion, until very brown ; put into a soup kettle with 
four quarts of cold water, and boil slowly an hour ; add 
salt, pepper, and one pint of sliced okra, and simmer three 
and one-half hours longer. Strain before serving. 

Corned Beef Soup. — When the liquor in which corned beef 
and vegetables have been boiled is cold, remove all the 
grease that has risen and hardened on the top, and add 
tomatoes and tomato catsup and boil half an hour — thus 
making an excellent tomato soup ; or add to it rice, or sago, 
or pearl barley, or turn it into a vegetable soup by boiling in 
the liquor any vegetables that are fancied. Several varieties 
of soups may have this stock for a basis and be agreeable 
to the taste. 

Ox-tail Soup. — Chop the ox-tail into small pieces ; set on 
the fire with a tablespoonful of butter, and stir until brown, 
and then pour off the fat; add broth to taste, and boil gently 
until the pieces of tail are well cooked. Season with pepper, 
salt, and three or four tomatoes ; boil fifteen minutes and 
then serve. This soup can be made with water, instead of 
the stock broth, in which case season with carrot, onion, 
turnip, and parsley. 

Mutton BrotL — After the steaks have been cut from the 
leg, the lower part is just adapted for a soup. The neck- 
piece is also very nice. Boil the meat very gently in cold 
water, adding a turnip, a carrot, and a spoonful of rice. All 
the fat should be removed. Toward the last, add a little 
minced parsley. Dumplings are an excellent addition. 

V^etable Soup. — Take two pounds of shin of beef and two 
pounds of knuckle of veal ; remove all the fat and break 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 39 

the bones and take out the marrow ; put into a pot with five 
pints of water ; add a teaspoonfiil of salt, and then cover and 
let it come to a boil quickly ; remove the scum that rises, 
and set where it will simmer for five hours ; one hour before 
serving, add two young carrots, scraped and cut in slices, 
half a head of celery, and a small onion cut into squares ; in 
half an hour add one turnip sliced, and in fifteen minutes 
one cauliflower broken in small pieces. 

Bean Soup. — Soak one and a half pints of beans in cold 
water over night. In the morning drain off the water, wash 
the beans in fresh water, and put into soup-ketde.with four 
quarts of good beef stock, from which all the fat has been 
removed. Set it where it will boil slowly but steadily for 
three hours at the least. Two hours before it is needed for 
use, slice in an onion . and a carrot. Some think it im- 
proved by adding a little tomato. If the beans are not liked 
whole, strain through a colander and send to the table hot. 

Black Bean Soup. — Three pounds soup bone, one quart 
black beans, soaked over night and drained ; one onion, 
chopped fine ; juice of one lemon. Pepper^ salt, and Durkee's 
Challenge Sauce to taste. Boil the soup bone, beans, and 
onions together six hours ; strain, and add seasoning. Slice 
lemon and put on top when served. 

Tomato Soup. — Take a knuckle of veal, a bony piece of 
beef, a neck of mutton, or almost any piece of meat you 
may happen to have ; set it over the fire in a small quantity 
of water, cover it closely, and boil very gently, to extract 
the juices of the meat. When nearly done, add a quantity 
of peeled tomatoes, and stew till the tomatoes are done ; add 
salt and pepper to your taste. This is a very cheap, healthful, 
and easily made soup. 

Tomato Soup, No. ,2. — Take one quart of tomatoes. When 
boiling, add one taaspoonful of soda, two pulverized soda 



40 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

crackers, one pint of hot water, one pint of milk, salt, and 
pepper ; strain through a colander and serve hot. 

Green Pea Soup. — Boil the empty pods of a half-peck of 
green peas in one gallon of water one hour ; strain them 
out ; add four pounds of beef cut into small pieces, and boil 
slowly for an hour and a half longer. Half an hour before 
serving add the shelled peas, and twenty minutes later half 
a cup of rice flour, salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
After adding the rice flour stir frequently so as to pre- 
vent scorching. 

Dried Split Pea Soup. — One gallon of water, one quart of 
soaked split peas, half a pound of salt pork, one pound of 
beef. Put over the fire, seasoning with salt and pepper, 
celery salt, salpicant, curry powder, marjoram, or savory; 
let it boil slowly for two hours, or until the quantity of 
liquor does not exceed two quarts. Pour into a colander 
and press the peas through with a spoon. Fry two or three 
slices of stale bread in butter till brown, scatter them in the 
soup after it is placed in the tureen. 

Com Soup. — Cut the corn from the cob, and to a pint of 
corn allow one quart of hot water ; boil an hour and press 
.through a colander; put into a saucepan an ounce of but- 
ter and a tablespoonful of flour, being careful to stir well to 
prevent it being lumpy; then add the corn pulp, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, a pint of boiling milk, and half a pint 
of cream. 

Onion Soup. — Slice ten medium-sized onions and fry brown 
in butter with a tablespoonful and a half of flour ; put into a 
saucepan, and stir in slowly four or five pints of milk and 
water (about one-third water) ; season to taste, and add a 
teacupful of grated potato ; set in a kettle of boiling water, 
and cook ten minutes ; add a cup of sweet cream and serve 
quickly. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 41 

Mock-turtle Soup. — Scald a calf's head and wash it clean ; 
boil it in a large pot of water for half an hour, cut all the 
skin off, and take the tongue out. Take the broth made of 
a knuckle of veal, put in the tongue and skin, with one 
onion, half-ounce of cloves, half-ounce of mace, half a nut- 
meg, all kinds of sweet herbs chopped fine, and three 
anchovies. Stew till tender ; then take out the meat, and 
cut it in pieces two inches square ; cut the tongue, previously 
skinned, in slices ; strain the liquor through a sieve ; melt 
lialf a pound of butter in a stewpan ; put in it half a pound 
of flour and stir it till smooth — if at all lumpy, strain it; add 
the liquor, stirring it all the time ; then put to the meat the 
juice of two lemons, or one bottle of Madeira wine, if pre- 
ferred ; season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne 
pepper ; put in a few meat balls and eight eggs boiled hard. 
Stew gently one hour, and serve in a tureen ; if too thick, 
add more liquor before stewing the last time. 

Mock-turtle Soup. No. 2. — Take a calf's head and about 
two pounds of delicate fat pork. Put both into a soup- 
kettle, with two onions, sweet herbs, celery, pepper, and 
mace. Fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till 
the meat is tender. Take out the head and the pork, return 
the bones of the head into the soup ; let it stew several 
hours longer ; and, when cold, take off the fat, strain the 
soup, and thicken ; add the juice of a lemon and half a pint 
of white wine. Cut up the head and pork into pieces ; warm 
them up in the soup, adding some choice meat balls made 
from finely minced, savory meat. The pork will be found 
quite an addition to the soup and a substitute for the fat of 
the turtle. 

Gumbo Soup. — Cut up two chickens, two slices of ham, and 
two onions into dice ; flour them, and fry the whole to a 
light brown ; then fill the frying-pan with boiling water, stir 



42 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

it a few minutes, and turn the whole into a saucepan con- 
taining three quarts of boiling water ; let it boil forty min- 
utes, removing the scum. In the meantime soak three pods 
of okra in cold water twenty minutes ; cut them into thin 
slices, and add to the other ingredients ; let it boil one hour 
and a half Add a quart of canned tomatoes and a cupful 
of boiled rice half an hour before serving. 

Southern Gumbo Soup. — Cut up one chicken, and fry it to 
a light brown, also two slices of bacon ; pour on them three 
quarts of boiling water; add one onion and some sweet 
herbs tied in a bag ; simmer them gently three hours and a 
half; strain off the liquor, take off the fat, and then put the 
ham and chicken (cut into small pieces) into the liquor; 
add half a teacup of sliced okra, also half a teacup of boiled 
rice. Boil all half an hour, and just before serving add a 
glass of wine and a dozen oysters with their juice. 

Julienne Soup. — Scrape two carrots and two turnips, and 
cut in pieces an inch long ; cut slices lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick; then cut again, so as to make 
square strips ; put them in a saucepan, with two ounces of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of cabbage chopped fine, and 
half an onion chopped ; set on the fire and stir until half 
fried ; add broth as you wish to make thick or thin ; boil 
until done ; salt to taste ; skim off the fat, and serve ; it 
takes about two hours to prepare this soup properly. It 
can be served with rice or barley. 

Macaroni or Vermicelli Soup. — Two small carrots, four 
onions, two turnips, two cloves, one tablespoonful salt, pep- 
per to taste. Herbs — marjoram, parsley, and thyme. Put 
any cooked or uncooked meat and its bones in enough water 
to cover them ; when they boil, skim them and add the 
vegetables. Simmer three or four hours, then strain 
through a colander and put back in the saucepan to reheat. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 43 

Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place 
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it — the last 
thing. Vermicelli will need to be soaked a short time only — 
not to be boiled. 

White Soup.— Boil a knuckle of veal for three hours. Add 
a quarter of a pound of macaroni, and when done, a pint of 
cream. Season with lemon-peel and mace. 

Turkey Soup. — Take the turkey bones and boil three- 
quarters of an hour in water enough to cover them ; add a 
little summer savory and celery chopped fine. Just before 
serving, thicken with a little browned flour, and season 
with pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter. 

Chicken Soup. — To the broth in which chickens have been 
boiled for salad, etc., add one onion and eight or ten 
tomatoes ; season with pepper and salt ; add Challenge Sauce 
or Salpicant, if desired ; boil thirty minutes ; add two well- 
beaten eggs just before sending to the table. 

Lobster Soup. — To boll a lobster, put it in a fish-kettle and 
cover it with cold water, cooking it on a quick fire. Remove 
the small bladder found near the head, and take out a small 
vein found immediately under the shell all along the back 
of the lobster, and use the rest. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and salad also. All the under 
shell and small claws are pounded in a mortar to make the 
soup ; when pounded, put it into a pan and set it on the fire 
with broth or water. The meat is cut in small pieces, to 
be added afterward. The soup is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour ; then put it in a sieve and press it 
with a masher to extract the juice. To make it thicker, a 
small piece of parsnip can be added and mashed with the 
rest into a pan, so that all the essence is extracted in that way 
from the lobster. When you have strained it put a little

butter with it and add as much broth as is required ; pul 
some of the meat in the tureen and pour the soup over it. 

Clam Soup. — Wash the clams free from grit; boil them in 
a pint of water till they will come from the shells easily. 
Take a small quantity of the liquor, add some milk,-thicken 
it with a little flour, and add the clams. Split crackers are 
very nice added. 

Portable Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal, also the feet, a 
shin of beef, a cowheel or any other bones of meat which 
will produce a stiff jelly, in a large kettle, with as much 
water as will cover them. Let it stand a long time over the 
fire before it boils. Skim it most thoroughly, until the 
broth appears entirely clear. Then fill up the kettle with 
hot water, and boil it eight hours, or until it has evaporated 
so as to be somewhat thick. Run it through a hair sieve, 
set it in a cool place where it will harden very quickly. Skim 
off" every particle of fat, and return it to a saucepan ; skim 
and stir continually, so that it may not scorch, and all the 
previous labor be lost, until it becomes a very thick syrup. 
As soon as it can be no longer done in this way, transfer it 
to a deep jar, and set into a kettle of water, hot, but not 
boiling, until it jellies very thick. This will keep good 
many months, if packed dry in tin canisters. This is the con- 
centrated essence of soup, and is a most convenient article 
of use, either at home in an emergency or in traveling, and 
especially at sea. To make a pint of soup, cut off" a piece 
as large as a walnut, dissolve it in the boiling water, and it 
is ready for use. 

Fluid Beef. — Among the advanced preparations of the day 
meat extracts are taking a high place. One of the finest of 
these preparations is " Johnston's Fluid Beef" It contains 
all the nutritive constituents of the beef, and is readily 
available for soups, sandwiches, beef tea, etc. For medi- 
cal uses, traveling, picnics, etc,, it is very convenient. To 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 4g 

use for soups and beef tea, add a teaspoonful to a cup of 
boiling water and season to taste ; or as a sandwich paste, 
it may be used on toast, with or without butter. Put up 
in cans of various sizes, from two ounces to one pound, 
which can be left open without injury to contents. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO SOUPS. 

Meat Balls for Soup. — Take fresh cooked meat or fowl and 
chop fine ; season with pepper, salt, and herbs, and a little 
lemon ; mix together with an egg ; roll in bread-crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Browned Flour for Soups. — Dredge the bottom of a spider 
well with flour, and shake it over hot coals, letting it brown 
gradually, but not burn. Keep it in a dry place, in a tin 
canister, without wholly closing the lid. It is very con- 
venient to have it already prepared, although when used fresh 
it is much nicer. 

Home-made Noodles — a substitute for Vermicelli — Wet with 
the yelks of four eggs as much fine, dry, sifted flour as will 
make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Roll it out 
as thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch 
and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and 
place four of them one upon the other. Cut them in the 
finest possible strips, separate them with the point of a 
knife, and spread them on the pie-board so that they may 
dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into 
the boiling soup, and in five minutes they will be done. 

Drop Dumplings. — Take prepared flour, add a little beef 
drippings or lard, well rubbed through, and moisten to a soft 
dough. With floured hands pinch off very small pieces and 
form into balls by rolling in the palm of the hand. In boil- 
ing dumplings of any kind, put them in the water one at a 
time. If they are put in together they will blend with each 
other. 



III.— FISH, OYSTERS, Etc. 

HINTS CONCERNING FISH — TESTS OF FRESHNESS, HOW TO CLEAN, 
HOW TO DRESS, HOW TO BOIL FISH, HOW TO BAKE FISH, 
HOW TO BROIL FISH, HOW TO FRY FISH, ETC. FIFTY-THREE 
RECIPES FOR COOKING FISH, OYSTERS, ETC., AND FOR INCI- 
DENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

FISH should be eaten as soon as possible after being 
taken from the water. In every kind of fish, the 
brightness of the eyes, redness of the gills, firmness 
of the flesh, and stiffness of the fins are indications of fresh- 
ness. Fish should be thoroughly cleaned as soon as prac- 
ticable. Great care should be taken to remove every atom 
of blood, to rinse carefully, and not to soak them longer 
than necessary. Fish are dressed in a variety of ways to 
suit different tastes — ^boiled, baked, broiled, and fried. The 
most ordinary methods are broiling or frying. In boiling, 
large fish should be wrapped in a cloth previously floured 
to prevent sticking, tied with a string, and covered with 
from two to three inches of cold water already salted ; from 
six to ten minutes per pound will generally be found suf- 
ficient for boiling. Remove from the fire the moment it is 
done, and place upon a sieve to drain. 

In baking fish, cleanse and wipe dry ; fill to taste ; sew to- 
gether ; place in a dripping-pan ; season with salt and pepper ; 
add suflScient water to baste with, or if a filling of oysters 
is used, baste with the liquor off them. The space between 
the fish and the sides of the pan may be filled with slices of 
raw potatoes one-quarter of an inch thick, and serve fish 
and potatoes together, A large fish will bake in an hour, 

46 



Fisn, OYSTERS, ETC. 47 

For broiling, thoroughly cleanse and dry ; split open so 
that the backbone will be flat in the middle; 'season with salt 
and pepper, and place on a buttered gridiron over a clear 
fire with the inside downward until it begins to brown, then 
turn over. When done, serve on a hot dish and butter lib- 
erally. 

Fish may be very nicely fi-ied in hot lard with only a 
seasoning of salt and pepper, and a little flour dredged 
over it, or it may be spread with beaten eggs and rolled in 
cracker or bread crumbs before frying. Challenge sauce, 
Worcestershire sauce, and similar condiments upon fish will 
be found to give a most delicate and piquant flavoring. 



RECIPES. 

Broiled Shad, — Scrape, split, wash, and dry the shad on a 
cloth; season with pepper and salt; grease the gridiron 
well ; as soon as it is hot lay the shad on to broil with the 
inside downward. One side being well browned, turn it. 
It should broil a quarter of an hour or more, according to 
thickness. Butter well and send to table hot. 

Baked Sliad. — Many people are of the opinion that the 
very best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it 
with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, and parsley, and 
mix this up with beaten yelk of egg ; fill the fish with it, 
and sew it up or fasten a string around it. Pour over it a 
little water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. 
A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter 
to bake. 

Halibut Cutlets. — Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, 
wipe them with a dry cloth, and season with saJ t and cay- 
enne pepper. Have ready a pan of yelk of eggs well 
beaten and a dish of grated bread-crumbs. Pu( somo fresh 



48 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

iard or beef drippings in a frying-pan and hold it over the 
fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets in the egg, and then in 
the bread-crumbs. Fry a light brown; serve up hot. 
Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner. 

Baked Cod or Halibut. — Use a piece of fish from the middle 
of the back, weighing four, five, or six pounds. Lay the fish 
in very cold salt-and-water for two hours ; wipe dry ; make 
deep gashes in both sides at right angles with the back- 
bone, and rub into these, as well as coat it all over with, a 
force-meat made of the crumbs, pork, herbs, onion, and 
seasoning, made to adhere by raw &%%. Lay in the baking- 
pan and pour over it the drawn butter (which should be quite 
thin), season with the anchovy sauce, lemon juice, pepper, 
and a pinch of parsley. Bake in a moderate oven nearly an 
hour — or even more if the piece be large — basting frequently 
lest it should brown too fast. Add a little butter-and-water 
when the sauce thickens too much. When the fish is done, 
remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy over it. A few 
capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant addition to 
the gravy. 

Boiled Halibut. — Take a small halibut, or what you require 
from a large fish. Put it into the fish-kettle, with the back 
of the fish undermost ; cover it with cold water, in which a 
handful of salt and a bit of saltpetre the size of a hazel-nut 
have been dissolved. When it begins to boil skim it care- 
fully, and then let it just simmer till it is done. Four pounds 
of fish will require half an hour nearly to boil it. Drain it, 
garnish with horse-radish or parsley. Egg sauce, or plain 
meRed butter, are served with it. 

Boiled Roekflsh. — After the fish has been nicely cleaned, 
put it into a pot with water enough to cover it, and throw 
in salt in the proportion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of 
fish. Boil it slowly until the meat is tender and easily sep- 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 49 

arates from the bones. A large fish will require an hour to 
cook. When done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few- 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, laid around it and over 
it. Eat with egg-sauce. 

WMte FisL— This fish may be broiled, fried, or baked. 
To bake it, prepare a stuffing of fine bread-crumbs, a little 
salt pork chopped very fine ; season with sage, parsley, pep- 
per, and salt. Fill the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, 
sprinkle the outside with salt, pepper, and flour, and bake. 
In frying white fish, pour off the fat as it accumulates, as it 
is apt to be too fat when served. 

Broiled Salmon.— The steaks from the centre of the fish 
are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little 
butter, and broil over a clear but slow fire. 

Smoked Salmon, Broiled. — Take a half pound of smoked 
salmon and parboil it ten minutes ; lay in cold water for the 
same length of time ; wipe dry and broil over a clear fire. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter while hot ; season with 
cayenne and the juice of half a lemon; pile in a "log- 
cabin " square upon a hot plate, and serve with dry toast. 

BoHed Salmon. — A piece weighing six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boiled slowly 
for three-quarters of an hour. It should be eaten with egg or 
caper sauce. If any remain after dinner, it may be placed 
in a deep dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacupful of 
boiling vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, and it will 
make a nice breakfast dish. 

Baked Salmon with Cream Sauce. — Butter a sheet of fools- 
cap paper on both sides, and wrap the fish up in it, pinning 
the ends securely together. Lay in the baking-pan, and 
pour six or seven spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. 
Turn another pan over all, and steam in a moderate oven 
4

from three-quarters of an nour to an hour, lifting the cover, 
from time to time, to baste and assure yourself that the 
paper is not burning. Meanwhile, have ready in a sauce- 
pan a cup of cream, in which you would do well to dis- 
solve a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise 
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this in a 
vessel placed within another of hot water ; thicken with a 
heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch ; add a tablespoonful of 
butter, pepper and salt to taste, a liberal pinch of minced 
parsley, and when the fish is unwrapped and dished, pour 
half the dressing slowly over it, sending the rest to table 
in a boat. If you have no cream, use milk, and add a beaten 
egg to the thickening. 

Salmoii Steaks or Cutlets Pried. — Cu': slices from the middle 
of the fish one inch thick ; wipe dry, and salt slightly ; dip 
in egg, then in cracker crumbs ; fry very quickly in hot 
butter ; drain off every drop of grease, and serve upon a hot 
dish. Sprinkle green parsley in bunches over it. The 
French use the best salad-oil in this recipe instead of butter. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty-four hours, 
changing the water frequently ; afterward pour boiling water 
around it, and let it stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and 
then pour on boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

Pried Perch. — Scale and clean them perfectly ; dry them 
well, flour and fry them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of 
fried parsley round them. 

Pried Trout. — Wash, drain, and split ; roll in flour, season 
with salt ; have some thin slices of salt pork in a pan, and 
when very hot put in the fish and fry to a nice brown. 

Stewed Trout. — Clean and wash the fish with care, and 
wipe it perfectly dry ; put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls 
ot butter, dredge in as it melts a little flour, grate half a 



FISH, OYSTEHS, ETC. 51 

nutmeg, a few blades of mace, a little cayenne, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix it all together ; then lay in the fish, let 
it brown slightly; pour over some veal gravy, a lemon 
thinly sliced ; stew very slowly for forty minutes ; take out 
the fish, and add two glasses of wine to the gravy. Lay 
the fish on a hot dish, and pour over it some of the gravy. 
Serve the rest in a sauce-tureen. 

Fried CatfisL — Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — if pos- 
sible, directly out of the water. The larger ones are gener- 
ally coarse and strong ; the small-sized fish are the best. 
Wash and clean them, cut off their heads and tails, remove 
the upper part of the backbone near the shoulders, and 
score them along the back with deep gashes or incisions. 
Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty of lard, 
boiling fast when the catfish are put into the pan. Or you 
may fry them in the drippings or gravy saved from roast 
beef or veal. They are very nice dipped in a batter of 
beaten egg and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be done 
plain, though not in so nice a way, with Indian' meal instead 
of bread-crumbs. Drain off the lard before you dish them. 
Touch each incision or cut very slightly with a little cay- 
enne before they go to table. 

Pried Eels. — ^After skinning, emptying, and washing them 
as clean as possible, cut them into short pieces, and dry 
them well with a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt 
and cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them in boiling 
lard ; when nicely browned, drain and dry them, and send 
to the table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or with 
fish-sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and then 
fried, or into egg and dried bread-crumbs, and served with 
plenty of crisped parsley 

Plsli Chowder. — Take a fresh haddock, of three or four 
pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of three inches 



52 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

square. Place in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six 
slices of salt pork, fry brown, theii add three onions sliced 
thin, and fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, 
and place on the onions and pork a layer of fish. Sprinkle 
over a little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced 
potatoes, a layer of fish and potatoes, till the fish is used up. 
Cover with water, and let it boil for half an hour. Pound 
six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and pour into the pot ; 
and, lastly, add a pint of milk ; let it scald well, and serve. 

New England Chowdef. — Take a good haddock, cod, or any 
other solid fish, cut it in pieces three inches square ; put a 
pound of fat, salt pork, cut into strips, into the pot ; set it 
on hot coals and fry out the grease ; take out the pork, but 
leave the grease in the bottom of the pot, and put in a layer 
of fish, over that a layer of sliced onions, over that a layer 
of fish, with slips of the fried pork, then another layer of 
onions and a few sliced raw potatoes, and so on alternately 
until your fish is all in ; mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot ; season to suit your taste, and boil for 
half an hour ; -have ready some pilot bread, soaked in water, 
and throw them into your chowder five minutes before tak- 
ing off; serve in a tureen. 

Fish-balls. — Two cupfuls cold boiled 'codfish, fresh or 
salted. Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and 
skin ; work in one cupful of mashed potatoes, and moisten 
with a half cup of drawn butter with an egg beaten in. Sea- 
son to taste. Have them soft enough to mold, yet firm 
enough to keep in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry- 
quickly to a golden-brown in lard or clean dripping. Take 
from the fat so soon as they are done ; lay in a colander or 
sieve and shake gently, to free them from every drop of 
grease. Turn out for moment on white paper to absorb any 
lingering drops, and serve on a hot dish. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 53 

Stewed Oysters. — Take one quart of oysters ; put tlie liquor 
(a teacupful for three persons) in a stewpan, and add half as 
much more water, salt and pepper to taste, and let it boil. 
Have your oysters ready in a bowl, and the moment the 
liquor boils, pour in all your oysters, say ten for each per- 
son, or six will do. Now, watch carefully, and as soon as 
it begins to boil take out your watch, count just thirty 
seconds, and take your oysters from the stove. You will 
have your big dish ready, with one and a half tablespoonfuls 
of cream or milk for each person. Pour your stew on this 
and serve imrriediately. Never boil an oyster in milk. 

Maayland Stewed Oysters. — Put the juice into a saucepan 
and let it simmer, skimming it carefully ; then rub the yelks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and one large spoonful of flour 
well together, and stir into the juice. Cut in small pieces 
quarter of a pound of "butter, half a teaspoonful of whole 
allspice, a little salt, a little cayenne, and the juice of a fresh 
lemon; let all simmer ten minutes, and just before dishing 
add the oysters. This is for two quarts of oysters. 

Panned Oysters. — Have ready several small pans of block 
tin, with upright sides. Cut stale bread in thin slices, then 
round them to a size that will just fit in the bottoms of your 
pans. Toast these quickly to a light brown, butter, and lay 
within your tins. Wet with a great spoonful of oyster liquid, 
then, with a silver fork, arrange upon the toast as many oys- 
ters as the pans will hold without heaping them up. Dust 
with pepper and salt, put a bit of butter on top, and set the 
pans, when all are full, upon the floor of a quick oven. Cover 
with an inverted baking-pan to keep in steam and flavor, 
and cook until the oysters " ruffle." Eight minutes in a 
brisk oven should be enough. Send very hot to the table 
in tins in which they were roasted. Next to roasting in the 
shell, this mode of cooking oysters best preserves theii 
native flavor. 



54 Tim HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Roasted Oysters. — Take oysters in the shell; wash the 
shells clean, and lay them on hot coals ; when they are done 
they will begin to open. Remove the upper shell, and serve 
the oysters in the lower shell, with a little melted butter 
poured over each, and season to taste. 

Oyster Toast. — Select fifteen plump oysters; mince them, 
and season with mixed pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; beat 
the yelks of four eggs and mix them with half a pint of 
cream. Put the whole into a saucepan and set it over the 
fire to simmer till thick ; stir it well, and do not let it boil, 
lest it should curdle. Toast five pieces of bread, and butter 
them ; when your dish is near the boiling-point, remove it 
from the fire and pour it over the toast. 

Cream Oysters.-^Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream ; 
butter, pepper, and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and 
oysters in separate kettles to heat, the oysters in their own 
liquor, and let them come to a boil; when sufficiently 
cooked, skim ; then take them out of the liquid and put 
them into a dish to keep warm. Put the cream and 
liquid together. Season to taste, and thicken with powdered 
cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir in the oysters. 

Broiled Oysters. — Drain select oysters in a colander. Dip 
them one by one into melted butter, to prevent sticking to 
the gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron. Broil over 
a clear fire. When nicely browned on both sides, season 
with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay them on hot 
buttered toast, moistened with a little hot water. Serve 
very hot. Oysters cooked in this way and served on broiled 
beefsteak are delicious. 

Eried Oysters. — Select the largest and finest fresh oysters, 
put them into a colander and pour over a little water to 
rinse them ; then place them on a clean towel and dry them. 
Have ready some grated bread-crumbs, seasoned with 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 55 

pepper and salt, and plenty of yelk of egg beaten till very 
light ; and to each egg allow a large teaspoonful of rich 
cream or of the best fresh butter. Beat the egg and cream 
together. Dip each oyster first into the egg and cream, 
and then into the crumbs. Repeat this twice, until the 
oysters are well coated all over. Have ready boiling, in a 
frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh butter and lard. It 
must very nearly fill the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in, otherwise they will be heavy and greasy. 
Fry them of a yellow brown on both sides, and serve hot. 

Oyster Salad, see Salads. 

Spiced or Pickled Oysters. — Put into a porcelain kettle one 
hundred and fifty large oysters with the liquor ; add salt, 
and simmer till the edges roll or curl ; skim them out ; add 
to the liquor one pint of white wine vinegar, one dozen 
blades mace, three dozen cloves, and three dozen pepper- 
corns ; let it come to a boil, and pour over the oysters. 
Serve with slices of lemon floating in saucer. 

Oyster Omelette. — Allow for every six large oysters or 
twelve small ones one egg ; remove the hard part and mince 
the rest very fine ; take the yelks of eight eggs and whites of 
four, beat till very light, then mix in the oysters ; season and 
beat up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of butter, let it 
melt ; when the butter boils, skim it and turn in the ome- 
lette ; stir until it stiffens ; fry light brown ; when the under 
side is brown, turn on to a hot platter. To brown the upper 
side, hold a red-hot shovel over it. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 1. — Open the shells, setting aside for 
use the deepest ones. Have ready some melted butter, not 
hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each 
oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay in 
the shells,which should be arranged in a baking-pan. Add 



56 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

tc each a little lemon juice, sift bread-crumbs over it, and 
bake in a quick oven until done. Serve in the shells. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 2. — Cover the bottom of a baking- 
dish (well buttered) with a layer of crumbs, and wet these 
with cream, put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, 
and strew with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the oys- 
ters, with a little of their liquor. Pepper them, stick bits of 
butter in among them, and cover with dry crumbs until the 
oysters are entirely hidden. Add more pieces of butter, very 
small, and arrange thickly on top. Set in the oven, invert 
a plate over it to keep in the flavor, and bake until the juice 
bubbles up to the top. Remove the cover, and brown on 
the upper grating for two or three minutes. Serve in the 
bake-dish. 

Oyster Pie. — Line a dish with a puff paste or a rich bis- 
cuit paste, and dredge well with flour ; drain one quart of 
oysters ; season with pepper, salt, and butter, and pour into 
the dish ; add some of the liquor ; dredge with flour, and 
cover with a top crust, leaving a small opening in the 
centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Oyster Patties. — Put one quart of oysters in a saucepan, 
with liquor enough to coVer them, set it on the stove and 
let them come to a boil ; skim well, and stir in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a little pepper, and salt. Line some 
patty-pans with puff-paste, fill with oysters, cover with paste, 
and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. The upper crust 
may be omitted, if desired. 

Oyster Macaroni. — Boil macaroni in a cloth to keep it 
straight. Put a layer in a dish seasoned with pepper, salt, 
and butter, then a layer of oysters, until the dish is full. 
Mix some grated bread with a beaten egg, spread over the 
top, and bake. 

Oyster Sauce, see Sauces. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 57 

Boiled Lobster. — If purchased alive, lobsters should be 
chosen by weight (the heaviest are the best) and their live- 
liness and briskness of motion. When freshly boiled they 
are stiff, and their tails turn strongly inward ; when the fish 
appear soft and watery, they are stale. The flesh of the 
male lobster is generally considered of the finest flavor for 
eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, 
on account of the coral. 

To properly boil lobsters, throw them living into a kettle 
of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be destroyed in 
an instant. Let them boil for about half an hour. When 
done, take them out of the kettle, wipe them clean, and rub 
the shell with a little salad-oil, which will give a clear red 
appearance. Crack the large claws without mashing them, 
and with a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to 
end. The head, which is never eaten, should also be sepa- 
rated from the body, but laid so near it that the division is 
almost imperceptible. Dress in any way preferred. 

Deviled Lobster. — Procure a live, hea\'y lobster ; put it in 
a pot of boiling water, with a handful of salt to it. When 
done and cold, take out all the meat carefully, putting the 
fat and coral on separate plates ; cut the meat in small 
pieces, rub the coral to a paste ; stir the fat in it, with a little 
salt, cayenne, chopped parsley, essence of anchovies, and 
salad-oil, or melted butter and lemon juice ; cut the back of 
the lobster-shell in two, lengthwise ; wash clean ; stir the 
lobster and sauce well together; fill the shells; sprinkle 
bread-crumbs and a few bits of butter over the top ; set in 
the oven until the crumbs are brown. 

Stewed Lobster. — A middling-sized lobster is best ; pick . 
all the meat from the shells and mince it fine ; season with 
u little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; add three or four 
spoonfuls of rich gravy and a small bit of butter. If you 



58 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAR Y. 

have no , gravy, use more butter and two spoonfuls oi 
vinegar ; stew about twenty minutes. 

Lobster Salad, see Salads. 
Lobster Croquettes, see Croquettes. 
Lobster Sauce, see Sauces. 

Lobster Patties, — Proceed as in oyster patties, but use the 
meat of a cold boiled lobster. 

Terrapins. — Put the terrapins into a pot of boiling water, 
where they must remain until they are quite dead. You 
then divest them of their outer skin and toe-nails ; and, 
after washing them in warm water, boil them again until 
they become quite tender, adding a handful of salt to the 
water. Having satisfied yourself of their being perfectly 
tender, take off the shells and clean the terrapins very care- 
fully, removing the sandbag and gall without by any rneans 
breaking them. Then cut the meat into small pieces and put 
into a saucepan, adding the juice which has been given out 
in Gutting them up, but no water, and season with salt, cay- 
enne, and black pepper to your taste, adding a quarter of 
a pound of good butter for each terrapin and a handful of 
flour for thickening. After stirring a short time, add four 
or five tablespoonfuls of cream, and a half pint of good 
Maderia to every four terrapins, and serve hot in a deep 
dish. A very little mace may be added and a large table- 
spoonful of mustard ; just before serving, add the yelks of 
four hard-boiled eggs. During the stewing, particular 
attention must be paid to stirring the preparation frequently ; 
and terrapins cannot possibly be served too hot. 

Mock Terrapin. — Take half a calf's l-Ver, season and fry it 
brown ; chop it into dice, not too small ; flour it thickly, 
and add a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a little cayenne 
pepper, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a lump of but- 



FISIT, OYSTERS, ETC. 59 

ter the size of an egg, and a teacupful of water. Let it boil 
a minute or two. Cold veal will do as well as liver. 

Scalloped Crabs.— Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Take them from the water when 
done and pick out all the meat ; be careful not to break the 
shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and pepper ; taste, 
and if not enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. 
Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoonful of 
cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two 
Jablespoonfuls of butter (even full) ; stir all well together ; 
wash the shells clean,, and fill each shell full of the mixture; 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with butter, then 
bake until nicely browned on top. 

Soft-shell Crabs. — Season with pepper and salt; roll in 
flour, then in egg, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Serve hot with rich condiments. 

Stewed Clams. — Chop the clams and season with pepper 
and salt; put in a saucepan butter the size of an &^'g, and 
when melted add a teaspoonful of flour; add slowly the 
clam liquor and then the clams, and cook three minutes; 
then add half a pint of cream, and serve. 

Deviled Clams. — Chop fifty clams very fine ; take two 
tomatoes, one onion chopped equally fine, a little parsley, 
thyme, and sweet marjoram, a little salt, pepper, and bread- 
crumbs, adding the juice of the clams until the mixture is 
of the consistency of sausage ; put it in the shells with a 
lump of butter on each ; cover with bread-crumbs, and bake 
one-half hour. 

Clam Chowder. — Forty-five clams chopped, one quart of 
sliced potatoes, one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices 
salt pork, fry to a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat 



60 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

from the pork, a layer of potatoes, clams, onions, a little pep- 
per and salt ; another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc., 
until all are in. Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook 
three hours, being careful not to burn. Add a teacupful of 
milk just before serving. 

ScaJIops. — Wipe dry; dip separately into seasoned egg, 
then into cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO FISH. 

Bread Staffing for Fish. — Take about half a pound of stale 
bread and soak in water, and when soft press out the water; 
add a very little chopped suet, pepper, salt, a large table- 
spoonful of onion minced and fried, and, if preferred, a little 
minced parsley ; cook a trifle, and after removing from the 
fire add a beaten egg. 

Bread Stuffing, No. 2. — Bread-crumbs with a little chopped 
parsley and pork, salt, pepper, and butter. Fill up the fish, 
sew it closely, then bake. 

Cleaniiig a Shad. — Scale and scrape it carefully; split it 
down the back and remove the contents, reserving the roc 
or melt. Wash well and cook as desired. 

Soaking Salt PisL — Very salt fish should be soaked several 
hours in three or four changes of warm water. Place the 
skin side up, so that salt crystals may fall away from the 
under or meat side. Wipe carefully and clean, then soak 
for an hour in very cold water. 

Fish in Season. — As a rule, fish are in best condition just 
before they spawn, and many are so while they are full of 
roe, as smelts, mackerel, and shad. As soon as spawning is 
over, they become unfit for food, some of them becoming 
positively unwholesome. In season, the flesh is firm and it 
boils white ; when it boils to a bluish hue, the fish are not 
in season, or are stale, 



IV.— POULTRY AND GAME. 

GENERAL REMARKS ON POULTRY AND GAME — HOW TO SELECT, 
PREPARATION FOR BOILING, FOR ROASTING, ETC. THIRTY-ONE 
RECIPES FOR POULTRY AND GAME. 

POULTRY shoufd invariably be selected young, plump, 
and well fed, but not too fat. If old and tough, fowls 
are never as savory when cooked as if they be young 
and tender. This applies especially to ducks and geese. The 
flesh of young fowls will be firm and fleshy to the touch, 
and heavy in proportion to their size ; the skin should be 
clear, white, and finely grained, the toes pliable and easily 
broken when bent back, the end of the breast-bone also 
pliable. All kinds of poultry, turkeys especially, are im- 
proved by hanging a day or two, unless the weather should 
be exceedingly sultry. Dark-legged fowls are best for 
roasting, while the white-legged ones should be chosen for 
boiling. 

In preparing fowls for boiling, some persons soak fowls 
an hour or two in skimmed-milk and then sew them in a 
floured cloth. This tends to preserve them of a nice color, 
but it may be dispensed with by carefully skimming them 
while over the fire. 

In dressing poultry, care should be taken not to break the 
gall ; a thorough cleansing in every part also is necessary. 
The hairs should be singed off with a well-lighted piece of 
paper, holding the fowl before a hot fire. All the pin- 
feathers should be carefully and entirely removed, as also 
the oil-bag at the end of the back. The legs should be cut 
off at the first joint next to the feet. The mside should be 

61 



62 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

washed and rinsed several times in cold water, after every- 
thing has been removed. Remove extra fat, as it tends to 
make the gravy greasy. The heart should be slit open 
and cleansed, also the gizzard, and both should be put by 
themselves to soak in water. 

Roasted or broiled poultry of all kinds should be thor- 
oughly cooked and handsomely browned. It is not easy to 
state exactly the time required for the different sorts to be 
well done. Experience and practice are the only sure 
guides. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Turkey. — A young turkey, weighing not more than 
eight or nine pounds, is the best. Wash and clean thor- 
oughly, wiping dry, as moisture will spoil the stuffing. 
Take one small loaf of bread grated fine, rub into it a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, one small teaspoonful of pep- 
per and one of salt ; a sprinkling of sweet marjoram, sum- 
mer savory, or sage, if liked. Rub all together, and fill the 
turkey, sewing up so that the stuffing cannot cook out. 
Always put the giblets under the side of the fowl, so they 
will not dry up. Rub salt, pepper, and butter on the out- 
side; put into dripping-pan with one teacupful of water, 
basting often, turning the fowl till brown all over; bake 
about two hours ; take out the giblets and chop fine. After 
taking out the turkey, put a large tablespoonful of flour into 
the pan and stir until brown. Put the giblets into a gravy- 
boat, and pour over them the gravy. 

Boiled Turkey. — Stuff the turkey as for roasting. A very 
nice dressing is made by chopping half a pint of oysters 
and mixing them with bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, 
thyme, and wet with milk or water. Baste about the turkey 
a thin cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 
flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt 



POULTRY AND GAME. 63 

in it. Let a large, turkey simmer for three hours ; skim 
while boiling. Serve with oyster sauce, made by adding to 
a cupful of the liquor in which the turkey was boiled the 
same quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped fine ; sea- 
son with minced parsley ; stir in a spoonful of rice or wheat 
flour wet with cold milk ; a tablespoonful of butter. Boil 
up once and pour into a tureen. 

Boned Turkey. — Boil a large tu-rkey in as little water as 
possible until the meat falls from the bones ; remove all the 
bones and skin ; pick the meat into small pieces, and mix 
dark and light together ; season with pepper and salt ; put 
into a mold and pour over it the liquor, which must be kept 
warm, and press with a heavy weight. 

Roast Chicken. — Having selected your chickens in view of 
the foregoing hints, proceed, in the matters of cleansing, 
filling, and preparing for the oven, precisely as directed in 
the case of roast turkey. As the roasting goes on, baste 
and turn as may be needful to secure a rich brown all over 
the fowls. Prepare the gravy as in the former case. 

Stewed Chicken. — Clean and cut the chicken into joints ; 
put it in a saucepan with the giblets ; stew in just enough 
water to cover it until tender ; season with pepper, salt, and 
butter ; thicken with flour ; boil up once and serve with the 
gravy poured over it. 

Broiled Chicken. — Only young, tender chickens are nice 
broiled. After cleaning and washing them, split down the 
back, wipe dry, season with salt and pepper, and lay them 
inside down on a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. 
Broil until nicely browned and well cooked through, watch- 
ing and turning to prevent burning. If chickens are large, 
steaming them for one-half hour before placing on the grid- 
iron will better insure their being cooked through. 



64 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Fricasseed CMckens. — Cut them in pieces, and put in the 
stewpan with salt and pepper ; add a little water, and let 
them boil half an hour ; th^in thicken the gravy with flour ; 
add butter and a little cream, if you have it. Catsup is an 
additional relish to the gravy. 

Smothered CMcken. — Dress your chickens ; wash and let 
them stand in water half an hour to make them white ; cut 
them open at the back; put into a baking-pan, sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them, putting a lump of butter here 
and there ; cover tightly witii another pan the same size, and 
bake one hour ; baste often with butter. 

Fried Chicken. — Prepare the chicken as for stewing ; dry it, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and fry 
brown in hot butter or lard ; take it out, drain, and serve 
with Challenge Sauce, or some other savory condiment, or 
pour into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cup of milk, 
thicken with flour, add a little butter, and season with Sal- 
picant; boil once and pour over the chicken, or serve sepa- 
rately. 

Chickens Fried with Eice. — Take two or three chickens, 
cut them up, and half fry them ; then boil half a pint of rice 
in a quart of water, leaving the grains distinct, but not too 
dry ; stir one large tablespoonful of butter in the rice while 
hot ; let five eggs be well beaten into the rice, with a little 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg, if the last is liked ; put the chick- 
ens into a deep dish, and cover with the rice ; brown in an 
oven not too hot. 

CMcken Pie. — Line the sides of a deep pie-dish with a 
good puff paste. Have your chicken cooked, as for a 
fricassee, seasoned with salt and pepper and a little chopped 
parsley. When they are nearly cooked, lay them in a pie- 
dish with half a pound of salt pork cut into small. squares, 
and some of the paste also cut into half-inch pieces ; pour 



POULTRY AND GAME. gg 

ift a part of the chicken gravy, thicken with a little flour, 
and cover the dish with the paste cover. Cut a hole the 
size of a dollar in the cover, and cover it with a piece of 
dough. When baking, remove this piece occasionally and 
examine the interior. Brush egg over the top crust of the 
pie, and bake in a quick oven. Should the pie become dry 
pour in more of the gravy. Pigeon pie or any other bird 
pie may be made by the above recipe. 

Chicken Pot-pie.-^Cut and joint a large chicken. Cover 
with water, and let it boil gently until tender. Season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour mixed smooth in a piece of butter the size of 
an &^'g. Have ready nice, light bread dough ; cut with a 
biscuit-cutter about an inch thick; drop this into the boiling 
gravy, having previously removed the chicken to a hot 
platter; cover, and let them boil from one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. To ascertain whether they are done, 
stick them with a fork ; if it comes out clean, they are done. 
Lay them on the platter with the chicken, pour over the 
gravy, and serve. 

Pressed Chicken. — Boil three chickens until the meat comes 
off" the bones ; then, removing all bones, etc., chop, not very 
fine ; add a piece of butter as large as an egg, salt and pepper 
to season well. Have about a pint of the broth, into which 
put one-half box gelatine until dissolved ; then put back the 
chopped chicken and cook until the broth is evenly ab- 
sorbed. Press under a weight in a pan until cold. Veal 
may be treated in a similar manner with very excellent 
results. 

Jellied Chicken. — Boil a chicken in as little water as pos- 
sible, until the meat falls from the bones ; chop rather fine, 
and season with pepper and salt ; put in a mold a layer of 
5 



66 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the chopped meat, and then a layer, of hard-boiled eggs cut 
in slices ; then layers of meat and egg alternately until the 
mold is nearly full ; boil down the liquor left in the pot 
one-half; while warm, add one-quarter of an ounce of gela- 
tine, and when dissolved pour into the mold over the meat. 
Sit in a cool place over night to jelly. 

Roast Goose and Duck, — A goose should always be par- 
boiled, as it removes the rank taste and makes it more 
palatable. Clean, prepare, and roast the same as turkey, 
only adding to the force-meat a large onion chopped fine. 
Ducks do not require parboiling (unless very old), otherwise 
they are cooked the same as geese. 

Canvas-back Duck. — Having picked, singed^ and drawn it 
well, wipe it carefully, so as to have it clean without wash- 
ing. Truss it, leaving the head on, to show its quality. 
Place it in a moderately hot oven for at least three-quarters 
of an hour ; serve it hot, in its own gravy, on a large chafing- 
dish. Currant jelly should be on the table. 

Roast Pigeons. — Clean, wash, and stuff the same as poultry; 
lay them in rows in a dripping-pan with a little water. 
Unless they are very fat, baste with butter until they are 
half done, afterward with their own gravy. 

Roast Snipe. — Clean and truss, but do not stuff Lay in 
rows in the dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt, and baste well 
with butter, then with butter and water. When they begin 
to brown, cut as many slices of bread as there are birds. 
Toast quickly, butter, and lay in the dripping-pan, a bird 
upon each. When the birds are done, serve upon the toast, 
with the gravy poured over it. The toast should lie under 
them while cooking at least five minutes, during which time 
the birds should be basted with melted butter seasoned with 
pepper. The largest snipe will not require above twenty

minutes to roast. Or, dip an oyster in melted butter, then 
in bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put in 
each bird before roasting. Small birds are especially de- 
licious cooked in this way. 

Roast Partridges, Pheasants, or Quails. — Pluck, singe, draw, 
and truss them ; season with salt and pepper; roast for about 
half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with butter. 
When done, place on a dish together with bread-crumbs 
fried brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be 
served separately in a tureen. 

Quail on Toast. — Qean, wash, slit down the back, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside 
down. Broil slowly ; when nicely browned, butter well. 
Serve with cream gravy on toast. Omitting the cream, 
gravy, and toast, you have the ordinary broiled quail. 
Pigeons, woodcock, and small birds may be broiled in the 
same manner, and are delicious and nourishing for invalids. 

Fried Rabbit. — After the rabbit has been thoroughly 
cleaned and washed, put it into boiling water and let it boil 
for about ten minutes ; drain, and when cold, cut it into 
joints; dip into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry 
tbem in butter over a moderate fire fifteen minutes ; thicken 
the gravy with an ounce of butter and a small teaspocnful 
of flour. Serve hot. 

Roast Rabbit. — Dress nicely and fill with a dressing made 
of bread-crumbs, a little onion, sage, pepper, and salt, and a 
small piece of butter ; tie a piece of salt pork over it ; put 
into a dripping-pan with a little water in a quick oven ; 
baste often ; serve with currant jelly. 

BroUed Steaks of Venison. — Heat the gridiron, grease it 
well, lay on the steaks ; broil quickly, without scorching,

turning them two or three times; season with salt and 
pepper. Have butter melted in a well-heated platter, into 
which lay steaks, hot from the gridiron, turning them over 
several times in the butter, and serve hot with currant jelly 
on each steak. It is well to set the platter into another 
containing boiling water. 

Game or Poultry in Jelly. — Take a knuckle of veal weighing 
two pounds ; a slice of lean ham ; one shallot, minced ; a 
sprig of thyme and one of parsley ; six pepper-corns (white) 
and one teaspoonful of salt, with three pints of cold water. 
Boil all these together until the liquor is reduced to a pint ; 
strain without squeezing, and set to cool until next day. It 
should then be a firm jelly. Take off every particle of fat. 
Then take one package gelatine, soaked in one cupful cold 
Water for three hours ; one tablespoonful of sugar ; two table- 
spoonfuls strained lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
currant jelly, dissolved in cold water, and strained through 
a muslin cloth. Pour a quart of boiling water over the gela- 
tine, stir for a moment, add the jellied " stock," and when 
this is dissolved, add sugar, lemon juice, and coloring. Stir 
until all are mixed and melted together, and strain without 
shaking or squeezing through a flannel bag until quite clear. 
Have ready several hard-boiled eggs, and the remains of 
roast game, roast or boiled poultry, cut in neat, thin slices, 
and salted slightly. Wet a mold with cold water, and 
when the jelly begins to harden, pour some in the bottom. 
Cut the whites of the eggs in pretty shapes- — stars, flowers, 
rings, leaves — with a keen penknife, and arrange these on 
the lowest stratum of jelly, which should be thin, that the 
forms may be visible. Add more jelly, and on this lay 
slices of meat, close together. More jelly, and proceed in 
this order until the mold is full. Set in a cool place to 
harden, and then turn out upon a flat dish. A mold with 
smooth, upright sides, is best for this purpose.

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 

Gravy for Poultry. — Boil the giblets very tender; chop fine ; 
then take the liquor in which they are boiled, thicken with 
flour ; season with salt, pepper, and a little butter ; add the 
giblets and dripping in which the turkey was roasted. 

Plain Stuffing.— Take stale bread, cut off all the crust, rub 
very fine, and pour over it as much melted butter as will 
make it crumble in your hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 
See also under " Roast Turkey." 

Potato Stuffing.— Take two-thirds bread and one-third 
boiled potatoes grated, butter size of an egg, pepper, salt, 
one egg ; mix thoroughly. 

Oyster Stuffing. — By substituting oysters for potatoes in 
the above, you have oyster filling. See also under " Boiled 
Turkey." 

Stuffing for Boiled Chicken. — One cupful of bread-crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one egg, half a teaspoqnful of 
salt, and one tablespoonful of sweet marjoram. Mix well ; 
stuff and sew in. 

Capons. — Young male fowls, prepared by early gelding, 
and then nicely fattened, are the finest delicacies in the 
poultry line. They may be known by a small head, pale 
comb, which is short and withered, the neck feathers longer 
than usual, smooth legs, and soft, short spurs. They are 
cooked as ordinary chickens. 

Keeping Game. — Game is rendered more tender, and its 
flavor is improved by keeping. If wrapped in a cloth satu- 
rated with equal parts of pyroligneous acid and water, it 
will keep many days. If in danger of tainting, clean, rub 
well with salt, and plunge into boiling water, letting it run 
through them for five minutes ; then hang in a cold place. 
If tainted, put them in new milk over night. Always hang 
them up by the neck.

HOW TO SELECT BEEF J CHOICE ROASTING PIECES, STEAKS, BOIL- 
ING PIECES, SOUP PIECES, ETC. HOW TO ROAST, BROIL, AND 
BOIL BEEF. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING BEEF. 

GOOD beef may be known by its color. That of a 
deep, healthy red, fine, smooth, open grain, veined 
with white, being the best. The fat should be oily, 
smooth, and inclined to white, rather than yellow, as yellow 
fat is a sure sign of inferior quality. 

The sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs and the sirloin are 
considered the choicest cuts for roasting. The inside of the 
sirloin and the rump are the most tender for steaks, though 
here is a point where individual taste may be exercised. 
By some epicures what is known as the pin-bone steak is 
regarded as superior to any other. The round, buttock, 
shin, or brisket may be boiled or stewed. The neck or 
shoulder is generally used for soups, gravy, etc. 

In roasting beef it is necessary to have a brisk fire. The 
roast must be well seasoned with salt and pepper and 
dredged with flour. Baste it frequently. About fifteen 
minutes is required for roasting every pound of beef 

To broil meats well, have the gridiron hot and the bars 
well greased before putting on the meat. 

In boiling beef, or indeed any fresh meat, plunge it into 
boiling water, that the outer parts may contract, and so 
retain the internal juices. Salt meats should be put on in 
cold water, that the salt may be extracted in the cooking. 
In boiling meats, it is important to keep the water constantly

boiling, otherwise the meat will absorb the water. Be 
careful to add boiling water only, if more is needed. Cold 
water will check the process of cooking and spoil the flavor. 
Remove the scum as soon as the boiling commences. Allow 
about twenty minutes boiling for each pound of fresh meat, 
and from one-half to three-quarters of an hour for all salt 
meats, except ham, which requires but fifteen minutes to the 
pound. The more gently all meats boil the more tender 
they will be. Slow boiling makes meat far better. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Bee£ — The best roasting-pieces are the middle ribs 
and the sirloin. The ends of the ribs should be removed 
from the flank, and the latter folded under the beef and 
securely fastened with skewers. Rub a little salt into the 
fat part ; place the meat in the dripping-pan with a pint of 
stock or water ; baste freely, and dredge with flour half an 
hour before taking the joint from the oven. Should the 
oven be very hot, place a buttered paper over the meat to 
prevent it scorching while yet raw. When the paper is 
used it will need very little basting. Or, turn the rib side 
up toward the fire for the first twenty minutes. The time it 
Will take in cooking depends upon the thickness of the joint 
and the length of time the animal has been killed. Skim the 
fat from the gravy and add a tablespoonful of prepared 
brown flour to the remainder. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding.— Take a large rib 
roast ; rub salt and pepper over it, and dredge with flour. 
Place on a rack in a dripping-pan, with very little water, 
until it is heated thoroughly; baste frequently. When 
nicely browned on the upper side, turn and baste. About 
three-quarters of an hour before it is done, take out the 
meat, pour off most of the dripping, put the batter for the 



72 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

pudding in the bottom of the pan, allowing the drippings 
from the beef to drop into it. When the pudding is done, 
return the meat and finish roasting. Add some hot water 
t© the dripping and thicken with flour for the gravy. 

For the batter of this pudding, take half a cup of butter, 
three cups of flour, three eggs, one cup of milk, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of fresh beef, extract the 
bone, and take away the fat. For a round weighing ten 
pounds, make a seasoning or stuffing as follows : Half a 
pound of beef suet ; half a pound of grated bread-crumbs ; 
the crumbled yelks of three hard-boiled eggs; a litde 
bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves chopped ; another of 
sweet basil; four onions minced small; a large tablespoonful 
of mixed mace and nutmeg powdered. Season lightly with 
salt and cayenne. Stuff" this mixture into the place from 
whence you took out the bone. Make a number of deep 
cuts about the meat, and stuff" them also. Skewer the meat 
into a favorable shape, and secure its form by tying it round 
with tape. Put it into a tin bakepan, and pour over it a 
pint of port wine. Put on the lid, and bake the beef slowly for 
five or six hours, or till it is thoroughly done. If the meat 
is to be eaten hot, skim all the fat from the gravy, into 
which, after it is taken off" the fire, stir in the beaten yelks 
of two eggs. Minced oysters may be substituted for onions. 

Spiced Beef.— Boil a shin of beef weighing ten or twelve 
pounds, until the meat falls readily from the bones. Pick 
the meat to pieces, and mash the gristle very fine, rejecting 
all parts that are too hard to mash. Set away the liquor in 
which the beef has boiled till it is cold ; then take off" all the 
fat. Boil the liquor down to a pint and a half Roll a 
dozen crackers very fine, and add them to the meat. Then 
return the meat to the liquor, and heat it all. Add salt and 
pepper to taste,half a teasooonful of cloves, half a teaspoon- 



ME A TS. 



73 



ful of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful oi parsley chopped fine, 
and a little powdered nutmeg. Let it boil up once, and put 
into a mold or deep dish, with a weight adjusted to press 
it down. When it is entirely cold, cut into thin slices. 

Savory Beef. — Take a shin of beef from the hind-quarter, 
saw it into four pieces, put it into a pot, and boil it until the 
meat and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very 
fine, put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. Cut in 
slices and eat cold. 

Minced Beef — Cut cold roast beef into thin slices; put 
some of the gravy into a stewpan, a bit of butter rolled in 
flour, pepper and salt, and boil it up Add a little catsup, 
and put in the minced slices, and heat them through, but do 
not let it boil. Put small slices of toast in the dish, and 
cover with the meat. 

Deviled Beef — Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them on 
hot coals, and broil ; season with pepper and salt, and serve 
while hot, with a small lump of butter on each piece. 

Curried Beef — Take about two ounces of butter and place 
them in a saucepan with two small onions cut up into slices, 
and let them fry till they are of a light brown ; then add a 
tablespoonful and a half of curry powder, and mix it up 
well. Now cut up the beef into pieces about an inch 
square ; pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of milk, 
and let it simmer for thirty minutes ; then take it off and 
place it in a dish with a little lemon juice. While cooking 
stir constantly, to prevent burning. Send it to table with a 
wall of mashed potatoes or rice around it. 

Beef Hasli. — Chop fine cold steak or roast beef, and cook 
in a little water ; add cream or milk, and thicken with flour j 
season to taste, and pour over thin slices of toast. 



74 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

Beef Stew. — Cut cold beef into small pieces, and put into 
cold water ; add one tomato, a little onion, chopped fine ; 
pepper and salt, and cook slowly ; thicken with butter and 
flour, and pour over toast. 

Boiled Corned Beef — Put four or five pounds of lean corned 
meat into a pot with plenty of water. The water should be 
hot. The same care should be taken in skimming as for 
fresh meat. Allow half an hour for every pound of meat 
after it has begun to boil. The excellence of corned beef 
depends very much upon its being boiled gently and long. 
If it is to be eaten cold, lay it, when boiled, into a coarse 
earthen dish or pan, and over it a clean board about the 
size of the meat ; upon this put a heavy weight. Salt meat 
is much improved by pressing. 

Stewed Shin of Beef — Wash, and set it on to stew in suffi- 
cient cold water to keep it just covered until done. When 
it boils, take off the scum, and put an ounce and a quarter 
of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a few cloves 
and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up loosely 
in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a 
bunch of savory herbs, four or five carrots, and as many 
turnips, either whole or sliced ; if to be served with the 
meat, the last two will require a little more than the ordinary 
time of boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with 
the meat from the beginning. Give the beef from four to 
five hours' gentle stewing, and serve it with part of its own 
liquor thickened and flavored, or quite plain. 

Boiled Tongue. — Soak the tongue over night, then boil four 
or five hours. Peel ofif the outer skin and return it to the 
water in which it was boiled to cool. This will render it 
juicy and tender. 

Baked Heart. — Wash carefully and stuff nicely ; roast or 
bake and serve with gravy, which should be thickened with 



MEATS. 75 

some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a little 
port wine added. 

Broiled Beefsteak.— Have the choice steaks cut three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; grease the gridiron and have it 
well heated. Put the steak over a hot, clear fire. When the 
steak is colored, turn it over, which must be done without 
sticking a fork into it and thus letting out the juice. It 
should be quite rare or pink in the centre, but not raw. 
When cooked sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season 
with pepper and salt ; spread over. the top some small bits of 
butter, and serve immediately. Salt extracts the juices of 
meats in cooking. Steaks ought not to be salted until they 
have been broiled. 

Beefeteak with Onions. — Take a nice rumpsteak, and pound 
it with a rolling-pin until it is quite tender ; flour and season ; 
put it into a frying-pan with hot lard and ' fry it When 
well browned on both sides, take it up and dredge with flour. 
Have about two dozen onions ready boiled ; strain them in 
a colander and put them in a frying-pan, seasoning with 
pepper and salt ; dredge in a little flour, and add a small 
lump of butter ; place the pan over the fire and stir the 
onions frequently, to prevent their scorching. When they 
are soft and a little brown, return the steak to the pan, and 
heat all together. Place the steak on a large dish, pour the 
onions and gravy over it, and send to the table hot. 

Beefeteak and Tomatoes. — Stew a dozen good-sized tomatoes 
one hour, with salt and pepper. Then put in a pound of 
tender beefsteak, cut in small pieces, and boil fifteen min- 
utes longer. Lay buttered toast in a deep dish, pour on the 
steak and tomato, and you have a most relishing and 
healthful dish. 

Stuffed Beefeteak. — Take a rump steak about an inch thick. 
Make a stuffing of bread and herbs, and spread it over the 
steak. Roll it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew 



76 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

it together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it 
stew slowly for two hours — longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

Beefeteak Pudding. — Prepare a good suet crust, and line a 
cake tin with it; put in layers of steak, with onions, toma- 
toes and mushrooms chopped, a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and cayenne, and half a teacupful of water before closing it. 
Bake from an hour and a half to two hours, and serve hot. 



II.— VEAL. 



CHOOSING VEAL, FOR ROASTING, FOR STEWING J THE HEAD, 
FEET, KIDNEYS, SWEET-BREADS, ETC.; GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR COOKING VEAL. 

VEAL should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not 
overgrown. When large, it is apt to be coarse and tough, 
and if too young, it lacks flavor and is less wholesome. 
it is more difficult to keep than any meat except pork, and 
should never be allowed to acquire the slightest taint before 
it is dressed. 

The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the 
neck, are the parts preferred for roasting ; the breast and 
knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled. The head and 
feet of the calf are valuable articles of food, both for the 
nutriment which the gelatmous parts of them afford, and for 
the greater variety of modes in which they may be dressed. 
The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, and the 
sweet-breads especially, are well-known delicacies; the 
liver and the heart also are very good eating ; and no meat 
is so generally useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 



MEATS. 77 

The best veal is from calves not less than four, or more 
than six weeks old. If younger it is not wholesome. If 
older its character begins to change materially from the 
calf's use of grasses and other food. 

RECIPES. 

Roast VeaL — Take a loin or fillet of veal ; make a stuffii\g 
as for roast turkey ; fill the flat with the stuffing, and sew it 
firmly to the loin ; rub the veal with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and put it into a pan with a little water. While roasting, 
baste frequently, letting it cook until thoroughly done. 
Allow two hours for a roast weighing from six to eight 
pounds. When done, remove the threads before sending 
to the table ; thicken the gravy with a little flour. Veal 
should be rather overdone. 

Pot-roasted KUet — Remove the bone and fill the cavity 
with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs, a very little salt, 
pork chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt, and ground cloves. 
Lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork ; put in the fil- 
let, fastened with skewers, cover with additional pork, pom- 
over it a pint of good stock, cover down close, and let it 
cook slowly two or three hours ; then take off the cover 
and let it brown. Serve hot. 

Boiled Fillet. — A small and delicately white fillet should 
be selected for this purpose. Bind it round with tape, after 
having washed it thoroughly ; cover it well with cold water, 
and bring it gently to a boil ; clear off carefully the scum 
as it rises, and be very cautious not to allow the water to 
become smoked. Let the meat be gently simmered for three 
hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight. 
Send it to table with rich white sauce. 

Veal Stew. — Cut four or five pounds of veal into strips ; 
peel a dozen large potatoes, and cut them into slices ; place 
a layer of sliced salt pork with salt, pepper, sage, and onion 



78 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

on the bottom of the pot, then a layer of potatoes, then a 
layer of the veal nicely seasoned. Use up the veal thus. 
Over the last layer of veal put a layer of the pork, and 
over the whole a layer of potatoes. Pour in water till it 
covers the whole ; cover the pot closely ; heat it rapidly for 
a few minutes, and then let it simmer two hours. 

Veal Hask-^Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce- 
pan, stir into it an even teaspoonful of flour wet in a table- 
spoonful of cold water, and let it boil five minutes ; add 
one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as much salt, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. 
Chop the veal fine and mix with half as much stale bread- 
crumbs. Put into a pan and pour the gravy over it, then 
let it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast. 

Veal Pie. — Line a pudding-dish with good pie crust ; into 
this put a layer of veal cut into small slices from the neck, 
or other less valuable part ; make a second layer of hard- 
boiled eggs sliced thin ; butter and pepper this layer. Add 
a layer of sliced ham, or salt pork, squeezing a few drops 
of lemon juice on the ham. Add more veal, as before, with 
eggs, ham, etc., till the dish is nearly full. Pour over a 
cupful of stock and cover with a stout crust. Bake in a 
moderate oven for two hours. 

Veal Pot Pie. — Make a crust of a dozen mashed potatoes, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a teacup of milk or cream, 
a little salt, and flour enough to stiffen it nicely. Fry half 
a dozen slices of salt pork, then cut up the veal and boil 
these together, in but little water, till the veal is almost 
done. Peel and slice a dozen potatoes quite thin, and roll 
the dough about half an inch thick and cut it into strips. 
Now build in your pot a layer of crust, meat, potatoes ; then 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then another set of layers, 
and top off with crust. Pour on the liquor in which the 
meat was cooked, and let all simmer for half an hour, or until 



MEATS. 79 

the top crust is cooked. Brown the crust by holding over 
it a red-hot shovel. 

Veal Loaf — Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three 
pounds of raw veal, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, one of 
pepper, and two raw eggs. Chop the veal fine and mix all 
together, and put in about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mold this into a loaf, then roll it in eight tablespoonfuls of 
rolled crackers, and pour over it three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter ; place in a pan and bake two hours. To be 
sliced off when cold, and served at luncheon or tea. 

Veal with Oysters. — Cut the veal in small, thin slices, place 
it in layers in a jar with salt, pepper, and oysters. Pour in 
the liquor of the oysters, set the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water, and let it stew till the meat becomes very tender. 

Veal with Eice. — Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; bring it slowly to a 
boil ; take off all the scum with great care ;. throw in a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and when the joint has simmered for about 
half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve ounces of well- 
washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour and a half 
longer, or until both the meat and rice are perfectly tender. 
A seasoning of cayenne and mace in fine powder, with more 
salt, should it be required, must be added twenty or thirty 
minutes before they are served. For a superior stew, good 
veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal with Peas. — A quart or more of full-grown green 
peas, instead of rice, added to the veal, prepared as above, 
as soon as the scum has been cleared off, will make a most 
excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white 
pepper, and the mace should be omitted. 

Cutlets in Cracker. — Pound the cutlet and season, cut the 
edges into good shape ; take one egg, beat it a little, roll 
the cutlet in it, then cover thoroughly with rolled crackers. 



go 7'HE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Have a lump of butter and lard mixed hot in your skillet ; 
put in the meat and cook slowly. When nicely browned 
stir in one spoonful of flour for the gravy ; add half a pint 
of sweet milk, and let it come to a boil. Salt and pepper. 

Cutlets, Broiled. — Trim evenly ; sprinkle salt and pepper on 
both sides ; dip in melted butter, and place upon the grid- 
iron over a clear fire; baste while broiling with melted 
butter, turn over three or four times ; serve with melted 
butter, or tomato sauce. 

Pressed Veal — But four pounds of veal in a pot ; cover 
with water ; stew slowly until the meat drops from the bone, 
then take out and chop fine ; let the liquor boil down until 
there is a cupful ; put in a small cupful of butter, a table- 
spoonful of pepper, a little allspice, and a beaten egg ; stir 
this through the meat ; slice a hard-boiled egg ; lay in a 
mold, and press in the meat ; when put upon the table gar- 
nish with celery tops or parsley. 

Minced Veal — Heat a cupful of well-thickened gravy to a 
boil ; add two tablespoonfuls of cream or rich milk, one 
tablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt, parsley to taste, a 
small onion, and three eggs well beaten. When these are 
stirred in, add the cold minced meat, salted and peppered. 
Let it heat thoroughly, but not boil. 

Veal Scallops. — Mince the meat very small, and set it over 
the fire ; season with grated nutmeg, pepper and salt, and a 
little cream. Then put it into scallop-shells, and cover with 
crumbs of bread, over which put bits of butter, and brown 
at a quick fire. Serve hot, with catsup or mushroom sauce. 

Calf's Liver or Heart. — Cut the liver in slices, plunge into 
boiling water for an instant, wipe dry, season with pepper and 
salt, dredge with flour, and fry brown in lard. Have it per- 
fectly done. Serve in gravy, made with either milk or water. 
Calf's heart dressed in this way is also very palatable. 



MEATS. ^\ 

Broiled Sweet-breads.— Parboil and blanch the sweet- 
breads by putting them first into hot ivater and keeping it 
at a hard boil for five minutes, then plunging it into ice- 
cold water somewhat salted. Allow them to lie in this ten 
minutes, wipe them very dry, and with a sharp knife split in 
half, lengthwise. Broil over a clear, hot fire, turning when- 
ever they begin to drip. Have ready upon a deep plate 
melted butter, well salted and peppered, mixed with catsup 
or Challenge sauce. When the sweet-breads are done to a 
fine brown lay them in this preparation, turning them over 
several times ; cover and set them in a warm oven. Serve 
on fried bread or toast in a chafing-dish, a piece of sweet- 
bread on each. Pour on the hot butter and send to table. 

Stewed Sweet-breads. — Parboil, blanch, and cut into small 
pieces ; boil fifteen minutes in milk ; stir into this chopped 
parsley, a little butter, and cornstarch to thicken. Serve hot. 

Broiled Kidneys. — Skin the kidneys carefully, but do not 
slice or split them. Lay for ten minutes in warm (not hot) 
melted butter, rolling them over and over, that every part may 
be well basted. Broil on a gridiron over a clear fire, turn 
ing them every minute. Unless very large, they should be 
done in about twelve minutes. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and lay on a hot dish, with butter upon each. 

Calf's Tongue. — Of all the tongue preparations, calf's 
tongue is regarded as best. To pickle them, use for each 
a quarter pound of salt, one ounce of saltpetre, and a quar- 
ter pound of sugar. Rub the tongues daily with this, allow- 
ing them to lie in pickle for two weeks, after which they 
will be ready for smoking or boiling. If used without 
smoking, they require no soaking, but should simmer sev- 
eral hours till perfectly done, when the skin will peel off 
readily. If soaking is needed, lay them first in cold water 
and then in tepid water for two hours each; then boil till 
done.

III.— MUTTON AND LAMB. 

CHOOSING^ MUTTON AND LAMB, FOR ROASTING, FOR BOILING ; 
CUTLETS, SUITABLE VEGETABLES, ETC. THIRTEEN RECIPES FOR 
MUTTON AND LAMB. 

THE best mutton is small-boned, plump, finely grained, 
and short legged ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a 
bright hue, and the fat white and clear ; when this is 
yellow, the meat is rank, and of bad quality. The leg and 
the loin are the desirable joints ; and the preference would 
probably be given to the latter, but for the superabundance 
of its fat, which renders it a somewhat wasteful part. 

The parts for roasting are the shoulder, saddle, or chine, 
the loin, and haunch. The leg is best boiled, unless the 
mutton is young and very tender. The neck is sometimes 
roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that 
part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other 
purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before 
the joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin 
are commonly preferred, but they are frequendy taken from 
the best end of the neck and from the middle of the leg. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. In the fore-quarter, the 
vein in the neck should be blue, otherwise it is stale. In the 
hind-quarter the fat of the kidney will have a slight odor if 
not quite fresh. Lamb soon loses its firmness if stale. 

New potatoes, asparagus, green peas, and spinach, are the 
vegetables to be eaten with roast lamb. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Mutton. — Wash the meat well, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, dredge .with flour, and put in the dripping-pan, 
with a little water in the bottom. Baste often with the drip- 
pings, skim the gravy well, and thicken with flour. 



MEATS. gg 

Boiled Leg of Mutton.— Cut off the shank-bone, trim the 
knuckle, and wash the mutton ; put it into a pot with salt, 
and cover with boiling water. Allow it to boil a few min- 
utes ; skim the surface clean, draw your pot to the side of the 
fire, and simmer until done. Time, from two to two hours 
and a half Do not try the leg with a fork to determine 
whether it is done. You lose the juices of the meat by so 
doing. Serve with caper sauce, or drawn butter, well sea- 
soned. The liquor from this boiling may be converted into 
soup with the addition of a ham-bone and a few vegetables 
boiled together. 

Mutton Dressed like Venison. — Skin and bone a loin of 
mutton, and lay it into a .'tewpan with a pint of water, a 
large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half a pint of port 
wine, and a spoonful of vinegar ; add, when it boils, a little 
thyme and parsley, and some pepper and salt ; let it stew 
three hours, and turn it often. Make some gravy of the 
bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton. 

Broiled Mutton Chops. — Trim off a portion of the fat, or the 
whole of it, unless it be liked ; heat the gridiron, rub it with 
a bit of the mutton suet, broil over a brisk fire, and turn 
often until they are done, which, for the generality of eaters, 
will be in about eight minutes, if the chops are not more 
than half an inch thick, which they should not be. Add 
salt and pepper with melted butter, and serve on a hot 
plate. 

Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a breast of mutton not too 
fat, cut it into small, square pieces, dredge it with flour, and fry 
to a fine brown in butter ; add pepper and salt, cover it with 
water, and set it over a slow fire to stew, until the meat is 
perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from 
the gravy, and just before serving add a quart of young 
peas, previously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the 
whole boil gently until the peas are entirely done.

Irish Stew. — Blanch three pounds of mutton chops by dip- 
ping them first in boiHng water, for two or three minutes, 
and then into ice-cold water. Place them on the bottom of 
a clean stewpan, barely covering them with cold water. 
Bring them slowly to a boil ; add one teaspoonful of salt ; 
skim clean ; add a little parsley, mace, and a few pepper- 
corns. Simmer twenty minutes ; add a dozen small onions 
"Krhole, and two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed well with cold 
water. Let it simmer for an hour ; add a dozen potatoes 
pared and cut to about the size of the onions. Boil till 
these are done ; then dish, placing the chops around the 
edge of the plate, and pouring the onions and potatoes into 
tlie centre. Strain the gravy, add three tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, and pour over the stew. 

Boiled Leg of Lamb. — Choose a ewe leg, as there is more 
fat on it; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap, and the thick 
skin on the back of it ; soak in warm water for three hours, 
then boil gently (time according to size). Serve with oyster 
sauce. (See Sauces.) 

Roast Lamb. — Wash well, season with pepper ana salt, put 
in the dripping-pan with a little water. Baste often with 
the dripping ; skim the gravy well and thicken with flour. 

Lamb Stewed in Butter. — Select a nice loin, wash well, and 
wipe very dry ; skewer down the flap, and lay it in a close-shut- 
ting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three ounces 
of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to 
boil ; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two 
hours and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than 
half done. Lift it out, skim, and pour the gravy over it ;: 
send to table with brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad. 

Saddle of Lamb. — This is a dainty joint for a small party.. 
Sprinkle a little salt over it, and set it in the dripping-pan, 
with a few small pieces of butter on the meat; baste it 



MEATS. 86 

•ccasionally with tried-out Iamb-fat; dredge a little flour 
over it a few minutes before taking from the oven. Serve 
with currant jelly and a few choice early vegetables. Mint- 
sauce may be served with the joint, but in a very mild form. 
(See Sauces.) 

Broiled Lamb Chops. — Trim off most of the fat ; broil over 
a brisk fire, turning frequently until the chops are nicely 
browned. Season with pepper and salt, and baste with hot 
butter. Serve on a buttered dish. 

Breaded Lamb Chops. — Grate plenty of stale bread, season 
with jalt and pepper, have ready some well-beaten egg,' have 
a spider with hot lard ready, take the chops one by one, dip 
into the egg, then into the bread-crumbs ; repeat it, as this 
will be found an improvement; then' lay the chops sep- 
arately into the boiling lard, fry brown, and then turn. To 
be eaten with currant jelly. 

Lamb Steaks, Pried. — Dip each steak into well-beaten egg, 
cover with bread-crumbs or corn-meal, and fry in butter or 
new lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled rice are a necessary 
accompaniment. The gravy may be thickened with flour 
and butter, adding a little lemon jiiice ; pour this hot upon 
the steaks, and place the rice in spoonfuls around the dish 
to garnish it. 

IV.— PORK. 

PORK RKQUIRES CAREFUL CHOOSING; NEEDS THOROUGH COOK- 
ING. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING PORK. 

PORK, more than any other meat, requires to be chosen 
with the greatest care. The pig, from its gluttonous 
habits, is particularly liable to disease, and if killed 
and eaten when in an unhealthy condition, those who par- 
take of it will probably pay dearly for their indulgence. 
Dairy-fed pork is the, best. 



86 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

If this meat be not thoroughly well-done, it is disgusting 
to the sight and poisonous to the stomach. " In the gravy 
of pork, if there is the least tint of redness," says an emi- 
nent medical authority, " it is enough to appall the sharpest 
appetite. Other meats under-done may be unpleasant, but 
pork is absolutely uneatable." 

RECIPES. 

Roast Pig. — A fat pig about three weeks old is best for a 
roast. Wash it thoroughly inside and out ; chop the liver 
fine with bread-crumbs, onions, parsley, pepper, salt, and 
potatoes boiled and mashed ; make it into a paste with but- 
ter and egg. Put this stuffing into the pig and sew it up ; 
put in a baking-pan with a little water and roast over a 
bright fire, basting well with butter; rub frequently also 
with a piece of lard tied in a clean rag. When thoroughly 
done, lay the pig, back up, in a dish, and put a red apple or 
pickled-mango in its mouth. Make a dressing with some 
of the stuffing, with a glass of wine and some of the drip- 
ping. Serve with the roast pig, and also in a gravy-boat. 

Roast Pork. — Choose for roasting, the loin, the leg, the 
saddle, the fillet, the shoulder, or the spare-rib. The loin 
of young pork is roasted with the skin on, and this should 
be scored in regular strips of about a quarter inch wide 
before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of the leg 
also should be cut through in the same manner. This will 
prevent blistering, and render it more easy to carve. In 
beginning the roasting the meat should be placed at some 
distance from the fire, in order that it may be heated through 
before the skin hardens. The basting should be constant. ' 
The cooking must be thorough and the meat well-browned 
before removed from the fire. 

Roast Spare-rib. — Spare-rib should be well rubbed with 
salt and pepper before it is roasted. If large and thick, it 



MEATS. 37 

will require two or three hours to roast ; a very thin piece 
may be roasted in an hour. Lay the thick end to the fire. 
When you put it down to roast, dust on some ilour, and 
baste with a little butter. The shoulder, loin, and chine are 
roasted, in the same manner. 

Leg of Pork Roasted.— Parboil a leg of pork, take off "the 
skin, and then roast ; baste with butter, and make a savory 
powder of finely minced or dried or powdered sage, ground 
black pepper, salt, and some bread-crumbs rubbed together 
through a colander ; add to this a little very finely minced 
onion ; sprinkle the meat with this when it is almost done ; 
put a half pint of gravy into the dish. 

Baked Pork Tenderloins. — Split the tenderloin lengthwise 
nearly through ; stuff with a filling of bread-crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, and sweet marjoram. Tie a string around it, to 
keep the filling in, and bake in a hot oven for half an hour, 
basting well as the cooking proceeds. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut them about half an inch thick from a 
delicate loin of pork, trim into neat form, and take off part 
of the fat, or the whole of it when it is not liked ; dredge a 
little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil (or fry) over 
a clear and moderate fire from fifteen to. eighteen minutes, 
sprinkle a little fine salt upon them just before they are 
dished. They may be dipped into egg and then into bread- 
crumbs mixed with minced sage, then finished in the usual 
way. When fried, flour them well, and season with salt and 
pepper. Serve with gravy made in the pan. 

Boiled Ham. — The soaking which must be given to a ham 
before it is boiled depends both on the manner in which it 
has been cured and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and 
old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to 
open the pores sufficiently and to extract a portion of the 
salt. The water must be several times changed during the 
steeping. After the ham has been scraped or brushed as 



88 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR V. 

clean as possible, pare away lightly any part which may be 
blackened or rusty. Lay it into a suitable kettle and cover 
it plentifully with cold water ; bring it very slowly to boil, 
and clear off the scum, which will be thrown up in great 
abundance So soon as the water has been cleared from 
this, draw the pot to the edge of the stove, that the ham 
may be simmered slowly but steadily, until it is tender. On 
no account allow it to boil fast. When it can be probed 
very easily with a sharp skewer, lift it out, strip off the skin, 
and return the ham to the water to cool. 

Baked Ham. — A ham of sixteen pounds must be boiled 
three hours, then skin and rub in half a pound of brown 
sugar, cover with bread-crumbs, and bake well for two 
hours. 

Glazed Ham. — Take a cold-boiled ham from which the skin 
has been removed, and brush it well all over with beaten 
egg. To a cup of powdered cracker allow enough rich 
milk or cream to make into a thick paste, salt it, and work 
in a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this evenly, a 
quarter of an inch thick, over the ham, and set to brown in 
a moderate oven. 

Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham in very thin slices, and fry- 
long enough to cook the fat, but not long enough to crisp 
the lean, A very little boiling water may be put into the 
frying-pan to secure the ham moist and tender. Remove 
the ham when it is done, break eggs gently into the pan, 
without breaking the yelks, and fry till done, about three 
minutes. The eggs will not require to be turned. Cut off 
the uneaven edges, place the eggs around the ham, and pour 
in the gravy. 

Ham or Tongue Toast. — Toast a thick slice of breaci ana 
butter it on both sides. Take a small quantity of remains ' 
of ham or tongue, grate it, and put jt in a stewpan with two 



MEATS. 89 

hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and mixed with a little but- 
ter, salt, and cayenne ; heat it quite hot, then spread thickly 
upon the buttered toast. Serve while hot. 

Broiled Salt Pork. — Cut the pork in thin slices. Put a lit- 
tle water in the pan, and when it has boiled three minutes 
pour it off; dredge the pork with flour and brown it. 

Bacon Broiled or Fried. — Cut evenly into thin slices, or rash- 
ers ; pare from them all rind and rust; curl them round; 
fasten them with small, slight skewers, then gently fry, broil, 
or toast them ; draw out the skewers before they are sent to 
table. A few minutes will dress them either way. They 
may be cooked without being curled. The slow cooking is 
necessary that the meat may be well done without being 
dried or hardened. 

Fried Sausage. — Sausages should be used while quite fresh. 
Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a clean frying-pan ; 
when just melted, put in the sausages, shake the pan for a 
minute, and keep turning them ; do not break or prick 
them ; fry them over a very slow fire till they are nicely 
browned ; when done, lay them on a hair-sieve before the 
fire to drain the fat from them. The secret of cooking sau- 
sages well is to let them heat very gradually. If so done 
the skins will not burst if they are fresh. The common 
practice of pricking them lets the gravy out, which is un- 
desirable. 

Baked Sausages. — The niost wholesome way to cook sau- 
sages is to bake them. Place them in a baking-pan in a 
single layer, and bake in a moderate oven ; turn them over 
when half done, that they may be equally browned. Serve 
with pieces of toast, between them, having cut the toast 
about the same size as the sausage, and moistened it with a 
little of the sausage fat. 

Sausage Meat — Many prefer to use sausage meat in bulk. 



90 • THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Small portions of the meat should be packed lightly to- 
gether and fried slowly until nicely browned. When done, 
drain through a hair-sieve. Do not pack hard. It will 
make the sausages tough. 

Scrappel. — Boil a hog's head one day, and let it stand five 
or six hours, or all night. Slip out the bones and chop 
fine ; then return the meat to the liquor ; skim when cold ; 
warm and season freely with pepper, salt, sage, and sweet 
herbs. Add two cupfuls of buckwheat-meal and one cup- 
ful of corn-meal. Put into molds, and when cold cut into 
slices and fry for breakfast. ' '_ 

Boiled Pork. — The shoulder or leg are regarded as the 
most economical pieces for boiling. They sjibuld be well 
salted first, by about ten days' pickling. Boil precisely as 
ham is boiled, but not for so long a time, about three hoUrs 
suflScing to thoroughly cook an ordinary sized leg of pork. 
After it has come to the boiling point, let the process pro- 
ceed slowly as possible. Peel off the skin when done and 
spot the surface with dashes of red and black pepper, 'or 
with allspice, or garnish with parsley. 

Souse. — Pigs' feet and ears may be soused by cleaning 
thoroughly, soaking in s^t and water several days, and then 
boiling till the bones can be picked out with ease and the 
skin peeled off Cover the meat and gelatinous substance 
with boiling vinegar, highly spiced with peppercorns and 
mace. This may be eaten cold or the meat may be fried 
after dipping in egg and cracker. 

Pig's head may be prepared the same way, the meat being 
chopped fine and mixed with pounded crackers. Mix with 
herbs, spices, salt, and pepper to taste, and a small quantity 
of vinegar. Press into a mold, or a jar, and cut in slices. 
To be eaten cold.

HOW TO COOK WELL, AND IMPORTANCE OF SO DOING — SUITABLE 
POTS FOR COOKING VEGETABLES — VEGETABLES SUITABLE TO 
CERTAIN MEATS. FIFTY-FIVE RECIPES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

ALL vegetables should be used when fresh as possible. 
Wash them thoroughly, and allow them to lie in cold 
water until ready to be used. 

Great care must be taken to remove gravel and insects 
from heads of lettuce, cabbage, and cauliflower. To do 
this, lay them for half an hour or more in a pan of strong 
brine, placing the stalk ends uppermost. This will destroy 
the small snails and other insects which cluster in the 
leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the bottom. 

Strong-flavored vegetables, like turnips, cabbage, and 
greens, require to be put into a large quantity of water. 
More delicate vegetables, such as peas, asparagus, etc., 
"require less water. As a rule, in boiling vegetables, let the 
water boil before putting them in, and let it continue to 
boil until they are done. Nothing is more indigestible than 
vegetables not thoroughly cooked. Just when they are 
done must be ascertained to a certainty in each particular 
case, without depending upon any general directions. 

Never let boiled vegetables stand in the water after com- 
ing off the fire ; put them instantly into a colander over a 
pot of boiling water, and let them remain there, if you have 
to keep them back from the table. 

An iron pot will spoil the color of the finest greens ; they 
should be boiled by themselves in a tin^ brass, or copper 

vessel. 

91 



92 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Potatoes are good with all meats. Carrots, parsnips, tur- 
nips, greens, and cabbage belong with boiled meats ; beets, 
peas, and beans are appropriate to either boiled or roast. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled WMte Potatoes. — Peel off a strip about a quarter of 
an inch wide, lengthwise, around each potato. Put them 
on in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it. Let them 
boil fifteen minutes, then pour off half the water and replace 
it with cold water. When the edge of the peel begins to 
curl up they are done. Remove them from the pot, cover 
the bottom of a baking-tin with them, place them in the 
oven, with a towel over them, for fifteen minutes, leaving 
the oven door open. Then serve with or without the skins. 

The use of cold water in boiling potatoes, as in this recipe, 
is exceptional. Hot water is generally used, but for this 
purpose cold seems preferable. 

Roasted White Potatoes. — Select the largest and finest 
potatoes for roasting. Wash them thoroughly and put in 
the oven with their skins on. Roast about one hour, turn- 
ing them occasionally with a fork. When done, send them 
to the table hot, and in their skins. 

Potatoes Roasted with Meats. — To roast potatoes with beef, 
poultry, and other meats, peel the potatoes, lay them in a 
pan, and cook them in the gravy. It is quite proper to 
roast both white and sweet of potatoes in the same pan. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Steam or boil pared potatoes until soft, 
in salted water ; pour off the water arid let them drain per- 
fectly dry; sprinkle with salt and mash; have ready hot 
milk or cream, in which has been melted a piece of butter ;■ 
pour this on the potatoes, and stir Until white and very light. 
A solid, heavy masher is not desirable. An open wire tool 
is much better. 



VEGETABLES. 93 

Stewed Potatoes.— Take sound raw potatoes, and divide 
each into four parts., or more, if they be very large. Put 
them into the stewpan ; add salt, pepper, and a piece of 
fresh butter; pour in milk, with a little cream, just to keep 
the potatoes from burning. Cover the saucepan, and allow 
the potatoes to stew until thoroughly soft and tender. 

Fried Potatoes. — Boil some good and large potatoes until 
nearly done; set them aside a few minutes; when suffi- 
ciently cool, slice or chop them ; sprinkle them with pepper 
and salt, and fry in butter or fresh lard until they are of a 
light brown color. Serve hot. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel and slice the potatoes on a slaw- 
cutter, into cold water ; wash them thoroughly, and drain ; 
spread between the folds of a clean cloth, rub and pat until 
dry. Fry a few at a time in boiling lard ; salt as you take 
them out. Saratoga potatoes are very nice when eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, 
and if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 
They may be used for garnishing game and steaks. 

Potato Cakes. — Mash thoroughly a lot of potatoes just 
boiled ; add a little salt, butter and cream ; fry brown on 
both sides, after making into little cakes. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. — Take large, fine potatoes, wash 
clean ; boil with the skins on in plenty of water, but without 
salt. They will take at least one hour. Drain off the water, 
and set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before the fire, 
or in the oven, that they may be well dried. Peel them be- 
fore sending to the table. 

Roasted Sweet Potatoes. — Sweet potatoes are roasted in the 
same manner as white, but they require a little longer time. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. — Choose large potatoes, half boil 
them, and then, having taken off the skins, cut the potatoes 
in slices and fry in butter, or in nice drippings. 



94 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

Stewed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water on the tomatoes to 
be used, and then peel and slice them. Stew them gently, 
without adding any water, fifteen minutes ; then add some 
pulverized cracker or bread crumbs, sufficient to thicken it 
a little, and salt and pepper to your taste. Stew fifteen min- 
utes longer, and add a large piece of butter. 

The thickening suggested is not essential. Many prefer 
the pure tomatoes. Try both ways and adopt the more 
pleasing. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Cut large tomatoes in two, from side to 
side, not from top to bottom ; place them on a gridiron, the 
cut surface down ; when well seared, turn them and put on 
butter, salt, and pepper ; then cook with the skin side down 
until done. 

Pried Tomatoes. — Cut the tomatoes in slices without skin- 
ning ; pepper and salt them well ; then sprinkle a little flour 
over them and fry in butter until browned. Put them on a 
hot platter ; then pour milk or cream into the butter and 
juice, and when this is boiling hot, pour it over the tomatoes. 

Tomatoes Baked Whole. — Select a number of sound, ripe 
tomatoes. Cut a round hole in the stem side of each, and 
stuff it with bread-crumbs, nicely peppered and salted ; cover 
the bottom of the pan with the tomatoes, the opened side 
upward ; put in a very little water, dredge with flour, and 
bake till brown. Serve hot. 

Baked Sliced Tomatoes.— Skin the tomatoes, slice in small 
pieces ; spread a thick layer in the bottom of a pudding 
dish ; cover with a thin layer of bread-crumbs, and sprinkle 
salt, pepper, and a few small pieces of butter over them ; 
add another layer of tomatoes, then of ■ crumbs, etc., until 
the dish is filled ; sprinkle over the top a layer of fine rolled 
crackers ; bake one hour. Canned tomatoes, put up whole, 
may be used nicely this way. 



VEGETABLES. 96 

Tomatoes a la Creme. — Pare and slice ripe tomatoes ; one 
pound of fresh ones or a quart can ; stew until perfectly 
smooth, season with salt and pepper, and add a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg. Just before taking from the fire, stir 
in one cup of cream, with a tablespoonful of flour stirred 
smooth in a part of it ; do not let it boil after the flour is put 
in. Have ready in a dish some pieces of toast ; pour the 
tomatoes over this and serve. 

Boiled Green Com. — Take off" the outside leaves and the 
silk, letting the innermost leaves remain on until after the 
corn is boiled, which renders the corn much sweeter. Boil 
for half an hour in plenty of water, drain, and after fully re- 
moving the leaves, serve. 

BaJked Com. — Grate one dozen ears of sweet corn, one cup 
of milk, a small piece of butter ; salt to taste, and bake in a 
pudding dish for one hour. 

Corn Fritters, see Fritters. 

Lima Beans. — Shell, wash, and put into boiling water; 
when boiled tender, drain and season them. Dress with 
cream, or with a large lump of butter, and let the whole 
simmer for a few moments before serving. 

SuccotasL — Take ten ears of green corn and one pint of 
Lima beans ; cut the corn from the cob, and stew gently 
with the beans until tender. Use as little water as possible. 
Season with butter, salt, and pepper — milk, if you choose. 
If a few of the cobs are stowed in the succotash, it will 
improve the flavor, as there is great sweetness in the cob. 

String Beans. — Remove the strings of the beans with a 
knife, and cut off both ends. Cut each bean into three 
pieces, boil tender, add butter when they are done, pepper 
and sa,lt, and. serve hot. 

Boiled B^ns.^Dried beans must soak over night in soft 
water; put them in a strong bag, leaving room for them to

swell ; let them boil in a plenty of water until done ; hang 
up the bag that all the water may drain off; then season 
with butter, pepper, and salt to the taste. 

Baked Beans. — Put the beans to soak early in the evening, 
in a dish that will allow plenty of water to be used. Change 
the water at bed-time. Next morning early, parboil two 
hours ; pour off nearly all fehe water; take raw pork, scored 
on top ; put the beans in a deep dish, a stoneware jar is very 
nice, the pork in the middle, sinking it so as to have it just 
level with the surface. Add half a teaspoonful of soda, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, and bake at least six hours. As 
the beans bake dry, add more water, a little at a time, until 
the last hour, when it is not necessary to moisten them. 

Boiled Green Peas. — The peas should be young and freshly 
shelled ; wash and drain them carefully ; put them into fast- 
boiling, salted water ; when quite tender drain, and add pep- 
per, butter, and a little milk. Serve hot. 

Boiled Asparagus. — Scrape the stems of the asparagus 
lightly, but make them very clean, throwing them into cold 
water as you proceed. When all are scraped, tie them in 
bunches of equal size ; cut the hard ends evenly, that all 
may be of the same length, . and put into boiling water. 
Prepare several slices of delicately browned toast half an 
inch thick. When the stalks are tender, lift them out and 
season with pepper and salt. Dip the toast quickly into the 
liquor in which the asparagus was boiled, and dish the veg- 
etable upon it, the points, or the butts, meeting in the cen- 
tre of the dish. Pour rich melted butter over it, and send 
to the table hot. 

Boiled Beets. — Wash, but do not cut thiem, as cutting de- 
stroys the sweetness ; let them boil from two to three hours, 
or until they are perfectly tender ; then take them up, peel 
and slice them, and pour vinegar, or melted butter, over 
them, as may be preferred. 



VEGETABLES. 97 

Boiled Turnips. — Pare and cut into pieces ; put them into 
boiling water well salted, and boil until tender ; drain thor- 
oughly and then mash and add a piece of butter, pepper, 
and salt to taste. Stir until they are thoroughly mixed, and 
serve hot. 

Boiled Onions. — Skin them carefully and put them to boil ; 
when they have boiled a few minutes, pour off the water, 
add clean cold water, and then set them to boil again. 
Pour this away also, and add more cold water, when they 
may boil till done. This change of waters will make them 
white and clear, and very mild in flavor. After they are 
done, pour off all the water, and dress with a little cream, 
salt, and pepper to taste. 

Fried Onions. — Peel and slice fresh, solid onions very

Boiled Greens. — Turnip-tops, mustard-tops, cabbage-leaves, 
beet-tops, cowslips, dandelions, and various similar articles 
are much relished in the spring, boiled in salt and water or 
with salt pork. When done sufficiently they will sink to 
the bottom. 

Stewed Celery. — Clean the heads thoroughly ; take off the 
coarse, green, outer leaves ; cut the stalks into small pieces, 
and stew in a little broth ; when tender, add some rich 
cream, a little flour, and butter enough to thicken the 
cream. Season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, if 
that is agreeable. 

Boiled Artichokes. — Soak the artichokes and wash them in 
several waters ; cut the stalks even ; trim away the lower 
leaves, and the ends of the other leaves; boil in salted 
water with the tops downward, and let them remain until 
the leaves can be easily drawn out. Before serving, remove 
the surrounding leaves, and send the remainder to the table 
with melted butter.

sauce. If it is too thick, add some cold water by teaspoon- 
fuls at a time. Let all simmer for ten minutes longer. 
Sprinkle some grated cheese over your macaroni, which 
must be piping hot, in a dish. Pour the sauce over this and 
serve. A quarter of a pound, of macaroni makes a large 
dish, and takes about a third of a can to half a can of 
tomatoes.

VII.— SALADS AND SAUCES. 

SALADS DEFINED — HOW DRESSED, COMBINED, AND SERVED. 
SAUCES DEFiNED — THEIR USES AND COMPOSITION. HOW TO 
PREPARE INGREDIENTS FOR SALADS, WHAT VEGETABLES TO 
EMPLOY, FRESHNESS, EXCELLENCE, ETC. FORTY-SIX RECIPES 
FOR SALADS AND SAUCES. 

UNDER the head of salads all preparations of uncooked 
herbs or vegetables is placed. They are usually 
dressed with salt, vinegar, oil, and spices. Sometimes 
they are combined with meat or shell fish, as chicken, veal, 
lobster, etc. They are used chiefly as relishes with other 
food. 

Sauces are generally used to impart a relish to articles 
of food. Sometimes vegetables are employed as the basis 
of sauces, but they are compounded chiefly of savory con- 
diments, that they may add zest to eating. 

Meat or fish used in salads should not be minced, but 
rather picked apart, or cut in pieces of moderate size. Cab- 
bage, celery, asparagus, cauliflower, water-cress, and all 
kinds of lettuce are the vegetables best adapted for use in 
salads. They must be used when quite fresh and crisp, and 
all the ingredients used in their dressing must be of the 
best quality and flavor. 

All condiments are in some sense sauces, but the term is 
usually confined to those which are the result of compound^ 
ing a variety of articles.

VIII.— CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 

CROQUETTES DEFINED ; FRITTERS DEFINED J USES OF BOTH. 
TWENTY-FOUR RECIPES FOR CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 

1 

THE term croquette (pronounced cro-ket) is from a French 
verb, meaning " to crunch." It designates all that class 
of preparations made of minced meat, or other in- 
gredients, highly seasoned and fried in bread-crumbs. 

Fritters, like croquettes, are fried, but they are made of 
batter containing other ingredients, as taste may dictate. 
Both these preparations are used as accessories of the din- 
ner or tea table rather than as principal dishes. 

RECIPES. 

Eice Croq^uettes. — Put a quarter of a pound oi rice into a 
pmt of milk. Let it simmer gently until the rice is tender 
and the milk absorbed. It must then be boiled until thick 
and dry, or it will be difficult to mold. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one of butter, one egg, aijd flavor to taste 
with vanilla or cinnamon ; beat thoroughly for a few minutes, 
and when cold form into balls or cones, dip these into 
beaten egg, roll lightly in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot butter. 

Hommy Croquettes. — To a cupful of cold boiled hominy 
(small grained) add a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir 
hard; moisten by degrees with a cupful of milk, beating to a 
soft, light paste. Put in a teaspoonful of white sugar and a 
well-beaten &g'g. Roll into oval balls with floured hands, 
dip in beaten Q^'g, then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard.

Potato Croquettes. — Season cold mashed potatoes with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Beat to a cream, with a tablespdon- 
ful of melted butter to every cupful of potato. Add two or 
three beaten eggs and some minced parsley. Roll into small 
balls; dip in beaten egg, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in 
hot lard. 

Oyste^Plallt Croquettes. — Wash, scrape, and boil the oyster- 
plant till tender ; rub it through a colander, and mix with 
the pulp a little butter, cream, salt, cayenne, and lemon juice; 
mix the ingredients thoroughly together to a smooth paste, 
and set the dish in the ice-box to get cold ; then shape it 
into small cones, dip them in beaten egg, roll in crumbs, 
and fry crisp and brown. 

Chicken Croquettes. — Add to the quantity of minced chicken; 
about one-quarter the quantity of bread-crumbs, also one 
egg well beaten to each cupful of meat ; pepper, salt, and 
chopped parsley to taste, add the yelks of two hard-boiled 
eggs rubbed smooth. Add gravy or drawn butter to moisten 
it, make into cones or balls, roll in cracker-dust or flour, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Veal Croquettes. — Make these the same as chicken cro- 
quettes, by substituting for the chicken cold minced veal and 
ham in equal parts. The salt may be omitted, as the 
ham usually supplies it sufficiently. Turkey, duck, or the 
remains of any cold game or meat may be used in the same 
way with very satisfactory results. 

Oyster Croquettes. — Take the hard ends of the oysters, leav- 
ing the other end for a soup or stew ; scald them, then chop 
fine, and add an equal weight of potatoes rubbed through a 
colander ; to one pound of this combination add two ounces 
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pep- 
per, half a teaspoonful of mace, and one-half gill of cream, 
make in small rolls, dip them in c^% and grated bread, fry 
in deep, hot lard.

eggs, one and one-half cups of milk, salt and pepper to taste, 
and flour enough to hold all together. Fry in hot fat. 

Homiay Fritters. — Two teacupfuls of cold boiled hominy ; 
stir in one teacupful of sweet milk and a little salt, four table- 
spoonfuls of sifted flour, and one egg ; beat the white sepa- 
rately and add last ; drop the batter by spoonfuls in hot lard

into cakes and fry in hot lard. 

Fruit Fritters. — The following recipe will serve for many 
kinds of fruit or vegetable fritters : Make a batter of ten 
ounces of flour, half a pint of milk, and two ounces of but- 
ter ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; stif in the whites of two 
eggs well beaten ; dip the fruit in the batter and fry. Small 
fruit and vegetables should be mixed with the batter. 

Apple Fritters. — Take one egg, two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
a little sifted sugar and ginger, with rnilk enough to make 
a smooth batter ; cut a good sized apple into slices and put

Oyster Fritters. — Take one and one-half pints of sweet 
milk, one and one-fourth pounds of flour, four egg (the yelks 
having been beaten very thick) ; add milk and flour ; stir 
the whole well together, then beat the whites to a stiff froth 
and stir them gradually into the batter ; take a spoonful of 
the mixture, drop an oyster into it, and fry in hot lard ; let 
them be a light brown on both sides.

IX.— EGGS. 



tJUTRITIOUS VALUE OF EGGS — TEST OF FRESHNESS — PACKING EGGS 
— PRESERVING EGGS. TWENTY-EIGHT WAYS OF COOKING EGGS. 

HIGH chemical authorities agree that there is more nutri- 
ment in an egg than in any substance of equal bulk 
found in nature or produced by art. They are much 
used for food the world over, and few articles are capable 
of more varied employment. 

The freshness of an egg may be determined in various 
ways. In a fresh egg, the butt end, if touched on the 
tongue, is sensibly warmer than the point end. If held to- 
ward the light and looked through (" candled "), a fresh egg 
will show a clear white and a well-rounded yelk. A stale 
egg will appear muddled. Probably the surest test is to put 
the eggs into a pan of cold water. Fresh eggs sink quickly ; 
bad eggs float; suspicious ones act suspiciously, neither 
sinking nor floating very decidedly. Of all articles of food, 
doubtful eggs are most certainly to be condemned. 

On the packing of eggs, the following conclusions may 
be regarded as established among egg-dealers : By cold 
storage, temperature forty to forty-two degrees Fahrenheit, 
kept uniform, with eggs packed properly or in cases, they 
will keep in good condition from six to nine months ; but 
they must be used soon after being taken out of the cold 
storage, as they soon spoil. Eggs become musty from being 
packed in bad material. They will become musty in cases, 
as a change of temperature causes the eggs to sweat and 
the wrapping-paper to become moist and taint the eggs. 

117 



118 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Well-dried oats, a year old, makes the best packing. Eggs 
become " mixed " by jarring ia shipping. Fresh eggs mix 
worse than those kept in cold storage. Eggs which have 
been held in cold storage in the West should be shipped in 
refrigerator cars in summer. Eggs will keep thirty days 
longer if stood on the little end than in any other position. 
They must be kept at an even temperature and in a pure 
atmosphere. Eggs laid on the side attach to the shell and 
are badly injured. To prevent imposition as to the freshness 
of the eggs, the egg gatkerers should " candle " them when 
they get them from the farmers. Eggs keep better in the 
dark than in the light. 

Methods of preservation for domestic purposes are, to 
pack them in bran or salt, the small end down ; to grease 
them with linseed oil, or dip them in a light varnish. For 
extra long keeping, slack one pound of lime in a gallon of 
water ; when this is entirely cold, place it in a jar and fill 
with fresh eggs. Do not agitate the contents when eggs 
are removed from the jar. Eggs kept so will continue good 
for a year. 

The French method of preserving eggs is to dissolve 
beeswax and olive oil and anoint the eggs all over. If left 
undisturbed in a cool place, they will remain good for two 
years. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled Eggs. — Put into a saucepan of boiling water with a 
tablespoon, being careful not to break or crack them. Boil 
steadily three minutes, if you want them soft ; ten, if hard. 

Another way is to put them on in cold water, and let it 
come to a boil. The inside, white and yelk, will be then of 
the consistency of custard. 

Still another way is to put them in water, heated to the 
boiling point, and let them stand from five to seven minutes 
without boiling. If desired for salad, boil them ten minutes ; 



EGGS. 119 

then throw them in cold water ; roll them gently on a table 
or board, and the shell can be easily removed. Wire egg 
racks, to set in boiling hot water with the eggs held in place, 
are exceedingly convenient. 

Boiled Eggs, with Sauce. — Boil hard, remove the shell, set 
in a hot dish, and serve with seasoning and sauce to taste. 

Poached E^s. — Have the water well salted, but do not let 
it boil hard. Break the eggs separately into a saucer, and 
slip them singly into the water ; when nicely done, remove 
with a skimmer, trim neatly, and lay each egg upon a small 
thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with . salt and 
pepper. Some persons prefer them poached rather than' 
fried with ham ; in which case substitute the ham for toast. 

Poached Eggs with Ham Sauce. — Mince fine two or three 
slices of boiled ham, a small onion, a little parsley, pepper, 
and salt ; stew together for a quarter of an hour ; put the 
poached eggs in a dish, squeeze over them the juice of a 
lemon, and pour on the sauce hot but not boiling. 

Poached Eggs a la Creme. — Nearly fill a clean frying-pan 
with water boiling hot ; strain a tablespoonful of vinegar 
through double muslin, and add to the water with a little 
salt. Slip your eggs from the saucer upon the top of the 
water (first taking the pan from the fire). Boil three min- 
utes and a half; drain, and lay on buttered toast in a hot 
dish. Turn the water from the pan and pour in half a cup- 
ful of cream or milk. If you use the latter, thicken with a 
very little corn-starch. Let it heat to a boil, stirring to pre- 
vent burning, and add a great spoonful of butter, some pep^ 
per, and salt Boil up once and pour over the eggs. Or 
better still, heat the milk in a separate saucepan, that the 
eggs may not have to stand. A little broth improves the 
sauce. 



120 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Steamed Eggs. — Butter a tin plate and break in your eggs ; 
set in a steamer ; place, over a kettle of boiling water, and 
steam until the whites are cooked; they are more orna- 
mental when broken into patty tins, as they keep their form 
better ; the whites of the eggs, when cooked in thisi manner, 
are tender and light, and not tough and leathery, as if cooked 
by any other process. 

Eggs in this style can be eaten by invalids, and are very 
much richer than by any other method. 

Whirled Eggs. — Put a quart of water, slightly salted, into 
a saucepan over the fire, and keep it at a fast boil. Stir 
with wooden spoon or ladle in one direction until it whirls 
rapidly. Break six eggs, one at a time, into a cup and drop 
each carefully into'the centre, or vortex, of the boiling water. 
If kept at a rapid motion, the egg will become a soft, round 
ball. Take it out carefully with a perforated spoon, and put 
it on a slice of buttered toast laid upon a hot dish. Put a 
bit of butter on the top. Set the dish in the oven to keep 
warm, and proceed in the same way with another &%%, hav- 
ing but one in the saucepan at a time. When all are done, 
dust lightly with salt and pepper and send up hot. 

Eggs a la Mode. — Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, 
medium size, cut them up in a saucepan, add a little butter, 
pepper, and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or 
six eggs, and just before you serve, turn them into a sauce- 
pan with the tomato, and stir one way for two minutes, allow- 
ing them time to be well done. 

Baked Eggs. — Mix finely chopped ham and bread-crumbs 
in about equal proportions, season with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with milk and a little melted butter; half fill your 
small patty pans with the mixture, break an g^^ over the 
top of each, sprinkle with fine bread-crumbs, and bake; 
serve liot. 



EGGS. 



121 



Baked Eggs, No. 2.— Butter a clean, smooth saucepan, break 
as many eggs as will be needed into a saucer, one by one, 
and if found good, slip each into the saucepan. No broken 
yelk must be allowed, nor must they crowd so as to risk 
breaking the yelk after put in. Put a small piece of butter 
on each, and sprmkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well- 
heated oven, and bake till the whites are set. If the oven 
is rightly heated, it will take but a few minutes, and the 
cooking will be far more delicate than fried eggs. 

Eggs sur le Plat— Melt butter on a stone-china or tin plate. 
Break the eggs carefully into this ; dust lightly with pepper 
and salt, and put on top of the stove until the whites are 
well set. Sei-ve in the dish in which they are baked. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Put into a frying-pan enough butter to 
grease it well ; slip in the eggs carefully without breaking 
the yelks ; add butter, and season to taste ; when the whites 
begin to set, stir the eggs from the bottom of the pan, and 
continue stirring until the cooking is completed. The 
appearance at the end should, be marbled, rather than mixed. 

Scrambled i^gs with Ham, — Put into a pan, butter, a little 
pepper and salt, and a little milk ; when hot, drop in the 
eggs, and with a knife cut the eggs and scrape them from 
the bottom as the whites begin to set ; add some cold ham 
chopped fine, and when done, serve in a hot dish. 

Toasted Eggs. — Cover the bottom of an earthenware or 
stone-china dish with rounds of delicately toasted bread, or 
with rounds of stale bread dipped in beaten egg and fried 
quickly to a golden-brown in butter or nice dripping. 
Break an egg carefully upon each, and set the dish imme- 
diately in front of a glowing fire. Toast over this as many 
slices o{ fat salt pork or ham as there are eggs in the dish, 
holding the meat so that it will fry very quickly and all the 
drippmg fall upon the eggs. When these are well set, they 
are done. Turn the dish several times while toasting the 



122 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

meat, that the eggs may be equally cooked. Do not send 
the pork to table, but pepper the eggs lightly and remove 
with the toast to the dish in which they go to the table. 

Egg Toast. — Beat four eggs, yelks and whites, together 
thoroughly ; put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a sauce- 
pan and melt slowly ; then pour in the eggs and h^at, with- 
out boiling, over a slow fire, stirring constantly ; add a little 
salt, and when hot spread on slices of nicely browned toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Baskets. — Boil quite hard as many eggs as will be 
needed. Put into cold water till cold, then cut neatly into 
halves with a thin, sharp knife ; remove the yelk and rub to 
a paste with some melted butter, adding pepper and salt. 
Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is ready. 
Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey, which may be on 
hand, chop fine and pound smooth, and while pounding 
mix in the paste prepared from the yelks. As you pound, 
moisten with melted butter and some gravy which may 
have been left over from the fowls ; set this paste when done 
over hot water till well heated. Cut off a small slice from 
the end of the empty halves of the whites, so they will stand 
firm, then fill them with this paste ; place them close to- 
gether on a flat, round dish, and pour over the rest of the 
gravy, if any remains, or make a little fresh. A few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

Fricasseed Eggs.— Boil six eggs hard ; when cold, slice 
with a sharp knife. Have ready some slices of stale bread, 
fried to a nice brown in butter or drippings. Put a cupful 
of good broth in drawn butter over the fire, season it with 
pepper, salt, and a trace of onion; let it come to a boil. 
Dip the slices of egg first into raw ^g-g, then into cracker 
dust or bread-crumbs, and lay them gently into the gravy 
upon the side of the range. Do not let it actually boil, lest 
the eggs should break, but let them lie thus in the cfravy at 



EGGS. 123 

least five minutes. Place the fried bread upon a platter, lay 
the sliced eggs evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, 
and serve hot. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, 
and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together 
from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to 
four dessertspoonfuls of currie-powder ; shake them in a 
stewpan, or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire 
for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions 
finely minced, and fry gently until they are soft; pour in by 
degrees from half to three-quarters of a pint of broth or 
gravy, and stew slowly until they are reduced to pulp ; mix 
smoothly a small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonfuls 
of wheaten or rice flour ; stir them to the currie, and simmer 
the whole until the raw taste of the thickening is gone. 
Cut the eggs into half-inch slices, heat them through in the 
sauce without boiling them, £md send to the table as hot as 
possible. 

Plain Omelet — Beat thoroughly yelks of five eggs, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour, rubbed smooth in two-thirds of a 
cupful of milk. Salt and pepper to taste, and add a piece 
of butter the size of a hickory-nut. Beat the whites to a 
stiff" froth, pour the mixture into the whites, and without 
stirring pour into a hot, buttered omelet pan. Cook on top 
of the range for five minutes ; then set pan and all into the 
oven to brown the top nicely. 

Baked Omelet — Beat the yelks of six eggs, and add the 
whites of three eggs beaten very light ; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a tablespoonful of flour mixed in a cup of milk. 
Pour into a well-buttered pan and put into a hot oven ; 
when thick, pour over it the whites of three eggs beaten 
light ; then brown nicely, without allowing the top to be- 
come crusted. Serve immediately. 



124 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



Omelet a la Mode. — Beat the yelks and whites of six eggs 
separately until light, then beat together and add one table- 
spoonful of cream. Have in the omelet pan a piece of 
butter ; when the butter is boiling hot, pour in the omelet 
and shake until it begins to stiffen, and then let it brown, and 
season to taste. Fold double and serve hot. 

If a larger omelet is desired, a tablespoonful of milk to 
each egg may be added, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch 
or flour to the whole. 

Cheese Omelet. — Butter the sides of a deep dish and cover 
with thin slices of rich cheese ; lay over the cheese thin 
slices of well-buttered bread, first covering the cheese with 
a little red pepper and mustard ; then another layer of cheese ; 
beat the yelk of an e.g^ in a cup of cream or milk, and pour 
over the dish, and put at once into the oven ; bake till nicely 
browned. Serve hot, or it will be tough and hard, but when 
properly cooked it will be tender and savory. 

Meat or Pish Omelet. — Make the same as plain omelet. When 
it is done, scatter thickly over the surface cold, boiled ham, 
tongue, poultry, fish, or lobster, chopped fine, and season 
nicely to taste ; slip the broad knife under one side of the 
omelet and double, inclosing the meat. Then upset the 
frying-pan upon a hot dish, so transferring the omelet with- 
out breaking. Or the minced meat may be stirred in after 
the ingredients are put together, and before cooking. Be 
careful not to scorch the egg. 

Omelet with Oysters. — Allow one egg for each person, 
and beat yelks and whites separately, very light ; season 
to taste, and just before cooking add the oysters, which have 
been previously scalded in their own liquor. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some fresh eggs, and, when 
cold, cut them into moderately thin slices, and lay them be- 
tween slices of bread and butter cut thin, and season well 



EGGS. 125 

with celery salt. For picnic parties or for traveling, these 
SEindwiches are very nice. 

Deviled Eggs.— Boil the eggs hard, remove the shell, and 
cut in two as preferred. Remove the yelks, and add to them 
salt, cayenne pepper, melted butter, and mixed mustard to 
taste ; then stuff the cavities of the hard whites, and put the 
halves together again. Serve garnished with parsley. For 
picnics, etc., each egg can be wrapped in tissue paper to 
preserve its form. 

Pickled Eggs. — Boil the eggs until very hard ; when cold, 
shell them, and cut them in halves lengthways. Lay them 
carefully in large-mouthed jars, and pour over them scalding 
vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper, allspice, a few 
pieces of ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, tie 
up closely, and let them stand a month. They are then fit 
for use. With cold meat, they are a most delicious and 
delicate pickle. 

Egg Balls. — Rub the yelks of hard-boiled eggs with the 
raw yelk of an egg, well beaten, and season to taste. Roll 
this paste into balls the size of marbles, adding flour if neces- 
sary to thicken, and boil two minutes. A valuable embel- 
lishment and enrichment of soups. 



X.— BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 

AN immense department is opened up by the title of this 
chapter; and it is a department of immense im- 
portance. Bread is confessedly the " staff of life," 
and, therefore, it should be good. And whatever takes the 
place of bread, be it biscuits, hot cakes, muffins, or what 
not, should also be good, or nothing is gained by the 
exchange. Many a housekeeper can make excellent pies, 
cakes, etc., but when bread is needed, she flies to the bakery, 
confessing her total inability to prepare this indispensable 
commodity. 

But even bread may become distasteful as a steady diet. 
To vary it with the long line of splendid substitutes which 
are possible, and which are discussed in this chapter, is a 
most desirable ability. This department, therefore, is worthy 
of every housewife's devout study.

ESSENTIALS TO MAKING GOOD BREAD ; HOW TO KNOW GOOD FLOUR ; 
YEAST ; RAISING BREAD J BAKING BREAD. TWELVE RECIPES FOR 
BREAD. 

THREE things are essential to the making of good bread, 
namely, good flour, good yeast, and judicious baking. 
A fourth might be added, experience, without which 
none of the domestic arts can be successfully carried on. 

In selecting flour, first look to the color. If it is white, 
with a yellowish straw-coJor tint, buy it. If it is white, with 
a bluish cast, or with black specks in it, refuse it. Next, 
examine its adhesiveness ; wet and knead a little of it be- 

126 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 127 

tween your fingers ; if it works soft and sticky, it is poor. 
Then throw a Httle lump of dried flour against a smooth 
surface ; if it falls like powder, it is bad. Lastly, squeeze 
some of the flour tightly in your hand j if it retains the 
shape given by the pressure, that too is a good sign. It is 
safe to buy flour that will stand all these tests. 

Good yeast may easily be obtained in cities, in the form 
of fresh yeast cakes or at the baker shops. Where access 
cannot be had to these aids, home-made yeast must be 
depended on, which see under " Yeast," at the end of this 
chapter. After the yeast is properly added, the dough must 
stand several hours in an even temperature of moderate 
warmth, so that the process of " rising " may go on. This 
is simply a fermenting, or leavening, or lightening of the 
dough. If this process, by too much heat or other causes, 
goes too fast or too far, sour bread is the result ; if it goes 
too slow, or not far enough, heavy bread is the result. It 
must go just far enough, and just at the right moment the 
process must be arrested by baking. The walls of dough 
which inclose the innumerable vesicles of gas formed in the 
fermenting are thus made firm around those open spaces, 
and what we know as " light bread " is secured. 

The baking is the final test in the case. The oven must 
be just right at the outset, and must be kept so as the 
operation proceeds. Experience must decide the exact heat 
required, but an oven in which the bared arm may be held 
for about half a minute is regarded as approximately 
correct. 

Hot bread, or hot cake, should always be cut with a hot 
knife. If so cut, it will not become clammy. 

RECIPES. 

Wheat Bread. — Put seven pounds* of flour into a breadpan ; 
hollow out the centre, and add a quart of lukewarm water, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a wineglassful of yeast. Have 



128 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ready more warm water, and add gradually as much as will 
make a smooth, soft dough. Knead it well, dust a little 
flour over it, cover it with a cloth, and set it in a warm place 
four hours ; then knead it again for fifteen minutes and let 
it rise again. Divide it into loaves, and prick them with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven from forty minutes to an 
hour. 

Potato Bread. — Three and one-half quarts of sifted flour, 
three boiled potatoes, one quart warm water, one teacupful 
of yeast, one even tablespoonful salt. Mix at night ; put 
the flour in a large bowl ; hollow a place in the centre for 
the mashed potatoes, water, and salt. Stir in flour enough 
to make a smooth batter ; add yeast ; stir in the rest of the 
flour. Put the dough on the floured board ; knead fifteen 
minutes, using barely enough flour to prevent sticking. 
Flour the bowl, lay the dough in it, cover and leave it to 
rise. In the morning, divide in four parts ; mold into loaves; 
when light, prick, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Salt Rising Bread. — Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart 
pail or pitcher on one-half tablespoonful of salt ; when it 
has cooled a little, add one and one-third pints of flour ; 
mix well, and leave the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm 
as that used for mixing. Keep it at the same temperature 
until the batter is nearly twice its original bulk, which will 
be in from five to eight hours. It may be stirred once or 
twice during the rising. Add to this a sponge made of one 
quart of hot water, two and one-half quarts of flour — adding 
as much more as may be necessary to make a soft dough ; 
mix well, and leave in a warm place to rise. When light, 
mold into loaves, keeping them as soft as possible ; lay in 
buttered tins. When light again, prick and bake. 

Milk Bread. — Let two quarts of milk come to a boil ; stand 
it aside to cool, and when it becomes tepid, ,add flour to it 
gradually until it makes a batter just soft enough to beat up 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 129 

with a spoon. To this add one cake of compressed yeast 
thoroughly dissolved in lukewarm water. The batter should 
then be well beaten. Cover with a towel and set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, add two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
one of lard, one of light brown sugar, and flour enough to 
make a soft dough. Knead steadily for about half an hour. 
This quantity should make four or five medium-sized loaves. 
Put them in greased pans and let them rise again. When 
.light, prick with a fork and bake in a quick oven. 

Vienna Bread. — The Vienna bread that became so famous 
on the Centennial Exhibition grounds in 1876 was made on 
the following recipe : Sift in a tin pan four pounds of flour ; 
bank up against the sides ; pour in one quart of milk and 
water, and mix into it enough flour to form a thin batter, 
and then quickly and lightly add one pint of milk, in which 
is dissolved one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter 
ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour against 
the sides of the pan ; cover the pan with a cloth, and set in 
a place free from draught for three quarters of an hour ; 
then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough will leave 
the bottom and sides of the pan, and let it stand two and a 
half hours ; finally, divide the mass into one-pound pieces, 
to be cut in turn into twelve parts each ; this gives square 
pieces about three and a half inches thick, each corner of 
which is taken up and folded over to the centre, and then 
the cases are turned over on a dough-board to rise for half 
an hour, when they are put in a hot oven that will bake 
them in ten minutes. 

Rye Bread. — Scald two handfuls of corn-meal with a quart 
of boiling water, and add a quart of milk and a tablespoonful 
of salt. When cool, add a teacupful of yeast, and enough 
rye flour to make it as stiff as wheat-bread dough. After 
it has risen put it in pans and bake an hour and a half. 

Brown Bread, — Take one cup 01 bread-crumbs, one pint &f

II.— TOAST. 
WHAT TOAST IS GOOD FOR. SIX METHODS OF PREPARING TOAST. 

AS a palatable method of disposing of stale bread, as well 
as to furnish a variety of agreeable dishes, toast is an 
important factor in the culinary economy of the home. 
As a dish for invalids it is indispensible. 

RECIPES. 

Dry Toast is produced by browning stale baker's bread 
over glowing coals. A toasting fork, or rack, of which 
there are various patterns, is a great convenience. Do not 
burn the toast, nor allow it to be so browned as to harden it. 
It should be eaten hot, as it becomes tough when allowed 
to cool. 

Buttered Toast. — For buttered toast, the slices should be 
thicker than for dry toast. Butter the slices as toasted, and 
keep warm until served. Excessive buttering should be 
avoided. 

Egg Toast — On slices of buttered toast lay poached eggs. 
Serve with Worcestershire sauce for breakfast. 

French Toast, — Beat three eggs light, add one cupful of 
milk, with pepper and salt to taste. Dip into this slices of 
bread, then fry them in hot butter to a delicate brown. 

Milk Toast. — Toast the bread an even, delicate brown, and 
pile into a hot dish. Boil milk with a little salt, a teaspoon- 
ful of flour, and one of butter, rubbed together; pour it over 
the toast and serve hot. 

Cream Toast. — Take slices of baker's bread from which 
the crust has been pared and toast it to a golden brown. 
Have on the range a shallow bowl or pudding-dish, more 
than half full of boiling water, in which a tablespoonful of 
butter has been melted. As each slice is toasted, dip in this 



132 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

for a second, sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay in the deep 
heated dish in which it is to be served. Have ready, by the 
time all the bread is toasted, a quart of milk scalding hot, 
but not boiling. Thicken this with two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch or best flour ; let it simmer until cooked ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, and when this is melted, the 
beaten whites of three eggs. Boil up once, and pour over 
the toast, lifting the lower slices one by one, that the creamy 
mixture may run in between them. Cover closely, and 
set in the oven two or thi^ee minutes before serving.

FANCY BREADS AND PLAIN CAKES ; THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
EIGHT RECIPES FOR FANCY BREADS. 

SOME Special preparations come naturally between bread 
and cake. For convenient classification, they are 
grouped here under the title of Fancy Breads, though 
they might as well be classed as Plain Cakes. They serve 
a good purpose for variety, for luncheon, etc. See plainer 
forms of cakes. 

RECIPES. 

Sally Limn. — One quart of flour, a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, two tea- 
cupfuls of milk, two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar, one of 
soda, and a little salt. Scatter the cream of tartar, the sugar, 
and the salt into the flour ; add the eggs, the butter (melted), 
and one cup of milk ; dissolve the soda in the remaining cup, 
and stir all together steadily a few moments. Bake in two 
round pans. 

Sally Liiim, No. 2. — Rub into a quart of flour two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder ; beat together nearly half a cup of 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. I33 

butter and two tablespoonfuls of sugar ; put into the flour 
and mix with a pint of milk ; then add two eggs, beaten 
hght. Mix and bake as above. 

Johimy Cake. — One quart of buttermilk or sour milk, one 
quart Indian meal, one quart of flour, one cup of molasses, 
a teaspoonful of soda, two scant teaspoonfuls if the milk is

oven. 

Hoe Cake. — Scald one quart of Indian-meal in enough water 
to make a thick batter ; add a teaspoonful of salt, one of 
molasses, and two, of butter. Bake on a board before a hot 
fire or in a pan. 

Scotch Short-cake. — Two pounds of fine flour, one pound 
of fresh, sweet butter, half a pound of finest sifted sugar ; 
throughly knead together without water; roll out to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it on paper in a shallow 
pan ; bake very slowly until of proper crispness. The cake, 
to be good, must be very brittle. 

Pumpkia Bread. — Stew and strain a sufficient quantity of 
pumpkin ; add enough Indian-meal to stiffen it, with yeast 
and a little salt ; when sufficiently raised, bake as in ordi- 
nary bread. 

Pone. — This is a dish prepared by the Indians, called also 
paune. Take two cupfuls of corn-meal, two of wheat flour, 
one of sugar, and half a cup of melted butter. Add one 
egg, one teaspoonful of salt, one of soda, and two of cream 
of tartar. Mix with enough milk to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in a hot oven. 

Barley Bread. — In Scotland, Norway, and other climates 
where wheat is not grown, barley bread is used extensively. 
It is both wholesome and palatable. Mix the barley meal 
with warm water and a little salt, but no yeast. Mix to a 
stiff dough, roll into flat cakes, and bake before the fire or 
in an oven. Eat hot, with butter.

IV.— ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE BREAKFAST DISH. SEVEN VARIETIES OF ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE departure from the ordinary forms of 
bread is furnished in rolls. They are exceedingly pop- 
ular for breakfast, served warm. There are sufficient 
variations in rolls to make them suitable for use day after 
day, if this be desired. 

RECIPES. 

Plain RoUs. — Boil six potatoes in two quarts of water, and 
when done pour and press the whole through the colander ; 
when cool, but not cold, add flour to make a thick batter ; 
add half a cup of yeast, or one-half cake of compressed yeast, 
and set to rise ; when light, add half a cup of lard and but- 
ter mixed, a tablespoonful of sugar, teaspoonful of salt, and 
flour to make a soft dough ; knead well and set again to 
rise ; when light, knead down again ; repeat three or four 
times ; an hour before they are to be used cut in small 
pieces, roll out, spread with melted butter, and fold over, 
laying them in a pan so that they will not touch each other ; 
set them in a warm place, and when light bake quickly. Or, 
make into an oblong roll without spreading and rolling, and 
just before putting them into the oven, gash deeply across 
the top with a sharp knife. 

Englisli Rolls. — Two pounds of flour, two ounces of butter, 
three tablespoonfuls of yeast, one pint of warm milk ; mix 
well together, and set in a warm place to rise ; knead, and 
make into rolls ; let them rise again and bake twenty min- 
utes. 

Breakfast Rolls. — One quart of sifted flour, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking-powder, half teaspoonful salt; mix well together 
dry, then add three and half gills of cold milk, or enough 
to make it the consistency of batter, and drop with a spoon 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 135 

into gem baking-pans, which should have been previously 
heated very hot and buttered. 

Frencll Rolls. — One pint of milk, scalded ; put into it while 
hot half a cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter ; 
when the milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cupful of 
yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast ; stir in flour enough 
to make a stiff sponge, and when light mix as for bread. 
Let it rise until light, punch it down with the hand, and let 
it rise again, and repeat this process two or three times ; 
then turn the dough on to the molding board, and pound 
with rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out with a 
tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted butter, 
and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins ; bake, and 
while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to 
make the crust tender. 

Vienna Rolls. — One quart sifted flour, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of a good baking-powder ; mix well while dry ; then 
add a tablespoonful of butter or lard, made a little soft by 
warming and stirring, and about three-fourths of a pint, or 
enough cold, sweet milk for a dough of usual stiffness, with 
about half a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Mix into a 
dough easily to be handled without sticking ; turn on the 
board and roll out to the thickness of half an inch, cut it 
out with a large cake-cutter, spread very lightly with butter, 
fold one-half over the other, and lay them in a greased pan 
without touching. Wash them over with a little milk, and 
bake in a hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls. — One teacupful of yeast, or one cake 
of compressed yeast, a little salt, one tablespoonful sugar, 
piece of lard size of an egg, one pint milk, flour sufficient to 
mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the lard in it. 
Prepare the flour with salt, sugar, and yeast. Then add the 
milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly, and when mixed set 
to rise ; when light, knead again slightly. Then roll out

and cut with large biscuit-cutter. Spread a little butter on 
each roll and lap together. Let them rise again very light, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Geueva KoUs. — Into two pounds of flour break three 
ounces of butter, add a little salt, and make into a sponge 
with yeast, previously mixed with milk and water. Allow 
the batter to rise ; then mix in two eggs, made lukewarm 
by the adding of hot milk, and work the sponge to a light 
dough. Let it stand for three-quarters of an hour longer ; 
mold into small rolls ; place them in buttered pans. When 
light, brush them with beaten yelks of eggs,^and bake for 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve hot.

SPECIAL CARE REQUISITE IN THIS DEPARTMENT ; ATTENTION TO 
INGREDIENTS, OVEN, ETC; HOW TO BAKE THEM J BAKING-POW- 
DER BISCUITS, SODA BISCUITS, ETC. j CARE OF PANS. FIFTEEN 
RECIPES FOR BISCUITS, BUNS, ETC. 

GREAT care is requisite in making biscuits that quantities 
be accurately observed and that the ingredients used 
are of proper quality. Flour should be a few months 
old. New flour will not make good biscuits. It should 
always be sifted. 

The oven, too, needs careful attention. On its condition 
the success of biscuit baking will depend. Rolls and bis- 
cuit should bake quickly. To make them a nice color, rub 
them over with warm water just before putting them into 
the oven ; to glaze them, brush lightly with milk arid sugar. 
Baking-powder biscuit and soda biscuit should be made 
as rapidly as possible, laid into hot pans, and put in a 
quick oven. Gem pans should always be hsated and well 
greased. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 137 

RECIPES. 

Potato Biscuit. — Pare ten potatoes, boil them thoroughly, 
and mash fine ; add two cups of lukewarm milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, half a cup of yeast, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Mix well and allow it to 
rise. Then add four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a little 
salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let this rise 
again ; roll into a sheet about an inch thick, and cut into 
cakes. Set to rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 

Light Biscuit — When kneading bread, set aside a small 
loaf for biscuits. Into this, work a heaping tablespoonful of 
lard and butter mixed and a teaspoonful of sugar. The 
more it is worked the whiter it will be. As it rises, 
mold it down twice before making into biscuit. Roll out 
and cut with a biscuit-cutter. The dough should be quite 
soft. 

Soda BiscTiits. — One quart of flour, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and two of lard, a teaspoonful of salt, and one teaspoon 
even full of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of soda ; sift 
the cream tartar with the flour dry ; rub the butter and lard 
very thoroughly through it ; dissolve the soda in a pint of 
milk and mix all together. Roll out, adding as little flour 
as possible; cut with a biscuit-cutter, and bake twenty 
minutes in a quick oven. 

Tea Biscuit. — Take one quart sifted flour, one tablespoon- 
ful shortening, half teaspoonful salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
Durkee's baking-powder ; mix well together dry, then add 
sufficient cold milk or water to form a very soft dough ; 
bake immediately in a quick oven. 

Cream Biscuits. — Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a 
quart of sour cream, add to it flour sufficient to make a soft 
dough and a little salt ; or use sour milk, and rub a table^ 
spoonful of butter into the flour.

tween the palms, and let the biscuits rise twenty minutes, 
then bake in a tolerably hot oven. 

Maryland Biscuits. — Take three pints of sifted flour, one 
tablespoonful of good lard, one pint of cold water, salt to 
the taste; make into a stiff dough ; work it till it cracks or 
blisters, then break, but do not cut it, into suitable portions, 
and make into biscuits ; stick the top of each with a fork 
and bake. 

Yorkshire Biscuits. — Make a batter with flour sufficient and 
one quart of boiling hot milk. When the batter has cooled 
to lukewarmness, add a teacupful of yeast and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Set to rise again and let it become very 
light ; then stir in a half teaspoonful of soda, two eggs, and 
a tablespoonful of melted butter. Add flour enough to 
make the dough into small, round cakes ; let them rise fifteen 
minutes, and bake in a slow oven.

Let them rise, and bake in a moderate oven. Glaze while 
hot with white of egg, in which has been stirred, not beaten, 
a little powdered sugar, or sift the powdered sugar in while 
the &^'g is still moist on the top. Rusks should never be 
eaten hot. 

Sweet Riisk. — One pint of warm milk — new is best — one- 
half cup of butter, one cup of sugar, two eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of yeast ; make a sponge 
with the milk, yeast, and enough flour to make a thin bat- 
ter, and let it rise over night. In the morning add the

When they have stood half an hour, make a cross upon 
each with a knife, and put instantly into the oven. Bake to 
a light brown, and brush over with a feather or soft bit of 
rag, dipped in the white of an egg beaten up stiff with white 
sugar. 



140 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Pop Overs. — Mix four cupfuls of flour, four cupfuls of 
milk, four eggs, and a little salt. This quantity will make' 
about twenty puffs in gem-pans, which must be baked quick 
and done to a nice brown. 



VI.— MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

HOW MUFFINS AND WAFFLES DIFFER ; THEIR RELATION TO OTHER 
KINDRED PREPARATIONS ; MUFFIN-RINGS AND WAFFLE-IRONS ; 
WHEN TO USE MUFFINS AND WAFFLES j HOW TO SERVE THEM. 
ELEVEN RECIPES FOR MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

MUFFINS are baked in rings on a griddle, or in gem- 
pans, over a quick fire. Waffles are baked in waffle- 
irons, which inclose the batter and imprint both sides 
of the cake as it rises in the process of baking. Both muf- 
fins and waffles form a medium between bread and biscuits 
on the one side and griddle-cakes on the other. Mufifin- 
rings were formerly about four inches in diameter, but now, 
with better taste, they are used much smaller. The approved 
wafHe-irons of to-day are circular, baking four waffles at 
once, and suspended on a pivot that permits them to be 
turned with a touch of the fork. Both muffins and wafHes 
are suitable for tea, and with stewed chicken and such deli- 
cacies they are really delicious. They should always be 
served hot and with the best of butter. Waffles and catfish 
are a famous dish at some eating-houses. 

RECIPES. 

Mnfflns. — Two eggs lightly beaten, one quart of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of Durkee's baking- 
powder, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one pint of 
milk, and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, if liked. 
Beat up quickly to the consistency of a cake batter; bake in 
buttered gem-pans in a hot oven. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. \^\ 

MufSus, No. 2. — One cup of home-made yeast or half of a 
compressed yeast cake, one pint of sweet milk, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Beat the butter, sugar, and eggs well together ; then 
stir in the milk, slightly warmed, and thicken with flour to 
the consistency of griddle-cakes. When light, bake in muffin- 
rings or on a griddle. If wanted for tea, the batter should 
be mixed immediately after breakfast. Muffins should never 
be cut with a knife, but be pulled open with the fingers. 

Rice Mufians. — Take one quart of sour milk, three well- 
beaten eggs, a little salt, a teaspoonful of soda, and enough 
of rice flour to thicken to a stiff" batter. Bake in rings. 

Hominy Muffins. — Substitute hominy, well cooked and 
mashed, for the rice, and proceed as above. 

Bread Muffins. — Cut the crust off" four thick slices of bread ; 
put them in a pan and pour on them just enough boiling 
water to soak them thoroughly. Let them stand an hour, 
covered ; then drain off" the water and stir the bread to a 
smooth paste. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, a half 
pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. Bake to a delicate 
brown in well-buttered muffin-rings. 

Graham Muffins. — One quart of Graham flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, one egg, one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, milk enough to make a batter as thick as 
for griddle-cakes. Bake in gem-pans or muffin-rings in a 
hot oven. 

Com Muffins. — Mix two cupfuls of corn-meal, two cupfuls 
of flour, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of melted butter,

VIII.— YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

NATURE OF YEAST ; ACTION OF YEAST IN DOUOH J CAUSES OF LJGHT 
BREAD AND HEAVY BREAD ; CARE OF YEAST. SIX RECIPES FOR 
YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

IN this chapter, yeast has been so often referred to that its 
special consideration seems important just here. An- 
alytically considered, it consists of an innumerable 
quantity of infinitesimal fungi, called the yeast-plant. The 
remarkable characteristic of these minute plants is, that 
under fayoring conditions they multiply to an incredible 



146 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

extent in a very short time. Thus the production of yeast, 
in proper mixtures, is an easy matter. 

When yeast is placed in doUgh, it immediately produces 
fermentation, in the process of which gases are generated, 
which permeate the dough, filling it with gas-vessels and so 
producing the spongy appearance so familiar in raised 
bread. If this process goes too far, it sours the dough and 
unfits it for food. If arrested by placing the dough in a 
hot oven, the gases will be driven off by the heat, and the 
thin dough walls will be set and baked. If the oven be 
slow, the gases will be driven off, the dough walls will col- 
lapse, and heavy bread will be the result. The proper use 
of yeast is most important, therefore. It must be watched 
as carefully as any other tender plant. Excessive heat or 
cold, or rough mechanical usage will quickly destroy it. 

RECIPES. 

Brewer's Yeast. — This yeast is produced during the process 
of fermenting malt liquors. It is the most effective yeast 
in use, being about eight times the strength of any other 
kind. 

Hop Teast. — Boil four pounds of pared potatoes in three 
quarts of water and stir through a colander. Boil a hand- 
ful of hops in one quart of water for ten minutes, and strain 
this upon the potatoes. Add a half pint of salt, a half pint of 
sugar, and a tablespoonful of ginger. The quantity should 
now measure five quarts. If it be less, add enough tepid 
water to make the quantity correct. When lukewarm, add 
a half pint of home-brewed yeast, mix thoroughly, and 
stand in a warm place till bubbles form on the surface, which 
indicate that it has become light. Cover the vessel contain- 
ing the yeast, and allow it to stand in a dry, cool place. It 
will keep well for months. A gill of this yeast will suffice 
for an ordinary baking, requiring a quart of water or milk. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. \\^ 

Patent Yeast. — Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of 
water for a half hour. Strain and cool till lukewarm, then 
add a handful of salt, a half pound of sugar, and a pound 
of flour, all mixed well and beaten up together. After it 
has stood forty-eight hours, add three pounds of potatoes, 
boiled and well-mashed. Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often ; then strain and bottle. It is ready for im- 
mediate use, or will keep several months. Keep in a cool 
place. 

Potato Yeast. — Pare and boil six potatoes; mash them 
through a colander and mix with them six tablespoonfuls of 
flour. Pour on a quart of boiling water from that in which 
the potatoes were boiled. Add half a teacupful of sugar, a 
tablespoonful of salt, and when cool, a teacupful of home- 
made yeast, or one-fourth the quantity of brewer's yeast. 

Yeast Cakes. — Thicken good yeast with Indian-meal till it 
becomes a stiff batter. A little rye will make it adhere bet- 
ter. Make into cakes an inch thick and two by three inches 
in area. Dry them in the air, but not in the sun. Keep 
them in a bag in a cool, dry place. One of these cakes is 
enough for four quarts of flour. To use them, soak in

care in ingredients and manipulation essential ; keep in- 
gredients cool ; mix quickly ; how to shorten ; how to 
roll; the filling; the baking, seventy-nine recipes 
for pastry and puddings. 

THAT pastry may be wholesome and appetizing, great 
care in the selection of ingredients and in their ma- 
nipulation is absolutely essential. One fact must 
always be borne in mind — that inferior ingredients cannot be 
made into superior compounds — though the finest ingre- 
dients may be ruined by careless or unskillful handling. 
Some suggestions of general application are therefore de- 
sirable. 

Be careful to have all the materials cool, and the? butter and 
lard hard ; use cold water (ice -water if convenient) ; use a 
cool knife, and work on a marble slab if it can be had. 

Put the ingredients together quickly, handling as little as 
possible ; slow mixing and much contact with the hands 
or fingers make tough crust. Always use well-sifted flour. 

Except in puff-paste, lard and butter in about equal pro- 
portions make the best crust ; if made of butter alone, it is 
almost sure to be tough. That of lard alone, though ten- 
der, is usually white and insipid. Beef drippings, or the 
drippings of fresh pork, make a very light and palatable 
crust, lighter and more tender indeed than that made with 
butter alone, much better tasted than that made with lard 
alone, and quite equal to that made with butter and lard 
combined. Never use mutton drippings in crust. 

Use very little salt and very little water ; pour the latter 
in gradually, only a few drops at a time, unless you want 
\ough crust.

PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 149 

Use plenty of flour on your paste-board, to keep the paste 
from sticking. Work the crust of one pie at a time, and 
always roll from you — one way only. 

The filling for the pie should be perfectly cool when put 
in, or it will make the bottom crust heavy. 

In making juicy pies, cut a slit in the top to let the steam 
escape, else the pie will be puffed unduly. 

The oven should be hot, but not sufficiently so to scorch • 
or to set the paste before it has had time to rise ; if too 
slack, the paste will not rise at all, but will be white and 
clammy. The best paste has a tinge of yellow. If per- 
mitted to scorch or brown, even the best paste becomes 
rancid. 

RECIPES. 

Pie Crust. — Take one-half cupful of lard, one-half cupful 
of butter, one quart of sifted flour, one cupful of cold water 
and a little salt. Rub the butter and lard slightly into the 
flour ; wet it with the water, mixing it as little as possible. 
This quantity will make two large or three small pies. 

Pie Crust Glaze. — To prevent juice from soaking the under 
crust, beat up the white of an egg, and before filling the pie, 
brush over the crust with the beaten egg. Brush over the 
top crust also, to give it a beautiful yellow brown. 

Puff Pasta — Take one pound of sifted flour, on which 
sprinkle a very little sugar ; take the yelks of one or two 
eggs, and beat into them a little ice-water, and pour gently 
into the centre of the flour, and work into a firm paste, 
adding water as is necessary ; divide three-quarters of a 
pound or a pound of firm, solid butter, as you prefer, into 
three parts ; roll out the paste, and spread one part of the 
butter on half of the paste ; fold the other half over, and 
roll out again, repeating the process until the butter is all 
rolled in ; then set the paste on the ice for fifteen or twenty 



150 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRA.R Y. 

minutes, after which roll out again three times, each time 
rolling it the opposite direction ; then put on the ice again 
until cold, when it is ready for use. Such paste will keep 
several days in a refrigerator, but should not be allowed to 
freeze. 

Paste Shells. — Take sufficient rich puff-paste prepared as 
in the preceding recipe, roll, very thin, cut to shape, and bake 
in a brisk oven in tin pans. Baked carefully, before fill- 
ing with fruit, the paste rises better. When cool, the shells 
may be filled with stewed fruit, jelly, preserves, rich cream 
whipped to a stiff froth, raspberries, strawberries, or sliced 
peaches. These are delicious light desserts. Raspberries, 
strawberries, or sliced peaches, smothered with whipped 
cream on these shells, are really exquisite. 

Apple Pie. — Line a pie plate with paste, and fill it heaping 
full with tart apples, sliced very thin. Sweeten and spice to 
taste, mixing well into the apples. Put in plenty of butter, 
and moisten well with cream. Bake until the apples are 
thoroughly done. Use no upper crust. 

Apple Meringue Pie. — Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples. 
Mash smooth, and season with nutmeg. Fill the crust, and 
bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick me- 
ringue, made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs lor each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered sugar for each egg. Flavor this with vanilla ; beat 
until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters of 
an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the meringue is 
well set. Eat cold. 

Peach Meringue Pie. — Proceed as above in all respects, 
simply substituting peaches for apples. Whipped cream 
will make a delightful substitute for the whipped egg in 
either of these meringue pies. 

Peach Pie. — Bake rich shells about two-thirds done ; if 
your peaches are fully ripe, cut them into halves or quarters, 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. J51 

put m the shell, sweeten and flavor to taste, cover or not as 
you choose, and finish baking in a quick oven ; if the 
peaches are ripe, but not soft, it will improve the flavor to 
sugar them down some hours before you wish to use them ; 
if not ripe, they should be stewed. 

Gooseberry Pie. — Stew the gooseberries with plenty of 
white sugar, and use plain puff-paste for crust. 

Cherry Pie. — Having removed the stones, put in sugar as 
may be needed, and stew the cherries slowly till they are 
quite done, if you use shells, or till nearly done if you use 
paste. A few of the pits added in stewing increase the 
richness of the flavor ; but they should not go into the pies. 
If baked slowly the cherries need 'not be stewed at all. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them 
in small pieces ; pour boiling water over and let stand for 
ten minutes ; drain thoroughly ; then fill the pie-dish evenly 
full ; put in plenty of sugar, a little butter, and dredge a 
trifle of flour evenly over the top ; cover with a thin crust, 
and bake the same as apple pie. Equal quantities of apple 
and rhubarb used in the same manner make a very good pie. 

PnmpMu Pie. — Stew the pumpkin until thoroughly done, 
and pass it through a colandee. To one quart of stewed 
pumpkin, add three eggs, and one pint of milk. Sweeten, 
and spice with ground ginger and cinnamon to taste. Add 
butter, rose water, and a little brandy. The quantity of 
milk used will vary as the pumpkin may be moist or dry. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Scrape clean two good-sized sweet pota- 
toes ; boil ; when tender, rub through the colander ; beat 
the yelks of three eggs light ; stir with a pint of sweet milk 
into the potato ; add a small teacupful of sugar, a pinch of 
.salt; flavor with a little fresh lemon, or lemon extract; 
bake to a nice brown ; when done, make a meringue top with 
the whites of eggs and powdered sugar ; brown this a 
moment in the oven.

^n a sieve, crush them slightly, and sweeten well. Spread 
plenty of berries over each layer of the crust, and have some 
of the crushed and sweetened berries in a deep dish. When

Paradise Pudding. — Stew until tender three ounces of rice 
in a pint and a quarter of milk, add four ounces of raisins, 
three ounces of suet chopped fine, two and a half ounces of 
sugar, two eggs, a little nutmeg and lemon peel. Boil three 
hours. Serve with hard sauce. 

JeUy Pudding. — Two cupfuls very fine stale biscuit or 
bread-crumbs ; one cupful of rich milk — half cream, if you 
can get it; five eggs, beaten very light; one-half teaspoon- 
ful of soda, stirred in boiling water ; one cupful of sweet 
j-lly, jam, or marmalade. .Scald the milk and pour over the 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. 163 

crumbs. Beat until half cold, and stir in the beaten yelks, 
then whites, finally the soda. Fill large cups half full with 
the batter ; set in a quick oven and bake half an hour. 
When done, turn out quickly and dexterously ; with a sharp 
knife make an incision in the side of each ; pull partly open, 
and put a liberal spoonful of the conserve within. Close the 
slit by pinching the edges with your fingers. Eat warm with 
sweetened cream. 

Cabinet Pudding. — Take of the remains of any kind of cake 
broken up two cupfuls, half a cupful of raisins, half a can of 
peaches, four eggs, one and a half pints of milk. Butter a 
plain pudding mold and lay in some of the broken cake, 
one-third of the raisins, stoned, one-third of the peaches ; 
make two layers of the remainder of the cake, raisins, and 
peaches. Cover with a very thin slice of bread, then pour 
over the milk beaten with the eggs and sugar. Set in a 
saucepan of boiling water to reach two-thirds up the side of 
the mold, and steam three-quarters of an hour. 

Turn out carefully on a dish, and serve with peach sauce, 
made as follows : Place the peach juice from the can into a 
small saucepan ; add an equal volume of water, a little more 
sugar, and eight or ten raisins ; boil ten minutes, strain, and 
just before serving add six drops of bitter almond. 

Delicions Pudding. — Bake a common sponge cake in a flat- 
bottomed pudding-dish ; when ready for use, cut in six or 
eight pieces ; split and spread with butter, and return them 
to the dish. Make a custard with four eggs to a quart of 
milk, flavor and sweeten to taste ; pour over the cake and 
bake one-half hour. The cake will swell and fill the custard. 
Any stale cake will do about as well as sponge cake. 

Bird's-nest Pudding. — Make the foundation of the nest of 
corn-starch or blanc-mange. Cut strips of lemon peel, boil 
in a sirup of water and sugar till tender, and arrange around 
the blanc-mange to represent straw. Extract the contents

of four eggs through a small hole, and fill the shells with 
hot blanc-mange or corn-starch. When cold, break off the 
shells, and lay the molded eggs in the nest. 

Snow Pudding. — Soak an ounce of gelatine in a pint of 
cold water for one hour; then place it over the fire, stir 
gently, and remove as soon as it is dissolved ; when almost 
cold, beat to a stiff froth with an egg-beater. Beat the 
whites of three eggs to a stiff froth, and add it to the 
gelatine froth, together with the juice of three lemons, and 
pulverized sugar to the taste. Mix the whole well together, 
pour into a mold, and set aside to cool. Serve on a dish 
with soft custard made from the yelks of the eggs. 

CheiTy Pudding. — Two eggs, one cupful sweet milk, flour 
enough to make a stiff batter, two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, and as many cherries as can be stirred in. Eat with 
sauce made of the cherries. 

Blackbeny MusL — Put the berries into a preserving kettle 
and mash with sugar enough to make sweet ; set over' the 
fire, and when it begins to simmer, stir in very gradually 
one tablespoonful, or more if needed, of corn-starch to a 
quart of fruit ; stir until well cooked, and eat either hot 
or cold with cream ; raspberries also may be used this way. 

Roley-poley, — Make a good biscuit dough, and roll about 
three-quarters of an inch thick, and spread with berries, 
preserves, or slices of apple ; roll up and tie in a cloth ; boil 
or steam an hour and a half. 

Berry or Fruit Puddings. — One quart sifted flour, two table- 
spoonfuls shortening, half teaspoonful salt, and two tea- 
spoonfuls baking-powder ; mix well, then form a soft dough 
of milk or water, roll out thin, and spread with any kind of 
berries, fruit, or preserves ; roll it up, tie in a cloth, and 
place in the steamer, or boil in a mold. This makes fine 
dumplings.

German Puffs. — Two cups of sweet milk, two cups of flour, 
three eggs, and a little salt. Bake in buttered cups. 

Indian Puffs. — Into one quart of boiling milk stir eight 
tablespoonfuls of corn-meal and four tablespoonfuls of 
brown sugar ; boil five minutes, stirring constantly ; when 
cool, add six well-beaten eggs • bake in buttered cups half 
an hour. Eat with sauce. 

WMte Puffs. — One pint rich milk ; whites of four eggs 
whipped stiff; one heaping cupful prepared flour ; one scant 
cupful powdered sugar ; grated peel of half a lemon ; a little 
salt. Whisk the eggs and sugar to a meringue, and add 
this alternately with the flour to the milk. Cream, or half 
cream half milk, is better. Beat until the mixture is very 
light, and bake in buttered cups or tins. Turn out, sift 
powdered sugar over them, and eat with lemon sauce. 

Oak Balls. — Three cupfuls each of flour and milk, three 
eggs, whites and yelks beaten separately and very light, 
three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a little salt. Pour in 
well-buttered muffin-rings, and bake to a nice brown. 

Apple Dumplings. — Make a biscuit dough, and cover the 
apples (pared and cored), singly ; tie in cloths and drop in 
boiling water. Let it boil half an hour. If preferred, mix 
flour and a little salt, and scald with boiling water. When 
cold enough to handle, roll it out and cover the apples. Or 
a pie-crust may be made for a cover and the dumplings may 
be baked in the oven. 

Peach Dumplings. — These may be made according to the 
preceding recipe, substituting peaches for apples. 

Lemon Dumplings. — Take suet, four ounces ; moist sugar, 
four ounces ; bread-crumbs, one-half pound ; one lemon. 
Grate the rind of the lemon, squeeze out the juice, mix all 
the ingredients. Put in buttered teacups and bake three- 
quarters of an hour.

RECIPES FOR CREAMS, JELLIES, BLANC-MANGES, ETC. 

THERE is a delightful range of light desserts which need 
to be introduced more generally into our homes. 
They have too long been allowed to rest in the con- 
fectioner's under the erroneous notion that they were be- 
yond the capacity of the ordinary housekeeper. 

Prominent among these desserts are ice-cream and water- 
ices with all their splendid possibilities of variety. For hints 
concerning freezers and other tools for the home manufac- 
ture of these preparations, see the last chapter of this 
department. 

In making ice-cream, use only the best materials. Avoid 
milk thickened with arrow-root, corn-starch, or any farina- 
ceous substance. Pure cream, ripe natural fruits, or good 
extracts of the same, and sugar of the purest quality, com- 
bine to make a perfect ice-cream. To freeze the cream, 
assuming it be already flavored, first pound up ice and mix 
with it a quantity of coarse salt, in the proportion of about 
one-third the quantity of salt to the amount of ice used. 
Put the freezing-can in the centre of the tub, taking care 
that the lid is securely fastened down, and pile the mixed 
ice and salt around it to within three inches of the top, or 
certainly as high as the cream reaches on the inside. 

Begin to stir the cream at once, and stir rapidly and con- 
stantly. This is essential to make the cream smooth. If 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 167 

the cream is allowed to freeze to the sides of the can with- 
out being quickly removed, there will inevitably be lumps 
of ice through it. The freezing has progressed sufficiently 
far when the cream will stand heaped upon a spoon. 

When a small can of cream has been made for table use, 
it is desirable to serve it in a cylindrical form as it comes 
solid from the can. To remove it in this form, take the can 
from the ice and wipe off all the salt and ice which adheres 
to it. Remove the lid and invert the can upon a plate. 
Wrap about the can a towel wet with warm water. This 
will sufficiently relax the freezing within the can to allow 
the cream to slide out in compact form. Molds of 
cream may be removed in the same manner, by dipping 
them in warm water for a moment. Water-ices and frozen 
fruits need the same general treatment. 

For whipping cream, etc., some of the improved beaters, 
described at the end of this department, will be found to be 
superior to the old hand methods. In all delicate dishes the 
best ingredients must invariably be used. 

RECIPES. 

Vanilla IceKsream. — Two quarts of pure cream, fourteen 
ounces of white sugar, flavored with vanilla bean or extract 
of vanilla to taste ; mix well, and freeze as directed 
above. Pure cream needs no thickening or boiling. Milk 
may be boiled or thickened with arrow-root or corn- 
starch, but it will not produce ice cream. 

Lemon Ice-cream. — For the same quantity of cream and 
sugar, as above, stir in the juice of from four to eight 
lemons, according to size and juiciness, and grate in a little 
of the rind. Then freeze as above. 

Orange Ice-cream. — Proceed as in lemon cream, using 
oranges, and regulating the quantity of sugar as the fruit is 
more or less sweet. 



168 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Chocolate IceKireain. — For one gallon of ice-cream, grate 
fine about one-half cake of Baker's chocolate ; make ice- 
cream as for the recipe above ; flavor lightly with vanilla 
and stir in the chocolate. 

Strawberry Ice-cream. — Mash one pint of fresh, ripe straw- 
berries ; sprinkle them with half a pound of fine sugar ; let 
it stand about an hour ; strain though a fine sieve, or a 
cloth ; if the sugar is not dissolved, stir it well ; add a little 
water; stir this juice into the cream prepared as above and 
freeze. 

Raspberry Icecream. — Make the same as strawberry, sub- 
stituting the raspberries merely. 

Peach. Ice-cream. — Take fine, ripe freestone peaches ; pare, 
chop fine, niash, and work as for strawberry cream. 

Pine-apple Ice-cream, — Pare the fruit, shred fine, and work as 
in strawberry cream. 

Orange Water-ice. — Take one dozen oranges ; grate the 
skin and squeeze out the juice; add six quarts of water 
and ten ounces of white sugar to each quart of water ; mix 
well and put into the freezer. Be careful to stir steadily 
while freezing, or the mixture will cake into lumps. The 
amount of sugar and of orange-juice may be varied to suit 
taste. 

Lemon Water-ice. — -To one quart of water, add the juice of 
four lemons and one pound of sugar. Then proceed as 
above. Currants, raspberries, strawberries, and all the juicy 
fruits may be treated in the same way. 

Tutti Frutti. — One quart of rich cream, one and one-half 
ounces of sweet almonds, chopped fine ; one-half pound 
of sugar ; freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, add one- 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. Igg 

half pound of preserved fruits, with a few white raisins 
chopped, and finely sliced citron. Cut the fruit small, and 
mix well with the cream. Freeze like ice-cream, and keep 
on ice until required. 

Frozen rruits.— Take two quarts of rich cream and two 
teacupfuls of sugar, mix well together and put into a freezer 
with ice and salt packed around it. Have ready one quart 
of peaches, mashed and sweetened. When the cream is 
very cold, stir them in and freeze all together. Strawberries 
can be used in the same way, but will require more sugar. 
Cherries are specially delightful in this form. 

WMpped Cream. — To one quart of cream whipped very 
thick, add powdered sugar to taste ; then add one tumbler 
of wine. Make just before using. 

Italian Cream. — Divide two pints of cream equally in two 
bowls ; with one bowl mix six ounces of powdered sugar, 
the juice of two large lemons, and two glassfuls of white 
wine ; then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole 
very hard ; boil two ounces of isinglass with four small tea- 
cupfuls of water till reduced one-half; then stir the isinglass, 
lukewarm, in the other ingredients ; put them in a glass dish 
to harden. 

Syllabub. — Whip a small cupful of powdered sugar into a 
quart of rich cream, and another cupful of sugar into the 
whites of four eggs. Mix these together, and add a glass 
of white wine and flavoring to taste, 

SpaJlis]l Cream. — Three half-pints of milk, half a box of 
gelatine, five tablespoonfuls of white sugar, three eggs, and 
two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Soak the gelatine in cold milk ; 
put on to boil ; when boiling, add the yelks of the eggs 
with the sugar and flavoring extract beaten together. When 
it thickens to the consistency of cream, or after about three 



170 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

minutes' boiling, take off the fire, and stir in the whites of 
the eggs well beaten. Pour into molds, and set aside to 
cool. To be eaten cold, with or without cream. 

Tapioca Cream. — Soak half a cupful of tapioca in water 
over night. Let a quart of milk get steaming hot, and add 
to it the tapioca. Let it boil three minutes, then mix five 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar with the yelks of four eggs ; 
stir them into the milk and tapioca, and let it come to a boil 
again. Beat the whites up stiff; stir them rapidly and 
thoroughly through the boiling tapioca; add two table- 
spoonfuls of wine and a pinch of salt. Let it stand till 
cold and garnish with macaroons. 

Orange Cream. — Put half a box of gelatine to soak for hali 
an hour in cold water enough to cover it. Take three half- 
pints of cream, whip half of it, and heat the other half; dis- 
solve the gelatine in the heated cream ; then strain it, and 
return to the boiler again. Take the yelks of five eggs and 
a cupful of sugar ; beat them together till light, and add to 
the boiling cream ; cook about two minutes, stirring con- 
stantly ; take from the fire, and while it cooks, stir in the 
whipped cream and the juice of four oranges, and pour into 
a mold to stiffen. Stir the cream constantly before putting 
into the mold, to prevent it from thickening in lumps. 

Pink Cream. — Three gills of strawberry or currant juice ; 
mix with one-half pound of powdered sugar, one-half pint of 
thick cream ; whisk until well mixed ; serve in a glass dish. 

Chocolate Bavarian Cream. — Whip one pint of cream to a 
stiff froth, laying it on a sieve ; boil a pint of rich milk with 
a vanilla bean and two tablespoonfuls of sugar until it is well 
flavored ; then take it off the fire and add half a box of gela- 
tine, soaked for an hour in half a cupful of water in a warm 
place near the range ; when slightly cooled, add two tablets 
of Baker's chocolate, soaked and smoothed. Stir in the eggs 



CPEAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. \1l 

well-beaten. When it has become quite cold and begins to 
thicken, stir it without ceasing a few minutes, until it is very 
smooth ; then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it is 
well mixed. Put it into a mold or molds, and set it on ice 
or in a cool place. 

Turret Cream. — Soak one box of gelatine in a cupful of 
milk four hours. Scald three cupfuls of milk ; add one cup- 
ful of the sugar ; when this is dissolved, add the soaked 
gelatine. Stir over the fire until almost boiling hot ; strain 
and divide into two equal portions. Return one to the fire 
and heat quickly. When it nears the boiling-point, stir in 
the beaten yelks of three eggs. Let all cook together two 
minutes, and turn out into a bowl to cool. When it has 
cooled, churn one pint of cream very stiff, and beat the 
whites of the eggs until they will stand alone. Divide the 
latter into two heaps. As the yellow gelatine begins to 
" form," whip one-half of the whites into it, a little at a time. 
To the white gelatine add the rest of the whites in the same 
manner, alternately with the whipped cream. Season the 
yellow with vanilla, the white with lemon juice beaten in at 
the last. Wet the inside of a tall, fluted mold with water, 
and arrange in the bottom, close to the outside of the mold, 
a row of crystallized cherries. Then put in a layer of the 
white mixture ; on this crystallized apricots or peaches cut 
into strips ; a layer of the yellow, another border of cherries, 
and so on until your mold is full. When firm, which will be 
in a JEbw hours if set on ice, wrap a cloth wrung out in hot 
water about the mold, and invert upon a flat dish. Eat with 
sweet cream, or, if you like, with brandied fruit. Not only 
is this a very palatable dish, but it is also very beautiful, well 
repaying the trouble of its preparation. 

Velvet Cream. — Half an ounce of isinglass dissolved in one 
and a half cupfuls of white wine ; then add the juice and 
grated peel of a lemon, three-quarters of a pound of loaf 



1 72 THE no USE WIFE'S LI BEAR Y. 

sugar ; simmer all together until mixed well ; strain and add 
one and a half pints of rich cream, and stir until cool ; pour 
into molds, and let it stand till stiff enough to turn out. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. — Take one pair of calf's feet, and put 
them into a gallon of water ; let it boil half away and skim 
constantly ; strain it when cold ; take the fat from the top 
and bottom ; then warm it ; add sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, a pint of Madeira wine, and the whites of seven 
eggs ; boil it half an hour, strain through a flannel bag, and 
cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly. — One box of Coxe's gelatine dissolved in one 
pint of cold water, one pint of wine, one quart of boiling 
water, two cupfuls of granulated sugar, and three lemons. 
Cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly, No. 2. — Soak one package of sparkling gelatine 
in a large cupful of cold water. Add to this all the juice 
and half the rind of a lemon, two cupfuls of white sugar, and 
a half teaspoonful of bitter almond or two peach leaves, and 
cover for half an hour ; then pour on boiling water, stir, and 
strain. After adding two cupfuls of pale sherry or white 
wine, strain again through a flannel bag. Wet a mold and 
set it in a cold place until the next day. 

JeUy Oranges. — Soak a package of Coxe's gelatine about 
three hours in a cup of cold water. Cut from the top of each 
of a dozen fine oranges a round piece, leaving a hole just 
large enough to admit the bowl of a small spoon or the 
handle of a larger. The smaller the orifice, the better your 
dish will look. Clean out every bit of the pulp very care- 
fully, so as not to tear the edges of the hole. Scrape the 
inner skin from the sides with your fore-finger, and when the 
oranges are emptied lay them in cold water while you make 
the jelly. Strain the juice of all and grated peel of three of 
the oranges through coarse, thin muslin over three cupfuls 
of sugar, squeezing rather hard to eet the coloring- matter. 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 173 

Stir this until it is a thick sirup, and add a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon. Pour two cupfuls of boiling water upon the 
soaked gelatine, and stir over the fire until well dissolved ; 
add the juice and sugar, stir all together, and strain through 
a flannel bag into a pitcher, not shaking or squeezing it, lest 
it should become cloudy. Wipe off the outside of the 
oranges, set them close together in a dish, the open ends 
uppermost, and fill very full with the warm jelly, as it will 
shrink in cooling. Set it away in a cold place where there 
is no dust. Next day cut each in half with a sharp knife, 
taking care to sever the skin all around before cutting into 
the jelly. If neatly divided, the rich amber jelly will be a 
fair counterfeit of the orange pulp. Pile in a glass dish, 
with green leaves around, as you would the real fruit. This 
is a delicious dish, and it is highly ornamental on the table. 

Apple Jelly. — Soak half a package Coxe's gelatine in one 
cupful of cold water. Pare, core, and slice a dozen well- 
flavored pippins, throwing each piece into cold water as it 
is cut to preserve the color. Pack them in a glass or stone- 
ware jar with just cold water enough to cover them ; cover 
the jar loosely that the steam may escape ; set in a pot of 
warm water and bring to a boil. Cook until the apples are 
broken into pieces. Have ready in a bowl the soaked gela- 
tine, two cupfuls of powdered sugar, thejuice of two lemons, 
and the grated peel of one. Strain the apple pulp scalding 
hot over them ; stir until the gelatine is dissolved ; strain 
again through a flannel bag, without shaking or squeezing 
it ; wet a mold with cold water, fill it, and set in a cold 
place until firm. This preparation is greatly improved if 
formed in a mold with a cylinder in the centre, the cavity 
being filled and heaped with whipped cream br syllabub. 

Peach Jelly.— Proceed as in apple jelly, using peaches, 
with a few peach-kernels broken up and boiled with the 
fruit. 



174 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

Lemon Jelly. — Stir together two large cupfuls of sugar, the 
juice of six lemons and grated peel of two, and a package of 
well-soaked gelatine. Cover tor an hour. Pour three pints 
of boiling water over them ; stir until the gelatine is quite 
melted; strain through a close flannel bag, and pour into a 
wet mold. 

Orange Jelly. — Soak a package of gelatine in two cupfuls 
of water ; add two cupfuls of sugar, the juice of six large 
oranges, and grated peel of one, the juice of two lemons, 
and peel of one, and cover for an hour. Pour three pints 
of boiling water over them ; stir until the gelatine is quite 
melted ; strain through a flannel bag ; add a little good 
brandy if desired and strain again ; pour into a wet mold. 

Orange Trifle. — Stir half a package of soaked gelatine into 
a cupful of boiling water. Mix the juice of two oranges 
and rind of one with a cupful of powdered sugar, and pour 
the hot liquid over them. Should the gelatine not dissolve 
readily, set all over the fire and stir until clear. Strain, and 
stir in the beaten yelks of three eggs. Heat quickly within 
a vessel of boiling water, stirring constantly lest the yelks 
curdle. If they do curdle, strain again through coarse flan- 
nel. Set aside until perfectly cold and slightly stiff", then 
whip in a pint of frothed cream. Wet a mold, fill, and set it 
on ice. 

Orange Dessert. — Pare five or six oranges ; cut into thin 
slices ; pour over them a coffeecupful of sugar. Boil one 
pint of milk ; add, while boiling, the yelks of three eggs, 
one tablespoonful of corn-starch (made smooth with a little 
cold milk) ; stir all the time ; as soon as thickened, pour 
over the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar ; pour over the cus- 
*:ard, and brown slightly in the oven. Serve cold.

Apple Snow. — Grate half a dozen apples to a pulp ; press 
them through a sieve ; add half a cupful of powdered sugar 
and a teaspoonful of extract of lemon ; take the whites of 
six eggs, whip them for several minutes, and sprinkle two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar over them; beat the 
apple pulp to a froth, and add the beaten egg ; whip the 
mixture until it looks like stiff snow ; then pile it high in 
rough portions on a glass dish ; garnish with small spoonfuls 
of currant jelly. 

Floatiiig Island. — Beat the yelks of six eggs until very 
light ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; stir into a quart of boil- 
ing milk ; cook till it thickens ; when cool, pour into a low 
glass dish ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; 
sweeten, and place over a dish of boiling water to cook. 
Take a tablespoon and drop on the whites of the cream, far 
enough apart so that the " little white islands " will not 
touch each other. By dropping little specks of bright 
jelly on each island a pleasing effect will be produced. 

Blanc-mange. — Take one quart of milk, one ounce gelatine, 
and sugar to sweeten to taste ; put it on the fire, and keep 
stirring until it is all melted, then pour it into a bowl and 
stir until cold ; season with vanilla; pour it into a mold, 
and set in a cool place to stiffen. 

Tapioca Blanc-mange. — Take one pint of new milk, half a 
pound of the best farina-tapioca soaked in water four 
hours, three-fourths of a cupful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of 
almond or vanilla extract, a little salt. Heat the milk, and 
stir the soaked tapioca. When it has dissolved, add the 
sugar. Boil slowly fifteen minutes, stirring all the time ; 
take from the fire, and beat until nearly cold. Flavor and 
pour into a mold dipped in cold water. Sago blanc-mange 
may be made in the same manner.

nearly cold, beat until it begins to stiffen. Flavor with 
vanilla ; whip up once, and put into a wet mold. It will be 
firm in six or eight hours. 

Neapolitan Blanc-mange. — Dissolve one-third of a box of 
gelatine, and stir into one quart of milk. Add three-fourths 
of a cupful of sugar. As soon as the gelatine is thoroughly 
dissolved, remove from the fire, and divide into three parts.

mold — first the white, then the yellow, and last the brown. 

Peach Meringue. — Put on to boil a scant quart of new milk, 
omitting half a teacupful, with which moisten two table- 
spoonfuls of corn-starch. When the milk boils, add corn- 
starch, stir constantly, and when it commences to thicken, 
remove from the fii-e ; add one tablespoonful of perfectly 
sweet butter ; let cool ; then beat in the yelks of three eggs

cupful of fine suga,r ; cover the bottom of a well-buttered 
baking-dish with ripe, juicy peaches, that have been pared. 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 177 

stoned, and halved ; sprinkle two tablespoonfuls of sugar 
over the fruit, pour the custard over gently, and bake in a 
quick oven twenty minutes ; draw it out, and cover with the 
well-beaten whites of the three eggs ; sprinkle a little fine 
sugar over the top, and set in the oven until brown. Eat 
warm with sauce, or cold with cream.

Pigs a la Genevieve. — Dissolve two ounces of best sugar 
in half a pint of cold water in an enameled stewpan, with 
half the very thin rind of a large lemon ; when this is done, 
put into it half a pound of Turkey figs, and put the stew- 
pan over a moderate fire, so that the figs may stew very 
slowly ; when quite soft, add one glassful of common port 
or any other wine, and the strained juice of half a lemon ; 
serve them cold for dessert. About two hours or two hours 
and a half is the average time for stewing the figs, and the 
flavor may be varied by using orange peel and juice in- 
stead of lemon, and by boiling two or three bitter almonds 
in the sirup. 

Biscuit Glace. — Make a quart of rich boiled custard, flavor 
it with vanilla, and let it cool. Then mix with it a quart of 
grated pineapple or mashed peaches. Stir them well to- 
gether, and add enough sugar to allow for the loss in freez- 
ing. Freeze in the usual way, stirring in a pint of cream, ' 
whipped, when it is beginning to set in the freezer. Partly 
fill little paper cases with the mixture, and smooth the tops 
nicely. Place them carefully in the cleaned and dried freezer, 
and let them remain embedded in ice for several hours. 
Sometimes the cases are filled with pistachio or chocolate 
ice-cream, in which case blanched almonds are laid over the 
top, when they are served. Or they may be filled with 
frozen whipped cream, and served with a spoonful of some 
bright sherbet upon the top of each.

BEST MATERIALS REQUISITE FOR CAKE-MAKING J WHAT THEY 
SHOULD be; weighing AND MEASURING INGREDIENTS; HOW 
TO MIX cake; FRUITS AND FLAVORS FOR CAKE; HOW TO BAKE 
CAKE ; HOW TO TEST IT ; HOW TO KEEP IT ; HOW TO ICE IT. 
NINETY-SEVEN RECIPES FOR CAKES. 

IN cake-making it is absolutely essential that the best 
materials be employed. Stale eggs, strong butter, musty 
flour, or common sugar are not so much as to be 
thought of in this connection. The idea that such refuse 
" will do for cooking " is most unworthy. When a luxury, 
such as cake, is attempted, the maker should certainly be 
willing to luxuriate in acceptable ingredients. 

Flour for cake should be white and dry. It should always 
be carefully sifted. Sugar should be white, dry, and free 
from lumps. Eggs and butter should be sweet and fresh ; 
the milk rich and pure. Fruit and extracts must be of the 
best. The weighing and measuring of ingredients must be 
accurately done. Guessing at quantities has spoiled many 
a cake. 

For mixing cake, an earthen or wooden dish and a 
wooden spoon are requisite. Butter and sugar should be 
beaten together to a cream before using. Butter may be 
softened for this purpose, if too hard to manage readily, but 
it must not be melted; Whites and yelks of eggs must be 
beaten separately, until there is no stringiness visible, and 
the froth can be taken up on a spoon. Beat eggs in a broad, 
shallow dish, and in a cool place. It is well to lay the eggs 
in cold water for an hour before beating them, as they will 
beat the lighter for such treatment. Sweet milk is best for 

179 



180 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBKARY. 

solid cake ; sour milk, for light cake. The two should never 
be mixed. 

Baking-powder should be mixed dry through the flour. 
Soda and cream of tartar' should be dissolved in milk. 
Flavoring extracts, fruit, and spices must be added the last 
thing, and fruit should always be well sprinkled with flour 
before it is put in the dough. Currants and such fruit 
should be washed, picked over, and dried before using. 
Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water over 
them till they pop from their skins. Cake should be beaten 
as little as possible after the flour has been added. When 
it requires long baking, the bottom and sides of the pan 
should be lined with paper well buttered. This will insure 
the easy turning out of the cake when done. 

Much of the success in cake-baking depends on the heat- 
ing of the oven. If the oven is very hot when the cake 
goes in, it will bake on top before it becomes light. If the 
oven is too cool, it will rise and fall again before done. If 
the top of the cake browns too fast, cover it with thick 
paper. Try it by inserting a broom-splinter or knitting- 
needle in the thickest part of the cake, and if nothing ad- 
heres when it is drawn out, it is done. Turn out of the tins 
at once, taking care not to expose the cake to draft. 

Cake should be kept in earthen pans or crocks, or tin 
boxes, but never in wooden boxes or drawers. It will keep 
better for being wrapped in a cloth, and more than is needed 
should not be cut. 

Cake that is to be frosted should be baked in pans with 
perpendicular sides. The icing should be put on as soon 
as the cake is removed from the oven. This will insure its 
drying smooth and hard.

Cocoanut Cake. — Two eggs, one cupful white sugar, one- 
half a cupful sweet milk, one-quarter cupful of butter, one 
and one-half cupfuls of flour, one and one-half teaspoonfuls 
baking-powder. Bake in a moderate oven in pans one inch 
deep. To prepare the desiccated cocoanut, beat the whites 
of two eggs to a stiff froth, add one cupful of pulverized 
sugar and the cocoanut, aftpr soaking it in boiling milk. 
Spread the mixture between the layers of cake and over 
the top. 

White Mountaiii Cake. — Make the cake with one pound of 
fiour, one pound of sugar, half a pound of butter, six eggs, 
one cupful of milk, one small teaspoonful of saleratus dis- 
solved in the milk. Bake four thin cakes in flat pie plates ; 
frost each of these cakes, laying one on another. When 
all are done, even the edges with a knife and frost the sides. 
Use the following frosting preparation : Beat to a standing 
froth the whites of four eggs made thick v/ith sifted, refined 
sugar, and add the sugar and juice of one lemon. 

Delicate Cake. — Two cupfuls of pulverized sugar, half a 
cupful of butter, three cupfuls of flour, nearly three-fourths 
of a cupful of milk, whites of eight eggs, half a teaspoonful

cake with one cupful of milk, and one teaspoonful of corn- 
starch dissolved in it, and brought to a boiling heat, with the 
yelk of one egg dropped in to color it. Flavor with lemon 
or vanilla ; let it cool. Bake your cake in round pie-tins ; 
use just enough batter in the tin so that when they are 
baked two of them put together will make one proper 
sized cake. Make the custard first, and let it cool ; put the

ineal or with red sugar. 

Mix a brown portion thus: Three eggs beaten light, 
one cupful of powdered sugar, quarter cupful of butter 
creamed with sugar, two tablespoonfuls of -cream, one heap~ 
ing cupful of prepared flour, two tablespoonfuls of vanilla 
chocolate grated and rubbed smooth in the cream, before it 
is beaten into the cake. 

Bake each of these parts in jelly-cake tins. The above 
quantities should make three cakes of each color. 

Mix a filling for the cake thus : Two cupfuls of sweet 
milk, two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch, wet with milk, two

eggs, two small cupfuls of fine sugar. Heat the milk, stir in 
the sugar and corn-starch, boil five minutes, and put in the 
eggs. Stir steadily until it- becomes quite thick. Divide 
this custard into two parts. Stir into one two tablespoonfuls 
of grated chocolate and a teaspoonful of vanilla ; into the 
other, bitter almond. 

Prepare another filling thus : Whites of three eggs, 
whisked stiff, one heaping cup of powdered sugar, juice and 
half the grated peel of one lemon. Whip all together well. 
Lay the brown cake as the foundation of the pile ; spread 
with the yellow custard; add the pink, coated with choco- 
late ; then add the white and yellow with the frosting be- 
tween them. Vary the order as fancy dictates. Cover the 
top with powdered sugar or with icing. 

Angel's Pood. — Use the whites of eleven eggs, a scant pint 
of granulated sugar, a large half pint of flour, one teaspoonful 
of cream tartar (even full), and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Sift 
the flour four times, then measure ; add cream of tartar, and 
then sift again. Sift the sugar four times, then measure it. 
Beat the eggs to a stiff froth on a large dish, and on same 
dish add the sugar quickly and lightly; add the flour in the 
same way, and last of all the vanilla. Put at once into a 
moderate oven, and bake forty minutes or more. Do not 
grease the pans. Turn upside down to cool, putting small 
blocks of wood under the edges that air may reach the cake. 

Macaroons. — Blanch half a pound of almonds with boiling 
water, and pound them to a smooth paste. Add a table- 
spoonful of essence of lemon, half a pound of powdered 
sugar, and the whites of two eggs. Work the paste well to- 
gether with the back of a spoon. Wet your hands, and roll 
them in balls the size of a nutmeg, and lay them an inch 
apart on a sheet of paper. Wet your finger, and press gently 
over the surface to make them shiny. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour in a very moderate oven.- 



CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. J 97 

Chocolate Macaroons. — Put three ounces of plain chocolate 
in a pan, and melt on a slow fire ; then wofk it to a thick 
paste with one pound of powdered sugar and the whites of 
three eggs ; roll the mixture down to the thickness of 
about one-quarter of an inch ; cut it in small, round pieces 
with a paste-cutter, either plain or scalloped ; butter a pan 
slightly, and dust it with flour and sugar in equal quanti- 
ties ; place in it the pieces of paste or mixture, and bake in 
a hot but not quick oven. 

Cream Puffs. — Stir one-half pounjd.of butter into a pint of 
warm water, set it on the fire in a saucepan, and slowly 
bring it to a boil, stirring often. When it boils, put in three- 
quarters of a pound of flour, and let it boil one minute, stir- 
ring constantly. Take from the fire, and turn into a deep 
dish to cool. Beat eight eggs light, and whip into this cool 
paste, first the yelks, then the whites. Drop in great spoon- 
fuls on buttered paper so as not to touch or run into each 
other, and bake ten minutes. Split them, and fill with the 
following cream : One quart of milk, four tablespoonfuls of 
eorn-starch, two eggs, two cupfuls of sugar. Stir while boil- 
ing, and when thick, add a teaspoonful of butter. When 
cold, flavor. 

Kisses. — Beat the whites- of four eggs very stiff, add one- 
half pound of pulverized sugar, and flavor to taste. Beat 
until very light, then lay in heaps the size of an ^%g on 
paper. Place the paper on a piece of wood half an inch 
thick, and put in a hot oven. Make the surface shiny by 
passing over it a wet knife. Bake until they look yellowish, 
when they are done. 

Chocolate Kisses. — Beat stiff the whites of two eggs; beat in 
gradually one-half pound of powdered sugar. Scrape fine 
one and a half ounces of chocolate ; dredge with flour, mixing 
the flour well ; add this gradually to the eggs and sugar, stir- 
ring the whole very hard. Cover the bottom of a pan with 



198 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

white paper, and place on it spots of powdered sugar the 
size of half-dollars. Heap the mixture on these spots, 
smooth witli a broad knife, sift with powdered sugar, and 
bake quickly. 

Cocoanut Steeples. — One pound of powdered sugar ; one- 
half pound of grated cocoanut ; whites of five eggs. Whip 
the eggs as for icing, adding the sugar as you go on until it 
will stand alone, then beat in the cocoanut. Mold the mix- 
ture with your hands into small cones, and set these far 
enough apart not to touch one another upon buttered paper 
in a baking-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. 

Meringues. — Mix the whites of four eggs, beaten to a stiff 
froth, with one pound of pulverized sugar, and flavored to 
the taste. Beat stiff, bake the same as macaroons, when 
light brown, slip them from the papers, and put the smooth 
sides together, with jelly between. 

Lady-fingers. — One-half pound pulverized sugar and six 
yelks of eggs, well stirred ; add one-fourth pound flour, 
whites of six eggs, well beaten. Bake in lady-finger tins, 
or squeeze through a bag of paper in strips two or three 
inches long. 

Lady-fingers, No. 2. — Rub half a pound of butter into a 
pound of flour ; to this add half a pound of sugar, the juice 
and grated rind of one large lemon, and, lastly, three eggs, 
the whites and yelks beaten separately, and the whites stirred 
in after all the other ingredients are well mixed together. 
This dough, if properly made, will be stiff enough to make 
rolls about the size of a lady's finger ; it will spread when 
in the oven, so that it will be of the right size and shape. 
If you wish them to be especially inviting, dip them in cho- 
colate icing after they are baked, and put two together. 
See that the icing is so hard that it will not run, and set the 
cakes on a platter in a cool room until the icing is firm. 



CAKES AND CaKE-BAKING. J 99 

Ftlairs a la Creme. — Three-fourths pound flour, one pint 
water, ten eggs, one-half cupful butter. Put the water on 
the fire in a stewpan with the butter ; as soon as it boils 
stir in the sifted flour ; stir well until it leaves the bottom 
and sides of the pan, when taken from the fire ; then add 
the eggs, one at a time. Put the batter in a bag of paper, 
and press out in the shape of fingers on a greased tin. 
When cold, fill with cream, prepared as follows : One and 
one-half pints of milk, two cupfuls sugar, yelks of five eggs, 
one tablespoonful butter, three large tablespoonfuls corn- 
starch, two teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. Frosted with choco- 
late, they are much improved in appearance and flavor. 

Icing for Cakes. — In making icing, use at least a quarter of 
a pound of pulverized sugar to the white of each egg ; if 
not stiff enough, add more sugar. Break the whites into a 
broad, cool dish, and throw in a small handful of sugar. 
Begin whipping it in with long, even strokes of the beater, 
adding the sugar gradually. Beat until the icing is smooth 
and firm, then add the flavoring. Spread it on the cake 
with a broad-bladed knife, dipped in cold water. If orna- 
mentation of the icing is desired, it may be done by affixing 
prepared leaves, flowers, etc., which can be had at the con- 
fectioners' stores or at their supply stores. To make letters, 
tracery, etc., for cakes, roll into a funnel shape a piece of 
thick, white paper; fill this with icing in the soft state, 
allowing it to drip out slowly from the small end of the 
paper cone. Apply this carefully, and allow it to harden. 

Orange Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, and the juice of a large orange, treated 
as above. 

Lemon Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, juice and part of the rind of one lemon. 

Chocolate Icing, — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 



200 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

pulverized sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of grated choco- 
late. 

Almond Icing. — The whites of three eggs, one cupful of 
pounded blanched almonds, three-quarters of a pound of 
pulverized sugar, and a little almond extract. 

Banana Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of pul- 
verized sugar, and one banana finely crushed through it. 
This cake should be eaten the same day it is made, as the 
banana discolors over night. 

Cocoanut Frosting. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound 
of pulverized sugar. Spread on the cake, then sprinkle 
thickly with grated cocoanut. This will make a whiter frost- 
ing than results from stirring in the cocoanut. 

Cooked Frosting. — One cupful of granulated sugar, wet 
with a little water. Let it boil without stirring until it be- 
gins to thicken. Beat the whites of two eggs very light. 
Strain the boiled sugar into them slowly, beating all the 
time. Flavor to taste. 



XIV.— FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 

VALUE OF FRESH FRUITS ON THE TABLE j ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS; 
NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FRUITS; WHERE TO GATHER AND-HOW 
TO STORE FRUITS. TWENTY-TWO RECIPES FOR SERVING FRESH 
FRUITS AND NUTS. 

FRESH fruits are a most delij,htful accessory to the 
table supply of both rich and poor. They are so great 
in variety, so rich in flavor, so beautiful in appearance, 
so healthful, and of so long continuance in most parts of the 
country, that it behooves every housekeeper to familiarize 
herself with the best methods of using fresh fruits to 
advantage. 

A few years ago each locality depended upon its own 
local crop of fruits. Now the railroads bring early fruits 
from the far South and late fruits from the far North, so 
that at the centres of population the several fruit seasons are 
delightfully prolonged. Nor are we restricted to our own 
country's production. Such are the facilities for rapid and 
safe communication from distant points, that the world lays 
her tribute of fruits, sweet and sound, at the door of the 
enlightened nations. 

Fruits do not take an important place as nutrients. They 
belong rather among the luxuries, and yet, as an agreeable 
stimulant to digestion, they occupy a front rank. In many 
conditions of health, some of the fruits are the only articles 
the invalid can enjoy, and their genial influences contribute 
greatly to the general improvement of a patient's appetite. 

Fruits intended for immediate use should be gathered 
early in the morning, while the coolness of the night dews 

201 



202 ^-^^ J^O USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

is upon them. They should be just ripe, neither overdone 
nor underdone, in nature's great process of preparing them 
for human food. Fruit for storage is best gathered at the 
middle of a dry day. It should be nearly ripe. If unripe, 
or overripe it will not keep well. A moist atmosphere, but 
not one positively damp, is best for the storing of fruit. An 
ordinary cellar does better than a dry storeroom. Fruit 
keeps better in the dark than in the light. 

All varieties of nuts belong to the albuminous fruits and 
are very nutritious, though the richer nuts are not easy 
of digestion owing to their oily properties. 

The supply of peanuts once came wholly from Africa, but 
our Southern States have so successfully cultivated this 
popular nut that we are now independent. The bulk of the 
supply is from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 
During a single season the crop of Virginia rose to one 
million one hundred thousand bushels, of Tennessee, five 
hundred and fifty thousand bushels, and of North Carolina, 
one hundred and twenty thousand bushels. 

The Texas pecan is especially in demand. While a few 
years ago several barrels of pecans abundantly supplied the 
demand, carloads and invoices of one or two hundred bar- 
rels are not now uncommon. 

In the Eastern States hickory nuts are sufficiently plenti- 
ful to ship to New York half a dozen carloads a week when 
demanded. 

The chestnut is becoming scarcer every year, but their 
great popularity will probably prevent their total disappear- 
ance, as they are already being successfully cultivated, and 
it is expected that in a few years the cultivated nut will equal 
in quality the high-priced Italian chestnuts. 

RECIPES. 

Watermelons. — Wipe watermelons clean when they are 
taken from the ice. They should lie on ice for at least four 



FSESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 203 

hours before they are eaten. Cut off a slice at each end of 
the watermelon, then cut through the centre ; stand on end 
on platter, and slice down, allowing each slice a part of the 
centre, or heart. 

Nutmegs, etc. — Wash nutmegs and muskmelons; wipe 
dry ; cut in two ; shake out the seeds lightly, and put a 
lump of ice in each half Eat with pepper and salt. A sil- 
ver spoon is a neat and pleasant article with which to eat 
small, ripe melons. 

Pineapples. — Slice on a slaw-cutter, or very thin with a 
knife ; mix with finely powdered sugar. Set on ice till ready 
to serve. 

Oranges are nice served whole, the skins quartered and 
turned down. Form in a pyramid with bananas and white 
grapes. 

Orange and Cocoannt — A layer of oranges sliced, then 
sugar, then a layer of cocoanut, grated ; then another of 
oranges, and so on until the dish is full. This is by many 
known as Ambrosia. 

Sliced Peaches. — Peel and slice ripe peaches. Lay them in 
a dish with plenty of sugar for an hour or two, till tea time. 
Eat with cream. 

Stewed Peaches. — Make a sirup of sugar and water ; halve 
the peaches, leaving the stone in one half, and drop into 
sirup. Allow the whole to simmer slowly until fruit is ten- 
der; then remove fruit, and let sirup boil till thick; then pour 
over fruit and serve at once. 

Frosted Peaches. — Put half a cupful of water and the 
beaten whites of three eggs together ; dip in each peach, 
using- fine, large freestones, after you have rubbed off 
the fur with a clean cloth ; and then roll in powdered sugar. 
Set them on the stem end, upon a sheet of white paper, in 
a sunny window. When half dry, roll again in the sugar. 



204 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRAR-i. 

Expose to the sun and breeze until perfectly dry. Until 
ready to arrange them in the glass dish for table, keep in 
a cool, dry place. Decorate with green leaves. 

Fried Peaches. — Cut the peaches in two, and remove the 
stones. Dust a little flour on the side from which the stone 
is taken, and fry, only on that side, in a little butter. When 
done, add sugar and a little butter. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core good, sound, tart apples. 
Fill them with sugar, butter, and a flavor of spice. Put a 
little, water in the pan, and bake until the apples are 
thoroughly tender. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice nice, juicy apples that 
are not very sweet ; put them in a stewpan with a little 
grated lemon peel, and water enough to keep them from 
burning. Stew till soft and tender ; mash to a paste, and 
sweeten well with brown sugar, adding a little butter and 
nutmeg. 

Apples with Lemon. — Make a sirup of sugar and water. 
Slice a lemon into it, and let boil until clear. Pare and core 
sound, tart apples, cut into quarters, and lay them carefully 
into the sirup ; let them cook gently until a straw can be 
run through them, taking care not to break them. Lay the 
pieces of apple in a glass dish, boil down the sirup, and 
when slightly cool, pour over the apples. 

Apple Float. — Pare, slice, and stew six large apples in as 
much water as will cover them ; when well done, press them 
through a sieve and sweeten highly with crushed sugar ; 
while cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, 
and stir into the apples ; flavor with lemon or vanilla ; serve 
with plenty of sweet cream. 

Transparent Apple. — Boil tart, ripe, and juicy apples in a 
little water; then strain, through a fine cloth, and add a 
pound of white sugar to a pint of juice. Boil till it jellies. 



FSESH FRVITS AND NUTS. 205 

and then put into molds. It is very nice served with blanc- 
mange in saucers. 

Baked Pears. — Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears, 
with their skins on, then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so 
on until the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it 
will hold. Bake three hours. 

Quinces. — Bake ripe quinces thoroughly ; when cold, strip 
off the skins, place the quinces in a glass dish, and sprinkle 
them with white sugar ; serve with rich cream. 

Bananas and Cream. — Peel, slice, and heap up in a glass 
dessert-dish, and serve raw, with fine sugar and cream. 

Fried Bananas. — Cut the bananas into slices, and fry in a 
little butter. This makes a very rich dish. 

Stewed Rhubarb. — Carefully remove the outer stringy 
skin ; then cut in pieces an inch long, and simmer gently till 
tender in water and sugar, and the rind and juice of a lemon. 
When done add a bit of butter and nutmeg. 

Crystallized Fruit. — Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit ; 
leave in the stones ; beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth ; lay the fruit in the beaten egg, with the stems 
upward ; drain them, and beat the part that drips off again ; 
select them out, one by one, and dip them into finely pow- 
dered sugar ; cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place 
the fruit on it, and set it in a cool place ; when the icing on 
the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a dish, and set them in 
a cold place. 

Candied Fruits. — Make a very rich sirup with one pound 
of granulated sugar to a gill of water. Heat over boiling 
water till the sugar is dissolved. Pare and halve fine, ripe, 
but solid peaches. Put a single layer of them in the sirup, 
in a shallow vessel ; cook slowly until clear ; drain from the 
sirup, and put to dry in a moderately heated oven. When 
fairly dry they may be eaten at once; or, after drying 



20G THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

twenty-four hours, they may be packed for future use. 
Plums, cherries, and pears may be candied in the same 
manner. 

Nuts. — Almonds are inseparably joined with raisins in 
table service ; so for evening uses, hickory nuts and apples 
form a pleasant combination. All the harder-shelled nuts 
should be well cracked before they are served. With the 
softer-shelled, nut crackers should be furnished. Nut picks 
should always be at hand. 

Sweet almonds, which are used for dessert, are of several 
varieties. Those known as the Syrian, or Jordan almonds, 
are regarded as the best. Those with hard shells are gen~ 
erally richer in flavor than those with the soft. Certainly 
the harder shell offers the more effective protection. The 
skin of almonds is not easily digested. For use in cooking 
they should be blanched, but for table use this is not desir- 
able. Walnuts keep well and improve with age. Of the 
hickory-nut family, the shell-bark is considered best. These, 
too, are the better for age. 



XV.— JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 

fruit for jellies, jams, and preserves j how prepared; 
proper sugar to use j quantity of sugar needed j suitable 
preserving-kettles; what not to use; the fire; cans 
AND jars; where stored; molding the jelly ; the jelly- 
bag ; straining jelly ; covering jelly, forty-four recipes 
for jellies, jams, and preserves. 

To insure success in preserving fruits, the first thing to 
be looked after is the fruit itself This should be fully 
ripe, fresh, sound, and scrupulously clean and dry. It 
should be gathered in the morning of a sunny day, as it will 
then possess its finest flavor. Care should be taken to re- 
move all bruised or decayed parts. Allowing them to re- 
main will darken the sirup, and consequently impair the 
beauty of the preserves. Fruit requiring to be pared should 
be laid in water to preserve the color after the paring. The 
best sugar is the cheapest ; indeed, there is no economy in 
stinting the sugar, either as to quality or proper quantity, 
for inferior sugar is wasted in scum, and the preserves will 
not keep unless a sufficient proportion of sugar is boiled 
with the fruit. At the same time, too large a proportion of 
sugar will destroy the natural flavor of the fruit, and in all 
probability make fruit candy, instead of the result sought. 

The usual proportion in making preserves, is a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. There are a few fruits which 
require more sugar. In making the sirup, use a small cup- 
ful of water to a pound of fruit. The sirup should always 
be boiled and strained before putting the fruit in. 

Fruit should be cooked in brass kettles, or those of bell- 
metal. Modern kettles, lined with porcelain, are much useil 

>207 



208 Tim HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

for this purpose. The kettle should be broad and shallow, 
so that there will be no necessity fof heaping the fruit. 
Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers, for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the color of red fruit into a 
dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor. 

Great care should be taken not to place the kettle flat 
upon the fire, as this will be likely to burn at the bottom. 

Glass jars are much the best for preserves, as the condi- 
tion of the fruit can be observed more readily. Whatever 
jars are used, however, the contents should be examined 
every three weeks for the first two months, and if there are 
any signs of either mold or fermentation it should be boiled 
over again. Preserves should be stored in a cool, dry place, 
but not in one into which fresh air never enters. Damp has 
a tendency to make the fruit mold, and heat to make it 
. ferment. 

A jelly-bag should be in every kitchen. It should be 
made of flannel, pointed at the bottom, so that the jelly will 
run out chiefly at one point. It is a good plan to sew a 
strong loop to the top of the bag, so that it may be hung 
upon a nail near the fire, that the juice of the fruit may run 
through gradually into a vessel below. The bag should not 
be squeezed with the hands, if you wish a very clear jelly. 
After the clear juice has been obtained, the remainder may 
be pressed, to make a very excellent, but inferior article of 
jelly or marmalade. 

Rinse the tumblers or bowls to be used in cold water 
just before filling with jelly or marmalade. When the jelly 
is cold, fit a circle of tissue-paper, dip it in brandy, and 
place it directly on the surface of the fruit. This simple 
precaution will save the housekeeper much annoyance by 
protecting the conserve from mold. Should the fungus form 
inside the upper cover of the glass, the inner will effectually 
shield the contents. Paste thick paper over the top of the 
fflass to exclude the air.

RECIPES. 

ClUTant Jelly. — Never gather currants or other soft or 
small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving pur- 
poses, as they are greatly impoverished by the moisture 
absorbed. In this climate, the first week in July is usually 
considered the time to make currant jelly. Weigh the cur- 
rants without removing the stems ; do not wash them, but 
remove leaves and whatever may adhere to them ; to each 
pound of fruit allow half the weight of granulated or pure 
loaf sugar ; put a few currants into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
and press them with a potato-masher, or anything conven- 
ient, in order to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning ; 
then add the remainder of the fruit and boil freely for twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning ; take out 
and strain through a jelly-bag, putting the liquid into earthen 
or wooden vessels. When strained, return the liquid to the 
kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil 
thoroughly for a moment or so ; then add the sugar ; the 
moment the sugar is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, 
and must be dished, or placed in glasses ; it will jelly upon 
the side of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as to 
the result. 

Currant Jelly, No. 2. — Take three quarts of fine, ripe, red 
currants, and four of white ; put them into a jar, tie paper 
over the top, and put them into a cool oven for three or four 
hours, or else into a pan of boiling water, or set them on 
the side of the range ; when they are thoroughly heated, 
strain through a jelly-bag. To every pint of juice, add one 
pound of granulated sugar, and boil from five to fifteen 
minutes ; turn while hot into wet tumblers. 

Currant JeUy without Cooking. — Press the juice from the 
currants and strain it ; to every pint put a pound of fine white 
sugar ; mix them together until the sugar is dissolved ; ther

put it in jars ; seal them and expose them to a hot sun for 
two or three days. 

Black Currant Jelly. — Boil the currants till the juice flows, 
then strain through a jelly-bag, and set it over the fire for 
twenty minutes, after which add half a pound of sugar to a 
pound of juice, and boil for about ten minutes. 

WMte Currant JeHy. — Strip the fruit off the stems, and 
pound it in a clean wooden bowl. Drip the juice gently 
through a jelly-bag. Prepare a very pure, clear sirup of the 
best white sugar; allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar; 
boil it ten minutes only. Put it in glass preserve -tumblers, 
cover with paper to fit exactly, and keep it dry and cool. 

Apple JeUy. — Take twenty large, juicy apples; pare and 
chop ; put into a jar with the rind of four large lemons, 
pared thin and cut in bits ; cover the jar closely, and set in 
a pot of boiling water ; keep water boiling all around it until 
the apples are dissolved ; strain through a jelly-bag, and 
mix with the liquid thejuice of four lemons ; to one pint of 
mixed juice use one pound of sugar; put in kettle, and when 
the sugar is melted set it on the fire, and boil and skim 
about twenty minutes, or until it is a thick, fine jelly. 

Apple JeUy, No. 2. — Peel and core sour apples ; boil them 
in a very little water, and strain them through a jelly-bag. 
Measure, and allow a pound of granulated sugar to a pint 
of juice. Mix the sugar and juice well together, and let it 
boil from five to ten minutes. Put it warm into glasses ; 
cut some white paper to fit the top, dip it in brandy, and lay 
on when the jelly is cool ; paste or tie thick paper over the 
glasses, and when cold put away in a dark, dry place. 

Crab-apple JeUy. — Wash and quarter Siberian crab-apples. 
Cover with cold water and let cook until thoroughly tender. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice add 
one pound of sugar. Let cook until it will jelly A slight 
flavoring of essence of cinnamon is an improvement. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 211 

Qnince Jelly. — Take very ripe quinces ; peel and core, and 
boil in a litde water till very soft; drain off the juice 
through a coarse towel, add an equal measure of sugar, and 
boil twenty minutes. 

Grape Jelly. — Mash the grapes thoroughly and strain 
out the juice. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil 
twenty minutes. 

Barberry JeUy. — Pick the berries from the stalks, mash 
them, and boil fifteen minutes. Squeeze through a jelly- 
bag ; allow a pound of white sugar to a pound of juice ; 
melt the sugar in the juice, and boil half an hour. 

Easpberry Jelly. — Crush the raspberries and strain through 
a wet cloth. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil from 
ten to twent)^ minutes. 

Apple Marmalade. — Pare, core, and slice two or three dozen 
tart, juicy apples ; three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice. Stew until tender in just enough cold 
water to cover them. Drain off the juice through a colan- 
der, and put into a preserving-kettle, stirring into it three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar for every pint of the liquid. 
Boil until it begins to jelly; strain the juice of two lemons 
into it; put in the apples, and stew pretty fast, stirring 
almost constantly, until it becomes thick and smooth. If 
the apples are not entirely soft, rub them through the col- 
ander before adding them to the boiling sirup. 

Quince Marmalade. — Take very ripe quinces ; wash, pare 
and core them ; to each pound of fruit allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the parings and cores together, with water 
enough to cover them, till quite soft ; strain the liquid into 
the preserving-kettle with the fruit and sugar. Boil the 
whole over a slow fire, stirring frequently until the mass be- 
comes thick. 

Pear and Qnince Marmalade, — Pare and core two dozen 
juicy pears and ten fine, ripe quinces. Add three-quarters 



212 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit and the juice of 
three lemons. Throw them into cold water, and stew the 
parings and cores in a little water to make the sirup. When 
they have boiled to pieces, strain off the liquid ; when cold, 
put in the sliced fruit and bring to a fast boil. When the 
mass is thick and smooth, cook steadily for an hour or more, 
working with a wooden spoon to a rich jelly. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — Take ripe, juicy pineapples ; pare, 
cut out the specks very carefully, and grate on a coarse 
grater all but the core. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Cook from twenty minutes to half an 
hour. 

Orange Marmalade. — Take eighteen sweet, ripe oranges, six 
pounds best white sugar. Grate the peel from four of these 
and reserve it for the marmalade. The rinds of the others 
will not be needed. Pare the fruit carefully, removing the 
inner white skin as well as the yellow. Slice the orange ; 
remove the seeds ; put the fruit and grated peel in a porce- 
lain kettle, and boil steadily until the pulp is reduced to a 
smooth mass. Take from the fire, and put through a col- 
ander^ Stir in six pounds of the best white sugar ; return 
to the fire, and boil fast, stirring constantly half an hour or 
until thick. 

Grape Marmalade. — Put green grapes into a preserving-pan 
with sufficient water to cover them. Put them on the fire, 
and boil until reduced to a mash ; put the pulp through a 
sieve which will strain out the seeds ; to each pound of pulp 
add two pounds of the best loaf sugar, and boil to the con- 
sistence of a jelly. 

Peach Marmalade. — Select peaches which are quite ripe ; 
pare and cut them in small pieces ; to every pound of fruit 
add one pound of sugar ; put the fruit and sugar into a pre- 
serving-kettle, and mash well together ; place it over the fire, 
and when it begins to boil, stir until it becomes quite thick.

Cherry Jam. — First stone and then weigh some freshly- 
gathered preserving cherries; boil them over a brisk fire 
for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the 
bottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to 
stick and bum. Add for each pound of the fruit half a 
pound of good sugar roughly powdered, and boil quickly 
for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. 

Blackberry Jam. — To four bowls of blackberries add four 
bowls of sugar ; boil until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jam. — Mash the raspberries, and allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil twenty minutes. A few 
currants added to raspberry jam is considered by many a 
great improvement. 

Barberry Jam. — The barberries should be quite ripe, though 
they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to 
decay. Strip them from the stalks, throw aside such as are 
spotted, and for each pound of fruit allow eighteen ounces of 
well-refined sugar ; boil this, with one pint of water to every 
four pounds, until it becomes white and falls in thick 
masses from the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it 
stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only ; take off the 
scum, and pour it into jars or glasses. 

Strawberry Jam. — ^Use fine, scarlet berries ; weigh and boil 
them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them constantly 
stirred ; add eight ounces of good sugar to the pound of 
fruit ; mix them well off the fire, then boil again quickly for 
twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice 
added at the outset to four of the strawberries will greatly 
improve this preserve. 

White Ciirrant Jam. — Boil together quickly for seven min- 
utes equal quantities of fine white currants, picked very care- 
fully, and of the best white sugar pounded and passed 
through a sieve. Stir the preserve gently the whole time, 



214 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

and skim it thoroughly. Just before it is taken from the 
fire, throw in the strained juice of one good lemon to four 
pounds of the fruit. 

Damson Jam. — The fruit for this jam should be freshly 
gathered and quite ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it 
quickly for forty minutes ; then stir in half its weight ' of 
good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, 
give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping 
it stirred and thoroughly skimmed. 

Green Gage Jam. — Rub ripe green gages through a sieve ; put 
all the pulp into a pan with an equal weight of loaf sugar 
pounded and sifted. Boil the whole until sufficiently thick, 
and put into glasses. 

Preserved Peactes. — Weigh the peaches, and allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Throw 
about half the sugar over the fruit, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning drain the sirup off the fruit, add the 
rest of the sugar, and let that come to a boil. Put the 
peaches in, and let them boil untij you can stick a straw 
through them. In cooking the peaches, put a few at a time 
only in the sirup to cook. 

Preserved Peaches, No. 2. — Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted and allow a pound of sugar to every 
pound of peaches. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle, and 
make the sirup; let it just boil ; lay the peaches in, and let 
them boil steadily until they are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated skimmer and lay upon flat 
dishes, crowding as little as possible. Boil the sirup almost 
to a jelly, until it is clear and thick, skimming off all the 
scum. Fill the jars two-thirds full of the peaches, pour on 
the boiling sirup, and, when cold, cover with brandied 
tissue-paper, then with thick paper tied tightly over them. 
Or put them in air-tight jars. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 215 

Preserved Quinces, — ^Use a pound of sugar to each pound 
of quince after paring, coring, and quartering ; take half of 
the sugar and make a thin sirup ; stew in this a few of the 
quinces at a time till all are finished. Make a rich sirup of 
the remaining sugar, and pour over them. 

Pineapple Preserves. — Use pineapples as ripe as can be had. 
Pare and cut them into thin slices, weigh them, and allow 
one pound of the best granulated sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Take a deep china bowl or dish, and in it put a layer 
of fruit and sugar alternately, a coating of sugar on the top; 
let it stand all night. In the morning, take out the fruit and 
put the sirup into a preserving-kettle. Boil and skim it until 
it is perfectly clear ; then, while it is boiling hot, pour it 
over the fruit, and let it stand uncovered until it becomes 
entirely cold. If it stands covered, the steam will fall into 
the sirup and thin it. 

Preserved Pears. — Preserved pears are put up p'recisely as 
are peaches, but are only pared, not cored or divided. "Leave 
the stems on. 

Watermelon Rind Preserves. — Select rind which is firm, 
green, and thick ; cut in any fanciful shape, such as leaves, 
stars, diamonds, etc. Then weigh, and to each pound of 
rind allow one and a half pounds of loaf sugar. To green 
them, take a brass or copper kettle, and to a layer of grape- 
vims leaves, which should be well washed, add a layer of 
the rind, and so on until the last, which should be a thick 
layer of the leaves, and well covered with a coarse linen 
cloth. To each pound of the rind, add a piece of alum the 
size of a pea ; then fill up with warm water sufficient to 
cover the whole, and let it stand upon the stove, where it 
v/ill steam, but not boil, until the greening is completed, 
which will be in two or three hours. When green, lay them 
in clear, cold water, and make your sirup. To each pound- 
of sugar add one and a half pints of water ; clarify, put in 



216 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

your rind ; slice lemons, two to each pound of rind, and 
when about half done add the lemons. Boil until the rind 
is perfectly transparent. A few pieces of ginger-root may 
be added, which will impart a high flavor, and will blend 
very delightfully with the lemons. 

Preserved Citron. — Proceed the same as above, substituting 
citron for the watermelon rind. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Procure fresh, large strawberries 
when in their prime, but not so ripe as to be very soft ; hull 
and weigh them ; take an equal weight of sugar, make a 
sirup, and when boiling hot, put in the berries. A small 
quantity only should be done at once. If crowded, they 
will become mashed. Let them boil about twenty minutes, 
or a half an hour ; turn into tumblers or small jars, and seal 
with egg papers while hot. 

Preserved Cherries. — Wash, stem, and stone the cherries ; 
save every drop of the juice, and use it in place of water in 
making the sirup. Make a sirup, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit ; add the fruit, and let 'it simmer 
gently for half an hour, skimming as is necessary. 

Damson Preserves. — To four pounds of damsons use three 
pounds of sugar ; prick each damson with a needle ; dis- 
solve the sugar with one-half pint of water, and put it on 
the fire ; when it simmers, put in as many damsons as will 
lie on the top ; when they open, take them out and lay them 
on a dish, and put others in, and so on until all have been 
in ; then put them all in the kettle together and let them 
stew until done ; put them in jars and seal them. 

Green Gage Preserves. — When the fruit is ripe, wipe them 
clean, and to one pound of fruit put one-quarter pound of 
sugar, which will make a fine sirup ; boil the fruit in this 
■sirup until it is perfectly done ; then use a fresh sirup of one 
pound of fruit to one pound of sugar; moistening the sugar 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 217 

with water. When the sirup boils put in the fruit, and leave 
for fifteen minutes ; then put the fruit in jars ; boil the sirup 
until thick ; when cooled to milkwarm, pour it over the 
fruit; tie the jars tightly and keep in a warm place. 

Strawberries in Wine. — Put a quantity of the finest large 
strawberries in a bottle, strew in a few spoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and fill the bottie up with Madeira or Sherry 
wine. 

Grapes in Brandy. — Take some close bunches of grapes, 
white or black, not overripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a 
good quantity of pounded white candy upon them, and fill 
up the jar with brandy. Tie them close down, and keep in 
a dry place. Prick each grape with a needle three times. 

Brandy Peaches. — Take large, juicy freestone peaches, not 
so ripe as to burst or mash on being handled. Rub the 
down from them with a clean thick flannel. Prick every 
peach down to the stone with a large silver fork, and score 
them all along the seam or cleft. To each pound of peaches 
allow a pound of granulated sugar and half a pint of water 
mixed with half a white of egg, slightly beaten. Put the 
sugar into a porcelain kettle and pour the water upon it. 
When it is quite melted, give it a stirring, set it over the 
fire, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then 
put in the peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) in the 
sirup till a straw will penetrate them. Then take the kettle 
off the fire, and take out the fruit with a wooden spoon, 
draining it over the kettle. Let the sirup remain in the ket- 
tle a little longer. Mix a pint of the very best white brandy 
for each pound of peaches, with the sirup, and boil them 
together ten minutes or more. Transfer the peaches to 
large glass jars, making each about two-thirds full, and 
pour the brandy and sirup over them, filling the jars full 
When cool, cover closely. 

Spiced Peaches. — Seven pounds of fruit, one pint vinegar, 



218 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

three pounds sugar, two ounces cinnamon, one-half ounce 
cloves. Scald together the sugar, vinegar, and spices ; pour 
over the fruit. Let it stand twenty-four hours ; drain off, 
scald again, and pour over fruit, letting it stand another 
twenty-four hours. Boil all together until the fruit is tender. 
Skim it out, and boil the liquor until thickened. Pour over 
the fruit and set away in a jar. 

Apple Butter. — Boil down a kettieful of cider to two- 
thirds the original quantity. Pare, core, and slice juicy 
apples, and put as many into the cider as it will cover. Boil 
slowly, stirring often with a flat stick, and when the apples 
are tender to breaking, take them out with a perforated 
skimmer, draining well against the sides of the kettle. Put 
in a second supply of apples and stew them soft, as many 
as the cider will hold. Take from the fire, pour all together 
into a tub or large crock; cover and let it stand twelve 
hours. Then return to the kettle and boil down, stirring all 
the while until it is the consistency of thick custard and 
brown in color. Spice well with Durkee's ground mixed 
spices. 

Peaci Butter. — To one bushel of peaches allow from eight 
to ten pounds of granulated sugar; pare and halve the 
peaches, put into the kettle, and stir constantly, to prevent 
sticking to the kettle, until perfectly smooth and rather 
thick ; a part of the peach-stones thrown in and cooked 
with the peaches give it a nice flavor, and they can be after- 
ward skimmed out ; add the sugar a short time before tak- 
ing from the fire ; put in jars and cover tight; peaches for 
butter should be neither too mealy nor too juicy.

widespread use of canned goods; philosophy of canning 
fruits; how to fill the jars; what jars are best; selec- 
tion OF the fruit ; where to store the cans ; need of 
watching the cans, twelve recipes of canning fruit 

AND vegetables. 

CANNED fruits and vegetables of all kinds may now be 
found abundantly in the stores. Their prices are so 
low that they present a strong inducement to the 
housekeeper to omit the labor incident to home canning, and 
simply to purchase what is needed. 

What is aimed at in all these processes is the entire ex- 
clusion of air from the fruit. Its expulsion from them is 
effected by using heat enough to cook them, after which the 
hermetical sealing does the remaining service. Solder, wax, 
and rubber bands do this sealing work. 

If it is desired to preserve the fruit whole, it may be put 
into the j'ars before heating. Fill the jars with water, and 
set them into a wash-boiler of cold water, the water reach- 
ing three-fourths of the way to the tops of the jars. Do not 
set them directly on the bottom, but on a little hay, lest the 
heat cause them to crack. Bring the water slowly to aboil, 
and let it boil about five minutes. The cans may then be 
taken out, stirred lightly, or shaken, to expel any remaining 
air bubbles ; then fill to the brim with boiling water and 
close the jars. No air bubbles should remain in the can. 
If the fruit can be cooked j^efore canning, the process is 
much simpler, as the boiling material itself expels the air. 
The cans in this case need simply to be filled and then 

sealed. 

219 



220 THE -HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

While filling jars, be careful that no current of cold ait 
strike them, as this would suffice to crack a glass jar. When 
a jar has cracked, it is hardly safe to use its contents, as 
fragments of glass may be contained in the fruit, which 
would be fatal if swallowed. 

Cans should be of glass or stoneware, as the acids of 
fruit act chemically on tin or other metals, often destroying 
the flavor of the fruit, and sometimes rendering it absolutely 
unwholesome. Do not use a metal spoon even. Either self- 
sealing cans, or those which require wax, may be used suc- 
cessfully, but probably the former are best for those of little 
experience, and they are unquestionably more convenient. 
There are several varieties of self-sealing cans, all of them 
highly recommended, and doubtless all of them sufficiently 
good. The " Valve Jar," the " Mason," and the " Hero " 
are among the best known and rnost reliable. 

Fruit should be selected with the greatest care. Some 
varieties cannot be preserved at all, unless canned when per- 
fectly fresh, and success is more certain with all kinds in 
proportion to freshness and soundness. The fruit should be 
nearly or quite ripe, but not over-ripe, and all which bears 
signs of decay should be rejected. 

In canning, as in preserving, granulated sugar should 
always be used, and also a porcelain-lined kettle. Peaches, 
pears, or other large fruit may, by the aid of a fork, be 
tastily arranged in the jars, piece by piece. The boiling 
juice may be added afterward to cover them. Thus ar- 
ranged they appear prettier in the jars, though, of course, 
the flavor is not improved. 

All canning work should be done expeditiously, and the 
cans be set away to cool. They should be kept in a cool, 
dark place and closely watched" for a few days, to see that 
the sealing is perfect. If the fruit shows signs of not being 
perfectly sealed, it should be at once taken out, scalded, and 
•sealed again. 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 221 

RECIPES. 

Canned Strawberries. — Fill glass jars with fresh strawberries 
sprinkled with sugar, allowing a little over one-quarter of a 
pound of sugar to each pound of berries ; set the jars in a 
boiler, with a little hay laid in the bottom to prevent the 
jars from breaking ; fill with cold water to within an inch or 
two of the tops of the jars ; let them i5<?;7 fifteen minutes, then 
move back to the boiler, wrap the hand in a towel, and take 
out the jars ; fill the jars to the top before sealing, using one 
or more of the filled jars for that purpose if necessary. 

Canned Gooseberries. — Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked 
bottles with gooseberries gathered the same day and before 
they have attained their full growth. Cork them tightly, 
wrap a little hay round each of them, and set them up to 
their necks in a kettle of cold water, which should be 
brought very gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently 
simmered until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; 
then take out the bottles, aind with the contents of one or 
two fill up the remainder. Use great care not to break the 
fruit in doing this. When all are ready, pour scalding 
water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely 
with it, or they will become moldy at the top. Cork the 
bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted 
resin ; keep them in a cool place ; and when they are used 
pour off the greater part of the water and add sugar as for 
the fresh fruit. 

Canned Peaches. — Peel and quarter choice peaches. Tcj 
peel, place them in a wire basket, dip into boiling water a 
moment and then into cold water, and strip off the skins. 
Have a porcelain-kettle with boiling water and another with 
sirup made with granulated sugar ; drop the peaches into 
boiling water (some previously boil the pits in the water for 
their flavor) and let them cook until tender; then lift them 
out carefully into a can, pouring over them all the sirup the 



222 THE HOUSEWIFE- S LIBKARY. 

can will hold, and seal immediately. Cook only peaches 
enough to fill one can at a time. 

Canned Peaches, No. 2. — Pare and stone peaches enough for 
two jars at a time. If many are pared, they will become dark 
colored by standing. Rinse in cold' water ; then cook in a 
rich sirup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty minutes, 
or until they are clear. Put into jars all that are not broken; 
fill up with the hot sirup, about as thick as ordinary mo- 
lasses, and seal. The same sirup will do to cook several jars. 
After the sirup becomes dark, it, with the broken peaches, 
can be used for marmalade or peach butter. The same 
method can be used for pears, plums, and all light fruits. 

Canned Pineapple. — Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit. Pick the pineapple to pieces with a 
silver fork. Scald and can while hot. 

Canned Grapes. — Squeeze the pulp from the skin ; boil the 
pulp until the seeds begin to loosen, having the skins boiling 
hard and separately in a little water. When the pulp seems 
tender, put it through the sieve ; then add the skins, if ten- 
der, with the water they boil in, if not too much. Use a 
large coffeecupful of sugar for a quart can ; boil until thick, 
and can in the usual way. 

Canned Plums. — Prick each plum with a needle to prevent 
bursting ; prepare a sirup, allowing a gill of pure water and 
a quarter of a pound of sugar to every three quarts of fruit. 
When the sugar is dissolved and the water blood-warm, put 
in the plums. Heat slowly to a boil. Let them boil five 
minutes — not fast or they will break badly — fill up the jars 
with plums, pour in the scalding sirup until it runs down 
the sides, and seal. Green gages are very fine put up in this 
way, also damsons for pies. 

Canned Pears. — Select finely flavored fruit ; either halve and 
core them or core whole ; make a sirup of sugar and water, 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 223 

using as little water as will dissolve the sugar. Add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Place the 
fruit in the kettle carefully, and let it come to a boil or until 
the fruit is well scalded. Turn into the jars hot, and seal at 
once. 

Calmed Tomatoes. — Pour boiling water over the tomatoes 
to loosen the skins. Remove these ; drain off all the juice 
tliat will come away without pressing hard ; put them into a 
kettle and heat slowly to a boil. The tomatoes will look 
much nicer if all the hard parts be removed before putting 
them on the fire. Rub the pulp soft with your hands. Boil 
half an hour ; dip out the surplus liquid, pour the tomatoes, 
boiling hot, into the cans, and seal. Keep in a cool, dark 
place. 

Camied Beasis. — Remove the strings at the sides, and cut 
into pieces about an inch long ; put them into boiling water 
and scald, then can them. 

Canned Asparagus. — Cut away all the hard part of the stem 
and boil the top portion until nearly done, just as if about 
to serve at once. Flat cans are best, into which the stems 
can be laid regularly, the water in which they were boiled 
being poured over them boiling hot, and the can sealed. If 
jars or high cans are used, pack the asparagus into them 
until they are full. Fill the cans with water ; set them on 
hay in a boiler of cold water reaching to within an inch of 
their tops ; then bring to a boil and nearly finish cooking 
the stems. Wrap the hand in a towel ; take out the cans 
and seal or solder them as in other vegetables. 

Canned Com. — Boil sweet corn till nearly done ; cut close 
from the cobs and fill the jars ; pour on water in which the 
corn was boiled ; place in a boiler and just bring to a boil, 
as above ; then take out and seal.

PICKLES MORE POPULAR THAN WHOLESOME ; GREENING PICKLES ) 
WHAT KETTLES AND JARS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PICKLING ; 
CHOOSING THE FRUIT, SPICES, ETC. ; HOW TO KEEP PICKLES ; 
CATSUPS, HOW MADE, ETC. THIRTY-THREE RECIPES FO^ PICKLES 
AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES are very popular as a relish, but it must be 
confessed that they are not the most wholesome diet 
This is due chiefly to the fact that they are made ot 
hard, crude, and often of unripe fruit. Then, too, the ex- 
cess of acid and the high seasoning disagree with many 
constitutions. 

It is deemed important that pickles for the market be 
well greened. To accomplish this end, copperas and other 
chemicals are employed or copper kettles are used. All 
this is poisonous, and should be shunned. No metal ket- 
tles or spoons should be tolerated in pickling. Glazed jars 
are not desirable either, as salt and vinegar decompose the 
glazing and set free the lead which it contains. An ordinary 
stone jar is the vessel to use, or a porcelain-lined kettle. 

Be careful to select perfectly sound fruit or vegetables for 
pickling, and use none but the very best cider vinegar. 
Good white wine vinegar does well for some sorts of pickles, 
but be ever watchful against chemical preparations called 
vinegar, that destroy instead of preserving the articles put 
away in them. In the selection of spices there is so much 
diversity of taste that no general directions will be of prac- 
tical value. But get the purest articles you can find. 

Pickles must be kept from the air. It is a good plan to 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS, 225 

put them up in large jars, and for use to empty the large 
jar at once into smaller ones, using these one at a time. 
Keep them wholly covered with the vinegar. Water will 
soon cause the jar of pickles to spoil. 

The same hints given above apply to the making of cat- 
sup, which is really but a pickle cooked to a more advanced 
point. It needs to be tightly corked and sealed, that it may 
keep well. 

RECIPES. 

Cucmnber Pickles. — Make a weak brine, hot or cold ; if hot, 
let the cucumbers stand in it twenty-four hours ; if cold, 
forty-eight hours ; rinse and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, 
take vinegar enough to cover them, allow one ounce of 
alum to every gallon of vinegar, put it in a brass kettle (or 
porcelain-lined, if the greening is not desired) with the 
cucumbers, and heat slowly, turning the cucumbers from 
the bottom frequently ; as soon as they are heated througli, 
skim them out into a crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it 
over the pickles, and let them stand at least twenty-four 
hours ; drain off the vinegar. Take fresh vinegar, and to 
every gallon allow two tablespoofuls of white nmstard-seed, 
one of cloves, one of celery-seed, one of stick cinnamon, 
one large, green pepper, a very little horse-radish, and, if 
you like, one-half pint of sugar. Divide the spices equally 
into several small bags of coarse muslin, scald with the vine- 
gar, and pour over the pickles. If you like your pickles 
hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring over them. 

CucTunber Pickles, No. 2. — To a gallon of water add a quart 
of salt, put in the cucumbers, and let them stand over night. 
In the morsing, wash them out of the brine, and put them 
carefully into a stone jar. Boil a gallon of vinegar, put in, 
while cold, quarter of a pound of cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of alum ; when it boils hard, skim it well and turn over 
the cucumbers. In a week they will be fit for use. 



226 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Pickled Onions. — Select small white onions, put them over 
the fire in cold water with a handful of salt. When the 
water becomes scalding hot, take them out and peel off the 
skins, lay them in a cloth to dry; then put them in a jar. 
Boil half an ounce of allspice and half an ounce of cloves 
in a quart of vinegar. Take out the spice and pour the 
vinegar over the onions while it is hot. Tie up the jar when 
the vinegar is cold, and keep it in a dry place. 

Pickled Onions, No. 2. — Take small, white onions and peel 
them ; lay them in salt water for two days ; change the water 
once; then drain and put them in bottles. Take vinegar 
enough to cover them, spice with whole mixed spices, scald 
it, and pour over the onions. 

Pickled GaxUc and Eschalots. — Garlic and eschalots may be 
pickled in the same way as onions. 

Pickled Nasturtiums. — Nasturtiums should be gathered 
quite young, and a portion of the buds, when very small, 
should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by dissolv- 
ing an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, 
and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to 
day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by 
some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for 
pickling, put them at once into a jar and cover them well 
with the vinegar. 

Pickled Watermelon. — Take the outer part of the rind of 
the melon, pare and cut in small pieces. To one quart of 
vinegar add two pounds of sugar, one ounce of cassia buds. 
In this boil the rind until clear and tender. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Walnuts for this pickle must be gathered 
while a pin can pierce them easily. When once the .shell 
can be felt, they have ceased to be in a proper state for it. 
Make sufificieni- brine to cover them well, with six ounces of 
salt to the gallon of water ; take off the scum, which will 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 227 

rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the walnuts, 
and stir them night and morning ; change the brine every 
three days, and if they are wanted for immediate eating, 
leave them in it for twelve days ; otherwise, drain them 
from it in nine, spread them on dishes, and let them remain 
exposed to the air until they become black ; this will be in 
twelve hours, or less. Make a pickle for them with some- 
thing more than half a gallon of vinegar to the hundred, a 
teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three of 
bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to 
half an ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck into 
three or four small onions), and four ounces of mustard- 
seed. Boil the whole of these together for about five min- 
utes ; have the walnuts ready in a stone jar, or jars, and 
pour the vinegar on them as soon as it is taken from the fire. 
When the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely and 
store it in a dry place. Keep the walnuts always well 
covered with vinegar, and boil that which is added to them. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice the red cabbage into a colan- 
der, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain two days, 
then put it into a jar and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put in a few slices of red beet-root. Use the 
purple red cabbage. Cauliflower cut in bunches, and 
thrown in after being salted, will take on the color of a 
beautiful red. 

Pickled Mushropins. — Rub the mushroom heads with flan- 
nel and salt, throw them in a stewpan with a little salt over 
them ; sprinkle with pepper and a small quantity of mace ; 
as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them 
over a gentle fire until all the liquor is dried into them 
again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover 
them ; give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Pickled Beets. — Wash the beet perfectly, not cutting any 
of the fibrous roots, lest the jurce escape; put in sufficient 



228 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

water to boil it, and when the skin will come off easily it is 
sufficiently cooked, and may be taken out and laid upon a 
cloth to cool. Having rubbed off the peel, cut the beet 
into thick slices, pour over it cold vinegar prepared as fol- 
lows : Boil a quart of vinegar with an ounce of whole black 
pepper and an equal weight of dry ginger, and let it stand 
until quite cold. Keep closely corked. 

PicMed Peppers. — Do not pick them till just as they begin 
to turn red ; then soak them for ten or twelve days in strong 
salt and water ; take them from the brine and soak them 
in clear water for a day. Wipe them dry,, and put them 
away, in cold vinegar ; or if you wish them milder, remove 
the seeds and scald the vinegar, but do not boil. 

Pickled Bell Peppers. — Cut a slit in the side of each pepper 
and take out all the seeds. Let them soak in brine (strong 
enough to float an egg) two days. Then, washing them in 
cold water, put them into a stonejar. Pour over them vine- 
gar boiled with cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Whenever 
they are wanted to be served, stuff each one with a boiled 
tongue cut into dice and mixed with a mayonnaise dressing. 
Or little mangoes may be made, stuffing each one with 
pickled nasturtiums, grapes, minced onions, red cabbage, or 
cucumbers, seasoned with mustard-seed, root ginger, and 
mace. 

Pepper-hasL — Take four dozen peppers, two very large 
cabbages, one ounce of light mustard-seed. Chop the 
peppers fine, cut the cabbage on a cabbage-knife, mix to- 
gether, salt well; and let it stand over night, putting the 
dish or tub so the juice will run down ; pour off in the 
morning. Add one ounce of cloves, one ounce of allspice ; 
mix all through, and put the vinegar on cold. 

Flint Pickles. — Make a brine of a gallon of water and a 
cupful of salt. This must be poured boiling hot on the cu- 
cumbers six days in succession. Rinse them in cold water; 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 229 

put them in a kettle with a teaspoonful of allspice and a tea- 
spoonful of cloves, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a little 
sliced horse-radish, and cider vinegar to cover them. Let 
them come to a boil, then take out and put in jars. 

East India Pickle. — One hundred cucumbers (large and 
small), one peck of green tomatoes, one-half peck of onions, 
four cauliflowers, four red peppers (without the seeds), four 
heads of celery, one pint of bottled horse-radish. Slice all, 
and stand in salt twenty-four hours, then drain ; pour on 
weak vinegar ; stand on stove until it comes to a boil ; then 
drain again. Take one ounce of ground cinnamon, .one 
ounce of ground tumeric, one-half pound of mustard, one- 
quarter pound of brown sugar; wet these with cold vinegar; 
add to this sufficient vinegar to moisten all the pickles. 
Cook all together ten minutes. Seal in bottles while hot. 

Frencll Pickle. — Take one peck of green tomatoes, sliced ; 
six large onions. Throw on them a teacupfulof salt over night. 
Drain thoroughly, then boil in two quarts of water and one 
quart of vinegar fifteen or twenty minutes; drain in colan- 
der ; then take four quarts of vinegar, two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-half pound of white mustard-seed, two table- 
spoonfuls of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two 
tablespoonfuls of ginger, two tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard, *one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper ; put all to- 
gether and cook fifteen minutes. 

PiccaUily. — One peck of green tomatoes sliced, one-half 
peck of onions sliced, one cauliflower, one peck of small cu- 
cumbers. Leave in salt and water twenty-four hours ; then 
put in a kettle with a handful of scraped horse-radish, one 
ounce of tumeric, one ounce of whole cloves, one-quarter 
pound of whole pepper, one ounce of cassia buds or cinna- 
mon, one pound of white mustard-seed, one pound of Eng- 
lish mustard. Put in kettle in layers, and cover with cold 
vinegar. Boil fifteen minutes, constantly stirring.

ful of salt, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of red pepper. Boil 
till thick ; then bottle and seal tightly. 

Walnut Catsup. — The vinegar in which walnuts have been 
pickled, when they have remained in it a year, will generally 
answer all the purposes for which this catsup is required, 
particularly if it be drained from them and boiled for a few 
minutes, with a little additional spice and a few eschalots •, 
but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made by

boiling either the expressed juice of young walnuts for an 
hour, with six ounces of fine anchovies, four ounces of 
eschalots, half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter ounce of 
cloves, and a drachm of mace to every quart. 

Walnut Catsup, No. 2. — Pound in a mortar a hundred young 
walnuts, strewing among them as they are done half a 
pound of salt; then pour to them a quart of strong vinegar 
and let them stand until they have become quite black, 
keeping them stirred three or four times a day ; next add a 
quart of strong, old beer, and boil the whole together for ten 
minutes ; strain it, and let it remain until the next day ; then 
pour it off clear from the sediment, add to it one large head 
of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the same 
quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of 
mace ; boil these togethej for half an hour, and the follow- 
ing day bottle and cork the catsup well. 

A bottle of port wine may be added before bottling, if de- 
sired, and a large bunch of sweet herbs. 

Oystev Catsup. — Take fine, large fresh oysters, opened care- 
fully, and v/ash them in their own liquor. To take any par- 
ticle of shell that may remain, strain the liquor after. Pound 
the oysters in a mortar, add the liquor, and to every pint 
put a pint of sherry ; boil it up and skim ; then add two 
anchovies, pounded, an ounce of common salt, two drachms 
of pounded mace, and one of cayenne. Let it boil up, then 
skim, and rub it through a sieve. Bottle when cold and 
seal it. What remains in the sieve will do for oyster sauce.

ful salt, one tablespoonful cayenne pepper, one tablespoonful 
mace, one teacupful cider vinegar, one teacupful sherry. 
Chop the oysters, and boil in their own liquor with the tea^ 
cupful of vinegar, skimming the skum as it rises. Boil three 
minutes, strain through a hair cloth, return the liquor to the

fire ; add the wine, pepper, salt, and mace. Boil fifteen 
minutes, and when cold, bottle for use. 

Mushroom Catsup with Spice. — Take full-grown and fresh- 
gathered mushrooms ; put a layer of these at the bottom of 
a deep Ccirthen pan and sprinkle them with salt ; then another 
layer of mushrooms ; sprinkle more salt on them, and so on 
alternately. Let them stand for two or three hours, by 
which time the salt will have penetrated the mushrooms and 
have made them easy to break ; then pound them in a mor- 
tar, or break them well with your hands ; let them remain 
in this state for two days, not more, washing them well once 
or twice a day ; then pour them into a stone jar, and to each 
quart add an ounce and a half of whole black pepper and 
half an ounce of allspice ; stop the Jar very close, and set it 
in a saucepan of boiling water and keep it boiling for two 
hours at least. Take out the jar and pour the juice clear 
from the settlings through a hair sieve into a clean stewpan, 
and boil it very gently on a slow fire for half an hour. 

Mushroom Catsup without Spice. — Sprinkle a little salt over 
your mushrooms. Three hours after, mash them ; next day, 
strain off the liquor and boil it till it is reduced to half. It 
will not keep long, but an artificial mushroom bed will 
supply this, the very best mushroom catsup, all the year 
round.

RECIPES FOR BEVERAGES. 



ASIDE from the spirituous and malt liquors, the composi- 
tion of which is not attempted in the household, there 
is a long line of beverages concerning which some 
hints are of value. In general, it may be said, employ good 
materials, and do not stint them in quantity, if you want 
good results. What is worth doing at all in culinary lines 
is worth doing well, and beverages, being in the line of lux- 
uries, should be good, if not positively luxuriant. 

Tea is the leaf of the tea-tree cured in various ways, and 
so appearing in the various forms known to commerce. 
Black teas are subjected to the action of heat far beyond the 
green teas. The green teas go through a greening process 
also, the healthfulness of which may well be questioned. 

Of the black teas, the Pekoe is the earliest gathered and 
mildest, while the Souchong, the Congou, and the Bohea 
are respectively older in growth and stronger in flavor. 

Of the green teas, the Young Hyson is from the tenderest 
and mildest leaf, the Gunpowder, Hyson, and Twankay 
being of older growth respectively and of stronger flavor. 
The treatment of all these leaves, as well as their age, are 
important fa'tetors in their final quality. 



BEVERAGES. 235 

The nutritive vJue of tea is not appreciable, but as an ex- 
citant of respiratory action and a promoter of digestion it is 
very valuable. Tea should be kept closely covered in air- 
tight canisters, in order that the flavor may be retained. 

Coffee will grow in any climate where the temperature 
does not fall below fifty-five degrees. The best brands are 
the Mocha and the Java, but South America supplies the 
- largest amount used in this country, which is sold under the 
general name of Rio. Coffee is often wretchedly adulterated, 
especially when sold in the roasted and ground form. It is 
safer to buy it green and to roast and grind it at home. 

Roasted coffee should be kept in tight canisters or boxes, 
and it should be ground only as it is wanted for use. The 
coffeepot must be scalded clean and occasionally with soda, 
so that the inside may be absolutely pure. 

Chocolate should never be made except it is intended to 
be used immediately. By allowing it to become cold or 
by boiling it again, the flavor is injured, the oily particles of 
the cocoa are separated and rise to the surface also, and they 
will never blend pleasantly again. 

Other beverages are in occasional use, but those already 
mentioned are the standards in this land. 



RECIPES. 

Tea. — People must consult their own tastes as to the kind 
of tea. A mixed tea is generally preferred, combining the 
flavors of both green and black. Allow one teaspoonful 
for each person. Use boiling water, but do not boil the tea, 
and use while fresh. Tea is best made in an earthen teaoot. 
It should never be made in tin. 

Iced Tea,-^Iced tea should be made several hours before it 
is needed and then set upon ice. When ready to use it, 
sweeten and drink without milk or cream. Use cracked ice 



236 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

to put into the glass. The tea must be extra strong, and do 
not stint the ice. 

Tea a la Russe. — Slice fresh, juicy lemons; pare them 
carefully, lay a piece in the bottom of each cup ; sprinkle 
with white sugar and pour the tea, very hot and strong, 
over them. 

Iced Tea a la Russe. — To each goblet of cold tea (without 
cream) add the juice of half a lemon. Fill up with 
pounded ice and sweeten well. A glass of champagne 
added to this makes what is called Russian punch. 

Coffee. — To make choicest coffee, take equal quantities of 
Java and Mocha ; grind finely together, allowing about two 
teaspoonfuls of ground coffee to each person ; add an &^g 
with its shell and a very little cold water; stir this thor- 
oughly together and turn on boiling water. Set the pot on 
the back of the range for five minutes 5 then draw forward 
and allow it to boil up just an instant; clear the spout by 
pouring from it and returning it in the top of the pot. Then 
serve at once with plenty of cream and sugar. 

Iced Coffee. — Make the coffee extra strong. When it is 
cold, mix with an equal quantity of fresh cream ; sweeten to 
taste, and freeze as in ice-cream, or serve with abundance of 
broken ice. 

Cafe Noir. — This is the strongest preparation of coffee, its 
very essence, indeed. It is used after dessert at course din- 
ners. Make the coffee strong and clear as possible, but use 
only one-third the ordinary quantity of water. Serve with 
lump sugar, with which it should be highly sweetened, and 
use very small cups. Cream may be added if desired. 

Meringued Coffee.— For six cupfuls of coffee take about 
one cupful of sweet cream, whipped light, with a little sugar. 
Put into each cup the desired amount of sugar and about 
a tablespoonful of boiling milk. Pour the coffee ever these. 



BEVERAGES. 237 

and lay upon the surface of the hot liquid a large spoonful 
of the frothed cream. Give a gentle stir to each cup before 
sending it from the tray. 

Prothed Cafe an Lait — Pour into the table urn one quart 
of strong, clear coffee, strained through muslin, and one 
quart of boiling milk, alternating them, and stirring gently. 
Cover and wrap a thick cloth about the urn for five minutes 
before it goes to table. Have ready in a cream-pitcher the 
whites of three eggs, beaten stiff, and one tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, whipped with them. Put a large spoonful 
of this froth upon each cupful of coffee as you pour it out, 
heaping it slightly in the centre. 

Cliocolate. — Scrape fine one square of a cake, which is one 
ounce ; add to it an equal weight of sugar ; put these into 
a pint of boiling milk and water, each one-half, and stir well 
for two or three minutes until the sugar and chocolate are 
well dissolved. This preparation may be improved by 
adding a well-beaten egg or two and stirring briskly through 
the mixture with a Dover egg-beater. A teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract added just before sending to table is a valua- 
ble addition. 

Frothed Chocolate. — One cupful of boiling water; threo 
pints of fresh milk ; three tablespoonfuls of Baker's choco- 
late, grated ; five eggs, the whites only, beaten light, and two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar for froth. Sweeten the 
chocolate to taste ; heat the milk to scalding ; wet up the 
chocolate with the boiling water, and when the milk is hot, 
stir this into it; simmer gently ten minutes, stirring fre- 
quently ; boil up briskly once ; take from the fire ; sweeten 
to taste, taking care not to make it too sweet, and stir in the 
whites of two eggs, whipped stiff, without sugar ; pour into 
the chocolate pot or pitcher, which should be well heated. 
Have ready in a cream-pitcher the remaining whites. 



238 THE HOUSE wirrs library. 

whipped up with the powdered sugar ; cover the surface of 
each cup with the sweetened meringue before distributing to 
the guests. 

Choca. — This beverage, a favorite with many, is made by- 
mixing coffee and chocolate, as prepared for the table, in 
equal quantities, and serving hot for breakfast. 

Broma. — Dissolve a large tablespoonful of Baker's broma 
in as much warm water ; then pour upon it a pint of boiling 
milk and water, in equal proportions, and boil it two min- 
utes longer, stirring it frequently ; add sugar at pleasure. 

Breakfast Cocoa. — Into a breakfast cup put a teaspoonful of 
the powder, add a tablespoonful of boiling water, and mix 
thoroughly. Then add equal parts of boiling water and 
boiled milk, and sugar to the taste. Boiling two or three 
minutes will improve it. 

Cocoa Shells. — Take a small quantity of cocoa shells (say 
two ounces), pour upon them three pints of boiling water, 
boil rapidly thirty or forty minutes ; allow it to settle 
or strain, and add cream or boiling milk and sugar at 
pleasure. 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice of lemons, and add sugar 
and ice-water to taste. 

Concentrated Lemonade. — Make a rich sirup of two and a 
half pounds of sugar and one pint of cold water and boil 
gradually. Pour it hot on one and a half ounces of citric 
acid. Bottle tight while hot. One tablespoonful will make 
a tumblerful of lemonade. 

Portable Lemonade. — Mix a quarter pound of white sugar 
with the grated rind of a large, juicy lemon. Pour upon 
this the strained juice of the lemon and pack in a jar. One 
tablespoonful will suffice for a glass of water. 

Egg Nog. — To the yelks of six eggs, add six tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, one quart of new milk, a half pint 



BEVERAGES. 239 

of French brandy, and one pint of Madeira wine. Beat the 
whites up separately, and stir them through the mixture just 
before pouring into glasses for use. 

Roman Punch. — Beat stiff the whites of three eggs, with a 
half pound of powdered sugar. Add three teacupfuls of 
strong, sweet lemonade, one wineglassful each of rum and 
champagne, and the juice of two oranges. Ice abundantly, 
or freeze. 

Milk PnncL — Boil one quart of milk, warm from the cow. 
Beat up the yelks of four eggs and four tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar together; add two glasses of the best 
sherry wine ; pour into a pitcher, and mix with it the boil- 
ing milk, stirring all the time. Pour from one vessel to 
another six times ; add cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, and 
serve as soon as it can be swallowed without scalding the 
throat. 

Currant and Raspberry Shrub. — Pound four quarts of ripe 
currants and three quarts of red raspberries in a stone jar or 
wide-mouthed crock with a wooden beetle. Squeeze out 
every drop of the juice; put this into a porcelain, enamel, 
or very clean bell-metal kettle, and boil hard ten minutes. 
Put in four pounds of loaf sugar at the end of the ten min- 
utes, and boil up once to throw the scum to the top ; skim 
and let it get perfectly cold ; then skim off all remaining 
impurities; add one quart of the best brandy and shake 
hard for five minutes. Bottle, seal the corks, and lay the 
bottles on their sides in dry sawdust. 

Currant Wine. — One quart of currant juice, three pounds 
of brown sugar, and one gallon of water; dissolve the sugar 
in the water, then add the juice ; when it ferments, add a 
little fresh water each day till it is done fermenting, which 
will be in from a month and a half to two months ; turn it 
ofif) scald the keg, put it in again, and cork tightly. 



240 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Raspberry Wine. — Bruise the raspberries with the back of 
a spoon ; strain them through a flannel bag ; add one pound 
of loaf sugar to one quart of juice; stir well and cover 
closely, letting it stand for three days, stirring well each 
day. Pour off the clear juice and add one quart of juice 
to two quarts of sherry wine ; bottle it and use in two 
weeks. 

Raspberry Brandy. — Using brandy instead of wine, as 
above, will produce a very valuable medicinal drink. Rasp- 
berry Brandy. 

Raspberry Vinegar, — Take three pints of red berries ; pour 
over them one pint of cider vinegar and let stand twenty- 
four hours. Strain, and to one pint of juice add one 
pound of sugar ; boil one^half hour, and when cold, bottle 
for use. 

Cherry Brandy. — Use either morello cherries or small black 
cherries ; pick them from the stalks ; fill the bottles nearly 
up to the necks, then fill up with brandy (some use whisky, 
gin, or spirit distilled from the lees of wine). In three 
weeks or a month strain off the spirit ; to each quart add 
one pound of loaf sugar clarified, and flavor with tincture 
of cinnamon or cloves. 

Sherbet. — In a quart of water boil six or eight sticks of 
rhubarb ten minutes ; strain the boiling liquor on the thin 
shaved rind of a lemon. Two ounces of clarified sugar, 
with a wineglassful of brandy, stir to the above, and let it 
stand five or six hours before using. 

Ginger Beer. — Two ounces of ginger to a pint of molasses ; 
add a gallon of warm water; stir it well, and add half a pint 
of lively yeast. If you wish it sweeter or hotter, add gin- 
ger or molasses before putting in the yeast, to suit your 
taste. 



BEVERAGES. 241 

Spruce Beer. — To three gallons of boiling water, add two 
pounds of molasses and two, ounces of essence of spruce. 
Let the mixture cool, and when lukewarm, add a scant gill 
of yeast and set aside to ferment. While the fermentation 
goes on, skim frequently. When it becomes inactive, put in 
stone bottles and tie the corks down. White sugar may be 
used instead of molasses, and will give a better color. 

Quick Beer, — To fourteen quarts of water add one quai;t of 
molasses, one quart of hop yeast, and four tablespoonfuls of 
ginger. Mix well ; strain through a fine sieve ; bottle im- 
mediately. Ready for use in twenty-four hours. 

LnpeiiaL — Mix in a jug one-half ounce of cream tartar 
and one quart of boiling water ; flavor with lemon peel or 
essence of lemon, and sweeten to taste. This is a refreshing 
and pleasantly stimulating summer drink. 

Mead. — Mix six gallons of water with six quarts of 
strained honey ; add the yellow rind of two large lemons, 
pared thin, and the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Mix well and boil three-quarters of an hour, skim- 
ming thoroughly. Pour into a tub, add three tablespoonfuls 
of good yeast, and leave it ferment. When it is well worked, 
pour into a barrel with some lemon peel, and let it stand six 
months. Then bottle and tie down the corks. It is ready 
for immediate use, or will keep for months in a cool place.

XIX.— CANDIES. 

CARE NEEDED TO COOK CANDY ; WHEN COOKED ENOUGH ; FLAVOR- 
ING, COOLING, AND, PULLING. TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR CANDY, 

THE great danger in candy-making is that of burning the 
sugar. To properly cook the candy requires a heat of 
about two hundred and fifty degrees. Less than that 
heat will leave the candy soft and sticky. A very little more 
than two hundred and sixty degrees will burn it. Here, 
then, is the need of care in candy-making. 

In the cooking, allow the heat to reach the bottom of the 
pan only. Have a quick fire that the work may be done in 
the shortest possible time. When cooked for about fifteen 
minutes, test a spoonful of the mass upon a cold plate. If it 
form a viscid, tenacious mass, which forms a long, adherent 
thread when drawn out, then it is nearly done, and it needs 
special care lest it burn before the work be completed. Test 
frequently now, dropping a little in cold water. When the 
hardened portion is crisp as a pipestem, the cooking has 
gone far enough. Then comes the flavoring and coloring. 

When the mass has cooled on a stone or buttered plate, 
so that it can be handled, it is ready for pulling, rolling into 
sticks, shaping into forms, etc. The pulling process is 
simply a mechanical means of whitening the candy. It is 
literally a /2///z«g-, the candy being thrown on a hook and 
pulled out from it, then being thrown on it again and again 
pulled, and so on, as maybe desired, the longer pulling giv- 
ing the whiter candy. 

For home-made candies use pure materials and good, 
fruit. Enough of earths and starch and decayed fruits are 
bought in the cheap candies of the stores.

CANDIES. 243 

RECIPES. 

Molasses Candy. — Three cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one cupful of water, one-half teaspoonful 
of cream tartar, butter the size of a walnut. Bring to a boil, 
and when crisp by testing in cold water, flavor ; pour out on 
a buttered plate, and pull to whiteness if desired. 

Butter ScotcL — Two cupfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls 
of water, a piece of butter the size of an egg. Boil without 
stirring, until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out on buttered 
plates to cool. 

Icecream Candy. — Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
half a cupful of water, and add one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cream tartar dissolved in a teaspoonful of boiling water. 
Put it in a porcelain kettle, and boil ten minutes without 
stirring it. Drop a few drops into a saucer of cold water ot 
on snow. If it become brittle, it is done ; if not, boil till it is. 
Add a piece of butter half as large as an egg while it is on 
the fire, and stir it in. Pour into a buttered tin, and set on 
ice or snow to cool enough to pull it white. Flavor with 
vanilla just before it is cool enough to pull. Work into 
strands and cut into sticks. 

Cream Candy. — One pound of white sugar, three table, 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of lemon extract, one 
teeispoonful of cream tartar. Add a little water to moisten 
the sugar, and boil until britde. Put in the extract, then 
turn quickly out on buttered plates. When cool, pull until 
white, and cut in squares. 

Cocoanut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoanut, spread 
it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, as it will 
not bear the heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when 
freshly broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound 
of sugar for most tastes, but more can be used at pleasure. 
To one pound of sugar, take one-half pint of water, a very

little white of egg, and then pour over the sugar ; let H 
stand for a short time, then place over a very clear fire, and 
let it boil for a few minutes ; then set it one side until the 
scum is subsided, clear it off, and boil the sugar until very- 
thick ; then strew in the nut, stir and mix it well, and do not 
quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable to burn 
with too fierce a heat. . 

AlmoM Candy. — Proceed Ift the same way as for cocoanut 
candy. Let the almonds be blanched and perfectly dry, and 
do not throw them into the sugar until they approach the 
candyinfflpoint. 

Candied Nuts and rruits. — Three cupfuls of sugar, one cup- 
ful of water ; boil until it hardens when dropped in water, 
then flavor with lemon. It must not boil after the lemon is 
put in. Put a nut on the end of a fine knitting needle, take 
out, and turn on the needle until it is cool. * If the candy 
gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. Malaga 
grapes, and oranges quartered, may be candied in the same 
way. * 

ChocolateiCaramels. — Two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of 
warm water, one-half cupful of grated chocolate, three- 
fourths of a Cupful of butter. Let it boil without stirring 
until it snaps in water. 

Chocolate Caramels, No. 2. — One cupful of rich, sweet cream ; 
one cupful of brown sugar ; one cupful of white sugar ; seven 
tablespoonfuls of vanilla chocolate ; one tablespoonful of 
corn-starch, stirred in the cream ; one tablespoonful of but- 
ter ; vanilla flavoring ; soda, the size of a pea, stirred into 
cream. Boil all the ingredients, except the chocolate and 
vanilla extract, half an hour, stirring to prevent burning. 
Reserve half of the cream, and' wet up the chocolate in it,«? 
adding a very little water if hecessary. Draw the saucepan 
to the side of the range, and stir this in well ; put back on 



CANDIES. 245 

the fire and boil ten minutes longer, quite fast, stirring con- 
stantly. When it makes a hard, glossy coat on the spoon, 
it is done. Add the vanilla after taking it from the range. 
Turn into shallow dishes, well buttered. When cold 
enough to retain the impression of the knife, cut into 
sg,uares. 

Lemon Ta^. — Two cupfuls of white sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, one-quarter cupful of vinegar, one-half cupful 
of butter ; flavor with lemon ; pour in buttered plates to cool. 

Butter Taffy. — One tablespoonful of vinegar, one cupful of 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, and a piece of butter 
the size of an egg. When done, add a little soda. 

Cream Chocolates. — For the creams, boil two cupfuls of 
white sugar and one-half cupful of milk for five minutes ; 
add one teaspoonful of vanilla, then beat until stiff enough 
to'handle and aiake into drops." 

For the dtocolate, take three-quarters of a half-pound cake 
of Baker's chocolate, grate and steam over the teakettle. 
Drop the creams when hard, one at a time, into the hot 
chocolate, using two forks to take them out quickly ; set 
the drop on one fork on the bottom, using the other fork to 
scrape the chocolate off the cream ; gently slip the drop 
upon a buttered dish. If, when cool, the drops stick to the 
dish, hold it over the steam of the teakettle for an instant. 

Chocolate Creams. — Inside : Two cupfuls of sugar ; one cup- 
ful of water ; one and a half tablespoonfuls of arrow-root ; 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Mix the ingredients, except the 
yanilla ; let them boil from five to eight minutes ; stir all the 
time. After this is taken from the fire, stir until it comes to 
a cream. When it is nearly smooth, add the vanilla and 
make the cream into balls. 

Outside : Melt a half pound of Baker's chocolate, but do 
not add water to it. Roll the cream balls into the chocolate 
while it is warm. 



246 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Cream Walnuts. — Two cupfuls sugar, two-thirds cupful 
water. Boil without stirring until it will spin a thread; 
flavor with vanilla. Set off into a dish with a little cold 
water in it ; stir briskly until white and creamy. Have the 
walnuts shelled ; make the cream into small, round cakes 
with your fingers ; press half a walnut on either side, and 
drop into sifted granulated sugar. 

Cream Dates. — For cream dates, take fresh California dates, 
remove the stones, and fill the centre of dates with the same 
cream as used in cream walnuts. Drop into sugar. 

Peanut Candy.^Boil one scant pint of molasses until it 
hardens in cold water. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of vanilla, 
then one teaspoonful of soda, dry. Lastly, the shelled pea- 
nuts, taken from four quarts measured before shelling; 
Turn out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down 
smooth with a wooden spoon. * 

PMladelpMa Groundnut Cakes. — Boil two pounds of light 
brown sugar in a preserving kettle, with enough water to 
wet it thoroughly and form a sirup. Have ready a quarter 
of a peck of groundnuts (peanuts). When the sugar begins 
to boil, throw in the white of an egg to clear it. Skim and 
try by dropping a little into cold water to see if brittle or 
done. When it is brittle, remove from the fire, and stir in 
the nuts. Drop on wet plates, free from grease. The white 
of egg may be omitted. 

Gum Drops. — Dissolve one pound of gum arable in one and 
a half pints of water; strain and add one pound of refined 
sugar ; beat until the sugar is entirely dissolved. Flavor to 
taste, and add coloring if desired. Then evaporate with a 
slow heat until the mass is thick as honey. Have a shallow 
box, or dish of fine starch ; in this make a series of dents * 
with a rounded stick, the size desired for the gum drops'.. 
Into each of these indentations drop from a spout, or a 



CANDIES. 247 

spoon, just enough of the thickened mass to fill the cavity, 
then set away in a warm place till the drops become suffi- 
ciently set to allow handling. This may require several 
days. 

Jujube Paste. — Dissolve gum arable, and add sugar as for 
gum drops. Evaporate till very thick, and while still warm 
flavor and pour out into shallow tin pans to cool. 

Kg Paste. — Chop up one pound of figs, and boil in a pint 
of water till reduced to a soft pulp. Strain through a fine 
sieve, and add three pounds of sugar. Evaporate over boil- 
ing water till the paste becomes stiff, then pour it into a 
mold of wooden strips tied together. When cool, cut into 
squares ; sugar each well, and put away for use. Flavors 
may be added to taste, or fresh fruits may be mingled with 
the paste. 

Peppennint Drops. — Mix granulated sugar with enough 
water to form a paste, and put it to boil in a saucepan hav- 
ing a lip from which the contents can be poured or dropped. 
Allow it come almost, but not entirely, to a boil. Stir con- 
tinually. Allow it to cool a little, and flavor to taste with 
'strong essence of peppermint. Then drop the mass on 
sheets of tin or of white paper. To drop it properly, allow 
just enough to gather at the lip of the saucepan, and then 
stroke it off with a piece of stiff wire. They should dry in 
a warm place. 



XX.— INVALID DIET. 

INVALIDS NEED THE BEST OF DIET ; WHAT INVALID DIET SHOULD 
furnish; "SICK-DIET KITCHENS;" HOME COOKING FOR THE 
SICK. THIRTY RECIPES FOR SICK-ROOM DIET. 

WHAT is more disgusting to an invalid than to be 
served with a liberal supply of food adapted to a 
laboring man or to a person in robust health ? Deli- 
cate appetites need to be delicately appealed to with dainty 
dishes, nicely served. But these dishes must be nourishing 
and easily digested. In short, the problem in sick-room 
diet is, how to furnish the patient the most valuable nutri- 
tion in the pleasantest form, and with the least tax upon his 
enfeebled powers. 

To meet this need, organized movements have been made 
in many cities in the line of" Sick-Diet Kitchens." Benevo- 
lent contributions and skilled work are the corner-stones of 
these institutions. The foods are well prepared by compe- 
tent hands. The sick who choose to purchase delicacies 
which can be relied on, can find them at these places. 
Those who are too poor to purchase, but who are deserving, 
can have them free. Instruction concerning diet for the sick 
is given also. 

But many cannot reach such establishments, and do not 
care to if they can ; hence the chapter of directions given 
below. If anywhere in cookery good materials and skillful 
manipulation are of value it is in cooking for the sick. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. 
Put into a jar without a drop of water, cover tightly, set in 

248_ 



INVALID DIET. 249 

a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue 
this steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like 
white rags and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to 
taste, and when cold, skim. The patient will often prefer 
this ice-cold. 

Beef Tea, No. 2. — Take lean, juicy beef, chopped very finely ; 
cover with cold water, and set on back of the range for two 
hours ; then draw forward, allowing it to heat gradually ; 
then boil for five minutes. Season and strain. 

Mutton Broth. — One pound of lean mutton, cut small ; one 
quart of water, cold ; one tablespoonful of rice or barley, 
soaked in a very little warm water; four tablespoonfuls 
of milk, salt and pepper, with a little chopped parsley. 
Boil the meat, unsalted, in the water, keeping it closely 
covered, until it falls to pieces. Strain it out, add the soaked 
barley or rice; simmer half an hour, stirring often; stir in 
the seasoning and the milk, and simmer five minutes after it 
heats up well, taking care itdoes not bum. Serve hot, with 
cream cra'ikers. 

Chicken Broth. — Proceed precisely as above, but substitute 
chicken for mutton. 

Chicken Jelly. — Half a raw chicken, p'ounded with a mallet, 
bones and meat together ; plenty of cold water to cover it 
well, about a quart. Heat slowly in a covered vessel, and 
let it simmer until the meat is in white rags and the liquid 
reduced one-half. Strain and press, first through a colan- 
der, then through a coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper 
if you think best; return to the fire, and simmer five min- 
utes longer. Skim when cool. Give to the patient cold — 
just from the ice — with unleavened wafers. Keep on the 
ice, or make into sandwiches by putting the jelly between 
thin slices of bread spread lightly with butter. 

Soft Boiled Eggs. — Put in a pan of boiling water, and set on 
a part of the range where they will not boil for several min- 



250 I'HE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

utes. At the end of that time they will be like jelly, pei. 
fectly soft, but beautifully done, and quite digestible by even 
weak stomachs. 

Egg GrueL — Beat the yelk of one egg with one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar ; pour one teacupful of boiling water on it ; add 
the white of the egg beaten to a froth, with any seasoning 
or spice desired. To be taken warm. 

Raw Egg. — Break a fresh egg into a glass, beat until very 
light, sweeten to taste, and add two tablespootifuls of port 
wine, then beat again. 

Egg Cream. — Beat a raw egg to a stiff froth ; add a table- 
spoonful of white sugar and a half wineglass of good black- 
berry wine ; add half a glass of cream ; beat together 
thoroughly, and use at once. 

Indian-meal GrueL — One tablespoonful of fine Indian-meal, 
mixed smooth with cold water and a saltspoonful of salt ; 
pour upon this a pint of boiling water and turn into a sauce- 
pan to boil gently for half an hour ; thin it with boiling 
water if it thickens too much, and stir frequently ; when it 
is done, a tablespoonful of cream or a little new milk may 
be put in to cool it after straining, but if the patient's stom- 
ach is weak it is best without either. Some persons like it 
sweetened and a little nutmeg added, but to many it is more 
palatable plain. 

Oatmeal Gruel — Soak a handful of oatmeal over night in 
water, in order that the acid gases which oatmeal contains 
may be withdrawn. Pour off the water, and add a pint of 
fresh; stir it well, add salt,. and boil an hour and a half. 
This is much used, prepared in this way, by dyspeptics. 

Sago. — Soak and wash it well ; add a pint of water, a little 
salt, and boil till clear. Add lemon-juice or wine, if 
permitted. 

Arrow-root Jelly. — Boil a pint of water with a few bits of 



INVALID DIET. 251 

cinnamon or yellow rind of lemon ; stir into it two table- 
spoonfuls of arrow-root, dissolved in a little water ; boil ten 
minutes ; strain, salt, and season with sugar, wine, and nut- 
meg, if proper. 

Arrow-root Brotli. — Put half a pint of water into a sauce- 
pan ; add a little lemon-juice, sugar and nutmeg, and a very 
little salt. Boil it up, and stir in a teaspoonful of dissolved 
arrow-root ; boil five minutes. It should be taken warm 
and be very thin. 

Cracked Wheat — To one quart of hot water take one small 
teacupful of cracked wheat and a little salt ; boil slowly for 
half an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Serve 
with sugar and cream or new milk. 

Cracker Panada. — Six Boston crackers, split ; two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a little 
nutmeg; enough boiling water to cover them well. Split the 
crackers, and pile in a bowl in layers, salt and sugar scat- 
tered among them. Cover with boiling water and set on 
the hearth, with a close top over the bowl, for at least an 
hour. The crackers should be almost clear and soft as jelly, 
but not broken. Eat from the bowl with more sugar 
sprinkled in. 

Bread Panada. — Set a little water on the fire in a very 
clean saucepan ; add a glass of wine, if allowed, some sugar, 
nutmeg, and lemon-peel. The moment it boils up stir in a 
few crumbs of stale baker's loaf Let it boil very fast for 
five minutes. It should be only thick enough to drink. 

Chicken Panada. — Boil a chicken ; take a few bits of the 
breast and pound fine in a mortar. Season it with a little 
salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of lemon-peel ; boil gently 
till a little thick, but so that it can be drank. 

Soft Toast. — Some invalids like this very much indeed, and 
nearly all do when it is nicely made. Toast well, but not 



252 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

too brown, a couple of thin slices of bread ; put them on a 
warm plate and pour over boiling water ; cover quickly with 
another plate of the same size, and drain the water off; re- 
move the upper plate, butter the toast, put it in the oven 
one minute, and then cover again with a hot plate and serve 
at once. 

Milk Porii^e. — Two cupfuls of best oatmeal, two cupfuls 
of water, two cupfuls of milk. Soak the oatmeal over night 
in the water; strain in the morning, and boil the water half 
an hour. Put in the milk with a little salt, boil up well, and 
serve. Eat warm, with or without powdered sugar. 

Thickened Milk. — With a little milk, mix smooth a table- 
spoonful of flour and a pinch of salt. Pour upon it a quart 
of boiling milk, and when both are thoroughly mingled put 
all back into the saucepan and boil up once, being careful 
not to burn, and stirring all the time to keep it perfectly 
smooth and free from lumps. Serve with slices of dry toast. 
It is excellent in diarrhcea, and becomes a specific by scorch- 
ing the flour before mixing with the milk. 

Toast Water. — Toast stale bread until quite brown, but- do 
not burn it ; put it into a large bowl, and pour over it boil- 
ing water ; let it stand for an hour or so, strain, and put in 
a piece of ice before drinking. 

Barley Water. — Soak one pint of barley in lukewarm water 
for a few minutes ; then drain off the water. Put the barley 
in three quarts of cold water and cook slowly until the 
barley is quite soft, skimming occasionally. This barley 
water, when cold, flavor with a little jelly or lemonade. 

Rice Milk. — Pick and wash the rice carefully ; boil it in 
water until it swells and softens ; when the water is partly 
boiled away, add some milk. It may be boiled entirely in 
milk, by setting the vessel in which the rice is in boiling 
water ; sweeten with white sugar and season with nutmeg. 
It also may be thickened with a little flour or beaten egg. 



INVALID DIET. 253 

Flaxseed Tea. — One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound 
of rock candy, and three lemons pared and sliced; pour 
over this two quarts of boiling water ; let it stand until very- 
cold ; strain before drinking. This is good for a cough. 

Appleade. — Cut two large apples in slices, and pour on 
them one pint of boiling water ; strain well and sweeten. 
Ice it before drinking. 

Apple Water. — Roast two large, tart apples until they are 
soft. Put them in a pitcher, pour a pint of cold water on 
them, and let them stand in a cool place for an hour. No 
sweetening is needed. This drink will be found very 
refreshing if the patient have fever or eruptive diseases. 

Roast Apples. — Good-sized, juicy, tart apples are best for 
roasting. Wipe them clean, and put in a slow oven, allow- 
ing an hour for the work of roasting. When entirely done, ' 
sift fine, white sugar over them, and serve warm or cold, as 
desired. 

Wine Whey. — Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when 
boiling throw in two wineglassfuls of sherry ; when the curd 
forms, strain the whey through a muslin bag into tumblers 

Blackberry Simp. — One quart of blackberry juice, one 
pound of sugar, one-half ounce of nutmeg, one-half ounce 
ot cinnamon, one-fourth of an ounce of cloves, one-fourth 
of an ounce of allspice. 



XXI.— MODERN FACILITIES FOR 
COOKING. 

IMPROVEMENTS multiply on all sides in these days of 
rapid progress, and they have not failed to leave their 
impress on culinary matters. The rude methods of the 
now barbarous nations were once the only methods ot 
cookery. But the better people struggled for better 
methods, and improvements came. These ran to refinements 
here and there, which the richer and more luxurious only 
could adopt. Among those who could afford it, means of 
cooking fairly good won their way rapidly, but the masses 
knew nothing of such indulgences. They long continued to 
put up with inconvenient and inefficient methods. 

Real progress is made when the people as a whole are 
made more comfortable. What lifts up the lower classes is 
real elevation. A spire may tower high amid surroundings 
where the people grovel in marsh and malaria. The spire 
itself may be the best of its kind, but genuine improvement 
would raise the grade where it stands and better the condi- 
tion of the masses at its base. So in cookery. Those 
astounding feasts of the olden time were but spires, shoot- 
ing into conspicuous view, while the people were in beggary 
about them. 

But the culinary grade has been raised. The people are 
better off to-day than ever they were. They have better 
material for food ; they have better knowledge of the uses 
of food, and better facilities for its proper, savory, and health- 
ful preparation. To some of these facilities attention may 
properly be given. 

Open wood fires — mere bonfires, in fact — were the first and 
simplest means of cooking. Over these, boilinc^ could be 

•251 



MODERN FAClLiriES FOR COOKING. 255 

done, or broiling, or frying ; before them cabobs could be 
roasted, or toasted, on the end of a stick ; or better viands 
could be cooked on the " spit," or some kindred contrivance 
that would hold the meat in the direct radiation of the fire, 
and turn it continually, so that all sides might be equally 
cooked. In the hot ashes of such fires, vegetables could be 
roasted, and even meats could be prepared. 

From open fires it was but a step to inclosed fire-places, 
by which the draft might be improved, the smoke disposed 
of to better advantage, and the heat be confined and concen- 
trated for more economical employment. Ovens, for baking 
and roasting, naturcilly followed. As metals came into more 
general use and became cheaper, their employment to form 
stoves was. natural. These, at first, were for wood and the 
lighter fuels, but they soon were adapted to coal as its em- 
ployment became general. 

Rivalry among manufacturers rapidly led to improvement 
upon improvement, until we have our splendid stoves — so 
numerous, so beautiful, and yet so effective. An exterior 
view of a standard modern cooking stove, adaptable for 
either wood or coal, is given on the following page ; not that 
it is in appearance novel or unusual, but that it is a fine 
specimen of this splendid line of domestic applianceg. 

The best coal stoves of this day, whether for cooking or 
heating purposes, are fitted with the anti-clinker grates. By 
this apparatus, access to the bottom of the fire is had 
directly, and clinkers can be removed as well as the fine 
ashes. The clear bottom, so essential to a strong fire and a 
good heat, can always be secured by this improvement. The 
necessity of letting the fire go out occasionally, so as to 
secure a clear, strong heat, is entirely done away with. A 
perpetual fire may be maintained, and it may always be clear 
and strong. 

The cooking capacity of modern stoves is marvelous. 
The largest family roasts can be managed, with all the vege-

tables pertaining thereto, while at the same time a tank of 
warm water is maintained, dishes are kept warm, etc., etc., 
to the heart's content of the most exacting housewife. The 
home where these facilities are lacking is a home that is 
behind the times and below its privileges. The wives and 
mothers should no more confine themselves to old appli- 
ances for cooking than the men should confine themselves 
to old methods of agriculture and travel. 




MODERN COOKING-STOVE FOR WOOD OR COAL. 

Permanent ranges have superseded cook-stoves very gen- 
erally in the cities and in the more substantial houses. 
There is much in their favor, not the least item being their 
compactness. In a recess, not of much value for other pur- 
poses, the range may do its all-important work. It never 
projects into the room, or occupies central space, as does the 
stove. Its capacity for union with a system of water dis- 
tribution, so that hot water may be supplied to the whole 
house, is a very valuable consideration. Without attention

and all incidental purposes, its supply is always ready. A 
permanent range may have its ash-pit also, into which the 
entire waste falls, without raising dust or doing damage, and

The cut of a modern range just given shows most of its 
features of excellence. The anti-clinker grate, with its pecu- 
liar contrivance for cleaning the bottom of the fire, is seen. 
This work can be done every morning with less trouble than 
it takes to rake the old kind of ranges, and a continuous 
fire may be kept going always fresh on the grate. By this 
means a quicker fire and hotter oven can be produced. 
The dish-warmer, top shelf, circulating boiler for hot water, 
ovens, draft dampers, etc., etc., all appear. The open oven 
shows the hot-air circulation about it, when the heat is 
turned to it for roasting purposes. Such a range is not 
much more expensive than a stove of equal cooking capa- 
city, but the setting and the plumbing, if it be added, in- 
crease the cost. For ranges of this construction, experts 
claim many marked advantages, among them these: A 
perpetual fire, free from slate.or clinkers ; a perfectly heated 
oven, without causing the range to become red hot on top, 
so avoiding the burning out of centre plates and covers ; 
perfection in baking, broiling, boiling, stewing, and every 
variety of cooking ; ample room in the oven ; durability of 
grates and fire-brick and great economy in fuel. These 
ranges have also a hinged broiler plate, which need not be 
lifted off when broiling, but may be simply swung back ; also 
- an improved feeder door, which allows perfect control of the 
fire. 

When the stove and range for domestic use are passed 
by, and those for eating-houses, hotels, etc., are to be con- 
sidered, marvels of size and completeness are found. 
Special adaptations are added to these immense culinary 
machines, by which all kinds and almost all amounts of 
work can be done at one time with the utmost possible ease. 
Steam is used very extensively in these operations, espe- 
cially in boiling, but apparatuses on this scale are hardly, 
applicable to domestic uses. For most housekeepers, 
the kitchen of a mammoth hotel would be a genuine show,

not only in the immensity of its equipment, but also in the 
subhme carelessness with which its operations are carried on. 
But coal, wood, and steam are not the only powers 
applied for cooking in domestic circles. Another claimant 
for recognition, and one rapidly winning his way to the 
front, is found in 

MODERN GAS STOVES. 

These can be used wherever natural or artificial gas is 
supplied for illuminating purposes, either by public or pri- 
vate means. Wherever heat is needed and gas can be had, 
gas stoves have a province. Whether for warming apart- 
ments, supplying heat for mechanical purposes, or for cook- 
ing, gas stoves are carefully adapted to meet the varied 
demands. The purpose in this discussion is not to give the 
pre-eminence to any of the several gas stoves which claim 
public favor, but simply to present the subject as met by 
stoves of one standard make, allowing those who are inter- 
ested to work out the remaining problems for themselves. 

The convenience and comfort of cooking by gas, espe- 
cially during the summer months, when fire is not other- 
wise required, can be thoroughly appreciated only by those 
who have had experience in its use for that purpose. It has 
many advantages, among them these : With a good gas 
cooking-stove the difficulty arising from slow fires, quick fires, 
and bright fires vanish at once and forever in the simple 
turning of a tap, admitting more or less gas, the cook con- 
trolling the fire instead of the fire controlling the cook. The 
cook, having the fire directly under her control, the heat can 
be regulated to a nicety; it is not variable, and it is as 
readily obtained as it is easy to be got rid of when no longer 
required. Not the least difficult of the many branches of a 
cook's education is the acquirement of experience in roast- 
ing. She.has to calculate aqd weigh with much nicety both 
the size of the joints and the power of the fire. A good gas 



260 'rHE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

oven, however, can be controlled so easily than an even and 
suitable heat is guaranteed. 

Then, too, it is claimed that the waste in meat cooked by 
gas is greatly diminished as compared with that cooked by 
a coal fire. Meat roasted by a coal fire loses one-third in 
weight, or thirty-three and one-third per cent., while the same 
cooked by gas loses only about one-seventh, or fourteen per 
cent. This difference is due to the fact, that by the usual 
methods of roasting, the meats are shut up in a tight oven, 
which, by its dry and highly heated air, extracts and con- 
sumes the moisture of the meats. The gas oven, on the 
other hand, is open. The heating is by direct radiation 
from the reflectors. Less loss results, therefore, by evapo- 
ration of juices than from the tight oven, as the atmosphere 
about the meat is not exhausted of its natural moisture, so 
becoming a drain upon the moisture in the meat. 

The lighting and extinguishing of gas is an instantaneous 
operation, neither entailing the drudgery, waste of fuel, of 
time, or of patience belonging to other . methods. And in 
this case there is no coal to bring up, no ashes to empty, no 
kindling-wood needed, no waste of fuel, but, a single match 
kindles it all, and the work goes on. 

There has been strong prejudice against cooking by gas, 
which has greatly retarded its general use. Within the last 
few years, however, this has been giving away, as the advan- 
tages of gas for this purpose are becoming more widely 
recognized, and the construction of the stoves has been so 
greatly improved. 

The objections to thus utilizing gas have been chiefly a 
belief in its flavoring the meat, the difficulty of burning it so 
as to avoid smoking and dirt, and its expense as compared 
with other fuel. There can be no doubt that some gas 
stoves are very extravagant and wasteful, nevertheless, the 
objections raised are not regarded as well founded. It can be 
shown satisfactorily that real economy results from their use.

A series of carefully conducted experiments between a 
standard coal range and a standard gas stove is summed up 
in the tables which follow. 

In these experiments the Sun Dial Gas Stove, of the 
Goodwin Gas Stove Company, was used. The results were 
communicated officially to the Convention of Gas Operators 
at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, October i6th, 
1879.

the above results go far to settle the question of relative 
economy. Experience has settled the question of flavor 
also. There is no more need of ill- flavor in food cooked 
by gas than in food cooked otherwise. In any case, it is a 
result of bad management, not of the kind of fuel. 

After this general survey of gas stoves, a more detailed 
view of them will 
be in order. Be-

greatly increasing the cooking power. This stove will broil a 
steak,,chbps, bacon or fish, toast bread, boil water, stew or fry 
with one burner only. Three feet of gas, at a cost of less 
than one cent, will broil a chop and boil a pint of water. 
Consumption, ten cubic feet of gas per hOur. 

Departing from the old system of gas cooking, which 
was open to many grave objections, the gas burner in the 
best stoves, like those shown here, is placed above the meat, 
and not under it ; over this burner is fixed a radiating metal 
plate to reflect the heat; the same burner being above the 
meat and beneath the oven, where the oven attachment 
exists, answers both for the purpose of roasting and 'baking 
at the same time. By another simple contrivance, of sur- 
rounding the oven with a case or jacket, the heat is in- 
creased, the combustion is rendered complete, and a regular

distribution of heat all over the oven is secured. In all 
the stoves now in use, the oven is always hottest in that 
part nearest the fire, consequently it is a common occurence 
for food to be raw in one part and burnt in another. This, 
is prevented by the hot air jacket surrounding the oven. 

The next cut shows the oven attachment, the heat being 
applied beneath it and over the roast, and the heat both

the oven. The size

combustion as is accomplished by similar means in the ordi- 
nary kinds of fuel. This arrangement fills a want that has 
long been felt by those who have objected to the use of gas 
stoves for the reason of there being no adequate means to 
, remove the products of combustion and odors from the 
roasting chambers, ovens, and boiling burners, all of which 
is now effectually accomplished. 

The possibilities of the gas stove are not exhausted, how- 
;ever, by;the forms already shown. Still another cut is given 
of x)ne of, the>most complete gas-stoves. This size will do

they will "find it superior in every respect. Consumption,'

Suchis a brief showing of the cooking-stoves using gas 
as fuel. With them a household can be relieved of much of 
the work -which makes life a burden ; but these helps do not 
apply to> family uses only. Hotels have adopted the:m.' 
Stoves and ranges can be furnished to cook for any number 
of persons'. ""At the new hotel at Piilltnan, III, the cookitag.

one thousand five hundred dollars. It includes a complete 
set of fish broilers, two large hot closets for warming dishes, 
a sixty-gallon tank for the supply of hot water, and six 
large roasting and broiling chambers, over which are forty- 
eight burners for boiling, stewing, and frying. Three large 
ovens, with twenty-four burners over them, are also in- 
cluded in the complete apparatus. 

Another feature in the great gas range of this hotel is its 
carving-table and hot closets. The water in this table is 
heated by a hot-Water generator with gas heat, and the 
closets are supplied with two burners each, by which they 
can be raised to any desirable temperature. Egg boilers, 
vegetable boilers, and cake griddles complete this elaborate 
cooking apparatus. 

Water-heating apparatus is a great point in connection 
with the Pullman Range. There are very many of these 
applications which are available in private houses. From 
the little arrangement for heating a pint of water, there are 
others of larger capacity, up to those capable of heating a 
bath-tub full or of providing for a family wash. A very 
convenient apparatus for supplying hot water to a wash 
basin which has cold water only is shown in the opposite 
cut. The " generator " is placed on a little bracket, and an 
attachment is made from the gas burner, and also from the 
cold-water pipe. On lighting the gas, hot water is gene- 
rated almost instantly, and is supplied in quantity sufficient 
for all probable demands, as the generator contains a coil of 
pipe in passing through which the water can hardly fail of 
being thoroughly heated. The generator can be had in 
ornamental or plain forms, and its consumption of gas is 
but ten cubic feet per hour. 

Rural homes which supply water from a tank can adopt 
this generator with ease. Indeed, wherever water flows 
and a gas jet is available, hot water can be had at plea- 
sure.

Gas stoves supply many incidental conveniences also that 

These are of vari- 
ous diameters, from 
five inches upward. 
They consume from 
seven cubic feet per

for all incidental 
small cookery they 
are very useful.

Another gas-stove specialty is the Waffle Baker also

ing work quickly and well, wholly avoiding the burning, so 
apt to spoil waffles baked in other ways. Restaurants find 
this apparatus very helpful, and families, too, will enjoy it, as 
long waiting for hot cakes is avoided, and the cakes, when 
served, are just right. The baking molds are so arranged, 
that by a crank attached to the projecting spindle they may 



2t2 '^'ii^ HOUSEWIFlE'S LlBRAkY. 

be turned over to secure equal baking on both sides. Thus 
the arrangement is perfectly effective while entirely simple. 
In view of what may be done with gas, it is not strange 
that in discussing " The Fuel of the Future " it should re- 
ceive special recognition. Many there are who look to the 
time when coal and wood fires will be virtually unknown in 
the cities, and when arrangements for heating will be like 
those for illumination, furnished by outside parties, and paid 
for as used. In localities where natural gas is found, this is 
already practically realized to a great extent. But there 
are other views as to the fuel of the future, as the next dis- 
cussion will show. Of course, these novelties in domestic 
operations are resisted. Our grandmothers did not do 
things in this way. But again the old text may be quoted : 
" Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good." 



OIL STOVES. 



MODERN facilities in the way of cook-stoves are not 
restricted to places where gas is available. In small 
villages, and in purely rural homes, oil may be used 
for cooking, as for illuminating purposes, in the place of gas. 
Which of various oil stoves is the best is not our province 
to decide, nor is such a decision necessary. But it is our 
province to illustrate the subject of oil stoves fully, which 
will be done by reference to one good standard stove, from 
which others do not differ, probably, in any very important 
respects. 

In the Florence oil stove there is a cast-iron base, more 
or less elevated, which is the receiver of the oil, which 
should be of the best quality. Such oils, being purer than 
others, are less liable to produce smoke and unpleasant 
odor, which are certainly objectionable. 

From this oil-receiver the wick, or wicks, proceed, each

furnishing a flame four inches in width, and regulated, as in 
oil-lamps, by thumb-screws. Over these wicks is the stove 
apparatus, with various adaptations for warming or for 
cooking, and of varying powers, as may be desired. The 
chamber immediately above the flame is capable of easy re- 
moval or of being thrown backward on a hinge joint, to 
allow access to the wicks 
for trimming and to fa- 
cilitate cleansing the ap- 
paratus. The oil-receiv- 
ing base, the regulating 
screws for three wicks, 
the heat chamber, with 
the flames seen through 
the mica doors, and the 
top work, capable of va- 
rious applications, are all 
shown in the adjacent cut. oil stove with cooking drum. 

For some uses the amount of flame secured by three 
wicks is more than is needed. Smaller contrivances arc, 
therefore, prepared, one of which, called the Nursery Stove, 
is shown in the cut. Much less oil is 
required here, one wick only is used, 
and yet the kettle may be boiled, an iron 
heated, or almost any light culinary work 
be done. Beyond the nursery, this little 
stove is especially adapted for use by 
milliners, dressmakers, druggists, bar- 
bers, saloon-keepers, and for manufac- 
turers, to heat glue, to heat irons, etc. 
It is perfectly safe for use in the home, 
or in factories and shops. It is strong enough to sustain a 
weight of two hundred pounds, and cooking utensils of any 
kind can be used upon it when desired. Offices, libraries, 
etc., will find it of great value too. 




NURSERY STOVE. 



274 



THE HOUSE WIFE'S. LIBRARY. 



A very helpful use of small oil stoves is found by parties 
camping out or going on picnics. The whole apparatus is 
easily carried, and it is ready to boil a kettle, to fry a mess 
of fish, or to do any of the many little things for which a 
fire is needed on a camp-ground. It is often desirable to 
have a little heat in the home late in the spring or early in 
the fall, or on a cool and rainy summer day, or in case of 
sickness, when the chill needs to be taken from a room. 
The stoves are down ; the furnace is dismantled ; there is no 
fireplace in the room ; but you have an oil stove. All right 
then. Remove the cooking top, and add a heating drum ; 
in other words, transform the stove as shown in the first cut 

to the stove as seen in 
adjoining cut. This is 
ornamental and effective, 
affording ample heat in 
all ordinary weather for 
rooms of usual size. One 
wick only of the three 
shown in this stove may 
be used at a time if less 
heat is desired. 

Adhering to the same 
three-wick base, it may, 
however, become desira- 
ble to enlarge the cook- 
ing resources. This may 
be easily accomplished. 
On the cooking drum a 
broad Extension Top is 
readily adjustable. This 
is of cast iron, and it is so fitted with dampers that heat can 
be concentrated at any one point of the extension, or dif- 
fused with available cooking power among them all. The 
cut on the next page shows the oven, the teakettle, the Steam

Cooker, and the saucepan, all in operation. The Steam 
Cooker is a contrivance to economize room. "In its lower 
part is a waterpan, over which are other tiers of pans, in 
each of which a different vegetable may be cooked at one 
and the same 



time by means of 
steam from the 
boiling water be- 
low. Thus a lit- 
tle stove may do 
a great work. 

For a heavier 
culinary demand 
an enlarged ap- 
paratus may be 
employed. This 
is nothing more 
nor less than a 
doubling of what 
has already been 
described. The 
cut on page 276, 
illustrates a dou- 
ble stove, with

elevating stand and extension top. This is regarded as 
ample accommodation for a family of six persons. It per- 
forms all the offices of the most elaborate kitchen range, and 
for roasting meats, broiling and baking is unequaled by 
them, for the reason that in no stove or range is the fire and 
consequent heat so completely under control of the cook. 
Various designs of these stoves are prepared, which con- 
tain all the most approved principles of construction, and 
are especially happy in the effects obtained, the trimmings 
being elaborately nickled and really very handsome. 

In the running of these stoves, the principles to be 



276 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



observed are few and simple. The gist of them are added 
below as illustrative of the processes. 

Any good kerosene oil suitable to burn in lamps can be 
used for the best results in cooking and heating, or to avoid 
odor the best water white oil, of not less than one hundred 
and fifty degrees fire test, is recommended. The best at 
command will in all cases be found the most satisfactory. 




DOUBLE OIL STOVE \(^ITH EXTENSION TOP. 

Only such wicks as are furnished for this especial purpose 
should be used. They can be sent by mail when desired. 
Be certain the wick fills the wick tube, to prevent escape of 
gas. New wicks produce best results, because they afford 
free passage for oil. Wicks which have stood in oil for a 
length of time become clogged with paraffine and foreign 
substances. Changing wicks as often as four to six weeks 
is therefore desirable. 

Fill the reservoir with oil, but do not run it over. One- 



MODERN FACILITIES FOR COOKING. 211 

wick Stoves hold one quart; two-wick stoves hold two 
quarts; three-wick stoves hold three quarts; four-wick 
stoves hold six quarts. Trim the wicks evenly, slightly 
rounding the corners. When new wicks are put in, wait 
until they become saturated with oil before lighting. Use 
the same care in regulating the flame which is required for 
an ordinary kerosene lamp. Wicks should never be so 
turned down that the flame will be below the top of the 
cones. 

It is important that the stove be kept perfectly clean. 
There should be a regular time (daily when the stove is in 
constant use) for filling the reservoir and wiping the stove 
clean in every part. The perforated circular plate which sets 
over the wick tubes must be kept clean. When the stove 
is not in use, the wick should be turned down a little below 
the top of the wick tubes, so that the oil will not flow out- 
side of the base. The wick tubes should be thoroughly 
cleaned from crusts and deposits, and rubbed bright as 
often as once a week ; a piece of sand-paper is convenient 
to use for this purpose. This is important to insure a per- 
fect flame and prevent undue heating of the tubes. Before 
setting the stove aside for a length of time, empty the oil, 
and before filling it again rinse out well and put in new 
wicks. A clean stove, new wicks, and fresh oil of the right 
grade, will insure satisfactory results. 

In extinguishing the burners, simply turn the wick down 
a little below the top of the wick tube and leave the flame 
to go out of itself In this way all gases are consumed and 
smell of oil avoided. 

With care in observing such plain hints, the oil stove 
may become a very helpful and convenient accessory in the 
affairs of every house. Housekeepers should certainly give 
them attention when the question of home comfort arises.

KITCHEN UTENSILS. 

POTS, kettles, pans, and such common-place articles have 
been familiar to every housewife, time immemorial. But 
even these have not escaped the transforming touch of 
improvement. Take, as an example, the common soup-pot. 
Its old style of lid would lie loosely when the heat was 
doing its work, allowing the rich odors to escape and the 
steam to waste. Now the lid is clamped tight on the pot, 
a valve allowing steam to escape when it must, and so re- 
taining in the pot all the heat and flavor which can possibly 
be held there. The fact is, that business rivalry has stimu- 
lated inventors, manufacturers, and dealers to seek for per- 
fect articles. The result is that housekeepers may be splen- 
didly supplied. 

When a complete kitchen equipment is urged, penny-wise 
and pound-foolish housewives cry out against the cost. 
Better, however, spare some expensive adornment else- 
where, and fit up the kitchen as becomes the cooking 
department of an intelligent home. 

Innumerable things are needed in the kitchen, and they 
should be good. Good tinware, good ironware, good 
woodenware, good stock and tools of all kinds are by far 
the cheapest in the long run. Get fewer articles at first, 
but get them good. Get, as opportunity offers, knives, forks, 
spoons, nut picks, steel, cheese scoop, cleaver, salad fork 
and spoon, coffee mill, ice chisel, nutmeg grater, coal sifter, 
strawberry huUer, potato slicer, cabbage cutter, colander, 
broiling irons, etc., etc., over the broad range into which we 
simply peep in this chapter. 

Among things rarely used in kitchens, but very valuable, 
are cutting boards, made of hard wood and in various sizes, 
on which to cut bread, slice meat, chip dried beef, etc.; 
deep pans for frying in the French style, which submerges 
the articles in boiling fat ; a scale and weights, to test goods

purchased and to make accurate use of materials in cook- 
ing; a set of measures, for the same purpose; plain egg 
boilers, or patent ones which whistle, ring a bell, etc., when 
the egg is done ; sand glasses of various sizes for noting 
time in the boiling of eggs, etc. ; an egg beater, of which 
the " Dover " is generally regarded as best ; coffee-pots in 
some of the scientific forms; and so onward in another 
broad sweep. 

House-furnishing goods may be catalogued thus: Brass 
and copper ware ; cutlery and hardware ; agate and granite 
wares ,- britannia ware ; planished or block tinware ; stamped 
tinware ; japanned ware ; wood and willow ware ; carved 
and fancy v/oodenware ; brushes, brooms, etc. ; wire goods ; 
papier-mache goods ; iron goods, and miscellaneous goods. 
Such is the usual classification of the catalogues of the lead- 
ing manufacturers, some of which give over a thousand 
illustrations of household utensils in forms and fashions the 
most diverse, and yet, aS a rule, strikingly beautiful. In- 
deed, one who has not consulted the catalogues of extensive 
dealers can have no idea of the variety of goods offered. 

While commending the broad range of appliances which 
open before the housekeeper, it may be well, however, to 
quote a paragraph from Ella Rodman Church's bright book. 
How to Furnish a Home. She says : " Some kitchens 
are fitted up so luxuriously, with a perfect army of porce- 
lain-lined saucepans, folding gridirons, oyster-broilers, flesh- 
forks, larding- needles, perforated and grooved spoons, pie- 
crimpers, steamers, marble paste boards and rollers, egg- 
beaters, and all the thousand-and-one labor-saving contriv- 
ances, that their equipment is quite as expensive as that of 
other portions of the house. Much of this is unnecessary, 
especially to the young housekeeper ; and, where there is 
not a very full purse, it is better to provide only WKJ^-haves 
in the beginning, and leave would-haves to be gathered by 
degrees."

Broilers. — There is great variety in the utensils employed 
for broiling meats, fish, etc. The two cuts here given show 
the large, strong wire 
broiler suitable for the 
heaviest pieces, and 
the fine-wired, small 
sized broiler adapted 
for oysters and the 
most delicate of birds. 
The double construction of these 
broilers enables them to be turned 
over with ease, for the purpose of 
doing both sides to a nicety. At least 
two sizes of broilers are needed in 
every well-stocked kitchen, though 
more would be of use to meet the 
many and varied demands of the average American home. 
Small Cake Pans. — Pans for biscuits, cookeys, gems, pat- 
ties, muffins, etc., can be had in all styles, simple and orna- 
mental. We show the 
(i) Turk's Head Muffin 
Pan; (2) the plain Bis- 
cuit Pah ; and (3) the 
plain Muffin Pan. But 
this showing by no means 
exhausts the variety. Al- 
most every form of the 
housewife's fancy can be 
met at the house-furnish- 
ing stores, so far as these 
incidentals to nice cook- 
ery are concerned. Every 
kitchen needs a few such

Molds for Puddings, etc.— A plain pudding mold and 
fluted rice mold are shown in these cuts. They have the 

hot-water column 

at the centre to 
IliilUBlHI insure a complete 

cooking. Each has 

a tight-fitting lid, 

with loops for ty- 
ing the lid in position, and thus they form a complete utensil 
for the cooking of puddings, rice, etc. 

Asparagus' Boiler. — Every cook knows the difficulty of 
removing boiled asparagus from the pot. 
Here is a utensil of proper size and shape, 
having a movable deck or shelf, on which 
the vegetable lies in cooking, and on which 
it is removed straight and whole when done. Similar 
boilers are arranged for fish. 

Strainers. — Aside from ordinary colanders for straining 
purposes, there are others adapted 
specially for soups, jellies, etc., 
one of which is here shown. The 
hook opposite the handle holds 
the cloth in case one is used in 
the process. 

Batter Pails. — In making batter ca>£s it is better to avoid 
dipping the batter, as this process 
cuts the air vesicles in it and 
promotes heaviness. To pour 
it neatly and expeditiously is 
better, and for this the batter 
pail is adapted. The batter 
should be mixed in the pail 
and poured directly from it, so 
avoiding all unnecessary agitation and consequent injury.

Apple Parer. — So great is the consumption of apples in 
cookery that an apple parer is a domestic necessity. The 

one shown in the cut is 
known as the Bay State 
Apple Paring and Slic- 
ing Machine. It is quite 
justly regarded as the 
very best ever made. 
The little machine is 
clamped by the thumb- 
screw to a table. It 
pares and slices the 
fruit, and deposits the 
slices in a dish. Its 
operation is quick, effective, certain, and simple. 

Can Opener. — One of the standing annoyances of house- 
keepers is the opening of cans containing fruits, vegetables, 

etc. It is certain 
' that the ordinary 
tools employed for this purpose 
are very defective. They are 
hard to operate, dangerous to 
handle, and rough in results. 
The accompanying cut shows the 
Clipper Can Opener in position 
for service. It is screwed on to 
any convenient place. The table 
on which the can stands is ad- 
justed by a ratchet movement to any height of 
can. The knife is curved to meet the circle of 
the can. It can easily be thrust through' the tin, 
when, by a rotary motion, it Will cut the top out 
as cleanly as if cut by straight shears. This cut- 
ter is a specialty of the Cowles Hardware Co., of 
Unionville. Conn.

Molds. — For jellies and cakes these are supplied in 
abundant variety Fine cakes and jellies may be furnished 
in plain forms, but in 
the ornamental forms 
they are far prettier, 
and can be just as 
well cooked or cooled. 

Cake Pans. — A plain cake mold with hot-air tube in centre 
is here shown. Also the spring-bottom pan, which is taken 
off the cake, and not ^g-—~—= — 
the cake out of it, |HL._„^ '^ 
thus avoiding " stick- f| TK^ Jii

Forks. — An assortment of large, strong forks is very 
desirable in a kitchen. They not only handle meats with 
ease and safety, but they save 
the hands from exposure to 
scalding steam, from which one 
cannot escape if ordinary forks 
are employed. 

lyfilk Boilers. — How hard it is to boil milk, or any of the 
milk preparations, without scorching, is well known by 








bitter experience in every household. By using a boiler 
like these shown here, with water in the lower vessel, all 
the danp-er is obviated.

Cherry Stoner. — In preserving cherries or making cherry 
pies, one of the most troublesome things is to get rid of the 

stones. The Family 
Cherry Stoner, here 
shown, does the work 
very well, preserving 
the plumpness of the 
cherry and saving all 
its juices, but effectu- 
ally removing its stone. 
There are other stoners 
in the market, but this 
in preserving the form 
of the cherry surpasses 
them all. It is as nearly perfect as any machine can be. It 
seems endowed with intelligence.

Apple Corer and Slicer. — The contrivance here shown is 
the Climax Corer and Slicer, a fit companion for the ordi- 
nary apple parer. 
The pared apples 
are set upon this 
instrument, which 
also is clamped to 
a table, when by a 
slight movement 
they are cored and 
sliced, the slices 
falling into a pan 
and the core being held in position until removed by hand. 
How wonderful an advance this is over the old 
method of gouging out cores by means of ordinary 
knives need not be told. Nor need housewives be 
reminded of its superiority to the old style of 
apple-corer, which we show for the sake of contrast.

■ Paaing Knife. — A good help in paring vegetables or fruits 
is shown in the cut here given. It consists simply of a 
guide attached to the 
blade of a knife, as hete 
illustrated, by means of 
which a uniform thick- 
ness of paring is secured. 
The same attachment will secure uniformity in slicing. 

Fish Turner.— How difficult it is to turn a fish without 
breaking it every cook knows. But trouble may be 
obviated by- the use of such a 
tool as is here pictured. For 
many other uses, as a scraper of 
pie-boards, etc., it will be found 
very" useful. Its blade is thin 
and full of spring, but not sharp 
at the edges. Those who have 
used this article prize it highly. 
It does good work and does it 
with great ease. 

Lemon Squeezer, — Everybody 
knows of this valuable kitchen 
utensil, but of the porcelain bowl 
and compress shown here all 
may . not know. This arrange- 
ment is far superior to the ordi- 
nary wooden squeezer. The 
hinge is tinned to avoid rust, and 
is strong enough to safely bear 
all the pressure that may be 
needed to entirely extract the 
juices of the lemon. Such an 
article is far more economical 
than the old method of squeezing.

Bread Miser and Kneader. — The Butcher Temple Goflipany, . 
of Hopedale, Mass., has patented the Mixer and Kneader 

shown in the next cut, and 
known by the name of 
its inventor, Stanyan. It 
is claimed that this ma- 
chine saves time and 
labor; that it is easily 
operated, and that, too, by unskilled help ; that it saves 
touching the dough with the hands before baking, thereby 
insuring clean bread ; that it avoids the use of the molding- 
board and consequent addition of dry flour after raising; 
and that it is equally well adapted to mixing fruit-cake, 
mince-meat, etc. 

These are high claims, certainly, but Miss Parloa, the 
accomplished instructress in cookery, spbaks concerning it 
in the following laudatory terms : " I find in it an article 
the want of which I have always felt. It cuts and beats up 
the dough at the same time, a process which gives you a 
fine, light bread." She also says, " No kitchen should be 
without it," and she certainly ought to know. 

Covers. — Who wants cold food when warm can be had ? 

Covers of all sizes and styles can be had whereby much of 
this evil is avoided. They are made 
from seven inches to twenty-four in 
length, at prices from fifty cents 
upward. The upper style will cover 
a beefsteak, a plate of chops, a fiSh, 
or any such articles which do not 
stand high upon the plate. The 
other style may be used for roasts. 
When ready to carve, they may be 
removed by the attendant, and the 

meats will be found steaming hot and very savory.

Nut Crack. — Why should people hammer their fingers 
cracking nuts when such a tool as that here shown can be 




had for a few dimes ? Half the delight of eating nuts is de- 
stroyed by the old style of cracking. By the new style the 
delight is doubled. 

Broom Holder. — This is a neat and simple contrivance, cost- 
ing but a few cents, and yet capable of holding any broom 
as shown in the cut. It is 
screwed to any wood-work. The 
broom is suspended by simply 
slipping it in from the underside 
and withdrawing the hand. The 
pinch of the leverage holds it 
firmly. To remove the broom 
the end of the holder needs 
simply to be lifted. It does 
away with all necessity of boring 
the broom handles and inserting 
strings, also with the upending 
of brooms behind doors and in 
comers. For each broom in use 
in the home a holder should be 
procured. Then, having a place 
for each, see that each is kept in 
its place. Order, even in so small a matter, is important.

Small Tins. — Tin muffin rings, biscuit cut- 
ters, doughnut cutters, tart cutters, etc., can 
be had in endless variety and at very low 
rates. Every kitchen should be well stocked 
with them. 

Com Grater, — The device here illustrated is known as 
Wood's Green-Corn Grater. It consists of a. curved 





metal standard, provided with a thumb-screw, and termina- 
ting at the upper end in two parallel blades, one serrated, 
the other plain, as shown in upper part of the engraving. 

To operate this grater, clamp it firmly to a table or shelf, 
place the ear of corn across the parallel blades, at right 
angles, then push the ear or draw across the blades, the 
toothed blade first tearing open the kernels, and the plain

Vegetable Slicer. — To neatly slice vegetables is quite an 
art So inaccurate is the movement of an ordinary knife, 

and so tedious withal, 
that all sorts of inven- 
tions have been made 
to facilitate the pro-

vious contrivances are 
surpassed, however,

in the patented slicer shown in the cut. On this the Cowles 
Hardware Company have secured the exclusive right to use 
for a vegetable slicer a knife cutting with both edges, which 
produces a slice at every movement of the hand, enabling 
the cutter to perform double labor in a given time. Its 
simplicity of construction enables it to be sold at a very 
reasonable price. 

Clothes Sprinkler. — To sprinkle clothes evenly is desirable, 
•when in preparation for the ironing process. The apparatus 
shown in the cut is simply a tin 
tube perforated with very fine 
holes and set upon a handle, 
which also acts as a stopper. 
Water may be placed in the tube, out of which it will not 
drip, but it may be shaken in a fine spray as needed.

Ciafing Dishes. — These valuable aids to warm food can be 
had in sizes from ten inches to twenty-four and complete at 

prices from about two dollars 
upward. The cuts show the 
chafing dish stand inclosing the 
lamps, the water-pan to secure 
evenness of heat, and the plate 
for containing the delicacy to be 
served. Covers, such as have 
been shown already, are suitable 
for chafing dishes. Tea urns, 
coffee-pots, soup tureens, etc., are con- 
structed on the same general methods. 
We give a sample of the soup tureen i 
with lamp-stand attachment. The form 
needed for coffee-pots and tea-pots is 
familiar to all. An alcohol lamp makes 
the best heating attachment, as its flame 
is intense and free from smoke. Some 
of these heating arrangements will be prized in every home. 
Potato Parer. — A potato parer differs from an apple parer 
mainly in its capacity for a greater longitudinal and a freer 

vertical movement, to 
fit the different lengths 
and the many inequali- 
ties of the potatoes. 
The little machine here 
shown does all that is 
needed for potatoes, 
and does it rapidly, 
ueatly, and economically. It is valuable for a large family. 





XXn.— INCIDENTAL HELPS. 

NOTHING can go happily and healthfully in the home 
without pure water. No residence is complete without 
it. In promoting health and comfort it is unequaled. 
More disease and suffering are caused by the use of impure 
water than arise from any other one source. If the spores 
brought in the atmosphere from ponds and marshes poi- 
son us, how much more surely will we be poisoned by 
drinking the water which produces them ? Few persons 
would dip a glass of water from a common pond and drink 
it because in that large body of water the impurities are 
visible to the eye, giving the water a clouded, muddy ap- 
pearance ; yet the same impurities are in the water when 
drawn in one's residence, but in the small quantity of water 
the eye does not detect them. A good filter removes all 
the clay, animal and vegetable matter, giving you clear, 
sparkling water. 

Filters. — Where the water does not flow, but is carried 
to the house, a device such as the Jewett Filters is needed, 
though there is the difficulty of cleaning these, which is a 
serious drawback to their value. These filters combine 
with water-coolers also, so doubling their advantages. 

A cheap domestic filter may be made by taking a com- 
mon flower-pot, of large size, inserting a sponge in the hole 
at the bottom, and then filling the pot with alternate layers 
of sand, charcoal, and small pebbles. The pot, thus filled, 
may .stand so as to drain into ajar or other convenient ves- 
sel. Practically this will answer all the purposes of a more 
elaborate and costly affair. 

Where running water is led to a house, filters may be

put on each faucet, and may so cleanse, in a measure, what 
flows through that outlet. But the body of filtering sub- 
stance contained in such an apparatus is small and the 
work is correspondingly defective. The most complete 
filtering apparatus is the Loomis Automatic Filter. 

This apparatus is connected with 
the water-supply pipe of the house 
and filters all the water used there. 
It varies in size according to the ca- 
pacity of the supply pipe. It will last 
as long as the iron pipes, there be- 
ing absolutely nothing about it to get 
out of order, or wear out in a lifetime. 
The filter is cleansed daily, by sim- 
ply shifting the lever seen in the cut. 
Any filter that cannot be cleansed 
daily poisons instead of purifying wa- 
ter after it has been used two days. 
As the matter arrested by a filter pu- 
trifies in two days, if it remain in the 
filter, the result is obvious. In the 
cut of this filter, I shows the inlet 
of the water from the regular supply 
pipe. The lever being as shown, the water passes into and 
through the two filtering chambers of the apparatus. Pass- 
ing out at the bottom, the water is served to the entire 
house by the outlet O. To cleanse the filtering substances, 
reverse the lever. This throws the water supply into the 
bottom and out into the waste-water pipe, by the outlet W. 
Five minutes per day of this flow will keep the filter 
sweet and pure indefinitely. 

Ret'igerators. — Unless one has a very cold cellar, or 
a model spring house, a refrigerator is a necessity, that food 
may be kept safely in warm weather. There are refrig- 
erators with chemical action, which secure a temperature

able, being far too complex and expensive.

mestic uses. The patterns are many, and for each supe- 
riority is claimed. There are a few points to be observed in 
any such article ; for instance, the cleanliness of the lining.

the preponderating sentiment accords superiority to the 
zinc, as capable of more thorough cleansing, and as least 
likely to hold grease, odor, or other unpleasantness. 

The walls of the refrige^ 
rator should be packed with 
charcoal, or contain an in- 
closed air-chamber, as non- 
conductors of heat. In the 
body of the refrigerator, pro- 
vision must be made to per- 
mit free movement of the 
cold air from the ice, and yet 
the drippings from the ice- 
box must not reach the other 
parts. A convenient attach- 
ment to many refrigerators 
retains the melting from the 
ice, that it may be drawn for 
drinking purposes. It is ob- 
jected that this method con- 
sumes more ice, but it cer- 
tainly does more work, and 
avoids all trouble with the 
ordinary drainage from the 
ice-box. A purchaser should 
consider the several points 
presented here before decid- 
ing what choice to make. 

Ornamental forms are 
given to refrigerators when 
desired, so that they are suitable for even elegantly furnished 
dining-rooms, as is shown in the " Empress " on the pre- 
ceding page. This article combines all the modern con- 
veniences with the best external finish. The " Snow-flake " 
is another ornamental form, intended for use in the nursery.

It furnishes cold water, while it preserves milk, fruit, etc.,

cooling apparatus. 

Ice-cream Freezers. — A good ice-cream freezer is a valu- 
able accessory in any household. There are many such 
freezers, and Philadelphia has long enjoyed the distinction 
of being the centre of their manufacture. Packer's 
Standard Freezer, shown in the cuts below, is a good illus- 
tration of the completeness of these articles. They are

made in size from two quarts to forty quarts. The first 
cut shows the apparatus ready for use. The second shows 
it in sections, displaying the internal construction. The 
dasher or beater has a self-adjusting scraper, fitting closely 
to the inner surface of the can, which removes the frozen 
cream as rapidly as formed, while the deflectors direct 
the unfrozen portions to the sides of the can. By these 
appliances, the v/hole body of cream is constantly changing 
position and is most thoroughly beaten, insuring rapid and 
uniform freezing, and producing the most perfect smooth-

ness and richness with the largest amount of frozen cream 
that it is possible to make from the amount of pure cream 
used. The crank arrangement for turning this freezer and 
its internal machinery is a great labor-saver. It also does 
much more rapid work than can be done by hand-power 
alone. From fifteen to thirty minutes is the time usually 
required to freeze a can of cream, according to its size. No 
tools, however, can compensate for the absence of good 
ingredients. The best freezer cannot improve the quality of 
poor cream or of skimmed milk.

Household Management. 



NEXT to good domestic cooking stands good household 
management. It would be hard to say which is en- 
titled to precedence. There are houses which are 
kept to a nicety, in which the cooking is execrable. There 
are others where good cooking is the one thing that makes 
them endurable. But all good things should be happily 
combined if a really model home is sought. " I am no 
cook," said a newly established housekeeper, " but I am a 
good manager." If her capacity to manage extended to 
managing her cook, and her cook happened to be a good 
one, then things might move smoothly ; but for the best 
results the year through, housekeepers should be queens in 
every part of the home. 

Somebody manages the domestic affairs of almost every 
house. Occasionally it is the man of the house. Sometimes 
it is his mother, or his wife's mother. Oftener it is the cook. 
There are homes where the rightful heads are not heads, but 
are more like tails. Another makes the decisions, and they 
wag assent, or submissively curl themselves up with ill- 
concealed disgust. There are some houses where there is 
no management whatever. Affairs go as a log goes down 
stream. Now one end leads; again the other. Now it goes

broadside ; again it does not go at all. Alas for those who 
dwell in such a house, and call it home ! 

There are private as well as public resting places, where 
those who travel much occasionally stop, where wonderful 
contrasts are visible. One of these was a luxurious home in 
a Southern city. There was no stint because of straitened 
circumstances nor on the score of parsimony. The gentle- 
man and lady were wealthy, generous, and refined. Their 
cook had served long in a restaurant, and was fully compe- 
tent to do any culinary work. The meals were superb. 
They were cooked to a nicety and served to perfection. 
There was plenty, and that, too, of the best sort. 

But, oh ! the condition of the house ! The best guest- 
chamber was laden with odors so offensive that a chancQ 
lodger there began an exploration. Stowed in the bottom 
of the clothes press of the room was accummulated rubbish, 
musty, moldy, mouse-infested, and disgusting. Having no 
means to correct the. evil, the guest left this .closet door wide 
open in the morning, hoping thereby to attract attention to 
its condition and secure its cleansing. But when he re- 
entered the room he found, to his dismay, that the door had 
been carefully closed upon its unsightliness and unwhole. 
someness, the skeleton-maker, if not the " skeleton in the 
closet," being scrupulously retained. 

Such gross mismanagement is to be severely condemned. 
No excuse for it suffices. Common sense and common 
decency demand better management in every home. But 
the " happy-go-easy " inmates of that home saw nothing 
amiss. Of course, management may run to the other 
extreme. A house may be so orderly that a man instinct- 
ively gathers himself together when in it, lest he be caught 
in some of its machinery and be ground to powder ; or, 
what is equally to be dreaded, be the means of disarranging 
some part of that intricate family machine. 

A golden mean in management must be observed. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT. 303 

Enough of it is necessary to compel complete and unceasing 
supervision at every point, so that everything shall be just 
as it should be. But when it becomes an overshadowing 
and awe-inspiring presence — subduing the laugh, suppress- 
ing the smile, restraining the steps, fettering the words — 
then it is a bane and not a blessing. 

Executive ability is in great part a natural endowment. 
Some are bom to rule. Command is natural and easy for 
them. They can organize and execute. But the rarest 
genius in this art will be the better for practice. Experience 
will improve his natural aptitude. And he will gather valu- 
able lessons from the experiences of others. Where others 
fail he will shun to tread, unless the reason of their failure 
he so clearly sees that he is sure of mastery over it. What 
the person of ability sees in others and experiences in him- 
self is capital on which he trades, and from which he derives 
his revenues of advancement. 

If genuises in executive ability grow by what they learn, 
surely those less gifted need to learn the more, that they, 
too, may grow, though their advantages be less. Therefore 
it is that in this department of household management 
directions are given on many practical points of home duty. 
These directions are the results of experience. They may 
seem unimportant, and possibly excessive, but they will help 
the most competent, as well as the least competent, by sug- 
gesting both what to do and what not to do. The old 
maxim, " Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good," 
may well be sounded in the ears of all housekeepers. The 
best housekeepers have reached their proud eminence by 
this wise course. 

As housewives press on to higher and still higher attain-, 
ments, let the words of one of the noblest of their company, 
Mrs. Sigourney, inspire them. She says: "The strength of 
a nation, especially of a republican nation, is in the intelli- 
gent and well-ordered homes of the people." 



I.— MARKETING. 

OPPORTUNITIES vary so in different localities, that 
general rules about marketing are hard to frame. In 
rural places the butcher drives to the door, and the 
customer must be content with what is found in the wagon. 
In villages and, small cities, the butcher shops and stores, 
denominated " Markets," afford a variety more or less 
excellent. Some of the large cities have their market stores, 
and green-grocers, and butcher shops, and great central 
markets, where qualities vary with the prices, and where 
customers of all grades and conditions can be supplied. 

In marketing, as in all other business transactions, it may 
be accepted as a rule, that goods will bring their value. The 
best usually costs most, and in the long run it is the cheapest. 
In such perishable goods as meats, fruits, fish, vegetables, 
etc., there are innumerable chances for fluctuations in price 
and for variation in quality. A judge of these commodities 
may " pick up bargains," but the inexpert and uninitiated 
are more frequently fleeced than favored in catch operations 
at the markets. 

General hints as to the selection of meats, fish, vegeta- 
bles, etc., have already been given in this volume, under the 
department of Cookery, but no hints, and no rules, will suf- 
fice absolutely. Keen and continuous observation, growing 
mto a large and varied experience, are essential to a good 
marketer. There is not a family which has not suffered 
Irom a want of the knowledge that would enable them to 
judge the quality of meats offered them. Often at the 
market an expert is waited on from the best quality and the 
best cuts, while another, with less knowledge, is served from 



MARKETING.

t poorer quality and less desirable cuts. Many a house- 
keeper has been censured for poor cooking, when the fault 
was back of that, and in the quality of the meats ; and 
again, the market man has often been censured for furnish- 
ing poor meats, when the fault was in the cooking. A good 
piece of meat may be spoiled in cooking and a poor piece 
may be made palatable. 

To know the parts of the animals sold in the markets, 
and to undet stand their relative value and most economical 
uses, is the first requisite in successful marketing. Cutting 
of animals varies somewhat among butchers of different 
places, but the chart given below will fairly set forth the 
usual methods of cutting, and the ordinary designations oi 
tlie several portions. 




CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF BEEF. 



In explanation of the illustration of the cutting of beet 
the following notes will suffice : 

No. I. — The choice cut of the beef, the Sirloin, containing 
the kidneys and the tenderloin. These are the finest pieces 
of roasting and steak meat. 

No. 2. — The Standing Rib piece, also a choice roasting por- 
tion, which includes about eleven of the ribs. 



306 THE HOUSEWIFE- S LIBRARY. 

No. 3. — The Chuck Ribs, also used for roasting, but of a 
less desirable quality and usually sold at a lower price. 

No. 4. — The neck, with considerable bone, used generally 
for stewing and for pot roast. 

No. 5. — The Cheek, or jowl, a fleshy part, used for stew- 
ing or for boiling. 

No. 6. — The Rump, sometimes cut differently from the 
manner shown in the diagram, which is theusual cutting at 
the East, for domestic purposes. This part has very little 
bone and is generally used for choice steaks, and the por- 
tion next the tail, left from the steak cutting, is a choice 
piece for corning. 

No. 7. — The Pin-bone, a choice piece for roasting, being 
very tender. 

No. 8. — The Round, which furnishes common steaks, and 
is the choice cut for dried beef or for corning. 

No. 9. — The Leg, the choice soup piece. 

No. 10. — The Shin, also used for soup. 

No. II. — The T/wwyfaw;^, used for boiling and for corning. 

No. 12. — The Brisket, used for corning. 

No. 13. — The Plate, used for family boiling and for 
corning. 

No. 14. — The Plate (thick end), extending under the 
shoulder, used for corning and family boiling. 

No. 15. — The Breast, or butt end of the brisket, also 
called the " sticking piece." Used for corning and souj>- 
meat. 

If the cutting vary materially from this plan, it is still 
true that the essential parts of the animal continue to exist 
and are for sale under some name and in some shape. A 
polite inquiry of any reputable butcher will secure the 
desired information as to any part. By this means a person 
may secure intelligent skill in purchasing beef Some spe- 
cial points concerning beef need a moment's attention. 

The Tongue is used fresh, salted, or smoked. It is a very 



MARKETING. 



307 



desirable and delicate portion, suitable for table use at almost 
any time. The Tail, which affords some meat and much 
gelatinous substance, is prized for soups, ox-tail soup espe- 
cially being founded upon it. The Heart and Liver are used 
for food — the former being stuffed and roasted, the latter 
being fried, usually with onions. The Tripe, which is the 
lining of the large, or receiving stomach of the beef, is used 
for souse, for pepper-pot, etc. It is a cheap article. The 
Kidneys of beef are sold separate from the sirloin, from 
which they are cut. They are used for stewing, etc. Suet, 
used for pie-crust, plum-puddings, mince-meat, etc., is the 
solid, clear fat, which incloses the kidney. When pure it 
is a very desirable article. The Feet are used for jellies, 
though not so delicate as the calf's foot. The Head is refuse. 
The Marrow-bones are those of the shin, leg, and round. 
Any of the round, hollow bones contain marrow. The 
othe'r remains of beef are refuse, except as available for 
manufacturing purposes. 

VEAL. 
Veal is a favorite meat. Consult the points concerning it 
made upon page 76. Veal is cut as shown below. 

No. I. — Loin, the best end. It is the favorite roasting 
piece, and furnishes the 
choice chops. It com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — Fillet, ox cw'iS.&t 
piece. This too is a 
choice part, being excel- 
lent for steaks and for 
roasting and filling. It 
is also very fine for a cold 
cut. 

No. 3. — The Leg, call- 
ed knuckle also, used chiefly for stewing and for soup. 
No. 4. — The Rack, used for chops, and for roasting ; less 
20

OF VEAL. 



308 "^^JP- HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

desirable and lower priced than the loin, having more 
bone. 

No. 5. — The Neck, used for stewing, pies, etc. The best 
end is quite desirable, that nearer the head being of less 
value. 

No. 6. — Head. The brains and tongue are prized by many, 
the former for frying as a delicacy, the latter for boiling. 
The head, as a whole, is used in mock turtle and some other 
fancy soups. 

No. 7. — The SJumlder, used for roasting, for which it 
answers a good purpose. It is valuable for a stew also. 

No. 8. — The Breast. This is the. second choice piece for 

stuffing and roasting. It is too valuable for pies, stews, etc. 

No. 9. — The Shiit. This usually goes with the shoulder, 

with which it is often roasted. If used separately, it answers 

fairly wdl for stewing. 

The Sweetbread, a very delicate portion, belongs with the 
breast. It is often sold separately, however. The Kidneys 
are sold with the loin, in the fat of which they are imbedded. 
The Heart and Liver are great delicacies for frying, or the 
heart for stuffing and roasting. The Feet are the basis of 
genuine calves-foot jelly, and are much prized for this pur- 
pose. The Entrails, cut open and well cleaned, are made 
into souse by some persons. 

MUTTON. 
Next to beef, the most profitable and healthful meat is 
mutton. In all markets this meat is cut substantially in the 
same manner as shown in the following chart. The names 
and ordinary uses of the parts are as follows : 

No. I. — The Loin, best end. This is the choice piece for 
filling and roasting and for prime chops. Of course, it com- 
mands the best price. 

No.. 2. — The Leg. This joint is nearly always used for 
roasting and chops, sometimes also for boiling. It has but 
little bone, as compared with tlie other parts of the animal, 



MARKETING. 3O9 

and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the 
price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It 
is common to find a good leg weighing from seven to twelve 
pounds. 

No. 3. — The Loin, second choice. This furnishes " French 




CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF MUTTON. 

chops," a favorite dish in eating-houses, and is specially 
good for a roast. 

No. 4. — The Loin, rump end. Good for roasting and 
boiling. It contains considerable bone. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder, used for boiling and for filling and 
roasting. It is less in price and nearly as good as the leg, 
but it has more bone. 

No. 6. — The Breast, used for stews and for meat pies. A 
savory, juicy part. 

No. 7. — The Flank. A continuation of the breast, but 
somewhat thinner. This with the breast makes a cheap 
roast, which may be split and filled. 

No. 8. — The Rack. The best end of the rack is used for 
second-rate chops. The neck end of the rack is good for 
stewing only. 

No. 9. — The Neck. This, with the neck end of the rack, 
is for stewing only. 



310 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



No. 10. — The Head. The tongue only is used, the re- 
mainder being refuse. 

It is customary to split mutton down the back, and then 
to split each half into parts called hind and fore quarters. 
The saddle is the middle portion before this quartering is 
done. Part of it goes with each quarter. 

The hind quarter of mutton, consisting of the leg and 
the loin, is the choice quarter. It makes a very superior 
large roast, while either of its parts, the leg or the loin, suf- 
fices nicely for a small company. A hind quarter from an 
animal in good condition will weigh from twenty to thirty 
pounds. The Kidneys are used as in beef, so also the heart 
and liver. The other parts are refuse. 

LAMB. 
Lamb is cut as mutton, but it is usually dressed with 
more care, so as to present a more attractive appearance. 
Lamb proper is in market in the spring only. As the sea- 
son advances older lamb is in market, but what is called 
"lamb" in the winter months is usually poor mutton 
dressed lamb style. The butcher indulges in a quiet smile 
when his customer, in the winter season, asks for and pays 
for " lamb." Of course, the superiority and rarity of lamb 

demand for it the best 
prices. Indeed, " fancy 
prices " reign in lamb. 
For tests, see p. 82. 
PORK. 
Fresh pork and salt 
pork are much used. 
General facts on pork 
are given on page 85. 
The usual method of cutting for domestic use is shown in 
the accompanying cut. For packing a somewhat different 
.method is pursued. 
No. I. — The Ham, the most valuable part of the hog. 




CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF 
PORK. 



MARKETING. 311 

When nicely cured it is a very great delicacy. It is a great 
article of commerce also. 

'No. 2 . — Sirloin, furnishing chops and the finest roast- 
ing pieces. 

No. 3. — Rack, used for second-rate chops and roasts, 
the meat being as sweet, but the bone being greater than in 
the sirloin. 

No. 4. — Neck, used for inferior roasting, and for boiling 
when fresh, and also for corning. 

No. 5. — The Shoulder. A fair roasting piece, but chiefly 
used, like the ham, for pickling and curing, though it is 
greatly inferior to ham in juiciness and flavor. Either fresh 
or corned it is a fine boiling piece. 

No. 6. — The Jowl. Useful for smoking. Sometimes cured 
with the tongues remaining in them. 

No. 7. — The Head.^ Used for puddings and head cheese. 

No. 8. — The Belly or Flitch. A good boiling piece either 
fresh, salted, or smoked. 

No. 9. — Feet. These are much used for souse and for 
pickling. They contain so much gelatinous matter that they 
are exceedingly desirable. 

The Ears also are used for souse and head cheese. The 
Liver, Heart, and Kidneys are used for liver pudding. The 
Entrails, nicely cleaned, are used for sausage skins. The Fat 
about the kidneys furnishes leaf lard. The other fat fur- 
nishes common lard. The other parts are refuse. 

VENISON. 

If the marketer desires venison, it is well to remember 
that buck venison is best from August ist to November ist; 
and that doe venison is best from the latter date to January 
1st, after which no deer should be killed. It is quite com- 
mon, however, to freeze deer meat, and to keep it for months 
in that state. This adds to the cost, but it also improves 
the fibre of the meat. 

Venison is cut into parts respectively designated haunchj 



312 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR V. 

saddle, leg, loin, fore-quarter, and steaks. The latter should 
not be cut until ready for use. Venison should be fat. It 
cannot be too fat. Its flavor is better after hanging a few 
days, but it should not become rank. To test this, pierce it 
with a skewer and notice the odor. Shun tough venison. 

For roasting, choose the haunch, the saddle, the neck, or 
the shoulder. Cut steaks from the leg. Stew the shoulder, 
or any part which is too thin for satisfactory roasting. 
POULTRY. 

Tests of poultry are given on page 6l. But the expe- 
dients resorted to in order to mislead purchasers are so 
numerous that even experts are not wholly safe. Techni- 
cally, the term chickens belongs to ifowls under a year old, 
but actually, the entire tribe is included in the name. Capons 
are young roosters, gelded and carefully fed so as to secure 
the utmost delicacy of flesh. Pullets are young hens. 

Turkeys reach their maturity in eight or nine months, 
and hence young, but well-grown turkeys, are in market 
about the fall and winter holidays. Young hen turkeys are 
regarded as best, being fatter and more juicy ; but the male 
turkeys will be larger for the same age. The legs of young 
turkeys are black ; of old ones reddish and rough. Young 
cocks have small spurs; old ones large spurs and very 
rough legs. Fat turkeys, with broad, full breasts, are pre- 
ferable. Soft, pliable feet indicate fresh-killed birds. 

Wild turkeys are deemed to be finer in flavor than tame 
ones. They are in season in November, December, and 
January. They are usually sold with their feathers on. 
Srnall birds have their well-defined seasons, as have other 
kinds of game, but they admit little choice except as fresh. 
VEGETABLES. 

Every good marketer will supply his table with a variety 
of vegetables all the year round. There is hardly a vege- 
table that cannot be had in our markets at any season, 
either fresh or canned. Railroads and steamers connect the 



MARKETING. 313 

different climates so closely that one hardly knows whether 
he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of their natural 
season. But it takes a long purse to buy fresh vegetables 
at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are 
so many vegetables that keep through cold weather that if 
we did not have new ones from the South, there would be, 
nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. Late in the 
spring, when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow 
rank, we greatly appreciate what comes from the South. 

If one has a good, dry cellar, it is wise to procure in the 
fall vegetables enough for all winter. But if the cellar is 
warm, vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold 
months have passed. Those best adapted for winter keep- 
ing are onions, squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, 
cabbages, and potatoes. Squashes and onions should be 
kept in a very dry room. The others will keep readily in a 
cool, dry cellar, or bedded in sand beneath the reach of frost. 

If vegetables be bought as needed, care must be used to 
get them in good condition. In season, they should never 
appear wilted, but should be fresh and crisp. At no time 
should they be used if suffering from decay. The utmost 
prudence is needed at this point. A very little waste will 
more than counterbalance all you save by purchasing large 
quantities, and by storing for the winter. 

The luxuries or the world are spread at the feet of the 
customer in our markets ; still, extravagant expenditure is 
by no means necessary. Many delicacies are within the 
reach of all. Those who content themselves with sending to 
the markets, miss many golden opportunities. Those who go, 
see for themselves, and embrace many a favoring chance. 
Personal observation ripens into experience , also, and the 
experienced purchasers command the situation. 

These remarks apply with equal force to purchasing of 
the grocer, the baker, the milkman, and all, in short, who 
supolv us with the necessaries of life. There are reliable 



314 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

dealers and those of doubtful integrity; but in every case 
the hope of the household is in its provider. Cultivate 
power in this line. 

It is best to deal steadily with persons whom you have 
tried and found reliable. Do not relinquish your indepen- 
dence, so as to suggest to them the idea that they may im- 
pose on you. Be ready to go elsewhere, if the old service 
falls off; but usually those who are regular dealers at a 
place get the best attention, and errors or failures can be 
rectified with ease. 

In all marketing and dealing with storekeepers keep your 
temper. To lose one's temper and scold or threaten, is un- 
dignified and worse than useless. State your grievances 
calmly and plainly. If they are redressed, all right ; if not 
redressed, you can quietly go elsewhere and bestow your 
patronage. A little suspension of trade with a dealer often 
works wonders. He does not want to lose customers ; but 
such is the waywardness of human nature, that all of us 
need reminders to keep us fully up to duty. Let the dealer 
have these when he needs them, but never at the expense 
of your own self-possession and courteous dignity. 



II.— CARVING. I 

THE ART OF CARVING J REQUISITES ; CARVING TURKEY, CHICKEN, 
DUCKS, GEESE, SMALL BIRDS, BEEF, MUTTON, LAMB, VENISON, 
HAM, PIG, RABBIT, STEAKS, FISH, TONGUE, AND CALf's-HEAD. 

EVERY person who travels or visits much sees number- 
less illustrations of the varied capacities of carvers. 
Hotel and restaurant life does not make much display 
in this line, as the carving is done out of sight. And yet 
even here the marvelous thinness of the slice, which is so 
immense in its area, demonstrates that somebody is on hand 
who is expert in this line. In private houses the meat and 
the poultry are sometimes carved before they come to the 
table. Bv whom done, or with what accompaniments of per- 
spiration and emphatic words, the guests know not. But 
meat served thus is chilled and juiceless, and generally dam- 
aged. It is worthy of better treatment. 

Many amusing and not a few irritating examples of 
clumsy carving occur under everybody's eyes. Meat is con- 
demned as tough, knives as dull, dishes as too small, there 
is too much gravy, skewers are not drawn, and a thousand 
other reasons are blurted out by the clumsy carver, as he 
outwardly sweats and inwardly swears at his task. He slops 
gravy on to the cloth ; he drops part of the meat from the 
dish ; he cuts himself by an unfortunate slip of the knife ; 
and sometimes, like a distinguished wit of whom the story 
tells, he lands a fowl in the lap of a lady beside him, 
though probably, unlike that wit, he will not have the grace 
to say, " I will thank you, madam, to return that chicken." 

Every housekeeper should learn to carve. Carving should 
be done at the table by the gentleman of the house, or, in his 

315 



316 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

absence, by the lady, unless some other of the family be an 
expert carver. Unless a guest is known to be an expert, or 
unless he volunteers for the duty, he should not be expected 
to carve. He may be a clumsy hand, and the courtesy of 
hospitality should protect him from exposure at this point. 

The carver at a private table should retain his seat while 
carving and serving. To facilitate this, his chair should be 
high, so that he can reach readily to his work. The dish 
should be large enough to prevent soiling the cloth, except 
by some unusual accident. The centre of a cai-ving-dish for 
roast meats should be raised nearly as high as the surround- 
ing edge, so that a horizontal movement of the knife in slicing 
may be made without interference from the edges. No man 
can slice meat neatly if the meat is in the bottom of a deep 
dish, into which he must scoop with his knife as best he 
may. Elevate the meat, but have a surrounding depression 
between the centre and the edge, where the rich juices of the 
meat may accumulate, and where they may be served readily. 

Not all knives are suitable for carving, nor is any one knife 
just the thing for all work in this line. For slicing, a long, 
thin, broad blade is essential. With a fine roast, elevated on 
the dish, and with a good, sharp slicing knife in hand, a 
cool-headed man can hardly help doing neat and rapid work. 

But such a knife is not the one for poultry or rib carving. 
For these uses a shorter blade, which is both narrower and 
stiffer, must be employed. All knives for carving must be 
sharp. There should be a good steel at hand to touch up 
the edge — nothing more, for a dull knife should be ground, 
or whet up on an oil-stone. Any large fork, with a guard 
to prevent accidents, will do. A rest for the knife and fork 
when not in use is desirable. The carver's requisites, there- 
fore, are as follows : A high chair, suitable serving plates, 
two sharp knives, a good fork, and a knife and fork rest. 
With these he is ready for work. Without them he is at 
serious disadvantage. 




CARVING. 317 

Carving a Turkey. — Nothing delights an expert carver 
more than the opportunity to cut up a fine roast turkey. 
Such a man is in doubt whether the eating of the meat even 
is the greater luxury. 

Whether the head of the bird shall lie to the carver's 
right or left is an open question. Better to the right, -as 
more work is required on the head end, and in this position 
the knife-hand works less over the hand which holds the 
fork. 

The fork should be inserted astride of the breast-bone, 
just back of its most promi- 
nent point. It should be 
sunk deep enough to pene- 
trate the encasing bone be- 
low the white meat. This 
secures full command of the 

bird. If the company be turkey properly trussed for 
small and the bird fairly roasting. 

large, better do all the cutting from one side, reserving the 
other in as perfect a form as possible. 

Remove all the limbs first unless half the bird is to be 
reserved. The neat cut is to remove each drum-stick, or 
lower leg, by a single stroke of the knife, which must ex- 
actly hit the joint. To remove the thigh, or upper leg 
joint, make a V-shaped cut, wide enough at the point whence 
the drum-stick has been cut to include all the meat, but 
converging at the joint, which can always be distinctly seen 
near the back. Two strokes of the knife do this work, each 
of them cutting down to the carcase. A slight outward 
pressure of the knife-blade, applied between the carcase and 
the upper point of the thigh joint, will cause it to drop 
off neatly on the plate. Outside the lines of these cuts, flakes 
of dark meat will remain adhering to the carcase, which 
should now be cut off They help to meet demands for 
dark meat. 



318 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

In carving the wings, the neat stroke removes the lower 
part, which contains the two bones, by cutting at the inner 
part of the joint, and so turning the blade of the knife as 
to throw that part off in the direction opposite to its natural 
movement. The first joint of each wing then follows, the 
cut being deep enough to fully reach the ball and socket 
joint. A slight motion of the pinion toward the head of the 
bird will suffice usually to detach this part. If it does not, 
the point of the knife may be thrust into the socket of the 
joint to sever the cartilage. This will free it. 

When this dismembering is accomplished, proceed to 
slice the breast meat in thin, broad slices. Clean off all the 
white meat, unless part only is needed. Placing your knife 
close to the front of the breast-bone, and cutting toward the 
neck, you will dislodge the V-shaped bone, corresponding 
to the " merrythought " or " pull-bone " of chickens. To 
dislodge the collar-bones is to many a hard task. But cut 
thte cartilages which bind them to the frame of the bird. 
These cartilages are in the cavity between the neck and the 
breast-bone. Through this cavity, thrust your knife out-' 
wardly under one of these bones ; make a fulcrum of the 
front part of breast-bone, and a lever of the knife, its edge 
resting on the fulcrum. You can then easily pry up the 
troublesome bone and turn it off to' the side. This move- 
ment takes the bone at the best mechanical advantage. It 
must come, and come at once, if this movement be made. 

Now attend to the other end of the bird. Shave off all 
superfluous meat from the carcase. Turn the carcase on its 
side, the back toward you. Insert your knife beside the oil- 
bag and thrust it forward parallel to the spine. It will cut 
its way very easily. A slight outward movement of the 
knife will then throw off these side bones, which are choice 
pieces, yielding the juiciest of the dark meat. The ribs 
may now be cut through with ease from front to rear, about 
midway from breast to back. The breast-bone is incapable 



CARVING. 319 

of further division, but the back easily divides into six parts. 
Turn it back up and hold with the fork ; separate the oil- 
bag, about an inch of the spine with it ; lift the rv -p, 
projecting spine with the knife back and it will A pv

one way only to succeed in this art. The anatomy ^^^^ iib p'of- 
of the turkey or chicken, or any other animal, must ''°''- 
be carefully studied. Do it in this way. Whenever a tur- 
key is brought into your house and is made ready for the 
roasting, place it on its back, as it will lie on the plate when 
it comes to the table. Carefully manipulate it, and note 
exactly where every joint lies. Imagine yourself about to 
carve it. Where would you put the knife to throw off that 
drum-stick ? How would you cut to throw off the thigh 
bone. Read the preceding directions ; apply them in fancy 
to the bird as you see and handle it ; then carry it all out at 
the table when the bird is cooked. 

No surgeon could do his work except he had thus prac- 
ticed on actual subjects in dissection. He must know by 
actual trial just what to do and how to do it. So must the 
carver know. Chickens, ducks, geese, small birds, meat, 
roasting pigs, every article, in short, which he expects to carve 
must be understood beforehand; then success will be his.

Carving Roast Chicken. — The same course precisely as has 
been prescribed for carving turkey must 
be followed with chickens. The only 
difference is in the formation of the 
" pull-bone " or " merrythought," but 
this makes no difference whatever in the 
cutting of the bird.

Carving Roast Ducks and Geese. — These 
are more difficult than turkey or chick- 
ens, for the reason that they are constitu- 
tionally more sinewy in the joints and 
they have fer less flesh proportionately. 

They are barrel-shaped, 
with thin layers of meat 
instead of the fine 
masses of flesh found 
on the turkey or on fine 
chickens. The leg joints 
lie farther to the rear, 
and higher on the side 
than in land fowls. They are not so easily reached, therefore. 
Their anatomy must be 
studied, however. It is the 
only way to obtain com- 
mand of the carcase. In 
carving, dismember Ihe 
bird as in other cases. 
Then cut the meat in long, 
narrow strips, along the 
sides and breast of the bird, 
and use these as the choice 
cuts. The legs and wings 
may be given out if desired or if the supply be short. Duck 
is but a side dish, however ; it is supposed to be served with

other dishes, and so to be served lightly. Goose is some- 
times the main piece, but not often so at elaborate feasts. 

Carving Broiled Chickens. — Chickens for broiling are pre- 
sumably young and tender. If not, thorough steaming before 
they are broiled will do something for them. They are 
trussed in such shape usually that joints are not easily 
struck. But study the bird when trussed. See where joints 
do lie and cut them. If the birds are really young and ten- 
der, however, they may be halved or quartered, cutting 
through the bones directly and so serving them. 

Camng Smaller Birds. — Smaller 
birds which need carving, may 
simply be split longitudinally, just 
beside the breast-bone and the 
spine. Their bones can be cut 
easily. This will apply to pigeon, 
partridge, prairie hen, pheasant, smaller bird properly

etc. 

Carving Roast Beet — Pieces of roast beef vary so that no 
one rule covers all. A safe general direction, however, is 
to study carefully just what is in the piece before it is 
cooked. ■ Know your meat before you attempt to carve it. 
Another general rule, applicable to all meats indeed, is to 
cut across the grain in all cases. Meat cut with the grain 
is stringy and fibrous. If cut across the grain, all the longi- 
tudinal flakes of flesh and the minute sinews are cut so 
short that any toughness existing in them is wholly con- 
cealed. The first slice, by this process, will always be a 
brown, outside cut. Slices should always be thin, but not 
so as to seem ragged. In carving ribs of beef the knife 
may be thrust along close to the ribs, so as to separate the 
meat from them. The cuts then made across the grain will 
separate the slices with ease, and neatness. Never cut beef 
across the bone. It is the easiest way, but also the poorest 



322

Carving Roasts of Mutton — A leg -of mutton is carved as a 
ham, by cutting down to the bone, from the outer edge, 
making the cuts converge on the bone, so freeing each shce 
as it is cut. 

A shoulder of mutton should be carved as the leg. In 
each case, when the choice cuts are exhausted, clip off the 
remaining meat as best you can, always across the grain. 

Saddle of mutton is carved in several ways: ist, in longi- 
tudinal slices along the backbone ; 2d, by transverse slices, 
each taking in a rib, which makes thick and clumsy por- 
tions ; 3d, by oblique slices, not taking in the bones, but 
forming a slight angle with them. The latter method is 
deemed preferable by most carvers. 

In all roasts which include the ribs the backbone should 

be well and cleanly cut through by the butcher, between every 

pair of ribs. Otherwise no satisfactory carving can be done. 

Carviag Roasts of Lamb. — The cut shows a fore-quarter of 

lamb with its outer side uppermost. This joint is first to 

be cut so as to divide the 
shoulder from the rest of 
the quarter, which is called 
the target. For , this pur- 
pose, put the fork firmly 
into the shoulder joint, and 
then cut underneath the 
blade-bone, beginning at a, 
F0RIX2UARTER OF LAMB. ^^^ continue cutting all 

around in the direction of the circular line, and pretty close 
to the under part of the blade-bone. Some cut the shoulder 
large, while others take off no more meat with it than is 
barely necessary to remove the blade-bone. It is most con- 
venient to place the shoulder on a separate dish. This is 
carved in the same way as the shoulder of mutton. When 
the shoulder is removed, a lemon may be squeezed over 
that part of the remainder of the joint where the knife has

passed ; this gives a flavor to the meat which is generally- 
approved. Then proceed to cut completely through from 
b to c, following the line across the bones as cracked by the 
butcher, and this will divide the ribs {d) from the brisket (e). 
Tastes vary in giving preference to the ribs or the brisket. 

Other parts of lamb are carved as mutton. The fat is 
very delicate and should be served to all the guests. 

Carvmg Roasts of Venison. — These resemble roasts of 
mutton so closely that no different directions for their carv- 
ing need be given. 

Carving Ham. — Boiled or baked ham may be served either 
side up. The inner edge of the ham, which lay adjacent to 
the body, is rather more tender than the edge, which lay 
toward the tail. Slices should be cut directly from the edge 
to the bone, cutting out the middle portions first. Let the 
cuts converge upon the bone every time, so that each slice 
is set free at once. When the choice cuts are gone, trim up 
the remaining parts neatly as possible, and always across 
the grain. The knuckle end of a ham furnishes the leaner 
and drier cuts. Some prefer carving hams with a more 
slanting cut, rather than a direct, right-angled cut upon the 
bone, beginning at the thick end, and so continuing through- 
out. This mode is, however, apt to be very wasteful, unless 
the carver be careful to take away both fat and lean in due 
proportion. 

Carving Roast Pig. — The cut below represents a pig roasted 
whole and served in the most 
approved style. Many, how- 
ever, separate the head before 
serving, and garnish the body 
with the ears, jaw, etc. The 
head may be severed by a 
neat cut around the neck, and a little sideward motion, but 
this is not necessary, as the cheek or jaw can be removed 
21

without removing the head. The shoulder should then be 
taken off from the body, by passing the knife under it in a 
circular direction, and the leg separated as shown in the 
line d, e,f. The ribs may then be divided into two or more 
parts, helping at the same time an ear or jaw with it, with 
some of the sauce also. Pieces may be cut from the legs 
and shoulders. Some consider the neck end the finest part, 
while others give the ribs the preference. 

Carviiig Roast Rabbit. — Begin by cutting longitudinally 
from head to tail near to the backbone, then make a corres- 
ponding cut on the other side of the backbone, leaving the 
back and the head in one distinct piece. Cut off the legs 
at the hip-joint, and take off the wing, or fore leg, nearly as 
you would the wing of a bird, carrying the knife round in a 

circular line. The ribs 
are of little importance, 
as they are bare of meat. 
Divide the back into 
three or four equal por- 
tions. The head is then 
to be cut off] and the 
lower jaw divided from

the upper part of the 
head in the middle, you have the brains, which are prized 
by epicures. The comparative goodness of different parts 
of a rabbit will depend much on the age, and also upon 
the cooking. The back and the legs are always the best 
parts. 

Carving Steaks, etc. — Where there is a tenderloin in a 
beefsteak, it should be divided among the party with the 
other portion. If there are too many persons to allow each 
a share, give ladies and guests the preference. Epicures eat 
the tenderloin at the last. As a bright boy said, " You 




CARVING. 325 

ought always to eat the best last ; then you feel as if you 
have had all best." 

Carving Fish. — This is more a serving than a carving. 
The meat of fish is usually so tender that cutting is unne- 
cessary. Skillful separation of the flakes is what is needed. 

A silver knife, or fish slice, and a silver fish fork, broad 
at the tines, are desirable. Steel tools impart a disagreeable 
odor to fish. Fish should be served in neat, unbroken por- 
tions, never in scraps and bits. 

In many kinds of fish the backbone may be taken out 
entire, as in all the mackerel family as served for the table. 
This is a neat proceeding for company ; but for home uses 
the backbone is preferred with the fish, because of the 
very savory morsels which adhere to it. 

The skin and fins of the turbot are regarded as very deli- 
cate. It, therefore, should be split along the backbone, at 
its side, and then cut into cross sections so that part of a fin 
shall go with each portion. This is the neatest method of 
serving. 

Caxviag Tongue.— The juicy and fatter part of the tongue 
is at its thick end or root. Some prefer the smaller and 
drier end, however. If the whole tongue is not likely to be 
needed, cut off its tip in one piece, and on the main portion 
work backward toward the butt end. Do not cut squarely 
across, as it leaves the slices unduly small ; but cut on an 
angle, so doubling the area of the slices. 

Carving a Calfs Head. — Cut the external meat in strips 
from the nose to the back of the head. Some deem the eye 
a delicacy. It may be removed with the point of the knife, if 
requested, but do not puncture it with the fork or the knife. 
The palate is a choice part. It may be cut from under the 
head, with its surrounding parts, all of which are delicate 
morsels. The jawbone may be removed also, and will dis- 
close fine meat. 



III.— SERVING MEALS. 

METHODS OF SERVING MEALS; RUSSIAN, ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND 
AMERICAN styles; TABLES, TABLE-CLOTHS, NAPKINS, AND 
DECORATIONS ; FINGER-BOWLS J DUE CEREMONY J WHAT TO 
avoid; GARNISHES; ROYAL DISPLAYS. 

METHODS of serving meals differ widely. The items 
of conveniences and pecuniary ability always become 
important elements in the case. Taste, too, enters 
largely into it. Some people need the formal and the cere- 
monious. Others despise these and prefer the free-and-easy 
plan. There are national methods also, which largely rule 
among the refined and elegant. 

One of these methods, the Russian, decorates the centre 
of the table elaborately with flowers, and surrounds it at the 
outset with the dessert tastefully displayed. This secures a 
delightsome central object. The several dishes are, then 
brought to the table carved and ready for use, each dish 
being served as a separate course, one vegetable only being 
allowed to appear with it. 

The English method sets the whole of each course at 
once, no matter how many dishes it may contain. This, it 
is objected, allows the dishes to cool, and one often vitiates 
another. The dishes which require carving are by this 
method first placed on the table, and then removed to a 
side table for cutting and serving. 

The French method serves everything as a separate 
course, even each vegetable, unless it be simply a garnish 
for another dish. The American plan, however, serves at 
least one vegetable with each substantial dish. At the 
more formal meals among us, carving is done at the side 
tables, but in the genuine home dinners the work is done at

the table by the host himself. If, however, he cannot do 
the honors of the serving with ease, let the work be done 
by another, at the side table. 

When the general plan of the dinner management is set- 
tled, those who are to do the various parts of the work 
must be thoroughly instructed. A servant not sufficiently 
intelligent to learn the required part well, and to do it pro- 
perly, is too stupid for satisfactory service with company or 
at a purely family gathering. 

Square end tables are now the proper style. They should 
be sufficiently roomy to wholly avoid crowding. A spot- 
lessly white table-cloth should be spread, with another 
under it to deaden sound and make a softer appearance. 
The cloth should not be very stiffly starched, but it should 
be nicely polished and beautifully glossy. It should hang 
two feet from the top edge, the corners gathered up, if needs 
be, to prevent their drooping on the floor. Napkins should 
be large and heavy. Such texture does not need much 
starch. The glass and silverware should be perfect in 
brightness. It may be of inexpensive kind, but it must be 
scrupulously clean. 

Colored table-cloths of ornamental patterns are allowable 
for luncheon or tea. They are not in place where hot meats 
are served. Nor are colored napkins. Too often these 
deep tinted articles are used "to save washing," which 
means " to conceal dirt." Not unfrequently covers and nap^ 
kins of this kind are kept in use when their rank odor cries 
out for the wash-tub, even though their soiled appearance 
does not. The doily, or D'Oiley,SiS some will have it from 
the proper name of its first reputed maker, is a small, colored 
napkin used with fruits and wines. Stains will not show so 
readily upon these, but they must always be scrupulously 
fresh and clean. To conceal filth under rich coloring is 
sacrilege of the worst sort, but to bring it to the table, and 
ask guests to wipe their lips with it, is a crime. 



328 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

A great variety of ornaments and adornments are admis- 
sible on a table, but nothing is so pure and so appropriate 
as a handsome display of ferns or flowers. The flowers 
should not be just such as ladies wear so profusely and so 
beautifully in their belts and on their dresses. Larger blooms 
are preferable for the table, especially those of the pure white 
and fine texture belonging to the lily family. 

It is quite the proper and beautiful thing to place a neat 
bouquet beside each plate, in tasteful bouquet-holders. For 
gentlemen the little bunching suitable for the button-hole is 
desirable. For ladies the belt bouquet will meet the case. 
The floral centre-piece may be composed of small bouquets, , 
which at the end of the meal may be distributed. 

Fruit pieces and handsome confectionery pieces may be 
disposed to advantage in ornamenting the table. Tasty 
folding of spotless napkins is so important a decoration that 
the subject will be treated fully farther on. These may be 
perched in polished goblets, while bouquets, or small rolls 
of bread nestle amid their snowy folds. Little arts like 
these embellish a table, and delight the guests. 

But these embellishments must not be overdone. What 
will be correct for a large table will be too much for a small 
one, and what will be just right for a small table will look 
thin and meagre on a large one. Study the proprieties of 
every occasion. What suits once does not suit forever. 

Embellishments may be liberally bestowed upon the din- 
ing-room itself. In addition to its permanent decorations, 
flowers are always admissible. At the great ball on March 
20th, 1883, at the Vanderbilt Mansion in New York, the 
decorations of the supper-room were absolutely regal. The 
walls were completely hidden with palms and ferns, from 
which a countless number of orchids were suspended. Two 
large fountains were introduced into the far corners of the 
room. The doors of the main entrance to the supper-room 
were in an open position and were completely covered with 



SERVING MEALS. 329 

roses and lilies of the valley. In the centre of the room a 
large palm towered almost to the ceiling, and about it from 
the dome was suspended an immense Bougen Villa vine, the 
tendrils of which drooped in bunches from the branches of 
the palm. Throughout the room there were many stands 
and vases filled with flowers, the entire effect more 
resembling fairyland than an earthly home. Few can rival 
such a display, of course, but all enjoy at least a pen-peep 
upon such princely splendor. 

No ornament should be so large as to obscure to any 
great extent a view of the entire table, or to conceal any of 
its guests. As many knives, forks, and spoons as will be 
needed for the various courses may be placed at each plate, 
though, to avoid the display of so much cutlery, a better 
style is to supply these accessories as needed. Goblets and 
wine-glasses, if the latter be used, should be on the table at 
the start. Large spoons, with salt and pepper casters, 
should be on the table also. The dessert-plates, finger- 
bowls, etc., should stand ready on the sideboard, awaiting 
the time when they shall be needed. The hot closet should 
be well stocked with dishes needing to be used warm. 

Finger-bowls should be half filled with water. In Paris they 
are served with warm water scented with peppermint. A 
slice of lemon in cold water answers the purpose entirely, as 
it removes any grease from fingers or lips. A geranium 
leaf may floot in the water. Its fragrance on the fingers, if 
it be pressed, will be agreeable. It is customary to place a 
fruit napkin, or doily, on the dish on which the finger-bowl 
rests, to avoid the rattle of the bowl, and to protect the dish 
from injury if it be highly ornamented. Little openworked 
mats will, however, answer better. Do not summon your 
company to dinner by a bell. Country hotels and cheap 
boarding-houses may do that, but not a refined home, espe- 
cially when guests are present. 

Soup is dished by the lady of the house at a home dinner. 



330 THE HOUSEWIFE-' S LIBRARY. 

Meat is cut and dished by the gentleman of the house. 
Vegetables, bread, butter, water, etc., are served by the 
waiter, dessert by the hostess, except in the case of melons, 
requiring to be cut at the table, which is the work of the 
host. 

Home meals should all be sufficiently ceremonious to 
dispense with haste and confusion. On the other hand, they 
should not run into stiffness and frigidity. Bright, cheery, 
pleasant chat should enliven every meal. If the leading dish 
be nothing but hash, let it be served in good style and amid 
a profusion of genial, social sunshine. 

What to Avoid. 

1st. — Never use table-linen which is open to the suspicion 
of being soiled. The napkin-ring business is of question- 
able propriety. Why not, as at hotels, furnish a clean nap- 
kin to each person at every meal ? 

2d. — Crockery with an abundance of nicks and splints 
and cracks is not unsightly merely, but, where the glazing 
is broken, the porous material absorbs grease and dish water, 
making these spots dense with unsavory and unwholesome 
matter. 

3d. — Partly emptied dishes become unsightly, and some- 
times positively repulsive. They look like refuse and scraps. 
At the great State dinners at the Tuileries, no guest saw a 
partly emptied dish. A full, beautifully garnished dish was 
presented for his approval, upon expressing which, his per- 
sonal plate was taken to a side table and supplied from 
another serving dish. 

4th. — An overloaded table or plate satiates appetite 
rather than stimulates it. A gracious expectancy of what 
is to come is a great help at the table. 

Sth. — A stinted supply is very discouraging. To the ap- 
prehension of a lack of food, the moral sense of mortification 
is added in this case. 



SERVIN-G MEALS. 331 

6th. — Beware of ill-assorted dinners or tea-parties. An 
occasion intended to be a pleasure is often a pest for lack of 
care in this regard. This caution applies to the selection of 
guests, and more strongly to the disposition of guests at the 
table. Secure fitness both in the viands presented and in 
the parties present. 

7th. — Do not inaugurate new features at a dinner party, 
unless you are sure you have the mastery of them, and that 
when done in a masterly way they will certainly prove 
agreeable. 

8th. — Beware of the delusion that hospitality is expressed 
by the weight of its beef and mutton, and the multitude and 
rarity of its viands. 

9th. — Have no meddlesome, noisy, or slovenly service. 
Waiters should be attired neatly, and should wear light 
shoes or slippers. They should take no part in the social 
proceedings, not so much, indeed, as to smile at the best 
things. On formal occasions the man-servant should wear 
a dress-coat, white vest, and white necktie. The maid- 
servant should be attired in a neat, inconspicuous dress, 
with spotless white apron. 

lOth. — Both haste and slowness should be shunned. At 
the finished French dinners, the courses will not average 
more than five minutes each. French waiters are marvel- 
ously expert, however, in removing and replacing dishes. 

Garnishes. 

Much of the attractiveness of a table depends on the 
garnishes, which arc added to certain dishes to embellish or 
beautify them. A few hints on this subject will be of value. 

Parsley is the almost universal garnish to all kinds o{ 
cold meat, poultry, fish, butter, cheese, etc. 

Horse-radish is the garnish for roast beef, and for fish in 
general ; for the latter, slices of lemon are sometimes laid 
alternately with heaps of horse-radish. 



332 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Slices of lemon for boiled fowl, turkey, and fish, and for 
roast veal and calf's head. 

Carrot in slices for boiled beef, hot or cold. They may 
be cut into ornamental forms if desired. 

Barberries, fresh or preserved, for game. 

Fried smelts for turbot. 

Red beet-root sliced for cold meat, boiled beef, and salt 
fish. 

Fried sausages or force-meat balls for roast turkey, capon, 
or fowl. 

Fennel for mackerel and salmon, whether fresh or pickled. 

Lobster coral and parsley for boiled fish. 

Currant jelly for game, also for custard or bread-pud- 
ding. 

Seville oranges in slices for wild ducks, widgeons, teal, 
and such game. 

Mint, either with or wfthout parsley, for roast lamb, 
whether hot or cold. 

Pickled gerkins, capers, or onions, for some boiled meats, 
stews, etc.

pig-

of a boiled ham, which side should lie uppermo.st on the 

serving dish. 

Sliced eggs, showing the white and yellow parts, for 
chicken salad. 

Sprays of celery top for salads, cold meats, etc. 

Royal Displays. 

A peep at some royal table displays is valuable as sug- 
gesting what may be done. Perhaps the grandest display 
ever made was by Baron Rothschild in honor of the last 
Napoleon when at the height of his power, some five years 
before his fall. The entertainment was given at Rothschild's 



SEUVnVG MEALS. 333 

regal pleasure-house of Ferri^res, thirty miles out of Paris. 
The cost of the out-door decorations alone exceeded 
^100,000. Workmen were put on the road in vast gangs, 
and had it prepared with asphaltum every inch of the way. 
Chinese lanterns and Bengal lights rendered it brilliant as 
day. Forests of new trees in full growth were set out 
wherever the roadside happened to be bare. The imperial 
carriage, which left the Tuileries at five o'clock p. m., passed 
through continuous masses of jubilant spectators. Wine 
and edibles were given by the Rothschilds' orders to all 
along the route who bore decorations of any sort. 

The chateau itself, which is as roomy as the Capitol at 
Washington, was a blaze of light and rich drapery. The din- 
ing-room and the feast were thus described in a leading 
journal : 

" It was ^;uch a scene as the mind conjures in Aladdin's 
palace, built by the slaves of the gold and jewel caves. At 
a vast height from the floor a narrow gallery runs around 
the chamber. From this were suspended folds of golden 
drapery, in which some legend of Bonapartist glory flashed 
out in jeweled letters. The walls were encrusted with 
treasures that the house of Rothschild had been centuries 
collecting. The tables were a mass of glittering gold, even 
to the candelabra. The dinner began at nine o'clock and 
was served by waiters in livery rivaling the imperial in 
sumptuousness. The knives and forks were of solid gold, 
and when the dinner was ended the head of the house 
solemnly directed them gathered together and in presence 
of the Emperor ordered them melted and the mass sent to 
the mint, declaring that, having been sanctified by imperial 
use, they should never be degraded to baser hands." 



IV.— THE BILL OF FARE. 

bills of fare needed; edibles in season ; what to have fos

BILLS OF fare. 

WHAT shall be served for a meal is in most homes a hap. 
hazard affair. Somebody wants a certain dish, or 
something happens to be in the house, or a huckster 
comes along offering a certain article at a low price, and so the 
diet for the day is determined. The religious customs of some 
persons decide the bill of fare for certain days, and so far their 
domestic management is controlled. Others, especially in 
cheap boarding-houses, have a bill of fare inflexible as the 
ancient laws of the Medes and Persians. You know when 
to look for that greasy vegetable soup, made out of — fortu- 
nately for the eater, he knows not what. Then comes cab- 
bage day — regular as the week revolves it comes ; and that 
beefsteak and onions — the house is odorous with it, and you 
are greeted with its fragrance as you clamber up the front 
steps. The desserts, too, are fearfully regular. Boiled rice, 
corn-starch pudding, huckleberry pie in its season, canned 
peaches both in season and out of season, apple pie or cus- 
tard pie — these, with a few more of the same family, march 
on in their ceaseless round with the same old sequence as 
the figures follow each other in a cheap puppet show. These 
are travesties on a bill of fare. They burlesque the menu. 

A housekeeper should plan out her table offerings with 
great care. Her dishes should suit the seasons. On a 
frosty day in midwinter substantial, well-seasoned food is 
needed. It renews a hungry man. It stays by him. It does 
him good. But the same dinner in midsummer will disgust 

334 



THE BILL OF I'AKE. 335 

rather than delight. On a hot, exhausting day, heavy soups, 
substantial meats, and rich desserts are out of harmony. 
Light meats, delicate vegetables, and cooling desserts are 
then in demand. 

Dishes .should suit the days of the week also. What can 
be furnished by one fire or wash-day or ironing-day is not 
the same as can be furnished conveniently on other days. 
The man who proposed dumplings for wash-day dessert be- 
cause they could be boiled in the same kettle with the 
clotlies was on the true line of progress, though his appli- 
cation was not a happy one. The idea is that harmony 
shall exist. The washing must not suffer for the dinner, 
nor the dinner for the washing. Plan the bill of fare to fit 
the movements of the domestic establishment. 

A third point to be gained by planning is unity in each 
meal. Some articles of food, delicious in themselves, are 
unpalatable, and even unwholesome, in combination. 
Cucumbers or beets and milk, fish and milk, lobster and 
ice-cream, are combinations of this class ; while peaches 
and cream, lamb and green peas, stewed chicken and waf- 
fles, catfish and coffee, are fitly wedded, and no man can 
put them asunder. To secure all the above-named happy 
coincidences and combinations is the mission of the well- 
digested bill of fare. 

Of course, the pocket controls many of these things. He 
who cannot have his turkey and venison and plum-pudding 
on Christmas day, may, nevertheless, find satisfactory chew- 
ing on his boiled goose, and savory garnishing in his sour- 
krout or cabbage. But the poorest meals will be the better, 
like the artist's colors, when " mixed with brains." Think 
and plan. How can these things be best done ? Settle that 
question and carry out your conclusion with a queenly 
grace. But be open for the teachings of experience. What 
does not work well be ready to change. Those who never 
change their plans are poor learners.

for ordinary use in the family ? To suggest answers to this 
question, standard bills of fare for each season are appended.

In many of the cities Tea has passed away. Late dinners 
are in order. Luncheon is served to those at home at mid- 
day, which includes a cold cut, bread and butter, cheese, a 
glass of milk or cup of tea, and possibly a light dessert. 



342 



THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 



A bowl of hot, light soup is very acceptable at luncheon 
also. Luncheons are sometimes made quite elaborate, and 
become very pleasant company occasions. 

Late suppers are served by some who have the late din- 
ners, but unless they sit up very much later, the practice 
must soon affect them very injuriously. For supper, or tea, 
given at the usual hours, say from six to eight o'clock, the 
bill of fare suggested for breakfast may serve in substance. 
The later the supper the lighter it should be. Strong tea 
or coffee should not be used near bed-time if sound sleep 
is desired. 

Specimen bills of fare are given below. They are in suit- 
able form for the hostess to follow, and also for the printer 
to follow if it be desired to produce either of them in type.

And now, what more on bills of fare does the good house- 
wife need? Possibly she needs some hints as to cold 
lunches for wash-days, house-cleaning times, and other days 
of extra work. She shall have a few such hints : 

PLAIN HOME LUNCHEONS. 

No. 1. — Cold corn-beef, nicely sliced ; baked potatoes ; 
bread, butter, and pickles. Dessert — mince pie and cheese. 

No. 2. — Chicken pie, baked potatoes ; rolled bread or bis- 
cuit. Dessert — cake and custard. 

No. 3. — First course : Raw oysters, with lemon and 
crackers. Second course : Cold veal, with jelly and Sara- 
toga potatoes, bread, and butter. Dessert — ^pie with cheese. 

No. 4. — Casserole of fish, with mushroom catsup ; bread 
and butter. Dessert — cherry pie with cheese. 

Possibly some hints as to economical dishes for dinner 
may be of service. Such hints, adapted to each day of the 
week, are added to render this needed service. 

DINNER FOR EVERY DAY. 
Sunday. — Roast beef, potatoes, and greens. Dessert — 
pudding or pie, cheese. 

Monday. — Hashed beef, potatoes, and bread-pudding. 

Tuesday. — Broiled beef, vegetables, apple-pudding. 

Wednesday. — Boiled pork, beans, potatoes, greens, and 
pie, or rice-pudding. 

Thursday. — Roast or broiled fowl, cabbage, potatoes, lemon 
pie, cheese. 

Friday. — Fish, potato croquettes, escalloped tomatoes, 
pudding. 

Saturday. — A la mode beef, potatoes, vegetables, suet-pud- 
ding and mince pie, cheese. 



THE BILL OF FARE. 347 

As one who attempts to master the many dishes at the 
table of a great hotel finds himself worsted, so the house- 
wife who attempts at once to master the foregoing sugges- 
tions will find herself Patient and repeated attention, how- 
ever, will master the whole. 

QUANTITY OF PROVISION NEEDED.. 

What quantity of the standard articles must be provided 
for entertainments ? This question is a practical one of no 
small importance. Nobody wishes to run short at a com- 
pany, nor does a prudent person care to waste good food. 
How then shall estimates be made which can be fairly 
depended on ? Experience shows the following general 
principles to hold good. 

It is safe to assume that of one hundred and fifty invited 
guests, but two-thirds of the number will be present. If 
five hundred are invited, not more than three hundred can 
be counted upon as accepting. Smaller numbers will be 
more largely represented in proportion. 

Allow one quart of oysters to every three persons present. 
Five chickens, or, what is better, a ten-pound turkey, boiled 
and minced, and fifteen heads of celery, are enough for 
chicken salad for fifty guests ; allow one gallon of ice-cream 
to every twenty guests ; one hundred and thirty sandwiches 
for one hundred guests ; and six to ten quarts of wine jelly 
for each hundred. 

For a company of twenty, allow three chickens for salad ; 
one hundred pickled oysters; two molds of Charlotte 
russg ; one gallon. of cream, and four dozen biscuits. 

CURIOUS DISHES AND BILLS OF FARE.

VARIETIES OF TABLE LINEN. — FANCY FOLDINJ? OF NAPKtNS. 

WHEN Solomon described the model woman of his 
day, among other praiseworthy things he said of 
her was this : " She maketh fine linen, and selleth 
it." Into what forms she put this fine linen is not stated, 
butwemaybe sure that 
some was table-linen. 
With the imperfect ap- 
pliances of that day 
she could not equal 
Brown's Irish linens, 
which are now the 
standards ; but, doubt- 
less, she kept her fine 
linen pure and white. 
Such linen is fitly asso- 
ciated with royalty in 
many references of an- 
tiquity, and with the 
purity of saints in refer- 
ences of the Scripture. 
There is no finer 
field for the display of 
a housewife's neatness 
than is found in table- 
linen. It adds so much 
to every meal, or de- 
tracts so seriously from 

it, that everybody appreciates skill in its management,

All our linen tablecloths and napkins are imported and 

are -made of genuine linen. 
Highly colored cloths are 
not linen. Flax will not 
take high coloring. The 
highly colored cloths and 
napkins are cotton, and are 
generally of domestic origin. 
True linens for table uses 
are pure white, white and 
brown, or white with border- 
ing of light colors. They 
are made plain, with simple 
figures, or in elaborate pat- 
terns. The largest pattern 
tablecloths regularly in the 
market are two and a half 
yards wide by eight yards 
long. Tablecloths cut from 
piece goods can be had of 
any length. 

Napkins of regular make 
are five-eighths, six-eighths, 
or seven-eighths of a yard 





square. They are made to match the standard tablecloths.

Doilies can be had from four inches square upward. The 
smallest sizes are used by dentists ; 
the next under finger-bowls ; the 
largest sizes are used with fruit, etc. 
They, too, can be had to niatch 
cloths and napkins of standard 
colors and styles. 

White table-linen is the article for 
dinners and formal meals. Colored 
linen, or cotton goods, are admis- 
sible at tea or luncheon. The 
whole equipment of linen at a given 
meal should be of one and the same 
kind and color. Good table-linen 
requires no starch. It will polish 
well by good ironing. It should al- 
ways be immaculately clean. Slop- 
ped, stained, fly-covered table-linen is 
disgusting. A floor-cloth should not be used in the sad- 
ly soiled condition in 
which many a table- 
cloth does duty. 

A large, well-lighted, 
and well-aired closet 
should be appropriated 
for table-linen. Unless 
the washing would 
thereby become crush- 
ingly heavy, the better 
way is to wash every 
napkin after one using. 
Dispense with the nap- 
kin-ring. It does guar- 
antee to a man his own 
soiled linen ; but it is far better to give him clean linen.

A plain square fold of the napkin can be made by a child, 

as may an ordinary fun- 
nel or cone-shaped twist, 
so that the napkin may 
be set into a goblet. But 
beyond these simple 
forms there are artistic 
heights of napkin-folding 
to which only profes- 
sionals attain. It is the 
boast of some skilled 
linen-men of the caterers 
that they can fold nap- 
kins in fifty, sixty, and 
even a hundred ways. 
Sure it is that Masonic 
dinners can be served 
with the square and com- 
pass in napkins ; mili- 
tary men gan have the 
tent ; physicians can 
have the mortar and 
pestle, and so on indefi- 
nitely. 

To accomplish fine 

work in this line a full-sized 
napkin must be used, and it 
must be well starched and 
ironed flat. Amateurs in 
the art should practice on 
paper of proper si^e. Practice 
will promote expertness, and to devise new forms will soon 
be easy and entertaining work. In our diagrams of napkin- 
folding the relative sizes of the several folds are not main- 
tained strictly, but the folds are shown correctly.

VI.— WORK AND HELP. 

tHE DOMESTIC struggle; "FLATS;" REGULARITY; FORETHOUGHT; 

supervision; accountability; kitchens; conveniences; 

KITCHEN company; GENERAL HINTS. 

THERE is no housekeeper who will not weary of the 
household work if she attempt to do it in person ; nor 
is there one whose patience will not be sorely tried if 
she attempt to do it by proxy. Physical exhaustion on the 
one side, and mental exhaustion on the other, are the Scylla 
and Charybdis between which the good housewife struggles 
to guide the domestic craft. Some make fairly good pro- 
gress in the effort, but more are sorely tried and buffeted, 
while many finally go down in the whirlpool of boarding- 
house or hotel life, or are shattered and scattered as families. 

The comparatively new method of " flats," as conducted 
in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, is a Parisian 
idea adapted to American necessities. In immense struc- 
tures, with eight or ten floors, apartments are fitted up usually 
in sumptuous style, with every convenience and luxury. 
Elevators carry the residents and callers to any floor, so that 
the ninth floor is virtually as good as the first. The hall- 
ways and apartments are heated and cared for by house 
servants ; the meals are served a la carte, in a general din- 
ing-hall or restaurant, or are served in the rooms if desired ; 
so that the only care the occupants have is the incidental 
charge of their own rooms and their social duties. This 
method avoids all personal labor and all care about servants, 
and yet each family has its own home. 

Of course there are no yards or gardens in such places. 
When there are little children in a family the opportunities 



H^OUX- AND HELP. 359 

are rather restricted. The old home idea is wholly- 
lost in such a dwelling-place. Domestic duties are in utter 
disuse. Home cooking has no foothold. Home decoration 
may be practiced to a limited extent, and home courtesy 
may prevail ; but after all, the home life barely exists. 

In the old-fashioned home life, regularity is a prime factor. 
Without it all will speedily run to disorder. To do things 
regularly requires forethought and planning. What to do 
and when to do it, must both be clearly understood. Then 
the predetermined plans must be rigidly adhered to and 
carried through. Servants see at a glance whether the head 
of the house " means business " or not. Any number of 
orders may be issued, but if the servants know that it means 
nothing, they do not concern or bestir themselves. Orders 
should be few as possible, but they should be well con- 
sidered and explicit, and when once issued they should be 
conformed to absolutely. 

Vaporing, scolding, fretting, and storming about the house 
only lower the lady of the establishment in the esteem of her 
employees. Her superiority must appear in her calm delib- 
eration and her intelligently formed decisions. But 
these need not be issued in an arbitrary, dictatorial form. 
The American spirit does not brook much of this. Help 
worth having can suit itself readily in other places, and such 
help will not submit to arbitrary or tyrannical treatment. 

One of the best advisers of young housekeepers says to 
them : " Never, except in cases of extreme emergency, 
allow Monday's washing to be put off till Tuesday, Tues- 
day's ironing till Wednesday, or Wednesday's finishing up 
and setting to rights till Thursday. Leave Thursday for 
extra work ; or when that is not required, for a resting day 
or a half holiday, and as a preparation for the up-stairs 
sweeping and dusting of Friday, and the down-stairs baking 
and scrubbing of Saturday." In this advice all good house- 
wives will concur, though the men of the house, to quote 



360 ^-^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

one such, " cannot see why so arbitrary and inflexible a rule 
should be imposed upon the domestic economy." 

Forethought will prove a great help in saving time, fuel, 
labor, and temper. For example : Mix bread at night, and 
it will be ready to bake with that " first fire," which always 
makes the oven hot in the morning. 

Prepare fi-uit over night, so that pies or other prepara- 
tions for dessert can be quickly made, and baked imme- 
diately after the bread. 

Prepare hash for breakfast over night. 
Have the kitchen and dining-room put in order before 
going to bed. 

Have kindlings and whatever is requried for building 
needed fires laid out ready, and the fire in the kitchen raked 
down, so that it can be started in the shortest possible time. 
This is not only a saving in the morning, but it will be 
found very useful in case of illness in the night when a fire 
may be required at a moment's notice. 

Much work is saved by forethought in purchases. If 
possible, lay in winter supplies ; buy starch, sugar, soap, tea, 
etc., etc., in quantities reasonably; large, and deliver them to 
the kitchen as needed ; it may be by the week, or twice a 
week. It should not be so often as to become irksome, not 
so seldom as to lose sight of what is going on. Dried 
soap will prove an immense saving by its hardness, as com- 
pared with the soft, fresh bars for which the servant runs 
twice or thrice a week. Money and labor both are saved 
by such forethought as this. 

Constant supervision is essential to securing good work. 
Eye-service is the bane of our laboring classes. See that 
orders are obeyed ; see that things are put to proper uses ; 
see that house-cloths do not become dish-cloths, or vice 
versa ; that hand-towels do not become cup-towels, • or vice 
versa; that combs, brushes, etc., etc., are kept out of the 
cooking apartment ; that the cellar broom is not used on 



If^O/iJir AND ITELP. 361 

the parlor carpet, or vice versa. Indeed, there is no end to 
the points that the housewife must supervise, if she be 
determined to have her work well done. 

Accountability for articles belonging to each department 
must be insisted on with every servant. No article must be 
allowed to disappear without a sufficient reason. Nor must 
anything be out of its proper place, except as necessary. 
Explain to each new servant the nature of this accountability 
and hold every one steadily to it. 

It is said that American kitchens are the worst in the 
world. Work is very materially promoted by means of a 
good kitchen. It should be roomy, light, and capable of 
good ventilation without sending its odors and its steam 
through the house. It should have plenty of good, con- 
venient closets for all that pertains to the work there done. 
It should have direct access to the fuel, store-rooms, or cel- 
lar where provisions are stored, and convenient access to the 
dining-room. A window communication is best between 
kitchen and dining-room, using a waiting-maid to receive. 

The conveniences of range, hot and cold water, sink, etc., 
are desirable, of course, but in some places they are not 
attainable. A dish-drainer is a great convenience. It 
may be made of a grooved bodrd, slightly inclined so as to 
drain the water back into the sink or dish-pan. Dishes 
laid upon this as washed, that they may drain a few minutes, 
will be found in much better condition for wiping, and so 
labor will be saved. An elevated strip must surround all 
but the lower edge of this drainer to prevent the dishes 
from slipping off. 

Kitchen company seriously interferes with work and 
service. The employees of a house are social beings. They 
have their associations and must continue to have them, but 
much visiting destroys effective management. It demoral- 
izes servants and delays work. Company should be re- 
stricted to certain convenient hours, The indiscriminate fur- 



362 ^^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

nishing of meals to their visitors by servants should not be 
permitted. Permission at that point should be asked of the 
lady of the house, and she, not the servant, should judge 
whether the case is exceptional and allowable. Interfer- 
ence in the presence of the " guests " would probably create 
a scene, but a good understanding at the outset would be 
as likely to preclude all trouble. Indeed, so few housewives 
know their own minds in domestic management, that the 
servants are little to blame if they too are ignorant of " the 
lady's '' mind. Be reasonable with servants ; yea, be gen- 
erous ; but be explicit and decided. 

After this extended discussion, it still remains true that 
the thoughful, self-poised, kindly, but decided housewife 
will be the only one who will get the needed work done, and 
will find all her " help " really helpful. It seems wise to 
conclude this chapter with a few carefully selected 

HINTS ON HOME WORK. 

Aprons. — Have a good assortment of full-sized aprons 
which can be washed. They should be long and wide. 

Brooms. — Four brooms should be in simultaneous use in a 

• 

house. The best for the parlor and best rooms ; the second 
best for the sitting-room and dining-room ; the third for 
the kitchen; the last for the cellar, yard, etc. When the best 
broom shows wear, replace it with a new one, and " retire " 
the worst, moving the others back one place. Hang up 
brooms by a loop, or better, by a broom holder. (See Chap- 
ter xxi. Part I.) 

Closets, etc. — Scrub them out thoroughly and frequently. 
Cover dish-shelves with clean white papers ; the edges may 
be scolloped, or " pinked," if desired. 

Dish-cloths. — Old towels, crash, napkins, table-cloths, etc., 
make splendid dish-cloths. 



WOR/C AND HELP. 365 

Dusters. — Feather dusters throw dust from one place to 
another. They are poor tools, except for the lightest kind 
of work. Cloths are preferable. These should be shaken 
out-of-doors frequently, or washed. Damp chamois skins 
are best for articles not liable to damage by dampness. 

Fuel. — When cooking is not going on, the fire should be 
slacked by closing the dampers, etc. Coal should never be 
piled high in the stoves. It chokes the draft, makes heat 
Inhere it does no good, burns out the stove tops, and wastes 
willfully. Ashes should be sifted and picked over. A large 
saving will be effected thus. 

Holders. — Iron-holders, and others for hot pots, kettles, 
etc., will save time, labor, and burns. If such conveniences 
do not exist, towels will be substituted by the " help." 

Iroiilng Tools. — Keep the cloths, etc., in good, orderly 
shape in a clean, dry place. The irons must be kept free 
from moisture. 

Paper and Stiing. — Lay all such together in a convenient 
place, nicely straightened out, ready for use at any time. If 
too much accumulates, sell it or burn it. 

Pie-board. — This, with the roller, should be put away 
clean every time, in a scrupulously clean place. 

Pots and Kettles. — Put away thoroughly cleaned and well 
dried. Scald out coffee and tea-pots frequently with soda- 
water. Keep each in its proper place. 

ReMgerators. — Scrub and air these frequently. The 
purest and best makes need such treatment. 

Water Coolers. — Scrub and air these. Sediment will col- 
lect which must be unwholesome and unsavory. 

WMsks. — Use a clean, fine whisk for upholstered furniture. 
Have others for the stairs, corners of rooms, etc. All these 
in addition to whisks used for clothing. 



VII.— VENTILATION. 

ventilation needed; how to get it; by windows; by a 
shaft; with the heat; tacts and figures. 

FRESH air is essential to healthful and happy human 
existence. It is so free and abundant that there should 
be no lack anywhere or at any time. Out-of-doors we 
get it without care or planning ; but to get it in-doors, and 
so to get it that nobody is harmed, that nobody catches 
cold or gets the rheumatism, that is the problem. 

Every living being gives off the deadly carbonic acid gas 
continually, and at the same time consumes the vitalizing 
oxygen. Lamps, fires, combustion of all sorts, does the 
same, some forms of these being more active than others in 
the emission of carbonic acid gas. For every apartment 
where people live and fires burn there must be ventilation. 
Fresh air must come in, and foul air must go out. 

In cold weather, this must be so done that a reasonable 
warmth in the room shall be maintained, and it must always 
be so done that chilling drafts shall not strike persons in 
such way as to check perspiration and produce sickness. 

Ventilation in large buildings is usually provided for by 
forcing fresh air through all its ramifications. The air is 
admitted in such ways as shall most effectually diffuse it 
through the building, avoiding a.11 blasts or sensible currents. 
If mechanical means are employed to force air, the problem 
is compai-atively simple. Drive in enough air and distribute 
it with judgment, and it is all done. 

But dwelling-houses do not admit of these elaborate 



VENTILA TlOf/. 



365 



arrangements except in rare cases. How can they be venti- 
lated ? The commonest way is to open the window. If a 
wind be stirring, or if the temperature within and without the 
room vary much, currents of air will at once set in, and an 
open window will do the desired work. But if the atmos- 
phere be still and sultry, the windows may be open, and yet 
no interchange of air take place. The top of the window 
allows egress to the heated air. The bottom allows ingress 
to the colder, external air. To ventilate a room, both open- 
ings of the window are needed. If windows are only on 
one side of a room, a door upon the other side must be 
open to do the work properly. Currents which would be 
too strong, may be well broken by the ordinary shutter 
blinds, the angle given the slats determining the direction 
of currents to a great extent, and so breaking their volume 
as to render them practically harmless. 

An easy adaptation of ordinary windows for a good ven- 
tilating purpose is secured by inserting 
on the sill, where the bottom sash shuts 
down, a piece of wood the thickness of the 
sash, and long as the sash is wide, but 
about three inches high ; the effect being 
that the sash, shutting down on this strip, 
shall stand three inches above the sill and 
yet the bottom will be closed tight. The 
displacement between the upper and lower 
sash will leave an opening by which cur- I!. 
rents of air will pass in and out, ventilating \'T^ 
the room very fairly, and that, too, with- ^ cheap method 
out any perceptible draft. of ventilation. 

Another simple method is to tack muslin or ornamental 
cloth across the bottom of the window frame, inside the 
room, but not against the sash. The window may then be 
raised. The muslin should rise three times the height of 
the opening of the window. The effect of this is to produce 




-ggg THE HOVSEH'iFICS I.TBRARY. 

an interc.iarige of air, with positively no perceptible draft, 
even when the wind without is high. 

From the summit of the hallway, or open stairway of a 
house, it is well to carry an open pipe high above the roof, 
capped so as to keep out storm, and capable of being closed 
in the coldest weather. It will draw off the heated air of 
the house and render good service. 

A ventilating shaft is a great accessory to a house. It 
should be like a large flue, say two feet square, and by in- 
serting glass at the top it may be used for light also. Into 
such a shaft openings from the several rooms may be made, 
also from water-closets and reservoirs. This shaft _ should 
be placed next to a chimney flue which is always in use, so 
that the shaft itself will be warm enough to produce move- 
ment in the air. Or a surer way is to have at its base a 
heating apparatus of gas, oil, or steam, by means of which 
the current of air may be moved in the shaft and the entire 
house be ventilated. The outlet of such a shaft must be so 
constructed that snow and rain will not drive in even when 
the windows in it are open. It should be capable of entire 
closing also by means of cords and pulleys. 

Every fire drawing its oxygen from a room, carries air 
out of the room, and this consumed air must be replaced 
through cracks or crevices, if by no better means. Some 
ventilation is always gained where such fires burn, therefore. 
But when they burn low, it is a chance that they will emit 
more injurious gases than the fresh air drawn in can coun- 
terbalance. 

All heating methods which throw warmed air into the 
room may become valuable methods of ventilation. If the 
air be drawn direct from a foul cellar they A^ill be injurious. 
If the air be baked by contact with red-hot surfaces, it will 
be dry and to a great extent stripped of its oxygen. But 
take the air from without, if possible from the top of the 
house, by means of a cold-air flue ; heat this air by contact 



VENTILATW^r. 3(57 

with steam pipes or hot pipes, but not those which are red- 
hot, and you will have warm air and good air at one and 
the same time. Apertures or registers near the floor are 
needed in this case, by means of which cold air passes away. 
Near the floor the foul, heavy air settles also, which is driven 
out by the same means. Registers opening into a ventilat- 
ing shaft, as just described, form the best escape for impure 
air, as they carry it entirely out of the house. 

Some authorities recommend that ventilating openings be 
made directly into smoke-flues. Even if smoke and soot 
can be kept from entering the room where such a device is 
employed, which is doubtful, notwithstanding " traps " and 
other warranted contrivances, still every opening of this 
kind subtracts from the drafl: power of the fire below the 
opening, and hence is a disadvantage. The independent 
ventilation shaft: is the most valuable help. 

To enforce the need of ventilation, it may be stated that a 
pound of coal burned requires for its combustion one hun- 
dred and forty-eight cubic feet of air. Every gas-burner 
consumes about thirty-six cubic feet per hour. A candle 
consumes about eleven cubic feet per hour. A healthy 
adult requires two hundred and fifteen cubic feet of air per 
hour. Cofnbining these facts, the absolute necessity of a 
large supply of fresh air to every living-room is an easy 
demonstration. 



VIII.— WARMING. 

bonfires; fireplaces; franklin stoves; grates; low-down 
grates; modern stoves; heaters; gas stoves. 

IN the last chapter some points on the warming of houses 
have been touched. Ventilation and warming are sub- 
jects so closely related that they cannot be considered 
fully when apart. As in cooking, so in warming, the sinv 
plest method is the open fire, the mere bonfire in short. But 
from such a fire, it is an easy step to an inclosing structure 
which cuts off radiation of heat in useless directions and 
conducts smoke where it will do the least harm. Qn this 
principle the old-fashioned fireplaces were constructed. 
They did very little work in proportion to the fuel consumed, 
but where fuel was abundant that mattered little. Then, too, 
in such fires, at least one-half of the heat goes up the 
chimney, and some good authorities say that fifteen-six- 
teenths is thus lost. Such fires heat by direct radiation. 
Heat is thrown from them directly on the persons in the 
room, on the walls and other objects. These become heated, 
and in turn reflect heat so that all the contents of the room, 
atmosphere, and solid bodies are thoroughly warmed at last. 
Until this completeness of heating is attained, however, one 
may be blistering his face while cold creeps run down his 
back. Then, too, such heat quickly falls off. It is irregular, 
expensive, unsatisfactory. 

Benjamin Franklin made an improvement on the old warm- 
ing methods in the stoves which bear his name. He saved 
much of the heat which formerly escaped by making his 
«tove to sit in the room, and the smoke to reach the chimney 
by a circuitous passage, as in a stove-pipe. This compelled 

S68 



WARMIXG. 



36& 



much escaping heat to give off its power in the room. The 
fireplace of this stove was inclosed with another casing of 
iron, through which air circulated and passed into the room 
in a heated condition. So he had all the direct radiation of 
the fire and of the heated parts of the stove, plus the air 
which was heated by passing through the hot chambers. 

Grates are simply an adaptation of the old fireplace to the 
later discovery of coal as a fuel. They are less open and 
therefore less wasteful, but all the side and back power of 
the fire is lost to the room so far as heating it is concerned. 
It passes off by conduction, and is lost in the walls. 

Low-down grates are a favorite feature for fall and spring 
uses in sitting-rooms, offices, etc. They heat by direct 
radiation only, but for the lighter purposes in warming they 
are desirable as being both beautiful and suiificiently useful. 

A fine specimen of these grates is shown in the accom- 
panying cut. It is made with handsome nickel-plated frame 
and trimmings. In its 
" throat " is a double valve 
arrangement, shown in the 
cut, which can be used as 
a blower in starting the 
fire, as a damper in reduc- 
ing the draft, or as a reflec- 
tor to throw the heat into 
the room. These grates 
have indeed become so 
popular that improvement 
upon improvement has < 
been made, and decoration 
has been added to decoration, until they seem absolutely 
perfect, and certainly they are very beautiful. 

Closed stoves heat the air by its contact with their heated 
surfaces. They are now made with mica doors or windows, 
through which the direct radiation also passes, and air

chambers are added in which air is heated, so that stoves of 

an immense warming 
power, and withal 
very easy to manage, 
are now the standards. 
A specimen of such 
heating stoves is 
shown in the adjoin- 
ing engraving. Ex- 
ternally it is not at 
all displeasing to the 
eye. On the following

of this same stove is

times called ; the dam-

in the upper part of 
the stove front; the 
cylinder and anti- 
clinker grate, which 
is a notable feature. 
By opening the doors 
which surround this

debris can be removed

placed by direct radiation and heated air ; and to the rodm

modern stoves, are finished in 
very ornate styles. 

Hot-air furnaces have come 

.-p- ->^ into very general use. They 

* ... SiT^ combine so many advantages, 

^S^^^^Bfcfc^ and are withal so effective, 

that they well deserve the 
favor they have met. To 
elucidate the subject fully, a 
)^ IsJ ilavl' sectional view of a portable 

f ^ J^ iir jHHI heater is given. This differs 

•I ^^^ ^B Jdk J from the permanent or brick- 
inclosed heater chiefly in the 
method of inclosure, and in 
the capacity of the heating- 
drums. 

The time .was when but lit- 
tle attention was given to the 
construction of heaters. Al- 
most anything with an iron 
cylinder and a casing around 
it, that would consume coal, 
was considered a sufficient heater. No matter how much 
dust and dirt were made in the cellar or basement, and con- 
veyed through the flues to the parlor or rooms above, it 
was nevertheless supposed to answer for heating purposes. 
But those days have passed away; careful and scientific study 
has been applied to the subject. 

One valuable point in the heater shown in the cut is that 
whereby all ashes and clinker can be removed from the fire-i 
pot without dropping the fire. This can be done with less 
trouble than it takes to rake the old kind of heaters, and a^ 
continuous fire be kept always fresh on the grate. By this

WARMING. 373 

means the entire surface of the heater can be relied on for 
heat. In the old heaters, when the grate surface became 
covered with clinkers, and the cylinder half filled with ashes, 
only the upper surface afforded heat, which very often 
resulted in overheating the top and ruining the furnace. 

This heater is supplied with a magazine, making it a self- 
feeder. Another new feature is a radiating drumi and, in 
place of taking the damp, impure air from the cellar floor, 
with the dust and ashes, there is a cold air collar at the 
back of the heater so that a pipe can be attached, and pure, 
fresh air be brought from the outside of the building. 

At the base of the heater, on each side of the cylinder, 
are placed the water tanks, easy of access, where a sufficient 
quantity of water can be evaporated without boiling it. It 
also has a damper at the smoke-pipe. 

To all hot-air furnaces there are serious objections. They 
exhaust the moisture so completely that furniture is dried 
out and falls apart, and, worse than this, the moisture of the 
human system is so reduced that parched lips and difficulty 
of breathing often result. Furnace-heated air is drier than 
that ever heated in the midst of the Desert of Sahara. 
Evaporators may be introduced into the heaters and mois- 
ture may be restored again to the air, but a new danger 
arises. The sediment left by the constant evaporation of 
the water becomes unhealthy. This is demonstrated when, 
by reason of lowness of water in the evaporator, the sedi- 
ment begins to stew or to bake, in which case the house soon 
becomes rank with its offensive odors. The water-pan of 
the heater must be kept clean. Stewing or simmering 
animal or vegetable matter cannot be healthy. 

The principles to be regarded in determining the size of 
a heater are these : The greater the heating surface in a 
heater, the greater is the volume of air it can heat to a given 
temperature in a given time. A low fire will therefore im- 
paut wannth to a room fully equal to that from a hot fire ia

a smaller furnace. The one does a large volume of work 
deliberately. The other does it with a rush; but in the 
rush the air is baked, its moisture is exhausted, it is made 
unfit for use. The coal required is more in bulk in the 
larger furnaces, but it is not used half so fast. Large fire- 
pans are better, therefore, and cheaper — of course within 
reasonable bounds. Then, too, the moisture produced at a 
low temperature is preferable to that from excessive heat. 
The former is a gentle vapor, the later a driving steam. 

Hot water and steam are used in various applications for 
heating purposes, but not very generally in private houses, 
except as they heat air carried through coils containing 
steam or hot water. 

Among the contrivances applicable to furnaces and 
h«aters of all kinds are governors or regulators, which can 
be set so that when the heat reaches a certain height the 
drafts will close automatically! When the heat falls they 
will open. Thus an equal temperature is maintained even 
in the absence of immediate supervision. 



GAS HEATING-STOVES. 

After seeing the wonderful adaptations of gas to cooking 
purposes, no one will wonder that there are many happy 
adaptations of the same to heating purposes. The Goodwin 
Gas Stove Company, from whose constructions the illustra- 
tions already given were selected, furnishes heating-stoves 
also. 

The principles upon which these stoves are constructed 
are thoroughly scientific, and at the same time so simple 
that they require little or no attention. The ventilating 
principle is so applied that no injurious products of com- 
bustion can escape into the room in which they are placed, 
but all are carried oif to the flue or out-of-doors by the pipe 
seen in the opposite cuts. The stoves have an air passage

from the floor, and in its passage comes in contact with the 
sides of the centre tubes and becomes highly heated. The

doors' by means of a tube when so desired. Their consump- 
tion of gas is but seven cubic feet per hour. One of them 
will heat a room containing from eight hundred to one 
thousand cubic feet of space. They are six inches in 
diameter and twenty-three inches high. 

If the open fire appearance is desired, the stove called 
the " Cheerful " meets the case. 

These stoves are especially designed for use in parlors, 
libraries, and sitting-rooms. The panels in the front and 
sides are fitted with porcelain or metal tiles. The frames 
are nickel-plated, or enameled in black or brown with 
bronzed chambers. The tops are of marble, and can be 
varied in color to suit the taste.

They are constructed upon principles so correct scientifi- 
cally, and at the same time so simple, that they require little

supply of fresh air from out-of-doors, and they carry off the

inches high, sixteen inches wide, twelve inches deep. 

Smaller stoves are in cast-iron only, but these have a 
boiling burner at the top. The smallest of this line is eleven 
inches high, ten and a half inches wide, and nine inches 
deep. It will warm a small room or take the chill from a 
large one. 



IX.— ILLUMINATION. 

CANDLES, lamps, and gas are so familiar that in theit 
ordinary uses they need not be so much as mentioned. 
But all these articles have undergone so much of im- 
provement that a few points concerning them may be of 
value.

Finely wrought brass 
candlesticks,' for use or 
for ornament, are quite 
popular also, though it 
seems like a return to the 
days of our fathers. 

The student-lamp (for 
kerosene oil) has come 
into very extensive use.

In specialties of this character, the Manhattan Brass Com-

York, has done 
many good things. 
The above brack-

theirs, as are the

Parlor lamps in other patterns of surpassing beauty are 
numerous, two of them with richly ornamented globes being 
shown on the following page. All these lamps are made in 
fine cast or wrought brass and form exquisite decorations. 

When gas is in- 
troduced into a 
house, the possi- 
bilities afforded in 
the fixtures are 
very fine, as will be 
illustrated farther 
on under the head 
of " Home Decora- 
tion." The facili- 
ties for the home 
manufacture of gas 
are many and very 
satisfactory. 

Gas machines 
are designed espe- 
cially for the illu- 
mination of build- 
ings beyond the 
reach of public gas 
works. They can 
be adapted for large 
factories and hotels 
as also for private 
houses. In the 
Springfield Gas Machine gas is produced by bringing a cur- 
rent of air in contact with gasoline, the vapors of which 
combine with the air and produce a clear, white, agreeable 
gas, which is distributed as common gas by similar fixtures. 
The apparatus, as will be seen by the engravings which 
follow, consists of two instruments — an air-pump, operated

by a weight being used to produce the air-current, and a

the process of gas- 
making is as follows : 
The action of the 
pump draws a supply 
of air through the in-

without the building 
and forces it through 
the air-pipe leading^ 
to the gas-generator.^^ 
In its passage through 
the generator it be-

thus forming an illu- 
minating gas that is 
returned by the gas-

burners within the 
building.

months, varying according to the rapidity of the consump- 
tion of gas. Gauges upon the generator show at any time 
the amount of fluid it contains and when necessary to re- 
plenish it. A doubk-way cock connecting with both the 
filling and vent-pipes in the vault is used, so that of neces- 
sity a free vent is given while filling, thus preventing any 
backward pressure of gas upon the pump or strain upon 
the generator. The weight of the pump does not require 
winding, commonly, oftener than once or twice a week, and 
this takes but a moment's time. 

The pressure of gas in the ordinary gas works is so 
strong that there is an immense waste at the burners and 
at every possible crevice for escape. It is wise to turn, the 
gas wholly off during the day, using for this purpose a 
connection between the meter and the street, so preventing 
all waste. Even at night the full pressure should not or- 
dinarily be allowed. When the burners are lighted as may 
be desired for the evening, turn down the valve at the me- 
ter until the gas flame just shows the effect. This may 
cut off nearly half the flow of gas, and yet the light remain 
ample. A great reduction of gas-bills will be secured in this 
way. You will get the benefit of all vou pay for, as no 
gas will escape unconsumed. 

When light is desired all night in a bedroom, by all 
means use tapers. A box of these, costing ten cents, 
can be bought at the apothecaries, and will last many 
weeks. Each box contains a tiny socket, or circle, of tin 
with three sharp points holding a bit of cork. Into this 
socket sets a button-mold a quarter of an inch in diame- 
ter, with a hole in the middle, in which is inserted a bit of 
waxed wicking. The whole affair, not larger in circvmfer- 
ence than a walnut, floats on the surface of a cup or tum- 
bler full of lard-oil, and gives a very soft and pleasant lights 
and is perfectly safe and wholesome.

IKSIDIOUS CAUSES OF ILLNESS; SEWER GASES; "TRAPS," VEN-

AGE ; SYPHONING TRAPS ; GERMICIDE ; WEATHER STRIPS ; ETC. 

THERE is much sickness in these days which passes as 
Bilious, Typhoid, or Malarial Fevers. The inciting 
causes of disease are not easily determined. There are 
physical conditions which predispose to disease. Often 
these are wholly independent of the immediate cause under 
which the patient succumbs. In other cases, the final crash 
is only an advanced stage of the derangement which has 
gone forward steadily under continuous inciting causes. 
This is the case in that class of diseases to which reference 
has been made. 

When a good housewife sees any of her charge losing 
appetite, vigor, color, and ambition, it is certain that some 
evil influence is at work, for which thorough search should 
at once be made. It may be that poisonous gases are- creep- 
ing up the waste-pipe of the permanent wash-basin. It may 
be that the bath-room is belching forth death. It may be 
that the cistern whence the drinking-water comes is receiv- 
ing pollution from surface drainage or from some hidden 
flow of vileness. It may be that noxious gases are exuding 
from the ground itself, " made ground," perhaps, into which 
filth of all sorts has been dumped. It may be that a drain- 
pipe is broken or leaking, and that the soil about the house 
is becoming saturated with waste waters, which ferment and 
putrefy, and send up deadly vapors, even from beds of 
flowers. These are a few of the insidious ways in which ' 
aewer gas and other poisonous influences do their work. 

383 



384 TfiE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARV. 

When water is introduced into a house its drainage must 
be perfect. Every opening from the pipes must be so 
" trapped " that gases cannot work back into the house. 
Scientific plumbing alone can secure this point. The best 
made trap may be so set that the water will syphon out of 
it, and leave no " water-seal " to stop the ingress of sewer 
gases. If this be properly arranged gas will not force back 
through the water except under pressure, as when a heavy 
rain storm fills the sewers. To meet this liability, every 
trap should have a ventilating pipe from its arch, or the side 
away from the opening into the house. This pipe must be 
carried to the roof, and there left open. All the gases will 
thus find vent. A still better plan is to carry the soil-pipe 
directly to the roof, capping it to exclude storm, but not to re- 
strict the outflow of gas. Scrupulous cleanliness and frequent 
disinfecting of the pipes by copperas, dissolved in hot water, 
are essential. In a few hours the water of the seal will ab- 
sorb gases so as to become in itself a source of impurity. 
What is known as " seat ventilation " is the best remedy for 
this, or frequent flushing. 

Filters will separate material impurities from drinking- 
water, but the deadliest ingredients are not removable in 
this Way. The only remedy for a well that receives impurity 
from the depths is to fill it up. If impure from surface 
drainage, cement and better grading may save it. Chemical 
analysis alone can detect the subtle poisons which often lurk 
in water. Some most sparkling and beautiful waters are 
rank poison. If suspicious of water and unable to provide 
a sure remedy, use rain water. It lacks the life of good 
spring water, but it also lacks the death that always lurks 
in city wells and generally in those of villages and rural 
settlements. 

Cellars are nearer akin to graves than many suspect. Good, 
hard, impenetrable cement floors and walls are essential in 
most localities. Noxious influences lurking in the soil and 



SAmi'ARV CONDITIONS. 535 

oozing thence can be hermetically sealed down by no other 
means. An abundance of whitewash is good for a cellar. 
Frequent sweeping and airing, with the careful removal of 
decaying vegetables or fruits, must be added. 

If suspicious of drainage, dig and see. A leaky pipe, 
even when several feet under ground, has cost many a life. 
Allow no marshy places, no pools of stagnant water, no 
compost heaps, or other foul spots upon your home prem- 
ises. Do not allow the earth about the kitchen door to be 
saturated with slops thrown out. Make other disposition of 
such refuse. Cleanliness is akin to godliness and also to 
healthfulness. 

In a drain for a private house a four-inch pipe is suffi- 
cient. It is better than one twice the size, as the flow is 
more concentrated and powerful. Straight lines and even 
descents are always desirable. Every deviation presents an 
obstacle and invites stoppage. The jointing must be very 
perfect, or it will check solid material, causing stoppage and 
leakage, with their long train of expense and sickness. To 
prevent the slow flow of water, which is apt to result in 
stoppage in drain pipes, flushing tanks have been invented. 
These operate on a syphon principle, emptying the tank at 
intervals with a rush of water which sweeps all debris be- 
fore it. 

The latest conclusions in scientific drainage require an 
air-pipe to connect with every trap of the drainage system, 
on the sewer side of the curve, so that when water goes 
down the soil-pipe with a rush, it will not syphon the water 
out of the traps. It usually does this because the rush of 
water creates a momentary vacuum into which the water of 
the traps is forced by the atmospheric pressure behind it. 
This air-pipe, when introduced, supplies air to the vacuum, 
and so prevents syphoning and its consequent ill effect of a 
trap without water, which leaves an oppn passage for sewer 
gases.

But, after all, it remains true that all the modern systems 
of interior drainage are liable to imperfection. There will 
be some putrefaction, and, consequently, some development 
of those insidious germs of disease now known so surely to 
lie at the foundation of all contagion and infection. To hit 
the death-blow to these, or indeed to prevent their ever 
coming to vitality, an apparatus known as the " Germicide " 
(germ-killer), has been invented, and is strongly indorsed.

as indicated. The chain H, attached to the closet-hd, passes 
over the pulley I, actuates the plunger K, causing it to enter 
the thymol compartment L whenever the closet-lid is opened 
and to be withdrawn whenever the lid is closed. The plun- 
ger, being clothed with an absorbent,- becomes saturated 
with thymol solution when lowered, and when raised liberates 
thymol vapor through the circular aperture G. 

The Germicide requires no attention whatever from the 
inmates of the house, as it is always under the supervision 
of the Company's uniformed, experienced inspectors. The 
appliance remains always the property of the Company, and 
is placed for service at such an annual rental for inspection 
and supply of chemicals as to bring it within the means of 
the most humble householder. It is neatly encased in black 
walnut and is attached without interference with the plumb- 
ing of a house. Germicide Companies are located in New 
York, Cincinnati, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, etc. 

On the need of a disinfecting agent in every drainage sys- 
tem of a house. Professor Joseph C. Richardson, of the 
University of Pennsylvania, thus speaks : 

" The true method of obviating this danger is by steriliz- 
ing with slow currents or drippings of solutions of sulphate 
of iron, corrosive sublimate, arsenic, carbolic acid, etc., the 
whole interior of our waste-pipes, just as the shores of the 
Dead Sea and the banks of certain small streams are steril- 
ized by mineral ingredients or poisonous metallic substances 
from manufacturing refuse, with which their waters are 
mirfgled. ... I am confident that the key to this momen- 
tous problem of how to avoid infection from • sewer gas,' or, 
more correctly, sewer air, entering our dwellings, is to be 
found in the principle of so sterilizing the whole interior of 
all pipes communicating with sewers, and, if possible, of the 
sewers themselves (by frequently irrigating them with fluids 
containing metallic compounds poisonous to plant life), that 
no vegetable organisms can propagate within them."

Nothing worth having is to be had without expense either of time or

those that cost least.

IT is true that " Home is where the heart is." But some 
hearts are low in their tendencies, and are satisfied to 
tarry where others find no rest. There are hearts of 
refined quahty and lofty aspiration. These dwell among 
life's better and nobler things. The best is none too good 
for them. They " covet earnestly the best gifts," and as 
opportunity allows they add one and another of these best 
things to their personal possessions. 

Some have a passion for clothes ; some for jewelry ; some 
for books ; but the true housewife desires that her home, 
" be it ever so humble," shall at least be clean, neat, and 
tasteful. She asks how others live ; how the homes of 
those more favored of fortune are furnished ; how her own 
little abode may be made more home-like, more lovely, 
more cozy. Such questions deserve answer. 

Decoration has more to do with many homes than the 
furnishing has. It puts the finishing touches on the furnish- 
ing. It embellishes the home. But furnishing can lay a 
good foundation for decoration. It can prepare the way 
splendidly. 

Forms of beauty may be introduced into every part of a 
house. Standard furniture is everywhere made with this idea 
in view. Every furniture store of any advancement shows 
it. The time was when the " Cottage " sets led the market.

These were sold at low prices, and they were in many cases 
really beautiful. The coloring and decoration, as well, as 
the lines of the work, were artistic. They formed a good 
basis for decoration.

Passing into the house from the hall or entry-way, the

in the average American home, this is the most costly and 
the least useful of all rooms. The cabinetmaker usually rules 
here and sways his sceptre with unquestioned supremacy.

styles employed in upholstering furniture. It should har« 
monize and beautify both the wood used and the carpets 
laid. Cherry and mahogany furniture is not best set off by 
crimson reps or damasks, nor are ebony and black walnut 
best shown by dark coverings. Light and bright colored 
woods show best with dark and rich colored goods, while 

the darkest woods best display 
the brightest colorings and 
textures. 

If the walls are papered, it 
must be with due regard to 
the other appointments of the 
room. Such combinations as 
will make all the contents of 
the room help each other 
should be sought out. Where 
many paintings adorn the 
walls, the papering must be 
rich but subdued in colors. 
The finest work of art may be 
killed by the flashy back- 
ground on which it is hung. 
Where there are but few pic- 
tures, or where engravings 
alone appear, the paper may 
take on rich forms and colors, 
but it should never run to 
excess. Loud, glaring, flashy 
styles may be suitable for 
public places, but they are 
not for cozy homes. To secure 
what is right, consult your best paper-hanger ; try samples ; 
do not decide at once or off-hand ; weigh the subject ; sleep 
over it ; thus you will probably reach a decision that will be 
a permanent satisfaction.

Now that this company-room, or best living-room as it

tee can be transformed into a thing of beauty and a minister 
of comfort. 

One of the prettiest tables for a parlor, library, or sitting- 
room, and one that is highly artistic as well as of historic 
interest, has been designated the "Shakespeare Table," being

fashioned after one still shown in the former home of the fa- 
mous old bard. The cut shows the square Shakespeare table, 
but it is made oblong also in two sizes, and in mahogany, 
ebony, walnut, and ash. For the ornamental covers now so 
generally used on tables, this style is specially adapted. It 
is entirely free from the top-heavy appearance and unstable 
condition of many ornamental tables in general use. 




COOPER'S SHAKESPEARE TABLE. 

To accompany a piano and to retain music and music- 
books in good order a very handsome piece of furniture, 
" The Canterbury," shown in a previous cut, is just suited. 
It can be had in a variety of styles and in woods finished to 
match the ordinary standard pianos. Another contrivance 
for similar purposes and very beautiful in construction is 
shown on the page following the " Canterbury." It is made

in different woods and is known as the " Music Portfolio." 
What a beautifully ornamental piece of furniture it is a 
glance at the engraving will show. 

We have also shown a highly ornamental carved pedestal, 
on the upper stage of which a piece of statuary may be 
placed, the tops being varied in size to suit different pieces. 
On the lower stages other ornaments may be placed, with 
books, flowers, or bric-a-brac, as necessity may require or 
as taste may suggest. 

Similar in purpose, but of far hghter construction, is the 
Jardiniere stand. For floral displays, card receivers, statu- 
ettes, and such articles, it is most beautifully adapted. Its 
structure is so light and 
graceful that it pleases the 
eye and gratifies the taste 
of every observer. 

Other forms of beauty ap-

stands and tables. One con- 
structed in dark wood and

It meets all the require- 
ments for small stands of this book-racks. 
character. The use of brass ornaments is coming more and 
more into vogue also, so that this construction is fully up 
to the times. 

When books are displayed in a parlor or sitting-room, 
the large ones may lie upon the table, but the smaller ones 
should be placed in book-racks which hold them in position 
neatly with their backs upward. Two of these racks are 
shown in cuts given above. The ornamental ends of the 
racks turn upward upon hinges and are capable of longitu- 
dinal extension, so that few books or many, as may be 
required, can be held in proper position by this means. 
They are entirely in style.

ORNAMgNTAL EASBL. 

A fine corner-fur- 
nishing for a parlor is 
secured in an ornamen- 
tal easel, one of which 
in very beautiful form 
is shown in the accom- 
panying cut. Of course, 
the ea^el implies a 
picture or handsome 
engraving to rest upon 
it. Because of this 
use, an easel should be 
of dark wood, orna- 
mented only in the 
matter of carving, so 
that it shall not present 
any dominating or de- 
tracting colors in com- 
parison with a picture 
which may rest upon it. 

Easels are some- 
times finished with a 
portfolio or pocket at 
the lower part in which 
engravings may be 
kept. When it is de- 
sired to show these, 
they are placed upon 
the shelf above the 
pocket, and afterward 
returned to the pocket 
for safe keeping. This 
receptacle presents 

J an ornamental front.

A library or reading-room should be studiously fitted for 
its purpose. All glaring colors should be avoided as inju- 
rious to the eye and tending to divert from work. Green 
and oak are favorite colors for the library, though dark 
brown and walnut answer well. Arrangements for Hght by 
day or by night must be scrupulously regarded. It should

may be kept from the upper ends of the books by a strip of 
fancy colored leather attached to the edge of the shelf, and 
hanging a little below it, so as to reach the tops of the 
books. If this be "pinked," as is not unfrequent, it is 
apt to curl up and fail of its purpose. It is better to use a 
Strip with a plain edge, ornamenting it with gold stamping.

and over which pictures, brackets, wall-pockets, and orna-

mental articles may be placed. The lowest shelves of 
the cases are best wrought into a row of drawers, as dust 
from the floor soils books which are so near it. Whether 
a table or a desk be preferable depends on the leading pur- 
pose for which the room is used. A cylinder desk which 
may be entirely closed is best where private papers are 
liable to be dis- 
turbed. For most 
home uses, how- 
ever, this is not 
needful. 

Carpeting, pa- 
per-hanging, "cur- 
tains, and other 
accessories of the 
room should be 
in keeping with 
its general pur- 
pose and plan. If 
there is a low- 
down grate or fire- 
place, it should be 
done in tiles. The 
mantle should be 
of carved wood 
to match the fur- 
niture, surmount- 
ed with light shelving at either end for books and orna- 
ments. A mirror may be placed over the centre. Restful 
chairs, a comfortable lounge, a student's lamp, and such 
appliances find appropriate places in this room. 

The library may be combined with the ladies' sitting-room, 
unless it is needed as a real study. If devoted to the double 
use, a ladies' workstand, such as has already been shown, 
is quite in place. This is suitable in any room where it will

serve as a convenience. Hanging cabinets-or brackets, which 
are abundantly illustrated in previous pages, are admissible 
in the library. Their contents are illustrative of beauty and 
art. They are object lessons on topics which many books 
in the library are fairly presumed to discuss. The scrap- 
basket on some of the beautiful patterns illustrated under 
home decoration is appropriate in the library. Wall pockets 

and pocket easels are numer- 
ous and beautiful, and they, 
too, naturally belong here. 
As receptacles of newspapers, 
letters, etc., they are just in 
place. But they must not be 
allowed to degenerate into 
rubbish holders. They may 
gather papers for a week, or 
some such short period, but 
they must be overhauled fre- 
quently, or they will offend 
good taste, which is always 
allied to neatness. 

A rich wall bracket, or a 
comer bracket, is admissable 
in any room, and may be used 
for many purposes. Our illus- 
trations of these embody the 
stag's head. Uniformity in the pattern of brackets for a 
given room may be followed, or, with equal propriety, it 
may be disregarded. Nor is it important in the incidental 
decorations of a room that the prevailing wood of the furni- 
ture be followed. Variety may be admitted with all readiness, 
provided that it is not carried to the extent of evident 
and glaring incongruity. 

Concerning the dining-room, a fine writer on domestic 
affairs speaks thus : " Probably there is no better test of

the refinement of a family than the relation of its dining- 
room to the rest of the house. If the family meal is re- 
garded as a mere feeding, the place where it is taken will 
plainly show the fact. If the meal be a cheerful house- 
1 hold ceremony, where the best quali- 
ties of head and heart engage, and to 
which the most honored friends are' 
gathered, these facts, too, will be in- 
dicated by the room." 

The central object of the dining- 
room is the table. It should be on 
the extension principle, and between 
meals it should be covered with a 
rich colored cloth. To set the table for 
the next meal as one is cleared away 
may save labor, but it savors of un- 
tidiness, for the dust must gather upon cloth and dishes in 
the interval. True, the laid table may be covered to pro- 
tect it. Dining-room , 
chairs should be cov- 
ered with leather. A 
lounge or a rocking- 
chair is out of place 
in this room. It is

differing tastes. More coloring is admitted to the dining- 
room papers than elsewhere, because high colors in their 
decorations are not deemed best. Engravings, carvings, 
statuary, and paintings in some cases, are admitted to elegant 
dining-apartments. Some disapprove of the introduction of 
subjects connected with food, such as game, poultry, fruit, 
etc., in dining-room decorations, but good usage holds to 
this line, nevertheless, and with eminent fitness. 




ORNAMENTAL POCKET EASEL. 



In the' superb dining-hall of the Lick House, of San 
Francisco, art has done its best. Columns, carvings, stained 
glass, and painting combine to make it simply magnificent. 
Immense pictures of Pacific coast scenery fill the panels 
around the room between its clustering columns. It is 
undoubtedly a superb hall, but no guest can appreciate the 
display as he sits at his own seat, and no refined guest 
wishes to be craning his neck this way and that, to see all 
these gems of the painter's art. Nor does a lover of art 
wish to parade around the room and study the pictures

409 



while others are at their meals ; nor does he wish so to do 
while the servants are preparing the room and the tables 
for the meals. The fact is, that in this sumptuous rOom art 
has gone astray. A dining-room is not a picture gallery. 

The conspicuous piece of furniture in a dining-room is 
the sideboard or buffet. Its possibilities are well-nigh 
illimitable. Ancestral plate, if there be any, may repose 
here in its venerable dignity. If you have none such, bright 
china, glassware, lacquer work, and natural fruit or flowers 
will do full well. It is worth while to study effect in this 
article of furniture, for it is the one article at which your 
guests will look. A wooden 
top to your buffet is safer for 
the glassware than one of 
marble. Valuable glass and 
china will inevitably be chipped 
and marred if set frequently 
upon marble. 

When a meal is in progress 
good taste allows the finger 
bowls to stand ready for use 
on the buffet. Each should 
be on a plate with a small 
doiley under it. Harlequin 
sets of finger bowls, no two being of the same color, but all 
bright and beautiful, are now in style, and they ornament 
the buffet very richly. High glass dishes cut into diamond 
points are also highly ornamental, especially if the buffet be 
well lighted, which it should be. Natural flowers are a wel- 
come adornment on the buffet as well as upon the table, but 
they should be very choice and of delicate odor. 

The gas-fixtures or lamps of a dining-room go far to 
beautify it. An unending variet}' is at command, with all 
shapes and colors of shades or globes, and untold variety in 
the fixtures themselves. Be careful even in the choice of a

table lamp, for these can be had in forms of exquisite 
beauty. Terra-cotta lamp stands, beautifully embossed and 
colored, are now exceedingly popular. Lamp shades are 
sold in a variety of hues, or white shades are "hovered with

holding a white card beside it and noting whether the 
reflection is darker than the original. Test the thickness 
by lightly tapping with the knuckles. A good glass will

the glass does not distort its objects. 'A poor mirror is a

constant annoyance. Marble tops cost more than others. 
They are liable to injure brittle objects which may be set 
upon them, and the style now is to entirely cover the top 
with various lace goods and other materials of fine texture 
and beautiful color. Wood, hence, is preferable to marble. 

Have a good spring bed covered by a mattress of hair. 
This may cost more at the outset, but it will last long and 
give constant satisfaction. Considering that about one-third 
of life is spent in bed, it is worth while to make the bed the 
best possible. Then, too, our hours of suffering are spent 
there, and there we expect to die. 

In getting up a mattress do not have it in one great mass. 
Do not have it in two long sections, either, as a joint down 
the middle never answers well. Make it in two parts — one 
the square of the bedstead's width, the other to occupy the 
remaining space. The square part can readily be turned 
in the bedstead, so that each side of it shall in turn be at 
the head of the bed. It may then be shifted to the foot 
and the smaller section come to the head. Each part may 
be turned over also, so that a new combination may be 
made each month for a year, and the gullies usually worn 
in mattresses may be wholly avoided. 

Quiet colors are best for the bed-room, both in carpets 
and on the walls. No object should be admitted there that 
is not an object of beauty. What the eye catches last at 
night and first in th^ morning, what it dwells on continu. 
ously in sickness and exhaustion, should be an object in~ 
spiring peace, good-will, and placid joy. Heavy curtains or 
shades are needed at the windows, that light and heat and 
noise maybe excluded when one is sick or needs to sleep in 
daytime. All that is in the sleeping-room should be neat and 
beautiful. Beautiful forms are no more costly than those 
which are homely, and they pay far better, for Keats has 
truly said; 

" A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

Utility may also be happily blended with beauty. What 
could be more beautiful as an article of furniture than 
the parlor cabinet here shown. It contains shelves and 
spaces for ornaments. The carved work is in the highest

But now comes the practical side. An irruption of com- 
pany comes upon you. Or you have not the bedroom you 
really need, and sickness disarranges the natural order. Or

board is disclosed, and all is ready for the making up of the 
bed. The inside measurement of this sumptuous place of 
rest is fifty-two inches by seventy-six. The outside measure- 
ment of the closed cabinet is sixty-six inches by ninety-one. 
This is the Champion Automatic Bedstead, invented and 
made in Philadelphia. It is offered in various sizes and styles 
■ and at various prices. 
But a bedstead does 
not furnish a bed- 
room. True, but this 
beautiful parlor desk, 
which is shown also, 
will do for a wash- 
stand. Throw up its 
top, and you find a 
permanent basin and 
all its proper accom-

open the doors, and 
you find a portable 
reservoir into which 
the waste water drains, 
with drawers for towels 
and othei convenien- 
ces.. This L.'ticle can 
be had in any of the standard woods, and may be finished 
in ebony and gilt if desired. It is fitted with hand-painted 
tiles, and is ornate as well as useful. A still more artistic 
desk washstand is shown on the following page. 

In light, ornamental beauty it cannot be excelled. The 
most inquisitive observer would scarce suspect the extent 
of its practical value. It would detract nothing from the 
beauty of any parlor. Both these stands, or similar ones, 
can be furnished by any good dealer.

What may well be considered a masterpiece, however, is 
ftnown as the "Telescope Bedstead." When opened out.it 
is as complete as that shown a few pages back. When 
closed it appears in various forms. The movement in open- 
ing this bedstead is simply a turning down of the lower 
part of the front so that it lies parallel with the floor. The 
slab or top becomes the foot-board, supported by the side

known as " Combination Fur-

limit to the possibilities of 
such articles. Tables are made 
which can be converted into 
armchairs and writing-desks ; 
children's high chairs are to 
be transformed into low chairs 
with table attachments ; ottomans can be changed into settees 
and armchairs ; an armchair can be adapted for an invalid 
couch or a library chair with reading-stand, writing-desk, etc.; 
and so through unending varieties. The climax in combi^ 
nations is capped, however, by a New York cabinetmaker,

who has exhibited a Secretary, which combines a bedstead, 
writing-desk, bookcase, washstand, wardrobe, medicine-chest, 
secret silver-closet, dressing-bureau, jewelry-case, and, as a 
finial to the whole, a musical and alarm clock. Such a com- 
bination would need a machinist to run it. It is overdone. 

A nursery, or play-room, is indispensable where there are 
children in a home. It should have a hard wood floor, 
with a drugget or rug fastened at its centre. This can be 
removed easily for shaking or washing. Have no curtains 
or drapery in the room. Plain, dark shades will be best at 
the windows, so that light may be excluded wholly or 
admitted freely, as is desirable. A long, low table, the feet 
of which can be folded under, allowing the table to be placed 
out of the way, is just the thing for this room. Toys, books, 
strings, paper, pencils, and a good clock are needed. Have 
low chairs for the little ones as well as higher ones for the 
adults. Hang bright, cheery pictures on -the walls. A 
blackboard and an assortment of colored crayons make lots 
of fun for children. Furnish one room at least where the 
little ones may romp at full liberty. 

Easy chairs and good, comfortable lounges are in place 
almost everywhere. Do not be misled into purchasing the 
stiff, hard, cylindrical affairs on which one can neither sit 
or lie with comfort. Study the picture of a comfortable 
lounge, shown on the preceding page, and get one on that 
principle. The best furniture now shows little or no wood. 
What you save in fancy woods and polish, you can spend 
in upholstery. Try it. Make home so bright, so restful, so 
homelike that no place shall be like home. 

Servants' rooms should be light and well ventilated. 
Good servants will not be satisfied with mean quarters. 
Iron bedsteads are recommended for these rooms but abso- 
lute cleanliness is more important. A bath-room for ser- 
vants is very desirable. Many of them never knew the 
luxury of a thorough bath. 



FOURTH DEPARTMENT. 



Home Decoration. 



To make home what it should be — a cheerful, happy habitation, to which 
, the absent members of a family may look with love, and to which the wan- 
derer will always return with joy — we must have it not only clean, for clean- 
liness is next to godliness, arrd wholesome, which is another way of saying 
holy, but also beautiful. Refinement cannot go with sordidness and ugliness.

Home Decoration. 



NEVER before was there so general an interest in the 
decoration of homes as there is to-day. A truer con- 
ception of what home should be is everywhere pre- 
vailing. It is not a mere barracks, where a family may 
congregate and sleep and eat, but it is a place of enjoyment 
and repose. To this end it must be filled with enjoyable 
and restful things ; and the enjoyment and rest must rise to 
something better than the physical. The best powers of 
the soul must be delighted as they repose at home. Noth- 
ing which offends can be tolerated there. Beauty — which 
in the old Roman tongue was decor — is home's presiding 
genius. To decor-ate home is to bring it under beauty's sway. 
Beauty means fitness, because it always rests upon a basis 
of utility. It is never unmeaning, but can always give a 
reason for its being. The first consideration, hence, is : 
What is good for certain persons, places, and seasons ? 
What is beautiful in a palace is not so in a cottage ; what is 
beautiful at a feast is not so at a funeral. Beauty and fitness 
ever go hand in hand. 

Decorations may be fixed, forming part and parcel of the 
house itself; or they may be portable — capable of change 
in position or of entire removal. There are internal decora- 
tions and those external, and all these need attention. 

423

IN treating of permanent decorations, floors first demand 
attention. What shall we do with our floors ? Floors 
are not merely to walk on. They should please the eye 
continually. Carpeting and oil-cloths have been the time-

Its colors are soon worn off. It beconies puffed into ridges 
and it shrinks from the surroundings. It is at best only a 
patch, a sham. Three superior substitutes for it are now 
offered :

may surpass it in cost. The most beautiful tiles in the world 

are the Minton, man-

country by Sharpless

The elegance of this

pieces and the consequent increase of possibilities for artistic 
effects in their use. Its cost is proportionately greater, of 
course. There are many grades of tiles and mosaics, but 
the best will last a lifetime, and are worth all they cost. 

(3) Inlaid floors are just the thing for dining-rooms and 
other much-used and more public rooms of the house. 
This work may be elaborate and very expensive, or it may 
be plain and of low price. Three methods of preparing 
these floors are followed. The first employs the ordinary 
tongued and grooved boards, laid diagonally or in other 
patterns ; the second kind is made of pieces, usually seven-

eighths of an inch thick, cut and fitted together in blocks of 
any desired patterns, in sections usually twelve or twenty- 
two inches square; the third method is to make up the 
design required from lumber one-quarter of an inch thick, 
glue the edges together, and then glue this pattern to a 
backing of hard wood. These are called veneered floors, 
and this is the style used in all elaborate designs, as it 
admits of much greater variety of patterns than either of 
the other methods. In Europe all such floors are known 
as Parquetry, or Marquetry, and their use is universal in 
the better houses. 



428

A much cheaper and very satisfactory substitute for these 
forums of fancy floor-work is " Wood Carpeting," an inven- 
tion of Mr. E. C. Hussey, an American architect. Agencies

wood. So it is made at a much less cost, and occupies but 
one-quarter of an inch, instead of one inch or more in thick- 
ness, as with thick Parquet. 

The common remark, " A bare floor is so cheerless," 
comes wholly from the impression given by an ordinary 
pine floor with its unsightly cracks, and from not having 
seen the effect of a well-laid Parquet floor, in combination 
with the furniture and other articles in keeping with the 
character of the room in which it is laid. 




SCINDE RUG FOR FLOOR CENTRES. 
[Characterized by borders with angular vine work. Prevailing colors, red, yellow, and bluc.J 

When rugs are used on the floor of a room — as is now 
the prevailing fashion — a border of wood only is laid, into 
which the rug fits exactly. Rug and border are about the 
same thickness, and so the rug is not liable to be displaced 
nor an unaccustomed foot to trip over it. There are three 
ways of finishing these floors. 

1st. By giving them a good soaking coat of " Parquet 
oil." This should be renewed at least once a month. 
Apply with a rag and wipe off" as dry as possible. The

best substitute for " Parquet oil " is five parts of good, light 
mineral oil to one part of good, light Japan. 

2d. By putting on two or three coats of best white shellac

with bay-window projection, 
ornamental corners, etc. The

the bordering, allowing the

with a brush. Plane, scrape, sand-paper, punch the nails 
and putty up in a most thorough manner before shellacing, 
and sand-paper lightly after each coat but the last. 



432 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



3d. By waxing. This is the European plan, and if per- 
severed in, as there, is the best known finish for floors. Use 
pure white beeswax dissolved in best deodorized benzine 
with gentle heat, or in turpentine. Apply while warm to 
the floor with a rag, then polish with a heavy waxing brush 
thoroughly. The brush must be used often and well to get 
and maintain a good polish and the desired smoothness.

t 

Illustrations of wood-carpeting are given, though the fine 
effect of variously colored woods does not appear in a plain 
print. These floors should not be used in vestibules and 
halls, where they are exposed to the weather. Such places 
require marble or tiles which endure exposure and are in 
nowise injured thereby. 

If these methods of beautifying are too expensive, the 
floors may be simply stained and polished. A cheap 



FIXED lATTEH^rAL DECORATIONS. 



43S 



method of securing a neat floor is to cover it tightly with 
muslin and to cover this with an unobtrusive wall-paper. A 
border may be run around the edge and a good coat of var- 
nish added. Dancing would mar such a covering; but if 
rugs be laid in the places of hardest wear, it will serve well 
and last long. This plan is especially adapted to a music- 
room, where clear, distinct sounds are desirable. 

BEAUTIFUL WALLS. 

After the floors, the walls come in for consideration. 
When papers can be had 
at prices so low and in 
styles so elegant as now, 
bare, cold walls in white- 
wash or paint are inex- 
cusable. Indeed, they 
are extravagant — for 
better results can be had 
for far less expense. So 
elaborate have paper- 
hangings become that 
they are in great part 
supplanting the fresco- 
work formerly so much 
used in elegant houses. 
Wall hangings are offer- 
ed at from eight or ten 
cents to twenty and 
twenty-five dollars a 
roll. Just now the pre- 
vailing taste is to the 
quieter forms and col- 
ors. The following illustration of a ceiling decoration in 
paper is from one of the most artistic establishments of New 
York. The quiet elegance of its forms are seen at a glance 




ORNAMENTAL FRIEZE PATTERNS. 
[Design by Fr. Beck & Co., New York.] 



434 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



and the color effects would heighten it greatly. The lead- 
ing producers of paper-hangings are sparing no pains to 
produce results which shall in all respects be artistic and 
elegant. One house offered three prizes, respectively of 
;g 1,000, ;^SOO, and ;^25o, for the best designs. The result 
was the selection of three offerings, all of them combining 
an idea from nature, a water idea, a beehive idea, etc., and 
all of them conspicuous for rich simplicity and artistic effect. 
As illustrative of beautiful frieze patterns, two sekctions 
from the choicest patterns now offered are shown in cuts 
above. An elegant Easter Lily pattern, also for frieze work, 

is shown in the adjoin- 
ing engraving. But 
these are samples only. 
The variety is wide as 
the freaks and fancies 
of genius. Indeed, the 
genius of the past is 
laid under contribution 
also to beautify our 
19th-century homes. 
Antique forms are 
much in demand, and 

EASTER LILY PATTERN FOR FRIEZE. t^g very ruiuS of the 

world have been scoured to furnish suggestions for modern 
decoration. The trouble with these strange forms is that it 
is hard to make them harmonious with the other appoint- 
ments of the room. If there is an Egyptian or Chinese or 
Japanese room wherein the peculiarities of these nations are 
the dominating motive, then you have an harmonious effect. 
Such a result is artistic. But a Japanese banner, on a Chi- 
nese paper, with a French ceiling, a Turkish rug, and 
American furniture, is too much of a mongrel to be in- 
dorsed by good taste. 

In fine wall decorations there are many specialties. Em-

bossed papers are well known, and they are constantly im- 
proving in style. New materials have appeared also, chief 
among which is " Lincrusta-Walton " — a preparation of 
ground cork and linseed oil. This has the tenacity and 
flexibility of leather. It can be bent around any curve and 
it will endure the hardest wear. In its preparatory state it 
is subjected to heavy pressure under molded rollers, whereby 
its upper surface is brought out in bold relief, while its under

surface remains entirely smooth, so promoting its facility of 
adhesion to the wall. The relief-efTect on this substance 
may be made very prominent. It also takes coloring beauti- 
fully and becomes as enduring as the wall itself. It is the 
invention of Mr. Frederick Walton, an English architect, 
and is now made for this country at Stamford, Conn., and is 
6oid by first-class paper-hangers everywhere. 

Lincrusta-Walton has been largely used, both abroad and 
in this country, in palaces, mansions, country houses,

theatres, hospitals, churches, hotels, clubs, and other public 
and private buildings ; also in yachts, in the vessels of the 
British Navy, and of the Cunard, Inman, White Star, British 
Indian, and other steamship lines. Wherever the effects of

carving are desired, Lincrusta- Walton is in demand. " Noth- 
ing less than stern necessity," says a writer on this article, 
" should compel an architect to forego, in interiors, the in-

addition to the ordinary methods of pleasing the eye by 
colors and lines. It is only necessary to see the interiors of 
grand French buildings, with their admirable moldings, or 
the Gothic carvings of Belgian town halls and old English 
cathedral choirs, to appreciate the unapproachable refine- 
ment and beauty of work in relief" 

The advantages of Lincrusta- Walton have been thus sum- 
marized : " For the interior decoration of houses its warm

and comfortable surface makes it peculiarly applicable. It 
has no glaze to break up and reflect the light with the cold 
glitter of Dutch tiles, nor does the moisture of the air con- 
dense upon its surface, unless water is present in excessive 
quantities in the atmosphere. It is not warped, cast, eaten 
by worms, or pulverized like wood. It does not become 
ice-cold in winter and hot in summer, like stone and terra- 
cotta. It does not absorb moisture and give it out again, 
like uncovered brick and plaster, On the contrary, it offers

ail impermeable resistance to wet from within or without, 
and if the air within is so dangerously damp as to communi- 
cate moisture to the walls. Lincrusta-Walton does not con- 
ceal the effect by absorbing the moisture." 

A substance termed " Gerveta " is coming into' use for 
high grades of decoration. Its general effects are like those 
of Lincrusta, but more bold and prominent, as Gerveta is 
applied to the walls in a pulpy state and is there worked by 
molds and tools. It may also be worked separately, though 
to work it on the wall is deemed preferable, securing more 
perfect adhesion and bolder effects. 

The substances just named have great possibilities in 
artistic hands. Paneled ceilings and covered walls ; doors 
and door-jambs inset with these preparations ; wainscoting 
and heavy furniture, similarly adorned ; fire screens, picture 
frames, newel posts, and lighter decorations, resplendent 
with a variety of patterns and colors, are some of the uses 
of these wares. Inquiry concerning these goods should be 
made by all parties interested in extensive or even incidental 
decorations. 

Fresco paintings were the dominant mural decorations of 
the world until a somewhat recent day. The artists of St. 
Peter's, St. Paul's, and other grand structures are immor- 
talized by that class of v.^ork. It is seldom now that homes 
are frescoed throughout. Ceilings are often finished thus 
in part, or even entire, for the sake of the freedom and grace 
thus attainable. The best of papers must, to a great degree, 
be set and formal ; but in fresco there are no limits, save in 
the capacity of the artist or the purse of his customer. For 
home walls, at least, this art has suffered decline. Mjore 
effective decoration can be had in other ways, especially for 
private houses. 

But the highest style of wall decoration demands some- 
thing more elegant than either paper or paint. Silks, satins, 
and laces fill this requirement. Silk or satin decorations

FIXED I2\lTEJiI^AL DECORATIONS.

are attached to light frames, over which mushn is stretched 
as a basis. These frames fit the wall closely from wain- 
scoting to cornice. Silk may be stretched smoothly on 
these frames, or it may be fluted, or gathered to a central 
rosette, or worked "in any other beautiful design. To pad 
the silk into a light cushion and tuft it is very elegant. 
This silk finish may remain uncovered, or, from a rod at the 
cornice, Gobelin laces or 
other tapestries may hang 
to a point a little below 
the top of the wainscoting. 
The combinations of ma- 
terial, colors, and graceful 
forms which may be pro- 
duced in this style of work 
are-numberless. The silks 
may be plain, watered, or 
figured; they may be of 
one color or of many har- 
monizing colors in stripes ornamental moorish ceiling. 
of greater or less width. The laces may be of various quali- 
ties and patterns, and may hang free, or be draped apart in 
sections, or be fluted close to the foundation-silk or satin. 

Carving also lends its aid to the decoration of walls, ceil- 
ings, doors, door-jambs, window frames, etc. Papier-mache 
and stucco produce very satisfactory results in this direc- 
tion ; but imitations are not admitted in first-class mansions. 
Genuine hard woods, carved by hand, are required there. 
John La Farge, the New York decorator, spent ;^ 100,000

A hundred thousand dollars can soon be spent on one

elaborate carvings ; where door-heads are networks of ex- 
quisite chiseling in the rarest and richest woods; where

Lamps, too, are wrought into very elegant forms. They 
may adorn as well as illuminate our homes, and are adapted 
for halls, parlors, and all other apar):njents. 

Stained-glass windows present one of the richest effects 

in ornamentation. They 
have been in use since 
the sixth century, and 
have ever held their su- 
premacy with lovers of 
the beautiful. Objects 
presented -by stained 
glass are shown by 
transmitted light in all 
the fullness and richness 
of their colors. Objects 
presented by reflected 
light, as when one views 
pictures and solid orna- 
ments, are to some ex- 
tent shorn of their rich 
coloring. Thesurround- 
ing white light produces 
somewhat of grayness 
on all colors. To test 
this, notice the shade of 
a delicate leaf when seen 
only by reflected light ; 
then hold it between the 
eye and the sunlight so 
as to see its coloring by 
means of transmission. 
The fine effect of stained-glass windows is heightened by 
the dark lines of the sash-bars about the several pieces of 
glass. These serve to intensify the rich colorings, which 
diffuse through the apartment a warm, genial, brilliant glow. 




PATTERN FOR STAINED-GLASS WINDOW.

The glass throughout a house should be made appropriate 
for its particular position, and so add a greater charm to 
such beautiful work. In the vestibule- doors, words of greet- 
ing ; in the dining-room, fruits, flowers, fishes, etc. General 
pieces may adorn the 
sitting-rooms, etc., two 
samples of which, from 
a series representing the 
seasons, suitable for any 
apartment, are given as 
illustrations of outline 
merely, the charm of 
color being absent. 
Where a single piece of 
stained-glass work is 
wanted, nothing could 
be better than a hand- 
some fire-screen, which 
in the daytime catches 
the reflecting lights, 
and in the evening is 
lit up by the open fire- 
place. Such a piece is 
always handsome and 
never out of fashion. 

The American de- 
parture in glass marks 
a new era, and by the 
use of new forms of 
(glass, as the "irides- 
'cent," " opalescent," " Venetian," " Florentine," and many 
others, more brilliant and artistic results have been obtained 
than ever before. To the architect, these glasses furnish 
the richest of all decorations ; to the artist, they present a 
wide field for sacred, historical, and heraldic illustrations;

to the householder, they offer one of the best means of 
making home attractive. A judicious expenditure for 
stained glass will prove the correctness of the old adage, 
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever." 




IMITATION STAINED-GLASS DESIGNS FOR TRANSOMS. 

The costliness of stained glass is a great objection to its 
use. This varies in proportion to the quality of glass used, 
richness of design, smallness of pieces, numerousness of 
"jewels," etc. For home uses, what is known as " Imita- 
tion Stained Glass" is a very satisfactory substitute. It is 
made of thin, translucent sheets of richly colored and 
elegantly designed papers, closely imitating the genuine 
stained glass. It is durable, inexpensive, and easily applied

to any window. It is covefed by an American patent, and 
can be had in the prominent cities of dealers and decorators, 
who also can apply it if desired. Four outline designs of this 
preparation are given 
to illustrate its styles. 
The transoms show 
combinations which 
may readily be 
worked into other 
forms. They are 
composed of borders, 
grounds, and centres, 
either of which can 
be used in an end- 
less variety of ways. 
The library window 
shows the combina- 
tion applied to the 
entire opening. The 
emblem of wisdom is 
appropriate here. In 
a dining-room win- 
dow, birds, fruits, or 
game would suit bet- 
ter. In a parlor, mu- 
sic and flowers, or the 
Muses, the Graces, 
etc., would be more 
at home. The panel 
pattern shown on the 
page next following 
is suitable for any 
door, being beautiful, but not of decided characteristics. 
A French preparation, " Diaphanie," is offered for the 
?ame purpose ; also, " Glacier," an American patented

article. In the Diaphanie French skill appears, and the 
designs are of great and beautiful pictorial variety, including 
ooats-of-arms, religious subjects, landscapes, fruits, flowers, 

historic and chivalric subjects, 
etc., etc. The leading papermen 
and decorators anywhere can 
refer to agents for Diaphanie. 
Glacier can be had of paint and 
glass dealers generally. Proba- 
bly the best method js to combine 
these several preparations, select- 
ing from each that which is best 
suited to the specific work pro- 
posed. Great opportunity for the 
exercise of good taste is afforded 
in the use of these materials. 

With home windows in the 
ordinary form, a very happy effect 
is produced by covering the up- 
per half with imitations of stained 
glass (unless, indeed, the genuine 
article be used), and then hanging 
the window shade for the lower 
half only. This shade should be 
dense and not brilliant in color, 
so that all the light of the room 
shall take its mellowing from 
the colors above. An upper shade 
may be used to exclude glare. 
The excellence of all stained glass 
effects depends on transmitting all ■ the light. Reflected 
light always detracts from the beauty of stained glass.

II.— PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 

THERE are important decorations in the home which 
are not part of the house itself. They are personal 
property, not real estate. They are carried with their 
owner in his migrations and are adapted to each new 
resting place he may find. Of these we may discuss, first : 

CARVINGS, PICTURES, AND CURTAINS. 




RICHLY DECORATED APARTMENT. 

In the hallway there may be carvings, statuary, or vases. 
The stag's head or horns is much used in this situation— 

451 



452

rather too much, indeed. A buffalo's head is too heavy 
and beastly for a beautiful home. Armorial carvings are 
light and ornamental as wall decorations, but real armor is 
better. In a hallway it is suggestive of romance; for as we 
leave hats, canes, and riding-whips in the hall, ready for use 
as we pass out, so the olden knights left swords, helmets, 
and battle-axes there, ready to be used at a moment's 
notice. On the same principle, ancient arms or historic 
weapons may be there, though the peaceful home-tastes of 
most people prefer more quiet emblems. The Alpen-stocks, 
now so popular with mountain tourists, may properly rest 
with other trophies of travel in the main hallway. 





POLISHED BRASS UMBRELLA AND CANE STANDS. 

Ideal fitness must rule in all decoration. Because in 
conflict with it, pictures are rarely in place in hallways. 
You can seldom get a standpoint from which to view them 
properly, and it is a farce to locate pictures where their 
effect is lost. On this ideal fitness, the old family clock is 
properly placed in the hallway, where it may mark the 
incomings and the outgoings, and where it will sound out

the passing hours for all in the house. Longfellow, who, 
more than any of our poets, touched the heart and home- 
life of our people, had his old clock on the stairs and in 
his hall the bust of Washington, who once made his head- 
quarters in that very house. There are pictures in the 
hallway there and on the landings ; but they are little gems 

which need close ""'"'" ""'"' ~ 

observation, and 
can be fully seen. 

In the dining- 
room, decorations 
may be held to 
the five F's — 
namely. Fish, 
Flesh, Fowl, 
Fruits, Flowers 
These may be m 
carved work or m i 
paintings, either i» 
fixed or movable 
mottoes are used on 
ing-room walls, which is by 
no means to be advised, do seek 
one different from " Eat, Drink, 
and be Merry," and other convm 
tional platitudes which are 
common in the cheap boarding-houses 

In the sitting and sleeping 
rooms the eternal fitness of_ 
things mustbeobserved. Ease sIIirwayof^thelongfellow 

and pleasure are desirable 

here, and articles which promote them are always in order. 
But such articles have their own character, and should be 
located accordingly. There are articles for the parlor, 
others for the dining-room, and so throughout the house

THE ffO USE WIRE'S LIBRARY. 



A piano is not for fit the bed-room, though a music-box 
maybe allowed there. Nor are superb paintings for bed- 
rooms, but for more public places. Where there are many- 
fine paintings, it is worth while to have a picture gallery or 
apartment where lovers of art may sit undisturbed and 
enjoy their favorites. Much of a collection of fine paintings 
is a luxury permitted to but few, as none but millionaires 
can hold the celebrated pieces. But from these costly 
works there is a gradually descending scale till the little,

inexpensive gems of true art — such as Prang, of Boston, 
furnishes — are reached. These are artistic and exquisite. 
They charm and elevate, and one such is worth far more 
than a roomful of daubs, such as wandering auctioneers and 
artistic tramps hawk about. 

A beautiful illustration of fitness in decoration is afforded 
in the rrrusic-room of a wealthy musical gentleman of Cin- 
cinnati. He has there 'a grand organ, two pianos, a cabinet 
organ, a harp, and many other musical instruments, together

with pictures of the masters and curious musical instruments 
of other days and lands. In the ground-glass transom of 
the entrance-door the opening strain of " Home, Sweet 
Home " is wrought. Over the 
grand organ the opening strain of 
the " Hallelujah Chorus " is fres- 
coed in the cove of the cornice, at 
other points of which snatches of 
other celebrated compositions are 
wrought so delicately as to escape 
casual observation, and yet so 
beautifully as to charm every artistic 
eye which catches them. 

All living things turn toward the 
light. The bright side of a room 
is that most seen. The parts next 
the windows are those for special 
effect. A mirror between windows 
is condemned by some critics. One 
says : " People of taste . . . some- 
times put mirrors in this spot. 
Philistines always do." But the 
poorest light of the room is just 
there. An observer at that point is 
dazzled with the radiance on either 
side and cannot see clearly what 
stands between. A mirror there, 
however, reflects the illuminated 
objects of the room, and does so 
all the more from receiving no direct light itself Put a 
mirror between the windows, therefore. In front of it a 
piece of statuary will be seen to advantage by direct and 
reflected views. This may to some extent obscure the 
mirror, but in a parlor its use is not as a, dressing-glass, 
but to beautify and enlarge the room.

In the front corners of the room, statuary, jardinieres with 
flowers, or any beautiful objects which are high, but not 
broad, are appropriate. Statuary should alAvays be shown 
against a suitable background — very 
dark for white marble and bright 
colors for the Rogers' groups or 
other dark-colored pieces. 

When statuettes are used upon 
brackets or cabinets, this principle 
must be observed. On ebony a pure, 
white ornament is splendid. Bronze 
shows to best advantage on white. 
Dark walls are best for gold frames 
and rich-colored paintings. 

Do not feel compelled to make 
each article of an apartment balance 
with some other article. Irregularity 
is more natural than regularity. The 
finest mosaics are purposely made 
irregular to avoid the " machine- 
made" appearance. Do not square 
your chairs with the walls ; do not 
set them at one inevitable angle. Do 
not keep things forever in one place. 
Nature is free in her forms and her 
movements, and the highest art 
walks lovingly with her. 
Changes in arrangement come from various demands. 
Persons weary of one style. " Variety is the spice of life." 
Even a less elegant change is preferable for a time to stolid 
grandeur. The march of improvement, too, demands 
change. Competition in fabrics of all kinds begets improve- 
ment. Better goods come into the markets continuously, 
crowding out the old and the inferior and making place for 
the new and the better.

It has become quite popular, ahd deservedly so on rriany 
accounts, to curtain doorways as shown in the cut. Where 

there are shding 
doois they remain 
to be used when 
required. Hinged 
doors are usually 
removed entirely 
when curtains are 
employed. In an 
arched doorway 
the curtain should 
hang from a rod 
on a level with the 
spring of the arch; 
unless, indeed, the 
opening lead into 
a cold apartment, 
from which chill- 
ing drafts might 
come. For such 
an opening, how- 
ever, a more solid 
door seems best. 
Rods and rings of 
polished wood are 
the proper articles 
for these uses. Metal rings are not now used with curtains. 
The material of the curtaining may be as varied as the 
tastes and purses of parties demand. Curtaining doorways 
is, however, a movement in the direction of luxury and 
beauty. It should express itself, therefore, in elegant, if 
not sumptuous, forms. 

Real elegance can assert itself in many ways. The 
carpetings, the wall papers, the curtains; the substantial

such surroundings there is a grand inspiration to personal 
elegance. Our surroundings and ourselves are part and 
parcel of one great whole. It is not we that make our 
surroundings merely, but our • surroundings in turn make 
us. We are molded by the things we mold. The very 
act of fashioning beautiful forms forms us into beautiful 
fashion. And so the peep at elegance, as given in the cut, 
is without any inelegant detractions.

A pen picture of the private apartments of the President 

of the United States will be of interest. The sleeping-room 




of His Excellency is a model of tasteful and rich furnishing. 
The curtains, carpets, portieres, and paper of this room are 
of a pale-blue tint, commonly known as pigeon-egg blue,

and the furniture, with the exception of the bedstead, 
corresponds with the other appointments. 

Adjoining this room is the private study of the President. 
Surrounded by books of choice engravings, photographs of 
intimate friends, and articles of vertu indescribable — a cozier 
nook could not have been selected, and the view ori all sides 
is charming. 

Passing out of the study into a large hall, one is impressed 
by the magnificent surroundings. Several of the best works 
of Bierstadt adorn the walls, a large painting of the Yellow- 
stone region being the most striking. A unique and 
handsome cigar-stand, formed of the head of a Texas calf 
and three steers' horns, highly polished and mounted in 
silver, is placed near a favorite lounging-place of the Presi- 
dent. A large, semi-circular window of French plate, 
surmounted by jeweled designs in glass, is at the end of 
this apartment, and the perfume of the choicest flowers in 
the conservatory beneath scents the air. Easy chairs, 
lounges, and tete-a-tetes are scattered through the hall and 
invite delicious rest from the affairs of state. 

A large, carved door opens from the hall into the bed- 
room at the southwest angle of the mansion, in which the 
late President Garfield suffered. A communicating door 
opens Into the large room used by the doctors in attendance 
upon the stricken President. The most notable article in 
this apartment is a handsomely carved mahogany bedstead, 
bearing in bold relief the coat-of-arms of the United States, 
the whole surmounted by a heavy red silk canopy. A pair 
of steps lead up to the bed, upon which are four mattresses, 
topped off" by a feather bed. The furniture of the room is 
of a heavy, sombre, antique pattern. This furniture is 
valued at thousands of dollars and is the only thing about 
the mansion which connects the past with the present. 

Another pen-picture, showing some of the elegancies of 
the house of William H. Vanderbilt — the grandest private 



PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 4(51 

mansion of America — will be welcome. The hall is sixty- 
feet deep by twenty wide. In the centre, upon the right 
side, is the grand staircase, down whose broad flight the 
daylight streams, mellowed through stained-glass Venetian 
windows. Opposite the staircase, in the hall, is a splendid 
fireplace. The andirons are of iron hammered into artistic 
shape and furnished with chains. Five torches, with wax 
candles, give brilliancy to the hall by night. The candles 
are held in bronze branches which spring from bronze 
columns, up which Cupids climb. The walls are wainscoted 
with Caen stone, elaborately carved, the panels separated 
by classic pilasters and decorated with scroll work. A 
drapery of Oriental silk hangs above the stone-work, 
embroidered with figures of birds. The mantel-piece of this 
hall is a wondrous work of art, made of Caen stone and 
ornamented with superb carving. Looking from this fire- 
place up the staircase, the eye meets the twelve Caesars in 
two stained windows, each on topaz-colored medallions on 
a ground of ruby red. Between the two windows stand 
female saints in carved wood, with carved pedestals and 
arching canopies. The side-wall and the balustrade are of 
Caen stone, the balusters being of acanthus leaves termi- 
nating in dragons' heads. 

At the end of the hall is the dining-room, thirty-five feet 
wide and fifty-four feet long, its ceiling of dark, carved wood 
thirty-two feet above its floor. In a deep recess at the 
western end of the room is a stained-glass window of 
enormous size, representing the meeting of Henry VIII of 
England with Francis I of France. Four chandeliers hang 
from the groined ceiling. Here, too, is a huge fireplace of 
richly carved stone and terra cotta. The walls are covered 
with Venetian gilt and colored leather. A frieze above the 
mantel of the fireplace in the dining-room represents sea- 
nymphs and Cupid sporting in the waters and playing with 
sea-horses and seals, Above this is a solid work of carved oak.

The drawing-room is thirty-four feet wide by forty feet 
long. The walls are paneled in cream color, with gilt 
moldings, and on the doors hang hunting trophies of gilt. 
The doors once belonged to an old French chateau. The 
fireplace is of two marbles, super-ornamented with heavy 
bronzes. The ceiling is adorned with the fresco work of 
Baudry, of Paris, representing Olympus and its gods and 
goddesses. The ceiling is circular in form arid, the corners 
are filled with triangular panels, in which are figures of 
Cupid. A large mirror is set in the paneling above the

before the entrance. 

The Japanese room of this mansion is superb as the

while around the lower portion .is cabinet work, tinted in 
rich red lacquer. On each side of the door a life-size

DECORATIONS FROM NATURE. 

Home decoration owes an immense debt to flowers. These 
beautiful adornments are so free, so fragrant, so varied, 
and such favorites with all, that every true home should 
be brightened by them. Granting that it be a city home, 
with no lawn, no trees, no extended flower beds, still, 
within the house, by a little skill and care, beauty may be 
made to smile the year through. While snow and sleet 
reign without, buds and blossoms may reign within. 

The cut below is a bright illustration of what may be in 
any home by careful window gardening. 




A window for flowers must 
be upon the sunny side of 
the house. Unless the sashes 
fit unusually tight, a double sash will be needed for 
the winter, as the winds will almost certainly penetrate 
the room and nin thp tpnrlpr nlanfc If the heat of the

THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



room fall off during the night, this danger will be greatly 
increased. And yet an arrangement must be made for an 
abundance of fresh air. Want of oxygen is as fatal to plants 
as to people. 

The equipment for such a window garden as this cut rep- 
resents are few, simple, and inexpensive. Hanging-baskets 
are innumerable in style and price, as will be illustrated in 
the pages beyond. Wire flower stands are very pretty, sub- 
stantial, and cheap. Flower-pots may be had in all styles. 
The old-fashioned earthern pots cost very little. It was 
once thought they were the only ones which, by virtue of 
their porous character, would effectually promote plant 
growth. But that idea was erroneous. You may paint the 
pots, so beautifying them even while you destroy their 
porosity ; or you may use any of the many forms of glazed 
and ornamented pots now offered at the stores. 




VARIETIES IN FLOWER-POTS. 

What actually has been done in Bay-window Gardening 
is shown in the next cut, which is from a photograph. The 
floor of this bay-window is finished in hard wood. This is 
desirable, as it allows free watering of the plants without 
damage to carpets. An oil-cloth covering, or a floor laid 
with tile, neither of which need cost much, answer well. It 
is a good plan to have a hard-wood floor laid upon the 



PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS.

regular floor, thus making the bay-window flooring slightly 
higher than the main floor. A tenant may make this por- 
table, so as to be easily removed, if need be. 




THE BAY-WINDOW GARDEN, 

The pots in this window are placed directly on the floor. 
The corner pots contain ivy vines, which are trained up the 
wood-work and across the window head with very pretty 
effect. The strip on the floor, around the pots, is merely 
to give a good finish to the outline of the room. It may be 
movable or permanent, as is desired. The plants to be 
used must be selected by advice of a florist, who knows the 
exact possibilities of the locality. Houses have peculiarities, 
also, which must be discovered. The purse, too, needs con- 
sultation, for from very inexpensive plants one may rise to 
those of finest character and highest cost. Birds, vases, 
hanging-baskets, and other elements of such gardens will 
be discussed hereafter. One thing must be remembered, 
however, in this connection, namely : A bay-window gar- 



466

den cannot be used for much else. It cannot be a play- 
ground, a smoking-room, or a lounging-place, though it 
makes a beautiful sitting-place for the ladies in their mo- 
ments of leisure. 

No advice as to the care of plants for a window gardea 
will apply everywhere. The best way is to consult local 
florists who are successful, and to observe carefully your 
own experiences. Generally speaking, the best flower for the

house is the geranium. It requires but little care, is never 
troubled with green fly or red spider,^ stands a dry atmos- 
phere well, and blooms profuselyi- Heliotropes and bego- 
nias are easily grown and are good bloomers. Callas will 
grow well almost anywhere if they get plenty of water. The 
ivy is well fitted for use in the house. Fuchsias are exqui- 
site flowers for summer use, but do not bloom well in winter. 
For fall use nothing is better than the chrysanthemums. 
After these have blossomed the plants can be put in the

cellar. Carnations, abutilons, oleanders, and myrtles are all 
adapted to culture in the house, and generally give excellent 
satisfaction. It is always best to confine attention at first to 
such plants as are not too particular. When you can grow 
these well, try other kinds. Do not attempt too much, but do 

your best 

with what 

you start. 

One good 

plant is 

a treasure. 

A dozen 

poor ones 

are worse 

than none 

at all. They lead a 

poor, sickly life that is 

a pleasure to neither 

the cultivator nor the 

beholder. 

Surprising results 
may be attained by 
special care. The ad- 
joining cut shows the 
appearance of a house- 
grown lily of the val-

condition here shown in five weeks. Of course, it had, 
skillful and constant care, but it had no advantage of hot- 
house or special accessory. Its chief forcing was on the 
reservoir of a kitchen cook-stove. 

On the use of vines in the house an expert says : " There 

is nothing in the way of home decorations that may be had 

■with so little expense, managed with so little trouble, or will 

give results so satisfactory, as the ivy. There is no room so,

palatial to which it may not add embellishment, and it will 
give an air of cheerfulness aftd refinement to the one room 
of the settler's log-cabin. Of course, we refer to the true 
evergreen ivy, Hedera, and not to the tender plants known 
as ' Parlor,' ' German,' ' Colosseum,' and other ivies. If 
one has a sprig of ivy and a pot or a box of earth, wonders 
can be accomplished if the owner possesses one other requi- 
site — patience. The growth is slow at first, but it is in- 
creasingly rapid, and each year the plant will reward patient 
care by becoming more beautiful and 
more valuable." 

Boxes for window gardens, with 
casters for ease of movement, may be 
constructed by any person. One of 
the prettiest may be made by covering 
the box with pieces of bark nailed up- 
right on its sides, sawed off at the top 
and bottom edges, and then making 
the supporting stand and overarching 
trellis of saplings. Vine stems may be 
trailed over the rustic work and fast- 
ened there. The effect of growing 
flowers and vines on such a rustic 
stand is very beautiful. 

Some plants show to best advantage 
when separated from others and in positions not favorable 
for the display of ordinary plants. For example : For 
brackets the best plants we have are the drooping varieties 
of fuchsias, the eupatorium and begonias. No one knows 
what grace there is in the fuchsia unless he has seen it grow- 
ing on a bracket placed about as high as his- head, the 
branches being allowed to droop over the pot. To secure 
plenty of branches, the centre of the plant should be pinched 
out when it is small. Where one stalk was there will be 
two shoots thrown out. These, in turn, should be pinched

back, and at least a dozen thrifty stalks should be induced 
to grow from the base of the plant. No piece of statuary 
can make a more elegant filling for a corner. Eupatorium 
Mexicanum blends beautifully with fuchsias on two-pot 
brackets, and the effect is more than 
doubled if placed in front of a mirror. 
One of the most tasty decorations 
is a bouquet or basket of flowers, or 
even a single beautiful rose, lily, or 
hyacinth. Small vases for these can 
be had in abundance at all prices. 
Miniature gypsy kettles, with flowers , 
of delicate form and size, are exceed- 
ingly beautiful on a mantel or bracket. 
Artificial flowers may be used thus, 
but they must be small and exquisite, not large or gaudy. 

To "make a bunch of flowers" is no trouble, but to make 
a bouquet or tastefully fill a basket of flowers is a high art 
Arranging flowers loosely and naturally in vases, saucers, 
and other ornamental receptacles requires 
good taste and some knowledge of the 
harmony of colors. To fill a basket, first 
line it with tin foil, or scatter a little lyco- 
podium or other green material, to form 
a lining. Over this put a lining of strong 
paper. Then fill the basket with damp 
sawdust, rounding it off'at the top and cov- 
ering with damp moss, inserting the stems 
of the flowers in the moss. If the natural 
stems are not suitable for this work, the 
flowers can be " stemmed," that is, fastened to small pieces 
of wood or broom splints. It is well to make the border 
of drooping green. Fuchsias border very elegantly. 

Few flowers have stems suitable for bouquet work ; so it 
is the custom to " stem " all flowers for this purpose. These

470 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

stiff steams can be made to hold the flowers in any position 
desired. To keep the flowers from crowding each other 
and to supply moisture, wind damp moss 
around the stem at its connection with the 
artificial stem. The central flower, which 
should be the largest, must have a stiff", 
strong, straight stem, which really forms the back- 
bone of the bouquet as well also as the handle. 
Fasten the stems of all the smaller flowers around 
this main, central flower. After the flowers are all 
properly attached and the bouquet is well formed, 
cut off the entire handle to the desired length and 
cover it with tin-foil, or wind it with white ribbon, 
leaving a loop, so that the bouquet may be sus- 
pended by it if desired. 
STEMMED Ornamental papers can be obtained at a very

small cost which will cover the handle and bot- 
tom of the bouquet and also make a richly ornamental 
border. These hints apply, of course, to hand bouquets, 
but larger bouquets are 
made in the same manner, 
except that they are more 
pyramidal in form. 

If ferns or flowers for ornamental bouquet paper. 
bouquets or other work are laid in water for several hours 
after being cut and before they are used, they will endure 
much longer without flagging than if immediately arranged. 
The more water they absorb after being severed from the 
plant, the better they will stand. 

A new device for the arrangement of flowers consists of a 
piece of cork about a quarter of an inch thick, circular in 
form, and perforated with holes, like the rose of a watering- 
pot. The diameter of the cork is made to correspond to 
the size of the saucer or shallow dish with which it is to be 
■•ised. The cork, floating on the top of the water, supports 




DECORA TIONS FROM NA TURE. 471 

the flowers, whose stems are inserted through the holes. 
For the display of small flowers and those having short 
stems this method is well adapted. It may possibly be 
better than damp sand, as the cork may be preserved and 
will always be ready, even when sand cannot be had. 

The Ladies' Floral Cabinet lays down the following rule^ 
on bouquet-making : " Never put more than three varieties 
or colors in the same vase or bouquet, and let those colors 
be such as perfectly harmonize. Arrange the flowers so 
that each one can be seen entire." This is good, but 
exceptions are numerous. 

Autumn leaves, which are a deservedly popular decora- 
tion, require but little preparation. When fully ripe they 
contain very little moisture and the colors are quite perma- 
nent ; but they contain some moisture, and may curl up if 
brought into a warm room. To prevent this, place them 
between papers, giving a light pressure. In a few days take 
them out and give a light dressing of varnish to brighten 
the colors. For this purpose, clear, boiled linseed oil is 
good, using the least possible amount Some prefer balsam 
fir, cut with alcohol ; others use gum shellac dissolved in 
alcohol ; others dip each leaf in melted wax and press it a 
moment with a warm iron. 

It is stated that the colors of flowers may be preserved by 
dipping them occasionally in a boiled solution of eleven 
grains of salycilic acid in a pint of water and afterward care- 
fully drying them between sheets of blotting paper. 

There are several methods of drying flowers so as to 
preserve their color to some degree. The most common 
way is to spread them in a pan of dry sand and sift sand 
upon them, keeping them, when thus covered, in a warm, 
dry place for several days, until free from moisture ; or they 
may be dried between thin sheets of wadding placed be- 
tween two pieces of glass. The pressing will injure the 
form ; but this is more or less so by any process.

The field for ingenuity and taste here opened is very 
broad and is well worth diligent cultivation. 

Floral or evergreen letterings are often desired. Mark 
out the letters on strawboard, placing them close together, 

I as in diagram No. i. If no 
expert in lettering is available, 
I determine the height you wish 
I the letters to be, and divide that 
into six equal parts, marking 
these on the strawboard. Cross 
these with other lines at the 
same distances apart. The pro- 
portions so given will answer for most letters, six spacea 
high by four wide, and will suggest 
the proportions for others, as in dia- 
gram No. 2. 

When thus marked, cut each letter 
clearly with shears or knife, and cover 
them by tying with dark thread or sewing the green and 
flowers to the surfaces. Keep the work even and trim its 
edges when done. Everlasting flowers or bright berries 
should be mixed with the green to relieve the uniformity. 
Moss may be tied upon the letters ; into this flowers with 
paste or glue upon their stems may be stuck, and they will 

remain fixed, showing a 
result as in diagram No. 3. 
Glue will hold some cover- 
ings of letters sufficiently. 
Immortelles, Pampas 
' plumes, ferns, oats, with 
many weeds and grasses, are well suited for drying. Vases, 
baskets, and wall-pockets may be filled with them and 
serve well as decorations. The unnatural coloring frequently 
put upon these grasses by dealers is a monstrosity. Better 
retain the natural conditions when natural objects are used.

Holiday decorations of ivy, laurel, holly, ferns, mosses, 
and the whole range of evergreens are beautiful if well done. 
Picture frames, window curtains, doorways, mantel-pieces — 
indeed, any and every part of a room — may 
be made cheery and elegant by this means. 
It consumes time, but it cultivates taste. 

A few little floral fancies are worthy of 
passing mention in closing this subject. 

1. To grow a pretty vine from the sweet 
potato : Put a tuber in pure sand, or sandy 
loam, in a hanging-basket, and water occa- 
sionally. It will throw out tendrils and ^^||^^^ 
beautiful leaves, and climb freely over the 
arms of the basket and upward toward the 
top of the window. 

2. Procure a fine, healthy acorn and cro- 
chet around it a little network case after re^ 
moving the cup. Then hang it, point down- 
ward, in a deep glass, having so much water 
in it that the point of the acorn just reaches it. Keep it in a 

dark closet until 
it has sprouted ; 
then put it in the 
light. A chest- 
nut thus kept in 
water will sprout 
in the same way, 
and either will be 
beautiful. 

3. Cutofifeven- 
ly the top of a 
carrot and place 
it on the top of a 
pot full of sand, 
so that the leaves look as if they sprang from it. Moisten

it well and keep it in the dark until it has begun to sprout y 
keep it damp, and move it into the light when the leaves 
appear. If the cultivation is successful, an ornament pretty 
enough for any room will be the result. 

4. Take a sound turnip and clean the outside, taking care 
not to injure the part from whence the leaves spring. Cut 

I a piece off the bottom 
and scoop out the 
inside. Fasten string 
or wire to it, so that 
it can be hung up. 
Fill the cavity, and 
keep it filled, with 
water. In a short 
time the leaves will 
sprout and curl up 
toward the ball of the 
turnip, forming a 
beautiful miniature 
hanging-basket. 

5. Put the stem of

or other white flower 
into diluted scarlet 
ink for a short time.

parallel-veined. 

6. A transparency of dried flowers may be made as fol- 
lows : Take two panes of glass of equal size — one of them 

■ground, the other clear. By the use of gum tragicanth 
attach to the under side of the ground glass about half an 
inch of the edge of a dark ribbon, which should be over an

glass arrange the grasses, attaching them to it by touches 
of the gum. On the glass, just around its edges, fix a 
narrow strip of cardboard ; on this lay the clear glass, 
pressing the grasses flat. Bring up the unattached edge of 
the ribbon and fix it firmly by the mucilage over the upper 
glass, so imprisoning the grasses in the inclosure. 

One of the most beautiful decorations which may be main- 
tained within the home is found in the aquarium. The theory 
of the aquarium is that it shall so combine animal and vegeta- 
ble life in such exact proportions that the water shall be kept 
entirely pure, never needing change. In other words, the 
vegetable life shall take up the surplus carbon yielded by 
the animal life, and the animal life shall take up the surplus 
oxygen yielded by the vegetable life, and so things will re- 
main in statu quo. The theory is good, but it cannot be 
applied under circumstances sufficiently favorable to guar- 
antee success. 

In the great aquariums of museums it is found necessary 
to continually force fresh air through the water, that it may 
be maintained in a sufficiently oxygenized state ; and even 
then, such is the capacity of water for absorbing gases and 
odors from the atmosphere, that it must itself be renewed 
frequently. But the aquarium pays. Aside from the finish 
of the vessel itself, which 
is usually artistic, the plant 
life in water and the ac- 
tivity of the animal life, are 
unceasingly attractive. A 
common glass jar is bet- 
ter than nothing as an aqua- 
rium, though glass globes box aquarium. 
well adapted for small fish may be had at a low price. 
A better form of aquarium is shown in the accompanying 
cut. Such boxes may be had of all sizes and with great 
variety of finish. 




476 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

But a box is not essential as a beginning for an aquarium. 
The fact is, that any one having a little ingenuity, and the 
assistance of a handy tinsmith, can fit up a handsome and 
attractive affair. A frame-work may be made of tin to hold 
the glass, and to this frame a zinc bottom should be soldered. 
A bottom of wood underneath all should be finished nicely 
with a deep molding. After the glass has been set and 
well cemented in, the frame may be painted black, or green, 
or gilded, as taste may decide. The tank should be filled 
with fresh water every day until it is thoroughly cleansed, 
before fitting it for occupancy. Then the glass must be 
polished, the bottom covered with clean pebbles, stones, 
and small shells. A rockery, of rich brown and pure white 
stones should be constructed for the centre, surmounted by 
a large shell or two filled with earth, and Lycopodium 
growing therein. Cover this earth with pebbles and press 
them down firmly about the plant. After all this is ar- 
ranged, put the water in with a dipper, pouring against thf 
glass to avoid a disarrangement of the furniture. 

Every morning dip out two or three dippers of water, 
wipe the glass, and fill with fresh water. Use care hot to 
disturb the water more than is necessary. There is no 
reason why gold fish will not do well in an aquarium if 
managed -in this way. During very warm weather a lump 
of ice occasionally is appreciated by the littie golden 
beauties, for they can stand the cold much better than the 
heat. The fact is, that fish, supplied with clear water and a 
cool temperature, have scarcely any other want. The- 
omission of all attention to feeding, except in the spring 
months, is as great a kindness as can be shown them. In 
moderate latitudes, from the last of February to the first of 
July, the least crumb of cracker or fish-wafer suffices, and 
during the rest of the year experienced fish-fanciers say very 
little need be given ; that little, may be a few bread-crumbs 
or a pinch of plain cake.

While arranging aquariums attention may be paid to 
parlor rockeries, a less common but no less beautiful home 
decoration. A small parlor rockery can be made most 
satisfactorily by combining the aquarium and rockery, some- 
what as is shown in the accompanying engraving. In a 




PARLOR ROCKERY. 

living-room or parlor a good deal of sprinkling of the rocks 
must be done, or plants placed in the crevices will dry up. 
This necessitates a basin to catch and retain the drippings. 
It may be of sufficient depth for gold and other fish. It 
can be made of any form desired, and with any ornamenta- 
tion that taste may suggest. 

Or it may be shallow, and T)e bedded with mosses, ferns, 
and marsh plants, so making a bog-garden. A small faucet 
should be inserted at an inconspicuous point, by which to 
draw off" any excess of moisture. Excursions to the 
marshes will furnish an abundance of soil and plants for the 
basin, while a liberal assortment of plants will suit the con- 
ditions of the higher portions. Central to the rockery, a 
pot of roses, lilies, or other plants may be placed, its upper 
rim being concealed by the surrounding rocks. Variety 
and beauty can seldom be secured in one object so freely 
as is a well-kept parlor rockery: 

Ferneries are a well-known parlor decoration. A great 
variety of styles and sizes of bases and vases can be had.

They arc made of pottery, of rustic work, of tiled work, of 
iron, and of cabinet ware, and home ingenuity can meet all 
the requirements, even to the inclosing case of glass. The 
fernery shown in the cut we give is in imitation of oak, in 
rustic style, with rustic base. These bases are of different 
sizes, from eight to twelve inches , in diameter, the whole 

height, with glass, being from 
twelve to eighteen inches. Al- 
though these are small, still 
they serve a good purpose and 
are easily handled and managed. 
A more elaborate style of 
fernery may be made with a 
table-like base on four legs and 
casters. The case proper should 
be say sixteen inches in width 
by two and a half feet in length, 
and twenty-six inches high 
above the legs. This can be 
made by any joiner, and can be 
varied to correspond to any style of furniture. The top 
should be made to open for access to the interior, and also 
for ventilation. Within the wooden table-frame is fitted a 
zinc pan about 'three inches deep, which contains the soil ; 
this pan has an opening for drainage, and a shallow vessel 
should be placed in a concealed position underneath to 
receive any surplus water. 

Ferneries require a large amount of moisture. The vase, - 
or case covering, retains this and the warmth, so making 
perennial spring time for the plants within. All the swamp 
plants are suitable for fernery culture, but ferns do not like 
stagnant water. They flourish in low, moist places — but it 
is where the Vater is renewed by direct flow, or by subsoil 
drainage, which fact must not be overlooked in the fernery. 
Besides ferns, many kinds of mosses and selaginellas

succeed well in 
cases ; also some 
species of grasses, 
caladiums, be- 
gonias of the 
tuberous and the 
rex varieties, the 
sundews or dro- 
seras, some of the 
aroids, ficus re- 
pens, and others. 
An interesting 
variety of plants 
may, therefore, be 
secured, but ferns 
must be the prin- 
cipal feature. 

The fern-case, 
' after it is planted, 
should be placed 
where it can re- 
ceive a good light 
without being too 
much exposed to 
direct sunshine. 
Only sufficient 
Tyater should be 
given to keep the 
soil moist and not 
saturated. Some 
-ventilation is re- 
quired, but it need 
be slight, and yeti 
it should be care-| 
fully attended toj

each day, opening the doors of the case just enough to 
clear the glass of moisture. A little experience will enable 
one to care properly for a case. 

Ferneries are frequently adorned with ornaments carved 
in cork. A magnificent work of this kind was lately con- 
structed in London on an order from the King of Siam. 
The entire fernery consisted of five frames, each about ten 
feet in height and width, most artistically constructed, being 
covered with cork colored to resemble a true rockery. 
There is a pool at the base for water lilies and other 
aquatics, with numerous recesses, in which ferns will be 
placed. Several jets of water are arranged so that the 
whole surface will be constantly moist v/ith water dripping 
from the stalactitic projections at the upper part. Spaces at 
the back are filled with mirrors, and as these artificial " rock- 
eries " will occupy an alcove and be disposed in one line, the 
effect will be magnificent, and probably, in its kind, unrivalled. 

A careful observer of nature will soon discover how 
nature fixes herself in her prettiest forms. Observe where 
ferns grow and how they are surrounded. The. grasses, the 
mosses, the pebbles — all the accompaniments of fern-growth 
in nature — may be' transferred by art into the fernery. But 
art will surpass nature by eliminating all that is unsightly 
and retaining only the beautiful. 

The best cement to prevent leakage in aquariums, fern- 
eries, etc., is made as follows : Take equal parts of red lead, 
white lead, and litharge; dry, mix thoroughly, pulverizing all 
lumps. Then make into a putty by adding boiled linseed 
oil. Add a little at a time, and only a drop or two when 
nearly done, or you will get it too soft. As soon as the 
cement has been applied, fill the aquarium with water. 

It is possible to make very happy combinations from the 
natural world in internal home decoration. The illustra- 
tions already given have shown this. They combine flowers, 
vines, ferns, mosses, fishes, birds, rustic work, rocks, and other

natural featu-res of beauty. In the cut which follows a style 
of aquarium is shown which contains many points of 
beauty. The aquarium itself shows various forms of animal 
and vegetable life. The trellis allows a fine opportunity in 
the selection and training of plants, while the bird-cage at

the summit provides additional life, with song added to 

beauty and fragrance. 

Taste, patience, and a little expense are all that are needed 

to produce a beautiful display on this general plan. Taste and 

skill find splendid opportunity in the case of diminutive 

plants and fishes.

'■'■■ Fe\v adornments for the' interior of home afford so much 
bppbrtunity for varied, graceful, and really elegant display 
as 'd'6 hanging-baskets. Drapery is always beautiful, because 
feo perfectly natural ; but when flowers are pendant, mingled 
with delicate vines and mosses, then nature is seen in her 
most lovely forms. Such views of nature are furnished in 
hanging-baskets. The materials of which they are composed, 
the forms in which they are wrought, and the flowers 
with which they may be filled, are without limit. Terra- 
cotta ware, wire, and rustic work are chiefly employed, but 
natural objects, such as shells, gourds, 
etc., form the basis of many attractive 
displays of this character. A neat 
hanging-basket is exceeding graceful 
also, and it is, in place everywhere, a 
welcome " thing of beauty." 

Plants in vases and hanging-baskets 
are peculiarly situated in respect to 
the moisture in the soil. This is sub- 
ject to rapid evaporation. Not only is 
there the ordinary drainage, such as 
plants in pots have and which is abso- 
lutely necessary, since stagnant water at 
.the roots would be fatal, but these plant 
receptacles are usually situated where they are fully exposed 
to. the sun and to drying winds. The great demand of 
basket and vase plants is'water^ and attention to this supply 
is almost the only care necessary. 

In a room it is almost impossible to moisten plants fully 
and properly. It is best, therefore! that baskets be taken to 
some outer room every day or two for a good soaking, 
where they may remain until dripping ceases. Where 
6: wire basket is used, or an opening is provided for drainage, 
dripping continues for some time. An arrangerhent is 
shown in the next engraving for catching this drip; ■ It ia

merely a second basket or earthen vessel suspended undei 
the main one, and planted so as to 
be both useful and ornamental. 

As the number of plants in bask- 
ets and vases is usually large for 
the quantity of soil they contain, 
it should be rich. What is wanted 
is a rapid, luxuriant growth, with- 
out much regard to the form of in- 
dividual plants. A good soil for 
the purpose may be made of about 
one part of old manure, two parts 
of rotten sods, and one part of sand. 
If leaf-mold can be had, an amount 
of it can be added equal to the sand or manure, if not, the 

mixture without it will 
be quite satisfactory. 
When the plants have 
been placed in their 
new quarters and wa- 
tered, it is necessary 
to keep them shaded 
for a short time, and 
if possible they should . 
have the advantage of 
a greenhouse or cold- 
frame until they make 
new roots and com- 
mence to grow freely. 
Concerning plants 
suitable for hanging- 
baskets, James Vick, 
of Rochester, New 
ELEGANT HANGING-BASKET. ^ork, an authority on 

the subject, makes the following valuable suggestions : 




486 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

Erect Plants. — Amaranthus salicifolius, Amaranthus Sun^ 
rise, Caladium, Canna, Coleus, Cyperus alternifolius, Dra. 
casna. Fuchsia. 

Trailing /Yaw/j.— German Ivy, Kenilworth Ivy, Ivy-leaved 
Geranium, annual varieties of Lobelia, Nolana, Othonna 
crassifolia, Petunia, Tradescantia, Saxifraga sarmentosa, 
Vinca major variegata, Vinca Harrisonii. 

Twining Plants. — Ipomoea Quamoclit, Madeira Vine, 
Maurandya, Pilogyne suavis, Thunbergia, Tropaeolum maius, 
Tropaeolum Lobbianum. 

Handsoifie Foliage Plants. — Abutilon Mesopotamicum 
variegatum, Acalypha Macafeeana, Achyranthes, Alternan- 
thera, Anthericum vittatum variegatum. Ornamental-leaved 
Begonia, Centaurea gymnocarpa, Centaurea Candida, Cin- 
eraria maritima, Coleus, Euonymus Japonicus aureus, 
Euonymus argenteus, Euonymus radicans variegata, Far- 
fugium grande. Variegated-leaved Geranium, Fragrant 
Geranium, Glaucium corniculatum. 

Plowering Plants. — Ageratum Mexicanum and var., Alys- 
sum Colossus, Double White Alyssum, Alyssum variega- 
tum, Alyssum The Gem, Begonia, Cuphea, Fenzlia, Fuchsia, 
Geranium, Heliotrope, Lantana, Mahernia odorata, Mahernia 
Hector, Mjmulus, Nierembergia, Oxalis floribunda alba, 
Oxalis floribunda rosea. Petunia, Rivinia, Schizanthus. 

A good home-made hanging-basket may be constructed 
thus : Take coarse, heavy wire for foundation and handle 
and interlace it With old hoop wire, made pliable by heating. 
Then take young portulacca plants with a lump of earth 
attached to each ; put the plants outward through the open 
spaces of the basket until it is full. The plants take kindly 
to their unnatural position and soon become a mass of 
beautiful green and brilliant flowers. In each basket place 
an empty tin box, inserted in a cavity in the top portion of 
the earth. Fill this with water daily, and in it place fresh 
flowers, as fancy dictates. The effect is delightful.

Another is shown in the next cut. It is made of a gourd, 
the top rim being cut into scollops and the bottom end cut 
off to allow drainage. It should be filled with a light, rich 
soil, and if planted with Dichorsandra for its centre and 
Othouna for the droop, its effect will be most beautiful. 

Hanging vases of silvered 
double glass can be had. A 
false bottom is added to pro- 
mote drainage, and by means 
of a tube the gathered water 
can be drawn off The effect 
of foliage is greatly improved 
by the reflecting surfaces of 
such a vase. 

Birds are charming pets in a 
home. Their sweet songs add 
exquisite pleasure to other 
natural beauties. A talking 
parrot is hardly to be reckoned 
as a gem ; but a singing canary 
is a prize. The trouble of keep- ^^ourd hanging-basket. 
ing them is sometimes complained of but bird-fanciers 
sum up the whole matter thus : 

Keep the cage clean. 

Place the cage so that no <}raft of air can strike the bird, 
and not too near windows in cold weather. 

Give nothing to healthy birds but seed, water, cuttle-fish 
bone, and gravel on the floor of cage. An occasional lump 
of pure white sugar may be added. 

Occasionally a little water for bathing. 

The room should not be overheated. 

When moulting (shedding feathers) keep warm and avoid 
drafts of air. 

Give plenty of rape seed. 

A little hird-boiled egg grated fine is excellent.

LADIES' HANDIWORK. 

Beyond all the professional decorator can do, and all that 
can be done with natural objects, there is a realm of decora- 
tive possibility where the wives and daughters of our homes 
reign supreme. Their skillful fingers and exquisite taste 
work wonders of ornamentation. The internal fittings and 
furnishings of a house are but the framework on which' 
those who love and brighten home display their choice 
embellishments. 

To specify all the beautiful things which tasty ladies- 
can make with unpromising material is not possible ; much 
less can these attractions be described. But the subject 
may be illustrated, and hints concerning it may be given. 

Mantel decorations are very popular and elegant. They 
are attached to a board placed on the mantel slab. This is 
covered with the chosen material, which also depends from 
the edge — plain, plaited, scalloped, or draped. An elegant 
decoration of this kind, recently exhibited in the Decorative 
Art Rooms, of New York, was made of deep, wine-colored 
plush cut in a shallow scallop, the centre being about 
eighteen inches deep, and caught up carelessly with ahand-^ 
some cord and pompon tassels one-quarter yard from each 
end, so that a very' graceful, draped effect was given. Its 
centre was decorated with a branch design of wild roses, so 
arranged that its uppermost part will lay over on the man- 
tel. The blossoms — made of rose-colored velvet — were so 
folded as to be a perfect representation of real rose petals ; 
stamens and pistils were worked with gold thread ; leaves 
and branches in "arrasene. The bottom was finished with 
alternate tassels of pink and light and dark shades of olive. 

Another design was made of olive macrame twine cro- 
cheted in an open pattern and having two-inch wide cardinal 
satin ribbon interlaced in the jopenings. This twine comes 
in a variety of colors, and to make a lambrequin eighteen 
inches deep and fringe would require five bunches.

There are imported tapestry designs for valances and 
chair-backs which are sought after by those who wish to 
furnish in antique style. They come in quaint designs, 
usually rural scenes, worked in quarter single stitches, 
which resemble a woven 
texture in their fine- '4JW 

ness, and are to be filled 
in with whatever solid 
color may seem adapt- 
ed. Illustrations of this 
art will be found among 
the various cuts of "this 
volume. 

An ordinary kitchen 
table can be transformed 
into quite an elegant 
piece of furniture for 
the library. The top 
and legs are smoothly 
covered with green 
cloth ; the seam neatly 
sewed, and on the in- 
side, that it may not 
show. It is then tacked 
at the top to hold it in 
place. Cloth is then 
drawn smoothly over 
the top and tacked all round the sides. The piece extending 
round the sides of the table must also be covered. An under 
shelf made of pine wood covered with cloth is then fitted 
securely to the legs about eight inches below the top. A 
heavy cord fringe of green worsted must be fastened round 
the edge of the top, also round the shelf, with brass-head'cd' 
nails about an inch and a half apart. A caster fitted into 
each leg will finish this very handsome table. 




MINIATURE TABLE FOR FRUIT. 



492 



THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 



A miniature table, to be used as an ornamental fruit-stand, 
is shown in the preceding cut. It is made of bamboo, rustic 
branches, or turned legs, painted or gilded, as taste suggests. 
These are attached at their tops to a wide hoop, into which 
a deep dish fits iirmly. The legs are then tied securely at 
their point of crossing with a cord and tassel. The outer 
edge of the hoop is then ornamented with drapery of bright 
colored cloth or satin with bead work, ornamented with 
tassels. A painted plaque or handsome dish may be 
inserted in the table, and so serve as a card-receiver. 

A handsome 
table-cover 
may be made 
of sateen with 
a plush bor- 
dering. The 
centre should 
be of olive 
green, the 
border of a 
darker shade. 
On the four 
sides, just 
above the 
plush, the 
names of the 
four seasons 
maybe work- 
ed in fancy 
letters with 
crewels or 
silks, each 

word decorated with flowers or leaves appropriate to the 
season. Fancy stitches worked in different colored silks 
may ornament the seam where the plush and sateen join.

Great variety may be secured in standing work-baskets. 
Stands of great variety in wicker-work are .sold. Get one 
with two shelves, in each of which cut a hole large enough 
to receive an ordinary straw hat, crown downward. The 
braid around the edges of the shelves must be gilt, also the 
rings. The brim of the upper hat must have a full facing 
of blue satin. A bag of the same is fitted into the crown 
and drawn together with a satin ribbon at its top. A bunch 
of artificial roses and leaves is fastened on one side of the 
brim. The under hat has a full facing of satin, cut large 
enough to serve as a lining fof the crown. A large, gilt 
ring is fastened to the edge of the upper shelf between each 
pair of supports, and a broad band of satin ribbon, which 
may be hand-painted, is run through each ring, then crossed 
to the lower shelf, where it is fastened to the leg with a 
double bow and ends. The outside of the hats may be gilded 
if preferred. 

The adjoining cut 
shows another form of 
stand. This stand may 
be bought in rattan, or 
made of rustic boughs 
suitably curved. Two 
hoops are used in this 
stand, into which paint- 
ed or ornamental dishes 
fit securely, their edges 
being hung with crewel 
or with bead-work. To 
make the bead border- 
ing, take a narrow strip 
of oil-cloth and fit it 
tightly around the edges 
of the hoops and plates. vkitixg-card stand. 

Measure off equal distances and sew on black jet buttons. 




494 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



From these, string bronze beads for the first or upper row. 
Make the second row of gold beads and the third of white; 
Attach these to the jet buttons. Make a final row of 
variously colored beads, twisted together, and_ fastened to 

the jet buttons. After these 
are all in place and grace- 
fully festooned, cut away 
any of the oil-cloth which 
shows below the ornaments. 
Fancy baskets are capable 
of very beautiful adornment. 
Such baskets can be had 
in the stores in many de- 
cidedly attractive forms. 
The work upon those , 
shown in the illustrations 
is such as a practiced eye 
can readily trace. The 
blending of colors will af- 
ford fine opportunity for a 
display of taste. Even the 
scrap-basket may be so em- 
bellished that the container 
of refuse becomes a minis- 
ter of pleasure. The willow-ware furnished for this purpose 
is varied so greatly and so elegantly that a good base for 
operations is easily secured. The decorations can be 
attached readily also, which is a point of value. The result 
is so light in weight, and withal so beautiful and useful, that 
scrap-balsket decoration becomes specially inviting. 

A novelty in scrap-baskets may be made as follows : 
Select a medium^sized Japanese umbrella with a plain! 
ground and gilt figures. Glue the knob or point securely 
into a square or circular block of wood smoothly finished.' 
This block must be heavy enough to serve as a stand for 








LADY'S WORK-BASKET.

the umbrella and hold it steadily in its upright position. 

The block is to be painted the color of the umbrella and 

decorated with gilt 

figures. To prevent 

the umbrella from fall- 
ing open, the points of 

the ribs must be inter- 
laced with satin ribbon. 

Several shades of the 

narrowest ribbons 

may be turned in and 

out of the ribs like 

basket-work, or a wide 

ribbon may be used. 

The umbrella should be 

not quite half open. A 

piece of gilt paper must 

be cut to fit the inside 

of the umbrella and 

prevent papers and scraps from falling through to the point, 

from whence • it 
would be difficult 
to remove them. 
If narrow ribbons 
are used for the 
lacings, tie a 
bunch of them- 
round the handle 
with long loops 
and ends, and 
their many colors 
make a gay trim- 
ming. With the 
wider ribbon use

A Japanese umbrella may be utilized as a fire-screen by 

adorning it with peacock's feathers. Cut off the stems of 

the feathers to within a few inches of the eyes ; then stitch 

the eyes on in rows around 
the umbrella, beginning at 
the outer edge, and have 
each row to overlap the 
other till the centre is 
reached ; then finish the 
centre off with a tuft of 
small feathers. The um- 
brella should never be 
closed, as the shutting, 
would be disastrous to the 
feathers. When completed, 
the handle of the umbrella 
may be set into an upright 
CORNER SCRAP-BASKET. g^aft, which is Supported 

in a base of heavy wood. The umbrella-handle should not 

exceed six inches in length, 

the support about two feet 

high. The base and support 

should be brightly colored. 
A beautifully embroidered 

fire-screen is shown in the 

adjoining cut. Frames for 

these can be purchased in 

many styles ; the taste and 

skill of home fill out the 

centre. The materials for 

this centre are varied and 

elegant, and if well handled, 

the result must be delightful. 

The screens are valuable to embroidered fire-screen.

Pincushions have ever 
been a delightsome field 
for artistic effort. In shape, 
material, filling, etc., they 
vary indefinitely. 

Crewel work, bead work, 
patch work, ribbon work, 
lace work, and all other 
kinds of work, are brought 
to bear on pincushions, and 
many are the conquests 
which have been made in 
this line. Every home has 
something in the way of 
bureau-covers, toilet sets, 
tidies, sofa-cushions, pillow- 
shams, pen-wipers, shaving 
cases, whisp-holders, etc., ornamental wall-cushion. 
etc. In many instances these are but rude attempts, and 
yet they are not to be despised. Rude attempts always 
precede success, and sometimes inaugurate it. Welcome, 
tiien, every honest attempt at art.

On the bottom 
four casters were

back to the wall. Upon the table was a pretty toilet set in

were ornamented with simple Swiss curtains caught back 
with blue bows. 

A few special features of upholstery, which any lady of 
taste can apply in her own home, may yet be touched. The 
opposite cut of an upholstered bedstead is suggestive. A 
common bedstead, or one showing hard usage, may be 
covered on this plan so as to become an object of beauty. 
_— ^ A plain 

canc-scated 
sofa, or an 
antiquated 
wooden 
settee, may 
be similarly 
decorated, 
and be far 
more com- 
fortable and 
elegant for 

the work. To illustrate this method of procedure, the 
Shearaton sofa is shown above. Its make is more elaborate, 
but its covering is on the same general plan as is suggested 
for the plainer furniture. 

In doing any of this upholstered and cushioned work, the 
best way is to make and fit all the parts with cushions made 
of ticking or other substantial material. When the fit is 
assured, cover with cretonne, leather, or other goods, and 
finish as desired. On the top an ornamental tuft or suitable 
button should show, the cord being drawn tightly and tied 
on the under side. The cushions should be firmly attached 
to the settee.

Embroidery and painting are very popular and elegant 
employments for ladies. Both these arts may rise very 
high. The famous Bayeux tapestry contains 1,512 figures, 
of which sixty-five are dogs, 202 horses, 505 other quadru- 
peds, birds, or sphinxes ; 623 are men, twenty-seven build- 
ings, forty-one boats, and forty-nine trees. It is divided 
into fifty-eight parts, each representing a scene in the career 
of William the Conqueror, and each having an inscription 
in Latin. This tapestry is of linen, two hundred feet long

by twenty inches wide. Worsteds in seven colors are used 
in it. It is preserved in the town hall of Bayeux, France, 
and is regarded as the work of Queen Matilda, in the twelfth 
century. 

From this pinnacle of art there are gradations, almost 
imperceptible, downward to the simplest work of school- 
girls and little children. Knitting and crochet work also 
are varied beyond the power of adequate 
description, and so are many other forms 
of useful and ornamental needlework. 

Decorative painting has a scope equally iQMt ^ ^i i m

exercises itself upon woods, china, glass,

Among the less expensive and yet very beautiful ma- 
terials which invite home effort in the art of coloring 
are certain forms of pottery, prepared expressly for this 
purpose. The Albertine 
ware, for instance, pro- 
duced at the ancient 
pottery at North Cam- 
bridge, Mass., is made 
of a very fine clay, which, 
when burnt, is of a rich 
dark red or genuine

and artistic styles

reproduced with exact conformity in shape and size. High 
rehef is a characteristic of this ware. Flowers, leaves, stems, 
and other forms stand boldly out and' 
afford a most inviting field for the artistic 
hand. The accompanying illustrations 
show the general appearance of these 
goods, which vary in sizes from eight to 
eighteen inches in diameter, or in height. 
On this matter of painting and orna- 
mentation a word of warning may be 
raised. Things are ornamented which 
are better plain. Every article of mer- 
chandise has its ornament stamped or 
attached in some way. Clothing, bed- 
linen, table-linen, tinware, woodenware, silverware — all 
sorts of ware — are covered with monograms, coats-of-arms, 
meaningless emblems, and intri- 
cate convolutions, the fundamen- 
tal idea of which neither owner 
nor maker can tell. Better leave 
some articles for unadorned 
utility. 

And some proper subjects for 
decoration are improperly deco- 
rated. Imagine the " Author

good taste, but the little girl of the household shrinks with 

horror from a certain garden-worm whenever her food hap- 
pens to accompany that decoration. 
' The law is this : Decorate none but 

proper articles, and decorate them 

properly. 

• Clarence Cook, writing on over- 
decoration, delivers himself in the 

following forceful words : " The 

architects cannot design a house or 

a church, but they must carve every 

stone ; cover the walls with cold, 

discordant tiles ; break up every 

straight line with cuts and chamfers ; 

plow every edge into moldings ; crest 

every roof-ridge and dormer-window 

with painted and gilded iron, and 

. refuse to give us a square foot of wall 

on which to rest the tired eye. Within, the furniture 
follows in the same rampant law- 
lessness. The beauty of simplicity 
in form ; the pleasure to be had from 
lines well thought out ; the agreeable- 
ness of unbroken surfaces where there 
is no gain in breaking them ; harmony 
in color, and, on the whole, the minis- 
tering to the satisfaction we all have 
in not seeing the whole of everything 
at once, — these considerations the 
makers of our furniture, ' fashion- 
r_^ able ' and ' Canal Street ' alike, have 
utterly ignored, and the strife has 
long been : Who shall make the 

loudest chairs and sofas and give us the most glare and 

glitter for our money ?" 




PYRAMIDAL VASE. 



III.— EXTERIOR DECORATIONS. 

ARTISTIC architecture is doing wonders in the ex- 
ternal decoration of homes. Even where long rows 
of city houses stand in serried ranks, the present ten- 
dency is to break up monotony, to secure beautiful variety. 
This is done by introducing diversity of forms and colors. 
Bay-windows, mansard-roofs, Swiss projections, permanent 
'vindow-gardens, variously colored bricks, slates, tiles, 
stones, etc., and the splendid decorations in terra cotta, 
make fine variety possible. Where stone is used ornamen- 
tation is limited only by the genius of the architect and the 
purse of the owner. 

In cathedrals and grand public buildings, statuary plays 
an important part in decoration, but for private use this is 
unsuitable, except the house be very large and ornate. In 
private grounds, statuary and vases are allowable if in har- 
mony with their surroundings. Mercury should not be the 
conspicuous piece in a camp-meeting ground, nor should St. 
Peter or St. Paul be the chief feature in a commercial ex- 
change. 

The choice materials for statuaty are marble and bronze. 
For outside positions, the stress of weather is damaging, 
however, and the general effect is none the less happy if 
baser materials be employed. Such ornaments are a spe- 
cialty with various artistic workers in metal, whose elegant 
reproductions of the best works of statuary and vases are 
prepared in iron and zinc, and of all desirable sizes. A few 
ornanients of this character will greatly improve any 
grounds. Their location should be artistic, and with an 
eye for the effect. It is not the vase alone that should be 
displayed, but its display should beautify the surroundings.

In rural homes, or those where

Egyptian vases for garden uses are beautiful, but the 
strong coloring of the ancients must be shunned, especially 
in the upper part, where they mingle with the flowers. In 
the accompanying cut of an Egyptian vase the base (b) is 
constructed of wood, and is painted' 
bright blue, red, and yellow, or merely 
tinted a light or porcelain blue and red 
toned to a brownish cast. The flower- 
pot, or upper part (a), is to be made 
of red clay or terra cotta, the orna- 
ments in relief to be colored a green- 
ish blue, eau de Nile. The pot with 
its contents should be removed to the 
greenhouse when the cold weather 
comes on, the pedestal remaining as a 
permanent winter decoration. 

Home-made vases may be con- 
structed of cast-off boxes of small 
size, half-kegs, etc. These are readily 
covered with rustic strips, made of bark 
or of pieces of sapling cut in half 
longitudinally. Holes must be bored 
in the bottoms, and the whole be 
mounted on an upright post two or three feet in height.

It has become customary in the most beautiful rural cities 
and villages to discard fences. A stone curbing marks the 
street line, while the dividing line of neighbors is not visi- 
ble, but the open lawn, kept by mutual arrangement, runs 
J / I on unbroken. Hedges 

may be employed as 
necessary fencing, or to 
conceal unsightly ob- 
jects which cannot be 
rerhoved. A good hedge 
requires a good soil, so 
that its growth may be 
FORM OF PRUNING A HEDGE. yigorous. The plants, 

when set out, should be of equal size and set in a single line. 
The Japan quince can be planted six inches apart, and the 
honey locust and Osage orange at nine inches. 

Different styles of planting have been practiced, such as 
setting the plants in double or triple rows, setting them 
very closely, as within three or four inches of each other, 
and also at distances as great as eighteen inches or two feet. 
Experience has shown 
that the plants when 
close to each other 
grow thin and feebly ; 
that with sufficient care 
a better hedge can be 
made with wide than 

with narrow planting. 

In the spring of the " ^o^m of full-grown hedge. 

second year the soil about the hedge must be well worked. 
The main shoot must be cut back to within one joint of its 
Starting point, the side shoots remaining a little longer. 
In the third spring, trim in a pyramidal form, as in the 
first cut. This secures light and air at the centre of the 
plant. A later cutting may bring the branches back almost

to the first outline. Four or five years will secure a hedge 

five feet high and six feet thick, through which neither man 

nor beast can pass. Its form may be trimmed at last into 

that shown in the second cut. 

Rustic seats always adorn grounds of reasonable extent. 

Single chairs or extended benches may 

be made, and stumps or other unsightly 

objects may be pressed into the service of 

beauty and utility. Over rustic seats 

vines should clamber, or trees should cast 

their shade. No one wishes to sit in the 

glare of the sun. A Virginia creeper 

will speedily form a dense covering for 

such a place. A little care will train 

it as an arch, an umbrella, an awning, a 

tent, or almost any desired object.. 

For outdoor flower-holders many de- rustic chair. 

vices have been worked out. There are terra-cotta pots 

fashioned to resemble stumps and rustic boxes. Rightly 

placed, these heighten the ar- 
tistic effect of a garden. For 
all plants in vases, or similar- 
vessels, special attention is 
needed or they will dry out. 
If sufficient water is given 
there is no danger from the 
heat of the sun — perhaps it is 
an advantage. Instead of 
watering with a pitcher, give 
a pailful at a time, gently and 
slowly showered upon the 
plants. After the trailing 

plants in a vase fall over the sides, they afford a shade ; but 
if anything like proper care is used, plants will thrive as. 
well in vases ds in any other location.

For the margin, in shallow water, there is a numerous 
class of plants, such as the different species of rush, the cat-

pitchers. 

- Here, too, we may have the mosses, which Ruskin thus

One of the prettiest freaks of nature is that which buries 
a house in vines. For the most satisfactory results the vines 
must be favorably rooted in the earth. Balcony gardening 
and exterior window gardening may go on beautifully by 
means of pots and boxes, but such work is, necessarily, ol 
limited extent. One of the most striking instances of vine 
decoration is shown in the engraving here given. It is an 
actual drawing from 
a French home. A 
vine-loving visitor 
thus described it in 
one of our floral 
monthlies : " From 
the flag sidewalk 
grew a large grape- 
vine, with a stem pos- 
sibly five inches in 
thickness, without a 
branch or leaf until it 
reached the second 
story. It was then 
trained over the bal- 
cony, making a most 
beautiful arbor, and 
ascendied still higher. 
Being the latter part 
of the summer, the 
vine was well loaded 
with white grapes. ,^. .,„^

somewhat after the manner in which English gardeners 
sometimes grow cucumbers. I have never seen another 
balcony that seemed to me so charming." 

The Canary Flower is a beautiful 
vine, but little used, and yet well 
adapted to our climate. Its leaves are 
a beautiful, light green, and its flow- 
ers of a bright lemon yellow color.

make a splendid appearance when in

circle some four feet in diameter, fastening them together at 
the top like an Indian tent, while with these Morning Glo- 
ries may be blended, so producing a rapid shade, which is 
very beautiful to behold. Shady places are more favorable 
to Nasturtiums than those more exposed, but loosening the 
soil and watering freely will work wonders for them even 
in the dryest times.

CALADIUM PLANTS. 

And now, while on the shady places, it may as well be 
said that it is by no means easy to obtain flowers without 
some sunshine. Two hours of sunshine a day will, how- 
ever, give life enough to many plants to insure flowers. In 
shady places we can have ferns, of course, and Caladiums, 
Cannas, and other foliage plants, but it is not best to trV 
flowers. 

Where there are two hours of sunshine we can have Fuch- 



THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 523 

ias, Pansies, Lily of the Valley, Perennial Phloxes, For- 
get-me-nots, and many other things that succeed better in 
partial shade than in the full sunshine. For such places 
the Japan and California Lilies are pre-eminently valuable. 

The Caladium has become a great favorite in this country, 
as it well deserves to be, because its leaves are so large and 
handsome, and also because it never disappoints. It is very 
rare for a bulb to fail to grow and give satisfaction. The 
preceding engraving is from a photograph of a plant of one 
season only. Leaves of the Caladium have grown to be by 
actual measurement three feet and seven inches in length, 
thirty inches in width, and ten feet three inches in circum- 
ference. Another leaf has been reported which reached the 
enormous length of forty-one inches, and was twenty-eight 
inches wide. While so gigantic, they are also beautiful in 
texture, and strikingly so from their splendid size. 

Other splendid leaf plants are numerous and inexpensive. 
The Ricinus, or castor-oil plant, is a king in its way. Rich 
and luxuriant in appearance and quick to grow, it is justly 
a great favorite. The Maranta, or Calathea, is a splendidly 
striped leaf plant. The leaves grow from one to two feet in 
length, are purple underneath, and beautifully ribbed with 
velvet on top. This is also a splendid in-door plant. 

Everybody knows the value of roses and other flowering 
plants. The superb catalogues of the leading florists of the 
country furnish all needed information concerning them, so 
that the only duty here is to point out these ample sources 
of information and supply, and commend the public to try 
the best of them. 

A glimpse at French gardening is given in the following 
view of the garden of Fontainebleau, the pride of the Parisian 
heart. The very trees are trimmed into perfect order. In-, 
deed, this garden is excessive in its regularity. There are , 
too many right lines. Landscape gardening, with its unend- 
ing variety, commands more general favor in this country.

Clearly, in this case, the master mind was of a strictly 
mathematical turn. There are flower-beds, plenty of them, 
laid out on the square ; plenty of shrubbery, every alternate

distance apart, the whole ground evidently having been laid 
out with compass and square to a mathematical point. 

A few gardens of this character are pleasing ; or a portion 
of any garden so laid out secures variety, but such regular- 
ity must be occasional only. The distinctly marked figures 
in the heavens are very few, and we of the earth may take a 
lesson therefrom. But some right lines and sharply marked 
figures are admissible. 

The ribbon beds, now so popular for parks, lawns, and 
gardens, are beautiful illustrations of regularity. This system

of bedding, it is claimed, is artificial, and not in good taste, 
which possibly is true ; but tastes differ and change con- 
stantly. It is now thought in good taste to imitate and 

admire the productions of 
Japanese art by those who, 
few years ago, ridiculed, 
poor, benighted Japs. So 
taste changes in flower beds. 
Ribbon beds may be of flowering or 
variegated leaf-plants, or of both in com- 
bination. The principal consideration in mak- 
ing such beds is to procure plants of nearly 
uniform height, and flowering, that will keep in 
bloom during the whole season, for a failure in 
either respect will mar, if not ruin, the bed. The 
plants must be set so close together, that when they 
have attained their growth, the whole bed will be 
RIBBON covered without a break. The tops must be pinched 
^^°' off judiciously so that there will be no excessive' 
growth, but that they all will show evenly. 

One of the finest displays of variegated flower beds can 

be made with the bul- 
bous plants of the early, 
spring. Crocuses, Hy- 
acinths, and Tulips 
may all adorn the gar- 
dens, and if carefully 
selected and arranged 
splendid effects will be 
secured as the reward of the gardener 's taste and skill. 

There is really no limit to the styles which may be intro- 
duced in these beds, both in their component parts and in 
their forms. From the diminutive growth of the lowest- 
growing plants to the most stately of them, all find a place 
and a use in ribbon beds.

Dwarf trees are a specialty with the Chinese. Pines and 
oaks a half century old arc seen in their flower-pots. The 
secret of the dwarfing is in weakening the seat of vigor all 
that is possible without destroying life. Take, for example, 
a young cedar two or three inches high and cut off its tap 
root, resetting that on a stone in a shallow pan with a clay

soil. Water and light enough to keep the plant alive are 
allowed, but no more. The shape is controlled by pegs and 
strings, and is often very odd. The' Japanese carry this 
dwarfing to such a ridiculous degree that a Dutch merchant 
was shown a box three inches deep and with a square inch 
of. surface, in which a bamboo, a fir, and a plum tree — the 
latter in full bloom — were growing and thriving. The price 
asked for this botanical curiosity was three hundred dollars.

Tastefully made rockeries are good adornments. They 
need not be built into arches and beacons, as is done some- 
times with questionable taste, but they should be sufficiently 
large to deserve their title. The rocks must be so sepa- 
rated as to allow deep pockets of rich earth to be con- 
structed. Many charm- 
ing native plants will 
flourish in such places, 
but will not succeed in 
more open and ex- 
j posed beds. The trail-

Polite Deportment. 



How sweet and gracious, even in common speech. 
Is that fine sense which men call courtesy ! 
Wholesome as air and genial as the light — 
Welcome in every clime as breath of flowers; 
Jt transmutes aliens into trusting friends 
And ^ives its owner passport round the globe. 

James T. Fiu>. 



Polite Deportment. 



SOME one has said that " a man's manners arc his for- 
■ tune," meaning that the way to position and easy- 
competence in life is often found through gentleness and 
good breeding, which lead first to genuine respect, then to 
esteem and confidence. Many a young man has failed to 
secure a coveted place by reason of his boorish ways or 
awkward movements at a first interview, and foolishly charged 
his loss to " ill luck," when the fault was wholly with him- 
self Many another has moved right up to a well-deserved 
eminence in his calling more by his genteel and polite bear- 
ing than by reason of some superior mental capacity. 

WHERE TO LOOK FOR MODELS. 

True gentlemen and ladies may be found in the humblest 
walks of life, among both young and old. The marks that 
prove them such are not wholly external, though the inter- 
nal conditions are evidenced by the external. There is a 
sham politeness which bows and smirks and is obeisant in 
public, but is detestably wanting in common civility' in pri- 
vate. Such as indulge in this kind wear their manners as 
one wears an outer garment, which is put on when leaving 
home and left on the hall rack at the door when returning 
home. Some of these are the over-nice people, who pre- 
.tend to hide their faces and try to affbct blushes at the mere 
mention of some very natural and proper subjects. Others 
are known as the Exquisite, the Dandy, the Fop, the Dude, 
whose brains are generally less than their surface manners.

§32 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

It is evident that us the principles of a language are 
derived from the usage of the best writers and speakers, so 
the principles of polite deportment are derived from the 
usage of the truest and best people. The rules in the one 
case are not more definite than in those of the other. The 
highest point of culture to which anyone may attain in 
either is.purely a matter ofchoice. Tha beginning must be 
in one's-self,, but with ^n assurance that the largest success 
is not only practicable, biit a, duty to self and to society. 



THE REAL GENTLEMAN AND LADY. 

A recent writer thus well -describes the true geintleman 
and lady : " To formulate the definition in negatives would 
be. easy. As, for instance^ we may say that a true gentle- 
man does not soil his conscience with falsehood, does; not 
waste his time upon sensual indulgence, does not endeavor- 
to make the worse appear the better reason^ tloes not ridi7 
cule sacred subjects, does not willfullygive cause of offense 
to any, does not seek to overreach his neighbor, does not 
forget the respect due to womanhood or to old age, the feeble 
or the poor. And so, too, the true lady does not conde- 
scend to scandal or gossip, does not profane her lips With 
' slang ' words, does not yield to outbursts of temper, does 
not sacrifice modesty to fashion, does not turn a deaf ear to 
theyoice of distress. But, to speak affirmatively : A gentle- 
man is one whose aims are generous, whose trust is 
constant, whose word is never broken, whose honor is never 
stained, who is as brave as gende and as honest as wise, 
who wrongs no one by word or deed, and devotes and em- 
bellishes life by nobility of thought, depth of feeling; and 
grace of manner. As for the true lady— she will be,-of, 
necessity, the counterpart of the true gentleman : Pure, 
refined, generous, sweet of temper, gentle of speech, truthful; 
to her heart's core, shunning the very appearance of, evil, 
and instant in well-doing." 



POLITE DEPORTMEXr. 533 

PERSONAL HABITS. 

We are now ready to consider personal habits in their 
relation to polite deportment. Every person owes certain 
well-defined obligations to society, not only in the line of 
what is said and done in the presence of others, but in the 
appearance and habits, which in an important degree affect 
the comfort and pleasure of others. It has been well said 
that " cleanliness, neatness, and tidiness represent the triple 
incentive to the maintenance of any and every system of 
etiquette." An untidy person of either sex gives evidence 
either of ignorance or willful disregard of the commonest 
principles of politeness. 

Other things being equal, the person who enjoys good 
health will be the best-mannered, and no one has any right 
to live in disregard of those practices and conditions which 
produce or promote health. The daily bath, proper cleans- 
ing of the teeth and mouth, scrupulous care as to the 
finger-nails, and careful dressing of the hair — without oils, 
pomades, or perfumes — are essential duties. Over-eating, 
with its train of headaches, foul breath, and indigestion ; 
and the use of tobacco in any form, with disgusting expecto- 
ration, are not the practices which mark the best-bred per- 
sons. " If one must chew, let him be particular where he 
expectorates. He should not discharge tobacco-juice in 
public vehicles, on the sidewalk, nor in any place where it 
will be offensive. The English rule is for him to spit in his 
handkerchief; but this is not a pleasant alternative. On 
some occasions no other may offer." Whether smoking is 
good or bad, wholesome or injurious, the excess of 
smoking is, at all events, as noxious to the smoker as it is 
disagreeable to his neighbors. If you must have your pipe 
or your weed, retire to some apartment kept exclusively as 
a smoking-room. Do not smoke in a lady's presence ; not 
even if her good nature prompt her to yield assent. You 



534 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

have no right to impregnate her garments with pot-house 
odor. 

Toilet offices of all kinds should be in private. Cleansing 
the nose or the ears, or cleaning and trimming the finger 
nails in public, is an offense against decency, and never 
should be indulged in. Biting the nails, fingering the 
beard, drumming on the table with your fingers, crossing 
your legs and shaking your free foot, loud breathing, yawn- 
ing, snuffling, and going about with hands thrust in the 
pockets, are not marks of politeness and good breeding. A 
quiet and self-possessed manner and quiet movements of 
the person are always better than restless and disturbing 
habits, which are sure to be obtrusive as well as dis- 
agreeable. 

HABITS OF SPEECH. 

One's habits of speech will betray the inward character. 
Truly polite people do not use other than polite language, 
which is but a plain, simple, and unaffected expression of 
one's thoughts. Coarse and vulgar words, slang phrases, 
and profanity should never have place. Some people swear 
because of an idea that it is manly; some from habit, with- 
out thinking of what they say ; some are only profane when 
excited with anger ; some from choice, neither fearing God 
nor regarding man, and in defiance of the divine command, 
" Swear not at all." A lady was once annoyed by the fre- 
quent oaths of a young student sitting near her in a rail- 
road car. She kindly addressed him with a question 
whether he had studied the languages. " I have mastered 
them thoroughly," he replied. " Do you speak Hebrew ?" 
she asked. " I do," was the answer. " Then will you do 
me the favor to do your swearing in Hebrew ?" she asked. 
The rebuke was effectual. 

With regard to the use of slang words by a lady, we are 
reminded of the grisly fairy story of. a beautiful young 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 535 

woman from whose mouth, when she opened it, dropped 
frogs and toads. The practice of slang is as Unworthy of a 
gentleman as it is of a lady. 

Civility in speech is due to every person, and on all occa- 
sions. Employers would do well to remember that civil 
words, with kind and thoughtful actions, make friends of 
workmen or servants. Their use tends to bind more closely 
those who are already friends. Arrogance of speech and 
manner toward inferiors is on a par with servility toward 
superiors. True dignity and self-respect will lead to a cor- 
rect deportment in dealing with either. There is a possi- 
bility of being over-civil. Promptly pick up anything that 
a lady lets fall, but do not rush to wait upon even a iriend, 
lest you become servile in your attentions to the embarrass- 
ment of both yourself and your friend. You will not, how- 
ever, fail in proper attention to elderly people. A nice 
sense of respect for the aged and kind attentions to them 
show a good heart. 

General fussiness ought to be carefully avoided. Whether 
well or sick, it is needless, and entails a great deal of trou- 
ble and annoyance upon our friends. " There is nothing 
more fatal to comfort, as well as to decorum of behavior, 

than fuss." 

AFFECTATION. 

Affectation of any kind is ridiculous in any one. It may 
be termed " posing for effect." An article in Harper's 
Bazar Book paints some specimens : " The delicate young 
lady with the languid air, the listless step, or die-away pos- 
ture ! The literary young lady with the studiously ne- 
glected toilette, the carefully exposed breadth of forehead, 
. and the ever-present but seldom-read book ! The abste- 
mious young lady, who surreptitiously feeds on chops at 
private lunch and starves on a pea at the public dinner ! 
The humane young lady, who pulls Tom's ears and other- 
wise tortures brother and sister in the nursery and does her 



53G THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

utmost to fall into convulsions before company at the sight 
of a dead fly ! and the fastidious young lady, who faints — 
should there be an audience to behold the scene — at the 
sight of roast goose, but whose robust appetite vindicates 
itself by devouring all that is left of the unclean animal when 
a private opportunity will allow. Such affectations are not 
only absurd — for they are perfectly transparent — but ill-bred, 
as shams of all kinds essentially are." 

Sidney Smith says : " All affectation proceeds from the 
supposition of possessing something better than the rest of 
the world possesses. Nobody is vain of possessing two 
legs and two arms, because that is the precise quantity of 
either sort of limb which everybody possesses." The 
affected individual is always full of self-consciousness, and 
this is simple vulgarity. A truly polite person is too busy 
in considering the comfort and welfare of others to devote 
much time to thoughts of a purely selfish character. 

DRESS, 

Closely related to personal habits is the question of dress. 
It has been well said that "the result of the finest toilet 
should be an elegant woman, not an elegantly dressed 
woman." Chesterfield's advice to his son was sensible, and 
applies well to our own times : " Dress yourself fine where 
others are fine, and plain where others are plain ; but take 
care always that your clothes are well made and fit you, for 
otherwise they will give you a very awkward air. When 
you are once well dressed for the day, think no more of it 
afterward, and without any stiffness for fear of discomposing 
that dress, let all your motions be easy and natural, as if 
you had no clothes on at all." 

The objects of dress may be considered as threefold : To 
secure personal comfort and health, to preserve modesty, 
and to please the taste. Of men's clothing there is not 
much to say, except that it should be of quiet colors and 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 537 

well fitting. There is little opportunity for either contrasts 
or harmonious combinations of colors. But with the dress 
of women it is different. The most costly materials will fail 
to produce an agreeable impression unless their colors are 
carefully blended and the dressing forms a pleasing har- 
mony in its general effect. 

Ladies of a medium size may, perhaps, wear a dress with 
large figures, plaids, or stripes, if the prevailing fashions 
allow it ; but either large or small ladies would scarcely be 
in taste to wear either. Much drapery is not becoming to 
a short and stout person, while one who is slender may be 
improved in appearance by drapery. Then, as to tints : it is 
well known that fair complexions require delicate tints, while 
brunettes require rich, dark shades. 

Dresses should be carefully fitted to the form, yet not so 
that the natural functions of the body be impeded. Give 
nature room to move and breathe, and many a painful ex- 
perience in bodily suffering will be prevented. By all means 
avoid tight belts about the waist. The dress should be be- 
coming, and it will then be in taste. It should not be so 
noticeable that special attention would be attracted to it. 
To be entirely out of fashion is to be eccentric, yet a true 
independence will not lead to a servile following of every 
fashionable folly in dress that may appear. To be indiffer- 
ent to one's proper appearance is a sign of indolence and 
slovenliness 

There should be consistency in dress. That is, there 
should be regard to one's circumstances in life, so that what 
cannot be afforded without pecuniary embarrassment never 
should be worn. The dress should be in harmony with the 
occasion. A ball-dress at a funeral would not be more out 
of place than the rich toilette of the drawing-room is found 
to be when chosen for a walking-suit. 

But if there is one place more than another where great 
elegance and showiness of dress are out of taste, it is in the 



538 Tim HOUSEiVIFKS LIBRARY. 

House of God, where all should meet in equal humility 
before Him in whose sight outward adornment passes for 
nothing. Paley says, " If ever the poor man holds up his head, 
it is at church ; if ever the rich man views him with respect, it 
is there, and both will be the better, and the public profited, 
the oftener they meet in a situation in which the conscious- 
ness of dignity in the one is tempered and mitigated, and 
the spirit of the other erected and confirmed." 

Regard should also be had to one's pursuits and sur- 
roundings. A business attire should be neat and not 
showy ; its material serviceable and of a sober color. A 
traveling attire should be such as will furnish comfort and 
protection from dust and dirt ; soft neutral tints and smooth 
surface are best. Anything which would attract special 
attention from felloe-travelers should be scrupulously 
avoided. 

MOURNING ATTIRE. 

Where persons wear mourning for style rather than feel- 
ing, they will consult the fashion of the day. Deep 
mourning requires the heaviest black material with crape 
collar and cuffs. Ruffles, bows, and flounces are inadmis- 
sible. The bonnet must be of black crape ; the veil of crape 
or barege with heavy border ; black gloves and black- 
bordered handkerchiefs ; jet pins and buckles ; no jewels. A 
widow wears mourning for two years ; for a parent or child, 
mourning is worn for one year ; for a grandparent, mourning 
is worn for six months ; the same for a brother or sister ; 
for an uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, three months. 
There are some good people, however, who from principle 
never on any occasion allow themselves to wear mourning 
habiliments, believing the practice to be contrary to a 
Christian faith. Aside from this exception ladies should 
always wear black dresses at funerals, and in this excep- 
tional case plain dresses are always worn. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 



539 



PERFUMES. 

It may be that some will think a perfume of some sort is 
essential to complete the toilet. " The most refined people, 
however, avoid personal perfumes, and hold that the absence 
of all odor is the best savor of human communion. Those 
of nice taste eschew all perfumes but those that are evanes- 
cent, such as cologne and the like." A strong perfume of 
any kind is not desirable, if, indeed, it be not actually vul- 
gar. There is always a suggestion that it conceals some 
foulness. 

POLITENESS AT HOME. 

We come now to consider Polite Deportment in the 
domain of home, which ought to be to us the most sacred 
and beautiful place on earth. It may be said in general that 
it is the duty of every member of a family to do all that is 
possible to promote the happiness of the other members. 
It is necessary, therefore, to bear and forbear ; to make 
mutual concessions; to keep down selfishness ; to cultivate 
a love of justice and honor; to get rid of our petty likes 
and dislikes ; to conquer and control our temper. Much 
may be done by a nice attention to the requirements of 
etiquette, by an observance of those laws which govern the 
decencies and proprieties of life. There is no reason why 
a husband should not treat his wife with exquisite polite- 
ness ; why a wife should not remember that her husband 
has a claim to be treated like a gentleman ; why the finest 
manners should not be observed by brothers and sisters. 
This mutual courtesy, inspired by mutual love, would purify 
the atmosphere of home, and invest with a new dignity 
our domestic relations. 

A DOMESTIC PICTURE. 

Suppose we present a single day in such a home as might 
exist anywhere. It is early morning. An understood signal 



540 Tl'IE HO USE WIFE'S LIBKAR Y. 

indicates the time for breakfast to be reasonably near. Plans 
carefully made require that the family come together at the 
morning meal promptly, that the happiness of each may be 
conserved. Sufficient time is taken to become suitably 
attired to meet the household, and to so arrange the sleep- 
ing-room that no one need hesitate to enter lest sense and 
taste may be offended. Everything is left in good order. 
The washstand or basin is emptied ; the towels properly 
hung up ; the bed-clothing turned over the foot-board ; arti- 
cles of wearing apparel not in use, put away. Without 
haste or perturbation the family meet in the dining-room 
and sit down together ; grace is said ; hot and savory food 
is brought on ; cheerful conversation seasons the hour ; re- 
spect is shown to parents and superiors ; the servants are 
treated with kind consideration ; sufficient time is secured 
for the purposes of the meal by planning for it, hence there 
is no bolting of food and rushing off in disorder to meet a 
train or to get to business in due season. 

Either at the end or the centre sits father, perhaps carv- 
ing the steak, but certainly making himself useful, as well 
as ornamental. Opposite is the serene-faced mother, justly 
proud of her honorable position. On one side perhaps the 
aged grandmother, giving her meed of sunshine to the 
board. The prattle of children's voices mingles occasionally 
in conversation. In honor each prefers the other, and all 
contribute to the peace and glory of the home. 

The personal habits, of which so full mention has already 
been made, now show their effects. The politeness which 
begins in personal conditions is now working outwardly. 
There are no slovens here — there could not be. Gentleness 
and civility rule the hour. Why should they not be more 
marked at home than anywhere else ? There is not a word 
of slander or defamation. Peace toward each other ; charity 
toward all. Hans Christian Andersen's story of the cobweb 
cloth, so finely woven that it was invisible, and specially 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 541 

made for the King's garment, stands perhaps for the sweet 
manners which are the fine and kingly clothing of royal 
souls. 

Domestic duties for the day follow the morning repast. 
Father is away at business, the children at school, and the 
elder ones of the household fully occupied. There is found 
time for healthful reading, for the good wife has early 
learned that she must not fall behind lier husband or chil- 
dren in personal and religious culture Both, in their deal- 
ing with the world of people and the world of books, are 
constantly growing. She must keep up with them or lose 
their genuine respect. Moreover, she must be able to 
direct the tastes of her family in reading, that they may be 
fitted for cultivated society, and be enabled thereby to do 
well their parts in life. The best literature of the day has 
place upon table or shelf, and is read with pleasure and 
profit. 

Perhaps one of the family is ill. The soft tread and gen- 
tle care show that politeness is not wanting in extremity 
and in bodily suffering. There is no slamming of doors ; 
no boisterous talking ; no disregard of a single thing which 
relates to the comfort of the invalid. A due regard for the 
suffsrer leads to a gentle tap at the door before entering ; 
the ignoring of little things which are not agreeable in the 
sick one's surroundings or condition ; and patience in the 
rendering of such attentions as may be needed ; with an 
affectionate interest born of a really good heart. 

The shadows are creeping on apace as the day draws to 
its close, and the family is now gathered for dinner. It is 
thought worth their while for each to be in becoming attire, 
to dress for each other quite as neatly as if the outside 
world were looking on. There is true grace and beautiful 
simplicity. The " shop " is left behind. Markets, bonds, 
stocks, worry and fret, are not brought home at the close of 
the business day. Conversation does not lag. There is 



542 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

room for each to have part, and what some might think the 
trivial things in children's experience receive their meed of 
attention and honor. There is no slang ; no impolite lan- 
guage ; no " street talk ;" no reference to disgusting sub- 
jects. The family sit naturally erect, without lounging or 
appearing to be tired. Elbows are not planted on the table ; 
napkins are not adjusted under the chin like bibs ; no one 
appears to be greedy for food, neither is there any dainti- 
ness that is unsuitable. There is no effort to talk while the 
mouth is full. There is no coughing, or sneezing, or other 
disgusting noises with nose or mouth. The knife is only 
used to cut the food, while the fork and spoon are used to 
convey food to the mouth. Great care is taken that the 
tablecloth be not soiled. The carving is done neatly, ex- 
peditiously, and courteously. There is neither a niggardly 
supply nor an overloading of plates. It seems as if carving 
were no trouble, and that it gave pleasure to supply what' 
ever is desired by any one at the table. 

If any little accident happens, no notice is taken of it — 
no frowns, no muttering of reproof The servants share in 
the politeness. " Please " is not omitted when a request is 
made.. A "thank you" is not infrequent. The quietness 
of the meal is not broken by noises made by mastication, or 
smacking the lips, or gulping of liquids. When the meal 
is concluded, the whole family rise from the table, and now 
the " children's hour " is in order. 

The children have learned that there is a time to play 
and a time when not to play, as well as how to play without 
interfering with the enjoyment of others. There is kindness, 
good temper, and politeness. There are no rude and offen- 
sive practical jokes perpetrated. There is universal mirth 
and cheerfulness ; there is gayety and life. When the' 
proper hour arrives for the children to retire there is neither 
teasing nor sulks. A beautiful night closes upon a beauti- 
ful day for them in the home and the good-night kiss blesses 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 543 

each in order. If friends call, they are made welcome, and 
the evening is spent no less pleasantly than the day was 
begun. It is all the result of good nature and good man- 
agement, combined with good sense and religious principle. 
An eminent authority in household etiquette says : " Let 
no one suppose that because a good wife lives in a small 
house and dines on homely fare the general principles of 
polite deportment do not apply to her. A small house is 
more easily kept clean than a palace. Taste may be quite 
as well displayed in the arrangement of dishes on a pine 
table as in grouping the silver and china of the rich. Skill 
in cooking is as readily shown in a baked potato or johnny- 
cake as in a canvas-back duck. The charm of good house- 
keeping 'lies in a nice attention to little things, not in a 
superabundance. A dirty kitchen and bad cooking have 
driven many a husband and son, and many a daughter, too, 
from a home that should have been a refuge from tempta- 
tion. Bad dinners go hand in hand with total depravity, 
while a properly fed man is already half saved." / 

AWAY FROM HOME. 

If people are well bred at home, their deportment when 
away from home, in ordinary social intercourse, will be such 
as befits the true -gentleman or lady. They will then reflect 
the home life. But, being in the homes of others, there will 
be certain formalities and restraints which are essential to 
the comfort or rights of those whom they may meet. These 
should always be recognized and regarded. A careful 
observance of them will also promote your own comfort and 
well-being. 

INTRODUCTIONS. 

Introductions, more or less formal, are necessary. They 
may form the basis of enjoyment for a brief period, or of a 
lasting friendship. It is usually the way by which parties 
become acquainted. Sometimes persons are obliged to 



544 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

introduce themselves, and in such cases, unless well known 
by reputation, there may be some risk in forming an 
acquaintance. No one will presume on an acquaintance so 
formed unless it is accepted in the most unmistakable 
manner. 

It is not necessary to introduce a friend to every one you 
meet, without regard to time or place. This must, however, 
depend upon the good sense of the parties concerned. It 
might be very rude not to introduce a friend, even though 
the parties so introduced might never meet again. As a 
rule, we should always be sure that an introduction would 
be mutually desirable ; hence, one should never introduce 
a gentleman to a lady, for instance, without first obtaining 
her consent. An introduction of any kind implies an 
indorsement of character. It is right sometimes to decline 
giving an introduction where there is the least doubt of the 
propriety of so doing. 

Gentlemen, whatever their rank, should be presented to 
ladies ; young men to elderly men ; young women to 
elderly women ; those of lower rank to persons of higher 
rank. When a gentleman is introduced to another gentle- 
man, each offers a hand ; when a gentleman is introduced 
to a lady, he should wait for her to offer her hand. If she 
does not do so, he must be content with a bow. 

At dinner-parties general introductions are unnecessary ; 
though it is to be assumed that you would not seat at the 
same table persons whom you would not wish to know each 
other. In sending your guests down to dinner you must, 
of course, introduce the lady to her destined partner, if they 
happen to be unacquainted. In this case you do not ask 
the lady's permission. At morning calls, if the callers 
arrive at the same time the hostess will introduce them to 
each other, unless she has good grounds for believing that 
the introduction would be disagreeable or unsuitable. At 
" five-o'clock teas " and similar receptions the hostess must 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 545 

introduce her principal guests to each other ; but in doing 
so she must exercise a due discretion and assort her guests 
with all possible discrimination. 

Between gentlemen the form of introduction may be very 
simple, as : " Mr. A., my friend, Mr. B.," where the parties 
are of equal station in life and about the same age. Other- 
wise, it is better to say : " Mr. A., allow me to introduce 
my friend, Mr. B." As a means of starting conversation 
and so placing both parties at their ease, a remark should 
be added, explaining the business, or residence, or any other 
item which may be considered of interest, especially if the 
party introduced is on a trip for business or pleasure. 

An introduction to a lady should always be more formal. 
The usual way is to bow to the lady, or slightly wave the 
hand, and say : " Mrs. B., permit me to introduce my 
friend, Mr. D. ;" or, in case an introduction has been 
sought : " Mrs. B., I take pleasure in presenting my friend, 
Mr. D." The precise form is immaterial, so that the proper 
order be observed. The introduction should be recognized 
by each bowing to the other and each repeating the other's 
name. The gentleman should say : " I am glad to have the 
pleasure of meeting you," or something of similar import. 

It is hardly necessary to say that the names of the parties 
should always be uttered distinctly. If either party fails to 
understand the name of the other, it is proper to say : " I 
beg your pardon ; I did not understand the name ;" where- 
upon it should be repeated. 

When several are to be introduced to one person, the 
name of the latter should be distinctly spoken, and then the 
names of the parties introduced should be mentioned in 
succession, with a slight bow as each name is called. 
Where relatives are introduced, care should be taken to 
give both the degree of kinship and the name. For instance : 
" My father, Mr. C. ;" or. " My son, Mr. C." One's wife is 
simply designated as " Mrs. A," 



646 Tim HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

It is proper always to recognize the title of one who ia 
introduced— as, " Rev. Mr. A. ;" or, " Rev. Dr. B. ;" or, 
" Honorable Mr. C./' if the party is a Congressman ; or, 
" Senator J.," and so on. Sometimes a complimentary 
remark may be well — as, " Mr.' Jones, whose recent work 
on esthetics has given us so much pleasure." 

An adherence to etiquette is a mark of respect. If a man 
be worth knowing, he is surely worth the trouble of ap- 
proaching properly. It will likewise relieve you from the 
awkwardness of being acquainted with people of whom you 
might at times be ashamed, or be obliged under any circum- 
stances to " cut." Take care not to know anybody whom 
you will be obliged to " cut." " Cutting " is simply declin- 
ing to recognize a person to whom you have previously 
been introduced. It may be done direct by a cold look, as 
if to an entire stranger ; or indirectly, by averting the face 
on passing and not returning, by word or manner, an offered 
salutation. 

SALUTATIONS AND GREETINGS. 

Salutations, and greetings are very simple among Ameri- 
cans. The most common phrases are " Good morning," 
" Good afternoon," " Good evening," " How are you ?" and 
" How do you do ?" Some people simply say " Howdy ?" 
or " How d'ye ?" but the latter never should be indulged in 
except between intimate friends ; it is perhaps not in taste 
at any time. A pleasant smile and slight bow is desirable 
as an accompaniment to the words spoken. The most 
affectionate form of salution is the kiss, which is only proper 
among near relatives and dear friends. The practice of 
women kissing each other in public is held to be decidedly 
vulgar, and had better be avoided. A due respect to child- 
hood ought to prevent the liberty so often taken of kissing 
young girls who, though mortified, dare not resent it. There 
is no more propriety in kissing a child without its consent 



FOLITE DEPORTMENT. 547 

than there is of kissing a grown woman under the same cir- 
cumstances. 

HAND-SHAKING. 

With regard to hand-shaking, a few suggestions may 
cover the points that are worthy of remembrance. It is not 
well to offer to shake hands with every one in a drawing- 
room; if the host or hostess offers a hand, take it; a bow 
will do for the rest. Hand-shaking is not admissible in a 
formal party or ball-room. The initiative, in hand-shaking, 
must always come from the lady, from the elder to the 
younger, and from the one higher in rank. But in no case 
let there be the " mutilated courtesy," as Goldsmith calls 
it, in which by the touch of one or two fingers in a pre- 
tended hand-shaking a mere mockery of civility is rendered 
in place of true courtesy. 

Remember that there is a right and a wrong way of 
hand-shaking. It is horrible when your unoffending digits 
are seized in the sharp compress of a kind of vise, and 
wrung and squeezed until you feel as if they were reduced 
to jelly. It is not less horrible when you find them lying in 
a limp, nerveless clasp, which makes no response to your 
hearty greeting, but chills you like a lump of ice. Shake 
hands as if you meant it, swiftly, strenuously, and courte- 
ously, neither using an undue pressure nor falling ^wholly 

supine. 

UNDUE FAMILIARITY. 

" Familiarity breeds contempt." Some forms of famili.- 
arity are positively odious, such as slapping your friend on 
the back or nudging him in the side. Such practices should 
never be indulged in or permitted. Indeed, there need be 
no occasion, as a rule, to touch people at all when you have 
occasion to address them. Again, some persons behave in 
a drawing-room as if they were the only guests, and the 
remainder of the company had been assembled to admire — 
at a distance — their intimacy with the hostess. This is an 



548 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

assumption of familiarity and a token of ill breeding. The 
same may be said of retaining upon the head one's hat in 
a strictly private office, which is no more justifiable than it 
would be to wear it in a drawing-room. 

Closely related to this latter is the loud and boisterous 
laugh, which is decidedly vulgar. A hearty laugh is pleas- 
ing, but a loud guffaw is never necessary in order to show 
heartiness, any more than a loud tone in talking is agree- 
able to the listener. 

There are many other acts which may be classed as vul- 
gar. Among these are humming and whistling ; standing 
with arms a-kimbo; lounging and yawning; addressing 
acquaintances by their Christian names ; playing practical 
jokes, and whispering in the presence of others. Yet 
there should not be diffidence and embarrassment in asso- 
ciating with either equals or superiors. For instance, there 
is a great art in entering a room. Some persons stride in 
with a shamefaced air, as if they thought they had no busi- 
ness across the threshold; others swagger in defiantly, 
with head erect and chest expanded, like a professional 
athlete making his appearance before his " patrons ;" others, 
again, steal in noiselessly, as if deprecating the slightest 
attention, and priding themselves on their humility. Enter 
a room as if you felt yourself entitled to a welcome, but 
wished to take no undue advantage of it. 

Having entered the room, one need not be in great haste 
to get into a chair. It may be as graceful, easy, and proper 
to stand for a while, and converse easily while in that atti- 
tude, yet a chair should be accepted when offered. 

CONVERSATION. 

The art of conversation is one which boasts of a sacred 
charter : " Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth 
the countenance of his friend ;" " As in water face answereth 
to face, so the heart of man to man." (Proverbs xxvii, 17, 19.) 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 549 

It is not possible to teach the art of conversation. On the 
other hand, it is not difficult to lay down certain general 
rules, the observance of which must be held as indispen- 
sable to the comfort of the company in which one finds 
himself 

For example, elaborate discussions of political and relig- 
ious subjects must be avoided. Our differences on these 
points go very deep, and any debate which forces them on 
our consideration cannot fail to awaken permanent feelings 
of irritation and dislike. 

However much in the right, yield with a good grace 
when you perceive that persistence in ventilating your 
opinions will result in open variance. The true spirit of 
conversation consists less in displaying one's own cleverness 
than in bringing out the cleverness of other people. Con- 
versation is the pasture-ground of the many, therefore it 
should keep to the levels. There are very few who can 
ascend the heights, and none ought to sink into the depths. 

Gesticulate as little as you can while speaking. Some 
people spread out their fingers like fans ; others point 
them at you menacingly, like so many darts; this man 
emphasizes his speech by bringing down one unfortunate 
hand into the palm of the other ; that man nods his head 
like a child's toy figure, and carries his arm up and down 
like a pump-handle. 

When any one is speaking do not yawn, nor hum an air, 
nor pick the teeth, nor drum with the fingers on a piece of 
furniture, nor whisper in a neighbor's ear, nor take a letter 
out of the pocket and read it, nor look at your watch. 

There is no flattery so exquisite as " the flattery of listen- 
ing." It may be doubted whether the greatest mind is ever 
proof against it. Socrates may have loved Plato best of all 
his disciples because he listened best. To listen well is 
almost as indispensable as to talk well, and it is by the skill 
with which he listens that the man of bon ton and of good 
35 



550 THB tiuUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

society is known. If you wish people to listen to you, you' 
must listen to them. Let not your patience give way when 
elderly people are garrulous. Respect old age, even when 
it twaddles ; you yourself may live to require the indul- 
gence which you are now recommended to exercise. 

There are social Munchausens whose narratives make 
tremendous demands on your credulity. Do not express 
your belief in what you disbelieve, for that would be to 
utter a falsehood; do not express an open dissent, for that 
would be to commit a rudeness. Take refuge in a courte- 
ous silence, and — change the subject. 

Be careful how you exercise your wit. If curses, like 
chickens, come home to roost, so do epigrams. Do not 
applaud the wit which is leveled at your friend ; it may next 
be directed against yourself. Do not give another> even if 
it be a better, version of a story already told by one of your 
companions. Be careful how you distribute praise or blame 
to your neighbors — some of those present will have their 
prejudices or partialities, which you will be sure to offend — 
and on no account interrupt or contradict a person who may 
be speaking. 

Speak of yourself as little as possible. If you speak in 
praise, you expose yourself to ridicule ; if you blame your- 
self, nobody will think you in earnest, and it will be assumed 
that you are seeking for compliments, or that you are 
merely affecting humility ; or if your vanity be excused, it 
will be at the expense of your intelligence — if you are not 
vain, you must be stupid. 

Do not " talk shop," that, is, unless .specially requested ; 
do not talk of your professional occupation, your private 
studies, or your personal belongings, neither of your house, 
nor your "wife, nor your servant, nor your property. 

Do not pay compliments unless you can do so with grace, 
and in such a manner that, though the person on whom 
the sweet flattery is bestowed recognize it as undeserved, 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 551 

he or she may still believe that on your part it is perfectly 
sincere. Dean Swift says pithily : " Nothing is so great 
an instance of ill-manners as flattery. If you flatter all the 
company you please none ; if you flatter only one or two 
you affront the rest." But an elegant compliment at an 
opportune moment, and spoken with an air of frankness, 
carries with it an irresistible charm. 

To be a good talker requires much general information, 
which may be acquired by observation, reading and study, 
and listening to dthers. To this must be added a good 
memory, which can be cultivated by proper effort ; a right 
knowledge and use of language, and clear enunciation. 
The use of such vulgarisms as " awfully nice," " abominably 
horrid," " dreadfully stupid," and the like, are always to be 
avoided. It is a bad habit which is very close to untruth- 
fulness. Very few people would utter a willful lie, yet 
many become untrustworthy because of their habit of 
exaggeration and false coloring. 

FORMAL CALLS. 

The formal call is a mere device for keeping up acquaint- 
ance. Once or twice a year is regarded as sufficiently often 
to meet fashionable requirements. Simply sending cards 
sometimes takes the place of a call. A " morning call " 
means generally any call made in the daytime, and is a 
mere matter of ceremony. It should not be made in the 
forenoon, nor just previous to the usual hour of luncheon, 
nor later than five in the afternoon. Local customs govern 
the matter of special days for receiving calls. 

When a lady for any reason prefers not to see callers, 
the servant is usually instructed to say that she is engaged, 
or " not at home." As the latter is not strictly correct, a 
regard to truthfulness should prevent the statement. A 
polite mention that the lady could not receive callers ought 
to be sufficient To insist on seeing a person after such a 



552 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR V. 

message is the height of ill-manners on the part of the 
caller. 

In making a morning call a gentleman should take hat 
and gloves with him into the parlor, but not his umbrella or 
his overshoes, and he should not remove his overcoat. In 
an evening call, all wraps, etc., should be left in the hall. 
While waiting for the person on whom you have called it is 
not right to walk about, examining pictures and other 
articles. A morning call should always be short, and one 
should not enter upon a subject of conversation which may 
terrify the hostess with the apprehension that you intend to 
remain until you have exhausted it. 

In calling on a newly married couple, do not congratulate 
the lady upon her marriage, but the bridegroom. He, of 
course, is fortunate in having found any one to accept him ; 
her good luck may be more problematical. A visit to a 
newly married couple is not a visit of condolence. Be brisk 
in your manner, therefore ; wear a smile ; and if there be a 
feeling of pity at your heart, do your utmost to prevent its 
outward manifestation. 

When ready to leave, arise and go. Do not linger and 
talk and act as if you wished you had not started. Make 
your adieus and depart at once — ^yet not in haste. If there 
are other callers, bow to them collectively. 

After a party or dinner at a friend's house you should call 
within a week thereafter. 

VISITING. 

Visiting is a privilege that is often abused. Only firm 
friendship can justify it. One should not be too fast to ac- 
cept an invitation — certainly not a mere " come and see us 
sometime." Be sure that you are ■ really wanted, and do 
not prolong your stay until your welcome is clean worn out. 
During a visit one should conform very strictly to the usual 
habits of the house, always being on hand and ready at the 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 553 

usual times for meals, and never keep the family up after 
their usual time for retiring. If unpleasant matters apoear 
they should not be noticed, and in general one's presence 
ought to be the least possible occasion of trouble. Upon 
returning home, the family should receive a pleasant letter, 
renewing expressions of pleasure given when about to take 
leave of the hostess. 

VISITING-CARDS. 

As cards have so important a place in etiquette, it will be 
■well to consult a reliable stationer as to styles in order to 
avoid mistakes. The neat round-hand and angular script 
has of late taken the place of old English type on cards. 
Only the name should be on a card. A business card never 
should be used for a friendly call. A physician may put 
" Dr." or " M. D." in addition to his name, and an Army or 
Navy officer his rank and branch of service. 

In case a card is left in person when making a call, one 
•corner should be turned down if for the lady of the house ; 
if folded in the middle, it will indicate that the call is on 
several members of the family. A card should be left for 
each guest of the family. 

" P. P. C." {Pour prendre conge) should be written in one 
•corner of a card left at a farewell visit, before a protracted 
absence. Such cards may be sent by mail. Ladies about 
to be married sometimes send them in place of making a 
call. 

An expert in the science of good manners has recently 
spoken thus on visiting-cards : " Care should be taken to 
conform with present usage and to avoid anything con- 
sidered to be in questionable taste, for a card is the repre- 
sentative of oije's-self To the unrefined or underbred 
person the visiting-card is but a trifling and insignificant 
piece of paper ; but to the cultured disciple of social law it 
conveys a subtle and unmistakable intelligence. Its texture, 



654 " THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

style of engraving, and even the hour of leaving it, combine 
to place the stranger whose name it bears in a pleasant or a 
disagreeable attitude — even before his manners, conversa 
tion, and face have been able to explain his social position. 
The higher the civilization of a community, the more careful 
it is to preserve the elegance of its social forms. It is quite 
as easy to express a perfect breeding in the fashionable for- 
malities of cards as by any other method, and perhaps, 
indeed, it is the safest herald of an invitation for a stranger. 
Its texture should be fine, its engraving a plain script, its 
size neither too small, so that its recipients shall say to 
themselves, ' A whimsical person,' nor too large, to suggest 
ostentation. Refinement seldom touches extremes in any- 
thing." 

RECEPTIONS. 

Receptions usually occur from four to seven in the after- 
noon, when light refreshments are served. Invitations to 
them are usually infoftnal. If " R. S. V. P." is on a corner 
of such invitation it is proper to send answer. Otherwise, 
no answer is required. All who are invited are expected to 
call soon afterward — within two weeks at most. Invitations 
are generally issued in the name of the lady of the house, 
and are usually engraved in the lower left-hand corner of 
her visiting-card — thus : 



Mrs. 


John 


Thomasson. 


Thursday f February third. 




Tea at Four o'clock. 


lo Trafalgar Place. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 



555 



If assisted by a daughter or a friend, the name of such 
assistant is engraved below her own on the card. Some- 
times the cards are larger and in the following form : 



Mr. 


AND Mrs. 


Thomas 


Jackson, 




AT 


HOME, 




Thursday^ Pecemher sixths 






From Three until Seven o'clock. 


150 Tremont Ave. 



These cards, now used in square form, should be inclosed 
in two envelopes when sent by mail. If delivered by mes- 
senger, one inclosure is sufficient. 

DINNERS. 

The Etiquette of Dinners is worthy of more space than 
we can give to it. When an invited guest, be sure not to 
be late. It would be a wrong to your host, to other guests, 
and to the dinner. Persons invited should be of the same 
standing in society, though not necessarily acquaintances. 
Invitations should be in the name of the gentleman and 
lady of the house, and should be issued at least a week in 
advance. They should be answered immediately, in order 
that the hosts may know who are to be their guests. When 
an engagement has been made it should be kept, if at all 
possible. It is not proper to invite a gentleman without 
his wife, or vice versa, unless it be an occasion when gen- 
tlemen alone are to be present. The usual time for dinners 
is from five to eight o'clock. 

A dinner-table is said to be laid for so many " covers." 



556 ^-^-^^ ^O USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

A " cover " comprises : Two large knives ; three large forlcs-, 
silver knife and fork for fish; tablespoon for soup; wine- 
glass for sherry ; wine-glass for hock ; wine-glass for cham- 
pagne. Where wines are not used, of course the glasses 
are omitted. In the centre, between the knives and forks, 
is placed the dinner-bread wrapped up in a serviette. The 
dessertspoons and small forks are placed before the guests 
on an empty plate before the sweets are passed around, and 
extra knives and forks are supplied as they are required. 

In the main things of a dinner, the fillet and roast, there 
is little change, but in minor things the caterer rules. To 
begin with oysters, five, not six, is now the fashionable num- 
ber for the half shells. ' At formal dinners it is the invariable 
rule that ladies and gentlemen should be seated alternately, 
never allowing two ladies or two gentlemen to sit together. 
At dinners of eight, twelve, or sixteen persons, this can be 
managed only by putting gentlemen at both ends of the 
table. Hostesses generally have a prejudice against giving 
up their customary seat, forgetting the old saying : " Where 
the Douglas sits, there is the head of the table," and avoid 
the awkward number. 

When there are more ladies than gentlemen at the din- 
ner-party, the hostess should go down alone, and leave the 
gentleman of highest rank to take down the lady of second 
rank ; in this case the gentleman will place himself at table 
on the right of the hostess. In passing from the drawing- 
room to the dining-room, remember that it is the lady who 
takes precedence, not the gentleman. 

A gentleman must help the lady whom he has escorted 
to the table, but it is not proper to offer his help to other 
ladies who have escorts. If the guests pass the dishes, 
always help yourself before handing to the next. If at 
dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce, do not 
pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side. It 
you should have to carve and help a joint, do not load a 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 557 

person's plate — it is vulgar ; also, in serving soup, one 
ladleful to each plate is sufficient. 

Conversation at the table should be participated in by all, 
and should include only such subjects as will be agreeable 
to all. It is rudeness for one or two to monopolize the 
talking, and centre upon themselves a general attention. 

When the guests have finished, the hostess can indicate, 
by rising, the time for departure from the table, when the 
return to the drawing-room can be in the order in which 
they are seated without regard to preference. 

AFTER DINNER. 

An hour or more of social intercourse will follow. It 
will be well if some of the company are musicians. In 
case one is invited to sing or play there should be graceful 
compliance, but it is not well to sing or play more than one 
piece imless specially urged. It is better not to risk boring 
the company with your performance, however good it may 
be. When people are singing, do them the courtesy of 
listening, or pretending to listen. If you do not like music 
yourself, remember that others may. Besides, when a per- 
son is endeavoring to entertain you, the least you can do is 
to show your gratitude for the intention. 

Upon taking leave, express pleasure to the host and hos- 
tess, but do not offer thanks in any case. A call should be 
made soon afterward. 

Dinner cards are so useful that they will not soon go out 
of fashion. The shops are full of them, and beautiful ones 
are coming over from Paris. Of a dozen recently used the 
owner said : " They cost almost as much as a dress." 
Each fan was painted and signed by a well-known artier, 
and bore the name of a guest. They suggested the lavish- 
ness of Lucullus in ancient times, and in modern that 
famous bonanza banquet in San Francisco, where every 
lady's dinner card was a point lace handkerchief.

MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARIES. 

Marriage anniversaries are popularly designated as fol- 
lows: 

First Anniversary, Paper Wedding. 

Second " Cotton 

Third " Leather " 

Fifth " Wooden " 

Tenth " Tin 

Fifteenth " Crystal " 

Twentieth " Floral " 

Twenty-fifth" Silver 

Thirtieth " Pearl 

Thirty-fifth " China 

Fortieth " Coral « 

Forty-fifth " ...:.' Bronze " 

Fiftieth " ...... Golden. " 

Sixtieth " Diamond " 

It is proper to say that some of these, in the preceding 
list, are not often celebrated. Cards of wood, tin, etc., are no 
longer used, the invitations being issued on square white 
cards or note sheets, in plain, neat script. The words " No 
Gifts," are often engraved in the lower left-hand corner of 
the invitation. The ceremonies on such occasions are some- 
what according to the taste and desire of the parties and 
the length of time they may have been married. The ear- 
lier occasions afford opportunities for merriment ; the later 
ones, for the deeper emotions, mingled with pleasure and 
satisfaction. 

COURTSHIP. 

With regard to courtship, it may briefly be said that its 
freedom should not be abused by license, and that the par- 
ties ought to regard each other sacredly if their troth is 
plighted. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 



559 



Upon engagement, the gentleman presents the lady with 
a ring, to be worn on the third finger of the right hand. 
While engaged, neither party should be occupied in flirta- 
tions with the opposite sex, yet both should reasonably 
mingle in society. The gendeman is always thereafter the 
legitimate escort of the lady and should not devote himself 
in any marked manner to any other lady. 

Society wisely discourages all conspicuous manifestations 
of personal feeling. Lovers are not expected to " make 
love " in public, nor married couples to afford extravagant 
evidence of conjugal tenderness ; and the sincerity of the 
affection may reasonably be doubted which parades itself in 
public. When our hearts are deeply moved we do not take 
the world into our confidence. On the other hand, constant 
bickering and bantering between husband and wife in public 
is equally objectionable, even though it be only " in fun." 

WEDDINGS. 

The etiquette of weddings varies greatly according to 
circumstances. After invitations are issued the lady does 
not appear in public. The invitations should be handsomely 
engraved. Any reputable stationer will be able to suggest 
the proper forms and styles. The invitations are engraved 
in the name of the father and mother of the bride, or if 
neither are living, then in the name of her guardian or near- 
est relation. 

The forms and ceremonies of weddings are generally in 

accordance with the wishes of the bride. But, whether the 

wedding ceremonies be at home or in church, a beautiful 

simplicity is certainly more pleasing than an ostentatious 

display. 

PUBLIC PLACES. 

Proper regard is necessary to the rules of polite deport- 
ment in public places. Let your walk in life be distinguished 
by unassuming grace. , Look from your window and observe 



560 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the gait of the passers-by. You will see at once " what to 
avoid " — the tread of the grenadier, the clumsy shuffle, the 
dancing-master's trip, the heel-and-toe movement, the pre- 
tentious slide. But it is easier to know what to avoid than 
what to imitate. Perhaps imitation is not advisable, and the 
chief thing to remember is that you should walk as if your 
body had a soul in it. Virgil tells us of Juno that you saw 
the goddess in her gait, and " grace in her steps " is one of 
the characteristics of Milton's " Eve." 

Observation, which, " with extensive view, surveys man- 
kind from China to Peru," shows that in the country gentle- 
men do not offer their arm to ladies, but in large towns this 
should be done as a measure of protection and a token of 
respect. 

When you meet a friend in the street it must depend on 
your degree of intimacy whether you walk with him or not ; 
but with a lady you must not walk, unless she directly or 
indirectly invite you. 

Gentlemen do not take off their hats to one another; this 
is a courtesy reserved for the ladies. Gentlemen generally 
recogiiize each other with a nod. If you pass an acquaint- 
ance with a lady on his arm, do not nod; take off your hat, 
so that your salute may seem to embrace both your friend 
and the lady. In bowing to a lady in the street, lift your 
hat right off your head. Don't allow her to suppose that 
you wear a wig and are afraid to disarrange it. If you pass 
a friend with a lady whom you do not know, you must lift 
your hat to him and not nod. 

Should you tread upon or stumble against any one, do 
not fail to make immediate apology. Of course, you will 
not stare at nor point to people, nor carry umbrella or cane 
horizontally under your arm. Neither will you stop a lady 
on the street to talk with her. Turn and walk with her, 
rather, and lift your hat to her when you have finished the 
conversation and are about to leave her. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 5(31 

It is very rude to rush for a seat in a car or at a public 
entertainment. Better lose some comfort than be guilty of 
impoliteness. It is equally wrong to occupy more space 
than you are entitled to in a public conveyance ; and when 
at a place of amusement to disturb others by your conver- 
sation or remarks while the performance is going on is 
gross ill-breeding. A polite person will always have regard 
for the comfort of those who are near. 

In public halls a gentleman should precede the lady 
whose escort he is, unless there is an usher preceding them.. 
He should give her the inner seat and remain by her side. 
He is under no obligation to give up his seat to another 
lady and should avoid everything that might attract notice 
to himself or his companion. 

In church there should always be deference and respect 
to the worshipers, whether or not you agree with them. 
Stay away if you cannot be respectful and attentive to the 
services. It is not right to go late, to the possible disturb- 
ance of the worship. It is rude to turn around and gaze at 
any one, to watch people coming in with critical glances, to 
talk or laugh, and so disturb others, or to leave until the 
dismission. 

TRAVELING. 

In our country almost every one travels, and a few hints- 
will be serviceable to those who may not have traveled a 
great deal. Always keep your head and arms inside the 
car window. Remember that it is not necessary to be in- 
trusive in order to be polite. Take your time in getting on 
or off the cars ; nothing is gained by haste. Avoid being 
boisterous and do not try to make yourself conspicuous. 
Never disclose your business to the stranger in whose com- 
pany you may happen to be. 

Bear in mind that the comfort of others should be taken 
into consideration when you travel. Your open window 
may be a source of ereat annoyance and discomfort to your 



562 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

V 

neighbors. t)o not litter the seat you occupy with boxes 
and bundles to exclude other passengers from sharing with 
you the accommodation it affords. Respectfully decline 
any and all invitations extended by strangers with whom 
you are brought in contact to indulge in social games of 
cards. Do not ask the conductor foolish questions about 
the route ; remember that he is not familiar with the run- 
ning-time of all the roads in the United States. Do not 
address a lady who is unknown to you, unless she invite it. 
You may offer her your newspaper with a silent bow. An 
" unprotected " lady ought to call forth a gentleman's finest 
chivalry. 

If you have made some slight acquaintance with a lady 
in a railway carriage, you must not presume upon that to 
bow or speak to her at any accidental rencontre, unless she 
makes the first advances. 

Discretion should be used in forming acquaintances while 
traveling. Ladies may accept small and proper attentions, 
but any attempt at familiarity should be checked at once. 
A true gentleman will not offer any familiarity. The flirt- 
ing and freedom often indulged in by young people in public 
conveyances is unworthy of them — if, indeed, it does not 
indicate low breeding, and often leads to evil consequences. 
Whether at home or abroad, the same rules of good be-, 
havior should prevail. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

Correspondence is the medium by which people com-^ 
municate with each other when, for any reason, they cannot 
readily speak face to face. It should be characterized by 
the same politeness that marks the gentleman or lady in any 
relation of life. It will generally indicate character with 
considerable precision, unless there is studied concealment 
for a purpose. " It is as great a violation of propriety to 
send a carelessly prepared and badly written letter as it is to 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 553 

appear in the company of refined people with swaggering 
gait, soiled linen, and unkempt hair." It is at least a ques- 
tionable compliment to a friend to send a letter written with 
very pale ink, or with lines crossed and indistinct, or with 
other evidences of disregard of the objects which you are 
supposed to have had in mind when writing — namely, to 
communicate information in a pleasant way. It is not in 
taste for you to use postal cards, except on mere matters of 
business. When used, there is no need of any address, ex- 
cept upon the address side. You may omit the usual 
formalities of salutation in your communication, giving the 
post office and date at the top, and simply sign your name 
at the bottom. Postal cards never should be used for any 
matters that are in the least degree confidential. 

Private and personal letters should never be written on 
foolscap paper. What is known as " Commercial Note " is 
generally used by gentlemen, and a smaller size by ladies. 
Either ruled or plain paper is allowatele, but the latter is 
deemed more in style. Envelopes should correspond with 
the paper used, and should always be of a light color, when 
ladies are addressed. Business letters are almost uniformly 
written on half-sheets, but for a social letter a whole sheet 
should always be used, though only a portion be occupied. 
The writing should be plain, without flourishes, and be con- 
tinuous to the close without skipping a page. The inside 
address, following the date, should be such as the party 
named is entitled to receive, and the salutation such as is jus» 
tlfied by the personal relations of the writer. Business let- 
ters generally begin with Sir, Dear Sir, Sirs, or Gentlemen. 
Do not use " Gents " for gentlemen, nor " Dr." for dear. 
For a letter addressed to a married woman, or a single 
woman not young, the proper salutation is Madam, Dear 
Madam, or My dear Madam. Business letters to a young 
unmarried lady do not require any salutation, the name alone 
being regarded as sufficient. 



664 " THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

When your letter is written, it requires a respectful or 
affectionate conclusion and the signature. Business letters 
are generally cldsed with Yours, Yours truly, or Yours re- 
spectfully. Social letters admit- of a great variety of forms, 
according to the taste and feelings of the writer. Whatever 
else may be wanting in clearness, the signature should be 
plain, so that there may not be any chance for mistake in 
replying. It is proper and desirable that " Miss " or " Mrs." 
be prefixed to your signature when writing to strangers, 
that there may not be any doubt as to the manner of 
addressing a reply. 

When completed, your letter should be. neatly and care- 
fully folded, so that the edges will be exactly even, and 
inclosed in the envelope prepared for it by a proper outside 
address or superscription. The proper place for the postage 
stamp is the upper right-hand corner, and the stamp should 
be affixed squarely and head up. Postage should be fully 
paid. 

A letter should always have prompt reply. It is real 
incivility not to do so, especially if there be anything which 
specially calls for answer, and in beginning a reply the re- 
ception of the letter should be acknowledged, as a rule, in 
the first sentence. If for any reason a further correspon- 
dence is not desired, care should be taken to so write that 
there will not be anything calling for answer. It is well 
always to remember that your letter may sometime get into 
print without your knowledge or cons,ent, therefore do not 
write a word that would bring a blush to your face if read 
by the world. 

NOTES. 

Notes may be considered as differing from letters in being 
more formal, in being generally written in the third person, 
and being without signature. They are used for announce- 
ments, invitations, anniversaries, acceptances, regrets, and 
the like. For weddings, receptions, and other ceremonious 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 5(55 

occasions, your stationer will tell you the prevailing style. 
For acceptances and regrets, which should always be 
promptly made, the following models will suffice. They 
may be varied to suit the occasion and the relations of the 
parties :

NOTES OF INTRODUCTION. 

Notes of introduction should be brief, and contain the 
full name and address of the person introduced. For busi- 
ness purposes they are often used, but the receiver is not

required to entertain the bearer as a friend unless entirely- 
agreeable. The obligation ceases with the transaction of 
the business in hand. A business introduction is delivered 
in person. The envelope containing it should not be sealed, 
and on its left-hand lower cbrner should be written the 

words, " Introducing Mr. ," that its character may 

command immediate attention. No pecuniary obligation is 
incurred by such an introduction, unless particularly men- 
tioned. The conventional form is more or less as follows :

Introductions, should only be given when there is perfect 
confidence felt in the party introduced. It is right to refuse 
such a favor, if thought best, merely on the ground of un- 
willingness to take the liberty of presenting any one to the 
person or firm to whom introduction is asked. 

A social introduction should be given with great caution. 
The writer should be well acquainted with both parties. Be 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 567 

specially careful in making introductions to ladies. It is an 
insult to the whole sex if you present to a lady any person 
of doubtfal reputation. Never give letters of introduction, 
unless you are prepared to be responsible for the persons to 
whom they are given. Why should you thrust upon the 
society of a friend those whom you would not admit to your 
own ? Or why ask his good services for individuals whom 
you know do not deserve them ? 

In all such letters candor should prevail. Say what you 
mean. Do not use ambiguous terms which leave a pleasant 
impression on the reader, but awaken a measure of confi- 
dence and generous purpose beyond what you intended. 
Whatever object is proposed in giving the letter should be 
distinctly stated, even though it be that you give it simply 
to rid yourself of a bore. If you know nothing of a party, 
but desire to get him employment, or some such favor, 
state the facts, though you defeat the purpose. 

The holder of a social letter of introduction should not 
take it in person, but should send it with his card of address. 
The receiver, if he be a gentleman, will call upon you with- 
out delay. At all events, you are bound to give him an 
option ; whereas, by taking your letter in person you force 
yourself upon him, whether he will or not. Should the 
letter introduce a gentleman to a lady, she may, at her op- 
tion, answer by a note of invitation — appointing a time for 
him to call. 

All polite deportment is based upon common sense. It 
is not the prerogative of the privileged and favored few, but 
it is the right and the duty of all. Not one of its require- 
ments is useless if the comfort and welfare of our friends and 
associates be properly considered. The springs of politeness 
must be within. If one has learned to correct personal 
faults, to control self, and to be regardful of others, he has 
gone a long way toward that refinement of nature which 
will make him everywhere a welcome and honored guest

If in the sanctity of home he lives in obedience to these prin- 
ciples, he will not be likely to ignore them when in the society 
of others ; and when in public places or engaged in corres- 
pondence, it will be as natural for him to be well-mannered 
and self-poised as it is for the thriving plant to drink in the 
morning dew. If it is worth while to have keen enjoyment 
of life — to win and to retain friends, and to make society 
better by our correct life in the midst of it — ^then it is no loss 
of time, but a gain in every direction, to understand and

Care of Children. 



By W. B. Atkinson, M. D., Lecturer on Diseases of 
Children, Jefferson Medical College, Phila. 



FROM the moment of birth it should be remembered 
that the infant is a being of feeble powers ; that while 
it possesses a wonderful vitality, yet that vitality is 
readily extinguished or impaired. Such impairment often 
remains through life, rendering it a delicate, or perhaps 
deformed, creature, liable to succumb to the most trivial 
attacks of disease. 

HEREDITARY INFLUENCES. 

Whereas the child born of healthy parents, and that has 
been reared under proper surroundings, is prepared to resist 
the usual diseases of child-life, and if it is attacked, rarely 
fails to have a mild form, from which it recovers perfectly. 
For instance, the child of scrofulous, or otherwise diseased 
parents, when exposed to scarlet fever usually has a bad 
form of the disease and recovers imperfectly, being left with 
running from the ears, or even deafness, or other of the 
common results of this disease. Even where the parentage 
of a child is tainted much may be done to make it better in 
health and less liable to continue the taint in its own person, ' 
and subsequently to transmit it in time to its offspring. 



5Y2 ^^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

FIRST CARE OF A CHILD. 

At the outset let it be understood that the so-called 
hardening of an infant by exposure, by cold bathing, by a 
prescribed diet, and other such plans is not only a failure, 
but frequently itself is the cause of the beginning of disease 
in an otherwise healthy infant. A new-born child, coming 
as it does from a position in which the temperature has been 
never less than that of the human body internally (98.5 °F.), 
is extremely liable, especially in cold weather, to lose its 
vital heat. Hence, it should not be washed in cold water, 
or, in fact, for the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours, in 
water at all. The best method is to cleanse its surface by 
rubbing the skin with pure, fresh lard or sweet oil. This 
unites readily with the cheesy matter usually found to a 
greater or less extent on the skin of a new-born child ; then, 
with a dry, soft cotton cloth the whole surface is readily 
cleansed. Where blood or other stain still adheres, the 
cloth may be moistened with warm water, and thus the sur- 
face is thoroughly cleansed. The use of water, and particu- 
larly of soap, is objectionable for several reasons. 

Soap — as often found in the sick-room — is made of impure 
fats, which often have a poisonous effect, or it may have an 
excess of alkali, either of which conditions is injurious to 
the delicate cutaneous surface of the child. Again, the 
soapy water usually gets into the child's eyes, resulting in 
more or less inflammation of these delicate organs. Wash- 
ing, unless when performed in a gentle manner, removes 
more or less thoroughly the natural oil of the skin, causing 
chafing, and also giving rise to many forms of eruption so 
often seen in the young infant. At all times the surface 
should be cleansed with care and gentleness. When soap 
becomes absolutely necessary in order to remove dirt, it 
should be of the best quality and used sparingly. The 
temperature of the water should be about that of the blood 
~-say 95° — and the child not too long exposed in cool 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 573 

weather, lest its surface be chilled and a congestion of some 
of the internal organs occur. Bathing is always valuable, 
not only for the purposes of cleanliness, but also to keep 
the numerous pores of the skin in a condition to do their 
work. The water should be sufficiently warm to prevent 
the child suffering a chill, and the bath must be given in a 
situation not exposed to a draught, the whole surface to be 
rubbed dry with a soft towel. 

SUITABLE CLOTHING. 

The clothing for the very young child should be loose — 
tied rather than pinned — and in cold v/eather should com- 
pletely cover its body up well around the neck, the arms 
to the wrists, and the legs and feet. Much damage is done 
by the foolish habit of exposing children in cool or cold 
weather — even in the house-^with short sleeves, low-necked 
dress, and legs bare above the knees. It must be borne in 
mind that the blood in the extremities is readily chilled, and 
by this means cholera-infantum and dysentery in summer, 
and the colds and other affections of winter, are brought on. 
In hot weather a young child may usually be allowed to lie 
on a blanket or comfortable on the floor, unencumbered 
with much clothing, a light, soft slip being all that is 
required, and the only care being to avoid a draught. Here 
it can roll in every direction and move every muscle without 
hindrance. 

While upon the subject of the child's clothing we may 
properly urge the importance of keeping the child outside 
the bonds imposed by fashion as long as, it is possible. 
Have everything to fit easily and loosely ; give it free scope 
for every movement, that motion may be a pleasure, not a 
pain. Especially see that the foot — usually so perfect and 
handsome at birth — is not confined, cramped in a shoe too 
narrow, and, almost invariably, too short for it. This point 
is one of the greatest value^ as children grow so rapidly that 



574 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBS AS Y. 

frequently we find a shoe but little worn has already become 
too short. Here economy urges many to do a great wrong, 
for the use of a shoe too short for the foot compels nature, 
in its efforts to find room for the lengthening toes, to bend 
them over each other, and thus is produced that hideous 
and laming deformity — a foot with enlarged joints, with 
bunions, and with overlapping toes. Such a foot becomes 
a constant source of misery to its owner who is compelled 
to walk much. Even in hot weather it is safer for a child 
to wear next to its skin a soft merino shirt. The infant 
should wear its flannel band, covering its body from the 
armpits to the groins, until it is able to run about. This 
needs to be applied neatly and carefully, or it becomes a 
mere girdle about the middle of the child. In warm weather 
this band should be made of soft, light flannel, which may 
be made somewhat heavier as the cool weather of fall 
approaches." 

The special value of this band is that it prevents chilling 
of the bowels, almost always the cause of cholera-infantum 
and other bowel affections. As the child becomes older — 
particularly in girls — must we urge the necessity of the 
avoidance of tight bands around the waist by which the 
skirts are supported, dragging constantly on the hips, com- 
pressing the abdomen, and thus forcing the internal organs 
out of their places. The wonderful prevalence of backache, 
sense of weariness after the shortest walk, and a host of ills 
in our female patients, may undoubtedly be traced to this 
as the commencement — aided, subsequently, by immense 
loads of skirts, late hours, neglect of the proper care, and 
the usual habits incident to fashionable life. Nor must we 
forget the support of the stockings. Garters are a constant 
injury, as they are generally worn. They compress the 
entire limb and markedly interfere with the circulation of 
the blood. Many cases of varicose veins are wholly due to 
this habit. 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 575 

SUITABLE FOOD. 

The food of the child from the outset must be either that 
provided by nature, the mother's milk, or something as 
nearly approaching it as may be. The young mother, the 
nurse — all, should be cautioned never to feed the child with 
anything at birth. It should be well understood that this 
is best for several reasons. All such trash as sugar or 
molasses and water, or any of the many abominations usually 
given to the new-born child with the erroneous belief that 
it must be hungry, and hence requires food, tends to cause 
indigestion, and produces wind in the stomach and bowels. 
This induces the child to cry with pain, and it is either fed 
with more of the stuff, under the belief that it is still hungry, 
or, worse, it is dosed with " soothing drops " to relieve its 
pain, and a new source of injury is added. Let me say here 
that no drops, cordials, sirups, or anything in the shape of 
drugs should be given, especially to a young child, without 
the advice of a physician. On this subject we shall speak 
more fully subsequently. 

Let us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the mother 
has a good flow of milk and the child nurses well. It is 
necessary that she should endeavor to so form its habits 
that it shall at first take the breast about once in every two 
hours, or a little longer, during the day, and about once in 
four to six hours at night. The child is greatly the crea- 
ture of habit, and where the mother begins to put it to the 
breast at every cry, or whenever it rouses, it speedily 
acquires the custom of demanding the breast constantly. 
Indeed, some mothers will lie at night^ with the infant on the 
arm, so that it virtually sleeps with the nipple in its mouth. 
In such cases the child refuses to submit to any other plan 
and becomes a constant annoyance until it is weaned. As 
it becomes older, the interval between the nursings should 
be lengthened, so that it is suckled once in four to six hours 
and at night generally will go without till the hour for 



576 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

rising has come. The food should be wholly the breast- 
milk or its equivalent until the child has advanced so far 
with its teeth as to be fully able to chew the food thoroughly. 
Nor even then need much change be made ; for long after 
weaning the best food is that into which milk largely enters. 
Too much of a variety is hurtful to a young child. As 
children grow, or should grow, rapidly, and require frequent 
supplies to make up for the wear of, as well as the increase 
in, the body, they should always be supplied with good, 
nourishing food whenever they express a feeling of hunger. 
It is not well to endeavor to restrict such to the exact num- 
ber and hours for meals, as in adult life. 

VALUE OF SUNSHINE. 

Not less important is an abundance of sunlight and fresh 
air. The effects upon plant life of the absence of sunlight 
is shown by the plant growing thin, pale, delicate ; in fact, 
this is made use of by gardeners to procure tender white 
stalks, as of celery, etc. Abundance of illustrations will 
readily occur to the thoughtful of the vicious effects of a 
want of sunlight. This is one of the most valuable results 
accruing by the transfer of an invalid to the sea-shore, the 
mountains, or to the country farm. We may contrast the 
pale, delicate appearance of those members of an otherwise 
healthy family who are compelled to remain all day long, 
and day after day, in the small house shut in from the sun's 
rays by its overshadowing neighbors, with those whose 
occupation compels them to be abroad. 

Of course, the author would not be understood as advising 
exposure to the direct, fierce rays of the sun in midsum- 
mer. It is its light, rather than its excess of heat, that does 
the good, that increases the vitality of the little one. That 
this does not seem by a great number of people to be re- 
garded as of value is shown by their utter neglect of it, in 
permitting windows to be blocked up by furniture, old hats, 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 577 

clothing, and even dirt. Here cleanliness acts in more ways 
than might at first be anticipated. Therefore, make the 
nursery a light, cheerful room. Use only sufficient curtains 
to prevent the direct rays from being an annoyance. Cur- 
tains should be such as can readily be removed, and so dis- 
posed as to afford the smallest opportunity for the accumu- 
lation of dust; for where such accumulation occurs is 
most likely to be the nest for a deposit of disease germs. 

GOOD VENTILATION. 

Full and free ventilation must always form a part of the 
means by which we prevent disease, as well as fight it after 
it has entered. Like sunligh^ fresh air is a most valuable 
factor in health, and its deprivation equally one in disease. 
The air of every part of a house should be thoroughly 
changed so soon as the inmates rise in the morning and 
throw open the dwelling. The bed-room windows, save in 
extremely cold or wet weather, should be widely opened, 
and so remain till near nightfall. The living, or work-rooms, 
should equally be cared for. In the sick-room or nursery 
the air can be readily changed from time to time by pro- 
tecting the inmates from the draught. Cover the child, 
head and all, in cold weather, and open the doors and win- 
dows to their fullest extent for a few minutes. Where the 
air does not enter freely and drive out that which is vitiated, 
thorough ventilation may be obtained by swinging the door 
to and fro, shaking the curtains, or some similar plan. For- 
tunately, we find the fresh air from the unlimited reservoir 
without is ready to enter and drive out the disease-laden 
air of the room. At the same time, it must be understood 
that cold air is not always pure air. The fire may be main- 
tained while this is going on, so that the temperature is not 
lowered beyond the degree of comfort. Now that ther- 
mometers of a good quality can be obtained so cheaply, 
every sick-room at least should have one as an indispensa- 



578 TffE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

ble article of furniture. By its readings, the temperature 
should be carefully observed, so that a moderate and even 
degree of heat can be secured. 

While we enforce the importance of pure air to children, 
it becomes an imperative duty to allude strongly to the 
vitiation of the air. While in the streets of a large city, 
and even in other localities, circumstances often greatly in« 
terfere with our efforts in this behalf, yet we constantly sfee 
an unnecessary, even criminal, carelessness in such matters. 
The dejections of all kinds are frequently permitted to re- 
main in the rooms during the greater part of the day. 
When possible, especially in cases of contagious diseases, 
these should not only be removed at once, but disinfectants 
should be mixed with them, thus aiding greatly in prevent- 
ing the spread of disease. A great cause of impure air is 
the constant use of tobacco in the house. To all whose 
sensibility of smell is not blunted by their habits, the stale 
fumes of tobacco adhering to the clothes, the curtains, the 
furniture, are disagreeable. We may be regarded as speak- 
ing strongly on this point, but during an experience, largely 
among children, for over thirty years, we can recall numer- 
ous cases of the use of tobacco by the bedside, and actually 
in the faces, of sick and dying children ; of many instances 
of sudden illness in infants brought on by the inhalation of 
tobacco smoke. A little care and thoughtfulness aids 
greatly in keeping the air of a house pure. Thus, never let 
a poultice, a mustard, or other application remain in the 
room. Air the rooms well after cooking, after meals, after 
the exit of a filthy person. In short, when one enters a 
room from the outer fresh air and detects a strange odor 
there, such a room should be thoroughly ventilated as soon 
as possible. Warmth, not only by clothing, but by heat, as 
from a fire, is imperatively demanded for children in cold 
and damp weather. The child that expresses a sens'e of 
chilliness, that shivers, is sick or on the verge of sickness. 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 570 



TREATMENT OF AILINGS. 
When the child appears in any way to be " out of sorts " 
do not rush at once to drugs. Remember, that in many in- 
stances a calm, refreshing sleep, a few hours of rest, will 
find an apparently very sick child again playing with its 
toys and as happy as though nothing had occurred. All 
are too much in the habit of accepting the gratuitous advice 
of those around them — advice from those who possess not 
the slightest knowledge of medicine. Let it be a fixed rule 
never to give any medicine without the advice of a skilled 
physician. See what can be done by sanitary regulations, 
by removing the causes of disease, by change of locality. 
Constantly are young children made ill by bad air, bad or 
deficient food, and bad drinks. In this connection, for the 
sake of the over-anxious parents who often wildly aban- 
don hope at the slightest sign of disease, and regard the 
child as doomed to die at the outset, we would say that the 
strong power constantly shown in a child by which, it throws 
off an attack of disease and recuperates its exhausted 
powers, often seems as though the result of miraculous in- 
tervention. Hence, when sickness appears, no matter how 
terrible its form, however doubtful may appear the result, 
preserve to the end courage and cheerfulness. These aid 
constantly in obtaining the wished-for relief The nursing 
is performed faithfully, the child is not dispirited — in short, 
you thus avoid that injurious condition where, hope being 
banished from the outset, it would seem as though the first 
sign of fllness were equivalent to a funeral notice and only 
the forms had to be complied with. A woman who is nurs- 
ing a child should always remember that her milk is ex- 
tremely liable to be rendered injurious to her infant by 
what might seem to her to be but trifling matters. She 
gives way to her temper, her grief; she exhausts herself by 
labor ; she indulges in improper food, and the next act of

suckling is sure to be followed by disorder in some way of 
the child's system. 

The author has seen in his own practice several nriarked 
instances of convulsions in the infant to follow immediately 
after it had begun to draw the milk from the breast of its 
mother who had just been having a scolding match with a 
neighbor. In one instance, the mother had been engaged 
in washing clothing for several hours, during which time the 
infant had not been allowed any nourishment. Finally, 
having completed her task, she sat down, greatly wearied, 
to nurse the child. Almost as soon as the first of the milk 
had entered its stomach, it fell into a profound stupor, from 
which it was with great difficulty aroused. There are 
other points in connection with the matter of nursing of 
equal, perhaps greater, importance, but their consideration 
does not belong to a volume like this. 

EAD HABITS. 

From the earliest hours the mother should esteem it a 
privilege as well as a duty to guard her child by the utmost 
vigilance from the acquiring of bad habits. Any habit in 
the child becomes so rooted — so much a part of its exist- 
ence — that in after years it is virtually impossible to abolish 
it. We need not specify such habits, for many, if not all, 
are well known to parents, and often much deplored. It 
behooves the parent, however, not to err, and punish a child 
for the symptoms of disease under the belief that it is a bad 
habit. One such matter, in particular, requires our special 
attention. This, while a subject of peculiar delicacy, yet is 
of so great importance that we feel we will readily be ex- 
cused for intruding it in a work of this kind. It is the 
incontinence of urine, especially at night. Constantly do 
we find children punished for this occurrence under the 
belief that it is a carelessness — a bad habit into which they 
have fallen. On the contrary, almost invariably the child 



CARE OF CHrLDREN. 531 

is a double sufferer, and very unjustly so. It suffers from 
the punishment and suffers from the act, which causes a 
most unpleasant condition until its clothing is changed. 

Again : by many people who recognize that this is really a 
diseased condition it is regarded as incurable, and hence 
nothing is done' for its relief. When a child is afflicted in 
this way, the parent should at once consult a physician and 
persevere until the child is permanently cured. I say per- 
manently, because in so many of these troubles of childhood 
improvement is temporary and requires persistent treatment. 
When, after such improvement, a relapse occurs, the parents 
are too apt to abandon all effort, with the belief that the 
disease is incurable. We often find that children who are 
troubled with this affliction are in the habit of screaming 
out at night, springing from the bed as if in great fear, or 
burying the head in the clothing, as though to protect them- 
selves from danger. This is an affection known as " Night 
Terrors," and, as in the previous one, the child is constantly 
punished for so doing. Such treatment is not only very 
unjust, but extremely injudicious. When a child presents 
such symptoms it is out of health and imperatively demands 
medical care. An additional reason may be given in the 
fact that such a condition is very apt to be but the forerunner 
or premonitory symptom of loss of mind. Now that we 
know so well that insanity in many of its forms is but the 
expression of a disease which is constantly greatly relieved, 
and often permanently cured, it is well to be warned in time, 
and by early treatment prevent the full access of such 

disease. 

HORRIBLE STORIES. 

Scrupulously guard the child against the silly and horri- 
ble stories so frequently told them by nurses and others. 
In all children, especially those of a nervous temperament, 
who are awakened at night, the recollection of these things 
comes to them with terrible force amid the darkness and 
07

the loneliness, and it is enough to drive the child into a 
temporary, if not lasting, insanity. When such an attack 
occurs, always soothe the little one by every endearment, 
keep the light burning, and remain with it until it has been 
composed again to sleep. It is safer in such cases to have 
a light constantly burning, and when possible an attendant 
should be near, that, when aroused, it may at once feel a 
sense of protection. 

To prevent a return of tnese terrors, the general health 
should be cared for. See that the child has an abundance 
of out-door exercise. Exercise itself is a valuable means 
conducive of sleep in children. The child that has played 
in the open air all day long goes to sleep wearied, but with 
a sense of happiness as it falls into a sound, refreshing slum- 
ber, and, unless disturbed, usually sleeps the entire night 
and wakes refreshed for a new day's work. A special point 
in this connection is that every care should be observed not 
to disturb the sleep of a child. Much harm is constantly 
being done by carelessness in this respect. Another cause of 
harm is overwork of the brain, on which point we will 
speak hereafter. In addition, a child may suffer from such 
attacks as the result of indigestion, or of being indulged in 
too much food just before retiring. In all such cases it 
behooves the parent to remove all causes which may be 
supposed to incite to an attack, and should they continue, 
at once to consult a careful physician. 

SOOTHING SIRUPS. 

In a previous paragraph we alluded to " soothing sirups " 
and articles of a like nature, of which the name is legion. 
All such are useless and dangerous. It is safest and best 
to give no medicine to a child without the advice of a phy- 
sician. When, however, it would appear necessary to resort 
to such means, no article should be used of which the com- 
ponent parts are not fully known. Despite the assurances 



CARE OP children: 583 

so freely given that this or that remedy contains nothing 
that is hurtful, we are constantly being deceived. The 
most hurtful and powerful drugs are usually the basis of all 
these nostrums, and which educated physicians would hesi- 
tate to employ for infants, except under great necessity and 
with the utmost precaution. The effect is generally to lull 
the symptoms for the time, while the cause is insidiously 
undermining the child's health, and finally the little one 
gets beyond the reach of the aid which, too late, is sum- 
moned to it. Again, the child speedily becomes accustomed 
to such articles, and requires their continuance and in in- 
creased doses. The least evil result is indigestion, followed 
by constipation, stunted growth, enfeebled intellect, and 
generally producing such a condition of impairment of 
vitality that the child readily yields to the most ordinary 
attack of disease, and death ends the lesson. 

TEETHING. 
The period for the appearance of the second or perma- 
nent set of teeth is rarely one when there need be any fear of 
disease. But it is very important that the parents should 
observe carefully that these teeth are cut regularly and are 
not interfered with by the temporary ones. Should they 
show signs of irregularity or of a tendency to decay, do not 
delay, but at once consult a skilled physician or dentist, 
that the trouble may be known and obviated. 

EARLY SCHOOLING. 

The question of the education of a child should always be 
one demanding careful consideration. While we are met 
on every hand by infant prodigies — children of wonderful 
precocity — yet it should be borne in mind that this is not 
according to the dictates of nature or of common sense. 
The hours of infancy and early childhood should be devoted 
to the accumulation of a fund of health, which in due time 



Sg4 THE HOUSkWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

will enable its possessor to master, not only attacks of 
disease, but at the proper time to master the most difficult 
problems. These hours should be the happiest of life — free 
from cares or tasks, and particularly free from that irksome 
confinement to the hard benches of a school-room. " Seven* 
years a baby." This is always true, and never more so than 
in regard to education. It is time enough after a child has 
reached and passed that era for it to commence the serious 
business of attending school. We would urge that, except 
in the most easy and pleasant manner possible, no positive 
efforts should be made in the line of what is known as edu- 
cation. 

Certainly, a healthy child is always learning, and little 
by little, with proper care, with scarcely an effort it 
acquires a valuable fund of knowledge during these early 
years. But there should be as few set tasks as possible, no 
memorizing of dates, or of long strings of verses or questions. 
Rather, in these days, the beautiful, the happy method of 
the Kindergarten. Especially during the bright, warm 
days of summer should all confinement to the house be 
avoided. The school must be in the open air, wherever 
it can best be obtained, learning from nature's ever-open 
book. In this connection the evil results of overwork of 
the brain must constantly be borne in mind. Thus are 
often planted the seeds of disease, which too soon yield an 
abundant crop and a harvest of consumption, insanity, and 
the like. Chorea, or St. Vitus' dance, as it is commonly 
called, is frequently brought on by overwork of the brain, 
and even cases are known where an intellect exceptionally 
brilliant at the outset has in a few years been clouded by 
idiocy. 

A common belief with many is that all our meals should 
be partaken of in silence, and though not hastily, yet with- 
out undue loitering over them. This is a grave error. The 
table hour at all times should be a social one. Parents and 



( CARE OF CHILDREN. 5^5 

children should, when convenient, enjoy their meals together 
and enlivened with pleasant chat. This prevents the bolt- 
ing of food half chewed, and other bad habits, and while the 
younger ones should not be permitted to monopolize, or 
even largely share in, the conversation, yet they should be 
encouraged to habits of attention and respect on these occa- 
sions that will enable them to profit in the future. 

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT. 

As a child increases in years it should increase in 
strength. Here Ve gain by open-air exercise. In the very 
young their very exuberance of spirits prompts, even com- 
pels, them to romp and frolic. They are like young animals 
of all kinds, which we see wildly rushing back and forth in 
the fields, as if utterly unable to keep still. But as a child 
gets older it is too apt (especially is this seen in young 
girls) to be content with quiet play. Here comes in the 
value of light gymnastics. When not carried so far as to 
become a task, it proves extremely useful by bringing into 
play in succession each and every set of muscles. By the 
majority of teachers this exercise is so conducted as to be 
regarded as a pleasant means of health exercise, and only 
so long is it useful. The child that finds light exercise a 
drag requires close attention lest disease be making inroads 
when least expected. Hence a teacher should be watchful 
not to disregard the evident signs which tell of exhaustion, 
and should act accordingly. 

Dancing becomes a means to the same end, but, unfortu- 
nately, it is sadly abused. This is not the place to descant at 
length upon the abuses of dancing, save to warn parents not 
to permit this exercise to be carried so far that it produces 
muscular exhaustion rather than tenacity of the muscles. 
Skating, whether on the ice or on parlor skates, is equally a 
valuable exercise, but always with the same proviso. Re- 
cently we find the addition of lawn tennis, croquet, cricket, 



536 I'H^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

and base ball as incentives to out-door exercise. With all 
of them the constant trouble is to prevent excesses. The 
great desire for victory carries the players forward until 
they have long passed the boundary of benefit and they 
reap an abundant harvest of joints and muscles strained, not 
to say those graver injuries — heart diseases, blood vessels 
ruptured, hernia, and the like. The last game — viz., base 
ball, should be abolished from the list permitted for children. 
It not only demands too much and prolonged exertion, 
very destructive to the growing frame, but its dangers of 
maiming, even killing, its players are so many that it is 
absolutely unsafe both for performers and spectators. 

HOME GOVERNMENT. 

The home of a child from its earliest remembrance 
should be associated with happiness. Health is always the 
handmaid of happiness. A peevish, fretful child not only 
discomforts those around it, but is itself constantly the vic- 
tim of indigestion and the like. Hence it becomes an im- 
portant duty for the parent to begin the moral education of 
a child almost at birth. We constantly see how rapidly 
even an infant becomes the tyrant of the household when 
its slightest whims and humors are permitted and indulged. 
Kindness, but also firmness, are demanded in the treatment 
of children. Decide what is right, what is best, and let 
that decision be final. Make such decisions in no petulant, 
hasty spirit. This only leads to fear, rather than love, and 
perhaps to concealment and deception. 

Above all, as the child grows older and more observant, 
be extremely watchful lest your example lead it astray, 
Remember, a child is ever apt to imitate the actions of those 
with whom it is constantly associated. Regard these little 
ones as your most priceless treasures. Study that you 
may so fashion their homes and their lives that the future 
will reflect no doubtful or evil results.

We know not of what we are capable till the trial comes ; — till it comes, 
perhaps, in a form which makes the strong man quail, and turns the gentlet 
woman into a heroine. Mrs. Jameson. 



Trying Emergencies. 



WHAT TO DO FIRST. 

EMERGENCIES will arise. Accidents will occur ; and 
when they occur the prompt action, if it be wisely 
directed, is that which accomplishes the needed work. 
An alphabetical arrangement of such cases as are most 
common is here given. When an emergency does arise, 
deliberately look for directions in this chapter, and proceed 
as directed, meanwhile seeking a physician. 

Apoplexy. — In apoplexy the patient suddenly falls into a 
state of stupor or unconsciousness, the pupils of the eyes 
are dilated, the breathing laborious or snoring, the swallow- 
ing difficult, the pulse slow and sometimes irregular, with 
loss of power in the limbs, and usually a deeply flushed 
face. Do not mistake this for intoxication. In such a case 
elevate the head and body, loosen the clothing about the 
neck, place the feet in hot mustard water with mustard over 
the stomach, apply cold to the head and nape of the neck, 
and send at once for a physician. If a doctor cannot be 
obtained quickly, open the bowels by an injection of soap 
and warm water. 

Asthma. — Asthmatic attacks may frequently be cut short 
in several ways. "If the patient be very nervous, let the 
attention be diverted in any way possible and the breathing 
will soon become much easier! - Another method of relief 
may be found in administering an emetic ; still another, in 
smokmg the asthma cigarettes which are sold generally by 

589 



590 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the druggists ; still another, in drinking one or more cups 
of strong coffee; still another, in inhaling steam from a 
basin of hot water into which a tablespoonful of Hoffman's 
anodyne has been poured, and still another, by giying a full 
dose of opium, laudanum, or paregoric. 

Bites of Dogs, Serpents, etc. — Make haste to suck well the 
bit^s of dogs, cats, snakes, and other animals whose bites 
are poisonous, unless the mouth is sore. In the case of 
dogs also bind the limb tightly above the bite and bum the 
wound with a hot iron or needle ; besides, capture the dog, if 
possible, and keep him watched carefully until ascertained 
whether he is mad or not. In the case of snake bite, after 
sucking and burning the wound, give whisky or brandy 
in full doses and keep up the intoxication until the doctor is 
called. 

Bleeding, see Hemorrhages. 

Blisters. — All blisters, whether caused by burns, scalds, 
heat of the sun, Spanish fly, or friction, should be carefully 
opened near one edge without removing the skin, and then 
dressed with sweet oil or some mild ointment like simple 
cerate, cold cream, or cosmoline. 

Broken Bones, see Fractures. 

Bruises. — First cleanse them ; then, until pain is relieved, 
apply cloths wet with cold water, to which laudanum may 
be added. After the pain has subsided, warm water dress- 
ings will hasten the removal of the discoloration, swelling, 
and soreness. 

Black Eye. — This should be treated as any other bruise. 
After the swelling is gone, the dark color may be concealed 
by painting it or by flesh-colored plaster. 

Bums and Scalds. — Dust the parts with bicarbonate of soda, 
or wet with water in .which as much of the soda has been 
placed as can be dissolved. When the burns are so severe 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 59 J 

that the skin broken and blisters are raised, open the blis- 
ters at one side and swathe the parts with soft linen anointed 
with simple cerate or saturated with sweet oil, castor oil, or 
equal parts of linseed oil and limewater. Burns from acids 
should be well washed with water. Burns from caustic 
alkalies, should be well washed with vinegar and water. 
When a person's clothing is on fire he should quickly lie 
down and be wrapped in carpet or something else that will 
smother the flame. 

Chokillg. — If possible, remove the offending substance at 
once with the fingers, or with blunt scissors used as forceps, 
or a loop of small wire bent like a hairpin. It may be pos- 
sible to dislodge it by blowing strongly in the ear, or by 
causing the patient to vomit by tickling the throat. In a 
child these efforts may be aided by holding it up by the 
legs. If pins, needles, or fish bones get in the throat, they 
frequently require great care in attempts at removal. A 
surgeon had better be called as soon as possible if the body 
cannot be dislodged at once, and especially if there be dif- 
ficulty in breathing. 

Cholera Morbus. — This affection often requires that some- , 
thing be done at once. For this purpose, thirty drops of 
laudanum or two or three teaspoonfuls of paregoric may be 
given to an adult, or proportionate doses for children. Also 
apply over the stomach a mustard plaster or cloths wrung 
out of hot water and turpentine, and frequently changed. 
If relief is not soon obtained, seek the advice of a physician. 

Colic. — May be treated as above, with the addition of an 
emetic or purgative, or both, if due to undigested food. 

Convulsions in Children. — When these occur, place the child 

at once in a bath of hot water with mustard added ; apply 

cold water cloths to the head, move the bowels with an in- 

■ jection of warm water or soapsuds, and give enough sirup 

of ipecac to vomit, unless this has already occurred. Con- 



692 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

vulsions frequently indicate the commencement oi* some dis* 
ease ; hence it is well to call a physician early. 

Contusions, see Bruises. 

Croup. — When a child is taken suddenly with the croup 
at night, give at once a teaspoonful of sirup of ipecac, or 
the same with a few drops of antimonial wine added, or a 
teaspoonful of powdered alum followed by a cup of water. 
Repeat these soon if necessary to cause vomiting. Warm 
water cloths may be applied to the throat if covered with 
dry wrappings. Keep the child warm, so that sweating may 
be induced, and strive to allay its excitement or fear. 

Cuts, see Wounds. 

DiarrliOBa. — Diarrhoea is most generally caused by an irri- 
tation of the bowels, due either to the presence of undigested 
food or the remains of a previous constipation. Hence it 
is always well to commence treatment by a dose of castor 
oil, to which may be added ten drops of laudanum. After 
the bowels have been moved, give to an adult ten or fifteen 
drops of laudanum after each subsequent movement, stop* 
ping its use after a few doses. Half-teaspoonfiil doses of- 
ginger in water may be tried. Injections of boiled starch 
with twenty or thirty drops of laudanum may be tried. Give 
but little opium to children. 

Dysentery. — Dysentery may almost certainly be recog- 
nized by the griping and bearing-down feeling when the 
bowels are moved, and especially if the discharges are slimy 
and mixed with blood. 

A physician should be consulted without wasting much 
time in trying the simpler diarrhoea remedies. 

Dislocations. — A dislocation is the displacement of the end 
of a bone at the joint; hence there is a deformity of the 
joint. The ligaments about the joints are necessarily more 
or less torn ; hence there is pain. Most of these dislocations 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 593 

will require the skill of a surgeon ; hence one should be ob- 
tained as early as possible, care being taken to make the 
patient as comfortable as may be by an easy position and 
cooling and soothing applications to the affected joint. 

The following named joints may be easily restored usually 
by the process given : Dislocations of the fingers are reduced 
by pulling in the line of the bones with moderate pressure 
at the affected joint. Retain in place by a small splint loosely 
bound along the back of the finger and hand. 

Dislocation of lower jaw. — Replace this by wrapping the 
two thumbs well with towels, then thrusting them into the 
two sides of the patient's mouth, slipping them over the back 
teeth, at the Scune time grasping firmly, with the fingers, the 
two sides of the jaws outside the mouth, and making pres- 
sure firmly downward and backward with the thumbs, using 
the sides of the jaw as a lever. As soon as the jaw is felt 
to be moving into place, slip the thumbs quickly from off 
the teeth into the sides of the cheeks to prevent having them 
crushed by the teeth, which will be drawn together with 
great force. Afterward, keep the jaw in place by bandag- 
ing, so that the lower teeth will be firmly pressed against 
the upper row. 

Dislocation of shoulder. — ^To reduce this, place the patient 
on his back, sit down close by his side with foot to his 
shoulder, remove the shoe and place the foot in his arm-pit, 
seize the patient's hand and pull firmly, drawing the arm 
somewhat across the body, and making at the same time, 
pressure upward and outward with the foot in the arm-pit. 
If successful, the head of the bone will be heard, or felt, to 
go in place with a snap. If not soon successfiil, stop and 
send for a surgeon. Retain bone in place by bringing the 
forearm across the chest and securing there by sonie kind of 
bandage. 

Drowning. — To prevent drowning. — When upset in a boat 



594 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

or thrown into the water and unable to swim, draw the 
breath in well ; keep the mouth tight shut; do not struggle 
and throw the arms up, but yield quietly to the water ; hold 
the head well up, and stretch out the hands only below \h& 
water ; to throw the hands or feet up will pitch the body 
below the water, hands or feet up will pitch the body head 
down, and cause the whole person to go immediately under 
water. Keep the head above, and everything else under 
water. 

To restore the apparently drowned. — As soon as removed 
from the water, treat the patient instantly on the spot with- 
out wasting precious time in removing to a house, unless 
the weather is intensely cold. Free the neck, chest, and 
waist of clothing. Place the patient on his face with a 
cushion under his chest and his arm under his forehead, anxi 
make pressure on the back for a moment to force water from 
the lungs. Clear the mouth with the finger and prevent the 
tongue from obstructing the windpipe by bringing it well for- 
ward, and securing it there by passing a cord well back over 
its base, bringing the ends out at the corners of the mouth 
and tying them under the chin. Then turn the patient on 
the back, with a cushion under the shoulders so as to carry 
the chin away from the chest and thus extend the neck. 
Then seek to restore respiration in the following manner, 
which is generally known as Sylvester's method : place your- 
self behind the patient's head, seize the arms near the elbows 
and sweep them around away from the body and bring them 
together above the head, at the same time giving them a 
strong pull for a few seconds. This elevates the ribs, en- 
larges the chest, and thus fills the lungs with air. Next 
return the arms to their former position beside the chest 
and make strong pressure against the lower ribs for a 
moment so as to drive out the air again from the lungs. 
Repeat this manoeuvre about fifteen or sixteen times a 
minute, and keep it up for a long time, unless natuial 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 595 

respiration is secured in the meantime, or it has been estab- 
lished beyond a doubt that the patient is certainly dead. 

When the patient begins to breathe, stimulate this by the 
use of ammonia applied to the nose, by slapping briskly the 
surface of the body, by dashing water upon the chest or face, 
and by suiting the artificial to the movement of the natural 
as nearly as possible. Let some person also commence rub- 
bing the limbs briskly upward so as to aid the feeble circu- 
lation ; and secure warmth to the body by warm blankets, 
warm bricks, bottles of warm water (or anything else that 
will retain heat), applied to the armpits, over the stomach, 
and elsewhere about the body. Let some stimulant be 
given as soon as it can be swallowed, and repeated occa- 
sionally until danger is over. 

Never attempt to move the patient until fully restored if 
you can possibly avoid it. Then he should be carefully 
placed in a warm bed and watched to see that breathing 
does not suddenly cease. Should this occur, renew the ar- 
tificial respiration at once. 

Ear {Foreign bodies hi). — If a living insect is in the ear, 
turn the head to the opposite side and fill the ear with tepid 
water, oil, or glycerine, and it will soon come to the surface. 

A bright light thrown into the ear will also often suc- 
ceed in bringing it out. Any body that will not swell when 
moistened with water may probably be removed by syring- 
ing the ear thoroughly, with the face held downward. 

None but the very gentlest probing of the ear should be 
attempted by any one but a physician, who understands 
what a delicate organ he has to deal with. 

Earache. — Earaches frequently are caused by diseased 
teeth. In such cases the quickest remedy is either the 
extraction of the sinning tooth or the adoption of treatment 
appropriate for the toothache. Earaches not caused by the 
teeth may often be relieved by using hot drinks, and a hot 



596 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

hop poultice over the affected ear. A persistent earache 
most likely indicates some disease of the ear and should 
always lead to consulting a doctor. 

Epileptic RtB. — These are known by pallor of face at first, 
a peculiar cry, loss of consciousness, then flushing of face 
and violent convulsions, with foaming at the mouth, rolling 
of the eyes, and biting of the lips and tongue. 

In a fit of this kind, place the patient on the back, with 
little or no elevation of the head ; control his movements only 
so far as to prevent injury ; place a folded towel between the 
teeth, if possible, to prevent the biting of the tongue. 

When the convulsion is over, let the patient rest in some 
quiet place, having previously taken a slight stimulant if very 
much exhausted by the violence or length of the fit. 

Eye {Foreign bodies in). — Dirt in the eye may be washed 
out by squeezing from a sponge a small stream of tepid 
water. To wash lime from the eye, use the tepid water mod- 
erately acidulated with vinegar or lemon-juice. Cinders 
and other small particles may be removed generally by 
touching them with a soft silk or linen handkerchief twisted 
to a point, or by using a loop of human hair. Metallic par- 
ticles can often be removed best by the use of a magnet. 

To expose the eye more fully, the upper lid may be easily 
everted by lifting it by the lashes and pressing from above 
by a slender pencil or stick. 

Painting. — When persons have fainted lay them down 
with the head as low as possible, loosen the clothing, keep 
back any crowding that would interfere with plenty of fresh 
air; sprinkle water over the face, apply hartshorn to the 
nose, and if too long in recovering consciousness, place 
heated cloths or plates over the stomach. 

Fits in Children, see Convulsions.

Fish-hooks. — When a fish-hook has entered any part of the 
body, cut off the line, file off the flattened end, and pass 
the hook on through the flesh like you would a needle in 
sewing. 

Fraxstures. — Broken bones are easily recognized by the 
grating of the ends on each other, by the unusual bending 
of the limb, and by the pain caused by motion at this point. 
A fracture is called compound when the end of the bone 
protrudes through the skin. Whenever such protrusion is 
seen, the part should be cleansed and at once covered with 
adhesive plaster or a piece of linen saturated with white 
of egg. All fractures should be attended to by a surgeon.j 
consequently the dressings suggested here are only tem- 
porary, and intended to protect the parts from further 
injury. 

In fracture of the arm above the elbow, bandage the 
upper arm to the side of the chest, and place the hand in a 
sling. 

In fracture of tlie arm below the elbow, bend the arm at 
the elbow at a right angle, place the thumb uppermost, and 
bandage it between two padded splints, reaching from elbow 
to ends of the fingers, one being placed on the back of 
the arm and the other on the front, and place the hand in a 
sling. 

In fracture of the leg below the knee, extend the leg beside 
the sound one, giving it the same position ; place a pillow 
beneath from the knee down, fold the sides of the pillow 
over the leg, and secure it in that position by bandages. 

In fracture of the thigh-bone, place the patient on the back 
in bed, relax the muscles of the leg by drawing the feet up 
toward the body sufficiently, bind splints to the outer and 
inner side of the broken thigh ; then bind both legs together, 
and turn patient on the side with the injured limb upper- 
most.

In fracture of the knee-cap, bind the whole limb to a 
splint on the back of it, being careful to place a sufficiently 
large pad beneath the bend of the knee. 

In fracture of the collar-bone, place the patient on his back 
on a hard bed without any pillow. 

In fracture of the lamer jaw, close the mouth and bandage 
so as to keep the two rows of teeth together. 

In fractures of the skull, lay the patient down and apply 
cold, wet cloths to the head. 

In other fractures, place" the patient in the most comforta- 
ble position possible, keep him quiet, and apply cold water 
to prevent swelling. 

For splints, pasteboard, leather, shiagles, or pieces of 
cigar-box*may be used. 

Frostbite. — In frostbite use gentle friction in a warm room, 
using enough cold water or snow to prevent too rapid 
reaction and consequent pain in the affected part. If very 
severe, call a physician, as gangrene may follow. 

Gunshot Wounds, see Wounds. 
Heatstroke, see Sunstroke. 

Hemorrhages. — In hemorrhages from an artery, the blood 
is bright red, and spurts or jets out from a cut. To stop it, 
make compression between the wound and the heart. 

In venous hemorrhage the blood is dark in colpr and 
flows in a steady stream. To stop it, plake compression on 
the side of the wound away from the heart. Hemorrhage 
from the lungs is bright red knd frothy, while that from the 
stomach is of dark Color. 

To make t'lorough compression of a blood-vessel, knot a 
large handke/chief in the middle, piace the knot over the 
line of the vessel, tie the ends iirmly around the limb, thrust 
a short stick beneath, and twist by turning the stick like 
you turti an auger. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. gg^ 

Hemorrhage from the nose may be stopped generally by 
snuffing up the nose salt and water, alum and water, or vin- 
egar, or by applying ice between the shoulders or at the 
back of the neck. Keep head raised. 

In hemorrhage from the lungs, place the patient in a sit- 
ting posture in bed, giving teaspoonful doses of salt and 
vinegar every fifteen minutes, and apply ice or cold water to 
the chest, unless the patient is too weak to bear it. 

In hetnorrhage from the stomach, broken ice may be swal- 
lowed with teaspoonful doses of vinegar. 

In hemorrhage from the bowels, use ice-water injections 
and ice over the abdomen. 

L^nries to the Brain. — Blows or falls upon the head are lia- 
ble to injure the brain in two ways. 

Concussion of the brain is recognized by the sickness, faint- 
ness, pallor, depression, and confusion of the patient, and is 
best treated by placing the patient on his back in a quiet, cool 
place, loosening the clothing, and applying heat to the body 
and limbs if they be clammy or cold. 

Compression of the brain is due to fracture of the skull, 
generally a portion being depressed. The symptoms and 
treatment about the same as apoplexy. 

Intoxicatioil. — This may be distinguished from apoplexy by 
the absence of paralysis and of insensibilty of the eye-ball, 
and by the smell of liquor on the breath. 

When sure that the patient is intoxicated and not suffer^ 
ing from apoplexy, an emetic may be given, followed by a 
dose of some preparation of ammonia. 

Vinegar is a very good thing to sober a drunken person. 

Insect Stings, see Stings. 

Ivy Poisoning. — ^Treated by fhe application of cloths satu- 
rated, with sugar-of-lead water or with a solution of bicar- 
bonate of soda in Water. 



600 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBKkRY. 

Lightning Stroke. — Treat with rest and stimulants and 
warmth applied to the body. 

Nausea and Vomiting. — First cleanse the stomach by giving 
large draughts of warm water, and then give small pieces of 
ice, a teaspoonful of lime-water, or a half teaspoonful of aro- 
matic spirits of ammonia, or a small quantity of magnesia 
or baking-soda, and, if necessary, place a mustard plaster 
over the pit of the stomach. 

Nervous Attacks, or Shivering Fits;, are treated by hot 
drinks, heat to the surface of the body, mustard or turpen- 
tine over the stomach, and a dose of Hoffman's anodyne or 
tincture of valerian, if at hand. 

Nose [Foreign bodies in). — Children are apt to shove up 
their noses small bodies of different sorts, which may cause 
serious trouble unless soon removed. Their removal may 
often be effected by vigorously blowing the nose or by re- 
peated sneezing, produced by snuff", or by tickling the nose 
with a feather. If these fail, a hair-pin or button-hook may 
be carefully tried. 

Nose-bleed, see Hemorrhages. 

Poisons. — Acids act as irritant poisons, of which the most 
common are sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and oxalic. 

For poisoning by any of these, give large quantities of 
either soda, magnesia, chalk, whitewash, whiting, or plaster. 
Then provoke vomiting, give bland drinks, rest, and stimu- 
lants if required. For oxalic acid the best antidote is lime 
in some form. For carbolic acid, vomiting, large draughts 
of oil or milk, rest, warmth of body, and stimulants. 

For the alkaline poisons — ammonia, soda, potash, or con- 
centrated lye — give vinegar freely ; then provoke vomiting, 
and give bland drinks, followed by rest, and stimulants if 
required. 

For arsenic, Paris green, or Scheele's green, give large quan- 
tities of milk, white of egg, or flour and water ; then vomit; 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. gQl 

then give tablespoonful doses of dialyzed iron, followed by 
a teaspoonful of salt in a cup of water ; vomit again ; give a 
dose of castor-oil, with rest, and stimulants if needed. 

Sugar of lead. — Give Epsom salts, provoke vomiting ; re- 
peat several times ; then give demulcent drinks, followed by 
castor-oil. 

For corrosive sublimate, provoke vomiting, give strong tea 
without milk ; repeat these several times, then give milk and 
raw eggs ; follow with a dose of castor-oil, and stimulato if 
necessary. 

For tartar emetic, use the same treatment as for corrosive 
sublimate. 

For phosphorus (usually from matches), provoke vomiting 
by giving repeatedly five-grain doses of sulphate of copper, 
then give a dose of magnesia, but no oil. 

For lunar caustic, give a strong solution of salt and water 
repeatedly, then vomit. 

For iodine, vomit, give starch dissolved in water freely, 
following with bland drinks. 

For opium, laudanum, morphia, paregoric, and chloral, 
vomit the patient freely and repeatedly, with mustard and 
warm water; then give strong coffee; keep the patient 
roused by brisk slapping of the skin, or by moving about, 
or by the galvanic battery, and use Sylvester's method* of 
keeping up artificial respiration if necessary. 

For strychnine, vomit once or twice, give a purgative, and 
then secure absolute rest in a dark, cool room, free from 
draughts. Large doses of bromide of potash (thirty grains) 
or twenty grains of chloral may be given. 

For toadstool^ or Jamestown {Jimson) weed, produce 
vomiting and follow by stimulants and external application 
of heat. 

For decayed meats and vegetables, empty the stomach, 
then give a dose of castor-oil and some powdered charcoal. 
* See under Drowning, p. 506. 



602 ^^^ HOUSEWIJ-E'i> LIBRARY. 

For all poisons the best general emetic is mustard and 
plenty of warm water, aided, if possible, by the patient's 
finger thrust down the throat. The best stimulant is strong, 
hot tea or coffee, to which may be added the alcohohc 
stimulants. The best bland drinks are milk, beaten raw 
eggs, gum arabic water, or oil. Demulcent drinks are of 
the same general character. They are mucilaginous, and 
so protect the coatings of the stomach from irritants, etc. 

Scalds, see Burns. 

Shocks. — In violent shock, such as results from severe 
injuries, lay the patient down, cover warmly, and if cold, 
apply external heat by using bottles of hot water, hot 
bricks, or hot flannels, etc. If the patient can swallow, 
give stimulants ; if not, give stimulating injections. A mus- 
tard-plaster may be applied to the chest and spine with 
advantage. 

Snake-bites, see Bites. 

Spasms, see Convulsions. 

• Spitting Blood, see Hemorrhages. 

Splinters. — Wood splinters, if not too brittle, may generally 
be extracted by tweezers or forceps by seizing the end and 
pulling steadily and carefully in the direction opposite that 
in which they entered. Nature will soon make them easier 
of extraction by the formation of matter around them. To 
get hold of a splinter under the nail, cut out a V-shaped 
portion of the nail above it and then the end can be seized. 
Splinters of glass unless readily extracted should be left to 
the skill of the surgeon. When a splinter in the eye can- 
not be extracted, bathe in cold water and bandage loosely, 
so as to keep the eye as quiet as possible till the surgeon 
arrives. 

Sprains, — Treat sprains by rest, elevation of the limb, cold, 
moist applications at first, and afterward either cold or warm. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. gQS 

whichever gives the greater degree of comfort. A splint or 
bandage is sometimes useful. 

Stings. — The stings of scorpions, tarantulas, centipedes, 
bees, wasps, hornets, etc., may be treated best by the appli- 
cation of cloths wet in cold water, or wet mud even. The 
application of a litde ammonia or salt and water will gen- 
erally give marked relief. 

Suffocation. — Treat by quick removal to the open air, 
loosen the garments, and apply friction and artificial respira- 
tion if necessary. To escape injury by the heavier gases, as 
carbonic acid gas, the gases of mines, wells, etc., strive to 
keep the head above them. To escape through smoke, 
cover the head with some article of clothing, and seek the 
outlet with the head as near the floor as possible. 

Sunburn. — For sunburn, use equal parts of bicarbonate of 
soda and fresh lard or cosmoline. 

Sunsta'oke. — Treat this by removing the clothing, applying 
ice to the head and arm-pits until the high temperature is 
lowered and consciousness returns, when it should be dis- 
continued until a rising temperature again calls for it. A 
cold bath of iced water may be very beneficial. 

Tootiiaclie. — When due to a hollow tooth, cleanse the 
cavity with a little dry cotton on a probe or large needle, 
and then pack into the cavity a wad of cotton which has 
been dipped in creosote, oil of cloves, or ether. When there 
is no cavity, try bathing the face and gums with some of the 
various anodynes. 

Unconsciousness. — For the recognition of unconsciousness 
due to fainting, injuries of the brain, and intoxication, see 
those subjects. When unconsciousness is due to disease of 
kidneys there will generally be convulsions, also a smell of 
urine and a dropsical swelling about the eyes and legs. 
When there is uncertainty as to the cause of the uncon- 



OOi THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sciousness, lay the patient on his back with the head some- 
what raised; and if there be p^allor and other signs of 
prostration and a cold surface, apply ammonia to the nose, 
with heat externally and hot drinks internally. If there 
be a hot surface, cold should be used externally and in- 
ternally. 

Wounds. — The first important thing to do is to stop the 
hemorrhage according, to the directions given under the 
head of Hemorrhages. Press tightly between the wound 
and heart if the blood is bright red and spurts or jets out; 
but if blood is dark and flows slowly and steadily, make 
pressure beyond the wound or on both sides of it. For 
wounds high up in thearm, press firmly just above and back 
of the middle of the collar-bone ; and for those high up in 
the leg, press over where the artery is found beating in the 
groin. For wounds of the head, apply pad over the wound 
and bandage tightly. 

To temporarily dress incised wounds or clean cuts, bring 
the edges of the cut evenly together and fasten by bandages, 
adhesive plaster, or pieces of linen saturated in white of egg. 
When the chest or abdomen is cut so that the lung or bow- 
els protrude, first cleanse these by gently squeezing over them 
tepid water from a sponge, and then carefully place them 
back very gently with a soft cloth wet in warm water ; if not 
able to replace them with such a cloth, wet with warm water 
and keep it wet until a surgeon arrives. 

Lacerated or torn wounds seldom bleed much. These 
should be carefully cleansed of all foreign substances, the 
parts placed in position as nearly as possible, and then 
treat as bruises with wet cloths sprinkled with laudanum. 

Perforated Wounds, such as may be made with a rusty 
nail, should be enlarged or kept open by the introduction of 
lint, which must be changed three or four times a day, and 
the wound should be kept well cleansed. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 606 

Gunshot Wounds should always have the care of a sur- 
geon. Temporarily let them be treated by cold, wet cloths, 
with the addition of laudanum if required. If there be signs 
of shock, treat according to directions given under that head. 
About the same general directions may be followed in the 
treatment of injuries caused by machinery. It may be ac- 
cepted as a rule, that gunshot wounds, railroad accidents, 
and machinery accidents are worse than they seem to be. 
The shock to the system is also very severe in these cases, 
and is hard to rally from. 

In all emergencies, the poorest thing to do is to lose 
presence of mind and to hesitate when action is needed. 
Be cool, prompt, decided 1 

EMERGENCY BY FIRE. 

Beyond the class of emergencies already discussed, that 
by fire is as imperative as any. There may be dangers of this 
kind where the most pressing duty is flight. One should 
prepare himself for this by cool contemplation of every new 
situation in which he sleeps or tarries — where the probable 
source of danger lies and what is the most available rnethod 
of escape should be in mind before the emergency arises. 

As a rule, however, the party who discovers a fire should 
give an alarm and then run at it — not from it. Many fires 
can be smothered out. Far less water will drown a fire 
than many suppose. A bucket of water applied from a tin 
dipper to the point of greatest peril will do more good than 
a barrel of water promiscuously dashed out. Keep cool 
and put water where it is needed. 

In a smoke-filled apartment lie down and creep on the 
flioor. Tie a wet handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils 
when passing dense smoke. Carry a coil of small but 
strong rope, with knots along it, when you travel. If need- 
ing to escape by it, fasten one end to the bedstead, grasp 



606 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the rope with a towel, and slide down slowly. Do what 
you can for others who may share your peril, keeping your 
presence of mind and assuring others. 

RAILROAD ACCIDENTS. 

These are generally so sudden that no amount of pre- 
caution avails. As a rule for passengers, however, it is best 
never to jump from a train. That involves more danger 
than staying aboard, usually. The aisle of the car and near 
its centre are the safest positions, as a rule. It is bad in col- 
lisions to have the feet entangled with the seats. To mount 
the seat or reach the aisle is generally safer. In any case, 
keep your presence of mind, without shouting or rashness. 
None but a foolhardy person allows his head or arms to 
project from a moving train. 

ACCIDENTS ON ICE. 

In cold climates every winter has its attendant accidents 
upon the ice. Prevention here is better than cure, and pre- 
vention may be had by the little contrivance shown in the 
^^^^^ cut and known as the 

out of the way when not in use or walking in-doors. The 
attachment to the shoe-heel is made by screws. Thus 
equipped, one may walk firmly on the smoothest ice.

Games and Amusements, 



There are some trades that are solitary and exclusive. Authorship is one 
t>{ these ; and perhaps the author is not always a very amusing inmate. But 
the actor in the private play, the clever and ready wit who makes the charade 
lively, the musician, the embroideress, the fortune-teller, . . . and the artistic 
member — these can add to home amusements.

RECREATION is re — creation. It makes a man feel 
new. Time immemorial it has been confessed that " all 
work and no play make Jack a dull boy." ' The same 
law holds in children of the larger growth. The taut bow 
of active manhood must be relaxed at times, or its elasticity 
will certainly be lost. Splendid surroundings cease to 
charm and may become monotonous or positively irk- 
some. The softest couch cannot relieve a mind disturbed. 
For such ills mental panacea is demanded, and this is found 
in games, amusements, entertainments, and the like. 

Any fertile mind can invent something in the nature of a 
game, or can improve upon existing games. Not, probably, 
upon the old standard games, however. Chess, for instance, 
has been studied by the world's master minds, and he is a 
genius indeed who can add anything thereto. But " the 
way we play it," as is so often said, is probably the very 
best way for each special party in the ordinary games, which 
have not been developed to a perfect method. First, as 
pre-eminent for combining healthfulness with pleasure, 
should be considered 

OUT-DOOR GAMES. 

Archeiy. — One of the oldest of games is Archery. Origi- 
nally a means of warfare and the chase, it has survived that 
use and now flourishes as a pastime. Archery organiza- 
tions are venerable in England and popular in America. 

6U9 



giO THE HOUSEWIFE^ S LIBRARY. 

The " York Round " of Archery consists of sevenfy-two 
arrows at one hundred yards, forty-eight arrows at eighty 
yards, and twenty-four arrows at sixty yards. All public 
matches shot in Great Britain by gentlemen are decided 
upon the result of either a single or double York Round. 

The " National Round," shot by the ladies of Great Bri- 
tain at all public meetings, consists of forty-eight arrows at 
sixty yards and twenty-four arrows at fifty yards. Gener- 
ally the prizes are awarded upon the result of a Double 
National Round. 

The " Columbia Round," adopted for this country, con- 
sists of twenty-four arrows at thirty yards, twenty-four 
arrows at forty yards, and twenty-four arrows at fifty yards. 
These distances are well suited to the present state of skill 
and practice among ladies, and the ranges and division of 
arrows will be in great favor for the first year or two. It 
will be then time to consider the matter of extending the 
ranges. 

The points sought in scientific archery are (i) Position ; 

(2) Nocking the arrow, or properly placing it on the string ; , 

(3) Drawing the bow, which must be done to the same dis- 
tance, in the same manner, and in the same time, else irreg- 
ular hitting will result ; (4) Aiming so as to " keep a line " 
and to hit the target ; (5) Loosing the string so that the 
arrow will fly with power and grace. Finger-gloves, touched 
in grease, facilitate the loosing. 

Bows vary in drawing power, those used in the York 
Round averaging about fifty pounds. Arrows are twenty- 
eight inches long, all of the same form, weight, etc. Ar- 
rows are pointed so as to enter the target. A slight blunt- 
ing will vary the flight very materially. Condition of wind 
must be allowed for, as cross winds, or winds toward or 
from the target, all affect the flight. Practice under the in- 
struction of archery manuals and expert marksmen will 
make perfect ; and for pleasant, healthful, out-door exercise 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. Q\l 

in wnich gentlemen and ladies can participate, archery will 
prove second to none. 

Base Ball. — By common consent, Base Ball is our national 
game. It is, however, a game exclusively for boys and 
men. It is in no sense a family game. It is attended with 
so many serious injuries and has been so largely relegated 
to professional clubs that interest of the better sort has 
been withdrawn from it to a great extent. Those interested 
should buy Hutching's Base Ball Manual, which contains 
the rules (of which there are over seventy, and most of them 
have many specifications), the interpretations of rules, de- 
cisions of leagues, record of plays, etc. 

Cricket — This is essentially the national game of England, 
but it is gaining ground in this land. It is played with 
single or double wicket, the latter being the true game. The 
two sides have eleven players each, though a numerical 
allowance is sometimes made for acknowledged superiority 
of players. The in side remains in until all its members but 
one have been put out. The bowler aims to knock down 
the wickets, while the batsman protects them by parrying 
the balls, which are stopped and caught on the field by 
fielders at various points, while the batsman makes his 
" runs," interchanging places with the other batsman. Hoyle 
thus describes the game : 

" We will suppose a party of cricketers turning out for an 
afternoon's sport. Some carry bats, two have cricket balls, 
and several others bear the stumps of which the wickets are 
constructed. They come to the place where the wickets are 
to be set up, or 'tpitched.' It is a level field, and the space 
between the wickets, in particular, is flat as a billiard-table. 
Now the bowlers advance, and under their direction the 
wickets are set up. The distance between the wickets is 
twenty-two yards. The distance between the stumps must 
be a little less than the diameter of the cricket ball, so that 



612 Tim HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the ball cannot pass between the stumps without touching 
them and knocking off the bails or little bits of wood placed 
across the top of the stumps. The companions of the 
bowler are now dispersed about the field in various posi- 
tions. . . . They all labor for the same object — namely, to 
stop the ball when it is struck by the batspian, to catch it 
(if possible) before it reaches the ground after being delivered 
from the bat (in which case the batsman is considered caught 
out, and his inning is over), and to throw the ball up, when 
they have stopped it, to the bowler or wicket-keeper as 
quickly as possible. The bowler's desire is to knock down 
the batsman's wicket, while the batsman's province is to 
defend his wicket by striking away the ball as it is bowled 
toward him. Beyond this, he has to judge what balls it will 
be safe for him to strike hard at and what balls he must 
content himself with blocking, or striking down ; for on the 
number of runs he obtains will depend the share he con- 
tributes to the success of his side." 

For the detailed rules of Cricket, see Hoyle's Gaines. An 
English publication, James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual, 
is full of valuable information. 

Croijuet. — This game is so well known and so generally 
played, that no better service can be rendered than — waiving 
the questions of variety in arrangement and apparatus — to 
give the generally accepted rules for the play. 

THE LAWS OF CROQUET. 

1. At the outset two of the party are chosen chiefs, one for each side. 
These two determine which shall have the first choice of players. Each plays 
a ball from the starting-point, and he who, with one blqjv of the mallet, drives 
his ball nearest the turning-stake wins the first choice. 

2. The chief who has won the first choice of players opens the game. 

3. Each player at starting must place his ball a mallet's length in front of 
the starting-stake and opposite the centre of the first arch. 

4. A player may play in any attitude he chooses, but in striking he must 
use only one hand. 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. 6I3 

5. The ball must be struck with the face of the mallet's head, and the 
stroke must be a distinct blow, and not a push. 

6. The chief who opens the gams is foUovired by the chief of the opposing 
side, and the other players on each side play alternately in accordance with 
the colors marked upon the starting-stake. 

7. If any players play out of his turn, and the error be discovered and 
challenged before another player makes a stroke, the opposing side may either 
compel the delinquent player to replace hii ball in its original position, or they 
may allow it to remain where it was played. But any advantage to himself or 
disadvantage to his opponents, occasioned by misplay, must be immediately 
rectified. 

8. If the adverse side fail to challenge the misplay before another player 
has commenced, no penalty is attached, but the offending party cannot use his 
next turn, having already anticipated it. 

9. Should a player, by mistake or otherwise, use a wrong ball, he must 
suffer the consequences, and not the rightful owner of the ball. If the 
error be discovered and challenged before the turn is completed, the ball must 
be restored to the position it occupied previous to the misplay, and any dam- 
ages sustained by the adverse side by reason of the misplay must be repaired 
and the offending player deprived of his turn. But if the misplay be not chal- 
lenged previous to the next player commencing to play, the game proceeds as 
if no misplay had occurred, and no penalty is attached. 

10. Each player continues to play so long as he makes a count in the 
game ; that is, so long as he drives his ball through the next arch in order, 
strikes the turning-stake in order, or achieves either roquet, croquet, or roquet- 
croquet, or a combination of two or more of these. Failing to accomplish 
either of these, he relinquishes his turn to the next player. (See Law 26.) 

11. The balls must pass through the arches in their regular consecutive 
order and in the proper direction of the course. If a ball be driven through 
an arch out of regular order, or from the wrong side, it does not count any 
more than if it had passed over any other portion of the ground. When a ball 
passes properly through an arch it is said to " make its arch." 

12. A ball makes its arch when it passes through it in its proper consecu- 
tive order, from either of the following causes only : 

I. When it is driven through by a blow from its owner's mallet. 
II. When it passes through from roquet, croquet, roquet-croquet, or 
ricochet. 
III. When it is driven throujh by concussion ; that is, by a blow from 
another ball driven against it by roquet, croquet, roquet-croquet, or 
ricochet. 



gl4 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

13. A ball is Considered to have passed thwugh its arch if it cannot be touched 
by the handle of the mallet when moved from the top to the base of the arch, 
from wire to wire, on the side from which the ball passed. 

14. Should a ball be driven tixAy partially through its arch in the wrong 
direction, it is not in a position to be driven back and through in the right 
direction . 

15. If a player can drive his ball through two arches by one stroke, or pass 
it through an arch and against the turning-stake, he may lay his mallet on the 
spot where his ball stopped, place it in any direction that is most useful to 
him, and put his ball at the end of the mallet. 

16. Striking the turning stake is equivalent to making an arch, subject to 
the same conditions, and" enjoying the same privileges ; with this exceptional 
advantage, the stake may be struck from ^ny direction. (See Laws 12 
and 15.) 

17. When a ball has completed the round and has struck the starting-stake, 
either by a stroke from its owner's mallet or by roquet, roquet-croquet, cro- 
quet, or by concussion, it becomes a dead ball, and must be removed from 
the field. 

18. When a ball has completed an entire round with the exception of 
striking the starting-stake, it becomes a Rover, and may either go out by strik- 
ing the starting-stake, or may continue its play at large all over the field, sub- 
ject to the conditions and limitations hereafter specified. 

19. A Rover may play upon all the balls one after another, but on no one 
ball twice in the same turn. 

20. A Rover must roquet, roquet-croquet, or croquet in order to continue 
his play. 

21. Should a Rover strike the starting-stake, as specified in Law 17, it 
becomes a dead ball, and must be removed from the field. 

22. When one ball strikes another it is a roquet, and this holds good whether 
the ball striking it proceeds direct from a stroke of the mallet, or rebounds 
upon it from a stake, arch, or any other fixed obstacle, or from another ball 
which it has previously struck. 

23. When aball roquets another, it may strike the roqueted ball again without 
any intermediate play, but this does not constitute another roquet. If, how- 
ever, either ball in this second stroke be driven through its proper arch, the 
arch shall be counted as passed, but the playing ball is not entitled to another 
stroke. 

24. A ball having made a roquet, may either croquet, or roquet-croquet the 
loqueted ball, or proceed on its round. 

25. When a ball roquets two or more balls by one blow of the mallet, it 
constitutes what is called a ricochet.

26. A ball terminates its tour of play when, without making an arch or 
striking a turning-stake, it roquets a ball which it has croqueted. (See 
law 10.) 

27. A ball may only croquet that ball upon which it has made a roquet. 

28. A player may croquet any number of balls consecutively ; but he cannot 
croquet the same ball the second time during the same turn without first send- 
ing his own ball through the next arch in order, or hitting the turning-stake. 

29. A player must perceptibly move the ball he croquets. ' 

30. In making ricochet, a player may croquet the first or all of the balls at 
his option, but the order of croquet must be the same as that of ricochet. 

31. If a ball roquet another, and with the same stroke make its arch, it may 
croquet the roqueted ball, or refuse to do so, and again roquet it before mak- 
ing the croquet, or it may proceed to make another arch. 

32. While executm? the croquet, if a ball flinch, the shot is void, and the 
croqueted ball must be replaced in its former position. The croqueting ball 
may then proceed with its turn, but it cannot repeat the croquet just 
missed. 

33. The laws of roquet-croquet are precisely the same as those which govern 
the croquet, and a player may roquet- croquet any ball that has been roqued. 

34. After making roquet, a player may take two chances by roquet-croquet. 

35. Should a ball in its progress over the ground be interrupted by any one. 
the player to whom it belongs may either allow it to remain where it stopped 
after its interruption, or remove it to the point it probably would have reached 
had no interruption occurred. 

36. Should a ball be accidentally displaced, it must be restored to its proper 
position before the game can proceed. 

37. Should an arch or stake lose its upright position from any cajise, it must 
be restored before the play proceeds. 

38. No play is permitted outside the limits of the ground. A ball driven 
beyond the limits must be immediately placed on the ground at the point 
where it crossed the boundary. A ball so placed may be played upon by 
friend or foe. 

39. If one ball roquets another, and either or both balls go beyond the 
bounds, either or both shall be replaced, and the roqueting ball may play on 
the roqued ball the same as if neither had been driven oiT the bounds. 

40. Players on the same side may advise each other upon a stroke, but not 
assist in making it. 

41. The game is finished when all the players on one side have made all 
the arches and struck the two stakes. 

42. The umpire is chosen by the two chiefs. 



QIQ THE HOUSEWIFES LIBRARY. 

43. The decision of the umpire is final. His duties are, to decide when 
balls are fairly struck ; to restore balls to their places which have been 
disturbed by accident ; to decide whether a croqueted ball is moved or not, 
in doubtful cases ; and to settle all other disputed points which may arise 
during the progress of the game. 

Lawn Tennis. — Lawn Tennis is the destined game of the 
future. " How does it compare with croquet ?" was asked 
of an expert in both games. " As a wedding does with a 
funeral," was the answer. 

As in croquet, gentlemen and ladies may play at Tennis ; 
yet in this there is so much of action that for the youthful 
and vigorous it has special charms. 

It should be played on a level, well-cut lawn. Rubber- 
soled shoes should be worn to insure sure footing and pro- 
tect the turf. Sets packed in strong boxes can be had from 
$4.00 to ^35.00 in price. The set contains bats, or racquets ; 
regulation balls, net poles, net thirty-six feet long, boundary 
pegs, lines and runners, mallet, and book of instructions, 
which gives full directions for constructing the court and 
conducting the game. 

The fact that to play the game requires the set, and that 
this always includes the printed rules, makes it unnecessary 
to give rules here. • Suffice it to say that the game consists 
in serving or delivering the ball from the racquet over the 
net from one court or area into another, the opposing party 
returning the ball in similar manner. The game may be 
played by two, three, or four persons. The skill required 
' for correct service, the agility in catching the balls and dex- 
terity in managing them, the opportunity of scoring afforded 
by good play on your own part and by poor play of the an- 
tagonists, combine to make the game very attractive and 
healthful. 

BOARD GAMES. 

Chess. — Chess is unquestionably the chief of board games. 
It is played upon a board containing sixty-four squares, 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. 617 

with two sets of differently colored pieces, or men ; each 
set having sixteen pieces, of which eight are pawns, having 
the same value and moves ; the others, with their special 
value and moves, being for each set a king, a queen, two 
bishops, two knights, and two castles or rooks. Upon this 
game volumes of profound depth have been written, and 
journals are exclusively devoted to its discussion. In the 
brief space here available, so abstruse a game cannot be 
discussed with fullness or even fairness. Those interested 
need a Chess Manual and the instruction of an expert. 

Checkers. — This is an ancient game, a sort of infantile 
Chess, played upon the same board, and using twelve pieces 
for each side, arranging them on alternate squares in the 
three outer rows of the board. The advances are made 
from each side by moves on the diagonal squares, the one 
having the right to move "jumping" any unprotected 
enemy on an adjacent diagonal, so reducing the number of 
his opponent's pieces. When a piece reaches the outer 
row on its opposite side it becomes a " king," privileged to 
move either way. This is " crowned " by placing another 
piece on top of it. The one jumping all his opponents first 
wins the game. The game for a lively spurt may be re- 
versed, the one losing all his pieces first becoming the win- 
ner. This is called " Give Away." 

Backgammon. — This game is played on the inner side of 
the ordinary chess or checker board. It requires fifteen 
checker pieces and a set of dice for each of the two players. 
The board has twenty-four points colored alternately of two 
different colors. The pieces are arranged on eight of the 
points for each side, the position of each set corresponding 
precisely to that of its opponent. Moves are. made as de- 
termined by the throwing of dice, each party advancing his 
men around the board and aiming at two objects; ist, to 
leave no single piece exposed which might be taken up by 



618 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the opponent ; 2d, to catch up any exposed piece of the 
opponent. Pieces can be taken up when they stand alone 
on a point and the move to be made by the other side 
reaches that unprotected piece. The piece so taken up can- 
not resume play until it is re-entered on a point correspond- 
ing in number to one on the dice thrown by its owner. 
When all the pieces of a side have been gathered into the 
final or home table, the player may throw off any of them 
from points corresponding to the dice thrown. If he has 
none to correspond, he must move up the required number 
of points, or, if this cannot be done, he may play off his 
next highest piece or pieces, as may be needed. The party 
first getting all his pieces off wins. If any of the loser's 
pieces are not then in his home table he is gammoned, which 
is equal to two ordinary beats or hits. If the wihner throws 
off all his men before the loser gets his last man to his own 
side of the board, it is a backgammon, equal to three hits. 
The numbers thrown on the dice must be played, unless it 
is impossible by reason of pre-occupancy of points, when 
the throw is lost. If doublets be thrown, the player has four 
moves instead of two. 

Russian Backgammon. — In this game all the men are en- 
tered into the same table according to the throws. Both 
sets follow the same route on the board, neither side moving 
out of the first table till all its men are duly entered, and 
neither throwing off any men until all of his pieces have 
reached the terminal table. This game is longer and far 
more stubborn than the ordinary form. 

Bagatelle. — This is to Billiards as Checkers is to Chess — 
a diminutive member of the same family. He who plays 
the superior game seldom takes interest in the other. It is 
played on a board varying in length to suit the desires of 
purchasers. Cups are set in the board flush with its surface, 
into which ivory balls are driven with a cue, the plays all 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. 619 

being from the opposite end of the board. These cups 
have different values, upon which the count is made. They 
vary in number from nine to fifteen. Various games are 
played on the same, or very similar boards, for which 
directions are furnished on the purchase of the apparatus. 

Other Board Games. — Among the many folding-board 
games which are deemed specially good may be named 
Parchesi, Stella, Falconry, Spider and Fly, Go Bang, Rus- 
sian Tivoli, Fox and Geese, Solitare, The Captive Princess, 
Cats and Mice, Ambuscade, Steeple Chase Game, John 
Gilpin, The Pilgrim's Progress, and The Monopolist, 

CARD GAMES. 

Aside from the ordinary playing-cards with their almost 
limitless varieties, there is a splendid assortment of other 
cards, both instructive and amusing. Every stationer and 
toy-dealer has these at various prices and with full directions 
for playing. 

MENTAL GAMES. 

Dictionary. — A long but familiar word is announced to a 
company and two minutes are allowed in which to write all 
the words which can possibly be formed from the letters of 
the assigned word. Any word of two or more letters is 
allowed, proper names and foreign terms excepted. Any 
letter of the assigned word may be used twice or oftener in 
any written word. At the end of two minutes the writing 
stops and each list is read. Every word which two or more 
persons have written is stricken from the lists ; every word 
written by one only counts for the writer as many as there 
are parties in the game. If five play, each exclusive word 
counts its writer five, etc. The party announcing the word 
does not write, but is counted, and directs the reading of 
the written words in turn from his right. 



620 THE HOISEWIFK S LIBRARY. 

Twenty Questions. — This game was once so popular among 
the Cambridge professors that they declared any subject 
could be reached in ten questions. The company divides 
into questioners and answerers. After the subject is chosen, 
questions are asked in some such form as this : Is it animal, 
vegetable, or mineral ? What is its size ? To what age 
does it belong ? Is it historical or natural ? Is it ancient 
or modern ? etc. A few objects do not belong clearly to 
either of these classes, or they touch, possibly, on all three ; 
but even these can be mastered. The questioners may con- 
sult openly about their question before asking it, but the 
answerers must be very cautious in consultation lest they 
disclose too much. Among the more difficult subjects are 
such as a mummy, a tear, a blush, a smile, an echo, an ava- 
lanche, a drought, etc. Puns and evasive answers must not 
be used. 

The Secretary. — All the players sit at a table and are fur- 
nished with paper and pencil. Each writes his name, and 
having folded it back carefully, hands his paper to the secre- 
tary, who shuffles the papers, distributes them again, and 
says, " Character ;" whereupon each writes a supposed trait 
of character. The papers are again folded, reshuffled, an4 
redistributed, when " Future" is announced, and each writes 
to this idea on his slip. Other points, not to exceed six in 
all, are named and written upon, and the whole list is then 
read from each paper, affording a most amusing record. 

Rhyming Game. — The leader selects a word capable of 
many rhymes. Beginning with the first of the company, he 
says, for example, " I have a word that rhymes with oney 

" Is it a female recluse ?" asks the party addressed. 

" No, it is not a mm," is replied. Passing on to the second 
person, this one may ask, " Is it something good to eat ?" 

" No, it is not a dun." The third may ask, " Is it a heavy 
weight ?" 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. {^'l\ 

" No, It is not a (on." The fourth may ask, " Is it some- 
thing that makes you laugh ?" 

" Yes, it is Fun." 

The party failing to question promptly pays a forfeit ; so 
does the leader if he fail to answer promptly. The party 
catching his word becomes the new leader. 

Acting Game. — Half the players go out of the room and 
those within decide on a word, telling the others a word 
with which it rhymes. The outer party then enter and act 
out a word which they suppose to be correct. For instance, 
if the word rhymes with main, the actors come in with 
umbrellas, overshoes, waterproofs, stepping carefully, etc., 
and the inside party says, " No, it is not rain." The outs 
retire to consult, and, returning with bags and baggage, imi- 
tate passengers hurrying to get on the cars. " No, it is not 
train!' Again they retire, consult, and re-enter. One of 
them with a mock club strikes a companion, who falls to the 
ground. " Yes, it is Slain." The sides then exchange 
places. If the word is not guessed, either as announced by 
its rhyme or as acted, the party failing goes out again. 

Crambo. — Each player writes a noun and a question. All 
are then shuffled, nouns together and questions. Each 
player then draws one from each set of slips and writes four 
lines in rhyme, answering the question and introducing the 
word. The efforts to meet these requirements will provoke 
an abundance of fun. 

FUN IN GENERAL. 

(lOing to Jerusalem. — Place a row of chairs, alternating 
backs and fronts, and one less in number than the parties in 
the game. A march tune is then played, and the pilgrims 
move around the line of chairs. Suddenly the music stops, 
when each one tries to drop into a seat. Of course one 
person is left. He retires from the game and a chair is 



622 THE IIOUSEWIFKS LIBRARY. 

removed from the line. The music and marching are re- 
peated, and another party is dropped, and so on till one 
remains in occupancy of the one chair. This person is victor 
in the contest. 

Magic Music. — One person leaves the room and the others 
agree on something, no matter how difficult if only practi- 
cable, which he must do. He enters to music, which is loud 
as he nears his point of operation and soft as he departs. 
By this modulation he is guided to the thing desired and 
almost inevitably does in the end the precise act intended. 

Ma^etized Cane. — 'Let a gentleman prepare beforehand 
by attaching to his pantaloons, above the knee and from one 
leg to the other, a fine black-silk strand about fifteen or 
eighteen inches long. Proposing in the company to mag- 
netize a cane, let him take such an article and rub it faith- 
fully. Then, standing it erect between his separated knees, 
and carefully poising it with his hands, let it lean against 
the stretched thread of silk. It will seem to stand alone, 
to the amazement of the uninitiated, who will struggle 
hard to accomplish the same feat. 

The Charmed Quarter. — Let the company select one of three 
quarter-dollars and mark it so as to know it certainly." The 
other two meanwhile are laid on a marble maiitel. Let the 
company all handle the piece and examine the mark ; then, 
having tossed it into a hat — the other two quarters being 
lightly tipped into the same receptacle and all shaken up for 
an instant — a touch will indicate the marked coin, as by 
handling it will have become warm ; the others, by lying on 
the marble, having become cold. The detection is almost in- 
evitable. If it fail, more " magnetism," imparted by a longer 
holding of it in the hand of a spectator, will disclose the 
correct coin. 

Dynamite. — Cross three wooden toothpicks as if they 
\i'ere. spokes in a wheel, but leave the side spaces la*-ger 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. 



623 



than the' other two. Cross two other picks over two ends 
of these and under one of them, so as to bind the five in a 










tight frame. On this lay a sixth toothpick to represent 
John Chinaman on his bed. Then apply a match to one 
end of the frame pieces. This represents the Hoodluiu 



624 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

blowing up the Chinaman. When the fire creeps in to the 
point where the picks cross and bind each other, the spring 
of the wood will hurl the Chinaman high in the air, illustra- 
ting dynamite action, and causing a hearty laugh. 

Paxlor Magic. — An immense amount of fun can be had by 
means of the parlor magic, or trick sets, to be had in great 
variety. Some of the exploits thus attainable are quite 
puzzling to the observer, especially if the manipulator be 
dexterous, and, withal, entertaining of speech. Sets of appa- 
ratus carry also complete instruction, but practice is needed 
to make perfect. 

Manuals on Games, Amuspments, etc. — On all points of home 
amusement there are valuable treatises or manuals — some 
large, some small, but all suggestive. If enjoyment is 
sought in a house, the means of enjoyment must be studied. 
Study, therefore, to make home happy.

So many and so rich are earth's resources, that, when the wisest man has 
wearied with his discourse, numberless things remain unsaid — yea, quite 
unthought of — by the sage. 

BUFFON. 



General Hints. 



AFTER the broad scope of this book has' been covered, 
there still remain many things to be said. They are 
hardly worth discussion ; mere statement is sufficient. 
They are hints merely on a variety of subjects. Let it not 
be supposed that every suggestion here given has been 
subjected to test by the editor of the department. But 
every one h£is been culled from a trustworthy source and 
has been subjected to careful scrutiny. All of them are 
worth trying; but try them conscientiously. More pre- 
scriptions have failed from unskillful handling than from 
inherent defect. An Irish cook who delayed some fifteen 
minutes when his master had ordered a soft-boiled egg, 
excused himself by declaring that it had boiled fast all the 
time, but showed no signs whatever of becoming soft. So 
many other domestic manipulators fail. 

HINTS FOR THE KITCHEN. 

To Keep Meat FresL — Take a quart of best vinegar, two 
ounces of lump sugar, two ounces of salt. Boil these 
together for a few minutes, and when cold anoint with a 
brush the meat to be preserved. For fish the mixture is to 
be applied inside ; for poultry, both in and outside. Or : 
Place the meat in the centre of a clean earthenware vessel 
and closely surround it with common charcoal. Or : Cover 
the meat lightly with bran and hang it in some passage 
where there is a current of air. 

To Make Poultry Tender. — Give the fowl, shortly before 
killing, a tablespoonful of vinegar. 

627 



628 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

To Test Mushrooms. — In eatable mushrooms the stalk and 
top are dirty white and the lower part has a hning of salmon 
fringe, which changes to russet or brown soon after they 
are gathered. The poisonous manifest all colors, and those 
which are dead white above and below should be let alone. 
Sprinkle salt on the spongy part, and if they turn yellow 
they are poisonous, but if they become black they are 
good. Let the salt remain on a little while before you 
decide on the color. Mushrooms are in season during 
September and October. 

To Keep Flour Sweet. — Insert a triangular tube of boards 
or tin bored full of small holes, into the centre of the barrel, 
which allows the air to reach the middle of the meal, and it 
never gets musty. A barrel of good flour, dry as it appears 
to be, contains from twelve to sixteen pounds of water. 

To Test Coal Oil. — Pour a little oil in an iron spoon and 
heat it over a lamp until it is moderately warm to the 
touch. If the oil produces vapor which can be set on fire 
by a flame held a short distance above the liquid, it is bad. 

To Remove Clinkers. — Throw half a dozen broken oyster 
shells into the fire when the coal is all aglow, and cover 
them with fresh coal. When all are red hot the clinkers 
become doughy, and are easily removed. 

Cheap Pire-Kindler. — Melt three pounds of rosin in a quart 
of tar, and stir in as much saw-dust and pulverized charcoal 
as you can. Spread the mass upon a board till cool, then 
break into lumps as big as your thumb. Light it with a 
match. 

To Keep a Broom. — If a broom be inserted every week in 
boiling suds, it will be toughened and last much longer, will 
not cut the carpet, and will remain elastic as a new broom. 

To Preserve Oil-cloths. — An oil-cloth should never be 
"scrubbed ; but after being swept it should be cleaned with 



GENERAL HINTS. 629 

a soft cloth and lukewarm or cold water. Never use soap, 
or water that is hot. When dry, sponge it over with milk ; 
then wipe with a soft, dry cloth. 

To Prevent a Lamp flx)m Smoking. — Soak the wick in vine- 
gar, and dry it well before using. 

To Remove Rnst from SteeL — Cover with sweet oil, well 
rubbed on, and let it remain forty-eight hours, then rub 
with unslacked lime powdered fine. 

To Prevent Rust — Take one pint of fat-oil varnish, mixed 
with five pints of highly rectified spirits of turpentine, and 
rub with a sponge on bright stoves or mathematical instru- 
ments, and they will never contract spots of rust. 

To Freslien Stale Bread or Cake. — Plunge the loaf one 
instant in cold water and lay it upon a tin in the stove for 
ten or fifteen minutes. It will be like new bread, without 
its deleterious qualities. Stale cake is thus made as nice as 
new cake. Use immediately. 

To Soften Hard Water. — Put half an ounce of quicklime in 
nine quarts of water. This solution in a barrel of hard 
water will make it soft. A teaspoonful of sal soda will 
soften from three to four pails of hard water. 

Time of Boiling Green Vegetables. — This depends very much 
upon the age, and how long they have been gathered. The 
younger and more freshly gathered, the more quickly they 
are cooked. The following is Miss Parloa's time-table for 
cooking : 



Potatoes, boiled, . . 30 minutes. 
Potatoes, baked, . . _^4S minutes. 
Sweet Potatoes, boiled, 4^ minutes.

630 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Keeping Hams. — After smoking, make coarse cotton cloth 
sacks so that one ham will go in easily, pack cut hay all 
around between the sack and the ham, tie the sack at the 
top, hang in a cool place, and be sure the sacks are whole. 

To Make Shirts Glossy. — Take of raw starch, one ounce • 
gum arable, one drachm; white of egg, half ounce; soluble 
glass, quarter of an ounce ; water. IVlake starch into fine 
cream, dissolve with gum in a little hot water, cool and mix 
it with the &^^, and beat up the mixture with starch liquid; 
then add the water, glass (solution), and shake together. 
Moisten the starched linen with a cloth dipped in the liquid, 
and use polishing iron to develop gloss. 

Blackening Stoves. — If a little vinegar or cider is mixed 
with stove polish it will not take so much rubbing to make 
the stove bright, and the blackening is not likely to fly off 
in fine dust. 

Musty Coffee and Tea Pots. — These may be cleaned and 
sweetened by putting wood ashes into them and filling 
them with cold water. Set on the stove to heat gradually 
till the water boils. Let it boil a short time, then put aside 
to cool, when the inside should be faithfully washed and 
scrubbed in hot soap-suds. 

To Clean Pots and Kettles. — When washing greasy pots and 
kettles, take a handful of meal or bran and rub all around. 
It absorbs all the grease and leaves them perfectly clean. 

To Clean Ceiliiigs Smoked by Kerosene Lamps. — Wash with a 
sufficiently strong solution of soda in water. 

To Prepare a New Iron Kettle for Use. — Fill with clean potato 
parings ; boil them for an hour or more, then wash the 
kettle with hot water, wipe it dry, and rub it with a little 
lard ; repeat the rubbing half a dozen times after using. 

To Remove Fruit Stains. — Procure a bottle of Javelle water. 
If the stains are wet with this before the articles are put 



GE.VESAL HINTS. (J31 

into the wash they will be completely removed. Those who 
cannot get Javelle water can make a solution of chloride of 
lime. Four ounces of the chloride of lime is to be put into 
a quart of water in a bottle, and after thoroughly shaking 
allow the dregs to settle. The clear liquid will remove the 
stains. Be careful to thoroughly rinse the article in clear 
water before bringing^it in contact with soap. When Javelle 
water is used this precaution is not necessary; with chloride 
of lime liquid it is, or the article will be harsh and stiff. 

Washing. — To wash flannels: First, never apply soap 
directly to any woolen fabric. Make a strong, hot suds and 
plunge the garment in it. Second, never dip a flannel in 
cold, or even cool, water, but always hot. Wash first in hot 
suds and rinse in hot water made very blue. Third, dry 
flannels as quickly as possible. Wring diy from the second 
water and hang either in the hot sun or before a brisk fire. 
When nearly dry, press with a hot iron. None but soft 
water should be used upon flannels, and resin soap is much 
inferior to common soft soap, as it hardens the fibres of 
woolens. 

To wash chintz : Take two pounds of rice and boil it in 
two gallons of water till soft. When done, pour the whole 
in a tub ; let it stand till of about the warmth you use in 
general for colored linens ; then put the chintz in and use 
the rice instead of soap. Wash it in this till the dirt appears 
to be out ; then boil the same quantity, as above, but strain 
the rice from the water and mix it in warm, clear water. 
Wash in this till quite clean ; afterward rinse it in the water 
in which you have boiled the rice. This will answer the 
end of starch and no dew will aflect it and it will be stiff as 
long as you wear it. 

To wash clothes without fading them : Peel Irish pota- 
toes and grate them in cold water. Saturate the articles to 
be washed in this potato-water and they can then be washed 



632 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARV. 

with soap without any running of the color. Oil may be 
taken out of carpets with this potato-water when simple cold 
wiater would make the color run ruinously. This will also 
set the color in figured black muslins, in colored merinos, 
in ribbons, and other silk goods. Often the potato-water 
cleanses sufficiently without the use of soap ; but the latter 
is necessary where there is any grease. When no soap is 
needed, take the grated potato and rub the goods with a 
flannel rag. 

Sour milk removes iron-rust from white goods. 

To make silk which.has been wrinkled appear exactly like 
new, sponge it on the surface with a weak solution of gum 
arable or white glue, and iron on the wrong side. 

A tablespoonful of black pepper put in the first water in 
which gray or buff linens are washed will keep them from 
spotting. It will also keep the colors of colored or black 
cambrics or muslin from running, and does not harden the 
water. 

To extract ink from cotton, silk, and woolen goods, satu- 
rate the spot with spirits of turpentine and let it remain 
several hours ; then rub it between the hands. It will dis- 
appear without injuring the color or texture of the fabric. 
For linen, dip the spotted part in pure tallow and the ink 
will disappear. 

When clothes have acquired an unpleasant odor by being 
kept from the air, charcoal laid in the folds will remove it. 

To take oil or grease from cloth : Drop on the spot 
some oil of tartar or salt of wormwood which has been left 
in a damp place until it is fluid ; then immediately wash the 
place with lukewarm soft water and then with cold water, 
and the spot will disappear.

PREFACE. 



HOUSEWIFE is in many repects a better word than 
housekeeper. One may keep house in a cold and per- 
functory style. A housekeeper may be a mere hire- 
ling, with no interest whatever in the establishment beyond 
the wages drawn from it. But a liousewife is one wedded to 
the house and its interests. She is not a slave to the house, 
as a wife is not a slave to her husband ; but both love the 
object of their espousal, and labor with supreme regard for 
the best good of that object. For those who thus love 
home this book has been prepared. 

All persons are not housewives nor yet housekeepers, but 
all are presumed to dwell in houses. These houses are kept 
by somebody, and the manner in which they are kept very 
materially affects the happiness of those who dwell therein. 
Therefore, all persons have a direct interest in whatever will 
help housekeepers to keep house in better style and to 
make the household more healthy and more happy. 

Some helps are hindrances. They are so hard to grasp, 
and when grasped they are so hard to handle, and when 
handled they afford so little in return, and what they do 
afford is so worthless that, though they be helps in name 
and in aim, yet in fact they are hindrances only. This book 
is not of that class. Whatever will render genuine assist- 
ance has been secured for it, regardless of cost or toil. 
What would be useless in such a book has been rejected, 
however attractive it seemed. It is believed that every 
housewife will find nothing here to neglect, but much to 
use and profit by. 



yi PREFACE. 

Many books are epitomized in this. Cooking-, Furnish- 
ing, Management, Etiquette, Games, Emergencies, Care of 
Children, and every other desirable domestic topic, on 
which volumes have been written, find treatment here. It 
is indeed a Housewife's Library. It fiarnishes " many 
volumes in one." 

Its contents are arranged for ready reference. In the 
pages immediately following, this appears at a glance. All 
that is contained in the book is there summarized. The nine 
departments are believed to cover every phase of the house- 
wife's wants. A full index has been added also. The reader 
need not pause to locate a topic in the Table of Contents, 
but he will be guided at once to its treatment by reference 
to the index pages. Quick and certain access to what the 
book contains is thus assured. 

Nor is it a mere recipe book. It does not simply tell 
what to do and how to act ; it seeks to build from the foun- 
dation laid deeply in the nature of things. There are good 
and sufficient reasons for most of the customs of society. 
He who understands these, catches the spirit of the whole 
matter and cannot get far astray, even though he be ignor- 
ant of the exact letter of the law. 

Illustrations have been freely employed because of their 
undoubted helpfulness. But the plan of making the language 
of the book so plain that all obscurity may be dispelled has 
been steadily adhered to. It is both complete and clear. 

The Housewives of America aspire to the best things in 
their homes. This Library will prove a splendid helper to 
their progress.

FIRST DEPARTMENT. 



DOMESTIC COOKERY. 



Oh ! better no doubt is a dinner of herbs, 
When season'd by love, which no rancor disturbs, 
And sweeten'dby all that is sweetest in life 
Than turbot, bisque, ortolans, eaten in strife ! 
But if out of humor, and hungry, alone 
A man should sit down to dinner, eacn one 
Of the dishes of which the Cook chooses to spoil 
With a horrible mixture of garlic and oil, 
The chances are ten against one, I must own. 
He gets up as ill-tempered as when he sat down. 

Owen Meredith. 



Domestic Cookery. 



THERE is a beautiful legend that tells how Elizabeth of 
Hungary, having been forbidden by her lord to carry 
food to the poor, was met by him one day outside the 
castle walls as she was bearing a lapful of meat and bread 
to her pensioners. Louis demanding sternly what she car- 
ried in her robe, she was obliged to show him the forbidden 
burden. " Whereupon," says the chronicler, " the food was 
miraculously changed, for his eyes, to a lapful of roses, 
red and white, and his mind disabused of suspicion, he gra- 
ciously bade her pass on withersoever she would." 

It would be well for some husbands if " their eyes were 
holden " in such a way that food served them would seem 
other and better than it really is. But the sense of taste is 
a rebellious member — especially in the men. It will cry out 
against the best appearing dish, if its flavor is not of the 
best. There is but one way to sure success. The house- 
wife herself must be the angel who casts the spell about the 
humble board and the lowly fare, and invests them with 
forms and odors of irresistible attractiveness. This is the 
true poetry of Domestic Cookery; and blessed is the 
home where one presides who knows this art, and makes 
each meal a feast, and every guest a glad participant.

16 .THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

But things do not always take so happy a form. For 
instance : there was recently a brutal murder in Troy; N. Y., 
and a paper, reporting the case, clumsily , said : " A poor 
woman was killed yesterday in her own home, while cooking 
her husband's breakfast in a shocking manner." Quoting 
this statement, a contemporary remarked : " There are 
many women who cook their husbands' breakfasts in a 
shocking manner, but it is seldom that justice overtakes 
them so summarily." The subject is a serious one to joke 
over, but the turn given by the commenting paper is bright 
and suggestive. 

The fact is, that by skillful manipulation the plainest fare 
may be transformed into dishes fit for kings, while by igno- 
rance and inattention the best viands may be rendered unfit 
for human food. Which turn should housewives attempt to 
give their own culinary affairs? There can be but one 
reply. But, be it remembered, that freaks of favoring for- 
tune, such as came to Elizabeth, come only to those who 
are zealously pursuing the line of helpful duty. There is 
no royal road to success as a housekeeper or a cook. You 
must " work your passage," but the way will be smoothed 
by careful study of pages such as follow, provided the study 
take shape in wise action. 

Remember, too, that the ministry of Domestic Cookery 
is by no means an unimportant one. It is worthy of the 
best attention of any housewife. 

*' The stomach," says an eminent medical authority, " is 
the mainspring of our system ; if it be not sufficiently wound 
up to warm and support the circulation, the whole business 
of life will, in proportion, be ineffectually performed ; we can 
neither think with precision, walk with vigor, sit down with 
comfort, nor sleep with tranquility. There would be no 
difficulty in proving that it influences (much more than 
people imagine) all our actions." Dyspepsia is a fearful foe 
to the human race. 



I.— THE ART OF COOKING. 

THERE is a science and there is an art of cooking. The 
science tells what should be done and why ; the art takes 
hold and does the thing, without, in most cases, knowing 
any reason why certain methods produce certain results. 
The one is theoretical, the other practical ; the ^ one deals 
with principles, the other with performances. 

The science of cookery proceeds on the basis that man 
needs certain elements of repair and growth for the various 
tissues of his body, that these elements exist in nature in 
various fojms, and that the mission of the cook is so to 
prepare these suitable substances that man may receive 
them in their most enjoyable and assimilable forms, and thus 
have his waste repaired and his growth provided for. This 
basis is solid. On it the whole culinary system is founded. 
But, from the merely utilitarian idea of repairing waste and 
supplying force, cookery rises to the supreme height of 
exquisitely delighting the taste while doing its most impor- 
tant work of feeding the body. Indeed, the art of cooking 
well, and of serving well-cooked victuals well, is ''a fine art " 
in the best sense of the term. There are artistes in 
this line. Meals may be served artistically. They may 
become a delight to- the most refined natures and a real 
benefaction to both body and soul. 

The great aim of all cooking is to retain all the valuable 
elements of the food, and to put them into such forms as 
shall awake desire, stimulate digestion, and secure to the 
eater, in the readiest and most pleasing way, all the nutriment 
these viands afford. For instance, in cooking meats it is 
desirable to retain all the natural juices. To this end, when 
meat is to be boiled it should be plunged into hot water, 
which at once renders the outer part measurably impenetra- 
2 17 



Jg THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

ble, ana so confines the juices. On the other hand, if the 
juices are to be drawn out for the production of soup, it 
must be placed in cold water, and gradually warmed and 
slowly boiled, so as to allow the exudation of the juices. 
On the same principle, broiling and roasting, by quickly clos- 
ing the surface of the meat, retain the juices as well as the 
odors, and make the meat both juicy and savory. The re- 
tention of the fatty substances renders such preparations 
somewhat less digestible, however, than boiled food or lean 
meat. 

High art in cookery, as elsewhere, demands high rates of 
expenditure. Instructions on that grade alone would not 
meet the want of American homes. But high aims in this 
department are equally commendable with high aims else- 
where. So important a factor in domestic economy as cook- 
ing cannot be ignored and should not be treated lightly. 
Good food, well cooked and well served, goes far to make 
home happy and its inmates healthy. 

The chemical aspect of food and cooking may be left to 
the chemist and the physiologist. They will perfect the 
scientific aspects of the case. But the art of cooking, which 
teaches just how and when to do the right things, is for us 
to learn and to practice day by day. Such is the relation of 
stomach and brain on the one side, and of stomach and 
cook on the other side, that the cook becomes the sov- 
ereign, to whom many a brain mightier than his own 
bows in servile allegiance. 

What cookery was practiced in the garden of Eden his- 
tory does not tell. Vegetarians insist that permission to 
eat animal food was not given until after the flood (Genesis 
xi, 3, 4), when, by indulgence, man's appetites had become 
abnormal. If vegetable food only were used in Eden, and 
that mainly of the nature of fruits, but little cooking was 
needed, and the simplest forms would suffice amply. Ancient 
writers say that cooking came into use immediately on the

« 

discovery of fire, whenever that was, and that its introduc- 
tion was in imitation of the natural processes of mastication 
and digestion. 

The first reference of the Bible to cooked food is to "a mor- 
sel of bread" (Genesis xviii, 5). Sarah, in this instance, made 
ready " three measures of fine meal," which she kneaded, 
and of which she made cakes " upon the hearth." These 
were, doubtless, the simplest form of unleavened cakes,

flattened thin and baked upon a hot stone. A tender calf 
was hastily dressed on this occasion also, but whether by 
boiling or stewing, by roasting on a hot stone or by broil- 
ing over the fire on the point of a stick, is not known. Cer- 
tainly, the whole dressing required but little time and was 
not very elaborate. For these same guests Lot baked un- 
leavened bread, and, as the record is, " he made them a 
feast," quite hurried and simple, no doubt. 

When Abraham's servant, searching for a wife for Isaac, 
reached her father's house, " they did eat and drink," un- 
questionably in a festive way. Isaac was so fond of veni- 
son that he became unduly partial to his son Esau, who 
excelled as a hunter in capturing game for this dish. The 
preparation of the meat was in some elaborate style, which 
Isaac denominated " savory meat," and the eating of it so 
pleased him that he spoke of it as the meat " that I love," 
and asked it " that I may eat, and that my soul may bless

thee before I die." Irreverent critics may say this was man^ 
like, but reverent ones will pronounce it quite human, and 
all may conclude that cookery was taking attractive shapes 
in that early day. So Esau thought, undoubtedly, upon see- 
ing his brother Jacob with a pottage of red lentiles. He was 
willing to sell out his birthright, with all its high preroga- 
tives, that he might eat of this tempting dish. All these in- 
cidents from the book of Genesis indicate that punctuality 
at the table and systematic forethought for its proper service 
were undeveloped arts at that time. Many later Biblical 
references indicate a higher state of culture in these respects, 
sumptuous fare and great feasts being matters of frequent 
reference. In the ceremonial law many directions were given 
concerning the killing and the cooking of animal food. 

Ovens are often mentioned in the Bible. In the cities and 
villages they were located generally in the establishments 
of bakers (Hosea vii, 4), or in large private establishments. 
Portable ovens were used by many who lived in a nomadic 
way. The portable oven was a large earthen jar, widening 
at the bottom, and having a side opening there by which to 

extract the ashes and to insert the bread 
or meat. These are referred to as the 
possession of every family, in Exodus 
viii, 3; though in time of destitution, or 
scarcity of fuel, one oven answered for 
many families, as Leviticus xxvi, 26, 
shows. These ovens could be hastily 
heated by a quick fire of twigs, grasses, 
etc., which fuel suggested the reference 
in Matthew vi, 30, to grass, which to-day 
is in the field and to-morrow is cast into

The remote East, the land of spices, was the first to

and highly seasoned dishes were first prepared there. Many 
curious notions are recorded of the various nations in re- 
spect to food and cooking. The universal custom in Oriental 
lands is to cook meat as soon as killed. It never becomes 
cold, as with us. Goose is a great favorite with the Egyp- 
tians. Plutarch says only one class of this nation would 
cat mutton, and at Thebes it was wholly prohibited. Pud- 
dings made from the blood of slaughtered animals were 
favored by Egyptians but hated by Moslems. Egyptians 
never ate the head of any animal. Pastry among them was 
worked into the shapes of animals, and was always sprinkled 
with caraway and anise. 

The Greeks esteemed cookery so highly, that royal per- 
sonages took pride in preparing their own meals. Homer's 
poems contain many illustrations of such service. 
Achilles once personally served up a great feast, its special 
feature being that smaller meats were garnished with 
entrails of oxen. It was common at great feasts of the 
Greeks to dedicate certain dishes to certain gods, and then 
to eat them in honor of those gods. 

In the time of Pericles a class of professional cooks had 
come into prominence who boasted that they could serve 
up a whole pig, boiled on one side, roasted on the other, 
stuffed with cooked birds, eggs, and other delicacies, and 
yet the whole so neatly done that it could not be discovered 
where the animal had been opened. Invention was then 
taxed to invent a new cake, or a new sauce, and he who did 
it was deemed worthy of high honor. One Greek distin- 
guished himself by devising a new method of curing hams ; 
another devised a cake which took his name and made him 
famous. In Athenian dishes, assafoetida was a popular 
ingredient, as were rue and garlick. 

To compound one famous dish, certain uninviting parts of 
soVs, asses, hawks, seals, porpoises, star-fish, etc., were 
used. One visitor to Greece, having eaten a celebrated 



22 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

" black broth;" said he had learned why the Spartans were 
in battle so fearless of death, as the pains of death were 
preferable to existence on such abominable food. A Greek 
poet, Archistratus, traveled the world over to study the 
gastronomic art, and then wrote a poem, " Gastrology," 
which became the standard among Greek epicures. Greek 
cooks took special pride in so jflavoring and disguising com- 
mon fish and meat, that epicures even would be deceived by 
their preparations. 

Roman cooking surpassed the Grecian in the more solid 
dishes, until the decline of the Empire began, when Roman 
epicures and gluttons came to the front and soon surpassed 
the world. Fishes, birds, and wines were their chief delica- 
cies, and to secure those of rarest quality the known world 
was laid under contribution. There is record of a single 
feast at which were served peacocks from Samos, chickens 
from Phrygia, kids from Melos, cranes from yEtolia, tunny 
fishes from Chalcedon, pikes from Pessinus, oysters from 
Tarentum, mussels from Chios, dates from Egypt, and inci- 
dentals from as many more points. Snails were fattened 
for table uses till their shells would contain a quart ; fishes 
and birds were fed on the choicest dainties to prepare them 
for human food, while even hogs were fattened on whey 
and dates. 

LucuUus was in the habit of spending fifty thousand 
denarii (about eight thousand dollars) on each of his sump- 
tuous feasts. Galba's daily breakfasts were each of sufficient 
cost to i^^di a hundred families. Vitellius made a single 
dish of pheasants' brains, peacocks' brains, nightingales' 
tongues, and livers of the rarest fishes. Its cost was one 
thousand sesterces (about forty thousand dollars). On 
another occasion two thousand choice fishes and seven 
thousand rare birds were served by him. It is said his 
kitchen expenses for four months amounted to twenty-five 
million dollars.

Heliogabalus had a favorite dish for his own suppers 
made from the brains of six hundred thrushes. Pork was 
the choice Roman dish at a later day. It was often served 
in the famous style already referred to, benig half baked,

half boiled, and stuffed with birds, eggs, etc. The process 
of this preparation was long a profound and marvelous 
secret. It was accomplished, however, by bleeding the'

throat, and refilling by the same passage. The upper side 
was then baked while the lower lay imbedded in a thick 
paste of barley meal mixed with wine and oil. The paste 
was then removed and the lower side boiled in a shallow 
saucepan.

Cooking utensils were elaborately made for the homes of 
the rich. The finest grades were made of bronze, and 
usually they were plated with silver. Some articles were 
of brass, others even of silver. Kitchens were royal apart- 
ments then, many of them having marble floors and being 
decorated with co.stly paintings. Even the aspirations of

our modern " help" would have been gratified fully by the 
kitchen appointments of those days. Schools of cookery, 
under the most accomplished professional care, were nu- 
merous at that time. 

One of the most princely pieces of extravagance ever 
brought out by good cooking was in the case of Antony. 
When Cleopatra praised a repast he furnished, Antony at 
once called the cook and presented him with a city. An- 
other piece of extravagance was when Lucullus entertained

Cicero and Pompey. They three partook of a little feast 
which cost not less than five thousand dollars. Geta in- 
sisted on as many courses at his state dinners as there were 
letters in the alphabet, and each course was required to 
contain every viand known, the name of which began with 
that letter. Alexander the Great once entertained ten 
thousand guests, all of whom were seated at the tables at 
one time, and in silver chairs upholstered with purple. Pos- 
sibly the most extensive "spread" ever made was by the 
Earl of Warwick when his brother was installed Arch-

bishop of York in 1479. ^^^ record of its appointments is 
as follows : 300 quarters of wheat, 300 tuns of ale, 104 tuns

poises. The Earl in person was steward; 1,000 servitors, 
62 chief cooks, and 515 under cooks and scullions offi- 
ciated on this monster occasion. 

After the fifth century it is said that " cookery, like learn- 
ing, retired into convents." For several centuries religious 
houses alone were the abodes of good cooking. In the 
tenth century the art reappeared among the wealthier citizens 
of Italy. Discoveries of new countries and the increasing 
activity of commerce continually enlarged the field for gas- 
tronomic delights. Italy, the leader in fine cookery in those 
days, began to send her methods and her cooks into France, 
where they received a hearty welcome from Catharine de 
Medici and her royal spouse. Under these fostering im- 
pulses several cities became famous for specialties in food ; 
Hamburg, for example, for hams, Strasburg for sausages, 
Arnsterdam for herrings, Ostend for oysters, Chartres for 
pies, etc., etc. 

The ancient Britons and Saxons knew none of the refine- 
ments of the culinary art. Their meal was simple bruised 
barley ; their meat, half-cooked game. The Danes did 
more at drinking than at eating, at brewing than at baking. 
The Normans, however, introduced the better styles of food 
and the cook again loomed up grandly. So great was 
the excess of these times that the friars of St. Swithin's com- 



THE ART OF COOKING. 27 

plained to King Henry II that three of their thirteen regu^ 
lar dinner courses had been withheld from them by their 
abbot. Cranmer ordered, in 1541, that archbishops should 
be limited to six dishes of meat daily, bishops to five, and 
lower orders of clergy to four, or three in certain cases. 
The poultry to be used was also limited, and the fish. 

After the Crusades the higher classes of England imitated 
the luxurious methods they had learned abroad. Peacocks be- 
came a favorite dish. They were usually served with the 
tail feathers remaining and spread to their fullest extent. In 
the reigfn of Elizabeth cooks reached the zenith of their 
power, many classical scholars willingly espousing this pro- 
fession. 

The early inhabitants of France subsisted chiefly on roots 
and acorns. After their subjugation by Caesar they quickly 
took on the Roman methods, and later the Norman methods, 
until in the fourteenth century they produced Taillevant, 
the greatest cook of history. In the reign of Louis XII a 
company was chartered to make sauces and another to cook 
meats on the spit. These were the days when fancy cook- 
ing ran toward the impossible. Eggs cooked on the spit, 
butter fried, roasted, etc., were the surprising delicacies 
produced by the masters of gastronomy. 

In the days of Louis XIV cookery in France was at its 
height of sumptuousness. A reaction in favor of modera- 
tion then began to prevail. Cooks were out of employment. 
Restaurants then appeared under their care, and they soon 
found abundant patronage. Careme, of France, is con- 
fessedly the greatest of modern French cooks. He has 
exalted the science of cookery while he has nobly advanced 
the art. 

There are several national or provincial dishes which are 
well known; for example, the roast beef and plum pudding 
of England ; the sauerkraut of Germany ; the salt beef of 
Holland ; the pilUm of Turkey (made of rice and mutton

fat) ; the macaroni of Italy ; the potatoes of Ireland ; the 
oat-meal of Scotland ; the pork and beans and the pumpkin 
pie of New England. 

Books on the science and the art of cookery are 
numerous. The oldest dates from the last half of the four- 
teenth century. It is from a Frenchman, Le Sage, who has 
blended moral maxims and culinary recipes in a wonderful 
manner. The next in order is from Taillevant, already 
referred to, dated 1 392. Scappi, chief cook to Pope Pius 
V, published a valuable book on cookery in 1570. So have 
they been multiplied as the years have rolled by, and one 
who is not an expert in cookery cannot lay his defect at the 
door of authors or publishers. 

But books are not sufficient to elevate a people. There 
must be instruction, by which the text-books may be ex- 
pounded and their lessons be illustrated' to the masses. The 
art of cookery must be learned, as are the other arts. There 
are those who say that domestic cooking should be learned 
in the home — that the mother should teach the daughters, 
and that skill and knowledge should thus be handed down 
from generation to generation. This is a splendid theory ; 
but if the mothers themselves are ignorant and unskillful, 
what then can be hoped for from the daughters ? Then, too, 
a fixed set of culinary traditions would be handed down in 
each family by this method, and the children would follow 
the ways of the parents, irrespective of better .ways practiced 
by their next-door neighbors. 

In the face of these facts, it was not at all strange that 
schools of cookery arose centuries ago ; but it is strange 
that these schools were not extended in their scope, to in- 
clude others than professional cooks. They aimed merely 
to provide skilled help for the kitchens of royalty and 
wealth. This they did to perfection, but the common people 
know nothing of the methods whereby their plain fare might 
be made more toothsome or more beneficial. It has re-

mained for this later day, this utilitarian age, to establish 
schools designed to furnish good, practical cooks, for our 
homes, and to develop them from our wives and cur 
daughters. 

This " cooking-school " movement arose in England. 
The working classes there were so sadly unskilled in 
using provision, and provision was so enormously costly, 
that the question necessarily arose. Is there no way where- 
'by these masses can use what little they have to better ad- 
vantage ? Hov/ to make the most of what was in their 
kitchens was the practical problem. Schools of domestic 
economy then arose, under the patronage of benevolent per- 
sons, to promote the practical solution of this difficulty. 

The managers of the South Kensington Museum of Arts, 
in West London, made the first organized movement in this 
matter by establishing public lectures on the preparation of 
food, with platform demonstrations of various culinary 
operations. But the inadequacy of this course was soon evi- 
dent. Exposition and illustration were good, but practice 
was needed. Cookery is like music, in that the only way to 
do it well is to do it zvcll. Lectures on the capabilities of 
the piano, though supplemented by brilliant illustration, 
could never make musicians, and the course inaugurated at 
Kensington Museum was not capable of making cooks. 
Practice schools soon became an admitted necessity. 

To found schools of this character was no easy task. 
Public sentiment was not up to the need. Teachers, text- 
books, and even pupils were wanting. It was unavoidably 
an expensive method of education, and no great names stood 
ready to back the movement. But the parties chiefly in- 
terested were determined, and they moved onward. The 
first organized classes for graded instructions and practice 
in cookery were formed in 1874. These classes were open 
to all, but especial encouragement was given to those pro- 
posing to go out as teachers of this art. In this respect the 



30 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

work was a great success, and large numbers of cooking- 
schools have been formed in England. 

These schools employ a series of printed " lessons," 
suited for use in all the work in all the various grades. 
These lessons contained a list of ingredients needed for each 
dish, with their quantity and cost. Then followed a specifi- 
cation of the several steps to be taken, each distinct in itself 
and numbered. Nothing was assumed to be known ; 
nothing was here taken for granted, all was clearly specified 
and, if need be, explained. As trial showed defects in the 
several lessons, they were carefully revised, and at last text- 
books were issued. Every pupil learned what to do in each 
case ; then they did it ; then they kept on doing it until they 
could do it to perfection. As at " Dotheboys Hall," he whose 
turn it was to spell " scrub " was set to scrub the floor, etc., 
etc., so at these practice schools, she who studied " Irish 
stevv^," made Irish stew, and capped the climax by eating it. 

It is surprising that so diversified a company gathered in 
these schools. An observer of the Kensington Museum 
establishment says of the attendance : ** There were cultivated 
ladies, the daughters of country gentlemen, old house- 
keepers, servants, cooks, and colored girls from South 
Africa, together with a large proportion of intelligent young 
women who were preparing to become teachers." 

It may strike one who goes over these lessons that there 
is a wearisome attention to trivial details. But it should not 
be forgotten that the chief difference between good and bad 
cookery lies just here. It is a prime point in cooking- 
schools to make each item so prominent that it cannot be 
overlooked. Strict attention to details is the corner-stone 
of the culinary art. 

Schools of cookery are now numerous in this country. 
New York, Philadelphia, and all the principal cities have 
institutions of this character. Text-books are numerous 
too. Eliza A. Youmans, Juliet Corson, and other ladies 



THE ART OF COOKING. %\ 

have nobly led the van of culinary artistes, and their man- 
uals are standards for cooking-schools. 

To illustrate the method of the cooking-schools, two 
'" lessons " are here added, both on the making of Cabinet 
Pudding. The first is from the American edition of Lessons 
in Cookery, the handbook of the London school. 

LESSON :— CABINET PUDDING. 

Ingredients. — One dozen cherries or raisins, and two or three pieces of 
angelica. One dozen finger biscuits and half a dozen ratafias. One ounce 
of loaf-sugar and fifteen drops of essence of vanilla. Four eggs. One 
pint of milk. 

Time required, about one hour.. - 

To make a Cabinet Pudding: 

1 . Take a pint-and-a-half mold and butter it inside with 
your fingers. 

2. Take a dozen raisins or dried cherries^ and two or three 
pieces of angelica, ^.'^di ornament the bottom of the mold with 
them. 

3. Take one dosen stale sponge finger-biscidts^ and break 
them in pieces, 

4. Partly fill the mold with pieces of cake and a half a 
dozen ratafias.^ 

5. Take four yelks and two whites of eggs and put them 
in a basin. 

6. Add to the eggs one ounce of white sugar, and whip 
them together lightly. 

7. Stir in, by degrees, one pint of milk. 

8. Flavor it by adding fifteen drops of essence of vanilla. 

9. Pour this mixture over the cakes in the mold. 

10. Place a piece of buttered paper over the top of the 
mold. 

11. Take a saucepan half full of boiling water, and stand 
it on the side of the fire.

12. Stand the mold in the saucepan, to steam for from 
three-quarters of an hour to an hour. 

N. B. — The water should only reach half way up the mold, or it would 
boil over and spoil the pudding. 

13. For serving, turn the pudding carefully out of the 
mold on to a hot dish." 

The other " lesson " is from Miss Corson's Cooking- 
school Text-book. It is the method pursued in the New 
York Cooking-school and its offshoots.

THE ART OF COOKING. ■ 33 

Every city has its leading caterer, who illustrates, when 
opportunity offers, to what heights the gastronomic art may 
be carried. On special occasions great " spreads " are made, 
the cost of which will surprise the uninitiated. From two 
to five dollars per plate is an ordinary charge for these en- 
tertainments. Ten dollars for each guest is by no means 
unusual. Twenty-five dollars for each guest, the wines in- 
cluded, is a price often charged, and Delmonico, of New 
York, furnished a dinner to ten persons, the cost of which 
was estimated to be no less than four hundred dollars each. 

The dinner was given by a, distinguished yachting-man, 
who insisted that the five men in waiting should be dressed 
as sailors. He furnished the suits, new and elegant. The 
guests drank, or tasted, every vinted liquor that has ever been 
brought to America — not that they drank every brand of 
wine, but every grade was represented. They finished with 
2,pousse cafe made of eleven liquors. 

The bills of fare were a striking feature of the display. 
Before each plate sat a cut-glass basin, about twenty inches 
in diameter and four inches deep. Each was nearly filled 
with water, perfumed with ottar of roses, on the surface of 
which floated half-open pond lilies. In the basin a perfect 
model of the yacht owned by the gentleman who gave the 
dinner was placed. It was cut in red cedar wood, with 
cabin, rail, wheel for steering, brass work, such as belaying- 
pins, binnacle, etc., man ropes worked and trimmed with 
sailor knots, scraped pine masts and booms, rigging of 
silken cords colored as it would be in the prototype, and 
sails of satin. 

The sails carried the bills of fare. On the flying jib were 

the words: " Compliments of ," naming the giver of 

the dinner; on the jib the date and place; on the foresail 
was the name of the guest who sat at the place where each 
little vessel floated ; and on the mainsail was the niemt. As 
the guest had occasion to consult his bill of fare, he used a 
3 



34 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRA R V. 

little gold oar that rested on the fingers of a silver naiad 
who peered over the containing glass, and held out both 
hands to grasp the oar. After the dinner each guest either 
carried away his bill of fare or had it sent to his home. The 
bills of fare were supposed to have cost at least one hundred 
dollars apiece. Of course, the viands spread at such a table 
were the finest the markets of the world could afford. 

An artistic conclusion to an elaborate luncheon in New 
York is thus described by one who was there : " The last 
course was quite classic. A Greek would have appreciated it. 
It would have given him visions of Hybla and Hymettus, and 
their • luxuriant growth of wild thyme. Everything was 
removed from the table except the ferns in the centre. A 
glass jug, some small glasses, and a plate of water crackers 
were brought in. The hostess poured out for each guest a 
tiny glass of metheglin. Any one who had forgotten the 
old reputation of this liquor and of what it was made would 
have been enlightened by seeing the jug. It looked like a 
honeycomb. Through the wax-looking cells painted upon 
its surface the liquor appeared like yellow honey. On the 
stopper was a black and gold bee. The caster, or tray, in 
which the jug stood was of glass also, covered with white 
clover and other heather . flowers, which give the delicate 
flavor to Scotch and French honey. • Such a finale seems to 
claim for America mention among those nations which 
Shakespeare describes as ' exquisite in their drinking.' " 



. II.— SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS ON SOUP STOCK AND SOUP MEAT, HOW 
TO PREPARE THEM, HOW TO ENRICH THEM, THICKENING SOUP, 
COLORING SOUP, FLAVORING SOUP, ETC. THIRTY-ONE RECIPES 

- FOR SOUPS AND INCIDENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

THE first and great essential to making good soup is 
stock, or good, firesh meat. To make stock, take the 
liquor left after boiling fresh meat, bones large or 
small, the large ones being cracked, that the marrow may 
be extracted, trimmings of meat, bones, and meat left over 
from a roast or broil, put any or all of these in a large pot 
or soup-kettle with water enough to cover them. Let them 
simmer slowly over a steady fire, keep the kettle covered, 
stir frequently, pour in now and then a cup of cold water, 
and skim off the scum. If it is fresh meat or bones, com- 
mence with cold water ; if cooked, with warm water. Bones 
are as useful as meat in making stock, as they furnish gela- 
tine. A quart of water is usually enough for a pound of 
meat. Six to eight hours will make stock fit for use. Let 
it stand over night, then skim off the fat, put the stock into 
an earthen jar, and it is ready for use. 

Fresh meat should be freed from all superfluous skin and 
fat, which make a soup greasy, rather than rich. 

The glutinous substance contained in the bones renders it 
important that they should be boiled with the meat, as they 
add to the strength and thickness of the soup. The meat, 
however, should be cut off the bone and divided into small 
pieces. Place in cold water over a gentle fire and boil by 
the long and slow process, that the essence of the meat may 

35 



36 THE HOUSE WIEES LIBRAE V. 

be drawn out thoroughly. When it comes to the boiHng 
point, throw in a httie salt to assist the scum to rise ; then 
skim carefully to prevent its becoming turbid. When no 
more scum accumulates, and the meat is softened so as to 
readily separate with the use of the fork, it should be 
strained, the vegetables put it, the seasoning done, and the 
necessary amount of hot water added if too much has boiled 
away. 

All soup meats are better boiled the day before using, so 
as to allow the grease to chill over night, when it can 
readily be removed before putting over the fire again. 

The following thickening is almost indispensable to all 
good soups : A tablespoonful or more of flour mixed to a 
smooth paste with a little water, and enriched with a tea- 
spoonful of butter, or good beef drippings well stirred in. 
If it be necessary to add water to a soup, always use boil- 
ing water, as cold water injures the flavor. If making a 
rich soup that requires catsup or wine, let either be added 
just before the soup is taken from the fire. 

Soup may be colored yellow by the use of grated car- 
rots ; red with the juice of tomatoes ; green with the juice 
of powdered spinach ; brown with carefully scorched flour, 
kept ready for use. Onions are thought by many to be a 
necessity in all soups — that their flavor must lurk some- 
where, either defined or undefined. Their flavor may be 
much improved if fried until nicely browned in hot butter 
before being added to the soup. Potatoes should never 
be boiled with soup, because they add nothing to its flavor 
and are themselves injured by the long cooking. They 
should be boiled separately, and then added. 

A most desirable quality in soup is that no one flavor 
predominate over the others, but, that by a careful blending 
of the different ingredients it shall contain and harmonize 
all flavors. Soups and broths should always be strained. It 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPSy ETC. 37 

makes them more relishable as well as inviting to the eye. 
A slight acid, like lemon or tomato, gives a peculiar relish 
to some soups, as do many of the palatable condiments 
prepared by such manufacturers as Durkee & Co., of New 
York, Annear & Co., of Philadelphia, and others, for this 
especial purpose. With such helps and a sufficient quan- 
tity of stock on hand, a choice, rich soup of any variety 
may be gotten up in thirty minutes. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a shin of beef, or a piece off the shoulder, 
slowly and thoroughly, the day before desiring to use it ; 
skim well the next day and thin the jelly, if necessary, with 
water ; add a little brandy, a grated carrot, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter rubbed smooth in brown flour, a little vermi- 
celli, and spices to taste. Two or three eggs may be boiled 
hard, mashed smooth, and placed in the tureen before 
turning in the soup. 

Beef Soup, No. 2. — Boil a shin of beef of moderate size, 
crack the bone, remove the tough outside skin, wash, and 
place in a kettle to boil with six or. eight quarts of water. 
Let it boil about four hours, until it becomes perfectly 
tender, then take it out of the liquid. Add salt, one pint of 
tomatoes, two onions cut in small pieces, two turnips cut in 
quarters, one grated carrot, one large tablespoonful of sugar, 
a little sweet marjoram and thyme rubbed fine, one red 
pepper cut in very small pieces, also a celery top or a small 
quantity of bruised celery seed. This soup may be thick- 
•ened according to taste either with vermicelli, macaroni, 
noodles, or drop dumplings. 

For an incidental side dish, take the soup meat that has 
been cut from the bones, chop fine while warm, season with 
salt and pepper, add one teacup of soup saved out before 



38 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

putting in the vegetables. Pack in a dish, and shce down 
for tea or lunch when cold. 

Beef Soup with Okra. — Cut a round steak in small pieces 
and fry in three tabiespoonfuls of butter, together with one 
sliced onion, until very brown ; put into a soup kettle with 
four quarts of cold water, and boil slowly an hour ; add 
salt, pepper, and one pint of sliced okra, and simmer three 
and one-half hours longer. Strain before serving. 

Corned Beef Soup. — When the liquor in which corned beef 
and vegetables have been boiled is cold, remove all the 
grease that has risen and hardened on the top, and add 
tomatoes and tomato catsup and boil half an hour — thus 
making an excellent tomato soup ; or add to it rice, or sago, 
or pearl barley, or turn it into a vegetable soup by boiling in 
the liquor any vegetables that are fancied. Several varieties 
of soups may have this stock for a basis and be agreeable 
to the taste. 

Ox-tail Soup. — Chop the ox-tail into small pieces ; set on 
the fire with a tablespoonful of butter, and stir until brown, 
and then pour off the fat ; add broth to taste, and boil gently 
until the pieces of tail are well cooked. Season with pepper, 
salt, and three or four tomatoes ; boil fifteen minutes and 
then serve. This soup can be made with water, instead of 
the stock broth, in which case season with carrot, onion, 
turnip, and parsley. 

Mutton Broth. — After the steaks have been cut from the 
leg, the lower part is just adapted for a soup. The neck- 
piece is also very nicei Boil the meat very gently in cold 
water, adding a turnip, a carrot, and a spoonful of rice. AH 
the fat should be removed. Toward the last, add a little 
minced parsley. Dumplings are an excellent addition. 

Vegetable Soup. — Take two pounds of shin of beef and two 
pounds of knuckle of veal ; remove all the fat and break 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. . 39 

the bones and take out the marrow ; put into a pot with five 
pints of water ; add a teaspoonful of salt, and then cover and 
let it come to a boil quickly ; remove the scum that rises, 
and set where it will simmer for five hours ; one hour before 
serving, add two young carrots, scraped and cut in slices, 
half a head of celery, and a small onion cut into squares ; in 
half an hour add one turnip sliced, and in fifteen minutes 
one cauliflower broken in small pieces. 

Bean Soup. — Soak one and a half pints of beans in cold 
water over night. In the morning drain off the water, wash 
the beans in fresh water, and put into soup-kettle with four 
quarts of good beef stock, from which all the fat has been 
removed. Set it where it will boil slowly but steadily for 
three hours at the least. Two hours before it is needed for 
use, slice in an onion and a carrot. Some think it im- 
proved by adding a little tomato. If the beans are not liked 
whole, strain through a colander and send to the table hot. 

Bla^k Bean Soup. — Three pounds soup bone, one quart 
black beans, soaked over night and drained ; one onion, 
chopped fine ; juice of one lemon. Pepper, salt, and Durkee's 
Challenge Sauce to taste. Boil the soup bone, beans, and 
onions together six- hours ; strain, and add seasoning. Slice 
lemon and put on top "when served. 

Tomato Soup. — Take a knuckle of veal, a bony piece of 
beef, a neck of mutton, or almost any piece of meat you 
may happen to have ; set it over the fire in a small quantity 
of water, cover it closely, and boil very gently, to extract 
the juices of the meat. When nearly done, add a quantity 
of peeled tomatoes, and stew till the tomatoes are done ; add 
salt and pepper to your taste. This is a very cheap, healthful, 
and easily made soup. 

Tomato Soup, No. 2. — Take one quart of tomatoes. When 
boiling, add one teaspoonful of soda, two pulverized soda 



40 .THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

crackers, one pint of hot water, one pint of milk, salt, and 
pepper ; strain through a colander and serve hot. 

Green Pea Soup. — Boil the empty pods of a half-peck of 
green peas in one gallon of water one hour ; strain them 
out ; add four pounds of beef cut into small pieces, and boil 
slowly for an hour and a half longer. Half an hour before 
serving add the shelled peas, and twenty minutes later half 
a cup of rice flour, salt, pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
After adding the rice flour stir frequently so as to pre- 
vent scorching. 

Dried Split Pea Soup. — One gallon of water, one quart of 
soaked split peas, half a pound of salt pork, one pound of 
beef. Put over the fire, seasoning with salt and pepper, 
celery salt, salpicant, curry powder, marjoram, or savory; 
let it boil slowly for two hours, or until the quantity of 
liquor does not exceed two quarts. Pour into a colander 
and press the peas through with a spoon. Fry two or three 
slices of stale bread in butter till brown, scatter them in the 
soup after it is placed in the tureen. 

Com Soup. — Cut the corn from the cob, and to a pint of 
corn allow one quart of hot water ; boil an hour and press 
through a colander; put into a saucepan an ounce of but- 
ter and a tables'poonful of flour, being careful to stir well to 
prevent it being lumpy; then add the corn pulp, a little 
cayenne pepper, salt, a pint of boiling milk, and half a pint 
of cream. 

Onion Soup. — Slice ten medium-sized onions and fry brown 
in butter with a tablespoonful and a half of flour ; put into a 
saucepan, and stir in slowly four or five pints of milk and 
water (about one-third water) ; season to taste, and add a 
teacupful of grated potato ; set in a ketde of boiling water, 
and cook ten minutes ; add a cup of sweet cream and serve 
quickly. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 41 

Mock-turtle Soup. — Scald a calf's head and wash it clean ; 
boil it in a large pot of water for half an hour, cut all the 
skin off, and take the tongue out. Take the broth made of 
a knuckle of veal, put in the tongue and skin, with one 
onion, half-ounce of cloves, half-ounce of mace, half a nut- 
meg, all kinds of sweet herbs chopped fine, and three 
anchovies. Stew till tender ; then take out the meat, and 
cut it in pieces two inches square; cut the tongue, previously- 
skinned, in slices ; strain the liquor through a sieve ; melt 
half a pound of butter in a stewpan ; put in it half a pound 
of flour and stir it till smooth — if at all lumpy, strain it ; add 
the liquor, stirring it all the time ; then put to the meat the 
juice of two lemons, or one bottle of Madeira wine, if pre- 
ferred ; season rather highly with pepper, salt, and cayenne 
pepper ; put in a few meat balls and eight eggs boiled hard. 
Stew gently one hour, and serve in a tureen ; if too thick, 
add more liquor before stewing the last time. 

Mock-turtle Soup, No. 2. — Take a calf's head and about 
two pounds of delicate fat pork. Put both into a soup- 
kettle, with two onions, sweet herbs, celery, pepper, and 
mace. Fill the kettle with water, and boil very gently till 
the meat is tender. Take out the head and the pork, return 
the bones of the head into the soup ; let it stew several 
hours longer ; and, when cold, take off the fat, strain the 
soup, and thicken ; add the juice of a lemon and half a pint 
of white wine. Cut up the head and pork into pieces ; warm 
them up in the soup, adding some choice meat balls made 
from finely minced, savory meat. The pork will be found 
quite an addition to the soup and a substitute for the fat of 
the turtle. 

Gumbo Soup. — Cut up two chickens, two slices of ham, and 
two onions into dice ; flour them, and fry the whole to a 
light brown ; then fill the frying-pan with boiling water, stir 



42 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRA R Y. 

it a few minutes, and turn the whole into a saucepan con- 
taining tliree quarts of boiling water ; let it boil forty min- 
utes, removing the scum. In the meantime soak three pods 
of okra in cold water twenty minutes ; cut them into thin 
slices, and add to the other ingredients ; let it boil one hour 
and a half Add a quart of canned tomatoes and a cupful 
of boiled rice half an hour before serving. 

Southern Gumbo Soup. — Cut up one chicken, and fry it to 
a light brown, also two slices of bacon ; pour on them three 
quarts of boiling water ; add one onion and some sweet 
herbs tied in a bag ; simmer them gently three hours and a 
half; strain off the liquor, take off the fat, and then put the 
ham and chicken (cut into small pieces) into the liquor; 
add half a teacup of sliced okra, also half a teacup of boiled 
rice. Boil all half an hour, and just before serving add a 
glass of wine and a dozen oysters with their juice. 

Julienne Soup. — Scrape two carrots and two turnips, and 
cut in pieces an inch long ; cut slices lengthwise about one- 
eighth of an inch thick ; then cut again, so as to make 
square strips ; put them in a saucepan, with two ounces of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of cabbage chopped fine, and 
half an onion chopped ; set on the fire and stir until half 
fried ; add broth as you wish to make thick or thin ; boil 
until done ; salt to taste ; skim off the fat, and serve ; it 
takes about two hours to prepare this soup properly. It 
can be served with rice or barley. 

Macaroni or Vermicelli Soup. — Two small carrots, four 
onions, two turnips, two cloves, one tablespoonful salt, pep- 
per to taste. Herbs — marjoram, parsley, and thyme. Put 
any cooked or uncooked meat and its bones in enough water 
to cover them ; when they boil, skim them and add the 
vegetables. Simmer three or four hours, then strain 
through a colander and put back in the saucepan to reheat. 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 43 

Boil one-half pound macaroni until quite tender, and place 
in the soup tureen, and pour the soup over it — the last 
thing. Vermicelli will need to be soaked a short time only — 
not to be boiled. 

White Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal for three hours. Add 
a quarter of a pound of macaroni, and when done, a pint of 
cream. Season with lemon-peel and mace. 

Turkey Soup. — Take the turkey bones and boil three- 
quarters of an hour in water enough to cover them ; add a 
little summer savory and celery chopped fine. Just before 
serving, thicken with a little browned flour, and season 
with pepper, salt, and a small piece of butter. 

CMcken Soup. — To the broth in which chickens have been 
boiled for salad, etc., add one onion and eight or ten 
tomatoes ; season with pepper and salt ; add Challenge Sauce 
or Salpicant, if desired ; boil thirty minutes ; add two well- 
beaten eggs just before sending to the table. 

Lobster Soup. — To boil a lobster, put it in a fish-kettle and 
cover it with cold water, cooking it on a quick fire. Remove 
the small bladder found near the head, and take out a small 
vein found immediately under the shell all along the back 
of the lobster, and use the rest. Two lobsters will make 
soup for six or eight persons, and salad also. All the under 
shell and small claws are pounded in a mortar to make the 
soup ; when pounded, put it into a pan and set it on the fire 
with broth or water. The meat is cut in small pieces, to 
be added afterward. The soup is left on the fire to boil 
gently for half an hour ; then put it in a sieve and press it 
with a masher to extract the juice. To make it thicker, a 
small piece of parsnip can be added and mashed with the 
rest into a pan, so that all the essence is extracted in that way 
from the lobster. When you have strained it put a little 



44 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

butter with it and add as much broth as is required ; put 
some of the meat in the tureen and pour the soup over it. 

Clam Soup. — Wash the clams free from grit; boil them in 
a pint of water till they will come from the shells easily. 
Take a small quantity of the liquor, add some milk, thicken 
it with a little flour, and add the clams. Split crackers are 
very nice added. 

Portable Soup. — Boil a knuckle of veal, also the feet, a 
shin of beef, a cowheel or any other bones of meat which 
will produce a stiff jelly, in a large kettle, with as much 
water as will cover them. Let it stand a long time over the 
fire before it boils. Skim it most thoroughly, until the 
broth appears entirely clear. Then fill up the kettle with 
hot water, and boil it eight hours, or until it has evaporated 
so as to be somewhat thick. Run it through a hair sieve, 
set it in a cool place where it will harden very quickly. Skim 
off every particle of fat, and return it to a saucepan ; skim 
and stir continually, so that it may not scorch, and all the 
previous labor be lost, until it becomes a very thick syrup. 
As soon as it can be no longer done in this way, transfer it 
to a deep jar, and set into a kettle of water, hot, but not 
boiling, until it jellies very thick. This will keep good 
many months, if packed dry in tin canisters. This is the con- 
centrated essence of soup, and is a most convenient article 
of use, either at home in an emergency or in traveling, and 
especially at sea. To make a pint of soup, cut off a piece 
as large as a walnut, dissolve it in the boiling water, and it 
is ready for use. 

Fluid Beef. — Among the advanced preparations of the day 
meat extracts are taking a high place. One of the finest of 
these preparations is " Johnston's Fluid Beef" It contains 
all the nutritive constituents of the beef, and is readily 
available for soups, sandwiches, beef tea, etc. For medi- 
cal uses, traveling, picnics, etc,, it is very convenient. To 



SOUP STOCK, SOUPS, ETC. 45 

use for soups and beef tea, add a teaspoonful to a cup of 
boiling water and season to taste ; or as a sandwich paste, 
it may be used on toast, with or without butter. Put up 
in cans of various sizes, from two ounces to one pound, 
which can be left open without injury to contents. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO SOUPS. 

Meat Balls for Soup. — Take fresh cooked meat or fowl and 
chop fine ; season with pepper, salt, and herbs, and a little 
lemon ; mix together with an Qgg ; roll in bread-crumbs, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Browned Flour for Soups.-^Dredge the bottom of a spider 
well with flour, and shake it over hot coals, letting it brown 
gradually, but not burn. Keep it in a dry place, in a tin 
canister, without wholly closing the lid. It is very con- 
venient to have it already prepared, although when used fresh 
it is much nicer. 

Home-made Noodles — a substitute for VermicellL — Wet with 
the yelks of four eggs as much fine, dry, sifted flour as will 
make them into a firm but very smooth paste. Roll it out 
as thin as possible, and cut it into bands of about an inch 
and a quarter in width. Dust them lightly with flour, and 
place four of them one upon the other. Cut them in the 
finest possible strips, separate them with the point of a 
knife, and spread them on the pie-board so that they may 
dry a little before they are used. Drop them gradually into 
the boiling soup, and in five minutes they will be done. 

Drop Dumplings. — Take prepared flour, add a little beef 
drippings or lard, well rubbed through, and moisten to a soft 
dough. With floured hands pinch off very small pieces and 
form into balls by rolling in the palm of the hand. In boil- 
ing dumplings of any kind, put them in the water one at a 
time. If they are put in together they will blend with each 
other. 



III.— FISH, OYSTERS, Etc. 

HINTS CONCERNING FISH — TESTS OF FRESHNESS, HOW TO CLEAN, 
HOW TO DRESS, HOW TO BOIL FISH, HOW TO BAKE FISH, 
HOW TO BROIL FISH, HOW TO FRY FISH, ETC. FIFTY-THREE 
RECIPES FOR COOKING FISH, OYSTERS, ETC., AND FOR INCI- 
DENTAL PREPARATIONS. 

FISH should be eaten as soon as possible after being 
taken from the water. In every kind of fish, the 
brightness of the eyes, redness of the gills, firmness 
of the flesh, and stiffness of the fins are indications of fresh- 
ness. Fish should be thoroughly cleaned as soon as prac- 
ticable. Great care should be taken to remove every atom 
of blood, to rinse carefully, and not to soak them longer 
than necessary. Fish are dressed in a variety of ways to 
suit different tastes — boiled, baked, broiled, and fried. The 
most ordinary methods are broiling or frying. In boiling, 
large fish should be wrapped in a cloth previously floured 
to prevent sticking, tied with a string, and covered with 
from two to three inches of cold water already salted ; from 
six to ten minutes per pound will generally be found suf- 
ficient for boiling. Remove from the fire the moment it is 
done, and place upon a sieve to drain. 

In baking fish, cleanse and wipe dry ; fill to taste ; sew to- 
gether ; place in a dripping-pan ; season with salt and pepper ; 
add sufficient water to baste with, or if a filling of oysters 
is used, baste with the liquor off them. The space between 
the fish and the sides of the pan may be filled with slices of 
raw potatoes one-quarter of an inch thick, and serve fish 
and potatoes together. A large fish will bake in an hour. 

46 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 47 

For broiling, thoroughly cleanse and dry ; split open so 
that the backbone will be flat in the middle ; season with salt 
and pepper, and place on a buttered gridiron over a clear 
fire with the inside downward until it begins to brown, then 
turn over. When done, serve on a hot dish and butter lib- 
erally. 

Fish may be very nicely fried in hot lard with only a 
seasoning of salt and pepper, and a little flour dredged 
over it, or it may be spread with beaten eggs and rolled in 
cracker or bread crumbs before frying. Challenge sauce, 
Worcestershire sauce, and similar condiments upon fish will 
be found to give a most delicate and piquant flavoring. 



RECIPES. 

Broiled Shad. — Scrape, split, wash, and dry the shad on a 
cloth; season with pepper and salt; grease the gridiron 
well ; as soon as it is hot lay the shad on to broil with the 
inside downward. One side being well browned, turn it. 
It should broil a quarter of an hour or more, according to 
thickness. Butter well and send to table hot. 

Baked Shad. — Many people are of the opinion that the 
very best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. Stuff it 
with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, and parsley, and 
mix this up with beaten yelk of ^gg ; fill the fish with it, 
and sew it up or fasten a string around it. Pour over it a 
little water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. 
A shad will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter 
to bake. 

Halibut Cutlets. — Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, 
wipe them with a dry cloth, and season with salt and cay- 
enne pepper. Have ready a pan of yelk of eggs well 
beaten and a dish of grated bread-crumbs. Put some fresh 



48 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

lard or beef drippings in a frying-pan and hold it over the 
fire till it boils. Dip your cutlets in the ^^'g, and then in 
the bread-crumbs. Fry a light brown ; serve up hot. 
Salmon or any large fish may be fried in the same manner. 

Baked Cod or Halibut. — Use a piece of fish from the middle 
of the back, weighing four, five, or six pounds. Lay the fish 
in very cold salt-and-water for two hours ; wipe dry ; make 
deep gashes in both sides at right angles with the back- 
bone, and rub into these, as well as coat it all over with, a 
force-meat made of the crumbs, pork, herbs, onion, and 
seasoning, made to adhere by raw ^g%. Lay in the baking- 
pan and pour over it the drawn butter (which should be quite 
thin), season with the anchovy sauce, lemon juice, pepper, 
and a pinch of parsley. Bake in a moderate oven nearly an 
hour — or even more if the piece be large — basting frequently 
lest it should brown too fast. Add a little butter-and-water 
when the sauce thickens too much. When the fish is done, 
remove to a hot dish, and strain the gravy over it. A few 
capers or chopped green pickles are a pleasant addition to 
the gravy. 

Boiled Halibut. — Take a small halibut, or what you require 
from a large fish. Put it into the fish-kettle, with the back 
of the fish undermost ; cover it with cold water, in which a 
handful of salt and a bit of saltpetre the size of a hazel-nut 
have been dissolved. When it begins to boil skim it care- 
fully, and then let it just simmer till it is done. Four pounds 
of fish will require half an hour nearly to boil it. Drain it, 
garnish with horse-radish or parsley. Egg sauce, or plain 
melted butter, are served with it. 

Boiled Rockfisll. — After the fish has been nicely cleaned, 
put it into a pot v/ith water enough to cover it, and throw 
in salt in the proportion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of 
fish. Boil it slowly until the meat is tender and easily sep- 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 49 

arates from the bones. A large fish will require an hour to 
cook. When done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, laid around it and over, 
it. Eat with egg-sauce. 

Wliite FisL — This fish may be broiled, fried, or baked. 
To bake it, prepare a stuffing of fine bread-crumbs, a little 
salt pork chopped very fine ; season with sage, parsley, pep- 
per, and salt. Fill the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, 
sprinkle the outside with salt, pepper, and flour, and bake. 
In frying white fish, pour off the fat as it accumulates, as it 
is apt to be too fat when served. 

Broiled Salmon. — The steaks from the centre of the fish 
are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little 
butter, and broil over a clear but slow fire. 

Smoked Salmon, Broiled. — Take a half pound of smoked 
salmon and parboil it ten minutes ; lay in cold water for the 
same length of time ; wipe dry and broil over a clear fire. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter while hot ; season with 
cayenne and the juice of half a lemon; pile in a "log- 
cabin " square upon a hot plate, and serve with dry toast. 

Boiled Salmon. — A piece weighing six pounds should be 
rubbed with salt, tied carefully in a cloth, and boiled slowly 
for three-quarters of an hour. It should be eaten with ^^^ or 
caper sauce. If any remain after dinner, it may be placed 
in a deep dish, a little salt sprinkled over, and a teacupful of 
boiling vinegar poured upon it. Cover it closely, and it will 
make a nice breakfast dish. 

Baked Salmon with Cream Sauce. — Butter a sheet of fools- 
cap paper on both sides, and wrap the fish up in it, pinning 
the ends securely together. Lay in the baking-pan, and 
pour six or seven spoonfuls of butter-and-water over it. 
Turn another pan over all, and steam in a moderate oven 

4 



50 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR Y. 

from three-quarters of an hour to an hour, lifting the cover, 
from time to time, to baste and assure yourself that the 
paper is not burning. Meanwhile, have ready in a sauce- 
pan a cup of cream, in which you would do well to dis- 
solve a bit of soda a little larger than a pea. This is a wise 
precaution whenever cream is to be boiled. Heat this in a 
vessel placed within another of hot water ; thicken with a 
heaping teaspoonful of corn-starch ; add a tablespoonful of 
butter, pepper and salt to taste, a liberal pinch of minced 
parsley, and when the fish is unwrapped and dished, pour 
half the dressing slowly over it, sending the rest to table 
in a boat. If you have no cream, use milk, and add a beaten 
^gg to the thickening. 

Salmon Steaks or Cutlets Pried. — Cut slices from the middle 
of the fish one inch thick ; wipe dry, and salt slightly ; dip 
in ^%^y then in cracker crumbs ; fry very quickly in hot 
butter ; drain off every drop of grease, and serve upon a hot 
dish. Sprinkle green parsley in bunches over it. The 
French use the best salad-oil in this recipe instead of butter. 

Pickled Salmon. — Soak salt salmon twenty-four hours, 
changing the water frequently ; afterward pour boiling water 
around it, and let it stand fifteen minutes ; drain off and 
then pour on boiling vinegar with cloves and mace added. 

Pried Perch. — Scale and clean them perfectly ; dry them 
well, flour and fry them in boiling lard. Serve plenty of 
fried parsley round them. 

Pried Trout. — Wash, drain, and split ; roll in flour, season 
with salt; have some thin slices of salt pork in a pan, and 
when very hot put in the fish and fry to a nice brown. 

Stewed Trout. — Clean and wash the fish with care, and 
wipe it perfectly dry ; put into a stewpan two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, dredge in as it melts a little flour, grate half a 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 51 

nutmeg, a few blades of mace, a little cayenne, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt ; mix it all together ; then lay in the fish, let 
it brown slightly; pour over some veal gravy, a lemon 
thinly sliced ; stew very slowly for forty minutes ; take out 
the fish, and add two glasses of wine to the gravy. Lay 
the fish on a hot dish, and pour over it some of the gravy. 
Serve the rest in a sauce-tureen. 

Fried Catfish. — Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — if pos- 
sible, directly out of the water. The larger ones are gener- 
ally coarse and strong ; the small-sized fish are the best. 
Wash and clean them, cut off their heads and tails, remove 
the upper part of the backbone near the shoulders, and 
score them along the back with deep gashes or incisions. 
Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty of lard, 
boiling fast when the catfish are put into the pan. Or you 
may fry them in the drippings or gravy saved from roast 
beef or veal. They are very nice dipped in a batter of 
beaten ^^^ and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be done 
plain, though not in so nice a way, with Indian meal instead 
of bread-crumbs. Drain off the lard before you dish them. 
Touch each incision or cut very slightly with a little cay- 
enne before they go to table. 

Pried Eels. — After skinning, emptying, and washing them 
as clean as possible, cut them into short pieces, and dry 
them well with a soft cloth. Season them with fine salt 
and cayenne, flour them thickly, and fry them in boiling 
lard ; when nicely browned, drain and dry them, and send 
to the table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or with 
fish-sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped into batter and then 
fried, or into ^^g and dried bread-crumbs, and served with 
plenty of crisped parsley. 

Pish Chowder. — Take a fresh haddock, of three or four 
pounds, clean it well, and cut in pieces of three inches 



52 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

square. Place in the bottom of your dinner-pot five or six 
slices of salt pork, fry brown, then add three onions sliced 
thin, and fry those brown. Remove the kettle from the fire, 
and place on the onions and pork a layer of fish. Sprinkle 
over a little pepper and salt, then a layer of pared and sliced 
potatoes, a layer of fish and potatoes, till the fish is used up. 
Cover with water, and let it boil for half an hour. Pound 
six biscuits or crackers fine as meal, and pour into the pot ; 
and, lastly, add a pint of milk ; let it scald well, and serve. 

New England Chowder. — Take a good haddock, cod, or any 
other solid fish, cut it in pieces three inches square ; put a 
pound of fat, salt pork, cut into strips, into the pot; set it 
on hot coals and fry out the grease ; take out the pork, but 
leave the grease in the bottom of the pot, and put in a layer 
of fish, over that a layer of sliced onions, over that a layer 
of fish, with slips of the fried pork, then another layer of 
onions and a few sliced raw potatoes, and so on alternately 
until your fish is all in ; mix some flour with as much water 
as will fill the pot ; season to suit your taste, and boil for 
half an hour ; have ready some pilot bread, soaked in water, 
and throw them into your chowder five minutes before tak- 
ing off; serve in a tureen. 

Fish-balls. — Two cupfuls cold boiled codfish, fresh or 
salted. Chop the fish when you have freed it of bones and 
skin ; work in one cupful of mashed potatoes, and moisten 
with a half cup of drawn butter with an ^^g beaten in. Sea- 
son to taste. Have them soft enough to mold, yet firm 
enough to keep in shape. Roll the balls in flour, and fry 
quickly to a golden-brown in lard or clean dripping. Take 
from the fat so soon as they are done ; lay in a colander or 
sieve and shake gently, to free them from every drop of 
grease. Turn out for moment on white paper to absorb any 
lingering drops, and serve on a hot dish. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 53 

Stewed Oysters. — Take one quart of oysters ; put the liquor 
(a teacupful for three persons) in a stewpan, and add half as 
much more water, salt and pepper to taste, and let it boil. 
Have your oysters ready in a bowl, and the moment the 
liquor boils, pour in all your oysters, say ten for each per- 
son, or six will do. Now, watch carefully, and as soon as 
it begins to boil take out your watch, count just thirty 
seconds, and take your oysters from the stove. You will 
have your big dish ready, with one and a half tablespoonfuls 
of cream or milk for each person. Pour your stew on this 
and serve immediately. Never boil an oyster in milk. 

Maryland Stewed Oysters. — Put the juice into a saucepan 
and let it simmer, skimming it carefully ; then rub the yelks 
of three hard-boiled eggs and one large spoonful of flour 
well together, and stir into the juice. Cut in small pieces 
quarter of a pound of butter, half a teaspoonful of whole 
allspice, a little salt, a little cayenne, and the juice of a fresh 
lemon; let all simmer ten minutes, and just before dishing 
add the oysters. This is for two quarts of oysters. 

Panned Oysters. — Have ready several small pans of block 
tin, with upright sides. Cut stale bread in thin slices, then 
round them to a size that will just fit in the bottoms of your 
pans. Toast these quickly to a light brown, butter, and lay 
within your tins. Wet with a great spoonful of oyster liquid, . 
then, with a silver fork, arrange upon the toast as many oys- 
ters as the pans will hold without heaping them up. Dust 
with pepper and salt, put a bit of butter on top, and set the 
pans, when all are full, upon the floor of a quick oven. Cover 
with an inverted baking-pan to keep in steam and flavor, 
and cook until the oysters " ruffle." Eight minutes in a 
brisk oven should be enough. Send very hot to the table 
in tins in which they were roasted. Next to roasting in the 
shell, this mode of cooking oysters best preserves their 
native flavor. 



54 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

Roasted Oysters. — Take oysters in the shell; wash the 
shells clean, and lay them on hot coals ; when they are done 
they will begin to open. Remove the upper shell, and serve 
the oysters in the lower shell, with a little melted butter 
poured over each, and season to taste. 

Oyster Toast. — Select fifteen plump oysters ; mince them, 
and season with mixed pepper and a pinch of nutmeg ; beat 
the yelks of four eggs and mix them with half a pint of 
cream. Put the whole into a saucepan and set it over the 
fire to simmer till thick ; stir it well, and do not let it boil, 
lest it should curdle. Toast five pieces of bread, and butter 
them ; when your dish is near the boiling-point, remove it 
from the fire and pour it over the toast. 

Cream Oysters.— Fifty shell oysters, one quart sweet cream ; 
butter, pepper, and salt to suit taste. Put the cream and 
oysters in separate kettles to heat, the oysters in their own 
liquor, and let them come to a boil; when sufficiently 
cooked, skim ; then take them out of the liquid and put 
them into a dish to keep warm. Put the cream and 
liquid together. Season to taste, and thicken with powdered 
cracker. When sufficiently thick, stir in the oysters. 

Broiled Oysters. — Drain select oysters in a colander. Dip 
them one by one into melted butter, to prevent sticking to 
the gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron. Broil over 
a clear fire. When nicely browned on both sides, season 
with salt, pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay them on hot 
buttered toast, moistened with a little hot water. Serve 
very hot Oysters cooked in this way and served on broiled 
beefsteak are delicious. 

Fried Oysters. — Select the largest and finest fresh oysters, 
put them into a colander and pour over a little water to 
rinse them ; then place them on a clean towel and dry them. 
Have ready some grated bread-crumbs, seasoned with 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 55 

pepper and salt, and plenty of yelk of ^^^ beaten till very 
light ; and to each ^^^ allow a large teaspoonful of rich 
cream or of the best fresh butter. Beat the ^^'g and cream 
together. Dip each oyster first into the ^gg and cream, 
and then into the crumbs. Repeat this twice, until the 
oysters are well coated all over. Have ready boiling, in a 
frying-pan, an equal mixture of fresh butter and lard. It 
must very nearly fill the frying-pan, and be boiling fast when 
the oysters go in, otherwise they will be heavy and greasy. 
Fry them of a yellow brown on both sides, and serve hot. 

Oyster Salad, see Salads. 

Spiced or Pickled Oysters. — Put into a porcelain, kettle one 
hundred and fifty large oysters with the liquor ; add salt, 
and simmer till the edges roll or curl ; skim them out ; add 
to the liquor one pint of white wine vinegar, one dozen 
blades mace, three dozen cloves, and three dozen pepper- 
corns ; let it come to a boil, and pour over the oysters. 
Serve with slices of lemon floating in saucer. 

Oyster Omelette. — Allow for every six large oysters or 
twelve small ones one ^gg ; remove the hard part and mince 
the rest very fine ; take the yelks of eight eggs and whites of 
four, beat till very light, then mix in the oysters ; season and 
beat up thoroughly ; put into a skillet a gill of butter, let it 
melt ; when the butter boils, skim it and turn in the ome- 
lette ; stir until it stiffens ; fry light brown ; when the under 
side is brown, turn on to a hot platter. To brown the upper 
side, hold a red-hot shovel over it. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 1. — Open the shells, setting aside for 
use the deepest ones. Have ready some melted butter, not 
hot, seasoned with minced parsley and pepper. Roll each 
oyster in this, letting it drip as little as may be, and lay iil 
the shells,which should be arranged in a baking-part. Add 



56 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

tc each a little lemon juice, sift bread-crumbs over it, and 
bake in a quick oven until done. Serve in the shells. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 2. — Cover the bottom of a baking- 
dish (well buttered) with a layer of crumbs, and wet these 
with cream, put on spoonful by spoonful. Pepper and salt, 
and strew with minute bits of butter. Next, put in the oys- 
ters, with a little of their liquor. Pepper them, stick bits of 
butter in among them, and cover with dry crumbs until the 
oysters are entirely hidden. Add more pieces of butter, very 
small, and arrange thickly on top. ' Set in the oven, invert 
a plate over it to keep in the flavor, and bake until the juice 
bubbles up to the top. Remove the cover, and brown on 
the upper grating for two or three minutes. Serve in the 
bake-dish. 

Oyster Pie. — Line a dish with a puff paste or a rich bis- 
cuit paste, and dredge well with flour ; drain one quart of 
oysters ; season with pepper, salt, and butter, and pour into 
the dish ; add some of the liquor ; dredge with flour, and 
cover with a top crust, leaving a small opening in the 
centre. Bake in a quick oven. 

Oyster Patties. — Put one quart of oysters in a saucepan, 
with liquor enough to cover them, set it on the stove and 
let them come to a boil ; skim well, and stir in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, a little pepper, and salt. Line some 
patty-pans with puff-paste, fill with oysters, cover with paste, 
and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. The upper crust 
may be omitted, if desired. 

Oyster Macaroni. — Boil macaroni in a cloth to keep it 
straight. Put a layer in a dish seasoned with pepper, salt, 
and butter, then a layer of oysters, until the dish is full. 
Mix some grated bread with a beaten ^%%, spread over the 
top, and bake. 

Oyster Sauce, see Sauces. 



FISH, OYSTERS, ETC. 57 

Boiled Lobster. — If purchased alive, lobsters should be 
chosen by weight (the heaviest are the best) and their live- 
liness and briskness of motion. When freshly boiled they 
are stiff, and their tails turn .strongly inward; when the fish 
appear soft and watery, they are stale. The flesh of the 
male lobster is generally considered of the finest flavor for 
eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for sauce and soups, 
on account of the coral. 

To properly boil lobsters, throw them living into a kettle 
of fast-boiling salt and water, that life may be destroyed in 
an instant. Let them boil for about half an hour. When 
done, take them out of the kettle, wipe them clean, and rub 
the shell with a little salad-oil, which will give a clear red 
appearance. Crack the large claws without mashing them, 
and with a sharp knife split the body and tail from end to 
end. The head, which is never eaten, should also be sepa- 
rated from the body, but laid so near it that the division is 
almost imperceptible. Dress in any way preferred. 

Deviled Lobster. — Procure a live, heavy lobster ; put it in 
a pot of boiling water, with a handful of salt to it. When 
done and cold, take out all the meat carefully, putting the 
fat and coral on separate plates; cut the meat in small 
pieces, rub the coral to a paste ; stir the fat in it, with a little 
salt, cayenne, chopped parsley, essence of anchovies, and 
salad-oil, or melted butter and lemon juice ; cut the back of 
the lobster-shell in two, lengthwise ; wash clean ; stir the 
lobster and sauce well together; fill the shells; sprinkle 
bread-crumbs and a few bits of butter over the top; set in 
the oven until the crumbs are brown. 

Stewed Lobster. — A middling-sized lobster is best; pick 
all the meat from the shells and mince it fine; season with 
u little salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg ; add three or four 
spoonfuls of rich gravy and a small bit of butter. If you 



58 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



have no gravy, use more butter and two spoonfuls of 
vinegar ; stew about twenty minutes. 

Lobster Salad, see Salads. 
Lobster Croquettes, see Croquettes. 
Lobster Sauce, see Sauces. 

Lobster Patties. — Proceed as in oyster patties, but use the 
meat of a cold boiled lobster. 

Terrapins. — Put the terrapins into a pot of boiling water, 
where they must remain until they are quite dead. You 
then divest them of their outer skin and toe-nails ; and, 
after washing them in warm water, boil thern again until 
they become quite tender, adding a handful of salt to the 
water. Having satisfied yourself of their being perfectly 
tender, take off the shells and clean the terrapins very care- 
fully, removing the sandbag and gall without by any means 
breaking them. Then cut the meat into small pieces and put 
into a saucepan, adding the juice which has been given out 
in cutting them up, but no water, and season with salt, cay- 
enne, and black pepper to your taste, adding a quarter of 
a pound of good butter for each terrapin and a handful of 
flour for thickening. After stirring a short time, add four 
or five tablespoonfuls of cream, and a half pint of good 
Maderia to every four terrapins, and serve hot in a deep 
dish. A very little mace may be added and a large table- 
spoonful of mustard; just before serving, add the yelks of 
four hard-boiled eggs. During the stewing, particular 
attention must be paid to stirring the preparation frequently ; 
and terrapins cannot possibly be served too hot. 

Mock Terrapin.— Take half a calf's liver, season and fry it 
brown ; chop it into dice, not too small ; flour it thickly, 
and add a teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a little cayenne 
pepper, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a lump of but-

ter the size of an ^gg, and a teacupful of water. Let it boil 
a minute or two. Cold veal will do as well as liver. 

Scalloped Crabs. — Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling 
water, and throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty- 
minutes to half an hour. Take them from the water when 
done and pick out all the meat ; be careful not to break the 
shell. To a pint of meat put a little salt and pepper ; taste, 
and if not enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. 
Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoonful of 
cracker or bread crumbs, two eggs well beaten, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter (even full) ; stir all well together ; 
wash the shells clean, and fill each shell full of the mixture ; 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with butter, then 
bake until nicely browned on top. 

Soffc-sheU Crabs. — Season with pepper and salt; roll in 
flour, then in ^%'g, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard. Serve hot with rich condiments. 

Stewed Clams. — Chop the clams and season with pepper 
and salt; put in a saucepan butter the size of an ^^g, and 
when melted add a teaspoonful of flour; add slowly the 
clam liquor and then the clams, and cook three minutes ; 
then add half a pint of cream, and serve. 

Deviled Clams. — Chop fifty clams very fine ; take two 
tomatoes, one onion chopped equally fine, a little parsley, 
thyme, and sweet marjoram, a little salt, pepper, and bread- 
crumbs, adding the juice of the clams until the mixture is 
of the consistency of sausage ; put it in the shells with a 
lump of butter on each ; cover with bread-crumbs, and bake 
one-half hour. . 

Clam Chowder, — Forty-five clams chopped, one quart of 
sliced potatoes, one-half pint sliced onions. Cut a few slices 
salt pork, fry to a crisp, chop fine. Put in kettle a little fat

from the pork, a layer of potatoes, clams, onions, a little pep- 
per and salt ; another layer of chopped pork, potatoes, etc, 
until all are in. Pour over all the juice of the clams. Cook 
three hours, being careful not to burn. Add a teacupful of 
milk just before serving. 

Scallops. — Wipe dry; dip separately into seasoned ^%%, 
then into cracker dust, and fry in hot lard. 

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO FISH. 

Bread Stuffing for Fish. — Take about half a pound of stale 
bread and soak in water, and when soft press out the water; 
add a very little chopped suet, pepper, salt, a large table- 
spoonful of onion minced and fried, and, if preferred, a little 
minced parsley ; cook a trifle, and after removing from the 
fire add a beaten ^%%. 

Bread Stuffing, No. 2. — Bread-crumbs with a little chopped 
parsley and pork, salt, pepper, and butter. Fill up the fish, 
sew it closely, then bake. 

Cleaning a Shad. — Scale and scrape it carefully; split it 
down the back and remove the contents, reserving the roe 
or melt. Wash well and cook as desired. 

Soaking Salt Fish. — Very salt fish should be soaked several 
hours in three or four changes of warm water. Place the 
skin side up, so that salt crystals may fall away from the 
under or meat side. Wipe carefully and clean, then soak 
for an hour in very cold water. 

Fish in Season. — As a rule, fish are in best condition just 
before they spawn, and many are so while they are full of 
roe, as smelts, mackerel, and shad. As soon as spawning is 
over, they become unfit for food, some of them becoming 
positively unwholesome. In season, the flesh is firm and it 
boils white ; when it boils to a bluish hue, the fish are not 
in season, or are stale. 



IV.— POULTRY AND GAME. 

GENERAL REMARKS ON POULTRY AND GAME — HOW TO SELECT, 
PREPARATION FOR BOILING, FOR ROASTING, ETC. THIRTY-ONE 
RECIPES FOR POULTRY AND GAME. 

POULTRY should invariably be selected young, plump, 
and well fed, but not too fat. If old and tough, fowls 
are never as savory when cooked as if they be young 
and tender. This applies especially to ducks and geese. The 
flesh of young fowls will be firm and fleshy to the touch, 
and heavy in proportion to their size ; the skin should be 
clear, white, and finely grained, the toes pliable and easily 
broken when bent back, the end of the breast-bone also 
pliable. All kinds of poultry, turkeys especially, are im- 
proved by hanging a day. or two, unless the weather should 
be exceedingly sultry. Dark-legged fowls are best for 
roasting, while the white-legged ones should be chosen for 
boiling. 

In preparing fowls for boiling, some persons soak fowls 
an hour or two in skimmed-milk and then sew them in a 
floured cloth. This tends to preserve them of a nice color, 
but it may be dispensed with by carefully skimming them 
while over the fire. 

In dressing poultry, care should be taken not to break the 
gall ; a thorough cleansing in every part also is necessary. 
The hairs should be singed off with a well-lighted piece of 
paper> holding the fowl before a hot fire. All the pin- 
feathers should be carefully and entirely removed, as also 
the oil-bag at the end of the back. The legs should be cut 
off at the first joint next to the feet. The inside should be

washed and rinsed several times in cold water, after every- 
thing has been removed. Remove extra fat, as it tends to 
make the gravy greasy. The heart should be slit open 
and cleansed, also the gizzard, and both should be put by 
themselves to soak in water. 

Roasted or broiled poultry of all kinds should be thor- 
oughly cooked and handsomely browned. It is not easy to 
state exactly the time required for the different sorts to be 
well done. Experience and practice are the only sure 
guides. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Turkey. — A young turkey, weighing not more than 
eight or nine pounds, is the best. Wash and clean thor- 
oughly, wiping dry, as moisture will spoil the stuffing. 
Take one small loaf of bread grated fine, rub into it a piece 
of butter the size of an ^^g, one small teaspoonful of pep- 
per and one of salt; a sprinkling of sweet marjoram, sum- 
mer savory, or sage, if liked. Rub all together, and fill the 
turkey, sewing up so that the stuffing cannot cook out. 
Always put the giblets under the side of the fowl, so they 
will not dry up. Rub salt, pepper, and butter on the out- 
side ; put into dripping-pan with one teacupful of water, 
basting often, turning the fowl till brown all over ; bake 
about two hours ; take out the giblets and chop fine. After 
taking out the turkey, put a large tablespoonful of flour into 
the pan and stir until brown. Put the giblets into a gravy- 
boat, and pour over them the gravy. 

Boiled Turkey. — Stuff the turkey as for roasting. A very 
nice dressing is made by chopping half a pint of oysters 
and mixing them with bread-crumbs, butter, pepper* salt, 
thyme, and wet with milk or water. Baste about the turkey 
a thin cloth, the inside of which has been dredged with 
flour, and put it to boil in cold water with a teaspoonful of salt 



POULTRY AND GAME, 63; 

in it. Let a large turkey simmer for three hours ; skim 
while boiling. Serve with oyster sauce, made by adding to 
a cupful of the liquor in which the turkey was boiled the 
same quantity of milk and eight oysters chopped fine ; sea- 
son with minced parsley ; stir in a spoonful of rice or wheat 
flour wet with cold milk ; a tablespoonful of butter. Boil 
up once and pour into a tureen. 

Boned Turkey. — Boil a large tu-rkey in as little water as 
possible until the meat falls from the bones ; remove all the 
bones and skin ; pick the meat into small pieces, and mix 
dark and light together ; season with pepper and salt ; put 
into a mold and pour over it the liquor, which must be kept 
warm, and press with a heavy weight. 

Roast CMcken. — Having selected your chickens in view of 
the foregoing hints, proceed, in the matters of cleansing, 
filling, and preparing for the oven, precisely as directed in 
the case of roast turkey. As the roasting goes on, baste 
and turn as may be needful to secure a rich brown all over 
the fowls. Prepare the gravy as in the former case. 

Stewed CMcken. — Clean and cut the chicken into joints ; 
put it in a saucepan with the giblets; stew in just enough 
water to cover it until tender ; season with pepper, salt, and 
butter ; thicken with flour ; boil up once and serve with the 
gravy poured over it. 

Broiled Chicken. — Only young, tender chickens are nice 
broiled. After cleaning and washing them, split down the 
back, wipe dry, season with salt and pepper, and lay therh 
inside down on a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. 
Broil until nicely browned and well cooked through, watch- 
ing and turning to prevent burning. If chickens are large, 
steaming them for one-half hour before placing on the grid- 
iron will better insure their being cooked through. 



g-4 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR K 

Fricasseed CMckens. — Cut them in pieces, and put in the 
stewpan with salt and pepper ; add a little water, and let 
them boil half an hour ; then thicken the gravy with flour ; 
add butter and a little cream, if you have it. Catsup is an 
additional relish to the gravy. 

Smotliered CMcken. — Dress your chickens ; wash and let 
them stand in water half an hour to make them white ; cut 
them open at the back ; put into a baking-pan, sprinkle 
salt and pepper over them, putting a lump of butter here 
and there ; cover tightly with another pan the same size, and 
bake one hour ; baste often with butter. 

Fried Chicken. — Prepare the chicken as for stewing ; dry it, 
season with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and fry 
brown in hot butter or lard ; take it out, drain, and serve 
with Challenge Sauce, or some other savory condiment, or 
pour into the gravy left in the frying-pan a cup of milk, 
thicken with flour, add a little butter, and season with Sal- 
picant; boil once and pour over the chicken, or serve sepa- 
rately. 

CMckens Fried with Rice. — Take two or three chickens, 
cut them up, and half fry them ; then boil half a pint of rice 
in a quart of water, leaving the grains distinct, but not too 
dry ; stir one large tablespoonful of butter in the rice while 
hot ; let five eggs be well beaten into the rice, with a little 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg, if the last is liked ; put the chick- 
ens into a deep dish, and cover with the rice ; brown in an 
oven not too hot. 

Chicken Pie. — Line the sides of a deep pie-dish with a 
good puff paste. Have your chicken cooked, as for a 
fricassee, seasoned with salt and pepper and a litde chopped 
parsley. When they are nearly cooked, lay them in a pie- 
dish with half a pound of salt pork cut into small squares, 
and some of the paste also cut into half-inch pieces ; pour 



POULTRY AND GAME. ' Q^ 

in a part of the chicken gravy, thicken with a httle flour, 
and cover the dish with the paste cover. Cut a hole the 
size of a dollar in the cover, and cover it with a piece of 
dough. When baking, remove this piece occasionally and 
examine the interior. Brush egg over the top crust of the 
pie, and bake in a quick oven. Should the pie become dry 
pour in more of the gravy. Pigeon pie or any other bird 
pie may be made by the above recipe. 

Chicken Pot-pie. — Cut and joint a large chicken. Cover 
with water, and let it boil gently until tender. Season with 
salt and pepper, and thicken the gravy with two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour mixed smooth in a piece of butter the size of 
an egg. Have ready nice, light bread dough ; cut with a 
biscuit-cutter about an inch thick ; drop this into the boiling . 
gravy, having previously removed the chicken to a hot 
platter; cover, and let them boil from one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. To ascertain whether they are done, 
stick them with a fork ; if it comes out clean, they are done. 
Lay them on the platter with the chicken, pour over the 
gravy, and serve. 

. Pressed CMcken. — Boil three chickens until the meat comes 
off the bones ; then, removing all bones, etc., chop, not very 
fine ; add a piece of butter as large as an egg, salt and pepper 
to season well. Have about a pint of the broth, into whi(?h 
put' one-half box gelatine until dissolved ; then put back the 
chopped chicken and cook until the broth is evenly ab- 
sorbed. Press under a weight in a pan until cold. Veal 
may be treated in a similar manner with very excellent 
results. 

Jellied Chicken. — Boil a chicken in as little water as pos- 
sible, until the meat falls from the bones ; chop rather fine, 
and season with pepper and salt ; put in a mold a layer of 
5 . 



66 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the chopped meat, and then a layer of hard-boiled eggs cut 
in slices ; then layers of meat and Q.^<g alternately until the 
mold is nearly full ; boil down the liquor left in the pot 
one-half; while warm, add one-quarter of an ounce of gela- 
tine, and when dissolved pour into the mold over the meat. 
Sit in a cool place over night to jelly. 

Roast Goose and Duck. — A goose should always be par- 
boiled, as it removes the rank taste and makes it more 
palatable. Clean, prepare, and roast the same as turkey, 
only adding to the force-meat a large onion chopped fine. 
Ducks do not require parboiling (unless very old), otherwise 
they are cooked the same as geese. 

Canvas-back Duck. — Having picked, singed, and drawn it 
well, wipe it carefully, so as to have it clean without wash- 
ing. Truss it, leaving the head on, to show its quality. 
Place it in a moderately hot oven for at least three-quarters 
of an hour ; serve it hot, in its own gravy, on a large chafing- 
dish. Currant jelly should be on the table. 

Roast Pigeons. — Clean, wash, and stuff the same as poultry ; 
lay them in rows in a dripping-pan with a little water. 
Unless they are very fat, baste with butter until they are 
half done, afterward with their own gravy. 

* Roast Snipe. — Clean and truss, but do not stuff Lay in 
rows in the dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt, and baste well 
with butter, then with butter and water. When they begin 
to brown, cut as many slices of bread as there are birds. 
Toast quickly, butter, and lay in the dripping-pan, a bird 
upon each. When the birds are done, serve upon the toast, 
with the gravy poured over it. The toast should lie under 
them while cooking at least five minutes, during which time 
the birds should be basted with melted butter seasoned with 
pepper, The largest snipe will not require above twenty 



POULTRY AND GAME. ' 67 

minutes to roast. Or, dip an oyster in melted butter, then 
in bread-crumbs, seasoned with pepper and salt, and put in 
each bird before roasting. Small birds are especially de- 
licious cooked in this way. 

Roast Partridges, Pheasants, or Quails. — Pluck, singe, draw, 
and truss them ; season with salt and pepper ; roast for about 
half an hour in a brisk oven, basting often with butter. 
When done, place on a dish together with bread-crumbs 
fried brown and arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be 
served separately in a tureen. 

Quail on Toast. — Clean, wash, slit dowii the back, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and lay them on a gridiron, the inside 
down. Broil slowly ; when nicely browned, butter well. 
Serve with cream gravy on toast. Omitting the cream, 
gravy, and toast, you have the ordinary broiled quail. 
Pigeons, woodcock, and small birds may be broiled in the 
same manner, and are delicious and nourishing for invalids. 

Pried Rabbit. — After the rabbit has been thoroughly 
cleaned and washed, put it into boiling water and let it boil 
for about ten minutes ; drain, and when cold, cut it into 
joints; dip into beaten egg, and then into fine bread-crumbs, 
seasoned with salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry 
them in butter over a moderate fire fifteen minutes ; thicken 
the gravy with an ounce of butter and a small teaspoonful 
of flour. Serve hot. 

Roast Rabbit. — Dress nicely and fill with a dressing made 
of bread-crumbs, a little onion, sage, pepper, and salt, and a 
small piece of butter ; tie a piece of salt pork over it ; put 
into a dripping-pan with a little water in a quick oven ; 
baste often ; serve with currant jelly. 

Broiled Steaks of Venison. — Heat the gridiron, grease it 
well, lay on the steaks ; broil quickly, without scorching, 



68 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

turning them two or three times ; season with salt and 
pepper. Have butter melted in a well-heated platter, into 
which lay steaks, hot from the gridiron, turning them over 
several times in the butter, and serve hot with currant jelly 
on each . steak. It is well to set the platter into another 
containing boiling water. 

Game or Poultry in Jelly. — Take a knuckle of veal weighing 
two pounds ; a slice of lean ham ; one shallot, minced ; a 
sprig of thyme and one of parsley ; six pepper-corns (white) 
and one teaspoonful of salt, with three pints of cold water. 
Boil all these together until the liquor is reduced to a pint ; 
strain without squeezing, and set to cool until next day. It 
should then be a firm jelly. Take off every particle of fat. 
Then take one package gelatine, soaked in one cupful cold 
water for three hours ; one tablespoonful of sugar ; two table- 
spoonfuls strained lemon juice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
currant jelly, dissolved in cold water, and strained through 
a muslin cloth. Pour a quart oi boiling \y3X.qy over the gela- 
tine, stir for a moment, add the jellied " stock," and when 
this is dissolved, add sugar, lemon juice, and coloring. Stir 
until all are mixed and melted together, and strain without 
shaking or squeezing through a flannel bag until quite clear. 
Have ready several hard-boiled eggs, and the remains of 
roast game, roast or boiled poultry, cut in neat, thin slices, 
and salted slightly. Wet a mold with cold water, and 
when the jelly begins to harden, pour some in the bottom. 
Cut the whites of the eggs in pretty shapes — stars, flowers, 
rings, leaves — with a keen penknife, and arrange these on 
the lowest stratum of jelly, which should be thin, that the 
forms may be visible. Add more jelly, and on this lay 
slices of meat, close together. More jelly, and proceed in 
this order until the mold is full. Set in a cool place to 
harden, and then turn out upon a flat dish. A mold with 
smooth, upright sides, is best for this purpose.

RECIPES INCIDENTAL TO POULTRY, GAME, ETC. 

Gravy for Poultry. — Boil the giblets very tender ; chop fine ; 
then take the liquor in which they are boiled, thicken with 
flour ; season with salt, pepper, and a little butter ; add the 
giblets and dripping in which the turkey was roasted. 

Plain StuflSiig. — Take stale bread, cut off all the crust, rub 
very fine, and pour over it as much melted butter as will 
make it crumble in your hands ; salt and pepper to taste. 
See also under " Roast Turkey." 

Potato Stuffing. — Take two-thirds bread and one-third 
boiled potatoes grated, butter size of an ^%,^y pepper, salt, 
one ^^^ ; mix thoroughly. 

Oyster Stuffing. — By substituting oysters for potatoes in 
the above, you have oyster filling. See also under " Boiled 
Turkey." 

Stuffing for Boiled Chicken. — One cupful of bread-crumbs, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one ^^%y half a teaspoonful of 
salt, and one tablespoonful of sweet marjoram. Mix well; 
stuff and sew in. 

Capons. — Young male fowls, prepared by early gelding, 
and then nicely fattened, are the finest delicacies in the 
poultry line. They may be known by a small head, pale 
comb, which is short and withered, the neck feathers longer 
than usual, smooth legs, and soft, short spurs. They are 
cooked as ordinary chickens. 

Keeping Game. — Game is rendered more tender, and its 
flavor is improved by keeping. If wrapped in a cloth satu- 
rated with equal parts of pyroligneous acid and water, it 
will keep many days. If in danger of tainting, clean, rub 
well with salt, and plunge into boiling water, letting it run 
through them for five minutes ; then hang in a cold place. 
If tainted, put them in new milk over night. Always hang 
them up by the neck.

HOW TO SELECT BEEF; CHOICE ROASTING PIECES, STEAKS, BOIL- 
ING PIECES, SOUP PIECES, ETC. HOW TO ROAST, BROIL, AND 
BOIL BEEF. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING BEEF. 

GOOD beef may be known by its color. That of a 
deep, healthy red, fine, smooth, open grain, veined 
with white, being the best. The fat should be oily, 
smooth, and inclined to white, rather than yellow, as yellow 
fat is a sure sign of inferior quality. 

The sixth, seventh, and eighth ribs and the sirloin are 
considered the choicest cuts for roasting. The inside of the 
sirloin and the rump are the most tender for steaks, though 
here is a point where individual taste may be exercised. 
By some epicures what is known as the pin-bone steak is 
regarded as superior to any other. The round, buttock, 
shin, or brisket may be boiled or stewed. The neck or 
shoulder is generally used for soups, gravy, etc. 

In roasting beef it is necessary to have a brisk fire. The 
roast must be well seasoned with salt and pepper and 
dredged with flour. Baste it frequently. About fifteen 
minutes is required for roasting every pound of beef 

To broil meats well, have- the gridiron hot and the bars 
well greased before putting on the meat. 

In boiling beef, or indeed any fresh meat, plunge it into 
boiling water, that the outer parts may contract, and so 
retain the internal juices. Salt meats should be put on in 
cold water, that the salt may be extracted in the cooking. 
In boiling meats, it is important to keep the water constantly

boiling, otherwise the meat will absorb the water. Be 
careful to add boiling water only, if more is needed. Cold 
water will check the process of cooking and spoil the flavor. 
Remove the scum as soon as the boiling commences. Allow 
about twenty minutes boiling for each pound of fresh meat, 
and from one-half to three-quarters of an hour for all salt 
meats, except ham, which requires but fifteen minutes to the 
pound. The more gently all meats boil the more tender 
they will be. Slow boiling makes meat far better. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Beef. — The best roasting-pieces are the middle ribs 
and the sirloin. The ends of the ribs should be removed 
from the flank, and the latter folded under the beef and 
securely fastened with skewers. Rub a little salt into the 
fat part ; place the meat in the dripping-pan with a pint of 
stock or water ; baste freely, and dredge with flour half an 
hour before taking the joint from the oven. Should the 
oven be very hot, place a buttered paper over the meat to 
prevent it scorching while yet raw. When the paper is 
used it will need very little basting. Or, turn the rib side 
up toward the fire for the first twenty minutes. The time it 
will take in cooking depends upon the thickness of the joint 
and the length of time the animal has been killed. Skim the 
fat from the gravy and add a tablespoonful of prepared 
brown flour to the remainder. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding.— Take a large rib 
roast ; rub salt and pepper over it, and dredge with flour. 
Place on a rack in a dripping-pan, with very little water, 
until it is heated thoroughly; baste frequently. When 
nicely browned on the upper side, turn and baste. About 
three-quarters of an hour before it is done, take out the 
meat, pour off most of the dripping, put the batter for the 



72 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

pudding in the bottom of the pan, allowing the drippings 
from the beef to drop into it. When the pudding is done, 
return the meat and finish " roasting. Add some hot water 
to the dripping and thicken with flour for the gravy. 

For the batter of this pudding, take half a cup of butter, 
three cups of flour, three eggs, one cup of milk, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of fresh beef, extract the 
bone, and take away the fat. For a round weighing ten 
pounds, make a seasoning or stuffing as follows : Half a 
pound of beef suet ; half a pound of grated bread-crumbs ; 
the crumbled yelks of three hard-boiled eggs ; a little 
bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves chopped; another of 
sweet basil ; four onions minced small; a large tablespoonful 
of mixed mace and nutmeg powdered- Season lightly with 
salt and cayenne. Stuff this mixture into the place from 
whence you took out the bone. Make a number of deep 
cuts about the meat, and stuff them also. Skewer the meat 
into a favorable shape, and secure its form by tying it round 
with tape. Put it into a tin bakepan, and pour over it a 
pint of port wine. Put on the lid, and bake the beef slowly for 
five or six hours, or till it is thoroughly done. If the meat 
is to be eaten hot, skim all the fat from the gravy, into 
which, after it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten yelks 
of two eggs. Minced oysters may be substituted for onions. 

Spiced Beef. — Boil a shin of beef weighing ten or twelve 
pounds, until the meat falls readily from the bones. Pick 
the meat to pieces, and mash the gristle very fine, rejecting 
all parts that are too hard to mash. Set away the liquor in 
which the beef has boiled till it is. cold ; then takeoff all the 
fat. Boil the liquor down to a pint and a half Roll a 
dozen crackers very fine, and add them to the meat. Then 
return the meat to the liquor, and heat it all. Add salt and 
pepper to taste, half a teaspoonful of cloves, half a teaspoon- 



o 



ME A TS. ^'. 

ful of cinnamon, half a teaspoonful of parsley chopped fine, 
and a little powdered nutmeg. Let it boil up once, and put 
into a mold or deep dish, with a weight adjusted to press 
it down. When it is entirely cold, cut into thin slices. 

Savory Beef. — Take a shin of beef from the hind-quarter, 
saw it into four pieces, put it into a pot, and boil it until the 
meat and gristle drop from the bones ; chop the meat very 
fine, put it in a dish, and season it with a little salt, pepper, 
clove, and sage, to your taste ; pour in the liquor in which 
the meat was boiled, and place it away to harden. Cut in 
slices and eat cold. 

Minced Beef. — Cut cold roast beef into thin slices; put 
some of the gravy into a stewpan, a bit of butter rolled in 
flour, pepper and salt, and boil it up. Add a little catsup, 
and put in the minced slices, and heat them through, but do 
not let it boil. Put small slices of toast in the dish, and 
cover with the meat. 

Deviled Beef. — Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them on 
hot coals, and broil ; season with pepper and salt, and serve 
while hot, with a small lump of butter on each piece. 

Curried Beef. — Take about two ounces of butter and place 
them' in a saucepan with two small onions cut up into slices, 
and let them fry till they are of a light brown ; then add a 
tablespoonful and a half of curry powder, and mix it up 
well. Now cut up the beef into pieces about an inch 
square ; pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of milk, 
and let it simmer for thirty minutes ; then take it off and 
place it in a dish with a little lemon juice. While cooking 
stir constantly, to prevent burning. Send it to table with a 
wall of mashed potatoes or rice around it. 

Beef Hash. — Chop fine cold steak or roast beef, and cook 
in a little water; add cream or milk, and thicken with flour; 
season to taste, and pour over thin slices of toast.

Beef Stew. — Cut cold beef into small pieces, and put into 
cold water ; add one tomato, a little onion, chopped fine ; 
pepper and salt, and cook slowly ; thicken with butter and 
flour, and pour over toast. 

Boiled Corned Beef. — Put four or five pounds of lean corned 
meat into a pot with plenty of water. The water should be 
hot. The same care should be taken in skimming as for 
fresh meat. Allow half an hour for every pound of meat 
after it has begun to boil. The excellence of corned beef 
depends very much upon its being boiled gently and long. 
If it is to be eaten cold, lay it, when boiled, into a coarse 
earthen dish or pan, and over it a clean board about the 
size of the meat ; upon this put a heavy weight. Salt meat 
is much improved by pressing. 

Stewed SMn of Beef — Wash, and set it on to stew in suffi- 
cient cold water to keep it just covered until done. When 
it boils, take off the scum, and put an ounce and a quarter 
of salt to the gallon of water. It is usual to add a few cloves 
and some black pepper, slightly bruised and tied up loosely 
in a fold of muslin, two or more onions, a root of celery, a 
bunch of savory herbs, four or five carrots, and as many 
turnips, either whole or sliced ; if to be served with the 
meat, the last two will require a little more than the ordinary 
time of boiling, but otherwise they may be simmered with 
the meat from the beginning. Give the beef from four to 
five hours' gentle stewing, and serve it with part of its own 
liquor thickened and flavored, or quite plain. 

Boiled Tongue. — Soak the tongue over night, then boil four 
or five hours. Peel off the outer skin and return it to the 
water in which it was boiled to cool. This will render it 
juicy and tender. 

Baked Heart. — Wash carefully and stuff nicely ; roast or 
bake and serve with gravy, which should be thickened with 



MEATS. 75 

some of the stuffing. It is very nice hashed, with a little 
port wine added. 

Broiled Beefsteak. — Have the choice steaks cut three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; grease the gridiron and have it 
well heated. Put the steak over a hot, clear fire. When the 
steak is colored, turn it over, which must be done without 
sticking a fork into it and thus letting out the juice. It 
should be quite rare or pink in the centre, but not raw. 
When cooked sufficiently, lay on a hot platter and season 
with pepper and salt ; spread over the top some small bits of 
butter, and serve immediately. Salt extracts the juices of 
meats in cooking. Steaks ought not to be salted until they 
have been broiled. 

Beefsteak with Onions. — Take a nice rumpsteak, and pound 
it with a rolling-pin until it is quite tender; flour and season; 
put it into a frying-pan with hot lard and fry it. When 
well browned on both sides,takeitup and dredge with flour. 
Have about two dozen onions ready boiled ; strain them in 
a colander and put them in a frying-pan, seasoning with 
pepper and salt ; dredge in a little flour, and add a small 
lump of butter ; place the pan over the fire and stir the 
onions frequently, to prevent their scorching. When they 
are soft and a little brown, return the steak to the pan, and 
heat all together. Place the steak on a large dish, pour the 
onions and gravy over it, and send to the table hot. 

Beefsteak and Tomatoes. — Stew a dozen good-sized tomatoes 
one hour, with salt and pepper. Then put in a pound of 
tender beefsteak, cut in small pieces, and boil fifteen min- 
utes longer. Lay buttered toast in a deep dish, pour on the 
steak and tomato, and you have a most relishing and 
healthful dish. 

Stuffed Beefsteak. — Take a rump steak about an inch thick. 
Make a stuffing of bread and herbs, and spread it over the 
steak. Roll it up, and with a needle and coarse thread sew 



76 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

it together. Lay it in an iron pot on one or two wooden 
skewers, and put in water just sufficient to cover it. Let it 
stew slowly for two hours — longer if the beef is tough ; 
serve it in a dish with the gravy turned over it. To be 
carved crosswise, in slices, through beef and stuffing. 

Beefsteak Pudding. — Prepare a good suet crust, and line a 
cake tin with it; put in layers of steak, with onions, toma- 
toes and mushrooms chopped, a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and cayenne, and half a teacupful of water before closing it. 
Bake from an hour and a half to two hours, and serve hot. 



II.— VEAL. 



CHOOSING VEAL, FOR ROASTING, FOR STEWING; THE HEAD, 
FEET, KIDNEYS, SWEET-BREADS, ETC. ; GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR -COOKING VEAL. 

VEAL should be fat, finely grained, white, firm, and not 
overgrown. When large, it is apt to be coarse and tough, 
and \i too young, it lacks flavor and is less wholesome. 
It is more difficult to keep than any meat except pork, and 
should never be allowed to acquire the slightest taint before 
it is dressed. 

The fillet, the loin, the shoulder, and the best end of the 
neck, are the parts preferred for roasting ; the breast and 
knuckle are more usually stewed or boiled. The head and 
feet of the calf are valuable articles of food, both for the 
nutriment which the gelatinous parts of them afford, and for 
the greater variety of modes in which they may be dressed. 
The kidneys, with the rich fat that surrounds them, and the 
sweet-breads especially, are well-known delicacies ; the 
liver and the heart also are very good eating; and no meat 
is so generally useful for rich soups and gravies as veal. 



MEATS. 77 

The best veal is from calves not less than four, or more 
than six weeks old. If younger it is not wholesome. If 
older its character begins to change materially from the 
calf's use of grasses and other food. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Veal. — Take a loin or fillet of veal ; make a stuffing 
as for roast turkey ; fill the flat with the stuffing, and sew it 
firmly to the loin ; rub the veal with salt, pepper, and flour, 
and put it into a pan with a little water. While roasting, 
baste frequently, letting it cook until thoroughly done. 
Allow two hours for a roast weighing from six to eight 
pounds. When done, remove the threads before sending 
to the table ; thicken the gravy with a little flour. Veal 
should be rather overdone. 

Pot-roasted Fillet. — Remove the bone and fill the cavity 
with a force-meat made of bread-crumbs, a very little salt, 
pork chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt, and ground cloves. 
Lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork ; put in the fil 
let, fastened with skewers, cover with additional pork, pour 
over it a pint of good stock, cover down close, and let it 
cook slowly two or three hours ; then take off the cover 
and let it brown. Serve hot. 

Boiled Fillet. — A small and delicately white fillet should 
be selected for this purpose. Bind it round with tape, after 
having washed it thoroughly ; cover it well with cold water, 
and bring it gently to a boil ; clear off carefully the scum 
as it rises, and be very cautious not to allov/ the water to 
become smoked. Let the meat be gently simmered for three 
hours and a half to four and a half, according to its weight. 
Send it to table with rich white sauce. 

Veal Stew. — Cut four or five pounds of veal into strips ; 
peel a dozen large potatoes, and cut them into slices ; place 
a layer of sliced salt pork with salt, pepper, sage, and onion 



78 ^^^^ ^^O USE WIFE'S LIBRA R Y. 

on the bottom of the pot, then a layer of potatoes, then a 
layer of the veal nicely seasoned. Use up the veal thus. 
Over the last layer of veal put a layer of the pork, and 
over the whole a layer of potatoes. Pour in water till it 
covers the whole ; cover the pot closely ; heat it rapidly for 
a few minutes, and then let it simmer two hours. 

Veal HasL — Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce- 
pan, stir into it an even teaspoonful of flour wet in a table- 
spoonful of cold water, and let it boil five minutes ; add 
one-half teaspoonful of black pepper, as much salt, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and let it keep hot, but not boil. 
Chop the veal fine and mix with half as much stale bread- 
crumbs. Put into a pan and pour the gravy over it, then 
let it simmer ten minutes. Serve this on buttered toast. 

Veal Pie. — Line a pudding-dish with good pie crust ; into 
this put a layer of veal cut into small slices from the neck, 
or other less valuable part ; make a second layer of hard- 
boiled eggs sliced thin ; butter and pepper this layer. Add 
a layer of sliced ham, or salt pork, squeezing a few drops 
of lemon juice on the ham. Add more veal, as before, with 
eggs, ham, etc., till the dish is nearly full. Pour over a 
cupful of stock and cover with a stout crust. Bake in a 
moderate oven for two hours. 

Veal Pot Pie. — Make a crust of a dozen mashed potatoes, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a teacup of milk or cream, 
a little salt, and flour enough to stiffen it nicely. Fry half 
a dozen slices of salt pork, then cut up the veal and boil 
these together, in but little water, till the veal is almost 
done. Peel and slice a dozen potatoes quite thin, and roll 
the dough about half an inch thick and cut it into strips. 
Now build in your pot a layer of crust, meat, potatoes ; then 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Then another set of layers, 
and top off with crust. Pour on the liquor in which the 
meat was cooked, and let all simmer for half an hour, or until 



MEATS. 79 

the top crust is cooked. Brown the crust by holding over 
it a red-hot shovel. 

Veal Loaf. — Take a piece of butter the size of an ^g^, three 
pounds of raw veal, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, one of 
pepper, and two raw eggs. Chop the veal fine and mix all 
together, and put in about two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mold this into a loaf, then roll it in eight tablespoonfuls of 
rolled crackers, and pour over it three tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter ; place in a pan and bake two hours. To be 
sliced off when cold, and served at luncheon or tea. 

Veal with Oysters. — Cut the veal in small, thin slices, place 
it in layers in a jar with salt, pepper, and oysters. Pour in 
the liquor of the oysters, set the jar in a kettle of boiling 
water, and let it stew till the meat becomes very tender. 

Veal with. Rice. — Pour over a small knuckle of veal rather 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; bring it slowly to a 
boil ; take off all the scum with great care ; throw in a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and when the joint has simmered for about 
half an hour, throw in from eight to twelve ounces of well- 
washed rice, and stew the veal gently for an hour and a half 
longer, or until both the meat and rice are perfectly tender. 
A seasoning of cayenne and mace in fine powder, with more 
salt, should it be required, must be added twenty or thirty 
minutes before they are served. For a superior stew, good 
veal broth may be substituted for the water. 

Veal with Peas. — A quart or more of full-grown green 
peas, instead of rice, added to the veal, prepared as above, 
as soon as the scum has been cleared off, will make a most 
excellent stew. It should be well seasoned with white 
pepper, and the mace should be omitted. 

Cutlets in Cracker. — Pound the cudet and season, cut the 
edges into good shape ; take one ^^^^ beat it a little, roll 
the cutlet in it, then cover thoroughly with rolled crackers.

cold water somewhat salted. Allow them to lie in this ten 
minutes, wipe them very dry, and with a sharp knife split in 
half, lengthwise. Broil over a clear, hot fire, turning when- 
ever they begin to drip. Have ready upon a deep plate 
melted butter, well salted and peppered, mixed with catsup

ing them every minute. Unless very large, they should be 
done in about twelve minutes. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and lay on a hot dish, with butter upon each. 

Calf's Tongue. — Of all the tongue preparations, calf's 
tongue is regarded as best. To pickle them, use for each 
a quarter pound of salt, one ounce of saltpetre, and a quar- 
ter pound of sugar. Rub the tongues daily with this, allow- 
ing them to lie in pickle for two weeks, after which they 
will be ready for smoking or boiling. If used without 
smoking, they require no soaking, but should simmer sev- 
eral hours till perfectly done, when the skin will peel off 
readily. If soaking is needed, lay them first in cold water 
and then in tepid water for two hours each; then boil till 
done.

III.— MUTTON AND LAMB. 

CHOOSING MUTTON AND LAMB, FOR ROASTING, FOR BOILING; 
CUTLETS, SUITABLE VEGETABLES, ETC. THIRTEEN RECIPES FOR 
MUTTON AND LAMB. 

THE best mutton is small-boned, plump, finely grained, 
and short legged ; the lean of a dark, rather than of a 
bright hue, and the fat white and clear ; when this is 
yellow, the meat is rank, and of bad quality. The leg and 
the loin are the desirable joints ; and the preference would 
probably be given to the latter, but for the superabundance 
of its fat, which renders it a somewhat wasteful part. 

The parts for roasting are the shoulder, saddle, or chine, 
the loin, and haunch. The leg is best boiled, unless the 
mutton is young and very tender. The neck is sometimes 
roasted, but it is more generally boiled ; the scrag, or that 
part of it which joins the head, is seldom used for any other 
purpose than making broth, and should be taken off before 
the joint is dressed. Cutlets from the thick end of the loin 
are commonly preferred, but they are frequently taken from 
the best end of the neck and from the middle of the leg. 

Lamb should be eaten very fresh. In the fore-quarter, the 
vein in the neck should be blue, otherwise it is stale. In the 
hind-quarter the fat of the kidney will have a slight odor if 
not quite fresh. Lamb soon loses its firmness if stale. 

New potatoes, asparagus, green peas, and spinach, are the 
vegetables to be eaten with roast lamb. 

RECIPES. 

Roast Mutton. — Wash the meat well, sprinkle with pepper 
and salt, dredge with flour, and put in the dripping-pan, 
with a little water in the bottom. Baste often with the drip- 
pings, skim the gravy well, and thicken with flour. 



MEATS. 33 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Cut off the shank-bone, trim the 
knuckle, and wash the mutton ; put it into a pot with salt, 
and cover with boiling water. Allow it to boil a few min- 
utes ; skim the surface clean, draw your pot to the side of the 
fire, and simmer until done. Time, from two to two hours 
and a half. Do not try the leg with a fork to determine 
whether it is done. You lose the juices of the meat by so 
doing. Serve with caper sauce, or drawn butter, well sea- 
soned. The liquor from this boiling may be converted into 
soup with the addition of a ham-bone and a few vegetables 
boiled together. 

Mutton Dressed like Venison. — Skin and bone a loin of 
mutton, and lay it into a stewpan with a pint of water, a 
large onion stuck with a dozen cloves, half a pint of port 
wine, and a spoonful of vinegar; add, when it boils, a little 
thyme and parsley, and some pepper and salt ; let it stew 
three hours, and turn it often. Make some gravy of the 
bones, and add it at intervals to the mutton. 

BroUed Mutton Chops. — Trim off a portion of the fat, or the 
whole of it, unless it be liked ; heat the gridiron, rub it with 
a bit of the mutton suet, broil over a brisk fire, and turn 
often until they are done, which, for the generality of eaters, 
will be in about eight minutes, if the chops are not more 
than half an inch thick, which they should not be. Add 
salt and pepper with melted butter, and serve on a hot 
plate. 

Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a breast of mutton not too 
fat, cut it into small, square pieces, dredge it with flour, and fry 
to a fine brown in butter ; add pepper and salt, cover it with 
water, and set it over a slow fire to stew, until the meat is 
perfectly tender. Take out the meat, skim off all the fat from 
the gravy, and just before serving add a quart of young 
peas, previously boiled with the strained gravy, and let the 
whole boil gently until the peas are entirely done. 



84 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Irish Stew. — Blanch three pounds of mutton chops by dip- 
ping them first in boiling water, for two or three minutes, 
and then into ice-cold water. Place them on the bottom of 
a clean stewpan, barely covering them with cold water. 
Bring them slowly to a boil ; add one teaspoonful of salt ; 
skim clean ; add a little parsley, mace, and a few pepper- 
corns. Simmer twenty minutes ; add a dozen small onions 
whole, and two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed well with cold 
water. Let it simmer for an hour ; add a dozen potatoes 
pared and cut to about the size of the onions. Boil till 
these are done ; then dish, placing the chops around the 
edge of the plate, and pouring the onions and potatoes into 
the centre. Strain the gravy, add three tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, and pour over the stew. 

Boiled Leg of Lamb. — Choose a ewe leg, as there is more 
fat on it ; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap, and the thick 
skin on the back of it ; soak in warm water for three hours, 
then boil gently (time according to size). Serve with oyster 
sauce. (See Sauces.) 

Roast Lamb. — Wash well, season with pepper ana salt, put 
in the dripping-pan with a little water. Baste often with 
the dripping ; skim the gravy well and thicken with flour. 

Lamb Stewed in Butter. — Select a nice loin, wash well, and 
wipe very dry ; skewer down the flap, and lay it in a close-shut- 
ting and thick stewpan, or saucepan, in which three ounces 
of good butter have been just dissolved, but not allowed to 
boil ; let it simmer slowly over a very gentle fire for two 
hours and a quarter, and turn it when it is rather more than 
half done. Lift it out, skim, and pour the gravy over it ; 
send to table with brown gravy, mint sauce, and a salad. 

Saddle of Lamb. — This is a dainty joint for a small party. 
Sprinkle a little salt over it, and set it in the dripping-pan, 
with a few small pieces of butter on the meat; baste it 



MEATS. 85 

occasionally with tried-out lamb-fat; dredge a little flour 
over it a few minutes before taking from the oven. Serve 
with currant-jelly and a few choice early vegetables. Mint- 
sauce may be served with the joint, but in a very mild form. 
(See Sauces.) 

Broiled Lamb Chops. — Trim off most of the fat ; broil over 
a brisk fire, turning frequently until the chops are nicely 
browned. Season with pepper and salt, and baste with hot; 
butter. Serve on a buttered dish. 

Breaded Lamb Chops. — Grate plenty of stale bread, season 
with 3alt and pepper, have ready some well-beaten ^^^^ have 
a spider with hot lard ready, take the chops one by one, dip 
into the egg, then into the bread-crumbs; repeat it, as this 
will be found an improvement ; then lay the chops sep- 
arately into the boiling lard, fry brown, and then turn. To 
be eaten with currant jelly. 

Lamb Steaks, Fried. — Dip each steak into well-beaten ^g^, 
cover with bread-crumbs or corn-meal, and fry in butter or 
new lard. Mashed potatoes and boiled rice are a necessary 
accompaniment. The gravy may be thickened with flour 
and butter, adding a little lemon juice ; pour this hot upon 
the steaks, and place the rice in spoonfuls around the dish 
to garnish it. 



IV.— PORK. 



PORK REQUIRES CAREFUL CHOOSING; NEEDS THOROUGH COOK- 
ING. NINETEEN RECIPES FOR COOKING PORK. 

PORK, more than any other meat, requires to be chosen 
with the greatest care. The pig, from its gluttonous 
habits, is particularly liable to disease, and if killed 
and eaten when in an unhealthy condition, those who par- 
take of it will probably pay dearly for their indulgence. 
Dairy-fed pork is the best. 



^g THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE Y. 

If this meat be not thoroughly well-done, it is disgusting 
to the sight and poisonous to the stomach. '' In the gravy 
of pork, if there is the least tint of redness," says an emi- 
nent medical authority, " it is enough to appall the sharpest 
appetite. Other meats under-done may be unpleasant, but 
pork is absolutely uneatable." 

RECIPES. 

Roast Pig. — A fat pig about three weeks old is best for a 
roast. Wash it thoroughly inside and out ; chop the liver 
fine with bread-crumbs, onions, parsley, pepper, salt, and 
potatoes boiled and mashed ; make it into a paste with but- 
ter and Qgg. Put this stuffing into the pig and sew it up ; 
put in a baking-pan with a little water and roast over a 
bright fire, basting well with butter; rub frequently also 
with a piece of lard tied in a clean rag. When thoroughly 
done, lay the pig, back up, in a dish, and put a red apple or 
pickled-mango in its mouth. Make a dressing with some 
of the stuffing, with a glass of wine and some of the drip- 
ping. Serve with the roast pig, and also in a gravy-boat. 

Roast Pork. — Choose for roasting, the loin, the leg, the 
saddle, the fillet, the shoulder, or the spare-rib. The loin 
of young pork is roasted with the skin on, and this should 
be scored in regular strips of about a quarter inch wide 
before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of the leg 
also should be cut through in the same manner. This will 
prevent blistering, and render it more easy to carve. In 
beginning the roasting the meat should be placed at some 
distance from the fire, in order that it may be heated through 
before the skin hardens. The basting should be constant. 
The cooking must be thorough and the meat well-browned 
before removed from the fire. 

Roast Spare-rib. — Spare-rib should be well rubbed with 
salt and pepper before it is roasted. If large and thick, it 



MEATS. 87 

will require two or three hours to roast; a very thin piece 
may be roasted in an hour. Lay the thick end to the fire. 
When you put it down to roast, dust on some flour, and 
baste with a little butter. The shoulder, loin, and chine are 
roasted in the same manner. 

Leg of Pork Roasted. — Parboil a leg of pork, take ofl" the 
skin, and then roast ; baste with butter, and make a savory 
powder of finely minced or dried or powdered sage, ground 
black pepper, salt, and some bread-crumbs rubbed together 
through a colander ; add to this a little very finely minced 
onion ; sprinkle the meat with this when it is almost done ; 
put a half pint of gravy into the dish. 

Baked Pork Tenderloins. — Split the tenderloin lengthwise 
nearly through ; stuff with a filling of bread-crumbs, pep- 
per, salt, and sweet marjoram. Tie a string around it, to 
keep the filling in, and bake in a hot oven for half an hour, 
basting well as the cooking proceeds. 

Pork Cutlets. — Cut them about half an inch thick from a 
delicate loin of pork, trim into neat form, and take off part 
of the fat, or the whole of it when it is not liked ; dredge a 
little pepper or cayenne upon them, and broil (or fry) over 
a clear and moderate fire from fifteen to eighteen minutes, 
sprinkle a little fine salt upon them just before they are 
dished. They may be dipped into Qgg and then into bread- 
crumbs mixed with minced sage, then finished in the usual 
way. When fried, flour them well, and season with salt and 
pepper. Serve with gravy made in the pan. 

Boiled Ham. — The soaking which must be given to a ham 
before it is boiled depends both on the manner in which it 
has been cured and on its age. If highly salted, hard, and 
old, a day and night, or even longer, may be requisite to' 
open the . pores sufficiently and to extract a portion of the 
salt. The water must be several times changed during the 
steeping. After the ham has been scraped or brushed as 



88 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

clean as possible, pare away lightly any part which may be 
blackened or rusty. Lay it into a suitable kettle and cover 
it plentifully with cold water ; bring it very slowly to boil, 
and clear off the scum, which will be thrown up in great 
abundance So soon as the water has been cleared from 
this, draw the pot to the edge of the stove, that the ham 
may be simmered slowly but steadily, until it is tender. On 
no account allow it to boil fast. When it can be probed 
very easily with a sharp skewer, lift it out, strip off the skin, 
and return the ham to the water to cool. 

Baked Ham. — A ham of sixteen pounds must be boiled 
three hours, then skin and rub in half a pound of brown 
sugar, cover with bread-crumbs, and bake well for two 
hours. 

Glazed Ham. — Take a cold-boiled ham from which the skin 
has been removed, and brush it well all over with beaten 
^SS- 'To ^ ^^P ^^ powdered cracker allow enough rich 
milk or cream to make into a thick paste, salt it, and work 
in a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this evenly, a 
quarter of an inch thick, over the ham, and set to brown in 
a moderate oven. 

Ham and Eggs. — Cut the ham in very thin sh'ces, and fry 
long enough to cook the fat, but not long enough to crisp 
the lean. A very little boiling water may be put into the 
frying-pan to secure the ham moist and tender. Remove 
the ham Avhen it is done, break eggs gently into the pan, 
without breaking the yelks, and fry till done, about three 
minutes. The eggs will not require to be turned. Cut off 
the uneaven edges, place the eggs around the ham, and pour 
in the gravy. 

Ham or Tongue Toast. — Toast a thick slice of bread and 
butter it on both sides. Take a small quantity of remains 
of ham or tongue, grate it, and put it in a stewpan with two 



MEATS. 89 

hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and mixed with a Httle but- 
ter, salt, and cayenne ; heat it quite hot, then spread thickly 
upon the buttered toast. Serve while hot. 

Broiled Salt Pork. — Cut the pork in thin slices. Put a lit- 
tle water in the pan, and when it has boiled three minutes 
pour it off; dredge the pork with flour and brown it. 

Bacon Broiled or Fried. — Cut evenly into thin slices, or rash- 
ers ; pare from them all rind and rust; curl them round; 
fasten them with small, slight skewers, then gently fry, broil, 
or toast them ; draw out the skewers before they are sent to 
table. A few minutes will dress them either way. They 
may be cooked without being curled. The slow cooking is 
necessary that the meat may be well done without being 
dried or hardened. 

Fried Sausage. — Sausages should be used while quite fresh. 
Melt a piece of butter or dripping in a clean frying-pan ; 
when just melted, put in the sausages, shake the pan for a 
minute, and keep turning them ; do not break or prick 
them ; fry them over a very slow fire till they are nicely 
browned ; when done, lay them on a hair-sieve before the 
fire to drain the fat from them. The secret of cooking sau- 
sages well is to let them heat very gradually. If so done 
the skins will not burst if they are fresh. The common 
practice of pricking them lets the gravy out, which is un- 
desirable. 

Baked Sausages. — The most wholesome way to cook sau- 
sages is to bake them. Place them in a baking-pan in a 
single layer, and bake in a moderate oven ; turn them over 
when half done, that they may be equally browned. Serve 
with pieces of toast between them, having cut the toast 
about the same size as the sausage, and moistened it with a 
little of the sausage fat. 

Sausage Meat. — Many prefer to use sausage meat in bulk. 



90 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

Small portions of the meat should be packed lightly to- 
gether and fried slowly until nicely browned. When done, 
drain through a hair-sieve. Do not pack hard. It will 
make the sausages tough. 

Scrappel. — Boil a hog's head one day, and let it stand five 
or six hours, or all night. Slip out the bones and chop 
fine ; then return the meat to the liquor ; skim when cold ; 
warm and season freely with pepper, salt, sage, and sweet 
herbs. Add two cupfuls of buckwheat-meal and one cup- 
ful of corn-meal. Put into molds, and when cold cut into 
slices and fry for breakfast. 

Boiled Pork. — The shoulder or leg are regarded as the 
most economical pieces for boiling. They should be well 
salted first, by about ten days' pickling. Boil precisely as 
ham is boiled, but not for so long a time, about three hours 
sufficing to thoroughly cook an ordinary sized leg of pork. 
After it has come to the boiling point, let the process pro- 
ceed slowly as possible. Peel off the skin when done and 
spot the surface with dashes of red and black pepper, or 
with allspice, or garnish with parsley. 

Souse. — Pigs' feet and ears may be soused by cleaning 
thoroughly, soaking in salt and water several days, and then 
boiling till the bones can be picked out with ease and the 
skin peeled off. Cover the meat and gelatinous substance 
with boiling vinegar, highly spiced with peppercorns and 
mace. This may be eaten cold or the meat may be fried 
after dipping in ^^^ and cracker. 

Pig's head may be prepared the same way, the meat being 
chopped fine and mixed with pounded crackers. Mix with 
herbs, spices, salt, and pepper to taste, and a small quantity 
of vinegar. Press into a mold, or a jar, and cut in slices. 
To be eaten cold.

VEGETABLES SHOULD BE FRESH — HOW TO WASH AND PRESERVE — 

BOW TO COOK WELL, AND IMPORTANCE OF SO DOING SUITABLE 

POTS FOR COOKING VEGETABLES — VEGETABLES SUITABLE TO 
CERTAIN MEATS. FIFTY-FIVE RECIPES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

ALL vegetables should be used when fresh as possible. 
Wash them thoroughly, and allow them to lie in cold 
water until ready to be used. 

Great care must be taken to remove gravel and insects 
from heads of lettuce, cabbage, and cauliflower. To do 
this, lay them for half an hour or more in a pan of strong 
brine, placing the stalk ends uppermost. This will destroy 
the small snails and other insects which cluster in the 
leaves, and they will fall out and sink to the bottom. 

Strong-flavored vegetables, like turnips, cabbage, and 
greens, require to be put into a large quantity of water. 
More delicate vegetables, such as peas, asparagus, etc., 
require less water. As a rule, in boiling vegetables, let the 
water boil before putting them in, and let it continue to 
boil until they are done. Nothing is more indigestible than 
vegetables not thoroughly cooked. Just when they are 
done must be ascertained to a certainty in each particular 
case, without depending upon any general directions. 

Never let boiled vegetables stand in the water after com- 
ing off the fire ; put them instantly into a colander over a 
pot of boiling water, and let them remain there, if you have 
to keep them back from the table. 

An iron pot will spoil the color of the finest greens ; they 
should be boiled by themselves in a tin, brass, or copper 
vessel.

Potatoes are good with all meats. Carrots, parsnips, tur- 
nips, greens, and cabbage belong with boiled meats ; beets, 
peas, and beans are appropriate to either boiled or roast. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled White Potatoes. — Peel off a strip about a quarter of 
an inch wide, lengthwise, around each potato. Put them 
on in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it. Let them 
boil fifteen minutes, then pour off half the water and replace 
it with cold water. When the edge of the peel begins to 
curl up they are done. Remove them from the pot, cover 
the bottom of a baking-tin with them, place them in the 
oven, with a towel over them, for fifteen minutes, leaving 
the oven door open. Then serve with or without the skins. 

The use of cold water in boiling potatoes, as in this recipe, 
is exceptional. Hot water is generally used, but for this 
purpose cold seems preferable. 

Roasted White Potatoes. — Select the largest and finest 
potatoes for roasting. Wash them thoroughly and put in 
the oven with their skins on. Roast about one hour, turn- 
ing them occasionally. with a fork. When done, send them 
to the table hot, and in their skins. 

Potatoes Roasted with Meats. — To roast potatoes with beef, 
poultry, and other meats, peel the potatoes, lay them in a 
pan, and cook them in the gravy. It is quite proper to 
roast both white and sweet of potatoes in the same pan. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Steam or boil pared potatoes until soft, 
in salted water ; pour off the water and let them drain per- 
fectly dry ; sprinkle with salt and mash ; have ready hot 
milk or cream, in which has been melted a piece of butter ; 
pour this on the potatoes, and stir until white and very light. 
A solid, heavy masher is not desirable. An open wire tool 
is much better. 



VEGETABLES. 93 

Stewed Potatoes. — Take sound raw potatoes, and divide 
each into four parts, or more, if they be very large. Put 
them into the stewpan; add salt, pepper, and a piece of 
fresh butter; pour in milk, with a little cream, just to keep 
the potatoes from burning. Cover the saucepan, and allow 
the potatoes to stew until thoroughly soft and tender. 

Pried Potatoes. — Boil some good and large potatoes until 
nearly done ; set them aside a few minutes ; when suffi- 
ciently cool, slice or chop them ; sprinkle them with pepper 
and salt, and fry in butter or fresh lard until they are of a 
light brown color. Serve hot. 

Saratoga Potatoes. — Peel and slice the potatoes on a slaw- 
cutter, into cold water ; wash them thoroughly, and drain ; 
spread between the folds of a clean cloth, rub and pat until 
dry. Fry a few at a time in boiling lard ; salt as you take 
them out. Saratoga potatoes are very nice when eaten cold. 
They can be prepared three or four hours before needed, 
and if kept in a warm place they will be crisp and nice. 
They may be used for garnishing game and steaks. 

Potato Cakes. — Mash thoroughly a lot of potatoes just 
boiled ; add a little salt, butter and cream ; fry brown on 
both sides, after making into little cakes. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. — Take large, fine potatoes, wash 
clean ; boil with the skins on in plenty of water, but without 
salt. They will take at least one hour. Drain off the water, 
and set them for a few minutes in a tin pan before the fire, 
or in the oven, that they may be well dried. Peel them be- 
fore sending to the table. 

Roasted Sweet Potatoes. — Sweet potatoes are roasted in the 
same manner as white, but they require a little longer time. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes. — Choose large potatoes, half boil 
them, and then, having taken off the skins, cut the potatoes 
in slices and fry in butter, or in nice drippings. 



94 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Stewed Tomataes. — Pour boiling water on the tomatoes to 
be used, and then peel and slice them. Stew them gently, 
without adding any water, fifteen minutes ; then add some 
pulverized cracker or bread crumbs, sufficient to thicken it 
a little, and salt and pepper to your taste. Stew fifteen min- 
utes longer, and add a large piece of butter. 

The thickening suggested is not essential. Many prefer 
the pure tomatoes. Try both ways and adopt the more 
pleasing. 

Broiled Tomatoes. — Cut large tomatoes in two, from side to 
side, not from top to bottom ; place them on a gridiron, the 
cut surface down ; when well seared, turn them and put on 
butter, salt, and pepper ; then cook with the skin side down 
until done. 

Fried Tomatoes. — Cut the tomatoes in slices without skin- 
ning ; pepper and salt them well ; then sprinkle a little flour 
over them and fry in butter until browned. Put them on a 
hot platter ; then pour milk or cream into the butter and 
juice, and when this is boiling hot, pour it over the tomatoes. 

Tomatoes Baked Whole. — Select a number of sound, ripe 
tomatoes. Cut a round hole in the stem side of each, and 
stuff it with bread-crumbs, nicely peppered and salted ; cover 
the bottom of the pan with the tomatoes, the opened side 
upward ; put in a very little water, dredge with flour, and 
bake till brown. Serve hot. 

Baked Sliced Tomatoes. — Skin the tomatoes, slice in small 
pieces ; spread a thick layer in the bottom of a pudding 
dish ; cover with a thin layer of bread-crumbs, and sprinkle 
salt, pepper, and a few small pieces of butter over them ; 
add another layer of tomatoes, then of crumbs, etc., until 
the dish is filled ; sprinlde over the top a layer of fine rolled 
crackers ; bake one hour. Canned tomatoes, put up whole, 
may be used nicely this way. 



VEGETABLES. 95 

Tomato^ a la Creme. — Pare and slice ripe tomatoes; one 
pound of fresh ones or a quart can; stew until perfectly 
smooth, season with salt and pepper, and add a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg. Just before taking from the fire, stir 
in one cup of cream, with a tablespoonful of flour stirred 
smooth in a part of it ; do not let it boil after the flour is put 
in. Have ready in a dish some pieces of toast ; pour the 
tomatoes over this and serve. 

Boiled Green Com. — Take off the outside leaves and the 
silk, letting the innermost leaves remain on until after the 
corn is boiled, which renders the corn much sweeter. Boil 
for half an hour in plenty of water, drain, and after fully re- 
moving, the leaves, serve. 

Baked Corn. — Grate one dozen ears of sweet corn, one cup 
of milk, a small piece of butter ; salt to taste, and bake in a 
pudding dish for one hour. 

Corn Fritters, see Fritters. 

Lima Beans. — Shell, wash, and put into boiling water; 
when boiled tender, drain and season them. Dress with 
cream, or with a large lump of butter, and let the whole 
simmer for a few moments before serving. 

Succotash. — Take ten ears of green corn and one pint of 
Lima beans; cut the corn from the cob, and stew gently 
with the beans until tender. Use as little water as possible. 
Season with butter, salt, and pepper — milk, if you choose. 
If a few of the cobs are stewed in the succotash, it Avill 
improve the flavor, as there is great sweetness in the cob. 

String Beans. — Remove the strings of the beans with a 
knife, and cut off both ends. Cut each bean into three 
pieces, boil tender, add butter when they are done, pepper 
and salt, and serve hot. 

Boiled Beans. — Dried beans must soak over night in soft 
water ; put them in a strong bag, leaving room for them to 



96 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

swell ; let them boil in a plenty of water until doij.e ; hang 
up the bag that all the water may drain off; then season 
with butter, pepper, and salt to the taste. 

Baked Beans.— Put the beans to soak early in the evening, 
in a dish that will allow plenty of water to be used. Change 
the water at bed-time. Next morning early, parboil two 
hours ; pour off nearly all the water ; take raw pork, scored 
on top ; put the beans in a deep dish, a stoneware jar is very 
nice, the pork in the middle, sinking it so as to have it just 
level with the surface. Add half a teaspoonful of soda, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, and bake at least six hours. As 
the beans bake dry, add more water, a little at a time, until 
the last hour, when it is not necessary to moisten them. 

Boiled Green Peas. — The peas should be young and freshly 
shelled ; wash and drain them carefully ; put them into fast- 
boiling, salted water ; when quite tender drain, and add pep- 
per, butter, and a little milk. Serve hot. 

Boiled Asparagus. — Scrape the stems of the asparagus 
lightly, but make them very clean, throwing them into cold 
water as you proceed. When all are scraped, tie them in 
bunches of equal size ; cut the hard ends evenly, that all 
may be of the same length, and put into boiling water. 
Prepare several slices of delicately browned toast half an 
inch thick. When the stalks are tender, lift them out and 
season with pepper and salt. Dip the toast quickly into the 
liquor in which the asparagus was boiled, and dish the veg- 
etable upon it, the points, or the butts, meeting in the cen- 
tre of the dish. Pour rich melted butter over it, and send 
to the table hot. 

Boiled Beets. — Wash, but do not cut them, as cutting de- 
stroys the sweetness ; let them boil from two to three hours, 
or until they are perfectly tender ; then take them up, peel 
and slice them, and pour vinegar, or melted butter, over 
them, as may be preferred. 



VEGETABLES, 97 

Boiled Turnips. — Pare and cut into pieces ; put them into 
boilino; water well salted, and boil until tender ; drain thor- 
oughly and then mash and add a piece of butter, pepper, 
and salt to taste. Stir until they are thoroughly mixed, and 
serve hot. 

Boiled Onions. — Skin them carefully and put them to boil ; 
when they have boiled a few minutes, pour off the water, 
add clean cold water, and then set them to boil again. 
Pour this away also, and add more cold water, when they 
may boil till done. This change of waters will make them 
white and -clear, and very mild in flavor. After they are 
done, pour off all the water, and dress with a little cream, 
salt, and pepper to taste. 

Fried Onions. — Peel and slice fresh, solid onions very 
evenly, then fry them in a pan of hot butter till slightly 
browned. 

Boiled Leeks. — Trim off the coarser leaves of young leeks, 
cut them into equal lengths, tie them in small bunches, and 
boil in plenty of water, previously salted. Serve on toast, 
and send melted butter to the table with them. 

Boiled Squash. — Remove the seeds ; boil till very tender ; 
then press out all the water through a colander, and mash, 
with butter, pepper, and salt. 

Pried Squash. — Pare the squash, cut in slices, dip in ^gg 
seasoned with pepper and salt, then into cracker dust, and 
^y to a nice brown. 

BoUed Parsnips. — Scrape thoroughly, then wash and boil 
in a little water well salted. When done, dress with butter 
and a little pepper, or drawn butter, if desired. 

Fried Parsnips. — Having boiled your parsnips, split open 
the largest ones, season with pepper and salt, dredge a little 
flour over them, and fry to a light brown. ^ .

Fried Egg-plant. — Pare and cut in slices quarter of an inch 
thick ; sprinkle with salt ; cover and let stand for an hour. 
Pour off the juice or water which exudes; wipe each slice 
dry ; dip first in beaten Qg^, then in rolled cracker or bread 
crumbs. Season with pepper and salt, and fry brown in but- 
ter. Serve very hot. 

Fried Egg-plant No. 2. — Put into water and boil until soft, 
then cut in two and scoop out all the inside ; season ; take 
a tablespoonful of the remaining pulp at a time, dip in egg 
and bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. Serve hot. 

Baked Egg-plant. — Boil them till somewhat tender, in order 
to remove the bitter flavor. Then slit each one down the 
side, and take out the seeds. Have ready a stuffing made 
of grated cracker, butter, minced herbs, salt, pepper, nut- 
meg, and beaten yelk of eggs. Fill with this the cavity left 
by the seeds, and bake the plants in a hot oven. Serve with 
well-seasoned gravy poured around them in the dish. 

Boiled Cabbage. — Strip off the loose or withered leaves, and 
wash well ; then split in two, or if the head be very large, 
into four pieces, and put into boiling water with some salt ; 
let it boil slowly, skimming carefully and frequently. When 
done, strain through a colander. Serve in a vegetable-dish 
and lay inside, among the leaves, some bits of butter ; sea- 
son with pepper, and serve while hot. 

Boiled Cauliflower. — Trim off all the outside leaves ; wrap 
in a cloth and put into boiling water well salted ; boil until 
tender, and then serve with drawn butter. 

Cabbage a la Cauliflower. — Cut the cabbage fine, as for 
slaw ; put it into a stewpan, cover with water, and keep 
closely covered ; when tender, drain off the water ; put in a 
small piece of butter, with a little salt, one-half a cupful of 
cream, or one cupful of milk. Leave on the stove a few 
minutes before serving. 



. VEGETABLES, 99 

Boiled Spinacli. — Boil the spinach in plenty of water, drain, 
and press the moisture from it ; chop it small, put it into a 
clean saucepan, with a slice of fresh butter, and stir the 
whole until well mixed and very hot. Smooth it in a dish, 
and send it quickly to table. 

Boiled Greens. — Turnip-tops, mustard-tops, cabbage-leaves, 
beet-tops, cowslips, dandelions, and various similar articles 
are much relished in the spring, boiled in salt and water or 
with salt pork. When done sufficiently they will sink to 
the bottom. 

Stewed Celery. — Clean the heads thoroughly; take off the 
coarse, green, outer leaves ; cut the stalks into small pieces, 
and stew in a little broth ; when tender, add some rich 
cream, a little flour, and butter enough to thicken the 
cream. Season with pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg, if 
that is agreeable. 

Boiled Artichokes. — Soak the artichokes and wash them in 
several waters ; cut the stalks even; trim away the lower 
leaves, and the ends of the other leaves ; boil in salted 
water with the tops downward, and let them remain until 
the leaves can be easily drawn out. Before serving, remove 
the surrounding leaves, and send the remainder to the table 
with melted butter. 

Broiled Mushrooms. — In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle 
salt on the gills ; if they turn yellow, they are poisonous ; if 
they turn black, they are good. When satisfied at this 
point, pare, and cut off the stems, dip them in melted butter, 
season with salt and pepper, broil them on both sides over 
a clear fir.e, and serve on toast. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — Being sure you have the genuine 
mushrooms, put them in a small saucepan, season with 
pepper and salt, add a spoonful of butter and a spoonful or 
two of gravy from roast meat, or, if this be not at hand, the

same quantity of good, rich cream ; shake them about over 
the fire, and when they boil they are done. 

Boiled Rice. — Wash a cupful of rice in two or three 
waters ; let it lie for a few minutes in the last water, then 
put it into three quarts of fast-boiling water, with a little 
salt; let it boil twenty minutes, then turn into a colander, 
drain, and serve, using such sauce or dressing as may be 
desired. 

BoUed Hominy. — Soak one cupful of fine hominy over 
night in three cupfuls of water, and salt to taste ; in the 
morning turn it into a quart pail ; then put the pail into a 
kettle of boiling water, cover tightly, and steam one hour ; 
add one teacupful of sweet milk, and boil fifteen minutes 
additional, then serve hot. 

Stewed Macaroni. — Break the macaroni into small pieces, 
wash it, and put into salted hot water ; cook about twenty 
minutes ; drain, and put in a vegetable dish a layer of 
macaroni, sprinkle with grated cheese, bits of butter, pepper 
and salt ; proceed in this manner until the dish is full, but 
omit the cheese at the last. Set the dish in the oven for a 
few minutes, and let it get thoroughly /loL 

Baked Macaroni. — For baked macaroni, proceed as in 
stewed, but, when prepared fully as above, pour a few 
spoonfuls of milk over the top, and bake half an hour. 

Macaroni with Tomatoes. — Have water boiling in a large 
saucepan; throw into it macaroni, broken, but not too short; 
let it cook twenty to thirty minutes, pour over it some cold 
water, and strain it quite dry ; cut an onion into small dice, 
throw it into cold water and squeeze it dry in a cloth ; put 
some olive oil, butter, or clarified fat into a saucepan ; the 
oil, of course, is best. Throw into it the onion, and let it 
cook, shaking occasionally, until the onion is almost melted 
away. Have some cooked tomatoes ready to add to this

sauce. If it is too thick, add some cold water by teaspoon- 
fuls at a time. Let all simmer for ten minutes longer. 
Sprinkle some grated cheese over your macaroni, which 
must be piping hot, in a dish. Pour the sauce over this and 
serve. A quarter of a pound of macaroni makes a large 
dish, and takes about a third of a can to half a can of 
tomatoes. 

' Sliced Cucumbers. — Peel and slice the cucumbers as thin as 
possible ; lay the slices in salted water for an hour ; then 
pour off the water ; cover them with vinegar, half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and salt as may be necessary. 

Stewed Oyster-plant. — Cut off the tops of a bunch of 
salsify, or oyster-plant, close to the root ; scrape and wash 
well, and slice lengthwise or round ; stew until tender in 
salted water ; drain and put in a stewpan, cover with milk ; 
to one pint of salsify add a tablespoonful of butter rolled in 
flour ; season with salt and pepper ; let it stew a few min- 
utes and add a little vinegar, if liked. 

Mock Fried Oysters. — Scrape one bunch of salsify, and boil 
until tender ; mash through a colander, add one beaten ^^'gy 
a small piece of butter, salt and pepper to taste; drop by the 
spoonful into hot lard and fry brown.

SAUCES DEFINED IHEIR USES AND COMPOSITION. HOW TO 

PREPARE INGREDIENTS FOR SALADS, WHAT VEGETABLES TO 
EMPLOY, FRESHNESS, EXCELLENCE, ETC. FORTY-SIX RECIPES 
FOR SALADS AND SAUCES. 

U^NDER the head of salads all preparations of uncooked 
herbs or vegetables is placed. They are usually 
dressed with salt, vinegar, oil, and spices. Sometimes 
they are combined with meat or shell fish, as chicken, veal, 
lobster, etc. They are used chiefly as relishes with other 
food. 

Sauces are generally used to impart a relish to articles 
of food. Sometimes vegetables are employed as the basis 
of sauces, but they are compounded chiefly of savory con- 
diments, that they may add zest to eating. 

Meat or fish used in salads should not be minced, but 
rather picked apart, or cut in pieces of moderate size. Cab- 
bage, celery, asparagus, cauliflower, water-cress, and all 
kinds of lettuce are the vegetables best adapted for use in 
salads. They must be used when quite fresh and crisp, and 
all the ingredients used in their dressing must be of the 
best quality and flavor. 

All condiments are in some sense sauces, but the term is 
usually confined to those which are the result of compound- 
ing a variety of articles. 

RECIPES. 

Coldslaw. — With a sharp knife, or, better, with a knife 
made for the purpose, cut up into fine shavings a firm head 
of cabbage ; sprinkle with as much salt and pepper as you

SALADS AND SAUCES. 103 

deem necessary ; beat up the yelk of one egg, add a lump 
of butter the size of a walnut, a gill of cream, the same 
quantity of vinegar, a tablespoonful of sugar, an even tea- 
spoonful of mustard, and a pinch of bruised celery seed. 
Heat these condiments together, without boiling, and pour 
over the sliced cabbage ; then toss it with a fork until thor- 
oughly mixed. Allow time for it to cool before serving. 

Coldslaw, No. 2. — Take equal parts of chopped cabbage 
and the green stalks of celery. Season with salt, pepper, 
and vinegar. 

Maryland Coldslaw. — Halve the cabbage and lay it in cold 
water for one hour ; shave down the head into small slips 
with a sharp knife. Put in a saucepan a cup of vinegar, and 
let it boM ; then add a cup of cream, with the yelks of two 
eggs, well beaten ; let it boil up, and pour over the cabbage. 
As soon as the cabbage is cut it should be sprinkled with a 
little salt and pepper. 

Cabbage Salad. — Take one head of fine, white cabbage, 
minced fine ; three hard-boiled eggs ; two tablespoonfuls 
of salad oil ; two teaspoonfuls white sugar ; one teaspoonful 
salt ; one teaspoonful pepper; one teaspoonful made mustard; 
one teacupful vinegar. Mix and pour upon the chopped 
cabbage. 

Lettuce Salad. ^Take a good-sized head of lettuce and pull 
the leaves apart. Wash them a moment, then shake off the 
water and dry the leaves. Examine them carefully, wipe 
off all grit, and reject those that are bruised. Take the yelks' 
of two hard-boiled eggs ; add one-half teaspoonful of mixed 
mustard, and mix to a paste with a silver fork ; then add 
slowly, mixing carefully, about one-half a cup of vinegar, 
one teaspoonful of sugar, and salt to taste ; cut the lettuce 
small as may be desired with a sharp knife, and pour the 
dressing oyer it ; garnish with hard-boiled eggs.

Potato Salad. — Steam and slice the potatoes ; add a very 
little raw onion chopped very fine, and a Httle parsley, and 
pour over the whole a nice salad dressing. Serve either 
warm or cold, as may be preferred. 

Potato Salad, No. 2. — Cut up three quarts of boiled potatoes, 
zvMe hot, into neat pieces ; add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, a tablespoonful of chopped onion, a teaspoonful of 
pepper, and one of salt ; also add a cupful of oil, and mix ; 
then add a cupful of warm stock, a wineglassful of vinegar 
(from the mixed-pickle bottle) ; mix the ingredients together 
carefully, and do not break the potatoes any more than is 
absolutely unavoidable. Set the whole in the ice-box and 
serve cold. The onion and parsley may be omitted, and 
boiled root celery added, or a little stalk celery chopped fine. 

CMcken Salad. — Boil a small chicken until very tender. 
When entirely cold, remove the skin and fat, cut the meat 
into small bits, then cut the white part of the stalks of celery 
into pieces of similar size, until you have twice as much 
celery as meat. Mix the chicken and celery together; pour 
on Durkee's Salad Dressing, and stir all thoroughly. Cold 
veal used in place of chicken will also make a very excel- 
lent salad. 

Chicken Salad, No. 2. — Take three chickens, boil until very 
tender; when cold, chop them, but not too fine ; add twice 
the quantity of celery cut fine, and three hard-boiled eggs 
sliced. Make a dressing with two cups of vinegar, half a 
cup of butter (or two tablespoonfuls of oil), two eggs 
beaten, with a large tablespoonful of mustard, saltspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, tablespoonful of pepper, 
or a little cayenne pepper ; put the vinegar into a tin pan 
and set in a ketde of boiling water ; beat the other ingre- 
dients together thoroughly and stir slowly into the vinegar 
until it thickens. Cool it and pour over the salad just be- 
fore serving.

VIII.— CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 



CROQUETTES DEFINED ; FRITTERS DEFINED ; USES OF BOTH. 
TWENTY-FOUR RECIPES FOR CROQUETTES AND FRITTERS. 

THE term croquette (pronounced cro-ket) is from a French 
verb, meaning " to crunch." It designates all that class 
of preparations made of minced meat, or other in- 
gredients, highly seasoned and fried in bread-crumbs. 

Fritters, like croquettes, are fried, but they are made of 
batter containing other ingredients, as taste may dictate. 
Both these preparations are used as accessories of the din- 
ner or tea table rather than as principal dishes. 

RECIPES. 

Rice Croquettes. — Put a quarter of a pound of rice into a 
pmt of milk. Let it simmer gently until the rice is tender 
and the milk absorbed.' It must then be boiled until thick 
and dry, or it will be difficult to mold. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one of butter, one egg, aod flavor to taste 
with vanilla or cinnamon ; beat thoroughly for a few minutes, 
and when cold form into balls or cones, dip these into 
beaten ^^^y roll lightly in bread-crumbs, and fry in hot butter. 

Hominy Croquettes. — To a cupful of cold boiled hominy 
(small grained) add a tablespoonful of melted butter and stir 
hard; moisten by degrees with a cupful of milk, beating to a 
soft, light paste. Put in a teaspoonful of white sugar and a 
well-beaten ^^^. Roll into oval balls with floured hands, 
dip in beaten ^^g^ then in cracker-crumbs, and fry in hot 
lard.

Potato Croquettes. — Season cold mashed potatoes with pep- 
per, salt, and nutmeg. Beat to a cream, with a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter to every cupful of potato. Add two or 
three beaten eggs and some minced parsley. Roll into small 
balls ; dip in beaten ^g%, then in bread-crumbs, and fry in 
hot lard. 

Oyster-Plant Croquettes. — Wash, scrape, and boil the oyster- 
plant till tender ; rub it through a colander, and mix with 
the pulp a little butter, cream, salt, cayenne, and lemon juice; 
mix the ingredients thoroughly together to a smooth paste, 
and set the dish in the ice-box to get cold ; then shape it 
into small cones, dip them in beaten ^^g, roll in crumbs, 
and fry crisp and brown. 

CMcken Croquettes. — Add to the quantity of minced chicken; 
about one-quarter the quantity of bread-crumbs, also one 
^gg well beaten to each cupful of meat ; pepper, salt, and 
chopped parsley to taste, add the yelks of two hard-boiled 
eggs rubbed smooth. Add gravy or drawn butter to moisten 
it, make into cones or balls, roll in cracker-dust or flour, 
and fry in hot lard. 

Veal Croquettes. — Make these the same as chicken cro- 
quettes, by substituting for the chicken cold minced veal and 
ham in equal parts. The salt may be omitted, as the 
ham usually supplies it sufficiently. Turkey, duck, or the 
remains of any cold game or meat may be used in the same 
way with very satisfactory results. 

Oyster Croquettes. — Take the hard ends of the oysters, leav- 
ing the other end for a soup or stew ; scald them, then chop 
fine, and add an equal weight of potatoes rubbed through a 
colander ; to one pound of this combination add two ounces 
of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pep- 
per, half a teaspoonful of mace, and one-half gill of cream, 
make in small rolls, dip them in t^g and grated bread, fry 
in deep, hot lard.

ing been well beaten. Drop this batter by large spoon- 
fuls into boiling lard and fry to a light brown. Serve hot, 
powdered with white sugar. 

Bread Fritters. — Grate stale bread until you have a pint of 
crumbs ; pour a pint of boiling milk upon these, a table- 
spoonful of butter having been dissolved in it, and let the 
whole stand for an hour. Then beat up the mixture and 
flavor with nutmeg. Stir in gradually a quarter pound of 
white sugar, two tablespoonfuls of brandy, six well-beaten

IX.— EGGS. 



NUTRITIOUS VALUE OF EGGS TEST OF FRESHNESS PACKING EGGS 

— PRESERVING EGGS. TWENTY-SEVEN WAYS OF COOKING EGGS. 



HIGH chemical authorities agree that there is more nutri- 
ment in an egg than in any substance of equal bulk 
found in nature or produced by art. They are much 
used for food the world over, and few articles are capable 
of more varied employment. 

The freshness of an egg may be determined in various 
ways. In a fresh egg, the butt end, if touched on the 
tongue, is sensibly warmer than the point end. If held to- 
ward the light and looked through (" candled "), a fresh egg 
vi^ill show a clear white and a well-rounded yelk. A stale 
egg will appear muddled. Probably the surest test is to put 
the eggs into a pan of cold water. Fresh eggs sink quickly ; 
bad eggs float; suspicious ones act suspiciously, neither 
sinking nor floating very decidedly. Of all articles of food, 
doubtful eggs are most certainly to be condemned. 

On the packing of eggs, the following conclusions may 
be regarded as established among egg-dealers : By cold 
storage, temperature forty to forty-two degrees Fahrenheit, 
kept uniform, with eggs packed properly or in cases, they 
will keep in good condition from six to nine months ; but 
they must be used soon after being taken out of the cold 
storage, as they soon spoil. Eggs become musty from being 
packed in bad material. They will become musty in cases, 
as a change of temperature causes the eggs to sweat and 
the wrapping-paper to become moist and taint the eggs.

j^ ]^ g THE HO USE WIFR S LIBRAE V. 

Well-dried oats, a year old, makes the best packing. Eggs 
become " mixed" by jarring in shipping. Fresh eggs mix 
worse than those kept in cold storage. Eggs which have 
been held in cold storage in the West should be shipped in 
refrigerator cars in summer. Eggs will keep thirty days 
longer if stood on the little end than in any other position. 
They must be kept at an even temperature and in a pure 
atmosphere. Eggs laid on the side attach to the shell and 
are badly injured. To prevent imposition as to the freshness 
of the eggs, the egg gatherers should " candle " them when 
they get them from the farmers. Eggs keep better in the 
dark than in the light. 

Methods of preservation for domestic purposes are, to 
pack them in bran or salt, the small end down ; to grease 
them with linseed oil, or dip them in a light varnish. For 
extra long keeping, slack one pound of lime in a gallon of 
water ; when this is entirely cold, place it in a jar and fill 
with fresh eggs. Do not agitate the contents when eggs 
are removed from the jar. Eggs kept so will continue good 
for a year. 

The French method of preserving eggs is to dissolve 
beeswax and olive oil and anoint the eggs all over. If left 
undisturbed in a cool place, they will remain good for two 
years. 

RECIPES. 

Boiled Eggs. — Put into a saucepan of boiling water with a 
tablespoon, being careful not to break or crack them. Boil 
steadily three minutes, if you want them soft ; ten, if hard. 

Another way is to put them on in cold water, and let it 
come to a boil. The inside, white and yelk, will be then of 
the consistency of custard. 

Still another way is to put them in water, heated to the 
boiling point, and let them stand from five to seven minutes 
without boiling. If desired for salad, boil them ten minutes ; 



EGGS. 119 

then throw them in cold water ; roll them gently on a table 
or board, and the shell can be easily removed. Wire ^^^ 
racks, to set in boiling hot water with the eggs held in place, 
are exceedingly convenient. 

Boiled Eggs, with Sauce. — Boil hard, remove the shell, set 
in a hot dish, and serve with seasoning and sauce to taste. 

Poached Eggs. — Have the water well salted, but do not let 
it boil hard. Break the eggs separately into a saucer, and 
slip them singly into the water-; when nicely done, remove 
with a skimmer, trim neajtly, and lay each ^<g^ upon a small 
thin square of buttered toast, then sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Some persons prefer them poached rather than 
fried with ham ; in which case substitute the ham for toast. 

Poached Eggs with Ham Sauce. — Mince fine two or three 
slices of boiled ham, a small onion, a little parsley, pepper, 
and salt ; stew together for a quarter of an hour ; put the 
poached eggs in a dish, squeeze over them the juice of a 
lemon, and pour on the sauce hot but not boiling. 

Poached Eggs a la Creme. — Nearly fill a clean frying-pan 
with water boiling hot ; strain a tablespoonful of vinegar 
through double muslin, and add to the water with a little 
salt. Slip your eggs from the saucer upon the top of the 
water (first taking the pan from the fire). Boil three min- 
utes and a half; drain, and lay on buttered toast in a hot 
dish. Turn the water from the pan and pour in half a cup- 
ful of cream or milk. If you use the latter, thicken with a 
very little corn-starch. Let it heat to a boil, stirring to pre- 
vent burning, and add a great spoonful of butter, some pep- 
per, and salt. Boil up once and pour over the eggs. Or 
better still, heat the milk in a separate saucepan, that the 
eggs may not have to stand. A little broth improves the 
sauce. 



120 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Steamed Eggs. — Butter a tin plate and break in your eggs ; 
set in a steamer ; place over a kettle of boiling water, and 
steam until the whites are cooked; they are more orna- 
mental when broken into patty tins, as they keep their form 
better ; the whites of the eggs, when cooked in this manner, 
are tender and light, and not tough and leathery, as if cooked 
by any other process. 

Eggs in this style can be eaten by invalids, and are very 
much richer than by any other method. 

Wliirled Eggs. — Put a quart of water, slightly salted, into 
a Saucepan over the fire, and keep it at a fast boil. Stir 
with wooden spoon or ladle in one direction until it whirls 
rapidly. Break six eggs, one at a time, into a cup and drop 
each carefully into'the centre, or vortex, of the boiling water. 
If kept at a rapid motion, the ^^<g will become a soft, round 
ball. Take it out carefully with a perforated spoon, and put 
it on a slice of buttered toast laid upon a hot dish. Put a 
bit of butter on the top. Set the dish in the oven to keep 
warm, and proceed in the same way with another ^^%, hav- 
ing but one in the saucepan at a time. When all are done, 
dust lightly with salt and pepper and send up Jiot. 

Eggs a la Mode. — Remove the skin from a dozen tomatoes, 
medium size, cut them up in a saucepan, add a little butter, 
pepper, and salt ; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or 
six eggs, and just before you serve, turn them into a sauce- 
pan with the tomato, and stir one way for two minutes, allow- 
ing them time to be well done. 

Baked Eggs. — Mix finely chopped ham and bread-crumbs 
in about equal proportions, season with salt and pepper, and 
moisten with milk and a little melted butter; half fill your 
small patty pans with the mixture, break an ^^'g over the 
top of each, sprinkle with fine bread-crumbs, and bake; 
serve hot. 



EGGS. 121 

Baked Eggs, No. 2. — Butter a clean, smooth saucepan, break 
as many eggs as will be needed into a saucer, one by one, 
and if found good, slip each into the saucepan. No broken 
yelk must be allowed, nor must they crowd so as to risk 
breaking the yelk after put in. Put a small piece of butter 
on each, and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well- 
heated oven, and bake till the whites are set. If the oven 
is rightly heated, it will take but a few minutes, and the 
cooking will be far more delicate than fried eggs. 

Eggs sur le Plat. — Melt butter on a stone-china or tin plate. 
Break the eggs carefully into this ; dust lightly with pepper 
and salt, and put on top of the stove until the whites are 
well set. Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

Scrambled Eggs. — Put into a frying-pan enough butter to 
grease it well ; slip in the eggs carefully without breaking 
the yelks ; add butter, and season to taste ; when the whites 
begin to set, stir the eggs from the bottom of the pan, and 
continue stirring until the cooking is completed. The 
appearance at the end should be marbled, rather than mixed. 

Scrambled Eggs with Ham. — Put into a pan, butter, a little 
pepper and salt, and a little milk ; when hot, drop in the 
eggs, and with a knife cut the eggs and scrape them from 
the bottom as the whites begin to set ; add some cold ham 
chopped fine, and when done, serve in a hot dish. 

Toasted Eggs. — Cover the bottom of an earthenware or 
stone-china dish with rounds of delicately toasted bread, or 
with rounds of stale bread dipped in beaten ^g^ and fried 
quickly to a golden-brown in butter or nice dripping. 
Break an ^^^ carefully upon each, and set the dish imme- 
diately in front of a glowing fire. Toast over this as many 
slices oi fat salt pork or ham as there are eggs in the dish, 
holding the meat so that it will fry veiy quickly and all the 
dripping fajl upon the eggs. When these are well set, they 
are done. Turn the dish several times while toasting the

meat, that the eggs may be equally cooked. Do not send 
the pork to table, but pepper the eggs lightly and remove 
with the toast to the dish in which they go to the table. 

Egg Toast. — Beat four eggs, yelks and whites, together 
thoroughly ; put two tablespoonfuls of butter into a sauce- 
pan and melt slowly ; then pour in the eggs and heat, with- 
out boiling, over a slow fire, stirring constantly ; add a little 
salt, and when hot spread on slices of nicely browned toast 
and serve at once. 

Egg Baskets. — Boil quite hard as many eggs as will be 
needed. Put into cold water till cold, then cut neatly into 
halves with a thin, sharp knife ; remove the yelk and rub to 
a paste with some melted butter, adding pepper and salt. 
Cover up this paste and set aside till the filling is ready. 
Take cold roast duck, chicken, or turkey, which may be on 
hand, chop fine and pound smooth, and while pounding 
mix in the paste prepared from the yelks. As you pound, 
moisten with melted butter and some gra\y which may 
have been left over from the fowls ; set this paste when done 
over hot water till well heated. Cut off a small slice from 
the end of the empty halves of the whites, so they will stand 
firm, then fill them with this paste ; place them close to- 
gether on a flat, round dish, and pour over the rest of the 
gravy, if any remains, or make a little fresh. A few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk improves this dressing. 

Fricasseed Eggs. — Boil six eggs hard ; when cold, slice 
with a sharp knife. Have ready some slices of stale bread, 
fried to a nice brown in butter or drippings. Put a cupful 
of good broth in drawn butter over the fire, season it with 
pepper, salt, and a trace of onion ; let it come to a boil. 
Dip the slices of ^^^ first into raw ^^^, then into cracker 
dust or bread-crumbs, and lay them gently into the gravy 
upon the side of the range. Do not let it actually boil, lest 
the eggs should break, but let them lie thus in the gravy at 



EGGS. 123 

least five minutes. Place the fried bread upon a platter, lay 
the sliced eggs evenly upon this, pour the gravy over all, 
and serve hot. 

Curried Eggs. — Boil six or eight fresh eggs quite hard, 
and put them aside until they are cold. Mix well together 
from two to three ounces of good butter, and from three to 
four dessertspoonfuls of currie-powder ; shake them in a 
stewpan, or thick saucepan, over a clear but moderate fire 
for some minutes, then throw in a couple of mild onions 
finely minced, and fry gently until they are soft; pour in by 
degrees from half to three-quarters of a pint of broth or 
gravy, and stew slowly until they are reduced to pulp ; mix 
smoothly a small cup of thick cream with two teaspoonfuls 
of wheaten or rice flour ; stir them to the currie, and simmer 
the whole until the raw taste of the thickening is gone. 
Cut the eggs into half-inch slices, heat them through in the 
sauce without boiling them, and send to the table as hot as 
possible. 

Plain Omelet. — Beat thoroughly yelks of five eggs, and a 
dessertspoonful of flour, rubbed smooth in two-thirds of a 
cupful of milk. Salt and pepper to taste, and add a piece 
of butter the size of a hickory-nut. Beat the whites to a 
stiff froth, pour the mixture into the whites, and without 
stirring pour into a hot, buttered omelet pan. Cook on top 
of the range for five minutes ; then set pan and all into the 
oven to brown the top nicely. 

Baked Omelet— Beat the yelks of six eggs, and add the 
whites of three eggs beaten very light ; salt and pepper to 
taste, and a tablespoonful of flour mixed in a cup of milk. 
Pour into a well-buttered pan and put into a hot oven ; 
when thick, pour over it the whites of three eggs beaten 
light; then brown nicely, without allowing the top to be- 
come crusted. Serve immediately.

THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



Omelet a la Mode. — Beat the yelks and whites of six eggs 
separately until light, then beat together and add one table- 
spoonful of cream. Have in the omelet pan a piece of 
butter; when the butter is boiling hot, pour in the omelet 
and shake until it begins to stiffen, and then let it brown, and 
season to taste. Fold double and serve hot. 

If a larger omelet is desired, a tablespoonful of milk to 
each ^-g^ may be added, and one teaspoonful of corn-starch 
or flour to the whole. 

Cheese Omelet. — ^Butter the sides of a deep dish and cover 
with thin slices of rich cheese ; lay over the cheese thin 
slices of well-buttered bread, first covering the cheese with 
a little red pepper and mustard; then another layer of cheese ; 
beat the yelk of an ^gg in a cup of cream or milk, and pour 
over the dish, and put at once into the oven ; bake till nicely 
browned. Serve hot, or it will be tough and hard, but when 
properly cooked it will be tender and savory. 

Meat or Fisli Omelet. — Make the same as plain omelet. When 
it is done, scatter thickly over the surface cold, boiled ham, 
tongue, poultry, fish, or lobster, chopped fine, and season 
nicely to taste ; slip the broad knife under one side of the 
omelet and double, inclosing the meat. Then upset the 
frying-pan upon a hot dish, so transferring the omelet with- 
out breaking. Or the minced meat may be stirred in after 
the ingredients are put together, and before cooking. Be 
careful not to scorch the ^%g. 

Omelet with Oysters. — Allow one ^%g for each person, 
and beat yelks and whites separately, very light ; season 
to taste, and just before cooking add the oysters, which have 
been previously scalded in their own liquor. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Hard boil some fresh eggs, and, when 
cold, cut them into moderately thin slices, and lay them be- 
tween slices of bread and butter cut thin, and season well 



EGGS. 125 

with celery salt. For picnic parties or for traveling, these 
sandwiches are very nice. 

Deviled Eggs. — Boil the eggs hard, remove the shell, and 
cut in two as preferred. Remove the yelks, and add to them 
salt, cayenne pepper, melted butter, and mixed mustard to 
taste ; then stuff the cavities of the hard whites, and put the 
halves together again. Serve garnished with parsley. For 
picnics, etc., each Qgg can be wrapped in tissue paper to 
preserve its form. 

Pickled Eggs. — Boil the eggs until very hard ; when cold, 
shell them, and cut them in halves lengthways. Lay them 
carefully in large-mouthed jars, and pour over them scalding 
vinegar, well seasoned with whole pepper, allspice, a few 
pieces of ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. When cold, tie 
up closely, and let them stand a month. They are then fit 
for use. With cold meat, they are a most delicious and 
delicate pickle. 

Egg Balls. — Rub the yelks of hard-boiled eggs with the 
raw yelk of an egg, well beaten, and season to taste. Roll 
this paste into balls the size of marbles, adding flour if neces- 
sary to thicken, and boil two minutes. A valuable embel- 
lishment and enrichment of soups. 



X.— BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 

AN immense department is opened up by the title of this 
chapter; and it is a department of immense im- 
portance. Bread is confessedly the " staff of life," 
and, therefore, it should be good. And whatever takes the 
place of bread, be it biscuits, hot cakes, muffins, or what 
not, should also be good, or nothing is gained by the 
exchange. Many a housekeeper can make excellent pies, 
cakes, etc., but when bread is needed, she flies to the bakery, 
confessing her total inability to prepare this indispensable 
commodity. 

But even bread may become distasteful as a steady diet. 
To vary it with the long line of splendid substitutes which 
are possible, and which are discussed in this chapter, is a 
most desirable ability. This department, therefore, is worthy 
of every housewife's devout study. 



I.-BREAD. 

ESSENTIALS TO MAKING GOOD BREAD ; HOW TO KNOW GOOD FLOUR ; 
yeast; RAISING BREAD ; BAKING BREAD. TWELVE RECIPES FOR 
BREAD. 

THREE things are essential to the making of good bread, 
namely, good flour, good yeast, and judicious baking. 
A fourth might be added, experience, without which 
none of the domestic arts can be successfully carried on. 

In selecting flour, first look to the color. If it is white, 
with a yellowish straw-color tint, buy it. If it is white, with 
a bluish cast, or with black specks in it, refuse it. Next, 
examine its adhesiveness ; wet and knead a little of it be- 

126 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 127 

tween your fingers ; if it works soft and sticky, it is poor. 
Then throw a little lump of dried flour against a smooth 
surface ; if it falls like powder, it is bad. Lastly, squeeze 
some of the flour tightly in your hand; if it retains the 
shape given by the pressure, that too is a good sign. It is 
safe to buy flour that will stand all these tests. 

Good yeast may easily be obtained in cities, in the form 
of fresh yeast cakes or at the baker shops. Where access 
cannot be had to these aids, home-made yeast must be 
depended on, which see under " Yeast," at the end of this 
chapter. After the yeast is properly added, the dough must 
stand several hours in an even temperature of moderate 
warmth, so that the process of " rising " may go on. This 
is simply a fermenting, or leavening, or lightening of the 
dough. If this process, by too much heat or other causes, 
goes too fast or too far, sour bread is the result ; if it goes 
too slow, or not far enough, heavy bread is the result. It 
must go just far enough, and just at the right moment the 
process must be arrested by baking. The walls of dough 
which inclose the innumerable vesicles of gas formed in the 
fermenting are thus made firm around those open spaces, 
and what we know as " light bread" is secured. 

The baking is the final test in the case. The oven must 
be just right at the outset, and must be kept so as the 
operation proceeds. Experience must decide the exact heat 
required, but an oven in which the bared arm may be held 
for about half a minute is regarded as approximately 
correct. 

Hot bread, or hot cake, should always be cut with a hot 
knife. If so cut, it will not become clammy. 

RECIPES. 

Wheat Bread. — Put seven pounds of flour into a breadpan ; 
hollow out the centre, and add a quart of lukewarm water, 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a wineglassful of yeast. Have 



1 28 "^^^ ^^ '^^^ WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

ready more warm water, and add gradually as much as will 
make a smooth, soft dough. Knead it well, dust a little 
flour over it, cover it with a cloth, and set it in a warm place 
four hours ; then knead it again for fifteen minutes and let 
it rise again. Divide it into loaves, and prick them with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven from forty minutes to an 
hour. 

Potato Bread. — Three and one-half quarts of sifted flour, 
three boiled potatoes, one quart warm water, one teacupful 
of yeast, one even tablespoonful salt. Mix at night ; put 
the flour in a large bowl ; hollow a place in the centre for 
the mashed potatoes, water, and salt. Stir in flour enough 
to make a smooth batter; add yeast; stir in the rest of the 
flour. Put the dough on the floured board ; knead fifteen 
minutes, using barely enough flour to prevent sticking. 
Flour the bowl, lay the dough in it, cover and leave it to 
rise. In the morning, divide in four parts ; mold into loaves; 
when light, prick, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Salt Rising Bread. — Pour a pint of hot water in a two-quart 
pail or pitcher on one-half tablespoonful of salt ; when it 
has cooled a little, add one and one-third pints of flour ; 
mix well, and leave the pitcher in a kettle of water, as warm 
as that used for mixing. Keep it at the same temperature 
until the batter is nearly twice its original bulk, which will 
be in from five to eight hours. It may be stirred once or 
twice during the rising. Add to this a sponge made of one 
quart of hot water, two and one-half quarts of flour — adding 
as much more as may be necessary to make a soft dough ; 
mix well, and leave in a warm place to rise. When light, 
mold into loaves, keeping them as soft as possible ; lay in 
buttered tins. When light again, prick and bake. 

Milk Bread. — Let two quarts of milk come to a boil ; stand 
it aside to cool, and when it becomes tepid, add flour to it 
gradually until it makes a batter just soft enough to beat up 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 129 

with a spoon. To this add one cake of compressed yeast 
thoroughly dissolved in lukewarm water. The batter should 
then be well beaten. Cover with a towel and set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, add two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
one of lard, one of light brown sugar, and flour enough to 
make a soft dough. Knead steadily for about half an hour. 
This quantity should make four or five mediurh-sized loaves. 
Put them in" greased pans and let them rise again. "When 
light, prick with a fork and bake in a quick oven. 

"Vienna Bread. — The Vienna bread that became so famous 
on the Centennial Exhibition grounds in 1876 was made on 
the following recipe : Sift in a tin pan four pounds of flour ; 
bank up against the sides ; pour in one quart of milk and 
water, and mix into it enough flour to form a thin batter, 
and then quickly and lightly add one pint of milk, in which 
is dissolved one ounce of salt and one and three-quarter 
ounces of yeast ; leave the remainder of the flour against 
the sides of the pan ; cover the pan with a cloth, and set in 
a place free from draught for three quarters of an hour ; 
then mix in the rest of the flour until the dough will leave 
the bottom and sides of the pan, and let it stand two and a 
half hours ; finally, divide the mass into one-pound pieces, 
to be cut in turn into twelve parts each ; this gives square 
pieces about three and a half inches thick, each corner of 
which is taken up and folded over to the centre, and then 
the cases are turned over on a dough-board to rise for half 
an hour, when they are put in a hot oven that will bake 
them in ten minutes. 

Rye Bread. — Scald two handfuls of corn-meal with a quart 
of boiling water, and add a quart of milk and a tablespoonful 
of salt. "When cool, add a teacupful of yeast, and enough 
rye flour to make it as stiff as wheat-bread dough. After 
it has risen put it in pans and bake an hour and a half 

Brown Bread. — Take one cup ot "bread-crumbs, one pint of 
9 



130 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sweet milk, one cup of molasses, butter the size of an ^^^^ 
one teaspoonful of soda, corn-meal enough to make a stiff 
batter, with salt to taste. Turn the whole into a buttered 
basin and steam for two hours ; then bake in a quick oven 
half an hour. 

Boston Brown Bread. — Take three and three-fourth cupfuls 
of Indian corn-meal, two and one-half cupfuls rye-meal, two- 
thirds cupful molasses, one quart milk, either sweet or sour; 
two even teaspoonfuls soda, dissolved in the milk ; steam in 
a tin pudding boiler five hours ; take off the cover and set 
in the oven to brown. 

Com Bread. — Two heaping cupfuls Indian meal, one cup- 
ful wheat flour, two heaping teaspoonfuls Durkee's baking- 
powder; mix well together while dry; one teaspoonful salt, 
two tablespoonfuls white sugar, two eggs, one tablespoonful 
lard, two and a half cupfuls cold milk ; beat the eggs, melt the 
lard, and dissolve the salt and sugar in the milk before add- 
ing them to the flour ; bake in buttered pans in a quick oven. 

Graliam Bread. — Three quarts of Graham flour ; one quart 
of warm water ; one gill of yeast ; one gill of sirup ; 
one tablespoonful of salt ; one even teaspoonful of soda. 
Mix thoroughly and put in well-buttered pans to rise. Bake 
about an hour and a half. 

This same mixture may be thinned and baked in gem 
pans for Graham gems. 

Rice Bread. — After a pint of rice has been boiled soft, mix 
it with two quarts of rice flour or wheat flour. When cold, 
add half a teaspoonful of yeast, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
enough milk to make a soft dough. When it has risen, 
bake in small buttered pans. 

• Unleavened Bread. — Mix wheat flour into a stiff dough 
with warm water or milk ; add a little lard, or suet, and bake 
in thin cakes. Bake as soon as mixed, and eat hot.

II.— TOAST. 

WHAT TOAST IS GOOD FOR. SIX METHODS OF PREPARING TOAST. 

AS a palatable method of disposing of stale bread, as well 
as to furnish a variety of agreeable dishes, toast is an 
important factor in the culinary economy of the home. 
As a dish for invalids it is indispensible. 

RECIPES. 

Dry Toast is produced by browning stale baker's bread 
over glowing coals. A toasting fork, or rack, of which 
there are various patterns, is a great convenience. Do not 
burn the toast, nor allow it to be so browned as to harden it. 
It should be eaten- hot, as it becomes tough when allowed 
to cool. 

Buttered Toast. — For buttered toast, the slices should be 
thicker than for dry toast. Butter the slices as toasted, and 
keep warm until served. Excessive buttering should be 
avoided. 

Egg Toast. — On slices of buttered toast lay poached eggs. 
Serve with Worcestershire sauce for breakfast. 

French Toast. — Beat three eggs light, add one cupful of 
milk, with pepper and salt to taste. Dip into this slices of 
bread, then fry them in hot butter to a delicate brown. 

Milk Toast. — Toast the bread an even, delicate brown, and 
pile into a hot dish. Boil milk with a litde salt, a teaspoon- 
ful of flour, and one of butter, rubbed together ; pour it over 
the toast and serve hot. 

Cream Toast. — Take slices of baker's bread from which 
the crust has been pared and toast it to a golden brown. 
Have on the range a shallow bowl or pudding-dish, more 
than half full of boiling water, in which a tablespoonful of 
butter has been melted. As each slice is toasted, dip in this 



1 32 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

for a second, sprinkle lightly with salt, and lay in the deep 
heated dish in which it is to be served. Have ready , by the 
time all the bread is toasted, a quart of milk scalding hot, 
but not boiling. Thicken this with two tablespoonfuls of 
corn-starch or best flour ; let it simmer until cooked ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of butter, and when this is melted, the 
beaten whites of three eggs. Boil up once, and pour over 
the toast, lifting the lower slices one by one, that the creamy 
mixture may run in between them. Cover closely, and 
set in the oven two or three minutes before serving. 



III.— FANCY BREADS. 

FANCY BREADS AND PLAIN CAKES ; THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS. 
SEVEN RECIPES FOR FANCY BREADS. 

SOME Special preparations come naturally between bread 
and cake. For convenient classification, they are 
grouped here under the title of Fancy Breads, though 
they might as well be classed as Plain Cakes. They serve 
a good purpose for variety, for luncheon, etc. See plainer 
forms of cakes. 

RECIPES. 

SaJly Lumi. — One quart of flour, a piece of butter the size 
of an ^^%, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, two eggs, two tea- 
cupfuls of milk, two teaspoonfuls of cream tartar, one of 
soda, and a little salt. Scatter the cream of tartar, the sugar, 
and the salt into the flour ; add the eggs, the butter (melted), 
and one cup of milk ; dissolve the soda in the remaining cup, 
and stir all together steadily a few moments. Bake in two 
round pans. 

SaUy Limn, No. 2. — Rub into a quart of flour two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder ; beat together nearly half a cup of 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. J 33 

butter and two tablespoonfuls of sugar ; put into the flour 
and mix with a pint of milk ; then add two eggs, beaten 
light. Mix and bake as above. 

Johnny Cake. — One quart of buttermilk or sour milk, one 
quart Indian meal, one quart of flour, one cup of molasses, 
a teaspoonful of soda, two scant teaspoonfuls if the milk is 
sour, a teaspoonful of salt. Bake in shallow pans in a quick 
oven. 

H08 Cake. — Scald one quart of Indian-meal in enough water 
to make a thick batter ; add a teaspoonful of salt, one of 
molasses, and two of butter. Bake on a board before a hot 
fire or in a pan. 

Scotcli Short-cake. — Two pounds of fine flour, one pound 
of fresh, sweet butter, half a pound of finest sifted sugar ; 
throughly knead together without water ; roll out to 
half an inch in thickness, and place it on paper in a shallow 
pan ; bake very slowly until of proper crispness. The cake, 
to be good, must be very brittle. 

Pumpkin Bread. — Stew and strain a sufficient quantity of 
pumpkin ; add enough Indian-meal to stiffen it, with yeast 
and a little salt ; when sufficiently raised, bake as in ordi- 
nary bread. 

Pone. — This is a dish prepared by the Indians, called also 
paune. Take two cupfuls of corn-meal, two of wheat flour, 
one of sugar, and half a cup of melted butter. Add one 
^Z'g, one teaspoonful of salt, one of soda, and two of cream 
of tartar. Mix with enough milk to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in a hot oven. 

Barley Bread. — In Scotland, Norway, and other climates 
where wheat is not grown, barley bread is used extensively. 
It is both wholesome and palatable. Mix the barley meal 
with warm water and a little salt, but no yeast. Mix to a 
stiff dough, roll into flat cakes, and bake before the fire or 
in an oven. Eat hot, with butter.

IV.— ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE BREAKFAST DISH. SEVEN VARIETIES OF ROLLS. 

A FAVORITE departure from the ordinary forms of 
bread is furnished in rolls. They are exceedingly pop- 
ular for breakfast, served warm. There are sufficient 
variations in rolls to make them suitable for use day after 
day, if this be desired. 

RECIPES. 

: Plain Rolls. — Boil six potatoes in two quarts of water, and 
when done pour and press the whole through the colander ; 
when cool, but not cold, add flour to make a thick batter ; 
add half a cup of yeast, or one-half cake of compressed yeast, 
and set to rise ; when light, add half a cup of lard and but- 
ter mixed, a tablespoonful of sugar, teaspoonful of salt, and 
flour to make a soft dough ; knead well and set again to 
rise ; when light, knead down again ; repeat three or four 
times ; an hour before they are to be used cut in small 
pieces, roll out, spread with melted butter, and fold over, 
laying them in a pan so that they will not touch each other ; 
set them in a warm place, and when light bake quickly. Or, 
make into an oblong roll without spreading and rolling, and 
just before putting them into the oven, gash deeply across 
the top with a sharp knife. 

EnglLsli RoUs. — Two pounds of flour, two ounces of butter, 
three tablespoonfuls of yeast, one pint of warm milk ; mix 
well together, and set in a warm place to rise ; knead, and 
make into rolls ; let them rise again and bake twenty min- 
utes. 

Breakfast RoUs. — One quart of sifted flour, three teaspoon- 
fuls baking-powder, half teaspoonful salt; mix well together 
dry, then add three and half gills of cold milk, or enough 
to make it the consistency of batter, and drop with a spoon 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. I35 

into gem baking-pans, which should have been previously 
heated very hot and buttered. 

French Rolls. — One pint of milk, scalded ; put into it while 
hot half a cupful of sugar, and one tablespoonful of butter ; 
when the milk is cool, add a little salt and half a cupful of 
yeast, or one cake of compressed yeast ; stir in flour enough 
to make a stiff sponge, and when light mix as for bread. 
Let it rise until light, punch it down with the hand, and let 
it rise again, and repeat this process two or three times ; 
then turn the dough on to the molding board, and pound 
with rolling-pin until thin enough to cut. Cut out with a 
tumbler, brush the surface of each one with melted butter, 
and fold over. Let the rolls rise on the tins ; bake, and 
while warm brush over the surface with melted butter to 
make the crust tender. 

Vienna Rolls. — One quart sifted flour, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls Durkee's baking-powder; mix well while dry; then 
add a tablespoonful of butter or lard, made a little soft by 
warming and stirring, and about three-fourths of a pint,* or 
enough cold, sweet milk for a dough of usual stiffness, with 
about half a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Mix into a 
dough easily to be handled without sticking ; turn on the 
board and roll out to the thickness of half an inch, cut it 
out with a large cake-cutter, spread very lightly with butter, 
fold one-half over the other, and lay them in a greased pan 
without touching. Wash them over with a little milk, and 
bake in a hot oven. 

Parker House Rolls. — One teacupful of yeast, or one cake 
of compressed yeast, a little salt, one tablespoonful sugar, 
piece of lard size of an ^%%, one pint milk, flour sufficient to 
mix. Put the milk on the stove to scald with the lard in it. 
Prepare the flour with salt, sugar, and yeast. Then add the 
milk, not too hot. Knead thoroughly, and when mixed set 
to rise ; when light, knead again slightly. Then roll out 



136 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

and cut with large biscuit-cutter. Spread a little butter on 
each roll and lap together. Let them rise again very light, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Geneva Rolls.— Into two pounds of flour break three 
ounces of butter, add a little salt, and make into a sponge 
with yeast, previously mixed with milk and water. Allow 
the batter to rise ; then mix in two egg's, made lukewarm 
by the adding of hot milk, and work the sponge to a light 
dough. Let it stand for three-quarters of an hour longer ; 
mold into small rolls ; place them in buttered pans. When 
light, brush them with beaten yelks of eggs, and bake for 
twenty minutes or half an hour. Serve hot. 



v.— BISCUIT, RUSK, AND BUNS. 

SPECIAL CARE REQUISITE IN THIS DEPARTMENT ; ATTENTION TO 
INGREDIENTS, OVEN, ETC. ; HOW TO BAKE THEM; BAKING-POW- 
DER BISCUITS, SODA BISCUITS, ETC. j CARE OF PANS. FIFTEEN 
RECIPES FOR BISCUITS, BUNS, ETC. 

GREAT care Is requisite in making biscuits that quantities 
be accurately observed and that the ingredients used 
are of proper quality. Flour should be a few months 
old. New flour will not make good biscuits. It should 
always be sifted. 

The oven, too, needs careful attention. On Its condition 
the success of biscuit baking will depend. Rolls and bis- 
cuit should bake quickly. To make them a nice color, rub 
them over with warm water just before putting them into 
the oven ; to glaze them, brush lightly with milk and sugar. 
Baking-powder biscuit and soda biscuit should be made 
as rapidly as possible, laid into hot pans, and put in a 
quick oven. Gem pans should always be heated and well 
greased. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 137 

RECIPES. 

Potato Biscuit. — Pare ten potatoes, boil them thoroughly, 
and mash fine ; add two cups of lukewarm milk, two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, half a cup of yeast, and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. Mix well and allow it to 
rise. Then add four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a little 
salt, and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let this rise 
again ; roll into a sheet about an inch thick, and cut into 
cakes. Set to rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 

Light Biscuit. — When kneading bread, set aside a small 
loaf for biscuits. Into this, work a heaping tablespoonful of 
lard and butter mixed and a teaspoonful of sugar. The 
more it is worked the whiter it will be. As it rises, 
mold it down twice before making into biscuit. Roll out 
and cut with a biscui.t-cutter. The dough should be quite 
soft. 

Soda Biscuits. — One quart of flour, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and two of lard, a teaspoonful of salt, and one teaspoon 
even full of cream of tartar, one teaspoonful of soda ; sift 
the cream tartar with the flour dry ; rub the butter and lard 
very thoroughly through it ; dissolve the soda in a pint of 
milk and mix all together. Roll out, adding as little flour 
as possible ; cut with a biscuit-cutter, and bake twenty 
minutes in a quick oven. 

Tea Biscuit. — Take one quart sifted flour, one tablespoon- 
ful shortening, half teaspoonful salt, and two teaspoonfuls 
Durkee's baking-powder ; mix well together dry, then add 
sufficient cold milk or water to form a very soft dough ; 
bake immediately in a quick oven. 

Cream Biscuits. — Dissolve one teaspoonful of soda in a 
quart of sour cream, add to it flour sufficient to make a soft 
dough and a little salt ; or use sour milk, and rub a table- 
spoonful of butter into the flour. 



138 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Graham Biscuits. — Take one quart of water or milk, butter 
the size of an ^^^, three tablespoonfuls sugar, two of baker's 
yeast, and a pinch of salt ; take enough white flour to use 
up the water, making it the consistency of batter cakes ; 
add the rest of the ingredients and as much Graham flour 
as can be stirred in with a spoon ; set it away till morning ; 
in the morning grease the pan, flour your hands ; take a 
lump of dough the size of a large ^^^, roll it lightly be- 
tween the palms, and let the biscuits rise twenty minutes, 
then bake in a tolerably hot oven. 

Maryland Biscuits. — Take three pints of sifted flour, one 
tablespoonful of good lard, one pint of cold water, salt to 
the taste; make into a stiff dough; work it till it cracks or 
blisters, then break, but do not cut it, into suitable portions, 
and make into biscuits ; stick the top of each with a fork 
and bake. 

YorksMre Biscuits. — Make a batter with flour sufficient and 
one quart of boiling hot milk. When the batter has cooled 
to lukewarmness, add a teacupful of yeast and a half tea- 
spoonful of salt. Set to rise again and let it become very 
light ; then stir in a half teaspoonful of soda, two eggs, and 
a tablespoonful of melted butter. Add flour enough to 
make the dough into small, round cakes ; let them rise fifteen 
minutes, and bake in a slow oven. 

Short Biscuits. — Mix one quart of flour with a quarter 
pound of butter melted in boiling water. Add enough cold 
milk to make a stiff dough. Work into small biscuits and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Flavored Biscuits. — Biscuit dough made as for Light Bis- 
cuit may be flavored with any essence, or with lemon or 
orange peel, as desired. 

Tea Rusk. — Three cups of flour, one cup of milk, three-

fourths of a cup of sugar, two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
butter, melted ; two eggs, three teaspoonfuls baking-powder. 
Let them rise, and bake in a moderate oven. Glaze while 
hot with white of ^^^, in which has been stirred, not beaten, 
a little powdered sugar, or sift the powdered sugar in while 
the Q:^^ is still moist on the top. Rusks should never be 
eaten hot. 

Sweet Rusk. — One pint of warm milk — new is best — one- 
half cup of butter, one cup of sugar, two eggs, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of yeast ; make a sponge 
with the milk, yeast, and enough flour to make a thin bat- 
ter, and let it rise over night. In the morning add the 
sugar, butter, eggs, and salt, well beaten up together, with 
enough flour to make a soft dough ; let it rise again ; then 
work out into round balls, and set to rise a third time. Bake 
in a moderate oven. 

Buns. — One cupful of warm water, one cupful of sweet milk, 
yeast and sugar, with flour enough to make a stiff batter ; 
let this rise over night ; in the morning add a cupful of 
sugar, a cupful of raisins or currants, mold well ; let it rise till 
light, then make into buns ; rise again till very light, and 
bake. Use any spice desired. 

Hot Cross Buns. — Three cupfuls sweet rhilk ; one cupful of 
yeast ; flour to make thick batter. Set this as a sponge over 
night. In the morning add one cupful of sugar ; one-half 
cupful butter, melted ; half a nutmeg ; one saltspoonful salt, 
and flour enough to roll out like biscuit. Knead well, and 
set to rise five hours. Roll half an inch thick, cut into 
round cakes, and lay in rows in a buttered baking-pan. 
When they have stood half an hour, make a cross upon 
each with a knife, and put instantly into the oven. Bake to 
a light brown, and brush over with a feather or soft bit of 
rag, dipped in the white of an Q'g^ beaten up stiff with white 
sugar. 



140 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

Pop Overs. — Mix four cupfuls of flour, four cupfuls of 
milk, four eggs, and a little salt. This quantity will make 
about twenty puffs in gem-pans, which must be baked quick 
and done to a nice brown. 



VI.— MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

HOW MUFFINS AND WAFFLES DIFFER ; THEIR RELATION TO OTHER 
KINDRED PREPARATIONS; MUFFIN-RINGS AND WAFFLE-IRONS; 
WHEN TO USE MUFFINS AND WAFFLES ; HOW TO SERVE THEM. 
ELEVEN RECIPES FOR MUFFINS AND WAFFLES. 

MUFFINS are baked in rings on a griddle, or in gem- 
pans, over a quick fire. Waffles are baked in waffle- 
irons, which inclose the batter and imprint both sides 
of the cake as it rises in the process of baking. Both muf- 
fins and waffles form a medium between bread and biscuits 
on the one side and griddle-cakes on the other. Mufifln- 
rings were formerly about four inches in diameter, but now, 
with better taste, they are used much smaller. The approved 
waffle-irons of to-day are circular, baking four waffles at 
once, and suspended on a pivot that permits them to be 
turned with a touch of the fork. Both muffins and waffles 
are suitable for tea, and with stewed chicken and such deli- 
cacies they are really delicious. They should always be 
served hot and with the bes-t of butter. Waffles and catfish 
are a famous dish at some eating-houses. 

RECIPES. 

Muffins. — Two eggs lightly beaten, one quart of flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of Durkee's baking- 
powder, one tablespoonful of melted butter, one pint of 
milk, and two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract, if liked. 
Beat up quickly to the consistency of a cake batter ; bake in 
buttered gem-oans in a hot oven. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 141 

Muffins, No. 2. — One cup of home-made yeast or half of a 
compressed yeast cake, one pint of sweet milk, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. Beat the butter, sugar, and eggs well together ; then 
stir in the milk, slightly warmed, and thicken with flour to 
the consistency of griddle-cakes. When light, bake in muffin- 
rings or on a griddle. If wanted for tea, the batter should 
be mixed immediately after breakfast. Muflins should never 
be cut with a knife, but be pulled open with the fingers. 

Rice Muffins. — Take one quart of sour milk, three well- 
beaten eggs, a little salt, a teaspoonful of soda, and enough 
of rice flour to thicken to a stiff batter. Bake in rings. 

Hominy Muffins. — Substitute hominy, well cooked and 
mashed, for the rice, and proceed as above. 

Bread Muffins. — Cut the crust off four thick slices of bread ; 
put them in a pan and pour on them just enough boiling 
water to soak them thoroughly. Let them stand an hour, 
covered ; then drain off the water and stir the bread to a 
smooth paste. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, a half 
pint of milk, and three well-beaten eggs. Bake to a delicate 
brown in well-buttered muffin-rings. 

Graham Muffins. — One quart of Graham flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, one ^%g, one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, milk enough to make a batter as thick as 
for griddle-cakes. Bake in gem-pans or muffin-rings in a 
hot oven. 

Com Muffins. — Mix two cupfuls of corn-meal, two cupfuls 
of flour, one cupful of sugar, half a cupful of melted butter, 
two eggs, and one teaspoonful of salt. Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful of soda and two of cream tartar in a little milk, and 
beat it through. Add milk enough to make a moderately 
stiff batter, and bake in rings or gem-pans. 



142 ^-^-^ HOUSEWIFE'' S LIBRARY. 

Crumpets. — Three cupfuls of warm milk, half a cupful of 
yeast, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one saltspoonful 
each of salt and soda dissolved in hot water, flour enough 
to make a good batter. Set these ingredients — leaving out 
the butter and soda — as a sponge. When very light, beat 
in the melted butter, with a very little flour ; stir in the soda 
hard, fill patty-pans or muflin-rings with the mixture, and 
let them stand fifteen minutes before baking. 

Raised Waffles. — One quart of warm milk, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, three eggs, one gill of yeast, one tablespoon- 
ful of salt, and flour to make a stiff batter. Set to rise, and 
bake in waffle-irons, which must be well heated before used. 

Quick Waffles. — One quart flour, two teaspoonfuls Durkee's 
baking-powder, one teaspoonful salt ; mix dry ; then stir in 
one tablespoonful melted butter, two well-beaten eggs, and 
enough cold, sweet milk for a batter thin enough to pour ; 
bake at once in waffle-irons. 

Rice Waffles. — Mix a teacupful and a half of boiling rice 
with a pint of milk, rubbing it smooth over the fire. Take 
from the fire and add a pint of cold milk and a teaspoonful 
of salt. Stir in four well-beaten eggs with enough flour to 
make a thin batter, and bake as above. Waffles should 
always be served hot. Powdered sugar with a flavor of 
powdered cinnamon makes a pleasing dressing for them.

CAKES made of a batter so thin that it flows easily upon 
a griddle, and that can, therefore, be quickly baked 
and be served hot, are griddle-cakes, and great favorites 
they are. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. I43 

All new griddles are hard to manage, but as the only way 
to get old ones is to make them out of new ones, we are 
shut up to the necessity of using the new, though they do 
not work so well. Opinions divide between iron griddles 
and those of soapstone. The latter require no greasing. 
Hence trouble is saved, and the smoke of the fat used in 
the constant greasing of a hot iron griddle is entirely 
avoided. But still, many housekeepers prefer the old style. 

A hot griddle is essential to good griddle-cakes. But it 
must not be hot enough to burn before it bakes. A cold 
griddle will make cakes tough, unpalatable, and decidedly 
unwholesome. 

Hot cakes may be served with powdered sugar, molasses, 
maple sirup, or any other of the many excellent sirups in 
the market. Cold days are the gala days for hot cakes. 
Time immemorial, buckwheat cakes and sausage have gone 
to the table side by side. There is delightful harmony in 
this union ; but to serve hot cakes and fish together would 
introduce discord into the best regulated family. There is 
an eminent fitness between hot cakes and certain other 
dishes, and it must never be disregarded. 

RECIPES. 

Buckwheat Cakes. — One quart, of buckwheat-meal, one 
pint of wheat-flour or Indian-meal, half a teacupful of yeast, 
salt to taste ; mix the flour, buckwheat, and salt with as 
much water moderately warm as will make it into a thin 
batter ; beat it well, then add the yeast ; when well mixed, 
set it in a warm place to rise ; as soon as it is very light, 
grease the griddle and bake the cakes to a delicate brown. 
Butter them with good butter and serve hot. 

Graham Griddle-cakes. — Scald a cupful of Indian-meal in a 
pint of boiling water, and strain it over night. Thin it with 
a quart of milk, and make into a sponge with a cupful of 



244 = THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Graham flour, a large tablespoonful of molasses, and half a 
cupful of yeast. In the morning, add salt to taste, a cupful 
of white flour, half a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in hot 
water, and a tablespoonful of butter or lard. Stir in enough 
water to make batter of the right consistency, and bake on 
a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes. — Three eggs, one quart of sweet milk, about 
one quart of flour, a small teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of Durkee's baking-powder ; beat the yelks, and 
half of the milk, salt, and flour together ; then the remainder 
of the milk ; and last, the v/hites of the eggs well beaten. 
Bake in small cakes on a hot griddle. 

Flannel Cakes, No. 2. — One quart of milk, three eggs, one 
cupful of yeast, one dessertspoonful of salt, flour enough for 
a thinnish batter, and a teaspoonful of butter ; set to rise ; 
bake like buckwheat cakes. Cakes half Indian and half 
wheat are very nice, and good cakes may be made even 
without the eggs. 

Rice Cakes. — Soak a cupful of rice five or six hours in 
enough warm water to cover it. Then boil slowly till soft. 
While still warm, but not hot, stir in a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, a tablespoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
quart of milk. When cold, add three eggs, beaten very 
light. Sift a half teaspoonful of cream of tartar into a 
quarter cupful of rice flour, and add them to the batter, first 
beating into it a quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot 
water. 

Rice Cakes, No. 2. — Boil a cupful of rice until quite soft, 
setting it aside until cool. Beat three eggs very light, and 
put them into the rice, with a pint of flour, into which you 
have sifted three teaspoonfuls of Durkee's baking-powder. 
Add a teaspoonful of butter and one of salt, making it into 
a batter with a quart of milk. Bake on a griddle. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. I45 

Hominy Cakes. — Mix with cold boiled hominy an equal 
quantity of white flour until perfectly smooth ; add a tea- 
spoonful of salt and thin off with buttermilk, in part of 
which a teaspoonful of soda has been dissolved ; when of 
the proper consistency for griddle cakes, add a dessertspoon- 
ful of melted butter, and bake as usual. 

Sour Milk Cakes. — One pint sour milk, one teaspoonful of 
soda, a little salt, two eggs, and flour to make a thin batter ; 
bake on a hot griddle. 

Indian Griddle Cakes. — One large cupful Indian-meal, four 
tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of Durkee's 
baking-powder, one teaspoonful salt, mix together dry, then 
add sufficient cold water for a batter ; bake at once on a hot 
griddle. 

Slapjacks. — One pint of milk, three eggs, one teaspoonful 
of soda, and one of salt, flour enough to make a thin bat- 
ter. Butter your griddle, and fry them the size of a tea- 
plate ; when one is done, turn it on the dish, sprinkle with a 
little white sugar, and continue in this way till they are all 
fried. Always fry them with butter. A little nutmeg may 
be grated with the sugar on each cake. 



VIII.— YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 

NATURE OF YEAST ; ACTION OF YEAST IN DOUGH ; CAUSES OF LIGHT 
BREAD AND HEAVY BREAD ; CARE OF YEAST. RECIPES FOR YEAST 
AND YEAST CAKES. 

IN this chapter, yeast has been so often referred to that its 
special consideration^ seems important just here. An- 
alytically considered, it consists of an innumerable 
quantity of infinitesimal fungi, called the yeast-plant. The 
remarkable characteristic of these minute plants is, that 
under favoring conditions they multiply to an incredible 



146 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

extent in a very short time. Thus the production of yeast, 
in proper mixtures, is an easy matter. 

When yeast is placed in dough, it immediately produces 
fermentation, in the process of which gases are generated, 
which permeate the dough, filling it with gas-vessels and so 
producing the spongy appearance so familiar in raised 
bread. If this process goes too far, it sours the dough and 
unfits it for food. If arrested by placing the dough in a 
hot oven, the gases will be driven off by the heat, and the 
thin dough walls will be set and baked. If the oven be 
slow, the gases will be driven off, the dough walls will col- 
lapse, and heavy bread will be the result. The proper use 
of yeast is most important, therefore. It must be watched 
as carefully as any other tender plant. Excessive heat or 
cold, or rough mechanical usage will quickly destroy it. 

RECIPES. 

Brewer's Yeast. — This yeast is produced during the process 
of fermenting malt liquors. It is the most effective yeast 
in use, being about eight times the strength of any other 
kind. 

Hop Yeast. — Boil four pounds of pared potatoes in three 
quarts of water and stir through a colander. Boil a hand- 
ful of hops in one quart of water for ten minutes, and strain 
this upon the potatoes. Add a half pint of salt, a half pint of 
sugar, and a tablespoonful of ginger. The quantity should 
now measure five quarts. If it be less, add enough tepid 
water to make the quantity correct. When lukewarm, add 
a half pint of home-brewed yeast, mix thoroughly, and 
stand in a warm place till bubbles form on the surface, which 
indicate that it has become light. Cover the vessel contain- 
ing the yeast, and allow it to stand in a dry, cool place. It 
will keep well for months. A gill of this yeast will suffice 
for an ordinary baking, requiring a quart of water or milk. 



BREAD, BISCUIT, HOT CAKES, ETC. 147 

Patent Yeast. — Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of 
water for a half hour. Strain and cool till lukewarm, then 
add a handful of salt, a half pound of sugar, and a pound 
of flour, all mixed well and beaten up together. After it 
has stood forty-eight hours, add three pounds of potatoes, 
boiled and well-mashed. Let it stand twenty-four hours, 
stirring it often ; then strain and bottle. It is ready for im- 
mediate use, or will keep several months. Keep in a cool 
place. 

Potato Yeast. — Pare and boil six potatoes; mash them 
through a colander and mix with them six tablespoonfuls of 
flour. Pour on a quart of boiling water from that in which 
the potatoes were boiled. Add half a teacupful of sugar, a 
tablespoonful of salt, and when cool, a teacupful of home- 
made yeast, or one-fourth the quantity of brewer's yeast. 

Yeast Cakes. — Thicken good yeast with Indian-meal till it 
becomes a stiff batter. A little rye will make it adhere bet- 
ter. Make into cakes an inch thick and two by three inches 
in area. Dry them in the air, but not in the sun. Keep 
them in a bag in a cool, dry place. One of these cakes is 
enough for four quarts of flour. To use them, soak in 
milk or water several hours and use as other yeast. 

Compressed Yeast. — There are many valuable preparations 
of this yeast, excellent in quality, and convenient to use. 
They must be fresh, however, or they will fail of their pur- 
pose.

FOR pastry and PUDDINGS. 

THAT pastry may be wholesome and appetizing, great 
care in the selection of ingredients and in their ma- 
nipulation is absolutely essential. One fact must 
always be borne in mind — that inferior ingredients cannot be 
made into superior compounds — though the finest ingre- 
dients may be ruined by careless or unskillful handling. 
Some suggestions of general application are therefore de- 
sirable. 

Be careful to have all the materials cool, and the butter and 
lard hard ; use cold water (ice-water if convenient) ; use a 
cool knife, and work on a marble slab if it can be had. 

Put the ingredients together quickly, handling as little as 
possible ; slow mixing and much contact with the hands 
or fingers make tough crust. Always use well-sifted flour. 

Except in puff-paste, lard and butter in about equal pro- 
portions make the best crust ; if made of butter alone, it is 
almost sure to be tough. That of lard alone, though ten- 
der, is usually white and insipid. Beef drippings, or the 
drippings of fresh pork, make a very light and palatable 
crust, lighter and more tender indeed than that made with 
butter alone, much better tasted than that made with lard 
alone, and quite equal to that made with butter and lard 
combined. Never use mutton drippings in crust. 

Use very little salt and very little water; pour the latter 
in gradually, only a few drops at a time, unless you want 
tough crust.

PASTRY AND PUDDINGS, * 149 

Use plenty of flour on your paste-board, to keep the paste 
from sticking. Work the crust of one pie at a time, and 
always roll from you — one way only. 

The filling for the pie should be perfectly cool when put 
in, or it will make the bottom crust heavy. 

In making juicy pies, cut a slit in the top to let the steam 
escape, else the pie will be puffed unduly. 

The oven should be hot, but not sufficiently so to scorch 
or to set the paste before it has had time to rise ; if too 
slack, the paste will not rise at all, but will,, be white and 
clammy. The best paste has a tinge of yellow. If per- 
mitted to scorch or brown, even the best paste becomes 
rancid. 

RECIPES. 

Pie Crust. — Take one-half cupful of lard, one-half cupful 
of butter, one quart of sifted flour, one cupful of cold water 
and a little salt. Rub the butter and lard slightly into the 
flour ; wet it with the water, mixing it as little as possible. 
This quantity will make two large or three small pies. 

Pie Crust Glaze. — To prevent juice from soaking the under 
crust, beat up the white of an ^%^, and before filling the pie, 
brush over the crust with the beaten ^%g. Brush over the 
top crust also, to give it a beautiful yellow brown. 

Puff Paste. — Take one pound of sifted flour, on which 
sprinkle a very little sugar; take the yelks of one or two 
eggs, and beat into them a little ice-water, and pour gently 
into the centre of the flour, and work into a firm paste, 
adding water as is necessary; divide three-quarters of a 
pound or a pound of firm, solid butter, as you prefer, into 
three parts ; roll out the paste, and spread one part of tlie 
butter on half of the paste ; fold the other half over, and 
roll out again, repeating the process until the butter is all 
rolled in ; then set the paste on the ice for fifteen or twenty 



150 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

minutes, after which roll out again three times, each time 
rolling it the opposite direction ; then put on the ice again 
until cold, when it is ready for use. Such paste will keep 
several days in a refrigerator, but should not be allowed to 
freeze. 

Paste Shells. — Take sufficient rich puff-paste prepared as 
in the preceding recipe, roll very thin, cut to shape, and bake 
in a brisk oven in tin pans. Baked carefully, before fill- 
ing with fruit, the paste rises better. When cool, the shells 
may be filled with stewed fruit, jelly, preserves, rich cream 
whipped to a stiff froth, raspberries, strawberries, or sliced 
peaches. These are delicious light desserts. Raspberries, 
strawberries, or sliced peaches, smothered with whipped 
cream on these shells, are really exquisite. 

Apple Pie. — Line a pie plate with paste, and fill it heaping 
full with tart apples, sliced very thin. Sweeten and spice to 
taste, mixing well into the apples. Put in plenty of butter, 
and moisten well with cream. Bake until the apples are 
thoroughly done. Use no upper crust. 

Apple Meringue Pie. — Stew and sweeten ripe, juicy apples. 
Mash smooth, and season with nutmeg. Fill the crust, and 
bake until just done. Spread over the apple a thick me- 
ringue, made by whipping to a stiff froth the whites of three 
eggs tor each pie, sweetening with a tablespoonful of pow- 
dered sugar for each ^^^. Flavor this with vanilla ; beat 
until it will stand alone, and cover the pie three-quarters of 
an inch thick. Set back in the oven until the meringue is 
well set. Eat cold. 

Peach Meringue Pie. — Proceed as above in all respects, 
simply substituting peaches for apples. Whipped cream 
will make a delightful substitute for the whipped ^^g in 
either of these meringue pies. 

Peach Pie. — Bake rich shells about two-thirds done ; if 
your peaches are fully ripe, cut them into hal\«es or quarters, 



PASTRY AND PUDDINGS. \^\ 

put in the shell, sweeten and flavor to taste, cover or not as 
you choose, and finish baking" in a quick oven ; if the 
peaches are ripe, but not soft, it will improve the flavor to 
sugar them down some hours before you wish to use them ; 
if not ripe, they should be stewed. 

Gooseberry Pie. — Stew the gooseberries with plenty of 
white sugar, and use plain puff-paste for crust. 

Cherry Pie. — Having removed the stones, put in sugar as 
may be needed, and stew the cherries slowly till they are 
quite done, if you use shells, or till nearly done if you use 
paste. A few of the pits added in stewing increase the 
richness of the flavor ; but they should not go into the pies. 
If baked slowly the cherries need not be stewed at all. 

Rhubarb Pie. — Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them 
in small pieces ; pour boiling water over and let stand for 
ten minutes ; drain thoroughly ; then fill the pie-dish evenly 
full ; put in plenty of sugar, a little butter, and dredge a 
trifle of flour evenly over the top ; cover with* a thin crust, 
and bake the same as apple pie. Equal quantities of apple 
and rhubarb used in the same manner make a very good pie. 

Pumpkia Pie. — Stew the pumpkin until thoroughly done, 
and pass it through a colander. To one quart of stewed 
pumpkin, add three eggs, and one pint of milk. Sweeten, 
and spice with ground ginger and cinnamon to taste. Add 
butter, rose water, and a little brandy. The quantity of 
milk used will vary as the pumpkin may be moist or dry. 

Sweet Potato Pie. — Scrape clean two good-sized sweet pota- 
toes ; boil ; when tender, rub through the colander ; beat 
the yelks of three eggs light ; stir with a pint of sweet milk 
into the potato ; add a small teacupful of sugar, a pinch of 
salt; flavor with a little fresh lemon, or lemon extract; 
bake to a nice brown ; when done, make a meringue top with 
the whites of eggs and powdered sugar ; brown this a 
moment in the oven. 



152 ' THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Custard Pie. — Take one quart of milk, five eggs, four table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, a small piece of butter. Sift over the 
top Durkee's mixed spice. 

Lemon Pie. — Let two cupfuls of water come to a boil ; put 
in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch dissolved. When it 
has boiled enough, take it from the stove, add the juice and 
rind of two lemons, two cupfuls of sugar, a piece of butter 
the size of a walnut, and the yelks of two eggs. Beat the 
whites of these eggs with pulverized sugar, and put on the 
top of the pies when done. Put into the oven to brown. 

Orange Pie. — Beat the yelks of three eggs until light, and 
add to them the juice and grated rind of one orange, three- 
quarters of a cupful of sugar, and a tablespoonful of corn- 
starch mixed in half a cupful of water. Bake without 
upper crust, using the whites of the eggs for meringue. 

Cream Pie» — One pint of milk, scalded ; two tablespoonfuls 
of corn-starch, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, yelks of two 
eggs. Wet the starch with a little cold milk ; beat the eggs 
and sugar until light, and stir the whole into the scalding 
milk. Flavor with lemon or vanilla, and set aside to cool. 
Line a plate with pie-crust and bake ; fill it with the cream, 
and cover with frosting made of the whites of the eggs, 
beaten dry, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Bake to a 
delicate brown. 

Cocoanut Pie. — One quart of milk, half a pound of grated 
cocoanut, three eggs, six tablespoonfuls of sugar, butter the 
size of an ^^"g. Bake in open shells. 

Cheese-cake Pie. — This may be made from the above recipe, 
substituting cottage-cheese for the cocoanut. Sprinkle the 
top with Durkee's mixed spices. 

Mince Pie. — Seven pounds of beef, three and a half pounds 
of beef suet, five pounds of raisins, two pounds of currants, 
one-half peck of apples, four pounds of sugar, three-quarters

of a pound of citron, one-quarter of a pound of preserved 
lemon, two large oranges, four nutmegs, half an ounce of 
cinnamon, half an ounce of cloves, and three pints of brandy. 
This quantity of mince-meat will make from twenty to 
twenty-five pies. When making the pies, moisten the meat 
with sweet cider. 

Tarts. — Use the best of puff-paste ; roll it out a little 
thicker than pie-crust, and cut with a large biscuit-cutter 
twice as many as you intend to have of tarts. Then cut 
out of half of these a small round in the centre, which will 
leave a circular rim of crust ; lift this up carefully, and lay 
it on the other pieces. Bake in pans, so providing both the 
bottom and the top crusts. Fill with any kind of preserves, 
jam, or jelly. 

Pineapple Tart. — Take a fine, large, ripe pineapple; re- 
move the leaves and quarter it without paring, grate it down 
till you come to the rind ; strew plenty of powdered sugar 
over the grated fruit; cover it, and let it rest for an hour; 
then put it into a porcelain kettle, and steam in its own sirup 
till perfectly soft ; have ready some empty shells of puff- 
paste, or bake in patty-pans. When they are cool, fill them 
full with the grated pineapple; add more sugar, and lay 
round the rim a border of puff-paste. 

Tea Baskets. — Make a short, sweetened pie-crust ; roll thin, 
and partly bake in sheets ; before it is quite done take from 
the oven, cut in squares of four inches or so, take up two 
diagonal corners and pinch together, which makes them 
basket-shaped ; now fill with whipped cream, or white of 
^%'gy or both, well sweetened and flavored, and return to the 
oven for a few minutes. 

Strawberry Short-cake. — Make a good biscuit crust, and 
roll out about one-quarter of an inch thick, and cut into 
two cakes the same size and shape ; spread one over lightly 
with melted butter, and lay the other over it, and bake in a.

well as usual. Mix the berries with plenty of sugar, and 
set in a warm place until needed. Spread the berries and

has run from the fruit can be sent to the table in a tureen 
and served with the cake as it is cut. 

Strawberry Short-cake, No. 2. — Take one quart of flour and 
sift into it two teaspoonfuls of sea-foam, a little salt, quarter 
of a pound of butter rubbed in, with milk enough to moisten

roll each flat, and place in two jelly pans. Bake quickly, 
then split apart the top and bottom of each crust ; spread on 
plenty of butter, have the strawberries washed and drained 
in a sieve, crush them slightly, and sweeten well. Spread 
plenty of berries over each layer of the crust, and have some 
of the crushed and sweetened berries in a deep dish. When 
the cake is cut and served, cover each piece with the crushed 
berries, using this as sauce. 

Batter Pudding.— Beat the yelks and whites of four eggs 
separately, and mix them with six or eight ounces of flour

LIGHT DESSERTS FOR HOME USE; FROZEN PREPARATIONS; 
FREEZERS ; HOW TO FREEZE CREAMS, ETC. ; HOW TO TURN OUT 
THE MOLDS ; WHIPPED CREAMS, JELLIES, ETC. FORTY-FOUR 

RECIPES FOR CREAMS, JELLIES, BLANC-MANGES, ETC. 

THERE is a delightful range of light desserts which need 
to be introduced more generally into our homes. 
They have too long been allowed to rest in the con- 
fectioner's under the erroneous notion that they were be- 
yond the capacity of the ordinary housekeeper. 

Prominent among these desserts are ice-cream and water- 
ices with all their splendid possibilities of variety. For hints 
concerning freezers and other tools for the home manufac- 
ture of these preparations, see the last chapter of this 
department. 

In making ice-cream, use only the best materials. Avoid 
milk thickened with arrow-root, corn-starch, or any farina- 
ceous substance. Pure cream, ripe natural fruits, or good 
extracts of the same, and sugar of the purest quality, com- 
bine to make a perfect ice-cream. To freeze the cream, 
assuming it be already flavored, first pound up ice and mix 
with it a quantity of coarse salt, in the proportion of about 
one-third the quantity of salt to the amount of ice used. 
Put the freezing-can in the centre of the tub, taking care 
that the lid is securely fastened down, and pile the mixed 
ice and salt around it to within three inches of the top, or 
certainly as high as the cream reaches on the inside. 

Begin to stir the cream at once, and stir rapidly and con- 
stantly. This is essential to make the cream smooth. If 

166 



CREAMS, JELLIES,, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 1^7 

the cream is allowed to freeze to the sides of the can with- 
out being quickly removed, there will inevitably be lumps 
of ice through it. The freezing has progressed sufficiently 
far when the cream will stand heaped upon a spoon. 

When a small can of cream has been made for table use, 
it is desirable to serve it in a cylindrical form as it comes 
solid from the can. To remove it in this form, take the can 
from the ice and wipe off all the salt and ice which adheres 
to it. Remove the lid and invert the can .upon a plate. 
Wrap about the can a towel wet with warm water. This 
will sufficiently relax the freezing within the can to allow 
the cream to slide out in compact form. Molds of 
cream may be removed in the same manner, by dipping 
them in warm water for a moment. Water-ices and frozen 
fruits need the same general treatment. 

For whipping cream, etc., some of the improved beaters, 
described at the end of this department, will be found to be 
superior to the old hand methods. In all delicate dishes the 
best ingredients must invariably be used. 

RECIPES. 

Vanilla Ice-cream. — Two quarts of pure cream, fourteen 
ounces of white sugar, flavored with vanilla bean or extract 
of vanilla to taste ; mix well, and freeze as directed 
above. Pure cream needs no thickening or boiling. Milk 
may be boiled or thickened with arrow-root or corn- 
starch, but it will not produce ice cream. 

Lemon Ice-cream. — For the same quantity of cream and 
sugar, as above, stir in the juice of from four to eight 
lemons, according to size and juiciness, and grate in a little 
of the rind. Then freeze as above. 

Orange Ice-cream. — Proceed as in lemon cream, using 
oranges, and regulating the quantity of sugar as the fruit is 
more or less sweet.

Chocolate Ice-cream. — For one gallon of ice-cream, grate 
fine about one-half cake of Baker's chocolate ; make ice- 
cream as for the recipe above ; jflavor lightly with vanilla 
and stir in the chocolate. 

Strawberry Ice-cream. — Mash one pint of fresh, ripe straw- 
berries ; sprinkle them with half a pound of fine sugar ; let 
it stand about an hour ; strain though a fine sieve, or a 
cloth ; if the sugar is not dissolved, stir it well ; add a little 
water; stir this juice into the cream prepared as above and 
freeze. 

Raspberry Ice-cream. — Make the same as strawberry, sub- 
stituting the raspberries merely. 

Peach Ice-cream. — Take fine, ripe freestone peaches ; pare, 
chop fine, mash, and work as for strawberry cream. 

Pine-apple Ice-cream. — Pare the fruit, shred fine, and work as 
in strawberry cream. 

Orange Water-ice. — Take one dozen oranges ; grate the 
skin and squeeze out the juice; add six quarts of water 
and ten ounces of white sugar to each quart of water ; mix 
well and put into the freezer. Be careful to stir steadily 
while freezing, or the mixture will cake into lumps. The 
amount of sugar and of orange-juice may be varied to suit 
taste. 

Lemon Water-ice. — To one quart of water, add the juice of 
four lemons and one pound of sugar. Then proceed as 
above. Currants, raspberries, strawberries, and all the juicy 
fruits may be treated in the same way.

of sugar ; freeze, and when sufficiently congealed, add one- 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 1^9 

half pound of preserved fruits, with a few white raisins 
chopped, and finely sliced citron. Cut the fruit small, and 
mix well with the cream. Freeze like ice-cream, and keep 
on ice until required. 

Frozen Fruits. — Take two quarts of rich cream and two 
teacupfuls of sugar, mix well together and put into a freezer 
with ice and salt packed around it. Have ready one quart 
of peaches, mashed and sweetened. When the cream is 
very cold, stir them in and freeze all together. Strawberries 
can be used in the same way, but will require more sugar. 
Cherries are specially delightful in this form. 

Whipped Cream. — To one quart of cream whipped very 
thick, add powdered sugar to taste ; then add one tumbler 
of wine. Make just before using. 

Italian Cream. — Divide two pints of cream equally in two 
bowls ; with one bowl mix six ounces of powdered sugar, 
the juice of two large lemons, and two glassfuls of white 
wine ; then add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole 
very hard ; boil two ounces of isinglass with four small tea- 
cupfuls of water till reduced one-half; then stir the isinglass, 
lukewarm, in the other ingredients ; put them in a glass dish 
to harden.

quart of rich cream, and another cupful of sugar into the 
whites of four eggs. Mix these together, and add a glass 
of white wine and flavoring to taste» 

Spanish Cream. — Three half-pints of milk, half a box of 
gelatine, five tablespoonfuls of white sugar, three eggs, and 
two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Soak the gelatine in cold milk ; 
put on to boil ; when boiling, add the yelks of the eggs 
with the sugar and flavoring extract beaten together. When 
it thickens to the consistency of cream, or after about three

minutes' boiling, take off the fire, and stir in the whites of 
the eggs well beaten. Pour into molds, and set aside to 
cool. To be eaten cold, with or without cream. 



Tapioca Cream. — Soak half a cupful of tapioca in water- 
over night. Let a quart of milk get steaming hot, and add 
to it the tapioca. Let it boil three minutes, then mix five 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar with the yelks of four eggs ; 
stir them into the milk and tapioca, and let it come to a boil 
again. Beat the whites up stiff; stir them rapidly and 
thoroughly tlirough the boiling tapioca; add two table- 
spoonfuls of wine and a pinch of salt. Let it stand till 
cold and garnish with macaroons. 

Orange Cream. — Put half a box of gelatine to soak for half 
an hour in cold water enough to cover it. Take three half- 
pints of cream, whip half of it, and heat the other half; dis- 
solve the gelatine in the heated cream ; then strain it, and 
return to the boiler again. Take the yelks of five eggs and 
a cupful of sugar ; beat them together till light, and add to 
the boiling cream ; cook about two minutes, stirring con- 
stantly ; take from the fire, and while it cooks, stir in the 
whipped cream and the juice of four oranges, and pour into 
a mold to stiffen. Stir the cream constantly before putting 
into the mold, to prevent it from thickening in lumps. 

Pink Cream. — Three gills of strawberry or currant juice ; 
mix with one-half pound of powdered sugar, one-half pint of 
thick cream ; whisk until well mixed ; serve in a glass dish. 

Chocolate Bavarian Cream. — Whip one pint of cream to a 
stiff froth, laying it on a sieve; boil a pint of rich milk with 
a vanilla bean and two tablespoonfuls of sugar until it is well 
flavored ; then take it off the fire and add half a box of gela- 
tine, soaked for an hour in half a cupful of water in a warm 
place near the range ; when slightly cooled, add two tablets 
of Baker's chocolate, soaked and smoothed. Stir in the eggs 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. Xl\ 

well-beaten. When it has become quite cold and begins to 
thicken, stir it without ceasing a few minutes, until it is very 
smooth ; then stir in the whipped cream lightly until it is 
well mixed. Put it into a mold or molds, and set it on ice 
or in a cool place. ' 

Turret Cream. — Soak one box of gelatine in a cupful of 
milk four hours. Scald three cupfuls of milk; add one cup- 
ful of the sugar ; when this is dissolved, add the soaked 
gelatine. Stir over the fire until almost boiling hot ; strain 
and divide into two equal portions. Return one to the fire 
and heat quickly. When it nears the boiling-point, stir in 
the beaten yelks of three eggs. Let all cook together two 
minutes, and turn out into a bowl to cool. When it has 
cooled, churn one pint of cream very stiff, and beat the 
whites of the eggs until they will stand alone. Divide the 
latter into two heaps. As the yellow gelatine begins to 
" form," whip one-half of the whites into it, a little at a time. 
To the white gelatine add the rest of the whites in the same 
manner, alternately with the whipped cream. Season the 
yellow with vanilla, the white with lemon juice beaten in at 
the last. Wet the inside of a tall, fluted mold with water, 
and arrange in the bottom, close to the outside of the mold, 
a row of crystallized cherries. Then put in a layer of the 
white mixture; on this crystallized apricots or peaches cut 
into strips ; a layer of the yellow, another border of cherries, 
and so on until your mold is full. When firm, which will be 
in a few hours if set on ice, wrap a cloth wrung out in hot 
water about the mold, and invert upon a flat dish. Eat with 
sweet cream, or, if you like, with brandied fruit. Not only 
is this a very palatable dish, but it is also very beautiful, well 
repaying the trouble of its preparation. 

Velvet Cream. — Half an ounce of isinglass dissolved in one 
and a half cupfuls of white wine ; then add the juice and 
grated peel of a lemon, three-quarters of a pound of loaf 



172 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

sugar ; simmer all together until mixed well ; strain and add 
one and a half pints of rich cream, and stir until cool ; pour 
into molds, and let it stand till stiff enough to turn out. 

Calf's Foot Jelly. — Take one pair of calf's feet, and put 
them into a gallon of water ; let it boil half away and skim 
constantly ; strain it when cold ; take the fat from the top 
and bottom; then warm it ; add sugar, the juice of three 
lemons, a pint of Madeira wine, and the whites of seven 
eggs ; boil it half an hour, strain through a flannel bag, and 
cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly. — One box of Coxe's gelatine dissolved in one 
pint of cold water, one pint of wine, one quart of boiling 
water, two cupfuls of granulated sugar, and three lemons. 
Cool in molds. 

Wine Jelly, No. 2. — Soak one package of sparkling gelatine 
in a large cupful of cold water. Add to this all the juice 
and half the rind of a lemon, two cupfuls of white sugar, and 
a halfteaspoonful of bitter almond or two peach leaves, and 
cover for half an hour ; then pour on boiling water, stir, and 
strain. After adding two cupfuls of pale sherry or white 
wine, strain again through a flannel bag. Wet a mold and 
set it in a cold place until the next day. 

Jelly Oranges. — Soak a package of Coxe's gelatine about 
three hours in a cup of cold water. Cut from the top of each 
of a dozen fine oranges a round piece, leaving a hole just 
large enough to admit the bowl of a small spoon or the 
handle of a larger. The smaller the orifice, the better your 
dish will look. Clean, out every bit of the pulp very care- 
fully, so as not to tear the edges of the hole. Scrape the 
inner skin from the sides with your fore-finger, and when the 
oranges are emptied lay them in cold water while you make 
the jelly. Strain the juice of all and grated peel of three of 
the oranges through coarse, thin muslin over three cupfuls 
of sugar, squeezing rather hard to get the coloring matter. 



CREAMS, JELLIES, AND LIGHT DESSERTS. 173 

Stir this until it is a thick sirup, and add a quarter teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon. Pour two cupfuls of boihng water upon the 
soaked gelatine, and stir over the fire until well dissolved ; 
add the juice and sugar, stir all together, and strain through 
a flannel bag into a pitcher, not shaking or squeezing it, lest 
it should become cloudy. Wipe off the outside of the 
oranges, set them close together in a dish, the open ends 
uppermost, and fill very full with the warm jelly, as it will 
shrink in cooling. Set it away in a cold place where there 
is no dust. Next day cut each in half with a sharp knife, 
taking care to sever the skin all around before cutting into 
the jelly. If neatly divided, the rich amber jelly will be a 
fair counterfeit of the orange pulp^. Pile in a glass dish, 
with green leaves around, as you would the real fruit. This 
is a delicious dish, and it is highly ornamental on the table. 

Apple Jelly. — Soak half a package Coxe's gelatine in one 
cupful of cold water. Pare, core, and slice a dozen well- 
flavored pippins, throwing each piece into cold water as it 
is cut to preserve the color. Pack them in a glass or stone- 
ware jar with just cold water enough to cover them ; cover 
the jar loosely that the steam may escape ; set in a pot of 
warm water and bring to a boil. Cook until the apples are 
broken into pieces. Have ready in a bowl the soaked gela- 
tine, two cupfuls of powdered sugar, the juice of two lemons, 
and the grated peel of one. Strain the apple pulp scalding 
hot over them ; stir until the gelatine is dissolved ; strain 
again through a flannel bag, without shaking or squeezing 
it ; wet a mold with cold water, fill it, and set in a cold 
place until firm. This preparation is greatly improved if 
formed in a mold with a cylinder in the centre, the cavity 
being filled and heaped with whipped cream or syllabub. 

Peach JeUy. — Proceed as in apple jelly, using peaches, 
with a few peach-kernels broken up and boiled with the 
fruit. 



174 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

Lemon Jelly. — Stir together two large cupfuls of sugar, the 
juice of six lemons and grated peel of two, and a package of 
well-soaked gelatine. Cover for an hour. Pour three pints 
of boiling water over them ; stir until the gelatine is quite 
melted ; strain through a close flannel bag, and pour into a 
wet mold. 

Orange Jelly. — Soak a package of gelatine in two cupfuls 
of water; add two cupfuls of sugar, the juice of six large 
oranges, and grated peel of one, the juice of two lemons, 
and peel of one, and cover for an hour. Pour three pints 
of boiling water over them ; stir until the gelatine is quite- 
melted ; strain througl\ a flannel bag ; add a little good 
brandy if desired and strain again ; pour into a wet mold. 

Orange Trifle. — Stir half a package of soaked gelatine into 
a cupful of boiling water. Mix the juice of two oranges 
and rind of one with a cupful of powdered sugar, and pour 
the hot liquid over them. Should the gelatine not dissolve 
readily, set all over the fire and stir until clear. Strain, and 
stir in the beaten yelks of three eggs. Heat, quickly within 
a vessel of boiling water, stirring constantly lest the yelks 
curdle. If they do curdle, strain again through coarse flan- 
nel. Set aside until perfectly cold and slightly stiff, then 
whip in a pint of frothed cream. Wet a mold, fill, and set it 
on ice. 

Orange Dessert. — Pare five or six oranges ; cut into thin 
slices ; pour over them a coffeecupful of sugar. Boil one 
pint of milk ; add, while boiling, the yelks of three eggs, 
one tablespoonful of corn-starch (made smooth with a little 
cold milk) ; stir all the time ; as soon as thickened, pour 
over the fruit. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar ; pour over the cus- 
tard, and brown slightly in the oven. Serve cold.

Apple Snow. — Grate half a dozen apples to a pulp ; press 
them through a sieve ; add half a cupful of powdered sugar 
and a teaspoonful of extract of lemon ; take the whites of 
six eggs, whip them for several minutes, and sprinkle two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar over them ; beat the 
apple pulp to a froth, and add the beaten egg; whip the 
mixture until it looks like stiff snow ; then pile it high in 
rough portions on a glass dish ; garnish with small spoonfuls 
of cuf rant jelly. 

Floating Island. — Beat the yelks of six eggs until very 
light ; sweeten and flavor to taste ; stir into a quart of boil- 
ing milk; cook till it thickens; when cool, pour into a low 
glass dish ; whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth ; 
sweeten, and place over 9. dish of boiling water to cook. 
Take a tablespoon and drop on the whites of the cream, far 
enough apart so that the " little white islands " will not 
touch each other. By dropping little specks of bright 
jelly on each island a pleasing effect will be produced. 

Blanc-mange. — ^^Take one quart of milk, one ounce gelatine, 
and sugar to sweeten to taste ; put it on the fire, and keep 
stirring until it is all melted, then pour it into a bowl and 
stir until cold ; season with vanilla; pour it into a mold, 
and set in a cool place to stiffen. 

Tapioca Blanc-mange. — Take one pint of new milk, half a 
pound of D-urkee's farina-tapioca soaked in water four 
hours, three-fourths of a cupful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of 
almond or vanilla extract, a litde salt. Heat the milk, and 
stir the soaked tapioca. When it has dissolved, add the 
sugar. Boil slowly fifteen minutes, stirring all the time ; 
take from the fire, and beat until nearly cold. Flavor and 
pour into a mold dipped in cold water. Sago blanc-mange 
may be made in the same manner.

minutes ; then add the yelks, beaten light, with the sugar ; 
boil two minutes longer, stirring all the while; remove the 
mixture from the fire, and beat in the whipped whites while 
it is boiling hot. Pour into a mold wet with cold water, 
and set in a cold place. Eat with sugar and cream. 

Chocolate Blanc-mange. — Heat a quart of milk ; stir in 
a cupful of sugar and half a package of soaked gelatine;* 
strain through flannel ; add three large spoonfuls of grated 
chocolate ; boil ten minutes, stirring all the time. When 
nearly cold, beat until it begins "to stiffen. Flavor with 
vanilla ; whip up once, and put into a wet mold. It will be 
firm in six or eight hours, 

Neapolitan Blanc-mange. — Dissolve one-third of a box of 
gelatine, and stir into one quart of milk. Add three-fourths 
of a cupful of sugar. As soon as the gelatine is thoroughly 
dissolved, remove from the fire, and divide into three parts. 
Flavor one with vanilla ; color another with the beaten yelk 
of one ^%^\ color the third with grated chocolate. Set 
away, and when quite cold and a little stiff, pour into a 
mold — first the white, then the yellow, and last the brown. 

Peach Meringue. — Put on to boil a scant quart of new milk, 
omitting half a teacupful, with which moisten two table- 
spoonfuls of corn-starch. When the milk boils, add corn- 
starch, stir constantly, and when it commences to thicken, 
remove from the fire ; add one tablespoonful of perfectly 
sweet butter ; let cool ; then beat in the yelks of three eggs 
until the custard seems light and creamy; add one-half tea- 
cupful of fine sugar ; cover the bottom of a well-buttered 
baking-dish with ripe, juicy peaches, that have been pared,

stoned, and halved ; sprinkle two tablespoonfuls of sugar 
over the fruit, pour the custard over gently, and bake in a 
quick oven twenty minutes ; draw it out, and cover with the 
well-beaten whites of the three eggs ; sprinkle a little fine 
sugar over the top, and set in the oven until brown. Eat 
warm with sauce, or cold with crearii. 

Charlotte Russe. — Dissolve half a box of gelatine in cold 
water. Beat the yelks of four eggs with two cupfuls of 
white sugar. Whip one quart of sweet cream very stiff, 
add flavoring, then the yelks and sugar, and blend all the 
ingredients. Add the whites, turn into a bowl lined with 
sponge cake or lady-fingers, and set away to cool. 

Charlotte Russe, No. 2. — Two tablespoonfuls gelatine soaked 
in a little cold milk two hours ; two coffeecupfuls rich cream ; 
one teacupful milk. Whip the cream stiff in a large bowl

Figs a la Genevieve. — Dissolve two ounces of best sugar 
in half a pint of cold water in an enameled stewpan, with 
half the very thin rind of a large lemon ; when this is done, 
put into it half a pound of Turkey figs, and put the stew- 
pan over a moderate fire, so that the figs may stew very 
slowly ; when quite soft, add one glassful of common port 
or any other wine, and the strained juice of half a lemon ; 
serve them cold for dessert. About two hours or two hours 
and a half is the average time for stewing the figs, and the 
flavor may be varied by using orange peel and juice in- 
stead of lemon, and by boiling two or three bitter almonds 
in the sirup. 

Biscuit Glace. — Make a quart of rich boiled custard, flavor 
it with vanilla, and let it cool. Then mix with it a quart of 
grated pineapple or mashed peaches. Stir them well to- 
gether, and add enough sugar to allow for the loss in freez- 
ing. Freeze in the usual way, stirring in a pint of cream, 
whipped, when it is beginning to set in the freezer. Partly 
fill little paper cases with the mixture, and smooth the tops 
nicely. Place them carefully in the cleaned and dried freezer, 
and let them remain embedded in ice for several hours. 
Sometimes the cases are filled with pistachio or chocolate 
ice-cream, in which case blanched almonds are laid over the 
top, when they are served. Or they may be filled with 
frozen whipped cream, and served with a spoonful of some 
bright sherbet upon the top of each. 



XIII.— CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. 

BEST MATERIALS REQUISITE FOR CAKE-MAKING; WHAT THE^ 
SHOULD be; WEIGHING AND MEASURING INGREDIENTS; HOW 
TO MIX cake; FRUITS AND FLAVORS FOR CAKE; HOW TO BAKE 
CAKE ; HOW TO TEST IT ; HOW TO KEEP IT ; HOW TO ICE IT. 
NINETY-SEVEN RECIPES FOR CAKES. 

IN cake-making it is absolutely essential that the best 
materials be employed. Stale eggs, strong butter, musty 
flour, or common sugar are not so much as to be 
thought of in this connection. The idea that such refuse 
" will do for cooking" is most unworthy. When a luxury, 
such as cake, is attempted, the maker should certainly be 
willing to luxuriate in acceptable ingredients. 

Flour for cake should be white and dry. It should always 
be carefully sifted. Sugar should be white, dry, and free 
from lumps. Eggs and butter should be sweet and fresh ; 
the milk rich and pure. Fruit and extracts must be of the 
best. The weighing and measuring of ingredients must be 
accurately done. Guessing at quantities has spoiled many 
a cake. 

For mixing cake, an earthen or wooden dish and a 
wooden spoon are requisite. Butter and sugar should be 
beaten together to a cream before using. Butter may be 
softened for this purpose, if too hard to manage readily, but 
it must not be melted. Whites and yelks of eggs must be 
beaten separately, until there is no stringiness visible, and 
the froth can be taken up on a spoon. Beat eggs in a broad, 
shallow dish, and in a cool place. It is well to lay the eggs 
in cold water for an hour before beating them, as they will 
beat the lighter for such treatment. Sweet milk. is best for 

179 



1 80 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBKAR V. 

solid cake ; sour milk, for light cake. The two should never 
be mixed. 

Baking-powder should be mixed dry through the flour. 
Soda and cream of tartar should be dissolved in milk. 
Flavoring extracts, fruit, and spices must be added the last 
thing, and fruit should always be well sprinkled with flour 
before it is put in the dough. Currants and such fruit 
should be washed, picked over, and dried before using. 
Almonds should be blanched by pouring boiling water over 
them till they pop from their skins. Cake should be beaten 
as little as possible after the flour has been added. When 
it requires long baking, the bottom and sides of the pan 
should be lined with paper well buttered. This will insure 
the easy turning out of the cake when done. 

Much of the success in cake-baking depends on the heat- 
ing of the oven. If the oven is very hot when the cake 
goes in, it will bake on top before it becomes light. If the 
oven is too cool, it will rise and fall again before done. If 
the top of the cake browns to6 fast, cover it with thick 
paper. Try it by inserting a broom-splinter or knitting- 
needle in the thickest part of the cake, and if nothing ad- 
heres when it is drawn out, it is done. Turn out of the tins 
at once, taking care not to expose the cake to draft. 

Cake should be kept in earthen pans or crocks, or tin 
boxes, but never in wooden boxes or drawers. It will keep 
better for being wrapped in a cloth, and more than is needed 
should not be cut. 

Cake that is to be frosted should be baked in pans with 
perpendicular sides. The icing should be put on as soon 
as the cake is removed from the oven. This will insure its 
drying smooth and hard.

Chocolate Kisses. — Beat stiff the whites of two eggs; beat in 
gradually one-half pound of powdered sugar. Scrape fine 
one and a half ounces of chocolate; dredge with flour, mixing 
the flour well ; add this gradually to the eggs and sugar, stir- 
ring the whole very hard. Cover the bottom of a pan with 



198 THE HO USE WIFE S L IBRAR Y. 

white paper, and place on it spots of powdered sugar the 
size of half-dollars. Heap the mixture on these spots, 
smooth with a broad knife, sift with powdered sugar, and 
bake quickly. 

Cocoannt Steeples. — One pound of powdered sugar; one- 
half pound of grated cocoanut; whites of five eggs. Whip 
the eggs as for icing, adding the sugar as you go on until it 
will stand alone, then beat in the cocoanut. Mold the mix- 
ture with your hands into small cones, and set these far 
enough apart not to touch one another upon buttered paper 
in a baking-pan. Bake in a very moderate oven. 

Meringues. — Mix the whites of four eggs, beaten to a stiff 
froth, with one pound of pulverized sugar, and flavored to 
the taste. Beat stiff, bake the same as macaroons, when 
light brown, slip them from the papers, and put the smooth 
sides together, with jelly between. 

Lady-fingers. — One-half pound pulverized sugar and six 
yelks of eggs, well stirred ; add one-fourth pound flour, 
whites of six eggs, well beaten. Bake in lady-finger tins, 
or squeeze through a bag of paper in strips two or three 
inches long. 

Lady-fingers, No. 2. — Rub half a pound of butter into a 
pound of flour ; to this add half a pound of sugar, the juice 
and grated rind of one large lemon, and, lastly, three eggs, 
the whites and yelks beaten separately, and the whites stirred 
in after all the other ingredients are well mixed together. 
This dough, if properly made, will be stiff enough to make 
rolls about the size of a lady's finger ; it will spread when 
in the oven, so that it will be of the right size and shape. 
If you wish them to be especially inviting, dip them in cho- 
colate icing after they are baked, and put two together. 
See that the icing is so hard that it will not run, and set the 
cakes on a platter in a cool room until the icing is firm. 



CAKES AND CAKE-BAKING. 199 

Eclairs a la Creme. — Three-fourths pound flour, one pint 
water, ten Qggs, one-half cupful butter. Put the water on 
the fire in a stewpan with the butter; as soon as it boils 
stir in the sifted flour ; stir well until it leaves the bottom 
and sides of the pan, when taken from the fire ; then add 
the eggs, one at a time. Put the batter in a bag of paper, 
and press out in the shape of fingers on a greased tin. 
When cold, fill with cream, prepared as follows : One and 
one-half pints of milk, two cupfuls sugar, yelks of five eggs, 
one tablespoonful butter, three large tablespoonfuls corn- 
starch, two teaspoonfuls extract vanilla. Frosted with choco- 
late, they are much improved in appearance and flavor. 

Icing for Cakes. — In making icing, use at least a quarter of 
a pound of pulverized sugar to the white of each &gg ; if 
not stifl* enough, add more sugar. Break the whites into a 
broad, cool dish, and throw in a small handful of sugar. 
Begin whipping it in with long, even strokes of the beater, 
adding the sugar gradually. Beat until the icing is smooth 
and firm, then add the flavoring. Spread it on the cake 
with a broad-bladed knife, dipped in cold water. If orna- 
mentation of the icing is desired, it may be done by affixing 
prepared leaves, flowers, etc., which can be had at the con- 
fectioners' stores or at their supply stores. To make letters, 
tracery, etc., for cakes, roll into a funnel shape a piece of 
thick, white paper; fill this with icing in the soft state, 
allowing it to drip out slowly from the small end of the 
paper cone. Apply this carefully, and allow it to harden. 

Orange Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, and the juice of a large orange, treated 
as above. 

Lemon Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of 
pulverized sugar, juice and part of the rind of one lemon. 

Chocolate Icing. — W^hites of two eggs, one-half pound of 



200 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

pulverized sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of grated choco- 
late. 

Almond Icing.— The whites of three eggs, one cupful of 
pounded blanched almonds, three-quarters of a pound of 
pulverized sugar, and a little almond extract. 

Banana Icing. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound of pul- 
verized sugar, and one banana finely crushed through it. 
This cake should be eaten the same day it is made, as the 
banana discolors over night. 

Cocoanut Frosting. — Whites of two eggs, one-half pound 
of pulverized sugar. Spread on the cake, then sprinkle 
thickly with grated cocoanut. This will make a whiter frost- 
ing than results from stirring in the cocoanut. 

Cooked Frosting. — One cupful of granulated sugar, wet 
with a little water. Let it boil without stirring until it be- 
gins to thicken. Beat the whites of two eggs very light. 
Strain the boiled sugar into them slowly, beating all the 
time. Flavor to taste. 



XIV.— FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 

i-ALUE OF FRESH FRUITS ON THE TABLE; ABUNDANCE OF FRUITS; 
NUTRITIVE VALUE OF FRUITS; WHERE TO GATHER AND HOW 
TO STORE FRUITS. TWENTY-TWO RECIPES FOR SERVING FRESH 
FRUITS AND NUTS. 

FRESH fruits are a most deli^'htful accessory to the 
table supply of both rich and poor. They are so great 
in variety, so rich in flavor, so beautiful in appearance, 
so healthful, and of so long continuance in most parts of the 
country, that it behooves every housekeeper to familiarize 
herself with the best methods of using fresh fruits to 
advantage. 

A few years ago each locality depended upon its own 
local crop of fruits. Now the railroads bring early fruits 
from the far South and late fruits from the far North, so 
that at the centres of population the several fruit seasons are 
delightfully prolonged. Nor are we restricted to our own 
country's production. Such are the facilities for rapid and 
safe communication from distant points, that the world lays 
her tribute of fruits, sweet and sound, at the door of the 
enlightened nations. 

Fruits do not take an important place as nutrients. They 
belong rather among the luxuries, and yet, as an agreeable 
stimulant to digestion, they occupy a front rank. In many 
conditions of health, some of the fruits are the only articles 
the invalid can enjoy, and their genial influences contribute 
greatly to the general improvement of a patient's appetite. 

Fruits intended for immediate use should be gathered 
early in the morning, while the coolness of the night dews 

- 201

is Upon them. They should be just ripe, neither overdone 
nor underdone, in nature's great process of preparing them 
for human food. Fruit for storage is best gathered at the 
middle of a dry day. It should be nearfy ripe. If unripe, 
or overripe it will not keep well. A moist atmosphere, but 
not one positively damp, is best for the storing of fruit. An 
ordinary cellar does better than a dry storeroom. Fruit 
keeps better in the dark than in the light. 

All varieties of nuts belong to the albuminous fruits and 
are very nutritious, though the richer nuts are not easy 
of digestion owing to their oily properties.^ 

The supply of peanuts once came wholly from Africa, but 
our Southern States have so successfully cultivated this 
popular nut that we are now independent. The bulk of the 
supply is from Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. 
During a single season the crop of Virginia rose to one 
million one hundred thousand bushels, of Tennessee, five 
hundred and fifty thousand bushels, and of North Carolina, 
one hundred and twenty thousand bushels. 

The Texas pecan is especially in demand. While a few 
years ago several barrels of pecans abundantly supplied the 
demand, carloads and invoices of one or two hundred bar- 
rels are not now uncommon. 

In the Eastern States hickory nuts are sufficiently plenti- 
ful to ship to New York half a dozen carloads a week when 
demanded. 

The chestnut is becoming scarcer every year, but their 
great popularity will probably prevent their total disappear- 
ance, as they are already, being successfully cultivated, and 
it is expected that in a few years the cultivated nut will equal 
in quality the high-priced Italian chestnuts. 

RECIPES. 

Watermelons. — Wipe watermelons clean when they are 
taken from the ice. They should lie on ice for at least four 



FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 203 

hours before they are eaten. Cut off a slice at each end of 
the watermelon, then cut through the centre ; stand on end 
on platter, and slice down, allowing each slice a part of the 
centre, or heart. 

Nutmegs, etc. — Wash nutmegs and muskmelons ; wipe 
dry ; cut in two ; shake out the seeds lightly, and put a 
lump of ice in each half Eat with pepper and salt. A sil- 
ver spoon is a neat and pleasant article with which to eat 
small, ripe melons. 

Pineapples. — Slice on a slaw-cutter, or very thin with a 
knife ; mix with finely powdered sugar. Set on ice till ready 
to serve. 

Oranges are nice served whole, the skins quartered and 
turned down. Form in a pyramid with bananas and white 
grapes. 

Orange and Cocoanut. — A layer of oranges sliced, then 
sugar, then a layer of cocoanut, grated ; then another of 
oranges, and so on until the dish is full. This is by many 
known as Ambrosia. 

Sliced Peaches. — Peel and slice ripe peaches. Lay them in 
a dish with plenty of sugar for an hour or two, till tea time. 
Eat with cream. 

Stewed Peaches. — Make a sirup of sugar and water ; halve 
the peaches, leaving the stone in one half, and drop into 
sirup. Allow the whole to simmer slowly until fruit is ten- 
der; then remove fruit, and let sirup boil till thick; then pour 
over fruit and serve at once. 

Frosted Peaches. — Put half a cupful of water and the 
beaten whites of three eggs together ; dip in each peach, 
using fine, large freestones, after you have rubbed off 
the fur with a clean cloth ; and then roll in powdered sugar. 
Set them on the stem end, upon a sheet of white paper, in 
a sunny window. When half dry, roll again in the sugar. 



204 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Expose to the sun and breeze until perfectly dry. Until 
ready to arrange them in the glass dish for table, keep in 
a cool, dry place. Decorate with green leaves. 

Fried Peaclies. — Cut the peaches in two, and remove the 
stones. Dust a little flour on the side from which the stone 
is taken, and fry, only on that side, in a little butter. When 
done, add sugar and a little butter. 

Baked Apples. — Pare and core good, sound, tart apples. 
Fill them with sugar, butter, and a flavor of spice. Put a 
little water in the pan, and bake until the apples are 
thoroughly tender. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice nice, juicy apples that 
are not very sweet ; put them in a stewpan with a little 
grated lemon peel, and water enough to keep them from 
burning. Stew till soft and tender ; mash to a paste, and 
sweeten well with brown sugar, adding a little butter and 
nutmeg. 

Apples with Lemon. — Make a sirup of sugar and water. 
Slice a lemon into it, and let boil until clear. Pare and core 
sound, tart apples, cut into quarters, and lay them carefully 
into the sirup ; let them cook gently until a straw can be 
run through them, taking care not to break them. Lay the 
pieces of apple in a glass dish, boil down the sirup, and 
when slightly cool, pour over the apples. 

Apple Float. — Pare, slice, and stew six large apples in as 
much water as will cover them ; when well done, press them 
through a sieve and sweeten highly with crushed sugar; 
^ while cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff froth, 
and stir into the apples ; flavor with lemon or vanilla ; serve 
with plenty of sweet cream. 

Transparent Apple. — Boil tart, ripe, and juicy apples in a 
little water; then strain through a fine cloth, and add a 
pound of white sugar to a pint of juice. Boil till it jellies. 



FRESH FRUITS AND NUTS. 205 

and then put into molds. It is very nice served with blanc- 
mange in saucers. 

Baked Pears. — Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears, 
with their skins on, then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so 
on until the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it 
will hold. Bake three hours. 

Quinces. — Bake ripe quinces thoroughly ; when cold, strip 
off the skins, place the quinces in a glass dish, and sprinkle 
them with white sugar ; serve with rich cream. 

Bananas and Cream. — Peel, slice, and heap up in a glass 
dessert-dish, and serve raw, with fine sugar and cream. 

Fried Bananas. — Cut the bananas into slices, and fry in a 
little butter. This makes a very rich dish. 

Stewed Rhubarb. — Carefully remove the outer stringy 
skin ; then cut in pieces an inch long, and simmer gently till 
tender in water and sugar, and the rind and juice of a lemon. 
When done add a bit of butter and nutmeg. 

Crystallized Fruit. — Pick out the finest of any kind of fruit ; 
leave in the stones ; beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth ; lay the fruit in the beaten ^g^, with the stems 
upward ; drain them, and beat the part that drips off again ; 
select them out, one by one, and dip them into finely pow- 
dered sugar ; cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place 
the fruit on it, and set it in a cool place ; when the icing on 
the fruit becomes firm, pile them on a dish, and set them in 
a cold place. 

Candied Fruits. — Make a very rich sirup with one pound 
of granulated sugar to a gill of water. Heat over boiling* 
water till the sugar is dissolved. Pare and halve fine, ripe, 
but solid peaches. Put a single layer of them in the sirup, 
in a shallow vessel ; cook slowly until clear ; drain from the 
sirup, and put to dry in a moderately heated oven. When 
fairly dry they may be eaten at once; or, after drying 



200 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

twenty-four hours, they may be packed for future use. 
Plums, cherries, and pears may be candied in the same 
manner. 

Nuts. — Almonds are inseparably joined with raisins in 
table service ; so for evening uses, hickory nuts, and apples 
form a pleasant combination. All the harder-shelled nuts 
should be well cracked before they are served. With the 
softer-shelled, nut crackers should be furnished. Nut picks 
should always be at hand. 

Sweet almonds, which are used for dessert, are of several 
varieties. Those known as the Syrian, or Jordan almonds, 
are regarded as the best. Those with hard shells are gen- 
erally richer in flavor than those with the soft. Certainly 
the harder shell offers the more effective protection. The 
skin of almonds is not easily digested. For use in cooking 
they should be blanched, but for table use this is not desir- 
able. Walnuts keep well and improve with age. Of the 
hickory-nut family, the shell-bark is considered best. These, 
too, are the better for age. 



XV.— JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 

FRUIT FOR JELLIE;S, JAMS, AND PRESERVES; HOW PREPARED; 

proper sugar to use ; quantity of sugar needed ; suitable 
preserving-kettles; what not to use; the fire; cans 
AND jars; where STORED ; molding the jelly; the jelly- 
bag ; straining jelly ; covering jelly, forty-four recipes 

FOR jellies, jams, AND PRESERVES. 

To insure success in preserving fruits, the first thing to 
be looked after is the fruit itself This should be fully 
ripe, fresh, sound, and scrupulously clean and dry. It 
should be gathered in the morning of a sunny day, as it will 
then possess its finest flavor. Care should be taken to re- 
move all bruised or decayed parts. Allowing them to re- 
main will darken the sirup, and consequently impair the 
beauty of the preserves. Fruit requiring to be pared should 
be laid in water to presei-ye the color after the paring. The 
best sugar is the cheapest ; indeed, there is no economy in 
stinting the sugar, either as to quality or proper quantity, 
for inferior sugar is wasted in scum, and the preserves will 
not keep unless a sufficient proportion of sugar is boiled 
with the fruit. At the same time, too large a proportion of 
sugar will destroy the natural flavor of the fruit, and in all 
probability make fruit candy, instead of the result sought. 

The usual proportion in making preserves, is a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. There are a few fruits which 
require more sugar. In making the sirup, use a small cup- 
ful of water to a pound of fruit. The sirup should always 
be boiled and strained before putting the fruit in. 

Fruit should be cooked in brass kettles, or those of bell- 
metal. Modern kettles, lined with porcelain, are much used 

207 



208 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR V. 

for this purpose. The kettle should be broad and shallow, 
so that there will be no necessity for heaping the fruit. 
Never use tin, iron, or pewter spoons, or skimmers, for pre- 
serves, as they will convert the color of red fruit into a 
dingy purple, and impart, besides, a very unpleasant flavor. 

Great care should be taken not to place the kettle flat 
upon the fire, as this will be likely to burn at the bottom. 

Glass jars are much the best for preserves, as the condi- 
tion of the fruit can be observed more readily. Whatever 
jars are used, however, the contents should be examined 
every three weeks for the first two months, and if there are 
any signs of either mold or fermentation it should be boiled 
over again. Preserves should be stored in a cool, dry place, 
but not in one into which fresh air never enters. Damp has 
a tendency to make the fruit mold, and heat to make it 
ferment. 

A jelly-bag should be in every kitchen. It should be 
made of flannel, pointed at the bottom, so that the jelly will 
run out chiefly at one point. It is a good plan to sew a 
strong loop to the top of the bag, so that it may be hung 
upon a nail near the fire, that the juice of the fruit may run 
through gradually into a vessel below. The bag should not 
be squeezed with the hands, if you wish a very clear jelly. 
After the clear juice has been obtained, the remainder may 
be pressed, to make a very excellent, but inferior article of 
jelly or marmalade. 

Rinse the tumblers or bowls to be used in cold water 
just before filling with jelly or marmalade. When the jelly 
is cold, fit a circle of tissue-paper, dip it in brandy, and 
place it directly on the surface of the fruit. This simple 
precaution will save the housekeeper much annoyance by 
protecting the conserve from mold. Should the fungus form 
inside the upper cover of the glass, the inner will effectually 
shield the contents. Paste thick paper over the top of the 
glass to exclude the air.

RECIPES. 

Currant Jelly. — Never gather currants or other soft or 
small seed fruit immediately after a rain for preserving pur- 
poses, as they are greatly impoverished by the moisture 
absorbed. In this climate, the first week in July is usually 
considered the time to make currant jelly. Weigh the cur- 
rants without removing the stems ; do not wash them, but 
remove, leaves and whatever may adhere to them ; to each 
pound of fruit allow half the weight of granulated or pure 
loaf sugar ; put a few currants into a porcelain-lined kettle, 
and press them with a potato-masher, or anything conven- 
ient, in order to secure sufficient liquid to prevent burning ; 
then add the remainder of the fruit and boil freely for twenty 
minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent burning ; take out 
and strain through a jelly-bag, putting the liquid into earthen 
or wooden vessels. When strained, return the liquid to the 
kettle, without the trouble of measuring, and let it boil 
thoroughly for a moment or so ; then add the sugar ; the 
moment the sugar is entirely dissolved, the jelly is done, 
and must be dished, or placed in glasses ; it will jelly upon 
the side of the cup as it is taken up, leaving no doubt as to 
the result. 

Currant Jelly, No. 2. — Take three quarts of fine, ripe, red 
currants, and four of white ; put them into a jar, tie paper 
over the top, and put them into a cool oven for three or four 
hours, or else into a pan of boiling water, or set them on 
the side of the range ; when they are thoroughly heated, 
strain through a jelly-bag. To every pint of juice, add one 
pound of granulated sugar, and boil from five to fifteen 
minutes ; turn while hot into wet tumblers. 

Currant JeUy without Cooking. — Press the juice from the 
currants and strain it ; to every pint put a pound of fine white 
sugar ; mix them together until the sugar is dissolved ; then 
14 



210 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

put it in jars ; seal them and expose them to a hot sun for 
two or three days. 

Black CiUTant Jelly. — Boil the currants till the juice flows, 
then strain through a jelly-bag, and set it over the fire for 
twenty minutes, after which add half a pound of sugar to a 
pound of juice, and boil for about ten minutes. 

White Currant Jelly. — Strip the fruit off the stems, and 
pound it in a clean wooden bowl. Drip the juice gently 
through a jelly-bag. Prepare a very pure, clear sirup of the 
best white sugar; allow a pint of juice to a pound of sugar; 
boil it ten minutes only. Put it in glass preserve-tumblers, 
cover with paper to fit exactly, and keep it dry and cool. 

Apple Jelly. — Take twenty large, juicy apples; pare and 
chop ; put into a jar with the rind of four large lemons, 
pared thin and cut in bits ; cover the jar closely, and set in 
a pot of boiling water ; keep water boiling all around it until 
the apples are dissolved ; strain through a jelly-bag, and 
mix with the liquid the juice of four lemons ; to one pint of 
mixed juice use one pound of sugar; put in kettle, and when 
the sugar is melted set it on the fire, and boil and skim 
about twenty minutes, or until it is a thick, fine jelly. 

Apple JeUy, No. 2. — Peel and core sour apples ; boil them 
in a very little water, and strain them through a jelly-bag. 
Measure, and allow a pound of granulated sugar to a pint 
of juice. Mix the sugar and juice well together, and let it 
boil from five to ten minutes. Put it warm into glasses ; 
cut some white paper to fit the top, dip it in brandy, and lay 
on when the jelly is cool ; paste or tie thick paper over the 
glasses, and when cold put away in a dark, dry place. 

Crab-apple Jelly. — Wash and quarter Siberian crab-apples. 
Cover with cold water and let cook until thoroughly tender. 
Strain through a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice add 
one pound of sugar. Let cook until it will jelly A slight 
flavoring of essence of cinnamon is an improvement. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND' PRESERVES. 211 

Quince Jelly. — Take very ripe quinces ; peel and core, and 
boil in a little water till very soft; drain off the juice 
through a coarse towel, add an equal measure of sugar, and 
boil twenty minutes. 

Grape Jelly. — Mash the grapes thoroughly and strain 
out the juice. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil 
twenty minutes. , ^ 

Barberry Jelly. — Pick the berries from the stalks, mash 
them, and boil fifteen minutes. Squeeze through a jelly- 
bag; allow a pound of white sugar to a pound of juice; 
melt the sugar in the juice, and boil half an hour. 

Raspberry JeUy. — Crush the raspberries and strain through 
a wet cloth. Add an equal measure of sugar, and boil from 
ten to twenty minutes. 

Apple Marmalade. — Pare, core, and slice two or three dozen 
tart, juicy apples; three-quarters of a pound of sugar to 
every pint of juice. Stew until tender in just enough cold 
water to cover them. Drain off the juice through a colan- 
der, and put into a preserving-kettle, stirring into it three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar for every pint of the liquid. 
Boil until it begins to jelly ; strain the juice of two lemons 
into it; put in the apples, and stew pretty fast, stirring 
almost constantly, until it becomes thick and smooth. If 
the apples are not entirely soft, rub them through the col- 
ander before adding them to the boiling sirup. 

Quince Marmalade. — Take very ripe quinces ; wash, pare 
and core them ; to each pound of fruit allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the parings and cores together, with water 
enough to cover them, till quite soft ; strain the liquid into 
the preserving-kettle with the fruit and sugar. Boil the 
whole over a slow fire, stirring frequently until the mass be- 
comes thick. 

Pear and Quince Marmalade. — Pare and core two dozen 
juicy pears and ten fine, ripe quinces. Add three-quarters 



212 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE V. 

of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit and the juice of 
three lemons. Throw them into cold water, and stew the 
parings and cores in a little water to make the sirup. When 
they have boiled to pieces, strain off the liquid ; when cold, 
put in the sliced fruit and bring to a fast boil. When the 
mass is thick and smooth, cook steadily for an hour or more, 
working with a wooden spoon to a rich jelly. 

Pineapple Marmalade. — ^Take ripe, juicy pineapples; pare, 
cut out the specks very carefully, and grate on a coarse 
grater all but the core. Weigh, and allow a pound of sugar 
to a pound of fruit. Cook from twenty minutes to half an 
hour. 

Orange Marmalade. — Take eighteen sweet, ripe oranges, six 
pounds best white sugar. Grate the peel from four of these 
and reserve it for the marmalade. The rinds of the others 
will not be needed. Pare the fruit carefully, removing the 
inner white skin as well as the yellow. Slice the orange ; 
remove the seeds ; put the fruit and grated peel in a porce- 
lain kettle, and boil steadily until the pulp is reduced to a 
smooth mass. Take from the fire, and put through a col- 
ander. Stir in six pounds of the best white sugar ; return 
to the fire, and boil fast, stirring constantly half an hour or 
until thick. 

Grape Marmalade. — Put green grapes into a preserving-pan 
with sufficient water to cover them. Put them on the fire, 
and boil until reduced to a mash ; put the pulp through a 
sieve which will strain out the seeds; to each pound of pulp 
add two pounds of the best loaf sugar, and boil to the con- 
sistence of a jelly. 

Peach Marmalade. — Select peaches which are quite ripe ; 
pare and cut them in small pieces ; to every pound of fruit 
add one pound of sugar ; put the fruit and sugar into a pre- 
serving-kettle, and mash well together ; place it over the fire, 
and when it begins to boil, stir until it becomes quite thick. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 213 

Cherry Jam. — First stone and then weigh some freshly 
gathered preserving cherries ; boil them over a brisk fire 
for an hour, keeping them almost constantly stirred from the 
bottom of the pan, to which they will otherwise be liable to 
stick and burn. Add for each pound of the fruit half a 
pound of good sugar roughly powdered, and boil quickly 
for twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. 

Blackberry Jam. — To four bowls of blackberries add four 
bowls of sugar ; boil until it jellies. 

Raspberry Jam. — Mash the raspberries, and allow a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit. Boil twenty minutes. A few 
currants added to raspberry jam is considered by many a 
great improvement. 

Barberry Jam. — The barberries should be quite ripe, though 
they should not be allowed to hang until they begin to 
decay. Strip them from the stalks, throw aside such as are 
spotted, and for each pound of fruit allow eighteen ounces of 
well-refined sugar ; boil this, with one pint of water to every 
four pounds, until it becomes white and falls in thick 
masses from the spoon ; then throw in the fruit, and keep it 
stirred over a brisk fire for six minutes only ; take off the 
scum, and pour it into jars or glasses. 

Strawberry Jam. — Use fine, scarlet berries ; weigh and boil 
them for thirty-five minutes, keeping them constantly 
stirred ; add eight ounces of good sugar to the pound of 
fruit ; mix them well off the fire, then boil again quickly for 
twenty-five minutes. One pound of white currant juice 
added at the outset to four of the strawberries will greatly 
improve this preserve. 

White Currant Jam. — Boil together quickly for seven min- 
utes equal quantities of fine white currants, picked very care- 
fully, and of the best white sugar pounded and passed 
through a sieve. Stir the preserve gently the whole time, 



214 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

and skim it thoroughly. Just before it is taken from the 

fire, throw in the strained juice of one good lemon to four 
pounds of the fruit. 

Damson Jam. — The fruit for this jam should be freshly 
gathered and quite ripe. Split, stone, weigh, and boil it 
quickly for forty minutes ; then stir in half its weight of 
good sugar roughly powdered, and when it is dissolved, 
give the preserve fifteen minutes additional boiling, keeping 
it stirred and thoroughly skimmed. 

Green Gage Jam. — Rub ripe green gages through asieve; put 
all the pulp into a pan with an equal weight of loaf sugar 
pounded and sifted. Boil the whole until sufficiently thick, 
and put into glasses. 

Preserved Peaches. — Weigh the peaches, and allow three- 
quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Throw 
about half the sugar over the fruit, and let it stand over 
night. In the morning drain the sirup off the fruit, add the 
rest of the sugar, and let that come to a boil. Put the 
peaches in, and let them boil until you can stick a straw 
through them. In cooking the peaches, put a few at a time 
only in the sirup to cook. 

Preserved Peaches, No. 2. — Weigh the fruit after it is pared 
and the stones extracted and allow a pound of sugar to every 
pound of peaches. Put the sugar in a preserving-kettle, and 
make the sirup; let it just boil ; lay the peaches in, and let 
them boil steadily until they are tender and clear. Take 
them out with a perforated skimmer and lay upon flat 
dishes, crowding as little as possible. Boil the sirup almost 
to a jelly, until it is clear and thick, skimming off all the 
scum. Fill the jars two-thirds full of the peaches, pour on 
the boiling sirup, and, when cold, cover with brandied 
tissue-paper, then with thick paper tied tightly over them. 
Or put them in air-tight jars. 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 215 

Preserved Quinces. — Use a pound of sugar to each pound 
of quince after paring, coring, and quartering ; take half of 
the sugar and make a thin sirup ; stew in this a few of the 
quinces at a time till all are finished. Make a rich sirup of 
the remaining sugar, and pour over them. 

Pineapple Preserves. — Use pineapples as ripe as can be had. 
Pare and cut them into thin slices, weigh them, and allow 
one pound of the best granulated sugar to each pound of 
fruit. Take a deep china bowl or dish, and in it put a layer 
of fruit and sugar alternately, a coating of sugar on the top ; 
let it stand all night. In the morning, take out the fruit and 
put the sirup into a preserving-kettle. Boil and skim it until 
it is perfectly clear ; then, while it is boiling hot, pour it 
over the fruit, and let it stand uncovered until it becomes 
entirely cold. If it stands covered, the steam will fall into 
the sirup and thin it. 

Preserved Pears. — Preserved pears are put up precisely as 
are peaches, but are only pared, n,ot cored or divided. I^eave 
the stems on. 

Watermelon Rind Preserves. — Select rind which is firm, 
green, and thick ; cut in any fanciful shape, such as leaves, 
stars, diamonds, etc. Then weigh, and to each pound of 
rind allow one and a half pounds of loaf sugar. To green 
them, take a brass or copper kettle, and to a layer of grape- 
vine leaves, which should be well washed, add a layer of 
the rind, and so on until the last, which should be a thick 
layer of the leaves, and well covered with a coarse linen 
cloth. To each pound of the rind, add a piece of alum the 
size of a pea ; then fill up with warm water sufficient to 
cover the whole, and let it stand upon the stove, where it 
will steam, but not boil, until the greening is completed, 
which will be in two or three hours. When green, lay them 
in clear, cold water, and make your sirup. To each pound 
of sugar add one and a half pints of water ; clarify, put in 



2 1 6 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

your rind ; slice lemons, two to each pound of rind, and 
when about half done add the lemons. Boil until the rind 
is perfectly transparent. A few pieces of ginger-root may 
be added, which will impart a high flavor, and will blend 
very delightfully with the lemons. 

Preserved Citron. — Proceed the same as above, substituting 
citron for the watermelon rind. 

Preserved Strawberries. — Procure fresh, large strawberries 
when in their prime, but not so ripe as to be very soft ; hull 
and weigh them ; take an equal weight of sugar, make a 
sirup, and when boiling hot, put in the berries. A small 
quantity only should be done at once. If crowded, they 
will become mashed. Let them boil about twenty minutes, 
or a half an hour ; turn into tumblers or small jars, and seal 
with egg papers while hot. 

Preserved Cherries. — Wash, stem, and stone the cherries ; 
save every drop of the juice, and use it in place of water in 
making the sirup. Make a sirup, allowing a pound of sugar 
to every pound of fruit ; add the fruit, and let it simmer 
gently for half an hour, skimming as is necessary. 

Damson Preserves. — To four pounds of damsons use three 
pounds of sugar ; prick each damson with a needle ; dis- 
solve the sugar with one-half pint of water, and put it on 
the fire ; when it simmers, put in as many damsons as will 
lie on the top ; when they open, take them out and lay them 
on a dish, and put others in, and so on until all have been 
in ; then put them all in the kettle together and let them 
stew until done ; put them in jars and seal them. 

Green Gage Preserves. — When the fruit is ripe, wipe them 
clean, and to one pound of fruit put one-quarter pound of 
sugar, which will make a fine sirup ; boil the fruit in this 
sirup until it is perfectly done ; then use a fresh sirup of one 
pound of fruit to one pound of sugar; moistening the sugar 



JELLIES, JAMS, AND PRESERVES. 217 

with water. When the sirup boils put in the fruit, and leave 
for fifteen minutes ; then put the fruit in jars ; boil the sirup 
until thick ; when cooled to milkwarm, pour it over the 
fruit; tie the jars tightly and keep in a warm place. 

Strawberries in Wine. — Put a quantity of the finest large 
strawberries in a bottle, strew in a few spoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and fill the bottle up with Madeira or Sherry 
wine. 

Grapes in Brandy. — Take some close bunches of grapes, 
white or black, not overripe, and lay them in a jar. Put a 
good quantity of pounded white candy upon them, and fill 
up the jar with brandy. Tie them close dov/n, and keep in 
a dry place. Prick each grape with a needle three times. 

Brandy Peaches. — Take large, juicy freestone peaches, not 
so ripe as to burst or mash on being handled. Rub the 
down from them with a clean thick flannel. Prick every 
peach down to the stone with a large silver fork, and score 
them all along the seam or cleft. To each pound of peaches 
allow a pound of granulated sugar and half a pint of water 
mixed with half a white of &^^, slightly beaten. Put the 
sugar into a porcelain kettle and pour the water upon it. 
When it is quite melted, give it a stirring, set it over the 
fire, and boil and skim it till no more scum rises. Then 
put in the peaches, and let them cook (uncovered) in the 
sirup till a straw will penetrate them. Then take the kettle 
off the fire, and take out the fruit with a wooden spoon, 
draining it over the kettle. Let the sirup remain in the ket- 
tle a little longer. Mix a pint of the very best white brandy 
for each pound of peaches, with the sirup, and boil them 
together ten minutes or more. Transfer the peaches to 
large glass jars, making each about two-thirds full, and 
pour the brandy and sirup over them, filling the jars full. 
When cool, cover closely. 

Spiced Peaches. — Seven pounds of fruit, one pint vinegar, 



218 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

three pounds sugar, two ounces cinnamon, one-half ounce 
cloves. Scald together the sugar, vinegar, and spices ; pour 
over the fruit. Let it stand twenty-four hours ; drain off, 
scald again, and pour over fruit, letting it stand another 
twenty-four hours. Boil all together until the fruit is tender. 
Skim it out, and boil the liquor until thickened. Pour over 
the fruit and set away in a jar. 

Apple Butter. — Boil down a kettleful of cider to two- 
thirds the original quantity. Pare, core, and slice juicy 
apples, and put as many into the cider as it will cover. Boil 
slowly, stirring often with a flat stick, and when the apples 
are tender to breaking, take them out with a perforated 
skimmer, draining well against the sides of the kettle. Put 
in a second supply of apples and stew them soft, as many 
as the cider will hold. Take from the fire, pour all together 
into a tub or large crock ; cover and let it stand twelve 
hours. Then return to the kettle and boil down, stirring all 
the while until it is the consistency of thick custard and 
brown in color. Spice well with Durkee's ground mixed 
spices. 

Peach Butter. — To one bushel of peaches allow from eight 
to ten pounds of granulated sugar; pare and halve the 
peaches, put into the kettle; and stir constantly, to prevent 
sticking to the kettle, until perfectly smooth and rather 
thick ; a part of the peach-stones thrown in and cooked 
with the peaches give it a nice flavor, and they can be after- 
ward skimmed out ; add the sugar a short time before tak- 
ing from the fire; put in jars and cover tight; peaches for 
butter should be neither too mealy nor too juicy. 



XVI.— CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 

widespread use of canned goods; philosophy of canning 
fruits; how to fill the jars ; what jars are best; selec- 
tion OF THE FRUIT ; WHERE TO STORE THE CANS ; NEED OF 
WATCHING THE CANS. TWELVE RECIPES OF CANNING FRUIT 
AND VEGETABLES. 

CANNED fruits and vegetables of all kinds may now be 
found abundantly in the stores. Their prices are so 
low that they present a strong inducement to the 
housekeeper to omit the labor incident to home canning, and 
simply to purchase what is needed. 

What is aimed at in all these processes is the entire ex- 
clusion of air from the fruit. Its expulsion from them is 
effected by using heat enough to cook them, after which the 
hermetical sealing does the remaining service. Solder, wax, 
and rubber bands do this sealing work. 

If it is desired to preserve the fruit whole, it may be put 
into the jars before heating. Fill the jars with water, and 
set them into a wash-boiler of cold water, the water reach- 
ing three-fourths of the way to the tops of the jars. Do not 
set them directly on the bottom, but on a little hay, lest the 
heat cause them to crack. Bring the water slowly to a boil, 
and let it boil about five minutes. The cans may then be 
taken out, stirred lightly, or shaken, to expel any remaining 
air bubbles ; then fill to the brim with boiling water and 
close the jars. No air bubbles should remain in the can. 
If the fruit can be cooked before canning, the process is 
much simpler, as the boiling material itself expels the air. 
The cans in this case need simply to be filled and then 
sealed. 

219 



220 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY, 

While filling jars, be careful that no current of cold air 
strike them, as this would suffice to cracic a glass jar. When 
a jar has cracked, it is hardly safe to use its contents, as 
fragments of glass may be contained in the fruit, which 
would be fatal if swallowed. 

Cans should be of glass or stoneware, as the acids of 
fruit act chemically on tin or other metals, often destroying 
the flavor of the fruit, and sometimes rendering it absolutely 
unwholesome. Do not use a metal spoon even. Either self- 
sealing cans, or those which require wax, may be used suc- 
cessfully, but probably the former are best for those of little 
experience, and they are unquestionably more convenient 
There are several varieties of self-sealing cans, all of them 
highly recommended, and doubtless all of them sufficiently 
good. The " Valve Jar," the " Mason," and the " Hero " 
are among the best known and most reliable. 

Fruit should be selected with the greatest care. Some 
varieties cannot be preserved at all, unless canned when per- 
fectly fresh, and success is more certain with all kinds in 
proportion to freshness and soundness. The fruit should be 
nearly or quite ripe, but not over-ripe, and all which bears 
signs of decay should be rejected. 

In canning, as in preserving, granulated sugar should 
always be used, and also a porcelain-lined kettle. Peaches, 
pears, or other large fruit may, by the aid of a fork, be 
tastily arranged in the jars, piece by piece. The boiling 
juice may be added afterward to cover them. Thus ar- 
ranged they appear prettier in the jars, though, of course, 
the flavor is not improved. 

All canning work should be done expeditiously, and the 
cans be set away to cool. They should be kept in a cool, 
dark place and closely watched for a few days, to see that 
the sealing is perfect. If the fruit shows signs of not being 
perfectly sealed, it should be at once taken out, scalded, and 
sealed again. 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 221 

RECIPES. 

Canned Strawberries. — Fill glass jars with fresh strawberries 
sprinkled with sugar, allowing a little over one-quarter of a 
pound of sugar to each pound of berries ; set the jars in a 
boiler, with a little hay laid in the bottom to prevent the 
jars from breaking; fill with cold water to within an inch or 
two of the tops of the jars ; let them ^<?// fifteen minutes, then 
move back to the boiler, wrap the hand in a towel, and take 
out the jars ; fill the jars to the top before sealing, using one 
or more of the filled jars for that purpose if necessary. 

Canned Gooseberries. — Fill very clean, dry, wide-necked 
bottles with gooseberries gathered the same day and before 
they have attained their full growth. Cork them tightly, 
wrap a little hay round each of them, and set them up to 
their necks in a kettle of cold water, which should be 
brought very gradually to boil. Let the fruit be gently 
simmered until it appears shrunken and perfectly scalded ; 
then take out the bottles, and with the contents of one or 
two fill up the remainder. Use great care not to break the 
fruit in doing this. When all are ready, pour scalding 
water into the bottles and cover the gooseberries entirely 
with it, or they will become moldy at the top. Cork the 
bottles well immediately, and cover the necks with melted 
resin ; keep them in a cool place ; and when they are used 
pour off the greater part of the water and add sugar as for 
the fresh fruit. 

Canned Peaches. — Peel and quarter choice peaches. To 
peel, place them in a wire basket, dip into boiling water a 
moment and then into cold water, and strip off the skins. 
Have a porcelain-kettle with boiling water and another with 
sirup made with granulated sugar; drop the peaches into 
boiling water (some previously boil the pits in the water for 
their flavor) and let them cook until tender; then lift them 
out carefully into a can, pouring over them all the sirup the 



222 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

can will hold, and seal immediately. Cook only peaches 
enough to fill one can at a time. 

Canned Peaches, No. 2. — Pare and stone peaches enough for 
two jars at a time. If many are pared, they will become dark 
colored by standing. Rinse in cold water ; then cook in a 
rich sirup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty minutes, 
or until they are clear. Put into jars all that are not broken; 
fill up with the hot sirup, about as thick as ordinary mo- 
lasses, and seal. The same sirup will do to cook several jars. 
After the sirup becomes dark, it, with the broken peaches, 
can be used for marmalade or peach butter. The same 
method can be used for pears, plums, and all light fruits. 

Canned Pineapple. — Use three-fourths of a pound of sugar 
to one pound of fruit. Pick the pineapple to pieces with a 
silver fork. Scald and can while hot. 

Canned Grapes. — Squeeze the pulp from the skin ; boil the 
pulp until the seeds begin to loosen, having the skins boiling 
hard and separately in a little water. When the pulp seems 
tender, put it through the sieve ; then add the skins, if ten- 
der, with the water they boil in, if not too much. Use a 
large coffeecupful of sugar for a quart can ; boil until thick, 
and can in the usual way. 

Canned Plums. — Prick each plum with a needle to prevent 
bursting ; prepare a sirup, allowing a gill of pure water and 
a quarter of a pound of sugar to every three quarts of fruit. 
When the sugar is dissolved and the water blood-warm, put 
in the plums. Heat slowly to a boil. Let them boil five 
minutes — not fast or they will break badly — fill up the jars 
with plums, pour in the scalding sirup until it runs dow^n 
the sides, and seal. Green gages are very fine put up in this 
way, also damsons for pies. 

Canned Pears. — Select finely flavored fruit ; either halve and 
core them or core whole ; make a sirup of sugar and water, 



CANNED FRUITS, ETC. 223 

using as little water as will dissolve the sugar. Add a 
quarter of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Place the 
fruit in the kettle carefully, and let it come to a boil or until 
the fruit is well scalded. Turn into the jars hot, and seal at 
once. 

CaJmed Tomatoes.— Pour boiling water over the tomatoes 
to loosen the skins. Remove these ; drain off all the juice 
that will come away without pressing hard ; put them into a 
kettle and heat slowly to a boil. The tomatoes will look 
much nicer if all the hard parts be removed before putting 
them on the fire. Rub the pulp soft with your hands. Boil 
half an hour ; dip out the surplus liquid, pour the tomatoes, 
boiling hot, into the cans, and seal. Keep in a cool, dark 
place. 

Canned Beans.— Remove the strings at the sides, and cut 
into pieces about an inch long ; put them into boiling water 
and scald, then can them. 

Canned Asparagus.- Cut away all the hard part of the stem 
and boil the top portion until nearly done, just as if about 
to serve at once. Flat cans are best, into which the stems 
can be laid regularly, the water in which they were boiled 
being poured over them boiling hot, and the can sealed. If 
jars or high cans are used, pack the asparagus into them 
until they are full. Fill the cans with water ; set them on 
hay in a boiler of cold water reaching to within an inch of 
their tops ; then bring to a boil and nearly finish cookmg 
the stems. Wrap the hand in a towel ; take out the cans 
and seal or solder them as in other vegetables. 

Canned Corn.— Boil sweet corn till nearly done ; cut close 
from the cobs and fill the jars ; pour on water in which the 
corn was boiled ; place in a boiler and just bring to a boil, 
as above ; then take out and seal. 



XVII.— PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES MORE POPULAR THAN WHOLESOME ; GREENING PICKLES ; 

^ WHAT KETTLES AND JARS SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PICKLING ; 

CHOOSING THE FRUIT, SPICES, ETC. ; HOW TO KEEP PICKLES ; 

CATSUPS, HOW MADE, ETC. THIRTY-THREE RECIPES FOR PICKLES 

AND CATSUPS. 

PICKLES are very popular as a relish, but it must be 
confessed that they are not the most wholesome diet 
This is due chiefly to the fact that they are made ot 
hard, crude, and often of unripe fruit. Then, too, the ex- 
cess of acid and the high seasoning disagree with many 
constitutions. 

It is deemed important that pickles for the market be 
well greened. To accomplish this end, copperas and other 
chemicals are employed or copper kettles are used. All 
this is poisonous, and should be shunned. No metal ket- 
tles or spoons should be tolerated in pickling. Glazed jars 
are not desirable either, as salt and vinegar decompose the 
glazing and set free the lead which it contains. An ordinary 
stone jar is the vessel to use, or a porcelain-lined kettle. 

Be careful to select perfectly sound fruit or vegetables for 
pickling, and use none but the very best cider vinegar. 
Good white wine vinegar does well for some sorts of pickles, 
but be ever watchful against chemical preparations called 
vinegar, that destroy instead of preserving the articles put 
away in them. In the selection of spices there is so much 
diversity of taste that no general directions will be of prac- 
tical value. But get the purest articles you can find. 

Pickles must be kept from the air. It is a good plan to 

224 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS, 225. 

put them up in large jars, and for use to empty the large 
jar at once into smaller ones, using these one at a time. 
Keep them wholly covered with the vinegar. Water will 
soon cause the jar of pickles to spoil. 

The same hints given above apply to the making of cat- 
sup, which is really but a pickle cooked to a more advanced 
point. It needs to be tightly corked and sealed, that it may 
keep well. 

RECIPES. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Make a weak brine, hot or cold ; if hot, 
let the cucumbers stand in it twenty-four hours ; if cold, 
forty-eight hours ; rinse and dry the cucumbers with a cloth, 
take vinegar enough to cover them, allow one ounce of 
alum to every gallon of vinegar, put it in a brass kettle (or 
porcelain-lined, if the greening is not desired) with the 
cucumbers, and heat slowly, turning the cucumbers from 
the bottom frequently ; as soon as they are heated through, 
skim them out into a crock, let the vinegar boil up, turn it 
over the pickles, and let them stand at least twenty-four 
hours ; drain off the vinegar. Take fresh vinegar, and to 
every gallon allow two tablespoofuls of white mustard-seed, 
one of cloves, one of celery-seed, one of stick cinnamon, 
one large, green pepper, a very little horse-radish, and, if 
you like, one-half pint of sugar. Divide the spices equally 
into several small bags of coarse muslin, scald with the vine- 
gar, and pour over the pickles. If you like your pickles 
hard, let the vinegar cool before pouring over them. 

Cucumber Pickles, No. 2. — To a gallon of water add a quart 
of salt, put in the cucumbers, and let them stand over night. 
In the morning, wash them out of the brine, and put them 
carefully into a stone jar. Boil a gallon of vinegar, put in, 
while cold, quarter of a pound of cloves, and a tablespoon- 
ful of alum ; when it boils hard, skim it well and turn over 
the cucumbers. In a week they will be fit for use.

226 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Pickled Onions. — Select small white onions, put them over 
the fire in cold water with a handful of salt. When the 
water becomes scalding hot, take them out and peel off the 
skins, lay them in a cloth to dry; then put them in a jar. 
Boil half an ounce of allspice and half an ounce of cloves 
in a quart of vinegar. Take out the sp'ce and pour the 
vinegar over the onions while it is hot. Tie up the jar when 
the vinegar is cold, and keep it in a dry place. 

Pickled Onions, No. 2. — Take small, white onions and peel 
them ; lay them in salt water for two days ; change the water 
once; then drain and put them in bottles. Take vinegar 
enough to cover them, spice with whole mixed spices, scald 
it, and pour over the onions. 

Pickled Garlic and Eschalots. — Garlic and eschalots may be 
pickled in the same way as onions. 

Pickled Nasturtiums. — Nasturtiums should be gathered 
quite young, and a portion of the buds, when very small, 
should be mixed with them. Prepare a pickle by dissolv- 
ing an ounce and a half of salt in a quart of pale vinegar, 
and throw in the berries as they become fit, from day to 
day. They are used instead of capers for sauce, and by 
some persons are preferred to them. When purchased for 
pickling, put them at once into a jar and cover them well 
with the vinegar. 

Pickled Watermelon.— Take the outer part of the rind of 
the melon, pare and cut in small pieces. To one quart of 
vinegar add two pounds of sugar, one ounce of cassia buds. 
In this boil the rind until clear and tender. 

Pickled Walnuts. — Walnuts for this pickle must be gathered 
while a pin can pierce them easily. When once the shell 
can be felt, they have ceased to be in a proper state for it. 
Make sufficient brine to cover them well, with six ounces of 
salt to the gallon of water ; take off the scum, which will 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 227 

rise to the surface as the salt dissolves, throw in the walnuts, 
and stir them night and morning ; change the brine every 
three days, and if they are wanted for immediate eating, 
leave them in it for twelve days; otherwise, drain them 
from it in nine, spread them on dishes, and let them remain 
exposed to the air until they become black ; this will be in 
twelve hours, or less. Make a pickle for them with some- 
thing more than half a gallon of vinegar to the hundred, a 
teaspoonful of salt, two ounces of black pepper, three of 
bruised ginger, a drachm of mace, and from a quarter to 
half an ounce of cloves (of which some may be stuck into 
three or four small onions), and four ounces of mustard- 
seed. Boil the whole of these together for about five min- 
utes ; have the walnuts ready in a stone jar, or jars, and 
pour the vinegar on them as soon as it is taken from the fire. 
When the pickle is quite cold, cover the jar securely and 
store it in a dry place. Keep the walnuts always well 
covered with vinegar, and boil that which is added to them. 

Pickled Red Cabbage. — Slice the red cabbage into a colan- 
der, and sprinkle each layer with salt ; let it drain two days, 
then put it into a jar and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put in a few slices of red beet-root. Use the 
purple red cabbage. Cauliflower cut in bunches, and 
thrown in after being salted, will take on the color of a 
beautiful red. 

Pickled Mushrooms. — Rub the mushroom heads with flan- 
nel and salt, throw them in a stewpan with a little salt over 
them ; sprinkle with pepper and a small quantity of mace ; 
as the liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them 
over a gentle fire until all the liquor is dried into them 
again ; then put as much vinegar into the pan as will cover 
them ; give it a scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

Pickled Beets. — Wash the beet perfectly, not cutting any 
of the fibrous roots, lest the juice escape; put in sufficient 



228 THE HO USE WIFE' S L IBRAR Y. 

water to boil it, and when the skin will come off easily it is 
sufficiently cooked, and may be taken out and laid upon a 
cloth to cool. Having rubbed off the peel, cut the beet 
into thick slices, pour over it cold vinegar prepared as fol- 
lows : Boil a quart of vinegar with an ounce of whole black 
pepper and an equal weight of dry ginger, and let it stand 
until quite cold. Keep closely corked. 

Pickled Peppers. — Do not pick them till just as they begin 
to turn red ; then soak them for ten or twelve days in strong 
salt and water ; take them from the brine and soak them 
in clear water for a day. Wipe them dry, and put them 
away in cold vinegar ; or if you wish them milder, remove 
the seeds and scald the vinegar, but do not boil. 

Pickled Bell Peppers. — Cut a slit in the side of each pepper 
and take out all the seeds. Let them soak in brine (strong 
enough to float an ^^^ two days. Then, washing them in 
cold water, put them into a stonejar. Pour over them vine- 
gar boiled with cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg. Whenever 
they are wanted to be served, stuff each one with a boiled 
tongue cut into dice and mixed with a mayon7iaise dressing. 
Or little mangoes may be made, stuffing each one with 
pickled nasturtiums, grapes, minced onions, red cabbage, or 
cucumbers, seasoned with mustard-seed, root ginger, and 
mace. 

Pepper-hash. — Take four dozen peppers, two very large 
cabbages, one ounce of light mustard-seed. Chop the 
peppers fine, cut the cabbage on a cabbage-knife, mix to- 
gether, salt well, and let it stand over night, putting the 
dish or tub so the juice will run down ; pour off in the 
morning. Add one ounce of cloves, one ounce of allspice ; 
mix all through, and put the vinegar on cold. 

Flint Pickles. — Make a brine of a gallon of water and a 
cupful of salt. This must be poured boiling hot on the cu- 
cumbers six days in succession. Rinse them in cold water; 



PICKLES AND CA TSUPS. 229 

put them in a kettle with a teaspoonful of allspice and a tea- 
spoonful of cloves, a handful of cinnamon sticks, a little 
sliced horse-radish, and cider vinegar to cover them. Let 
them come to a boil, then take out and put in jars. 

East India Pickle. — One hundred cucumbers (large and 
small), one peck of green tomatoes, one-half peck of onions, 
four cauliflowers, four red peppers (without the seeds), four 
heads of celery, one pint of bottled horse-radish. Slice all, 
and stand in salt twenty-four hours, then drain ; pour on 
weak vinegar ; stand on stove until it comes to a boil ; then 
drain again. Take one ounce of ground cinnamon, one 
ounce of ground tumeric, one-half pound of mustard, one- 
quarter pound of brown sugar; wet these with cold vinegar; 
add to this sufficient vinegar to moisten all the pickles. 
Cook all together ten minutes. Seal in bottles while hot. 

French Pickle. — Take one peck of green tomatoes, sliced ; 
six large onions. Throw on them a teacupful of salt over night. 
Drain thoroughly, then boil in two quarts of water and one 
quart of vinegar fifteen or twenty minutes; drain in colan- 
der ; then take four quarts of vinegar, two pounds of brown 
sugar, one-half pound of white mustard-seed, two table- 
spoonfuls of cloves, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, two 
tablespoonfuls of ginger, two tablespoonfuls of ground 
mustard, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper ; put all to- 
gether and cook fifteen minutes. 

Piccallily. — One peck of green tomatoes sliced, one-half 
peck of onions sliced, one cauliflower, one peck of small cu- 
cumbers. Leave in salt and water twenty-four hours ; then

till thick ; then bottle and seal tightly. / 

Walnut Catsup. — The vinegar in which walnuts have been 
pickled, when they have remained in it a year, will generally 
answer all the purposes for which this catsup is required, 
particularly if it be drained from them and boiled for a few 
minutes, with a little additional spice and a few eschalots , 
but where the vinegar is objected to, it may be made by

walnuts, strewing among them as they are done half a 
pound of salt ; then pour to them a quart of strong vinegar 
and let them stand until they have become quite black, 
keeping them stirred three or four times a day ; next add a 
quart of strong, old beer, and boil the whole together for ten 
minutes ; strain it, and let it remain until the next day ; then 
pour it off clear from the sediment, add to it one large head 
of garlic bruised, half an ounce of nutmegs bruised, the same 
quantity of cloves and black pepper, and two drachms of 
mace ; boil these together for half an hour, and the follow- 
ing day bottle and cork the catsup well. 

A bottle of port wine may be added before bottling, if de- 
sired, and a large bunch of sweet herbs. 

Oyster Catsup.^ — Take fine, large fresh oysters, opened care- 
fully, and wash them in their own liquor. To take any par- 
ticle of shell that may remain, strain the liquor after. Pound 
the oysters in a mortar, add the liquor, and to every pint 
put a pint of sherry ; boil it up and skim ; then add two 
anchovies, pounded, an ounce of common salt, two drachms 
of pounded mace, and one of cayenne. Let it boil up, then 
skim, and rub it through a sieve. Bottle when cold and 
seal it. What remains in the sieve will do for oyster sauce.

gathered mushrooms ; put a layer of these at the bottom of 
a deep earthen pan and sprinkle them with salt ; then another 
layer of mushrooms ; sprinkle more salt on them, and so on 
alternately. Let them stand for two or three hours, by 
which time the salt will have penetrated the mushrooms and 
have made them easy to break ; then pound them in a mor- 
tar, or break them well with your hands; let them remain 
in this state for two days, not more, washing them well once 
or twice a day ; then pour them into a stone jar, and to each 
quart add an ounce and a half of whole black pepper and 
half an ounce of allspice ; stop the jar very close, and set it 
in a saucepan of boiling water and keep it boiling for two 
hours at least. Take out the jar and pour the juice clear 
from the settlings through a hair sieve into a clean stewpan, 
and boil it very gently on a slow fire for half an hour. 

Mushroom Catsup without Spice. — Sprinkle a little salt over 
your mushrooms. Three hours after, mash them ; next day, 
strain off the liquor and boil it till it is reduced to half It 
will not keep long, but an artificial mushroom bed will 
supply this, the very best mushroom catsup, all the year 
round.

RECIPES FOR BEVERAGES. 



ASIDE from the spirituous and malt liquors, the composi- 
tion of which is not attempted in the household, there 
is a long line of beverages concerning which some 
hints are of value. In general, it maybe said, employ good 
materials, and do not stint them in quantity, if you want 
good results. What is worth doing at all in culinary lines 
is worth doing well, and beverages, being in the line of lux- 
uries, should be good, if not positively luxuriant. 

Tea is the leaf of the tea-tree cured in various ways, and 
so appearing* in the various forms known to commerce. 
Black teas are subjected to the action of heat far beyond the 
green teas. The green teas go through a greening process 
also, the healthfulness of which may well be questioned. 

Of the black teas, the Pekoe is the earliest gathered and 
mildest, while the Souchong, the Congou, and the Bohea 
are respectively older in growth and stronger in flavor. 

Of the green teas, the Young Hyson is from the tenderest 
and mildest leaf, the Gunpowder, Hyson, and Twankay 
being of older growth respectively and of stronger flavor. 
The treatment of all these leaves, as well as their age, are 
important factors in their final quality.

BEVERAGES. 235 

The nutritive value of tea is not appreciable, but as an ex- 
citant of respiratory action and a promoter of digestion it is 
very valuable. Tea should be kept closely covered in air- 
tight canisters, in order that the flavor may be retained. 

Coffee will grow in any climate where the temperature 
does not fall below fifty-five degrees. The best brands are 
^^ Mocha 2cVidi the Java, but South America supplies the 
largest amount used in this country, which is sold under the 
general name of Rio. Coffee is often wretchedly adulterated, 
especially when sold in the roasted and ground form. It is 
safer to buy it green and to roast and grind it at home. 

Roasted coffee should be kept in tight canisters or boxes, 
and it should be ground only as it is wanted for use. The 
coffeepot must be scalded clean and occasionally with soda, 
so that the inside may be absolutely pure. 

Chocolate should never be made except it is intended to 
be used immediately. By allowing it to become cold or 
by boiling it again, the flavor is injured, the oily particles of 
the cocoa are separated and rise to the surface also, and they 
will never blend pleasantly again. 

Other beverages are in occasional use, but those already 
mentioned are the standards in this land. 



RECIPES. 

Tea. — People must consult their own tastes as to the kind 
of tea. A mixed tea is generally preferred, combining the 
flavors of both green and black. Allow one teaspoonful 
for each person. Use boiling water, but do not boil the tea, 
and use while fresh. Tea is best made in an earthen teapot. 
It should never be made in tin. 

Iced Tea. — Iced tea should be made several hours before it 
is needed and then set upon ice. When ready to use it, 
sweeten and drink without milk or cream. Use cracked ice 



236 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE Y. 

to put into the glass. The tea must be extra strong, and do 
not stint the ice. 

Tea a la Russe. — Slice fresh, juicy lemons; pare them 
carefully, lay a piece in the bottom of each cup ; sprinkle 
with white sugar and pour the tea, very hot and strong, 
over them. 

Iced Tea a la Russe. — To each goblet of cold tea (without 
cream) add the juice of half a lemon. Fill up with 
pounded ice and sweeten well. A glass of champagne 
added to this makes what is called Russian punch. 

, Coffee. — To make choicest coffee, take equal quantities of 
Java and Mocha ; grind finely together, allowing about two 
teaspoonfuls of ground coffee to each person ; add an ^^^ 
with its shell and a very little cold water ; stir this thor- 
oughly together and turn on boiling water. Set the pot on 
the back of the range for five minutes ; then draw forward 
and allow it to boil up just an instant ; clear the spout by 
pouring from it and returning it in the top of the pot. Then 
serve at once with plenty of cream and sugar. 

Iced Coffee. — Make the coffee extra strong. When it is 
cold, mix with an equal quantity of fresh cream ; sweeten to 
taste, and freeze as in ice-cream, or serve with abundance of 
broken ice. 

Cafe Noir. — This is the strongest preparation of coffee, its 
very essence, indeed. It is used after dessert at course din- • 
ners. Make the coffee strong and clear as possible, but use 
only one-third the ordinary quantity of water. Serve with 
lump sugar, with which it should be highly sweetened, and 
use very small cups. Cream may be added if desired. 

Meiingued Coffee.— For six cupfuls of coffee take about 
one cupful of sweet cream, whipped light, with a little sugar. 
Put into each cup the desired amount of sugar and about 
a tablespoonful of boiling milk. Pour the coffee over these, 



BEVERAGES. 237 

and lay upon the surface of the hot liquid a large spoonful 
of the frothed cream. Give a gentle stir to each cup before 
sending it from the tray. 

Frothed Cafe au Lait. — Pour into the table urn one quart 
of strong, clear coffee, strained through muslin, and one 
quart of boiling milk, alternating them, and stirring gently. 
Cover and wrap a thick cloth about the urn for five minutes 
before it goes to table. Have ready in a cream-pitcher the 
whites of three eggs, beaten stiff, and one tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, whipped with them. Put a large spoonful 
of this froth upon each cupful of coffee as you pour it out, 
heaping it slightly in the centre. 

Chocolate. — Scrape fine one square of a cake, which is one 
ounce ; add to it an equal weight of sugar ; put these into 
a pint of boiling milk and water, each one-half, and stir well 
for two or three minutes until the sugar and chocolate are 
well dissolved. This preparation may be improved by 
adding a well-beaten ^gg or two and stirring briskly through 
the mixture with a Dover egg-beater. A teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract added just before sending to table is a valua- 
ble addition. 

Frothed Chocolate. — One cupful of boiling water; three 
pints of fresh milk ; three tablespoonfuls of Baker's choco- 
late, grated ; five eggs, the whites only, beaten light, and two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar for froth. Sweeten the 
chocolate to taste ; heat the milk to scalding ; wet up the 
chocolate with the boiling water, and when the milk is hot, 
stir this into it; simmer gently ten minutes, stirring fre- 
quently ; boil up briskly once ; take from the fire ; sweeten 
to taste, taking care not to make it too sweet, and stir in the 
whites of two eggs, whipped stiff, without sugar ; pour into 
the chocolate pot or pitcher, which should be well heated. 
Have ready in a cream-pitcher the remaining whites. 



238 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAR Y. 

whipped up with the powdered sugar ; cover the surface of 
each cup with the sweetened meringue before distributing to 
the guests. 

Choca. — This beverage, a favorite with many, is made by 
mixing coffee and chocolate, as prepared for the table, in 
equal quantities, and serving hot for breakfast. 

Broma. — Dissolve a large tablespoonful of Baker's broma 
in as much warm water ; then pour upon it a pint of boiling 
milk and water, in equal proportions, and boil it two min- 
utes longer, stirnng it frequently ; add sugar at pleasure. 

BreaMast Cocoa. — Into a breakfast cup put a teaspoonful of 
the powder, add a tablespoonful of boiling water, and mix 
thoroughly. Then add equal parts of boiling water and 
boiled milk, and sugar to the taste. Boiling two or three 
minutes will improve it. 

Cocoa Shells. — Take a small quantity of cocoa shells (say 
two ounces), pour upon them three pints of boiling water, 
boil rapidly thirty or forty minutes ; allow it to settle 
or strain, and add cream or boiling milk and sugar at 
pleasure. 

Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice of lemons, and add sugar 
and ice-water to taste. 

Concentrated Lemonade. — Make a rich sirup of two and a 
half pounds of sugar and one pint of cold water and boil 
gradually. Pour it hot on one and a half ounces of citric 
acid. Bottle tight while hot. One tablespoonful will make 
a tumblerful of lemonade. 

Portable Lemonade. — Mix a quarter pound of white sugar 
with the grated rind of a large, juicy lemon. Pour upon 
this the strained juice of the lemon and pack in a jar. One 
tablespoonful will suffice for a glass of water. 

Egg Nog. — To the yelks of six eggs, add six tablespoon- 
fuls of powdered sugar, one quart of new milk, a half pint 



BEVERAGES. 239 

of French brandy, and one pint of Madeira wine. Beat the 
whites up separately, and stir them through the mixture just 
before pouring into glasses for use. 

Roman Punck — Beat stiff the whites of three eggs, with a 
half pound of powdered sugar. Add three teacupfuls of 
strong, sweet lemonade, one wineglassful each of rum and 
champagne, and the juice of two oranges. Ice abundantly, 
or freeze. 

Milk PuncL — Boil one quart of milk, warm from the cow. 
Beat up the yelks of four eggs and four tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar together; add two glasses of the best 
sherry wine ; pour into a pitcher, and mix with it the boil- 
ing milk, stirring all the time. Pour from one vessel to 
another six times ; add cinnamon and nutmeg to taste, and 
serve as soon as it can be swallowed without scalding the 
throat. 

Currant and Raspberry Shrub.— Pound four quarts of ripe 
currants and three quarts of red raspberries in a stone jar or 
wide-mouthed crock with a wooden beetle. Squeeze out 
every drop of the juice; put this into a porcelain, enamel, 
or very clean bell-metal kettle, and boil hard ten minutes. 
Put in four pounds of loaf sugar at the end of the ten min- 
utes, and boil up once to throw the scum to the top ; skim 
and let it get perfectly cold ; then skim off all remaining 
impurities ; add one quart of the best brandy and shake 
hard for five minutes. Bottle, seal the corks, and lay the 
bottles on their sides in dry sawdust. 

Currant Wine. — One quart of currant juice, three pounds 
of brown sugar, and one gallon of water ; dissolve the sugar 
in the water, then add the juice ; when it ferments, add a 
little fresh water each day till it is done fermenting, which 
will be in from a month and a half to two months ; turn it 
off, scald the keg, put it in again, and cork tightly. 



240 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

Raspberry Wine. — Bruise the raspberries with the back of 
a spoon ; strain them through a flannel bag ; add one pound 
of loaf sugar to one quart of juice; stir weir and cover 
closely, letting it stand for three days, stirring well each 
day. Pour off the clear juice and add one quart of juice 
to two quarts of sherry wine; bottle it and use in two 
weeks. 

Raspberry Brandy. — Using brandy instead of wine, as 
above, will produce a very valuable medicinal drink, Rasp- 
berry Brandy. 

Raspberry Vinegar.— Take three pints of red berries ; pour 
over them one pint of cider vinegar and let stand twenty- 
four hours. Strain, and to one pint of juice add one 
pound of sugar ; boil one-half hour, and when cold, bottle 
for use. 

Cherry Brandy. — Use either morello cherries or small black 
cherries ; pick them from the stalks ; fill the bottles nearly 
up to the necks, then fill up with brandy (some use whisky, 
gin, or spirit distilled from the lees of wine). In three 
weeks or a month strain off the spirit ; to each quart add 
one pound of loaf sugar clarified, and flavor with tincture 
of cinnamon or cloves. 

Sherbet. — In a quart of water boil six or eight sticks of 
rhubarb ten minutes ; strain the boiling liquor on the thin 
shaved rind of a lemon. Two ounces of clarified sugar, 
with a wineglassful of brandy, stir to the above, and let it 
stand five or six hours before using. 

Ginger Beer. — Two ounces of ginger to a pint of molasses ; 
add a gallon of warm water; stir it well, and add half a pint 
of lively yeast. If you wish it sweeter or hotter, add gin- 
ger or molasses before putting in the yeast, to suit your 
taste. 



BEVERAGES. 241 

Spruce Beer. — To three gallons of boiling water, add two 
pounds of molasses and two ounces of essence of spruce. 
Let the mixture cool, and when lukewarm, add a scant gill 
of yeast and set aside to ferment. While the fermentation 
goes on, skim frequently. When it becomes inactive, put in 
stone bottles and tie the corks down. White sugar may be 
used instead of molasses, and will give a better color. 

Quick Beer. — To fourteen quarts of water add one quart of 
molasses, one quart of hop yeast, and four tablespoonfuls of 
ginger. Mix well ; strain through a fine sieve ; bottle im- 
mediately. Ready for use in twenty-four hours. 

Imperial. — Mix in a jug one-half ounce of cream tartar 
and one quart of boiling water ; flavor with lemon peel or 
essence of lemon, and sweeten to taste. This is a refreshing 
and pleasantly stimulating summer drink. 

Mead. — Mix six gallons of water with six quarts of 
strained honey ; add the yellow rind of two large lemons, 
pared thin, and the whites of three eggs beaten to a stiff 
froth. Mix well and boil three-quarters of an hour, skim- 
ming thoroughly. Pour into a tub, add three tablespoonfuls 
of good yeast, and leave it ferment. When it is well worked, 
pour into a barrel with some lemon peel, and let it stand six 
months. Then bottle and tie down the corks. It is ready 
for immediate use, or will keep for months in a cool place.

XIX.— CANDIES. 

CARE NEEDED TO COOK CANDY ; WHEN COOKED ENOUGH ; FLAVOR- 
ING, COOLING, AND PULLING. TWENTY-ONE RECIPES FOR CANDY. 

THE great danger in candy-making is that of burning the 
sugar. To properly cook the candy requires a heat of 
about two hundred and fifty degrees. Less than that 
heat will leave the candy soft and sticky. A very little more 
than two hundred and sixty degrees will burn it. Here, 
then, is the need of care in candy-making. 

In the cooking, allow the heat to reach the bottom of the 
pan only. Have a quick fire that the work may be done in 
the shortest possible time. When cooked for about fifteen 
minutes, test a spoonful of the mass upon a cold plate. If it 
form a viscid, tenacious mass, which forms a long, adherent 
thread when drawn out, then it is nearly done, and it needs 
special care lest it burn before the work be completed. Test 
frequently now, dropping a little in cold water. When the 
hardened portion is crisp as a pipestem, the cooking has 
gone far enough. Then comes the flavoring and coloring. 

When the mass has cooled on a stone or buttered plate, 
so that it can be handled, it is ready ior pulling^ rolling into 
sticks, shaping into forms, etc. The pulling process is 
simply a mechanical means of whitening the candy. It is 
literally 2. pulling, the candy being thrown on a hook and 
pulled out from it, then being thrown on it again and again 
pulled, and so on, as maybe desired, the longer pulling giv- 
ing the whiter candy. 

For home-made candies use pure materials and good 
fruit. Enough of earths and starch and decayed fruits are 
bought in the cheap candies of the stores.

CANDIES. 243' 

RECIPES. 

Molasses Candy. — Three cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half 
cupful of molasses, one cupful of water, one-half teaspoonful 
of cream tartar, butter the size of a walnut. Bring to a boil, 
and when crisp by testing in cold water, flavor ; pour out on 
a buttered plate, and pull to whiteness if desired. 

Butter Scotch. — Two cupfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls 
of water, a piece of butter the size of an ^'g^. Boil without 
stirring, until it hardens on a spoon. Pour out on buttered 
plates to cool. 

Ice-cream Candy. — Take two cupfuls of granulated sugar, 
half a cupful of water, and add one-quarter of a teaspoonful 
of cream tartar dissolved in a teaspoonful of boiling water. 
Put it in a porcelain kettle, and boil ten minutes without 
stirring it. Drop a few drops into a saucer of cold water oi 
on snow. If it become brittle, it is done ; if not, boil till it is. 
Add a piece of butter half as large as an ^g<g while it is on 
the fire, and stir it in. Pour into a buttered tin, and set on 
ice or snow to cool enough to pull it white. Flavor with 
vanilla just before it is cool enough to pull. Work into 
strands and cut into sticks. 

Cream Candy. — One pound of white sugar, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, one teaspoonful of lemon extract, one 
teaspoonful of cream tartar. Add a little water to moisten 
the sugar, and boil until brittle. Put in the extract, then 
turn quickly out on buttered plates. When cool, pull until 
white, and cut in squares. 

Cocoanut Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoanut, spread 
it on a dish, and let it dry naturally for three days, as it will 
not bear the heat of an oven, and is too oily for use when 
freshly broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound 
of sugar for most tastes, but more can be used at pleasure. 
To one pound of sugar, take one-half pint of water, a very 



244 ^^^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

little white of egg, and then pour over the sugar ; let it 
stand for a short time, then place over a very clear fire, and 
let it boil for a few minutes ; then set it one side until the 
scum is subsided, clear it off, and boil the sugar until very 
thick ; then strew in the nut, stir and mix it well, and do not 
quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire, but over it, as the nut is liable to burn 
with too fierce a heat. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for cocoanut 
candy. Let the almonds be blanched and perfectly dry, and 
do not throw them into the sugar until they approach the 
candying point. 

Candied Nuts and Fruits. — Three cupfuls of sugar, one cup- 
ful of water ; boil until it hardens when dropped in water, 
then flavor with lemon. It must not boil after the lemon is 
put in. Put a nut on the end of a fine knitting needle, take 
out, and turn on the needle until it is cool. If the candy 
gets cold, set on the stove for a few minutes. Malaga 
grapes, and oranges quartered, may be candied in the same 
way. 

Chocolate Caramels. — Two cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of 
warm water, one-half cupful of grated chocolate, three- 
fourths of a cupful of butter. Let it boil without stirring 
until it snaps in water. 

Chocolate Caramels, No. 2. — One cupful of rich, sweet cream ; 
one cupful of brown sugar ; one cupful of white sugar; seven 
tablespoonfuls of vanilla chocolate ; one tablespoonful of 
corn-starch, stirred in the cream ; one tablespoonful of but- 
ter ; vanilla flavoring ; soda, the size of a pea, stirred into 
cream. Boil all the ingredients, except the chocolate and 
vanilla extract, half an hour, stirring to prevent burning. 
Reserve half of the cream, and wet up the chocolate in it, 
adding a very little water if necessary. Draw the saucepan 
to the side of the range, and stir this in well ; put back on 



CANDIES. 245 

the fire and boil ten minutes longer, quite fast, stirring con- 
stantly. When it makes a hard, glossy coat on the spoon, 
it is done. Add the vanilla after taking it from the range. 
Turn into shallow dishes, well buttered. When cold 
enough to retain the impression of the knife, cut into 
squares. 

Lemon Taffy. — Two cupfuls of white sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, one-quarter cupful of vinegar, one-half cupful 
of butter ; flavor with lemon ; pour in buttered plates to cool. 

Butter Taffy. — One tablespoonful of vinegar, one cupful of 
sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, and a piece of butter 
the size of an ^%'g. When done, add a little soda. 

Cream Chocolates. — For the creams, boil two cupfuls of 
white sugar and one-half cupful of milk for five minutes ; 
add one teaspoonful of vanilla, then beat until stiff enough 
to handle and make into drops. 

For the chocolate, t^kQ three-quarters of a half-pound cake 
of Baker's chocolate, grate and steam over the teakettle. 
Drop the creams when hard, one at a time, into the hot 
chocolate, using two forks to take them out quickly ; set 
the drop on one fork on the bottom, using the other fork to 
scrape the chocolate off the cream ; gently slip the drop 
upon a buttered dish. If, when cool, the drops stick to the 
dish, hold it over the steam of the teakettle for an instant. 

Chocolate Creams. — Inside : Two cupfuls of sugar ; one cup- 
ful of water ; one and a half tablespoonfuls of arrow-root ; 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Mix the ingredients, except the 
vanilla ; let them boil from five to eight minutes ; stir all the 
time. After this is taken from the fire, stir until it comes to 
a cream. When it is nearly smooth, add the vanilla and 
make the cream into balls. 

Outside : Melt a half pound of Baker's chocolate, but do 
not add water to it. Roll the cream balls into the chocolate 
while it is warm. 



246 ^-^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

Cream Walnuts. — Two cupfuls sugar, two-thirds cupful 
water. Boil without stirring until it will spin a thread ; 
flavor with vanilla. Set off into a dish with a little cold 
water in it ; stir briskly until white and creamy. Have the 
walnuts shelled ; make the cream into small, round cakes 
with your fingers ; press half a walnut on either side, and 
drop into sifted granulated sugar. 

Cream Dates. — For cream dates, take fresh California dates, 
remove the stones, and fill the centre of dates with the same 
cream as used in cream walnuts. Drop into sugar. 

Peanut Candy. — Boil one scant pint of molasses until it 
hardens in cold water. Stir in two tablespoonfuls of vanilla, 
then one teaspoonful of soda, dry. Lastly, the shelled pea- 
nuts, taken from four quarts measured before shelling. 
Turn out into shallow pans well buttered, and press it down 
smooth with a wooden spoon. 

PMladelpMa Groundnut Cakes. — Boil two pounds of light 
brown sugar in a preserving kettle, with enough water to 
wet it thoroughly and form a sirup. Have ready a quarter 
of a peck of groundnuts (peanuts). When the sugar begins 
to boil, throw in the white of an ^^<g to clear it. Skim and 
try by dropping a little into cold water to see if brittle or 
done. When it is brittle, remove from the fire, and stir in 
the nuts. Drop on wet plates, free from grease. The white 
of ^^^ may be omitted. 

Gum Drops. — Dissolve one pound of gum arabic in one and 
a half pints of water; strain and add one pound of refined 
sugar ; beat until the sugar is entirely dissolved. Flavor to 
taste, and add coloring if desired. Then evaporate with a 
slow heat until the mass is thick as honey. Have a shallow 
box, or dish of fine starch ; in this make a series of dents 
with a rounded stick, the size desired for the gum drops. 
Into each of these indentations drop from a spout, or a 



CANDIES. 247 

Spoon, just enough of the thickened mass to fill the cavity, 
then set away in a warm place till the drops become .suffi- 
ciently set to allow handling. This may require several 
days. 

Jujube Paste. — Dissolve gum arable, and add sugar as for 
gum drops. Evaporate till very thick, and while still warm 
flavor and pour out into shallow tin pans to cool. 

Fig Paste. — Chop up one pound of figs, and boil in a pint 
of water till reduced to a soft pulp. Strain through a fine 
sieve, and add three pounds of sugar. Evaporate over boil- 
ing water till the paste becomes stiff, then pour it into a 
mold of wooden strips tied together. When cool, cut into 
squares ; sugar each well, and put away for use. Flavors 
may bq added to taste, or fresh fruits may be mingled with 
the paste. 

Peppermint Drops.— Mix granulated sugar with enough 
water to form a paste, and put it to boil in a saucepan hav- 
ing a lip from which the contents can be poured or dropped. 
Allow it come almost, but not entirely, to a boil. Stir con- 
tinually. Allow it to cool a little, and flavor to taste with 
strong essence of peppermint. Then drop the mass on 
sheets of tin or of white paper. To drop it properly, allow 
just enough to gather at the lip of the saucepan, and then 
stroke it off with a piece of stiff wire. They should dry in 
a warm place. 




XX.— INVALID DIET. 

INVALIDS NEED THE BEST OF DIET ; WHAT INVALID DIET SHOULD 
furnish; "SICK-DIET KITCHENS;" HOME COOKING FOR THE 
SICK. THIRTY RECIPES FOR SICK-ROOM DIET. 

HAT is more disgusting to an invalid than to be 
served with a liberal supply of food adapted to a 
laboring man or to a person in robust health? Deli- 
cate appetites need to be delicately appealed to with dainty 
dishes, nicely served. But these dishes must be nourishing 
and easily digested. In short, the problem in sick-room 
diet is, how to furnish the patient the most valuable nutri- 
tion in the pleasantest form, and with the least tax upon his 
enfeebled powers. 

To meet this need, organized movements have been made 
in many cities in the line of" Sick-Diet Kitchens." Benevo- 
lent contributions and skilled work are the corner-stones of 
these institutions. The foods are well prepared by compe- 
tent hands. The sick who choose to purchase delicacies 
which can be relied on, can find them at these places.. 
Those who are too poor to purchase, but who are deserving, 
can have them free. Instruction concerning diet for the sick 
is given also. 

But many cannot reach such establishments, and do not 
care to if they can ; hence the chapter of directions given 
below. If anywhere in cookery good materials and skillful 
manipulation are of value it is in cooking for the sick. 

RECIPES. 

Beef Tea. — One pound of lean beef, cut into small pieces. 
Put into a jar without a drop of water, cover tightly, set in 

248 



INVALID DIET. 249 

a pot of cold water. Heat gradually to a boil, and continue 
this steadily for three or four hours, until the meat is like 
white rags and the juice all drawn out. Season with salt to 
taste, and when cold, skim. The patient will often prefer 
this ice-cold. 

Beef Tea, No. 2. — Take lean,3'uicy beef, chopped very finely ; 
cover with cold water, and set on back of the range for two 
hours ; then draw forward, allowing it to heat gradually ; 
then boil for five minutes. Season and strain. 

Mutton Brotll. — One pound of lean mutton, cut small ; one 
quart of water, cold ; one tablespoonful of rice or barley, 
soaked in a very little warm water; four tablespoonfuls 
of milk, salt and pepper, with a little chopped parsley. 
Boil the meat, unsalted, in the water, keeping it closely 
covered, until it falls to pieces. Strain it out, add the soaked 
barley or rice; simmer half an hour, stirring often; stir in 
the seasoning and the milk, and simmer five minutes after it 
heats up well, taking care it does not burn. Serve hot, with 
cream crackers. 

Chicken Broth. — Proceed precisely as above, but substitute 
chicken for mutton. 

Chicken Jelly. — Haifa raw chicken, pounded with a mallet, 
bones and meat together ; plenty of cold water to cover it 
well, about a quart. Heat slowly in a covered vessel, and 
let it simmer until the meat is in white rags and the liquid 
reduced one-half Strain and press, first through a colan- 
der, then through a coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper 
if you think best; return to the fire, and simmer five min- 
utes longer. Skim when cool. Give to the patient cold — 
just from the ice — with unleavened wafers. Keep on the 
ice, or make into sandwiches by putting the jelly between 
thin slices of bread spread lightly with butter. 

Soft Boiled Eggs. — Put in a pan of boiling water, and set on 
a part of the range where they will not boil for several min- 



250 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

utes. At the end of that time they will be like jelly, per- 
fectly soft, but beautifully done, and quite digestible by even 
weak stomachs. 

Egg Gruel. — Beat the yelk of one ^^^ with one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar ; pour one teacupful of boiling water on it ; add 
the white of the ^g% beaten to a froth, with any seasoning 
or spice desired. To be taken warm. 

Raw Egg. — Break a fresh ^g^ into a glass, beat until ver}^ 
light, sweeten to taste, and add two tablespoonfuls of port 
wine, then beat again. 

Egg Cream. — Beat a raw ^^^ to a stiff froth ; add a table- 
spoonful of white sugar and a half wineglass of good black- 
berry wine; add half a glass of cream; beat together 
thoroughly, and use at once. 

Indian-meal Gruel. — One tablespoonful of fine Indian-meal, 
mixed smooth with cold water and a saltspoonful of salt ; 
pour upon this a pint of boiling water and turn into a sauce- 
pan to boil gently for half an hour ; thin it with boiling 
water if it thickens too much, and stir frequently ; when it 
is done, a tablespoonful of cream or a little new milk may 
be put in to cool it after straining, but if the patient's stom- 
ach is weak it is best without either. Some persons like it 
sweetened and a little nutmeg added, but to many it is more 
palatable plain. 

Oatmeal GmeL — Soak a handful of oatmeal over night in 
water, in order that the acid gases which oatmeal contains 
may be withdrawn. Pour off the water, and add a pint of 
fresh ; stir it well, add salt, and boil an hour and a half. 
This is much used, prepared in this way, by dyspeptics. 

Sago. — Soak and wash it well ; add a pint of water, a little 
salt, and boil till clear. Add lemon-juice or wine, if 
permitted. 

Arrow-root JeUy. — Boil a pint of water with a few bits of 



INVALID DIET. 251 

cinnamon or yellow rind of lemon ; stir into it two table- 
spoonfuls of arrow-root, dissolved in a little water ; boil ten 
minutes ; strain, salt, and season with sugar, wine, and nut- 
meg, if proper. 

Arrow-root BrotL — Put half a pint of water into a sauce- 
pan ; add a little lemon-juice, sugar and nutmeg, and a very 
little salt. Boil it up, and stir in a teaspoonful of dissolved 
arrow-root ; boil five minutes. It should be taken warm 
and be very thin. 

Cracked Wheat. — To one quart of hot water take one small 
teacupful of cracked wheat and a little salt ; boil slowly for 
half an hour, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Serve 
with sugar and cream or new milk. 

Cracker Panada. — Six Boston crackers, split ; two table- 
spoonfuls of white sugar, a good pinch of salt, and a little 
nutmeg; enough boiling water to cover them well. Split the 
crackers, and pile in a bowl in layers, salt and sugar scat- 
tered among them. Cover with boiling water and set on 
the hearth, with a close top over the bowl, for at least an 
hour. The crackers should be almost clear and soft as jelly, 
but not broken. Eat from the bowl with more sugar 
sprinkled in. 

Bread Panada. — Set a little water on the fire in a very 
clean saucepan ; add a glass of wine, if allowed, some sugar, 
nutmeg, and lemon-peel. The moment it boils up stir in a 
few crumbs of stale baker's loaf Let it boil very fast for 
five minutes. It should be only thick enough to drink. 

Chicken Panada.— Boil a chicken ; take a few bits of the 
breast and pound fine in a mortar. Season it with a little 
salt, a grate of nutmeg, and a bit of lemon-peel ; boil gently 
till a little thick, but so that it can be drank. 

Soft Toast. — Some invalids like this very much indeed, and 
nearly all do when it is nicely made. Toast well, but not 



252 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

too brown, a couple of thin slices of bread; put them on a 
warm plate and pour over boiling water ; cover quickly with 
another plate of the same size, and drain the water off; re- 
move the upper plate, butter the toast, put it in the oven 
one minute, and then cover again with a hot plate and serve 
at once. 

Milk Porridge. — Two cupfuls of best oatmeal, two cupfuls 
of water, two cupfuls of milk. Soak the oatmeal over night 
in the water; strain in the morning, and boil the water half 
an hour. Put in the milk with a little salt, boil up well, and 
serve. Eat warm, with or without powdered sugar. 

Thickened Milk. — With a little milk, mix smooth a table- 
spoonful of flour and a pinch of salt. Pour upon it a quart 
of boiling milk, and when both are thoroughly mingled put 
all back into the saucepan and boil up once, being careful 
not to burn, and stirring all the time to keep it perfectly 
smooth and free from lumps. Serve with slices of dry toast. 
It is excellent in diarrhoea, and becomes a specific by scorch- 
ing the flour before mixing with the milk. 

Toast Water. — Toast stale bread until quite brown, but do 
not burn it ; put it into a large bowl, and pour over it boil- 
ing water ; let it stand for an hour or so, strain, and put in 
a piece of ice before drinking. 

Barley Water. — Soak one pint of barley in lukewarm water 
for a few minutes ; then drain off the water. Put the barley 
in three quarts of cold water and cook slowly until the 
barley is quite soft, skimming occasionally. This barley 
water, when cold, flavor with a little jelly or lemonade. 

Rice Milk. — Pick and wash the rice carefully ; boil it in 
water until it swells and softens ; when the water is partly 
boiled away, add some milk. It may be boiled entirely in 
milk, by setting the vessel in which the rice is in boiling 
water ; sweeten with white sugar and season with nutmeg. 
It also may be thickened with a little flour or beaten ^%^, 



INVALID DIET. 253 

Flaxseed Tea. — One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound 
of rock candy, and three lemons pared and sliced; pour 
over this two quarts of boiling water ; let it stand until very- 
cold ; strain before drinking. This is good for a cough. 

Appleade. — Cut two large apples in slices, and pour on 
them one pint of boiling water; strain well and sweeten. 
Ice it before drinking. 

Apple Water. — Roast two large, tart apples until they are 
soft. Put them in a pitcher, pour a pint of cold water on 
them, and let them stand in a cool place for an hour. No 
sweetening is needed. This drink will be found very 
refreshing if the patient have fever or eruptive diseases. 

Roast Apples. — Good-sized, juicy, tart apples are best for 
roasting. Wipe them clean, and put in a slow oven, allow- 
ing an hour for the work of roasting. When entirely done, 
sift fine, white sugar over them, and serve warm or cold, as. 
desired. 

Wine Whey. — Sweeten one pint of milk to taste, and when 
boiling throw in two wineglassfuls of sherry ; when the curd 
forms, strain the whey through a muslin bag into tumblers 

Blackberry Sirup. — One quart of blackberry juice, one 
pound of sugar, one-half ounce of nutmeg, one-half ounce 
ot cinnamon, one-fourth of an ounce of cloves, one-fourth 
of an ounce of allspice. 



XXI.— MODERN FACILITIES FOR 
COOKING. 

IMPROVEMENTS multiply on all sides in these days of 
rapid progress, and they have not failed to leave their 
impress on culinary matters. The rude methods of the 
now barbarous nations were once the only methods ot 
cookery. But the better people struggled for better 
methods, and improvements came. These ran to refinements 
here and there, which the richer and more luxurious only 
could adopt. Among those who could afford it, means of 
cooking fairly good won their way rapidly, but the masses 
knew nothing of such indulgences. They long continued to 
put up with inconvenient and inefficient methods. 

Real progress is made when the people as a whole are 
made more comfortable. What lifts up the lower classes is 
real elevation. A spire may tower high amid surroundings 
where the people grovel in marsh and malaria. The spire 
itself may be the best of its kind, but genuine improvement 
would raise the grade where it stands and better the condi- 
tion of the masses at its base. So in cookery. Those 
astounding feasts of the olden time were but spires, shoot- 
ing into conspicuous view, while the people were in beggary 
about them. 

But the culinary grade has been raised. The people are 
better off to-day than ever they were. They have better 
material for food ; they have better knowledge of the uses 
of food, and better facilities for its proper, savory, and health- 
ful preparation. To some of these facilities attention may 
properly be given. 

Open wood fires — mere bonfires, in fact — were the first and 
simplest means of cooking. Over these, boiling could be 

"254 



MODERN FACILITIES FOR COOKING. 255 

done, or broiling, or frying ; before them cabobs could be 
roasted, or toasted, on the end of a stick ; or better viands 
could be cooked on the " spit," or some kindred contrivance 
that would hold the meat in the direct radiation of the fire, 
and turn it continually, so that all sides might be equally 
cooked. In the hot ashes of such fires, vegetables could be 
roasted, and even meats could be prepared. 

From open fires it was but a step to inclosed fire-places, 
by which the draft might be improved, the smoke disposed 
of to better advantage, and the heat be confined and concen- 
trated for more economical employment. Ovens, for baking 
and roasting, naturally followed. As metals came into more 
general use and became cheaper, their employment to form 
stoves was natural. These, at first, were for wood and the 
lighter fuels, but they soon were adapted to coal as its em- 
ployment became general. 

Rivalry among manufacturers rapidly led to improvement 
upon improvement, until we have our splendid stoves — so 
numerous, so beautiful, and yet so effective. An exterior 
view of a standard modern cooking stove, adaptable for 
either wood or coal, is given on the following page ; not that 
it is in appearance novel or unusual, but that it is a fine 
specimen of this splendid line of domestic appliances. 

The best coal stoves of this day, whether for cooking or 
heating purposes, are fitted with the anti-clinker grates. By 
this apparatus, access to the bottom of the fire is had 
directly, and clinkers can be removed as well as the fine 
ashes. The clear bottom, so essential to a strong fire and a 
good heat, can always be secured by this improvement. The 
necessity of letting the fire go out occasionally, so as to 
secure a clear, strong heat, is entirely done away with. A 
perpetual fire may be maintained, and it may always be clear 
and strong. 

The cooking capacity of modern stoves is marvelous. 
The largest family roasts can be managed, with all the vege-

tables pertaining thereto, while at the same time a tank of 
warm water is maintained, dishes are kept warm, etc., etc., 
to the heart's content of the most exacting housewife. The 
home where these facilities are lacking is a home that is 
behind the times and below its privileges. The wives and 
mothers should no more confine themselves to old appli- 
ances for cooking than the men should confine themselves 
to.old methods of agriculture and travel. 




MODERN COOKING-STOVE FOR WOOD OR COAL. 

Permanent ranges have superseded cook-stoves very gen- 
erally in the cities and in the more substantial houses. 
There is much in their favor, not the least item being their 
compactness. In a recess, not of much value for other pur- 
poses, the range may do its all-important work. It never 
projects into the room, or occupies central space, as does the 
stove. Its capacity for union with a system of water dis- 
tribution, so that Jiot water may be supplied to the whole 
house, is a very valuable consideration. Without attention

of any kind it does this work, and for the bath, the laundry, 
and all incidental purposes, its supply is always ready. A 
permanent range may have its ash-pit also, into which the 
entire waste falls, without raising dust or doing damage, and

from which it may be removed, as occasion requires, through 
the cellar, and without interference with the living or work- 
ing parts of the house.

258 I^HE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

The cut of a modern range just given shows most of its 
features of excellence. The anti-chnker grate, with its pecu- 
har contrivance for cleaning the bottom of the fire, is seen. 
This work can be done every morning with less trouble than 
it takes to rake the old kind of ranges, and a continuous 
fire may be kept going always fresh on the grate. By this 
means a quicker fire and hotter oven can be produced. 
The dish-warmer, top shelf, circulating boiler for hot water, 
ovens, draft dampers, etc., etc., all appear. The open oven 
shows the hot-air circulation about it, when the heat is 
turned to it for roasting purposes. Such a range is not 
much more expensive than a stove of equal cooking capa- 
city, but the setting and the plumbing, if it be added, in- 
crease the cost. For ranges of this construction, experts 
claim many marked advantages, among them these: A 
perpetual fire, free from slate or clinkers ; a perfectly heated 
oven, without causing the range to become red hot on top, 
so avoiding the burning out of centre plates and covers ; 
perfection in baking, broiling, boiling, stewing, and every 
variety of cooking ; ample room in the oven ; durability of 
grates and fire-brick and great economy in fuel. These 
ranges have also a hinged broiler plate, which need not be 
lifted off when broiling, but may be simply swung back ; also 
an improved feeder door, which allows perfect control of the 
fire. 

When the stove and range for domestic use are passed 
by, and those for eating-houses, hotels, etc., are to be con- 
sidered, marvels of size and completeness are found. 
Special adaptations are added to these immense culinary 
machines, by which all kinds and almost all amounts of 
work can be done at one time with the utmost possible ease. 
Steam is used very extensively in these operations, espe- 
cially in boiling, but apparatuses on this scale are hardly 
applicable to domestic uses. For most housekeepers, 
the kitchen of a mammoth hotel would be a genuine show, 



MODERN FACILITIES FOR COOKING. 259 

not only in the immensity of its equipment, but also in the 
sublime carelessness with which its operations are carried on. 
But coal, wood, and steam are not the only powers 
applied for cooking in domestic circles. Another claimant 
for recognition, and one rapidly winning his way to the 
front, is found in 

MODERN GAS STOVES. 

These can be used wherever natural or artificial gas is 
supplied for illuminating purposes, either by public or pri- 
vate means. Wherever heat is needed and gas can be had, 
gas stoves have a province. Whether for warming apart- 
ments, supplying heat for mechanical purposes, or for cook- 
ing, gas stoves are carefully adapted to meet the varied 
demands. The purpose in this discussion is not to give the 
pre-eminence to any of the several gas stoves which claim 
public favor, but simply to present the subject as met by 
stoves of one standard make, allowing those who are inter- 
ested to work out the remaining problems for themselves. 

The convenience and comfort of cooking by gas, espe- 
cially during the summer months, when fire is not other- 
wise required, can be thoroughly appreciated only by those 
who have had experience in its use for that purpose. It has 
many advantages, among them these : With a good gas 
cooking-stove the difficulty arising from slow fires, quick fires, 
and bright fires vanish at once and forever in the simple 
turning of a tap, admitting more or less gas, the cook con- 
trolling the fire instead of the fire controlling the cook. The 
cook, having the fire directly under her control, the heat can 
be regulated to a nicety ; it is not variable, and it is as 
readily obtained as it is easy to be got rid of when no longer 
required. Not the least difficult of the many branches of a 
cook's education is the acquirement of experience, in roast- 
ing. She has to calculate and weigh with much nicety both 
the size of the joints and the power of the fire. A good gas 



260 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

oven, however, can be controlled so easily than an even and 
suitable heat is guaranteed. 

Then, too, it is claimed that the waste in meat cooked by 
gas is greatly diminished as compared with that cooked by 
a coal fire. Meat roasted by a coal fire loses one-third in 
weight, or thirty-three and one-third per cent., while the same 
cooked by gas loses only about one-seventh, or fourteen per 
cent. This difference is due to the fact, that by the usual 
methods of roasting, the meats are shut up in a tight oven, 
which, by its dry and highly heated air, extracts and con- 
sumes the moisture of the meats. The gas oven, on the 
other hand, is open. The heating is by direct radiation 
from the reflectors. Less loss results, therefore, by evapo- 
ration of juices than from the tight oven, as the atmosphere 
about the meat is not exhausted of its natural moisture, so 
becoming a drain upon the moisture in the meat. 

The lighting and extinguishing of gas is an instantaneous 
operation, neither entailing the drudgery, waste of fuel, of 
time, or of patience belonging to other methods. And in 
this case there is no coal to bring up, no ashes to empty, no 
kindling-wood needed, no waste of fuel, but a single match 
kindles it all, and the work goes on. 

There has been strong prejudice against cooking by gas, 
which has greatly retarded its general use. Within the last 
few years, however, this has been giving away, as the advan- 
tages of gas for this purpose are becoming more widely 
recognized, and the construction of the stoves has been so 
greatly improved. 

The objections to thus utilizing gas have been chiefly a 
belief in its flavoring the meat, the difficulty of burning it so 
as to avoid smoking and dirt, and its expense as compared 
with other fuel. There can be no doubt that some gas 
stoves are very extravagant and wasteful, nevertheless, the 
objections raised are not regarded as well founded. It can be 
shown satisfactorily that real economy results from their use.

A series of carefully conducted experiments between a 
standard coal range and a standard gas stove is summed up 
in the tables which follow. 

In these experiments the Sun Dial Gas Stove, of the 
Goodwin Gas Stove Company, was used. The results were 
communicated officially to the Convention of Gas Operators 
at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, October i6th,

petent expert. In each case the cooking was done so that 
all the dishes would be completed at once. The tests were 
illustrative of three points : 1st, of the less expense in fuel ; 
2d, of the less shrinkage of the material ; 3d, of the less time 
required from the outset to the completing of the cooking. 
By this test, in shgrt, the gas stove saved as follows: 

In cost of fuel iS cents. 

In shrinkage of articles cooked . . 33IJ 

In time from the start till ready . . 50 minutes. 

Through lack of knowledge, skill, and attention many 
persons will waste shamefully where others will save, but

the above results go far to settle the question of relative 
economy. Experience has settled the question of flavor 
also. There is no more need of ill-flavor in food cooked 
by gas than in food cooked otherwise. In any case, it is a 
result of bad management, not of the kind of fuel. 

After this general survey of gas stoves, a more detailed 
view of them will 
be in order. Be- 
ginning with the 
smaller stoves, the 
first cut presents 
one employing a 
single burner only. 
This stove is only 
seven inches wide, 
seven and a half 
inches high, nine 
inches deep. It has a 
front tin reflector to

pan, whereby the heat is thrown back upon the meat, thereby 
greatly increasing the cooking power. This stove will broil a 
steak, chops, bacon or fish, toast bread, boil water, stew or fry 
with one burner only. Three feet of gas, at a cost of less 
than one cent, will broil a chop and boil a pint of water. 
Consumption, ten cubic feet of gas per hour. 

Departing from the old system of gas cooking, which 
was open to many grave objections, the gas burner in the 
best stoves, like those shown here, is placed above the meat, 
and not under it ; over this burner is fixed a radiating metal 
plate to reflect the heat; the same burner being above the 
meat and beneath the oven, where the oven attachment 
exists, answers both for the purpose of roasting and baking 
at the same time. By another simple contrivance, of sur- 
rounding the oven with a case or jacket, the heat is in- 
creased, the combustion is rendered complete, and a regular

distribution of heat all over the oven is secured. In all 
the stoves now in use, the oven is always hottest in that 
part nearest the fire, consequently it is a common occurence 
for food to be- raw in one part and burnt in another. This 
is prevented by the hot air jacket surrounding the oven. 

The next cut shows the oven attachment, the heat being 
applied beneath it and over the roast, and the heat both 

above and below 
the oven. The size 
of the stove rep- 
resented in this 
picture is twelve 
inches wide, twen- 
ty-two mches high, 
eleven inches deep. 
Its oven is twelve 
inches wide, six 
and a half inches 
high, ten and a half 
inches deep. Its 
roaster is twelve 
inches wide, nine 
inches high, ten 
and a half inches 
deep. Its hot plate 
is thirteen and a half inches wide, sixteen inches long. 
It has two extra burners in the hot plate. Its consump- 
tion, with all burners in use, is twenty cubic feet of gas per 
hour. ' 

A still larp-er stove is shown in the next cut. Its size is 
thirty inches high, fifteen inches wide, and twelve and a half 
inches deep. The oven and roaster are of proportionate 
size, as the cut shows. It has the non-conducting jacket, by 
means of which all of the heat is retained and utilized. . It 
will roast a seven-pound joint or a couple of fowls ; it

with a movable apparatus for supporting the pan at various 
heights. Consumption, with all burners in use, thirty-two 
cubic feet per hour. 

By means of the outlet pipe, a complete carrying away of 
the products of combustion is secured. A system of tubing

combustion as is accomplished by similar means in the ordi- 
nary kinds of fuel. This arrangement fills a want that has 
long been felt by those who have objected to the use of gas 
stoves for the reason of there being no adequate means to 
remove the products of combustion and odors from the 
roasting chambers, ovens, and boiling burners, all of which 
is now effectually accomplished. 

The possibilities of the gas stove are not exhausted, how- 
ever, by the forms already shown. Still another cut is given 
of one of the most complete gas-stoves. This size will do 
all the work for a large family. The size of this stove is 
thirty-six inches high, twenty-four and a half inches wide, 
and twelve and a half inches deep. The oven is nine and a 
half inches high, fifteen inches wide, and eleven inches deep. 
The roaster is thirteen inches high, eighteen inches wide, 
and twelve inches deep. The hot plate is twenty-eight 
inches wide, sixteen and a half inches deep, with two single 
and one double burner ; tray underneath for removing dirt, 
etc. The oven has double jacket for retaining heat. The 
tinned copper boiler, with brass draw-off tops, holds about 
two gallons, and is heated by an atmospheric burner with 
separate tap at side. This stove is capable of doing the 
work of any wood or coal range or stove for a large family ; 
and when^ family once get a little accustomed to its use, 
they will find it superior in every respect. Consumption, 
with all burners in use, forty-two cubic feet per hour. 

Such is a brief showing of the cooking-stoves using gas 
as fuel. With them a household can be relieved of much of 
the work which makes life a burden ; but these helps do not 
apply to family uses only. Hotels have adopted them. 
Stoves and ranges can be furnished to cook for any number 
of persons. At the new hotel at Pullman, III, the cooking 
for a thousand guests is done by gas. The great range of 
this house, if extended in a direct line, would reach forty- 
eight feet. Parts of it stand five feet high. To build it cost 



268 ^-^-^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

one thousand five hundred dollars. It includes a complete 
set of fish broilers, two large hot closets for warming dishes, 
a sixty-gallon tank for the supply of hot water, and six 
large roasting and broiling chambers, over which are forty- 
eight burners for boiling, stewing, and frying. Three large 
ovens, with twenty-four burners over them, are also in- 
cluded in the complete apparatus. 

Another feature in the great gas range of this hotel is its 
carving-table and hot closets. The water in this table is 
heated by a hot-water generator with gas heat, and the 
closets are supplied with two burners each, by which they 
can be raised to any desirable temperature. Egg boilers, 
vegetable boilers, and cake griddles complete this elaborate 
cooking apparatus. 

Water-heating apparatus is a great point in connection 
with the Pullman Range. There are very many of these 
applications which are available in private houses. From 
the little arrangement for heating a pint of water, there are 
others of larger capacity, up to those capable of heating a 
bath-tub full or of providing for a family wash. A very 
convenient apparatus for supplying hot water to a wash 
basin which has cold water onl}^ is shown in the opposite 
cut. The " generator " is placed on a little bracket, and an 
attachment is made from the gas burner, and also from the 
cold-water pipe. On lighting the gas, hot water is gene- 
rated almost instantly, and is supplied in quantity sufficient 
for all probable demands, as the generator contains a coil of 
pipe in passing through which the water can hardly fail of 
being thoroughly heated. The generator can be had in 
ornamental or plain forms, and its consumption of gas is 
but ten cubic feet per hour. 

Rural homes which supply water from a tank can adopt 
this generator with ease. Indeed, wherever water flows 
and a gas jet is available, hot water can be had at plea- 
sure.

Hot closets are made of sizes suitable for domestic pur- 
poses also. That shown in the adjoining cut is but thirty- 
four inches high, twenty-five inches wide, and eighteen

inches deep. The closet is useful to heat dishes and keep 
meats and pastry warih. It can be made of any desired 
dimensions, and can be finished with a high degree of orna- 
mentation if so preferred.

Gas stoves supply many incidental conveniences also that 
are worthy of note. The cut of a simple boiling stove be- 
low illustrates this. 
These are of vari- 
ous diameters, from 
five inches upward. 
They consume from 
seven cubic feet per 
hour upward, and 
for all incidental 
small cookery they 
are very useful. 

Another gas-stove specialty is the Waffle Baker, also 
shown in an illustration. This little apparatus consumes 
about twelve cubic feet of gas per hour, but it does its bak-

ing work quickly and well, wholly avoiding the burning, so 
apt to spoil waffles baked in other ways. Restaurants find 
this apparatus very helpful, and families, too, will enjoy it, as 
long waiting for hot cakes is avoided, and the cakes, when 
served, are just right. The baking molds are so arranged, 
that by a crank attached to the projecting spindle they may 



272 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

be turned over to secure equal baking on both sides. Thus 
the arrangement is perfectly effective while entirely simple. 
In view of what may be done with gas, it is not strange 
that in discussing " The Fuel of the Future " it should re- 
ceive special recognition. Many there are who look to the 
time when coal and wood fires will be virtually unknown in 
the cities, and when arrangements for heating will be like 
those for illumination, furnished by outside parties, and paid 
for as used. In localities where natural gas is found, this is 
already practically realized to a great extent. But there 
are other views as to the fuel of the future, as the next dis- 
cussion will show. Of course, these novelties in domestic 
operations are resisted. Our grandmothers did not do 
things in this way. But again the old text may be quoted : 
" Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good." 



OIL STOVES. 



MODERN facilities in the way of cook-stoves are not 
restricted to places where gas is available. In small 
villages, and in purely rural homes, oil may be used 
for cooking, as for illuminating purposes, in the place of gas. 
Which of various oil stoves is the best is not our province 
to decide, nor is such a decision necessary. But it is our 
province to illustrate the subject of oil stoves fully, which 
will be done by reference to one good standard stove, from 
which others do not differ, probably, in any very important 
respects. 

In the Florence oil stove there is a cast-iron base, more 
or less elevated, which is the receiver of* the oil, which 
should be of the best quality. Such oils, being purer than 
others, are less liable to produce smoke and unpleasant 
odor, which are certainly objectionable. 

From this oil-receiver the wick, or wicks, proceed, each 



MODERN FACILITIES FOR COOKING, 



273 




furnishing a flame four inches in width, and regulated, as in 
oil-lamps, by thumb-screws. Over these wicks is the stove 
apparatus, with various adaptations for warming or for 
cooking, and of varying powers, as may be desired. The 
chamber immediately above the flame is capable of easy re- 
moval or of being thrown backward on a hinge joint, to 
allow access to the wicks 
for trimming and to fa- 
cilitate cleansing the ap- 
paratus. The oil-receiv- 
ing base, the regulating 
screws for three wicks, 
the heat chamber, with 
the flames seen through 
the mica doors, and the 
top work, capable of va- 
rious applications, are all 
shown in the adjacent cut. oil stove with cooking drum. 

For some uses the amount of flame secured by three 
wicks is more than is needed. Smaller contrivances are, 
therefore, prepared, one of which, called the Nursery Stove, 
is shown in the cut. Much less oil is 
required here, one wick only is used, 
and yet the kettle may be boiled, an iron 
heated, or almost any light culinary work 
be done. Beyond the nursery, this little 
stove is especially adapted for use by 
milliners, dressmakers, druggists, bar- 
bers, saloon-keepers, and for manufac- 
turers, to heat glue, to heat irons, etc. 
It is perfectly safe for use in the home, 
or in factories and shops. It is strong enough to sustain a 
weight of two hundred pounds, and cooking utensils of any 
kind can be used upon it when desired. Offices, libraries, 
etc., will find it of great value too.

THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



A very helpful use of small oil stoves is found by parties 
camping out or going on picnics. The whole apparatus is 
easily carried, and it is ready to boil a kettle, to fry a mess 
of fish, or to do any of the many little things for which a 
fire is needed on a camp-ground. It is often desirable to 
have a little heat in the home late in the spring or early in 
the fall, or on a cool and rainy summer day, or in case of 
sickness, when the chill needs to be taken from a room. 
The stoves are down ; the furnace is dismantled ; there is no 
fireplace in the room ; but you have an oil stove. All right 
then. Remove the cooking top, and add a heating drum ; 
in other words, transform the stove as shown in the first cut 

to the stove as seen in 
adjoining cut. This is 
ornamental and effective, 
affording ample heat in 
all ordinary weather for 
rooms of usual size. One 
wick only of the three 
shown in this stove may 
be used at a time if less 
heat is desired. 

Adhering to the same 
three-wick base, it may, 
however, become desira- 
ble to enlarge the cook- 
ing resources. This may 
be easily accomplished. 
On the cooking drum a 
broad Extension Top is 
readily adjustable. This 
is of cast iron, and it is so fitted with dampers that heat can 
be concentrated at any one point of the extension, or dif- 
fused with available cooking power among them all. The 
cut on the next page shows the oven, the teakettle, the Steam

Cooker, and the saucepan, all in operation. The Steam 
Cooker is a contrivance to economize room. In its lower 
part is a waterpan, over which are other tiers of pans, in 
each of which a different vegetable may be cooked at one 
and the same ==^^^ 

time by means of 
steam from the 
boiling water be- 
low. Thus a lit- 
tle stove may do 
a great work. 

For a heavier 
culinary demand 
an enlarged ap- 
paratus may be 
employed. This 
is nothing more 
nor less than a 
doubling of what 
has already been 
described. The 
cut on page 276, 
illustrates a dou- 
ble stove, with 
elevating stand and extension top. This is regarded as 
ample accommodation for a family of six persons. It per- 
forms all the offices of the most elaborate kitchen range, and 
for roasting meats, broiling and baking is unequaled by 
them, for the reason that in no stove or range is the fire and 
consequent heat so completely under control of the cook. 
Various designs of these stoves are prepared, which con- 
tain all the most approved principles of construction, and 
are especially happy in the effects obtained, the trimmings 
being elaborately nickled and really very Iiandsome. 

In the running of these stoves, the principles to be 




OIL STOVE WITH EXTENSION TOP AND 
EQUIPMENTS. 



276 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



observed are few and simple. The gist of them are added 
below as illustrative of the processes. 

Any good kerosene oil suitable to burn in lamps can be 
used for the best results in cooking and heating, or to avoid 
odor the best water white oil, of not less than one hundred 
and fifty degrees, fire test, is recommended. The best at 
command will in all cases be found the most satisfactory. 




DOUBLE OIL STOVE WITH EXTENSION TOP. 

Only such wicks as are furnished for this especial purpose 
should be used. They can be sent by mail when desired. 
Be certain the wick fills the wick tube, to prevent escape of 
gas. New wicks produce best results, because they afford 
free passage, for oil. Wicks which have stood in oil for a 
length of time become clogged with paraffine and foreign 
substances. Changing wicks as often as four to six weeks 
IS therefore desirable. 

Fill the reservoir with oil, but do not run it over. One- 



MODERN FACILITIES FOR COOKING. 277 

wick stoves hold one quart; two-wIck stoves hold two 
quarts; three-wick stoves hold three quarts; four-wick 
stoves hold six quarts. Trim the wicks evenly, slightly 
rounding the corners. When new wicks are put in, wait 
until they become saturated with oil before lighting. Use 
the same care in regulating the flame which is required for 
an ordinary kerosene lamp. Wicks should never be so 
turned down that the flame will be below the top of the 
cones. 

It is important that the stove be kept perfectly clean> 
There should be a regular time (daily when the stove is in 
constant use) for filling the reservoir and wiping the stove 
clean in every part. The perforated circular plate which sets 
over the wick tubes must be kept clean. When the stove 
is not in use, the wick should be turned down a little below 
the top of the wick tubes, so that the oil will not flow out- 
side of the base. The wick tubes should be thoroughly 
cleaned from crusts and deposits, and rubbed bright as 
often as once a week ; a piece of sand-paper is convenient 
to use for this purpose. This is important to insure a per- 
fect flame and prevent undue heating of the tubes. Before 
setting the stove aside for a length of time, empty the oil, 
and before filling it again rinse out well and put in new 
wicks. A clean stove, new wicks, and fresh oil of the right 
grade, will insure satisfactory results.. 

In extinguishing the burners, simply turn the wick down 
a little below the top of the wick tube and leave the flame 
to go out of itself In this way all gases are consumed and 
smell of oil avoided. 

With care in- observing such plain hints, the oil stove 
may become a very helpful and convenient accessory in the 
affairs of every house. Housekeepers should certainly give 
them attention when the question of home comfort arises.

KITCHEN UTENSILS. 

POTS, kettles, pans, and such common-place articles have 
been familiar to every housewife, time immemorial. But 
even these have not escaped the transforming touch of 
improvement. Take, as an example, the common soup-pot. 
Its old style of lid would lie loosely when the heat was 
doing its work, allowing the rich odors to escape and the 
steam to waste. Now the lid is clamped tight on the pot, 
a valve allowing steam to escape when it must, and so re- 
taining in the pot all the heat and flavor which can possibly 
be held there. The fact is, that business rivalry has stimu- 
lated inventors, manufacturers, and dealers to seek for per- 
fect articles. The result is that housekeepers may be splen- 
didly supplied. 

When a complete kitchen equipment is urged, penny-wise 
and pound-foolish housewive? cry out against the cost. 
Better, however, spare some expensive adornment else- 
where, and fit up the kitchen as becomes the cooking 
department of an intelligent home. 

Innumerable things are needed in the kitchen, and they 
should be good. Good tinware, good ironware, good 
woodenware, good stock and tools of all kinds are by far 
the cheapest in the long run. Get fewer articles at first, 
but get them good. Get, as opportunity offers, knives, forks, 
spoons, nut picks, steel, cheese scoop, cleaver, salad fork 
and spoon, coffee mill, ice chisel, nutmeg grater, coal sifter, 
strawberry huller, potato slicer, cabbage cutter, colander, 
broiling irons, etc., etc., over the broad range into which we 
simply peep in this chapter. 

Among things rarely used in kitchens, but very valuable, 
are cutting boards, made of hard wood and in various sizes, 
on which to cut bread, slice meat, chip dried beef, etc.; 
deep pans for frying in the French style, which submerges 
the articles in boiling fat ; a scale and weights, to test goods

purchased and to make accurate use of materials in cook- 
ing; a set of measures, for the same purpose; plain egg 
boilers, or patent ones which whistle, ring a bell, etc., when 
the egg is done; sandglasses of various sizes for noting 
time in the boiling of eggs, etc. ; an egg beater, of which 
the " Dover " is generally regarded as best ; coffee-pots in 
some of the scientific forms ; and so onward in another 
broad sweep. 

House-furnishing goods may be catalogued thus: Brass 
and copper ware ; cutlery and hardware ; agate and granite 
wares ; britannia ware ; planished or block tinware ; stamped 
tinware; japanned ware ; wood and willow ware; carved 
and fancy v/oodenware ; brushes, brooms, etc. ; wire goods ; 
papier-mache goods ; iron goods, and miscellaneous goods. 
Such is the classification of the great catalogue of F. A. 
Walker & Co., of Boston, which gives over a thousand 
illustrations of household utensils in forms and fashions the 
most diverse, and yet, as a rule, strikingly beautiful. In- 
deed, one who has not consulted the catalogues of extensive 
dealers can have no idea of the variety of goods offered. 

While commending the broad range of appliances which 
open before the housekeeper, it may be well, however, to 
quote a paragraph from Ella Rodman Church's bright book. 
How to Furnish a Home. She says: "Some kitchens 
are fitted up so luxuriously, with a perfect army of porce- 
lain-lined saucepans, folding gridirons, oyster-broilers, flesh- 
forks, larding- needles, perforated and grooved spoons, pie- 
crimpers, steamers, marble paste boards and rollers, egg- 
beaters, and all the thousand-and-one labor-saving contriv- 
ances, that their equipment is quite as expensive as that of 
other portions of the house. Much of this is unnecessary, 
especially to the young housekeeper ; and, where there is 
not a very full purse, it is better to provide only must-\v2.w&^ 
in the beginning, and leave would-\i2N^?> to be gathered by 
degrees."

Broilers. — There is great variety in the utensils emploved 
for broiling meats, fish, etc. The two cuts here given sh'ow 

the large, strong wire 
broiler suitable for the 
heaviest pieces, and 
the fine-wired, small 
sized broiler adapted 
for oysters and the 
most delicate of birds. 
The double construction of these 
broilers enables them to be turned 
over with ease, for the purpose of 
doing both sides to a nicety. At least 
two sizes of broilers are needed in 
every well-stocked kitchen, though 
more would be of use to meet the 
many and varied demands of the average American home. 
Small Cake Pans. — Pans for biscuits, cookeys, gems, pat- 
ties, muffins, etc., can be had in all styles, simple and orna- 
mental. We show the 
(i) Turk's Head Muffin 
Pan ; (2) the plain Bis- 
cuit Pan ; and (3) the 
plain Muffin Pan. But 
this showing by no means 
exhausts the variety. Al- 
most every form of the 
housewife's fancy can be 
met at the house-furnish- 
ing stores, so far as these 
incidentals to nice cook- 
ery are concerned. Every

Molds for Puddings, etc. — A plain pudding mold and 
fluted rice mold are shown in these cuts. They have the 

hot-water column 

at the centre to 

insure a complete 

cooking. Each has 

a tight-fitting lid, 

with loops for ty- 
ing the lid in position, and thus they form a complete utensil 
for the cooking of puddings, rice, etc. 

Asparagus Boiler. — Every cook knows the difficulty of 
removing boiled asparagus from the pot. 
Here is a utensil of proper size and shape, 
having a movable deck or shelf, on which 
the vegetable lies in cooking, and on which 
it is removed straight and whole when done. Similar 
boilers are arranged for fish. 

Strainers. — Aside from ordinary colanders for straining 
purposes, there are others adapted 
specially for soups, jellies, etc., 
one of which is here shown. The 
hook opposite the handle holds 
the cloth in case one is used in 
the process. 

Batter Pails.— In making batter cakes it is better to avoid 
dipping the batter, as this process 
cuts the air vesicles in it and 
promotes heaviness. To pour 
it neatly and expeditiously is 
better, and for this the batter 
pail, is adapted. The batter 
should be mixed in the pail 
and poured directly from it, so 
avoiding all unnecessary agitation and consequent injury.

Apple Parer. — So great is the consumption of apples in 
cookery that an apple parer is a domestic necessity. The 

one shown in the cut is 
known as the Bay State 
Apple Paring and Slic- 
ing Machine. It i-s quite 
justly regarded as the 
very best ever made_ 
The little machine is 
clamped by the thumb- 
screw to a table. It 
pares and slices the 
fruit, and deposits the 
slices in a dish. Its 
operation is quick, effective, certain, and simple. 

Can Opener. — One of the standing annoyances of house- 
keepers is the opening of cans containing fruits, vegetables, 

etc. It is certain 
that the ordinary 
tools employed for this purpose 
are very defective. They are 
hard to operate, dangerous to 
handle, and rough in results. 
The accompanying cut shows the 
Clipper Can Opener in position 
for service. It is screwed on to 
any convenient place. The table 
on which the can stands is ad- 
justed by a ratchet movement to any height of 
can. The knife is curved to meet the circle of 
the can. It can easily be thrust through the tin, 
when, by a rotary motion, it will cut the top out 
as cleanly as if cut by straight shears. This cut- 
ter is a specialty of the Cowles Hardware Co., of 
Unionville, Conn.

Molds.— For jellies and cakes these are supplied in 
abundant variety Fine cakes and jellies may be furnished 
in plain forms, but in 
the ornamental forms 
they are far prettier, 
and can be just as 
well cooked or cooled. 

Cake Pans. — A plain cake mold with hot-air tube in centre 
is here shown. Also the spring-bottom pan, which is taken 

off the cake, and not 
the cake out of it, 
thus avoiding " stick- 
ing," difficulty in 
"turning out," etc. 





Forks. — An assortment of large, strong forks is very 
desirable in a kitchen. They not only handle meats with 
ease and safety, but they save 
the hands from exposure to 
scalding steam, from which one 
cannot escape if ordinary forks 
are employed. 

Milk Boilers. — How hard it is to boil milk, or any of the 
milk preparations, without scorching, is well known by 






bitter experience in every household. By using a boiler 
like these shown here, with water in the lower vessel, all 



the danger is obviated.

Cherry Stoner. — In preserving cherries or making cherry 
pies, one of the most troublesome things is to get rid of the 

stones. The Family 
Cherry Stoner, here 
shown, does the work 
very well, preserving 
the plumpness of the 
cherry and saving all 
its juices, but effectu- 
ally removing its stone. 
There are other stoners 
in the market, but this

of the cherry s'irpasses 

them all. It is as nearly perfect as any machine can be. It 

seems endowed with intelligfence. 




Apple Corer and Slicer. — The contrivance here shown is 
the Climax Corer and Slicer, a fit companion for the ordi- 
nary apple parer. 
The pared apples 
are set upon this 
instrument, which 
also is clamped to 
a table, when by a 
slight movement 
they are cored and 
sliced, the slices 
falling into a pan 
and the core being held in position until removed by hand. 
How wonderful an advance this is over the old 
method of gouging out cores by means of ordinary 
knives need not be told. Nor need housewives be 
reminded of its superiority to the old style of 
apple-corer, which we show for the sake of contrast.

Paring Knife. — A good help in paring vegetables or fruits 
is shown in the cut here given. It consists simply of a 
guide attached to the 



blade of a knife, as hefe 
illustrated, by means of 
which a uniform thick- 
ness of paring is secured. 
The same attachment will secure uniformity in slicing. 

Fish Turner. — ^^How difficult it is to turn a fish without 
breaking it every cook knows. But trouble may be 
obviated by the use of such a 
tool as is here pictured. For 
many other uses, as a scraper of 
pie-boards, etc., it will be found 
very useful. Its blade is thin 
and full of spring, but not sharp 
at the edges. Those who have 
used this article prize it highly. 
It does good work and does it 




with great ease. 

Lemon Squeezer. — Everybody 
knows of this valuable kitchen 
utensil, but of the porcelain bowl 
and compress shown here all 
may not know. This arrange- 
ment is far superior to the ordi- 
nary wooden squeezer. The 
hinge is tinned to avoid rust, and 
is strong enough to safely bear 
all the pressure that may be 
needed to entirely extract the 
juices of the lemon. Such an 
article is far more economical 
than the old method of squeezing.

Bread Mixer and Kneader. — The Dutcher Temple Company, 
of Hopedale, Mass., has patented the Mixer and Kneader 

shown in the next cut, and 
f /^^^^^^^^ ^ known by the name of 

its inventor, Stanyan. It 
is claimed that this ma- 
chine saves time and 
labor; that it is easily 
operated, and that, too, by unskilled help ; that it saves 
touching the dough with the hands before baking, thereby 
insuring clean bread ; that it avoids the use of the molding- 
board and consequent addition of dry flour after raising ; 
and that it is equally well adapted to mixing fruit-cake, 
mince-meat, etc. 

These are high claims, certainly, but Miss Parloa, the 
accomplished instructress in cookery, speaks concerning it 
in the following laudatory terms : '' I find in it an article 
the want of which I have always felt. It cuts and beats up 
the dough at the same time, a process which gives you a 
fine, light bread." She also says, " No kitchen should be 
without it," and she certainly ought to know. 

Covers. — Who wants cold food when warm can be had ? 

Covers of all sizes and styles can be had whereby much of 

this evil is avoided. They are made 
from seven inches to twenty-four in 
length, at prices from fifty cents 
upward. The upper style will cover 
a beefsteak, a plate of chops, a fish, 
or any such articles which do not 
stand high upon the plate. The 
other style may be used for roasts. 
When ready to carve, they may be 
removed by the attendant, and the 

meats will be found steaming hot and very savory.

Nut Crack. — Why should people hammer their fingers 
cracking nuts when such a tool as that here shown can be 




had for a few dimes ? Half the delight of eating nuts is de- 
stroyed by the old style of cracking. By the new style the 
delight is doubled. 

Broom Holder.-^This is a neat and simple contrivance, cost- 
ing but a few cents, and yet capable of holding any broom 
as shown in the cut. It is 
screwed to any wood-work. The 
broom is suspended by simply 
slipping it in from the underside 
and withdrawing the hand. The 
pinch of the leverage holds it 
firmly. To remove the broom 
the end of the holder needs 
simply to be lifted. It does 
away with all necessity of boring 
the broom handles and inserting 
strings, also with the upending 
of brooms behind doors and in 
corners. For each broom in use 
in the home a holder should be 
procured. Then, having a place 
for each, see that each is kept in 
its place. Order, even in so small a matter, is Important.

Small Tins. — Tin muffin rings, biscuit cut- 

:B=-.-^^^^ ters, doug-hnut cutters, tart cutters, etc., can 

be had in endless variety and at very low 

ilii^j rates. Every kitchen should be well stocked 

'^ with them. 

Com Grate:. — The device here illustrated is known as 
Wood's Green-Corn Grater. It consists of a curved 





metal standard, provided with a thumb-screw, and termina- 
ting at the upper end in two parallel blades, one serrated, 
the other plain, as shown in upper part of the engraving. 

To operate this grater, clamp it firmly to a table or shelf, 
place the ear of corn across the parallel blades, at right 
angles, then push the ear or draw across the blades, the 
toothed blade first tearing open the kernels, and the plain

one pressing out the pulp perfectly, leaving the hulls on the 
cob. The bowl underneath catches the pulp, ready to pre- 
pare for the table. Made by the Cowles Hardware Co. 

Vegetable Slicer. — To neatly slice vegetables is quite an 
art. So inaccurate is the movement of an ordinary knife, 

and so tedious withal, 
that all sorts of inven- 
tions have been made 
to facilitate the pro- 
cess. All the pre- 
vious contrivances are 
surpassed, however, 




in the patented slicer shown in the cut. On this the Cowles 
Hardware Company have secured the exclusive right to use 
for a vegetable slicer a knife cutting with both edges, which 
produces a slice at every movement of the hand, enabling 
the cutter to perform double labor in a given time. Its 
simplicity of construction enables it to be sold at a very 
reasonable price. 

Clothes Sprinkler. — To sprinkle clothes evenly is desirable, 
when in preparation for the ironing process. The apparatus 
shown in the cut is simply a tin 
tube perforated with very fine 
holes and set upon a handle, 
which also acts as a stopper. 
Water may be placed in the tube, out of which it will not 
drip, but it may be shaken in a fine spray as needed.

Chafing Dishes. — These valuable aids to warm food can be 
had in sizes from ten inches to twenty-four and complete at 

prices from about tv/o dollars 
upward. The cuts show the 
chafing dish stand inclosing the 
lamps, the water-pan to secure 
evenness of heat, and the plate 
for containing the delicacy to be 
served. Covers, such as have 
been shown already, are suitable 
for chafing dishes. Tea urns, 
coffee-pots, soup tureens, etc., are con- 
structed on the same general methods. 
We give a sample of the soup tureen 
with lamp-stand attachment. The form 
needed for coffee-pots and tea-pots is 
familiar to all. An alcohol lamp makes 
the best heating attachment, as its flame 
is intense and free from smoke. Some 
of these heating arrangements will be prized in every home. 
Potato Parer. — A potato parer differs from an apple parer 
mainly in its capacity for a greater longitudinal and a freer 

vertical movement, to 
fit the different lengths 
and the many inequali- 
ties of the potatoes. 
The little machine here 
shown does all that is 
needed for potatoes, 
and does it rapidly, 
neatly, and economically. It is valuable for a larg e fam ily. 





XXII.— INCIDENTAL HELPS. 

NOTHING can go happily and healthfully in the home 
without pure water. No residence is complete without 
it. In promoting health and comfort it is unequaled. 
More disease and suffering are caused by the use of impure 
water than arise from any other one source. If the spores 
brought in the atmosphere from ponds and marshes poi- 
son us, how much more surely wi41 we be poisoned by 
drinking the water which produces them ? Few persons 
would dip a glass of water from a common pond and drink 
it because in that large body of water the impurities are 
visible to the eye, giving the water a clouded, muddy ap- 
pearance ; yet the same impurities are in the water when 
drawn in one's residence, but in the small quantity of water 
the eye does not detect them. A good filter removes all 
the clay, animal and vegetable matter, giving you clear, 
sparkling water. 

Filters. — Where the water does not flow, but is carried 
to the house, a device such as the Jewett Filters is needed, 
though there is the difficulty of cleaning , these, which is a 
serious drawback to their value. These filters combine 
with water-coolers also, so doubling their advantages. 

A cheap domestic filter may be made by taking a com- 
mon flower-pot, of large size, inserting a sponge in the hole 
at the bottom, and then filling the pot with alternate layers 
of sand, charcoal, and small pebbles. The pot, thus filled, 
may stand so as to drain into ajar or other convenient ves- 
sel. Practically this will answer all the purposes of a more 
elaborate and costly affair. 

Where running water is led to a house, filters may be

put on each faucet, and may so cleanse, in a measure, what 
flows through that outlet. But the body of filtering sub- 
stance contained in such an apparatus is small and the 
work is correspondingly defective. The most complete 
filtering apparatus is the Loomis Automatic Filter. 

This apparatus is connected with 
the water-supply pipe of the house 
and filters all the water used there. 
It varies in size according to the ca- 
pacity of the supply pipe. It will last 
as long as the iron pipes, there be- 
ing absolutely nothing about it to get 
out of order, or wear out in a lifetime. 
The filter is cleansed daily, by sim- 
ply shifting the lever seen in the cut. 
Any filter that cannot be cleansed 
daily poisons instead of purifying wa- 
ter after it has been used two days. 
As the matter arrested by a filter pu- 
trifies in two days, if it remain in the 
filter, the result is obvious. In the 
cut of this filter, I shows the inlet 
of the water from the regular supply 
pipe. The lever being as shown, the water passes into and 
through the two filtering chambers of the apparatus. Pass- 
ing out at the bottom, the water is served to the entire 
house by the outlet O. To cleanse the filtering substances, 
reverse the lever. This throws the water supply into the 
bottom and out into the waste-water pipe, by the outlet W. 
Five minutes per day of this flow will keep the filter 
sweet and pure indefinitely. 

Refrigerators. — Unless one has a very cold cellar, or 
a model spring house, a refrigerator is a necessity, that food 
may be kept safely in warm weather. There are refrig- 
erators with chemical action, which secure a temperature

able, being far too complex and expensive.

mestic uses. The patterns are many, and for each supe- 
riority is claimed. There are a few points to be observed m 
any such article ; for instance, the cleanliness of the lining. 
Wood, slate, and zinc have been employed usually, but

the preponderating sentiment accords superiority to the 
zinc, as capable of more thorough cleansing, and as least 
likely to hold grease, odor, or other unpleasantness. 

The walls of the refrige- 
rator should be packed with 
charcoal, or contain an in- 
closed air-chamber, as non- 
conductors of heat. In the 
body of the refrigerator, pro- 
vision must be made to per- 
mit free movement of the 
cold air from the ice, and yet 
the drippings from the ice- 
box must not reach the other 
parts. A convenient attach- 
ment to many refrigerators 
retains the melting from the 
ice, that it may be drawn for 
drinking purposes. It is ob- 
jected that this method con- 
sumes more ice, but it cer- 
tainly does more work, and 
avoids all trouble with the 
ordinary drainage from the 
ice-box. A purchaser should 
consider the several points 
presented here before decid- 
ing what choice to make. 

Ornamental forms are 
given to refrigerators when 
desired, so that they are suitable for even elegantly furnished 
dining-rooms, as is shown in the " Empress " on the pre- 
ceding page. This article combines all the modern con- 
veniences with the best external finish. The " Snow-flake " 
is another ornamental form, intended for use in the nursery.

It famishes cold water, while it preserves milk, fruit, etc., 
with ease. These are but samples of many other forms of 
cooling apparatus. 

Ice-cream Freezers. — A good ice-cream freezer is a valu- 
able accessory in any household. There are many such 
freezers, and Philadelphia has long enjoyed the distinction 
of being the centre of their manufacture. Packer's 
Standard Freezer, shown in the cuts below, is a good illus- 
tration of the completeness of these articles. They are

made in size from two quarts to forty quarts. The first 
cut shows the apparatus ready for use. The second shows 
it in sections, displaying the internal construction. The 
dasher or beater has a self-adjusting scraper, fitting closely 
to the inner surface of the can, which removes the frozen 
cream as rapidly as formed, while the deflectors direct 
the unfrozen portions to the sides of the can. By these 
appliances, the whole body of cream is constantly changing 
position and is most thoroughly beaten, insuring rapid and 
uniform freezing, and producing the most perfect smooth-

ness and richness with the largest amount of frozen cream 
that it is possible to make from the amount of pure cream 
used. The crank arrangement for turning this freezer and 
its internal machinery is a great labor-saver. It also does 
much more rapid work than can be done by hand-power 
alone. From fifteen to thirty minutes is the time usually 
required to freeze a can of cream, according to its size. No 
tools, however, can compensate for the absence of good 
ingredients. The best freezer cannot improve the quality of 
poor cream or of skimmed milk.

Household Management. 



NEXT to good domestic cooking stands good household 
management. It would be hard to say which Is en- 
titled to precedence. There are houses which are 
kept to a nicety, in which the cooking is execrable. There 
are others where good* cooking is the one thing that makes 
them endurable. But all good things should be happily 
combined If a really model home is sought. " I am no 
cook," said a newly established housekeeper, " but I am a 
good manager." If her capacity to manage extended to 
managing her cook, and her cook happened to be a good 
one, then things might move smoothly ; but for the best 
results the year through, housekeepers should be queens in 
every part of the home. 

Somebody manages the domestic affairs of almost every 
house. Occasionally it is the man of the house. Sometimes 
it is his mother, or his wife's mother. Oftener It Is the cook. 
There are homes where the rightful heads are not heads, but 
are more like tails. Another makes the decisions, and they 
wag assent, or submissively curl themselves up with ill- 
concealed disgust. There are some houses where there Is 
no management whatever. Affairs go as a log goes down 
stream. Now one end leads ; again the other. Now It goes 

301 



302 ^-^^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

broadside; again it does not go at all. Alas for those who 
dwell in such a house, and call it home! 

There are private as well as public resting places, where 
those who travel much occasionally stop, where wonderful 
contrasts are visible. One of these was a luxurious home in 
a Southern city. There was no stint because of straitened 
circumstances nor on the score of parsimony. The gentle- 
man and lady were wealthy, generous, and refined. Their 
cook had served long in a restaurant, and was fully compe- 
tent to do any culinary work. The meals were superb. 
They were cooked to a nicety and served to perfection. 
There was plenty, and that, too, of the best sort. 

But, oh ! the condition of the house ! The best guest- 
chamber was laden with odors so offensive that a chance 
lodger there began an exploration. Stowed in the bottorq 
of the clothes press of the room was accummulated rubbish, 
musty, moldy, mouse-infested, and disgusting. Having no 
means to correct the evil, the guest left this closet door wide 
open in the morning, hoping thereby to attract attention to 
its condition and secure its cleansing. But when he re- 
entered the room he found, to his dismay, that the door had 
been carefully closed upon its unsightliness and unwhole 
someness, the skeleton-maker, if not the " skeleton in the 
closet," being scrupulously retained. 

Such gross mismanagement is to be severely condemned. 
No excuse for it suffices. Common sense and common 
decency demand better management in every home. But 
the *^ happy-go-easy " inmates of that home saw nothing 
amiss. Of course, management may run to the other 
extreme. A house may be so orderly that a man instinct- 
ively gathers himself together when in it, lest he be caught 
in some of its machinery and be ground to powder ; or, 
what is equally to be dreaded, be the means of disarranging 
some part of that intricate family machine. 

A golden mean in management must be observed. 



HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT, $03 

Enough of it is necessary to compel complete and unceasing 
supervision at every point, so that everything shall be just 
as it should be. But when it becomes an overshadowing 
and awe-inspiring presence — subduing the laugh, suppress- 
ing the smile, restraining the steps, fettering the words — 
then it is a bane and not a blessing. 

Executive ability is in great part a natural endowment. 
Some are born to rule. Command is natural and easy for 
them. They can organize and execute. But the rarest 
genius in this art will be the better for practice. Experience 
will improve his natural aptitude. And he will gather valu- 
able lessons from the experiences of others. Where others 
fail he will shun to tread, unless the reason of their failure 
he so clearly sees that he is sure of mastery over it. What 
the person of ability sees in others and experiences in him- 
self is capital on which he trades, and from which he derives 
his revenues of advancement. 

If genuises in executive ability grow by what they learn, 
surely those less gifted need to learn the more, that they, 
too, may grow, though their advantages be less. Therefore 
it is that in this department of household management 
directions are given on many practical points of home duty. 
These directions are the results of experience. They may 
seem unimportant, and possibly excessive, but they will help 
the most competent, as well as the least competent, by sug- 
gesting both what to do and what not to do. The old 
maxim, " Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good," 
may well be sounded in the ears of all housekeepers. The 
best housekeepers have reached their proud eminence by 
this wise course. 

As housewives press on to higher and still higher attain- 
ments, let the words of one of the noblest of their company, 
Mrs. Sigourney, inspire them. She says : " The strength of 
a nation, especially of a republican nation, is in the intelli- 
gent and well-ordered homes of the people." 



I.— MARKETING. 

OPPORTUNITIES vary so in different localities, that 
general rules about marketing are hard to frame. In 
rural places the butcher drives to the door, and the 
customer must be content with what is found in the wagon. 
In villages and small cities, the butcher shops and stores, 
denominated ** Markets," afford a variety more or less 
excellent. Some of the large cities have their market stores, 
and green-grocers, and butcher shops, and great central 
markets, where qualities vary with the prices, and where 
customers of all grades and conditions can be supplied. 

In marketing, as in all other business transactions, it may 
be accepted as a rule, that goods will bring their value. The 
best usually costs most, and in the long run it is the cheapest. 
In such perishable goods as meats, fruits, fish, vegetables, 
etc., there are innumerable chances for fluctuations in price 
and for variation in quality. A judge of these commodities 
may " pick up bargains," but the inexpert and uninitiated 
are more frequently fleeced than favored in catch operations 
at the markets. 

General hints as to the selection of meats, fish, vegeta- 
bles, etc., have already been given in this volume, under the 
department of Cookery, but no hints, and no rules, will suf- 
fice absolutely. Keen and continuous observation, cfrowing- 
into a large and varied experience, are essential to a good 
marketer. There is not a family which has not suffered 
from a want of the knowledge that would enable them to 
judge the quality of meats offered them. Often at the 
market an expert is waited on from the best quality and the 
best cuts, while another, with less knowledge, is served from 

304

a poorer quality and less desirable cuts. Many a house- 
keeper has been censured for poor cooking, when the fault 
was back of that, and in the quality of the meats ; and 
again, the market man has often been censured for furnish- 
ing poor meats, when the fault was in the cooking. A good 
piece of meat may be spoiled in cooking and a poor piece 
may be made palatable. 

To know the parts of the animals sold in the markets, 
cind to understand their relative value and most economical 
uses, is the first requisite in successful marketing. Cutting 
of animals varies somewhat among butchers of different 
places, but the chart given below will fairly set forth the 
usual methods of cutting, and the ordinary designations oi 
the several portions. 




^'ss^ 



CHART ILLUSTRATING THE CUTTING OF BEEF. 



In explanation of the illustration of the cutting of beei 
the following notes will suffice : 

No. I. — The choice cut of the beef, i\vQ Sirloin, containing 
the kidneys and the tenderloin. These are the finest pieces 
of roasting and steak meat. 

No. 2. — ThQ Standing Rib piece, also a choice roastingpor- 
tion, which includes about eleven of the ribs. 



306 THE HO USE WIFE S LIBRAE V. 

No. 3. — The Chuck Rids, also used for roasting, but of a 
less desirable quality and usually sold at a lower price. 

No. 4.— The neck, with considerable bone, used generally 
for stewing and for pot roast. 

No. 5. — The C7teei% or jowl, a fleshy part, used for stew- 
ing or for boiling. 

No. 6. — The Rmn/f, sometimes cut differently from the 
manner shown in the diagram, which is the usual cutting at 
the East, for domestic purposes. This part has very litde 
bone and is generally used for choice steaks, and the por- 
tion next the tail, left from the steak cutting, is a choice 
piece for corning. 

No. 7. — The Pin-bone, a choice piece for roasting, being 
very tender. 

No. 8. — The Round, which furnishes common steaks, and 
is the choice cut for dried beef or for corning. 

No. 9. — The Leg, the choice soup piece. 

No. 10. — The Shin, also used for soup. 

No. 1 1. — The Thill flank, used for boiling and for corning. 

No. 12. — The Brisket, used for corning. 

No. 13. — The Plate, used for family boiling and for 
corning. 

No. 14. — The Plate (thick end), extending under the 
shoulder, used for corning and family boiling. 

No. 15. — The Breast, or butt end of the brisket, also 
called the ** sticking piece." Used for corning and soup' 
meat. 

If the cutting vary materially from this plan, it is still 
true that the essential parts of the animal continue to exist 
and are for sale under some name and in some shape. A 
polite inquiry of any reputable butcher will secure the 
desired information as to any part. By this means a person 
may secure intelligent skill in purchasing beef Some spe- 
cial points concerning beef need a moment's attention. 

The Tongue is used fresh, salted, or smoked. It is a very

desirable and delicate portion, suitable for table use at almost 
any time. The Tail, which affords some meat and much 
gelatinous substance, Is prized for soups, ox-tall soup espe- 
cially being founded upon It. The Heart and Liver are used 
for food — the former being stuffed and roasted, the latter 
being fried, usually with onions. The Tripe, which is the 
lining of the large, or receiving stomach of the beef, is used 
for souse, for pepper-pot, etc. It is a cheap article. The 
Kidneys of beef are sold separate from the sirloin, from 
which they are cut. They are used for stewing, etc. Suet, 
used for pie-crust, plum-puddings, mince-meat, etc., is the 
solid, clear fat, which Incloses the kidney. When pure it 
is a very desirable article. The Feet are used for jellies, 
though not so delicate as the calf's foot. The Head is refuse. 
The Marrow-bones are those of the shin, leg, and round. 
Any of the round, hollow bones contain marrow. The 
other remains of beef are refuse, except as available for 
manufacturing purposes. 

VEAL. 
Veal is a favorite meat. Consult the points concerning it 
made upon page j6. Veal is cut as shown below. 

No. I. — Loin, the best end. It is the favorite roasting 
piece, and furnishes the 
choice chops. It com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — Fillet, ox cw^ot 
piece. This too is a 
choice part, being excel- 
lent for steaks and for 
roasting and filling. It 
is also verv fine for a cold 
cut. 

No. 3. — The Leg, call- 
ed knuckle also, used chiefly for stewing and for soup. 
No. 4. — The Rack, used for chops, and for roasting ; less

desirable and lower priced than the loin, having more 
bone. 

No. 5. — The Neck, used for stewing, pies, etc. The best 
end is quite desirable, that nearer the head being of less 
value. 

No. 6. — Head. The brains and tongue are prized by many, 
the former for frying as a delicacy, the latter for boiling. 
The head, as a whole, is used in mock turtle and some other 
fancy soups. 

No. 7. — The Shoulder^ used for roasting, for which it 
answers a good purpose. It is valuable for a stew also. 

No. 8. — The B^'east. This is the second choice piece for 

stuffing and roasting. It is too valuable for pies, stews, etc. 

No. 9. — The Shin. This usually goes with the shoulder, 

with which it is often roasted. If used separately, it answers 

fairly well for stewing. 

The Sweetbread, a very delicate portion, belongs with the 
breast. It is often sold separately, however. The Kidneys 
are sold with the loin, in the fat of which they are imbedded. 
The Heart and Liver are great delicacies for frying, or the 
heart for stuffing and roasting. The Feet are the basis of 
genuine calves-foot jelly, and are much prized for this pur- 
pose. The Entrails, cut open and well cleaned, are made 
into souse by some persons. 

MUTTON. 
Next to beef, the most profitable and healthful meat is 
mutton. In all markets this meat is cut substantially in the 
same manner as shown in the following chart. The names 
and ordinary uses of the parts are as follows : 

No. I. — The Loin, best end. This is the choice piece for 
filling and roasting and for prime chops. Of course, it com- 
mands the best price. 

No. 2. — The Leg. This joint is nearly always used for 
roasting and chops, sometimes also for boiling. It has but 
little bone, as compared with the other parts of the animal,

and is, therefore, an economical piece to select, though the 
price per pound be greater than that of any other cut. It

It is customary to split mutton down the back, and then 
to split each half into parts called hind and fore quarters. 
The saddle is the middle portion before this quartering is 
done. Part of it goes with each quarter. 

The hind quarter of mutton, consisting , of the leg and 
the loin, is the choice quarter. It makes a very superior 
large roast, while either of its parts, the leg or the loin, suf- 
fices nicely for a small company. A hind quarter from an 
animal in good condition will weigh from twenty to thirty 
pounds. The Kidneys are used as in beef, so also the heart 
and liver. The other parts are refuse. 

LAMB. 
Lamb is cut as mutton, but it is usually dressed with 
more care, so as to present a more attractive appearance. 
Lamb proper is in market in the spring only. As the sea- 
son advances older lamb is in market, but what is called 
" lamb " in the winter months is usually poor mutton 
dressed lamb style. The butcher indulges in a quiet smile 
when his customer, in the winter season, asks for and pays 
for " lamb." Of course, the superiority and rarity of lamb 

demand for it the best 
prices. Indeed, "fancy 
prices " reign in lamb.

No. 5. — The Shoulder. A fair roasting piece, but chiefly 
used, like the ham, for pickling and curing, though it is 
greatly inferior to ham in juiciness and flavor. Either fresh 
or corned it is a fine boiling piece.

fresh, salted, or smoked. ' 

No. 9. — Feet. These are much used for souse and for 
pickling. They contain so much gelatinous matter that they 
are exceedingly desirable. 

The Ears also are used for souse and head cheese. The 
Liver, Heart, and Kidneys are used for liver pudding. The 
Entrails, nicely cleaned, are used for sausage skins. The Fat 
about the kidneys furnishes leaf lard. The other fat fur- 
nishes common lard. The other parts are refuse. 

VENISON. 

If the marketer desires venison, it is well to remember 
that buck venison is best from August ist to November ist; 
and that doe venison is best from the latter date to January 
1st, after which no deer should be killed. It is quite com- 
mon, however, to freeze deer meat, and to keep it for months 
in that state. This adds to the cost, but it also improves 
the fibre of the meat. 

Venison is cut into parts respectively designated haunch, 



3 1 2 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

saddle, leg, loin, fore-quarter, and steaks. The latter should 
not be cut until ready for use. Venison should be fat. It 
cannot be too fat. Its flavor is better after hanging a few 
days, but it should not become rank. To test this, pierce it 
with a skewer and notice the odor. Shun tough venison. 

For roasting, choose the haunch, the saddle, the neck, or 
the shoulder. Cut steaks from the leg. Stew the shoulder, 
or any part which is too thin for satisfactory roasting. . 

POULTRY. 
" Tests of poultry are given on page 6i. But the expe- 
dients resorted to in order to mislead purchasers are so 
numerous that even experts are not wholly safe. Techni- 
cally, the term cJiickens belongs to fowls under a year old, 
but actually, the entire tribe is included in the name. Capons 
are young roosters, gelded and carefully fed so as to secure 
the utmost delicacy of flesh. Pullets are young hens. 

Turkeys reach their maturity in eight or nine months, 
and hence young, but well-grown turkeys, are in market 
about the fall and winter holidays. Young hen turkeys are 
regarded as best, being fatter and more juicy ; but the male 
turkeys will be larger for the same age. The legs of young 
turkeys are black ; of old ones reddish and rough. Young 
cocks have small spurs; old ones large spurs and very 
rough legs. Fat turkeys, with broad, full breasts, are pre- 
ferable. Soft, pliable feet indicate fresh-killed birds. 

Wild turkeys are deemed to be finer in flavor than tame 
ones. They are in season in November, December, and 
January. They are usually sold with their feathers on. 
Small birds have their well-defined seasons, as have other 
kinds of game, but they admit little choice except as fresh. 

VEGETABLES. 

Every good marketer will supply his table with a variety 
of vegetables all the year round. There is hardly a vege- 
table that cannot be had in our markets at any season, 
either fresh or canned. Railroads and steamers connect the 



MARKETING. 313 

different climates so closely that one hardly knows whether 
he is eating fruits and vegetables in or out of their natural 
season. But it takes a long purse to buy fresh vegetables 
at the North while the ground is yet frozen. Still, there are 
so many vegetables that keep through cold weather that if 
we did not have new ones from the South, there would be, 
nevertheless, a variety from which to choose. Late in the 
spring, when the old vegetables begin to shrink and grow 
rank, we gready appreciate what comes from the South. 

If one has a good, dry cellar, it is wise to procure in the 
fall vegetables enough for all winter. But if the cellar is 
warm, vegetables will sprout and decay before half the cold 
months have passed. Those best adapted for winter keep- 
ing are onions, squashes, turnips, beets, carrots, parsnips, 
cabbages, and potatoes. Squashes and onions should be 
kept in a very dry room. The others will keep readily in a 
cool, dry cellar, or bedded in sand beneath the reach of frost. 

If vegetables be bought as needed, care must be used to 
get them in good condition. In season, they should never 
appear wilted, but should be fresh and crisp. At no time 
should they be used if suffering from decay. The utmost 
prudence is needed at this point. A very little waste will 
more than counterbalance all you save by purchasing large 
quantities, and by storing for the winter. 

The luxuries of the world are spread at the feet of the 
customer in our markets ; still, extravagant expenditure is 
by no means necessary. Many delicacies are within the 
reach of all. Those who content themselves with sending to 
the markets, miss many golden opportunities. Those who go, 
see for themselves, and embrace many a favoring chance. 
Personal observation ripens into experience also, and the 
experienced purchasers command the situation. 

These remarks apply with equal force to purchasing of 
the grocer, the baker, the milkman, and all, in short, who 
supply us with the necessaries of life. There are reliable 



314 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

dealers and those of doubtful integrity; but in every case 
the hope of the household is in its provider. Cultivate 
power in this line. 

It is best to deal steadily with persons whom you have 
tried and found reliable. Do not relinquish your indepen- 
dence, so as to suggest to them the idea that they may im- 
pose on you. Be ready to go elsewhere, if the old service 
falls off; but usually those who are regular dealers at a 
place get the best attention, and errors or failures can be 
rectified with ease. 

In all marketing and dealing with storekeepers keep your 
temper. To lose one's temper and scold or threaten, is un- 
dignified and worse than useless. State your grievances 
calmly and plainly. If they are redressed, all right ; if not 
redressed, you can quietly go elsewhere and bestow your 
patronage. A little suspension of trade with a dealer often 
works wonders. He does not want to lose customers ; but 
such is the waywardness of human nature, that all of us 
need reminders to keep us fully up to duty. Let the dealer 
have these when he needs them, but never at the expense 
of your own self-possession and courteous dignity. 



II.— CARVING. 

THE ART OF CARVING j REQUISITES ; CARVING TURKEY, CHICKEN, 
DUCKS, GEESE, SMALL BIRDS, BEEF, MUTTON, LAMB, VENISON, 
HAM, PIG, RABBIT, STEAKS, FISH, TONGUE, AND CALF's-HEAD. 

EVERY person who travels or visits much sees number- 
less illustrations of the varied capacities of carvers. 
Hotel and restaurant life does not make much display- 
in this line, as the carving is done out of sight. And yet 
even here the marvelous thinness of the slice, which is so 
immense in its area, demonstrates that somebody is on hand 
who is expert in this line. In private houses the meat and 
the poultry are sometimes carved before they come to the 
table. By whom done, or with what accompaniments of per- 
spiration and emphatic words, the guests know not. But 
^meat served thus is chilled and juiceless, and generally dam- 
aged. It is worthy of better treatment. 

Many amusing and not a few irritating examples of 
clumsy carving occur under everybody's eyes. Meat is con- 
demned as tough, knives as dull, dishes as too small, there 
is too much gravy, skewers are not drawn, and a thousand 
other reasons are blurted out by the clumsy carver, as he 
outwardly sweats and inwardly swears at his task. He slops 
gravy on to the cloth ; he drops part of the meat from the 
dish ; he cuts himself by an unfortunate slip of the knife ; 
and sometimes, like a distinguished v/it of whom the story 
tells, he lands a fowl in the lap of a lady beside him, 
though probably, unlike that wit, he will not have the grace 
to say, " I will thank you, madam, to return that chicken." 

Every housekeeper should learn to carve. Carving should 
be done at the table by the gentleman of the house, or, in his 

315 



316 THE HO USE WIFK S L IBRA R Y. 

absence, by the lady, unless some other of the family be an 
expert carver. Unless a guest is known to be an expert, or 
unless he volunteers for the duty, he should not be expected 
to carve. He may be a clumsy hand, and the courtesy of 
hospitality should protect him from exposure at this point. 

The carver at a private table should retain his seat while 
carving and serving. To facilitate this, his chair should be 
high, so that he can reach readily to his work. The dish 
should be large enough to prevent soiling the cloth, except 
by some unusual accident. The centre of a carving-dish for 
roast meats should be raised nearly as high as the surround- 
ing edge, so that a horizontal movement of the knife in slicing 
may be made without interference from the edges. No man 
can slice meat neatly if the meat is in the bottom of a deep 
dish, into which he must scoop with his knife as best he 
may. Elevate the meat, but have a surrounding depression 
between the centre and the edge, where the rich juices of the 
meat may accumulate, and where they may be served readily. 

Not all knives are suitable for carving, nor is any one knife 
just the thing for all work in this line. For slicing, a long, 
thin, broad blade is essential. With a fine roast, elevated on 
the dish, and with a good, sharp slicing knife in hand, a 
cool-headed man can hardly help doing neat and rapid work. 

But such a knife is not the one for poultry or rib carving. 
For these uses a shorter blade, which is both narrower and 
stiffer, must be employed. All knives for carving must be 
sharp. There should be a good steel at hand to touch up 
the edge — nothing more, for a dull knife should be ground, 
or whet up on an oil-stone. Any large ' fork, with a guard 
to prevent accidents, will do. A rest for the knife and fork 
when not in use is desirable. The carver's requisites, there- 
fore, are as follows : A high chair, suitable serving plates, 
two sharp knives, a good fork,, and a knife and fork rest. 
With these he is ready for work. Without them he is at 
serious disadvantage. 




CARVING, 317 

Carving a Turkey. — Nothing delights an expert carver 
more than the opportunity to cut up a fine roast turkey. 
Such a man is in doubt whether the eating of the meat even 
is the greater luxury. 

Whether the head of the bird shall lie to the carver's 
right or left is an open question. Better to the right, as 
more work is required on the head end, and in this position 
the knife-hand works less over the hand which holds the 
fork. 

The fork should be inserted astride of the breast-bone, 
just back of its most promi- 
nent point. It should be 
sunk deep enough to pene- 
trate the encasing bone be- 
low the white meat. This 
secures full command of the 

bird. If the company be turkey properly trussed for 
small and the bird fairly roasting. 

large, better do all the cutting from one side, reserving the 
other in as perfect a form as possible. 

Remove all the limbs first unless half the bird is to be 
reserved. The neat cut is to remove each drum-stick, or 
lower leg, by a single stroke of the knife, which must ex- 
actly hit the joint. To remove the thigh, or upper leg 
joint, make a V-shaped cut, wide enough at the point whence 
the drum-stick has been cut to include all the meat, but 
converging at the joint, which can always be distinctly seen 
near the back. Two strokes of the knife do this work, each 
of them cutting down to the carcase. A slight outward 
pressure of the knife-blade, applied between the carcase and 
the upper point of the thigh joint, will cause it to drop 
off neatly on the plate. Outside the lines of these cuts, flakes 
of dark meat will remain adhering to the carcase, which 
should now be cut off. They help to meet demands for 
dark meat. 



318 THE HO USE WIFE'S L IB EAR V. 

In carving the wings, the neat stroke removes the lower 
part, which contains the two bones, by cutting at the inner 
part of the joint, and so turning the blade of the knife as 
to throw that part off in the direction opposite to its natural 
movement. The first joint of each wing then follows, the 
cut being deep enough to fully reach the ball and socket 
joint. A slight motion of the pinion toward the head of the 
bird will suffice usually to detach this part. If it does not, 
the point of the knife may be thrust into the socket of the 
joint to sever the cartilage. This will free it. 

When this dismembering is accomplished, proceed to 
slice the breast meat in thin, broad slices. Clean off all the 
white meat, unless part only is needed. Placing your knife 
close to the front of the breast-bone, and cutting toward the 
neck, you will dislodge the V-shaped bone, corresponding 
to the " merrythought " or " pull-bone " of chickens. To 
dislodge the collar-bones is to many a hard task. But cut 
the cartilages which bind them to the frame of the bird. 
These cartilages are in the cavity between the neck and the 
breast-bone. Through this cavity, thrust your knife out- 
wardly under one of these bones ; make a fulcrum of the 
front part of breast-bone, and a lever of the knife, its edge 
resting on the fulcrum. You can then easily pry up the 
troublesome bone and turn it off to the side. This move- 
ment takes the bone at the best mechanical advantage. It 
must come, and come at once, if this movement be made. 

Now attend to the other end of the bird. Shave off all 
superfluous meat from the carcase. Turn the carcase on its 
side, the back toward you. Insert your knife beside the oil- 
bag and thrust it forward parallel to the spine. It will cut 
its way very easily. A slight outward movement of the 
knife will then throw off these side bones, which are choice 
pieces, yielding the juiciest of the dark meat. The ribs 
may now be cut through with ease from front to rear, about 
midway from breast to back. The breast-bone is incapable 




CARVING. 33^9 

of further division, but the back easily divides into six parts. 
Turn it back up and hold with the fork ; separate the oil- 
bag, about an inch of the spine with it ; lift the 
projecting spine with the knife back and it will 
break readily, carrying one rib with it. Cut off 
from each side of the remaining spine the rib 
parts adherent to it; then divide the remaining 
spine just back of the neck. 

An entire drum-stick, or second joint, need not 
be served to any one person, but had better be 
divided among several. A fair-sized turkey 
divided on the above method will furnish a good ^ ^_ .

It will be asked, however, how can one become '■''' ^' '!"^ f

so expert in hitting these joints? Frequently age. a,c,e, 
the carver tries, and tries again, but tries in vain, ^^^^^ of sJpa- 
to strike the right place for his knife. There is rationofside- 
one way only to succeed in this art. The anatomy 3 ^^^ j.';b p'or- 
of the turkey or chicken, or any other animal, must *'°''- 
be carefully studied. Do it in this way. Whenever a tur- 
key is brought into your house and is made ready for the 
roasting, place it on its back, as it will lie on the plate when 
it comes to the table. Carefully manipulate it, and note 
exa-ctly where every joint lies. Imagine yourself about to 
carve it. Where would you put the knife to throw off that 
drum-stick ? How would you cut to throw off the thigh 
bone. Read the preceding directions ; apply them in fancy 
to the bird as you see and handle it ; then carry it all out at 
the table when the bird is cooked. 

No surgeon could do his work except he had thus prac- 
ticed on actual subjects in dissection. He must know by 
actual trial just what to do and how to do it. So must the 
carver know. Chickens, ducks, geese, small birds, meat, 
roasting pigs, every article, in short, which he expects to carve 
must be understood beforehand; then success will be his.

Carving Roast Chicken. — The same course precisely as has 
been prescribed for carving turkey must 
be followed with chickens. The only 
difference is in the formation of the 
" pull-bone " or ** merrythought," but 
this makes no difference whatever in the 
cutting of the bird. 



Carving Roast Ducks and Geese. — These 
are more difficult than turkey or chick- 
ens, for the reason that they are constitu- 
tionally more sinewy in the joints and 
they have far less flesh proportionately.

They are barrel-shaped, 
with thin layers of meat 
instead of the fine 
masses of flesh found 
on the turkey or on fine 
chickens. The leg joints 
lie farther to the rear, 
and higher on the side 
than in land fowls. They are not so easily reached, therefore. 
Their anatomy must be 
studied, however. It is the 
only way to obtain com- 
mand of the carcase. In 
carving, dismember the 
bird as in other cases.

other dishes, and so to be served lightly. Goose is some- 
times the main piece, but not often so at elaborate feasts. 

Camng Broiled GMckens. — Chickens for broiling are pre- 
sumably young and tender. If not, thorough steaming before 
they are broiled will do something for them. They are 
trussed in such shape usually that joints are not easily 
struck. But study the bird when trussed. See where joints 
do. lie and cut them. If the birds are really young and ten- 
der, however, they may be halved or quartered, cutting 
through the bones directly and so serving them. 

Carving Smaller Birds. — Smaller 
birds which need carving, may 
simply be split longitudinally, just 
beside the breast-bone and the 
spine. Their bones can be cut 
easily. This will apply to pigeon, 
partridge, prairie hen, pheasant, smaller bird properly

etc. 

Carving Roast Beef. — Pieces of roast beef vary so that no 
one rule covers all. A safe general direction, however, is 
to study carefully just what is in the piece before it is 
cooked. Know your meat before you attempt to carve it. 
Another general rule, applicable to all meats indeed, is to 
cut across the grain in all cases. Meat cut with the grain 
is stringy and fibrous. If cut across the grain, all the longi- 
tudinal flakes of flesh and the minute sinews are cut so 
short that any toughness existing in them is wholly con- 
cealed. The first slice, by this process, will always be a 
brown, outside cut. Slices should always be thin, bui not 
so as to seem ragged. In carving ribs of beef the knife 
may be thrust along close to the ribs, so as to separate the 
meat from them. The. cuts then made across the grain will 
separate the slices with ease and neatness. Never cut beef 
across the bone. It is the easiest way, but also the poorest. 



322 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



Carviiig Roasts of Mutton. — A leg of mutton is carved as a 
ham, by cutting down to the bone, from the outer edge, 
making the cuts converge on the bone, so freeing each sHce 
as it is cut. 

A shoulder of mutton should be carved as the leg. In 
each case, when the choice cuts are exhausted, clip off the 
remaining meat as best you can, always across the grain. 

Saddle of mutton is carved in several ways: ist, in longi- 
tudinal slices along the backbone ; 2d, by transverse slices, 
each taking in a rib, which makes thick and clumsy por- 
tions ; 3d, by oblique slices, not taking in the bones, but 
forming a slight angle with them. The latter method is 
deemed preferable by most carvers. 

In all roasts which include the ribs the backbone should 

be well and cleanly cut through by the butcher, between every 

pair of ribs. Otherwise no satisfactory carving can be done. 

Carving Roasts of Lamb. — The cut shows a fore-quarter of 

lamb with its outer side uppermost. This joint is first to 

be cut so as to divide the 
shoulder from the rest of 
the quarter, which is called 
the target. For this pur- 
pose, put the fork firmly 
into the shoulder joint, and 
then cut underneath the 
blade-bone, beginning at a, 
FORi^QUARTER OF LAMB. ^^^ continue Cutting all 

around in the direction of the circular line, and pretty close 
to the under part of the blade-bone. Some cut the shoulder 
larsre. while others take off no more meat with it than is 
barely necessary to remove the blade-bone. It is most con- 
venient to place the shoulder on a separate dish. This is 
carved in the same way as the shoulder of mutton. When 
the shoulder is removed, a lemon may be squeezed over 
that part of the remainder of the joint where the knife has 




CARVING. 323 

passed ; this gives a flavor to the meat which is generally 
approved. Then proceed to cut completely through from 
b to c^ following the line across the bones as cracked by the 
butcher, and this will divide the ribs ((T) from the brisket (e). 
Tastes vary in giving preference to the ribs or the brisket. 

Other parts of lamb are carved as mutton. The fat is 
very delicate and should be served to all the guests. 

Carving Roasts of Venison. — These resemble roasts of 
mutton so closely that no different directions for their carv- 
ing need be given. 

Carving Ham. — Boiled or baked ham may be served either 
side up. The inner edge of the ham, which lay adjacent to 
the body, is rather more tender than the edge, which lay 
toward the tail. Slices should be cut directly from the edge 
to the bone, cutting out the middle portions first. Let the 
cuts converge upon the bone every time, so that each slice 
is set free at once. When the choice cuts are gone, trim up 
the remaining parts neatly as possible, and always across 
the grain. The knuckle end of a ham furnishes the leaner 
and drier cuts. Some prefer carving hams with a more 
slanting cut, rather than a direct, right-angled cut upon the 
bone, beginning at the thick end, and so continuing through- 
out. This mode is, however, apt to be very wasteful, unless 
the carver be careful to take away both fat and lean in due 
proportion. 

Carving Roast Pig. — The cut below represents a pig roasted 
whole and served in the most 
approved style. Many, how- 
ever, separate the head before 
serving, and garnish the body 
with the ears, jaw, etc. The 
head may be severed by a ^^^^^ ^^^^'^ ^ ^^• 

neat cut around the neck, and a little sideward motion, but 
this is not necessary, as the cheek or jaw can be removed 
21 




324 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



without removing the head. The shoulder should then be 
taken off from the body, by passing the knife under it in a 
circular direction, and the leg separated as shown in the 
line d, e,f. The ribs may then be divided into two or more 
parts, helping at the same time an ear or jaw with it, with 
some of the sauce also. Pieces may be cut from the legs 
and shoulders. Some consider the neck end the finest part, 
while others give the ribs the preference. 

Carviiig Roast Rabbit— Begin by cutting longitudinally 
from head to tail near to the backbone, then make a corres- 
ponding cut on the other side of the backbone, leaving the 
back and the head in one distinct piece. Cut off the legs 
at the hip-joint, and take off the wing, or fore leg, nearly as 
you would the wing of a bird, carrying the knife round in a 

circular line. The ribs 
are of little importance, 
as they are bare of meat. 
Divide the back into 
three or four equal por- 
tions. The head is then 
to be cut off, and the 
lower jaw divided from

the upper part of the 
head in the middle, you have the brains, which are prized 
by epicures. The comparative goodness of different parts 
of a rabbit will depend much on the age, and also upon 
the cooking. The back and the legs are always the best 
parts. 

Carving Steaks, etc. — Where there is a tenderloin in a 
beefsteak, it should be divided among the party with the 
other portion. If there are too many persons to allow each 
a share, give ladies and guests the preference. Epicures eat 
the tenderloin at the last. As a bright boy said, " You 




CARVING. 325 

ought always to eat the best last ; then you feel as if you 
have had all best." 

Carving Fish. — This is more a serving than a carving. 
The meat of fish is usually so tender that cutting is unne- 
cessary. Skillful separation of the flakes is what is needed. 

A silver knife, or fish slice, and a silver fish fork, broad 
at the tines, are desirable. Steel tools impart a disagreeable 
odor to fish. Fish should be served in neat, unbroken por- 
tions, never in scraps and bits. 

In many kinds of fish the backbone may be 'taken out 
entire, as in all the mackerel family as served for the table. 
This is a neat proceeding for company ; but for home uses 
the backbone is preferred with the fish, because of the 
very savory morsels which adhere to it. ^ 

The skin and fins of the turbot are regarded as very deli- 
cate. It, therefore, should be split along the backbone, at 
its side, and then cut into cross sections so that part of a fin 
shall go with each portion. This is the neatest method of 
serving. 

Carving Tongue. — The juicy and fatter part of the tongue 
is at its thick end or root. Some prefer the smaller and 
drier end, however. If the whole tongue is not likely to be 
needed, cut off its tip in one piece, and on the main portion 
work backward toward the butt end. Do not cut squarely 
across, as it leaves the slices unduly small ; but cut on an 
angle, so doubling the area of the slices. 

Carving a Calfs Head. — Cut the external meat in strips 
from the nose to the back of the head. Some deem the eye 
a delicacy. It may be removed with the point of the knife, if 
requested, but do not puncture it with the fork or the knife. 
The palate is a choice part. It may be cut from under the 
head, with its surrounding parts, all of which are delicate 
morsels. The jawbone may be removed also, and will dis- 
close fine meat.

methods of serving meals j russian, english, french, and 
american styles; tables, table-cloths, napkins, and 
decorations ; finger-bowls ; due ceremony j what to 
avoid; garnishes; royal displays. 

METHODS of serving meals differ widely. The items 
of conveniences and pecuniary ability always become 
important elements in the case. Taste, too, enters 
largely into it. Some people need the formal and the cere- 
monious. Others despise these and prefer the free-and-easy 
plan. There are national methods also, which largely rule 
among the refined and elegant. 

One of these methods, the Russian, decorates the centre 
of the table elaborately with flowers, and surrounds it at the 
outset with the dessert tastefully displayed. This secures a 
delightsome central object. The several dishes are then 
brought to the table carved and ready for use, each dish 
being served as a separate course, one vegetable only being 
allowed to appear with it. 

The English method sets the whole of each course at 
once, no matter how many dishes it may contain. This, it 
is objected, allows the dishes to cool, and one often vitiates 
another. The dishes which require carving are by this 
method first placed on the table, and then removed to a 
side table for cutting and serving. 

The French method serves everything as a separate 
course, even each vegetable, unless it be simply a garnish 
for another dish. The American plan, however, serves at 
least one vegetable with each substantial dish. At the 
more formal meals among us, carving is done at the side 
tables, but in the genuine home dinners the work is done at 

326 



SERVING MEALS. 327 

the table by the host himself. If, however, he cannot do 
the honors of the serving with ease, let the work be done 
by another, at the side table. 

When the general plan of the dinner management is set- 
tled, those who are to do the various parts of the work 
must be thoroughly instructed. A servant not sufficiently 
intelligent to learn the required part well, and to do it pro- 
perly, is too stupid for satisfactory service with company or 
at a purely family gathering. 

Square end tables are now the proper style. They should 
be sufficiently roomy to wholly avoid crowding. A spot- 
lessly white table-cloth should be spread, with another 
under it to deaden sound and make a softer appearance. 
The cloth should not be very stiffly starched, but it should 
be nicely polished and beautifully glossy. It should hang 
two feet from the top edge, the corners gathered up, if needs 
be, to prevent their drooping on the floor. Napkins should 
be large and heavy. Such texture does not need much 
starch. The glass and silverware should be perfect in 
brightness. It may be of inexpensive kind, but it must be 
scrupulously clean. 

Colored table-cloths of ornamental patterns are allowable 
for luncheon or tea. They are not in place where hot meats 
are served. Nor are colored napkins. Too often these 
deep tinted articles are used "to save washing," which 
means " to conceal dirt." Not unfrequently covers and nap- 
kins of this kind are kept in use when their rank odor cries 
out for the wash-tub, even though their soiled appearance 
does not. The doily, or DOiley, as some will have it from 
the proper name of its first reputed maker, is a small, colored 
napkin used with fruits and wines. Stains will not show so 
readily upon these, but they must always be scrupulously 
fresh and clean. To conceal filth under rich coloring is 
sacrilege of the worst sort, but to bring it to the table, and 
ask guests to wipe their lips with it, is a crime. 



328 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

A great variety of ornaments and adornments are admis- 
sible on a table, but nothing is so pure and so appropriate 
as a handsome display of ferns or flowers. The flowers 
should not be just such as ladies wear so profusely and so 
beautifully in their belts and on their dresses. Larger blooms 
are preferable for the table, especially those of the pure white 
and fine texture belonging to the lily family. 

It is quite the proper and beautiful thing to place a neat 
bouquet beside each plate, in tasteful bouquet-holders. For 
gentlemen the little bunching suitable for the button-hole is 
desirable. For ladies the belt bouquet will meet the case. 
The floral centre-piece may be composed of small bouquets, 
which at the end of the meal may be distributed. 

Fruit pieces and handsome confectionery pieces may be 
disposed to advantage in ornamenting the table. Tasty 
folding of spotless napkins is so important a decoration that 
the subject will be treated fully farther on. These may be 
perched in polished goblets, while bouquets, or small rolls 
of bread nestle amid their snowy folds. Little arts like 
these embellish a table, and delight the guests. 

But these embellishments must not be overdone. What 
will be correct for a large table will be too much for a small 
one, and what will be just right for a small table will look 
thin and meagre on a large one. Study the proprieties of 
every occasion. What suits once does not suit forever. 

Embellishments may be liberally bestowed upon the din- 
ing-room itself In addition to its permanent decorations, 
flowers are always admissible. At the great ball on March 
20th, 1883, at the Vanderbilt Mansion in New York, the 
decorations of the supper-room were absolutely regal. The 
walls were completely hidden with palms and ferns, from 
which a countless number of orchids were suspended. Two 
large fountains were introduced into the far corners of the 
room. The doors of the main entrance to the supper-room 
were in an open position and were completely covered with 



SERVING MEALS. 329 

roses and lilies of the valley. In the centre of the room a 
large palm towered almost to the ceiling, and about it from 
the dome was suspended an immense Bougen Villa vine, the 
tendrils of which drooped in bunches from the branches of 
the palm. Throughout the room there were many stands 
and vases filled with flowers, the entire effect more 
resembling fairyland than an earthly home. Few can rival 
such a display, of course, but all enjoy at least a pen-peep 
upon such princely splendor. 

No ornament should be so large as to obscure to any 
great extent a view of the entire table, or to conceal any of 
its guests. As many knives, forks, and spoons as will be 
needed for the various courses may be placed at each plate, 
though, to avoid the display of so much cutlery, a better 
style is to supply these accessories as needed. Goblets and 
wine-glasses, if the latter be used, should be on the table at 
the start. Large spoons, with salt and ■ pepper casters, 
should be on the table also. The dessert-plates, finger- 
bowls, etc., should stand ready on the sideboard, awaiting 
the time when they shall be needed. The hot closet should 
be well stocked with dishes needing to be used warm. 

Finger-bowls should be half filled with water. In Paris they 
are served with warm water scented with peppermint. A 
slice of lemon in cold water answers the purpose entirely, as 
it removes any grease from fingers or lips. A geranium 
leaf may float in the water. Its fragrance on the fingers, if 
it be pressed, will be agreeable. It is customary to place a 
fruit napkin, or doily, on the dish on which the finger-bowl 
rests, to avoid the rattle of the bowl, and to protect the dish 
from injury if it be highly ornamented. Little openworked 
mats will, however, answer better. Do not summon your 
company to dinner by a bell. Country hotels and cheap 
boarding-houses may do that, but not a refined home, espe- 
cially when guests are present. 

Soup is dished by the lady of the house at a home dinner. 



330 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Meat is cut and dished by the gentleman of the house. 
Vegetables, bread, butter, water, etc., are served by the 
waiter, dessert by the hostess, except in the case of melons, 
requiring to be cut at the table, which is the work of the 
host. 

Home meals should all be sufficiently ceremonious to 
dispense with haste and confusion. On the other hand, they 
should not run into stiffness and frigidity. Bright, cheery, 
pleasant chat should enliven every meal. If the leading dish 
be nothing but hash, let it be served in good style and amid 
a profusion of genial, social sunshine. 

What to Avoid. 

1st. — Never use table-linen which is open to the suspicion 
of being soiled. The napkin-ring business is of question- 
able propriety. Why not, as at hotels, furnish a clean nap- 
kin to each person at every meal ? 

2d. — Crockery with an abundance of nicks and splints 
and cracks is not unsightly merely, but, where the glazing 
is broken, the porous material absorbs grease and dish water, 
making these spots dense with unsavory and unwholesome 
matter. 

3d. — Partly emptied dishes become unsightly, and some- 
times positively repulsive. They look like refuse and scraps. 
At the great State dinners at the Tuileries, no guest saw a 
partly emptied dish. A full, beautifully garnished dish was 
presented for his approval, upon expressing which, his per- 
sonal plate was taken to a side table and supplied from 
another serving dish. 

4th. — An overloaded table or plate satiates appetite 
rather than stimulates it. A gracious expectancy of what 
is to come is a great help at the table. 

5th. — A stinted supply is very discouraging. To the ap- 
prehension of a lack of food, the moral sense of mortification 
is added in this case. 



SERVING MEALS. 33 2^ 

6th. — Beware of ill-assorted dinners or tea-parties. An 
occasion intended to be a pleasure is often a pest for lack of 
care in this regard. This caution applies to the selection of 
guests, and more strongly to the disposition of guests at the 
table. Secure fitness both in the viands presented and in 
the parties present. 

7th. — Do not inaugurate new features at a dinner party, 
unless you are sure you have the mastery of them, and that 
when done in a masterly way they will certainly prove 
agreeable. 

8th. — Beware of the delusion that hospitality is expressed 
by the weight of its beef and mutton, and the multitude and 
rarity of its viands. 

9th. — Have no meddlesome, noisy, or slovenly service. 
Waiters should be attired neatly, and should wear light 
shoes or slippers. They should take no part in the social 
proceedings, not so much, indeed, as to smile at the best 
things. On formal occasions the man-servant should wear 
a dress-coat, white vest, and white necktie. The maid- 
servant should be attired in a neat, inconspicuous dress, 
with spotless white apron. 

1 0th. — Both haste and slowness should be shunned. At 
the finished French dinners, the courses will not average 
more than five minutes each. French waiters are marvel- 
ously expert, however, in removing and replacing dishes. 

Garnishes. 

Much of the attractiveness of a table depends on the 
garnishes, which are added to certain dishes to embellish or 
beautify them. A few hints on this subject will be of value. 

Parsley is the almost universal garnish to all kinds of 
cold meat, poultry, fish, butter, cheese, etc. 

Horse-radish is the garnish for roast beef, and for fish in 
general ; for the latter, slices of lemon are sometimes laid 
alternately with heaps of horse-radish. 



332 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Slices of lemon for boiled fowl, turkey, and fish, and for 
•roast veal and calf's head. 

Carrot in slices for boiled beef, hot or cold. They may 
be cut into ornamental forms if .desired. 

Barberries, fresh or preserved, for game. 

Fried smelts for turbot. 

Red beet-root sliced for cold meat, boiled beef, and salt 
fish. 

Fried sausages or force-meat balls for roast turkey, capon, 
or fowl. 

Fennel for mackerel and salmon, whether fresh or pickled. 

Lobster coral and parsley for boiled fish. 

Currant jelly for game, also for custard or bread-pud- 
ding. 

Seville oranges in slices for wild ducks, widgeons, teal, 
and such game. 

Mint, either with or without parsley, for roast lamb, 
whether hot or cold. 

Pickled gerkins, capers, or onions, for some boiled meats, 
stews, etc. 

A red pepper, or small red apple, for the mouth of a roast 

pig- 
Spots of red and black pepper alternated on the fat side 

of a boiled ham, which side should lie uppermost on the 

serving dish. 

Sliced eggs, showing the white and yellow parts, for 
chicken salad. 

Sprays of celery top for salads, cold meats, etc. 

Royal Displays. 

A peep at some royal table displays is valuable as sug- 
gesting what may be done. Perhaps the grandest display 
ever made was by Baron Rothschild in honor of the last 
Napoleon when at the height of his power, some five years 
before his fall. The entertainment was given at Rothschild's 



SERVING MEALS. 333 

regal pleasure-house of Ferrieres, thirty miles out of Paris. 
The cost of the out-door decorations alone exceeded 
;^ 1 00,000. Workmen were put on the road in vast gangs, 
and had it prepared with asphaltum every inch of the way. 
Chinese lanterns and Bengal lights rendered it brilliant as 
day. Forests of new trees in full growth were set out 
wherever the roadside happened to be bare. The imperial 
carriage, which left the Tuileries at five o'clock p. M., passed 
through continuous masses of jubilant spectators. Wine 
and edibles were given by the Rothschilds' orders to all 
along the route who bore decorations of any sort. 

The chateau itself, which is as roomy as the Capitol at 
Washington, was a blaze of light and rich drapery. The din- 
ing-room and the feast were thus described in a leading 
journal : 

" It was such a scene as the mind conjures in Aladdin's 
palace, built by the slaves of the gold and jewel caves. At 
a vast height from the floor a narrow gallery runs around 
the chamber. From this were suspended folds of golden 
drapery, in which some legend of Bonapartist glory flashed 
out in jeweled letters. The walls were encrusted with 
treasures that the house of Rothschild had been centuries 
collecting. The tables were a mass of glittering gold, even 
to the candelabra The dinner began at nine o'clock and 
was served by waiters in livery rivaling the imperial in 
sumptuousness. The knives and forks were of solid gold, 
and when the dinner was ended the head of the house 
solemnly directed them gathered together and in presence 
of the Emperor ordered them melted and the mass sent to 
the mint, declaring that, having been sanctified by imperial 
use, they should never be degraded to baser hands." 



IV.— THE BILL OF FARE. 

bills of fare needed; edibles in season ; what to have for 
breakfast, dinner, luncheon, tea, and supper; plain 
luncheons; plain dinners; quantities needed; odd 

BILLS OF fare. 

WHAT shall be served for a meal is in most homes a hap- 
hazard affair. Somebody wants a certain dish, or 
something happens to be in the house, or a huckster 
comes along offering a certain article at a low price, and so the 
diet for the day is determined. The religious customs of some 
persons decide the bill of fare for certain days, and so far their 
domestic management is controlled. Others, especially in 
cheap boarding-houses, have a bill of fare inflexible as the 
ancient laws of the Medes and Persians. You know when 
to look for that greasy vegetable soup, made out of — fortu- 
nately for the eater, he knows not what. Then comes cab- 
bage day — regular as the week revolves it comes ; and that 
beefsteak and onions — the house is odorous with it, and you 
are greeted with its fragrance as you clamber up the front 
steps. The desserts, too, are fearfully regular. Boiled rice, 
corn-starch pudding, huckleberry pie in its season, canned 
peaches both in season and out of season, apple pie or cus- 
tard pie — these, with a few more of the same family, march 
on in their ceaseless round with the same old sequence as 
the figures follow each other in a cheap puppet show. These 
are travesties on a bill of fare. They burlesque the menu. 

A housekeeper should plan out her table offerings with 
great care. Her dishes should suit the seasons. On a 
frosty day in midwinter substantial, well-seasoned food is 
needed. It renews a hungry man. It stays by him. It does 
him good. But the same dinner in midsummer will disgust 

334 



THE BILL OF FARE. 335 

rather than delight. On a hot, exhausting day, heavy soups, 
substantial meats, and rich desserts are out of harmony. 
Light meats, delicate vegetables, and cooling desserts are 
then in demand. i 

Dishes .should suit the days of the week also. What can 
be furnished by one fire or wash-day or ironing-day is not 
the same as can be furnished conveniently on other days. 
The man who proposed dumplings for wash-day dessert be- 
cause they could be boiled in the same kettle with the 
clothes was on the true line of progress, though his appli- 
cation was not a happy one. The idea is that harmony 
shall exist The washing must not suffer for the dinner, 
nor the dinner for the washing. Plan the bill of fare to fit 
the movements of the domestic establishment. 

A third point to be gained by planning is unity in each 
meal. Some articles of food, delicious in themselves, are 
unpalatable, and even unwholesome, in combination. 
Cucumbers or beets and milk, fish and milk, lobster and 
ice-cream, are combinations of this class ; while peaches 
and cream, lamb and green peas, stewed chicken and waf- 
fles, catfish and coffee, are fitly wedded, and no man can 
put them asunder. To secure all the above-named happy 
coincidences and combinations is the mission of the well- 
digested bill of fare. 

Of course, the pocket controls many of these things. He 
who cannot have his turkey and venison and plum-pudding 
6n Christmas day, may, nevertheless, find satisfactory chew- 
ing on his boiled goose, and savory garnishing in his sour- 
krout or cabbage. But the poorest meals will be the better, 
like the artist's colors, when " mixed with brains." Think 
and plan. How can these things be best done ? Settle that 
question and carry out your conclusion with a queenly 
grace. But be open for the teachings of experience. What 
does not work well be ready to change. Those who never 
change their plans are poor learners. ^

A bowl of hot, light soup is very acceptable at luncheon 
also. Luncheons are sometimes made quite elaborate, and 
become very pleasant company occasions. 

Late suppers are served by some who have the late din- 
ners, but unless they sit up very much later, the practice 
must soon affect them very injuriously. For supper, or tea, 
given at the usual hours, say from six to eight o'clock, the 
bill of fare suggested for breakfast may serve in substance. 
The later the supper the lighter it should be. Strong tea 
or coffee should not be used near bed-time if sound sleep 
is desired. 

Specimen bills of fare are given below. They are in suit- 
able form for the hostess to follow, and also for the printer 
to follow if it be desired to produce either of them in type.

And now, what more on bills of fare does the good house- 
wife need ? Possibly she needs some hints as to cold 
lunches for wash-days, house-cleaning times, and other days 
of extra work. She shall have a few such hints : 

PLAIN HOME LUNCHEONS. 

No. 1. — Cold corn-beef, nicely sliced ; baked potatoes; 
bread, butter, and pickles. Dessert — mince pie and cheese. 

No. 2. — Chicken pie, baked potatoes ; rolled bread or bis- 
cuit. Dessert — cake and custard. 

No. 3. — First course: Raw oysters, with lemon and 
crackers. Second course : Cold veal, with jelly and Sara- 
toga potatoes, bread, and butter. Dessert — pie with cheese. 

No. 4. — Casserole of fish, with mushroom catsup ; bread 
and butter. Dessert — cherry pie with cheese. 

Possibly some hints as to economical dishes for dinner 
may be of service. Such hints, adapted to each day of the 
week, are added to render this needed service. 

DINNER FOR EVERY DAY. ^^^ 

Sunday. — Roast beef, potatoes, and greens. Dess^n^r- 
pudding or pie, cheese. : . : 

Monday. — Hashed beef, potatoes, and bread-pudding. 

Tuesday. — Broiled beef, vegetables, apple-pudding. 

Wednesday. — Boiled pork, beans, potatoes, greens, and 
pie, or rice-pudding. 

Thursday. — Roast or broiled fowl, cabbage, potatoes, lemon 
pie, cheese. 

Friday. — Fish, potato croquettes, escalloped tomatoes, 
pudding. 

Saturday. — A la mode beef, potatoes, vegetables, suet-pud- 
ding and mince pie, cheese.

.^ As one who attempts to master the many dishes at the 
table of a great hotel finds himself worsted, so the house- 
wife who attempts at once to master the foregoing sugges- 
tions will find herself Patient and repeated attention, how- 
ever, will master the whole. 

QUANTITY OF PROVISION NEEDED.. 

What quantity of the standard articles must be provided 
for entertainments ? This question is a practical one of no 
small importance. Nobody wishes to run short at a com- 
pany, nor does a prudent person care to waste good food. 
How then shall estimates be made which can be fairly 
depended on ? Experience shows the following general 
principles to hold good. 

It is safe to assume that of one hundred and fifty invited 
guests, but two-thirds of the number will be present. If 
five hundred are invited, not more than three hundred can 
be counted upon as accepting. Smaller numbers will be 
more largely represented in proportion. 

Allow one quart of oysters to every three persons present. 
Five chickens, or, what is better, a ten-pound turkey, boiled 
and minced, and fifteen heads of celery, are enough for 
chicken salad for fifty guests ; allow one gallon of ice-cream 
to every twenty guests ; one hundred and thirty sandwiches 
for one hundred guests ; and six to ten quarts of wine jelly 
for each hundred. 

For a company of twenty, allow three chickens for salad ; 
one hundred pickled oysters ; two molds of Charlotte 
russe ; one gallon of cream, and four dozen biscuits.

VARIETIES OF TABLE LINEN. — FANCY FOLDING OF NAPKINS. 

WHEN Solomon described the model woman of his 
day, among other praiseworthy things he said of 
her was this : " She maketh fine linen, and selleth 
it." Into what forms she put this fine linen is not stated, 
butwe maybe sure that 



some was table-linen. 
With the imperfect ap- 
pliances of that day 
she could not equal 
Brown's Irish linens, 
which are now the 
standards ; but, doubt- 
less, she kept her fine 
linen pure and white. 
Such linen is fitly asso- 
ciated with royalty in 
many references of an- 
tiquity, and with the 
purity of saints in refer- 
ences of the Scripture. 
There is no finer 
field for the display of 
a housewife's neatness 
than is found in table- 
linen. It adds so much 
to every meal, or de- 
tracts so seriously from 
it, that everybody appreciates skill in its management.

All our linen tablecloths and napkins are imported and 

are made of efenuine linen. 



Highly colored cloths are 
not linen. Flax will not 
take high coloring. The 
highly colored cloths and 
napkins are cotton, and are 
generally of domestic origin. 
True linens for table uses 
are pure white, white and 
brown, or white with border- 
ing of light colors. They 
are made plain, with simple 
figures, or in elaborate pat- 
terns. The largest pattern 
tablecloths regularly in the 
market are two and a half 
yards wide by eight yards 
long. Tablecloths cut from 
piece goods can be had of 
any length. 

Napkins of regular make 
are five-eighths, six-eighths, 
or seven-eighths of a yard

Doilies can be had from four inches square upward. The 
smallest sizes are used by dentists ; 
the next under finger-bowls ; the 
largest sizes are used with fruit, etc. 
They, too, can be had to match 
cloths and napkins of standard 
colors and styles. 

White table-linen is the article for 
dinners and formal meals. Colored 
linen, or cotton goods, are admis- 
sible at tea or luncheon. The 
whole equipment of linen at a given 
meal should be of one and the same 
kind and color. Good table-linen 
requires no starch. It will polish 
well by good ironing. It should al- 
ways be immaculately clean. Slop- 
ped, stained, fly-covered table-linen is 
disgusting. A floor-cloth should not be used in the sad- 
ly soiled condition in 
which many a table- 
cloth does duty. 

A large, well-lighted, 
and well-aired closet 
should be appropriated 
for table-linen. Unless 
the washing would 
thereby become crush- 
ingly heavy, the better 
way is to wash every 
napkin after one using. 
Dispense with the nap- 
kin-ring. It does guar- 
antee to a man his own 
soiled linen ; but it is far better to give him clean linen.

A plain square fold of the napkin can be made by a child, 

as may an ordinary fun- 
nel or cone-shaped twist, 
so that the napkin may 
be set into a goblet. But 
beyond these simple 
forms there are artistic 
heights of napkin-folding 
to which only profes' 
sionals attain. It is the 
boast of some skilled 
linen-men of the caterers 
that they can fold nap- 
kins in fifty, sixty, and 
even a hundred ways. 
Sure it is that Masonic 
dinners can be served 
with the square and com- 
pass in napkins ; mili- 
tary men can have the 
tent ; physicians can 
have the mortar and 
pestle, and so on indefi- 
nitely. 

To accomplish fine 

work in this line a full-sized 
napkin must be used, and it 
must be well starched and 
ironed flat. Amateurs in 
the art should practice on 
paper of proper size. Practice 
will promote expertness, and to devise new forms will soon 
be easy and entertaining work. In our diagrams of napkin- 
folding the relative sizes of the several folds are not main- 
tained strictly, but the folds are shown correctly.

EXPLANATION OF DIAGRAMS. 



A. Double Columns. — A-i, the 
parts, not creased. A-2, one 
.edge rolled toward the fold. 
A-3, napkin turned over and 
points of top fold turned out- 
ward. A-4, partly rolled, with 
fold of A-2 surrounding the 



first fold into three equal 





base and point center- 
ing accurately. A, both 
ends rolled, showing 
completed form. Either 
side shows well when 
completed, and if evenly 
done, it will stand alone 
and be very beautiful on 
a table or in a goblet. 

B. Water Lily.— B-i, 
the. first fold, each cor- 
ner to the centre. B-2-, 
the second fold, each cor- 
ner again to the centre. 
B-3, the napkin turned 
over and each corner 
brought from below to 
the centre again. B-4, 
corners once more to the 
centre without turning 
the napkin over. B-5, 
corners from the under side turned outward, on to which 
the upper points also are then turned. B-6, the smaller 
points exposed by the last turn folded outward to secure 
eight points. B, the smaller points turned upward around

the smaller ; the lowermost points tucked under, the four 

prominent corners also 
folded under, so mak- 
ing the base circular- — 
the entire four lying 
close to the bottle. 



C. Mitre.— C- 1, first 
fold into three equal 
parts. C-2, each end 
folded in toward, but not 
entirely to, the centre. 
C-3, opposite corners of 
C-2 folded down. C-4, 
fold C-3 backward so 
i 1 that the two oblique folds 
there shown shall be 
together and parallel, 
but allow the points to 
stand erect. C-5, fold 
the right-hand end up- 
ward just at the highest 
point and tuck its end 
under the fold C, as indi- 
cated by the arrows. 
Turn the left-hand end 
from you and tuck it 
under the fold on the 
opposite side, when you 
will have C, the mitre 
form, which will stand beautifully on a plate. 

D. Capucllin. — D-i, napkin folded into three equal parts. 
D-2, second fold. D-3, napkin turned over and the points 
rolled upward. D-4, right-hand end folded under in a line

perpendicular to the longer fold, so that the roll stands per- 
pendicular to the base-line shown in D-3. The left-hand 
end then folds the sarfie, 
showing both rolls as 
one appears in D-4. The 
top will then show a 
square as in D, and in 
the fold beneath it a roll 
of bread may be placed, 
or the folded napkin may 
lie on the plate. 

E. Lady's Slipper. — 
E-i is the napkin folded 
in three equal parts. 
E-2 represents the re- 
sult of two folds — the 
first turning the right- 
hand half upward upon 
the left at an angle of 
about forty-five degrees ; 
the second fold bringing 
the same end back into 
the position shown in 
E-2. The left-hand end 
is then treated in the 
same manner, producing 
the result exhibited in 
E-3. E-4 represents 
the preceding form with 
one corner tucked into 
the slipper, as indicated 
by the arrow, and E 
shows the final result, 

with both corners adjusted in their proper position.

F. Tulip.' — F-i shows the napkin folded in three equal 
parts. F-2 shows its ends turned inward, as in C-2. F-3 

shows the right-hand 
lower corner turned up- 
ward, the left to be 
treated in the same 
way. To produce F-4, 
turn the napkin over, 
the point from you, 
and turn up the right- 
hand lower corner until 
it appears as in the dia- 
gram. Bring up the 
lower left-hand corner and tuck it into the fold show^n in 





F-4. This gives F-5 when placed erect, and the final form, 

F, is readily produced

VI.— WORK AND HELP. 

the domestic struggle ; ** flats; " regularity; forethought; 
supervision; accountability; kitchens; conveniences; 

KITCHEN company; GENERAL HINTS. 

THERE is no housekeeper who will not weary of the 
household work if she attempt to do it in person ; nor 
is there one whose patience will not be sorely tried if 
she attempt to do it by proxy. Physical exhaustion on the 
one side, and mental exhaustion on the other, are the Scylla 
and Charybdis between which the good housewife struggles 
to guide the domestic craft. Some make fairly good pro- 
gress in the effort, but more are sorely tried and buffeted, 
while many finally go down in the whirlpool of boarding- 
house or hotel life, or are shattered and scattered as families. 

The comparatively new method of " flats," as conducted 
in New York, Chicago,- and San Francisco, is a Parisian 
idea adapted to American necessities. In immense struc- 
tures, with eight or ten floors, apartments are fitted up usually 
in sumptuous style, with every convenience and luxury. 
Elevators carry the residents and callers to any floor, so that 
the ninth floor is virtually as good as the first. The hall- 
ways and apartments are heated and cared for by house 
servants ; the meals are served a la carte, in a general din- 
ing-hall or restaurant, or are served in the rooms if desired; 
so that the only care the occupants have is the incidental 
charge of their own rooms and their social duties. This 
method avoids all personal labor and all care about servants, 
and yet each family has its own home. 

Of course there are no yards or gardens in such places. 
When there are little children in a family the opportunities 

358 



work: AND HELP, 359 

are rather restricted. The old home idea is wholly 
lost in such a dwelling-place. Domestic duties are in utter 
disuse. Home cooking has no foothold. Home decoration 
may be practiced to a limited extent, and home courtesy 
may prevail ; but after all, the home life barely exists. 

In the old-fashioned home life, regularity is a prime factor. 
Without it all will speedily run to disorder. To do things 
regularly requires forethought and planning. What to do 
and when to do it, must both be clearly understood. Then 
the predetermined plans must be rigidly adhered to and 
carried through. Servants see at a glance whether the head 
of the house ** means business " or not. Any number of 
orders may be issued, but if the servants know that it means 
nothing, they do not concern or bestir themselves. Orders 
should be few as possible, but they should be well con- 
sidered and explicit, and when once issued they should be 
conformed to absolutely. 

Vaporing, scolding, fretting, and storming about the house 
only lower the lady of the establishment in the esteem of her 
employees. Her superiority must appear in her calm delib- 
eration and her intelligently formed decisions. But 
these need not be issued in an arbitrary, dictatorial form. 
The American spirit does not brook much of this. Help 
worth having can suit iteelf readily in other places, and such 
help will not submit to arbitrary or tyrannical treatment. 

One of the best advisers of young housekeepers says to 
them : " Never, except in cases of extreme emergency, 
allow Monday's washing to be put off till Tuesday, Tues- 
day's ironing till Wednesday, or Wednesday's finishing up 
and setting to rights till Thursday. Leave Thursday for 
extra work ; or when that is not required, for a resting day 
or a half holiday, and as a preparation for the up-stairs 
sweeping and dusting of Friday, and the down-stairs baking 
and scrubbing of Saturday." In this advice all good house- 
wives will concur, though the men of the house, to quote 



3^0 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

one such, " cannot see why so arbitrary and inflexible a rule 
should be imposed upon the domestic economy." 

Forethought will prove a great help in saving time, fuel, 
labor, and temper. For example : Mix bread at night, and 
it will be ready to bake with that " first fire," which always 
makes the oven hot in the morning. 

Prepare firuit over night, so that pies or other prepara- 
tions for dessert can be quickly made, and baked imme- 
diately after the bread. 

Prepare hash for breakfast over night. 
Have the kitchen and dining-room, put in order before 
going to bed. 

Have kindlings and whatever is requried for building 
needed fires laid out ready, and the fire in the kitchen raked 
down, so that it can be started in the shortest possible time. 
This is not only a saving in the morning, but it will be 
found very useful in case of illness in the night when a fire 
may be required at a moment's notice. 

Much work is saved by forethought in purchases. If 
possible, lay in winter supplies ; buy starch, sugar, soap, tea, 
etc., etc., in quantities reasonably large, and deliver them to 
the kitchen as needed; it may be by the week, or twice a 
week. It should not be so often as to become irksome, not 
so seldom as to lose sight of what is going on. Dried 
soap will prove an immense saving by its hardness, as com- 
pared with the soft, fresh bars for which the servant runs 
twice or thrice a week. Money and labor both are saved 
by such forethought as this. 

Constant supervision is essential to securing good work. 
Eye-service is the bane of our laboring classes. See that 
orders are obeyed ; see that things are put to proper uses ; 
see that house-cloths do not become dish-cloths, or vice 
vei^sa ; that hand-towels do not become cup-towels, or vice 
versa; that combs, brushes, etc., etc., are kept out of the 
cooking apartment ; that the cellar broom is not used on 



WORR' AND HELP. 3gl 

the parlor carpet, or vice versa. Indeed, there is no end to 
the points that the housewife must supervise, if she be 
determined to have her work well done. 
. Accountability for articles belonging to each department 
must be insisted on with every servant. No article must be 
allowed to disappear without a sufficient reason. Nor must 
anything be out of its proper place, except as necessary. 
Explain to each new servant the nature of this accountability 
and hold every one steadily to it. 

It is said that American kitchens are the worst in the 
world. Work is very materially promoted by means of a 
good kitchen. It should be roomy, light, and capable of 
good ventilation without sending its odors and its steam 
through the house. It should have plenty of good, con- 
venient closets for all that pertains to the work there done. 
It should have direct access to the fuel, store-rooms, or cel- 
lar where provisions are stored, and convenient access to the 
dining-room. A window communication is best between 
kitchen and dining-room, using a waiting-maid to receive. 

The conveniences of range, hot and cold water, sink, etc., 
are desirable, of course, but in some places they are not 
attainable. A dish-drainer is a great convenience. It 
may be made of a grooved board, slightly inclined so as to 
drain the water back into the sink or dish-pan. Dishes 
laid upon this as washed, that they may drain a few minutes, 
will be found in much better condition for wiping, and so 
labor will be saved. An elevated strip must surround all 
but the lower edge of this drainer to prevent the dishes 
from slipping off. 

Kitchen company seriously interferes with work and 
service. The employees of a house are social beings. They 
have their associations and must continue to have them, but 
much visiting destroys effective management. It demoral- 
izes servants and delays work. Company should be re- 
stricted to certain convenient hours. The indiscriminate fur- 



362 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

nishing of meals to their visitors by servants should not be 
permitted. Permission at that point should be asked of the 
lady of the house, and she, not the servant, should judge 
whether the case is exceptional and allowable. Interfer- 
ence in the presence of the *' guests " would probably create 
a scene, but a good understanding at the outset would be 
as likely to preclude all trouble. Indeed, so few housewives 
know their own minds in domestic management, that the 
servants are little to blame if they too are ignorant of " the 
lady's " mind. Be reasonable with servants ; yea, be gen- 
erous ; but be explicit and decided. 

After this extended discussion, it still remains true that 
the thoughful, self-poised, kindly, but decided housewife 
will be the only one who will get the needed work done, and 
will find all her " help " really helpful. It seems wise to 
conclude this chapter with a few carefully selected 

HINTS ON HOME WORK. 

Aprons. — Have a good assortment of full-sized aprons 
which can be washed. They should be long and wide. 

Brooms. — Four brooms should be in simultaneous use in a 
house. The best for the parlor and best rooms ; the second 
best for the sitting-room and dining-room ; the third for 
the kitchen ; the last for the cellar, yard, etc. When the best 
broom shows wear, replace it with a new one, and " retire " 
the worst_, moving the others back one place. Hang up 
brooms by a loop, or better, by a broom holder. (See Chap- 
ter xxi, Part I.) 

Closets, etc. — Scrub them out thoroughly and frequently. 
Cover dish-shelves with clean white papers ; the edges may 
be scolloped, or " pinked," if desired.

WORK AND HELP. 363 

Dusters. — Feather dusters throw dust from one place to 
another. They are poor tools, except for the lightest kind 
of work. Cloths' are preferable. These should be shaken 
out-of-doors frequently, or washed. Damp chamois skins 
are best for articles not liable to damage by dampness. 

Fuel. — When cooking is not going on, the fire should be 
slacked by closing the dampers, etc. Coal should never be 
piled high in the stoves. It chokes the draft, makes heat 
tvhere it does no good, burns out the stove tops, and wastes 
willfully. Ashes should be sifted and picked over. A large ■ 
saving will be effected thus. 

Holders. — Iron-holders, and others for hot pots, kettles, 
etc., will save time, labor, and burns. If such conveniences 
do not exist, towels will be substituted by the " help." 

Ironing Tools. — Keep the cloths, etc., in good, orderly 
shape in a clean, dry place. The irons must be kept free 
from moisture. 

Paper and String. — Lay all such together in a convenient 
place, nicely straightened out, ready for use at any time. If 
too much accumulates, sell it or burn it. 

Pie-board. — This, with the roller, should be put away 
clean every time, in a scrupulously clean place. 

Pots and Kettles. — Put away thoroughly cleaned and well 
dried. Scald out coffee and tea-pots frequently with soda- 
water. Keep each in its proper place. 

Refrigerators. — Scrub and air these frequently. The 
purest and best makes need such treatment. 

Water Coolers. — Scrub and air these. Sediment will col- 
lect which must be unwholesome and unsavory. 

WMsks. — Use a clean, fine whisk for upholstered furniture. 
Have others for the stairs, corners of rooms, etc. All these 
in addition to whisks used for clothing. 



VII.— VENTILATION. 

VENTILATION NEEDED; HOW TO GET IT J BY WINDOWS; BY A 

shaft; with THE heat; facts and figures. 

FRESH air is essential to healthful and happy human 
existence. It is so free and abundant that there should 
be no lack anywhere or at any time. Out-of-doors we 
get it without care or planning ; but to get it in-doors, and 
so to get it that nobody is harmed, that nobody catches 
cold or gets the rheumatism, that is the problem. 

Every living being gives off the deadly carbonic acid gas 
continually, and at the same time consumes the vitalizing 
oxygen. Lamps, fires, combustion of all sorts, does the 
same, some forms of these being more active than others in 
the emission of carbonic acid gas. For every apartment 
where people live and fires burn there must be ventilation. 
Fresh air must come in, and foul air must go out. 

In cold weather, this must be so done that a reasonable 
warmth in the room shall be maintained, and it must always 
be so done that chilling drafts shall not strike persons in 
such way as to check perspiration and produce sickness. 

Ventilation in large buildings is usually provided for by 
forcing fresh air through all its ramifications. The air is 
admitted in such ways as shall most effectually diffuse it 
•through the building, avoiding all blasts or sensible currents. 
If mechanical means are employed to force air, the problem 
is comparatively simple. Drive in enough air and distribute 
it with judgment, and it is all done. ' 

But dwelling-houses do not admit of these elaboicLte 

364 



ventilation: 



365 



arrangements except in rare cases. How can they be venti- 
lated ? The commonest way is to open the window. If a 
wind be stirring, or if the temperature within and without the 
room vary much, currents of air will at once set in, and an 
open window will do the desired work. But if the atmos- 
phere be still and sultry, the windows may be open, and yet 
no interchange of air take place. The top of the window 
allows egress to the heated air. The bottom allows ingress 
to the colder, external air. To ventilate a room, both open- 
ings of the window are needed. If windows are only on 
one side of a room, a door upon the other side must be 
open to do the work properly. Currents which would be 
too strong, may be well broken by the ordinary shutter 
blinds, the angle given the slats determining the direction 
of currents to a great extent, and so breaking their volume 
as to render them practically harmless. 
;cr An easy adaptation of ordinary windows for a good ven- 
tilating purpose is secured by inserting 
on the sill, where the bottom sash shuts 
down, a piece of wood the thickness of the 
sash, and long as the sash is wide, but 
about three inches high ; the effect being 
that the sash, shutting down on this strip, 
shall stand three inches above the sill and 
yet the bottom will be closed tight. The 
displacement between the upper and lower 
sash will leave an opening by which cur- 
rents of air will pass in and out, ventilating 
the room very fairly, and that, too, with- 
out any perceptible draft. 

Another simple method is to tack muslin or ornamental 
cloth across the bottom of the window frame, inside the 
room, but not against the sash. The window may then be 
raised. The muslin should rise three times the height of 
the opening of the window. The effect of this is to produce 




A CHEAP JVTETHOD 
OF VENTILATION. 



"366 ^^-^^' novs/<ivjFKS library. 

an intercxiange of air, with positively no perceptible draft, 
even when the wind without is high. 

From the summit of the hallway, or open stairway of a 
house, it is well to carry an open pipe high above the roof, 
capped so as to keep out storm, and capable of being closed 
in- the coldest weather. It will draw off the heated air of 
the house and render good service. 

A ventilating shaft is a great accessory to a house. It 
should be like a large flue, say two feet square, and by in- 
serting glass at the top it may be used for light also. Into 
such a shaft openings from the several rooms may be made, 
also from water-closets and reservoirs. This shaft should 
be placed next to a chimney flue which is always in use, so 
that the shaft itself will be warm enough to produce move- 
ment in the air. Or a surer way is to have at its base a 
heating apparatus of gas, oil, or steam, by means of which 
the current of air may be moved in the shaft and the entire 
house be ventilated. The outlet of such a shaft must be so 
constructed that snow and rain will not drive in even when, 
the windows in it are open. It should be capable of entire 
closing also by means of cords and pulleys. 

Every fire drawing its oxygen from a room, carries air 
out of the room, and this consumed air must be replaced 
through cracks or crevices, if by no better means. Some 
ventilation is always gained where such fires burn, therefore. 
But when they burn low, it is a chance that they will emit 
more injurious gases than the fresh air drawn in can coun- 
terbalance. 

All heating methods which throw warmed air into the 
room may become valuable methods of ventilation. If the 
air be drawn direct from a foul cellar they will be injurious. 
If the air be baked by contact with red-hot surfaces, it will 
be dry and to a great extent stripped of its oxygen. But 
take the air from without, if possible from the top of the 
house, by means of a cold-air flue ; heat this air by contact 



VENTILA TJON". 3g 7 

with steam pipes or hot pipes, but not those which are red- 
hot, and you will have warm air and good air at one and 
the same time. Apertures or registers near the floor are 
needed in this case, by means of which cold air passes away. 
Near the floor the foul, heavy air settles also, which is driven 
out by the same means. Registers opening into a ventilat- 
ing shaft, as. just described, form the best escape for impure 
air, as they carry it entirely out of the house. 

Some authorities recommend that ventilating openings be 
made directly into smoke-flues. Even if smoke and soot 
can be kept from entering the room where such a device is 
employed, which is doubtful, notwithstanding " traps " and 
other warranted contrivances, still every opening of this 
kind subtracts from the draft power of the fire below the 
opening, and hence is a disadvantage. The independent 
ventilation shaft is the most valuable help. 

To enforce the need of ventilation, it may be stated that a 
pound of coal burned requires for its combustion one hun- 
dred and forty-eight cubic feet of air. Every gas-burner 
consumes about thirty-six cubic feet per hour. A candle 
consumes about eleven cubic feet per hour. A healthy 
adult requires two hundred and fifteen cubic feet of air per 
hour. Combining these facts, the absolute necessity of a 
large supply of fresh air to every living-room is an easy 
demonstration. 



VIII.— WARMING. 

bonfires; fireplaces; franklin stoves; grates; low-down 
grates; modern stoves; heaters; gas stoves. 

IN the last chapter some points on the warming of houses 
have been touched. Ventilation and warming are sub- 
jects so closely related that they cannot be considered 
fully when apart. As in cooking, so in warming, the sim- 
plest method is the open fire, the mere bonfire in short. But 
from such a fire, it is an easy step to an inclosing structure 
which cuts off radiation of heat in useless directions and 
conducts smoke where it will do the least harm. On this 
principle the old-fashioned fireplaces were constructed. 
They did very little work in proportion to the fuel consumed, 
but where fuel was abundant that mattered little. Then, too, 
in such fires, at least one-half of the heat goes up the 
chimney, and some good authorities say that fifteen-six- 
teenths is thus lost. Such fires heat by direct radiation. 
Heat is thrown from them directly on the persons in the 
room, on the walls and other objects. These become heated, 
and in turn reflect heat so that all the contents of the room, 
atmosphere, and solid bodies are thoroughly warmed at last. 
Until this completeness of heating is attained, however, one 
may be blistering his face while cold creeps run down his 
back. Then, too, such heat quickly falls off It is irregular, 
expensive, unsatisfactory. 

Benjamin Franklin made an improvement on the old warm- 
ing methods in the stoves which bear his name. He saved 
much of the heat which formerly escaped by making his 
.stove to sit in the room, and the smoke to reach the chimney 
by a circuitous passage, as in a stove-pipe. This compelled 

368 



WARMING. 



369 



much escaping heat to give off its power in the room. The 
fireplace of this stove was inclosed with another casing of 
iron, through which air circulated and passed into the room 
in a heated condition. So he had all the direct radiation of 
the fire and of the heated parts of the stove, plus the air 
which was heated by passing through the hot chambers. 

Grates are simply an adaptation of the old fireplace to the 
later discovery of coal as a fuel. They are less open and 
therefore less wasteful, but all the side and back power of 
the fire is lost to the room so far as heating it is concerned. 
It passes off by conduction, and is lost in the walls. 

Low-down grates are a favorite feature for fall and spring 
uses in sitting-rooms, offices, etc. They heat by direct 
radiation only, but for the lighter purposes in warming they 
are desirable as being both beautiful and sufficiently useful. 

A fine specimen of these grates is shown in the accom- 
panying cut. It is made with handsome nickel-plated frame 
and trimmings. In its 



"throat " is a double valve 
arrangement, shown in the 
cut, which can be used as 
a blower in starting the 
fire, as a damper in reduc- 
ing the draft, or as a reflec- 
tor to throw the heat into 
the room. These grates 
have indeed become so 
popular that improvement

been made, and decoration low-down grate. 

has been added to decoration, until they seem absolutely 
perfect, and certainly they are very beautiful. 

Closed stoves heat the air by its contact with their heated 
surfaces. They are now made with mica doors or windows, 
through which the direct radiation also passes, and air

chambers are added in which air is heated, so that stoves of 

an immense warming 
power, and withal 
very easy to manage, 
are now the standards. 
A specimen of these 
heating stoves is here 
given. It is the " Hot 
Base and Anti-cHnker

James Spear, of Phil- 
adelphia. On the next 
page a sectional view 
of this same stove is

The stove shown here has a sheet-iron top. For the sake 
of increased orna- 
mentation, the tops 
are usually made 
in cast-iron, with 
nickel-plated panels 
and embellishment. 
It is an open ques- 
tion which kind of 
top gives off the 
more heat. A tea- 
kettle attachment 
may be made just 
above the upper tier 
of doors if desired. 
By this contrivance 
tea may be boiled, 
and some other mi- 
nor culinary wants 
be met. A nickel- 
plated foot rail may 
be placed around 
the base, adding to 
the beauty of the 
stove, and also to 
its utility. 

Fireplace heaters 
are favorites with 
many communities. 
Like a low-down 
grate, they fill the 
opening of the man- 
tel, but they are 
constructed as heat- 
ers, with drums

placed by direct radiation and heated air ; and to the room 
above heated air is supplied abundantly. These, like other 

modern stoves, are finished in 
very ornate styles. 

Hot-air furnaces have come 
into very general use. They 
combine so many advantages, 
and are vi^ithal so effective, 
that they well deserve the 
favor they have met. To 
elucidate the subject fully, a 
sectional view of a portable 
hdater is given. This differs 
from the permanent or brick- 
inclosed heater chiefly in the 
method of inclosure, and in 
the capacity of the heating- 
drums. 

The time was when but lit- 
tle attention was given to the 
construction of heaters. Al- 
most anything with an iron 
cylinder and a casing around 
it, that would consume coal, 
was considered a sufficient heater. No matter how much 
dust and dirt were made in the cellar or basement, and con- 
veyed through the flues to the parlor or rooms above, it 
was nevertheless supposed to answer for heating purposes. 
But those days have passed away; careful and scientific study 
has been applied to the subject. 

One valuable point in the heater shown in the cut is that 
whereby all ashes and clinker can be removed from the fire^ 
pot without dropping the fire. This can be done with less 
trouble than it takes to rake the old kind of heaters, and a 
continuous fire be kept always fresh on the grate. By this

BLE HEATER. 



WARMING. 373 

means the entire surface of the heater can be relied on for 
heat. In the old heaters, when the grate surface became 
covered with clinkers, and the cylinder half filled with ashes, 
only the upper surface afforded heat, which very often 
resulted in overheating the top and ruining the furnace. 

This heater is supplied with a magazine, making it a self- 
feeder. Another new feature is a radiating drum, and, in 
place of taking the damp, impure air from the cellar floor, 
with the dust and ashes, there is a cold air collar at the 
back of the heater so that a pipe can be attached, and pure, 
fresh air be brought from the outside of the building. 

At the base of the heater, on each side of the cylinder, 
are placed the water tanks, easy of access, where a sufficient 
quantity of water can be evaporated without boiling it. It 
also has a damper at the smoke-pipe. 

To all hot-air furnaces there are serious objections. They 
exhaust the moisture so completely that furniture is dried 
out and falls apart, and, worse than this, the moisture of the 
human system is so reduced that parched lips and difficulty 
of breathing often result. Furnace-heated air is drier than 
that ever heated in the midst of the Desert of Sahara. 
Evaporators may be introduced into the heaters and mois- 
ture may be restored again to the air, but a new danger 
arises. The sediment left by the constant evaporation of 
the water becomes unhealthy. This is demonstrated when, 
by reason of lowness of water in the evaporator, the sedi- 
ment begins to stew or to bake, in which case the house soon 
becomes rank with its offensive odors. The water-pan of 
the heater must be kept clean. Stewing or simmering 
animal or vegetable matter cannot be healthy. 

The principles to be regarded in determining the size of 
a heater are these : The greater the heating surface in a 
heater, the greater is the volume of air it can heat to a given 
temperature in a given time. A low fire will therefore im- 
part warmth to a room fully equal to that from a hot fire in 



374 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

a smaller furnace. The one does a large volume of work 
deliberately. The other does it with a rush ; but in the 
rush the air is baked, its moisture is exhausted, it is made 
unfit for use. The coal required is more in bulk in the 
larger furnaces, but it is not used half so fast. • Large fire- 
pans are better, therefore, and cheaper — of course within 
reasonable bounds. Then, too, the moisture produced at a 
low temperature is preferable to that from excessive heat. 
The former is a gentle vapor, the later a driving steam. 

Hot water and steam are used in various applications for 
heating purposes, but not very generally in private houses, 
except as they heat air carried through coils containing 
steam or hot water. 

Among the contrivances applicable to furnaces and 
heaters of all kinds are governors or regulators, which can 
be set so that when the heat reaches a certain height the 
drafts will close automatically. When the heat falls they 
will open. Thus an equal temperature is maintained even 
in the absence of immediate supervision. 



GAS HEATING-STOVES. 

After seeing the wonderful adaptations of gas to cooking 
purposes, no one will wonder that there are many happy 
adaptations of the same to heating purposes. The Godwin 
Gas Stove Company, from whose constructions the illustra- 
tions already given were selected, furnishes heating-stoves 
also. 

The principles upon which these stoves are constructed 
are thoroughly scientific, and at the same time so simple 
that they require little or no attention. The ventilating 
principle is so applied that no injurious products of com- 
bustion can escape into the room in which they are placed, 
but all are GaFrie<i off to the flue or out-of-doors by the pipe 
seen in the opposite cuts. The stoves have an air passage

through the centre by means of which the air passes up 
from the floor, and in its passage comes in contact with the 
sides of the centre tubes and becomes highly heated. The 
stoves can be made to draw their supply of air from out-of-

doors by means of a tube when so desired. Their consump- 
tion of gas is but seven cubic feet per hour. One of them 
will heat a room containing from eight hundred to one 
thousand cubic feet of space. They are six inches in 
diameter and twenty-three inches high. 

If the open fire appearance is desired, the stove called 
the " Cheerful " meets the case. 

These stoves are especially designed for use in parlors, 
libraries, and sitting-rooms. The panels in the front and 
sides are fitted with porcelain or metal tiles. The frames 
are nickel-plated, or enameled in black or brown with 
bronzed chambers. The tops are of marble, and can be 
varied in color to suit the taste.

They are constructed upon principles so correct scientifi- 
cally, and at the same time so simple, that they require little 
or no attention. They, too, may be made to draw their 
supply of fresh air from out-of-doors, and they carry off the 
results so perfectly that no injurious products of combus-

tion can escape. This stove, in its largest size, is thirty 
inches high, sixteen inches wide, twelve inches deep. 

Smaller stoves are in cast-iron only, but these have a 
boiling burner at the top. The smallest of this line is eleven 
inches high, ten and a half inches wide, and nine inches 
deep. It will warm a small room or take the chill from a 
large one. 



IX.— ILLUMINATION. 

CANDLES, lamps, and gas are so familiar that in their 
ordinary uses they need not be so much as mentioned. 
But all these articles have undergone so much of im- 
provement that a few points concerning them may be of 
value. 

Candles are now 
furnished of very su- 
perior illuminating

now very common, 
they can be had in

so as to be highly orna- 
mental. 

Finely wrought brass 
candlesticks, for use or 
for ornament, are quite 
popular also, though it 
seems like a return to the 
days of our fathers. 

The student-lamp (for 
kerosene oil) has come 
into very extensive use. 
It receives the oil into

argand principle, so that the largest possible amount of 
illuminating surface is secured, with the best possible results. 
In specialties of this character, the Manhattan Brass Com-

York, has done 
many good things. 
The above brack-

thirty-three wax candles, which would make bright a room

Parlor lamps in other patterns of surpassing beauty are 
numerous, two of them with richly ornamented globes being

fine cast or wrought brass and form exquisite decorations. 

• When gas is in- 
troduced into a 
house, the possi- 
bilities afforded in 
the fixtures are 
very fine, as will be 
illustrated farther 
on under the head 
of ** Home Decora- 
tion." The facili- 
ties for the home 
manufacture of gas 
are many and very 
satisfactory. 

Gas machines 
are designed espe- 
cially for the illu- 
mination of build-, 
ings beyond the 
reach of public gas 
works. They can 
be adapted for large 
factories and hotels 
as also for private 
houses. In the 
Springfield Gas Machine gas is produced by bringing a cur- 
rent of air in contact with gasoline, the vapors of which 
combine with the air and produce a clear, white, agreeable 
gas, which is distributed as common gas by similar fixtures. 
The apparatus, as will be seen by the engravings which 
follow, consists of two instruments — an air-pump, operated

by a weight being used to produce the air-current, and a

earth, in which case the expense of the arched vault is 
saved. The air-pump is usually stationed in the cellar of 
the building to be lighted. Supposing a machine to be set

filled with gasoline, and the weight of the pump wound 
the process of gas- 
making is as follows : 
The action of the 
pump draws a supply |J 
of air through the in-'~ 
duction-pipe from 
without the building 
and forces it through 
the air-pipe leading 
to the gas-generator. 
In its passage through 
the generator it be- 
comes carbureted, 
thus forming an illu- 
minating gas that is 
returned by the gas- 
pipe from the top of 
the generator to the 
burners witnm tne^^^^^^ 
building. 

The machine is 
automatic in its ope- 
ration. Gas is made I 
only as fast as con- 
sumed. When the 
burners are shut off 
the pump stops and 
the manufacture of 
gas ceases, but im- 
mediately commences 
when they are opened p 
again. The gas-gene- ^"^ 
rator is recharged 
whenever exhausted — usually once in from three to six

months, varying according to the rapidity of the consump- 
tion of gas. Gauges upon the generator show at any time 
the amount of fluid it contains and when necessary to re- 
plenish it. A doubk-way cock connecting with both the 
filling and vent-pipes in the vault is used, so that of neces- 
sity a free vent is given while filling, thus preventing any 
backward pressure of gas upon the pump or strain upon 
the generator. The weight of the pump does not require 
winding, commonly, oftener than once or twice a week, and 
this takes but a moment's time. 

The pressure of gas in the ordinary gas works is so^ 
strong that there is an immense waste at the burners and 
at every possible crevice for escape. It is wise to turn the 
gas wholly off during the day, using for this purpose a 
connection between the meter and the street, so preventing 
all waste. Even at night the full pressure should not or- 
dinarily be allowed. When the burners are lighted as may 
be desired for the evening, turn down the valve at the me- 
ter until the gas flame just shows the effect. This may' 
cut off nearly half the flow of gas, and yet the light remain 
ample. A great reduction of gas-bills will be secured in this 
way. You will get the benefit of all you pay for, as no 
gas will escape unconsumed. 

When light is desired all night in a bedroom, by all 
means use tapers. A box of these, costing ten cents, 
can be bought at the apothecaries, and will last many 
weeks. Each box contains a tiny socket, or circle, of tin 
with three sharp points holding a bit of cork. Into this 
socket sets a button-mold a quarter of an inch in diame- 
ter, with a hole in the middle, in which is inserted a bit of 
waxed wicking. The whole affair, not larger in circumfer- 
ence than a walnut, floats on the surface of a cup or tum- 
bler full of lard-oil, and gives a very soft and pleasant light, 
and is perfectly safe and wholesome.

THERE is much sickness in these days which passes as 
Bilious, Typhoid, or Malarial Fevers. The inciting 
causes of disease are not easily determined. There are 
physical conditions which predispose to disease. Often 
these are wholly independent of the immediate cause under 
which the patient succumbs. In other cases, the final crash 
is only an advanced stage of the derangement which has 
gone forward steadily under continuous inciting causes. 
This is the case in that class of diseases to which reference 
has been made. 

When a good housewife sees any of her charge losing 
appetite, vigor, color, and ambition, it is certain that some 
evil influence is at work, for which thorough search should 
at once be made. It may be that poisonous gases are creep- 
ing up the waste-pipe of the permanent wash-basin. It may 
be that the bath-room is belching forth death. It may be 
that the cistern whence the drinking-water comes is receiv- 
ing pollution from surface drainage or from some hidden 
flow of vileness. It may be that noxious gases are exuding 
from the ground itself, " made ground," perhaps, into which 
filth of all sorts has been dumped. It may be that a drain- 
pipe is broken or leaking, and that the soil about the house 
is becoming saturated with waste waters, which ferment and 
putrefy, and send up deadly vapors, even from beds of 
flowers. These are a few of the insidious ways in which 
sewer gas and other poisonous influences do their work.

384 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

When water is introduced into a house its drainage must 
be perfect. Every opening from the pipes must be so 
" trapped " that gases cannot work back into the house. 
Scientific plumbing alone can secure this point. The best 
made trap may be so set that the water will syphon out of 
it, and leave no " water-seal " to stop the ingress of sewer 
gases. If this be properly arranged gas will not force back 
through the water except under pressure, as when a 'heavy 
rain storm fills the sewers. To meet this liability, ever>' 
trap should have a ventilating pipe from its arch, or the side 
away from the opening into the house. This pipe must be 
carried to the roof, and there left open. All the gases will 
thus find vent. A still better plan is to carry the soil-pipe 
directly to the roof, capping it £o exclude storm, but not to re^ 
strict the outflow of gas. Scrupulous cleanliness and frequent 
disinfecting of the pipes by copperas, dissolved in hot water, 
are essential. In a few hours the water of the seal will ab- 
sorb gases so as to become in itself a source of impurity. 
What is known as " seat ventilation " is the best remedy for 
this, or frequent flushing. 

Filters will separate material impurities from drinking- 
water, but the deadliest ingredients are not removable in 
this way. The only remedy for a well that receives impurity 
from the depths is to fill it up. If impure from surface 
drainage, cement and better grading may save it. Chemical 
analysis alone can detect the subtle poisons which often lurk 
in water. Some most sparkling and beautiful waters are 
rank poison. If suspicious of water and unable to provide 
a sure remedy, use rain water. It lacks the life of good 
spring water, but it also lacks the death that always lurks 
in city wells and generally in those of villages and rural 
settlements. 

Cellars are nearer akin to graves than many suspect. Good, 
hard, impenetrable cement floors and walls are essential in 
most localities. Noxious influences lurking in the soil and

oozing thence can be hermetically sealed down by no other 
means. An abundance of whitewash is good for a cellar. 
Frequent sweeping and airing, with the careful removal of 
decaying vegetables or fruits, must be added. 

If suspicious of drainage, dig and see. A leaky pipe, 
even when several feet under ground, has cost many a life. 
Allow no marshy places, no pools of stagnant water, no 
compost heaps, or other foul spots upon your home prem- 
ises. Do not allow the earth about the kitchen door to be 
saturated with slops thrown out. Make other disposition of 
such refuse. Cleanliness is akin to godliness and also to 
healthfulness. 

In a drain for a private house a four-inch pipe Is suffi- 
cient. It is better than one twice the size, as the flow is 
more concentrated and powerful. Straight lines and even 
descents are always desirable. Every deviation presents an 
obstacle and invites stoppage. The jointing must be very 
perfect, or it will check solid material, causing stoppage and 
leakage, with their long train of expense and sickness. To 
prevent the slow flow of water, which is apt to result in 
stoppage in drain pipes, flushing tanks have been invented. 
These operate on a syphon principle, emptying the tank at 
intervals with a rush of water which sweeps all dehis be- 
fore it. 

The latest conclusions in scientific drainage require an 
air-pipe to connect with every trap of the drainage system, 
on the sewer side of the curve, so that when water goes 
down the soil-pipe with a rush, it will not syphon the water 
out of the traps. It usually does this because the rush of 
water creates a momentary vacuum into which the water of 
the traps is forced by the atmospheric pressure behind it. 
This air-pipe, when introduced, supplies air to the vacuum, 
and so prevents syphoning and its consequent ill effect of a 
trap without water, which leaves an open passage for sewer 
gases.

But, after all, it remains true that all the modern systems 
of interior drainage are liable to imperfection. There will 
be some putrefaction, and, consequently, some development 
of those insidious germs of disease now known so surely to 
lie at the foundation of all contagion and infection. To hit 
the death-blow to these, or indeed to prevent their ever 
coming to vitality, an apparatus known as the " Germicide " 
(germ-killer) has been invented, and is strongly indorsed.

as indicated. The chain H, attached to the closet-Hd, passes 
over the pulley I, actuates the plunger K, causing it to enter 
the thymol compartment L whenever the closet-lid is opened 
and to be withdrawn whenever the lid is closed. The plun- 
ger, being clothed with an absorbent, becomes saturated 
with thymol solution when lowered, and when raised liberates 
thymol vapor through the circular aperture G. 

The Germicide requires no attention whatever from the 
inmates of the house, as it is always under the supervision 
of the Company's uniformed, experienced inspectors. The 
appliance remains always the property of the Company, and 
is! placed for service at such an annual rental for inspection 
and supply of chemicals as to bring it within the means of 
the most humble householder. It is neatly encased in black 
walnut and is attached without interference with the plumb- 
ing of a house. Germicide Companies are located in New 
York, Cincinnati, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, etc. 

!0n the need of a disinfecting agent in every drainage sys- 
tem of a house, Professor Joseph C. Richardson, of the 
University of Pennsylvania, thus speaks : 

j" The true method of obviating this danger is by steriliz- 
ing with slow currents or drippings of solutions of sulphate 
of iron, corrosive sublimate, arsenic, carbolic acid, etc., the 
whole interior of our waste-pipes, just as the shores of the 
Dead Sea and the banks of certain small streams are steril- 
ized by mineral ingredients or poisonous metallic substances 
from manufacturing refuse, with which their waters are 
mingled. ... I am confident that the key to this momen- 
tous problem of how to avoid infection from ' sewer gas,' or, 
more correctly, sewer air, entering our dwellings, is to be 
found in the principle of so sterilizing the whole interior of 
all pipes communicating with sewers, and, if possible, of the 
sewers themselves (by frequently irrigating them with fluids 
containing metallic compounds poisonous to plant life), that 
no vegetable organisms can propagate within them."

Nothing worth having is to be had without expense either of time or 

money, but many of the best things in house decorating and furnishing are 

those that cost least. 

Clarence Cook.

IT is true that " Home is where the heart is." But some 
hearts are low in their tendencies, and are satisfied to 
tarry where others find no rest. There are hearts of 
refined quality and lofty aspiration. These dwell among 
life's better and nobler things. The best is none too good 
for them. They " covet earnestly the best gifts," and as 
opportunity allows they add one and another of these best 
things to their personal possessions. 

Some have a passion for clothes ; some for jewelry ; some 
for books ; but the true housewife desires that her home, 
" be it ever so humble," shall at least be clean, neat, and 
tasteful. She asks how others live ; how the homes of 
those more favored of fortune are furnished ; how her own 
little abode may be made more home-like, more lovely, 
more cozy. Such questions deserve answer. 

Decoration has more to do with many homes than the 
furnishing has. It puts the finishing touches on the furnish- 
ing. It embellishes the home. But furnishing can lay a 
good foundation for decoration. It can prepare the way 
splendidly. 

Forms of beauty may be introduced into every part of a 
house. Standard furniture is everywhere made with this idea 
in view. Every furniture store of any advancement shows 
it. The time was when the " Cottage " sets led the market.

These were sold at low prices, and they were in many cases 
really beautiful. The coloring and decoration, as well as 
the lines of the work, were artistic. They formed a good 
basis fo-r decoration.

turned work, molded work, and carved work, sometimes 
running the cost of a bed-room suite to ten, twelve, and 
fifteen hundred dollars. The special furniture combines all 
these resources of the art, and adds special taste, artistic 
study of effects, the combining of the truly beautiful with 
the really useful.

Corresponding with these glasses and racks are hall tables

are cane and umbrella racks. An ordinary table with a 
heavy covering or a plain cloth, if desired, may stand beneath 
tliese racks.

Passing into the house from the hall or entry-way, the 
parlor naturally receives the first attention. As managed 
in the average American home, this is the most costly and 
the least useful of all rooms. The cabinetmaker usually rules 
here and sways his sceptre with unquestioned supremacy. 
Whatever works of art or objects of beauty creep into these 
parlors are ill-assorted, if of value, though they are more fre-

give honest hard-wood furniture, beautifully fashioned and

and in many cases a good painting or two by a reputable

pieces of statuary are ranked as works of art and are freely 
admitted where good taste holds sway.

bric-a-brac, or good curiosities, though neither of these 
must be overdone. The parlor is neither a library nor a

books which charm 
by their beautiful

styles employed in upholstering furniture. It should har- 
monize and beautify both the wood used and the carpets 
laid. Cherry and mahogany furniture is not best set off by 
crimson reps or damasks, nor are ebony and black walnut 
best shown by dark coverings. Light and bright colored 
woods show best with dark and rich colored goods, while 

the darkest woods best display 
the brightest colorings and 
textures. 

If the walls are papered, it 
must be with due regard to 
the other appointments of the 
room. Such combinations as 
will make all the contents of 
the room help each other 
should be sought out. Where 
many paintings adorn the 
walls, the papering must be 
rich but subdued in colors. 
The finest work of art may be 
killed by the flashy back- 
ground on which it is hung. 
Where there are but few pic- 
tures, or where engravings 
alone appear, the paper may 
take on rich forms and colors, 
but it should never run to 
excess. Loud, glaring, flashy 
styles may be suitable for 
public places, but they are 
not for cozy homes. To secure 
what is right, consult your best paper-hanger ; try samples ; 
do not decide at once or off-hand ; weigh the subject; sleep 
over it ; thus you will probably reach a decision that will be 
a permanent satisfaction.

Now that this company-room, or best living-room as it 
had better be considered, is carpeted and papered, what 
furnishing shall it contain ? Sofas and chairs? Yes, but 
not of stiff, uncomfortable, regulation patterns. A neat 
lounge is preferable to a stiff sofa. Even the old-fashioned 
wooden settees can be made really comfortable by cushions 
on the seat, against the back, and on the ends. These should 
be of brightly colored 
goods ; chintz will do, 
though reps, cretonnes, 
or special goods are 
better. Do not stuff 
the cushions with cut 
straw or any other 
substance that will shift 
position and leave one 
sitting on the hard 
wood directly ; but use 
fine corn husk or some 
other cheap material, if 
not disposed to procure 
hair. Make the cush-

but it is made oblong also in two sizes, and in mahogany, 
ebony, walnut, and ash. For the ornamental covers now so 
generally used on tables, this style is specially adapted. It 
is entirely free from the top-heavy appearance and unstable 
condition of many ornamental tables in general use.

We have also shown a highly ornamental carved pedestal, 
on the upper stage of which a piece of statuary may be

On the lower stages other ornaments may be placed, with 
books, flowers, or bric-a-brac, as necessity may require or 
as taste may suggest. 

Similar in purpose, but of far lighter construction, is the 
Jardiniere stand. For floral displays, card receivers, statu-

more into vogue also, so that this construction is fully up

When books are displayed in a parlor or sitting-room, 
the large ones may lie upon the table, but the smaller ones 
should be placed in book-racks which hold them in position 
neatly with their backs upward. Two of these racks are 
shown in cuts given above. The ornamental ends of the 
racks turn upward upon hinges and are capable of longitu- 
dinal extension, so that few books or many, as may be 
required, can be held in proper position by this means. 
They are entirely in style.

A fine corner-fur- 
nishing for a parlor is 
secured in an ornamen- 
tal easel, one of which 
in very beautiful form 
is shown in the accom-

the easel implies a 
picture or handsome 
engraving to rest upon 
it. Because of this 
use, an easel should be 
of dark wood, orna- 
mented only in the 
matter of carving, so 
that it shall not present 
any dominating or de- 
tracting colors in com- 
parison with a picture 
which may rest upon it. 

Easels are some- 
times finished with a 
portfolio or pocket at 
the lower part in which 
engravings may be 
kept. When it is de- 
sired to show these, 
they are placed upon 
the shelf above the

returned to the pocket 
for safe keeping. This

A library or reading-room should be studiously fitted for 
its purpose. All glaring colors should be avoided as inju-

fancy colored leather attached to the edge of the shelf, and 
hanging a little below it, so as to reach the tops of the

apt to curl up and fail of its purpose. It is better to use a

mental articles may be placed. The lowest shelves of 
the cases are best wrought into a row of drawers, as dust 
from the floor soils books which are so near it. Whether 
a table or a desk be preferable depends on the leading pur- 
pose for which the room is used. A cylinder desk which 
may be entirely closed is best where private papers are 
liable to be dis- 
turbed. For most 
home uses, how- 
ever, this is not 
needful. 

Carpeting, pa- 
per-hanging, cur- 
tains, and other 
accessories of the 
room should be 
in keeping with 
its general pur- 
pose and plan. If 
there is a low- 
down grate or fire- 
place, it should be 
done in tiles. The 
mantle should be 
of carved wood 
to match the fur- 
niture, surmount- 
ed with light shelving at either end for books and orna- 
ments. A mirror may be placed over the centre. Restful 
chairs, a comfortable lounge, a student's lamp, and such 
appliances find appropriate places in this room. 

The library may be combined with the ladies' sitting-room, 

unless it is needed as a real study. If devoted to the double 

use, a ladies' workstand, such as has already been shown, 

is quite in place. This is suitable in any room where it will

serve as a convenience. Hanging cabinets or brackets, which 
are abundantly illustrated in previous pages, are admissible 
in the library. Their contents are illustrative of beauty and 
art. They are object lessons on topics which many books 
in the library are fairly presumed to discuss. The scrap- 
basket on some of the beautiful patterns illustrated under 
home decoration is appropriate in the library. Wall pockets 

and pocket easels are numer- 
ous and beautiful, and they, 
too, naturally belong here. 
% As receptacles of newspapers, 
letters, etc., they are just in 
place. But they must not be 
allowed to degenerate into 
rubbish holders. They may 
gather papers for a week, or 
some such short period, but 
they must be overhauled fre- 
quently, or they will offend 
good taste, which is always 
allied to neatness. 

A rich wall bracket, or a 
corner bracket, is admissable 
in any room, and maybe used 
for many purposes. Our illus- 
trations of these embody the 
stag's head. Uniformity in the pattern of brackets for a 
given room may be followed, or, with equal propriety, it 
may be disregarded. Nor is it important in the incidental 
decorations of a room that the prevailing wood of the furni- 
ture be followed. Variety may be admitted with all readiness, 
provided that it is not carried to the extent of evident 
and glaring incongruity. 

Concerning the dining-room, a fine writer on domestic 
affairs speaks thus ; " Probably there is no better test of

The central object of the dining-

the extension principle, and between 
meals it should be covered with a 
rich colored cloth. To set the table for 
the next meal as one is cleared away 
may save labor, but it savors of un- 
tidiness, for the dust must gather upon cloth and dishes in 
the interval. True, the laid table may be covered to pro- 
tect it. Dining-room 
chairs should be cov-

differing tastes. More coloring is admitted to the dining- 
room papers than elsewhere, because high colors in their 
decorations are not deemed best. Engravings, carvings, 
statuary, and paintings in some cases, are admitted to elegant 
dining-apartments. Some disapprove of the introduction of 
subjects connected with food, such as game, poultry, fruit, 
etc., in dining-room decorations, but good usage holds to 
this line, nevertheless, and with eminent fitness.

In the superb dining-hall of the Lick House, of San 
Francisco, art has done its best. Columns, carvings, stained

Immense pictures of Pacific coast scenery fill the panels

undoubtedly a superb hall, but no guest can appreciate the 
display as he sits at his own seat, and no refined guest 
wishes to be craning his neck this way and that, to see all 
these gems of the painter's art. Nor does a lover of art 
wish to parade around the room and study the pictures

while others are at their meals ; nor does he wish so to do 
while the servants are preparing the room and the tables 
for the meals. The fact is, that in this sumptuous room art 
has gone astray. A dining-room is not a picture gallery. 

The conspicuous piece of furniture in a dining-room is 
the sideboard or buffet. Its possibilities are well-nigh 
illimitable. Ancestral plate, if there be any, may repose 
here in its venerable dignity. If you have none such, bright 
china, glassware, lacquer work, and natural fruit or flowers 
will do full well. It is worth while to study effect in this 
article of furniture, for it is the one article at which your 
guests will look. A wooden 
top to your buffet is safer for 
the glassware than one of 
marble. Valuable glass and 
china will inevitably be chipped 
and marred if set frequently 
upon marble. 

When a meal is in progress 
good taste allows the finger 
bowls to stand ready for use 
on the buffet. Each should 
be on a plate with a small

bright and beautiful, are now in style, and they ornament 
the buffet very richly. High glass dishes cut into diamond 
points are also highly ornamental, especially if the buffet be 
well lighted, which it should be. Natural flowers are a wel- 
come adornment on the buffet as well as upon the table, but 
they should be very choice and of delicate odor. 

The gas-fixtures or lamps of a dining-room go far to 
beautify it. An unending variety is at command, with all 
shapes and colors of shades or globes, and untold variety in 
the fixtures themselves. Be careful even in the choice of a

table lamp, for these can be had in forms of exquisite 
beauty. Terra-cotta lamp stands, beautifully embossed and 
colored, are now exceedingly popular. Lamp shades are 
sold in a variety of hues, or white shades are covered with 
tasty paper covers, so that inexpensive decoration is within 
the reach of all, even though they shrink from the more 
costly articles.

constant annoyance. Marble tops cost more than others. 
They are liable to injure brittle objects which may be set 
upon them, and the style now is to entirely cover the top 
with various lace goods and other materials of fine texture 
and beautiful color. Wood, hence, is preferable to marble. 

Have a good spring bed covered by a mattress of hair. 
This may cost more at the outset, but it will last long and 
give constant satisfaction. Considering that about one-third 
of life is spent in bed, it is worth while to make the bed the 
best possible. Then, too, our hours of suffering are spent 
there, and there we expect to die. 

In getting up a mattress do not have it in one great mass. 
Do not have it in two long sections, either, as a joint down 
the middle never answers well. Make it in two parts — one 
the square of the bedstead's width, the other to occupy the 
remaining space. The square part can readily be turned 
in the bedstead, so that each side of it shall in turn be at 
the head of the bed. It may then be shifted to the foot 
and the smaller section come to the head. Each part may 
be turned over also, so that a new combination may be 
made each month for a year, and the gullies usually worn 
in mattresses may be wholly avoided. 

Quiet colors are best for the bed-room, both in carpets 
and on the walls. No object should be admitted there that 
is not an object of beauty. What the eye catches last at 
night and first in the morning, what it dwells on continu- 
ously in sickness and exhaustion, should be an object in- 
spiring peace, good-will, and placid joy. Heavy curtains or 
shades are needed at the windows, that light and heat and 
noise maybe excluded when one is sick or needs to sleep in 
daytime. All that is in the sleeping-room should be neat and 
beautiful. Beautiful forms are no more costly than those 
which are homely, and they pay far better, for Keats has 
truly said: 

" A thing of beauty is a joy forever."

Utility may also be happily blended with beauty. What 
could be more beautiful as an article of furniture than 
the . parlor cabinet here shown. It contains shelves and 
spaces for ornaments. The carved work is in the highest

pany comes upon you. Or you have not the bedroom you

board is disclosed, and all is ready for the making up of the 
bed. The inside measurement of this sumptuous place of 
rest is fifty-two inches by seventy-six. The outside measure-

This is the Champion Automatic Bedstead of Hale & Kil-

and at various prices. 

But a bedstead does 
not furnish a bed-

beauty of any parlor. Both these stands -are furnished by 
the manufacturers last named.

What they consider as their masterpiece, however, is 
known as the "Telescope Bedstead." When opened out it 
is as complete as that shown a few pages back. When 
closed it appears in various forms. The movement in open- 
ing this bedstead is simply a turning down of the lower 
part of the front so that it lies parallel with the floor. The 
slab or top becomes the foot-board, supported by the side

into position as supporting feet. The part thus formed is 
then drawn outward to secure the full length, leaving a 
bedstead of full size, with spring bed, hair mattress, and 
bolster complete, and of the best quality. 

These bedsteads are made in the Chiffonier, or bureau 
style ; the desk style, bevel fronl and cylinder front ; the 
sideboard style, the book-case style, and the organ style.

The book-case style varies in height from the others, and 
in several respects combines more advantages than any of 
the line. Its desk and its book-shelf are both of practical 




value, and its gen- 
eral appearance is ' 
possibly less sugges- 
tive of a variety of 
uses than in the other 
styles. 

The articles last 
described belong to a class 
known as " Combination Fur- 
niture." There is scarcely a 
limit to the possibilities of 
such articles. Tables are made 
which can be converted into 
armchairs and writing-desks ; 
children's high chairs are to 
be transformed into low chairs 
with table attachments ; ottomans can be changed into settees 
and armchairs ; an armchair can be adapted for an invalid 
couch or a library chair with reading-stand, writing-desk, etc.; 
and so through unending varieties. The climax in combi- 
nations is capped, however, by a New York cabinetmaker,

who has exhibited a Secretary, which combines a bedstead, 
writing-desk, bookcase, washstand, wardrobe, medicine-chest, 
secret silver-closet, dressing-bureau, jewelry-case, and, as a 
finial to the whole, a musical and alarm clock. Such a com- 
bination would need a machinist to run it. It is overdone. 

A nursery, or play-room, is indispensable where there are 
children in a home. It should have a hard wood floor, 
with a drugget or rug fastened at its centre. This can be 
removed easily for shaking or washing. Have no curtains 
or drapery in the room. Plain, dark shades will be best at 
the windows, so that light may be excluded wholly or 
admitted freely, as is desirable. A long, low table, the feet 
of which can be folded under, allowing the table to be placed 
out of the way, is just the thing for this room. Toys, books, 
strings, paper, pencils, and a good clock are needed. Have 
low chairs for the little ones as well as higher ones for the 
adults. Hang bright, cheery pictures on the walls. A 
blackboard and an assortment of colored crayons make lots 
of fun for children. Furnish one room at least where the 
little ones may romp at full liberty. 

Easy chairs and good, comfortable lounges are in place 
almost everywhere. Do not be misled into purchasing the 
stiff, hard, cylindrical affairs on which one can neither sit 
or lie with comfort. Study the picture of a comfortable 
lounge, shown on the preceding page, and get one on that 
principle. The best furniture now shows little or no wood. 
What you save in fancy woods and polish, you can spend 
in upholstery. Try it. Make home so bright, so restful, so 
homelike that no place shall be like home. 

Servants' rooms should be light and well ventilated. 
Good servants will not be satisfied with mean quarters. 
Iron bedsteads are recommended for these rooms but abso- 
lute cleanliness is more important. A bath-room for ser- 
vants is very desirable. Many of them never knew the 
luxury of a thorough bath. 



FOURTH DEPARTMENT. 



Home Decoration. 



To make home what it should be — a cheerful, happy habitation, to which 
the absent members of a family may look with love, and to which the wan- 
derer will always return with joy — we must have it not only clean, for clean- 
liness is next to godliness, and wholesome, which is another way of saying 
holy, but also beautiful. Refinement cannot go witH sordidness and ugliness.

Home Decoration. 



NEVER before was there so general an interest in the 
decoration of homes as there is to-day. A truer con- 
ception of what home should be is everywhere pre- 
vailing. It is not a mere barracks, where a family may 
congregate and sleep and eat, but it is a place of enjoyment 
and repose. To this end it must be filled with enjoyable 
and restful things ; and the enjoyment and rest must rise to 
something better than the physical. The best powers of 
the soul must be delighted as they repose at home. Noth- 
ing which offends can be tolerated there. Beauty — which 
in the old Roman tongue was decor — is home's presiding 
genius. To decor-2X<s^ home is to bring it under beauty's sway. 
Beauty means fitness, because it always rests upon a basis 
of utility. It is never unmeaning, but can always give a 
reason for its being. The first consideration, hence, is : 
What is good for certain persons, places, and seasons ? 
What is beautiful in a palace is not so in a cottage ; what is 
beautiful at a feast is not so at a funeral. Beauty and fitness 
ever go hand in hand. 

Decorations may be fixed, forming part and parcel of the 
house itself; or they may be portable — capable of change 
in position or of entire removal. There are internal decora- 
tions and those external, and all these need attention. 

423 



I.— FIXED INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 



IN treating of permanent decorations, floors first demand 
attention. What shall we do with our floors ? Floors 
are not merely to walk on. They should please the eye 
continually. Carpeting and oil-cloths have been the time-

honored devices for beautifying floors, or, at least, for con- 
cealing their unsightliness. But changes have come in 
these usages. 

ELEGANT FLOORING. 
Beginning with the outer vestibule, or main hallway, of a 
house, oil-cloth once reigned supreme. But oil-cloth fails.

Its colors are soon worn off. It becomes puffed into ridges 
and it shrinks from the surroundings. It is at best only a 
patch, a sham. Three superior substitutes for it are now 
offered : 

(i) Marble is used either in one uniform piece, or with 
borderings of other color ; or it may be cut into squares, 
diamonds, etc. Noth- 
ing for a hall or vesti- 
bule can be superior to 
marble. The material 
and its style may be 
plain and quite inex- 
* pensive, or they may 
be of the richest 
grades, as shown on 
page 424, with sur- 
roundings of carving 
and sculpture, which 
run the cost into tens 
of thousands of dol- 
lars for a single en- 
trance-way. Wain- 
scoting should be in 
harmony with the 
flooring. One motive

builder started with a grand idea, but ran out of funds 
and finished in a cheap way. The above illustration is 
not a pattern that many will imitate, but it is a model of 
harmony. Marble is the one rich material, and elegance 
breathes in every feature. Wooden balusters and handrail 
on this marble stairway would be a disgraceful incon- 
sistency. Unity of purpose must prevail. 




426 



THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 



(2) Tiling and mosaic work take rank with marble, and 
may surpass it in cost. The most beautiful tiles in the world 

arethe Minton. These 
are of English manu- 
facture, and are han- 
dled in this country 
by two agencies only, 
Miller & Coates, of 
New York, and Sharp- 
less & Watts, of Phila- 
delphia. The surfaces 
of these tiles are 
glazed, enameled, or 
plain. They are made 
in all desirable colors 
and shapes. Some 
are embossed, others 
printed, and the finest 
are painted by hand. 
Tiles are suitable for 
vestibules, hallways, 
•wainscoting, hearths, 
facing and lining fire- 
^ places and mantels, for 
bath-room walls and 
^"-^I^^^ B floors, for flower- 
boxes, panelings of 
doors, and ornaments 
in door casings. The 
choicest of them may 
be framed richly and 
serve as superb wall 
pictures. The decora- 
tive uses to which tiles are put are practically numberless. 
Mosaic work differs from tiling in the smallness of its

FLOORS.

427 



pieces and the consequent increase of possibilities for artistic 
effects in their use. Its cost is proportionately greater, of 
course. There are many grades of tiles and mosaics, but 
the best will last a lifetime, and are worth all they cost. 

(3) Inlaid floors are just the thing for dining-rooms and 
other much-used and more public rooms of the house. 
This work may be elaborate and very expensive, or it may 
be plain and of low price. Three methods of preparing 
these floors are followed. The first employs the ordinary 
tongued and grooved boards, laid diagonally or in other 
patterns ; the second kind is made of pieces, usually seven-

eighths of an inch thick, cut and fitted together in blocks of 
any desired patterns, in sections usually twelve or twenty- 
two inches square; the third method is to make up the 
design required from lumber one-quarter of an inch thick, 
glue the edges together, and then glue this pattern to a 
backing of hard wood. These are called veneered floors, 
and this is the style used in all elaborate designs, as it 
admits of much greater variety of patterns than either of 
the other methods. In Europe all such floors are known 
as Parquetry, or Marquetry, and their use is universal in 
the better houses. 



428 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



A much cheaper and very satisfactory substitute for these 
forms of fancy floor-work is " Wood Carpeting," an inven- 
tion of Mr. E. C. Hussey, an American architect. Its owner

and manufacturer is Mr. John W. Boughton, of Philadelphia. 
It is not, as many suppose, a temporary floor covering, to 
be laid down and taken up at pleasure, but a permanent new 
floor on top of the old one, and is carefully fitted into all the

offsets and around all the projections of the room. It is

in the same elaborate and beautiful designs by the process 
of gluing" the wood on cloth, instead of to another piece of 



430 



THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 



wood. So it Is made at a much less cost, and occupies but 
one-quarter of an inch, instead of one inch or more in thick- 
ness, as with thick Parquet. 

The common remark, " A bare floor is so cheerless," 
comes wholly from the impression given by an ordinary 
pine floor with its unsightly cracks, and from not having 
seen the effect of a well-laid Parquet floor, in combination 
with the furniture and other articles in keeping with the 
character of the room in which it is laid. 




SCINDE RUG FOR FLOOR CENTRES. 
[Characterized by borders with angular vine work. Prevailing colors, red, yellow, and blue .J 

When rugs are used on the floor of a room — as is now 
the prevailing fashion — a border of wood only is laid, into 
which the rug fits exactly. Rug and border are about the 
same thickness, and so the rug is not liable to be displaced 
nor an unaccustomed foot to trip over it. There are three 
ways of finishing these floors. 

1st. By giving them a good soaking coat of " Parquet 
oil." This should be renewed at least once a month. 
Apply with a rag and wipe off as dry as possible. The 



FIXED INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 



431 



best substitute for " Parquet oil " is five parts of good, light 
mineral oil to one part of good, light Japan. 

2d. By putting on two or three coats of best white shellac 




with a brush. Plane, scrape, sand-paper, punch the nails 
and putty up in a most thorough manner before shellacing, 
and sand-paper lightly after each coat but the last. 



432 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



3d. By waxing. This is the European plan, and if per^ 
severed in, as there, is the best known finish for floors. Use 
pure white beeswax dissolved in best deodorized benzine 
with gentle heat, or in turpentine. Apply while warm to 
the floor with a rag, then polish with a heavy waxing brush 
thoroughly. The brush must be used often and well to get 
and maintain a good polish and the desired smoothness.

WOOD-CARPET FLOORING AND WAINSCOTING. 

Illustrations of wood-carpeting are given, though the fine 
effect of variously colored woods does not appear in a plain 
print. These floors should not be used in vestibules and 
halls, where they are exposed to the weather. Such places 
require marble or tiles which endure exposure and are ift 
nowise injured thereby. 

If these methods of beautifying are too expensive, the 
floors may be simply stained and polished. A cheap 



FIXED INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 



433 



method of securing a neat floor is to cover it tightly with 
mushn and to cover this with an unobtrusive wall-paper. A 
border may be run around the edge and a good coat of var- 
nish added. Dancing would mar such a covering ; but if 
rugs be laid in the places of hardest wear, it will serve well 
and last long. This plan is especially adapted to a music- 
room, where clear, distinct sounds are desirable. 

BEAUTIFUL WALLS. 

After the floors, the walls come in for consideration. 
When papers can be had 
at prices so low and in 
styles so elegant as now, 
bare, cold walls in white- 
wash or paint are inex- 
cusable. Indeed, they 
are extravagant — for 
better results can be had 
for far less expense. So 
elaborate have paper- 
hangings become that ^ 
they are in great part 
supplanting the fresco- 
work formerly so much 
used in elegant houses. 
Wall hangings are offer- 
ed at from eight or ten 
cents to twenty and 
twenty-five dollars a 
roll. Just now the pre- 
vailing taste is to the 
(juieter forms and col- 
ors. The following illustration of a ceiling decoration in 
paper is from one of the most artistic establishments of New 
York. The quiet elegance of its forms are seen at a glance

434 



TJIE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



and the color effects would heighten it greatly. The lead- 
ing producers of paper-hangings are sparing no pains to 
produce results which shall in all respects be artistic and 
:elegant. One house offered three prizes, respectively of 
^i,ooo, ;^500, and ;^250, for the best designs. The result 
was the selection of three offerings, all of them combining 
an idea from nature, a water idea, a beehive idea, etc., and 
all of them conspicuous for rich simplicity and artistic effect. 
As illustrative of beautiful frieze patterns, two selections 
from the choicest patterns now offered are shown in cuts 
above. An elegant Easter Lily pattern, by W. N. Peak, of 

New York, is shown 
also. But these are 
samples only. The 
variety is wide as the 
freaks and fancies of 
genius. Indeed, the 
genius of the past is 
laid under contribution 
also to beautify our 
19th-century homes. 
Antique forms are 
much in demand, and 

EASTER LILY PATTERN FOR FRIEZE. \\^q VCrV ruinS of the 

world have been scoured to furnish suggestions for modern 
decoration. The trouble with these strange forms is that it 
is hard to make them harmonious with the other appoint- 
ments of the room. If there is an Egyptian or Chinese or 
Japanese room wherein the peculiarities of these nations are 
the dominating motive, then you have an harmonious effect. 
Such a result is artistic. But a Japanese banner, on a Chi- 
nese paper, with a French ceiling, a Turkish rug, and 
American furniture, is too much of a mongrel to be in^ 
'dorsed by good taste. 

In fine wall decorations there are many specialties. Em-

bossed papers are well known, and they are constantly im-

among which is " Lincrusta -Walton " — a preparation of 
ground cork and linseed oil. This has the tenacity and 
flexibility of leather. It can be bent around any curve and 
it will endure the hardest wear. In its preparatory state it 
is subjected to heavy pressure under molded rollers, whereby 
its upper surface is brought out in bold relief, while its under

surface remains entirely smooth, so promoting its facility of 
adhesion to the wall. The relief-effect on this substance 
may be made very prominent. It also takes coloring beauti- 
fully and becomes as enduring as the wall itself It is the 
invention of Mr. Frederick Walton, an English architect, 
and is now made for this country at Stamford, Conn., and is 
sold by first-class paper-hangers everywhere. 

Lincrusta-Walton has been largely used, both abroad and 
in this country, in palaces, mansions, country houses,

theatres, hospitals, churches, hotels, clubs, and other public 
and private buildings ; also in yachts, in the vessels of the 
British Navy, and of the Cunard, Inman, White Star, British 
Indian, and other steamship lines. Wherever the effects of

addition to the ordinary methods of pleasing the eye by 
colors and lines. It is only necessary to see the interiors of 
grand French buildings, with their admirable moldings, or 
the Gothic carvings of Belgian town halls and old English 
cathedral choirs, to appreciate the unapproachable refine- 
ment and beauty of work in relief" 

The advantages of Lincrusta- Walton have been thus sum- 
marized : " For the interior decoration of houses its warm

and comfortable surface makes it peculiarly applicable. It 
has no glaze to break up and reflect the light with Ihe cold 
glitter of Dutch tiles, nor does the moisture of the air con- 
dense upon its surface, unless water is present in excessive 
quantities in the atmosphere. It is not warped, cast, eaten 
by worms, or pulverized like wood. It does not become 
ice-cold in winter and hot in summer, like stone and terra- 
cotta. It does hot absorb moisture and give it out again, 
like uncovered brick and plaster. On the contrary, it offers

an impermeable resistance to wet from within or without, 
and if the air within is so dangerously damp as to communi- 
cate moisture to the walls, Lincrusta- Walton does not con- 
ceal the effect by absorbing the moisture." 

A substance termed '* Gerveta" is coming into use for 
'high grades of decoration. Its general effects are like those 
of Lincrusta, but more bold and prominent, as Gerveta is 
applied to the walls in a pulpy state and is there worked by 
molds and tools. It may also be worked separately, though 
to work it on the wall is deemed preferable, securing more 
perfect adhesion and bolder effects. 

The substances just named have great possibilities in 
artistic hands. Paneled ceilings and covered walls ; doors 
and door-jambs inset with these preparations ; wainscoting 
and heavy furniture, similarly adorned ; fire screens, picture 
frames, newel posts, and lighter decorations, resplendent 
with a variety of patterns and colors, are some of the uses 
of these wares. Inquiry concerning these goods should be 
m^de by all parties interested in extensive or even incidental 
decorations. 

Fresco paintings were the dominant mural decorations of 
the world until a somewhat recent day. The artists of St. 
Peter's, St. Paul's, and other grand structures are immor- 
talized by that class of v/ork. It is seldom now that homes 
are frescoed throughout. Ceilings are often finished thus 
in part, or even entire, for the sake of the freedom and grace 
thus attainable. The best of papers must, to a great degree, 
be set and formal ; but in fresco there are no limits, save in 
the capacity of the artist or the purse of his customer. For 
home walls, at least, this art has suffered decline. More 
effective decoration can be had in other ways, especially for 
private houses. 

But the highest style of wall decoration demands some- 
thing more elegant than either paper or paint. Silks, satins, 
and laces fill this requirement. Silk or satin decorations

are attached to light frames, over which musHn is stretched 
as a basis. These frames fit the wall closely from wain- 
scoting to cornice. Silk may be stretched smoothly on 
these frames, or it may be fluted, or gathered to a central 
rosette, or worked in any other beautiful design. To pad 
the silk into a light cushion and tuft it is very elegant. 
This silk finish may remain uncovered, or, from a rod at the 
cornice. Gobelin laces or t^.^^ .>.... ,^v^. » v^^^-.:^v^ lu^^^ukuj; ^^^^^

The combinations of ma- 
terial, colors, and graceful 
forms which may be pro- 
duced in this style of work 
are numberless. The silks 
may be plain, watered, or 
figured ; they may be of 
one color or of many har- 
monizing colors in stripes ornamental moorish ceiling. 
of greater or less width. The laces may be of various quali- 
ties and patterns, and may hang free, or be draped apart in 
sections, or be fluted close to the foundation-silk or satin. 

Carving also lends its aid to the decoration of walls, ceil- 
ings, doors, door-jambs, window frames, etc. Papier-mache 
and stucco produce very satisfactory results in this direc- 
tion ; but imitations are not admitted in first-class mansions. 
Genuine hard woods, carved by hand, are required there.

Lamps, too, are wrought into very elegant forms. They 
may adorn as well as illuminate our homes, and are adapted 
for halls, parlors, and all other apartments. 

Stained-glass windows present one of the richest effects 

in ornam.entation. They 
have been in use since 
the sixth century, and 
have ever held their su- 
premacy with lovers of 
the beautiful. Objects 
presented by stained 
glass are shown by 
transmitted light in all 
the fullness and richness 
of their colors. Objects 
presented by reflected 
light, as when one views 
pictures and solid orna- 
ments, are to some ex- 
tent shorn of their rich 
coloring. The surround- 
ing white light produces 
somewhat of grayncss 
on all colors. To test 
this, notice the shade of 
a delicate leaf when seen 
only by reflected light ; 
then hold it between the 
eye and the sunlight so 
as to see its coloring by 
means of transmission. 
The fine effect of stained-glass windows is heightened by 
the dark lines of the sash-bars about the several pieces of 
glass. These serve to intensify the rich colorings, which 
diffuse through the apartment a warm, genial, brilliant glow.

The glass throughout a house should be made appropriate 
for its particular position, and so add a greater charm to 
such beautiful work. In the vestibule- doors, words of greet-

color being absent. 
Where a single piece of 
stained-glass work is 
wanted, nothing could 
be better than a hand- 
some fire-screen, which 
in the daytime catches 
the reflecting lights, 
and in the evening is 
lit up by the open fire- 
place. Such a piece is 
always handsome and 
never out of fashion.

to the householder, they offer one of the best means of 
making home attractive. A judicious expenditure for 
stained glass will prove the correctness of the old adage, 
"A thing of beauty is a joy forever." 




IJVIITATION STAINED-GLASS DESIGNS FOR TRANSOMS. 

The costliness of stained glass is a great objection to its 
use. This varies in proportion to the quality of glass used, 
richness of design, smallness of pieces, numerousness of 
"jewels," etc. For home uses, what is known as "Imita- 
tion Stained Glass" is a very satisfactory substitute. It is 
made of thin, translucent sheets of richly colored and 
elegantly designed papers, closely imitating the genuine 
stained glass. It is durable, inexpensive, and easily applied

to any window. It is covered by an American patent, and 
is represented by Frank E. Johnson, of New York, and by 
Sam'l Loag, of Philadelphia. Four outline designs of this 
preparation are given r^ 
to illustrate its styles. 
The transoms show 
combinations which 
may readily be 
worked into other 
forms. They are 
composed of borders, 
grounds, and centres, 
either of which can 
be used In an end- 
less variety of ways. 
The library window 
shows the combina- 
tion applied to the 
entire opening. The 
emblem of wisdom is 
appropriate here. In 
a dining-room win- 
dow, birds, fruits, or 
game would suit bet- 
ter. In a parlor, mu- 
sic and flowers, or the 
Muses, the Graces, 
etc., would be more 
at home. The panel 
pattern shown on the 
page next following 
is suitable for any 
door, being beautiful, but not of decided characteristics. 
A French preparation, " Diaphanie," is offered for the 
same purpose ; also, " Glacier," an American patented

article. In the Diaphanie French skill appears, and the 
designs are of great and beautiful pictorial variety, including 
coats-of-arms, religious subjects, landscapes, fruits, flowers, 

historic and chivalric subjects, 
etc., etc. Charles Mo.Uer & Co., 
of New York, are the American 
agents for Diaphanie. Glacier 
can be had of paint and glass 
dealers generally. Probably the 
best method is to combine these 
several preparations, selecting 
from each that which is best 
suited to the specific work pro- 
posed. Great opportunity for the 
exercise of good taste is afforded 
in the use of these materials. 

With home windows in the 
ordinary form, a very happy effect 
is produced by covering the up- 
per half with imitations of stained 
glass (unless, indeed, the genuine 
article be used), and then hanging 
the window shade for the lower 
half only. This shade should be 
dense and not brilliant in color, 
so that all the light of the room 
shall take its mellowing from 
the colors above. An upper shade 
may be used to exclude glare. 
The excellence of all stained glass 
effects depends on transmitting all the light. Reflected 
light always detracts from the beauty of stained glass.

II.— PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 

THERE are important decorations in the home which 
are not part of the house itself. They are personal 
property, not real estate. They are carried with their 
owner in his migrations and are adapted to each new 
resting place he may find. Of these we may discuss, first : 

CARVINGS, PICTURES, AND CURTAINS. 




RICHLY DECORATED APARTMENT. 



In the hallway there may be carvings, statuary, or vases. 
The stag's head or horns is much used in this situation —

rather too much, indeed. A buffalo's head is too heavy 
and beastly for a beautiful home. Armorial carvings are 
light and ornamental* as wall decorations, but real armor is 
better. In a hallway it is suggestive of romance ; for as we 
leave hats, canes, and riding-whips in the hall, ready for use 
as we pass out, so the olden knights left swords, helmets, 
and battle-axes there, ready to be used at a moment's 
notice. On the same principle, ancient arms or historic 
weapons may be there, though the peaceful home-tastes of 
most people prefer more quiet emblems. The Alpen-stocks, 
now so popular with mountain tourists, may properly rest 
with other trophies of travel in the main hallway. 





POLISHED BRASS UMBRELLA AND CANE STANDS. 

Ideal fitness must rule in all decoration. Because in 
conflict with it, pictures are rarely in place in hallways. 
You can seldom get a standpoint from which to view them 
properly, and it is a farce to locate pictures where their 
effect is lost. On this ideal fitness, the old family clock is 
properly placed in the hallway, where it may mark the 
incomings and the outgoings, and where it will sound out

the passing hours for all in the house. Longfellow, who, 
more than any of our poets, touched the heart and home- 
life of our people, had his old clock on the stairs and in 
his hall the bust of Washington, who once made his head- 
quarters in that very house. There are pictures in the 
hallway there and on the landings ; but they are little gems 
which need close 
observation, and 
can be fully seen. 

In the dining- 
room, decorations 
may be held to 
the five F's — 
namely. Fish, 
Flesh, Fowl, 
Fruits, Flowers. 
These may be in 
carved work or in 
paintings, either i'< 
fixed or movable. If 
mottoes are used on dm- 
ing-room walls, v/hich is by 
no means to be advised, do seek 
one different from " Eat, Drink; 
and be Merry," and other conven 
tional platitudes which are so 
comrnon in the cheap boarding-houses. 

In the sitting and sleeping 
rooms the eternal fitness oij^%

and pleasure are desirable 

here, and articles which promote them are always in order. 
But such articles have their own character, and should be 
located accordingly. There are articles for the parlor, 
others for the dining-room, and so throughout the house.

A piano is not for fit the bed-room, though a music-box 
may be allowed there. Nor are superb paintings for bed- 
rooms, but for more public places. Where there are many 
fine paintings, it is worth while to have a picture gallery or 
apartment where lovers of art may sit undisturbed and 
enjoy their favorites. Much of a collection of fine paintings 
is a luxury permitted to but few, as none but millionaires 
can hold the celebrated pieces. But from these costly 
works there is a gradually descending scale till the little,

inexpensive gems of true art — such as Prang, of Boston, 
furnishes — are reached. These are artistic and exquisite. 
They charm and elevate, and one such is worth far more 
than a roomful of daubs, such as wandering auctioneers and 
artistic tramps hawk about. 

A beautiful illustration of fitness in decoration is afforded 
in the music-room of a wealthy musical gentleman of Cin- 
cinnati. He has there a grand organ, two pianos, a cabinet 
prgan^ a harp^ and rnany other musical instruments, together

with pictures of the masters and curious musical instruments 
of other, days and lands. In the ground-glass transom of 
the entrance-door the opening strain of " Home, Sweec 
Home " is wrought. Over the 
grand organ the opening strain of 
the " Hallelujah Chorus " is fres- 
coed in the cove of the cornice, at 
other points of which snatches of 
other celebrated compositions are 
wrought so delicately as to escape 
casual observation, and yet so 
beautifully as to charm every artistic 
eye which catches them. 

All living things turn toward the 
light. The bright side of a room 
is that most seen. The parts next 
the windows are those for special 
effect. A mirror between windows 
is condemned by some critics. One 
says : " People of taste . . . some- 
times put mirrors in this spot. 
Philistines always . do." But the 
poorest light of the room is just 
there. An observer at that point is 
dazzled with the radiance on either 
side and cannot see clearly what 
stands between. A mirror there, 
however, reflects the illuminated 
objects of the room, and does so 
all the more from receiving no direct light itself Put a 
mirror between the windows, therefore. In front of it a 
piece of statuary will be seen to advantage by direct and 
reflected views. This may to some extent obscure the 
mirror, but in a parlor its use is not as a dressing-glass, 
but to beautify and enlarge the room. 




JARDINIERE STAND. 

[Metal, variously finished.] 



456 



THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y, 



In the front corners of the room, statuary, jardinieres with 
flowers, or any beautiful objects which are high, but not 
broad, are appropriate. Statuary should always be shown 

against a suitable background — very 
dark for white marble and bright 
colors for the Rogers' groups or 
other dark-colored pieces. 

When statuettes are used upon 
brackets , or cabinets, this principle 
must be observed. On ebony a pure, 
white ornament is splendid. Bronze 
shows to best advantage on white. 
Dark walls are best for gold frames 
and rich-colored paintings. 

Do not feel compelled to make 
each article of an apartment balance 
with some other article. Irregularity 
is more natural than regularity. The 
finest mosaics are purposely made 
irregular to avoid the " machine- 
made" appearance. Do not square 
your chairs with the walls ; do not 
set them at one inevitable angle. Do 
not keep things forever in one place. 
Nature is free in her forms and her 
movements, and the highest art 
walks lovingly with her. 
Changes in arrangement come from various demands. 
Persons weary of one style. " Variety is the spice of life." 
Even a less elegant change is preferable for a time to stolid 
grandeur. The march of improvement, too, demands 
change. Competition in fabrics of all kinds begets improve- 
ment. Better eoods come into the markets continuouslv, 
crowding out the old and the inferior and m.aking place for 
the new and the better.

It has become quite popular, and deservedly so on many 
accounts, to curtain doorways as shown in the cut. Where 

there are sliding 
doois they remain 
to be used when 
required. Hinged 
doors are usually 
removed entirely 
when curtains are 
employed. In an 
arched doorway 
the curtain should 
hang from a rod 
on a level with the 
spring of the arch ; 
unless, indeed, the 
opening lead into 
a cold apartment, 
from which chill- 
ing drafts might 
come. For such 
an opening, how- 
ever, a more solid 
door seems best. 
Rods and rings of 
polished wood are 
the proper articles 
for these uses. Metal rings are not now used with curtains. 
The material of the curtaining may be as varied as the 
tastes and purses of parties demand. Curtaining doorways 
is, however, a movement in the direction of luxury and 
beauty. It should express itself, therefore, in elegant, if 
not sumptuous, forms. 

Real elegance can assert itself in many ways. The 
carpetings, the wall papers, the curtains, the substantial

such surroundings there is a grand inspiration to personal 
elegance. Our surroundings and ourselves are part and 
parcel of one great whole. It is not we that make our 
surroundings merely, but our surroundings in turn make 
us. We are molded by the things we mold. The very 
act of fashioning beautiful forms forms us into beautiful 
fashion. And so the peep at elegance, as given in the cut, 
is without any inelegant detractions.

A pen picture of the private apartments of the President 
of the United States will be of interest. The sleeping-room

of His Excellency is a model of tasteful and rich furnishing. 
The curtains, carpets, portieres, and paper of this room are 
of a pale-blue tint, commonly known as pigeon-egg blue.

and the furniture, with the exception of the bedstead, 
corresponds with the other appointments. 

Adjoining this room is the private study of the President. 
Surrounded by books of choice engravings, photographs of 
intimate friends, and articles of vertu indescribable — a cozier 
nook could not have been selected, and the view on all sides 
is charming. 

Passing out of the study into a large hall, one is impressed 
by the magnificent surroundings. Several of the best works 
of Bierstadt adorn the walls, a large painting of the Yellow- 
stone region being the most striking. A unique and 
handsome cigar-stand, formed of the head of a Texas calf 
and three steers' horns, highly polished and mounted in 
silver, is placed near a favorite lounging-place of the Presi- • 
dent. A large, semi-circular window of French plate, 
surmounted by jeweled designs in glass, is at the end of 
this apartment, and the perfume of the choicest flowers in 
the conservatory beneath scents the air. Easy chairs, 
lounges, and tete-a-tetes are scattered through the hall and 
invite delicious rest from the affairs of state. 

A large, carved door opens from the hall into the bed- 
room at the southwest angle of the mansion, in which the 
late President Garfield suffered. A communicating door 
opens into the large room used by the doctors in attendance 
upon the stricken President. The most notable article in 
this apartment is a handsomely carved mahogany bedstead, 
bearing in bold relief the coat-of-arms of the United States, 
the whole surmounted by a heavy red silk canopy. A pair 
of steps lead up to the bed, upon which are four mattresses, 
topped off by a feather bed. The furniture of the room is 
of a heavy, sombre, antique pattern. This furniture is 
valued at thousands of dollars and is the only thing about 
the mansion which connects the past with the present. 

Another pen-picture, showing some of the elegancies of 
the house of William H. Vanderbilt — the grandest private 



PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS. .j(5l 

mansion of America — will be welcome. The hall is sixty 
feet deep by twenty wide. In the centre, upon the right 
side, is the grand staircase, down whose broad flight the 
daylight streams, mellowed through stained-glass Venetian 
windows. Opposite the staircase, in the hall, is a splendid 
fireplace. The andirons are of iron hammered into artistic 
shape and furnished with chains. Five torches, with wax 
candles, give brilliancy to the hall by night. The candles 
are held in bronze branches which -spring from bronze 
columns, up which Cupids climb. The walls are wainscoted 
with Caen stone, elaborately carved, the panels separated 
by classic pilasters and decorated with scroll work. A 
drapery of Oriental silk hangs above the stone-work, 
embroidered with figures of birds. The mantel-piece of this 
hall is a wondrous work of art, made of Caen stone and 
ornamented with superb carving. Looking from this fire- 
place up the staircase, the eye meets the twelve Caesars in 
two stained windows, each on topaz-colored medallions on 
a ground of ruby red. Between the two windows stand 
female saints in carved wood, with carved pedestals and 
arching canopies. The side-wall and the balustrade are of 
Caen stone, the balusters being of acanthus leaves termi- 
nating in dragons' heads. 

At the end of the hall is the dining-room, thirty-five feet 
wide and fifty-four feet long, its ceiling of dark, carved wood 
thirty-two feet above its floor. In a deep recess at the 
western end of the room is a stained-glass window of 
enormous size, representing the meeting of Henry VIII of 
England with Francis I of France. Four chandeliers hang 
from the groined ceiling. Here, too, is a huge fireplace of 
richly carved stone and terra cotta. The walls are covered 
with Venetian gilt and colored leather. A frieze above the 
mantel of the fireplace in the dining-room represents sea- 
nymphs and Cupid sporting in the waters and playing with 
sea-horses and seals. Above this is a solid work of carved oak.

The drawing-room is thirty-four feet wide by forty feet 
long. The walls are paneled in cream color, with gilt 
moldings, and on the doors hang hunting trophies of gilt. 
The doors once belonged to an old French chateau. The 
fireplace is of two marbles, super-ornamented with heavy 
bronzes. The ceiling is adorned with the fresco work of 
Baudry, of Paris, representing Olympus and its gods and 
goddesses. The ceiling is circular in form and the corners 
are filled with triangular panels, in which are figures of 
Cupid, A large mirror is set in the paneling above the

lights from the walls and two torches of white marble stand 
before the entrance. 

The Japanese room of this mansion is superb as the 
boudoir of an Oriental princess. The ceiling shows open 
rafters ; the upper portion of the walls is finished in bamboo, 
while around the lower portion is cabinet work, tinted in 
rich red lacquer. On each side of the door a life-size 
figure in Japanese costume holds aloft a magnificent cluster 
of lights. One of the grandest features of this sumptuous

room is its stained glass window. It represents flowers and 
birds, the main object being a peacock, the tail of which is 
pronounced a marvel of splendor and fidelity. 

DECORATIONS FROM NATURE. 

Home decoration owes an immense debt to flowers. These 
beautiful adornments are so fi-ee, so fragrant, so varied, 
and such favorites with, all, that every true home should 
be brightened by them. Granting that it be a city home, 
with no lawn, no trees, no extended flower beds, still, 
within the house, by a little skill and care, beauty may be 
made to smile the year through. While snow and sleet 
reign without, buds and blossoms may reign within. 

The cut below is a bright illustration of what may be in 
any home by careful window gardening. 




A window for flowers must 
be upon the sunny side of 
the house. Unless the sashes 
fit unusually tight, a double sash will be needed for 
the winter, as the winds will almost certainly penetrate 
the room and nip the tender plants. If the heat of the 



464 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



room fall off during the night, this danger will be greatly 
increased. And yet an arrangement must be made for an 
abundance of fresh air. Want of oxygen is as fatal to plants 
as to people. 

The equipment for such a window garden as this cut rep- 
resents are few, simple, and inexpensive. Hanging-baskets 
are innumerable in style and price, as will be illustrated in 
the pages beyond. Wire flower stands are very pretty, sub- 
stantial, and cheap. Flower-pots may be had in all styles. 
The old-fashioned earthern pots cost very little. It was 
once thought they were the only ones which, by virtue of 
their porous character, would effectually promote plant 
growth. But that idea was erroneous. You may paint the 
pots, so beautifying them even while you destroy their 
porosity ; or you may use any of the many forms of glazed 
and ornamented pots now offered at the stores. 




VARIETIES IN FLOWER-POTS. 

What actually has been done in Bay-window Gardening 
is shown in the next cut, which is from a photograph. The 
floor of this bay-window is finished in hard wood. This is 
desirable, as it allows free watering of the plants without 
damage to carpets. An oil-cloth covering, or a floor laid 
with tile, neither of which need cost much, answer well. It 
is a good plan to have a hard-wood floor laid upon the 



PORTABLE INTERNAL DECORATIONS. 



465 



regular floor, thus making the bay-window flooring sHghtly 
higher than the main floor. A tenant may make this por- 
table, so as to be easily removed, if need be. 




THE BAY-WINDOW GARDEN. 

The pots in this window are placed directly on the floor. 
The corner pots contain ivy vines, which are trained up the 
wood-work and across the window head with very pretty 
eflect. The strip on the floor, around the pots, is merely 
to give a good finish to the outline of the room. It may be 
movable or permanent, as is desired. The plants to be 
used must be. selected by advice of a florist, who knows the 
exact possibilities of the locality. Houses have peculiarities, 
also, which must be discovered. The purse, too, needs con- 
sultation, for from very inexpensive plants one may rise to 
those of finest character and highest cost. Birds, vases, 
hanging-baskets, and other elements of such gardens waI 
be discussed hereafter. One thing must be remembered, 
however, in this connection, namely : A bay-window gar-

den cannot be used for much else. It cannot be a play- 
ground, a smoking-room, or a lounging-place, though it 
makes a beautiful sitting-place for the ladies in their mo- 
ments of leisure. 

No advice as to the care of plants for a window gardea 
Vill apply everywhere. The best way is to consult local 
florists who are successful, and to observe carefully your 
own experiences. Generally speaking, the best flower for the 




SQUARE BAY-WINDOW GARDEN. 

house is the geranium. It requires but little care, is never 
troubled with green fly or red spider, stands a dry atmos- 
phere well, and blooms profusely. Heliotropes and bego- 
nias are easily grown and are good bloomers. Callas will 
grow well almost anywhere if they get plenty of water. The 
ivy is well fitted for use in the house. Fuchsias are exqui- 
site flowers for summer use, but do not bloom well in winter. 
For fall use nothing is better than the chrysanthemums. 
After these have blossomed the plants can be put in the

cellar. Carnations, abutilons, oleanders, and myrtles are all 
adapted to culture in the house, and generally give excellent 
satisfaction. It is always best to confine attention at first to 
such plants as are not too particular. When you can grow 
these well, try other kinds. Do not attempt too much, but do 

your best 

with what 

you start.

a treasure.

Surprising results

special care. The ad-

LILY OF THE VALLEY, FIVE WEEKS OLD. ley which Came to the 

condition here shown in five weeks. Of course, it had 
skillful and constant care, but it had no advantage of hot- 
house or special accessory. Its chief forcing was on the 
reservoir of a kitchen cook-stove. 

On the use of vines in the house an expert says : " There 
is nothing in the way of home decorations that may be had 
with so little expense, managed with so little trouble, or will 
give results so satisfactory, as the ivy. There is no room so

palatial to which it may not add embellishment, and it will 
give an air of cheerfulness and refinement to the one room 
of the settler's log-cabin. Of course, we refer to the true 
evergreen ivy, Hedera, and not to the tender plants known 
as * Parlor,' ' German,' * Colosseum,' and other ivies. If 
one has a sprig of ivy and a pot or a box of earth, wonders 
can be accomplished if the owner possesses one other requi- 
site — patience. The growth is slow at first, but it is in- 
creasingly rapid, and each year the plant will reward patient 

care by becoming more beautiful and 
more valuable." 

Boxes for window gardens, with 
casters for ease of movement, may be 
constructed by any person. One of 
the prettiest may be made by covering 
the box with pieces of bark nailed up- 
right on its sides, sawed off at the top 
and bottom edges, and then making 
the supporting stand and overarching 
trellis of saplings. Vine stems may be 
trailed over the rustic work and fast- 
ened there. The effect of growing 
flowers and vines on such a rustic 
stand is very beautiful. 

Some plants show to best advantage 
when separated from others and in positions not favorable 
for the display of ordinary plants. For example : For 
brackets the best plants we have are the drooping varieties 
of fuchsias, the eupatorium and begonias. No one knows 
what grace there is in the fuchsia unless he has seen it grow- 
ing on a bracket placed about as high as his head, the 
branches being allowed to droop over the pot. To secure 
plenty of branches, the centre of the plant should be pinched 
out when it is small. Where one stalk was there will be 
two shoots thrown out. These, in turn, should be pinched

back, and at least a dozen thrifty stalks should be induced 
to grow from the base of the plant. No piece of statuary 
can make a more elegant filling for a corner. Eupatorium 
Mexicanum blends beautifully with fuchsias on two-pot 
brackets, and the effect is more than, 
doubled if placed in front of a mirror. 
One of the most tasty decorations 
is a bouquet or basket of flowers, or 
even a single beautiful rose, lily, or 
hyacinth. Small vases for these can 
be had in abundance at all prices. 
Miniature gypsy kettles, with flowers 
of delicate form and size, are exceed- 
ingly beautiful on a mantel or bracket. 
Artificial flowers may be used thus, 
but they must be small and exquisite, not large or gaudy. 

To "make a bunch of flowers" is no trouble, but to make 
a bouquet or tastefully fill a basket of flowers is a high art. 
Arranging flowers loosely and naturally in vases, saucers, 
and other ornamental receptacles requires 
good taste and some knowledge of the 
harmony of colors. To fill a basket, first 
line it with tin foil, or scatter a little lyco- 
podium or other green material, to form 
H! a lining. Over this put a lining of strong 
fc paper. Then fill the basket with damp 
sawdust, rounding it off at the top and cov- 
ering with damp moss, inserting the stems 

of the flowers in the moss. If the natural 

VASE FOR FLOWERS, stems are not suitable for this work, the 
flowers can be " stemmed," that is, fastened to small pieces 
of wood or broom splints. It is well to make the border 
of drooping green. Fuchsias border very elegantly. 

Few flowers have stems suitable for bouquet work ; so it 
is the custom to " stem " all flowers for this purpose. These

stiff steams can be made to hold the flowers in any position 
desired. To keep the flowers from crowding each other 
, and to supply moisture, wind damp rrfoss 

around the stem at its connection with the 
artificial stem. The central flower, which 
should be the largest, must have a stiff, 
strong, straight stem, which really forms the back- 
bone of the bouquet as well also as the handle. 
Fasten the stems of all the smaller flowers around 
this main, central flower. After the flowers are all 
properly attached and the bouquet is well formed, 
cut off the entire handle to the desired length and 
cover it with tin-foil, or wind it with white ribbon, 
leaving a loop, so that the bouquet may be sus- 
pended by it if desired.

small cost which will cover the handle and bot- 
tom of the bouquet and also make a richly ornamental 
border. These hints apply, of course, to hand bouquets, 
but larger bouquets are 
made in the same manner, 
except that they are more 
pyramidal in form. 

If ferns or flowers for ornamental bouquet paper. 

bouquets or other work are laid in water for several hours 
after being cut and before they are used, they will endure 
much longer without flagging than if immediately arranged. 
The more water they absorb after being severed from the 
plant, the better they will stand. 

A new device for the arrangement of flowers consists of a 
piece of cork about a quarter of an inch thick, circular in 
form, and perforated with holes, like the rose of a watering- 
pot. The diameter of the cork is made to correspond to 
the size of the saucer or shallow dish with which it is to be 
used. The cork, floating on the top of the water, supports 




DECORA TiONS FR OM NA TURE. \1\ 

the flowers, whose stems are inserted through the holes. 
For the display of small flowers and those having short 
stems this method is well adapted. It may possibly be 
better than damp sand, as the cork may be preserved and 
will always be ready, even when sand cannot*be had. 

The Ladies' Floral Cabmet lays down the following rules 
on bouquet-making : " Never put more than three varieties 
or colors in the same vase or bouquet, and let those colors 
be such as perfectly harmonize. Arrange the flowers so 
that each one can be seen entire." This is good, but 
exceptions are numerous. 

Autumn leaves, which are a deservedly popular decora- 
tion, require but little preparation. When fully ripe they 
contain very little moisture and the colors are quite perma- 
nent ; but they contain some moisture, and may curl up if 
brought into a warm room. To prevent this, place them 
between papers, giving a light pressure. In a few days take 
them out and give a light dressing of varnish to brighten 
the colors. For this purpose, clear, boiled linseed oil is 
good, using the least possible amount Some prefer balsam 
fir, cut with alcohol ; others use gum shellac dissolved in 
alcohol ; others dip each leaf in melted wax and press it a 
moment with a warm iron. 

It is stated that the colors of flowers may be preserved by 
dipping them occasionally in a boiled solution of eleven 
grains of salycilic acid in a pint of water and afterward care- 
fully drying them between sheets of blotting papen 

There are several methods of drying flowers so as to 
preserve their color to some degree. The most common 
way is to spread them in a pan of dry sand and sift sand 
upon them, keeping them, when thus covered, in a warm, 
dry place for several days, until free from moisture ; or they 
may be dried between thin sheets of wadding placed be- 
tween two pieces of glass. The pressing will injure the 
form ; but this is more or less so by any process.

The field for ingenuity and taste here opened is very 
broad and is well worth diligent cultivation. 

Floral or evergreen letterings are often desired. Mark 
out the letters on strawboard, placing them close together, 

as in diagram No. i. If no 
expert in lettering is available, 
determine the height you wish 
the letters to be, and divide that 
into six equal parts, marking 
these on the strawboard. Cross 
these with other lines at the 
same distances apart. The pro- 
portions so given will answer for most letters, six spaces

the proportions for others, as in dia- 
gram No. 2. 

When thus marked, cut each letter 
clearly with shears or knife, and cover ^ j 

them by tying with dark thread or sewing the green and 
flowers to the surfaces. Keep the work even and trim its 
edges when done. Everlasting flowers or bright berries 
should be mixed with the green to relieve the uniformity. 
Moss may be tied upon the letters ; into this flowers with 
paste or glue upon their stems may be stuck, and they will 

remain fixed, showing a 
result as in diagram No. 3. 
Glue will hold some cover- 
ings of letters sufficiently. 
Immortelles, Pampas

many weeds and grasses, are well suited for drying. Vases, 
baskets, and wall-pockets may be filled with them and 
serve well as decorations. The unnatural coloring frequently 
put upon these grasses by dealers is a monstrosity. Better 
retain the natural conditions when natural objects are used.

It consumes time, but it cultivates taste. 

A few little floral fancies are worthy of

it well and keep it in the dark until it has begun to sprout ; 

keep it damp, and move it into the light when the leaves 

appear. If the cultivation is successful, an ornament pretty 

enough for any room will be the result. 

4. Take a sound turnip and clean the outside, taking care 

not to injure the part from whence the leaves spring. Cut 

a piece off the bottom 
and scoop out the 
inside. Fasten string 
or wire to it, so that 
it can be hung up. 
Fill the cavity, and 
keep it filled, with 
water. In a short 
time the leaves will 
sprout and curl up 
toward the ball of the 
turnip, forming a 
beautiful miniature 
hanging-basket.

6. A transparency of dried flowers may be made as fol-

inch of the edge of a dark ribbon, which should be over an 
inch wide. Allow this to dry. On the upper side of this

glass arrange the grasses, attaching them to it by touches 
of the gum. On the glass, just around its edges, fix a 
narrow strip of cardboard ; on this lay the clear glass, 
pressing the grasses flat. Bring up the unattached edge of 
the ribbon and fix it firmly by the mucilage over the upper 
glass, so imprisoning the grasses in the inclosure. 

One of the most beautiful decorations which may be main- 
tained within the home is found in the aquarium. The theory 
of the aquarium is that it shall so combine animal and vegeta- 
ble life in such exact proportions that the water shall be kept 
entirely pure, never needing change. In other words, the 
vegetable life shall take up the surplus carbon yielded by 
the animal life, and the animal life shall take up the surplus 
oxygen yielded by the vegetable life, and so things will re- 
main in statu quo. The theory is good, but it cannot be 
applied under circumstances sufficiently favorable to guar- 
antee success. 

In the. great aquariums of museums it is found necessary 
to continually force fresh air through the water,' that it may 
be maintained in a sufficiently oxygenized state ; and even 
then, Sliih is the capacity of water for absorbing gases and 
odors from the atmosphere, that it must itself be renewed 
frequently. But the aquarium pays. Aside from the finish 
of the vessel itself, which 
is usually artistic, the plant 
life in water and the ac- 
tivity of the animal life, are 
unceasingly attractive. A 
common glass jar is bet- 
ter than nothing as an aqua- 
rium, though glass globes bux aquarium. 
well adapted for small fish may be had at a low price. 
A better form of aquarium is shown in the accompanying 
cut. Such boxes may be had of all sizes and with great 
variety of finish. 




476 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

But a box is not essential as a beginning for an aquarium. 
The fact is, that any one having a httle ingenuity, and the 
assistance of a handy tinsmith, can fit up a handsome and 
attractive affair. A frame-work may be made of tin to hold 
the glass, and to this frame a zinc bottom should be soldered. 
A bottom of wood underneath all should be finished nicely 
with a deep molding. After the glass has been set and 
well cemented in, the frame may be painted black, or green, 
or gilded, as taste may decide. The tank should be filled 
with fresh water every day until it is thoroughly cleansed, 
before fitting it for occupancy. Then the glass must be 
polished, the bottom covered with clean pebbles, stones, 
and small shells. A rockery, of rich brown and pure white 
stones should be constructed for the centre, surmounted by 
a large shell or two filled with earth, and Lycopodium 
growing therein. Cover this earth with pebbles and press 
'them down firmly about the plant. After all this is ar- 
ranged, put the water in with a dipper, pouring against the 
glass to avoid a disarrangement of the furniture. 

Every morning dip out two or three dippers of water, 
wipe the glass, and fill with fresh water. Use care not to 
disturb the water more than is necessary. There is no 
reason why gold fish will not do well in an aquarium if 
managed in this way. During very warm weather a lump 
of ice occasionally is appreciated by the little golden 
beauties, for they can stand the cold much better than the 
heat. The fact is, that fish, supplied with clear water and a 
cool temperature, have scarcely any other want. The 
omission of all attention to feeding, except in the spring 
months, is as great a kindness as can be shown them. In 
moderate latitudes, from the last of February to the first of 
July, the least crumb of cracker or fish-wafer suffices, and 
during the rest of the year experienced fish-fanciers say very 
little need be given ; that little, may be a few bread-crumbs 
or a pinch of plain cake.

While arranging aquariums attention may be paid to 
parlor rockeries, a less common but no less beautiful home 
decoration. A small parlor rockery can be made most 
satisfactorily by combining the aquarium and rockery, some- 
what as is shown in the accompanying engraving. In a 




PARLOR ROCKERY. 



living-room or .parlor a good deal of sprinkling of the rocks 
must be done, or plants placed in the crevices will dry up. 
This necessitates a basin to catch and retain the drippings. 
It may be of sufficient depth for gold and other fish. It 
can be made of any form desired, and with any ornamenta- 
tion that taste may suggest. 

Or it may be shallow, and be bedded with mosses, ferns, 
and marsh plants, so making a bog-garden. A small faucet 
should be inserted at an inconspicuous point, by which to 
draw off any excess of moisture. Excursions to the 
marshes will furnish an abundance of soil and plants for the 
basin, while a liberal assortment of plants will suit the con- 
ditions of the higher portions. Central to the rockery, a 
pot of roses, lilies, or other plants may be placed, its upper 
rim being concealed by the surrounding rocks. Variety 
and beauty can seldom be secured in one object so freely 
as is a well-kept parlor rockery. 

Ferneries are a well-known parlor decoration. A great 
variety of styles and sizes of bases and vases can be had.

They are made of pottery, of rustic work, of tiled work, of 
iron, and of cabinet ware, and home ingenuity can meet all 
the requirements, even to the inclosing case of glass. The 
fernery shown in the cut we give is in imitation of oak, in 
rustic style, with rustic base. These bases are of different 
sizes, from eight to twelve inches in diameter, the whole 

height, with glass, being from 
twelve to eighteen inches. Al- 
though these are small, still 
they serve a good purpose and 
are easily handled and managed. 
A more elaborate style of 
fernery " may be made with a 
table-like base on four legs and 
casters. The case proper should 
be say sixteen inches in width 
by two and a half feet in length, 
and twenty-six inches high 

above the legs. This can be 
made by any joiner, and can be 

varied to correspond to any style of furniture. The top 

should be made to open for access to the interior, and also 

for ventilation. Within the wooden table-frame is fitted a 

zinc pan about three inches deep, which contains the soil ; 

this pan has an opening for drainage, and a shallow- vessel 

should be placed in a concealed position underneath to 

receive any surplus water. 

Ferneries require a large amount of moisture. The vase, 
or case covering, retains this and the warmth, so making 
perennial spring time for the plants within. All the swamp 
plants are suitable for fernery culture, but ferns do not like 
stagnant water. They flourish in low, moist places — but it 
is where the water is renewed by direct flow, or by subsoil 
drainage, v/hich fact must not be overlooked in the fernery. 

Besides ferns, many kinds of mosses and selaginellas 




RUSTIC FERNERY.

succeed well in 
cases ; also some 
species of grasses, 
caladiums, be- 
gonias of the 
tuberous and the 
rex varieties, the 
sundews or dro- 
seras, some of the 
aroids, ficus rc- 
pens, and others. 
An interesting 
variety of plants 
may, therefore, be 
secured, but ferns 
must be the prin- 
cipal feature. 

The fern-case, 
after it is planted, 
should be placed 
where it can re- 
ceive a good light 
without being too 
much exposed to 
direct sunshine. 
Only sufficient 
water should be 
given to keep the 
soil moist and not 
saturated: Some 
ventilation is re- 
quired, but it need 
be slight, and yet 
it should be care- 
fully attended to

each day, opening the doors of the case just enough to 
clear the glass of moisture. A little experience will enable 
one to care properly for a case. 

Ferneries are frequently adorned with ornaments carved 
in cork. A magnificent work of this kind was lately con- 
structed in London on an order from the King of Siam. 
The entire fernery consisted of five frames, each about ten 
feet in height and width, most artistically constructed, being 
covered with cork colored to resemble a true rockery. 
There is a pool at the base for water lilies and other 
aquatics, with numerous recesses, in which ferns will be 
placed. Several jets of water are arranged so that the 
whole surface will be constantly moist v/ith water dripping 
from the stalactitic projections at the upper part. Spaces at 
the back are filled with mirrors, and as these artificial " rock- 
eries " will occupy an alcove and be disposed in one line, the 
effect will be magnificent, and probably, in its kind, unrivalled. 

A careful observer of nature will soon discover how 
nature fixes herself in her prettiest forms. Observe where 
ferns grow and how they are surrounded. The grasses, the 
mosses, the pebbles — all the accompaniments of fern-growth 
in nature — may be transferred by art into the fernery. But 
art will surpass nature by eliminating all that is unsightly 
and retaining only the beautiful. 

The best cement to prevent leakage in aquariums, fern- 
, eries, etc., is made as follows : Take equal parts of red lead, 
white lead, and litharge; dry, mix thoroughly, pulverizing all 
lumps. Then make into a putty by adding boiled linseed 
oil. Add a little at a time, and only a drop or two when 
nearly done, or you will get it too soft. As soon as the 
cement has been applied, fill the aquarium with water. 

It is possible to make very happy combinations from the 
natural world in internal home decoration. The illustra- 
tions already given have shown this. They combine flowers, 
vines, ferns, mosses, fishes, birds, rustic work, rocks, and other

natural features of beauty. In the cut which follows a style 
of aquarium is shown which contains many points of 
beauty. The aquarium itself shows various forms of animal 
and vegetable life. The trellis allows a fine . opportunity in 
the selection and training of plants, while the bird-cage at

the summit provides additional life, with song added to 
beauty and fragrance. 

Taste, patience, and a little expense are all that are needed 
to produce a beautiful display on this general plan. Taste and 
skill find splendid opportunity in the case of diminutive 
plants and fishes.

Few adornments for the interior of home afford so much 
opportunity for varied, graceful, and really elegant display 
as do hanging-baskets. Drapery is always beautiful, because 
so perfectly natural ; but when flowers are pendant, mingled 
with delicate vines and mosses, then nature is seen in her 
most lovely forms. Such views of nature are furnished in 
hanging-baskets. The materials of which they are composed, 
the forms in which they are wrought, and the flowers 
with which they may be filled, are without limit. Terra- 
cotta ware, wire, and rustic work are chiefly employed, but 
natural objects, such as shells, gourds, 
etc., form the basis of many attractive 
displays of this character. A neat 
hanging-basket is exceeding graceful 
also, and it is in place everywhere, a 
welcome " thing of beauty." 

Plants in vases and hanging-baskets 
are peculiarly situated in respect to 
the moisture in the soil. This is sub- 
ject to rapid evaporation. Not only is 
there the ordinary drainage, such as 
plants in pots have and which is abso- 
lutely necessary, since stagnant water at 
the roots would be fatal, but these plant 
receptacles are usually situated where they are fully exposed 
to the sun and to drying winds. The great demand ol 
basket and vase plants is water, and attention to this supply 
is almost the only care necessary. 

In a room it is almost impossible to moisten plants fully 
and properly. It is best, therefore, that baskets be taken to 
some outer room every day or two for a good soaking, 
where they, may remain until dripping ceases. Where 
a wire basket is used, or an opening is provided for drainage, 
dripping continues for some time. An arrangement is 
shown in the next engraving for catching this drip. It is

merely a second basket or earthen vessel suspended undei 
the main one, and planted so as to 
be both useful and ornamental. 

As the number of plants in bask- 
ets and vases is usually large for 
the quantity of soil they contain, 
it should be rich. What is wanted 
is a rapid, luxuriant growth, with- 
out much regard to the form of in- 
dividual plants. A good soil for 
the purpose may be made of about 
one part of old manure, two parts 
of rotten sods, and one part of sand. 
If leaf-mold can be had, an amount 
of it can be added equal to the sand or manure, if not, the 

mixture without it will 
be quite satisfactor}^ 
When the plants have 
been placed in their 
new quarters and wa- 
tered, it is necessary 
to keep them shaded 
for a short time, and 
if possible they should 
have the advantage ol 
a greenhouse or cold- 
frame until they make 
new roots and com- 
mence to grow freely. 
Concerning plants 
suitable for hanging- 
baskets, James Vick, 
of Rochester, New 
York, an authority on 
the subject, makes the following valuable suggestions :

attached to each ; put the plants outward through the open 
spaces of the basket until it is full. The plants take kindly 
to their unnatural position and soon become a mass of 
beautiful green and brilliant flowers. In each basket place 
an empty tin box, inserted in a cavity in the top portion of 
the earth. Fill this with water daily, and in it place fresh 
flowers, as fancy digt^les. The effect is delightful.

Another is shown in the next cut. It is made of a gourd, 
the top rim being cut into scollops and the bottom end cut 
off to allow drainage. It should be filled with a light, rich 
soil, and if planted with Dichorsandra for its centre and 
Othouna for the droop, its effect will be most beautiful. 

Hanging vases of silvered 
double glass can be had. A 
false bottom is added to pro- 
mote drainage, and by means 
of a tube the gathered water 
can be drawn off. The effect 
of foliage is greatly improved 
by the reflecting surfaces of 
such a vase. 

Birds arc charming pets in a 
home. Their sweet songs add 
exquisite pleasure to other 
natural beauties. A talking 
parrot is hardly to be reckoned 
as a gem ; but a singing canary 
is a prize. The trouble of keep- 
ing them is sometimes complained of, but bird-fanciers 
sum up the whole matter thus : 

Keep the cage clean. 

Place the cage so that no draft of air can strike the bird, 
and not too. near windows in cold weather. 

Give nothing to healthy birds but seed, water, cuttle-fish 
bone, and gravel on the floor of cage. An occasional lump 
of pure white sugar may be added. 

Occasionally a little water for bathing. 

The room should not be overheated. 

When moulting (shedding feathers) keep warm and avoid 
drafts of air. 

Give plenty of rape seed. 

A little hard-boiled ^%% grated fine is excellent.

LADIES' HANDIWORK. 

Beyond all the professional decorator can do, and all that 
can be done with natural objects, there is a realm of decora- 
tive possibility where the wives and daughters of our homes 
reign supreme. Their skillful fingers and exquisite taste 
work wonders of ornamentation. The internal fittinsfs and 
furnishings of a house are but the framework on v/hich 
those who love and brighten home display their choice 
embellishments. 

To specify all the beautiful things which tasty ladies 
can make with unpromising material is not possible ; much 
less can these attractions be described. But the subject 
may be illustrated, and hints concerning it may be given. 

Mantel decorations are very popular and elegant. They 
are attached to a board placed on the mantel slab. This is 
covered with the chosen material, which also depends from 
the edge — plain, plaited, scalloped, or draped. An elegant 
decoration of this kind, recently exhibited in the Decorative 
Art Rooms, of New York, was made of deep, wine-colored 
plush cut in a shallow scallop, the centre being about 
eighteen inches deep, and caught up carelessly with a hand- 
some cord and pompon tassels one-quarter yard from each 
end, so that a very graceful, draped effect was given. Its 
centre was decorated with a branch design of wild roses, so 
arranged that its uppermost part will lay over on the man- 
tel. The blossoms — made of rose-colored velvet — were so 
folded as to be a perfect representation of real rose petals ; 
stamens and pistils were worked with gold thread ; leaves 
and branches in arrasene. The bottom was finished with 
alternate tassels of pink and light and dark shades of olive. 

Another design was made of olive macrame twine cro- 
cheted in an open pattern and having two-inch wide cardinal 
satin ribbon interlaced in the openings. This twine comes 
in a variety of colors, and to make a lambrequin eighteen 
inches deep and fringe would require five bunches.

There are imported tapestry designs for valances and 
chair-backs which are sought after by those who wish to 
furnish in antique style. They come in quaint designs, 
usually rural scenes, worked in quarter single stitches, 
which resemble a woven 
texture in their fine- 
ness, and are to be filled 
in with whatever solid 
color may seem adapt- 
ed. Illustrations of this 
art will be found among 
the various cuts of this 
volume. 

An ordinary kitchen 
table can be transformed 
into quite an elegant 
piece of furniture for 
the library. The top 
and legs are smoothly 
covered with green 
cloth ; the seam neatly 
sewed, and on the in- 
side, that it may not 
show. It is then tacked 
at the top to hold it in 
place. Cloth is then 
drawn smoothly over 
the top and tacked all round the sides. The piece extending 
round the sides of the table must also be covered. An under 
shelf made of pine wood covered with cloth is then fitted 
securely to the legs about eight inches below the top. A 
heavy cord fringe of green worsted must be fastened round 
the edge of the top, also round the shelf, with brass-headed 
nails about an inch and a half apart. A caster fitted into 
each leg will finish this very handsome table. 




MINIATURE TABLE FOR FRUIT. 



492 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



' A miniature table, to be used as an ornamental fruit-stand, 
is shown in the preceding cut. It is made of bamboo, rustic 
branches, or turned legs, painted or gilded, as taste suggests. 
These are attached at their tops to a wide hoop, into which 
a deep dish fits firmly. The legs are then tied securely at 
their point of crossing with a cord and tassel. The outer 
edge of the hoop is then ornamented with drapery of bright 
colored cloth or satin with bead work, ornamented with 
tassels. A painted plaque or handsome dish may be 
inserted in the table, and so serve as a card-receiver. 

A handsome 
table-cover 
may be made 
of sateen with 
a plush bor- 
dering. The 
centre should 
be of olive 
green, the 
border of a 
darker shade. 
On the four

" Great variety may be secured in standing work-baskets. 
Stands of great variety in wicker-work are sold. Get one 
with two shelves, in each of which cut a hole large enough 
to receive an ordinary straw hat, crown downward. The 
braid around the edges of the shelves must be gilt, also the 
rings. The brim of the upper hat must have a full facing 
of blue satin. A bag of the same is fitted into tlie crown 
and drawn together with a satin ribbon at its top. A bunch 
of artificial roses and leaves is fastened on one side of the 
brim. The under hat has a full facing of satin, cut large 
enough to serve as a lining for the crown. A large, gilt 
ring is fastened to the edge of the upper shelf between each 
pair of supports, and a broad band of satin ribbon, which 
may be hand-painted, is run through each ring, then crossed 
to the lower shelf, where it is fastened to the leg with a 
double bow and ends. The outside of the hats may be gilded 
if preferred. 

The adjoining cut 
shows another form of 
stand. This stand may 
be bought in rattan, or 
made of rustic boughs 
suitably curved. Two 
hoops are used in this 
stand, into which paint- 
ed or ornamental dishes 
fit securely, their edges 
being hung with crewel 
or with bead-work. To 
make the bead border- 
ing, take a narrow strip 
of oil-cloth and fit it 
tightly around the edges 
of the hoops and plates. visiting-card stand. 

Measure off equal distances and sew on black jet buttons. 




494 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 



From these, string bronze beads for the first or upper row. 
Make the second row of gold beads and the third of white. 
Attach these to the jet buttons. Make a final row of 
variously colored beads, twisted together, and fastened to 

the jet buttons. After these 
are all in place and grace- 
fully festooned, cut away 
any of the oil-cloth which 
shows below the ornaments. 
Fancy baskets are capable 
of very beautiful adornment. 
Such baskets can be had 
in the stores in many de- 
cidedly attractive forms. 
The work upon those 
shown in the illustrations 
is such as a practiced eye 
can readily trace. The 
blending of colors will af- 
ford fine opportunity for a 
display of taste. Even the 
scrap-basket may be so em- 
bellished that the container 
of refuse becomes a minis- 
ter of pleasure. The willow-ware furnished for this purpose 
is varied so greatly and so elegantly that a good base for 
operations is easily secured. The decorations can be 
attached readily also, which is a point of value. The result 
is so light in weight, and withal so beautiful and useful, that 
scrap-basket decoration becomes specially inviting. 

A novelty in scrap-baskets may be made as follows : 
Select a medium-sized Japanese umbrella with a plain 
ground and gilt figures. Glue the knob or point securely 
into a square or circular block of wood smoothly finished. 
This block must be heavy enough to serve as a stand for

the umbrella and hold it steadily in its upright position. 

The block is to be painted the color of the umbrella and 

decorated with gilt 

figures. To prevent 

the umbrella from fall- 
ing open, the points of 

the ribs must be inter- 
laced with satin ribbon. 

Several shades of the 

narrowest ribbons 

may be turned in and 

out of the ribs like 

basket-work, or a wide 

ribbon may be used. 

The umbrella should be 

not quite half open. A 

piece of gilt paper must 

be cut to fit the inside 

of the umbrella and 

prevent papers and scraps from falling through to the point, 

from whence it 
would be difficult 
to remove them. 
If narrow ribbons 
are used for the 
lacings, tie a 
bunch of them 
round the handle 
with long loops 
and ends, and 
their many colors 
make a gay trim- 
ming. With the

A Japanese umbrella may be utilized as a fire-screen by 

adorning it with peacock's feathers. Cut off the stems of 

the feathers to within a few inches of the eyes ; then stitch 

the eyes on in rows around 
the umbrella, beginning at 
the outer edge, and have 
each row to overlap the 
other till the centre is 
reached ; then finish the 
centre off with a tuft of 
small feathers. The um- 
brella should never be 
closed, as the shutting 
would be disastrous to the 
feathers. When completed, 
the handle of the umbrella 
may be set into an upright 
shaft, which is supported 

in a base of heavy wood. The umbrella-handle should not 

exceed six inches in length, 

the support about two feet 

high. The base and support 

should be brightly colored. 
A beautifully embroidered 

fire-screen is shown in the 

adjoining cut. Frames for 

these can be purchased in 

many styles ; the taste and 

skill of home fill out the 

centre. The materials for 

this centre are varied and 

elegant, and if well handled, 

the result must be delightful. 

The screens are valuable to 

shade the glow of a fire or to screen from observation.

kinds of work, are brought 
to bear on pincushions, and 
many are the conquests 
which have been made in 
this line. Every home has 
something in the way of 
bureau-covers, toilet sets, 
tidies, sofa-cushions, pillow- 
shams, pen-wipers, shaving 
cases, whisp-holders, etc., 
etc. In many instances these are but rude attempts, and 
yet they are not to be despised. Rude attempts always 
precede success, and sometimes inaugurate it. Welcome, 
then, every honest attempt at art.

answered also as a coal and wood box. It was a box with 
a hinged top, which was wadded to form a cushion, the

made of two circular pieces of wood nailed at the ends of a 

short, stout pole. 
On the bottom 
four casters were 
fixed. It was then

with lace about an eighth of an inch wide and caught in the 
Centre with a piece of blue ribbon tied in a full bow, 
which also held it fast to the nail. The ends hung from 
each side of the nail down to the front corners of the table,

back to the wall. Upon the table was a pretty toilet set in 
light blue glass, a set of toilet mats worked upon pale blue

with blue bows. 

A few special features of upholstery, which any lady of

In doing any of this upholstered and cushioned work, the 
best way is to make and fit all the parts with cushions made 
of ticking or other substantial material. When the fit is 
assured, cover with cretonne, leather, or other goods, and 
finish as desired. On the top an ornamental tuft or suitable

CANOPIED AND CURTAINED BEDSTEAD.— STYLE OF LOUIS XIV. 

Embroidery and painting are very popular and elegant 
employments for ladies. Both these arts may rise very 
high. The famous Bayeux tapestry contains 1,512 figures, 
of which sixty-five are dogs, 202 horses, 505 other quadru- 
peds, birds, or sphinxes ; 623 are men, twenty-seven build- 
ings, forty-one boats, and forty-nine trees. It is divided 
into fifty-eight parts, each representing a scene in the career 
of William the Conqueror, and each having an inscription 
in Latin. This tapestry is of linen, two hundred feet long

by twenty inches wide. Worsteds in seven colors are used 
in it. It is preserved in the town hall of Bayeux, France, 
and is regarded as the work of Queen Matilda, in the twelfth 
century. 

From this pinnacle of art there are gradations, almost 
imperceptible, downward to the simplest work of school- 
girls and little children. Knitting and crochet work also 
are varied beyond. the power of adequate 
description, and so are many other forms 
of useful and ornamental needlework. 

Decorative painting has a scope equally 
broad. In home work it employs all 
grades and hues of coloring material and 
exercises itself upon woods, china, glass, 
shells, silks, satins, velvets, and almost 
every other attainable fabric. A thou- 
sand or more dollars is not a sum un- 
usual for a hand-painted porcelain vase 

of no great size. Fifty dollars is a 
common price for a single high- 
grade hand-painted plate, and as 
much for an ornamental wall 
plaque. But these are the extra- 
vagances of decoration. A few 
such articles tone up the taste of a 
community, but they cannot be 
generally indulged in. Some gems 
of art are, however, within the 
reach of all. One who has not 
looked into the facts of this sub- 
ject will be amazed at the variety 
and elegance of small wares which 
are strictly artistic. In wood, 
china, metal, pottery, and woven fabrics they are found in 
charming forms, and at low prices.

them dug up at ancient Troy by Dr. Schliemann— have been 
reproduced with exact conforrhity in shape and size. High 
reUef is a characteristic of this ware. Flowers, leaves, stems, 
and other forms stand boldly out and 
afford a most inviting field for the artistic 
hand. The accompanying illustrations 
show the general appearance of these 
goods, which vary in sizes from eight to 
eighteen inches in diameter, or in height. 
On this matter of painting and orna- 
mentation a word of warning may be 
raised. Things are ornamented which 
are better plain. Every article of mer- 
chandise has its ornament stamped or 
attached in some way. Clothing, bed- 
linen, table-linen, tinware, woodenware, silverware — all 
sorts of ware — are covered with monograms, coats-of-arms, 
meaningless emblems, and intri- 
cate convolutions, the fundamen- 
tal idea of which neither owner 
nor maker can tell. Better leave 
some articles for unadorned 
utility. 

And some proper subjects for 
decoration are improperly deco- 
rated. Imagine the " Author 
Dinner Plates !" — An excellent 
portrait of the honored Long- 
fellow is smothered in gravy ; 
potatoes are piled upon the beard 
of Bryant, while fish-bones

even though they be elegantly painted. A china set of

good taste, but the little girl of the household shrinks with 
horror from a certain garden-worm whenever her food hap- 
pens to accompany that decoration. 
The law is this : Decorate none but 
proper articles, and decorate them 
properly. 

Clarence Cook, writing on over- 
decoration, delivers himself in the 
following forceful words : " The 
architects cannot design a house or 
a church, but they must carve every 
stone ; cover the walls with cold, 
discordant tiles ; break up every i

in not seeing the whole of everything

III.— EXTERIOR DECORATIONS. 

ARTISTIC architecture is doing wonders in the ex- 
ternal decoration of homes. Even where long rows 
of city houses stand in serried ranks, the present ten- 
dency is to break up monotony, to secure beautiful variety. 
This is done by introducing diversity of forms and colors. 
Bay-windows, mansard-roofs, Swiss projections, permanent 
window-gardens, variously colored bricks, slates, tiles, 
stones, etc., and the splendid decorations in terra cotta, 
make fine variety possible. Where stone is used ornamen- 
tation is limited only by the genius of the architect and the 
purse of the owner. 

In cathedrals and grand public buildings, statuary plays 
an important part in decoration, but for private use this is 
unsuitable, except the house be very large and ornate. In 
private grounds, statuary and vases are allowable if in har- 
mony with their surroundings. Mercury should not be the 
conspicuous piece in a camp-meeting ground, nor should St. 
Peter or St. Paul be the chief feature in a commercial ex- 
change. 

The choice materials for statuary are marble and bronze. 
For outside positions, the stress of weather is damaging, 
however, and the general effect is none the less happy if 
baser materials be employed. Such ornaments are a spe- 
cialty with the J. W. Fiske Company, of New York, where 
reproductions of the best works of statuary and vases are 
prepared in iron and zinc, and of all desirable sizes. A few 
ornaments of this character will greatly improve any 
grounds. Their location should be artistic, and with an 
eye for the effect. It is not the vase alone that should be 
displayed, but its display should beautify the surroundings.

In rural homes, or those where 
architecture of the house is of 
no great consequence, for trees 
and vines can be so disposed 
as to make it seem magnifi-

house has greater possibilities. 
The lawn is a most attractive 
feature, if nicely graded, well 
grassed, and closely cropped 
by a lawn-mower. Trees and 
smaller shrubbery must be 
placed with reference to their 
effect. In the great parks

Egyptian vases for garden uses are beautiful, but the 
strong coloring of the ancients must be shunned, especially 
in the upper part, where they mingle with the flowers. In 
the accompanying cut of an Egyptian vase the base (b) is 
constructed of wood, and is painted 
bright blue, red, and yellow, or merely 
tinted a light or porcelain blue and red 
toned to a brownish cast. The flower- 
pot, or upper part (a), is to be made 
of red clay or terra cotta, the orna- ^j 
ments in relief to be colored a green- 
ish blue, eau de Nile. The pot with 
its contents should be removed to the 
greenhouse when the cold weather 
comes on, the pedestal remaining as a 
permanent winter decoration. 

Home-made vases may be con- 
structed of cast-off boxes of small 
size, half-kegs, etc. These are readily ^^^ 
covered with rustic strips, made of bark 
or of pieces of sapling cut in half 
longitudinally. Holes must be bored 
in the bottoms, and the whole be 
mounted on an upright post two or three feet in height. 

^ With standing plants in the 
centre, and trailing plants at 
the edges, very beautiful dis-

FORM OF PRUNING A HEDGE. 



It has become customary in the most beautiful rural cities 
and villages to discard fences. A stone curbing marks the 
street line, while the dividing line of neighbors is not visi- 
ble, but the open lawn, kept by mutual arrangement, runs 
ij / I on unbroken. Hedges 

may be employed as 
necessary fencing, or to 
conceal unsightly ob- 
jects which cannot be 
removed. A good hedge 
requires a good soil, so 
that its growth may be 
vigorous. The plants, 
when set out, should be of equal size and set in a single line. 
The Japan quince can be planted six inches apart, and the 
honey locust and Osage orange at nine inches. 

Different styles of planting have been practiced, such as 
setting the plants in double or triple rows, setting them 
very closely, as within three or four inches of each other, 
and also at distances as great as eighteen inches or two feet. 
Experience has shown 
that the plants when 
close to each other 
grow thin and feebly ; 
that with sufficient care 
a better hedge can be 
made with wide than 
with narrow planting. 
In the spring of the 
second year the soil about the hedge must be well worked. 
The main shoot must be cut back to within one joint of its 
;starting point, the side shoots remaining a little longer. 
In the third spring, trim in a pyramidal form, as in the 
iirst cut. This secures light and air at the centre of the 
plant. A later cutting may bring the branches back almost

to the first outline. Four or five years will secure a hedge 

five feet high and six feet thick, through which neither man 

nor beast can pass. It^ form may be trimmed at last into 

that shown in the second cut. 

Rustic seats always adorn grounds of reasonable extent. 

Single chairs or extended benches may 

be made, and stumps or other unsightly 

objects may be pressed into the service of 

beauty and utility. Over rustic seats 

vines should clamber, or trees should cast 

their shade. No one wishes to sit in the 

glare of the sun. A Virginia creeper 

will speedily form a dense covering for 

such a place. A little care will train 

it as an arch, an umbrella, an awning, a 

tent, or almost any desired object. 

For outdoor flower-holders many de- rustic chair. 

vices have been worked out. There are terra-cotta pots 

fashioned to resemble stumps and rustic boxes. Rightly 

placed, these heighten the ar- 
tistic effect of a garden. For 
all plants in vases, or similar 
vessels, special attention is 
needed or they will dry out. 
If sufficient water is given 
there is no danger from the 
heat of the sun — perhaps it is 
an advantage. Instead of 
watering with a pitcher, give 
^ a pailful at a time, gently and 
slowly showered upon the 
plants. After the trailing 

plants in a vase fall over the sides, they afford a shade ; but 

if anything like proper care is used, plants will thrive as 

well in vases as in any other location.

The Gypsy Kettle is a pretty decoration for a garden. 
The error of making it gaudy should be avoided. Its col- 
ors should not rival those of its contents. When a crown-

used on the stand, 
allow it the trailing 
plants, while the 
erect occupy the 
larger receptacle.

Birds may add to the charms of a garden. Aviaries, 
which can be removed to a warm apartment in winter, may 
decorate the grounds in summer. They should be elevated, 
to keep out enemies of the birds, unless the inclosing 
meshes be so fine as to render this precaution useless. 




PORTABLE AVIARY. 

On ground which is quite moist, but not submerged, a 
number of interesting plants may be raised. When the 
depth of water is eighteen inches and over, and the supply 
so that there will be no failure in a dry time, water lilies 
may be raised, and pontederias, or pickerel weed, heteran- 
thera, eel grass, white water crowfoot, water target, and the 
handsome foreigner, the Cape pond-weed.

For the margin, in shallowwater, there is a numerous 
class of plants, such as the different species of rush, the cat- 
tail hair, the water plantain, the loosestrife, or lythrum, 
nesaea, Dutch moss, or anacharis, and the handsome water 
pitchers. 

Here, too, we may have the mosses, which Ruskin thus 
describes : " Meek creatures ! the first mercy of the earth, 
veiling with hushed softness its dintless rock ; creatures full 
of pity, covering with strange and tender honor the scarred

stones to teach them rest. No words that I know will say 
what these mosses are. None are delicate enough, none 
perfect enough, none rich enough. They will not be 
gathered, like the flowers, for chaplet or love token ; but of 
these the wild bird will make its nest, and the wearied child 
his pillow. And as they are the earth's first mercy, so they 
are its last gifts to us ; when all other service is vain from

plant and tree, the soft mosses and gray lichen take up their 
watch by the head-stone. The woods, the blossoms, the 
gift-bearing grasses have done their parts for a time, but 
these do service forever." 

One of the prettiest freaks of nature is that which buries 
a house in vines. For the most satisfactory results the vines 
must be favorably rooted in the earth. Balcony gardening 
and exterior window gardening may go on beautifully by 
means of pots and boxes, but such work is, necessarily, of 
limited extent. One of the most striking instances of vine 
decoration is shown in the engraving here given. It is an 
actual drawing from 
a French home. A 
vine-loving visitor 
thus described it in 
one of our floral 
monthlies : " From 
the flag sidewalk 
grew a large grape- 
vine, with a stem pos- 
sibly five inches in 
thickness, without a 
branch or leaf until it 
reached the second 
story. It was then 
trained over the bal- 
cony, making a most 
beautiful arbor, and 
ascended still higher. 
Being the latter part 
of the summer, the 
vine was well loaded 
with white g-rapes.

somewhat after the manner in which English gardeners 
sometimes grow cucumbers. I have never seen another 
balcony that seemed to me so charming." 

The Canary Flower is a beautiful 
r vine, but little used, and yet well 
adapted to our climate. Its leaves are 
a beautiful, light green, and its flow- 
ers of a bright lemon yellow color. 
The flowers grow in rich masses and 
make a splendid appearance when in 
luxuriant growth. The appended cut

the top Hke an Indian tent, while with these Morning Glo- 
ries may be blended, so producing a rapid shade, which is 
very beautiful to behold. Shady places are more favorable 
to Nasturtiums than those more exposed, but loosening the 
soil and watering freely will work wonders for them even 
in the dryest times. 










CALADTUM PLANTS. 

And now, while on the shady places. It may as well be 
said that it is by no means easy to obtain flowers without 
some sunshine. Two hours of sunshine a day will, how- 
ever, give life enough to many plants to insure flowers. In 
shady places we can have ferns, of course, and Caladiums, 
Cannas, and other foliage plants, but it is not best to trV 
flowers. 

Where there are two hours of sunshine we can have Fuch- 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 523 

ias, Pansies, Lily of the Valley, Perennial Phloxes, For- 
get-me-nots, and many other things that succeed better in 
partial shade than in the full sunshine. For such places 
the Japan and California Lilies are pre-eminently valuable. 

The Caladium has become a great favorite in this country, 
as it well deserves to be, because its leaves are so large and 
handsome, and also because it never disappoints. It is very 
rare for a bulb to fail to grow and give satisfaction. The 
preceding engraving is from a photograph of a plant of one 
season only. Leaves of the Caladium have grown to be by 
actual measurement three feet and seven inches in leneth. 
thirty inches in width, and ten feet three inches in circum- 
ference. Another leaf has been reported which reached the 
enormous length of forty-one inches, and was twenty-eight 
inches wide. While so gigantic, they are also beautiful in 
texture, and strikingly so from their splendid size. 

Other splendid leaf plants are numerous and inexpensive. 
The Ricinus, or castor-oil plant, is a king in its way. Rich 
and luxuriant in appearance and quick to grow, it is justly 
a great favorite. The Maranta, or Calathea, is a splendidly 
stdped leaf plant. The leaves grow from one to two feet in 
length, are purple underneath, and beautifully ribbed with 
velvet on top. This is also a splendid in-door plant. 

Everybody knows the value of roses and other flowering 
plants. The superb catalogues of the leading florists of the 
country furnish all needed information concerning them, so 
that the only duty here is to point out these ample sources 
of information and supply, and commend the public to try 
the best of them. 

A glimpse at French gardening is given in the following 
view of the garden of Fontainebleau, the pride of the Parisian 
heart. The very trees are trimmed into perfect order. In- 
deed, this garden is excessive in its regularity. There are 
too many right lines. Landscape gardening, with its unend- 
ing variety, commands more general favor in this country.

The same objection lies against the style shown in the 
following cut, which is a view from the grounds of an 
Italian nobleman. 

Clearly, in this case, the master mind was of a strictly 
mathematical turn. There are flov/er-beds, plenty of them, 
laid out on the square ; plenty of shrubbery, every alternate 
piece being clipped to a uniform cylinder. There is a liberal 
display of statuary, all standing just so high and at a uniform

distance apart, the whole ground evidently having been laid 
out with compass and square to a mathematical point. 

A few gardens of this character are pleasing ; or a portion 
of any garden so laid out secures variety, but such regular- 
ity -must be occasional only. The distinctly marked figures 
in the heavens are very few, and we of the earth may take a 
lesson therefrom. But some right lines and sharply marked 
figures are admissible. 

The ribbon beds, now so popular for parks, lawns, and 
gardens, are beautiful illustrations of regularity. This system 



526 



THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 




of bedding, it is claimed, is artificial, and not in good taste, 
which possibly is true ; but tastes differ and change con- 
stantly. It is now thought in good taste to imitate and 

admire the productions of 
Japanese art by those who, 
a few years ago, ridiculed 
poor, benighted Japs. So 
taste changes in flower beds. 
Ribbon beds may be of flowering or 
variegated leaf-plants, or of both in com- 
bination. The principal consideration in mak- 
ing such beds is to procure plants of nearly 
uniform height, and flowering, that will keep in 
bloom during the whole season, for a failure in 
either respect will mar, if not ruin, the bed. The 
plants must be set so close together, that when they 
have attained their growth, the whole bed will be 
RIBBON covered without a break. The tops must be pinched 
off judiciously so that there will be no excessive 
growth, but that they all will show evenly. 

One of the finest displays of variegated flower beds can 

be made with the bul- 
bous plants of the early 
spring. Crocuses, Hy- 
acinths, and Tulips 
may all adorn the gar- 
dens, and if carefully 
selected and arranged 
splendid effects will be 
secured as the reward of the gardener's taste and skill. • 

There is really no limit to the styles which may be intro- 
duced in these beds, both in their component parts and in 
their forms. From the diminutive growth of the lowest- 
growing plants to the most stately of them, all find a place 
and a use in ribbon beds.

Dwarf trees are a specialty with the Chinese. Pines and 
oaks a half century old are seen in their flower-pots. The 
secret of the dwarfing is in weakening the seat of vigor all 
that is possible without destroying life. Take, for example, 
a young cedar two or three inches high and cut off its tap 
root, resetting that on a stone in a shallow pan with a clay

soil. Water and light enough to keep the plant alive are 
allowed, but no more. The shape is controlled by pegs and 
strings, and is often very odd. The Japanese carry this 
dwarfing to such a ridiculous degree that a Dutch merchant 
was shown a box three inches deep and with a square inch 
of surface, in which a bamboo, a fir, and a plum tree— the 
latter in full bloom— were growing and thriving. The price 
asked for this botanical curiosity was three hundred dollars.

Tastefully made rockeries are good adornments. They 
need not be built into arches and beacons, as is done some- 
times with questionable taste, but they should be sufficiently 
large to deserve their title. The rocks must be so sepa- 
rated as to allow deep pockets of rich earth to be con- 
structed. Many charm- 
ing native plants will 
flourish in such places, 
but will not succeed in 
more open and ex- 
posed beds. The trail- 
ing arbutus, the par- 
tridge-berry, the dog's-

root, Gentians, and Pyrolas, may be placed on a rock-work 
such as this. For early blossoms, crocus, snowdrops, the

How sweet and e^racious, even in common speech, 
Is that fine sense which men call courtesy !

Polite Deportment. 



SOME one has said that " a man's manners are his for- 
tune," meaning that the way to position and easy 
competence in Hfe is often found through gentleness and 
good breeding, which lead first to genuine respect, then to 
esteem and confidence. Many a young man has failed to 
secure a coveted place by reason of his boorish ways or 
awkward movements at a first interview, and foolishly charged 
his loss to " ill luck," when the fault was wholly with him- 
self Many another has moved right up to a well-deserved 
eminence in his calling more by his genteel and polite bear- 
ing than by reason of some superior mental capacity. 

WHERE TO LOOK FOR MODELS. 

True gentlemen and ladies may be found in the humblest 
walks of life, among both young and old. The marks that 
prove them such are not wholly external, though the inter- 
nal conditions are evidenced by the external. There is a 
sham politeness which bows and smirks and is obeisant in 
public, but is detestably wanting in common civility in pri- 
vate. Such as indulge in this kind wear their manners as 
one wears an outer garment, which is put on when leaving 
home and left on the hall rack at the door when returning 
home. Some of these are the over-nice people, who pre- 
tend to hide their faces and try to affect blushes at the mere 
mention of some very natural and proper subjects. Others 
are known as the Exquisite, the Dandy, the Fop, the Dude, 
whose brains are generally less than their surface manners. 

531 



532 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

It is evident tliat as the principles of a language are 
derived from the usage of the best writers and speakers, so 
the principles of polite deportment are derived from the 
usage of the truest and best people. The rules in the one 
case are not more definite than in those of the other. The 
highest point of culture to which any one may attain in 
either is purely a matter of choice. The beginning must be 
in one's-self, but with an assurance that the largest success 
is not only practicable, but a duty to self and to society. 

THE REAL GENTLEMAN AND LADY. 

A recent writer thus well describes the true gentleman 
and lady : " To formulate the definition in negatives would 
be easy. As, for instance, we may say that a true gentle- 
man does not soil his conscience with falsehood, does not 
waste his time upon sensual indulgence, does not endeavor 
to make the worse appear the better reason, does not ridi- 
cule sacred subjects, does not willfully give cause of offense 
to any, does not seek to overreach his neighbor, does not 
forget the respect due to womanhood or to old age, the feeble 
or the poor. And so, too, the true lady does not conde- 
scend to scandal or gossip, does not profane her lips with 
* slang ' words, does not yield to outbursts of temper, does 
not sacrifice modesty to fashion, does not turn a deaf ear to 
the voice of distress. But, to speak affirmatively : A gentle- 
man is one whose aims are generous, whose trust is 
constant, whose word is never broken, whose honor is never 
stained, who is as brave as gentle and as honest as wise, 
who wrongs no one by word or deed, and devotes and em- 
bellishes life by nobility of thought, depth of feeling, and 
grace of manner. As for the true lady — she will be, of 
necessity, the counterpart of the true gentleman : Pure, 
refined, generous, sweet of temper, gentle of speech, truthful 
to her heart's core, shunning the very appearance of evil, 
and instant in well-doing." 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 533 

PERSONAL HABITS. 

We are now ready to consider personal habits in their 
relation to polite deportment. Every person owes certain 
well-defined obligations to society, not only in the line of 
what is said and done in the presence of others, but in the 
appearance and habits, which in an important degree affect 
the comfort and pleasure of others. It has been well said 
that " cleanliness, neatness, and tidiness represent the triple 
incentive to the maintenance of any and every system of 
etiquette." An untidy person of either sex gives evidence 
either of ignorance or willful disregard of the commonest 
principles of politeness. 

Other things being equal, the person who enjoys good 
health will be the best-mannered, and no one has any right 
to live in disregard of those practices and conditions which 
produce or promote health. The daily bath, proper cleans- 
ing of the teeth and mouth, scrupulous care as to the 
finger-nails, and careful dressing of the hair^without oils, 
pomades, or perfumes — are essential duties. Over-eating, 
with its train of headaches, foul breath, and indigestion ; 
and the use of tobacco in any form, with disgusting expecto- 
ration, are not the practices which mark the best-bred per- 
sons. " If one must chew, let him be particular where he 
expectorates. He should not discharge tobacco-juice in 
public vehicles, on the sidewalk, nor in any place where it 
will be offensive. The English rule is for him to spit in his 
handkerchief; but this is not a pleasant alternative. On 
some occasions no other may offer." Whether smoking is 
good or bad, 'wholesome or injurious, the excess of 
smoking is, at all events, as noxious to the smoker as it is 
disagreeable to his neighbors. If you must have your pipe 
or your weed, retire to some apartment kept exclusively as 
a smoking-room. Do not smoke in a lady's presence ; not 
even if her good nature prompt her to yield assent. You 



534 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

have no right to impregnate her garments with pot-house 
odor. 

Toilet offices of all kinds should be in private. Cleansing 
the nose or the ears, or cleaning and trimming the finger 
nails in public, is an offense against decency, and never 
should be indulged in. Biting the nails, fingering the 
beard, drumming on the table with your fingers, crossing 
your legs and shaking your fi-ee foot, loud breathing, yawn- 
ing, snuffling, and going about with hands thrust in the 
pockets, are not marks of politeness and good breeding. A 
quiet and self-possessed manner and quiet movements of 
the person are always better than restless and disturbing 
habits, which are sure to be obtrusive as well as dis- 
agreeable. 

HABITS OF SPEECH. 

One's habits of speech will betray the inward character. 
Truly polite people do not use other than polite language, 
which is but a plain, simple, and unaffected expression of 
one's thoughts. Coarse and vulgar words, slang phrases, 
and profanity should never have place. Some people swear 
because of an idea that it is manly; some from habit, with- 
out thinking of what they say ; some are only profane when 
excited with anger ; some from choice, neither fearing God 
nor regarding man, and in defiance of the divine command, 
" Swear not at all." A lady was once annoyed by the fre- 
quent oaths of a young student sitting near her in a rail- 
road car. She kindly addressed h-im with a question 
whether he had studied the languages. " I have mastered 
them thoroughly," he replied. "Do you speak Hebrew?" 
she asked. '' I do," was the answer. " Then will you do 
me the favor to do your swearing in Hebrew P'-^ she asked. 
The rebuke was effectual.. 

With regard to the use of slang words by a lady, we are 
reminded of the grisly fairy story of a beautiful young 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 535 

woman from whose mouth, when she opened it, dropped 
frogs and toads. The practice of slang is as unworthy of a 
gentleman as it is of a lady. 

• Civility in speech is due to every person, and on all occa- 
sions. Employers would do well to remember that civil 
words, with kind and thoughtful actions, make friends of 
workmen or servants. Their use tends to bind more closely 
those who are already friends. Arrogance of speech and 
manner toward inferiors is on a par with servility toward 
superiors. True dignity and self-respect will lead to a cor- 
rect deportment in dealing with either. There is a possi- 
bility of being over-civil. Promptly pick up anything that 
a lady lets fall, but do not rush to wait upon even a n"iend, 
lest you become servile in your attentions to the embarrass- 
ment of both yourself and your friend. You will not, how- 
ever, fail in proper attention to elderly people. A nice 
sense of respect for the aged and kind attentions to them 
show a good heart. 

General fussiness ought to be carefully avoided. Whether 
well or sick, it is needless, and entails a great deal of trou- 
ble and annoyance upon our friends. " There is nothing 
more fatal to comfort, as well as to decorum of behavior, 

than fuss." 

AFFECTATION. 

Affectation of any kind is ridiculous in any one. It may 
be termed " posing for effect." An article in Harper's 
Bazar Book paints some specimens : " The delicate young 
lady with the languid air, the listless step, or die-away pos- 
ture ! The literary young lady with the studiously ne- 
glected toilette, the carefully exposed breadth of forehead, 
and the ever-present but seldom-read book ! The abste- 
mious young lady, who surreptitiously feeds on chops at 
private lunch and starves on a pea at the public dinner ! 
The humane young lady, who pulls Tom's ears and other- 
wise tortures brother and sister in the nursery and does her 
34 



536 ^-^^^ ^^<^ ^^^ WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

utmost to fall into convulsions before company at the sight 
of a dead fly ! and the fastidious young lady, who faints — 
should there be an audience to behold the scene — at the 
sight of roast goose, but whose robust appetite vindicates 
itself by devouring all that is left of the unclean animal when 
a private opportunity will allow. Such affectations are not 
only absurd — for they are perfectly transparent — but ill-bred, 
as shams of all kinds essentially are." 

Sidney Smith says: "All affectation proceeds from the 
supposition of possessing something better than the rest of 
the world possesses. Nobody is vain of possessing two 
legs and two arms, because that is the precise quantity of 
either sort of limb which everybody possesses." The 
affected individual is always full of self-consciousness, and 
this is simple vulgarity. A truly polite person is too busy 
in considering the comfort and welfare of others to devote 
much time to thoughts of a purely selfish character. 

DRESS. 

Closely related to personal habits is the question of dress. 
It has been well said that " the result of the finest toilet 
should be an elegant woman, not an elegantly dressed 
woman." Chesterfield's advice to his son was sensible, and 
applies well to our own times : *' Dress yourself fine where 
others are fine, and plain where others are plain ; but take 
care always that your clothes are well made and fit you, for 
otherwise they will give you a very awkward air. When 
you are once well dressed for the day, think no more of it 
afterward, and without any stiffness for fear of discomposing 
that dress, let all your motions be easy and natural, as if 
you had no clothes on at all." 

The objects of dress may be considered as threefold: To 
secure personal comfort and health, to preserve modesty, 
and to please the taste. Of men's clothing there is not 
much to say, except that it should be of quiet colors and 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 537 

well fitting. There is little opportunity for either contrasts 
or harmonious combinations of colors. But with the dress 
of women it is different. The most costly materials will fail 
to produce an agreeable impression unless their colors are 
carefully blended and the dressing forms a pleasing har- 
mony in its general effect. 

Ladies of a medium size may, perhaps, wear a dress with 
large figures, plaids, or stripes, if the prevailing fashions 
allow it ; but either large or small ladies would scarcely be 
in taste to wear either. Much drapery is not becoming to 
a short and stout person, while one who is slender may be 
improved in appearance by drapery. Then, as to tints : it is 
well known that fair complexions require delicate tints, while 
brunettes require rich, dark shades. 

Dresses should be carefully fitted to the form, yet not so 
that the natural functions of the body be impeded. Give 
nature room to move and breathe, and many a painful ex- 
perience in bodily suffering will be prevented. By all means 
avoid tight belts about the waist. The dress should be be- 
coming, and it will then be in taste. It should not be so 
noticeable that special attention would be attracted to it. 
To be entirely out of fashion is to be eccentric, yet a true 
independence will not lead to a servile following of every 
fashionable folly in dress that may appear. To be indiffer- 
ent to .one's proper appearance is a sign of indolence and 
slovenliness. 

There should be consistency in dress. That is, there 
should be regard to one's circumstances in life, so that what 
cannot be afforded without pecuniary embarrassment never 
should be worn. The dress should be in harmony with the 
occasion. A ball-dress at a funeral would not be more out 
of place than the rich toilette of the drawing-room is found 
to be when chosen for a walking-suit. 

But if there is one place more than another where great 
elegance and showiness of dress are out of taste, it is in the 



538 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY, 

House of God, where all should meet in equal humility 
before Him in whose sight outward adornment passes for 
nothing. Paley says, " If ever the poor man holds up his head, 
it is at church ; if ever the rich man views him with respect, it 
is there, and both will be the better, and the public profited, 
the oftener they meet in a situation in which the conscious- 
ness of dignity in the one is tempered and mitigated, and 
the spirit of the -other erected and confirmed." 

Regard should also be had to one's pursuits and sur- 
roundings. A business attire should be neat and not 
showy ; its material serviceable and of a sober color. A 
traveling attire should be such as will furnish comfort and 
protection from dust and dirt ; soft neutral tints and smooth 
surface are best. Anything which would attract special 
attention from fellow-travelers should be scrupulously 
avoided. 

MOURNING ATTIRE. 

Where persons wear mourning for style rather than feel- 
ing, they will consult the fashion of. the day. Deep 
mourning requires the heaviest black material with crape 
collar and cuffs. Ruffles, bows, and flounces are inadmis- 
sible. The bonnet must be of black crape ; the veil of crape 
or barege with heavy border ; black gloves and black- 
bordered handkerchiefs ; jet pins and buckles ; no jewels. A 
widow wears mourning for two years ; for a parent or child, 
mourning is worn for one year ; for a grandparent, mourning 
is worn for six months ; the same for a brother or sister ; 
for an uncle or aunt, nephew or niece, three months. 
There are some good people, however, who from principle 
never on any occasion allow themselves to wear mourning 
habiliments, believing the practice to be contrary to a 
Christian faith. Aside from this exception ladies should 
always wear black dresses at funerals, and in this excep- 
tional case plain dresses are always worn.

PERFUMES. 

It may be that some will think a perfume of some sort is 
essential to complete the toilet. " The most refined people, 
however, avoid personal perfumes, and hold that the absence 
of all odor is the best savor of human communion. Those 
of nice taste eschew all perfumes but those that are evanes- 
cent, such as cologne and the like." A strong perfume of 
any kind is not desirable, if, indeed, it be not actually vul- 
gar. There is always a suggestion that it conceals some 
foulness. 

POLITENESS AT HOME. 

We come now to consider Polite Deportment in the 
domain of home, which ought to be to us the most sacred 
and beautiful place on earth. It may be said in general that 
it is the duty of every member of a family to do all that is 
possible to promote the happiness of the other members. 
It is necessary, therefore, to bear and forbear; to make 
mutual concessions ; to keep down selfishness ; to cultivate 
a love of justice and honor; to get rid of our petty likes 
and dislikes ; to conquer and control our temper. Much 
may be done by a nice attention to the requirements of 
etiquette, by an observance of those laws which govern the 
decencies and proprieties of life. There is no reason why 
a husband should not treat his wife with exquisite polite- 
ness ; why a wife should not remember that her husband 
has a claim to be treated like a gentleman ; why the finest 
manners should not be observed by brothers and sisters. 
This mutual courtesy, inspired by mutual love, would purify 
the atmosphere of home, and invest with a new dignity 
our domestic relations. 

A DOMESTIC PICTURE. 

Suppose we present a single day in such a home as might 
exist anywhere. It is early morning. An understood signal 



540 ^^^ HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

indicates the time for breakfast to be reasonably near. Plans 
carefully made require that the family come together at the 
morning meal promptly, that the happiness of each may be 
conserved. Sufficient time is taken to become suitably 
attired to meet the household, and to so arrange the sleep- 
ing-room that no one need hesitate to enter lest sense and 
taste may be offended. Everything is left in good order. 
The washstand or basin is emptied ; the towels properly 
hung up ; the bed-clothing turned over the foot-board ; arti- 
cles of wearing apparel not in use, put away. Without 
haste or perturbation the family meet in the dining-room 
and sit down together ; grace is said ; hot and savory food 
is brought on ; cheerful conversation seasons the hour ; re- 
spect is shown to parents and superiors ; the servants are 
treated with kind consideration ; sufficient time is secured 
for the purposes of the meal by planning for it, hence there 
is no bolting of food and rushing off in disorder to meet a 
train or to get to business in due season. 

Either at the end or the centre sits father, perhaps carv- 
ing the steak, but certainly making himself useful, as well 
as ornamental. Opposite is the serene-faced mother, justly 
proud of her honorable position. On one side perhaps the 
aged grandmother, giving her meed of sunshine to the 
board. The prattle of children's voices mingles occasionally 
in conversation. In honor each prefers the other, and all 
contribute to the peace and glory of the home. 

The personal habits, of which so full mention has already 
been made, now show their effects. The politeness which 
begins in personal conditions is now working outwardly. 
There are no slovens here — there could not be. Gentleness 
and civility rule the hour. Why should they not be more 
marked at home than anywhere else ? There is not a word 
of slander or defamation. Peace toward each other ; charity 
toward all. Hans Christian Andersen's stoiy of the cobweb 
cloth, so finely woven that it was invisible, and specially 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 54 J^ 

made for the King's garment, stands perhaps for the sweet 
manners which are the fine and kingly clothing of royal 
souls. 

Domestic duties for the day follow the morning repast. 
Father is away at business, the children at school, and the 
elder ones of the household fully occupied. There is found 
time for healthful reading, for the good wife has early 
learned that she must not fall behind her husband or chil- 
dren in personal and religious culture. Both, in their deal- 
ing with the world of people and the world of books, are 
constantly growing. She must keep up with them or lose 
their genuine respect. Moreover, she must be able to 
direct the tastes of her family in reading, that they may be 
fitted for cultivated society, and be enabled thereby to do 
well their parts in life. The best literature of the day has 
place upon table or shelf, and is read with pleasure and 
profit. 

Perhaps one of the family is ill. The soft tread and gen- 
tle care show that politeness is not wanting in extremity 
and in bodily suffering. There is no slamming of doors ; 
no boisterous talking ; no disregard of a single thing which 
relates to the comfort of the invalid. A due regard for the 
sufferer leads to a gentle tap at the door before entering ; 
the ignoring of little things which are not agreeable in the 
sick one's surroundings or condition ; and patience in the 
rendering of such attentions as may be needed ; with an 
affectionate interest born of a really good heart. 

The shadows are creeping on apace as the day draws to 
its close, and the family is now gathered for dinner. It is 
thought worth their while for each to be in becoming attire, 
to dress for each other quite as neatly as if the outside 
world were looking- on. There is true p-race and beautiful 
simplicity. The *' shop " is left behind. Markets, bonds, 
stocks, worry and fret, are not brought home at the close of 
the business day. Conversation does not lag. There is 



542 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

room for each to have part, and what some might think the 
trivial things in children's experience receive their meed of 
attention and honor. There is no slang ; no impolite lan- 
guage ; no " street talk ;" no reference to disgusting sub- 
jects. The family sit naturally erect, without lounging or 
appearing to be tired. Elbows are not planted on the table ; 
napkins are not adjusted under the chin like bibs; no one 
appears to be greedy for food, neither is there any dainti- 
ness that is unsuitable. There is no effort to talk while the 
mouth is full. There is no coughing, or sneezing, or other 
disgusting noises with nose or mouth. The knife is only 
used to cut the food, while the fork and spoon are used to 
convey food to the mouth. Great care is taken that the 
tablecloth be not soiled. The carving is done neatly, ex- 
peditiously, and courteously. There is neither a niggardly 
supply nor an overloading of plates. It seems as if carving 
were no trouble, and that it gave pleasure to supply what- 
ever is desired by any one at the table. 

If any little accident happens, no notice is taken of it — 
no frowns, no muttering of reproof The servants share in 
the politeness. ** Please" is not omitted when a request is 
made. A " thank you " is not infrequent. The quietness 
of the meal is not broken by noises made by mastication, or 
smacking the lips, or gulping of liquids. When the meal 
is concluded, the whole family rise from the table, and now 
the *' children's hour " is in order. 

The children have learned that there is a time to play 
and a time when not to play, as well as how to play without^ 
interfering with the enjoyment of others. There is kindness, 
:good temper, and politeness. There are no rude and offen- 
sive practical jokes perpetrated. There is universal mirth 
and cheerfulness ; there is gayety and life. When the 
proper hour arrives for the children to retire there is neither 
teasing nor sulks. A beautiful night closes upon a beauti- 
ful day for them in the home and the good-night kiss blesses 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 543 

each in order. If friends call, they are made welcome, and 
the evening is spent no less pleasantly than the day was 
begun. It is all the result of good nature and good man- 
agement, combined with good sense and religious principle. 
An eminent authority in household etiquette says : " Let 
no one suppose that because a good wife lives in a small 
house and dines on homely fare the general principles of 
polite deportment do not apply to her. A small house is 
more easily kept clean than a palace. Taste may be quite 
as well displayed in the arrangement of dishes on a pine 
table as in grouping the silver and china of the rich. Skill 
in cooking is as readily shown in a baked potato or johnny- 
cake as in a canvas-back duck. The charm of good house- 
keeping lies in a nice attention to little things, not in a 
superabundance. A dirty kitchen and bad cooking have 
driven many a husband and son, and many a daughter, too, 
from a home that should have been a refuge from tempta- 
tion. Bad dinners go hand in hand with total depravity, 
while a properly fed man is already half saved." 

AWAY FROM HOME. 

If people are well bred at home, their deportment when 
away from home, in ordinary social intercourse, will be such 
as befits the true gentleman or lady. They will then reflect 
the home life. But, being in the homes of others, there will 
be certain formalities and restraints which are essential to 
the comfort or rights of those whom they may meet. These 
sjiould always be recognized and regarded. A careful 
observance of them will also promote your own comfort and 
well-being. 

INTRODUCTIONS. 

Introductions, more or less formal, are necessary. They 
may form the basis of enjoyment for a brief period, or of a 
lasting friendship. It is usually the way by which parties 
become acquainted. Sometimes persons are obliged to 



544 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR V. 

introduce themselves, and in such cases, unless well known 
by reputation, there may be some risk in forming an 
acquaintance. No one will presume on an acquaintance so 
formed unless it is accepted in the most unmistakable 
manner. 

It is not necessary to introduce a friend to every one you 
meet, without regard to time or place. This must, however, 
depend upon the good sense of the parties concerned. It 
might be very rude not to introduce a friend, even though 
the parties so introduced might never meet again. As a 
rule, we should always be sure that an introduction would 
be mutually desirable ; hence, one should never introduce 
a gentleman to a lady, for instance, without first obtaining 
her consent. An introduction of any kind implies an 
indorsement of character. It is right sometimes to decline 
giving an introduction where there is the least doubt of the 
propriety of so doing. 

Gentlemen, whatever their rank, should be presented to 
ladies ; young men to elderly men ; young women to 
elderly women ; those of lower rank to persons of higher 
rank. When a gentleman is introduced to another gentle- 
man, each offers a hand ; when a gentleman is introduced 
to a lady, he should wait for her to offer her hand. If she 
does not do so, he must be content with a bow. 

At dinner-parties general introductions are unnecessary ; 
though it is to be assumed that you would not seat at the 
same table persons whom you would not wish to know each 
other. In sending your guests down to 'dinner you must, 
of course, introduce the lady to her destined partner, if they 
happen to be unacquainted. In this case you do not ask 
the lady's permission. At morning calls, if the callers 
arrive at the same time the hostess will introduce them to 
each other, unless she has good grounds for believing that 
the introduction would be disagreeable or unsuitable. At 
*' five-o'clock teas " and similar receptions the hostess must 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 545 

introduce her principal guests to each other ; but in doing 
so she must exercise a due discretion and assort her guests 
with all possible discrimination. 

Between gentlemen the form of introduction may be very 
simple, as : " Mr. A., my friend, Mr. B.," where the parties 
are of equal station in life and about the same age. Other- 
wise, it is better to say: " Mr. A., allow me to introduce 
my friend, Mr. B." As a means of starting conversation 
and so placing both parties at their ease, a remark should 
be added, explaining the business, or residence, or any other 
item which may be considered of interest, especially if the 
party introduced is on a trip for business or pleasure. 

An introduction to a lady should always be more formal. 
The usual way is to bow to the lady, or slightly wave the 
hand, and say : " Mrs. B., permit me to introduce my 
friend, Mr. D. ;" or, in case an introduction has been 
sought : " Mrs. B., I take pleasure in presenting my friend, 
Mr. D." The precise form is immaterial, so that the proper 
order be observed. The introduction should be recognized 
by each bowing to the other and each repeating the other's 
name. The gentleman should say : " I am glad to have the 
pleasure of meeting you," or something of similar import. 

It is hardly necessary to say that the names of the parties 
should always be uttered distinctly. If either party fails to 
understand the name of the other, it is proper to say : " I 
beg your pardon ; I did not understand the name ;" where- 
upon it should be repeated. 

When several are to be introduced to one person, the 
name of the latter should be distinctly spoken, and then the 
names of the parties introduced should be mentioned in 
succession, with a slight bow as each name is called. 
Where relatives are introduced, care should be taken to 
givelDoth the degree of kinship and the name. For instance : 
" My father, Mr. C. ;" or, " My son, Mr. C." One's wife is 
simply designated as ** Mrs. A." 



546 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

It is proper always to recognize the title of one who is 
introduced— as, " Rev. Mr. A. ;" or, " Rev. Dr. B. ;" or, 
" Honorable Mr. C," if the party is a Congressman ; or, 
" Senator J.," and so on. Sometimes a complimentary 
remark may be well — as, " Mr. Jones, whose recent work 
on esthetics has given us so much pleasure." 

An adherence to etiquette is a mark of respect. If a man 
be worth knowing, he is surely worth the trouble of ap- 
proaching properly. It will likewise relieve you from the 
awkwardness of being acquainted with people of whom you 
might at times be ashamed, or be obliged under any circum- 
stances to " cut." Take care not to know anybody whom 
you will be obliged to " cut." ** Cutting " is simply declin- 
ing to recognize a person to whom you have previously 
been introduced. It may be done direct by a cold look, as 
if to an entire stranger ; or indirectly, by averting the face 
on passing and not returning, by word or manner, an offered 
salutation. 

SALUTATIONS AND GREETINGS. 

Salutations and greetings are very simple among Ameri- 
cans. The most common phrases are ** Good morning," 
** Good afternoon," " Good evening," " How are you ?" and 
*' How do you do ?" Some people simply say *' Howdy ?" 
or " How d'ye ?" but the latter never should be indulged in 
except between intimate friends ; it is perhaps not in taste 
at any time. A pleasant smile and slight bow is desirable 
as ah accompaniment to the words spoken. The most 
affectionate form of salution is the kiss, which is only proper 
among near relatives and dear friends. The practice of 
women kissing each other in public is held to be decidedly 
vulgar, and had better be avoided. A due respect to child- 
hood ought to prevent the liberty so often taken of kissing 
young girls who, though mortified, dare not resent it. There 
is no more propriety in kissing a child without its consent 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 547 

than there is of kissing a grown woman under the same cir- 
cumstances. 

HAND-SHAKING. 

With regard to hand-shaking, a few suggestions may 
cover the points that are worthy of remembrance. It is not 
well to offer to shake hands with every one in a drawing- 
room; if the host or hostess offers a hand, take it'; a bow 
will do for the rest. Hand-shaking is not admissible in a 
formal party or ball-room. The initiative, in hand-shaking, 
must always come from the lady, from the elder to the 
younger, and from the one higher in rank. But in no case 
let there be the " mutilated courtesy," as Goldsmith calls 
it, in which by the touch of one or two fingers in a pre- 
tended hand-shaking a mere mockery of civility is rendered 
in place of true courtesy. 

Remember that there is a right and a wrong way of 
hand-shaking. It is horrible when your unoffending digits 
are seized in the sharp compress of a kind of vise, and 
wrung and squeezed until you feel as if they were reduced 
to jelly. It is not less horrible when you find them lying in 
a limp, nerveless clasp, which makes no response to your 
hearty greeting, but chills you like a lump of ice. Shake 
hands as if you meant it, swiftly, strenuously, and courte- 
ously, neither using an undue pressure nor falling wholly 

supine. 

UNDUE FAMILIARITY. 

" Familiarity breeds contempt." Some forms of famili- 
arity are positively odious, such as slapping your friend on 
the back or nudging him in the side. Such practices should 
never be indulged in or permitted. Indeed, there need be 
no occasion, as a rule, to touch people at all when you have 
occasion to address them. Again, some persons behave in 
a drawing-room as if they were the only guests, and the 
remainder of the company had been assembled to admire — 
at a distance — their intimacy with the hostess. This is an 



548 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

assumption of familiarity and a token of ill breeding. The 
same may be said of retaining upon the head one's hat in 
a strictly private office, which is no more justifiable than it 
would be to wear it in a drawing-room. 

Closely related to this latter is the loud and boisterous 
laugh, which is decidedly vulgar. A hearty laugh is pleas- 
ing, but a loud guffaw is never necessary in order to show 
heartiness, any more than a loud tone in talking is agree- 
able to the listener. 

There are many other acts which may be classed as vul- 
gar. Among these are humming and whistling ; standing 
with arms a-kimbo ; lounging and yawning ; addressing 
acquaintances by their Christian names ; playing practical 
jokes, and whispering in the presence of others. Yet 
there should not be diffidence and embarrassment in asso- 
ciating with either equals or superiors. For instance, there 
is a great art in entering a room. Some persons stride in 
with a shamefaced air, as if they thought they had no busi- 
ness across the threshold ; others swagger in defiantly, 
with head erect and chest expanded, like a professional 
athlete making his appearance before his " patrons ;" others, 
again, steal in noiselessly, as if deprecating the slightest 
attention, and priding themselves on their humility. Enter 
a room as if you felt yourself entitled to a welcome, but 
wished to take no undue advantage of it. 

Having entered the room, one need not be in great haste 
to get into a chair. It may be as graceful, easy, and proper 
to stand for a while, and converse easily while in that atti- 
tude, yet a chair should be accepted when offered. 

CONVERSATION. 

The art of conversation is one which boasts of a sacred 
charter : " Iron sharpeneth iron ; so a man sharpeneth 
the countenance of his friend ;" " As in water face answereth 
to face, so the heart of man to man." (Proverbs xxvii, 17, 19.) 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 549 

It is not possible to teach the art of conversation. On the 
other hand, it is not difficult to lay down certain general 
rules, the observance of which must be held as indispen- 
sable to the comfort of the company in which one finds 
himself. 

For example, elaborate discussions of political and relig- 
ious subjects must be avoided. Our differences on these 
points go very deep, and any debate which forces them on 
our consideration cannot fail to awaken permanent feelings 
of irritation and dislike. 

However much in the right, yield with a good grace 
when you perceive that persistence in ventilating your 
opinions will result in open variance. The true spirit of 
conversation consists less in displaying one's own cleverness 
than in bringing out the cleverness of other people. Con- 
versation is the pasture-ground of the many, therefore it 
should keep to the levels. There are very few who can 
ascend the heights, and none ought to sink into the depths. 

Gesticulate as little as you can while speaking. Some 
people spread out their fingers like fans ; others point 
them at you menacingly, like so many darts ; this man 
emphasizes his speech by bringing down one unfortunate 
hand into the palm of the other ; that man nods his head 
like a child's toy figure, and carries his arm up and down 
like a pump-handle. 

When any one is speaking do not yawn, nor hum an air, 
nor pick the teeth, nor drum with the fingers on a piece of 
furniture, nor whisper in a neighbor's ear, nor take a letter 
out of the pocket and read it, nor look at your watch. 

There is no flattery so exquisite as " the flattery of listen- 
ing." It may be doubted whether the greatest mind is ever 
proof against it. Socrates may have loved Plato best of all 
his disciples because he listened best. To listen well is 
almost as indispensable as to talk well, and it is by the skill 
with which he listens that the man of bon ton and of good 



550 THE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

society is known. If you wish people to listen to you, you 
must listen to them. Let not your patience give way when 
elderly people are garrulous. Respect old age, even when 
it twaddles ; you yourself may live to require the indul- 
gence which you are now recommended to exercise. 

There are social Munchausens whose narratives make 
tremendous demands on your credulity. Do not express 
your belief in what you disbelieve, for that would be to 
utter a falsehood ; do not express an open dissent, for that 
would be to commit a rudeness. Take refuge in a courte- 
ous silence, and — change the subject. 

Be careful how you exercise your wit. If curses, like 
chickens, come home to roost, so do epigrams. Do not 
applaud the wit which is leveled at your friend ; it may next 
be directed against yourself Do not give another, even if 
it be a better, version of a story already told by one of your 
companions. Be careful how you distribute praise or blame 
to your neighbors — some of those present will have their 
prejudices or partialities, which you will be sure to offend — 
and on no account interrupt or contradict a person who may 
be speaking. 

Speak of yourself as little as possible. If you speak in 
praise, you expose yourself to ridicule ; if you blame your- 
self, nobody will think you in earnest, and it will be assumed 
that you are seeking for compliments, or that you are 
merely affecting humility ; or if your vanity be excused, it 
will be at the expense of your intelligence — if you are not 
vain, you must be stupid. 

Do not " talk shop," that is, unless specially requested ; 
do not talk of your professional occupafion, your private 
studies, or your personal belongings, neither of your house, 
nor your wife, nor your servant, nor your property. 

Do not pay compliments unless you can do so with grace, 
and in such a manner that, though the person on whom 
the sweet flattery is bestowed recognize it as undeserved, 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 55I 

he or she may still believe that on your part it is perfectly 
sincere. Dean Swift says pithily : " Nothing is so great 
an instance of ill-manners as flattery. If you flatter all the 
company you please none ; if you flatter only one or two 
you affront the rest." But an elegant compliment at an 
opportune moment, and spoken with an air of frankness, 
carries with it an irresistible charm. 

To be a good talker requires much general information, 
which may be acquired by observation, reading and study, 
and listening to others. To this must be added a good 
memory, which can be cultivated by proper effort ; a right 
knowledge and use of language, and clear enunciation. 
The use of such vulgarisms as " awfully nice," '* abominably 
horrid," " dreadfully stupid," and the like, are always to be 
avoided. It is a bad habit which is very close to untruth- 
fulness. Very few people would utter a willful lie, yet 
many become untrustworthy because of their habit of 
exaggeration and false coloring. 

FORMAL CALLS. 

The formal call is a mere device for keeping up acquaint- 
ance. Once or twice a year is regarded as sufficiently often 
to meet fashionable requirements. Simply sending cards 
sometimes takes the place of a call. A " morning call " 
means generally any call made in the daytime, and is a 
mere matter of ceremony. It should not be made in the 
forenoon, nor just previous to the usual hour of luncheon, 
nor later than five in the afternoon. Local customs govern 
the matter of special days for receiving calls. 

When a lady for any reason prefers not to see callers, 
the servant is usually instructed to say that she is engaged, 
or " not at home." As the latter is not strictly correct, a 
regard to truthfulness should prevent the statement. A 
polite mention that the lady could not receive callers ought 
to be sufficient To insist on seeing a person after such a 
35 



552 ^-^-^ ^^^ USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

message is the height of ill-manners on the part of the 
caller. 

In making a morning call a gentleman should take hat 
and gloves with him into the parlor, but not his umbrella or 
his overshoes, and he should not remove his overcoat. In 
an evening call, all wraps, etc., should be left in the hall. 
While waiting for the person on whom you have called it is 
not right to walk about, examining pictures and other 
articles. A morning call should always be short, and one 
should not enter upon a subject of conversation which may 
terrify the hostess with the apprehension that you intend to 
remain until you have exhausted it. 

In calling on a newly married couple, do not congratulate 
the lady upon her marriage, but the bridegroom. He, of 
course, is fortunate in having found any one to accept him ; 
her good luck may be more problematical. A visit to a 
newly married couple is not a visit of condolence. Be brisk 
in your manner, therefore ; wear a smile ; and if there be a 
feeling of pity at your heart, do your utmost to prevent its 
outward manifestation. 

When ready to leave, arise and go. Do not linger and 
talk and act as if you wished you had not started. Make 
your adieus and depart at once — yet not in haste. If there 
are other callers, bow to them collectively. 

After a party or dinner at a friend's house you should call 
within a week thereafter. 

VISITING. 

Visiting is a privilege that is often abused. Only firm 
friendship can justify it. One should not be too fast to ac- 
cept an invitation — certainly not a mere " come and see us 
some time." Be sure that you are really wanted, and do 
not prolong your stay until your welcome is clean worn out. 
During a visit one should conform very strictly to the usual 
Jiabit^ of the house, always being on hand and ready at the 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 553 

usual times for meals, and never keep the family up after 
their, usual time for retiring. If unpleasant matters appear 
they should not be noticed, and in general one's presence 
ought to be the least possible occasion of trouble. Upon 
returning home, the family should receive a pleasant letter, 
renewing expressions of pleasure given when about to take 
leave of the hostess. 

VISITING-CARDS. 

As cards have so important a place in etiquette, it will be 
-well to consult a reliable stationer as to styles in order to 
avoid mistakes. The neat round-hand and angular script 
has of late taken the place of old English type on cards. 
Only the name should be on a card. A business card never 
should be used for a friendly call. A physician may put 
" Dr." or " M. D." in addition to his name, and an Army or 
Navy officer his rank and branch of service. 

In case a card is left in person when making a call, one 
corner should be turned down if for the lady of the house ; 
if folded in the middle, it will indicate that the call is on 
several members of the family. A card should be left for 
each guest of the family. 

" P. P. C." (Pour pi^endre conge) should be written in one 
corner of a card left at a farewell visit, before a protracted 
absence. Such cards may be sent by mail. Ladies about 
to be married sometimes send them in place of making a 
call. 

An expert in the science of good manners has recently 
spoken thus on visiting-cards : *' Care should be taken to 
conform with present usage and to avoid anything con- 
sidered to be in questionable taste, for a card is the repre- 
sentative of one's-self To the unrefined or underbred 
person the visiting-card is but a trifling and insignificant 
piece of paper ; but to the cultured disciple of social law it 
conveys a subtle and unmistakable intelligence. Its texture, 



554: THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Style of engraving, and even the hour of leaving it, combine 
to place tne stranger whose name it bears in a pleasant or a 
disagreeable attitude — even before his manners, conversa- 
tion, and face have been able to explain his social position. 
The higher the civilization of a community, the more careful 
it is to preserve the elegance of its social forms. It is quite 
as easy to express a perfect breeding in the fashionable for- 
malities of cards as by any other method, and perhaps, 
indeed, it is the safest herald of an invitation for a stranger. 
Its texture should be fine, its engraving a plain script, its 
size neither too small, so that its recipients shall say to 
themselves, * A whimsical person,' nor too large, to suggest 
ostentation. Refinement seldom touches extremes in any- 
thing." 

RECEPTIONS. 

Receptions usually occur from four to seven in the after- 
noon, when light refreshments are served. Invitations to 
them are usually informal. If " R. S. V. P." is on a corner 
of such invitation it is proper to send answer. Otherwise, 
no answer is required. All who are invited are expected to 
call soon afterward — within two weeks at most. Invitations 
are generally issued in the name of the lady of the house, 
and are usually engraved in the lower left-hand corner of 
her visiting-card — thus :

POLITE DEPORTMEUT. 555 

If assisted by a daughter or a friend, the name of such 
assistant is engraved below her own on the card. Some- 
times the cards are larger and in the following form : 



Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jackson, 
AT HOME, 

Thui'sday, December sixth, 

From Three until Seven o'clock. 150 Tremont Ave. 



These cards, now used in square form, should be inclosed 
in two envelopes when sent by mail. If delivered by mes- 
sensfer, one inclosure is sufficient. 

DINNERS. 

The Etiquette of Dinners is worthy of more space than 
we can give to it. When an invited guest, be sure not to 
be late. It would be a wrong to your host, to other guests, 
and to the dinner. Persons invited should be of the same 
standing in society, though not necessarily acquaintances. 
Invitations should be in the name of the gentleman and 
lady of the house, and should be issued at least a week in 
advance. They should be answered immediately, in order 
that the hosts may know who are to be their guests. When 
an engagement has been made it should be kept, if at all 
possible. It is not proper to invite a gentleman without 
his wife, or vice versa, unless it be an occasion when gen- 
tlemen alone are to be present. The usual time for dinners 
is from five to eight o'clock. 

A dinner-table is said to be laid for so many " covers." 



556 ^^^^ ^^0 U^^ IVIFK S L IBRA R Y. 

A " cover " comprises : Two large knives ; three large forks ; 
silver knife and fork for fish; tablespoon for soup; wine- 
glass for sherry ; wine-glass for hock ; wine-glass for cham- 
pagne. Where wines are not used, of course the glasses 
are omitted. In the centre, between the knives and forks, 
is placed the dinner-bread wrapped up in a serviette. The 
dessertspoons and small forks are placed before the guests 
on an empty plate before the sweets are passed around, and 
extra knives, and forks are supplied as they are required. 

In the main things of a dinner, the fillet and roast, there 
is little change, but in minor things the caterer rules. To 
begin with oysters, five, not six, is now the fashionable num- 
ber for the half shells. At formal dinners it is the invariable 
rule that ladies and gentlemen should be seated alternately, 
never allowing two ladies or two gentlemen to sit together. 
At dinners of eight, twelve, or sixteen persons, this can be 
managed only by putting gentlemen at both ends of the * 
table. Hostesses generally have a prejudice against giving 
up their customary seat, forgetting the old saying : '* Where 
the Douglas sits, there is the head of the table," and avoid 
the awkward number. 

When there are more ladies than gentlemen at the din- 
ner-party, the hostess should go down alone, and leave the 
gentleman of highest rank to take down the lady of second 
rank ; in this case the gentleman will place himself at table 
on the right of the hostess. In passing from the drawing- 
room to the dining-room, remember that it is the lady who 
takes precedence, not the gentleman. 

A gentleman must help the lady whom he has escorted 
to the table, but it is not proper to offer his help to other 
ladies v/ho have escorts. If the guests pass the dishes, 
always help yourself before handing to the next. If at 
dinner you are requested to help any one to sauce, do not 
pour it over the meat or vegetables, but on one side. Ii 
you should have to carve and help a joint, do not load a 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. . 557 

person's plate — it is vulgar ; also, in serving soup, one 
ladleful to each plate is sufficient. 

Conversation at the table should be participated in by all, 
and should include only such subjects as will be agreeable 
to all. It is rudeness for one or two to monopolize the 
talking, and centre upon themselves a general attention. 

When the guests have finished, the hostess can indicate, 
by rising, the time for departure from the table, when the 
return to the drawing-room can be in the order in which 
they are seated without regard to preference. 

AFTER DINNER. 

An hour or more of social intercourse will follow. It 
will be well if some of the company are musicians. In 
case one is invited to sing or play there should be graceful 
compliance, but it is not well to sing or play more than one 
piece unless specially urged. It is better not to risk boring 
the company with your performance, however good it may 
be. When people are singing, do them the courtesy of 
listening, or pretending to listen. If you do not like music 
yourself, remember that others may. Besides, when a per- 
son is endeavoring to entertain you, the least you can do is 
to show your gratitude for the intention. 

Upon taking leave, express pleasure to the host and hos- 
tess, but do not offer thanks in any case. A call should be 
made soon afterward. 

Dinner cards are so useful that they will not soon go out 
of fashion. The shops are full of them, and beautiful ones 
are coming over from Paris. Of a dozen recently used the 
owner said : " They cost almost as much as a dress." 
Each fan was painted and signed by a well-known artist, 
and bore the name of a guest. They suggested the lavish- 
ness of LucuUus in ancient times, and in modern that 
famous bonanza banquet in San Francisco, where every 
lady's dinner card was a point lace handkerchief

MARRIAGE ANNIVERSARIES. 

Marriage anniversaries are popularly designated as fol- 
lows : 

First Anniversary, Paper Wedding. 

Second " Cotton 

Third " Leather " 

Fifth " Wooden " 

Tenth " Tin 

Fifteenth " ..... Crystal " 

Twentieth " Floral " 

Twenty-fifth" ..... Silver 

Thirtieth " Pearl " 

Thirty-fifth " China 

Fortieth " Coral " 

Forty-fifth " Bronze " 

Fiftieth " Golden " 

Sixtieth " Diamond " 

It is proper to say that some of these, in the preceding 
list, are not often celebrated. Cards of wood, tin, etc., are no 
longer used, the invitations being issued on square white 
cards or note sheets, in plain, neat script. The words " No 
Gifts," are often engraved in the lower left-hand corner of 
the invitation. The ceremonies on such occasions are some- 
what according to the taste and desire of the parties and 
the length of time they may have been married. The ear- 
lier occasions afford opportunities for merriment ; the later 
ones, for the deeper emotions, mingled with pleasure and 
satisfaction. 

COURTSHIP. 

With regard to courtship, it may briefly be said that its 
freedom should not be abused by license, and that the par- 
ties ought to regard each other sacredly if their troth is 
plighted. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 559 

Upon engagement, the gentleman presents the lady with 
a ring, to be worn on the third finger of the right hand. 
While engaged, neither party should be occupied in flirta- 
tions with the opposite sex, yet both should reasonably 
mingle in society. The gentleman is always thereafter the 
legitimate escort of the lady and should not devote himself 
in any marked manner to any other lady. 

Society wisely discourages all conspicuous manifestations 
of personal feeling. Lovers are not expected to '* make 
love " in public, nor married couples to afford extravagant 
evidence of conjugal tenderness ; and the sincerity of the 
affection may reasonably be doubted which parades itself in 
public. When our hearts are deeply moved we do not take 
the world into our confidence. On the other hand, constant 
bickering and bantering between husbarTd and wife in public 
is equally objectionable, even though it be only " in fun." 

WEDDINGS. 

The etiquette of weddings varies greatly according to 
circumstances. After invitations are issued the lady does 
not appear in public. The invitations should be handsomely 
engraved. Any reputable stationer will be able to suggest 
the proper forms and styles. The invitations are engraved 
in the name of the father and mother of the bride, or if 
neither are living, then in the name of her guardian or near- 
est relation. 

The forms and ceremonies of weddings are generally in 

accordance with the wishes of the bride. But, whether the 

wedding ceremonies be at home or in church, a beautiful 

simplicity is certainly more pleasing than an ostentatious 

display. 

PUBLIC PLACES. 

Proper regard is necessary to the rules of polite deport- 
ment in public places. . Let your walk in life be distinguished 
by unassuming grace. Look from your window and observe 



560 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the gait of the passers-by. You will see at once *' what to 
avoid " — the tread of the grenadier, the clumsy shuffle, the 
dancing-master's trip, the heel-and-toe movement, the pre- 
tentious slide. But it is easier to know what to avoid than 
what to imitate. Perhaps imitation is not advisable, and the 
chief thing to remember is that you should walk as if your 
body had a soul in it. Virgil tells us of Juno that you saw 
the goddess in her gait, and " grace in her steps " is one of 
the characteristics of Milton's " Eve." 

Observation, which, *' with extensive view, surveys man- 
kind from China to Peru," shows that in the country gentle- 
men do not offer their arm to ladies, but in large towns this 
should be done as a measure of protection and a token of 
respect. 

When you meet a friend in the street it must depend on 
your degree of intimacy whether you walk with him or not ; 
but with a lady you must not walk, unless she directly or 
indirectly invite you. 

Gentlemen do not takeoff their hats to one another; this 
is a courtesy reserved for the ladies. Gentlemen generally 
recognize each other with a nod. If you pass an acquaint- 
ance with a lady on his arm, do not nod; take off your hat, 
so that your salute may seem to embrace both your friend 
and the lady. In bowing to a lady in the street, lift your 
hat right off your head. Don't allow her to suppose that 
you wear a wig and are afraid to disarrange it. If you pass 
a friend with a lady whom you do not know, you must lift 
your hat to him and not nod. 

Should you tread upon or stumble against any one, do 
not fail to make immediate apology. Of course, you will 
not stare at nor point to people, nor carry umbrella or cane 
horizontally under your arm. Neither will you stop a lady 
on the street to talk with her. Turn and walk with her, 
rather, and lift your hat to her when you have finished the 
conversation and are about to leave her. 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 5gx 

It Is very rude to rush for a seat in a car or at a public 
entertainment. Better lose some comfort than be guilty of 
impoliteness. It is equally wrong to occupy more space 
than you are entitled to in a public conveyance ; and when 
at a place of amusement to disturb others by your conver- 
sation or remarks while the performance is going on is 
gross ill-breeding. A polite person will always have regard 
for the comfort of those who are near. 

In public halls a gentleman should precede the lady 
whose escort he is, unless there is an usher preceding them. 
He should give her the inner seat and remain by her side. 
He is under no obligation to give up his seat to another 
lady and should avoid everything that might attract notice 
to himself or his companion. 

In church there should always be deference and respect 
to the worshipers, whether or not you agree with them. 
Stay away if you cannot be respectful and attentive to the 
services. It is not right to go late, to the possible disturb- 
ance of the worship. It is rude to turn around and gaze at 
any one, to watch people coming in with critical glances, to 
talk or laugh, and so disturb others, or to leave until the 
dismission. 

TRAVELING. 

In our country almost every one travels, and a few hints 
will be serviceable to those who may not have traveled a 
great deal. Always keep your head and arms inside the 
car window. Remember that it is not necessary to be in- 
trusive in order to be polite. Take your time in getting on 
or off the cars ; nothing is gained by haste. Avoid being 
boisterous and do not try to make yourself conspicuous. 
Never disclose your business to the stranger in whose com- 
pany you may happen to be. 

Bear in mind that the comfort of others should be taken 
into consideration when you travel. Your open window 
may be a source of great annoyance and discomfort to your 



5G2 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

neighbors. Do not litter the seat you occupy with boxes 
and bundles to exclude other passengers from sharing with 
you the accommodation it affords. Respectfully decline 
any and all invitations extended by strangers with whom 
you are brought in contact to indulge in social games of 
cards. Do not ask the conductor foolish questions about 
the route ; remember that he is not familiar with the run- 
ning-time of all the roads in the United States. Do not 
address a lady who is unknown to you, unless she invite it. 
You may offer her your newspaper with a silent bow. An 
'* unprotected " lady ought to call forth a gentleman's finest 
chivalry. 

If you have made some slight acquaintance with a lady 
in a railway carriage, you must not presume upon that to 
bow or speak to her at any accidental rencontre, unless she 
makes the first advances. 

Discretion should be used in forming acquaintances while 
traveling. Ladies may accept small and proper attentions, 
but any attempt at familiarity should be checked at once. 
A true gendeman will not offer any familiarity. The flirt- 
ing and freedom often indulged in by young people in public 
conveyances is unworthy of them — if, indeed, it does not 
indicate low breeding, and often leads to evil consequences. 
Whether at home or abroad, the same rules of good be- 
havior should prevail. 

CORRESPONDENCE. 

Correspondence is the medium by which people com- 
municate with each other when, for any reason, they cannot 
readily speak face to face. It should be characterized by 
the same politeness that marks the gentleman or lady in any 
relation of life. It will generally indicate character with 
considerable precision, unless there is studied concealment 
for a purpose. *' It is as great a violation of propriety to 
send a carelessly prepared and badly written letter as it is to 



POLITE DEPORTMENT, 5^3 

appear in the company of refined people with swaggering 
gait, soiled linen, and unkempt hair." It is at least a ques- 
tionable compliment to a friend to send a letter written with 
very pale ink, or with lines crossed and indistinct, or with 
other evidences of disregard of the objects which you are 
supposed to have had in mind when writing — namely, to 
communicate information in a pleasant way. It is not in 
taste for you to use postal cards, except on mere matters of 
business. When used, there is no need of any address, ex- 
cept upon the address side. You may omit the usual 
formalities of salutation in your communication, giving the 
post office and date at the top, and simply sign your name 
at the bottom. Postal cards never should be used for any 
matters that are in the least degree confidential. 

Private and personal letters should never be written on 
foolscap paper. What is known as "Commercial Note" is 
generally used by gentlemen, and a smaller size by ladies. 
Either ruled or plain paper is allowable, but the latter is 
deemed more in style. Envelopes should correspond with 
the paper used, and should always be of a light color, when 
ladies are addressed. Business letters are almost uniformly 
written on half-sheets, but for a social letter a whole sheet 
should always be used, though only a portion be occupied. 
The writing should be plain, without flourishes, and be con- 
tinuous to the close without skipping a page. The inside 
address, following the date, should be such as the party 
named is entitled to receive, and the salutation such as is jus- 
tified by the personal relations of the writer. Business let- 
ters generally begin with Sir, Dear Sir, Sirs, or Gentlemen. 
Do not use " Gents " for gentlemen, nor " Dr." for dear. 
For a letter addressed to a married woman, or a single 
woman not young, the proper salutation is Madam, Dear 
Madam, or My dear Madam. Business letters to a young 
unmarried lady do not require any salutation, the name alone 
being regarded as sufficient. 



5(34 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

When your letter is written, it requires a respectful or 
affectionate conclusion and the signature. Business letters 
are generally closed with Yours, Yours truly ^ or Yo7irs re- 
spectfully. Social letters admit of a great variety of forms, 
according to the taste and feelings of the writer. Whatever 
else may be wanting in clearness, the signature should be 
plain, so that there may not be any chance for mistake in 
replying. It is proper and desirable that " Miss " or " Mrs." 
be prefixed to your signature when writing to strangers, 
that there may not be any doubt as to the manner of 
addressing a reply. 

When completed, your letter should be neatly and care- 
fully folded, so that the edges will be exactly even, and 
inclosed in the envelope prepared for it by a proper outside 
address or superscription. The proper place for the postage 
stamp is the upper right-hand corner, and the stamp should 
be affixed squarely and head up. Postage should be fully 
paid. 

A letter should always have prompt reply. It is real 
incivility not to do so, especially if there be anything which 
specially calls for answer, and in beginning a reply the re- 
ception of the letter should be acknowledged, as a rule, in 
the first sentence. If for any reason a further correspon- 
dence is not desired, care should be taken to so write that 
there will not be anything calling for answer. It is well 
always to remember that your letter may sometime get into 
print without your knowledge or consent, therefore do not 
write a word that would bring a blush to your face if read 

by the world. 

NOTES. 

Notes may be considered as differing from letters in being 
more formal, in being generally written in the third person, 
,and being without signature. They are used for announce- 
ments, invitations, anniversaries, acceptances, regrets, and 
the like. For weddings, receptions, and other ceremonious 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 505 

occasions, your stationer will tell you the prevailing style. 
For acceptances and regrets, which should always be 
promptly made, the following models will suffice. They 
may be varied to suit the occasion and the relations of the 
parties :

NOTES OF INTRODUCTION. 

Notes of introduction should be brief, and contain the 
full name and address of the person introduced. For busi- 
ness purposes they are often used, but the receiver is not 



566 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

required to entertain the bearer as a friend unless entirely- 
agreeable. The obligation ceases with the transaction of 
the business in hand. A business introduction is delivered 
in person. The envelope containing it should not be sealed, 
and on its left-hand lower corner should be written the 

words, '' Introducing Mr. — ," that its character may 

command immediate attention. No pecuniary obligation is 
incurred by such an introduction, unless particularly men- 
tioned. The conventional form is more or less as follows : 

(^?^^A (l^^^J, QaWy- /(9/^, -/Md.

r 



Introductions should only be given when there is perfect 
confidence felt in the party introduced. It is right to refuse 
such a favor, if thought best, merely on the ground of un- 
willingness to take the liberty of presenting any one to the 
person or firm to whom introduction is asked. 

A social introduction should be given with great caution. 
The writer should be well acquainted with both parties. Be 



POLITE DEPORTMENT. 5g7 

specially careful in making introductions to ladies. It is an 
insult to the whole sex if you present to a lady any person 
of doubtful reputation. Never give letters of introduction, 
unless you are prepared to be responsible for the persons to 
whom they are given. Why should you thrust upon the 
society of a friend those whom you would not admit to your 
own ? Or why ask his good services for individuals whom 
you know do not deserve them ? 

In all such letters candor should prevail. Say what you 
mean. Do not use ambiguous terms which leave a pleasant 
impression on the reader, but awaken a measure of confi- 
dence and generous purpose beyond what you intended. 
Whatever object is proposed in giving the letter should be 
distinctly stated, even though it be that you give it simply 
to rid yourself of a bore. If you know nothing of a party, 
but desire to get him employment, or some such favor, 
state the facts, though you defeat the purpose. 

The holder of a social letter of introduction should not 
take it in person, but should send it with his card of address. 
The receiver, if he be a gentleman, will call, upon you with- 
out delay. At all events, you are bound to give him an 
option ; whereas, by taking your letter in person you force 
yourself upon him, whether he will or not. Should the 
letter introduce a gentleman to a lady, she may, at her op- 
tion, answer by a note of invitation — appointing a time for 
him to call. 

All polite deportment is based upon common sense. It 
is not the prerogative of the privileged and favored few, but 
it is the right and the duty of all. Not one of its require- 
ments is useless if the comfort and welfare of our friends and 
associates be properly considered. The springs of politeness 
must be within. If one has learned to correct personal 
faults, to control self, and to be regardful of others, he has 
gone a long way toward that refinement of nature which 
will make him everywhere a welcome and honored guest. 



56g THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

If in the sanctity of home he lives in obedience to these prin- 
ciples, he will not be likely to ignore them when in the society 
of others ; and when in public places or engaged in corres- 
pondence, it will be as natural for him to be well-mannered 
and self-poised as it is for the thriving plant to drink in the 
morning dew. If it is worth while to have keen enjoyment 
of life — to win and to retain friends, and to make society 
better by our correct life in the midst of it — then it is no loss 
of time, but a gain in every direction, to understand and 
practice all that is included in Polite Deportment.

Care of Children. 



O child! O new-born denizen 

Of life's great city ! on thy head

Like a celestial benizon ! 
Here at the portal thou dost stand, 

And with thy little hand 

Thou openest the mysterious gate 
Into the future's undiscovered land.

Care of Children. 



By W. B. Atkinson, M. D., Lecturer on Diseases of 
Children, Jefferson Medical College, Phila. 



FROM the moment of birth it should be remembered 
that the infant is a being of feeble powers ; that while 
it possesses a wonderful vitality, yet that vitality is 
readily extinguished or impaired. Such impairment often 
remains through life, rendering it a delicate, or perhaps 
deformed^ creature, liable to succumb to the most trivial 
attacks of disease. 

HEREDITARY INFLUENCES. 

Whereas the child born of healthy parents, and that has 
been reared under proper surroundings, is prepared to resist 
the usual diseases of child-life, and if it is attacked, rarely 
fails to have a mild form, from which it recovers perfectly. 
For instance, the child of scrofulous, or otherwise diseased 
parents, when exposed to scarlet fever usually has a bad 
form of the disease and recovers imperfectly, being left with 
running from the ears, or even deafness, or other of the 
common results of this disease. Even where the parentage 
of a child is tainted much may be done to make it better in 
health and less liable to continue the taint in its own person, 
and subsequently to transmit it in time to its offsprirfg. 

571 



572 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

FIRST CARE OF A CHILD. 

At the outset let it be understood that the so-called 
hardening of an infant by exposure, by cold bathing, by a 
prescribed diet, and other such plans is not only a failure, 
but frequently itself is the cause of the beginning of disease 
in an otherwise healthy infant. A new-born child, coming 
as it does from a position in which the temperature has been 
never less than that of the human body internally (98.5 °F.), 
is extremely liable, especially in cold weather, to lose its 
vital heat. Hence, it should not be washed in cold water, 
or, in fact, for the first twenty-four or forty-eight hours, in 
water at all. The best method is to cleanse its surface by 
rubbing the skin with pure, fresh lard or sweet oil. This 
unites readily with the cheesy matter usually found to a 
greater or less extent on the skin of a new-born child ; then, 
with a dry, soft cotton cloth the whole surface is readily 
cleansed. Where blood or other stain still adheres, the 
cloth may be moistened with warm water, and thus the sur- 
face is thoroughly cleansed. The use of water, and particu- 
larly of soap, is objectionable for several reasons. 

Soap— as often found in the sick-room — is made of impure 
fats, which often have a poisonous effect, or it may have an 
excess of alkali, either of which conditions is injurious to 
the delicate cutaneous surface of the child. Again, the 
soapy water usually gets into the child's eyes, resulting in 
more or less inflammation of these delicate organs. Wash- 
ing, unless when performed in a gentle manner, removes 
more or less thoroughly the natural oil of the skin, causing 
chafing, and also giving rise to many forms of eruption so 
often seen in the young infant. At all times the surface 
should be cleansed with care and gentleness. When soap 
becomes absolutely necessary in order to remove dirt, it 
should be of the best quality and used sparingly. The 
temperature of the water should be about that of the blood 
— say 95° — and the child not too long exposed in cool 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 573 

weather, lest its surface be chilled and a congestion of some 
of the internal organs occur. Bathing is always valuable, 
not only for the purposes of cleanliness, but also to keep 
the numerous pores of the skin in a condition to do their 
work. The water should be sufficiently warm to prevent 
the child suffering a chill, and the bath must be given in a 
situation not exposed to a draught, the whole surface to be 
rubbed dry with a soft towel. 

SUITABLE CLOTHING. 

The clothing for the very young child should be loose — 
tied rather than pinned — and in cold v/eather should com- 
pletely cover its body up well around the neck, the arms 
to the wrists, and the legs and feet. Much damage is done 
by the foolish habit of exposing children in cool or cold 
weather — even in the house — with short sleeves, low-necked 
dress, and legs bare above the knees. It must be borne in 
mind that the blood in the extremities is readily chilled, and 
by this means cholera-infantum and dysentery in summer, 
and the colds and other affections of winter, are brought on. 
In hot weather a young child may usually be allowed to lie 
on a blanket or comfortable on the floor, unencumbered 
with much clothing, a light, soft slip being all that is 
required, and the only care being to avoid a draught. Here 
it can roll in every direction and move every muscle without 
'hindrance. 

While upon the subject of the child's clothing we may 
properly urge the importance of keeping the child outside 
the bonds imposed by fashion as long as it is possible. 
Have everything to fit easily and loosely ; give it free scope 
for every movement, that motion may be a pleasure, not a 
pain. Especially see that the foot — usually so perfect and 
handsome at birth — is not confined, cramped in a shoe too 
narrow, and, almost invariably, too short for it. This point 
is one of the greatest value, as children grow so rapidly that 



574 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR K 

frequently we find a shoe but little worn has already become 
too short. Here economy urges many to do a great wrong, 
for the use of a shoe too short for the foot compels nature, 
in its efforts to find room for the lengthening toes, to bend 
them over each other, and thus is produced that hideous 
and laming deformity — a foot with enlarged joints, with 
bunions, and with overlapping toes. Such a foot becomes 
a constant source of misery to its owner who is compelled 
to walk much. Even in hot weather it is safer for a child 
to wear next to its skin a soft merino shirt. The infant 
should wear its flannel band, covering its body from the 
armpits to the groins, until it is able to run about. This 
needs to be applied neatly and carefully, or it becomes a 
mere girdle about the middle of the child. In warm weather 
this band should be made of soft, light flannel, which may 
be made somewhat heavier as the cool weather of fall 
approaches. 

The special value of this band is that it prevents chilling 
of the bowels, almost always the cause of cholera-infantum 
and other bowel affections. As the child becomes older — 
particularly in girls — must we urge the necessity of the 
avoidance of tight bands around the waist by which the 
skirts are supported, dragging constantly on the hips, com- 
pressing the abdomen, and thus forcing the internal organs 
out of their places. The wonderful prevalence of backache, 
sense of weariness after the shortest walk, and a host of ills 
in our female patients, may undoubtedly be traced to this 
as the commencement — aided, subsequently, by immense 
loads of skirts, late hours, neglect of the proper care, and 
the usual habits incident to fashionable life. Nor must we 
forget the support of the stockings. Garters are a constant 
injury, as they are generally worn. They compress the 
entire limb and markedly interfere with the circulation of 
the blood. Many cases of varicose veins are wholly due to 
this habit. 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 575 

SUITABLE FOOD. 

The food of the child from the outset must be either that 
provided by nature, the mother's milk, or something as 
nearly approaching it as may be. The young mother, the 
nurse — all, should be cautioned never to feed the child with 
anything at birth. It should be well understood that this 
is best for several reasons. All such trash as sugar or 
molasses and water, or any of the many abominations usually 
given to the new-born child with the erroneous belief that 
it must be hungry, and hence requires food, tends to cause 
indigestion, and produces wind in the stomach and bowels. 
This induces the child to cry with pain, and it is either fed 
with more of the stuff, under the belief that it is still hungry, 
or, worse, it is dosed with " soothing drops " to relieve its 
pain, and a new source of injury is added. Let me say here 
that no drops, cordials, sirups, or anything in the shape of 
drugs should be given, especially to a young child, without 
the advice of a physician. On this subject we shall speak 
more fully subsequently. 

Let us suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the mother 
has a good flow of milk and the child nurses well. It is 
necessary that she should endeavor to so form its habits 
that it shall at first take the breast about once in every two 
hours, or a little longer, during the day, and about once in 
four to six hours at night. The child is greatly the crea- 
ture of habit, and where the mother begins to put it to the 
breast at every cry, or whenever it rouses, it speedily 
acquires the custom of demanding the breast constantly. 
Indeed, some mothers will lie at night with the infant on the 
arm, so that it virtually sleeps with the nipple in its mouth. 
In such cases the child refuses to submit to any other plan 
and becomes a constant annoyance until it is weaned. As 
it becomes older, the interval between the nursings should 
be lengthened, so that it is suckled once in four to six hours 
and at night generally will go without till the hour for 



576 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

rising has come. The food should be wholly the breast- 
milk or its equivalent until the child has advanced so far 
with its teeth as to be fully able to chew the food thoroughly. 
Nor even then need much change be made ; for long after 
weaning the best food is that into which milk largely enters. 
Too much of a variety is hurtful to a young child. As 
children grow, or should grow, rapidly, and require frequent 
supplies to make up for the wear of, as well as the increase 
in, the body, they should always be supplied with good, 
nourishing food whenever they express a feeling of hunger. 
It is not well to endeavor to restrict such to the exact num- 
ber and hours for meals, as in adult life. 

VALUE OF SUNSHINE. 

Not less important is an abundance of sunlight and fresh 
air. The effects upon plant life of the absence of sunlight 
is shown by the plant growing thin, pale, delicate ; in fact, 
this is made lise of by gardeners to procure tender white 
stalks, as of celery, etc. Abundance of illustrations will 
readily occur to the thoughtful of the vicious effects of a 
want of sunlight. This is one of the most valuable results 
accruing by the transfer of an invalid to the sea-shore, the 
mountains, or to the country farm. We may contrast the 
pale, delicate appearance of those members of an otherwise 
healthy family who are compelled to remain all day long, 
and day after day, in the small house shut in from the sun's 
rays by its overshadowing neighbors, with those whose 
occupation compels them to be abroad. 

Of course, the author would not be understood as advising 
exposure to the direct, fierce rays of the sun in midsum- 
mer. It is its light, rather than its excess of heat, that does 
the good, that increases the vitality of the little one. That 
this does not seem by a great number of people to be re- 
garded as of value is shown by their utter neglect of it, in 
permitting windov/s to be blocked. up by furniture, old hats. 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 577 

clothing, and even dirt. Here cleanliness acts in more ways 
than might at first be anticipated. Therefore, make the 
nursery a light, cheerful room. Use only sufficient curtains 
to prevent the direct rays from being an annoyance. Cur- 
tains should be such as can readily be removed, and so dis- 
posed as to afford the smallest opportunity for the accumu- 
lation of dust; for where such accumulation occurs is' 
most likely to be the nest for a deposit of disease germs. 

GOOD VENTILATION. 

Full and free ventilation must always form a part of the 
means by which we prevent disease, as well as fight it after 
it has entered. Like sunlight, fresh air is a most valuable 
factor in health, and its deprivation equally, one in disease. 
The air of every part of a house should be thoroughly 
changed so soon as the inmates rise in the morning and 
throw open the dwelling. The bed-room windows, save in 
extremely cold or wet weather, should be widely opened, 
and so remain till near nightfall. The living, or work-rooms, 
should equally be cared for. In the sick-room or nursery 
the air can be readily changed from time to time by pro- 
tecting the inmates from the draught. Cover the child, 
head and all, in cold weather, and open the doors and win- 
dows to their fullest extent for a few minutes. Where the 
air does not enter freely and drive out that which is vitiated, 
thorough ventilation may be obtained by swinging the door 
to and fro, shaking the curtains, or some similar plan. For- 
tunately, we find the fresh air from the unlimited reservoir 
without is ready to enter and drive out the disease-laden 
air of the room. At the same time, it must be understood 
that cold air is not always pure air. The fire may be main- 
tained while this is going on, so that the temperature is not 
lowered beyond the degree of comfort. Now that ther- 
mometers of a good quality can be obtained so cheaply, 
every sick-room at least should have one as an indispensa- 



578 THE HOUSEWIFE S LIBRARY. 

ble article of furniture. By its readings, the temperature 
should be carefully observed, so that a moderate and even 
deerree of heat can be secured. 

While we enforce the importance of pure air to children, 
it becomes an imperative duty to allude strongly to the 
vitiation of the air. While in the streets of a large city, 
and even in other localities, circumstances often greatly in- 
terfere with our efforts in this behalf, yet we constantly sfee 
an unnecessary, even criminal, carelessness in such matters. 
The dejections of all kinds are frequently permitted to re- 
main in the rooms during the greater part of the day. 
When possible, especially in cases of contagious diseases, 
these should not only be removed at once, but disinfectants 
should be mixed with them^ thus aiding greatly in prevent- 
ing the spread of disease. A great cause of impure air is 
the constant use of tobacco in the house. To all whose 
sensibility of smell is not blunted by their habits, the stale 
fumes of tobacco adhering to the clothes, the curtains, the 
furniture, are disagreeable. We may be regarded as speak- 
ing strongly on this point, but during an experience, largely 
among children, for over thirty years, we can recall numer- 
ous cases of the use of tobacco by the bedside, and actually 
in the faces, of sick and dying children ; of many instances 
of sudden illness in infants brought on by the inhalation of 
tobacco smoke. A little care and thoughtfulness aids 
greatly in keeping the air of a house pure. Thus, never let 
a poultice, a mustard, or other application remain in the 
room. Air the rooms well after cooking, after meals, after 
the exit of a filthy person. In short, when one enters a 
room from the outer fresh air and detects a strange odor 
there, such a room should be thoroughly ventilated as soon 
as possible.. Warmth, not only by clothing, but by heat, as 
from a fire, is imperatively demanded for children in cold 
and damp weather. The child that expresses a sense of 
chilliness, that shivers, is sick or on the verge of sickness. 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 



579 



TREATMENT OF AILINGS. 

When the child appears in any way to be " out of sorts," 
do not rush at once to drugs. Remember, that in many in- 
stances a calm, refreshing sleep, a few hours of rest, will 
find an apparently very sick child again playing with its 
toys and as happy as though nothing had occurred. All 
are too much in the habit of accepting the gratuitous advice 
of those around them — advice from those who possess not 
the slightest knowledge of medicine. Let it be a fixed rule 
never to give any medicine without the advice of a skilled 
physician. See what can be done by sanitary regulations, 
by removing the causes of disease, by change of locality. 
Constantly are young children made ill by bad air, bad or 
deficient food, and bad drinks. In this connection, for the 
sake of the over-anxious parents who often wildly aban- 
don hope at the slightest sign of disease, and regard the 
child as doomed to die at the outset, we would say that the 
strong power constantly shown in a child by which it throws 
off an attack of disease and recuperates its exhausted 
powers, often seems as though the result of miraculous in- 
tervention. Hence, when sickness appears, no matter how 
terrible its form, however doubtful may appear the result, 
preserve to the end courage and cheerfulness. These aid 
constantly in obtaining the wished-for relief The nursing 
is performed faithfully, the child is not dispirited — in short, 
you thus avoid that injurious condition where, hope being 
banished from the outset, it would seem as though the first 
sign of illness were equivalent to a funeral notice and only 
the forms had to be complied with. A woman who is nurs- 
ing a child should always remember that her milk is ex- 
tremely liable to be rendered injurious to her infant by 
what might seem to her to be but trifling matters. She 
gives way to her temper, her grief; she exhausts herself by 
labor ; she indulges in improper food, and the next act of 



580 THE HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

suckling is sure to be followed by disorder in some way of 
the child's system. 

The author has seen in his own practice several marked 
instances of convulsions in the infant to follow immediately 
after it had begun to draw the milk from the breast of its 
mother who had just been having a scolding match with a 
neighbor. In one instance, the mother had been engaged 
in washing clothing for several hours, during which time the 
infant had not been allowed any nourishment. Finally, 
having completed her task, she sat down, greatly wearied, 
to nurse the child. Almost as soon as the first of the milk 
had entered its stomach, it fell into a profound stupor, from 
which it was with great difficulty aroused. There are 
other points in connection with the matter of nursing of 
equal, perhaps greater, importance, but their consideration 
does not belong to a volume like this. 

BAD HABITS. 

From the earliest hours the mother should esteem it a 
privilege as well as a duty to guard her child by the utmost 
vigilance from the acquiring of bad habits. Any habit in 
the child becomes so rooted — so much a part of its exist- 
ence- — that in after years it is virtually impossible to abolish 
it. We need not specify such habits, for many, if not all, 
are well known to parents, and often much deplored. It 
behooves the parent, however, not to err, and punish a child 
for the symptoms of disease under the belief that it is a bad 
habit. One such matter, in particular, requires our special 
attention. This, while a subject of peculiar delicacy, yet is 
of so great importance that we feel we will readily be ex- 
cused for intruding it in a work of this kind. It is the 
incontinence of urine, especially at night. Constantly do 
we find children punished for this occurrence under the 
belief that it is a carelessness — a bad habit into which they 
have fallen. On the contrary, almost invariably the child 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 53 J 

is a double sufferer, and very unjustly so. It suffers from 
the punishment and suffers from the act, which causes a 
most unpleasant condition until its clothing is changed. 

Again : by many people who recognize that this is really a 
diseased condition it is regarded as incurable, and hence 
nothing is done for its relief When a child is afflicted in 
this way, the parent should at once consult a physician and 
persevere until the child is permanently cured. I say per- 
manently, because in so many of these troubles of childhood 
improvement is temporary and requires persistent treatment. 
When, after such improvement, a relapse occurs, the parents 
are too apt to abandon all effort, with the belief that the 
disease is incurable. We often find that children who are 
troubled with this affliction are in the habit of screaming 
out at night, springing from the bed as if in great fear, or 
burying the head in the clothing, as though to protect them- 
selves from danger. This is an affection known as " Night 
Terrors," and, as in the previous one, the child is constantly 
punished for so doing. Such treatment is not only very 
unjust, but extremely injudicious. When a child presents 
such symptoms it is out of health and imperatively demands 
medical care. An additional reason may be given in the 
fact that such a condition is very apt to be but the forerunner 
or premonitory symptom of loss of mind. Now that we 
know so well that insanity in many of its forms is but the 
expression of a disease which is constantly greatly relieved, 
and often permanently cured, it is well to be warned i;i time, 
and by early treatment prevent the full access of such 
disease. 

HORRIBLE STORIES. 

Scrupulously guard the child against the silly and horri- 
ble stories so frequently told them by nurses and others. 
In all children, especially those of a nervous temperament, 
who are awakened at night, the recollection of these things 
comes to them with terrible force amid the darkness and 



582 ^-^^ ^^^ U^^ WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

the loneliness, and it is enough to drive the child into a 
temporary, if not lasting, insanity. When such an attack 
occurs, always soothe the little one by every endearment, 
keep the light burning, and remain with it until it has been 
composed again to sleep. It is safer in such cases to have 
a light constantly burning, and when possible an attendant 
should be near, that, when aroused, it may at once feel a 
sense of protection. 

To prevent a return of these terrors, the general health 
should be cared for. See that the child has an abundance 
of out-door exercise. Exercise itself is a valuable means 
conducive of sleep in children. The child that has played 
in the open air all day long goes to sleep wearied, but with 
a sense of happiness as it fails into a sound, refreshing slum- 
ber, and, unless disturbed, usually sleeps the entire night 
and wakes refreshed for a new day's work. A special point 
in this connection is that every care should be observed not 
to disturb the sleep of a child. Much harm is constantly 
being done by carelessness in this respect. Another cause of 
harm is overwork of the brain, on which point we will 
speak hereafter. In addition, a child may suffer from such 
attacks as the result of indigestion, or of being indulged in 
too much food just before retiring. In all such cases it 
behooves the parent to remove all causes which may be 
supposed to incite to an attack, and should they continue, 
at once to consult a careful physician. 

SOOTHING SIRUPS. 

In a previous paragraph we alluded to " soothing sirups " 
and articles of a like nature, of which the name is legion. 
All such are useless and dangerous. It is safest and best 
to give no medicine to a child without the advice of a phy- 
sician. When, however, it would appear necessary to resort 
to such means, no article should be used of which the com- 
ponent parts are not fully known. Despite the assurances 



CARE OF children: ' 583 

so freely given that this or that remedy contains nothing 
that is hurtful, we are constantly being deceived. The 
most hurtful and powerful drugs are usually the basis of all 
these nostrums, and which educated physicians would hesi- 
tate to employ for infants, except under great necessity and 
with the utmost precaution. The effect is generally to lull 
the symptoms for the time, while the cause is insidiously 
undermining the child's health,' and finally the little one 
gets beyond the reach, of the aid which, too late, is sum- 
moned to it. Again, the child speedily becomes accustomed 
to such articles, and requires their continuance and in in- 
creased doses. The least evil result is indigestion, followed 
by constipation, stunted growth, enfeebled intellect, and 
generally producing such a condition of impairment of 
vitality that the child readily yields to the most ordinary 
attack of disease, and death ends the lesson. 

TEETHING. 
The period for the appearance of the second or perma- 
nent set of teeth is rarely one when there need be any fear of 
disease. But it is very important that the parents should 
observe carefully that these teeth are cut regularly and are 
not interfered with by the temporary ones. Should they 
show signs of irregularity or of a tendency to decay, do not 
delay, but" at once consult a skilled physician or dentist, 
that the trouble may be known and obviated. 

EARLY SCHOOLING. 

The question of the education of a child should always be 
one demanding careful consideration. While we are met 
on every hand by infant prodigies — children of wonderful 
precocity — yet it should be borne in mind that this is not 
according to the dictates of nature or of common sense. 
The hours of infancy and early childhood should be devoted 
to the accumulation of a fund of health, which in due time 



584 ^-^^ HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAR K 

will enable its possessor to master, not only attacks of 
disease, but at the proper time to master the most difficult 
problems. These hours should be the happiest of life — free 
from cares or tasks, and particularly free from that irksome 
confinement to the hard benches of a school-room. " Seven 
years a baby." This is always true, and never more so than 
in regard to education. It is time enough after a child has 
reached and passed that era for it to commence the serious 
business of attending school. We would urge that, except 
in the most easy and pleasant manner possible, no positive 
efforts should be made in the line of what is known as edu- 
cation. 

Certainly, a healthy child is always learning, and little 
by little, with proper care, with scarcely an effort it 
acquires a valuable fund of knowledge during these early 
years. But there should be as few set tasks as possible, no 
memorizing of dates, or of long strings of verses or questions. 
Rather, in these days, the beautiful, the happy method of 
the Kindergarten. Especially during the bright, warm 
days of summer should all confinement to the house be 
avoided. The school must be in the open air, wherever 
it can best be obtained, learning from nature's ever-open 
book. In this connection the evil results of overwork of 
the brain must constantly be borne in mind. Thus are 
often planted the seeds of disease, which too soon yield an 
abundant crop and a harvest of consumption, insanity, and 
the like. Chorea, or St. Vitus' dance, as it is commonly 
called, is frequently brought on by overwork of the brain, 
and even cases are known where an intellect exceptionally 
brilliant at the outset has in a few years been clouded by 
idiocy. 

A common belief with many is that all our meals should 
be partaken of in silence, and though not hastily, yet with- 
out undue loitering over them. This is a grave error. The 
table hour at all times should be a social one. Parents and 



CARE OF CHILDREN. 585 

children should, when convenient, enjoy their meals together 
and enlivened with pleasant chat. This prevents the bolt- 
ing of food half chewed, and other bad habits, and while the 
younger ones should not be permitted to monopolize, or 
even largely share in, the conversation, yet they should be 
encouraged to habits of attention and respect on these occa- 
sions that will enable them to profit in the future. 

PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT. 

As a child increases in years it should increase in 
strength. Here we gain by open-air exercise. In the very 
young their very exuberance of spirits prompts, even com- 
pels, them to romp and frolic. They are like young animals 
of all kinds, which we see wildly rushing back and forth in 
the fields, as if utterly unable to keep still. But as a child 
gets older it is too apt (especially is this seen in young 
girls) to be content with quiet play. Here comes in the 
value of light gymnastics. When not carried so far as to 
become a task, it proves extremely useful by bringing into 
play m succession each and every set of muscles. By the 
majority of teachers this exercise is so conducted as to be 
regarded as a pleasant means of health exercise, and only 
so long is it useful. The child that finds light exercise a 
drag requires close attention lest disease be making inroads 
when least expected. Hence a teacher should be watchful 
not to disregard the evident signs which tell of exhaustion, 
and should act accordingly. 

Dancing becomes a means to the same end, but, unfortu- 
nately, it is sadly abused. This is not the place to descant at 
length upon the abuses of dancing, save to warn parents not 
to permit this exercise to be carried so far that it produces 
muscular exhaustion rather than tenacity of the muscles. 
Skating, whether on the ice or on parlor skates, is equally a 
valuable exercise, but always with the same proviso. Re- 
cently we find the addition of lawn tennis, croquet, cricket, 



586 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

and base ball as incentives to out-door exercise. With all 
of them the constant trouble is to prevent excesses. The 
great desire for victory carries the players forward until 
they have long passed the boundary of benefit and they 
reap an abundant harvest of joints and muscles strained, not 
to say those graver injuries — heart diseases, blood vessels 
ruptured, hernia, and the like. The last game — viz., base 
ball, should be abolished from the list permitted for children. 
It not only demands too much and prolonged exertion, 
very destructive to the growing frame, but its dangers of 
maiming, even killing, its players are so many that it is 
absolutely unsafe both for performers and spectators. 

HOME GOVERNMENT. 

The home of a child from its earliest remembrance 
should be associated with happiness. Health is always the 
handmaid of happiness. A peevish, fretful child not only 
discomforts those around it, but is itself constantly the vic- 
tim of indigestion and the like. Hence it becomes an im- 
portant duty for the parent to begin the moral education of 
a child almost at birth. We constantly see how rapidly 
even an infant becomes the tyrant of the household when 
its slightest whims and humors are permitted and indulged. 
Kindness, but also firmness, are demanded in the treatment 
of children. Decide what is right, what is best, and let 
that decision be final. Make such decisions in no petulant, 
hasty spirit. This only leads to fear rather than love, and 
perhaps to concealment and deception. 

Above all, as the child grows older and more observant, 
be extremely watchful lest your example lead it astray. 
Remember, a child is ever apt to imitate the actions of those 
with whom it is constantly associated. Regard these little 
ones as your most priceless treasures. Study that you 
may so fashion their homes and their lives that the future 
will reflect no doubtful or evil results. 



SEVENTH DEPARTMENT. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES, 



We know not of what we are capable till the trial comes ; — till it comes, 
perhaps, in a form which makes the strong man quail, and turns the gentler 
woman into a heroine. Mrs. Jameson. 



Trying Emergencies. 



WHAT TO DO FIRST. 

EMERGENCIES will arise. Accidents will occur ; and 
when they occur the prompt action, if it be wisely- 
directed, is that which accomplishes the needed work. 
An alphabetical arrangement of such cases as are most 
common is here given. When an emergency does arise, 
deliberately look for directions in this chapter, and proceed 
as directed, meanwhile seeking a physician. 

Apoplexy. — In apoplexy the patient suddenly falls into a 
state of stupor or unconsciousness, the pupils of the eyes 
are dilated, the breathing laborious or snoring, the swallow- 
mg difficult, the pulse slow and sometimes irregular, with 
loss of power in the limbs, and usually a deeply flushed 
face. Do not mistake this for intoxication. In such a case 
elevate the head and body, loosen the clothing about the 
neck, place the feet in hot mustard water with mustard over 
the stomach, apply cold to the head and nape of the neck, 
and send at once for a physician. If a doctor cannot be 
obtained quickly, open the bowels by an injection of soap 
and warm water. 

Astluna. — Asthmatic attacks may frequently be cut short 
in several ways. If the patient be very nervous, let the 
attention be diverted in any way possible and the breathing 
will soon become much easier. Another method of relief 
may be found in administering an emetic ; still another, in 
smokmg the asthma cigarettes which are sold generally by 

689 



690 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

the druggists ; still another, in drinking one or more cups 
of strong coffee; still another, in inhaling steam from a 
basin of hot water into which a tablespoonful of Hoffman's 
anodyne has been poured, and still another, by giving a full 
dose of opium, laudanum, or paregoric. 

Bites of Dogs, Serpents, etc. — Make haste to suck well the 
bites of dogs, cats, snakes, and other animals whose bites 
are poisonous, unless the mouth is sore. In the case of 
dogs also bind the limb tightly above the bite and burn the 
wound with a hot iron or needle ; besides, capture the dog, if 
possible, and keep him watched carefully until ascertained 
whether he is mad or not. In the case of snake bite, after 
sucking and burning the wound, give whisky or brandy 
in full doses and keep up the intoxication until the doctor is 
called. 

Bleeding, see Hemorrhages. 

Blisters. — All blisters, whether caused by burns, scalds, 
heat of the sun, Spanish fly, or friction, should be carefully 
opened near one edge without removing the skin, and then 
dressed with sweet oil or some mild ointment like simple 
cerate, cold cream, or cosmoline. 

Broken Bones, see Fractures. 

Bruises. — First cleanse them ; then, until pain is relieved, 
apply cloths wet with cold water, to which laudanum may 
be added. After the pain has subsided, warm water dress- 
ings will hasten the removal of the discoloration, swelling, 
and soreness. 

Black Eye. — This should be treated as any other bruise. 
After the swelling is gone, the dark color may be concealed 
by painting it or by flesh-colored plaster. 

Bums and Scalds. — Dust the parts with bicarbonate of soda, 
or wet with water in which as much of the soda has been 
placed as can be dissolved. When the burns are so severe 



. TRYING EMERGENCIES. 59 1 

that the skin broken and blisters are raised, open the blis- 
ters at one side and swathe the parts with soft linen anointed 
with simple cerate or saturated with sweet oil, castor oil, or 
equal parts of linseed oil and limewater. Burns from acids 
should be well washed with water. Burns from caustic 
alkalies, should be well washed with vinegar and water. 
When a person's clothing is on fire he should quickly lie 
down and be wrapped in carpet or something else that will 
smother the flame. 

Choking. — If possible, remove the offending substance at 
once with the fingers, or with blunt scissors used as forceps, 
or a loop of small wire bent like a hairpin. It may be pos- 
sible to dislodge it by blowing strongly in the ear, or by 
causing the patient to vomit by tickling the throat. In a 
child these efforts may be aided by holding it up by the 
legs. If pins, needles, or fish bones get in the throat, they 
frequently require great care in attempts at removal. A 
surgeon had better be called as soon as possible if the body 
cannot be dislodged at once, and especially if there be dif- 
ficulty in breathing. 

Cholera Morbus. — This affection often requires that some- 
thing be done at once. For this purpose, thirty drops of 
laudanum or two or three teaspoonfuls of paregoric may be 
given to an adult, or proportionate doses for children. Also 
apply over the stomach a mustard plaster or cloths wrung 
out of hot water and turpentine, and frequently changed. 
If relief is not soon obtained, seek the advice of a physician. 

CoUc. — May be treated as above, with the addition of an 
emetic or purgative, or both, if due to undigested food. 

Convulsions in Children. — When these occur, place the child 
at once in a bath of hot water with mustard added ; apply 
cold water cloths to the head, move the bowels with an in- 
jection of warm water or soapsuds, and give enough sirup 
of ipecac to vomit, unless this has already occurred. Con- 



692 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

vulsions frequently indicate the commencement of some disv 
ease ; hence it is well to call a physician early. 

Contusions, see Bruises. 

Croup. — When a child is taken suddenly with the croup 
at night, give at once a teaspoonful of sirup of ipecac, or 
the same with a few drops of antimonial wine added, or a 
teaspoonful of powdered alum followed by a cup of water. 
Repeat these soon if necessary to cause vomiting. Warm 
water cloths may be applied to the throat if covered with 
dry wrappings. Keep the child warm, so that sweating may 
be induced, and strive to allay its excitement or fear. 

Cuts, see Wounds. 

DiarrliOBa. — Diarrhoea is most generally caused by an irri- 
tation of the bowels, due either to the presence of undigested 
food or the remains of a previous constipation. Hence it 
is always well to commence treatment by a dose of castor 
oil, to which may be added ten drops of laudanum. After 
the bowels have been moved, give to an adult ten or fifteen 
drops of laudanum after each subsequent movement, stop- 
ping its use after a few doses. Half-teaspoonful doses of 
ginger in water may be tried. Injections of boiled starch 
with twenty or thirty drops of laudanum may be tried. Give 
but little opium to children. 

Dysentery. — Dysentery may almost certainly be recog- 
nized by the griping and bearing-down feeling when the 
bowels are moved, and especially if the discharges are slimy 
and mixed with blood. 

A physician should be consulted without wasting much 
time in trying the simpler diarrhoea remedies. 

Dislocations. — A dislocation is the displacement of the end 
of a bone at the joint; hence there is a deformity of the 
joint. The ligaments about the joints are necessarily more 
or less torn ; hence there is pain. Most of these dislocations 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 593 

will require the skill of a surgeon ; hence one should be ob- 
tained as early as possible, care being taken to make the 
patient as comfortable as may be by an easy position and 
cooling and soothing applications to the affected joint. 

The following named joints may be easily restored usually 
by the process given : Dislocations of the fingers are reduced 
by pulling in the line of the bones with moderate pressure 
at the affected joint. Retain in place by a small splint loosely 
bound along the back of the finger and hand. 

Dislocation of lower jaw. — Replace this by wrapping the 
two thumbs well with towels, then thrusting them into the 
two sides of the patient's mouth, slipping them over the back 
teeth, at the same time grasping firmly, with the fingers, the 
two sides of the jaws outside the mouth, and making pres- 
sure firmly downward and backward with the thumbs, using 
the sides of the jaw as a lever. As soon as the jaw is felt 
to be moving into place, slip the thumbs quickly from off 
the teeth into the sides of the cheeks to prevent having them 
crushed by the teeth, which will be drawn together with 
great force. Afterward, keep the jaw in place by bandag- 
ing, so that the lower teeth will be firmly pressed against 
the upper row. 

Dislocation of shoulder. — To reduce this, place the patient 
on his back, sit down close by his side with foot to his 
shoulder, remove the shoe and place the foot in his arm-pit, 
seize the patient's hand and pull firmly, drawing the arm 
somewhat across the body, and making at the same time, 
pressure upward and outward with the foot in the arm-pit. 
If successful, the head of the bone will be heard, or felt, to 
go in place with a snap. If not soon successful, stop and 
send for a surgeon. Retain bone in place by bringing the 
forearm across the chest and securing there by some kind of 
bandage. 

Drowning. — To prevent drowning. — When upset in a boat 



594 ^^^^ ^^O ^^^^ WIFE'S LIBRAE V. 

or thrown into the water and unable to swim, draw the 
breath in well ; keep the mouth tight shut ; do not struggle 
and throw the arms up, but yield quietly to the water ; hold 
the head well up, and stretch out the hands only de/ow the 
water ; to throw the hands or feet z/J> will pitch the body 
de/ow the water, hands or feet 2// will pitch the body head 
down, and cause the whole person to go immediately under 
water. Keep the head above ^ and everything else under 
water. 

To restore the apparently drowned, — ^As soon as removed 
from the water, treat the patient instantly on the spot with- 
out wasting precious time in removing to a house, unless 
the weather is intensely cold. Free the neck, chest, and 
waist of clothing. Place the patient on his face with a 
cushion under his chest and his arm under his forehead, and 
make pressure on the back for a moment to force water from 
the lungs. Clear the mouth with the finger and prevent the 
tongue from obstructing the windpipe by bringing it well for- 
ward, and securing it there by passing a cord well back over 
its base, bringing the ends out at the corners of the mouth 
and tying them under the chin. Then turn the patient on 
the back, with a cushion under the shoulders so as to carry 
the chin away from the chest and thus extend the neck. 
Then seek to restore respiration in the following manner, 
which is generally known as Sylvester's method : place your- 
self behind the patient's head, seize the arms near the elbows 
and sweep them around away from the body and bring them 
together above the head, at the same time giving them a 
strong pull for a few seconds. This elevates the ribs, en- 
larges the chest, and thus fills the lungs with air. Next 
return the arms to their former position beside the chest 
and make strong pressure against the lower ribs for a 
moment so as to drive out the air again from the lungs. 
Repeat this manoeuvre about fifteen or sixteen times a 
minute, and keep it up for a long time, unless natural 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 595 

respiration is secured in the meantime, or it has been estab- 
lished beyond a doubt that the patient is certainly dead. 

When the patient begins to breathe, stimulate this by the 
use of ammonia applied to the nose, by slapping briskly the 
surface of the body, by dashing water upon the chest or face, 
and by suiting the artificial to the movement of the natural 
as nearly as possible. Let some person also commence rub- 
bing the limbs briskly upward so as to aid the feeble circu- 
lation ; and secure warmth to the body by warm blankets, 
warm bricks, bottles of warm water (or anything else that 
will retain heat), applied to the armpits, over the stomach, 
and elsewhere about the body. Let some stimulant be 
given as soon as it can be swallowed, and repeated occa- 
sionally until danger is over. 

Never attempt to move the patient until fully restored if 
you can possibly avoid it. Then he should be carefully 
placed in a warm bed and watched to see that breathing 
does not suddenly cease. Should this occur, renew the ar- 
tificial respiration at once. 

Ear (Foreign bodies in). — If a living insect is in the ear, 
turn the head to the opposite side and fill the ear with tepid 
water, oil, or glycerine, and it will soon come to the surface. 

A bright light thrown into the ear will also often suc- 
ceed in bringing it out. Anybody that will not swell when 
moistened with water may probably be removed by syring- 
ing the ear thoroughly, with the face held downward. 

None but the very gentlest probing of the ear should be 
attempted by any one but a physician, who understands 
what a delicate organ he has to deal with. 

Earache. — Earaches frequently are caused by diseased 
teeth. In such cases the quickest remedy is either the 
extraction of the sinning tooth or the adoption of treatment 
appropriate for the toothache. Earaches not caused by the 
teeth may often be relieved by using hot drinks, and a hot 



596 THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

hop poultice over the affected ear. A persistent earache 
most likely indicates some disease of the ear and should 
always lead to consulting a doctor. 

Epileptic Fits. — These are known by pallor of face at first, 
a peculiar cry, loss of consciousness, then flushing of face 
and violent convulsions, with foaming at the mouth, rolling 
of the eyes, and biting of the lips and tongue. 

In a fit of this kind, place the patient on the back, with 
little or no elevation of the head ; control his movements only 
so far as to prevent injury; place a folded towel between the 
teeth, if possible, to prevent the biting of the tongue. 

When the convulsion is over, let the patient rest in some 
quiet place, having previously taken a slight stimulant if very 
much exhausted by the violence or length of the fit. 

Eye {Foreign bodies in), — Dirt in the eye may be washed 
out by squeezing from a sponge a small stream of tepid 
water. To wash lime from the eye, use the tepid water mod- 
erately acidulated with vinegar or lemon-juice. Cinders 
and other small particles may be removed generally by 
touching them with a soft silk or linen handkerchief twisted 
to a point, or by using a loop of human hair. Metallic par- 
ticles can often be removed best by the use of a magnet. 

To expose the eye more fully, the upper lid may be easily 
everted by lifting it by the lashes and pressing from above 
by a slender pencil or stick. 

Painting. — When persons have fainted lay them down 
with the head as low as possible, loosen the clothing, keep 
back any crowding that would interfere with plenty of fresh 
air ; sprinkle water over the face, apply hartshorn to the 
nose, and if too long in recovering consciousness, place 
heated cloths or plates over the stomach. 

Fits in Children, see Convulsions. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES, 597 

Fish-hooks. — When a fish-hook has entered any part of the 
body, cut off the line, file off the flattened end, and pass 
the hook on through the flesh like you would a needle in 
sewing. 

Fractures. — Broken bones are easily recognized by the 
grating of the ends on each other, by the unusual bending 
of the limb, and by the pain caused by motion at this point. 
A fracture is called compound when the end of the bone 
protrudes through the skin. Whenever such protrusion is 
seen, the part should be cleansed and at once covered with 
adhesive plaster or a piece of linen saturated with white 
of ^%'g. All fractures should be attended to by a surgeon ; 
consequently the dressings suggested here are only tem- 
porary, and intended to protect the parts from further 
injury. 

In fracture of the arm above the elbow, bandage the 
upper arm to the side of the chest, and place the hand in a 
sling. 

In fracture of the arm below the elbow, bend the arm at 
the elbow at a right angle, place the thumb uppermost, and 
bandage it between two padded splints, reaching from elbow 
to ends of the fingers, one being placed on the back of 
/ the arm and the other on the front, and place the hand in a 
sling. 

In fracture of the leg below the k7iee, extend the leg beside 
the sound one, giving it the same position ; place a pillow 
beneath from the knee down, fold the sides of the pillow 
over the leg, and secure it in that position by bandages. 

In fracture of the thigh-bone, place the patient on the back 
in bed, relax the muscles of the leg by drawing the feet up 
toward the body sufficiently, bind splints to the outer and 
inner side of the broken thigh ; then bind both legs together, 
and turn patient on the side with the injured limb upper- 
most. 



598 ^-^^ ^^ ^^^^ WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

In fracture of the knee-cap^ bind the whole limb to a 
sphnt on the back of it, being careful to place a sufficiently 
large pad beneath the bend of the knee. 

In fracture of the collar-bone, place the patient on his back 
on a hard bed without any pillow. 

hi fracture of the lower jaw, close the mouth and bandage 
so as to keep the two rows of teeth together. 

In fractures of the skull, lay the patient down and apply 
cold, wet cloths to the head. 

In other fractures, place the patient in the most comforta- 
ble position possible, keep him quiet, and apply cold water 
to prevent swelling. 

For splints, pasteboard, leather, shiogles, or pieces of 
cigar-box may be used. 

Frostbite. — In frostbite use gentle friction in a warm room, 
using enough cold water or snow to prevent too rapid 
reaction and consequent pain in the affected part. If very 
severe, call a physician, as gangrene may follow. 

Gunsliot Wounds, see Wounds. 
Heatstroke, see Sunstroke. 

Hemorrliages. — In hemorrhages from an artery, the blood 
is bright red, and spurts or jets out from a cut. To stop it, 
make compression between the wound and the heart. 

In venous hemorrhage the blood is dark in color and 
flows in a steady stream. To stop it, nlake compression on 
the side of the wound away from the heart. Hemorrhage 
from the lungs is bright red and frothy^ while that from the 
stomach is of dark Color. 

To make thorough compression of a blood-vessel, knot a 
large handkerchief in the middle, piace the knot over the 
line of the vessel, tie the ends firmJy around the limb, thrust 
a short stick beneath, and twist by turning the stick like 
you turn an auger. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. ^^^ 

Hemorrhage from the nose may be ^stopped generally by 
snuffing up the nose salt and water, alum and water, or vin- 
egar, or by applying ice between the shoulders or at the 
back of the neck. Keep head raised. 

In hemorrhage from the lungs, place the patient in a sit- 
ting posture in bed, giving teaspoonful doses of salt and 
vinegar every fifteen minutes, and apply ice or cold water to 
the chest, unless the patient is too weak to bear it. ^^ 

In hemorrhage from the stomach, broken ice may be swal- 
lowed with teaspoonful doses of vinegar. 

In hemorrhage from the bowels, use ice-water injections 
and ice over the abdomen. 

Lyiiries to the Brain. — Blows or falls upon the head are lia- 
ble to injure the brain in two ways. 

Concussion of the brain is recognized by the sickness, faint- 
ness, pallor, depression, and confusion of the patient, and is 
best treated by placing the patient on his back in a quiet, cool 
place, loosening the clothing, and applying heat to the body 
and limbs if they be clammy or cold. 

Compression of the brain is due to fracture of the skull, 
generally a portion being depressed. The symptoms and 
treatment about the same as apoplexy. 

Xntoxication. — This may be distinguished from apoplexy by 
the absence of paralysis and of insensibilty of the eye-ball, 
and by the smell of liquor on the breath. 

When sure that the patient is intoxicated and not suffer- 
ing from apoplexy, an emetic may be given, followed by a 
dose of some preparation of ammonia. 

Vinegar is a very good thing to sober a drunken person. 

Insect Stings, see Stings. 

Ivy Poisoning. — ^Treated by fhe application of cloths satu- 
rated with sugar-of-lead water or with a solution of bicar- 
bonate of soda in water. 



600 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Lightning Stroke. — Treat with rest and stimulants and 
warmth appHed to the body. 

Nausea and Vomiting. — First cleanse the stomach by giving 
large draughts of warm water, and then give small pieces of 
ice, a teaspoonful of lime-water, or a half teaspoonful of aro- 
matic spirits of ammonia, or a small quantity of magnesia 
or baking-soda, and, if necessary, place a mustard plaster 
over the pit of the stomach. 

Nervous Attacks, or Shivering Fits, are treated by hot 
drinks, heat to the surface of the body, mustard or turpen- 
tine over the stomach, and a dose of Hoffman's anodyne or 
tincture of valerian, if at hand. 

Nose (Foreign bodies in). — Children are apt to shove up 
their noses small bodies of different sorts, which may cause 
serious trouble unless soon removed. Their removal may 
often be effected by vigorously blowing the nose or by re- 
peated sneezing, produced by snuff, or by tickling the nose 
with a feather. If these fail, a hair-pin or button-hook may 
be carefully tried. 

Nose-bleed^ see Hemorrhages. 

Poisons. — Acids act as irritant poisons, of which the most 
common are sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, and oxalic. 

For poisoning by any of these, give large quantities of 
either soda, magnesia, chalk, whitewash, whiting, or plaster. 
Then provoke vomiting, give bland drinks, rest, and stimu- 
lants if required. For oxalic acid the best antidote is lime 
in some form. For carbolic acid, vomiting, large draughts 
of oil or milk, rest, warmth of body, and stimulants. 

For the alkaline poisons — ammonia, soda, potash, or con- 
centrated lye — give vinegar freely ; then provoke vomiting, 
and give bland drinks, followed by rest, and stimulants if 
required. 

For arsenic, Paris green, or Scheele's green, give large quan- 
tities of milk, white of ^^%, or flour and water ; then vomit ; 



TRYmc EMERGENCIES. gQl 

then give tablespoonful doses of dialyzed iron, followed by 
a teaspoonful of salt in a cup of water ; vomit again ; give a 
dose of castor-oil, with rest, and stimulants if needed. 

Sugar of lead. — Give Epsom salts, provoke vomiting ; re- 
peat several times ; then give demulcent drinks, followed by 
castor-oil. 

Y ox corrosive sublimate, provoke vomiting, give strong tea 
without milk; repeat these several times, then give milk and 
raw eggs ; follow with a dose of castor-oil, and stimulate if 
necessary. 

For tartar ejnetic, use the same treatment as for corrosive 
sublimate. 

¥ or phosphorus (usually from matches), provoke vomiting 
by giving repeatedly five-grain doses of sulphate of copper, 
then give a dose of magnesia, but ?io oil. 

For lunar caustic, give a strong solution of salt and water 
repeatedly, then vomit. 

For iodine, vomit, give starch dissolved in water freely, 
following with bland drinks. 

For opiuin, laudanum, morphia, paregoric, and chloral, 
vomit the patient freely and repeatedly, with mustard and 
warm water; then give strong coffee; keep the patient 
roused by brisk slapping of the skin, or by moving about, 
or by the galvanic battery, and use Sylvester's method* of 
keeping up artificial respiration if necessary. 

For strychnine, vomit once or twice, give a purgative, and 
then secure absolute rest in a dark, cool room, free from 
draughts. Large doses of bromide of potash (thirty grains) 
or twenty grains of chloral may be given. 

For toadstools or Jamestown [jimsoii) weed, produce 
vomiting and follow by stimulants and external application 
of heat. 

For decayed meats and vegetables, empty the stomach, 
then give a dose of castor-oil and some powdered charcoal.

QQ2 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

For all poisons the best general emetic is mustard and 
plenty of warm water, aided, if possible, by the patient's 
finger thrust down the throat. The best stimulant is strong, 
hot tea or coffee, to which may be added the alcoholic 
stimulants. The best bland drinks are milk, beaten raw 
eggs, gum arable water, or oil. Demulcent drinks are of 
the same general character. They are mucilaginous, and 
so protect the coatings of the stomach from irritants, etc. 

Scalds, see Burns. 

Shocks. — In violent shock, such as results from severe 
injuries, lay the patient down, cover warmly, and if cold, 
apply external heat by using bottles of hot water, hot 
bricks, or hot flannels, etc. If the patient can swallow, 
give stimulants ; if not, give stimulating injections. A mus- 
tard-plaster may be applied to the chest and spine with 
advantage. 

Snake-bites, see Bites. 

Spasms, see Convulsions. 

Spitting Blood, see Hemorrhages. 

Splinters. — Wood splinters, if not too brittle, may generally 
be extracted by tweezers or forceps by seizing the end and 
pulling steadily and carefully in the direction opposite that 
in which they entered. Nature will soon make them easier 
of extraction by the formation of matter around them. To 
get hold of a splinter under the nail, cut out a V-shaped 
portion of the nail above it and then the end can be seized. 
Splinters of glass unless readily extracted should be left to 
the skill of the surgeon. When a splinter in the eye can- 
not be extracted, bathe in cold water and bandage loosely, 
so as to keep the eye as quiet as possible till the surgeon 
arrives. 

Sprains. — Treat sprains by rest, elevation of the limb, cold, 
moist applications at first, and afterward either cold or warm, 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. gQg 

whichever gives the greater degree of comfort. A splint or 
bandage is sometimes useful. 

Stings. — The stings of scorpions, tarantulas, centipedes, 
bees, wasps, hornets, etc., may be treated best by the appli- 
cation of cloths wet in cold water, or wet mud even. The 
application of a little ammonia or salt and water will gen- 
erally give marked relief. 

Suffocation. — Treat by quick removal to the open air, 
loosen the garments, and apply friction and artificial respira- 
tion if necessary. To escape injury by the heavier gases, as 
carbonic acid gas, the gases of mines, wells, etc., strive to 
keep the head above them. To escape through smoke, 
cover the head with some article of clothing, and seek the 
outlet with the head as near the floor as possible. 

Sunburn. — For sunburn, use equal parts of bicarbonate of 
soda and fresh lard or cosmoline. 

Sunstroke. — Treat this by removing the clothing, applying 
ice to the head and arm-pits until the high temperature is 
lowered and consciousness returns, when it should be dis- 
continued until a rising temperature again calls for it. A 
cold bath of iced water may be very beneficial. 

Toothache. — When due to a hollow tooth, cleanse the 
cavity with a little dry cotton on a probe or large needle, 
and then pack into the cavity a wad of cotton which has 
been dipped in creosote, oil of cloves, or ether. When there 
is no cavity, try bathing the face and gums with some of the 
various anodynes. 

Unconsciousness. — For the recognition of unconsciousness 
due to fainting, injuries of the brain, and intoxication, see 
those subjects. When unconscious'ness is due to disease of 
kidneys there will generally be convulsions, also a smell of 
urine and a dropsical swelling about the eyes and legs. 
When there is uncertainty as to the cause of the uncon- 



604 ^-^^ ^O USE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

sciousness, lay the patient on his back with the head some- 
what raised; and if there be pallor and other signs of 
prostration and a cold surface, apply ammonia to the nose, 
with heat externally and hot drinks internally. If there 
be a hot surface, cold should be used externally and in- 
ternally. 

Wounds. — The first important thing to do is to stop the 
hemorrhage according to the directions given under the 
head of Hemorrhages. Press tightly between the wound 
and heart if the blood is bright red and spurts or jets out; 
but if blood is dark and flows slowly and steadily, make 
pressure beyond the wound or on both sides of it. For 
wounds high up in the arm, press firmly just above and back 
of the middle of the collar-bone ; and for those high up in 
the leg, press over where the artery is found beating in the 
groin. For wounds of the head, apply pad over the wound 
and bandage tightly. 

To temporarily dress incised wounds or clean cuts, bring 
the edges of the cut evenly together and fasten by bandages, 
adhesive plaster, or pieces of linen saturated in white of o.^^. 
When the chest or abdomen is cut so that the lung or bow- 
els protrude, first cleanse these by gently squeezing over them 
tepid water from a sponge, and then carefully place them 
back very gently with a soft cloth wet in warm water ; if not 
able to replace them with such a cloth, wet with warm water 
and keep it wet until a surgeon arrives. 

Lacerated or torn wounds seldom bleed much. These 
should be carefully cleansed of all foreign substances, the 
parts placed in position as nearly as possible, and then 
treat as bruises with wet cloths sprinkled with laudanum. 

Perforated Wounds, such as may be made with a rusty 
nail, should be enlarged or kept open by the introduction of 
lint, which must be changed three or four times a day, and 
the wound should be kept well cleansed. 



TRYING EMERGENCIES. 605 

Gunshot Wounds should always have the care of a sur- 
geon. Temporarily let them be treated by cold, wet cloths, 
with the addition of laudanum if required. If there be signs 
of shock, treat according to directions given under that head. 
About the same general directions may be followed in the 
treatment of injuries caused by machinery. It may be ac- 
cepted as a rule, that gunshot wounds, railroad accidents, 
and machinery accidents are worse than they seem to be. 
The shock to the system is also very severe in these cases, 
and is hard to rally from. 

In all emergencies, the poorest thing to do is to lose 
presence of mind and to hesitate when action is needed. 
Be cool, prompt, decided! 

EMERGENCY BY FIRE. 

Beyond the class of emergencies already discussed, that 
by fire is as imperative as any. There may be dangers of this 
kind where the most pressing duty is flight. One should 
prepare himself for this by cool contemplation of every new 
situation in which he sleeps or tarries — where the probable 
source of danger lies and what is the most available method 
of escape should be in mind before the emergency arises. 

As a rule, however, the party who discovers a fire should 
give an alarm and then run at it — not from it. Many fires 
can be smothered out. Far less water will drown a fire 
than many suppose. A bucket of water applied from a tin 
dipper to the point of greatest peril will do more good than 
a barrel of water promiscuously dashed out. Keep cool 
and put water where it is needed. 

In a smoke-filled apartment lie down and creep on the 
floor. Tie a wet handkerchief over the mouth and nostrils 
when passing dense smoke. Carry a coil of small but 
strong rope, with knots along it, when you travel. If need- 
ing to escape by it, fasten one end to the bedstead, grasp 



QQQ THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

the rope with a towel, and slide down slowly. Do what 
you can for others who may share your peril, keeping your 
presence of mind and assuring others. 

RAILROAD ACCIDENTS. 

These are generally so sudden that no amount of pre- 
caution avails. As a rule for passengers, however, it is best 
never to jump from a train. That involves more danger 
than staying aboard, usually. The aisle of the car and near 
its centre are the safest positions, as a rule. It is bad in col- 
lisions to have the feet entangled with the seats. To mount 
the seat or reach the aisle is generally safer. In any case, 
keep your presence of mind, without shouting or rashness. 
None but a foolhardy person allows his head or arms to 
project from a moving train.

Games AND Amusements. 




There are some trades that are solitary and exclusive. Authorship is one 
of these ; and perhaps the author is not always a very amusing inmate. But 
the actor in the private play, the clever and ready wit who makes the charade 
lively, the musician, the embroideress, the fortune-teller, . . . and the artistic 
member — these can add to home amusements.

RECREATION is re — creation. It makes a man feel 
new. Time immemorial it has been confessed that " all 
work and no play make Jack a dull boy." The same 
law holds in children of the larger growth. The taut bow 
of active manhood must be relaxed at times, or its elasticity 
will certainly be lost. Splendid surroundings cease to 
charm and may become monotonous or positively irk- 
some. The softest couch cannot relieve a mind disturbed. 
For such ills mental panacea is demanded, and this is found 
in games, amusements, entertainments, and the like. 

Any fertile mind can invent something in the nature of a 
game, or can improve upon existing games. Not, probably, 
upon the old standard games, however. Chess, for instance, 
has been studied by the world's master minds, and he is a 
genius indeed who can add anything thereto. But " the 
way we play it," as is so often said, is probably the very 
best way for each special party in the ordinary games, which 
have not been developed to a perfect method. First, as 
pre-eminent for combining healthfulness with pleasure, 
should be considered 

OUT-DOOR GAMES. 

Archery. — One of the oldest of games is Archery. Origi- 
nally a means of warfare and the chase, it has survived that 
use and now flourishes as a pastime. Archery organiza- 
tions are venerable in England and popular in America.

The " York Round " of Archery consists of seventy-two 
arrows at one hundred yards, forty-eight arrows at eighty 
yards, and twenty-four arrows at sixty yards. All public 
matches shot in Great Britain by gentlemen are decided 
upon the result of either a single or double York Round. 

The " National Round," shot by the ladies of Great Bri- 
tain at all public meetings, consists of forty-eight arrows at 
sixty yards and twenty-four arrows at fifty yards. Gener- 
ally the prizes are awarded upon the result of a Double 
National Round. 

The " Columbia Round," adopted for this country, con- 
sists of twenty-four arrows at thirty yards, twenty-four 
arrows at forty yards, and twenty-four arrows at fifty yards. 
These distances are well suited to the present state of skill 
and practice among ladies, and the ranges and division of 
arrows will be in great favor for the first year or two. It 
will be then time to consider the matter of extending the 
ranges. 

The points sought in scientific archery are (i) Position; 

(2) Nocking the arrow, or properly placing it on the string ; 

(3) Drawing the bow, which must be done to the same dis- 
tance, in the same manner, and in the same time, else irreg- 
ular hitting will result ; (4) Aiming so as to " keep a line " 
and to hit the target ; (5) Loosing the string so that the 
arrow will fly with power and grace. Finger-gloves, touched 
in grease, facilitate the loosing. 

Bows vary in drawing power, those used in the York 
Round averaging about fifty pounds. Arrows are twenty- 
eight inches long, all of the same form, weight, etc. Ar- 
rows are pointed so as to enter the target. A slight blunt- 
ing will vary the flight very materially. Condition of wind 
must be allowed for, as cross winds, or winds toward or 
from the target, all affect the flight. Practice under the in- 
struction of archery manuals and expert marksmen will 
make perfect ; and for pleasant, healthful, out-door exercise 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. ^\\ 

in which gentlemen and ladies can participate, archery will 
prove second to none. 

Base Ball. — By common consent, Base Ball is our national 
game. It is, however, a game exclusively for boys and 
men. It is in no sense a family game. It is attended with 
so many serious injuries and has been so largely relegated 
to professional clubs that interest of the better sort has 
been withdrawn from it to a great extent. Those interested 
should buy Hutching's Base Ball Manual, which contains 
the rules (of which there are over seventy, and most of them 
have many specifications), the interpretations of rules, de- 
cisions of leagues, record of plays, etc. 

Cricket. — This is essentially the national game of England, 
but it is gaining ground in this land. It is played with 
single or double wicket, the latter being the true game. The 
two sides have eleven players each, though a numerical 
allowance is sometimes made for acknowledged superiority 
of players. The m side remains in until all its members but 
one have been put out. The bowler aims to knock down 
the wickets, while the batsman protects them by parrying 
the balls, which are stopped and caught on the field by 
fielders at various points, while the batsman makes his 
" runs," interchanging places with the other batsman. Hoyle 
thus describes the game : 

" We will suppose a party of cricketers turning out for an 
afternoon's sport. Some carry bats, two have cricket balls, 
and several others bear the stumps of which the wickets are 
constructed. They come to the place where the wickets are 
to be set up, or ' pitched.' It is a level field, and the space 
between the wickets, in particular, is flat as a billiard-table. 
Now the bowlers advance, and under their direction the 
wickets are set up. The distance between the wickets is 
twenty-two yards. The distance between the stumps must 
be a little less than the diameter of the cricket ball, so that 



g 1 2 "^^^ HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAR V. 

the ball cannot pass between the stumps without touching 
them and knocking off the bails or little bits of wood placed 
across the top of the stumps. The companions of the 
bowler are now dispersed about the field in various posi- 
tions. . . . They all labor for the same object — namely, to 
stop the ball when it is struck by the batsman, to catch it 
(if possible) before it reaches the ground after being delivered 
from the bat (in which case the batsman is considered caught 
out, and his inning is over), and to throw the ball up, when 
they have stopped it, to the bowler or wicket-keeper as 
quickly as possible. The bowler's desire is to knock down 
the batsman's wicket, while the batsman's province is to 
defend his wicket by striking away the ball as it is bowled 
toward him. Beyond this, he has to judge what balls it will 
be safe for him to strike hard at and what balls he must 
content himself with blockmg, or striking down ; for on the 
number of runs he obtains will depend the share he con- 
tributes to the success of his side." 

For the detailed rules of Cricket, see Hoyle's Games. An 
English publication, James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual^ 
is full of valuable information. 

Croquet. — This game is so well known and so generally 
played, that no better service can be rendered than — waiving 
the questions of variety in arrangement and apparatus — to 
give the generally accepted rules for the play. 

THE LAWS OF CROQUET. 

1. At the outset two of the party are chosen chiefs, one for each side. 
These two determine which shall have the first choice of players. Each plays 
a ball from the starting-point, and he who, with one blow of the mallet, drives 
his ball nearest the turning-stake wins the first choice. 

2. The chief who has won the first choice of players opens the game. 

3. Each player at starting must place his ball a mallet's length in front of 
the starting-stake and opposite the centre of the first arch. 

4. A player may play in any attitude he chooses, but in striking he must 
use only one hand. 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. ^\% 

5. The ball must be struck with the face of the mallet's head, and the 
stroke must be a distinct blow, and not a push. 

6. The chief who opens the game is followed by the chief of the opposing 
side, and the other players on each side play alternately in accordance with 
the colors marked upon the starting-stake. 

7. If any players play out of his turn, and the error be discovered and 
challenged before another player makes a stroke, the opposing side may either 
compel the delinquent player to replace hi» ball in its original position, or they 
may allow it to remain where it was played. But any advantage to himself or 
disadvantage to his opponents, occasioned by misplay, must be immediately 
rectified. 

8. If the adverse side fail to challenge the misplay before another player 
has commenced, no penalty is attached, but the offending party cannot use his 
next turn, having already anticipated it. 

9. Should a player, by mistake or otherwise, use a wrong ball, he must 
suffer the consequences, and not the rightful owner of the ball. If the 
error be discovered and challenged before the turn is completed, the ball must 
be restored to the position it occupied previous to the misplay, and any dam- 
ages sustained by the adverse side by reason of the misplay must be repaired 
and the offending player deprived of his turn. But if the misplay be not chal- 
lenged previous to the next player commencing to play, the game proceeds as 
if no misplay had occurred, and no penalty is attached. 

10. Each player continues to play so long as he makes a count in the 
game ; that is, so long as he drives his ball through the next arch in order, 
strikes the turning-stake in order, or achieves either roquet, croquet, or roquet- 
croquet, or a combination of two or more of these. Failing to accomplish 
either of these, he relinquishes his turn to the next player. (See Law 26.) 

1 1 . The balls must pass through the arches in their regular consecutive 
order and in the proper direction of the course. If a ball be driven through 
an arch out of regular order, or from the wrong side, it does not count any 
more than if it had passed over any other portion of the ground. When a ball 
passes properly through an arch it is said to " make its arch.'' 

12. A ball makes its arch when it passes through it in its proper consecu- 
tive order, from either of the following causes only : 

I. When it is driven through by a blow from its owner's mallet. 
II. When it passes through from roquet, croquet, roquet-croquet, or 
ricochet. 
III. When it is driven through by concussion ; that is, by a blow from 
another ball driven against it by roquet, croquet, roquet-croquet, or 
ricochet. 



614 THE HO USE WIFE' S LIBRAE Y. 

13. A ball is considered to have passed through its arch if it cannot be touched 
by the handle of the mallet when moved from the top to the base of the arch, 
from wire to wire, on the side from which the ball passed. 

14. Should a ball be driven only partially through its arch in the wrong 
direction, it is not in a position to be driven back and through in the right 
direction . 

15. If a player can drive his ball through two arches by one stroke, or pass 
it through an arch and against the turning-stake, he may lay his mallet on the 
spot where his ball stopped, place it in any direction that is most useful to 
him, and put his ball at the end of the mallet. 

16. Striking the turning -stake is equivalent to making an arch, subject to 
the same conditions, and enjoying the same privileges; with this exceptional 
advantage, the stake may be struck from any direction. (See Laws 12 
and 15.) 

17. When a ball has completed the round and has struck the starting -stake, 
either by a stroke from its owner's mallet or by roquet, roquet-croquet, cro- 
quet, or by concussion, it becomes a dead ball, and must be removed from 
the field. 

18. When a ball has completed an entire round with the exception of 
striking the starting-stake, it becomes a Rover, and may either go out by strik- 
ing the starting-stake, or may continue its play at large all over the field, sub- 
ject to the conditions and limitations hereafter specified. 

19. A Rover may play upon all the balls one after another, but on no one 
ball twice in the same turn. 

20. A Rover must roquet, roquet-croquet, or croquet in order to continue 
his play. 

21. Should a Rover strike the starting-stake, as specified in Law 17, it 
becomes a dead ball, and must be removed from the field. 

22. When one ball strikes another it is a roquet, and this holds good whether 
the ball striking it proceeds direct from a stroke of the mallet, or rebounds 
upon it from a stake, arch, or any other fixed obstacle, or from another ball 
which it has previously struck. 

23. When a ball roquets another, it may strike the roqueted ball again without 
any intermediate play, but this does not constitute another roquet. If, how- 
ever, either ball in this second stroke be driven through its proper arch, the 
arch shall be counted as passed, but the playing ball is not entitled to another 
stroke. 

24. A ball having made a roquet, may either croquet, or roquet-croquet the 
roqueted ball, or proceed on its round. 

25. When a ball roquets two or more balls by one blow of the mallet, it 
constitutes what is called a ricochet. 



^ GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. ^15 

56. A ball terminates its tour of play when, without making an arch or 
striking a turning-stake, it roquets a ball which it has croqueted. (See 
Law lo.) 

27. A ball may only croquet that ball upon which it has made a roquet. 

28. A player maycroquet any number of balls consecutively ; but he cannot 
croquet the same ball the second time during the same turn without first send- 
ing his own ball through the next arch in order, or hitting the turning-stake. 

29. A player must perceptibly move the ball he croquets. 

30. In making ricochet, a player may croquet the first or all of the balls at 
his option, but the order of croquet must be the same as that of ricochet. 

31 . If a ball roquet another, and with the same stroke make its arch, it may 
croquet the roqueted ball, or refuse to do so, and again roquet it before mak- 
ing the croquet, or it may proceed to make another arch. 

32. While executing the croquet, if a ball flinch, the shot is void, and the 
croqueted ball must be replaced in its former position. The croqueting ball 
may then proceed with its turn, but it cannot repeat the croquet just 
missed. 

33. The laws of roquet-croquet are precisely the same as those which govern 
the croquet, and a player may roquet- croquet any ball that has been roqued. 

34. After making roquet, a player may take two chances by roquet-croquet. 

35. Should a ball in its progress over the ground be interrupted by any one, 
the player to whoni it belongs may either allow it to remain where it stopped 
after its interruption, or remove it to the point it probably would have reached 
had no interruption occurred. 

36. Should a ball be accidentally displaced, it must be restored to its proper 
position before the game can proceed. 

37. Should an arch or stake lose its upright position from any cause, it must 
be restored before the play proceeds. 

38. No play is permitted outside the limits of the ground. A ball driven 
beyond the limits must be immediately placed on the ground at the point 
where it crossed the boundary. A ball so placed may be played upon by 
friend or foe. 

39. If one ball roquets another, and either or both balls go beyond the 
bounds, either or both shall be replaced, and the roqueting ball may play on 
the roqued ball the same as if neither had been driven off the bounds. 

40. Players on the same side may advise each other upon a stroke, but not 
assist in making it. 

41. The game is finished when all the players on one side have made all 
the arches and struck the two stakes. 

42. The umpire is chosen by the two chiefs. 



Ql Q THE HO USE WIFE'S LIBRAR Y. 

43. The decision of the umpire is final. His duties are, to decide when 
balls are fairly struck ; to restore balls to their places which have been 
disturbed by accident ; to decide whether a croqueted ball is moved or not, 
in doubtful cases ; and to settle all other disputed points which may arise 
during the progress of the game. 

Lawn Tennis. — Lawn Tennis is the destined game of the 
future. " How does it compare with croquet ?" was asked 
of an expert in both games. " As a wedding does with a 
funeral," was the answer. 

As in croquet, gentlemen and ladies may play at Tennis ; 
yet in this there is so much of action that for the youthful 
and vigorous it has special charms. 

It should be played on a level, well-cut lawn. Rubber- 
soled shoes should be worn to insure sure footing and pro- 
tect the turf. Sets packed in strong boxes can be had from 
;^4.oo to ;^35.00 in price. The set contains bats, or racquets ; 
regulation balls, net poles, net thirty -six feet long, boundary 
pegs, lines and runners, mallet, and book of instructions, 
which gives full directions for constructing the court and 
conducting the game. 

The fact that to play the game requires the set, and that 
this always includes the printed rules, makes it unnecessary 
to give rules here. Suffice it to say that the game consists 
in serving or delivering the ball from the racquet over the 
net from one court or area into another, the opposing party 
returning the ball in similar manner. The game may be 
played by two, three, or four persons. The skill required 
for correct service, the agility in catching the balls and dex- 
terity in managing them, the opportunity of scoring afforded 
by good play on your own part and by poor play of the an- 
tagonists, combine to make the game very attractive and 
healthful. 

BOARD GAMES. 

Chess. — Chess is unquestionably the chief of board games. 
It is played upon a board containing sixty-four squares, 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. gl7 

with two sets of differently colored pieces, or men ; each 
set having sixteen pieces, of which eight are pawns, having 
the same value and moves ; the others, with their special 
value and moves, being for each set a king, a queen, two 
bishops, two knights, and two castles or rooks. Upon this 
game volumes of profound depth have been written, and 
journals are exclusively devoted to its discussion. In the 
brief space here available, so abstruse a game cannot be 
discussed with fullness or even fairness. Those interested 
need a Chess Manual and the instruction of an expert. 

Checkers. — This is an ancient game, a sort of infantile 
Chess, played upon the same board, and using twelve pieces 
for each side, arranging them on alternate squares in the 
three outer rows of the board. The advances are made 
from each side by moves on the diagonal squares, the one 
having the right to move "jumping" any unprotected 
enemy on an adjacent diagonal, so reducing the number of 
his opponent's pieces. When a piece reaches the outer 
row on its opposite side it becomes a " king," privileged to 
move either way. This is " crowned " by placing another 
piece on top of it. The one jumping all his opponents first 
wins the game. The game for a lively spurt may be re- 
versed, the one losing all his pieces first becoming the win- 
ner. This is called " Give Away." 

> 

Backgammon. — This game is played on the inner side of 
the ordinary chess or checker board. It requires fifteen 
checker pieces and a set of dice for each of the two players. 
The board has twenty-four points colored alternately of two 
different colors. The pieces are arranged on eight of the 
points for each side, the position of each set corresponding 
precisely to that of its opponent. Moves are made as de- 
termined by the throwing of dice, each party advancing his 
men around the board and aiming at two objects; ist, to 
leave no single piece exposed which might be taken up by 



618 TBE HOUSE WIFE'S LIBRAE Y. 

the opponent ; 2d, to catch up any exposed piece of the 
opponent. Pieces can be taken up when they stand alone 
on a point and the move to be made by the other side 
reaches that unprotected piece. The piece so taken up can- 
not resume play until it is re-entered on a point correspond- 
ing in number to one on the dice thrown by its owner. 
When all the pieces of a side have been gathered into the 
final or home table, the player may throw off any of them 
from points corresponding to the dice thrown. If he has 
none to correspond, he must move up the required number 
of points, or, if this cannot be done, he may play off his 
next highest piece or pieces, as may be needed. The party 
first getting all his pieces off wins. If any of the loser's 
pieces are not then in his home table he is gammoned, which 
is equal to two ordinary beats or hits. If the winner throws 
off all his men before the loser gets his last man to his own 
side of the board, it is a backgammon, equal to three hits. 
The numbers thrown on the dice must be played, unless it 
is impossible by reason of pre-occupancy of points, when 
the throw is lost. If doublets be thrown, the player has four 
moves instead of two. 

Russian Backgammon. — In this game all the men are en- 
tered into the same table according to the throws. Both 
sets follow the same route on the board, neither side moving 
out of the first table till all its men are duly entered, and 
neither throwing off any men until all of his pieces have 
reached the terminal table. This game is longer and far 
more stubborn than the ordinary form. 

Bagatelle. — This is to Billiards as Checkers is to Chess — 
a diminutive member of the same family. He who plays 
the superior game seldom takes interest in the other. It is 
played on a board varying in length to suit the desires of 
purchasers. Cups are set in the board flush with its surface, 
into which ivory balls are driven with a cue, the plays all 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. . gl9 

being from the opposite end of the board. These cups 
have different values, upon which the count is made. They 
vary in number from nine to fifteen. Various games are 
played on the same, or very similar boards, for which 
directions are furnished on the purchase of the apparatus. 

Other Board Games. — Among the many folding-board 
games which are deemed specially good may be named 
Parchesi, Stella, Falconry, Spider and Fly, Go Bang, Rus- 
sian Tivoli, Fox and Geese, Solitare, The Captive Princess, 
Cats and Mice, Ambuscadej Steeple Chase Game, John 
Gilpin, The Pilgrim's Progress, and The Monopolist. 

CARD GAMES. 

Aside from the ordinary playing-cards with their almost 
limitless varieties, there is a splendid assortment of other 
cards, both instructive and amusing. Every stationer and 
toy-dealer has these at various prices and with full directions 
for playing. 

MENTAL GAMES. 

Dictionary. — A long but familiar word is announced to a 
company and two minutes are allowed in which to write all 
the words which can possibly be formed from the letters of 
the assigned word. Any word of two or more letters is 
allowed, proper names and foreign terms excepted. Any 
letter of the assigned word may be used twice or oftener in 
any written word. At the end of two minutes the writing 
stops and each list is read. Every word which two or more 
persons have written is stricken from the lists ; every word 
written by one only counts for the writer as many as there 
are parties in the game. If five play, each exclusive word 
counts its writer five, etc. The party announcing the word 
does not write, but is counted, and directs the reading of 
the written words in turn from his rie^ht 



Q20 THE HOUSEWIFE'S LIBRARY. 

Twenty Questions. — This game was once so popular among 
the Cambridge professors that they declared any subject 
could be reached in ten questions. The company divides 
into questioners and answerers. After the subject is chosen, 
questions are asked in some such form as this : Is it animal, 
vegetable, or mineral ? What is its size ? To what age 
does it belong ? Is it historical or natural ? Is it ancient 
or modern ? etc. A few objects do not belong clearly to 
either of these classes, or they touch, possibly, on all three ; 
but even these can be mastered. The questioners may con- 
sult openly about their question before asking it, but the 
answerers must be very cautious in consultation lest they 
disclose too much. Among the more difficult subjects are 
such as a mummy, a tear, a blush, a smile, an echo, an ava- 
lanche, a drought, etc. Puns and evasive answers must not 
be used. 

The Secretary. — All the players sit at a table and are fur- 
nished with paper and pencil. Each writes his name, and 
having folded it back carefully, hands his paper to the secre- 
tary, who shuffles the papers, distributes them again, and 
says, " Character ;" whereupon each writes a supposed trait 
of character. The papers are again folded, reshuffled, and 
redistributed, when " Future" is announced, and each writes 
to this idea on his slip. Other points, not to exceed six in 
all, are named and written upon, and the whole list is then 
read from each paper, affording a most amusing record. 

Ehyming Grame. — The leader selects a word capable of 
many rhymes. Beginning with the first of the company, he 
says, for example, " I have a word that rhymes with one!' 

" Is it a female recluse ?" asks the party addressed. 

" No, it is not a mtii!' is replied. Passing on to the second 
person, this one may ask, *' Is it something good to eat ?" 

" No, it is not a bimr The third may ask, " Is it a heavy 
weight ?" 



*^ 



Ai^al-' 



GAMES, AMUSEMENTS, ETC. 621 

" No, it is not a ton!' The fourth may ask, " Is it some- 
thing that makes you laugh ?" 

" Yes, it is Fun!' 

The party failing to question promptly pays a forfeit ; so 
does the leader if he fail to answer promptly. The party 
catching his word becomes the new leader. 

Acting Game. — Half the players go out of the room and 
those within decide on a word, telling the others a word 
with which it rhymes. The outer party then enter and act 
out a word which they suppose to be correct. For instance, 
if the word rhymes with main, the actors come in with 
umbrellas, overshoes, waterproofs, stepping carefully, etc., 
and the inside party says, " No, it is not rain!' The outs 
retire to consult, and, returning with bags and baggage, imi- 
tate passengers hurrying to get on the cars. " No, it is not 
train!' Again they retire, consult, and re-enter. One of 
them with a mock club strikes a companion, who falls to the 
ground. " Yes, it is Slain!' The sides then exchange 
places. If the word is not guessed, either as announced by 
its rhyme or as acted, the party failing goes out again. 

Crambo. — Each player writes a noun and a question. All 
are then shuffled, nouns together and questions. Each 
player then draws one from each set of slips and writes four 
lines in rhyme, answering the question and introducing the 
word. The. efforts to meet these requirements will provoke 
an abundance of fun. 

FUN IN GENERAL. 

Going to Jerusalem.— Place a row of chairs, alternating 
backs and fronts, and one less in number than the parties in 
the game. A march tune is then played, and the pilgrims 
move around the line of chairs. Suddenly the music stops, 
when each one tries to drop into a seat. Of course one 
person is left. He retires from the game and a chair is 



g22 ^-^^ HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY. 

removed from the line. The music and marching are re- 
peated, and another party is dropped, and so on till one 
remains in occupancy of the one chair. This person is victor 
in the contest. 

Magic Music. — One person leaves the room and the others 
agree on something, no matter how difficult if only practi- 
cable, which he must do. He enters to music, which is loud 
as he nears his point of operation and soft as he departs.' 
By this modulation he is guided to the thing desired and 
almost inevitably does in the end the precise act intended. 

Magnetized Cane. — Let a gentleman prepare beforehand 
by attaching to his pantaloons, above the knee and from one 
leg to the other, a fine black-silk strand about fifteen or 
eighteen inches long. Proposing in the company to mag- 
netize a cane, let him take such an article and rub it faith- 
fully. Then, standing it erect between his separated knees, 
and carefully poising it with his hands, let it lean against 
the stretched thread of silk. It will seem to stand alone, 
to the amazement of the uninitiated, who will struggle 
hard to accomplish the same feat. 

The Charmed Quarter. — Let the company select one of three 
quarter-dollars and mark it so as to know it certainly. The 
other two meanwhile are laid on a marble mantel. Let the 
company all handle the piece and examine the mark ; then, 
having tossed it into a hat — the other two quarters being 
lightly tipped into the same receptacle and all shaken up for 
an instant — a touch will indicate the marked coin, as by 
handling it will have become warm ; the others, by lying on 
the marble, having become cold. The detection is almost in- 
evitable. If it fail, more " magnetism," imparted by a longer 
holding of it in the hand of a spectator, will disclose the 
correct coin. 

Dynamite. — Cross three wooden toothpicks as if they 
were spokes in a wheel, but leave the side spaces larger

than the other two. Cross two other picks over two ends 
of these and under one of them, so as to bind the five in a 




tight frame. On this lay a sixth toothpick to represent 
John Chinaman on his bed. Then apply a match to one 
end of the frame pieces. This represents the Hoodlum

blowing up the Chinaman. When the fire creeps in to the 
point where the picks cross and bind each other, the spring 
of the wood will hurl the Chinaman high in the air, illustra- 
ting dynamite action, and causing a hearty laugh. 

Parlor Magic. — An immense amount of fun can be had by 
means of the parlor magic, or trick sets, to be had in great 
variety. Some of the exploits thus attainable are quite 
puzzling to the observer, especially if the manipulator be 
dexterous, and, withal, entertaining of speech. Sets of appa- 
ratus carry also complete instruction, but practice is needed 
to make perfect. 

Manuals on Games, Amusements, etc. — On all points of home 
amusement there are valuable treatises or manuals — some 
large, some small, but all suggestive. If enjoyment is 
sought in a house, the means of enjoyment must be studied. 
Study, therefore, to make home happy. 



NINTH DEPARTMENT. 



General Hints. 



So many and so rich are earth's resources, that, when the wisest man has 
wearied with his discourse, numberless things remain unsaid — yea, quite 
unthought of — by the sage. 

BUFFON. 



General Hints. 



AFTER the broad scope of this book has been covered, 
there still remain many things to be said. They are 
hardly worth discussion ; mere statement is sufficient. 
They are hints merely on a variety of subjects. Let it not 
be supposed that every suggestion here given has been 
subjected to test by the editor of the department. But 
every one has been culled from a trustworthy source and 
has been subjected to careful scrutiny. All of them are 
worth 'trying; but try them conscientiously. More pre- 
scriptions have failed from unskillful handling than from 
inherent defect. An Irish cook who delayed some fifteen 
minutes when his master had ordered a soft-boiled egg, 
excused himself by declaring that it had boiled fast all the 
time, but showed no signs whatever of becoming soft. So 
many other domestic manipulators fail. 

HINTS FOR THE KITCHEN. 

To Keep Meat Fresh. — Take a quart of best vinegar, two 
ounces of lump sugar, two ounces of salt. Boil these 
together for a few minutes, and when cold anoint with a 
brush the meat to be preserved. For fish the mixture is to 
be applied inside ; for poultry, both in and outside. Or : 
Place the meat in the centre of a clean earthenware vessel 
and closely surround it with common charcoal. Or : Cover 
the meat lightly with bran and hang it in some passage 
where there is a current of air. 

To Make Poultry Tender. — Give the fowl, shortly before 
killing, a tablespoonful of vinegar.

To Test MusJirooms. — In eatable mushrooms the stalk and 
top are dirty white and the lower part has a lining of salmon 
fringe, which changes to russet or brown soon after they 
are gathered. The poisonous manifest all colors, and those 
which are dead white above and below should be let alone. 
Sprinkle salt on the spongy part, and if they turn yellow 
they are poisonous, but if they become black they are 
good. Let the salt remain on a little while before you 
decide on the color. Mushrooms are in season during 
September and October. 

To Keep Flour Sweet. — Insert a triangular tube of boards 
or tin bored full of small holes, into the centre of the barrel, 
which allows the air to reach the middle of the meal, and it 
never gets musty. A barrel of good flour, dry as it appears 
to be, contains from twelve to sixteen pounds of water. 

To Test Coal Oil. — Pour a little oil in an iron spoon and 
heat it over a lamp until it is moderately warm to the 
touch. If the oil produces vapor which can be set on fire 
by a flame held a short distance above the liquid, it is bad. 

To Remove Clinkers. — Throw half a dozen broken oyster 
shells into the fire when the coal is all aglow, and cover 
them with fresh coal. When all are red hot the clinkers 
become doughy, and are easily removed. 

Cheap Pire-Kindler. — Melt three pounds of rosin in a quart 
of tar, and stir in as much saw-dust and pulverized charcoal 
as you can. Spread the mass upon a board till cool, then 
break into lumps as big as your thumb. Light it with a 
match. 

To Keep a Broom. — If a broom be inserted every week in 
boiliiig suds, it will be toughened and last much longer, will 
not cut the carpet, and will remain elastic as a new broom. 

To Preserve On-cloths. — An oil-cloth should never be 
scrubbed ; but after being swept it should be cleaned with 



GENERAL HINTS. 629 

a soft cloth and lukewarm or cold water. Never use soap, 
or water that is hot. When dry, sponge it over with milk ; 
then wipe with a soft, dry cloth. 

To Prevent a Lamp from Smoking. — Soak the wick in vine- 
gar, and dry it well before using. 

To Remove Rust from Steel. — Cover with sweet oil, well 
rubbed on, and let it remain forty-eight hours, then rub 
with unslacked lime powdered fine. 

To Prevent Rnst. — Take one pint of fat-oil varnish, mixed 
with five pints of highly rectified spirits of turpentine, and 
rub with a sponge on bright stoves or mathematical instru- 
ments, and they will never contract spots of rust. 

To Freshen Stale Bread or Cake. — Plunge the loaf one 
instant in cold water and lay it upon a tin in the stove for 
ten or fifteen minutes. It will be like new bread, without 
its deleterious qualities. Stale cake is thus made as nice as 
new cake. Use immediately. 

To Soften Hard Water. — Put half an ounce of quicklime in 
nine quarts of water. This solution in a barrel of hard 
water will make it soft. A teaspoonful of sal soda will 
soften from three to four pails of hard water. 

Time of Boiling Green Vegetables. — This depends very much 
upon the age, and how long they have been gathered. The 
younger and more freshly gathered, the more quickly they 
are* cooked. The following is Miss Parloa's time-table for 
cooking : 



Potatoes, boiled, . . 30 minutes. 
Potatoes, baked, . -45 minutes. 
Sweet Potatoes, boiled, 45 minutes. 
Sweet Potatoes, baked, . ' i hour. 
Squash, boiled, . . 25 minutes.

* Keeping Hams. — After smoking, make coarse cotton cloth 
sacks so that one ham will go in easily, pack cut hay all 
around between the sack and the ham, tie the sack at the 
top, hang in a cool place, and be sure the sacks are whole. 

To Make SMrts Glossy. — Take of raw starch, one ounce ; 
gum arabic, one drachm; white of Q^'g, half ounce; soluble 
glass, quarter of an ounce ; water. Make starch into fine 
cream, dissolve with gum in a little hot water, cool and mix 
it with the ^g%, and beat up the mixture with starch liquid; 
then add the water, glass (solution), and shake together. 
Moisten the starched linen with a cloth dipped in the liquid, 
and use polishing iron to develop gloss. 

Blackening Stoves. — If a little vinegar or cider is mixed 
with stove polish it will not take so much rubbing to make 
the stove bright, and the blackening is not likely to fly off 
in fine dust. 

Musty Coffee and Tea Pots. — These may be cleaned and 
sweetened by putting wood ashes into them and filling 
them with cold water. Set on the stove to heat gradually 
till the water boils. Let it boil a short time, then put aside 
to cool, when the inside should be faithfully washed and 
scrubbed in hot soap-suds. 

To Clean Pots and Kettles. — When washing greasy pots and 
kettles, take a handful of meal or bran and rub all around. 
It absorbs all the grease and leaves them perfectly clean. 

To Clean Ceilings Smoked by Kerosene Lamps. — Wash with a 
sufficiently strong solution of soda in water. 

To Prepare a New Iron Kettle for Use. — Fill with clean potato 
parings ; boil them for an hour or more, then wash the 
kettle with hot water, wipe it dry, and rub it with a little 
lard ; repeat the rubbing half a dozen times after using. 

To Remove Fruit Stains. — Procure a bottle of Javelle water. 
If the stains are wet with this before the articles are put 



GENERAL HINTS, 



631 



into the wash they will be completely removed. Those who 
cannot get Javelle water can make a solution of chloride of 
lime. Four ounces of the chloride of lime is to be put into 
a quart of water in a bottle, and after thoroughly shaking 
allow the dregs to settle. The clear liquid will remove the 
stains. Be careful to thoroughly rinse the article in clear 
water before bringing it in contact with soap. When Javelle 
water is used this precaution is not necessary; with chloride 
of lime liquid it is, or the article will be harsh and stiff. 

Washing. — To wash flannels : First, never apply soap 
directly to any woolen fabric. Make a strong, hot suds and 
plunge the garment in it. Second, never dip a flannel in 
cold, or even cool, water, but always hot. Wash first in hot 
suds and rinse in hot water made very blue. Third, dry 
flannels as quickly as possible. Wring dry from the second 
water and hang either in the hot sun or before a brisk fire. 
When nearly dry, press with a hot iron. None but soft 
water should be used upon flannels, and resin soap is much 
inferior to common soft soap, as it hardens the fibres of 
woolens. 

To wash chintz : Take two pounds of rice and boil it in 
two gallons of water till soft. When done, pour the whole 
in a tub ; let it stand till of about the warmth you use in 
general for colored linens ; then put the chintz in and use 
the rice instead of soap. Wash it in this till the dirt appears 
to be out ; then boil the same quantity, as above, but strain 
the rice from the water and mix it in warm, clear water. 
Wash in this till quite clean ; afterward rinse it in the water 
in which you have boiled the rice. This will answer the 
end of starch and no dew will affect it and it will be stiff as 
long as you wear it. 

To wash clothes without fading them : Peel Irish pota- 
toes and grate them in cold water. Saturate the articles to 
be washed in this potato-water and they can then be washed 



632 ^-^^ HOUSEWIFE' S LIBRARY, 

with soap without any running of the color. Oil may be 
taken out of carpets with this potato-water when simple cold 
water would make the color run ruinously. This will also 
set the color in figured black muslins, in colored merinos, 
in ribbons, and other silk goods. Often the potato-water 
cleanses sufficiently without the use of soap ; but the latter 
is necessary where there is any grease. When no soap is 
needed, take the grated potato and rub the goods with a 
flannel rag. 

Sour milk removes iron-rust from white goods. 

To make silk which has been wrinkled appear exactly like 
new, sponge it on the surface with a weak solution of gum 
arable or white glue, and iron on the wrong side. 

A tablespoonful of black pepper put in the first water in 
which gray or buff linens are washed will keep them from 
spotting. It will also keep the colors of colored or black 
cambrics or muslin from running, and does not harden the 
water. 

To extract ink from cotton, silk, and woolen goods, satu- 
rate the spot with spirits of turpentine and let it remain 
several hours ; then rub it between the hands. It will dis- 
appear without injuring the color or texture of the fabric. 
For linen, dip the spotted part in pure tallow and the ink 
will disappear. 

When clothes have acquired an unpleasant odor by being 
kept from the air, charcoal laid in the folds will remove it. 

To take oil or grease from cloth : Drop on the spot 
some oil of tartar or salt of wormwood which has been left 
in a damp place until it is fluid ; then immediately wash the 
place with lukewarm soft water and then with cold water, 
and the spot will disappear.
