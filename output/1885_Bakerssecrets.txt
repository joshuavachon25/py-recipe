\ 

I' How many women pass by Bake Shops, every 
day, and look in the windows at the tempting ar- 
ray of fine baked viands, and exclaim; "Oh, if I 
could only bake such bread and cakes. !" Now 
the opportunity is offered, and you have only to 
purchase "Bakers' Secrets," to have your wish 
;yratified. This is the only book of the kind, 
ever put before the public, at so small a cost, em- 
bracing as it does years of experience in the bak- 
ing business, which has given me sufficient op- 
portunity to collect and test a number of the 
most valuable receipts, known to the Baking trade. 
Being a practical baker myself, and having 
.'ised these receipts every day for the past ten 
'years, I put them before you with the guarantee 
that every receipt has been fully and scieutifical' 
ly tested. They are not copied from other recipt 
books, but from actual experience, and careful 
study, which warrants me in presenting them to 
you, with the full assurance of their merits. 
iVou need not be worried any more about your 
bread not being good, or your cakes being "sog- 
?y." If you but follow the directions in this 
30ok, you will never fail, but be envied by all 
rour friends.

4 Bakers' Secrets. 

RELIABLE YEAST. 

The lirst tlnng to take into consideration, in 
making good bread, is the yeast. Take 

2 ounces of hops, 

2 quarts of water, 

2 quarts of potatoes, 

4 ounces of white sngar, 

4 ounces of salt, 

1 tablespoonful of ginger, 
1 cake of dry hop yeast. 
RkMxVRKs: Heat the water to the boiling point, 
then add hops, and let boil one minute. Remove 
from the kettle quickly, to prevent discoloring 
the liquid. Lot it stand until lukewarm, then add 
potatoes well mashed, sugar, salt, ginger and 
yeast. Let it stand in a warm place for twenty- 
four honrs, or until it thoroughly ferments. It is 
now ready for use. Keep it in a stone jar in the 
cellar. 



STOCK YEAST. 

2 ounces of hops, 

1 ounce of malt, 
4 ounces of flour, 

2 quarts of water, 

1 yeast cake, or a half cupful 
of stock yeast. 

Remarks: Boil hops, same as in reliable yeast, 
then pour quickly in an earthern jar. Then add 
flour while it is hot, so as to cook the flour. Beat 
all the lumps out, and let it stand until lukewarm, 
then add the yeast and sprinkle the malt over 
the top. Let it stand in a warm place until fer- 
mented. To use this, yon will have to make whatt 
we term ferment. 

Note'. This yeast will keep good about three' 
weeks. 



Bakers' Secrets. 



FERMENT. 



G raediurn sized potatoes, 

'I quarts of water, 

2 ounces of flour, 

\ cupful of stock yeast. 
Remarks : Have potatoes hot, and pour one 
pint of hot water on them. Add flour and mix 
thoroughly, until the potatoes are all mashed fine. 
Then add remainder of water and yeast. Let 
stand about twelve hours in a warm place, then it 
is ready for use. 

Note: This will keep good one week. 



BREAD. 

The first thing required for good bread, (after 
the yeast,) is good flour. Always get the best 
flour obtainable, that is just the secret of good 
bread. All bakers use Western spring wheat 
flour, for it is the strongest, and makes the largest 
loaf from the least flour. They use winter wheat 
flour for pastry, because it is softer, and takes less 
shortening. It would be best for you to have 
both kinds always on hand, and remember that 
the best flour is the cheapest. 



6 Bakers' S^ep^ts, 

RELIABLE YEAST BREAD. 

FOR SIX LOAVES. 

2 quarts of water, 

G medium size potatoes, 

2 table spoonfuls of white sugar, 

2 tablespoon fuls of salt, 

^ cupful of reliable yeast, 

\ pound of lard or butter. 
Remarks : Mash potatoes fine, and pour one 
quart of warm water on them. Strain through a 
colander. Add sugar, salt and yeast. Add 
enough flour to make a stift* batter. Let it stand 
in a warm place over night, and in the morning 
add remaining quart of water, and lard. Mix all 
thoroughly, then knead into a slack dough. Let 
it stand about one hour then mould in loaves. Let 
it get light, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Note: The more you knead dough, the finer 
grained the bread will be. 

STOCK YEAST BREAD. 

FOR SIX MEDIUM SIZE LOAVES. 

3 pints of ferment, 

1 pint of warm Avater, 

2 ounces of salt, 

3 ounces of sugar, 
J pound of lard. 

Remarks: Mix up the ferment in a slack 
dough, in the morning. Let it rise about three 
hours, then add water, sugar, salt and lard, and 
knead into a slack dough. Lut it rise about one 
hour, then mould in loaves, let it rise and bake in 
a moderately hot oven. 

Note: To prevent a hard crust from forming 
on 3^our bread, after it is moulded, put it in a 
cupboard, and place a pail of hot water under it, 
or just set it over a pan of hot water, so it will 
steam.

FLEISCIIMANN'S COMPRESSED YEAST 
BREAD. 

FOR SIX LOAVES. 

1 cake of yeast. 

2 quarts of water, 
4 ounces of sugar, 
Z ounces of salt, 

^4 ounces of lard. 

Remarks: Dissolve the yeast in one quart of 
warm water. Make into a slack dough, and let it 
stand in a warm place, over night. In the morn- 
ing add another quart of water, sugar, salt and 
lard. Break sponge thoroughly, then mix to a 
slack dough. Let it stand about one hour, then 
mould into loaves, let them rise and then bake. 

Note'. It improves the looks of bread, and also 
moistens the crust, to brush over with melted 
butter, as soon as it is out of the oven. 



BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

1 quart of sponge, 
1 quart corn meal, 
\ teacupful of molasses. 

Remarks: Set your sponge over night, same 
as for white bread, or take it out in the morning, 
after you have thinned your sponge, v^hich you 
can do for either this bread, graham or rye, and 
even for Vienna bread. Take the corn meal, and 
and make a mush out of it, then add it to the 
sponge, also the molasses. Then knead to a 
slack dough, with the best tiour. Work then^the 
same as Graham bread, only bake longer. 

Note: One half cupful of reliable yeast, three 
pints of ferment, one cake of Fleischmann's com- 
pressed yeast, one and a half cakes of dry yeast, 
are all about the same strength.

ing, add the remaining water and molasses, Mix

stiff enough for a slack dough, make it so with 
wheat flour. Let it rise about one hour, then 
mould in loaves, let it get light and bake in a 
moderate oven. 

Note: In summer, set sponge with cold water, 
in winter with warm. Always keep dough warm

and let it stand in a warm place, over night. In 
the morning, add milk and butter, and knead to a 
slack dough. Let it stand about one hour, then 
mould in long loaves, tapering at the ends. Let 
it get light, then slash lightly across the top with 
a sharp knife, and bake. After it is baked, brush

A'ote: Always have all kinds of bread dough 
slack, and let your sponge get through ferment- 
ing, before working it.

2 eggs, 

^ pound of sugar, 

2 ounces of butter. 
Remarks: Rub the sugar, butter, and eggs to

let them get light. Have your lard hot, then

When they are fried, they will look just the same 
as if they were cut out.

and press the back edge with the thick part of the 
hand. Rolls made this way, look nicer than any 
other way.

dough, and also rusks, by adding a little sugar in 
the sponge. You can always use butter or lard 
in bread.

ISFote: A great many people who do not under- 
stand the elements of carbonate of ammonia, 
suppose it has an injurious effect, but it is not so, 
for when it is exposed to heat, as it would be in 
cakes, it is all evaporated, leaving not a particle 
of sediment, as soda does. It is the best leaven 
for cakes known, as it leaves them pure and 
white, without that strong taste that soda leaves.
