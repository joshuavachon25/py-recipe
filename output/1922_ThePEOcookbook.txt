MEATS 

In selecting beef see that the lean is a clear, bright red, 
the fat firm and a creamy white, never yellow; then you 
may be reasonably sure that meat is fresh and from a young 
animal. In selecting poultry the eyes should be bright, the 
comb red, the nostrils clean and dry, the feet and legs 
smooth and free from scales, the breast plump and the tip 
end of the breastbone soft and yielding to pressure. A fowl 
that has these requirements is young, healthy and at least 
moderately fat. 

The best meat can be ruined by poor cooking, and the 
poorest cut can be made palatable and nutritious by proper 
preparation. A roast or steak should be quickly seared on 
the outside to harden the albumen and retain the juices, 
and then the heat reduced to finish cooking to make the 
inside tender and juicy, otherwise your roast, or steak, will 
be dry and hard; for the same reason never salt your meat 
until it is almost done. Never beat a steak as it crushes the 
fibers, allowing the juices to escape. If the steak is tough, 
and you have time, put three or four tablespoons of oil, or 
melted butter, mixed with an equal amount of vinegar, on 
a platter and place your steak in that for two hours, turning 
every 20 minutes, then cook in the usual manner, or if in 
a hurry take a very sharp knife, and score the meat about 
one-half inch apart each way on both sides. "The chief 
reason for the bad opinion in which fried food is held by 
many is that it always means eating burned fat. When fat 
is heated too high it splits up into fatty acids and glycerin, 
and from the glycerin is formed a substance (Acrolein) 
which is very irritating to the mucous membrane. All will 
recall that the fumes of scorched fat makes the eyes water. 
It is not surprising that such a substance, if taken into the 
stomach, should cause digestive disturbance. Fat in itself 
is a very valuable food, and the objection to fried foods 
because they may be fat seems illogical." — U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture^ Farmers' Bulletin 391. 

In boiling or roasting 15 minutes to the pound and 15 



MEATS. 23 

minutes longer is the rule for beef and mutton, and 20 min- 
utes to the pound and 20 minutes longer for pork, poultry, 
veal and lamb. Allow one-third to one-half pound of raw 
meat for each person to be served, of roast or steak, and one- 
quarter pound if to be used in a pie, or with vegetables or 
dressing. Salt meat should be put on in cold water so that 
it may freshen in cooking. This applies to boiling a ham 
and to ham sliced for frying, if it is too salty. Put the slices 
in a skillet and cover with cold water, heat almost to boiling, 
remove ham and fry in the usual way and it will be sweet and 
tender. Salt meat requires almost half as long again for 
boiling or roasting as fresh meat, due to the effect of salt on 
the tissues. Meat in boiling loses about one-third, in 
roasting the loss is about one-fourth. 

By keeping a supply of dried celery leaves, parsley, bay 
leaf (to be used sparingly), thyme, peppers, whole cloves, 
onions, carrots, horseradish, catsup and Worcestershire 
sauce, any cook need have no trouble in giving variety to 
the flavor of her meat dishes, either by frying in the fat 
before searing the meat, or by adding to the sauce to serve 
with it. 

In making sauces or gravies of the fat, about two table- 
spoonfuls of fat and two tablespoonfuls of flour to one cup 
of milk or other liquid, is melted, then the flour added and 
browned and then the milk added slowly and stirred con- 
stantly until of the right consistency the product will be 
smooth. 

Some of the more common accompaniments to different 
meats are: 

Boiled Beef — Horseradish, good if mixed with a tea- 
spoonful of prepared mustard and a little whipped cream. 

Roast Chicken or Turkey — Cranberry sauce. 

Roast Goose or Pork — Apple sauce. 

Roast Lamb — Mint sauce. 

Boiled Mutton — Caper sauce. 

Broiled Steak — Mushroom sauce. 

Breaded Veal Cutlets — Tomato sauce. 

A Kitchen Bouquet, referred to in many recipes for

soup, may be made as follows: A sprig of parsley, savory 
and thyme, one leaf of sage and one bay leaf. This will 
flavor one gallon of soup if cooked in it one hour, and should 
not remain in it longer. 

BROILED STEAK 
Have steak cut at least ij inches thick. Wipe clean with 
damp cloth and trim off excess fat. Grease broiler so steak 
will not stick. Broil over live coals turning each half 
minute for 3 minutes, after which the steak may be finished 
at a lower temperature, turning every minute or two until 
it is done. Time required varies from 8 to 20 minutes, 
according to thickness of steak and degree of cooking 
desired. Sprinkle a little salt, evenly over a hot platter, 
and place steak on it. Salt and pepper top to taste, dot with 
bits of butter and serve; or you may use any sauce you like, 
but avoid masking the flavor of the meat with one that is 
stronger. Mabel Eberhard. 

PAN BROILING 
Heat a heavy iron frying pan smoking hot without add- 
ing any fat. Sear the meat on both sides. Decrease the 
heat and cook slowly until done, turning every 10 seconds. 

Mabel Eberhard. 

ROUND STEAK 

2 Pounds round steak cut thick, ij inches. Season with 
salt and pepper on both sides. Rub into the meat 2 table- 
spoons of lard or drippings, roll in flour, place in pan and 
half cover with water. Cook ij hours, in slow oven. 
Keep pan covered. Add more water if necessary. 

Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

FRIED STEAK 
Have steak trimmed and ready to fry. Put fat enough 
in heavy iron pan to come to top of steak, but not to cover. 
Heat smoking hot. Dip steak quickly into water, then into 
pan of flour and turn, forming a thick coating on each side. 
Place in hot fat and let fry to a golden brown. Before turn- 
ing sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Turn and fry 



MEATS 3S 

other side the same way, keeping fat quite hot all the time. 
Cook uncovered. Your steak will be tender and juicy with 
crisp, golden crust. 

Mrs. W. M. Cordier, Clearwater, Fla. 

SWISS STEAK 
3 Pounds round steak, ij or 2 inches thick, | cup of 
flour, 2 tablespoons of butter, salt and pepper to taste. 
Pound the steak until tissue is thoroughly broken, adding 
the flour while pounding. Melt butter in frying pan. 
Put in meat and sear on both sides. Add boiling water 
and let simmer 2 or 3 hours, or bake in moderate oven same 
length of time. Mrs. J. J. Morris. 

HAMBURGER STEAK 

I Pound lean beef (round), | teaspoon of salt,-g- teaspoon 
of pepper, i teaspoon chopped celery, i teaspoon onion 
juice. Run meat through grinder, season, shape into small 
flat cakes and pan broil, just rubbing pan with a little fat. 

Mrs. J. J. Morris. 

BAKED STEAK 

Buy thick steak. Broil first, leaving steak rare. Place 
in pan and pour over steak i small bottle of catsup, same 
amount of water, i onion minced, i green pepper cut fine, 
I tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, butter, 
tabasco sauce to taste. Use any vegetable, mushroom, 
asparagus or cauliflower. If the latter cook first in salt 
water. Bake 30 minutes in hot oven. Do not turn. 

Bess S. Parish. 

PLANKED STEAK 

Use sirloin steak, cut 2J inches thick, remove the flank 
end, also the tenderloin and take out bones. The plank 
upon which the steak is cooked should be of oak, and soaked 
in cold water for at least an hour. Heat the broiler and 
place the plank in the oven. Cook the steak in the broiler 
and then remove to the hot plank. Around the edge of 
the plank place mashed potatoes that have been forced out 
of a pastry bag; onions and green peppers may be placed

MEATS 37 

Try out a piece of suet in a Dutch oven, or iron kettle, and 
add lard to make enough fat to brown the roast well. When 
brown on both sides add water enough to barely cover

GENERAL RULES 

Wash thoroughly, pare and scrape, if skins must be re- 
moved. Stand in cold water until cooked, to keep them 
fresh and to prevent them being discolored. Cook in boil- 
ing water; the water must be kept at the boiling point. 
Use I teaspoon salt with i quart water; the salt may be put 
into the water when vegetables are partially cooked. The 
water in which vegetables are cooked is called vegetable 
stock. 

Fresh green vegetables require less water than others. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, onions and turnips should be 
cooked uncovered in a large amount of water. 

All vegetables must be drained as soon as tender. Season 
with salt and pepper and serve with butter or sauce. 

Cold vegetables may be used for soup, salads, or may be 
placed in a baking dish with ^ the quantity of sauce (2 cups 
vegetables and i cup sauce) covered with buttered crumbs 
and browned in a hot oven. 

Canned Vegetables: Wash the can. Empty the con- 
tents from the can as soon as opened, and let the vegetable 
stand some time, that it may become reoxygenated. Beans, 
peas, asparagus, etc., should be drained and rinsed in cold 
water. 



VEGETABLES si 

Dried Vegetables: Wash and soak in cold water 
several hours before cooking.

onion, 3 tablespoons butter, 3 tablespoons flour, J teaspoon 
salt, § teaspoon pepper. Cook onions with tomatoes 15 
minutes, rub through a strainer and add to the butter and 
flour, cooked together. If tomatoes are very acid add a 
few grains of soda. If tomatoes are to retain their red color 
it is necessary to brown butter and flour together before

bread in two-inch slices, and slices in diamonds, squares or 
circles. Remove centers, leaving cases. Brush over with 
melted butter, and brown in oven. Fill with Aspiaragus in 
White Sauce. 

4. Asparagus in Patties: Make the shells of rich 
puff paste and fill with Asparagus in White Sauce. 

Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

ASPARAGUS WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE I. 

If fresh asparagus is used, wash, cut off tough ends, tie 
in bunches so that it will stand erect when placed in boiling 
water. Keep the tips out of the water as it boils, for they 
will cook more quickly than the stems and become too soft 
to look well. When tender remove -from water and drain 
and keep hot until served. If canned asparagus is used, 
drain and cover with boiling water, drain and while hot 
serve with the following sauce: 

HoLLANDAiSE Sauce: § Cup buttcr (soft), yolks of 2 
eggs, I tablespoon vinegar or i tablespoon lemon juice, J 
teaspoon salt and cayenne to taste. Put about half the 
butter, the lemon juice and eggs in a saucepan which is in a 
larger pan containing hot water. Stir constantly and as it 
thickens add gradually the rest of the butter. If it gets too 
hot it separates, so the water in the under pan must be kept 
hot but under the boiling point. When thick remove from 
fire, add salt and cayenne and serve immediately. 

Mrs. C. E. Combe. 

ASPARAGUS WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE II. 

Arrange hot asparagus tips on plates covered with several 
leaves of lettuce and serve with this sauce: 

HoLLANDAiSE Sauce: Beat yolks of 2 eggs, add 2 table- 
spoons lemon juice or vinegar and \ cup boiling water.

Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

DRIED BEANS 

All dried beans require the same preliminary treatment, 
no matter how they are 'to be finally cooked and served. 
Look them over carefully, then wash clean. Soak them 
over night in plenty of cold water. In the morning pour 
ojff the water and put them in a stewpan with cold water 
enough to cover them generously. Let them come to the 
boiling point in this water, then drain. Dried lima beans, 
kidney beans, navy beans, etc., should be treated in this 
manner, then they are ready to be finished in any way 
desired. Maria Parloa, U. S. Dept. of x'\griculture. 

BAKED BEANS. 

3 Cups navy beans, i pound fresh pork, J cup molassesj 
2 tablespoons catsup, salt and pepper to taste. Soak, scald 
and drain the beans as directed above. Put the beans in a

GREEN BEANS 

^ Gallon green beans when prepared, f pods and J shelled 
beans, 3 tablespoons fat, i tablespoon salt, | tablespoon 
sugar. Put fat in aluminum vessel with tight fitting lid. 
When hot enough to fry, add beans, cover tightly and shake 
occasionally. When juice is cooked out of the beans, add 
water to cover, the salt and sugar, and cook briskly. If 
needed add a little hot water at a time while cooking. 
Beans should cook down until only a small amount of gravy 
is left, when they are done. Mrs. J. H. Berry. 

GREEN BEANS 

String and break up beans, shelling those that are large 
enough. Cover with water, season with salt and fat bacon 
or fried meat grease. Cook slowly 3 hours. The water 
should all be cooked out when done. The proportion is 
about I pound of medium bacon to a gallon of beans. 

Mrs. C. a. Taylor. 

WHITE WAX BEANS 

The white wax bean has a light yellow pod and is milder 
in flavor than the green string bean. Wash, break in i-inch 
pieces and cook in boiling salted water until tender, allowing 
2 teaspoons of salt to i quart of water. Drain and serve 
with White Sauce II or with the following sauce:

BUTTER BEANS 

It is best to buy butter beans in the pod and shell them 



VEGETABLES 63 

just before using, as they deteriorate very quickly. Rinse 
in cold water, put in saucepan, cover with boiling water and 
boil until tender, from 26 to 30 minutes. When tender 
there should be little water left. Add i teaspoon salt to 
each quart of beans, a pinch of pepper, and i tablespoon of 
butter; shake the saucepan (do not stir, as that breaks the 
bean) and pour into tureen. 

Butter beans may be served with White Sauce II and i 
tablespoon finely cut parsley or celery tops. 

Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

BEANS AND TOMATOES 

Boil green beans with bacon and season with salt. Cook

Sauce: 2 Tablespoons butter, ^ cup sugar, ^ tablespoon 
cornstarch, | cup vinegar, let boil 5 minutes. Pour over 
beets and let stand on back of range ^ hour. 

BEET GREENS 

Beets are usually thickly sowed, and as the young plants 
begin to grow they must be thinned out. These plants 
make delicious greens, and even the tops of ordinary market 
beets are good if properly prepared. Examine the leaves 
carefully to be sure there are no insects on them, wash 
thoroughly in several waters and put over the fire in a large 
kettle ot boiling water. Add a teaspoon of salt for every 
two quarts of greens; boil rapidly about 30 minutes or until 
tender, drain off the water, chop well and season with butter 
and salt. These may also be seasoned with bacon drippings 
or salt pork. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Blanch brussels sprouts in the following manner: Re- 
move the wilted or yellow leaves from the little heads, cut 
the stalk close to the head and soak in cold salted water for

Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

CABBAGE 

Cabbage is one of our most useful vegetables, being 
available during the late fall, winter and spring months 
when other green vegetables are dif^cult to procure. Be- 
cause of a relatively large amount of sulphur which cabbage 
contains, it is apt to be indigestible and cause flatulence 
when it is improperly cooked. The quickest and simplest 
methods of cooking cabbage are the best. The essentials 
for the proper cooking of this vegetable are plenty of boiling 
water, a hot fire to keep the water boiling all the time, and 
thorough ventilation, that the strong-smelling gases, liber- 
ated by the high temperature may be carried off in the 
steam. 

Young cabbage will cook in 25 or 30 minutes; late in the 
winter it may require 45 minutes. The vegetable when 
done should be crisp and tender, any green portion should 
retain the color, and the white portion should be white and 
not yellow or brown. Overcooked cabbage or cauliflower 
is more or less yellow, has a strong flavor, and is very inferior 
to the same dish properly cooked. In addition, overcooking 
is a cause of digestive disturbances, as well as making a very 
unpalatable dish. — U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Maria 
Parola. 

TO BOIL CABBAGE 

Cut a small head of cabbage into four parts, cutting down 
through the stock. Soak for half an hour in a pan of cold 
water to which has been added a tablespoon of salt; this is 
to draw out any insects that may be hidden in the leaves. 
Take from the water and cut into slices. Have a large stew- 
pan, half full of boiling water; put in the cabbage, pushing 
it under the water with a spoon. Boil ten minutes, drain. 



66 P. E. 0. COOK BOOK 

put on to co^xK again in boiling water. Add one tablespoon 
of salt and cook from fifteen to thirty-five minutes, depend- 
ing upon the age of the cabbage. Turn into a colander and 
drain for about 2 minutes. Put into a chopping bowl and 
mince. Season with butter, pepper and more salt if it 
requires it. Allow a tablespoon of butter to a generous 
pint of the cooked vegetable. Cabbage cooked in this 
manner will be of delicate flavor and may be generally eaten 
without distress. Have the kitchen windows open at the 
top while the cabbage is boiling and there will be little, if 
any, odor of cabbage in the house. 

CREAMED CABBAGE 

I Pint cabbage cooked as directed above chopped 
rather fine. Season with salt if necessary, pepper and i 
cup of White Sauce II. Mix all together and simmer 5 
minutes. 

CABBAGE COOKED WITH PORK 

For a small head of cabbage use about \ pound of mixed 
salt pork. Boil the pork gently for three or four hours. 
Prepare the cabbage as for plain boiled cabbage. Drain 
well and put on to boil with the pork. Boil rapidly for 25 
to 45 minutes. Serve the pork with the cabbage. Ham or 
corned beef may be substituted for the pork. 

CABBAGE WITH SAUSAGE 

6 Sausages, i quart boiled minced cabbage, J teaspoon 
pepper, salt if necessary. Fry the sausages crisp and brown. 
Take from the frying pan and pour off all but 3 tablespoons 
of the fat. Put the minced cabbage in the frying pan and 
cook 6 minutes. Arrange in a hot dish and garnish with 
the sausages. Serve mashed potatoes with this dish.

creamed butter and mix with the meat, chopped cabbage 
and seasoning. Form into a ball and place in the cabbage 
head. Refold the leaves and bake three to four hours, 
basting with butter and water. Serve on a round hot 
platter with the gravy from the pan. 

CABBAGE ROLLS 

Cabbage leaves may be stuffed with boiled rice or meat 
mixture, roll and tie. Boil until tender and serve with 
Tomato Sauce. 

SAUER KRAUT 

The outside leaves of cabbage should be removed, the 
core cut crosswise several times and shredded very finely 
with the rest of the cabbage. Either summer grown or fall 
cabbage may be used. Immediately pack into a barrel, 
keg or tub, which is perfectly clean, or into an earthenware 
crock holding four or five gallons. The smaller containers 
are recommended for household use. If a wooden container 
is used line bottom and sides with large outer leaves of 
cabbage as it is being filled. While packing distribute salt 
as uniformly as possible, using i pound of salt to 40 pounds 
of cabbage. Sprinkle a little salt in the container and put 
in a layer of three or four inches of shredded cabbage and 
pack down gently with a wooden potato "masher. Repeat 
with salt, cabbage and packing until the container is full or 
the shredded cabbage is all used. Press the cabbage down 
as tightly as possible and apply a cloth and then a glazed 
plate or a board which will go inside the container. If 
using a wooden cover select wood free from pitch, such as 
basswood. On top of this cover place stones or other 
weights (using flint or granite and avoiding the use of lime- 
stone or sandstone.) These weights serve to force the brine 
about the cover. 

Allow fermentation to proceed for 10 days or 2 weeks, 
if in a warm room. In the cellar or other cool place 3 to 5 



70 P. E. 0. COOK BOOK 

weeks may be required. Skim off the film which forms 
when fermentation starts, and repeat this daily if necessary 
to keep this film from becoming scum. When gas bubbles 
cease to arise, if the container is tapped, the fermentation 
is complete. If there is a scum it should be removed. As a 
final step pour melted paraffine over the brine until it forms 
a layer from i to ^ inch thick to prevent the formation of the 
scum which occurs if the weather is warm or the storage place 
is not well cooled. This is not necessary unless the kraut is 
to be kept a long time. The kraut may be used as soon as 
the bubbles cease to arise. If scum forms and remains the 
kraut will spoil. If desired kraut may be canned as soon as 
bubbles cease to rise. — U. S. Dept. of Agriculture. 

CAULIFLOWER 

This is a most delicious vegetable when properly cooked, 
and vile when improperly cooked, which generally means 
over-cooked. Remove all the large green leaves and cut off 
the stalk. Soak (head down) in a pan of cold water to 
which has been added i teaspoon of salt to each quart of 
water and a teaspoon of vinegar. Let soak an hour or more 
in order to draw out the insects hidden in the vegetable. 
Rinse, drain and put on to cook in a large stewpan, stem 
end down, and cover well with boiling water. Cook gently 
with the cover off the pan. A large head will require a full 
half hour, small heads from 20 to 25 minutes. The cauli- 
flower begins to deteriorate the minute it begins to be over- 
cooked. When tender drain, separate the flowerets. This 
is ready for seasoning.

GREEN CORN 

This most delicious of summer vegetables is frequently

GREENS FOR IRON 

The green leaves of spinach contain iron and vitamines. 
Their importance cannot be over-emphasized in the diet, 
by those who value health. So kindly do most stomachs 



76 P. E. 0. COOK BOOK 

take to them that greens are among the foods for invaHds 
and strained spinach water is the first food besides milk 
given to tiny babies. 

Take care in the cooking. Unless your family is trained, 
choose the mild-flavored greens, such as Swiss Chard. 
Always cook the greens in steam if you appreciate their food 
value, or boil them down until no water need be discarded. 
They should be watched carefully and when tender should 
be seasoned and eaten at once. The cook is often the cause 
for her family's dislike for greens. If they cook on, they 
develop a strong, disagreeable flavor instead of the delicate 
one they should have. 

Don't fail to teach the children to relish the green leaf 
vegetables, so valuable for their health-giving elements. 

Miss Wright, Home Adviser. 

GREENS 

The most common greens, both cultivated and wild, are 
as follows: Swiss chard, kale, Chinese cabbage leaves, water 
cress, endive, turnip tops, spinach, beet tops, dandelion, 
mustard, pepper cress, lamb's quarter, sour dock, smart 
weed, purslane, pokeweed sprouts, milkweed. 

SPINACH 

Spinach should be cut when young and tender. Care- 
fully pick over and wash in several waters to be sure that it 
is free from all sand. Put into kettle with \ cup boiling 
water, cover and let steam for 25 minutes. Remove cover 
and let cook down, turning often. Chop fine and reheat 
with salt, pepper and butter. Mound on a serving dish 
and garnish with hard boiled eggs.

SWISS CHARD 

When tender, chard may be cooked like spinach. If the 
midribs are large, strip the green leaves off and cook like 
spinach, but cook the ribs as asparagus. 

DANDELIONS 

Gather only the freshly grown plants; best when the dew 
is on them. The whole plant, after thorough washing, may 
be cooked till tender, drained, chopped fine, seasoned with 
salt, vinegar and a liberal amount of butter. Those who 
think it bitter may use half spinach or beet, or sorrel, in 
which case the dandelion should be partly cooked before the 
more succulent plant is added.

DUTCH LETTUCE 

W^ash carefully 2 heads of lettuce, separate the leaves and 
tear each leaf into about three pieces. Cut a quarter of a 
pound of ham or bacon into dice and fry until brown; while 
hot add 2 tablespoons of vinegar; beat one egg till light, add 
2 tablespoons of sour cream and stir into the ham. Stir 
this over the fire until it thickens and pour it while hot over 
the lettuce. Mix carefully with a fork and serve immediate- 
ly. Mrs. D. B. Harvey. 

TO KEEP LETTUCE FRESH 

Lettuce is useid principally uncooked, either by itself or 
in combination with other food as salads. To be palatable 



VEGETABLES 79 

It must be crisp and fresh. The best way to keep it fresh 
is to have a small pail with a tight lid. Put lettuce in the 
pail, sprinkle W'.^^h cold water, put the lid on tight and set 
in icebox. It may also be wrapped in paper. 

BOILED ONIONS

GREEN PEPPERS IN MEXICAN STYLE 

Put your green peppers on an iron plate and set over the 
fire, being careful not to burn; but they must be scorched; 
let them stand in cold water for an hour after the scorching 
and the outer skin will then peel off readily; split peppers 
up the side and remove the seeds. Make a batter of 2 eggs, 
a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of sweet cream, and flour 
enough to make a batter; dip each pepper in the batter and 
fry in boiling fat; they will fry a nice golden brown and 
should be eaten immediately. Mrs. G. T. Gaskins.

the parsnips will be of a creamy, light brown color. 

BOILED PEAS WITH BUTTER 

Put peas on to cook in boiling water. When water 
comes to a boil again, draw peas back where the water will 
bubble gently. Peas should always be boiled slowly, and 
with the cover partially off the pan. It is impossible to 
give the ex:act time of cooking this vegetable, since so much 
depends on the maturity of the peas, the length of time 
they have been picked, etc. Young, tender peas will 
generally cook in 20 or 30 minutes, and the seasoning should 
be added while they are still firm and crisp. If the peas are 
cooked until the green color is destroyed they are overdone 
and their delicate flavor is spoiled. Add i teaspoon of salt 
the last 15 minutes of cooking. There should be very little 
water left. Add 2 tablespoons of butter, and if the peas 
are not the sweet kind, add i teaspoon of sugar. Let sim- 
mer a little longer and serve.

DILL PICKLES 
Take nice large straight cucumbers. Long, green and 
white spine are good varieties to select for this purpose. 
Gather them when they have reached good size, but before 
the seeds begin to swell. Soak them over night in cold 
water, wash them thoroughly the next day, giving them a

scrubbing with a coarse brush, and pack them into a keg 
with alternate layers of fresh grape leaves and a few stalks 
of dill. Then pour a brine over them, made by dissolving 
I cup salt in one bucket water. Hold the pickles under the 
brine by weighting with a loose cover and stone. In warm 
weather the pickles will be good to use in 2 weeks time. No 
vinegar is needed, as the pickles will develop acidity enough 
to be palatable. Simply peel and cut them in slices length- 
wise and eat with potatoes, meat or even bread and butter. 
The dill is not absolutely necessary, but imparts some 
characteristic flavor to the pickles. Every seedman offers 
dill seed. A 5c packet is all you will want.

JELLY 

Fruit Juices Which Can Be Made into Jelly. 
Jelly can be made easily from the following fruit juices, 

since they contain pectin and acid in the correct proportion: 
Currant Gooseberry Blueberry 

Grape Cranberry Plum 

Sour apple Red raspberry Quince 

Crab apple Black raspberry Blackberry 

Jelly can be made from the following fruit juices only by 

the addition of an acid: 

Pear Peach Sweet apple 

Jelly can be made from the following fruit juices only by 

the addition of pectin: 

Rhubarb Pineapple Apricot 

Six Things to Remember When Making Jelly. 

1. Fruit juice must contain both pectin and acid, and 
contain them in the correct proportion. 

A. Fruit juice which is lacking in pectin may have 
the pectin supplied in the form of home-made 
or commercial pectin. This should be added in 
proportion of one to one. 

B. Fruit juice which is lacking in acid may have the 
acid supplied in the form of acid fruit juice. 

2. Fruit juice must be boiled down or concentrated to 
four-fifths its original volume before the sugar is added. 

3. An overdose of sugar is a fi-equent cause of jelly 
failure. Use less sugar by measure than fruit juice — not 
more than f cup to i cup of juice. 

4. Sugar should be added hot after the fruit juice has 
been concentrated. 

5. Jelly should be cooked rapidly, not simmered. 

6. The best results in jelly making are obtained when 
only two or three cups are boiled at a time.

CAKES 

CAKE HINTS 

Rich cakes need plenty of beating to fill the batter with 
air and make it light, but cakes that are mostly of beaten 
eggs, angel food and sponge, must be treated very lightly or 
the air held by the eggs will be liberated and the cake made 
tough. 

Cakes are guaranteed not to stick in tins that have had 
flour sprinkled over them after greasing thoroughly. This 
also improves the lower crust. 

Skimp the milk measure a little, beat a little hot water 
in just before making and notice improvement. 

Too many eggs harm, rather than help many cakes, by 
making them seem solid. 

Cake must be baked till done, determine by testing with 
clean broom splint; but to leave it in the oven longer is to 
shrink and toughen it.

CANDIES 

238° Soft ball. 

240° Medium ball. 

248° Hard ball. 

290° Small crack. 

310° Crack. 

350° Caramel. 

To test for soft ball, lift pan from fire, dip a spoon in cold 
water, then into the syrup, then into the cold water again. 
If it comes off in a soft ball, it is at the right stage. 

At soft ball stage, the ball will just keep in shape. 

To prevent crystallization, cook in covered pan until 
syrup is boiling. Crystals on the sides steam off. With 
milk mixtures, watch carefully and remove lid in time to 
prevent boiling over. 

In fondant making, do not scrape pan. The temperature 
of last few drops may be different enough to cause trouble. 

Smoother fudge may be obtained by pouring into another 
pan after taking from the fire. Do not scrape pan. Wait 
until a crust has formed before beating. 

Dipped candies keep well. 

Results are better if candy is made in clear, cold weather. 

FONDANT 

2 Cups granulated sugar, f cup water, | teaspoon cream 
of tartar. Stir until all is dissolved. W^ipe grains from 
sides of pan, cover and let boil without stirring. Try in cold 
water. When it has reached the right degree it can be 
gathered up between the fingers into a ball and will retain 
any shape pressed into, but must not be crisp. Pour very 
carefully on a deep, ungreased platter and let stand until 
cool. Stir constantly with large spoon or wooden paddle 
until it is too thick to stir, then gather quickly into the hands 
and knead as you would bread. It will become white and 
creamy-looking but must not be grainy. If you are making 
Christmas candies this can be made a week ahead and will be 
better for standing. Fondant is the foundation of all French

POTATO FONDANT 

Peel and boil a medium sized potato, mash and add pul- 
verized sugar until it can be molded. Flavor with different 
extracts and color with vegetable colorings. Put nuts on 
top or stufl^ dates with it. Mrs. Thos. D. Gregg. 

INSIDE FONDANT 

2 Cups sugar, \ cup boiling water and 2 tablespoons corn 
syrup. Put on to boil in covered saucepan. After it boils 
well remove lid and cook to soft ball stage. Pour in pyrex 
pie plate or shallow dish and set aside to cool. When sur- 
face is hard enough to retain a dent, beat hard until creamy. 
Use this for the inside of bonbons and chocolates. Mold 
the same day made. The corn syrup causes the inside to 
mellow and become soft. Mrs. T. L. Ozment, Jr. 

FONDANT 

2 Cups sugar, \ cup boiling water, J teaspoon cream of

This fondant will keep if put in air-tight container.

of milk, six eggs and six cans of peas to serve with them. 

Ham or Tongue to serve cold — Eight pounds. 

Ice Cream — Two gallons. 

Cakes — Four or six dozen individual ones. 

If strawberries are to be served with ice cream, provide 
seven quarts.

wiches. These may be cut again, making forty. 

Biscuits or Rolls — One hundred and fifty. 

Butter for Sandwiches, White Sauce, etc. — Five pounds.

Punch — Two gallons, four pints of carbonated water and 
two large pieces of ice. 

For seasoning and garnishing-^ wo bunches of parsley, 
six lemons, salt, pepper and paprika. 



VARNISH REMOVER— Three tablespoonsful of bak- 
ing soda in/rquart of water, applied with a rough cloth, will 
remove old var1^<?h very easily when you wish to revarnish 
furniture. 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS 209 

TO REMOVE SHINE— Sponge the serge with hot 
vinegar and then press on the wrong side of the material. 

SUNSHINE A CLEANSER— Sunshine is the best pos- 
sible disinfectant. The rays of the sun penetrate and dis- 
integrate all organic substances. Let it flood the rooms 
which are occupied whenever it is possible. Lay the bed- 
ding in its direct rays for an hour every bright morning. 
Dark corners that have a stufi^y smell are dangerous to the 
health of the household. 

SLICING LEMONS — Lemon slices should be separated 
when cut and not have a bit of skin that is uncut to hold 
them together. Seeds should be removed from the slices. 

FOR^ PANTRY SHELVES— Do away with papers on 
your pantry shelves by substituting for them two or three 
coatings of white enamel. The effect will appeal to house- 
keepers on account of its inviting and cleanly appearance 
aside from its sanitary qualities. 

TO DRIVE AWAY ANTS— For ants, put one table- 
spoonful of water and one tablespoonful of paregoric in a 
small saucer on the cupboard shelves or any place infested 
by them. They will all leave. Strips of blotting paper 
saturated with the paregoric placed on the refrigerator 
shelves will exterminate the little red ants. 

SERVING SARDINES— When a box of sardines is 
opened it should be drained of all oil possible and then the 
little fish turned out and sprinkled with lemon juice. They 
should be drained again before serving. The lemon will cut 
the remaining oil and make the sardines more palatable. 

A raw egg taken immediately will carry down a fish bone 
that cannot be gotten up from the throat. 

A mustard plaster made with the white of an egg will not 
leave a blister. 

The white of an egg beaten with loaf sugar and lemon 
relieves hoarseness. Take one teaspoonful each hour. 

TO WASH A WHITE SWEATER— Make a warm suds 
with any good laundry soap, and add to this a lump of sal 
soda or a teaspoonful of ammonia; either will tend to cut 



210 P. E. 0. COOK BOOK 

the grease in the wool, the presence of which makes the first 
washing of the heavy sweater so difficult. 

Do not rub garment on board, but wash by hand or in a 
washing machine until it is perfectly clean. Fold carefully, 
pass through wringer twice, and rinse thoroughly in clear 
water of same temperature as suds. Do not use bluing, for 
it will turn the natural creamy tint of the wool to a dingy 
gray. Again fold and pass through wringer twice, then 
spread out on a large bath towel. When towel becomes 
damp take a dry one and repeat the process until garment is 
dry. If the sweater is a new and heavy one, this may take 
two days. This method of drying gives the lustrous flat 
finish that the garment has when new, and while this may 
seem like considerable trouble, results are in proportion to 
the labor entailed. 

An egg added to a morning cup of coffee makes a good 
tonic. 

CURE FOR CORNS — Dip a soft linen rag in turpentine 
and wrap it around the toe on which the corn is; change 
this night and morning for a few days. The relief is instan- 
taneous and the corn will disappear. 

FOR THE PIANO— Place a small bag of unslacked lime 
inside the piano; it will keep the springs and metal from 
rusting. 

TO CURE BEE STINGS— A physician advises that the 
best remedy for bee stings is to apply oil of cinnamon with a 
small brush. It will slightly blister, but immediately draw 
out the poison. 

REMOVING GREASE— Eucalyptus oil will remove 
grease or oil from any fabric, no matter how delicate, and 
best results are obtained by gently sponging the soiled parts. 

CLEANING WALL PAPER— To remove grease spots 
from wall paper, dip a piece of flannel in spirits of wine and 
rub the spot very gently. 

FOR SEASICKNESS— Eating bread and butter which 
has been thickly sprinkled with cayenne pepper is recom- 



HOUSEHOLD HINTS 211 

mended by many physicians as an effective means of pre- 
venting seasickness. 

NEW USE FOR PARSLEY— If when making soups or 
stews you find the flavor of some one vegetable too strong, 
you can neutraHze it by adding a sprig or two of parsley. 

TO MAKE GLUE MOIST— Dried up glue can be made 
moist'and fit for use by the addition of a little vinegar. 

A VALUABLE CLEANSER— The juice of raw potatoes 
is excellent for removing stains from the hands and from 
woolen fabrics. 

TO MAKE CLOTHES WHITE— Placing a slice of 
lemon rind in the boiler when boiling clothes will help make 
them white. 

CURE FOR HICCOUGHS— A teaspoonful of sugar 
moistened with vinegar and eaten slowly will often stop 
hiccoughs. 

TO PREVENT SPATTERS OF FAT— To prevent lard 
or butter from spattering when eggs or potatoes are dropped 
in to fry, sift a little flour in the fat just before putting it on 
the stove. 

FOR IVY POISONING— One of the best remedies for 
ivy poisoning is to rub the afllicted parts with slices of raw 
onion. 

USES OF POTATO 

To Clean A Vinegar Cruet — Fill the cruet with finely 
chopped potato skin; cork tightly and let stand in a warm 
place three days. Then turn the skins out and rinse the 
cruet with warm water and borax. 

To Cleanse Rusty Knives — Use a raw potato dipped 
in brick dust. 

To Kindle Fires — Potato parings, dried in the oven, 
are good to kindle fires, as they light easily. 

To Clean Carpets — Grate a raw potato and rub over 
the surface of the carpet and finish off with a clean cloth, 
wrung out with warm water. 

To Clean Dresses — Grate two raw potatoes into a pint 
of cold water; strain through a sieve; add another pint of 



212 P. E. 0. COOK BOOK 

water and let it settle; then pour the clean part into a 
bottle. Dip a sponge into the water and rub the soiled 
garment carefully, afterward rinsing with clear water. 

To Clarify Drippings — Slice a raw potato into the fat 
while rendering. It will absorb all impurities. 

To Make Light Bread — Mash a boiled potato and add 
to the flour. 

For Corned Beef Hash — Chop a raw potato and add to 
the meat. 

To Cleanse Silk from Mud Spots — After washing 
thoroughly, rub soiled places with a raw potato. 

When a Fern Turns Yellow — Slice a raw potato and 
put it on top of the soil. This will draw out the worms. 

To Remove Paint from Windows — Use sal soda the 
same as you would Bon-Ami for cleaning them.
