LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL 



U. S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, 

OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 

Washington, D. C., October 12, 1895. 

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith, for publication as a Farmers' Bulletin, 
an article on the composition and cooking of meats, prepared under the immediate 
direction of Prof. W. 0. Atwater, special agent in charge of nutrition investigations, 
by Mr. Chas. D. Woods, vice-director of the Storrs (Conn.) Experiment Station, and 
attached to this Office as an expert for nutrition investigations. This bulletin sum- 
marizes the results of investigations regarding the nutritive value of different kinds 
of meat, and points out some of the things which should be considered in the cooking 
of meats for different purposes. The table appended to this article is based upon all 
the available data regarding the composition and fuel value of American meats (exclu- 
sive of fish), and is believed to be more complete than any similar table hitherto 
published. 

Respectfully, 

A. C. TRUE, 

Director. 
Hon. J. STERLING MORTON, 

Secretary.

MEATS: COMPOSITION AND COOKING. 



ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE FOODS COMPARED. 

The food of man can not be healthful and adequate unless it supplies 
the proper amount of the different nutritive ingredients, or "nutrients." 
Practical experience proves this, and experimental inquiry demonstrates 
it as well. Just what the functions of the different foods are their 
"nutritive value and cost" has been discussed in Bulletin No. 142 of 
this series, and a knowledge of the facts there set forth is necessary to 
a clear understanding of the present bulletin. 

/ It is natural to divide foods into two classes animal food and vege- 
table food. Not only is this division simple and convenient, as pointing 
out the two great sources of man's food, but the classification is a true 
one, for the difference between animal and vegetable food is very strik- 
ing in appearance, composition, and value in the economy of life. 
It is true that many of the chemical compounds which enter into the 
composition of these two classes of food are either alike or quite simi- 
lar; but in general the vegetable foods contain large amounts of carbo- 
h}^drates such as sugar, starch, woody fiber, etc. while the animal 
foods, and meat in particular, contain only small amounts of these 
carbohydrates. As regards the fats and nitrogenous matters or "pro- 
tein," the case is reversed; for vegetable foods have comparatively 
little of these two classes of nutrients, while meats have relatively 
very large amounts. 

The value of meats as food, therefore, depends on the presence of two 
classes of nutrients, protein and fat. The protein is essential for the 
construction and maintenance of the body. Both protein and fat yield 
muscular power and maintain the temperature. It is possible to com- 
bine the fat of animal foods with the protein so as to meet the require- 
ments of the body without waste, but the vegetable foods contain 
nutrients more especially adapted for the production of energy. 

284456 s 



Another difference between animal and vegetable foods is in their 
digestibility. The compounds contained in the animal foods are, of 
course, very much like those of our bodies, and therefore need but little 
change before they are ready for use. The vegetable compounds, on 
the other hand, require much greater changes before they can be assimi- 
lated. They are less readily and less completely digested than the 
animal foods. This is due in part to the fact that the nutrients of 
vegetable foods are often inclosed in cells with woody walls, which 
resist the action of the digestive fluids, and in part to the action of the 
woody fiber in irritating the lining of the intestine, and thus hastening 
the food through the intestine before the digestive juices have time to 
act thoroughly upon the food. Indeed, the presence of the woody fiber 
frequently prevents the complete digestion and absorption not only of 
the nutrients contained in the vegetable foods, but also of those con- 
tained in the animal foods eaten at the same time. 

STRUCTURE OF MEATS. 

In the sense in which the word is here used, meat consists of the 
muscular tissue, or lean, and the varying quantities of fat which are 
found in the different parts, as between and within membranes and ten- 
dons. Besides the fat ordinarily visible there is always present more 
or less of fat in particles too small to be readily distinguished from the 
lean which surrounds it. These particles can, however, be readily 
obtained by chemical methods in quantities sufficient to be seen and 
weighed. 

The lean part of meat has practically the same final structure regard- 
less of its kind and its muscular tissue. All muscular tissue is made 
up of prism shaped bundles, which can be divided into smaller and 
smaller bundles, until finally the muscle fibers or tubes are reached. 
These irregular tubes are so small that they are 'invisible to the unaided 
eye. They vary in diameter from ^ to ^^ of an inch. 

These muscle fibers or tubes are held together in bundles by means 
of connective tissue, and the invisible fat is stored between and inside 
the different fibers and bundles of fibers. Each of the bundles of 
muscle fibers, seen when a piece of meat is cut "across the grain," as 
in a round steak, is made up of hundreds of the muscle tubes. 

The envelope or wall of each tube is a very delicate, elastic mem- 
brane, composed of nitrogenous material. The walls themselves are 
quite permanent, but their contents are continual!} 7 undergoing change 
and renewal. 

COMPOSITION OF MEATS. 

As regards composition, the meats found in the markets consist of 
the lean or muscular tissue, connective tissue or gristle, fatty tissue, 

34 



5 

blood vessels, nerves, bone, etc. No general statement can be made 
with regard to the proportion in which these substances occur, as it is 
found to vary greatly with the kind of animal, with different "cuts" 
from the same animal, and with many other conditions. 

REFUSE, AS BONE, SKIN", ETC. 

Nearly all meats bought and sold in the markets contain some por- 
tions not suitable for eating, which may properly be designated as 
refuse. Some of these, as bone, contain some nutriment, and may be 
utilized to a greater or less extent in making soups, and perhaps in 
some other ways; but for the most part they are thrown away. 

It is important to distinguish between refuse and "waste." As the 
term is ordinarily used, any portion considered unsuitable for eating 
would be designated as refuse. At another time or under other con- 
ditions, it might be desirable to use for food the portion which was 
before considered useless. Such portions, therefore, are not refuse in 
the proper meaning of the term. They are waste. Some parts of 
meat, however, from their lack of nutrients or from the impossibility 
of preparing them for food, are and always will be useless, and these 
portions we may properly call refuse. As population increases there 
is, however, an increasing tendency to utilize portions of meats which 
have hitherto been thrown away. If our classification is to be a true 
one, therefore, we must narrow the use of the term "refuse" from its 
generally too-broad application and must cover much of its popular 
meaning by the term "waste." The skin of fish and poultry, "rind" 
of pork, case of sausages, etc., are illustrations of materials which 
might by one person be classed as refuse and by another be consid- 
ered edible and thus be classed as waste if they were rejected at the 
table. 

In ordinary meats the chief refuse is bone. The percentage of bone 
varies so greatly that no precise statement can be made. In many 
species of fish, bone constitutes more than one-half the dressed weight. 
In some cuts of meat, on the other hand, notably the round of beef, 
slice of ham, and similar cuts in other animals, there may not be more 
than 2 or 3 per cent of bone, and in still other cuts, as shoulder clod, 
there will be no bone at all. 

In general, the younger the animal the larger the relative proportion 
of bone, and with increase in fatness there is a relative decrease in the 
amount of bone. 

The following diagram shows graphically the variations in the refuse, 
chiefly bone, in different kinds and cuts of meats.

WATER. 

Meats contain large and varying amounts of water. For the pur- 
poses of mastication, swallowing, etc., of course this is better than if 
the meat were dry; but the water contained in flesh has no greater 
value as food than other water. From this it follows that the greater 
the amount of water in a given weight of food the less is its relative 
nutritive value, for it will contain a less quantity of nutritive material. 
Fish and oysters have relatively more water than most other meats. 
In general, the greater the amount of fat in a given cut the less is the 
amount of water. For instance, a lean cut of beef may have 75 per 
cent of water, while a fat cut from the same animal may not contain 
more than 50 per cent. 

The diagram on page 8 illustrates the variations in the quantity of 
water in the edible portions of different kinds and cuts of meats. 

FATS. 

All meats contain some fat, partly stored in quantities so large as to 
be readily seen, and partly distributed in such small particles that it is 
only by chemical means that it can be obtained in quantities sufficient 
to be appreciated. In the flesh of some animals, as cod and other 
white-meated fish, and in chicken (} T oung fowl), rabbit, and veal, there 
is little or no visible fat. In a very fat ox, on the other hand, one- 
fourth of the weight of meat may be visible fat, and, in the case of fat 
hogs, more than half the weight may be fat. No flesh is so lean as not 
to contain at least minute portions of fat. Very lean flesh, as dried 
beef, may not have more than 3 per cent of fat, while fat pork may 
contain more than 90 per cent. 

Fat is a valuable constituent of food. It is used in the body to form 
fatty tissue and is consumed as fuel, thus serving to maintain the 
animal temperature and to yield energy in the form of muscular and 
other power. It is the most concentrated form in which the fuel con- 
stituents of food are found. Its fuel value is two and one-fourth times 
that of protein or the carbohydrates. In other words, 1 pound of fat 
yields as much heat when burned as 2i pounds of carbohydrates, such 
as starch, sugar, etc. The fat of animal foods might be so supplied 
that, together with animal protein, all the needs of the body could be 
met. The fuel constituents of vegetable foods are, however, better 
adapted to furnish a large part of the energy required by the body. 

The diagram on page 9 illustrates the variations in the percentage 
of fats in the edible portions of different kinds and cuts of meats.

NITROGENOUS CONSTITUENTS (PROTEIN). 

There are a great many kinds of nitrogenous compounds in flesh, 
and an almost hopeless confusion exists in their classification and in 
the names assigned to the various classes by different chemists. 
Chemists are quite generally agreed, however, in designating the total 
nitrogenous substance as protein. These compounds containing nitro- 
gen may be arranged in the following three groups or classes: 

PROTEIN: 

Albuminoids, as albumen (white of eggs); casein (curd) of milk; myosin, the 

basis of muscle (lean meat) ; gluten of wheat, etc. 
Gelatinoids, as collogen of tendons and ossein of bones, which yield gelatin or 

glue, etc. 
Nitrogenous extractives. Meats and fish contain very small quantities of so-called 

extractives. They include creatin and allied compounds, sometimes called 

meat bases, and are the chief ingredients of beef tea and meat extract. 

The nitrogenous compounds of meats are made up chiefly of albumi- 
noids and gelatinoids. The albuminoids are so called because they 
resemble albumen or white of egg in their properties, and the gelati- 
noid substances are so named because of their similarity to gelatin. 
They are easily changed into gelatin by the action of hot water or 
steam, as in the manufacture of gelatin and glue from bones. 

The value of meats as food is chiefly due to the nitrogenous com- 
pounds which they contain, and of these the most valuable are the 
albuminoids. This is due to the fact that they are very similar in com- 
position to the nitrogenous compounds of the body, and are therefore 
easily digested and assimilated. Experiments with sheep, swine, dogs, 
and other animals seem to show that feeding rich, nitrogenous foods 
considerably increases the percentage of albuminoids in the flesh. 

Very different views have been held at different times as to the 
value of gelatin as a food. At one time it was considered nearly as 
valuable as the albuminoids themselves; but later, from the investiga- 
tions of the "French Gelatin Commission," it fell into disrepute and 
was held to have almost no food value. Later and better conducted 
experiments, however, have demonstrated that gelatin, when combined 
with albuminoids and extractives, has a very considerable nutritive 
value and serves to economize the albuminoids. 

The last class, known as nitrogenous extractives, or meat bases, are 
so called because of the ease with which they may be dissolved out 
(extracted) by water. They are formed by the decomposition (cleavage) 
of albuminoids and probably gelatinoids. They consist largely of 
creatin and creatinin, substances which somewhat resemble thein and 
caffein, the active principles of tea and coffee. They are of little 
value as food, but they give flavor to meats, and are therefore of great 
importance. They will be referred to again when we come to consider 
the flavor of meats, soups, and meat extracts. 

The lean of meat has, in round numbers, about 20 per cent of pro- 
tein, or, weight for weight, about five times as much as milk. The flesh 
at 



II 

of fowls, especially wild fowl, has on the average more protein than 
beef, and the flesh of fish has less. 

While protein is the most important and valuable ingredient of food, 
lean flesh is, nevertheless, a one-sided diet, and to make a well-balanced 
ration for man the addition of foods containing carbon, such as fat, 
starches, sugar, etc., is necessary. 

The diagram on page 12 illustrates the variations in protein in the 
edible portions of different kinds and cuts of meats. 

CARBOHYDRATES AND ASH. 

Although carbohydrates occur in considerable quantities in other 
foods, flesh contains but a small amount only a fraction of 1 per 
cent and that chiefly in the form of glycogen, or muscle sugar. In 
some of the organs, notably the liver, there are considerable quantities 
of glycogen. 

Meats also contain more or less of mineral matters (ash) which have 
value as food. The most important of these are the phosphates of 
potash, lime, and magnesia. These are used chiefly in the formation 
of bone. 

TEXTURE (TOUGHNESS) OF MEATS. 

Whether meats are tough or tender depends upon two things the 
character of the walls of the muscle tubes and the character of the 
connective tissues which bind the tubes and muscles together. In 
young and well-nourished animals the tube walls are thin and delicate, 
and the connective tissue is small in amount. As the animals grow 
older, or are made to work (and this is particularly true in the case of 
poorly nourished animals), the walls of the muscle tubes and the con- 
nective tissues become thick and hard. This is the reason why the 
flesh of young, well-fed animals is tender and easily masticated, while 
the flesh of old, hard-worked, or poorly fed animals is often so tough 
that prolonged boiling, or roasting, seems to have but little effect on it. 

After slaughtering, meats undergo marked changes in texture. These 
changes can be grouped under three classes or stages. In the first 
stage, when the meat is just slaughtered, the flesh is soft, juicy, and quite 
tender. In the next stage the flesh stiffens and the meat becomes 
hard and tough. This condition is known as rigor mortis and continues 
until the third stage, when the first changes of decomposition set in. 
In hot climates the meat is commonly eaten in either the first or second 
stage. In cold climates it is seldom eaten before the second stage, and 
generally, in order to lessen the toughness, it is allowed to enter the 
third stage, when it becomes soft and tender, and acquires added flavor. 
The softening is due in part to the formation of lactic acid, which acts 
upon the connective tissue. The same effect may be produced, though 
more rapidly, by macerating the meat with weak vinegar. Meat is 
sometimes made tender by cutting the flesh into thin slices and pound- 
ing it across the cut ends until the fibers are broken.

FLAVOR OF MEATS. 

The toughness or tenderness of meat, as has been stated above, is 
dependent upon the walls of the muscle tubes and the connective 
tissue. The flavor, however, depends largely upon the kinds and 
amounts of "nitrogenous extractives " which the tubes contain. Pork 
and mutton are deficient in extractives, and what flavor they possess 
is due largely to the fats contained in them. The flesh of birds and of 
most game is very rich in extractives/ which accounts ior its high 
flavor. In general the flavor of any particular meat is largely modified 
by the condition of the animal when slaughtered, and by its food, age, 
breed, etc. We have seen that the flesh of young animals is more 
tender, but it is also true that it is not so highly flavored as that from 
more mature animals. In most cases, also, the flesh of males is more 
highly flavored than that of females. There are two exceptions to this 
rule. The flesh of the goose is more highly flavored than that of the 
gander, and in the case of pork there is little difference between the 
flesh of the male and that of the female. Castration, as illustrated in 
the familiar example of the capon, makes the flesh more tender, fatter, 
and better flavored. 

With the exception of fish, the flesh of animals which feed exclu- 
sively upon fish or flesh has a strong, disagreeable taste, and is eaten 
only by uncivilized people or those in great need. As regards ordinary 
mat, however, it is enough to say that the nitrogenous extractives, and 
hence the flavor, depend mainly upon the age of the animal and the 
character of its food. 

Meat which is allowed to hang and ripen develops added flavors. In 
the first stages of decomposition compounds quite similar to the nitrog- 
enous extractives are formed, and it is to these that the added flavors 
are due. Game is sometimes allowed to hang until the decomposition 
changes have gone so far as to be offensive to one whose taste is not 
educated to enjoy the flavor of u high" meat. 

DIGESTIBILITY OF MEATS. 

We must remember that, as in the case of other foods, the value of 
meats does not depend entirely upon the amount of nutrients which 
they contain, but to some extent upon the amount of these nutrients 
which the body can digest and use for its support. Digestion proper 
consists of the changes which the food undergoes in the digestive tract, 
where the digestible portion is prepared to be taken up by the blood 
and lymph. These changes are chemical processes, and we can deter- 
mine quite readily by experiment how much of each nutrient will be 
digested, but this line of research is new and the methods are not yet 
perfect^ matured. 

Comparatively little attention has been given to the percentages of 
the different meats which are digested; but the facts so far obtained 

84 



14 

seem to indicate that flesh of all kinds, either raw or cooked, is quite 
completely digested by a healthy man. Rubner found that when given 
in quantities of not more than 2 pounds per day all but 3 per cent of 
the dry matter of roasted beef was digested by a healthy man. From 
other experiments roasted flesh seems to be rather more completely 
digested than either raw or boiled meat, but raw meat is more easily 
digested than cooked (boiled or roasted). 

A far larger number of experiments and observations have been 
made upon the digestive processes which pertain to the stomach than 
upon complete digestion. This is partly due to the hygienic importance 
of stomach digestion (for a large part of the digestive disorders occur 
in the stomach) and partly to the ease with which observations of 
stomach digestion can be made. Much is said about " ease of diges- 
tion," by which is usually meant the rapidity with which certain foods 
pass out of the stomach into the intestine, where the principal work 
of digestion actually takes place. Roast chicken and veal are tender, 
easily masticated, well flavored and appetizing, and, so far as the stomach 
or gastric digestion is concerned, are easily and rapidly digested. This 
agrees with the practice of using the so-called " white meats" in diets 
for the sick room. The rapidity of gastric digestion of this class of 
foods is due to the tenderness of the muscular tissues, and to the fact 
that this kind of meat contains almost no fat. Fat meats, as beef and 
mutton, are much less quickly passed out of the stomach, and gastric 
digestion in the case of fat pork is especially difficult. Although 
gastric digestion is important, it is by no means a measure of the 
digestibility of a food. 

The question of the digestibility of food in the broad sense is a very 
complex one, and there is much room for investigation in this field of 
research in learning the quantities of nutrients which are digested 
from different kinds of meats, in studying the effects of cooking, in 
determining the influence of different substances and conditions upon 
digestion, and in the study of numerous other questions. Until these 
investigations and experiments shall have been made, it will not be 
possible to affirm much more about the digestibility of meats than the 
simple but important statement that nearly all the protein and about 
95 per cent of the fats are digested by the average person. 

THE COOKING OF MEATS. 

Uncivilized man differs from civilized man in no more striking way 
than in the preparation of food. The former takes his nourishment as 
it is offered by nature; the latter prepares his food before eating, and 
in ways which are the more perfect the higher his culture. 

Meat is rarely eaten raw by civilized people. For the most part it is 
either roasted, stewed, fried, or boiled. Among the chief objects of 
cooking are the loosening and softening of the tissues, which facilitates 

84 



15 

digestion by exposing them more fully to the action of the digestive 
juices. Another important object is to kill parasites, and thus render 
harmless organisms that might otherwise expose the eater to great 
risks. Minor, but by no means unimportant, objects are the coagula- 
tion of the albumen and blood so as to render the meat more accepta- 
ble to the sight, and the development and improvement of the natural 
flavor, which is often accomplished in part by the addition of condi- 
ments. 

Flavoring materials and an agreeable appearance do not directly 
increase the thoroughness of digestion, but serve to stimulate the 
digestive organs to greater activity. As regards the actual amount 
digested, this stimulation is probably not of so great moment as is 
commonly supposed. Meat that has been extracted with water so as 
to be entirely tasteless has been found in actual experiment to be as 
quickly and completely digested as an equal weight of meat roasted in 
the usual way. 

In general, it is probably true that cooking diminishes the ease of 
digestion of most meats. Cooking certainly can not add to the amount 
of nutritive material in meat; and it may, as we shall see, remove con- 
siderable quantities of the nutrients. 

BOILING. 

If it is desired to heat the meat enough to kill parasites or bacteria ia 
the inner portions of the cut, the piece must be exposed to the action 
of heat for a long time. Ordinary methods of cooking are seldom 
sufficient. In a piece of meat weighing 10 pounds the temperature of 
the interior, after boiling four hours, was only 190 F. The inner tem- 
perature of meat when roasting has been observed to vary from 160 
to 200 F. , according to the size of the piece. In experiments upon the 
canning of meat it was found that when large and even small cans were 
kept for some time in a salt-water bath at a temperature considerably 
above the boiling point of water, the interior temperature of the meat 
rose to 208 in some cases and only 165 in others. Large cans of meat 
are more liable to have bad spots than smaller cans, because the heat 
in them is not sufficient to destroy the bacteria or other organisms that 
cause the meat to decompose. 

If meat is placed in cold water, part of the organic salts, the soluble 
albumen, and the extractives or flavoring matters will be dissolved out. 
At the same time small portions of lactic acid are formed, which act 
upon the meat and change some of the insoluble matters into materials 
which may also be dissolved out. The extent of this action and the 
quantity of materials which actually go into the solution depend upon 
three things the amount of surface exposed to the water, the tem- 
perature of the water, and the length of the time of the exposure. 
The smaller the pieces the longer the time, or the hotter the water the 



16 

richer will be the broth and the poorer the meat. If the water is 
heated gradually, more and more of the soluble materials are dissolved. 
At a temperature of about 134 F. the soluble albumen will begin to 
coagulate, and at 160 F. the dissolved albumen will rise as a brown- 
ish scum to the top, and the liquid will become clear. Upon heating 
still higher, the connective tissues begin to be changed into gelatin, 
and are partly dissolved out, while the insoluble albuminoids are 
coagulated. The longer the action of the hot water continues, the 
tougher and more tasteless the meat becomes, but the better the broth. 
Treated in this way flesh may lose over 40 per cent by weight. This 
loss is principally water, but from 5 to 8 per cent may be made up of 
the soluble albumen, gelatin, mineral matters, organic acids, muscle 
sugar, and flavoring materials. Part of the melted fat also goes into 
the broth. 

It would be a great mistake to assume that the nearly tasteless mass 
of fibers which is left undissolved by the water has no nutritive value. 
This tasteless material has been found to be as easily and completely 
digested as the same weight of ordinary roast. It contains nearly all 
the protein of the meat, and, if it is properly combined with vegeta- 
bles, salt, and flavoring materials, makes an agreeable as well as nutri- 
tive food. 

If a piece of meat is plunged into boiling water or very hot fat the 
albumen on the entire surface of the meat is quickly coagulated, and 
the enveloping crust thus formed resists the dissolving action of water 
and prevents the escape of the juices and flavoring matters. Thus 
cooked, the meat retains most of its flavoring matters and has the 
desired meaty taste. The resulting broth is correspondingly poor. 

The. foregoing statements will be of much help in the rational cook- 
ing of meats in water. The treatment depends largely upon what it is 
desired to do. It is impossible to make a rich broth and have a juicy, 
highly flavored piece of boiled meat at the same time. If the meat 
alone is to be used, the cooking in water should be as follows: Plunge 
the cut at once into a generous supply of boiling water and keep the 
water at the boiling point, or as near boiling as possible, for ten minutes, 
in order to coagulate the albumen and seal the pores of the meat; the 
coating thus formed will prevent the solvent action of the water and 
the escape of the soluble albumen and juices from the inner portions 
of the meat. But if the action of the boiling water should be contin- 
ued, the whole interior of the meat would, in time, be brought near the 
temperature of boiling water, and all the albumen would be coagulated 
and rendered hard. Instead of keeping the water at the boiling point 
(212 F.), therefore, the temperature should be allowed to fall to about 
180 F., when the meat could be thoroughly cooked without becoming 
hard. A longer time will be required for cooking meat in this way, 
but the albumen will not be firmly coagulated, and the flesh will be 

84 



17 

tender and juicy instead of tough and dry, as will be the case when 
the water is kept boiling, or nearly boiling, during the entire time of 
cooking. 

In boiling sections of delicate fish, as salmon, cod, or halibut, the 
plunging into boiling water is objectionable because the motion of the 
boiling water tends to break the fish into small pieces. Fish should be 
first put into water that is on the point of boiling. The water should 
be kept at this temperature for a few minutes and then allowed to fall 
to 180 F., as in the case of meats. 

STEWING. 

If both the broth and the meat are to be used, the process of cooking 
should be quite different from that outlined for boiling meat. Stewing 
is in this country a much undervalued method of cooking. This is 
probably due partly to the fact that stewing is generally very improp- 
erly done, and partly to the general aversion which Americans, con- 
sciously or unconsciously, have to "made dishes" of any kind. This 
aversion probably has its origin in a false notion which spurns economy 
or any attempt at economy in diet. 

In stewing, the meat should be cut into small pieces, so as to present 
relatively as large a surface as possible, and, instead of being quickly 
plunged into hot water, should be put into cold water in order that 
much of the juices and flavoring materials may be dissolved. The 
temperature should then be slowly raised until it reaches about 180 
F., where it should be kept for some hours. Treated in this way, the 
broth will be rich and the meat still tender and juicy. 

If the watej* is made much hotter than 180 F. the meat will be dry 
and fibrous. It is true that if a high temperature is maintained long 
enough the connective tissues will be changed to gelatin and partly 
dissolved away, and the meat will apparently be so tender that if 
touched with a fork it will fall to pieces. It will be discovered, how- 
ever, that no matter how easily the fibers come apart, they offer con- 
siderable resistance to mastication. The albumen and fibrin have 
become thoroughly coagulated, and while the fibers have separated 
from each other the prolonged boiling has only made them drier and 

firmer. 

BROTHS, SOUPS, MEAT EXTRACTS. 

The quantities of the ingredients in a meat broth may be illustrated 
by a German experiment. One pound of beef and 7 ounces of veal bones 
gave about a pint of strong broth or soup, which contained, by weight: 
Water, 95.2 percent; protein, 1.2 per cent; fat, 1.5 per cent; extract- 
ives, 1.8 per cent; and mineral matters, 0.3 per cent. 

Very palatable broths can be made by using more water and adding 
savory herbs. Broths thus made have, of course, a greater amount of 
water, frequently as much as 98 percent, or even more, and the nutrients 



18 

are correspondingly reduced in amount. It would appear from the 
analysis given above that the amount of solids in broths is generally 
small. Consequently their strong taste and stimulating effect upon the 
nervous system must be ascribed to the meat bases (flavoring matters) 
and to the salts of potash which they contain. Besides meat bases, 
soups contain more or less gelatin, varying directly with the quantity 
of bones used in the preparation. 

The term meat extract is commonly applied to a large number of 
preparations of very different character. They may be conveniently 
divided into three classes: (1) True meat extracts; (2) meat juice 
obtained by pressure and preserved, compounds which contain dried 
pulverized meat, and similar preparations; and (3) albumose or peptose 
preparations, commonly called predigested foods. 

The true meat extract, if pure, contains little else besides the flavor- 
ing matters of the meat from which it is prepared, together with such 
mineral salts as may be dissolved out. It should contain no gelatin 
or fat, and can not, from the way in which it is made, contain any 
albumen. It is, therefore, not a food at all, but a stimulant, and 
should be classed with tea, coffee, and other allied substances. It 
should never be administered to the sick except as directed by compe- 
tent medical advice. Its strong, meaty taste is deceptive, and the 
person depending upon it alone for food would certainly die of starvation. 
Such meat extracts are often found useful in the kitchen for flavoring- 
soups, sauces, etc. Broth and beef tea as prepared ordinarily in the 
household contain more or less protein, gelatin, and fat, and therefore 
are foods as well as stimulants. The proportion of water in such com- 
pounds is always very large. 

The preserved meat juice and similar preparations contain more or 
less protein, and therefore have some value as food. 

The third class of preparations is comparatively new. The better 
ones are really what they claim to be predigested foods. They con- 
tain the soluble albumoses (peptoses), etc., which are obtained from 
meat by artificial digestion. Their use should be regulated by com- 
petent medical advice. 

BOASTING. 

The principal difference between roasting and boiling is in the medium 
in which the meat is cooked. In boiling, the flesh to be cooked is sur- 
rounded by boiling water; in roasting, by hot air, although in roast- 
ing proper much of the heat comes to the joint as " radiant" heat. In 
both cases, if properly conducted, the fibers of the meats are cooked in 
their own juices. 

When the meat alone is to be eaten, either roasting, broiling, or fry- 
ing in deep fat is, when properly done, a more rational method than 
boiling, for the juices are very largely saved. The shrinkage in a roast 
of meat during cooking is chiefly due to a loss of water. At the same 



19 

time small amounts of carbon and nitrogen are driven off and a, little 
acid is produced which dissolves some of the constituents of the meat. 
The fat undergoes a partial decomposition into fatty acids and glycerin, 
and a little of it is volatilized. 

It is interesting and at the same time important to remember that 
the smaller the cut to be roasted the hotter should be the fire. An 
intensely hot fire coagulates the exterior and prevents the drying up 
of the meat juices. This method would not, however, be applicable 
to large cuts, because meats are poor conductors of heat, and a large 
piece of meat exposed to this intense heat would become burned and 
changed to charcoal on the exterior long before the heat could pene- 
trate to the interior. Hence the rule : The smaller the cut to be roasted, 
the higher the temperature to which it should be exposed. 

The broiling of a steak or a chop is done on exactly this principle. An 
intense heat should be applied to thoroughly coagulate the albumen 
and stop the pores, and thus prevent the escape of the juices. A steak 
exposed to an intense heat for ten minutes is thoroughly cooked, and 
has yet that rare, juicy appearance which is so desirable. 

CUTS OF MEAT. 

The methods of cutting sides of beef, veal, mutton, and pork into 
parts, and the terms used for the different "cuts," as these parts are 
commonly called, vary in different localities. The analyses here 
reported apply to cuts as indicated by the following diagrams. These 
show the positions of the different cuts, both in the live animal and 
in the dressed carcass as found in the markets. The lines of division 
between the different cuts will vary slightly, according to the usage of 
the local market, even where the general method of cutting is as here 
indicated. The names of the same cuts likewise vary in different parts 
of the country. 

CUTS OF BEEF. 

The general method of cutting up a side of beef is illustrated in 
fig. 1, which shows the relative position of the cuts in the animal and 
in a dressed side. The neck piece is frequently cut so as to include 
more of the chuck than is represented by the diagrams. The shoulder 
clod is usually cut without bone, while the shoulder (not indicated 
in diagram) would include more or less of the shoulder blade and 
of the upper -end of the fore shank. Shoulder steak is cut from the 
chuck. In many localities the plate is made to include all the parts 
of the forequarter designated on the diagrams as brisket, cross-ribs, 
plate and navel, and different portions of the plate, as thus cut, are 
spoken of as the " brisket end of plate" and "navel end of plate." 
This part of the animal is largely used for corning. The ribs are 



20 



frequently divided into first, second, and third cuts, the latter lying 
nearest the chuck and being slightly less desirable than the former. 
The chuck is sometimes subdivided in a similar manner the third cut

of the chuck being nearest the neck. The names applied to different 
portions of the loin vary considerably in different localities. The part 
nearest the ribs is freqently called "small end of loin" or "short 



34 



steak." The other end of the loin is called " hip sirloin" or " sirloin." 
Between the short and the sirloin is a portion quite generally called 
the " tenderloin," for the reason that the real tenderloin, the very tender 
strip of meat lying inside the loin, is found most fully developed in this 
cut. Porterhouse steak is a term most frequently applied to either the 
short steak or the tenderloin. It is not uncommon to find the flank 
cut so as to include more of the loin than is indicated- in the figures, in 
which case the upper portion is called " flank steak." The larger part 
of the flank is, however, very frequently corned, as is also the case with 
the rump. In some markets the rump is cut so as to include a portion 
of the loin, which is then sold as u rump steak." The portion of the 
round on the inside of the leg is regarded as more tender than that 
on the outside, and is frequently preferred to the latter. As the leg 
lies upon the butcher's table this inside of the round is usually on the 
upper, or top side, and is therefore called "top round." Occasionally 
the plate is called the " rattle." 

CUTS OF VEAL. 

The method of cutting up a side of veal differs considerably from 
that employed with beef. This is illustrated by fig. 2, which shows 
the relative position of the cuts in the animal and in a dressed side.

5. Breast. 10. Hind shank. 

FIG. 2. Diagrams of cuts of veal. 




The chuck is much smaller in proportion, and frequently no distinction 
is made between the chuck and the neck. The chuck is often cut so 
as to include a considerable of the portion here designated as shoulder, 
following more nearly the method adopted for subdividing beef. The 



22 



shoulder of veal as here indicated includes, besides the portion corre- 
sponding to the shoulder in beef, the larger part of what is here classed 
as chuck in the adult animal. The under part of the forequarter, 
corresponding to the plate in the beef, is often designated as breast in 
the veal. The part of the veal corresponding to the rump of beef is 
here included with the loin, but is often cut to form part of the leg. 
In many localities the fore and hind shanks of veal are called the 
"knuckles." 

CUTS OF LAMB AND MUTTON. 

Fig. 3 shows the relative position of the cuts in a dressed side of 
mutton or lamb and in a live animal. The cuts in a side of lamb and 
mutton number but six, three in each quarter. The chuck includes 
the ribs as far as the end of the shoulder blades, beyond which comes 
the loin. The flank is made to include all the under side of the animal. 
Some butchers, however, make a larger number of cuts in the fore- 





1. Neck.

3. Shoulder.

6. Leg.

quarter, including a portion of the cuts marked "loin" and "chuck" 
in fig. 3, to make a cut designated as "rib," and a portion of the 
"flank" and "shoulder" to make a cut designated as "brisket." The 
term "chops" is ordinarily used to designate portions of either the 
loin, ribs, chuck or shoulder, which are either cut or "chopped" by 
the butcher into pieces suitable for frying or broiling. The chuck 
and ribs are sometimes called the " rack." 



CTJTS OF PORK. 

The method of cutting up a side of pork differs considerably from 
that employed with other meats. A large portion of the carcass of a 
dressed pig consists of almost clear fat. This furnishes the cuts which 
are used for "salt pork" and bacon. Fig. 4 illustrates a common 
method of cutting up pork, showing the relative position of the cuts 
in the animal and in the dressed side. The cut designated as "back 
cut" is almost clear fat and is used for salting and pickling. The 
"middle cut" is the portion quite generally used for bacon and for 
"lean ends" salt pork. The belly is salted or pickled or may be made 
into sausages. 

Beneath the "back cut" are the ribs and loin, from which are 
obtained "spareribs," "chops," and roasting pieces, here designated by 




1. Head. 

2. Shoulder. 

3. Back. 

4. Middle cut.

7. Ribs. 

8. Loin. 



FIG. 4. Diagrams of cuts of pork. 

dotted lines. The hams and shoulders are more frequently cured, but 
are also sold fresh as pork "steak." The tenderloin proper is a com- 
paratively lean and very small strip of meat lying under the bones of 
the loin and usually weighing a fraction of a pound. Some fat is 
usually trimmed off from the hams and shoulders, which is called 
"ham and shoulder fat," and is often used for sausages, etc. What 
is called "leaf lard," at least in some localities, comes from the inside 
of the back. It is the kidney fat. 

As stated above, cuts as shown in the diagrams herewith correspond 
to those of which analyses are reported in the table beyond, but do 
not attempt to show the different methods of cutting followed in 
markets in different parts of the United States.

bin some cases the sum of the percentages of water, protein, fat, and ash in sausage does not make 
100. In such cases the difference is estimated as carbohydrates. There are. however, no tests show- 
ing the presence of these, and it may be more nearly correct to give no value for carbohydrates.
