HE favorite dishes 
of the Orient are 
rapidly b e c o ming 
favorite dishes of the 
Occident. This is 
especially true of the 
Chinese dishes. The 
glamour thrown 
about them by the 
mystery of their 
origin and the still 
greater mystery of 
the combinations 
used in their prepar- 
aration, adds a zest of which even 
the most skeptical is conscious. 

While this mystery causes a nat- 
ural hesitation on the part of the 
person who tastes for the first time, 
still when he has once tasted he 
is sure to taste again, and soon he, 
too, falls under the spell. He ack- 
nowledges that these Chinese 
dishes possess an intangible some- 




^«L,

thing which no other cooking can 
approach. Then he wonders how 
they are made. What ingredients 
are used. What sauces and spices 
enter into their make-up, and 
whether it is possible to prepare 
them in the home kitchen. 

It is for use in the home kitchen 
that this little volume has been 
compiled. Carefully — from the re- 
cipes given by Chinese cooks of 
great reputation — and clearly as 
possible — so the amateur cannot 
fail to meet with success — the best 
of the known methods of Chinese 
cookery are elaborated here. 

The charm of each dish depends 
in large measure upon the exact- 
ness with which the minutest 
detail is carried out. Exceeding 
care has been bestowed upon these 
details in each recipe printed. 
Each dish, when completed, can 
be served with the assurance that 
it will be perfect as if prepared 
by an experienced Chinese cook, 
provided not one detail has been 
slighted during the preparation.

ONE of the Chinese 
dishes permit of the 
substitution of strictly 
American ingredients, 
therefore no so-called 
Americanized recipes 
are given. American imitations 
lack the peculiar flavor which makes 
the chief charm of the Oriental 
cookery. 

The special ingredients used in 
the preparation of the Chinese 
dishes can be procured from the 
Chinese merchants and as these 
merchants are found in almost 
every city of any size in America, 
it is not a difficult matter to make 
the necessary purchases before be- 
ginning to experiment with the 
recipes. 

For the convenience of the read- 
ers of this book, a separate list of 
these ingredients is given, with 
complete information about each 
article.

Chinese Potatoes. 

A small Chinese vegetable which 
is the root or tuber of a water 
plant. The flavor is similar to 
sugar cane when raw. The chief 
charm about this vegetable when 
used in the different foods is, 
that it retains its crispness when 
cooked, and furnishes a distinct- 
ly delicate addition to any dish 
in which it enters. 
Chinese potatoes should be peel- 
ed and sliced thin. Their keep- 
ing qualities are not as good as 
of ordinary potatoes and they do 
not retain their flavor for a great 
length of time.

Chinese Ml^shrooms. 

A dark colored mushroom with a 
very different flavor from the 
varieties found in America. They 
are dried for the market and re- 
quire a few minutes boiling or 
steaming before being ready to 
use. 



^ 



Chinese Beans. 

A small green bean somewhat 
like a green pea in appearance. 
To prepare for use as sprouts, 
put the beans in a wire strainer 
with a flat bottom or in a stone 
crock with small holes drilled in 
the bottom. Set in a flat dish or 
pan and each morning for four 
or five days, cover with tepid 
water. At noon and night of 
each day cover wdth cold water. 
The sprouts will be large enough 
to use in four or five days, and 
will tak-e the place of celery in 
the Chop Sooy.

Chinese Seasoning Sauce. 

A rather salty sauce with a sort 
of meaty flavor. It is a neces- 
sity in preparing Chinese dishes 
to obtain the peculiar flavor 
which makes the chief chann of 
the dish.

Chinese Flavoring Sauce. 

A sauce which is somewhat like 
molasses in appearance and is 
used in most of the Chop Sooy 
dishes. These sauces are im- 
ported from China in jugs of 
a distinctive Chinese pattern.

^kerving a 
Luncheon 

or Dinner 




The ^Chinese method of serving 
, a meal is rather "topsy turvey" ac- 

Q cording to the estabhshed Ameri- 

can or European custom, because 
the Chinese serve the dessert first. 

A dinner served in the Chinese 
style would begin, for instance, 
with a dish of preserved Cum 
Quats, a dish of tiny Chinese rice 
cakes, a dish of shelled, blanched 
and salted Chinese almonds, and 
unlimited Chinese tea. 

The diners relax, converse, and 
leisurely enjoy the sweets, the nuts, 
the quantities of tea — thus prepar- 
ing for the heavier dishes which fol- 
low. 

The possibility for various ap- 
petizing combinations is unlimited, 
in serving the principal part of the 
meal, and the ingenuity of the cook 
will show to great advantage in 
planning out these combinations.

Chinese Methods 
o-p cooking Rice 

Rice is to the Chinaman what 
potatoes are to the Irishman, maca- 
roni to the Italian, and bread to the 
average American. Rice is the 
staple food; the one thing that is 
served always, no matter what the 
variety of other dishes may be. No 
meal is complete without the bowl 
of rice. 

The most important detail in 
the preparation and cooking of 
rice, according to the Chinese fash- 
ion, is the thorough washing of the 
rice as the preliminary step. A 
Chinaman M^ashes the rice in many 
waters, rubbing the rice mcII be- 
tween the hands in each water of 
the many u^ed, until it is entirely 
free from the white powdery sub- 
stance that gives the water a milky 
appearance. In other words, the 
rice is washed until the water re- 
mains perfectly clear. This is one 
of the secrets of the Chinese cook

and is the one ^reat reason why the 
grains of rice never cling together 
and present the sticky mass which 
is commonly the result of Ameri- 
can methods of cooking this cereal. 

When the rice has been thus 
thoroughly and vigorously washed, 
and all rice flovu* removed from it, 
it should be thrown into a good 
sized kettle in which a considerable 
quantitj^ of water is boiling rapid- 
ly. To quote from one Chinese 
cook, "Water boil him very fast, 
shake him too much so cannot 
burn." Allow this rapid boiling to 
continue for at least a quarter of an 
hour, or more. Take one kernel of 
rice from the kettle and rub be- 
tween the thumb and finger. If it 
rubs away easily, the rice is done; 
if not quite done boil a few minutes 
longer. Have a colander with fine 
holes set in a shallow pan. Pour 
the contents of the kettle into this 
colander and let the water drain 
off. Put the rice back into the 
kettle, pour over it a small cup of 
boiling water, cover the kettle 
tightly and set near, but not over 
the fire till time to serve.

Rice 



Wash the rice according to the 
previous directions. Put the rice 
in a kettle and pour over it suffi- 
cient boiling water to cover it at 
least two inches above the rice. 
Cover the kettle tightly so no steam 
can escape and set where it will 
keep very hot but not actually boil. 
From half to three-quarters of an 
hour will be necessary to allow for 
this method of cooking, and the rice 
when done, will be light, and the 
grains separated and white as 
flakes of snow.

^hop ^ooy 




Chop Sooy, in its various forms, 
is the foundation of three fourths 
of all the dishes served in the 
Chinese restaurants. With any 
one of the many forms of Chop 
Sooy, combined with other appetiz- 
ing ingredients and flavorings, the 
most delectable dishes can be 
evolved. Success in these combina- 
tions depends largely upon the in- 
genuity of the cook. 

{General directions for 
preparing. ) 

The Chinese Chop Sooy kettle 
is made of steel with a narrow 
rounded base and a flaring rim, 
and with small handles riveted on 
two sides of the rim. 

To make the best success of Chop 
Soov dishes, the kettle should be 



^ 



t9 



» 






t 



+■ 



^ 



similar in shape, being deeper 
directly in the center, and sloping 
up the sides to the rim. T?iis shaped 
kettle permits of the occasional ad- 
dition of the stock, or water, while 
the mixture is cooking, by pouring 
carefully around the sides of the 
kettle instead of over the top of 
the food. This is a very important 
detail in cooking Chop Sooy, as the 
best results are impossible unless 
this rule is strictly followed. A 
porcelain lined or granite kettle 
can be substituted for the regular 
Chinese kettle. A close fitting lid 
is essential. 

The uncooked meat is first put in 
the kettle with the heated oil, and 
braised till done, stirring occasion- 
ally to prevent burning. Olive oil, 
peanut oil, lard, butter or any pre- 
ferred medium can be used for this 
purpose. When the meat is sufii- 
ciently cooked the vegetables and 
other ingredients are added accord- 
ing to the directions. 

No stock should be added till the 
meat is brown and tender, and 



m

^% 



'«- 



f^ 



usually just before the vegetables 
are put in. A small quantity of 
stock can be added from time to 
time as needed, to prevent the mix- 
ture from cooking dry. Do not 
use too much stock at a time. 
Always have the stock heated be- 
fore using in the Chop Sooy. The 
same rule applies if water is used 
instead of stock. It should be hot 
when put in the kettle. 

There should be no apparent 
gravy when the Chop Sooy is 
ready to serve, — that is, no thin 
gravy; therefore, use the stock or 
water sparingly, a little at a time, 
just enough to give the right con- 
sistency. 

The sauces are frequently added 
just before the Chop Sooy is done, 
and the rice flour, wheat flour, or 
cornstarch, mixed with the sauce, 
for the purpose of thickening the 
gravy. A little ingenuity on the 
part of the cook will determine the 
right amount of gravy and thicken- 
ing. Chop Sooy should come from 
the kettle in a mass, without any

separation between the ingredients 
and the gravy, but should never be 
allowed to become stiff. Nothing 
but experience will determine the 
exact rule to follow. 

The Chinese Chef, as a rule, is 
apt to leave the vegetables a little 
under done, according to the taste 
of the average American palate. A 
few minutes more cooking is per- 
missible than the time called for 
in the directions, but in no instance 
must this time be prolonged till 
the vegetables are over-done, as 
that would spoil the dish entirely.

olive oil, butter or peanut oil, the 
latter being preferred. Cover 
tightly, removing the cover and 
stirring occasionally till cooked 
through and lightly browned. 
AVatch carefully to prevent burn- 
ing. Add one small cupful sliced 
onions and continue to cook for 
three or four minutes. Pour a 
cupful of hot chicken stock or 
water, carefully around the sides 
of the kettle, taking great care not 
to pour over the top of the food. 
Have ready six Chinese mush- 
rooms, which have previously been 
soaked, or steamed, and the stems 
removed, and cut them fine, six 
Chinese potatoes peeled and sliced

thin, two cupsfiil of celery sliced 
crosswise, and add immediately to 
the pork and onions. Put in one 
tablespoon of the Seasoning Sauce 
and mix well with the ingredients 
and cover the kettle tightly. T^et 
cook for twelve or fifteen minutes 
slowly, stirring occasionally to 
prevent sticking to bottom of ket- 
tle and burning. Add water or 
stock, as necessary, to prevent the 
mixture from becoming dry. When 
done the meat will be tender and 
the vegetables sufficiently cooked, 
but not over-done. Take two 
tablespoons of the Flavoring 
Sauce, mix with it a heaping tea- 
spoon of rice flour or corn starch 
and add to the ingredients in the 
kettle, allowing the gravy to 
thicken slowly. Add four drops of 
Sesamun Oil, stir carefully and re- 
move from the fire. Serve with 
rice in separate bowls and with tea.

minutes. Next roll over and over 
carefully into a long thin roll and

{Fried Noodles.) 



w 




Do not allow the noodles to be- 
come too dry after making. If 
too much time is needed, place 
noodles in ice box till ready. Put 
olive oil in pan having the oil 
about one inch deep when heated. 
Spread the noodles over bottom of 
pan and let frv slowly till a golden 
color. Then turn over with wide 
bladed knife or pancake turner 
and let fry on the other side till 
done. Perhaps ten minutes will 
be right, or fifteen. Remove 
noodles and drain carefully to re- 
move oil. Put on platter and serve 
with any one of the Chop Sooy 
dishes you prefer. The Chop 
Sooy must be ready and hot, and 
the noodles served immediately 
when done.

Chinese 

Cured Pork 

This pork is unlike any other 
cured meat and no American meat 
is found with a similar flavor. To 
cure, remove the fat from the pork, 
cut preferably from the shoulder 
of the pig, and cut into strips. Rub 
into the pork the Seasoning Sauce, 
and a little of the Flavoring Sauce. 
Then rub over it some good brandy 
and place in the oven. Mix a small 
cup of the two sauces, add a little 
brandy, and baste frequently till 
done. This cured pOrk is used for 
a garnish for many of the dishes, 
and is sliced in thin strips about 
two inches long.

Chinese 

Roast Pig 




Young sucking pig is always 
used for this roast, which is a 
favorite dish among the Chinese. 

The pig is carefully dressed, but ( ' 

is not stuffed, as is the usual case 
in England and America. It is 
rubbed inside and out with the 
Seasoning Sauce until the meat is 
well seasoned. Then it is rubbed 
with the finely ground imported 
spice, which is quite unlike our 
American spices, and hung on a 
spit over a clear wood fire. It is 
turned frequently and cooked 
slowly till brown and crisp. The 
flavor cannot be obtained by any 
other method of seasoning or 
cooking.

BoDcd Squab 




In preparing this dish, much 
time and patience are required, as 
the process of boning the squab is 
a very laborious one and requires 
great dexterity and delicate work. 
The squab should be opened down 
the back with a very sharp knife 
and the entire skeleton of the bird 
removed from the meat without 
breaking the skin. The ends of 
the wings, the legs and the neck 
are carefully tied and the back of 
the bird sewn up except one small 
opening where the small white 
mushrooms are inserted, being first 
coated with oil and a small portion 
of the powdered spice rubbed over 
them. The birds are placed in a 
pan and cooked in a hot oven,

being" frequently basted with a 
mixture of the Chinese Sauces. 
Twenty minutes is sufficient time 
to allow for cooking, but about 
two hours are necessary for the 
preparation. 

Boned chicken, or fowl of any 
kind, is prepared by a similar 
process. Dressinsj", or stuffing, as 
we understand and prepare it, is 
not known to the Chinese cook.

One cup fine cut white meat of 
cooked chicken; one small cup in- 
side stalk celery, minced very fine; 
one teaspoon finely shredded onion, 
two Chinese potatoes peeled and 
finely cut, all mixed together. 
Two eggs beaten light and spread 
over bottom of flat pan and cooked 
not too much, and cut in small 
strips. Mix with the other in- 
gredients. Have a pan with two 
tablespoons olive oil, very hot, put 
in all the ingredients spread over 
evenly and fry slowly till light 
brown. Turn with broad knife 
and fry on other side. Serve on 
platter with sauce made by mix- 
ing the two sauces and thickening

One of the most distinctive 
Chinese dishes, and one that is con- 
sidered a great delicacy, is com- 
posed of Shark's fins. The small 
dorsal fins of the hammerhead 
shark are used, and after being 
skinned are put through a process 
of pickling, somewhat similar to 
that given American pigs feet.

{Bird's Nest Soup.) 



w0mMmm 

This food is made from the nests 
of a certain variety of swallow 
which builds on the perpendicular 
cliffs facing the sea. The difficulty 
in procuring the nests makes them 
very expensive and none but the 
wealthy class in China can afford 
the dishes made from these nests. 
They are composed of a substance 
which is a combination of the sea 
\\ eed upon which the swallows feed 
and a secretion from certain 
glands of the bird, which when 
mixed with the food, forms the 
body of the nest. It is a glisten- 
ing white in appearance when the 
nests are fresh, of a transparent 
quality something like gelatine. 
The new and unused nests are of 
the greatest value, although the old 
nests, when thoroughly cleansed, 
are white and partially transpar- 
ent. The nests are dried for the 
market and sold bv the ounce.

To cook, soak in water all night, 
remove any trace of feathers 
which may be found and wash 
carefully in several waters. Allow 
two ounces of bird's nests for three 
bowls of soup. The Chinese Chef 
makes a stock by boiling a fat 
chicken in two quarts of water, or 
if a lean chicken, adds two small 
fat pork chops. Cook till a good 
rich stock is secured and season 
lightly. A small amount of onion 
is usually boiled with the chicken. 
Strain the stock and boil the 
soaked bird's nests in this stock for 
twenty minutes, when it is ready 
to serve. A little of the white meat 
of the chicken is usually served in 
each bowl, and must be cut in fine 
pieces.

The Chinese hUies, Lotus lillies 
and Bamboo, will answer for floral 
decorations, and these should be 
arranged singly in sprays, and tall ( ' 

branches of Bamboo in Chinese 
jars or vases. The Chinese never 
mass the flowers. 

Embroideries which carry out 
the dragon designs, or Chinese 
figures in the striking patterns 
usually found, are suitable; and 
especially artistic effects can be 
secured by arranging peacock 
feathers in tall vases. 

A large Chinese umbrella di- 
rectly over the table is advan- 
tageous, because the beautifully 
decorated lanterns can be sus- 
pended from the edges and from 
the center with good effect in 
lighting.

Yellows and reds are good colors 
to predominate. , 

No covers are used for the table. 
The place cards can be gay with 
tiny Mandarins, Chinese boys 
with umbrellas, and maidens with 
the inevitable fan held coyly in 
their hands. The lettering should 
run up and down the card in true 
Chinese fashion. 

A fresh pa^^er napkin is given 
with each course, and a different 
design should be selected for each 
set of napkins. The decorations 
are often exquisite on these articles 
and add greatly to the general 
effect of the table.

Small dishes of sweetmeats and 
nuts should be at each place, and 
a pair of dainty chopsticks, two 
tiny teacups and a sort of ladle in 
decorated china. A small pot of 
soy, see yu, or see gow, as the Sea- 
soning Sauce is variously called, 
should also be at each place for 
use if further seasoning of the food 
is desired. The ordinary Ameri- 
can method of supplying salt, pep- 
per, butter, etc., is not permissibe 
for the Chinese luncheon. 

The first course should include 
tea, which is served without cream 
but may be sweetened if desired 
according to the individual taste; 
preserved fruits, such as Cum 
Quats, Sar Lee, or any of the 
Chinese preserves ; crystallized 
ginger, nuts and rice cakes. The 
preserves are eaten from long, 
prong-like forks and these must 
be at each place.

The next course can be Bird's 
Nest soup with shredded chicken 
served in the queer little ladles. 
Boned duck fried with mushrooms 
and Chinese potatoes could follow. 
The next course must be a Chop 
Sooy made from any one of the 
recipes given, the one with lamb 
being very suitable, and this is fol- 
lowed with Eggs Fo Yong with 
Shrimp Yook, which would finish 
the menu. The serving of rice 
with the Chop Sooy is optional. 

These are merely suggestions 
which the hostess may vary accord- 
ing to her taste.
