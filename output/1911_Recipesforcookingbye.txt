it. Have the bread cut in even slices 
about one-half inch thick ; trim off the 
crust. The toaster will hold two large 
slices or four small slices at one time and 
will brown nicely on both sides in about 
one minute. 



The toaster can be used lor 1 5 
minutes at a cost of 1 y^ cents

on and when very hot put in the oysters 
and bacon. Just as soon as they begin

Coffee 

To make delicious coffee in the electric 
percolator, use one heaping tablespoon- 
fui of ground coffee to each cup of water, 
and one extra spoonful of coffee. For 
example, if you wish to make four break- 
fast cups of coffee put 4^^ cups of cold 
water in the electric percolator, and 5 J^ 
large tablespoonsful of ground coffee in 
the glass bowl. Turn the current on to 
full heat. It will begin to percolate as 
soon as the water boils, which requires 
about ten minutes. Allow it to continue 
to percolate for about eight minutes. 
It is a good plan to pour the first cup- 
ful back over the grounds although that 
is not necessary. 

To make 4 cups of coffee the electric per- 
colator will use 2 cents' worth of current 




-29] 



Use and Care of AppliancevS 

It a few rules are observed, electric heating ap- 
paratus will last for many years. 

Any apparatus having a heater attached should 
never be immersed in water — that is why for regular 
cooking it is best to have separate stoves with utensils 
to fit. The utensils can then be treated as ordinary 
cooking utensils. 

To keep the top of the stove clean and free from 
rust, clean it about once a week with vaseline. Rub 
a little vaseline over the top of the stove while it is 
warm ; then clean off with a dry cloth. This will 
keep the stove in perfect condition. This also 
applies to griddles and waffle irons. 

Never leave the current turned on when the 
apparatus is not in use. This is not only wasting 
current but shortens the life of the heater. When 
not in use, keep the apparatus in a dry place. 

If the devices used are connected to an electric 
lamp socket, always use the switch on the stove to 
regulate the heat or to turn the current on or off. 
If the article is not provided with a switch, dis- 
connect it by pulling out the attachment plug before 
you turn off the current. 

The electric coffee percolator can be kept sweet 
and clean by always using cold water ir. rinsing 
after it has been used. About once a week, the 
percolator should be filled with cold water ; then 
add about one tablespoonfiil of baking soda, put all 
parts of the percolator together as though you were 
making coffee, put on the stove and allow to boil 
hard for a few minutes. Then rinse with cold 
water. 

It is a simple thing to cook with electricity and 
the cost is surprisingly small.

The Electric Toaster 

Turn the current on the toaster ahout 
two minutes before you are ready to use 
it. Have the bread cut in even slices 
about one-half inch thick ; trim off the 
crust. The toaster will hold two large 
slices or four small slices at one time and 
will brown nicely on both sides in about 
one minute. 





Fried Oysters with Bacon 

24 large oysters 

24 thin slices of bacon 

Dry the oysters on a napkin and care- 
fully roll up each oyster in a slice of ba- 
con and fasten the ends with a wooden 
toothpick. 

Use only the blazer that fits on the 
six-inch electric stove. Turn the current 
on and when very hot put in the oysters 
and bacon. Just as soon as they begin 
to fry turn the current to medium heat 
and allow the oysters to cook until nicely 
browned on all sides. Serve with plain 
lettuce or watercress salad.

Coffee 

To make delicious coffee in the electric 
percolator, use one heaping tablespoon- 
ful of ground coffee to each cup of water, 
and one extra spoonful of coffee. For 
example, if you wish to make four break- 
fast cups of coffee put 4^ cups of cold 
water in the electric percolator, and 5^ 
large tablespoonsful of ground coffee in 
the glass bowl. Turn the current on to 
full heat. It will begin to percolate as 
soon as the water boils, which requires 
about ten minutes. Allow it to continue 
to percolate for about eight minutes. 
It is a good plan to pour the first cup- 
ful back over the grounds although that 
is not necessary. 

To make 4 cups of coffee the electric per- 
colator will use 2 cents' worth of current

Use and Care of Appliances 

li a few rules are observed, electric heating ap- 
paratus will last for many years. 

Any apparatus having a heater attached should 
never be immersed in water — that is why for regular 
cooking it is best to have separate stoves with utensils 
to fit. The utensils can then be treated as ordinary 
cooking utensils. 

To keep the top of the stove clean and free from 
rust, clean it about once a week with vaseline. Rub 
a little vaseline over the top of the stove while it is 
warm ; then clean off with a dry cloth. This will 
keep the stove in perfect condition. This also 
applies to griddles and waffle irons. 

Never leave the current turned on when the 
apparatus is not in use. This is not only wasting 
current but shortens the life of the heater. When 
not in use, keep the apparatus in a dry place. 

If the devices used are connected to an electric 
lamp socket, always use the switch on the stove to 
regulate the heat or to turn the current on or off. 
If the article is not provided with a switch, dis- 
connect it by pulling out the attachment plug before 
you turn off the current. 

The electric coffee percolator can be kept sweet 
and clean by always using cold water ir. rinsing 
after it has been used. About once a week, the 
percolator should be filled with cold water ; then 
add about one tablespoonful of baking soda, put all 
parts of the percolator together as though you wee 
making coffee, put on the stove and allow to boil 
hard for a few minutes. Then rinse with cold 
water. 

It is a simple thing to cook with electricity and 
the cost is surprisingly small.
