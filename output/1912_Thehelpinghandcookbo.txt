FOREWORD 

This Manual, prepared carefully by two experienced 
housemothers, is meant to be more than a list of menus 
for family use. There is a scheme — a "motif/' if 
you will — running through it from beginning to end. 

It would be wasting words to say that it is written 
especially for housekeepers of moderate means, whose 
earnest desire to set palatable and nourishing food be- 
fore those to whom they minister is often thwarted by 
the necessity of keeping table expenses within a certain 
limit. This necessity becomes a cruelty when our caterer 
has a just appreciation of the dignity of her task. If 
she be ambitious, she girds as one in bondage until she 
wrecks nerves and temper. If she be philosophical, 
and easy-natured, she settles into a groove of sameness 
that makes household duties a treadmill round. 

When she is obliged to buy second- and third-rates 
cuts, she makes no eifort to mask their commonness. 
Rice pudding is cheap. Therefore she has it for dessert 
three times a week. Lamb's livers cost less than beef- 
steak, and elderly fowds one-tli^rd less than young 
roasters. Ignorant, or forgetful of the redeeming fact 
that liver and fowls may be rendered toothsome and 
digestible, she serves them with all their imperfections 
on their backs. 

"Poor people can't be choosers !" is a parodied maxim 
often upon her tongue. 

One object of our book is to disprove the saying. 
Those for whom we have catered belong to what is 
known as the Mighty Middle Class of American com- 
mimities. The bone and sinew of our Republic, they 
are the makers of our Republic. Bearing in mind that 
a large percentage of them will attain (I do not say 



vi FOREWORD 

''rise !") unto wealth, in the course of time, we have 
tried to train the mistress of the modest establishment 
in comely conventions that may be practised as grace- 
fully in her present sphere as in that to which she may 
be called in later life. If the daily living of the family 
be held to approved lines, increase of riches and wider 
social responsibilities will not bring new and hard 
lessons. 

Bjelieving, as we do, that, next to excellent cookery, 
the most important element in "setting a good table," 
is agreeable variety of food, we have aimed to supply 
this with each returning season. 

Not the least valuable feature of our "motif" is the 
manipulation of "the fragments that remain" after the 
day's meals are served and eaten. To convert unlikely 
"left-overs" into palatable entrees, bearing so little re- 
semblance to the form under which they first appeared 
as not to be recognizable by the uninitiated eaters, is an 
art every frugal cook should acquire. 

The practice, or the neglect of this marks the differ- 
ence between true economy and wilful waste. 

Directions for the transformation of "scraps" into 
tempting fare are given each day. Recipes for dishes 
that may be unfamiliar to the average cook are included 
in the Appendix to the main body of the book. 

The whole is dedicated to the use of our sister house- 
keepers and homemakers with whom we have wrought 
cheerfully and with hope through a long term of what 
we would fain believe have not been unfruitful years.

Christine Terhune Herrick.

2 HELPING HAND COOK BOOK 

LUNCHEON 

Jellied tongue (a left-over), toasted Yorkshire pud- 
ding (a left-over), baked potatoes, brown bread 
spread with butter and cream cheese, ginger snaps 
and cocoa. 

DINNER 

Cauliflower soup (a left-over), larded beef a la 
mode (a left-over), fried oyster plant, baked maca- 
roni, brown betty, black coffee. 

From left-overs of yesterday's meals may be pre- 
pared dishes for Monday. The remnants of the jel- 
lied tongue may be served cold or the jelly may be 
melted and heated and serve as a gravy in which to 
warm the slices of tongue ; the Yorkshire pudding 
may be toasted and buttered. What remains of the 
cauliflower and the beef may also be used. 

Cauliflower Soup 

Put the pieces of the cauliflower over the fire in 
enough hot water to cover them and simmer until very 
soft. Rub them through a colander. Heat three 
cups of milk in a double boiler, adding a tiny pinch 
of soda. Thicken with a tablespoonful of flour 
rubbed smooth with one of butter and when the mix- 
ture is well blended add the puree of cauliflower. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper and at the last 
add a couple of tablespoonfuls of fried bread dice to 
the soup. Do this just as it goes into the tureen. 
Or you may pass the dice with the soup and let each 
help himself. 



JANUARY — FIRST WEEK 3 

Beef a la Mode 

IMake deep incisions in the round of beef left from 
yesterday. Care should have been taken in carving 
to slice it evenly so that it is a neat piece. Into the 
incisions thrust strips of fat salt pork which have 
been peppered. Make other cuts between those hold- 
ing the pork, and rub into these a forcemeat of bread 
crumbs seasoned with minced onion, sweet herbs, salt 
and pepper and a very little vinegar. If the skewers 
have been removed from the beef, replace them or bind 
it into shape with cords or a band of muslin. Lay 
the meat in the covered roaster and pour over it the 
gravy left from yesterday. If there is not enough 
of this add a little boiling water. Let the meat cook 
covered for an hour and a half, uncover and brown. 
Keep it hot while you thicken the gravy in the pan 
with browned flour, adding a dash of kitchen bouquet 
unless the seasoning is decided, pour the gravy over 
the meat in the dish and serve. SHce horizontally. 

TUESDAY 

BREAKFAST 
Evaporated peaches (stewed), puffed wheat and 
cream, finnan haddie, graham biscuits, toast, tea, 
coffee. 

LUNCHEON 
Yesterday's soup in cups (eke it out with a little 
hot milk, if necessary), fried brains (*), macaroni 
cut up and warmed with more cheese (a left-over), 



4 HELPING HAND COOK BOOK 

toasted graham biscuits left from breakfast, coffee 
cake, tea. 

DINNER 

Celery cream soup, calf's liver a la jardiniere (*), 
spinach, mashed potatoes, cottage pudding, black 
coffee. 

WEDNESDAY 

BREAKFAST 
Oranges, cream of wheat, bacon and fried apples, 
muffins, toast, tea, coffee. 

LUNCHEON 
Mince of beef and mashed potatoes (a left-over), 
fried mush, muffins saved from breakfast, sugar gin- 
gerbread and coffee. 

DINNER 

Spinach soup (a left-over), curried veal, boiled 
rice, stewed tomatoes, small mince pies, black coffee. 

Mince of Beef 

Instead of making a plain hash of your beef and 
potatoes, good though this may be, vary it by chop- 
ping your beef, seasoning it to taste with minced onion, 
■ — a very little, — sweet herbs and kitchen bouquet, 
and then putting it into a bake dish. Moisten 
the meat with the left-over gravy, spread the mashed 
potatoes into which you have beaten an egg and a 
little melted butter, salt and pepper to taste, over 
the top of the meat, cover it and put it into the 



JANUARY — FIRST WEEK 5 

oven until hot through, then uncover and brown. 
Serve promptly. 

Spinach Soup 

Heat three cups of milk to boiling, thicken with a 
tablespoonful of butter and flour rubbed together, 
warm the spinach and rub through a colander into 
the milk. Salt and pepper to taste, add a dash of 
nutmeg and serve smoking hot. If you can whip a 
few spoonfuls of cream to a froth and put a little 
of this on the top of each plate as it is served, you 
have a soup as pretty as it is good. 

THURSDAY 

BREAKFAST 
Malaga grapes, cornflakes and cream, bacon, boiled 
eggs, corn bread, toast, tea, coff^ee. 

LUNCHEON 
Yesterday's soup in cups, mince of liver and toma- 
toes on toast (a left-over), chicory salad, crackers 
and cheese, cookies and jam, tea. 

DINNER 
Mock turtle bean soup (*), beefsteak, creamed 
onions, stewed carrots, apple snow (*), black coff*ee. 

Mince of Liver and Tomatoes 

Cut the liver into small pieces, — this is better 
than chopping it, — warm it in the gravy left over 



6 HELPING HAND COOK BOOK 

from it. Heat the stewed tomatoes separately and 
if they are very thin, thicken them with crumbs. 
Put the heated chopped liver and gravy in the middle 
of the dish, — you may chop with it any of the vege- 
tables served around it yesterday, — and make a bor- 
der of the tomatoes. The toast under the meat may 
be lightly buttered, or you may substitute for it 
bread fried to a delicate brown in good dripping. 

FRIDAY 

BREAKFAST 
Stewed prunes, Petti John's breakfast food and 
cream, fishballs, popovers, toast, tea, coffee. 

LUNCHEON

chocolate.

oyster scallop, stuffed potatoes, stewed celery knobs, 
tapioca pudding, black coffee. 

Onion Soufffe 

Chop your cold onions fine, add to them one cupful 
of milk and two eggs beaten light, salt and pepper 
to taste. Turn into a buttered bake dish and bake 
in a steady oven. Serve at once, or the souffle will 
fall. 



JANUARY — FIRST WEEK 7 

Lettuce and Carrot Salad 

Cut the cold carrots into slices, arrange them on 
lettuce leaves and pour French dressing over them.

DINNER 

Canned green pea soup, breaded and baked pork 
chops, apple sauce, browned sweet potatoes, mashed 
turnips, custard pie, black coffee. 

Brown Stew of Beefsteak 

Cut the steak in small strips, brown a sliced onion 
in dripping; when this is done, lay in the meat and 
turn it over in the fat until it is lightly seared all 
over. Pour in a cupful of hot water, taking pains 
to pour it around the meat, not upon it, cover the 
saucepan and let all simmer together for half an hour 
or longer, if the steak is tough. It should be tender 
enough to fall to pieces when touched with a fork 
when it is ready to serve. If you wish, you can make 



8 HELPING HAND COOK BOOK 

cut dice or balls of potatoes, parboil them and let 
them stew for ten minutes in the gravy with the meat. 
Salt and pepper to taste.

sweet potatoes, coffee-jelly, black coffee. 

Veal Scallop 

Cut the veal into small pieces, — do not chop it, — 
arrange it in a pudding dish, making alternate layers 
of the meat and the stuffing, or if there is not enough 
of this, use bread crumbs seasoned with salt, pepper 
and powdered sweet herbs. Sprinkle salt and pep- 
per on each layer of the meat and dots of butter on 
each stratum of the crumbs or stuffing. Make the 
latter the top crust. Pour in gravy to moisten the 
whole thoroughly. If the gravy served with the roast 
has been used, make more of the bones and trimmings 



10 HELPING HAND COOK BOOK 

of the veal, or use a little stock. Bake the scallop 
covered for half an hour, uncover and brown. 



Potato Cakes 

Work a little more butter, pepper, salt and milk 
into yesterday's mashed potato, make it into cakes 
with the hands, roll in flour and fry in bacon or

the opinion of some friends of good eating.

Rice Croquettes 

Once I had an excellent cook who insisted that good 
croquettes could not be made of the cold rice left 
from the day before. There may be others of her 
opinion who will be glad to have the following direc- 
tion. 

Into a cup of cold boiled rice beat the well-whipped 
yolk of an egg, a teaspoonful of melted butter and 
one of sugar, half as much salt, and milk enough to 
soften the rice to a paste which may be handled. 
This may be made with floured hands into croquettes 
or balls, and after dipping these in the yolk of an 
egg and rolling in cracker crumbs, they may be put 
aside in a cool place for a couple of hours, to become 
firm, before frying them in deep fat. Take out with 
a split spoon and drain on brown paper in a hot

Is needed. Have a quarter cup of gelatine soaked 
and put with the chicken stock. When the gelatine 
is dissolved, take the stock from the fire and set aside 
to cool. 

Grease a plain or melon-shaped mold and when the 
stock begins to jelly, put a little of it in the bottom of 
the mold. Arrange in this sliced hard-boiled ogg, 
stoned olives and the chicken, cut into neat pieces and 
pour in more jelly. Repeat the layer of solids and 
then the jelly. If you wish you may use pistachio 
nuts or blanched almonds or walnuts with the meat. 
When the mold is filled set in a very cold place for 
several hours until the contents are firm enough to 
turn out without losing shape. Garnish with lettuce.

return this and the eggs to the rest of the soup, cook 
for two minutes and serve at once.

individual plates. 

Tom Thumb Omelets 
Make these in the same way as the timbales for 
which directions have just been given, but bake them 
in nappies or patt}'^ pans instead of in the timbale 
molds. When they are turned out on a flat dish pour 
a cream sauce over them. This is improved by the 
addition of a tablespoonful of grated cheese, stirred 
into the sauce just before it is taken from the fire.

by cooking together a tablespoonful, each, of butter 
and flour until they blend, adding a half pint of milk 
and stirring until you have a thick, smooth sauce. 
To this put a tablespoonful of grated cheese, stir 
until it melts and add a beaten egg, a drop at a

the timbales and serve immediately. 

Savory Omelet 

Beat six eggs enough to blend the yolks and whites, 
add a couple of tablespoonf uls of milk, a little salt

have melted a tablespoonful of butter. Shake the 
pan gently to keep the eggs from sticking and as the 
omelet cooks slip an omelet knife under it frequently 
to hold it free from the pan. 

Have ready a cup of hot gravy, rather thick and 
well seasoned. If you have minced giblets to put with 
it so much the better, or you may add to it cooked and 
chopped sausage. When the omelet is " set " and 
firm, slip it to the hot dish you have ready for it, 
pour part of your gravy over it, fold one-half of 
the omelet over the other and pour the rest of the

Egg Cups 
Boil eggs hard and throw into cold water. Re- 
move the shells and cut each egg in half, making 
two cups of the upper and lower halves of the whites. 
Rub the yolks to a paste with butter, salt and pepper 
and a little minced ham or tongue. If you have 
neither of these use anchovies or anchovy paste, and, 
lacking this, a little onion juice. Make balls of the 
paste, return these to the cups you have made of 
the whites, cut a little slice off the bottom of each 
so that it will stand ready, arrange on a dish and 
pour around them a cup of white sauce to which you 
have added a tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 
Serve very hot. If you wish you may adorn them 
with a sprig of parsley stuck on top of each ball. 

Fricasseed Eggs 
Boil six eggs hard and cut them into rather thick 
slices. Brown a little onion in a tablespoonful of 
butter, add a cupful of broth and simmer until the 
liquid is reduced and thickened. If it still seems too 
thin, stir in a teaspoonful of browned flour, wet up 
in a little cold water. Remove the onion, season the 
gravy with salt, pepper and a little kitchen bouquet 
or mushroom ketchup or Worcestershire sauce, lay 
the eggs in the gravy and let them become hot through. 
Do not permit the gravy to come to a boil after the 
eggs go in or it will break them. Serve with a 
garnish of toast or fried bread.

fuls of olive oil or of melted butter almost as slowly 
as if you were making mayonnaise. Wlien it is all 
in, add two tablespoonfuls of boiling water with the 
same deliberation. By this time the sauce should be 
very thick and smooth and may be taken from the 
fire, a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, salt and a 
little cayenne stirred into it and it may be put aside 
to get perfectly cold. This may be made long be- 
fore the fish is cooked, as it will keep two or three 
days in a cold place. 

Fried Shad Roes 
Drop the roes into boiling salted water and cook 
for ten minutes. Take them out and lay them in 
ice-cold water for ten minutes longer. Drain and 
put in a cold place until needed. Roll in flour, fry 
in shallow fat and either dress plentifully with butter 
or pass melted butter in which you have mixed minced 
parsley and let each eater help himself to it. 

Roe Herrings 

Wash these well and soak over night. In the morn- 
ing, lay in hot water for half an hour, then in cold 
water for ten minutes. Wipe dry, broil over coals 
or with a gas flame, dress with melted butter and 
lemon juice and serve. 

I have known persons who thought the over-night 
soaking detrimental to the best flavor of the fish, but 
it has its merits in taking out some of the extreme 
saltiness of the herring.

Rolled Braised Beefsteak 

Select a good round steak, have it pounded to a 
fair degi'ee of tenderness. Or you may use in tliis 
way a sirloin of whose quality you are in doubt, and 
have better results than by broiling. 

Lay the steak flat and spread it with a forcemeat 
of crumbs, a little salt pork minced, a fresh tomato 
or a quarter-cupful of the solid part of stewed to- 
mato, and pepper and sweet herbs in moderation. 
The pork should salt the mixture sufficiently. If you 
have a little left-over sausage this is a savory addi- 
tion to the forcemeat and may be used in place of 
the pork. Wlien the surface of the steak is spread 
with the forcemeat, roll it up as you would a sheet 
of music, with the forcemeat inside. Pin it with a 
skewer and tie it in shape with a cord. Lay the meat 
in a covered roaster, pour a cup of hot water or of 
stock around it, cover closely and cook at the rate of 
twenty minutes to the pound. Take out the meat, 
skim and thicken the gravy with browned flour, add 
a little kitchen bouquet for color and seasoning and 
after you have cut the strings and removed them 
from the steak pour the gravy around it. Leave the 
skewer in until the meat is carved.

ten minutes lower the heat a trifle and baste the loaf 
with butter and a little water. Your best plan is to 
melt a tablespoonful of butter in a cup of boiling 
water and use this for basting. Bake for about three- 
quarters of an hour, basting several times. 

Slip the loaf to a hot platter with the aid of a 
cake turner, taking pains not to break the loaf. To

Prcftaed Beef 
I>ard a round of cold roast heef with strips of salt 
pork, make incisions between tliem and rub into these 
a forcemeat of chopped pork, bread crumbs and sea- 
soning of pepper and sweet herbs, adding to these a 
little vinegar. Bind the beef in shape with a strip 
of cotton cloth, lay it in a broad pot with enough 
good stock to cover it, and simmer for an liour and a 
half. Let it get cold In the liquor, take It out, place 
a plate upon it with a flatiron or other heavy weight 
on top of this and let it stand several hours. All 
night is none too long. Slice it across and the beef 
will be well mottled and attractive to the eye as well 
as pleasing to the palate. 

Jellied Tongue 
Wash a smoked tongue and let it lie in cold water 
for several hours. Put it over the fire in a pot of 
cold water, bring slowly to the gentle boil, and sim- 
mer until it is so tender that you can pierce it with 
a fork. A large tongue will require three or four 
hours boiling. When it has cooled in the liquor in 
which it was boiled remove the skin, bcgimiing at the

root and stripping back, slice the tongue and arrange 
the slices in a mold. Pour over them aspic jelly to 
cover all. Make this by boiling a well-cracked 
knuckle of veal with a pound of chopped beef, ac- 
cording to the directions already given for the basis 
of Russian Soup. After you have cleared it add to 
two cups of the clear soup a half box of soaked 
gelatine. The soup should be hot when this goes in. 
Stir until dissolved, flavor with two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar and the same of sherry and pour over the 
tongue in the mold. Set aside in a cold place until 
perfectly firm, turn out and slice. If you wish you 
may add sliced hard-boiled eggs and stoned and sliced 
olives. 

LAMB

meat slips from the bones. Set it aside until perfectly 
cold, remove the fat from the top, cut the meat from 
the bones, fry a sliced onion until brown in a table- 
spoonful of butter, put in a heaping teaspoonful of 
curry powder and a tablespoonful of flour, stir until 
they bubble and then pour in two cupf uls of the liquor

Sheep's Head Breaded a/nd Baked 
Have the butcher prepare the head, scalding it 
and removing the wool, cleansing the mouth, etc., 
carefully. Soak the head one hour in cold salted 
water, then put over the fire in two quarts of boiling 
water and cook gently an hour, or until tender. 
Take it out without breaking or tearing it and lay 
in cold water for five minutes, wipe dry, put into a 
dripping pan, brush with beaten egg, strew thickly 
with crumbs, sprinkle with salt and pepper, cover, 
bake thirty minutes, uncover and brown, basting it 
with the liquor in which it was boiled. Keep hot 
while you thicken and season the gravy in the pan 
and send to table with the sheep's head. 

Kidneys Stewed With Wine 
Soak the kidneys in cold water, slice them, wipe

Mince of Kidneys 
Skin four pairs of kidneys, cut them up small and 
dredge them with flour. Put into a frying pan with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, a minced onion, and 
a cup of good brown stock or gravy. Simmer for 
ten minutes, keeping the pan covered, add a half 
teaspoonful of celery salt, the juice of a small lemon,

Slice lamb kidneys, remove the hard centers and 
lay them in a sauce made by beating together a table- 
spoonful of butter, a scant teaspoonful of dry mus- 
tard, a pinch of paprika, a lialf teaspoonful of salt 
and a teaspoonful of lemon juice; soften the mixture 
to a cream. When the kidneys are well coated with 
this, roll them in cracker dust and ijroil over a clear 
fire for ai)out eight minutes. Put the rest of the 
sauce with them when they go to table. 



EECIPES 273 

Kidney Pie 
After cutting two pairs of kidneys into dice put 
them over the fire in a Httle weak stock and stew them 
gently for half an hour. While they are cooking, 
break a quarter of a pound of macaroni or spaghetti 
into inch-lengths and boil it until tender. Drain it, 
place a layer of it in the bottom of a buttered bake- 
dish, spread over it a layer of the kidneys, seasoned 
with pepper, salt and a little Worcestershire sauce. 
On top of them arrange a layer of stewed tomatoes 
and then more macaroni, repeating these layers until 
the dish is filled. Make the top layer macaroni and 
sprinkle cheese thickly over it. Make a good gravy 
of the stock in which the kidneys were cooked, season 
it well and pour this into the dish before the cheese 
is put on. Bake for half an hour, covered, uncover 
and brown. 



VEAL 

Veal Cutlets, Breaded 
Pepper and salt veal cutlets, cutting them into

There should be two cupfuls of the carrots to two 
pounds of the meat and they may be taken out of 
the gravy at the same time as the meat and arranged 
around it in the dish to keep hot while the dumplings 
are cooking. 

Curried Veal 

If fresh veal is used for this, an onion should be 
fried in a little dripping, and when this is brown, 
the veal, cut into neat pieces for stewing, should be 
laid in the fat and browned for five minutes. Two 
cupfuls of hot water may then be poured around it 
— not upon it, — the saucepan covered and the meat 
left to stew until tender. When this point is nearly 
reached, two teaspoonfuls of curry powder wet up with 
cold water should be added to the gravy with a little 
salt and the juice of a lemon, and all should be al- 
lowed to simmer together for twenty minutes. The 
gravy may then be thickened a very little and the 
curry served with boiled rice as a border or in a 
separate dish. 

Directions for making curry from cooked meat will 
be found elsewhere. 

Jellied Veal 
Boil two pounds of lean veal in enough cold water 
to cover it and let it get cold in the liquor in which 
it was stewed. Then skim the grease from the top,

Have a butcher cut vou a veal steak about an inch 
thick. Flatten this with the broad side of a hatchet, 
squeeze a few drops of lemon juice upon it and 
spread it with a forcemeat made of chopped ham 
and well-seasoned bread crumbs. Roll the meat with 
the forcemeat on the inside and tie it in shape with 
a soft string. Lay it in a dripping pan and pour 
around it two cupfuls of boiling water. Turn a pan 
over this, or if you use a covered roaster, close the 
top, and bake nearly two hours, basting with the 
gravy frequently. ^Vhcn done remove the meat to a 
hot dish and take off the strings; thicken the gravy 
Avith browned flour and season well with pepper, salt, 
onion juice and tomato catsup. Boil up, stirring 
until the gravy is thick and pour over the meat in 
the dish. 



RECIPES 277 

Veal and Ham Loaf 
Stew a pound of lean veal until tender, chop it fine 
and put with it a quarter of a pound of cold boiled 
ham, minced. Boil down the liquor in which the veal 
was cooked to about half a cupful, add to it the 
juice of half a lemon, pepper and salt to taste and 
a pinch of mace. Mix the minced meat with the 
gravy and press hard into a buttered mold or bowl, 
put a weighted plate on top of the meat and set aside 
over night. The next day j^ou can turn it out in 
a loaf and cut this in neat slices. 

Galantine 
Have a breast of veal boned and trim it neatly. 
Butter the inside and spread Avith forcemeat made of 
a cupful of cold-boiled tongue or ham chopped fine, 
a half cupful of minced mushrooms, a half cupful 
of bread crumbs, all seasoned with salt, pepper, a 
little lemon juice and moistened with a couple of 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter. After you have 
covered the meat with this mixture stick into it here 
and there almonds, blanched and sliced, — about 
twenty in all, — a dozen olives, stoned and sliced and 
if you can get them, a few green pistachio nuts. Roll 
up the meat with the stuffing inside and sew it in a 
piece of cheesecloth, to keep the roll in shape. Put 
it into a saucepan with enough weak stock to cover it, 
adding to this a sliced onion and carrot, a stalk of 
celery, one of parsley and a bunch of soup herbs, and

Calf's Head, Plain 
Have a calf's head thoroughly cleansed by the 
butcher, leaving the skin on. Take out and pai:boiI 
the brains and tongue and after parboiling, blanch 
them by throwing them in cold water for ten minutes. 
Put the head over the tire in enough cold water to 
cover it, bring this quickly to a boil, remove the head 
and lay in iced water. When entirely cold take out 
the head, brush it over with vinegar and return it 
to the pot with enough boiling water to cover it well, 
adding to this two tablcspoonfuls of vinegar, a sliced 
onion and carrot, a tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
six black peppers, whole, and a dessertspoonful of 
salt. Cook gently until the meat will slip from the 
bones. Two hours will be required for a small head. 
Take from the water, remove the bones without break- 
ing the flesh seriously, rub the head with butter, strew 
over It peppered and salted crumbs and brown in the 
oven.

make incisions in it with a long, narrow-bladed knife 
and into these thrust strips of fat salt pork. The 
slits should run through the liver from top to bot- 
tom and be about an inch apart. Cover the bottom 
of a baking dish with chopped salt pork, place the 
liver on it with a chopped carrot, onion and a couple 
of stalks of celery, the juice of a lemon and enough 
stock nearly to cover the liver. Cover the pan, bake 
the liver for two hours, basting often, uncover and 
brown. Transfer to a hot dish, tliicken and further 
season the gravy left in the pan and pour over the

PORK 



Chine of Pork, Braised With Apple Sauce 
Have the chine cut with as much meat as prac- 
ticable on both sides of the bone, sprinkle it with 
pepper and salt, with sage and thyme. Lay on the 
grating of the covered roaster three large tart apples, 
peeled, cored and sliced, strew sugar over them and 
lay the pork upon them, dotting it with bits of but- 
ter. Cover and roast the pork twenty-five minutes 
to the pound ; then remove the meat and lay it in a 
dripping pan with the side uppermost which has been 
downwards until now. Rub it with butter, strew 
thickly with crumbs and brown. Make a gravy by 
putting the apples and drippings from the baking 
pan through a colander, thicken this with a table- 
spoonful of flour rubbed smooth with one of butter,

Ihikfd lircad and Cheese 
Cut slices of moderately stale bread about half an 
inch thick, trimminfr off tiie crust and arranfje it in 
a pudding dish, laying on each slice of bread one 
of American cheese, about an ei/:jhth of an incii thick. 
Sprinkle the layers with a little salt, pour over them 
enough milk to fill the dish full, set it in the oven,

Baked Welsh Rabbit 
Prepare exactly as in the preceding recipe but add 
a beaten egg to a cup of hot milk, and when the 
bread and cheese have baked for twenty minutes add 
the hot milk and egg to the dish and bake for ten 
minutes longer. Either dish is simple, appetizing and 
nourishing. 

Fried Bread and Cheese 
Cut thin slices of American cheese and lay a slice 
of cheese between two thicknesses of bread, cut about 
half an inch thick. If they do not stay together 
otherwise, pin them with small wooden toothpicks, 
which can be removed before the dish is sened. Lay 
these slices in hot butter and fry to a good l)rown. 
They are extremely toothsome and not especially di- 
gestible.

RECIPES 311 

Tomato Aspic on Lettuce 
Strain a pint of tomato liquor from canned or 
stewed tomatoes, put it over the fire with a sliced 
onion, a bay leaf, a sprig of parsley and a little salt 
and stew fifteen minutes. Soak a half-box of gelatine 
soft in a cupful of water and then add to the hot 
tomato juice, stirring until the gelatine dissolves. 
Take the tomato juice from the fire, strain it, add 
to it a tablespoonful of vinegar and set it to cool 
in small cups or timbale molds rinsed out with cold 
water. When the jelly is firm, as it should be in 
the course of a few hours if kept on the ice, turn out 
the forms on lettuce leaves and serve with a Frencli 
or mayonnaise dressing. 

Tomato and Cucumber Salad 
Peel firai tomatoes with care, taking pains not to 

break the outer walls, scoop out the pulp and fill 

the tomato baskets with cucumber dice. Serve with 

a French or maj'^onnaise dressing. 

Or you may peel the tomatoes, cut them into cubes, 

mix with the cucumber dice and serve on lettuce leaves 

with a French dressing.

French Dressing 
Three tablespoonfuls of salad oil (unless you arc 
a genuine oil-lover, in which case use four), one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, u saltspoonful of salt, half a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Rub a little garlic on the 
bowl of the spoon or the inside of the bowl in wliich 
the dressing is mixed. Dissolve the salt and pepper 
in the vinegar, stir in the oil. Put it in a very cold 
bowl and have oil and vinegar both chilled. A good 
addition is a small lump of ice stirred with the dress- 



RECIPES 313 

ing and taken out as soon as it is mixed. Three 
or four minutes stirring is required to make the oil 
and vinegar blend properly. 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

One pint of salad oil, one tablespoonful of vinegar, 
one Qgg^ juice of half a lemon, saltspoonful of salt, 
half a saltspoonful of white pepper and tlie same of 
dry mustard. Separate the white and yolk of an 
egg, put the salt, pepper, mustard and lemon juice 
with the yolk and begin stirring in the oil a drop 
at a time. In a few minutes increase to two or three 
drops and as the oil and egg blend and begin to 
thicken increase the quantity of oil at a dropping, 
until finally you are putting it in a teaspoonful at a 
time. Stir in each addition thoroughly before you 
proceed to another. When the dressing becomes too 
thick to stir easil}^ add some of the vinegar. The 
stirring with the fork should be unremitting. Just 
before the dressing is to be used beat the white of the 
egg to a standing froth and add to it. 

This business of mixing a mayonnaise is very simple 
and easy if the utensils and ingredients are all very 
cold. Keep them on the ice for a couple of hours 
before they are needed. 

Should the dressing curdle, set it to one side, take 
another egg yolk and start the process from the be- 
ginning. When the second lot is well-thickened the 
curdled portion may be stirred into it without injury 
to the quality of the mayonnaise. 



DESSERTS AND CAKES 

Apple Snow 
Make a custard hj' stirring into two cups of hot 
milk the yolks of three eggs, the wliitc of one and 
half a cup of powdered sugar. Continue the stirring 
until the custard thickens and set it aside to cool. 
Whip the whites of the other two eggs to a meringue 
with half a cup of powdered sugar and grate into 
this six firm apples, which you Imve first T)eeled. 
This should not be done until just before the dish is 
to be sei-Acd, as the apples change color and darken 
very quickly. When you have mixed the meringue 
and the grated apples, put the cold custard in the 
bottom of a glass dish and heap on it by spoonfuls 
the apple meringue or " snow." All the ingredients 
of the meringue should have been on the ice for at 
least an hour before they are put together and the 
custard should be thoroughly chilled. 

Apple Batter FudiVing 
Make a batter by mixing four well-beaten eggs 
with a quart of milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter and three cupfuls of flour which you have 
sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a 
saltspoonful of salt. Butter the inside of a deep 
pudding dish, lay in eight apples, which have been

pared, cored and quartered. Sprinkle sugar thickly 
over them, distribute a dozen whole cloves among them 
and pour over them the batter. Cover, bake in a 
steady oven for half an hour, uncover and brown. 
Serve a hard sauce with this pudding. 

Apple Shortcake 
Rub two tablespoonfuls of butter or mixed butter 
and lard into four cupfuls of flour which you have 
sifted with two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and 
half a teaspoonful of salt and work to a soft dough 
with two cupfuls of milk. Roll this into a sheet half 
an inch thick, cut part of it to fit the bottom of a 
greased baking tin, lay over this a thick layer of 
cored, peeled and sliced apples, strew these with half 
a cupful of sugar, lay the remainder of the dough 
over these in a thin sheet and bake in a steady oven 
for half an hour. Cut into squares or triangles and 
serve with hard sauce or with butter and sugar. 

Szenss Toast With Lemon Sauce 
Cut rounds of stale bread about an inch thick, 
make an eggless custard with a pint of milk, two 
beaten eggs and a pinch of salt; lay the rounds in 
this and let them absorb the raw custard for half 
an hour, turning them over once and being careful 
not to break them. Take the rounds up with a cake- 
turner and slip them into boiling deep fat. They 
will take about five minutes to cook. Serve them 
with a lemon sauce made by working a tablespoonful 
of butter into a cupful of sugar and adding a table-

malade is especially good for this. Arrange the 
bread and mamialadc in layers in a deep-buttered 
pudding dish and pour over each layer a hat custard, 
made by heating four cups of milk over the fire and 
stirring into it four tablespoonfuls of sugar and four 
beaten eggs, cooking this for only one minute after it 
is scalding hot. Allow each layer to absorb as nuich 
of the custard as it will take up before you proceed 
to tlie next. When all the materials are used, cover 
the dish, bake half an hour, uncover and brown and 
eat hot with such lemon sauce as is made for Swiss 
toast. Or ^-ou ma}^ let the dish become very cold 
and eat with cream. 

Bread-and-Raisin Pudding 
Soak two even cups of bread crumbs in three cups 
of hot milk for half an hour. Cream together a 
tablespoonful of butter and half a cupful of sugar; 
beat three eggs light and put with them butter and 
sugar. Butter a pudding dish and after stirring the 
crumbs and milk to a smooth paste, spread a layer 
of it in the bottom of a pudding dish ; strew with 
seeded raisins, — you will need a generous half cupful 
for the dish — and Avith a little mixed nutmeg and 
cinnamon. Put on another lavcr of the crumbs, more

the oven and let it get heated through. Pour over 
it the butter, sugar and egg mixture, cover, bake 
twenty minutes, uncover and brown. Eat with cream. 

Bread-cmd-Jom Pudding 
Cover the bottom of a greased pudding dish an 
inch deep with bread crumbs. Make a hot custard 
of a quart of milk, four tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
four eggs, as directed in the recipe for Bread-and- 
Marmalade Pudding and pour in as much of this as 
the crumbs will soak up. Cover the crumbs with a 
half inch layer of any good jam, — raspberry, peach, 
strawberry, whatever you happen to have — put on 
this another inch-thickness of the crumbs and pour 
on the rest of the custard, slowly, that it may absorb 
well. Cover and bake half an hour before you permit 
it to brown. Eat very cold with cream. 

Queen's Toast 
Cut rounds of stale bread, removing the crust, and 
fry in butter or sweet dripping or lard to a light 
brown. As you take each slice from the pan dip it 
for a second into boiling water. It should be merely 
a dip, no more. Sprinkle thickly with cinnamon and 
sugar or with jam and serve with hard sauce or with 
cream. Keep the toast very hot.

Prime-and-Nut Jelly 
Soak two-thirds of a box of gelatine for two hours 
in a cupful of cold water, add a cupful of boiling 
water and three cupfuls of water in which a cupful 
of prunes has stewed for several hours. To this a 
cupful of sugar should have been added before the 
prunes were removed. Stir the jelly over the fire 
until clear, strain, add the juice of a lemon and two 
tablespoonfuls of sherry. Turn into a glass dish. 
When partially formed stir into it the cupful of 
stewed prunes, stoned and chopped and two dozen 
almonds shelled, blanched and chopped. Stir the 
jelly until it is firm enough to keep the fruit and 
nuts from sinking to the bottom. Eat with cream, 
plain or whipped, and very cold. 

Jellied Oranges 
Mix a cupful of granulated sugar with a half-box 
of gelatine which has been soaked in enough cold 
water to cover it, put into a saucepan with three 
cupfuls of boiling water and stir until the gelatine 
is dissolved. Take from the fire, add a cupful of 
strained orange juice and a half-teaspoonful of cin- 
namon and strain through wet flannel. Have ready 
halved orange skins, from which you have removed 
the pulp carefully and wet these with cold water. 
Pour the jelly into them and put them where they 
will stand steadily until the jelly is firm. Serve in 
the skins, with a teaspoonful of whipped cream on 
top of each.

uliich all seeds .should \>r removed, with a coating of 
grated cocoanut, sprird<kd with sugar. Place in

sherry and topping the dish with the cocoanut and 
sugar. Leave on the ice for half an hour hefore it 
is to be served and liave the ingredients thorf)ughly 
chilled when you use them. When the dish is com- 
posed of lukewarm materials it is not pleasing to the 
taste. 

Macaroon Charlotte Russe 
Soak a quarter-box of gelatine for an hour in a 
half cup of milk and put it over the fire until the 
gelatine dissolves. Set it aside to cool and when en- 
tirely cold, but before it begins to stiffen, add it to 
a pint of cream which has been sweetened with half 
a cup of sugar and whipped. You may increase 
the amount by putting with it the whites of three eggs 
beaten to a standing froth, and flavor all with two 
teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Line a glass dish with 
macaroons softened with cream, custard or shen'v, 
fill the open space with the cream mixture and set 
in a very cold place to form and become chilled. 
It should be ready to cat three or four hours after it 
is made. 



RECIPES S33 

Homemade Charlotte Russe 
This may be made by the preceding recipe, using 
sliced sponge cake or lady fingers to line the mold 
instead of macaroons or by taking the crumb from 
the middle of a large round or brick-shaped sponge 
cake and filling it with the gelatine and cream mix- 
ture just described or with plain cream, sweetened, 
flavored and whipped. Serve very cold. 

Tipsy Parson 
Lay an oblong sponge cake in a glass dish and 
pour upon it slowly, a little at a time, enough sherry 
to soften and soak the cake well. Make a good soft 
custard by cooking four eggs with four cups of 
milk and four tablespoonfuls of sugar until this 
thickens, let it get cold and pour it on the cake. 
It should be thoroughly chilled before it is served. 

Syllabub 
Mix a little milk with double cream, sweeten and 
flavor it to taste and whip with a cream chum or 
whip or egg beater. As the cream thickens and the 
bubbles rise to the surface, take these off and put 
them into a chilled dish. Continue this until you 
have used up all the cream mixture. This is the 
genuine syllabub and is best when flavored with 
sherry. An improvement upon it may be made by 
heaping the froth upon sponge cakes soaked in sherry 
or in cream.
