HF.AU OF DFFAUTMENT OF 




INTRODUCTION. 



The investigations herein reported consist mainly of a 
study of meats, inrespect to methods of cooking, the losses incur- 
red "by different methods and the comparative effect on digestibil- 
ity of different methods of cooking. In connection v/ith the de- 
termination of the losses in hoiling meat, a study of the methods 
for the analysis of meat hroths was made. 

METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF BROTHS. 
Previous Work on Suhject. 

Some work on the improvement of methods for the analysis 
of meat and meat hroths had heen done in this lahoratorj^ during the 
preceding year. (T^ It was found then hy careful experiment that 
'no loss of nutrient material occurred "by volatilization in "boiling 
meat. All nutrients removed hy "boiling pass into the liquor or 
hroth. It is evidently then only necessary in order to determine 
the losses in "boiling meat , to analyze accurately the cooked meat 
and the soup. By summation of the constituents of these, the con- 
stituents of the original raw meat are computed, and thence the 
percentage loss of each. It is plain therefore that the accuracy 
of the experiments determining the losses in the hoiling of meat, 
and the relia"bility of the results o"btained rest almost entirely 
upon the accuracy and thoroughness of the analj'sis of the "broths. 

It should "be noted however in this connection that the sum 
of the constituents of cooked meat and "broth does not represent , 
strictly speaking, the original composition of the fresh raw meat. 
There have doubtless "been changes involved in the process of cook-

ing affecting the constitution of the nitrogenous "bodies in the 
meat, such as for exaraple , the formation of creatin, arnids, com- 
pounds, etc. froiii alhuinin. These simpler decomposition products 
constitute a large percentage of the nitrogenous matter in the 
soup , and hut a very small part of that in the rav/ meat . There 
would he error in assuming that all the nitrogenous "bodies in the 
"broth are contained as such in the original sample of meat. Un- I 
til further investigations are made however on the nature of these \ 
changes in nitrogenous matter hy cooking, we cannot do "better than 
regard the constituents of the "broth as representing the loss on 
cooking. I 
We have heen una'ble to find record of any investigations ' 
made in this country on the analysis of meat hroths. In Germanj'- 
considera"ble work has "been done "by Koenig, Stutzer, and others (2)@ 
on "meat extracts". These extracts, however, are prepared "by ex- 
tracting the juices of meat under pressure, and their composition 
and the methods used in their analysis are not compara'ble with that 
of soups prepared hy cooking. In 1884, A. Vogel (4^ made analyses i| 
of "broths resulting from the hoiling of meat hy different methods. 
He showed that more nutrients are ahstracted from the meat "by rais- i! 
ing the temperature gradually from cold to hoiling than hy placing 
the meat immediately in hoiling water and thus coagulating the al- I 
humen. He paid particular attention to the comparative amounts 
of total nitrogen in the two hroths. In 1893, Fr. Nothwang (F) 
made experiments to deterraine the losses involved in hoiling and 
steaming fresh and salted meat. He determined in the hroth the 
solid proteid material separated from the meat, and the salts and 
total nitrogen in the clear hroth, comparing the losses in the 
fresh and corned meat. 



In 1897, the French Chemist, A. Gautier © made analyses of meat, \ 
meat juices, meat ash, and meat broths, during the course of an in- 
vestigation of fresh and refrigerated "beef. His work on "broths 
was more complete than a.ny other of which record has "been found. 
He separated the different forms of nitrogen and the reducing ma- 
terials in the "broth. This work 7/ill he again referred to "below. 

Previously to the work descrihed in this thesis, it had \ 
been attempted in this la"boratory to analyze the broths by evapor- j 
ating to dryness and sampling for analysis the soli'ds thus obtained. 
(7^ The meclianical difficulties of sampling prevented good re- 
sults by this method. It was hence rejected and recourse was had 
to methods of sampling and analyzing the liquid broth itself. 
The chief difficulties to be overcome in this method seemed to be 
the following: 

1. to filter the r-b roth clear in a reasonably short time, 
thus making it possible to sainple it accurately, and to collect by 
this filtration all fat and suspended solid matter in a condition 
fit for drying, weig?iing, and analyzing. 

2. to determine accurately the total solids in the clear 
broth avoiding decomposition of nitrogenous matter. 

3. to determine the distribution, or forms of combination 

of the nitrogen in the clear broth. !! 

Methods for Filtration. 
In the cooking experiments which we describe belov/, it is 
considered that all material separated from the meat, either me- 
chanically, or by solution is included in the loss by cooking. 
Therefore in the analysis of the broth, it is necessary to filter 

I 



4. 

out and analyze all suspended solid matter, coarse and fine, as 
well as to analyze the resulting clear filtrate. 

By various attempts to filter the entire aiiount of "broth, 
trying in turn a Buechner porcelain funnel, a Gooch cruci"bl© with ll 
paper, the same with ashestos, and an ordinarj^- glass funnel with 
hardened paper filter, it was found impractica"ble to ohtain a clear 
filtration of the entire amount in a reasona'blj'' short time. In || 
all methods the pores of the filter appeared to hecome clogged hjr 
the suspended particles of fat and gelatinous material rendering 
the filtration so slow, that hefore it could he completed, a sep- 
aration of solid matter, due to decomposition took place in the || 
filtrate. It heing therefore impract icahle to filter the entire 
amount the only alternative seemed to he the filtration of an al- 
iquot portion sufficient for analysis. This method was adopted 
and found to he quite satisfactory. I 

By rapid cooling of the hroth to 15° C. immediately after 
cooking, and straining through a counterpoised piece of cheese- 
cloth, the coarser particles of solid matter and most of the fat, 
— solid at this temperature, — can he removed, dried, weighed, and 
analyzed. The strained hroth, — now of a fairly homogenous char- | 
acter, is made up to a definite volume ( usually 2000 c. c. ) and 
well mixed. Aliquot portions of 200 c. c. each are taken in du- 
plicate for filtration and analysis. This second filtration is | 
done through hardened papers, 11 c. m. in diameter, using suction. 
The papers having heen previously counterpoised, the residues can 
he dried and weighed. The hroth filters clear in this way, and 
200 c. c. when warned slightly, may he filtered in 30 minutes. 



5. 



Analysis of Residues from Filtration. 

The coarse residue on cheesecloth is dried at 100° C. over 
a weighed glass flaslc to catch the fat drippings, and complete ex- 
traction of the fat is then accomplished in the Soxhlet apparatus. 
After extraction the residue is weighed, the nitrogen determined 
"by the Kjehldaiil method, and the ash "by difference. 

The fine residue on paper is dried at 100° C. , weighed, ex- 
tracted for fat in Soxhlet tuhe and Kjehldahled for nitrogen. By 
hlank determinations, it was found that no nitrogen was contained 
either in the cheese-cloth or the filter paper used. Nitrogen in 
these residues was considered as heing entirely in the form of pro- 
tein ( nitrogen multiplied "by 6.25 ). 

Determination of Solids. 

To determine solids in the clear "broth we have experiment- 
ed with several methods in the endeavor to find one causing no de- 
composition of the nitrogenous constituents. By the simple meth- 
od of evaporating on the water hath and drying at 100° C. to con- 
stant weight, there was found to he no loss of nitrogen and no 
change in the amount of alhuminoids precipitated hy hromine. This 
fact was determined "by ohtaining the solids at the temperature nam- 
ed, in a Kjehldahl digestion flask, taking up again with hot water i 
and determining total and alhuminoid nitrogen as described helow. 

To check the results obtained hy this ordinary method of 
drying, however, two other methods were used. Ignited pumice 
stone in pieces the size of a pea was placed in shallow aluminum 
dishes, moistened with 5c. c. of water and dried exactly as des- 
cribed helow for the broth. i 



6. 

The dishes were vveighed and 5 c. c. of the hroth distrihuted even- 
ly over the piimice. This was partially dried at 70° - 80° C, 
5 c. c. more "broth added and this in turn partially dried at 70° - 
80°. The drying v/as then continued for eight hours at 75° C. in 
a slow current of dry air in a vacuum of 25 inches of mercury. 

The other method tried was as follows. 25 c. c. of "broth 
I was distri"buted over a strip of filter paper a"bout 7 c. m. "by 60 
c. ra. in size, which had "been previously dried and weighed . These 
strips containing the "broth were rolled up and dried in a vacuum as 
descri"bed a"bove for the pumice stone method. The weighings were 
made in telescopic tu"bes to avoid the a"bsorption of hygroscopic 
moisture. 

A comparison of results "b3'- the three methods on all the 



"broths analyzed is shown in the ta'ble:

It will "be seen that the results "by the pumice method are uniform- 

i 

ly high, while those Toy the paper coil method are low. The latter 
method is unsatisfactory since it is almost impossihle to avoid 
loss of small "bits of paper filler in handling. The ordinary meth- 
od gives lower results than the puiiice and therefore prohaloly ac- 
complishes a more thoroxigh drying. Since, as proven ahove, this 
method causes no loss of nitrogen, it was concluded to he the most 

ij 

satisfactorj'- of the three. 

Analysis of Clear Broth; 
Determination of Salts, and Ether Extract. 
In the filtered hroth were determined ether extract, nit- 
rogenous matter, and salts. To determine the salts, the solids 
were ignited to a red heat in platinum. The ether extract was oh- jj 
tained in a Soxhlet apparatus hy extracting eight hours with anhy- 
drous ether the solids from 25 c. c. distributed over a strip of 
ahsorhent paper, and dried thoroughly. A Kjehldahl determination 
on this extract showed no nitrogen present. 

Distrihution of Nitrogen. 

The distrihution of nitrogen in meat hroth as well as in 
meat juices and extracts seems to he an unsettled question. 

Se^lkowski and Giese (@)) found hy experiments in 1897 that ij 
" 1.2% of the nitrogen in meat is in extractive matter not coagul- 
ated "bY heat. This includes not only the flesh hases, hut also 
suhstances allied to protein such as alhiJimoses, peptones, amd the j| 

newly-discovered sarco -phosphoric acid." f

A. Gautier's work on neat iDroths ® to which reference has 
"been made ahove, showed the nitrogen to he distributed in the 
hroth as follows: 

Peptones and propeptones , - 28.8 of solids. 

Gelatinoids, - 14.1 " 

Creatin and other "bases, - 10.9 "fo " " 
He found ahout 8 ^ of the solids to consist of ijiosite, glycogen, 
and other reducing material, ahout 14 p extractives, and 24 "fo salts, 
the remainder ( 53.8 ) heing nitrogenous matter distributed as 
given ahove. 

We have attempted to separate albuminoids from flesh bases 
by the Bromine method of Wiley (9j The bromine was added in con- 
siderable excess to the acidulated broth ( with hydrochloric acid), 
the mixture well shaken and allowed to stand over night before fil- I 
tering out the precipitated albuminoids. The difference between 
the nitrogen in this precipitate and the total nitrogen in the same 
volume of broth was regarded as being in flesh bases entirely and 
the factor 3.12 used. For the precipitated albuminoids the fact- 
or 6.25 was used. The araount of proteid thus obtained v/as quite 
small in relation to the amount of flesh bases. Compared with 
those of Gautier, our results are as follows:

Gautier*s "broth may or majr not have "been filtered from the suspend- 
ed, coagulated protein. This however would affect only slightly | 
the figures given ahove , increasing "by perhaps 2 % our figures for ji 
alhuminoids , as a calculation from the amount of residues shows. | 

Koenig and Boemer (10) in an investigation of meat extracts, 
found in Liehig's Extract of Beef the nitrogen distrihuted as fol- 
lows: 

Alhumoses and allied compounds, - 12.6 fo 

Flesh Bases, - 73.4 ^ 

Ammonia - 5,1 

Other forms - 8.9 ^ 

Although our results on the distrihution of nitrogen hetv/een al- 
hurainoid material and flesh hases differ materially from those of : 
Gautier, on the other hand Koenig and Boemer 's finding of 73 f. of 
the nitrogenous matter in meat extract as flesh "bases agrees more 
nearly with our average of 75 fj for the same in "broth. Gautier 
states that his hroth was prepared hy hoiling 1 kilo, of "beef a 
long time in 2500 c. c. of water. Y/e have found it true ( see 
Cooking Experiment Nurnl:)er 24) that a long-continued "boiling separ- 
ates an excess of solid, coagulated al"bumen from the meat. His 



10. 

high per cent of allDuminoids may therefore Tdc expla,ined \)y the 
large amount of coagulated matter formed "by long "boiling. The 
state of division of the meat would also affect this separation of 
coagulated matter. Our "broths v/ere o"btained in nearly every case 
"by "boiling one large piece of meat ( a"bout 1 Kilo. ) for 2 hours in 
2000 c. c. of water. 

Allen and Searle (ll), claim that "bromine precipitates all 
al"bumen, peptones, and intermediate products such as al"bumoses, and 
Wiley holds that his Bromine Method is well adapted to meat ex- 
tracts, soups, and other meat products. 

Summation of Constituents. 
By summation of the salts, ether extract, and nitrogenous 
matter, we have in our analyses accounted for a"bout 75 ^ of the 
total solids in the clear "broth. Some of our analyses, compared 
with that of Gautier are shown in the ta"ble.

COOKING EXPERIIOTTS \'7ITH MEAT. 



Previous Work on SulDject. 



Previous investigations in this lal5oratory on the losses 
involved in the cooking of meats, (12^ have shown that on cooking a 



l| piece of heef round weighing alDOut two pounds, hy placing in hoil- 

ii 

ing water for 10 minutes, then cooling to 80° C. , and maintaining 
this temperature for two hours, the "beef loses one sixteenth of its 

1 

nitrogenous matter, one eighth of its fat, and one half of the min- 
eral salts. It was shown that these materials pass entirely into 

' the "broth, none heing lost "by volatilization. One or two experi- I 
ments were also made to determine whether any greater or less loss 
occurs if the meat "be placed first in cold water and this then grad^ i 

II ually raised to the "boiling point. The results of these latter 
experiments seemed to indicate that the losses "03'- the two methods 
of "boiling were practically the same. 



"broths were unsatisf actorj'- and incomplete, and the results of the 
"boiling experiments were not considered fully relia"ble. The ex- 
periments reported in this thesis were undertaken with a view to 
corrohorating the results of the previous year "by a more extended 
series of experiments, and "by the use of the more complete and sat- 
isfactory methods^ for "broth analysis which have "been descrihed a- 
hove. 

We have found no record of any cooking experiments made in 
this country on meat. H. Snyder of the Minnesota Agricultural Ex- 
periment Station (13)) and E. B. Voorhees of the New Jersey Station 




(14^, have investigated the losses incurred in the cooking of veg- 
etahles. A. Goss of the New Mexico Station ^s".) and Chas. E. Wait 



At that time the methods for sampling and analyzing the 






13. 

of the Tennesee Station 16. "nave studied carefully trie methods for 
the analysis of riieat. 

The work: of the German chemist, Nothwang, has "been referred 
to abore^ He made cooking experiments to compare "he losses on 
"boiling and steaming fresh and salted meats, analyzing, for total 
nitro-en, salts, and extractiTe matters, the "broths thus o"btained. 
Te have also referred to the wor> of C-autier at Paris on the com- 
paratiTe analyses of frash and ref ri.:;-erat9d heef . "e helled a 
kilogram of "beef a long time in 2500 c. c. of water and analyzed 
the resulting croth. He found in one liter, lc.4 grams of solids, 
made ur of peptones and propeptones 5.3 grams, gelatinoids 2.6 
grams, creatin and other hases 2.0 grams, inosite and glvcogen 1.4 
grams, extractives 2.6 grazas and salts 4.5 grams. 

In the present investigation we "nave performed eight exper- 
iments on the cooking of heef cy first placing in "boiling water and 
then cooking at 80° C. for two hours; four experiments "by "bringing 
gradually from cold to ooilin^, then reducing to 80^ C. and cooking 
thus two hours; and two experiments hy "bringing gradually from cold 
to 50° C. , and cooking thus for five hours. 

liethods of Cooking. 

Experiments :7unher 20, 21. 22, and 23, each of which was 
run in duplicate were conducted as follows: A piece of the first 
cut of "beef round, weighing from six to eight pounds, a"bout 3 iacb- 
es thick, and freshly cut from a whole side, was trimmed carefully 
of "bone and grissle, and most of the visi"ble fat removed. Two 
pieces, each weighing from 0.7 to 1.0 kilo., and as like as possi- 
ble in texture and fat content, were cut from this large piece and 
weighed qpiickly for the experiment. Each was plunged into 1500 



14. 

c. o. of rapidly "boiling distilled water and Tooiled vigorously'- for 
10 minutes. Cold water was then added until temperature was re- 
duced to 80°, which temperature was laaintained two hours. The 
meat was removed, suspended over the kettle to drain for 10 min- 
utes, weighed, passed through the sausage mill three times, well 
mixed, and sainpled for air-drying and analysis. The hroth was 
cooled to 15°, filtered and analj^zed. 

In Experiments No. 17 and 25, the meat was prepared for 
cooking as ahove descrihed, placed in cold water (at 20° C), and 
the temperature gradually raised during 45 minutes to the "boiling 
point. The hoiling was continued 10 minutes and cold water then 
added to reduce the temperature to 80°. This temperature was 
maintained two hours, and the cooked meat and "broth a,na.lyzed as 
"before. 

In Experiment No. 24, the meat was prepared as "before, 
placed in cold water, and the temperature gradually raised during 
30 minutes to 50° C. This temperature was roaintained for 5 hours, 
30 minutes, and the meat and "broth analyrzed as usual.

General Conclusions from Cooking Experiments. 

Prom the results of the eight experiments in which the meat 
was placed first in "boiling water and then cooked two hours at 80** 
C, we may conclude that heef cooked in this way loses approximate- 
ly 5.2 /a of its nitrogenous matter, 17.7 of its fat, and 56.4 ^ 
of its mineral matter. These constituents separated from the meat 
pass into the "broth, being partly in solution and partly held in 
suspension in the liquid. The loss of fat varies greatly, heing 
dependent upon the amount contained in the meat, — a greater amount 
sustaining a greater proportionate loss. These results agree well 
with those of the experiments made previously in this laboratory 
"by similar methods, viz: a loss of one-sixteenth of the nitrogenous 
matter, one eighth of the fat, and one half of the ash. The high- || 
er figure obtained in our experiments for the loss of fat is due 
to the greater amount of visible fat present in our samples before 
cooking. 

The size and thickness of the piece of meat cooked seems to 
influence the amount of loss in nutrients. The water penetrates 
farther into a small sample and dissolves more of the nutrient ma 
terial than in the case of a larger sample. A sample of beef 
round, weighing about two pounds, when boiled in the manner above 
described, loses 'on an average 44 of its weight; about 41.4 of 
the original meat is, by cooking, removed as water, or in other 
words, nearly two thirds of the water in the beef is lost in cook- 
ing; the remainder of the total loss consists in the nutrients die- 
solved by the boiling process, which material is on an average 2.6 
fo of the original meat. About six or seven per cent of the or- 



38. 

ganic nutrients is removed, and al^out 56 of the mineral matter. 

The results of the experiments in which the meat was placed 
first in cold water, raised gradually to the hoiling point, and 
then cooked two hours at 80°, show the percentages loss of the dif- 
ferent nutrients to "be practically the same as in the first method 
of cooking descrihed ahove. The figures for the amount of residue 
from filtration of the broths, show however that the amount of sus- 
pended, coagulated, nitrogenous matter in the "broth is "by this 
method much larger, — thus making a thicker and apparently richer 
soup. 

The two experiments in which the meat was cooked 5 hours at 
50° C. after starting in cold water are not very satisfactory as 
duplicates. The amount of fat and salts separated, however, is 
undou"btedly in this method considerably less than in the others on 
account of the low temperature, while the loss in nitrogenous mat- 
ter is slightly more, appearing in the great amount of fine sus- 
pended matter in the soup. Soups prepared in this way are dou"bt- 
less richer in nitrogenous matter of a nutritious nature, i.e. in 
proteids and proteoses, as distinguished from flesh "bases which 
are not nutritious, than are soups prepared "by the other methods 
descrilDed above; such soups are deficient however in fat and miner- 
al salts.

DIGESTION EXPERIJ.C5NTS. 
Introduction. 

During the past ten years a considera'ble number of experi- 
ments have "been made in this country on the natural digestion of 
food hy man. More coraraonly, perhaps, until quite recently, have 
studies on digestion "been made "by artificial methods or if hj'- nat- 
ural methods, then with the lower animals rather than man. 

The natural method of experim.ental inquin'" into the digest - 
ihility of food is, without douht , the most satisfactory'^ method, 
and the only one giving results comparable with the true conditions 
of life; and yet it must he acknowledged that an experiment of this 
nature leaves rauch to he desired in any results which can give in- 
sight into the question of rapidity and ease of digestion. The 
actual amount of food digested is detennined l-)y measuring the quan- 
tity of food eaten and the quantity of undigested residue excreted 
in the faeces. In regard to the time necessary for the digestion 
of different kinds of food, and the comparative ease with which 
they are digested, no information is obtained these methods. 

Dr. W. 0. Atwater of Wesleyan University has prohahly done 
more than any other investigator in this country to improve the 
methods and to intelligently interpret the results of natural di- 
gestion experiments with men. In his Bulletin 21, U. S. Depart- 



40. 



ment of Af;riculture , Office of E3q)eriinent Stations, he gives, in 
the course of a comprehensiTe treatise on the digest ilDility of 
foods, an historical EVimary of the sulDject, a discussion of meth- 
ods, and a statement of the needs, at that time, (1894) for further 
research. The first experiments of this kind which he mentions as 
"being of a.ny importance, were those of Ruhner, in 1876, at the Mun- 
ich Physiological Laboratory. Since t?:en there has "been consider- 
ahle activity in German3r and other foreign countries along this 
line. Dr. Atwater gives a comprehensive outline of the history 
of such investigations, adding a tabulated statement of the results 
obtained "hy different experimenters, (iv 




Since the publication of this bulletin, Atwater has himself 
made nany digestion experiments at the Connecticut Storrs Experi- 
ment Station, (18^; and under his direction, as special agent of the 
U. S. Dep't of Agri. on the subject of T'ood and Nutrition of Man, 
a great deal of vmrk has been done by other Experiment Stations 
throughout the country. Prof. Woods of Maine conducted experi- 
ments in 1894 - 1897, comparing the digestibility of different 
kinds of bread; (l9^ Prof. Wait of Tennessee performed a series 
of natural digestion experiments in 1895 - 1897, on a mixed diet 
@5 Pj"of . Snyder of Minnesota experimented in 1896 - 1898 on 
the digestibility of potatoes and eggs, and different kinds of 



bread ; Dr.' Atwater carried on ir 1894 - 1897 ar extensive 

series of natural digestion experiments on mixed diet at the Conn. 
Storrs Experiment Station @) , besides many others recently in 




connection with elaborate metabolism experiments in the " Respira- 



Of the experiments above mentioned, some have been of a com- 







41. 

parative nature, nota,'h)ly those at the Maine and Minnesota stations i 
on "bread. European inveeticators have endeavored also to ohtain 
comparative results on the digestihility of different kinds of 
"bread, (2Z)) , of different fats ^4>) , of rice and macaroni (25) ; 
and one, Porster, has studied the nutritive value and digestihility 
of "beef when cooked in different v/ays. (g6^ ^^e have not found re- 
cord of any experiments in this country made with the ohject of i 
comparing the digestihility of meat when cooked in different ways. i 
The importance of this question has "been thus stated "by Dr. Atv/ater ■ 
(277) : "One of the most important practical topics now demanding 

ii 

investigation, is the effect of cooking on the digestihility and 
nutritive value of food materials. " 

Experiments have heen made in this lahoratorj'- "by Dr. E. .S. 
Grindley, previous to t?ie work re]r)orted in this thesis, viz: in 
the summer of 1899, in which comparative results were obtained on || 
hoiled and fried "beef. 

In this thesis, we report the results of a series of eight 
experiments conducted during the winter and spring of 1899 - 190^, 
with the ohject of comparing the digest ihility of heef when cooked jj 
"by different methods. The conditions of the experiments were m.ain- 
tained as nearly as possihle the same throughout the series, with 
the exception of the one condition, the effect of which variation 
it was desired to note,—- this "being of course the method of cook- 
ing the heef . With this end in view the same person necessarily 
acted as su"bject throughout the series, and the same kinds and 
amounts of food were eaten, v/ith the exception of the meat. An 
effort was made also to keep the daily routine of the su"bject, the 
amount of exercise taken, and other minor details influencing the 



42. 



experiment, the same in all. 

It may TDe asstimed then, that any variation in the coeffi- 
cients of din-estihility ohtained in the different experiments is 
due to the variation in the character of the "beef. Prof, ^oods, 
however, in his experiments comparing the digestit-ility of differ- 
ent "breads, has calculated the actual coefficients for the "bread 
itself (eaten in a mixed diet), "by assuming ar"bitrary coefficients 
for the other articles of diet, computed from a great manj^ previ- 
ous experiments of others. This seems hardly necessary in our ex- 
periments since all conditions "but the one were kept the same 
throughout, and this varying condition should "be the chief cause 
of any variation in results. 



The mechanical manipulations followed were esseritiallj'- those 



of Atvirater, as descri"bed in his "bulletins. (13)^^^ The difference 
"between the total amount of food eaten "by the £5u"bject during the 
period of the experiment and the total indigestihle or unassimi- 
lated portion as represented "by the faeces is regarded as the a- 
mount of food digested and assimilated. The faeces contain small 
quantities of other matter in addition to the undigested residues 
of the food, — this "being, viz; meta'bolic products such as mucus, 
residues of digestive juices, etc. But the error involed here is 
small, and may "be disregarded, especially if vie consider these met- 
aholic products as not available to the system, in "building tissue 
or yielding energy and hence properly to "be classed as indigesti- 
"ble material. Vie use thus, the word " dicesti"bility " in the sense 
of " availa"bility I' For further opinions on this su"bject see

and 




Preliminary o"bservations and measurements were made to 



43. 

determine the amounts of food desiralDle for the suhject. Experi- 
ment TTumloer 11 may loe regarded as preliminary and not of the com- 
parative series. Each food material vias prepared in sufficient || 
quantity for the period, a representative sample taken for analy- 
sis, and portions for food accurately weighed into quick-sealing 

i 

glasB fruit jars. All the food necessary was thus prepared pre- 
vious to the "beginning of the experiment. The methods used for 
analysis of foods and faeces were the Official Methods of the As- 
sociation of Official Agricultural Chemists. A representative 
sample of the entire, well-mixed, lot was taken for analysis and, I 
if not quite dry, was suhjected to the process of air-drj'ing hefore 
analyzing completely. 

To separate the faeces "belonging to the period of the exper- 
iment , a meal of "bread and milk with three lamp-'black capsules I 
(containing a"bout 0.5 grara) , was eaten immediately "before and im- 
mediately after the period. The faeces from these meals are col- 
ored "black. 

The total amount of urine for the period of the experiment 
was collected in 24 hour portions, the "Nitrogen Lag" "being regard- 
ed as 12 hours, and the nitrogen determined in each lot. By com- 
paring the total nitrogen in the food, with that excreted in urine 
and faeces, the "balance of income and outgo of nitrogen may "be ©"b- 
served or any gain or loss of protein noted. The su"bject was 
weighed, stripped, on the first morning of the experiment and again 
on the morning next after the close of the experiment. 

The following ta"bles need no explanation.

Discussion of Results of Digestion Experiments. 

i| 

The results of the ahove digestion experiments seem to in- 
dicate that heef round, eaten in a mixed diet, is more completely i| 
digested when fried, (without the addition of fat), than when cook- |j 
ed "by any of the other methods tried. The duplicate experiments 
agree well in the case of Exp'ts 14 - 15, and 18 -.19, hut do not 
agree closely in the others. The results of Exp'ts 12 and 13 may 
not he considered reliahle, as a good separation of faeces was not 
ohtained. In the other experiments however good separations were 
made. 

The results of this series of experiments agree well with 
those of Dr. Grindley ohtained in July and August 1899, hut are 
higher than those of Atwater and Wait.
