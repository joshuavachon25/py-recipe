PREFACE. 



The ad^/anced state of the art of Cookery Iiavirig rendered 
Mrs. Rundell's book insufRcient for the guidance of the 
modern cook, it has been found necessary to remodel her 
work, and to replace those receipts which have become 
obsolete by others founded upon the newer methods adopted 
by the best cooks of the present day. 

The present enlarged collection of original receipts will be 
found to possess strong claims to attention, having been care- 
fully selected from family MSS., tried and vouched for by 
the parties from whom they have been obtained. In the 
choice of them great attention has been given to the subject 
of economy ; and the arrangement of the whole work, pre- 
viously enriched with the valuable contributions of the late 
Miss Emma Roberts,'' has been placed under the careful 
inspection of a Lady of long experience in housekeeping. 
The book has had the further advantage of being thoroughly 
revised by a professional gentleman of great repute in London, 
v.'ho has also supplied several valuable receipts. 

"Without wishing to disparage any of the numerous modern 
productions which have been given to the public, it may be 
affirmed that, although the treatises of professional cuisiniers 

" The receipts marked E. R. -were contributed by Miss Roberts, 

a 2 



iv PREFACE. 



on the subject are valuable to those who are competent to 
carry out their receipts, yet, generally speaking, they are too 
scientific for the comprehension of common cooks, as well as 
too expensive for the greater number of private families. 

It has, therefore, been thought advisable to confine this 
work to a collection of plain and useful receipts, the result 
of experience and practice, adapted for those families of 
moderate fortune in which a certain degree of elegance is 
combined with attention to domestic economy. The number 
of editions ^ which Mrs. Eundell's celebrated work has passed 
through is the best test of its utility; and it is confidently 
expected that the number and value of the additional receipts 
and precepts which are here given will place it still higher in 
public estimation. 

Among the novel features in this volume as now offered to 
the public may be mentioned — 1. the great increase in the 
number and variety of receipts ; 2. a greater simplification of 
language in order to render the receipts more easy of com- 
prehension; 3. the illustrative w^oodcuts; 4. the mode of 
printing in figures all numbers and quantities for the sake 
of clearness; and 5. the Tables for computing household 
accounts. All these improvements will, it is hoped, con- 
rribute much to the utility and popularity of the work.

An inch is the smallest lineal measure to -which a name is given, but 
subdivisions are used for many purposes. Among mechanics, the inch is 
commonly divided into eighths. By the officers of the revenue and by 
scientific persons it is divided into tenths, hundredths, &c. Formerly it 
was made to consist of 12 parts, called lines.

The four last denominations are used for dry goods only. For liquids 
RC-VL^ral denominations have been heretofore adopted, viz. : — For Beer, the 
Firkin of 9 Gallons, the Kilderkin of IS, the Barrel of 36, the Hogshead 
of 54, and the Butt of 108 Galls. These will probabl}^ continue to be 
used in practice. For Wine and Spirits, there are the Anker, Eunlet, 
Tierce, Hogshead, Puncheon, Pipe, Butt, and Tun ; but these may be 
considered rather as the names of the casks in which such commodities 
are imported, than as expressing any definite number of gallons. It is 
the practice to gauge all such vessels, and to charge them according to 
their actual contents. 

Flour is sold nominally by measure, but actually by weight, reckoned 
at 7 ib. Avoirdupois to a Gallon.

If our ancestors made domestic occupations too exclusively 
the aim of female education, it may be trulv said that the 
present generation has fallen as unwisely iv o the contrary 
extreme. It is indeed a very common, but ' very erroneous 
supposition, that attention to culinary affairs is unnecessary in 
a gentlevroman ; yet there can be no question that elegance, 
comfort, social enjoyment, and, it may be added, healtli, 
materially depend upon attention to the table ; and the pru- 
dent management of her famil}- ought to be considered an 
important object amongst the duties of every lady when she 
marries. 

There are comparatively few persons among the middle 
classes of society who can afford to keep professed cooks, their 
wages being too high, and their methods too extravagant. In 
such cases a p/ai?i cook is alone attainable, who knows little 
beyond the commonest operations of the kitchen. The mistress 
ought therefore to make herself so far acquainted with cookery 
as to be competent to give proper directions for di'essing a 
dinner, and having it properly served up. 

Peiliaps there are few pcinrs on which the respectability 



2 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Cha.i>. I. 

of a man is more immediately felt, than the style of dinner to 
which he may accidentally bring- home a visitor. Every one 
ought to live according to his circumstances, and the meal of 
the tradesman ought not to attempt to emulate the entertain- 
ments of the higher classes ; but if the dishes be well served, 
with the proper accompaniments, the table-linen clean, the 
sideboard neatly laid, and all that is necessary be at hand, 
the comfort of both husband and friend will be increased by 
the usual domestic arrangements not having been interfered 
with. 

Hence the direction of a table is no inconsiderable branch 
of a lady's duties, as it involves judgment in expenditure, 
respectability of appearance, and the comfort of her husband 
as well as of those who partake of their hospitality. Inatten- 
tion to it is always inexcusable, and should be avoided for the 
lady's own sake, as it occasions a disagreeable degree of bustle 
and evident annoyance to herself, which is never observable in 
a well-regulated establishment. In doing the honours of her 
table, the mode of carving is also of importance, and will be 
treated of in a future chapter. 

The mode of covering the table differs according to taste. 
It is not the multiplicity of dishes, but the choice, the dressing, 
and the neat look of the whole, which give an air of refinement 
to a table. There should always be more than the necessary 
quantity of plate, or plated ware, and glass, to afford a certain 
appearance of elegance ; and these, v/ith a clean cloth a,nd a 
neatly-dressed attendant, will show that the habits of the 
family are those of gentility. For a small party, or a ttte-a~ 
tete, a dumb waiter is a convenient contrivance, as it partly 
saves the attendance of servants. The cruets should be looked 
to and filled every day an hour before diimer; and much 
trouble and irregularity are saved, when there is company, if 
servants are accustomed to prepare the table and sideboard in 
similar order every day. Too many or too few dishes are 
extremes not uncommon : the former encumbering the dinner 
with a superfluity which partakes of vulgarity, whilst the latter 
has the appearance of poverty or penuriousness. 



CuAV. I. BIRECTIO^T OF A TABLT:. 3 

In all situations of life the entertainment should be no less 
suited to the station than to the fortune of the entertainer, as 
well as to the number and rank of those invited. If the ar- 
rangements of the table be properly studied, a degree of 
elegance is attainable under all circumstances, however econo- 
mical ; and the plainest fare, if carefully dressed, may be made 
to furnish dishes Avhich every one will eat with relisli. 

Should there be only a joint and a pudding, they should 
always be served up separately ; and the dishes, however small 
the party, should always form two courses. Thus, in the old- 
fashioned style of entertaining a couple of friends with '• fish, 
soup, and a roast," the soup and fish should be placed at the 
top and bottom of the table, removed by the joint with veget- 
ables and pastry ; or, should the company consist of eight or 
ten, a couple or more of side dishes in the first course, ^^ith 
game and a pudding in the second, accompanied by confec- 
tionery, would be quite sufficient. 

In most of the books which treat of cookery, various bills of 
fare are given, v/hich are never exactly followed. The mis- 
tress should select those dishes which are most in season. The 
cuts which are inserted in some of those lists put the soup in 
the middle of the table, Avhere it should never be placed. Fcr 
a small party a single lamp in the centre is sufficient ; but for 
a larger number the room should be lighted with lamps hung 
over the table, and the centre occupied by a, plateau of glass 
or plate, ornamented with flowers or figures. 

The mistress of a family should never forget that the welfare 
and good management of the house depend on the eye of the 
superior; and, consequently, that nothing is too trifling for her 
notice, whereby waste may be avoided or order maintained. 
If she has never been accustomed, while single, to think of 
family management, let her not upon that account fear that 
she cannot attain it : she may consult others who are more 
experienced, and acquaint herself vdth the necessary quantities, 
quality, and prices of the several articles of expenditure in a 
family, in proportion to the number it consists of. The chiej 
diitiGs of life are within the reach of humble abilities, and she

Avhose aim is to fulfil them, will rarely ever fail to acquit her- 
self well. United with, and perhaps crowning all, the virtues 
of the female character, is that well-directed ductility of mind 
which occasionally bends its attention to the smaller objects of 
life, knowing them to be often scarcely less essential than the 
greater. 

A minute account of the annual income and the times of 
payment should be kept in writing ; likewise an estimate of 
the supposed amount of each article of exjiense ; and those 
who are early accustomed to calculations on domestic articles 
will acquire so accurate a knowledge of what their establish- 
ment requires, as will enable them to keep the happy medium 
between prodigality and parsimony. 

In apportioning the items of expenditure of a family, some- 
thing should always be assigned for the use of the poor, which 
enables any pressing case of distress to be at once attended to, 
without a question " whether the money can be spared." Much 
might be done for the poor if care were taken to keep a pan, 
into which every bone and morsel of spare meat, vegetables, 
&c., were put : these might be stewed, the bones taken out, 
and a few peas added, making a meal, two or three times a 
week, for any poor deserving family, without increasing the 
family expenditure beyond a few pence. 

Perhaps ^lew branches of female education are more useful 
than great readiness in figures. Accounts should be regularly 
kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be entered. If 
l)alanced every week or month, the income and outgoings will 
be ascertained with facility, and their proportions to each other 
be duly observed. Some people fix on stated sums to be ap- 
propriated to each different article, as house, clothes, pocket, 
education of children, &c. Whatever may be the amount of 
household expenditure, a certain mode should be adopted, and 
strictly adhered to. Besides the regular account-book, in whicli 
the receipt of money and every payment should be regularly 
entered, a commonplace-book should be always at hand for 
the entry of observations regarding agreements with servants 
tradesmen, and various other subjects, so as to enable the mis

tress of the house at once to ascertain the exact state of the 
a Hairs under her immediate manag-ement. 

IP ant of arrangement leads to loss of time ; and time, if 
lost, can never be regained. Early hours, order, punctuality, 
and metliod, are its great economists, and cannot be too rigidly 
enforced. If orders be given soon in the morning-, there will 
be more time to execute them ; and servants, by doing' their 
work witliout hurry and bustle, will be more likely to do it 
well, and fewer might be necessary. 

To give unvarying rules cannot be attempted, as people 
ought to act differently under different circumstances : the 
minutiae of management must therefore be regulated by every 
one's fortune and rank, but there are many general rules which 
AN ill be found equally advantageous to all. 

It is very necessary for the mistress of a family to be in- 
formed of the prices and goodness of all articles in common 
use, and of the best times, as well as places, for purchasing 
tliem. She should also be acquainted with the comparative 
prices of provisions, in order that she may be able to substi- 
tute those that are most reasonable, when they will ans\\er as 
well, for others of the same kind, but which are more costly. 
On this, however, it has been well remarked, in that very 
useful publication ' Tlie Magazine of Domestic Economy,' 
that " small flimilies should never encumber themselves with 
huge and perhaps awkward pieces of even excellent meat, 
under the idea that it is cheap, because offered beloAV the 
market-price : nominally it may be so, but in the end it v,\\\ 
be found exceedingly dear. There will necessarily be a large 
portion of bone ; and if soups be not AA-anted, the bones will be 
made no use of, although they not only weigh heavy, but are 
paid for at the same price as the prime parts of the meat." 

Those who cannot afford to give the high prices demanded 
for the best joints are recommended to purchase what are 
termed " the inferior joints," provided they be of the best 
qualitij : thus, a shoulder of good nuitton or veal is far prefer- 
able to the leg or fillet of an ill-conditioned sheep or calf. 
Ijifevior meat will never do credit to the cook, but inferior 



6 MODERN' DOMESTIC COOKERY. Ckap. I. 

. « 

joints may be improved by cookery, and rendered equal to 
the best. It is the same with fish : a good fresh brill being 
infinitely preferable to a stale turbot ; while one fresh egg 
will go as far as three which have lost their richness by long 
keeping. In short, the purchase of " cheap things " will 
generally be found false economy. 

Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one's honesty, 
it is yet prudent to weigh meat, sugar, &c., when bronglit in, 
and to compare the weight with the charge. It would be as 
well if milkmen and bakers were to have tallies with the cook, 
on which everj^ quart of milk or loaf of bread may be marked, 
as they will serve to prevent overcharges. The butcher sliould 
be ordered to send a ticket with the meat ; and the cook, after 
weighing the meat, should file these tickets, to be examined 
when the weekly bill is delivered. Scales should be placed 
in the kitchen, near the door used by the tradespeople. The 
knowledge that v/eights and scales are in use, will operate a-s 
a check to any petty fraud which might otherv/ise be at- 
tempted. 

Respecting servants, there are a few things which cannot be 
too strongly urged : one is, never to retain a cook who is not 
fond of her occupation ; for unless she takes pleasure in her 
art, she cannot be depended upon for accuracy in the prepa- 
ration of dislies with which she is well acquainted, and will 
not easily be induced to learn anything new. She must also 
possess a natural regard for cleanliness, or all the pains in the 
world will never render her cleanly : where dirty habits are 
manifested, dismissal should follow, for in almost every in- 
stance they will be found incurable. Another point of main 
importance is her temper ; for if that be not good, she will be 
disinclined to receive instruction, and, if found fault with, may, 
out of pique, spoil a dinner ; whereas a good-humoured, intel- 
ligent servant, when acquainted with the habits of the house, 
and equal to her common duties, will hardly fail of success 
when called upon by her mistress to try any of those receipts 
which she has not already used. 

It behoves all persons to be extremely careful wh(jni they 



Chap. I. SERVANTS. 



take into their service ; to be veiy minute in investigating the 
character they receive, and equally cautious and scrupulously 
just in giving one to others. Were this more . generally at- 
tended tOj many evils would be avoided which now result from 
worthless servants being put into places of trust. It may be 
fairly asserted that the unfaithfulness of a servant, which is 
but a milder epithet for robbery or waste, will be laid to the 
charge of that master or mistress who, knowing or having 
well-founded suspicions of such faults, is prevailed upon, by 
false pity or entreaty, to slide a servant into another place ; 
but, on the other hand, it would be unjDardonablj" imjust to 
refuse to give a fair and candid representation of merits and 
demerits, on any plea whatever. 

As to luages, it is better to err on the liberal than on the 
niggardly side ; for the trifling difference in ^-ages between 
a good and a bad cook will soon be m.ade up by the former, 
not only in the comfort but the economy of the table. Ser- 
vants' wa.ges should be paid regularly. Perquisites of all kinds 
should be strictly forbidden, as not unfrequently leading to 
pilfering and the corruption of common honesty. Do not allow 
servants to pay your tradesmen's bills, but let the tradesmen 
call for them. Nor should small tem.ptations be laid in the 
M'ay of young servant^;, particularly females who have the 
care of ladies' dresses and jewellery, as many an honest girl 
has been led to become a thief through the incamtiousness of 
her mistress. 

In the hiring of servants it is an excellent plan to agree to 
increase their wages annually to a fixed sum, at which it should 
stop ; and to recommend that a portion of it should be regu 
larly placed in a savings-bank. An incentive will thus be 
offered to good conduct ; and when the hoard saved up amounts 
to any considerable sum, the possessor will generally feel more 
inclined to increase than to lessen it. 

A kindly feeling of indulgence on the part of a mistress 
towards her servants in the matter of petty faults, coupled witli 
good-natured attention to tlieir daily comforts, and occasional 
permi.ssion to visit and receive a few of their near friends 



8 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKE liY. Chap. I. 

would go far to create a cordial degree of attaclnneiit, whicli 
must ever be desirable in a respectable family, and is clieiiply 
purcliased by such consideration. Mildness of language Avill 
generally be met by resj^ectful language on the part of a 
servant, and of itself will produce a saving of temper at least 
to the master or mistress. Due praise will mostly be found a 
powerful stimulus to good, and in some measure a preventive 
to bad conduct, on the part of a servant. 

To young beginners in housekeeping, the following brief 
hints on domestic economy , in the management of a moderate 
income, may perhaps prove acceptable. 

AVhenever anything is bought a l)ill of parcels and a receipt 
should 1)0 required, even if the money be paid at the time of 
purchase ; and, to avoid mistakes, the goods should be com- 
pared with these when brought home ; if the money is to be 
{)aid at a future period, a bill should be sent with the articles 
and regularly filed. 

An inventor}' of furniture, linen, and china should be kept, 
and the things examined by it twice a-year, or oftener if there 
be a change of servants ; the articles used by servants should 
be intrusted to their care with a list, as is done with plate. In 
articles not in common use, such as spare bedding, &c., tickets 
of parchment, numbered and specifying to what they belong, 
should be sewed on each ; and minor articles in daily use, such 
as household cloths and kitchen requisites, should be occasion- 
ally looked to. The best means to preserve blankets from 
moths is to fold and lay them under the feather-beds that are 
in use, and shake them occasionally ; Avhen soiled, they should 
be washed, not scoured. 

The most durable sort of linens for sheeting are the Russia, 
German, or Irish fabrics ; a good stock of which, as well as 
of tabie-linen, should be laid in to avoid the necessity of fre- 
quent or irregular washing. 

A pro[)er quantity of household articles should always be 
allowed for daily use. Each should also be kept in its proper 
place, and applied to its proper use. Let all repairs be done 
n.s soon as wanted, remembering the old adage of " a stitch m 



Chap. I. HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 9 

time/' &c. ; and never, if possible, defer any necessary liouse- 
hold concern beyond the time -vvlien it ought to be attended to. 

In the purchase of glass and crockery-ware, either the most 
customary patterns should be chosen, in order to secure their 
being easily matched when broken, or, if a scarce design be 
adopted, an extra quantity should be bought, to guard against 
the amioyance of the set being spoiled by breakage, which in 
the course of time must be expected to happen. There should 
likewise be plenty of common dishes, that the table-set may 
not be used for putting away cold meat, &c. 

The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals and 
cinders : there is a new contrivance for sifting the latter with- 
out dispersing the dust, by means of a covered tin bucket. 

Small coal wetted makes the strongest fire for the back of 
the grate, but must remain untouched till it cakes. Cinders 
lightly wetted give a great degree of heat, and are better than 
coal for furnaces, ironing-stoves, and ovens. 

A Store-room is essential for the custody of articles in con- 
stant use, as well as for others which are only occasionally 
called for. These should be at hand when wanted, each in 
separate di'awers, or on shelves and pegs, all under the lock 
and key of the mistress, and never given out to the servants 
but under her inspection. 

Pickles and preserves, prepared and purchased sauces, anci 
all sorts of groceries, should be there stored ; the spices 
pounded and corked up in small bottles, sugar broken, and 
everything in readiness for use. Lemon-peel, thyme, parsley, 
and all sorts of sweet herbs, should be dried and grated for 
use in seasons of plenty ; the tops of tongues saved, and dried 
for grating into omelettes, &c. ; and care taken that nothing- 
be wasted that can be turned to good account. 

Bread is so heavy an article of expense, that all waste 
should be guarded against, and having it cut in the room 
will tend much to prevent it ; but, for company, small rolls, 
placed in the napkin of each guest, are the most convenient, 
as well as the most elegant. Bread should be kept in eartheii 
pans with covers. 



10 MODEHN domestic cookers. Chap. I. 

Sugar being also an article of considerable expense in 
all families, the jDurchase demands particular attention. The 
cheapest does not go so far as that more refined, and there is a 
difference even in the degree of sweetness. The close, heavy, 
and shining white, or loaf-sugar, should be chosen. The best 
sort of brown has a bright crystalline appearance, as if mixed 
with salt ; and, if feeling coarse when rubbed between the 
fingers, is better than when more powdery. East India sugars 
are finer for the price, but not so strong, consequently unfit 
for wines and sweetmeats, but do well for common purposes. 
To pound white sugar, rolling it with a bottle and sifting 
wastes it less than a mortar. 

Both soap and talloio candles are improved by keeping, 
and are best when made in cool weather ; at which time it will 
be- prudent to lay in a stock of both. They are, indeed, better 
for being kept eight or ten months, nor will they injure for 
two years if kept in a cool place ; and there are few articles 
that better deserve care in buying, and allowing a regulated 
quantity of, according to the size of the family. As to the 
sort of moulds, " short sixes " are the best for common do- 
mestic purposes, as, after dinner, workers or readers are better 
acconmiodated with light from candles of that size and height 
than from those called " long sixes," which look poor and 
thin ; but " fours " are preferable to either. Of kitchen 
candles, those of ten to the pound will be found more service- 
able than either eight or twelve. 

Wax, spermaceti, and composite candles ought to be always 
purchased in quantities of not less than a dozen pounds, on 
which an allowance is usually made by the chandler. 

Gas is not much used in private houses, except in ofiices 
and passages. Oil-lamps have the advantage of affording a 
brilliant light and being of elegant appearance, but they are 
very troublesome in management, as well as expensive. Every 
year there is a change in lamps, but there has not yet been 
anything offered to the public which equals for domestic use 
the Palmer candle-lamp. 

Soap should be ciit into pieces when first brought in, and 



Chap. I. HINTS ON DOMESTIC ECONOMY. 11 

kept out of the air two or three weeks ; for, if it dries quickly, 
it will crack, and, when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leaving 
a space between each piece, and let it grow hard gradually : 
thus it will save a full third in the consumption ; but, for 
coarse washing, soft soap will go further than the hard. 

Soda, by softening the water, saves a great deal of soap. 
It should be melted in a large jug or pail of water, some of 
which pour into the tubs and boiler. The new improvement 
in soft soap is, if properly used, a saving of nearly half ii* 
quantitj^, and, though somewhat dearer than the hard, reduce^ 
the price of washing considerably. 

Many good laundresses advise soapirig linen into warm 
water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the opera- 
tion, and less friction being required. 

The price of starch depends upon that of flour ; the bt«t 
\\ill keep good in a dry warm room for some years. 

Everything should be kept in the place best suited to it, as 
much waste may thereby be avoided. 

Great care should be taken of jelly-bags, tapes for collared 
meats, &c., v hich, if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give 
an unpleasant flavour when next used. 

Vegetables will keep best on a stone floor, if the air be 
excluded ; meat, in a cold dry place, where the air is freely 
admitted ; sugar and siceetmeats require a dry place, so does 
salt ; candles, a cold, but not damp place ; dried meats, hams, 
bacon, and tongues, the same. All sorts of seed for puddings, 
such as rice, &c., should be close covered, to preserve them 
from insects ; but if kept long that will not be sufficient, 
unless they be occp^sionally sifted. Apples and pears should 
be laid U2Don very clean and dry straw, to prevent a musty 
taste ; nor should they be exposed to either light or air ; the 
floor of a dark garret is a good place on which to deposit 
them ; or, what is still better, shelves made by strips of wood, 
of about 2 inches wide, placed an inch and a half apart, and 
the apples laid between them. They should be ranged singly 
in rows, without touching each other, and should be often in- 
spected, both to wipe them, if damp, and to reject those which 



12 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. I. 

may appear to be getting rotten. The larger sort of pears 
should be tied up by the stalk. Apples may also be preserved 
in excellent condition for a long period by being packed in 
large barrels with dry sand, but require to be used immedi- 
ately they are taken out. 

Coarse nets suspended in the store-room are very useful in 
preserving the finer kinds of fruit, lemons, &c., which are 
spoiled if allowed to touch. When lemons and oranges are 
cheap, a proper quantity should be bought and prepared, both 
for preserving the juice, and keeping the peel for sweetmeats 
and grating, especially by those who live in the country'', where 
they cannot always be had ; and they are perpetually wanted 
in cookery. 

The best way of scalding fruits, or of boiling vinegar, is in 
a stone jar, on a hot iron hearth, or by putting the vessel into 
a saucepan of boiling water, after it has been closely corked, 
but not quite filled, as the heat may occasion the fruits to 
swell ; but if they diminish after they are cool, the vessel 
must then be filled. 

Onions, shcdots, and garlic should be hung up, for winter 
use, in ropes from the ceiling ; as should dried parsley, basil, 
savory, and knotted-marjoram, or London-thyme, and tarra- 
gon, to be used when herbs are ordered, but with discretion, 
as they are very pungent. 

When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other purposes, 
pudding, custard, &c., should be made to employ the yolks 
also ; and when only the yolks are wanted, the whites can be 
made with milk into blancmange. Should they not be wanted 
for several hours, beat them up with a little water, and put 
them in a cool place, or they will be hardened and useless. It 
was a mistake of old to think that the whites made cakes and 
puddings heavy ; on the contrary, if beaten long and sepa- 
rately, they contribute greatly to give lightness, and are also 
an improvement in paste.

ON CARVING. 

Necessity of Practice in Carving — Beef : Round or Aitch-bone — Ribs —

— Fore-quarter of Lamb, — Venison : Haunch — Neck. — Roebuck — 
Kid. — Pork — Ham — Tongue — Sucking Pig — Hare — Rabbit —

Although carving with ease and elegance is a very neces- 
sary accomplishment, yet most people are lamentably deficient, 
not only in the art of dissecting 'vvinged game and poultry, 
but also in the important point of knov.ing the parts most 
generally esteemed. Practice only can make a good carver ; 
but the directions here given, with accompanying plates, will 
enable any one to disjoint a fowl and avoid the awkwardness 
of disfiguring a joint. 

In the first place, whatever is to be carved should be set in 
a dish sufficiently large for turning it if necessary ; but the 
dish itself should not be moved from its position, which should 
be so close before the carver as only to leave room for the 
plates. The carving-knife should be light, sharp, well- 
tempered, and of a size proportioned to the joint, strength 
being less required than address in the manner of using it. 
Large solid joints, such as ham, fillet of veal, and salt beef, 
cannot be cut too thin ; but mutton, roast pork, and the other 
joints of veal, should never be served in very delicate slices. 

A Bound (buttock) or Aitch-bone of Beef. — Pare off from

Bibs of Beef. — Cut along the whole length of the boiie, 
from end to end, either commencing in the centre or at one 
side, having the thin end towards you; but if boned and 
formed into a round, with the fat end doubled into the centre. 

it must then be cut in the 
same manner as the round 
of beef. 

Sirloin of Beef — Cut 
in the same manner as the 
ribs, from a to b, com- 
mencing either at the 
centre or the side. The 
c under part should be cut

the lean, and d for the ricli fat ; many persons prefer the 
under to the upper part, the meat being more tender. 

Fillet of Veal. — Carve 
it in the same manner as 
the round of beef, but 
the upper slice should be 
cut somewhat thinner ; as 
most persons like a little 
of the brown, a portion 
of it should be served 
along with each slice, to-

to disjoint the ribs. 

Neck of Veal. 

Ijoin of Veal. — The joint is placed in the dish in the same 
manner as sirloin of beef, but with a toast put under it. The 
meat should be cut across the ribs as in the neck, serving a 
slice of kidney, fat, and toast to each person. 

Breast of Veal, being very gristly, is not easily divided

into pieces. In order, therefore, to avoid this difficulty, put 
your knife at «, about 4 inches from the edge of the thickest 
part (which is . r e 

called " the bris- 
ket"), and cut 
through it to Z), to 
separate it from 
the long ribs ; cut 
the short bo?ies 
across, as at d d d, 
and the long ones 
as at c c c ; ask 
which is chosen, and help accordingly. The remaining scrag 
part is seldom served at table, but forms an excellent stew 
when dressed in the French mode. 

Shoulder of Veal. — Cut it on the under side in the same 
manner as a shoulder of mutton. 

Calfs Head. — Cut slices from a to h, letting the knife go 
close to the bone. Many like the eye, at c, which you must 
cut out with the 
point of your 
knife, and divide 
in , two, along 
with some of the 
glutinous bits 
which surround 
it. If the jaw- 
bone be taken off, 
there will be found some tine lean, and under the head is the 
palate, which is reckoned a delicacy. 

The tongue and brains are dished separately, but should bo 
eateu with the head. 



Leg of Mutton. 
— The best part of 
a leg of mutton, 
whether boiled or 
roasted, is midway 
between the knuckle 
and the broad end.

and thickest part, by cutting slices, not too thin, from b down 
to c. This part is the most juicy ; but many prefer the 
knuckle, which, in fine mutton, will be very tender, though 
dry. There are very fine slices in the back of the leg ; there- 
fore, if the party be large, turn it up, and cut the broad end ; 
not across, in the direction you did the other side, hut long- 
ivise, from the thick end to the knuckle-bone. To cut out 
the cramp-bone, "which some persons look upon as a delicacy, 
pass your knife under in the direction of e, and it will be found 
between that and d. 

Shoulder of Mutton^ though commonly looked upon as a 
very homely joint, is by many prefen-ed to the leg, as there 
is much variety of flavour, as well as texture, in both the upper 
and under parts. 

The figure repi^esents it laid in the dish, as always ser-^/'ed, 

with its hack uppermost.

slices in the direction

near the shank-bone at h ; 
and, lengthwise, in broad 
pieces, at the further end 
«; as well as in the 
middle and sides in the manner designated at c and d. 

Should it be intended to reserve a portion of the joint to be 
eaten cold, the under part should be first served, both because 
it eats better hot than cold, and because the upper remaining 
part will appear more sightly when again brought to table.

Necli of Mutton. — Should be prepared for table as follows : — 
Cut oft' the scrag ; have the cliine-bone carefully sawn off, and 
also the top of the long bones (about H inch), and the thiL 
part turned under ; carve in the direction of the bones. 

Saddle of Mution. — Cut in long and rather thin slices from 
the tail to the end, beginning at each side close to the back, 
bone, from a to /;, 
with slices of fat 
from c to d\ or 
along the bone which 
divides the two loins,

both fat and lean. The tail end should be divided and turned 
round the kidneys, or, if preferred, a bunch of 
flowers skewered on the tail end. 

Haunch of Mutton. — A haunch is the leg and part of the 
loin, and is cut in the same manner as a haunch of venison. 

Fore- Quarter of Lamb. — Pass the knife under the shoulder 
in the direction of «, c, b, d, so as to separate it from the ribs 
without cutting the meat too much off the bones. A Seville 
orange or lemon should then be divided, the halves sprinkled 
^^ ith salt and pepper, and the juice squeezed over the under part. 
A little cold butter is then put between both parts; this 
is now considered 
" old fashioned," 
and is seldom done. 
If the party is small, 
remove the shoulder 
to a separate dish. 
Divide the ribs from 
d to e, and then 
serve the neck /,

Neck of Venison. — Cut across the ribs diagonally as in the 
saddle of mutton ; or in slices the whole length of the neck. 
The first method is equally good, and much more economical. 

Hcebuck. — A species of venison but little known in this 
country, but which will in all probability be shortly brought 
by the steamers from the north of Europe. The animal is 
small, but the flesh, although, like hare, without fat, is very 
much esteemed as a delicacy. The common mode of serving 
it is to cut off the limbs, which are used in soups or stews, 
and to bring only the chine to table, cutting it in long slices 
from head to tail ; it is generally sufficient for a dozen people. 
The fmun, both of the roebuck and fallow-deer, is usually 
carved in the same maimer. 

Kid should be carved in the same manner as lamb when 
kept to be three or four months old ; but as the goat's milk is 
in great esteem, the little animals are usually killed at a few 
weeks old, and are then roasted whole. 

Pork. — In helping the roast loin and leg, your knife must 
follow the direction of the scores cut by the cook upon the 
5kin Avhich forms the crackling, as it is too crisp to be con- 
veniently divided, and cannot therefore be cut across the bones 
3f the ribs, as in loin of mutton. The scores upon the roasted 
leg are generally marked too broadly for single cuts; the 
crackling must in that case be lifted \y^ to allow of thin slices 
being cut from the meat : the seasoning should be under the 
skin round the shank-bone. 

Ham. — Serve it with the back upwards, sometimes orna-

pearance to them. Many 
persons, however, prefer the -^^j^gu---—— -•— — ^

flavour ; it is then carved lengthwise from c to d. 

Soiled Tongue should always be cut crosswise, not going 
through to the fat, which, if required, can be cut by putting 
the knife under. 

Sucking-Fig. — The cook usually divides the body before it 
is sent to table, and garnishes the dish with the jaws and 
ears. 

Separate a shoulder 
from one side, and then 
the leg, according to the 
direction given by the 
line down the middle. 
The ribs are then to be 
divided ; and an ear or 

jaw presented with them. Roast Yw 

and plenty of sauce and 

stuffing. The joints may either be divided into two eacli, or 
pieces may be cut from them. The ribs are reckoned the 
finest part ; but some people prefer the neck end, between the 
shoulders. 

Hare. — Put the point of the knife under the shoulder at Z/, 
and so cut all the way down to the rump, along the sides oi 
the backbone, in the 



line h «, cutting it 
in moderately thick 
slices ; or, after re- 
moving the shoulders 
and legs, cut the back 
crosswise in 4 or 5 
pieces ; but this can 
only be done when the hare is very young or when it is boned^

which you must endeavour to hit, and not to break by force. 
The shoulders may be removed by a circular cut around them ; 
but, although called the " sportsman's portion," are generally 
thought inferior, and are seldom served until the other parts 
have disappeared. The back is the most delicate part, and 
next to that the thighs. A portion of the stuffing should be 
served with each slice. 

The brains and ears of sucking-pig, hare, and rabbit, are 
also considered epicurean tit-bits. When every one is helped, 
cut off the head, put your knife between the upper and lower 
jaw and divide them, which will enable you to lay the upper 
flat on your plate ; then put the point of the knife into the 
centre, and cut the head into two. 

Roast Rabbits. — Proceed as for hare. 

Boiled Rabbits. — The legs and shoulders should be first 

taken off, and then 
the back cut across 
into 2 parts, which 
is easily done by 
placing the knife in 
the joint and raising 
up the back with 
The back, as in the hare, is the best. Some liver 
sauce should always be served with it. 

The carving of winged game and poultry requires more 
delicacy of hand and nicety in hitting the joints than the cut- 
ting of large pieces of meat ; and to be neatly done, requires 
considerable practice.

savoury, and the white part of the wing is preferred by many 
to the fiesli of the breast. The joint of the pinion may be 
found a little below h, and the wing may then be easily re- 
moved without touching the leg. The stuffing is usually put 
in the breast ; but when truffles, mushrooms, or oysters are put 
into the body, an opening must be made into it by cutting a 
circular incision through the apron, at c. 

Soiled Turkey is carved 
in the same way as the roast,

Jie back upwards, put your knife into the bone half way from 
the neck to the rump, and on raising the lower end it will 
sepa.rate readily. Turn the rump from you, take off the two 
sidesmen, and the whole will be done. To separate the thigh 
from the di'umstick of the leg insert the knife into the joint as 
above. It requires practice to hit the joint at the first trial. 
The breast and wings are considered the best parts. 

If the bird be a capon, or large, the breast may be cut into 
slices in the same way as a pheasant.

the breast and wing of the partridge and grouse; but the

The commonly received idea, that wliat goes under the deno- 
mination of "' good plain living " — that is, joints of meat, roast 
or boiled — is best suited to all constitutions, has been proved 
to be a fallacy. Many persons can bear testimony to the truth 
of Dr. Kitchener's remark, that elaborate culinary processes 
are frequently necessary in order to prepare food for the diges- 
tive organs, which are but too frequently taxed beyond their 
power. Indeed, it may be truly said that many persons 
actually lose their lives by over-indulgence in food rendered 
indigestible by being badly cooked. 

Until a comparatively late period the art of cookery was 
almost in a state of infancy, for our ancestors were, with fcAv 
exceptions, content with the most simple, or rather imperfect, 
preparation of their food, and " made dishes " were very little 
known. Of late years, however, it has gradually risen to a 
branch of science, founded on practical experience, combined 
with a knowledge of chemistry ; and the numerous works 
published on its improvement, both in this countrj^ and on the 
Continent, have brought it to a degree of perfection which 
its early professors never expected to attain. This remark 
applies, however, rather more to the cookery of animal than of 
vegetable food ; for, in England, vegetables are chiefly used as 
an accompaniment to meat, while — as will be hereafter shown 
— many delicacies of the kitchen-garden may, if properly 
dressed, be rendered very palatable dishes to be eaten alone. 

It is our intention to endeavour to correct the prejudice in 
favour of a family joint — bv s1iowin2: that the same quantity 
of meat, if dressed in different ways, though still retaining a 
certain degree of simplicity, will be more pleasant to the 



Chap. III. FOOD A^^D COOKERy. 27 

palate, more healthful, and quite as economical, if brought to 
tlie table as two or three dishes instead of one. 

In French cookery, those substances which are not intended 
to be broiled or roasted, are usually stewed for several hours 
at a temperature below the boiling--point ; by which means the 
most refractory articles, whether of animal or vegetable origin, 
are more or less reduced to a state of pulp, and admirably 
adapted for the further action of the stomach. In the common 
cookery of this country, on the contrary, articles are usually 
put at once into a large quantity of water, and submitted, 
without care or attention, to the boiling temperature : the 
consequence of which is, that most animal substances, when 
taken out, are harder and more indigestible than in the natural 
state.

crude English diet is sure to produce discomfort by promoting 
acidity ; while the very same articles, when divided, and well 
cooked upon French principles, or rather the principles of 
common sense, can be taken with impunity, and easily 
digested. 

There are only a few persons — with the exception perhaps 
of those who take violent exercise, or work hard in the open 
air — who can dine heartily upon solid food without suffering 
from its effects. When people sit down to table with a good 
appetite, it is difBcult to persuade them to eat only half the 
quantity for which they feel disposed ; but it is very certain 
that, in order to escape the horrors of indigestion, plain roast 
or boiled meat should be very sparingly consumed. Partly 
upon the erroneous supposition tliat it is the most wholesome 
species of food, and partly to avoid the trouble of providing 
anything else, a whole family, ho\vever various their consti- 
tutions may be, are seated at table before a single joint, to 
take their chance of suffering from the repletion which even 
a small portion may occasion to a delicate person, who could 
have partaken of three or four judiciously-dressed dishes with- 
out sustaining the slightest inconvenience. The stomach, in 
fact, never performs its duties so effectually as when it acts 
upon food composed of nuich variety. Indeed, the united 
testimony of high medical authority proves that a variety of 
"well-dressed food is more easy of digestion, and coiL^equently 
more salutary, than when the meal is confined to one sort of 
solid meat. y/ • 

Foreigners are so well aware of this that they never dine 
on a single dish. Tliey always commence the meal with 
soujj, or rather M'eak potage, followed oy some small dishes of 
meat and vegetables, thoroughly done, and eaten separately ; 
and although they usually eat full as much as the English, 
yet their dinner sits light upon the stomach, without any com- 
plaint of that drowsy sense of indigestion of which we hear so 
much in England that our newspapers are filled m ith adver- 
tisements for its cure. 

In England, cookery in small respectable families, where it 
js necessary to study economy, has also to contend with a 
prejudice concerning the vulgarity of certain viands ; many 
portions of an animal, which in France are in great esteem, 
being rejected in this country upon very insufficient grounds. 
The very coarsest joints may be so refined in the culinary 



Chap. III. FOOD AND COOKEEY. 29 

process as to retain nothing offensive either to the eye or the 
palate, while the vulgarity must consist in the manner in 
which the viands are served, and not in the viands themselves. 
It is the province of the cook to render unsightly objects 
pleasing ; and thus many things may be brought to table in 
diseruise. which vrould not be admissible in their orio-inal forms. 
A good housekeeper will never offer the first essay of her cook 
to her company : the dish should be tried by the family party, 
and not placed before guests until practice has rendered it 
perfect. By this means the chances of failure are in a great 
measure avoided ; and, by not undertaking more than can be 
accomplished, success may be contemplated with some degree 
of confidence. Indeed, if any of the following receipts are 
put into the hands of an intelligent woman, she will find no 
difficulty in carrying them completely into effect. 

The foundation of all good cookery consists in preparing the 
meat so as to render it tender in substance, without extracting 
from it those juices which constitute its true iiavour ; in doing 
tiiis, the main point in the art of making those soups, sauces, 
and made dishes of every sort, which now form so large a 
portion of every well-ordered dinner, as well, also, as in 
cooking many of the plain family joints — is boiling, or rather 
stewing, which ought always to be performed over a slow fire. 
There is, in fact, no error so common among English cooks as 
that of boiling meat over a strong fire, which renders large 
joints hard and partly tasteless ; while, if simmered during 
nearly double the time, with less than half the quantity of 
fuel and water, and never allov/ed to " boil up," the meat, 
without being too much done, will be found both pliant to the 
tooth and savoury to the palate. 

For instance. The common and almost universal dish 
throughout France is a large piece of plainly-boiled fresh 
beef, from which the soup — or '•'' potage^^ as it is there called 
— has been partly made. It is separately served up as 
" houilli,^' accompanied by strong gravy, and minced vege- 
tables, or stewed cabbage. Now this, as dressed in the 
French mode, is always delicate both in fibre and flavour • 
while, in the English manner of boiling it, it is generally 
hard and insipid. The reason of which, as explained by that 
celebrated cook, Careme, who superintended the kitchen of 
George TV., is this : — " The mea.t, instead of being put down 
to boil, as in our method, is there put in the pot with the usual 



30 MODERN DOMESllC COOKERY. Chap. Ill, 

(juantity of cold water, and placed at the corner of the fire- 
place, where, slowly becoming- hot, the heat gradually swells 
the muscular fibres of the beef, dissolving the gelatinous sub- 
stances therein contained, and disengaging that portion which 
chemists term ' osmazome,' and which imparts savour to the 
flesh— thus both rendering the meat tender and palatable, and 
the broth relishing and nutritive; whilst, on the contrary, if 
the pot be inconsiderately put upon too quick a fire, the boil- 
ing is precipitated, the fibre coagulates and hardens, the 
osmazome is hindered from diseno-ag-ino- itself, and thus 
nothing is obtained but a piece of tough meat, and a broth 
without taste or succulence." 

To stew. — This wholesome aud economical mode of cookery 
is not so v/ell understood nor profited by in England as on the 
Continent. So very small a quantity of fuel is wanted to 
sustain the gentle heat which it requires, that this alone should 
recommend it to the careful housekeeper ; but, if properly 
attended to, meat stewed gently in close-shutting vessels is in 
every respect equal, if not superior, to that which is roasted ; 
but it must be simmered only, and in the gentlest manner. 

On the subject of stewing meat the following directions may 
be advantageously adopted : — " Take a piece of boiling-beef, 
with some fat to it, and a little seasoning, but without water, 
gravy, or liquid of any sort. Put it in an earthen jug clo^^rely 
covered, and place that within a large iron or tin jjot filled 
with cold water, and lay it so near the fire as to keep a gentle 
simmer, without letting it boil. It will require several hours, 
according to the weight of the meat, which sliould be stewed 
until quite tender. It loses nothing, and will yield a large 
quantity of the richest gravy, as retaining the whole of its 
juice, and is decidedly the best mode of dressing that universal 
French dish hceuf-bouilliJ" ^ 

To roast in perfection is not only a most difficult but a most 
essential branch of cookery, and can only be acquired by prac- 
tice, though it consists in simply dressing the joint thoroughly, 
without drying up any portion of its juices. If this, however, 
be not strictly attended to, the meat will be spoiled, and the 
error cannot be rectified. 

A brisk, but not too strong, fire should be ma^e up in good 
time, and care taken that it is sufficiently wide to take in the 

■ Transactions of the Royal Society of Agi'icjltui'e, vol. iii. p, 88. 



CiiAP. m. FOOD AND COOKEPtl'. 31 

joint, leaving- two or three inches to spare at each end, and 
that it is of equal strength throughout. The fat should be 
protected by covering it with paper, tied on with twine. The 
meat should not be put very near the fire at first, or the out- 
side will become scorched, dry, and hard, while the inside will 
be underdone ; but it should be put gradually nearer to the 
fire when about warmed through, or it will become soddened ; 
and the screen should be placed behind it from the commence 
ment. The more the meat is basted the better it will be when 
dressed, and the cook should not be sparing of her trouble in 
this respect. She should remove the paper a short time before 
sending the joint to table, sprinkling it with salt, and dredging 
it lightly witli flour, in order to give it a savoury brown ap- 
pearance ; but salt should not be j)ut to it before it is nearly 
dressed, as it would tend to draw out the gravy. 

Meat which lias been fresh killed will take a longer time to 
roast than that which has been kept any time ; and in warm 
weather twenty minutes less time should be allowed for the 
roasting of a good-sized joint than when the weather is cold. 
Time, distance, basting often, and a clear fire of a proper size 
f(3r what is required, are the chief points that a good cook 
should attend to in roasting. 

In preparing meat for roasting by smoke-jack, the cook 
must be careful that the spit be wiped before it is used, and 
also when withdrawn from the meat, or its mark will appear 
in a black stain. She must avoid running the spit through 
the prime parts.^ In some joints, as necks, it may enter two 
bones from the end, run up the back until it comes to nearly 
the other end, and the prime of the meat will not be pierced. 
Leaden skewers of different weights should be in readiness ; 
for want of which unskilful servants are often at a loss at the 
time of spitting. Cradle-spits answer best ; they may be 
bought of different sizes. The joints of all necks and loins 
should be nicked before they are dressed. A piece of writing- 
paper, cut as a frill, should be twisted round the bone at the 
knuckle of a leg or shoulder of lamb, mutton, or venison, 
wlien roasted, before it is sent to table. 

After the cook has taken up the roast meat, she should pour 
the fat from the dripping-pan into a basin previously wetted 
with cold water. The next day she should scrape off the fine

meat-jelly which will be found adhering* to the under part, 
and put it into a suitable vessel for present use, as an assistant 
to gravies. The dripping should then be melted and strained. 
If required to be kept long, it should be strained into cold 
water, and taken off when cold in cakes, and these cakes laid 
in a dry place, between sheets of writing-paper. 

So much depends upon the taste of parties in the mode of 
over or under dressing, that it is difficult to say how long a 
joint of meat of a certain size should be roasted ; but, pre- 
suming that a good fire is kept up, and that the meat ir« 
intended to be well done, a piece of beef — say of 12 to 15 lbs. 
weight — should, in winter, be properly roasted in from 3 to 
3^ hours. The common rule is, ^ of an hour to each lb. ; 
but a thick joint — such, for instance, as a sirloin of beef or 
leg of mutton — will require rather more time than the ribs or 
shoulder ; and meat that has been hung for some days requires 
less roasting than that which has been newly killed ; mutton, 
somewhat less than beef; but veal, pork, and all sorts of 
white meat, should be so thorouglily roasted as not to show 
any appearance of red gravy. 

Some cooks recoiimiend a method of roasting joints of meat 
in a sloto manner^ before a large fire, and placing them at a 
much greater distance from the fire than in the common v/ay ; 
on the principle, as they say, " that it renders tJie meat more 
tender, and better retains the gravy." This, hov/ever, we 
cannot admit ; for it does not retain more of the gravy, and it 
makes the flesh soft and insipid or flabby, instead of imparting- 
to it that degree of crispness which is caused by the ordinary 
mode. It also has the further disadvantage of requiring twice 
the usual time, and occasioning double the expenditure of 
coals. 

To boil. — All meat for boiling should be entirely covered 
with cold water, and placed on a moderate fire, the scum being 
carefully taken off" as it rises, which will be in general a few 
minutes before it boils. This should be done with great care, 
as, if neglected, the scum will sink and adhere to the joint, 
giving it a very disagreeable appearance. The kettle should 
be kept covered. We cannot too strongly urge upon a cook 
the great advantage of gentle simmering over the usual fast 
boiling of meat, by which the outside is hardened and de- 
prived of its juices before the inside is half done. 

Pickled or salted meat requires longer boiling than that 



Chap. III. FOOD AND COOKERY. 33 

which is fresh. A fish-plate, or some ^vooden skewers, should 
be put under a large joint to prevent its sticking to the bottom 
of the boiJ.er. 

To broil. — A cinder-fire, or one partly' made of coke and 
charcoal, clear of all appearance of smoke, is indispensable ; 
and chops, steaks, or cutlets of all kinds — if intended to be 
eaten in their plain state— should be dressed after every other 
dish is ready, and sent up to table last, so as to secure their 
being hot : thus it may be observed that in " steak-dinners " 
the second course is always the best — as being dressed while 
the first is being eaten. The gridiron should be kept so clean 
as to be nearly polished, and should be always warmed before 
the meat is put upon it, as well as greased to prevent the steak 
from being burned. A fork should never be used in turning 
them, but a pair of steak-tongs. 

To fry. — The principle of this art is " to scorch something 
solid in oil or fat." To do this it is necessary that the fat be 
in such condition as to scorch whatever is put into it ; for if 
the substance fried does not bur7i, it must soak and become 
greasy. After the substance is immersed in the fat the pan 
may be removed a little off t]ie fire, as otherwise the outside 
will become black before the inside is done. 

When fried things are required to look particularly well, 
they should be done twice over with e^g and crumbs. Bread 
that is not stale enough to grate quite fine will not look well. 
The fat you fry in must always be boiling-hot when the meat 
is put in, and kept so till finished; a small quantity never 
fries well. 

Suet. — When a sirloin of beef, or a loin of veal or mutton, 
IS brought in, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, 
or to clarify. If there be more suet than Mill be used while 
fresh, throw it into pickle, made in the proportion of i lb. of 
salt to a quart of cold water, and it will be good for any use 
when soaked in cold water a little. 

If the weather permit, meat is much improved by hangino^ 
a day before it is salted. 

Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. 
Cloths for this purpose should be carefully washed, and boiled 
in clean water between each using, and not suflfered to hang 
111 a damp place, which would give a bad flavour to the meat. 
The same applies to tapes and pudding-clotlis. All kitcher 

c3 



34 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. III. 

utensils should be kept in the nicest order, and in a conspi- 
cuous part of the offices. 

The more soups or broth are skimmed, the better and clearer 
they will be. In making- these, as well as in boiling meat, 
particular care must be taken to take the scum off the 7noment 
before the water boils, otherwise the foulness will be dispersed 
over the meat. 

Vegetables should never be dressed with meat, except car- 
rots or parsnips with boiled beef. 

Full-grown meats do not require so much dressing as young ; 
not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten with the 
gravy more in. 

Hashes and Minces should never boil, as their doing so 
makes the meat hard. The gravy should be thoroughly made 
before the meat is put in. 

Dripping, or clarified suet, will serve as well as butter for 
basting everything except fowls and game ; for kitchen pies 
nothing else should be used. 

Mutton-dripping cannot, however, be used in cookery, as 
It is apt to communicate to everything a taste of tallows 

Seasoni?ig. — The art of seasoning properly is a difficult 
one, which can only be acquired by experience. The cook 
tastes her preparations instead of employing the scales ; and, 
where the quantities are indefinite, it is impossible to adjust 
rhe exact proportions of spice or other condiments wnich it 
will be necessary to add in order to give the proper flavour : 
the great art being so to blend the ingredients that one shall 
not predominate over the other. 

In the following receipts, though the quantities of each 
ingredient may be as accurately directed as possible, yet 
much must be left to the discretion of the person w^ho uses 
them. The different tastes of people require more or less of 
the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter, &c., which can never 
be ordered by general rules. A servant anxious to please 
will take all possible pains to ascertain the tastes of those she 
serves, and will be guided by that in the preparation of her 
dishes, though it may be opposed to her previous practice. 
The proper articles should be at hand, and she must propor- 
tion them until the true zest be obtained, and a variety of 
flavour be given to the different dishes. A very general 
error among English cooks is the too profuse use of salt and 



CnAP. III. FOOD AXD COOKEEY. 35 

pepper, by which ragouts and soups are very frequently 
spoiled ; lor although some portion of both must be put in at 
first, to counteract the rawness which would otherwise prevail, 
as most spices require to be submitted to the action of fire in 
order to bring out their true flavour, yet either can be easily 
added by those partakers of the dish who prefer more of one 
or the other; and perhaps the only dishes that should be 
highly seasoned are meat-pies and curries. As a general 
rule, it may be said that no mixture should be made without a 
small portion of salt ; thus, in the flour for pastry, a certain 
quantity, not exceeding a saltspoonful, will be necessary ; but 
the cook must be careful not to exceed the just limit. If 
sprinkled upon meat which is to be fried or broiled, it renders 
it hard. 

Cayenne pepper is in general so unsparingly thrown into 
soups of almost every description, that persons of a delicate 
appetite can seldom eat them. Chili vinegar imparts both 
the heat of cayenne and the flavour of acid, and, if used with 
moderation, forms a good condiment ; but no species of sauce, 
or artificial zest, should supersede that of the meat. Nor 
should they, if liquid, be used until after the meat has been 
stewed : even wine, if put into soup, should not be added until 
nearly the last thing, when a wineglassful will go as far in 
flavouring as a pint if put in at the commencement : if the 
cook has not a nice palate, a cupful of the soup should be 
presented to her mistress to decide upon the necessary addi- 
tional ingredients. But all condiments of a solid nature — 
such as whole peppers, ginger, mace, and cinnamon, or 
savoury herbs, truffles, and mushrooms — require the action of 
fire to draw out their flavour : the cook, therefore, must learn 
by experience the quantity of each which may be necessary. 
She should never forget that the zest imparted to both soups 
and sauces mainly arises from a judicious mixture of the 
articles ^vith which they are seasoned : a well-regulated palate 
in their choice, and -a delicate hand in their distribution, are 
therefore essential in a good cook. 

The follomng maxims for cooks are worthy of beiiig re- 
membered : — 

1. Look clean; be careful and nice in work, so that those 
who have to eat might look on. 

2. Never forget, while prepanYig a dish, that what you pro- 



3G MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. III. 

duce has presently to be eaten, relished, or condemned, to your 
lionour or to your discredit. 

3. Whatever can be tasted during the process of preparation 
must be flavoured by the judgment of the palate. Whatever 
may not be tasted before serving must be done strictly and 
invariably by rule. 

4. Though a rule has been long established, there is no 
reason why improvement or advantageous change should not 
be made. The combinations and changes in cookery by 
means of the same materials are endless, therefore always 
think. 

5. Cooks must please the palate ; but it is necessary they 
should likewise suit the stomach ; want of skill ultimately 
brings upon them reproach instead of praise. 

6. A judicious use of salt will do wonders for the credit of 
a cook. The flavours w^hich result from it cannot be traced 
to a cause ; the cook has therefore the whole of the credit — 
the condiment none. The same applies to the use of condi- 
ments and flavours in general ; whenever a particular "taste 
predominates, the merit is attributed to the ingredient, and 
not to the cook. 

7. The cook who attends to the niceties of the art is a 
superior servant ; but if ignorant or neglectful, is worthless. 

There are three arts very essential in good cooking ; these 
are bo?ii?ig, larding, and braising. They are not diiflcult to 
acquire, so that there is little or no excuse for their neglect in 
the kitchens of private families ; but we maj'' truly assert that 
not one cook in a hundred knows anything of boning, and very 
few of even the simple operation of larding ; if, therefore, the 
family resides in town, the better way is always to have these 
matters performed by the poulterer ; for if a joint of meat — 
as, for instance, a shoulder of mutton — is to be boned, the 
butcher cannot do it so well. 

JB oiling, besides its other advantages, is»particularly recom- 
mended, on account of its economy ; the bones of turkeys, 
fowls, hares, &c., assisting to make gravy, while they are 
nearly useless when left in the bodies of the animals. Hares 
should always be boned, for the sake of the improvement in 
their appearance, and being so much more easily carved. In 
the hiring of a cook by persons resident in the country, it is 
therefore essential to ascertain whether she is mistress of this 



Chap. 111. 



FOOD AND COOKERY, 



37 



art ; for as to teaching her by printed directions, it would be 
time thrown away, and she can only acquire it by practice ; 
but it may be learned by a few lessons from the poulterer. 

Larding should be neatly done to be ornamental ; but nearly 
the same effect, with respect to flavour, may be produced by 
raising- the skin and laying a slice of fat bacon beneath it ; 
and indeed, although it does not improve the appearance, yet 
if the flesh be dry — as in a hare — it has a better effect upon 
the meat. Larding is not only commonly employed on poultry 
and game, but so frequently on many other dishes also, that 
every cook ought to be acquainted with the mode of perform- 
ing it. It is done by cutting the firmest pai't of the bacon-fat 
into small strips, proportioned in length and thickness to the 
size of the article to be larded ; and these " lardoons," as they 
are called, are inserted, in rows, into punctures made in the 
surface of the flesh, by a larding-needle, in one end of which 
the bacon is held. It is, in fact, very simple, requiring only 
practice and perseverance to become an adept.

to the article 
to be done ; cut slices of 
bacon into bits of a proper 
length, quite smooth, and 
put into a larding-needle, 
with which pierce the skin and a very little of the meat, leaving 
the bacon in, and the two ends of equal length outwards. Lard 
in rows at the distance you think fit. 

To braise. — Put the meat to be 
braised into a stewpan, and cover it 
with thick slices of fat bacon ; then lay 
round it six or eight onions, a faggot 
of sweet herbs, some celery, and, if 
to be brown, some thick slices of carrots, 
and any trimmings of fresh meat-bones, 
with a pint and a half of water, or the 
same quantity of stock (directions for 
which will be found under the head of 
Soups and Gravies^, according to what 
the meat is, and add seasoning. Cover 
the pail close, and set it over a slow

stove ; it Avill require two or three hours, according to its size 
and quality. Then strain the gravy ; keep the meat quite 
hot ; take the fiit off by plunging the basin into cold water, 
which will cause the fat to coagulate ; and boil it as qrJckly 
as you can till it thickens. If, however, you wish the gravy 
to adhere to the meat, it must be still further boiled until it 
is sufficiently reduced. 

Many persons have been deterred from attempting this ex- 
cellent method of cooking on account of the expensive way 
usually prescribed. Should there be nothing else at hand, the 
meat or fowl to be braised may be put into a stewpan, with 
about an ounce of fresh butter, or a larger quantity according 
to the size, and a teacupful of water. Stir these together for 
a short time, and shake the pan occasionally until the j'licc^s jf 
the meat or poultry afford sufficient gravy ; put in an onion 
and a bunch of sweet herbs, with a little pepper or other 
seasoning, and a small quantity of salt. The meat nmst be 
turned several times during the period of braising, as the 
English apparatus does not often admit of fire being placed ou 
the top of the stewpan.

and continue boiling until it is reduced to the consistence of

boiling water, and when thoroughly heated, apply it by means 
of a brush to glaze chickens, tongues, and beef.

between the skin and the flesh; or, the breast-bone beiii<y

out, the body is filled. 

Tongues, palates, &c., are said to be blanched, when, after 
long boiling, the skin can be peeled off; palates will become 
thicker by being put into cold water afterwards. 

To keep meat hot. — Take it up when done ; set the dish 
over a pan of boiling water, or in the hain-marie (as described 
in the next Chapter) ; put a deep tin cover over the meat so 
as not to touch it, and then throw a cloth over that. This 
way dries the gravy less than hot hearths of iron. The most 
effectual way of all is in a warm closet, which is now made so 
as to be heated by the steam from the ]3oiler attached to most 
kitchen ranges.

Besides those improved ranges which are famished with 
ovens, boilers, stewing-stoves, and hot-plates, every kitchen- 
grate should be encircled by a large fender and a standard or 
broad plate of iron for the support of small articles to be kept 
warm, and supplied with forks and hooks, fixed to it, for the 
toasting of bread or bacon, and the occasional dressing of a 
nmtton-chop. 

A Cradle-spit has the advantage of enclosing any very 
delicate matter to be roasted, without piercing the flesh, but 
is seldom used but where there is a smoke-jack.

The well-known Bottle ./ac^, which is moved by springs 
wound up like a watch, is very useful for the roasting of 
poultry or small joints, which are done before the fire in a 
shorter time than when spitted in the ordinary way. A nearly 
similar machine, also moved by self-acting springs, has been 
brought forward as an improvement, as it can act on t^\'0 spits 
at the same time. These are both suited to moderate-sized 
fireplaces; but they are thought to have this objection — that 
confining the air has partly the effect of baking tlie meat 
while it is roasting ; and thus, to the palate of a connoisseur, 
destroys much of that savoury flavour which the meat acquires 
when roasted by the smoke-jack ; but this remark applies only

Digesters.— Yaxious steam-kettles, known to cooks as " con- 
jurers," ought to be kept in every kitchen, and used at intervals 
when the fire is not otherwise engaged, Into one of these a 
digester should be placed, containing a quantity of water just 



sufficient to cover the ingredients to be acted upon ; into it 
are to be put all the scraps of meat which are usually thrown 
away, together with the bones of all the meat daily dre&sed 
and consumed — from the bones of a leg of mutton to that of 
a mutton-chop, and those of fowls, whether left upon a dish or 
a plate. 

Fastidious ladies will probably be shocked at the idea of 
again bringing such matters to table, but they should recollect 
that the bones are only scraped with a knife. 

Bones may be purchased from the butchers for a few 
farthings per pound; but if they are cleaned, and trimmed, 
and steamed in the digester, the marrow and sinews of the 
bones produce in a few days a strong and wholesome soup. 
Indeed, economical persons purchase bones of the butcher, and 
by stewing them many hours procure an excellent stock ; siand 
families to whom expense is an object will do well to make 
the experiment. 

Conjurers, though different in appearance, yet act upon the 
same principle by means of steam, and v.ill heat any liquid in 
a few minutes ; but bemg made of tin, they are not so effectual 
as Papiiis Digester , winch is formed of iron, and of such 
power as to extract strong jelly from the bones of meat, and 
to reduce " those of small, young fowls to a pulp."

size, and jSTo. 2 for any quantity from lialf a gallon upwards ; 
the price being- accordirtg to the size. 

The great importance and utility of this valuable utensil, ir 
producing a larger quantity of wholesome and nourishing food 
by a much cheaper method than has ever been hitherto ob- 
tained, cannot be too earnestly recommended to those who 
make economy an object of their attention. 

The chief, and indeed the only thing necessary to be done, 
is to direct a proper mode of using it to most advantage, and 
this mode is both simple and easy. 

Care nmst be taken, in filling the digester, to leave room 
enough for the steam to pass off through the vah'e at the top 
of the cover. This may be done by filling the digester only 
three parts full. It must then be placed near a slow fire, so 
as ojily to simmer, for the space of eight or ten hours, as 
more heat injures the quality. After this has been done, the 
soup is to be strained through a hair sieve or colander, in 
order to separate any bits of bones. The soup is then to be 
again put into the digester; and, after whatever vegetables 
and seasoning are thought necessary are added, the whole is 
to be well boiled together for an hour or two, and it will be 
then fit for immediate use. 

N.P). In putting on the lid of i\\e digester, care should be 
taken that a mark X, on the lid, is opposite to a similar mark 
X on the dio-ester. 

The bain-marie is a very shallow cistern placed on a hot 

hearth, and generally madt 
of copper, for containing 
hot water to keep soups and 
sauces warm, but may occa- 
sionally be used for keeping 
dishes warm. It is tlie best 
mode of keeping anything 
hot which has been suffi- 
ciently dressed, but not 
ready to be sent to table; so tlie dish, if covered and placed in 
it may be thus kept perfectl}'" warm, without being scorched 
as it would be if put before the fire. 

Anything that is to be warmed and sent to table a second 
time should, in like manner, be put into a basin or jar, placed 
in hot water, wliich is not permitted to come to the boiling- 
point. If allowed to boil, the meat will harden, or the sauce

for the warming of plates and dishes, should also form a part 
of the furniture of every kitchen ; and there should be an 
abundance of cooking utensils of the best kind, kept in their 
proper places and strictly clean. Cleanliness is, indeed, of 
the first miportance, and no kitchen-maid should ever put 
away a metal saucepan which has been used for any other 
purpose than merely boiling pure water, without washing it 
thoroughly and then drying it. 

On the Continent many of the most useful kitchen utensils

Are made of or lined witli glazed crockery-ware, and are u.-^ed 
for melting butter, boiling milk, and making sauces ; also 
deep belly-formed jars and pans of different sizes for the 
stewing of meat and making of soups, as being more easily 
kept sweet than those of tin or copper ; and, if the same 
system were more followed in this country', it would secure 
the delicacy of many dishes which are liable to be spoiled by 
being cooked in metal vessels. If copper utensils are used in 
the kitchen, the cook should be charged to be very careful 
not to let the tin be rubbed off, and to have them fresh tinned 
when the least defect appears,'' as w^ell as never to put by any 
soup, gravy, or sauce in tiicm, or in any metal utensil ; stone 
and earthen vessels should be provided for those purposes. 

Every kitchen should be provided with a clock to keep the 
cook to her time ; also with a large and a small marble mortar 
for the pounding of meat, with chopper, meat-saw, various- 
sized scoops for vegetables, when req'nred for haricos, &;c., 
paste-cutters, steak-tongs, &c., and those insignificant, though 
useful little articles, minute-glasses, to regulate the boiling of 
an eg(^; nor should a spice-box, containing whole pepper, 
mace, nutmegs, and cinnamon, be forgotten ; together with 
various dried sweet herbs. As accuracy in apportioning the 

ingredients to be used is in- 
dispensable to the success of 
cookery, scales, with weights 
from i oz. to 2 lbs., should 
be placed on the dresser, 
and the weights carefully 
kept in regular order. A 
set of tin measures with small 
spouts or lips, and vv^ith the 
contents distinctly marked 
upon them, from a gallon 
down to half a gill, v/ili also be found very convenient. It 
is likewise well to have a set of wooden measures, from a 
bushel to a quarter of a peck. 

Let it be remembered, that, of liquid measure — 

Two gills are half a pint. 
Two pints are one quart. 
Four quarts arc one gallon.

Of dry measure — 

Half a gallon is a qt\irter of a peck. 
One gallon is half a peck. 
Two gallons are one peck. 
Four gallons are half a buslu;!. 
Eight gallons are one bushel. 

About twenty-five drops of any thin lie|uid will fill a common-sized tea-

Three tablespoonfuls will fill a common wine-glass. 
Four wine-glasses will fill a half-pint or common tumbler. 
A quart black bottle holds in reality about a pint and a half. 
Ten eggs generally weigh one pound before they are broken. 
A tablespoonful of salt or brown sugar is generally about one ounce. 

Sieves, of various descriptions, are very essential. Every 
utensil for cookery should be of various sizes, so as to suit the 
quantity of which the dishes may be composed ; and each 
should be kept in a jfixed place, as well as AAashed and dried 
immediately after using. The cook sliould also be charged to 
take care of jelly-bags, tapes for collared meats, &c., which, 
if not perfectly scalded and kept dry, give an unpleasant 
flavour when next used.

" According to the English plan, the meat is cut up more 
advantageously for roasting and broiling than by the Scotch. 
For instance, the rump and aitchbone, ISTos. 2 and 3, in the 
first figure, are cut in such a manner that the meat affords 
a much better steak than v/hen cut as in the second. The 
Scotch plan, on the other hand, gives more pieces for boiling ; 
and thus each way seems suitable to the taste of the people 
who have respectively adopted them."

Pork, although from its common use among the lower 
classes of society regarded as a homely viand, is yet held in 
nigh estim.ation by many gentlemen's families, who, living in 
tlie country, rear pigs for their own consumption ; and we 
Know that '• home-fed pork," from Prince Albert's farm at 
Windsor, frequently forms a dish, in tlie winter season, at the 
royal table. 

The usual mode of cutting up the pig is thus :

MARKETING. 

Although respectable butchers may, in most cases, be relied 
apon for the goodness of the meat which they sell to regular 
customers, yet many persons (both ladies and gentlemen) go 
to market and choose for themselves, when, if not competent 
pdges, the inferior sorts generally fall to their lot. In country 
towns, also, there are frequently but one or two market-days 
in the week; it is an essential point of good housekeeping to 
be so well acquainted with the quality as not to be easily im- 
posed upon. 

Formerly both sheep and oxen were reared to a mature age ; 
but graziers have since learned to bring them so early to 



54 MODERiT DOMESTIC COOKEPiY. Chap. VL' 

market, by means of artificial fatting, instead of the more 
natural mode of grass-feeding, that they are now killed at such 
early periods as to deprive the meat of much of its flavour. 
This is more especially the case with regard to mutton, which, 
to be in perfection, should not be less than from 3 to 5 years 
old, whereas now sheep are generally killed at less than half 
that age ; and not unfrequently at 20 months old ! — the con- 
sequence of which is, that they are neither lamb nor mutton. 

There is also great difference in the quality of the flesh of 
large and small animals of both kinds, of which the smaller 
will generally be found to be the best, as being reared upon 
short mountain pasture ; while the Leicesters and other large 
breeds, which are fed upon rich land, become at an early age 
covered with fat. The beef of a small Highland ox, also, 
always fetches the highest price in Smithfield. 

Ox-beef should have a fine smooth open grain, be of a good 
red, and feel tender. The fat should look white rather than 
yellow, for, when that is of a deep colour, the m^eat is seldom 
good : beef fed on oil-cake is generally so, and the flesh is 
flabby. The best is that which is rather more than moderately 
fat, as being a proof that the animal was well fed ; but never 
buy lean beef, as it will always prove tough, and so inferior as 
to be dear at any price. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and 
the fat whiter, than in ox-beef; but the lean is not of so 
bright a red. The grain of bull-beef is coarser and closer still, 
the fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and it has a 
stronger scent. Ox-beef is the richest and largest ; but in 
small families, and to some tastes, heifer-beef is preferred, if 
finely fed. In old meat, a streak of horn runs between the 
fat and lean of the sirloin and ribs ; the harder this is, the 
older, and the flesh is not finely flavoured ; that is to say, 
when the horn has become so firm as to appear like bone : but 
oxen are always the better if kept until 5 or 6 years old. 

Ox-tongue. — A neat's tongue should be of a moderate size, 
plump, firm, and smooth to the touch ; for if the skin appears 
icugh and shrivelled, it will be found hard and flavourless. 

Veal. — A great point to be observed in choosing veal is the 
size of the calf and the colour of the meat. It should be small 
and white, and the kidney well covered with fat. The flesh of 
a bull-calf is firmest and most juicy, but not so white. The 
fillet of the cow-calf is generally preferred for the udder. If 



Chap. VI. MARKETING. 65 

the bloody vein in the shoulder looks blue, or of a bright red, 
it is newly killed ; but any other colour shows it to be stale. 
The other parts should be diy and white ; if clammy or 
spotted, the meat is stale and bad. The kidney turns 'first, 
and the suet ^vill not then be firm. If the calf is older than 
eight or ten weeks, the flesh becomes coarse. It will of course 
be somewhat cheaper, and may, to some palates, be found 
equally good in flavour, but not so delicate either in the colour 
or the texture of the flesh. 

Mutton. — Wether mutton is the only sort for a connoisseur's 
table, and may be known by a knob of fat on the upper part 
of the leg, where, in ewe mutton, is the udder. The meat 
should be of a dark colour, and well covered with fat ; and in 
the loin the lean should appear mottled. The flesh of the ewe 
is paler, and the texture finer, but neither the meat nor gravy 
so well flavoured as that of the wether, though a '•' maiden 
ewe," when it can be got, is considered particularly fine. If 
you wish to have a good haunch, choor>e one of small size and 
moderately fat, looking at the same time to the closeness of 
the grain and the whiteness of the fat ; but more particularly 
see that the flesh is dark-coloured, that being a proof of age, 
and the older mutton is, the better. In boiled mutton tliis is 
not of so much importance as in roast. 

Lamh. — There are tvv'o sorts : " house-lamb," v/hich is 
reared under cover upon ewe's milk, and comes into season, as 
a great delicacy, at Christmas ; and " grass-lamb" at Easter, 
contiiming in season during the whole of the summer, but 
losing much of its nicety of flavour after it reaches 4 months 
old. It ought therefore to be small and white in appearance, 
and weU covered with fat : the younger the more delicate. 

Pork. — The rind should be tliin, the fat very firm, and the 
lean white : the principal point to be observed is the firmness 
of the fat. If the rind is tough, thick, and cannot easily be 
impressed by the finger, it is old. Pigs that are short in the 
legs and bodies, and have thick necks, and not long heads and 
ears, are always to be preferred. AVhen fresh, the flesh will 
be smooth and dry ; if clammy, it is tainted. What is called 
*' measly pork " is very unwholesome, and may be known by 
the fat being full of kernels. Pork fed at distilleries does not 
answer for curing in any way, the fat being spongy. Dair^'"* 
pork is the best. 



56 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. VI. 

Porkers from 3 to 4 months old are the most delicate, and 
6 months is the latest age at which they should be killed as 
such. 

Bacoji. — If the rind be thin, the fat firm and of a reddish 
tinge, the lean tender, of a good colour, and adhering to the 
bone, you may conclude it is good and not old. If there are 
yellow streaks in it, it is rusty. 

Hams. — Stick a sharp knife under the bone, and also up to 
the knuckle. If it comes out with a pleasant smell, the ham 
is good ; but do not buy it if the knife has a bad scent. Hams 
short in the hock are best ; nor should long-legged pigs be 
chosen for any purpose. 

Brawn. — The horny joart of the young brawn will feel 
moderately tender^ and the flavour will be better than the old, 
the rind of which will be hard. 

Venison. — The fat should be clear, bright, and thick ; and 
if the cleft of the haunch be smooth and close, it is young, 
but if the cleft is close and tough, it is old. To judge of its 
sweetness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or 
haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few people like it 
when it has much of the haiU-gout ; but it bears keeping 
better than any other sort of meat^ and if eaten fresh killed it 
is not so good as mutton. Observe the neck of a fore-quarter ; 
if the vein be bluish, it is fresh ; if it have a green or yellow 
cast, it is stale. In the hind-quarter, if there is a faint smell 
under the kidney, and the knuckle is limp, the meat is stale. 
If the eyes be sunk, the head is not fresh. When you can 
learn where it has been reared, choose forest- venison, as that 
is the best ; for some of the dealers stall-feed the deer, and 
fatten them with oil-cake. It should be full 5 years old. The 
buck comes into season in May, and the meat continues in 
prime order until September, when doe-venison is brought into 
use, and continues to Christmas. 

In every sort of provisions the best of the kind goes furthest,' 
cuts up to greatest advantage, and affords most nourishment. 
Round of beef, fillet of veal, and leg of mutton, are joints 
that bear a higher price ; but as they have more solid meat, 
they deserve the preference. It is worth notice, however, that 
those joints which are inferior may be dressed as palatably, 
and, being cheaper, they ought to be bought in turn. 

In loins of meat, the long pipe that" runs by the bone should 



Chap. VI. MARKETING. 



be taken out, as it is apt to taint ; as also the kernels of beef. 
Rumps and aitchbones of beef are often bruised by the blows 
the drovers give the beasts, and the part that has been struck 
always taints : therefore do not purchase these joints if 
bruised. 

All meat should be carefully examined, and wiped with a 
dry cloth as soon as it comes into the house ; and if flies have 
blown upon it, the part must be cut off. This should be daily 
observed until it 's dressed, as it not only tends to preserve the 
meat long in perfection, but prevents that musty flavour too 
often perceived in the outer slice when brought to table. 

In the country, where meat is often carried a great distance, 
it should be well covered up with a cloth, over which fresh 
cabbage-leaves w^ould keep it cool. These cautions are more 
needful, as in some families great loss is sustained by the 
spoiling- of meat. The fly may in some measure be prevented 
by dusting, upon the parts most likely to be attacked, pepper 
and ginger mixed, after ivipi7ig, which should never be 
omitted ; but a more easy and effectual mode is to exclude 
the fly by using a wire meat-safe, or to cover the joints with 
a long loose gauze or thin cloth, and hang them up from the 
ceiling of an airy chamber. 

In summer meat should be wiped every day, or sprinkled 
with pepper to keep ofiJ" the flies ; and should it wear any ap- 
pearance of becoming tainted, it should be brushed over with 
pyroligneous acid ; or even if already slightly infected, either 
the acid or roughly-pounded charcoal, if well rubbed into 
the meat, will restore it. The meat should also be brought 
in early in the morning, as, if much exposed to the sun, the 
heat will render it flabby. In frosty weather, meat is some- 
times in a congealed state, and should be thawed by soaking 
it in cold water before putting it to the fire. 

Meats become more tender, and consequently more digest- 
ible, as well as better flavoured, by hanging ; but veal and 
lamb will not bear it so Ions: as the flesh of older animals. 
In summer, 2 days is enough for lamb and veal, and from 3 to 
4 for beef and mutton ; in cold weather, these latter may be 
kept for more than double that time without risk of being 
tainted. 

To know whether a hare be young, see if the nut of the first 
joint of the fore-paw is tender ; or turn the claws sideways, 
and if they crack the hare is vourig. If the ears are tender 

d3 



^B MODERN DOMESTIC COOKlilllt. Cuav. Vl. 

and pliable, and if the claws are smooth and sharp, the same 
conclusion may be drawn. 

In every sort of fish, stiffness;, redness of the gills, and 
brightness of the eyes, are invariable signs of freshness : thick- 
ness of the flesh generally marks the good condition of all fish, 
and its firmness is an essential requisite. Fisli, when quite 
fresh, curl round, but are particularly elastic, rising immedi- 
ately upon the pressure of the fingers ; and their staleness or 
freshness may be measured by the possibility of making an 
impression. " If stale, the impression will remain ; but, if 
fresh, it will rise again on removal of the pressure." 

Generally speaking, the largest fish are not always the best, 
particularly in cod and haddock, which, when overlarge, are 
frequently woolly : but the smaller ones are not always to be 
preferred, as small salmon, or salmon peel, are always wanting 
in richness ; a moderately-sized turbot, if it be firm, often tastes 
better than some of the very largest. 

Turbot should be thick, and the belly of a yellowish white : 
if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are bad ; the best proof of con- 
dition being in the firmness as well as thickness of the fish, and 
a light cream-colour on the pale side. The best fish average 
from 12 to 20 lbs., though those of less than half that weight 
have a very fine flavour. A fish one day old will dress much 
better than a live one. Brill very much resembles turbot, but 
is narrower and thinner : it requires scaling on both sides, and 
is without those thorny spines which are found on the dark 
side of the turbot. It should be dressed as soon as possible 
after it is caught. 

Soles would appear to be in season all the year round, as 
they are always in the market in greater plenty than any of 
our flat-fish, but are in the highest perfection about midsummer. 
If good, they should be thick, firm to the touch, and the belly 
of a cream-colour ; but if this be of a bluish cast, and the body 
flabby, or the eyes sunken, they are not fresh ; and when 
brought to table, if the spinal bone be in the least degree 
tinged with red, it is a sure sign that the fish is stale. They 
are of all sizes, from a few ounces to a couple of pounds 
weight ; but if much larger, they will be coarse, ■\\'hile the 
very small kinds are all skin and bone. 

To choose a Codfish. — Select a short fish ; the gills should 
r)e very red, and the eyes full and glossy ; for if dull and pale, 
it is a sure sig^n of the fish being stale. It should be round 



Chap. VII. SOUPS— GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 59 



and thick at the neck, from which the body swells and carries 
its fulness nearly down to the tail. It should be perfectly 
stiff, and elastic to the touch; for if, when j^ressed by the 
finger, the mark of the indentation remains, it will eat less 
firm and flaky, and should therefore be rejected. The colour 
of the liver should be of an opaque white cast, and the whiter 
the liver the better the fish: when out of season, the liver be- 
comes red. Many persons consider cod improved by being- 
crimped, as this increases its firmness ; it then requires to be 
kept one day before it is cooked. 

Mackerel. — The eye should be full, and the stripes on the 
back distinctly black : those on the male are straight, those on 
the female are wavy. The male fish is the best. The body 
should be full from the shoulders. 

Salmon. — If fresh and in season, the flesh is of a fine red, 
and the scales silvery ; very firm in the belly, and the whole 
fish stiff. 



CHAPTER VII. 
SOUPS. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 

In England many families deprive themselves of the use of 
soup, arising from fear of its expense. Many of the following 
receipts will, however, be found very economical ; and as 
soups, indeed, add greatly to a family dinner, it would be well 
if every housewife who studies comfort and economy won id 
pay attention to those simple modes of preparing them which 
may be found in the present chapter. 

Roma.7i Catholic families^ who, on fast-days, require maigre 
soups and dishes, will find abundance of receipts in this work ; 
but where they are not strictly so, by suet or bacon being 
directed to be used in stuffings, the cook must use butter 
instead ; and where meat gravies (or stock, as they are called) 
are ordered, those made of fish must be adopted, though butter, 
arrow-root, or flour mixed up with a finely minced or pounded 
anchovy and made into a paste, will make an excellent sub» 
stitute 



60 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. VIL 

Although the English taste is in favour of strong, rich, and 
highly-flavoured soups, yet those may be varied by others of 
a plainer description — broths, rather than soups, containing 
9nly the pure juices of the meat, seasoned with vegetables ; 
iind, thickened with bread, rice, or vermicelli, will be found 
both palatable and \vholesome. Housekeepers will do well to 
attend very closely to this branch of the culinary art, as the 
stock, or broth, may frequently be produced without the pur- 
chase of meat solely for the purpose. Thus the water in 
which a neck or a leg of mutton has been boiled, or the liquor 
from a calf s head, will, with the addition of a little seasoning, 
form a good stock for a vegetable or thick soup ; particularly 
if the bones be added when the meat is brought from table, 
they will produce a stiif jelly, and make quite sufficient soup 
for a small family. 

Arrow-root, or the mere farina or flour of the potato, is far 
better for the thickening of soups than wheaten flour. 

Tlie trimmings of large joints of butcher's meat, the shanks 
of legs and shoulders of mutton, the remains of all sorts of 
poultry and game, the bones of roast meat, or, if boiled, then 
broken and broiled, should all be stewed down to a jelly — 
nor should the bones and remains of fish be neglected for the 
same purpose — and when strained and well seasoned, kept as 
stock for the foundation of soups, which may thus be prepared 
on sudden occasions in a much shorter time than if made from 
raw meat. 

In Scotland, sheep's heads and trotters are much used in 
soup ; and English private families would do well to make 
more use of them, as they afford very strong jelly, and the 
proper flavour may be given by the judicious addition of beef, 
game, ham, and anchovy. A clear jelly of coivhecls is like- 
wise very useful to keep in the house, being a great improve- 
ment to soups and gravies, as well as particukrly nourishing 
for weakly persons. 

Soft water should always be used for making soup, unless 
it be of green peas, in which case hard icater better prescj^ves 
the colour; it is a good general rule to apportion a quart 
of water to a pound of meat, that is to &dij, flesh without bone ; 
but rich soups may have a smaller quantity of water. 

Meat for soup shoi^ld never be drowned at first in water, 
but put into the kettle with a very small quantity and a piece 
of butter, merely to keep the meat from burning until Jjie 



Chap. VII. SOUPS— GENERAL OBSEBVATIONS. 61 

juices are extracted ; by which means of stewing- the gravy 
will be drawn from it before the remainder of the water is 
added. A single pound will thus afford better and richer soup 
than treble the quantity saturated with cold water ; but it will 
take 6 or 8 hours to extract the essence from a few pounds of 
raw beef. Bouilli beef is rendered very rich and palatable, 
though a considerable quantity of soup may be made from it, 
by being stewed at first in a little butter and some of its own 
gravy. 

Soup, if meant to be good, should be made of meat that has 
not been previously cooked ; for although family soup of fair 
quality may be made in the manner above stated, yet, if cold 
meat be used, it will ever be found to have a vapid taste which 
seasoning cannot disguise, nor impose upon the palate of any 
person who is accustomed to broths made from raw meat : but 
we admit that, if only partially employed, the remains of roast 
beef, or the bones broiled, and a shank of ham, will commonly 
improve the flavour of soups made in the usual manner. The 
sediments of gravies that have stood to be cold should likewise 
be avoided, as they occasion the soup to become cloudy. Eaw 
vegetables, with the exception of onions, should not be put 
on to stew at the same time as the meat, as their flavour 
will be exhausted by too long boiling, and the different sorts 
should be put in at different times. Onions, either whole or 
sliced and fried, at once ; pot-herbs, carrots, and celery, 3 
hours afterwards ; and turnips, vegetable marrow, asparagus- 
tops, and those of any delicate kind, only shortly before the 
soup is ready. 

A common camp-kettle will be found an excellent utensil 
for making soup, as the lid is heavy 
and will keep in the steam. An earthen 
pipkin or jar of this form, if of a long 
and narrow make, Avidening a little in 
the centre, is perhaps one of the best 
vessels for soups, and universally used 
by foreign cooks, who insist " that it 
renders the gravy more clear and 
limpid, and extracts more savour from 
the meat, than when made in tin or 
copper." 

It is generally thought desirable to prepare soup the day 
before it is wanted, as the fat can be more easily taken off 




62 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII. 

when cold than hot, and every particle of it should be skimmed 
from the surface, or it will render the broth unpalatable. 
"When put away to cool it should be poured into a freshly 
scalded, and thoroughly dried, earthen pa7i — which is jDrefer^ 
able to any metal — and, when to be kejDt for some days, occa- 
sionally simmered for a few minutes over the fire, to prevent 
its becoming- " mothery " or mouldy. 

A common mistake in making soup is that of allowing it to 
boil too fast, and for too short a time ; long and slow boiling 
is necessary to extract the strength from the meat, which, if 
boiled fast, over a large fire, becomes hard, and will not give 
out its juices. 

If colouri?ig be wanted, a few slices of meat laid at the 
bottom of a stewpan with 2 or 3 oz. of butter, and left on 
the stove until the gravy is entirely drawn out, and nearly 
dried up again, will have the effect of browning; or even 
a piece of bread toasted as brown as possible — but not 
blackened — and put into the soup to simmer for a short time 
before it is served, will generally be found sufficient : if not, 
take an ounce or two of 77ioist sugar — the coarser the better; 
put it into a small saucepan, with a piece of butter the size 
of a walnut ; melt together, add a glass of ketchup, and stir it 
well. A very small quantity may be made in an iron spoon. 
Burnt onions will materially assist in giving a fine browii 
colour to soup, and also improve the flavour without either 
butter or ketchup.'' If colouring is meant to be kept for future 
use, it should be made in the following way : — 

Put 4 oz. of lump sugar, a gill of water, and ^ oz. of the 
finest butter, into a small iron frying-pan, and set it over a 
gentle fire. Stir it with a wooden spoon, till of a bright 
brown. Then add ^ pint of water; boil, skim, and when 
cold bottle and cork it close. Add to soup or gravy as much 
of this as will give a proper colour. 

The colour of ivhite soups may likewise be improved by 
tne use of ivhite roiix, which, in France, is universally added 
to white soups and sauces, as it is more delicate than butter 
and flour mixed in the common way. 

To Clarify Soup. — Break the white of an q^^ into a basin 
along with the broken shell, carefully avoiding the smallest 

^ They are prepared in France, and are to be purchased at all the Italian 
warehouses ia London. 



Chap. YIl. SO UFS— GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 63 

purticle of the yolk ; beat the white to a stiff froth, and mix 
it gradually but thoroughly with the soup, which should be 
set over the fire and stirred till it boils up : then take it off, 
cover it close, and let it stand for i of an hour, then strain it 
through a napkin. The process of clarifying destroys some- 
what of the savour of the soup, which ought, therefore, to be 
more highly seasoned. 

It is very usual to put force-meat balls, of various sorts, 
into many different soups, for the purpose of improving their 
flavour and appearance. Some of these are called " Passover 
balls," as being much in use among the Jews, who are known 
to be excellent cooks, and they are equally applicable to any 
kind of soups — whether meat, fish, or vegetable — and excellent 
in quality. See Force-meat, Chap. XIX. 

Ketchups and sauces, such as soy, anchovy, &c., should 
either only be put into weak soups which require to have some 
flavour imparted to them, or used with great delicacy. There 
is, however, an agreeable acidity as well as a delicacy of 
savour in Harvey's, the Brighton, Reading, Lopresti's, and 
other lately invented sauces, and more particularly in that 
just brought forward as Wardpoy's sauce, which has a singular, 
delicate, though very pungent, flavour. Soups also, which are 
made from calf s-head, cow-heel, and ox-tail, being rich, but 
flavourless, will bear the addition of sauces when other relish- 
ing articles are not at hand ; but, generally speaking, common 
English cooks are too much addicted to the indiscriminate use 
of ketchups and pickles. 

A bunch of Herbs, when spoken of for soups, gravies, &c., 
consists of parsley, thyme, and green onions ; when called 
Seasoning, it is these with about 3 bay-leaves, 6 cloves, a 
blade or two of mace, common pepper, and salt. 

There is sometimes a great prejudice against the use of par- 
ticular sorts of seasoning and spices. Garlic is amongst 
these ; and many a dish is deprived of its finest flavour for 
want of a moderate use of it. The pungency might easily be 
reduced by boiling it repeatedly in different waters. 

The use of tomatas, which are only rarely employed in 
England, would also be found a great improvement in many 
kinds of soup ; and the seeds of celery may be used to give 
flavour when the root is out of season. 



64 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Vn. 

GENER.VX, DIRECTIONS RESPECTING SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

Freshly killed meat is the best for soup ; and the leaner the 
better. 

When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoiled before 
it is wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which will pre- 
serve it 2 days longer ; but the gravy is best when the juices 
are fresh. 

When soups or gravies are to be kept, they must be boiled 
up and put into fresh-scalded dry pans. Do not use the sedi- 
ments of gravies that have stood to be cold, nor any drippings 
but those of beef. Whatever has vegetables boiled in it is 
apt to turn sour sooner than the juices of meat. 

If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in 
boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate ; but if 
strong, cover the stewpan close. If they want flavour, the 
gravy from spiced and hunter's beef, or most of the jDrepared 
sauces, will give it to meat-soups ; and herring-brine, or 
anchovy, with walnut ketchup and soy, will add it to those of 
fish ; but these must be used cautiously. 

When fat remains on any soup, a teacupful of flour and 
water mixed quite smooth, and boiled in it, Avill make it rise 
as scum, when it may be taken off. 

If richness or greater consistency be wanted, a good lump 
of butter mixed with flour, and boiled in the soup, will give 
either of these qualities. 

Long boiling is necessary to give the full flavour of the 
ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups and 
gravies. Skim frequently and simmer slowly ; but do not let 
the broth cool until it is completely made. 

Be sparing in the use of pepper, salt, and spices. 

If onions are too strong, boil a turnip with them, and it will 
render them mild. 

Do not keep either soups or gravies in any vessel of tin or 
copper; and in stirring cioup, do it always with a wooden 
spoon. 



MEAT-SOUPS. 

The basis of all well-made soups is composed of vvhat our 
English cooks call " Stock" or broth, made from all sorts 



Chai'. VII. 



MEAT-SOUPS. 



65 



of meat, bones, and the remains of poultry or game ; all of 
which may be put together 




Boil- 



and stewed down in the 

'• Stock-pot ;" the contents of 

which are, by the French, 

termed Coiisornme. 

This is chiefly used for the 

preparation oi brown or gravy 

soups : that intended for white 

soups being rather differently 

compounded, though made in 

nearly the same manner. 
The following are the most 

usual modes of making it ; the ^ StocJr-pot. 

more succulent the meat, the better will be the stock. 

ing water should be used when the meat is fried, but otherwise 

cold water is best. 

Brown Stock. — Put 10 lbs. of shin of beef, 6 lbs. of 

knuckle of veal, and some sheep's-trotters or a cow-heel, into 

a closely-covered stewpan, to draw out the gravy veiy gently, 

and allow it nearly to dry up until it becomes iDrown. Ther 
pour in sufficient boiling water to entirely cover the meat, anf^' 
let it boil up, skimming it frequently ; seasoning it with whole 
peppers and salt, roots, herbs, and vegetables of any kind. 
That being done, let it boil gently 5 or 6 hours, pour the 
broth from off the meat, and let it stand during the night to 
cool. The following morning take off the scum and fat, and 
put it away in a stone jar for further use. 

Or: — Put into a stewpan a piece of beef, a piece of veal, 
an old fowl, some slices of ham or bacon, and all the trim- 
mings of meat that can be obtained ; add to these materials, 
where such things are abundant, partridge, grouse, or other 
game, which may not be sufficiently young and tender for the 
spit. Put a little water to it, just enough to cover half the 
meat, and stew very gently over a slow fire or steam apparatus. 
When the top piece is done through, cover the meat with 
boiling water or broth ; season with spices and vegetables ; 
stew all together for 8 or 10 hours in an uncovered stewpan ; 
skim oft the fat, and strain the liquor through a fine sieve, or 
" tammy." 

Brown stock may be made from an ox-cheek, ox-tail, 
brisket, flank, or shin of beef; which will, either together or 



66 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII. 

separately, make a strong jelly if stewed down with a piece of 
ham or lean bacon, in the proportion of h lb. to every 7 lbs. 
of meat ; but the shin of beef alone will afford a stronger and 
better flavour. 

This stock may also be reduced to a glaze by boiling the 
skimmed liquor as fast as possible in a newly-tinned stewpan, 
until it becomes of the desired consistence and of a good 
brown colour; taking care at the same time to prevent it 
from burning.* 

JFor a cheap and good Broivn Gravy. — Slice 3 onions, and 
fry them in butter a nice brown ; toast a large slice of bread 
a considerable time, till quite hard and very brown, but not 
burnt. Set these, and any bit of meat, or bone of a leg of 
mutton, &c., and some herbs, on the fire, with water in pro- 
portion, and stew till the gravy is thick and rich : add salt 
and pepper, strain off, and keep cool. 

BR JFJV GRA VY SO UP. 

1. — The meat used for making this soup should be quite 
fresh, and of the common gravy beef: if the shin be used, 
break the bones, as the marrow will add to its richness. 

Take 7 to 8 lbs. of the meat, cut a small portion of it into 
thick pieces, and put it, with 3 or 4 large sliced onions, into a 
close stewpan, with a little butter, until fried to a fine brown. 
That done, add a shank of ham, just cover the meat with cold 
water — say a couple of quarts — and let it simmer by the fire 
for at least 3 hours ; during which time it should not be 
allowed to boil, but, when coming to that point, check it with 
cold water, and skim it. As the pores of the meat will then 
be opened and the gravy drawn, throw in 3 quarts of warm 
water, along with a handful or i oz. each of black pepper, 
allspice, and salt, as well as a bundle of sweet herbs, a few 
cloves, a couple of shalots, 2 or 3 middling-sized carrots and 
turnips (the latter an hour afterwards), together -with 2 heads 
of celery, and allow the whole to boil slowly until the meat 
is done to rags, and the vegetables become tender. Then 
strain it off, and let it stand during the night. Remove the 
fat on the following day, set any portion of it on the fire an 
hour before dinner, and, when thoroughly heated, season it 
with mushroom or walnut ketchup, and send it up with a 

* Glaze may be had at most of iJ^e oil-shops \n London, 



CnAr. VII. IMEAT-SOUPS. 67 

plate of toasted bread, cut into small square pieces, without 
crust. 

You will thus form a gallon to 5 or 6 quarts of strong soup, 
according to the quality of the meat ; but as it is a winter 
soup, and will bear keeping, if served at more than one time 
the flavour may be varied by the addition of different sorts of 
ingredients — as, for instg,nce, plain gravy, gravy and vegeta- 
bles, and vermicelli. 

CLEAR GRAVY SOUP 

2. — Is made from solid lean beef, in the proportion of 1 pint 
of water to 1 lb. of m^eat and 2 oz. of ham, according to the 
instmctions already given ; strain it through a napkin, to free 
it from the shreds of meat and vegetables. Boil the vegetables 
separately a few hours before dinner, in a portion of the broth, 
and add them to the soup. When soup is sufficiently boiled 
on the first day, all that it requires on the second is to make it 
thoroughly hot. Many persons prefer boiling all the vegeta- 
bles in the soup on the first day, thinking that they improve 
its flavour. This may be done in common soup that is not to 
be strained, but should never be done if you vv^ish it to be very 
bright and clear. 

It may be seasoned as in No. 1 , and should be of a clear 
amber colour, without any artificial browning ; but if wanted 
of a deep colour, a burnt onion will suffice. 

This soup is, in fact, the foundation of all those made from 
beef : the great secret of making it being, " not to spare the 
meat," and to boil it slowly. 

31 A CAR ONI SO UP. 

3. — Take a quart of gravy soup ; break 2 oz. of Naples 
macaroni into pieces of little more than an inch long, putting 
them, by degrees, into a small portion of the boiling soup, to 
prevent them from sticking together, and let them boil until 
quite tender, but not soft or pulpy — from 15 to 20 manutes if 
quite fresh, but nearly ^ an hour if at all stale. Vermicelli is 
used in the same manner. They will improve the consistence 
of the soup if the quantity above stated be added ; but it is 
useless, and does not look well, to see, as at some tables, only a 
few strings of it floating in the tureen. The flavour will also 
be much improved if a small quantity of Parmesan cheese be 
either melted in it. or grated and served up separately.

SAGO SOUP 
4. — Take gravy soup, quite clear and brown ; add to it a 
sufficient quantity of sago to tliicken it to the consistence of 
pea-soup, and season it with soy and ketchup ; to which may 
be added a small glass of red wine. It may also be made, as 
a iviiite soup, of beef, by leaving out the soy and ketchup, and 
using white wine, adding a little creajii and mace. 

OX-TAIL SOUP. 
6. — Cut up 2 ox-tails, separating them at the joints; fry 
them with a little butter, together with 4 lbs. of gravy beef, a 
carrot, turnip, 3 onions, a leek, a head of celery, and a bunch 
of sweet herbs, adding a bay -leaf. Add a pint of water and 
a teaspoonful of peppercorns ; set it over the fire, stirring it 
frequently until the pan is covered with a glaze. Fill up the 
stewpan with 3 quarts of water, stirring it occasionally. 
When it boils set it on the stove and let it simmer until the 
tails are quite tender ; then trim the tails, and put them aside. 
Cut some turnip and carrot in fancy shapes, about ^ pint of 
the two together, 2 dozen of button onions, and a head of 
celery : boil all these in a little of the soup until quite tender ; 
strain off the soup through a fine napkin, add the vegetables 
and the tails, season with a little salt and a small piece of 
lump sugar. When thickened ox-tail soup is required, add a 
little brown roux. 

OX-CHEEK SOUP. 

6. — Clean and soak well half an ox-head, which should be 
broken up by the butcher ; take the meat from the bones, and 
put it into an earthen pan with 3 onions sliced and fried 
brown in butter, without becoming burnt ; a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; allspice, pepper, and salt, a large spoonful of each. 
Lay the bones close on the meat, and pour on 3 or 4 quarts of 
water, or a quart of water to every pound of the cut meat. 
Cover the pan with coarse brown paper, tie it closely, and let 
it stand in the oven 3 or 4 hours ; or put it by the side of the 
fire, in a covered pot, until the meat is tender ; when done, 
take out the bones, and pour the soup and meat into a pan. 
When it is to be used, take off the fat, and, having warmed 
the soup, cut the meat into pieces not larger than a mouthful ; 
make the brains into forcemeat balls : and as the soup, though 
excellent in its kind, is not of a very delicate nature, it should 
be highly seasoned with walnut-ketchup, and cayenne, or chili 



CiU?. Vll. MEA'f-SOUPS. 69 

vinegar, coupled with a clove of garlic, and a good-sized glass 
of madeira or port wine, or a large tablespoonful of brandy. 
A little celery, carrot, and tnrnip, if minced small and boiled 
in a basin of it a short time, will improve the flavour. Either 
ox-cheek, ox-tail, or shin of beef will make strong jelly, if 
stewed down until reduced to a pulp, and the bones broken 
up ; a process which will be more effectually performed in the 
digester than in any other vessel. 

FAMILY SOUP, 

7. — Take a shin or leg of beef that has been newly killed ; 
the fore-leg is best, as there is the most meat on it. Have 
it cut into 3 pieces, and wash it well. To each pound allow 
somewhat less than a quart of water ; to 10 lbs. of the leg 

2 gallons of water. Put it into a large pot, and add i a 
tablespoonful of salt. Hang it over a good fire, full 8 hours 
before you dine. When it has come to a hard boil, and 
the scum has risen (which it will do as soon as it has boiled), 
skim it well ; then set it on hot coals in the corner, and 
keep it simmering steadily, so as to continue a regular heat. 
About 3 hours afterwards, put in a couple of heads of celery, 
4 carrots cut small, and as many onions sliced and fried, with 
either a very small head of cabbage cut into little pieces, or 
a large one whole, if to be eaten with the meat ; or, if you 
have any objection to cabbage, substitute a larger proportion 
of the other vegetables, or else tomatas instead. Put in a 
bunch of herbs, tied up in a thin muslin rag. It will require 
at least 8 hours' cooking ; the vegetables should be put in 

3 hours after the meat, and the turnips only ^ an hour before 
it is done. If you wish to send any portion of the meat to 
table, take the best part of it out of the soup about 2 hours 
before dinner ; let the remainder be left in the pot till you 
send up the soup, which must be strained. 

Next day, take what is left of the soup, put it into a pot 
and simmer it for ^ an hour : a lon9:er time Avill weaken the 
flavour. If it has been well made, and kept in a cool place, 
it will be found better the second day than the first. 

If the family is small, and the leg of beef large, it may 
furnish soup for several successive days. Half tlie leg may 
therefore be sufficient, previously breaking to pieces all the 
bones with a mallet or kitchen cleaver, which by causing them 
to give out their marrow will greatly enrich the rjoup. 



70 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII, 

Or : — When a large quantity of any butcher's meat is 
brought in for the use of the family, the joints will require 
trimming: take all the parings, adding a slice or two oi 
bacon, beef or mutton bones, with an oJd fowl, or a rabbit, it 
you have one, turnips, and all sorts of vegetables, onions, 
herbs, a few slices of carrot, a little ketchup, pepper, salt, 
&c. ; put a piece of butter at the bottom of the pan, cover it 
closely, and put it over a slov/ fire for a few minutes, shaking 
tlie saucepan occasionally. Then pour in boiling water, and 
let it stew until it is rich ; apportioning the water to the quan- 
tity of meat. If there be any solid portion of beef, of which 
the soup is made, let it be taken out previous to the meat 
being " done to rags," and sent up along with the roots in 
some of the liquor, thickened and flavoured with any piquant 
sauce : it will form an excJellent stew. 

These receipts constitute the standing household dish so 
well known in France as i\\Q pot au feu. 

Cheap and wholesome pottages, in common use among the 
middle classes in various parts of Europe, are also made in 
diffisrent modes, a few of which are these : — 

COTTAGE SOUP. 

8. — Take 2 lbs. of lean beef, cut into small pieces, with 1 lb. 
of bacon, 2 lbs. of mealy potatoes, 3 oz. of rice, carrots, tur- 
nips, and onions sliced, or leeks and cabbage. Fry the meat, 
cabbage, and onions in butter or dripping, the latter being the 
most savoury ; and put them into a gallon of water, to stew 
gently over a slow fire for 3 hours, putting in the carrots at 
the same time, but the turnips and rice only time enough to 
allow of their being well done ; and mashing the potatoes, 
which should be then passed through a colander : season only 
with pepper and salt : keep the vessel closely covered. It will 
make 5 pints of excellent soup at the cost of about \s. 8d. 

Or : — To any quantity or kind of broth, add whatever vege- 
tables may be in season, and stew them gently till quite tender. 
Then strain the soup ; thicken it with flour and water, to be 
mixed gradually while simmering; and, Avhen that is done, 
and seasoned to your taste, return the vegetables to the soup, 
and let it boil well for ^ an hour. 

SCOTS KAIL

IS only used when mutton cannot conveniently be had. 3 of

4 lbs. of meat should be put to a gallon of cold water, along 
with 2 oz. of pearl-barley, v/ith leeks or onions, and allowed 
to stew until tender ; if salted, put the meat into water over 
night, changing it once before boiling. Then have ready 
the hearts of 2 cabbages cut small, or greens, if cabljages 
are not in season ; put them into the broth, v/hich must be 
allowed to boil up uncovered until reduced to 2 quarts. It 
should only be seasoned with pepper and salt ; but will be 
much improved by the addition of a couple of onions fried 
in butter; indeed, both carrots and turnips are also some- 
times used, but their addition deprives the soup of the title of 
" Kail," which is derived from the greens which are usually 
employed. 

The meat is served witli the soup, and, in like manner as 
the olla of the Spaniards, or the pot au feu of the French, is 
the standing household dish among the middle classes in Scot- 
land. 

C CK'A-LEEKIE— 

10. — In Scotland called ^^ cochj-leeky" — is there a very 
ancient dish, and is recorded to have been a special favourite 
•with James I. Stew a large fowl, a marrow-bone, and 2 or 3 
lbs. of beef, with 2 or 3 Scotch pints (4 to 6 quarts) of water, 
and the \vhite ends of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks, cut in pieces. 
Just before serving, add ^ lb. of prunes, which serve with the 
soup and the fovvd ; but not the meat or marrow-bone, which, 
when put to boil, must be divided. 

Or I — Put 7 lbs. of the upper end of a leg of beef, and an 
old fowl, in a pot, with water enough to cover it, the white 
parts of 2 or 3 dozen of leeks half-boiled and sliced, and 1 lb. 
of prunes. Stew till the meat be tender, skimming it well ; 
the fowl may be disjointed and sent up in the soup. The 
leeks should be blanched, and so many used as to thicken the 
S'^up ; but no other seasoning is usually employed than salt 
and allspice, with a small quantity of mace. 

MUTTON-BR O TH. 

1 1 . — ^The best part for making broth is the chump end ot 
the loin, but it may be made very good from the scrag end of 
the neck only, which should be stewed gently until it becomes 
tender, fully 3 hours, or longer if it be large, but not boiled to 
rags. A few grains of v.hole pepper, with a couple of fried 
onions and some *nrnips, should be put along Avitli the meat 



t* 



12 moderns" COMSSTIC COOKEBY. Chap. Ttt. 

ail hour or two before sending- up the broth, which should be 
- strained from the vegetables, and chopped parsley and thyme 
be mixed in it. The turnips should be mashed, and served 
in a separate dish, to be eaten with the mutton, with parsley 
and butter, or caper-sauce. 

If meant for persons in health, it ought to be strong, or it 
will be insipid. Cooks usually skim it frequently; but if 
given as a remedy for a severe cold, it is much better not to 
remove the fit, as it is very healing to the chest. 

Another way ^ for an Invalid. — Boil 3 lbs. of the scrag end 
of a neck of mutton, cut into pieces, in 3 quarts of water, with 
2 turnips and a tablespoonful of pearl barley or rice. Let it 
boil gently for 3 hours, keeping it cleanly skimmed. Serve 
Avith bits of toasted bread. 

SHEErS-HEAD SOUP. 

1 2. — Have the head carefully cleaned, put it into a stewpan 
with a little water, and when it is heated through fill up the 
pot. When it is sufficiently tender, take it up, remove the 
meat from the bones, and return the bones into the broth, 
adding onion, sweet-herbs, &c., as before directed. The head 
and trotters may also be put witli some vegetables into an 
eartlien jug, containing -J a gallon of water ; cover it close up, 
and bake it ; cut the meat from the bones, when sufficiently 
tender, and put it in small pieces into tlie soup, or serve up 
the head and trotters separately, either whole or with the meat 
cut off and made into a stew. 

In Scotland the head is usually singed with a red-hot iron 

to remove the wool, but without burning or otherwise injuring 

the skin. The head is then soaked during the night, washed, 

scraped, and split ; the brains taken out, and either fried or 

made into forcemeat balls, and the head stewed in the broth 

till tender. 

JBARLEY BROTR. 

1 3. — Take ^ a pint of pearl-barley, boil it in a gallon of 
water gently for ^ an hour, then take 3 lbs. of lamb or mutton 
chops, with the fat cut off, or lean beef; put them into a 
separate ste^vpan with a small quantity of water, add any 
kind of vegetables — carrots, turnips, small onions, celery, and 
green peas if in season — salt and pepper ; when tender add 
these to the water and barley, let the whole boil gently for 2 
bours or longer, and serve it up all together. 



Chap. VII. MEAT-SOUPS. 73 

Or : — Take 3 quarts of good broth, cut into it 2 carrots, 3 
or 4 turnips, 2 heads of celery, a lettuce, a little parsley, 
and some small onions. Stew until the vegetables become 
quite tender ; add to this a few spoonfuls of rice, boiled 
separately ; put the whole together, and boil for I of an 
hour. 

SCOTCH BROTR. 

14. — Set on the fire 4 ounces of pearl-barley, with 3 Scotch 
pints (or 6 quarts) of salt water : when it boils, skim it, and 
add what quantity of salt beef or fresh brisket you choose, and 
a marrow-bone or a fowl, with a couple of pounds of either lean 
beef or mutton, and a good quantity of leeks, cabbages, or 
savoys ; or you may use turnips, onions, and grated carrots. 
Keep it boiling for at least 4 or 5 hours ; but if a fowl be 
used, let it not be put in till just time enough to bring it to 
table when well done, for it must be served up separately. 

Or : — Take the chops from a neck of mutton ; cut the re- 
mainder up in small pieces, and let it stew the whole day. 
Boil ^ a pint of Scotch barley till tender, strain it dry ; chop 
fine 2 large onions and turnips, which put with the barley and 
chops into a close stewpan, strain the broth into it, let it boil 
1^ hour, and skim it well, seasoning it only v/ith salt an^ 
black pepper. This will make a large tureen of broth, besides 
preserving the chops for table. 

HOTCR-POTCR. 

15. — Take any quantity of lamb-chops, pare off the skin 
and greater part of the fat, trim the bones, cut the smaller end 
of the chops into pieces, put in whole into a stewpa,n in this 
manner : — A layer of chops at the bottom, covered with veget- 
ables cut in small pieces, onions, celery, lettuce, carrots, tur- 
nips, and green peas ; put alternately a layer of chops and 
vegetables until the whole are added ; cover tliem with water, 
and let it stew several hours very gently, until both the meat 
and vegetables become tender, and the soup thick. 

Scotch Hotch-potch is made in the same manner, only that 
both beef and mutton are indiscriminately used, and minced 
instead of being left in chops. 

FEPPER-P O T RO TCR-P O TCR. 
16. — To 3 quarts of water put vegetables according to tiie 
season. In summer, peas, French beans, cauliflowers, lettuce, 



74 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VIZ. 



and spinach ; in winter, beet-root and endive,^ carrots, turnips, 
celery ; and onions in both ; all cut small ; and stew with 
2 lbs. of neck of mutton, or a fowl and 1 lb. of pickled pork. 

On first boiling, skim. Half an hour before serving, add a 
lobster or crab, cleared from the bones. Season Vvith salt and 
cayenne. A small quantity of rice should be put in with the 
meat. Some people choose very small suet dumplings boiled 
with it. Should any fat rise, skim nicely, and put ^ a cup of 
tlour and water. 

It may be made of various things, usmg a due proportion of 
fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables, and pulse. In the West Indies it 
is the universal dish of the coloured people ; but seasoned so 
highly Avith green capsicums and peppers, that it is there called 
* pepper-pot.' 

HABRICO SOUP. 

17. — Cut some mutton cutlets from the neck; trim and fry 
them of a light brown ; stew in brown gravy soup till tender. 
Have ready some carrots, turnipe, celery, and onions; fry 
them in butter for some time, and clear the soup from the fat ; 
then add the vegetables, colour it, and thicken it with butter 
and flour ; season, and add to it a little port wine and ketchup. 
If the gravy be ready, the soup will require no more time to 
prepare than may be necessary to render the chops and vege- 
tables tender, and is an excellent family dish. If required to 
be more highly flavoured, put in a little curry-powder. 



SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AKD GAME. 

18. — WJiite Stock. Take a scrag or knuckle of veal, an 
ox-heel, or calf's-head, together with an old fowl and the 
trimmings of any white poultry or game which can be had, ' 
and lean ham in the proportion of 1 lb. to every 14 lbs. of meat. 
Cut it all into pieces, add 3 or 4 large w:^^roasted onions and I 
heads of celery, with a few blades of mace ; but neither carrots, J 
pepper, nor spice of a]:iy other kind ; put just water enough to 
cover it. Let it boil for 5 hours, it is then fit for use. 

■ If endive be used, it should be boiled in two or three waters to tulic ofl its 
b.'tteracsf-. 



CuAi\ Vll. SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 75 

WHITE SOUP. 

19. — Take a large scrag or a knuckle of veal, and ^ lb. of 
lean ham ; some blades of mace and a piece of ungrated nut- 
meg, sliced onions, and heads of celery, with a little salt and 
an equal quantity of loaf-sugar. Break the bones, and stew 
all gently with 1 gallon to 6 quarts of water — according to 
the weight of the meat — until it is done to rags and the soup 
becomes sufficiently strong ; skim it, and strain it through a 
hair sieve ; or, if allowed to stand during the night, pour it 
into an earthen vessel, and next morning take off the fat. 
When preparing it for table, add to the liquor from i to -^ 
lb. of sweet almonds, blanched and finely pounded ; boil a 
short time and strain again ; then put in -j pint to a pint of 
good thick cream, and the yoll^ of an e^^ ; but when the 
cream and e^^ are put in, be careful not to let the soup boil, 
or it will curdle. The safest Avay to avoid this is to mix the 
cream and eg^ in the tureen and pour the soup upon it. This 
thickening mixture is called, in French cookery, Liaison. 

Or : — Thicken it as follows : — 

Blanch i lb. of sweet almonds, and beat tliem to a paste 
in a marble mortar, with a little water to prevent their 
oiling; mince a large slice of dressed veal or chicken, and 
beat it with a piece of stale white bread : add all this to a pint 
of thick cream, a bit of fresh lemon-peel, and a blade of mace, 
in the finest powder. Boil it a few minutes ; add to it a pint 
of soup, and strain and pulp it through a coarse sieve : put 
this to the rest of the soup, which should boil for ^ an hour 
afterwards. 

If cream cannot be had, use new milk with the yolks of 7 a 
dozen hard-boiled eggs grated and mixed with the almonds as 
a thickening, or beaten up with 2 spoonfuls of ground rice, 
arro\\TOot, or common flour, until it becomes quite smooth 
and of the thickness of cream. 

A?t exceUejit plain white Soup may be made of the broth in 
which a knuckle of veal, or any kind of white poultry or 
rabbits, have been boiled. When the meat has been cut off, 
put the bone back into the broth ; adding 2 or 3 shank-bones 
of mutton nicely cleaned, and \\h. of very fine undressed 
lean pi'ammon of bacon, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a piec€ 
of fresh lemon-peel, 2 or 3 onions, 3 blades of mace, and a 
dessert-spoonful of white pepper : boil all till the meat falls 
quite to pieces. 9 



76 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. VII. 

Another zohite Soup. — Take 2 quarts of the stock, and boil 
the crumb of a roll in a gill of milk ; beat the yolks of 6 hard- 
boiled eg-gs with 3 oz. of sweet almonds very well in a mortar, 
witli a little cayenne pepper, and add the whole to the soup : 
it may be poured over slices of French roll sent up in the 
tureen. 

White Soup may also be varied with rice : wash 2 or 3 oz. 
of the best kind, blanch it in boiling water, and drain it ; add 
the rice to the soup, and let it stew until it swells ; or thicken 
t with ground rice, bruised sago, tapioca, or arrowroot. If 
macaroni is used, it should be added soon enough to get per- 
fectly tender, after soaking in cold water. Vermicelli may 
be added after the thickening, as it requires less time to do. 
If the stock has been made with fowl, take out the white por- 
tion when well stewed, pound the meat in a mortar, and add 
it to the soup ; which is a great improvement. It is the 
fashion now to send up grated Parmesan cheese with white 
soup ; but it partly destroys that delicacy which ought to be 
the distinctive property of all white soups. 

White Potato-Soup. — Take large mealy potatoes, peeled 
raw, and sliced with half the number of onions, seasoned with 
white pepper, mace, and salt, and stewed with 2 lbs. of the 
scrag of mutton or veal in 3 quarts of water during 4 hours ; 
then skimmed and strained. Then add 3 pints of new milk 
and ^ oz. of bitter almonds pounded. Rub the potatoes through 
a tammy. Let it boil before being served up, but keep stirring 
it to prevent the almonds from oiling. 

ALMOND SOUP. 

20. — Make the stock of veal, or an old fowl ; then put into 
a mortar 1 lb. of sweet almonds, with a few of the bitter sort, 
the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs, and a little white pepper : 
pound this very fine, put it into the stock, and let it simmer 
gently, putting in a little cold broth as it boils away. Strain 
it off ; thicken it with butter kneaded in flour ; and, just 
before serving, add a teacupful of good cream. 

RICE SOUP. 

21. — Take white stock, season it, and either whole rice 
Doiled till very tender, or the flour of rice may be used ; 
ll lb. will be sufficient for 2 quarts of broth. 



Chap. YII. SOUPS OF YEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. Tt 

VEAL POTTAGE. 

22. — Take off a knuckle of veal all the meat that can be 
made into cutlets, &c., and set the remainder on to stew 4 or 
5 hours at least, with an onion, a bunch of herbs, a blade of 
mace, some whole pepper, and 5 pints of water: cover it 
close. Strain it, and set it by till next day ; take the fat and 
sediment from the jelly, and simmer it with either turnips, 
celerj^, sea-kale, and Jerusalem artichokes, or some of each, 
cut into small dice, till tender, seasoning it with salt and 
pepper, and butter the size of a walnut. Before serving, rub 
■5- a spoonful of flour with ^ a pint of good cream ; boil it 
a few minutes. Let a small roll simmer in the soup, to be 
served with it. The pottage may be thickened with rice or 
pearl-barley ; or the veal may be minced, and served up in 
the tureen. 

VEAL BROTH.— E. R. 

23. — Stew a knuckle of veal of 4 or 5 lbs. in 3 quarts of 
water, with 2 blades of mace, an onion, a head of celery, and 
a little parsley, pepper, and salt ; let the whole simmer very 
gently until the liquor is reduced to 2 quarts ; then take out 
the meat, when the mucilaginous parts are done, and serve it 
up with parsley and butter. Add to the broth either 2 oz. of 
rice separately boiled, or of vermicelli, put in only long 
enough to be stewed tender. 

FRIAR'S CHICKEN. 

24. — Take 3 quarts of water, and put into it 3 or 4 lbs. of 
knuckle of veal : stew gently till all the goodness is out of the 
meat ; skim the fat off, and strain the broth through a sieve. 
Then take a chicken, or a full-grown young fowl, dissect it 
into pieces, and put it into the broth, which should be made 
hot, and seasoned only with salt and parsley. Let it simmer 
for another hour ; beat the whites and yolks of 3 or 4 eggs 
thoroughly, and mix them well with the soup, just before 
serving ; taking care to stir it all one way. Eabbits may be 
substituted for fowls. 

P TA GE A LA REINE. 

25. — Stew 2 or 3 young fowls for about an hour in good 

fresh-made veal broth ; then take them out, skin them, and 

pound the breast, or only the white meat, in a mortar until it 

becomes quite smooth. That done, mash the yolks of 3 or 4 



78 'modern domestic COOKERt. Csap. Vlt 

liard-boiled eggs with the crumb of a French roll soaked 
either in the broth or in milk, and mix this with the pounded 
meat to form a paste, wliich must be afterwards passed through 
a sieve. During this operation the bones and skin have been 
left stewing in the broth, which must then be strained, and 
the paste put gradually into it : then let it boil briskly for a 
short time, stirring it all the while to ensure its thorough mix- 
ture. When tliat is done take it from the fire ; warm a pint 
or more of cream, and pour it gently into the soup. 

Tliis being a delicate white soup, the broth should only be 
seasoned with salt and mace, nor should there be any other 
vegetable used than celery ; but the cream may be flavoured 
with almonds. 

This is said to be a favourite soup at the table of her 
Majesty. 

GIBLET SO UP.—E. R. 

26. — Scald and clean a set, or more, of giblets ; stew them 
in a little gravy, with 2 onions, a bunch of sweet herbs, 2 
glasses of white wine, pepper, and salt, until the gizzards are 
quite tender ; then take out the giblets and strain the broth. 
Make a stock with 2 lbs. of gravy-beef, 3 onions, and 5 pints 
of water. Skin some onions, slice them thin, and fry them in 
butter, with a smaH quantity of basil, marjoram, and parsley ; 
take them out of the pan ; add flour suflftcient to thicken the 
soup, and let it be slightly browned. Then stir in the boiling 
stock ; let it boil ^ an hour, pass it through a tammy, put 
it again on the fire, and skim it carefully ; add the giblets, 
2 glasses of sherry or Madeira wine, and a little lemon-juice. 
Season it highly. The gizzards should be cut into quarters, 
or they will not become so tender as the other parts ; divide 
the liver, feet, neck, and pinions in moderate-sized pieces ; take 
off the bill and cut the head in two. 

In some marshy situations, where geese are reared more for 
the profit derived from their feathers than their flesh, and thus 
not properly fattened, the whole bird is sometimes made into 
soup, ready trussed for the table, the giblets being dressed 
as above ; the carcase, which is served up separately, being 
smothered in onions. It must be stewed very slowly, and 
will take from 3 to 4 hours, according to its size, before it 
can be brought to table ; but the soup will be of first-rate 
quality. 

Duck Giblets make a very good soup, but, being much 



CiiAP. VII. SOUfS OF TEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 79 

smaller than those of a goose, a larger quantity will be neces- 
sary ; and those of other fowls, tui'keys, and game, may also 
be used with nearly the same effect. 

HUNTER'S SOUP, AND GA3IE STOCK. 

27. — 'NYlien sportsmen bivouac upon the moors, the produce 
of the game-bag must be put into the soup-kettle with any 
odds and ends of other meat, and a bottle or two of any wine 
or beer that can be spared ; then, filling it with water, com,- 
mence the brew, which may be intrusted to any servant, he 
being only required to begin early in the morning, and let 
the game stew long enough to extract from it the entire of 
its juices. 

When the party returns in the evening from shooting they 
will thus find the essential requisite of a good soup. 

GAME STOCK. 
When there is more game in the larder than is required for 
present use, or Avhen it is too old to be sent to table, it should 
be stewed down to a strong consomme; which, when well 
seasoned, will form excellent stock. 

GA3IE SOUP 
28. — May be made of any sort of feathered game — whether 
Ijartridge, grouse, or pheasant, and whether raw and whole, 
or only the remains of the carcase after having been sent to 
table ; the latter is the most usual mode ; for unless the birds 
are very old, few persons have so many as to spare them entire 
for the stock-pot, and the unconsumed parts are most com- 
monly stewed down along with gravy-beef. Take any portion 
of the white meat which has been left, and pound it in a 
mortar ; putting the backs and legs in a stewpan with a quart 
of veal gravy and a slice of lean ham, 2 or 3 green onions, 
and a little pepper and salt, and letting them stew till the 
goodness is completely extracted ; then take out the backs and 
legs, and put in a pint of strong gravy ; take the yolks of 2 
hard-boiled eggs and pound them with the meat that is in the 
mortar ; rub it through the tammy ; add it to the liquor in 
which the legs were stewed : this must be done last, as, if it 
stands long, it will spoil. Mix all together, and stir it over 
the fire until of the desired consistency. If too thick, add 
some pure veal gravy ; but season it very moderately, as it 
ought to possess the high game flavour. 



so MODERIT DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII. 

PARTRIDGE AND PHEASANT SOUP. 

29. — Skill a leash of old birds, and cut them into pieces, 
with 3 or 4 slices of ham, 3 lbs. of gravy beef, a stick of 
celer\', and 3 large onions cut into slices. Fry them all in 
butter till brown, but take care not to burn them. Then 
put them into a stewpan, with 5 pints of boiling water, a few 
peppercorns, and a little salt. Stew it gently 2 hours ; then 
strain it through a sieve, and put it again into a stewpan, with 
some stewed celery and fiied bread ; when it is near boiling, 
skim it, pour it into a tureen, and serve it up hot. 

CLEAR HARE SOUP.~E.R. 

30. — Cut a large hare into pieces, and put it, together with 
a scrag or knuckle of veal, and a cow-heel, into a kettle, with 
5 or 6 quarts of water, herbs, onion, &c., and a little mace ; 
stew it over a slow fire for 2 hours ; then take out the back 
and legs, cut the meat off, returning the bones, and stewing 
the whole until the meat is nearly dissolved. Then strain off 
the gravy, put a glass of wine to every quart of the soup, cut 
the meat into small pieces, and let it boil about 10 minutes 
or i of an hour. Soup may be made in much the same way 
of either leveret ov fawn, only not stewing them so long. 

THICK HARE SOUP. 

31. — Cut the hare into pieces, and lay them at the bottom 
of a large jar, with a slice or tv>^o of lean ham, an onion, a 
stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet herbs, with about 3 
quarts of boiling water. Put the jar into an oven, and let it 
remain until the hare is stewed to rags ; it will take 3 hours 
baking, and the same time simmering by the fire. Strain off 
the liquor, take the meat from the bones and pound it in a 
mortar, mixing it with the soup until it is quite thick. Let 
it boil up once, with a spoonful of Harvey's sauce, a glass of 
port wine, and a little cayenne pepper. Send it to table with 
forcemeat balls in the tureen, made with tlie chopped liver, 
and fried ; or make the forcemeat balls with the brains, and 
grate or pound the liver, when thoroughly boiled, for the pur- 
pose of thickening the soup, which should always be made of 
a good consistence. 

Another. — Put some slices of onion in a stewpan with 2 
oz. of butter, and bayleaves, a few allspice and whole peppers, 
3 cloves, some parsley and thyme; let them stew till the 



Chap. VII. SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 81 

onions are done ; tlirow in as much flour as the butter will 
take up ; cut a hare in pieces, put it in the stewpan, and let if 
brown a little ; add 3 quarts of water or stock. When the 
best pieces (such as the back and legs) are done, take them 
out and cut off the meat, putting back the bones ; let them 
stew for 4 hours ; strain off, and pick all the meat from the 
bones, pound it, and pass it through a fine sieve ; stir in the 
soup to it, let it boil ; season with a glass of port v/ine, a little 
lemon-juice, cayenne, and salt. 

A more frugal Hare Sozq? may, however, be made if there 
be only 3 or 4 in family. It is a very excellent and econo- 
mical plan to cut off the head and shoulders of the hare, and 
roast only the hind quarters. Then, on the following day, 
stew down the bones, along with the head and shoulders, and 
make the whole into soup ; using the brains and liver as above, 
and seasoning it to your palate. A pound or two of shin of 
beef will increase tlie quantity ; and a few minced roots, with a 
mushroom, or a little of the powder, will improve the flavour. 

ARTIFICIAL HARE SOUP. 

32. — Procure a bullock's heart as soon as possible after \\\q 
animal is killed, cut away from it the fat, pipes, and outer 
skin, split and clean it from the blood, then slice it into an 
earthen jar, with a cover that fits close ; add 2 or 3 good-sized 
onions, one of them to be stuck with cloves, a blade of mace, 
pepper, and salt, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a good slice of 
bread ; also a piece of butter rubbed in flour ; put all down 
into a pot v.ith water suflcicient to cover the ingredients, put 
the cover on, and a coarse paste over it, that the steam may 
not escape. Place it in a pan of boiling water, letting the 
water come nearly to the top of the jar, stew it for several 
hours, and keep filling up the pan with boiling water as it 
wastes away. When the meat is tender enough, pound it in 
a marble mortar with the bread till quite fine, moistening it 
occasionally with broth made from fresh beef free from fat ; 
when fine enough pass it through a sieve, add to it the gravy 
that the heart was stewed in, and as much of the beef broth 
as will make the quantity of soup required. Boil it up, and 
add more seasoning of cayenne and salt. If not thick enough, 
add flour and butter, until it becomes of the consistency of 
good cream, A spoonful of sugar and a little port wine will 
improve it.

33. — Take 4 lbs. of freshly killed venison cut off from the 
bones, and 1 lb. of ham in small slices. Add an onion minced, 
and black pepper to your taste. Put only as njuch water as 
will cover it, and stew it gently for an hour, keeping- it closely 
covered. Skim it well, and pour in a quart of boiling water ; 
add a head of celery cut into small pieces, and 3 blades of 
mace. Boil it gently 2h hours ; then put in i lb. of butter, 
divided into small pieces, and rolled in flour, and ^ a pint of 
port or Madeira wine. Let it boil i of an hour longer, and 
send it to table with the meat in it. 

Or* — Take a breast of venison, cut it in small pieces, and 
stew it gently in brown gravy soup. Serve it with roots cut 
in dice and French beans in diamonds, adding 2 glasses of 
port wine when first put on. 

The head of the deer chopped in pieces, and the flesh stewed 
to a jelly, is an excellent addition to the soup. 

TUR TLE SO UP. 

34. — Hang up the turtle by the hind fins, cut off the head, 
and allow it to diciin. 

Cut off the fore fins ; separate the callipash {upper shell) 
from the callipee {under shell), beginning at the hind fins. 
Cut off the fat Avhich will be found adhering to the callipash 
and to the lean meat of the callipee. Then cut off the hind 
fins. Take off the lean meat, from the callipee and from the 
fins, cut it into pieces 2 inches square, and put it into a stew- 
pan. The callipash, callipee, and fins, must be held in scalding 
(not boiling) water for a few minutes, which will cause the 
shell to separate easily. 

Cut the callipash and callipee into pieces about 6 inches 
square, which put into a stock-pot with some light veal stock. 
Let it boil until the meat is tender, and then take it out and 
put it into cold water ; free the meat from the bones, and cut 
it into pieces an inch square. Keturn the bones into the 
stock and let it boil gently for 2 hours, strain it off, and it is 
then fit for use. 

. Cut the fins across into pieces about an inch wide, boil them 
in stock with an onion, 2 or 3 cloves, a faggot of parsley and 
thyme, a. sprig of sweet basil and marjoram. When tender, 
take them out, and add this stock to the other. 

Take the lean meat, put into a stewpan with a pint of 



Chip. VII. SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTKY, AND GAME. 83 

Madeira, 4 tablespoonfuls of chopped green shalot, 2 lemons 
sliced, a bunch of thyme, marjoram, and savory (about 2 
tablespoonfuls of each when chopped), l-J- tablespoonfuls of 
sweet basil (chopped), and 4 tablespoonfuls of parsley. Pound 
together a nutmeg, 12 allspice, 1 blade of mace, o or 6 cloves^ 
1 tablespoonful of pepper and of salt. Mix the whole together 
with as much curry-powder as will lie on a shilling. Put 
about two-thirds of this to the lean meat, with ^ lb. of fresh 
butter and 1 quart of stock. Let the whole be gently stewed 
until the meat is done. 

Take a large knuckle of ham, cut it into very small dice, 
put it into a stewpan with 4 large onions sliced, 6 bay-leaves, 
3 blades of mace, 1 2 allspice, f lb. of butter ; let it simmer 
until the onions are melted. Shred a small bunch of basil, a 
larger one of thyme, savory, and marjoram ; throw these into 
the onions, and keep them as green as possible : when suf- 
ficiently done add flour sufficient to thicken the soup. Add by 
degrees the stock in which the callipash and callipee were 
boiled, and the seasoning stock from the lean meat. Boil for 
an hour ; rub through a tammy, and add salt, cayenne, and 
lemon-juice to palate. Then put in the meat ; let it all boil 
gently about ^ an hour ; and if more wine be required, it 
must be boiled before being added to the soup. This is for a 
turtle of from 40 to 50 lbs. It should, however, be recol- 
lected that the animal is of various weight — from 40 lbs. to 
some cwts. — and the condiments must be apportioned accord- 
ingly. It should invariably be made the day before it is 
wanted. 

3WCK-TURTLE. 

35. — Half a calf's head will be quite sufficient, even if it be 
small, to provide soup enough for a moderate party, as it will 
fill a tureen of 2 quarts ; but it must be fresh and iinstripped 
of the skin, which is the most gelatinous part. 

Take out the brains ; clean the head carefully in hot water, 
by squeezing it with the hand to press out the blood, and leave 
it afterwards for an hour in cold water. Then put it into 5 
or 6 quarts of warm water along with 2 lbs. of veal, 2 lbs. of 
delicate pickled pork, chiefly fat, a roasted onion or two stuck 
full of cloves, and the thinly pared rind of a lemon, together 
with a large bundle of savoury pot-herbs, 2 sliced carrots, and' 
a head of celery. Let this boil for 2 hours : then take up the 
head and the pork. The head must be stripped of , its skin, 



B4 MODER]^ DOMESTIC COOKEPA^ Ckap. YII 

and the brain, tongue, and eye taken out ; let the bones of 
the head be broken and returned to the soup, and boil 2 hours 
longer — the brains being made into forcemeat balls, the tongue 
skinned and sliced ; the black part of the eye should also be 
taken out, and the remainder minced ; the skin being cut into 
pieces of little more than an inch square. While the stock is 
boiling, put into a stewpan a small quantity of butter, with 
some onions sliced thin, a little basil, marjoram, and parsley, 
a small quantity of thyme, 3 bay-leaves, 2 blades of niace, a 
few allspice ; sweat all these well over the fire ; when done, 
add sufficient flour to thicken the soup. Stir in the boiling 
stock by degrees to avoid its being lumpy ; let it boil gently 
for an hour, then rub it through a tammy, set it over the fire ; 
when it boils add the meat. AVhen thoroughly cooked, season 
the soup to your taste with salt, a small quantity of cayenne 
pepper, lemon-juice, together with nearly a pint of either 
Madeira or sherry. Serve with 2 lemons upon a plate, cut 
in half, as some persons like the soup to be somewhat acid. 
Mushrooms are sometimes added. 

The soup Avill take at least 7 or 8 hours in preparation. A 
calf s head requires its own Aveight of meat to make the broth 
of proper equality. 

NEA TS FEE T SOUP. 

36. — Take 2 neat's feet, cut them as you do a calfs head, 
and 1 lb. of the belly part of pickled pork : put 5 pints of any 
sort of broth, the juice and rind of 1 lemon, some parsley and 
lierbs chopped fine, into a stone jar, and send them to the oven ; 
when it comes from the oven, put in a pint of strong gravy 
and a cup of white wine, some hard eggs and forcemeat ballsy 
season with cayenne pepper and salt ; cut the meat into bits. 

Any of these receipts for mock-turtle may be also made 
from pig's face and pettitoes ; and in most country-houses, as 
well as at sea — where pigs are generally kept for fresh meat — 
the head is commonly made into soup in imitation of turtle. 

It has become unfashionable among first-rate cooks to put 
those egg-halls^ formerly so common, into mock-turtle ; but as 
they are still used by the cooks of the old school, we here add 
the mode of preparing them : — • 

Take out the yolks of some hard-boiled eggs, and beat them 
m a mortar with a very little salt and cayenne, and make them 
mto a paste with the white of a raw eg^. Eoll the paste into 



CtiAP.VIL SOUPS OF VEAL, POULTRY, AND GAME. 85 

balls not larger than marbles, put them into the soup, and boil 
fur 10 minutes. 

3IULLA GA TA WNEE. 

o7. — Slice some onions and a few shalots, put them in a 
mortar with -j lb. of fresh butter, pound them well, add 3 or 4 
dessert-spoonfuls of curry powder, a little cayenne pepper and 
salt ; cut up some India pickle, which pound well with the 
other ingredients, add flour sufficient to thicken the soup, and 
a little cold stock to work the whole into a stiff paste. When 
thoroughly amalgamated put it into a stewpan, stir in boiling 
stock sufficient for tlie quantity of soup required ; let it boil 
for ^ an hour ; rub it through a tammy ; add joints of chicken 
or rabbit, with lemon-juice and salt to palate. Serve with rice. 

MUTTON 3IULLA GA TA WNEE. 

38. — Take 4 lbs. of the scrag end of a neck of mutton ; cut 
off the lean meat in small pieces, boil the remainder and the 
bones well in 3 quarts of water, with a bunch of sweet herbs, 
parsley, mace, and 2 onions ; strain it and carefully take off the 
fat ; put the pieces of lean mutton into a stewpan with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of curry-powder, pepper, salt, and a little butter ; 
let it simmer gently till the gravy is drawn, then add to it 
the soup from the bones ; boil them together till the meat ib 
tender, thicken the soup with a little ground rice till a little 
tliicker than cream ; if not seasoned enough, add a little more 
curry-powder to the thickening ; boil it ^ an hour more, and 
it is ready to serve. Send with it a dish of boiled rice. 

Green peas are also occasionally used for the same purpose, 
as a substitute for the dhal, with which, in India, this soup is 
frequently thickened. 

WINE AND SEER SOUPS. 

Throughout Germany these soups are very common, as 
they can be made at a moment in the following manner : — 

39. — Take a pint of white wine (or beer), and i^ pint of 
water, s\^'eeten it to the taste with white sugar, fry one large 
table-spd6hful of flour with a piece of butter until it is very 
brown, then pour the M'ine and water upon it, and boil it a 
few minutes with lemon-peel and cinnamon. Then take the 
yolks of 6 eggs, beat them well, and add the boiling soup very 
slowly, stirring it w^ell all the time that it may not curdle ; 



86 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEHY. CnAP. VII. 

put a little toasted bread, cut very fine, into the soup, and 
serve it up hot. 

BOUILLON 

40. — Is the commo7i soup of France, and is in use in almost 
every French family. Put beef into an earthen stock-pot in 
the proportion of 1 lb. to 1 quart of cold %yater. Place it 
at the side of the fire, and let it become slowly hot. By so 
doing the fibre of the meat is enlarged, the gelatine is dis- 
solved, and the savorous parts of the meat are diffused through 
the broth. When the object is simply to make a good, pure-* 
flavoured beef broth, part of the shin or leg will answer the 
purpose, adding some vegetables, and letting it stew 4 or 5 
hours ; but if the meat is to be eaten, the rump or leg-of- 
mutton piece should be used. 



VEGETABLE SOUPS. 

Although many of the following soups are made purely of 
vegetables, yet some — and those generally the best — are made 
on a foundation of some sort of meat-broth in which the roots 
are stewed. The broth is therefore the real stock on which 
these soups are made, though each bears the name of the 
vegetable which gives it flavour ; but when made solely from 
herbs, roots, and vegetables, and used as a basis for the forma- 
tion of soupes-maigres, the stock is then composed of every 
sort in season which can, by long stewing, be reduced to a 
pulp, in which every species of savoury herb — such as chervil, 
tarragon, and marjoram — are mixed, together with a few chilis, 
shalots, and a head of garlic, seasoned with mace, whole 
peppers, salt, and mushroom ketchup ; to which may be added 
a little curry-powder. The pulp is then strained ; and, beiiig 
thus rather highly seasoned, may be kept for a few days, and 
used in aid of any other soup. It must be left to simmer during 
several hours ; and should it need browning, some sliced onions, 
fried in butter, will be all that is necessary. 

It sliould be observed that all soups, wJiether of fish or vege- 
tables, which are made without any intermixture of meat-broth, 
are strictly inaigre, and will be treated of under that head. 



Chap. VII. VEGETABLE SOUPS. 87 

DRIED OR SPLIT PEA SOUP.—E.R. 

41. — The liquor in which a leg of mutton or :^ a calfs 
head has been boiled will make an excellent stock for this 
soup ; but if that of pork be used, and it be much salted, part 
of the liquor should be throv/n away and the remainder mixed 
with fresh water. Put on the stock to boil, slice into it a head 
of celery, a carrot and turnip, with 2 onions ; boil a sufficient 
quantity of peas in fresh water, putting- them in dry and 
when the water boils quickly ; when they will mash throw 
them into the broth with a crust of bread the size of a roll ; 
let them boil for t an hour, then rub the whole through a 
sieve, season to taste. Some dried mint should be signt to 
table in a castor. 

Or : — Make a puree of peas boiled in a little broth, adding 
a large onion ; pass it through a sieve ; reduce it to a proper 
thickness with boiled milk, add a dessertspoonful of moist 
sugar, with pepper and salt to taste. It should be passed 
through the sieve 2 or 3 times to make it quite smooth. On 
shipboard, and in many country-houses, it is not unusual to 
cut some of the boiled pork into very small bits, and serve 
them up either separately or mixed in the soup. Fried onions 
will add much to its flavour if added to the broth of which the 
soup is made. 

GREEN-PEA SOUP.—E.R. 

42. — Boil in salt water, over a slow fire, a quart of freshly- 
gathered large green peas, with a handful of parsley, sorrel, 
and a few chives, until they become thoroughly stewed ; drain 
and pound them in the mortar vmtil made into a puire, which 
mix gradually into veal or beef broth : if that of beef, seasoned 
only with pepper and salt ; but if of veal, with mace and a 
very little refined sugar. Have ready some leeks and lettuce 
tliat have been boiled, but not to a pulp, and fry them in 
butter along with some slices of bread cut into dice; put them 
into the soup just before sending it up ; add a few heads of 
boiled asparagus when in season ; or if not, hop-tops are a 
tolerable substitute. Chopped mint is also served with it. 
The bread is frequently sent to table separately. 

The sorrel will give a very delicate flavour of acidity to the 
soup ; but care should be taken never to acquire this flavour 
by adding vinegar to any kind of pea, lentil, or farinaceous 
pulse soup, as it will occasion it to curdle. 



88 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Chap. VII. 

Another. — Take 3 cabbage lettuces, 3 onions, a pint of 
young peas, ^ lb. of butter, a faggot of mint, pepper and salt 
to taste ; cut these into small pieces, and stew them till tender 
Take 3 pints of old peas to 5 pints of water, boil them till 
quite soft ; rub them through a sieve ; add this to the above 
ingredients ; let it boil up, and then serve. 

Or : — Take a peck of green peas, and, in shelling them, 
separate the old from the young ; boil the former portion until 
they are quite tender, and, if not sufficiently sweet, add a small 
quantity of powdered lump-sugar ; then rub them through a 
sieve, return them to tlie stock, and let them stew gently toge- 
ther. In making these soups great care should be taken 
to render them perfectly smooth ; for should there be the 
least grittiness, it will entirely destroy their goodness. Put 
in the young peas just time enough before the soup is served 
to allow them to be properly cooked ; artichoke bottoms or 
cucumbers may be added : pare a couple of cucumbers, cut 
them in pieces, take out the seeds, dry them in a cloth, flour, 
and fry them of a light brown, and serve them up with the 
soup as it goes to table. The soup may be made of any sort 
of broth. A small quantity of carbonate of soda, or a little 
spinach boiled soft and pulped with the peas, will keep the 
soup green ; but the soda should be sparingly used. 

LEiVTIL-SOUF. 

43.— The lentils are made into a puree, and seasoned in 
the same manner as in Avhite or dried pea-soup, but should 
always be made of veal-broth, and the pulse boiled long 
enough to extract the scarlet colour, which gives it a gooa 
appearance ; for its flavour is much the same as that of soup 
made of peas. 

SOUPE A LA JULIENNE. 

44. — Cut in pieces, either in thin strips or of the size of 
dice, 1 head of celery, carrots, turnips, leeks, and the hearts 
of lettuce, 2 each, Avith 12 small button onions pared very 
carefully to preserve tlieir shape ; put 2 oz. of butter into a 
stewpan, put the vegetables on the butter, together with any 
others that may be in season ; more particularly heads of 
as])aragus, and a little sorrel to impart a slight flavour of 
acidity, with a lump of sugar to prevent any bitterness oi 
taste. Stew or fry them over a slow fire, keeping then 
stirred, and adding a little p;Tavy occasionally ; soak pieces ox 



Chap. VII. YEaETABLE SOUPS. 89 

crust of bread about the size of shillings in the remainder of 
the broth or stock, and, v/hen the vegetables are nearly stewed, 
add them, and warm the whole up together in the necessary 
quantity of beef or veal broth ; beef being the most savoury, 
but veal being, in summer, thought the lightest and generally 
preferred : neither pepper nor ketchup should be used. 

Although this may be made at any time of the year, yet, 
being chietiy composed of vegetables, it is more distinctively 
a spring soup ; but if made in winter, the vegetables should 
be only stewed ; for, if fried, the flavour of the soup would be 
unpleasantly strong. It is an universal Parisian dish, and has 
lately come into very general use, as a species of soup sa7ite, 
at English tables. 

SOUFE A LA FLAMANDE. 

45. — Take carrots, turnips, and onions of a large size, 2 of 
each ; a small quantity of lettuce, leeks, chervil, and endive. 
Shred them in pieces, and put them in a stewpan with a 
small piece of butter and a teacupful of gravy ; set them over 
a slow fire, and let them be frequently shaken in the pan until 
they become tender ; then add a quart of any sort of broth, 
and let it all stew gently for an hour, seasoning it with salt, 
a small quantity of mace, a little sugar, and a little cayenne. 
Mix thoroughly the yolks of 3 eggs with ^ pint of cream, and 
add them to the soup the last thing before you serve it up. 
Keep stirring it after the eggs are in, until it almost boils, but 
not quite. 

Or .-—Wash, peel, and slice 12 potatoes and 6 onions, cut 
6 or 8 heads of celery into small pieces ; put these into a stew- 
pan with i lb. of butter and about a pint of water ; let them 
simmer 1 hour ; fill up the pan with a good stock ; let it boi] 
till the potatoes are dissolved ; rub it through a sieve ; add a 
pint of cream. 

SOUFE A LA CRECI.—E.R. 

46. — Grate 12 carrots, the red part only, slice 4 onions, a 
turnip, and a piece of lean ham, 2 lettuces, a leek, a stick oi 
celery, with a blade of mace, a few allspice, and a few sprigs 
of parsley and thyme ; put them all into a stewpan, with a 
piece of butter. Let it simmer for ^ an hour, stirring occa- 
sionally ; then fill it up with stock, allowing it to boil gently 
2 hours ; then put in the crumb of 2 French rolls ; when well 
eoaked, rub the whole through a tamis. Let it boil up ; skim 



OO 1\r0DEM DOMES'riC COOKERY. Chap. Vll j 

it well ; add salt if required, and a small lumi) of sugar, i 
Have a little rice ready boiled, and serve it up in the tureen, j 

CARROT SOUP. 

47. — Take 6 or 8 full-grown carrots, scrape them clean, | 
and rasp only the outer riiid^ or soft red part, and if you have ' 
a ripe tomata, add it, sliced, to the raspings, but use no other i 
vegetable except onions. While this is being done, the broth ! 
of any kind of fresh meat \\'hich has been got ready should be j 
heated and seasoned with a couple of onions fried in butter, j 
but without pepper, or any other kind of seasoning, except a I 
snial I quantity of mace and a little salt ; put the raspings into ; 
2 quarts of the skimmed broth, cover the stewpan close, and 
let it simmer by the side of the fire for 2 or 3 hours, by which ■ 
time the raspings will have become soft enough to be pulped ; 
through a fine sieve : after v/hich the soup should be boiled 
until it is as smooth as jelly, for any curdly appearance will j 
spoil it. J 

Most of such vegetables as can be easily made into purees, ; 
and combined with any sort of broth, will, in this manner, i 
make excellent soup of different denominations, though all , 
founded upon the same meat-stock. Beef is always preferred ; 
for savoury soups, ai:id veal or fowls for the more delicate '■ 
white soups : to which from \ a pint to a pint of cream, or, if ; 
that cannot be had, the same quantity of milk and the yolks ■ 
of a couple of raw eggs, should be added for every 2 quarts of i 
soup : the latter will not impart the richness of cream. \ 

Parsnip Soup is made in the same way as that of carrots ; 
only that the whole of the root is used, and it requires either ; 
another tomato or a spoonful of chili vinegar to check its ^ 
rather mawkish sweetness. ■ 

Vegetable Marrow. — Sometimes thickened with arrov/root 
and cream, flavoured with almond-powder ; and occasionally j 
coloured with a small quantity of saffron, which, to some \ 
palates, adds an agreeable fi-avour. The soup must not be \ 
allowed to boil after the cream is put into it, or it would be \ 
likely to make it curdle. ^ 

PALESTINE SOUP. | 

48. — Take 2 or 3 dozen of Jerusalem artichokes according | 
to their size, pare and slice them into a pan of water ; then . 
drain, and put them into a 3-quart stewpan with a little butter, 



Chap. VIT. VEGEl'ABLTl SOUPS. 91 

a good piece of ham, a blade of mace, 3 onions sliced thin, and 
the white part of 2 heads of celery. Let them stew for an 
hour ; then fill up the stewpan with white veal broth, and add 
the crumb of 2 French rolls. Let it stew till soft enough to 
be passed through the tamis. Return it into the stewpan, boil 
it up, skim well, add salt and sugar, and put -j pint of hot 
cream in the tureen when sent to table : add croutons of fried 
bread. 

Turnip Soup. — Proceed as for Palestine soup ; either veal 
or mutton broth may be employed. 

LEEK OR ONION SOUP. 

49. — The liquor in which a leg of mutton has been boiled will 
do very well for this broth. IMix a spoonful or two of oatmeal, 
according to the quantity of broth, in cold water, very smooth . 
the same as if for gruel, add a little of the broth, by degrees 
until the whole is incorporated ; then boil the liquor with anv 
quantity of leeks or onions — both or either — until it becomes 
of the consistency of cream. Or, omit the oatmeal, and sub- 
stitute flour, stirring the soup very hard for 5 minutes ; and 
when you are about taking it from the fire, stir in the yolks of 
2 raw eggs beat up with a little more broth, and serve it 
immediately. 

Onions, peeled, pared, and cut into pieces, then shred into 
a pan and fried in either oil or butter, without any broth, but 
simply having boiling water poured over them, and some 
toasted bread, seasoned merely with pepper and salt, are con- 
sidered very refreshing when thus made into a soup, and much 
used by ladies throughout the Continent after the fatigues of a 
ball. 

TOM ATA SOUP. 

50. — Cut up 2 onions and fry them in butter ; when the 
onions are brown, add to them a dozen tomatas, from which 
you have squeezed the water, and then proceed as for Creci 
soup. A moderate quantity of tomata pulped or shredded, 
mixed up with any of the vegetable soups, will be generally 
found an improvement, as it imparts a delicacy of colour and 
a pleasing acidity of flavour. 

CELERY SOUP. 

51. — Blanch the heads in warm water, and put them into a 
stewpan with veal broth and a lump of sugar ; boil them for 



92 I\IODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. YH. ; 

an hour or two until soft enough to be either pulped through j 
a sieve and thickened with cream, or eaten in the manner of a I 
stew. A little cayenne may be added, but without any addi- j 
tion of either potherbs or pungent sauces. ' 

AR TI CHOKE SOUP. \ 

52. — Clean the bottoms from the leaves and chokes, and ' 
put them to soak for ^ an hour in a small quantity of milk ; then j 
stew them gently with a piece of butter kneaded in flour. When \ 
sufficiently tender, take them out and mash them ; rub them \ 
through a hair sieve, and let them simmer over a gentle fire ; ] 
add a bunch of young onions, some thyme, and a little parsley. \ 
When nearly done, poun^ in a mortar 2 oz. of blanched sweet : 
almonds, the hard-boiled yolks of 4 eggs, and a spoonful of i 
white sugar ; put them to 2 quarts of veal broth, and season ] 
it with salt and cayenne pepper : set it on the fire for a few \ 
minutes before serving. ] 

Or : — Into a rich stock, made of knuckle of veal, beef- '. 
bones, &c., with a little carrot and celery, pepper or chilis, { 
cut several artichokes, and put them in a saucepan with a little '. 
of the stock ; letting them boil very gently until quite tender, j 
Then put them through a sieve, mix them by degrees in as j 
much cream as will thicken the soup, add the stock, and warm ■ 

all together without boiling it. < 

i 

ASPARAGUS SOUP, I 

53. — Take 2 quarts of good beef or veal broth : put to it 1 
4 onions, 2 or 3 turnips, and some sweet herbs, with the white S 
parts of a hundred of young asparagus ; but, if old, or very '; 
large in the stem, half that quantity will do, and let them | 
simmer till sufficiently tender to be rubbed through a tammy, ] 
whicli is not an easy matter if they be not very young. Then ^ 
strain and season it ; have ready the boiled tops of the aspara- 'i 
gus, and add them to the soup. j 

Or : — Poach 6 eggs rather hard, have ready 100 of asparagus ', 
heads boiled tender ; boil 3 quarts of clear gravy soup ; put J 
into it for a minute or two a fowl just roasted ; then add a few | 
tarragon leaves ; season M'ith a little salt ; put the eggs and | 
^asparagus heads quite hot into the tureen, and pour the soup 
over them without breaking them. The fowl will be just aa 
good as before for made dislies. 



Chap. VII. VEGETABLE SOUPS. 93 

SPUING SOUP. 

54. — Take any or all sorts of gi-een vegetables, sea-kale, 
asparagus tops, green peas, spinach, lettuce, and sorrel, with 
mustard and cress, chives, and young onions, to which gher- 
kins, cucumbers, and green capsicums may be added as the 
season advances. Stew them in any kind of good broth, either 
until they can be made into a puree, which is by far the best 
way, or they may be chopped small and left in the soup, but 
2aot boiled quite so much as when meant to be pulped. 

THICK SPRING SOUP. 
55. — Have ready washed and picked a bunch of spring 
onions, some carrots, lettuces, cliervil, spinach, parsley, thyme, 
sorrel, mint, and asparagus ; put them in a stewpan, with a 
slice of butter ; let it sweat for ^ an hour on a brisk fire, stir 
ring it occasionally ; have ready some French rolls that have 
been previously soaked in water and squeezed dry, sufficient 
to thicken the soup ; add a few mushroom trimmings, fill it 
up with good broth made of any kind of meat ; let it nearly 
boil, skim, and pass it through a tammy ; season with a little 
salt and sugar ; garnish with asparagus points or croutons : it 
should be very green. If it be ajozir maigre, tlie broth must 
be omitted, and butter with flour and curry-powder added. 

SUM3IER SOUP. 

56. — Take 2 cucumbers, 12 or 14 onions, 3 potatoes, 1 let- 
tuce, 1 head of white cabbage ; fry these together in butter, 
stew them 3 or 4 hours in 3 pints of stock ; add a little green 
mint, parsley, and a pint of green peas ; let it stew for 2 hours 
more ; press it through a sieve, and thicken it with flour and 
butter. 

WINTER SOUP. 

57. — Take carrots, turnips, and the heart of a head of 
celery, cut into dice, with a dozen button onions ; half boil 
them in salt and water, with a little sugar in it ; then throw 
tliem into the broth ; and, when tender, serve up the soup : 
or use rice, dried peas and lentils, and pulp them into the 
soup to thicken it. 

With many of these soups, small suet dumplings, very 
lightly made, and not larger than an e^^, are boiled either 
in broth or water, and put into the tureen just before serving, 
and are by most persons thought jin improvement, but are 



94 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII, 

more usually put into plain gravy-soup than any other, and 
should be made light enough to swim in it. 



FISH SOUPS. 

Notwithstanding the quantity of excellent fish with which 
English markets are supplied, this nutritious and economical 
viand is not often introduced at table in the form of soup, 
Nothing could be more easy than to multiply receipts for an 
almost endless variety : those that follow will, however, show 
how much may be done with many kinds of fish which are not 
in verv hig^h estimation. 

Though called " fish-soup," the foundation, or stock, is 
always better if made of meat, and veal is generally preferred. 
We therefore add a receipt for its composition, as it may be 
applied to any kind of fish. 

STOCK FOR FISH SOUP. 

58. — Take 12 flounders, or any small flat fish, and the same 
number of perch ; gut and clean them carefully ; put them 
into a stewpan with 2 quarts of strong veal-broth ; add a few 
slices of lean ham, 2 or 3 carrots, celery, and onions cut in 
slices, some sweet herbs, and salt, with a little cayenne ; stov/ 
till the fish will pass through a coarse sieve ; then return it 
into the stewpan, with a good lump of butter and some flour 
to thicken it ; add a couple of large glasses of white Avine, 
and a large spoonful of garlic vinegar. The gravy from potted 
herrings, anchovies, or a little Oude sauce, will also improve 
tlie flavour. 

This stock, if once reboiled, will, in cold weather, keep well 
for a month ; or, if served as soup, the quantity may of course 
be reduced according to the number of the party intended to 
part-ake of it, and it will be found excellent. Indeed, any 
species of fish may be made into soup in the same manner. 
If meant to be hroiciied, the onions shr^uld be fried, and a 
good spoonful of mushroom ketchup or India soy be added ; 
and red wine will be better than either sherry or IMadeira. 
Ijut if left wliite, creain should be substituted for ketchup 
and soy ; a glassful of gii^.ger-wine will answer the purpose 
of red wine. 

Siock for Fish Soupe-Maicjre. — Take 1 lb, of skate, 4 or o 



Chap. VII. PISH SOUPS. 95 

flounders, and 2 lbs. of eels. Clean them avcH, and cut them 
into pieces ; cover them with ^Yater, and season them witii 
mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of 
celery, 2 parsley-roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet herbs. 
Simmer 1^ hour, closely covered, and then strain it off for 
use. If for brovrn soup, first fry the fish brown in butter, and 
then do as above. It will not keep more than 2 or 3 days. 

In making this stock it should also be observed, that the 
bones of the fish are v.hat constitute its best part ; for if stewed 
down in a digester they will become a jelly of a very rich 
nature, which may be applied to many sorts of soups and 
.sauces. The bones of large fish — salmon, cod, soles, and 
turbot — are never taken from the dish on which they are 
served ; and therefore should always be returned to the stock- 
pot ; or any remains and trimmings of the fish may be used. 
Add to this a carrot and an onion or two, and let the whole 
stew until dissolved. 

To thicken or enrich white or fish soups, it is a good way 
to pour them, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 2 or 3 fresh 
eggs. 

FISH S0UPE-3IAIGRE. 

59. — For a party of a dozen, clean and nicely wash 1 lb. 
each of dace, roach, or any common fish ; stew them with as 
many large carrots, half the number of lettuces, a handful of 
leeks, 4 onions, and a handful of sorrel, in as much water as 
will cover them, until the whole are done to a mash ; strain 
it through a coarse cloth, and boil the liquor, closely covered, 
1 hour. Have ready some of the above-mentioned vegetables, 
cut small ; flour, and boil them in butter, and simmer them 
in the soup + an hour, with pepper, salt, and a few cloves. 
Soften a rasped French roll in broth, and, having mixed the 
yolks of 6 fresh eggs with a few crumbs, stir them into the 
soup, and pour the whole over the roll. 

Or : — Have ready the pulp of old or fresh peas ; and add 
them, and as much of the water that boiled them, witli 4 oz. 
of butter, pepper, and salt, as will make the soup of a proj^er 
consistence. Stir often, and boil till ready to serve. 

RAY OR SKATE SOUP. 

60. — This fish contains a number of small bones, surround- 
in^' rhe pectoral fins, which are so delicate as to be easih 



96 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VII. 

converted into a jelly, and therefore well adapted for tlie 
making of soup. 

Make it of the stock directed for fish soup, with 1 oz. of 
vermicelli boiled in it a little before it is served. Then add 
i pint of cream, beaten with the yolks of 2 eggs. Stir it near, 
but not on, the fire. Serve it with a small French roll made 
hot in a Dutch oven, and then soaked in the soup an hour. 

CODLING SOUF. 

61. — Take the meat from a codling, pound it in a mortar 
with ■5- pint of shrimps shelled ; shred some parsley, and 
pound the whole with the crumb of a roll previously soaked 
m milk ; make the mxixture up into balls vrith an egg ; season 
with mace and pepper ; and stew down 2 or 3 codlings or 
haddocks into good broth ; strain it, take out the meat, pulp 
it through a sieve, boil it with parsley-roots, thicken the soup, 
and send it up with the forcemeat-balls. 

HADDOCK SOUF. 

62. — Take 2 haddocks, fillet them, put the bones with 
6 lbs. of leg of beef and some other fish-bones, make a good 
stock ; when it has boiled up, add 2 onions, carrot, and tur- 
nip, and a few allspice. Make a thickening with i lb. of 
butter, i lb. of lean ham ; slice some basil, marjoram, parsley, 
and thyme ; sweat them until done ; then add flour sufficient 
for the quantity of soup to be made. When that is cooked, 
strain off the stock and stir into the flour, mix it smoothly, and 
let it boil for an hour. Eub it through a tammy, add a glass 
of Madeira, pepper, salt, and cayenne. Cut the fillets of 
haddock in pieces an inch square, remove the skin, fry them 
with a little butter, pepper, and salt ; drain them from the fat, 
and put them in the tureen, pouring the soup over them. 

Two dozen large oysters, bearded, and the liquor thrown in, 
IS an improvement. 

A Cod's -head also forms an admirable soup; but in 
London and other great towns they are too expensive to be 
thus used. Hcdibut is, however, cheap, and good soup may 
be made from it ; as also from hake and ling, which both bear 
an inferior price in our markets. 

LOBSTER SOUP.—E.R. 

63. — If prepared fish-stock be not used, the stock of this 
eoup may be made of small codlings, eels, plaice, floimders, or 



Chap. VIT. FISH SOUPS. 91 

any fish not of sufficient consequence to be dressed in any 
other way. Clean and cut them in pieces, take the meat out 
of 1 or 2 lobsters, cut it into small but handsome pieces, and 
lay it aside ; break the shell and add it to the fish for the stock, 
which should be boiled gently for several hours ; take the 
coral of the lobster, pound it in a mortar, with a small piece 
of the stock, partly pounded, and make it up into forcemeat- 
balls, with a little chopped parsley, bread-crumbs, and an egg-. 
When the stock is sufficiently done, strain it, thicken it with 
butter and flour, or cream ; warm the lobster in it, and send it 
up, cut small, with tlie forcemeat-balls. Season it also deli- 
cately, but yet sufficiently to give it flavour, which can be 
imparted by any of the compound sauces so commonly adver- 
tised. If made of Jarge lobsters, and sufficient for a party, it 
is, however, rather expensive, and can be made of the follovr- 
iiig, which is equally good for the purpose, and much cheaper, 
as being without the large claws of the lobster. 

CRAYFISH SOUP. 

64. — Take 50 crayfish; pull out the gut -which is attached 
to the centre fin of the tail, as it gives great bitterness to tlie 
soup ; boil them in salt and water until they are red ; pick the 
meat from the tails ; pound the bodies v.ith J lb. of butter : 
put this into a stewpan with 2 French rolls and some fish or 
meat stock for 1 hour, but do not let it boil ; rub through a 
tammy ; add the tails, and then* serve. 

This fish, it should be observed, is the small fresh-water 
crayfish ; but good soup can be made of large or small crabs, 
p}'atv?is, and shrimps ; the latter of which have much the best 
flavour. They may, all or either, be made into soup alone ; 
or if mixed whole, or pounded into the pui-ee of any other fish- 
soup, they ^si\\ prove an excellent addition. Their shells and 
small claws may, indeed, be made into a paste by pounding 
them in a mortar with a lump of fresh butter, and putting the 
paste to stew until quite hot, when it must be strained and 
put nito cold water, after which it may be potted and used for 
t^arious purposes. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

65. — Take 50 oysters, blanch them, but do not let them 
boil ; strain them through a sieve, and save the liquor. Put 
\ lb. of butter into a stewpan ; when it is melted, add 5 oz. 
of ^our ; stir it over the fir^ for a few minutes : add the liquor 

i' 



93 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Vii. 

from the oysters, 2 quarts of veal stock, 1 qaart of new mi Ik ; 
season with salt, peppercorns, a little cayenne pepper, a blade of 
mace, Harvey sauce and essence of anchovies, a tablespoonful 
each ; strain it through a tammy ; let it boil 10 minutes ; put 
the oysters into the tureen with a gill of cream, and pour the 
boiling soup upon them. 

Or : — Take 2 quarts of fish-stock. Have ready a quart of 
oysters ; remove the beards and tough parts of the centre, and 
stew them ; beat the oysters in a mortar with the yolks of 6 
hard-boiled eggs ; put this into the stock, let it simmer for an 
hour, adding a large spoonful of essence of anchovy ; a little 
before serving put in i pint of cream ; after which th^' soup 
must not be suffered to boil. 

A more co?nmo7i plan is to take 2 large onions, and stick 
them with cloves, a very small bunch of sweet herbs, some 
v/hole black pepper, a blade of mace, and a hard crust of bread 
toasted a pale brown. Put all these into 3 quarts of water, 
and let it boil uniil reduced to 2 ; then strain it off. Wlieii 
tender, put all into your soup. Then take 50 oysters, bearded, 
and let them be fried a pale brown ; put them and their liquor 
into the soup with 2 or 3 anchovies, and let them all boil 
together i of an hour. It will keep some days, and is better 
the second day than the first. 

Good soupe-maigre may also be made from clams, whilksj 
cockles, and even from that contemptible little shell-fish the 
periwinkle ; but if muscles be used, care should be taken to 
beard them, and take out the small crabs of which they form 
part, as they are thought to be poisonous. 

EEL SOUP. 
QC). — Take 3 lbs. of small eels, and skin them; bone 1 or 
2 ; cut them in very small pieces ; fry them very lightly in a 
stewpan with a bit of butter and a sprig of par*ley. Put to 
the remainder 3 quarts of water, a crust of breaa, 3 blades of 
mace, some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs ; cover them close, and stew till the fish breaks from 
the bones; then strain it off; pound it to a paste, and pass it 
through a sie^^e. Toast some bread, cut it into dice, and pom 
the soup on it, boiling. Add the scollops of eel, and serve. 
The soup will be as rich as if made of meat, i pint of 
cream, or milk, with a teaspoonful of flour rubbed smooth in 
it, is a great improvement. 



:hap. yii. fish sours. so 



To every pound of eels add a quart of water, and let the 
whole boil till one-half of the liquor is wasted. The soujd of 
conger eels is also said to be good, but the fish has not the 
richness of the fresh- water eel, and can only be recommended 
by its cheapness. 

LAKE AND POND FISH SOUP. 
67. — Take a pound each of pike, perch, roach, dace, gudgeon, 
carp and tench, eels, or any fresh-water fish that can be ob- 
tainecl ; wash them in salt and water, and stew them with a 
tomata, carrots, leeks, fried onions, and sweet herbs, in as 
much water as will cover them ; and let them stew until the 
whole is reduced to a pulp ; then strain tlie liquor, and boil it 
for another hour until it becomes quite smooth. Then have 
ready some roots of any sort that maybe in season, wliich have 
been chopped small, and boiled either in milk or water : add 
them to the soup, and let it simmer for i of an hour ; season 
it, if milk has been used, with mace and celery, with a little 
cayenne ; but if made solely with water, then use chili vine^-ar, 
soy, mushroom ketchup, or any of the savoury sauces. 

FISH SOUP AND STEW.—E.R. 
68. — Make the stock of any sort of fish, then take cutlets 
of sole, brill, gurnet, or any other fish, and stew them in the 
following manner :— Chop all kinds of sweet herbs, a small 
bit of garlic, or rub the board on which the herbs are chopped 
with garlic ; an onion or two, 3 carrots, and 2 or 3 turnips ; 
stew these for a few mmutes in butter, then add one part of 
wine to two of water, according to the quantity of fish, and 
the juice of ^ a lemon. Stew the marinade together for I of 
an hour, strain it, and, when cold, put in the fish cutlets, and 
simmer them very gently until the liquor is reduced ; then add 
it to the first stock, thicken the soup with i pint of cream, and 
send up the cutlets in a separate dish, covered either with a 
batter made of flour, eggs, and milk ; or with a sauce made 
with a few spoonfuls of flour, with a little salt, olive-oil, and 
wine of any sort, heated in a pan, and seasoned. This will 
answer in a small party for both fish and soup. 

TURTLE SOUPE MAIGRE. 
^9. — Having thus enumerated most of the cheap fish which 
may be made into soup, with the addition of vegetable and fish 
stock, we here add tlie present receipt, as being likely to form 

v2 



100 :-,IODEPvX DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. TIL ; 

a superior kind of soupe-maigre ; for although always looked | 
upon as a meat-soup, in consequence of its being inade upon a 
foundation of veal-broth (which must be admitted to be in all 

cases the best stock as a basis for fish-soup), yet the turtle, ; 

though amphibious, and laying its numerous eggs upon the i 

land, where they are buried in the sand, and engendered by ; 

the heat of the sun, has ever been ranked among the race of i 
fish, as living chiefly in the sea ; and as arrangements have, it 
seems, been made for killing the animals in the West Indies, 
and bringing over, in jars, the flesh, which comes here in a 
state of jelly, this only needs to be stewed up in a broth of 

vegetable or fish stock, instead of meat, and in such quantity ] 

as to make the jelly sufficiently limpid for soup : seasoning it \ 

in the same manner as the other receipt ; but adding a rather j 

larger proportion of curry-powder and a few truffles to correcJi . 

the vapidity of the fisli and vegetable broth ; but the process ' 

of preparing the turtle must be altered, as it is at present pre- i 

pared ^^itli an acid which no boiling will remove. i 



SOUPES MAIGEE. \ 

70. — Pare and slice 5 or 6 cucumbers; and add to these i 

the inside of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or ; 

3 onious, some pepper and salt, H pint of young peas, and I 
a little parsley. Put these, v.-ith '^ lb. of fresh butter, into I 
a saucepan, to stew in their ovrn liquor, near a gentle fire, + an i 
hour ; then pour 2 quarts of boiling water to the vegetables, \ 
and stew them 2 hours ; rub down a little flour into a teacupful 
of water, boil it with the rest 15 or 20 minutes, and serve it. j 

Or : — Peel and slice 6 large onions, 6 potatoes, 6 carrots, 
and 4 turnips ; fry them in i lb. of butter, and pour on them 'l 

4 quarts of boiling water. Toast a crust of bread as brown 
and hard as possible, but do not burn it ; put it with some i 
celery, sweet herbs, white pepper, and salt to the above ; stew ] 
it all gently 4 hours, then strain it through a tammy : slice ; 
carrot, celery, and a little turnip, and stew them tender in jj 
the soup. If approved, add an anchovy and a spoonful of 
ketchup, with toasted bread, or the crumb of a French roll, 
cut in slices. 

Or : — One gallon of water, a very large plateful of carrots, 
turnips, and onions, with celeiy cut small, and fried in either 



Chap. YIL SOUPES MAIGEE. 101 

butter or dripping (though, if not a fast day, dripping is best), 
sufficient to brown it, but doing it slowly, and stirring it fre- 
quently to prevent its burning. Add 1 tablespoonful of flour 
to thicken it, and another of ketchup to flavour it ; and if you 
can get a tomata and a green capsicum, put them in also, 
with pepper and salt. Let it stew for full 8 hours, or until 
the quantity has been reduced to one half, when it will be 
quite sufficient for 6 or 8 people. 

PEASE-PORRIDGE.— E. R. 

7 1 . — Fry a couple of onions and a stick of celery, and put 
them, with a bundle of sweet herbs, a couple of anchovies, or 
•5- a red herring, into 3 quarts of water, with a crust of bread, 
pepper and salt ; boil all together very gently until the flavour 
is extracted from the herbs ; then skim the liquor, and strain 
it. Add a jDound of raw potatoes grated, and a pint of split 
peas ; when the peas are soft, rub them through a sieve with 
the soup, and if the porridge should not be thick enough, add 
a little flour and butter. Cut 6 leeks into pieces, and boil 
them in the soup, and send them to table. 

SPLIT PEA-SOUP.— E. R. 
72. — To 3 quarts of boiling water put a quart of whole or 
split peas ; boil gently until the peas are dissolved, then pulp 
them through a sieve, and add 3 anchovies or a red herring, 
carrots, turnips, leeks, thj^me, and sweet marjoram, and stew 
them together. Before serving, add some ketchup and salt, 
thicken the soup Ttith butter, and send it up with fried bread. 
Frying the bread will make the soup richer. The addition of 
mushroom-ketchup v.ill partly give it the flavour of meat. 

GREEN PEA-SOUP.— E. R. 

73. — Take 5 or 6 cucumbers, pared and sliced, the white 
part of as many cos-lettuces, a sprig or two of mint, 2 or 3 
onions, some pepper and salt, a full pint of young peas, a little 
parsley, and * lb. of butter. Put them all together in a sauce- 
pan to stew in their own liquor for an hour and a half, or until 
they are quite tender ; then boil as many old peas, pulp them 
through a colander, and mix in a quart of the liquor or more, 
according to the thickness which may be desirable : Allien the 
herbs are stewed put them in, and serve up. This soup vvill 
be found excellent. 

Or : — As used in Ilahj. — Boil a quart of peas in \ gallon 



102 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. VIL 

of water until tender enough to pulp through a coarse sieve ; 
then put the pulp, a cos-lettuce, 2 good-sized cucumbers sliced, 
and a pint of young peas, into the liquor. Stew gently, until 
the vegetables become extremely tender; then add pepper 
and salt, chopped mint, and 2 oz. of butter rubbed in a spoonful 
of flour, and boil 10 minutes. 

A mere elaborate method. — Slice a French roll, and boil it 
in 6 quarts of water until it is perfectly dissolved ; take all the 
old peas found in a peck and a half, keeping the young ones 
separate ; boil the old peas with the bread and water, and 
when tender strain them ; reserve the water, and pulp the 
peas through a sieve ; boil the young peas, with a sprig of 
mint, a little mace and pepper, in the strained soup, and while 
they are simmering put ^ lb. of butter into a frying-pan, and 
when it boils cut in 2 lettuces, 2 handfuls of young spinach, 
a little parsley chopped, a dozen of small silver onions, and 2 
cucumbers cut in slices. After stewing for some time, add a 
large tablespoonful of flour, the pulped peas, and then that 
which has the young peas in it, simmering the whole together 
for 10 minutes. 

POTATO SOUP. 

74. — Take some large mealy potatoes ; peel and cut them 
into small slices, with an onion ; boil them in 3 pints of water 
till tender, and then pulp them through a colander ; add a 
small piece of butter, a little cayenne jDepper and salt, and, 
just before the soup is served, 2 spoonfuls of good cream. The 
soup must not be allowed to boil after the cream has been put 
into it. 

N.B. — This will be found a most excellent soup, and, being 
easily and quickly made, is useful upon an emergency, when 
such an addition is suddenly required to the dinner. 

ONION SOUP. 
75. — Slice 12 large onions — Spanish, if they can be got — 
with a couple of turnips and 2 heads of celery. Fry them 
in ^ lb. of butter until quite brown, but not burnt. AYhen of 
a nice colour, put them into a gallon of boiling water, with 
either a soft-roed red herring, or 2 or 3 anchovies, or a table- 
spoonful of anchovy sauce, seasoned with a few blades of 
pounded mace and some grains of allspice, pepper, and saltj 
and let the whole stew until it :s tender enough to pulp. When 
ready, have the crumb of a couple of French rolls boiled in 



Chap. YIII. BEE1\ 103 

milk, and pass them with the vegetables through the colander. 
l*ut it again on the fire to stew for a few minutes till quite 
liot ; and if not sufficiently thick, add the yolks of raw eggs, 
to be beaten up into the soup when just going to be put on 
the table. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

BEEF. 

Beef is dresse-d in various ways all the year round ; but, for 
roasting^ the best season is from November to the end of 
March. The only really good roasting pieces are the sirloin 
and the long ribs ; the short ribs, wliich are cut near the neck, 
never roast well, and should not be used for this purpose ; the 
middle ribs are the best. The under part, or fillet, of the 
airloin, if cut out, may be made into a delicious stew ; or, if 
cut crosswise into steaks, they will be found more tender than 
those of the rump. 

Some persons divide the round, and roast the half called the 
upper side, which in young beef is tender and full of gravy. 
The silver side should be salted, being one of the best boiling 
pieces in the ox. The aitchbone, although almost invariably 
salted and boiled, yet, if roasted wlien fresh, makes perhaps the 
richest gravy of any part of the ox ; but, when cold, is not so 
good as if salted 

Beef requires to be hung a long time, in order to ensure its 
being tender. When, however, the weather is not favourable 
for doing so, it will be much improved by being laid for a few 
hours previous to roasting in a marinade of this kind — three 
parts water to one of vinegar, some salt, with a few pepper- 
corns. Each joint must be carefully examined before it is 
spitted, and any portions that may have been injured cut 
away. 

In Scotland, meat of every sort is preserved by covering it 
completely with oatmeal, taking it out every day, wiping it, 
and then replacing it in the meal ; and should it appear at all 
tainted, it is soaked for some hours in oatmeal and water before 
being dressed : or strewing over it some coarsely-powdered 
eiiarcoal will materially assist in its preservation. 



104 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Ylll. 

BIBS OF BEEF BOASTED. 
76. — Cut out the chine-bones from the thick end of the ribs, 
and also the strong sinew or leather ; fasten the •' bark," or 
outside fat, with a few skewers ; spit it through the thick part 
and the point of the ribs. When one or two ribs are purchased 
by a small family, it is a good plan to have the bones taken 
out, and the meat rolled round in the shape of a fillet ; a con- 
siderable saving is effected by this plan, as, when not so pre- 
pared, the thin part at the extremity of the bone is frequently 
wasted. The bone cut out when the meat is raw will assist 
in making soup, and is much preferable to a cold beef-bone. 
They are sometimes cut off short, and salted or stewed, but 
rolling is tlie better plan : and in th.is manner a single rib can 
be skewered into a handsome fillet ; the fat and lean being 
marbled, and the appearance of the whole improved. 

TO COLLAB BIBS OF BEEF. 

77. — Take 2 or 3 ribs of beef; cut the meat from the 
bones ; rub it well with salt, brown sugar, and saltpetre ; let 
it remain a fortnight, turning it every day ; then season it 
with pepper, m.ace, . cloves, allspice, and a clove of garlic 
chopped very fine ; cover it well with parsley, thyme, and 
sv/ eet marjoram ; roll it up very tight, and bind it round 
v^^ith tape ; put it into a pot with some Avater, cover it close 
up, and send it to the oven to be baked very slowly 3 or 4 
hours : then take it out, and press it between 2 boards with 
weights. This is an excellent dish for luncheon or breakfast. 

A Marinade io baste .Roast Meats. — Chop up some fat 
bacon with a clove of garlic and a sprig of parsley ; add salt, 
pepper, a spoonful of vinegar, and 4 spoonfuls of oil ; beat it 
up well, and baste the meat with it. 

SIBLOIN OF BEEF BOASTED. 
78. — Break the upper part of the chine-bones, cut them 
out, and cut through the strong gristle on the top, and skewer 
it in its place, which will prevent its drawing up or looking 
unsightly. Run the spit just under the bark at the thin end, 
and bring it out between the joints. By spitting it thus you 
avoid showing where tlie spit has gone through. Cover the 
fat witli a sheet of buttered paper, and roast gently for 3 or 4 
hours, according to the size of the joint. The under part is 
sometimes stuffed with forcemeat, in the following manner : — 



Chap. YIJI. 



BEEF. 



lOo 




Sirloin. 



Carefully lift up the fat from the inside of the sirloin witli 
a sharp knife ; take out all the meat close to the bone, and 
mince it small ; take 
* lb. of suet, and 
chop it fine ; mix 
with it some grated 
bread - crumbs, a 
little lemon - peel, 
thyme, and slialot 
minced very fine ; 
mix all together 
v\dth a glass of port 
wine ; put it back 
again into the same 
place, and cover it 
with the skin and 
fiit ; skewer it down neatly with small wooden skewers, and 
cover it with paper. The meat should be spitted before you 
take out the inside ; and when done do not take off the paper 
until the joint is put into the dish : then serve it up garnished 
with scraped horseradisli. 

The method of taking the meat from the bone, and rolling 
it so as to have the forcemeat in the middle, is easier, but adds 
its flavour to the whole joint ; while this way keeps tlie upper 
and the under part separate. 

To dress the inside of a StJ-Join, cut it out in one piece, if 
not used at table ; stcAv It with good broth or gravy, a little 
spice, and a tablespoonful of walnut-ketchuD. Serve witli 
chopped pickles. 

To dress the inside of a cold Sirloin, cut out all the meat, 
and a little fat into pieces as thick as your finger, and 4 mches 
long ; dredge them with flour, and fry in butter of a nice 
brown : drain the butter from the meat, and toss it up in a 
rich gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, anchovy, and shalot. 
Do not let it boil. Add 2 spoonfuls of vinegar and a glass oc 
port wine. Garnish with crimped parsley. 

Or : — Cut the meat in slices about 4 inches long, and ^ an 
inch thick, the fat with the lean ; season them with pepper 
and salt, and fry them in butter ; have ready some good 
brown gravy, and stew them gently for ^ an hour ; add a 
little mushroom ketchup, and a tablespoonful of shalot \inegar

with a wine-glass of port, and just before serving put in a 
small piece of butter rolled in fiour. This part is called the 
'• Fillet," and, when raw, may be either stewed whole or in 
tlie above manner. 

FILLET OF BEEF. 

79. — To dress the inside of a Sirloin of Beef to taste like 
Hare. — Take the inside of a large -sirloin tliat has hung until 
tender ; soak it 24 hours in a fev/ glasses of port wine and 
vinegar. Have ready a good stuffing as for hare ; do not 
spread, but put it into the middle of the beef, and roll it up 
tight. Roast it on a hanging spit, and baste it with a glass of 
the wine and vinegar, mixed with a teaspoonful of Jamaica 
j3epper, and a clov^ or two, in the finest powder, until it is all 
dried up ; then baste with butter. Serve v>^ith a rich gravy in 
the dish, and currant-jelly sauce. 

EU3IP OF BEEF. 

80. — If of a well-fed ox, and hung till tender, this is one of 
the most juicy and best flavoured of all the joints of beef, but 
is more frequently stewed than roasted. It is generally sold 
in the country undivided from the aitchbone ; or cut across, 
and not lengthwise, as in London, which makes it too large for 
one dressing, and neither fit for boiling nor roasting. 

At family dinners, a Yorkshire pudding is a usual accom- 
paniment. 

TO STEir BEEF. 

81. — It should be put in a pot with just sufficient cold 
water to cover it, and closely covered. After boiling 3 or 4 
hours, according to the size of the piece, cut in small pieces, not 
larger than dice, 2 or 3 carrots and heads of celery, with a 
little sweet herbs, and put them into the pot along with pepper- 
corns, mace, and a couple of large onions stuck full of cloves, 
and let it then simmer by the side of the fire for 2 or 3 hours, 
taking care to skim off any fat that may appear on the top. 

By this time the meat will probably be tender enough ; 
when take out the whole onions, mince them, and fry tliem in 
butter, to be mixed in the gravy made by the meat, which 
season with salt and cayenne, or chili -vinegar, to which add 
some mushroom or walnut ketchup. Thicken the gravy with 
a little flour, and brov.'n it, if necessary, with a spoonful of 
sugar slightly burnt ; which, besides imparting its colour; 



Chap. ^' III.

adds an agreeable flavour. Such is the most simple mode ; 
but the sauce may 
be much improved 
by a glass or two 
of port wine and 
a spoonful of cuny 
powder ; if the odour 
of garlic be not ob- 
jected to, a clove 
boiled in the stev/ 
will be found to give Stewed Beef. 

it a fine flavour. Garnish with vegetables. 

A small piece of beef — say of 4 lbs. — will take the time 
mentioned ; but the large joints will require full double that 
time. 

Mump of Beef Stew. — Half-roast it ; then put it into a pot 
with 3 pints of water, a pound of sliced bacon, a bunch of 
sweet herbs, 2 v/ine-glasscs of vinegar, and a bottle of cider or 
small wine ; stick cloves into a couple of large onions, add a 
few sage-leaves, and cover the beef closely, adding more water 
should there not be sufficient gravy from the meat. Let it 
simmer for 3 hours ; then strain the gravy. Boil or bake 
some button onions, and lay them round the beef ; cover i i 
also with forcemeat-balls, fried ornaments of paste, and mush- 
rooms, if in season ; add to the gravy a glass of port wine, a 
spoonful of soy and Oude sauce ; boil down a part to a glaze, 
and put it on the beef : thicken the remainder if necessary, 
and pour it round, garnishing the dish with pickles. 

Or: — Season it high with cayenne, salt, allspice, cloves, and 
a blade of mace, all in fine powder. Bind it up tight, and lay 
it into a pot that will just hold it ; resting it on 2 or 3 twigs, 
to prevent the meat from sticking.' Fry 3 large onions sliced, 
and put them to it, with carrots, turnips, a shalot, a blade of 
mace, and some celery. Cover the meat with good beef-brotli, 
and simmer it as gently as possible for several hours until 
quite tender. Clear off the fat ; and add to the gravy \ pint 
of port v/ine, a small glass of chili vinegar, and a large spoon- 
ful of ketchup ; simmer ^ an hour, and serve in a deep dish. 
The herbs to be used should be burnet, tarragon, parsley, 
thym.e, basil, marjoram, and all or any of the most savoury 
sort. 

Gr : — Prepare the beef as directed in the foregoing receipts, 



108 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. VIII. 

and glaze it twice ; stew some white haricot beans in good 
brown gravy, with an onion sliced, a carrot, some parsley, and 
a bunch of sweet herbs, a clove of garlic, a bay-leaf, and a 
slice of lean ham ; let all simmer gently together till the beans 
are sufficiently tender ; then separate them from the other 
vegetables; and put them in a sieve to drain ; pass the sauce 
and vegetables through a tammy, add a tablespoonful of vine- 
gar, and, if not thick enough, a bit of butter rolled in flour ; 
put in the haricot beans, make all boiling hot, and pour the 
sauce into tlie dish round the beef. 

Brisket of Beef Stewed. — Stew it in sufficient water to 
cover the meat ; when quite tender, take out the bones, and 
skim off the fat ; add to the gravy, when strained, a glass of 
wine and a little spice tied up in a muslin bag. Ha^'e ready 
either mushrooms, truffles, or vegetables boiled, and cut into 
shajDes. Lay them on and round the beef ; reduce part of the 
gravy to a glaze, lay it on the top, and pour the remainder 
into the dish. 

It is a good piece to stew, as it may be cut from the bone, 
and of any size. 

Leg of Beef Stewed. — Salt 6 lbs. of the half-leg, or marrow- 
bone of beef, for 3 or 4 days. Make holes in it about H inch 
deep, and press in, very hard, forcemeat made in the following 
manner : H lb. of suet sliced very fine, pepper, salt, and a 
few cloves, some winter savory, and sweet marjoram, mixed 
well together. The beef must be baked in a deep pan, with 
water reaching about three-quarters of the way up, and force- 
meat spread over the top, which, when the meat is baked, is 
taken off, cut into shapes, and laid round the dish. 

BO VILLI. 

82. — The rump of beef is best for this purpose, as the meat 
IS to be served up in a separate dish, and will make a finely- 
flavoured soup. Take for a small party from 4 to 6 lbs., with 
2 or 3 large roasted or^'^ns, in one of which stick some cloves, 
with a modera^.e quantity of whole pepper, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and an anchovy : put it into a stewpan, covered with 
rather more than a pint of cold water to every pound of meat, 
and let it simmer by the side of the fire for 4 or 5 hours, or 
until it has become quite tender. Then take out the herbs and 
onions, and add carrots, turnips, and celery, either cut into 



Chap. VIII. BEEF. 109 

small squares or sliced, and let the whole boil until sufficiently 
stewed, and ready for the table. 

The soup should then be strained off, and served separately, 
leaving only so much as may be necessary for making sauce 
for the vegetables. The sauce should be a little thickened 
and seasoned ; if a clove of garlic, or a teaspoonful of garlic 
and chili vinegar, be added, it will improve the flavour. In 
Ireland it is not uncommon to send up the bouilli smothered 
in onion-sauce, the other vegetables being either not used, or 
brought up in the soup ; in France it is very usual to dress 
cabbage and sausages as an accompaniment to the bouilli ; 
but, in England, it is more customary to serve it up with the 
vegetable-sauce as above stated. Cucumbers cut into dice 
and stewed, with a spoonful of chili vinegar added, are served 
at most of the German hotels. The meat, if gently stewed 
until quite tender, without being boiled to rags, will be found 
excellent, and the whole an admirable dish. 

Another: — Take a handsome piece of brisket of 10 lbs. 
weiglit ; put it over the fire with a small quantity of water 
until the gravy is out ; add a very large bunch of parsley, 
pepper, salt, and an onion, ^yhen the gravy is drawn, add 
2 gallons of boiling water, and let it stew until perfectly 
tender ; chop the parsley, and lay it on the top of the meat, 
thicken the gravy with vegetables, and serve it up. 

The tops of the long ribs make good bouilli, simmered in a 
small quantity of water, and served on a bed of red cabbage, 
stewed separately, and flavoured with a glass of vinegar. It 
also eats excellently, if, when simply boiled, it is served up 
smothered with onion sauce. 

Hihs of beef, though rarely dressed en bouilli, are yet most 
excellent when so prepared. Take the middle of the flat ribs 
of beef, stew it until the meat is tender and the bones will 
come out, using as small a quantity of water as will cover the 
meat, and a bundle of sweet herbs. Let it stand until it is 
cold, remove the fat, add to the gravy, carrots, turnips, and 
celery, cut in dice, and a dozen or two of small silver onions ; 
warm up the beef in it, and send it to table. 

B(EUF TREMBLANT.—E. R. 
83. — Cut a handsome piece of beef from the rump, either 
a fillet or square ; hang it up for 4 days, then put it all niglit 
to soak in a pickle of salt and vinegar ; put it into a stewpan, 



no MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. YIIL 

and let it be covered with water ; add a seasoning of whole 
pepper and salt, a bundle of sweet herbs, and an onion. Let 
it simmer very slowly as long as it will hang together, taking 
care to skim it well. Strain the gravy, and add to it carrots 
previously boiled, and cut into pieces an inch long ; add also 
a few capers and a mushroom, with a glass of wine and the 
juice of a lemon. "When the beef has been sufficiently stewed 
take it up, and set it for a short time in a Dutch oven, and 
glaze it, or brown it with a salamander. 

A small rump of beef may be dressed in the same manner. 

In France, besides the pot-aii-feu already described, it is 
very usual to stew about 3 lbs. of beef with a small piece of 
liver and a veal bone, or the remains of a fowl, with its head 
and claws, in 2 quarts of water put into an earthen vessel and 
placed beside a wood-fire early in the morning, so as to be 
ready by dinner-time. 

When the meat has boiled once, it is skimmed and salted ; 
carrots, turnips, with a fried onion and any vegetables in 
season, are minced and allowed to simmer gently in it until 
the whole contents are stewed tender ; but the meat is served 
separately, and thin slices of bread are put into the broth to 
thicken it, unless rice or vermicelli be employed for that pur- 
pose. It makes an ample meal for 8 to 10 hearty persons, as 
soup is not, in that country, usually made very strong of the 
meat. 

In Germany nearly the same practice is follovred throughout 
the greater part of the country ; only that sm.all sausages and 
chopped cabbage are more used than either rice or vermicelli, 
and that sour cream is substituted for paste as thickening. 
The quantity of m-eat is also smaller, and the vegetables, which 
form the chief part of the stew, are all fried in dripping ; the 
whole mess is also brought to table. Cold meat is seldom 
brought to table, being generally pounded and made up into 
moulds, covered with bread-crumbs and browned ; but in no 
instance is cayenne or any sort of pepper largely used, and 
often entirely omitted. 

A FAMILY STEW OF BEEF.—E.R. 

84. — Take any piece of beef good for stewing, cut it into 
small pieces, slice 2 or 3 large onions, and put them into tlie 
stev/pan with 2 ounces of butter or good beef-dripping. When 
melted, dredge in some flour, add the meat also dredged v/ith 



i 



Chap. YIII. BEEF. Ill 

iioiir, and enough water to keep it from burning. When the 
gravy has drawn, fill up with boiling vrater, let it come to a 
l3oil gently, skim the pot well, then add a spoonful of mixed 
spices and a bay-leaf or two ; set the pan by tlie side of the 
fire to stew slowly for a couple of hours. 1 1 lbs. of meat will 
take 4 hours. This dish may be thickened like Irish stew, 
with potatoes, or it may be served with the addition of chopped 
vegetables of all kinds, previously fried. 

STEWED BEEF-STEAKS.— E.B. 

85. — Put the steak with a lump of butter into a stewpan 
over a slow fire, and turn it until the butter has become a fine 
white gravy, then pour it into a basin, and put more butter to 
the steak. When the steak is nicely done, take it out, return 
all the gravy into the stewpan, and fry the steak ; then add it 
to the gravy in the stewpan, with a tablespoonful of wine, and 
a shalot finely sliced ; stew it for 10 minutes, and serve it up. 
Or, fry the steak slightly at first, then put it into -5- pint of 
v/ater, an onion sliced, a spoonful of wahiut ketchup, pepper 
and salt, cover it close, thicken it with flour and butter, and 
serve it up very hot. 

With Vegetables. — Cut the steak about 2i inches thick ; 
dredge it with flour, and fry it in butter, of a fine brown. Lay 
it in a stewpan, and pour water into the frying-pan ; let it boil, 
and add it to the steak, wliich is rendered riclier by this pro- 
cess ; slice in turnips, carrots, celery, and onions, adding 
pepper, salt, and a little mace. It should be highly seasoned, 
and sent to table with the surface ornamented with forcemeat 
balls, carrots and turnips cut into shapes, and sometimes v«^ith 
onion fritters, the vegetables to be put round it. 

With Oysters. — Cut the steak rather thick ; brown it in a 
frying-pan with butter. Add ^ jnnt of water, an onion sliced, 
pepper and salt, cover the pan close, and let it stew very 
slowly for 1 hour ; then add a glass of port wine, a little flour, 
and a dozen or two of oysters, their liquor having been pre^ 
viously strained and put into the stewpan. 

With Cucumhers, it may be dressed the same way, only 
using white wine instead of port ; the cucumbers to be stewed 
separately in a little gravy or broth, and added to the beef o 
minutes before serving ; fry the cucumbers, and stew them in 



112 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chaj. VJIl. 

the water poured into the pan after the fat is poured off; ii 
stewed with the steak they will make it hard. 

A distinction should be always made between Rump-steak 
and Beef -steak, as the latter is very^inferior ; but a slice cut 
from the sirloin is most excellent. 

BROILED RUMP-STEAK.— E. R. 

86. — Cut the steaks about f inch thick, from a rump of beef 
that has hung until quite tender ; let the gridiron be hot, well 
rubbed with beef suet, and the fire clear. Lay on the steaks, 
one by one, turning them frequently with steak-tongs — a fork 
should never be used ; when brov/n on both sides, lay them on 
a hot dish, and send them instantly to table, for, if not eaten 
hot, the steak will become soddened. Should it not have hung 
long enough to be tender, beat it with a rolling-pin ; put no 
salt on, or it will harden the steak. The grand secret is a quick 
clear fire, frequent turning, and quick cooking ; for if the meat 
be long upon the fire it will be hard. 

As regards turning it frequently or only once, that must 
depend upon whether the steak is to be done in the usual wa}^, 
— that the gra^'y may not be drawn out on either side ; or 
whether it is to be done " rare " — that is to say, very much 
under^QiWQ. In the former case, the steak should be cut only 
}% inch thick and turned frequently — but, if " rare," \ inch 
thick, turning it only once, and the fire should be more brisk 
than in the former case ; by which means the meat will be 
sufficiently scorched on both sides, without being burned. It 
is not eaten in perfection if served with anything else ; a little 
minced shalot and a tablespoonful of ketchup may be put into 
the dish, and it may be garnished with horseradish : to pepper 
the steak is to spoil it. 

Such is the mode of dressing it at Bellamy's of the House of 
Commons, at the Blue Posts in Cork Street, and at all the 
chop-houses around the Eoyal Exchange. The steak, if largo 
enough, should be cut into two ; one part being sent up first, 
and the remainder afterwards, this second course being always 
the best. 

10 minutes will be sufficient to cook a large steak if it is 
to be done rare; but if well done, from 10 to 15 minutes. 

The fat should be separated and put on the gridiron first 
and taken off" last, so as to broil it half as long again as the 
lean. That makes it pulpy, like marrow. 



Chap. VIIT. BEEF. 113 \ 

TO BOIL BEEF. -t-^ 

87. — Hound of Beef . — Supposing it to be from 20 to 30 lbs. \ 

weight, and very salt,"" soak it in 2 waters ; wash it well, and i 

take out the bone ; the cavity made by its remo"\^al may be ' 
plugged up with fat ; then skeY\-er the meat up with the flap 
round it, and bind it firmly with several folds of strong tape ; 
put it into a large pot, well covered with cold water, and put 
it upon a moderate fire, to let it boil slowly, that it may heat 
gradually all through ; take off the scum as it rises, and, when 
no more appears, keep the pot closely covered. Turn the 
meat tv/ice while it is boiling ; and, about 2 hours before it 

is done, put in some carrots, cut into large pieces ; if you i 

have parsnips, let them be m.ashed ; but if you use greens or j 

cabbage, boil them separately ; and, v/ith boiled salt beef, ^ 

never use turnips. : 

A round of this size will take full 6 hours to boil it pro- 
perly ; that is to say, neither too much over nor under done ; 

and, if only of 12 to 15 lbs., will require from 4 to 5 hours. \ 

To bod a Rump of Beef. — Mix some common salt, a little \ 

saltpetre, some parsley, thyme, marjoram, green onions, \ 

pepper, and salt, and rub all Vv^ell into the meat, and let it lie \ 

3 or 4 days ; then put it into a pot, and fill it with water ; add j 

some celerj', with 2 or 3 sliced carrots, and small whole | 

onions ; let it boil gently for 3 or 4 hours, according to the i 
size, and serve with the vegetables neatly placed in the dish. 

The other joints that are usually salted and boiled are t>'' J 

aitchbone and the brisket. I 

B UBBLE-AND-S Q UEAK.—E. R, \ 

88. — Cut slices from a cold boiled round or rump of beef, j 

let them be fried quickly until brown, and put them into a . 
dish to be kept hot. Clean the pan from the fat ; put into it 

greens and carrots previously boiled and chopped small, or, ; 

instead of these, large onions sliced thin and fried, though \ 

sometimes only greens are used. Add a little butter, pepper, ; 

and salt ; make the vegetables very hot, and put them round ] 

the beef with a little gravy. ! 

Cold boiled pork is thought by some to be a better material 
ioi bubble-and-squeak than beef, which is sometimes hard. 

In either case the slices should be very thin, and lightly fried. . 

^ 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of comraoa salt, and 2 oz. of Lrown sugar, will ' 

be sufficient for 16 lbs. of beef. : 



114 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Ylf L 

BAKED BEEF. 

89.-^4 Rump of 20 to 26 lbs. weight.— Take 2 oz. 
each of pepper and allspice, ^ oz. of pounded cloves, and 
fhe same quantity of mace ; rub this all over the joint, which 
should be hung up for a fortnight or three weeks, according to 
the weather — taking care to keep it dry, and occasionally to 
renew the seasoning. When ready for baking, wash off the, 
spice with port vv^ine, and lard tlie rump throughout — not in 
the common mode used by poulterers, but by inserting large 
\ardoons in different parts of the meat. Then put a large 
quantity of suet, shred fine, both under and over it, and cover 
it with coarse flour-and-water paste, between which and the 
suet you may put a few bay-leaves or some sweet herbs. If 
eaten hot, the dough, bay-leaves, and suet must all be taken 
off; the joint basted, sprinkled with a little salt and flour, 
over which a salamander should be passed ; and served up 
witli strong gravy or brown sauce. If cold, leave on the 
dough till wanted. 

It should be baked in a moderately-heated oven, and will 
take, according to the size, from 6 to 8 hours' baking. 

A Mound of Beef Yn2iy be dressed in the same manner ; but 
tlie bone should in that case be taken out, and the hole filled 
up with forcemeat. The flap should be filled in like manner, 
skewered, and tightly bound round with linen or strong tape, 
in which case the dough and the larding may be omitted, 
tliough the latter will be found an improvement. It should 
be eaten cold. 

Brisket. — Take all the bones out of 8 lbs. of the brisket of 
beef; make holes in it about an inch asunder, and fill one with 
fat bacon, a second with parsley, a third with oysters, and so 
on, each being chopped and seasoned with pepper, salt, nut- 
meg, and cloves. When completely stuffed, lay it in a pan, 
dredge it well with flour, ponr upon it h pint of port, and the 
same of broth. Bake it 3 hours, and then skim off the fat ; 
put the meat into a dish, strain the gravy over, and garnish 
with pickles. 

Any piece of fresh beef, even of the coarsest pieces, may be 
dressed in this manner, or baked before the fire in a Dutcli 
oven with button onions, the meat being previously rubbed 
over with oil. This is a common mode in Portugal and 
Spain, the forcemeat and spice being omitted ; but the beef 



Chap. Ann. BEEF. 115 

is always larded with pledgets of bacon of the size of a woman's 
little finger, inserted into several punctures throughout the 
inside of the meat, to which are added some cloves of garlic, 
and the piece covered with thick brown sauce when brought 
to table, 

Scarlet Beef. — Take 3 lbs. of tender lean beef from the 
round, and rub it well with the following ingredients : — Mix 
equal proportions of mace, allspice, black pepper, salt, sugar, 
and saltpetre. Rub this well into the meat ; let it lie 5 or 
G days, turning it daily, and repeatedly rubbing in the mix- 
ture ; then roll it and tie it firmly round with wide tape ; put 
it into ajar which will just hold it, with the spice, and a little 
beef-suet over and under it ; tie it down close, and bake it 
p,ently until tender. It is eaten cold, and should be cut in 
ihin slices and garnished with parsley. 

Ajwtlier icay to dress Scarlet Beef. — Take a brisket or 
thin flank of beef, and rub it well all over with equal quan- 
tities of common and bay salt, and an ounce of saltpetre ; let 
it remain for 4 or 5 days in an earthen pan, when it will 
become red ; it should be turned once every day. Boil it 
gently for 4 hours, and serve it hot, with savoys or any kind 
of greens ; or press it with a weight, and leave it to get cold. 

If served up hot, add a wineglassful of port wine, a table- 
spoonful of mushroom-ketchup, a teaspoonful of shalot-vinegar, 
and some butter rolled in flour, to ^ a pint of gravy. Place 
the meat neatly in the dish, and pour the sauce over it. 

TO HASH BEEF. 

90. — If tl^c meat is ratv, hang it till it is quite tender ; then 
cut some thin slices, and put them into a stewpan with just 
water enough to cover them, a bunch of sweet-herbs, an oiiion, 
and a little pepper and salt ; cover the stewpan close, and let 
them stew till tender : then put in a glass of port wine, and a 
tablespoonful of shalot-vinegar. When it is vrarm, pour the 
gravy througli a hair sieve to clear it from the herbs and vege- 
tables ; then put it back into the saucepan with the hash, and 
thicken it with butter kneaded in flour, with a little brown 
sugar. This is an excellent dish, and may be made from the 
trimmings of large joints of meat. 

If the 7neat luis been cooked., mince a shaiot and an onion ; 
fry in a little butter ; then add a spoonful of flour^ a little 



116 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. YIII, 

gravy, and a spoonfiil of walnut-liquor or ketchup, "When it 
boils, put in the slices of beef cut thin ; let them get hot 
through, but not boiled. Sliced j)otatoes and onions may be 
added if approved. 

Observe that it is owing to hoiling hashes or minces that 
they get hard. All sorts of stews, or meat dressed a second 
time, should be only simmered. 

BEEF HEAR T. 

91. — If the ox be not young, the heart will be strong in 
flavour, and should be soaked the night before in vinegar and 
water. Though looked upon as a coarse and rather vulgar 
dish, it is yet very economical for a large family, and may be 
dressed in various ways, so as to render it very palatable. 

To roast. —Soak it overnight, and then wash and clean it 
very well ; take cut all the white thick skin, and fill it with 
stuffing of a savoury description, having a larger proportion of 
marjoram than usual ; make a strong gravy, and sei.'ve it up 
with currant-jelly sauce. It should not be spitted, but hung- 
from an upright jack ; but the better way is to bake it for 4 or 
5 hours in a slow oven, and either lard it profusely or baste it 
frequently with butter. Its appearance and flavour may be 
much improved by dividing it in half, covering it v/ith slices 
of fat bacon, laying the forcemeat over it, rolling it round, 
and dressing it in either way as above. The other half will 
make excellent beef a-la-mode. 

It is a good plan to dj'ess beef-heart in this way a day before 
roasting or baking a harOg, as, when cold and both hashed to- 
gether, they can scarcely be distinguished from each other. 
liV^hen there is no hare, hash the heart the same way by cutting 
it in slices, warming it in gravy with a glass of port wine and 
melted currant-jelly. 

To stew, — Either take one-half or the whole of the heart, 
stuffed as above, and put it into the stewpan, not more than 
covered with beef-gravy and a pint of red wine, with spice and 
sugar ; or put only beer, spiced and sugared in the same 
wanner, keeping the pan all the time closely covered. 

OX- CHEEK. 
92. — Soak half a head for 3 hours if it be young and 
tender ; or, if not, soak it the day before it is to be eaten ; 
wash it very thoroughly ; then put it into a stewpan, or into an 



CiiAP. yill BEEF. 1.17 

earthen pan to bake, Vvdtli 2 quarts of water, and let it simmei 
for 8 hours, with an onion stuck with cloves, a head of celery^ 
a bundle of sweet-herbs, and some whole pepper ; in 2 hours, 
add plenty of carrots, leeks, and, lastly, two or three turnips. 
When ready, take out the head, remove the meat from the 
bones, and cut it neatly ; strain the gra"vy, remove all the fat, 
make some nice forcemeat-balls, and v;arm them with the 
meat and gravy, to which add a glass of wine. 

To steiv Ox-cheek. — Clean the head nicely, then soak it for 
some hours in cold water ; put it into a stewpan, and let it 
simmer gently till it is quite tender ; then take out the bones^ 
and tie the meat up in a cloth ; put a weight upon it, and let 
it stand till the next day ; make a forcemeat of any white meat, 
and boil six eggs hard ; cut the cheek in slices ; put some at 
the bottom of a dish, then a layer of forcemeat, then one of 
the sliced eggs, another of meat, and so on till the dish is full ; 
season with pepper and salt, and pour in as much of the gravy 
as the dish will hold ; either stew it in the usual way, or cover 
it with a coarse paste and send it to the oven to be baked 
slowly. The paste to be removed before brought to table. 

BEEF TONGUE. 

93. — If it has been dried and smoked, before it is dressed it 
should be soaked overnight ; 
but if only pickled, a few 
hours will be sufficient. Put 
it into cold water, and set it 
over a slow fire for an hour 
or two before it comes to a 
boil ; then put it aside, and 
keep it simmering for 3^ to 
4 hours, according to its Tongue Garnished. 

size : you can ascertain when it is done by probhig it with a 
skewer. Peel it, trim the root, glaze it, and before serving 
surromid the root with a paper frill, and stick a flower or 
two on the top over windpipe. 

Its appearance, and its flavour also, may be improved by 
rubbing it over, when skinned, with yolk of egg, on which 
crumbs of bread and finely-minced sweet-herbs may be strewed , 
then slightly basting it with butter, and brov/ning it with a 
salamander.

To stew Tongue. — Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common 
salt for a week, turning it every day ; boil it tender enough 
to peel ; when done, stew it with a moderately strong gravy, 
seasoned with soy, mushroom-ketchup, cayenne-pepper, 
pounded cloves, and salt if necessary. Serve with trutiies, 
morels, and mushroom.s stewed in gravy. 

An excellent loay of preparing Tongues to eat cold, — Season 
with common salt and saltpetre, brown sugar, a little bay- 
salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, for a 
fortnight ; then take away the pickle, put the tongue into a 
small pan, and lay some butter on it ; cover it with brown 
crust, and bake it slowly till so tender that a straw will go 
through it ; put it into a tin mould, and press it well, laying 
in as m.uch of the fat as possible. 

The thin part of tongues, if hung up to dry, grates like 
hung beef, and also makes a fine addition to the flavour of 
omelets. 

To roast a Beef Tongue. — Take a fine large fresh tongue, 
scald it, and take off the skin ; cut it off" at the root and trim 
it neatly ; stick a few cloves here and there in it, and put it 
in a cradle-spit ; sprinkle it with salt, and baste it well with 
butter. Serve it with a sauce made as follows : — Put into a 
stewpan ^ pint of port wine, with about half the quantity of 
well-seasoned gravy ; reduce it to one-half; then stir in a 
good piece of butter and a tablespoonful of flour ; add a 
squeeze of lemon ; place the tongue in a dish, and serve hot 
with the sauce poured round. In Spain, the sauce is strongly 
impregnated with saffron. 

Afresh 7ieafs tongue and udder may be roasted together in 
the same way ; the same sauce may be served up with the 
tongue and udder ; garnish the dish with slices of lemon. The 
udder should be stuck with cloves, and both should be con- 
tinually basted. 

A la Parisienne. — Put the tongue into a large stewpan 
with the claws, heads, or trimmings of fowl, an onion stuck 
with cloves, a bundle of sweet-herbs, some pepper and salt, at 
first a small quantity of water, adding more afterwards. It 
should be cooked the day before it is wanted, and will be 
found an elegant and economical dish, as it will furnish the 
gravy necessary for all the sauces at a dinner-jjarty. Any 
parings of meat or poultry, ham or bacon bones, may ])e put

with it. Reduce some of the gravy to a glaze ; put the tongue 
into the oven to make it hot, glaze it, put it on a dish, and 
place flowers cut in turnips and carrots at each end. 

Langue de Bmuf pique. — Having removed the roct and 
gullet of a small neat's tongue, rub it well with salt ; next day 
hang it to drain, and wipe it. Let it lie in salt 1 day, boil it 
i an hour, blanch and remove the skin ; then, having rolled 
•some fresh-cured fat bacon in a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, with parsley, knotted 
marjoram, chives or chibols, and a little morsel of garlic minced 
small, lard the tongue all over, except a little space up the 
middle, where it is to be divided from the root to the tip ; 
braize and glaze as usual, having, after it is dressed, cut it in 
two, except at the two extremities, and thus lay it on the dish 
in the form of a heart. 

Larded a la Prusse. — Boil the tongue gently for 3 hours, 
then peel and lard it with bacon ; take some of the liquor it 
was boiled in ; fry a dozen or two of silver onions : add a glass 
of wine, a little flour, a lump of sugar, and the juice of half a 
lemon ; stew the whole together for another hour. 

OX-TAILS. 
94. — Cut the tails into pieces ; lay them in a stewpan, with 
butter and a large onion, and brown them ; peel and boil a 
couple of dozen of button onions in aboitt 3 pints of water, 
for 15 or 20 minutes ; set them by, and pour the liquor they 
were boiled in upon the tails, adding sufficient boiling water 
to cover them ; put in 6 ounces of carrots, and 8 of turnips, 
cut into slices, or balls the size of nutmegs ; put in the carrots 20 
minutes before the turnips. Be careful that they are not stewed 
too fast or too much. When they are tender, pass the gravy 
through a sieve ; skim ofl" the fat with great care while the 
tails are stewing. Keep the meat and vegetables hot. 
Thicken the gravy by putting an ounce of butter into a stew- 
pan ; when melted, stir in as much flour as will stiffen it. 
Pour the gravy in by degrees, stirring it till it boils ; strain it 
through a sieve into a stewpan, and let it simmer gently till 
the meat and vegetables are dished. Lay the tails round the 
dish, and the vegetables in the middle ; pour the gravy over ; 
minced gherkins or capers may be added. Pour boiling water 
over the, onions to warm them, and put them round the dish 
the last thing. 



120 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. YIII. 

Or : — Divide them at tlie joints, blanch, and parboil them ; 
put them into a stewpan with just vrater, or weak broth, 
enough to cover them ; let them simmer over a gentle fire, and 
remove the scum carefully as it rises ; then put in an onion, a 
blade of mace, and a little pepper and salt ; put them on again 
10 simmer, and when sufficiently done add a spoonful of essence 
of anchovy and some flour rolled in butter. This is an excel- 
lent and nourishing dish. 

TRIFE. 
95. — Tripe may be dressed in several ways, but, whatever 
mode may be employed, it will always be found an improve- 
ment to soak it for a whole night in milk. Indeed, if left in 
the milk until that gets sour, the acidity thus imparted to it 
will render it still better. 

To boil Tripe. — Put it into hot milk and water, an equal 
quantity of each ; milk may be entirely omitted, or that used 
in which it may have been soaked ; let it boil until quite 
tender. Boil several large onions in 2 waters, so as to dimi- 
nish their flavour ; or if Spanish onions can be got, they should 
be preferred. When quite tender, slice the onions into small 
flakes, but leave them in that state, and do not mash them 
into smooth sauce ; put the onions into a casserole with milk 
and butter, so as to make a delicate v/hite sauce, and season it 
only with a little salt, or a slight grating of nutmeg ; then 
put the tripe, hot from the pot, into a deep dish, and smother 
it entirely with the sauce. It is usually eaten with pepper 
and mustard. Oyster-sauce is sometimes used, and much 
approved. 

To roast Trijye. — Cut the tripe in square pieces ; make a 
rich forcemeat, spread it over the pieces of tripe, and roll them 
up tightly ; fasten them upon a spit, flour and baste them well, 
and serve them up with melted butter and slices of Seville 
orange or lemon. 

To /?•?/.— Dip it into batter of flour and eggs, and fry '"^ of 
a good brown. Serve with onions fried. 

To stew. — Simmer it in beef or veal gravy ; thicken it with 
batter rolled in a very little flour, and add a spoonful of mush- 
room-ketchup. Or boil it tender in milk, and serve with white 
sauce. 

Tripe and Z'i"!-n€Ua~^ance. — Select some double tripe ; boil 



Chap. Till. BEEK 121 

it until tender ; let it cool ; cut it into small pieces ; dip them 
HI egg and bread-crumbs ; fry them a light brown ; serve with 
tomata-sauce. 

COW-HEELS. 

96. — Ox-feet, or Cow-heels, are not highly esteemed, but 
they contain much nutriment, and may be dressed in the 
various ways already stated for tripe, with which they are com- 
monly boiled. They are frequently eaten cold, with mustard 
and vinegar. 

Soak them well ; boil, and serve in a napkin, with thick 
melted butter, a large spoonful of vinegar, and a little mustard 
and salt. Or boil, and then stew them in a brovrn gravy. Or 
cut the heel in four parts, dip each in egg, flour, and fry them 
in butter. Or fry, and serve with onions fried and put round 
them : sauce as above. 

The water in which they are boiled will make equally good 
jellies, either relishing or sweet, with that of calves' feet, if 
duly prepared ; and at a far less expense. This jelly gives 
great additional richness likewise to soups and gravies. 

To jDot Ox-feet or Cow-heel. — Boil them in fresh water till 
the bones can be easily removed ; cut them into small j)ieces. 
add a little of the liquor, just enough to moisten it, and mix 
with it a spoonful of vinegar, some pej)per and salt, and a little 
pounded mace ; put it into a mould and turn it out when cold. 
It is eaten with vinegar and mustard. 

MABR W-B ONES. 

97. — If too long to serve undivided, saw them in two ; 
cover the open ends with a lump of paste and a cloth floured 
and tied close ; the paste must be removed before sent to 
table. Boil 1 -2- or 2 hours according to the size ; put a ruffle 
of paper round each, and serve in a napkin, with very hot toast. 
The marrow is spread upon the toast, and seasoned with pepper 
and salt. 

B(EUF A-LA-3I0DE.—E. li. 

98. — The name of this dish is rather against it, suggesting 
ideas connected with London eating-houses ; but it would be 
very erroneous to suppose that the old family receipts now 
given, bear any resemblance to the degenerate successors of 
those cooks who formerly established a reputatian for thio 
iiiivoury compound. 



122 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. YIIL 

Cut out the bone from a rump of beef; then stuff the 
orifice witli rich forcemeat, made with veal and oysters, and 
the crumb of a roll steeped in milk. Half roast it, and before 
it is put into the stewpan insert in the top dried and pickled 
mushrooms, adding mushroom-powder in the orifices ; then 
put in 2 quarts of gravy, mu'le from the bones and trimmings, 
a large onion stuck with cloves, and 2 carrots cut in slices. 
When the beef has stewed till it is quite tender, strain and 
thicken the sauce ; add to it a glass of wine, mushrooms and 
03^sters, and sippets of fried paste ; either the mushrooms or 
oysters may be omitted, if the pure flavour should be more 
desirable : warm a few pickles vrith the garnish, and send it up 
very hotw 

Another. — Take a part of the rump of beef, or 2 of the 
ribs, boned and rolled, stick it Vv^ith some whole allspice, whole 
pepper and cloves, and cover it well with vinegar. Let it 
remain in pickle for 10 days, and then put the whole into a 
stewpan with 2 or 3 bay-leaves ; stew the beef for several 
liours until it is tender ; then strain the gravy, and add the 
jelly from 2 calves' feet or an ox-tail. This receipt will only 
suit persons who are fond of acid flavour : it is best eaten 
cold. 

TJie Bath Receipt. — ^Take 3 lbs. of the rump, or any part 
of the beef v\^hich will stew well ; trim it nicely, and cut off all 
the fat. Chop all sorts of sweet herbs together very finely, 
with a little shalot and a good deal of spice, i a teaspoonful 
of cayenne pepper, one of white pepj)er, a saltspoonful of 
allspice, half the quantity of pounded cloves, and a blade of 
mace wounded. Put these into a saucer that has been rubbed 
with garlic, and cover tliem with vinegar. Cut fat bacon into 
long slips, dip it into the herbs and vinegar, and let the herbs 
be very thick upon the bacon ; lard the beef regularly on 
both sides, if necessary, as it should be thoroughly flavoured. 
Rub the beef over with the remainder of the herbs and spice. 
Flour the meat, add a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, 
rolled in Hour, and a pint of water. Bake the beef in an 
oven, strain the gravy, which will scarcely require either 
thickening or browning, and serve it up w^ith pickles on 
the top. It is most excellent when cold, but should be 
served up hot at first. The gravy may be boiled to a glaze if 
necessary.

FILLETS OF BEEF. 
99. — Gut tlie inside of a sirloin or rump in slices ^ an indi 
thick ; trim them neatly ; melt a little butter in a saute or 
frying-pan ; season the fillets ; fry them lightly ; serve witli 
tomata-sauce, sorrel, anchovy butter, or gherkin-sauce. 

FILLET OF BEEF BRAISED. 
100. — Take the inside of a sirloin of beef, stuffed or plain, 
but rolled together so as to bring the fat into the centre. Put 
a small quantity of gravy into a stewpan, with a few slices of 
ham, and on this place the meat, covering it with chopped 
carrots, celery, button onions, and a pickled chili, together 
with a sliced gherkin, sweet herbs, salt, mace, and a little 
allspice, and let it simmer until tender : then brown it before 
the fire or with a salamander, skim and season the sauce, and 
send the meat, sauce, and vegetables up in the same dish. 

BEEFSTEAK A LA FRANC AISE 

y 

101. — Must be cut either from the sirloin or some other 
prime part of the beef, as r?^;??p-steaks are not known in France. 
Pour over it 2 large spoonfuls of the best Lucca oil, and let it 
remain all night : then put it and the oil into a frying-pan, 
with some finely-chopped parsley, pepper, and salt ; fry it 
until the gravy dries up and it becomes rather brown. Pour 
the contents of the pan over the steak as sauce. The steaks 
are usually garnished with slices of fried potatoes. As butter 
is not known in the southern states of Europe, oil is there con- 
stantly used in lieu of it, and this Parisian practice is borrowed 
from those countries. 

BEEF IN A MARINADE. 

102. — Cut the inside of a sirloin in slices, put them into a 
marinade made as follows : — Take equal quantities of vinegar 
and water, slice some carrots and onions, add some salt and a 
few pepper-corns with a clove of garlic. Let all stew together 
till the goodness be extracted from the vegetables, then strain 
it, and let it stand till cold. Let the meat lie in this pickle for 
24 hours before it is dressed ; then let it stew gently in a little 
good gravy till quite tender. Add a wineglassful of port wine, 
a tablespoonful of mushroom-ketchup, a teaspoonful of shalot- 
vinegar, and some butter rolled in flour : place the meat neatly 
in the dish, and pour the sauce over it.

BEEF A LA POLONAISE. 

103. — Take a few lbs. of the best beef, without bones, and, 
after having beaten it for some time with a rolling-pin, make 
in it deep incisions, but without cutting the meat through. 
Mince some onions, mix them with bread-crumbs, butter, pep- 
per, and salt ; fill the incisions with tliis forcemeat, and skewer 
up the meat. Put it with some butter into a stewpan, with a 
small quantity of water, and stew it upon a moderate fire. It 
should be served with brown sauce made from the gi*avy which 
is drawn from the meat. 

A la Houssard. — Take any piece of fresh beef, prepared as 
near as possible in the same manner as the Polonaise ; but 
instead of forcemeat, fill the incisions with pledgets of fat 
ham or bacon : season with pepper, salt, and onion ; lay it in 
an iron stewpan that has a cover to fit quite close, and set it 
by the side of tlie fire without water. Take care it does not 
burn, but it must have a strong heat ; in 2 or 3 hours it will 
be quite tender, and then serve with its own gravy. 

BEEF OLIVES.— E.R. 

104. — Cut some handsome steaks, flatten them with a roller, 
dredge them with a small quantity of white pepper and salt, 
have some forcemeat made with the fat and lean of veal 
mixed together, a small bit of lean ham or bacon, parsley, and 
sweet herbs, with a few bread-crumbs, all beaten in a mortar, 
and mixed with an egg ; lay a little over each steak, and roll 
it up tightly, fastening with a skewer ; dip them in the yolk 
of an egg, then in crumbs of bread, and fry tliem of a pale 
brown ; dish them with brown sauce, in which put a glass of 
white wine, with some strong gravy, seasoned with cayenne. 

A FRICANDEA U OF BEEF. 

105. — Take a piece of lean beef; lard it with bacon very 
closely ; put it into a stewpan with a pint of broth, a glass of 
white wine, a bundle of parsley, all sorts of sweet hei'bs, a 
clove of garlic, a shalot or two, 4 cloves, pepper and salt. 
When the meat is become tender, cover it close ; strain and 
skim the gi'avy ; set it on the fire, and let it boil till it is 
reduced to a glaze. Gilaze the larded side with this, and serve 
the meat on sorrel-sauce. 



Chap. Ylll. BEEF. 125 

BEEF RAGO UT.—E. R. 

106. — Fry 2 lbs. of the leg-of-mutton piece until quite 
brown. Put it into a stewpan with 6 large onions, pepper it 
well from a spicebox of mixed spice : boil water in tlie frying- 
pan, add it to the meat, and let it stew for 4 hours : serve it 
up with pickled v/alnuts, gherkins, and capers, just warmed in 
the gravy. 

FRICASSEE OF COLD ROAST BEEF. 

107. — Cut very thin slices of underdone beef; chop a hand- 
ful of parsley very small, put it with an onion into a stewpan, 
with a piece of butter and a spoonful of flour ; let it fry ; then 
add some strong broth ; season with salt and pepper; and sim- 
mer very gently \ of an hour ; then mix into it the yolk of 
2 eggs, a glass of port wine, and a spoonful of vinegar ; stir it 
quickly over the fire a minute or two ; put in the beef, make 
it hot, but do not let it boil ; rub the dish with shalot, and turn 
the fricassee into it. 

BEEF A LA VINAIGRETTE. 

108. — Cut a slice of underdone beef three inches thick, and 
a little fat ; stew it in k pint of water, a glass of white (not 
sweety wine, a bunch of sweet herbs, an onion, and a bay-leaf; 
season it with 8 cloves pounded and a little pepper ; let it stew 
till the liquor is nearly wasted awaj', turning it once. Strain 
oif the gravj'^, and mix it with a little vinegar for sauce. To 
be eaten cold. 

TO MINCE BEEF. 

109. — Mince the underdone part fine, with some of the fat ; 
put into a small stewpan a small quantity of onion or shalot, 
a little water, pepper, and salt ; boil it till the onion is quite 
soft ; then put in a little gravy and the mince. A few minutes 
will dress it, but do not let it boil. Have a small hot dish 
with sippets of bread ready, and pour the mince into it. If a 
little acidity is liked, a tablespoonful of shalot vinegar may be 
used instead of the raw shalot. 

Sanders. — Mince beef or mutton small, with onion, pepper, 
and salt ; add a little gravy, put it into scallop-shells or 
saucers, making them three parts full, and fill them up with 
potatoes mashed with a little cream ; put a bit of butter on the 
top, and brown them in an oven, or before the fire, or with a 
salamander

Cecils. — Mince any kind of meat, crumbs of bread, a good 
deal of onion, some anchovies, lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, 
chopped parsley, pepper, and a bit of butter Trarm, and mix 
them over the fire for a few minutes ; when cool enough, make 
it up into balls of the size and shape of a turkey's egg ; dip 
them in egg, and sprinkle v/ith fine crumbs, then fry them of 
a yellow brown ; and serve with gravy as before directed for 
Beef Olives. 

Minced Beef with Cucumbers. — Take a rump-steak un- 
dressed, and with a sharp knife shred it very fine. Put it 
into a stewpan v>^ith a little clarified butter and some salt ; stir 
it over a quick fire for a few minutes, then add ^ pint of good 
beef gravy ; let it boil gently till it becomes of a proper 
thickness. Cut 2 fine cucumbers in slices the thickness of a 
crown-piece, and put them with an onion sliced in a stewpan 
with some clarified butter, a little vinegar, and a lump of 
sugar ; fry them of a fine brown colour ; put them into a stew- 
pan with some plain gravy ; let it simmer gently till sufii- 
eiently done ; then laj^ the mince in the dish, and pour the 
cucumbers over it ; thicken the gravy with a little flour and 
butter : add the squeeze of a lemon just before serving. 

Or: — Take 1 lb. of juicy beef, i lb. of suet, and an onion ; 

remove every bit of skin or gristle from the meat, and mince 
it with the onion very finely ; add a little pepper and salt, flour 
the collops, melt a piece of butter in a stewpan, stir in the 
collops, adding a little gravy and a spoonful of ketchup or 
oyster-sauce : 10 minutes will be sufiicient to dress a pound. 

Or : — Take some lean beef, mince it very small, season it 
with pepper and salt, adding a very small quantity of vinegar ; 
press it do^vn in an earthen vessel : it v/ill keep some days. 
When wanted, take out the necessary quantity, put it into a 
stewpan, with a chopped onion, a spoonful of any sauce, some 
beef gravy, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Keep stir- 
ring it round until quite hot ; make an edge of chopped vege- 
tables or mashed potatoes, and put the beef in the middle, and 
then send it to table. This is the Scotch mode. 

BEEF COLLOPS.— E.R.

parsley, and shalot ; make a little gravy in the pan : send to 
table with gherkin or tomata sauce. 

Or : — Cut thin slices of beef from the rump, or any other 
tender part, and divide them mto pieces 3 inches long ; beat 
them with the blade of a knife, and flour them. Fry the col- 
lops in butter 2 minutes ; then lay them into a small stewpan, 
and cover them with a pint of gravy ; add a bit of butter 
rubbed in flour. 

BEEF PAL A TES. 

111. — Simmer the palates in water several hours, till they 
will peel ; then throw them into cold water, v/hich will make 
them thicken ; leave them v/hole or cut them into slices, and 
stev/ them in a rich gravy till quite tender. Before you serve, 
season them with cayenne, salt, and ketchup. If the gravy 
was drawn clear, give it a boil v/ith some butter and flour. 

If to be served white, boil the palates in milk, and stew 
them in fricassee- sauce ; adding cream, butter, flour, mush- 
room-powder, and a little pounded mace. 

To broil Palates. — Put a piece of butter rolled in flour 
into a stewpan, v/ith salt, pepper, 2 shalots, a clove, parsley, 
thyme, and a sprig of fennel, with as much milk or veal broth 
as will be necessary to simmer the palates until tender ; take 
them out, dip them in yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, and 
broil them slowly. Serve them with acid sauce. But if 
served up with any wliite sauce, they will be found very 
delicate when merely seasoned with a little mace and grating 
cf nutmeg. 

Boiled Palates. — ^Boil 6 palates very gently until they v/ill 
peel, then trim them ; cut the trinmiings into small shreds, 
and put them, with a little of the water in which they were 
boiled, a piece of butter rolled in flour, seasoning, and a glass 
of white wine, into a small stewpan, and let them stew gently 
till the gravy is very good. Brush the outside of the palates 
with yolk of e^^, lay a forcemeat well seasoned over, roll up 
the palates very tightly, and tie them with a string ; put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a cup of milk or 
cream, and let them braise gently for 2 hours. When read}^ 
lay the ragout of trimmings upon a dish, squeeze lemon-juice 
over it, lay the rolled palates on the top, and garnish v/ith 

'ckles, ejjir, and forcemeat-balls 



128 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Till. 

To fry Palates. — Parboil tliem, split them in two, spread 
upon them some good forcemeat made of pounded meat, and 
roll tlicm up like an olive ; then dip them in batter made of 
the yolks of eggs, flour, a spoonful of oil, and a glass of white 
wine, which must be added a very little at a tim.e : the batter 
should be a little thicker than very thick cream : fry them of 
a good colour. 

Or : — Cut the palates the size of a crown-piece ; after they 
have been boiled soak them for an hour in lemon-juice or 
vinegar-pickle ; dip them in the batter, and fry them. 

Or : — Skewer them at a little distance from each other 
after having dipped them in yolk of egg and bread-crumbs, 
and brown them before the fire in the small toasting machine 
for grillades. 

Palais de Boeuf, en Sauce blanche, — Clean and stew the 
palates till they can be skinned ; tlien, while hot, throw them 
into cold water for an hour : simmer them \evj slowly in the 
following sauce till quite tender. Put into a stewpan 4 oz, 
of lean veal, the same of lean bacon, 2 oz. of fat bacon, the 
same of butter, the thin rind of half a lenipn, and, the white 
peel being removed, the remainder sliced, 2 bay -leaves, 1 clove, 
1 onion, 1 carrot sliced thin, with as much water as will just 
^^over them ; keep the pan closely stopped, and simmer till the 
gravy be much reduced, stirring it often ; add some good 
broth, salt, and white pepper ; skim it, and dress the palates 
therein. 

Just before serving mix in the yolk of a new-laid egg over 
the fire, but the sauce must not boil. 

A la Mariette. — Boil 3 palates in water for an hour, peel 
them and cut them in two, lengthways ; put a slice of pickled 
pork between each, tie them together, put them into a stewpan 
with broth or milk and water, and a piece of butter rolled in 
flour, salt, whole pepper, a f^iggot of sweet herbs, and a clove-; 
stew them for some time, then skim and strain the gravy, 
thicken it, and serve them up very white. 

BEEF KIDNEY.— E. R. 

112. — After taking off the skin and fat, cut the kidney into 
slices, season and brown it in the frying-pan ; then put it into 
v\rater boiled in the pan, which must be floured, and let it stew 
gently for some time. It will be very rich and tender, but 



Chap. YIIL BEEF. 129 

cannot be considered a delicacy, and should be well peppered^ 
as well as eaten with mustard and garlic, or shalot vinegar. 

To mince a raio Beef Kidney. — Chop some parsley and a 
little shalot, mix it with the meat, seasoning it with pepper 
and salt, dredge a little flour over it, and put it into a stewpan 
with some butter ; let it stevv^ until tender, then add a tea- 
cupful of rich gravy and a glass of wine. Or, after it has 
heen dressed, with a small quantity of bacon or other fat, chop 
a little thyme with a bunch of parsley, pepper, and salt ; mix 
it all together, with a little thin melted butter ; lay it upon 
toast, strew bread-cnunbs over the top, and brown them in a 
Dutch oven. 

To make Rissoles of Kidney. — Cut the cold kidney into 
small dice, with a third part of bacon, and 1 or 2 hard-boiled 
eggs, according to the quantity, also cut into dice : season it 
well, bind it together with yolk of egg beaten up in a little 
melted butter, dip them in butter, or roll them in bread- 
crumbsj and fry them. 



CHAPTER IX. 
MUTTON. 

The most approved joints of mutton are the haunch and tlie 
saddle. The saddle is generally looked upon as preferable, 
thousrh the haunch is the most substantial. 

o 

HAUNCH OF MUTTON ROASTED. 

113. — It will require to be kept for some time, and mot 
therefore be well washed with vinegar, wiped every da}', and, 
if necessary, rubbed with pounded pepper and ginger. Stick 
some cloves in the knuckle, and, 24 hours before it is put upon 
the spit, having thoroughly dried and wiped it clean, lay it in 
a pan, and pour as much port wine over it as will serve to 
soak it, turning it frequently, so that every part shall equally 
imbibe the wine. 

Gut off the knuckle rather close to the joint of the leg ; nick 
the cramp-bone, and that \\\\\ allow the cushion or thick part 
of the leg to dra^r up and be more plump ; trim off the thick 
skin at the flank and round off the corner of the fat, so as to 



130 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. IX. 



make the joint appear neat. Cover the fat with oiled paper, 
which should be taken off i hour before you think it will be 
done ; then dredge the meat very lightly with flour, and sprinkle 
it freely with salt ; serve it up with currant jelly, and a sauce 
of port wine, spice, and gravy ; a piece of fringed paper being 
tied neatly round the shank-bone. To roast a haunch of 14 
or 16 lbs. will take from 3 to 3^ hours; or even a little more 
if the vv-eather be very cold, or if required to be '' very well 
done.'^ 

To make it taste like Venison. — Let the haunch hang nearly 
the usual time ; then take the skin carefully off, and rub the 
meat Avith olive-oil, then put it into a pan with a quantity of 
whole pepper, 4 cloves of garlic, a bundle of sweet herbs, 
consisting of parsley, thyme, sweet marjoram, and 2 bay- 
leaves. Pour upon the meat a pint of vinegar and 3 or 4 
tablespoonfuls of olive-oil. Cover the upper surface of the 
meat with slices of raw onion, and turn it every day, 'always 
taking care to put the slices of onion on the top surface. At 
the expiration of 4 days, take the meat out, wipe it with a 
napkin, and hang it up in a cool place till the next day, when 
it is fit for roasting. 

A more simple method is to let it hang until it is tender, 
wiping it every day. A clove or two of garlic, if put into the 
knuckle when the haunch is hung up, will give it a much 
higher flavour. 

SADDLE OF 3IUTT0N E.R. 

1 14. — Is formed of the 2 loins, and is also called " the chine." 
This joint should be tender, but requires to hang only 2 or 3 
days. Rub the part close round the tail with salt, after first 
cutting out the kernel. Wipe it, as well as all other meats, 
daily, but do not take them into a warm kitchen to do it. 
Take out the fat from the inside, and also the kidneys : some 
cooks split the tail, and ske^^er the pieces back in a ring on 
either side. It should be roasted in a cradle-spit : when nearly 
done, sprinkle the mutton with salt, dredge it with flour, and 
-:end it up finely frothed. Stewed lentils or haricot beans are 
frequently served round this joint. 

If the saddle or haunch be sponged a few times with port 
wine, and then hung up in the air to dry, it will be found a 
f^reat improvement. 

The saddle will take 2 or 2^ hours, according to the size 



CuAr. IX. MUTTON. 131 

SADDLE OF 3IUTT0N A LA PORTUGAISE. 
115. — Take 2 quarts of port-wine bottoms or lees, a pint of 
vineffan and a pint of stock ; shred 6 or 8 shalots, 3 onions, 
2 carrots, and 6 turnips, a spoonful of allspice, a dozen cloves, 
and as many bay-leaves. IMake this boiling hot, and pour it 
over a saddle of mutton, having- first cut off the tail close, 
trimmed off" the superfluous fat from the top, and also the flaps. 
Turn it every morning and evening for 4 or 5 days. Spit it 
and cover it with a buttered paper, and roast for 2 or 3 hours, 
according to its size. It will require longer than usual to 
roast, and will be quite black, but the flavour will be delicious. 
When nearly done, remove the paper. Strain and boil a little 
of the liquor for sauce, adding some gravy and currant jelly 

to it. 

SHOULDER OF 3IUTT0N—E.B. 

116. — May be dressed in various ways, but the most usual 
is to roast it nicely, and send it up with onion sauce. 

It is an unsightly joint ; but the appearance may be im- 
proved by cutting off' the knuckle, ^^ hen it may be called a 
shield ; it has more diflerent sorts of meat in the various cuts 
than the leg. 

The bone may also be taken out, and the mutton stuffed ; it 
is very good baked, and is frequently served upon a Yorkshire 
pudding. 

Salted and boiled. — Bone it ; if large, take 4 oz. of common 
salt, the same quantity of coarse sugar, mixed with a dessert- 
spoonful of pounded cloves, half that quantity of pepper, a 
little pounded mace and ginger ; rub them well into the 
mutton, turning it every day for a week ; then roll it up tight, 
and boil it gently for 3 or 4 hours in a quart of water, with a 
carrot, turnip, onion, and a bunch of sweet herbs. Serve it 
with some of its own gravy, tliickened and highly flavoured, or 
witli any piquant sauce ; or smothered with onions. Members 
of the Yacht Club, or captains of ships, are recommended, 
when they have fresh mutton, to tow it overboard for some 
hours, and then lay it up in the shrouds. It will then be 
coated with briny particles, which Avill effectually keep in all 
the juices. 

ROLLED 3IUTT0N. 

117. — Bone a shoulder of mutton, taking care not to cut the 
upper skin ; take out all the m^at and mince it small, add 



132 MODERIS^ DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. IX 

black pepper, salt, parsley, lemon-thyme, green onions, finely 
cliopi^ed lemon-peel, and a little nutmeg ; mix these well 
together, with. 1 egg \Yell beaten : put all back into the skin 
and roll it up tight. Bake it 2-k hours. Make a gravy of the 
bones and trimmings, season it v.ith pepper and salt, 1 onion, 
1 spoonful of soy, 1 of shalot vinegar, and a glass of port wine. 
Pour the gravy over the meat, and garnish with forcemeat- 
balls. 

BREAST OF 3IUTT0N. 

1 18. — The brisket changes first in the breast : and if it is to 
be kept, it is best to rub it with a little salt, should the weather 
be hot. 

Cut off the superfluous fat, joint it well, and roast, and serve 
it with stev/ed cucumbers ; or to eat cold, sprinkle it well with 
chopped parsley while roasting. 

Or :-^Bone it, take off a good deal of the fat, and cover it 
■■,^ith crumbs of bread, herbs, and seasoning; then roll and boil 
till tender : serve with tomata-sauce or sorrel. 

Or : — Stew it with all the usual kinds of vegetables and a 
little curry powder. 

Or : — Cut off the fe.t, and half boil it ; take out the bones, 
and beat the breast fiat; season it vvith pepper and salt ; brush 
it over with the yolk of an egg, and strev/ over it minced 
parsley and green onions, mixed with crumbs of bread ; baste 
it well with fresh butter, and broil it in a Dutch oven. Serve 
with stewed cucumber or sauce Robert. 

LEG OF MUTTON BOASTED.— E. B. 

119. — A leg of mutton intended for roasting should be kept 
longer than for boiling ; it should be carefully attended to 
during the time it is hung up, constantly wiped to prevent any 
mustiness gathering on the top and below the flap, and in liot 
weather lightly dusted with flour or pepper to keep off* the flies. 
The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg should be 
taken out by the butcher, for it taints first there ; and tlie 
bloody part of the neck should also be cut oif when first 
brought in. 

Remove ike thick skin very carefully ; trim oif tlie piece of 
flank that adheres to the fat, and flatten the fat with a cutlet- 
beater or chopper ; cut off the knuckle, and nick the cramp- 
bone, to allow it to become more plump, as in the haunch. 
Put :i little salt and water into the dripping-pan to baste the 



Chap, IX. MUTTOX. 133 

meat at first ; but then use only its own gravy. Serve with 
jelly. If the weather should be cold, hang the mutton for S 
weeks. Should the weather not admit of its hanging so long, 
put it into a pan, and cover it vrith coarse brown sugar, turn- 
ing it every day ; and when to be roasted, remove the skin, 
and wrap it up in oiled paper. This process will cause it to 
be very tender and juicy. 

A leg of mutton is usually roasted whole, but can be divided 
advantageousl}' for a small family. Cut the knuckle into a 
good-sized joint, and boil it until tender ; but put a coarse 
paste over the lower part of the thick end to keep in the gravy, 
and roast it : or if the skin be raised gently from the outside of 
the leg, to about 6 or 7 inches wide, 2 or 3 good slices may 
be cut off for steaks, and the skin then fastened down with 
skewers. 

LEG OF MUTTON BOILED. 

120. — To prepare a leg of mutton for boiling, trim it as for 
roasting ; soak it for a couple of hours in cold water ; then put 
onh* water enough to cover it, and let it boil gently for 3 
hours, or according to its v.eight. Some cooks boil it in a 
cloth; but if the water be afterwards wanted for soup, that 
should not be done ; some salt and an onion put into the water 
is far better. "^Ylien nearly ready, take it from the fire, and, 
keeping the pot well covered, let it remain in the water for 
10 or 15 minutes. 

The Enf>lish taste being;' in favour of meat in which the 
gravy has been retained, this joint is esteemed to be in perfec- 
tion when a little underdone. It is sent to table with caper- 
sauce and mashed turnips. 

To stuff a Leg of Mutton. — Take a "le^ of mutton, cut oft 
all the fat, take the bone carefully out and preserve the skin 
whole; take out the meat and mince it fine; mince with it 
about 1 lb. of fat bacon and some parsley; season the v/hole well 
with pepper and salt, and a small quantity of shalot or chives 
chopped fine ; then put tlie meat into the skin and sew it up 
on the under side : put it into a stewpan nith a little gravy 
made from the bones, 2 o-r 3 slices of veal, some sliced carrots 
and onions, a bunch of parsley, and a fev/ slices of fat bacon ; 
let it stew for 3 or 4 hours, and drain the liquor through a 
fine sieve; when reduced to a glaze, glaze the mutton v.'ith it 
Olid serve in stewed French beans. 



134 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. IX, 

To dress a Leg of Mutton with Oysters. — Parboil some 
well-fed oysters, take off the beards and horny parts ; put to 
them some parsley, mmced onion, and sweet herbs, boiled and 
chopped fine, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard-boiled eggs. Mix 
all together, and cut 5 or 6 holes in the fleshy part of a leg of 
mutton, and put in the mixture : and dress it in either of the 
following ways ; — Tie it up in a cloth and let it boil gently 2^ 
or 3 hours, according to the size. 

Or: — Braise it, and serve with a pungent brown sauce. 

NECK OF MUTTON 

121. — Is particularly useful, as many dishes may be made 
of it. The best end of the neck may be boiled for H hour, 
and served with turnips; or roasted; dressed in steaks; in 
fies ; a la Turc ; or en haricot. 

The scrag may be stewed, with a small quantity of water, 
some small onions, a few peppercorns, and a little rice, and 
served together. 

"When a neck is to be boiled, to look particularly nice, saw 
down the chine-bone, strip the ribs halfway down, take out 
the end bones, and turn the flap under. The skin should not 
be taken off till boiled, and then the fat will remain white. 
The neck is very commonly divided, the " scrag " being boiled 
for broth, and the remaining part either roasted or cut into 
chops : the scrag will require rather more stewing than the 
other part to make it tender. If slightly salted for 2 or 3 
days, the fat will be so much improved as to become firm, and 
appear clarified. 

Or : — Boil the neck very gently until it is nearly done 
enough ; then, \ an hour or 20 minutes before serving, cover 
it thickly with bread-crumbs and sweet herbs chopped, with a 
little drawn butter or the yolk of an ^^<^^ and put it into a 
Dutch oven before the fire. By this process the meat will 
taste much better than if merely roasted or boiled. This is a 
very good way of dressing the neck and breast of mutton, 
as the liquor tbey have been boiled in will make very good 
pea-soup. 

LOIN OF MUTTON ROASTED. 

122. — Take off the skin and some of the fat ; joint it, and 
skewer it from the flap into the fillet ; then put the spit through 
the chump, and the skewer at the thin end will secure the 
joint in its place ; roast for 1 ^ hour. 



Chap. IX. MUTTON. 135 

For a small family the loin should be divided, and the 
chump end, if boiled, will make fine broth ; and the ribs may 
be either plainly roasted, or dressed as above. The flesh is 
richer than that of the neck, and many prefer the latter as 
being more delicate ; chops, or Coteleis de 3Iouton, are in 
Paris always taken from the neck. 

To stew a Loin of Mutton. — Bone a loin of well-hung 
mutton ; take off the skin, and remove the fat from the inside ; 
put it into a stewpan, with broth enough to cover it, and let 
it stew gently till it becomes of a good brown colour ; add a 
glass of port wine, a large spoonful of mushroom ketchup, and 
some vegetables cut in shapes, or stewed haricot beans. 

MUTTON-CHOPS 
123. — Should be taken from the loin, from -^ to f of an inch 
tliick. They should not be put on the gridiron until every- 
thing else is ready to be served ; have a clear cinder fire to 
broil them : if the fat falling from them should cause a blaze, 
remove the gridiron for a moment, and strew a handful of salt 
over the fire. They should be kept continually turned ; the 
greater part of the chine-bones should be chopped off; cut off 
a good deal of the fat, but do not pepper or flour the chops ; 
and serve them one at a time, immediately they are done. 

HABICOT OF 3IUTT0N.—E.R. 

124. — Cut a neck or loin of mjiiton into thin chops ; flour 
and fry them bro^vn in a small quantity of butter ; drain them 
on a sieve, then put them into a stewpan, and cover them >vith 
gravy ; add 1 carrot, 2 leeks, a faggot of parsley and thyme, 
2 or 3 blades of mace, some allspice, 1 onion, and 2 turnips ; 
stew them until the meat is tender ; then take out the chops, 
strain the gravy, and sivim off all the fat ; put a little butter 
mixed with flour into the stewpan, stir it until melted and 
made quite smooth, adding the gravy by degrees, stirring all 
the time ; then put in the chops, with some carrots and turnips 
ready blanched and cut into pretty shapes, with a dozen silver 
onions whole, and also half-boiled ; season slightly with pep- 
per and salt, a very little soy, and a teaspoonful of Tarragon 
vinegar ; stew the whole gently for \ of an hour, and serve 
quite hot. 

Another. — Cut from the neck 8 or 10 cutlets, leaving- the 
bones short, and taking off some of the fat : fry them in 2 oz. 



136 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Ch."^. iX. 

of butter till of a light brown ; add a tablespoonful of flour, 
mix it well, and put in a quart of water ; cut 2 dozen little 
balls of turnip with a round scoop, and as many pieces of ca r- 
rot and the same number of small onions, with a little parsley 
and a couple of bay-leaves. Put J oz. of pounded sugar into 
a stewpan ; when melted, add 2 oz. of butter and the vegeta- 
bles, which keep tossing over the firo till covered with a kind 
of glaze ; put them into the stewpan with the cutlets, let them 
simmer till the vegetables are done, skim well, place the cut- 
lets in a crown on the dish, put the vegetables in the centre, 
and pour the gravy over them. 

A SCOTCH HA G GIS.—E. R. 

125. — Take the stomach of a sheep ; wash it with cold water 
until perfectly clean ; then turn it inside out, scald it, scrape 
it with a knife quickly, and then put it into cold salt and water 
till M^anted. Take the liver, liglits, and heart, and parboil 
them ; grate the liver, and mince the other parts quite fine ; 
mince also ^ lb. of suet, 3 or 4 onions, toast ^ lb. of round 
oatmeal-cakes before the fire, and pound them into powder, 
wliich is to be thickly sprinkled over the mince ; mix all well 
together ; season with pepper and salt ; then fill the bag, and 
before sewing it up put in a large teacupful of any kind of 
strong broth or gravy. Put tlie bag, neatly sewed up, in a 
pan with enough of boiling water to cover it, and a small plate 
under it ; prick it over with a needle to prevent its bursting, 
and let it boil 4 or 5 hours, keeping it constantly covered with 
boiling water. 

The English mode is — To mince the heart, the tongue, the 
kidneys, and a part of the liver of the sheep, with a third of 
its weight in fat bacon, 2 anchovies chopped small, and the 
crumb of a penny roll grated, a saltspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, pepper, salt, 2 eggs beaten, and a glass of Mine ; mix all 
well together ; butter a mould, put in the mixture, and let it 
boil for 2 hours : or it may be boiled in a veal caul. 

TO STEW MUTTON. 
1 26. — Cut some slices rather thick out of any part of mutton ; 
put them into a stewpan with some pepper and salt, an onion 
or two, a sliced carrot, and a little shalot ; cover the steaks 
with broth, and let them stew from 20 minutes to ^ an hour, 
but not longer, or they will become hard ; cover the stewpaL 



CiiAP. IX. MUTTOX. 137 

close, and when the steaks are about half-done turn them. 
Before serving, add a little butter rolled in flour, and a spoon- 
ful or two of mushroom-ketchup. 

AN IRISH STEW. 

127. — Cut 6 rather thick chops from the loin; when the 
square ends of the bones are cut off, these will probably weigh 

2 lbs. ; lay them in an iron pot, and put 4 lbs. of sliced pota- 
toes, placed in layers, with the chops, and half a dozen small 
onions, with about a quart of water ; cover the pan closely, 
and let them stew on a moderate fire for 2 hours, or until the 
potatoes have become nearly a mash, and absorbed all the 
A'.ater and gravy of the meat ; the chops will then be found 
very tender, and the potatoes rich with the fat. The stew 
siiould be eaten hot, but without any kind of sauce. 

TO HASH MUTTON. 

128. — Cut very thin slices from any joint of mutton that has 
been row^ted. Fry some onions in a little butter ; add 2 large 
spoonfuls of good gravy, and let them stew for about 10 
minutes ; then put in the meat, with a spoonful of walnut- 
ketchup, a little browning, and lemon-pickle. Let it boil for 

3 or 4 minutes ; season it with salt and cayenne pepper, and 
serve it quite hot, without thickening the gravy. Garnish 
with red cabbage. 

If the meat has been boiled, cut the slices rather thick, and 
use broth sufficient to make rather more gravy than for the 
roast ; take mushroom instead of walnut ketchup ; season with 
salt, white pepper, mace, and chopped parsley ; add a few 
capers or a minced gherkin, and serve with sijDpets of bread 
fried in butter. 

A little wine may be employed so as only to' impart a slight 
flavour : port for the roast, and white wine for the boiled. 

LEG OF MUTTON BRAISED.— E. R. 

129. — Take a very small leg of mutton, cut off the knuckle, 
and trim it nicely ; half roast it ; then put it into a stewpan 
with the trimmings, the knuckle-bone broken, a few slices of 
fat bacon or 2 oz. of butter, an onion stuck with cloves, and a 
bundle of sweet herbs. Shake the stewpan over the fire until 
there is gravy enough from the meat and the trimmings to 
ste^v tlie nmtton, and take care to turn it in the braise. Wheii 



13S MODEPtX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Cijip. IX. 

very tender, take it up, remove the fat from the gravy, strain 
it, and boil it quickly until it is reduced to a glaze : pour it 
over the mutton, and serve it up on a puree of vegetables. 

MUTTON KEBOBBED. 

130. — Cut a loin of mutton into steaks; take off the fat 
and skin ; mix a small nutmeg gra,ted with a little salt and 
pepper, crumbs, and herbs ; dip the steaks into the yolks of 3 
eggs, and sprinkle the above mixture all over them ; then 
place the steaks togetlier as they were before they -svere cut 
asunder, tie them, and fasten them on a small spit % roast 
them at a quick iire ; set a dish under, and baste them with a 
good piece of butter and the liquor that comes from the meat, 
but throw some more of the seasoning over. When done 
enough, take it up, and lay it in a dish ; have \ pint of good 
gravy ready besides that in the dish, and put into it 2 spoonfuls 
of ketchup, and rub down a teaspoonful of flour with it ; give 
this a boil, and pour it over the mutton, but first skim off the 
fat. Mind to keep the meat hot, till the gravy is quite ready. 

J?,'A HOCHEPOT. 

131. — Cut a neck or loin of mutton into chops, pmd pa.e off 
the fat ; put them into a jar with a lettuce cut into quarters, 
2 or 3 turnips and carrots, 2 cucumbers quartered, 4 or 5 
onions, and pepper and salt ; cover the jar closely, and plunge 
it into a kettle of boiling water ; let it boil 4 hours, keep the 
kettle full, but take care that the water does not come over 
the top of the jar. Serve v\4th green peas or any other vege- 
tables in the dish. 

31 UTTON A U D'ALMO YSE. 

132. — Takel lb. of the tender part of a loin of mutton, 
chop the lean and the fat together very small. Boil 2 oz. of 
rice very tender, mix it v.ith the meat while warm, then 
season the whole with the juice of half an onion, a small 
quantity of pepper and salt, and the yolk and white of an 
e.^'g ; make the mixture into balls. Take sufficient quantity 
of vine-leaves, boil them till they are quite tender, and wrap 
up the balls in them. Put the balls into a small quantity of 
mutton-broth, stew them 1^ hour over a slow fire, then take 
them out of the stev/pan, and thicken the gravy v/ith the yolk 
of an e^^ arid a little cream ; sf^ason with pepper and salt, 



Chap. IX. MUTTON. 139 

squeeze the juice of a lemon over the balls, and serve them up 
with the sauce over them, Y/liich will be white. 

Mutton Pilau. — Take ^ lb. of the neck of mutton ; boil it 
well ; boil 2 cups of rice, the same as for ciifry. Cut the 
boiled mutton into small pieces, and fry it in butter ; then 
add it and the rice with the butter, a few cloves, a little cin- 
namon, and some cardamoms ; let the whole simmer for ^ an 
hour. In dishing it, put a little rice at the bottom of the 
dish, the meat in the centre ; cover it over with the remaindei 
of the rice, and scatter the spice on the top. 

A CA3IP DISH. 

133. — Take any joint of mutton, put it into a pot with a 
good many onions cut small, and as many vegetables as can 
be obtained to add to it ; 2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 5 of 
port wine ; season it with black and red pepper ; add a spoon- 
ful of flour, and, if at hand, 4 dessertspoonfuls of Harvey's 
sauce and essence of anchovies. Cover the meat with water, 
and let it stew 1-^ hour ; it should be stirred frequently to pre- 
vent it from burning, as there should be only water sufficient 
to cook it. Should there be a steam-apparatus, do not add the 
water. This is an excellent dish in camp, and it also suits a 
family where there are many persons to be fed from one joint. 
A fowl may be added to or substituted for the mutton. 

CHINA CHILOE. 

134. — Mince a pint basin of undressed neck of mutton, or 
leg, and some of the fat ; add 2 onions, 1 lettuce, 1 pint of 
green peas, 1 teaspoonful of salt, 1 teaspoonful of pepper, 4 
tablespoonfuls of water, and 2 or 3 oz. of clarified butter ; 
closely cover the stewpan ; smimer 2 hours, and serve in the 
middle of a dish of boiled dry rice. If cayenne is approved, 
add a little. This cannot be done too slowly. 

3IINCED 3IUTT0N.—E.R. 

135. — Mince dressed meat very finely, season it, m.ake a 
very good gravy, warm the meat up in it, and serve with fried 
bread round the dish, or with poached eggs. 

Or ;— ^Mince cold leg of mutton freed from the skin and 
fat, warm it with stewed cucumbers, taking care that it does 
not burn after the meat is put in. 

A}f Gratin, or as ScaUops. — Mince dressed mutton with a 



140 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. IX. 

very little fat, season lightly with pej^per and salt, and pu» 
into scallop-shells about half full. Then put potatoes mashed 
with a little milk, and a very small bit of butter ; smooth with 
a spoon, and^rown in a Dutch oven. 

As liissoles. — Enclose the minced meat in a paste or brown- 
ing of egg and crumbs of bread, but season it as if for force- 
meat. 

MUTTON CUTLETS.— E.R. 

136. — Cut the best end of a neck of mutton into cutlets ^ 
an inch thick, and chop each bone short ; flatten and trim 
them, scraping the end of the bone quite clean ; brush them 
with egg, and cover them with crumbs, herbs, and seasoning ; 
and serve them either with tomata or any other piquant sauce. 

Hindostanee fashion. — Cut the chops from the neck, pare 
away all the fat, and scrape the bone ; then have some very 
fine mashed potatoes ; wrap the cutlets in it ; brush them over 
with yolk of egg.^ and fry them. They may also be fried in 
the same manner, dipped in batter. 

With Potato Puree. — The cutlets should be dipped in cla- 
rified butter, then in crumbs, afterwards in yolk of egg, and 
again in crumbs ; flatten them with a knife, and fry in hot fat 
as you would fish. The potatoes are to be boiled, rubbed 
through a hair-sieve, and worked up fine and light with a little 
butter and boiling cream ; season v>ith pepper, salt, and an 
atom of nutmeg ; dish the cutlets round this puree, which 
must be softer than mashed potatoes. This is an excellent 
dish for luncheon. 




Mutton Cutlets. 



Cotelettes de Moidon en Ragout. — Take off all the fat from 
tlie cutlets, dredge the meat with flour, and put^them into a 
stewpan with the fat melted, a bundle of sweet herbs, and 2 
shalots minced ; let them brown, then strain the gravy, add 



Chap. IX. MUTTON. HI 



a glass of wine, and 1 of Reading sauce ; thicken, if necessary, 
with a little roux, and let the whole stew until very tender. 

Cotelettes de Mouton a la Polonaise. — Remove all the fat, 
put the meat into a covered stewpan, with a carrot and a 
turnip sliced, 2 onions, a bundle of sweet herbs, a little pepper 
and salt, and enough broth to moisten the whole ; let it stew 
very gently until the meat is perfectly done, then take it out. 
strain the gravy, put it over a brisk fire, and reduce it to a 
glaze ; then cover the cutlets with the glaze, and serve them 
up with tomata-sauce, or a vegetable puree of any kind. 

Cotelettes a la Maintenon. — Cut and trim cutlets from a 
neck or loin of mutton ; chop very finely a quantity of parsley, 
a little thyme, and a shalot ; fry the chops a little with the 
herbs ; then allow them to cool ; add some fresh parsley 
chopped and a few crumbs of bread, and seasoning ; spread 
this over the cutlets with a knife, wrap them in buttered paper, 
and broil them over a slow fire. Serve a sauce piquant in a 
boat. 

Or : — Cut them handsomely from the loin or back end of 
the neck ; half fry them, and then cover them Avith herbs, 
crumbs of bread, and seasoning ; lay this on very thickly and put 
them into a stewpan with a little gravy ; stew until tender, then 
wrap them in writing-paper, and finish them on the gridiron. 

Cotelettes aiix Haricots verts. — Having dressed French 
beans as usual, drain the water from them, and simmer them 
with pepper and salt in a good piece of butter. A few minutes 
before serving add the beaten yolk of an e^^^, and shake the 
pan over the fire ; but they must not boil. In the mean time 
have ready 3 mutton-cutlets, neatly trimmed, seasoned with 
pepper, salt, ana a few crumbs, and nicely fried ; and serve 
them on the French beans. 

Scrags of Mutton a la Sainte Mmehould. — Order the nar- 
row part of a neck of small mutton to be cut oflP before the 
sheep be divided ; which leaves the two scrags united. Soak 
in warm water, then hang it 2 days ; lay it in a stewpot, with 
slices of fat bacon over and under, 2 lbs. of scrag of veal, 3 
large carrots, 3 onions, a large bunch of sweet herbs, 2 bay- 
leaves, and a tabJespoonful of white peppercorns ; cover the 
\A hole with beef-broth, and simmer 4 hours. Drain the gravy 
f; om the meat, which cover on all sides with crumbs of bread 
uiixed with pepper and salt, an(i brown it with a salamander 



J42 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. IX. 

Strain and boil the gravy quickly. Serve with endive, tomata- 
saucCj or stewed spinach in the dish. 

M U TTON KIDNE YS.—E. R. 

137. — Split, pepper, and broil the cut side first, which will 
make a cup for the gravy when the outer part is turned to the 
fire. Chop some parsley very fine, mix it well with a little 
fresh butter, the juice of a lemon, pepper and salt, and put a 
little on each. A sheep's heart may be split open, and broiled 
in the same way. 

With a very sharp knife cut mutton kidneys in the thinnest 
possible slices ; flour, and fry quickly till they are quite crisp. 
^Yhile frying, add pepper and salt. Serve them in a good 
gravy, to which a bit of garlic has given a very slight flavour. 

Hognons, au Vm de Champagne. — Slice or mince them, 
and fry them with a little chopped parsley and shalot until 
they become of a light brown, seasoning them with pepper and 
salt ; then dust them with flour, moisten them with a little 
strong gravy and a glass of Champagne, and let them stew for 
an instant. 

SHEEP'S TAILS AND KIDNEYS.— E.R. 

138. — Cut the tails, boil them for 15 minutes, then put 
them into a stewpan with h pint of gravy, an onion stuck with 
cloves, a little salt, and cayenne pepper. Stew till tender, 
strain the gravy, thicken it with flour and butter, and add the 
juice of '-2 a lemon. Boil until the Avhole is very smooth, broil 
half a dozen kidneys, and place them in the middle of a dish 
with the tails and sauce round. 

These are the most tasty modes, but kidneys, when meant 
for breakfast, are usually broiled upon the gridiron, without 
parsley or lemon ; being only split open, well peppered, and a 
bit of butter put upon them when done. They must be sent 
to table the instant they are done, for if not quite hot they are 
not worth eating. 

MUTTON RU3IPS AND KIDNEYS. 

139. — Stew 6 rumps in some good mutton-gravy h an hour ; 
tiien take them up, and let them stand to cool. Clear the 
gravy from the fat ; and put into it 4 oz. of boiled rice, an 
onion stuck with cloves, and a blade of mace ; boil them till 
the rice is thick. Wash the rumps with yolks of eggs well 
beaten ; and strew over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper 



Chap. IX. MUTTON".- 143 

and salt, chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel. 
Fry m butter of a fine brown, pour out the fat, and warm the 
rice in the pan. While the rumps are stewing lard the kid- 
neys, and put them to roast in a Dutch oven. Lay the rice on 
the dish ; the rumps put round, the narrow ends towards the 
middle, and the kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut 
in half, the white being left on ; or with different coloured 
pickles. 

SHEEP'S HEADS, HEARTS, TAILS, AND TONGUES.~E. R^ 

140. — A great variety of excellent dishes may be made 
from a sheep^s head, which in India, where veal is not so easih/ 
procurable, answers all the purposes for mock turtle, rolled 
head, rich hash, or ragout : the bones make excellent jelly, 
either savoury or sweet. Parboil the head ; cut the meat from 
the bone ; stew the former in a little of the liquor until quite 
tender ; send it to table with a glass of wine in the gravy, 
forcemeat-balls and brain-cakes for garnish ; or roll up the 
pieces seasoned in the inside with a thick covering of chopped 
herbs well seasoned ; brush the outside with yolk of e^^ ; 
dredge it with bread-crumbs ; fry it ; and send to table with a 
rich gravy made of the bones, and pickles warmed up in it. 

Take a sheep's heart and stuff it throughout, using a consi- 
derable quantity of chopped bacon in the stuffing; half boil 
it, and when cooled a little rub it over with pepper and salt, 
and wTap it in paste in the shape of a cone. Eub the paste 
over with the yoke of an e.^^, and strew vermicelli loosely 
over it. Set it with the broad end downwards and bake it in 
the oven. When baked, send it to table with gravy sauce. 

Sheep's Tails and Tongues. — Take 3 tails and 3 tongues, 
cut the tails in half and split the tongues. Stew them gently 
for 3 hours in as much water as will cover them, adding 3 
spoonfuls of vinegar, 3 onions, a teaspoonful of mixed spice, 
and 1 of salt : these ingredients to be put in after the pot has 
been skimmed. When the tails, &c., are very tender, take 
them out, score them, dip them in drawn butter, roll them in 
grated bread-crumbs, and let them lie for a few minutes, then 
put on more butter with a knife, and additional bread-crumbs, 
which latter should be slightly seasoned ; brown them before 
the fire. • Strain the gravy, squeeze lemon-juice over the 
tongues and taik, and serve them in the grav\ 



144 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKErtY. Chap. X. 

SHEEP'S TROTTERS.— E.R. 

141. — Boil the trotters, or ratijer stew them gently, for 
several hours, until the bones will come out. The liquor they 
are boiled in will make excellent stock or jelly. Take out tlie 
bones without injury to the skin, stuff them with a fine force- 
meat ; stew them for h an hour in some of the stock, w^hich 
must be well flavoured with onion, seasoning, and a little 
sauce ; take out the trotters, strain the sauce, reduce it to a 
g-laze, and brush it over the feet. Serve with any stewed 
vegetable. 

Or : — Prepare them in the same way, and dip them in a 
batter and fry them. The paste, or batter, for frying, is best 
made thus : mix 4 spoonfuls of flour with 1 of olive-oil, and a 
sufficient quantity of beer to make it of the proper thickness ; 
then add the whites of 2 eggs well beaten and a little salt. 
Serve with tomata-sauce. 

Or : — Simply boil them, and eat them cold with oil and 
vineffar. 



CHAPTER X. 

LAMB. 

Lamb is of two qualities — '■ liouse-lamb " and " grass-lamb ;" 
the former coming into season, as a great delicacy, just before 
Christmas, and the latter not until Easter. Both are, however 
dressed in the same manner — chiefly plain, boiled and roasted, 
only that house-lamb, being the greater nicety, is more fre- 
quently boiled, more particularly tlie leg, and accompanied 
with white sauce. Though fat, yet, if well chosen, the leg will 
not weigh more than about 3 or 3i lbs. 

BOILED LEG OF LAMB 

142. — Should look as white as possible. Choose a ewe leg, 
as there is more fat on it ; saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap 
and the thick skin on the back of it, soak it in warm water for 
o hours, then boil it gently (time according to size) ; pour a 
little white sauce over it. The loin may be fried in steaks and 
swerved round, garnished with dried or fried parsley : spinach or 
sea-kale to be eaten with it. 

Or it may be servnd with parsley and butter, or with oyster- 



CHAr. X. ♦ LAMB. 145 

sauce. It will not take more than about ] hour, if the joint 
be taken from the house-lamb ; but grass-lamb will require i 
ill! hour longer. 

QUARTERS OF LA3IB ROASTED. 

143. — Fore Quarter. — Cut off the scrag 1 joint from the 
shoulder ; saw off the chine-bone, and also the bone of the 
breast, and joint it thoroughly ; crack the ribs in the middle ; 
cut off the thick skin which covers the lower part of the breast, 
and break the bone of the shoulder to allow of the knuckle 
twisting round, and secure it in its place with a skewer from 
beneath the breast right up the knuckle. Put 2 large skewers 
at the thin end ; pass the spit between the skewers and the ribs, 
through the thick part at the shoulder ; paper it, having a 
double thickness over the thin end. When the quarter is 
roasted whole, the shoulder should be raised either at table or 
when dished. 

The hind quarter is sometimes roasted, and served witli 
mint-sauce. It may also be larded, covered with oiled paper, 
and when more than half done the paper to be withdrawn, the 
meat basted with oil or yolk of Qgg, and sliglitly covered with 
crumbs of bread ; then put closer to the tire to give it a line 
brov/n ; when served, it is sprinkled with the juice of a lemon. 

The quarter, of 8 to 10 lbs. weight, will take 2i to 2i hours 
in dressing, as it ought to be always well done. The fore 
quarter will require from f to 1 hour less. 

BONED QUARTER OF LAMB. 

144. — Take off the shoulder and bone it ; stuff it with fine 
forcemeat, and skewer it in a handsome shape. Braise it with 
2 oz. of butter, add a teacupful of water, stirring the braise 
until the gravy is drawn. Then cut the brisket into pieces, 
and stew them in white gravy ; thicken it with cream and 
eggs so that it shall be very white ; cut the long bones into 
chops and fry them ; thicken the gravy of the braise, add 
haricots, minced truffles, or anything else of vegetable in 
season. Place the shoulder in the centre of a dish with its 
own sauce, lay the brisket covered with white sauce round it, 
and place the fried chops at the edge. 

Lamb a VEspagnole. — An entire lamb is frequently roasted 
in the Peninsula, without any other preparation than merely 
skinning it, taking out the fry, and cutting off the feet. It 

H 



146 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. X. 

is then, however, extremely young — not more than perhaps 6 
weeks or 2 months old ; the bones eat like gristle, and the meat 
is singularly delicate. It is sometimes, but only rarely, stuffed 
with bread and sweet herbs, and served with bread-sauce ; but 
more frequently eaten with lemon-juice. 

All Pascal. — May be a little older, and is also roasted whole, 
but boned from the neck to the shoulders, and the legs fixed 
into the body, which is then covered with slices of bacon, kept 
on with small skewers, or tied with twine ; all, however, being 
removed when the meat is nearly done. Both should be placed 
in a cradle-spit, and will take about 2 hours in roasting. 

TO STEW LA3IB. 

145. — A la Pcrigord. — Put it into a stewpan with a little 
oil, parsley, chives, and mushrooms, or half a dozen black 
truffles, either whole or sliced, together with some trenches of 
bacon. Let it stew gently in any kind of broth, and when 
thoroughly done take it out, strain the gravy, and serve the 
^oint along with the truffles or mushrooms only. To be well 
done it will require 4 hours in stewing. 

Breast of Lamb. — Cut off the thin ends, half boil, then 
strew with crumbs of bread, pepper, and salt ; and serve in a 
dish of stewed mushrooms. 

Cut a Loin of Lamb into steaks, pare off the skin and part 
of the fat, fry it in butter a pale brown, pour away the fat, and 
put in boiling water enough to cover the meat, a little pepper 
and salt, a little nutmeg, -^ pint of green peas, and a coss-let- 
tuce cut lengthways ; cover it down, and let it stew gently for 
^ an hour. 

Shoulder of Lamb. — Bone the shoulder, trim off some of the 
]ean meat, which chop fine with an equal quantity of bacon fat, 
season with spice ; fill up the shoulder and roll it ; braise it 2 
hours over a slow stove ; take it up, glaze it. Serve with 
sorrel or tomata sauce. 

LAMB'S HEAD.—E. R. 

146. — Parboil the head, rub it over with yolk of eggs, cover 
it thickly with chopped herbs, crumbs of bread, and clarified 
butter, and put it into a Dutch oven before the fire. Mince 
the heart and the liver very finely, and stew them in a little 
good gravy, adding a spoonful of lemon-pickle ; make som,e 
tbrcemeat-balls and brain-cakesy and fry them ; place the mince 



^ 



Chap. X. LAMB. 147 

in the dish with the head upon it, and garnish with the balls, 
brain-cakes, sliced lemon, or pickles. 

Lamb's Head and Hinge. — This part is best from a house- 
lamb ; but any will be w^hite if soaked in cold water and boiled 
in a napkin. Boil the head separately till very tender. Have 
ready the liver and lights three parts boiled, and cut small ; 
stew them in a little of the water in which they were boiledj 
season and thicken with flour and butter, and serve the mince 
round the head. 

Or : — Skin the head and split it ; then wash and clean 
thoroughly both it and the entrails — which consist of the 
" liinge " and " fry," — and lay the whole in boiling water for 
■^ an hour ; then take out the heart, liver, and lights ; mince 
them very small ; and toss them up with a quart of either veal 
or mutton broth, a little ketchup, and a spoonful of cream, 
seasoned with pepper and salt. AVhen the head is sufficiently 
boiled, rub it over with yolk of e^^g, and powder it with crumbs 
of bread ; baste it well with butter, and brown it before the 
fire. Keep the mince hot ; and when all is ready, dish the 
mince with the head over it, and the brains made into savoury 
balls as a garnish. 

A little minced bacon is not a bad addition, and parsley, 
thyme, and finely-chopj?ed herbs may be used at pleasure : the 
head may have a squeeze of lemon, and the mince a grating of 
nutmeg. 

LAMB'S FEY. 

147. — Parboil it ; dip it in eggs, then in bread-crumbs, fry 
it crisp, and serve it dry, with fried parsley, without any 
sauce. 

LAMB'S SWEETBREADS. 

148. — Blanch them, and put them into cold water. Then 
put them into a stewpan, with a ladleful of broth, some pepper 
and salt, a small bunch of button onions, a few boiled aspa- 
ragus-tops, and a blade of mace : stir in a bit of butter and 
flour, and stew i an hour. Have ready the yolks of 2 or 3 
eggs well beaten in cream, with a little minced parsley and a 
few grates of nutm.eg. Do not let it boil after the cream is 
in ; but make it hot, and stir it well all the time. Take great 
care it does not curdle. French beans or peas may be added, 
but they should be very young. 

To fricassee Lamb-stones and Siveeth'eads. — Have ready 

h2 



148 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. X. 

some lamb-stones blanched, parboiled, and sliced. Flour 2 or 
3 sweetbreads : if very thick, cut them in two. Fry all toge- 
ther, with a few large oysters, of a fine yellow brown. Pour 
the butter off, and add a pint of good gravy, some asparagus- 
tops about an inch long, a little nutmeg, pepper and salt, 2 
shalots or some chives shred fine, and a glass of white wine. 
Simmer 10 minutes ; then put a little of the gravy to the yolks 
of 3 eggs well beaten, and by degrees mix the whole. Turn 
the gravy back into the pan, and stir it till of a fine thickness 
without boiling. Garnish with lemon. 

To fricassee Lamb-stones. — Skin, wash, and parboil, and 
then cut them in half, dry and flour them ; fry of a beautiful 
brown in hog's lard. Serve with the following sauce : thicken 
some veal gravy v/ith a bit of flour and butter, and then, add 
to it a slice of lemon, a large spoonful of mushroom-ketchup, 
a teaspoonful of lemon-pickle, a grate of nutmeg, and the yolk 
of an eg^ beaten well in 2 large spoonfuls of thick cream.. 
Put this over the fire, and stir it well till it is hot and looks 
white : do not let it boil, or it will curdle. Then put in the 
fry, and shake it about for a minute or two. Serve in a very 
hot dish. 

LA3IB-CH0PS.—E. B. 

149. — Take a loin of lamb, cut chops from it ^ an incJi 
thick, retaining the kidney in its place ; dip them into egg and 
bread-crumbs, fry and serve with fried parsley. 

When chops are made from a breast of lamb, the red bone 
at the edge of the breast should be cut off", and the breast par- 
iDoiled in water or broth, with a sliced carrot and 2 or 3 onions, 
before it is divided into cutlets, which is done by cutting be- 
tween every second or third bone, and preparing them, in every 
respect, as the last. 

If house-lamh steaks are to be done 2vhite — stew them in 
milk and water till very tender, with a bit of lemon-peel, a 
little salt, some pepper and mace. Have ready some veal- 
gravy, and put the steaks into it ; mix some mushroom-powder, 
a cup of cream, and the least bit of flour ; shake the steaks in 
this liquor, stir it, and let it get quite hot, but not boil- Just 
before you take it up, put in a few white mushrooms. 

lihroivn — season them with pepper, salt, nutmeg, grated 
kmon-peel, and chopped parsley ; but dip them first into egg ; 



Chap. X. LAMB. 149 

fry them quickly. Thicken some gravy with a bit of flour and 
butter, and add to it a spoonful of port wine. 

BLANQUETTE D'AGNEAU. 
150. — Cut the best part of the breast of small lamb into 
square pieces of 2 inches each : wash, dry, and flour them. 
Having boiled 4 oz. of butter, 1 of flit bacon, and some parsley, 
10 minutes, put the meat to it : add the juice of ^ a lemon, an 
onion cut small, pepper and salt. Simmer the whole 2 hours ; 
then put in the yolks of 2 eggs, shake the pan over the Are 2 
minutes, and serve. 

EPA ULE D'A GNEA U AU NA TUREL. 

Xo\. — Bone a small fot shoulder of lamb, leaving only \^ 
inc^of the knuckle. Mince a little of the meat from the inside, 
with some bacon fat, white pepper, and salt, and lay it on the 
inner side. With a large needle and coarse thread gather 
together the circumference of the meat, press it flat, and fasten 
the little bone as a handle in its proper place. Then lay at 
the bottom of a stewpan a large sliced onion, h a lemon with- 
out any of the peel, 3 small carrots cut lengthways, and i 
clove ; on these lay the lamb ; and round it put strips of 
bacon about the size of your finger ; throw in a little parsley, 
and cover the meat with veal broth. Set the pan on a very 
slow fire, and place wood embers on the lid. Simmer 2 hours. 
Keep the meat hot while the gravy is strained, and add to it a 
little veloute ; boil very quickly, and throw it over the lamb. 
Put a ruffle of paper on the knuckle. 

It may be served with cucumber, tomata, sorrel, or any 
oUier piquant sauce, after it is glazed. 

PIEDS jyAGNEAU. 
152. — Have 6 lambs' feet scalded, take out the shank-bone 
very carefully, so as not to cut or break the skin ; soak for 
3 hours in cold water ; put them in a stewpan with cold water 
and the juice of 2 lemons ; let it boil for 10 minutes, take out 
the feet, throw them into cold water, cut off the bones of the 
cleft part of the foot, and remove the curl of hair that lies in 
the cleft. Boil very gently for 3 or more hours in some poelee 
(which see) to keep them very white. Serve with asparagus, 
peas, and mushroom or white cucumber sauce. 



J 50 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XL 



CHAPTER XL 

VEAL. 

Directions for choosing veal have already been given. To 
keep it, we have to observe — the first part that turns bad of a 
leg of veal is where the udder is skewered back. The skewer 
should be taken out, and the whole of the meat wiped everj^ 
day ; by which means, if the larder be a good one, it will keep 
good 3 or 4 days in hot weather. Take care to cut out the 
pipe that runs along the chine of a loin, as you do of beef, to 
hinder it from tainting. The skirt of the breast is likewise to 
be taken off, and tlie inside wiped and scraped, and dredged 
with a little flour. 

If veal is in danger of tainting, wash it thoroughly, and 
boil the joint 10 minutes, putting it into the pot when the 
water is boiling hot ; then put it into a very cool larder, or 
plunge it into cold water till cool, and then wipe and put it by. 
If in the least tainted, it cannot be recovered, as brown meats 
are, by the use of charcoal or pyroligneous acid. 

FILLET OF VEAL ROASTED. 

153. — Take a leg of veal, cut off the knuckle sufficiently 
above the joint to make a handsome fillet. Take out the bone, 
fill up the space with stuffing (see Forcemeat), and also put 
a good layer under the fat. Truss it of a good shape by 
drawing the fat round, and tie it up with a tape. Paper it, 
put it a good distance from the fire, as the meat is very solid, 
and must be so thoroughly done as not to leave the least 
appearance of red gravy ; serve it with melted butter poured 
over, and gravy round. Ham or bacon should be served with 
it, and fresh cucumbers if in season. 

In Paris, a loiige de veau is cut somewhat in the shape of 
a haunch of mutton, with the fillet and part of the loin joined 
to*''ether. 

° * FILLET OF VEAL BOILED. 

154. — Choose a small delicate fillet for this purpose ; pre- 
pare as for roasting, or stuff it with an oyster forcemeat ; after 
having washed it thoroughly, cover it with milk and water in 
equal quantities, and let it boil very gentlv 3i or 4 hours, 



Chap. XI. VEAL. 151 

keeping it carefully skimmed. Send it to table with a ricli 
white sauce, or, if stuffed with oj^sters, a tureen of oyster- 
sauce ; garnish with stewed celery and slices of bacon. A 
boiled tongue should be served with it. 

LOIN OF VEAL ROASTED. 

155. — Run a lark-spit along the chine-bones; then tie the 
ends of the lark-spit on the usual spit, drawing down the flap 
over the kidney. Cover it well with buttered paper, and tie 
it up carefully ; let it roast gently for 3 hours. When nearly 
done, remove the paper, sprinkle the meat with salt, dredge it 
with flour, and finish basting with a small piece of fresh butter. 

This joint is frequently divided ; the kidney end and the 
chump. The kidney end sent up with a toast under the fat ; 
the chump end should be stuffed like the fillet, or sent up with 
balls of stuffing in the dish ; pour melted butter over the joint, 
and gravy round. It also forms an excellent stew if served up 
in winter with rice, and in summer with green peas. 

BREAST OF VEAL. 

156. — Cover it with the caul, and, if you retain the sweet- 
bread, skewer it to the back, but take off the caul when the 
meat is nearly done : it will take 2^ to 3 hours roasting ; serve 
with melted butter and gravy. 

Or : — Eemove the tendons,"^ and insert in their place a 
stuffing ; then roast as before. 

Or : — Raise the skin, and force in as much stuffing as pos- 
sible ; skewer it up ; this will give a very good flavour to the 
joint. 

To stezo. — Cut a breast, or a portion, in pieces ; fry them 
with a little butter, an onion, and a cabbage-lettuce shred 
small ; when browned, add a little flour, shake it well together ; 
then add a small quantity of broth or water ; let it stew gently. 
When the veal is three parts done, take a quart of peas, put 
them in water, and handle them with a little butter, so that 
they adhere together ; take away nearly all the gravy from 
the veal, and put in the peas. When both are done add pepper, 
salt, and a little pounded sugar ; thicken the peas with flour 
?ind butter, dish up the veal, and pour the peas over. There 
should be very little sauce with the peas. 

Cut a handsome piece, put it into a stewpan with a piece 

* See Tendons, p. 159. 



152 . MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

of butter, a pint of water, an onion, a stick of celery, and some 
white pepper and salt : let it draw gently for some time, then 
cover it with hot water, and allow it to stew until perfectly ten- 
der. Eemove any skin that may be about it, and thicken a 
part of the stock with cream, flour, and butter ; cover it with 
the sauce, and serve it up. Mushrooms pickled white may be 
added to the sauce, or stewed celery. 

Or : — Cut the pieces into handsome sizes, put them into a 
stewpan, and pour some broth or water over them : add a 
bunch of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, an 
onion, and an anchovy ; stew till the meat is tender, thicken 
with butter and flour, and add a little ketchup. The whole 
breast may be stewed, after cutting ofl' the two ends, or dividing 
it into pieces, which should be first slightly browned. 

Cut the veal into handsome pieces, put them into a jar with 
1 or 2 dozen oysters, and their liquor strained, and a piece of 
butter rolled in flour ; put the jar into a kettle of water, and 
let it stew until tender. If the veal has been cooked, merely 
w^arm it up with the oysters in w^hite sauce. 

Serve the sweetbread whole upon it, which may either be 
stewed or parboiled, and then covered with crumbs, herbs, 
pepper and salt, and brovv-ned in a Dutch oven ; or, if you 
have a few mushrooms, truffles, and morels, stew them with it, 
and serve. 

Boiled breast of veal, smothered with onion sauce, is an ex- 
cellent dish. 

SHOULDER OF VEAL. 

157. —Cut off* the knuckle for a stew or gravy. Roast the 
other part with a stuffing, vvhich should be inserted both under 
the flap of the under side, and also just below where the 
knuckle has been cut off*; you may lard it. Serve with 
melted butter. 

The blade-bone, with a good deal of meat left on, eats ex- 
tremely well, when grilled, with mushroom or oyster sauce, or 
mushroom ketchup in butter. 

Being a large joint of what is considered rather coarse meat, 
it is rarely serNcd to any but plain family parties ; but, if 
braised, it makes an excellent dish. 

NECK OF VEAL. 
158.--Take the best end of a neck of veal, cut off" the ends 
of the bones, and turn the flap over : saw off the chine-bone,

or joint it thoroughly ; paper it, and baste it well all the 
time it is roasting. Larding the fillet or thick part is a great 
improvement. The lean end of the neck makes an excellent 
stew, with rice, onions, and a little seasoning. 

Or: — Take the best end of a small neck; cut the bones 
short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just 
covered with brown gravy ; and when it is nearly done, have 
ready a pint of boiled peas, 3 or 4 cucumbers, and 2 cabbage- 
lettuces cut into quarters, all stewed in a little good broth ; 
put them to the veal, and let them simmer for 10 minutes. 
When the veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables 
over it, and lay the lettuce round it. This is an excellent 
summer stew. 

Neck of Veal a la Braise. — Cut off the ends of the long 
bones, and saw off the chine-bones ; raise the skin of the fillet ; 
lard it very close, and tie it up neatly. Put the scrag end, a 
little lean bacon or ham, an onion, 2 carrots, 2 heads of celery, 
and about a glass of Madeira wine into a stewpan. Lay on 
them the neck, add a little water, and stew it 2 hours, or till it 
is tender, but not too much. Strain off the liquor ; mix a 
little flour and butter in a stewpan till brown : stir some of the 
liquor in, and boil it up : skim it nicely, and squeeze orange 
or lemon juice into it, and serve with the meat. The bacon 
should be browned with a salamander and glazed. It may 
also be served with spinach or sorrel. 

KNUCKLE OF VEAL. 
159. — Soak it 2 hours in cold water, and boil it in a cloth. 
Serve with plain parsley and butter, or oyster sauce and stewed 
celery. 

Oi' : — Break the bones, to make it take less room ; wash it 
well, and put it into a saucepan with 3 onions, a blade or two 
of mace, and a few peppercorns ; cover it with water, and 
simmer it till quite tender. Some macaroni or rice should be 
boiled with it, or thicken the gravy with a little rice-flour, 
but do not put too much. Before it is served add i pint of 
milk and cream. The meat may be served in the soup, or on 
a separate dish. If the latter, it may be covered Avith onion 
sauce. Bacon and greens are usually eaten with boiled veal. 
Put chopped parsley for garnish. 

Or : — Fry the knuckle with sliced onions and butter to a 
good brown ; put to it either gravy or water ; stew it till 

h3 



154 MO'DEPiX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

tlie meat is tender ; have ready peas^ lettuce, onion, and a 

cucumber or two stewed ; add these to the veal ; simmer for 

i of an hour. Season with pepper and salt, and serve all 

to<^ether. 

1311 TA TION OF MO CK- T UR TLB. 

160. — Put into a pan a knuckle of veal, 2 line cow-heels 
or 2 calf's feet, 2 onions, a few cloves, peppers, berries of all- 
spice, mace, and sweet herbs ; cover them with water, then tip 
a thick paper over the pan, and set it in an oven for 3 hours. 
When cold, take off the fat very nicely ; cut the meat and feet 
into bits l^ inch square ; remove the bones and coarse parts ; 
and then put the rest on to warm, with a large spoonful of 
walnut and one of mushroom ketchup, half a pint of sherry or 
Madeira wine, a little mushroom-powder, and the jelly of the 
meat. When hot, if it wants any more seasoning, add some ; 
and serve with hard eggs, forcemeat-balls, a squeeze of lemon, 
and a spoonful of soy. 

This is a very easy way, and the dish is excellent. 

CALF'S HEAD. 

161. — Observe: the skin should always be left on calves' 
1 leads, otherwise they are scarcely worth the pains bestowed 
in dressing them. 

Take a calf's-head, remove the brains and the tongue, also 
the gristle that forms the nose, and the eye; soak it for 2 
hours in lukewarm water to make it look white, and to draw 
out the blood from the heck portion of it. Put it in cold 
water, and skim it very carefully ; let it boil very gently until 
rather well done than otherwise ; take it up, throw it into 
cold water, brush it over with eggs, and sprinkle crumbs, 
mixed with chopped parsley and marjoram, over it ; brown it 
v/ell in the oven, and serve it with brown caper or tomata 
sauce. Having soaked in warm water and carefully cleaned 
the brains, boil them in water with a little lemon-juice, chop 
them fine, add a tablespoonful of melted butter, some sea- 
soning, and chopped parsley ; boil the tongue, skin it, and 
serve the brain-sauce round it. 

Hashed Calfs-head. — When half boiled, cut off the meat 
in slices t inch thick, and 2 or 3 inches long : brown some 
butter, flour, and sliced onion, and throw in the slices with 
some good gravy, and morels or mushrooms ; give it one boil 
and skim it well, and set it in a moderate heat to simmer till 



Chap. XI. YEAL. 15^ 

very tender. Season with pepper, salt, and cayenne at first ; 
and 10 minutes before serving throw in some shred parsley, 
with a very small bit of knotted marjoram cut as fine as 
possible : add the squeeze of a lemon and a glass of white 
wine. Garnish with forcemeat-balls and bits of bacon roiled 
round. 

Fricasseed Calfs-head. — Clean and half boil a head ; cut 
the meat into small bits, and put it into a stewpan, with a 
little gravy made of the bones, a bunch of sweet herbs, an 
onion, and a blade of mace. Season the gravy with a little 
pepper, nutmeg, and salt, rub down some flour and butter, 
and give all a boil together ; then take out the herbs and 
onion, and add a little cup of cream, but do not boil it. 
Serve with small bits of bacon rolled round and forcemeat- 
balls. 

Bailed CaJfs-liead. — Mix pepper, salt, bread-crumbs, and 
chopped sage together ; rub the head over with butter, and 
put the seasoning upon it ; cut the brains in 4 pieces, and rub 
them over with crumbs ; lay the head in a deep dish, witli 
the brains ; put a piece of butter into each eye, with plenty of 
the crumbs also, fill the dish nearly full of water, and let it 
bake 2 hours in a quick oven. 

Calfs-head Rayodt. — Parboil the head, and cut oft' tlie 
meat into thin broad pieces, return the bones to the water in 
which it was boiled, with a beef-bone or a piece of gravy beef, 
and ham or bacon bones ; add herbs, and, making 2 quarts of 
good gravy, strain it, and put in the meat. "When it has 
stewed i of an hour, add an anchovy, a little beaten mace, 
cayenne pepper, 2 spoonfuls of lemon-pickle, ^ oz. of truffles and 
morels, a slice or two of lemon, and a glass of wine : thicken 
the gravy with butter and flour, adding forcemeat-balls fried, 
paste fried, and brain-cakes as a garnish. 

Rolled Calfs-head. — Boil the head gently until the bone 
will leave the meat easily ; take some fine forcemeat, made 
with ham, egg-balls, and small pieces of very nice pickled pork 
previously boiled : lay them evenly over the inside of one half 
of the head, and roll it up ; tie it lightly in a cloth ; put it 
into a stewpan to braise ; cut the other portion of the head 
into small pieces ; thicken and flavour the stock in which it 
was boiled, and warm it up in it, adding forcemeat and egg- 
balls, brain-cakes, and fried paste. Place the rolled head in 



156 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Cpiap. XL 

the centre of the disli, with the hash round, and the brain- 
cakes, fried paste, and slices of lemon as garnish. Truffles 
may be added with advantage to any dish composed of calf's- 
head. 

HASHED VEAL. 

162. — If to he hashed, from any joint not overdone cut 
thin slices, remove the skin and gristle, put some sliced onions 
and a shalot over the fire with a piece of butter and some 
liour : fry and shake them. Put in some veal gravy and 
a bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer 10 minutes ; strain off the 
gravy, and put it to the veal, with some parsley chopped 
small, and a little grated lemon-peel and nutmeg ; let it 
simmer 1 minute. 

If to be stewed, then add the yolks of 2 eggs, beaten up with 
2 spoonfuls of cream and a very little pepper, and stir over 
the fire one way until it becomes thick and smooth ; squeeze a 
little lemon-juice in, and serve. 

SCOTCH COLLOPS.~E. R. 

163. — Take a slice of the leg of veal ; cut the collops thin 
the size of a crown-piece ; flatten them with a beater ; have 
a large dish, dredge it with flour, and sprinkle a little black 
pepper over it : as the collops are flattened, lay them in the 
dish ; put a piece of butter in a frying-pan, and, when it is 
melted and hot, lay in the collops ; do them quickly ; when 
lightly browned dish them up, and serve with a mushroom 
sauce. 

If broiun, cut the collops thin, beat them a little, fry them 
in butter for about 2 minutes, after having seasoned them 
with a little beaten mace ; place them in a deep dish as they 
are fried, and cover them with gravy. Put some butter into 
the ftying-pan, and allow it just to change colour. Then 
strain the collops through a colander from the gravy, and fry 
them quickly ; pour the burnt butter from the pan, and put 
in the gravy, adding a little lemon-juice. The gravy may be 
made of the trimmings of the veal : serve it up with force- 
meat-ballsi 

If u'hite, cut the collops the size of a crown-piece, and not 
much thicker : butter the bottom of the stewpan, and lay the 
meat piece by piece upon it, having shaken a little flour upon 
the butter ; add '2 blades of mace and a little nutmeg. Set 
t]3e stewpan on the fire, and toss it together until the meat is 



Chap. XI. VEAL. 157 

very white ; then add i pint of strong veal broth and i pint 
of cream ; toss the whole, and, when simmered enough, let 
them just boil. Add a little lemon-juice, some forcemeat-balls, 
and either oysters or mushrooms, which must both be very 
white : if necessary, thicken the sauce with the yolk of eggs, 
but do not let it boil afterwards. 

To dress Collops quickhj. — Cut them as thin as paper with 
a ver}' sliarp knife, and in small bits. Throw the skin, and 
any odd bits of the veal, into a little water, with a dust of 
pepper and salt : set them on the fire while you beat the 
collops. and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, pepper, 
salt, and a scrape of nutmeg, but first wet them in egg. Then 
put a bit of butter into a frying-pan, and give the collops a 
very quick fry ; for as they are so thin, 2 minutes will do them 
on both sides : put them into a hot dish before the fire ; then 
strain and thicken the gravy. 

VEAL CUTLETS.— E. R. 

164. — Cutlets are cut either from the fillet or the neck, but 
chops are taken from the loin. Some persons have deprecated 
the practice of beating meat, but it is essentially necessar}' in 
veal cutlets, which otherwise, especially if merely fried, are 
verj' indigestible. They should be cut about i or. at the most, 
■5- an inch in thickness, and well beaten ; they will then, when 
fried, taste like sweetbread, be quite as tender, and nearly as 
rich. Egg them over, dip in bread-crumbs and savoury herbs, 
iY\. and serve with mushroom sauce and fried bacon. 

Or : — Prepare as above and fry them ; lay them in a dish, 
and keep them hot : dredge a little flour, and put a bit of 
butter into the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boiling water 
into it, and boil quickl}- : season ^snth pepper, salt, and ketchup, 
and pour it over them. 

Cutlets and Rice. — ^Boil a cupful of rice in milk until quite 
soft, then pound it in a mortar with a little salt and some white 
pepper ; pound also separately equal parts of cold veal or 
chicken ; mix them together with yolk of egg. form them into 
cutlets, brush over with yolk of egg. and fr^- them : send them 
up with a ver}' piquant sauce, made of good stock, thickened, 
and flavoured with lemon-juice, lemon pickle, or Harvey's 
sauce. The cutlets may be sent to table covered with the small 
pickled mushrooms. 



158 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

Ciiflets and Celery. — The cutlets may be cut from the best 
part of the neck, taking care in remoAiug the meat from the 
bones to cut it in a good shape. Put the bones and trimmings 
at the bottom of a ste'vrpau, with 3 or 4 heads of celery cut 
and scalded, a little salt, pepper, and stewed onion ; lay on 
these the cutlets ; stew until tender. Take out the cutlets, 
strain the gra'vy. thicken it with flour and butter, add to it 
the best pieces of the celery-, garnish with lemon in slices, and 
small forcemeat-balls tried. 

A r Italienne. — Chop a quantity of sweet herbs, parsley 
being predominant : melt a little butter on the fire and then 
warm the herbs in it ; cut the cutlets into handsome shapes, 
brush them with the yolk of an e^^. then lay on the butter a^id 
herbs with a knife, and cover them well with bread-crumbs. 
This process should be repeated ; fry them of a fine brown : if 
glazed, they must be put between papers to press all the gi-ease 
out. then bru^h them over with the glaze, and send them to 
table. Serve with Italian sauce. 

A hi Hollandaise. — Cut some large cutlets from a fillet of 
veal, beat them weli. then dip them into batter made very rich 
with e^. Make a fine forcemeat with pomided ham. chopped 
oysters, &c., lay it upon the cutlets, roll them up. dip them 
again in egg-batter, roll them in bread-crumbs, and tie them 
up ; roast them upon skewers or in a Dutch oven ; chop and 
pound the trimmings of the veal, add them to the oysters and 
ham forcemeat with 2 raw eggs, make it into balls and fr}' 
them. Have some stock ready and stew it with an anchovy-, a 
shalot, some white pepper and salt ; strain and thicken it with 
butter, add the juice of i a lemon and a glass of white wine ; 
give it one boil and pour it into the dish, with the rolled cutlets 
in the centre and the balls romid them. 

A la Hollandaise. iciih Wliite Sauce. — Cut thin slices of 
undressed vcal. hack them with the back of a knife each way. dip 
them in eggs and bread-crumbs, with a little chopped paisley, 
frv them in butter, lay them on a sieve as they are done, and 
serve them with white sauce as for fricassee. 

FARCIES OF TEAL. 

165. — Chop off the chine-bone of a small neck of veM to 
♦he end of the fifth rib ; divide the cutlets, and with a broad 
knife beat the meat of each flat, and cover it with forcemeat of 



CiiA?. XT. VEAL. 159 

lean veal, beef suet, parsley, a small bit of garlic, a little salt, 
jnace. and pepper. Then roll the meat round, the bone, the end 
of which leave out at one extremity, put over a thin slice of fat 
bacon, and, having stuffed in the remainder of the forcemeat at 
the ends of the roll, bind up with twine. At the bottom of a 
small stewpan lay slices of turnip, onion, 3 inches of celery, 
and 2 large carrots cut lengthways, and tlie steaks over ; add 
as much water, or beef-broth, as shall half cover them : set the 
pan on a moderate stove, and some wood embers on the lid ; 
simmer slowly 2 hours, then remove the twine, and placing 
the bones upwards, leaning on each other, strain the gravy over 
them. 

Or : — Take cutlets from the chump end of a loin of veal, 
beat them vrell, cover them with slices of bacon, then with a 
line forcemeat ; roll them round ; tie them into shape ; then 
dip them in the yolks of eggs and the raspings of bread ; roast 
them, basting well with butter ; then put them into a sauce 
thickened with mushrooms, squeeze lemon-juice over them, 
let them stew till very tender, and serve them up. 

ROLLED VEAL.—E.R. 

166. — Put the breast into a stewpan with just water enough 
to cover it, an onion, a stick of celery, and a bundle of sweet 
herbs ; let it stew very gently, adding more water as it stews, 
until it is tender ; then take out the bones, and remove the 
skin ; return the bones into the liquor, which will be a fine jelly, 
and serve as the sauce for several dishes. Cover the veal with 
u fine forcem.eat, season it well, add egg-balls, and roll it up, 
securing it with tape. Put it into a stewpan with the fat pro- 
cured from pork chops, a slice or two of fat bacon or a lump 
of butter, and a teacupful of the liquor it was stewed in ; shake 
the stewpan about until the fat has melted, and turn the veal in 
it, that it may be all equally done, adding an onion and another 
bunch of herbs ; let it braise H or 2 hours, then strain the 
gravy, and thicken it ; garnish with forcemeat-balls, egg-balls, 
and fried paste cut in sha})es. Peeled mushrooms may be 
given by way of variety. When well done, this is an ex- 
cellent dish. 

TENDONS DE VEAU. 

167. — The tendons de veau are the gristle that is found in the 
breast of veal at the extremity of the bones ; it must be cut out 
from the meat before cooking. Lay the breast on the table 



160 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

with the bones upwards, and with a sharp knife cut the tendons 
off the ribs : the place where the tendons begin and the ribs 
end being shown by a line of white gristle. The breast can 
then be roasted or stewed, replacing the tendon by a good 
stuffing. 

Tendons aux Epinards. — Take the tendons out of the 
breast of veal, cut them in pieces 6 inches long, envelop them 
in a sheet of bacon fat, tie them up carefully, braise them with 
trimmings of veal, an onion, carrot, bay-leaf, 2 or 3 cloves, 
faggot of parsley, and thyme. Let them simmer gently, until 
so thoroughly done that a skewer passes through easily. Take 
them up, put tliem on a dish with a slight weight on them. 
When cold, cut them in slices \ an inch thick, warm them in 
a little gravy, glaze them : serve on stewed spinach or sorrel, 
or with tomata-sauce. 

Tendons a la Villeroy. — Cut the tendons in slices ; lay 
them in a marinade of oil, vinegar, lemon, onions, &c., for 3 
hours ; dry them, dip in batter, fry : serve with tomata-sauce. 

FRICANDEA U OF VEAL.—E. R. 

168. — Cut a handsome piece from the fillet, lard it all over 
as thickly as possible ; put it into a stewpan with a few slices 
of fat bacon, some trimmings of veal, a carrot, turnip, and a 
head of celery, a few allspice, 2 blades of mace, and 4 bay- 
leaves ; let it stew very gently until thoroughly done, boil the 
gravy down to a glaze, cover the veal with it, and serve it 
upon a puree of sorrel. Grenadines of veal are cooked in the 
same way, only made of smaller pieces, 4 for a dish. 

In France the fricandeau is not unfrequently larded in the 
interior as well as the outside, by having pieces of the size of a 
little finger cut off the meat with an instrument something like 
a cheese-taster, and then refilled with pledgets of bacon, or 
" lardons^'' The meat is also very generally served upon 
spinach, dresse(j).%ith cream or sorrel. 

FRICANDELS. 
169. — Take 3 lbs. of the best end of a loin of veal, chop the 
fat and lean together very fine ; then soak a French roll in 
some milk ; beat 3 eggs ; add pepper, salt, nutmeg, and mace. 
Make the mixture up about the size and somewhat in the shape 
of a small chicken ; rub it over with ^^^ and bread-crumbs, 
fry until it is brown, pour off the fat, boil water m the pan, 



Chap. XI. VEAL. 161 

and stew the fricandels in this gravy : two will make a hand- 
some dish. Thicken the gravy before it is sent to table. 

MIROTON OF VEAL. 

170. — Chop very fine some cold dressed veal and ham or 
bacon ; mix it with a slice of crumb of bread soaked in milk 
and squeezed dry, 2 onions chopped and browned, a little salt, 
pepper, and a little cream. Put all these ingredients into a 
stewpan until they are hot, and are well mixed together ; then 
add 1 or 2 eggs according to the quantity, butter a mould, put 
in the whole, and bake it in an oven until it is brov/n ; turn it 
out of the mould, and serve with fresh gravy. 

A GALANTINE.— E. R. 
171. — Take out the long bones from a breast of veal, and 
beat the veal for 4 minutes with the flat part of a hand-chopper, 
in order that it may roll easily. Spread it on the table, and 
brush it over thickly with the yolk of an egg, and then sprinkle 
it with chopped herbs ; season with pepper, salt, and pounded 
mace : make 2 omelettes, one of the yolk and one of the white 
of egg ; cut them in strips ; lay them upon the veal, with 
layers of farce between ; cut some pickled cucumbers or 
mushrooms into small pieces, with some sweet herbs well 
seasoned ; strew them over the surface, then roll up the veal 
very tightly, tie it in a cloth, and let it stew gently for 6 hours ; 
then put a heavy weight upon it, and let it stand 2 days be 
fore it is cut. Serve it in slices, with savoury jelly : any kina 
of boned game or fowl may be added. It requires to be 
highly seasoned. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

I "2. — Cut long thin slices, beat them, lay them on thin 
slices of fat bacon, and over these a layer of forcemeat, seasoned 
high with some shred shalot and cayenne. Eoll them tight, 
about the size of 2 fingers, but not more than 2 or 3 inches 
long ; fasten them round witli small skewers, rub egg over 
them, and bake them of a light brown. Serve with brown 
gravy, in which boil some mushrooms, pickled or fresh. 
Garnish with balls fried. 

HARICOT OF VEAL. 
173.' — -Take the best end of a small neck ; cut the bones 
short, but leave it whole ; then put it into a stewpan just 
covered with brown gravy ; and when it is nearly done, have 



1G2 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

ready a pint of stewed peas, 4 cucumbers pared and sliced, 2 
cabbage-lettuces cut into quarters, and ^- pint of carrots and 
turnips cut in shapes, all stewed in a little good broth ; put 
them to the veal, and let them simmer 10 minutes. When the 
veal is in the dish, pour the sauce and vegetables over it, and 
lay the lettuce with forcemeat-balls round it. 

CALVES' FEET.— E.R. 

174. — Stewed. — ^Wlien properly cleaned, rub the feet over 
with pepper, a very little salt, and mace ; cut them into 
moderately-sized pieces, and put them into a stewpan with a 
little shalot, and a beefsteak, also cut into pieces. Cover all 
\vith cold water, and let them simmer together for 3 hours. 
When quite tender, take them off the fire ; strain the gravy 
through a sieve. The next day, when cold, take off all the 
fat ; boil a small quantity of saffron in cream, and a little 
cayenne pepper ; mix it with the gravy, and warm the whole 
without boiling : 1 foot and 1 lb. of steak will make a dish. 

Fricasseed. — Boil the feet in water until the bones will 
come out, with an onion and a bunch of sweet herbs ; take the 
bones out, and when the meat is cold stuff it nicely with a 
very fine farce, or forcemeat ; make the pieces up into hand- 
some shapes of an equal size ; then take some of the stock in 
which the feet were boiled, removing the fat, and straining it 
when melted ; make this into thick white sauce with cream 
and roux ; warm up the calves' feet in it, and send it to table 
either plain or with a quantity of asparagus tops, previously 
boiled, and cut into small pieces. 

Or : — Boil tender 2 feet in a shallow pan, observing not to 
break them ; throw them into cold water for an hour ; divide, 
and lay them in a little weak veal broth, and simmer them 
^ an hour, with a blade of mace and a bit of lemon-peel, which 
take out when you add ^ a teacupful of cream, and a bit of 
Hour and butter. 

Fried. — Take calves' feet w^hich have been boiled until very 
tender, remove the bones, let them get cold, cut them into 
well-shaped pieces, season them with white pepper and salt, 
dip them into batter, fry them, and serve them up with a 
sharp sauce or garnish of pickles. 

Calves' feet may also be plainly boiled, and served! with 
parsley and butter, or eaten cold with oil and vinegar. 



Chap. XL VEAL. 163 

QUEUES BE VEAU. 

175. — Having nicely cleaned and soaked 4 calves' tails, cut 
them in pieces 2 inches long, leaving out the small ends, and 
blancli them ; dry, flour, and fry them a fine brown in butter ; 
drain the fat from them, and, having ready a pint of weak 
broth, with a bunch of sweet herbs, chives or green onions, 

2 bay-leaves, -g- pint of mushrooms, pepper and salt, boiled up 
and skimmed, wipe the sides of the stewpan, put the tails in, 
and simmer very slowly until they are quite tender ; keep 
them hot while the gravy is strained, and boiled to a glaze, to 
cover them. If you have no mushrooms, mix a little of the 
povt'der into the gravy just before serving ; have ready small 
onions, and peel to one size to send up in the dish. 

CALVES EARS STUFFED. 

176, — The hair being scalded off the ears, after they have 
been cut quite close to the head, scald and clean them as well 
as possible ; boil them quite tender, and blanch them in cold 
water. Observe that the gristle next the head be cut so 
smooth as to allow the ears to stand upright ; they may be 
boiled in white gravy instead of water, which will make them 
richer. When cold, fill up the cavity with a fine stuffing of 
calf's liver, fat bacon, grated ham, bread soaked in cream or 
gravy, herbs, an unbeaten egg, a little salt, and a small piece 
of mace ; rub egg over the ears and stuffing, dip in bread- 
crumbs, and iYj of a beautiful light brown. Serve in brown 
or white gravy, or tomata-sauce. If the ear be large, one 
will be sufficient for a corner dish. 

Or : — When prepared as above, boil them quite tender in 
gravy, and serve them in chervil-sauce ; or else boil chervil 
to a mash, put to it melted butter, pass it through a sieve, and 
add to it white sauce, or use the latter solely, in which case 
put a little mushroom-powder into it ; the same forcemeat 
may be used, or the ears may be served without. They like- 
wise eat well served in white or brown gravy, cut into slices. 
In the latter case, fry them before stev/ed in gravy. 

CALVES' BRAINS.— E. R. 
177. — Eemove all the large fibres and skin ; soak them in 
warm water for 4 hours ; blanch them for 10 minutes in boil- 
ing water, with a little salt and vinegar in it ; then soak them 

3 hours in lemon-juice in which a bit of chervil has been 



164 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKEr.Y. Chap. XL 

steeped ; dry them well, dip them in batter, and fry them. 
Make hot a ladleful of glaze, some extremely small onio::s 
browned in butter, artichoke bottoms divided in half, and 
some mushroom-buttons, and serve round the brains. 

Or : — Having prepared them, cut them in slices ^ an inch 
thick ; flour, egg, and bread-crumb them, fry them a nice 
brown, and serve with tomata-sauce. Tv/o pair of brains will 
make a good dish. 

Or : — Blanch the brains, and beat them up with an egg, 
pepper, and salt, a small quantity of chopped parsley, and a 
piece of butter. Make them into small cakes, put them into 
a small frying-pan, and fry them. 

Or : — Prepare them as above : wet with egg, and sprinkle 
crumbs, salt, pepper, and chopped parsley, and finish dressing 
in a Dutch oven. Serve with melted butter, with or without 
a little mushroom-ketchup. 

Croquettes of Brains. — Take calf's brains, blanch, and 
beat them up with 1 or 2 chopped sage-leaves, a little pepper 
and salt, a few bread-crumbs soaked in milk, and an egg 
beaten ; roll them into balls, and fry them. 

Cervelles de Veau au Marinade. — Cut a carrot, a turnip, 
and an onion into pieces ; let them stew in a little butter ; 
then add a bundle of sweet herbs, and pour over them a pint 
of vinegar and water in equal parts ; then strain the liquor, 
and pour it over calves' brains cleaned and blanched ; let 
them stew in it till they are firm, then fry them in butter, and 
serve up with crisped parsley. 

Cervelles de Veau Fricassees. — Having cleared and blanched 
the brains, render them white and firm by squeezing lemon- 
juice over them ; then put them into a stewpan with a piece 
of butter ; stew slowly, that they may not brov/n ; dredge in 
a small quantity of flour ; add a bunch of parsley, and 1 of 
chives ; moisten with clear veal broth ; let the brains stew 
until they are firm ; then send them up in the sauce, thickened 
with a little cream and flour and butter. 

CALF'S LIVER, ETC.—E. 11. 

178. — Cut the liver rather thin, say about ^ inch thick, but 
first soak it in warm water for an hour ; chop a quantity of 
parsley, season it with pepper, and lay it thick upon the liver; 
cut slices of bacon, and fry both together, but put the bacon 



Chap. XL YEAL. 165 

first into the pan ; add a little lemon-pickle to the gravy made 
by pouring the fat out of the pan, flouring, and adding boil- 
ing water. 

Or : — Cut the liver in handsome pieces, lard them very 
nicely, and chop some parsley and spread it over the surface 
^vith a little pepper and salt ; put a small piece of butter well 
mixed with flour in the bottom of a stewpan, put in the liver, 
and allow it to stew gently in its own juices until it is done 
enough. 

Lii'er and Lights. — Half boil an equal quantity of each : 
then cut them into a middling-size mince ; put to it a spoonful 
or two of the water they were boiled in, a bit of butter, flour, 
salt, and pepper ; simmer 10 minutes, and serve hot. 

Calfs Heart. — Stuff" and roast the same as beef heart ; or, 
being sliced and seasoned, make it into a pudding as directed 
for steak or kidney pudding. It may be either roasted or 
baked, but in either way should be well basted, stuflfed with 
forcemeat as for veal, but m.ade rather more savoury, and 
served up in the same manner as beef heart. 

When the kidney is cut from the loin and dressed sepa* 
rately, chop it up with some of the fat ; with a little leek or 
onion, pepper, and salt. Veal forcemeat may ^Iso be used, 
but it rather weakens the pungency of the seasoning. Eoll it 
up v>dth an egg into balls, and fry them. 

SJVEETBREADS. 

179. — For every mode of dressing, sweetbreads should be 
prepared by blanching, or rather parboiling them. 

They may be larded and braised ; and, being of themselves 
rather insipid, they will be improved by a relishing sauce, and 
by a large quantity of herbs in the braise. Slices of lemon 
put upon the sweetbreads while braising will heighten the 
flavour and keep them white, which is very desirable when 
sent to table with white sauce. Stufled with oysters, they 
make a very good vol an vent. 

Siveethreads a la Dauhe. — Blanch 2 or 3 of the largest 
sweetbreads ; lard them ; put them into a stewpan, with some 
good veal gravy, a little brov/ning, and the juice of -^ a lemon ; 
stew them till quite tender, and just before serving thicken 
with flour and butter ; glaze them ; serve with 'their gravy, 
find bunches of stewed celery round the dish. 



166 M0DEK:?T domestic COOKEEY. Chap. XL 

Sweetbreads stewed. — After blanching, stuff them with a 
forcemeat of fowl, fat and lean bacon, an anchovy, nutmeg, 
lemon-peel, parsley, and a very little cayenne and thyme ; 
when well mixed, add the yolks of 2 eggs, and fill the sweet- 
breads. Fasten them together with splinter-skewers, and lay 
them in a pan, with slices of veal over, and bacon under them ; 
season with pepper and salt, mace, cloves, herbs, and sliced 
onion ; cover close over the fire 10 minutes, then add a quart 
of broth, and stew gently 1 hour ; take out the sweetbreads, 
strain and skim the broth, and boil it to ^ pint ; warm the 
sweetbreads in it, and serve with lemon round. 

Fried. — Cut them in slices about f inch thick, drj^ and 
flour, egg them, and dip them into fine bread-crumbs ; fry 
them of a light brown ; serve on spinach, endive, or sorrel ; 
or cut some toasted bread, dish them on it, and serve thera 
with a sauce piquante. 

For an invalid, boil them well, cover them with bread- 
crumbs, a little pepper and salt, with a small bit of butter ; 
brown them lightly with a salamander. 

Roasted. — Blanch, dry, egg and bread-crumb them ; pass 
a small skewer through each ; tie them on a spit ; roast 
gently ; baste with fresh butter ; serve nicely frothed, and a 
mushroom-sauce under them. 

Fricasseed white. — Blanch and slice them ; thicken some 
veal gravy with flour and butter mixed, a little cream, a little 
mushroom-powder, and add white pepper, nutmeg, and grated 
lemon-peel ; stew these mgredients together a little, then 
simmer the sweetbreads 20 minutes. When taken off the fire, 
add a little salt ; stir well, and serve. 

Fricasseed brown. — Cut them about the size of a walnut, 
flour, and fry them of a fine brown ; pour to them a good beef 
gravy, seasoned with salt, pepper, cayenne, and allspice ; 
simmer till tender ; thicken with flour and butter. Morels, 
truffles, and mushrooms may be added, and mushroom 
ketchup. 

Croquettes. — Take 2 sweetbreads, a little onion chopped 
fine, mixed with a small piece of butter, 1 egg, and a little 
cream ; seagon with white pepper, cayenne, and salt. This 
will make 8 or 9 croquettes. Roll them in egg and then in 
bread-crumbs ; fry them in lard a nice brown colour ; strew 



Chap. XI. VEAL. 167 

them in a circle round the dish, and serve fried parsley in the 
centre. 

Cold veal chopped, and stewed in a little grav}-, and when 
cold made up as above, makes excellent croquettes. 

RIS DE VEAU EN CAISSES. 

180. — Blanch 3 sweetbreads, and simmer in a strong, well- 
flavoured gravy till quite done. Have ready 3 round trays 
of white paper oiled, and lay them therein ; having left them 
lightly wetted with gravy, sprinkle over them the finest crumbs 
or raspings of bread, pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg ; 
do them slowly on a gridiron, and serve in the cases. Any of 
the vegetable sauces may be served with them. 

GARNITURE EN RAGOUT. 

• 

181 . — Having prepared and blanched sweetbreads of veal or 
lamb (house-lamb is the best), liver of lamb and rabbits, truf- 
fles and mushrooms, simmer gently i an hour in rich veal 
broth ; then divide the several articles into fit bits for help- 
ing, and stew the whole till very tender. If, when finished, 
the gravy wants consistency, boil up in it a good piece of 
butter rolled in flour. Season it, 15 minutes before serving, 
with white pepper, salt, and nutmeg only. Have ready and 
hot, forcemeat-balls, in which finely-scraped ham, beef-suet, 
the breast of a fowl, or cold veal, are the principal ingredients. 

It may be served in an ornamented crust previously baked. 
If to be white, beat as many yolks of eggs as the quantity may 
require, and simmer in the ragout 2 minutes : it must not boil. 
Sometimes 1 or 2 whole pigeons, nicely prepared, form a part 
of this much-admired dish, which in one way or other is rarely 
omitted on well-covered tables. 

VEAL CAKE.—E. R. 
182. — ^Bone a breast of veal, and cut it in slices ; cut also 
slices of ham or lean bacon, and boil 6 eggs hard ; butter a 
dedp pan, and place the whole in layers one over the other, 
cutting the eggs in slices, and seasoning with cnopped herbs 
and cayenne pepper, and wetting the herbs with anchovy or 
other highly -flavoured sauce. Cover up the whole, let it bake 
for 4 hours, and, v\^hen taken from the oven, lay a weight upon 
it to press it well together. TVTien cold, turn it out. 

Another. — Boil 6 or 8 eggs hard ; cut the yolks in 2, and 



1G8 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XI. 

lay some of the pieces in the bottom of the pan : shake in a 
little chopped parsley, some slices of veal and ham, and then 
eggs again, shaking in, after each, some chopped parsley, with 
pepper and salt, till the pan is fidl. Then put in water enough 
to cover it, and lay on it about an ounce of butter ; tie it down 
with a double paper, and bake it about an hour. Then press 
it close together with a spoon, and let it stand till cold. It 
may be put into a small mould, and then it will turn out 
beautifully for a supper or side dish. 

Ajiother. — Chop very finely cold dressed veal and ham or 
bacon ; mix it with a slice of bread-crumb soaked in njilk, 2 
onions chopped and browned, a little salt, pepper, and an egg 
beaten. Put all these ingredients into a stewpan until they 
are hot and are well mixed ; then oil or butter a mould, j)ut in 
the v/hole, and bake it in an oven until it is brown* ; then take 
it out, and send it to table with fresh gravy. 

Veal rolls are cut from any cold joint, or prepared in the 
same manner from the raw meat. Cut thin slices, and spread 
on them a fine seasoning of a very few crumbs, a little chopped 
or scraped bacon, parsley and shalot, some fresh mushrooms 
stewed and minced, pepper, salt, and a small piece of pounded 
mace. This stufiing may either fill up the roll like a sausage, 
or be rolled with the meat. In either case, tie it up very tight, 
and stew very slowly in a gravy and a glass of sherry. Serve 
it when tender, after skimmmg it nicely. 

BLANQUETTES. 

183. — Melt a piece of butter the size of a walnut in a 
stewpan ; then put in a little thyme, parsley, or any herbs you 
like the flavour of, and a little onion, all chopped fine, with a 
pinch of flour. Brown the herbs ; add pepper and salt, with a 
clove or two. Then put in cold or undressed veal, cut in thin 
slices the size of haif-a-crown ; add gravy or broth ^ pint, 
or according to the quantity of meat you want to dress. It 
should not be too large a dish. Let it stew very gently over a 
stove ; if of dressed meat, 1 hour will be suflScient : add ^ a 
teacupful of cream, and stir it well together for a few minutes ; 
then take it up, and before you turn it out add 2 yolks of eggs 
well beaten. Give it a few shakes over the fire. It must not 
boil, or it will curdle. 

Or : — Cut rabbits, fowl, veal, or lobster in pieces, steep there 



VEAL. 16i) 

(except the veal and fish) in water for i an hour, changing 
the water. Put some butter in a stev/pan to melt, but do not 
let it fry ; put in the meat with a very little flour, and keep 
shaking it well ; pour in by degrees some broth made of white 
meat, add a bunch of parsley, an onion, salt, mace, and white 
pepper. Stew it well i of an hour before it is dished ; take 
out the parsley and onion, and add some raw parsley chopped, 
and the yolk of an egg and cream beaten together. You must 
never cease shaking the pan until the blanquette is put over 
the dish. 

Veal d la Chartreuse. — Line a copper mould with fat bacon, 
lay sliced carrots and turnips round the edges, then cover 
with a forcemeat, and put in a fricassee of veal or fowl. 
Cover the top of the mould with a paste, steam it an hour, and 
serve it turned out upon a dish. 

To marble F<?a^.— Boil tender, skin, and cut a dried neat's 
tongue in thin slices, and beat it as fine as possible, with 
■J lb. of butter and some mace pounded. Have ready some 
roasted fillet of veal, beaten with butter, and seasoned with 
white pepper and salt ; of this put a thick layer in a large 
potting-pot, then put in the tongue, in rough irregular lumps, 
not to touch each other ; fill up the pot with veal, and press it 
down quite close. Pour clarified butter thick over ; keep it in 
a dry cool place, and serve in thin slices, taking off the butter. 
Garnish with parsley. 

SCALLOPS OF COLD VEAL. 

184. — Mince the meat extremely small, and set it over the 
fire, with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pejiper and salt, and a 
little cream, for a few minutes ; then put it into the scallop- 
shells, and cover them with crumbs of bread, over which put 
some bits of butter, and brown them before the fire. 

Either veal or chicken looks and eats well prepared in this 
way, and lightly covered with crumbs of bread fried ; or these 
may be put on in little heaps. 

TO 3IINCE VEAL. 
185. — Mince cold roast veal ; put to it a very little lemon- 
peel shred,- a little grated nutmeg, some salt, and 4 or 5 
spoonfuls of either broth, milk, or water ; simmer these gently 
with the meatj but take care not to let it boil, and add a bit of 
butter rubbed in flour. Put sippets of thui toasted bread, cut 

I 



170 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XII. 

into a three-cornered shape, round the dish. Fried crumbs of 
oread lightly strewed over, or served in little heaps on the 
meat, are an improvement to the look and flavour. A little 
shred of shalot may occasionally be added. 

Or : — Stew a few small mushrooms in their own liquor and 
a bit of butter i of an hour ; mince them very small, and 
add them (with their liquor) to minced veal, with also a little 
pepper and salt, some cream, and a bit of butter rubbed in less 
than i- a teaspoonful of flour. Simmer 3 or 4 minutes, and 
serve on thin sippets of bread. 

The Turkish mode. — Take equal quantities of cold dressed 
veal, minced very fine, fat^ and crumbs of bread, and season it 
well ; add chopped onions, parsley, salt, and cayenne pepper ; 
"wet it with one or two eggs, according to the quantity, adding, 
if necessary, a little cold melted butter ; make the mixture 
into balls or egg-shapes, and roll them in as much boiled rice 
as they will take round them. Stew them for 1^ hour in good 
gravy, well seasoned, and serve them up in it. 

In all these modes, the addition may be made of sauce aux 
truffes, or any of the approved sauces ; and a squeeze of lemon 
"will in all cases be found to give a pleasing zest to their 
flavour. 

CURRY OF VEAL. 

186. — Cut part of abreast of veal in moderate-sized pieces; 
put it in a stewpan with an onion. and a shalot sliced fine, a 
slice of lemon, 1 oz. of butter, a little parsley and thyme, and 
a tablespoonful of curry -powder mixed with the same quantity 
of flour ; let the whole sweat together until the meat is slightly 
brown ; add sufficient broth or water for the sauce ; let it boil 
gently till the veal is done ; strain the sauce through a sieve, 
pour it over the veal quite hot, and serve with rice in a sepa- 
rate dish. 



CHAPTER XII. 

PORK. 

This meat requires to be very well roasted, is never boiled 
unless salted, and in every form should be thoroughly cooked. 
It is not the fashion to stuff it, as heretofore, with sage and 
onions, the meat frequently disagreeing with delicate persons 



Chap. XII. TORK. 171 

witliout the addition of so strong an adjunct, but it forms u 
very savoury addition. A part of the objection may be re- 
moved by boiling the sage and onions, and mixing them with 
bread-crumbs and a chopped apple ; and if thus prepared, the 
stuffing will be found mild, and of excellent flavour. 

The griskin and the sparerib are certainly improved bv 
being powdered with chopped sage, but this is all a matter of 
taste. The skin of the leg and loin must be scored previous 
to roasting ; but take care to preserve the skin, or cracJding^ 
of a fine brown, as many persons look upon it to be the best 
part of the pork : it should therefore be well basted, and 
guarded from being burned by a sheet of oiled paper. Send 
both up with a glass of vinegar mixed with 2 teaspoonfuls of 
made mustard in the dish. Apple-sauce should always be 
served with roasted pork. 

If you kill a young pig of 4 or 5 months, take off the skin 
of the fore quarter, roast it, and serve with mint-sauce and 
salad. 

SUCKING-PIGS. 

187. — To scald a Sucking-pig. — The moment the pig is 
killed put it into cold water for a few minutes ; then rub it 
over with a little resin, beaten extremely small, and put it 
into a pail of scalding water ^ a minute ; take it out, lay it on 
a. table, and pull off the hair as quickly as possible : if any 
part does not come oif, put it in again. When quite clean, 
wash it well with warm water, and then in 2 or 3 cold waters, 
that no flavour of the resin may remain. Take off" the feet at 
the first joint ; make a slit down the belly and take out the 
entrails : put the liver, heart, and lights to the feet. Wash 
the pig well in cold water, dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a 
wet cloth to keep it from the air. 

To roast a Sucking-pig . — Put some sage, a large piece of 
white bread, salt, pepper, and an onion, into the belly ; then 
sew it up. Observe to skewer the legs back, or the under 
part will not crisp. Lay it to a brisk fire till thoroughly dry ; 
then have ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig 
with it in every part. Dredge as much flour over it as will 
possibly lie, and do not touch it again till ready to serve ; then 
scrape off" the flour very carefully with a blunt knife or coarse 
towel, rub the pig well with a buttered cloth, and take off" the 
head whUe at the fire ; take out the brains, and mix therr with 

1 "i 



172 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XII, 

tlie gravy that comes from the pig, or make them up into 
balls with crumbs of bread and egg. Then take it up, and, 
without withdrawing the spit, cut it down the back and belly, 
lay it into the dish, and throw out the onion : chop the sage 
and bread quickly as fine as you can, and mix them with fine 
melted butter and thick brown gravy. Take off the upper 
part of the head down to the snout. Put the sauce into the 
dish after the pig has been split down the back, and garnished 
with the ears and the 2 jaw's. In Devonshire it is served 
whole, if very small ; the head only being cut off to garnish, 
as above. 

It will require from 2 horirs to 2^ to roast, and an iron 
" pig-plate " should be hung on a bar of the grate to prevent 
the middle of the pig being done before the other parts are 
ready. 

Suckmg-pig should never be more than about 3 weeks old ; 
but sometimes young j^orkers just weaned from the dam are 
roasted whole in the following manner : — 

TO ROAST A PORKER.— E. R. 

188. — "\Ylien prepared for the spit, roll a small lump of 
butter in flour and chopped sage-leaves, and put it in the in- 
side ; but put enough, as the body of a young pig should be 
quite filled with stuffing. When warm at the fire, take the 
whites of 1 or 2 eggs, beat them well, and, v»4th a small brush 
or a bunch of feathers, spread it all over the pig. When 
nearly roasted, catch the gravy that falls ; and, when taken 
from the spit, remove the sage-leaves from the inside ; cut off 
the head, split it, and take out the brains, cut the pig down 
the back and into quarters, cut off the ears, and \?ij them with 
the head round the dish. Mix with the gravy already caught 
the brains and the sage-leaves, chopped small, together with a 
little cream or melted butter heated in a saucepan, and pour 
it into the dish. 

The pig may be sent up with various sauces, — ^viz. currant- 
sauce, egg-sauce, gravy, and plumped prunes or raisins. This 
is an old-fashioned recipe for roasting-pig, but, as it obtained 
when the dish was a favourite, it has been inserted here. 
The common method now is, to bake a pig, and send it to the 
oven rubbed with butter, basting it occasionally with butter 
wrbile cooking, and having gravy, breads egg, cranberries, or 



Chap. XII. PORK. 173 

currant-jelly as an accompaniment. It will take more than 
2 hours in roasting ; or it may be equally well baked. 

To roast a Porker's Head. — Choose a fine head, not too 
close to the neck ; clean it well, remove the eyes and snout, 
and put bread and sage as for pig ; sew it up tight, and on a 
string, or hanging-jack, roast it as a pig, and serve with the 
same sauce. 

LEG OF PORK.—E. E. 

189. — To lake. — Rub it well over with salt and saltpetre 
mixed ; let it lie 5 or 6 days in the brine ; then hang it up to 
smoke for 5 or 6 days. Take off the skin, put it into an 
earthen dish, and pour a little red wine over it ; stick a few 
cloves in it, or beat them to powder, and rub them over it. 
"When it has been in the oven a short time, take some hard 
biscuit, pounded with sugar, and spread it all over. Sen-e it 
up with gravy, and port-wine sauce. 

To roast. — Choose a small leg of fine young pork ; raise the 
skin round the knuckle with a sharp knife, and fill tlie space 
with sage and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt, 
securing the skin tight with string to keep in the stuffing. 
Score the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than the outer 
rind. Put it at first a good distance from the fire, baste it 
frequently to prevent its scorching : when about three parts 
done, rub the skin rather firmly with raw butter, after Avhich 
flour it lightly and put close to the fire to crisp the crackling. 
Apple-sauce should be served with it. 

To boil. — Salt it 8 or 10 days, turning it daily, but do not 
rub it after the first. When it is to be dressed weigh it : let 
it lie i an hour in cold water to make it white : allow i of an 
hour for every lb., and i an hour over, from the time it boils 
up : skim it as soon as it boils, and frequently after, but do 
not boil it fast, or it will be hard. Allow water enough. 
Save some of the water to make pea-soup. Some boil it in a 
cloth, floured, which gives a very delicate look, but destroys 
the value of the liquor for making soup. 

PORK CUTLETS, 

190. — Perhaps few things of a simple nature, and served in 
a plain way, are better than a hot pork chop, cut about t an 
inch thick, trimmed neatly, and broiled upon the gridiron. 

Or : — Fry in salad oil ; serve with sauce Robert or gherkin- 



174 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. Xn. 

sauce, the gherkins being shred fine into some good thick 
brown gravy. 

Or : — Marinade the cutlets for 4 hours in oil with an onion 
in slices, parsley, bay-leaf, pepper, and salt ; fry them in the 
marinade ; serve with tomata-sauce. 

Or : — iMelt a small piece of butter in a fryingpan ; put in 

it 3 bay-leaves, 3 slices of lemon, a little parsley and thyme 

shred, 4 leaves of sage, a blade of mac€, 8 allspice, and a glass 

of white wine ; lay in the cutlets, put a cover over them, let 

them be about two-thirds done, then take them out, dry them, 

dip them in egg, then in bread-crumbs, fry them quickly; 

serve with the sauce that comes from the cutlets, thickened 

with flour and butter, and a little mustard stirred in at the last 

moment previous to sending to table, as if it boils it is apt to 

curdle. 

PORK CURRY. 

191 .■ — Take pork cutlets, cut rather fat, and proceed as for 

veal curry. 

SADDLE OF PORK. 

192. — Have a saddle of pork cut as a saddle of mutton ; 
roast it Avith the rind on. When sending it to table, remove the 
crackling, and serve with tomata-sauce. 

LOIN AND NECK OF PORK 

193. — Maybe roasted and served with the same accompani- 
ments as a porker. 

Or : — Simmer the best end of either of the joints till nearly 
fit for the table, strip off the skin, put it into a cradle-spit, wet 
it all over with yolks of eggs, and cover it thickly with crumbs 
of bread, sweet herbs and chives chopped fine for stuffing, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt. It will become a good brown 
in about ^ an hour. 

Either of them may also be trolled. — Bone it : put a force- 
meat of chopped sage, a very few crumbs of bread, salt, pep- 
per, and 2 or 3 berries of allspice, over the inside : then roll 
the meat as tight as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good 
distance at first from the fire. 

To parboil it before the herbs are put on will be an improve- 
ment. 

LOIN OF PORK A LA PORTUGAISE. 

1 94. — In Portugal, where the pork is perhaps the finest in 



Chap. XII. POEK. 175 

Europe, porkers are never killed, but the fat of bacon-hogs 
is cut off for curing ; and the loin, eaten fresh, is there pre- 
pared by being left for some days to soak in red wine and 
garlic, it being occasionally hung up to dry, then returned to 
the wine, afterwards roasted, and served with tomata-sauce. 
It is a highly-flavoured delicacy, and we offer it as a hint wliich 
is worthy of attention. 

A r Espagnole — is prepared and dressed in the same manner ; 
but when ready for dressing, sprinkle the meat with sweet herbs 
chopped, wrap it in bay--leaves, add the juice of two Seville 
oranges to the \\ane, which must be strained, and bake it in an 
oven. 

PIGS-FEET A LA ST. MENEHOULD.—E. R. 

195. — Clean the feet perfectly, cut them down in two, then 
bind them with a tape to prevent their shrinking or opening, 
and boil them gently until they are rather soft, with carrots, 
onions, parsley, thyme, allspice, and bay -leaf ; let them cool 
in the liquor. When required for use, take off the tape, dip 
them in yolks of eggs and butter about three parts melted : 
season them, then cover them with crumbs of bread and 
finely-minced parsley, "wdth the smallest quantity of shalot. 
Broil them until highly browned, and serve dry, or with sauce 
Robert. 

Pettitoes. — Boil them, with the liver and the heart, in a small 
quantity of water very gently ; then cut the meat fine, and 
simmer it with a little of the v>^ater and the feet split, till the 
feet are quite tender ; thicken with a bit of butter, a little flour, 
a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper. Give it a 
boil up, pour it over a few sippets of bread, and put the feet 
on the mince. 

TO FORCE HOG'S EARS. 
196. — Parboil 2 pair of ears, or take some that have been 
soused ; make a forcemeat of an anchovy, a little finely-minced 
veal, some sage, parsley, i lb. of suet chopped, 1 lb. of bread- 
crumbs, pepper, and only a little salt. iMix all these with 
the yolks of 2 eggs, raise the skin of the upper side of the 
ears, and stuff them with the above. Fry the ears in fresh 
butter, of a fine colour ; then poiu- away the fat, and drain 
them ; make ready J pint of rich gravy, with a glass of sherry ; 
3 teaspoonfuls of made mustard, a little bit of flour and 



179 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIL 

butter, a small onion whole, and a little pepper or cayenne. 
Put these, with the ears, iato a stewpan, and cover it close ; 
stew it gently for ^ an hour, shaking the pan often. When 
done enough, take out the onion, place the ears carefully in a 
dish, and pour the sauce over them. If a larger dish be wanted, 
the meat from 2 feet may be taken from the bones, and added 
to the above. 

PIG^ FEET AND EARS. 

197. — Soiised. — Clean carefully and soak them some hours, 
then boil them tender : having prepared a pickle of some of the 
liquor that they were boiled in, and a quarter part of vinegar 
and salt, boiled, pour it over them cold. When they are to be 
dressed, dry them, cut the feet in two, slice the ears, and fry 
them. Serve with butter, mustard, and vinegar, in a boat. 
They may be dipped in batter, or only floured. 

Fricasseed. — Take feet and ears that have been boiled, but 
not kept in pickle wherein was vinegar ; boil them tender in 
milk, cut the feet into neat bits, and the ears into strips of -k 
inch wide : wipe them, and simmer in veal broth, with a bit 
of onion, mace, and lemon-peel. Before you serve, add a little 
cream, flour, and butter. 

Jelly of Pigs' Feet and Ears. — Clean and prepare, then 
boil them in a very small quantity of water till every bone can 
be taken out ; throw in half a handful of chopped sage, the 
same of parsley, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and a little 
jnace in fine powder ; simmer till the herbs are scalded, then 
pour the whole into a melon-form. Serve when cold. 

PORK GRISKIN 

198. — Is usually very hard : the best v^ay to prevent this is 
to put it into as much cold water as will cover it, and let it 
boil up ; then instantly take it off", and put it into a Dutch 
oven ; a very few minutes will do it. Eemember to rub butter 
over it, and then flour it, before you put it to the fire. Lay 
it in a dish on melted butter and mustard. It should be sea- 
soned with pepper and salt before roasting. 

SPARERIB 

199. — Should be basted with a very little butter and a little 
fiour, and then sprinkled with dried sage crumbled. Serve 
apple-sauce in a boat. . 



Chap. XII. PORK. 177 

BELLY OF PORK. 

200. — Lovers of pork are very fond of having the belly part 
of a porker, either fresh or salted, strewed thickly over the in- 
side with sage, sweet herbs, minced eschalots, and seasoning ; 
then rolled, tied tightly together, and either baked or roasted. 
It eats well cold and pressed. 

SHOULDERS AND BREASTS OF PORK. 

201. — Put them into pickle, or salt the shoulder as a ham , 
cut accordingly. When very delicate, they may be roasted. 

SPRING, OR FOREHAND OF PORK. 

202. — Cut out the bone ; sprinkle salt, pepper, and sage 
dried, over the inside ; warm a little butter to baste it ; roll 
the pork tight, tie it, and flour it ; roast by a hanging-jack. 
About 2 hours will do it. 

CHINE OF PORK 

203. — The chine is usually salted, and served as an accon? 
paniment to roast turkey. Garnish the dish with greens cut 
in halves, and carrots of nearly the same size, to make u 
border round the chine. 

Or : — Salt the chine for 3 days, roast it, and serve it up 
with sauce made thus : — Fry in oil or butter 2 or 3 sliced 
onions until they take colour ; then pour off the oil, and add 
some gravy-sauce, chopped mushrooms, and 2 tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar, with 1 teaspoonful of made mustard. Give the 
whole a boil, and serve it up in the dish. 

BLADE-BONE OF PORK 
204. — Is taken from the bacon-hog : the less meat left on it, 
in moderation, the better. It is to be broiled ; and when just 
done, pepper and salt it. Put to it a piece of butter and a 
teaspoonful of mustard ; and serve it quickly. This is a 
Somersetshire dish. 

PIG'S HARSLET. 
205. — Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fat and 
lean bits of pork, beating the latter with a rolling-pin to make 
it tender ; season with pepper, salt, sage, and a little onion 
shred fine ; when mixed, put all into a caul, and fasten it up 
tight with Si needle and thread. Eoast it on a hanging-jack, 
or by a string. 

I .3 



178 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XII. 

Or : — Serve in slices, with parsley for a fry ; with a sauce 

of port wine and water, and mustard, just boiled up, and put 

into the dish. 

HOG'S LARD 

206. — Should be carefully melted in ajar put into a kettle 
of water and boiled : run it into bladders that have been ex- 
tremely well cleaned. The smaller they are the better the 
lard keeps, as, after the air reaches it, it becomes rank. Put 
in a sprig of rosemary when melting. 

This being a most useful article for frying fish, it should be 

])repared with care. ]Mixed with butter, it makes fine crust 

for tarts. 

HA3IS. 

207. — Skimmed milk, or milk and water, will be found pre- 
ferable to plain water for soaking hams ; and they may also 
be boiled in milk and water. 

"V^iere vegetables are plentiful, it is desirable to boil ham 
with 3 heads of celery, a couple of turnips, half a dozen small 
onions, and a large bunch of sweet marjoram, thyme, &c,, put 
in after the pot has been skimmed. " These will extract the 
salt and soften the meat. A piece of coarse fresh beef, or an}'^ 
kind of meat, in addition, will materially improve the ham, as, 
in this manner of boiling it, the juices of the meat and vege- 
tables insinuate themselves between the fibres of the ham, 
after having dislodged the salt, by which means the meat is 
enriched and rendered tender. At first sight this will appear 
an extravagant way of boiling a ham, but it should be consi- 
dered that the broth will serve the purposes of the family." ** 
If the meat and vegetables are not approved, 2 lbs. of fresh 
beef-dripping will answer nearly as well. 

A quart of ale added to the roots is a great assistance to a 
new ham. 

To boil. — If long hung, soak it for 24 hours in luke-warm 
water, changing it frequently. Wash and brush it well ; 
trim off any rusty parts ; put it into a boiler of water, and 
let it simmer from 3^ hours to 5 hours, according to its size. 
It is best to allow time enough, as it is easy to take up the 
ham when done, and keep it hot, covered closely over boiling 
water. Remove the skin carefully, and trim the ham of a neat 

^ ' iledical Commentarr oa Modem Cookery,' by A. Hunter, M.D.,

Chap. XII. POEK. 179 

shape ; dry the fat with a cloth, and either glaze it or sprinkle 
it with bread-crumbs previously browned -in the frj-ing-pan or 
bakers' raspings. Garnish the dish with stewed spinach or 
broad beans. A flower or two cut out of turnip or carrot is 
sometimes placed on the top. 

There can be no doubt that the foregoing is an excellent 
mode of boiling a ham, but many people prefer to have it 
baked, in which case send it to the oven in a deep pan with 
^ lb. of suet over it to baste it occasionally ; or skin it, 
cover it with a crust of coarse paste, and, when taken from 
the oven, strip off the crust, rub it with yolk of egg, on which 
put finely powdered crumbs of bread strewed with a dredging- 
box, in the same manner as when the ham is boiled. 

In Spain and Portugal, where the hams are generally fine, 
the method of dressing them is to put the ham in cold water 
v/ith a large handful of brown sugar, to which some persons 
add a quantity of the common country wine, and let it simmer 
on the fire until parboiled, keeping the pot well skimmed ; 
when taken out, the skin is stripped off, and the ham covered 
with brown sugar to the thickness of an inch, after which it 
is sent to the oven and baked until thoroughly done. 

A ham of 15 lbs. should be allowed nearly 2 hours before 
the water begins to boil, and as much more for simmering 
until half done ; then from 3 to 4 hours' baking, according to 
the heat of the oven, which however should never be allowed 
to be too hot. 

When cold, twist some neatly fringed letter-paper round 
the shank-bone. 

To roast. — Take a very fine ham (a Westphalia, if you 
can procure it), soak it in luke-warm water for a day or two, 
changing the water frequently. The day before you intend 
to cook it, take the ham out of the water, and, having re- 
moved the skin, trim it nicely, and pour over it a bottle of 
an inferior white wine ; let it steep till next morning, fre- 
quently during the day washing the wine over it ; put it in a 
cradle-spit in time to allow at least 6 hours for slowly roasting 
it ; baste continually with hot water. When it is done, dredge 
it all over with fine bread-raspings, shaken on through the top 
of the dredging-box, and set it before the fire to brown. 

For Gravy. — Take the wine in w^hich the ham was steeped, 
and add to it the essence or juice which flowed from the meat 



180 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIII. 

when taken from the spit ; squeeze in the juice of 2 lemons, 
put it into a saucepan, and boil and skim it ; send it to tabk. 
in a boat. Cover the shank of the ham (which should have 
been sawed short) with bunches of double parsley, and orna- 
ment it with any garnish you may think proper. 

To boil Mutton Ham. — Put it on the fire in cold water, let 
it warm quickly, and allow it to boil only 20 minutes ; then 
leave it in the pan of water till cold. This plan renders it 
moist, and answers when it is to be eaten cold. 



CHAPTER XIII. 
POULTRY AND GAME. 

POULTRY. 

A VEKY quick and clear fire is necessary for roasting all 
poultry. A large fowl will take t of an hour, a middling one 
4- an hour, and a small one 20 minutes. Care must be taken 
that they are well and thoroughly done. A small turkey will 
take 1+ hour, turkey-poults only I hour, a goose 1 hour, 
larger turkeys and geese 1^ hour : both should have the 
breasts papered. Chickens take ^ an hour ; pigeons 20 
minutes, and may be dressed as soon as killed. Ducks and 
ducklings the same as fowls and chickens, but all must vary 
in proportion to their difference of size, the temperature of the 
air, and the state of the fire ; and the cook must acquire cor- 
rectness by experience. 

The French adopt the following method to make old poultry 
cat tender : — Let the bird soak in cold water for 24 hours, 
with a handful or two of wood-ashes ; pick off the feathers, 
and let it hang for another 24 hours ; truss it, and let it boil 
for i of an hour in a little veal-broth ; take it out, lard, and 
roast it ; when nearly done, baste it with very hot butter. By 
observing these directions, you will impart to an old bird all 
the delicate flavour of a young chicken. 

In drawing poultry the cook must be careful not to crack 
*iie gall-bladder, for then no washing will remove the bitter 
ness. Ignorant cooks sometimes draw fowls by cutting a hole 



CiiAP. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 181 

ill their side, but it should be done through the ve?it, and, that 
being cut off, a string should fasten the rump close to the from 
part. 

TURKEY.— E. R. 

208. — There is a quaint adage that says, — • 

" Turkey roast is turkey lost ; 
Turkey boiled is turkey spoiled ; 
But turkey braised is turkey praised." 

To roast. — Make a veal stuffing ; fill the breast where the 
crop is taken from to make the bird look handsome ; jDaper 
the breast, and roast at a distance from a quick fire. 

Or : — Take about 2 lbs. of truffles, peel them, select the 
small ones, and, after chopping, pound them in a mortar with 
an equal quantity of the fat of bacon rasped ; make the 
stuffing with this, mixed with some of the larger truffles 
whole, put them into the body of the turkey, and let it hang 
for several days ; then roast it with a piece of fat bacon laid 
over the breast and a paper over that. Truffles of a good 
quality are, however, so very expensive, that turkeys fattened 
in France and stuffed with them have been sold in London at 
Christmas for 5 guineas each ! Mushrooms are therefore more 
commonly used, and even chestnuts may be substituted for 
truffles, pounded and mixed with bacon in the same manner ; 
the chestnuts should be boiled to take off the husk, peeled 
nicely, and pounded. Chestnuts, put whole into the body of 
a turkey and hung for some days, improve the flavour ; but a 
turkey thus stuffed will require long and careful roasting, and 
must be put at first at a distance from the fire. A stuffing of 
sausage or other meat m.ay be put into the crop besides. 
When the turkey is done, remove the paper; sprinkle with 
salt ; dredge on a little flour, and froth it well with some fresh 
butter ; serve with a good gravy, and fried sausages round, or 
chestnut-sauce. It is an invariable practice to serve salt meat 
of some kind with roast turkey ; either ham, tongue, bacon, 
or salt chine ; tlie latter principally at Christmas. 

Turkey with Sausage-meat. — At the messes of European 
regiments in India, it is no uncommon thing to bone a turkey 
and a fowl, and put one inside the other, filling the interstices 
with sausage-meat, a small pig being killed for the purpose. 
A turkey thus prepared will take a long time roasting, and 
must be placed at a great distance from the fire at first. 



182 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XIII. 

"VYhen carved the slices should be cut quite through ; and 
epicures aver that it is one of the finest dishes that come to 
table. 

Boiled Turkey. — Fill the body with oysters, and let it 
boil by steam without any water. When sufficiently done, 
take it up ; strain the gra\y that will be found in the pan ; 
thicken it with a little flour and butter, add the liquor of the 
oysters intended for sauce, also stewed, and warm the oysters 
up in it ; whiten it with a little boiled cream, and pour it over 
the turkey. 

A la Braise. — Take out the breastbone of the turkey ; fill 
it with sausage-meat ; lard the breast, braise it, and serve with 
celery, oyster, or chestnut sauce. 

Observe : — A small hen-bird boils better than a cock, and the best 
mode is to roast the cock-turkey and boil the hen. 

Turkey pulled and grilled is a mode of preparing the re- 
mains of cold turkey by mincing the white meat and fricassee- 
ing it with white sauce ; the legs being scored, peppered, and 
salted, broiled, and sent up over the mince. 

Or devilled: — On the rump, gizzard, and a drum-stick, put 
salt, pepper, and cayenne. Let them be broiled, and brought 
to table as hot as possible ; cut them in small pieces, pour over 
them a ladle of mustard, ditto of melted butter, a spoonful of 
soy, ditto of lemon-juice, and some of the gravy out of tlie 
dish ; mix quickly and hand round. It forms an admirable 
relish ; fowls may be treated in the same manner. 

CAPON, OR POULARDE, 

209. — Should be stuffed and roasted, or otherwise dressed, in 
precisely the same manner as turkey. They are the male and 
female of the common fowl, but, when caponed, grow nearly 
to the size of turkeys. 

A la Provengale. — Half roast the fowl ; cut it in pieces ; 
take a dozen onions, cut them in rings, add a little parsley 
chopped. Place them in a stewpan, laying a bed of onions 
and parsley, then fowl, till the whole are used : add a glass of 
oil or cream with 1 or 2 bay -leaves and salt ; let them simmer 
slowly ; dish the fowl, put the onions in the middle, add a 
little sauce, and send it to table. 



Chap. 'Kill. POULTEY AND GAME. 183 

POELE TO BOIL FOWLS IN. 

210. — Take 2 lbs. of veal and 2 lbs. of bacon ; cut both into 
large dice ; cut also 2 large carrots and 2 onions into dice ; put 
them, with a pound of butter, into a stewpan, the juice of 4 
lemons, a little thyme or sweet fennel, and 2 laurel-leaves 
bruised ; season it with salt and pepper ; put them on a good 
fire ; add a spoonful of boiling broth, and boil it. 

FO WLS.—E. R. 

Great care must always be taken to pick out every feather 
and plug from poultry and game before it is dressed. 

211. — Isolds for boilifig, vfhen trussed and singed, should 
soak an hour or two in skimmed milk. Tie them in a cloth ; 
put them in cold water, and set them over a slow fire ; cover 
the saucepan close, and let them simmer ; as soon as the scum 
rises, remove it carefully, cover them close up again, and boil 
them gently 20 minutes ; take them off the fire, and the steam, 
if kept in, will sufhciently finish them. It will much improve 
the appearance of boiled fowls if they are dressed with a thin 
piece of puff-paste tied over the breast. 

Or : — Hang young fowls a night ; take the livers, hearts, 
and tenderest parts of the gizzards — the last being previously 
boiled — shred very small, with half a handful of young clarj^, 
an anchovy to each fowl, an onion, and the yolks of 4 eggs 
boiled hard, with pepper, salt, and mace to your taste. Stuff 
the fowls with this, and sew up the vents and necks quite 
close, that the water may not get in. Boil them in salt and 
water till almost done ; then drain them, and put them into a 
stewpan with butter enough to brown them. Serve with a good 
deal of melted butter, with either soy or ketchup in it. 

To roast. — Put into the inside a piece of butter the size of 
a hazel-nut or walnut, according as the fowl is large or small ; 
make the butter black with pepper, and sprinkle a little salt 
upon it. This will greatly improve the taste of the fowl, 
rendering the whole more juicy, and particularly the back and 
side bones, wliich are so apt to be dry. 

Or : — Bone and draw inwards the leg and pinion of the 
wing. Stuff with sausage-meat, and tie the neck and vent. 
Roast, and serve with gravy in the dish, and bread-sauce in a 
tureen. 

A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuffed in the 



184 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIIX. 

crop with sausage-meat ; and served with gravy in the dish, 
and with bread-sauce. 

'"^ Hoiled ivith Oysters. — Take a young fowl, fill the inside 
with oysters, put it into a jar, and plunge the jar in a kettle 
or saucepan of vv^ater. Boil it for 1^ hour. There will be a 
quantity of gravy from the juices of the fovv'l and oysters in the 
jar ; make it into a white sauce, with the addition of egg, 
cream, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters to it, or serve 
it up plain with the fowl. The gravy that comes from a fowl 
dressed in this manner will be a stiff jelly the next day ; the 
fowl will be very white and tender, and of an exceedingly fine 
flavour — advantages not attainable in ordinary boiling — while 
the dish loses nothing of its delicacy and simplicity. 

With Rice. — The fowl should be stewed very slowly in some 
clear veal broth, well skimmed, and seasoned with pepper, salt, 
mace, and an onion. About ^ an hour before it is ready add 
i pint of rice, well washed and soaked ; simmer until tender, 
then strain the rice from the broth and lay it on a sieve before 
the fire to sv/ell ; strain the gravy, thicken with a little flour 
and butter, and whiten with a little cream ; disli the fowl witli 
the rice round it, and pour the sauce over the whole. 

White- sauce is the most fashionable accompaniment, the old 
method of dishing with parsley and butter being on the decline : 
but as parsley still maintains its ground with many people, it 
is advisable to boil a sufficient quantity ; press and chop it, 
garnishing the dish with small mounds thus prepared, which 
may be mixed at table v/ith the white sauce by the guests who 
like the flavour of parsley. Liver-sauce is sometimes served 
with boiled fowls, but celery or oyster sauce, either made 
separate or together, is preferable. 

Poularde a la Royale. — Bone the fowl, and stuff it with 
sweetbread, liver, and mushrooms well seasoned and made into 
a ragout. Sew up the fowl ; cover it with thin slices of lard 
or bacon, and either tie paper over it and roast it, or put it to 
braise ; if roasted, take off" the lard and paper before serving, 
to brown it. Send it up on a puree of chestnuts. A turkey- 
poult may be dressed the same way. 

To braise. — Bone the breast, and fill it with forcemeat. 
Lay the bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew- 
pan, and the fowl on them. Put to them an onion, a faggot 



Chap. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 18o 

of herbs, 3 blades of mace, a pint of stock, and a glass or two 
of sherry. Cover the fowl Avith slices of bacon, and then with 
white paper : cover the whole close, and put it on a slow stove 
for 1 hour. Then take it up, strain the braise, and skim off 
the fat carefully ; set it on to boil very quickly to a glaze, 
and put it over the fowl with a brush. Serve with a brown 
fricassee of mushrooms. Before glazing, put the fowl into an 
oven for a few minutes, to give a little colour. 

Fowl mix Onions. — Boil 12 small onions in several waters, 
until the strength is out and they are tender ; cut a piece of 
boiled pickled pork into dice ; take a tablespoonful of hot 
vinegar, some sweet herbs chopped, and the yolk of an ^^'g 
beaten ; make this quite thick with herbs, mix it with the pork 
and onions, and then stuif the inside of the fowl with it ; braise 
the fowl in a little broth and butter, and serve with white 
sauce. 

Aux Poix. — Put some butter into a stewpan, add flour 
until it is rather stiff, then put in some small pieces of bacon ; 
let it brown a little, then cut up the fowl and put it in : 
moisten with gravy, mix it well, and season with parsley, sorrel, 
young onions, -^ a bay-leaf, and a clove, and let it boil. Put 
in the peas over a quick fire, skim, and when done enough pour 
the sauce over the fowl. 

Potdet Blanc. — Choose a good, tender, fat fowl ; melt 
\ lb. butter in a stewpan, turn the fowl in for a minute 
or two, mix 2 tablespoonfuls of flour into the butter very 
smoothly, taking care it does not brown. Put in the fowl, and 
nearly cover it with a weak veal broth ; add small onions, a 
bimch of sweet herbs, and a few sprigs of parsley, with some 
fresh mushrooms and a teaspoonful of lemon-juice. Let it 
simmer H hour, or, if the fowl is large, 2 hours. Before 
serving take out the fowl, and keep it hot whilst the gravy is 
prepared. Strain it, and mix with it the yolk of an egg well 
beaten, stirring it all the time, till it thickens, but do not let it 
boil ; pour it over the fowl, and garnish with slices of lemon. 

Fried. — Cut up a fowl, and put it into an earthen dish with 
slices of onion, parsley, sorrel, salt, and pepper, and the juice 
of 2 or 3 lemons ; leave it an hour or two to absorb the juice. 
Put in the legs first, then the breast, wings, &c. ; dry the joints 
in a cloth, dip them in batter, fry them of a fine colour : serve 



186 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIIL 

them up with fried eggs, and a sauce piquante. The batter is 
to be made with eggs and a spoonful of oil. 

Or : — The remains of a cold fowl may be used for this pur- 
pose : it will of course not take so much time to dress. Place 
it round a dish, and fill up the centre with tomata, sorrel, 
or other sauce, made very hot and very acid. 

E?i Cotelettes. — Cut up a fowl and bone it, make the legs, 
wings, breast, and merrythought into 6 fine cutlets by flattening 
them and giving them a good shape ; then take the meat from 
the remainder of the fowl, pound it in a mortar with pepper, 
salt, and a spoonful of gravy, brush the cutlets with an e^g, 
lay on the forcemeat, dredge fried crumbs on the tops, and try 
them a light brov/n : serve them up with gravy in the dish, or 
dry, with a lemon squeezed over them. 

TO BROIL A FOWL.—E. R. 

2 12. — Split the fowl down the back ; season it very well with 
pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the inner part next the 
fire, which must be very clear. Hold the gridiron at a con- 
siderable distance from the fire, and allow the fowl to remain 
until it is nearly half done ; then turn it, taking great care that 
it does not burn. Droil it of a fine brown, and serve it up with 
stewed mushrooms or a sauce with pickled mushrooms. A 
duck may be broiled in the same way. If the fowl is very 
large, half-roast it, then cut it into 4 quarters and finish it on 
the gridiron. 

FRICASSEE OF FO WL.~E. R. 

213. — Put the fowl into a jar, with sliced onion, parsley, 
salt, and a piece of butter rolled in flour ; let it remain in a 
kettle of water on the fire until three parts done, then skim 
and strain the liquor, and after draining wipe the fowl dry. 
Put it into a stewpan with a piece of butter and a slice or two 
of ham, throw in a little flour, and shake it until it is of a good 
colour. Moisten with the liquor taken out of the jar, adding 
parsley, young onions, a bay-leaf, a clove, sorrel, and mush- 
rooms cut into pieces : skim it, and let it stew until done, then 
take out the herbs, and thicken the sauce with a little cream, 
but do not let it boil : finish with a little lemon-juice, and pour 
the sauce over all. 

Or :— Eather more than half-boil a fowl in a small quantity 
of water ; when cool, cut it up, and put it to simmer in a 
little gravy made of the liquor it is boiled in, and a bit ot 



Chap. XIII. POULTllY AKD GAME. 187 

veal or mutton, onion, mace, and lemon-peel, some white 
pepper, and a bmich of sweet herbs. When quite tender, 
keep it hot while you thicken the sauce in the following 
manner : strain it off, and put it back into the .saucepan with 
a little salt, a scrape of nutmeg, and a bit of flour and butter ; 
give it one boil ; and when you are going to serve, beat up the 
yolk of an egg and i pint of cream, and stir them over the 
iire, but do not let them boil. The sauce will be quite as 
good without the egg. 

Or : — Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the bone of a 
cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can : dredge it with flour, 
and fry it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the butter from 
it ; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well seasoned, 
and thickened v/ith a little flour and butter. Add the juice of 
^ a lemon. 

The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of the 
necks, feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers ; which are 
called the trimmings of the fowls. 

See also Fricassee of Chicken. 

BISSOLES. 

214. — Pick from the bones and skin any kind of cold poultry ; 
weigh it, and add one-third of grated bread-crumbs, a little 
cold melted butter, a small onion, previously boiled and finely 
minced, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs to bind it toge- 
ther. Roll out, thin, some trimmings of puff-paste ; cut it in 
2-inch square pieces ; put in the middle of each a teaspoonful 
of the mince, fold the paste over it, and shape it -with a cutter. 
Egg the shapes, dip them in bread-crumbs, and fry them in 
lard : serve dry, garnish with fried parsley, and take care that 
the edges be perfectly closed. 

Or : — Pound any kind of cold meat, thicken a little good 
gravy with cream or butter, season the meat, and m^ix it with the 
sauce, until it is well moistened ; then roll out some paste into 
oval pieces, lay a large tablespoonful of the meat on one end, 
double it over, press the edges together, and scallop them ; 
brush the paste over with }t>lk of egg, sprinkle vermicelli upon 
it, and fry them.

Viith. fried bread, or paste cut in shapes. It may also be served 1 

up in a casserole, or wall of rice or mashed potatoes, or with | 

poached eggs. j 

Souffle, de Puree de Volaille. — Make the puree as above ' 
directed, only much thicker, adding 2 oz. of butter ; stir it 

well over the fire, and when warm add the yolks and the \ 

Avliites of 4 or 6 eggs, according to the quantity of meat, well \ 

beaten, separately : mix the whole lightly together, then put ] 

it into a dish, and let it remain in the oven until it is firm. 1 

If put warm into the oven it will be ready i hour sooner. I 

These dishes may be made of cold fillet of veal. i 

CURRY OF CHICKEN. \ 

216. — Cut up a rav/ chicken ; put it into a stewpan, with ^ 
2 oz. of butter, ^ a large onion sliced thin, a few sprigs of , 
parsley and thyme, and 2 oz. of lean ham : let the whole '• 
sweat over the fire for a few minutes ; add a heaped table- 
spoonful of curry powder, and a small one of flour ; shake the i 
whole together for 5 minutes over the fire ; put to it a pint of j 
either gravy or v/ater ; let the whole simmer gently until the ; 
cliicken is done ; take out the chicken, rub the sauce through } 
a sieve, boil it up, skim, put in the chicken, season with i 
salt and lemon-juice. Plain boiled rice to be served in a : 
separate dish. ! 
DUM^OKHT.^—E. R. \ 
217. — Clean and truss a fowl, or rabbit, as for roasting; ! 
then stufi* it with sultana raisins, pistachio-nuts, and boiled i 
rice in equal parts. Beat fine 1 oz. of coriander-seed, freed 
from the husks, 4 onions, a dozen peppercorns, 6 cloves, and a ' 
teaspoonful of pounded ginger. Set 12 oz. of butter in a stew- i 
pan over the fire, rub the pounded ingredients over the fowl \ 
or rabbit, and let it fry until perfectly well browned and ; 
tender. Have boiled in a quart of white broth 12 oz. of rice, ^ 
2 oz. of sultana raisins, 2 oz. of pistachio-nuts, and 2 of , 

i 
* The dish, mentioned in the Arabian Nights as the kid stuffed with 

pistachio-nuta, ' 



Chap. XIII. POULTEY AND GAME. IS9 

almonds, the two latter blanched, and cut into thin slices. 
When the rice is nearly tender, strain off the broth, and add 
the rice to the fried fowl ; stir the whole well, that the butter 
may completely saturate the rice, and keep it near the fire to 
swell till wanted. In serving sun-ound the fowl with the rice. 
Observe that, in pounding the onions, the juice only is used 
mth the spices, or they must be rubbed and pounded so finely 
as not to he perceptible. Chestnuts may be substituted for 
pistachio-nuts. 

CHICKENS.— E. R. 

218. — To boil, chickens should he jplump, and very nicely 
boiled ; if wanted to be particularly good, they must be boiled 
in a hlanc. It is the fashion to send them up with tufts of 
cauliflower or white brocoli, divested of stem and leaves, and 
v/hite sauce. Many people, however, prefer the stem to the 
flower, and have it sent up separately, sliced and covered 
with white sauce. 

A la Carmelite. — Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut 
into a stewpan ; as it melts dredge in flour, and when the 
whole is well mixed add a teacupful of milk. Cut up the 
chickens and put them in, adding peppercorns, an onion, and 
a blade of mace. Stew them until tender, adding milk and 
water if too dry. Take out the chickens ; have some parsley 
ready boiled and chopped ; mix it with lemon-juice and a 
little white pepper ; lay it upon the chickens, strain and 
thicken the sauce, add a glass of white wine, and send it to 
table garnished with chopped parsley and lemon or pickles. 

To pull Chickens. — Cut off the legs and the whole back of 
a dressed chicken, if underdone tjie better. Pull all the white 
part into little flakes free from skin, toss it up with a little 
cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with flour, \ a 
blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt, and a squeeze of 
lemon. Cut off the neck end of the chicken, and broil the 
back and side bones in one piece, and the two legs seasoned. 
Put the hash in the middle, with the back on it, and the two 
legs at the end. 

Another luay. — Take off the skin, and pull the flesh off the 
bone of a cold fowl in as large pieces as you can ; dredge it 
with flour, and fry it to a nice brown in butter. Drain the 
butter from it, and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy, well 



190 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIIL 

seasoned, and thickened with a little flour and butter. Add 
the juice of half a lemon. 

To fricassee Chickens. — Cut the chickens up very nice!}', 
and lay them into cold water. Then put them into a stew- 
pan with a piece of butter, the legs first, as they require more 
time than tlie other joints ; dredge them very lightly v/ith 
Hour as they stew, and moisten with a little broth ; add whole 
white pepper, a faggot of parsley and thyme, and an onion. 
Let them stew in this way for about -J- an hour ; take off the 
butter and scum : reduce the sauce made from the bones, and 
thicken it with cream and the yolk of an eg^, and send it to 
table ; a little lemon-juice will be necessary, and a few mush- 
rooms are a great improvement. Another side-dish may be 
made of the legs boned and filleted, and fried in batter. In 
filleting take out the bone, skin, sinews, &c. ; make a nice 
forcemeat ; stuff" and roll the fillets round. 4 legs will make 
8 pieces, whl(;h will be sufficient for a small dish, and these 
may be augmented by small pieces of fried paste cut into 
crescents, cockscombs, or other shapes. They must be served 
with a puree of some kind in the centre. 

To stew Chickens iji haste. — Take fresh-killed chickens, 
clean, cut them in pieces, and scald them in hot water, without 
giving them time to cool : fry them in butter with sweet herbs 
chopped, white pepper, and salt, then add some boiling water 
and flour ; stew them until the sauce is reduced : strain, and 
add to the sauce a tablespoonful of cream, the yolk of an egg 
beaten, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the chickens, and serve 
them up. This dish will be useful when it is requisite to add 
10 the dinner at a short notice ; and if the chickens do not grow 
cool, they will be tender. 

BLANC TO BOIL CHICKENS IN. 

219. — Cut a lb. of veal and the same quantity of fat bacon 
into small pieces, and lay them in a stewpan with i lb. of 
butter ; do not allow them to brown, but while the meat is 
white pour on boiling water, adding at the same time a 
clove, i a bay-leaf, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a little 
shalot. When sufficiently stewed strain it through a hair-sieve 
over the fowl, which must simmer in it for f of an hour. The 
veal and bacon that have been employed in this hlaiic may 
be put into a mortar and pounded together for some kind of 



Chap. XIII. POULTKY AND GAME. 191 

stuffing. It is the fashion to lard the breasts of boiled fowls 
with tongue. 

TO A D-IN-A-HOLE 

220. — May be thought a very humble dish, but if well 
dressed is very good. Make a common batter of eggs, flour, 
and milk, but rather thicker than usual, and put in the centre 
of it a fowl boned and stuffed with forcemeat ; let it be entirely 
covered with the batter, then bake it. 2 lbs. of beef, or an)'- 
kind of meat, may be seasoned and dressed in the same 
manner. 

GOOSE. 

221. — Scald 4 or 6 sage-leaves, according as they are fresh 
or dry, the fresh ones being the strongest ; chop them fine ; 
take 1 large or 2 small onions, chop them, and then pour 
boiling water over them to make them eat mild ; mix the sage 
and onion with rather more than an equal quantity of fine 
bread-crumbs : season well with pepper and salt ; put this in- 
side the body of the goose ; roast before a quick fire an hour 
or more, according to the size of the bird. In Ireland geese 
are sometimes stuffed wdth potatoes, the whole body being 
filled with them either w^hole or mashed ; but it absorbs 
so much of the gravy as to injure the richness of the bird. 
Apple-sauce and gravy are sent up with geese in separate 
tureens. 

Green Geese are roasted without any stuffing, being merely 
peppered on the inside. A lemon squeezed over a duck or a 
goose is a great improvement. 

TO STEW GIBLETS. 

222. — Have a set of giblets cleaned ; cut them in pieces of 
moderate size ; put them in a stewpan with an onion, a faggot 
of parsley and thyme, 3 or 4 leaves of sage, a fcAv allspice, 
some pepper and salt, and about a quart of gravy. Let them 
stew until tender, take them off, throw them into cold wate", 
and trim them neatly ; strain the gravy, thicken with a little 
flour and butter, add a glass of sherry, warm up the giblets in 
the gravy, and serve quite hot. 

DUCKS. 

223. — Roast in the same manner as goose. 

Stewed with Green Peas. — Truss the duck as you would a 
fowl to boil, that is, with the legs inwards. Melt a piece oi 



192 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIII. 

butter in a stewpan : cut up in dice ^ inch square about i Ih. 
of streaked bacon ; put the duck and the bacon into the butter. 
When the duck is browned take it out, put in a tablespoonful 
of €our, add broth or water sufficient to half cover the duck ; 
throw in li pint of peas, with an onion, and a faggot of parsley, 
thyme, and a bay-leaf. When the duck is done, strain off some 
of the gravy, thicken the peas with flour and butter, add a lump 
of sugar, and pepper and salt if required. The peas should 
hang together, and all the fat be removed. 

Oj- : — Put a few sage-leaves and some pepper inside the 
duck, half roast it, then dredge, and put it in a stewpan, with 
a little piece of butter, as much water as will cover it, an onion, 
a bunch of parsley and mint, pepper, and salt. Let it stew 
till nearly done, then strain the sauce ; add a pint of young 
shelled peas, and stew all together, until the whole is sufficiently 
cooked. 

With Turjiips. — Cut ^ a dozen turnips in shapes, and scorch 
or fry them in butter with a duck : then take out the turnips, 
add a little stock, an onion, pepper and salt, a bay-leaf, a few 
sage-leaves, and a sprig of thyme, and allow the duck to stew 
gently until quite tender : then strain and thicken the gravy, 
add the turnips to it, and serve it up. 

Stewed iviih Cahbage. — ^Boil a cabbage, and allow it to 
drain ; half roast a duck, and put it with the cabbage sliced 
thin into gravy, seasoned v/ith sweet marjoram, thyme, onions, 
pepper, and salt. Stew the duck until it is done enough, then 
strain and thicken the gravy ; dish the duck upon the cabbage, 
and pour the sauce round. — These dishes may be made with 
cold roast ducks that have appeared at table, but in that case 
the gravy must be enriched. 

Stewed in Claret. — Make a gravy of the giblets ; rub the 
duck inside and outside with pepper and a little salt ; peel 
and mince 2 or 3 onions, and, having half roasted the duck, 
put it into a stewpan with the gravy and onions. Let it stew 
very gently for ^ an hour, adding towards the end a glass 
of claret : squeeze the juice of a lemon over the duck, and 
serve it up w^ith fried bread or paste. The duck may be 
stuffed with forcemeat, in which a little sage should be 
chopped. 

To hash, — Cut a cold duck into joints, and warm it, without 



Chap. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 193 

boiling, in gravy, a glass of port wine, and a teaspoonful of 
made mustard. 

To boil. — Put the bird for a few minutes into warm water ; 
then take it out, and lay it in an earthen pan, pour a pint of 
boiling milk over it, and allow it to soak for 3 hours ; dredge 
it well with flour, and put it into cold water, let it boil for 
20 minutes, and then send it to table smothered with onion 
sauce. 

Canard farci. — Have a duck boned ; make a farce of veal 
and bacon-fat in equal proportions, chopped only ; season it ; 
iiil the duck ; tie it up in a cloth ; stew it in good gravy very 
gently for an hour ; take it up, glaze it, and serve it either with 
stewed peas, turnips, or sauce piquante. 

Ducks devilled. — Split the duck, prick it all over with a 
fork, cover it either with mustard and cayenne pepper, diavoli 
paste, or Chetney, and broil it. Serve with a glass of lemon- 
]>ickle, 1 of wine, and 1 of ketchui), v/armed with 3 table- 
spoonfuls of gravy. If Chetney be used the sauce will not 
require sugar, otherwise add a dessertspoonful of powdered 
white sugar. 

PIGEONS, 

224. — To roast Pigeons. — Scald some parsley, chop it with 
the livers, mix them with a piece of fresh butter, season with 
pepper and salt ; put a portion inside each pigeon ; cover the 
breast with a slice of bacon-fat ; roast them ; serve with parslev 
and butter in the dish. 

Or ; — Stuif the whole of the body of the pigeon with vea. 
stuffing. A fine farce, made of pounded veal and bacon, and 
bread steeped in milk, is an excellent stuffing for pigeons. 

Or : — Boil, pare, and pound chestnuts in a mortar, with 
<3qual weight of fat bacon finely rasped ; fill the pigeons v/ith this 
stuffing, cover them with slices of fat bacon, and v/rap them 
in young vine-leaves ; roast the whole together, and send them 
up with bacon and vine-leaves, which impart a fine flavour tr? 
the pigeons. Partridges may be dressed the same way, and 
truffles substituted for chestnuts. 

To broil Pigeons. — Cut the pigeon down the back, flatten 
and truss it as a fowl for broiling. Egg it on both sides ; 
season with pepper and salt ; dip it in chopped sweet herbs 
and bread-crumbs ; warm a little butter, sprinkle it over, and 
then dip the pigeon again in the crumbs. Broil it a light brown. 

K 



194 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Chap. XIII. 

serve with the following sauce : — chop fine a few shalots, boil 
them in a tablespoonful of vinegar, then add gravy, thicken 
with flour and butter, scald the liver, mince it, throw it into the 
sauce ; add pepper, salt, and a little ketchup, and 2 or 3 mush- 
rooms chopped. 

A la Frangaise. — When the pigeons are prepared for dress- 
ing, lay them in a dish, and pour over them 2 or 3 glasses ot 
port wine ; let them remain for some hours. Prepare a force- 
meat of chopped sage, a little bit of onion, some fat and lean 
bacon, and pepper ; moisten this with eo^^ or rich gravy : stufl 
the crops of the pigeons, and put them into the stew with the 
wine, 30 corns of pepper for 6 pigeons, a blade of mace, an 
onion, and a little broth. Stew them till tender, then take 
them out, beat up the yolk of an egg with some oiled butter, 
brush the pigeons thickly, cover them well with bread-crumbs : 
let them cool a little, then repeat the process. Put them into 
the oven just to brown, strain and thicken the gravy, nnd 
serve. 

A Ragout of Pigeons. — Stew the gizzards in a little water, 
with the trimmings ; chop them with the liver very small ; add 
grated ham, bread-crumbs, herbs, &c. ; make this into a force- 
meat, and fill the pigeons with it rolled round the yolk of a 
hard-boiled egg. Put the pigeons into a stewpan, with a 
little butter to brown them ; add the gravy from the gizzards, 
a little flour, and an onion : let them stew very gently, and 
then skim the gravy : add to it a glass of wine or sauce, and, 
having boiled up the gravy and thickened it, serve it with the 
pigeons. 

To dress Pigeons with Peas. — Put the pigeons into a stev/- 
pan, with a little butter just to stiflen them ; then take them 
out, put some small slices of bacon into the pan, give them a 
fine colour, then draw them, and add a spoonful of flour to 
the butter ; then put in the pigeons and bacon, turn them, 
moisten them by degrees ^vith gravy, and bring it to the con- 
sistency of sauce ; boil it ; season with parsley, young onions, 
a bay-leaf, and let it simmer. ^Vlien half done, put in a quart 
of peas ; shake them often ; when ready, take out the bay -leaf, 
thicken the peas with flour and butter, and dish the pigeons. 
There should be no gravy left. 

A Pupton of Pigeons may be much diversified in the ma- 
terial«, but is generally thought excellent. Lay a forcemeat, 



CnAP. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 19o 

made very savoury, in a small dish, like a paste lining ; then 
put in layers veiy thin slices of fat bacon, squab pigeons, 
sliced sweetbreads blanched, asparagus - tops, mushrooms, 
cocks' combs, a palate or two boiled quite tender and cut in 
slices, and the yolks of 4 eggs boiled hard. Lay more force- 
meat over the dish as a pie-crust, bake it, and turn it out to 
serve, with rich gravy in the dish ; or make it into a vol au vent. 

Pigeons in Jelly are a beautiful dish, and are prepared 
thus : — Save some of the liquor in which a knuckle of veal 
has been boiled, or boil a calf's or a neat's foot : put the 
broth into a pan with a blade of mace, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, some white pepper, lemon-peel, a slice of lean bacon, 
and the pigeons. The heads and feet must be left on, but 
clip the nails close. They must be trussed, with the legs bent 
as if sitting upon them, and the neck propped up with skewers, 
to appear in a natural state ; bake them, and let them stand 
to be cold ; season them as you like before baking. "When 
done, take them out of the liquor, cover them close to preserve 
the colour, and clear the jelly by boiling with the whites of 2 
eggs ; then strain it through a thick cloth dipped in boiling 
water, and put into a sieve. The fat must be perfectly re- 
moved before it be cleared. Put the jelly over and round them 
rough. 

Another luay. — Pick 2 very nice pigeons, leave the heads 
and the feet on, but clip the nails close to the claws ; truss 
them as above, roast them of a very nice brown, and when 
done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the bill of each. Have 
ready a savoury jelly as before, and with it half fill a bowl of 
such a size as shall be proper to turn down on the dish you 
mean it to be served in. When the jelly is cool and the birds 
are cold, see that no gravy hangs to the birds, and then lay 
them upside down in the jelly. Before the rest of it begins to 
set, pour it over the birds so as to be 3 inches above the feet. 
This should be done full 24 hours before serving. 

This dish has a very handsome appearance in the middle 
range of a second course ; or, when served with the jelly 
roughed large, it makes a side or corner dish, its size being 
then less. 

Wood-pigeons, — Let them hang to be tender ; roast and 
serve with a rich gravy. They must not be roasted so much 
as the common pigeons. 

k2 



196 



MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEIIY. CiiAr. XIII. 



Pigeons, woodcock fashion. — Clean and truss the pigeons, 
cat a slice of bread, toast and butter it, then chop equal 
quantities of mushrooms and anchovies very finely together, 
pepper it, spread it on the toast rather thickly, and put it 
under the pigeons while they are roasting. The anchovies 
should, however, be used sparingly, or their flavour will over- 
power that of the birds. 

LARKS.— E. R. 
225. — Larks may be roasted encased in fat bacon, and 
covered with vine-leaves. Or, rub the larks over with e^g, 
and dip them in fresh bread-crumbs, sprinkling a little salt 
over them ; roast before a quick fire, basting with fresh butter, 
tlie spit turning rapidly. Sparrows, when young and plump, 
are excellent eating, if cooked in the same way, skewered toge- 
ther, and the skewers tied on a spit. Woodcocks, s?iipes, and 
(/reen plovers, are not to be drawn ; lay a toast under them 
while roasting, to catch the trail ; serve them up with good 
gravy and bread-sauce. 

To stew Larks. — Put a number of fat and well -cleaned larks 
into a stewpan, having put a delicate bit of bacon into the 
inside of each, with a sufficient quantity of good stock gravy : 
place sage-leaves over the breasts of each, and over that a thin 
wrapper of bacon ; stew them gently, and serve hot. 

A Vltalieune. — Scald «our grapes, and then stone them ; 
beat up 2 yolks of eggs with a spoonful of lemon-juice, a very 
little flour, a bit of butter, and chopped parsley ; season it 
liighlv with cayenne pepper ; add a spoonful or two of gravy. 
Boil this a moment, then put in the grapes, and stir them with 
a spoon on the fire to warm, without boiling. Roast the lark 
with bread-crumbs, and serve them up with the sauce. The 
sauce should be very sharp and highly seasoned. 

A la Macedoine. — 
Have a dozen larks 
boned ; make d, farce 
with their livers and 
a little veal (game 
livers or rabbit meat 
will answer as well) 
and an equal quan- 
tity of fat bacon , 
Larks. pound it fine; season 




Chap. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 197 

■with herbs and seasoning spice ; fill the larks ; put them in a 
stewpan with a little very good gravy ; bake them for i of 
an hour ; glaze them ; dish them up on a border of mashed 
potatoes, filling up the centre and round the sides with carrots, 
turnips, &c., as represented in the cut ; pour a good gravy 
round the dish. 

TVHEATEARS-E. R. 
226. — May be dressed in the same manner as larks ; or. 
w^hen trussed for roasting, brush each bird over with the yolk 
of an egg, or, what is better, dip them in batter ; roll them in 
fine bread-crumbs, and spit them on a wooden or silver skewer, 
a dozen upon each. When spitted, brush them again with the 
egg, and dredge them with the bread-crumbs ; tie the skewers 
upon a spit, and roast them before a brisk fire, basting all the 
time with fresh butter : they will take about 12 minutes. They 
should be dressed the same day on which they are killed. 



VENISON". 

If the venison be fresh, merely dry it with a cloth, and 
liang it in an airy place. Should it be necessary to keep it 
for any length of time, rub it all over with beaten ginger. 
If it happen to be musty, wash it, first, with lukewarm water, 
and, secondly, with milk and water, also lukewarm. Then 
dry it very well with clean cloths, and rub it over with 
powdered ginger. Observe the same method with hare. It 
must be looked at every day, and peppered if attacked by flies. 

Yenison should be fat, and kept until quite tender. A 
haunch of buck will take 4 or o hours roasting ; doe, only 2^ 
hours. Venison should be rather under than over done. Gravy 
for it should be put into a boat, and not into the dish. Use 
water-plates, or have your plates set over heaters. Currant 
jelly should be brought up cold. 

227. — • To roast a Hamncli of Venisoii. — Cut off the knuckle, 
trim the flap, and remove the thick skin on the flank ; nick the 
joint at the cramp-bone, which will make the cushion fuller 
when roasted. vSpit it, rub it over with butter, sprinkle well 
with salt, cover it with a sheet of very thin paper, then with a 
paste of flour and water, and again with paper ; tie it up well 
with siout string laced across it ; baste it all the time it is 



i93 MCDEK^N^ DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XHL 



roasting, wliich will be from 4 to 5 hours, i of an hour 
before sending it to table remove the paste, throw a good 
handful of salt on it, dredge with flour, and baste with a little 
fresh butter. 

Venison Steaks. — Cut them from the neck; season them 
with pepper and salt. When the gridiron has been well heated 
over a bed of bright coals, grease the bars, and lay the steaks 
uDon it. Broil them v-^ell, turning them once, and taking care 
to save as much of the gravy as possible. Serve them up with 
some currant-jelly laid on each steak. 

To hash cold Venison. — Cut the meat in nice small slices, 
and put the trimmings and bones into a saucepan with barely 
water enough to cover them, and an onion. Let them stew for 
2 hours ; then strain the liquid into a stewpan ; add to it 
some bits of butter rolled in flour, and whatever gravy was 
left of the venison. Stir in some currant-jelly, and boil it ^ 
an hour ; then put in the meat and a glass of port wine ; keep 
it over the fire just long enough to warm it through, but do 
not allow it to boil. 



GAME 

Ought not to be tlirown away even when it has been kept 
a very long time ; for when it seems to be spoiled, it may often 
be made fit for eating by nicely cleaning it, and washing with 
vinegar and water. If there is danger of birds not keeping, 
draw, crop, and pick them ; then wash in 2 or 3 waters, and 
rub them with salt. Have ready a large saucepan of boiling 
water, and plunge them into it one by one, drawing them up 
and down by the legs, that the water may pass through them. 
Let them stay in it 5 or 6 minutes ; then hang them up in a 
cold place. AYhen drained, pei)per and salt the inside well. 
By this method the most delicate birds may be preserved. 
Before roasting, wash them well. But, as a general rule, no 
game should be washed, for one half the game that is sent to 
table is spoiled by being saturated in water. 

In dressing Game be careful to keep a clear fire. Let it bo 
done of a bright brown, but not much roasted, or the fine 
flavour will be destroyed. It requires to be continually 
basted, and to be sent up beautifully frothed. Wild-fowl take 
a much shorter time than domestic poultry. 



GuAP. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 199 

The following will give, pretty nearl}', the time required 
for roasting the several birds : — Wild-ducks i of an hour, 
widgeons the same, pheasants ^ an hour, grouse i of an hour, 
quails 10 minutes, woodcocks 20 minutes, partridges from 20 
to 25 minutes. A hare will take an hour ; the hind part re- 
quires most heat, and that should be attended to, as it com- 
monly happens that the thick part of the thigh is underdone, 
as well as the shoulders. The blood stagnated round the neck 
and shoulders is not easily removed : to do this, put those parts 
into a pan of lukewarm water, and prick them with a skewer ; 
before dressing, rub and squeeze it out. 

To take oiF the fishy taste which wild-fowl sometimes have, 
put an onion, salt, and hot water into the dripping-pan, and 
baste them for the first 10 minutes with this ; then take away 
the pan, and baste constantly with butter. 

PHEASANTS AND PARTRIDGES. 

228. — Eoast them, and serve with a fine gravy and bread- 
sauce in separate tureens. The cock-pheasant keeps longer 
than the hen. When cold, they may be made into excellent 
patties, but their flavour should not be overpowered by any 
admixture. 

It is not usual to stuflP pheasants ; though they are some- 
times larded ; but the follov/ing forcemeat will be found a 
great improvement. Cut a piece of lean veal into small dies, 
with about a third of bacon also minced, season it with a 
little pepper, and put it into the body of the pheasant, which 
must be tied, to prevent the escape of the stuffing, or roasted 
with the head dovv^nwards. The gravy from the veal will dif- 
fuse itself through the pheasant, and render it more juicy and 
lender, while the bacon is always to be preferred when put in- 
side a bird, though the outer larding may be baore ornamental. 
Beef is sometimes substituted for veal. 

Partridges, being less dry than pheasants, do not require 
stuffing, although they are improved by it, made either of 
chestnuts or truffles and bacon. They are sometimes roasted, 
wrapped in bacon and vine-leaves : bread-crumbs are essential. 
In some parts of Kent partridges are sent up with toreemeat- 
balls in the dish. 

To stew Partridges. — Truss them with the wings over the

long strips, and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter

the size of a walnut. Fry the bacon brown, and when quite 
done put in the partridges, and keep turning them until they 
are very brown, taking care that the bacon shall be as much 
on the breast as possible ; then add about a teacupful of gravy 
and some trimmings of meat and vegetables. Have ready u 
large cabbage boiled ; when well drained, slice it with butter, 
pepper, and salt, put it while warm with the gravy to the 
partridges, and let them stew gently for an hour, turning the 
birds frequently. Serve up with the bacon underneath, and the 
cabbage round them, squeezed dry, and the sauce well skimmed. 
Or : — Take 4 young partridges nicely cleaned, and put 
them into a deep cooking-pot, with a piece of butter and a 
little water ; put them on a brisk fire ; keep the cover of the 
pot on, and move it about constantly, to prevent the birds 
burning or browning on the bottom. The partridges are suffi- 
ciently cooked the instant the red gravy is seen to drip from 
the bird, and mix with the melted butter. Serve them up hot, 
with a small quantity of cayenne pepper. 

Salmi of Partridge. — Half roast the partridges, cut them 
up neatly, take off the skin ; put the trimmings into a stewpan, 
with a bit of butter and a tablespoonful of flour ; stir the whole 
over the fire, then add a glass of Avhite wine and a little gravy 
or stock, some shalots, chopped parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, 
pepper, salt ; let it boil fast for ^ an hour, strain, skim, add 
the juice of a lemon, and make the partridge hot in the sauce. 

Or : — Roast the partridges, leaving them underdone. AVheii 
cold, cut them into pieces, taking off the skin. Put 3 spoon- 
fuls of oil into a saucepan, a glass of claret, salt, pepper, a 
shalot, and the juice of a lemon. Toss the partridges in this 
•sauce until they are sufficiently done to send to table. 

Or : — Cut up and place on a dish the breasts, wings, and legs 
of any roasted game you may have left ; cover it with another 
dish, or tin cover, and set it over a pan of boiling water to keep 
warm. Then pound the small bones of the carcase, with the 
inside, in a mortar, and put them into a saucepan with a little 
gravy thickened with a little flour rolled in butter, a wine-glass 
of port wine, a spoonful of ketchup, a very small piece of shalot 
chopped fine, cayenne pepper, and salt. When it has been 
boiled for J of an hour, strain it through a sieve, to form it 
into a perfect puree, and pour it over the game in your dish ; 
garnish with forcemeat-balls, and slices of lemon cut thin. 



Chap. XIII. POULTBY AND GAME. 201 

Broiled Partridge. — Cut the bird down the back ; break 
the merrythought, which will allow it to be made quite flat ; 
cut off the feet at the joint, and skewer it as a fowl to broil ; 
dry, flour, egg, and sprinkle it with chopped herbs and bread- 
crumbs, well seasoned ; broil and serve with a little good 
gravy, with a mushroom or two chopped up small. 

Or : — Omit the egg and crumbs, broil it quite plain, rub 
it . over with butter, season with pepper and salt, and serve 
without gravy, squeezing half a lemon over it as it leaves the 
kitchen. This is a good way of dressing the small partridge* 
that are sometimes shot at the commencement of September, 
and will be found an excellent relish for breakfast. 

Gumea and Peafowl taste much like pheasant if properly 
hung : dress and serve the same way. 

WOODCOCKS, SNIPES, AND QUAILS 

229. — Keep good several days. Eoast them without draw- 
ing, and serve on toast : the trail of the former is the most 
esteemed part of the bird ; but the thigh and back are the best 
parts. In helping, the carver must be careful to remove first 
a small bitter bag from the trail. Or, take out the trail, chop 
it well, spread it on a buttered toast, season with pepper and 
salt, sprinkle a few crumbs over, and brown it in front of the 
fire under the woodcocks. 

Quail and Ortolans. — Cut a thin piece of fat bacon the size 
of the breast ; lay a vine-leaf over the breast, and then the 
bacon ; fasten with string, and roast them. 

GROUSE AND MOORCOCK.~E. R. 

230. — Mix a small lump of butter with a few bread-ciTsmbs, 
and put it in the inside of the birds — not in the crop — it keeps 
them moist. They require to be nicely roasted and well basted, 
otherwise they become dry. Serve with fried bread-crumbs 
or bread-sauce ; in trussing, the head should be tvsdsted under 
the wing. 

WILD DUCKS— E. R. 

231. — Must be roasted at a very brisk fire ; they take from 
12 to 20 minutes, according to taste. Some people are of 
opinion that they sliould only fly through the kitchen : by epi- 
cures they are considered to be in true perfection when they 
come up dry and brown, and, when cut, flood the dish with 

K 3 



202 MODERN" DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIII. 



gravy. The means of ensuring success consists in a very 
ardent fire, rapid motion of the spit, and constant basting. 
The carver should score the breast of the duck, imt a piece of 
butter on it, and cut a lemon in half, putting on one half a 
spoojjful of salt, and on the other a cayenne-spoonful of cay- 
enne ; put the two together, and squeeze vigorously over the 
duck ; then pour over them a wine-glass of hot port-wine ; 
but those who desire to taste duck par excelle?ice should sub- 
stitute shickaree-s-di\ce for the lemon. 

To steio Wild Duck. — Shred thyme, winter savory, and 
sage, very small, and put them into some strong broth, with a 
little pepper, salt, and 2 spoonfuls of wine ; stew them together 
for \ of an hour ; nearly roast the ducks, add the gravy that 
falls from them, but not the fat ; then place a deep dish under 
them, and pour this sauce through and over them into it. 
Remove the ducks, cut them up, and put them with the sauce 
into a stewpan over a stove, and let them stew till they are 
done enough. 

Wild Ducks, Teal, Widgeons, and Dun-birds should be 
taken up with the gravy in. Baste them with butter, and 
sprinkle a little salt before they are taken up, put a good gravy 
upon them, and serve with shalot-sauce in a boat. 

Landrail^ Ruffs, and Rees are skewered as quails ; put thin 
slices of bacon over them, and roast them about 10 minutes. 
Serve with a good gravy in the dish. 

S WAR TZAIN—E. R. 
232. — Is a Dutch dish made thus : — Take the blood of a 
fowl or duck, stir it with a little vinegar and salt until it is 
quite cold ; then cut up the duck, or small cutlets of tender 
mutton, season it well, and stew it in a little water. When 
partly stewed add the blood, mix it well together, and keep 
stirring wliile it stews. By those persons who do not object 
to the ingredients, this dish will be found excellent. 

PLOVERS. 
233. — Roast the golden plover in the same way as wood- 
cocks and quails, without drawing ; and serve on a toast. 

Grey Plovers. — Draw them : they may be either roasted or 
gtewed with gravy, herbs, and spice. 

Plover's Eggs. — Boil them 10 minutes, and serve either hot 



Chap. XIII. POULTRY AND GAME. 203 

or cold ; the former on a napkin, the latter on moss. Send to 
table with the second course. 

HARES, 

234. — If properly taken care of, will keep a considerable 
time, and even when the cook fancies them past eating may 
be in the highest perfection, which they cannot be if eaten 
when fresh killed. As they are usually paunched in the field, 
the cook cannot prevent this ; but the hare keeps longer, and 
eats much better, if not opened for 4 or 5 days, or according 
to the weather. 

If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should be wiped 
quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and the liver scalded 
to keep for the stuffing. Kepeat this wiping every day ; mix 
pepper and ginger, and rub on the inside ; and put a large 
piece of charcoal into it, to prevent the musty taste occasioned 
by damp. 

Hares should never be hung by the /ii?id legs ; for, as the 
animal is commonly kept for a week or 10 days, if so hung, 
drops of moisture will in a couple of days be seen to issue from 
the mouth, thus draining the carcase of its natural juice. It 
should, therefore, be always suspended by ihe fore Legs. 

An old hare should be kept as long as possible, if to be 
roasted. It must also be Vv ell soaked ; and vvhile roasting it 
must be constantly basted with butter, or the skin will become 
hardened and the flesh rendered sapless. 

Hare requires to be kept at a distance from the fire. Send 
it to table with currant-jelly and gravy. It is now the fashion 
to bone hares, which greatly improves their appearance, lessens 
the difficulty of carving, and assists in making the gravy. 
Break the bones, and stew them in water, and any small 
quantity of meat parings ; boil the liver, which is to be chopped 
and put into the stuffing, in this gravy, and add a little brown- 
ing to give it a colour. 

235. — To roast Hare. — After it is skinned, let it be well 
wiped ; and, if old, lard it, which will make it tender, as will 
also letting it lie in vinegar. If, however, it is put into 
vinegar, it should be exceedingly well washed in water after- 
wards. Put a large well-seasoned veal stuffing into tlie belly, 
and then sew it up. When first put to the fire, pour some 
boiling water over the head and shoulders ; then baste it well 
with milk till half done,, and afterwards with butter. The hdtxi-. 



204 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XIII. 



should be kept at a distance from the fire at first. Serve with 
a fine froth, rich gravy, and currant-jeily sauce ; little gravy 
in the dish. A stuffing may be made with the liver pounded, 
an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, pepper, salt, 
nutmeo-, crumbs of bread, and an egg to bind it all. The ears 
must be nicely cleaned, singed, and made crisp, being reckoned 
a dainty. 

With Cream-sauce. — Boil the liver, and chop it very fine ; 
mix a small portion with the stuffing, and reserve the remain- 
der for the sauce. Put a bunch of sweet herbs into the drip- 
ping-pan, and pour a quart of good milk over it. Baste the 
hare continually with the milk, and when it is rather more than 
half roasted take the sauce out of the dripping-pan, and put 
another quart of new milk to the herbs. Take the hare, and 
slit the neck in order that the gravy may run from it into the 
milk that has been added ; then skewer the head down again ; 
baste continually as before, until within 20 minutes of its being 
served ; then remove the milk, and baste v/ith butter, dredging 
it gently with flour twice during that time : add the two quan- 
tities of milk together ; stir in a lump of butter and flour ; put 
in the chopped liver, warm it over the fire, stirring all the 
time, being careful not to let it boil, as that would curdle it. 
The hare must be well wiped with a dry cloth previous to 
spitting, but on no account be washed, as that would spoil it. 

To cook a Hare Derrynane fashion. — Take 3 or 4 eggs, a 
pint of new milk, 2 handfuls of flour ; make them into a batter, 
and, v.^hen the hare is roasting, baste it v\^ell, repeating the 
operation until the batter thickens and forms a coating all 
over the hare : this should be allowed to broicn but not to 
hum. 

Old hares should be jugged. 

Leicestershire Jugged Hare. — Skin the hare, and cut it in 
pieces, but do not wash it ; strew it over with pepper and salt, 
fry it brown. Make a seasoning of 2 anchovies, a sprig of 
thyme, a little parsley, a nutmeg grated, a little mace, a few 
cloves pounded, and a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel. Strew 
this over Ihe hare, after having carefully taken it out of the 
pan clear of fat : slice i lb. of fat bacon very thin, put it into 
a jug or jar, a layer of hare and one of bacon upon it, until 
the whole is put in, then add rather less than \ pint of ale ; 
cover the jug very closely, so as perfectly to keep in the steam; 



CiiAP. XIII. POULTRY ATs'D GAME. 205 

put it into a kettle of cold water, lay a tile on the top of the 
jug, and let it boil 3 hours if the hare be young, or 4 or 5 if 
an old one. Take the jug out of the kettle, pick out all the 
bacon which has not melted, and shake the hare up in a stew- 
pan, with a little mushroom-ketchup, a glass of port wine, 
a little mushroom-powder if at hand, and a little butter and 
flour, well mixed together to thicken the gravy. A tea- 
spoonful of lemon-pickle, and 1 of browning, will heighten 
the flavom*. 

LEVERET, OR RABBIT, WITH HERBS.— E. R. 

236. — Cut either of the two into pieces, put it into a stew- 
pan with butter, salt, pepper, parsley, sorrel, and young onions 
chopped. When sufficiently done, add the juice of a lemon. 
The legs may be broiled and laid on the top. 

RABBITS.— E. R. 

237. — Eabbits, being rather dry meat, are much improved 
by larding. Should the process be deemed too troublesome 
upon common occasions, a good effect may be produced by 
lining the inside of the rabbit with slices of fat JDacon previ- 
ously to putting in the stuffing. This is a very easy method 
of improvement, and ought never to be neglected. 

A boned rabbit, larded, stuffed, and braised, affords a cheap 
and elegant side-dish for a dinner party. 

Roamed. — Have the rabbit trussed like a hare. Fill it v/ith 
veal stuffing made with rather a larger proportion of marjoram 
than usual ; egg the rabbit and co^^er vdth bread-crumbs. 
Chop up the liver fine ; throw it into some good gravy for 
sauce. It should be served nicely frothed. 

Boiled ivith Onions. — ^Boil slowly, and send to table covered, 
or " smothered," with onion sauce. 

Boiled ivith Jerusalem Articliokes . — Cut the rabbits in 
ioints, put them on to boil, with water barely covering them. 
When about half done, put to them some Jerusalem artichokes 
sliced, a sufficient quantity to make the sauce thick ; and 
when they are done, mash them as you would turnips ; add a 
little of the liquor they were boiled in, pepper, salt, and a 
little cream ; pour over the rabbits, and serve. 

Fried. — Cut them in joints, parboil them, egg them, and 



206 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIII. 

cover with chopped herbs and crumbs ; fr}^ them. Serve with 
liver sauce made a little sharp with lemon-juice. 

Or : — Cut the rabbit in joints, parboil it ; put it in a pan 
with a little oil, tarragon vinegar, pepper, salt, a slice or two 
of onion ; soak it for 3 hours ; then dry it, dip in batter, fry 
crisply. Serve with tomata sauce. 

Curry of Rabbit. — Proceed as for Curry of Chicken, 
p. 188. 

To make a Rabbit taste much like Hare. — Choose one that 
is young, but full-grov/n ; hang it i'l the skin 3 or 4 days ; then 
skin it ; and lay it, without washing, in a seasoning of black 
pepper and allspice in a very fine powder, a glass of port wine, 
and the same quantity of vinegar. Baste it occasionally for 
40 hours ; then stuff it, and roast it as a hare, and with 
the same sauce. Do not wash oif the liquor that it was 
soaked in. 

A la Franf;aise. — S4iould be cut in pieces ; reserve the 
liver, put some pieces of bacon into a stewpan, and brown 
them well, then take them out, and put a piece of butter and 
i}[iQ rabbit in the pan ; turn and toss it well. When it is 
getting brown, dredge a tablespoonful of flour over it, turning- 
all the while, and when the flour is dry put the rabbit in a 
plate. Then add a piece more butter to the remaining sauce, 
and stir it well together, and when brown add a cupful of 
water ; continue stirring, and put in the rabbit with plenty of 
very small onions, the bacon, some mushrooms, a bunch of 
parsley and thyme and a bay- leaf tied with a thread, and some 
salt and pepper ; let it stew very gently over a slow fire for 
4 hours. Add the liver and a glass of port Avine 1 hour before 
serving, and, should there not be suflftcient sauce, a little gravy 
from time to time put in hot. 

Stewed with Onions. — Cut up the rabbits, reserving the 
livers. Put a piece of butter rolled in flour into a stewpan, 
add boiling water, stirring till well mixed, a little pepper and 
salt, and then the rabbits slightly dredged with flour. Let 
them stew till tender, boil a bunch of parsley, put the livers 
into the stew, and when they are done enough chop them with 
the parsley, a little pepper and salt, and enough cream to 
jnake them into sauce ; warm it up in a small saucepan, and 
spread it equally over the rabbit ; have ready 6 large onions, 
boiled and pulped through a sieve, and mixed up with cream. 



Chap. XIII. POULTRY AKD GAMP]. 207 

Put the onions into the centre of a dish, the rabbits round, and 
the gravy the last. 

Stewed with Mushrooms. — Boil 2 anchovies or a table- 
spoonful of the essence in milk and water, pepper and salt, and 
an onion. Cut up the rabbit, and stew it gently until done 
enough ; then strain the gravy, add a little butter rolled in 
flour, a glass of wine, and mushrooms. Toss the whole toge- 
ther, squeeze a little lemon-juice over the rabbit, or pour 
lemon-pickle upon it, and send it to table with the sauce, and 
the liver made into forcemeat-balls. 

Quenelles de Lapereau. — Cut the meat from a rabbit, 
scrape it from the sinews, and pound it thoroughly. Boil a 
calf's udder, and when cold pound it as tine as butter. IMake 
a panada thus : take a tablespoonful of cho.pped mushrooms, 
as much green lemon-peel as will lie on a shilling, a \evy little 
chopped shalot and thyme, and a good pinch of chopped par- 
sley, pepper and salt, and a piece of butter ; sweat the whole 
over the fire ; take 2 French rolls, soak the crumb in milk, 
squeeze it dry, add it and a spoonful of white sauce to the 
herbs, dry it over the fire ; when quite stiff", take it off* and 
add the yolk of an egg. Put it in a cool place ; when cold 
take equal quantities of meat, udder, and panada, pound for 
20 minutes, add 1 whole egg, try it and see if it requires more 
seasoning ; rub it through a fine sieve. Make the quenelles 
in tablespoons, poach them in boiling water for about 10 
minutes : serve with white sauce, or white mushroom sauce. 

To form Quenelles. — When the forcemeat is made, take 2 
tablespoons, fill 1 with the meat, dip a knife in hot water, with 
which smooth it over ; then dip the other spoon into boiling- 
water, and with it remove the meat from the first spoon, and 
slip it into a buttered stewpan ; so on, until you have the 
number you want ; then cover them with stock, and boil them 
about 10 minutes, or until firm, and they are fit for use. For 
small quenelles use teaspoons. 

The Kloes of Berlin are a sort of Quenelles made of flour, 
or the soft part of bread steeped in milk ; also of rice or semo- 
lina, boiled in broth, as they may be either made savoury or 
sweet, and may be composed either of poultry or any kind of 
white meat, as well as in the following manner : — 

Melt i lb. of butter, and break into it the yolks of 6 and 
tlie whites of 4 eggs, seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and 



208 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIII. 

nutmeg ; all whipped together in 3 small cups of milk, and 
made into a paste by the proper addition of flour. From this 
paste form bails of a moderate size — for they will s^vell in the 
boiling water, in which they must be left for 8 to 10 minutes. 
Then take them out with a skimmer, and serve them either as 
a garnish for ragouts and dishes of vegetables ; or else piled 
uf) in the centre of a small dish, and surrounded with fried 
potatoes. 

Pilau of Rabbit. — Cut up a rabbit or fowl ; pound a couple 
of onions in a mortar ; extract the juice, and mix it with a 
saltspoonful of ground ginger, a teaspoonful of salt, and the 
juice of a lemon : rub this into the meat ; cut up 2 onions 
in slices, and fry them in J lb. of butter. When brown take 
them out, and put in the meat ; let them stew together. 
Have 1 lb. of rice half boiled in broth ; put the whole meat, 
&c., into a jar, with i pint of milk, some whole peppercorns, 
half a dozen cloves, and a little more salt. Secure the 
mouth of the jar, and bake it until done enough, adding a 
little broth should the butter and milk not be sufficient to 
moisten it. 



TO CRISP PARSLEY. 

238. — Pick some bunches of young parsley, wash them, and 
swing them in a cloth to dry ; put them on a sheet of paper 
in a toaster before the fire, and keep them frequently turned 
till they are quite crisp, which will be in about 6 or 8 
minutes. 

To fry Parsley. — When the parsley has been washed and 

thoroughly dried, throw it into 

lard or butter which is on the 

point to boil ; take it up with 

a slice the instant it is crisp, 

and lay it on paper on a sieve 

w T. , i. r T • before the fire. A wire basket

IS the nicest thmg to use lor 

frying parsley, or anything small requiring to be fried. 




FRIED BREAD FOR GARNISHING. 
239. — Take slices of stale bread about a third of an inch 
thick, cut them into shapes with a paste-cutter, fry them in 
fresh butter a light brown, lay them upon a cloth to dry, and 



Chap. XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. 209 

place them round, the dish. They may be made to adhere 
by brushing the under part with a little tlour mixed with white 

JBread-crumbs. — All game and small birds are improved 
by the addition of bread-crumbs, either fried or toasted ; the 
latter is the more delicate preparation : grate the crumbs, and 
put tliem into a tin shallow dish before the fire, shaking them 
occasionally until they are well browned : send them up in 
the dish ; with a tureen of good brown gravy made from the 
insides and trimmings of the birds, but without any kind of 
seasoning. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

SALT-WATER FISH. 

The great excellence of English Jish, and the fresh state in 
which it is, in London, generally brought to table, combined 
with the simplicity of our national tastes in cookery, render 
it unnecessary to resort to much art in the preparation of the 
finer kinds, which are usually preferred simply boiled, broiled, 
or fried ; but this only holds good with the superior varieties, 
whereas skate, halibut, ling, plaice, flounders, mackerel, and 
many others, may be much improved by the method of dressing 
I hem. 

There is perhaps no article of eatables in which imposition 
is more practised in London than in fish ; and if you are 
not yourself a good judge, you will be almost sure to be de- 
ceived unless you always deal with the same fishmonger, and 
he is of respectable character ; for the lower class of petty 
dealers never have in their shops any of the finer sorts of good 
quality. You must therefore either pay a good price, or con- 
iine yourself to those ordinary species which are in common 
use, and plentiful in the market. 

Preparatory to the dressing, the fish should be carefully 
gutted by the fishmonger, and afterwards cleaned thoroughly 
by the cook from all appearances of blood, particularly 
scraping the blood that lodges about the backbone, and cutting 
the fish open below the vent. If, however, the fishmonger 
does not clean it, fish is seldom very nicely done, for common 



210 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XIV. 

cooks are apt not to slit the fish low enough, by which, and 
not thoroughly washing the blood, &c., from the bone, a very 
disgusting mass is left within, and mistaken for liver; but 
fishmongers generally wash it beyond what is necessary for 
cleaning, and by perpetual watering diminish the flavour. It 
should, in fact, be handled as little as possible, and never left 
in the water a moment after it is washed. In washing it, the 
best way is to hold the fish firmly by the head with your left 
hand, and scrape off the scales or slime ; wash it once in clean 
cold water, and either dry it with a towel or hang it up and 
leave it to drain. 

Some kinds of fish will bear keeping better than others, but 
few are improved by it ; some kinds are said to lose much of 
their delicacy and peculiar flavour every hour after the tide in 
which they were caught is lost. Turbot is stated to improve 
by keeping for a day or two ;^ but the acknowledged supe- 
riority of the Dublin Bay turbot is said to arise from its being 
dressed immediately upon being caught, "as it then tastes 
as if it had been boiled in cream." Salmon, in losing a tide, 
loses a portion of the fine white curd which intervenes between 
each flake, and subsequently becomes more rich, but changes 
its character, the large flakes disappearing with the curd with 
which they are amalgamated. " Much also depends upon 
knowing in what way each particular fish may be cooked so as 
to make its appearance to the greatest advantage. Many there 
are that are unpalatable when dressed in one particular way, 
but very good if another mode of cooking be adopted. A 
stewed carp affords a really splendid dish ; a boiled carp one 
of the worst that can be brought to table. The merits of a 
red mullet broiled, baked, or fried, enveloped in white paper, 
with its liver for sauce, are too well known to require any 
comment; and yet, when simply boiled and gutted as you 
would a whiting, it is a sad woolly and insipid affair." ^ The 
crimping of fish causes it to eat crisp, and so improves the 
firmness if it be woolly ; but it is unnecessary to perform the 
operation while the animal is alive, though it should be done 
soon afterw^ards. 

Fish that is to be boiled must be put on the fire in cold hard 

Ude — who ought to be a good judge — states, in his * Cookery,' from his 
many years' observation, "that a turbot kept two or three days is much 
better eating than a fresh one." — p. 238. 
'' Piscator on Fish, p. 8. 



Chap. XIY. SALT-WATEK FISH. 21 1 

water ; when it boils, skim with the greatest care ; throw in a 
little cup of cold water to check the extreme of heat, then keep 
it simmering only, lest the outside break before the thick and 
inner part be done; but " crimped fish" should be put into 
boiling water, and simmered a few minutes. A large handful 
of coarse salt, vnih. a small piece of saltpetre, and a little horse- 
radish, should be also put into the water in which fish is boiled ; 
and it is rendered firmer by the addition of 2 or 3 spoonfuls 
of vinegar. In France they add to this a quantity of spice, 
thyme, laurel-leaves, and garlic ; and, as wine is there cheap, 
they sometimes use vin ordinaire instead of water. This, how- 
ever, is not thrown away, for it is equally good when reboiled. 
Cod, haddock, and whiting eat firmer if a little salt be put into 
their gills, and they be hung up a few hours before dressing. 

Care must be taken to preserve the roe, milt, and liver 
whole ; to let them be suflftciently dressed ; and to place them 
conspicuously when served. The sound adhering to the bone 
must be left there, but very carefully cleaned. When the fish 
is dished up, it should be placed at once upon the table. To 
judge if a large fish be sufficiently boiled, draw up the fish- 
plate, and with a thin knife try if the fish easily divides from 
the bone in the thick parts, which it wdll when done enough. 
Keep it hot, not by letting it sodden in the water, but by 
laying the fish-plate crossways on the kettle, and covering with 
a thick cloth wetted with hot water ; for if left in the water 
after it is ready it loses its firmness, and becomes woolly. 
Always serve boiled fish on a double napkin, and put the 
white side of flat fish upwards. On this subject, although aware 
of the more fashionable mode being to lay the fish on a silver 
drainer, we still hold to the antiquated folded napkin, the neat 
whiteness of which equals silver in appearance, while its tex- 
ture better drains the moisture from the fish. The dish cer- 
tainly looks more complete if fried fish be served round the 
boiled ; but this should be confined to the small fry of smelts 
or gudgeons, alternately placed with the roe or milt, merely 
as a garnish. Great care is necessary to drain the water from 
the boiled fish, that the dryness and colour of the fried fish 
may not be lessened. 

In the frying of Jisli, one great point is to prepare it pro- 
perly. Take, for instance, a sole, lay it on a cloth, wipe it 
thoroughly dry on both sides, then dredge it with flour, beat 
up an e^^, and lay it on with a brush, strewing on it finely- 



212 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIV, 

grated bread or biscuit crumbs ; have the fat so boiling hot 
that all the hissing and bubbling must have subsided before 
the fish is put in, and let the quantity not be stinted, or tiic 
fish, when taken out. will be greasy. The fryingpan must be 
put upon a clear cinder fire, and not left for a moment until 
the fish is done at a moderate rate, neither too quickly nor too 
slowly ; and when done, lay it upon a cloth or writing-paper 
to drain off the fat. 

Hog's-lard and butter are the materials most generally used* 
as are also the drippings from roast meat ; for a great prejudice 
exists in England against frying ^vith oil. arising no doubt 
partly from expense as well as dislike, although it is more 
delicate than any fatty substance that can be employed for 
that purpose. Throughout the southern countries of Europe 
nothing else is ever used in the frying of either fish or meat of 
any kind, and dishes thus dressed ever appear superior on the 
foreign tables to those of our own. The oil. if skimmed when 
done Avith, may be employed again until entirely used ; and 
lard, if poured into cold water when melted, will harden on the 
surface. The largeness of quantity does not therefore occasion 
additional cost. 

In hroilinfj Jish, care should be taken to make the gridiron 
very hot, and to rub the bars with butter. Fish prepared for 
broiling, after it is washed, should be rubbed well with vine- 
gar, dried in a cloth, and floured — the vinegar preserving the 
skin entire, and the flour preventing it sticking to the bars. 
A cinder or a charcoal fire is the best, but a little salt thrown 
on a coal fire will check the smoke, and cause it to burn like 
embers. 

In the dressing of flat fish as cutlets, the fillets should be 
lifted from the bones, and the spine which runs through the 
centre of the round sorts should be extracted. 

The steicing of Jish, and dressing it in fillets or cutlets, 
requires considerably more care in the cooking, as well as cost 
in the ingredients, than either of the previous modes ; and as 
a prelimiuEiry to the operation, a gra^-y should be got ready, to 
be made in the follo^"ing manner : — Take out all the bones, 
cut off the heads and tails, and, if this should not be sufficient, 
add a flounder, an eel, or any small common fish ; stew them 
with an onion, pepper, salt, and sweet herbs ; strain it, and 
thicken it to the consistency of cream, flavouring m ith a slight 
addition of wine or any other sauce. The French employ the 



Chap. XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. 213 

commonest sorts of their wine as a marhiade, or sauce, boti; 
ibr the boiling and stewing of fish ; and that of English growth 
may be substituted in this country, if the cheaper kinds of 
foreign wine should be thought too expensive. Families who 
have no home-made wine of their own may use cider instead, 
but it will not afford the flavour of wine of even an inferior 
description. 

3IARi:\'ADE 

240. — Is commonly used in France for the purpose of boil- 
ing fish, which imbibes from it a more pleasant flavour tlian it 
naturally possesses, and has been generall}^ adopted by English 
professed cooks : — Cut up 2 carrots, 3 onions, half a dozen 
shalots, a single clove of garlic, and put them into a stewpan 
with a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley, and a bundle of 
sweet herbs ; fry the whole for a few minutes, then add, very 
gradually, 2 bottles of any light wine or of cider. Put in a 
handful of salt, two dozen of peppercorns, the same quantity of 
allspice, and a couple of cloves. Simmer the whole together 
for It hour, strain the liquor, and put it by for use. 

This marinade, if carefully strained after the fish has been 
taken out, will serve several times for the same purpose, add- 
ing a little water each time. Fish dressed in it should simmer 
xevy gently, or rather stew than boil, as it affords to mackerel, 
fresh herrings, perch, roach, and any of the small river fish, 
the advantage of dissolving, or so thoroughly softening their 
bones, as to render them more agreeable in eating-. For large 
fish, they should be cut into steaks before being marinaded. 
Instead of the wine or cider, a quart of table-beer, a glass of 
soy, ] of essence of anchovies, and 1 of ketchup, may be used ; 
or a pint of vinegar and these sauces, fennel, chives, thyme, 
and bay-lea^'es, may be added with the wine, cider, &c. Or, 
choose a kettle that will suit the size of the fish, into which put 
2 parts water, 1 of light (not sweet) white ^vine, a good piece 
of butter, some stewed onions and carrots, pepper, salt, 2 or 3 
cloves, and a good bunch of sweet herbs ; simmer J of an hour, 
let it become cold, then boil the fish therein. Serve with 
anchovy-sauce and a so^ueeze of lemon. 

TURBOT. 

241. — Boiled. — Let it be dried immediately after it has 
been washed, for if left in the water it will become soft ; see 
that the kettle be large enough to contain the fish witliout 



214 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIV. 

injury to the fins ; rub the fish well with a lemon and a little 
salt ; have ready hard water sufficient to thoroughly cover it ; 
throw in salt in the proportion of 1 lb. to 6 quarts of water, 
with a little horseradish. Before putting the turbot into the 
kettle, make a cut down to the bone through the middle of the 
dark side, in order to prevent the skin from cracking, and see 
that the fishmonger has taken 2 joints out of the neck. 

Let it boil gently. If of a moderate size, about 8 lbs., it 
will take about 20 minutes. Slip the turbot, Avith the white 
side uppermost, upon a hot cloth on the centre of the dish, and 
serve it up with a garnish of scraped horseradish and parsley, 
and slices of lemon. 

The sauce should be made of lobster, with, if possible, the 
coral, or spa^vn. Shrimps are, however, sometimes substituted ; 
and, in France, caper-sauce is the most usual. 

Cold boiled Turhot, eaten with oil and vinegar, or v/ith a 
well-dressed salad, is excellent ; and, in summer, the addition 
of a cucumber, whether the fish be hot or cold, is thought an 
improvement. 

Stewed. — Cut a small fish into square pieces, flour and fry 
until it is brown ; after m hich drain it from the fat upon a 
hair sieve, and proceed as for stewed eels. 

A la Creme. — The remains of a cold turbot may be warmed 
either in a white sauce maigre^ a la Creme, or in Bechamel, 
or any of the rich meat sauces. The fish should be, in each 
of these modes, cut from the bones, stripped of the dark skin, 
but that of the silver side left on, and heated in either of these 
sauces, v/ithout being fried. 

JBaked. — Take a small fish, dry and flour it, make a little 
butter hot, which bnish thickly over the white side of the fish ; 
sprinkle it well with pepper and salt ; butter a baking-dish, 
lay on the fish with the v/hite side uppermost, with a glass of 
sherry, and bake for about ^ an hour. For sauce, a little 
melted butter and the gravy from the fish, 

BRILL 
242. — Is a fish so much resembling turbot in appearance as 
to be not unfrequently passed ofl' for it, and, if firm, it may 
deceive many who are not good judges ; but it is frequently 
of a woolly nature, and far inferior in value. It is narrower 
and tliinner than turbot, seldom weighing more than 10 lbs. ; 



Chap. XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. 215 

it requires scaling- on both sides, and is without those thorny- 
spines which are found on the dark side of the turbot. It is 
in season at the same time, and may be dressed in the same 
manner; it is sometimes served without the accompaniment 
of lobster-sauce ; sauce made of crabs is preferred by many 
persons. 

JOHN DORY 

243. — Is in season from summer until the close of autumn, 
at which period it is in the greatest perfection ; it is a scarce 
fish, bearing as high a price in London as the turbot. The 
skin bears a slime which should be scraped off, or it will 
impart a disagreeable odour to the dory when brought to 
table. It is very firm, eating much like the claw of lobster, 
and is usually plain boiled, but may be dressed in either of 
the modes above described : if boiled, it should be served with 
Dutch sauce, though anchovy, shrimp, or caper sauce will be 
found very delicate. A dory of 5 to 6 lbs. will take about 20 
minutes from the time of being put into cold water until done. 

Baked. — Proceed as for turbot baked, sprinkling some 
chopped parsley over the fish, and serve with Dutch sauce 
round. 

Broiled. — Dry, flour, butter, and season some small dories, 
cut some papers to fit them, screw up the edges tight, and 
broil ; serve with cold butter, or melted butter in a boat. 

PLAICE 

244. — Comes into season about May, and lasts throughou 
the remainder of the year; it is the largest of the flounder 
tribes and grows to the size of 6 to 8 lbs., though half that 
weight is more common. If in good condition, the appear- 
ance of the pale side should have a slight reddish tinge, the 
body should be tolerably thick and firm, and the eyes bright. 
It is, however, in very little estimation, and of so watery a 
nature, that it is usual to cut them in two, and wrap them in a 
towel "vvith a heavy weight upon it to extract the fluid ; the 
fish is then sprinkled with a little salt and hung up for some 
hours to dry, and never skinned. When plain boiled, it is 
served with either parsley and butter or anchovy-sauce, and 
^vill only take a very few minutes in boiling. 

It is frequently cut in pieces and fiied in bread-crumbs, 
with plain melted butter for sauce. 



1^24 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEHY. Chap. XIY 

up in a deep dish. It is thus an economical dish ; and, if tiie 
gravy be made rich, it Tvill be found very good. 

The Scotch dish called " Cropped Heads.'' — Parboil the 
roe ; mix it with double its quantity of pounded hard biscuit, 
salt, pepper, and a beaten e^'^ ; stuff haddocks' heads '^\'ith 
this mixture, and fry them in beef dripping. Prepare a sauce 
of beef gravy, fried onions and flour, a teacupful of ketchup, 
the same of pickled muscles, and add it to the heads ; simmer 
15 minutes. If a large dish be wanting, serve 2 boiled 
haddocks in the middle. 

WHITIIiG. 

252. — Their highest season is during the first 3 months of 
the year, when they spawn, but soon recover, and remain iu 
srood order throu2rhout the remainder of the twelvemonth. 

To fry. — Clean and skin them ; fasten their tails in their 
mouths ; dry and flour them ; brush over with e^^, and cover 
with fine bread-crumbs; fry a li^t-brown, and sene with 
good melted butter. For invalids they are sometimes plainly 
boiled with parsley and butter. 

Or : — Fillet 5 whitings, cut each fillet in half, flour them, 
e^ and crumb them very carefully ; fry with a little fresh 
butter, dish them up as cutlets of soles (which see), and put a 
good oyster-sauce in the centre of them, made very white, and 
rather thicker than usual. This is a most artistic mode of 
sending whiting. 

GURyJJlDS, OR GURXIJTS, 

253. — Consist of 4 or 5 difi'erent kinds, of which the Piper 
is that distinguished by fishmongers as the best, though, to 
the public, the whole species are known under the name of 
*•' Gurnets." Their flesh is white, exceedingly firm, and shells 
out into sno-^y flakes of a remarkably agreeable flavour; they may 
also be kept, without salt, for several days in very hot weather. 

From 3 to 4 lbs. is a good average weight, but the head 
is nearly as large as the rest of the body, which tapers from 
the shoulder very slenderly to the tail. Their freshness may 
be tested in the same manner as cod. 

To boil. — Boil in salt and water over a gentle fire ; serve 
with plain butter or crab-sauce. 

To fry. — Skin the fish, cut ofl'the head, tail, and fins, and 
fry the fillets in hot boiling oil or lard : drain upon a sieve, or 



Chap. XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. 225 

a folded napkin. They may be eaten with plain butter 
seasoned to the palate, but crab-sauce is considered the best. 

To hahe. — Clean, scale, and take out their insides ; then cut 
off their heads ; rub a deep dish with butter, take some parsley, 
chives, and sweet herbs, mince them fine, season with pepper 
and salt ; put a layer of the mixture at the bottom of the dish, 
then put in the fisli, and cover them with the same seasoning ; 
put some small pieces of butter on the fish, and let it melt be- 
fore the fire : lastly, cover them with bread-crumbs grated 
very fine, and put them in the oven. The sauce to be made 
as follows : — Take mushrooms, truffles, chives, and parsley ; 
shred them fine, season with pepper and salt ; moisten it with 
some fresh broth, and let it simmer over a gentle fire till the 
herbs are sufficiently done ; thicken it with a piece of butter 
kneaded in flour, and when the fish is baked of a fine brown 
pour the sauce into a dish and lay the gurnet round it. 

MULLET. 

254. — There are 2 sorts of mullet, the red and the grey ; the 
former bred in the sea, and the latter in fresh water ; both of 
small size, and comins^ into season during the heat of summer. 
The red mullet is, however, preferred, both for the delicacy of 
its flesh and the peculiar flavour of its liver, in consequence of 
which it is never gutted ; from which similarity in point of 
dressing and estimation of the trail, it has got the name of 
" sea-woodcock." Being only found on our southern coasts, 
and in hot weather, as well as requiring to be eaten quite fresh, 
they are scarce and dear in the London market. The Jersey 
mullet is the best, often growing to the weight of 2 to 3 lbs. 

To broil. — The red mullet is seldom boiled, and, although 
sometimes baked and fried, the best and most usual mode of 
dressing them is to broil them a la Maintenon ; take out the 
gills and wipe them with a dry cloth from the head to the tail ; 
flour them ; take a half-sheet of letter-paper, butter it well, 
season it with pepper and salt, rub a little butter over the 
mullet and season it ; envelop it in the paper, fasten the ends 
securely ; broil for 20 minutes ; ser^e in tlie paper. They are 
served without any otlier sauce than plain melted butter, to 
preserve the haut-gout of the liver, although that cannot be 
easily done without also retaining the other parts of the gut. 

To fry Mullet. — An excellent plan is that of drawing the 
whole gut, and boiling tlie liver separately in such a small 

l3 



226 I>IODEEN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Ceap. XIY. 

quantity of water as v/ould be required for the making- of the 
melted butter, " so that, should the livers boil to pieces in the 
process of dressing, you still retain all their valuable qualities." 
Mullets may in this manner be dressed with sweet herbs, bread- 
crumbs, and egg, and fried. 

To bake. — Only cut out the gills, without meddling- ^vith 
the liver and trail ; bake them for about -^ an hour in a mode- 
rately heated oven ; season them well, and cover them with 
chopped mushrooms, shalots, chives, or truffles, together ^\ith 
parsley and sweet herbs of any sort ; put them into a dish of 
brown gravy, with a glass or two of either white or red wine, 
basting them frequently, and, when done, serving them with a 
squeeze of lemon. In this way they are peculiarly fine. 

To steiv. — Put 3 mullet into a shallow stewpan, with a large 
wineglass of sherry and as much broth, with an onion, carrot, 
and turnip sliced, 2 bay-leaves, a blade of mace, a little parsley 
and thyme, 2 slices of lemon, and a little seasoning ; let them 
stew gently for 20 minutes ; dish them up ; strain the sauce ; 
thicken it with flour and butter ; pour it o\ er the fish quite hot. 

SEA-BBEAM 
255. — Are generally thought to be bred both in the sea and 
in fresh water, although they are of different species. The sea- 
bream, although somewhat larger than the red mullet, yet so 
much resembles it in appearance that it may be dressed in the 
same manner, and is often passed off as such by the fishmongers. 
It is in season at the same time as the mullet, and is plentiful 
on the same coasts, but is far from being so good. 

Chads are a smaller species of sea-bream, and maybe dressed 
in precisely the same way. 

31 AC REBEL 
256. — Are so well known, and in such general demand as 
an esteemed fish, thrit any description is unnecessary. Their 
season is the months of May, June, and July, after which time 
they spawn and lose condition ; but some have an after season, 
about October, vvhen they recover their flesh and flavour. They 
are so tender that they keep worse tlian any other kind of fish, 
for which reason they are allowed to be ha%\'ked on the Sunday ; 
for if not dressed within 48 hours after being caught they be- 
come putrid. Their freshness may be ascertained not only by 
the signs common to all fish, of fulness in the eye and glossi- 
ness of the skin, but also by the appearance of the bars on the 



Chap. XIV. SALT-WATER FISH. 227 

back, which should be distinctly marked blaek, those of thft 
male being nearly straight, whilst those of the female are 
waving ; an observation worth attending to, as the flesh of the 
male is better than that of the female. Their condition should 
also be looked to, for, if the body be not full and deep from the 
shoulder downwards, it is a proof that the fish has been diseased, 
or lost its roe as " shotten mackerel," which is always ill- 
tasted. They are delicate, though not rich in flavour. 

To boil Mackerel. — They should be carefully cleaned botli 
inside and out ; then washed in vinegar and water, and left to 
hang a little to dry before being put into the fish-kettle. A 
handful of salt should be put into the water, which should be 
at first cold, and only allowed to boil gently from 15 to 20 
minutes, though some prefer having the water boiling hot. 
The fish should be watched about that time, as " when the eye 
starts and the tail splits they are done, and should be imme- 
diately taken up ; if left in the water they will break." 

The most customary sauce is that of fennel, which has 
partly superseded the gooseberry, but parsley and butter is 
still in use. 

Or : — Mackerel may be boiled in a marinade made as 
follows : — Take, with some weak broth, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
\dnegar, a bundle of sweet herbs, a few small onions, or a large 
one stuck with a clove, pepper, and salt ; boil it together for 
an hour ; then boil the fish in this : take them out when ready, 
strain the liquor, and thicken it ; make it green with chopped 
parsley and fennel ; add a teaspoonful of any kind of fish-sauce, 
and send it to table. 

To souse. — If kept until cold, to be eaten on the following 
day, they should be soused in equal proportions of vinegar and 
water suflficient to cover them, and containing some whole black 
pepper, mace, and a few bay-leaves. 

Or : — Clean, bone, and cut the fish into fillets, and season 
them well. To 6 large mackerel put an ounce of ground 
pepper in equal parts of white and red, 4 cloves, a saltspoonful 
of allspice, 3 or 4 blades of mace pounded, and a tablespoonful 
of salt. Rub the mixture well in, scoring the fish, in order 
that it may be thoroughly spread. Fry them in oil till they 
are brown ; when cold, put them into a stone jar, and cover 
them with vinegar. 

To broil. — Split them down the back, rub the inside with a 



228 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XIV. 

little vinegar sprinkled with pepper and salt, flour them, broil 
on a quick fire, and serve with melted butter, parsley, fennel, 
or lemon-sauce. Or, if intended for breakfast, send up the 
f.sh plainli/ broiled without condiments or sauce, and merely 
rubbed, when done, with a bit of butter. 

To fry. — They should be cut open, and prepared for dressing 
and serving up in the same manner as for broiling ; but it is as 
well to have the back-bone taken out, and the fish powdered 
with biscuit-dust and finely-minced herbs, as if intended for 
fillets ; then put into the frying-pan, with plenty of boiling 
oil, lard, or beef dripping. 

Or : — Bone the fish ; cut each fillet in two or three pieces, 
according to the size of the fish ; dry, flour, e^^, and crumb 
them as you would soles. 

For baking, the back-bone may be taken out, and the 
fish stuffed with forcemeat, or in tlie same manner as gurnet, 
but without taking off tlie head. Pepper the inside well, lay 
butter between, flour and butter the outside, roast in a Dutch 
oven, and serve them up with lemon-juice squeezed over them, 
and a thick sauce of chopped fennel, parsley, and butter. 

To stew. — Split, bone, and cut the fish in quarters, and broil 
tliem until they are nearly half done : then put them aside ; 
take a pint of good gravy, with a little chopped fennel, parsley, 
and shalot, a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, a glass of 
ketchup, and a piece of butter rolled in flour ; stir this over 
the fire until it is of a proper thickness ; season it with cayenne 
pepper and salt, then put in the fish ; stew all very gently 
until it is done, and add a tablespoonful of thickening and a 
glass of port wine tlie last thing. 

Fillets of Mackerel. — Bone one or more mackerel ; take the 
fish off in fillets lengthwise, turning them round. Chop fennel 
and parsley, and put it in a stewpan with well-seasoned \eal 
gravy, or some fish-broth if on maigre day ; lay in the fish, 
and let it stew 10 minutes. Then take up the fillets, dish 
them, and thicken the sauce, adding to it the juice of a lemon ; 
pour it round the fish, and serve with a garnish of pickles. 

Mackerel a la maitrc dliotel. — Split 3 mackerel, cut off the 
heads and tails, and taKe out the bone. Broil them nicely a 
fine brown. Boil a dozen small silver onions ; scald a young 
cucumber, a bunch of jjarsley, and a bunch of fennel ; chop 



Chap. XIY. SALT-WATER FISH. 229 

the 2 latter, and cut the cucumber into dice. Season the 
whole, and put them into a small saucepan with a piece of 
butter ; when the butter is melted, lay the vegetables on the 
fish, and squeeze the juice of 2 lemons over them. 

Fillets of Mackerel a V Indienne. — Bone a mackerel ; cut 
each fillet in two ; melt a little butter in a frying-pan ; dry 
the fillets ; sprinkle them with pepper and salt rather freely, 
and chopped parsley ; dress them either in the oven or o\'er 
the fire ; serve with Indian pickle sauce. 

The soft roes are sometimes parboiled in a little vinegar and 
water and salt, being afterwards replaced in the boiled fish, as 
it requires less boiling than the roe ; but this is very seldom 
done, and then only for the purpose of frying them as a garnish 
for the boiled fish ; but they form a very nice dish, if there be 
a sufficient number, when dressed, cut into dice, thrown into a 
little white sauce, and patties filled with them. 

HERRINGS.— E. R. 

257. — This fish is in season from some time in May to the 
end of October. If good, their gills are of a fine red, and 
the eyes bright, as is likewise the whole fish, which must be 
stiff and firm : their firnniess, however, may be preserved, and 
the oiliness prevented, by sprinkling salt upon them, if required 
to be kept more than a day. 

Fresh heri'ings are usually broiled over a good, but not a 
fierce cinder fire, and will be improved in delicacy if steeped 
in milk for a couple of hours before being dressed, they being 
properly gutted, wiped dry, floured, and put upon a hot grid- 
iron ; they must, however, be narrowly watched by tlie cook ; 
they will be done enough in a few minutes. The heads and 
tails are sometimes cut off as a point of neatness, but imma- 
terial as regards the cooking ; they should be served quite hot, 
with plain melted butter, and are usually eaten with mustard. 

To fry. — Scale and prepare the herrings as above, but take 
out the soft roes and fry them separately, of a light brown, to 
form a garnish, and the whole well drained from the fat in 
which they have been dressed. 

Notwithstanding the prejudice against the union of two 
such strongly flavoured viands, onions are frequently fried 
along with fresh herrings, the onions being shred finely and 
()ut under the fish, or, when peeled, the layers are separately 



230 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XtV. 

unrolled, and placed over and around them. An excellent 
and very economical dish is also made by frying- them with 
sliced, or baking them with ivhole-boiled potatoes. 

To bake. — "Wash and drain without wiping- them ; season 
with allspice in fine powder, salt, and a few whole cloves ; lay 
them in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, and a 
few bay-leaves. Add vinegar and small-beer in equal quan- 
tities, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, and 
bake for a couple of hours in a slow oven. If you like, throw 
saltpetre over them the night before, to make them look red. 
Gut, but do not open them. 

Herrings are very seldom boiled, but when that is done they 
should be served with something- more savoury than melted 
butter. In France, capers are commonly added, and tomata 
sauce is not unusual. 

To smoke. — Clean, and lay them in salt with a little salt- 
petre 1 night ; then hang them on sticks through the eyes, in 
a row. Have ready an old cask, in which put some sawdust, 
and in the midst of it a heater red-hot ; fix the sticks over the 
smoke, and let them remain 24 hours. Or, if you have a 
kitchen in which wood is burnt, hang the herrings in strings 
across the chimney. 

To pot. — Take some of the above, or a dozen of recently 
cured bloaters ; soak them for a short time in scalding water, 
and strip off the skins ; cut off the heads and tails, take out 
the bones, cut the fish into pieces, and put them into a stewpan 
with a good lump of fresh butter, a little mace and either 
cayenne or white pepper. Set this on a slow fire to simmer 
until quite tender, or for some hours in a moderately heated 
oven ; then pound the whole into a mortar, make it into a 
puree of a good consistency ; put it into pots, over which run 
some clarified butter, and cover them with bladder. 

RED HERRINGS. 
Red herrings are dried when salted, but those cured in 
Ireland, Scotland, and Holland are packed and left in the 
pickle for exportation. Dutch herrings have acquired the 
highest reputation in consequence of their superior delicacy. 
They are brought to London in small casks, containing only 
a dozen each, and in Holland are always eaten raw, though 
English prejudice spoils them by oroiling. They are so highly 
cured as to make the fish quite transparent ; are generally 



Chap. XIV. SALT-AVATER FISH. 231 

steeped for an hour or two in cold milk, scored across, and 
form an excellent relish. 

258. — Choose those that are large and moist; cut them 
open and pour some boiling small-beer over them to soak i an 
hour ; drain them dry, and make them just hot through before 
the fire ; then rub some cold butter over them, and serve. 
Instead of butter, a little salad oil will add to the richness ; 
but it must be dropped on while before the fire, and in the 
smallest quantity. A very usual mode is, however, to split 
them open without any soaking, and hang them separately on 
the hooks of a cheese-toaster, by which means the soft roe will 
be browned. Some of them will have hard roes, in which 
case the belly should be carefully opened, and a little butter 
inserted between the lobes, but again close up the belly to 
more readily melt the butter. The " Yarmouth bloaters," 
whether arising from any improvement in their quality during 
their passage to London, or from the mode of curing them, are 
considered the best. 

PILCHARDS, 

259. — Though more oily than herrings, yet resemble them 
both in taste and appearance : they also come into season 
about the same time, and may be dressed, smoked, and potted 
in the same manner ; but, if not speedily consumed, they 
become rancid, and are, therefore, when fresh, seldom brought 
to London. They are caught on the coasts of Devon and 
Cornwall in large quantities, and, when salted, are chiefly ex- 
ported to the Mediteri'anean. 

SPRA TS 

260. — May be smoked, dried, and potted like henings, but 
the most common mode of cooking is to fry, or rather to broil, 
them on a close-barred gridiron, as their oiliness, when fried, 
increases the rankness of their flavour. They ought not to be 
gutted with the knife, but, if the head be cut off", the gut may 
be drawn out at the same time. They come into the London 
market on Lord Mayor's Day, and go out of season at the close 
of January. Most people eat them with salt alone, but a little 
lemon-juice, with a few grains of cayenne pepper, will be found 
an improvement. 

As they must be eaten quite hot, and are by many considered 
very nice, yet, as their odour in the parlour is disagreeable, it 
is not unusual among amateurs to have them at supper " as a 
sprat feast," at the kitchen fire.

CHAPTER XV. 
FRESH-WATER FISH. 

2Q\.— Fresh-water Fish are equally nutritious with those of 
the sea ; they are much lighter as food, and therefore easier of 
digestion ; they are, however, more watery, and it is requisite 
to use salt, in order to extract the watery particles. JEvery 
sort of fresh-water fish ought, therefore, as soon as killed and 
cleaned, to have salt rubbed inside and outside, and should 
be allowed so to remain for some time before it is cooked, 
when it should be well washed out with pure spring water, 
and wiped thoroughly dry with a clean cloth. 

If bred in ponds, it often acquires a muddy smell and 

taste ; to take off which, soaking in strong salt and water, or, 

if of a size to bear it, scalding in the same, will have the 

desired effect. 

SALMON 

262. — Has ever been looked upon as the most pre-eminent of 
all fresh-water, and indeed, by some, of every species of fish ; 
but those who have lived in the neighbourhood of salmon 
fisheries can alone have tasted this monarch of the floods in 
full perfection. It should be dressed before it has lost a tide. 
Families who purchase a whole salmon, and like it quite 
fresh, should parboil the portion not required for the day's 
consumption, and lay it aside in the liquor, boiling up the 
whole together when wanted ; by which means the curd will 
be set, and the fish be equally good on the following day. If 
new, and in season, the flesh is of a fine red (the gills parti- 
cularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish stiff. When in 
greatest perfection, there is a whiteness between the flakes, 
which gives great firmness ; by keeping, this melts down, and 
the fish becomes more rich, but suffers somewhat in flavour. 
The Thames salmon bears the highest price, both in conse- 
quence of its generally acknowledged superiority, and its great 
scarcity ; we have known 125. a pound paid for it when in the 
height of the season : that caught in the Severn is next in 
goodness, and is even preferred by some ; but the Christchurch 
salmon is by many thought to be the best. The chief supply 
to the London market is from Scotland. The Dutch salmon 
is the larg-est that comes to market, and in the early season 



Chap. XV. FRESH-WATER FISH. 23S 

fetches a great price on account of its size, some of the fish 
weighing 40 lbs. each. It requires dressing the day it is re- 
ceived from Holland, as it otherwise becomes very oily and 
soft. Those with small heads and thick in the neck are best, 
and the larger the fish the richer they are. 

The season in which salmon is the finest and most plentiful 
is from the middle of May to the close of September ; but, 
even in the same waters, there is often several months' differ- 
ence in their relative conditions ; depending chiefly on the 
time of their leaving the salt water, and how far they are ad- 
vanced towards their spawning-time : when the rudiments of 
the spawn first appear, the fish is in the best condition, and 
deteriorates considerably in goodness as it advances. When 
out of condition it loses its silvery cast on the sides, which then 
acquire a copper-coloured tinge, and the upper part a dirty 
grey ; whilst in the male, or '' kipper," the cheeks become 
marked with orange-coloured stripes, and the lower jaw grows 
out to a considerable size, forming in part a groove to the 
upper. When thus thoroughly out of season, the fish is no 
longer in a fit state to be eaten. 

263. — To Boil Salmon. — Salmon is dressed in various ways, 
but chiefly boiled in large pieces of a few pounds' weight. 
The middle piece is considered, if not the richest, yet the most 
sightly ; then that adioining the jowl ; the tail part, though 
nearly as good, being usually kept for cutlets. It requires 
great attention, and the boiling must be checked more than 
once : a piece of 4 to 5 lbs, will take nearly an hour, but if 
double that weight will not require more than 20 minutes be- 
yond that time, and if crimped, still less will be sufficient : 
let it, however, boil quickly, in the hardest water, on a strainer 
placed in a large fish-kettle, and be thoroughly done, for 
nothing is more unwholesome and disagreeable than fish that 
is under-cooked ; skim it well, or the colour will be bad ; the 
moment it is ready, lift up the strainer and rest it across the 
kettle, that the fish may drain ; cover it with a thick cloth. 

Such is the English mode of boiling salmon ; but in Scot- 
land two other methods are adopted which deserve notice : — 

1st. 27^6 Berwick receipt. — " The tail of the salmon is cut 
off below the last fin, the fish is then cut up the back, keeping 
the bone on one side, and divided into pieces of \ lb. each, 
the blood being well washed out in cold water, but the scales 



234 MODErvN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XV. j 

_ . I 

not to be removed. A pickle is then made of salt and water I 
strong enough to bear an egg, and when boiling the fish to be i 
put in and boiled very quickly for 15 minutes." ; 

2nd. The Aberdeen Fisherman's receipt. — " When the water i 
is hot put salt into it ajid stir it well ; taste it ; when strong ' 
enough to force you to cast it from your mouth, it will do ; ; 
when the water boils, put in the fish: when it boils again, i 
give 20 minutes for a salmon, and 16 for a grilse. When cut ; 
in slices an inch thick, let them boil 10 minutes. Serve in a ] 
tureen of the liquor the fish was boiled in." i 

The salmon which is only left to boil 20 minutes can, hov/- j 
ever, be only salmon-peel ; which is a small species that never j 
reaches to more than a few pounds in weight. It is, there- i 
fore, commonly boiled whole, and dressed in the form of the 
letter S, which is done by passing a large needle through the 
eyes of the fish, and tying the string under the javv', to bend 
back the jowl ; then running the needle through the thick 
part of the body, and tying it tight to the end of the tail. 

The usual sauce is that of lobster or shrimp ; and when 
those cannot be had, anchovy. The custom of sending up 
rich sauces is unknown in salmon countries ; a little lemon- 
pickle or white-wine vinegar being thought quite sufficient, 
with melted butter. When in season, cucumbers, dressed 
with oil and vinegar, is also a customary accompaniment, as 
well as scraped horseradish and parsley ; but they should be 
put on a separate plate, and not served, as common cooks 
constantly do, as a garnish round the dish : nor should any 
species of vegetable be ever served except with salt-fish. 

To preserve the remains of cold salmon, save a part of the 
water in which the salmon has been boiled, mix it with half 
the quantity of vinegar, boil it up with whole pepper, and 
when cold pour it over the fish ; but do not keep it longer than 
2 or 3 days. 

To broil. — Cut slices an inch thick ; put them into buttered 
paper and place them upon the gridiron ; or the paper niay be 
omitted, and the slices broiled upon the gridiron, rubbing the 
slices with a bit of fresh butter wrapped in gauze : sprinkle 
freely with salt ; they will be done in a few minutes, and 
should be served as hot as possible. 

Salmon cutlets should be cut from a piece of a split salmon ; 
cut them without bone about i inch thick, and rub them 



Cfia?. XY. FRESH-WATEK FISH. 235 

over with egg well beaten ; season with pepper and salt, dip 
them in cliopped herbs and bread-crumbs, fry them as you 
would a veal cutlet ; serve v/ith Indian-pickle sauce. 

Or : — Cut pieces ^ inch thick ; season them, put them in 
paper, and broil until hot through : serve with lemon only. 
This is usually eaten at breakfast. 

Or : — As in the Hebrew fashion, slice the salmon, and 
cover it with salt for 2 hours ; then dry it, and brush it over 
with yolk of eggs. Fry it in oil, and serve it cold with salad. 
Any small pieces of salmon may be served with salad, or with 
salad-sauce. 

To bake. — ^Scale it, and take out the bone from the part to 
be dressed, but fill up the cavity with forcemeat, and bind the 
piece with tape. Then flour it, rub it with yolk of egg, and 
put it into a deep baking-dish, covering it very thickly with 
crumbs of bread, chopped parsley, and sweet herbs, together 
with shrimps, if they can be got, and put into the covering a 
few small bits of fresh butter ; place it in a Dutch oven, or, 
if alread}^ boiled and thus re-dressed, heat it only before the 
fire until brov/ned. 

In the west of England salmon are often roasted tvhole in 
a cradle-spit, and thus dressed are very delicious. A Dutch 
oven is better adapted to a small bit. The piece roasted 
should be cut from the middle or tail, the jowl being, on 
account of the bones and mucilage, more fitted for boiling. 
Flour the fish well, and baste it with butter, serving it up with 
a garnish of lemon. It is most excellent when cold, and eaten 
with pepper and vinegar, being much richer than when 
boiled. It may be skinned, rubbed over with yolk of egg 
and bread-crumbs ; and this is a good way of dressing small 
pieces. 

A la maitre d^hotel. — Make a good fish gravy so strong 
that it will jelly ; add to it 2 large spoonfuls of lemon-pickle, 
and let it be well seasoned before it is strained ; then slice the 
salmon in pieces about an inch thick, squeeze lemon-juice over 
them, or pour vinegar upon the chopped fennel and parsley, 
in which they must be rolled very thickly, so as to appear 
quite green. Thicken the gravy with a little clarified butter, 
and stew the salmon gently until done. Serve up w4th green 
pickles. 

A la Genevoise. — Put a thick slice of salmon into a stew- 



2S6 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XV, 

pan with a pint of white or red wine (red is the most proper), 

2 onions, 1 carrot sliced, a faggot of parsley and thyme, 2 
bay-leaves, 2 cloves, and a dozen allspice ; pepper and salt ; 
let it boil gently : when done, strain the gravy, thicken it 
with flour and butter, add a very little anchovy-essence, and 
pour over the salmon. 

To dry Salmon, — Cut the fish down, take out the inside and 
roe, rub the whole with common salt after scaling it ; let it 
hang 24 hours to drain. Pound 3 or 4 oz. of saltpetre, ac- 
cording to the size of the fish, 2 oz. of bay salt, and 2 oz. of 
coarse sugar ; rub these, when mixed well, into the salmon, 
and lay it in a large dish or tray 2 days ; then rub it well with 
common salt, and in 24 hours more it will be fit to dry ; wipe 
it well after draining. Hang it either in a wood chimney or 
in a dry place, keeping it open with 2 small sticks. Dried 
salmon is eaten broiled in paper, and only just warmed through ; 
serve egg-sauce and mashed potatoes with it ; or it may be 
boiled, esiDecialiy the bit next the head. 

To pot dressed or imdressed Salmon. — If dressed, take the 
remains of that which is cold, pound and season it in the same 
manner as for an omelet, making it into a paste with thick 
melted butter. 

If undressed, take a large piece, scale and wipe, but do not 
wash it ; salt very well ; let it lie till the salt is melted and 
drained from it. then season it with beaten mace, cloves, and 
whole pejDper : lay in a few bay-leaves, put it close into a pan, 
cover it over with butter, and bake it in a slow oven for 2 or 

3 hours ; when well done, drain it from the gravy, and take 
out the peppercorns, put it into the pots pressed closely down 
to keep it from the air, and, when cold, cover it mth clarified 
butter. In this manner any firm fish may be potted ; and if 
the coral of a lobster, with a little of the fish, or some bruised 
shrimps, be added, they will much improve its flavour and 
appearance. 

To collar Salmon. — Split such a part of the fish as may 
be sufiicient to make a handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and 
having mixed salt, white pepper, pounded mace, cloves, and 
Jamaica pepper, in quantity to season {t very high, rub it well 
both inside and out. Then roll it tight and bandage it ; put 
as much water and ^ vinegar as will cover it, and stew it with 
bay-leaves. Cover close and simmer till done enough ; take 



CiiAP. XA\ FKESH-WATEE FISH. 227 

off the scum, and again boil the liquor, but keep it, as the 
collar may be preserved in it, and wiped dry when wanted. 
As an occasional dish for a slice at breakfast or luncheon, when 
eaten with lemon-juice or any acid sauce, it is very good, but 
not in such request as collared eel. 

To pickle Salmon. — The Newcastle method is — Put any 
quantity of salmon into an earthen jar, cover it with equal parts 
of good vinegar and v^^ater, add cayenne pepper and salt in 
proportion to the fish, and bake it in a moderate oven. This 
pickle will keep a long time, with the addition of a little fresh 
vinegar ; and if mace or cloves be added, with a few bay-leaves 
laid in the mouth of the jar, it will be found an improve- 
ment. Trout may be preserved the same way. Fish thus 
pickled must not be washed previously, but rubbed with a 
dry cloth. 

Though in London always eaten cold, yet in Newcastle it 
is not unfrequently warmed up in its pickle-liquor. 

TROUT 

264. — Are by many people thought to be a small kind of 
salmon, but, though much resembling it in outward appearance 
and delicacy of taste, they are of a distinct species, only inha- 
biting rivulets of running water, and never bred, as the salmon 
is, in the sea. They are very small, seldom exceeding 2 to 3 
lbs., and more frequently not reaching more than 1 lb. in weight. 
They come into season about the same time as the salmon, and 
when in high condition, during the height of summer, they 
present, besides the usual appearance of freshness in the eyes 
and gills, a silvery hue in the skin, while the flesh, when 
dressed, cuts into flakes of a tinge approaching to pink, and is 
justly esteemed a great delicacy. 

To bake. — "Where there is an oven it is decidedly the best, 
and also the simplest, mode of dressing all the larger sort of 
fresh-water fish. Dry the fish, lay them in a baking-dish, 
season w^ith pepper and salt, and put a little butter on them ; 
bake them according to the size ; add the juice that comes from 
the fish to some rather thick melted butter. 

To boil. — They should be wiped dry with a coarse towel, 
rubbed from head to tail, and boiled whole, putting them into 
cold water mixed \nth a small quantity of vinegar, into which 
should be also put some scraped horseradish ; let them boil 



238 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XV. 

gradually for about 10 to 20 minutes, according to size, and 
take care not to break the skin ; serve with plain melted 
butter. 

In White Sauce. — Boil the fish gently in as much water and 
light white wine, in equal quantities, as will only cover them. 
AVhen done, keep them hot while you boil the liquor with a 
bit of butter and a little flour. Meantime have ready beaten 
2 eggs, with a spoonful of cold water, and pour them and the 
sauce to and fro at a little distance above the stove till of due 
thickness, and serve the fish in it, adding a little salt. 

1)1 Green Sauce. — Beat in a mortar -j an anchovy, a table- 
spoonful of capers, 1 each of chives and parsley, previously 
minced, a good lum.p of butter, and a dessertspoonful of flour. 
AYhen the trout is ready, keep it hot while this mixture is 
boiled with the liquor, in which serve it. 

To fry Trout. — Scale, gut, and clean them ; take out the 
gills ; egg and crumb them ; then fry in lard or oil until of a 
light brown. Serve with anchovy sauce and sliced lemon. 

In the Foreign Mode. — Cover the bottom of a small oval 
paper form with a few very thin slices of fat bacon ; cut down 
the back some nicely-washed small trout, and, having removed 
the bones, lay the fish open, flat upon the bacon : sprinkle 
with chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a little mace, and 2 cloves 
finely pounded. Bake \ an hour in a quick oven, and serve 
in paper. 

Or :^^Take off the paper, leave out the bacon, and serve 
in a thick white fricassee-sauce, made of good veal broth and 
white wine, with capers. 

Trout is also good in snlad-sauce, as thus : — Fry 2 or 3 
middling-sized trout, lay them in a paper to remove the fat, 
and, when cold, serve in salad-sauce, with minced chervil and 
chives. 

PARR, CHARR, AND GRAYLING. 

265. — Parr is a still smaller species of trout, and yet more 
delicious in flavour. It is in high season during the months 
of July and August, and its freshness may be tested in the 
same manner as trout. They are very seldom boiled, but, 
when fried in the same method as trout, they form an extremely 
nice side-dish, which may be served without any impropriety 
as an entremet in the second course. 



CnAP. XV. FRESH- WATER FISH. 239 



Charr, though generally looked upon as a sort of trout, is 
yet of a distinct species ; and though known in other parts 
of Europe, is in this country confined to a few of our lakes 
in Cumberland and the neighbouring counties. It is much 
larger than the parr, being commonly from 9 to 12 inches in 
length, while the parr is of little more than half that size. Not- 
withstanding some peculiarity of taste, it is however equally 
delicate, and is now brought to London in a fresh state. " The 
best way of dressing it is baking, but it is chiefly brought to 
table in a potted state, and is sold at a high price, the dealers 
imitating it with every kind of small trout. The best season 
for them is from July to October, but they continue in good 
order until their time of spawning, in the months of November 
and December. 

Grayling, like charr, is only to be found in a few counties, 
which is to be regretted, as, being a fine fish, it forms a good- 
sized dish for the head of the table, often arriving to the weight 
of 3 to 5 lbs., though 2 to 3 lbs. is more common. It has also 
this advantage for those who have an abundant supply of all 
these sorts of fish, that it comes into season when the trout is 
going out. 

All the above fish may be dressed in the same manner, and 
their freshness tested in the same way, as trout. Perhaps, when 
very small, as nice a way as any is to split them at the back, 
and oil them over without any further trouble than seasoning 
them with a little pepper and salt, and putting them a few 
minutes before dinner-time upon the gridiron to broil, serving 
them without any other sauce than a squeeze of lemon, and 
placing them head and tail together. 

STURGEON 

266. — Is, in the north of Europe, and in some of the States 
of North America, almost as common as salmon is in many of 
our English rivers, and grov/s to a much larger size. Here it 
is so seldom found as to be held a royal fish, and when taken 
in the Thames is always presented by the Lord Mayor to her 
Majesty. We should not therefore have thought it necessary 
to mention the modes of dressing it, were it not that we shall 
probably soon have it in a fresh state, by means of our steam- 
boats. 

In Russia and some parts of Germany, where sturgeon is 
common, the usual mode of dressing is to stew it in wine ; for 



240 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XT. 

it is a coarse sort of fish, somewhat resembling dark-coloured 
vealj and requiring strong high-fiavoured sauce. 

Sturgeon a la Kusse. — When the sturgeon is cleaned, 
lay it for several hours in salt and water ; take it out an hour 
before it is wanted, rub it well with vinegar, and pour a little 
over it ; then put it into a fish-kettle, cover it with boiling 
water, 1 oz. of bay-salt, 2 large onions, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Stew it in common wine, or strong ale, until the bones 
will separate easily ; then take it up, remove the skin, flour 
it, and place it before the fire to brown, basting the fish well 
with butter. Serve up with a rich sauce made of beef-gravy 
and red wine, highly seasoned with spice, and a garnish of 
pickles. 

In England they are usually cut into slices an inch thick, 
and fried : then pour off the fat, flour the pan, and pour boil- 
ing water into it ; put the fish into a stewpan with this gravy, 
an onion and sweet herbs, pepper and salt ; let it stew until 
quite tender ; strain the sauce, squeeze the juice of a lemon 
into it, and serve it up. Sturgeon may be baked or boiled, but 
the above way of dressing is one of the best ; and the collops 
are better than those of either ling or halibut. 

Caviar is the roe of the sturgeon. When eaten fresh it much 
resembles the flavour of oysters ; and when accompanied with 
lemon-juice and pepper, without any kind of dressing, is usually 
served as a whet to the appetite before the soup. What we get 
in this country is, however, always either dried into cakes or 
potted and salted. 

To stew Sturgeo7i. — Cut the fish in slices l-^- inch thick, dip 
them in vinegar, dry them well, flour, and broil them : then 
flour and lay them in a stewpan with some good broth, and let 
them stew gently until perfectly tender ; thicken the gravy 
with butter or cream, add a spoonful of Harvey's sauce, ^ a 
glass of wine, and serve with capers strewed over the top, and 
garnished with slices of lemon. 

To roast. — Put a good-sized piece in a large cradle-spit 
(5 or 6 lbs. will make a handsome dish for the head of the 
table) ; stuff it with forcemeat ; keep it at the fire for 2 or 3 
hours, but remove the skin ; cover it with crumbs of bread, 
and brown it with the salamander ; baste it constantly with 
butter, and serve with a good brown gravy, an anchovy, a 



Chap. XY. FRESH-WATEE FISH. 241 



squeeze of Seville orange or lemon, and a glass ol'sheiTy boiled 
up, and poured into the disli. 

Sturgeon Cutlets. — Cut in slices \ inch thick ; dry, flour, 
and egg them ; dip them in crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
parsley, and thyme ; fry them, and serve with Indian pickle, 
tomata, or piquant sauce. 

CARP AND TENCH 

267. — Are rather pond than river fish 5 and although con- 
sidered of the same species, are yet widely different in both 
size and flavour — the carp arriving, in a long course of years, 
to more than 50 lbs., while the tench seldom, reaches so 
much as a tithe of that weight. The flavour of carp also de- 
pends wholly on the v/ay in which it is dressed, v/hile the 
tench possesses naturally a very delicious degree of richness. 
There is also this rather extraordinary difference, that, while 
carp are preyed upon by pike and perch, the tench is never 
attacked by either, owing, as it is supposed, to a slimy sub- 
stance in the skin. Being of similar habits, they both spawn 
in June, soon after v/hich they recover, and are again in good 
order in the month of August. They, however, bury them- 
selves in the mud during the period of winter ; and from 
thus living in slime, the flesh often contracts a disagreeable 
muddy flavour, which cannot be removed until the fish is kept 
alive for some days in pure water, and this can only be done 
by persons who have ponds of their own in which to change 
them. The odour will not exist long after the breaking up of 
winter ; but if then not quite free from it, the best way is to 
insert a large piece of bread into the belly of the fish while 
being dressed, and removing it when quite done. 

The head of the fish is looked upon as the best j)art, and 
next to that is the back ; but the merits of the carp must ever 
depend more on the goodness of the sauce than the richness of 
its flesh. 

The Crucian Carp is a diminutive species, which is some- 
times passed off" as being of the genuine sort, though utterly 
worthless. 

To boil Carp or Tench. — Clean and scale them, and take 
out the gills, as they are always muddy ; raise the back-bone, 
and rub in some salt ; then let it lie in some strong salted 
spring water for a couple of hours, after which wash it out in 

M 



242 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XV. 

clear spring water, then put it into boiling water with a good 
handful of salt, and, if it be of a moderate size, let it boll from 
15 to 20 minutes with the milt or roe. Garnish with parsley 
and slices of lemon, and serve up melted butter with fish- 
sauces. 

Carp boiled '' au bleu" — Draw the carp and clean it well, 
but do not scale it. Split it in half ; then cut it in pieces 
large enough for serving up ; lay them on a dish with the scales 
undermost, and the milt at top, and pour over each some 
scalding vinegar : add only water enough to just cover the fish, 
and put into it 2 or 3 onions with cloves, some scraped horse- 
radish, whole pepper, allspice, and a good handful of salt. 
"When the water boils lay the pieces in it, and let it boil for -^ 
an hour, taking care to skim it well whilst boiling. 

To stew Carp. — Clean the fish thoroughly, and dry it well 
on a cloth, dredge it with flour, and fry it of a light colour ; 
then put it into a stewpan, with equal parts of wine and water, 
a tablespoonful of lemon pickle, the same of walnut ketchup, a 
teaspoonful of mushroom powder, and a little cayenne pepper: 
add a large onion stuck with cloves, and a stick of horse- 
radish. Cover the pan closely to keep in the steam, and let 
the contents stew over a stove very gently until the gravy is 
reduced to a quantity sufficient only to cover the fish ; then 
take it up, strain the gravy, thicken it, and add it to the fish. 

In cleansing the carp, wash out the blood with a little 
vinegar, which save ; then split and cut the fish into pieces, 
which fr}^ with the roe in the stewpan, until nicely brown ; 
then add the vinegar and blood, 2 or 3 large onions stuck with 
cloves, some v/hole pepper, cinnamon, allspice, salt, lemon- 
peel, and a slice or two of lemon ; close the lid, and let the 
contents stev/ gradually, taking care to skim it well. When 
done, take out some of the liquor, and season with shalot and 
chili vinegar, soy, anchovies, and ketchup thickened with a little 
flour ; add ^ pint of port wine, and serve it up ; garnish with 
sippets. 

Or : — Cut off the head, tail, and fins ; season the carp with 
salt, pepper, and powdered mace, both inside and out ; rub 
the seasonmg on very well, and let the pieces lie in it an hour; 
then put them into a stewpan with a little parsley chopped fine, 
a whole onion, a little sweet marjoram, a teacupful of thick 
cream or very rich milk, and a lump of butter rolled in flour. 



Chap. XV. FRESH-WATER FISH. 943 



Pour in sufficient water to cover the carp, and let it stew ^ an 
hour. 

If to the above be added i pint of white wine in which 
the yolks of a couple of eggs have been beaten up v/ith a lumj) 
of sugar of th© size of about a walnut, and a grating of nutmeg, 
it will greatly improve the sauce. 

To sfeiv Tench. — Scale and clean : take care of the roe, &c. ; 
lay the fish in a stewpan with a rich beef-gravy, an onion stuck 
with cloves, some mace and allspice, with a dessertspoonful of 
Jamaica pepper ; simmer, closely covered ; when nearly done, 
add 2 anchovies chopped fine, a dessertspoonful of made mus- 
tard, some Avalnut ketchup, and as much curry-powder as will 
add a high flavour to the fish ; thicken the sauce v.ith flour, if 
that be not sufficiently done with the curry -powder, and reduce 
it with a couple of glasses of port wine. Let the gravv boil a 
few minutes, then add a spoonful of soy. Serve with sippets 
of fried bread, the roe fried, and a good deal of horseradish 
and lemon. 

To fry Carp and Tench. — You may safely employ precisely 
the same methods as those used for dressing trout ; or cut 
fillets from them, which wrap in buttered paper with all sorts 
of pot-herbs, minced shalot, chives, and mushroom, and put 
these envelopes upon the gridiron. The papers may either 
be taken off, and the cor^ents made into one, and served with 
caper-sauce, or left on; and if ma:lt.: stna;! f^nor.g'n for \ •i\:-^}r- 
person, each may be helped separately, and the tiiiet eaten witi: 
a squeeze of lemon. Ihe tench is better in this way than 1^ 
carp, as being of a richer nnture. 

To dress the Roe of Carp. — 11 suouid be a little salted, d/: ! 
boiled in vinegar ; then cut into small pieces, seasoned with 
spice, and made up into cakes with bread-crumbs and minced 
lemon-peel. They may be either put into scallop-shells and 
heated before the fire, or baked in a Dutch oven. 

A la Chamhord. — Let a whole carp, with the roe, be stev/ed 
in the usual way : when done skin the fish, and lard it with 
bits of bacon, putting it before the fire, or in the oven, to 
brown ; but take out the roe, and make it into balls, to be 
fried with forcemeat. Then make any seasoned sauce you 
choose, either white or brown, and serve it under the carp,

THE FRESH-WATER BREA3I 

268. — Is often found in the same waters as the carp, and 
commonl}^ attains the size of 2 to 3 lbs. weight. Their highest 
condition is from Midsummer to Michaelmas, and they may 
be dressed in the same manner as carp, but are not so good. 

PIKE, 

269. — Or Jack, as country people call it, is a ravenous fish 
which preys upon the smaller species which inhabit our streams, 
and lives to a great age, being sometimes found of the weight 
of 40 to 50 lbs. They are, however, more esteemed when not 
more than about 8 or 10. They spawn in March or April, and 
are in the best condition from Michaelmas to FebruarJ^ 

Pike, although a dry fish, and therefore much indebted to 
stuffing and sauce, is yet better flavoured than carp, and is 
much improved by rubbing a little salt dov/n the back-bone 
the day before using. In cleaning it, the roe should be 
carefully extracted, as it is a strong purgative, and the fish 
should be left for an hour or two in vinegar before being 
dressed. 

To boil Pike. — Scale it, and stuff it through the gills ; or 
open as near the throat as you can, and, after well cleaning, 
stuff* it with the following : — Grated bread, herbs, anchovies, 
oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, ^ pint of cream, 4 yolks of 
eggs ; mix all over the fire till it thickens, then put it (as a 
pudding) into the fish, and sew it up. Boil it, and when the 
fish is ready take a large cup of rich broth, with a dessert- 
spounful of essence of anchovy, the same of soy, and a squeeze 
of lemon, some butter rolled in flour, and, boiling it up, pour 
it into the dish. 

Or : — Having salted it for a day or two, boil it for 26 or 3C 
minutes, and serve it with a sauce made of good bouillon, fried 
onions, parsley and allspice, thickened with mustard, or with 
egg-sauce and parsnips. 

If stewed, the above materials may be put into good gravy 
■\vith a glass or two of wine. Small jack also eats well cut into 
fillets and fried, or cut in pieces and stewed as eels. 

To bake. — Take a large fish, stuff it with forcemeat, skewer 
it round, flour, and lay it on an earthen dish, with pieces of 
butter on the top, and a sprinkling of salt ; send it to the oven. 
A large pie v/ill take an hour in baking. When removed 



Chap. XY. FRESH-AVATEE FISH. 245 

from the oven, the dish will be found full of gravy. Put to a 
sufficient portion for the sauce 2 anchovies finely chopped, a 
little grated lemon-peel, a glass of wme, Heading sauce, or 
lemon-pickle, and make it as thick as cream with Hour and 
butter, adding capers if desirable. 

A pike of 4 lbs., cut in slices, and crimped like codfish, and 
then fried, is as good eating as any fresh-water fish that comes 
to table. The teeth of the pike are peculiarly sharp, and ha^'e 
been known to tear open the hand in a frightful manner. 

PERCH 

. 270.— Are in season from the latter end of May till the be- 
ginning of February, during which time their condition may 
be ascertained not only by the rosy freshness of their gills, 
but also by the glowing appearance of the golden tinge upon 
their back and silvery white upon the belly. They are seldom 
found in our markets of more than 1 lb. in weight. They may 
be dressed in the various ways employed for trout, having first 
cut off the powerful spines with which the back is armed, and 
carefully scraping off the scales. The most usual, however, is 
the Dutch mode of stewing them, called — 

WATER ZOUTCHEE, 

271. — -^Hiichmaybe made of carp, tench, perch, and floun- 
ders, but the two latter are much the most usual. In Holland 
they are almost in^'ariably simply boiled in a small quantity 
of water, with a large handful of parsley, and served up in a 
tureen filled Avith the vrater in which they have been boiled. 
They are eaten with bread and butter, the bread being made 
of rye, and not, as in London " brown bread," of wheaten 
br^n. 

JVater Suclie. — Take a few parsley-roots, cut them in strips 
as for soup Julienne, about an inch long and about a sixteenth 
square ; put these to boil in a little salt and water ; wlien done 
throw in a handful of small sprigs of parsley ; when tliat boils 
put in the fish ; when done serve in a deep dish, putting suffi- 
cient liquor, and the roots and the parsley. 

The mode employed at the Cape of Good Hope is to make 
a fine onion sauce ; add to it a bunch of parsley cut in pieces, 
and the same of sorrel, with pepper and salt ; put in the fish, 
and boil the whole together 



246 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XV. 

SHAD AND BARBEL 

272. — Are both common to the Thames, but are so indif- 
ferent in quality that they seldom appear at any good table ; 
for although, if well stewed, they may be made good dishes, 
yet that can only be done by the excellence of the sauce, and 
the hsh is not worth the expense of making it. The latter, 
indeed, though fished for by anglers for the sake of amusement, 
is very generally thrown away when caught, and its roe is con • 
sidered to be poisonous. The former may, however, be broiled, 
after being well basted in oil, peppered and salted, and eatea 
either v/ith oil and vinegar or with sorrel-sauce. 

EELS. 

273. — There is a greater difference in the goodness of eels 
than of any other fresh-water fish. The true silver eel is 
caught in the Thames ; and those caught in the Colne, the 
AVandle, or any of the running streams having a gravelly 
bottom, are always good. The Dutch eels sold at Billingsgate 
are very bad; and those in ponds have usually a strong muddy 
flavour. 

They are in season the whole year round, excepting the 
months of April and May, and when in high condition have a 
bright, glossy appearance on the back, and a brilliant white 
on the belly, from which they have acquired the name of 
'■ silver eels ;" though another sort, called the " grig," is 
nearly as good. The silver eels grow to a large size, and tho 
larger they are the better they are thought to be, but a fish 
of 2 to 3 lbs. weight must be considered very fine. Unless 
fully ^ lb. in weight they are hardly worth purchasing, except 
for the purpose of enriching fish-stews or making small eel- 
patties. 

Preparatory to most modes of dressing, they should be w'ell 
cleaned, gutted, and skinned, the heads and tails cut off", and 
tlie rest of the fish cut into short pieces of 3 to 4 inches in 
lenscth. and left for an hour or two in salt water." 

^ " The best way to hill an eel is to divide the spine just behind tlie head, 
without severing it from the body, when the fish will die almost instanta- 
neously" {Piscator, p. 38). — " To shin eels in the most easy manner, firat 
cut through the skin all round, just below the gills, with a sharp knife, then 
stick either an iron skewer or the prong of a stout fork through the liead 
above, and so holding on by that part with your right hand, take a coarse 
towel in your left hand, and gi*asping the fish tightly below where you have 
tut th"Ough the skin, you may strip it off as easy as a stocking "(/6. p. 162). 



OiiAr. XV. FEESH-WATER FISH. 247 

7b boil Eels. — They should be of a good size, prepared as 
above, dried, floured, and boiled in salt and water, -with a 
good deal of parsley, for about -J- an hour, or until tender ; 
then served with parsley and butter, of which a portion may be 
thrown over them, and they may l3e garnished with scraped 
horseradish. 

Or : — If, in lieu of parsley, the rind of a lemon, pared very 
thin, be boiled with the eel, and this boned and left cold, then 
covered with transparent calf's-foot jelly, it will form an ele- 
gant little supper-dish. 

To fry Eels. — Skin clean and wash the eels; take out the 
bones ; lay them on a cloth ; dry, flour, egg, and crumb the 
inside only ; fry in hot lard. 

To broil. — The same process may be adopted by merely 
changing the frying-pan for the gridiron, and wrapping the 
eels in buttered paper. Turn them frequently, and take them 
up when quite brovvn. 

Some persons, indeed, prefer the skin to be kept on, as it 
retains the oily richness of the fish, which, when stripped of its 
skin, is deprived of some portion of its mellowness. The skin 
is, of course, not eaten ; but the fish itself is certainly rendered 
more delicious, and if taken with acid sauce, or the mere squeeze 
of a lemon, is well worth the trial. The eels should be tho- 
roughly done ; and if of a large size should be parboiled previous 
to being either fried or broiled. 

To steiu Eels. — Cut the eel in pieces ; put it into a stewpaii 
with ^ pint of port wine and ^ pint of gravy, 1 large onion 
cut in slices, 2 blades of mace, 3 bay-leaves, a few corns of 
allspice, 2 cloves, 2 slices of lemon, a little parsley and thyme, 
pepper and salt, and let it simmer gently over the fire until the 
eels are done ; then strain the sauce, thicken with flour and 
butter, and add anchovy-sauce and ketchup. 

Or : — Cut the eels in pieces, fry them a little until they are 
a fine brown ; let them remain until cold ; take an onion, a 
little parsley, a leaf of sage chopped very finely ; put them in 
some gravy, with a clove, a blade of mace, pepper and salt, a 
glass of port wine, and a little lemon-juice ; strain the sauce, 
and thicken it with butter and flour, adding a little anchovy 
essence and ketchup ; stew the eels until they are tender. 

Or : — 'Take a pint each of port wine and beef-gravy, with 
a few fried onions sliced and 7 lb. of butter, and let the eels 



248 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XV. 

Btew in it for i an hour, carefully stirring, and having previ- 
ously seasoned it with spice, soy, and ketchup. 

£JeIs stewed in the French way. — Skin the eels, and skewer 
them round ; put them into an earthen pan with all sorts of 
roots cut small, a few peppercorns, cloves, and a little salt, 
about a pint of vinegar and ketchup, with as much broth : bake 
them 1 hour in the oven uncovered with pie-crust, and in the 
mean while thicken the stock with some good cream flavoured 
with a grate of nutmeg. The other modes are more in the 
difference of sauce than the methods of dressing, though put 
under various names. 

Eels spitchcoched. — Split the eels down the back, but do 
not skin them ; wash, dry, and flour them ; spread on the inside 
a little butter, then egg them, and strew rather thickly parsley, 
thyme, marjoram, and lemon-peel, all finely chopped ; season 
with pepper, salt, a little cayenne, and a very little nutmeg ; 
dip them in bread-crumbs, cut them in pieces, and broil them 
of a light brown ; serve with melted butter. The proportions 
should be marjoram 1 part, lemon-peel 2, thyme 3, and parsley 
4 parts. 

2b roast cm Eel. — The mode directed by old Izaak Walton, 
as mentioned in his Life, is so quaint and characteristic, that we 
give it here : — " First wash him in water and salt ; then pull 
off his skin below his vent or navel ; having done that, take 
out his guts as clean as you can, but wash him not ; then give 
liim 3 or 4 scotches with a knife, and then put into his belly, 
and into those scotches, sweet herbs, an anchovj^, and a little 
nutmeg grated, or cut very small, and mixed with good butter 
and salt. Having done this, then pull his skin over him, all 
but his head, which you are to cut off, to the end you may tie 
his skin to the part where his head grew, and it must be so 
tied as to keep all his moisture within his skin ; and having 
done this, tie him with tape or packthread to a spit, and roast 
him leisurely, and baste him with salt and water till his skin 
breaks, and then with butter ; and having roasted him enough, 
let what was put into his belly and what he drips be his sauce." 
To which we would add — 

Chop as small as possible 2 large spoonfuls of capers and 2 
"tmvashed anchovies : put them into a saucepan with i lb. of 
butter, 2 spoonfuls of water boiling hot, and 1 of caper-vine- 



y* 



Chap. XV. FEESH- WATER FISH. 249 

gar : shake tlie pan over the fire until all be completely mixed, 
and serve it separately as sauce. 

LA3IPREY, 

274. — Though but little known in London, are rather plen- 
tiful in the neighbourhood of Worcester, and thence frequently 
sent, as presents, to various parts of the kingdom. 

To stew Lamprey. — After cleaning the fish carefully, re- 
move the cartilage wliich runs down the back, and season with 
a small quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and allspice ; 
put it into a small stewpot, with as much strong beef-gravy, 
and madeira or sherry, in equal quantities, as will co\er it. 
Cover close : stew till tender, then take out the lamprey and 
keep it hot, while you boil up the liquor with 2 or 3 anchovies 
chopped, and some flour and butler ; strain the gravy through 
a sieve, and add lemon-juice and some made mustard. Serve 
with sippets of bread and horseradish. When there is spavrn 
it must be fried and put round. 

It will take twice as much stewing as an eel of the sam.e 
size ; and if to be either fried or broiled, it ought to be first 
partially boiled. 

miELTS, 

275. — Though not strictly ^' fresh-water Jish^'' ^yq. caught in 
large quantities in the estuaries and rivers that discharge them- 
selves into the British Channel ; but those found in tlie Thames 
and Med way are the best. They are in season from the 1st of 
Kovember until the end of May, after which time they are 
protected by law. They are a small fish ; if good, are of a 
fine silvery hue, are very firm, have a refreshing smell, like 
cucumbers newly cut, and are mucli used as a garnish to 
turbot and boiled cod ; but they are also excellent when eaten 
alone and simply fried in lard or oil, without any other sauce 
than a squeeze of lemon, as any other addition destroys tlie 
delicacy of their flavour. They should be perfectly fresh, and 
this can be readily ascertained by the redness of their gills 
and the J^ulness of the eyes, which, if sunk, show that they are 
stale. 

They are always dressed whole ; and in gutting them they 
should be as little handled as possible, nor should they be 
washed, but merely wiped gently with a towel and dusted with 
flour, then egged and crumbed.

250 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVL 



IFHITE BAIT. 

276. — Have an iron frying-pan about 4 inches deep ; put 
into it lard sufficient to cover it about H inch. Lay a cloth 
on the dresser, spnjad over it a quart of flour ; take a couple 
of handfuls of the white bait out of the v/ater, and sprinkle 
them thinly on the flour ; put the whole into a sieve, sift the 
flour from the white bait, whip thein into the boiling lard ; 
when crisp take them out ; sprinkle a little salt over them ; 
serve with brown bread and butter, cayenne, and lemon. 

ROACH, DACE, AND GUDGEON, 
277. — Come in about midsummer, and are to be had for 5 
or 6 months. The roach is the largest, and is sometimes baked 
for hours in a slow oven, with vinegar and water seasoned with 
mace and allspice, and covered with bay-leaves ; or stewed in 
layers with sliced onions, to improve its insipidity. 

Gudgeons, though very small, are nicely flavoured, but are 
seldom used in any other manner than fried as a garnish to 
boiled fish. All these small fry may be dressed in the same 
manner as smelts. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

SH E L L - F I S H. 

278. — Although crabs and lobsters may be seen at the 
fishmongers' the whole year round, they are yet only in high 
season and plentiful from the month of April till the close of 
October. They should be always purchased alive ; for many 
are found dead in the cobles in which they are brought from 
Norway, and are then boiled and sold under pretence of their 
ha\'ing been just killed. 

If lobsters have not been long taken, the claws will have a 
strong motion when you put your finger on the eyes and press 
them. The heaviest, if of good size, are the best, but the 
largest are not the best. When you buy them ready boiled, 
try whether their tails are stifi*, and pull up with a spring ; 
if otherwise, they are either watery or not fresh. The " cock' 
lobster,^' as the male is called, is known by the narrow back 
part of Iiis tailj and the two uppemiost fins within it are stiff 



Chap. XVI. SHELL-FISH. 251 

and hard ; but those of the hen are soft, and the tail broader. 
The male, though generally smaller, has the highest flavour ; 
the flesh is firmer, and the colour, when boiled, is a deeper red ; 
but the female has that fine coral ^so highly prized by cooks 
for the improvement of their sauces, which appears wdth the 
rudiments of the spawn. 

To hoil Lobsters. — Put them alive, Vvitii tlieir claws tied 
together, into the water v, hen boiling hot, and keep it so until 
the fish is done, which, if of a pound weight, v.ill take about 
J of an hour, and if larger will require not quite the same pro- 
portion of time, for if boiled too long the meat will be stringy. 
Many people are shocked at the apparent cruelty of thus kill- 
ing them, but death takes place immediately, and life cannot 
be taken away without pain. 

When sent to table to be eaten cold, the tail and body should 
be split from end to end, the claws cracked, but not unshelled, 
and the meat may be made into salad, or mixed in such manner 
as each person pleases, and many persons add a teaspoonful of 
white powdered sugar, thinking that it gives a mellowness to 
the whole. It is scarcely necessary to mention that the head 
of a lobster, and what are called the " lady-fingers," are not to 
be eaten. 

To stew Lohsters. — Take tlie meat out of tlie shells of 1 or 
2 boiled lobsters. Put the shells into a pint of water with 
some whole pepper, salt, and a little mace. Let it boil till all 
the goodness is extracted froi# the shells ; then strain it. Mix 
with a little cream, or thin melted butter, the rich portion of 
the lobster, and the coral ; add a small quantity of lemon-juice 
and 2 tablespoonfuls of wine, mix it with the gravy, and v»'arm 
the lobster in it ; a few minutes will suffice. 

Or : — Cut the meat of a boiled lobster into pieces, and put 
them into a covered metal dish v/ith a bit of butter, 2 large 
spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, 1 of soy or walnut-ketchup, a 
little salt and cayenne, with a glass of port wine, and warm it. 
If there be a If imp under the disii, you may do it at your own 
table within a fev,' minutes. 

Another mode. — Take the meat of 2 lobsters, mince it small, 
and put it into a pint of beef-soup. Let it stew a little ; 
thicken it v/ith a piece of butter rolled in flour ; add a glass of 
white wine, with a little pepper ; add salt and nutmeg, a spoon- 
ful of ketchup, 1 of anchovy, and 1 of lemon-juice. Let the 



252 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYI. 

whole stew together, and serve up, garnishing the dish with 
the small claws. 

To fricassee Lobster. — Parboil it, extract the meat from the 
shell, and cut it into small, pieces ; season it with white pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, and put it into the stevrpan, w4th as much 
cream or richly-made white sauce as will cover it. Keep the 
lid close, set the pan on hot coals, and stew it slowly for about 
as long a time as it was previously boiled. 

Croquettes of Lohster. — Chop the meat of a lobster, add to 
it fine bread-crumbs (in the proportion of about one-fourth the 
(juantity of lobster), and a spoonful of white sauce or a little 
cream ; season with a little anchovy sauce, pepper, salt, very 
little nutmeg, and lemon-juice. Make the w^hole hot : the 
seasoning should be rather savoury. Remove it from the fire, 
stir in the yolk of an eg^, lay it out on a plate to cool ; make 
it up in shapes either round, rolls, or flat, brush it over witli 
egg, and dip in bread-crumbs ; fry in hot lard ; garnish with 
fried parsley. 

Lohster Fritters. — Pick out the meat, chop it, and warm 
it M'ith some melted butter, adding shrimps or prawns, if the 
quantity be small. Cut pieces of paste into pretty shapes, fry 
them, and serve up the lobster heaped upon them, which is 
sometimes more convenient than making into patties. If, 
liowever, the pieces be put into the paste, which is then rolled 
around them, they make nice fritters. Or, if put into a sliape 
and ^^^armed before the fire, and 'Browned with the salamander, 
they will make a very pretty side-dish. 

Miroton of Lohster. — Take the meat of a good-sized lobster, 
and put it into a mortar, with the crumb of a Frencli roll 
soaked in cream ; pound them well together ; then add tlie 
yolks of 3 eggs, and some fat of ham also pounded ; season it 
with pepper, salt, and a little mace. Add the whole of an 
■2^g beaten up to a strong froth, and take care that the spawn 
of the lobster should have been pounded with the rest. Line 
a mould with slices of fat bacon, put in the ingredients, and 
boil it for If hour. Serve up in a disli witli lobster-sauce 
round it. 

Scalloped Lohster. — Take out the meat from 2 middling- 
sized lobsters, put it into a mortar, pound it with a little salt 
and some cayenne pepper, then mix it with fine wdiite sauce; 



Chap. XYI. SHELL-FISH. 2b^ 

,}iave the sliells ready, that is, the tails split, and the 2 bodies, 
making in all 6 pieces, which are enough for a dish. Put the 
lobster into the shells, cover with bread-crumbs, and put the 
shells either into an oven or upon a gridiron. Serve it very hot. 

Or : — Pound the fish in the above manner, adding only a 
very little salt with nutmeg, instead of cayenne, and beat it up 
with thick cream ; it may then be either put into pufF-paste for 
patties, or served up as a fricassee. 

These are all excellent dishes, and will form an elegant 
remove for a second course. 

279. — Curri/ of Lobster. — Take a fine lobster, break out the 
meat, then put on the body in suflftcient good broth to make 
the sauce for the curry. Slice a moderately large onion, put 
it in a stewpan, with an ounce of butter, a little parsley and 
thyme, and a slice of lemon ; sweat them over the fire ; then 
put in a heaped tablespoonful of curry-powder, and rather 
less than half that quantity of flour ; when the flour, &c. is 
tlioroughly cooked, strain tlie gravy from the body and stir it 
in by degrees. Let it boil for I of an hour ; rub through a 
sieve ; season with a little salt and lemon-juice ; put in the 
meat, let it stand warm for an hour, then bring it to the boi], 
and serve. 

PEA TFAS AND SHRIMPS. 
280. — Both shrimps and prawns fonn a very common relish 
when eaten cold at the l^reakfast-table ; and "\\ hen dressed hot 
the latter are celebrated for the flavour of their curry, as the 
former is in general use for the makin"- of sauce. Thev also, 
as v/ell as lobsters, make excellent fritters and rissoles. 

To steic. — Pick the meat out of the shells, put it into a 
f-tewpan with h pint of good gravy and a glass of claret ; add 
an onion minced fine, some sweet herbs, and a little pepper 
and salt. Let them stew gently until quite tender ; then add a 
large spoonful of mushroom ketcluip, 1 of essence of anchovy, 
and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve up hot, and garnisli 
with bread-sippets. 

If brought to table cold^ as a supj)er-dish, they will be found 
a verv delicate and elescant entrte, if served in a shape and 
(Covered with clear jelly. 

CRAB, 
281. — Tliough not so well known as the lobster, is looked 



254 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYI. 

upon by many as being a better-flavoured fish, and perliaps^ 
rather more digestible. The heaviest are usually thought to 
be the best, but those of a middling size are the sweetest. If 
light, they are water}^ ; when in perfection, the joints of the 
legs are stiff ; the shell, v/hether alive or dead, should be of a 
bright red ; and the body has a very agreeable smell. The 
eyes look dead and loose when stale, or ^^•hen the fish have 
died a natural death. They are boiled in the same manner as 
lobster, but require rather longer time ; and are most usually 
eaten cold, vrvth. oil and vinegar, prepared thus : — Pick out all 
the fish from the shell, divide it into small pieces, mixing the 
rich part well with the rest ; moisten it with salad dressing, and 
return it to the shell with an edge all round of sliced lemon. 

If hot, pick the fish out as above ; then put the meat, with 
a little nutmeg, salt, pepper, bits of butter, crumbs of bread, 
and 3 spoonfuls of vinegar, into the shell again, and set it 
before the fire. You may brown it ^^-ith a salamander, but it 
should be always served in the shell. Drj' toast should be 
served to eat with it. Remove the '" lady," as it is called. 

To stew Crabs. — Pick the meat carefully out of a large 
crab and its claws ; cut into small pieces, mix it with about 
a fourth part of bread-crumbs, and a very small quantity of 
finely shred parsley. Season it well, and return it to the shell 
v/ith some small bits of butter, enough when warmed to keep it 
moist. Squeeze the juice of a lemon over it, or a spoonful of 
lemon-pickle or acid sauce. Put a thick layer of crumbs of 
bread upon the top with small bits of butter laid all over it, 
and bake it in the shell before the fire, or in the oven. The 
shell of one crab will contain the meat of two. 

Oi' : — Boil them, take the meat out of the bodies and the 
large claws, put it into a stevrpan \^dth + pint of claret, a spoon- 
ful of shalot-vinegar, a little cayenne, some salt, and a piece 
of butter ; let them stew for an hour over a gentle fire, until 
they are almost dry. Then add a small quantity of fish-stock 
ov gravy, a tablespoonful of essence of anchovy, and a small 
piece of butter rolled in fionr. Serve with sippets of fried 
bread round the dish. 

Another way is to put the meat into a stev.-pan with \ pint 
of white wine, a spoonful of shalot or garlic vinegar, a little 
parsley and thyme minced fine, tlie yolks of 3 eggs boiled hard 
aiid minced small, and som^e salt and cayenne pepper. Let it 



Chap. XVI. SHELL-FISH. 255 

Utew gently till quite tender and almost dry; then add a piece 
of butter, stir it about for a few minutes over the fu'e, wash 
the shells, butter them, put the stewed meat into them, and 
serve on a napkin. 

SMALL CRABS AND CRAYFISH 

282. — Are sometimes made into soup, but more commonly 
plain boiled for about ^ of an hour, and eaten cold. In tlio 
lower parts of Germany they are, however, frequently eaten 
hot, with rye-bread and butter, and are there a fiavourite sup- 
per dish in the heat of summer. 

To dress Crayfish. — TTash them in cold water, then take 
one in the left hand, and with the right pull out the centre of 
the tail, to which is attached the gut of the fish ; this frexjuently 
is the cause of their tasting bitter. When the}^ are prepared, 
drop them into a marinade of water and vinegar, equal parts, 
and a glass of white wine ; season with pepper, salt, and an 
onion ; let the marinade boil when they are put in, and boil 
for 10 minutes or less, according to their size. If sent to table 
hot, serve them in a napkin, as you would chestnuts ; if cold, 
pile them up, and garnish with parsley. 

To stew. — Boil them in salt and water, pick the meat out of 
the tails, put them into a stewpan with a little butter and some 
mushrooms ; moisten them with a little fish-stock, and simmer 
a short time over a gentle fire. TThen nearly done, beat the 
yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with a teacupful of cream and a little 
chopped parsley ; let all stew together for a few minutes, stir- 
ring it all the time, and serve up in a deep dish. 

Crayfish Butter. — Take the shells of 24 crayfish, clean 
them well from skin and fibre, put them into an oven to dry, 
without burning or browning, until they can be beaten to a 
fine powder ; mix the powder very well with 3 oz. of fresh 
butter, then put it into a stewpan \Y\\h. a spoonful of hot water, 
mixing it well together ; then squeeze the whole through a 
tamis over a stewpi^i of boiling water ; skim the butter off" into 
a basin of cold water, that it may set ; when cold press it in 
a napkin. 

It forms a beautiful colouring addition to many kinds of 
dishes, fish especially, and, when mixed with the meat pounded 
after being taken from the shells, makes fine sauce.

OYSTERS m 

283. — Depend very much for goodness upon tlie beds from 
wliich they have been taken. There are several kinds : the 
" Pyfleet," " Colchester," and " Milford," are excellent, and 
the '^ native Milton " are very fine, being white and fat ; but 
others may be made to possess both these qualities in some 
degr(>e by proper feeding. The rock oyster is largest, but 
usual ly has a coarse flavour if eaten raw. 

They all come into season, according to law, on the 4th of 
August, and go out at the close of April ; or, according to 
an old saying, " so long as there is an R in the month." They 
are, however, not perfectly good until the beginning of Octo- 
ber, and should go out at the end of March. 

Although salt and water will alone preserve the flavour of 
the oysters in their greatest perfection if they be of good 
quality, yet, if thin, or appearing out of order, a sprinkling 
of oatmeal will, in the course of 2 days, tend to greatly improve 
and fatten them. When the fish is alive and strong, the shell 
closes on the knife. They should be eaten as opened, the 
flavour becoming poor if long exposed to the air. 

To scallop Oysters, — Scald the oysters in their ov.n liquor ; 
take them out separately witli a fork, so that it may not be 
necessary to wash them, beard them, strain the liquor; let it 
settle; pour off from the dregs ; thicken with flour and butter; 
season with cayenne, salt, and nutmeg. Put in the oysters, 
let them boil. Have ready the scallop-shell, buttered and 
bread-crumbed. Put in a layer of the oysters, then a few 
crumbs ; again more oysters, and then a good handful of 
crumbs for the top ; sprinkle with warmed butter, and brown 
before the fire in a Dutch oven. 

If flour and butter are objected to, the yolk of an egg and a 
little cream may be used. 

Some cooks mix with them minced shalot, or chives, and 
pot-herbs ; but these, although they may please an epicurean 
palate, will destroy the natural flavour of the oj^ster. 

Or : — Keep the oysters in their liquor, put a bit of butter 
in a stewpan, with minced parsley, shalot, and a little pepper ; 
broM'n them with a fried onion ; then add the oyster-liquor, 
strained, and a little good gravy, work them until they are of 
the consistency of sauce, but do not add flour to thicken it, 
5.S it spoils the taste of the oyster-liquor, and gi^'es them a 



Chap. XYI. SHELL-FISH. 257 



s'dddened appearance ; then toss and put in the oysters, add 
lemon-juice, and fill the scallop-shells, which may be put 
before the fire to be kept hot, but without bread-crumbs or 
artificial browning of any sort : they are an admirable addition 
to a rump-steak. 

To broil Oysters. — Take them from the shells, h 3ard them, 
and put them with their liquor into tin shapes made to imitate 
scallops, 6 in a shell (not more), with a little pepper and butter. 
Put the shells upon a gridiron over a good fire, and serve them 
when jDlump and quite hot. They are delicious this w^ay ; but 
to have them in perfection they should be cooked in the room 
where they are eaten. Squeeze a little lemon-juice over them 
when they come from the fire. 

Or : — They may be put singly in their under shells along 
with their own liquor, a little minced parsley and spice, and 
a, bit of butter, and thus put upon the gridiron, to be taken ofif 
when thoroughly heated. 

Stewed Oysters — white. — Beard the oysters, wash them in 
their own liquor, then strain it, thicken it with melted butter, 
or white sauce made of cream, not milk and flour ; season it 
with a blade of mace and a few whole peppercorns tied in a 
muslin bag. Simmer the oysters very gently, and serve up 
with sippets of bread : they will require only a few minutes, 
and if allowed to boil will become hard. 

Srown. — Wash the oysters in their liquor, and then strain 
it, add a glass of wine, 2 spoonfuls of beef-gravy, some whole 
pepper, a little salt, a piece of butter, and a spoonful of lemon- 
juice ; boil tlie whole, stirring it until it is smooth, then put in 
the oysters, and vvarm or plump them up without boiling. 

Oyster Holls. — Take about a quart of the largest and finest 
oysters you can procure, stew them in their own liquor v/ith 
some pepper, a very little mace, and some green onion chopped 
fine, thicken them with a little butter and a dust of flour when 
nearly done enough. Take 2 French rolls of the square sort 
baked in tins, cut a piece oft" the top, and scoop out the greater 
part of the crumb, fill the roll with the oysters and the liquor, 
and set them near the fire on a cnafing-d:sh filled witli hot 
coals ; as the liquor soaks in, fill them with more, or, if you 
have not any left, add a little good gravy boiling hot. 

Or : — Let them first soak, then fasten in the top, cover the 



258 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEBY. Chap. X^^. 

entire of the roll in batter, and bake it in the Dutch oven till 
well browned. 

Or : — Mince the oysters, season them only with mace and 
nutmeg, and fill the rolls up with cream or rich white sauce, 
and bake them as above : even one large roll will make a nice 
iittle dish, and is better than the smaller sort. 

Oyster Sausages may also be made of the larger kind, 
.^earded and minced small, together with a moderate quantity 
.f beef suet and bread-crumbs, to which should be added a 
forcemeat of pounded pork or veal, seasoned with spice and 
put into the usual skins. If "well seasoned, they will keep 
good for a full week : 1 lb. of beef suet shred fine, and tlie 
same quantity of forcemeat, with bread-crumbs, should be put 
to each pint of oysters. 

Or : — Take t lb. of lean beef or mutton, -f lb. of beef 
suet, 2 score of oysters bearded and scalded in their own 
liquor, then dried and all chopped together, adding bread- 
crumbs and yolks of eggs to bind the materials. Season well 
with salt, white pepper, mace, and a grate of nutmeg ; or if 
you wish to make it very savoury, leave out the mace and nut- 
meg, but add a little cayenne, with a minced shalot and a 
spoonful of garlic-vinegar. They may be either made as 
sausages, or fried into sliapes in the usual w^ay. 

3IUSCLES-E.R. 

284. — -Are '.tiore frequently eaten on the Continent than at 
English tables, but, though in little use, they are very deli- 
cious in many sauces. They are boiled or stewed in the fol- 
lowing manner : open them, put them into a pan with their 
own liquor, to which add a large onion and some parsley, with 
2 tablespoonfuls of vinegar ; roll a j^iece of butter in flour, 
beat an egg, and add to it the gravj^, warming the whole up 
very gradually. 

In France muscles are skewered upon a small skewer and 
roasted, or dipped into a thick batter and fried. 

In preparing muscles for table, care should be taken to 
destroy the beards, as well also as a small species of crab which 
is sometimes found in their shells, and which are said to be uri- 
wliolesome. They are not in season during the. summer. 

COCKLES AND PERIWINKLES, 

285. — Despicable as they may appear, make excellent sauces 
aiid even soups. (See Chap. VII.) 



CiiAr. XVI. FISPI. 259 

To boil. — It is only necessary to put them in a stewpan with 
as mucli water as will prevent the bottom from burning, as the 
liquor oozing from them will be sufficient for the purpose : 
when the shells open wide enough to extract the fish, they will 
Ve sufficiently done. 

To stew. — Clean them and wash them from the sand in 3 or 
4 waters, boil them and pick them out of the shells. To a 
pint of the fish put ^ pint of fish-stock, 2 ounces of butter, and 
some pepper and salt ; add a spoonful of flour, stirred in gra- 
dually, and simmer over a slow fire, until it is of a proper 
thickness ; add a large spoonful of essence of anchovy and one 
of mushroom ketchup. 

SCALLOPS. 

286. — To stew. — Boil them very well in salt and water, 
then take them out and stew them in a little of their liquor, 
a glass of ^^'hite wine, and a little vinegar ; add some grated 
bread-crumbs, and the yolks of 2 or 3 hard eggs minced 
email. Stew all together till they are sufficiently done, then 
add a large spoonful of essence of anchovy and a good piece of 
butter rolled in flour : or stew very gradually in a rich white 
sauce, with thick cream, until quite hot, but without being 
allowed to boil, and serve with sippets. 

Crayfish, prawns, and shrimps may all be done in the same 
manner. 

TO SCOLLOP FISH 

287. — Is in some measure to make it into a pie, as the usual 
mode is to bake it in scollops or shapes resembling the shells ; 
as thus : — 

Flake the fish, and imbed it in bread-crumbs moistened with 
thin melted butter or cream, flavoured with any approved 
sauce ; cover the top thickly \\ith bread-crumbs, lay bits of 
butter over, and bake it either before the fire or in a Dutch 
oven ; or lay the fish in the bottom of the dish, with a rich 
white sauce of cream, and cover the top only with bread- 
crumbs ; in either case season with pepper and salt, and a very 
little nutmesf and cayenne. 

UNE GRENADE, 

288. — Scrape gently the flesh of a large whiting from the 
skin and bones; beat it in a mortar 15 minutes having 



260 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVL 

scraped 2 ounces of tlie finest fat bacon, beat them together 
another 1 5 minutes ; then add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, 2 oz. of butter, a small bit of garlic chopped to a 
inash, a blade of mace in powder, and the beaten yolks of 2 
eggs, and pound a full i hour more : when to be used, mix 
well therein the fresh-beaten whites of 2 eggs, reserving a 
teaspoonful to be used as hereafter directed. Meanwhile take 
the bones and fins from 4 or 5 little red mullet, without in- 
jurmg the skin, and cut them lengthwise an inch wide ; do 
the same by a good-sized sole, having split but not removed 
any of the skin. Then stew a small veal sweetbread, a fresh 
artichoke-bottom, 8 oysters without the beard, and 2 truflfles 
cut in bits, for J of an hour in a little butter, and let it become 
cold. When all the above are in readiness, line a pan of 5 or 
6 inches in diameter with long slices of fat bacon, placed quite 
close, in the centre of which lay 4 bits of carrot, cut diamond 
shape, lengthwise ; cover the bacon with the strips of fish 
perfectly united, alternately putting the brown and white of 
tlie sole and the red of the mullet next to the bacon, and on 
these ^ the forcemeat : then put in the sweetbread, &c., which 
cover with the remainder of the forcemeat, smoothing it over 
with the back of a spoon wetted with the white of the egg- 
before directed to be preserved. Lay on it a buttered paper, 
put the cover of the pan on, and bake 20 minutes. 

When done, turn the grenade on the lid to drain, carefully 
remove the bacon without breaking the skin of the fish, and 
serve very hot, with rich veal gravy round, not over it. The 
entrails of the mullet will give additional flavour to the force- 
meat. Where they cannot be had, the red part of lobsters, 
used alternately with the bro^n and white of the sole or 
mackerel, will look beautiful. 

Grenade of Sole. — Split a fine sole downwards, take out the 
bone, and lard the inside with strips of gherkins and truffles, 
then cover one -half of tlie sole with the following forcemeat, 
which will be again covered by the remaining half of the sole ; 
fasten them together with 4 splinter skewers, and bake with 4 
or 5 spoonfuls of weak meat or fish gravy. 

Make the forcemeat of any dressed fish, crumbs of bread, 
the hard yolk of an egor, half a spoonful of boiled celery-root, 
half an anchovy, a spoonful of parsley, and half as much 
chervil, both finely minced, a little fat bacon or butter, and a 
raw egg, pepper and salt. 



Chap. XYI. FISH. 26i 

When dressed, keep the fish hot, -u'liile the gravy it ^-as 
baked in is wanned with a spoonful of caper-vinegar, and the 
same of the gherkin-liquor, to serve round it, with a few sliced 
gherkins. 

CROQ UETTES OF FISH.—E. R. 

289. — Take dressed fish of any kind, separate it from the 

bones, mince it with a little seasoning, an e^^ beaten with a 

teaspoonful of flour, and one of milk ; roll it into balls ; brush 

the outside with e^^, and dredge it well with bread-crumbs, 

fry them of a nice colour : the bones, heads, tails, with an 

onion, an anchovy, and ao pint of water, stewed together, vrill 

make the gravy. Lobsters make delicate croquettes ; in 

which case the shell should be broken, and boiled down for 

the gra\y. 

RISSOLES OF FISH.—E. R. 

290. — Pick from the bones and skin any kind of cold fish, 
weigh it, and add one-third of grated bread-crumbs, a little 
cold melted butter, a small onion, previously boiled and finely 
minced, pepper, salt, and the yolks of 2 eggs to bind it 
together. Roll out thin some trinmiings of pufi:-paste, cut it 
in 2-inch square pieces, put in the middle of each a teaspoon- 
ful of the mince ; wet, and fold the paste over them, having 
cut them out with a cutter. Egg them, and dip them in 
bread-crumbs, fry in lard, and serve dry, garnished 'vvitli 
fried parsley. See that the edges of the paste be perfectly 
closed. 

CASSEROLE OF FISH. 

291. — ^' Poisso?i rechauffe,^^ or fish which has been left 
after being dressed, and re-heated. There are almost as many 
modes of doing this, as of originally dressing the various sorts ; 
but we here only retain a few of the most simple : — 

Take any kind of cold fish, and divide it into large flakes ; 
boil 2 or 3 eggs hard, and cut them into slices ; have also some 
mashed potatoes ; butter a mould, and put in the fish, eggs, 
and potatoes, ^vith a little delicate seasoning of white pepper ; 
moisten the whole with cream, or thin melted butter, and a 
spoonful of essence of anchovies; boil the mould and turn 
it out. 

Or : — Take some fish which has been dressed, and rub it 
through a sieve ; to ^ lb. of fish allow I lb. of bread-crumbs, 
2 eggs well beaten, 1 tablespoonful of essence of anchovies, 1 
of Harvey sauce, and a little salt and cayenne pepper ; mix 



262 MODER^^ DOMESTIC COOKEIIY. Chap. XVI. 

all well together, and put it into a mould ; let it boil 7 an 
hour, and serve it with a good fish-sauce in the dish. 

Or : — Take ^ pint of good gravy, with a couple of glasses 
of wine, 2 tablespoonfuls of anchovy liquor, and 2 of vinegar, 
seasoned high with cayenne, mustard, salt, and shalot ; mince 
the fish, but do not put it in the mortar, and either warm it as 
a fricassee, and bring it up in a dish with sippets; or, put it 
into a form, piled up high in the centre, cover it with bread- 
crumbs and bits of butter, and brown it with a salamander. 

FISH TURTLE.— E. R. 
292. — For this imitation, sturgeoit is the best material, but, 
if not in season, cut some ling into handsome pieces, and fry 
it ; then boil an equal cpiantity of skate, also cut in pieces ; 
and having cleaned and soaked 2 or 3 cod-sounds, stew them 
until green with a little spinach, and cut them into pieces ; 
tlien have a sufficient quantity of good gravy, into which the 
liquor of 2 or 3 dozen of oysters has been strained ; thicken it 
with cream or butter ; put it into a stewpan with the fisli 
already named, a lobster cut in pieces, a spoonful of essence of 
anchovies, and a glass of Madeira. Warm the wliole together, 
and send it to table with a lemon garnish. The sauce to this 
dish must be very rich, and of a fine dark colour. 

FISH PA TE. 

293. — This is a pretty mode of enclosing a fricassee of fish 
with a potato wall without a crust of pastry. Mash in a 
mortar as many potatoes as you may want, with a good piece 
of butter ; then, with the bowls of 2 silver spoons, raise a wall 
of it 2-2- inches high within the rim of the dish to be used. 
Let the upper part be a little thinner than the lower ; smooth 
it ; and, after brushing it all over with eg^, put it into the 
oven to become hot, and a little coloured. Before egging it, 
the outside may be ornamented with flowers, leaves, &c., l^y 
the small tin shapes used to cut paste. 

Beat the whole of a crab picked clean from the shell in a 
marble mortar, with white pepper and salt, nutmeg, and a very 
few crumbs of bread ; warm it with a little gravy tliickened 
with cream or butter and a spoonful of wine, and, when 
thoroughly warmed, add a little lemon-juice. Pour it into 
potato walls previously baked, but not covered like a pie, and 
serve it up hot, either browning it with the salamander, or 
covering the top with fancifully arranged small claws. 



CnAP. XVI. nSH. 263 

FISH CAKE. 

294. — Cut the meat from the bones, put them, the head and 
fins, over the fire to stew for gravy, with a pint of water, an 
onion, herbs, pepper, and salt. Mince the meat, put to it \ 
part of crumbs of bread, a little minced onion, parsley, pepper, 
salt, and a veiy small bit of mace : mix well, and make it into 
a cake with white of egg and a little melted butter ; cover it 
with raspings, and fry it a pale brown, keeping a plate on the 
top while doing. Then lay it in a stewpan, with the fish 
gravy, and stew it gently i of an hour ; turn it twice, but with 
great care not to break it : cover it closely while stewing. 

Cake of dressed meat, done in the same way, is remarkably 
good. 

FISH-CUTLETS.— E. E. 

295. — Chop a considerable quantity of herbs with a small 
piece of shalot, season it with pepper and salt, and put it into 
a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter ; as the butter is melting add a 
teaspoonful of essence of anchovies. Do not allow the butter 
to more than melt, and mix the whole well together ; then cut 
any kind of white fish, dressed or raw, into handsome cutlets, 
and, when the herb seasoning is nearly cold, spread it on the 
fish thickly with a knife ; dredge the fish with bread-crumbs, 
and cook them on butter-pans in an oven, or before the fire. 
Stew a few silver button-onions, or a chopped onion, with any 
green vegetables in season, cut it into dice in a little broth, 
add nasturtiums and a little of the pickle ; keep them in the 
middle of a dish, and lay the cutlets round. 

Or : — Take any fish previously dressed, pull it in pieces, 
and mix it with a little good stock, and any fish sauce which 
may have been left from table ; spread it on a flat dish, brush 
it with egg and sprinkle thick with bread-crumbs, cut it out 
in cutlets, and fry brown. 

KEDGEREE FOR BREAKFAST. 

296. — Boil 2 tablespoonfuls of rice, add any fish previously 
cooked (salmon or turbot is preferable), and nicely picked ; 
beat up an egg well, and stir it in just before serving. Tlie 
egg must not boil. 

FRICANDELLES OFFISH. 

297. — Take any quantity of either dressed or undressed fish 
of firm quality ; skin and bone it ; mince it of the size of dice 



264 MODEllN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XVI. 

with a few anchovies, say 2 to each pound, seasoned with 
mace, cayenne, and a grating of nutmeg ; soak the crumb of 
a French roll, 1 to each pound, in milk, and beat it up with 
the yolks of 2 eggs to each roll, so as to make it into a puree, 
and put the fish into it ; warm the whole gently, and add to it 
a moderate quantity of cream. 

Put the fish thus prepared into a buttered mould, cover it 
thickly with bread-crumbs, and either bake it in a Dutch oven, 
or warm it before the fire, and brown it with the salamander. 

A few oysters are an excellent addition ; and if wine be 
used instead of imlk, the dish may be dressed in the same 
manner, but rather more highly seasoned. 

A MATELOTE OF FISH. 

298. — A matelote may be composed of various kinds offish 
all cut up ; or a particular fish dressed and served whole, with 
the matelote round it. 

Cut up into convenient sized pieces the fish you are going 
to serve, such as trout, pike, carp, tench, eels, &c. ; scald a 
dozen button- onions, peel, and put them into a ste^vpan with 
1 oz. of butter, let them brown ; then put in the fish, the 
larger pieces first, with ^ pint of red wine and an equal 
quantity of good gravy, a few bay -leaves, allspice, pepper and 
salt, a carrot and turnip sliced. When the fish is done take it 
out carefully and keep it hot. Thicken the gravy with flour 
and butter, add to it the button-onions, the same quantity of 
mushrooms, scalded oysters, arid fish quenelles, made in tea- 
spoons. Season with a little anchovy, lemon-juice, and cayenne. 
Have the sauce boiling hot, and pour on the fish. Garnish 
with crayfish. 

When required to serve a trout, sole, or any other fisli 
whole, the sauce is made in the same way, adding pieces of 
eel filleted, pieces of lobster, cockscombs, and prawns. 

A VOL-AU-VENT 
299. — Offish, of any sort, is an elegant side-dish when pre- 
pared either with meat gravy or made up maigre. 
Muscles also make an excellent vol-au-vent. 

STEWED FISH, HEBREW FASHION.— E.R. 
300. — Take 3 or 4 parsley-roots, cut them into long thin 
slices, and 2 or 3 onions also sliced, boil them together in a 
quart of water until quite tender ; then flavour it with gi'ouud 



Chap. XVI. FISH. 265 

white pepper, nutmeg, mace, and a little saffron, the juice 
of 2 lemons, and a spoonful of vinegar. Put in the fish, and 
let it stew for 20 or 30 minutes ; then take it out, strain the 
gravy, thicken it with a little flour and butter, have balls 
made of chopped fish, bread-crumbs, spices, and the yolk of 1 
or 2 eggs mixed up together, and drop them into the liquor. 
Let them boil, then put in the fish, and serve it up with tlie 
balls and parsley-roots. 

FISH CURRY 

301. — Is prepared in the same way as chicken or rabbit, 
with this difference only, that the stock should be invariably 
composed of fish broth. 

For pottiiig, collaring, and pickling, as well as for fish 
sauces, look to the several receipts under those heads. 

When flour is made use of in the preparation of fish-stew. 
or sauces, potato-Jlour is preferable to that made from wheat ; 
and in making them up, always use a wooden in preference to 
a silver spoon. 

TO PRESER VE FISH FRESH. 

302. — Boil together 3 quarts of water and a pint of vinegar, 
in which, when quite boiling, put the fish, and just scald it, 
but not for more tlian 2 minutes. Then hang up the fish in a 
cool place, and it will keep for 2 or 3 days, and dress as well 
as if fresh cauo^ht-. 

Several of the fish receipts here given make excellent side- 
dishes. It was formerly the English custom only to admit 
fish in the first course, but this is no longer the case, since it 
now appears at many fashionable tables as a side-dish in all 
stages of the dinner. 



CHAPTER XVir. 
GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 

303. — There is nothing that requires more attention on 
the part of the cook than the sauces which are wanted to all 
made dishes ; and those who are clever and economical will 
always contrive to procure the basis of these sauces in tlie 
manner pointed out in various parts of this volume. "Where a 



266 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVH. 

calf s head or a breast of veal is stewed, to make it the stock 
for gravy to serve a whole dinner for made dishes, it will onlj 
be necessary to give it the proper flavour with ham or beef-bone. 

GRAVY 

May be made of the skirts of beef, kidnej^, or milt, or of the 
liver of a fat ox, as well as of any other kind of meat, if cut in 
pieces, fried with onions, and seasoned with herbs and spices, 
as other graVies. A clever servant will contrive to supply, at 
a trifling expense, as nmch gravy as is wanted for the use of a 
small family by stewing down the trimmings of meat and 
bones. It may even be made of the shank-bones of legs and 
shoulders of mutton : they should be thrown into water, and, 
after a good soaking and brushing, be long boiled. The water 
in which they are done will add greatly to the richness of 
gravy, as does the jelly of cow-heels. The latter must lie all 
night in water, which causes the jelly to be of a good colour. 
When boiled 3 hours, and become cold, let the fat be carefully 
taken off*; and when apparently quite clear, lay some white 
paper upon it, rubbing it close with a spoon, v.liich will 
remove every particle of grease, and it will be as pure as the 
jelly of a calfs foot. 

Jn prejjaring meat to stew for gravy ^ beat it with a mallet 
or rolling-pin, and score it across in various places, as this will 
make it give out its juices ; season it with pepper and salt, 
and put it into a stewpan with butter only, heating it gradu- 
ally until it becomes brown, but shaking the pan frequently 
to see that it does not burn or stick to the bottom. It will 
generally be browned sufficiently in ^ an hour. If kept in a 
very cool place and covered closely in a stone jar, it will keep 
good for 2 or 3 days in summer, and more than a week in 
winter, but should not be thickened until it is meant to be used. 

Tarragon and knotted marjoram, by some called " London 
thyme," are a great improvement to gravies, as also all those 
condiments enumerated in the chapter on soups, but should 
be adde4 only a short time before serving. 

In the preparation of large dinners for company, it is indis- 
pensable to procure strong gravy to colour and impart flavour 
to sauces and ragouts, and this can be don.- by using coarse 
pieces of the lean of beef or veal, and the giblets or trimmings

skimmed, strained, thickened, and afterwards flavoured with 
whatever condiments are most suited to the dish it is to 

accompany. 

S TO CK FOR GRA VY. 

304. — A good mode of making stock for gravies is to cut leaa 
beef thin, put it into a gravy 
pot without any butter or fat, 
and set it on a fire covered, but 
take care it does not burn ; let 
it stay till all the gravy that 
comes out of the meat is dried 
up into it again, often shaking 
it ; put as much water as will 
cover the meat, and let that stew 
away. Then put to the meat 
a small quantity of water, herbs, 
onions, spice, and a bit of lean 
ham : simmer till it is rich, and 
keep it in a cool place. Do not Gravy Pot. 

take off the fat till going to be used. 

Or, an excellent stock may be made in this maimer : — Put 
into a stewpan 3 oz. of butter, 4 large carrots, 6 middling 
sized onions, 3 roots of parsley sliced, a small sprig of thyme, 
3 cloves, 3 bay-leaves, 2 lbs. of roach, bream, or dace, cu"- 
small, with salt, pepper, and ^ a bottle of white (but not 
sweet) wine, and nearly as much broth. Cover close, and 
simmer mitil the whole be mashed : strain it through a fine 
sieve. In another stewpan stew a pint of mushrooms, a little 
parsley and chibols, in ^ pint of water, till the flavour of all 
be obtained : strain both liquors, and heat them together. 

A GRAVY WITHOUT 3IEAT. 
305. — Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some 
pepper, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and a 
tablespoonful of walnut-pickle, into a basin ; slice an onion, 
flour, and fry it in a piece of butter till it is brown ; turn all 
ihe above into a small tosser with the onion ; cover it, and 
let it simmer 20 minutes ; strain it, and when cold take oflf 
the fat. 

GRA VY FOR A HA UNCH OF VENISON. 
806. — Cut off" the fat from 2 or 3 lbs. of a loin of old mut- 
ton, and set it in steaks on a gridiron for a few minutes, just to 

n2

brown one side ; put them into a saucepan with a quart of 
water, cover quite close for an hour, and simmer it gently ; 
then uncover it, and stew till the gravy is reduced to a pint ; 
season with salt only. 

GRA VY TO 3IAKE MUTTON EA T LIKE VENISON, 

307. — Pick a very stale woodcock or snipe, cut it in pieces 
(but first take out tlie bag from the entrails), and simmer with 
AH much unseasoned meat-gravy as yoLi will want. Strain it, 
and serve in the dish ; but if the mutton be not long kept, it 
will not acquire the venison flavour. 

VELOUTE. 

308. — Take 1 lb. of veal, with the remains of a fowl and a 
dozen of full-grown mushrooms, or a smaller number of green 
truffles ; heat these in melted butter, or beef fat, without 
browning ; season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, or mixed spices, 
to which may be added a couple of carrots and onions, with a 
tablespoonful or tM^o of flour. When boiled, skim off the fat, 
and let it simmer for bj hour, after which strain it, and keep 
it closely stopped for further use. 

Veal Gravy. — When all the meat has been taken from 
a knuckle of veal, divide the bones, and lay them in a stewpot, 
with a pound of the scrag of a neck, an ounce of lean bacon, 
a bunch of parsley, a little thyme, a bit of lemon-peel, and a 
dessertspoonful of pepper : add as much water as will cover 
them. Boil and skim it ; stop the pot down close, and let it 
simmer as slowly as possible 3 hours. Strain off", and let it 
stand till cold ; then skim it, and take the jelly from the sedi- 
ment. Pound some mace fine, and boil it with 2 spoonfuls of 
water, and add to the gravy. If cream is to be put to it, do 
not add the salt until the gravy comes off the fire. 

For White Meat. — Peel a lemon close to the juice, cut it 
into slices, and then into square bits ; blanch the liver of a 
fowl, and chop it small ; nxix the lemon and liver in a boat ; 
pour hot melted butter over the mixture, and stir it together, 
but do not let it boil, or it will become oily. 

Or: — Put the peel of a small lemon, cut very thin, into a 
oint of sv. cet rich cream, with a sprig of lemon-thyme and 
10 white peppercorns; simmer gently till it tastes well of the 
inmon, then strain it, and thicken it with 1 lb. of butter, and 



CiiAP. XVir. GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 269 

a dessertspoonful of flour rubbed in it ; boil it up, then pour 
the juice of the lemon strained into it, stirring it well. 

Essence of Ham, for improving the flavour of sauces, is 
made thus : — The meat being stripped from the bone, and put 
into a saucepan with the bone broken in small pieces, then 
stewed in a small quantity of water for several hours until the 
liquor becomes thick ; after ^^■hich it is strained, and again 
stewed with about the same quantity of very strong and well- 
spiced veal gra\y. 

A RICH GRAVY, 

309. — Cut beef into thin slices, according to the quantity 
wanted ; slice onions thin, and flour both ; fry them of a light 
pale brown, but do not on any account suffer them to get black ; 
put them into a stewpan, pour boiling water on the browning 
in the frying-pan, boil it up, and pour on the meat. Put to it 
a bunch of parsley, thyme, and savory, a small bit of knotted 
marjoram, the same of tarragon, some mace, berries of allspice, 
whole black peppers, a clove or two, and a bit of ham, or 
gammon of bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the 
juices of the meat, and be sure to skim the moment it boils, 
and often after. If for a hare, or stewed fish, anchovy should 
be added. 



SAUCES. 

MELTED BUTTER. 

310. — Although it may be presumed that every cook who 
understands her business knows how to melt butter, it is yet 
constantly brought to table either too thick or too thin, 
and not unfrequently filled with lumps of flour, or oiled, and 
requires more care in the management than is generally 
thought necessary. 

The excellence of melted butter greatly depends upon the 
pains taken to blend it with the flour before it is put upon the 
fire, the best plan of doing which is to rub them together with 
a knife on a wooden trencher. When well mixed, add 2 taljle- 
spoonfuls of hot water, or the same qua'iitity of milk ; put it 
into a small pipkin, shaking it one way until it boils, and not 
leaving it an instant ; it must boil a minute to take off the raw- 
ness, and if made oi fresh butter add a little salt. Remembcn- 
that if you set it on the hot coals, or over the fire, it will be 



270 MODEP.N DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap, XYII. 

oily ; if the butter and flour be not well mixed, it will be 
lumpy ; and if you put too much water, it will be thin and 
poor. By attending to these directions, and only using suffi- 
cient flour to. prevent the butter from oiling, it will be rich 
and smooth. 

Or: — Mix together by degrees 2 spoonfuls of floar in cold 
vrater ; make it smooth and thin ; then put on a pint of water, 
let it boil, stir in the flour and water to make it the required 
thickness, cut ^ lb. of fresh butter in small pieces, put it into 
the flour and vrater, let it boil well j it is then fit for use ; a 
pinch of salt may be required. 

When thin melted butter is required to pour over puddings, 
roast veal, &c.; make it the same way, adding a larger propor- 
tion of water or milk, the latter rendering it rather whiter than 
the water ; and if meant to be more rich than common, use 
cream instead of milk. Indeed, the French frequently enrich 
melted butter by adding the yolk of a raw e^^. 

Mcdtre d^ Hotel Butter. — Put i lb. of fresh butter upon a 
plate, the juice of 2 lemons, and 2 large tablespoonfuls of 
chopped parsley, -j a teaspoon ful of salt, and ^ that quantity 
of white pepper ; mix all well together, and keep in a cool 
place for use. 

To brown 3Ielted Butter. — Put a lump of butter into a 
fryingpan, and toss it round over the fire until it becomes 
brown ; then dredge some flxOur over it, which has been also 
browned by putting it either in the oven or before the fire, 
and stir it round with a spoon until the butter boils. 

By adding some of the flavoured vinegars and compound 
sauces to melted butter thus prepared, most of the fish-sauces 
can be made, and many of those in common use are composed 
in this simple manner. 

Parsley and Butter. — Scald a large handful of parsley in 
boiling water that has some salt in it ; when tender chop it 
fine, and stir it into some rather thick melted butter. There 
should be suflficient parsley to make the sauce green, and the 
parsley should not be put to the melted butter until about to 
be served, otherwise it will turn brown. 

Fennel Sauce. — Proceed as for parsley and butter. 
The first is used for the various purposes of fish, poultry, 
and fresh boiled meats ; fennel mostly for mackerel. 



CiiAP. XVII. GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CUllRY. 271 

Caper Sauce, ickite. — Put whole capers into melted butter, 
adding a little of the vinegar they are pickled in, a pinch of 
salt, and sufficient cream to make it white. This is used 
principally for boiled mutton. 

Caper Sauce, hrown. — Take some thick brown sauce, add- 
ing the vinegar the capers are pickled in ; season it highly 
with cayenne and salt. Put capers to the sauce just before 
serving ; and they must be used liberally. 

Nastui'tium buds or seeds are sometimes used as a substitute. 

EGG SAUCE. 
311. — Boil the eggs hard, cut them in small dice, and put 
the pieces into melted butter. The yolk may, however, be 
crushed to a powder, and used to thicken the butter. Or, if a 
more savouiy sauce is required, boil 2 eggs hard, mince them 
veiy fine, add a third portion of grated ham or tongue, a very 
little white pepper, and the juice of a lemon ; warm it up in 
melted butter. It is chiefly used for roast fowl and salt cod- 
fish ; and if the butter be sound, the salted will be found quite 
as good for all these purposes as the fresh. 

GARLIC SA UCE.—E. R. 

312. — Peel the garlic, divide it into cloves, boil it for 5 
minutes in water, then pour it off; add boiling water, and 
boil it 5 minutes longer ; repeat the process a third and fourth 
time, then strain the garlic, and send it to table in white 
sauce. The strength of the flavour may be either increased or 
diminished according- to the len^-th of time in boilin«-. In 
Languedoc, and many other parts of France, it is made by 
pounding the cloves in a mortar, and adding sweet oil imtil it 
is thus made into a paste of the appearance of cream, and is 
eaten with all sorts of meat, both roast and boiled. If not used 
as sauce, the cloves vrill be found very delicate if served as a 
vegetable. If properly done, they will taste like almonds. 

O^^ION SA UCE. 
313. — White. — Peel the onions, and put them on tlie fire in 
cold water ; when it boils, pour the water off, and fill up the 
saucepan from a kettle of boiling water to take out the strength 
of the onions. If this be done two or three times, they will 
become perfectly mild ; or if they be Spanish onions, boil 
d»em only once in milk ; then chop them, not too small, but so 



272 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Ohap. XYTL 

as to divide the pieces into flakes ; add to them butter that has 
been melted, rich, smooth, and thick. It is used to smother 
boiled rabbits, ducks, and tripe, or as sauce for a roast shoulder 
of mutton. Or beat the onions to a pulp, and pass them through 
a sieve to thicken the sauce, and make it appear like cream ; 
although this would appear more delicate, yet many people 
prefer the former mode. 

Brown. — Peel and slice some large onions, and put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter. Stir them over the fire 
until they are of a fine light brown; dust them with flour; 
then put in a pint of good beef-gravy, with a little cayenne 
pepper and salt ; when thus reduced by stewing to the proper 
thickness, rub them through the colander; and just before 
serving up, squeeze in the juice of ^ a lemon, or serve without 
rubbing through the colander. 

This is preferable for roast meats. 

Or : — Stew the onions in the stock-pot, or in some good 
gravy with a bit of sugar ; when very tender, chop them 
roughly ; thicken the gra^'y they were stewed in ; season witli 
pepper and salt. 

SHALOT SAUCE. 

314. — Put a few chopped shalots into a little gravy, boiled 
clear, and nearly half as much vinegar ; season with pepper 
and salt ; boil k an hour. 

SAUCE FOR RUMP-STEAK. 

315. — Take equal parts of ale, red wine, and ketchup, a 
piece of butter, and a little pepper, ^vith a teaspoonful of 
garlic-vinegar ; stir these over the fire in a small saucepan, 
and pour it very hot upon the steak. It will form a pleasant 
addition to the gravy of any roast meat, and can be made in a 
few minutes. 

SAUCE ROBERT. 

316. — Put a piece of butter the size of an eg^ into a 
saucepan ; set it over the fire, and wlien browning throw in a 
handful of onions cut in small dice ; fry them brown, but do 
not let them burn ; add h a spoonful of flour, sliake the onions 
in it, and give it another fry ; then put 4 spoonfuls of gravy, 
and some pepper and salt, and boil it gently 10 minutes; 
skim it. When ready to serve, add a teaspoonful of made 
mustard, a spoonful of vinegar, and the juice of ? a lemon, 
and pour it round the steaks or chops. They should be of a 



Chap. XVII. GRAT\, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 27^ 



fine yellow brown, and garnished with fried parsley and lemon. 
The sauce must not boil after the mustard is put in, otherwise 
it will curdle. 

SAUCES FOR ROAST BEEF OR MUTTON. 

317. — Grate horseradish on a bread-grater into a basin, then 
add 2 tablespoonfuls of cream with a little mustard and salt ; 
mix them well together ; then add 4 tablespoonfuls of the best 
vinegar, and mix the whole thoroughly. The vinegar and 
cream are both to be cold ; add a little powdered white sugar. 
This is a very fine sauce ; it may be served in a small tureen. 

O?' : — Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or 
grate it, M'hich is better ; warm it in melted butter, adding a 
spoonful of musln'oom ketchup, and one of walnut, or the 
vinegar from walnut pickle. 

Or : — Scrape very fine or grate the horseradish ; add a little 
made mustard, and 2 spoonfuls of pounded white sugar to 4 of 
vinegar : mix the whole well together, and place it under the 
meat, when nearly done, to catch the gravy vrhich drops from 
it while roasting. This sauce should be very thick. 

Queen Mary^s Sauce. — Take a shoulder of mutton that has 
hung till it is tender. When three parts roasted, put a soup- 
plate under it, with 3 spoonfuls of hot water, the same of port 
wine, a shalot, an anchovy chopped fine, and a little pepper ; 
baste the meat with this and the gravy tliat drops from it. 
When the mutton is taken up, turn the inside upwards, score it 
various ways, pour the gravy over, and cover it with a quantity 
of fried crumbs of bread. 

Mandram is a sauce commonly used in the West Indies with 
roast beef and mutton. It is made with a sliced cucumber, a 
chopped shalot, and a minced green capsicum, mixed up in a 
couple of tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine and vinegar ; and as 
capsicums can be had green during great part of the autumn, 
it can be also made in England, but neither chilis nor capsi- 
cums, if dried, will impart the same flavour. 

MINT SAUCE FOR ROAST LAMB. 

318. — Pick the leaves off the stalks; wash and dry them 
carefully ; chop them with a sharp knife very quickly, to pre- 
serve their green colour ; put it into a boat ; add sufficient 
vinegar to make it liquid, and powdered sugar to take off the 
acidity of the vinegar.

Df butter, some pepper and salt, and squeeze over them the 
iuice of ^ a lemon ; set them over the fire ; when they have 
criven out their liquor, thicken it ^ith flour and butter, and add 
?ufF.cient cream to whiten the sauce. This is a very excellent 
.auce for fowls, rabbits, and all sorts of white fricassees. 

Or -—Wash and pick a pint of young mushrooms, and rub 
them with salt, to take off the tender skin; put them mto a 
saucepan ^ith a little salt, some nutmeg, a blade of mace, 
a pint of cream, and a good piece of butter rubbed m flour 
Boil them up. and stir them till done ; then pour it round 
the chickens, &c. Garnish with lemon. If you cannot get 
fresh mushrooms, use pickled ones,- done white, with a little 
mushroom-powder vnih. the cream. 

Broiv7i.—1t may also be made brown by either putting the 
huttons into a pipkin, and frying them with a little butter until 
they become of a delicate brown, and then ste%nng them m 
stroncr crraw of either beef or veal; or by making it ot old 
mushrooms chopped small, fried and stewed in the same 
manner, and then seasoned according to taste, it is inucn 
used for cutlets and many sorts of ragouts. 
CELERY SAUCE. 

320.— Strip the outer parts of the stem, and, after carefully 
washing the remaining portion, cut it into small pieces ; put 
to it a blade of mace, without any other spice, and stew it in 
^ood veal broth until very tender; it will take a good deal ot 
time, more particularly the thick hard end of the root. After 
this thicken it with melted butter, and flavour it with a small 
quantity of white wine ; or it may be thickened with boiled 
cream without wine. It is usually served with boiled turkey, 
bat is very delicate with any kind of white poultry or veal. 

O/-.— Take the white part of 3 heads of celery, cut them 
m pieces 2 inches long ; boil them in a very little good whi e 
broth ; slice an onion thin ; put it in a stewpan with a little 
parsley and th^-me, and a scrap of lean ham, or the ham may 
be omitted. Sweat the whole in a little butter until the onions 
ure done, then stir in sufficient flour to thicken the sauce ; stir 
it over the fire %vell, then mix in gradually the liquor the 
ceiery was boiled in, and as much new milk boiling as maj

be required for the dish. Let it boil 20 minutes ; strain 
through a fine sieve ; put in the celery ; add salt and a little 
liae white sugar ; serve boiling- hot, and rather thick. 

TR UFFLE SA UCE. 

321. — Take a pound of truffles ; brush and wash them care- 
fully ; put them in a stewpan with some good gravy, two wine- 
glasses of wliite wine, a small onion, a faggot of parsley and 
thyme, and an ounce of bacon fat. Let them stew gently 
U!itil quite tender ; take them out, strain and skim the gravy, 
thicken it with roux or a lump of flour and butter ; peel the 
truffles, cut them in slices as thick as a penny-piece, Marm 
them in the sauce, and serve. 

CHES TNUT SA UCE. 

322. — Scald a score of chestnuts in hot M^ater for 10 minutes , 
skin them ; let them stew gently for about t an hour in some 
good gravy seasoned with a glass of white wine, a little white 
pepper, salt, and mace or nutmeg ; and when quite soft, serve 
them in the dish. 

Or : — Pulp them through a colander to thicken the gravy, 
making it either broivn or ivhite, by using in the former beef- 
gravy, and in the latter veal-broth, with pounded almonds, and 
without pepper. 

Either of these is equally fit for sauce to guinea-fowl or 
turkey, as well as for stuffing the body of the bird. 

SAUCES FOR ROILED WHITE POULTRY.— E. R. 

323. — Liver sauce. — Take the livers of as many fowls as 
may be required for the intended quantity of sauce, or, that of 
a rabbit being much larger, take 1 liver, boil it with some 
jprigs of thyme and parsley ; dissolve in the water, after taking' 
it out, 2 anchovies boned ; boil 2 eggs hard, leave out 1 white, 
ind shred the rest with the liver, heibs, and anchovies; pound 
them together in a mortar, adding a saltspoonful of grated 
lemon-peel and a little pepper and salt. Put it into the sauce- 
pan, squeeze upon it the juice of ^ a lemon, thicken the liquor 
with butter and a little flour, add to it the pounded ingredients, 
and stir it until finished. 

Or : — If gravy be used instead of water, and butter be 
omitted, the above may be properly employed as an excellent 
sauce for roasted rabbit, or for full-grown poultry. 



276 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYH. 

White Sauce. — Boil a large blade of mace, a few cloves and 
peppercorns, in -^ a pint of soft \vater, until the flavour be ob- 
tained ; sti-ain it off, put it into a saucepan with 4 anchovies 
chopped fine, i lb. of butter rolled in flour, and i a pint of 
cream ; boil, and stir it well, 2 minutes. Put some in a tureen, 
and the remainder in the dish. 

I^or Chickens.— Take the legs and necks, with a small bit 
of the scrag of veal or mutton ; put them into a saucepan with 
2 ])lades of mace, a few white peppercorns, an anchovy, a head 
of celery sliced, a bunch of svreet herbs, and a small bit of 
lemon-peel ; boil these in a quart of water to ^ a pint ; strain, 
and thicken it with i lb. of butter and some flour ; boil it 5 
minutes, then put in 2 spoonfuls of mushrooms, and, having 
beaten up the yolks of 2 eggs with a teacupful of cream, put it 
into the sauce, and keep shaking it one way over the fire till it 
is nearly boiling ; then put it into a sauce-tm'een. 

Vegetable ?rlarroio Sauce. — Few sauces are more delieate 
as an accompaniment for young chickens, whether roast or 
boiled, than vegetable marrow when deprived of its seeds, if 
stewed to a pulp and passed through a fine sieve, so as to form 
it into a puree, which may be then thinned either with fowl- 
broth seasoned with mace, or with cream and nutmeg. 

SAUCES FOR ROAST FOWLS. 

324. — Stew any moderate quantity of ham, veal, and mush- 
rooms, with svreet herbs, a shalot, a little allspice, and a piece 
of butter, until all become brown ; then let the whole simmer 
gently for a long time in either weak broth or water, until they

garlic, a laurel-leaf, and sliced onions ; add a little good gravy, 
a sprig of knotted m.arjoram, and a spoonful of tarragon vine- 
gar ; simmer it slowly an hour, strain it off either into the dish 
or a boat. 

Or : — Boil some veal-grav}'-, pepper, salt, the juice of a 
Seville orange and a lemon, and i as much of port wine as of 
gravy ; and pour it into the dish or a boat. 

Or : — If wanted in a hurry, cut a few slices of calf's liver, 
or any kind of brown meat; fry them with a little lean bacon

and an onion, raid, ^vllen browned, pour upon them boiling 
water to what strength you please, and strain it. 

WHITE SA UCE. 

325. — Make a very good white broth of a knuckle of veal 
and a little ham ; seasoned with 2 or 3 cloves, a blade of mace, 
2 bay-leaves, a faggot of parsley and thyme, onion, carrot, 
and turnip. AYh.en tlie broth is very good, melt a little butter, 
add flour to it according to the Cjuantity of sauce required ; 
when the flour is cooked, Ltir in the broth, strained, and mix it 
thoroughly ; let it boil ^ an hour ; strain it off*, and then it 
is fit for use. When required, put it on the fire, add cream 
sufficient to make it white and rich, and let it boil very fast, 
stirring it continually until it becomes a thick white rich sauce. 
Or : — The water that has boiled fowls, veal, or rabbit, or a 
little broth that may be in the house, or the feet and necks of 
chickens, or raw or dressed veal, will suffice. Stew any of 
these with a little water, a bit of lemon-peel, some sliced onion, 
a few white peppercorns, a little pounded mace or nutmeg, and 
a bunch of sweet herbs, until the flavour be good ; then strain 
it, add a little good cream, a piece of butter, and a Hide 
flour : salt to your taste. A squeeze of lemon may be added 
after the sauce is taken off" the fire, shaking it v/ell. Yolk of 
cg^ is. often used in fricassee; but if you have any cream it is 
better, as the former is apt to curdle. 

O7' : — Boil a stick of celery and a bunch of parsley in a pint 
of milk, adding white pepper and a little salt ; then put 2 oz. 
of butter into a saucepan, let it melt, add to it an onion sliced 
thin, dredge in flour until it is a paste, but do not allovr it to 
become brov»ai. Strain the milk, and add it by degrees to the 
]3utter and flour, stirring it very well ; then boil tlie whole 
together^ stirring all the time, and boiling it until it is quite 
thick and smooth ; pass it tlirough a fine sieve or tammy. If 
wanted to be ^ery rich, let it cool a little, and then add an egg 
previously beaten, and mix very gradually ; warm it over the 
fire, stirring it well, but do not let it boil, or it will curdle. 

Or : — Mix a teaspoonful of flour with t lb. of butter, a 
little salt, and ground white pepper ; let them be well blended 
together with a wooden spoon, then add a spoonful of vinegar, 
and 1 or 2 of water ; mix the whole together, stirring it one 
way over the fire. 



278 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVn. 

CULL IS. 

326. — Lay over the bottom of a stewpan as much lean veal 
as will cover it an inch thick : cover the veal with thin slices of 
undressed gammon, 2 or 3 onions, 2 or 3 bay-leaves, some sweet 
herbs, 2 blades of mace, and a few cloves. Cover tlie stewpan, 
and set it over a slow fire ; but when the juices come out, ]et 
the fire be a little quicker. When the meat is of a fine brown, 
fill the pan with good beef broth, boil and skim it, then simmer 
an hour ; add a little water, mixed with as much flour as \\\\\ 
make it properly thick ; boil it ^ an hour, and strain it. This 
will keep a week. 

ROUX. 

327. — White. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan over a 
slow fire, allow it to melt, then drain off* the buttermilk : make 
it into a paste by dredging fiour over it, and keep it on the fire 
for i of an hour, taking care that it does not lose its colour. 

Broivn is made in the same manner, only allowed to fry of a 
dark colour. French cooks use no other kind of browning. 

LIAISON. 

328. — To thicken or enrich White or Fish Soups, use the 
following : — Pour the soup, boiling hot, on the beaten yolks of 
2 or 3 fresh eggs, from which the small tougli substance found 
in it, and called " the tread," should be removed ; the soup 
should not be suffered to boil after the eggs are added, as it is 
then apt to curdle. 

Or : — Break the yolk of an eg'g with 3 spoonfuls of cream, 
beat them up in the tureen, and pour the boiling soup upon it. 
This may be made in the same proportion, and kept in a basin 
for other dishes. 

SAUCE FOR FRICANDEAU, OR ROAST VEAL. 
329. — Boil an unwashed anchovy cut small, v/ith a cup of 
gravy, a glass of port wine, a shalot minced, and the juice of 
i a small lemon ; strain, and mix in the dish with the gra^'y of 
the meat. Or use sorrel sauce.

hut do not let it boil. This sauce should be made at the time 
of serving. 

SA UCES FOR GEESE. 

331. — 1^01' a Green Goose. — Take -^ pint of sorrel -juice, 2 
t^lasses of white v.ine, a nutmeg quartered, a cupful of fried 
crumbs, and 2 lumps of sugar ; let all boil together, then beat 
it smooth, adding a piece of fresh butter, and serve it very hot 
in a tureen, or in the dish with the goose. It should not be 
made too thick with the bread-crumbs; and if mucli acid 
sliould not be approved, the wine must be equal in quantity to 
the sorrel juice. 

Gooseherry Sauce. — Wash some sorrel, put it into a clotli 
and press out the juice ; melt a piece of butter with flour, 
using this juice instead of water ; let it be very tinck. Scald 
green gooseberries until very tender, and add them to the 
sauce. This is a fine acid sauce if not spoiled with sugar. If 
not sweetened, add a little cayenne pepper. 

For a Stubble Goose. — Mix a teaspoonful of made mustard, 
■^ a teaspoonful of salt, with a very little cayenne pepper, in 
a large vrineglassful of port wine, a tablespoonful of mush- 
room ketchup, i -pint of gravy, 2 teaspoonfuls of lemon-juice, 
and a bit of butter rolled in flour ; stir and mix all thoroughly 
over the fire, and serve very hot in a sauceboat. 

Apple Sauce. — Pare, core, and slice some apples ; and put 
them in a stone jar, into a saucepan of water, or on a hot 
hearth. If on a liearth, let a spoonful or two of water be put 
in to keep them from burning. TVhen tliey are done, bruise 
them to a mash, and put to them a piece of butter the size of 
a nutmeg, and a little brown sugar if required ; but it destroys 
the slight acid flavour of the apples, and its corrective to goose 
and pork. 

Savour?/ Apple Sauce. — Pulp the apples, and, if wanted of 
a good colour, add to them a little juice of beet-root or cochi- 
neal : season with cayenne pepper, and a glass of vinegar or 
lemon-pickle, taking care not to make it too acid. This will 
prove a substitute for tomata or sorrel sauce, when neitlier 
, can be obtained ; if for the latter, a little spinach-juice will 
give it a colour. 

SAUCE FOR DUCKLINGS. 
S32. — Take young green onions or chives; chop tliem very 



280 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XYII. 

small, then put them into some thick melted butter, with 
pepper, salt, and a spoonful of lemon-pickle ; stir it well 
together, and, when very hot, put it into the dish with the 
ducks upon it. Should the flavour of the onions be thought 
too strong, they may be scalded previously. 

Or : — Mix i pint of sorrel-juice, a glass of white wine, 
some scalded gooseberries, some white sugar, and a bit of 
butter. Boil them up and serve in a boat. 

SAUCE FOR SUCKING-PIG. 

383. — Take the inside of a French roll and boil it to a pulp, 
along with an onion and a little salt ; chop the brains and put 
them into a teacupful of the gravy that runs from the pig ; 
then take as much butter as will be sufficient for the sauce, 
and put into it a good squeeze of lemon, with ^ a glass of 
white wine. 

Some cooks make a stuffing for the pig in nea-rly the same 
manner, only making it with less butter and more bread, 
besides sometimes seasoning it with sage. 

Currant Sauce. — Clean an ounce of currants, and boil them 
in \ pint of water for a few minutes, pour the v>'hole over a 
teacupful of bread-crumbs ; let it soak, and then add a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, 4 or 6 cloves, and a glass of port 
wine ; beat it a little, and stir it over the fire until it is quite 
smooth. 

SA UCES FOR WILD-FO WL. 

334. — A teaspoonful of made mustard, the same of essence 
of anchovies and red pepper ; a tablespoonful of ketchup, and 
a glass of claret. 

Or : — Simmer a teacupful of port wine, the same quantity 
of good meat gravy, a little shalot, a little pepper, salt, a 
grate of nutmeg, and a bit of mace, for 10 minutes: put in a 
bit of butter and flour, give it all one boil, and pour it through 
the birds. In general they are not stuffed, but may be done 
so if liked. 

Or : — Mince some shalots very fine, put them into a small 
saucepan with some peppercorns, 2 tablespoonfuls of strong 
clear gravy, and the same quantity of vinegar ; when suffi- 1 
eiently boiled add a little salt, and strain it through a sieve. 
It may be served either hot or cold. 

Shikaree Sauce. — Mix together a dessertspoonful of pounded 



Chap. XYII. GEAYY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 28i 

white sugar, with the same quantity of cayenne pepper, or, if 
the parties be averse to so much pepper, a tea or saltspoonful ; 
add to it a g-lass of claret or port wine, a glass of ketchup, or 
a dessertspoonful of essence of anchovies, and the juice of ^ a 
large lemon. Warm it over the fire, and either serve it up in 
a butter-boat, or, having scored the breast of the duck, and 
laid a slice of butter upon it, pour the sauce over. 

Col. Hairker^s Sauce. — Port wine or claret 1 glass, sauce 
a la Russe * 1 tablespoonful, ketchup 1 tablespoonful, lemon- 
juice 1 tablespoonful, lemon-peei' 1 slice, shalot (large) 1 sliced, 
cayenne (the darkest) 4 grains, mace 1 or 2 blades : to be 
scalded, strained, and added to the gravy which comes from 
the fowl in roasting. The addition of a small spoonful of 
sugar would render this equal to shikaree. 

LIVER SAUCE FOR HARE OR ROAST RABBIT. 

335. — Stew the liver in some good grav}'' — of beef for hare, 
and of veal for rabbit — when quite tender chop it fine, with 
a clove of shalot and some fine jDotherbs, along with a tea- 
spoonful of chili- vinegar, a wineglass of port wine, and ^ a 
teacupful of currant-jelly, if for hare, or white wine only for 
rabbit. 

Or : — Pound the whole of the solid ingredients, and mix 
them in the gravy to thicken it, adding afterwards the vinegar 
and wine. 

Or : — Take the crumb of a penny roll and steep it in port 
wine, put it on the fire with a piece of butter ; beat it smooth, 
add pepper, salt, and jelly, with ^ a glass of vinegar ; let it 
boil, and serve it up very hot. 

SA UCE FOR WINGED GA3IE. 

336. — Put a glass of white wine, t a lemon sliced, or a 
dessertspoonful of the juice, with a few strips of the peel of a 
Seville orange, and a spoonful of salad oil, to a teacupful of 
the gravy which runs from the birds, seasoned with a clove of 
garlic, salt, and a few peppercorns. Boil it for f of an hour, 
skim it, strain it through a sieve, and serve it. 

If for grouse or black-cock, port should be substituted for 
white wine.

BREAD SAUCE. 

337. — Boil an onion, ^vith some whole black pepper, in 
milk, till the onion is quite a pap. Pour the milk strained on 
grated white stale bread, and cover it. In an hour put it into 
a saucepan, with a good piece of fresh butter ; boil the whole 
up together, and serve ; add a little salt. 

Or : — Take a large onion, slice it dovrn very thin, put it 
into some broth or water, let it boil until tender; add a 
sufficient quantity of bread-crumbs to thicken it, 2 ounces of 
butter, pepper, and salt, and a little good cream ; boil it mitil 
it is thick and veiy smooth, but do not allow it to be too thick 
to pour into the sauce-tureen. 

Or : — Grate a teaspoonful of fresh onion and put it to the 
bread-crumbs before the boiling milk is poured over it. Season 
it, and add a few grains of cayenne pepper. 

SAUCE FOR COLD FOWL OR PARTRIDGE. 

338. — Rub down in a mortar the yolks of 2 eggs boiled 
hard, an anchovy, 2 dessertspoonfuls of oil, 3 of vinegar, a 
shalot, cayemie if approved, and a teaspoonful of mustard. All 
should be pounded before the oil is added. Then strain it. 
Shalot-vinegar, instead of shalot, eats well ; but then omit 
1 spoonful of the common vinegar. Salt to your taste. 

A most excellent accompaniment to cold roast fowls, or 
white game of any sort, is to bring it up covered with either 
common or clouted cream ; this is very customary throughout 
Devon and Cornwall. 

SAUCE A LA TART ARE. 

339. — Take the yolk of an e^^^ drop into it very slowly a 
tablespoonful of salad-oil, beating it up by degrees until per- 
fectly mixed ; add a tablespoonful of vinegar, a little chopped 
parsley, a tablespoonful of French mustard, pepper, and salt ; 
beat up the whole together : make and keep the sauce in a 
cold place ; put it into a dish, and lay the boiled fowl upon it. 
This sauce should be beaten till it resembles cream. 

POIVRADE SAUCE. 

340. — Chop 2 shalots, and bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled 

e^^ with a little salt and cayenne pepper ; beat all up in a 

spoonful of mushroom or v.alnut ketchup, season with chili 

vinegar or the juice of lemon : to be made into proper con- 



CnAP. XYII GEAYT, SAUCES, AND CUEEY. 28S 

sistency with melted butter if to be eaten hot, or with salad- 
oil if cold. This is very relishiiig- with either hot or cold 
game, and can be made in a few minutes. 

ACHA.—E. R. 
341. — T a, large Spanish onion. 4 capsicums, as much salt 
and lemon-juice as may be agreeable to the palate, all pounded 
together in a mortar. 

Fish Acha. — Boil a piece of salt fish, cut an onion and some 
capsicums in pieces, pound them well together, add a little 
vinegar, and make them into a puree. 

Indian -picJile Sauce. — Take some gravy, thicken with flour 
and butter ; cut in small dice some Indian pickle, add a little 
of ihQ vinegar, let it boil up, throw in t!ie dice, and serve hot. 
This is for salmon cutlets ; it is also good for broiled mackend 
or for grilled chicken. 

SAUCES PIQUANTES.—E. R. 

342. — Put into a stewpan the muscles of a knuckle of veal, 
some slices of ham or bacon, a cupful of grav^'^, a spoonful or 
two of strong vinegar, a bay-leaf, a clove of garlic, a little 
thjTue, 1 clove, and a little salt ; skim it, and, when it has 
stewed i of an hour, pass it through a sieve: then add sorrel, 
parsley, and mushrooms, all chopped fine, and whole capers ; 
heat it again, and serve it in the dish. 

Or: — Put 1 or 2 oz. of butter, with 2 shred onions, a 
carrot, a parsnip, a little thyme, laurel, basil, 2 cloves, 2 
shalots, a clove of garlic, and some parsley, into a stewpan ; 
turn 4:he whole over the fire till it becomes brown, then shake 
in some flour, and moisten it with some broth and a spoonful 
of vinegar. Let it boil over a slov,-- fire ; sldni and strain it x 
then add pepper and salt ; and serve with any dish of which 
vou would Avish to have the flavour heiGfhtened. 

A V Espagnole. — Besides a fev/ slices of ham and veal, put 
into a ste'ff^an any remains which you may have of poultry 
and game, and let them boil for 1 hour in water more than 
sufficient to cover them ; after which skim off the fat from the 
gravy, add fried onions, sweet herbs, a bay-leaf, spice, mace, 
and mushrooms, with minced carrots, celery, shalots, and a 
small clove of garlic, and leave the whole to stew until quite 
mashed : it will take full 2 hours. Then strain it, and if the 



284 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XVII. 

gravy be not strong enough add sufficient coulis or glaze to 
make it so. If it wants flavour, add soy, and, if mushrooms 
had not been one of the ingredients, put in ketchup : if not 
thick enough, a little arrowroot, or common flour, "with a piece 
of butter, will have the effect ; but if the gravy be rich, it will 
not require the addition. 

Such is the foundation of the sauce ; but in most case*" 
white wine is added, for the purpose of stewing game : it is 
needless to say that Madeira and sherry are best, but Cape or 
ginger wine will be found good substitutes. 

A la Provengale. — Put into a casserole 2 spoonfuls of 
salad-oil, a shalot, a clove of garlic, and some mushrooms, all 
minced, and placed upon the fire in any sort of good strong 
oroth, seasoned with pepper and salt, together with pot-herbs ; 
leave it there for ^ an hour ; then skim it so far as to remove 
much of the appearance of the oil ; strain it, and add some 
white wine to suit the taste. 

Or, as Sauce Maiyre : — ^Fry a large quantity of onions and 
put them along with the above into the casserole, with white 
wine, until well browned ; then strain it ; add a tablespoonful 
of salad-oil with a little flour, and mix it gently, but con- 
tinually, for a few minutes, until completely mingled. 

A V Hollandaise — for meat, fowl, or fish. Put 6 spoonfuls 
of ^^•ater and 2 of tarragon vinegar, with 1 oz. of butter, into 
a stewpan ; warm and thicken it with the yolks of 2 eggs. 
Make it quite hot, but do not boil it ; stir it all the time ; 
squeeze in the juice of ^ a lemon, and strain it through a sieve. 
Season with salt and cayenne. It should be quite thick. 

TOMATA SAUCE. 

343. — Take ^ a dozen ripe tomatas ; slice them ; squeeze 
out the seeds and water, and put them, with salt, cayenne 
pepper, pounded mace, and allspice, into a stewpan, without 
any water, and let them simmer slowly in their own liquor till 
quite dissolved ; when completely done, pass them through a 
fine hair sieve, beat them up with a bit of butter, and serve. 

A V Italienne. — Slice a couple of Spanish onions and \ a 
dozen of tomatas into a stewpan, which, with a sprig of thyme, 
2 bay-leaves, 6 pods of pxmento, 2 teaspoonfuls of curry- 
powder, salt, and a cup of rich gravy, simmer very gently 



Chap, XVn. GPAYY, SAUCES, AND CURRY. 285 

until the whole will pulp through a colander ; stir well, that 
the sauce may not burn. 

A la Francaise. — Take 6 or 8 tomatas, cut them in 2 and 
across ; squeeze out the liquor, and put them into a stewpan ; 
add a sliced onion, a very small bit of garlic, a bay-leaf, a 
bunch of parsley, and a spoonful or two of vinegar. Boil the 
whole together, rub through a tamis sieve, thicken with flour 
and butter, and add a little glaze. 

Or : — Squeeze out the water, simmer the fruit with a little 
butter, salt, and pepper, until it will pulp as above. If too 
thin, reduce it by boiling. A minute or two before serving, 
add a little veloute and a bit of butter, and give it one boil ; 
or, even independently of the veloute, it will make an agree- 
able sauce for roast lamb. 

SAUCE AUX EPINAEDS. 

344. — Pick off the stalks of tlie spinach ; wash and drain it ; 
then, without water, stew till it will beat to a mash. Put in a 
good piece of butter and some milk; sinmier, and stir over a 
slow fire till the sauce be of the consistence of thick melted 
butter. Add a little pepper and salt while dressing. This is 
a very good sauce for boiled fowls or veal. 

PUREE BE C ON C OMBRES. 

345. — Slice thin some middling-sized cucumbers, drain the 
liquor from them, and put them, with 4 onions, into a stewpan, 
with a piece of butter ; when sufficiently stewed to pulp 
through a colander, add a large teacupful of cream, a little 
flour and pepper. Boil 20 minutes, and, when going to serve, 
put in salt. 

SAUCE A LA STE. MENEHOULB.—E. R. 
346. — Put some butter into a stewpan, shake over it a little 
Hour ; add a cupful of cream, parsley, young onions, \ a bay- 
leaf, and a shalot. Put it on the fire, keeping it stirred. 
Then pass it through a sieve : put it on tlie fire again with 
some chopped parsley, a little pepper, and minced mushrooms 
Serve it over boiled fowls. 

LA MAYONNAISE. 
347. — Perhaps the most esteemed mode of making sauce 
for any sort of cold meats or fish is that known in France oy 
this title. 



286 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYH. 

Put into a rouiid-bottomed basin the yolk of an egg and a 
pinch of salt; stir in very quickly, drop by drop, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of salad-oil, working the spoon yerx rapidly round, 
to work in the oil ; when it is thick add a few drops of tar- 
ragon "sdnegar, then more oil, until there is sufficient sauce ; 
thm it with a little more vinegar. It should be quite thick, 

and rather acid. 

CARACHI.—E. R. 

348. — Take 1 head of garlic and cut each clove into 2 pieces, 
2 teaspoonfuls of cayemie pepper, 3 tablespoonfuls of soy, 3 
of mushroom ketchup, 3 of walnut pickle, 6 anchovies dis- 
solved, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of mangoe or Indian pickle liquor, 
and a pint of the best vinegar, vnth sufficient cochineal to 
colour. 

Both the above are thus sauces maigres, but, when not in- 
tended for fast -days, may be much improved by being made 
into &. puree with an admixture of melted calfs-foot jelly. 

SAUCE BO YALE. 

349. — Cut a slice of white bread, and stew it in white broth 
until it is quite thick ; then take it off the fii'e ; pound in a 
mortar the yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, and i a dozen almonds 
reduced to paste, with the breast of a cold roast fowl ; mix 
this with the eggs and bread, and pound them all together 
with a little pepper and salt ; add a sufficient quantity of 
cream to make it of a proper consistency, and simmer the whole 
over the fire, stirring it all the time without letting it boil. 

Sauce a la Heine is nearly the same. — Bruise the breast 
of a chicken to a paste, and moisten it with a consomme of 
veal or fowl brotli ; let it stew gently over a slow fire, and 
then pass it through the tamis and mix vrixh. it some bechamel 
sauce. Then have ready the yolks of 2 eggs beaten up with a 
large spoonful of thick cream, and stir the mixture into the 
sauce a minute or two before serving it up. 

Both the above are served at the most fashionable tables, 
and may be used with turkey-poults and guhiea-biids. 

THE ORIGINAL DUDE SAUCE. 

350, — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan ; when melted add 

6 onions slired ; as soon as they begin to take colour, put in 

1-^ dozen of ciiilis chopped fine ; stir it well together for 4 

minutes, then put in a small quantity of dried salt fish, not 



Chap. XYII. GRAVY, SAUCES, AKD CUREY. 287 

exceeding 2 square inclies, chopped very fine ; keep stirring-, 
and, as the butter dries, add a large cupful of the pulp of 
fresh tomatas, a teaspoonful of salt, the juice of a lemon, and 
a little water ; mix the whole very well together, and let it be 
of the consistence of a paste, though not .00 dry. It is eaten 
with cold meat, but will not keep. 

QUIHI SAUCE AND CHETNEY. 

351. — Take 8 oz. of sharp apples pared and cored, 8 oz. of 
tomatas, 8 oz. of salt, 8 oz. of brown sugar, 8 oz. of raisins, 
4 oz. of red chilis, 4 oz. of ginger pov.-dered, 2 oz. of garlic- 
and 2 oz. of shalots. Pound all these ingredients separately 
in a mortar, using cayenne pepper if chilis are not to be had. 
Mix the whole together, and add 3 quarts of vinegar and 1 
quart of lemon-juice. Place the jar containing this composition 
on a stove, or by the side of a fire in a heat not less than 130° 
Fahrenheit, and stir it twice a-day for a month ; then strain, 
but do not squeeze it dry. Bottle the liquor, which is an 
excellent sauce for any kind of fish or meat, hot or cold. A 
teaspoonful will impart a fine flavour to any ragout, or be 
sufficient for a pint of broth. The residue, which is the chet- 
ney, should be put into pots or jars. It may also be used in 
sauces and gravies, or eaten like mustard, \\ith cold meat, or 
spread upon grills, being an excellent ingredient for devils, 
wet or dry. This admirable sauce is the invention of Colonel 
Tapp, and in India goes by his name. It may be made very 
good with vinegar only, omitting the lemon-juice. 

KHICHAREE SA UCE. 

352. — Boil a pint of rice in broth, and, having steeped a 
teacupful of di"ied peas in water, boil them till they are soft. 
Then slice 2 or 3 onions, and fry them in butter, with a dozen 
or two of cardamom-seeds, a little white pepper, 6 cloves, and 
salt ; take out the onions when bro\\Tied, and the spice, and 
add a cup of curds or milk to the butter ; stew it a little ; mix 
the onions, spice, and peas thoroughly with the rice, and pour 
the butter, &c., over it. Or put the whole into an earthen jar ; 
cover it with a paste, and put into an oven, or over a charcoal 
fire, for 26 minutes, adding sufficient broth to moisten it, in 
which case the rice must only be half boiled previously. 

CHRISTOPHER NORTH'S SAUCE.

WINE PUDDING SAUCE. 

354. — Sweeten i pint of melted butter, add a little grated 

lemon - peel or nutmeg, and a 
couple of glasses of white wine ; 
make it quite hot, but not to 
boil, and serve immediately.

of ^ a lemon 
boil up ; take it off the fire and 
pour it on two yolks of eggs 
beaten. Stir quickly, and pour 
round tlie pudding. 



GEE3IAN PUDDING SAUCE. 

355. — Sweeten -J pint of white wine, make it almost boil, 
and pour it hot to the yolks of 6 well-beaten eggs ; whisk it 
well, or mill it in a machine like a chocolate-mill. This is a 
very delicious sauce over a plum or any other boiled pudding ; 
if a plain batter pudding, a little lemon-juice is an improve- 
ment. 

SA UCES FOR FISH. 

356. — The stock for fish sauces should be made of the water 
in which fish has been boiled, adding the bones, fins, &c., all 
well stewed down ; when fish is filleted, the bones should 
always be employed in this way : stew tliem with an onion 
and a little white pepper, strain the broth, which will be very 
rich, thicken it witli cream, butter, and flour, or roux ; and 
add whatever the sauce is to be made of. The following may 
be generally used, according to fancy, for nearly every species 
of fish. 

Horseradish Sauce. — Stew an onion m a little fish-stock 
until it will pulp ; add a teaspoonful of grated horseradish, 
and 1 or 2 spoG7ifuls of essence of anchovies. Beat all together 



Chap. XVJI. GRAVY, SAUCES, AND CUREY. 289 

over a fire, thicken it with a little butter, and finisli with a 
spoonful of lemon-pickle or lemon-juice. Vinegar may be 
substituted, in which case it must be mixed with the horse- 
mdish, and boiled with it ; while the lemon or lemon-pickle, 
being of a more delicate flavour, should only be warmed. 

Or : — Scrape the horseradish thin and chop it small, or 
grate it, which is better ; warm it in melted butter, adding a 
spoonful of mushroom ketchup and one of walnut, or the 
vinegar from walnut-pickle. 

For freshwater Fish. — Take 2 large anchovies, ^ an onion 
finely chopped, 1 spoonful of vinegar, and 4 of sherry or 
ginger wine : boil it together, thicken it with flour, and add 4 
spoonfuls of cream or melted butter, in which latter case the 
flour may be omitted. 

For all sorts of Fish. — Take a spoonful of vinegar, 1 of 
Indian soy, the same of mushroom ketchup and Harvey's sauce, 
with a little cayenne. Add 3 large spoonfuls of melted 
butter ; stir all well, and heat it over the fire. 

Or : — Put equal quantities of water and vinegar into a 
saucepan, and thicken it with the yolk of an eg^ to every 4 
spoonfuls of the water and vinegar. Make it quite hot, but 
do not boil it ; stir it or shake the pan all the time ; season it, 
and add a spoonful of the liquid to every 3 of melted butter. 

White Sauce. — ^ a pint of cream, 2 tablespoon fuls of mush- 
room ketchup, 1 of essence of anchovy, with a little cayenne 
pepper, and an ounce or two of butter rolled in flour ; boil all 
together for 5 minutes. 

Brown Sauce. — Fry an onion in butter and flour until it 
becomes brown ; then simmer it in a glass of port wine, with 
a tablespoonful of soy and walnut ketchup, seasoned w ith salt 
and cayenne ; strain it, and thicken it with the necessary 
quantity of melted butter. 

Fish Sauce without butter. — Simmer very gently J pint 
of vinegar and ^ pint of water (which must not be hard), 
with an onion, .j a handful of scraped horseradish, 4 cloves, 2 
blades of mace, and ^ a teaspoonful of black pepper, lightly 
bruised. When the onion is quite tender, chop it small with 
2 anchovies, and set the whole on the fire to boil for a few 
minutes, with a spoonful of ketchup. Have ready and well 
beaten the yolks of 3 fresh eggs ; strain them, mix the liquor 

o 



290 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYII. 

\>y degrees with them, and, when well mixed, set the saucepan 
over a gentle fire, keeping the basin in one hand, into which 
toss the sauce to and fro, and shake the saucepan over the fire, 
that the eggs may not curdle. Do not boil them, only let the 
sauce be hot enough to give it the thickness of melted butter. 

Dutch Fish-sauce. ^^Vnt 2 blades of mace into 2 table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, boil it till reduced to 1 ; add the yolk of 
an eg^, mix it well together. Put to it i lb. of butter kneaded 
with flour, stir it over the fire, but do not let it boil. If it 
should curdle, a little cold water will smoothen it ag-ain. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

357. — Scald the oysters in their own liquor, beard them, 
strain the liquor, let it settle ; melt a piece of fresh butter, 
add flour sufficient to thicken the quantity of sauce, let it fry 
a little ; pour in the liquor of the oysters and sufficient cream 
to make it the required thickness ; add salt, cayenne, and the 
oysters. 

Or : — Beard the oysters, and put the beards with the liquor 
to stew for about i of an hour, together with a ])lade of mace ; 
then strain the liquor, put the oysters into it, and let thorn, just 
boil up, adding some butter which has been rubbed in flour 
and a little cream or milk ; but do not let them quite boil, or 
they will become hard. 

Or '. — To every dozen of oysters put 1 ounce of butter melted 
very thick, and diluted with the oyster-liquor, ^ a glass of 
"white wine, and veal broth, seasoned only with salt and a very 
little cayenne pepper. Sliould the oysters be of the large sort, 
they may be cut in half, which will afford the opportunity of 
removing the hard part contained in tlie centre. 

JBroivn Oyster-sauce is frequently served up with rump- 
sfealis. As the butter destroys the savouriness of the meat, 
the oysters, instead of being stewed in white sauce, should be 
dressed in strong beef-gravy, along mth a good portion of 
Ketchup, either stewed for a few minutes very gently, or put 
into an uncovered dish along with the gravy, and placed before 
the fire in a Dutch oven to brown. 2 dozen will fill a pint 
*ureen ; this sauce will also be found excellent as an accom- 
paniment to roast turkey. 

MUSCLE AND COCKLE SAUCES.

ing" care to deprive the muscle of a dark spot in the body, 
Avhich some people consider poisonous, and to well wash the 
cockles from sand. They may be equally used with codfisli, 
codling-, and haddock ; but the latter is most usually served 
with parsley and butter. 

LOBSTER SAUCE. 

359. — Pick the meat from a lobster and cut it into small 
pieces. Break the shell, and stew it with the legs, &c., in 1^ 
pint of water, until reduced to the quantity required ; then 
stram ; add flour and water to thicken it. Pound some of the 
live spawn from the tail, adding a little water to it; when 
well pounded pour it by degrees into the sauce ; let it boil 
up ; add fresh butter to it in the proportion of -r lb. of butter 
to a quart of sauce ; throw in the lobster : season with a little 
anchovy, cayenne, salt, and a small quantity of lemon-juice. 
It should be thick rather fiian thin. • 

Or : — Take a cold boiled hen lobster ; split the tail, and 
pound the coral, which is found in the tail and in the body, in 
a mortar, adding a little sweet oil. Then chop the meat af 
the body into very small pieces, and rub it, along with the soft 
parts and coral, through a sieve. That done, cut up the flesh 
of the claws and tail into dice, and stir the entire mixture 
gradually into the proper quantity of melted butter, without 
suffering it to boil ; as, if too much heated, the flavour and 
colour of the sauce will be injured. The seasoning should 
only be a moderate quantity of mace and cayenne, with i a 
glass of white wine, or a cup of cream, to a pint tureen of 
sauce. 

Crab Sauce is made in the same manner ; but crabs, being 
without coral, and the flesh less firm than that of lobster, form 
a rather inferior sauce. 

SHRIMP SAUCE. 
360. — Pick the heads and skins from some fresh shrimps, 
and stew these offals for ^ an hour in a small quantity of boil- 
ing water to extract their flavour ; then strain the liquor and 
make use of it in melting the butter in which the shelled 
shrimps are to be dressed.; these are then to be put into the 
butter and liquor to simmer gently for about 20 minutes, in 
which time they will be sufficiently done, and their flavour is 
so delicate that neither anchovy sauce, mace, cayenne pepper, 

o2 



1'92 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVII. 

nor any other condiment than salt, should be put to them ; add 
a little cream. 

A pint of unshelled shrimps will make a tureen of sauce 
large enough for 4 or 5 persons. 

Fresh-water Crayfish Sauce. — Pick out the fish and mince 
it in the same manner as lobster ; or, pound the shells and legs 
in a mortar, and after stewing them down to something like a 
pulp, then pass it through a sieve, and mix the whole together. 

SAUCE FOR STURGEON. 

361. — As this fish is generally stewed, the sauce is that in 
which it has been dressed; or, if either broiled or fried in steaks, 
any of the piquant store sauces may be used with wine and 
lemon-juice, thickened with cream and melted butter. 

SA UCES FOR CARP, PIKE, AND TENCH. 
362. — Hub i lb. gf butter with a teaspoonful of flour, put 
to it a little water, melt it, and add near i pint of thick 
cream, and i an anchovy chopped fine, not washed ; set it 
over the fire, and as it boils up add a large spoonful of real 
India soy. If that does not give it a fine colour, put a little 
more. Turn it into the sauce-tureen, and put some salt and 
■J a lemon : stir it well, to prevent its curdling. 

Sauce for Fried or Broiled Carp. — A gill of white wine, a 
couple of anchovies boned and minced, with an onion or two, 
and a little Seville orange or lemon peel, boiled in a teacupful 
of the gravy of either meat or fish, and then put into ^ lb. of 
butter, to which, when melted, the yolk of a raw e^^ may be 
added, and when it boils up squeeze into it the greater part of 
the lemon or orange juice. 

Or : — Anchovies, mushrooms, capers, and a shalot, all 
finely minced and stev/ed as above, with a little pepper and tlie 
juice of a lemon. 

Baked Pike and Tench may also be served with the sauces 
for broiled and fried carp ; or sometimes with only caper- 
sauce. 

Smelts, Sprats, Roach, Gudgeon, and Dace are always 
either fried or broiled ; and tlie best, sauce for either, if not 
used merely as a garnish, is the juice of a lemon with a little 
cayenne pepper, merely pulling off the heads of the smaller 
fish, and dipping the body in the juice. 



Chap. XVII. GEAVY, SAUCES, AND CUilRY. 293 

The juice of a lemon is also sufficient for ivhitehait ; but in 
all sour sauces the flavour of the Seville orange is preferable 
to the acidity of the lemon. 

SAUCE FOR EELS. 
363. — If the eels be spitchcocked in their skins, then some 
piquant sauce, as sauce a la tartare, is the best for correcting 
their richness ; but If stripped of their skins and covered with 
bread-crumbs, then plain melted butter, seasoned from the 
cruets, or any of the milder sauces in these receipts, are more 
appropriate. 

Boiled Eels are frequently served with capers, and some- 
times with sorrel sauce or parsley and butter ; and stewed eels 
have always the sauce in which they have been dressed. 

JELLY TO COVER COLD FISH. 
364. — Clean a skate, and put it into 3 quarts of water, with 
a calf's-foot or cow-heel, a stick of horseradish, an onion, 
3 blades of mace, some white pepper, a piece of lemon-peel, 
and a good slice of lean gammon. Stew until it will jelly ; 
strain it off : when cold, remove every bit of fat ; take it up 
from the sediment, and boil it with a glass of sherry, tlie whites 
of 4 or 5 eg^s, and a piece of lemon. Boil without stirring ; 
and after a few minutes set it by to stand h an hour, and strain 
it through a bag or sieve, with a cloth in it. Cover the fish 
with it wlien cold, lightly roughed. 



CURRIES. 

365. — Curry, which was formerly a dish almost exclusively 
for the table of those who had made a long residence in India, 
is now so completely naturalized, that few^dinners are thought 
complete unless there is one on the table ; it therefore becomes 
necessai-y to give a few hints, which will be applicable to every 
variety. It is of the first importance to procure good ''' curry"- 
powder ;" there are a great many receipts for making it, some 
of which we shall give, but the one most to be relied upon 
is prepared at Apothecaries' Hall, and called " Colonel Lys's 
curry-powder." — The rice also forms a very important part of 
a curry, and great care is required in boiling it. The " Patua" 
IS tlie best for this purpose. In India this dish is varied by the 



294 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVII. 

addition of green fruits and vegetables, which give a delicious 
acid and piquancy to it ; we are apt to rely too much upon 
turmeric and cayenne pepper for the flavour. The cocoa-nut 
is also a favourite ingredient in the Oriental curry. At those 
seasons when the cocoa-nut is fresh imported into England, a 
couple of ounces of a good sound nut, grated and stewed for 
an hour, would greatly improve a curry made of white meat. 
Cucumbers, vegetable marrow, spinach, tomata, celery, acid 
apple, peas, and almost any kind of green vegetables or fruit, 
might be added with advantage to different kinds of curry. 
The receipts here given have been selected as best suited to 
the English taste. Several others will be found under the 
several heads of the meats or material which distinguish them. 

To j^^'epare a Curry. — The meat should be fresh, and free 
from bone. Gut it into pieces v/hich can be easily served. To 
each pound of meat add a tablespoonful of curry -powder and 
about half the quantity of flour, and a little salt ; mix these 
together, and rub a portion of it upon the meat before it is 
fried, the remainder afterwards. Fry the meat in a little 
butter. Fry onions a light brown, with a clove of garlic if 
approved ; drain the fat from both the meat and onions ; put 
them into a stewpan, and cover with boiling water ; stew for 
20 minutes, then rub the remainder of the powder smooth 
with a little cold water, add it, and let it stew for an hour, or 
according to the time necessary for the meat to be well done. 
If no other acid is used, stir in a little lemon-juice just before 
serving : place it in the centre of the dish, and put a small 
border of carefully boiled rice round it ; sending up a separate 
dish of rice. 

C URR Y PO WDERS. 

366. — 1 oz. of ginger, the same of coriander-seed, ^ oz. of 
cayenne pepper, and 2 oz. of fine pale turmeric ; "" these in- 
gredients to be pounded separately to a fine powder, and then 
warmed by the fire and mixed together. Put the powder into 
a wide-mouthed bottle, cork it v/ell down, and put it into a dry 
place. 

Or: — 1^ oz. of mustard-seed scorched and finely powdered, 
4 oz. of coriander-seed pounded, 4^ oz. of turmeric, 3 oz. of

to a fine powder, and kept very dry. 

Bengal Ciirry-jiowder, — 4 oz. of coriander-seed, 2 oz. of 
cayenne pepper, 2 oz. of turmeric, 1 oz. of cumin-seed, 1 oz, 
of fennel-seed, 1 oz. of black pepper. To be well dried, 
pounded, and sifted. Lime or lemon juice should be added 
to this curry-powder when used. 

Sir H. Pottinger^s C^trry-poicder. — Take of turmeric- 
powder 2 oz., ginger-powder l^g- oz., white pepper 1 oz., carda- 
mom-seed ^ oz., coriander-seed 1^ oz., cumin 1 oz., fenugreek 

2 drachms, and cayenne pepper ^ oz. Mix these ingredients 
together, and keep the powder in a dry place. 

MODES OF BOILING RICE.—E. R. 
The great art in boiling rice is to keep every grain separate ; 
the pot should, therefore, be kept on a strong fire, so as to 
keep the water in a constant boil, as this motion will prevent 
the grains from sticking together. It should be left uncovered, 
and close attention is necessary on the part of the cook to 
M-atch the rice ; take it oflT the fire the moment it is done, strain 
and dry it immediately. 

367. — ^^Yash the rice well, and boil it in a large quantity of 
water : when a very little of the centre of the grain remains 
hard, take it off the fire, strain off -g- or more of the hot water, 
fill the saucepan with cold water, and shake the rice ; then 
strain all the vrater off, and the grain will separate ; place the 
pan of rice near the fire to swell, and the centre part of the 
grains will become tender."" 

^ This is a most excellent method of boiling rice, never failing to produce 
it in perfection. 



296 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYU. 

Or : — Take 1 lb. of rice, soak it for 4 minutes, then put it 
into 4 times its weight of boiling- water, and, when sufficiently 
done, drain off the water thoroughly, and replace the saucepan 
on the lire until the grains separate. 

Or : — AVash ^ lb. of rice in salt and water, then put it into 
2 quarts of boiling water, and let it boil briskly for about 20 
minutes, until the grains become tender, but not soft. Then 
strain it through a sieve, put the rice into a dish, and place it, 
uncovered, for a short time before the fire to di-y it ; when that 
IS done, send it up quite hot, either in a separate dish, or around 
the curry. 

THE KING OF OUDE'S CURRY. 

368. — Take ^ lb. of fresh butter, 2 large onions, a gill of 
good gravy (veal is the best), 1 large pressed tablespoonful 
of curry-powder ; add to these ingredients any kind of meaf 
cut into pieces. Put the whole into a stewpan, cover it close, 
and gently simmer for 2 hours. AYhen ready to serve up, 
squeeze as much lemon-juice as will give it an acid flavour. 

REN GAL CURRY. 

369. — Take a drachm of red pepper, 6 onions, and 1 oz. of 
coriander-seed free from the husks ; rub the seeds perfectly 
smooth in a mortar ; then add and pound the pepper and 
onions, mixing all well together. That done, set ^ lb. of 
butter in a stewpan on the fire, slice an onion into it, and, 
when the latter is brown, take it out, and put in 2 drachms of 
turmeric. Let it fry until the raw flavour goes oif; then mix 
-5- pint of curds with the pounded ingredients, and put the 
whole into the pan with the meat cut in pieces, 2 oz. of grated 
cocoa-nut, and a little salt. vStir the stew continually ; and, 
while the meat is getting brown, sprinkle water to prevent it 
from burning. 

LORD OLIVE'S CURRY.— E. R. 

370. — Slice 6 onions, 1 green apple^ and a clove of garlic ; 
stew them in a little good stock until they will pulp, then add 
1 teaspoonful of curry-powder, a few tablespoonfuls of stock, 
a little salt and a little cayenne pepper, i a saltspoonful of 
each ; stew in this gravy any kind of meat cut into small 
pieces, adding a piece of butter, the size of a walnut, rolled in 
flour. 

THE HASTINGS CURRY.— E. R. 

S71. — Brown \ lb. of fresh butter, slice 2 large onions, and

fry them. Cut fine the heart of a hard white cabbage, and a 
large sour apple ; put the whole into a stewpan, add a teaspocn- 
ful of cayenne pepper, 1 of black pepper, 1 of turmeric, the 
juice of i a lemon, and a gill of strong gravy. Cut up a 
fowl, flour it, add a little salt, put it with the rest of the in- 
gredients, cover it closely to keep in the steam, and let it stew 

for 3 hours. 

PRAWN CURRY. 

372. — Take a pint of prawns or shrimps, boiled and shelled, 
put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, with an onion finely shred, 
and 2 spoonfuls of curry-powder; stew them well together, 
and then put in the fi.sh. Have some spinach washed very clean, 
put it into a saucepan without any water ; when done enough, 
press the liquor from it, and add it to the butter, &c. ; stir it 
well together, taking care that it does not burn in the pan : if 
necessary, add a little water, for the ingredients must stew for 
a few minutes over the fire to amalgamate properly. 

HARD EGG CURRY. 

373. — Slice 2 onions and fry them in butter, add a table- 
spoonful of curry-powder ; let them stew in a pint of good 
broth till quite tender ; mix a cup of cream, and thicken wdth 
arro^M'oot or rice-flour. Simmer a few minutes, then add 6 or 
8 hard-boiled eggs cut into slices ; heat them thoroughly, but 
do not let them boil. 

Id AL AY CURRY, * 
374. — Blanch 2 oz. of almonds, fry them in a little butter 
till brown, but do not let them burn. Pound them to a cream 
with an onion and the rind of 4 a lemon. Cut up a chicken 
into joints. Mix a teaspoonful of turmeric and h the quantity 
of cayenne pepper in ^ a pint of water; put this with the 
chicken, almonds, &c., into a stewpan, and let it simmer for 
about 20 minutes ; then add a teacupful of cream, let it nearly 
boil, and before dishing squeeze in the juice of a lemon. 

HINDOSTANEE KUWAB FOWL.—E. R. 
375. — Kub smooth in a mortar -^ oz. of coriander-seed, 3 
onions, a drachm of red pepper, the same of pounded ginger, 
and 4 cloves. Put 4 oz. of salt butter on the fire in a stewpan. 
Sub a fowl inside and outside with the pounded ingredients ; 
truss it nicely ; put it into the butter, and fry it a fine brown, 
turning- it continually. This is a sort of salamander very

298 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVIIL 



acceptable to the lovers of fiery dishes : it should be eaten with 
lemon-juice squeezed over it. The butter may be converted 
into sauce ; but at many tables the fowl is served up dry in 
the dish. A small fowl is best for the purpose, it being* m.ore 
easily cooked. 

Or : — Skewer upon small silver skewers alternate slices of 
apple, slices of meat, cut into round pieces the same size, and 
halves of onions, so as to have 4 pieces of each, i. e. 12, on each 
skewer. To 2 lbs. weight take a drachm of turmeric, 4 onions, 
and a drachm of red pepper ; pound them in a mortar, sprinkle 
over, and fry them with the kuwab in a stewpan with i ib. of 
butter. Send up boiled rice in a separate dish. 



CHAPTER XVIII. 
VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 

VEGETABLES. 

376. — The fresher all green vegetables are used afrer ]){?ing 
taken from the ground the better; and therefore nothing- can 
be comparable to cutting them from your own garden ; but, 
when purcliased in^he market, care should be taken that those 
of the cabbage tribe should appear crisp and vividly green : 
not too small, nor yet overgrown in size. 

When about to be used, the outer leaves should be stripped, 
the stalks cut short, and the vegetable immersed for an hour 
or two in cold water, into which should be put a handful of 
salt, for the purpose of thoroughly cleansing it from slugs, 
and those insects with which the leaves are commonly infested. 
All green vegetables should be put into boiling water. ISTever 
boil any species of greens with meat. Boil them in plenty of 
pure water, with salt, to which a little vinegar may be added 
with advantage; do not cover the saucepan, but keep u}) 
a steady fire, so that they shall not be allowed to stop boiling 
until thoroughly done : drain them instantly, for if overboiled 
they lose their flavour and become insipid; they should be 
well done, for, if that be neglected for the purpose of pre- 
serving their crispness, they will be rendered indigestible. 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 299 

Hard water spoils the colour of such ^ egetables as should 
1)0 green, but a very small bit of soda or carbonate of ammonia 
will soften it, and even improve their brightness. The prac- 
tice of putting jt?c«r/<xs^fc in the pot, to improve their colour, 
should be strictly forbidden, as it imparts an unpleasant flavour ; 
as will also soda if not cautiously used. 

POTATOES 

377. — Require no attention for the preservation of their 
colour, but their flavour will be spoiled if their dressing bo 
not attended to, which, although of the most simple nature, is 
frequently ill performed. The best mode of doing it is to sort 
tlie potatoes, and choose them of an equal size ; wash them 
with a scrubbing-brush, and put them into cold water sufficient 
to cover them, and no more. About 10 minutes after the 
water has come to a boil, take out the half of it, and replace 
with cold water, to check it ; the reason assigned for which is, 
'• that the cold Avater sends the heat from the surface to the 
heart, and makes the potatoes mealy." Then throw in a large 
handful of salt, leave the pot uncovered, and let it remain 
upon the fire to simmer until the potatoes are done ; this is the 
moment to be watched, for, if overboiled, they will become 
waxy. The cook should, therefore, occasionally try them, by 
piercing them to the heart with a fork, and, when they are 
tender, the pot should be instantly taken off the fire, and tlie 
potatoes passed through a colander to drain • which being done, 
and the water thrown out, they should then be replaced upon 
a folded flannel, in the same pot, with a cloth put over them 
and the lid only half over ; they should be left by the side of 
tlie fire to keep hot and to cause the evaporation of the steam. 
AYhen served, they should be wrapped in a warmed cotton 
napkin. If of moderate size they will take about i an hour 
boiling, to which 10 minutes must be added for evaporation 
ere they can be sent to table. 

An iron pot is the best vessel for boiling potatoes in, since, 
c'J'ter the water has been poured off, it retains sufficient heat to 
dry them thoroughly. 

We here present a new invention for boiling potatoes by 
steam, which has been recommended. The machine may be 
found at most ironmongers', and goes under the name of 
'• Palmer's :" a shows the interior, and b the entire machine. 
The potatoes being placed over the boiler, the steam from the 



wo 



MODERN DOjilESTIO COOKEEY. Chap. XYIII 



water passes rapidly through the upper vessel, and, as it con- 
denses in the cone-shaped cover, passes off through an internal 
tube. 

By this ingenious and simple apparatus potatoes are cooked 
by steam only, thereby extracting and not adding (as is the 
case with all other steamers) to the main cause of the present 
failure in this important vegetable, viz. the superfluous moisture 
they possess. 





A good and economical mode of dressing potatoes, when 
-soup, meat, or other eatables are to be boiled, is to have a tin 
strainer fitted to the top of the saucepan, so as to allow the 

steam to ascend from the 
boiler. By which sim- 
ple contrivance a will 
boil the soup ; b, when 
fixed in the pot, will 
steam the potatoes ; and 
c, being the lid, will 
cover the whole, having 
a couple of small holes 
left in it to allow the 
steam to escape, in order 
to prevent it from fall- 
ing down upon the pota- 
toes. 

Notwithstanding the 




Iron Pot, with Potato Strainer. 



"directions here given for cooking potatoes, there is yet another 
point to which we have not adverted, and on which there exists 



CiiAP. XVIII. YEGETAEL^Ki AND Sx^LADS. 301 

great difference of opiniony that is, respecting the peeli?ig of 
the roots, whether before or aftei" their being boiled ? 

In Lancashire, where they are largely grown and admirably 
boiled, they are first peeled ; while in Ireland they are inva- 
riably brought to table " with their jackets on." Count 
Rumford also recommends their being boiled in their skins ; 
the " Cuisinier Bourgeois " likewise thinks that " les pommes 
de terre sont meilleures en rohe de chambrey 

The principles on which such opposite opinions are sup- 
ported are these : — The retention of the skin is upheld upon 
the supposition that, if it be taken off, the potato will imbibe 
the water and become waxy ; while, on the other hand, it is 
insisted that the potato, if peeled, hot only does not imbibe 
the water in v/hich it is boiled, but actually exudes the juice 
which it contains, and which is thought to be poisonous. 

On both these points we have made repeated experiments 
to discover any perceptible difference in the appearance of the 
root, which is always equally floury or waxy ; but we think 
that it retains a little more flavour when the skin is not taken 
off before boiling : that is, however, so trifling, that in our 
3wn practice we always peel them first, as being more cleanly. 
and avoiding the trouble of doing it when dinner is to be 
served, besides the chance of the potatoes being made cold. 

TO KEEP P O TA TOES. 
378. — Buy them as dug from the ground, without taking off 
the earth which adheres to them, and never wash them until 
wanted to be dressed. Place them in a dry cellar, upon straw, 
and cover them in winter with straw or mats, to guard them 
from the frost. 

NE JV POTA TOES 

379. — Should be dressed as soon as possible after being 
taken from the ground, and are always best when grown in 
frames. When washed, they should be rubbed with a coarse 
cloth and a little salt, to take off the thin outer skin, but they 
should not be peeled. Put them into boiling water, they will 
require but a few minutes to do them ; send them to table in a 
hot napkin, imless covered with white sauce, which should be 
seasoned with a little salt and a slight grating of nutmeg. 
When quite young they should never be sliced nor fried. 

POTATO-FLOUR. 
380. — Rasp the potatoes into a tub of cold water, and 



302 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVII I. 

change it repeatedly until the raspings fall to the bottom like 
a paste ; then dry it in the air, pound it in a mortar, and pass 
it through a hair sieve. It is nearly as nutritive, and much 
lighter than wheaten flour ; it is, therefore, preferable for 
making puddings and pastry for infants and invalids ; a portion 
of it also improves the appearance of household bread, and 
dealers constantly pass it off as arrowroot. If kept di'y, it 
will remain good for years. 

POTATO-JELLY 

381. — Is made from the flour, only boiling water must be 
poured upon it, but care must be taken that it be absolutely 
boiling, or the complete change into jelly will not take place. 
It does not take many minutes to thus change a raw potato 
into this substance, which is not only highly nutritive, but 
extremely agreeable to the palate when flavoured with a little 
sugar, nutmeg, and white wine. 

POTATO- WALL, 

382. — Or edging, to serve round fricassees, forms also a 
pretty addition to a corner dish. — J\lash in a mortar as many 
boiled potatoes as you may want, with a good piece of butter ; 
then, with the bowls of two silver spoons, raise a wall of it 2^ 
inches high within the rim of the dish to be used. Let the 
upper part be a little thinner than the lower ; smooth it ; and, 
after brushing it all over with e^^, put it into the oven to 
become hot and a little coloured. Before egging it, the out- 
side may be ornamented with bits of paste cut into shapes. 

TO 3IASH POTATOES. 

383. — Let them be thoroughly boiled, peel them, and take 
out all the specks and little hard lumps which are sometimes 
found. Beat them till quite fine in a wooden bowl or mortar, 
or break them thoroughly with a 3-pronged fork ; sprinkle a 
little salt, and mix them up smoothly with butter or boiling 
milk. Take care that the potatoes shall not be too wet, or 
they will become heavy and watery ; great smoothness, light- 
ness, and a rich taste are required in mashed potatoes : if 
required to be \'ery fine, rub them through a colander or sieve 
before adding the boiling milk and butter. 

Or : — As in India : Mash some potatoes, and, having boiled 
1 or 2 onions, chop them small, together with a few capsicums. 
Mix the whole well together ; put it into a mould, or form it 



Cpiap. XYIII. vegetables AND SALADS. 3C3 

with a spoon into a handsome shape, and warm it in an oven 
or upon a stove. 

OLD POTATOES TO LOOK LIKE YOUNG ONES. 
384. — Wash some large potatoes, and, with a small scoop 
made for the purpose, form as many diminutive ones as will 
till a dish ; boil them in 2 or 3 waters about 3 minutes each 
time, the water being put to them cold ; then let them steam 
till tender ; pour a white sauce over them, and serve with the 
second course. Old potatoes prepared thus have been mis- 
taken for young ones at the best tables. 

FOTATO-L OAVES 

385. — Are very nice v/hen eaten with roast beef or mutton, 
and are made of any portion of the mashed roots, prepared 
without milk, by mixing with them a good quantity of very 
finely minced raw shalot, powdered with pepper and salt ; 
then beating up the whole with a little butter to bind it, and 
dividing it into small loaves of a conical form, and placing them 
under the meat to brown, that is, when it is so nearly done as 
to impart some of the gravy along with the fat. 

TO BRO WN POTA TOES. 
386. — While the meat is roasting, and an hour before it is 
served, boil the potatoes and take off the skins ; flour them 
mtII, and put them under the meat, taking care to dry them 
from the dripping before they are sent to table. The kidney 
potatoes are best dressed in this way. The flouring is very 
essential. 

Potatoes, when boiled, if either waxy, or to be eaten with 
cold meat, should be peeled and put zvhole upon the gridiron 
until nicely browned. 

Potatoes should always be boiled a little before being put 
into stews, &c., as the first water in which they are cooked is 
thought to be of a poisonous quality. 

Pried Potatoes should always be cut from raw potatoes : 
peel them and cut them in rings the thickness of a shilling, 
or, if the cook is clever, she will cut the whole slice of potato 
in one continuous piece like a shaving, in the same way as a 
mushroom is turned ; throw them into cold water until you 
have sufficient ; drain on a cloth ; fry quickly, in plenty of 
hot flit, and with as little colour as possible ; dry them well 



S04 MODEPtX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVin. 

from the grease, and sprinkle with salt. When nicely done, 
and piled up projoerly, fried potatoes make a beautiful side 
dish, which is always eaten with great relish. 

Or : — Cut a potato in pieces lengthways the size and shape 
of the divisions of an orange, trim them neatly and fry them ; 
they are an excellent garnish for fried fillet of beef. 

Or ; — Cold Potatoes may be cut in slices somewhat less 
than ^ inch thick, and fried in like manner. Some persons 
also fry them with onions, as an accompaniment to pork chops, 
sliced cod, red herring, or with a rasher of bacon. 

ROASTED POTATOES 

387. — May be either done in a Dutch oven or put into the 
ashes of a wood fire. They should not be peeled, and require 
a long time : if large, and the fire not very strong, a couple of 
hours will not be too much. They are usually eaten with cold 
butter at supper. 

Potato-balls. — Bake the potatoes, mash them very nicely, 
make them into balls, rub them over with the yolk of an e^g, 
and put them into the oven or before the fire to brown. These 
balls may be varied by the introduction of a third portion of 
grated ham or tongue. 

POTATOES A LA 3IAITRE B' HOTEL.— E. R. 

388. — Boil and peel the potatoes; let them grow nearly 
cold; then cut them into slices tolerably thick, and warm 
them up in white sauce or melted butter, with parsley chopped ; 
put into it a little white pepper and salt, and the juice of ^ a 
lemon. 

Or : — Boil the potatoes, and let them become cold, then cut 
them into rather thick slices. Put a lump of fresh butter into 
a stewpan, add a little flour, about a teaspoonful for a moderate- 
sized dish ; when the flour has boiled a short time in the butter 
add a cupful of water and a little cream ; boil all together, 
then put in the potatoes covered with chopped parsley, pepper, 
and salt ; stew them for a few minutes, and then take them 
from the fire ; add a little lemon-juice, and send to table. 

PUREE OF POTATOES. 
389. — Mash the potatoes, and mix them while quite hot with 
some fine white gravy drawn from veal, together with butter 
and cream. The puree should be rather thin, and seasoned 
with salt, a very little pepper, and an atom of nutmeg. 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. aOo 

POTATO OMELETTE 
390. — May be made with a mashed potato, or 2 oz. of potato- 
flour and 4 eggs, and seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little 
nutmeg. It should be made thick ; and, being rather sub- 
stantial, a squeeze of lemon will improve it. Fry a light 

browQ. 

POMMES DE TERRE FARCIES. 

391. — Bake the potatoes ; and, when nearly done, cut off a 
circular piece from the upper part, and scoop out a portion of 
the pulp, leaving about an inch of thickness under the peel. 
Then have ready any well-minced fricassee or forcemeat you 
please, butter the inside of the potato, and fill up the cavity 
with the mince heaped to a round, touch it over with raw yolk 
of egg, and put the potatoes again in the Dutch oven, or brown 
them with a salamander. The skins should be rubbed with 
butter to render them crisp, or they will probably have become 
too hard to be peeled without breaking the potatoes, but if not, 
a portion of it should be cut off. 

GREEN PEAS.—E. R. 

392. — Boil them very fast in plenty of water with the lid off 
the stewpan ; the water should be moderately salted. They 
are unfit for eating when they become liard and yellowish, but 
when growing rather old a very small quantity of carbonate of 
ammonia put into the water, with 2 or 3 lumps of loaf-sugar, 
will greatly improve them. The old English method of putting 
a sprig of mint, or a little parsley, is still a good practice, and 
ought to be continued unless specially forbidden, or the mint 
may be chopped and put round the dish. A few bits of rav/ 
butter should also be put into the peas when boiled, and a dust 
of pepper and salt thrown over them if they be completely ripe ; 
but if quite young, neither butter, salt, nor pepper should be 
added to them, but a teaspoonful of pounded white sugar. 
When growing to maturity, the pods are of different ages, and 
young and old peas should not be boiled together ; sift them, 
therefore, from each other, and put the old ones into the water 
some minutes sooner than the young: they require from 15 lo 
20 minutes boiling. 

TO STEW GREEN PEAS. 
393. — Cut a cucumber in slices, and brown it in fried butter 
with 2 onions cut very small, to which put 1 quart of pea:?, a 



306 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Chap. XVIIL 

little pepper and salt. Let all stew slowly for an hour or more 
without any water, the stewpan being merely g-reased, or a bit 
of butter put in if the cucumber should not yield sufficient 
juice : when nearly done, add a teaspoonful of essence of 
ham : keep the pot closely covered while stewing. 

With Mint. — Take the hearts of 4 cabbage lettuces, cut 
them small, put them into a stewpan with 3 pints of young 
green peas and a little green mint chopped ; add pepper and 
salt ; then take a lump of butter the size of an egg, and mix it 
well with the vegetables, taking care not to bruise the peas ; 
then add 2 tablespoonfuls of pump water, a bit of ham, and a 
whole onion. Put them on the fire to stew until tender ; 20 
minutes will suffice, shaking the pan constantly to prevent its 
burning : when tender, take out the ham and onion, and add a 
piece more butter rolled in flour and i pint of cream ; boil all 
together for 5 minutes, and add a teaspoonful of pounded 
loaf-sugar. 

When old. — Steep them in water all night, if not fine boilers ; 
other^vise only ^ an hour : put them into water enough just to 
cover them, with a good bit of butter, or a piece of beef or 
pork. Stew them very gently till the peas are soft, and the 
meat is tender : if it is not salt meat, add salt and a little 
pepper. Serve them round the meat. 

TO PRESERVE PEAS FOR WINTER USE.^ 

394. — Shell, scald, and dry them: put them on tins or 
earthen dishes, in a cool oven, once or twice, to harden. Keep 
them in paper bags hung up in the kitchen. When they are 
to be used, let them lie an hour in water ; then set them on 
with cold water and a bit of butter, and boil them till ready. 
Put a sprig of dried mint to boil with them. 

3Ir. Apperfs inethod. — Have the peas gathered when ripe, 
for if too 3^oung they will be watery and not fit to keep. The 
peas, when shelled, should be put into strong jars or open- 
mouthed bottles, and shaken, so as to make them sit closely 
together. This done, the jars must be very tightly corked 
and tied down. The jars are then placed upright in a bain- 
marie, or any iron pot large enough to contain them, with hay 
placed between each, to prevent collision and breakage ; the 
i»ot is filled with cold water up to the neck of the jars, placed 

'• As rtractised in the kitchen of the Emperor of Russia. 



Chap. XYIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS, 307 

upon the fire, and allowed to boil for 1^ hour if in cool, moist 
weather, but for 2 hours if it be hot and dry. The jars should 
not be taken out of the pot until the water becomes cold. 

French beans and asparagus may be preserved in the same 
manner ; they maintain their colour, but lose much of their 
flavour, and require a little sugar to improve it. 

BROAD OR WINDSOR BEANS. 

395. — To hoil. — Shell them, boil them until tender, with a 
good handful of parsley, then strain them ; put a large piece 
of butter in the middle. Toss the beans by shaking the pan 
upwards, so as to mix the whole well together. Serve with 
parsley and butter in a boat. 

Broad beans may be dressed, when young, with their skins 
on ; but, if old, they should be hlanclied, which is done by the 
cook's removing the skin without breaking the beans, and then 
putting them, with a bit of butter, for a few minutes into the 
stewpan to warm. 

To stew. — Take them when too old to dress any other way, 
boil them, and remove the tough outer skin by peeling it oft 
after the beans are boiled ; thicken some white broth with a 
little cream or flour and butter, add the beans to it, and stew 
them all together over the fire for a few minutes. Add pepper 
and salt to palate. 

SPLIT-PEAS PUDDING. 

396. — Take any quantity, say 1 pint, of yellow split peas;* 
allow them to remain in water the whole night before you wish 
to use them ; after which, take them out and put them into a 
cloth so loose as to allow the peas to swell ; boil them for 4 
hours, or until they are Cjiuite tender, then rub them through a 
colander, so as to render them perfectly smooth ; add to the 
pulp a lump of butter and some salt. After being well mixed 
put the peas again into a cloth, tie tightly, and boil for about 
•^ an hour. Pour over it melted butter. 

Or : — Pick the peas cleanly, then tie them loosely in a 
cloth, and plunge them into water whilst it is boiling very 
quickly. In 2 hours they will be soft ; take them out and 
pound them in a marble mortar ; put in a lump of butter, a 
little pepper and salt, and tie them up very tightly in the cloth, 

" The meal made of peas and sold by all dealers saves much of the trouble 
of soaking and rendering the peas smooth. 



308 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYIU. 

vrliich should be well floured; let them boil 1 hour; pour 
meltttd butter over, and garnish with parsnips. 

A richer pudding may be made if 2 well-beaten eggs are 
added along with the butter. It is served with boiled pork. 

CARROTS AND PARSNIPS. 

397. — When young, wipe off the skin after they are boiled 
by drawing them through a cloth dipped in hot water ; when 
old, scrape them first, and boil them with the salt meat. They 
require to be well done. 

They are a constant accompaniment to corned beef, and are 
excellent when both are eaten together cold. They frequently 
also form part of stews and hashes, and make admirable sou]) 
when boiled down to a puree, in making which it should be 
observed that only the outer or scarlet rind of the carrot is to 
be used : the inner part should not, however, be lost, as it may 
be cut into small pieces and stewed. 

To stew Carrots. — Half boil, then nicely scrape, and slice 
them into a stewpan. Put to them -^ a teacupful of any weak 
broth, some pepper and salt, ^ a cupful of cream, and a salt- 
spoonful of powdered sugar : simmer them till they are very 
tender, but not broken. Before serving, rub a very little flour 
with a bit of butter, and warm up with them. If approved, 
chopped parsley may be added 10 minutes before serving. 

Carrots a la maitre d'hotel. — Boil the carrots tender. Put 
a lump of butter into the bottom of a stewpan with a little 
flour ; when it is brov/ned, add a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley and a little gravy : then put in the carrots, and let 
them stew gently till served. 

Carottes au Sucre may be also made as an entremet thus : — 
Slice them small, and put them into a stewpan, in only water 
enough to cover them, with the peel of a lemon and about half 
their own weight of sugar. Let this stew until the syrup is 
reduced and thickens ; then add the juice of the lemon, with 2 
tablespoonfuls of white wine, and serve. 

To mash Parsnips. — ^Boil them tender; rub the skin off; 
then mash them into a stewpan with a little cream, a good 
piece of butter, pepper and salt. 

To fricassee Parsnips. — Scrape them ; boil in milk till 
they are soft ; then cut them lengthwise into bits 2 or 3 inches 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 309 

long, and simmer in a white sauce, made of 2 spoonfuls of 
broth, a bit of mace, ^ a cupful of cream, a bit of butter, and 
iiome flour, pepper, and salt. 

TURNIPS 

398. — Should always be boiled whole, and put in much after 
either carrots or parsnips, as they require less boiling-. When 
used in stews, they are cut into small pieces of the size of dice, 
or made into shapes with a little instrument to be found at all 
cutlery shops. 

They may be mashed in the same manner as parsnips ; but 
some persons add the yolk of a raw egg or two. They are also 
frequently made into a. puree to thicken mutton broth. 

When quite yoiuig tliey should be served up whole, and 
most generally covered with white sauce ; but in France they 
are very commonly fried, and made an accompaniment to roast 
ducks, around which they are placed in the dish ; and, if not 
young, the old ones are cut into tliat shape. 

TURNIP-TOPS, 

399. — When fresh cut, are frequently used as greens, and 
preferred by many, as they contain a pleasant degree of bitter. 
They should be nicely trimmed, carefully washed, and boiled 
quickly, but not too much. 

BEET-ROOTS. 
400. — Wash and brush them, but they must not be cut, as 
that would interfere with the colour. Boil them in plain water, 
and let them be thoroughly done. They are used either as 
garnish for salad or may be sliced and served cold ^vith oil and 
vinegar. 

Stewed. — Boil the beet slowly, with the skin on, until tender. 
They will take at least an hour's boiling, but must not be tried 
by the fork, as the juice should not be allowed to run out. Take 
the skin off, then cut in slices J inch thick, put them into a 
stewpan witli a little broth and a spoonful of vinegar, and 
simmer till the gravy is tinged with the colour ; then put it 
into a small dish, and make a round of the button-onions, first 
boiled till tender. The flavour is richer and the colour finer 
when baked than v/hen boiled. 

Gv : — Bake it in an oven until it is quite tender, and, when 
cold, scrape off the outside coat, cut it in slices, and pour a 



310 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVIII. 

little vinegar over it ; then put it into a stewpan, and cover it 
v/itli gravy; stew gently for ^ an hour, and before serving 
thicken the gravy with a little cream. The sauce should be of 
a fine red colour ; and perhaps it would be advisable to pound 
one or two slices in a mortar, to extract the juice. 

CABBAGES 

401. — ^Are of various sorts and differently dressed, but the 
most common mode is plainly boiled. If the cabbage be large 
and old, or strong-flavoured, it will take an hour to boil. It 
should be boiled in 2 waters, removing the first when the cabbage 
is half done, and replacing it with an equal quantity boiling hot. 
The water should also be frequently skimmed. All green 
vesretables should be boiled uncovered. 

O 

Sprouts, or Greens, will be done in 15 to 20 minutes, but 
do not require skimming. 

Brussels Sprouts are a small species of cabbage, not larger 
than a walnut, and growing upon a tall single stalk. They are 
boiled in a few minutes, and may be served up either plain or 
covered with white sauce. 

Buttered Cabbage. — ^Boil the cabbage with a quantity of 
onions, then chop them together, season with pepper and salt, 
and fry them in butter. It is a rather homely but savoury 
dish, and frequently used either with fried sausages laid over 
it or as an accompaniment to roast beef, and forms part of 
bubble and squeak. 

For Red Cabbage, see Pickles. 

To stew. — Boil a large cabbage, press it dry in a cloth, then 
cut it very finely, adding pepper and salt, and a few chives or 
green onions, also boiled separately and well chopped ; put a 
lump of butter into a stewpan, let it melt, add the cabbage, and 
warm it together, stirring all the time ; add a spoonful of gra\y, 
and 1 of lemon-pickle, or the juice of ^ a lemon ; let it stew 
for a few minutes, and then serve it. 

OF LETTUCE 

402. — There are 2 sorts, the cabbage and the coss, both used 
in salads. 

Farcie a la Fran^aise. — Having cleaned the lettuces, tie 
them separately with a string, and boil them. Leave them 



Chap. XYIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 31 

to drain and cool ; then open the leaves and lay in farce or 
forcemeat between each leaf; tie them up carefully, and stew 
them g"ently in a braise made of thin slices of bacon, a carrot, 
an onion, a small bunch of sweet herbs, and a little good gravy. 
Skim the gravy, strain it, add a glass of white wine, reduce it, 
and let it be served quite hot. 

Or : — Take lettuces prepared as above, drain them tho- 
roughly, dip them in beaten egg and bread-crumbs, or make a 
batter the same as for thick pancakes, adding a glass of brandy ; 
allow it to remain 4 hours before it is wanted, then dip in the 
lettuces and fry them in lard. 

ONIONSj 

403. — Though all of the same species, are yet widely different 
in flavour, the Spanish being very mild and the English very 
pungent ; but their taste may be much diminished by boiling 
them in 2 or 3 separate waters. In buying the former, always 
choose the larger sort, as having been probably grown in the 
south of Spain or Portugal, where the finest sort are produced. 

To stew. — Peel, flour, and fry them gently of a fine brown, 
but do not blacken them ; then put them into a small stewpan, 
mth a little gravy, pepper, and salt ; cover and stew gently 
for 2 hours. 

Roast Onions should be done with all the skins on, and par- 
boiled before being put before the fire. They eat well alone, 
with only salt and cold butter, or with roast potatoes, and are 
better large than small. Though called " roast," the best way 
is to put them in a Dutch oven and turn them occasionally, so 
as to brown them equally. The half-grown, or smaller sort, 
are frequently dressed in this way, and served with roast mut- 
ton ; and in France they are very commonly put round a dish 
of roast fowl. 

Young Onions are generally eaten raw ; but chives, seal- 
lions, and shalot are mostly used for salads, or various modes of 
seasoning and pickles. 

Of all these condiments, garlic has the highest flavour, and 
if delicately used imparts a fine savour to various sorts of 
soups and sauces ; or if a clove of it be put into the shank of 
a leg or shoulder of mutton to be roasted, it will much im- 
prove its flavour. It is an excellent tonic, and is exten- 
sively used by the best cooks throughout the south of Europe ; 



312 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYIU. 

but in England a prejudice prevails against it, in consequence 
either of the strength of its odour, or more probably of the 
coarseness with which our cooks employ it. 

LEEKS 

404. — Are generally looked upon as a species of onion, and. 
as such, commonly employed in the same manner, though 
rather milder in flavour. If boiled in separate waters, changing 
it 3 or 4 times, until stewed quite tender, then served m 
white sauce, or quartered and placed upon toast like asparagus, 
they will eat nearly, if not quite, as delicate. 

SPINACH. 

405. — Wash it well in different waters, pick off the decayed 
leaves, and boil it quickly in a large quantity of water and 
salt for i of an hour ; when done, squeeze it very dry, chop it, 
put in the dish, and pour melted butter over it ; season it with 
pepper and salt. 

Or : — Boil it in as small a quantity of water as will prevent 
its burning to the pan; then strain and press it well; put it 
into a saucepan with a tablespoonful of gravy, a little pepper 
and salt, and a few drops of chili vinegar ; stew it for o 
minutes, chopping it all the time. The spinach may be boiled 
the day before, and is better for being so. 

Steiced icith Cream. — Boil the spinach as before directed, 
chop it very fine, and beat it well with a spoon, taking care 
to have picked out all the fibres ; put it into a stewpan witli 
a piece of butter, some pepper and salt, a little nutmeg, and a 
very small quantity of pounded sugar ; stir it well as it stews, 
adding by degrees as much cream as will make it the proper 
thickness. Garnish with fried paste. 

A la Frangaise. — Wash the spinach, and pick it very care- 
fully ; then put it into boiling water, and when sufiSciently tender 
to bear squeezing, strain it through a colander ; then throw it 
into cold water to preserve the colour. When it is quite cold, 
squeeze it in a towel, not in any large quantity at a time. Take 
out the stems, cliop the spinach very fine, and then put it into 
a stewpan with a piece of butter and some very rich gravy ;"" 
add pepper, salt, and a little mace or nutmeg, and boil it 
rather fast, stirring it all the time ; the thickness will depend 
upon the quantity of the sauce. It is also very generally 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 313 

dressed with cream and a little white sugar, as an entremet of 
great delicacy. 

It may be thus used alone, or with sippets, frequently with 
fricandeaux. A very pretty mode of serving it is to place it 
iii the centre of a small dish, with fried lamb chops around it, 
standing on end with the long bones meeting together. 

GOURDS AND POMP IONS. 
406. — The tops of all the edible species, boiled as greens or 
spinach, are a more delicate vegetable than the fruit. 

SEA-KALE 

407. — Is the earliest of our spring vegetables, coming into 
season a month or two before asparagus. It is extremely 
delicate, either plainly boiled as an accompaniment to house- 
lamb and white poultry, or served alone with white sauce, 
though a frequent mode is to bring it to table on toast, in the 
^ame way as asparagus : it takes the same time to boi] — about 
20 minutes. Trim the ends like celery, brush out the dust, 
tie up in bundles, boil for 20 or 25 minutes, lay the tops upon 
toast, and pour melted butter over it. 

ASPARAGUS. 
408. — Scrape the buds, and cut the white stalk off about 6 
inches from the head ; throw them into cold water, and after 
soaking tie them in small bundles, and boil them rather quicklv. 
If overdone, the heads mil be broken. Toast a slice of bread 
very brown on both sides ; and when the asparagus is done, 
take it very carefully up, dip the toast quickly in the water, 
and lay the heads upon it, leaving the white ends outwards 
each way, and pour melted butter over the toast and green 
parts. 

To Fricassee. — Scrape the asparagus clean, and, having- 
steeped it in cold water, cut off the eatable portion. To 50 heads 
add 1 head of endive, a young lettuce, and a few chives, all 3 
chopped ; put them into a stewpan with 2 oz. of butter ; shake 
the pan while the butter is melting, and then dredge in a little 
flour, and season with pepper and salt ; continue to shake the 
pan, and pour in a cupful of gravy ; stew the whole until the 
sauce is very rich and thick, and then serve it up. 

Farcis. — Cut a piece out of the top of 3 French rolls, take 
out all the crumb, do not enlarge the opening, or the crust will 

s 



314 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XV^JIJ. 

not exactly fit again. Fry the rolls brown, in fresh butter ; 
have ready a pint of cream, the yolks of 6 eggs well beaten, a 
little salt and nutmeg. Stir this mixture over a slow fire until 
it thickens. Boil a hundred of small asparagus ; save tops 
enough to stick the tops of the rolls with, cut the remainder of 
the green part of the grass small ; put it into the cream, and 
fill the rolls with it hot. Before the rolls are fried, make a 
fe^Y holes in the pieces of crust cut oft', and stick the tops in. 

This is for a side-dish in a second coiirse. 

In France asparagus is often eaten cold, as salad, with oil 
and vinegar. 

In the hop districts of England, the buds, and so much of 
the stalk or bine of the plant as will break off* short, are boiled 
and served up precisely as asparagus. 

In buying asparagus, the length of the green heads should 
be more looked to than their thickness. 

ARTICHOKES. 

409. — Cut the stalk even, trim off" a few of the outside leaves 
and the points of the others. If young, ^ an hour will boil 
them. Serve them Avith melted butter in as many small cups 
as there are artichokes, to help with each. 

Or : — Cut the artichokes in 4, remove the choke, trim the 
pieces neatly, boil them quickly in salt water, dish them, lay- 
ing the leaves outwards, and pour melted butter or white 
sauce over the bottoms. 

Steiued. — Strip oft" the leaves, remove the choke, and soak 
them in warm water for 2 or 3 hours, changing the water every 
hour ; then put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter 
rolled in flour ; a teacupful of gravy, and a spoonful or 2 of 
ketchup or other sauce ; add a spoonful of vinegar, or 1 of 
lemon-juice, before serving ; let all stew till the artichokes are 
quite tender, and, if necessary, thicken the sauce with a little 
more butter. 

Artichoke bottoms., if dried, must be soaked, then stewed in 
weak gravy, or baked and served with or without forcemeat 
in each. Or they may be boiled in milk, and served with 
cream-sauce ; or added to ragouts, French pies, &c. 

They may also be dipped in batter and fried, then served 
with a «auce made of fine herbs, a spoonful of oil, and the 
juice of lemon. 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 316 

A la Poivrade. — Take very small artichokes, cut them in 
quarters from the bottom, and remove the choke. Serve them 
in a little cold water, like radishes ; make a sauce with oil, 
vinegar, pepper, and salt : they have the flavour of nuts. 

Artichauts farcis. — Parboil the artichokes, remove the 
middle leaves, pare the choke, and stuff the centre with force- 
meat ; then put them into the oven until the meat is quite done. 
Serve up with melted butter. 

JER USALE3I AR TICHOKES 

410. — Should be boiled, putting them at first into cold 
water, and must be taken up the moment they are done, or 
they will be too soft. 

They may be boiled plain, or served with white fricassee- 
sauce. When boiled, if rubbed through a sieve with a little 
fresh butter and cream, they form an excellent puree as a sauce 
for cutlets, or as a thickening for some sorts of white soup ; or 
they may be sliced and fried. 

CUCUMBERS. 

411. — Stewed. — Peel them, slice them thick, or halve and 
divide them into 2 lengths ; strew some salt and pepper and 
sliced onions ; add a little broth, or a bit of butter ; simmer 
very slowly ; and before serving, if no butter was in before, put 
some, and a little flour ; or if there was butter in, only a little 
flour, unless it wants richness. 

Or : — Slice the onions and cut the cucumbers large ; flour 
them, and fry them in some butter ; then pour on some good 
broth or gravy, and stew them till done enough. 

Farcis. — Take full-grown cucumbers, peel them, divide 
them lengthwise, remove the seeds, and replace them with any 
sort of forcemeat, seasoned with a few drops of chili vinegar ; 
then tie them together with thread ; dip them in batter, and 
fry them. 

In Russia, cucumbers are preserved throughout the winter 
by being merely salted ; and they are commonly eaten raw, as 
in Er^land, but without vinegar, and unpeeled. 

VEGETABLE MARROW— E.R. 

412. — May be dressed in a variety of ways — plain-boiled, 
cut in slices, and served upon toast, with melted butter ; or 
stewed in a good gravy; or boiled and mashed in the same 

r2 



'616 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVIII. 

manner as turnips ; and if made rather thinner, with a little 
cream or fine white sauce, formed into a puree, to thicken soup. 
These purees, it must be remarked, should not, when made of 
the marrow or any other vegetable, be served up alone, but 
put into the middle of a dish, with chops or fried poultry of 
some kind, as they properly come under the denomination of 
sauce. 

To boil. — The smallest are considered the best, but when 
they are about 5 or 6 inches long the fruit is more mature, 
better flavoured, and the flesh whiter. Put them into boiling 
water with a little salt ; boil them gently till quite tender, 
and serve them, either whole or pared and halved, on a slice of 
bread toasted, with pla.in melted butter in a boat ; or when 
cold they may be pared and sliced, then dipped in a batter 
made with an egg, a teacupful of water or milk beaten togethei , 
a little salt, and about i lb. of flour, or sufficient to make the 
batter thick enough to adhere to the slices ; or they may be 
brushed over with egg, and covered with fine bread-crumbs, 
and then fried. Arrange them neatly on a dish, and serve 
with melted butter. 

Stewed. — Pare off the outer skin ; cut the gourd into slices 
and then into dice, taking out the seeds. Scrape a little fat 
bacon, which put into a stewpan with a small onion or two, and 
a little parsley chopped fine. Cover the stewpan close, and 
fry gently from 5 to 10 minutes ; then thicken with a spoonful 
of flour, and add a little veal broth to make the sauce the con- 
sistency of rich cream. Season with pepper and salt, replace 
the cover, and stew gently until quite tender. A mushroom 
chopped small may be added. 

TO STEW CELERY. 

413. — Wash the heads, and strip off their outer leaves ; either 
halve or leave them whole, according to their size, and cut 
them into lengths of 4 inches. Put them into a stewpan 
with a cup of broth or weak white gravy ; stew till tender ; 
then add 2 tablespoonfuls of cream, a little flour and butter, 
seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a little pounded white 
sugar ; and simmer all together. 

Or : — Parboil it, cut it into quarters, fry it, and serve it on 
a napkin, or with beef gravy. 

Celery is a great improvement to all soups and gravies, and 
much used as a white sauce, either alone or with oysters. 



Chap. XYIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 317 

TO BOIL CAULIFLOWERS. 

414. — Choose those that are close and white, cut off the 
green leaves, and look carefully that there are no caterpillars 
about the stalk ; soak an hour in cold water, with a handful of 
salt in it ; then boil them in milk and water, and take care to 
skim the saucepan, that not the least foulness may fall on the 
flower. It must be served very white, and rather crimp. 

In White Sauce. — Take off the whole of the leaves of a 
cauliflower, and half-boil it ; then cut it into handsome pieces, 
and lay them in a stewpan with a little broth, a bit of mace, a 
little salt, and a dust of white pepper ; simmer h an hour, but 
let the stalk be put down J of an hour before the flower ; then 
put a little cream, butter, and flour ; shake, and simmer a few 
minutes, and serve. 

With Parmesan. — Boil a cauliflower ; drain it on a sieve, 
and cut it into convenient sized pieces ; arrange these pieces 
in a pudding-basin so as to make them resemble a cauliflower 
when turned on the dish : season it as you proceed ; turn it on 
the dish, then cover it with a sauce made of grated parmesan 
cheese, butter, and the yolks of a couple of eggs, seasoned with 
lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; and put parmesan 
grated over it. Bake for 20 minutes, and brown it. 

Or : — Boil sprigs of cauliflower in butter and water to make 
them white, until they are tender ; then grate i lb. of parmesan 
cheese ; put nearly ^ into a stewpan with i lb. of butter, a little 
white pepper, and 2 spoonfuls of milk ; toss it until the cheese 
is well mixed, then warm the cauliflower in it, and serve it up 
with the remainder of the cheese strewed over the top. 

BROCOLI 

415. — Is dressed in nearly the same manner : cut the heads 
with short stalks, and pare the tough skin off" them. ; tie the 
small shoots into bunches, and boil them a shorter time than 
the heads. Some salt must be put into the water. Serve 
with or without toast. 

Poached eggs eat well with brocoli. 

BROCOLI AND BUTTERED EGGS. 

416. — Keep a handsome bunch for the middle, and have 8 
pieces to go round ; toast a piece of bread to fit the inner part 
of the dish or plate ; boil the brocoli. In the mean time have 



318 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XVIIL 

ready 6 (or more) eggs beaten ; put, for 6, i lb. of fine butter 
into a saucepan, with a little salt ; stir it over the fire, and, as 
it becomes warm, add the eggs, and shake the saucepan till 
the mixture is thick enough. Pour it on the hot toast, and 
lay the brocoli upon it. 

FRENCH BEANS. 

417. — Cut off the ends and stalks ; divide in half, or shred 
them, according to fancy ; lay them in salt and water, and, 
when the saucepan boils, put them in with some salt. As soon 
as they are done, serve them immediately, to preserve the 
green colour. 

Or : — When half done, drain the water oiF, put them into 
2 spoonfuls of broth strained, and add a little cream, butter, 
and flour ; stew gently till tender. 

Scarlet Runners, though less delicate, are by many pre- 
ferred to French beans. They are boiled in the same manner 
for "l- of an hour or 20 minutes ; and when tender, a good 
homely way of preparing them for the table is to place them 
for some short time in the dripping-pan under any meat that 
is roasting ; add pepper and salt ; or, when boiled, mince and 
stew them in beef gravy. 

To boil, or rather simmer, as gently as possible, the seed of 
the dwarf scarlet runjier. — Boil in soft water, for, should the 
water be hard, they will take 4 hours ; and unless they are 
stewed gently, they will break and be spoiled. Put an onion 
shred fine into a stewpan, with a piece of butter rolled in flour ; 
let it stew until tender, then add the beans to it, with a little 
hot water ; stir it until it simmers together for a few -minutes ; 
then add a little salt, a tea or dessert spoonful of vinegar, a few 
chives or a shalot minced fine, and a suflficient quantity of 
parsley to give it a green colour. vServe up the beans very 
hot, either in a covered dish or under roast mutton. 

3IUSHR0 03IS. 

418. — Cooks should be perfectly acquainted with the dif- 
ferent sorts of things called by this name by ignorant people, 
as the death of many persons has been occasioned by carelessly 
using the poisonous kinds. 

The eatable mushrooms at first appear very small and of a 
round form, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, and the 
upper part and stalk are white. As the size increases, the 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 319 

under part gradually opens, and shows a fringed fur of a very 
line salmon colour, which continues more or less till the mush- 
room has gained some size, and then turns to a dark brown. 
These marks should be attended to, and likewise whether the 
skin can be easily parted from the edges and middle. Those 
that have a white or yellow fur should be carefully avoideci, 
though many of them have the same smell, but not so strong 
as the right sort. 

To stew. — The large buttons are best for this purpose, and 
the small flaps while the fur is still red. Rub the buttons 
with salt and a bit of flannel ; cut out the fur, and take off the 
skin from the others ; put them into a stewpan with a little 
lemon-juice, pepper, salt, and a sfhall piece of fresh butter, 
and let the whole simmer slowly till done ; then put a small 
bit of butter and flour, with 2 spoonfuls of cream ; give them 
one boil, and serve with sippets of bread. 

To fricassee. — Peel the mushrooms, which should be large, 
and broil them on a gridiron. When the outside is brown, put 
them into a stewpan with a little milk ; when they have stewed 
10 minutes, add a spoonful of white wine and the same of 
browning ; thicken it with butter and flour, and serve it up 
garnished with sippets. 

To broil. — The largest are the best. Have a clear cinder 
fire ; make the gridiron hot, and rub the bars with suet to pre- 
vent the mushrooms from sticking ; place them also on the 
gridiron with their stalks upwards ; sprinkle them slightly 
with salt and a good shake of pepper, and serve them on a hot 
dish, with a little cold butter under and over them. When 
they begin to steam they are sufficiently done. 

To make a Puree of Mushrooms. — Cut off the stems, but 
retain the heads and cleanse them. Put a little water into a 
stewpan, and squeeze into it the juice of a lemon ; put in the 
heads and drain them ; mince them as fine as possible ; put a 
piece of butter into a stewpan ; squeeze the juice of a lemon, 
and add to it the minced mushrooms. Keep it on the fire 
until the butter is melted ; then add 6 spoonfuls of strong 
gravy, and the same of thick wliite sauce ; reduce it until the 
puree is sufficiently thick ; add a little pepper, and serve it 
up ; or keep it for flavouring sauces, which it will greatly 
improve. 

ilaving thus disposed of the heads ^ then take the stems for 



320 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYIII. 

buttered mushrooms, or champignons au beurre. Rub them 
vath a little salt to clean them, and rinse them in salt vv-ater ; 
after which dry them with a cloth, and have ready about 2 oz. 
of fresh butter to every pint of stems. Put the butter into a 
stewpan over a cinder fire, until it begins to brown; then 
throw in the stems, and keep the pan on the fire for a few- 
minutes until they become tender, continuing to shake them 
all the time, to prevent them from burning, and the butter 
from becoming oiled. Pile them in a small dish, and serve them 
in their own gravy, than which nothing can be finer. 

Some cooks flavour it with mace, and others, still more in- 
judiciously, with cayenne, either of which utterly spoils it. 

TRUFFLES, 
419. — Although enumerated among vegetables, are yet not 
known to be capable of cultivation, but are found under ground 
by pigs and dogs trained for the purpose. When sold in the 
^hops they are of different qualities — the lohite, the red, and 
the black — and are, therefore, generally thought to be of dif- 
ferent species ; but the difference arises from the period of 
their ripeness, as they are always dug up the moment they 
are found, and the black, being the most mature, always bear 
the highest price. Their chief use is to add a high flavour to 
sauces, farces, and pies, as -^ oz. simmered in a pint of gravy 
will greatly improve them. They are also frequently em- 
ployed to stuflP poultry. Morels are used for the same pur- 
poses. 

Stewed. — Wash and brush clean the truffles, put them in a 
stewpan with a little wine, a slice or two of fat bacon, and 
a little good broth ; let them boil gently until quite tender ; 
then serve tliem in a napkin dry, as you would roasted chest- 
jmts. 

FRIED HERBS (as in Staffordshire). 

420. — Clean and dry a good quantity of spinach-leaves, 
2 large handfuls of parsley, and a handful of green onions. 
Chop the parsley and onions, and sprinkle them among the 
spinach. Set them all on to stew, with some salt, and a bit of 
butter the size of a walnut : shake the pan when it begins to 
grow warm, and let it be closely covered over a close stove 
till done enough. It is served with slices of broiled calf's 
liver, small rashers of bacon, and eggs fried ; the latter placed 
on the herbs, the other in a separate dish. 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 321 

HARICOTS BLANCS—E. R. 
421. — Are the seeds of the white French bean. Though 
but little known in England, they are a very common dish 
throughout France, where they are generally stewed and 
served with white sauce. They come to us in a dried state, 
and therefore are capable of keeping for 12 months, beyond 
which time it is not desirable to keep them, as they then require 
■ so much soaking that the flavour is destroyed. They always 
require a few hours' soaking before being dressed ; the usual 
mode in this country is to put them into cold water, boil them 
for an hour, and send them to table in plain white sauce, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, or sometimes with chopped parsley 
and a few grains of sugar. 

A V Hollmidaise. — Pick and well clean the haricots ; put 
them into a pot witii cold soft water and a bit of butter. 
While on the fire, add cold water to soften and prevent theii 
boiling. When well softened, drain them ; put them into a 
saucepan with a bit of butter and some boiled and strained 
onions cut in dice, a little highly-seasoned gravy-soup, salt, 
and coarse pepper. Shake them well, and finish with a little 
more butter. 

Spanish receipt for Haricots Blancs, or Garhanzas. — Pour 
hot water on the beans, and soak them for 24 hours ; then boil 
them with some lettuce or parsley, and a little ham, till they 
are tender. Then fry some chopped onions and a little bit of 
garlic, and put them in a pot. A few minutes before they are^ 
wanted pound some toasted bread with some of the beans; 
tlien mix them with an ^^^^ add spice, and pour them into the- 
pot ; warm and send them up to table. 

TO BRESS CHESTNUTS FOR DESSERT. 

422. — Let them be well roasted, and the husks taken off. 
Dissolve i lb. of sugar in a wineglassful of water, and the 
juice of a lemon. Put this and the chestnuts into a saucepan 
over a slow fire for 10 minutes ; add sufficient orange-flower 
water to flavour the syrup ; serve in a deep dish, and grate 
sugar over them. To be handed round whilst quite hot. 

TO DRESS CARDOONS, OR CHARD ONS. 

, 423. — Cut them into pieces of 6 inches long, scrape them as 
asparagus, tie them in bundles, boil till tender, and have ready 

p3 



^22 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XVIIL 

a piece of butter in a pan ; fiour, fry them brov/n, and serve in 
a rich brown sauce. 

Or : — Boil in salt and water, dry, then dip them into batter, 
and fry them. Serve with melted butter. 

Or : — Parboil, and then stew in brown or white graAy ; 
add cayenne, lemon-juice, and salt. Thicken with a bit of 
butter and flour, have a marrow-bone boiled, cut the marrow 
in slices, and stre^^' over the top of the chardons. 

SALSIFIS, SKIRRETS, AND SCORZANERA, 

424. — Are not much known in England, though all good, 
and deserving of more general cultivation. The salsifis are 
white, and not unlike small parsnips, and ripen the first year, 
whilst scorzanera is black, arid requires 2 years in coming to 
perfection ; but it is preferable of the two. In flavour they 
somewhat resemble Jerusalem artichokes. They are much 
cultivated in France, and appear in the markets as a very late 
winter or early spring vegetable. 

Scrape them and throw them into water with a little lemon- 
juice squeezed into it to keep them white ; boil in milk-and- 
v/ater ; serve with melted butter or white sauce ; or stew them 
in rich brown gravy ; or, when boiled tender, dip in batter 
and fry quite crisp. 

TOMA TA, 

425. — Or " love-apple," is now coniing very generally, and 
deservedly, into use, either pickled, made into ketchup, or 
served alone. 

There are two species of tomatas at present cultivated in 
this country, the red and the yellow. 

The time of their ripening is from the middle of August to 
October, or until the frost sets in, which mostly destroys them. 
The large red are much esteemed for stewing or eating, though 
for pickling and preserving the smaller varieties are by some 
considered preferable. 

They make an excellent puree, and may be either ste^ved, 
or roasted in a Dutch oven for 1 of an hour, and form a good 
accompaniment to any roast meat, as they contain a very deli- 
cate flavour of acidity. 

A few tomatas, when simply stewed in a little gravy, sea- 
soned only with salt, or mixed with a little celery, are a very 
pleasant vegetable ; if not very small, 3 or 4 will be sufficient 
■hx a moderate party. 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 32S'. 

To steto. — Slice the tomatas into a well-tinned stewpan,. 
seasoning them with pepper and salt ; place bits of butter over 
the top. Put on the lid close, and stew gently for about 20 
minutes. After this stir them frequently, letting them stew 
until they are well done. A spoonful or two of vinegar ^\\\\ 
be considered an improvement by many. Excellent v/ith roast 
beef or mutton. 

Or : — Put in only sufficient tomatas to cover the bottom of 
the saucepan, add gravy or broth to nearly cover them, let 
them stew very gently until well done ; then strain off the 
gravy, thicken it with butter mixed ^vith flour, put the tomatas 
on a dish, and pour the gra\'y over. 

To hake. — Slice them into a baking-dish ; season, put butter 
over in bits, and strew bread-crumbs on the top. Bake them 
Ibr about f of an hour in a m-oderate oven. 

To stuff. — Cut them in halves and hollow out the centre ; 
take whatever cold meat may be at hand, either chicken, par- 
tridge, or hare, with ham, &c., onions, fine herbs, crumbs of 
bread, and form a forcemeat-ball v/ith beaten eggs ; fill up the 
centres of the tomatas, and let them stew gently in any gravy ; 
before serving up, pass them over with a salamander or hot 
iron. 

A favourite mode of dressing them in Portugal, Avhere they 
are largely grown, is, to stew them along v/ith rice and onions 
in strong brown gravy ; the rice forming the greater portion 
of the dish. Tiiere are also various other ways employed 
throughout the Continent, but garlic should never be added, 
as it destroys the delicacy of the tomata. 

SA UER KRA UT, 

426. — Or Sour-crout, as it is called in this country, is a 
German preparation of cabbage, fermented in layers, between 
which salt is laid, and the whole pressed closely down with 
weights for a few days, at the end of which it becomes acid, 
and the greater part of the juice is dra'WTi off. 

In preparing it, the outward leaves and the stalk are removed,, 
the latter being sliced, and the v/hole cabbage cut into small 
pieces, which are pressed heavily down, and placed in barrels 
in a v/arm cellar until the fermentation is over : when that is 
complete, put the kraut into a cool place, and it will remain 
good for years. Some people think it improved by a mixture 



324 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XYIK. 

among the layers of carraway, whole pepper, and juniper- 
berries, or the barrels smoked with the latter. 

It is extensively used throughout the northern parts of 
Europe, as a pleasant vegetable, particularly with salted meats 
and sausages ; and is considered so excellent an antiscorbutic 
that it is largely employed in our navy. It requires nothing 
but care in the making ; and, when properly prepared, may 
be served at any gentleman's table. Boil it for 2 hours, and 
skim the water ; or change the water for gravy, and stew it. 

CHIC ORE E, OR EX DIVE, au Veloute.—E. R. 

427. — Take off the exterior of the endive, leaving nothing 
but the white ; let it lie in water to soak ; have it thoroughly 
washed ; then throw a haadful of salt into a kettle of boiling 
water, keeping the endive under the water to prevent its turn- 
ing black ; when it will mix with the water it is blanched ; tiy 
with the finger it it be tender, and, if so, drain it on a sieve, 
and put it in cold spring water ; when perfectly cold, strain it 
again, and squeeze it quite dry. Chop it, put a good piece of 
butter in a stewpan with the endive, a little salt and pepper ; 
put in some veloutc ; let it reduce till it becomes thick; send 
it up with croutons. 

SORREL 

428. — Forms an excellent accompaniment for young meat, 
or for anything the flavour of which is improved by its acidity, 
and is used very commonly in France, both as sauce and as a 
separate dish, prepared vvith cream in the same manner a:s 
spinach. 

Or : — Take any quantity of the leaves, washed clean, boil 
them tender in water, and pass them through a tamis ; put 
them into a stewpan with a slice of fresh butter and a few 
spoonfuls of white sauce ; add salt and a little sugar. 

There are two sorts of the plant, the French and English ; 
the former bearing a small round leaf, and the latter mucli 
longer, as well as duller in colour : the French is much the 
best. 

VEGE TA BLE RAGOU T.—E. R. 

429. — Cut cold potatoes, carrots, turnips, cabbage, onion.'^-, 
and any other vegetables at hand into slices ; put them into a 
stev/pan. with pepper and salt, a little broth, and a piece of 
butter, and stir them together with a spoon until they are quite 



CiiAP. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 325 

hot. In India a portion of the vegetables is taken from each 
dish, chopped up while hot with pepper and salt, and put into 
a silver saucepan, with a piece of butter ; and, when well 
heated over a lamp, sent round the table. 

A VEGETABLE OLIO. 

430. — Boil 3 heads of small, close cabbage, carrots, turnips, 
potatoes, and small onions ; drain them from the water, and 
out them in pieces. Mix all with 2 handfuls of spinach- 
leaves, 2 oz. of butter, 3 spoonfuls of cream, a little salt and 
pepper, and stew them as closely covered as possible 2 hours ; 
then stir in a bit of butter rolled in flour, over a clear fire. 

In summer, peas, cucumbers, spinach, celery, lettuces, and 
young onions may be dressed the same way. 

BREBIC OF VEGETABLES (a Dxitch dish).—E. R. 

431. — Brown 4 or 6 onions sliced and chopped in a little 
butter, tlien add different kinds of vegetables chopped, which 
have been previously boiled ; stew them all together, stirring 
the whole time. When half done, add a few tomatas sliced, 
with chilis also sliced, and salt to the taste ; moisten if neces- 
sary with gravy, and either add a glassful of vinegar or a 
handful of sorrel. 

VEGETABLE CURRY.— E. R. 

432. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stewpan, then roll celery, 
onions, and brocoli in curry-powder, and stew them until 
tender ; add a cupful of good gravy, a small quantity of mashed 
potatoes mixed up with curry-powder, and salt. Stew the 
whole together until sufficiently done. 

Or : — Take brocoli, cauliflower, or any other vegetable, 
and boilit in water until tender; then throw out the water, 
cut them in rather large pieces, and add either slirimps, 
prawns, or any minced meat, if you think proper to make 
such an addition ; or if not, then put some fried onions with a 
bit of butter, a pint of water, and the usual quantity of rice 
and curry-powder ; stew all together and add lemon-juice to 
the taste. If the materials be well chosen, it will be found 
\'ery delicate. 



326 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XVlll. 



SALADS. 

433. — 111 this country salads are almost always eaten as an 
accompaniment to meat, and, being composed of green vege- 
tables, are seldom brought to table in winter ; but on the 
Continent other preparations are introduced under that deno- 
mination. 

Coss-lettuce and blanched endive make the best salad, the 
green leaves being stripped off, and leaving nothing but the 
close, white hearts, which, after being washed and placed for 
an hour or two in cold water, should be wiped quite dry. To 
this should be added a head or two of celery, a couple of an- 
chovies (which are far preferable to the essence), and several 
chives, or young onions, all cut small, while the lettuces should 
be divided lengtlnvise into quarters, and cut into rather large 
pieces. 

T/ie mixture or dressing. — For 4 persons bruise only the 
yolk of 1 hard-boiled ^^'^ (leaving out altogether the white), 
with some salt, and make it into a paste with 2 large tea- 
spoonfuls of rtioidarde de 3Iaille, or any French mustard ; or^ 
if obliged to use common mustard, add to it a drop or two of 
asafoetida, which will impart to it a slight flavour of garlic. 
Then add oil and vinegar in the following proportions, with- 
out using so much as to make the sauce thin, and taking care 
to have the finest Provence or Lucca oil, and the very strongest 
species of real French vinegar : namely, to every 1 spoonful 
of vinegar add 2 of oil ; 1 spoonful of the vinegar being im- 
pregnated with chilis, which will add warmth to the salad, 
much more agreeably than cayenne. A little of tarragon may 
be an improvement, and a spoonful of Quihi or walnut ketchup 
is not objectionable ; but mushroom ketchup will destroy the 
pungency of flavour, and both may be left out without incon- 
venience. 

When this is done, mix the sauce well, but lightly, with the 
salad, to which a few slices of boiled beet-root, and the white 
of the e^g sliced, will be a pretty addition. 

Kitchener's Salad Mixture, which is sold in the oil-shops 
ifi bottles ready prepared for use, is also very good, though 
not equal to that freshly made as above. 

Some people, particularly the French, eat lettuces without 
any other sauce than oil and vinegar, and, when eaten in tliat 



Chap. XVIII. YEC4ETABLES AND SALADS. 327 

simple way, a little sugar is certainly an improvement. But 
althougli these proportions of oil and vinegar are stated, as 
above, to suit the English palate, it must yet be observed that 
in France the quantity of oil used in salads is invariably mucii 
more than double that of vinegar. 

The excellence of a salad consists in the vesretables being- 
young and fresh, and they should be prepared only a short 
time before they are wanted ; the salad mixture being either 
poured into the bottom of the bov/1 or sent up in a sauce- 
tureen, and not stirred up vritli the vegetables until they are 
served. 

In summer salads the mixture must not be poured upon 
the lettuce or vegetables used in the salad, but be left at the 
bottom, to be stirred up when wanted, as thus preserving the 
crispness of the lettuce. 

In winter salads, how^ever, the reverse of this proceeding 
must be adopted, as thus : the salad of endive, celery, beet, 
and other roots being cut ready for dressing, then pour the 
mixture upon the ingredients, and stir them well up, so tliat 
every portion may receive its benefit. 

In doing this, it should likewise be recollected that the 
spoon and fork should always be of wood, and of sufficient 
size to stir up the vegetables in large quantities.^ 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

434. — Pull the meat off the bones of a cold fowl or chicken, 
put it into a small pan with a shalot cut in thin slices, a few 
sprigs of parsley, and a tablespoonful each of oil and tarragon 
vinegar ; season the chicken well with pepper and salt ; let it 
soak for about 3 hours. Boil 3 eggs hard, cut them in 4 
pieces lengthways ; chop 2 anchovies, 6 olives, and a dessert- 
spoonful of capers ; take 3 lettuces, reserve the small hearts 
to garnish with, cutting them in 4, shred fine the other leaves 
that are white, and cut roughly some small salad ; put a layer 
of salad on the dish, then the chicken, sprinkle the chopped 
anchovy, &c., then more salad and chicken until you have 
used up the whole of your materials ; then mask it with a

improved if the dish can be placed on pounded ice whilst it is 
being" prepared. 

The remains of veal and wliite foultry, when minced and 
left cold, instead of being fricasseed, will thus be found an 
excellent addition to the dinner of a summer's day, with added 
slices of cucumber. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

435. — Break out the meat from a lobster ; slice the tail ^ an 
inch thick. Marinade it in oil and vinegar for 2 hours ; have 
some lettuce and small salad shred ; make a layer at the bottom 
of the dish ; put over that a layer of the lobster, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, repeating it until the dish is piled up. Make 
a border of hard-boiled eggs, cut in quarters round the dish, 
interspersed with sliced beet-root and cucumber, and a few 
fillets of anchovy. Pour over the top, when sending to table, 
some mayonnaise sauce. 

Crab, or shri?nps, may be used in the same manner ; and 
a great improvement in either will be found by throwing in a 
portion of savoury calf 's-foot jelly, divided into pieces. 

Although shell-Jish are very decidedly the best mixture to 
be put into this salad, yet any sort of firm flat-fish, as turbot, 
brill, John-dory, or soles, Avhich have been dressed, and left 
cold, may also be prepared in a similar way. 

French Salad. — Chop 3 anchovies, a shalot, and some 
parsley small, put them into a bowl with 2 tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, 1 of oil, a little mustard, and salt. When well 
mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled meat in very 
thin slices ; put in a few at a time, not exceeding 2 or 3 inches 
long. Shake them in the seasoning, and then put more ; cover 
the bowl close, and let the salad be prepared 3 hours before it 
is to be eaten. 

Italian Salad is made by picking the white portion of a 
cold fowl from the bones in small flakes, piling it in the centre 
of a dish, and pouring a salad mixture over, enriched with 
cream ; make a wall around with salad of any kind, laying the 
whites of the eggs, cut into rings, on the top in a chain. 

Spanish Salad. — Take whatever salad can be got, wash it 
in many waters, shake it in a small net, or in napkins, till 
nearly dry, chop up onions and tarragon, take a bowl, put in 
equal quantities of vinegar and water, a teaspoonful of peppei* 



Chap. XVIII. VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 329 

and salt, and 4 times as much oil as vinegar and water ; mix 
the same well together ; take care never to put the lettuce into 
the sauce till the moment the salad is vranted, or it loses all its 
crispness and becomes sodden. 

On which Mr. Ford quotes a Spanish proverb which says, 
'' To make a good salad four persons are wanted, — a spend- 
thrift for oil, a miser for vinegar, a counsellor for salt, and a 
madman to stir it all up." 

Vegetable Salads, made of roots which have been boiled, 
also make good winter salads, amongst which potato salad is 
perhaps the best. Cut the roots into thin slices, season them ' 
^vith pepper and salt, and pour over them the salad mixture, 
to which may be added, if the flavour be not disapproved, a 
few slices of raw onion. 

For Vinaigrette. — Take any kind of cold meat, chop it 
finely, and lay it in a dish; chop the whites of the eggs 
employed for the salad very finely with small onions ; add 
any kind of herb, and pickled cucumbers, all chopped finely : 
make a garnish round the meat, serve it with salad mixture, 
but do not stir it together, as it would spoil the appearance of 
the dish, which looks very pretty with the eggs and herbs in 
a ring. 

Beet-root, celery, Spanish onions, carrots, and brocoli may 
also in winter be cut small, and served with the same mixture 
as that employed for vegetables in their raw state. 

In sunnner, purslain, an herb formerly much cultivated in 
England, is an excellent ingredient among the many raw 
materials ; and tomatas boiled, left until cold, sliced, not very 
thin, and eaten either with or without onions and any other 
vegetable, also make a very nice salad, in either summer or 
winter, as they may be preserved nearly the whole year round. 

When very delicately made, cream or melted butter is 
sometimes sulDstituted for oil in salads, as many persons object 
to oil as disagreeing with their stomachs ; but, in point of 
richness, its flavour is generally thought superior.

CHAPTER XIX. 
SAUSAGES AND FOECEMEAT. 

SAUSAGES. 

436. — Sausages are composed of raw meat finely chopped, 
highly seasoned, and usually filled in small skins prepared for 
that purpose, although they may be made equally well without 
them. They may be made of a variety of meats, porli and beef 
being the most common — seasoning of course varying according 
to the taste of the maker. By many persons they are preferred 
rolled in balls, and then flattened in the hand, and fried either 
with egg and crumbs or not. The best way of keeping sausage- 
meat is to pack it in a clean, dry jar, kept in a cool larder. 

Common Sausage-meal. — Take any quantity of lean beef 
or pork, with half the quantity of fat, and having freed the 
lean of every particle of skin, sinew, and gristle, then mince 
both it and the fat as fine as possible ; putting to each pound 
of meat a large teaspoonful of pepper and the same quantity 
of salt ; strew this on the meat, and mix the whole thoroughly 
together, as a stock for seasoning other meat. 

Take 6 lbs. of meat, fat and lean ; cut the fat into small 
pieces, and pound tlie lean portion in a mortar, Avith 2 table- 
spoonfuls of salt, 1 of moist sugar, a teaspoonful of saltpetre, 
and 2 tablespoonfuls of mixed spices. To this may be added 
the grated peel of a lemon, and a small portion of sage and 
thyme, well chopped. 

Or : — To the meat of a leg of pork of about 4 lbs. weight 
add 2 lbs. of fat from the fore loin, cliop both very fine ; then 
add 2 nutmegs grated, 20 cloves, a teaspoonful of pounded or 
grated lemon-peel, 2 or 3 blades of mace pounded, 1 oz. of the 
best salt, and ^ oz. of black pepper ; mix all together and stufl^ 
it into the skins, which should be well cleansed and salted the 
night before. This sausage-meat would be much improved for 
immediate use by pounding the meat and mixing it with a third 
portion of white bread soaked in milk and also pounded, blend- 
ing the whole together with a beaten egg. 



UiiAP. XIX. SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. o'31 

BEEF SAUSAGES, 
437. — Though not nearly so good as those of pork, yet, if 
made at home, may be found a pleasant and economical mode 
of using the scraps of raw meat. Proceed as for pork sausage.-. 

MUTTON SAUSAGES.— E. R. 

438. — Take a pound of undressed mutton, or that whicli 
has been underdone, chop it very small, and season it M"ith 
pepper, salt, and beaten mace. Chop also ^ lb. of beef suet. 
"2 anchovies, a pint of oysters, \ lb. of grated bread, and a 
boiled onion ; mix the whole with the oyster liquor, and the 
M'hites and yolks of 2 eggs well beaten ; pound the whole in a 
mortar. Roll into lengths, cakes, or balls, and fry them. 

THE CAMBRIDGE SAUSAGE. 

439. — Cut into small pieces 1 lb. of pork, the same quantity 
of beef suet, 1 lb. of beef and veal in equal parts, ^ lb. of 
bacon fat, and h lb. of the gammon. Chop very finely a 
handful of sage-leaves, and add to them a fourth part of sweet 
herbs. Season the whole with mixed spice, adding a spoonful 
of cayenne pepper, and a due quantity of salt. Let the skin 
be well cleaned ; fill it, and tie it tightly. Put it into a 
saucepan of boiling water, pricking it first to prevent its burst- 
ing, and allow it to boil 1 hour. 

AN EXCELLENT SAUSAGE TO EAT COLD. 

440. — Season fat and lean pork with some salt, saltpetre, 
black pepper, and allspice, all in fine powder, and rub into the 
meat ; the sixth day cut it small, and mix with it some shred 
shalot or garlic, as fine as possible. Ha^'e ready an ox-gut that 
has been scoured, salted, and soaked well, and fill it with the 
above stuffing ; tie up the ends, and hang it to smoke as you 
would hams, but first wrap it in a fold or two of old muslin. It 
must be high-dried. Some eat it without boiling, but others 
like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in different places, 
so as to make each link about 8 or 9 inches long. 

OXFORD SA USA GES.—E. R. 

441. — Take 2 lbs. of lean pork, the same quantity of lean 
veal, 1 lb. of suet chopped very fine and beaten in a mortar, 
with a French roll just wetted through with milk, ^ oz. of 
pepper, a little salt ; mix all these ingredients well together, 



332 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKER i'. Ch.vp. XIX. 

and pot it. "When wanted, beat up 4 eggs, mix the sausage- 
meat up in it, roll it into egg-shapes, and fry in a dn^ hot pan 
over a very quick fire. The eggs must only be added the day 
the sausac-e-meat is used. 

Another. — Take 1 lb. of young pork, fat and lean, ^yithout 
skin or gristle, 1 lb. of lean veal, and 1 lb. of beef suet. Chop 
all fine together ; add ^ lb. of grated bread, ^ the peel of a 
lemon shred fine, a small nutmeg grated, 6 sage-leaves washed 
and chopped "sery fine, a teaspoonful of pepper and 2 of salt, 
savory, and marjoram shred fine. 

O YS TER SA USA GES.—E. R. 

442. — Take 1 lb. of veal and a score of oysters bearded, 
then pound the veal very finely in a mortar with a little suet, 
season with a little pepper, soak a piece of bread in the 
oyster-liquor, pound, and add it with the oysters cut in pieces 
to the veal ; beat up an e^^ to bind them together, and roll 
them into little lengths, like sausages ; fiy them in butter a 
delicate brown. 

Or : — Take t lb. of lean mutton or beef, with f lb. of beef 
suet, and two score of oysters bearded. Mince the whole and 
add bread-crumbs, with 2 yolks of eggs to bmd the materials 
together. Season Avith salt, white pepper, a little mace, and 
mushroom powder. 

Put it either in skins, or fry the sausage-meat of a light 
brown in small pieces. 

VEAL AXD POULTR Y SA USA GES. 

443. — Sausages may also be made of the remains of veal, 
turkey, ovfoicl. which have been dressed. Of either of these 
put equal quantities of meat and bread-crumbs, with half that 
of ham, seasoned with parsley, lemon-thyme, and chives. Mix 
the materials wich a little pepper, salt, and pounded mace, the 
yolk of an egg, and ^ a teaspoonful of flour ; make it up as 
sausages or small rolls to garnish fricassees or minced meat, or 
as a nice supper dish, piled round a sweetbread. 

Or : — Chop equal quantities of lean veal and fat bacon, a 
handful of sage, a little salt and pepper, and a few ancho\-ies, 
beat all in a "mortar; and when used, roll and fiy it, and 
serve it with fried sippets, or on stewed vegetables, or on 
white collops. 



Chap. XIX. SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. 333 

FOWL OR RABBIT SAUSAGES.— E. R. 

444. — Take the remains of a fowl, rabbit, or hare ; wlien 
boiled or roasted, free it from the bones, and cut it small. 
Boil some onions in strong gravy ; when the onions are quite 
soft, pound them, season with salt, pepper, parsley, 2 cloves, 
and a blade of mace ; pound the meat also, cut some bacon 
into small pieces, and add it. Mix up these ingredients with 
the yolk of an egg, add a little lemon-juice or lemon-pickle, 
or chop a little sorrel with the herbs, fill the skins, and broil 
them. 

Such are the sausages usually made in this country, and 
most commonly eaten fresh ; but, on the Continent, many 
sorts are made of a rather large size, seasoned in different 
modes, and smoked, with the intention of keeping them good 
for a long time, as the Brunswick, Bayonne^ and Bologna, 
which may always be found in the foreign oil-shops in 
England. There is, however, another kind, which we do not 
recollect to have ever seen in London, though constantly used 
throughout the Peninsula. 

SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE SAUSAGES 

445. — Are made from the fat and lean of the back and loins 
of a well-fed two-year-old hog, cut into small pieces of less 
tlian ^ inch square, and then either finely minced or pounded 
together, and strongly seasoned with cloves of garlic and green 
or red capsicums or chilis ; but as these cannot always be con- 
veniently procured in this country, cayenne-pepper . may be 
substituted. The whole should then be covered with any sort 
of strong, dry mue, until absorbed by the ingredients, ^\•hich 
will occupy perhaps a few days, according to the quantity. 

Fill the largest skins you can get Avith the meat, fat and lean 
alternately, occasionally adding some of the wine. Tie up in 
links, and hang them in a room where they vnll not get damp 
or become too dry, and they will keep 12 months. 

They are sometimes fried, and eaten either alone or as a 
relish with poultry, but more frequently put into stews ; and, 
in Spain, always boiled along with the olla, under the name of 
" Chorisosr 

BLA CK P UD DINGS. 

446. — The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a 
quart of it, or rather more, to a quart of whole grits, to soak 
one night ; and soak the crumb of a quartern loaf in rather 



S34 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIX. 

more than 2 quarts of new milk made hot. In the mean time 
prepare the skins by washing-, turning-, and scraping, with salt 
and \vater, and changing the water several times. Chop fine 
a little winter-savory and thyme, a good quantity of penny- 
royal, pepper, and salt, a few cloves, some allspice, ginger, 
and nutmeg ; mix these with 3 lbs. of beef-suet, and 6 eggs 
well beaten and strained ; and then beat the bread, grits, &c., 
all up with the seasoning : when well mixed, have ready some 
hog's fat cut into dice, and, as you fill the skins, put it in 
at proper distances. Tie in links only half filled, and boil in 
a large kettle, pricking them as they swell, or they will burst. 
When boiled, lay them between clean cloths, or upon stravr, 
till cold, and hang them up in the kitchen. When to be used, 
scald them a few minutes in water, wipe, and put them into a 
Dutch oven. 

If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing into basins, 
and boil it covered with floured cloths ; and slice and fry it 
when used. 

Or : — Soak all night a quart of bruised grits in as mucli 
boiling-hot milk as will swell them and leave h pint of 
liquid. Chop a good quantity of pennyroyal, some leaves of 
sage, savory, and thyme, with salt, pepper, and allspice 
finely powdered. Mix the above with a quart of the 
blood, prepared as before directed ; then half fill the skins, 
after they have been cleaned thoroughly, and put as much 
of the flare (that is, the inward fat) of the pig as will 
make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed. A small 
quantity of leeks, finely shred and well mixed, is a great 
improvement. 

WHITE F UDDINGS.—E. R. 

447. — To 2 parts of beef-suet chopped add I part of 
oatmeal previously toasted before the fire ; boil an onion or 
2, and chop them with pepper and salt ; mix the whole well 
together, put the ingredients into skins, and boil them for an 
hour, pricking them as they boil to prevent their bursting. 
They will keep for some time in bran after they have been 
allowed to become cold. Parboil them when wanted, and 
then broil them on a gridiron. 

The quantity of suet may seem disproportioned to the oat- 
meal ; but unless there are two-thirds of the former to one of 
the latter, the puddings will be dry and bad. They require 
to be highly seasoned with pepper and onions. 



Chap. XIX. SAUSAGES AND FOKCEMEAT. ?.3o 



FORCEMEAT. 

French cooks pride themselves, and very justly, on the pains 
which they bestow on the elaboration of their forcemeat, or 
farce. It is an art in which they have attained superior 
excellence, but in which there is no great difficulty. 

At many tables, where everything else is well done, it is 
very common to find indiflerent stuffing or forcemeat. A 
general fault is, that the tastes of lemon-peel and thyme over- 
come all others, therefore they should only be used in small 
quantities ; and except in a few very savoury dishes, cayenne 
and pepper of all kinds should be sparingly used. No one 
flavour should predom.inate greatly : yet if several dishes be 
served the same day, there should be a marked variety in the 
tastes of the forcemeats as well as of the gravies. 

The forcemeat should be consistent enough to be cut with a 
knife, but not dry and heavy. Herbs are a very essential in- 
gredient, and it is the copious but judicious use of them that 
chiefly gives the cookery of the French its superior flavour. 

Bacon or butter must always be substituted for suet when 
the forcemeat is to be eaten cold. 

The flavour given to the bread, or panada, is considered 
to be of great importance, and the highest point of perfection 
may be obtained by attending to the following directions ; — 

PANADA. 

448. — Put into a small stewpan 1 oz. of fresh butter, a table- 
spoonful of chopped mushrooms, a little chopped thyme and 
parsley, i a blade of mace, pepper and salt ; stew the whole 
over the fire for a few minutes, then add to it a spoonful of 
white broth, the crumb of 2 French rolls previously soaked in 
milk and squeezed thoroughly dry ; stir over the fire until it 
no longer adheres to the stewpan ; take it ofl", add the yolks of 
2 eggs, turn it out and leave it to cool : it is then ready for 
use. 

UDDER. 

449. — Boil a calf s udder in broth or water ; when cold, trim 
off the outside, pound, and rub through a sieve. 

QUENELLE. 
450. — This is one of the most delicate preparations of force- 
nisat that we have, and requires practice, care, and attentioii 



336 MODERN DOMESTIC OOOKERY. Chap. XIX. 

to make it in perfection. It is called according to the meat 
of which it is composed : quenelles of rabbit, chicken, fisli, or 
game. 

Take the meat of 2 rabbits, pound it and rub it through a 
sieve ; take one-third less of panada and also of udder or very 
sweet fresh butter, pound these for I of an hour, add a 
tablespoonful of white sauce, 2 eggs, and 2 yolks; take a 
small piece, roll it in a ball, and throw it in l3oiling water ; 
when done it should cut firm and consistent, yet light and 
delicate ; if more seasoning is required it should be added 
before it is taken out of the mortar. 

To mould them : have 2 tablespoons, fill 1 with the farce, 
shape with a knife, dipping it in boiling water to make it 
perfectly smooth ; dip the other spoon in hot water, with which 
take out the quenelle and lay it in a buttered stewpan ; they 
should be egg-shaped, and perfectly smooth, and boiled for i 
of an hour. 

Panada for Fish Quenelle^ or Forcemeat. — Put two-thirds 
of \ pint of water into a stewpan holding a quart, with nearly 
1 oz. of butter ; when boiling, stir in \ lb. of flour ; keep it 
moving over the fire until it forms a smooth and tough paste. 
Take it off" the fire, add the yolks of 3 eggs. When cold, use 
it where directed. 

FORCEMEAT. 

451. — Take 1^ lb. of lean veal, pound it, and pass it 
through a sieve ; 1 lb. of chopped beef suet, and 6 oz. of 
panada, pounded well together ; add the veal, season with 
pepper, salt, and a little nutmeg ; mix well ; then add the 
yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; when these are thoroughly 
mixed, whisk the other 3 whites of eggs to a very stiff froth, 
and add it to the forcemeat ; when all is well mixed together, 
it is fit for use. 

Another. — Take equal quantities of cold chicken, veal, and 
beef, shred very small, and mixed together ; season with a mode- 
rate quantity of pepper, salt, sweet herbs, and grated nutmeg, 
if intended for whitomeat, or for anything delicately flavoured ; 
but if meant for a savoury dish, add a little minced ham, and 
an atom of garlic or a shalot. Put the whole in a stone mor- 
tar, and pound it (ipiite fine ; then make it into a paste with a 
raw ^^<^ and a small quantity of butter. When used, it may 
either be rolled into round balls and fried for any made dish, 



CiiA?. XIX. SAUSAGES AND FORCEMEAT. SS7 



or put into any joint of meat or poultry as stuffing ; and if 

kept in a cool place, and well seasoned, it will keep good for 

several days. 

FARCE CUITE.—E R. 

452. — Cut in small pieces some undressed fowl; put them 
into a stewpan with a piece of butter, a little salt, pepper, and 
a little nutmeg ; shake them over the fire for 10 minutes, drain, 
and let them cool. Put an equal portion of crumbs of bread 
in the same stewpan with some broth, and a little parsley 
chopped fine ; stir it with a wooden spoon till it becomes quite 
soft. Let it get cold, then pound the fowl until it will pass 
through a tamis ; pound the bread also, and put it tln'ough 
the sieve; then put equal parts of the meat, butter, and bread 
together, and pound them with yolks of eggs sufficient to make 
it into a proper consistency, and keep it in a jar for use. 

FARCE OF VEAL AND HAM.—E. R. 

453, — Bacon and veal which have been used in braising, or 
anything highly impregnated with the fla\our of herbs and 
onions, and very rich, may be employed afterwards as a farce, 
pounded and mixed with panada. 

Shred a little ham or gammon, some cold veal or fowl, 
some beef-suet, a small quantity of onion, some parsley, very 
little lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg or pounded mace, and either 
white pepper or cayenne, and bread-crumbs. Pound it in a 
mortar, and bind it with 1 or 2 eggs, beaten or strained. For 
forcemeat patties, the mixture as above. 

Or : — Mince equal quantities of ham and veal ; put it in a 
stew-pan with chopped parsley, a very little thyme and knotted 
marjoram, pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg ; let it stew very 
gently. Pound it fine, add bread-crumbs in the proportion of 
three parts farce to one of bread-crumbs, and sufficient yolks 
of eggs to bind it. 

STUFFING. 

454. — Take equal quantities of beef-suet and crumbs of 
bread ; chop the suet very finely ; chop together marjoram, 
thyme, and parsley, having as much parsley as there is thyme 
and marjoram together ; add to them a saltspoonful of grated 
lemon-peel, pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg ; add eggs 
sufficient to bind it together. 

JFo7' Hare^ or anything in imitation of it. — The scalded 
tiver, an anchovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, some parsley, 

Q 



S38 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XIX, 

thyniQ, knotted marjoram, a little slialot, and either onion or 
cMves, all chopped fine-; crumbs of bread, pepper, and nut- 
meg, beat in a mortar with, an egg. 

I^'ish FGvcemeat. — Cliop, and afterYvTirds poimd in a mor- 
tar, any kind of fisb, adding an anchoA^ or two, or a 
teaspoonful of the essence of anchovies, but do not allow the 
taste to prevail, and the yolk of a hard-boiled o^^^. If for 
maigre, pound butter with it ; but otherwise, the fat of bacon 
pounded separately, and then mixed. Add a thii-d portion 
of bread, prepared by soaking and pounding previously, and 
mix the whole up vidth raw eggs. For mackerel, pike, 
haddock, and soles, take the veal forcemeat, add a little 
anchovy essence, and use rather less herbs. 

Oyster Forcemeat. — Take a dozen natives, strain them from 
the liquor, mince them, and add i lb. of finely-grated bread- 
crumbs, 1^ oz. of butter broken very small, a dessertspoonful 
of parsley, the grated rind of ^ a lemon ; season with a little 
mace, cayenne, and salt ; mix v^ell ; then bind together with 
the yolk of an egg unbeaten, and a little of the oyster liquor. 
Care must be taken that the oyster flavoiu' predominates. 

Seasoning for Stuffing. — 1 lb. salt dried and sifted, i oz. 
ground white pepper, 2 oz. dried thyme, 1 oz. dried marjoram, 
and 1 oz. nutmeg. Yv'hen this seasoning is used, parsley only 
is requii'ed to be chopped in sufficient quantity to make the 
stuffing gTcen. The proportions are — i lb. bread-crumbs, 
3 eggs, \ lb. suet, ^ oz. seasoning, and peel of i a lemon 
gi'ated. This preparation of herbs will be found very useful, 
and also good flavoui-ed if kept in a closely-corked bottle. 

FORCEMEAT BALLS FOR SOUP MAIGRE. 

455. — Forcemeat balls for meagre soups of any description 
should be always used to compensate for the savour of which 
they are deprived by the want of meat-broth ; and may be 
made of fish and sweet herbs, or only of herbs and crumbs 
of bread, in the following manner : — ■ 

Pound in a mortar the soft pai-ts of a crawfish, or a few 
shrimps, with an ahcho^^, and the yolk of a hard-boiled 
egg, beaten up with crumbs of stale bread, pounded mace, 
cayenne pepper, salt, and a very little finely -mmced garlic. 
Then work it up into a paste with a raw egg to bind it into 
dough; roll it out, cut it into small balls of the size of 
raarblos, and fry them of a fine brown. 



CiiAP. XIX. SAUSAGES AXD FOECEMEAT. 339 

Or : — Leave out tlie fisli, and make them entirely of bread 
and savoury cliopped lierbs — cliervil, tarragon, marjoram, 
and thyme, with a little garlic and a shalot — and hind them 
up as above, with egg, butter, and crumbs of bread. 

Or : — Chop, and afterwards pound in a mortar, any kind of 
fish, adding an anchovy or two, or a teaspoonful of the es- 
sence of anchovies, but do not allow the taste to prevail, and 
the yolk of a hard-boiled egg ; pound butter with it ; add a 
third portion of bread, prepared by soakmg and poundmg 
previously, and mix the whole up v/ith raw eggs. 

Or ; — Beat the flesh and soft parts of a middling-sized 
lobster, half an anchov}^, a large piece of boiled celery, the 
yolk of a hard egg, a little cayenne, mace, salt, and v^^hite 
pepper, with 2 tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, 1 ditto of 
oystei'-liquor, 2 oz. of butter warmed, and 2 eggs long beaten : 
make into balls, and fry of a fine broTvi:! in butter. 

Or : — Take a few sin-imps stripped of their shells, an 
anchovy, and the jOlk of a hard-boiled egg, with bread- 
crumbs and seasoning as above, but adding some finely-minced 
sv/eet herbs, and omitting the oyster-liquor ; make all this 
into a paste with a little butter and a raw egg, made up in 
balls and fiied as before. 

Or : — Instead of makmg the balls of fish and frying them, 
it is a more simple way to make them merely of bread- 
crumbs, hard-boiled egg, and sweet herbs seasoned with rav/ 
egg : drop the balls, one by one, into the boiling soup a few 
minutes before serving. 2 eggs and i lb. of bread should 
make 12 or 15 balls. 

Or : — Pound in a mortar, into a smooth substance, an 
anchovy, the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, a head of boiled 
celery, and some sweet herbs, mth 2 tablespoonfids of bread- 
crumbs, seasoned with mace, a gTating of nutmeg, cayenne, 
and salt ; then add 2 oz. of butter melted, and work it into 
a paste with a little flour, and the yolk of a raw egg ; mako 
it into l:)alls the size of mai-bles, and fry them quite brown.

456. — 1 lb. of fine fresh suet, 1 lb. of ready dressed veal or 
chicken chopped fine, crumbs of bread, a little shalot or onion, 
salt, white pepper, nutmeg, mace, pennyroyal, parsley, and 
lemon-thyme, finely shred ; beat as many fresh eggs, yolks and 
wliites separately, as will make tha above ingredients into a

moist paste ; roll into small balls, and boil them in fresh lard, 
putting them in just as it boils up. When of a light brown, 
take them out, and drain them before the fire. If the suet be 
moist or stale, a great many more eggs will be necessary. 

Balls made this way are remarkably light; but, being 
greasy, some people prefer them with less suet and eggs. 
They maj^ therefore be made thus :— Chop up the materials 
with a little white pepper and salt, a sage-leaf or two scalded 
and finely chopped, and the yolk of an e^^ ; make them into 
small cakes or fritters, and fry them. 

Eggs for Turtle. — Beat 3 hard yolks of eggs in a mortar, 
and make into a paste with the yolk of a raw one ; roll it into 
small balls, and throw tliem into boiling water for 2 minutes 
to harden. Though formerly much used, they have latterly 
gone out of fasliion. 

PASSOVER BALLS FOR SOUP.-E.R. 
457. — Chop an onion and ^ lb. of suet very finely; stew 
them together until the suet is melted, then pour it hot upon 
8 spoonfuls of biscuit-flour ; mix it well together ; add a little 
salt, a little grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger, and 6 
eggs. Put the balls into the soup when it boils, and boil them 
for \ of an hour. The quantity of eggs and flour may appear 
disproportioned, but the flour employed is of a peculiar kind, 
used for the purpose in Jewish families. Nothing can exceed 
tlie excellence of the balls made after this receipt : they are 
applicable to any kind of soups. 



CHAPTER XX. 
CURING BIEAT, POTTING, AND COLLARING. 

CUEING. 

458. — In salting meat care should be taken to remove the 
kernels, otherwise it will soon become tainted. It should be 
sprinkled with a handful of common salt to fetch out the 
'nlood, the brine thrown away on the following day, and the 
meat wiped with a dry cloth ; it is then ready to be cured in 



Chap. XX. CUEING MEAT. 341 

an}^ of the undermentioned ways. Too much care cannot be 
taken in the first salting to rub between every muscle or 
under every fiap of the meat, as for want of this care it may 
have an unpleasant taste, though sufficiently salted. The 
brine will serve again, by being boiled and skimmed, which 
may be repeated as long as any scum will rise. Hams should 
be laid with the rind-side downwards ; and it is a good })lan 
to heat i peck of common salt in a frying-pan and lay it at 
the bottom of the pan. A small quantity of saltpetre is 
necessary to produce the fine red colour either in ham or 
beef; but much will make the meat hard, and the proportions 
of sugar and salt should be varied according to the preference 
given to highly-salted provisions, or those which are cured 
milder. 

TO CORN BEEF. 

459. — A Bound of Beef, of 18 or 20 Ihs. weight. — Mix 1^ 
oz. of sal-prunella, 3 oz. of brown sugar, ^ oz. of black pepper, 
6 oz. of bay-salt, i oz. of cloves pounded, the same of nut- 
meg, and i lb. of common salt : take out the bone, and rub 
the piece over with common salt ; let it remain for a day or 
two, and then rub into it tlie above ingredients finely pow- 
dered and thoroughly mixed ; let it lie a fortnight, and turn 
it daily. It should then be hung up in a dry place, and, if 
possible, smoked till wanted for use, vrhen it should be either 
boiled gently, or baked in a deep dish covered with coarse 
paste. 

This, it may however be observed, is rather a superior 
mode ; as the common way is merely to use bay-salt, with 
occasionally a little saltpetre to give a tinge of redness to the 
meat, which is seldom smoked except for very large joints. 
Many persons, indeed, think the meat best when stewed ; in 
which case, put no more water in the pot than will barely 
cover the meat, and keep it gently simmering for 4, 5, or 6 
hours, according to the size of the joint. 

To salt Beef red. — Choose a piece of beef with as little 
bone as you can (the flank is the best), sprinkle it, and let it 
drain a day ; then rub it with common salt, a small propor- 
tion of saltpetre, bay-salt, and a little coarse sugar ; you may 
add a fev/ grains of cochineal, all in fime powder. Rub the 
pickle every day into the meat for a week, then only turn it. 

It will be excellent in 8 days. In 16, drain it from tlif? 



342 MODEFtN" DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX. 

pickle ; and let it be smoked at the oven's mouth when heated 
vvith wood, or send it to the baker's. A few days will smoke 
it. It is extremely good eaten fresh from the pickle, boiled 
tender with greens or carrots. If to be grated, then cut a lean 
bit, boil it till extremely tender, and while hot put it under 
a press. When cold, fold it in a sheet of paper, and it will 
keep in a dry place 2 or 3 months, ready for serving on bread 
and butter. 

THE DUTCH WAY TO SALT BEEF. 

460. — Take a lean piece of beef, rub it well with treacle or 
brown sugar, and turn it often. In 3 days wipe it, and salt it 
vvitli common salt and saltpetre beaten fine ; rub these well 
in, and turn it every day for a fortnight. Eoll it tight in a 
coarse cloth, and press it under a heavy weight ; hang to dry 
in wood-smoke, but turn it upside down every day. Eoil it 
in pump-water, and press it : it will grate or cut into shivers, 
and makes a good breakfast dish. 

To 12 lbs. of beef the proportion of common salt is 1 lb. 

HAMBURG BEEF.—E. B. 

461. — Take a piece of ribs of beef of about 15 lbs. weight, 
and rub it well with common salt ; let it lie for a day or two. 
Take 2 oz. of sal-prunelhi, 4 oz. of bay-salt, 4 oz. of coarse 
brown sugar, ^ oz. of white pepper, and I oz. of cloves and 
mace ; mix and pound these all well together, and rub them 
well into the beef ; let it lie for a fortnight, taking care to 
turn it daily. When taken out of the pickle it should be 
sm.oked, either by lighted oak sawdust or in the chimney of a 
kitchen where wood is burned. 

Or: — To 16 lbs. of beef put 1 lb. of common salt, 1 lb. of 
treacle, 2 oz. of bay-salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre ; rub the salt 
thoroughly over the beef, and pour the treacle upon it. Let 
-t be turned every day, and well rubbed in the pickle. At 
the end of 3 weeks put it to dry in wood-smoke. The under 
bed is the best part for this purpose, but the ribs may also be 
used. 

SPICED BEEF.—E. R. 

462. — Make a brine with ^ lb. of salt, ^ oz. of saltpetre, 
\ lb. of sugar, 30 cloves, as many allspice and black pepper- 
corns, 6 bay-leaves ; crack the spice, put it on to boil for a 



CuAP. XX. CURINa MEAT. 343 

few minutes in a pint of water ; when cold, pour it over a 
piece of beef about 10 lbs. Turn it every day for a fort- 
night. 

When required for use, put tlie beef into a deep p'an with 
the brine, a little water, and about 1 lb. of suet. Bake it 
until tender ; let it get cold in the brine. 

Spiced Flank of Beef.— Take 8 or 10 lbs. of the thin flank, 
remove any skin, gristle, or bones ; rub it over with ^ cz. of 
saltpetre and ^ oz. of bay-salt ; then rub it well in wiih a 
mixture of spices, the following proportions being used : — 
1 oz. of black pepper, 1 oz. of allspice, h oz. of ground ginger, 
^ oz. of cloves, and half the quantity of mace. Use only as 
much as will suffice to rub the beef all over ; then add 3 oz. 
of common salt and i lb, of coan^e sugar ; let the beef remain 
a fortnight in this pickle, turning it and rubbing it every day : 
then take it out, cover it with the spices and chopped sweet 
herbs, roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put it into a pan with 
-J pint of water and ^ lb. of suafc, and bake it or boil it gently 
for 4 hours ; put a heavy vv^eight upon it, and when cold take 
off the tape. There will be a fine jelly at the bottom of the 
pan, which should be cleared from fat, and mixed with an 
equal portion of jelly from an ox-foot, as it will be too salt to 
eat alone, or it may be used in soups, 

Leicestershire Spiced Beef — Take a round of beef, rub in 
i lb. of saltpetre finely pounded ; let it stand a day, then 
season it with h lb. of bay-salt, 1 oz. of black pepper, the same 
of allspice, both pounded. Let it lie in the pickle a month, 
turning it every day, and adding about three times a-week a 
small quantity of common salt. Then wash off the salt and 
spice ; cut some fat bacon into pieces about i inch square, and 
long enough to penetrate the beef ; roil them in spices, ^ oz. 
of mace, 3 large nutmegs, a teaspoonful of cayenne, and the 
same of black pepper, pounded ; lard the beef with the bacon, 
and a green stuffing made of chopped herbs. Tie the beef 
round with tape, to preserve its shape. Put it into a pan deep 
enough to hold it ; lay a great quantity of beef-suet both 
under and over the beef; cover the pan first with brown 
paper, then v/ith paste made of barley-flour, and another paper 
on the top. Put it into a quick oven, and bake it 7 or 8 
hours. Pour off the fat and gravy, and let it be cold before 
it is cut. 



344 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX. 



WELSH BEEF.—E. R. 

463.— Eub 2 oz. of saltpetre into a round of beef, let it 
remain an hour, then season it with pepper, salt, and a fourth 
portion of allspice ; allow the beef to stand in the brine for 15 
days, turning it frequently. Work it well with pickle ; put 
it into an earthen vessel, with a quantity of beef-suet over and 
raider it, cover it with a coarse paste and bake it, allowing it 
to remain in the oven for 6 or 8 hours. Pour off the gravy, 
and let the beef sta^id till cold. It will keep for 2 months in 

winter. 

HUNTERS' BEEF.—E. R. 

464. — To a round of beef weighing 24 lbs. take 3 oz. of 
saltpetre, 3 oz. of the coarsest sugar, 1 oz. of cloves and nut- 
meg, ^ oz. of allspice, and 3 handfuls of common salt, all in 
the linest pov/der. Allow the beef to hang 2 or 3 days, 
remove the bones, then rub the spices well into it, continuing 
to do so every day for 2 or 3 weeks. V/hen to be dressed, 
dip it in cold vrater to -take off the loose spice. Bind it up 
tightly with tape, and put it into a pan with a teacupfal of 
water at the bottom ; cover the top of the meat with shred 
suet ; cover the pan Avith a coarse crust, and brown paper 
over it. Let it bake 5 hours, and when cold take off the 
paste and the tape. 

Some persons stuff the orifice from whicli the bone was 
taken with parsley finely chopped, putting sweet herbs also all 
round between the skin and the meat. 

HUNG BEEF (the Derrynane Receipt).— E. R. 

465.— Rub the beef vr ell with salt and saltpetre, in the pro 
portion of 2 oz. of saltpetre and 7 lbs. of salt to 50 lbs. of 
beef. Put the beef into a cask or tub, place a board over it, 
and weights upon that ; leave it so for about a fortnight, then 
take it out and hang it in the kitchen to dry, which will 
generally take about 3 weeks. Some persons leave it for a 
longer time in the tub, which they merely cover without the 
weight ; but the above is the better way. 

TO CURE TONGUES. 

4,QQ. — Neats' tongues cured with the whole root on loo'v 
much larger, but have not any other advantage. If the root 
is to be removed, cut it off near the gullet, but without taking 
away the fat that is under the tongue. The root must be 



Chap. XX. CURINQ MEAT. 345 

soaked in salt and water a night, and extremely well cleaned 
before it be diessed, when it is very good stewed with gravy ; 
or may be salted 2 days, and nsed for pea-soup. Having left 
the fat and a little of the kernel under the tongue, sprinkle 
it with salt and let it drain until next day. Then for each 
tongue mix a large spoonful of common salt, the same quantity 
of coarse sugar, half as much saltpetre, a teaspoonful of 
ground pepper, and 2 cloves of garlic or shalot chopped 
very fine ; rub it well in, and do so every day for a week ; 
then add another large spoonful of salt. If rubbed daily, a 
tongue will be ready in 10 days ; but if only tiii-ned in the 
pickle, it will not be too salt in 4 or 5 v/eeks, but should not 
be kept longer. When to be dried, write the date of the day 
on parchment, and tie it on. Smoke 3 days, or hang them in 
a dry place without smoking. When to be dressed, boil the 
tongue extremely tender ; allow 5 hours, and if done sooner 
it is easily kept hot. The longer it is kept after smoking, the 
higher will be the flavour ; but in the estimation of many 
persons, they are best dressed out of the pickle ; if dried it 
may require soaking 4 or 5 houi'S. 

Or : — Put the tongue into an earthen pan, rub into it a 
tablespoonful of saltpetre, a good handful of salt, and the 
same quantity of coarse brown sugar ; allow the tongue to 
remain in the pickle for 3 weeks, and rub it over every day. 
Then take it out and put it into the meat-screen before the 
fire for 2 or 3 days, till the pickle has entirely drained from 
it. Then sprinkle it over with bran, and hang it up in any 
part of the kitchem with the root-end uppermost ; sew salt 
tongues up in coarse linen. 

To cure SJieej)''s Tongues. — Let the tongues be well washed 
and cleaned, and lay them in spring water for ^ an hour. 
Take 1 lb. of salt, J lb. of treacle, and ^ oz. of saltpetre ; rub 
the tongues well with it, and put them into the pickle : a week 
or 10 days will be sufficient to cure them. 

FOR CURING HA3IS. 

467. — Choose the leg of a hog that is fat and well fed, as 
well as of a certain age ; for, if poor, it is not worth curing, 
and if not 1 year old it v/ill never acquire the fine flavour of 
a mellow ham. Sprinkle it with a little salt, and let it drain 
for a day ; then put to it 1 lb. each of bay-salt and the 
coarsest sugar, with a large handfid. of common salt and 4 oz. 

o H 



346 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX. 

of saltpetre ; rub it tliorouglily with this ; lay the rind down- 
wards, and cover the fleshy parts with the salt, with which 
baste it frequently, and turn it every second day. Keep it 
in this for 4 weeks, then drain it and throw bran over it ; 
hang it up in a cool place to dry, then sew it up in a coarse 
linen ^vi^apj)er rubbed with lime, and do not di^ess it until 
full o months old. 

The better way is, however, to smoke it, for which there are 
in London and most large to^vns regular smoke-houses. In 
country places this is not uncommonly done by hanging it in 
a kitchen chimney where wood is burnt, or in any spare 
chimney where a smothering fire can be kept up, made of 
wet straw and horse litter, with sawdust or shavings : but bo 
particular to have them of oak, for, if oipine, it will give the 
ham a bad flavour. It will take 3 weeks' smoking. 

Or : — Hang the ham, and sprinkle it with salt as above ; 
then rub it every day with the following, in fine powder : 2 lb, 
of common salt, the same quantity of bay-salt, 2 oz, of salt- 
petre, and 2 oz. of black pepper, mixed with 1^ lb. of treacle. 

Another tvaij, that gives a higher flavour : — When the 
weather will permit, hang the ham 3 days ; mix 1 oz. of salt- 
petre with i lb. of bay-salt, the same quantity of common 
salt and also of coarse sugar, and a quart of strong beer ; 
boil them together, and pour them immediately upon the 
ham ; turn it twice a-day in the pickle for three weeks. 1 oz. 
of black pepper, and the same quantity of allspice, in fine 
powder, added to the above, will give still more flavour. 

Or : — Sprinkle the ham with salt, after it has himg 2 or 
3 days ; let it drain ; make a pickle of a quart of strong 
beer, ^ lb. of treacle, 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 2 oz. of 
juniper-berries, 1 oz. of pepper, the same quantity of allspice, 
1 oz. of saltpetre, i oz. of sal-prunella, a handful of common 
salt, and a head of shalot, all pounded or cut fine. Boil 
these all together a few minutes, and pour them over the 
ham ; this quantity is for one of 10 lb&. 

FITZSIMON FAMIL YRECEIPTFOR CURING HAMS.—E.R. 

4()8. — Mix 1 oz. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of common salt, and 1 lb. 
of coarse brown sugar all together, and rub the ham well. 
Let it lie for a month in this pickle, turning and basting if 
every day; then hang it in wood-smoke in a dry place, where 
no heat can come to it, and, if to be kept long, hang it for a 



Chap. XX. CUPJNG MEAT. 347 

month or two in a damp place, and it will eat firm and short. 
Observe, hams thus made need not be soaked ; put them into 
cold water, and let them be 3 or 4 hours before they boil, 
skimming the pot well and often mitil it boils. These hams 
luive been made with a less quantity of salt and an additional 
quantity of saltpetre, and it has been found to answer well, the 
hams being in that case soaked before boiling. 

WESTPHALIA HAMS.~E. R. 

469. — Prepare the hams in the usual manner by rubbing 
them with common salt and draining them ; take 1 oz. of salt- 
petre, ^ lb. of coarse sugar, and the same quantity of salt ; 
rub it well into the ham, and in 3 days pcur a pint of vinegar 
over it. A fine foreign flavour may also be given to hams by 
pouring old strong ])eer over them, and burning juniper-wood 
while they are drying : molasses, juniper-berries, and highly- 
iiavoured herbs, such as basil, sage, bay-leaves, and thyme, 
mingled together, and the liams well rubbed with it, using 
only a sufficient quantity of salt to assist in the cure, will 
afford an agreeable variety. 

MUTTON IIA3L-E. li. 

470. — Cut a hind quarter of mutton in the shape of a ham, 
and allow it to hang for 2 or 3 days. Mix ^ lb. of bay-salt, 
2 oz. of saltjiCtre, ^ lb. of common salt, and t lb. of coarse 
sugar, all well pounded together, and make them quite hot 
before the fire. Then rub it well into the meat, turning it in 
the liquor every day ; after 4 days add 2 oz. more of common 
salt. Let it remain 12 days in the brine, then take it out, dry 
it, and hang it up in wood-smoke for a week. 

Another pickle for mutton-ham may be made with 1 oz. of 
saltpetre to 1 lb. of coarse sugar and 1 lb. of salt ; the ham 
to be kept in this pickle for a fortnight, then rolled in sawdust, 
and hung in wood-smoke for 14 days. 

GOOSE HA3IS 

471. — Are made by splitting the goose down tlie bacr:. 
rubbing it with i oz. of saltpetre, and then salting it well 
■v\ iih common salt and coarse brown sugar ; let it lie in pickle 
for 10 days in summer and 14 in winter, rub and turn it every 
day, roll it in sawdust and smoke it. 

In Pomerania, on the shores of the Baltic, where vast 



348 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEIIY. Chap. XX. 

n-arii])ers are cin-ed, the breasts are prepared separately as 
hams ; and being much dried in smoking, are always eaten 
without further dressing. In the fens of Lincolnshire the 
geese, when their feathers have been plucked, are also salted. 

BACON. 

472. — Tlie metliod of curing Malines Bacon, so much 
admired for its fine flavour. — Cut off the hams and head of a 
pig, if a large one ; take out the chine and leave in the spare- 
rib, as they v>^ill keep in the gravy and prevent the bacon from 
rusting. Salt it first with common salt, and let it lie for a day 
on a table that the blood may run from it ; then make a brine 
with a pint of bay-salt, i peck of common salt, about \ lb. of 
juniper-berries, and some bay-leaves, Tvdth as much water as 
will, when the brine is made, cover, the bacon ; when the salt 
is dissolved, and when quite cold, if a new-laid egg will swim 
in it, the brine may be put on the bacon, v>"hich after a week 
must be rubbed with the following mixture : — ^ lb. of saltpetre, 
2 oz. of sal-primolla, and 1 lb. of coarse sugar ; after remaining 
4 weeks it may be hung up in a phimney where wood is 
biu'ned ; shavings, with sawdust and a small quantity of turf, 
may be added to the fire at times. 

The BlacJc Pool receipt for curing Bacon. — For a mid- 
tlling-sized hog take 12 lbs. of the best common salt, and 1 lb. 
of sa,l};petre pounded very finely ; rub it in well, and cover the 
meat about an inch thick, hams, chojis, and all, placing it 
vdth the rind downwards. Let it remain for a week ; then 
take off the salt, turn the whole with the rind upwards, then 
lay the salt on again for another week. Then remove the 
salt, and turn it a second time ; lay on the salt and let it 
remain 4 days longer. It will then be properly salted. Wipe 
it clean, rub it all over vith diy salt, and hang it, where it 
will have a little air of the fire, imtil it is dry. Then sew it 
up in whity-brovvn paper, and hang it in a dry place where no 
heat cam come to it ; and if these precautions are taken, it 
v,ill not get rusty. 

The meat must be salted on a board that is well perforated 
with holes to let the brine run from it, and it must be covered 
up closely with a coarse cloth to keep out the air ; and while 
salting take care to lay the pieces as close as possible one 
v.pon the other. 



Chap. XX. CUEING MEAT. 349 

WILTSHIRE BAG OX. 

473. — Sprinkle each flitcliAvith salt, and let the blood drain 
off for 24 hours. Then mix H lb. of coarse sugar, the same 
quantity of bay-salt, 6 oz. of saltpetre, and 4 lbs. of coarse salt ; 
rub this well on the bacon, turning and wetting it in every 
part, daily, for a month ; then hang it to dry, and afterwards 
smoke it 10 days. 

The above quantity of salt is sufficient for a whole hog of 
about 7 or 8 score. 

To cure JBuconfor larding and braising. — Take the fattest 
part of the pork, and to every 10 lbs. use 1 lb. of pounded 
salt ; rub it very well over, put the pieces one upon another 
upon boards, and lay boards with a heavy vv^eight upon the 
top ; leave it in a dry cool place for about a month, then hang 
it up to dry without smoking. The hardest is the best for 
larding ; and bacon cured'in this vray is preferable for culinary 
purposes, since the saltpetre usually employed will turn veal 
or poultry red, when braised with any portion of the lean. 

HOG'S CHEEKS. 
474. — Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split the 
liead, taking off the upper bone, to make the chowl a good 
shape ; rub it well with salt ; next day take away the brine, 
and salt it again the following day with a quart of bay-salt, 
2 quarts of common salt, and H lb. of brown sugar, put into 
1 i gallon of spring water ; stir it until the whole is dissolved. 
This quantity will be sufficient for 3 pairs of chaps : be careful 
to turn them in the brine at least every other day, and to keep 
them well covered. Dry them in vrood-ashes. 

BRA wjsr. 

475. — Split and nicely clean a hog's head, take out the 
brains, cut off the ears, and rub a good deal of salt into the 
head ; let it drain 24 hours ; then lay upon it 2 oz. of salt- 
petre, and the same of common salt, for 3 days ; lay the head 
and salt into a pan, with just water to cover it, for 2 days more. 

Wash it well, and boil until the bones will come out ; re- 
move them, and chop the meat as quickly as possible in pieces 
of 1 inch long ; but first take the skin carefully off the head 
and the tongue, the latter also cut in bits. Season with pepper 
and salt. Put the skin of one side of the head into a small 
long pan, press the chopped head and tong ae into it, and lay 



3oO MODEIIN DOMESTIC COOKERY. CiiAr. XX. 

tlie skin of the other side of the head over, and press it down. 
When cold it will turn out. The head may probably be too 
fat, in which case prepare a few bits of lean pork with the 
head. Boil 2 oz. of salt, a pint of vinegar, and a quart of the 
liquor, and, when cold, pour it over the head. The ears are 
to be boiled longer than the head, cut in thin strips, and 
divided about it, the hair being nicely removed. Reboil tht 
pickle often. 

Another mock ]3rmvn. — Boil a pair of neat's feet ver\ 
tender ; take the meat off, and have ready the belly-piece oi 
pork, salted with common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boil 
this till nearly done ; take out the bones, and roll the feet and 
the pork together. Then roll it very tight with a strong 
cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender, then hang it up 
in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in a sousing liquor. 

To keep Braitm, the Cambridge icay. — To 2 gallons of 

(\'ater put 1 lb. of wheat-bran and 1 lb. of salt ; boil 1 hour ; 

when cold, strain it, and keep the brav/n in it. In 10 or 12 

days fresh pickle will be required. If, by length of carriage 

or neglect, the brawn be kept too lon^ out of pickle, make 

as above, and vvhen rubbed well with salt, and washed with 

some of the pickle, it will be quite restored to its former 

goodness. 

TO PICKLE PORK.~E. R. 

476. — Take ^ bushel of common salt, 1 lb. of bay-salt, h lb. 
of saltpetre, and 6 lbs. of coarse brown sugar ; make hams of 
the legs. Take the sides of the })ork and rub them well with 
common salt, lay a thin bed of salt in the tray, and place one 
of the sides in it ; sprinkle with salt to cover it : lay the other 
side on the top, and sprinkle it also. Let them lie 2 or 3 
days, rubbing the salt well in ; then cover the whole with the 
other ingredients, and, as soon as the salt begins to give, rub 
them well in ; turn the sides frequently, and let them be 
covered with brine : it will be fit for use in 6 or 8 weeks. 
These quantities are for a pig of 15 or 16 score. 

A PICKLE 

477. — T)iat will keep for years, for hatns, tongues, or beef 
if boiled and skimmed between each parcel of them. — To 2 
gallons of spring water put 2 lbs. of coarse sugar, 2 lbs. of bay

earthen glazed pan that Avill hold 4 gallons, and with a cover 
that will fit close. Keep the beef or hams as long as they 
will bear before you put them into the pickle ; and sprinkle 
them with coarse sugar in a pan, from which they must drain. 
Ivub the hams, &c., well with the pickle, and pack them in 
close, putting as much as the pan will hold, so that the pickle 
may cover them. The pickle is not to be boiled at first. A 
small ham may lie 14 days, a large one 3 weeks ; a tongue 12 
days, and beef in proportion to its size. They will eat well 
out of the pickle without drying. When they are to be dried, 
let each piece be drained over the pan ; and when it will drop 
no longer, take a clean sponge and dry it thoroughly. 6 or 
S hours will smoke them, and there should be only a little 
sawdust and wet straw burnt to do this ; but if put into a 
baker's chimney, sew them in a coarse cloth, and hang them a 
week. Add 2 lbs. of common salt and 2 pints of water every 
lime you boil the liquor. 



POTTING AND COLLAPJNG. 

478. — To pot and collar are only different modes of pre- 
serving fish and meat for a longer time than they could be 
kept fresh ; chiefly, in the instance of potting, by pounding 
the materials with seasoning, when dressed, and tlien putting 
small portions in closely covered jars or pots ; while collarim) 
is done by slicing portions of the meat or fish, and, when well 
seasoned, rolling it in round pieces, to be eaten cold as savoury 
dishes at breakfast and luncheon. 

In potting, take care to wait until the meat is cold ; press 
the meat firmly into the pots ; but, before putting it there, 
drain the gravy thoroughly from the meat, or the gravy will 
turn it sour ; then cover well with clarified butter, and. tie 
over it oil-skin, or oiled paper, to exclude the air. 

To clarify Butter. — Put the butter into a sauce-boat, which 
place in a saucepan of cold water, and set it over a slow fire 
until it melts ; then take it off the fire, take off the scum, and 
again warm it gently. After being used it will still serve for 
basting or for meat-pie paste, and is also excellent for fi.sli 
sauce. 

In collaring^ be careful to roll the meat tightly and bind it 



352 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKEr.Y. c^ap. XZv. 

firmly. Let it also be thoroughly done, left in a cool place, 
sometimes rubbed with pickle, but always wiped perfectly dry. i 

TO FOT LA3IPRE Y. 

479. — Lamprey is a species of eel only found in a few parts ' 
of England ; and, being considered as a rarity, is almost in- 
variably potted for the convenience of being forwarded to 
places at a distance. The mode adopted at ^Worcester, which 
is celebrated for its superior excellence, is as follows : — Leave ; 
the skin on. but remove the cartilajre and a string on each side \ 
of it down the back. Wash and clean the fish very nicely in j 
several waters, and wipe them. To 12 of a tolerable size use j 
2 oz. of white pepper, salt in proportion, 6 blades of mace, a j 
dozen of cloves, all in fine powder, but do not season until the I 
fish shall have drained all night. Lay them in a stone pot one 
by one, and curled round, the spices and salt being sprinkled \ 
in and about them. Clarify 2 lbs. of butter and ^ lb. of the I 
finest beef-suet, pour it on the fish, and lay thick paper over \ 
to keep in the steam. Bake 3 hours in a moderate oven. , 
Look often at them, and as the oil works up take it clear oft. 
They will thus, in the storepot, keep till the spring. Put into 
pots for serving as wanted ; observing to take off the old 1 
butter, and, having warmed the fish in the oven, cover with { 
fresh butter only. ; 

TO POT SHELL-FISH. i 

480. — ^Loil lobsters, crayfish, and shrimps in salt and water, , 
pick the meat out of the tails and claws, put them into a stev.- 

pan with a little butter, some chopped mushrooms or truffles, ; 

and simmer a sliort time over a gentle fire. When nearly I 

done, beat the yolks of 2 or 3 eggs with a teacupftd of cream i 

and a little chopped parsley ; let all stew together for a few : 
minutes, until rendered as consistent as paste, and set it as 

above stated. i 

Or: — When boiled, take them out of their shells, and \ 

season them with salt, white pepper, and a very little mace '• 

and nutmeg ; but use the spice very sparingly, only just suffi- I 

cient to preserve the fish for a few days in a fresh state, as \ 

they will not keep good much longer. Press them into a pot, '•. 

lay a little butter pver them, and bake in a slow oven for 10 j 

minutes. Yv^hen cold, cover with clarified butter. \ 

Shrimps may also be potted tchole, by putting them for a

few minutes into clarified butter, seasoned as above, and gently 
heated ; then put into pots, and cover with more butter, to 
totally prevent the admission of air. Cover the pots also with 
oil-skin. 

TO POT POULTRY AND GAME. 

481. — Chicke)is. — Take as much lean of boiled ham as you 
may tliink proper, and -^ the quantity of fat, each cut as thin 
as possible ; beat it very fine in a mortar with a little clarified 
butter, pounded mace, pepper, and salt — if the ham be not 
sufficiently impregnated. To this add the wliite part of the 
fowl, also pounded, but v/ithout seasoning, as it is only in- 
tended to qualify the savouriness of the ham. Then either 
mix the whole together, or put a layer of ham and chicken 
alternately ; press it hard in the pots, bake in a cool oven for 
^ an hour, pour over it clarified butter to the thickness of a 
crown-piece, and paste over it a piece of paper, which may be 
oiled when the paste is dry. 

Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and season 
them with salt and pepper ; lay them close in a small deep 
pan ; for, the smaller the surface, and the closer they are 
packed, the less butter will be wanted. Cover them with 
butter, then with very thick paper, tie down and bake them. 
When cold, put them dry into pots that will hold 2 or 3 in 
each ; and pour butter over them, using that wliicli was baked 
as part. Observe that the butter should be pretty thick over 
them if they are to be kept. If pigeons were boned and then 
put in an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer and 
require less butter. They may be stuffed with a fine force- 
meat made with veal, bacon, &c. If a high flaA'our is ap- 
proved of, add mace, allspice, and a little cayenne, before 
baking. 

Partridges and Pheasants. — Clean them nicely, and sea- 
son with mace, allspice, white pepper, and salt, in fine powder, 
or seasoning spice. Rub every part well ; then lay the breast 
downwards in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you pos- 
sibly can. Put a good deal of butter on them ; then cover the 
pan with a coarse flour paste, and a paper over, tie it close^ 
and bake. When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them 
vrith butter. 

Or :— TvTien baked and grown cold, cut them into proper 
pieces for helping ; pack them close into a large potting-pai^. 



354 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX. 

mid (if possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover 
them with butter, and I part less will be wanted than when 
the birds are done whole. 

Hare. — Hang up a hare 4 or 5 days with the skin on ; then 
case it, and cut it up as for eating ; put it in a pot, and season 
it with mace, pepper, and salt ; put 1 lb. of butter upon it, tie 
it down, and bake it in a bread-oven till tender. When it 
comes out, pick it from the bones, and pound to a smooth 
consistency with the fat from the butter, and pot it in the usual 
way." 

Rahhits. — Cut up 2 or 3 young 1)ut full-grown ones, and 
take the leg-bones off at the thigh ; pack them as closely as 
possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with pepper, 
mace, cayenne, salt, allspice, all in very fine pov/der. Slake 
the top as smooth as you can. Keep out the liver and the 
carcases, but take off the meat above the neck. Put a good 
deal of butter, and bake the whole gently. Keep it 2 days in 
tlie pan ; then shift it into small pots, adding butter. The 
livers also should be added, as they eat well. 

Ham and veal may be potted in the same manner. 

Neat^s Tongue. — Rub it with 1 oz. of saltpetre and 4 oz. of 
brown sugar ; let it lie 2 days, then boil it until it is quite 
tender ; take off the skin and all the fibrous part of the root, 
cut it in thin pieces, and pound it with 1 lb. of clarified butter, 
and seasoning to your taste.'' 

TO POT BEEF. 

482. — Take 4 lbs. of the brisket, round, or rump of beef, 
free from skin or sinews of any kind. Rub it over with rather 
more than \ oz. of sugar, common salt, and saltpetre, and 
leave it in that state for a couple of days, turning it over 3 or 
4 times ; then put it into a stewpan placed in an oven, with a 
little chopped suet and about \ pint of water. When suffi- 
ciently stewed, drain the fat and gravy from the meat, cut it 
np, and pound it in a mortar till it becomes perfectly smooth, 
adding to it some cayenne, white })epper, salt, and a little 
pounded mace, with about \ lb. of clarified butter, to be gra- 
dually mixed with the meat while pounding. When reduced

Chap. XX. POTTING AXD COLLARIXG. '655 

to this consistence, put it into pots, bake it, and cover it in the 
same manner as in other receipts. 

Or: — Put the same quantity of beef, prepared in like 
manner, into an earthen pot with a few bhades of bruised 
mace, a marrow-bone, and a pint of water. Let the pot 
remain for the space of 3^ hours in a hot oven, after which 
the beef and marrow should be pounded and reduced to a 
pulp, along with ^ lb. of anchovies which have been scaled 
and boned. 

Season as before, and pot in the same manner ; the marrow 
and anchovy not only adding to the flavour of the meat, but 
tending to keep it longer in a moist state."" 

To pot Beef in imitation of Venison. — Put 8 or 10 lbs. ot 
lean beef into a deep dish ; pour over it a pint of red wine, 
and let it lie in it for 2 days, seasoning it well with mace, 
pepper, salt, and a clove of garlic ; then put it into a closely 
covered pot along witli the wine, and another glassful if it be 
not sufficient, and bake it for 3 hours in a quick oven ; when 
cold, pound it to a paste, and pot it as above. 

Veniso7i may itself be potted in the same manner ; but if it 
be stale, rub it previously with pyroligneous acid. 

HA3I CAKE.—E. R. 

483. — Take the remains of a ham that may be getting dry, 
pound it in a mortar very finely, with all the fat ; season it 
with pepper and mixed spice ; add to it clarified butter suffi- 
cient to make it moist ; put it into a mould, and place it in an 
oven for about ^ an hour ; it should be prepared the day before 
it is wanted : put the mould for a few minutes in warm water 
in order that it may turn out properly. This may be made 
with equal quantities of cold beef pounded separately, and 
placed in layers in the mould, or put together in lumps to look 
like marble. Tongue may also be substituted for the ham, but 
it must be mixed with a larger quantity of butter in the 
pounding. If not wanted at the time, it may be potted with 
veal, and covered v/ith clarified butter. It will keep well in 
winter if properly seasoned. 

TO POT 3IUSHR O 03IS.

not yet the least brown ; peel and wipe out the fur of the 
larger ones ; and to every 2 quarts put i dr. of pounded mace, 
2 drs. of white pepper, and 6 or 8 cloves in powder : set them 
over the fire, shake, and let the liquor dry up into them. Then 
put to them 2 oz. of butter, and stew them in it till they are 
fit for eating ; pour the butter from them, and let them become 
cold. Pack them close into a pot, making the surface as even 
as possible ; add some butter lukewarm, and then lay a bit of 
white paper over them, and pour clarified suet upon it to 
exclude the air. 

The collaring of Meat and Fish is an excellent method of 
preparing it to be eaten cold, having the advantage of keepii g 
for a l.ong time, and being at all times ready for breakfast or 

luncheon. 

COLLARED EEL.—E. R. 

485. — Cut off the head, then split and take out the bone, 
but do not skin the fish ; season them with mixed spices, some 
parsley and sweet marjoram shred very fine, and a few chopped 
sage-leaves ; sprinkle a little dry isinglass over them ; roll 
them tightly up in a cloth, bind it well vfith strong tape. 
Eoil them in good gravy with a little vinegar, according to the 
quantity of eels collared, a few pepper-corns, a sprig of sweet 
marjoram, 2 or 3 onions, 4 bay-leaves, a blade or two of mace, 
and a dozen allspice. Boil until tender ; take them up and 
retie them without removing the cloth, let them stand until 
cold, then glaze them. They may be sent whole to table, or 
cut in slices, and garnished with jelly and barberries. 

The jelly should be made of the liquor the eels are stewed 
in, adding a little isinglass if necessary and seasoning to 
palate. Use a white of an egg beaten up to clarify it. 

As a standing dish, and only eaten cold as a relish, it ought 
always to be highly seasoned. 

TO " CAVEACIV FISH. 

486. — Bone the tail of a cod, and cut it into slices, season 
them with white pepper and salt, then fry them, and when cold 
put them into a pickle made of vinegar boiled with pepper- 
corns, a few cloves, mace, and bay-leaves ; add when cold a 
teacupful of salad oil ; lay the fish in a jar vnth slices of onion 
between each, and cover the whole with vinegar. Salmon 
may be pickled in the same manner. When sent to table put 
a sufficient number of pieces in the centre of a dish, and raise 
round it a wall of salad. 



CH..r. XX. POTTIXG AND COLLARING-. 357 



TO COLLAR BEEF. 

487. — Malie a pickle with 6 oz. of brown sugar, 4 oz. of 
common salt, and 1 oz. of saltpetre. Then take a flank of 
beef, and leave it in the pickle for 10 days or a fortnight, 
turning it every day. When taken out, remove the bone and 
gristle, but leave on the outer skin : lay it upon the table, 
v,dth the skin downwards, and beat the inside well with a roll- 
ing-pin or wooden mallet until quite tender ; that done, score 
the flesh in roAvs, down and across, about the breadth of 2 
fingers : but in doing so take care not to cut the outside skin. 
Then All the scores alternately v.dth slices of the fat of bacon 
and corned pork, and sweet herbs of all sorts, chopped, and 
seasoned with spice, till you have filled them all ; after which, 
roll the flank up very tightly, and bind it round with coarse 
broad tape, wrap it in a cloth, and boil it gently, but steadily, 
for 4 or o hours, according to the size of the joint. When 
quite cold, take it out of the cloth, unbind the tape, and 
iasten the roll with small skewers. If you wish to improve 
its appearance, you may also either glaze it, or rub it with 
yolk of egg, and brown it with a salamander. 

Another mode is, to take either the Jlanli or brisket, and 
prepare it, as above, for boiling ; but stew it with a very little 
water, and, when done, cover the meat with a coating of chop- 
ped parsley, thyme, chives, or shalot, seasoned with a little 
cayenne ; then put it under a board, and lay weights upon it 
for an hour or two, to press it close together ; but before it 
becomes quite cold, remove the weights, and roll the piece up 
in the manner already directed. 

An economical way. — Take the best part of « shi7i of beef, 
of which soup has been made (for it must be stewed until very 
tender), and an ox-tail, also well stewed ; cut them into small 
pieces, season them well, add a glass of wine and a glass of 
ketchup, and put it into a stewpan covered with a part of the 
liquor in vrhich the ox-tail has been boiled ; stew it for aboul 
20 minutes, and then put it into a mould. It must be very 
cold before it is turned out. This is a good way of employing 
the beef and heel when soup or jelly is made ; a few chopped 
sweet herbs may be added, and hard eggs cut into slices, oi 
pickles, such as sliced cucumbers, intermingled. The flavour 
may be varied in man^^ ways. 



358 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XX. 

TO COLLAR CALF'S HEAD. 

488. — Scald the skin of a fine head, clean it nicely, and take 
out the brains. Boil it tender enough to remove the bones ; 
then have ready a good quantity of chopped parsley, mace, 
groim.d nutmeg, salt, and vrhite pepper, mixed Tvell : stason it 
Iiigh T\ith these : lay the pai'sley in a thick layer, then a 
quantity of thick slices of fine ham, or a beautifully coloured 
tongue skinned, and then the yolks of 6 eggs stuck here and 
there about. Eoll the head quite close, and tie it up as tight 
as you can. Boil it till the tape slackens, and then lay a 
weight upon it (vrithout removing the bandage) till quite 
cold. Keep it in a pickle of the liquor, vinegar, and salt. 

A cloth must be put under the tape, as for other collars. 

Ox-cheek m.ay be collared in the same vray. 

BREAST OF VEAL. 

489. — Bone it, take off the thick skin and giistle, and beat 
the meat Tvith a rolling-pin. Season it -with herbs chopped 
very fine, mixed with salt, pepper, and mace. Lay some 
thick slices of fine ham ; or roll into it 2 or 3 calves' tongues 
of a fine red, boiled fiist an hour or two, and skinned. Bind 
it up tight in a cloth, and tape it. Set it over a slow fire to 
simmer in a small quantity of water, till it is quite tender : 
this will take some hours. Lay it on the dresser, vvith a 
board and weight on it, till quite cold. 

Pigs' and calves' feet boiled, and taken from the bones, may 
be put in or round it. The different colours laid in layers 
look well when cut ; and you may put in yolks of eggs boiled, 
beet-ioot, grated ham, and chopped parsley, in different parts. 

T\'hen it is cold, take off the tape, and pour over it the liquor, 
which must be boiled up tv*ice a vreek, or it \\i\l not keep. 

BREAST OF MUTT02^, 

490. — Collared in this mode, will also be found very nice. 
Bone the meat, and rub it over with yolk of ^^^^ over which 
grate some lemon-peel and nutmeg, with a little pepper and 
salt ; then mince a large spoonful of capers with a couple of 
anchovies, shred a handful of parsley and a few sweet herbs, 
mixed with crumb of a French roll ; sti-ew it over the mutton, 
and roll it up tight ; boil it gently for 2 hours, and, when taken 
up, put it in the same kind of pickle as that for calf's head.

TO COLLAR A PIG.~E. 22. 

491. — Take a fine fat pig of a montli or 5 weeks old, pre- 
pared for tlio table ; cut off the head and split the pig down the 
back, and bone it ; chop a handnil of sage very small, mix it 
mth 2 nutmegs and 3 or 4 blades of mace beaten fine ; add. 
to it a large handful of salt, and season the pig all over ; roll 
it hard, tie it with tape, sew it in a clean linen cloth, and boil 
it in water vdth a little oatmeal and a good seasoning of salt ; 
boil till very tender, which will take several houi'S. Keep it 
in the cloth in which it was boiled until quite cold. Then 
take the cloth from the pig, and let it lie for 8 days in a ma- 
rinade. Eat it ^vith mustard, sugar, and ^^negar. 

To collar Plg'^s Head. — Scour the head and ears nicely:, 
take off the hail' and snout, and take out the eyes and the 
brains ; lay it in water 1 night : then drain, salt it exti'emely 
well with common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie 5 days. Boil 
it enough to take out the bones ; then lay it on a dresser, tum- 
ing the thick end of one side of the head towards the thin end 
of the other, to make the roll of equal size ; sprinkle it well 
"svith salt and white pepper, and roll it with the ears ; and, if 
you approve, put the pig's feet round the outside when boned . 
or the thin parts of 2 cow heels. Put it into a cloth, bind with 
a broad tape, and boil it till quite tender ; then put a good 
weight upon it, and do not take off the covering till cold. 

If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, let 
the propoiiion of saltpetre be gi-eater, and put in also somo 
pieces of lean pork ; and then cover it with cow-heel to look 
like the horn. 

This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt and 
water boiled, vdth vinegar ; and is a verj' convenient thing 
to have in the house. 

If likely to spoil, slice and fry it either with or without 
butter. 

Take four pigs' feet, two ears, and the tongiie, all pickled ; 
boil them until thoroughly tender ; then bone the feet, skin 
the tongue, and cut both it and the ears into pieces ; have a 
mould with a drainer at the bottom, put in a layer of the feet, 
then some ear and tongue ; season with pepper, pounded all- 
spice, mace, and a little salt ; and again feet, until it is all 
used up : put a heav}' weight, and leave it until cold : turn 
it out, and cut in slices as you vrould brawn.

CHAPTER XXI. 

ITALIAN PASTES, RICE, EGGS, OMELETTES, CHEESE, 
PANCAKES, AND FRITTERS. 

ITALIAN PASTES. 

493.: — Macaroni is coming mucli more into use in this 
country than formerly, and large quantities of it are now made 
in London. The Italian is, however, of a superior quality, as 
the flour of which it is made comes from a peculiar species of 
wheat, only grown in some parts of Italy, and much harder than 
tlie grain raised in England ; the consequence of which is, that 
the English macaroni when boiled acquires a floury taste, while 
the Italian, though quite as tender, is more crisp and firm on 
the palate, as well as more transparent in appearance, and 
should be always preferred, not only from what we have 
already said, but from the better mode in which it is there 
manufactured. The Genoese and Neapolitan are thought the 
best, but there are different opinions on the subject of their 
value ; the Neapolitan being only l5., while the Genoese is 
1*. Ad. per lb. The Genoese, being closer made than that of 
Naples, and appearing to be more delicate, bears the higher 
price ; but the Neapolitan being more easily dressed, cooks 
generally prefer it, though not so essentially good as the 
former. 

Besides macaroni, there are vermicelli, se?7ioli?ta, a smaller 
sort called macaroncini, and various other pastes of the same 
nature, all made in Italy from the same kind of grain ; nothing, 
therefore, can be more simply nutritive, nor, when well boiled. 



Jhap. XXI. ITALIAN PASTES. oGl 

more easy of digestion. There are also two sorts of macaroni 
— tlie pipe and the tape — :the one hollow, and the other flat, 
but both made of the same material ; vermicelli is most gene- 
rally used in soup. 

3IACAR0NI. 

494. — Cooks are, in this country, very fond of boiling it in 
milk, and even of laying it in milk for an hour or two to swell 
and become tender, but boiling water is better, i lb. will 
be sufficient for half a dozen people, and will not require 
more than 20 to 26 minutes to become tender if boiled in 
v/ater, but a few minutes longer if boiled in broth. Half the 
quantity of Parmesan cheese should be finely grated and 
sprinkled over it in layers, to mix it thoroughly ; a small 
plateful of grated macaroni is also put on the table for each 
person to add it at their pleasure. It should be served quite 
hot, as the least chill soddens it. In England it is usually 
eaten with mustard, and, if wished to be made very savoury, 
beef gravy may be used with a truffle stewed in it. 

As to using any other cheese with it than Parmesan, or 
l)erhaps Gruyere, or both, it is decidedly objectionable ; we 
have tried it repeatedly with Cheshire and other English and 
Dutch sorts, but nothing but Parmesan will give it the true 
flavour. The best substitute is the white Derby. 

To brown Macaroni is the common practice of our English 
cooks ; though, in fact, the browning, while giving a pretty 
appearance to the macaroni, not only hardens the top of the 
cheese into a crust, but gives a taste of rancidity, and we 
strongly recommend the old way of merely stewing, and put- 
ting it on the table just as it comes from the stewpan. If, 
however, appearance be preferred to flavour, it can be done 
with crumbs of bread, thus : — 

"Wash the macaroni, then simmer it in a little broth, with a 
little pounded mace and salt. When quite tender, take it out 
of the liquor, lay it in a dish, grate a good deal of cheese over, 
then cover that with bread grated fine. Warm some butter 
without oiling, and pour it from a boat through a little earthen 
colander all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch 
oven to brown the bread of a fine colour. 

NEAPOLITAN MACARONI. 

495. — Boil it quickly in water with some salt ; when tender 
strain it off, drain it thoroughly, and put it into a stewpan 



362 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX1> 

with a few bits of butter, and grated Parmesan cheese, pepper, 
and salt. Toss it until the cheese is well mixed, and then put 
it into a dish, with the remainder, the larger portion, of the 
grated cheese on the top. It is not to be browned, and will 
be found delicious. 

Or : — When boiled put a layer at the bottom of the dish, 
seasoned with black pepper and salt, then a layer of Parmesan 
cheese. ]Make 2 or 3 layers, finish mtli the cheese on the top, 
then pour round a rich brown gravy. 

Or: — Boil the macaroni in weak veal-broth until it is 
soft, adding salt for seasoning. When tender drain it, and put 
it on a dish, placing small bits of butter and grated cheese upon 
every layer. Put a larger quantity of grated cheese and 
butter on the top, and place the dish in a Dutch oven for i 
hour, but do not allow the cheese to become hard. 

COLD MACARONI, 

496. — If already dressed, may be warmed in any kind of 
broth, letting it simmer gently upon a slow fire with the yolks 
of 2 eggs to thicken ; after which it should be put into the 
oven in a mould covered with crumbs of bread : or, if un- 
dressed, it may be made by leaving it overnight in broth, and 
then proceeding with it as above. 

3IACAR ONI A U VI N. 

497. — Take a French roll hot out of the oven, rasp it, pour 
a pint of wine upon it, and cover it close up for ^ an hour to 
let it imbibe the wine ; then have ready an ounce of macaroni, 
boiled until it is soft, and lay it upon a sieve to drain : put 
into it butter about the size of a walnut, and as much thick 
cream as it will take. That done, scrape in as much Parmesan 
tossed into a pan with the macaroni until it becomes like a 
fine custard, and pour it hot upon the loaf : brown it with the 
salamander. 

MACARONI A VITALIENNE. 

498. — Take \ lb. of macaroni, boil it in water till tender; 
tliicken \ pint of milk with flour and a small bit of buti er ; add 
2 tablespocnfuls of cream, \ teaspoonful of mustard, a little 
white pepper, salt, and cayenne. Stir into tliis h lb. of grated 
cheese ; boil all together a few minutes ; add the macaroni ; 
make all quite hot, and serve. This is the mode adopted at 
the best tables in Florence. 



Chap. XXT. ITALIAN TASTES. 8G3 

TUIBALE DE 3IAGAR0NL—E. R. 

499. — Soften the macaroni by boiling it fast until it will cut 
easily without breaking, but do not let it be too soft ; then 
cut it into pieces h inch long, and with great exactness, that 
all should be of the same size ; butter a mould, stick the ends 
of the macaroni quite close together all over it, so as to look 
like a honeycomb ; tlien spread a thin layer of quenelle farce 
over the macaroni ; fill up the mould with a mince of stevred 
ox-palates cut into small pieces, and small button mushrooms, 
either pickled or fresh, moistened well with white sauce ; 
close the mould, and boil it for f of an hour ; turn it out 
very carefully, and serve it with thick white sauce and mush- 
rooms. 

Aux Truffes. — Have 6 small moulds the shape of coffee-cups, 
and not much larger ; butter them, place at the small end a 
truffle ; then encircle the truffle with macaroni, j^repared and 
cut as in the foregoing receipt, sticking each piece regularly 
round till the whole of the mould is covered ; fill it up witli 
minced sweetbread and thick white sauce. These are very 
beautiful and excellent dishes, but require great care and 
attention : they are not, however, expensive ; and as any kind 
of fowl, game, or cold fricassee may be employed, cooks are 
recommended to practise the method of placing the macaroni 
round the interior of the mould, in order to obtain the neces- 
sary proficiency when the dish appears before company. 

A la Pontife. — Boil i lb. of the longest and straightest 
tape macaroni in boiling water, with a little salt and butter ; 
when nearly done, strain and dry it ; then butter a mould, 
and lay the macaroni quite evenly over it ; if oval, the pieces 
at their full length ; if another shape, take care that the pieces 
shall meet and join ; cover the macaroni with fine farce, 
then fill up the interior with larks boned, fillets of game, 
fowl, and small pieces of fat bacon, cut round, the size of 
a sixpence, small eggs made of the yolk pounded as for 
mock-turtle, and mushrooms or truffles ; moisten it with a 
rich sauce, cover it, and let it simmer, without boiling, for 
an hour. 

PA TE DE MA CAR ONI.—E. R. 

500. — Stew some macaroni in butter and water, or broth, 
strain it, cut it into pieces, and lay it at the bottom of the 
dish, adding ham balls, made of ham pounded in a mortar,

and blended with butter ; tlien have ready any kind of game 
boned and filleted, cock's-combs or ox-jDalates previously 
blanched and stewed, sweetbread cut into dice, and mush- 
rooms, all stewed in good rich sauce ; place a layer upon the 
macaroni, then another layer of meat, and, until the pie is 
filled, add to it equal quantities of cream and gravy, cover it 
with a paste, and bake it, or omit the paste, and stew it before 
the fire in a Dutch oven. The macaroni may be mixed with 
grated Parmesan cheese. 

A?iother inode. — Sv/ell 4 oz. of pipe macaroni in milk, with 
a large onion. Put a layer at the bottom of a pie-dish, with 
some bits of butter and scraped Parmesan cheese sprinkled 
lightly over. Cover the whole with a well-seasoned beef- 
steak cut small and thin, then some more macaroni, and then 
another laver of beefsteak ; cover the whole with macaroni, 
pieces of butter, and grated cheese, instead of crust. Bake i;.i 

a slow oven. 

VER3IICELLI 

501, — Is of the same substance as macaroni, but made much 
smaller, and ftvquently put into meat soups as giving them 
additional richness ; but in English kitchens it is too sparingly 
used. To be well made the soup should be thickened v/itli 
it, and for that purpose it is preferable to macaroni. 

Semolina is of the same material, but made into small 
grains, which more easily thicken the soup into which it is 
mixed : it can also be made into an excellent pudding with 
eggs and milk, using it instead of flour, for which, and pud- 
dings of macaroni and vermicelli, see Chapter on Piiddings. 

It should be observed, as a general rule, that in using any 
of the Italian pastes — unless they should be sweetened — Par- 
mesan cheese should always form part of the dish, in the pro- 
portion of one-half the quantity to that of the paste. 

FOLENTA 
502. — Is, in Italy, made from the flour of Indian corn, but 
in this country is generally made of semolina, thus : — Put a 
little salt and 4 oz, of semolina into a quart of milk when it 
is beginning to boil, and let it continue to simmer for about 
10 minutes, stirring it occasionally to guard it from burning. 
\Yhen well thickened, pour it into a dish to cool, and when 
quite cold it will be very »olid ; then cut it into slices of less 
than an inch thick, upon which put a large grating of good 



Chap. XXI. PJCE. 36o 

Parmesan cheese, for no other kind will answer the purpose ; 
nor should any spices be used, except a little mace ; nor even 
that, unless it be made (as sometimes done) with veal brotli. 
Clarify a few ounces of fi-esh butter — though in Italy oil is 
always used — put a layer of the paste, powdered v\^ith the 
Parmesan, mixed with a little of the butter ; bake it for ^ an 
hour in a moderately heated oven, and serve it up quite hot, 
with a separate plate of the grated cheese. 



KICE. 

503. — There are but two sorts of rice in common use 
tliroughout the north of Europe, the Carolma and the Patna ; 
the one imported from Amenca, and the other from the East 
Indies. The former is the whitest, the largest in grain, ar.d 
the highest in price ; but in point of nutriment little better 
than the Patna. For curry or soup the Patna rice is the best. 
The hoilmg of rice requires 2 quarts of boiling water for each 
i lb. ; the rice should first be washed in salt and water, and 
must be allowed to simmer for 20 minutes, but not be touched 
with hand or spoon, though it may be occasionally stirred 
with a large wooden fork to keep every grain separate ; it 
should then be drained through a colander and spread thinly 
to dry upon a napkin before the fire ; or put on a dish and 
set in the oven for a few minutes. 

For savoury dislies rice should be stewed in good gravy, 
seasoned with mace, cayenne, and salt, with the addition oi 
fried onions, shalot, garlic, and pot-herbs, strained and used 
at pleasure. 

For siveet dishes. — Boil it with lemon-peel, cinnamon, or 
bay-leaves, and, when done to a proper consistency, add 
powdered sugar and cold butter, stirring it all the time till 
melted ; then pour in a little cream, and use it either as a 
covering for stevred fruits, or, if made thick enough, it may 
be placed round the sides of a dish, leaving the middle hollow 
for the svv'eets. The same plan may be adopted for all sorts 
of meat, poultry, fish, fruit, and sv/eetmeats. The sugar 
should not be added until the rice is done, as it has a tendenc>' 
to harden the grains. 



366 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXI. 

liice a la Portugaise. — In Portugal a very common mode 

of dressing rice is to stew it either in fowl broth or beef gravy, 

and boil it with tomatas, which give it a very pleasant acid. 

If in broth, only tomatas are used ; but if in gravy, onions 

are added well seasoned with salt and pei^per, sometimes with 

a clove of garlic. 

RICE FRITTERS. 

504. — Pare very thin the rind of a lemon, and boil it in 
milk, with sugar enough to sweeten it, and a cup of rice. 
When the rice is quite soft, take out the lemon-peel ; beat up 
the rice with a glass of brandy, shape it into fritters, brusli 
them with yolks of eggs, cover them with bread-crumbs, fry 
them in lard, dust them with fine sugar, and glaze with a 
salamander. 

Or : — Let the rice cool ; sjjread it out t inch thick, cut 
it in rounds with a l^-inch cutter, make an opening and 
insert a piece of red-currant jelly, apple jelly, or a fine jam 
of any kind ; then egg and crumb, carefully closing the aper- 
ture tliat admitted the jam ; fry in hot lard and glaze with 
fine suga^r. 

Pancake. — Boil \ lb. of rice to a jelly, in a small quantity 
of water : when cold, mix it with a pint of cream, 8 eggs, a 
bit of salt, and nutmeg ; stir in 8 oz. of butter just warmed, 
and add as much flour as will make the batter thick enough. 
Fry in as little lard or dripping as possible. 

Or I — Mix the yolks of 2 well-beaten eggs with a pint of 
cream, 2 oz. of sifted sugar, a little nutmeg, cinnamon, and 
mace, or a few drops of oil of almonds. Pub the pan with a 
bit of butter, and fry the pancakes thin. 

RICE BALLS. 
505.^— Pour upon ^ lb. of rice 3 pints of boiling milk, and 
boil it with a little cinnamon and lemon-peel until it is quite 
tender, then sweeten it ; allow it to remain until it is cold, 
and make it into balls. Beat up 2 eggs, roll the balls in it, 
and afterwards in grated bread-crumbs ; fry them in lard, 
drain them on a piece of paper, and serve them up covered 
with sifted sugar. 

CROQUETTES DE RIZ.—E. R. 

506. — Clean and wash 6 oz. of rice, put it into a stewpaii 
with cold w^.tor,^ and, after it has boiled for about a minute, 




OuAP. XKI. ' rJCE. 367 

strain it ; thea add t^vice the quantity of broth, and let it stew 
gently until tl.e rice will break easily with a spoon. Should 
the liquor dry too much before the rice is soft enough, add a 
little more broth. Then w^ork it well with a spoonful of white 
sauce, 2 spoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, and a very 
little white pepper. When of a suflicient consistence, make 
the rice into shapes, which may be done by hollowing them 
in the hand to the form of ^^>- .-5^^ 

a cup ; fill these shapes '^'^ 

with any kind of mince, 
either of fowl, game, or 
sweetbread, well mixed 
with white sauce ; close

them into balls, then cover Croquettes de IJiz. 

them well with the fol- 
lowing mixture : — 2 spoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, 
with 4 of bread-crumbs made to stick by rolling in the yolks of 
eggs : fry them in lard of a light brown colour. This disli 
requires great care and attention, but is excellent when done. 

CASSEROLE DE lilZ AUX (EUFS.—E.R. 
507.— Clean, wash, and stew the rice, as in the former 
receipt ; work it well with stock and an egg beaten, as the 
rice should be firm and well blended ; then make it into a 
wall, lining the inside of a mould of the requisite height : 
bake the casserole. Take the white portion of cold fowl, 
cold veal, or sweetbreads ; mince them finely, add some thick 
white sauce and mushrooms, fill the casserole, and cover the 
top with poached eggs ; cover them with glaze, and serve it 
up very hot. 

RICE FL UiniER Y. 

508. — Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of lemon-peel and 
cinnamon ; mix with a little cold milk as much rice-flour as 
will make the whole of a good consistency, sweeten, and add 
a spoonful of peach-water, or a bitter almond beaten ; boil it, 
but take care it does not burn ; pour it into a shape or pint 
basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn the flummery 
into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or custard, round ; 
or put a teacupful of cream into ^ pint of new milk, a glass of 
white wine, ^ a lemon squeezed, and sugar, and pour over it. 



368 MODEPtN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXI. 

Bice Paste. — Take ground rice and butter, work it like 
short crust, adding a little sugar to make it eat crisply, only 
using wlieaten flour to roll it out with on the board ; more or 
less butter must be added, according to the richness required. 

Or, if for relisliijig things : — Clean and jrat some rice, 
with an onion, and a little water and milk, or milk only, into 
a saucepan, and simmer till it swells. Put seasoned chops 
into a dish, and cover it with the rice ; by the addition of an 
egg the rice will adhere better. 



EGGS. 

509. — Eggs are in such general use that the celebrated 
' Almanack des Gourmajids ' enumerates no less than 300 
diiferent modes of serving them in France ; and although 
either our deficiency in culinary science, or our want of gas- 
tronomic taste, precludes the entire catalogue from being 
adopted by us, yet sufficient receipts will, we trust, be found 
here to gratify the palate of most of our readers. 

There are of course several sorts of eggs, according to the 
species of poultry which produce them. The turkey egg is the 
L.rgest and the most delicate, after which, in point of flavour, 
is the guinea-hen's, and, in that of size, those of the goose and 
duck. Although all these are employed in cookery, yet the 
eggs of the common " barn - door fowl " are those most 
generally used when served up separately and boiled in the 
shell, in which case the main point is their entire freshness. 
This can partly be judged of by putting them between you 
and the light, and seeing that the vrliite is clear and the yolk 
unclouded ; for although nothing can be more delicately 
nutritive when newly laid, few things can be more nauseo>*s 
when they are stale. 

TO KEEP EGGS FOR WIXTER USE. 
510. — Pour a full gallon of boiling water on 2 quaxts of 
quicklime and h lb. of salt ; when cold, mix into it an ounce 
of cream of tartar. The day following put in the eggs. After 
the lime has been stirred well into the boiling water, a large 
part of it will settle at the bottom of the vessel, on which the 
eggs will remain. Keep them covered with the liquor, and 
they will keep for two years. 



Chai'. XXI. EGGS. 369 

TO BOIL EGGS. 

511. — To effect the simple process of boiling demands con- 
stant attention, as ^ a minute more or less may spoil the egg 
for a fastidious palate. There are various modes employed 
by different cooks ; some putting them into cold water, and, 
when it boils, allowing the eggs to remain in it for a minute 
longer ; others taking them out immediately ; while others, 
again, prefer putting them into boiling water, and there 
leaving them until done. That lime is most com.monly 3 
minutes, and seldom less ; but many persons object to their 
being left so soft, and 4 or 5 minutes are not unusual if the 
eggs are not " new-laid." 10 minutes are required for 
making the yolks hard enough for salad, after Avhich the 
eggs should be put for some time into cold water to harden, 
or the yolks will not readily incorporate with the condiments. 

It should however be understood that, in whatever way the 
egg is to be boiled, it should be completely covered with 
vvater ; that, if put into the water while boiling, the shell is 
subject to being cracked ; and if boiled too suddenly, the 
white becomes hard, while the yolk remains coraparativelv 
soft. The cook should therefore be provided Avith minute 
glasses of various sizes — from 1 minute to 5 — to mark the 
time ; for they are more accurate than the hand of a kitchen 
clock, and do not require so much watching. 

TO POACH EGGS 

512. — Is to boil them ivithout their shells, and requires 
still greater care. The water must be perfectly pure, or it 
will stain the white of the egg, and the yolk must be only just 
so much done as to fix itself firmly in the centre of the white ; 
the eg^, though required to be quite fresh, yet should not be 
poached on the same day on which it has been laid, as, when 
in that milky state, the white and yolk will not combine with 
the necessary degree of firmness ; they should be a couple of 
days old. 

Put a moderate quantity of y»-ater into a broad fiat stewpan. 
French cooks add to it, when boiling, a spoonful of vinegar 
and a little ' salt. Take the pan off the fire whilst putting in 
the eggs ; break the eg^ into a teacup or small ladle, and 
turn it gently into the water,. so as to prevent the yolk from 
being mixed with the white : let them stand till beginning 
to set ; then let the eggs boil gently until j^ou perceive that 

11 a 



370 MODEPtX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXI. 

ihej are done, hj the white being set, and tlie yolk appearing 
throngli it in a comparatively soft state ; then take each from 
the water with an egg-slice, and pare off any ragged edges 
which may appear aronnd it, before sending them to table. 
This latter operation, however, if not quickly done, cools the 
egg, which ought to be served quite hot, to avoid which incon- 
venience, a little machine for poaching has been invented in 
France. A tin cup large enough to contain the egg when 
poached is perforated with several holes ; and being- placed 
in the boiling water, the egg is broken into it, but, when taken 
up, retains its roundness without cutting. It has, however, 
the imperfection of not alloT^ing the egg to slide from the cup 
to any substance on which it is to be placed. This, however, 
may be easily rectified by turning the egg over upon the toast, 
which, if carefully done, answers quite as well. The larger 
machine is made to contain as manv as 4 Ci^gs. It is fixed 
upon trivets, and not deeper than a dripping-pan ; but each 
small machine being furnished with a handle, a single egg 
can be removed, and put on whatever the cook chooses. 

Poached eggs are commonly placed upon buttered toast, 
broiled ham, or boiled spinach ; but in France they are not 
imcommonly served in a consomme of beef. Indeed, we have 
there seen them brought up singly, in tablespoons filled with 
the gravy, and each swallowed up at a mouthful. 

OJIELETTB. 

513. — In France, and indeed throughout the Continent, this 
is the most usual mode of dressing eggs, after that of boiling 
them in the shell, as being in small families a sure resource 
to fall back upon in cases of emergency. It is, however, extra- 
ordinary that, in England, scarcely any of the common cooks 
succeed in bringing them to table nicely dressed, though 
nothing can be more simple. In the ordinary way the eggs 
are made into a batter ; but if time be allowed, this should be 
done some hours before the omelet is wanted, and the batter 
again whisked up just before it is to be dressed. 

4 eggs will make a very pretty-sized omelet, but the 
number of eggs must of course depend on the size required. 
If sweet herbs be put in, a good deal of parsley should form 
part ; tarragon gives a high flavour, and chives or shalots are 
.not unfrequently used, but care should be taken that tho 
flavour should not overpower that of the other ingredients. 



Chap. XXI. EGGS. 371 

Omelets are judiciously varied by mixiiig grated ham or 
tongue vriih minced anchovies, when served at supper or as a 
side-dish at dinner ; but when intended for the breakfast- 
table, it is more delicate to make them of eggs alone. 

Although a common frying-pan may be used, yet one made 
on purpose, not larger than the size of a desseit-plate, should 
be employed, so as not to allow the omelet too much spread- 
ing, for it should always be kept of a certain degree of thick- 
ness to secm-e the softness of the inside. It is therefore only 
to be fried on one side, and when the under is bro\vned and 
the upper brought to a moderate state of consistence, the 
fried side is to be folded over the other in thi-ee. 

Butter is better than either lard or dripping for the fi'ying 
of an omelet. Any sort of pot-herbs is a.dmissible ; and many 
sorts of minced fowl and fish are prepared in that manner 
throughout the Continent. There are himdreds of receipts for 
omelets, but the j)rinciple is the same in all, the diiicrence 
being only in the fiavoming. 

Au nature!. — Take 4 eggs, beat the yolks and whites toge- 
ther with a tablespoonful of milk, a little salt and pepper ; put 
2 oz. of butter into a frying-pan to boil, and let it remain until 
it begins to brown ; pour the batter into it, and let it remain 
quiet for a minute ; tui'n up the edges of the omelet gently 
from the bottom of the pan with a fork ; shake it, to keep it 
from biu-ning at the bottom, and fiy it till of a bright brown. 
It will not take more than 5 minutes fi"ying. 

Aux fines Herhes. — Beat up 4 eggs with a little cream, salt, 
pepper, chives, and parsley, minced very small. Put a piece 
of butter half the size of an egg into the frying-pan ; let it 
begin to brown ; pour in the omelet, and allow it to set a 
little ; then stir it about, to allow more of the mixtm-e to 
become bro^n. When that is done, tiu'n it over to double it ; 
but as in browning the lower side the iijj]:'^' will sometimes 
appear too soft, in that case make a slight use of the sala- 
mander, to give it firmness ; put the dish on the frying-pan, 
and tiu'n it over. Let the fire be clear, but not too hot. 

Or : — Take 4 eggs and 4 tablespoonfuls of milk, well beaten 
together ; add one tablespoonful of pai'sley chopped very fine, 
a little lemon-thyme, maijoram, or tarragon, a teaspoonful of 
grated onion, a little essence of anchovies or Reading sauce, 
and a few gi'ains of cayenne pepper ; fry quickly, and fold it 



372 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKErvY. Chap. XXT. 

Ill three ; put a little clear gravy in the dish. This is an ex- 
cellent receipt. 

Aux Con/iticres. — Beat up 8 eggs with a tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, a little nutmeg, a pinch of salt, some finely- 
chopped lemon-peel, and a wineglass of cream, or about i oz. 
of butter. Make an omelet-pan hot, put in a small piece of 
butter, and, when the eggs are thoroughly mixed, pour tliein 
into the pan ; stir it about, and, when set, arrange the omelet 
neatly in the pan ; lay on 2 spoonfuls of jam, roll it up, and 
glaze it with sugar and the salamander. Any of the preserved 
fruits, when prepared as jam, will answer the purpose. 

l/7ie Omelette aux Amandes is also looked upon as a deli- 
cacy, and made by substituting almond-flour, or pounded sweet 
almonds, for jam. 

Une Omehite d" Hint res may be made v.ith 4 raw ^ggs, a 
little cream, beaten up either with or without sweet herbs and 
grated ham, but seasoned with a little salt, pepper, and nutmeg, 
together with a dozen of oysters bearded, dried, minced very 
small, and fried in butter. 

Omelette a la Tartare. — Steam 2 Iiandfuls of sorrel, and, 
having picked and chopped it, stew it in gravy with a little 
butter and cayenne pepper ; put it into a plain omelet, and 
cover the w.liole with grated bread, grated Parmesan cheese, 
and a little melted butter ; make an edging all round with 
fried bread, and brown the top with a salamander. 

OMELETTE SOUFFLEE. 

514. — Take 6 eggs, separate the whites from the yolks, add 
to the yolks a tablespoonful of arrowroot or potato-tlour, 6 oz. 
of pounded loaf-sugar, some grated lemon-peel, and a small 
quantity of lemon-zest, or chopped peel, or orange-flower 
water. Beat the whole together for several minutes, until 
they are made into a batter, and then v\-hip the whites until 
they become a froth ; stir in lightly the batter. Have ready 
an omelet-pan of the proper size heated upon the stove ; put 
into it i lb. of butter, and when it begins to boil put the whole 
into the pan, and stir it with a spoon carefully until it becomes 
partially firm. That done, turn it out upon a small circular 
dish, of silver or metal, as the omelet ought to acquire the 
form of a dome, and the dish be placed in a ^sery moderately 
Itoated oven for at least 10 minutes or i of an liour, accordiiig 



Ciur. XXI. EGGS. 373 

to the care and nicety with which it has been made ; after 
which it will have risen into a pufF of considerable height, 
similar to the fashionable supper dish, "trifle." It should 
then be sprinkled with a little powdered sugar, the salamander 
held over it, and be served immediately, or it will soon become 
flat in flavour and appearance. 

Souffle Frangais. — Put into a stewpan 1 oz. of butter ; 
when melted, add 2 tablespoonfuls of flour ; stir them well 
over the fire, so that the flour be thoroughly cooked, but not 
coloured ; add by degrees a wineglass of boiling cream, and 
four times that quantity of boiling milk ; work it quite smootJi, 
take it off the fire, add 4 yolks of eggs, sugar to palate, a grain 
of salt, and a tablespoonful of orange-flovrer water ; whip up 
strongly the whites of 8 eggs, mix them lightly in the batter, 
put the whole into a souffle dish, and bake for an hour. 

The flavour of this souflle may be varied according to fancy, 
omitting the orange-flovrer vrater, and substituting either va- 
nilla, cura9oa, noyeau, maraschiijo, chocolate, coffee, &c. 

CEUFS BllOUILLES. 

515. — Break 4 or 6 eggs ; beat them and put them into a 
saucepan with a piece of butter, a little salt, and a spoonful 
of sauce or gravy, which makes the eggs softer ; stir them 
over the fire until sufticiently thick ; serve on a plate garnished 
with toasted bread. To eggs dressed this way, minced truffles, 
ham, mushrooms, &c., may be added. The difference be- 
tween this and an omelet is, that an omelet is compact and 
turns out smooth, v^^hereas ceufs hrGtiilles are less done, and are 
therefore broken. 

In Ireland, vvhere it is in general use, it is usually served 
upon hot buttered toast, and is there called •' buttered eggs.'' 
It is also very common in France, where it is usually served 
for breakfast. 

Or : — Butter a dish well, sprinkle it with salt, then break 
the eggs very carefully so as not to disturb the yolk ; add a 
little more salt and some white pepper ; melt a small quantity 
of butter, pour it gently over, with 1 or 2 spoonfuls of cream. 
Put the dish over a slow fire, and finish the eggs by covering 
them with a red-hot shovel. 

A very pretty dish of Eggs is made thus : — Break some ^gg'f- 
into a small tart-dish, without injuring the yolks, or laying 
one over the other. Drop on them some warm butter, and 



374 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEPxT. Chap. XXL 

lightly strew crumbs of bread. Put it in the oven until the 
whites be set, and serve with a Vvreath of parsley round the 
edge. 

Eggs aux fines Herhes, — Poach 4 eggs carefulty, put them 
upon the dish, and pour over them the following sauce : — a 
glass of white wine, with some chopped parsley, chives, salt 
and pepper, and a piece of butter rolled in flour. Let all boil 
for 10 minutes ; pour it over the eggs ; cover the whole with 
bread-crumbs, dried and browned. 

Burnt buttered Eggs. — Burn the butter in a frying-pan ; 
break the eggs upon a dish, preserving them whole as if 
intended to be poached ; season them with salt and a little 
nutmeg ; pour a part of the burnt butter boiling hot over the 
eggs, and then slide them over the rest of the butter ; put 
them on a slow fire, and finish by browning them with a red- 
hot shovel or salamander. 

EGGS A LA DUG HESSE. 

516. — Boil 2 quarts of milk with 2 laurel or bay leaves, 
some cinnamon, and green lemon-peel ; when the milk is well- 
llavoured, strain into a shallov/ stewpan, and keep it boiling ; 
whip up the whites of 3 eggs to a strong froth or snow, as it is 
technically called ; take a tablespoonful, and drop into the 
boiling milk ; when all the eggs are in, turn them, and they

thicken some of the milk v/ith arrowroot, or with the yolks, 
imd pour over the eggs. 

WHITE FRICASSEE OF EGGS.— E.R. 

517. — Put 2 oz. of butter into a stev/pan, and when melted 
adi chopped parsley, a small piece of shalot chopped finely, 
and mushrooms also chopped, with pepper and salt. Stew 
till the seasoning is done, then add a cupful of cream ; add 
sufficient flour to thicken the sauce, and iDoil it well. Boil 4 
or 6 eggs hard, and cut them into slices — each egg should 
make 5 or 6 ; lay the eggs in, give it a boil, and serve up. 

A brown fricassee is made the same way, with good rich 
brown gravy instead of cream. 

EGG ALB.—E. R. 
518. — Boil 6 eggs until very hard, remove the shells, and 
cut them across, preserving the whites in the form of cups; 



Chap. SXI. EGGS. 375 

mince the yolks in small cubes with cold ham, parsley, and 
salt ; mix the minced ingredients with cream until they form 
a thick paste, but do not break the little cubes ; then fill tlie 
caps formed of the whites with this compound, heaped up in 
the middle, cutting off a piece from the round end to make 
th.em stand ; place them in a dish, and pour white sauce over 
them. 

Or : — Boil the eggs hard, taking off the shells carefully ; 
then cut them in halves lengthwise ; take out the yolks ; soak 
some bread-crumbs in milk, press it rather dry, add salt, 
pepper, and nutmeg, a little chopped parsley, and the yolks of 
the eggs rubbed into a lump of butter ; mix these well together, 
and moisten with cream ; fill the whites to make up the shape 
of an egg, strew them with bread-crumbs, and fry in butter to 
a light brown. Serve up quite hot. 

Or : — Boil eggs hard ; when cold cut the whites in halves, 
put the yolk entire into one half, cover it with forcemeat, 
lay the white upon its back and fry it ; or pound the yolk 
and forcemeat together until they form a paste, and fill up 
the cavity of the white ; serve with either brown or white 
sauce. 

A la Carmelite. — Boil 6 eggs hard, cut them in halves the 
long way, take out the yolks and chop them very fine with 
parsley, sorrel, and boiled onions ; season with pepper and 
salt ; mix them up with a little melted butter, and fill the 
whites ; heat them until thoroughly hot in white sauce made 
thus : — Take \ pint of cream, seasoned with a blade of mace ; 
melt in it 2 oz. of butter ; stir it very Vv^ell, adding sufficient 
flour to keep the butter from oiling, and just before dishing 
squeeze in a little lemon-juice. 

A la Gruyere. — Put \ lb. of Gruyere cheese into a stew- 
pan with a small piece of butter, some chives and parsley 
chopped fine, a very little grated nutmeg, some salt, and ^ a 
teacupful of veal-stock ; set it over a gentle fire, and stir it 
till the cheese is melted. Beat up 4 eggs, and set it over the 
fire again ; stir it till sufficiently done, then take it off, and 
garnish with sippets of toasted bread. 

CEUFS FARC IS. 

519. — Boil 6 eggs hard, remove the shells, but leave the ^gg'^ 
whole ; cover them with a rich forcemeat made with scrapea

liam, pounded anchovy, pounded veal, and bacon fat, well 
pounded together and highly seasoned ; brush them with the 
yolk of egg, and dredge them with bread-crumbs or vermicelli ; 
fry them a pale gold colour, or put them for i of an hour in 
an oven, and serve them up with gravy in the dish. 

Iiln Puree. — Boil 6 eggs hard ; when cold take out the 
yolks and beat them in a mortar, with butter, salt, nutmeg, 
pepper, and minced parsley, adding 3 raw yolks ; chop the 
whites very small, and put them into a stewpan with some 
good gravy ; do not let them boil, but shake them until they 
have a consistency ; then place them round the dish they are 
to be served in. Take the yolks out of the mortar, and pass 
them through a colander into the same dish ; garnish with 
bread dipped in yolks of eggs. Place the dish in an oven, and 
v.'hen lightly browned it will be done. 

CEufs sur Ic plat is a German mode of frying an egg by 
means of a small cheese-plate, which, being thoroughly warmed, 
is greased in the indented part with a bit of butter or a very 
little salad-oil, and into this part the egg is broken from the 
shell, thus retaining the exact rotundity of the plate, which is 
then placed upon the gridiron over a good fire. It may be 
slightly browned, if thought lit, with a salamander, but does 
not need it ; and though quite as delicate, yet renders the egg 
rather more savoury than by poaching. 

EGGS AND VEGETABLES. 

520. — Eggs and Spinach. — Poach half a dozen eggs, trim 
them nicely, and serve them upon stewed spinach. 

Eggs and Onions^ or a la Tripe. — Skin 6 or 8 onions, 
mince them, put some butter into a stewpan and melt it, add 
about 2 spoonfuls of flour, mix both well together, then add 
the onions, and wet them with milk, cream, or water ; let them 
stew, taking care that the onions and butter do not become 
brown ; season with a little salt and white pepper ; cut some 
hard esffs into slices, and when the sauce is ready put them in ; 
make the whole very hot, and serve it up. 

Or : — Slice some onions very finely, pepper them well with 
cayenne pepper, and fry them in butter ; take them out oi 
the pan, drain them before the fire from the fat, put them on 
a dish, and squeeze lemon-juice over them sufficient to satu- 
rate a\id render them very acid. Fry or poach 6 eggs, trim 



CHAr. XXT. CHEESE. 



them, nicely, lay them upon the onions, and serve them very 
]iot. 

(Eiifs a la Francaise. — A very common way of dressing 
eggs in France is to put a piece of butter in a stewpan with 
some green onions chopped fine, and a little minced parsley ; 
shake a little flour over them, and add a teacupful of good 
broth ; stir it over the fire till it becomes of a proper thickness, 
and skim it well ; put in some eggs boiled hard and sliced, 
some salt, and a little cayenne ; beat up the yolk of an egg 
with a small teacupful of cream, add this to the other ingre- 
dients with the juice of ^ a lemon, let all boil together a few 
minutes, and serve hot with sippets of bread. 

Eggs and Asparagus. — Cut some of the thin green aspa- 
ragus to the size of small peas, boil them quickly, and drain 
them. Beat up some eggs with a little pepper and salt, and 
put them into the stewpan with the asparagus ; add a good 
piece of fresh butter, and keep stirring it as long as it is on the 
fire to prevent it from burning ; v/hen sufficiently thick take it 
off, spread a piece of thick toast in a dish, and pour over it the 
asparagus and eggs. 

Eggs and Artichokes are also very nice as an entre at 
dinner, or a corner dish at a supper-table. The bottoms, after 
being stripped of the leaves, to be boiled in hard water, and, 
when sufficiently done, place on each the half of a hard egg, 
leaving the round end uppermost. They may be eaten either 
cold or hot : if cold, covered with cream seasoned only witli 
a little nutmeg ; or, if hot, either with melted butter or rich 
gravy.

EGGS AND CHEESE 

621. — Are mixed together in various ways by French cooks 
under the names oi fondus or fondeaux, ramequins, and other 
titles, for the purposes of preparing entr&niets, or side-dishes, 
for elegant tables. 

Gruyere and Parmesan are the most proper sorts to be thus 
used, but any dry cheese, of good flavour, may be employed. 

FONDEAV.

and a little >^alt ; keep stirring it over the fire until it is as thick 
as melted butter; then add about ^ lb. of Parmesan cheese finely 
grated. Mix it all well together until it is half cold ; then take 
4 eggs, separate the yolks from the whites, put the former to 
the cheese, and beat it well together. Then l3eat the whites to a 
solid froth, and add them to the rest ; pour the mixture into an 
ornamented mould or a deep dish lined with paper, cut in a 
fringe at the top, and only half filled, as it will rise very high. 
The oven must be very hot, in order to cause the rising, and 
the dish must be served immediately, or it will fall ; to prevent 
which, let the cover be of metal, strongly heated : 20 minutes 
ought to bake it. 

Or : — Slice a stale penny roll ; pour over it f pint of boiling 
milk ; when soaked, beat it well, and mix with it i- lb. each of 
Cheshire and double Gloucester cheese finely grated, with the 
yolks of 4 eggs well whisked. All this may be prepared when 
most convenient ; immediately before it is wanted beat tlie 
whites of the 4 eggs into a solid froth and add them ; pour the 
whole into the paper forms, and bake them to your taste. 

JS?i caisses. — Take i lb. of Swiss cheese, 2 oz. of Parme- 
san, and a piece of cream-cheese ; pound the whole in a mortar 
with a little pepper and salt, then mix in 4 or 5 eggs, one at a 
time ; fill 12 small paper cases, and put them for a short time 
in the oven to give a fine colour. Ten minutes will bake them 
in a Dutch oven placed before a good fire. 

Fondeaux of a small size may be made in either of the above 
modes, and put into little paper moulds of any fancied form, 
but only half filled. 

RAME QUINS. 

523. — A la Parisienne. — Boil t pint of milk and half the 
quantity of cream ; melt 1 oz. of butter and a little salt ; mix 
in a spoonful of flour, and stir it over the fire for 5 minutes ; 
pour in the milk and cream by degrees, and work it smooth, 
taking care that it is thoroughly cooked. Then take it oflT, and 
add -J lb. of grated cheese, some pepper, and an atom of 
nutmeg, with a very little powdered sugar, the yolks of 8 
eggs, and the whites of 2, well beaten ; when perfectly mixed, 
add the whites of 6 eggs beaten to a frcth. The batter 
should be as thick as cream. Make little paper trays, fill 
them 8 parts full, and bake them in a very slow oven J 8 
minutes 



Chap. XXT. CHEESE. 379 

Or : — Take 2 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of flour, 2 oz. of melted 
butter, and 2 of grated cheese ; mix all well together, and bake 
it in moulds or tart-pans for i of an hour. 

Juried Ramequins. — Grate ^ lb. of cheese, and melt 2 oz. 
of butter ; when the latter is getting cool, mix it with the 
cheese and the whites of 3 eggs w^ll beaten. Lay buttered 
papers on a frying-pan, put slices of bread upon it, and lay 
the cheese on the top ; set it on the fire for about 5 minutes, 
then take it off, and brown it with a salamander. 

Dutch Ramequin. — Scrape some old Cheshire cheese, pound 
it, with a lump of butter and the yolk of an egg boiled hard, 
in a marble mortar. When very well mixed, and quite smooth, 
spread it on slices of toasted bread and butter ; hold a salaman- 
der over them, and serve them quite hot. 

With Wine or Ale. — Scrape 1 lb. of Cheshire and the same 
of Gloucester cheese ; melt, without oiling, i lb. of butter ; 
then beat all in a mortar with the yolks of 4 eggs, the inside 
of a French roll boiled in milk, and a wineglass of wine or ale. 
^Yhen thoroughly mixed, add the whites of the eggs, previ- 
ously beaten to a froth. Put the composition into paper cases, 
rather long than square, and bake them in a Dutch oven. 

STEIFED CHEESE.— E. R. 

524. — Grate 2 oz. of cheese ; put it into a basin ; mix with 
it a small teacupful of cream and an egg beaten and strained. 
Put into a small saucepan 1 oz. or -j oz. of butter, according 
to the richness of the cheese ; let it melt, then stir in the other 
ingredients, and let it boil until well m.ixed. Serve it hot 
either browned or plain. The brown looks prettier, but the 
plain eats better. 

With Ale. — Cut the cheese into slices, pare off the rind, 
and put it into a dish over a lamp ; then pour on as much alo 
as will cover it, and let it stew until the cheese is dissolved. 
This is a Welsh method, and a very good one. The cheese 
may be spread with mustard. 

A vei'y delicious sort of paste may also be made of any of the 
rich cheeses, Neufchcltel, fromage de Brie, or Stilton, stewed 
with cream and yolk of egg, either seasoned savourily or sweet- 
ened ; and eaten hot or cold.

PxiXCAKES AND FRITTERS. \ 

526. — Although Qgg forms the chief foundation of all pan- '\ 

cakes, they are yet made in various ways according to different ; 

tastes and countries. \ 

Take 1 lb. of flour ; mix it with 6 eggs, a tablespoonful oi j 
brandy, a good pinch of salt, 2 tablespoonfuls of orange-flower 

water, and as much milk as \n\\ give the batter a proper con- ' 

sistency ; m.elt a piece of butter or lard in a frying-pan ; pour ' 

in as much batter as will cover the pan ; when brown on one . 

side, with a knife loosen the edges of the pancake all round, ; 

and turn and brown it on the other side ; roll each pancake \ 

up, and send them to table very hot, pov/dered with sugar. ; 

Hand round sugar, either raw or pounded, together with | 

lemon and Seville orange. \ 

Or : — 1 lb. of flour, 1 quart of milk, 6 eggs, ^ oz. of salt, 4 \ 

oz. of pounded sugar, and peel of 1 lemon grated, with pounded j 

sweet spice, or not, according to fancy ; fry as usual, and serve ^ 

each separately on a plate. " I

IMake it into thick batter with fine flour ; slice the apples in 
rounds, cut out the core, dust them with fine sugar, and let 
tliem so remain for 2 hours ; then dip each slice in batterj 
and fry them in plenty of boiling lard over a quick fire. They 
require lard sufficient to swim in. Glaze with sugar. 

Make a batter with flour and table beer, adding 2 table- 
spoonfuls of oil to 1 lb. of flour ; make it thick, and have it 
ready 2 hours before using it. 

Or : — Make a batter as thick as paste, of 1 tablespoonful 
of olive-oil, a little salt, the yolks of 4 eggs, a sf)oonful of 
orange-flower water, with as much flour as will thicken it ; 
beat the whites of 2 eggs to snow,' and stir it lightly in. This 
batter ought to be made an hour or tv»'o before it is used, that 
it may become lighter by fermentation. Put the fruit, well 
covered with this batter, into hot lard or butter, and fry. If 
the fritters are required to be unusually good, let the fruit 
marinate in brandy and sugar some hours before frying. Take 
the fritters out when of a fine light yellow, let them drain on 
a coarse cloth, sprinkle them with sugar, and serve quite hot. 

Crhne Frite aux Aniandes. — ^Boil 1 pint of milk with 2 
bay-leaves, a little .^reen lemon-peel, and a small piece of 
cinnamon. When the flavour is extracted, strain it ; add 2 
tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, and sugar to palate : stir it wel] 
over the fire, and add tlie yolks of 4 eggs. 2 oz. of clioj)ped 
almonds, and a v/ineglass of cream. Cook the whole over the 
fire for about 4 minutes, stirring it all the time ; break in 2 
eggs ; then pour it on a tin which has been well buttered, 
s]iread it about h inch thick, put it into the oven for 10 
minutes ; let it get thoroughly cool, cut out with a 2-inch 
round cutter, dip into fine bread-crumbs, then into Q^^ beat 
up very thin, and again into crumbs; fry in hot lard; dust 
over with sugar, and send to table. 

Spanish Fritters. — Cut. the crumb of a Fiench roll into 
lengths as thick as your finger, in what shape you will. Soa«v 
in some cream, nutmeg, sugar, pounded cinnamon, and an 
G^g. When well soaked, fry of a nice brown, and serve with 
butter, wine, and sugar-sauce. 

French Fritters. — Mix 2 eggs, well beaten and strained,

1 large spoonful of orange-flower water or cinnamon-water, 
1 oz. of blanched almonds beaten to a paste, 2 oz. of white 
sugar, and i of a small nutmeg. Pound it all till it become 
smooth batter. Have ready a large stewpan half full of fine 
lard quite hot, and drop the batter into it, the size of large 
nuts, until the surface be filled ; as they brown, turn them : 
they will be very large ; when done, remove them on clean 
paper, in a dish l3efore the fire, and do the remainder. Serve 
as quickly as possible. They are excellent. 

Italian Fritters. — Throughout Italy fritters are almost 
daily served at all good tables, and made of livers of fowls, 
sweetbread, brains, and various articles, there called '' frutti 
di mare^'' collected on the sea-shores from the tribes of small 
fish, muscles, crabs, and shell-fish, which there abound, and 
mixed together in different ways, fish, fowl, and fruit, all fried 
in oil or batter. 

Potato Fritters. — Boil 2 large potatoes, scrape them fine , 
beat 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, and add 1 large spoonful 
of cream, another of sweet wine, a squeeze of lemon, and a 
little nutmeg. Beat this batter ^ an hour at least. It will 
be extremely light. Put a good quantity of fine lard in a 
stewpan, and drop a spoonful of the batter at a time into it. 
Fry them, and serve, as a sauce, a glass of white wine, the 
juice of a lemon, 1 dessertspoonful of peach-leaf or almond 
water, and some white sugar, warmed together. Not to be 
served in the dish. 

Or : — Slice potatoes thin, dip them in a fine batter, and 
fry. Serve with white sugar sifted over them. Lemon-peel 
and a spoonful of orange-flower water should be added to the 
batter. 

Or : — Boil 1 lb. of floury potatoes, bruise them in a mortar, 
and add to them 2 oz. of butter, with the yolks of a couple of 
eggs seasoned with a little pepper and salt. Mix all well 
together ; roll it into balls the size of an egg, and fiy them 
brown. Some persons like the addition of a finely minced 
shalot. 

BucJtwheat Fritters, or " JBockingsJ^ — Mix 3 oz. of buck- 
wheat flour with a teacupful of warm milk and a spoonful of 
yeast ; let it rise before the fire about an hour ; then mix 4 
>ggs, well beaten, and as much milk as will make the batter

the usual thickness for pancakes, and fry them in tlie sanif 
way. 

Card Fritters. — Eub down in a mortar a quart of dried 
curd, with the yolks of 8 and whites of 4 well-beaten eggs, 
2 oz. of sifted sugar, ^ a nutmeg, and ^ a spoonful of flour. 
Drop the batter into a frying-pan, with a little butter or fine 
lard. 

Orange and Sweetmeat Fritters. — Take off the rind of 2 
oranges, removing all the white skin ; then cut the oranges in 
slices across, and take out all the pips ; dip the slices of 
orange in batter, as for apple fritters, and fry them. Servo 
with powdered sugar upon each fritter. 

Coloured Fritters. — Boil a large beet-root until it is tender ; 
beat it fine in a marble mortar. Add the yolks of 4 eggs, 2 
spoonfuls of flour and 3 of cream, the juice and peel of ^ a 
lemon, ^ a nutmeg, and a glass of brandy. Mix all well 
together, and fry the fritters in butler. Garnish them witli 
green sweetmeats, preserved apricots, or sprigs of myrtle. 

FISH AND 3IEAT FRITTERS.— E. R. 

531. — Kidney Fritters. — Beat 4 eggs well ; add a tcacup- 
ful of cream, some pepper and salt, with a little pounded mace, 
parsley, and chives, shred fine, and chopped mushroom. To 
this batter add also some of the kidney with the fat of a loin 
of veal minced ; mix all thoroughly together ; rub the pan 
well with butter, and pour in the ingredients. Keep stirring 
it while it is on the fire or stove, so as to keep it from spreading 
out too thin. When sufficiently done, make it of a light brown 
by means of a salamander, or by holding it for a minute or 
two before the fire. 

Oyster Fritters. — Beard the 03^sters, dip them into a thick 
batter, made rich with egg, or, what is better, into an omelette, 
and then in crumbs of bread ; fry them : they are an excellent 
garnish for fried fish. 

BEIGNET. 

532. — Mix and work well together ^ lb. of flour and 2 
oz. of butter, or 3 tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, and make it into 
a batter with some warm water ; then mix into the batter a 
couple of raw eggs, keeping the yolk of 1 for browning. The 
materials may thus be made of any degree of consistency, so as

to act as thick batter, or as thin paste by the addition of a 
little flour ; and being made into small balls, are spread with 
the remaining yolk of egg, powdered usually with sugar, and 
fried in hot lard ; and, when ready to be served, put them for 
a moment on a hair sieve, to drain off the fat. 

If made solely with paste, without mince of any kind, they 
should have another egg, and the batter be more continually 
beaten, so as to render the beignets light ; then, when pre- 
pared for dressing, take a spoonful of the batter formed into a 
ball, and drop it into the boiling lard. A large dishful will 
be fried in 6 or 7 minutes. 



CHAPTER XXII. 
PASTE — MEAT PIES — FISH PIES. 

VAEIOUS SORTS OF PASTE. 

533. — In making paste for pies great care should be taken 
that the flour be well dried ; for the finer kinds of paste it 
ought also to be sifted. The very best salt butter is perhaps 
the best material for making paste. Some persons employ 
lard, or equal parts of lard and butter ; and clarified dripping 
is an excellent substitute. 

An adept in pastry never leaves any part of it adhering to 
the board or dish used in making. The best thing to make it 
upon is a slab of marble or slate ; which substances cause less 
waste, being cold and smooth. The coolest part of the house, 
and of the day, should be chosen for the process ; the hands 
should be previously washed in very hot water, and the less 
they touch the paste the better and lighter it will prove ; nor 
sliould it be rolled much. 

In whatever way paste be made, wetting it much will render 
it tough. 

Salt butter of the best quality makes a fine flaky crust ; for 
sweet things, wash it. In making pie-crust lard is, however, 
better than butter ; and in making tlie paste it is sometimes 
mixed with the flour in a dry state. 



Chap. XXII. PASTE. 387 

Heating the oven properly is a very essential point in baking 
the various sorts of paste to be here enumerated. 

Maised pies must be put into a quick oven, or the crust will 
fall. The cook should accurately know the proper heat for 
each article, as opening the door to observe their progress lets 
in the air, and often spoils them. They require from -s- to a 
full hour more than when baked in a dish. 

CRUST FOR RAISED PIES. 

534. — Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quan- 
tity of fresh dripping, or of butter, in the proportion of 2 oz. of 
fat to 1 pint of water. While hot, mix this with as much flour 
as you will want, making the paste as stiff as you can to be 
smooth, which it will become by good kneading and beating 
it with the rolling-pin. When quite smooth put a lump into 
a cloth, or under a pan, to soak till nearly cold. 

In raising paste it should be brought to a firm consistency, 
and of sufficient thickness to hold the meat together ; it should 
therefore not be too rich, and it is easier to be worked if 
moderately warm than cold. The proper way to raise the 
crust is by placing the left hand on the lump of paste, and 
with the right keep working it up the back of the hand, till all 
be of the proper shape and thickness. When v.orked into the 
desired form the meat is then put into the pie, and, when quite 
full, the lid is put on and fixed to the wall or side ; the top 
being ornamented with some device, also made of paste. Before 
putting it in the oven glaze it all over with white of e^^. 

Those who have not a good hand at raising crust may roll 
the paste of a proper thickness, and cut out the top and bottom 
of the pie, then a long piece for the sides, then cement the 
bottom to the sides with e^^, bringing the former rather 
farther out, and pinching both together : put eg^ between the 
edges of the paste to make it adhere at the sides. Fill the pie, 
put on the cover, and pinch it and the side crust together. 
The same mode o? uniting the paste is to be observed if the 
sides are pressed into a tin form, in which the paste must be 
baked, after it shall be filled and covered : ^ the tin should be 
buttered, and carefully taken off when done enough ; and as 

* In lining a tin form, put in the sides first, having cut the paste rather 
deeper than the tin, so as to allow for its lying a little on the bottom, and 
that no joint may appear | then cut a piece sufficiently large to cover the 
whole bottom.

388 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXII. 

the form usually makes the sides of a lighter colour than is 
proper, the pie should be put into the oven again for i of an 
hour. 

For Venison Pasty or Perigord Pie. — To z peck of fine 
flour use 2^ lbs. of butter and 4 eggs ; mix into paste with 
warm water, and work it smooth and to a good consistency. 
Put a paste round the inside, but not to the bottom of the 
dish ; and let the cover be pretty thick, to bear the long 
continuance in the oven. 

For rich Pie-crust. — Weigh an equal quantity of butter 
with as much fine flour as you judge necessary : mix, witli 
a silver spoon, a little of the former with the latter, and wet it 
Mith as little water as will make it into a stiff paste. Roll 
it out, and put all the butter over it in slices, turn in the ends, 
and roll it thin ; do this tmce, and handle it as little as possible. 
The butter may be added at twice ; and for those who are not 
accustomed to make paste it may be i)etter to do so. 

It requires a quicker oven than for short crust. Lay a paper 
over to keep it from scorching. 

A less rich Paste. — Weigh 1 lb. of flour and j lb. of butter, 
rub them together, and mix into a paste with a little water and 
an e^^ well beaten. Roll and fold it 3 or 4 times ; or, omit 
the e^^, and put 6 oz. of butter and a spoonful of white sugar ; 
work up the whole into a stiff paste with as little hot water as 
possible. 

PUFF PASTE, 

535. — To obtain this in perfection much will depend on the 
quality of the butter vised, and on its being rolled out or turned 
a sufficient number of times, so that the butter may be mixed 
with the paste in minute layers. Salt butter will make as 
good, if not better, paste than fresh. When salt butter is used, 
it should be broken into small pieces, and put into a pan o" 
pail of clean cold water ; well work or squeeze it between the 
hands in the water, which will deprive it of the greatest portion 
of the salt it contains ; take it from the water and put it on a 
cloth, and mould or work it well, in the same manner as you 
would a piece of paste ; when the water is all worked out, and 
the butter appears dry and firm, make it in a roll and put it in 
a cold place for use. Fresh butter should be moulded in the 
same manner as directed for salt, but it does not require being 
larst put into water. In summer a few pieces of ice may be 



Ckaf. XXIT. paste. 389 

put into the water with the Gutter, in order to harden it. But 
in winter or severe frosty weather the butter should be well 
moulded, in order to make it mellow. 

Weigh 1 lb. of butter and 1 lb. of sifted flour. Take 2 oz. 
of the butter and rub in with the flour ; make a hole in the 
middle, in vvhich put a teaspoonful of salt, and pour in suffi- 
cient cold ^vater to make it into a paste of nearly the samt; 
consistency as the butter. This should be more particularly 
observed in summer, as the heat then causes the butter to 
become very soft during- the rolling of the paste, and to break 
through the surface, unless the dough is made of considerably 
less consistency in the first place, in order to allow for this. 
To each pound allow 2 eggs, well beaten and mixed with the 
water. 

Mix the dough into a clear, smooth paste, without tough- 
ness, by rubbing it well with the heel of the right hand on 
the board until it has acquired a clear, smooth, shining appear- 
ance ; mould it into a round lump, then press all the moisture 
from the remainder of the butter, and form it into a ball, 
taking care not to soften it : put this upon the paste and pre^s 
it down, then enclose it Avith the paste like an apple-dumpling ; 
flour the marble well and roll it out ; this is called the " first 
turn ;" then fold it in three, and roll it out again, which will" 
be a second turn ; now fold it again in the same manner, and 
put it in a cold place, if convenient on ice,"" covered with a 
damp cloth, until it is required to be rolled out for use, when 
the number of turns required to be given to it more will 
depend on the thinness it has been rolled each time ; thus, if 
it is rolled out to the greatest extent it will reach, 4 turns 
will be generally sufl[icient for it. If rolled out thicker than 
this, or about i inch or ratlier more in thickness, it will then 
require from 4i to 6 turns, but not more than 6^ in any case. 
The half-turn is merely doubling the sheet or folding it in 
two. Experience alone can determine when the paste has 
been sufficiently rolled.

536.— Mix the flour and water together, roll the paste out, 
and lay bits of butter upon it. Then beat up the white of asi 

If ice is not to be had, and the butter is soft, put it into a basin, and set 
the basin in a pan of water mixed with plenty of salt and saltpetre, and let ii

egg, and brush it all over the paste before it is folded ; repeat 
this when rolling out, and adding the butter each time till 
the whole of the white of egg is used. It will make the paste 
very flaky. 

JFor Tarts and Cheesecakes. — Beat the white of an egg to 
a strong froth ; then mix it M'ith as much water as will make 
•I lb. of fine flour into a very stiff* paste : roll it very thin, 
then lay the third part of ^ lb. of butter upon it in little bits ; 
dredge it with some flour left out at first, and roll it up tight. 
Roll it out again, and put the same proportion of butter ; and 
so proceed till all be worked up. 

I^or Orange Cheesecakes or Sweetmeats. — Dry 1 lb. of the 
finest flour, mix with it 3 oz. of refined sugar ; then work 
\ lb. of butter with your hand till it comes to a froth ; put 
the flour into it by degrees, and work into it, well beaten and 
strained, the yolks of 3 and whites of 2 eggs. If too soft, 
put some flour and sugar, to make it fit to roll. Line your 
pattypans, and fill. A little above 15 minutes will bake them. 
Against they come out, have ready some refined sugar beaten 
up with the Avhite of an e'gg as thick as you can ; ice them all 
over, set them in llie oven to harden, and serve cold. Use 
fresh butter. 

TRANSPARENT CRUST FOR TARTS. 
537. — Beat an egg till it be quite thin ; have ready 12 oz. 
of the purest well-washed butter, without salt, melted without 
being oiled ; and when cool mix the egg with it, and stir it 
into 1 lb. of fine flour well dried. Make the paste very tldn ; 
line the pattypans as quickly as you can, and, when putting 
the tarts into the oven, brush them over with v/ater, and sift 
sugar on them. If they are baked in a lightly heated oven, 
they will look beautiful. 

SHORT CRUST. 

538. — Mix 2 oz. of white powdered sugar with 1 lb. of flour, 
and rub into it 3 oz. of butter so completely as not to allow 
any separate bits to be seen ; beat the yolks of 2 eggs into 
some cream, and make the whole into a smooth paste ; roll 
it thin. 

Or : — Mix 2 oz. of powdered sugar ^vith 1 lb. of flour ; add 
h lb. of butter rubbed into it very fine ; make it into a jiaste 
with cold water ; roll it out and use it. 



Chap. XXII. PASTE. 391 

Or : — Mix with 1 lb. of fine flour dried, 1 oz. of sugar 
pounded and sifted ; then rub 3 oz. of butter in it, till it 
looks all like flour, and, with a gill of boiling cream, work it 
up to a fine paste. 

Another, not sweet hut rich. — Rub 6 oz. of butter in 8 oz. 
of fine flour ; mix it into a stiffish paste, with as little water 
as possible ; beat it well and roll it thin. Bake them all in a 
moderate oven. 

CROQ UANT PAS TE FOR C VERING PRESER VES. 
539. — Dissolve a drachm of sugar in as much cold water 
as will make 4 oz. of flour into a paste : knead and beat it as 
smooth as possible. Roll it to the size of tlie croquant form, 
and about i inch thick. Rub the form with beef-suet, and lay 
it on the paste, and press it so closely as to cut the pattern 
completely through. Then lay it on a tin to bake. With a 
bunch of white feathers do over the paste with the white of an 
egg beaten, and sift fine sugar on it. Bake it in a slow oven, 
and gently remove the paste from the tin while yet warm, and 
lay it over the fruit it is to cover. The same cover wil] serve 
many times if kept in a dry place. 

BRIOCHE PASTE.— E. R. 
540. — This paste is essential in many of the finer kinds of 
cookery, and, though rather troublesome to make, will repay 
the pains bestowed, since, with a small addition of sauce, it 
will afford an excellent side-dish in itself, and H will enter 
into the composition of, and improve, all the more elaborate 
entrees. Take 7 fresh eggs, 2 lbs. of flour dried and warmed 
at the fire, and 1 lb. of fresh butter. Take i lb. of this flour, 
and pour into the middle of it a dessertspoonful of yeast, which 
has been prepared by pouring water over it, stirring it, and 
allowing it to stand to settle, and tlien draining the ■v\'ater off". 
It is the sediment which must be employed. Pour a little 
v/arm water over the yeast, and mix the paste up v/ith it, which 
forms the leaven ; flour the pan, lay the leaven in it before 
the fire to rise, and slit it on the top. As soon as the pf:ste 
has risen proceed thus : — Make a hole in the middle of the 
remaining flour, put into it a little salt, about a saltspoonful, 
the same quantity of powdered sugar to take off any bitter 
taste in the yeast, and a little water to melt it; the butter 
broken into small pieces, and the eggs : work it all well 



392 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXII. 

together, and knead it tlioroug-hly, spreading it out and work- 
ing it well : then spread it out entirely, and lay the yeast or 
leavened paste all over it. takinsr the greatest care in kneading 
and shiftins: the paste about to mix both well together. It 
Avill take some time, and must be done thoroughly. Then 
flour a towel, wrap the paste up in it, and put it into a pan ; if 
in cold weather in a warm situation, and if in hot weather in a 
cold one. It is best made a day before it is wanted. Very 
minute pieces, shaped in any way, add greatly to the excel- 
lence of soup, to be boiled with it, or stewed in the gravy of a 
vol-au-vent . and strewed over the top. It is cut into shapes 
also, and fiied as the accompaniment of braised dishes of every 
kind- It is an exquisite case for lobster and other patties, or, 
brushed over with e^^. m^y be fried in shapes for a side-dish : 
or it may be boiled in cups, 6 in a dish, and served up ^"ith 
asparagus cut small and heaped upon the top, and a white 
sauce round. In fact, a clever cook, by employing different 
flavourinGT in27*edients, either sweet or savoury, may make 
endless dishes of brioche. It should not. however, predomi- 
nate ; and therefore it is best to make only a small quantity 
at a time, where the consumption of the family is not great. 
It icill not heep long. The proper length of time for baking" 
can only be learned by practice and attention on the part of 
the cook ; much depending on the state of the oven, as well 
as the size of the article to be cooked : its appearance will, 
liowever. be generally found a pretty safe guide. 



ilEAT PIES, PATTIES, &c. 

541. — There are few articles of cookery more generally 
liked than relishing pie^^ if properly made ; and they may be 
formed of a great variety of things. 

Raised Pies may be made of any kind of flesh, fish, fruit, Oi 
poultry, if baked in a wall of paste instead of a baking-dish ; 
but they are generally eaten cold, and made so large and 
savoury as to remain a long time before being consumed, for 
which reason they abo bear the name of '• standing pies." In 
making them the cook should always take care to have a good 
stock that will jelly, made from the bones and trimmings, to 
fill up the pie when it comes from the oven, and also thai when 



v^HAP. XXn. MEAT PIES. 393 

cold there may be enough jelly. For want of this precaution 
pies become dry before they can be eaten. The materials are 
of course frequently varied, but the mode of preparation is so 
nearly the same as not to require the recital of more than a 
few prominent receipts. 

SEASOXIXG FOR RAISED PIES. 

542. — 3 lbs. of salt dried and pounded. 3 oz. of white p-epper, 
h oz. of cayenne pepper, 2 oz. of cloveSj 2 oz, of allspice, 1 oz. 
of basil, 1 oz. of marjoram, 1 oz. of thyme* 1 oz. of bay-leaf, 
1 oz. of nutmeg, 1^ oz. of mace. 

Pound the spices and herbs by themselves, ^id sift through 
a fine sieve ; then mix with the salt, and put away in a stop- 
pered bottle : 7 oz. is suuicient for 1 lb. of farce, and ^ oz. for 
1 lb. of boned game. 

JELLY FOR 31 EAT OR RAISED PIES. 
543. — Take a quart of veal gravy, dissolve 2 oz. of isinglas-; 
in a little of it ; add the remainder with i pint of tarragon 
^-ine3:a^ ; boil all tos^ether for i of an hour. Clarify it witli 
the whites of 6 eggs, then pass it through a bag. 

PATE DE GIBIER AUX TRUFFES. 

544. — ^Make a farce of 2 lbs. of lean meat, either rabbit, 
veal, or pork ; 1 lb. of liver, either calf s or game ; \ lb. of 
lean ham ; 3 lbs. of bacon fat ; 4 oz. of seasoning spice. 

Cut up the above ingredients ; put them in a ste^vpan with 
a shalot and a tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; let it heat 
gently on the fire, stirring occasionally ; when the meat is 
tolerably done, turn the whole into a mortar, and pound it 
thoroughly ; take it out, and mix with it H lb. of truffles 
chopped. 

Bone a hare and 4 partridges ; season them in the proportion 
of T oz. of seasoning spice to each pound of meat : put a little 
of the farce in the partridges, together with a large French 
truffle (French are preferred to the English on account of their 
colour and flavour — the English answer the purpose, and are 
not more than ith the expense). 

Line a French pie-mould, as directed at *• Pastry." being 
careful to make the join in the paste perfect ; put a layer of 
thin bacon fat at the bottom, then a layer of the farce, and on 
that one of the hare -, then the partridsres. two breast upwards 

3 3 



394 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXII 

and the other two reversed ; fill up the pie with the remainder 
of the farce and hare ; shape the top nicely, put a slice of 
l)acon fat over and two bay-leaves ; cover with paste, and bake 
for 4 hours ; when nearly cold, fill in with the gravy drawn 
from the bones, and set with a little isinglass. 

PARTRIDGE PIE A LA FRANCAISE. 

545. — "Take 6 partridges, trussed as for boiled chickena, 
and season them well. Take also 2 lbs. of veal and 1 lb. of 
fat bacon ; cut these into small bits, and put them into a stew- 
pan with -J lb. of butter, together with some shalots, parsley, 
and thyme, stewing them until quite tender. Strain and pound 
the meat in a mortar till made perfectly smooth. 

" The pie-crust being raised, put in the partridges with the 
above-mentioned forcemeat over them, and over that lay some 
thin slices of bacon. Cover the pie with a thick lid, and be 
sure to close it well, to prevent any portion of the gravy from 
oozing out. 

" This sized pie will require 3 hours' baking, but care must 
be taken not to put it into the oven till the fierce heat be 
gone off." ^ 

For Partridge-pie iii the ordinary ivay lay a veal cutlet in 
the bottom of the dish ; line the inside of the birds with fat 
bacon, season them well and place them with the breast down- 
wards ; fill the dish with good gravy, and add forcemeat-balls, 
with a few button mushrooms freshly gathered. 

Pies of this sort may be made nearly in the same manner of 
every species of game ; but the mixture of the brov/n and 
^vhite meats is not desirable, as the former have a peculiar 
flavour which ought to be maintained, and is weakened by the 
admixture of the latter : also hare and venison, though each 
forming admirable pasties separately, yet spoil each other when 
put together. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

546. — Cut up 2 young fowls, season with white pepper, salt, 
a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder. Put the 
chicken, thin slices of ham or fresh gammon of bacon, force- 
meat, and hard eggs, by turns in layers. By tlie time it 
returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of knuckle of veal, 
or a bit of the scrag, with some shank-bones of mutton, or a 

* Dr. Hunter's ' Medical Commentary on iModeru Cookery,' p. 160 



CiiAP. XXII. MEAT TIES. 3Do 

calf s-foot, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and white pepper ; 
and if it be made in a dish, put as much gravy as will fill it. 
but in a raised crust the gravy must be nicely strained, and 
then put in cold as jelly. To make the jelly clear, take oil 
the fat, whip up 2 wliites of eggs, give it a boil, and then run 
it through a fine lawn sieve. 

Or : — Lay a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, 
seasoned, into a dish ; scald a large handful of picked jjarslci/ 
in milk, season it, and add it to the fowl or meat, with a tea- 
cupful of any sort of good broth or weak gravy. When it is 
baked, raise the crust and pour into the dish j pint of cream 
scalded, with a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and a bit 
of flour; stirring it round to mix with the gravy already in. 
It is very excellent when made with alternate layers of salt 
pork, or slices of pig's-cheek. 

BABBIT FIE, 

547. — Rabbits^ if young and in flesh, are quite as delicate 
as chickens : their legs should be cut short, and the ribs must 
not be put in, but will help to make the gravy. 

Cut 2 rabbits and 1 lb. of pickled pork into small bits ; lay 
them, when seasoned with pepper and salt, into a dish. Parboil 
the livers, and beat them in a mortar, with their weight of fat 
bacon, some pepper, salt, mace, and sweet herbs, chopped fine. 
JMake this into small balls, and distribute in the dish. Grate ^ a 
small nutmeg over, and add a pint of gravy. Cover -with a 
tolerably thick crust, and bake it an hour in a quick but not 
violently heated oven. 

All pies made of white meats or fowls are improved by a 
layer of fine sausage-meat, made of pork, flavoured according 
to taste and the savouriness of the pie. 

HARE PIE. 

548. — Season the hare after it is cut up, in the same manner 
as if to be jugged ; and bake it, with eggs, and forcemeat 
partly made of the liver, in a raised crust or dish. When it 
is to be served, raise the lid, and, if in a crust, cover it with 
jelly, but, if made in a dish, with warm gravy, mixed with a 
large glassful of port wine. 

TIP PER AR Y CURB Y (an excellent Picnic Dish). 
549. — Boil 4 chickens, and stiifl'2 cf them when cold with 
a. foi'cemeat made of crumbs of bread, a fe^\ slices of ham or 



396 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIL 

tongue, sweet herbs, and a shalot well j^ounded and mixed 
with the yolk of an egg. Stuff the other 2 with boiled rice, 
lay them in a mould or dish, with 8 hard-boiled eggs cut in 
half, a few mushrooms, a little pickled lemon cut in thin rings. 
Pour over the chickens a gravy made as follows: — Fry an 
onion in a little butter, add a tablespoonful of curry-powder, 
1 of vinegar, 1 of mushroom-ketchup, a little salt, and a little 
more than a pint of good veal broth ; if the broth does not 
jelly, isinglass must be put into it to make it do so. When 
cold turn it out on a dish. It is a great improvement to bone 
the chickens, the bones helping to make the gravy. 

FRENCH PIE. 

550. — Make a raised crust upon a buttered tin, and brush 
it with yolk of egg ; cover the bottom with forcemeat, then 
fill up the pie with sweetbread cut into small pieces, oysters, 
limbs of chicken, turkey, or rabbit, boned ; artichoke-bottoms 
in small pieces, asparagus-tops, forcem^eat-balls, and mushrooms, 
taking care to lay them regularly, and to season the whole 
lightly and evenly : bake it in a moderate oven. When it is 
done pour in some good white sauce. 

Sausage-meat may be mixed v»'ith the forcemeat, and in 
winter trufRes substituted for the vegetables; the seasoning 
should be of mace, cloves, and cayenne pepper. 

VEGETABLE PIE. 

551 . — Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young carrots, 
turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, onions, lettuces, parsley, 
celery, and add peas ; or use any of them you may have. Make 
tliem into a nice stew, with a little good veal gravy ; season ' 
Mdth pepper and salt ; bake a crust over a dish, with a little 
li-ning round the edge. When baked, pour the stew into the 
dish, and lay the crust over it. Winter vegetables may be 
used in the same way ; a cup of cream is a great improvement. 

COLD PIES. 

552. — When meat pies are prepared to be cafe?i cold, suet 
should not be put into the forcemeat that is used with them. 
If the pie is made of meat that will take more dressing, to 
make it extremely tender, than the baking of the crust Vv ill 
allow, prepare it in the following way : — Take 3 lbs. of the 
veiny piece of beef that has fat and lean ; wash it, and season 



Chap. XXII. MEAT PIES. 397 



it with salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rubbing 
them well in. Set it by the side of a slow fire, in a stewpot 
that will just hold it ; put to it 2 oz. of butter, and cover it 
quite close ; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins 
to shrink. When it is cold, add more seasoning, forcemeat, 
and eggs : if it is made in a dish, put some gravy to it before 
baking ; but if it is only in crust, do not put the gravy till 
after it is cold and in jelly. Forcemeat may be put both under 
and over the meat, if preferred to balls. 

VEAL PIES.—E. B. 

553. — The best part of veal for this purpose is the breast ; 
cut it into pieces and put it into a stewpan, with an onion, a 
head of celery, a bundle of sweet herbs, and a small quantity 
of water ; when warmed through add more Mater, and stew it 
gently until it is done. By this means 2 lbs. of veal will 
yield a quart of fine white stock, which will jelly : let it remain 
until cold, and then take off all the fat ; take out the long 
bones, and all the skin, season it well, and p"le it lightly in th^^ 
pie-dish, having lined the sides with paste. Boil 4 or 6 eggs 
hard, and put them in : pound some ham or gammon of bacon 
in a mortar — bacon or ham in slices always being hard — make 
them up into small balls with a little butter, and add them ; 
add also some forcemeat-balls ; fill up the pie with the stock, 
which should be flavoured with a small quantity of ketchup, 
Chetney, or other sauce. 

Reserve a portion of the stock thus prepared, and pour it 
hot into the pie, when it comes from the oven, to supply the 
waste. This will be most excellent cold, as it will be perfectly 
free from all greasy particles, and the meat tender, which will 
not be the case unless pre\iously stewed. 

I^or Cold Veal Pie. — Take some of the fleshy part of a 
knuckle of veal, with an equal quantity of minced ham ; season 
it witli salt, pepper, spices, and aromatic herbs chopped, and a 
small clove of garlic or shalot ; pound them in a mortar, adding 
eggs and an equal quantity of gravy. Cover the bottom of a 
pan with thin slices of bacon ; lay a little of this forcemeat upon 
it ; lay some cutlets of veal over the forcemeat, seasoning them 
with pepper and minced mushrooms : in this manner fill to the 
top, covering the whole with forcemeat.

paper, sprinkling a little flour on the paste ; then take the 
meat from the pan, which should be plunged in hot water to 
detach it easily ; place it in the paste, covering it at the to)) 
Avith a crust ^ inch thick, and leaving a hole in the middle. 
Glaze, and put it into a very hot oven ; let it bake 3 or 4 
hours ; when sufficiently done, a wooden skewer will enter 
easily. Put in some clear gravy ; fasten the hole at the to}), 
and turn it upside down. 

This pie may be made of fowl, rabbit, or game, boned or 
put in whole, the birds being filled with forcemeat, mushrooms, 
either fresh or buttons pickled, or black truffles. 

Veal and Sweetbread Pie. — Cut the veal from the chump 
end of the loin ; season it well ; clean and blanch a sweet- 
bread, cut it into pieces, and season it; lay both in the dish 
\At\\ the yolks of 6 hard-boiled eggs and a pint of oysters. 
Strain the oyster liquor, add to it a pint of good gravy ; line 
the sides of the dish with a puff paste h inch thick, and 
cover it with a lid of the same. Bake it in a qnick oven for 
1 \ hour ; and when it is sent to table cut the lid into 8 or 10 
pieces, and stick them round the sides, covering the meat with 
slices of lemon. 

Veal and Sausage Pie. — Cover a shallow dish with paste, 
lay a well-beaten veal-cutlet at the bottom, slightly seasoned ; 
cover it with a Bolosrna sausasre freed from the skin and cut 
into slices ; then add another cutlet and a layer of the Bo- 
logna sausage ; cover the whole with paste, and put no water to 
it: the veal will give out sufficient gravy, while it will be 
rendered very savoury by the sausage. It is excellent eaten 
cold. 

Veal and Oyster Pie. — IMake a seasoning of pepper, salt, 
and a small quantity of grated lemon-peel. Cut some veal- 
cutlets, and beat them until they are tender : spread over 
them a layer of pounded ham, and roll them round ; then 
cover them with oysters, and put another layer of the veal 
fillets, and oysters on the top. Make a gravy of the bones 
and trimmings, or with a lump of butter, onion, a little flour, 
and water ; stew the oyster liquor, and put to it, and fill up 
the dish, reserving a portion to put into the pie when it comes 
fiom the oven. 

Veal and Pork Pie. — ^Take equal quantities of veal and 
pork, boil 1 or 2 onions, and scald some leaves of sage : beat 



CuAr. XXI r. MEAT PIES. 399 

the meat well, and cover it with the sage and onions chopped 
together, M'ith pepper and salt ; fill up the pie with a little 
gravy, and bake it. 

EXCELLENT PORK PIES TO EAT COLD. 

554. — Eaise the crust according to the directions already 
given, into either a round or oval form, as you choose ; have 
ready the trimmings and small bits of pork cut off when a hog 
is killed ; and if these are not enough, take the meat off a 
blade-bone. Beat it well with a rolling-pin, cut it into dice, 
season with pepper and salt, and keep the fat and lean separate. 
Put it in layers, quite close up to the top ; lay on the lid ; 
cut the edge smooth round, and pinch it ; bake in a slow 
soaking oven, as the meat is very solid. The pork may be put 
into a common dish, with a very plain crust, and be quite as 
good. Observe to put no bone or water into pork pie : the 
outside of the pieces will be hard, unless they are cut small 
and pressed close. 

Both these and veal and chicken pies are generally eaten 
cold, and, as they are always seasoned highly, will keep good 
for several days in the hottest weather. In the west of 
England it is not uncommon to take off the cover and fill tJie 
pie up, M'he.n cold, with clouted cream, which is a very deli- 
cious addition. 

CALF'S-HEAD OR CALF'S-FOOTPIE.—E.R. 
555. — Either must be well stewed before being put into 
the pie. They must be cut into nice pieces, free from bone, 
and well seasoned, or otherwise they will be tasteless. If to 
be eaten hot, sausage-meat or fresh mushrooms or oysters will 
be an improvement, in addition to the ham, eggs, and force- 
meat-balls ; and if cold, the small pickled mushrooms should 
be added, or a little mushroom powder in the gravy. The 
excellence of the pie will chiefly depend upon the seasoning 
and flavour, and the quantity of fine savoury jelly which it will 
contain ; and therefore the meat should not be closely packed, 
in order to leave room for the jelly. 

Calfs-foot and Kidney Pie. — Take from a cold roasted 
loin of veal slices of the kidney fat, cover them ^vith pounded 
ham, and put them into a dish with the kidney cut into pieces, 
and the meat from a calf s foot ; put in a few hard-boiled eggs 
and forcemeat-balls, made very savoury with oysters, an 



400 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXII 

anchov}', and the fat of bacon, as this pie should be eaten 
cold. Put the juice of ^^ a lemon, or a spoonful of Harvey 
sauce, into the gravy. Sweetbread may be used instead of 
kidney. 

BEEF-STEAK PIE. 

556. — Take rump-steaks that have been well hung, cut in 
small scallops ; beat them gently with a rolling-pin ; season 
with pepper, salt, and a little shalot minced very fine ; put in 
a layer of sliced potatoes, place the slices in layers with a good 
piece of fat and a sliced mutton kidney ; fill the dish ; put 
some crust on the edge, and about an inch below it, and a cup 
of water or broth in the dish. Cover with rather a thick crust, 
and set in a moderate oven. 

Beefsteak and Oyster Pie. — Prepare the steaks as above, 
and put layers of them and of oysters. Heat the liquor and 
beards of the latter with a bit of lemon-peel, mace, and a 
tablespoonful of walnut ketchup. When the pie is baked, 
boil with the above 3 spoonfuls of cream and 1 oz. of butter 
rubbed in flour; to which^ however, many people object as 
injuring the savouriness of the pie ; in which case, should any 
addition ,be required, a few spoonfuls of beef gravy and port 
wine will answer the purpose. Strain it, and pour it into the 
dish : for a small pie a dozen of Milton oysters will be suffi- 
cient, and the pie may be baked in a couple of hours. 

3IUTT0N PIE.—E. R. 

557. — Cut the mutton into small slices, without bone ; 
season it very well, and stew it with the fat also cut in pieces, 
putting in no water. "When tender allow it to remain until 
cold ; remove all the grease and fat very carefully ; have 
some gravy made from the bones, add to it the strained gravy 
from the mutton, and a glass of port Mdne, but the wine may 
be omitted if the gravy be strong and highly seasoned. A 
minced shalot and button onions are good additions, and if 
the latter be pickled their acidity will be an improvement. 
Put it into a dish or into small pattypans, and bake it ; if in 
pattypans use puflT paste. Mutton pies are better hot than 
cold. 

The underdone part of a leg of mutton may be thus dressed ; 
but the loin and kidneys are better suited for the purpose. 
Lamb Pfe.— Make it of the loin, neck, or breast j the

breast of house-lamh is one of the most delicate things that 
can be eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pepper 
ivnd salt, the bone taken out, but not the gristles ; cover it 
with puff paste, and put in a small quantity of jelly-gravy hot. 

SQUAB PIE 

558. — Is a favourite dish throughout Devonshire and Corn- 
wall, and is there generally made of mutton. It is made thus : 
Cut apples as for other pies, and lay them in rows with mutton 
chops and shred onion ; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and also 
some sugar. Bake the pie in a deep dish, cover it with a thick 
crust, and eat it hot ; it must be well done, and will take 2 to 
3 hours baking. In the midland counties it is usually made 
of beef cut into dice, with some lean bacon seasoned and mixed 
with the apples. 

POTATO PIE. 
559. — IIa,ve a tin dish (as in the cut), take out the plate, 

lay pieces of meat at the bottom 
of the dish, seasoned with pepper 
and salt, and a little water. Re- 
place the plate, which is perfo- 
rated with holes, fill up the disli 
to the handles of the centre pillar 
with mashed potatoes ; bake it ; 
wlien put on table, lift up the 
plate of potatoes, wliich will have 
received all the flavour of the 
Potato-pie Dish. baked meat. 

VENISON PASTY. 

560. — The neck, breast, and shoulder are the only parts of 
the deer used in this country for a pasty ; and even the neck 
is more generally roasted. 

A shoulder and breast, boned, make a good pasty; but, the 
shoulder being sinewy, it will be of advantage to rub it weL 
with sugar for 2 or 3 days ; and when used wipe it perfectly 
clean. A mistake used to prevail that venison could not be 
baked too much ; but 3 or 4 hours in a slow oven will be 
sufficient to make it tender, and the flavour will be preserved. 

Cut the venison in pieces ; put it into a stewpan with a 
little port wine, 2 shalots, an onion, bay-leaf, faggot of parsley 
and thyme, pepper, salt, and a little gravy. Cover it close 




402 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXII. 

and let it stew gently until tender ; take out the meat, and 
pull out the bones ; reduce the gravy, and when thoroughly 
cold remove the fat ; then proceed to make the pasty. 

Line the sides of the dish with crust, but not the bottom ; 
lay in the meat with fat between each piece, season with 
pepper and salt, put to it a pint of the gravy and a few bits of 
butter, cover with a good crust, and bake it thoroughly. 

Keep the remainder of the gravy till the pasty comes from 
the oven, put it by means of a funnel into the middle quite hot, 
and shake the dish to mix it well. The pasty must be well 
done, requiring generally 2 hours' baking. 

A want of fat may be supplied by the fat of a loin of muttoii 
steeped for 24 hours in port wine and garlic vinegar. 

To make a Pasty of JBeef or Mutton to eat like Venison. — 
Bone a small rump or piece of sirloin of beef, or a fat loin of 
mutton, after hanging several days. Beat it very well with a 
rolling-pin ; then rub 10 lbs. of meat with 4 oz. of sugar, and 
pour over it a pint of port, and the same of vinegar. Let it lie 
o days and nights ; wash and wipe the meat very dry, and 
season it very high with pepper, allspice, nutmeg, and salt. 
Lay it in the dish, and to 10 lbs. put f lb. of butter ; spread it 
over the meat. Put a crust round the edges and cover with a 
thick one, or it will be overdone before the meat be soaked : 
it must be done in a slow oven. 

Set the bones in a pan in the oven, with no more water 
than will cover them, and 1 glass of port, a little pepper and 
salt, that you may have a little rich gravy to add to the 
pasty when dravv^n. 

YORKSHIRE GOOSE FIE.— E. R. 
661. — ^Bone a goose, a fowl, and a pigeon ; season them 
well with pepper, taking care to cover the whole of tne inte- 
rior, or otherwise it will turn sour before it can be eaten ; put 
the pigeon into the fowl, and the fowl inside the goose, filling 
the interstices with various kinds of force and sausage meat 
and hard-boiled eggs. The liver and gizzard of the fowl and 
pigeon will assist in the forcemeat, which must be very well 
CO mpounded ; sew up the goose, and put it into a thick crust. 
It will take several hours to bake. Make savoury jelly, which 
must also be well seasoned, pour it into the pie when it comes 
from the oven ; ornament the top, and let it be moveable, so 
that the pie may have a good appearance to the last, as the 



Chap. XXII. MEAT PIES. 403 

crust is not to be eaten. A calf s-foot, boned and cut small, 
may be added, especially if used for the jelly. 

Green Goose Pie, — Bone 2 young green ^eQi^Q, of a good 
size ; but. first take away every plug, and singe them nicely. 
"Wash them clean ; and season them high with salt, pepper, 
mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other, and press them 
as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put a good 
deal of butter over them, and bake them either with or without 
crust ; if the latter, a cover to the dish must fit close to keep 
in the steam. It will keep long. Gravy-jelly may be added 
when the pie is to be served. 

GIBLET PIE. 
562. — After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, 
stew them with a small quantity of water or well-seasoned 
gravy, onion, black pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs, till 
nearly done. Let them grow cold ; and if not enough to fill 
the dish, lay a steak of beef or veal, or 2 or 3 mutton steaks, 
at the bottom ; it requires 2 sets of giblets to make a moderate 
.sized pie. Add the gravy. 

A CHRISTMAS PIE. 

563. — Bone a large goose and a fowl. Parboil a smoked 
tongue ; peel it and cut off the root. Mix togetlier a powdered 
nutmeg, i oz. of powdered mace, a teaspoonful of pepper, the 
same quantity of salt, and season the fowl and goose. 

Roll out the paste near an inch thick, and divide it into 3 
pieces ; cut out 2 of them in an oval form for the top and 
bottom ; and the other into a long straight piece for the sides 
or walls of the pie. Brush the paste all over with beaten 
white of e^^, and set on the bottom the piece that is to form 
the wall, pinching the edges together, and cementhig them 
with white of eg^. The bottom piece must be large enough 
to turn up a little round the lower edge of the wall piece, tc 
which it must be firmly joined all round. When you have 
the crust properly fixed, so as to be baked standing alone 
without a dish, put in first the goose, then the fowl, then the 
tongue. Fill up what space is left with pieces of the flesh of 
pigeons, or of partridges, quails, or any game that is conve- 
nient. There must be no bones in the pie. You may add 
also some bits of ham, or some forcemeat-balls. Cover the 
mgi-edients with ^ lb. of butter, and put on the top criLstj 



404 ^rODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXU 

which, of course, must be also of an oval form to correspond 
with the bottom. The lid must be placed not quite on the top 
edge of the wall, but H inch below it ; close it very well, and 
ornament the sides and top with festoons and leaves cut out oi 
paste; notch the edges handsomely, and put a paste flower in 
the centre ; glaze the whole with beaten yolk of egg, and bind 
the pie all round with a double fold of white paper; bake 
it 4 liours. 

If the w^eatRer is cold, and the pie kept carefully covered 
up from the air, it will be good for 2 or 3 weeks, the standing 
crust assisting to preserve it. 

PIGEON FIE. 

564. — Have a nice rump-steak, cut it in thin slices, cover 
the bottom of the dish with it, then put a little seasoning, 
parsley, and shalot over it ; boil 2 eggs hard, chop the livers 
fine together with a little shalot and parsley ; add a few bread- 
crumbs, pepper, salt, and a small lump of butter ; work all up 
together, and fill the pigeons with it ; put in the pigeons, then 
a little more seasoning, fill up the dish with steak, seasoning 
it as before ; put in some water or gravy, cover Avith pufi- 
paste, cut some leaves and lay over, egg it, and bake it. 

PA TTIES. 

565. — Roll out puff paste i inch thick, and, wdth a 2-inch 
round cutter, cut as many pieces as are required for the dish. 
Take an inch cutter, dip it in hot water, and press it in ihe 
middle of the paste about half through. Brush the ]>ieces 
over with yolk of egg, bake in a quick oven, take out the 
piece marked with the inch cutter, remove the soft parts from 
the inside, fill them with a mince of any kind, dish them on a 
napkin, garnish with fried parsley. To make the tops, roll 
out the trimmings thin, cut some pieces with the inch cutter, 
egg them over, and bake them. 

Of Beef. — Shred underdone dressed beef with a little fal, 
season with pepper, salt, and a little shalot or onion. Add 
gravy, ^ a glass of Madeira, and a few bread-crumbs. When 
hot, fill the patty-cases. 

Of Veal. — Mince some ^eal that is not quite done, put to it 
a little parsley, lemon-peel, nutmeg, and salt ;• a little cream 
ajul gravy just to moisten the meat ; if you have any ham, it 



Chap. XX 11 PATTIES. 405 

will be an improvement. Do not warm it till the patties are 
baked. 

Of Turkey. — Mince some of the white part ; and with 
grated lemon, nutmeg-, salt, a very little white pepper, cream, 
and a very little bit of butter warmed, fill the patties. 

A good Mince for Patties. — 2 oz. of ham, 4 of chicken or 
veal, 1 egg boiled hard, 3 cloves, a blade of mace, pepper and 
salt, in fine powder. Just before you serve, warm the above 
with 4 spoonfuls of rich gravy, the same of cream, and 1 oz. 
of butter. Fill as usual. 

Of Oyster. — Take off the beards of the oysters, cut the 
other parts in small bits, put them in a small tosser with i 
grate of nutmeg, a little white pepper and salt, a morsel of 
lemon-peel cut very small, a little cream, and a small quantity 
of the oyster liquor. Simmer a few minutes before you fill. 

Or : — Beard and chop the oysters, boil a little cream, with 
an onion and a small quantity of mace ; chop fine the crust of 
a French roll, mix it with the oysters, add the cream ; let it 
boil. Season with nutmeg, cayenne, and salt. 

Of Lobster. — Mince the fish in the same manner, mingling 
with it a little of the coral, and make with the same seasoning, 
a little cream, and the smallest bit of butter. 

Of Shrimps. — Pick a quart of shrimps ; if they are very 
salt, season them with only mace and a clove or two. Mince 
2 or 3 anchovies ; mix these with the spice, and then season 
the shrimps. Put a glass of sharp white wine. They do not 
take long baking. 

VOL- A U- VENT.—E. R. 

566. — Take puff paste, roll it about f inch thick, cut it 
round or oval according to the shape of the dish ; make the 
knife hot in water, so as not to drag the paste in cutting it ; 
mark the cover an inch from the edge, brush it over M'i'th yolk 
of e^^ ; bake it in a quick oven ; when done take off the top, 
clean out the soft paste, return it to the oven for a few minutes 
to dry ; dish it on a napkin. 

Care must be taken in taking out the soft part not to break 
the outside. 

It may be filled with ragout of sweetbread, fricassee of 
chicken, quenelles, lobster, or oysters, but is never made of a 
large size. 



406 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXII. 

Of Croquettes. — Make croquettes of the size of a jDigeon^s 
*ig^, of veal and ham and of calves' brains, an equal quantity 
of each, fry them of the palest gold colour, make a rich white- 
sauce, and put into it the very smallest mushrooms or minced 
truffles : give it an acid flavour with lemon or lemon-pickle, 
and put it in>o the vol-au-vent wlien it is to be sent to table. 

Of Veal. — Cut veal into thin pieces the size of half-a-crown, 
beat them, and fry them a pale brown ; make some forcemeat 
and e^^ balls, fry the former, put the whole into a rich brown 
gravy, fill the vol-au-vent, and serve it up hot. 

Of Pigeons and Sweetbreads. — Cut off the pinions, legs, 
and backs of 3 or 4 pigeons, and bone the breast, making it 
as large as possible : cut 3 or 4 pieces of blanched sweetbread 
the same size, put them together, securing them with tape, 
and put them into a stewpan with a piece of butter, the trim- 
mings, an onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, a slice of fat bacon, 
and a small teacupful of water. Let them stew till quite 
tender ; remove the tape, strain and thicken the gravy, and 
put them into the paste when it comes from the oven. 



FISH PIES. 
CODFISH PIE. 

567. — Take dressed codfish and cold oyster-sauce : put a 
little of the sauce at the bottom of a pie-dish, then a layer of 
flakes of codfish, with a little of the liver cut in small pieces, 
season with black pepper and salt, and a very little nutmeg ; 
repeat the layers until the dish is full, cover it with bread- 
crumbs and bits of fresh butter ; bake for f of an hour, and 
let the top be quite brown. A couple of sounds well soaked, 
boiled tender, and cut in small pieces, are a great improvement. 

Or : — ^Take a piece of the middle of a small codfish, and 
salt it well one night ; next day wash it, cut it in slices, season 
with pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place it 
in a dish, and put some butter on it, with a little good broth 
of any kind. Cover it with a crust ; and when done, raise it, 
add a dozen of oysters, i pint of cream, a little flour and 
butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give it 1 boil. 
B^,ke it a full hour. 



OuAP. XXII. FISH PIES. 407 

AN INCOMPARABLE LING PIE. 

568. — Wash and soak the salt out of a piece of the thin 
part ; boil it slowly ; remove the skin, and put layers of the 
fish and hard egg sliced ; add chopped parsley, with 2 oz. of 
butter in bits among it, till the dish is nearly full. Put in a 
seasoning made of a large teacupful of gra\y, with pounded 
mace and white pepper. Lay over H a good puff-paste ; and 
when that is sufficiently baked, put in a cup of hot cream. 

EEL PIE. 

569. — Cut the eels m lengths of 2 or 3 inches, after skinning 
them ; season with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with 
some bits of butter and a little water ; and cover it with paste. 
Middle-sized eels do best. They should be slightly seasoned. 
For a variety, the bottom of the pie-dish may be covered with 
a rump-steak, divided into small pieces, but not put in layers 
along with the fish, as many persons prefer eating the eels 
alone. The steak will produce abundance of gravy, to which 
only a little soy or ketchup should be added. 

A remarliably fine Fish Pie. — Boil 2 lbs. of small eels ; 
having cut the fins quite close, pick the flesh off, and throw 
the bones into the liquor with a little mace, pepper, salt, and 
slice of onion ; boil till quite rich, and strain it. Make force- 
meat of the flesh, an anchovy, parsley, lemon-peel, salt, pepper, 
and crumbs, and 4 oz. of butter w^armed, and lay it at the 
bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of soles, small cod, or 
dressed turbot, and lay them on the forcemeat, having -rubbed 
it with salt and pepper ; pour the gravy over, and bake. 

SOLE PIE. 
570. — Split some soles from the bone, and cut the fins close ,' 
season with a mixture of salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, and 
pounded mace, and put them in layers with oysters ; they eat 
excellently. A pair of middling-sized ones will do, and 2 to 
3 dozen of oysters. Put in the dish the oyster-liquor, 2 or 3 
spoonfuls of broth, and some butter. 

Pike, perch, and carp may be each made into savoury pies, 
if cut into fillets, seasoned, and baked in puff-paste ; but will 
be much improved by the addition of an eel to increase the 
richness of the dish, and even by a few gudgeons, mingled 
with the fillets. Sauce may be made of the bones, if meat be 



408 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXII. 

not allowed ; bat if veal broth be used, then cream should };e 
added. 

PILCHARD AND LEEK PIE. 

571. — Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks; 
scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into a disli, 
and between the layers 2 or 3 salted pilchards which have 
been soaked for some hours the day before ; cover the whole 
with a good plain crust. When the pie is taken out of the 
oven, lift up the side-crust with a knife, and empty out all the 
liquor ; then pour in t pint of scalded cream. 

This is a Devonshire dish ; and may be made, in the same 
way, of herrings, or any sort of fish, with or without cream. 

LOBSTER PIE. 

572. — Boil 2 lobsters, or 3 if small ; take out the tails, cut 
them in 2, take out the gut, cut each in 4 pieces, and lay in a 
small dish ; then put in the meat of the claws, and that you 
have picked out of the body ; pick out the furry parts from 
the latter, and take out the lady ; beat the spawn in a mortar, 
set the shells on to stew with some water, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of 
vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded mace ; a large piece 
of butter, rolled in flour, must be added, when the goodness of 
the shells is obtained ; give a boil or two, and pour into the 
dish strained ; strew some crumbs, and put a paste over all ; 
bake slowly, but only till the paste be done. 

OYSTER PIE. 

573. — As you open the oysters separate them from the liquor, 
which strain ; parboil them after taking off the beards. Par- 
boil sweetbreads, and, cutting them in slices, lay them and the 
oysters in layers ; season very lightly with salt, pepper, and 
mace ; then put ^ a teacupful of liquor, and the same of veal 
gravy. Bake in a slow oven ; and before you serve, put a tea- 
cupful of cream, a little more oyster-liquor, and a cup ol 
white gravy, all warmed, but not boiled. 



Chap. XXIII. FEUIT PIES. 409 



CHAPTER XXIII. 

FRUIT PIES, PUFFS, PUDDINGS, &c. 

574. — All pies made either with summer fruit or with winter 
preserves will be improved by a mixture of apples, pared and 
sliced. Apples will this way eke out the remains of a pot of 
jam with advantage. They are especially good with fresh 
cherries, currants, &c., and will be found an agreeable addi- 
tion to cranberries. Equal portions also of cranberries and 
any very sweet jam will improve both. When apples are 
mixed with jam, they should be sliced thin ; and if syrup be 
wanted, a few slices boiled with a little of the jam in sugar 
and water. In making pies of green gooseberries, apples, or 
rhubarb, the sugar should be clarified — that is, boiled in a 
little water, but no water poured into the pie, as it destroys 
the flavour of the fruit. Yov fresh fruits short crust is very 
suitable. 

Fresh Fruit Pies, of all descriptions, whether cherry, green 
gooseberry, damson, currant, or raspberry, may be all made in 
nearly the same manner, taking care that the fruit be fresh- 
gathered and cleanly picked ; also observing that, if the goose- 
berries be very sour, they should be put for I of an hour in 
boiling water, i lb. "of sugar is usually allowed to every lb. 
of fruit.* 

When pies have been kept until cold ths crust becomes 
hea\y and indigestible ; when next used they should there- 
fore be put before the fire to warm the crust and lighten it. 

Strew pounded loaf-sugar over the crust, or ice it with the 
white of an e^^ vrhipped up to a froth and laid over it. 

^ In making pies of a very juicy fruit, it is a common practice to put a 
teacup into the dish to collect the liquor, and thus prevent it from over- 
flowing the edges. This not only has a vulgar appearance, but is actuated 
by a false principle, as when the cup is tirst put into the dish it is full of cold 
air, and when the pie is placed in the oven the heat Vv-ill cause the air to 
expand and fill the cup, and will drive out all the juice and a portion of the 
present air it contains, in wlaich state it will remain till removed from the 
oven, when the air in the cup will condense and occupy a veiy small space, 
loavmg the remainder to be filled with juice, but this does not take place till 
the danger of the juice boiling over is past.

APPLE PIE. 

575. — Pare, core, and quarter the apples ; boil the cores 
and parings in sugar and water ; strain off the liquor, adding 
more sugar ; grate the rind of a lemon over the apples, and 
squeeze the juice into the syrup ; mix half a dozen cloves with 
the fruit, put in a piece of butter the size of a walnut ; cover 
with puff-paste. 

Codl'mg Tart. — Scald the fruit ; when ready, take off the 
thin skin, and lay them whole in a dish ; put a little of the 
water that the apples were boiled in at bottom, strew them 
over with powdered lump sugar ; when cold, put a paste round 
the edges and over. When the tart is baked, smear the crust 
Avith white of q^^, and sift over it some powdered sugar. 
Serve with custard. 

Or : — ^Line the bottom of a shallow dish with paste ; lay 
the apples in it, sweeten, and lay little twists of paste over in 

bars. 

Pippin Tarts. — Pare thin 2 Seville or China oranges, boil 
the peel tender, and shred it fine ; pare and core a dozen of 
good-sized apples, and put them in a stewpan, with as little 
water as possible ; when half done, add ^ lb. of sugar, the 
orange-peel, and juice ; boil till pretty thick. "When cold, put 
it into a shallow dish, or pattypans lined with paste, to turn 
out, and be eaten cold. 

New-fashioned Apple-pie. — Pare and quarter the apples, 
scald them, beat them with a spoon with some of the liquor, 
add grated lemon-peel, the juice of a lemon or Seville orange, 
or a part of a quince, when they are to be got, cloves, white 
sugar finely pounded, and a piece of butter ; put a paste 
round the dish, and cover it with bars or flowers of paste — 
the excellence of the pie consisting of the sort of apple and 
the goodness of the paste ; the fruit should be raised in the 
middle, as it shrinks in the baking. 

Stewed Apples. — Peel and slice 2 or 3 good-sized apples 
into a small stewpan, with a few cloves and some lemon or 
orange peel, and let it stew for about i of an hour in 2 
glasses of white wine. It may be done while the family are 
at dinner, and the apples eat better than in a pie. They 
should be thrown into cold water when sliced, to prevent their 
becoming dry and discoloured. The apples may be also 
mixed wUh pears nr plums, and will be found excellent. 



Chap. XXIII. TARTLETS. 411 

RHUBARB PIE OR TART. 

576. — Take the stalks from the leaves, and peel off the thin 
ikin ; cut them into pieces about an inch long, and as you do 
so sprinkle a little fine sugar into the basin. For a quart 
basin, jieaped, take 1 lb. of common lump-sugar ; put the 
rhubarb into it, with a tablespoonful of water, and as it 
simmers shake the pan often over the fire. It will turn yellow 
at first, but keep it very gently doing until it greens, and then 
take it off". When cold lay it in the tart-dish, with only as 
much syrup as will make it very moist. Put a light crust 
over it, and when that is baked the tart will be done enough ; 
fjuarter the crust, and fill the dish with custard or cream. 
Many persons think the fla,vour of the rhubarb injured by 
taking off" the peel. 

TARTLETS 

577. — Are always so called when made of a small size and 
uncovered with a crust ; nor should preserved fruit of any kind 
be put under crust. The paste is made stiff enough to support 
the contents, being cut thin, put into pattypans, and crimped 
at the edges. The fruit is then frequently ornamented with 
small strips of paste laid over it crosswise, which are made 
thus : — Mix i lb. of flour, 1 oz. of fresh butter, and a little 
cold water ; rub it well between the board and your hand till 
it begins to string ; cut it into small pieces, roll it out, and 
draw it into fine strings ; then lay them in any way you please 
across your tartlets, and bake immediately. 

The jam of raspberries, currants, or any other fruits, as well 
as the marmalade of apricot, quince, and apple, may be made 
into tartlets ; and when baked in a quick oven may be filled 
up with raw custard or whipped cream. 

Orange Tartlets. — Squeeze, pulp, and boil tender 2 Seville 
oranges ; weigh twice their weight of sugar ; beat both together 
to a paste ; then add the juice and pulp of the fruit, and the 
size of a walnut of fi'esh butter, and beat all together. Choose 
a very shallow dish or small pattypans, line it with a light 
puff crust, and lay the paste of orange in it. You may ice it. 

Lemon Tartlets. — Pare, rather thick, the rinds of 4 lemons, 
which boil tender in 2 waters, and beat fine ; add to it 4 oz. of 
blanched almonds cut thin, 4 oz. of lump-sugar, the juice of 
the lemons, and a little grated peel ; simmer to a sjTup ; Av^hen 
c-old, turn it into a shallow tin tart-dish lined with a rich thin 

t2 



412 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIII. 

pufF-paste, and lay bars of paste over ; as soon as the paste ia 
baked, take it out. 

Or: — Take the juice of 2 lemons and the rinds grated; 
clean the grater with bread, only using sufficient crumbs to 
take off all the lemon-peel ; beat all together with 2 eggs, 
i lb. of loaf-sugar, and \ lb. of butter. This is sufficient to 
make 12 tartlets, and will be found very excellent. 

Green Apricot Tartlet^. — When the wall-fruit trees are 
thinned, take the thinnings before the stone is formed ; stew 
them gently in sugar and water. When tender, reduce and 
thicken the syrup, and put it with the fniit into pattypans ; 
or, if covered with a paste, it is then called a pie. This also 
applies to grapes. 

Prune Tart. — Give prunes a scald, take out the stones 
and break them ; put the kernels into a little cranberry-juice, 
with the prunes and sugar : simmer, and when cold make a 
tart of the sweetmeat. 

It must be almost needless to say that tartlets oi damsons, 
plums, and most Lorts of stone-fruit, may be made in the samo 
manner. 

Tartlets a la Paganini. — Beat up the whites of 3 eggs to 
a froth, and then add 5 oz. of pounded sugar ; beat it well 
up, and have your pattypans ready covered with paste, upon 
which put any quantity you please of jam or marmalade ; 
bake them for about ^ an hour, and when done fill tliem with 
the whip. This quantity will fill 16 pattypans of a small size. 

TO PREPARE CRANBERRIES FOR TARTS, 

578. — Simmer them in moist sugar, without breaking, 20 
minuses ; and let them become cold before being used. A pint 
will require nearly 3 oz. of sugar. 

The Russian and American sorts are larger and better 
flavoured than those of this country. 

Stewed with sugar, they eat excellently with bread. 

PUFFS. 

579. — Itegent^s Pastry. — Take i lb. of almonds ground into 
flour, a little powdered sugar, and a few drops of some con- 
crete essence ; make it into a paste with the white of an egg ; 
then make another paste with sugar, flour, and butter, worked 
up with the wliites of eggs ; roll it out ; then lay it upon the 



' ,y 



Chap. XXin. PUFFS. 413 

almond-paste, and cut both together into shapes, brush them 
over with egg, then sprinkle chopped almonds over them, and 
bake upon buttered paper in a tart-pan ; ornament the pastry 
with jam when it comes from the oven. 

Apple Puffs. — Pare and core the fruit, and either stew 
them in a stone jar on a hot hearth, or bake them. When 
cold, mix the pulp of the apple with sugar and grated lemon- 
peel, taking as little of the apple-juioe as you can. Bake 
them in thin paste, in a quick oven : \ of an hour will do 
them if small. Orange or quince marmalade is a great im- 
provement. Cinnamon pounded or orange-flower w^ater may 
be used as a variety. 

LemGii Puffs. — Pound and sift i lb. of loaf-sugar, grate the 
rind of 1 large lemon or 2 small ones ; then whip up the Avhite 
of an eg-of to a froth, and mix all to»-ether to the consistencv of 
good paste ; cut it into shapes, and bake upon writing-paper, 
being careful not to handle the paste ; the oven must be very 
slow for this purpose. 

Cheese Pifffs. — Strain cheese-curd from the whey, and beat 
\ pint of it fine in a mortar, with \\ spoonful of flour, 3 eggs, 
but only 1 white, a spoonful of orange-flower water, \ of a 
nutmeg, and sugar to make it pretty sweet ; lay a little of this 
paste, in verj'- small round cakes, on a tin plate. If the oven 
is hot, \ of an hour will bake them. Serve with pudding-sauce. 

To those who make cheese, these puffs are not bad; but 
they are hardly worth the trouble of preparing the curd. 

Parmesan Piffs. — Take \ lb. of cheese, the same quantity 
of bread-crumbs, and 2 oz. of butter ; pound these v/ell in a 
mortar, beat up an o^'^'^-^ and mix it up into the paste, making 
the whole i:p into balls about the size of a golden pippin ; 
make a thin batter with flour, milk, and 1 ^^^ ; dip the balls 
into this, and fry them a light brown. 

Excellent Light Puffs. — Mix 2 spoonfuls of flour, a little 
grated lemon-peel, some nutmeg, h spoonful of brandy, a little 
loaf-sugar, and 1 q^^ ; then fry it, but not brown ; beat it in 
a mortar wdvh 5 eggs, whites and yolks ; put a quantity of 
lard in a fryingpan, and when quite hot drop a dessertspoonful 
of batter at a time ; turn as they brown. Serve them imme- 
diately with sweet sauce. 

Spanish Puff's. — Put 1 oz. of fresh butter into a quart stew- 



514 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIII 

pan ; when hot, put in 4 spoonfuls of flour ; stir it over ihe 
fire for 5 minutes ; have ready boiling a gill of milk, which 
stir in by degrees so as to avoid making it lumpy ; \vhen it is 
thoroughly boiled, take it off the fire, stir in 6 eggs, a pincli 
of salt, a little nutmeg, chopped lemon-peel, and a handful of 
currants, with sugar, and sufficient orange-flower water to 
flavour it ; let it get cold ; when wanted for use have some 
lard boiling, make the batter into balls the size of a small 
walnut, fry them until they burst ; drain; dust them over v>itli 
powdered sugar ; serve with wine-sauce. 

German Puffs. — Put ^ lb. of butter into i pint of milk, 
place the pan u23on the fire, and wlien it boils add a cupful of 
flour ; beat all well together, and, when cold, mix in 6 eggs, 
leaving out 2 of the whites ; beat up some sugar and grated 
lemon-peel with the eggs, and bake the puffs in a moderately- 
heated oven. 

Austrian Puff's. — 2 oz. of pounded almonds, the same of 
clarified butter and sifted sugar, 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, the 
yolks of 2 eggs, ^ pint of cream, and a little orange-flower 
water ; beat all together, butter the pans, fill them only half 
full, and bake for ^ an hour in a slow oven. 

French Puffs. — Take a pint of new milk, boil half, and mix 
the other half very smoothly with 4 heaped spoonfuls of fine 
flour ; then add it to the boiling milk, and boil it until it is a 
stiff paste. When cold, take the yolks of o eggs, the wliites 
of 2, a tablespoonful of sifted sugar, and beat the whole into a 
light batter in a marble mortar ; then drop it from a spoon into 
boiling lard, fry of a light brown, and serve it up with sifted 
sugar over each. A small piece of any candied fruit may be 
dropped into each spoonful of batter. 

Ii^ish Puffs. — Pound j lb. of sweet and 1 oz. of bitter 
almonds, but not too finely ; take i lb. of loaf-sugar poimded 
and sifted, the whites of 2 eggs beaten to a thick froth ; mix 
all together, and put the puffs into pattypans co\'ered with 
paste ; then sift powdered sugar over them thickly, and bake 
them a light brown. The flavour may be improved by pound- 
ing the almonds with orangf-e-flower water or a little essence of 
lemon. 

Lady Abbess's Puffs. — Take 3 oz. of Jordan almonds and 
^ oz. of butter, with 2 oz. of 'oaf-sugar ; pound them with a 



Chap. XXIII. GAUFFEES. 415 

little rose-water till they become a thick paste; spread the 
paste on buttered tins, and bake them in a slow oven. When 
cold, put a spoonful of jam in each, and cover it with whipped 

cream. 

GA UFFRES. 

580. — Take 4 or 5 oz. of flour, 3 oz. of pounded sugar, i 
pint of whipped cream, 4 or 5 eggs, a small stick of pounded 
vanilla, a grating of nutmeg, and a little salt, with a glass of 
cura9oa or ratafia. 

Place the flour, sugar, and salt in a basin, then add tlie yolk 
of eggs, the vanilla, and the spirit, mixing them well together, 
and gradually adding the whipped cream. Just before using 
the batter, add the whites of eggs, whipped to a froth, and 
mix them in lightly, so as to thoroughly incorporate them 
with it. 

Bake these gauifres in tongs made for the purpose, observing, 
ho\^'ever, that the iron be very carefully heated, and the super- 
fluous heat allowed to go off" previously to filling them with 
batter ; rub the tongs with fresh butter ; fill the bottom part 
with batter, and fasten on the top, then turn it, and, when a fine 
brown on both sides, shake some pounded spice and sugar over 
them, and send them to table. 

They may be spread with any kind of preserve or jelly. 
Gmiffres a la Flamande. — Take 6 eggs well beaten, mix 
into them h lb. of flour to a smooth paste ; dissolve a piece of 
German yeast, about the size of a nutmeg, in a wineglassful 
of warm water, with a gill of warm milk, a little salt, 2 table- 
spoonfuls of orange-flower water, and 6 oz. of butter; mix 
them with the flour till all is well worked, using a wooden 
spoon ; set it in a warm place for nearly 2 hours, when it will 
have risen 2 or 3 inches ; work it round a little to subdue the 
fermentation ; let it stand ^ an hour, and it will be fit for use. 
Put the gauffre-irons upon a slow fire, letting both sides be 
hot ; wipe them, and rub the inside slightly with a bit of fat 
bacon ; put in 2 spoonfuls of the paste, close the irons, and 
bake them for a few minutes. The colour should be a light 
gold colour, and very crisp. The irons can be half-opened to 
see if it is done. When of the proper colour, turn it out, and 
proceed with the remainder in the same way. Take 1 lb. of 
loaf-sugar, and i oz. of cinnamon, pounded and passed tin'ougli 
a sieve; dip the gauffres into it on both sides, and serve hof 
upon a napkin. Place them in the form of a pyramid.

3IINCE-PIES. 

5 S 1 . — In making these, the first thing to be done is to pre- 
pare the mince-meat. The following are selected from i\ 
variety of receipts, all excellent : — 

Take 2 lbs. of raisins stoned, 2 lbs. of currants, 1 lb. of 
sultana raisins, 2 lbs. of apples, f lb. of sugar, 2 lbs. of suet, 
the juice of 2 lemons, and the rind of 1 chopped very fine; 
i lb. of mixed spice,"* 2 glasses of brandy, 2 oz. of citron, and 
2 of candied lemon-peel. 

Or : — 2 lbs. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, boiled, and 
picked from skin, and 4^ lbs. of suet, all chopped very fine. 
Take 8 large apples chopped, 6 lbs. of currants clean washed 
and dried, a twopenny loaf grated, 1 oz. of nutmegs, i oz. of 
cloves, a little pepper and salt, \^\h. of sugar ; grate the peel 
of an orange and a lemon, add the juice of 6 oranges and 2 
lemons : mix all these ingredients well together, pour over tlie 
whole a pint of port wine and 1 of brandy. Add sweetmeats 
in making the pies. 

Or : — Take 1 lb. of lean beef, boiled well and chopped fine, 
2 lbs. of suet also chopped fine, 1 lb. of moist sugar, 1 lb. of 
carefully washed and picked currants, 1 lb. of raisins (when 
stoned, to be chopped), 9 good sound winter apples, peeled, 
cored, and chopped, and the grated rind of a lemon ; season 
with mixed spice and a teaspoonful of salt ; thoroughly mix 
the whole ; add a wineglassful of port wine and 2 of brandy ; 
press it down into a stone jar, and keep it well covered ; when 
the pies are filled, lay sliced candied peel on the top of the 
meat. 

The following we particularly recommend for its being com- 
municated by a celebrated tavern-keeper, from whom we have 
received much valuable information : — 1 lb. each of currants, 
Valencia raisins, llipston pippins, calf's-foot, and pickled ox- 
tongue boiled and chopped ; i lb. of suet, i lb. of sugar, ^ lb. 
of candied peel, H pint of wine and brandy, the juice of 2 
lemons, with a small teaspoonful of mixed spice. 

Any of these receipts being now prepared, mix the ingre- 
dients well together with the hands, and put it into a jar or 
jars for use. The flavour of the mince-meat will be much 

** 2 oz. cinnamon, 2 oz. allspice, 2 oz. cloves,. I oz. nutmeg, ^ oz. ginp;er, 
2 <.i2. coriander, all finely powdered and mixed, make a very good mixed s^'icc. 
and should be bottled and kept well corked.

improved by lying together a few days before it is used. It 
will keep good for many weeks, or even months. 

To make (he pics, have some pans of any required size, or 
a small dish or plate. Cover them first with a sheet of short 
paste, made with ^ lb. of butter rubbed in with 1 lb. of flour, 
and made into rather a stiff paste with water; then fill them 
well with the mince-meat, making it high in the centre, leaving 
a little space from the edge ; sprinkle or moisten these edges 
with water, and put on a moderately thick covering of very 
light puff-paste ; trim the paste off to the edge of the pan, and 
bake in a moderately-heated oven. When the crust is done, 
so are the pies. 

LE^^T PIES. 

582. — Boil a dozen eggs quite hard, and chop the yolks very 
fine ; chop also a dozen of moderate-sized juicy apples, peeled 
and cored, together with 2 lbs. of stoned raisins ; add 2 lbs. of 
currants, 1 lb. of sugar, and a tablespoonful each of powdered 
cinnamon, nutmeg, and beaten mace ; take also the juice and 
grated peel of 3 ripe lemons, with h lb. of citron cut into slips ; 
mix all these thoroughly, and moisten the whole with a pint 
each of white wine and brandy. A little rose-water may be 
added, and ratafia may be used instead of brandy. 

SWEET PA TTIES. 

583. — Chop the meat of a boiled calf's-foot, of which you 
use the liquor for jelly, with 2 apples, 1 oz. of orange and 
lemon peel candied, and some fresh peel and juice ; mix with 
them ^ a nutmeg grated, the yolk of an Q^g, a spoonful of 
brandy, and 4 oz. of ciurants, washed and dried ; bake in small 
pattypans. 

Croustade or Dresden Patties. — Slice some stale bread 
about ^ inch thick ; cut from it, with a round paste-cutter, as 
many croustades as will be required : mark the centres with a 
smaller cutter, scoop out the insides as in paste patties, then fry 
them a light brown, drain them well, and fill them with any 
hot compote of fruit or hot preserve. The croustade may be 
filled with any sort of minced meat or fowl, and served as an 
entree in the first course. They are very nice made with the 
rounds of a French roll ; it should be pared very thin, then cut 
in rounds of such thickness as to allow the centres to be taken 
out ; dip them in milk, and let them drain ; do not let them 
break •, brush them with e%g, and sift the rasping of the rol* 

T 3 



418 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIIL 

over them ; fry them a pale brown, and fill with oj^sters, stewed 
mushrooms, &c., or, as above, with fruit or preserve. 

Patties resemhling Mince Pies. — Chop the kidney and fat 
of cold veal, apple, orange, and lemon-peel candied, fresb 
currants, a little wine, 2 or 3 cloves, a little brandy, and a bi 
of sugar. Bake as before. 

Patties with Curds. — Take some very rich milk, put into 
it some lemon-juice or vinegar, place it on the fire that it may 
curdle, drain off tlie whey through a sieve ; add to the curds 
the yolk of an e^g beaten up in 2 spoonfuls of milk, a fev/ 
currants, and a little pounded cinnamon. Make the paste 
and prepare the patties in the same way as in the preceding 
receipt. 

CHEESECAKES. 

584. — Strain the whey from the curd of 2 quarts of milk; 
when rather dry crumble it through a coarse sieve, and mix 
with 6 oz. of fresh butter, 1 oz. of pounded blanched almonds, 
a little orange-flower water, ^ a glass of raisin wine, a grated 
biscuit, 4 oz. of currants, some nutmeg and cinnamon in fine 
powder, and beat all the above with 3 eggs and ^ pint of cream 
till quite light ; then line the pattypans with a thin puff paste, 
and fill them three parts full. 

A plai7ier sort. — Turn 3 quarts of milk to curd, break it, 
and drain the v/hey : when dry, break it in a pan, with 2 oz. of 
butter, till perfectly smooth; put to it l^- pint of thin cream 
or good milk, and add sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3 oz. of 
currants. 

Another icay. — Mix the curd of 3 quarts of milk, 1 lb. of 
currants, 12 oz. of Lisbon sugar, \ oz. of cinnamon and nut- 
meg, the peel of 1 lemon beaten in a mortar, the yolks of 8 
and whites of 6 eg2;s, a pint of scalded cream, and a glass of 
brandy. Put a light thin puff-paste in the pattypans, and 
three parts fill them. 

Miss Bratty^s Cheesecakes. — The yolks of 8 eggs, 8 oz. 
of sugar finely-powdered and sifted, 8 oz. of sweet almonds 
powdered, beat all together till very white. Line the pans 
vv^ith a thin paste ; immediately before you put them into the 
oven, mix the size of a walnut of butter melted into them over 
a fire. If the oven be too hot they will fall when taken out. 

Or: — 10 eggs, leave out half the whites, 1 lb. of sugar 



Chap. XXIII. CHEESECAKES. 419 

finely powdered and sifted, ^ lb. of flour, 3 oz. of butter, 3 oz. 
of sweet almonds, with a glass of brandy put into tliem while 
they are pounding. Beat them all together, and butter the 
pans very well. 

Without Butter. — Beat the yolks of 10 eggs and tlie whites 
of 5 separately, beat them extremely well, 1 lb. of sugar 
powdered and sifted, put to the eggs by spoonfuls ; beat both 
till very white ; add 14 oz. of flour, 2 or 3 spoonfuls of brandy, 
and some carraway seeds. 

Lemon Cheesecakes. — Mix 4 oz. of sifted lump sugar and 
4 oz. of butter, and gently melt it ; then add the yolks of 2 
and the white of 1 egg, the rind of 3 lemons chopped fine, 
and the juice of 1^, 1 Savoy biscuit, some blanched almondu 
pounded, 3 spoonfuls of brandy. 

Or : — Boil 2 large lemons, or 3 small ones, and after 
squeezing pound them well together in a mortar, taking out 
the inner skin ; add 4 oz. of loaf sugar, the j^olks of 6 eggs, 
and 8 oz. of fresh butter. Fill the pattypans half full. 

Orange Cheesecakes. — "When you have blanched -J lb. of 
almonds, beat them very fine, with orange-flower water, i lb. 
of fine sugar beaten and sifted, and 1 lb. of butter that has 
been melted carefully without oiling, and wliich must be 
nearly cold before you use it ; then beat the yolks of 10 and 
whites of 4 eggs ; pound 2 candied oranges, and a fresh one 
with the bitterness boiled out, till as tender as marmalade, 
without any lumps ; beat the whole together, and put into 
pattypans. 

Almo?id Cheesecakes, — Blanch and pound 4 oz. of almonds, 
and a few bitter, with a spoonful of water ; then add 4 oz. of 
sugar pounded, a spoonful of cream, and the whites of 2 eggs 
.well beaten ; mix all as quick as possible ; put into very 
small pattypans, and bake in a rather warm oven under 20 
minutes. 

A?iother. — Press the whey from as much curd as will fill 
2 dozen small pattypans ; then put it on the back of a sieve, and 
with i oz. of butter rub it through with the back of a spoon ; 
put to it 6 yolks and 3 M^hites of eggs, and a few almonds of 
both sorts pounded, vath as much sugar as will make the curd 
properly sweet ; mix with these a wineglassful of sherry or 
Madeira, in which boil the lind of a Seville orange, if you 



420 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Chap. XXlil 



can get one, or, if not, a large ripe one of the common kind, 
with ?J1 its juice. Beat all gradually togettier, and whtai 
thoroughly blended fill the pattypans; the baking will take 
from i of an hour to 20 minutes. 

Potato CJieesecakes. — 4 oz. of butter, the same of pounded 
sugar, 6 oz. of potatoes boiled and floured through a sieve, the 
rind of 1 lemon, and half the juice, unless acid is desirable ; 
mix these ingredients well together, with 2 eggs, and fill the 
tart-pan and bake it. 

CHEESECAKE-STOCK, that will keep for several years.— E. R. 

585. — ■To \ lb. of butter put 1 lb. of loaf-sugar broken into 
small pieces, 6 eggs, leaving out 2 w^hites, the rind of 3 lemons 
grated, and the juice of 3 ; put them all into a pan, and lot 
them simmer over the fire until the sugar is dissolved, and it 
begins to thicken like honey. When cold put it into sweet- 
meat-pots for use. When made into cheesecakes, add grated 
sweet biscuits. 

Line the small tartlet-pans used for these small cakes with 
good, but not too light, puflf-paste : make them of a deep 
yellow colour, and put on each a strip of candied citron. 

ICING FOR FRUIT TIES AND TARTS. 
586. — The common mode is to take the white of an eg<^, 
whisked to a froth, mixed thickly with pounded sugar, and 
laid on with a quill feather. For larger tarts it should, how- 
ever, be laid on more thickly, and comfits or lemon-peel may 
be stuck into it. 



PUDDINGS. 

587. — There are two different sorts of paste for puddings, 
one for meat and the other ^ot fruit. 

For Meat Pudding. — To 1 lb. of flour add 8 oz. of finely 
chopped beef-suet cut from the kidney. Mix it with water, 
but do not loet it too much : after mixing- it w^ell together 
with a w^ooden spoon, roll out the paste and put in the meat ; 
then close it ; boil it in a cloth which has been floured, tie it 
up, but leave sufficient room to permit the swelling of the 
paste. 

Veal-suet may also be used, but that of beef is better ; or a 



Chap. XXIII. PUDDINGS. 421 

mixture of both is not bad. If puddings be boiled in shapes, 
the crust is notliear so light. 

For Fruit Puddings the paste should be made as for a pie 
• — using butter instead of suet; but, unless for the sake of 
appearance, they should never be boiled in shapes. A very 
ittle salt added to all paste much improves it. 

Sweet Pudding. — Very good puddings may be made with- 
out eggs ; but they should have very little liquid added to them, 
and must boil longer than puddings icitli eggs. A spoonful 
of yeast will serve instead of 2 ^%%'&i and a pinch of soda will 
make it still lighter. 2 large spoonfuls of snow will supply 
the place of 1 ii^%^ and make a pudding equally good. This 
is a useful piece of information, as snow generally falls in the 
season when eggs are dear. The sooner it is used after it falls 
the better ; but it may be taken up from a clean spot, and kept 
in a cool place some hours, without losing its good qualities. 
Bottled malt-liquors are also a good substitute for eggs ; tlie 
sooner used after the cork is drawn the better. Eggs should 
always be broken separately into a cup before they are thro^^ii 
together, as, -without this precaution, a single bad one might 
occasion the loss of a great many : the yolks and Avhites, beaten 
long and separately, make tlie article they are put into much 
lighter. They must always be strained after beating. 

To avoid repetition, let it be observed that, when -pudding- 
sauce is ordered, wine, sugar, and very thick melted butter, 
boiled up together, is the sauce intended. 

If the pudding be partly of bread, the cloth should be'titd 
so as to allow for swelling ; if of flour, gather more tight. 
Basins or forms are much better in appearance than cloths for 
boiling puddings, but it makes them far less light. 

The water should boil quickly when the pudding is put ni, 
and care taken that it continues to do so, or the pudding ^^ill 
be heavy ; and it should be moved about for a minute or tv.o^ 
that the ingredients may not separate. 

All dishes in which puddings are baked should be lined with 
paste an inch or iv^o below the edge, as well as on it ; the disli 
must be first rubbed with butter. If a pudding is to be turned 
out from a mould, it must be entirely lined with paste. 

The ingredients of puddings should not be put into the basin 
or dish till ihQ minute they go into the water or oven. 

Bcgo^ and all sorts of seeds^ should lie in water an hour 



422 :?,IODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXHI. 

before they are made into puddings, and be ^yell washed ; the 
want of this caution causes an earthy taste. 

If the butter be strong that is used in puddings, they \^ill 
not taste well, whatever good things are added. 

A small pinch of salt improves the flavour of all mixtures, 
even when the other ingredients are sweet. 

Well-made raisin or Cape wine will serve, in most cases, 
when wine is ordered for puddings. 

As the goodness of boiled puddings greatly depends vipon 
keeping the ingredients closely but not too compactly together, 
the cook should take care to have moulds and basins in readi- 
ness that will exactly hold the quantity directed. 

Puddings of bread or flour are much better if all the ingre- 
dients be mixed (except the eggs) 3 hours before boiling or 
baking ; and they should be well stirred just before they are 
put into the oven or saucepan. 

Plum-puddings are best boiled in a stout cloth v>ell floured ; 
care should be taken that it does not burn to the bottom of the 
kettle ; to prevent this put a plate at the bottom. When the 
pudding is of a large size it is best to mix all but the liquid 
ingredients the day before it is boiled. 

When butter is ordered to be put warm into puddings, the 
addition of a little milk or wine will prevent its oiling. 

Custard Puddings to look well should simmer only, but 
without stopping. If boiled in a quick or careless manner the 
surface will not be smooth, but have little holes like honey- 
comb all over it. A sheet of writing-paper, thickly buttered, 
should be put on the top of the mould before the lid or cloth 
is put on, and the pudding should- stand in the mould 5 minutes 
after being lifted from the water. Many persons prefer their 
puddings steamed, but when this is not done they should be 
p«t into plenty of boiling water, and kept well covered. 

Ilaif an hour should be allowed for boiling a hread-pudding 
in a half-pint basin, and so on in proportion ; but puddings 
made up with \ lb. of suet, and any other ingredients, will 
require 2 hours. 

SUET P UD DINGS. 

588. — Finely chop 1 lb. of beef-suet; mix with it li lb. of 
flour, 2 eggs well beaten, a little salt, and as little milk as v»il] 
mix it. Boil 4 hours. It eats v/ell next day cut in slices and 
fried, and may be eaten either with salt or sugar. 



Chap. XXIII. MEAT PUDDINGS. 423 



Or : — Take 8 oz. of gTatcd bread, 3 oz. of finely chopped 
suet, and 4 oz. of pounded loaf-sugar, the juice and grated 
peel of 2 lemons, and 1 egg well beaten ; mix all together ; 
put it into a buttered basin and boil 1 hour ; or make it into 
dumplings, and boil 20 minutes. Serve with wine sauce. 

Of veal -suet, cut the crumb of a threepenny loaf into slices; 
boil and sweeten 2 quarts of nev/ milk, and pour over it. When 
soaked, pour out a little of the milk, and mix with 6 eggs well 
beaten and half a nutmeg. Lay the slices of bread into a dish, 
with layers of currants and finely-chopped veal-suet, 1 lb. of 
each. Butter the dish well, and bake ; or you may boil it in 
a basin if you prefer it. 

Balls of suet puddmg, not larger than the size of an e^^, 
are put into gravy soup. They will take from 20 minutes 
to h an hour boiling ; in that time they y>all be done through, 
and so light as to swim to the top. They may be also served 
separately, and are an excellent accompaniment to corned beef. 

BEEF-STEAK PUDDING. 

589. — Of all savoury puddings perhaps those made with beef 
are the best. The following is the mode of making them in 
all the clubs : — 

Take from 1 lb. to H lb. of the inside of a sirloin of beef, 
or the same quantity of rump-steak, cutting oif part of the fat : 
beat it until tender, cut it thin and divide into small slices 
along with 2 mutton kidneys or I veal kidney ; to these add a 
dozen of native oysters, bearded. The whole is then seasoned 
with pepper and salt, a minced shalot, and chopped parsley. 
Boil it from 2h to 3 hours. When done, have ready some strong 
beef-gravy, made savoury with a little mushroom ketchup; 
make a hole in the paste and pour it into the pudding. 

If for ix, family pudding the oysters and the kidneys may be 
omitted : let the steak be prepared as above, adding, if you 
choose, some layers of sliced onions. 

MUTTON AND KIDNEY PUDDING. 
590. — Cut slices from an underdone leg of mutton, with 
kidneys, suflScient to form alternate layers, mixed with some 
minced onions. It may be made either in a shape or solely hi 
paste, but in either case it should not be very higlily seasoned : 
it should, however, have some good gravy, to be poured into 
it when Ijoiled, for which walnut-ketchup mil be foimd mora 
appropriate than musliroom. 



424 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIil. 

RABBIT PUDDING. 
591. — Clean the rabbit well, take off the head, and cut the 
carcase into pieces, as for a fricassee, leaving out the rib-bones ; 
then parboil the liver, mince it and mix it with the brains : 
that done, season the fricassee with pepper and salt, a little 
mushroom powder, and a clove of powdered mace ; lay the 
fricassee in the paste, mingling with it the mince, and inter- 
laying it with a few thin slices of pickled pork: it will take 
nearly 2 hours boiling. The gravy may be made of the head, 
lights, and bones, with a bit of ham or bacon. 

CHICKEN PUDDING. 

592. — Fricassee 2 young chickens, season them slightly with 
a little mushroom powder, mace, nutmeg, and salt, but no 
pepper. Previously take the giblets and stew them down with 
a bit of meat to make gravy ; put 2 tablespoonfuls into the 
paste, and keep the rest to fill up or put under the pudding. 
2 hours will boil it. 

GA3IE PUDDINGS. 

593. — Game of any description maybe made into puddings, 
and v/hen partly boned, vrell spiced, with minced truffle or 
mushroom, mace, and a clove of garlic, and boiled within a 
light paste, they are very rich, and the paste particularly fine, 
as it absorbs so much of the gravy ; but the boiling deprives 
the game of much of its high flavour, and a vvoodcock or a 
snipe should never be so dressed, as they lose all the savour of 
the trail. 

Or : — Make a batter ^dth flour, milk, eggs, pepper, and 
salt ; pour a little into the bottom of a pudding-dish ; then 
put seasoned poultry or game of any kind into it, and a little 
shred onion ; pour the remainder of the batter over, and bake 
in a slow oven. 

A single chicken, partridge, or pigeon may be thus made 
mto a dumpling : — Stufi" it with chopped oysters, lay it on its 
back in the paste, and put a bit of butter rolled in flour on the 
breast ; close the paste in the form of a dumpling, put into hot 
water, and let it boil for 2 hours. 

^ FISH PUDDINGS. 

594. — Take 2 haddocks raw ; bone them, beat them fine in 
a marble mortar, rub through a sieve ; then put the fish into 
the mortar ^^•ith 2 eggs, 1 onion, a little parsley, pepper and 



Chap. XXIII. SAVEET PUDDINGS. 425 

salt, a slice of bread rubbed into crumbs, i lb. of veal suet 
chopped. Beat all together, put it into a shape, boil it an 
hour, turn it out and send it to table with a rich brown sauce. 
A little gravy-soup should be mixed with it whilst passing 
throu2:h the sieve. 

An excellent fish pudding may be made of eels, either alone 
or with kidney and o jesters, as in eel-pie ; some very rich beef- 
sauce should be made and put under the pudding if boiled in 
paste, or in a sauce-boat if it be made in a shape. 

HERB PUDDINGS. 

595. — Pick 2 handfuls of parsley-leaves from the stems, half 
the quantity of spinach, hearts of 2 lettuces, a large handful 
of mustard and cress, a few leaves of white beet, and a small 
handful of chives : wash, and boil all together 3 minutes ; drain 
the water from them, and mash very fine ; mix well, and add 
salt and pepper. Have ready a batter, made of 1 oz. of flour, 
a pint of thin cream, and 2 eggs ; stir it into the herbs, and 
cover the dish vnih. a good crust. 

This pudding has much the flavour of omelet ; and in Lent, 
when the salads are all coming into season, it may be very 
aptly brought to table on fast-days. 

Tansy-pudding . — Pound a handful of green tansy in a 
mortar ; add the juice to a pint of batter and bake it. 



SWEET PUDDINGS. 

Under this head the plum-pudding stands foremost as a truly 
national dish. The following receipt, communicated to a 
periodical publication by a man-cook of much experience*, we 
can vouch for as an excellent way of making a 

RICH PL UM P UDDING. ^ 

596. — Stone carefully 1 lb. of the best raisins, wash and pick 
1 lb. of currants,'' chop very small 1 lb. of fresh beef suet, 

* The best metliod of cleansing currants is to put them into a common co- 
lander, over a pan with sufficient water to cover them, nib thtira well between 
the hands in the water to separate the knobs, and stir them about. The 
smtdl sand and gravel will then tall through the holes and sink to the bottom 
of the pan. After being washed clean, and the water drained from them, 
the large stones can then be easily picked out by sorting them over on a Lirge 
dicili —Family Herald, 



426 MODEKK DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXTII, 

blanch and chop small or pound 2 oz. of sweet almonds and 
I'oz. of bitter ones; mix the whole well together, with 1 lb. 
of sifted flour, and the same weight of crumb of bread soaked 
in milk, then squeezed dry and stirred with a spoon until 
reduced to a mash, before it is mixed with the flour. Cut 
in small pieces 2 oz. each of preserved citron, orange, and 
lemon peel, and add i oz. of mixed spice : i lb. of moist 
sugar should be put into a basin, with 8 eggs, and well 
beaten together with a 3-pronged fork; stir this with the 
pudding, and make it of a proper consistence with milk. Re- 
member that it must not be made too thin, or the fiTiit will 
sink to the bottom, but be made to the consistence of good 
thick batter. Two wineglassfuls of brandy sliould be poured 
over the fruit an"d spice, mixed together in a basin, and 
allowed to stand 3 or 4 hours before the pudding is made, 
stirring them occasionally. It must be tied in a cloth, and 
will take 5 hours of constant boiling. When done, turn it out 
on a dish, sift loaf-sugar over the top, and serve it with 
wine-sauce in a boat, and some poured round the pudding. 

The pudding will be of considerable size, but half the 
quantity of materials, used in the same proportion, will be 
equally good. 

In addition to the wine-sauce, have a metal sauce-boat filled 
with brandy ; set it alight on the table, and pour a portion of 
it in a flame upon each slice of pudding. It will be found a 
great improvement. 

Shelf ord Pudding. — Mix \ lb. of currants or raisins, 1 lb. 
of suet, 1 lb. of flour, 6 eggs, a little good milk, some lemon- 
•^eel, a little salt. Boil it in a melon-shape 6 hours. 

Plum Puddings may also be made of different qualities, as 
folloAvs : — 

The same proportions of flour and suet, and half the quan- 
tity of fruit, with spice, lemon, a glass of wine, or not, and 1 
%<^^, and milk, will make an excellent pudding, if long boiled. 

A mealy potato, grated while hot, and beaten well with a 
spoonful of milk, will add greatly to the lightness of plum 
puddings, whether boiled or baked. 

Or : — A very light plum pudding may be made of grated 
l)read, suet, and stoned raisins, 4 oz. each, raided with 2 well- 
beaten eggs, 3 or 4 spoonfuls of milk, and a little salt. Boil 



Chap. XXIII. SWEET PUDDINGS, 427 



4 hours. A spoonful of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, in melted 
butter, may be served as sauce. 

"^ Or : — The French mode — Mix 6 oz. of suet, 7 oz. of grated 
bread, 2 oz. of sugar, ^ lb. of French plums, 3 well-beaten eggs, 
a small teacupful of milk, and a dessertspoonful of ratafia. 
Let it stand 2 hours, and boil it the same length of time. 
Observe to stir it well the last thing. 

These latter puddings may also be baked, 

HUNTERS PUDDING. 

597. — Mix 1 lb. each of suet, flour, currants, and raisins, 
the latter stoned and a little cut; the rind of ^ a lemon shred 

05 fine as possible, 6 Jamaica peppers in fine powder, 4 eggs, a 
glass of brandy, a little salt, and as little milk as will make it 
of a proper consistence ; boil it in a floured cloth or a melon- 
mould 8 or 9 hours. Serve with sweet-sauce. Add a spoon- 
ful of peach-water for change of flavour. 

This pudding will keep, after it is boiled, 6 months, if, after 
it is cold, it is kept tied up in a cloth, and hung up, folded in 
a sheet of cap-paper to preserve it from dust. When to be 
used, it must boil a full hour. 

31 ON TAG U PUDDING.— E. R. 

598. — I lb. of suet chopped, but not finely, 4 tablespoonfuls 
of flour, and 4 eggs, mixed into a batter with 4 spoonfuls of 
milk ; add ^ lb. of raisins stoned, and a little sugar, and boil 
the whole 4 hours in a basin. 

BA TTER P UDDING.—E. R. 

599. — To 6 oz. of flour add a little salt and a gill of milk ; 
mix them quite smooth, beat up 4 eggs and strain them, then 
add them to the batter, with more milk, until the mixture is 
ns thick as good cream. Strain the batter, and put it into a 
basin rubbed with butter ; tie a cloth over it, and boil it 1 hour. 
The excellence of a batter pudding mainly depends upon its 
being strained twice, that is, the eggs first, and then the whole : 
if this point be observed, it v/ill be as rich and as good as a 
custard pudding, without the danger of breaking. If it is 
wanted to be particularly fine, 1 or 2 eggs more may be added. 
Serve with melted butter, sugar, lemon-juice, and a glass oi 
wine.

degrees into a pint of milk, with a saltspoonful of salt ; simmer 
till it thickens ; stir in 2 oz. of butter ; set it to cool ; tlien 
add the yolks of 3 eggs ; flour a cloth that has been wetted, 
or butter a basin, and put the batter into it ; tie it tight, and 
plunge it into boiling v/ater, the bottom upwards. Boil it H 
hour, and serve with plain butter. A little ginger, r utmeg, 
and lemon-peel may be added ; or currant jelly may be laid 
on the top. 

CUSTARD PUDDING. 

GOO. — Flavour a pint of milk Avith the peel of 1 lemon, an 
inch of cinnamon, and a bay-leaf; when boiled sufficiently, 
strain it, and sweeten to palate : break 4 eggs, beat them up, 
pour the milk to them ; put it into a mould and boil for ^ an 
hour. . Serve with wine-sauce. 

Or : — Mix 1 tablespoonful of flour into a pint of milk ; add 
4 eggs well beaten, a tablespoonful of pounded loaf-sugar, 
and a little orange-flower water ; put into a buttered basin, 
laying a paper over it before putting on the cloth ; let it stand 
4 minutes before turning it out. It should boil ^ an hour. 

JBaked. — A plain but good custard pudding may be made by 
boiling a quart of milk until it is reduced to a pint ; take from 
it a few spoonfuls, and let it cool, mixing with it very perfectly 
one spoonful of flour, which add to the boiling milk, and stir 
it until quite cool. Beat 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs, strain 
them, and stir them into the milk with 2 oz. of moist sugar, 
2 or 3 spoonfuls of wine, and a little grated nutmeg. Bake 
it -g- an hour, or until it is firm and brown. 

MARR OW F UDDING.—E. R. 

601. — Four oz. of marrow, 4 oz. of biscuits, 3 oz. of jar rai- 
sins stoned, candied orange-peel, sugar, and nutmeg to the 
taste. Place these articles in layers in a dish lined with paste ; 
then beat up 4 ^gg^, leaving out the whites of 2, in ^ pint of 
cream or good milk, and pour it over the other ingredients ; 
.It will take H hour to bake. 

Or : — 6 oz. of marrow picked clean of fibre, and not too 
finely minced, to which add 4 oz. each of pounded macaroons 
and crumbs of bread, with 1 or 2 oz. of sweet-almond powder ; 
mix these together, seasoning them as above with candied 
citron, sugar, and nutmeg, but omitting the raisins. Then 
beat up the materials in a full pint of rich creara, and the yolks 



Chap. XXIII. S^YIl:ET PUDDINGS. 431 

proper. Pour over it another ^ pint of milk beaten up with 

2 eggs. 

BISCUIT PUDDING. 

G06. — Slice 4 common biscuits thin, boil them in 3 gills of 
new milk, with a piece of lemon-peel chopped as fine as pos- 
sible. Break it to a mash ; to which put 3 oz. of warmed 
butter, 2 oz. of sugar, and 4 eggs well beaten ; add a large 
spoonful of brandy. Bake or boil. 

Another. — On 3 grated stale Naples biscuits pour a pint of 
boiling cream ; when cold, add a teaspoonful of cinnamon in 
finest powder, the yolks of 4 and whites of 2 eggs, a spoonful 
of orange-flov/er water or ratafia, 2 oz. of loaf-sugar, and ^ a 
spoonful of flour, or almond flour, rubbed smooth. 

PUDDINGS OF ITALIAN PASTE. 
607. — Baked Vermicelli. — Simmer 4 oz. of vermicelli iu a 
pint of new milk 10 minutes ; then put to it ^ a pint of cream, 
a teaspoonful of pounded cinnamon, 4 oz. of butter warmed, 
the same of white sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs well beaten ; 
a little oil of almonds or a couple of spoonfuls of ratafia will 
much improve the flavour. Bake in a dish with.out a lining ; 
but observe that, of the 2 sorts of vermicelli, the G enoese will 
require f and the Neapolitan only ^ an hour of baking. 

Boiled Ver7nicelli. — Stir very gently 4 oz. of vermicelli into 
a pint of new milk over the stove, until it be scalding hot, but 
not more ; then pour it into a basin, and add to it while hot 
1 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar. When the above is nearly 
cold, mix in it, very gently, 2 well-beaten eggs, and imme- 
diately put it into a basin that will exactly hold it. Cover 
carefully with a floured cloth ; and turning the basin the nar- 
row end upwards, move it round for 10 minutes, and boil an 
hour. Serve with pudding-sauce. 

Macaroni. — Simmer 1 or 2 oz. of the pipe sort in a pint of 
milk, and a bit of lemon and cinnamon, till tender ; put it into 
a dish, with milk, 2 or 3 yolks of eggs, but only 1 white, 
sugar, nutmeg, 1 spoonful of peach-water, and ^ a glass of 
raisin wine. Bake with a paste round the edges. 

A layer of orange marmalade or raspberry' jam in a maca- 
roni pudding, for change, is a great improvement ; in which 
case omit the almond-water or ratafia, which you would other- 
wise flavour it with, or with a glass of brandy. 



432 • MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. CHAr. XXIIi 

Semolina and Tapioca are similar pastes, and may be used 
either for baked or boiled puddings in the same way as ver- 
micelli. 

ABU OWnOOT F UDDING. 

608. — Simmer a pint of milk with a few whole allspice, 
coriander-seed, and half a stick of cinnamon, for 10 or 15 
minutes ; then sweeten it with sugar, and strain it through 
a hair sieve into a basin to 1^ oz. of arrowroot (about \^ table- 
spoonful), previously mixed with a little cold water, stirring 
it all the time. When cold, or as soon as the scalding heat is 
gone, add 3 large or 4 small eggs, well beaten, and stir until 
the whole is perfectly blended. It may then be boiled in a 
well-buttered mould or basin, or baked in a dish, with a puff- 
paste crust round the edge, and grated nutmeg on the top. 
From i to f of an hour will be sufficient to boil or bake it. 
"VYhen boiled, serve it with wine-sauce. The flavour of the 
pudding may be occasionally varied, by using a few sweet 
and bitter almonds blanched and finely pounded or chopped — 
about 1 oz. of sv/eet and ^ oz. of bitter — or with brandy or 
rum| orange-flower water or vanilla. 

Or : — Mix 1 dessertspoonful of the powder in 2 of cold milk ; 
pour upon it a pint of boiling milk, in which have been dis- 
solved 4 oz. of butter and 2 of sugar, stirring all the time. Add 
a little nutmeg and 5 eggs. Bake ^ an hour in a dish lined 
with paste. Turn it out. 

Preserved fruits of any kind, laid at the bottom, eat well. 
If to look clear, substitute water for milk. 

Polenta Fuddi?ig. — Mix ^ lb. of polenta (or maize flour) 
with H pint of milk ; let it boil till it thickens ; put into it 
1 oz. of butter, a little salt and cayenne pepper ; bake it 
gently for H hour. Turn it out of the dish when served. This 
pudding is very good with meat. 

Sweet Pole7ita Pudding. — Mix the polenta as in the fore- 
going receipt : when it boils, add 1 oz. of butter, i lb. of 
moist sugar, the same of sultana raisins, the grated rind of a 
lemon, and 1 oz. of candied orange-peel sliced very finely ; 
mix the whole well together, and bake it U hour. The great 
recommendation of this pudding is the absence of eggs, whicli 
are not required with polenta. A cheap pudding may be made 
by adding 2 tablespoonfuls of treacle to the polenta instead of 
the raisins, sugar, and candied peel, 



Chap. XXIII. SWEET PUDDINGS. • 4;}3 

Sago Pudding. — Boil H pint of new milk, with 4 spoon- 
fuls of sago nicely washed and picked, to which add lemon- 
peel, cinnamon, and nutmeg ; sweeten to taste : tlien n)ix 
4 eggs, put a paste round the dish, and bake sloAvly. 

Millet may be used in the same way. 

MUFFIN AND CRUMPET PUDDING. 

609. — A very delicate pudding maybe made in a short time 
from a couple of muffins and 3 crumpets, placed alternately in 
layers, and either boiled or baked in batter. If boiled, they 
bhould be placed in an earthen jar, buttered on the inside, filled 
with the batter, and covered on the top. The muffins should 
be split open, and currant-jelly, slices of aiiple, or any sort oi 
fruit may be inserted. 

Or : — Half a dozen crumpets may be boiled without any 
fruit, after being dipped and covered in batter ; seasoned only 
with sugar and a little nutmeg. 

CHOCOLATE PUDDING. 
t)10. — Boil a pint of new milk; dissolve in it 1 oz. of 
chocolate ; sweeten it with loaf-sugar ; add the yolks of 8 
and the whites of 4 eggs well beaten ; strain and pour it 
into a plain mould buttered and papered ; steam it for ^ an 
iiour ; let it settle for 10 minutes, and serve with the fol- 
lowing sauce : — Boil t} a stick of vanilla in a pint of milk till 
it is reduced one half; strain it, sweeten with loaf-sugar, and 
thicken with arrowroot. 

SPONGE PUDDING. 

611. — Butter a mould thickly, and fill it three parts full 
with small sponge-cakes, soaked through with wine ; fill up 
the mould with a rich cold custard. Butter a paper, and put 
over the mould ; then tie a fiioured cloth over it quite close, 
and boil it an hour. Turn out the pudding carefully, and 
pour some cold custard over it. 

Or : — Bake it ; and serve with wine-sauce instead of custard. 

COC OA-N UT P UDDING. 
612. — Break the shell of a middle-sized cocoa-nut so as to 
leave the nut as Avhole as you can ; grate it with a grater after 
having taken off the brown skin ; mix with it 3 oz. of white 
sugar powdered, and about ^ of the peel of a lemon ; mix well 
together with the milk, and put it into a tin lined with pasto, 
and bake it not too brown.

RICE PUDDINGS. 

613. — Baked Rice Pudding for a family. — Put into a very 
deep pan ^ lb. of rice washed and picked, 2 oz. of butter, 4 oz. 
©f sugar, and 2 quarts of milk, with a little cinnamon powder. 
Eggs are not necessary, but a little veal suet or marrow, 
chopped small, is a great improvement. Bake in a slow oven. 

A rich Mice Pudding. — Boil ^ lb. of rice in water with 
a little bit of salt, till quite tender ; drain it dry ; mix it 
with the yolks and whites of 4 eggs, \ pint of cream with 2 oz. 
of fresh butter melted in it, 4 oz. of marrow, or veal kidney 
suet, finely chopped, | lb. of currants, 2 spoonfuls of brandy 
or ratafia, nutmeg, and grated lemon-peel. "When well mixed, 
put a paste round the edge, and fill the dish. Slices of 
candied orange, lemon, and citron may be added if approved. 
Bake it for 1 hour in a moderate oven. 

Another. — Wash 2 large spoonfuls of rice, and simmer it 
with -J a pint of milk till thick ; then put a lump of butter the 
size of an egg, and nearly h a pint of thick cream, and give it 
one boil. When cold, mix 4 yolks and 2 whites of eggs well 
beaten, sugar and nutmeg to taste, and add grated lemon and 
a little cinnamon. Bake -f of an hour in a slowish oven, and 
when the pudding is ready strew over it a little powdered lump- 
sugar and cinnamon poAvder. Currants may be added to the 
pudding. 

Or : — Boil ^ a pint of rice in new milk until perfectly ten- 
der and not too dry ; then add 6 eggs beaten, a spoonful of 
ratafia, sugar, and some grated fresh lemon ; mix well, and 
bake in a mould 1^ hour. Turn it on a hot dish, and stick it

pudding. Put it into a dish, or roll it into dumplings, and 
bake of a fine brown.

eggs ; melt i lb. of butter in a little of the cream ; then mix 
in i lb. of sugar ; when cool put in i lb. of fine flour and the 
eggs. This quantity will make 8 puddings, baked in small 
basins, at the bottom of v/hich put a tablespoonful of currants 
well washed. Bake t an hour, and pour over them brandy or 
wine sauce., 

Aiait Martha^ s. — Boil vj a pint of milk with a laurel-leaf 
and a bit of cinnamon ; pour it upon a cupful of grated 
bread ; add 3 eggs well beaten, a little grated nutmeg and 
lemon-peel, and a teaspoonful of orange-flower water. Sweeten

ERECHTUEUM PUDDING. 

617. — Take 6 fresh eggs ; let them be well beaten for 2 or 
3 minutes in a basin ; then add 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, a small pinch of salt, and 1 pint of milk. Flavour this 
mixture with 6 drops of essence of kernels ; butter a mould 
which will hold the pudding ; put it into a stewpan with water 
suflficient to come half way up the mould ; place it by the side 
of the fire for about i an hour. It must not boil, but keep as 
near that heat as possible. As soon as the mixture has set, 
the pudding is done. When about to serve it, breaii 2 fresh 
eggs into a stewpan that will hold a pint, 2 teaspoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, 2 drops of tie essence of kernels ; place it 
over a very slow fire for i of a minute, merely to warm the 
stevrpan. Whisk it with an iron whisk for 2 minutes, which 
will produce a very stroug froth, and pour it over the pudding. 

Be very careful not to^etthe pudding boil, and not to make 
the eggs too warm before beat'ng them for the sauce. 



CHAr. XXIII. SWEET PUDDINGS. 439 

QUAKING PUDDING. 

G18. — Scald a quart of cream ; when almost cold put to it 
4 eggs well beaten, 1^ spoonful of flour, some nutmeg and 
sugar ; tie it close in a buttered cloth, boil it an hour, and 
turn it out with care, lest it should crack. Serve with wine 
sauce. 

BRAND Y F UDDING. 

619. — Line a mould with jar-raisins stoned, or dried cher- 
ries, then with thin slices of French roll, next to which put 
ratafias, or macaroons ; then again fruit, rolls, and cakes iii 
succession until the mould be full, sprinkling in, at times, 2 
wineglassfuls of brandy. Beat up 4 eggs, yolks and whites ; 
put to a pint of milk or cream, lightly sweetened, h a nutmeg 
and the rind of t a lemon finely grated. Let the liquid sink 
into the solid part ; then flour a cloth, tie it tight over, and 
boil 1 hour. Keep the mould the right side up. Serve with 
pudding-sauce. 

THE BAKE WELL PUDDING. 

620. — Beat the yolks of 4 e^g'i and the whites of 2 with ^ 
lb. of powdered loaf-sugar and i lb. of clarified butter ; when 
well mixed, place it over the fire, and keep it constantly stirred 
till it thickens. Line a dish with puff-paste, and put in a layer 
of candied peel about an inch thick ; then pour the mixture 
over it and bake it in a slow oven. 

On this, however, it has been remarked by an intelligent 
cook, that " it will be found too sweet for most palates. I 
have frequently had occasion to make this pudding for both 
large and small parties, and have found that the addition of 
"5 a pint of milk, or milk and cream, to the eggs and sugar, 
with a little ratafia, or noyeau and brandy, to flavour it, has 
been considered a great improvement. I add the milk to the 
eggs and sugar when it is near boiling, without placing the 
mixture on the fire at all. Instead of using all candied peel, 
I prefer adding a portion of preserved fruits, such as dried 
cherries, greengages, and melon or pine-apple cut small ; and, 
when baked, occasionally spread over the top or ornament 
it with some apricot or raspberry jam, or some of each, to vary 
the colour. "When made in this way, it has been universally 
admired."

A BLACK-CAP PUDDING.— U. R. 

621. — Rub 3 tablespoonfuls of flour, smooth, by degrees into 
pint of milk, strain it, and simmer it over the fire until it 
thickens ; stir in 2 oz. of butter ; when cool add the yolks of 
4 eggs beaten and strained, and i lb. of currants washed and 
picked, laid at the bottom of the basin or mould previously 
well buttered. Put the batter into the mould, cover it tight, 
and plunge it into boiling water ; the currants downwards, 
that they may stick to the bottom and thus form the black 
cap. 

A S WEE T3IEA T P UDDIXG. 

622. — Cover a dish with thin puff-paste, and lay in it freshly 
candied orange, lemon, and citron, 1 oz. each, sliced thin. 
Beat the yolks of 8 and the whites of 2 eggs, and mix with 8 
oz. of butter warmed, but not oiled, and 8 oz. of white sugar. 
Pour the mixture over the sweetmeats, and bake 1 hour in a 
moderate oven. 

R OL Y-P OLY P UDDING. 

623. — Make a rich pudding-paste with flour and butter, 
without suet, but as light as possible. Roll it out thin, and 
cut it to the breadth of 8 or 10 inches, making it at the same 
tit.ie as long as you please ; but h lb. of flour and 5 oz. of 
butter, wetted with water, will probably be suflftcient when 
rolled out quite smooth ; then spread upon it a thick layer of 
raspberry, currant, or any other sort of jam, but leave about 
an inch of all the edges bare. That done, roll it round ; the 
roll of paste will secure the fruit, and the ends must be twisted 
together for the same purpose. Wrap it in a nicely floured 
cloth, and boil it for 2 to 3 hours according to size. 

Take it up quite hot, and when served cut it crosswise. It 
may appear homely, but it is an excellent and much-admired 
pudding. 

CABINET PUDDING.— E. R. 

624. — Take 10 penny sponge-cakes or biscuits, 6 oz. of dried 
cherries or sultana raisins, yolks of 6 eggs with the whites of

pint of milk ; butter the mould very completely, and lay the 
cherries or raisins in a pattern round the bottom and sides ; 
break each cake into 4 pieces, and lay them close to the fruit 
to keep it from falling ; then fill up the mould with the cus- 
tard. Lay a piece of paper over the top, put it into a stew • 



Chap. 5XIII. SWEET PUDDINGS. 441 

pan with 2 inches depth of boiling water, and be careful that 
the lid of the stewpan fits quite close to keep in the steam :

cream and brandy. Butter a quart mould, place dried cherries 
or stoned raisins in a pattern over it, pour in the mixture, and 
place the mould in a stewpan surrounded by water, and let it 
sinmier \h hour over charcoal.

weight of sugar and of butter, and | of the weight of fiour. 
Half melt the butter and beat it to a cream ; beat the eggs 
also, and mix them with the butter and sugar, beating the 
whole to a froth ; then add the flour, and the rind of a lemon 
grated ; beat all together, and pour it into a mould : an hour 
will boil it. This pudding may also be baked, substituting 
cream for the butter, which would render it more delicate 
than butter subjected to the dry heat of an oven. 

THE PROTECTIONIST PUDDING. 

627. — Break 7 eggs into a deep pan, leaving out 3 of the 
whites. Put 10 oz. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water ; set it 
over the fire until the scum rises ; pour it over the eggs ; add 
a teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and the juice of a lemon. 
Tvliisk them for 20 minutes ; shake in ^ lb. of flour ; pour it 
into a tin, and put it into the oven immediately.

628. — Boil 1 oz. of rice in milk mitil it will beat into a 
pap ; pare, core, and scald 6 apples, and beat them also with 
the rice, 1 oz. of finely-sifted sugar, a saltspoonful of grated 
lemon-peel, and a little lemon-juice, or a few drops of essence 
of lemon ; then beat the whites of 4 eggs until they make a 
strong froth ; add the other ingredients, whisking them well 
together, so as to be very light. Dip a basin or mould into 
boiling water ; pour in this soufile while the mould is quite 
hot, and put the mould into a pan of boiling water, boiling 
until the white of the ecrgs is set and .fi.rm. Have a custard

for turning out ; and when filled with the above, lay a crust 
over, as if it were a pie, and bake it in a slow oven. It is as 
good cold as hot. 

y^ Hoyal Nursery Pudding. — Pour scalding milk upon white 
bread sliced ; let it stand till well soaked ; then beat it vrell

rather less than 1 quart of milk, alternately with the batter you 
have just mixed ; then add the plums by degrees, and stir the 
vvhole together. Tie the pudding in a cloth that has been 
dipped in boiling water and then dredged with flour ; leave 
room for it to swell, but secure it firmly so that no water can 
get in. Put it into boiling water, and boil it continually for 
2 hours : do not take it out of the pot till the moment before 
it is wanted ; serve with pudding-sauce. 

PUMPKIN PUDDING. 

G40. — Take 1 pint of pumpkin that has been stewed soft and 
pressed through a colander ; melt in ^ pint of warm milk j lb. 
of butter and the same quantity of sugar, stirring them well 
together : 1 pint of rich cream will be better than milk and 
butter. Beat 8 eggs very light, and add them gradually to 
the other ingredients alternately with the })umpkin ; then stir 
in a wineglass of rose-water and 2 glasses of wine mixed to- 
gether, a large teaspoonful of powdered mace and cinnamon 
mixed, and a grated nutmeg. Having stirred the whole very 
hard, put it into a buttered dish, and bake it ^ of an hour. 

ORANGE PUDDING 

641. — Maybe made with 6 ripe oranges, 3 of Seville and 3 
of Lisbon, all peeled ; the rinds to be beaten in a mortar 
with ^ lb. each of fresh butter and moist sugar, to which add 
the yolks of 6 or 8 eggs, and make the whole into a batter 
with the juice of only the Lisbon oranges : the number of eggs 
to be regulated by the size of the fruit. Put the materials 
into a mould, with a paste around but not over it, and bake it 
for ^ an hour. 

An exceedingly nice Boiled Orange Pudding. — On \ lb. 
of crumbs of bread pour 1 pint of milk ; let it boil up ; stir in 
2 oz. of butter and 1 oz. of marrow, keeping the pan over the 
fire until all is incorporated. Let it become cold ; then mix 
in 2 eggs, 2 oz, of sugar, 2 oz. of orange marmalade, and 1 
spoonful of orange-flower water. Choose a basin that will 
exactly hold it, and tie it over with a floured cloth very closely. 
Boil it 1-1- hour. 

Or: — Take the rind of 2 oranges, pared very thin or

grated ; beat the yolks of 10 eggs ; put the orange-peel and 
i lb. of pounded loaf-sugar into the eggs. If there is time let 
it stand all night, if not, at least 2 or 3 hours ; then add ^ lb. 
of butter. Line a dish with puif-paste, pour in the mixture, 
and bake lightly. 

For sauce : — Melted butter, sugar, a little lemon-juice, and 
1 spoonful of brandy. 

LEMON PUDDING. 

G42. — Melt 6oz. of butter, and pour it over the same quan- 
tity of poAvdered loaf-sugar, stirring it well till cold. Then 
grate the rind of a large lemon, and add it with 8 eggs well 
beaten, and the juice of 2 lemons ; stir the whole till it is com- 
pletely mixed together, and bake the pudding with a paste 
round the dish. 

Or: — Take H lb. of bread-crumbs, ilb. of finely-chopped 
suet, the rind of 2 lemons grated and the juice of 1, 2 eggs 
well beaten ; mix the whole with i lb. of sugar sifted, and 
boil it f of an hour. 

Or : — Pare 6 lemons finely, and boil the peel till it is ten- 
der ; then pound it in a mortar, add the juice of 3 lemons, and 
i lb. of butter melted into a little cream, 3 sponge or ratafia 
cakes, the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites of 3 ; mix all up 
well together, with sugar to the taste, adding a little nutmeg 
and brandy. 

AN APPLE CHAllLOTTE.—E. R. 

643. — Pare and slice a quantity of apples ; cut off the crust 
of a loaf, and cut slices of bread and butter. Butter the inside 
of a pie-dish, and place bread and butter all round ; then put 
in a layer of apples sprinkled with lemon-peel chopped very 
fine, and a considerable quantity of good brown sugar. Then 
put on a layer of bread and butter, and another of apples, 
lemon -peel, and sugar, until the dish is full, squeezing over 
the juice of lemons, so that every part shall be equally fla- 
voured. Cover up the dish with the crusts of the bread and 
the peels of the apples, to prevent it from browning or burn- 
ing : bake it 1 i hour ; then take off" the peels and the crust, 
and turn it out of the dish. 

The above is the most usual mode of making it, but the an- 
nexed receipt is an improvement, furnished by a cook of high 
reputation. 

Charlotte de Pommes. — Take ^ a quartern loaf, cut the 



448 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIII. 

crumb in slices i inch thick, cut out of it as many pieces with 
an inch-round cutter as are required. Oil some butter, dip 
the round pieces of bread into it, and then place them in a 
plain mould in any way you please. Make a little crust witli 
a piece of butter the size of a walnut, worked up stiff with 
flour and water ; roil it out exceedingly thin, and then lay it 
inside the bread (this is merely to keep the ap^^le from burst- 
ing the bread). Boil sufficient apples to fill the mould, with 
a bit of cinnamon and green lemon-peel, add sugar to taste, 
a little nutmeg, and a small piece of fresh butter ; when the 
apple is rather stiff fill the mould, cover with a piece of bread; 
bake for 1 hour. 

If the bread is cut in long thin strips, and these made to lap 
one over the other, the lining of paste may be dispensed with 

APPLES A LA CRE3I0NE 

644. — Form also a beautiful dish. Choose such apples as 
will look clear when dressed ; pare and cut into pieces the 
form of a brick a sufficient quantity to weigh l-g- lb, ; strew 
over them l-g- lb. of good Lisbon sugar and several long strips 
of lemon-peel, and cover them close in a bowl. Next day 
put the apples, piece by piece, into a small preserving-pan, 
with the sugar, &c., and 2 large spoonfuls of strong cider. 
Simmer gently ; and as the pieces of apple become clear, take 
them out. When cold, build a wall with them on a small 
oval dish, and place the lemon-peel on the top ; pour the 
s}Tup into the middle. Serve cream to eat with it. 

The peel of China orange, cut very thin, does as well as 
lemon ; but the rind of Seville orange always gives a higher 
flavour. 

Apples d la Suedoise.- — Let the apples be pared and cored, 
but not cut apart, and simmer gently in a thin syrup of sugar 
and water till tender ; drain them, and fill the middles with 
any rich preserve : place them on a dish in layers raised the 
shape of a hedgehog. Have ready a compote of apples made 
by boiling 3 or 4 lbs., as for marmalade, sweetened and fla- 
voured with lemon ; pour this over the apples so as to fill up 
the space between each ; and to cover them spread over an 
icing made by the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, with 2 
large tablespoonfuls of pounded sugar : make the surface quite 
even, then sift over it some fine sugar. Blanch and slice 
lengthwise sufficient almonds to thickly stick over the whole ; 



CHAr. XXIII. SWEET'?. PUDDINGS. 449 

when done, put the dish into the oven, letting the apples be 
warmed through and the almond slightly browned. The 
number required must depend upon the size of the dish, but 
there should be sufficient to give the necessary shape. They 
may be stirred 2 or 3 sets in the same syrup, which should 
have T lb. of sugar to 1 pint of water. 

Apples a la Dauphine likewise form a very nice corner 
dish as thus : — Pare some of the large sort, make a hole at 
the end and scoop out the greater part of the pulp ; have a 
rich custard, with which fill up the hollow ; cover the apples 
with thin paste, ornamenting the tops with strips of it, and 
bake them in pans. 

A CHARTREUSE OF APPLES AND RICE. 

645.— Boil 6 oz. of rice with a stick of cinnamon in milk- 
imtil it is thick, stirring in a spoonful of rose-water or orange- 
llower water. Pare 10 or 12 apples — golden pippins are the 
best — scoop out the core, and fill up the orifice with rasp- 
berry-jam. Border a deep dish v/ith paste ; put in the apples, 
leaving a space between, and fill it up with the rice. Brush 
the whole over with the yolk of an egg, and sift sugar thickly 
over it ; form a pattern on the top with sweetmeats, and bake 
it for 1 hour in a quick oven. 

3IIR0T0N OF APPLES. 

G46. — Scald the apples, reduce them to a pulp, and pile 
them high upon the dish in which they are to be served ; boil 
1 teaspoonful of grated lemon-peel and 6 or 8 lumps of sugar 
in a teacupful of watar ; then add the yolks of 3 eggs and the 
white of 1, 4 oz. of butter, 1 spoonful of flour, and 1 of 
brandy ; mix the whole together over the fire, and stir it quite 
smooth. Pour it upon the apples, then whisk the whites of 
the other 2 eggs to a froth ; put them over the miroton just 
as it is going into the oven, and sift some sugar over it. The 
oven must be slow : it will take 10 or 15 minutes to bake. 

P03IMES AU BEURRE, OR BUTTERED APPLES. 

G47. — Peel the apples and remove the core without cutting 
them through, taking care not to break them. Cut slices of 
bread the circumference of the apples, butter a dish, put on 
the bread, and place an apple on each slice. Fill the hole 
made by the removal of the core with white sugar, place a 




450 MODEKN DOMESTMJ COOKEEY. Chap. XXHI. 

piece of butter the size of a walnut on each hole ; put tliem 
into a gentle oven, and renew the sugar and butter several 
times. They will take 20 or 30 minutes. Be very careful 
not to let the bread burn, or the apples lose their shape. 

GATEAU DE P03I3IES. 

648. — ^Boil sufficient apples (flavoured with cinnamon, 
cloves, and green lemon-peel) to nearly fill a l:|-pint pudding- 
mould. Pass them through a sieve, add sugar to taste, and 
2 tablespoonfuls heaped of potato-flour ; stir it over the fire, 
and, when rather stiff, add 5 or 6 eggs ; boil in a mould for 1 
hour. Serve with a cream-sauce thickened with potato-flour 
and flavoured with noyeau. 

F03I3IE 3IANGE. 
649. — Peel and core 1 lb. of apples, and put them with ^ lb. 
of sugar and i pint of water into a stewpan ; add the peel of 
a lemon. Allow it to boil until it becomes quite stiff, and 
then put it into a mould. It will be found excellent. 

FR UIT P UDDINGS. 

650. — Cranberry Pudding. — Boil l-^- pint of cranberries, 
cleared of the stalks, in 4 oz. of sugar and water, until they 
are broken and form a kind of jam. Make up a large ball 
of it ; cover it well with rice washed clean and dry ; then 
round each fold a floured piece of cloth, which tie as for 
dumplings. Boil them 1 hour ; sift sugar over when served, 
and butter in a boat. 

Wiuharh Pudding. — Cut small sufficient stalks of rhubarb 
to weigh about 1 lb. or li lb., which put into a clean sauce- 
pan with 8 or 10 oz. of sugar, the rind of 1 lemon grated, the 
juice, and \ a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Place the 
whole on the fire and stir it occasionally at first, but con- 
stantly at last, until reduced to a sort of marmalade ; take it 
from the fire, and, if appearance is to be regarded, pass it 
through a hair sieve into a basin ; mix with it about an ounce 
or two of good sweet butter, or a little good cream. Line 
rather a flat dish with puff-paste, thin at the bottom but thick 
on the edge. Wlien the preparation is cold fill the dish as far 
as the edge, and bake it in a moderate oven until the paste is 
done. 

Quince Pudding. — Scald some quinces till they are very

tioii of milk, or other flavouring than a glass or two of any of 
the highly flavoured liqueurs — either Curasao, noyeau, or 
maraschino, beaten up with the yolks only of strictly fresh 
eofgs, from which the " tread " has been picked out. If the 
liqueurs cannot be got, then simmer lemon or Seville orange 
peel, cinnamon, with a little nutmeg, brandy, or ratafia, if it 
can be had. 

These custards are very delicious, but may be improved by 
the addition of a few drops of noyeau. 

Orange Custard. — Boil very tender the rind of ^ a Seville 
orange ; beat it in a mortar to a paste ; put to it a spoonful 
of the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 4 oz. of lump- 
sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs. Beat all together 10 minutes, 
and pour in by degrees a pint of boiling cream. Keep beat- 
ing until tlie mixture is cold ; then put into custard-cups, and 
pet them in a soup-dish of boiling water ; let them stand until 
thick, then put preserved orange-peel, in slices, upon the 
custard. Serve either hot or cold. 

Or: — Take the juice of 12 oranges, strain it and sweeten 
it well with pounded loaf-sugar, stir it over a slow fire till the 
suocar is dissolved, takinu' ott" the scum as it rises : when nearh'- 
cold add the yolks of 12 eggs well beaten, and a pint of 
cream ; stir it again over the fire till it thickens. Serve it ir\ 
a glass dish or in custard-cups. 

Lemon Custard may be made in the same manner, or as 
fallows : — Strain 3 wineglassfuls of lemon-juice through a 
sieve ; beat . 9 eggs, yolks and whites, strain them also, and 
add them to the lemon-juice, with \ lb. of powdered loaf-sugar, 
a glass of white wine, and h a wineglass of water, with a little 
grated lemon-peel. jMix all together, and put the ingredients 
into a saucepan on the fire, stirring it until it becomes thick 
and of a proper consistence. 

Or : — Boil the rind of 2 lemons grated and the juice of 1 
in a pint of water; add the yolks of 14 eggs beaten to a 
cream and sweetened ; stir it one way till it thickens. When 
taken off" the fire add 2 spoonfuls of brandy.

CREAMS. 

In the common acceptation of the word, cream only means 
the skimmings of raw milk, or, when warmed, is called 
" clouted ;'* but the term is here applied to dishes in which 
cream is the chief ingredient, and which are usually called by 
the name of ih.^ flavouring materials. 

CHAMPAGNE CREAM 

657. — Is made by beating up the yolks of 6 eggs with as 
much powdered sugar as will make it quite stiff — so much so 
as nearly to make the spoon stand in it. Then pour on it 
very gradually — stirring it all the time — a bottle of sparkling 
champagne : grate on it a little nutmeg, and serve it to the 
ladies, who seldom refuse a second glass. 

A bottle of good cider or perry ^vill be a tolerable substitute. 

Leche Crema. — Beat up 3 eggs, lea^dng out 2 of the whites, 
and add to them gradually \^ pint of milk ; then mix ^^ery 
carefully 4 tablespoonfuls of fine wheat-flour and 2 oz. of 
finely powdered loaf-sugar, with grated lemon-peel to give a 
flavour. Boil these ingredients over a slow fire, stirring con- 
stantly to prevent burning, until the flour is quite dissolved. 
Prepare a shallow dish with some ratafia cakes at the bottom, 
and when the '•' crema " is sufficiently boiled, pour it through 
a sieve upon the cakes.* 

A VERY FINE ITALIAN CREAM. 
658. — "Whip together for nearly an hour a quart of very 
thick scalded cream, a quart of raw cream, the grated rind of 
4 lemons and the strained juice, with 10 oz. of white powdered 
sugar ; then add h pint of sweet wine, and continue to whisk 
it until it becomes quite solid. Lay a piece of muslin in a 
sieve, and lade the cream upon it with a spoon. In 20 hours 
turn it carefully out, but mind that it does not break. Garnish 
it with fruit-jelly or wdth flowers. 

Another. — Whip up f pint of very rich cream to a strong 
froth, with some finely scraped lemon-peel, a squeeze of the 
juice, \ a glass of sweet wine, and sugar to make it pleasant, 

* Some finely po^vdered cinnamon should be dusted pretty thickly over it. 
This delicious dish is always sewed up cold. The receipt was obtained 
from the nuns of Santa Clara convent at Palmas, in the island of Grand 
Canary. 



Chap. XXIY. CREAMS. 463 

but not too sweet ; lay it on a sieve or in a foV to a froth, 
dav put it on a dish, and ornament it "with very lasses with 
paste biscuits, made in tin shapes the length of a fii 
about 2 thick, over which sugar may be strewed, or h. 1 oz. 
glazed with isinglass. Or you may use macaroons to linnfuls 

edores of the dish. ""us

it has a very high flavour ; have ready dissolved in water 
1 oz. of isinglass, which mix with the milk, and li pint of 
line cream ; sweeten with fine sugar, and whip until quite 
thick ; then pour into the mould and set it in a cool place. 

Or : — Boil 1 oz. of isinglass in a pint of milk for 10 minutes, 
taking care it does not stick to the bottom of the stewpan. Put 
into it ^ a stick of vanilla ; cover it down, and let it stand till 
nearly cold. Beat up the yolks of 5 eggs, mix into them 6 oz. 
of pounded sugar, put these into a stev/pan ; take the vanilla 
out of the milk, which add to the eggs, mix them Avell, and 
stir the custard over the fire till it thickens, but do not let it 
boil. Strain it into a bowl ; keep stirring it, and when on the 
point of setting add -f pint of cream well v/hipped ; mix it 
well, and pour it into a mould ; set it upon ice till wanted, 
when dip it for a moment into warm water, wipe it dry, and 
turn over upon a dish. 

This is a very fine cream for a Charlotte Eusse ; but there 
should be a little more isinglass added, and a glass of brandy. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 
660. — Line the bottom of a plain round mould with Savoy 
biscuits, placing them close together in a star or some device ; 
line the sides, placing the biscuits edgeways, to make them

begins to set. Whip nearly a pint of cream to a light froth, 
and stir it into the strawberries ; fill the mould, and let it 
remain upon the ice until wanted to serve, when plunge it 
into warm water for an instant, wipe it dry, and turn out the 
cream on the dish. 

CliEME A U CARAMEL. 
662. — Melt 1 lb. of pounded sugar over a slow fire till it 
begins to tint, stirring it all the time ; boil an oz. of isinglass 
in a pint of milk, pour it upon the caramel, stirring it until it 
is quite dissolved. Beat up the yolks of 5 eggs, put them into 
a stewpan, pour the caramel and isinglass upon them ; stir

take out the spice, &c. ; pour it into the dish ; when cold strew 
Avhite pounded sugar over, and brown it with a salamander. 

Or : — Make a rich custard without sugar, boiling lemon- 
peel in it. When cold, sift a good deal of sugar over the 
whole, and brown the top with a salamander.

of 3 lemons sweetened : beat it up with a whisk to a froth, 
which take off on the shallow part of a sieve ; fill glasses with 
some of the liquor and the froth. 

Or: — Blanch and pound 1^ oz. of sweet almonds with 1 oz. 
each of candied citron and lemon peel ; rub 2 tablespoonfuls 
of flour into a quart of new milk ; add the yolks of 5 egus

sugar over the lemon-peel, and thus sweeten it to the taste. 
Then add a pint of cream, strain the isinglass and wine, stir 
the whole well together, and put it into the moulds. It re- 
quires no boiling after the cream is added, the isinglass, wine, 
and sugar having been previously boiled together. Be care- 
ful not to mix the wine and cream together until quite cold. 
Half the above materials ought to fill a mould. 

Cliocolate Cream. — Scrape into 1 quart of thick cream 1 oz. 
ol the heat chocolate and i lb. of sugar ; boil and mill it ; 
when quite smooth take it off, and leave it to be cold ; then

of a lemon, then stir till nearly cold ; have ready, in a dish 
or bowl that you are to serve in, the juice of 3 lemons, strained, 
with as much sugar as will sweeten the cream ; pour the cream 
into the dish from a large teapot, holding it high, and moving- 
it about to mix with the juice. It should stand at least 6 
hours before it is served, and will be still better if kept a day. 

Hhenish Cream. — Dissolve 1 oz. of isinglass in 1 pint of 
hot water, let it stand until cold ; take the yolks of 5 eggs, the 
peels of 2 and the juice of 3 lemons, ■3- pint of white wine,

FRUIT CREAMS, 

QQQ. — Take ^ oz. of isinglass, dissolved in a little water, then 
put 1 pint of good cream, sweetened to the ta^te ; boil it ; when 
nearly cold, lay some apricot or raspberry jam on the bottom 
of a glass dish, and pour it over. This is most excellent. 

Codling Cream. — Pare and core a score of codlings ; beat 
them in a mortar with a pint of cream ; strain it into a dish, 
and put sugar, bread-crumbs, and a glass of wine to it. Stir 
it well. 

Gooseberry Cream. — Boil 2 lbs. of green gooseberries in 
1^ pint of water; when thoroughly mashed strain them; to 
every lb. of juice add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, let them boil for 20 
minutes. Dissolve 1 oz. of isinglass in ^ pint of cream, taking 
care it does not boil ; stir it till nearly cold ; add it to the 
gooseberiy syrup, which should be nearly cold ; add also the 
juice of a lemon ; put it into a mould and set it upon ice. It 
should be made the day before wanted. 

Excellent Orange Cream. — Boil the rind of a Seville orange 
very tender ; beat it fine in a mortar ; put to it a spoonful of 
the best brandy, the juice of a Seville orange, 4 oz. of loaf- 
sugar, and the yolks of 4 eggs ; beat all together for 10 
minutes ; then, by gentle degrees, pour in a pint of boiling 
cream ; beat till cold ; put into custard-cups set into a deep 
dish of boiling water, and let them stand till cold again^ 



CHAr. XXIV. CREAMS. 4G3 

Put at the top small strips of orang-e-paring cut thin, or pre- 
served chips. 

Or : — Take 5 Seville oranges, cut a piece off the top, grate 
the rind gently, then boil them in several waters till the bitter 
is quite out, but they must not be so soft as to break ; take out 
the seeds and pulp. Boil up a thick syrup, and put the oranges 
into it; let them boil till they look preserved ; put them into 
:i dish and pour the syrup over them. Then take the yolks of 
6 eggs well beaten, some Naples biscuits or grated bread, a 
little lemon-peel, a gill of cream, and a glass of sweet wine, 
M-itli i lb. of butter ; sweeten to taste ; thicken them over the 
fire ; fill the oranges, put the bit on the top, and set them in 
1 he oven. To be eaten hot. 

Lemon Cream. — Take a pint of cream, add the zest of a 
lemon rubbed on sugar ; whip it well ; add sugar and lemon- 
juice to palate. Have \ oz. of isinglass dissolved and cool ; 
when the cream is thick, wliieh it will be when the lemon- 
juice is added, pour in the isinglass, and immediately mould 
it. A smaller quantity of isinglass may suffice, but that 
depends on the thickness of the cream. 

Other flavours may be used, as orange, almond, maraschino. 

Or : — Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolks 
of 2 eggs well beaten, 4 oz. of fine sugar, and the thin rind 
of a lemon ; boil it up, then stir it till almost cold ; put the 
juice of a lemon in a dish or bowl, and pour the cream upon 
it, stirring it till quite cold. 

Honeycomb Cream. — Take the juice of 1 fine lemon and 
of 2 Seville oranges ; make it very sweet ; put it into a glass 
dish and set it upon the ground ; boil a pint of cream and 
put it into a teapot made very hot. Pour the cream upon the 
juice, holding the pot as high as possible : let it remain quite- 
still till cold. A little orange or rose water might be added, 
to the juice. 

Saspberry Cream. — Boil 1 oz. of isinglass in H pint of 
new milk ; strain it through a hair sieve into a basin ; boil \^ 
pint of cream ; when cool, put about ^ pint of raspberry-juice, 
or syrup, to the cream ; then add the milk ; stir it till well 
incorporated ; sweeten, and add a glass of brandy ; whisk it 
about till three parts cold ; then put it ir^o a mould till quite 
cold. In summer use the fresh juice. Mash the fruit gently, 
and let it drain ; then sprinkle a little sugar over, and that will

sweet almonds ; when cold, pound them in a mortar with 1 lb. 
of loaf-sugar ; rub the whole through a wire sieve ; rub in f lb. 
of butter, the grated rind of ^ a lemon, and the yolks of 3 eggs 
well beaten ; make therti all up into a paste ; roll it out and 
cut it into shapes, and bake them in a quick oven ; ^vhe^ 
done, dip them into sugar boiled to a syrup, and let them be 
kept dry. They make a very nice garnish for sweet dishes of 
almost every kind. 

ICE CREAjMB. 
674. — To 1 lb. of preserved fruit of any kind add a quart 
of cream, the juice of 2 lemons to heighten the flavour, and 
sugar to your taste. Rub the whole through a fine hair sieve ; 
and to raspberry, or any other red fruit, add a little cochineal 
colouring, to give a better tint. 

TO PREPARE ICE FOR ICING. 

675. — Get a few pounds of ice; a pailful is necessary to 
freeze a quart of cream ; break it almost to powder, throw 
3 or 4 large handfuls of rock-salt among it. You must pre- 
pare it in a part of the house where as little of the v/arm air 
comes as you can possibly contrive. The ice and salt being 
in a bucket, put your cream into an icepot, and cover it ; 
immerse it in the ice till quite cold, then twist the pot rapidly 
round. In a few minutes put a spoon in and stir it well, 
removing the parts that ice round the edges to the centre. If 
the ice cream or water be in a form, shut the bottom close, 
and move the whole in the ice, as you cannot use a spoon to 
that without danger of waste. There should be holes in the 
bucket, to let off the water as the ice thaws. 

Freezing powders for generating ice are now also much in 
use, and can be procured of the patentees, King and Keith, 
Princes-street, Leicester-square.'^ 

Ratafia Cream Ice. — Blanch \ oz. of bitter almonds, and 
beat them with a teaspoonful of water in a marble mortar ; 
then rub with the paste 2 oz. of lump-sugar, and simmer 10 
minutes with a teacupful of cream, which add to a quart more 
of cream, and, having strained, ice it. 

Brown Bread Ice. — Grate as fine as possible stale brown 

* When anj' fluid tends towards cold, mo\M'r.g it quickly accelerates the 
cold; and likewise, when any fluid is tending to heat, stirring it will facilitaie 
its boiling. 



Chap. XXIV. CKEAMS, &c. 469 

bread, soak a small proportion in cream 2 or 3 hours, sweeten, 
and ice it ; but keep stirring-, that the bread may not sink. 

Vanilla Creani, if iced ^ is made with a decoction or essence 
of that spice mixed with the cream. 

Iced Custard is also very good. 

Almond Cream Ice. — Take 6 oz. of bitter almonds (sweet 
ones will not do), blanch them, and pound them in a mortar, 
adding by degrees a little rose-water. Boil them gently in 
a pint of cream till you find that it is highly flavoured with 
them. Then pour the cream into a bowl, stir in ? lb. of pow- 
dered loaf-sugar, cover it, and set it av/ay to cool gradually. 
When it is cold, strain it, and then stir it quickly into 3 pints 
of cream. Put it into the freezer, and proceed as directed^ 
Freeze it twice. It will be found very fine. 

Send round wafers and sponge-cake with ice cream : after- 
wards liqueurs. 

WATER ICES 

676. — Are made with the juice of lemon, currant, or rasp- 
berry, or any other sort of fruit, sweetened and mixed with 
water. Rub some fine sugar on lemon or orange, to give the 
colour and flavour, then squeeze the juice of either on its 
respective peel ; add water and sugar to make a fine sherbet, 
and strain it before it be put into the icepot. If orange, the 
greater proportion should be of the China juice, and only a little 
of Seville, and a small bit of the peel grated by the sugar. 

To make Ice Punch, as used in Italy. — JMix a rich sherbet, 
and grate a piece of sugar on a lemon or citron for flavour ; 
then beat the whites of 5 or 6 eggs to a froth, and by degrees 
stir it into the sherbet : add rum, ice it, and serve in glasses. 

TRIFLE.— E. R. 

677. — Place at the bottom of the trifle-dish a layer of maca- 
roons and ratafia-cakes, and pour over them as nmch sweet 
wine as they u ill absorb. Squeeze the juice of a lemon, and 
add it to a pint of cream not too thick ; sweeten the cream with 
sugar rubbed upon the rind ; add a little brandy. Whisk the 
mixture, and as the froth rises lay it on a sieve to drain ; and 
if it is too thick add to it a little ^^ ater. When enough has 
been drained for the purpose, make a custard with the remain- 
ing cream and that which has drained from the froth ; put it 
on a very slow fire with 2 laurel-leaves, and when nearly boiling 



470 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIV. 

take it off, and add the yolks of 4 eggs and the whites of 2 — 
the number necessary for a pint of custard. Put it again on 
the fire, stirring slowly one way till it thickens, but taking care 
not to allow it to come to a boil. Cover the macaroons witl) 
raspberry or other jam, then pour on the custard ; and when 
the custard is quite cold put on the froth, sprinkling harlequin 
comfits on the top, and garnishing with different-coloured 
sweetmeats. 

In some of the good old-fashioned receipts for trifle, a layer 
of calf 's-foot jelly is added to the others. Modern trifles 
are often trifles indeed, merely consisting of a few cakes and a 
little froth. 

TIFSY CAKE, 

678. — Take a savoy cake; stick almonds, cut in fillets, 
regularly in it ; pour equal quantities of wine and brandy over, 
as much as it will imbibe ; smother it mth a rich thick cus- 
tard ; lay preserves at the bottom of the dish. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

679. — Mix 3 i-pints of thin cream with i pint of raisin 

wine, a little lemon- juice, orange-fiower water, and sugar ; 

put into a dish for the middle of the table, and put on the 

cream a froth, which maj'' be made of raspberry or currant 

jelly. 

A?wtlier li-ay. — Scald a codling before it be ripe, or any 
sharp apple ; pulp it through a sieve. Beat the whites of 2 
eggs with sugar and a spoonful of orange-flower water ; mix 
in by degrees the pulp, and beat together until you have a 
large quantity of froth ; serve it on raspberry cream or put it 
on a custard. 

BLANCMANGE.— E. B. 

680. — Boil W oz. of isinglass, 3 oz. of sweet and 6 bitter 
almonds, well pounded in a quart of milk ; let it boil until the 
ishiglass is dissolved; then sweeten it, strain it through a 
napkin, stir it until nearly cold, and put it into the mould. 

Or : — To a pint of noAV milk and as much cream add 1^ oz. 
of the best isinglass, a large handful of sweet and bitter almonds 
pounded In a mortar and moistened with water, 3 oz. of fine 
sugar, and 2 bay or peach leaves. Boil the whole until the 
ismglass is dissolved, then strain it into a basin, let it stand 
until it is cold, turn it out and take off the sediment, warm it 
up again by putting the ba«ln into hot water ; flavour it with 



Chap. XXIV. 



CREAMS, S:c.

a little orange-flower \yater, stir it until it is nearly cold, and 
then put it into the mould. Observe to wash the ising-lass in 
cold water before it is put to the milk, and soak the moulds in 
cold water some hours before they are used. 




Rice Mould. 



American Blanc7nange. — ^lix 2 oz. of arrowroot in t^- pint 
of cold water ; let it settle for t of an hour ; pour off the water 
and add a tablespoonful of orange or rose water ; sweeten 1 
quart of new milk ; boil it with a bit of cinnamon, half the 
peel of a lemon, and 4 laurel or bay leaves ; pour the boiling- 
milk upon the arrov/root, stirring it all the time : put it into a 
mould and turn it out the following day. 

WHOLE RICE IN A SHAPE. 

681. — Wash a large teacupful of rice in several waters ; put 
it into a stewpan with cold 
water to cover it ; when it 
boils add 2 cupfuls of rich 
milk or thin cream, with a 
piece of cinnamon, a little 
fresh lemon-peel, and a laurel- 
leaf ; boil it till the rice is soft; 
sweeten it ; put it into a mould 
and press it down tight : when 
cold turn it out and serve with sweetmeat or jelly round it. If 
put into a cylindrical mould, the centre should be filled with 
fruit or sweetmeat. 

G O OSEBERR Y-FO OL. 

682. — Put the fruit into a stone jar, with some sugar ; set 
the jar on a stove, or in a saucepan of water over the fire ; if 
the former, a large spoonful of water should be added to the 
fruit. When it is done enough to pulp, press it through a 
colander ; have ready a teacupful of new milk and the same 
quantity of raw cream boiled together, and left to be cold ; 
then sweeten pretty Avell with fine sugar, and mix the pulp by 
degrees with it. 

Or : — Mix equal proportions of gooseberry pulp and custard- 

For Orange-fool. — Mix the juice of 3 Seville oranges, 3 
eggs well beaten, a pint of cream, a little nutmeg and cinna- 
mon, and sweeten to your taste. Set the whole over a slow 
fire, and stir it till it becomes as thick as good melted butter, 



472 MODER>T DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIV. \ 

but it must not be boiled ; then pour it into a dish for eating \ 

colfl. i 

JFo)' Apple-fool. — Stew apples as directed for gooseberries, j 

and then peel and pulp them. Prepare the milk, &;c., and ^ 
mix as before. 

N0R3fAND Y PIPPINS. ^ 

683. — These form a very convenient second-course dish j 

wlien there is custard at table, it being particularly suited to \ 

the flavour. They are to be obtained at all the grocers', and i 

should be soaked in cold water for about 12 hours. To every i 

lb. of apples put a quart of water and ^ lb. of moist sugar, j 

with about a dozen cloves and a little fresli lemon- peel ; let j 

them simmer till quite tender ; when cold lay them in a dish, j 

lay tliin strips of lemon-peel over the tops, and pour over I 

them as much of the syrup as the dish will hold. I 

i 

SYLLAB UBS.—E. R. j 

684. — Solid Syllabub. — Grate off the peel of a lemon with j 

lump-sugar, and dissolve the sugar in f pint of wine : add the : 

juice of ^ a lemon and i pint of cream ; whisk the whole j 

together until of a proper thickness, and then put it into , 

glasses. \ 

London Syllabub. — Put 1^ pint of port or white wine into j 

a bowl, nutmeg grated, and a good deal of sugar, tlien pour : 

into it near 2 quarts of hot milk, frothed up. If the wine be 

not rather sharp, it will require more for this quantity of milk. \ 

i 

Staffordshire Syllabub. — Put a pint of cider, and a glass i 

of brandy, sugar, and nutmeg, into a bowl, and milk into it:, ' 

or pour warm milk from a large teapot some height into it. 

A very fine Somersetshire and Devonshire Syllabub. — In \ 

X large china bowl put a pint of port, and a pint of sherry or ' 

other white wine; sugar to taste. Milk the bowl full. In : 

20 minutes' time cover it pretty high with clouted cream ; i 

grate over it nutmeg, put pounded cinnamon and nonpareil ' 

comfits. ! 

Everlasting Syllabubs. — Mix a quart of thick raw cream, j 

I lb. of refined sufj,ar, 1^ pint of fine raisin wine, in a deei> j 

pan; put to it the grated peel and the juice of 3 lemons. \ 

Beat or whisk it one way ^ an hour ; keep taking off the top ' 

with a spoon. Put it in glasses, sDrinkle a few harlequin \

sugarplums on tne top. It will keep good, in a cool place, a 
fortnight. 

DEVONSHIRE JUNKET. 

7 685. — Put warm milk into a bowl; turn it with rennet; 
then put some scalded cream, sugar, and cinnamon on the 
top, without breaking the curd. 

Or : — Put some new milk into a china or other basin, or 
else warm some cold milk to the same heat as new, add to it 
a little calf's rennet, and, if approved, a little brandy or rum 
may also be added; stir it with a spoon so as to mix the 
whole perfectly. Place it near the fire or on a warm stove or 
hearth until turned, but it must not be kept too hot, or it will 
not turn properly. When turned, put sugar, grated nutmeg, 
or nutmeg and ground cinnamon, on the top, and scalded or 
clouted cream, v/ithout breaking the curd, and serve. 

ITALIAN CHEESE.— E. R. 

686. — \i pint of cream, 2 lemons and the rind, a pint of 
sweet wine, a few pounded almonds, and sugar enough to 
sweeten it. Mill for about 10 minutes; put all into a deep 
sieve with a muslin under it to drain. 

Or : — The juice of 1 lemon and the grated rind of 2 to a 
quart of cream ; add sugar, keep stirring it one way until it 
is quite thick. 

FLUM3IERY. 



^ 



87. — Put 3 large handfuls of very small white oatmeal to 
steep a day and night in cold water ; then pour it off clear, 
and add as much more water, and let it stand the same tniie. 
Strain it through a fine hair sieve, and boil it till it be as 
thick as hasty pudding, stirring it well all the time. "When 
first strained, put to it 1 large spoonful of white sugar and 2 
of orange-flower water.' Pour it into shallow dishes, and 
serve to eat with wine, cider, milk, or cream and sugar. It 
Is very good. 

French Flummery. — Boil slowly 2 oz. of isinglass shavings 
in a quart of cream 15 minutes. Stir all the time, and sweeten 
it with loaf-sugar, not pounded, lest any dust should be in it ; 
add a spoonful of rose-water and the same of orange-flower 
water. Strain it into a basin or form, and serve with baked 
pears romid it. 

Mice Flummery. — Boil with a pint of new milk a bit of 



474 lilODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIV. ] 

1 
lernon-peel and cinnamon ; mix with a little cold milk as \ 

much rice-flour as will make the M'hole of a good consistency ; ] 

sweeten, and add a spoonful of peach-water or a bitter almond < 

beaten ; boil it, taking care it does not burn ; pour it into a i 

shape or pint basin, taking out the spice. When cold, turn 

the flummery into a dish, and serve with cream, milk, or 

custard, round. j 

A?i excellent Flummery. — Take 1 pair of calf's feet, boil j 
them in 3 quarts of water till reduced to 1 pint ; wlien cold \ 
take off the fat very carefully ; boil it with a laurel-leaf, add ] 
-i pint of cream with a tablespoonful of orange-flower water. i 
Beat it up till it is as thick as cream ; pour it into cups pre- ^ 
viously laid in cold water, or into a mould. ■ 



JELLIES. 

688. — The chemical compounds so generally advertised for 
making jellies, custards, and blancmange, are worthless in 
comparison with the animal substance of meat, eggs, and 
milk, of which such delicacies ought to be formed ; they are 
not cheaper nor so nutritive, neither do we know of what they 
are composed. 

It is a complaint amongst even experienced housekeepers 
that they cannot feel a certainty of having jelly clear; but by 
strictly attending to the following method for making calf's- 
foot jelly, they can scarcely fail to have it beautifully bright. 

Feet for all jellies are boiled so long by the people who 
sell them that they are less nutritious : they should be pro- 
cured from the butcher and only scalded to take off the hair. 
The liquor will require greater care in removing the fat ; bur. 
the jelly will be far stronger. A little isinglass, h oz. to a 
quart of stock, may be used to secure the firmness, particularly 
in summer. In peeling lemons, care should be taken not to 
cut below the colour, as by so doing a great deal of the 
flavour of the essential oil is lost, and the white part gives a 
disagret«ible flavour. The stock should be measured before it 
gets cold, as the exact quantity cannot be measured when it 
is set. 

Jelly is equally good made of cow-heels nicely cleaned ; 
and they bear a less price than those of calves, and make a 
stronger jelly. 



CHAP. XXIY. JELLIES. 475 

The following mode ^dll greatly facilitate the clearing of 
jelly : — When tlie mixture has boiled 20 minutes, throw m a 
teacupful of cold M-ater ; let it boil 5 minutes longer ; then 
Uike the saucepan off the fire, covered close, and let it stand ^ 
an hour ; after which it will be so clear as to need only once 
running through the bag, and much waste will be sa^ed. 

CALF'S-FO O T JELL Y. 
68 9. — Boil 4 quarts of water, with 3 calf s-feet, or 2 cow- 
lieels, that have been only scalded, till half wasted : take the 
jelly from the fat and sediment; mix with it the juice of a 
Seville orange and 12 lemons, the peels of 3 ditto, the whites 
and shells of 12 eggs, white sugar to taste, a pint of wine, 
? oz. of coriander-seeds, 2 bay-leaves, aiid a bit of cinnamon, 
all bruised, after having previously mixed them cold. The 
jelly should boil up ; then let it stand for 10 minutes, and put 
it through a jelly-bag until it is clear. While running, take 
a little jelly, and mix with a teacupful of water in Avhich a bit 
of beet-root has been boiled, and run it through the bag when 
all the rest is run out ; this is to garnish the other jelly, being 
cooled on a plate : but this is matter of choice. This jelly 
has a very fine high colour and flavour. 

Another. — Boil a cow-heel in 2 quarts of water for 7 or 8 
hours : take every particle of fat and sediment from the jelly ; 
when cold put to it a pint of raisin wine, the juice of 3 
lemons and the rind of 2 pared very thin, about 6 oz. of 
sugar, the whites and shells of 3 eggs well beaten, and \ oz. 
of isinglass. Boil it 20 minutes, then add a teacupful of cold 
water ; let it boil 5 minutes longer, then cover it up close and 
let it stand off the fire i an hour; pour it through a jelly-bag 
until clear, piPt it into a mould, and set it on ice. 

Orange Jelly. — To a pint of calfs-foot stock put a pint of 
strained China orange-juice mixed with that of 1 or 2 lemons ; 
add 6 oz. of sugar, the rinds of 3 oianges and 1 lemon pared 
very thin, the whites and shells of 3 eggs ; mix these well 
together. When it boils, let it simmer i hour ; take it off 
the fire, cover up close, and let it stand 20 minutes, then pour 
it through a bag till clear. In all jellies it is to be under- 
stood the process of clearing should be the same as for calfs- 
foot, already given. 

Lemon Jelly. — Take a quart of calfs-foot stock, add 4 pint 



476 



MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap, XXIY. 



of lemon-juice, -f- lb. of loaf-sugar, the rind of 2 lemons pared 
very thin, the whites and shells of 5 eggs ; boil and clarify as 
already stated. The colour should be bright. For variety, 
any rich white liqueur might be added, taking away an equal 
quantity of lemon-juice. It should be borne in mind that 
lemon-j)eel cut thick does not impart nearly so much flavour 
as the same quantity cut very thin. 

Apple Jelly. — Pour a quart of prepared apple-juice on 1 lb. 
of fresh apples pared and cored ; simmer them until they are 
well broken ; strain the juice, and let it stand until cold. Put 
1-5- pint into a stewpan with a quart of calf's-foot stock, 9 oz. 
of sugar broken small, the rind and juice of 2 lemons, with 
the whites and shells^ of 8 eggs. Let it boil for about J of an 
hour ; strain it through a jelly-bag, and when cool put it into 
moulds. Good baking apples should be used, and the quantity 
of the sugar must vary according to the tartness of the fruit. 

Fruit in Jelly. — Prepare a calf's-foot jelly ; before putting 

it into the mould pick, wash, 
and drain on a cloth some fine 
pine strawberries, some large 
white raspberries, and bunches 
of red and white currants. Lay 
at the bottom of the mould a 
large bunch of white currants 
surrounded with pine straw- 
berries ; on these a layer of 
white raspberries and red cur- 
rants. Cover them entirely 
with jelly ; when quite firm 
arrange another layer of fruit, and so on till the mould is 
filled. Just before wanted dip the mould into warm water for 
a moment, wipe it, and turn the jelly out. The fruits may be 
varied according to the season. Preserved fruits may be used, 
but the colour will not be so fine as fresh fruit. 

TO CLARIFY ISINGLASS. 

690. — Ta'ke 2 oz. of isinglass, pour on it a pint of spring 
water which has been mixed with* a teaspoonful of beaten 
white of Qg^ and a tablespoonful of lemon-juice. Stir them 
thoroughly together, and let them heat slowly, taking care 
the isinglass does not stick to the bottom of the pan ; simmer 




Chap. XXIV. JELLIES. 477 

a few minutes, clear off the scum till iio more appears ; strain 
it through muslin, and set it by for use : it will be trans- 
parent, and may be warmed and mixed v/ith the clear juice 
of any kind of fruit already sweetened, or Math syrup in jellies 
flavoured with liqueur. As a portion of the isinglass is taken 
up by the white of egg, i to each oz. should be allowed for 
this. The finest sort of isinglass, which should be white and 
without any smell, does not require to be clarified, excepting 
for clear jellies ; for all other purposes it is enough to dis- 
solve and skim it, and to pass it through a strainer. A great 
variety of excellent jellies may be made with clarified isinglass 
and the juice or syrup of almost any kind of fresh fruit, the 
colour of wliich is best preserved by mashing it lightly and 
strewing pounded sugar over it, letting it stand 3 or 4 hours 
for the juice to drain off; pour a little water over, and use the 
juice without boiling. This can only be done when fruit is 
plentiful, as it requires double the quantity. It is also a great 
improvement to these jellies to put the moulds into ice 3 or 4 
hours before they are served. It will not be necessary to give 
more than a few receipts, as the process is the same in all. 

ISINGLASS JELLIES. 

m 

691. — Straioberry Jelly. — If the fruit is not very abundant, 
boil f lb. of loaf-sugar in a pint of water for 20 minutes ; pour 
this boiling hot over a quart of picked scarlet strawberries ; 
let them stand all night. Clarify 2^ oz. of isinglass in a pint 
of water ; drain the syrup from the strawberries, adding a 
teacupful of red-currant juice and the juice of a lemon. When 
the isinglass is nearly cold, mix all together ; add more sugar 
if wanted, then put it into moulds. The juice extracted from 
the fruit by laying sugar upon it gives the jelly a finer flavour 
than pouring boiling water upon it. Put the moulds into an 
earthen pan, and cover them with ice broken small. 

Strawberry and raspberry jelly, when no currants are added, 
should have the flavour heightened by a little lemon-juice. 

Orange Jelly. — Boil 1^ oz. of isinglass in a pint of water 
with the peel of -j a lemon ; squeeze the juice of 8 China and 
4 Seville oranges through a sieves add to it the isinglass 
strained, and 6 oz. of pounded sugar. Set it on the fire, stir it 
well till it almost boils ; when nearly cold, put it into earthen- 
ware moulds which have lain in cold water for 2 or 3 hours. 

Lemon Jelly. — Clarify \h oz. of isinglass in a pint of 



nS MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEHY. Chap. XXIV J 

water ; add ^ lb, of loaf-su^ar, and the rind of 2 lemons cut , 
very thin. Squeeze the juice of 4 lemons ; strain it througli I 
blotting- or filtering paper, then stir it into the cool sugar and i 
isinglass : take out the peel, and pour it into cups or forms, | 
and place them in ice. j 

Currant and llaspherry Jelly. — Take 3 lbs. of ripe cur- ; 
rants, of which let one-third be white, and a few red rasj)- | 
berries to give it flavour; break them with a silver fork ; put j 
them into ajar, which put into a saucepan of boiling water, so 
as to draw the juice : boil 2 oz. of isinglass in -f pint of water, j 
to which add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar ; when cool, strain the fruit, j 
and add an equal quantity of the juice ; mix well together, j 
and put it into a mould, and place it in ice to freeze. 

Italian Jelly is made by half filling the mould, and, when i 
the jelly is set, laying round upon it a wreath of stiff blanc- i 
mange, cut of equal size with a small round cutter ; then fill ' 
up the mould with jelly nearly cold. i 

Hartshorn Jelly. — Simmer 8 oz. of hartshorn shavings witii ] 
2 quarts of water to 1 ; strain it and boil it with the rinds of j 
4 China oranges and 2 lemons pared tliin ; when cool add the ! 
^iuice of both, \ lb. of sugar, and the whites of 6 eggs beaten i 
to a froth ; let the jelly have 3 or 4 boils without stirring, and ■ 
strain it through a jelly-bag. j 

Cranberry Jelly. — Make a very strong isinglass jelly. \ 
When cold, mix it with a double quantity of cranberry-juice. ! 
Sweeten and boil it up ; tiien strain it into a shape. i 

The sugar must be good loaf, or the jelly will not be clear. ! 

Cranberry and Rice Jelly.- — Boil and press the fruit, strain ■ 
the juice, and by degrees mix into it as much ground rice as i 
will, when boiled, thicken to a jelly ; boil it gently, stirring it, * 
And sweeten it to your taste. Put it in a basin or form, and j 
.serve with cream. % 

JELLY MOULDS. I 

692. — The shape of the moulds used for jellies and creams .j 
is a matter of importance in the appearance of the entremeti? j 
r)f a handsome dinner. They should be high and nearly of ' 
the same size. If jelly or cream sinks flat on the dish, it has ' 
a poor and shabby appearance. The variety now to be got at 1 
all the large ironmongers' shops is very great, some of them j 
very elegant. The cylindrical mould shows the transparency \ 
of jelly beautifully, the centre being filled up with a liglit

vvliipped cream aftei- the jelly is dished, which not only sets 
off' the jelly, but is very good eaten with it. Also one for 
jellies oi mixed colours, which is very pretty. These are filled 
with the jelly, coloured, and each layer allowed to get cold 
before the next is added. A little cochineal or sliced beet- 
root, with a few drops of lemon-juice, makes a beautiful red ; 
spinach-juice, boiled with a small quantity of water to take off

CONFECTIONERY. 

G93. — Stove. — In storerooms, or wliere there is not a char- 
coal stove for the purpose of preserving, the small portable 
hVench stove is found very convenient. A tin, with the 
sides a little turned up, 
should be placed under it ; 
and there should be a free 
ventilation of air, as the 
best fuel for it is charcoal. 
It is lighted in the same 
way as a charcoal stove, 
by putting upon the bars a 
piece of ciiarcoal already 
ignited ; and may be put 
out by fixing the lid closely 
down. The French call it 
nn Fourncau Economique. 
The original price is only 
ci few shillings.

TO CLARIFY AND BOIL SUGAR. i 

. ^ 

694. — The boiling of sugar more or less constitutes the chief ^ 

art of the confectioner. Those who are not experienced in this, i 
and only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not a^are l 
that in 2 or 3 minutes a syrup over the fire will pass from one i 
gradation to another, called by the confectioners " degrees of 
boiling," of which there are 6, and those subdivided. Such ' 
minutise cannot, however, be attended to by private parties ; ' 
and the observation is only made to guard against both under- 
boiling, which prevents preserves from keeping, and too quick ] 
and lon^ boiling, which brings them to a candy. ' 

The finest sugar should be used in confectionery, as it j 
requires less clarifying, and consequently less is wasted ; the j 
coarser sorts lose much in that process. Break the sugar into j 
large lumps, and put it into a preserving-pan. If for syrup, j 
add a pint of cold water to each pound ; if for candying, a j 
couple of wineglassfuls to the pound will be sufficient. Beat ' 
the white of an egg, add it to the ^vater, mix it well, and pour ; 
it over the sugar ; 1 egg is enough for 12 lbs. of sugar if it is \ 
fine, or 2 if it is coarse. When the sugar is nearly melted, ' 
stir it well, and put it over a gentle fire ; do not stir it after ,| 
the scum begins to rise ; let it boil 5 minutes, then take it off \ 
the fire, let it stand a minute or two, then take the scum care- i 
fully off; put the pan again on the fire, and when the syrup i 
begins to boil throw in a little cold water, which should be ! 
kept back for the purpose ; boil till the scum rises, draw it off 
the fire, and skim it as before ; repeat this till quite clear ; it ] 
is then fit for use. It is by long boiling that the different : 
degrees are obtained which the confectioner requires. When j 
it is fit for candying, it may be drawn out into threads by | 
taking a little between the thumb and finger ; but for barley- '• 
sugar, or caramel, the way to prove it is by dropping a little , 
into cold water ; if it snap between the teeth without sticking j 
to them, it should then be instantly taken off the fire. If for ; 
barley-sugar, a few drops of essence of lemon should be added, \ 
then pour it upon a broad dish, and when the edges begin to ^ 
harden roll it up into sticks. If for caramel, or spun sugar, J 
oil a mould and draw out the sugar in threads over it, let it ■ 
cool, then place it over the fruit or tart it is intended to cover. 
The various degrees in sugar-boiling, if required to a nicety, \ 
may best be ascertained by means of a very simple saccharo- 



Chap. XXV. rRESERYED FEUITS. 48o 

TO PRESERVE FRUIT FOR TARTS. 
700. — Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, 
gather Avheu ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold a 
pound ; strev.' over each jar 6 oz. of good loaf-sugar pounded ; 
cover v.ith 2 bladders each, separately tied down; then set 
the jars in a larg-e stewpan of water up to the neck, and let it 
boil 3 hours gently. Keep these and all other sorts of fruit 
free from damp. 

TO PRESERVE APRICOTS. 

701. — Green Apricots. — Prick the apricots, cover tlie bottom 
of a preserving-pan with vine-leaves, fill the pan with apricots 
and cold spring water, laying more vine-leaves on the top. 
Put them over a slow fire luitil they turn yellow ; then take 
them off, and wipe them well with a flannel and a little salt, 
and put them over the fire in the same vvater to green them. 
Have ready a thin syrup ; boil the apricots up in it once, and 
repeat the process on the 2 following days. Drain them from 
the syrup, and, rendering it strong with sugar, boil them again 
in the thick syrup, and put them b}' for use. Peaches, necta- 
rines, &c., may be preserved the same way. 

Ripe Apricots. — Having pared the apricots, thrust out the 
stones with a skewer, and take the same weight of loaf-sugar 
as of fruit ; strew a part of the sugar over the apricots, and 
let them stand till next day ; then boil them up gently 3 or 4 
different times, adding the kernels to the syrup. Let them 
cool between each boiling, then take them out of the syrup 
carefully one by one ; boil the syrup with all the sugar, skim 
it carefully, then pour it over the apricots, and tie them dowii 
close with a paper and bladder. 

A beautiful Preserve of Apricots. — When ripe, choose the 
finest apricots ; pare them as thin as possible, and weigli them ; 
lay them in halves on dishes, with the hollow part upwards ; 
liave ready an equal weight of good loaf-sugar, finely pounded, 
and strew it over them ; in the mean time break the stones and 
blanch the kernels. When the fruit has lain 12 hours, put it, 
with the sugar, juice, and kernels, into a preserving-pan ; let 
it simmer very gently till clear, then take out the pieces of 
apricst singly, put them into small pots, and pour the syrup 
and kernels over them. The scum must be taken off as it 
^ioes. Cover with paper. 



/ 



486 MODErvX DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XX\^ 

Apricots in Jelly. — Pare the fruit very thin, and stone it ; 
weigh an equal quantity of sugar in fine powder, and strew 
over it. Next day boil very gently till they are clear, move 
them into a bowl, and pour the liquor over. The following- 
day pour the liquor to a quart of codling-liquor ; let it boil 
quickly till it will jelly ; put the fruit into it, and give 1 boil ; 
skim well, and put into small pots. 

To dry Apricots ivhole or in halves. — Take them before 
they are fully ripe, scald them in a jar plunged into boiling 
water, tlien pare them and take out the stones ; put them into 
a syrup of half their weight of sugar, in proportion of 1 pint of 
water to 4 lbs. of sugar ; let them scald awhile, and then boil 
until they are clear. Let them stand for 2 days in the syrup, 
and tiien put them into a thin candy, and scald, but not boil, 
them in it. Keep them 2 days longer in the candy, heating 
them each day, and then lay them on glasses to dry. 

APPLE JELLY TO USE FOR OTHER FRUIT. 

702. — Pour into a stewpan a quart of cold water ; throw into 
it, as quickly as they can be peeled, cored, and weighed, 4 lbs. 
of good boiling apples of fine flavour — codlings are the best ; 
stew them till the fruit is well broken ; strain through a jelly- 
bag; to every quart of this juice allow 1^ lb. of sugar. This 
makes a beautiful jelly to preserve other fruits in. 

TO PRESERVE RIPE PEACHES.— E. R. 

703. — October is the best month, as they are then harder 
and larger. Put them into a preserving-pan full of cold water, 
with a slice or two of lemon ; set them on a slow fire ; have 
ready a sieve and a napkin ; be careful not to do them too 
much : some will be ready sooner tlian others. When they 
begin to be soft they are done enough : drain them on the 
sieve, and let them stand until cold ; then put them into 
glasses : pound sugarcandy very fine in a mortar, dissolve it in 
brandy, and fill up the glasses with it. 

Or : — Wipe, weigh, and pick the fruit, and have ready a 
quarter of the weight of fine sugar in fine powder. Put the 
fruit into an icepot that shuts very close ; throw the sugar over 
it, and then cover the fruit with brandy. Between the top and 
cover of the pot put a piece of double whity-brown paper. Set 
tiie pot in a saucepan of water till the brandy be as hot as you 
can bear to put your finger into, but it must not boil. Put the 



CuAF. XXV. PEESERYED FRUITS. 487 



fruit into a jar, and pour the brandy upon it. When cold put 
a bladder over it, and tie it down tight. 

TO PRESERVE NECTARINES —E. R. 
704. — Split the fruit, take out the stones, and put the nec- 
tarines into clarified sugar till they take it well. Skim the 
liquor, cover the nectarines with paper, and set them by until 
the next day. Add sugar to the syrup, boiling it until it will 
How ; put in the nectarines, give them a good boil, skim, cover 
them, and lay them on a stove. The next day take them out 
of the sugar," drain them, place them separately, dusting sugar 
over them ; the next day put them on the stove or into a cool 
oven to dry. 

TO PRESERVE A MELON.— E. R. 
705. — Scrape off the thin outside skin, make a hole in the 
top, take out the seeds ; then throw the melon into water, and 
after it has remained 12 hours take it out and put it into a 
preserving-pan, with a large piece of loaf-sugar and as much 
water as will cover it ; then cover the pan closely, and let it 
remain for an hour on a very slow fire. Repeat this process 
3 times, on 3 successive days, taking care not to allow it to 
boil ; make a thin syrup, drain the melon carefully out of the 
liquor, and put it into the syrup, set it over a slow fire closely 
covered for i an hour every day for 3 ensuing days, on the 
last day boiling the syrup until it is very rich, with the rind of 
1 , and the juice of 2 lemons. To improve the flavour of a 
melon, take it when nearly ripe, cut out so much of the large 
end as to permit the scooping out of the seeds ; then fill up the 
hollow with water and sugar, or white wine ; close the top, put 
the melon in a net exposed to the sun for as many days as it 
remains good. A water melon will thus acquire a fine flavour ; 
but a musk melon requires no improvement. 

Or : — Take a melon, cut it into pieces as for eating, trim of? 
the outer rind, freely dust it over with fine sugar, and 12 hours 
after put it in a preserving-pan with sufficient syrup to cover it ; 
i)oil it gently until tender, repeat the boiling for 3 successive 
days, when the syrup should be thick. 

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES.— E. R. 
706.— Obtain the juice of currants by boiling them in a J2r 
plunged 'n water; to eveiTpint of the currant-liquor add 1 lb. 



488 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXv 

of strawberries and the weight of both in sugar. Break the 
sugar in lumps, dip them in water to dissolve, then boil it v.ith 
the currant-juice, skim it well, then put in the strawberries ; 
let them boil about i of an hour, and put them with the syrup 
into pots. 

To preserve Strawberries whole. — To 1 lb. of picked fruit 
add f lb. of pounded lump-sugar. Lay part of it upon the 
fruit, and let it remain until the next day ; put the remainder 
of the sugar and a pint of currant-juice to every lb. of straw- 
berries into a preserving-pan, and boil to a syrup ; add the 
strawberries, and simmer very gently till the fruit is soft, being 
careful not to break it ; take out the strawberries, and boil the 
syrup until it appears to be rich. Wait until it is cold, and 
then put it upon the fruit. 

A rich ivay of preserving Strawberries. — In picking the 
strawberries reserve the largest kinds ; then boil the smaller 
ones, allowing f lb. of fine sugar to 1 lb. of fruit ; stir it while 
boiling, and make it into jam. Make a fine syrup of sugar, 
and boil the larger strawberries in it, taking great care that 
they be kept separate, and do not break. Take them out, and 
put them into small preserving-pots ; then boil the syrup and 
the jam together until it is very rich, or make it into a jelly by 
straining it, and pour it on the strawberries when nearly cold. 
Choose the largest scarlets, or others, when not dead ripe. lu 
either of the above ways they eat well served in thin cream \ii 
glasses. 

To preserve Straivberries in Wine. — Put a quantity of the 
finest large strawberries into a gooseberry-bottle, and strew 
over them 3 large spoonfuls of line sugar ; fill up with Madeira 
wine or sherry. 

TO PRESER VE RHUBARB. 
*tOl. — To li lb. of rhubarb add 1 lb. of sugar, ^ oz. of 
bitter almonds blanched and chopped very fine, ^ the peel of a 
lemon also chopped very fine. Boil all together rather 
longer than other fruit, or till it will set firm. If the fruit is 
not quite young, the sticks should be peeled, being first wiped 
quite dry. 

TO PRESERVE ORANGES OR LE3I0NS IN JELLY. 

708.— Cut a hole at the stalk the size of a shilling, and witli 
? Gaiall blunt knife scrape out the pulp quite cleai', without 



Chap. XXV. PEESEEYED FRUITS. 48S 

cutting the rind, and lay them in sj^ring water 2 days, chang- 
ing it twice a-day ; in the last, boil them tender on a slow fire, 
keeping them covered. To every lb. of fruit take 2 lbs. of 
double-refined sugar and 1 pint of water ; boil these with the 
juice of the orange to a syrup, and clarify it ; skim, well, ana 
let it stand to be cold ; then boil the fruit in the syrup ^ an 
hour ; if not clear, do this daily till they are done. 

TO KEEP ORANGES OR LEMONS FOR PASTRY. 

709. — When you have squeezed the juice, throw the peels 
into salt and water ; let them remain a fortnight ; clean out 
the pidp ; boil them till tender, strain them, and when they 
are tolerably dry boil a small quantity of syrup of common 
loaf-sugar and water, and put over them ; in a week boil them 
gently in it till they look clear. 

TO PRESERVE WHOLE OR HALF QUINCES. 
710. — Into 2 quarts of boiling water put a quantity of the 
fairest golden pippins, in slices not very thin, and not pared, 
but wiped clean. Boil them very quickly, close covered, till 
the water becomes a thick jelly ; then scald the quinces. To 
every pint of pippin-jelly put 1 lb. of the finest sugar ; boil 
it, and skim it clear. Put those quinces that are to be done 
whole into the syrup at once, and let it boil very fast ; and 
those that are to be in halves by themselves ; skim it, and 
when the fruit is clear put some of the syrup into a glass to try 
v/hether it jellies before taking it off the fire. The quantity of 
quinces is to be 1 lb. to 1 lb. of sugar, and 1 lb. of jelly already 
boiled with the sugar. 

TO PRESERVE PEARS. 
711. — Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin syrup ; let 
them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and simmer 
again, and repeat this till they are clear ; then drain and dry 
them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. They may 
be kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which makes them more 
moist and rich. Jargonelles are the best for this purpose. 

To hake Pears. — These need not be of a fine sort ; but 
some taste better than others, and often those that are least 
fit to eat raw. Wipe, but do not pare, and lay them on tin 
pla tes, and bake them in a slow oven. When soft enough to 
bear it, fatten them with a silver spoon. When done through, 

y3 



490 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXY 

put them on a dish. They should be baked 3 or 4 times, and 
veiy gently. 

To steiv Pears. — Pare and halve or quarter large pears, 
according to their size ; tlu'ov/ them into water, as the skin is 
taken off, before thej'" are divided, to prevent their turning 
black. Pack them round a block-tin stewpan, and sprinkle as 
much sugar over as will make them pretty sweet, and add 
lemon-peel, a clove or two, and some allspice cracked ; just 
cover them with vv^ater, and add a little red vdne. Cover them 
close and stew 3 or 4 hours ; when tender, take them out, and 
strain the liquor over them. 

TO PRESERVE SIBERIAN CRABS.~E. R. 

712. — Bub the fruit with a dry flannel, taking care not to 
break the skin. Prick each \n\h a needle all over to prevent 
its bursting. Boil 1 lb. of sugar in a pint of water, then put 
m the fruit and boil it until the skin begins to crack slightly ; 
then take up the crabs, drain them separately upon a dish ; 
boil the syrup again, and if not strong enough add more sugar ; 
when cold pour it over the fruit, which must be put into jars, 
tied down closely, and kept in a cool diy place. 

Another way. — Boil a pint of water and 1^ lb. of refined 
sugar to a fine clear syrup ; skim it, and let it become cold. 
Pare the crabs ; and to this quantity of syrup put 1 lb. of fruit, 
and simmer slowly till tender. Carefully remove each apple 
separately, and pour the syrup over when a little cooled, add 
orange and lemon peel boiled tender. 

BIFFINS. 

The Red Biffin, or the Minshul Crab, are the best sorts 
for drying. 

713. — Take the Red Biffin apple, and put them into a cool 
oven 6 or 7 tunes, flattening them gently by degrees when 
they are soft enough to bear it. If the oven should be hot 
they will waste ; and they ought to be put at first into a very 
cool one. They are prepared in the same manner in France, 
and when stewed either in milk or v/ine are very good. 

TO PRESERVE MAGNUM BONUM PLUMS.— E. R. 
714. — Set them over a slow fire in spring water until they 
will peel, keeping them under the water ; peel and put them 
into ajar with a thin syrup, which must cover them, or other- 



Chap. XXY. PKESEEVED FRUITS. ■ 491 

wise they will be discoloured. The next day boil tlie syrup, 
llien put in the plunis, and give them a gentle boil. Let them 
stand until cold ; then repeat the process ; turn them in the 
syi'up until nearly cold. Take out the plums, strain the sjTup, 
add more sugar, and skim it v/ell ; put in the plunis, boil them 
till they r^re clear, then cover with paper. 

O?' : — Prick them v/ith a needle to prevent bursting, sim- 
mer them very gently in thin syrup, put them in a china 
bowl, and v.hen cold pour it over. Let them lie 3 days ; then 
make a syrup of 3 lbs. of sugar to 5 of fruit, with no more 
water tha,n Iiangs to large lumps of the sugar dipped quickly 
and instantly brought out. Boil the plums in this fresh syrup 
after draining the first from them. Do them very gently till 
tliey are clear and the syrup adheres to them. Put them one 
by one into small pots, and pour the lifjuor over. If any are 
to be dried, keep a little of the syrup in the pan, and boil it 
quickly : then give the fruit one warm more, drain, and put 
them to dry on plates in a cool oven. These plums are apt to 
ferment if not boiled in two syrups ; the iirst syrup will sweeten 
pies, but will have too much acid to keep. You may reserve 
part of it, and add a little sugar, to do those that are to dry; 
for they will not require to be so sweet as if kept wet. Do 
not break them. One pp^rcei may be done after another, and 
save much sug:ar. 

To Dry. — Take the weight of the plums in sugar, wrap each 
plum in a vine-leaf, put them into a stewpan covered with 
water, and set them on a slow lire to scald. Vv'hen sufficiently 
done take them out and lay them in a bowl or deep dish, pound 
the sugar, and put it on them ; the following day pour the 
syrup off, and boil it, and put it on the plums ; this do everj' 
day for 4 or 5 days ; then take the plums out of the syrup, siit 
sugar over them, lay them upon tins, and diy them in a cool 
oven or before the fire. 

A common Preserve of Plums. — Put the plums into a jar 
large enough to hold 1 lb. of fruit, add 7 oz. of good moist 
sugar ; tie the jar over vvith 2 bladders tied separately ; place 
ihe jar in a kettle of cold water up to the bladders ; do not 
cover the kettle, and let them boil in the water for 3 hours. 

TO FRF SERVE GREENGAGES.~E. R. 
VI 5. — Pick and prick all the plums ; put them into a nre* 



192 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEllY. Chap. XXV. 

serving-pan with coM water enough to cover them. Let them 
remain on the fire until the water simmers well ; then take oiT, 
and allow them to stand until half cold, putting the jDlums to 
drain. To every lb. of plums allow 1 lb. of sugar, which must 
be boiled in the water from which the plums have been taken ; 
let it boil very fast until the syrup drops short from the spoon, 
skimming carefully all the time. When the sugar is suffi- 
ciently boiled put in the plums, and allow them to boil until 
the sugar covers the pan with large bubbles. Then pour the 
whole into a pan, and let them remain until the following day. 
Drain the syrup from the plums as dry as possible, boil it up 
quickly, and pour it over the plums ; then set them by ; do 
this a third and a fourth time. On the fifth day, when the 
syrup is boiled, put the plums into it, and let them boil for a 
few minutes ; then put them into jars. Should the greengages 
be over ripe, it will be better to make jam of them, using 
^ lb. of sugar to 1 lb. of fruit. Warm the jars before putting 
the sv\'eetmeats in, and be careful not to boil the sugar to a 
candy. 

TO PRESERVE GOOSEBERRIES. 
716. — Take the rough-skinned fruit when quite dry, with 
rather more than their weight of sugar pounded fine ; lay a 
iayer of fruit and a layer of sugar till all are in the pan ; add 
a teacupful of water, and boil the fruit quickly till it is clear ; 
take it out and put it into jars ; boil up tlie syrup till it is 
tliick, then pour it over the fruit. When cold cover close with 
pasted or egged paper. 

3IAR3IALADES. 

717. — Apricot. — Gather the fruit before it is too ripe, stone 
and blanch the kernels. To every lb. of fruit take f lb. of 
fine loaf-sugar : break the sugar into lumps, dip the lumps in 
water, allow them to dissolve, put it over a clear fire, and let 
it boil to a candy ; then pound and sift it ; pare the fruit, cut 
it into thin slices, put them with the sugar over a slow fire, let 
it simmer till clear, but do not boil it ; add the kernels, and 
then put the marmalade into jars. 

Or : — Boil ripe apricots in syrup until they will mash ; beat 
them in a mortar : tJike -j their weight in loaf-sugar, and si,iifi- 
cient water to dissolve it ; boil all together, and skim until it 
is clear, and the syrup thick like fine jelly. 

Apple. — Pare and core any kind of good boiling apples. 



OiiAP. XXr. PKESERYED FEUITS. 493 

To every 4 lbs. add 1 pint of cold water. Cover them close 
ill the preserving-pan, and let them boil till the fruit will 
mash with a fork. To every lb. of fruit put |- lb. of loaf- 
sugar. Keep the marmalade well stinted to prevent its burn- 
ing-, and let it boil till it will set firm. 

Common moist sugar is sometimes employed for family use. 

Qiihice. — Pare and quarter the fruit, put it in layers in a 
stone jar with sugar sprinkled between each ; add a teacupful 
of water, and bake it in a cool oven. Have a quantity of 
sugar equal in weight to the fruit ; allow 1 quart of water to 
every 4 lbs. ; boil the sugar and water together, skimming it 
well. When the quinces are soft add them, with a quart of 
the juice which will be found in the jar : boil them in the 
syrup, beating it with a spoon until the marmalade is quite 
smooth. 

Another way. — Pare and quarter quinces, weigh an equal 
quantity of sugar ; to 4 lbs. of the latter put 1 quart of water, 
boil and skim, and have it ready whilst 4 lbs. of quinces are 
made tolerably tender by the following mode : — Lay them in 
a stone jar with a teacupful of water at the bottom, and pack 
them with a little sugar strewed between ; cover the jar close, 
and set it on a stove or cool oven, and let them soften till tlie 
colour become red ; then pour the fruit-syrup and 1 quart of 
quince-juice into a preserving-pan, and boil all together till 
the marmalade is completed, breaking the lumps of fruit with 
a wooden fork. 

This fruit is so hard that if it be not done as above it requires 
a great deal of time. 

Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing them through 
a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining the juice to add 
as above : dip the cloth in boiling water first and wring it. 

A very Jine Orange Marmalade. — Take 50 Seville oranges 
and 12 lemons; have their weight in loaf-sugar; grate the 
oranges slightly all over to take av/ay the bitterest part of the 
peel, cut the rind all round, and with a spooii separate it from 
the fruit without breaking the edge ; boil the peel in 2 separate 
waters 20 minutes each time ; the first water should be cold, 
the second boiling. The peel should be shred in extremely 
thin slices ; separate the seeds and every bit of skin from the 
pnlp ; then mash it in a marble mortar ; boil the sugar till it 
is a clear syrup ; having dipped the lumps into cold water, add 



494 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXY. 

tlie pulp and juice ; let it boil i of an hour ; then add th& 
shred peel; let it boil till tender. The peel only of the 
lemons is used ; the lemons will do for lemon-pickle. 

Or : — Weigh the oranges ; to 6 lbs. of fruit allow 9 lbs. of 
raw or 6 lbs. of good refined sugar ; boil the oranges whole 
till you can pierce them witli a stra\v. Then cut them in 
quarters, take the seeds out of the pulp, and scrape the white 
under skin from the peel. Slice or mince the oranges, put 
the sugar with a little water into a pan ; and when dissolved 
put the whole together, and let it boil on a slow fire until it 
becomes of a proper consistency. 

Orange Marmalade for Puddings. — Take 12 Seville 
oranges, boil them till quite tender, changing the water 2 or 
3 times, take out the seeds, pulp, and inner skin of the rind ; 
beat the outer rind in a marble mortar very fine ; add to it the 
pulp and juice ; to every lb. of this add 2 lbs. of fine moist 
sugar ; mix it all well together ; put it into a larger jar than 
will hold it, as it ferments a little at first. It will keep for 
years, and no boiling is necessary. If made for breakfast it 
Icolis prettier when made with loaf-sugar. 

Transparent. — Cut the palest Seville oranges in quarters ; 
take the pulp out and put it in a basin ; pick out the seeds and 
skins. Let the outsides soak in water v/ith a little salt all 
night, then boil them in a good quantity of spring water till 
tender ; drain, and cut them in very thin slices, and put them 
to the pulp ; add to every lb. \\ lb. of double-refined sugar 
beaten fine ; boil them together 20 minutes, but be careful not 
to break the slices. If not quite clear, simmer 5 or 6 minutes 
longer. It must be stirred all the time very gently. When 
cold, put it into glasses. 

Mixed. — Split and stone 4 dozen plums, blanch the kernels, 
and pound them in a mortar with a little rose-water ; pa,re 
£nd core 2 dozen pears and the same number of apples ; put 
them into a jar v.'ith a little sugar, but no water. Bake them 
in a cool oven. Beat them well in a preserving-pan, stir in 
3 lbs. of sugar, and boil them 1 hour ; put the marmalade into 
small deep dishes, and dry it gently in a cool oven. 

Scotch. — Take 6 or 8 lbs. of Seville oranges, pare off the 
skins thinly, so that there shall be as little as possible of the 
v/hite portion ; cut the parings into strips or chips, and cut 
them across again into very small pieces. Put them into 3 



Chap. XXY. PEESERVED FRUITS. 49-5 

pan with as much water as will cover them, boil them for 1 
horn', then strain them through a sieve, and lay them aside. 
I^ext quarter the oranges, and scrape out the pulp and juice 
into a dish, throwing away the white skins, films, and seeds ; 
put the whole into a pan, together with 7 or 8 lbs. of sugarj 
according to the original -weight of the oranges ; let the whole 
boil for ^ an hour ; skim it, and pour it into pans for use. 

It may be observed that, although this marmalade should 
be made entirely . of Seville oranges, yet a few, if mixed with 
the common sorts, are sufficient to give the necessary flavour, 
and in that manner is made all that is sold in the shops as 
*' Scotch marmalade^ 

COMPOTES, 

718. — Orange. — Lay the oranges in vrater for 4 hours, then 
Iwil them till tender, cut them in halves, and take out all the 
insides ; to every lb. of peel well pounded add 1 lb. of sugar ; 
then take all the skins and seeds out of the pulp, add its weight 
of sugar, and beat it well ; then mix it with the peel, and beat 
it again in a mortar, and pot it for use. 2 dozen sweet 
Lisbon oranges will make a large jar of paste : it will keep 
good for severa,l years in j)ots covered with paper. 

B.ed Currant. — Boil h lb. of sugar in -V pint of water for 
15 minutes; simmer a quart of picked currants in it for 10 
minutes. 

Kaspberries, cherries, gooseberries, rhubarb, or almost any 
sort of fruit, may be prepared in the same proportions, only 
varying the quantity of sugar according to the acidity of the 
fruit. These compotes will be found excellent served with 
batter, bread, ground rice, or any other puddings, or with a 
little custard or cream. 

Apple. — Take a dozen fine rennets, peel and core them, but 
do not divide them ; put them into a wide-necked jar, strew 
amongst them some thinly shred lemon-peel, and put 1 lb. of 
fine moist sugar upon them. When the apples are very ripe 
add a little lemon-juice ; put in ^ pint of water ; cover the jar 
close, and bake slowly. They may be served lot, with the 
juice poured over them ; or, when cold, fur dessert, or for a 
corner dish, with a custard poured round them. 

Take off the peel with a knife, cut each orange in half, 
sprinkle them with sugar, and Jet them just warm through ; 
peel very thin, witJiout any of the white, two oranges, and 



496 MO'DERX DOirESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXY. 

boil this peel in the syrup until it is tender ; pile up the fruit 
high, and put the peel on the top, and pour the syrup over. 

TO DRY CURRANTS FOR DESSERT.— E. R. 

719. — Have a basin of water and dissolve in it a sufficient 
quantity of gum- Arabic to make it rather thick ; have also a 
plateful of the best loaf-sugar, pounded and sifted. Dip 
bunches of ripe red currants into the gum- Arabic solution, 
and then roll them well in the sugar : lay them separately on 
a dish to dry in the sun. They are very pretty for dessert, to 
be eaten immediately ; if kept, care must be taken that the 
bunches do not touch, and the process should be repeated by 
rolling them in sugar for several days successively. 

BARBERRY CAKES..— E. R. 

720. — Pick the barberries and weigh them ; to every lb. of 
fruit add 1 lb. of sugar pounded and sifted. Bruise the bar- 
berries in a mortar, boil them gently till nearly all the juice 
is consumed, then take them off' the fire and stir in the sugar 
by degrees ; drop the fruit on earthen dishes to dry : it nmst 
not be put over the fire after the sugar is in, nor must tliere be 
any water used. Do not pound the barberries too small, as 
the cakes will not look so well. 

Currant cakes may be made in the same way. 

FRUIT WAFERS FOR DESSERT.— E. R. 

721. — Take currants, cherries, apricots, or any other fruit; 
put them into an earthen jar in a kettle of water, and when 
scalded strain them through a sieve. To every pint of juice 
add the same weight of finely sifted sugar and the white of a 
small egg. Beat all together until it becomes quite thick, 
then put it upon buttered paper in a slow oven : let them 
remain until they will quit the paper, then turn them, and 
leave them in the oven until quite dry ; cut them into shapes 
and keep them between paper in a. box near the fire. 

G OSES ERR Y CHEESE. 
722. — Gather the rough red gooseberries when quite ripe ; 
bake them ; pass them through a hair sieve ; boil them gently. 
To every lb. of gooseberries put 3 oz. of sugar, which should 
be strewed in every now and then, a little at a time. It will 
take several hours to boil, in order to obtain the proper 
ihickness. 



Chap. XXV. PKESEEVED FRUITS. 497 

To dry Gooseberries. — Put 5 lbs. of gooseberries into a 
stewpan, and strew over them 1 lb. of sugar ; set them on a 
slow fire ; when the syrup begins to come out take them off ; 
scald them in this way for 2 or 3 days, then take them out of 
the syrup, place them upon sieves, and put them before the 
fire or in the sun to dry. They may be dipped into powdered 
white sugar when taken out of the syrup, and thus candied. 
They should be laid between paper in tin boxes when put by 
for use. 

CHERRIES.— E. R. 

723. — To Dry. — Weigh the cherries before they are stoned, 
and allow to every lb. of fruit i lb. of lump-sugar ; when they 
are stoned set them over a slow fire to heat, then take them out 
of the liquor and put the sugar to them, and let them stand till 
it is dissolved. Then set them over the fire and let them just 
boil. Allow them to stand for 2 or 3 days in the syrup, and 
again boil them ; afterwards strain them, and spread them on 
sieves to dry, either on a stove or in the sun, or in an oven after 
the bread is drawn. 

The same syrup will do again for more fruit. 

To Dry luithout Sugar. — Stone, and set them over the fire ; 
let them simmer in their own liquor, and shake them in th.e 
pan. Put them to get cold ; next day give them another scald, 
and put them when cold on sieves to dry in an oven of tem- 
perate heat. Twice heating, an hour each time, will do them. 

Put them in a box, with a paper between each layer. 

Preserved in Brandy. — Reserve a fourth portion of tlie 
cherries, clip the stalks of the remainder ; lay them carefully 
in jars, and fill up the jars with brandy, putting no sugar, as 
that would wrinkle them. Then stone the remaining portion, 
boil them with double their weight of sugar, and put them 
aside. When the brandy-cherries are taken out for dessert, 
mix a portion of this preserve with the liquor, and they will 
taste very rich ; or the cherries may be strained and the liquor 
only used, in addition to the brandy from the other cherries. 

Another method. — Weigh the finest morellag, having cut 
off half the stalk ; prick them with a new needle, and drop 
them into a jar or wide-mouthed bottle. Pound i the weight 
of sugar or white candy; strew over; fill up with brandy, aiiJ 
tie a bladder over. 

Moiled Cherries^ which ta^te as if done in Drandy. — To

every 3 lbs. of morella cherries put 1 lb. of double-refinecl < 
sugar, sifted in layers, in a large stone jar or small keg. Stop ' 
it perfectly close, and roll the jar to and fro for a short time i 
every day for 6 weeks. Keep them in a cool place. :i 

When iiitended for Tarts and Puddings. — Take 15 lbs. \ 
of Kentish cherries ; boil, and break them as they boil, and ^ 
when the juice has all boiled away, and the bottom of the pan I 
is visible, put in 3 lbs. of lump sugar finely powdered. Stir i 
the cherries well, and let them have 2 or 3 boils ; then add a 
pint of currant-juice, skim the pot, and take out the stones, ] 
which will rise to the top. This jam will keep until late in 1 
the spring without the addition of any more sugar, and will ] 

make good tarts and puddings. \

724. — Take different kinds of fruit, stone the plums and j 
slice the apples and pears, put them in alternate layers in a \ 
jar ; set them in the oven until they are quite soft ; then pass j 
the pulp through a coarse sieve, and to every lb. of fruit put ' 
a lb. of moist sugar, set it over a slow fire and stir it till very 
thick, then put it into a wide shallow pot and cut it in slices \ 
lor use. Windfalls may be employed for this sort of sweet- i 
meat. \ 

Another. — Put into a pan 4 dozen split plums, 2 dozen | 
apples, and 2 dozen pears, pared thin and cored. Boil them , 
without water. When well blended together, and the stones , 
taken out, stir in 3 lbs. of sugar, and boil them an hour. Put 
it into shallow pans or soup-plates, and dry in the sun or a 
cool oven. 

I>A3IS0^' CHEESE,— E. R. 

725. — Stone the damsons, take out the kernels and blanch 
them ; put the whole into a stone jar and bake it. Pour off a 
part of the juice, put the fruit into a preserving-pan, boil it 
quickly until it looks rather dry. To every 2 lbs. of the 
original quantity of fruit take i lb. of loaf-sugar ; now stir 
the sugar well in, and let it simmer slowly for 2 hours. Then 
boil it again quickly until it begins to candy at the sides of 
the pan Pour the jam into shallow pots not more than an 
inch deep ; cover with brandy-paper, and tie down close. 

Or : — Gather the damsons on a dry day ; bake or boil them 
till the pulp will pass through a coarse hair sieve, then add

iheir weight of moist sugar; boil it U hour, stirring it cou 
tinually to keep it from burning. 

JAMS. 

726. — Raspberry.— Tdke equal weights of fruit and moist 
sugar ; put them on the fire together ; Jieep stirring and break- 
ing the fruit till the sugar melts, then boil till it will jelly on 
a plate. 

Though simple, this will be found a very good receipt. 

Or : — Take equal weight of Iruit and roughly-pounded loaf- 
sugar ; bruise the fruit with the back of a spoon, and boil 
tliem together for ^ an hour; if a little more juice is wanted, 
add the juice of currants drawn as for jelly. 

Grape. — The grapes ought not to be very ripe. They 
should be carefully picked, and all that are at all injured 
should be rejected. To 1 lb. of grapes add ^ lb. of sugar ; 
no water but what hangs about them after they have been 
washed. Put a layer of sugar, then a layer of grapes. Boil 
on a moderate fire, stimng it all the time, to prevent its 
burning. 

CAerry.— Stone 4 lbs. of cherries, and put them in a pre- 
serving-pan with 2 lbs. of fine white sugar and a pint of red- 
currant juice. Boil the whole together rather fast, until it 
stiffens, and then put it into pots for use. 

Gooseberr}j.—^t^\\. and crop 6 lbs. of the small, red, rough 
gooseberry, put them into a preserving-pan, and, as they 
warm, stir and bruise them to bring out the juice. Let them 
boil for 10 minutes, then add 4 lbs. of sugar, and place it on 
the fire again ; let it boil, and continue boiling for 2 hours 
longer, stirring it all the time to prevent its burning. When it 
thickens, and will jelly upon a plate, it is done enough. Put 
It mto pots, and allow it to remain a day before it is covered. 

Blackberry. — In families where there are many children 
there is no preparation of fruit so wholesome, so cheap, and so 
much admired, as this homely conserve. The fruit should be 
clean picked in dry weather, and to every lb. of berries put ^ lb. 
of coarse brown sugar ; boil the whole together for ^ of an hour 
or 1 hour, stirrmg it well the whole time. Put it in pots like 
any other preserve, and it will be found most useful in flimilies, 
as it may be given to children instead of medicine ; makes 
excellent puddings ; and even if the fi'uit be purchased i*n 
London, the cost will not exceed M, per lb 



500 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Cuav.XXV. 

barberry. — Take the barben'ies without stones, pick theia 
from the stalks, take their weight in loaf-sugar, put them into 
a jar, and place it in a kettle of water until the sugar is dis- 
solved and the barberries quite soft. The next day put them 
into a preserving-pan, and boil them for i of an hour. Pat 
them into jars, and keep them in a dry place. 

TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES IN BUNCHES. 

727. — Take the stoneless barberries, reserve the largest 
i)unches ; then pick the rest from the stalks, put them into as 
much water as vviil make a syrup for the bunches, boil them 
until quite soft ; then strain them through a sieve, and to every 
pint of juice put 1^ lb. of loaf-sugar : boil and skim it well. 
To every pint of this syrup put \ lb. of barberries in bunches, 
boil them until they look quite clear, and put them into pots 
or glasses. Tie paper over them. They are only used as a 
garnish for other sweet dishes. 

COMPOSITION S1FEETI,IEAT.—E. R. 
728. — Take 2 pottles of ripe red gooseberries, 2 of red rasp- 
berries, 2 of strawberries (the pines are best), and 3 pints of 
ripe red currants ; bruise and mix them together in a deep 
dish, and to every pint of the fruit put f lb. of sugar, pounded 
pretty fine ; then boil it for ^ an hour, stirring it all the time 
it is on the fire. Cherries may also be added, first taking out 
the stones ; measure them with the other fruit for the weight 
of sugar. 

C URRAN T JELL Y. 

729. — Take of red and white currants equal quantities, or 
all red, tie them down close in a jar, put them into a kettle of 
water over a slow fire to boil for 2 hours, or into a slow oven ; 
strain the liquor through a fine sieve, but do not squeeze the 
currants hard ; then to every pint of juice put -J lb. of loaf- 
sugar ; set it over a very slow fire until the sugar is dissolved. 
Let tlie Fcum rise thick enough to be taken oft" at once ; then 
let it boil up quickly for 20 minutes, or until it jellies. 

Currant Jelly without boiling. — Press the juice from the 
currants, and make it quite hot, but it must not be allowed 
to boil. To each pint of juice add a full lb. of loaf-suga*-, 
pounded very fine, and made quite hot in the oven, and then 
•stiiTed gradually into the hot juice until it is melted. 



Chap. XXY. PRESERVED FRUITS. oOl 

APPLE JELL Y. 

730. — Quarter a peck of codlings, put them into a pre- 
serving-pan with the peel of a lemon, a small piece of cinna- 
mon, and 6 cloves ; add as much spring water as will just 
cover them. Boil the whole to a pulp, then run them througii 
a jelly-bag, and to every pint of juice put -| lb. of good loaf- 
sugar ; boil it fast until it jellies ; then pour it into pots or 
moulds. August is the best time to make this jelly, when tlie 
codlings are full grown, but not ripe. Crabs greatly impro\e 
this jelly, and when they are not to be had a little lemon- 
juice. 

Jelly may be made of any kind of fruit by putting the fruit 
into a preserving-pan with its own weight of sugar, boiling 
and skimming it until it will jelly ; then pour the whole 
through a jelly-bag, but do not press it ; take what remains 
in the bag and boil it \ of an hour for jam, and put the juice 
into another stewpan and boil the same time. This method 
saves the trouble of pressing, and prevents waste. 

MAR3IALADE JELLY. 
731. — To every lb. of Seville oranges put 3 pints of water, 
cut the oranges into quarters, keeping out all iho. seeds ; sepa- 
rate the rind first, and steep it in water 24 hours, or even 
longer, to take off the bitter ; then boil tho peel slowly vritli 
the oranges, till it is tender ; run all through a jelly-bag, and 
to every pint add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, then boil it at least ^ an 
hour. A lemon or 2, cut up with the oranges, is an improve- 
ment. The peel reqnires to be boiled some hours. 

ORANGE SYRUP.— E. R. 
732. — Take the largest, deepest coloured, and roughest 
oranges that can be obtained, grate off the rind very nicely, 
and throw the oranges into water : let them remain 12 hours, 
changing the water once during that time, to take out the 
bitter. This, however, although a common practice, is inju- 
dicious, as the " bitter " of the peel, particularly of Seville 
orange, adds the finest flavour to the syrup. Put them into a 
cloth, and boil them ; when tender cut them in quarters, and, 
after taking out the pulp, throw them into cold water ; make 
a thin syrup, clear them in it, after which enrich the syrup, 
adding the pulp ; make it very thick, and pour it over the 
oranges in jars. The white Wedgev^ood ware are much better 
tlian the common earthen jars. 



502 MODEllX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XMV 

CANDIED ORANGE OR LEMON PEEL.—E. R. 
733. — Take the fruit, cut it lengthwise, remove all the pulp 
and interior skin, then put the peel into strong salt and water 
for 6 days ; then boil them in spring water until they are soft, 
and jilace them in a sieve to drain ; make a thin syrup with a 
lb. of sugar-candy to a quart of water, boil them in it for \ aa 
hour, or till they look clear ; make a thick syrup with sugar 
and as much water as will melt it, put in the peel, and boil 
them over a slow fire until the syrup candies in the pan ; then 
take them out, powder pounded sugar over them, and dry 
them before the fire in a cool oven. 

GINGER SYRUP, 

734. — Take 1 lb. of the best white ginger, break it into 
small pieces, and let it boil in a good quantity of water until 
the water tastes very strongly of the ginger. Then boil any 
sort of solid fruit in the ginger and water until they are nearly 
as tender as M'ould be required for the table ; take them up, 
and lay them in a jar with the ginger and water for 4 or 5 
days, stirring them constantly. Next make a syrup ; to every 
lb. of loaf-sugar put ^ pint of brandy, the peel of a lemon, 
and the juice of t a lemon, with a little of the gingered water. 
When the syrup has been well boiled and tne scum removed, 
put the fruit into it, and let it boil for 10 minutes ; then take 
it off the fire, and allow it to remain for a week ; after which 
drain off' the syrup, and boil it with additional sugar to make 
it sufficiently rich; place the fruit in it, and boil 10 or 15 
minutes longer. 

Place them in pots covered with brandy-paper, and they 
will be fit for use in a month. 

COLOURING, to stain Jellies, Ices, S^^c. 

735. — For a beautiful red, boil 15 grains of cochineal in 
the finest powder, with H dram of cream of tartar, in ^ pint 
of water, very slowly for ^ an hour. Add in boiling a bit of 
alum the size of a pea. Or use beet-root sliced, and some 
liquor poured over. 

Another. — Cochineal 1 oz., cream of tartar 2 oz., alum \ oz. 
Boil the above in a pint of water until reduced one-third ; 
then shake in 1 oz. of America,n ashes when off the fire ; 
strain through a napkin, and bottle for use.

CHAPTER XXYL 
PICKLES AND FAMILY SAUCES. 

736. — Although meat, when cured and dried, is called 
'•' pickled," yet in that operation salt alone is employed as 
brine, while in the pickling of vegetables, of which we are 
about to treat, the means chiefly used is vinegar. 

In the making of all sorts of pickles, salads, and sauces in 
which vinegar is employed, it is of much importance to have 
it of the strongest quality, as well as of the best flavour, 
of which that only which is made from white wine, and 
usually imported from France, can be called really good. 
Even v/hen brought from thence, unless purchased from a 
■\'ery respectable oilman, it will probably be adulterated : the 
fact is, that nothing but the commonest English vinegar, made 
from molasses and stale small beer, is ever to be found in 
the shops of the petty dealers. If, therefore, you like a well- 
dressed salad, never buy any other than real Provence or 
Italian oil, and the best Orleans vAnegar. They are certainly 
dearest in price, but are much the best in quality. If the 
flavour of chilis, capsicums, tarragon, shalots, garlic, or any 
root, is -wnshed to be imparted to the vinegar, it is only neces- 
sary to put a portion of either (say 1 oz.) into a bottleful of 
the liquid ; cork it closely, and in a A^ery few weeks it will be 
found thoroughl}' impregnated with tlic peculiar taste ; then 
strain it oft", and fill the bottle up again, as it will answer for 
more than once. The flavour of any herb will also be com- 
municated by boiling it for a short time in the acid ; as well 
as a few fruits, the flavour of which is very delicious when 
imparted to vinegar 



504 MODEPt:sr DOMESTIC COOKEEY. CKAr. XXYL 

PicJdes sliould be made at home, as both cheaper and bettei 
tnan if bought at oil-shops, where they are invariably made up 
with pyroligneous acid — a species of vinegar which, though 
very strong, has a disagreeable flavour. The pickles should 
be kept either in bottles, or in stone or unglazed jars, as the 
vinegar, or even soured vegetables, will corrode the glazing 
of the jars, which, being made from lead, is poisonous. 

Rules to he observed with Pickles. — Avoid as much as pos- 
sible the use of metal vessels in preparing them. Acids dis- 
solve the lead that is in the tinning of saucepans, and corrode 
copper and brass ; consequently, if kept in such for any length 
of time, they become highly poisonous. When it is necessary 
to boil vinegar, do it in a stone jar on a stove. 

Use also icoodeii spoons and forks. 

See that the pickles are always completely covered with 
vinegar ; and if any symptoms appear of their becoming 
mouldy, boil the vinegar again, adding a little more spice. It 
is a go»od rule to liave two-thirds of the jar filled with pickles 
and one-third with vinegar ; keep them also close stopped, as 
exposure to the air makes the pickles soft. 

In greening pickles, keep them closely covered, so that 
none of the steam of the vinegar in which they are boiled be 
allowed to evaporate ; and boil them only for a few minutes, 
or it will take away their strength. 

. A very small quantity of alum will make them firm and 
D-risp, but too much will spoil them. 

TO PICKLE ONIONS. 

737. — Silver Sort. — Choose small button onions, as near of 
a size as possible ; throw them into warm water, which will 
prevent their affecting the eyes so much while peeling them.'' 
As they are peeled, throw them into a strong brine of salt 
and water, with a small bit of alum ; let them remain in this 
till the next day, then put them on the fire, and boil them in 
it for a minute. Or, as they are peeled, throw them into 
milk and water ; drain them from this when they are all done, 
put them into a jar, and pour the brine on them boiling hot ; 
cover them close, and set them aside till the next day ; drain, 
and dry them in a cloth ; put them into cold distilled vinegar. 

' A simple way to prevent this is by pulling a ciust of bror.cl on the point 
of your knife and occasionally smelling at it. 



Chap. XXVI. PICKLES. oOo 

^vith a few blades of bruised ginger, som^ whole pepper, and, 
if approved, a little mace and sliced horseradish ; keep them 
always well covered with vinegar ; cork the jar close, and put 
it in a cool dry place. 

Full-groton Sort. — Peel and slice large onions, and sprinkle 
them with salt. To every gallon take about a dozen cap- 
sicums, either dry or green, slicing only a part; add a 
few cloves, some pepper and allspice, all whole. Put the 
onions into jars, distribute the spices pretty equally among 
them, fill up the jars with vinegar, and set them in a pan of 
cold water over the fire, taking care that they are closely tied 
down with a bladder : keep a wet cloth over them to prevent 
the bladder from bursting. In about H hour the onions will 
be soft enough. 

Onions and Cucumhei^s.—To every dozen of cucumbers 
put 3 large onions ; cut both in thick slices, and sprinkle salt 
over them. Next day drain them for 5 or 6 hours, then put 
them into a stone jar, pour boiling vinegar over them, and 
keep them in a warm place. Repeat the boiling vinegar, and 
stop them up again instantly, and so on till green ; the last 
time put pepper and ginger ; keep in stone jars. The vinegar 
is very good for winter salads. 

GARLIC PICKLE.—E. R. 

738. — Steep i lb. of ginger in strong salt and water for o 
days, then cut it into slices and dry it in the sun ; put it into 
a large stone jar with a gallon of tlie best white-v/ine vinegar. 
Peel 1 lb. of garlic, salt it well, and let it stand in the salt 3 
days ; wipe it, and dry it in the sun. then put it into the 
pickle ; add also I lb. of long pepper steeped in salt and water 
and well dried, 1 lb. of mustard-seed bruised, and I lb. of tur- 
meric. Shake these ingredients well in the jar, and add any- 
thing that it is desirable to pickle as it comes into season, salt- 
ing and drying them previously in the sun. When completed, 
the pickle should be kept a year or two before it is used. 

Shalots may be pickled in the same way ; or if put, as we 
have already stated, in a bottle of cold vinegar, their flavour 
will be imparted to it in the course of a month. 

CUCU3IBERS. 
739. — IffiiU-groivn, the small long sort are the best fcr pick- 
ling. Let them be fresh-gathered ; pull off the blossoms, but

506 jIODEEX domestic COOKERY. Chap. XX.VL 

do not rub them ; pour over them a strong bnne of salt and 
water boiling hot, cover them close, and let them stand ail 
night. The next day stir them gently to take off the sand, drain 
them on a sieve, and dry them on a cloth ; make a pickle with 
the best wiiite-wine vinegar, ginger, pepper (long and round), 
and a little garlic. When the pickle boils throw in the cu- 
cumbers, cover them, and make them boil as quickly as pos- 
sible for 3 or 4 minutes ; put them into a jar with the vinegar, 
and cover them closely ; when cold, put in a sprig of dill, the 
seed downward. They will be exceedingly crisp and green 
done in this manntr ; but if they do not appear to be of a fine 
colour, boil up the pickle the next day, and pour it boiling on 
the cucumbers. 

To pickle G her Jims. — Choose nice young ones, spread them 
on dishes, salt them, and let them lie a v/eek, w^ith a small bit 
of alum ; then drain them, and, putting them in a jar, pour 
boiling vinegar over them. Set them near the fire, covered 
with plenty of vine-leaves ; if they do not become a tolerably 
good green, pour the vinegar into another jar, set it over tlie 
liot hearth, and when it becomes too hot to bear your hand, 
but still not to boil, pour it over them again, covering with 
fresh leaves ; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as 
you wish. As an additional reason for preparing them at 
home, it is indeed w^ell known that the very fine green pickles 
are made so by the dealers using brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, become highly poisonous. 

If spices be not mixed among the pickle, put into the kettle, 
in a thin muslin bag, allspice, mace, and mustard-seed, to every 
quart of vinegar in the proportion of rather less than i oz. 
each of the former to 1 oz. of the seed. 

MUSHROOMS.— E. R. 
740. — To pickle Mushrooms Wliite. — Take the very small 
buttons, clean and rub them wdth a flannel, then put them into 
cold distilled vinegar, and allow it to come to a boil very 
slowly ; drain and lay them In a cloth till cold, and then put 
them into fresh distilled vinegar. If very small they ^aould 
not be allowed to boil, as so strong a heat might destroy them. 
It will therefore be sufficient to warm them ; and when dried, 
thev may be again put into the vinegar in which they had 
been originally placed, after it has been cooled. As to spice, 
a little mace will improve their flavour, but no hot pejjper

should be used. Those which are red underneath may also be 
used ; but those which are black are too old, and oidy fit for 
broiling or to make ketchup. 

To pickle 3Iushrooms JBroivn. — Choose them older, but see 
that they be fresh, and of a nearly- pink colour underneath ; 
clean, and sprinkle them with salt, put them in layers, and 
let them stand for a couple of days ; then add some whole 
pepper, cover them very close, and put them into an oven for 
an hour. Strain off the liquor, into which put cloves, mace, 
and allspice, and let the whole boil for a little while. Put 
the mushrooms into the stewpan for a short time, then take the 
whole off the fire, and when perfectly cold pot t]iem, with the 
addition of a little vinegar. 

An excellent way to preserve the flavour of muslirooiiu 
lolien being pickled is to rub them with a bit of flannel and 
salt, and from the larger take out the red inside : when they 
are black they will not do, being too old. Throw a little salt 
over, and put them into a stewpan with some mace ; as the 
liquor comes out, shake them well, and keep them over a 
gentle fire till all of it be dried into them again ; then put as 
much vinegar into the pan as will cover them, give it one 
warm, and turn all into a glass or stone jar. They will keep 
2 years, and are delicious. 

MUSHR 031 P O WDER. 

741. — TVash t peck of large mushrooms while quite fresh, 
and free them from dirt and grit with flannel ; scrape out the 
black part clean, and do not use any that are wormeaten : 
put them into a stewpan over tiie fire without water, with 2 
large onions, some cloves, J oz. of mace, and 2 spoonfuls of 
white pepper, all in powder ; simmer and shake them till all 
the liquor be dried up, but be careful the}' do not burn. Lay 
them on tins or sieves, in a slow oven, till ihey are dry enough 
to beat to powder ; then put the powder in small bottles 
corked and tied closely, and keep in a dry place. 

A teaspoonful will give a very fine flavour to any soup or 
gravy, or any sauce. It is to be added just before serving, 
and i boil given to it after it is put in. 

TO PICKLE WALNUTS. 
742. —Gather the walnuts about the middle of July, or 
before the shell is a^ all formed ; prick each with a needlo 

z2 



oCS MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVI. 

several times, and put them in salt and water ; let them stand 
2 or 3 days, changing the water every day. Make a brine of 
salt and water strong enough to bear an egg ; boil and skim 
it ; let it be quite cold before being used. To every 100 
walnuts allow 1 gallon of water. Let the walnuts soak 6 days, 
then change the brine, and let them stand 6 more : then drain 
them, and expose them to the sun that they may turn black ; 
pour over them, in a jar, a pickle of the best white-wine 
vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pimento, ginger, 
mace, cloves, mustard-seed, and horseradish, all boiled to- 
gether, but cold. To every 100 walnuts allow 6 spoonfuls of 
mustard-seed, with 1 oz. of whole black pepper, and 2 or 3 
heads of garlic or shalot, but the latter is least strong ; let 
them be quite covered with vinegar. This done, they will be 
good for several years, if closely covered. The air will soften 
them. They will not, however, be fit to eat under 6 months. 

TO PICKLE RADISH-P ODS.—E. R. 

743. — Gather the radish-pods when they are quite young, 
and put them into salt and water all night ; then boil tlie salt 
and water, and pour it over the pods in jars, and cover them 
closely to keep in the steam. When the brine is cold boil it, 
and pour it hot upon the pods again, repeating the process 
until they are green ; then put them in a sieve to drain, and 
make a pickle for them of white-wine vinegar, mace, ginger, 
long pepper, and horseradish ; pour it boiling hot upon the 
pods, and when nearly cold boil it again, and pour it over 
them. When cold, tie down the jars. 

TO PICKLE FRENCH BEAXS. 

744. — Gather them before they become string^', and, with- 
out taking off the ends, put them into a very strong brine until 
they become yellow ; drain the liquor from them, and wipe 
them dry with a cloth. Put them into a stone jar by the fire, 
put in a little bit of alum, and pour boiling vinegar upon them 
every 24 hours, preventing the escape of the steam. In 4 or 
5 days they will become green. Boil a little mace, whole 
pepper, and ginger in the vinegar. 

Do samphire the same way. 

BARBERRIES, pickled in Brine— E. R. 

745. — Gather the barberries before they are too ripe, pick 
out the leaves and dead stalks, put them into jars, with a 



Chap. XXYI. PICKLES. 50':) 

large quantity of strong salt and Avater, and tie tliem down 
\yith bladders ; when any scum arises put the barberries in 
fresh salt and water ; they will not require vinegar, their own 
acid being sufficient. 

Or, if imported from abroad, and consequently old, pick 
out all the loose barberries, and lay aside the bunches. jMake 
a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an egg. To 
2 quarts of brine put in 1 pint of white-wine vinegar and ^ lb. 
of brown sugar ; boil all together with the loose barberries, 
and let it stand till it is cold. They must not boil long. 
Strain this liquor, pour it upon the bunches of barberries, and 
tie them up closely in the jars. 

NASTURTIU3IS 

746. — So much resemble capers, both in flavour and the 
mode of pickling, as to be frequently used in the same man- 
ner ; the seeds should be allowed to get ripe after the buds 
and flowers have gone off. Gather them upon a drj" day, and 
keep them for a fe^v' days after they have been gathered ; put 
them into a jar, and pour boiling vinegar well spiced upon 
them ; when cold, cover the jar. They will not be fit for use 
for some months, but will be finely flavoured after keeping, 
and are sometimes preferred to capers, for which they are an 
excellent substitute, being useful also in serving up all dishes 
in which pickles are warmed with the gravy. Young red 
capsicums and elder-flowers before they open may be done in 
the same way. 

TO PICKLE RED CABBAGE. 

747. — Take those of a deep red or purple colour, strip off 
the outer leaves and cut out the stalk ; quarter the cabbage 
lengthwise and cut it crosswise, but not in very thin slices : 
put it into a sieve and sprinkle it w^ith salt and saltpetre ; let 
it drain for 24 hours, then squeeze it until it is very dry ; make 
a pickle with sufficient vinegar to cover the cabbages well, 
and made with equal quantities of cloves and allspice, with a 
little mace — to be put in whole, to which if a very small 
quantity of cochineal be added, it will greatly improve the 
colour ; Ijoil the vinegar and spices together for full 5 minutes, 
and strain it ; then, having put the cabbage into a stone jar, 
pour the vinegar over it boiling hot. 

This is opposed to the practice of some persons, who object 
to boiling the vinegar, and pour it cold upon the cabbage. 



510 T.rODEHX DO:-TESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XX Vi. 

TO PICKLE CAULIFLOWERS. 

748. — Cut them before they are too much blown, and upon 
a dry day ; strip off the leaves, and quarter the stalk ; scald 
them in salt and water, but do not allow them to boil ; then 
lay them to cool, covering them tliat they may not lose their 
colour ; sprinkle them with salt and water ; put them on a 
colander for 24 hours to drain. Wlien dry, cut out the thick 
stalk, or, if it be large, divide it, give it a boil, and split the 
flower into 8 or 10 pieces ; then put them carefully into jars, 
and cover them with cold vinegar which has been previously 
boiled with spices ; or the caulitiowers may have 1 boil in salt 
and vinegar, and be taken out immediately, and put into cold 
vinegar previously boiled with spices — 2 oz. each of coriander- 
seed and turmeric, 1 oz. each of mustard-seed and ginger, with 
^ oz. each of mace and nutmeg, or cinnamon, to every 3 quarts 
of vinegar ; the spices may, however, be varied. 

JBrocoli and the tops of asparagus may be pickled in the 
same manner. 

TO PICKLE TOMATAS. 

749. — For this purpose the small round ones are the best, 
and each should be pricked with a fork, to allow some of the 
juice to exude, but keep it for the pickle. Put them into a 
deep earthen vessel, sprinkle salt between everj' layer, and 
leave them there for 3 days covered ; then wash off the salt, 
and cover them with a pickle of cold vinegar, to which add 
the juice, mixed with a large handful of mustard-seed and 1 o? . 
each of cloves and white pepper, as being generally sufiicient 
for 1 peck of fruit. It makes an excellent sauce for roast 
Iiieat, and will be ready in about a fortnight. 

In America it is sometimes mixed up with layers of thinly- 
diced onions ; and chopped celery is a good addition, either 
v/ith or without onions. 

TO PICKLE LE3I0NS. 
750. — Take the finest with the thickest rind you can get, cut 
them deeply from end to end in more than one place, but not 
quite through, and fill the incisions with salt ; put each m\ 
end, and lay them in a dish near the fire, or in the sun if the 
weather be hot, to dissolve the salt, and repeat this during 
3 weeks ; then put them into a jar, with a handful of white 
mustard-seed if it be large, J to 4 lb. of bruised ginger, half 



Chap. XXVI. PICKLES. 5 1 1 

that quantity of cloves and allspice, a few chilis, and a very 
little turmeric ; boil in vinegar, and pour it upon the lemons 
when cold. It was originally prepared by the cook of the 
first Earl of Orford. 

Some people, however, add to it either shalot or garlic. It 
can hardly be ready in less than 6 months, but will keep for 
many years. 

For limes, or very small lemons, the same method must ba 
pursued, only they will not require above half the time. 

LEMON PICKLE. 

751. — Peel 6 large lemons ; cut them in quarters, lay them 
on a dish, and strew over them \ lb. of salt, turning them 
every day for a week. Then put them into a stone jar ; add 
6 large cloves of garlic, 2 oz. of horseradish shred very thin ; 
of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne each t oz. ; 2 oz. of 
mustard-seeds, bruised and tied up in a bit of thin muslin, 
and 2 quarts of the best vinegar. Cover the jar and set it in 
a pan of boiling water ; let it boil 10 minutes, then set it iu 
the oven, or anywhere that it may simmer gently, for 2 hours. 
Keep the jar closely covered, stirring it every day for 6 weeks, 
and when settled strain it and bottle for use. Another quart 
of vinegar may be added to the ingredients, and boiled up, 
which will make a very good pickle for common purposes, or 
the lemons may be added to any mixed pickles. 

MANGOES. 

752. — Although any melon may be used before it is quite 
ripe, yet there is a particular sort for this purpose, which the 
gardeners know, and should be mangoed soon after they are 
gathered. Cut a small piece out of one end, through that 
take out the seeds, and mix with them mustard-seed and shred 
garlic ; stuff the melon as full as the space will allov>^, and 
replace the cut piece. Bind it up with packthread. To allow 
for wasting, boil a good quantity of vinegar, with pepper, salt, 
ginger, and any of the sweet spices ; then pour it boiling-hot 
over the mangoes for 4 successive days ; and on the last, put 
flour of mustard and scraped horseradish into the vinegar, just 
as it boils up. Stop close. Observe that there be plenty of 
vinegar, as pickles are spoiled if not well covered. Large 
cucumbers, called " green turley," prepared in the same way, 
ixrc excellei t, and are sooner fit to be eaten 



512 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. GnAr. XXVI. 

The greater number of times boiling vinegar is poured over 
either sort, the sooner it will be ready. 

MIXED PICKLE.— E. R. 

753. — To 1 gallon of vinegar put 4 oz. of ginger bruised, 
2 oz. of white pepper, 2 of allspice, 2 of chilis, 4 of turmeric, 

1 lb. of mustard-seed, -jlb. of shalots, 1 oz. of garlic, and ^Ib. 
of bay-salt. Boil all together except the mustard-seed, wliich 
must be added afterwards. Then mix very smoothly J lb, of 
made mustard with some of the vinegar, when cold, in a basin, 
and add it to the remainder with the seed. Take brocoli, 
radish-pods, French beans, or any other vegetables or small 
fruit ; blanch the vegetables, lay them on a sieve, and sprinkle 
a little salt over them to draw out the water. Let them stand 
in the sun till very dry, then pour the vinegar boiling over 
them, slicing in some liorseradish if approved. 

Tickle of this kind can be rendered hot at pleasure, by 
additions of chilis, green and red capsicums — which, when 
gathered young, add exquisite flavour — and all sorts of foreign 
peppers. As the spring advances, a portion of every small 
root produced in a garden, if collected and thrown into cold 
vinegar, till it can be conveniently made into a regular pickle, 
will be found most excellent, at no greater expense than the 
cost of the spice and vinegar, and the trouble cf mixing it. 

INDIA PICKLE— E. R. 

754. — Is made in nearly the same manner. Put 200 gher- 
kins, 3 pints of small onions, 1 quart of nasturtiums, 1 ditto of 
radish-pods, I quartern of French beans, 6 cauliflowers, and 

2 hard white cabbages sliced, into a pan, and sprinkle them 
with salt, the onions having been previously peeled and laid 
in salt and water for a week to take. oft their strength. Then, 
after a day or two, take them out of the pan and dry them 
thoroughly in a warm place in the shade : they must be spread 
out separately. To 2 gallons of vinegar jDut 1^ oz. of allspice, 
the same of long pepper and of v/hite, and 2 of ginger, tied 
up in muslin bags. When cold, mix with the vinegar l-j lb. 
of flour of mustard, and 2 tablespoonfuls of cayenne pepper. 
Boil it well together, and pour it on the pickle : the vege- 
tables mentioned, not being all procurable at the same time, 
may be added separately, at different periods, but they muj^i 
^.il undergo the salting and drying process. 



CiiAP.XXTI. PICKLES. 513 

In choosing those vegetables some discrimination may also 
be used : when in season, fevv^ things add a liigher iiavoLir to 
the pickle than the buds and flowers of the elder. 

India Pickle may also be made thus : — Peel, slice, and salt 
1 lb. of garlic ; then put it during 3 days in the sun to dry. 
Salt and dry long pepper in the same way. Lay 1 lb. of 
white ginger in water 1 night ; then scrape, slice, and lay it 
in salt in a pan till the other ingredients sliall be read3\ 

Prepare various vegetables thus : — 

Quarter small white cabbages, salt 3 days, squeeze, and set 
tJiem in the sun to dry. Cut caulitiowers in their branches ; 
take off the green from radishes ; cut celery in 3-inch lengths ; 
ditto young French beans vv^hole, after being stringed ; like- 
wise shoots of elder, which look like bamboo. Apples and 
cucumbers, choose of the least seedy sort ; cut them in slices, 
or quarters if not too large. All must be salted, drained, and 
dried in the sun, except the latter, over which you must pour 
boiling vinegar, and in 12 hours drain them, but no salt must 
be used. 

Put the spice, garlic, J lb. of mustard-seed, and as much 
vinegar as you think enough for the quantity you are to pickle, 
into a large stone jar, and 1 oz. of turmeric to be ready against 
the vegetables shall be dried. When they are ready, put 
some of them into a 2-quart stone jar, and pour over them i 
quart of boiling vinegar. Kext day take out those vegeta- 
bles ; and, when drained, put them into a large stock-jar, and, 
]:)oiling the vinegar, pour it over some more of the vegetables • 
let them lie a night, and do as above. Thus proceed till you 
have cleansed each set from the dust which must inevitably 
fall on them by being so long in doing ; then, to every gallon 
of vinegar put 2 oz. of flour of mustard, mixing, by degrees, 
with a little of it boiling-hot. The whole of the vinegar 
should have been previous!}' scalded, but set to be cool before 
it was put to the spice. Stop the jar tight. 

This pickle will not be ready for a year ; but you may 
make a sm.all jar to be ready in a fortnight, by giving the 
cauliflower one scald in water, after salting and drying as 
above, but without the preparative vinegar ; then pour the 
vinegar, that has the spice and garlic, boiling-hot over. If at 
any time it be found that the vegetables have not swelled pro- 
perly, boiling the pickle, and pouring it over them hot, will 
j^lump them

514 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXVI. 

JHoots, such as carrots, sahijis, scorzonera, and beetroot 
may be pickled by being sliced, or cut into small pieces, and 
slightly boiled in vinegar without destroying their crispness, 
and adding the common spices ; with beetroot put button 
onions, or cut some Spanish onions in slices, lay them alter- 
nately in a jar ; boil 1 quart of vinegar with 1 oz. of mixed 
pepper, -^ oz. of ginger, and some salt, and pour it cold over 
the beetroot and onions. 

VINEGARS. 

755. — Vinegar for India Pickle. — Prepare a gallon of 
N'inegar, more or less, according to the quantity of pickles to be 
done, in the following manner : — Mix gradually i lb. of the 
best flour of mustard, and 2 oz. of powdered turmeric, with 
some of the cold vinegar at first, to ensure its being properly 
mixed ; then add the rest, with \ lb. of white mustard-seed. 
Bruise i lb. of ginger, 2 oz. of v/hite pepper, and 1 oz. of chilis, 
and tie them in a nmslin bag. Boil the whole gentl}^ for 20 
minutes or i- an hour, and pour it whilst boiling on the pickles, 
having previously drained oiF the vinegar they were first put 
into. In 10 or 12 days repeat the boiling, pour it over the 
pickles whilst boiling hot, and they will be ready for use when 
cold. 

Walnut Vinegar. — Put green walnut-shells into a brine of 
salt and water strong enough to float an egg ; let them lie 
covered in this 10 or 12 di "s ; take them out, and lay them 
in the sun for a week ; put tnem into a jar, and pour boLUng 
vinegar on them ; in about a week or 10 days pour off the 
vinegar, make it boiling hot, and pour over them again. In 
a month it will be fit for use, and will be found excellent to 
eat with cold meat, and particularly useful in making sauces. 

Cncumher Vinegar. — Pare and slice 15 large cucumbers, 
and put them in a stone jar, with 3 pints of vinegar, 4 large 
onions sliced, 2 or 3 shalots, a little garlic, 2 large spoonfuls 
of salt, 3 teaspoonfuls of pepper, and \ a teaspoonful of cay- 
enne. After standing 4 days, give the whole a boil : when 
cold, strain, and filter the liquor through paper. 

Camp Vinegar. — Slice a large head of garlic, and put it 
into a wide-mouthed bottle, with t oz. of cayenne, 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of real soy, 2 of walnut-ketchup, 4 anchovies chopped, 
1 pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal to give it the colour 



Chap. XX VI. YIXEGAKS. oi:> 

of lavender-drops. Let it stand 6 weeks ; then strain oft' quite 
clear, and keep in small bottles sealed up. 

Another. — Infuse in a quart of the best white-wine vine- 
gar i pint of walnut-ketchup, the same quantity of mushroom- 
ketchup, and also the same quantity of soy, ^ oz. of cayenne, 
4 heads of garlic, 10 shalots, 2 oz. of black and 2 oz. of white 
pepper, the same quantity of pimento and ginger, 1 oz. of 
nutmeg, 3 blades of mace, and 10 cloves, in a wide-mouthed 
2-quart bottle ; and cover very closely with cork, leather, and 
bladder. Let it remain near the fire a month, shaking it 
frequently. When any is taken out, put in as much fresh 
vinegar. This is not only a very fine sauce, but a great pre- 
servative against infectious diseases, if taken freely. 

Nasturtium Vinegar. — Pick full-blown nasturtium flowers ; 
fill a wide-mouthed bottle with them ; add \ a clove of garlic 
and a moderate-sized shalot chopped ; pour as much vinegar as 
the bottle v/ill take ; in 2 months' time rub the whole through 
a fine sieve ; add a little cayenne-pepper and salt. 

Tarragon and Elder-JJower Vi?iegar. — Take either the 
young leaves of tarragon when the plant is going into bloom, 
or the buds of elder-flowers, and to every ^ peck put 1 gallon 
of vinegar, leaving it for a fortnight in a jug to ferment. 
Then drain it^through a flannel bag, put into it a small bit of 
dissolved isinglass, and bottle it. 

The flavour of the herbs may also be extracted by boiling 
Ihe buds or leaves in vinegar, without fermentation : a mixture 
of both is very agreeable. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — To 1 quart of common vinegar put 
2 quarts of fresh raspberries, let them stand 24 hours ; then 
drain them off, but do not squeeze them. Put in 2 quarts 
more, let them stand as before, and this must be repeated a 
third time. After vrhich, put the vinegar into a jar, measure 
it, and to every pint put 1 lb. of lump-sugar. Set the jar up 
to the neck in boiling water, and let the vinegar boil for 10 
minutes, stirring it frequently. There should on no account 
be fewer raspberries than the proportion mentioned, and the 
vinegar v/ill not be fit for use r;ntil the following summer. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Boil spring water ; and when cold, 
])ut to every 3 quarts 1 quart of bruised gooseberries in a 
large t'lb. Let tliem remain (iO hours, stirring often : tlien 



51 G MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXTI, 

strain through a hair bag. and to each gallon of liquor add I 
lb. of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a toast and 
yeast ; cover the bung-hole with a bit of slate. Set the barrel 
in tlie sun, observing that the cask be well painted, and the 
iron hoops all firm. The greater the quantity of sugar and 
fruit the stronger the vinegar ; and as this is particularly use- 
ful for pickles, it irJght be well to make it of double the 
strength for that purpose. 

Chili Vinegar. — Fill a bottle with the chilis or capsicums 
■ — each of which will impart the proper warmth of flavour — • 
and cover them with vinegar ; cork it up closely, let it stand 
for 3 weeks or a month, then pour off the vinegar, and fill up 
the bottle again : chilis are the most comm.only used, but good 
capsicums will flavour several additions of vinegar. If capsi- 
cums are not procurable, put 1 oz. of ca3'-enne pepper to a 
quart of vinegivr, and let it stand some time, shaking it occa- 
sionally. Then strain it off, and fill thcibottle up again. 

LEMON FLAVOURING FOR PUDDINGS. 

756. — Peel 6 lemons very thin indeed ; put the peel into a 
glass bottle, and add a tablespoonful of bitter almonds, 
blanched, or the same quantity of peach or apricot kernels. 
Cover the whole with brandy ; shake it frequently, and in a 
month strain it, and if kept closely corked it Vvull keep for 
years. 

3IUSIIR003I KETCHUP.— E. R. 

757. — Take the full-grown flaps of freshly-gathered mush- 
rooms, crush them v/ith the hands, throw a handful of salt into 
every peck, and let them stand a night or two ; then put them 
into pans, and set them in a quick oven for 12 hours ; strain 
them through a hair sieve, and press out all the juice. To 
every gallon of liquor put of cloves, Jamaica and black pepper, 
and ginger, 1 oz. each, and ^ lb. of common salt. Set it on a 
slow fire, and let it boil until half the liquor is wasted ; then 
put it into another vessel, and, when cold, strain and bottle it ; 
at the same time corking it up closely, and covering the cork 
with oiled paper. 

Or : — Take the largest broad mushrooms, break them into 
an earthen pan, strew salt over, and stir them now and then 
for several days, till there is a thick scum over ; strain, and 
])oil the liquor with Jamaica and black peppers, mace, ginger, 
a clove or two, and some mustard-seed. Cayenne pepper is too 



CiiAP. XXVI. FAMILY SAUCES. 517 

Iiot, but a very little cliili vinegar is an improvement. Yv^hen 
cold, bottle it, and secure the corks as above, leaving the spice 
in. At thi end of 3 months strain the liquor and boil with 
fresh spice j which put into the bottles ; and in a cool place it 
will keep 2 or 3 years. 

Or : — Take a stewpan full of the large flap mushrooms 
that are not wormeaten, and the skins and fringe of those you 
have pickled : throw a handful of salt among them, and set 
them for a few days in a warm room, stirring them occasion- 
ally. They will produce a great deal of liquor, to which you 
must put 4 oz. of shalots, 2 cloves of garlic, a good deal of 
pepper, ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay-leaves, with a 
stick of horseradish ; boil slowly, and skim very well. When 
cold, put the whole in a cask without straining, but bung it 
close up. In 2 months boil it up again v/ith a little fresh 
spice : then strain it through a flannel bag, but boil Vvdiat re- 
mains in it with a small quantity of strong beer ; when strained, 
either add this to the former, or bottle it separately. It should 
be kept for some months before being used, but remains good 
for a long time, which mushroom-ketchup rarely does, if not 
boiled a second time. 

To all these receipts we strongly recommend the addition of 
a moderate quantity of port ivine — from ^ pint to not quite a 
pint to every 4 quarts — both as greatly improving the flavour 
of the ketchup and ensuring its better preservation. 

"With regard to the spice, care should be taken not to allow 
it to overpower the natural flavour of the vegetable. 

WALNUT KETCRUP.-E. R. 

758. — Take 200 walnuts at the season for pickling, beat 
them very small on a marble mortar, add about 6 handfuls of 
.salt ; put them into a clean earthen pan, and stir them 2 or 3 
times a day for 10 days or a fortnight. Then strain them 
through a cloth, pressing them very dry. Then boil up the 
liquor with mace, cloves, sliced nutmeg, and whole pepper. 
When nearly done, add 6 cloves of shalot ; bottle and cork it 
closely. The bottle should be shaken v/hen the ketchup is 
used. 

Or : — Take the green shells of ripe walnuts ; to each peck 
add 1 lb. of common or bay salt, pounded fine ; stir well toge- 
ther, and let them rema.in for 3 or 4 davs, stirrin2r them ccca- 
^lonally that the air may turn them black \ then boil a gallon 



518 ]v,fODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXYl. 

of water with 1 lb. of bay salt, and pour over the sliells boiling 
hot ; let them stand 8 or 10 days, and pour oft" the liquor. 
Boil well 1 hour, adding, towards the last, 2 oz. of long pepper, 
the same of black, 2 oz. of shalots cut small, 2 oz. of brown 
mustard-seed bruised, i oz. of mace and cloves, ^ pint of 
vinegar, and i lb. of good anchovies. Pour into a jar or cask, 
and in 2 or 3 months strain and bottle. 

Wahiut- Ketchup of the finest quality. — Boil or simmer a 
gallon of the expressed juice of walnuts when they are tender, 
and skim it well ; then put in 2 lbs. of anchovies, bones, and 
liquor, ditto of shalots, 1 oz. of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of 
pepper, and 1 clove of garlic. Let all simmer till the shalots 
sink ; then put the liquor into a pan till cold ; bottle and 
divide the spice to each. Cork closely, tie the bladder over, 
and put it in small bottles. 

It will keep 20 years in the greatest perfection, but is not. 
fit for use the first year. Be ^Try careful to express the juice 
at home, for it is generally adulterated if bought. 

Irish mode: — Take a few hundred green walnuts, scoop 
out all the whites, beat them in a mortar, and strain the juice 
through a cloth ; let it stand a day and night, strain it, and 
pour it oiF clear. To 1 pint of this liquor put \ pint of vinegar 
with i lb. of anchovies, and to each pint thus made a clove or 
two of garlic, 2 or 3 shalots, some horseradish, and 1 onion 
cut in quarters ; boil it 2 hours, and then strain it off. When 
strained add to every pint of liquor half \ oz. of mace, the 
same quantity of cloves, of nutmeg, and of whole black pepper, 
\ pint of port wine, and 2 tablespoonfuls of soy. Boil them 
together for \ an hour. Then pour it off into an earthen jar, 
and let it remain covered until it is cold ; bottle it off into 
clean dry bottles, distributing the spice equally in each ; cork 
it down closely ; take care in boiling to keep the saucepan 
covered.

Take the liquor and boil it up, with % lb. of anchovies to every 
dozen of cucumbers, 1 pint of white wine, a nutmeg, \ oz. of 
mace, and t oz. of whole pepper ; strain it, and when cold 
bottle it ; tie it down with bladder. It will keep for 2 years

The Suffolk Receipt. — Take a dozen well-grown cucum- 
bers and 4 large onions, slice them into an earthen pan with 
a good handful of salt ; let them stand till the liquor begins to 
run, break them into small pieces, and let the whole stand an- 
other day and night : then strain it off: to every quart put the 
same quantity of white, but not sweet wine, ^ lb. of anchovies, 
and a large stick of horseradish ; boil them together for ^ an 
hour, then strain it again, and to every quart put ^ oz. of white 
j)epper, ^ the quantity of mace and nutmeg, all pounded, and 
boil it well again. When cold, bottle it with the spice, and 
put a piece of ginger into each bottle. A tablespoonful in a 
sauce-boatful of cream or melted butter makes delicious white 
sauce for fowls or made dishes of veal. 

T 031 AT A KETCHUP.— E. li. 

760. — Take 2 dozen of ripe tomatas and a handful of salt ; 
slice the tomatas, and put a layer into a jar, sprinkle salt over 
it, then another layer of tomatas and salt, until the jar is full. 
Stir the contents now and then for 3 or 4 days, keeping the 
jar in a warm place by the fire ; at the expiration of which 
time press the juice from the tomatas by rubbing them with a 
wooden spoon through a sieve, and boil it with mace, pepper, 
allspice, ginger and cloves, in the proportion of about 2 oz. in 
all to 1 quart of juice, a few blades of mace, 12 cloves, a 
spoonful of pounded ginger, and the remainder pepper and all- 
spice. In 3 months boil it again with fresh spice. 

Or : — Take 6 lbs. of tomatas, sprinkle them with salt ; let 
them remain for a day or two, then boil them until the skins 
will separate easily ; pour tliem into a colander, or coarse sieve, 
and press them through, leaving the skins behind ; put into the 
liquor 1 handful of shalots, 1 pint of chili vinegar, -j pint of 
wine, pepper, cloves, ginger, and allspice ; boil them together 
until a tliird part has wasted ; then bottle it, closing the bottle 
very securely. It must be shaken before it is used. 

TOM A TA SA UCE FOR WINTER USE. 

761. — 1 peck of tomatas, 6 onions sliced, 2 heads of celery, 
a dozen shalots, 1 oz. of cayenne pepper, ^ oz. of black pepper, 
1 oz. of mace in powder. Slice them into a well-tinned sauce- 
pan, mixing the seasoning with them as they are cut up ; boil, 
keeping them well stirred ; when thoroughly soft, drain off 
the water, and rub through a hair sieve. Boil it again until

it is as thick as apple-sauce. Put it into bottles, and cork 
close. Pat the bottles into a stewpan, fill ii, with cold water, 
let it boil for 20 minutes. Keep in a cool place. Examine 
the bottles occasionally, and if there is the least indication of 
a change turn it into the kettle again, boil, and scum it, keep- 
ing it well stirred from the bottom that it may not adhere, 
and put it into the bottles again. When required for use, 
warm what is wanted with a little gravy. It is as nice as 
when fresh done, and will be found excellent with calf s head 
or brains, veal, beef, mutton, pork, or goose. An onion or a 
shalot, boiled in the gravy with which it is mixed, will be an 
improvement. 

CA3IP KETCHUP. 

762. — Take 2 quarts of old strong beer and 1 of white wine, 
add i lb. of anchovies, 3 oz. of shalots peeled, ^ oz. of mace, 
the same of nutmeg, 3 large races of ginger cut in slices ; put 
all tosrether over a moderate fire till one-third is wasted. The 
next day bottle it with the spice and the shalots. It will keep 
for many years. 

Or : — A pint of claret, the same quantity of ketchup, 4 oz. 
of anchovies, 1 oz. of fresh lemon-peel pared thin, 2 cloves of 
garlic minced fine, ^ oz. of allspice, the same of black and of 
red pepper, 1 drachm of celery-seed bruised, and i pint of 
pickle-liquor. Put these ingredients into a wide-mouthed 
bottle ; stop it close, shake it every day for a fortnight, and 
then strain it off.

races of ginger cut in slices, and boil all together over a mo- 
derate fire till one-third is wasted. Vf hen quite cold put it 
into a large jar, covered up, and leave it there for a week or 
two until the sediment is wasted, and the clear liquor is per- 
fectly transparent ; then strain it through a fine hair sieve, 
taste it, and add to it a little of any essence of spice, oil, or 
vinegar, which you think may improve it, and, if the liquid be 
not perfectly clear, give it 1 smart boil : when cool, bottle it 
in very small bottles to prevent its frequent exposure to the 
air.

It will improve by age, and may be carried on a vovace 
round the world. As may also * " 

Sauce a la 3Iilitaire, made tlins: — Put into an earthen pot 6 
shalots sliced, a clove of garlic split, 2 laurel leaves, a handful 
of thyme, basil, and tarragon-leaves, ^ oz. of mustard-seed 
bruised, 1 teaspoonful of grated Seville orange-peel, i oz. of 
cloves, the same quantity of mace, i oz. of long pepper, 
2 oz. of salt, the juice of a lemon, 6 spoonfuls of the strongest 
vmegar, and i pint of white wine. Stop the pot very closelv, 
and put it into an oven, cr upon hot ashes, for 24 hours, to allow 
the whole to infuse properly. Then allow it to settle, and strain 
It until it is quite clear : bottle it, and close the bottles tightly : 
a very small quantity will be sufficient, and it mav be used witli 
all sorts of meat, game, or fish. 

ARTIFICIAL SAUCES FOR FISH. 

764. — Those most commonly used in England are soy and 
anchovy, merely mixed from the cruets into melted butter by 
each individual of the company ; the butter, when brought to 
table m a prepared state, should be made as follows :— 
^ For Afichovij Sauce, the foundation should be some of the 
fish stock or gravy which has been alreadv made and kept in 
tlie house for future use. Take 2 or 3^ anchovies, scrape, 
but do not wash them, and b«il them along with a minced 
shalot in some of the gravy, until thev are soft enough to 
be pounded to a paste. Then strain the gravy and thicken 
It with the body of the fish, after having removed the heads 
tails, and bones. When that is done, put it, for about i of 
an hour, in the stewpan along with a glass of red wine, a 
squeeze of lemon, and the necessary quantity of butter. 

The commo7i mode is, to chop 3 anchovies, melt i lb. of 
butter in a teacupful of the water in which the fish is boiled, 
add a spoonful of vinegar and a little flour. Stir it well over 
the fire until it is quite thick. 

Or :— Kot unfrequentiy 2 or 3 spoonfuls of the prepared 
essence of anchovy are put into the melted butter, seasoned 
with a little cayenne pepper. 

^ The savoury store sauces for fish, as prepared and sold in 
Ine shops, are all to a certain degree agreeable to some palates, 
but a7ichovy and soy seem the ]3revaiiing sort for fish. The 
former, if purchased from the maker, cannot be counterfeited ; 
but soy is so often adulterated by the dealers, that the only 



522 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVI. 

sure way of getting it genuine is to procure it from the steward 
of some East India trader when she arrives in the docks. If 
well corked, it will keep good for years ; and the older, 
perhaps, the better. 

There is certainly far less trouble, and probably more eco- 
nomy, in buying any of these sauces, than in making them at 
home ; but for those ladies who choose to amuse themselves by 
having such preparations made " under their own eye," we 
add a few receipts that may be found useful. 

STORE SAUCES. 

765. — 1. Take 2 wineglasses of port, 2 of walnut, and 4 of 
mushroom ketchup, 4 anchovies pounded, with 2 shalots, a 
tablespoonful of soy, and a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper. 
Boil all well together ; when cold, put it into bottles well 
corked ; it will keep good for more than a twelvemonth. 

2. Take -^r oz. of mace, 1 oz. each of cloves, ginger, and 
allspice, 1 lb. of anchovies, a bottle of either white or red 
wine, ^ pint of vinegar, a couple of shalots, and a clove of 
garlic chopped, and a stick of scraped horseradish, together 
with a bundle of pot-herbs. Let all simmer over a slow fire 
till the anchovies are dissolved ; then strain the liquor, bottle 

t when cold, and when wanted for use add a tablespoonful of 
the sauce to \ lb. of melted butter. 

3. Thicken i lb. of butter with flour, and brown it ; then 
put to it 1 lb. of the best anchovies cut small, 6 blades of 
pounded mace. 10 cloves, 40 berries of black pepper and 
allspice, a few small onions, a faggot of sweet herbs (namely, 
savory, thyme, basil, and knotted marjoram), and a little 
parsley and sliced horseradish ; on these pour ^ pint of the 
best sherry and 1^ pint of strong gravy. Simmer all gently 
for 20 minutes ; then strain it through a sieve, and bottle it 
for use. The way of using it is, to boil some of it in the butter 
while melting. 

4. Put into a saucepan a pint of fine j)ort wine, a gill of 
mountain, -J pint of hne walnut ketchup, 12 anchovies and 
the liquor that belongs to them, a gill of walnut pickle, the 
rind and juice of a large lemon, 4 or 5 shalots, some cayenne 
to taste, 3 oz. of scraped horseradish, 3 blades of m.ace, and 
2 teaspoonfuls of made mustard : boil it all gently till the 
rawness goes off; then put it into small bottles for use. Cork 
th(MTi very close, and seal the top. 



Chap. XXA'I. FA:\riLY SAUCES. 523 

5. Chop 24 anchovies, not washed, and 10 shalots. and 
scrape 3 spoonfuls of horseradish ; which, with 10 blades 
of mace, 12 cloves, 2 sliced lemons, t pint of anchovy liquor, 
a quart of hock or Ehenish wine, and a pint of water, boil to 
a quart; then strain off; and when cold, add 3 large spoon- 
fuls of walnut ketchup. 

All or any of these will be found excellent for family use ; 
as, when added to any common sauce for fisli, or even to plain 
melted butter, a moderate quantity will impart to it a very fine 
flavour, and in many cases they may be used also for meat, if 
eaten cold. 

Pontac Ketchup is for this purpose both very simple and 
very good. Put ripe elderberries, picked from the stalk, into 
a stone jar, with as much strong vinegar as will cover them. 
Bake with the bread ; and, while hot, strain. Boil the liquor 
with a sufficient quantity of cloves, mace, peppercorns, and 
shalots, to give it a fine llavour. AYhen that is obtaijied, put 
in h lb. of the finest anchovies to ever}^ quart of liquor ; stir 
and boil only until dissolved. Yrhen cold, put it into pint 
bottles, and tie double bladders over each cork. The same 
method should be observed for preserving all ketchups. 

Ail excellent and not common PicJde, called " Salade^'* 
may be made thus : — Fill a pint stone jar with equal quantities 
of onions, cucumbers, and sour apples, all cut into very thin 
slices, shaking in, as you go on, 1 teaspoonful of salt and three 
parts of a teaspoonful of cayenne. Pour in a wineglass of 
soy, the same of white wine, and fill up the jar with vinegar. 
It will be fit for use the same day. 

Quill's Sauce is also excellent, h pint of common mush- 
room-ketchup, -J pint of walnut-liquor, 8 anchovies, 8 cloves of 
garlic. 4 bruised and 4 whole, 3 teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper 
3 of mushroom-powder, all boiled together for 5 minutes, and 
bottled when cold. 

UNIVERSAL SAUCES. 

766. — Any of the following will be found good : — 1. -^ oz. 
each of black pepj^er and pounded allspice, 1 oz. of salt, ^ oz. 
of minced shalot. 1 pint of mushroom ketchup, a tablespoonful 
of port wine, and a teaspoonful of chili vinegar. Set the bottle 
for 24 hours in a heat of about 90- of Fahrenheit ; let it stand 
for a week, then strain it oflTand bottle it. A spoonful mixed 
^dtli gravy is excellent for cutlets. 



G24 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVII, 

2. A wineglass each of mushroom and walnut ketchup, port 
wine, lemon-pickle, and chili vinegar, with i a glass cf essence 
of anchovy. Put all together into a bottle, and shake it well ; 
it will be ready for immediate use, and greatly improve any 
sauce that needs pungency. 

3. Instead of anchovy, put the same quantity of soy, either 
with or without shalot or garlic vinegar in lieu of lemon- 
pickle. 

4. Mix 2 spoonfuls of Indian soy with ^ pint of vinegar, 
half i oz. of cayenne pepper, and a small quantity of garlic. 
Let the whole stand for some time in bottle. It will be found 
an excellent relish for fish or cold meat. 



CHAPTER XXVII. 
CAKES, BUNS, AND GINGERBREAD. 

CAKES. 

767. — Observations. — In making cakes it is indispensably 
necessary that all the ingredients should be heated before they 
are mixed together ; for which purpose everything should be 
prepared for an hour or two previously to their being wanted, 
and placed near the fire or upon a stove — the flour thoroughly 
dried and warmed ; the currants, sugar, carraway-seed, and 
anything else required, heated in the same m ay ; butter and 
eggs should be beaten in basins fitted into kettles or pans of 
warm water, which will give them the requisite degree of 
temperature. Without these precautions, cakes will be heavy ; 
and the best materials, with the greatest pains, will fail to 
produce the desired results. 

The follov/ing observations should also be strictly attended 
tor- 
Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a cloth, and 
then set before the fire. Before they are to be used, a dust of 
dry flour should be thrown among them, and a shake given to 
them, which causes the cakes to be lighter. 

Eggs should be very long beaten, whites and yolks apart, 
and always strained. 

Sui^ar should be pounded in a mortar or rubbed to a pov^'der 



CiiAr. XXVII. 



CAKES. 



i)'^D 



on a clean board, and sifted through a very fine hair or la\vn 
sieve. 

Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, and, with a little 
sugar, beaten in a marble mortar to a paste ; and then mixed 
with a little wine or cream, so as to divide easily among the 
other ingredients. Tlie pans should be of earthenware ; nor 
should eggs or batter and sugar be beaten in tins, as the cold- 
ness of the metal will prevent them from becoming light. 

Use the best superfine flour ; for if the flour be of inferior 
quality the cakes will be heavy, ill-coloured, and unfit to eat ; 
but if a little potato-flour be added, it will improve their 
lightness. Cakes are frequently rendered hard, heavy, and 
uneatable, by misplaced economy in eggs and butter, or for 
want of a due seasoning in spice and sugar. 

After all the articles are put into the pan, they should be 
thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the cake de- 
pends much on their being well incorporated. 

Unless you are provided with proper utensils as well as 
materials, the diflSculty of making cakes will be so great as in 
most instances to be a failure. Accuracy in proportioning the 
ingredients is also indispensable ; and therefore scales, weights, 
and measures, down to the smallest quantity, are of the utmost 
importance. 

Iron ovens are desirable, as well for their economy of fuel 
as for the short time in ^^'hich they can be heated, and or. 
account of the celerity and convenience with which one person 
may prepare large quantities of small pastry, and bake it also. 

The most vigilant care and attention are necessary in order 
to secure success in the baking of delicate pastry or cakes ; for 



however well they may have 
been prepared, if not equally 
v^^ell baked, the result will 
be unsatisfactory ; we there- 
fore recommend a newly- 
invented moveable oven, 
made of iron, as represented 
in the cut ; it is manufac- 
tured in Paris, but will no 
doubt be soon copied in 
London. The hearth, at a, ^ 
is placed underneath ; and 
the smoke of a charcoal fire 




526 MODEEN D03,IESTIC COOKEEf. Chap. XXYII. 

escapes through a flue at the back, after heating- the oven, /), 
by means of a flue passing round it. It also may be made to 
act as a stove for many other purposes.*^ 

The heat of the oven is of great importance, especially for 
large cakes. If not lighted long enough to have a body of 
lieat, or if it is become slack, the cake will be heavy. If not 
pretty quick, the batter will not rise. Should you fear its 
catching by being too quick, put some paper over the cake to 
})revent its being burnt. To know when it is soaked, take a 
broad-bladed knife that is very bright, and plunge it into the 
very centre ; draw it instantly out, and if the least stickiness 
adheres, put the cake immediately in again, and shut up the 
oven. 

If the heat should be sufficient to raise, but not to soak it, 
let fresh fuel be quickly put in, and the cakes kept hot until 
the oven is fit to finish the soaking ; but those who are em- 
ployed ought to be particularly careful that no mistake occurs 
from negligence when large cakes are to be baked. 

Bread and cakes wetted with milk eat best when new, but 
become stale sooner than others. 

Cakes kept in drawers or wooden boxes have a disagreeable 
raste. Earthen pans and covers, or tin boxes, preserve them 
best ; but in making large cakes of any kind, which are to be 
baked in hoops, use those of wood. Cakes made with yeast 
should always be eaten fresh. 

PLUM-CAKES. 

768. — Mix thoroughly i peck of fine flour, well dried, with 
1 lb. of dry and sifted loaf-sugar, 3 lbs. of currants washed 
and very dry, ^ lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, J oz. each 
of mace, cloves, and cinnamon, a grated nutmeg, the peel of a 
lemon cut as fine as possible, and ^ lb. of almonds blanched 
and beaten with orange-flower water. Melt 2 lbs. of butter 
in 1 i pint of cream, but not hot ; put to it 1 pint of sweet wine, 
a glass of brandy, and another of rose-water, with the whites 
and yolks of 12 eggs beaten apart, and ^ pint of good yeast. 
Strain this liquor by degrees into the dry ingredients, beating 
them together a full hour ; then butter the hoop or pan, and 
bake it in a moderate oven for at least 4 hours. As you put 
in the batter, throw in plenty of citron, lemon, and orange 
candy.

Chap. XXVII. CAKES 527 

If you ice the cake, when it is nearly cold pour the icing 
over, and return it to the oven, where it should be left all 
night, or until it becomes cold ; but if the oven be warm, 
keep it near the mouth, and the door open, lest the colour by 
spoiled ; or the icing it may be left until the next morning. 

Or : — Take 2 lbs. of dried flour, the same of currants, 1 lb. 
of pounded sugar, lemon and citron peel sliced ; mix these well 
together ; beat 10 eggs, yolks and whites separately ; then melt 
li lb. of butter and 1 pint of cream; when lukewarm, put to 
it i pint of ale-yeast, nearly ^ pint of sw^et wine, and the eggs ; 
then strain the liquid to the dry ingredients, beat them well, 
and add of cloves, mace, cinnamon, and nutmeg, all together 
1 oz. ; butter the pan, and put it into a quick oven ; 3 hours 
will bake it if the oven be of baker's heat, but it will be better 
if baked somewhat longer at a more moderate temperature. 

A?i excellent Plum-cake. — Beat 1 lb. of fresh butter with 
a strong wooden fork until it resembles cream ; add 1 lb. of 
sifted sugar, and mix them very completely ; have ready the 
whites of 10 eggs beaten, and pour them into the butter and 
sugar; then add the yolks of 18 eggs, also well beaten, and 
beat them all up for 10 minutes. Take 1 lb. of Hour, 2 oz. of 
pounded and sifted spices (viz. cloves, mace, cinnamon, nut- 
meg, and allspice), and mix them by degrees wdtli the other 
ingredients ; then bea.t the whole 10 minutes longer, and when 
the oven is ready add 1 lb. of currants, 4 oz. of sliced almonds. 
^ lb. of raisins stoned and chopped, and a large glass of brandy. 
Bake the cake in a hot oven. When sufficiently baked, let 
the oven cool, and afterwards put in the cake, and allow it to 
remain for several hours to dry. 

Vej^y good common Plum-cakes. — Mix 5 oz. of butter in 3 
lbs. of dry flour and 5 oz. of fine Lisbon sugar ; add 6 oz. of 
currants washed and dried, and some pimento finely powdered. 
Put 3 spoonfuls of yeast into a pint of new milk warmed, and 
mix into a light dough with the above. Make it into 12 cakes, 
and bake on a floured tin \ an hour. 

Plum-cakes require less butter and eggs for having yeast, 
and eat equally light and rich. If the leaven be only of flour, 
milrv and water, and yeast, it becomes more tough, .and is less 
easily divided, than if the butter be first put with those ingre- 
dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the fire. 

Little Plum-cakes to keep long. — Dr^f 1 lb. of flour, and 



52S MODEKX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXTiK 

mix with 6 oz. of finely-pounded sugar ; beat 6 oz. of butter 
to a cream, and add to 3 eggs, well beaten, ^ lb. of currants 
washed and nicely dried, and the flour and sugar ; beat all for 
some time, then dredge flour on tin plates, and drop the batter 
on them the size of a M'alnut. If properly mixed, it will be a 
stiif paste. Bake in a brisk oven. 

BRIDE-CAKE. 

769. — AYash 2^ lbs. of fresh butter in plain water first, and 
then in rose-water ; beat the butter to a cream; beat 20 eggs, 
yolks and whites separately, ^ an hour each. Have ready 
2h lbs. of the finest flour, well dried and kept hot, likewise 
It lb. of sugar pounded and sifted, 1 oz. of spice in fine 
powder, 3 lbs. of currants nicely cleaned and dry, ^ lb. of 
almonds blanched, and | lb. of sweetmeats cut, not too thin. 
Let all be kept by the fire, mix all the dry ingredients, pour 
the eggs stranied to the butter, but beat the whites of tlie 
eggs to a strong frotli ; mix ^ pint of sweet wine with the 
same quantity of brandy, pour it to the butter and eggs, mix 
well, then have all the dry things put in by degrees ; beat 
them very thoroughly — you can hardly do it too much. 
Having ^ lb. of stoned jar-raisins chopped as fine as possibL^, 
mix them carefully, so that there should be no lump, and add 
a teacupful of orange-flower water ; beat the ingredients to- 
gether a full liour at least. Have a hoop well buttered ; take 
a white paper, doubled and buttered, and put in the pan round 
the edge ; do not fill it more than three parts with batter, as 
space should be allowed for rising. Bake in a quick oven. 
It will require full 3 hours. In making cakes of a larger size, 
put at the rate of 8 eggs to every pound of flour, and other 
ingredients in the same proportion. 

The cake must be covered with an icing,

together, and beat full i an hour with a silver spoon. Butter 
small pattypans, half fill, and bake 20 minutes in a quick oven. 
The same materials made into a paste, then rolled out into 
small round cakes, and baked, make very nice tea-cakes.

will bake it in an hour. 

Or : — Beat up separately the yolks and whites of 4 eggs 
for i of an hour ; then sift into both i ib. of grated sugar ; 
beat it well up with the eggs, and stir the whole gradually

Another. — Mix H lb. of flour, and 1 lb. of common lump- 
sugar, 8 eggs beaten separately, 1 oz. of seeds, 2 spoonfuls of 
yeast, and the same of milk and water. 

A light Seed-cahe. — Take the yolks of 6 eggs and the whites 
of 3, beat them well for ^ an hour ; then put in 6 oz. of pow- 
dered loaf-sugar, mix it well with the eggs, add gradually 7 
oz. of flour and a few carraway-seeds ; stir the whole well 
together, and put it into a pan or dish for baking. If the 
oven is hot, ^ an hour will bake it. The moment it is taken 
out of the oven turn it out of the mould, and let it lie upside 
down until quite cold. Great care should be taken in the 
baking. 

Plain Cake. — 4 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of currants, and ^ lb. 
of butter, with clove, carraway, and coriander seeds to the 
taste, together with lemon-peel grated ; wet it with milk and 
■5- pint of yeast. 

Or : — Beat 1 lb. of butter to a cream with the hand, and 
add 1 lb. of brown sugar, which beat in for 10 minutes longer ; 
then add 8 eggs, 2 at a time, beating them as they are put in 
until the whole is very smooth ; then stir in 1 i lb. of flour, a 
little at a time, till it is well mixed, season with a little nut- 
meg, and add 1 lb. of currants the last thing, together with 
citron and orange peel cut into pieces. Put the ingredients 
into a shape, and bake it for 2 hours. 

An excellejit Cake. — Rub 2 lbs. of dry fine flour with 1 lb. 
of butter washed in plain, and afterwards in rose-water ; mix 
it with 3 spoonfuls of yeast in a little warm milk and water. 
Set it to rise H hour before the fire ; then beat into it 2 lbs.

whites of 6 for glazing ; take H lb. of fine sugar, beat the 
sugar and eggs until they are thick and white ; take 1 4 lb. of 
sweet butter, and beat it well to cream ; take ir oz. of cinna- 
mon, the same of nutmeg and cloves, t oz. of carraway-seed, 
H lb. of citron, 1 lb. of orange-peel, 1 lb. of ahnondS

Chap. XXYIT. CAKES. 53i 

eggs, add the beaten butter and a gill of brandy ; mix all well 
together ; put it into the frame, and bake it. 

FA3IILY BREAD-CAKE. 

'J't^. — Take the quantity of a quartern loaf from the dough 
when making white bread, and knead well mto it 2 oz. of 
butter, 2 oz. of Lisbon sugar, and 8 oz. of currants. Warm 
the butter in a teacupful of good milk. 

By the addition of i oz. of butter or sugar, or an e^^ or 
two, you may make t^he cake richer. A teacupful of raw 
cream improves it much. Bake it in a pan ; it will remain 
good for several days ; and if carraways be substituted for 
currants, it may be eaten at tea with butter. 

SAVOY CAKE, 

774. — Break 10 very fresh eggs into a pan (a round-bot- 
tomed biscuit pan is best for the purpose) with 1 lb. of sifted 
loaf-sugar ; set the pan in warm water and whisk very briskly 
for i of an hour, or until the batter is quite thick and warm ; 
take it out of the water and M'hisk until cold ; stir in as 
lightly as possible to thoroughly mix it, 1 lb. of flour ; flavour 
with essence of lemon, or the rind of a lemon rubbed on 
sugar ; pour into the mould and bake. 

Prepare the mould as follows : — Melt a little fresh butter, 
take off the scum, and pour it off the dregs ; let it cool, and 
with a brush (a painter's small brush is very good for the 
purpose) rub it well, so that it looks creamy, into all the points 
of the mould, and dust it with sugar and flour, mixed in equal 
quantities, sufficient to adhere to the batter. 

The same preparation is used for Sponge Cakes, baking 
them of course in proper moulds. 

Or : — Take 8 eggs, ^ the whites, f lb. of lump-sugar, ^ lb. of 
flour, i pint of water, the peel of a lemon ; mix as follows : — ■ 
Over night pare a good-sized lemon thin, and put the peel 
into the water ; when about to make the cake, put the sugar 
into a saucepan, pour the water and lemon-peel to it, and let 
it stand by the fire to get hot. Break the eggs into a deep 
earthen vessel that, has been made quite hot ; whisk the eggs 
for a few minutes with a whisk that has been well soaked in 
water ; make the sugar and water boil up, and pour it boiling 
hot over the eggs ; continue to whisk them briskly for about 
X of an hour, or till they become quite thick and white, v/hich 

2a2

MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVll. 



is a proof of their lightness. Have the flour well dried, and 
quite warm from the fire ; just stir it lightly in, put the cake 
into moulds, and bake them immediately in a moderately hot 
oven. 





Cake Moulds. 



VIENNA CAKE.—E.R. 

775. — 1 lb. of flour, the same quantity of butter and of 
tdfted loaf-sugar, and the yolks of 14 eggs, the whole to be 
beaten together for f of an hour ; then beat the whites of the 
eggs to a froth ; mix the greater part by degrees to the paste, 
and keep beating till the whole is soft and light. Cut pieces 
of paper the size and shape of the dish to be used, spread the 
paste upon them, put it into the oven, and let it bake, but not 
enough to be brown ; then spread each with jam made of fruit, 
and a little jelly, and pile one upon the other. Let it remain 
until quite cold, and, some liours afterwards, add a fresh 
quantity of sugar to the whites of eggs ; pour it over the 
top, and ornament it with preserved orange and lemon chips, 
coloured sugar-plums, &c., and let it stand in a cool oven to 
dry. 

Or : — Take 4 layers of fine sponge-cake, not quite 1 inch 
thick ; or the sponge-mixing may be baked at once in a round 
shape, about 6 or 8 inches in diameter, and afterwards divided 
into slices. Put between each layer of cake one of preserves, 
each of a different sort, with strawberries at the top ; and 

icing of 
in bridecake, tinted red, and fla- 
voured with essence of lemon, rose, or vanilla. The icing 
must be dried, but the cake must not be again put into the 
oven. 

RICE-CAKE. 

776. — Take 9 oz. of flour, dry it well ; 9 oz. of ground rice, 
20 oz. of sugar pounded very fine and sifted, and 12 eggs. 



cover the whole cake, top and sides, with a thick 



=;ugar, similar to that used 



CuAP. XXVII. CAKES. 533 

Beat the eggs and sugar well together ; then add the flour and 
the rice, a spoonful at a time until ail is used — beating at the 
same time tor f of an hour. Before the cake goes into the 
oven, add the peel of a whole lemon grated, then put in i the 
juice, and send it to the oven ; 40 minutes will bake it. 

Or : — 1 lb. of ground rice, 1 lb. of lump-sugar sifted, 8 
eggs, yolks and whites, vvell beaten all together, the rind of a 
lemon grated, and the juice of one. YV^hen all the ingredients 
are mixed, beat them ^ an hour longer, then put it into a 
well-buttered tin ; H hour will bake it. 

Or : — Mix 1 oz. of ground rice, 3 oz. of flour, 8 oz. of 
pounded sugar ; then sift by degrees into 8 yolks and 6 whites 
of eggs, and tlie peel of a lemon shred so fine that it is quite 
mashed ; mix the whole well in a tin stewpan over a very slow 
fire with a wliisk, then put it immediately into the oven in the 
same, and bake 40 minutes. 

Or : — Take -g- lb. of clarified butter, 8 eggs well beaten, 
leaving out the whites of 2, f lb. of pounded sugar, and the 
grated peel of a lemon ; mix these well together ; then add 
ground rice and dried flour, -^ lb. of each ; currants and can- 
died peel may be added when approved. 

WAFERS.~E. R. 

717 . — Take fine flour, dried and sifted, make it into a smooth 
thin batter with very good milk, or a little cream and water ; 
add about as much white wine as will make it thick enougli 
for pancakes, sweeten it with a little loaf-sugar, and flavour 
with beaten cinnamon. When thus prepared, have the wafer- 
irons made ready by being heated over a charcoal fire ; rub 
the irons with a piece of linen cloth dipped in butter, then 
pour a spoonful of the batter upon them, and close them almost 
immediately ; turn them upon the fire, pare the edges with a 
knife, as some of the batter will ooze out. A short time will 
bake them when the irons are properly heated. The wafers 
must be curled round whilst warm. 

Sugar-wafers, which are much in use throughout France 
and Spain for eau-sucree, are made by whisking white sugar 
into a froth with the white of eggs and isinglass, and then 
baking it as above. 

PROVINCIAL CAKES. 

778. — Shrewslmry. — Sift 1 lb. of sugar, some pounded cin- 
namon, and a nutmeg grated, into 3 lbs. of flour, the finest 



534 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEKY. Chap. XXVII. 

sort ; add a little rose-water to 3 eggs well beaten, and mix 
tliese with the flour, &-c. ; then pour into it as much butter 
melted as will make it a good thickness to roll out. Mould it 
well, roll thin, and cut it into such shapes as you like. 

Marlborough, — Beat 8 eggs and 1 lb. of pounded sugar -f of 
an hour ; then by degrees mix in 12 oz. of fine flour well 
dried ; add 2 oz. of carraway-seeds, and bake in soup-plates or 
tin pans in a brisk oven. 

Tunhridge. — Mix i lb. of flour with 2 oz. of butter and \ 
lb. of sugar, to which add 1 or 2 oz. of carraway-seeds, and 
make it into a stiff" paste with a little water ; cut it into round 
cakes, prick them with a fork, and bake them upon floured 
tins. 

Banhury — Are made without seedsj and chiefly composed 
of mincemeat baked for about -^ an hour in a rich paste, then 
cut into square or oblong pieces, and generally eaten cold. 

Yorkshire. — To 1 quart of lukewarm milk add J pint of 
good ale yeast, and mix them well together with enough flour 
to make a thick batter ; let it stand in a warm place till it rises 
as high as it can ; then rub ^ lb. of butter into some flour, 
and mix Avith it 4 eggs ; beat all well together, add sufficient 
flour to make it into dough, and let it stand for ^ an hour ; 
then work it lightly up and make into buns, put them on tins 
in a slow oven, cover them with a light cloth, and toast them 
with butter. 

BUTTER CAKES.- E. R. 

779.- -To ^ lb. of butter add the same quantity of brov/n 
sugar, 3 eggs, the rind of 2 lemons, 1 oz. of pounded cinna- 
mon, and h the quantity of powdered ginger ; work into it as 
much flour as will make it a paste ; cut it into shapes or leave 
it whole, and strew over the top some pounded almonds and 
candied orange-peel. Bake in a slow oven. 

3IACAR00NS. 

780. — Blanch 4 oz. of almonds, and pound with 4 spoonfuls 
of orange-flower ^^•ater ; wiiisk the whites of 4 eggs to a froth, 
then mix it, and 1 lb. of sugar sifted, with the almonds to a 
paste ; and, laying a sheet of wafer-paper on a tin, put it on 
in different little cakes, the shape of macaroons. 

Or : — Beat the whites of 4 eggs into a strong froth, add to 
it the juice of 2 limes or lemons, and i lb, of j)ounded sugar ; 



Chap. XXVII. CAKES. 535 

mix them up well together, then add 2 more whites of eggs 
beaten, another i lb. of sugar, 1 lb. of almonds sliced, and i 
lb. of flour, which last must be just sprinkled over the other 
ingredients after they have been well mixed together, which 
will take nearly an hour. Take up a sufficient quantity of the 
mixture in a spoon, drop it on paper sprinkled with flour, and 
bake on tins in a slow oven for 2 hours. 

Or : — To 1 lb. of blanched siveet almonds add 2 oz. of biiier 
almonds, with the juice of 1 lemon and a glass of ratafia. 

ALMOND CAKES.— U. R. 

781. — Beat 1 lb. of almonds very fine with rose-water, mix 
in 1- lb. of sifted sugar, make them into shapes, put them be- 
fore the fire to dry on one side, then turn them. When dry 
on both sides, take some sifted sugar and as much white of 
e^^ as will just wet it ; beat it with a spoon ; as it grows white 
put in a little more e^^, till it is thin enough to ice the cakes ; 
then ice one side, dry it before the fire, and be sure it is quite 
dry before icing the other side. The flavour of the almond is 
often given to pastry by bay-leaves and the essence of fruit- 
kernels, but pounded bitter almonds are safer and better for 
the purpose. 

Ratajia Cakes are made in the same manner, but substitute 
ratafia-brandy for rose-water, and use 1 lb. of bitter instead of 
the same quantity of sweet almonds ; make them rather smaller. 

JU3IBLES. 

782. — To li lb. of butter, well creamed, put 1 lb. of sugar 
and 3 eggs beaten well together, 1^ lb. of sifted flour, and 2 
spoonfuls of rose-water ; mix these well together, and with a 
fork drop them on a tin, and bake in a quick oven. 

Or : — Take ^ lb. of flour, the same weight of loaf-sugar 
grated, 2 oz. of butter rubbed into the flour, 1 egg, and a 
dessertspoonful of ratafia-brandy or orange-flower water ; make 
it up into a paste ; if more moisture is required, add a spoon- 
ful of cream ; drop it on tins with a fork. 

JRout Drops. — Mix 2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of butter, 1 lb. of 
sugar, 1 lb. of currants clean and dry ; then wet into a stif? 
paste, with 2 eggs, a large spoonful of orange-flower water, 
the same each of rose-water, sweet wine, and brandy ; drop on 
a tin plate floured. A very short time bakes them. 



o36 MODEKN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXVTL 

PASSOVER CAKES. 
783. — Make a stiff paste with biscuit-powder, milk, and 
water ; add a little butter, the yolk of an egg-, and a little 
white sugar. Cut into pieces, mould with the hand, and bake 
in a brisk oven : they should not be too thin. 

Without butter. — Warm i pint of water, flavoured with a 
little salt ; mix 4 beaten eggs with i lb. of Hebrew or " matso- 
fiour," and a couple of lumps of white sugar with a teacupful 
of milk ; mix all together, and bake in a tin. 

SCOTCH RECEIPT FOR SHORT BREAD.— E. R. 

784. — To 4 lbs. of flour take 2 of butter, quite fresh and 
without salt, ^ lb. of moist sugar, i lb. of citron, and the same of 
almonds, the latter blanched, and all cut small. Mix the sugar 
and fruit well with the flour, then work it up with the butter, 
cold, till it is smooth and compact, but it will take a long time ; 
divide into 4 or more pieces, and roll out each piece into an 
oblong cake, having previously floured the table well. Prick 
the top with a steel fork, strew some orange and citron cut thin, 
and some large carraway-comfits, press them in with the roller, 
then pinch round the edges, put the cakes in floured tins ; bake 
for 20 minutes. If the cake rise after the pressing of the finger, 
it is sufliciently done. 

O?- : — One lb. each of butter and sifted sugar, 2 lbs. of flour, 
8 oz. of sweet and 4 oz. of bitter almonds, a small piece of cin- 
namon, all pounded, and a glass of brandy. Soften the butter 
before the fire, then rub in tiie flour, and make it into a paste ; 
roll it out ^ inch thick, and bake it on a tin in a slow oven, 
as it should be of a pale colour. 

A GOOD POUNDCAKE. 

785. — Beat 1 lb. of butter to a cream, and mix with it the 
whites and yolks of 8 eggs beaten apart. Have ready, warm 
by the fire, 1 lb. of flour, and the same of sifted sugar ; mix 
them and a few cloves, a little nutmeg and cinnamon, in fine 
powder together ; then by degrees work the dry ingredients 
into the butter and eggs. Yf hen well beaten, add a glass of 
wine and some carraways. It must be beaten a full hour. 
Butter a pan, and bake it an hour in a quick oven. 

The above proportions, leaving out 4 oz. of the butter, and 
the same of sugar, make a less luscious cake, and to m(?it tastes 
a more pleasant one. 



Chap. XXVII. CAKES. 53V 

LEMON CAKE. 
786. — Beat 6 eggs, the yolks and whites separately, till in a 
solid froth ; add to the yolks the grated rind of a fine lemon 
and 6 oz. of sugar dried and sifted ; beat this i of an hour ; 
shake in with the left hand 6 oz. of dried flour ; then add the 
whites of the eggs and the juice of the lemon ; when these are 
well beaten in, put it immediately into tins, and bake it about 
an hour in a moderately hot oven. 

SODA-CAKE.— E. R. 

787. — 1 lb. of flour, 1 drachm of soda, ^ lb. of sugar, ^ lb> 
,->f currants, and i lb. of butter. Mix the soda with the flour, 
then rub in the butter, after which add the sugar and the 
currants, and then a pint of milk. Put it into the oven imme- 
diately. 

A variety may be given by substituting J lb. of lemon, 
orange, and citron, car^died, and 1 oz. of pounded sweet almonds, • 
for the currants ; but in that case the cake will require rather 
more soda. 

Or: — A good jjlain one can be made with 2 lbs. of flour, 8 
oz. of butter or dripping, 8 oz. of sugar, 1 pint of milk, with 
3 or 4 eggs, and a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda. Carbonate 
of soda should be very sparingly used in light cakes, and then 
it ought to be combined with a little sour milk, or acid, to 
produce carbonic gas, in order to make them porous. Mix the 
carbonate of soda intimately with the fl.our or sugar, then mix 
them with the other ingredients, and make the whole into a 
dough with the milk, or milk and eggs well beaten ; put it into 
a well-buttered tin or hoop, and bake it in a cool oven about 
3 hours. If currants are added, it will take fully that time. 
A good plan to ensure the sides and bottom from being burnt 
is to tie a piece of paper folded in 3 or 4 folds round the sides, 
and put the tin or hoop on a flat baking tin, with a little saw- 
dust or fine ashes between. 

FRENCH CAKES. 

788. — BoJas cVAmor. — li lb. of flour, 1 small teacupful of 
veast, h pint of milk warmed, 1 lb. of butter, and 4 eggs. 
Make a hole in the flour, and pour into it the milk, eggs, and 
yeast ; mix them all well together ; beat the dough, adding 
the butter by degrees. Let it stand for 1 hour to rise ; then 
take ^ lb. of sifted sugar, and mix it well in with the dough ; 

2 A3 



538 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXYII. 

butter the cups or pans, put in the dough, and ornament the 
top with candied orange or lemon peel. 

Les Brioches are, in France, more used as a breakfast- 
bread than as cakes, but in England they are only to be had, 
when ordered, in the shops of some foreign pastry-cooks : 
which is to be regretted, as they are considered a great deli- 
cacy when made in the form of twists or other fancy shapes, 
and eaten either hot or cold. 

Take any quantity of the brioche paste (as at Xo. 540) ; 
knead it over-night, and cover it in a warm place, to allow it 
to rise ; then, at a convenient hour for breakfast, knead it 
again, and if not sufficiently risen, add an e<yg and a little 
more yeast, make it into shapes, and bake them for f to 1 
hour, according to their size. 

Frangipane is a French paste, made with 2 or 3 eggs put 
mto a saucepan with 1 tablespoonful of flour, moistened with 
*a little milk, and placed on the fire for about 10 minutes ; 
taking care to stir the materials continually, to prevent them 
from sticking to the pan. The substance may either be used 
as a paste for tartlets, or eaten as cakes, if made with sugar 
and macaroons. 

La G alette is in great favour .among the Parisians, who 
usually eat it with sweetmeats, but vary it in point of richness 
by the greater or less quantity of cream and butter employed 
in making it up. It is thus made : — 

Take 1 lb. each of butter and flour, a little salt, and 2 eggs ; 
knead the whole together into a paste, roll it to not more than 
an inch in thickness, and make it the size of a dessert-plate. 
Then put it into the oven for \ of an hour ; take it out ; beat 
up 2 eggs with a little cream and some salt, pour it over the 
cake, and return it to the oven to bake for another \ of an 
hour ; or, if you please, ornament the back with candied citron. 

SPANISH CAKES, 

789. — Put 12 eggs (cleared of the '-'trails") into a large 
chocolate-pot, and mill them to a froth. Mix by degrees ^ lb. 
of double-refined sugar, 1 lb. of flour dried, and h lb. of almonds 
beaten to a paste \rith orange-flower water : to which add 4 
spoonfuls of rose-water, a glass of mountain wine, and h oz. of 
pounded cinnamon. "When all the ingredients are in the pot, 
mill them t of an hour. Butter a pan, and bake in a slow oven. 



Chap. XXVII. CAKES. 539

the butter has been worked with the hand to a cream, sift in 
the sugar, which should be quite hot ; when mixed pour in the 
yolks of eggs, then add the whites; work it ^ an hour, then 
add the flour by degrees ; when thoroughly mixed, add a very 
small teacupful of brandy. The currants and almonds, with 
i lb. of lemon or citron peel, should be added just before the 
cakes are placed in the c^'en, which should be hot. The cake 
should be beaten an hour ; the hand should be kept moving 
the same wav, and not taken out. 

ISLE OF WIGHT CRACKNELS. 
791. — Mix Math a quart of flour ^ a nutmeg grated, the 
yolks of 4 eggs beaten, with 4 spoonfuls of rose-water, into a 
stiff paste, with cold water ; then roll in 1 lb. of butter, and 
make them into a cracknel shape ; put them into a kettle of 
boiling water, and boil them till they swim ; then take them 
out and put them into cold Avater ; when hardened, lay them 
out to diy^, and bake them on tin plates. 

KRINGLES. 

792. — Beat well the yollcs of 8 and whites of 2 eggs, and 
mix with 4 oz. of butter just warmed, and with this knead 
1 lb. of' flour and 4 oz. of sugar to a paste. Eoll into thick 
biscuits ; prick them, and bake on tin plates. 

R USKS. 

793. — Beat 7 eggs well, and mix with i pint of new milk, 
in which have been melted 4 oz. of butter ; add to it J pint of 
yeast and 3 oz. of sugar, and put them, by degrees, into as 
much flour as will make a veri/ light paste, rather like a 
batter, and let it rise before the fire -k an hour ; then add some 
more flour to make it a little stifl'er, but not stiff. Work it 



540 MODEPtX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXYIl. 

well, and divide it into small loaves or cakes, about 5 or 6 
inches wide, and flatten them. "When baked, and cold, slice 
them the thickness of ru^ks, and put them in the oven to brown 
a little. The cakes, when first baked, eat delicious! y, if 
buttered for tea ; or, made with carraways, to eat cold. 

BENTON TEA-CAKES. 
794. — Mix a paste of flour, a little bit of butter, and milk ; 
roll as thin as possible, and bake on a back-stone over the fire, 
or on a hot hearth. 

Ayiother sort as Biscuits. — Rub into 1 lb. of flour 6 oz. of 
butter and 3 large spoonfuls of yeast, and make it into a paste 
vv'ith a suflficient quantity of new milk ; make into biscuits, 
and prick them with a clean fork. 

Or : — Melt 6 or 7 oz. of butter, with a sufficiency of new 
milk warmed to make 7 lbs. of flour into a stiff" paste ; roll thin 
and make into biscuits. 

C0FFEE-CA2i.ES. 

795. — Take 1 lb. of flour, i lb. of butter, the same of 
pounded sugar, 1 eg-g, and 1 oz. of carra way-seeds ; mix the 
whole ^ith warm milk and a tablespoonful of rose-water ; roll 
it out thin, and cut it into cakes with the top of a wineglass, 
and bake on tins. 



BISCUITS. 

796. — Those of the common sort are made in various ways. 
For a large quantity, beat up 8 eggs during nearly ^ an hour ; 
then put in 1 lb. of white powdered sugar, with the grated peel 
of a lemon, and wliisk that again for the same time, or until it 
appears well mixed ; after which make it into a batter witii 
1 lb. of flour and a little rose-water. 

Bake the dough in tins, or on papers, and either sugar them 
or put in carraway-seeds. 

Or ; — 1 lb. of flour, ^ lb. of loaf-sugar, and I lb. of butter ; 
rub all together ; wet it with 1 egg beaten up in ^ a teacupful 
of milk, and roil it out thin. 

Or : — Put the same quantities of flour, sugar, and butter; 
but, instead of milk, moisten them with brandy. You may cut 
the dough into shapes Mith the edge of a wineglass, and prick 
them over before going to the oven. 



Chap. XXVII. BISCUITS. 54i 

Ginger Biscuit. — Work well 11 lb. of butter, with the same 
weight of moist sugar ; add 8 eggs well beaten ; stir in 2^ lbs. 
of Hour, 1 oz. of volatile salts, and i oz. of ground ginger ; 
mix these well, roll out the paste, cut it in fancy shapes, and 
bake crisp. 

Or : — Beat 1 lb. of butter to a froth, H lb. of moist sugar, 
2 oz. of ground ginger, and a grated nutmeg ; mix it up with 
as much tiour as will make it into a stiff paste ; roll it out thin, 
and cut it into small cakes ; bake in a quick oven. 

Tea Biscuits are made with the finest flour, fresh butter 
seasoned with a little salt, and melted in warm milk : for a 
moderate quantity, 1 lb. of flour, 2 oz. of butter, and 1 pint of 
milk will be sufficient. Make it into a stiii paste, adding to 
it a large tablespoonful of strong brewers' yeast, and leave it 
covered near the fire during time enough to make it rise. 
When quite light, knead it mcU, roll it out an inch thick, and 
form it into round cakes of the size of a muffin. Bake them 
in buttered pans until they are of a light brown ; split and 
butter them, and send them to table hot. 

If intended to be kept and eaten cold, the paste must be 
rolled out very thin, and cut of a smaller size. 

Swiss Biscuits. — Mix 4 oz. of fine flour, 2 oz. of sifted 
sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, and t lb. of butter, to a 
paste, with the white of an eg^-, and a sufficient quantity of 
milk. Roll it thin, cut into biscuits, and brush them over 
with the yolk of an eg^r, over which sift fine sugar : bake them 
on tins. 

Biscuits to heep a long time. — Mix 2 lbs. of flour, 1 lb. of 
sugar, and I oz. of carraways, with 4 or 5 eggs and a few 
spoonfuls of water, to make a stiff paste : roll it thin, and cut 
it into any shape. Bake on tins lightly floured. While baking, 
boil 1 lb. of sugar, in a pint of water, to a thin syrup : while 
both are hot, dip each cake into it, and put them on tins into 
the oven to dry for a short time ; when the oven is cooler still, 
return them there again, and let them stay 4 or 5 hours. If 
kept dry they will be good for months. 

White Cakes. — Dry h lb. of flour, rub into it a very little 
pounded sugar, 1 oz. of butter, 1 egg, a few carraways, and as 
much milk and water as to make a paste ; roll" it thin, and cut 
it with the top of a canister or wineglass. Bake 15 minutes ou 
tin plates. 



542 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVII. 

Wine biscuits. — Rub into 1 lb. of dry flour 4 oz. of butter, 
4 oz. of white powdered sugar, 1 egg, and a spoonful or two 
of thin cream to make it into a paste. When mixed, put cur- 
rants into one half, and carraways into the rest. Cut them as 
before, and bake on tins. 

Another. — Eub I lb. of fresh butter in 1^ lb. of sifted flour, 
and make it into a dough with a little cold water. Koll it out 
into a sheet ^ inch thick, and cut it into round cakes with the 
edge of a tumbler. Prick them M^ith a fork ; lay them in a 
shallow iron pan sprinkled with flour, and bake them in a 
moderate oven till they are brown. Send them to table warm. 

The introduction into England of the American soda-biscuits 
or crackers having caused several inquiries to be made for other 
American biscuits or cakes, we subjoin the following approved 
receipts : — 

Cookies. — One lb. of butter, ^ lb. of sugar, 2 teaspoonfuls 
(or 3 drachms) of saleratus, 3 lbs. of flour, and about a pint of 
buttermilk, or milk that is slightly sour, may be used instead ; 
flavour the whole with ground coriander-seed according to 
taste. Cinnamon, ginger, or nutmeg, may be substituted for 
the coriander, if desired. Warm the buttermilk, and dissolve 
the saleratus in it by stirring. The sugar may be boiled in 
i pint of water, and allowed to cool before, using, when less 
buttermilk must be used, and the butter must be rubbed small 
with the flour ; or beat the butter and sugar together in a pan 
to a nice cream ; add the other ingredients, and make into a 
paste. Make into rolls ^ inch thick, and cut into what shape 
you please ; or roll out the paste to the same thickness, and 
cut it into any desired form. Bake from 20 minutes to i an 
hour in a moderately cool oven. The same preparation, 
with only half the quantity of butter and sugar, and ^ pint 
more milk or water, makes a most excellent cake (superior to 
soda) for tea, or for children, to which carraway-seeds or cur- 
rants may be added. 

Waffles are likewise in very general use among the Ameri- 
cans, and are made thus ^ — 

Put 2 pints of rich milk into separate pans ; cut up and 
melt in one of them i lb. of butter, warming it slightly ; then, 
when it is melted, set it away to cool ; beat 8 eggs very light, 
and mix them gradually into the oth(n" pan of milk alternately 
with ^ lb. of flour ; then mix in by degrees the milk that has 



Chap. XXYIL BUXS. 543 

the butter in. Lastly, stir in a large tablespoonful of strong 
fresh yeast, cover the pan, and set it near the fire to rise. 
When the batter is quite light, heat your waffle-iron, by 
putting it among the coals of a clear bright fire ; grease the 
inside with butter tied in a rag, and then put in some batter. 
Shut the iron closely, and, when the waffle is done on one side, 
turn the iron on the other. Take the cake out by slipping a 
knife underneath, and then heat and grease the iron for an- 
other waffle. Send them to table quite hot, 4 or 6 on a plate, 
having buttered them and strewed over each a mixture of 
powdered cinnamon and white sugar. Or you may send the 
sugar and cinnamon in a little glass bowl."" 

ICING FOR CAKES. 
797. — Beat the whites of 4 eggs to a solid froth, add gra- 
dually f lb. of refined sugar pounded and sifted ; mix in the 
juice of -^ a lemon ; beat it till very light and wliite. The 
cake should be cold. Place it before the fire, pour over it the 
icing, and smooth over the top and sides with a knife. It 
might be set to dry at the mouth of a cool oven. 



BUNS. 

798. — To make a good plain Bu7i. — Rub 4 oz. of butter 
into 2 lbs. of flour, 4 oz. of sugar, a nutmeg, or not, as you 
like, a few Jamaica peppers, a dessertspoonful of carraways ; 
put a spoonful or two of cream into a cup of yeast, and as much 
good milk as will make the above into a light paste. Set it to 
rise by a fire till the oven be ready. They will quickly bake 
on tins. 

For richer JBuns. — Mix 1^ lb. of dried flour with t lb. of 
sugar, melt 1 lb. and 2 oz. of butter in a little warm water, 
add 6 spoonfuls of rose-water, and knead the above into a liglit 
dough with -^ pint of yeast ; then mix in 5 oz. of carraway 
comfits, and put some on them. 

Cross Buns. — Take 4 lbs. of flour, rub in -j lb. of butter, 
warm a quart of milk, and mix with -j pint of good light 
yeast ; pour this into the middle of the flour, and mix it into a 

* The common sort of waffle-irons, which bake but two at once, are much 
^tiQ best ; they may be got of any of the Jewish ironmongers. 



544 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVri. 

thin batter ; cover it over, and let it stand to rise ; then add 
10 oz. of moist sugar and a teaspoonful of ground allspice ; 
work the dough with more warm milk if required, and put the 
buns on buttered tins ; set them in a warm place to prove ; 
when about half proved, cross them and brush them over with 
milk ; bake them in a quick oven, and when done wash them 
over again with milk. 

Madeira Buns. — ^Beat 8 oz. of butter to a cream, to which 
add 2 eggs long beaten. Have ready 14 oz. of flour, 6 oz. of 
lump-sugar sifted, k a nutmeg, 1 teaspoonful of sifted ginger, 
and a large spoonful of carraway-seeds, and, after mixing, 
work them well into the butter ; beat it ^ an hour ; then add 
a large wineglass of sherry. Bake in tin pattypans in a mode- 
rately quick oven. 

Spanish Buns. — Take 1 lb. of fine flour, rub into it i lb. of 
butter; add t lb. of sugar, the same of currants, a little nut- 
meg, mace, and cinnamon ; mix it with 5 eggs well beaten ; 
make this up into small buns, and bake them on tins 20 
minutes ; when half done brush them over with a little hot 
milk. 

Bath Buns. — The following is the original receipt : — To 
z lb. of fine flour put 4 yolks and 3 whites of eggs, with 
4 spoonfuls of solid yeast (care must be taken that it is not 
bitter). Beat it well in a bowl, and set it before the fire to 
rise. Then rub into 1 lb. of flour 10 oz. of good butter, put 
in h lb. of sugar, and carraway -comfits ; when the eggs ai-id 
yeast are pretty light, mix by degrees all well together, throw 
a cloth over it, and set it before the fire again to rise. Then 
make your buns, and when you have put them on the tins, 
brush them over with the yolk of e^^ and milk ; strew them 
with carraway-comfits, and bake them in a quick oven. 

A rich Scotch Bun. — 4 lbs. of flour {half a peck of 
Scotch), 2 lbs. of raisins stoned and cut, and 2 lbs. of cur- 
rants. Take 6 oz. of orange-peel, the same of citron, and of 
almonds blanched and cut ; mix all these together. Take 
1 drachm of cloves, a large nutmeg, ^ oz. of allspice, and the 
same of ginger ; pound them, strew the spice on the fruit, and 
mix them very well. Make a hole in the flour, break in nearlj^ 
li lb. of butter, pour warm water on the butter to soften it a 
little; then work the flour and butter together, spread the 
paste, and pour in i pint of good yeast ; work it up very well 



Chap. XXYII. GINGERBEEAD. 54.5 

until the paste is light and smooth. Cut off about a third part 
of the paste for the sheets, spread out the rest of the paste on 
the ta,ble, put the fruit on it, pour about a gill of yeast over 
the fruit and paste, and work the fruit and paste very well 
together. Then make it up round ; roll out the sheet which 
was reserved in a circular form, lay the bun on the middle, and 
gather the sheet round it ; roll it out to the desired thickness, 
run a fork through in different parts down to the bottom, and 
pinch it on the top. Flour double grey paper and put the 
bun upon it, give it a cut round the side, put a binder of 
double paper round it to keep it from running too thin in the 
oven. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Or : — For the 'plainer sort, to 2 lbs. of flour add 1 lb. of 
butter, melt the butter, and make the flour into dough with 
it and about a gill of good yeast. Make it into cakes h inch 
in thickness, adding J lb. of lump-sugar beaten, and 1^ oz. of 
carraway-seeds on the top. Let the dough lie on the table 
after it is cut out until it becomes stiff, which will not take 
long, and then put it into the oven. 



GIXGERBFtEAD. 

799. — This is amongst the most ancient species of cake 
Known throughout England and the north of Europe. In this 
country it is rarely eaten, except by children ; but in Holland 
it is the common accompaniment of the ''^ schnapps ;" and in 
Ghent there are shops as famous for it as our " Leman " for 
biscuits. The following are selected from amongst the nume- 
rous ways of making it : — 

Take 1 lb. of treacle, 1 lb. of butter, 2 lbs. of flour, 1 oz. of 
ground ginger, sliced candied orange, and a glass of brandy. 
If not intended to be rich, omit i the butter, the brandy, anc' 
lemon, and make it of rye-flour, household flour, or oatmeal. 
At Leeds it is made v/ith equal quantities of oatm.eal and! 
treacle, mixed v.itii an eighth part of melted butter and brown 
sugar, and 1 oz. of powdered ginger, with ^ that quantity of 
other spice, to 4 lbs. of meal. This is called in that neighbour- 
hood " Parkin^^ and is made in almost every cottage on the 
0th of November, and pieces sent about as presents. 

The treacle sliould be perfectly sv/eet, for, if in the leaar 



546 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXYII. 

degree sour or too thick, the bread will be indiflferent in flavour 
and appearance. Ginger, too, should be fresh ground, as it 
loses much of its strength by keeping. '\\Tien baked, the tin 
must be well buttered to make the cake come out ; and when 
done, a fork, if thrust into it, will come out clean. 

Another sort. — To f lb. of treacle beat 1 egg strained ; mix 
4 oz. of brown sugar, ^ oz. of ginger sifted ; of cloves, mace, 
allspice, nutmeg, i oz. t02:ether, beaten as fine as possible ; 
coriander and carraway seeds, each i oz. ; melt 1 lb. of butter, 
and mix with the above ; and add as much flour as will knead 
into a pretty stiflT paste ; then roll it out, and cut into cakes. 

Bake on tin plates in a quick oven. A little time will 
bake them. 

A good plain sort. — Mix 3 lbs. of flour with -j lb. of butter, 
4 oz. of brown sugar, t oz. of pounded ginger ; then make into 
a paste with li lb. of treacle warm. 

A good sort, without butter. — Mix 2 lbs. of treacle ; of 
orange, lemon, citron, and candied ginger, each 4 oz., all 
thinly sliced ; 1 oz. of coriander-seeds, 1 oz. of carraways, and 
1 oz. of ground ginger, in as much flour as will make a soft 
paste ; lay it in cakes on tin plates, and bake it in a quick oven. 
Keep it dry, and it will be good for some months. 

Imperial Gingerbread. — Rub 6 oz. of butter into f lb. of 
flour, then mix 6 oz. of treacle with a pint of cream carefully, 
lest it should turn the cream ; mix in i lb. of double-refined 
sugar, ^ oz. of powdered ginger, and 1 oz. of carraway -seeds ; 
stir the whole well together into a paste, cut it into shapes, and 
stick cut candied orange or lemon peel on the top. 

Lemon Gingerbread. — Grate the rinds of 2 or 3 lemons, 
and add the juice to a glass of brandy ; then mix the grated 
lemon in 1 lb. of flour, make a hole in the flour, pour in ^ lb. 
of treacle, ^ lb. of butter melted, the lemon-juice, and brandy, 
and mix all up together with ^ oz. of ground ginger and i oz. 
of cayenne pepper. 

Sugar Gingerbread. — 1 lb. of suaar, 1 lb. of flour, and 
4 eggs ; beat the sugar and eggs till they are white, then add 
a little ginger and rose-water and the flour. 

Thich Gingerbread, — The same ingredients are used as for 
t\i^ nuts, but the proportions are different. Use only sufficieJil 



Chap. XXA^I. GINGERBEEiD. 547 

treacle to knead the 2 lbs. of flour into a stiff dougli : 2 oz. of 
butter and the same quantity of sugar are sufficient. The whole 
of the ammonia evaporates during the process of baking. 

Another. — Rub ^ lb. of butter into 2 lbs. of flour ; add i lb. 
of brown sugar, 2 oz. of powdered ginger, ^ oz. of ground car- 
raway-seeds, and the same of carbonate of soda ; mix them 
well, then work them with 2 lbs. of treacle, and 3 eggs well 
beaten ; pour the mixture into shallow tins, filling them about 
half full. Bake 1^ hour in a moderate oven. 

GINGERBREA D-XUTS. 

800.— Take 2 lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of treacle, i lb. of butter, 
J lb. of sugar, i lb. of candied peel, 1 oz. of ground ginger, 
1 oz. of coriander and 1 oz. of carraway seeds, finely pounded ; 
mix all M'ell together. Just before it is put into the oven 
(which must be a moderate one) stir in i oz. of carbonate of 
ammonia, finely powdered ; if required lighter, ^ oz. may be 
used. Some persons use 1 oz. of pearlashes instead of the 
ammonia, but the latter is preferred. 

Or : — T lb. of flour, -f lb. of treacle, 1 teaspoonful of cay- 
enne pepper, 2 eggs, a little volatile salts, and 1 tablespoon- 
ful of coriander and carraway seeds. Make the treacle hot, 
and mix in the other ingredients ; then make them into nuts as 
above. 

The Yorhshire Receipt. — Mix ^ lb. of flour, the same 
quantity of butter and of brown sugar, with 3 oz. of ginger, a 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda rubbed into the flour, with as 
much treacle as will make it into a paste. Roll it out thin, 
and bake it for about 20 minutes in a slow oven. 

The Stfffolk Receipt. — Put 1 lb. of broAvn sugar and 1 lb. 
of honey, with ^ the rind of a lemon grated, into a saucepan, 
and simmer them well together ; then add 4 oz. of good fresh 
butter and 1 oz. of ginger ; mix the whole with 2 lbs. of flour. 

These two receipts have been strongly recommended. 

With Carraway Seeds. — Take \i lb. of fine flour well dried, 
add 1 oz. of pounded ginger, ^ oz. of carraway seeds, and \ lb. 
of coarse sugar. Put h lb. of treacle and \ lb. of fresh butter 
in a pan, and when it boils mix it with the other ingredients 
into a stiff' paste, and set it before the fire to lighten ; then bake 
hi any form that may be desirable.

CHAPTER XXVIII. 

BREAD. 

On the making of bread a fev/ previous observations are ne- 
cessary. 

FLOUR. 

801. — TVitli regard to that most essential object the quality 
of thejiour., We need hardly insist that it shoukl not only be 
good but of the best corn, that being the best economy, both 
in point of price, and the kind, as well as quantity, of the 
bread made from it. 

Cheap bread must ever be of indifferent quality. The 
flour of which it is made is ahvays ground either from damaged 
wheat, or that of the most inferior kind, mixed by the miller 
with a little of the better sort, and made up by the baker with 
potato starch, alum, and soda, to render it apparently good. 

If you grow your own wheat, winnow it, screen it, scutch 
it, air it, and do not send it to the mill until 12 months old : 
even then, do not trust it to the miller, unless under your own 
eye or that of a confidential servant. 

The value of wheaten flour consists, besides its purity, in 
the quantity v/liich it contains of that portion of the grain 
termed " gluten," of which there is more in that grov/n in the 
southern climates than in those of the north ; which may in 
some degree account for the superiority ascribed to the Ame- 
rican flour imported into this country from Virginia.'' The 
flour should never be made from corn that is not some months 
old, and should be kept in a dry part of the house for a few 
weeks before being baked. 

Household Bread of ^^ery wholesome quality may be made 
with coarser flour, or even by merely screening off the out- 
ward bran of the w^heat, and making the whole into loaves, 
without sifting the flour into the different sorts of fineness. 
It is looked upon by medical men as a good remedy for in- 

* The American flour imbibes more water than the English on making it 
into bread ; for it has been stated, in comparative experiments, that a stone 
cf 14 lbs. weignt of the American flour will make 21 lbs. of bread, but the 
best sort of English flour only produces about 18 a lbs. 



Chap. XXVIII. YEAST. 54y 

digestion ; and the different effects created by the constant use 
of white or brown bread have been thus stated : — 

'• Mistaken notions respecting the quality of different sorts 
of bread have given rise to much waste. The general belief 
is, that the bread made of the finest flour is the best, and that 
whiteness is the proof of its quality : but both these opinions 
are popular eiTors. The whiteness may be, and generally is, 
communicated by alum, to the injury of the consumer ; and 
it is well known by men of science that the bread Oii unrefined 
flour will sustain life, while that made with the refined will 
not. Keep a man on brown bread and w"ater, and he will live 
and enjoy good health ; give him white bread and water only, 
and he will gradually sicken, and probably in a short time die."'* 

Brown Bread, wlien divested of the coarser bran, not only 
merits this preference in point of digestion, but is even 
thought to nourish better, as jDroved by the experience of 
sailors on long voyages, who are always furnished with bis- 
cuits made from unrefined flour, and are both strong and 
healthy. It should be made of unbolted wheat-meal, into 3 
quarts of which should be put a gill each of yeast and mo- 
lasses, with a quart of lukewarm water, and a tea spoonful of 
pearlash. This quantity will make as much as 2 loaves, when 
made in the usual mode of household bread. 

Bran, indeed, contains few nutritious parts, but then it 
contains the essential oil and the larger portion of the saline 
substances of the vegetable. The grain is furnished with two 
membranes or husks, the second or inner of which is the 
principal seat of the oil ; and it is this oil which imparts that 
agreeable smell to brown bread so superior to white. In 
grinding the grain, a large portion of the first skin is dividec 
from the second, and mixes very intimately v/ith the rest ; the 
first is an indigestible husk, a great part of v/hich will be 
separated by rejecting a third part of the bran, or by scuffling 
it rapidly in a circular turning machine of wire, the motion of 
which throws off the outer husk ; the finer parts, being thus 
intermixed, greatly facilitate the digestion of the bread by 
dividing its more glutinous pulp. 

YEAST. 

802. — As to Yeast or Yest, or as some people call it 
" barm," there can be no doubt that the best is that taken 

* ' Literary Gazette.* 



550 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVIII. 

from good brewers' ale, which not only causes the dough to 
rise with more certainty than any other composition, but also 
imparts to the bread a slight aromatic bitter of a \ery agree- 
able flavour. This, however, cannot always be got, and. 
although yeast of a good quality may generally be found at 
most country oil-shops, we here add a few receipts for those 
who prefer having it made at home : premising that, as these 
are not so strong as the brewers' yeast, a larger quantity must 
be used. 

To 4 oz. of malt and 2 oz. of hops put a quart of boiling 
water, and let it remain boiling for 20 minutes, then strain 
the liquor to 8 oz. of flour ; cover it until it ferments, and use 
it when it rises. 

Patent Yeast. — The following is copied from the original 
specification in the patent-office, from which was introduced 
the system, still in use amongst bakers, of making a ferment 
with potatoes for raising dough, instead of what was termed 
" quarter-sponges :" — 

" To make a yeast-gallon of this composition, such yeast- 
gallon containing 8 beer-quarts, boil in common water 8 lbs. 
of potatoes, as for eating : bruise them perfectly smooth, and 
mix with them, while warm, 2 oz. of fine honey, and 1 beer- 
quart of common yeast. For making bread, mix 3 beer-pints 
of the above composition with a bushel of flour, using warm 
water in making the bread : the water to be warmer in winter 
than in summer, and the composition to be used in a few 
hours after it is made ; and so soon as the sponge, or the 
mixture of the composition with the flour, begins to fall the 
first time, the bread should be made and put into the oven." 

Persons who are in the habit of making their own bread 
can easily manufacture their own yeast, by attending to the 
following directions : — 

Boil 1 lb. of good flour, i lb. of brown sugar, and h oz. of 
salt, in 2 gallons of water for an hour ; when nearly cold, 
bottle it, and cork it close, and it will be fit for use in 24 
hours. 1 pint will make 18 lbs. of bread. 

THE OVEN. 

803. — For the baking of bread there can be no doubt the 
fire-proof brick oven is the best. 

It should be round, not long ; the roof from 20 to 24 inches 
high, the mouth small, and the door of iron to shut close. 



Ceap. XXVITI. 07EN. 651 

This construction will save firing and time, and bake better 
than long and high-roofed ovens. 

Brick ovens are also the best for baking all kinds of large 
cakes and pies ; the reason of which is chiefly owing to their 
being generally capable of retaining the heat a much longer 
time than one built of iron ; unless, indeed, when the latter 
happens to be very substantially made of wrought iron. When 
this is the case, they serve all the purposes for a private 
family. "We have had one in constant use for the last 30 years : 
it is set separately from the kitchen fire, and occupies no more 
space than a small boiler would. Four tins, being made to fit 
in without touching the sides, will hold each a loaf of 4 lbs. 
A fire-proof tile should be placed under the tins to prevent 
the bread burning at the bottom, and, when half done, the 
loaves should be changed, the front ones to the back, as there 
will be the greatest heat : the fire is under the oven, and, 
after having been once lighted, should be supplied only by 
cinders, ivetted, and a small quantity of small coal mixed with 
them. 

For the baking of pastry, light bread, rolls, and breakfast- 
cakes, the iron ovens fixed in the usual kitchen ranges have 
the advantage of requiring but little fire, and enabling the 
cook to regulate its temperature, so as to increase or diminish 
its power ; but a still better may be found in the Frencl* move- 
able oven, for which see Xo. 767. 

MAKING BREAD. 

804. — Put the necessary quantity of good flour — say -g- 
bushel — into a kneading-trough, or broad earthen pan, and 
make a large hole in the middle of the heaj). Have ready a 
quart of warm water and stir it into a pint of brewers' yeast, 
or, if home-made, a larger quantity ; then pour it througii 
a sieve into the hole, and, with a large wooden spoon, work, 
it round so as to bring it to a batter of moderate toughness, 
and, when that is done, sprinkle oyer it a large handful of 
flour, so as to commence what is called " setting the sponge ;'' 
then cover it with a cloth or board, and leave it to rise in a 
warm place : the sponge will rise enough in the course of 2 
hours. A¥hen it has risen so high as to crack the flour on the 
top, put ^\h. of salt into a quart of water a little warmer 
than new milk ; let the salt be thoroughly melted, or it is 
liable to settle in lumps, which would spoil the bread : pour 



552 MODERIT DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVIIl. 

this water into the batter, and mix it well before taking in 
any of the flour, as this ensures the bread being uniformly 
light ; then prepare another jug of water to use if wanted. 
That done, knead the dough well, turning it over, pressing it, 
folding it, and working it thoroughly with your clenched 
hands, for at least i an hour, or until it becomes light as well 
as stiff, and until all the flour is worked up. When done, the 
dough should be of such a consistency as not to stick to the 
hand. Remember that the goodness of the bread will greatly 
depend on the kneading, which requires both strength and 
practice. If baked in an iron oven, the dough should at once 
be rolled up and put into the tins, leaving it to rise in a v»^arm. 
place till nearly at the top of the tins, which should then at 
once be placed in the oven. A loaf of 4 lbs. will take about 
2 hours to bake it. If the oven is well set it will be sufficiently 
heated during the time the bread is being made : dredge a 
little flour in ; if it changes colour it is hot enough. 

The loaves may be made of any form and size you please : 
for a small family, the ^ quartern, or 2 lb. loaf, is the most 
convenient, but the full quartern is the most common, and, 
in large establishments, where household bread is used, peck 
loaves are not unusual. The bread, if unexposed to the air, 
and kept in earthen, closely-covered pans, in a cool spot, will 
remain sufficiently fresh for a week, and any appearance of 
staleness may be removed by slightly damping the outside of 
the loaf, and putting it for a short time into the oven. 

If the oven be of brick, it should be heated by faggots, and 
will be sufficiently hot in about 4 hours ; when the dough is 
ready, clear out the ashes, and sweep the floor clean for its 
reception. If necessary to lessen the heat, take an old broom, 
dip it in water, and hold it in the oven, twirling it round 
until it becomes dry. Try the heat of the bottom by throwing 
in some flour ; and if it scorches or turns black, do not ven- 
ture to put in the bread till the oven has had time to become 
cooler. 

When the loaves are put in the oven close up the door, 
and do not open it more than once or twice, for a moment, 
just to see how the process is going on. The loaves will take 
from 2i to 3 hours baking, or more if their size be large ; 
and, as a portion of the dough is frequently made up into rolls 
or twists, they must, of course, be removed earlier. 

Cottage Bread, if meant for the breakfast-table, is belter 



Chap. XXVIII. BKEAD. 55S 

baked in tins ; and if made with a portion of milk, v,ill be 
more delicate ; but milk used in household-bread will be apt 
in a few days to turn it sour. 

In the making of either sort, if a tenth or a twelfth part of 
potato-flour be employed, it will improve their lightness and 
colour ; and if, in the mixing of the dough, bran be boiled i.i 
the water used in making it, it will be found to impart a fine 
flavour of corn to the bread. Not only will this be the fact, 
but it has been calculated that if 5 lbs. of bran be boiled in 
water, then strained off, and the water used in kneading 56 
lbs. of flour with the usual quantity of salt and yeast, the 
dough will weigh about 94 lbs. 13 oz. ; or 8 lbs. 10 oz. more 
than if kneaded with pure water. 

Fa7nily Bread. — A sack of good flour weighing 280 lbs. 
ought to produce on an average rather more than 360 lbs. of 
excellent white bread, if well kneaded and properly baked, 
and that v/ithout any other addition ; though a little soda, or 
a very small quantity of magnesia, will assist in enabling the 
dough to rise, and thus increase the lightness of the bread ; 
but alum, though it improves the colour, will occasion it to 
dry up sooner ; bakers who make the best bread, indeed, rarely 
use it, and then only in case of some discoloration in the 
flour, which, if good and v/ell dressed, produces bread suffi- 
ciently white without any foreign admixture whatever. 

FER3IENTED AND UNFER3IENTED BREAD. 

805. — The attention of the public, and economists in par- 
ticular, has, within the last few years, been directed towards 
the method of making unfermented bread ; and its supposed 
superiority over fermented bread has been much extolled in a 
pamphlet lately published by " A Physician," "" who estimates 
the loss in weight by this decomposition to be, in the London 
bread, 13 per cent.; and, according to M. Dumas, as quoted 
by him, to be in the Paris bread l7y^o P^r cent. : " the waste 
varies somewhat, according to the degree to which the fer- 
mentation has been excited, and its duration ;" — in which the 
Doctor is right ; for the ^vaste, or loss of weight, will be in 
proportion to the duration of the fermentation, which must be 
sufficiently excited and continued to produce a well-made

loaf ; beyond this there is no necessity for extending the fer- 
mentation, and if checked at this stage the bread will be sweer 
and well tasted, indeed more so than that produced by the 
chemical means. 

Bakers, in order to please the eye of the public, carry the 
fermentation of their bread to the greatest possibfe extent, 
almost approaching the acetous state, so as to have a very 
white, large, and well-piled loaf of bread, with which alone 
the public will be satisfied. 

In the Rev. Mr. Haggett's Economical Bread, only the 
coarse flake bran is to be removed from the flour : of this bran 
take 5 lbs., and boil it in rather more than 4 gallons of water, 
so that when perfectly smooth you may have 3 gallons and 3 
quarts of bran-water clear. With this knead 56 lbs. of the 
flour, adding salt and yeast in the same way and proportions 
as for other bread. Vf hen ready to bake, divide it into loaves 
and bake them 2^ hours. 

"VYe do not, howe\'er, uphold this mode so much on the 
principle of economy, as on that of the quality of the bread 
made with water in which bran has been boiled, as we Imow 
from long experience that wheaten bread made in this manner 
always has a sweeter taste of corn than when made from 
pure water. 

Maize Bread. — Take an equal quantity of the meal of 
maize and wheaten flour. Set a sponge first with three parts 
of the wheaten flour, the requisite quantity of yeast, warm 
v.^ater, and salt. Whilst this is rising, mix the maize-meal 
up with water, and boil it over the fire, keeping it well stirred 
till it comes to the consistence of paste, and let it cool. When 
the sponge has risen to its greatest height, and begins to drop 
or sink down again, then add the meal paste ; mix and knead 
them both well together, using the rest of the wheaten flour 
left from the sponge in the kneading with a sufficient quantity 
of water to make the whole of a proper consistency. Put the 
dough into a pan, cover it with a thick cloth or flannel, and 
let it remain in a warm place or before the fire to prove for 
1-1- or 2 hours, then divide it into loaves and bake. The maize, 
having no gluten in it, can only be rendered in any degree 
light by a large admixture of wheaten flour. 

Eye-bread may be made in the same manner as wheaten, 
and if both be mixed, as meslin, it has a very agreeable 



Chap. XXYIII. EOLLS. 5oo 

flavour, approaching to acidity. The grain, though dark- 
coloured, and the flour very brown, yet forms excellent bread 
at half the price of that made of wheat, and very far superior 
to that of maize. It is, indeed, the only bread consumed by 
the peasantry of Geiniiany, who form as healthy a population 
as is found in any part of Europe. 



EOLLS, BEEAKFAST-CAKES, &c. 
ROLLS, 

806. — French Rolls are usually made by the bakers, but 
in country houses, where families bake their own bread, they 
may be done in either of the following ways : — 

Sift 1 lb. of flour, and rub into it 2 oz. of butter ; mix in 
the whites of 3 eggs beaten to a froth, and a tablespoonful 
of strong yeast ; add enough of milk, Avith a little salt, to 
make a stiff dough, and set it, covered, before the fire to rise 
— which will take about an hour ; if cut into small rolls, and 
put into a quick oven, they will be done in little more than 10 
minutes. 

Or : — Take i peck of the very finest flour, 1 oz. of butter 
melted in milk and water : mix with it 2 or 3 spoonfuls of 
yeast, according to its strength, and strain it through a hair 
sieve ; whisk the white of an egg and work it into a light 
paste, add salt, and leave it all night. Then work it up well 
again, and make it into rolls. 

English Rolls. — Sift 1 lb. of flour into a pan, and mix 
with it a small teaspoonful of salt. Warm a gill of milk 
and water ; make a hole in the middle of the flour and put 
into it a gill of brewers' yeast, making it all into a thin 
batter, which must be stirred until quite free from lumps : 
then strew a handful of flour over it ; set it in a warm place, 
and leave it to rise, which will take 2 hours or more ; let it, 
however, remain until it has cracked on the top, and then 
make it into a dough with more milk and water. Knead it 
well for 10 minutes, cover it, and set it again to rise for 20 
minutes longer. Then form the dough into small rolls, bake 
them, and send them to table hot. 

Or : — To 2 lbs. of flour well dried, and 1 pint of water 
milk-warm, put 3 spoonfuls of vcast : then knead in 2 oz. ol 

2b2 



556 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXVm. 

fresh butter and a little salt, and work all well together. The 
oven must be very quick, and ^ of an hour will bake them ; 
the dough should make 12 rolls. 

Or : — H lb. of flour, a i^int of milk, 1 egg, and 2 spoonfuls 
of yeast, well mixed and set before the fire to rise, will make 
still nicer rolls, and 20 minutes will bake them. They should 
be served hot, cut in 3, buttered, put together again, and 
covered when brought to table. 

ROCKS, 

807. — Take a loaf that is half-baked, pull it apart, and with 
2 forks tear the crumb into bits about the size of a walnut ; 
lay them on a tin and return them to the oven, and bake of a 
light brown. A loaf made for the purpose with milk and a 
little butter makes them nicer. A sweet cake pulled in this 
way is very good. 

BREAKFAST- CAKES. 

808. — Muffins. — Take 2 eggs, 2 spoonfuls of new yeast, 
and a little salt. Mix a little warm new milk and water into 
a quart of flour. Beat all well together, and let it stand 
to rise. Bake them for about 20 minutes, until of a light 
brown, either on a hot iron, or in shallow tin pans in a Dutch 
oven. When to be brought to table, toast them slightly on 
both sides, but not in the middle : then notch them round the 
centre, and pull them open with your fingers, without using a 
knife, and butter them. 

I . Crumpets. — Beat 2 eggs very well, put to them a quart of 
warm milk and water, and a large spoonful of yeast ; beat in 
as much fine flour as will make them rather thicker than a 
common batter pudding ; then make the stove hot, or the iron 
cover of a bain-marie very hot, and rub it with a little butter 
wrapped in a clean linen cloth ; pour a large spoonful of the 
batter upon the iron, and let it run within a ring to the size 
of a teasaucer; turn them with the elastic blade of an old 
table-knife ; and when you want to use them, toast them very 
quickly, but not too crisply, and butter them. 

Leicestershire Pikelet. — Mix a pint of milk with flour 
sufficient to make a thick batter ; add 4 eggs, 1 tablespoonful 
of good fresh yeast, a small quantity of nutmeg, and a little 
salt. The whole to be beaten up together for 10 minutes, 
then left to stand 2 hours to rise. Bake on a girdle-stone- 



Chap. XXVIII. BREAKFAST-CAKES. 557 

and butter eacli whilst hot — laying 3 or 4 on the same plate. 
Those which are kept to the following day should be laid 
separately on a clean cloth as they are baked, and when to be 
eaten, toast and butter them like crumpets. 

A Sally-Lunn, when eaten hot and well buttered, is a very 
favourite accompaniment of the breakfast or tea table, and 
may be made in either of these ways : — 

Into 1 pint of flour rub a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, a little salt, and a little yeast. Let it rise h an hour 
before the fire. Then mix it with 2 eggs, and if not enough 
add a little milk ; knead the dough well, and let it stand 
some minutes before the fire ; after which, make this quan- 
tity into 5 cakes and have them slack-baked, as they must 
be well warmed in a Dutch oven before being toasted for 
table. 

Or : — Put 1 oz. of butter into almost a pint of new milk, 
and make it blood-warm. Beat up 3 eggs well, add to them 3 
spoonfuls of good barm, and put in a little salt. Have 3 lbs. 
of fine flour well dried, pour in the above ingredients, and beat 
it up to the consistency of French bread. Lay it to sponge 
for 2 hours. Then pour it into a cake-pan. An hour will 
bake it. 

A very good hreahfast cake may also be made with i lb. of 
flour, 1 oz. of butter, and an e^^, made into a paste with a 
spoonful of milk and a very little salt : let it rise before the 
fire, and bake it quickly. Cut it in half, while quite hot, and 
butter it. It is commonly called " Yorkshire cake," but 
when strongly impregnated with saffron, mixed with a small 
quantity of sugar, it is very commonly used in Bath and in 
Dublin as " Saffron cake." 

In America buckivheat-cakes are in great vogue as a break- 
fast delicacy, and, according to Miss Leslie's receipt, are made 
thus : — 

" Take a quart of buckwheat meal, mix with it a teaspoonful 
of salt, and add — if you have it — a handful of Indian meal ; 
pour a large tablespoonful of the best brewers' yeast into the 
centre of the meal ; then mix it gradually with cold water till 
it becomes a batter. Cover it, put it in a warm place, and set 
it to rise : it will take about 3 hours. When it is quite light, 
and covered with bubbles, it is fit to bake. Put your griddle 



.558 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXYIII. 

over the fire and let it get quite hot before you begin. Grease 
it well with a piece of butter tied in a rag. Then dip out a 
large ladleful of the batter and bake it on the griddle, turning 
it with a broad wooden paddle. Let the cakes be of large 
size, and even at the edges. Butter them as you take them 
off the griddle ; put several on a plate, and cut them across 
in 6 pieces. Grease the griddle anew between baking each 
cake. 

" If your batter lias been mixed over night, and is found to 
be sour in the morning, melt in warm water a piece of pearl- 
ash the size of a grain of corn, or a little larger ; stir it into 
the batter, let it set for ^ an hour, and then bake it. The 
pearlash will remove the sour taste, and increase the lightness 
of the cakes." 

I?i Shreivshiiri/ they are made thus : — Take a quart or 3 
pints of lukewarm water ; put it into an earthen jar ; add a 
small portion of salt and a common teacupful of yeast. Then 
stir in the buckwheat flour until it becomes a thick batter, 
cover it, and set it to rise. When light, and in a state of 
fermentation, take a frying-pan, the inside rubbed with butter 
or good lard ; then place in the frying-pan 3 or 4 table- 
spoonfuls of the batter in each cake, until there are as many 
as the pan will contain. A few minutes over a quick fire will 
suffice to cook them in the same manner as the common pan- 
cake ; and when sufficiently cooked, butter them while quite 
hot, and serve them for breakfast. Buckwheat dressed in this 
manner will be foiuid excellent and very wholesome, but it 
does not answer in any other way. The batter takes 3 or 4 
hours to rise. 

Johnriy Cakes. — Sift a quart of wheaten flour, or corn meal, 
into a pan ; make a hole in the middle, and pour in a pint of 
warm water. Mix the meal and water gradually into a batter, 
adding a teaspoonful of salt ; beat it very quickly, and for a 
long time, till it becomes quite light • then spread it thick and 
even on a stout piece of smooth board ; place it upright on the 
hearth before a clear fire, with something to support tiie board 
behind, and bake it well ; cut it into squares, and split and 
butter them hot. 

They may also be made with a quart of milk, 3 eggs, 1 
teaspoonful of carbonate of soda, and 1 teacupful of wheaten 
flour ; add Indian corn meal sufficient to make a batter like 



CiiAr. XXYIII. BEE AKF AST-CAKES. 559 

that of pancakes, and either bake it in buttered pans, or upon 
a griddle, and eat them with butter.^ 

Pa^te Cake. — In Ireland hreakfast-cahes are baked on a 
g-riddle, or flat iron, placed on trivets over a cinder or turf 
fire, and the cake under the above title is there composed 
of flour and butter, just in the same manner as for a pie-crust, 
and therefore made as rich or as plain as you like. The paste 
is made a full inch thick, usually to the circumference of a 
dinner-plate. It is then placed upon the griddle, twice turned 
until done, when it is served hot, then divided and buttered, 
as each person may please. It is a very delicious but indi- 
gestible appendage to breakfast. 

Slim-cake is made simply of flour and milk, without butter, 
and baked in the same manner as the above, but always eaten 
cold, with butter. 

TOAST AND BUTTER. 

809. — In the making of dry and buttered toast there should 
be this difference : — Dry toast should be cut very thin, and held 
at a distance from the fire to render it crisp ; while buttered 
toast should not only be cut rather thick and placed near to 
the fire, to keep soft, but, for that purpose, held for a minute 
or two over a bowl of boiling water to imbibe the steam before 
being buttered. The toast should always be buttered on both 
sides, and the crusts cut offl If fresh butter be used, it must 
be accompanied with a niuflineer, to salt it, but most people 
prefer the flavour of really good salt butter. 

Take 2 lbs. of fine flour, after being gently warmed before 
the fire, and rub into it ^ pint of warm mealy potatoes. When 
well mixed, add a proper quantity of yeast and salt with 
warm milk and water sufl[icient to make into dough, which 
must be allowed 2^ hours to rise before being formed into 
a loaf: which put into a tin to preserve its shape,, and 
v/hen placed in the oven take care that it be not over- 
browned.^ 

On this. Dr. Hunter, from whom we copy the above, ob- 
serves, " tiiat the lovers of toast and butter will be much 
pleased with this kind of bread. The potato is not here 
added with a view to economy, but to increase the lightness of

GRILLADES. 

810. — Perhaps there is no better grill for breakfast than a 
tvjld hlade-hone of mutton, off which the greater part of the 
meat has been already cut. The remaining parts should then 
be scored, and the gashes filled with a mixture of mustard, 
cayenne, common pepper, and salt, as for a devil : it should 
then be put upon the gridiron, and well browned, but not 
burnt. It may be sent to table dry, without any sauce, or 
served with gravy mixed with capers. 

The bones of cold foicl of all kinds are also frequently 
brou2:ht thus to breakfast. 

Broiled Chicken. — SjDlit open an uncooked chicken, pepper 
it only on the inside, put it on the gridiron over a moderate 
fire, and when perfectly done on both sides serve it up quite 
hot, just touched over with a very little butter, and accom- 
panied with broiled mushrooms. 

Another broil. — ^Put thin slices of well-seasoned kidney anc! 
bacon, with beef or mutton between, upon skewers. Have ready 
fine bread-crumbs, with a slight grating of lemon, brush them 
over with Q^^, and roll them in the crumbs. Hang up the skewers 
to roast in a toaster, and put a slice of toast under it to secure 
tiie gravy : when served, carefully remove the skewers, and 
place the " kabobs " on the toast ; but, if only a quantity suffi- 
cient to help one person be put on each skewer, then do not 
remove them. 

If, instead of meat, an oyster be 
put between each slice of bacon and 
kidney, it will be found very supe- 
rior. 

As to bloaters and finnan-had- 
dock, they are too well known to 
need any description ; dried salmo7i 
or a fresh mackerel, split open and 
broiled, is likewise a good relish. 

Steaks or a grill may be easily

few sheets of waste paper only in the " conjurer." Take off 
the cover and place the meat with a small piece of butter under 
it. Insert the lighted paper in the opening- at the bottom, 
and in 8 or 10 minutes a moderate sized steak will be done. 
This is a particularly useful machine to young men whose 
hours are irregular, as there is a kettle fitted to the top by 
which a pint of water may be boiled by the same means in a 
few minutes. The machine costs only a few shillings. 

SAVOURY TOASTS. 

811 . — German Toast. — Take the remainder of any fricassee 
or ragoiit ; any quantity will do : chop it finely, add a little 
chopped parsley, and a little bit of shaiot or chive ; mix it 
up with 1 or 2 eggs beaten, according to the quantity. Put 
the whole with its gravy into a stewpan, and 'let it reduce and 
thicken on the fire. Let it remain until it is cold, then cut 
pieces of bread, toast them : lay the mixture thickly upon 
them. Boil an q^^^ hard, cut it into small pieces, and stick 
them on the top ; brush the whole with e^^ beaten up, sift 
bread-crumbs o\ev, and bake thein in the oven ; squeeze a 
little lemon-juice on the top. This makes also a good corner 
dish for dinner. 

Vegetable Toast. — Take any stewed vegetable, and make 
it into a puree. Add a little more seasoning, mix it up with 
the yolk of an Qg^, and, if too thin, reduce and thicken it 
(jver the fire, then spread it upon toast, brush it over with 
beaten Q^^^, add bread-crumbs or vermicelli, and fry or bake 
them. 

Ancliovy Toast. — Make a well -buttered toast of hroivn 
bread, if you can get it ; scale and bone a proper number of 
anchovies, with little or no washing; cut them into broad 
slices, and place them upon the toast, seasoning it with mustard, 
without pepper. 

Or : — Butter a round of toast, v/ash and bone 8 anchovies, 
chop them fine, add a bit of butter the size of a walnut, and a 
moderate quantity of cayenne ; vrork the whole into a paste, 
spread it o^-er the toast, and hold it before the fire until it is 
warm through. 

Sausage Toast. — Make a toast, fry 2 or 3 sausages ; when 
quite hot, strip off the skins and spread the meat upon the 
toast, which should not only be made, if possible, of brown 

2b 3

bread, but also buttered with salt butter; season it with a 
little pepper and mustard. It will be improved by a grating- 
of Gruyere, Parmesan, or old Cheshire cheese. 

Kidney Toast. — Take a cold veal kidney, with a part of the 
fat cut it into very small pieces ; pound the fat in a mortar 
with a little salt, white pepper, and an onion previously boiled. 
Bind all together with the beaten whites of eggs. Heap it 
upon toast, cover the whole with the yolks beaten, dredge with 
bread-crumbs, and bake in the oven. 

Horn Toast. — Grate or pound the cold ham ; toast and butter 
a slice of bread ; mix the ham with the yolk of an e^g and a 
little cream, until it is thick and rich ; warm it over the fire, 
and serve it very hot upon the toast. Tongue may be em- 
ployed in the same way. 

Scotch Woodcock. — Toast and butter 3 or 4 slices of bread 
on both sides ; take 9 or 10 anchovies, washed, scraped, and 
chopped fine, and put them between the slices of bread. Beat 
the yolks of 4 eggs in ^ pint of cream, and set it on the fire 
to thicken, but not to boil. Then pour it over the toast, and 
send it to table as hot as possible. This may, however, be 
diminished at pleasure ; as one slice of bread of a moderate- 
sized loaf, 1 Qg^, and 2 or 3 anchovies, may be sufficient. 

SHEEP'S RU3IPS AND KIDNEYS. 

812. — Boil the rumps in gravy, and lard the kidneys with 
bacon ; set them, along with tne i-umps, before the fire in a 
small tin oven, rubbing them at the same time with yolk of 
egg and a little cayenne and nutmeg. When of a light brown, 
dish them up, either dry or with any pungent sauce, and 
garnish tliem with green parsley. 

Or : — Stew them until tender, then put them for a few 
minutes into a pan with 2 or 3 oz. of boiled rice seasoned with 
ketchup or mushroom powder, and give a light boil, with 2 
large spoonfuls of good crpam or milk thickened Avith flour 
and butter. Lay the rumps in the centre of the rice, putting 
^ a kidney between each rump. A pretty garnish is either red 
cabbaofe or barberries. 

/ DEVILS.— E.R. 

813. — Of Biscuits. — Butter thin "captain's biscuits" on 
both sides, or oil them with a feather ; sprinkle cayenne pepper 
on the top, and grill them. This may be varied by tlie addi^ 



Chap. XXYIII. SAVOURY DISHES FOR BREAKFAST. 563 

tioii of chopped anchovies, or the essence, diavoio paste, or 
Chetney. 

Or : — Make a slice of clieese into a paste with made mus- 
tard, and lay it upon one side. 

A dry Devil. — ^Take the liver, gizzard, drumstick, and side 
bones of a fowl or turkey ; score them ; lay on made mustard 
very thickly, and add a quantity of cayenne pepper and salt, 
and broil them. 

A wet Devil. — Take any part of a turkey, goose, or fowl, 
cover it with mustard, Chetney, diavoio paste, or any other 
piquant condin.ent ; put a dessertspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
one of pounded white sugar, the juice of a lemon, a glass of 
wine, and a glass of ketchup, to a teacupful of gravy ; heat them 
together, pour over the devilled fowl, and send up very hot. 

A little cold fresh butter v/ill cool the mouth, should the 
grill prove too powerful. 

DEVILLED GAME. 

814. — Split a woodcock, snipe, wild duck, or any other 
game that is underdone. To a teaspoonful of salt add a 
dessertspoonful of cayenne pepper with a tablespoonful of 
curry-powder, and wet* the whole with French mustard. Cover 
the birds both inside and out with this mixture. Take out the 
brains when the head is split, and, if a woodcock, add the trail ; 
make them into a paste with the yolk of a hard-boiled ^^'g, 
^ a blade of pounded mace, a saltspoonful of grated lemon- 
peel, and season it with essence of anchovies, ketchup, or other 
sauce ; then add a glass of wine, a teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, a dessertspoonful of pounded white sugar, and the 
jidce of a lemon or of a Seville orange. Roll a bit of butter, 
the size of a walnut, in flour; put the birds and the sauce into 
a metal dish over a lamp, cover it close, shake it al)out occa- 
sionally, and when it has stewed until the greater part of the 
sauce has been imbibed, serve it round. The legs of fowls, 
geese, and turkeys, may be devilled the same way. 

Or : — Mix equal parts of fine salt, cayenne pepper, and 
curry-powder, with double the quantity of powder of truffles. 
Dissect a woodcock or any bird in season, rather under roasted, 
and powder the whole with the mixture ; crush the trail and 
brains along with the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, the grated* 
peel of a lemon, ^ a spoonful of Chetney sauce, and a little soy ; 
then add a tablespoonful of ketchup, a winea^lass of JMadeira,

— may be had in a pure state at Apothecaries' Hall. 

In making it, pure water is most generally used, with a 
pinch of salt and sugar, though both are frequently omitted ; 
but a much better mode for preserving it, as well as adding to 
it a good flavour, is to make it of water in which horseradish 
has been boiled. This costs no trouble ; for if the horseradish 
be scraped and put in a teacup with boiling water poured upon 
it and covered, the infusion will be strong enough in little 
more than ^ an hour. 

The Parisian mustard, known as moidarde de Maille, is 
however much in vogue among gastronomists, as possessing a 
ilner pungency of flavour, and may be imitated by mixing up 
the flour and a little fine salt with salad-oil, so as to form a 
thick paste, then diluting it to a certain degree with equal 
quantities of the vinegars of horseradish, taiTagon, chili, and 
garlic ; or sufficient of each to please tlie palate. Cayenne 
should never be used, and even chili vinegar but sparingly.

for this reason, that every one believes he can cut sandwiches. 
Where any quantity is required the bread should be made on 
purpose, and the baker should be desired to bake it in tins, 
and either add a little butter to it or prove it well before it is 
put into the tins, so that it should not be fidl of holes, as in 
that case too much butter is used, and the sandwich becomes 
disagreeable from being greasy. Cut the bread moderately 
thin, butter it very slightly indeed, lay the meat cut thin, 
season A\'ith salt, pepper, and mustard, as may be required ; 
cover with a second slice of bread, trim the edges, put tliem 
one on the other, and cover with a damp cloth until wanted.

CHAPTER XXIX. 
COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE. 

817. — Either coffee, tea, or chocolate, forms the constant 
beverage of our English ]}reakfast ; and the two former are 
also such a common evening refreshment that it would be un- 
pjydonable to pass them over without remark. 

Formerly cofiiee was hardly ever seen at the breakfast-table 
in England, and was, indeed, only rarely brought forward 
in the evening, except for a party, and along with tea. It 
was also then made insufferably weak — consequently bad — 
and without any knowledge either of the proper mode of pre- 
paring it, or care for the original quality of the berry ; which 
ought to be rather pale in colour, small in size, and of a 
roundish form. 

Nothing can be more grateful to the stomach, or more 
favourable to digestion, than a cup of good strong coffee 
— or, as the French call it, cafe noir — soon after dinner ; and 
if it be followed by a small glass of liqueur, as chasse cafe, it 
will be found' equally agreeable to the palate. Still, however, 
tliere is much to be learned respecting the best mode of pre- 
paring it ; and as this is more scientifically done in Paris than 
in London, we here offer a few directions on the subject. 

Independently of the mode of making, the coffee should 
be of good quality, or the flavour will suffer in proportion to 
its inferiority. The IMocha is the best, and the Java good ; 
but the sorts most commonly used in this country are the 
Jamaica and the Berbice, wliich are both excellent when well 
chosen and undamaged. 

To this must be added the age to which it should be kept : 
for, if used soon after being gathered, it has an unpleasant 



566 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY, Chap. XXIX. 

coarseness of flavour. In those countries where it is grown 
it is seldom used until 3 years old ; and if older will be all 
the better. It should always be exposed to the air, and kept 
very dry. The best mode is, to buy it raw, and keep it for a 
long time — even years — without using it ; only roasting it at 
the time it is wanted ; and that operation should be performed 
by Orpwoo(Vs roasting machine^ which is fixed on the bars of 
a grate, and roasts \ lb. of coffee without trouble, and with 
great regularity, in less than i of an hour ; it is far superior 
to the coffee-roaster which is heated by a lamp. 

The roasted berries should then be put into a bag of flannel 
to cool and prevent the escape of the aroma ; after which grind 
them. If not used soon after it is ground, the powder should 
be wrapped up and put before the fire or in the oven to get 
hot. When the berry has been roasted at the grocer's, it should 
be warmed before it is ground. 

Tlie French mode of making. — As much of the powder 
should be used as one to every 3 cups of the liquid to he 
made, Cvud placed in the upper part of the common French 
machine, called a grecque, w hich may be got at any of the 
tin-shops. It is merely a coffee-pot with an upper receptacle 
made to fit close into it, the bottom of which is perforated with 
holes, and containing in its interior 2 moveable metal strainers, 
over the second of which the coffee is to be placed, and imme- 
diately under the third ; upon the upper strainer pour boiling 
water, until it bubbles up through the strainer ; then shut the 
cover close down, place it near the fire, or upon the hob c^ a 
parlour grate ; and so soon as the water is drained through 
the coffee, repeat the operation until the whole intended quan- 
tity is pavSsed. The top of the machine may then be removed, 
and the coffee may be served in the pot in which* it has been 
made, or in any other, only taking care that it shall first be 
warmed with hot water, and that the coffee itself be brought up 
strictly hot. 

This is the true Parisian method, and it requires neither 
isinglass nor clearings of any description, as it will come to 
table quite transparent. 

A patent lias, however, lately been taken out under the title 
of '• Platow's Automaton Coffee Urn," which perfectly clarifies 
the coffee, and can be made an elegant appendage to the table 
(see cut No. 1). If the upper vessel is made of glass, it is then 
an interesting- process to make the coffee in the drawing-room. 



Chap. XXIX. 



COFFEE

instead of having it made in the kitchen, which, for some reason 
or other, very seldom sends out a good cup of coffee. It is 
heated by a spirit lamp. The coffee-pot shown in cut No. ^Z is 
upon the same principle, but can be set upon the fire, as botn 
vessels are of block-tin. The upper vessel screws on : this is 
taken off*, and the water put into the lower vessel ; the upper 
vessel is then screwed on again, and the dry coffee put into it. 
Set it on the fire, or place the lamp under it, and the water 
will boil up through the dry coffee. Just stir it that every 
part of the coffee may be wetted, let it boil for 3 minutes, 
then take it off" the fire, or remove the lamp, and the coffee 
will gradually drain back to the lower vessel, leaving the 
grounds in the upper. This process is the most certain, the 
most economical, and produces the brightest coflfee of any we 
have ever tried ; and coffee being a favourite beverage, there 
is scarcely a plan proposed for making it which we have not 
tried, and decidedly think the " Plato w " the best. They are 
to be got at all the large furnishing ironmongers*.

One great art in making coflTee is to use a sufficient quantity 
of the powder ; for if not strong, the aroma of its flavour is 
lost in proportion to its state of weakness. 

Foreigners seldom drink more than 1 small cup of coffee 
after dinner, and that always without either milk or cream ; 
but as most English people like a mixture of the latter, the 
milk — if cream cannot be 'had — should always be boiled c.nd 



568 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEPtl. Ckap. XXiX. 

used hot, ii: a much larger quantity than cream ; but cream 
better preserves the flavour of the coffee. 

Milk Coffee is an excellent breakfast, and, as its name im- 
plies, is generally composed of -i- milk and 4 coffee : the coffee 
is made in the same maimer as for after dinner ; the boiling- 
milk may, however, be afterwards added according to fancy. 
If the yolk of a raw e^g be well mixed up ^^ ith i a pint of the 
milk, it will materially add to the richness of the coffee ; 
but soft sugar should then be used ; whereas the best refined 
lump or powdered sugar-candy should be taken in that which 
is to be drunk pure. For milk-coffee, always make the coffee 
as strong as in tlie French mode ; and weaken it as you please 
with milk. Should the plan be adopted of each person mixing" 
the milk and coffee according to their taste, an excellent uten- 
sil would be that of a small tea-urn, divided in the centre of 
its interior, to separate the liquids, but equally communicating 
tlie warmth of the heater ; it must have the addition of a cock 
on each side. 

As to the liquid essence of coffee^ the best sort is not a bad 
substitute, in a hurry, for that made in a proper way ; but it is 
not nearly so good. 

Mocha coffee can only be found at the shops of grocers of 
eminence, though every petty dealer puts off what he calls 
" Turkey coffee," as being the same. 

If you cannot roast the berries, at least grind them yourself, 
to prevent the imposition of a mixture. 

If induced by its cheapness to buy low-priced coffee, the 
coarseness of its flavour may be improved by the addition of a 
small quantity of chicory powder, at the rate of a couple of 
ounces to the pound. 



TEA. 

818. — Tastes differ reo-ardinar the flavour of various sorts of 
tea ; some preferring all black ; others, all green ; and many, 
a mixture of both in different quantities ; though most persons 
— when not fearful of their nerves — agree that fine Hyson is 
the best. A good mixture, in point of flavour, we know to 
be — I- black, -| green, and \ gunpowder : all being, of course, 
of superior quality. 

Presuming all ladies to be intimately acquainted with the 
mode of mailing tea, yet, to some, a few hints on the subject 
may not perhapa be found objectionable 



Chap. XXIX. TEA. o6Si 

First, never make it in any other than a highly-polished 
teapot, for it is a chemical fact that metal retains the heat 
longer than earthenware ; and the better it is polished, tlie 
more completely will the liquid be kept hot, and the essence 
of the tea be extracted. A silver teapot is decidedly the best ; 
for you will be sure that the metal is not mixed up with zinc 
or other materials of a pernicious nature. 

Secondly, see that the water be really boiling, not simmer- 
ing, as is too commonly the case when taken from an urn, but 
kept either on the fire until boiled, or in one of those metal 
teakettles warmed by a spirit lamp, as formerly used by our 
grandmothers, and now — thanks to good taste in tea-drinking 
— aG:ain cominsT into fashion. 

Having well scalded the teapot, then put in the tea, and 
pour over it about h of the water the pot will contain ; 
taking care to keep it as hot as possible for not less than 
10 minutes ; then fill up the pot, allow it to remain from 6 to 
8 minutes longer — though all green would require 5 minutes 
more — for we know, from long experience, that it requires 
that time to thoroughly draw it ; it may then be poured out ; 
but you should always be careful not to drain the pot to the 
very last cup. 

For 4 persons, each taking 2 large breakfast-cups, you will 
require nearly an ounce of good mixed tea; the finer the 
quality of the tea, the less quantity need be employed. 

Never add fresh tea to that which has already been made, 
by way of strengthening it ; for it will not have that effect ; 
but in case of its being too weak, then put the additional tea 
into a large teacup, fill it up with boiling water, and leave it 
there, closely covered, for a few minutes, after which throu" 
the contents into the teapot. 

The foregoing instructions are in accordance with our 
mothers^ and grandmothers notions of " making tea well ;" but 
latterly it has been asserted that a very pernicious quality in 
tea is extracted from the water standing long upon it. A 
physician asserts that " tea-drinkers, in following this plan, 
put more fees into the physician's pocket than by any other he 
knows." He recommends that 2 teapots should always be 
used, eacli of sufficient size to hold the quantity required ; 
that the whole of the water shall be poured on the tea at once, 
and not allowed to stand upon it more than three or 4 minutes, 
when it should be poured into the other teapot, and served from 



570 MODERX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXIX. 

that. If the party is large, this process must be repeated. By 
this means all the tea will be of equal strength, and you get 
the fine aromatic flavour without the injurious matter. We 
have for some time made tea in this way, and very much 
approve it. It certainly approaches nearer to the method 
adopted amongst the Chinese, who have water poured upon 
the tea in the teacup, and in some parts of India the tea is 
enclosed in a perforated silver egg, which is put into the pot, 
and taken out when the infusion is sulficiently strong. 



CHOCOLATE, 

819. — If made thin, is not worth drinking ; and that which 
is now commonly sold by the grocers is a compound of flour, 
or some farinaceous substance, and coarse sugar or treacle, 
together with a very moderate quantity of real cocoa, and that 
of the most inferior quality, coloured with Venetian red and 
brown ochre. If you mean to have really good chocolate, you 
must, therefore, pay a far higher price than is paid for the 
trash to which we have alluded. That made in Florence has 
long been celebrated, and there has been for many years a 
large manufactory established near Paris by one Menier, 
which has a very high reputation there ; having tried it, we 
can also recommend it, and it can be had in London, either of 
Messrs. Dakin and Co., St. Paul's Churchyard; pr Hedges 
and Butler, 155, Regent Street. 

Chocolate forms the common breakfast througliout Spain, 
and is there made by merely chipping a portion of the cake 
into which it is formed from the cocoa, leaving the chips in 
'water for a whole night to soften. It may then be slowly 
warmed, along with either water or milk, working it all the 
time with the mill, Avhich is a small moveable pole parsed 
through the lid of a chocolate-pot, and furnished with a head- 
piece in order to mix the chocolate equally by turning the mill 
rapidly between the hands and without in tei mission, thus to 
prevent it from becoming clotty ; care, however, should be 
taken not to let it hail; for, in that case, the vegetable oil 
which is contained in the nut will be extracted from it and 
appear on the surface. The flavour is better retained by 
making it in water than milk. 

It is always made very thick, so that a small spoon will 



Chap. XXX. ENGLISH WINES. 571 

nearly stand upright in it, and nothing eaten with it but a 
rusk, or dry toast : alter which there is usually taken a draught 
of cold spring water. 

The usual mode of making it is to boil a pint of water in the 
pot, put to it a cake of chocolate cut into very small slices, 
mill it off the fire till quite melted, tlien put it on a gentle fire 
till it nearly boils, milling it all the time. Pour it into a basin, 
and it will keep in a cool place for several days. When used 
put a couple of tablespoonf uls of it into milk, warm it with 
sugar, and mill it well. 

COCOA, 

820. — An excellent breakfast beverage may be made by 
simply pounding the nut — which is the substance of choco- 
late — and boiling it in the same manner in either water or 
milk. The best quality is that of Caraccas^ which is small, 
very dark-coloured, and appaars as if partly mouldy or broken ; 
while that usually to be found in tlie shops is plump and 
glossy, and the patent sort, or paste, still more inferior; it 
being always made from the cheapest kind, and not unfre- 
quently from that which has been damaged. 

Cocoa Shells or Nibs, or, as they are more appropriately 
called in Ireland, " Miserable," are tlie thin coverings of the 
cocoa kernel, and can only be had at some chocolate manu- 
factory, where they can be bought at a very low price, and 
form a light food for an invalid, when taken warm. 

Soak them in water during the whole night, and then boil 
them in the same water mi til reduf^-d to ^ the quantity : they 
should boil 2 hours, and should then be mixed up with milk. 



CHAPTER XXX. 
ON ENGLISH WINES AND LIQUEURS. 

ENGLISH WINES. 

821. — ENGI.ISH wines maybe made very advantageously by 
families who have gardens, as, from the reduced price of sugar, 
they cost but little comparatively with foreign wines, all of 
which pay heavy duties. They should, however, be thoroughly 
fermented, and be made of such strength as to keep sound for 3 



572 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. ClIA^. XXX. 

or 4 years, and never be drunk until they are mor^ than a year 
old ; whereas those housewives wlio look too closely to economy 
^veaken them so much with water as to cause tliem soon t(» 
turn sour. In the south of Europe the grape contains all the 
chemical properties which enable it to undergo complete fer- 
mentation, and from which perfect wine can be produced ; but 
the artificial composition of the fluids on which the maker of 
domestic wine in England has to operate makes it advisable 
that a few words should be said upon the subject. The sub- 
stances essential to vinous fermentation are sugar, vegetable 
extract, the tartaric or malic acids, and water. None of these 
can be dispensed with, and it is in the balancing of them 
that the art greatly consists. Sugar is the most essential of 
these, as it is from its decomposition that alcohol is derived. 
The most saccharine juices therefore may be made to produce 
the strongest wine : hence the absolute necessity of adding 
sugar to all English fruit, in which the malic acid so largely 
predominates ; and it is from the judiciov.s mixture of sugar and 
v/ater with this acid that our best native wines are produced, 
as by this only will the process of fermentation be effectually 
carried on. Any one attempting to make wine from the juice 
of currants or gooseberries, or even ripe grapes, alone, would 
at once perceive this. The use of brandy is quite unnecessary 
if the wine is properly fermented, and it keeps sound much 
better without it. Yeast, also, should never be used in wine 
made of fresh fruit, as, if the proportions are properly ad- 
justed, the fluid will ferment of itself. The four following 
receipts we have used and approved for many years, the 
first of which may be taken as a guide in almost all sorts of 
domestic wine made of fresh fruit — the quantities of course 
varying with the quality of the fruit. If due attention be paid, 
it may almost be said " never to fail." The fermentation 
requires the greatest care, as on it so much depends. If 
checked too soon, the wine is imperfect, and not so wholesome. 
If carried on too far, the acetous stage commences. It is 
therefore necessary to watch it with great attention. The 
process commences within 24 hours of the mixture being 
made, which is perceived by a slight hissing noise and little 
bubbles rising on the surface. This will increase when put 
into the cask, when it will be so loud that it may be heard at 
some distance, and will continue some weeks. Unless the 
ivine is intended to be sweet, it should not be closed up till the 



CiiAP. XXX. ENGLISH \VIXES. 573" 

hissing has very much subsided. If it is intended to be dry, 
and represent foreign wine, it should be drawn oft" into a barrel 
which has been sulphured. To have it sparkling-, tJie scum 
which rises in fermenting should be allowed to sink, instead of 
running oul, and the barrel bunged up whilst the wine still 
retains a slig^ht tendency to ferment. All wine is improved by 
being racked off", and a little isinglass added — about ^^oz. to 10 
gallons. This should be done 2 or 3 months before bottling, 
and not in very hot or very cold weather. 

WINE FR03I UNRIPE GRAPES. 

822. — As the stems and husks of grapes give no bad flavour 
to the fruit, it may be used in any stage of ripening, or dif- 
ferent degrees may be mixed together. The fruit is in the 
best state when just beginning to ripen. For every gallon 
take '5 lbs. of fruit; have a tub which will hold 15 or 20 
gallons ; bruise the grapes into this so thoroughly that if pos- 
sible every berry shall be mashed; when the whole are in, 
stalks and all, add 4 gallons of cold spring water; mix all 
well with the hand till the juice and pulp are separated from 
the more solid matter; cover the tub, and let it stand 24 
hours ; strain it through a coarse bag, and squeeze the fruit 
quite dry ; pour a gallon of water over the solid mass, to get 
any soluble matter which may remain. Put into a tub or 
cooler 30 lbs. of loaf-sugar ; pour the fluid upon it, first mea- 
suring it ; make up with water to the total bulk of 10^ gal- 
lons ; mix this until the sugar is dissolved. This is called the 
must, and is equivalent to the juice of the grape. Co\'er up 
the vessel with a board, over which throw a blanket, and let it 
stand in a moderate temperature for 24 hours or more, ac- 
cording as it may appear to begin to ferment. Put it into the 
cask, which should be kept full to the bung-hole, and a little 
inclined to one side to let the scum w^ork oft": you have ^ gal- 
Jon of must for this purpose. There should be a hole near the 
bung which should be stopped wdth a wooden peg, and when 
the bung is closed up tlu; peg should in a day or two be loosened, 
that the fixed air may have vent : this should be repeated at 
intervals till the excessive expansion has ceased, when the peg 
may be driven tight. The best way to keep the bung air-tight 
is to paste a double piece of brown paper over it. Let the wine 
remain in a cool cellar till a clear warm day in January, then 
rack it off", and let it stand to the end of March before bottling. 



574 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX. 

It will keep for many years. We have some m our cellar 
made 22 years ago, which is very fine indeed, and perfectly 
sound. If it is a brisk or champagne wine, it will be very 
good the following summer. When racked and clarified, the 
isinglass should be dissolv^ in a little of the wine, and well 
mixed in the barrel. 

Green Gooseberry Wine may be made in exactly the same 
way. 

ORANGE WINE. 

823. — For 10 gallons take 100 Seville oranges ; peel them 
very thin ; press out the juice, and put it, with 30 lbs. of loaf- 
sugar, into a cask ; put the peel into a deep pan, large enough 
to allow a gallon of cold water to be poured over it ; let this 
stand till the next day, then pour the water over the sugar and 
juice already in the cask ; cover the peel again with water, 
adding it to the cask the next day, and continue to do so imtil 
the cask is full. Stir it well every day for 2 or 3 weeks, by 
which time it will be in full fermentation, which will continue 
for nearly a couple of months ; after which draw it off, and after 
taking out the lees, and cleaning out the cask with a dry cloth, 
dissolve ^ oz. of isinglass in a little of the "wine, stir it well in, 
and bung it up close till the autumn, March being the proper 
month to make this wine in. It will be found very convenient 
to have a second cask to rack wine into, which is at once put 
under the tap, and avoids all splashing and waste. Where the 
custom is to use casks of the same size, one or two extra ones 
only are required. 

PARSNIP rf'-INE. 

824. — To every gallon of water take 3 lbs. of fine clear 
parsnips and the same weight of loaf-sugar ; slice the parsnips 
into the water, and let them boil to a pulp ; strain them 
through a hair sieve, return the liquor into the boiler, and add 
the sugar ; let it boil ^ an hour ; when tepid, lay a toast 
covered with yeast in it, and cover it, keeping the cooler in a 
warm place ; when it begins to ferment, put it into the cask, 
taking out the toast. It should not be racked till the autumn, 
and not bottled in less than a year. Parsnips are best in the 
winter. All warm fluids to be fermented should be regulated 
by a thermometer. Tepid is from 85 to 95 degrees. The cold 
'jf the weather should regulate the heat between this range. 



CiiAP. XXX. ENGLISH WINES. 575 

GINGER WINE. 

825. — To every gallon of water take 2 lbs. of loaf-sugar and 
2 oz. of bruised g-inger ; boil them together for an hour ; put 
the liquor into a vessel to cool ; when tepid, add the juice and 
peel of 6 lemons, and a toast covered with yeast ; cover it 
over, and when it begins to ferment put it into the cask ; let it 
ferment 2 or 3 weeks. Before putting in the bung, put to it 
-J lb. of raisins to every gallon ; they need not be stoned, but 
are best just slit open. This wine may be racked in another 
month, and isinglass put to clarify it. Bottle it in 3 or 4 
weeks, and it is soon fit to drink, though, if properly fermented, 
it will keep a year or two and improve. 

Amongst the following receipts are many which have long 
heQTi family favourites ; but as they generally recommend the 
old-fashioned plan of adding spirits to the wine, in the place of 
trusting to the process of fermentation for its strength, we 
cannot ourselves quite approve them ; nevertheless there are 
some from which most excellent wine has been made. 

A RICH AND PLEASANT WINE. 

826. — Take neio cider from the press, mix it with as much 
honey as will support an eg^, boil gently 15 minutes, but not 
in an iron, brass, or copper pot ; skim it well ; when cool, let 
it be tunned, but do not quite fill the cask. In March follow- 
ing bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 weeks, but will be 
less sweet if kept longer in the cask. You will have a rich 
and strong wine, and it keeps well. This will serve for any 
culinary purposes which sack or sweet wine is directed for. 

Honey is a fine ingredient to assist, and render palatable, 
new crabbed austere cider; but this should be made from 
apples that are perfectly sound and of good quality. 

ENGLISH MALMSEY OR MALT WINE.—E.R. 

827. — Take 30 gallons of sweet- wort, and to every gallon 
put li lb. of lump sugar ; boil the liquor for i an hour, and 
when still warm tun it into a barrel, putting 2 lbs. of Malaga 
raisins coarsely chopped, 2 oz. of dissolved isinglass, and 1 
spoonful of yeast to each gallon, adding also 3 oz. of hops for 
the 30 gallons ; stir the liquor with a wooden staff every day 
for a fortnight or longer ; keep the bung lightly in until the 
iiermentation ceases, then add 2 gallons of brandy : let tlie wine 



576 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX. 

stand 12 months, when it may be racked off and bottled. It 
will be the better for long- keeping, and will answer well for 
all culinary purposes. 

Or : — Take 3 J gallons of new ale from the vat whilst fer- 
menting, 5^ gallons of cold spring water ; to every gallon add 
3 lbs. of sugar ; mix all well together till the sugar is dis- 
solved ; put it at once into the cask, and set it in a warm place 
to ferment, wlfich it ought to do for 6 or 7 weeks ; chop 2 lbs. 
of Malaga raisins and ^ lb. of bitter almonds together ; put 
them into a wide-mouthed bottle, and add a pint of brandy ; 
cork it up till the wine has done fermenting, then put it into 
the cask, and bung it down close ; let it stand 6 or 7 months, 
clear it off into another cask, adding ^ oz. of isinglass dissolved 
in a little of the wine ; let it stand another month, then bottle 
it. This has been proved to be an excellent receipt. 

GRAPE WINE,—E.R. 

828. — Take 20 lbs. of grapes very ripe and picked clean, 
pour upon them 6 quarts of boiling water, cover them close, 
and before they are cold break the grapes with the hand ; let 
them stand 3 days, then strain them as dry as possible, and stir 
into the liquor 10 lbs. of sugar ; tun it the next day, and it 
will work itself pure ; lay the bung on it until it has done 
hissing. 

RAISIN WINE.—E.R. 

829. — To every 6 gallons of water put 2 oz. of hops and the 
largest stalks of the Malaga raisins, and boil it for \ of an 
hour ; strain it, and when nearly cold pour it on the fruit, 
allowing 6^ lbs., of which one-fifth should be Smyrna raisins, 
to every gallon of water ; let it stand for 6 weeks, stirring it 
every day ; press the fruit, and then put the liquor into the 
cask ; rack it in 6 weeks, or as soon as it is fine, and to every 
6 gallons add a bottle of the best French brandy. 

Excellent Raisin Wine. — To every gallon of spring water 

put 8 lbs. of fresh Smyrnas in a large tub ; stir it thoroughly 

every day for a month ; then press the raisins in a horse-hair 

bag as dry as possible ; put the liquor into a cask, and, when 

it has done hissing, pour in a bottle of the best brandy ; stop if 

close for 12 months ; then rack it off, but without the dregs ; 

filter them through a bao^ of flannel of 3 or 4 folds ; add the 

All 
t.lear to the quantity, and pour 1 or 2 quarts of brandy, 



CsAr. XXX. ENGLISH WINES. 577 

according- to the size of the vessel. Stop it up, and at the end 
of 3 years you may either bottle it or drink it from the cask. 

Kaisin wine would be extremely good if made rich of the 
fruit, and kept long-, which improves the flavour greatly. 

Maishi Wi?ie with Cider. — Put 2 cvvt. of Malaga raisins 
into a cask, and pour upon them a hogshead of good sound 
cider that is not rough ; stir it well 2 or 3 days ; stop it, and 
let it stand 6 months ; then rack into a cask that it will fill, 
and put in a gallon of the best brandy. 

If raisin wine be much used, it would answer well to keep a 
cask always for it, and bottle off 1 year's wine just in time to 
make the rest, which, allowing the 6 months of infusion, would 
make the wine to be 18 months old. In cider counties this 
way is very economical ; and, even if not thought strong enough, 
the addition of another J cwt. of raisins would be sufnciei:t, and 
the wine would still be* very cheap. 

When the raisins are pressed through a horsehair bag, they 
will either produce a good spirit by distillation (for which 
purpose they must be very little pressed) ; or they will make 
excellent vinegar. 

The stalks, being very acia, should be picked out, and may 
be thrown into any cask of vinegar that is being made. 

CURRANT WINE.—E.R. 

830. — To each gallon of juice put 2 of water and 3^ lbs. of 
moist sugar. When it has l3een in the cask about a fortnight, 
put a bottle of brandy to every 4 gallons of wine, and, when 
it has quite done hissing, bung it down close. 

Or: — 'To every 3 pints of fruit, carefully cleared from 
any that is mouldy or bad, put 1 quart of water ; bruise the 
former. In 24 hours strain the liquor, and put to every quart 
1 lb. of sugar, of good middling quality of Lisbon. If for 
white currants use lump-sugar. It is best to put the fruit, &c., 
in a large pan ; and when in 3 or 4 days the scum rises, take 
that off before the liquor is put into the barrel. 

Those who make from their own gardens may not have 
sufficient to fill the barrel at once : the wine will not be hurt 
if made in the pan in the above proportions, and added as tlio 
fruit ripens, and can be gathered in dry weather. Keep an 
accoimt of w hat is put in each time. 

Another way. — Put 5 quarts of currants and a pint of rasp- 
berries to every 2 gallons of water; let them soak a niirlit ,

tlieii squeeze and break them well. Next day rub them well 
on a fine \vire sieve till all the juice is obtained, washing the 
skins again with some of the water ; then to every gallon put 
4 lbs. of very good Lisbon sugar, but not white, which is often 
adulterated ; tun it immediately, and lay the bung lightly on ; 
do not use anything to work it. In 2 or 3 days put a bottle 
of brandy to every 4 gallons ; bung it close, but leave the peg 
out at top a few days ; keep it 3 or 4 years, and it will be a 
very fine agreeable wine. 

BLACK CURRANT WINE (venj fine). 

831. — To every 3 quarts of juice put the same of water un- 
boiled, and to every 3 quarts of the liquor add 3 lbs. of very 
pure moist sugar; put it into a cask, reserving a little for 
filling up ; put the cask in a warm dry room, and the liquor 
will ferment of itself; skim off the refuse when the fermenta- 
tion shall he over, and fill up with the reserved liquor ; when 
it has ceased working, pour 3 quarts of brandy to 40 quarts of 
wine ; bung it close for 9 months, then bottle it, and drain 
the tliick part tlirough a jelly-bag until it be clear, and bottle 
that ; keep it 10 or 12 months. This recipe is most excellent. 
The wine will keep for 6 years. 

Or : — Bruise 28 lbs. of currants, and pour upon them 2 
gallons of water ; let them remain 24 hours, then strain off 
the liquor, adding 14 lbs. of .pure moist or loaf sugar; put 
the whole into a clean cask. In the follomng spring rack 
the liquor, and run the grounds through a jelly-bag; then put 
it into a clean cask, and add a bottle of brandy. The above 
proportions will make 5 gallons of wine. 

GOOSEBERRY WINE. 

832. — To ever}'' 3 lbs. of gooseberries put a pint of spring 
water unboiled, having first bruised the fruit with the hands 
in a tub ; stir them very well ; let them stand a whole day, 
then strain them off, and to every 3 lbs. of gooseberries add a 
pint of water and 1 lb. of sugar dissolved ; let it stand 24 
hours longer, then skim the head clean off, and put the liquor 
into a vessel, and the scum into a flannel bag, adding the 
liquor that drains from it to that in the vessel ; let it work 2 
or 3 days before stopping it up close, and allow it to stand 4 
months before it is bottled. When it is drawn out of the caijk 
it should not be tapped too low. 



Chap. XXX. ENGLISH WINES. 579 

Green Gooseberry Wine. — Take 3S quarts of unripe goose- 
berries of the green kind, bruise them well, add 32 quarts of cold 
water; let them stand for 24 hours; drain the gooseberries 
well from the liquor through a sieve ; put 3t lbs. of lump- 
sugar to every gallon of liquor ; put it into a cask with a bottle 
of the best gin ; let it stand 6 months, and then bottle it. 

This is a receipt from a nobleman's butler, who used to 
boast that he never opened more than one bottle of Cham- 
pagne at his master's table at one dinner, all that followed 
being of his own manufacture. 

CHAMPAGNE.— E. R. 
833. — Bruise well the amber hairy Champagne gooseberries, 
when they are just turning, in an equal quantity of cold spring 
water. Let the mixture stand for 2 or 3 days to ferment, and 
stir it frequently with a wooden spoon, taking care to place 
the vessel in a warm situation. Then pass the liquor through 
a hair sieve, squeezing the pulp until it is quite dry. For 
every gallon of the liquor put 3-j lbs. of the coarsest East 
India sugar, which nmst be placed in another vessel, and the 
acid liquor poured upon it. Allow it to stand 2 or 3 days, in 
order that the fermentation may be properly effected, stirring 
it very frequently : then pass it through a flannel bag into the 
cask, and to every 10 gallons of the liquor put 1 oz. of isin- 
glass, 1 bottle of Madeira wine, and 1 bottle of rum ; the 
2 latter added after the cask has remained open for a month. 
A cask which has held brandy is to be preferred. Put in 
tlie bung after tlie expiration of the month ; lay a piece of 
coarse cloth over it, and cover the Avhole with a thick coat of 
resin. Let it stand 12 months, and then bottle it.*" 

Pink Champagne. — Boil 9 lbs. of lump-sugar in 3 gallons 
of water for i an hour, skim it well, and pour the liquor boil- 
ing hot over a gallon of red and white currants picked, but 
not bruised. When nearly cold, put in a small teacupful of 
yeast. Keep it working for 2 days, then strain it through a 
horse-hair sieve, put it into a small cask with ^ oz. of isinglass. 

* A sample of this wine was sent to the Horticultural Society of Edin- 
burgh, and exhibited amongst 70 different sorts, and, being pronounced the 
best, the honour of the gold medal was awarded to it ; but on its being un- 
derstood that the fruit was of English growth, it was considered as a foreign 
wine, and therefore not entitled to the prize. Honourable meutiou of it wan, 
however, made in the Report of the Transac :ons of the Society.

580 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKEEY. Chap. XXX. 

Ha^ve rather more liquor tlian will fill the cask to fill it up as 
it works over. In about a fortnight bung ^t up. Let it stand 
till April ; put into each bottle a lump of double-refined 
sugar. Let the bottles remain '1 day uncorked. Cork and 
wire them. They must stand upright in the cellar ; when 
v.antedj put a few on their sides for about a week. 

Grape Champagne to equal foreign. — Gather the grapes 
when they are just turning, or aijout half ripe. Pound them 
in a tub; and to every quart of fruit put 2 quarts of water. 
Let it stand in a mash-tub for 14 days, then draw it oif, and 
lo every gallon of liquor add 3 lbs. of lump-sugar. When 
the sugar is dissolved, cask it, and, after it has done working-, 
bung it down. In about 6 months it will be fi-t to drink, 
when it should be bottled, and the corks tied down, or wired 
if it is to be kept more than a year. 

LE3I0N WINE. 

834. — To every gallon of water take 3 lbs. of sugar ; boil 
it -.J an hour ; pour it on the peel of 4 lemons ; make the 
juice into a syrup by boiling it v.dth ^ lb. of the sugar ; mix 
all well together ; when cool lay on it a toast covered with 
yeast ; let it stand 2 days, when the fermentation v/ill have 
commenced ; put it into the barrel, keep it filled up to the 
top till the fermentation subsides ; bung it down close and 
bottle it in 3 months. 

FRONTINIAC.—E. R. 

835. — Boil 18 lbs. of white sugar in 6 gallons of water with 
2 whites of eggs well beaten. Skim it ancT put in J peck of 
elder-flowers : do not kecD them on the fire : when nearlv 
cold, stir it, and add 6 spoonfuls of lemon-juice and 4 or .5 of 
yeast ; beat the whole well into the liquor. Stir it every day, 
put 6 lbs. of the best raisins, stoned, into the cask, and tun 
the wine. Stop it close, and bottle it at the end of 6 months. 
This wine requires keeping. 

ELDER WINE.—E.R. 
836. — Pour 4 quarts of water upon 8 quarts of berries, and 
let it stand a day or two ; then boil it for about an hour, strain 
it, and put 3 lbs. of moist sugar to every gallon of wine ; then 
add 1 oz. of cloves and cinnamon, with 2 oz. of ginger ; boil 
it again, and work it with a toast dipped in yeast. 



CiiAP. XXX. ENGLISH WINES. 583 

bottle it ill stone bottles, tie down the corks, and it will be fit 
to drink in 2 days. 

EGp WINE. 

842. — Beat an e^^, and mix with it a spoonful of cold 
water; set on the fire a glass of white wine, ^ a glass of 
water, a little sugar, and nutmeg. When it boils, pour it to 
the e^^ by degrees, stirring it well : then return the whok^ 
into the saucepan, put it on a gentle fire, stir it one way for 
not more than a minute ; for if it boil, or the e^^ be stale, it 
will curdle. Serve with dry toast. 

Egg vrine may be made as above, without warmirig liio 
G%'^, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not so 
pleasant to the taste. 

Or : — It may be done without any other preparation than 
merely breaking the yoik of a raw egg or two into a tumbler 
of hot negus or spirit and water, mixing it all the while : if 
the whites be added, they will occasion froth, but not improve 
the flavour. 

TO MULL WINE, 

843. — Boil a bit of cinnamon, a few cloves and allspice, and 
some grated nutmeg a few minutes in a large teacupful of 
water : then put to it a pint of port wine, and add sugar to your 
taste ; beat it up, and it will be ready. 

It may also be made of good British or foreign red wine ; 
and is much used throughout the north of Germany under the 
naDAe of " Bischopf," 

NEGUS.— E.R. 

844. — 1 bottle of wine, i lb. of sugar, and a lemon sliced. 
Pour 3 pints of boiling -water upon this mixture, and grate 
nutmeg to the taste. 

Such is the common mode of making: neg^us ; for makinof a 
single tumblerful, however, as many people prefer to do it in 
their own way, perhaps a better plan is to use only half the 
quantity of water, poured hoil'mg hot upon the wine already 
sweetened and flavoured with nutmeg ; but having in it also 
a large and very thin cut rind of Seville orange, which gives 
it a very superior flavour, without any portion of the acid. 

Tlie negus may be made of either white or red wine ; and, 
if drunk cold, is called " sangaree." 

The following is a Freyich. receipt : — 1 lb. of cherries, 4 lbs 
r,f currants, 2 lbs. of black cherries; squeeze all together, 



584 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX. 

then let it stand in a cool cellar for 3 days ; put the juice 
on tlie lire in a preserving-pan^ and allow it to bubble ; add 
sugar £is for raspberry vinegar, and bottle it. This makes a 
delicious summer beverage. 



LIQUEURS. 
a:^ excellent method for making punch. 

84 Q. — Take 2 large fresh lemons with rough skins q?iite 
ripe, and some large lumps of double-refined sugar. Rub the 
sug'ar over the lemons till it has absorbed all the yellow parts 
of the skins. Then put into the bowl these lumps, and. as 
nmch more as the juice of the lemons may be supposed to 
require ; for no certain weight can be mentioned, as the acidity 
of a lemon cannot be known till tried, and therefore this must 
be determined by the taste. Then squeeze the lemon -juice 
upon th.e sugar, and vv'ith a bruiser press the sugar and the 
juice particularly well together, for a great deal of the rich- 
ness and fine flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing 
and mixing process being thoroughly performed. Then mix 
this up very iv ell with boiling water (soft water is best), till 
the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which is 
called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy and rum in 
eqiial quantities, and put them to it, mixing the whole well 
together again. The quantity of liquor must be according to 
your taste : 2 good lemons are generally enough to make 4 
quarts of punch, including a quart of liquor, with -J lb. of 
sugar : but this depends much on taste and on the strength of 
the spirit. 

As the pulp is disagreeable to some persons, the sherbet may 
be strained before the spirit is put in. Some strain the lemon 
])efore they put it to the sugar, which is improper ; as when 
the pulp and sugar are well mixed together it adjds much to 
the richness of tlie punch. 

When only rum is used, about -J pint of porter will soften 
the punch : and even when both rum and brandy are used, tlie 
porter gives a richness, and to some a very pleasant flavour. 

This receipt has never been in print before, but is greatly 
admired. It is impossible to take too much pains in all the 
processes c f mixing, and in minding to do them extre^'^d^, 



0;:Ar. XXX. LIQUEUES. 58o 

icell, that all the different articles may be most thoroug-hly in- 
corporated together. 

Another : — Divide the intended quantity of liquid into 4 
2)ortions ; 3 of water, and 1 of spirits. Take enough of syrup 
or pounded white sugar and lemon-jidce, according to taste, 
and add as much thinly-pared Seville orange-peel as will give 
it fiavour. Mix them up with 3 parts of old Jamaica rum, 
and 1 of real French brandy : then boil the water with a 
small quantity of green tea, so as to make a weak infusion, 
and pour it boiling hot, through a muslin strainer, upon the 
mixture. Let it be made in a deep jug, with a cover to keep 
it hot, and if you have a little arrack it will make the punch 
better in flavour ; while a small quantity of confectioners' 
calf 's-foot jelly will improve its richness. 

George the Fourth^ s Punch. — 1 bottle of champagne ; 1 
pint of white brandy ; 2 tablespoonfuls of rum ; 2 ditto of 
arrack ; 1 large glass of maraschino ; ^ pint of pine-apple 
syrup ; ^ pint of clarified sugar ; 1 pint of green tea ; the 
peel of 2 Seville oranges and of 1 lemon ; squeeze the juice, 
mix it with the other ingredients, and strain it through a lawn 
sieve. 

Tea Punch, a la Chevret. — t pint of rum, the same quan- 
tity of brandy, the juice of a lemon, and sugar at discretion, 
added to a quart of strong tea. Set fire to it, and when it 
has burned out, drink it while quite hot. 

Colonel Hawker's Cold Punch. — A wineglass nearly full 
of the best refined sugar pounded ; 1 2 ditto of cold spring 
water ; half a wineglassful of lemon-juice ; 2 wineglasses 
hrimfull of old Jamaica rum. Let the sugar be well melted 
and the lemon-juice thoroughly amalgamated with it and the 
water before adding the rum. 

Verder, or Milk Punch. — Pare 6 oranges and 6 lemons 
as thin as you can, grate them with sugar to get the flavour. 
Steep the peels in a bottle of rum or brandy stopped close 
24 hours. Squeeze the fruit on 2 lbs. of sugar, add to it 4 
quarts of water, and 1 of new milk boiling-hot ; stir the rum 
into the above, and run it through a jelly-bag till perfectly 
clear. Bottle, and cork close immediately. 

Or : — Take the rinds of 30 lemons pared very thin, steep 
them for 3 days in 2 quarts of rum ; then pour them into a 

"^ c3 



586 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX. 

vessel, adding' 3 quarts more of rum, 3 quarts of water, 1 of 
lemon-juice, 4 lbs. of loaf-sugar, and 2 nutmegs grated. Dis- 
solve the sugar in the water ; mix all together, and then pour 
upon the ingredients 2 quarts of milk boiling hot. Stir it 
well together, and let it stand 2 hours ; then strain it through 
a jelly-bag till perfectly clear, much depending upon clearing 
it well. 

Norfolk Punch. — In 20 quarts of French brandy put the 
peels of 30 lemons and 30 oranges, pared so thin that not the 
least of the white is taken. Infuse 12 hours. Have ready 30 
quarts of cold water that has boiled; put to it 15 lbs. of 
double-refined sugar ; and, when well mixed, pour it upon 
the brandy and peels, adding the juice of the oranges and of 
24 lemons ; mix well ; then strain through a very fine hair 
sieve into a very clean barrel that has held spirits, and put 
2 quarts of new milk. Stir, and then bung it close ; let it 
stand 6 weeks in a warm cellar : bottle the liquor for use, 
observing great care that the bottles are perfectly clean and 
dry, and the corks of the best quality and well put in. Ihis 
liquor will keep many years, and is improved by age. 

Or : — Pare 6 lemons and 3 Seville oranges very thin, 
squeeze the juice into a large jar, and put to it 2 quarts of 
brandy, 1 of white wine, 1 of milk, and li lb. of sugar. 
Let it be mixed, and then covered for 24 hours : strain through 
a jelly-bag till clear, then bottle it. 

Orange Punch. — Dissolve nearl}^ f lb. of sugar in a little 
water, add the juice of 2 lemons, and pour 2 quarts of boiling 
water upon it for the slierbet ; then add a glass of calfs-foot 
jelly. Mix together a bottle of brandy, a bottle of rum, and 
1 of orange-wine, add it to the sherbet, and drink it either 
hot or cold. If bottled and placed in a cold cellar, it will 
keep for anj'' time. The orange wine imparts a very fine 
flavour, which may be heightened by the addition of a bottle 
*"»f liqueur, cura9oa, or maraschino. 

Regent^ s Punch. — Make the sherbet with green tea, capil- 
laire, and lemon-juice ; to 5 pints of this mixture add 1 pint 
of rum, 1 of brandy, 1 of arrack, and a bottle of cura9oa, 
together with a small jar or shape of Guava jelly. Pour in a 
bottle of champagne, and send up the punch in a bowl or jug, 
with a pine-apple sliced into it. 

An excellent liqueur. — Stick 6 cloves into a fine ripe Cliina

orange, put it into a glass jar, adding ^ lb. of the finest moist 
sugar. Pour over it a quart of good brandy, tie a bladder 
over the jar, and over that a pasted paper. Set it in the sun, 
or in a warm place, for 3 or 4 weeks, shaking it gently every 
day till the sugar is thoroughly dissolved ; strain it off and 
bottle it. This is a very fine stomachic. 

SHRUB.— JS. R. 

846. — Of Rum. — Take equal proportions of Seville orange- 
juice, the best Jamaica rum, and suoar, with about a pint of 
the orange-seeds bruised, first removing the outer husk. No 
water must be added to these materials. 

Of Brandy. — Put 2 quarts of brandy in a large bottle with 
the juice of 5 lemons and the peels of 2 ; stop it up, and let it 
stand 3 days, then add 3 pints of white wine, 1-^ lb. of loaf- 
sugar, and h a nutmeg : strain it through a flannel bag, and it 
will be found excellent. 

Of White Currant. — Strip the fruit, and prepare it in a jar 
as for jelly ; strain the juice, of which put 2 quarts to 1 gallon 
of rum, and 2 lbs. of lump-sugar ; strain through a jelly-bag. 

Or : — To a gallon of rum put 2 quarts of white currant- 
juice strained, and 1^ lb. of lump-sugar; stir them well toge- 
ther, and let them stand in a pan closely covered all night. 
Slir it well in the morning, strain it through a sieve of coarse 
cloth, and then through a jelly-bag. Should it not be clear, 
put it through the jelly-bag a second time, then bottle it for 
use. 

NOYEAU.—E.R. 

847. — The real liqueur under this name is made in the 
island of Martinique, upon a Ibundation oi French brandy, 
with a species of berry grown in the island, and sweetened 
with syrup. It requires age to give it the flavour of the 
berry, and even in the West Indies is far from being cheap. 
The following receipts, however, are good imitations. 

Blanch 3 oz. of bitter and the same quantity of sweet 
almonds, and bruise them in a mortar ; add them, with the 
rind of 2 lemons, to 1 quart of English gin, which must be 
kept in a moderate heat for 3 dayc and nights. Shake the 
bottle 3 or 4 times a-day, then add 14 oz. of loaf-sugar dis- 
solved in i a pint of boiling water, and let it stand 1 day and 
liight longer, shaking the bottle frequently ; then strain it, 



588 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX. 

and filter it afterwards in blotting-paper such as tlie chemists 
use : bottle it, and it will be fit to drink in 6 months, but will 
improve by keeping for a year. 

Or : — To 1 quart of English gin, or what is better of good 
French brandy^ put 3 oz. of bitter almonds, blanched and cut 
into pieces, and the rind of 3 lemons. Let it stand 3 days 
before the fire, shaking tlie bottle 2 or 3 times a-day ; then 
add 1 lb. of good loaf-sugar, or ^ pint of syrup ; let it dis- 
solve, shaking it frequently during the day or two which it 
will take ; then filter it through blotting-paper. 

CHERR Y BRAND Y.—E. R. 

848. — To every pound of cherries put -J lb. of lump-sugar, 
•^ oz. of bitter almonds, and 4 peach-leaves ; pick the cherries 
from the stalks, and put them with the sugar, &c., in bottles, 
filling the bottles Avitli brandy. Put bladder on them, and 
cover that with paper. When Morella cherries are used, after 
3 months the liquor may be poured off, and more brandy 
added. 

RA TAFIA. 

849. — Blanch 2 oz. of peach and apricot kernels, bruise and 
put them into a bottle, and fill nearly up with brandy. Dis- 
solve ^ lb. of white sugar-candy in a cup of cold water, and 
add to the brandy after it has stood a month on the kernels, 
and they are strained off; then filter tlirough paper, and bottle 
for use. The distilled leaves of peaches and nectarines, vrlien 
tlie trees are cut in the spring, are an excellent substitute for 
ratafia in puddings. 

Ratafie des Quatre Fruits. — Take 30 lbs. of cherries, 15 
of gooseberries, 8 of raspberries, and 6 of black currants ; 
stone the cherries, and press the juice out of all the fruit : 
to each pint of juice put 6 oz. of pounded sugar. When it 
has stood long enough to clear, bottle it off, 

BLACK CURRANT LIQUEUR. 
850. — Put black currants into a stone pan, with as much 
leaves as fruit ; cover them all over with spirits of wine for G 
v.eeks, or longer if 3^ou please ; then squeeze the mass through 
linen ; clarify the juice, and add syrup made with lump-sugar 
and water, according to taste ; it must be thrown in very hot. 
This may be made with whatever spirit you like, providing it 
is tasteless. 



CiiAP. XXX. LIQUEURS. 589 

CREMES.—E. n. 
851. — J) a Portugal. — Take 8 good lemons, rough skinned, 
but ^vithout spots ; pare the rind very thinly, and cut it into 
small slips ; put it into a bottle with a pint of spirits of wine, 
and a dozen bitter almonds blanched and bruised. Let it 
stand 6 days ; make a syrup with a pound of treble-refined 
sugar ; add it when cool : shake the whole well together. Let 
it stand 6 days, and then filter it through blotting-paper. 
This liqueur should be kept 6 months. 

De Cacao. — Take 1 lb. of good Caraccas cocoa, roast it as 
if to be used for chocolate, being careful to take out the bad 
grains, of which there are sometimes several, and they would 
spoil the liqueur : pound it well, and infuse it in 6 pints of 
brandy ; add ^ oz. of cut vanilla : let it stand for 8 days, then 
strain it. Melt 3^ lbs. of sugar in 3 pints of water; mix it 
well together, and filter it. 

CURACOA. 

852. — Take ] lb. of the dried peel of the Seville orange, 
wash it in several lukewarm waters, then drain it over a sieve ; 
put it into a jar with 8 pints of brandy and 2 of water ; let it 
stand for a fortnight, shaking it frequently ; strain it. Melt 
5 lbs. of sugar in 3 pints of water, mix it with the liquor and 
strain it. 

SYR UP FOR LIQ UE URS.—E. R. 

853. — Put a quart of water into a saucepan, and let it boil ; 
then drop into it, lump by lump, 1 lb. of loaf-sugar. When 
all the sugar is dissolved, let it boil again and put it into a 
broad dish to cool ; when cool it is fit for use. 

NECTAR.— E. R. 
854. — Take 2 lbs. of raisins chopped, and 4 lbs. of loaf- 
sugar, and put them into a spigot-pot ; pour 2 gallons of boil- 
ing water upon them. The next day, when it is cold, slice 2 
lemons into it. Let it stand 5 days, stirring it twice a-day. 
Then let it stand 5 days more to clear ; bottle it, put it into a 
cold cellar for 10 days, and it will be fit to drink. 

MEAD.—E. R. 
855. — To each gallon of water put 4 lbs. of honey; boil it 
1 hour ; when the scum has done rising pour the liquor into 
a tub, and when cool put a toast with yeast spread over it into 



590 MODEIIN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXXI. 

the tub ; allow it to stand until the next day ; then pour it 
into the cask and put the bung lightly over it ; let it stand 1 
year in the barrel. 

Or : — To every gallon of water put 4 lbs. of honey, and 
boil it f of an hour, taking care to skim it. To every gallon 
add 1 oz. of hops ; then boil it i an hour, and let it stand till 
next day ; put it into the cask, and to 13 gallons of the liquor 
add a quart of brandy. Let it be lightly stopped till the fer- 
mentation is over, and then stop it very close. If you make a 
large cask, keep it a year in cask. 

GINGER CORDIAL. 

856 — Take 1^ oz. of ground ginger, 2 lbs. of white cur- 
rants picked ai.d bruised, cover it close, and let it stand 24 
hours ; pour upon these 1 quart of pure whisky or brandy, 
strain it through a linen cloth, add 1 lb. of loaf-sugar, and 
bottle it. 

Esseiice of Ginger. — Take 3 oz. of ground ginger, 2 oz. of 
lemon-peel cut very thin, put these into a quart of brandy ; 
let it stand a fortnight, shaking it once or twice every day ; 
strain it through a linen cloth, and bottle it. 



CHAPTER XXXI. 

COOKEEY FOR THE SICK. 

It may be necessary to premise that a choice should be made 
of those things most likely to agree with the patient, and, as 
invalids require variety to indulge their appetite, frequent 
changes should be provided, but great simplicity observed 
in the preparation. Perhaps jellies and meat broths, together 
with various kinds of farinaceous food, are the lightest on 
the stomach, as v/ell as, generally speaking, the most nutritious. 

A really goud cook for the sick is rarely met with ; and many 
who possess all the goods of fortune have attributed the first 
return of health to an appetite excited by what is called good 
kitchen physic. 

There is not a better occasion for charitable commiseration 
than when a person is sick. A bit of meat or pudding sent 



Chap. XXXI. COOKEKY FOR THE SICK. 591 

anexpectedly lias often been the means of recalling long-lost 

appetite. 

JELLIES. 

857. — A good Jelly. — Soak 12 shanks of mutton 4 hours, 
then brush and scour them very clean. Lay them in a saucepan 
with 3 blades of mace, an onion, 20 Jamaica and 30 or 40 
black peppers, a bunch of sweet herbs, and a crust of bread 
made very brown by toasting-. Pour 3 quarts of water to 
them, and set them on a hot hearth, close covered ; let them 
simmer as gently as possible for 5 hours, then strain it off, and 
put it in a cold place. 

This may have the addition of a pound of beef, if approved, 
for fiavom'. It is a remarkably good thing for peoj)le who are 
weak. 

Sheep's heads and trotters are also good restoratives; 
savoury jelly may also be made in i\iO, same manner, without 
lemon, wine, or sugar, but flavoured with ham and spice. 

Dr. Ratcliffe^s Pork Jelly. — Take a leg of well-fed pork, 
just as cut up ; beat it, and break the bone. Set it over a 
gentle fire with 3 gallons of water, and simmer to 1. Let 
■J oz. of mace and the same of nutmegs stew in it. Strain 
through a fine sieve. When cold, take off the fat. Give a 
chocolatecupful the first and last thing, and at noon, putting- 
salt to taste. 

Ivory Jelly. — Put ^ lb. of ivory powder into 3 pints of cold 
water, let it simmer until reduced to 1^ pint ; when cold take 
the jelly carefully from the sediment ; add to it the juice of a 
lemon, -J the peel, 2 or 3 cloves, and sugar to taste ; warm it 
till quite dissolved, then strain it. 

Calfs Feet. — Bake 2 calf s feet in 2 pints of water and the 
same quantity of new milk, in a jar, close covered, 3 J hours. 
When cold, remove the fat. 

Give a large teacupful the first and last thing. Whichever 
flavour is approved, give it by baking in it lemon-peel, cinna- 
mon, or mace. Add sugar after^^ ards. 

Sheep's Trotters. — Simmer 6 sheep's trotters, 2 blades of 
mace, a little cinnamon, lemon-peel, a few hartshorn shavings, 
and a little isinglass, in 2 quarts of water, to 1 ; when cold, 
take off" the fat, and give nearly i pint twice a-day, warming 
with it a litde new milk. 

liifiglass. — Boil 1 oz. of isinglass shavings, 40 Jamaica 



532 MODEEN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX"!. 

peppers, and a bit of brown crust of bread, in a quart of 
water, to a pint, and strain it. 

This makes a pleasant jelly to keep in the house ; of whicli 
a larg-e spoonful may be taken in wine and water, milk, tea, 
soup, or any way most agreeable. 

Arrowroot. — It is very necessary to be careful not to get 
the counterfeit sort ; if genuine, it is very nourishing, espe- 
cially for persons with weak bowels. Put into a saucepan ^ a 
pint of water, a glass of sherry, or a spoonful of brandy, grated 
nutmeg, and fine sugar ; boil up once, then mix it by degrees 
into a dessertspoonful of arrowroot, previously rubbed smooth 
with 2 spoonfuls of cold water. 

Or : — Mix a dessertspoonful of arrowroot with a little cold 
water, have ready boiling water in a kettle, pour it upon the 
arrowroot until it becomes quite clear, keeping it stirred all 
the time ; add a little sugar. Where milk may be taken, it is 
very delicious made in the same w^ay with milk instead of water, 
a dessei'tspoonful of arrowroot, and + a pint of milk ; add a 
small bit of lemon-peel. 

Potato. — ^We learn from the ' Gardener's Chronicle' that 
potato-starch is sold at from 1^. to 3^. the lb., though it 
might be prepared at home Avith no other means than a little 
trouble, with a grater and a sieve. 

"To obtain Potato Jell// in perfection, let a potato be 
washed, peeled, and grated ; throw the pulp, thus procured, 
into a jug of water, and stir it well. Pass the mixture of pulp 
and water over a sieve, and collect the Avater which drains 
through into a basin. Let this stand for a few minutes, and a 
suffioJ^ent quantity of starch will have fallen for the purpose 
required. Pour oif the water, and then keep stirring up the 
starch at the bottom of the basin, while boiling water is being 
poured upon it, and it will soon and suddenly pass to the state 
of a jelly. The only nicety required is to be careful that the 
water is absolutely boiling, otherwise the change will not take 
place. It does not require more than 8 minutes to change a 
raw potato into a basinful of most excellent jelly, which has 
only to be seasoned with a little sugar, nutmeg, and white wine, 
to please the most fastidious taste." ^ 

Tapioca. — Choose the largest sort, pour cold water on U 

" G. R. ' Family Pleralcl.' 



Chap. XXXI. COOKERY FOR TPIE SICK. o97 

862. — On an extremely hot plate put 2 or 3 sippets of bread, 
and pour over them some gravy from beef, mutton, or veal, 
with which no butter has been mixed. Sprinkle a little salt over. 

Or : — Take a French roll ; cut it crosswise in slices of about 
•X of an inch thick, and soak them in boiled milk until they have 
imbibed as much as they will take ; then drain them, cover 
them with a coating of egg-batter, and fry them in a cheese- 
toaster. When served, powder them simply with white sugar, 
with or without a slight grating of nutmeg. 

CAUDLE 

863. — Is made in various ways. Make a fine smooth gruel 
of half-grits ; strain it when bailed well ; stir it at difierent 
times till cold. When to be used, add sugar, wine, and lemon- 
peel, with nutmeg. Some like a spoonful of brandy besides 
the wine ; others like lemon-juice. 

Or : — Boil up -J a pint of fine gruel, with a bit of butter the 
size of a large nutmeg, a large spoonful of brandy, the same 
of white wine, 1 of capillaire, a bit of lemon-peel, and nutmeg. 

Ajiother. — Into a pint of fine gruel, not thick, put, while it 
is boiling-hot, the yolk of an G^g beaten with sugar, and mixed 
with a large spoonful of cold water, a glass of wine, and nut- 
meg. Mix by degrees. It is very agreeable and nourishing. 
Some like gruel, with a glass of table-beer, sugar, &c., with 
or without a teaspoonful of brandy. 

Posset. — Boil the grated crumb of a penny loaf in a pint of 
vrater, with the grated peel of a Seville orange, till the mix- 
ture be clear and thick : then add 3 oz. of sweet and 1 oz. of 
bitter almonds, ^ the juice of an orange or any other kind of 
fruit, 4 oz. of sugar, and 1 pint of mountain wine. 

Cold Caudle. — Boil a pint of spring-water ; when cold, add 
tlie yolk of an &^^, the juice of a, small lemon, 6 spoonfuls of 
sweet wine, sugar to your taste, and syrup of lemons 1 oz. 

Flour Caudle. — Into 5 large spoonfuls of water rub smooth 
1 dessertspoonful of fine flour. Set over the fire 5 spoonfuls 
of new milk, and put 2 bits of sugar into it; the moment it 
boils pour into it the flour and water, and stir it over a slow 
fire 20 minutes. It is a nourishing and gently astringent food. 
This is an excellent food for babies who have weak bowels. 

B.ice Caudle. — When the water boils, pour into it some 
ground rice mixed with a little cold water ; when of a proper 



598 MODEEX DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXX^u 

consistency, add sugar, lemon-peel, and cinnamon, and a gla.s3 
of brandy to a quart. Boil all smooth. 

Or : — Soak some Carolina rice in water an hour, strain it, 
and put 2 spoonfuls of the rice into IJ pint of milk : simmer 
till it will pulp through a sieve ; then put the pulp and milk 
into the saucepan, Mith a bruised clove and a bit of white 
sugar. Simmer 10 minutes ; if too thick, add a spoonful or 
two of milk ; and serve with thin toast. 

Caudle for the sick and hjing-in. — Set 3 quarts of water 
on the fire ; mix smooth as much oatmeal as will thicken the 
whole with a pint of cold water ; when boiling-, pour the 
latter in, and 20 Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a 
good middling thickness ; then add sugar, ^ a pint of well- 
fermented table-beer, and a glass of gin : boil all together. 

This mess sent to any poor woman twice, and broth once or 
twice, will be of incalculable service. 

VARIOUS PREPARATIONS. 
864. — Saloop. — Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and 
ugar together ; then mix with a small quantity of the pow- 
ler, previously rubbed smooth with a little cold water ; stir it 
all together, and boil it a iew minutes. 

3Iilk Porridge. — Make a fine gruel of half-grits, long 
boiled; strain off; either add cold milk, or Avarm with milk, 
as may be approved. This is a most wholesome breakfast for 
children. 

French Milk Porridge. — Stir some oatmeal and water 
together ; let it stand to be clear, and pour off the latter ; 
pour fresh water upon it, stir it well, let it stand till next day ; 
strain through a fine sieve, and boil the water, adding milk. 
The proportion of water must be small. 

Abroad this is much ordered, with toast, for the breakfast 
of weak persons. 

Sago. — To i;)revent the earthy taste soak it in cold water 
1 hour, j)our that off^", and wash it well ; then add more, and 
simmer gently till the seeds are clear, with lemon-peel and 
spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and boil all up 
together. 

Sago 3Iilk. — Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly, and 
wholly with new milk. It swells so much, that a small 
quantity will be suflScieut for a quart, and when done it 



Chap. XXXI. COOKEEY FOR THE SICK. 59^; 

will be diminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or 
flavouring. 

Ground Rice 3Iilk. — Boil 1 spoonful of ground rice, 
rubbed down smooth, with 1^ pint of milk, a bit of cinnamon, 
lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly done. 

Water Gruel. — Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees 
into a pint of water, and when smooth boil it. 

Or : — Kub smooth 1 large spoonful of oatmeal with 2 of 
water, and pour it into a pint of water boiling on the fire ; 
stir it well and boil it quickly, but take care it does not boil 
over. In J of an hour strain it off; when eaten add salt and 
a bit of butter. Stir until the butter be incorporated. 

Barley Gruel. — Wash 4 oz. of pearl-barley ; boil it in 2 
quarts of water with a stick of cinna- 
mon, till reduced to a quart ; strain 
and return it into the saucepan with 
sugar and f pint of port wine. Heat 
up, and use as wanted. 

THE ETNA. 
865. — This useful little machine is 
almost indispensable in a sick-room. 
It enables you to have a pint of 
water boiled in a few minutes by 
means of a small quantity of spirits 
of wine burnt in the saucer under the 
cup. A little measure is sold with 
it, by which the quantity required The Etna. 

can be regulated according to whether the fluid to be heated 
is required to be boiled or only warmed. 

ASSES' MILK 

866. — Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. 
It should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being 
in a basin of hot v/ater. 

The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain in 
the stomach. At first a teaspoonful of rum may be taken with 
it, but should only be put in the moment it is to be swallowed. 
The animal should always be milked at the door. 

Artificial Asses* Milk. — Boil together 1 quart of watei, 1 
quart of new milk, 1 oz. of white sugar-candy, ^ oz. of eringo- 
T'oot, and ^ oz. of conserve of roses, till half be wasted. 




(vOO MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Ciiaf. XKXl. 

This is astringent, therefore proportion the doses to the 
effect, and the quantity to what will be used while sweet. 

Or : — Mix 2 spoonfuls of boiling- water^ 2 of milk, and an 
egg well beaten ; sweeten v/ith poiuided white sugar-candy. 
This may be t?.ken twice or thrice a-day. 

Or : — Boil 2 oz. of hartshorn shavings, 2 oz. of pearl-barley, 
2 oz. of candied eringo-root, and 1 dozen of snails that have 
been bruised, in ^ quarts of water to 1. Mix with an equal 
quantity of new milk when taken twice a-day. 

It should, however, be obser^'ed, that, although these pre- 
parations are all good in a certain degree, and some perhaps 
better, in a medical point of view, yet they do not afford the 
nutriment obtained from the original milk, especially in con- 
sumptive complaints. 

DR. B OERHAA VJE'S S WEE T BU TTER3IILK. 

867. — Take the milk from the cow into a small churn ; m 
about 10 minutes begin churning, and continue till the flakes 
of butter sv/im about pretty thick, and the milk is discharged 
of all the greasy particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain 
it through a sieve, and drink it frequently. 

It should form the whole of the patient's drink, and the food 
should be biscuits and rusks in every way and sort, ripe and 
dried fruits of various kinds, when a decline is apprehended. 

Baked and dried fruits — raisins in particular — make excel- 
lent suppers for invalids, with biscuits or common cake. 

Buttermilk, although thus recommended and generally 
thought most agreeable when made from sweet cream, is, 
however, by some preferred when sour, and is considered as 
more wholesome when in that state, as being lighter on the 
stomach. 

WHEY.—E. R. 

868. — Put 1 pint of warm milk into a vessel before the fire, 
and add to it i a tablespoonful of rennet. When the curd 
forms, cut it into squares to allow the whey to escape. Then 
put it on a sieve, and drain it carefull3^ 

The milk may also be turned with lemon-juice ; and the 
curds may be eaten with sugar and nutmeg, but not by a sick 
pefbon. 

In Ireland rennet is never used for this purpose ; the mode 
there being to turn the sweet milk with a mixture of sour 
butteniiilk. It is then called " tv/o-milk whey," and is far pre 



Chap. XXZvI. COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 603 

Apple Water is veiy delicate. Cut 2 large apples in slices, 
and pour 1 quart of boiling water on them ; or on roasted 
apples ; strain in 2 or 3 hours, and sweeten lightly. 

Or : — Peel and quarter 4 large rennet apples, or any otlier 
firm acid apple. Put them into 1 quart of water with the peel 
of ^ a lemon and a liandful of washed currants ; let all boil for 
1 hour, then strain it ; add sugar to taste. Let it stand till 
cold. A little wine may be added to it when about to be 
drunk. 

Orgeat. — Beat 2 oz. of almonds with a teaspoonful of orange- 
flower Avater and a bitter almond or two : then pour 1 quart 
of milk and water to the paste. Sv/eeten with sugar or capil- 
laire. Tliis is a fine drink for those wlio have a tender chest ; 
in the gout it is highly useful, and with the addition of ^ oz. 
of gum arable has been found to allay the painfulness of the 
attendant heat, i a glass of brandy may be added if thought 
too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass of orgeat 
may be put into a basin of warm water. 

Orangeade or Lemonade. — Squeeze the juice, pour boiling 
water on a little of the peel, and cover close. Boil water and 
sugar to a thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the 
juice, the infusion and the syrup, with as much more water as 
will make a rich sherbet ; strain through a jelly-bag. 

Or : — Squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water and 
capillaire. It is, however, still better when made with the 
juice of unripe grapes. 

The usual mode, however, of making* Lemonade is to pour 
1 quart of boiling water on the rinds of 6 lemons, and let it 
stand for 3 or 4 hours ; add the juice of the lemons with f lb. 
of sugar ; simmer it well and skim it ; then add another quart 
of boiling water. Either run it through a jelly-bag, or mix a 
glass of calf's-foot jelly, which will make it rich. 

Tamarind or Cranberry Juice, with double the quantity 
of water, forms a pleasant drink in a fever or for an invalid, 
when approaching to convalescence. 

The observation applies equally to the expressed juice of 
unripe grapes, from which, when used instead of lemons, is 
made the celebrated Gaspacho of the Spaniards, far superior 
to lemonade.

VARIOUS RECEIPTS AND DIRECTIONS TO 
SERVANTS. 



VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 

870. — Indian Cure for Hheuynatism. — Lemon-grass oil 
mixed with sweet oil, in the proportion of 1 spoonful of the 
former to 2 of the latter, and rubbed on the part affected. 

Hooping Cough. — The following remedy has been the 
means of curing hundreds of persons, but it must be steadily- 
applied, and if the disease is not of long standing a sensible 
amendment will be perceived in about a fortnight. A friend 
of above 50 years of age was cured by it after many other 
remedies had failed. 

Oil of amber (the foreign is the best) to be rubbed every 
night at bedtime on the palm of the hands, the soles of the 
feet, the small of the back, and the pit of the stomach. The 
oil, if good, is so essential that \ a teaspoonful is enough for 
a child at one time of rubbing. 

Or : — A dozen cloves of garlic steeped in ^ pint of rum for 
24 hours : rub a dessertspoonful over the pit of the stomach at 
bedtime. This has been found of great benefit. 

A Cure for Chilblaifis. — Take of ammoniac gum (the real 
drop) \ oz. ; reduce it into a smooth pulp with as little water 
as possible ; then add \ oz. of extract of hemlock, and 3 
drachms of the strongest mercurial ointment ; the whole to be 
well mixed together. When used it should be spread on soft 
leather and sewed on the feet, and need not be removed above 
once a week. For recent chilblains, and for their prevention, 
this plaister is infallible. The above quantity is sufficient for 
a family of 3 or 4 children for the winter if their feet are pro- 
perly attended to. 

For a Cough. — Take of treacle and the best white wme 
vinegar 6 tablespoonfuls each, add 40 drops of laudanum ; mix 
it well and put it into a bottle. A teaspoonful to be takei? 
occasionally when the cough is troublesome. 



CiiAP. XXXII. YAEIOUS RECEIPTS. 60u 

A Remedy for a Burn or Scald. — Apply immediately a 
thick covering oi wool to tlie burnt part, and bind it on tight ; 
in the course of ^ an hour very little pain will be felt, and 
scarcely any blister will remain. As this remedy is so simple, 
no housekeeper should be without loose wool at hand in case 
of an accident. This remedy was discovered by the ch:ld of 
a woolcomber having been dreadfully scalded : its mother Jaid 
it in a basket of newly carded wool whilst she ran for a doctor ; 
when she returned she found the child fast asleep amongst the 
wool, and when it awoke the excessive pain had subsided. We 
have frequently tried it, and invariably with success.

Spread the ointment on a piece of rag, apply it to the burr, 
or scald, and lay on it some scraped potato to keep the oint- 
ment from melting ; great relief will be found immediately on 
its application. 

For Cuts or Bruises. — A piece of fine linen dipped in gou- 
lard v/ater, or a few drops of arnica rubbed over the part. 

To destroy Warts. — Dissolve as much com.mon washing 
soda as the water will take up ; wash the warts with this for 
a minute or two, and let them dry without wiping. Keep the 
water in a bottle and repeat the washing often, and it will take 
away the largest warts. 

Blister. — Before applying a blister rub the part over with a 
few drops of olive-oil ; this will make the blister act quicker 
and with less irritation. 

FOR THE DRESSING-TABLE. 

871 . — To make soft Pomatum. — Beat J lb. of unsalted fresh 
lard in common water; then soak and beat it in 2 rose-waters, 
drain it, and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy ; let it drain 
from this ; add to it some essence of lemon, and keep it in 
small pots. 

Or : — Soak i lb. of clear beef-marrow, and 1 lb. of unsalted 
fresh lard, in water, 2 or 3 days, changing and l3eating it every 
day. Put it into a sieve, and, when dry, into ajar, and the jar

into a saucepan of M'ater. TlTien melted pour it into a basin, 
and beat it with 2 spoonfuls of brandy ; drain off the brandv, 
and then add essence of lemon, bergamot, or any other scent 
that is liked. 

Hard Pomatum. — ^Prepare equal quantities of beef-marrow 
and mutton-suet as before, using the brandy to preserve it. and 
adding the scent ; then pour it into moulds, or, if you have 
none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to be. "When 
cold, break the bottles, clear away the glass carefully, and put 
paper round the rolls. 

Or : — Take equal quantities of marrow, melted and strained, 
lard, and castor-oil ; warm all together ; add any scent you 
j^Iease ; stir until cold and put into pots. 

Pomade Divine. — Clear 1^ lb. of beef-marrow from the 
strings and bone, put it into an earthen pan or vessel of water 
fresh from the spring, and change the water night and morning 
for 10 days ; then steep it in rose-water 24 hours, and drain it 
in a cloth till quite dry. Take an oz. of each of the following 
articles, namely, storax, gum-benjamin, and odoriferous cypress 
powder, h oz. of cinnamon, 2 drachms of cloves, and 2 drachms 
of nutmeg, all finely powdered ; mix them v.ith the marrow 
above prepared ; then put all the ingredients into a pewter 
pot that holds 3 pints ; make a paste of white of e^^ and flour, 
and lay it upon a piece of rag. Over that must be another 
piece of linen to cover the top of the pot ver^^ close, that none 
of the steam may evaporate. Put the pot into a large copper 
pot with v\-ater, observing to keep it steady, that it may not 
reach to the covering of the pot that holds the marrow. As 
the vrater shrinks, add more, boiling hot ; for it must boil 
4 hours without ceasing a moment. Strain the ointment 
through a linen cloth into small pots, and, when cold, cover 
them. Do not touch it with an^-thing but silver. It will keep 
many years. 

A fine pomatum may be made by putting ^ lb. of fresh 
marrow, prepared as above, and 2 oz. of hog's lard, on the 
ingredients, and then obser\'ing the same process as before. 

Pot-pourri. — Put into a large china jar the following ingre- 
dients in lavers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers ; — 
2 pecks of damask-proses, part in buds and part blo^\•^l ; violets, 
orange-flowers, and jasmine, a handful of each ; orris-root sliced, 
benjamin, and storax, 2 oz. of each ; + oz. of musk ; \ \h. of 



Chap. XXXII. YArJO'JS EECEIPTS. 60*? 

angelica-root sliced ; a quart of the red parts of clove-gilly- 
fiowers ; 2 handfuis of lavender-flowers ; ^ a handful of rose- 
mary-flowers ; bay and laurel leaves, ^ sl handful of each ; 
3 Seville oranges, stuck as full of cloves as possible, dried in 
a cool oven, and pounded ; ^ a handful of knotted marjoram ; 
and 2 handfuis of balm of Gilead dried. Cover all quite cloie. 
When the pot is uncovered the perfume is very fine. 

A quicker sort of Siueet Pot-pour in. — Take 3 handfuis of 
orange-flovv-ers, 3 of clove-gillyflowers, 3 of damask-roses, 1 of 
knotted marjoram, 1 of lemon-thyme, 6 bay-leaves, a handful 
of rosemary, 1 of mjTtle, h of mint, 1 of lavender, the rind 
of a lemon, and i oz. of cloves. Chop all, and put them in 
layers, with pounded bay-salt between, up to the top of 
the jar. 

If all the ingredients cannot be got at once, put them in as 
you get them ; always throwing in salt with every new article. 

To make Wash-halls. — Shave thin 2 lbs. of new white soap 
into about a teacupful of rose-water, then pour as much boiling 
water on as will soften it. Put into a brass pan a pint of sv\-eet 
oil, 4 pennyworth of oil of almonds, ^ lb. of spermaceti, and 
set all over the fire till dissolved ; then add the soap and h oz. 
of camphor that has first been reduced to pov.der by rubbing it 
in a mortar, with a few drops of spirits of wine, or lavender- 
water, or any other scent. Boil 10 minutes, then pour it into 
a basin, and stir it till it is quite thick enough to roll up into 
hard balls, which must then be done as soon as possible. If 
essence is used, stir it in quickly after it is taken oft' the fire, 
that the flavour may not fly off. 

Paste for Chapped Hands. — Mix \ lb. of unsalted hog's 
lard, which has been washed in soft water, and then rose-water, 
with the yolks of 2 new-laid eggs, and a large spoonful of 
honey. Add as much fine oatmeal or almond-paste as vrill 
work into a paste. 

Or : — Blanch 1 lb. of bitter almonds, pound Ihem smooth ia 
a marble mortar ; add ^ oz. of camphor, 1 oz. of honey, i lb. 
of spermaceti, all pounded, and mixed with the almonds, till it 
becomes a smooth paste. Put it into jars or china boxes, and 
tie it down till wanted. 

Por Chopped Lips. — Put J oz. of benjamin, storax, and 
spermaceti, two-penny wortli of alkanet-root, a large juicy apple 
ci'opped, a bunch of black grapes bruised, J lb. of unsalted

butter, and 2 oz. of bees' wax, into a new tin saucepan. Sim- 
mer gently till the wax, &c., are dissolved, and then strain it 
through linen. When cold, melt it again^ and pour it into 
small pots or boxes ; or, if to make cakes, use the bottoms, of 
teacups. 

Or : — Put 4 oz. of olive-oil into a bottle with 1 oz. of alka- 
net-root ; stop it up, and set it for some days in the sun, shaking 
it often until it becomes perfectly bright. Then strain the oil 
from the alkanet, put it into a pipkin, and add to it 1 oz. of 
white wax and 1^ oz. of clarified mutton suet; set the mixture 
on a very slow fire to simmer for a little while, after which take 
it off, and, when it begins to cool, mix with it a few drops of 
any perfumed essential oil. 

Cold Cream will have nearly the same effect. Take 2 oz 
of oil of sweet almonds, 1 drachm each of white wax and sper- 
maceti, which scrape very fine, and put them with the oil intc 
an earthen pipkin to melt slowly on the embers, and stir it till 
it becomes quite smooth ; after which, when becoming cold, 
add 1 oz. of rose-water, and put it into a gallipot closely 
covered ; it should be a very thick cream. 

Thieves^ Vinegar. — " Take a large handful of lavender- 
blossoms and the same quantity of sage, mint, rue, wormwood, 
and rosemary ; chop and mix them well together ; put them 
into a jar v/itli tV cz. of camphor that has been dissolved in 
alcohol, and pour in 3 quarts of strong vinegar ; keep the jar 
for 2 or 3 weeks in the sun, and plunge it every night in a box 
of hot sand ; afterwards strain and bottle the liquid, putting 
into each bottle a clove of garlic sliced. It should be kept 
very tightly corked, and is best made in June." * 

Hungary Water. — To 1 pint of highly-rectified spirits of 
wine put 1 oz. of oil of rosemary and 2 drachms of essence 
of ambergris ; shake the bottle well several times, then let the 
cork remain out 24 hours. After a month, during wliich time 
shake it daily, put the water into small bottles. 

Honey Water. — Take 1 pint of spirit as above, and S 
drachms of essence of ambergris ; shake them well daily. 

Lavender Water. — Take 1 pint of spirit as above, essential 
oil of lavender 1 oz., essence of ambergris 2 drachms ; put all 
into a quart bottle, and shake it extremely well.

bit of bees' -wax as large as a walnut, and a large spoonful 
of sugar ; wet it all over with a large brush, and when dry 
rub it till bright. 

To give a fine Colour to Mahogany. — Let the tables be 
w^ashed perfectly clean with vinegar, having first taken cut 
any ink-stains there may be with spirit of salt ; but it must be 
used with the greatest care, and only touch the part affected, 
and be instantly washed off. Use the following liquid : — Into 
a pint of cold-drawn linseed-oil put 4 pennyworth of alkanet- 
root and 2 pennyworth of rose-pink in an earthen vessel ; let 
it remain all night ; then stirring well, rub some of it all over 
the tables with a linen rag ; when it has lain some time, rub 
it bright with linen cloths ; nothing, however, will be found 
equal to " elbow-grease." 

Or : — Mix equal quantities of cold-drawn linseed-oil and 
vinegar, the bottle to be well shaken before using the oil, which 
should be put on a piece of flannel and rubbed into the fur- 
niture. 

To take Ink out of Mahogany. — Dilute h a teaspoonful of 
oil of vitriol with a large spoonful of water, and touch the part 
with a feather ; watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a 
white mark. It is therefore better to rub it quickly and 
repeat if not quite removed. 

To give to Boards a heautiful appearance. — After washing 
them very nicely with soda and warm water and a brush, wash 
them with a very large sponge and clean water. Both times 
observe to leave no spot untouched ; and clean straight up 
and down, not crossing from board to board ; then dry with 
clean cloths, rubbed hard up and down in the same way. 

The floors should not be often Avetted, but very thorough^ 
when done ; and once a week dry-rubbed with hot sand and a 
heavy brush, the right way of the boards. 

The sides of stairs or passages on which are carpets or floor- 
cloth sliould be washed with sponge instead of linen or flannel, 
and the edges will not be soiled. Different sponges should be 
kept for the above two uses ; and those and the brushes should 
be well washed when done with, and kept in dry places. 

To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. — Make a strong ley 
of pearlashes and soft water, and add as much unslaked lime as 
it will take up ; stir it together, and then let it settle a few 
minutes ; bottle it, and stop close ; have ready some water ^.o 



616 MODERN DOMESTIC COOKERY. Chap. XXXil. 

lower it as used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor 
should lie long on the boards, it will draw out the colour ol 
tiiem ; therefore do it with care and expedition. 

To clean stone Stairs and Halls. — Boil 1 lb. of pipe-clay 
with a quart of water, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit 
of stone-blue. Wash with this mixture, and, when dry, rub 
the stones with flannel and a brush. 

Floor Cloths should be chosen that are painted on a fine 
cloth, Y/hich is well covered with the colour, and the pat- 
terns on which, do not rise much above the ground, as they 
wear out first. The durability of the cloth will depend much 
on these particulars, but more especially on the time it has 
been painted, and the goodness of the colours. If they have 
not been allowed sufficient time for becoming thoroughly 
hardened, a very little use will injure them ; and as they are 
very expensive articles, care in preserving them is necessary. 
It answers to keep them some time before they are used, either 
hung up in a dry barn where they will have air, or laid down 
in a spare room. 

When taken up for the winter, they should be rolled round 
a carpet-roller, and observe not to crack the paint by turning 
the edges in too suddenly. 

Old carpets answer extremely well, painted and seasoned 
some months before laid down. If for passages, the width 
must be directed when they are sent to the manufactory, as 
they are cut before painting. 

To Clean Floor-cloths. — Sweep, then wipe them with a 
flannel ; and when all dust and spots are removed, rub with a 
M^axed flannel, and then with a dry plain one ; but use little 
Avax, and rub only enough with the latter to give a little 
smoothness, or it may endanger falling. 

Washing now and then with milk, after the above sweeping 
and dry-rubbing them, gives as beautiful a look, and they are 
less slippery. 

To dicst Carpets a7id Floors. — Sprinkle tea-leaves on them, 
then sweep carefully. 

The former should not be swept frequently with a wliisk- 
brush, as it wears them fast ; only once a-week, and at other 
times with the leaves and a hair-brush. 

Fine carpets sliould be gently done with a hair hand-brush, 
such as is used for clothes, on the knees. 



Chap. XX.XII. DIRECTIONS TO SEBVANTS. 617 

To clean Carpets. — Take up the carpet, let it be \veii 
beaten, then laid down, and brush on both sides with a hand- 
brush ; turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox- 
gall and soap and water very clean, and dry it with linen cloths. 
Then lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. 

To blacken the fronts of stojie Chimney-pieces. — Mix oil- 
A'arnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of turpentine to 
thin it to the consistency of paint. Wasli the stone with soap 
and water very clean ; then sponge it with clear water ; and 
when perfectly dry brush it over twice with this colour, letting 
it dry between the times. The lamp-black must be sifted 
first. 

To clean the hack of the Grate, the inner Hearth., and the 
fronts of cast-iron Stoves. — Boil about i lb. of the best black 
lead with a pint of small-beer and a bit of soap the size of a 
walrmt. When that is melted, dip a painter's brush, and wet 
the grate, having first brushed oil' all the soot and dust; then 
take a hard brush and rub it till of a beautiful brightness. 

Another way to clean cast-iron and black Hearths. — Mix 
black lead and whites of eggs well beaten together ; dip a 
jjainter's brush, and wet all over ; tlien rub it bright with a 
hard brush. 

To preserve Irons from Rust.—lslQlt fresh mutton-suet, 
smear over the iron with it while hot ; then dust it well with 
unslaked lime pounded and tied up in a muslin. Irons so pre- 
pared will keep many months. Use no oil for them at any 
time, except salad-oil, there being water in all other. 

Fire-irons should be kept wrapped in baize, in a dry place, 
when not used. 

Another zvay. — Beat into 3 lbs. of unsalted hog's-lard 2 
drachms of camphor, sliced thin, till it is dissolved ; then take 
as much black lead as will make it of the colour of broken 
steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it thick on the stove, e^c, 
and the steel will never rust, even if wet. When it is to be 
used, the grease must be washed off with hot water, and the 
steel be dried before polishing. 

To take Rust out of Steel. — Cover the steel with sweet oil 
well rubbed on it, and in 48 hours use unslaked lime finely 
X3owdered, to rub until all the rust disappears. 

To take the black off the blight Hats of polished Stoves in 
a fciv minutes. — Kub them well with some of the following 



o:8 MODErtN D0:MESTIC cookery. Chap. xxxii. 

■Mixture on a bit of broad-cloth : when the dirt is. removed, 
wipe them clean, and polish ^vith glass (not sand) paper. 

For Mixture. — Boil slowly 1 lb. of soft soap in 2 quarts of 
water to 1. Of this jelly take 3 or 4 spoonfuls, and mix to a 
consistency with emery. 

To clean Tin Covers. — Get the fmest whiting, which is 
only sold in large cakes, the small being mixed with sand ; 
mix a little of it pov/dered with the least drop of sweet oil, 
and rub well, and wipe clean ; then dust over them some &ry 
whiting in a muslin bag, and rub bright with dry leather. 
The last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful to 
guard against by wiping them dry, and putting them by the 
fire when they come from the parlour ; for if but once hung 
up without, the steam Vvili rust the inside. 

Or : — 2 oz. of soft soap and t Ih. of ictten stone, beaten to 
a paste with boiling water. 

I^ine 13 lac king for Shoes. — Take 4 oz. of ivory-black, 3 oz. 
of the coarsest sugar, a tablespoonfid of sweet oil, and a pint 
of small beer ; mix them gradually, cold. 

T/ie Lest method of cleaning Knives. — Have the board 
properly prepared with leather, and clean the knives with 
equal quantities of rotten stone and iron filings. 

The machine for cleaning knives, invented by Kent, is one of 
the best household improvements that has been produced for a 
"-^ery long period. It appears rather expensive in the first 
instance, but the sa\dng of time in cleaning the knives, the 
absence of dirt, and the certainty of always having a brilliant 
polished blade, are advantages that cannot pass unnoticed in 
any establishment. It is particularly adapted to large families. 

They are to be procured at most of the ironmongers', and at 
Kent's shop in the Strand. 

To take Stains out of Marble. — jlix unslaked lime in finest 
pov>'der %\ith the stronger soap-ley, pretty thick, and instantly 
with a painter's brush lay it on the whole of the marble. In 
2 months' time wash it off perfectly clean ; then have ready a 
fine thick latlier of soft soap, boiled in soft water ; dip a brush 
in it, and scour the marble. This will, Vv'ith very good iTib- 
bing, give a beautiful polish. 

To take Iron-stains out of Marhle. — An equal quantity of 
fresh spirit of vitriol and lemon-juice being mixed in a bottle, 
shake it well ; wet the sjjots, and in a fev/ minutes rub witb 
eoft linen till they disappear. 



CiiAi'. XXXIIT. DTNXErv COUKSES. 62 1 

dinners, as likewise sauces, and servants bring tl>em round ; 
but some inconveniences attend this plan, and, v.hen tliere ai'e 
not many to wait, delay is occasioned. If the table is of a due 
size, the articles alluded to will not fill it too much. 

It is worthy of observation here, that cooks do not alvrays 
think of sending up such articles as are in the house unless 
ordered ; though, by so doing, the addition of anything, col- 
lared or pickled, some fritters, fried patties, or quickly-made 
dumplings, would be useful when tliere happen to be acci- 
dental visitors : and at all times it is right to better the ap- 
pearance of the table rather than let tilings spoil below, by 
which the expense of a family is more increased than can be 
easily imagined. 

Hot suppers are not much in use where people dine very late ; 
and when required, nothing boiled should ever be introduced. 
If fish be served, only the smaller sorts, fried, sliould be 
brought to table ; with the sole exception of shell-fish, which 
may be dressed hot in any way. When required, the top and 
bottom, or either, may be Game. .Fowls. .Rabbit. .Oysters 
stewed or scalloped. .French Beans .. Caulifiower, or Jeru- 
salem Artichokes, in White-Sauce .. Broccoli with Eggs.. 
Stewed Spinach and Eggs . . Sweetbreads . . Small Birds . . jMush- 
rooms . . Potatoes in shapes . . Scallops, &q. . . Cutlets . . Eoast 
Spanish Onions . . Salmagvmdi . . Buttered Eggs on Toast , .

Rusks buttered, with Ancho'\'ies . . Grated Hung Beef with 
Butter, w^ith or without Eusk, dressed in the middle of a 
plate, and surrounded with a garnish . . Custards in glasses . . 
Oysters cold or pickled . . Potted Meats . . Fish . . Birds . .^c. 
. .Good plain Cake sliced. .Pies of Birds or Fruit. .Crabs."" 
Lobsters . . Pi-awns . . Cray-fish, though usually brought to table 
cold, may yet be dressed hot, and, if well made up, are very 
good. .Any of the list of SAveet things or fruits. A sandwich 
tray with any of the above articles looks y\e\\, or placed at a 
little distance from each other on the table, without the tray, 
if preferred. 

The lighter the things, the better they appear, and glass in- 
temiixed has the best effect. Jellies, different coloured things, 
and flowers, add to the beauty of the table. An elegant 
supper may be served at a small expense by those who know 
how to make trifles tiiat are in. the house form the greatest pari 
of the meal.
