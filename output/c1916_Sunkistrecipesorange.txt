A Word to Housewives 

By Miss Bra dley 

THE recipes in this book were prepared for women who 
like oranges and lemons and who have learned that 
there is a wide difference between ordinary oranges and 
lemons and the selected fruit from California, which is sold 
by first-class dealers throughout the country under the 
name "Sunkist." 

It is interesting to learn why Sunkist Oranges are so 
good why they are as fresh, luscious and superbly flavored 
when they reach your table as if you had stepped out into 
your own yard and picked them from the tree. 

Sunkist Oranges grow in California, and only California 
sunshine and soil can produce the flavor and quality you get 
in Sunkist Oranges. 

These oranges are picked every day in the year and 
shipped, fresh, to all parts of the country. 

This golden fruit is grown, gathered and shipped by over

8,000 progressive growers, who have co-operated to form 
the California Fruit Growers Exchange, a wonderful organi- 
zation, which will be described later in this book. 

Now, just a word about the healthfulness of oranges. 

If every person would eat one Sunkist Orange a day, 
he or she would find the resulting benefit really surprising. 
Increase this number to two or three, and the benefits will 
be correspondingly multiplied, for this rich, sweet juice is 
one of Nature's most potent tonics and alteratives. 

A pure, live fruit juice, such as oranges afford, should be 
given liberally to children. Remember, that doctors put 

orange juice on the diet list of little babies. 

* * * # 

Sunkist Oranges peel easily, and the segments may then 
be separated and eaten from the fingers. When pared with 
a sharp knife the inner membrane can be removed with the 
peel, leaving a juicy, brilliantly-colored meat, which may 
either be sliced or taken out in sections and freed from 
membrane. * * * * 

Sunkist Lemons are superior in acidity, flavor, appear- 
ance, and general quality. The price is the same as you 
must pay for ordinary lemons. Therefore, you should insist 

on seeing the Sunkist wrapper 
when you order your lemons. 

Sunkist Lemons are waxy and 
bright, practically seedless; there- 
fore, easily sliced without marring, 
making them an ideal lemon for 
garnishing. 

The value of diluted lemon 
juice is well appreciated by phy- 
sicians. It may be taken in cold 
or hot water, plain or sweetened, 
to advantage. It clears the 
throat, sweetens the breath, keeps 
the gums in a healthy condition, 
and is excellent for internal dis- 
ideal Diet For Babies orders, such as biliousness.

The use of lemon juice to remove kitchen stains from 
the hands makes a lemon an indispensable article of the 
toilet. Lemon juice is also valuable in cleaning brass and 
copper, and in whitening a scoured table or sink. Lemon 
juice and milk, generously applied to ink stains on white 
goods, will remove the stains completely. 

In pressing the juice from Sunkist Lemons and Oranges, 
the glass or china squeezers are best and most convenient. 
The best orangeade is undiluted Sunkist Orange Juice, 
served in thin glasses, one-third full of cracked ice. For 
young children, strain the Sunkist Orange Juice through a 
fine wire strainer or through cheesecloth, and serve in a 
thick punch-glass. 

When recipes call for grated rind of Sunkist Oranges or 
Lemons, it is important that care be taken to remove only 
the yellow portion. The white portion of the skin of 
oranges and lemons is rich in pectin, the substance that 
causes fruit juices to jell when boiled with sugar. An ex- 
traction of this pectin can be added to the juice of straw- 
berries and other fruits, making a firm jelly of what would, 
otherwise, be only a thick syrup. 

Orange and Lemon baskets, shells and cups can be used 
for serving mixtures. The meat of the fruit should be re- 
moved with a teaspoon, 
and the edges cut with a 
sharp knife, scissors, or 
one of the patent cutters. 
Other methods of cutting 
lemons for garnishing may 
be seen in the illustrations. 
The tub with two handles, 
filled with Lemon Butter, 
holds a "tree" of water- 
cress. Sliced lemon, in the 
case, is made of the peel, 
cut down in long strips.

moved from the "pig" when lemon juice is needed on a 
piece of fish. Chopped parsley, paprika and small pieces 
of pimento decorate the notched halves of lemon, the slices 
and sections. A notched slice of lemon with a flower thrust 
through it is a pretty garnish in the fingerbowl. 

Oranges and lemons are at their best and most beneficial 
when uncooked, and there are numberless ways of thus 
using them in the daily menu. They should also be kept 
on hand to add to the variety of the table by using them 
in made dishes, as few dishes, of any kind, are complete 
without a little lemon juice; or, may not be improved by 
the use of an orange.

Sunkist 

Uniformly Good 
Oranges and Lemons 

TWO things about oranges and lemons should be em- 
phasized: 

First, they are very healthful fruits to which fact your 
physician will testify. 

Second, California oranges are a fresh fruit the year 
round. They are picked from the trees in California every 
day throughout the year, and are shipped by fast freight 
to all the markets of the land. They come to you sealed in 
Nature's germproof package. They are ripened on the 
trees, and you can get them fresh every month of the year. 
Some people are surprised to learn this fact about Sunkist 
Oranges. It is a very important fact to the thousands of 
housewives who realize the advantage of fresh, live fruit, 
not only from the standpoint of flavor, but also of health- 
fulness.

iiiiiiiiniiniiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin Sunkist Recipes 

Sunkist Oranges and Lemons together, as this book 
proves, lend themselves to scores of attractive recipes and 
household uses. 

There are two principal kinds of Sunkist Oranges from 
California the Sunkist Seedless Navel and the Sunkist 
Valencia Orange. 

Sunkist Seedless Navel Oranges 

The Sunkist Navel Orange is distinguished from the 
Sunkist Valencia by the navel formation at one end, and 
further, by the fact that the navel orange is seedless. Sun- 
kist Navels are on the market in the Winter and Spring. 

The meat of the Navel Orange is tender, but firm, and 
is bountifully supplied with a rich, full-bodied juice. This 
firm tenderness, which is a quality of the Valencia as well 
as the Navel, makes any Sunkist Orange ideal for slicing, 
segmenting, or cutting into small bits, for salads, desserts, etc. 

Sunkist Valencia Oranges 

Sunkist Valencia Oranges, as stated above, are firm, 
tender and juicy, like Navel Oranges, lending themselves 
just as readily to recipes. The Sunkist Valencia is an 
"almost seedless'" orange; only a few seeds being found in 
this type. Sunkist Valencias are on the market in the 
Summer and Fall months. 

Sunkist Lemons 

California Sunkist Lemons are practically seedless. 
They are particularly desirable because of their juiciness, 
their tart, full-bodied flavor, and the fact that they are 
picked, packed and shipped under the most cleanly con- 
ditions. 

Every Sunkist Citrus Fruit is picked by gloved hands, 
thoroughly cleansed with mechanical washers, and wrapped 
in clean tissue. Sunkist Oranges and Lemons will be delivered 
to you in the original wrappers if you request it of your dealers.

Another Important Fact 

The California Fruit Growers Exchange, through which 
is shipped all citrus fruits bearing the Sunkist trademark, 
is a co-operative organization of more than 8,000 California 
citrus fruit-growers, who annually produce 30,000 carloads 
of oranges and lemons. It accumulates no profits and 
declares no dividends. Its purpose is to develop better 
methods of growing, picking, packing and shipping citrus 
fruits, and to distribute them with the greatest economy, so 
that these healthful fruits may be available at reasonable 
prices. 

" Sunkist' 1 is the trademark of the California Fruit 
Growers Exchange, and the oranges and lemons packed 
under it are carefully selected. They may be obtained in 
several different sizes. Housewives can depend on the 
fruit marked Sunkist, and it is therefore important to 
insist on "Sunkist Oranges" and "Sunkist Lemons" rather 
than to order merely "oranges" and " lemons.' 

All recipes in this book were compiled and tested by 
Miss Alice Bradley, Principal of Miss Farmer's School of 
Cookery, Boston, and are therefore authentic and reliable.

Oranges For Health 

Dr. Harvey W. Wiley Says They Are Better Than Medicine 

Washington, July 8. Doctor Harvey W. Wiley, former 
Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of 
Agriculture, and universally admitted to be one of the 
greatest authorities on pure foods and dietetics in the 
world, says: "Eat oranges; eat them in Winter, eat them 
in Summer; eat as many as you can afford to buy; they 
are better for you than physic.' 

In an interview, Dr. Wiley says: "Oranges are ex- 
cellent for people. It is good to eat oranges for breakfast, 
and also for dinner not from a medical, but an anti- 
medical standpoint. Both oranges and lemons ought to 
be used as freely as the financial ability of the consumer 
may permit. A laboring man may not be able always to

PII IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIHIIIIII Sunkist Recipes iiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiii nun 

eat oranges at breakfast, yet the fruit is usually very cheap, 
and the consumption of it will obviate the need of physic 
and save many a doctor's bill. 

"Note, that I do not say 'eat an orange for breakfast/ 
but rather 'EAT ORANGES/ Even if in straitened cir- 
cumstances, people should eat plenty of oranges and lemons, 
not only in the Summertime, but all the time. I don't 
think anything I have ever said in praise of a fruit diet is 
too strong to say about oranges and lemons. The abundant 
production of oranges and lemons in California, their ex- 
cellent quality, and the cheap transportation across the 
country, have put these blessings to mankind within the 
reach of every person of moderate circumstances. 

"People ask, sometimes, whether oranges should be 
eaten at the beginning or end of a meal. It is better to eat 
oranges first; the effect cannot be so good after one has 
partaken of other food.' !

To Remove Pulp 
From Sunkist Oranges 

Pare the orange with a sharp knife, removing every 
particle of the thin inside membrane with the peel. This 
will leave the orange pulp exposed. Hold the orange over 
a plate, so that any juice which may drop will be saved. 
Insert the point of the knife at the stem end of the orange, 
close to the membrane that divides the sections. Care- 
fully work the knife in, separating the membrane from the 
section. Then carefully separate the section of orange 
from the membrane on .its other side; remove the whole 
orange section, complete in shape, and entirely free from 
membrane. Repeat until all the sections are removed. 



NOTE: In these recipes all measurements are made level. Measuring- 
cups, divided into thirds and quarters, are used, and tea and table 
measuring-spoons. Cups of dry material are filled to overflowing, by 
putting the material into the cup with a tablespoon, and are then leveled 
off with a knife. Tea and tablespoons are filled heaping with dry material, 
and then leveled off with a knife. 

Most of the recipes in this book are proportioned to serve four people.

Mackerel, -with Lemon 
Butter 

Split and bone mackerel, and 
wipe with cheesecloth. Broil, first 
on flesh side, and then on the skin 
side, over a bed of hot coals or 
under the gas flame. Make six 
triangular slices of toast, and

Cook just below boiling point until 
flesh leaves the bone, which will 
take from twenty to thirty minutes, 
depending on the size of the fish. 
Lift from the water, draining 
thoroughly; put on platter, and 
remove the skin. Pour over it Egg 
Sauce, or Hollandaise Sauce, and 
garnish with slices of Sunkist 
lemon and parsley. In serving, re- 
move flesh carefully, leaving bones 
on the platter. The lemon juice 
in Court Bouillon helps to keep the 
fish white.
