the Russian River. Office 128 Sutter St., San Francisco. 

Cream of Asparagus Soup. For two quarts of soup, use two 
bundles of asparagus. Cut the tops off and cook twenty minutes; 
pour in one pint of cream and one tablespoonful each of butter and 
Sperry Flour rubbed together. Serve with toasted wafers. 

Inquirer. 

Veal Gumbo Soup. Two pounds of fresh veal, one pound of 
fresh pork, one onion, parsley, one-half pound of okra. Cut the veal 
finely, also the pork; fry until brown. Cut the okra into small slices; 
add that with onion and parsley to the meat; stil until brown; 
add a pint of warm water, flavor with Folger's Golden Gate Pepper; 
let it simmer slowly; in twenty minutes add another pint of boiling 
water and two gills of claret wine. The soup is now ready for the 
table. Miss T. Hollingsworth. 

Tomato Cream Soup. Put a quart of sweet milk on the fire in 
double boiler, and a can of tomatoes in another saucepan. Add a scant 
teaspoonful of soda to the tomatoes when they have cooked suffi- 
ciently, and strain. Thicken the milk when hot with a tablespoonful 
Sperry Flour blended with a little cold milk or water. Mix together 
just before serving; also add seasoning just before mixing. 

Mrs. H. Wilson. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Cream of Celery Soup. One and a half pounds of lean veal, 
chopped; one moderately young chicken, jointed; add two quarts of 
cold water, and simmer until meat is cooked; remove the breast of 
chicken, and all best parts of meat; return the bones to the pot, and 
boil hard for an hour; strain, and let cool over night. (The chicken 
will make a dozen croquettes or a nice salad, and the soup is just as 
good without it.) About an hour before using the soup, skim off 
all the fat, and put the "stock," which should be a jelly, into a kettle. 
Let it slowly come to a boil, salt and pepper it, add a cupful and 
a half of good sweet cream, and two teaspoonfuls of Sperry. Flour 
made smooth in a little of the cream. Do not boil it now, for fear 
of curdling. Have ready a cupful of celery chopped fine; stew it for 
half an hour in a little salted boiling water; drain off the water, and 
add celery to soup. Have a teaspoonful of cracker crumbs in the 
bowl, and serve immediately, before the crumbs are soaked. 

Mrs. J. C. D. 

Tomato Soup Without Stock. One-half pound of good butter. 
Let it simmer. Add the heart of an onion sliced, six cloves, six 
Folger's Golden Gate Allspice, a small piece of red pepper, a blade 
or two of mace, and a .few sprays of parsley. When the onion is 
well browned add a quart of tomatoes chipped, or a can of tomatoes 
if it is in winter time. Cook slowly for an hour; strain, and add a 
tablespoonful of well-browned Sperry Flour made smooth in cream 
not enough cream to make the soup white. Of course, if you have 
stock, a cupful improves the soup, or two teaspoonfuls of beef extract 
is a good substitute for stock in any vegetable soup.

Cream of Celery Soup. Cut three heads of celery into half-inch 
pieces, and cook in one quart of boiling water until soft, then mash 
in the water. Cook one dessertspoonful of chopped onions and one 
quart of milk in oatmeal boiler ten minutes, and add the celery. 
Rub through a strainer, and put on to boil again. Cook one table- 
spoonful each butter and Sperry Flour together until smooth, and 
stir into the boiling soup one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-half 
saltspoonful of Folger's Golden Gate Pepper. Boil five minutes, 
strain and serve. Mrs. J. C. D. 

SAUCES. 

KINGAN'S Hams and Bacons are always best. 

Parsley Sauce. To be used with boiled chicken, boiled salt pork, 
baked white fish, boiled salmon, or lima beans. Take a large bunch 
of parsley, wash clean, boil with stems on in as little water as pos- 
sible, into which drop a piece of soda as large as a small pea, to 
keep the parsley green. When tender, take from the water, which 
must be saved; pick from stems; chop fine; add as much rich milk 
to the water as needed, a piece of butter the size of an egg, salt and 
Folger's Golden Gate Pepper. Stir in parsley; thicken and cook a 
few minutes. In serving with boiled chicken, cook the chicken in 
as little water as possible, boiling it down, if too much for the sauce, 
after the chicken is removed, and use this broth for the sauce instead 
of milk. Mrs. T. H. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Onion Sauce. To be served with either roast mutton or pork. 
Boil the onions until tender; chop fine after being thoroughly drained. 
Have ready half a pint of scalding milk, seasoned with butter, salt, 
and Folger's Golden Gate Pepper; a little cayenne. Stir in the onions 
and thicken; cook a few minutes and serve. 

~ SALADS. 

We recommend KINGAN'S Hams and Bacons.

one cup English walnuts; dressing, yolks of two eggs, two table- 
spoonfuls vinegar, two tablespoonfuls butter, one tablespoonful sugar, 
one teaspoonful salt; boil vinegar and sugar and salt, add eggs, stir 
until thick; remove from the stove and add butter before serving; 
add one-half cup whipped cream. L. R. E. 

Pepper Salad. One-half package white gelatine dissolved in one-

cup sugar, little salt; add half pint boiling water; cool and pour over 
two cups chopped cabbage, one cup chopped celery; about one-half 
can sweet Spanish red peppers. This is delicious.

Pineapple and Celery Salad. Cut both in dice-shaped pieces. 
Serve on lettuce leaves with salad dressing. E. R. L. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. One-half pint salad oil, one egg yolk, salt, 
Folger's Golden Gate Pepper, three or four tablespoonfuls lemon 
juice or vinegar. Have the ingredients all thoroughly cold. Add 
oil to yolk of egg, very slowly at first, but after a while it may be 
added more rapidly. When all the oil is used, put in the seasoning, 
and thin down to required consistency with the lemon juice or vinegar. 

Mrs. E. R. Lewis. 

Chicken Salad. One cold cooked fowl, two cups celery, salt and 
Folger's Golden Gate Pepper to taste, four tablespoonfuls oil, two 
tablespoonfuls vinegar, mayonnaise dressing, lettuce, hard-boiled egg 
and olives for decorating. Cut the fowl into dice, removing all skin 
and gristle; mix it with the celery, add the salt and Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper, and marinate for an hour before using with the oil 
and vinegar. Mix with mayonnaise dressing, and garnish with lettuce, 
hard-boiled egg and stoned olives, or strips of red pepper. 

Lobster Salad. Cut the lobster meat fn small pieces, but do not 
chop it; moisten with one tablespoonful oil and one of vinegar for 
one pint of meat. Season with a little cayenne, and keep it cold till 
served. Arrange it in a salad bowl or platter, with cup-shaped lettuce 
or with large leaves freshly shredded, and cover with mayonnaise 
dressing. A few slices of red radish, or rings from sliced beet, or 
sweet red pepper will give a bit of color; but eggs are unnecessary 
with such a salad. Mrs. Shank. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Tomato Jelly Salad. Soak one-half box gelatine in one-half cup 
cold water; dissolve in three cups boiling highly-seasoned tomato, 
strain and mold in cups and when chilled and firm serve on lettuce 
with dressing. 

Fruit and Nut Salads. Mix one cup each of freshly sliced apple 
and celery and one-half cup of crumbled walnuts. Dress with 
mayonnaise dressing and serve with lettuce. Mrs. Charlotte Weir. 

Boiled Salad Dressing. One pint vinegar, two tablespoonfuls 
Sperry Flour, two tablespoonfuls cornstarch, one rounding teaspoon- 
ful Folger's Golden Gate Mustard, one-eighth teaspoonful white 
pepper, one teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful sugar, four yolks 
eggs, one-quarter cup butter. Put the vinegar in upper boiler (if too 
strong use part water) and salt and Folger's Golden Gate Pepper, 
blend Sperry Flour and cornstarch smoothly with two tablespoonfuls 
of water; pour boiling vinegar slowly over mixture and return to 
boiler. Let cook while stirring until it thickens. Blend mustard and 
sugar and add to slightly beaten yolks of eggs. Put boiler over hot 
water in lower boiler. Remove from fire and add eggs and butter, 
beating in carefully with dover beater, to make dressing very smooth. 
Cool and put in covered glasses. When ready to use, add plain or 
whipped cream, in proportion of one-third cream to two-thirds dress- 
ing or equal parts.

Banana Salad. Slice very ripe bananas over lettuce leaves, allow- 
ing one large banana to each person. At serving time pour over 
them a well-made French dressing. 

Nut and Celery Salad. One cupful of English walnut meats, put 
in pan, add one slice of onion, a small blade of mace, and one-half 
bayleaf, pour over it one large cup of boiling water and boil about 
ten minutes or until walnuts will blanch easily, drain and dry in towel 
and cut meats into small pieces; mix this with finely-cut celery and 
mayonnaise dressing. Form cups of small head lettuce and serve 
salad in these. Mrs. C. 

Lobster Salad. Take the lobster out of the shell, wash in cold 
water, and put in vinegar for about five minutes, strain and cut in 
regular sized pieces; cut a few pickles the same sized pieces as the 
lobster, and a few hard-boiled eggs cut the same way, so it will be 
one-third lobster, one-third pickles, and one-third eggs. Mix with 
a dressing as for chicken salad, and keep cold. Kinsley. 

Cheese Salad. One-half cup mayonnaise dressing, one-half pound 
cheese grated or run through a meat chopper, celery salt and Folger's

shelled almonds, one-quarter pound shelled filberts, lettuce, cream or 
mayonnaise dressing, one dozen maraschino cherries. Remove the 
rind and the eyes of the pineapple and cut the flesh into small pieces, 
rejecting the hard core. Blanch the nuts by pouring boiling water 
over them and allowing them to stand a few minutes, when the skins 
can be easily removed. Chop finely and add to the pineapple. Pile 
in little heaps on lettuce leaves, cover with the dressing and decorate 
with cherries. 

Tulip Salad. Scald perfectly ripe tomatoes; remove skins and 
chill thoroughly; then with a sharp knife cut from blossom end to

wiches, trimming the edges neatly. Brown both sides in butter, in 
your chafing dish blazer. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

A Popular Sandwich. A sandwich greatly in favor among gen- 
tlemen, because it is substantial and appetizing and served at restau- 
rants of established reputation for excellence of their cuisine, as 
the Waldorf-Astoria of New York, is generally known as the "club 
sandwich." With a cup of coffee or cocoa it is almost a meal of 
itself. Cut slices of bread about y\ inch in thickness, remove the 
crusts and reserve one-half of slices to be used, plain. Toast remain- 
ing half very delicately, and butter, almost imperceptibly, so little is 
used. Broil very thinly-cut slices of bacon. Place strips of bacon on 
plain bread, cover with a heart leaf of lettuce, add mayonnaise dress- 
ing, daintily-sliced cold chicken, and finish with toasted slice on top. 
Serve on leaves of lettuce, garnished with parsley, or on doily without 
any garnish. 

Cucumber Sandwich. Pare a thin cucumber, divide in quarters 
lengthwise and slice very thin; keep them in ice water half an hour; 
drain on towel, mix with any preferred salad dressing, and spread a 
layer on thin slices of bread, cover with bread and press lightly. 

Egg Sandwich. Mince hard eggs very fine, mix with minced 
olives or cress, or parsley; moisten with softened butter or mayon- 
naise; season to taste and spread between sliced bread. Or combine 
yolks with an equal amount of potted ham. 

Pepper Filling for Sandwiches. Use the sweet bell peppers, re- 
move the seeds and chop fine, and mix with a very little mayonnaise, 
just enough to form a paste, and spread between thin slices of bread. 

Sardine Filling. Mince sardines very finely and remove all bones 
and skin; add a little French dressing with a little Folger's Golden 
Gate lemon juice. Spread on lettuce leaves; place between thin slices 
of bread.

Ducks and Turnips. Take ducks, either wild or domestic, place 
in stew-pan with small quantity of water; surround and fill ducks 
with turnips peeled and cut, season with salt and Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper, boil slowly for two or three hours on back of stove. 

T. Hollingsworth. 

Potted Pigeons. Clean the pigeons, tie in shape, then sprinkle 
with salt, Folger's Golden Gate Pepper and Sperry Flour. Place 
some thin slices of fat salt pork or butter, if preferred, in the bottom 
of an earthen jar or small porcelain kettle and lay the pigeons on it. 
Put a few slices of onion on the birds and pour over the whole boil- 
ing water to nearly cover. Cover the jar or kettle so that no steam 
escapes and set it in a pot of water where it will simmer steadily for 
two hours, or until the birds are tender. When stewed enough take 
up onto a hot dish, skim the fat from the gravy, thicken with a 
teaspoonful of butter and Sperry Flour rubbed to a cream, then add 
a spoonful of cream and a little lemon peel. Pour the sauce over 
the birds and garnish with parsley and sliced lemon. If desired, the 
pigeons may be stuffed before jugging. In this case, add to their 
giblets, minced fine, a little shredded beef suet, bread crumbs, pars- 
ley and marjoram to season, and one or two eggs to bind. 

T. Hollingsworth. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Rcast Beef. Take a rib or a loin roast of about five pounds; 
wipe it well with a wet towel; lay it in the dripping-pan and baste 
it well with butter; set it a hot oven; baste it frequently with its 
own drippings, which will make it brown and tender. When partly 
done, season with salt and Folger's Golden Gate Pepper; dredge with 
sifted Sperry Flour. Two hours will be required to roast. Remove 
the beef to a heated dish, add a tablespoonful sifted Sperry Flour 
to the gravy and one cupful of boiling water. 

Mrs. F. Elmer Buckman. 

Smothered Flank Steak. Lay the meat out smoothly and wipe 
it dry. Prepare a dressing, using a cupful of fine cracker crumbs, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, Folger's Golden Gate Pepper, a table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of savory, and enough milk to 
moisten all into a stiff mixture. Spread it over the meat, roll it up 
carefully and tie with a string. Place in the oven and roast one 
hour. Mrs. F. Elmer Buckman. 

Broiled Steak. For broiling, select only the choicest cuts from 
one inch to one and one-half inches thick; remove bone and surplus 
fat, trim edges and skewer into shape. Have broiler very hot, grease 
with bit of suet and place steak close to flame, to sear the surface. 
Turn, sear other side quickly and reduce flame or lower broiler and 
cook more slowly. Allow 8 or 10 minutes for steak one inch thick 
Serve on hot platter, pour over part of fat, season and garnish. If 
a sauce should be desired use mushroom or maitre d'hotel or a "Club- 
house" seasoning. Never pierce meat with fork while cooking.

Paprika Schnitzel. Cut two pounds of thick veal steak into 
small pieces; roll in seasoned Sperry Flour and fry brown in the fat 
from several slices of salt pork. Remove the meat from the pan 
and add two tablespoonfuls of Sperry Flour to the remaining fat; 
brown lightly and pour in gradually the strained liquor from a can 
of tomatoes. Add a slice each of onion and carrot, three or four 
bay leaves and a bit of mace, then return meat to the sauce; cover 
closely and simmer slowly three-quarters of an hour. When done 
remove the meat; season the sauce with salt and paprika and strain 
onto the platter. Mrs. H. Wilson. 

Hamburg Steak. A Hamburg steak is much more attractive and 
wholesome broiled in a wire broiler under gas flame than as ordinarily 
cooked by frying in a pan over a top burner. Form into rounds or 
oval shape about size of the hand, having edges as thick as the 
center, and, in broiling, turn from side to side, until cooked as desired. 
Serve with brown or tomato sauce. 

Roast Beef. Heat the broiling oven. Put roast in pan under the 
flame, searing all sides. When seared, dust with salt, Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper and Sperry Flour, and put trimmings of fat over the 
roast and in bottom of pan. If there is danger of flour browning 
too much, add a little water. Baste with the fat in the pan. Have 
oven hot at first to sear but not harden the surface of the meat. 
Keep turning the roast as it begins browning and baste frequently, 
and reduce heat after the searing, so as to cook more slowly. (It is 
a good plan to so manage your work that you can use the upper 
oven in baking while roasting meat in the lower.) 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

English Pot Pie. Slices of cold meat, one onion, salt, gravy, four 
potatoes; put layers of meat in the bottom of pie dish; then onion 
cut in small pieces; meat and onion alternately until the dish is almost 
full; pour in gravy to about three inches of filling the dish. Boil the 
potatoes separately, cut in slices; place over; bake in hot oven one 
hour. L. Semley. 

Steamed Veal Loaf (To be eaten cold.) Two pounds of lean 
veal and one cup of salt pork chopped fine (use the meat chopper, 
and grind meat moderately fine, as it makes a more compact loaf), 
one cup of freshly grated bread crumbs, two eggs, well beaten, two 
level teaspoonfuls salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper, a tablespoonful each of celery and parsley cut fine, one- 
half tablespoonful of onion juice. Put ingredients into an earthen 
bowl and mix well with the hands. Butter baking powder cans, or 
a mold, coat with bread crumbs lightly, fill compactly with the meat 
and cover with tight-fitting lid. Place cans on a trivet in kettle of 
boiling water reaching almost to top of cans. Let pound cans boil 
(or steam) about one and one-half hours. Do not remove from cans 
until cold. This is a nice luncheon meat at home, and especially nice 
for picnic purposes.

Beef L(v.f. Three pounds of rare beef chopped fine, one-half 
pound salt pork, one tablespoonful salt, ten tablespoonfuls of rolled 
crackers, one-half cup of milk, two eggs well beaten. Mix well and 
form into a loaf. Pour over half pint of water. Bake two hours, 
cool, and cut into slices. Mrs. E. Harmon. 

Yorkshire Timbales. Sift one saltspoonful of salt with one cup 
of Sperry Flour into a bowl; beat two eggs very light; add one cup

to make a smooth paste. Beat all well together. Use beef drippings 
from roast to grease hot gem pans. After timbales have risen, baste

easily managed and have more crust than same batter baked in pan 
with the roast. 

Jellied Tongue. Boil until done a large smoked beef tongue, 
saving a pint of the liquor; remove the skin, allow it to get perfectly 
cold, and slice as for the table. In half a pint of water dissolve 
thoroughly two ounces of gelatine; carefully take from a teacupful 
of browned veal gravy all the grease, stir in a small tablespoonful of 
sugar, one of burned sugar to color the jelly, and three of vinegar, 
then the liquor iVi which the tongue was boiled. Mix in well the dis- 
solved gelatine, then a pint of boiling water. Strain through a jelly- 
bag. As soon as it begins to set, pour a little jelly into the bottom 
of the mold, add a layer of tongue, then more jelly, until it is full. 
Set in a cold place to harden. When wanted, dip the mold an instant 
in hot water, and turn into a garnished dish. Mrs. W. T. S. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Fricassee of Chipped Beef. Shred one-half pound of beef. If 
too salt, freshen by pouring hot water over, to stand for a few 
moments, drain and dry, then, proceed to add two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter in a saucepan. Have the burner turned low (as little 
heat is required for "warming over" meats). Add two tablespoonfuls 
of Sperry Flour and blend well through the meat, then add two cups 
of milk and one-quarter teaspoonful of kitchen bouquet, and let sim- 
mer slowly for five minutes. Add yolks of two eggs, slightly beaten, 
turn off the burner; for heat of mixture will sufficiently cook the egg. 

Chicken Souffle. One cup cold chicken ground fine; two eggs; 
two-thirds cup of sweet milk; two tablespoonfuls butter and same of 
Sperry Flour; seasoning to taste. Put butter on in saucepan till 
melted, then add flour. When well blended add the milk, meat and 
beaten yolks of eggs and seasoning. Cook a few minutes; set aside 
to cool, and then add stiffly beaten white of eggs. Put in buttered 
pan and bake half an hour. Serve immediately. Cold veal is almost 
as nice as chicken. Mrs. H. Wilson. 

Pigs in Blankets. Pick over carefully one dozen large oysters; 
roll each in a thin slice of bacon, and fasten ends with a skewer. 
Put in hot pan or chafing-dish and cook till bacon is crisp. Season 
and serve hot. Mrs. E. R. Louis.

The ounce of protection in case of fire is the Badger Fin- 
Extinguisher, with which your home should be equipped fur 
the protection of your family. 




This machine can be handled by a -woman or child. The con- 
tents are harmless to health or fabric. Each gallon of tin- in- 
gredients is equivalent to 40 gallons of water in extinguishing 
a fire. 

If you have ever had a fire you know what could have been 
accomplished with a machine that would apply the equivalent 
to 40 gallons of water in a few minutes. 

If you never had a fire, you should profit by the experience of 
others, and also bear in mind that the damage is equival' 
3 gallons of water, provided you use the entire contents of the 
machine, which is unusual. 

The stream, which is shot 50 feet from the machine, can be 
stopped at any time, by inverting the tank. Every Badger is 
tested, labeled and recommended by the National Board of Fire 
Underwriters for use.

It is easy to tell why; no housewife ever had a bottle go 
back on her and no housewife ever will. Good extracts 
must be on your shelves. Grocers, if you sell Watkins Ex- 
tracts we need say nothing more to you; if you don't we want 
one order from you we are sure of more. You are certain 
of their absolute purity and a good profit.

Spend the summer at SUMMER HOME PARK, in the redwoods on 
the Russian River. Office 128 Sutter St., San Francisco. 

Cut slices of bread thin and toast, butter slightly, put on a platter 
and cover with the sauce. Put the yolk of the eggs through the 
potato ricer on top of all; garnish with parsley and serve hot. 

Mrs. I. D. Hamilton. 

Beaten or Virginia Biscuit. Two quarts of Sperry Flour; two 
tablespoonfuls of lard; one teaspoonful of salt. Mix with water and 
a little milk. Beat, or work until the dough blisters. Cut out and 
stick with a fork. Good for luncheon; best hot for breakfast. 

Mrs. M. Goodfellow. 

Biscuits. Sift well together a quart Sperry Flour, a level spoon- 
ful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of Folger's Golden Gate Baking Powder. 
Rub in two tablespoonfuls of shortening as lightly as possible with 
the fingers, just working until it is well blended with the flour. Mix 
to a very soft dough with the milk or water, having this always as 
cold as possible. Mix with a flexible knife in preference to either a 
spoon or the hand, as the steel blade of the knife is colder than the 
spoon, and also because it cuts and mixes the dough more thor- 
oughly. Turn dough on a well-floured board and roll or pat with the 
hands until about three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut into biscuits 
and lay, not touching, on a baking pan. Bake in quick oven 12 or 
15 minutes. The chief requirements of good biscuits are: 1 A very 
soft dough, so soft as to be almost sticky; 2 Very little handling, 
because much manipulation destroys their lightness; 3 Very quick 
oven. If not allowed to touch each other in pan, they will be much 
lighter and more delicate. G. H. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Parker House Rolls. One cake yeast, one tablespoonful sugar, 
one pint milk, lard size of an egg, one teaspoonful salt, Sperry Flour. 
Melt lard in milk, make stiff batter. Let rise, mix and knead thor- 
oughly; let rise. Roll half an inch thick, cut with large biscuit cutter, 
spread with melted butter, fold together, let rise very light. Bake 
in quick oven; serve hot. Mrs. R. E. Keys. 

Nut Bread. Four cups Sperry Flour, four teaspoonfuls Folger's 
Golden Gate Baking Powder, one teaspoonful salt, one-half cup sugar, 
one cup of chopped nuts. Mix dry ingredients up. Beat one egg, 
two cups sweet milk, and mix with other portion; put it in two deep 
baking tins and let it stand one-half hour before baking. Add a few 
raisins if desired. Mrs. Arnold Nelson. 

Dyspeptic Bread. Sift together one pint Sperry Flour, one tea- 
spoonful salt, two rounding teaspoonfuls Folger's Golden Gate Baking 
Powder. Mix to soft dough with milk or water; knead 2 minutes, 
turn into a greased pan, and allow to rise 10 minutes before baking. 
Bake slowly for 40 minutes. This bread can be eaten by those with 
weak digestion, who cannot assimulate bread prepared with yeast.

Timbale Shells. Mix three-quarters of a cup of Sperry Flour 
with one-half teaspoonful of salt; add two-thirds of a cup of milk 
and one egg well beaten; when perfectly smooth, add one tablespoon- 
ful of oil; dip a hot timbale iron in this batter, and fry the mixture

Quick Loaf of Bread (Made from Entire Wheat Flour). Three 
cups Sperry Flour, three teaspoonfuls Folger's Golden Gate Baking 
Powder, one tablespoonful sugar, one-half teaspoonful salt, one and 
three-quarter cups milk. Milk, more or less may be required, de- 
pending upon flour used. Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar 
and salt; add milk gradually, using spatula or knife for mixing. 
Make a soft dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. Cut and fold 
the dough, as success of bread depends upon this manner of mixing, 
and have a care that too much cutting is not done, as that would 
make a heavy loaf. Put on board, mold lightly in shape for a greased 
brick loaf pan. If good baking powder (pure cream of tartar or 
phosphate) be used, the loaf should be covered with oiled paper and 
allowed to stand 15 or 20 minutes before being put in moderate oven 
to bake. Maintain evenly a very moderate oven while loaf is rising. 
!)<> not remove paper until fully risen. Increase heat after 30 minutes 
and bake 40 to 60 minuter

two eggs well beaten, one cake compressed yeast in one-half cup warm 
water, three pints Sperry Flour, one teaspoonful salt, two tablespoon- 
fuls sugar. Mix stiff and mould; let rise four hours, roll out one- 
half inch thick and cut with large and small cutters; butter the 
larger and put smaller one on top; let rise till very light and bake 
20 or 25 minutes. Mrs. I. D. Hamilton.

CHAPTER ON SOUPS. 

KINGAN'S Hams and Bacons are always best. 

"I do not like the stock foundation, made, as it usually is, from 
bones, and by long and repeated boiling reduced to a stiff jelly which 
is kept for weeks. The best soups are made on the day they are 
to be served, or the day before, or from comparatively fresh stock. 
The best foundation for which is a shank of beef, boiled not longer 
that 6 or 7 hours. Strain, and when used, skim off the fat, which will 
be excellent to use. after proper clarifying. 

Xo foundation for soup is better than the bones from roast beef 
or mutton. Sometimes we put the bones on a gridiron over a clear 
fire before putting them to boil, adding any scraps of cold meat we 
may have on hand, and a tablespoonful of rice or two medium-sized 
potatoes cut in thin slices.

A perfect paradise for a summer home SUMMER HOME PARK 
in the Redwoods on the Russian River. Office 128 Sutter St., S. F. 

For the bones from a leg or loin of mutton, or rib roast of beef, 
allow from three pints to a quart of cold water, cover closely, boiling 
three or four hours. One-half hour before dinner, remove all the 
bones and meat, adding boiling water to make the required quantity 
if it has boiled down; salt to taste; small bunch of celery, cut fine. 
Cook 15 or 20 minutes, strain into warm tureen, and serve as quickly 
as possible. 

The flavoring may be varied; a chopped carrot, an onion, or a 
little browned Sperry Flour, or a quart of nice, ripe tomatoes may 
be used instead of the celery; or a real vegetable soup may be made 
by adding two potatoes, an onion, two carrots, one-quarter of small 
cabbage, or a small cauliflower, all cut in small pieces and put in 
the soup at least three-quarters of an hour before dinner. Removing 
nothing but scraps of meat and the bones, three pounds of the cheaper 
pieces of beef or mutton part of which is better will answer in 
place of roast beef bones. 

Soups should be made in porcelain-lined kettles; cook slowly 
and serve with toasted bread cut in small squares, or toasted crackers, 
bread sticks, or slices of bread cut into long, narrow strips. Or the 
bones and pieces from roast meat, especially if there is considerable 
fat, as in a loin of mutton, may be boiled in sufficient water for the 
soup the day before it is used. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

How to Make Bouillon. Bouillon is only another name for beef 
tea, but it is usually not made as strong as for an invalid's nourish- 
ment, and frequently vegetables are added, or flavoring, which are 
never found in the beef tea proper. 

The following recipe is an excellent one for serving at luncheons 
and dinners: To every pound of beef add a pint of cold water. Put 
on fire where it will not get more than lukewarm for three hours; 
then boil hard for ten minutes. Strain through cloth, and set aside 
to settle. 

When cold, put in beaten white and shell of egg, a little onion, 
carrot, parsley, and turnips; make a caramel of one lump of sugar, 
and strain again. Bouillon requires considerable salt. Do not pour 
the bouillon in the cups until guests are ready to come to the table. 

The soup and salad both came from a shin of veal weighing 
6 pounds. It was boiled very slowly and carefully in salted water 
to cover, until as tender as chicken; then after it had partly cooled 
in the water, it was taken out and set in a cool place over night. 
Next morning the meat was cut from the bones in pieces about the 
size of one's finger, and three-quarters of an hour before wanted. 
The soup was made from the liquor of the meat.

Favorite Bread Recipe 



Dissolve one cake Golden Gate Compressed Yeast and one 
tablespoonful of sugar in a cup two-thirds full of lukewarm 
water. Let this stand while you warm the mixing bowl, and 
get everything ready to make up the dough. 

If milk is used, scald it and allow to cool to lukewarm. 

Add to one pint of lukewarm milk (or lukewarm water 
if milk is not desired) one tablespoonful of salt, then pour 
in the cup of yeast and sugar (never put salt in the cup con- 
taining the yeast, as it will kill the yeast). 

Make dough as soft as can be handled, then work in a 
tablespoonful of melted butter or lard. When milk is used 
the butter and lard may be omitted. 

It is important to mix dough thoroughly, and not to work 
in the butter or lard until all of the flour is thoroughly taken 
up and worked into dough, as greased flour will not absorb 
yeast and water very well, thus interfering with the raising. 

Set in a warm place to rise, cover with cloth to avoid 
draught. 

When quite light (almost ready to fall), knead well, let 
raise for half hour longer, then make up loaves and let 
prove in greased pan well covered with cloth. 

When light, bake in moderately hot oven. 

Be careful not to give too much proof in pan, remember- 
ing that bread should be allowed to raise still more while 
baking. 

If you start your bread at 6 a. m., it should be in the oven 
by or before noon; thus it is not necessary to spend part of 
two days making a batch of bread, as is the case when the 
over-night method is used. 

If it is desired to hurry the bread through, use double the 
amount of yeast, being careful not to let the dough over- 
prove (get too ripe). 

If two cakes are used, bread can be started at 7 a. m. and 
be out of the oven by noon. 

It is not a good plan to use potatoes in the dough unless 
the potato flavor is particularly desired; potatoes add both 
cost and unnecessary work to the making of bread. It also 
destroys that delicious nut-like flavor produced by properly 
fermented dough, which is the quick method.

White Soup From Veal. "Carefully simmer one-half hour in 
three cupfuls of the meat liquid, one very small onion, three bay 
leaves, and four Folger's Golden Gate Cloves. Then add one cup 
milk, tablespoonful Sperry Flour, and butter well mixed and thinned 
with a little of the hot soup. Boil up once, add Folger's Golden Gate 
Pepper and salt. The cup used in measuring should hold one-half 
pint, so that there should be one quart of soup. For serving with 
white soups, small butter crackers, split, buttered, browned in an 
oven are best, and they certainly were delicious." 

For Tomato Soup. Take one quart of the bran stock and let 
one-half an onion and one-half can of tomatoes boil together for 
three-quarters of an hour. Strain, add a teaspoonful sugar, salt and 
Folger's Golden Gate Pepper, one cup milk, and, if the stock is not 
very rich, a small bit of butter. Thicken with about two tablespoon- 
fuls of Sperry Flour rubbed to a paste with milk or water. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

For Potato Soup, or puree, rather, boil five medium-sized pota- 
toes and one onion together until potatoes are ready to fall to pieces. 
Drain well, sprinkle with salt; have the stock hot and skimmed. 
Rub potatoes through colander into the hot stock, and to make it 
smooth stir in one or two tablespoonfuls of Sperry Flour blended 
smoothly in a little cold water, as in the tomato soup; add Folger's 
Golden Gate Pepper and teaspoonful chopped parsley. 

Easy Way to Make Soups. Why is it that so many people think 
it a hard matter to have soup for dinner, and why is it that those 
who have the most available materials for this purpose often use it 
the least? You do not necessarily need meat. Bran makes an ex- 
cellent stock and ought to be used by housekeepers, especially during 
the summer months, as it is inexpensive and contains much of the 
nutritive properties of meat. It is made in the proportion of one cup 
bran, six cups water, one-half teaspoonful salt. This should boil 
slowly 2 or 3 hours. Should then be strained and set aside to cool, 
forming a stock from which many varieties of soup may be made 
such as rice puree, vegetable soup, potato soup, etc. It all depends 
what you put with it. Have in the house always a bottle of celery 
salt, some bay leaves, Folger's Golden Gate whole cloves, five-cents' 
worth of bay leaves to be bought at a druggist's will last a dozen 
years. In perhaps a quart or more of the stock put, one hour before 
dinner, one-half onion sliced, three tablespoonfuls well-washed rice. 
Let boil gently. A few minutes before dinner add a teaspoonful 
celery salt. Folger's Golden Gate Pepper, and salt to taste; chop a 
little fresh parsley fine and put into tureen. It will not flavor much 
but will look pretty. A little here means a teaspoonful when chopped.

The rice, meantime, has boiled itself into a thickish substance, form- 
ing what is called a puree. Try it. 

For a vegetable soup, chop fine a medium-sized carrot, one-half 
turnip, one large onion; add small bay leaf, one Folger's Golden Gate 
Clove, and boil with as little water as possible for an hour. If you 
have any cooked or uncooked tomatoes, add a few spoonfuls. Let

Smith College Fudge. One-quarter cup butter; one cup brown 
sugar; one-half cup cream; one cup white sugar; one-quarter cup 
molasses; two squares Baker's No. 1 chocolate; one and one-half 
teaspoonfuls of Folger's Golden Gate Vanilla. Melt one-quarter cup 
butter. Mix together in a separate dish, one cup of white sugar, one 
cup of brown sugar, one-quarter cup molasses, and one-half cup of 
cream. Add this to the butter, and, after it has been brought to a 
boil, continue boiling for two and one-half minutes, stirring rapidly. 
Then add two squares of Baker's chocolate, scraped fine; boil this 
five minutes, stirring it first rapidly, and then more slowly towards 
the end. After it has been taken from the fire add one and one-half 
teaspoonfuls of Folger's Extract of Vanilla. Then stir constantly 
until the mass thickens; pour into buttered pan and set in a cool place. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Karo Fudge. Grate two squares or ounces of Baker's unsweet- 
ened chocolate, and stir into one-half cup milk; add two cups granu- 
lated sugar and one-third cup Karo corn syrup. Put over the fire 
and stir in two tablespoonfuls butter. When chocolate is melted, 
allow to cook slowly, stirring once in a while. When the mixture 
makes a soft ball between the fingers upon being dropped into cold 
water it is done. Take from the fire and turn in one teaspoonful 
Folger's Golden Gate Vanilla Extract, and beat. Granulation will 
soon begin, when the mixture must be immediately turned into a 
buttered pan. Mark deeply in cubes when nearly cold.

Good Olive Oil is as essential as Good Butter in order to obtain 
the best results in cooking. 

Olive Oil being the most-readily digestible and most wholesome 
fat, should be used in place of animal fats in the kitchen. 

MONTE SANTO OLIVE OIL is the best grade of California 
Olive Oil obtainable, warranted absolutely pure, is mild, mellow and 
smooth in taste. 

MONTE SANTO OLIVE OIL is selected each season from the 

crops of one of California's most reliable olive growers. Every pack- 

age is submitted to rigid examination, and careful attention is given to 

the bottling and packing, so that the natural rich, nutty flavor remains 

unaltered. 

We think you will appreciate one of our MONTE SANTO 
OLIVE OIL RECIPE BOOKLETS, which contains many excellent 
recipes and suggestions regarding the use of Olive Oil. If you care

HOUSEHOLD HINTS.

How to Preserve a Husband. Be careful in your selection. Do 
not choose too young, and take only such varieties as have been 
reared in a good, moral atmosphere. When once decided upon and 
selected, let that part remain forever settled, and give your entire 
thought to preparation for domestic use. Some insist on keeping 
them in a pickle; others are constantly getting them into hot water, 
liven poor varieties may be made sweet, tender and good by gar- 
nishing them with patience, well sweetened with smiles and flavored 
with kisses to taste. Then wrap well in a mantle of Charity. Keep 
warm with a steady fire of domestic devotion, and serve with peaches 
and cream. When thus prepared, they will keep for years.

Marketing. At the World's Food Fair held in Boston a few 
years ago Mrs. A. D. Lincoln gave a most interesting talk on mar- 
keting, the substance of which was as follows: 

"In different cities beef is cut differently, but if one has the right 
knowledge regarding the structure, and fat and lean parts, there will 
be no trouble in purchasing. 

"In Boston three ribs are left on the hind quarter. In cutting 
this up the flank is removed first, composed of thin layers of meat 
covered with fibres, giving a peculiar texture, yet juicy. Nearest

the leg the meat makes a nice beef roll, or it can be stuffed and 
steamed. Some of the tenderest parts of the animal are along the 
back, while the juicy parts are taken from the leg. 

"To illustrate all the various parts, a market man cut a leg of 
beef into sections. First, the aitch bone was removed. This makes 
a nutritious soup. While the adjoining top of the round steak is a 
more expensive cut, the lower parts make the best meats for braising 
<>r pot-roasting. Toward the end, where there are more cords and 
tendron-. the pieces are good for spiced beef, while the shin is 
suitable only for soup stock. 

"A good way to cook the top of the round is to have it cut 
2 or 3 inclu-s thick. Sear both surfaces over a hot fire, then hold it 
high over the coals and let it cook very slowly. 

"Tin- face of the rump is full of juice, and when roasted rare 
is delicious. Tenderloin is cheaper when cut from the rump. A 
choice roasting piece comes from the back of the rump, as it is 
tender, although lacking in flavor, which can be imparted to it by 
mushrooms and other sauces. In carving it should be cut across the 
grain. The whole hind-quarter being hung up after it is cut. much 
juice settles in this particular part. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

"The loin and the sirloin were next considered. The bulging 
muscle makes that part rather undesirable, but as it is cut farther 
down it improves in quality. In Boston Market the second cut is 
considered the best. The extreme end or tip of the sirloin is juicy 
and is generally bought for roasting. It is preferable to even the 
1>e-t cut- from the rib. 

"In the fore-quarters are parts with thick lean meats, suitable 
for various styles of cooking, except roasting. The brisket is particu- 
larly go<>d for corning. 

".Mutton is cut about the same as beef, after the first division 
of the animal. Through the loins are to be found the best parts 
for roasting and for chops. Never be afraid of buying fat, said Mrs. 
Lincoln, either in beef or mutton, as the meat is always of finer 
flavor when surrounded by fat. The outer skin should be cut off 
before it is cooked. Loin or kidney chops, cut thick, are the ones 
io buv. Those already rolled up and skewered together with equal 
layers of lean and fat are delusions. They would do very well for 
corned beef, or perhaps to stew, but never to broil. The fore- 
quarter is good if boned, steamed or broiled until tender, then baked." 

In Serving Birds, a good rule to remember is that the leg of a 
living bird and the wing of a swimming bird are the choicest portions.

Macaroni and Vermicelli arc very nice soups. Either may be 
added to soups not previously thickened by either rice or potatoes. 
Wash carefully and put in saucepan with cold water to cover; heat 
gradually, and when hot add to soup 20 minutes or half an hour 
before serving. Macaroni should be broken in pieces an inch or less 
in length. Brown soups are easily made by the addition of a table- 
spoonful of browned Sperry Flour. A teacupful may be browned 
at once, putting it when cold into closely covered glass jar. It will 
be found very convenient and will keep a long time in any cool 
closet. To prepare it, put the Sperry Flour, a little at a time, in a 
hot fry pan, stir rapidly, being careful not to scorch, as it is then 
unfit for use. When a rich dark brown, it is done. 

A brown soup made in the following manner is a favorite with us: 
Procure a round steak, allow a pound of meat to each quart of 
soup required, the rule given being for that quantity. Broil the meat 
over a very hot fire a little. Should be well browned on each side 
and cut in small pieces. Put in stew pan with quart of cold water 
and tablespoonful of rice. Cover and cook slowly one hour; then 
add an onion, one small carrot chopped fine, one sliced potato cut 
in small pieces, salt, cover and cook three-quarters of an hour. 
The vegetables may be omitted if desired. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Care of Meat Chopper. Take a round piece of cloth, run a 
rubber in it, and keep it over the top of the meat chopper. No dust 
can get in, and it will always be ready for use. Mrs. G. Lewis. 

Mold on Preserves. Mold can be kept from the top of preserves 
by putting a few drops of glycerine around the edges of the jar 
before screwing on the cover. Mrs. E. R. Lewis. 

Canned goods should always be removed from the case as soon 
as opened, and allowed to stand a while before being used. 

In purchasing canned goods, examine the cans carefully, and if 
the sides bulge outward reject them, as that denotes the presence 
of gas which renders the contents unfit for use. 

Store all canned goods in a cool, dry, dark place, as it is very 
beneficial to the contents.

The boating and bathing at SUMMER HOME PARK cannot be sur- 
passed. Write for booklet, 128 Sutler St., San Francisco. 

Roast Turkey. The turkey should be killed and dressed at least 
two days in advance. Make a force meat of grated bread crumbs, 
Folger's Golden Gate pepper, salt, sweet marjoram, minced suet, and 
beaten yolk of egg. Chop the liver, gizzard and heart for the gravy. 
Stuff the craw and the body, and sew the openings. Dredge with Sperry 
Flour, and put the bird into the bake pan, with the bottom well cov- 
ered with water. Baste every half-hour with butter. 

Boned Turkey. This is a favorite dish at evening parties, and 
may be thus prepared: Boil a turkey in as little water as you can, 
until the bones can be separated from the meat. Remove all the skin; 
slice, mixing together the light and dark parts. Season with salt and 
pepper. Take the liquid in which the turkey was boiled, having kept 
it warm, and pour it on the meat; mix it well. Shape it like a loaf of 
bread, wrap it in a cloth, and press with a heavy weight for a few 
hours. When served, it is cut into thin slices. Chickens can be pre- 
pared in the same way. 

Chicken Patties. Chop very fine all the dry, poorest bits left 
from baked chicken; season carefully with pepper, salt, and a little 
celery, cut into small bits; make a light puff paste; roll a quarter of 
an inch thick; cut with a neatly-shaped paste cutter; lay a narrow 
strip of the paste all round, then put some of the mince on the paste; 
cut another piece of the same size and lay over. Bake fifteen minutes. 
This makes a neat dish, and is good. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Cheese Straws. One cup grated cheese, one-half scant cup butter, 
one cup Sperry Flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-eighth teaspoon- 
ful Folger's Golden Gate Paprika, yolk of one egg, two tablespoonfuls 
milk or water. Knead ingredients well together, roll out crust one- 
quarter inch thick, cut in narrow strips about 4 or 5 inches long, lay 
on wet dripping pan, not touching each other, and bake in quick- 
oven. May be cut in circles, part of crust, and served by placing 
strips in rings tied together with ribbons, or pile log-cabin fashion 
on plate. Very dainty with salads. Some housekeepers like the cheese 
straws made from pastry rolled thin and cheese sprinkled between 
two layers, cut in strips and baked. 

Perfect Fish Balls. Cut enough raw potatoes in small pieces to 
fill two cups. Cook with one cup flaked codfish till potatoes are 
tender. Wash thoroughly till every lump is gone. Add one table- 
spoonful of butter, one-sixth teaspoonful of Folger's Golden Gate 
Pepper, one egg. Beat till whole is light and creamy. Take up a 
little of the mixture at a time with a spoon that has been dipped in 
hot fat; this prevents mixture sticking to spoon; and drop into pan 
with plenty smoking hot fat. Cook golden brown; if fat is right 
heat, tliis will not take more than a minute. Drain well. Serve with 
or without bacon. ^ rs - G. H.

Instead of Lunch Drink 
A.W. Fink's Buttermilk 

The scientific explanation of 
the effect of buttermilk is that 
it corrects the digestion so that 
nourishment taken into the body 
is used only for necessary pur- 
poses and does not go to the 
formation of fat cells. Butter- 
milk satisfies the craving of 
hunger and yet gives no nourish- 
ment of a fattening nature. 

Whenever you feel hungry, 
take a drink of buttermilk.

Melton Veal. Veal may be cooked in dozens of ways. It is not 
as nutritious as beef or mutton, but in many places is much cheaper. 
Cooked with ham or bacon, it has a fine flavor. One method of cook- 
ing the two combined, is to line a large bowl, well buttered, with 
slices of hard-boiled eggs. Then alternate thin slices of veal and ham, 
sprinkling pepper, salt and grated lemon rind, on the veal; pepper and 
lemon on the ham. Fill the bowl nearly to the brim; make a thick 
paste of Sperry Flour and water; cover over the top, and press tight 
on the outside edges of the bowl. Put in water, but not enough to 
boil over the paste, and boil three hours. Leave the paste on till 
nearly cold; do not turn it out of the bowl till the next morning; then 
if the bowl was well buttered, you will find a very appetizing dish. 
Cut into very thin slices, and it is excellent as a supper, breakfast, or 
side dish at dinner. It is styled Melton veal, because it was much 
used, in years past, at the Melton races. 

Beef Steak. Probably no point in cookery is less thoroughly 
understood than that of preparing beef steak, so as to be palatable, 
and suitable for food. Beef steak is best, when prepared by broiling 
over a hot fire of live coals. Beef cooked in this way, will not require 
more than three or four minutes for its preparation. The meat should 
be lean and tender. Sprinkle it with salt; and place it upon a small 
broiler. In about two minutes, turn it, and broil as before. You will 
be surprised at its tenderness. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Roast Beef. Rub the piece with salt; then place it into a well- 
heated oven, but be careful to prevent burning. Twenty minutes be- 
fore it is done, pour off the grease; thicken with browned Sperry 
Flour, and season with salt and Folger's Golden Gate pepper. It 
will be much more palatable if served immediately. 

Corned Beef. In cooking corned beef, it should be put into boil- 
ing water when put on to cook, and when it is done it should remain 
in the pot until cold. This is the whole secret of having corned beef 
juicy and well-flavored, instead of the contrary. 

SICK ROOM RECIPES. 
We recommend KINGAN'S Hams and Bacons. 

Sick Room Recipes. If a physician order raw beef for a patient, 
this is a nice way to prepare it: Scrape fine a small piece of juicy, 
tender beef, seasoned highly with salt and Folger's Golden Gate 
Pepper, spread on thin slices of bread put together like sandwiches, 
and cut into small squares. These may be toasted slightly. 

Beef Croquettes. Beef croquettes are made by scraping a suffi- 
cient quantity of raw beef, sprinkle a little salt and Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper over, and shape into little balls, and put in a hot frying-

pan which lias been well sprinkled with salt; shake the pan so that 
the balls may be heated alike on all sides. 

Beef Tea. Chop tine one pound of beef, add one and one-half 
pints of cold water, into which have been put 8 drops of muriatic 
acid and a pinch of salt; after an hour, drain off the fluid without 
pressure, add half a pint of cold water poured over the beef, strain 
it all and use it as a drink, very cold. Cannot be kept long in warm 
weather. 

2. Make beef tea in the ordinary way: A pound of chopped 
beef to a pint of cold water, cooked very slowly until the beef is 
hard, strain off the juice which should be a clear liquid-like water; 
have it frozen, and give to the patient in little lumps like cracked ice. 

3. Take beef juice as in No. 2, add a tumbler of boiled milk, 
slightly and evenly thickened with Sperry Flour, flavor with bits of 
celery or celery seeds, which are to be taken out before serving, add 
salt, and call it white celery soup. 

4. Slightly boil a pound of lean beef (the '"round" is best); cut 
into strips, and squeeze out the juice. Give it cold with a little salt 
and celery essence; a tablespoonful of claret wine may be added. 
A pound of beef makes about three tablespoonfuls af juice. This 
is often preferred to beef tea. 

The following are often preferred to beef tea: 

1. Put a quart of milk into a large perfectly clean bottle; drop 
in the whites of three raw eggs; cook it and shake hard. 

2. To one pint of milk (sugar and vanilla to taste) slightly 
warmed, stir in a dessertspoonful of essence of pepsin (Fairchild), 
and set on ice. Serve with cream. 

"Always order your groceries over the HOMEPHONE." 

Wine Whey. Boil a tumbler of milk, and as it rises throw in 
a wine-glass of sherry, giving one stir round the edges; let it stand 
over the fire until the curd sets; strain it; sweeten and ice.it. 

Cream of Rice Soup. Half a pint of chicken broth strained; 
add to it two tablespoonfuls of rice; let it simmer for two hours, 
strain, and then add a half-pint of cream, salt to taste; let it come 
just to the boiling point. If the patient can bear it, Folger's Golden 
Gate Pepper, celery, or a soupscore of onion may be added. 

DELICIOUS DESSERTS. 

Use KINGAN'S Hams and Bacons. 

Charlotte Russe. Line a plain round or oval mold with lady 
fingers dipped in white of egg. Beat one pint of cream stiff, add 
three tablespoonfuls sugar, arid one teaspoonful of Folger's Golden 
Gate Vanilla, and the stiffly beaten whites of two eggs. Pour into 
the lined mold, and stand on ice one hour before serving. A. E. P.

of vanilla bean in with the milk when first put on fire, and strain 
custard to remove the pods. The small seeds will still remain, but 
that does not matter. Mrs. H. Wilson.
