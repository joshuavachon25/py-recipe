NOTE 



JANE HAMILTON, who was married to 
John Marye, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, 
was the youngest child of George Hamilton 
of " Forest Hill," the Hamilton home near 
Fredericksburg, which was burned during the 
Civil War. 

As far as is known the recipes contained in 
this little book have, up to the present time, 
never been in print. They were originally 
collected and for many years used by Jane 
Hamilton's mother, at '' Forest Hill," and 
the faded leaves upon which they were pre- 
served — written out in script half a century 
ago — have been in the possession of Mrs. 
Poindexter since the death of her mother, 
Susan Gibbon Thornton Mason, who was 
Jane Hamilton's niece. 

These recipes, while not covering the vari- 
ety of so-called ^'good things to eat" included 



NOTE 

in most modern cook-books, stood in very 
good stead of the *' modern " cook-book 
during the period when, as is well known, 
^'Virginia hospitality'' meant very good 
things to eat. They have been tried by rep- 
resentative housewives of several genera- 
tions and the thoroughness of the test has 
necessarily limited the number now handed 
down ; but by those who have used them, 
they have been found sufficient and in every 
way satisfactory. They have already at- 
tracted attention in army circles, where they 
are known and where superior cooking is 
also appreciated. A good deal of butter and 
cream is called for, and a good many eggs, 
but this is doubtless a part of the secret why 
Virginia cooking is so noted.

SOUPS 



JANE HAMILTON'S 
RECIPES 



SOUPS 

ASPARAGUS. 

Take a chicken, or about two pounds of 
good veal or lamb, and put it on in sufficient 
water to make the soup. Cut into slices 
about half an inch thick some fresh aspara- 
gus. To make two quarts of soup take three- 
quarters of a quart of sliced asparagus. 
When the meat and asparagus are done, or 
about ten minutes before serving up the 
soup, add a little thickening, a pint of rich 
milk, a large slice of butter, and season with 
salt and black pepper. 

BEEF. 

Take the shin of a hind quarter of fat 
beef, break the bone in two or three places, 
and put it on with a sufficient quantity of 
water six hours before dinner. Keep it 

{t3) 



ssa 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

boiling constantly. About two hours before 
dinner take a good head of cabbage, strip 
off the outer leaves and cut it all into shreds 
except the stalk, then put it in the soup. 
Take six small turnips, cut them into little 
pieces and add to the soup. About fifteen 
minutes before dinner put in a very little 
thickening and season with salt and black 
pepper. This will make four quarts of rich 
soup. 

Another way of making beef soup is to 
take about four pounds of good beef, cut it 
into little pieces, and put it on in water suffi- 
cient to make two quarts of soup. Boil for 
about four hours. Thicken with brown flour, 
add the salt and black pepper, and season 
with thyme ; or a large silver onion chopped 
fine and two tablespoonfuls of pounded all- 
spice and half a tablespoonful of powdered 
cloves. 

BLACK. 

Take the neck and shanks of a fat veal and 
half a pound of fat bacon and boil them for 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about three hours. Then add the following 
ingredients for seasoning : two large onions, 
chopped fine; three tablespoonfuls of all- 
spice. Beat very fine a little thickening, and 
salt and pepper to your taste. Let it boil 
until the onion is done. This will make two 
quarts of good soup. The meat when it is 
cooked enough to separate from the bone is 
taken off and cut up into little pieces and 
boiled to shreds in the soup. Take out the 
bacon when the soup is served up. 

■ 

CATFISH CHOWDER. 

Take as many catfish as will weigh three 
pounds. Put about a pound of fat bacon on 
the fire with as much water as will be suffi- 
cient for the chowder. Put this on two hours 
before dinner. Dip the fish in hot water and 
take off the skin; then put them back on 
the fire in the pot with the bacon, after cut- 
ting them into small pieces, and boil them 
until they are done. Then take out every 
bone and add two large onions, chopped 

(/5) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

very fine, a little thickening, and season with 
salt and pepper. As soon as the onion is 
done, add half a pint of milk with the yolks 
of two eggs beat up and stirred in it, and a 
large slice of butter. Parsley is thought by 
some to be an improvement to the chowder. 
As soon as the milk, eggs, and butter are 
stirred in serve up the chowder. Chowder 
is very good made without the eggs and milk 
and with a rather large piece of bacon cut 
into little pieces. The above will make two 
quarts of good chowder. 

DRIED PEA. 

Take a pint of the small white peas, wash 
them well and soak them for an hour or two, 
then put them on to boil in sufficient water 
to make two quarts of soup, with a slice of 
nice fat bacon. When it has boiled between 
two and three hours strain the soup through 
a fine colander and add a large slice of 
butter, a little thickening, and season with 
salt and pepper. Dried Lima beans or the 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

common white bean make nearly as good 
soup as the small white pea. 

GREEN PEA. 

Put on the fire in an iron pot a large fat 
chicken and a slice of bacon, in water suffi- 
cient to make two quarts of soup, two hours 
before dinner. After boiling for about an 
hour put in two quarts of green peas. About 
ten or fifteen minutes before dinner strain 
the soup through a fine colander and add 
a very little thickening, salt, and black 
pepper. Some persons like the soup thin- 
ner than this quantity of peas will make it. 
This soup may be made with bacon, with- 
out the chicken, but it is not so good. 

MOCK TURTLE. 

Clean head in the usual manner, by scrap- 
ing off the hair, and split in two, taking 
out the brains. Bdil the head until it is 
perfectly tender. Then take it out of the 
water, separate it from the bones and hard 



M I 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

part inside the mouth and the gristle of the 
ears, cut the tongue and other parts into 
small pieces, and put the meat back into the 
pot. The soup will be much improved by 
adding at this time two or three pounds of 
fat veal cut into little pieces. Boil steadily; 
half an hour before serving up the soup 
add two large silver onions chopped fine, 
thyme, parsley, a teaspoonful of pounded 
mace, the same of cloves, salt, and red 
pepper to the taste. Thicken the soup with 
browned flour and add a quarter of a pound 
of good butter. Just before serving up the 
soup season with Madeira wine to the taste. 
The above will make three quarts of rich 
soup. The brains must be made into little 
thin cakes, fried, and put into the tureen 
just before pouring in the soup, or on top 
of the soup after pouring it in. 

« 

MUTTON SOUP A LA SQUIRREL. 

Take the neck and shanks of a fat mut- 
ton, cleansing them properly, or three pounds 

{t8) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

of good mutton. Put it on to boil about 
four hours before dinner in water sufHcient 
to make two quarts of soup. About twenty 
minutes before dinner cut up and put in the 
soup a large silver onion, season with salt 
and black pepper, and ten minutes before 
serving up the soup put in a very little 
thickening. Lamb soup may be made in 
the same manner, but lamb not being such 
fat meat as mutton requires more meat to 
make the soup as rich. 

OKRA. 

Take a large fat chicken, or two pounds 
of fresh, fat veal or lamb, and put it on the 
fire with about a pound of good fat bacon 
in plenty of water. Put it on about four 
hours before dinner. After it has boiled 
between two and three hours, put in three 
quarts of fine sliced okra, a quart of peeled 
tomatoes, and four carrots sliced very fine. 
About twenty minutes before serving up the 
soup, cut up and put in two large onions, 

{t9) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

a very little thickening, salt and red pepper 
to the taste. It takes two large pods of red 
pepper to make the soup hot. This will 
make four quarts of very fine soup. Some 
persons prefer this soup without the toma- 
toes and carrots. 

^^ ^fr ^^ 

OKRA GUMBO. 

Take a chicken, cut it into pieces, dust 
them with flour, put a large spoonful of 
good butter in a frying pan with a slice of 
good ham, put in the chicken and let it fry 
to a light brown. Add the okra and let it 
fry a short time (the okra is cut in slices 
a quarter of an inch thick), then put in 
enough warm water to make two quarts of 
soup, a large silver onion chopped fine and 
fried. Let it boil until a few minutes before 
dinner, then thicken with browned flour and 
season with salt and red and black pepper. 

OYSTER. 

Wash the oysters well, first in the liquor, 
then in a little water; add the water to the 

{20) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

liquor, strain it through a cloth, and pour 
it back on the oysters. Put the oysters over 
the fire and let them stew five minutes, then 
put into two quarts of oysters, one quart 
of milk, six ounces of butter, and a large 
slice of loaf bread cut in little squares. Sea- 
son with salt and black pepper and let all 
stew twenty minutes from the time you put 
them on the fire. You may leave out the 
slice of loaf bread. 

If you like the soup rich, you must put 
in more than six ounces of butter. If you 
get good, living oysters they may be kept 
in a cellar four or five weeks and fatten. 
Place the oysters with their mouths or shells 
up, and feed once a day with water made 
slightly brackish or water to whiqh a little 
meal has been added. 

OYSTER GUMBO. 

Take one chicken, one pound of lean beef» 
and a slice of fat ham, cut them into pieces, 
dust them with flour, and fry a light brown 

i2t) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

with some good» fresh butter. Then pour 
on sufficient warm water to make about two 
quarts of soup. Add a large silver onion 
(some fry the onion). Let all boil until half 
an hour before dinner, then add from a 
quart to half a gallon of oysters well drained, 
some thyme and parsley tied in a bunch, 
and season with black pepper and salt. Just 
before you pour it into the tureen, after it 
is off of the fire, sprinkle in the fillet until 
it is as thick as you like, stirring it well. 
The above will make from three to four 
quarts of soup. 

9 99 

SALSIFY. 

Scrape the salsify and wash it, boil it until 
it is nearly done, then cut it into very thin 
slices and put it back in the water in which 
it was boiled. Take about three-quarters 
of a quart of this sliced salsify, a pint of 
cream, a large slice of butter, a little thick- 
ening, and season with salt and pepper. The 
soup is nicer if about half of the salsify is 
mashed up. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

TOMATO. 

Take a good large chicken, put it in suf- 
ficient water to make two quarts of soup; 
after it has boiled about an hour put in two 

ft 

dozen large tomatoes, and let them boil about 
fifteen minutes before serving up the soup. 
Strain the soup through a colander and put 
in a pint of cream, a large spoonful of butter, 
two of brown sugar, a little thickening, two 
onions chopped very fine, and salt and black 
pepper to the taste. Toast some bread nicely, 
cut it into small pieces, and put it in the 
tureen, pour the soup over it, and serve 
it up. 

TURKEY AND CHICKEN. 

Turkey soup may be made from the bones 
of a cold roast turkey with the addition of 
about half a pound of nice fat bacon, but 
the nicest soup is made from the water in 
which a turkey is boiled. After the turkey 
is cooked sufficiently, take it out and skim 
off the oily particles to dress the turkey 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

with — they spoil the soup if allowed to re- 
main. Then add a little thickening, salt, 
and half a pint of rich milk. Some persons 
like rice in this soup, in which case the rice 
must be boiled in the soup before the turkey 
is taken out. If the turkey is not very fat 
put half a pound of good fat bacon on with 
the turkey, to make the soup rich enough. 
Two quarts of very fine soup can be made 
from a boiled turkey. 

Chicken soup is sometimes made from the 
water in which half-grown chickens are 
boiled, but the usual and best way is to take 
a large fat chicken and put it on in water 
sufficient to cover about two hours before 
dinner. You may put in a little rice if you 
choose. About fifteen or twenty minutes 
before serving up the soup put in a bunch 
of thyme to season it. Ten minutes before 
it is done add about a pint of rich cream, 
a little thickening, and season with salt and 
black pepper. The above will make two 
quarts of rich chicken soup.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

VEGETABLE. 

Take a slice of good fat ham and put it 
on to boil in water with some tender cym- 
blings and ears of com, enough to make 
two quarts of soup; the quantity will de- 
pend upon the size of the cymblings and 
how thick you like the soup. When the 
cymblings are done pass them through a 
sieve and return them into the pot in which 
they were boiled with the ham, cut off the 
com carefully and put back with the cym- 
blings, etc. The com may be cut off the 
cob before it is boiled and put in the soup. 
Put a little thickening in the soup, a pint 
of cream, a slice of butter, and season with 
salt and black pepper. This is for two 
quarts of soup. Four good ears of com and 
three cymblings would be quite sufficient 
for this quantity of soup. 

VERMICELLI. 

Take a large fat chicken, or about two 
pounds of veal or lamb, and two or three 

{25) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

slices of fat ham ; the chicken should be cut 
in pieces, the lamb or veal in small slices, 
and put on to boil in sufficient cold water; 
let it boil until the meat is boiled to shreds. 
About hair an hour before the soup is done, 
wash well in cold water one and a half or 
two ounces of vermicelli, and put it in the 
soup with some thyme tied in a bunch. 
Season with salt and black pepper. You 
do not put any thickening in this soup. The 
above will make two quarts of rich soup. 
Color the soup a rich brown with burnt 
sugar.

FISH 






FISH 

HERRING, HOW TO PUT UP. 

Cleanse the herrings properly, — if they 
have any mud on them they must be washed, 
»-and then souse them, that is, pack them 
lightly in salt for three or four days. They 
must be pressed down by heavy weights to 
keep them under the brine, which is formed 
by the juice of the herrings and salt. At the 
end of three or, at the most, four days, take 
the herrings out and pack them in Turk 
Island salt, or a mixture of ground alum 
salt pounded and Liverpool salt. Pack them 
closely in oak or cypress barrels, — oak is 
perhaps the best. A molasses barrel is very 
good for packing in. The herrings in pack- 
ing are always placed on the back; pack 
the first row from left to right, the next 
row pack from you so as to make the her- 
rings cross each other at right angles, and 

{29) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

continue so throughout the barrel. After 
the barrels are packed full, take half a pound 
of pounded saltpetre and mix with three 
quarts or a gallon of molasses; pour this 
qusuitity over a barrel of fish and then head 
up the barrel. Before the barrel is headed 
put a proper weight on the herrings, bore 
a hole in the top of the barrel and pour in 
some strong brine. It is necessary that the 
fish should be covered by brine ; if they are 
not they will not be good. A full gallon 
of molasses is more than enough for a barrel 
of herrings. Soak the herrings in cold water 
two or three hours and then hang them up, 
letting them dry perfectly before boiling. 

OYSTER PIE. 

To make an oyster pie, take two quarts 
of oysters, put them on the fire with six 
ounces of butter, and let them stay just long 
enough to melt the butter, season with salt 
and black pepper, and add half a pint of 
milk or cream and a large slice of loaf bread 

(.20) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cut into small pieces. Have a dish prepared 
with paste around the sides, pour in the 
oysters, and bake. 

OYSTERS, FRIED. 

To fry oysters, after the oysters have been 
washed and the liquor strained, — without 
any water being put in it, — make a batter 
of flour, eggs, and some of the oyster liquor, 
put in enough salt and black pepper to sea- 
son the oysters, dip the oysters separately 
into the batter, and then put them into the 
frying-pan, which should be of the right 
heat with plenty of good lard in it. 

OYSTERS, SCALLOPED. 

To scallop oysters, after they have been 
washed, etc., put each large oyster in a shell 
with some crumbled roll, a little salt, black 
pepper, and butter, and bake them in an 
oven. Put a little oyster liquor in each shell. 
Oysters may be boiled and toasted.

OYSTERS, STEWED. 

Wash the oysters carefully in the liquor, 
then wash them in a little water; take the 
oysters out, add the water to the liquor, 
strain the whole through a thin cloth, and 
pour back on the oysters. Put them on the 
fire in an iron pot or vessel, and let them 
stew for fifteen or twenty minutes; if you 
like them cooked it takes twenty minutes. 
To one gallon of oysters put three-quarters 
of a pound of good butter and about one 
pint of milk or cream and season with salt 
and black pepper. Some persons think it 
better not to put the butter in until five 
minutes before serving up the oysters. 

STURGEON. 

Wash and cleanse the sturgeon properly, 
then parboil it and set it in a dish on the 
ice to use as you want it. If it is to be 
fried, cut it in slices about an inch thick; 
dip the slices in flour, put in salt and black 
pepper, and lay them in the frying-pan, 

(52) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

. which should be of the proper heat, with 
some good lard in it for frying. When 
nearly done, put in a little flour; as soon 
as it is brown, add a little water for gravy. 
If the sturgeon is to be baked, rub a little 
salt on it and put it in an oven with some 
water; a piece of sturgeon four inches thick 
is a nice size for baking. When the stur- 
geon is about half done, sprinkle floiu: all 
over it and add a large slice of butter; when 
it is nearly done mix a little flour in a batter 
and stir it in the water and essence in which 
the sturgeon is baking to make the gravy, 
and put a sufiicient seasoning of black pepper 
on the sturgeon. When the gravy is done, 
serve it up.

MEATS 



MEATS 

BAKED VEAL, LAMB, 

MUTTON, CHICKEN. 

Have the meats properly cleansed, wash 
them, rub salt on them, and put them in the 
oven with sufficient water, — say about three 
pints of water to a hind quarter of veal, a 
quart to a quarter of lamb or shoulder of 
mutton, less to chickens or ducks. The 
length of time it takes to bake a hind quar- 
ter of lamb of about ten pounds' weight is 
about two hours; veal of about ten pounds' 
weight, about two hours and a half; an or- 
dinary sized shoulder of mutton takes about 
an hour and a half; ducks require about 
the same time; tender chickens will bake 
in half an hour. When chickens or ducks 
are baked, first see that they are prop- 
erly cleansed, then stuff them with stale 
loaf bread mixed with butter and highly 

(37) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

seasoned with salt and black pepper. Ducks 
are sometimes seasoned with onions. When 
any of these meats are nearly done sprinkle 
a little flour on them, so as to have them 
a nice brown. Chicken and veal, unless they 
are very fat, require something to dress 
them with. Good sweet lard answers bet- 
ter for the veal than butter. The chickens 
require either butter or good fat bacon. 

About ten minutes before the meat is 
done, make up some batter and stir it in 
the water and juice in which the meat is 
baking, season the gravy with salt and black 
pepper, and also sprinkle black pepper on 
the meat. Veal and chicken require more 
than any other meat. Ducks and chickens 
should be killed the day before they are to 
be cooked. First pick off the feathers and 
cleanse them, then put them in salt water 
an hour or two, then put them in a dish 
and set them on ice until you are ready to 
use them. All kinds of fowls should be 
well done; it is better to have them rather 
overdone than underdone. Veal should be 

(38) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cooked in the same manner. To frost veal 
or lamb mix flour and butter together and 
put over the meat just before sprinkling on 
flour. 

BLACK STEW. 

Take eight or nine slices from a cold 
roasted saddle or loin of mutton. Put plenty 
of the cold gravy with it. Set on the fire in 
a skillet or in the oven with water enough 
to cover it well, about an hour and a half 
before dinner. About fifteen minutes be- 
fore dinner chop up and put in two silver 
onions of the usual size, one rounding table- 
spoonful of fine pounded allspice, enough to 
make the stew black, a little thickening, and 
season with sedt and black pepper. Five 
minutes before serving up the stew, slice 
and put in a large pickled cucumber. Take 
out the slices of meat, lay them in a dish, 
and stir in the gravy a gill of currant jelly. 
Pour the gravy over the meat and serve 
it up.

BRAINS. 

Wash the brains well, and let them stand 
an hour in salt and water, then parboil them 
in water with a little salt in it. Beat two 
eggs well and add them to the brains of 
sixteen hogs, also beating in with the eggs 
about hcdf a pint of flour or a little more, 
not less. After beating in the eggs and flour, 
season with salt and black pepper. Have 
a frying-pan with plenty of good sweet 
lard in it, drop in the batter by spoonfuls, 
fry to a light brown on one side, then turn 
and fry on the other. Half a pound of lard 
is an abundance to fry the above quantity 
of brains. There is a thin skin over tlie 
brains which should be taken off before they 
are boiled or, more properly, parboiled. 

CHICKEN, FRIAR'S. 

Take a full-grown fowl, — an old hen will 
do very well. After it has been properly 
cleaned and put in salt water for two or 
three hours and kept on ice for two or three 

{40) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

days, cut it into pieces, separating every 
limb, that is, cut the legs in two and the 
wings in three pieces, and separate the 
breast and side bones, etc. Put it into a 
suitable vessel with two quarts of water, 
cover it over, and let it boil for four hours. 
Add a little thickening, half a pint of rich 
milk, and season with salt and black pepper. 
If the fowl is poor stir a slice of butter and 
two eggs well beaten into the milk before 
that is put in. Thyme makes a good sea- 
soning for this dish. It is an improvement 
to bake this. 

CHICKEN, FRICASSEED. 

Take two well-grown, fat chickens that 
have been picked and cleaned, separate the 
wings, legs, breasts, etc., and lay them in 
salt and water for an hour or two. They 
may be cooked at once, but will be better 
if kept for twenty-four hours in a dish with 
a little salt sprinkled on them. When ready 
to cook them, wash them, dust them with 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

flour, and sprinkle a little salt on them ; put 
them in the oven with a quarter of a pound 
of good lard, let them fry until each piece 
is well browned ; then add a quart of water, 
cover it over and let it stew. About twenty 
minutes before the chicken is done cut up 
a large silver onion and put it in the gravy. 
Five or six minutes before serving up the 
chicken, make the yolks of two eggs into 
a batter and stir in the gravy, seasoning with 
black pepper. When the chicken is done 
lay it in a dish and stir in the gravy the 
whites of two eggs; this will cook in a 
moment. Pour the gravy on the chicken 
and serve it up. 

CHICKEN, FRIED. 

Prepare the chicken for frying in the same 
manner as for a fricassee, taking out the 
breast bone, which should be done also with 
the fricasseed chicken. Put four ounces of 
lard in a frying-pan of the right heat; dust 
the chicken with flour, and rub a little salt 

{42) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

on it. Put it in the pan and let it fry until 
it is a light brown. Have a half-pint of 
sifted meal made into a stiff mush, let it 
get entirely cold, cut it into cakes, and fry 
it a light brown. Also fry a little parsley 
into the chicken. 

CORNED BEEF. 

Cut up the beef about twelve hours after 
it has been killed, throw the pieces you wish 
corned into cold water, and let them remain 
for an hour or two. After dripping, rub it 
a little with salt, and then put it in the 
brine. The brine is made of Liverpool salt 
strong enough to bear an egg. Rub a tea- 
spoonful of saltpetre on every piece of beef 
except the tongue and the rounds, which 
should have double that quantity; the 
tongue should have only half a teaspoonful. 
The beef should always be entirely covered 
by the brine. It is generally necessary to 
put heavy stones on it to keep it under the 
brine. If you wish to keep corned beef for 

{43) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

spring use, take it out of the brine after it 
has been in for about four weeks and hang 
it up in the meat house to smoke. It gives 
the beef a good flavor to put some sugar in 
the brine, say two pounds of brown sugar 
to eight gallons of brine. Five teaspoon- 
fuls of saltpetre is equal to one ounce. 

FOWLS, BOILED WITH RICE. 

Take pullets or full-grown fowls that have 
been properly cleaned and stuffed and put 
them on to boil in boiling water, the length 
of time depending on the tenderness of the 
fowls, varying from three-quarters of an 
hour to two hours and a half. For two full- 
grown fowls take half a pound of rice, wash 
and boil it as for a vegetable soup. When 
it is done season it with salt and mix up 
a tablespoonful of flour with some cold water 
to make a thin batter, stir it in the rice, and 
let it stay on the fire until the batter is 
done, then stir in a large slice of butter. 

{44) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Put the fowls in a dish, cover them with / 

the rice, and serve them up. 

FRENCH BEEFSTEAK. 

To prepare French beefsteak cut slices 
about an inch thick of uncooked beef from 
the steak part, dust them with flour, and 
sprinkle salt on them. Put them in an oven 
to fry with some shredded suet about five 
hours before dinner. After frying on both 
sides put in water enough to cover the meat 
well. Let it stew until dinner. About 
three-quarters of an hour before dinner put 
in some small silver onions and tolerably 
large potatoes; cook them until they are 
done. Ten minutes before serving up the 
steak put in some thickening and season 
with salt and black pepper. 

HAM, BOILED AND BAKED. 

The length of time for boiling a ham de- 
pends upon the size and age of the ham. A 

(^5) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

ham of the usual size, say eleven or twelve 
pounds, and one that is only three or four 
months old, requires to be boiled about four 
hours. One a year old or more is boiled 
in about two and a half hours. An old ham 
should always be soaked in cold water five 
or six hours before boiling. Skim off the 
froth that rises to the top of the pot. A 
baked ham should never be more than six 
months old. After washing it properly boil 
it until it is half done, then lift it out of 
the pot, take off the skin, and put it in the 
oven to bake with sufficient water, — about 
a quart. Take some stale rolls or loaf bread 
and crumble them; when the crumbs are 
put on, sprinkle the ham with flour and some 
black pepper ; moisten the bread with a little 
of the water in which the bacon has been 
boiled, and when the ham is nearly done 
cover it over with the bread thus prepared. 
The ham should be baked until it is tender. 
It is best served up cold.

LAMB, BOILED. 

Take a fat hind quarter of lamb, wash it 
well, rub it with salt, and put it on to boil 
in a covered vessel in as much water as 
will cover it. It takes about two hours to 
boil a quarter weighing about ten pounds. 
Skim off the froth that rises to the top in 
boiling. When the lamb is nearly done, 
make a thick paste, season it with salt and 
stir in four ounces of butter and some pars- 
ley. This makes the gravy for the lamb. 
It may be seasoned with pickled cucumbers 
cut up in slices and stewed for a minute or 
two in the gravy, or with capers, leaving 
out the parsley. Put the lamb in a dish, 
pour the gravy over it, and cover. A leg 
of mutton may be dressed in the same 
manner. 

PORK A LA MODE. 

Take some good fat pork steaks, rub a 
little flour on them. Put them in an oven 
and let them fry on each side until they are 

{47) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about half done ; then pour on enough water 
to cover them and let them stew. Put in 
a fine chopped onion for seasoning. About 
five minutes before serving up the dish sea- 
son with salt and black pepper and put in 
some thickening; then add an equal quan- 
tity of vinegar and sugar, enough to flavor 
the dish well, and just enough fine pounded 
allspice to make the stew black. The meat 
must be stewed until it is as tender as 
chicken. 

ROASTED MUTTON, BEEF, 

LAMB, TURKEY. 

The time for roasting a sirloin of beef, or 
a turkey of the ordinary size, is about two 
hours; a saddle of mutton from two to. two 
and a half hours; a quarter of lamb from 
two and a half to three hours. The longer 
a saddle of mutton can be kept perfectly 
sweet, from the time it is butchered until 
it is cooked, the finer flavored and more ten- 
der it becomes. Wrapped in a linen cloth and 

(.48) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

laid on the ice, it can be kept upwards of 
four weeks. Beef is also more tender after 
it has been kept a while buried in the ice. 
Before cooking the meats wash them well, 
and rub salt on them. Suspend by a cord 
fastened to the spit and then secured in a 
hook over the fireplace before a large fire, 
and turn the meat every minute or two. Put 
a dripping-pan underneath to catch the juice 
of the meat. About fifteen minutes before 
the meats are done, take the juice from the 
dripping-pan, put it in a skillet (if the 
dripping-pan is very hot, put in a little 
water to prevent the juice from burning), 
mix some flour in a very thin batter, and 
stir it in the gravy to thicken it. Let it 
stew until the meat is done. Ten minutes 
before serving up the meat sprinkle a little 
flour on it and turn constantly, so as to 
have it a light brown. The turkey should 
not have any flour sprinkled on it. If the- 
turkey is poor, baste it with a little butter 
or a few thin slices of fat bacon; stuff the 
turkey with stale bread mixed with butter, 

^49) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

salt, and pepper. Tie the wings close to its 
side. 

SPICED ROUND OF BEEF. 

Take one ounce of black pepper, half an 
ounce of cloves, the same of allspice, pound 
these spices, add one grated nutmeg, one 
oimce of saltpetre, and two handfuls of salt. 
Rub the beef with about half a pint of mo- 
lasses, then with the spices, salt, etc. Put 
it in an earthen dish and rub it with the 
hand every morning and turn it. It may 
be cooked in a fortnight or it may be kept 
six weeks. Stew or bake it in an oven or 
a pot with beef suet shredded fine over it. 
Add a quart of water and a pint of port or 
claret wine. It must be done slowly, taking 
care to keep all the steam in. It will re- 
quire three or four hours to get it perfectly 
done, or perhaps five hours, according to 
the size of the round.

TRIPE. 

After the tripe has been well washed, it 
is put in hot water and scraped until all the 
coarse, hard substance which adheres to it 
is taken off. Soak it in cold water for ten 
or twelve hours ; then scrape it again, wash 
it well, and put it in weak salt water. Let 
it remain in salt water four days, changing 
the water every day; then boil it. After it 
is boiled put it in salt water to remain as 
long as it is desired to keep it. The length 
of time it may be kept depends upon the 
coldness of the weather. When you wish 
to serve it up, if it is to be stewed, put it 
on with water enough to cover it, in slices 
about three inches square, and let it stew 
until it is perfectly tender. Add a little 
thickening and salt and half a pint of milk 
or cream to a dish of the usual size. To 
prepare onion sauce for this dish, cut up 
some silver onions and put them on the fire 
in a saucepan with a little water, then add 
a spoonful of flour, enough to make a thin 
batter, season with salt, and put in a large 

(5/) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

slice of butter just before serving up the 
sauce. If you like the tripe fried, cut it 
in slices as you do for stewing, dip the slices 
in a batter made of eggs, flour, and water 
or milk and put them in a frying-pan, which 
should be properly heated and have sufE-, 
cient lard in it. The thickest parts of the 
tripe are the best. 

TURKEY, BOILED. 

Put an old turkey hen on to boil about 
two hours, not longer, before dinner, in as 
much water as will cover it. Tie the wings 
to the sides. As the water boils down, 
leaving the turkey uncovered, it must be 
turned occasionally, so that each part of 
it may be equally done. Salt to season. 
About ten or fifteen minutes before the tur- 
key is done, take half a dozen hard-boiled 
eggs, cut them up fine, put them in a skillet 
with a pint of cold water, put the skillet 
on the fire, and let the eggs and water stew 
thoroughly ; stir in about a gill of flour with 

(52) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

the eggs and water before you put them 
over the fire instead of afterward. Season 
with salt, skim off the oily particles that 
rise to the surface of the water in which 
the turkey has been boiled, and put with 
the egg sauce, and just before taking the 
sauce off the fire stir in a large slice of 
butter. Dress the turkey with the sauce 
and serve it up. The turkey is prepared 
for boiling or roasting by being first well 
washed, then stuffed with stale loaf bread 
mixed with butter and highly seasoned with 
black pepper and salt. The wings should 
be tied close to the sides with a strong 
string. Pullets and hens are boiled and 
dressed with egg sauce in the same manner. 
A young turkey takes barely an hour to 
boil; hens only are boiled. 

VEAL'S HEAD. 

Dip the head in hot water, and scrape it 
until every hair is taken off, then put it on 
to boil in water sufficient to cover it. When 
it is parboiled take it off the fire, take out 

(.53) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

every bone, and the hard whitish substance 
inside the mouth. It may be kept in a cov- 
ered vessel on the ice for several days in 
the liquor in which it was boiled; when it 
is to be served up put it on the fire and let 
it boil until it is perfectly done, and the 
liquor in which it was first boiled is brought 
down to a proper consistency. Put in a 
little thickening, four ounces of butter, and 
season with salt and pepper. The ears and 
eyes are left whole, the tongue is sliced. 
Take out the brains before you stew the 
head a second time, and make them, with 
bread, butter, salt, pepper, and thyme, into 
little balls and fry them. Also fry little 
pieces of pastry cut into shapes and put 
them on top of the head after it is baked. 
When the head has been seasoned put it into 
a deep dish with a nice paste around the edge, 
and bake it. When it is done put the little 
pieces of fried pastry and forced meat balls 
on top of the dish and serve it up. Some 
persons dress the head with hard-boiled eggs.

VEGETABLES 



VEGETABLES 

BEETS. 

Wash the beets well and put them on in 
cold water. When they are done pour them 
into a colander to drain off the water; then 
take off the skins and serve them up whole, 
or sliced, with an abundance of butter over 
them. To scrape the skins off beets before 
boiling, as with salsify and parsnips, spoil 
them, as they are more tender than those 
vegetables. 

CABBAGE PUDDING. 

Get a large, well-flowered head of cabbage. 
Take off the outer leaves ; cut out the inner 
top part, take about half a pound of fat 
bacon boiled, the same of fresh beef or 
mutton cooked, cut them into little pieces, 
crumble up a large slice of loaf bread, and 
mix it with the meat, add a slice of butter, 

(57) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and a good deal of salt and black pepper. 
Stuff the cabbage with the meat, bread, and 
cabbage that has been taken out of the top, 
lay a leaf of cabbage over the stuffed part, 
tie it up in a cloth, and boil it for four 
hours. When the cabbage is served up cover 
it with drawn butter. 

To make drawn butter, mix a rather thick 
paste, and to every gill of paste stir in while 
it is hot five or six ounces of good fresh 
butter. Put on in boiling water. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Take a dozen large ears of tender green 
corn, cut the kernels off the cob, taking care 
first to pull out all the silk and to lose 
none of the juice or milk of the com. Beat 
up six eggs and add them to the com, sea- 
son with salt and black pepper, and then 
drop in spoonfuls into a frying-pan and fry 
on one side, then turn and fry on the other.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

CORN PUDDING. 

Boil a dozen ears of com until they are 
half done; then cut the corn from the cob, 
taking care not to let any of the husk be 
mixed with it. To this quantity of corn put 
a quart of rich cream, six or eight ounces 
of butter, and season with salt and black 
pepper. It is well to beat the corn in a 
wooden tray with a wooden beater. The 
butter and cream are put in and well mixed 
with the com, and the whole then put in 
a dish and baked. Some cooks put eggs in 
their pudding, say four eggs to one dozen 
ears of corn. Some think it best not to boil 
the com for this pudding. 

CUCUMBERS, STEWED. 

Peel the cucumbers, cut them up, and put 
them in a skillet in sufficient water to cover 
them. Cut up a silver onion and add for 
seasoning. When they are done mash them 
up, season with salt and black pepper, and 

(5^) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

add a slice of butter. They are about the 
consistency of cymblings. 

CYMBLINGS. 

First boil the cymblings until they are 
done, then mash them and pass them 
through a sieve; put them in a skillet with 
a pint of cream to about a quart of cym- 
blings, season with salt and black pepper, 
and let them stew until the cymblings are 
dry enough, say for about ten minutes. Stir 
in a large slice of butter and serve them 
up. 

EGG-PLANT. 

Boil the egg-plant until it is done, or soft 
enough to mash it to a pulp; then take off 
the skin, mash it, season with salt and 
pepper, and make it into cakes about half 
an inch thick. Make a batter of two eggs, 
flour, and a little milk, dip the cakes in it, 
and put them \xi a frying-pan, which should 
be of the right heat, with plenty of lard in 

{60) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

it. Fry them to a light brown on one side, 
then turn and fry to a brown on the other. 

To bake egg-plant, after boiling and mash- 
ing it season with ssdt and black pepper and 
stir in a little cream and a good slice of 
butter in a dish of an ordinary size, also 
some grated stale bread. Cut it in slices a 
third of an inch thick, grate a little stale 
bread over them, season with salt and pep- 
per, and fry them. 

EGGS A LA CREAM. 

Rub a little flour and fresh butter together, 
add a little salt and pepper and one pint 
of cream, and one fried onion and parsley, 
cut up and stewed together two or three 
minutes. Take twelve hard-boiled eggs and 
cut in slices ; grate some stale bread, a little 
over a pint when grated ; put in a deep disH, 
taking a layer of crumbs and a layer of eggs 
until all are in the dish, a layer of crumbs 
on the top; season with pepper and salt; 
pour in on each layer the stewed cream; 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

bake in the oven with a quick heat until 
a light brown. 

HOMINY, BOILED. 

Take two quarts of hominy and pour on 
it four quarts of cold water the night before 
you intend boiling it, and let it soak until 
the next morning; or put it in soak six or 
eight hours before boiling it. Put it on to 
boil in an iron pot in the same water in 
which it has been soaked, adding eight 
quarts of cold water. When it commences 
to boil, or after it has boiled a few minutes, 
skim off the foam that rises to the top. Let 
the hominy boil for three and a half hours 
in a covered vessel. If it boils over and it 
should be necessary to add more water, the 
water that is added must be boiling. The 

' above quantity of water is sufiicient for boil- 
ing the hominy unless it boils over or the 
pot is left uncovered. It must not be al- 
lowed to stop boiling for one moment, or 
it will take longer than three hours and a 

(62) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

half; when the hominy is done it is almost 
dry. It should be taken out of the pot and 
beaten in a wooden tray with a strong 
wooden beater. It may be served up hot 
with an abundance of butter, or it may be 
put away to get cold for frying. When it 
is to be fried put it in an iron vessel and 
make hot; put in a slice of butter and salt 
sufficient to season; have a frying-pan 
heated with a sufficient quantity of lard in 
it, put in the hominy and fry to a light 
brown. Boiled hominy should be kept in 
a cool place. It will keep for four or five 
days in cool weather. Before the hominy 
is put to soak preparatory to boiling, it 
must be well washed in cold water. If al- 
lowed to stand for a few minutes in the 
water in which it is washed, the impurities 
will rise to the top, and may be easily 
poured off with the water. If the hominy 
is rather too stiff or dry, when you fry it 
put in some cream instead of butter. Cream 
put in the boiled hominy with the butter 
is very good.

MACARONI. 

Take half a pound of macaroni and soak 
it in cold water for hadf an hour. Boil it 
for about an hour, not longer. Then spread 
layers of macaroni in the dish with butter 
and grated cheese between. Also put in a 
little mustard and season highly with salt 
and black pepper. Put half a pound of 
cheese and six ounces of butter to half a 
pound of macaroni. Bake for about half 
an hour. Macaroni may be boiled in milk 
and served up without baking. 

MUSHROOMS. 

Take the fresh-gathered mushrooms, re- 
move the stems, and peel off the top skin. 
Wash them and put them on to stew in a 
stewpan either brass- or porcelain-lined. 
Put very little water with them; let them 
stew for an hour or until they are entirely 
done, season with salt and black pepper, 
and put in plenty of butter. Another way 
of cooking mushrooms is to broil them. For 

{64) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

this purpose select the largest, peel them 
and take off the stem, put salt and pepper 
on them, and dip them in melted butter. 
Take them off the gridiron once or twice 
while they are broiling and dip them in 
butter. Take a silver spoon and stir up the 
mushrooms; if there is one amongst them 
that is not good, it will turn the spoon 
dark. 

ONIONS, STEWED. 

Peel the onions (the silver onion is the 
best for every purpose), chop them up and 
put them in the skillet with nearly a quart 
of water to a quart of chopped onions ; stew 
them in a covered vessel for about half an 
hour or until they are done. When they are 
half done stir in a teaspoonful of flour and 
one of sugar and season with salt, and just 
before serving them up add a large slice of 
butter.

POTATOES, BOILED. 

The most wholesome and most palatable 
way of cooking Irish potatoes is to boil 
them. The proper mode of boiling them, 
and the exact length of time it takes to cook 
them sufficiently, cannot be well known but 
by practice, though some general directions 
may be given. The potatoes just dug re- 
quire a shorter time for boiling than those 
which have been out of the ground for sev- 
eral weeks. Large potatoes, of course, take 
a rather longer time for boiling than small 
ones. Take some potatoes that have been 
out of the ground for several weeks, choose 
them of the same size, say such as will 
weigh six ounces, put them in a pot of cold 
water with a tablespoonful of salt for a 
dozen potatoes, and boil them from twenty- 
five minutes to half an hour. Then pour 
the potatoes into a colander so as to drain 
off every drop of water, return the water 
to the pot in which the potatoes were boiled 
and set the colander with the potatoes over 
it; set them on the fire and let the potatoes 

{66) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

steam for one or two minutes, then skin 
them, put them in a heated dish, cover them 
over and serve them up immediately. In 
putting the potatoes on to boil always have 
water enough to allow for evaporation and 
yet to leave enough to cover the potatoes 
until they are done. When the potatoes are 
small and indifferent mash them and beat 
them up with half a pint of cream to a dish 
of the ordinary size, that is, to between two 
and three pounds of potatoes. They are 
very good baked after being mashed and the 
cream put in them. Fried potatoes may 
have milk put in them, but much less of 
it. Make them into cakes about an inch 
thick. Summer potatoes, just dug out of 
the ground, may be boiled in twenty min- 
utes' time. Mashed, fried, and baked pota- 
toes are always seasoned with salt. 

RICE, BOILED. 

Take half a pound of rice, wash it well, 
put with it one quart and three-quarters of 

{67) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cold water, and let it soak for two hours; 
then boil it in the same water in which it 
has been soaking. It should be boiled in 
the clearest of vessels; cover the vessel in 
which you cook it and let it boil twenty 
minutes with the cover on, then take off 
the cover and let it simmer until the re- 
maining water is sufficiently evaporated to 
make the rice dry enough; have a dish 
heated by the fire, put in the rice, put on 
two or three ounces of butter, cover the 
dish, and serve it up immediately. If rice 
is boiled in a bag in water all the nutritous 
part of the rice is boiled out, and nothing 
but dry, tasteless grains remain. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

Boil the rice in the usual manner. When 
it is cold make it into cakes the size of a 
beaten biscuit, or rather more than half an 
inch thick. Have a thin batter of flour and 
milk or flour and egg; dip the cakes in it 
and put them in a frying-pan of the proper 

{68) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

heat with sufficient sweet lard; fry them 
to a crisp brown on one side, then turn and 
fry on the other. Rice may be mixed with 
the eggs well beaten and stirred up with 
the rice so as to make all a light yellow, 
and fried in cakes without any batter. 

SALSIFY, FRIED AND STEWED. 

Scrape the salsify until all the peeling or 
outer covering is taken off, then boil it in 
water until it is soft. Take it out of the 
water, cut it up and wash it. If it is to 
be stewed, put it on in a skillet with a pint 
of milk to a quart of salsify, and let it stew 
about fifteen minutes; season with salt and 
black pepper, and after taking it off the fire 
put in a large slice of butter. If the salsify 
is to be fried, mash it after it is sufficiently 
boiled, season with salt and pepper, and 
make it into little cakes. Have a batter of 
flour, milk, and two eggs for a quart of 
salisfy; dip the cakes into it, and fry them. 
Salsify should be boiled immediately after 

{69) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

it is washed and scraped. It is put on to 
boil in boiling water. 

TOMATOES, DRESSED. 

Peel the tomatoes and cut them in two 
or three pieces. The large cherry tomato 
is the best kind for every purpose. To one 
quart of peeled and cut tomatoes put a gill 
or, if you like them wet, a gill and a half 
of brown sugar, and two rolls cnunbled to 
pieces and seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Let them stew for about an hour, and when 
they are served up stir in a large spoonful 
of batter. If you like the tomatoes baked, 
put thin slices of buttered bread in a dish 
with layers of tomatoes, alternately, the same 
proportion of sugar that you put to stewed 
tomatoes, and bake them. To dress the 
raw tomatoes take two dozen perfectly ripe 
cherry tomatoes of even size, peel them, 
and cut them into thin slices. To this quan- 
tity put one and a half gills of brown sugar 
and the same quantity of good vinegar, and 

(70) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

season highly with salt and black pepper. 
Spread a layjtv of tomatoes, then put on 
some of the vinegar and sugar, salt and 
pepper, and continue in this manner until 
all are in the dish. Some add mustard and 
sweet oil to tomatoes dressed in this man- 
ner, which makes a good sauce.

SALADS 



SALADS 

CHICKEN. 

Take the breast, short legs, side bones, 
and wings — leaving out the pinions — of 
three large chickens or pullets, or a good- 
sized turkey, after they have become cold; 
take off the skin and fat and cut up the 
meat into very small pieces. Cut up celery 
into pieces a quarter of an inch thick, tak- 
ing care not to bruise it; put about one 
quart of celery sliced to this quantity of 
chicken or turkey. Mix three heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of English mustard with a little 
water, and let it stand a while. Boil four 
eggs very hard, mash up the yolks and mix 
them with half a gill of good cider vinegar, 
a gill of sweet oil, the mustard, salt enough 
for the whole salad, the whites of the eggs 
cut up, and three pickled cucumbers cut 
into little pieces; mix this seasoning with 
the meat and then put in the celery. Should 
this not taste enough of the pickle, add a 

{75) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

little more vinegar or another cucumber. 
The salad should be made and put into a 
covered dish some hours before it is wanted. 

COLD SLAW. 

Cut up the cabbage, or rather shred it, in 
the usual manner ; take half a pint of cream 
and half a pint of red pepper vinegar; beat 
three eggs well and stir into the vinegar, 
also two heaping teaspoonfuls of English 
mustard, a sufficient seasoning of salt, a 
slice of fresh butter, and two gills of yellow 
sugar; put the whole on the fire and let 
it boil up until the cream thickens a little, 
— it must not form curds and whey. Then 
take it off, and as soon as it becomes per- 
fectly cold pour it over the cabbage. Some 
celery cut up and put with the cabbage is 
a great improvement to the slaw. 

HOT SLAW. 

To one quart of fine shredded cabbage 
put half a pint of boiling water and two 

(.76) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

teaspoonfuls of flour; boil it for fifteen min- 
utes, then stir in a slice of butter and pepper 
and vinegar or vinegar and mustard; season 
with salt. To this same quantity of cab- 
bage shredded fine and boiled an hour and a 
half put half a pint or more of cream, some 
butter, salt, and pepper, and stew ten minutes. 

VEAL SALAD. 

Take cold baked or roasted veal, cut it 
into very small pieces, take three hard- 
boiled eggs, cut up the whites and mash 
the yolks into a pulp, and mix them with 
half a gill of sweet oil, a gill of vinegar, 
and a large cucumber cut into bits, season 
the veal with salt and black pepper to the 
taste; mix two heaping teaspoonfuls of 
English mustard and sugar in the usual 
manner, add it to the eggs, then mix the 
whole with as much of the veal as it will 
season well. It is best to make this salad 
an hour or two before it is wanted and let 
it stand in a covered dish.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 

APPLE, GERMAN. 

Take good ripe crab apples, peel and 
weigh them; to eight pounds of apples put 
four pounds of brown sugar, one ounce of 
pounded allspice, three-quarters of an ounce 
of pounded cloves and the same of cinna- 
mon (also some mace if you like it), and 
just enough good cider vinegar to cover the 
apples. You may scald the vinegar and 
sugar and pour it hot on the fruit and 
spices, letting them stand twenty-four hours, 
and then boiling them until they are done; 
or you may put the sugar, vinegar, and fruit 
on at once and cook them slowly until the 
apples are soft enough. They must not 
stay long enough to commence falling to 
pieces. Put the spices in about five or six 
minutes before the apples are done. By 
"vinegar enough to cover the apples" is 
meant vinegar with the sugar and juice 

{8t) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

from the apples; there should not be more 
than two quarts of vinegar to eight pounds 
of apples. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Take any quantity of ripe tomatoes you 
choose, stew them for three-quarters of an 
hour, then pass them through a sieve or 
colander. To four quarts of tomatoes put 
one quart of vinegar, one pint of silver 
onions chopped fine, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one and a half ounces of ginger 
pounded, the same of pounded black pepper, 
one ounce of allspice, half a pound of brown 
sugar; season with salt to taste. After it 
becomes cold, bottle it, and seal the bottles. 
The sealing-wax is made of melted rosin 
and pounded brick dust. Keep the bottles 
in a dry cellar. 

CATSUP, WALNUT. 

Use the vinegar in which the walnuts have 
been kept (say one gallon of vinegar). Take 

{82) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

four dozen walnuts and beat them in a 
wooden mortar, then put them in the vine- 
gar and strain the whole through a coarse 
cloth; should the liquor taste too strong 
add a little more vinegar. Put to a gallon 
of the vinegar two tablespoonfuls of ginger, 
the same of black pepper (beaten fine), two 
of allspice (well beaten), a gill of black 
mustard seed (beaten fine), four ounces of 
garlic, half a pound brown sugar, and four 
oimces of rasped horseradish. Mix these 
ingredients well, bottle them, and seal the 
bottles. If the weather is warm, set the 
bottles in the sun for a week or ten days, 
then put them in a dry cellar. Putting the 
bottles in the sun I think may be an advan- 
tage to the catsup; I have never tried it. 

CHERRIES, PICKLED. 

Take perfectly ripe Morilla or cluster 
cherries and cut off half the stems. Take 
a gallon of good cider vinegar and add a 
tablespoonful of mace, one of cloves, and 

i83) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

one of allspice ; pound these spices and mix 
them with the vinegar; also put in a pound 
of brown sugar (if you like it not too acid) ; 
scald the vinegar and pour over the cher- 
ries, and when cold cover the jar close. 
After letting stand for three or four days 
pour off the vinegar and scald it and pour 
it back on the cherries; when they are en- 
tirely cold cover the jar again closely. They 
will be fit for use in a fortnight. I think 
the second scalding unnecessary. 

CHERRIES, GERMAN. 

Take eight pounds of cherries; add to 
them three-quarters of an ounce of cinna- 
mon, the same of cloves, and one ounce of 
allspice (beaten fine); also six pounds of 
sugar and three-quarters of a quart of strong 
vinegar. Stone the cherries, put them on 
with the sugar in a brass skillet, and stew 
them about half an hour, then add the vine- 
gar and spices and let them stew for about 
five minutes longer. Pour into a jar, and 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

as soon as cold cover close. Should the 
cherries not taste sufficiently of vinegar add 
a half pint of vinegar. The cherries should 
be stoned before they are weighed. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERS AND MELONS. 
To one gallon of vinegar put one and a 
half pounds of sugar, three lemons sliced, 
one gill of white must£u:d seed, one ounce 
of ginger, half an ounce of cloves, the same 
of mace, and three-quarters of an ounce of 
allspice. Beat these spices to a coarse pow- 
der, and add two ounces of celery seed 
bruised, two ounces of horseradish scraped 
fine, two ounces and a half of garlic. Mix 
these ingredients in July; put them in a 
jar and cover very close; set them in the 
hot sun every day for a month. Wash your 
cucumbers in cold water, put them in strong 
salt water for two or three weeks, then 
wash them again, green them in the usual 
manner (the greening of pickles and gher* 
kins should always be done in a brass or 

{85) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

porcelain-lined vessel), throw them in cold 
water for a few hours, then put them in 
vinegar for a fortnight. After that put them 
in a jar and pour over them the seasoned 
vinegar. They are ready for use in about 
two months. Soak the cucmnbers in cold 
water for four or five hours before green- 
ing them. 

ANOTHER WAY OF PICKLING 
CUCUMBERS AND GHERKINS. 

Wash the cucumbers and put them in 
strong salt water for two or three weeks, 
then proceed with them as directed above 
for pickling cucumbers. To two gallons of 
vinegar put a pound and a half of brown 
sugar, two ounces of allspice, the same of 
black pepper, four ounces of ginger, two 
of white mustard seed (all pounded), four 
ounces of scraped horseradish, four pods of 
red pepper, and six silver onions. When 
the spices and vinegar are mixed, put them 
in a jar and set the jar in the hot sun every 

{86) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Asiy for a fortnight. Then put the cucum- 
bers in jars, as many in each jar as the 
vinegar will cover, and pour the vinegar 
over them. They will be ready for use in 
about two months. 

DAMSONS, GERMAN. 

Take seven pounds of damsons, wipe 
them dry; take half an ounce of cinnamon, 
the same of cloves, and one oimce of all- 
spice; beat them very fine, add them to 
the damsons; take three pounds of sugar 
and one quart of strong vinegar, put it on 
the fire in a brass skillet, let it commence 
boiling, and immediately pour it on the fruit 
and spices. Cover the jar close and let 
stand twenty-four hours, then put the whole 
on the fire and let it boil seven or eight 
minutes, when it is done. The fruit may 
be used in a few weeks. This pickle may 
also be made by first preserving the dam- 
sons and then adding the vinegar and spices.

GREEN MANGOES. 

Wash the mangoes, put them in salt water 
strong enough to bear an ^gg^ and let them 
remain for three or four weeks; then green 
them with alum and grape leaves; throw 
them into a tub of cold water, and as soon 
as they are cold take out the insides and 
put them in vinegar for a fortnight. The 
vinegar need not be strong. Soak the man- 
goes in cold water five or six hours before 
greening them. For thirty mangoes of the 
usual size, take one pound of white mustard 
seed, the same quantity of black mustard 
seed, one ounce of mace, two ounces of 
celery seed, and a quarter of a pound of 
horseradish scraped fine. After these in- 
gredients have been half pounded and mixed 
with three gills of good sweet oil stuff the 
mangoes. Tie them with a yarn string and 
lay them in jars. Put to this nimiber of 
mangoes a dozen large silver onions peeled. 
Put to the vinegar for this number of 
mangoes (say this amount of seasoning for 
two gallons of vinegar instead of thirty 

(.88) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

mangoes) three pounds of sugar, four ounces 
of horseradish scraped fine» two ounces of 
long pepper (soaked in warm water and 
sliced), two ounces of allspice half pounded, 
and four ounces of celery seed. Stir these 
well together, cover the jars close, and set 
in the hoi sun every day for three or four 
weeks, according to how hot the sun is. 
Cover the jars with bladders and keep 
them close. This pickle is not ready for 
use in less than a year. It should be looked 
at every month or two and more vinegar 
added if necessary. The mangoes should 
be well covered by the vinegar. This pickle 
and all others should be made of good cider 
vinegar. 

GREEN PEPPER. 

Take the sweet pepper as soon as it is 
fully grown and put in strong brine for a 
fortnight; then slit each pepper on one side 
and take out the seeds and put them in 
vinegar and water or weak vinegar for 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

another fortnight. Then stuff them with 
black and white mustard seed (bruised until 
the skin is broken), coriander seed bruised, 
celery seed (beaten fine), and sliced celery 
and sliced cucumbers prepared for pickling. 
Tie them with soft yam string, put them in 
a jar and pour on vinegar. 

GREEN TOMATO. 

Take one peck of green tomatoes, cut them 
in slices, and put them in a jar in layers; 
sprinkle each layer with salt. Also put with 
them twelve large silver onions sliced trans- 
versely. Let them stand twenty-four hours, 
then take them out and let them drain. 
After they have drained add one ounce cori- 
ander seed, three parts red pepper cut into 
small pieces, three lemons sliced, two ounces 
English mustard, five pounds brown sugar, 
four ounces white mustard seed bruised, one 
ounce ginger, one ounce cloves, one ounce 
allspice, one ounce black pepper, and one 
ounce celery seed, all beaten fine. Put the

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

tomatoes and seasoning in layers alternately 
in the skillet; cover with sitrong vinegar 
and simmer briskly imtil the tomatoes are 
clear.

LEMON PICKLE. 

Grate off the yellow rinds of the lemons 
and cut them across each end; pack them 
in a small vessel of dry salt, covering them 
with it. Let them remain eight days; take 
them out and put them in dishes and set 
the dishes in a hot oven, turning them until 
dry and the salt candies on them. Then 
put them in a pot, and put to twenty-five 
lemons one pound of white mustard seed, 
half pound of black pepper, the same of race 
ginger, a tablespoonf ul of mace, two of celery 
seed, a handful of horseradish, and a pound 
(or more) of brown sugar. Bruise the spices 
well, but do not poimd them. Slice the 
ginger. Put the spices in with the lemons 
and pour on the vinegar enough to cover 
them. Cover the pot closely as soon as the 
contents is entirely cold.

MARTINIA. 

Take the young and tender martinias, 
wash them, and put them in strong salt 
water for ten days. Then take, them out 
(they will probably have become very soft 
if not mashed up), wash them, and put in 
weak vinegar for five or six days. Then 
wash them carefully, and to one gallon of 
martinias put two quarts of strong cider 
vinegar, two ounces of scraped horseradish, 
one-half ounce of ginger, an ounce of all- 
spice, three-quarters of an ounce of black 
pepper, an ounce of black mustard seed (all 
beaten fine), two large silver onions chopped 
fine, two pounds of brown sugar, and a pod 
of pounded red pepper. Bottle this, cork 
and seal the bottles, and set them away in 
the cellar. 

NASTURTIUM. 

Gather the berries when they are green 
and tender and put them in brine for 
twenty-four hours. Then take them out of 
the brine, put them in a jar, and cover them 

(,92) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

with vinegar. To a gallon of nasturtiums 
put a gill of black pepper, broken, and a 
fourth of that quantity of bruised mace. 

OYSTERS, PICKLED. 

Wash the oysters carefully in the liquor 
and strain the liquor through a cloth. Put 
the oysters in a brass skillet with all of the 
liquor. Put the skillet on the fire and let 
them simmer for about twenty-five minutes, 
then take out the oysters, lay each one sep- 
arately in a dish, pour off the liquor, and 
when the oysters are cold, put them in a 
jar intermixed -with bruised allspice, black 
pepper, and cloves. Make the liquor very 
sdt ; add as much vinegar as there is liquor, 
and pour it on the oysters. The best way 
of putting up the oysters is to put in a 
layer of oysters, then the spice (do not put 
in so much spice that it will spoil the oys- 
ters), then poiu* on some of the liquor and 
vinegar, then a layer of oysters, and so on 
until the jar is filled. The oysters should 

{95) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

be cooked as much as when they are stewed 
for the table. Cover the jar closely. 

PEACHES, PICKLED. 

Gather the peaches when they are per- 
fectly ripe. The soft black Georgia peach 
or the white Heath peach make the best 
pickle. Wash them and put them in salt 
water for two days, then soak them in cold 
water for four or five hours. Wipe them 
carefully so as to get off as much of the 
fur as possible without bruising the peach. 
If the peaches are stoned, stuff them with 
mustard seed and a little pounded mace. 
Put one ounce of allspice, the same of cloves, 
the same of ginger, four ounces of black 
mustard seed (all well bruised), an ounce 
of horseradish scraped, and a poimd of sugar 
to a peck of peaches. 

PEACHES, GERMAN. 

Pare the peaches and weigh them. To 
eight pounds of peaches put one oimce of 

(.94) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

allspice, three-quarters of an ounce of cin- 
namon, and the same of cloves, also one 
quart of strong vinegar and four pounds of 
sugar. Put the sugar on the peaches and 
let them stand three or four hours to ex- 
tract juice enough. Then put the peaches, 
with the juice and sugar, on the fire; stew 
them about twenty minutes, then put in the 
vinegar and pounded spices and let it boil 
five or six minutes. It is then done. Should 
there not be vinegar enough to cover the 
peaches, add as much as is necessary; they 
cannot be entirely covered as they will float 
somewhat on the vinegar. Keep the jar 
covered closely. One quart of vinegar is 
quite sufficient to cover the peaches; they 
float on top at first, but sink down under 
the vinegar in one or two days* 

PICKLED STURGEON. 

After the backbone has been taken out 
the sturgeon should be washed, changing 
the water several times, and then put in salt 

(^5) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

water. After remaining twenty-four hours 
the salt water should be poured off and the 
sturgeon put in fresh salt water for twelve 
hours longer. The sturgeon should then be 
tied with a cord and boiled in weak salt 
water until a straw can be run through it» 
taking care to skim off the oil during boil- 
ing. Strain the liquor in which the stur- 
geon has been boiled and boil it a short 
time, adding allspice, pepper, and ginger, 
which should be broken a little in a mortar. 
After it has boiled sufficiently add as much 
vinegar as is agreeable to the taste, and 
when the liquor is cold put in the sturgeon. 
Should there not be liquor enough to cover 
the sturgeon add as much vinegar as is 
necessary. The vessel in which the stur- 
geon is kept should be covered closely and 
kept in a cool place. 

TOMATOES, GERMAN. 

To eight pounds of quite ripe, peeled to- 
matoes add four pounds of brown sugar. 

{96) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Put the tomatoes with all the juice and 
sugar into a glass- or porcelain-lined vessel 
and stew them until the syrup becomes of 
the consistency of a thick syrup. Add three- 
quarters of an ounce of allspice, half an 
ounce of cloves/ quarter of an ounce of mace 
(all pounded). Let them stew for a few 
minutes, and then take off the tomatoes and 
add one quart of vinegar. Pour them into 
a jar and when they are cold cover closely. 
Three and one-half pounds of sugar may 
be used instead of four pounds. They will 
be fit for use in two or three weeks. 

WHITE WALNUT PICKLE. 

Put the walnuts in strong salt water for 
ten or twelve days, then scald in ashes and 
water, to take off the fur and gummy sub- 
stance that adheres to them. Wipe them 
with a soft cloth, being careful not to bruise 
them. Put them in cold vinegar until Au- 
tumn. Then change the vinegar, and add to 
the fresh vinegar the following ingredients: 

{97) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

to one hundred walnuts put half a pint of 
mustard seed, a large silver onion stuck full 
of cloves, half an ounce of allspice, the same 
of black pepper, and two ounces of scraped 
horseradish. Mix these with the vinegar 
(the onions should be put in the jar with 
the walnuts), and pour over the pickle. 
Cover the jar with a bladder. They will 
be ready for use in six months. Take care 
that the walnuts are perfectly tender, other- 
wise it is useless to pickle them. The vine- 
gar in which the walnuts are kept until 
Autumn may be used for making catsup. 
The spices should be pounded before they 
are put in the vinegar, and vinegar and spices 
set in the hot sun a few hours before putting 
in the walnuts.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

(not much water) , and put them in the sun 
to bleach. After they are bleached, put them 
in cold water to soak for three or four hours. 
Then put them in a dye of turmeric and 
vinegar for a fortnight or three weeks. Take 
a pound of peeled garlic, sprinkle it with 
salt, and put it in the sun for three or four 
days, then wash it and dry it in the sun. 
Put half of it in the vinegar, adding one 
oimce of turmeric (beaten fine and put in 
a thin cotton bag), four ounces of ginger 
pounded or broken, two ounces of allspice 
half pounded, two of long pepper (soaked 
in warm water and sliced), three pounds 
of sugar, and four ounces of horseradish 
scraped. This seasoning is for two gallons 
of good cider vinegar. Set the vinegar in 
the hot sun every day for a month. 

Cuciunbers may be bleached or pickled by 
the same directions, but using half a pound 
of garlic for the same amount of seasoning. 
To stuff these mangoes, take one ounce of 
mace, two of turmeric, and two of celery 
seed well beaten, the remaining half pound

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

of garlic, horseradish scraped fine, and equal 
proportions of white and black mustard seed 
half pounded, mixed with three gills of sweet 
oil. Put the mangoes in jars, pour on the 
vinegar, spices, etc., to cover them, and cover 
closely with bladders and other covers if 
necessary. This pickle requires the same 
attention and is ready for use in the same 
time as the green mangoes. The mangoes 
should weigh from ten to twelve ounces.

BISCUIT, BEATEN. 

Take a quart of flour, two and a half 
ounces of lard, one and three-quarters gills 
of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. Stir up 
the greater part of the flour with the lard, 
milk, and salt, then beat the biscuit with 
a heavy iron beater on a strong wooden 
mortar for twenty minutes, adding the re- 
mainder of the flour as you beat except a 
little for rolling out the biscuit. Then roll 
them well and divide the dough into four- 
teen biscuits. Stick them on top with a two- 
pronged fork. It takes half an hour for 
them to bake. They are much nicer made 
with cream instead of milk. Thin biscuits 
are made in exactly the same manner except 
they require less milk. Be very careful not 
to put in too much salt.

BISCUIT, SODA. 

Soda biscuit are made with one drachm 
of bicarbonate of soda and two drachms of 
cream of tartar to one quart of flour, two 
or three ounces of lard, a little salt, and 
two gills and a half of milk. Dissolve the 
soda in the milk, stir the cream of tartar 
in the flour, and sift it with the flour. This 
bread should be made and baked as quickly 
as possible. The mufiins and soda cakes 
have the same quantity of soda and cream 
of tartar mixed in the same manner. The 
mufiins are made with two or three eggs, 
two ounces of lard, and three gills of milk, 
also a little salt to the quart. The cakes 
are made with three eggs, a pint of milk, 
and a little salt to the quart. They are 
baked on the griddle like any other bread. 
Soda dissolved in very sour buttermilk, or 
clabber, makes pretty good bread«

CAKES, BUCKWHEAT. 

To one quart of buckwheat put half a pint 
of meal, about lialf a gill of yeast, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, mixing up the whole with 
about a pint of warm water. Set it in a 
warm place to rise; when it has risen suf- 
ficiently bake it in large cakes on a griddle. 
Have a plate of fresh butter set by the fire 
to keep soft, and as you take the cakes off 
the griddle dip them in the butter. 

CAKES, VELVET. 

To one quart of flour put four eggs, four 
ounces of lard, half a gill of yeast, half a 
pint of water, and a teaspoonful of salt« 
Make this into a batter and set it in a warm 
place to rise; when it has risen sufficiently 
add nearly half a pint of water or milk, 
then stir it welL Have the griddle the 
proper heat, put a little lard upon it, and 
bake the batter in small cakes. They look 
fine baked in rings. If the yeast is at all 
bitter, half a gill to a quart of flour is too 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

much, as it may give the bread a bitter 
taste, — a fourth of a gill will be sufficient. 
Add as much more water as you leave out 
yeast. 

CORNBREAD, RICE. 

Boil eight ounces of rice and let it get 
cold. Take six eggs, all the rice, a quart 
of meal, a little salt, one and a half pint of 
milk. Beat the eggs well. Rub a dish 
with lard, pour in the batter, and bake it. 
Combread requires less salt and takes a 
longer time to bake than any kind of bread 
made of flour. Do not put the rice in 
until all the other ingredients are stirred 
together. 

CRACKERS. 

Take one quart of flour, one egg, three 
ounces of butter, the same of lard, a little 
salt; make up the dough with sweet milk. 
Beat the dough well with an iron beater 
and roll it out in the thinnest cakes, stick

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

them with a fork, and bake crisp. Cream 
makes the crackers better than milk. 

LOAF BREAD CAKES. 

Cut off the outside crusts of a quart loaf, 
cut it into small pieces, and soak it in about 
one quart of milk for some hours. Mash 
the bread perfectly and add half a pint of 
flour, six eggs, and a little salt. The cakes 
may be made of bread a week or ten days 
old, or of very sour bread. If it is sour 
put a teaspoonful (a little rounding) of soda 
in some of the milk, dissolve it perfectly, 
and stir it in well. Bake these cakes on 
the griddle like any other batter bread. 
Very good waffles are made in this man- 
ner, adding a pint more milk for the waffles 
than for the cakes baked on the griddle. 

MUFFINS, ENGLISH. 

To one quart of flour put two tablespoon- 
fuls of yeast, two eggs, two ounces of lard, 

U07) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

two and a half gills of water, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Beat the eggs well, add 
the yeast and some water, stir in the flour, 
and then add the remainder of the water 
and the salt. Work the batter well. Put 
it in a warm place to rise. When it has 
risen sufficiently stir it well and put it into 
muffin rings, which should have been rubbed 
well with lard, and bake. In measuring 
flour always see that it is well lightened, 
else you will get more than a quart in the 
quart measure.

MUFFINS, SODA. 

Soda biscuit are made with one drachm 
bicarbonate of soda and two drachms of 
cream of tartar to one quart of floiu*, two 
or three ounces of lard, a little salt, and two 
gills and a half of milk. Dissolve the soda 
in the milk, stir the cream of tartar in the 
flour, and sift it with the flour. This bread 
should be baked as soon after making as 
possible. The muffins and soda crackers 

if 08) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

have the same quantity of soda and cream 
of tartar mixed in the same mahner. The 
muffins are made with two or three eggs, 
two ounces of lard, and three gills of milk, 
also a little salt, to the quart. The cakes 
are made with three eggs, a pint of milk, 
and a little salt to the quart. They are 
baked on the griddle like any other bread. 
Soda dissolved in very sour buttermilk 
makes good bread. 

ROLLS. 

Take one quart of flour, two tablespoon- 
fuls of yeast, two eggs, two ounces of lard, 
a gill of water, and a teaspoonful of salt. 
Knead the dough as for loaf bread and 
prepare it in the same manner for baking. 
Rolls are often made without eggs, in which 
case they require a gill and three-fourths 
of water and three ounces of lard. Put a 
dry potato well mashed in the yeast as you 
do for loaf bread. 

{t09) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

RUSKS. 

Take one quart of flour, four ounces (or 
a small teacup) of loaf sugar, half a gill of 
potato yeast (or two tablespoonfuls of hop 
yeast), half a pint of water, and two or 
three ounces of sweet lard. Make this up 
as you do for loaf bread and set it to rise. 
After it has risen, divide it into pieces the 
size and shape of rolls; put them in an 
oven by the fire to rise. When they have 
risen sufficiently in the oven, take the yel- 
low of an egg, well beaten and mixed with 
a little water, and glaze the top of the rusks ; 
then bake them until they are done. Rusks 
sometimes have currants put in them, only 
a small quantity, however. 

SALLY LUNN. 

To one quart of flour put two tablespoon- 
fuls of yeast, four eggs, four ounces of lard, 
nearly half a pint of water, and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Make this into a batter as you 
do for muffins, and set it in a warm place 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

to rise; when it has risen sufficiently put 
it into a mould that has been rubbed with 
flour and set it in an oven by the fire to 
rise, which it should do in about three- 
quarters of a hour, and then bake it. 

WAFFLES, RICE. 

Boil half a pound of rice, when it is cold 
add to it four eggs, a pint of flour, and a 
little salt, mixing up the whole with as 
much sweet milk as will make it a soft 
batter. Put a small piece of lard in the 
waffle irons, have them the proper heat, and 
fill them with the batter; they must be 
turned once or twice in the baking. Beat 
the eggs well, then add the rice, then the 
flour and salt ; stir in the milk last of all. 

CAKES 

BLACK CAKE. 

To one quart of flour put four eggs, twelve 
oimces of butter, a teaspoonful of soda dis- 
solved in half a gill of rich sour cream, six 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

ounces of brown sugar, nearly a pint of 
molasses, one-half of a gill of pounded gin- 
ger, the same of poimded allspice, a table- 
spoonful of pounded cloves, and a little salt. 
Pour it into a pan properly prepared, and 
bake. It takes from three to four hours 
for a three-pint cake to bake. 

BUNS. 

Take a quart of flour, two tablespoonfuls 
of yeast, two eggs, two ounces of lard, a 
gill of water, and a little salt. Prepare 
them as you do rolls. After they have risen 
sufficiently, add ten ounces of brown sugar, 
a third of a gill of pounded allspice, with 
a few cloves poimded. Work the dough 
well and divide into fourteen rolls. Set it 
to rise as you do the rolls; when it has 
risen bake it. 

CHEESE CAKES. 

Take two quarts of sour milk, put it on 
the fire in a brass skillet, and add as much 

{it 2) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

vinegar as will turn it to a thick curd. Take 
out the curds without any whey ; beat them 
well, adding half a pound of butter. Then 
stir in six eggs well beaten and eight ounces 
of sugar, seasoning with mace or nutmeg. 
Poiu* this compound into little moulds of 
pastry, and bake it. Serve up cold. Eight 
eggs and six ounces of butter may be used 
instead of six eggs and eight ounces of 
butter. The salt should be washed out of 
the butter for cheese cakes.

CHERRY CAKE. 

Take one quart of flour, five eggs, half 
a pound of butter, six ounces of brown 
sugar, about a pint of molasses, three tea- 
spoonfuls of pounded allspice, one and a 
half teaspoonfuls of pounded cinnamon, a 
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little sour 
cream, a little salt, and twelve ounces of 
dried cherries. Prepsure and bake like any 
other cake of the kind. More cherries can 
be used if you prefer. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

CITRON CAKE. 

One pound of flour, one of sugar, one of 
eggs, and one of butter; prepare this ex- 
actly as you do for pound cake. Slice a 
pound of citron into small, thin slices, rub 
it in flour, and stir it in the cake. All cakes 
but fruit cake should be half cold before 
taking them out of the pan. 

COMPOSITION CAKE. 

One and three-quarters pounds of flour, a 
pound and a quarter of sugar, twelve ounces 
of butter, three gills of milk, six eggs, two 
pounds of seedless plums, half a gill of 
brandy, a gill of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, 
cloves, and allspice) pounded very fine, and 
a heaping teaspoonful of soda dissolved in 
some of the milk (which should be sour). 
Each plum should be cut in two or three 
pieces and the pieces rolled in flour before 
being put in the cake. Have the pans pre- 
pared, put in the cake, and bake. Beat the 
whites and yellows of the eggs separately. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and bake the cake immediately after it is 
made. 

CREAM CAKE. 

To three pints of flour put two of loaf 
sugar and three-quarters of a pint of cream, 
two drachms of cream of tartar and one of 
soda, eight eggs, and a little mace or nut- 
meg. Beat the eggs well, yellows and 
whites together. Put in the eggs, then the 
flour. Dissolve the soda in the cream and 
stir it in the sugar, egg^, etc. Mix the 
cream of tartar with the flour before sift- 
ing it and stir it in the cake. Bake imme- 
diately in pans that have been rubbed with 
lard. 

FRUIT CAKE. 

One pound of flour, one of sugar, one of 
eggs, one of butter, two of seedless raisins, 
two of picked currants, four ounces of 
blanched almonds sliced fine, and four 
ounces of citron sliced fine. First prepare 
the sugar, eggs, flour, etc., exactly as you 

(//5) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

do for pound cake. Cut the pltuns in two 
or three pieces^ and roll them, the currants, 
and the citron in flour before putting in the 
cake. The best way of rolling them in the 
flour is to put them in a sifter with some 
flour and stir them about in it with the 
hand until all the flour falls through, ex- 
cept what adheres to the fruit. It takes 
more than double as long for this cake to 
bake than for pound cake. Have the pan 
well rubbed with lard. Let the cake be 
entirely cold before taking it out of the 
pan. 

GENERAL R. E. LEE CAKE. 

Take eighteen eggs, equal weight of all 
the eggs in sugar, and half the weight in 
flour. Make as you would sponge cake. 
Use the rinds and juice of two large oranges 
and two large lemons (or three medium- 
sized ones of each kind), half of these to 
go for an icing and the other half in the 
cake. Make the icing of the whites of six 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

eggs, two and a half pounds of pulverized 
sugar^ and the fruit rinds and juice. The 
rinds and juice put in the icing must be 
strained through muslin. After standing a 
while on the rind to extract the juice, put 
the icing between the cakes like jelly. Set 
them in the stove for four or five minutes 
to dry the icing. 

GINGER CAKES. 

Mix one quart of flour, four ounces of lard, 
a third of a gill of ginger, a full one of brown 
sugar, two gills of good molasses, and a little 
salt. Add a rounding teaspoonful of soda 
beaten up in some of the molasses. The 
dough should be kneaded and rolled well, 
cut in thin cakes, and baked crisp. 

LEMON CAKE. 

Take one pound of loaf sugar, three- 
quarters of a pound of butter, eight eggs, 
six ounces of flour, and juice of three lemons

twelve ounces of loaf sugar, put it into a 
pan prepared as for other cakes, and after 
it is risen bake slowly. 

MILK FRITTERS. 

One quart of flour, one pint of milk, seven 
eggSy and a little salt. Put the pan on the 
fire, mix half the flour in a batter, and pour

cake. 

OLD MAID. 

Take one pound of the whitest flour, one 
pound of loaf sugar, one pound or three- 
quarters of a pound of fresh butter, and the 
whites of twelve eggs. Wash all the salt 
out of the butter, and cream it with flour 
as for pound cake. Beat the white of eggs 
to a froth, stir in the sugar, and then beat 
in the creamed butter and flour. Bake in 
a mould or in cups. 

PANCAKES. 

To one quart of flour put one quart of 
milk and eight eggs. Beat the eggs well, 
stir in the flour and a little salt, then pour 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES

Have your pan hot with a spoonful of lard 
in it and put in as much batter as will barely 
cover the bottom. When it is browned suf- 
ficiently turn and fry on the other side. If 
you like pancakes very thin add half a pint 
of milk to the above quantity. 

PLUM CAKE. 

One pound of sugar, one pound of eggs, 
one pound of butter, and one pound of flour.

stir the sugar in the yolks, then the creamed 
flour. Wash the salt out of the butter and 

{f20) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

work it with the flour, until the mixture 
becomes what is called a cream, that is 
white and of the consistency of thick cream. 
Then work it into the cake and beat the 
cake for twenty minutes with a strong hand. 
Have a cake pan rubbed with a little lard, 
pour in the cake, and bake it with a slow 
heat. The whites of the eggs are not put 
in until after the butter and flour, creamed 
together, is beaten in. 

SOFT GINGER CAKES. 

Five eggs well beaten, two cups of mo- 
lasses, one cup of brown sugar, one cup of 
butter, five cups of flour, and three table- 
spoonfuls of pounded ginger. If the butter 
is fresh add a little pinch of salt, and lastly 
a drachm of soda dissolved in half a cup of 
sour cream or milk. Bake in a brisk oven 
in smsdl pans. All soda breads and cakes 
bake best in shallow pans or moulds of tin. 
There is no objection to the pans being large 
if they are shallow.

PUDDINGS 



PUDDINGS 

APPLE. 

To one pint of stewed apples put twelve 
ounces of brown sugar, half a pound of fresh 
butter, and eight eggs. Pass the apples 
through a colander as soon as you take 
them off the fire, then immediately stir in 
the butter. Beat the eggs well, stirring the 
sugar,^ and then mix them with the apples 
and butter. Have a dish prepared with 
paste as for cocoanut pudding; pour in the 
pudding and bake it. Serve up cold. Wash 
the salt out of the butter for this pudding. 
The apples should be stewed dry. 

COCOANUT. 

Beat to a light froth the yolks of eight 
eggs, add one pound brown sugar, and eight 
ounces of fresh butter. Set these ingredi- 
ents on the fire in an earthen dish and stir

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

them for seven or eight minutes. Grate or 
beat up in a mortar one cocoanut, after 
carefully scraping ofiF the rind, and mix it 
with the above ingredients. Pour it into 
a dish with pastry aroimd the edges and 
at the bottom, and bake until done. Serve 
up cold. The whites of eggs make an equally 
good pudding prepared with the same in- 
gredients as the yolks, but they are put to- 
gether in difiFerent proportions. The salt 
should be washed out of the butter for this 
pudding. 

CUSTARD, BAKED. 

To three pints of milk put one pint of 
flour, nine eggs, and a little salt. Beat the 
eggs well, then stir in the flour, then pour 
on the milk. Rub a little butter free of 
salt on the sides of a deep dish in which 
the pudding is to be baked. Bake for rather 
more than an hour with a quick heat. Serve 
up hot with cream sauce. This pudding is 
to be baked immediately after making or

separately. When they are sufficiently 
beaten put them together and add three- 
quarters of a quart of flour and a quart of 
milk, with a little salt. Pour into a cloth 
properly prepared and boil it. A thinner 
and softer pudding may be made with one 
pint of flour, one quart of milk, and eight 
eggs. Serve up hot with wine or cream 
sauce. Boiled puddings or dumplings are 
put on to boil in boiling water. 

DIXIE.

soak it in a quart of milk, beat up ten eggs 
and add to the bread and milk a pound and 
a quarter of fine chopped mutton suet, half 
a pint of flour, a little salt, and three pounds 
of seedless raisins. The raisins should be cut 
in two and rolled in flour before they are 
put in the pudding. Dip a strong cotton 
or linen cloth in hot water, sprinkle it with 
flour, and then pour in the pudding, tying 
it securely, while not so as to press the 
pudding. Put it in a pot of boiling water 
and let it boil four hours. Serve up hot

the pudding on the fire in the earthen dish 
in which it is made and stir it constantly 
until it begins to thicken. Then put in a 
dish prepared with paste and bake it. Serve 
up cold. Wash the salt out of the butter 
for this pudding. 

MERINGUE. 

Take the amount of two rolls, or say three 
slices of stale bread, pour over them one 
pint of milk, and let it soak a short time.

lade of any kind. Whip up the whites of 
four eggs to a stifiF froth with a teacup of 
white sugar; spread this over the layer of 
fruity and set it in the oven for a few min- 
utes until it is a light brown color. You 
may flavor the pudding with vanilla or any 
spice. The flavoring is put in the whites 
of eggs and white sugar. 

MOLASSES. 

Prepare a quart loaf as for preserve pud- 
ding. Butter the bread, using half a pound 
of butter for that purpose. Take three pints 
of molasses and stir in three-quarters of a 
gill of pounded ginger. Lay the bread in 
the dish and pour on the moletsses between

and cinnamon, and a quart of new milk; 
put all in the stewpan on the fire; as soon 
as it commences boiling put in three or four 
ounces of clean picked tapioca; let it sim- 
mer gently until the tapioca is soft, then 
take out the lemon peel and cinnamon. Add 
the whites of two and the yolks of six egg^, 
beaten well, and sweeten to taste. Put the 
whole into a well-buttered pudding mould, 
cover with a piece of buttered paper, and 
steam in a stew pan for one hour with as

little water as possible. Take it out of the 
stewpan and let it stand for a few minutes 
before turning it out. This pudding may 
be baked like rice pudding. It may be made 
richer by adding a large slice of butter when 
the eggs are put in, or by using cream in- 
stead of milk. Serve up cold. 

TRANSPARENT. 

Take eight eggs, half a pound of butter, 
half a pound of loaf sugar, season with 
nutmeg, ginger, or any seasoning you like. 
Beat the eggs well, add the butter and 
sugar, put it on the fire and stir until it 
begins to thicken, then pour it into a dish 
prepared with paste, and bake it. Serve 
up warm. Wash the salt out of the butter 
for this pudding. 

VIRGINIA PLUM. 

Take one pound of flour, one pound of 
loaf sugar, three-quarters of a pound of 

{i37) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

butter, and twelve eggs. Beat the yolks 
and whites separately until they are both 
very light, stir the sugar in the yolks, then 
add the whites. Cream the butter and flour 
together and then beat in the sugar and 
eggs. Take two pounds of stoned plums, 
cut them in two, roll them in flour, and put 
them in the pudding; also put in a little 
mace. Boil for four hours and serve the 
pudding hot with rice sauce.

ICING. 

The whites of fourteen eggs, three pounds 
of sugar, and three gills of water. Boil the 
sugar and water until the syrup will rope, 
then pour it into a dish and beat it to blood 
heat. Have the whites beaten to a light 
froth ; season with extract of lemon. When 
a cake is to be iced it should be glazed over 
with the white of an egg while it is warm 
— the glazing can be put on with a stiff 
feather. The sugar must be poimded and 
sifted through a fine sieve for icing and 
must be white loaf sugar. Another way 
of making icing is to beat the whites of 
four eggs to a froth and then beat in a 
pound of sugar; season with lemon. The 
thickness of the icing 4epends upon the 
nimiber of coats put on the cakes.

CREAMED. 

Stir together one pound of pulverized 
sugar and eight ounces of butter until they 
become a sort of cream ; then stir in a gill of 
good Madeira wine, and grate in sufficient 
nutmeg. This sauce is improved by adding 
two tablespoonfuls of rich cream before 
putting in the wine. 

WINE. 

Take one pound and a half of loaf sugar, 
a gill of very thin paste, six ounces of but- 
ter, and two gills of good Madeira wine; 
have the paste very hot, so as to make the 
batter. After stirring it in beat in the sugar, 
grate in half a nutmeg; last of all pour in 
the wine just as you are ready to serve the 
sauce. It should be kept by the fire always 
until wanted.

BLACKBERRY. 

To one quart of blackberries put three- 
quarters of a pound of brown sugar; put 
the sugar and fruit on the fire together and 
stew them until they are quite done, stir- 
ring them all the time. Put them into a 
jar, and when they are entirely cold cover 
closely. 

CHERRY. 

Draw the stones out of the cherries by 
the stems, weigh the fruit, and to one pound 
of cherries put a pound or a pound and a 
quarter of pounded loaf sugar. Put the 
sugar over the cherries an hour or two be- 
fore preserving them; stew them until they 
are done, then put them into jars (small 
jars are the best). When they are entirely 
cold paste on a paper cover and leave them 
for two or three weeks.

CHERRY PEPPER. 

Gather the peppers when they are young 
and tender, put them in brine for three 
weeks, changing the brine every two days. 
Then cut a slit into the side of them and 
take out the seeds. Afterward put them in 
cold water for a week, changing the water 
every day. Green the peppers with alum 
and grape leaves in a brass skillet; then 
throw them into cold water for twenty-four 
hours, changing the water once. Weigh the 
peppers, and into every poimd of peppers 
put two pounds of loaf sugar and a quart 
of water. After making the syrup, boil the 
peppers in it for fifteen minutes, then put 
them in a jar and pour the syrup on them. 
Every other day pour off the syrup, boil 
it, and pour it back on the peppers; con- 
tinue until the syrup is thick enough. Sea- 
son with extract of lemon or mace. The 
peppers may require rather more than fif- 
teen minutes for boiling in water and in the 
syrup. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

CRAB APPLE. 

Pare the crab apples and weigh them. To 
a pound of fruit put a pound of sugar and 
a quart of water. Put the parings with a 
few crab apples, cut into quarters, and the 
water into a skillet; boil for half an hour. 
Strain the juice through a coarse cloth, put 
in the sugar, and make the syrup ; then put 
in the fruit and boil it until perfectly done 
(it will turn a pretty red). Take it out and 
let the syrup remain until it becomes a thin 
jelly. When both syrup and fruit are en- 
tirely cold put them into jars and cover 
closely. This fruit should be preserved early 
in October, when firm or hard. Always 
gather it from the trees and select those 
apples that are of middle size. The apples 
should be laid in a dish to get cold and the 
syrup put into a bowl until it is cold. 

DAMSON. 

Pick the stems off the damsons and 
weigh them. To one pound of fruit put 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

three-quarters of a pound of brown sugar. 
Stew them until they are done, stirring 
them all the time and taking out the 
stones; put them into a jar and cover 
closely. Put the damsons to stew without 
the sugar; after the skins have burst and 
the juices run out add the sugar. 

FIG. 

Gather the figs before they are perfectly 
ripe, with a short stem, slit them on one 
side, and soak in lime water three or four 
hours, then soak in water until they lose 
the taste of lime. Make a S3nnip of loaf 
sugar, one pound of sugar, and one pint 
of water to one pound of fruit. After the 
syrup has boiled a short time drop in the 
figs and boil until done. 

GREEN SWEETMEAT. 

Peel the melons and lay them in salt water 
for four or five days, changing the water 
every other day. Green them with alum

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and grape leaves; then throw them in cold 
water for twenty-four hours, changing the 
water once. Boil them in water until you 
can stick a straw through them easily; then 
throw them into a tub of ice water, chang- 
ing the water to take out the alum. Weigh 
the melons, and to each pound put two 
poimds of loaf sugar and one quart of water; 
make your syrup, and season with ginger, 
extract of lemon, or mace. If you season 
with extract of lemon (then soak them in 
cold water twenty-four hours) or mace, do 
not put it in until you have boiled the syrup 
for the last time, then put it in just before 
poiuing on the sweetmeats. If you season 
with ginger beat some white ginger fine, 
tie it in a little piece of muslin, and let it 
boil in the syrup the last time it is boiled, 
until there is a strong taste of ginger. Boil 
the melons in the syrup about hsdf an hour, 
then put them in jars and cover close to 
keep in the steam. Every other day pour 
off the syrup, boil it, and pour it back on 
the melons. Repeat this process until it 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

is thick enough. The last time the syrup 
is boiled let it get cold before the jars are 
covered. If you preserve the glass melons 
be sure they are not too tender. Take out 
the seeds after they have been greened and 
are cold. 

LEATHER — APPLE, 

PEACH, AND PEAR. 

Peel the fruit and stew it with a sufficient 
quantity of water imtil it is perfectly done, 
then pass it through a colander so as to 
avoid having hard bits in the fruit. Sea- 
son the apples with ginger; the pears and 
peaches are best without seasoning. Sweeten 
to taste with brown sugar. Rub butter 
(without any salt on it) on the bottom of 
long dishes and spread the fruit on them 
in layers about a third of an inch thick, 
and set them in the sun to dry. After the 
fruit has dried on the upper side turn it 
over carefully, and when it has dried suf- 
ficiently on that side turn it over again, and 

{tSO) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

keep turning it until it is perfectly dry. 
Always take it in at night. When it is 
quite dry put it away in jars with a little 
powdered loaf sugar put between the pieces 
of leather. 

MARMALADE — PEACH, 

PEAR, AND QUINCE. 

To one pound of pears put three-quarters 
of a pound of brown sugar and a gill of 
water; quinces take about half a pint, and 
pejiches half a gill. Put the fruit and water 
in a brass vessel and let it stew about an 
hour, or until it has become a jam. Do not 
put the sugar in imtil the fruit has been 
stewed soft; stir the fruit constantly after 
you put in the sugar. When the marma- 
lade is done put it into jars, and when it 
is perfectly cold cover the jars closely.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

changing the water once. Then put them 
in cold water and boil them until a straw 
can be darted through them. Throw away 
the water in which the oranges are boiled, 
as it has a bitter taste. Make a syrup of 
two pounds of loaf sugar and a pint of 
water to a pound of oranges; perforate the 
oranges all over with a sharp two-pronged 
fork or knitting-needle, and boil them in 
syrup. After the oranges are done take 
them out, and let the syrup boil imtil it is 
thick enough; then pour it hot over the 
oranges. The second day examine the 
oranges, and if the syrup is not thick 
enough boil it over and pour it hot on them. 
It must cover the oranges. Weigh the 
oranges before putting them in the water. 

ORANGE PEEL. 

Take off the peelings carefully ; take only 
those peelings that are thick and have no 
imperfections on them; weigh them, then 
lay in cold water for two days, changing 

(/5i) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

the water night and morning. Boil them 
in water until you can run a straw through 
them, then take them out and lay them 
separately in a dish. Do not use the water 
in which the peelings were boiled for mak- 
ing the syrup. Make a syrup with two 
pounds of loaf sugar to a quart of water 
(for a pound of peelings). Boil the peel- 
ings in it until done, then put them in jars, 
and when the syrup is done pour it over 
the peelings. To candy the peelings boil 
the syrup longer. 

PEACH. 

Pare the peaches carefully and take out 
the stones of about half the quantity you 
wish to preserve. To one pound of fruit 
put one pound of loaf sugar and half a pint 
of water. Put the sugar and water on the 
fire, let it boil for twenty minutes, then put 
in the peaches and boil them for a time, or 
until they are nearly transparent. After 
they are done lay them in a dish, each peach

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

separate from the others. Boil the syrup 
until it becomes ropy, put it in a bowl, to 
get entirely cold; when both syrup and 
peaches are entirely cold put them in jars 
and cover closely. It is an improvement 
to the peaches to put a few peeled kernels 
into the syrup. In making preserves the 
heat should be uniform and not too great. 
If the fruit boils too fast it will not be so 
perfect* 

PEAR. 

Pare the pears, leaving the stems on, and 
weigh them. To one pound of fruit put a 
pound of loaf sugar (if fruit is sweet) or 
a pound and a quarter (if fruit is sour), and 
one pint of water. Boil the sugar and water 
about fifteen minutes, then put in the pears, 
and boil until a straw can be run through 
them. Take them out, lay them in a dish, 
boil the sjnrup until it becomes a thin jelly, 
then pour into a bowl. When the fruit and 
syrup become entirely cold put them into 
jars and cover closely. The pears should 

if 54) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

be red and nearly transparent before they 
are taken out of the syrup. 

QUINCE. 

Pare the quinces and take out the cores, 
after cutting them into quarters. Put the 
cores and peelings in a brass skillet, with 
rather more than a quart of water for every 
pound of cores and peelings. Boil for about 
half an hour, then strain through a coarse 
cloth, set the juice back on the fire and put 
in the quinces, boiling them until half done ; 
then take them out and put in the sugar, 
a pound for every pound of fruit (loaf sugar 
is used always for fruits preserved whole). 
Boil the syrup about two or three minutes, 
then put back the quinces and let them re- 
main until they have become a pretty red 
color and look transparent. Then take them 
out and let the syrup continue to boil until 
it becomes a thin jelly. When both fruit 
and syrup, or jelly, are entirely cold put 
them into jars and cover them closely. The 

{t55) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

slices of quinces should be laid separately 
in a dish to cool and the S3nrup poured into 
a bowl to cool. 

RASPBERRY. 

To one quart of raspberries put three- 
quarters of a pound of brown sugar; set 
the sugar and fruit on the fire together and 
stew until the fruit is done. Stew it so as 
not to let the fruit biuti, but take care not 
to overheat it. Put it into jars and when 
it is quite cold cover closely. 

STRAWBERRY. 

To one pound of strawberries put one 
pound and four ounces of loaf sugar, laying 
the sugar on the fruit about three hours 
before you are ready to preserve it. Then 
set it on the fire and let it stew about 
twenty minutes, stirring it carefully so as 
to prevent burning, but at the same time 
do not break the fruit. Put it into half- 
pint tumblers, and when cold paste covers

about a fortnight* Strawberry marmcilade, 
or jam, is made with three-quarters of a 
pound of brown sugar to a pound of fruit 
and stewed imtil it becomes a thick jam, 
being stirred all the time. Put it into jars 
and when cold cover closely. It is better 
to let the marmalade get cold before put* 
ting it in jars, some think.

JELLY 



JELLY 

APPLE. 

Take eight pounds of crab apples, or any 
winter apple that has a pleasant flavor, wash 
them and cut them into quarters. Add to 
this quantity four quarts of water and stew 
them until they are entirely done. Then 
strain the juice through a coarse cloth. This 
quantity of fruit will make four pints of 
juice. To each pint put a pound of loaf 
sugar, then boil until the whole becomes 
a thick jelly. When cold put it into jars 
and cover closely. The pu^ of the apple 
or of quinces and pears made into jelly may 
be passed through a sieve and, with the 
addition of sugar, makes a jam. 

CRANBERRY. 

To one pound of cranberries put one and 
a quarter pounds. of loaf sugar and a gill 

(/6/) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and a half of water. Stew for about half 
an hour; when cold they are ready for use. 
They will keep two or three weeks. To 
make cranberry jelly, put two or three gills 
of water to a pound of the fruit; stew it 
to a perfect pulp, strain the juice through 
a piece of muslin, and put a pound of loaf 
sugar to every pint of juice. Boil it until 
it becomes a jelly, then pour it into moulds. 

CURRANT. 

Press the currants and strain the juice 
through a cloth; to one pint of juice put 
one pound of loaf sugar. Let the sugar and 
juice boil for twelve minutes, then put it 
into half-pint tumblers, and when the jelly 
is cold paste on covers of white paper. Sun 
the jelly for about a fortnight.

FOX GRAPE. 

Gather the grapes when they are green and 
tender, take as many as you wish, pick off 
the stems, and stew them in a brass skillet 
with sufEcient water until they are entirely 
done. It takes just four poimds of the 
fruit and one pint of water to make three 
pints of juice. Strain the stewed grapes 
through a coarse cloth, and to one pint of 
juice put a pound of loaf sugar; let it boil 
until it becomes a thick jelly. Pour it into 
moulds, and when it is cold cover the moulds 
with paper. The best way to strain the 
juice is to first pass it through a colander, 
and then strain through a muslin cloth. 
Put a small piece of alum with the grapes 
to green the jelly. 

GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

To every pound of gooseberries *put two 
gills of water. Set them on the fire and

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Stew them to a pulp, adding a piece of alum 
the size of a plum. Strain the juice through 
a muslin cloth, but do not press the fruit 
too much or the jelly will not be so clear. 
To every pint of juice put a pound of loaf 
sugar. Boil it until it becomes a jelly ; then 
pour in the moulds. Cover the moulds. 

QUINCE AND PEAR. 

These jellies are made exactly in the same 
manner as the apple jelly, except that the 
quinces require rather more water for the 
same quantity of fruit. They may be 
moulded in blanc mange moulds. Cover the 
moulds, and when you wish to take them 
out, dip the moulds in hot water or hold 
them over the fire.

ICE CREAM AND ICES 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 

BURNT SUGAR. 

To one quart of new milk put eight eggs 
(leaving out the whites if you prefer), beat- 
ing the eggs well. Stir in a tablespoonful of 
flour, strain the eggs through a sieve, and 
add them to the milk. Take ten ounces of 
light brown sugar, put it into a skillet, and 
stir it until it boils up. Add the eggs and 
milk and boil two or three minutes. Sea- 
son with cinnamon* pounded, put in a muslin 
bag and boiled in the custard. As soon as 
the custard is cdld freeze it. 

CARAMEL. 

To one quart of fresh cream put ten 
ounces of light brown sugar and a table- 
spoonful of flour. Put the sugar into a 
brass skillet and let it boil up, stirring it 
constantly. Mix the flour with a little of 

(/67) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cream and then add the remainder of cream, 
stirring it well so as to distribute the flour 
equally without any lumps throughout the 
cream. As soon as the sugar boils up pour 
on the cream and let it stay until the sugar 
mixes entirely with it, which is done by a 
constant stirring. Season with powdered 
cinnamon, and as soon as it is entirely cold 
freeze it. Brown sugar (it should be of 
the nicest) is much better than loaf sugar 
for caramel, as the loaf sugar has a bitter 
taste when burned. 

COCOANUT CREAM. 

To two quarts of Cream put two cocoa- 
nuts (grated or beaten fine in a mortar), 
and a pound and four ounces of sugar. Beat 
the cream and cocoanut well together. The 
cream may be whipped before the cocoanut 
is put in.

LEMON CREAM. 

To one quart of pure cream put one quart 
of buttermilk, one pound of loaf sugar, the 
juice of two lemons, of medium size, with 
the oil from the rind of three or four of 
them. This cream may be made with the oil 
of lemon, but it is not so good as when 
made with the fresh lemon. Put the cream 
in the freezer on the ice before putting in 
the lemon. To obtain the oil from the rind, 
rub the sugar on the rind* 

ORANGE ICE. 

To two quarts of pure juice put one pound 
and six oimces of loaf sugar. To make 
orange ice cream, to two quarts of pure 
cream put twelve ounces of sugar and sea- 
son it to the taste with extract of orange. 
The proper proportions for freezing is one 
pound of fine salt to two pounds of pounded 
ice.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

PEACH. 

To two quarts of good cream put one 
poimd and a half of loaf sugar and one 
quart of peaches (the soft peach) mashed 
to a pulp. The peaches must be perfectly 
ripe; take out the stringy substance that 
is next to the stone and mash them to a 
soft pulp. They are much nicer when 
passed through a colander if you have one 
of silver; a tin one will give them a taste. 
The ice cream is very good with only one 
quart of pure cream and one quart of milk. 

SHERBET. 

To one pint of water put one pound of 
loaf sugar, the juice of six lemons, and the 
whites of one dozen eggs beaten to a froth. 
Mix the sugar with the lemon juice and 
water as soon as the eggs are beaten, and 
stir them in and freeze immediately. The 
lemons must be large and well flavored.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

STRAWBERRY. 

To two quarts of pure, rich, sweet cream, 
put seven-eighths of a quart of pure straw- 
berry juice, and one quart of pounded loaf 
sugar; the cream should be at the freezing 
point when the juice is put in. Mix the 
sugar and cream well together ; pour in the 
flavoring ; set the freezer in the ice and salt 
and, when it is cold, stir in the juice. This 
cream and all the other creams, except peach 
and cocoanut, should be whipped with a 
whip just before freezing, unless a patent 
freezer is used — they always have dashers 
in them. Very good strawberry cream can 
be made by putting three-quarters of a quart 
of mashed strawberries to one quart of 
cream and one quart of milk. 

The ice for freezing should be broken into 
small pieces and mixed with about half its 
weight of salt. Cover the vessel which con- 
tains the freezer with a woolen cloth unless 
it has a wooden cover. Shake the freezer 
constantly, unless you have a freezer with 
a dasher inside, in which case you turn that

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

constantly until the cream is frozen too hard 
to move it easily. Always freeze in a pantry 
or a cool room in the basement. One quart 
of sugar weighs one pound and four ounces. 

SYLLABUB. 

To one pint of rich cream add half a pint 
of Madeira wine ; sweeten to your taste with 
loaf sugar. Whip with a whip and chum 
in a cool room ; or put the cream on the ice 
if the weather is warm. If you want the 
syllabub dry put it in a sieve to drip as fast 
as you whip it up. 

VANILLA. 

To two quarts of pure cream put twelve 
ounces of loaf sugar. The seasoning of 
vanilla depends upon the strength of the 
extract; generally it takes two teaspoon- 
fuls of the extract to flavor one quart of 
cream. If a good bean is cut up and macer- 
ated in six tablespoonfuls of brandy it takes 

(/72) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about four tablespoonfuls to flavor two 
quarts of cream. 

WINE. 

To two quarts of pure, rich cream put one 
pint of good Madeira wine and one pound 
six ounces of pounded loaf sugar; have the 
cream in the freezer and on the ice before 
you put in the wine. Whip it to a froth 
with a whip, and chum.

Pie crust for chicken pies, oysters, etc., is 
made with ten ounces of butter and lard 
to a quart of flour. The best pastry is made 
in cold weather. Even in the Winter pastry 
should never be made in the kitchen, but ' 
always in the pantry or some cool room. 

RHUBARB FOR PIES. 

Take the stem of the pieplant (rhubarb), 
strip off the thin skin, and cut into pieces 
the size of a gooseberry. Stir in sugar to 
suit the taste, three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to one of fruit should make it sweet

enough. Season with fresh lemon. Some 
stew the fruit before putting it on the paste ; 
it is better, however, to put it on the paste 
before stewing. Water is unnecessary, as 
a sugar seasoning extracts enough juice. It 
is thought to be better not to strip off the 
skins.

DRINKS 



DRINKS 

COFFEE. 

Take good Mocha or Java coffee, pick out 
any trash that may be in it, blow off the 
dust, toast it a good brown, turning it (if 
in a toaster) or stirring it (if in a skillet) 
constantly until it is done. Then grind it, 
pour it in the coffee pot, and pour on boil- 
ing water. Set it on the fire and let it boil 
fifteen minutes. Half a pint of toasted un- 
ground coffee will make three pints of 
coffee, that is, put that quantity of water 
to that measure of coffee. Put a teaspoon- 
ful of the white of egg in the coffee after 
putting it in the boiler; pour on two or 
three tablespoonfuls of cold water and mix 
the egg, coffee, and water together. 

CORDIAL, BLACKBERRY. 

To one gallon of the juice of ripe black- 
berries put two and a half pounds of loaf 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

sugar. Cook in a preserve kettle twenty 
minutes; five minutes before it is done, 
put in a very little allspice, mace» and 
cloves, pounded fine. As soon as it is cold 
add one pint of the best old rye whiskey; 
put into bottles, cork tight, and seal with 
beeswax. If you wish it to keep, put in one 
quart of whiskey and three and a half pounds 
of sugar; if brown sugar is used instead 
of loaf, use one quarter of a pound more 
to the pound. 

CORDIAL, RASPBERRY. 

Mix five oimces of Tartaric acid to two 
quarts of water, pour this on twelve pounds 
of raspberries and let it stand twenty-four 
hours; then press the fruit and strain the 
juree through a muslin cloth. To every pint 
of juice put one pound four oimces of loaf 
sugar. Bottle the juice and seal up the 
bottles. It is best to use this cordial the 
Summer it is made, although it will keep 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

twelve months. Blackberry cordial may be 
made in the same manner. 

EGGNOG. 

Take one quart of rich milk, one dozen 
large hen eggs, one quarter of a pint of good 
Jamaica rum, and three-fourths of a pint of 
the best whiskey; sweeten to the taste with 
loaf sugar. Beat the yolks until they are as 
light as beating can make them, and add the 
sugar; pour on the rum and whiskey (mixed) 
very slowly, beating the eggs all the time, 
so they will be thoroughly cooked. Now 
stir in the milk and, last of all, stir in one 
pint of whipped cream. 

GINGER POP. 

One ounce of ginger, one pound of j^rown 
sugar, one lemon, and one tablespoonful of 
hot yeast to one gallon of water. Break 
the ginger up fine, but not into a tartar; 
add it to the rind of the lemon and the 
sugar and pour the water, boiling hot, upon 

it 87) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

these ingredients. When cold add the yeast« 
Cover the jar and let it stand ten or twelve 
hours, then add the juice of the lemon and 
strain the whole. Bottle it» corking very 
tight, and tie the corks. Lay the bottles on 
one side in a tolerably warm place. The 
third or foiurth day they will be fit for use; 
then put them on ice. Do not fill the bottles 
quite up to the neck. 

TEA. 

For making green tea take the purest of 
spring water and boil in the cleanest of 
kettles; the moment the water commences 
to boil take it off the fire and make the tea 
immediately. It should be made in china 
or fine earthenware vessels (it will not draw 
well in a metal pot), and set on a heater 
for ten minutes, not longer. If it is winter 
set the teapot by the fire. One teaspoon 
heaped as full as it can be taken up will 
make two cups (or two-thirds of a pint) of 
strong tea. 

it 88) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

For making black tea take the same quan- 
tity of tea to the same quantity of water. 
Take the water when it has just commenced 
boiling, pour it on the tea, and pour the 
whole into a saucepan lined with porcelain 
and let it boil ten minutes, with the sauce- 
pan covered. 

There is no rule for telling good tea; it 
must be tasted to find out the flavor. Good 
green tea is a dark amber color. 

WINE, BLACKBERRY. 

Gather good ripe blackberries or dewber- 
ries, mash and strain them; to every gallon 
of juice put one quart of water and four 
pounds of brown sugar! Let it stand thirty- 
six hours, stirring occasionally and skim- 
ming off the scum that rises. Then put it 
in a cask or demijohn, putting in the cork 
loosely, and let it stand until the first of 
November. Then pour it off and bottle it. 
Cork the bottles tightly and keep them in 
a dry cellar. 

{189) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

WINE. CURRANT. 

Gather perfectly ripe currants with the 
stems on, mash them well with the hand, 
and add to each gallon of currants one quart 
of water. Strain through a strong muslin 
cloth or hair sifter and add three poimds 
of brown sugar to a gallon of the strained 
liquor. Put in a clean cask or demijohn 
and put in the cork or bung lightly. Set 
it in a moderately warm place and after it 
has fermented make the bung or cork tight. 
About the last of October or first of Novem- 
ber pour or draw the wine off carefully, and 
to five gallons put a quart of good French 
brandy. Bottle the wine, cork and seal the 
bottles and set them away in a dry cellar. 

» W 

PUNCH — "FISH HOUSE." 

Take two quarts of Jamaica rum, one 
quart of French brandy, one quart of lemon 
juice, four gills of peach brandy, two pounds 
of loaf sugar, and fifteen potmds of ice. Add 
as much water as there are quarts of liquor

— the ice will make up the rest, enough for 
about fifty people. 

This recipe was presented to Colonel 
Floyd Jones, of the Army, by the famous 
" Fish House " Club in Philadelphia. It has 
been in use since 1530.

NOTE 



JANE HAMILTON, who was married to 
John Marye, of Fredericksburg, Virginia, 
was the youngest child of George Hamilton 
of "Forest Hill," the Hamilton home near 
Fredericksburg, which was burned during the 
Civil War. 

As far as is known the recipes contained in 
this little book have, up to the present time, 
never been in print. They were originally 
collected and for many years used by Jane 
Hamilton's mother, at "Forest Hill," and 
the faded leaves upon which they were pre- 
served written out in script half a century 
ago have been in the possession of Mrs. 
Poindexter since the death of her mother, 
Susan Gibbon Thornton Mason, who was 
Jane Hamilton's niece. 

These recipes, while not covering the vari- 
ety of so-called "good things to eat" included 

O) 






NOTE 

in most modern cook-books, stood in very 
good stead of the " modern " cook-book 
during the period when, as is well known, 
"Virginia hospitality' meant very good 
things to eat. They have been tried by rep- 
resentative housewives of several genera- 
tions and the thoroughness of the test has 
necessarily limited the number now handed 
down ; but by those who have used them, 
they have been found sufficient and in every 
way satisfactory. They have already at- 
tracted attention in army circles, where they 
are known and where superior cooking is 
also appreciated. A good deal of butter and 
cream is called for, and a good many eggs, 
but this is doubtless a part of the secret why 
Virginia cooking is so noted.

SOUPS 



JANE HAMILTON'S 
RECIPES 



SOUPS 

ASPARAGUS. 

Take a chicken, or about two pounds of 
good veal or lamb, and put it on in sufficient 
water to make the soup. Cut into slices 
about half an inch thick some fresh aspara- 
gus. To make two quarts of soup take three- 
quarters of a quart of sliced asparagus. 
When the meat and asparagus are done, or 
about ten minutes before serving up the 
soup, add a little thickening, a pint of rich 
milk, a large slice of butter, and season with 
salt and black pepper. 

999 

BEEF. 

Take the shin of a hind quarter of fat 
beef, break the bone in two or three places, 
and put it on with a sufficient quantity of 
water six hours before dinner. Keep it 

(13) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

boiling constantly. About two hours before 
dinner take a good head of cabbage, strip 
off the outer leaves and cut it all into shreds 
except the stalk, then put it in the soup. 
Take six small turnips, cut them into little 
pieces and add to the soup. About fifteen 
minutes before dinner put in a very little 
thickening and season with salt and black 
pepper. This will make four quarts of rich 
soup. 

Another way of making beef soup is to 
take about four pounds of good beef, cut it 
into little pieces, and put it on in water suffi- 
cient to make two quarts of soup. Boil for 
about four hours. Thicken with brown flour, 
add the salt and black pepper, and season 
with thyme ; or a large silver onion chopped 
fine and two tablespoonfuls of pounded all- 
spice and half a tablespoonful of powdered 
cloves. 

^^* 
BLACK. 

Take the neck and shanks of a fat veal and 
half a pound of fat bacon and boil them for 

(t4) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about three hours. Then add the following 
ingredients for seasoning : two large onions, 
chopped fine; three tablespoonfuls of all- 
spice. Beat very fine a little thickening, and 
salt and pepper to your taste. Let it boil 
until the onion is done. This will make two 
quarts of good soup. The meat when it is 
cooked enough to separate from the bone is 
taken off and cut up into little pieces and 
boiled to shreds in the soup. Take out the 
bacon when the soup is served up. 



CATFISH CHOWDER. 

Take as many catfish as will weigh three 
pounds. Put about a pound of fat bacon on 
the fire with as much water as will be suffi- 
cient for the chowder. Put this on two hours 
before dinner. Dip the fish in hot water and 
take off the skin; then put them back on 
the fire in the pot with the bacon, after cut- 
ting them into small pieces, and boil them 
until they are done. Then take out every 
bone and add two large onions, chopped 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

very fine, a little thickening, and season with 
salt and pepper. As soon as the onion is 
done, add half a pint of milk with the yolks 
of two eggs beat up and stirred in it, and a 
large slice of butter. Parsley is thought by 
some to be an improvement to the chowder. 
As soon as the milk, eggs, and butter are 
stirred in serve up the chowder. Chowder 
is very good made without the eggs and milk 
and with a rather large piece of bacon cut 
into little pieces. The above will make two 
quarts of good chowder. 






DRIED PEA. 

Take a pint of the small white peas, wash 
them well and soak them for an hour or two, 
then put them on to boil in sufficient water 
to make two quarts of soup, with a slice of 
nice fat bacon. When it has boiled between 
two and three hours strain the soup through 
a fine colander and add a large slice of 
butter, a little thickening, and season with 
salt and pepper. Dried Lima beans or the 

(16) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

common white bean make nearly as good 
soup as the small white pea. 

9 9 

GREEN PEA. 

Put on the fire in an iron pot a large fat 
chicken and a slice of bacon, in water suffi- 
cient to make two quarts of soup, two hours 
before dinner. After boiling for about an 
hour put in two quarts of green peas. About 
ten or fifteen minutes before dinner strain 
the soup through a fine colander and add 
a very little thickening, salt, and black 
pepper. Some persons like the soup thin- 
ner than this quantity of peas will make it. 
This soup may be made with bacon, with- 
out the chicken, but it is not so good. 

$ 

MOCK TURTLE. 

Clean head in the usual manner, by scrap- 
ing off the hair, and split in two, taking 
out the brains. Boil the head until it is 
perfectly tender. Then take it out of the 
water, separate it from the bones and hard 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

part inside the mouth and the gristle of the 
ears, cut the tongue and other parts into 
small pieces, and put the meat back into the 
pot. The soup will be much improved by 
adding at this time two or three pounds of 
fat veal cut into little pieces. Boil steadily; 
half an hour before serving up the soup 
add two large silver onions chopped fine, 
thyme, parsley, a teaspoonful of pounded 
mace, the same of cloves, salt, and red 
pepper to the taste. Thicken the soup v/ith 
browned flour and add a quarter of a pound 
of good butter. Just before serving up the 
soup season with Madeira wine to the taste. 
The above will make three quarts of rich 
soup. The brains must be made into little 
thin cakes, fried, and put into the tureen 
just before pouring in the soup, or on top 
of the soup after pouring it in. 



MUTTON SOUP A LA SQUIRREL. 

Take the neck and shanks of a fat mut- 
ton, cleansing them properly, or three pounds 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

of good mutton. Put it on to boil about 
four hours before dinner in water sufficient 
to make two quarts of soup. About twenty 
minutes before dinner cut up and put in the 
soup a large silver onion, season with salt 
and black pepper, and ten minutes before 
serving up the soup put in a very little 
thickening. Lamb soup may be made in 
the same manner, but lamb not being such 
fat meat as mutton requires more meat to 
make the soup as rich. 



OKRA. 

Take a large fat chicken, or two pounds 
of fresh, fat veal or lamb, and put it on the 
fire with about a pound of good fat bacon 
in plenty of water. Put it on about four 
hours before dinner. After it has boiled 
between two and three hours, put in three 
quarts of fine sliced okra, a quart of peeled 
tomatoes, and four carrots sliced very fine. 
About twenty minutes before serving up the 
soup, cut up and put in two large onions, 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

a very little thickening, salt and red pepper 
to the taste. It takes two large pods of red 
pepper to make the soup hot. This will 
make four quarts of very fine soup. Some 
persons prefer this soup without the toma- 
toes and carrots. 



OKRA GUMBO. 

Take a chicken, cut it into pieces, dust 
them with flour, put a large spoonful of 
good butter in a frying pan with a slice of 
good ham, put in the chicken and let it fry 
to a light brown. Add the okra and let it 
fry a short time (the okra is cut in slices 
a quarter of an inch thick), then put in 
enough warm water to make two quarts of 
soup, a large silver onion chopped fine and 
fried. Let it boil until a few minutes before 
dinner, then thicken with browned flour and 
season with salt and red and black pepper. 



OYSTER. 

Wash the oysters well, first in the liquor, 
then in a little water; add the water to the 

(20) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

liquor, strain it through a cloth, and pour 
it back on the oysters. Put the oysters over 
the fire and let them stew five minutes, then 
put into two quarts of oysters, one quart 
of milk, six ounces of butter, and a large 
slice of loaf bread cut in little squares. Sea- 
son with salt and black pepper and let all 
stew twenty minutes from the time you put 
them on the fire. You may leave out the 
slice of loaf bread. 

If you like the soup rich, you must put 
in more than six ounces of butter. If you 
get good, living oysters they may be kept 
in a cellar four or five weeks and fatten. 
Place the oysters with their mouths or shells 
up, and feed once a day with water made 
slightly brackish or water to which a little 
meal has been added.

Take one chicken, one pound of lean beef, 
and a slice of fat ham, cut them into pieces, 
dust them with flour, and fry a light brown

with some good, fresh butter. Then pour 
on sufficient warm water to make about two 
quarts of soup. Add a large silver onion 
(some fry the onion). Let all boil until half 
,an hour before dinner, then add from a 
quart to half a gallon of oysters well drained, 
some thyme and parsley tied in a bunch, 
and season with black pepper and salt. Just 
before you pour it into the tureen, after it 
is off of the fire, sprinkle in the fillet until 
it is as thick as you like, stirring it well. 
The above will make from three to four 
quarts of soup.

SALSIFY. 

Scrape the salsify and wash it, boil it until 
it is nearly done, then cut it into very thin 
slices and put it back in the water in which 
it was boiled. Take about three-quarters 
of a quart of this sliced salsify, a pint of 
cream, a large slice of butter, a little thick- 
ening, and season with salt and pepper. The 
soup is nicer if about half of the salsify is 
mashed up.

TOMATO. 

Take a good large chicken, put it in suf- 
ficient water to make two quarts of soup; 
after it has boiled about an hour put in two 
dozen large tomatoes, and let them boil about 
fifteen minutes before serving up the soup. 
Strain the soup through a colander and put 
in a pint of cream, a large spoonful of butter, 
two of brown sugar, a little thickening, two 
onions chopped very fine, and salt and black 
pepper to the taste. Toast some bread nicely, 
cut it into small pieces, and put it in the 
tureen, pour the soup over it, and serve 
it up. 



TURKEY AND CHICKEN. 

Turkey soup may be made from the bones 
of a cold roast turkey with the addition of 
about half a pound of nice fat bacon, but 
the nicest soup is made from the water in 
which a turkey is boiled. After the turkey 
is cooked sufficiently, take it out and skim 
off the oily particles to dress the turkey 

(23)

with they spoil the soup if allowed to re- 
main. Then add a little thickening, salt, 
and half a pint of rich milk. Some persons 
like rice in this soup, in which case the rice 
must be boiled in the soup before the turkey 
is taken out. If the turkey is not very fat 
put half a pound of good fat bacon on with 
the turkey, to make the soup rich enough. 
Two quarts of very fine soup can be made 
from a boiled turkey. 

Chicken soup is sometimes made from the 
water in which half-grown chickens are 
boiled, but the usual and best way is to take 
a large fat chicken and put it on in water 
sufficient to cover about two hours before 
dinner. You may put in a little rice if you 
choose. About fifteen or twenty minutes 
before serving up the soup put in a bunch 
of thyme to season it. Ten minutes before 
it is done add about a pint of rich cream, 
a little thickening, and season with salt and 
black pepper. The above will make two 
quarts of rich chicken soup.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

VEGETABLE. 

Take a slice of good fat ham and put it 
on to boil in water with some tender cym- 
blings and ears of corn, enough to make 
two quarts of soup; the quantity will de- 
pend upon the size of the cymblings and 
how thick you like the soup. V/hen the 
cymblings are done pass them through a 
sieve and return them into the pot in which 
they were boiled with the ham, cut off the 
corn carefully and put back with the cym- 
blings, etc. The corn may be cut off the 
cob before it is boiled and put in the soup. 
Put a little thickening in the soup, a pint 
of cream, a slice of butter, and season with 
salt and black pepper. This is for two 
quarts of soup. Four good ears of corn and 
three cymblings would be quite sufficient 
for this quantity of soup. 



VERMICELLI. 

Take a lar^e fat chicken, or about two 
pounds of veal or lamb, and two or three 

(25) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

slices of fat ham; the chicken should be cut 
in pieces, the lamb or veal in small slices, 
and put on to boil in sufficient cold water; 
let it boil until the meat is boiled to shreds. 
About half an hour before the soup is done, 
wash well in cold water one and a half or 
two ounces of vermicelli, and put it in the 
soup with some thyme tied in a bunch. 
Season with salt and black pepper. You 
do not put any thickening in this soup. The 
above will make two quarts of rich soup. 
Color the soup a rich brown with burnt 
sugar.

FISH 




FISH 

HERRING, HOW TO PUT UP. 

Cleanse the herrings properly, if they 
have any mud on them they must be washed, 
and then souse them, that is, pack them 
lightly in salt for three or four days. They 
must be pressed down by heavy weights to 
keep them under the brine, which is formed 
by the juice of the herrings and salt. At the 
end of three or, at the most, four days, take 
the herrings out and pack them in Turk 
Island salt, or a mixture of ground alum 
salt pounded and Liverpool salt. Pack them 
closely in oak or cypress barrels, oak is 
perhaps the best. A molasses barrel is very 
good for packing in. The herrings in pack- 
ing are always placed on the back; pack 
the first row from left to right, the next 
row pack from you so as to make the her- 
rings cross each other at right angles, and 

(29) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

continue so throughout the barrel. After 
the barrels are packed full, take half a pound 
of pounded saltpetre and mix with three 
quarts or a gallon of molasses; pour this 
quantity over a barrel of fish and then head 
up the barrel. Before the barrel is headed 
put a proper weight on the herrings, bore 
a hole in the top of the barrel and pour in 
some strong brine. It is necessary that the 
fish should be covered by brine ; if they are 
not they will not be good. A full gallon 
of molasses is more than enough for a barrel 
of herrings. Soak the herrings in cold water 
two or three hours and then hang them up, 
letting them dry perfectly before boiling.

OYSTER PIE. 

To make an oyster pie, take two quarts 
of oysters, put them on the fire with six 
ounces of butter, and let them stay just long 
enough to melt the butter, season with salt 
and black pepper, and add half a pint of 
milk or cream and a large slice of loaf bread 

(.30) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cut into small pieces. Have a dish prepared 
with paste around the sides, pour in the 
oysters, and bake.

OYSTERS, FRIED. 

To fry oysters, after the oysters have been 
washed and the liquor strained, without 
any water being put in it, make a batter 
of flour^eggs, and some of the oyster liquor, 
put in enough salt and black pepper to sea- 
son the oysters, dip the oysters separately 
into the batter, and then put them into the 
frying-pan, which should be of the right 
heat with plenty of good lard in it. 

3T v 

OYSTERS, SCALLOPED. 

To scallop oysters, after they have been 
washed, etc., put each large oyster in a shell 
with some crumbled roll, a little salt, black 
pepper, and butter, and bake them in an 
oven. Put a little oyster liquor in each shell. 
Oysters may be boiled and toasted. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

OYSTERS, STEWED. 

Wash the oysters carefully in the liquor, 
then wash them in a little water; take the 
oysters out, add the water to the liquor, 
strain the whole through a thin cloth, and 
pour back on the oysters. Put them on the 
fire in an iron pot or vessel, and let them 
stew for fifteen or twenty minutes; if you 
like them cooked it takes twenty minutes. 
To one gallon of oysters put three-quarters 
of a pound of good butter and about one 
pint of milk or cream and season with salt 
and black pepper. Some persons think it 
better not to put the butter in until five 
minutes before serving up the oysters. 



STURGEON. 

Wash and cleanse the sturgeon properly, 
then parboil it and set it in a dish on the 
ice to use as you want it. If it is to be 
fried, cut it in slices about an inch thick; 
dip the slices in flour, put in salt and black 
pepper, and lay them in the frying-pan, 

(32) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

which should be of the proper heat, with 
some good lard in it for frying. When 
nearly done, put in a little flour; as soon 
as it is brown, add a little water for gravy. 
If the sturgeon is to be baked, rub a little 
salt on it and put it in an oven with some 
water ; a piece of sturgeon four inches thick 
is a nice size for baking. When the stur- 
geon is about half done, sprinkle flour all 
over it and add a large slice of butter ; when 
it is nearly done mix a little flour in a batter 
and stir it in the water and essence in which 
the sturgeon is baking to make the gravy, 
and put a sufficient seasoning of black pepper 
on the sturgeon. When the gravy is done, 
serve it up.

MEATS 



MEATS 

BAKED VEAL, LAMB, 

MUTTON, CHICKEN. 

Have the meats properly cleansed, wash 
them, rub salt on them, and put them in the 
oven with sufficient water, say about three 
pints of water to a hind quarter of veal, a 
quart to a quarter of lamb or shoulder of 
mutton, less to chickens or ducks. The 
length of time it takes to bake a hind quar- 
ter of lamb of about ten pounds' weight is 
about two hours; veal of about ten pounds' 
weight, about two hours and a half; an or- 
dinary sized shoulder of mutton takes about 
an hour and a half; ducks require about 
the same time; tender chickens will bake 
in half an hour. When chickens or ducks 
are baked, first see that they are prop- 
erly cleansed, then stuff them with stale 
loaf bread mixed with butter and highly 

(37) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

seasoned with salt and black pepper. Ducks 
are sometimes seasoned with onions. When 
any of these meats are nearly done sprinkle 
a little flour on them, so as to have them 
a nice brown. Chicken and veal, unless they 
are very fat, require something to dress 
them with. Good sweet lard answers bet- 
ter for the veal than butter. The chickens 
require either butter or good fat bacon. 

About ten minutes before the meat is 
done, make up some batter and stir it in 
the water and juice in which the meat is 
baking, season the gravy with salt and black 
pepper, and also sprinkle black pepper on 
the meat. Veal and chicken require more 
than any other meat. Ducks and chickens 
should be killed the day before they are to 
be cooked. First pick off the feathers and 
cleanse them, then put them in salt water 
an hour or two, then put them in a dish 
and set them on ice until you are ready to 
use them. All kinds of fowls should be 
well done; it is better to have them rather 
overdone than underdone. Veal should be 

(38) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cooked in the same manner. To frost veal 
or lamb mix flour and butter together and 
put over the meat just before sprinkling on 

flour. 

999 

BLACK STEW. 

Take eight or nine slices from a cold 
roasted saddle or loin of mutton. Put plenty 
of the cold gravy with it. Set on the fire in 
a skillet or in the oven with water enough 
to cover it well, about an hour and a half 
before dinner. About fifteen minutes be- 
fore dinner chop up and put in two silver 
onions of the usual size, one rounding table- 
spoonful of fine pounded allspice, enough to 
make the stew black, a little thickening, and 
season with salt and black pepper. Five 
minutes before serving up the stew, slice 
and put in a large pickled cucumber. Take 
out the slices of meat, lay them in a dish, 
and stir in the gravy a gill of currant jelly. 
Pour the gravy over the meat and serve 
it up.

BRAINS. 

Wash the brains well, and let them stand 
an hour in salt and water, then parboil them 
in water with a little salt in it. Beat two 
eggs well and add them to the brains of 
sixteen hogs, also beating in with the eggs 
about half a pint of flour or a little more, 
not less. After beating in the eggs and flour, 
season with salt and black pepper. Have 
a frying-pan with plenty of good sweet 
lard in it, drop in the batter by spoonfuls, 
fry to a light brown on one side, then turn 
and fry on the other. Half a pound of lard 
is an abundance to fry the above quantity 
of brains. There is a thin skin over the 
brains which should be taken off before they 
are boiled or, more properly, parboiled. 



CHICKEN, FRIAR'S. 

Take a full-grown fowl, an old hen will 
do very well. After it has baen properly 
cleaned and put in salt water for two or 
three hours and kept on ice for two or three 

(40) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

days, cut it into pieces, separating every 
limb, that is, cut the legs in two and the 
wings in three pieces, and separate the 
breast and side bones, etc. Put it into a 
suitable vessel with two quarts of water, 
cover it over, and let it boil for four hours. 
Add a little thickening, half a pint of rich 
milk, and season with salt and black pepper. 
If the fowl is poor stir a slice of butter and 
two eggs well beaten into the milk before 
that is put in. Thyme makes a good sea- 
soning for this dish. It is an improvement 
to bake this. 



CHICKEN, FRICASSEED. 

Take two well-grown, fat chickens that 
have been picked and cleaned, separate the 
wings, legs, breasts, etc., and lay them in 
salt and water for an hour or two. They 
may be cooked at once, but will be better 
if kept for twenty-four hours in a dish with 
a little salt sprinkled on them. When ready 
to cook them, wash them, dust them with 

(4t) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

flour, and sprinkle a little salt on them; put 
them in the oven with a quarter of a pound 
of good lard, let them fry until each piece 
is well browned ; then add a quart of water, 
cover it over and let it stew. About twenty 
minutes before the chicken is done cut up 
a large silver onion and put it in the gravy. 
Five or six minutes before serving up the 
chicken, make the yolks of two eggs into 
a batter and stir in the gravy, seasoning with 
black pepper. When the chicken is done 
lay it in a dish and stir in the gravy the 
whites of two eggs ; this will cook in a 
moment. Pour the gravy on the chicken 
and serve it up. 



: 



CHICKEN, FRIED. 

Prepare the chicken for frying in the same 
manner as for a fricassee, taking out the 
breast bone, which should be done also with 
the fricasseed chicken. Put four ounces of 
lard in a frying-pan of the right heat; dust 
the chicken with flour, and rub a little salt 

(42) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

on it. Put it in the pan and let it fry until 
it is a light brown. Have a half-pint of 
sifted meal made into a stiff mush, let it 
get entirely cold, cut it into cakes, and fry 
it a light brown. Also fry a little parsley 
into the chicken.

CORNED BEEF. <4f 

Cut up the beef about twelve hours after 
it has been killed, throw the pieces you wish 
corned into cold water, and let them remain 
for an hour or two. After dripping, rub it 
a little with salt, and then put it in the 
brine. The brine is made of Liverpool salt 
strong enough to bear an egg. Rub a tea- 
spoonful of saltpetre on every piece of beef 
except the tongue and the rounds, which 
should have double that quantity; the 
tongue should have only half a teaspoonful. 
The beef should always be entirely covered 
by the brine. It is generally necessary to 
put heavy stones on it to keep it under the 
brine. If you wish to keep corned beef for 

(43) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

spring use, take it out of the brine after it 
has been in for about four weeks and hang 
it up in the meat house to smoke. It gives 
the beef a good flavor to put some sugar in 
the brine, say two pounds of brown sugar 
to eight gallons of brine. Five teaspoon- 
fuls of saltpetre is equal to one ounce. 



FOWLS, BOILED WITH RICE. 

Take pullets or full-grown fowls that have 
been properly cleaned and stuffed and put 
them on to boil in boiling water, the length 
of time depending on the tenderness of the 
fowls, varying from three-quarters of an 
hour to two hours and a half. For two full- 
grown fowls take half a pound of rice, wash 
and boil it as for a vegetable soup. When 
it is done season it with salt and mix up 
a tablespoonful of flour with some cold water 
to make a thin batter, stir it in the rice, and 
let it stay on the fire until the batter is 
done, then stir in a large slice of butter. 

(44) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Put the fowls in a dish, cover them with 
the rice, and serve them up. 




FRENCH BEEFSTEAK. 

To prepare French beefsteak cut slices 
about an inch thick of uncooked beef from 
the steak part, dust them with flour, and 
sprinkle salt on them. Put them in an oven 
to fry with some shredded suet about five 
hours before dinner. After frying on both 
sides put in water enough to cover the meat 
well. Let it stew until dinner. About 
three-quarters of an hour before dinner put 
in some small silver onions and tolerably 
large potatoes; cook them until they are 
done. Ten minutes before serving up the 
steak put in some thickening and season 
with salt and black pepper. 



HAM, BOILED AND BAKED. 

The length of time for boiling a ham de- 
pends upon the size and age of the ham. A 

(45) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

ham of the usual size, say eleven or twelve 
pounds, and one that is only three or four 
months old, requires to be boiled about four 
hours. One a year old or more is boiled 
in about two and a half hours. An old ham 
should always be soaked in cold water five 
or six hours before boiling. Skim off the 
froth that rises to the top of the pot. A 
baked ham should never be more than six 
months old. After washing it properly boil 
it until it is half done, then lift it out of 
the pot, take off the skin, and put it in the 
oven to bake with sufficient water, about 
a quart. Take some stale rolls or loaf bread 
and crumble them; when the crumbs are 
put on, sprinkle the ham with flour and some 
black pepper ; moisten the bread with a little 
of the water in which the bacon has been 
boiled, and when the ham is nearly done 
cover it over with the bread thus prepared. 
The ham should be baked until it is tender. 
It is best served up cold.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

LAMB, BOILED. 

Take a fat hind quarter of lamb, wash it 
well, rub it with salt, and put it on to boil 
in a covered vessel in as much water as 
will cover it. It takes about two hours to 
boil a quarter weighing about ten pounds. 
Skim off the froth that rises to the top in 
boiling. When the lamb is nearly done, 
make a thick paste, season it with salt and 
stir in four ounces of butter and some pars- 
ley. This makes the gravy for the lamb. 
It may be seasoned with pickled cucumbers 
cut up in slices and stewed for a minute or 
two in the gravy, or with capers, leaving 
out the parsley. Put the lamb in a dish, 
pour the gravy over it, and cover. A leg 
of mutton may be dressed in the same 
manner. 



PORK A LA MODE. 

Take some good fat pork steaks, rub a 
little flour on them. Put them in an oven 
and let them fry on each side until they are 

(47) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about half done ; then pour on enough water 
to cover them and let them stew. Put in 
a fine chopped onion for seasoning. About 
five minutes before serving up the dish sea- 
son with salt and black pepper and put in 
some thickening; then add an equal quan- 
tity of vinegar and sugar, enough to flavor 
the dish well, and just enough fine pounded 
allspice to make the stew black. The meat 
must be stewed until it is as tender as 
chicken. 



ROASTED MUTTON, BEEF, 

LAMB, TURKEY. 

The time for roasting a sirloin of beef, or 
a turkey of the ordinary size, is about two 
hours; a saddle of mutton from two to two 
and a half hours; a quarter of lamb from 
two and a half to three hours. The longer 
a saddle of mutton can be kept perfectly 
sweet, from the time it is butchered until 
it is cooked, the finer flavored and more ten- 
der it becomes. Wrapped in a linen cloth and 

(48) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

laid on the ice, it can be kept upwards of 
four weeks. Beef is also more tender after 
it has been kept a while buried in the ice. 
Before cooking the meats wash them well, 
and rub salt on them. Suspend by a cord 
fastened to the spit and then secured in a 
hook over the fireplace before a large fire, 
and turn the meat every minute or two. Put 
a dripping-pan underneath to catch the juice 
of the meat. About fifteen minutes before 
the meats are done, take the juice from the 
dripping-pan, put it in a skillet (if the 
dripping-pan is very hot, put in a little 
water to prevent the juice from burning), 
mix some flour in a very thin batter, and 
stir it in the gravy to thicken it. Let it 
stew until the meat is done. Ten minutes 
before serving up the meat sprinkle a little 
flour on it and turn constantly, so as to 
have it a light brown. The turkey should 
not have any flour sprinkled on it. If the 
turkey is poor, baste it with a little butter 
or a few thin slices of fat bacon; stuff the 
turkey with stale bread mixed with butter, 

(49) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

salt, and pepper. Tie the wings close to its 
side. 



SPICED ROUND OF BEEF. 

Take one ounce of black pepper, half an 
ounce of cloves, the same of allspice, pound 
these spices, add one grated nutmeg, one 
ounce of saltpetre, and two handfuls of salt. 
Rub the beef with about half a pint of mo- 
lasses, then with the spices, salt, etc. Put 
it in an earthen dish and rub it with the 
hand every morning and turn it. It may 
be cooked in a fortnight or it may be kept 
six weeks. Stew or bake it in an oven or 
a pot with beef suet shredded fine over it. 
Add a quart of water and a pint of port or 
claret wine. It must be done slowly, taking 
care to keep all the steam in. It will re- 
quire three or four hours to get it perfectly 
done, or perhaps five hours, according to 
the size of the round.

TRIPE. 

After the tripe has been well washed, it 
is put in hot water and scraped until all the 
coarse, hard substance which adheres to it 
is taken off. Soak it in cold water for ten 
or twelve hours ; then scrape it again, wash 
it well, and put it in weak salt water. Let 
it remain in salt water four days, changing 
the water every day; then boil it. After it 
is boiled put it in salt water to remain as 
long as it is desired to keep it. The length 
of time it may be kept depends upon the 
coldness of the weather. When you wish 
to serve it up, if it is to be stewed, put it 
on with water enough to cover it, in slices 
about three inches square, and let it stew 
until it is perfectly tender. Add a little 
thickening and salt and half a pint of milk 
or cream to a dish of the usual size. To 
prepare onion sauce for this dish, cut up 
some silver onions and put them on the fire 
in a saucepan with a little water, then add 
a spoonful of flour, enough to make a thin 
batter, season with salt, and put in a large 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

slice of butter just before serving up the 
sauce. If you like the tripe fried, cut it 
in slices as you do for stewing, dip the slices 
in a batter made of eggs, flour, and v/ater 
or milk and put them in a frying-pan, which 
should be properly heated and have suffi- 
cient lard in it. The thickest parts of the 
tripe are the best. 



TURKEY, BOILED. 

Put an old turkey hen on to boil about 
two hours, not longer, before dinner, in as 
much water as will cover it. Tie the wings 
to the sides. As the water boils down, 
leaving the turkey uncovered, it must be 
turned occasionally, so that each part of 
it may be equally done. Salt to season. 
About ten or fifteen minutes before the tur- 
key is done, take half a dozen hard-boiled 
eggs, cut them up fine, put them in a skillet 
with a pint of cold water, put the skillet 
on the fire, and let the eggs and water stew 
thoroughly ; stir in about a gill of flour with 

(52) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

the eggs and water before you put them 
over the fire instead of afterward. Season 
with salt, skim off the oily particles that 
rise to the surface of the water in which 
the turkey has been boiled, and put with 
the egg sauce, and just before taking the 
sauce off the fire stir in a large slice of 
butter. Dress the turkey with the sauce 
and serve it up. The turkey is prepared 
for boiling or roasting by being first well 
washed, then stuffed with stale loaf bread 
mixed with butter and highly seasoned with 
black pepper and salt. The wings should 
be tied close to the sides with a strong 
string. Pullets and hens are boiled and 
dressed with egg sauce in the same manner. 
A young turkey takes barely an hour to 
boil; hens only are boiled. 



VEAL'S HEAD. 

Dip the head in hot water, and scrape it 
until every hair is taken off, then put it on 
to boil in water sufficient to cover it. When 
it is parboiled take it off the fire, take out 

(53) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

every bone, and the hard whitish substance 
inside the mouth. It may be kept in a cov- 
ered vessel on the ice for several days in 
the liquor in which it was boiled; when it 
is to be served up put it on the fire and let 
it boil until it is perfectly done, and the 
liquor in which it was first boiled is brought 
down to a proper consistency. Put in a 
little thickening, four ounces of butter, and 
season with salt and pepper. The ears and 
eyes are left whole, the tongue is sliced. 
Take out the brains before you stew the 
head a second time, and make them, with 
bread, butter, salt, pepper, and thyme, into 
little balls and fry them. Also fry little 
pieces of pastry cut into shapes and put 
them on top of the head after it is baked. 
When the head has been seasoned put it into 
a deep dish with a nice paste around the edge, 
and bake it. When it is done put the little 
pieces of fried pastry and forced meat balls 
on top of the dish and serve it up. Some 
persons dress the head with hard-boiled eggs.

BEETS. 

Wash the beets well and put them on in 
cold water. When they are done pour them 
into a colander to drain off the water; then 
take off the skins and serve them up whole, 
or sliced, with an abundance of butter over 
them. To scrape the skins off beets before 
boiling, as with salsify and parsnips, spoil 
them, as they are more tender than those 

vegetables.

CABBAGE PUDDING. 

Get a large, well-flowered head of cabbage. 
Take off the outer leaves ; cut out the inner 
top part, take about half a pound of fat

tie it up in a cloth, and boil it for four 
hours. When the cabbage is served up cover 
it with drawn butter. 

To make drawn butter, mix a rather thick 
paste, and to every gill of paste stir in while 
it is hot five or six ounces of good fresh 
butter. Put on in boiling v/ater. 



CORN FRITTERS. 

Take a dozen large ears of tender green 
corn, cut the kernels off the cob, taking care 
first to pull out all the silk and to lose 
none of the juice or milk of the corn. Beat 
up six eggs and add them to the corn, sea- 
son with salt and black pepper, and then 
drop in spoonfuls into a frying-pan and fry 
on one side, then turn and fry on the other.

CORN PUDDING. 

f- -- - -- --" 

Boil a dozen ears of corn until they are 
half done; then cut the corn from the cob, 
taking care not to let any of the husk be 
mixed with it. To this quantity of corn put 
a quart of rich cream, six or eight ounces 
of butter, and season with salt and black 
pepper. It is well to beat the corn in a 
wooden tray with a wooden beater. The 
butter and cream are put in and well mixed 
with the corn, and the whole then put in 
a dish and baked. Some cooks put eggs in 
their pudding, say four eggs to one dozen 
ears of corn. Some think it best not to boil 
the corn for this pudding. 



CUCUMBERS, STEWED. 

Peel the cucumbers, cut them up, and put 
them in a skillet in sufficient water to cover 
them. Cut up a silver onion and add for 
seasoning. When they are done mash them 
up, season with salt and black pepper, and 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

add a slice of butter. They are about the 
consistency of cymblings. 



CYMBLINGS. 

First boil the cymblings until they are 
done, then mash them and pass them 
through a sieve; put them in a skillet with 
a pint of cream to about a quart of cym- 
blings, season with salt and black pepper, 
and let them stew until the cymblings are 
dry enough, say for about ten minutes. Stir 
in a large slice of butter and serve them 
up.

EGG-PLANT. 

Boil the egg-plant until it is done, or soft 
enough to mash it to a pulp; then take off 
the skin, mash it, season with salt and 
pepper, and make it into cakes about half 
an inch thick. Make a batter of two eggs, 
flour, and a little milk, dip the cakes in it, 
and put them in a frying-pan, which should 
be of the right heat, with plenty of lard in 

(60) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

it. Fry them to a light brown on one side, 
then turn and fry to a brown on the other. 

To bake egg-plant, after boiling and mash- 
ing it season with salt and black pepper and 
stir in a little cream and a good slice of 
butter in a dish of an ordinary size, also 
some grated stale bread. Cut it in slices a 
third of an inch thick, grate a little stale 
bread over them, season with salt and pep- 
per, and fry them. 



EGGS A LA CREAM. 

Rub a little flour and fresh butter together, 
add a little salt and pepper and one pint 
of cream, and one fried onion and parsley, 
cut up and stewed together two or three 
minutes. Take twelve hard-boiled eggs and 
cut in slices ; grate some stale bread, a little 
over a pint when grated ; put in a deep dish, 
taking a layer of crumbs and a layer of eggs 
until all are in the dish, a layer of crumbs 
on the top; season with pepper and salt; 
pour in on each layer the stewed cream; 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

bake in the oven with a quick heat until 
a light brown. 



HOMINY, BOILED. 

Take. two quarts of hominy and pour on 
it four quarts of cold water the night before 
you intend boiling it, and let it soak until 
the next morning; or put it in soak six or 
eight hours before boiling it. Put it on to 
boil in an iron pot in the same water in 
which it has been soaked, adding eight 
quarts of cold water. When it commences 
to boil, or after it has boiled a few minutes, 
skim off the foam that rises to the top. Let 
the hominy boil for three and a half hours 
in a covered vessel. If it boils over and it 
should be necessary to add more water, the 
water that is added must be boiling. The 
above quantity of water is sufficient for boil- 
ing the hominy unless it boils over or the 
pot is left uncovered. It must not be al- 
lowed to stop boiling for one moment, or 
it will take longer than three hours and a 

(62) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

half; when the hominy is done it is almost 
dry. It should be taken out of the pot and 
beaten in a wooden tray with a strong 
wooden beater. It may be served up hot 
with an abundance of butter, or it may be 
put away to get cold for frying. When it 
is to be fried put it in an iron vessel and 
make hot; put in a slice of butter and salt 
sufficient to season; have a frying-pan 
heated with a sufficient quantity of lard in 
it, put in the hominy and fry to a light 
brown. Boiled hominy should be kept in 
a cool place. It will keep for four or five 
days in cool weather. Before the hominy 
is put to soak preparatory to boiling, it 
must be well washed in cold water. If al- 
lowed to stand for a few minutes in the 
water in which it is washed, the impurities 
will rise to the top, and may be easily 
poured off with the water. If the hominy 
is rather too stiff or dry, when you fry it 
put in some cream instead of butter. Cream 
put in the boiled hominy with the butter 
is very good.

MACARONI. 

Take half a pound of macaroni and soak 
it in cold water for half an hour. Boil it 
for about an hour, not longer. Then spread 
layers of macaroni in the dish with butter 
and grated cheese between. Also put in a 
little mustard and season highly with salt 
and black pepper. Put half a pound of 
cheese and six ounces of butter to half a 
pound of macaroni. Bake for about half 
an hour. Macaroni may be boiled in milk 
and served up without baking.

MUSHROOMS. 

Take the fresh-gathered mushrooms, re- 
move the stems, and peel off the top skin. 
Wash them and put them on to stew in a 
stewpan either brass- or porcelain-lined. 
Put very little water with them; let them 
stew for an hour or until they are entirely 
done, season with salt and black pepper, 
and put in plenty of butter. Another way 
of cooking mushrooms is to broil them. For 

(64) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

this purpose select the largest, peel them 
and take off the stem, put salt and pepper 
on them, and dip them in melted butter. 
Take them off the gridiron once or twice 
while they are broiling and dip them in 
butter. Take a silver spoon and stir up the 
mushrooms; if there is one amongst them 
that is not good, it will turn the spoon 
dark.

ONIONS, STEWED. 

Peel the onions (the silver onion is the 
best for every purpose), chop them up and 
put them in the skillet with nearly a quart 
of water to a quart of chopped onions ; stew 
them in a covered vessel for about half an 
hour or until they are done. When they are 
half done stir in a teaspoonful of flour and 
one of sugar and season with salt, and just 
before serving them up add a large slice of 
butter.

POTATOES, BOILED. 

The most wholesome and most palatable 
way of cooking Irish potatoes is to boil 
them. The proper mode of boiling them, 
and the exact length of time it takes to cook 
them sufficiently, cannot be well known but 
by practice, though some general directions 
may be given. The potatoes just dug re- 
quire a shorter time for boiling than those 
which have been out of the ground for sev- 
eral weeks. Large potatoes, of course, take 
a rather longer time for boiling than small 
ones. Take some potatoes that have been 
out of the ground for several weeks, choose 
them of the same size, say such as will 
weigh six ounces, put them in a pot of cold 
water with a tablespoonful of salt for a 
dozen potatoes, and boil them from twenty- 
five minutes to half an hour. Then pour 
the potatoes into a colander so as to drain 
off every drop of water, return the water 
to the pot in v/hich the potatoes were boiled 
and set the colander with the potatoes over 
it; set them on the fire and let the potatoes 

(66) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

steam for one or two minutes, then skin 
them, put them in a heated dish, cover them 
over and serve them up immediately. In 
putting the potatoes on to boil always have 
water enough to allow for evaporation and 
yet to leave enough to cover the potatoes 
until they are done. When the potatoes are 
small and indifferent mash them and beat 
them up with half a pint of cream to a dish 
of the ordinary size, that is, to between two 
and three pounds of potatoes. They are 
very good baked after being mashed and the 
cream put in them. Fried potatoes may 
have milk put in them, but much less of 
it. Make them into cakes about an inch 
thick. Summer potatoes, just dug out of 
the ground, may be boiled in twenty min- 
utes' time. Mashed, fried, and baked pota- 
toes are always seasoned with salt. 




RICE, BOILED. 

Take half a pound of rice, wash it well, 
put with it one quart and three-quarters of 

(67) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cold water, and let it soak for two hours; 
then boil it in the same water in which it 
has been soaking. It should be boiled in 
the clearest of vessels; cover the vessel in 
which you cook it and let it boil twenty 
minutes with the cover on, then take off 
the cover and let it simmer until the re- 
maining water is sufficiently evaporated to 
make the rice dry enough; have a dish 
heated by the fire, put in the rice, put on 
two or three ounces of butter, cover the 
dish, and serve it up immediately. If rice 
is boiled in a bag in water all the nutritous 
part of the rice is boiled out, and nothing 
but dry, tasteless grains remain.

RICE CROQUETTES. 

Boil the rice in the usual manner. When 
it is cold make it into cakes the size of a 
beaten biscuit, or rather more than half an 
inch thick. Have a thin batter of flour and 
milk or flour and egg; dip the cakes in it 
and put them in a frying-pan of the proper 

(68) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

heat with sufficient sweet lard; fry them 
to a crisp brown on one side, then turn and 
fry on the other. Rice may be mixed with 
the eggs well beaten and stirred up with 
the rice so as to make all a light yellow, 
and fried in cakes without any batter. 

999 

SALSIFY, FRIED AND STEWED. 

Scrape the salsify until all the peeling or 
outer covering is taken off, then boil it in 
water until it is soft. Take it out of the 
water, cut it up and wash it. If it is to 
be stewed, put it on in a skillet with a pint 
of milk to a quart of salsify, and let it stew 
about fifteen minutes; season with salt and 
black pepper, and after taking it off the fire 
put in a large slice of butter. If the salsify 
is to be fried, mash it after it is sufficiently 
boiled, season with salt and pepper, and 
make it into little cakes. Have a batter of 
flour, milk, and two eggs for a quart of 
salisfy; dip the cakes into it, and fry them. 
Salsify should be boiled immediately after

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

it is washed and scraped. It is put on to 
boil in boiling water.

TOMATOES, DRESSED. 

Peel the tomatoes and cut them in two 
or three pieces. The large cherry tomato 
is the best kind for every purpose. To one 
quart of peeled and cut tomatoes put a gill 
or, if you like them wet, a gill and a half 
of brown sugar, and two rolls crumbled to 
pieces and seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Let them stew for about an hour, and when, 
they are served up stir in a large spoonful 
of batter. If you like the tomatoes baked, 
put thin slices of buttered bread in a dish 
with layers of tomatoes, alternately, the same 
proportion of sugar that you put to stewed 
tomatoes, and bake them. To dress the 
raw tomatoes take two dozen perfectly ripe 
cherry tomatoes of even size, peel them, 
and cut them into thin slices. To this quan- 
tity put one and a half gills of brown sugar 
and the same quantity of good vinegar, and 

(70) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

season highly with salt and black pepper. 
Spread a layer of tomatoes, then put on 
some of the vinegar and sugar, salt and 
pepper, and continue in this manner until 
all are in the dish. Some add mustard and 
sweet oil to tomatoes dressed in this man- 
ner, which makes a good sauce. 



SALADS 



SALADS 

CHICKEN. 

Take the breast, short legs, side bones, 
and wings leaving out the pinions of 
three large chickens or pullets, or a good- 
sized turkey, after they have become cold; 
take off the skin and fat and cut up the 
meat into very small pieces. Cut up celery 
into pieces a quarter of an inch thick, tak- 
ing care not to bruise it; put about one 
quart of celery sliced to this quantity of 
chicken or turkey. Mix three heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of English mustard with a little 
water, and let it stand a while. Boil four 
eggs very hard, mash up the yolks and mix 
them with half a gill of good cider vinegar, 
a gill of sweet oil, the mustard, salt enough 
for the whole salad, the whites of the eggs 
cut up, and three pickled cucumbers cut 
into little pieces; mix this seasoning with 
the meat and then put in the celery. Should 
this not taste enough of the pickle, add a 

(75) - 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

little more vinegar or another cucumber. 
The salad should be made and put into a 
covered dish some hours before it is wanted. 

999 

COLD SLAW. *^ 

Cut up the cabbage, or rather shred it, in 
the usual manner ; take half a pint of cream 
and half a pint of red pepper vinegar; beat 
three eggs well and stir into the vinegar, 
also two heaping teaspoonfuls of English 
mustard, a sufficient seasoning of salt, a 
slice of fresh butter, and two gills of yellow 
sugar; put the whole on the fire and let 
it boil up until the cream thickens a little, 
it must not form curds and whey. Then 
take it off, and as soon as it becomes per- 
fectly cold pour it over the cabbage. Some 
celery cut up and put with the cabbage is 

a great improvement to the slaw.

HOT SLAW. 

To one quart of fine shredded cabbage 
put half a pint of boiling water and two 

(76) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

teaspoonfuls of flour; boil it for fifteen min- 
utes, then stir in a slice of butter and pepper 
and vinegar or vinegar and mustard ; season 
with salt. To this same quantity of cab- 
bage shredded fine and boiled an hour and a 
half put half a pint or more of cream, some 
butter, salt, and pepper, and stew ten minutes.

VEAL SALAD. 

Take cold baked or roasted veal, cut it 
into very small pieces, take three hard- 
boiled eggs, cut up the whites and mash 
the yolks into a pulp, and mix them with 
half a gill of sweet oil, a gill of vinegar, 
and a large cucumber cut into bits, season 
the veal with salt and black pepper to the 
taste; mix two heaping teaspoonfuls of 
English mustard and sugar in the usual 
manner, add it to the eggs, then mix the 
whole with as much of the veal as it will 
season well. It is best to make this salad 
an hour or two before it is wanted and let 
it stand in a covered dish.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS 



PICKLES AND CATSUPS 

APPLE, GERMAN. 

Take good ripe crab apples, peel and 
weigh them; to eight pounds of apples put 
four pounds of brown sugar, one ounce of 
pounded allspice, three-quarters of an ounce 
of pounded cloves and the same of cinna- 
mon (also some mace if you like it), and 
just enough good cider vinegar to cover the 
apples. You may scald the vinegar and 
sugar and pour it hot on the fruit and 
spices, letting them stand twenty-four hours, 
and then boiling them until they are done; 
or you may put the sugar, vinegar, and fruit 
on at once and cook them slowly until the 
apples are soft enough. They must not 
stay long enough to commence falling to 
pieces. Put the spices in about five or six 
minutes before the apples are done. By 
" vinegar enough to cover the apples ' is 
meant vinegar with the sugar and juice 

(81) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

from the apples; there should not be more 
than two quarts of vinegar to eight pounds 

of apples. 

999 



TOMATO CATSUP. 

Take any quantity of ripe tomatoes you 
choose, stew them for three-quarters of an 
hour, then pass them through a sieve or 
colander. To four quarts of tomatoes put 
one quart of vinegar, one pint of silver 
onions chopped fine, four ounces of scraped 
horseradish, one and a half ounces of ginger 
pounded, the same of pounded black pepper, 
one ounce of allspice, half a pound of brown 
sugar; season with salt to taste. After it 
becomes cold, bottle it, and seal the bottles. 
The sealing-wax is made of melted rosin 
and pounded brick dust. Keep the bottles 

in a dry cellar.

CATSUP, WALNUT. 

Use the vinegar in which the walnuts have 
been kept (say one gallon of vinegar). Take 

(82) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

four dozen walnuts and beat them in a 
wooden mortar, then put them in the vine- 
gar and strain the whole through a coarse 
cloth; should the liquor taste too strong 
add a little more vinegar. Put to a gallon 
of the vinegar two tablespoonfuls of ginger, 
the same of black pepper (beaten fine), two 
of allspice (well beaten), a gill of black 
mustard seed (beaten fine), four ounces of 
garlic, half a pound brown sugar, and four 
ounces of rasped horseradish. Mix these 
ingredients well, bottle them, and seal the 
bottles. If the weather is warm, set the 
bottles in the sun for a week or ten days, 
then put them in a dry cellar. Putting the 
bottles in the sun I think may be an advan- 
tage to the catsup; I have never tried it. 



CHERRIES, PICKLED. 

Take perfectly ripe Morilla or cluster 
cherries and cut off half the stems. Take 
a gallon of good cider vinegar and add a 
tablespoonful of mace, one of cloves, and 

(83) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

one of allspice ; pound these spices and mix 
them with the vinegar; also put in a pound 
of brown sugar (if you like it not too acid) ; 
scald the vinegar and pour over the cher- 
ries, and when cold cover the jar close. 
After letting stand for three or four days 
pour off the vinegar and scald it and pour 
it back on the cherries; when they are en- 
tirely cold cover the jar again closely. They 
will be fit for use in a fortnight. I think 
the second scalding unnecessary. 



CHERRIES, GERMAN. 

Take eight pounds of cherries; add to 
them three-quarters of an ounce of cinna- 
mon, the same of cloves, and one ounce of 
allspice (beaten fine) ; also six pounds of 
sugar and three-quarters of a quart of strong 
vinegar. Stone the cherries, put them on 
with the sugar in a brass skillet, and stew 
them about half an hour, then add the vine- 
gar and spices and let them stew for about 
five minutes longer. Pour into a jar, and 

(84) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

as soon as cold cover close. Should the 
cherries not taste sufficiently of vinegar add 
a half pint of vinegar. The cherries should 
be stoned before they are weighed. 



PICKLED CUCUMBERS AND MELONS. 
To one gallon of vinegar put one and a 
half pounds of sugar, three lemons sliced, 
one gill of white mustard seed, one ounce 
of ginger, half an ounce of cloves, the same 
of mace, and three-quarters of an ounce of 
allspice. Beat these spices to a coarse pow- 
der, and add two ounces of celery seed 
bruised, two ounces of horseradish scraped 
fine, two ounces and a half of garlic. Mix 
these ingredients in July; put them in a 
jar and cover very close; set them in the 
hot sun every day for a month. Wash your 
cucumbers in cold water, put them in strong 
salt water for two or three weeks, then 
wash them again, green them in the usual 
manner (the greening of pickles and gher- 
kins should always be done in a brass or 

(85) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

porcelain-lined vessel), throw them in cold 
water for a few hours, then put them in 
vinegar for a fortnight. After that put them 
in a jar and pour over them the seasoned 
vinegar. They are ready for use in about 
two months. Soak the cucumbers in cold 
water for four or five hours before green- 
ing them. 



ANOTHER WAY OF PICKLING 
CUCUMBERS AND GHERKINS. 

Wash the cucumbers and put them in 
strong salt water for two or three weeks, 
then proceed with them as directed above 
for pickling cucumbers. To two gallons of 
vinegar put a pound and a half of brown 
sugar, two ounces of allspice, the same of 
black pepper, four ounces of ginger, two 
of white mustard seed (all pounded), four 
ounces of scraped horseradish, four pods of 
red pepper, and six silver onions. When 
the spices and vinegar are mixed, put them 
in a jar and set the jar in the hot sun every 

'(86) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

day for a fortnight. Then put the cucum- 
bers in jars, as many in each jar as the 
vinegar will cover, and pour the vinegar 
over them. They will be ready for use in 
about two months. 



DAMSONS, GERMAN. 

Take seven pounds of damsons, wipe 
them dry; take half an ounce of cinnamon, 
the same of cloves, and one ounce of all- 
spice; beat them very fine, add them to 
the damsons; take three pounds of sugar 
and one quart of strong vinegar, put it on 
the fire in a brass skillet, let it commence 
boiling, and immediately pour it on the fruit 
and spices. Cover the jar close and let 
stand twenty-four hours, then put the v/hole 
on the fire and let it boil seven or eight 
minutes, when it is done. The fruit may 
be used in a few weeks. This pickle may 
also be made by first preserving the dam- 
sons and then adding the vinegar and spices.

GREEN MANGOES. 

Wash the mangoes, put them in salt water 
strong enough to bear an egg, and let them 
remain for three or four weeks; then green 
them with alum and grape leaves; throw 
them into a tub of cold water, and as soon 
as they are cold take out the insides and 
put them in vinegar for a fortnight. The 
vinegar need not be strong. Soak the man- 
goes in cold water five or six hours before 
greening them. For thirty mangoes of the 
usual size, take one pound of white mustard 
seed, the same quantity of black mustard 
seed, one ounce of mace, two ounces of 
celery seed, and a quarter of a pound of 
horseradish scraped fine. After these in- 
gredients have been half pounded and mixed 
with three gills of good sweet oil stuff the 
mangoes. Tie them with a yarn string and 
lay them in jars. Put to this number of 
mangoes a dozen large silver onions peeled. 
Put to the vinegar for this number of 
mangoes (say this amount of seasoning for 
two gallons of vinegar instead of thirty

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

mangoes) three pounds of sugar, four ounces 
of horseradish scraped fine, two ounces of 
long pepper (soaked in warm water and 
sliced), two ounces of allspice half pounded, 
and four ounces of celery seed. Stir these 
well together, cover the jars close, and set 
in the hot sun every day for three or four 
weeks, according to how hot the sun is. 
Cover the jars with bladders and keep 
them close. This pickle is not ready for 
use in less than a year. It should be looked 
at every month or two and more vinegar 
added if necessary. The mangoes should 
be well covered by the vinegar. This pickle 
and all others should be made of good cider 
vinegar.

GREEN PEPPER. 

Take the sweet pepper as soon as it is 
fully grown and put in strong brine for a 
fortnight; then slit each pepper on one side 
and take out the seeds and put them in 
vinegar and water or weak vinegar for 

(89) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

another fortnight. Then stuff them with 
black and white mustard seed (bruised until 
the skin is broken), coriander seed bruised, 
celery seed (beaten fine), and sliced celery 
and sliced cucumbers prepared for pickling. 
Tie them with soft yarn string, put them in 
a jar and pour on vinegar. 



GREEN TOMATO. 

Take one peck of green tomatoes, cut them 
in slices, and put them in a jar in layers; 
sprinkle each layer with salt. Also put with 
them twelve large silver onions sliced trans- 
versely. Let them stand twenty-four hours, 
then take them out and let them drain. 
After they have drained add one ounce cori- 
ander seed, three parts red pepper cut into 
small pieces, three lemons sliced, two ounces 
English mustard, five pounds brown sugar, 
four ounces white mustard seed bruised, one 
ounce ginger, one ounce cloves, one ounce 
allspice, one ounce black pepper, and one 
ounce celery seed, all beaten fine. Put the

tomatoes and seasoning in layers alternately 
in the skillet; cover with strong vinegar 
and simmer briskly until the tomatoes are 
clear. 



LEMON PICKLE. 

Grate off the yellow rinds of the lemons 
and cut them across each end; pack them 
in a small vessel of dry salt, covering them 
with it. Let them remain eight days; take 
them out and put them in dishes and set 
the dishes in a hot oven, turning them until 
dry and the salt candies on them. Then 
put them in a pot, and put to twenty-five 
lemons one pound of white mustard seed, 
half pound of black pepper, the same of race 
ginger, a tablespoonful of mace, two of celery 
seed, a handful of horseradish, and a pound 
(or more) of brown sugar. Bruise the spices 
well, but do not pound them. Slice the 
ginger. Put the spices in with the lemons 
and pour on the vinegar enough to cover 
them. Cover the pot closely as soon as the 
contents is entirely cold.

MARTINIA. 

Take the young and tender martinias, 
wash them, and put them in strong salt 
water for ten days. Then take them out 
(they will probably have become very soft 
if not mashed up), wash them, and put in 
weak vinegar for five or six days. Then 
wash them carefully, and to one gallon of 
martinias put two quarts of strong cider 
vinegar, two ounces of scraped horseradish, 
one-half ounce of ginger, an ounce of all- 
spice, three-quarters of an ounce of black 
pepper, an ounce of black mustard seed (all 
beaten fine), two large silver onions chopped 
fine, two pounds of brown sugar, and a pod 
of pounded red pepper. Bottle this, cork 
and seal the bottles, and set them away in 

the cellar.

NASTURTIUM. 

Gather the berries when they are green 
and tender and put them in brine for 
twenty-four hours. Then take them out of 
the brine, put them in a jar, and cover them

with vinegar. To a gallon of nasturtiums 
put a gill of black pepper, broken, and a 
fourth of that quantity of bruised mace. 



OYSTERS, PICKLED. 

V/ash the oysters carefully in the liquor 
and strain the liquor through a cloth. Put 
the oysters in a brass skillet with all of the 
liquor. Put the skillet on the fire and let 
them simmer for about twenty-five minutes, 
then take out the oysters, lay each one sep- 
arately in a dish, pour oft 7 the liquor, and 
v/hen the oysters are cold, put them in a 
jar intermixed with bruised allspice, black 
pepper, and cloves. Make the liquor very 
salt ; add as much vinegar as there is liquor, 
and pour it on the oysters. The best way 
of putting up the oysters is to put in a 
layer of oysters, then the spice (do not put 
in so much spice that it will spoil the oys- 
ters), then pour on some of the liquor and 
vinegar, then a layer of oysters, and so on 
until the jar is filled. The oysters should 

(93) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

be cooked as much as when they are stewed 
for the table. Cover the jar closely. 



PEACHES, PICKLED. 

Gather the peaches when they are per- 
fectly ripe. The soft black Georgia peach 
or the white Heath peach make the best 
pickle. Wash them and put them in salt 
water for two days, then soak them in cold 
water for four or five hours. Wipe them 
carefully so as to get off as much of the 
fur as possible without bruising the peach. 
If the peaches are stoned, stuff them with 
mustard seed and a little pounded mace. 
Put one ounce of allspice, the same of cloves, 
the same of ginger, four ounces of black 
mustard seed (all well bruised), an ounce 
of horseradish scraped, and a pound of sugar 
to a peck of peaches.

PEACHES, GERMAN. 

Pare the peaches and weigh them. To 
eight pounds of peaches put one ounce of 

(94) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

allspice, three-quarters of an ounce of cin- 
namon, and the same of cloves, also one 
quart of strong vinegar and four pounds of 
sugar. Put the sugar on the peaches and 
let them stand three or four hours to ex- 
tract juice enough. Then put the peaches, 
with the juice and sugar, on the fire; stew 
them about twenty minutes, then put in the 
vinegar and pounded spices and let it boil 
five or six minutes. It is then done. Should 
there not be vinegar enough to cover the 
peaches, add as much as is necessary; they 
cannot be entirely covered as they will float 
somewhat on the vinegar. Keep the jar 
covered closely. One quart of vinegar is 
quite sufficient to cover the peaches; they 
float on top at first, but sink down under 
the vinegar in one or two days. 



PICKLED STURGEON. 

After the backbone has been taken out 
the sturgeon should be washed, changing 
the water several times, and then put in salt 

(95) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

water. After remaining twenty-four hours 
the salt water should be poured off and the 
sturgeon put in fresh salt water for twelve 
hours longer. The sturgeon should then be 
tied with a cord and boiled in weak salt 
v/ater until a straw can be run through it, 
taking care to skim off the oil during boil- 
ing. Strain the liquor in which the stur- 
geon has been boiled and boil it a short 
time, adding allspice, pepper, and ginger, 
which should be broken a little in a mortar. 
After it has boiled sufficiently add as much 
vinegar as is agreeable to the taste, and 
when the liquor is cold put in the sturgeon. 
Should there not be liquor enough to cover 
the sturgeon add as much vinegar as is 
necessary. The vessel in which the stur- 
geon is kept should be covered closely and 
kept in a cool place. 



TOMATOES, GERMAN. 

To eight pounds of quite ripe, peeled to- 
matoes add four pounds of brown sugar. 

(96) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

Put the tomatoes with all the juice and 
sugar into a glass- or porcelain-lined vessel 
and stew them until the syrup becomes of 
the consistency of a thick syrup. Add three- 
quarters of an ounce of allspice, half an 
ounce of cloves, quarter of an ounce of mace 
(all pounded). Let them stew for a few 
minutes, and then take off the tomatoes and 
add one quart of vinegar. Pour them into 
a jar and when they are cold cover closely. 
Three and one-half pounds of sugar may 
be used instead of four pounds. They will 
be fit for use in two or three weeks. 



WHITE WALNUT PICKLE. 

Put the walnuts in strong salt water for 
ten or twelve days, then scald in ashes and 
water, to take off the fur and gummy sub- 
stance that adheres to them. Wipe them 
with a soft cloth, being careful not to bruise 
them. Put them in cold vinegar until Au- 
tumn. Then change the vinegar, and add to 
the fresh vinegar the following ingredients: 

(97) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

to one hundred walnuts put half a pint of 
mustard seed, a large silver onion stuck full 
of cloves, half an ounce of allspice, the same 
of black pepper, and two ounces of scraped 
horseradish. Mix these with the vinegar 
(the onions should be put in the jar with 
the walnuts), and pour over the pickle. 
Cover the jar with a bladder. They will 
be ready for use in six months. Take care 
that the walnuts are perfectly tender, other- 
wise it is useless to pickle them. The vine- 
gar in which the walnuts are kept until 
Autumn may be used for making catsup. 
The spices should be pounded before they 
are put in the vinegar, and vinegar and spices 
set in the hot sun a few hours before putting 
in the walnuts. 



YELLOW MANGOES. 

Wash the mangoes well in cold water and 
put them in strong salt water; let them 
stay until they turn yellow. Then take out 
the insides, cover them with salt and water 

(98) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

(not much water), and put them in the sun 
to bleach. After they are bleached, put them 
in cold water to soak for three or four hours. 
Then put them in a dye of turmeric and 
vinegar for a fortnight or three weeks. Take 
a pound of peeled garlic, sprinkle it with 
salt, and put it in the sun for three or four 
days, then wash it and dry it in the sun. 
Put half of it in the vinegar, adding one 
ounce of turmeric (beaten fine and put in 
a thin cotton bag), four ounces of ginger 
pounded or broken, two ounces of allspice 
half pounded, two of long pepper (soaked 
in warm water and sliced), three pounds 
of sugar, and four ounces of horseradish 
scraped. This seasoning is for two gallons 
of good cider vinegar. Set the vinegar in 
the hot sun every day for a month. 

Cucumbers may be bleached or pickled by 
the same directions, but using half a pound 
of garlic for the same amount of seasoning. 
To stuff these mangoes, take one ounce of 
mace, two of turmeric, and two of celery 
seed well beaten, the remaining half pound

of garlic, horseradish scraped fine, and equal 
proportions of white and black mustard seed 
half pounded, mixed with three gills of sweet 
oil. Put the mangoes in jars, pour on the 
vinegar, spices, etc., to cover them, and cover 
closely with bladders and other covers if 
necessary. This pickle requires the same 
attention and is ready for use in the same 
time as the green mangoes. The mangoes 
should weigh from ten to twelve ounces.

BISCUIT, BEATER 

Take a quart of flour, two and a half 
ounces of lard, one and three-quarters gills 
of milk, and a teaspoonful of salt. Stir up 
the greater part of the flour with the lard, 
milk, and salt, then beat the biscuit with 
a heavy iron beater on a strong wooden 
mortar for twenty minutes, adding the re- 
mainder of the flour as you beat except a 
little for rolling out the biscuit. Then roll 
them well and divide the dough into four- 
teen biscuits. Stick them on top with a two- 
pronged fork. It takes half an hour for 
them to bake. They are much nicer made 
with cream instead of milk. Thin biscuits 
are made in exactly the same manner except 
they require less milk. Be very careful not 
to put in too much salt.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

BISCUIT, SODA. 

Soda biscuit are made with one drachm 
of bicarbonate of soda and two drachms of 
cream of tartar to one quart of flour, two 
or three ounces of lard, a little salt, and 
two gills and a half of milk. Dissolve the 
soda in the milk, stir the cream of tartar 
in the flour, and sift it with the flour. This 
bread should be made and baked as quickly 
as possible. The muffins and soda cakes 
have the same quantity of soda and cream 
of tartar mixed in the same manner. The 
muffins are made with two or three eggs, 
two ounces of lard, and three gills of milk, 
also a little salt to the quart. The cakes 
are made with three eggs, a pint of milk, 
and a little salt to the quart. They are 
baked on the griddle like any other bread. 
Soda dissolved in very sour buttermilk, or 
clabber, makes pretty good bread.

CAKES, BUCKWHEAT. 

To one quart of buckwheat put half a pint 
of meal, about half a gill of yeast, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, mixing up the whole with 
about a pint of warm water. Set it in a 
warm place to rise; when it has risen suf- 
ficiently bake it in large cakes on a griddle. 
Have a plate of fresh butter set by the fire 
to keep soft, and as you take the cakes off 
the griddle dip them in the butter. 



CAKES, VELVET. 

To one quart of flour put four eggs, four 
ounces of lard, half a gill of yeast, half a 
pint of water, and a teaspoonful of salt. 
Make this into a batter and set it in a warm 
place to rise; when it has risen sufficiently 
add nearly half a pint of water or milk, 
then stir it well. Have the griddle the 
proper heat, put a little lard upon it, and 
bake the batter in small cakes. They look 
fine baked in rings. If the yeast is at all 
bitter, half a gill to a quart of flour is too 

(105) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

much, as it may give the bread a bitter 
taste, a fourth of a gill will be sufficient. 
Add as much more water as you leave out 
yeast. 



CORNBREAD, RICE. 

Boil eight ounces of rice and let it get 
cold. Take six eggs, all the rice, a quart 
of meal, a little salt, one and a half pint of 
milk. Beat the eggs well. Rub a dish 
with lard, pour in the batter, and bake it. 
Cornbread requires less salt and takes a 
longer time to bake than any kind of bread 
made of flour. Do not put the rice in 
until all the other ingredients are stirred 
together.

CRACKERS. ^ 

Take one quart of flour, one egg, three 
ounces of butter, the same of lard, a little 
salt; make up the dough with sweet milk. 
Beat the dough well with an iron beater 
and roll it out in the thinnest cakes, stick

them with a fork, and bake crisp. Cream 
makes the crackers better than milk. 



LOAF BREAD CAKES. 

Cut off the outside crusts of a quart loaf, 
cut it into small pieces, and soak it in about 
one quart of milk for some hours. Mash 
the bread perfectly and add half a pint of 
flour, six eggs, and a little salt. The cakes 
may be made of bread a week or ten days 
old, or of very sour bread. If it is sour 
put a teaspoonful (a little rounding) of soda 
in some of the milk, dissolve it perfectly, 
and stir it in well. Bake these cakes on 
the griddle like any other batter bread. 
Very good waffles are made in this man- 
ner, adding a pint more milk for the waffles 
than for the cakes baked on the griddle.

MUFFINS, ENGLISH. 

To one quart of flour put two tablespoon-

two and a half gills of water, and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Beat the eggs well, add 
the yeast and some water, stir in the flour, 
and then add the remainder of the water 
and the salt. Work the batter well. Put 
it in a warm place to rise. When it has 
risen sufficiently stir it well and put it into 
muffin rings, which should have been rubbed 
well with lard, and bake. In measuring 
flour always see that it is well lightened, 
else you will get more than a quart in the 
quart measure.

MUFFINS, SODA. 

Soda biscuit are made with one drachm 
bicarbonate of soda and two drachms of 
cream of tartar to one quart of flour, two 
or three ounces of lard, a little salt, and two 
gills and a half of milk. Dissolve the soda 
in the milk, stir the cream of tartar in the 
flour, and sift it with the flour. This bread 
should be baked as soon after making as 
possible. The muffins and soda crackers 

' (108) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

have the same quantity of soda and cream 
of tartar mixed in the same manner. The 
muffins are made with two or three eggs, 
two ounces of lard, and three gills of milk, 
also a little salt, to the quart. The cakes 
are made with three eggs, a pint of milk, 
and a little salt to the quart. They are 
baked on the griddle like any other bread. 
Soda dissolved in very sour buttermilk 
makes good bread. 



ROLLS. 

Take one quart of flour, two tablespoon- 
fuls of yeast, two eggs, two ounces of lard, 
a gill of water, and a teaspoonful of salt. 
Knead the dough as for loaf bread and 
prepare it in the same manner for baking. 
Rolls are often made without eggs, in which 
case they require a gill and three-fourths 
of water and three ounces of lard. Put a 
dry potato well mashed in the yeast as you 
do for loaf bread.

RUSKS. 

Take one quart of flour, four ounces (or 
a small teacup) of loaf sugar, half a gill of 
potato yeast (or two tablespoonfuls of hop 
yeast), half a pint of water, and two or 
three ounces of sweet lard. Make this up 
as you do for loaf bread and set it to rise. 
After it has risen, divide it into pieces the 
size and shape of rolls; put them in an 
oven by the fire to rise. When they have 
risen sufficiently in the oven, take the yel- 
low of an egg, well beaten and mixed with 
a little water, and glaze the top of the rusks ; 
then bake them until they are done. Rusks 
sometimes have currants put in them, only 
a small quantity, however. 



SALLY LUNN. 

To one quart of flour put two tablespoon-

to rise; when it has risen sufficiently put 
it into a mould that has been rubbed with 
flour and set it in an oven by the fire to 
rise, which it should do in about three- 
quarters of a hour, and then bake it. 



WAFFLES, RICE. 

Boil half a pound of rice, when it is cold 
add to it four eggs, a pint of flour, and a 
little salt, mixing up the whole with as 
much sweet milk as will make it a soft 
batter. Put a small piece of lard in the 
waffle irons, have them the proper heat, and 
fill them with the batter; they must be 
turned once or twice in the baking. Beat 
the eggs well, then add the rice, then the 

flour and salt; stir in the milk last of all.

risen bake it. 



CHEESE CAKES. 

Take two quarts of sour milk, put it on

vinegar as will turn it to a thick curd. Take 
out the curds without any whey; beat them 
well, adding half a pound of butter. Then 
stir in six eggs well beaten and eight ounces 
of sugar, seasoning with mace or nutmeg. 
Pour this compound into little moulds of 
pastry, and bake it. Serve up cold. Eight 
eggs and six ounces of butter may be used 
instead of six eggs and eight ounces of 
butter. The salt should be washed out of 
the butter for cheese cakes.

CITRON CAKE. 

One pound of flour, one of sugar, one of 
eggs, and one of butter; prepare this ex- 
actly as you do for pound cake. Slice a 
pound of citron into small, thin slices, rub 
it in flour, and stir it in the cake. All cakes 
but fruit cake should be half cold before 
taking them out of the pan. 



COMPOSITION CAKE. 

One and three-quarters pounds of flour, a 
pound and a quarter of sugar, twelve ounces 
of butter, three gills of milk, six eggs, two 
pounds of seedless plums, half a gill of 
brandy, a gill of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, 
cloves, and allspice) pounded very fine, and 
a heaping teaspoonful of soda dissolved in 
some of the milk (which should be sour). 
Each plum should be cut in two or three 
pieces and the pieces rolled in flour before 
being put in the cake. Have the pans pre- 
pared, put in the cake, and bake. Beat the 
whites and yellows of the eggs separately, 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and bake the cake immediately after it is 
made. 



CREAM CAKE. 

To three pints of flour put two of loaf 
sugar and three-quarters of a pint of cream, 
two drachms of cream of tartar and one of 
soda, eight eggs, and a little mace or nut- 
meg. Beat the eggs well, yellows and 
whites together. Put in the eggs, then the 
flour. Dissolve the soda in the cream and 
stir it in the sugar, eggs, etc. Mix the 
cream of tartar with the flour before sift- 
ing it and stir it in the cake. Bake imme- 
diately in pans that have been rubbed with 
lard. 




FRUIT CAKE. 

One pound of flour, one of sugar, one of 
eggs, one of butter, two of seedless raisins, 
two of picked currants, four ounces of 
blanched almonds sliced fine, and four 
ounces of citron sliced fine. First prepare 
the sugar, eggs, flour, etc., exactly as you 

(115) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

do for pound cake. Cut the plums in two 
or three pieces, and roll them, the currants, 
and the citron in flour before putting in the 
cake. The best way of rolling them in the 
flour is to put them in a sifter with some 
flour and stir them about in it with the 
hand until all the flour falls through, ex- 
cept what adheres to the fruit. It takes 
more than double as long for this cake to 
bake than for pound cake. Have the pan 
well rubbed with lard. Let the cake be 
entirely cold before taking it out of the 
pan. 



GENERAL R. E. LEE CAKE. 

Take eighteen eggs, equal weight of all 
the eggs in sugar, and half the weight in 
flour. Make as you would sponge cake. 
Use the rinds and juice of two large oranges 
and two large lemons (or three medium- 
sized ones of each kind), half of these to 
go for an icing and the other half in the 
cake. Make the icing of the whites of six

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

eggs, two and a half pounds of pulverized 
sugar, and the fruit rinds and juice. The 
rinds and juice put in the icing must be

work it with the flour, until the mixture 
becomes what is called a cream, that is 
white and of the consistency of thick cream. 
Then work it into the cake and beat the 
cake for twenty minutes with a strong hand. 
Have a cake pan rubbed with a little lard, 
pour in the cake, and bake it with a slow

bake best in shallow pans or moulds of tin. 
There is no objection to the pans being large 
if they are shallow.

APPLE. ***. 

To one pint of stewed apples put twelve 
ounces of brown sugar, half a pound of fresh 
butter, and eight eggs. Pass the apples 
through a colander as soon as you take 
them off the fire, then immediately stir in 
the butter. Beat the eggs well, stirring the 
sugar, and then mix them with the apples 
and butter. Have a dish prepared with 
paste as for cocoanut pudding; pour in the 
pudding and bake it. Serve up cold. Wash 
the salt out of the butter for this pudding. 
The apples should be stewed dry. 



COCOANUT.

beat up in a mortar one cocoanut, after 
carefully scraping off the rind, and mix it 
with the above ingredients. Pour it into 
a dish with pastry around the edges and 
at the bottom, and bake until done. Serve 
up cold. The whites of eggs make an equally 
good pudding prepared with the same in- 
gredients as the yolks, but they are put to- 
gether in different proportions. The salt 
should be washed out of the butter for this 
pudding.

separately. When they are sufficiently 
beaten put them together and add three- 
quarters of a quart of flour and a quart of 
milk, with a little salt. Pour into a cloth 
properly prepared and boil it. A thinner 
and softer pudding may be made with one 
pint of flour, one quart of milk, and eight 
eggs. Serve up hot with wine or cream 
sauce. Boiled puddings or dumplings are 
put on to boil in boiling water.

soak it in a quart of milk, beat up ten eggs 
and add to the bread and milk a pound and 
a quarter of fine chopped mutton suet, half 
a pint of flour, a little salt, and three pounds 
of seedless raisins. The raisins should be cut 
in two and rolled in flour before they are 
put in the pudding. Dip a strong cotton 
or linen cloth in hot water, sprinkle it with 
flour, and then pour in the pudding, tying 
it securely, while not so as to press the 
pudding. Put it in a pot of boiling water 
and let it boil four hours. Serve up hot 
with wine or cream sauce. After putting 
the bread in the milk mash it well before 
adding the other ingredients.

LEMON. 

Take the yolks of one dozen eggs, the 
whites of six, stir in one-half pound of loaf 
sugar, half a pint of cream, half a pound 
of fresh butter, and the juice and grated 
rinds of three lemons. Beat the eggs well, 
strain them and the lemons through a sieve, 
and mix with the other ingredients. Put 
the pudding on the fire in the earthen dish 
in which it is made and stir it constantly 
until it begins to thicken. Then put in a 
dish prepared with paste and bake it. Serve 
up cold. Wash the salt out of the butter 
for this pudding. 



MERINGUE. 

Take the amount of two rolls, or say three 
slices of stale bread, pour over them one 
pint of milk, and let it soak a short time. 
Beat very light the yolks of four eggs and 
one teacup of brown sugar. Beat the mix- 
ture together and bake it in a dish as you 
would a custard. When cold spread over

the top a layer of stewed fruit or marma- 
lade of any kind. Whip up the whites of 
four eggs to a stiff froth with a teacup of 
white sugar; spread this over the layer of 
fruit, and set it in the oven for a few min- 
utes until it is a light brown color. You 
may flavor the pudding with vanilla or any 
spice. The flavoring is put in the whites 
of eggs and white sugar. 






MOLASSES. 

Prepare a quart loaf as for preserve pud- 
ding. Butter the bread, using half a pound 
of butter for that purpose. Take three pints 
of molasses and stir in three-quarters of a 
gill of pounded ginger. Lay the bread in 
the dish and pour on the molasses between 
each layer. Pour what is left over the 
whole pudding. It takes between two and 
three hours to bake, and it should be chopped 
with a knife occasionally. Serve up warm 
or cold.

POTATO. 

Boil some Irish potatoes until they are 
perfectly well done; peel and mash them 
to a pulp. To one pound of potatoes put 
eight ounces of butter, a pound of brown 
sugar, eight eggs, and season with mace or 
nutmeg. Stir the butter in the potatoes 
while they are hot; beat the eggs well and 
then add the sugar; mix the whole and 
bake in a deep dish with or without paste. 
Serve hot.

PRESERVE. 

Cut off the outside crust of a quart loaf, 
cut it into slices half an inch thick, make 
a batter of six eggs and a pint of milk, soak 
the bread in it so as to soak up all the 
batter, lay in the dish layers of bread and 
preserves (cherries are the best) alternately 
with some slices of good butter, four ounces 
in all. Bake until the bread is a light brown 
on top. Serve up warm with cream sauce. 
Bake in a deep dish.

RICE. 

Boil four ounces of rice; as soon as it is 
cool stir in four ounces of butter and a full 
half pint of cream, eight ounces of loaf 
sugar, and six eggs, well beaten; season 
with cinnamon and nutmeg. Pour the bat- 
ter in a dish, prepare with paste, and boil

RICE CUSTARD. 

To one quart of new milk put six eggs. 
Beat the eggs well, strain them, and pour 
the boiling milk on them, stirring them as 
you pour the milk on. Boil four ounces 
of rice until well done and with rather less 
water than it is boiled with as a vegetable; 
add it to the custard, and put the whole on 
the fire and boil it not longer than a min- 
ute, stirring well all the time. Sweeten 
with loaf sugar and season with nutmeg 
or vanilla.

JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

SAGO. 

Take two ounces and a half of pearl sago, 
washed clean. Take one quart of new milk, 
let it commence boiling, then stir in the 
sago. Let it boil four or five minutes, stir- 
ring constantly. Then take it off, and 
sweeten with loaf sugar. When cool stir 
in half a pint of rice, cream, and season 
with vanilla.

SUET. 

Cut the brown crust off a quart loaf, soak 
it in a quart of milk, then add half a pint 
of flour, eight or ten eggs, a little salt, and 
a pound and a quarter of minced beef or 
mutton suet. Prepare and boil in the same 
manner as plum pudding. Serve up hot 
with wine or cream sauce. 



SWEETMEAT. 

To one pint of syrup of green sweetmeats 
put four ounces of butter and six eggs ; beat 
up the eggs well; wash the salt out of the 

(135) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

butter; stir the eggs, butter, and syrup to- 
gether; put the pudding on the fire and 
let it remain five or six minutes, stirring it 
all the time. Season with ginger beaten to 
a fine powder. Cut up four of the green 
sweetmeats in thin slices, lay them in a dish 
prepared with paste, pour on the pudding, 
and bake. It may be served up warm or 
cold according to the taste. Bake in a shal- 
low dish. 

&$& 
TAPIOCA. 

Take a thin lemon peel, a little loaf sugar 
and cinnamon, and a quart of new milk; 
put all in the stewpan on the fire; as soon 
as it commences boiling put in three or four 
ounces of clean picked tapioca; let it sim- 
mer gently until the tapioca is soft, then 
take out the lemon peel and cinnamon. Add 
the whites of two and the yolks of six eggs, 
beaten well, and sweeten to taste. Put the 
whole into a well-buttered pudding mould, 
cover with a piece of buttered paper, and 
steam in a stew pan for one hour with as 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

little water as possible. Take it out of the 
stewpan and let it stand for a few minutes 
before turning it out. This pudding may 
be baked like rice pudding. It may be made 
richer by adding a large slice of butter when 
the eggs are put in, or by using cream in- 
stead of milk. Serve up cold. 



TRANSPARENT. 

Take eight eggs, half a pound of butter, 
half a pound of loaf sugar, season with 
nutmeg, ginger, or any seasoning you like. 
Beat the eggs well, add the butter and 
sugar, put it on the fire and stir until it 
begins to thicken, then pour it into a dish 
prepared with paste, and bake it. Serve 
up warm. Wash the salt out of the butter 
for this pudding. 




VIRGINIA PLUM. 

Take one pound of flour, one pound of 
loaf sugar, three-quarters of a pound of 

(137) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

butter, and twelve eggs. Beat the yolks 
and whites separately until they are both 
very light, stir the sugar in the yolks, then 
add the whites. Cream the butter and flour 
together and then beat in the sugar and 
eggs. Take two pounds of stoned plums, 
cut them in two, roll them in flour, and put 
them in the pudding; also put in a little 
mace. Boil for four hours and serve the 
pudding hot with rice sauce.

ICING. 

The whites of fourteen eggs, three pounds 
of sugar, and three gills of water. Boil the 
sugar and water until the syrup will rope, 
then pour it into a dish and beat it to blood 
heat. Have the whites beaten to a light 
froth ; season with extract of lemon. When 
a cake is to be iced it should be glazed over 
with the white of an egg while it is warm 
the glazing can be put on with a stiff 
feather. The sugar must be pounded and 
sifted through a fine sieve for icing and 
must be white loaf sugar. Another way 
of making icing is to beat the whites of 
four eggs to a froth and then beat in a 
pound of sugar; season with lemon. The 
thickness of the icing depends upon the 
number of coats put on the cakes.

CREAMED. 

Stir together one pound of pulverized 
sugar and eight ounces of butter until they 
become a sort of cream ; then stir in a gill of 
good Madeira wine, and grate in sufficient 
nutmeg. This sauce is improved by adding 
two tablespoonfuls of rich cream before 
putting in the wine.

WINE. 

Take one pound and a half of loaf sugar, 
a gill of very thin paste, six ounces of but- 
ter, and two gills of good Madeira wine; 
have the paste very hot, so as to make the 
batter. After stirring it in beat in the sugar, 
grate in half a nutmeg; last of all pour in 
the wine just as you are ready to serve the 
sauce. It should be kept by the fire always 
until wanted. 



PRESERVES

BLACKBERRY. 

To one quart of blackberries put three- 
quarters of a pound of brown sugar; put 
the sugar and fruit on the fire together and 
stew them until they are quite done, stir- 
ring them all the time. Put them into a 
jar, and when they are entirely cold cover 
closely. 



CHERRY. 

Draw the stones out of the cherries by 
the stems, weigh the fruit, and to one pound 
of cherries put a pound or a pound and a 
quarter of pounded loaf sugar. Put the 
sugar over the cherries an hour or two be- 
fore preserving them; stew them until they 
are done, then put them into jars (small 
jars are the best). When they are entirely 
cold paste on a paper cover and leave them 
for two or three weeks.

CHERRY PEPPER. 

Gather the peppers when they are young 
and tender, put them in brine for three 
weeks, changing the brine every two days. 
Then cut a slit into the side of them and 
take out the seeds. Afterward put them in 
cold water for a week, changing the water 
every day. Green the peppers with alum 
and grape leaves in a brass skillet; then 
throw them into cold water for twenty-four 
hours, changing the water once. Weigh the 
peppers, and into every pound of peppers 
put two pounds of loaf sugar and a quart 
of water. After making the syrup, boil the 
peppers in it for fifteen minutes, then put 
them in a jar and pour the syrup on them. 
Every other day pour off the syrup, boil 
it, and pour it back on the peppers; con- 
tinue until the syrup is thick enough. Sea- 
son with extract of lemon or mace. The 
peppers may require rather more than fif- 
teen minutes for boiling in water and in the 
syrup.

CRAB APPLE. 

Pare the crab apples and weigh them. To 
a pound of fruit put a pound of sugar and 
a quart of water. Put the parings with a 
few crab apples, cut into quarters, and the 
water into a skillet; boil for half an hour. 
Strain the juice through a coarse cloth, put 
in the sugar, and make the syrup; then put 
in the fruit and boil it until perfectly done 
(it will turn a pretty red). Take it out and 
let the syrup remain until it becomes a thin 
jelly. When both syrup and fruit are en- 
tirely cold put them into jars and cover 
closely. This fruit should be preserved early 
in October, when firm or hard. Always 
gather it from the trees and select those 
apples that are of middle size. The apples 
should be laid in a dish to get cold and the 
syrup put into a bowl until it is cold. 



DAMSON. 

Pick the stems off the damsons and 
weigh them. To one pound of fruit put 

(147) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

three-quarters of a pound of brown sugar. 
Stew them until they are done, stirring 
them all the time and taking out the 
stones; put them into a jar and cover 
closely. Put the damsons to stew without 
the sugar; after the skins have burst and 
the juices run out add the sugar. 

999 

FIG. 

Gather the figs before they are perfectly 
ripe, with a short stem, slit them on one 
side, and soak in lime water three or four 
hours, then soak in water until they lose 
the taste of lime. Make a syrup of loaf 
sugar, one pound of sugar, and one pint 
of water to one pound of fruit. After the 
syrup has boiled a short time drop in the 
figs and boil until done. 



GREEN SWEETMEAT. 

Peel the melons and lay them in salt water 
for four or five days, changing the water 
every other day. Green them with alum 

(148) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and grape leaves; then throw them in cold 
water for twenty-four hours, changing the 
water once. Boil them in water until you 
can stick a straw through them easily; then 
throw them into a tub of ice water, chang- 
ing the water to take out the alum. Weigh 
the melons, and to each pound put two 
pounds of loaf sugar and one quart of water ; 
make your syrup, and season with ginger, 
extract of lemon, or mace. If you season 
with extract of lemon (then soak them in 
cold water twenty-four hours) or mace, do 
not put it in until you have boiled the syrup 
for the last time, then put it in just before 
pouring on the sweetmeats. If you season 
with ginger beat some white ginger fine, 
tie it in a little piece of muslin, and let it 
boil in the syrup the last time it is boiled, 
until there is a strong taste of ginger. Boil 
the melons in the syrup about half an hour, 
then put them in jars and cover close to 
keep in the steam. Every other day pour 
off the syrup, boil it, and pour it back on 
the melons. Repeat this process until it 

(149) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

is thick enough. The last time the syrup 
is boiled let it get cold before the jars are 
covered. If you preserve the glass melons 
be sure they are not too tender. Take out 
the seeds after they have been greened and 
are cold.

LEATHER APPLE, 

PEACH, AND PEAR. 

Peel the fruit and stew it with a sufficient 
quantity of water until it is perfectly done, 
then pass it through a colander so as to 
avoid having hard bits in the fruit. Sea- 
son the apples with ginger; the pears and 
peaches are best without seasoning. Sweeten 
to taste with brown sugar. Rub butter 
(without any salt on it) on the bottom of 
long dishes and spread the fruit on them 
in layers about a third of an inch thick, 
and set them in the sun to dry. After the 
fruit has dried on the upper side turn it 
over carefully, and when it has dried suf- 
ficiently on that side turn it over again, and 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

keep turning it until it is perfectly dry. 
Always take it in at night. When it is 
quite dry put it away in jars with a little 
powdered loaf sugar put between the pieces 
of leather. 



MARMALADE PEACH, 

PEAR, AND QUINCE. 

To one pound of pears put three-quarters 
of a pound of brown sugar and a gill of 
water; quinces take about half a pint, and 
peaches half a gill. Put the fruit and water 
in a brass vessel and let it stew about an 
hour, or until it has become a jam. Do not 
put the sugar in until the fruit has been 
stewed soft; stir the fruit constantly after 
you put in the sugar. When the marma- 
lade is done put it into jars, and when it 
is perfectly cold cover the jars closely.

ORANGE. 

Select good oranges as fresh as possible; 
lay them in cold water for twenty-four hours, 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

changing the water once. Then put them 
in cold water and boil them until a straw 
can be darted through them. Throw away 
the water in which the oranges are boiled, 
as it has a bitter taste. Make a syrup of 
two pounds of loaf sugar and a pint of 
water to a pound of oranges; perforate the 
oranges all over with a sharp two-pronged 
fork or knitting-needle, and boil them in 
syrup. After the oranges are done take 
them out, and let the syrup boil until it is 
thick enough; then pour it hot over the 
oranges. The second day examine the 
oranges, and if the syrup is not thick 
enough boil it over and pour it hot on them. 
It must cover the oranges. Weigh the 
oranges before putting them in the water. 

999 

ORANGE PEEL. 

Take off the peelings carefully ; take only 
those peelings that are thick and have no 
imperfections on them; weigh them, then 
lay in cold water for two days, changing 

(/52) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

the water night and morning. Boil them 
in water until you can run a straw through 
them, then take them out and lay them 
separately in a dish. Do not use the water 
in which the peelings were boiled for mak- 
ing the syrup. Make a syrup with two 
pounds of loaf sugar to a quart of water 
(for a pound of peelings). Boil the peel- 
ings in it until done, then put them in jars, 
and when the syrup is done pour it over 
the peelings. To candy the peelings boil 
the syrup longer. 

999 

PEACH. 

Pare the peaches carefully and take out 
the stones of about half the quantity you 
wish to preserve. To one pound of fruit 
put one pound of loaf sugar and half a pint 
of water. Put the sugar and water on the 
fire, let it boil for twenty minutes, then put 
in the peaches and boil them for a time, or 
until they are nearly transparent. After 
they are done lay them in a dish, each peach 

(153) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

separate from the others. Boil the syrup 
until it becomes ropy, put it in a bowl, to 
get entirely cold; when both syrup and 
peaches are entirely cold put them in jars 
and cover closely. It is an improvement 
to the peaches to put a few peeled kernels 
into the syrup. In making preserves the 
heat should be uniform and not too great. 
If the fruit boils too fast it will not be so 
perfect. 

999 

PEAR. 

Pare the pears, leaving the stems on, and 
weigh them. To one pound of fruit put a 
pound of loaf sugar (if fruit is sweet) or 
a pound and a quarter (if fruit is sour), and 
one pint of water. Boil the sugar and water 
about fifteen minutes, then put in the pears, 
and boil until a straw can be run through 
them. Take them out, lay them in a dish, 
boil the syrup until it becomes a thin jelly, 
then pour into a bowl. When the fruit and 
syrup become entirely cold put them into 
jars and cover closely. The pears should 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

be red and nearly transparent before they 
are taken out of the syrup. 

999 

QUINCE. 

Pare the quinces and take out the cores, 
after cutting them into quarters. Put the 
cores and peelings in a brass skillet, with 
rather more than a quart of water for every 
pound of cores and peelings. Boil for about 
half an hour, then strain through a coarse 
cloth, set the juice back on the fire and put 
in the quinces, boiling them until half done ; 
then take them out and put in the sugar, 
a pound for every pound of fruit (loaf sugar 
is used always for fruits preserved whole). 
Boil the syrup about two or three minutes, 
then put back the quinces and let them re- 
main until they have become a pretty red 
color and look transparent. Then take them 
out and let the syrup continue to boil until 
it becomes a thin jelly. When both fruit 
and syrup, or jelly, are entirely cold put 
them into jars and cover them closely. The 

(155) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 



slices of quinces should be laid separately 
in a dish to cool and the syrup poured into 
a bowl to cool. 

999 
RASPBERRY. 

To one quart of raspberries put three- 
quarters of a pound of brown sugar; set 
the sugar and fruit on the fire together and 
stew until the fruit is done. Stew it so as 
not to let the fruit burn, but take care not 
to overheat it. Put it into jars and when 
it is quite cold cover closely. 

999 

STRAWBERRY. 

To one pound of strawberries put one 
pound and four ounces of loaf sugar, laying 
the sugar on the fruit about three hours 
before you are ready to preserve it. Then 
set it on the fire and let it stew about 
twenty minutes, stirring it carefully so as 
to prevent burning, but at the same time 
do not break the fruit. Put it into half- 
pint tumblers, and when cold paste covers 

(156) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

of white paper on them and sun them for 
about a fortnight. Strawberry marmalade, 
or jam, is made with three-quarters of a 
pound of brown sugar to a pound of fruit 
and stewed until it becomes a thick jam, 
being stirred all the time. Put it into jars 
and when cold cover closely. It is better 
to let the marmalade get cold before put- 
ting it in jars, some think.

JELLY 



JELLY 

APPLE. 

Take eight pounds of crab apples, or any 
winter apple that has a pleasant flavor, wash 
them and cut them into quarters. Add to 
this quantity four quarts of water and stew 
them until they are entirely done. Then 
strain the juice through a coarse cloth. This 
quantity of fruit will make four pints of 
juice. To each pint put a pound of loaf 
sugar, then boil until the whole becomes 
a thick jelly. When cold put it into jars 
and cover closely. The pulp of the apple 
or of quinces and pears made into jelly may 
be passed through a sieve and, with the 
addition of sugar, makes a jam. 

999 

CRANBERRY. 

To one pound of cranberries put one and 
a quarter pounds of loaf sugar and a gill 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

and a half of water. Stew for about half 
an hour; when cold they are ready for use. 
They will keep tv/o or three weeks. To 
make cranberry jelly, put two or three gills 
of water to a pound of the fruit; stew it 
to a perfect pulp, strain the juice through 
a piece of muslin, and put a pound of loaf 
sugar to every pint of juice. Boil it until 
it becomes a jelly, then pour it into moulds. 



CURRANT. 

Press the currants and strain the juice 
through a cloth; to one pint of juice put 
one pound of loaf sugar. Let the sugar and 
juice boil for twelve minutes, then put it 
into half-pint tumblers, and when the jelly 
is cold paste on covers of white paper. Sun 
the jelly for about a fortnight.

FOX GRAPE. 

Gather the grapes when they are green and 
tender, take as many as you wish, pick off 
the stems, and stew them in a brass skillet 
with sufficient water until they are entirely 
done. It takes just four pounds of the 
fruit and one pint of water to make three 
pints of juice. Strain the stewed grapes 
through a coarse cloth, and to one pint of 
juice put a pound of loaf sugar; let it boil 
until it becomes a thick jelly. Pour it into 
moulds, and when it is cold cover the moulds 
with paper. The best way to strain the 
juice is to first pass it through a colander, 
and then strain through a muslin cloth. 
Put a small piece of alum with the grapes 
to green the jelly. 



GOOSEBERRY JELLY. 

To every pound of gooseberries put two 
gills of water. Set them on the fire and 



( 163 ) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

stew them to a pulp, adding a piece of alum 
the size of a plum. Strain the juice through 
a muslin cloth, but do not press the fruit 
too much or the jelly will not be so clear. 
To every pint of juice put a pound of loaf 
sugar. Boil it until it becomes a jelly ; then 
pour in the moulds. Cover the moulds. 



QUINCE AND PEAR. 

These jellies are made exactly in the same 
manner as the apple jelly, except that the 
quinces require rather more water for the 
same quantity of fruit. They may be 
moulded in blanc mange moulds. Cover the 
moulds, and when you wish to take them 
out, dip the moulds in hot water or hold 
them over the fire.

ICE CREAM AND ICES 



ICE CREAM AND ICES 

BURNT SUGAR. 

To one quart of new milk put eight eggs 
(leaving out the whites if you prefer), beat- 
ing the eggs well. Stir in a tablespoonful of 
flour, strain the eggs through a sieve, and 
add them to the milk. Take ten ounces of 
light brown sugar, put it into a skillet, and 
stir it until it boils up. Add the eggs and 
milk and boil two or three minutes. Sea- 
son with cinnamon, pounded, put in a muslin 
bag and boiled in the custard. As soon as 
the custard is cold freeze it. 



CARAMEL. 

To one quart of fresh cream put ten 
ounces of light brown sugar and a table- 
spoonful of flour. Put the sugar into a 
brass skillet and let it boil up, stirring it 
constantly. Mix the flour with a little of 

(/67) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

cream and then add the remainder of cream, 
stirring it well so as to distribute the flour 
equally without any lumps throughout the 
cream. As soon as the sugar boils up pour 
on the cream and let it stay until the sugar 
mixes entirely with it, which is done by a 
constant stirring. Season with powdered 
cinnamon, and as soon as it is entirely cold 
freeze it. Brown sugar (it should be of 
the nicest) is much better than loaf sugar 
for caramel, as the loaf sugar has a bitter 
taste when burned. 



COCOANUT CREAM. 

To two quarts of cream put two cocoa- 
nuts (grated or beaten fine in a mortar), 
and a pound and four ounces of sugar. Beat 
the cream and cocoanut well together. The 
cream may be whipped before the cocoanut 
is put in. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

LEMON CREAM. 

To one quart of pure cream put one quart 
of buttermilk, one pound of loaf sugar, the 
juice of two lemons, of medium size, with 
the oil from the rind of three or four of 
them. This cream may be made with the oil 
of lemon, but it is not so good as when 
made with the fresh lemon. Put the cream 
in the freezer on the ice before putting in 
the lemon. To obtain the oil from the rind, 
rub the sugar on the rind. 

999 

ORANGE ICE. 

To two quarts of pure juice put one pound 
and six ounces of loaf sugar. To make 
orange ice cream, to two quarts of pure 
cream put twelve ounces of sugar and sea- 
son it to the taste with extract of orange. 
The proper proportions for freezing is one 
pound of fine salt to two pounds of pounded 
ice. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

PEACH. 

To two quarts of good cream put one 
pound and a half of loaf sugar and one 
quart of peaches (the soft peach) mashed 
to a pulp. The peaches must be perfectly 
ripe; take out the stringy substance that 
is next to the stone and mash them to a 
soft pulp. They are much nicer when 
passed through a colander if you have one 
of silver; a tin one will give them a taste. 
The ice cream is very good with only one 
quart of pure cream and one quart of milk.

SHERBET. 

To one pint of water put one pound of 
loaf sugar, the juice of six lemons, and the 
whites of one dozen eggs beaten to a froth. 
Mix the sugar with the lemon juice and 
water as soon as the eggs are beaten, and 
stir them in and freeze immediately. The 
lemons must be large and well flavored.

STRAWBERRY. 

To two quarts of pure, rich, sweet cream, 
put seven-eighths of a quart of pure straw- 
berry juice, and one quart of pounded loaf 
sugar; the cream should be at the freezing 
point when the juice is put in. Mix the 
sugar and cream well together; pour in the 
flavoring ; set the freezer in the ice and salt 
and, when it is cold, stir in the juice. This 
cream and all the other creams, except peach 
and cocoanut, should be whipped with a 
whip just before freezing, unless a patent 
freezer is used they always have dashers 
in them. Very good strawberry cream can 
be made by putting three-quarters of a quart 
of rnashed strawberries to one quart of 
cream and one quart of milk. 

The ice for freezing should be broken into 
small pieces and mixed with about half its 
weight of salt. Cover the vessel which con- 
tains the freezer with a woolen cloth unless 
it has a wooden cover. Shake the freezer 
constantly, unless you have a freezer with 
a dasher inside, in which case you turn that 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

constantly until the cream is frozen too hard 
to move it easily. Always freeze in a pantry 
or a cool room in the basement. One quart 
of sugar weighs one pound and four ounces. 



SYLLABUB. 

To one pint of rich cream add half a pint 
of Madeira wine ; sweeten to your taste with 
loaf sugar. Whip with a whip and churn 
in a cool room; or put the cream on the ice 
if the weather is warm. If you want the 
syllabub dry put it in a sieve to drip as fast 
as you whip it up. 



VANILLA. 

To two quarts of pure cream put twelve 
ounces of loaf sugar. The seasoning of 
vanilla depends upon the strength of the 
extract; generally it takes two teaspoon- 
fuls of the extract to flavor one quart of 
cream. If a good bean is cut up and macer- 
ated in six tablespoonfuls of brandy it takes 

(172) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

about four tablespoonfuls to flavor two 
quarts of cream.

WINE. 

To two quarts of pure, rich cream put one 
pint of good Madeira wine and one pound 
six ounces of pounded loaf sugar; have the 
cream in the freezer and on the ice before 
you put in the wine. Whip it to a froth 
with a whip, and churn. 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS 



MISCELLANEOUS DESSERTS 

APPLE SNOW. 

To about a quart of well-stewed green 
apples put the whites of two eggs beaten 
to a froth; sweeten the apples, and then 
beat them and the eggs together so as to 
mix them thoroughly. They are very good 
to eat with milk. By adding a little rich 
cream and freezing them you have a very 
good ice. Season the apple with nutmeg, 
the extract of leaves, or fresh lemon. 



BLANC MANGE. 

To three pints of milk add six eggs (save 
out the whites of three eggs for use later), 
one-half cup of white sugar, and a box of 
Cox's gelatin. Heat the milk until it comes 
to a boil, beat the eggs as light as possible ; 
beat in the sugar. Pour on the boiling milk 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 



and immediately stir in the gelatin ; then add 
the whites of three eggs, after they are 
beaten. 



CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Wash one box of Cox's gelatin in cold 
water, dissolve it in one pint of new milk by 
putting it on the fire in an earthen mug ; beat 
the yolks of six eggs, strain them through 
a sieve, and add them, with six ounces of 
loaf sugar, to the milk. Let it boil, or sim- 
mer, stirring it all the time until it thickens 
like a rich custard. Have the whites beaten 
to a stiff froth; beat the custard from the 
time it is taken off the fire till it begins 
to stiffen, then beat in the eggs and cream. 
Flavor with vanilla, or any seasoning you 
like. Fit the cake to the mould and put 
in the above mixture. 



GOOSEBERRIES, BOTTLED. 

Gather the gooseberries when they are 
young and tender, pick off the bloom and 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

part of the stem, and put them in dry black 
glass bottles. Drive the corks about an inch 
in the neck of the bottles and set them in 
an oven, filled with water as high as the 
neck of the bottles. Set the oven on the 
fire and let the water boil slowly until the 
gooseberries turn a light yellow. Then take 
them off the fire, and Vhen cold drive in 
the corks and seal the bottles. Set them in 
a dry cellar. When you wish to make them 
into tarts put them on a hot fire and stew 
them about fifteen minutes, or until they 
turn a light green. To a quart bottle put 
one pound of loaf sugar, half a gill of water, 
and a piece of alum the size of a partridge 
egg, or one drachm of alum. Fresh goose- 
berries are made into tarts in the same man- 
ner. To a pound of gooseberries put a 
pound of loaf sugar and the same quantity 
of water and alum. Set the corks lightly 
in the bottles do not drive them in.

MINCE MEAT. 

Grind one quart of beef suet fine and add 
one quart of lean beef, boiled and ground 
fine. To this add one quart of apples, 
chopped fine; raisins, one quart, currants, 
one quart, citron, quarter of a pound, sliced 
and chopped and dusted in the flour, al- 
monds, quarter of a pound, blanched and 
chopped fine, one quart of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of ground mace, cloves, and cin- 
namon, one pint of whiskey, one pint of 
sherry wine poured over these ingredients, 
and lastly, one teaspoonful of salt. 



PASTRY. 

To one quart of flour put seven ounces 
of fresh butter and seven of good firm lard; 
mix the flour with as little water as will 
make it adhere together, putting in at the 
same time one-third of the lard and a little 
salt; then roll out the paste into a large 
cake, and put on the lard and butter in little 
dots all over it, fold the paste, and roll it 

( J80 ) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

well again, adding the lard and butter until 
all has been rolled in. It should be rolled 
at least four times. If the paste is to be 
made in the summertime it should be pre- 
pared in the cool of the morning in a pantry 
or some cool place and left on the ice for 
several hours before baking. Pastry for 
apple pies, puddings, etc., is made of six 
ounces of lard and six of butter to the quart. 
Pie crust for chicken pies, oysters, etc., is 
made with ten ounces of butter and lard 
to a quart of flour. The best pastry is made 
in cold weather. Even in the Winter pastry 
should never be made in the kitchen, but 
always in the pantry or some cool room.

RHUBARB FOR PIES. 

Take the stem of the pieplant (rhubarb), 
strip off the thin skin, and cut into pieces 
the size of a gooseberry. Stir in sugar to 
suit the taste, three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to one of fruit should make it sweet 




JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

enough. Season with fresh lemon. Some 
stew the fruit before putting it on the paste ; 
it is better, however, to put it on the paste 
before stewing. Water is unnecessary, as 
a sugar seasoning extracts enough juice. It 
is thought to be better not to strip off the 
skins. 



DRINKS 



DRINKS 

COFFEE. 

Take good Mocha or Java coffee, pick out 
any trash that may be in it, blow off the 
dust, toast it a good brown, turning it (if 
in a toaster) or stirring it (if in a skillet) 
constantly until it is done. Then grind it, 
pour it in the coffee pot, and pour on boil- 
ing water. Set it on the fire and let it boil 
fifteen minutes. Half a pint of toasted un- 
ground coffee will make three pints of 
coffee, that is, put that quantity of water 
to that measure of coffee. Put a teaspoon- 
ful of the white of egg in the coffee after 
putting it in the boiler; pour on two or 
three tablespoonfuls of cold water and mix 
the egg, coffee, and water together.

CORDIAL, BLACKBERRY. 

To one gallon of the juice of ripe black- 
berries put two and a half pounds of loaf 

(185) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

sugar. Cook in a preserve kettle twenty 
minutes; five minutes before it is done, 
put in a very little allspice, mace, and 
cloves, pounded fine. As soon as it is cold 
add one pint of the best old rye whiskey; 
put into bottles, cork tight, and seal with 
beeswax. If you wish it to keep, put in one 
quart of whiskey and three and a half pounds 
of sugar; if brown sugar is used instead 
of loaf, use one quarter of a pound more 
to the pound. 



CORDIAL, RASPBERRY. 

Mix five ounces of Tartaric acid to two 
quarts of water, pour this on twelve pounds 
of raspberries and let it stand twenty-four 
hours; then press the fruit and strain the 
juice through a muslin cloth. To every pint 
of juice put one pound four ounces of loaf 
sugar. Bottle the juice and seal up the 
bottles. It is best to use this cordial the 
Summer it is made, although it will keep 

( 186 ) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

twelve months. Blackberry cordial may be 
made in the same manner. 

999. 

EGGNOG. 

Take one quart of rich milk, one dozen 
large hen eggs, one quarter of a pint of good 
Jamaica rum, and three-fourths of a pint of 
the best whiskey; sweeten to the taste with 
loaf sugar. Beat the yolks until they are as 
light as beating can make them, and add the 
sugar; pour on the rum and whiskey (mixed) 
very slowly, beating the eggs all the time, 
so they will be thoroughly cooked. Now 
stir in the milk and, last of all, stir in one 
pint of whipped cream.

GINGER POP. 

One ounce of ginger, one pound of brown 
sugar, one lemon, and one tablespoonful of 
hot yeast to one gallon .of water. Break 
the ginger up fine, but not into a tartar; 
add it to the rind of the lemon and the 
sugar and pour the water, boiling hot, upon 

(.187) 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

these ingredients. When cold add the yeast. 
Cover the jar and let it stand ten or twelve 
hours, then add the juice of the lemon and 
strain the whole. Bottle it, corking very 
tight, and tie the corks. Lay the bottles on 
one side in a tolerably warm place. The 
third or fourth day they will be fit for use; 
then put them on ice. Do not fill the bottles 
quite up to the neck. 



TEA. 

For making green tea take the purest of 
spring water and boil in the cleanest of 
kettles; the moment the water commences 
to boil take it off the fire and make the tea 
immediately. It should be made in china 
or fine earthenware vessels (it will not draw 
well in a metal pot), and set on a heater 
for ten minutes, not longer. If it is winter 
set the teapot by the fire. One teaspoon 
heaped as full as it can be taken up will 
make two cups (or two-thirds of a pint) of 
strong tea. 

(188} 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

For making black tea take the same quan- 
tity of tea to the same quantity of water. 
Take the water when it has just commenced 
boiling, pour it on the tea, and pour the 
whole into a saucepan lined with porcelain 
and let it boil ten minutes, with the sauce- 
pan covered. 

There is no rule for telling good tea; it 
must be tasted to find out the flavor. Good 
green tea is a dark amber color. 



WINE, BLACKBERRY. 

Gather good ripe blackberries or dewber- 
ries, mash and strain them; to every gallon 
of juice put one quart of water and four 
pounds of brown sugar. Let it stand thirty- 
six hours, stirring occasionally and skim- 
ming off the scum that rises. Then put it 
in a cask or demijohn, putting in the cork 
loosely, and let it stand until the first of 
November. Then pour it off and bottle it. 
Cork the bottles tightly and keep them in 
a dry cellar. 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

WINE, CURRANT. 

Gather perfectly ripe currants with the 
stems on, mash them well with the hand, 
and add to each gallon of currants one quart 
of water. Strain through a strong muslin 
cloth or hair sifter and add three pounds 
of brown sugar to a gallon of the strained 
liquor. Put in a clean cask or demijohn 
and put in the cork or bung lightly. Set 
it in a moderately warm place and after it 
has fermented make the bung or cork tight. 
About the last of October or first of Novem- 
ber pour or draw the wine off carefully, and 
to five gallons put a quart of good French 
brandy. Bottle the wine, cork and seal the 
bottles and set them away in a dry cellar. 



PUNCH "FISH HOUSE." 

Take two quarts of Jamaica rum, one 
quart of French brandy, one quart of lemon 
juice, four gills of peach brandy, two pounds 
of loaf sugar, and fifteen pounds of ice. Add 
as much water as there are quarts of liquor 

(190} 



JANE HAMILTON'S RECIPES 

the ice will make up the rest, enough for 
about fifty people. 

This recipe was presented to Colonel 
Floyd Jones, of the Army, by the famous 
" Fish House " Club in Philadelphia. It has 
been in use since 1530.
