PREFACE. 

The object of the Cosmopolitan Cook and Recipe Book is 
to provide the Public with a cheap but honest and practical 
Cook Book, containing Recipes for the preparation of dishes 
to suit all tastes and purses. 

The compilers of this work have examined a large number 
of Cook Books varying in price from one to five dollars, and 
while they all contained some good Recipes, still they seemed to 
a great extent to be copies of each other, most generally lacked 
the details required to successfully produce the dish required, 
and frequently seemed to be intended for persons of large 
means only — that is, there was no attempt at economy. 

The Recipes contained in this work are practical, Economi- 
cal, and have been tested; many were received from families 
right here at home in response to an invitation, issued to the 
Public by the Publishers, to kindly send us recipes that were 
both practical and economical. How few servants possess 
good Cook Books, owing principally to the large price de- 
manded for them, and yet it is in such hands that a good Cook 
Book would be most serviceable. No excuse now. Not only 
will this Book be sold at a price within the reach of all, but 
anyone lacking the means to purchase one will be presented 
with a copy upon application to the Publishers. 

The Publishers do not realize the cost of this Book at the 
price it is sold, but. the difference is made up by the sums re- 
ceived from the few advertisements found in the work, adver- 
tisements of Houses and articles of known merit, none other 
would be permitted. In addition to cooking recipes we have 
added many valuable ones for domestic use as well as informa- 
tion on subjects and questions arising daily in every household. 
May this Book serve the purpose for which it is issued, is the 
earnest wish of the Publishers, 

DINGENS BROS., 

Buffalo, N. Y.

Excellence was our aim in this work, in all its 
details. This idea has been maintained in seeking 
advertisers. We sought and have obtained only 
houses and articles of the highest standing 
in the community, and our readers can rely upon 
having their wants filled in the various lines repre- 
sented, not only at the lowest market prices, but they 
will there find the largest and most varied stocks to 
be found in the city of Buffalo, to select from, while 
the specialties advertised can be relied upon as to 
quality and merit. The different lines of business 

ARE ALPHABETICALLY ARRANGED.

WILL COITSIST OF 

ECONOMICAL RECIPES. 

WILL OOliTSIST OF 

MORE COSTLY f FARCY RECIPES 

IN BOTH PARTS, HOWEVER, WILL BE FOUND 

NUMEROUS HOUSEHOLD RECIPES,

The. Index to which being very complete, should be 
carefully noted, in order that the reader may be- 
come acquainted with the contents of the

the finding of the recipe desired, we 
have numbered each one, and so indicated them in

THE TABLE. 



THE TABLE. 



BY MRS. E. S. MILLER. 



No silent educator in the household has higher rank than the 
table. Summoned three times a day by the family, who gather 
from their various duties and callings, eager for refreshment of 
body and spirit, its impressions sink deep, and its influences for 
good or ill form no small mean part of the warp and woof o^ 
our lives. Its fresh damask, bright silver, glass and china give 
beautiful lessons in neatness, order and taste; its damask soiled' 
its silver dingy, its glass cloudy and china nicked, annoy and 
vex at first, and then instil their lessons of carelessness and 
disorder. 

An attractive* well-ordered table is an incentive to good 
manners, and being a place where one is inclined to linger, it 
tends to control the bad habit of fast eating. An uninvit- 
ing disorderly table gives license to vulgar manners, and en- 
courages the haste which has proved so deleterious to the 
health of Americans. Should it not, therefore, be one of our 
highest aims to bring our table to perfection in every par- 
ticular ? 

To this end, cleanliness, order and taste must be carefully 
observed. Beautiful damask has no charm if soiled ; but, be 
it ever so old, worn and darned, if white and well ironed it 
commands our respect. Even when no table cloth can be 
afforded, the well-scoured pine table is most welcome, and so 
beautiful in its whiteness that we almost persuade ourselves it 
is better than damask. 

Silver has no attraction if dull and tarnished ; sticky pitcher 
and tea-pot handles, streaked china, murky glass, the molasses 
pitcher dotted with hints of its contents, cruets with necks and 
stoppers dingy and thick with dried condiments, stray crumbs

of bread, and spatters of gravy in the lumpy salt of the smeared 
salt cellars, are almost repugnant. And if, moreover, one 
knows that a similar regime controls the cooking for such a table, 
though the rolls be ambrosia, and the coffee nectar, they cannot 
tempt the appetite. But the most thorough cleanliness will 
not atone for a lack of order. The table-cloth may be clean 
and white, but unless well ironed and laid straight, it is very 
unsatisfactory. Knives, forks and spoons must be in a line, 
and plates must have strict reference to their vis-a-vis. The 
china must be of one kind, and neither nicked nor cracked. 
Then taste must come in for its share. 

The selection of silver and china, glass and damask, gives 
iine scope for its exercise. Let all be of beautiful design, the 
damask particularly, and of as choice a quality as can be 
afforded. Extravagant, " say you?" Then can you not dress 
more simply; and as you purchase a fine engraving or painting 
for the refinement and cultivation of yourself or your children, 
so furnish your table with this beautiful fabric, which is a study 
in its delicate tracery and artistic groupings ? 

In the appointments of the table, very much depends upon 
refined taste. Without it, there may be a stiff bouquet in the 
centre, with flowers fitted together like stones in a mosaic ; 
with it there would be a loose, graceful arrangement of flowers, 
with drooping ferns, leaves and tendrils. Evidences of taste 
in the table are particularly acceptable to us, most deservedly 
so, and always worthy of cultivation, as they take from the 
grossness of indulgence in mere animal appetite. 

Let us give then, to these three graces of the table, cleanli- 
ness, order and taste, the importance which so justly belongs 
to them ; let us provide an abundant supply of wholesome 
food, well cooked and well served, and the hours spent at the 
■table shall aid in our highest development. 



THE TABLE. 



THE BREAKFAST TABLE. 



First see that it stands in the centre of the room, and per- 
fectly straight, for no matter how well arranged, if it stands 
but little out of line, everything looks awry. Then put on the 
cover of canton flannel; this preserves the table-cloth, gives it 
a whiter shade, and deadens sound. 

Have an eyelet hole in each corner to fasten over corre- 
sponding knobs under the ledge of the table; by this means it 
is held in position and cannot be displaced by the table-cloth, 
which comes next in order. In laying the table-cloth be care- 
ful to have the point where the folds cross in the centre, lie 
exactly on the centre of the table. Then arrange the mats > 
they are disliked by the most fastidious, and where the canton 
flannel cover is used, there is less necessity for them. 

Then place the tumblers and napkins at the right hand of 
the places intended for the plates. Then arrange the silver and 
knives, making this square for every plate, viz.: dessert spoon 
for fruit or oatmeal at the right hand, fork at the left, and 
knife with the back of the blade towards the plate, across the 
top. Every large spoon should lie with the handle towards 
the right hand of the person sitting before it. Always place 
the silver right side up ; the inside of a spoon is much more 
beautiful than the outside, and the fork gains nothing by being 
turned over. Then arrange the cups and saucers, sugar, etc., 
on a waiter or not, as you please, but by all means at the end 
of the table in preference to the side. The head and foot of 
the table are for the lady and gentleman of the house. This 
old established rule is sometimes waived for convenience sake 
but the change detracts greatly from the elegant appearance of 
the table. 



IO THE TABLE. 



THE DINNER TABLE. 



In changing the table-cloth during the week, contrive to let 
the fresh one be for the dinner table. Place a large napkin 
over each end of the table to protect the table-cloth during the 
carving; these must be removed when the crumbs are brushed. 
For company dinner, many families prefer using two table- 
cloths, having the upper one removed after the first courses, 
thereby dispensing with brushing the crumbs, and generally 
securing a clean cloth for the dessert. Put on the mats and 
glasses, and as for breakfast, make a square for every plate 
with the knife, fork and soup spoon. If raw oysters are to be 
a part of the dinner, they should be the first course ; select a 
small kind, serve them on the half shell, five or six on a plate, 
with a bit of fresh lemon in the centre. 

The soup is helped by the lady. The rule is one ladleful 
and but one helping; at the end of this course, the soup plates 
are first removed, then the tureen. In handing plates, the 
waiter should always go to the left side of the guest ; plates 
should be removed from the right side. 

The waiting on the table should be as noiseless as possible, and 
the voice of the waiter should never be heard ; if necessary, a 
low tone to the lady is admissible. No reproof should be given 
a servant at table, and no instructions that can possibly be 
avoided. Full directions before every meal should be given 
to an inexperienced servant. The foreign mode of serving a 
dinner is beautiful, and has great advantages over our way. 
The table is handsomely set with glass and silver, fruit and 
flowers. The first course is soup, then comes fish, already 
carved, that you may help yourself with ease. Then there is a 
Filet de Bceuf, part of which is carved, and the whole garnished 
with sliced potatoes, browned ; then a cauliflower or macaroni; 
after that roast fowl and sweet-meats; then a pudding, followed 
by ices and coffee, fruit being the last course. 



THE TABLE. 



The wines being first, a small glass of sherry before the fish; 
then claret: next a fine Sauterne, followed by champagne with 
the fruit. 

The little delay between the courses gives time for pleasant 
conversation, and would be admirable here in preventing our 
fast eating. This custom also saves the cook that last severe 
pressure of serving from four to eight hot dishes at the same 
time. 

No well-ordered house has noisy servants. The house- 
keeping in every department should move like perfect, well- 
oiled machinery, with invisible wheels. Shrieks of laughter 
from the kitchen, singing and calling through the halls, stamp 
a house at once as belonging to the vulgar and uncultivated. 
Let the comforts and luxuries provided for your family and 
guests come to them as by magic; let them hear no preparatory 
sounds, and see no sights, that shall take from them the fresh- 
ness of the entertainment. 



■:o:- 



THE TEA TABLE. 

Set the table without a cover. This is a privilege that 
neither the breakfast nor dinner table can claim, and should 
therefore be cherished as particularly distinguishing the tea 
table. Of a summer's evening the effect is cool and refresh- 
ing, and in the winter its polished surface is rich with the re- 
flection of lights and silver. On some tea tables we find a 
delicately crocheted mat for every plate, the tongue, biscuit, 
etc., placed on white mats of heavier make, and the tea service 
arranged on one large oval mat. Arrange the knife, fork and 
spoon as for breakfast, using a smaller sized plate. Use 
fringed napkins, one lying on each plate. Let the cups be of 
thin china and placed before the lady of the house, the relish 



12 THE TABLE. 



of fish or cold meat before the gentleman, flowers in the centre, 
fruit and biscuit each side, the cake basket between the flowers 
and " tea things," and the butter on the other side of the 
flowers. 

The gathering at the tea table is perhaps one of the most 
social of the day, there being none of the hurry of the breakfast 
table ; and the rest, so charming when contrasted with the 
anxieties, formality and etiquette of the dinner table, comes, 
to the mother especially, as a sweet benediction. 

No soup tureen looms up before her, or heavy, smoking 
joints. These have given way to fragrant tea or delicious 
chocolate, cold tongue, or meats thinly sliced and garnished 
with curled parsley, light and snowy biscuit, sweet golden but- 
ter, and honey in the comb, etc. 

Physicians tell us that the heaviest meal of the day should 
come at noon, when the digestive organs have more vigor than 
at night. We think their counsel good, and a light repast at 
night will make our slumbers more peaceful, our rest more pro- 
found, and leave our heads clear for our next day's duties. 



DUTIES OF THE M^ID OF ALL WORK. 

The general servant must be an early riser. Her first duty,. 
of course, is to open the shutters, and in summer, the win- 
dows of all the lower part of the house. 

Then she must clean the kitchen range or stove, sift the 
cinders, remove the ashes, brush the stove, and rub the bright 
parts with a leather or woolen cloth kept for that purpose. 

She must light the fire, fill the kettle, and as soon as the fire 
burns, set it on to boil. 

She must then clean the room in which the family break- 
fasts, first pinning up the curtains out of the dust.- She should 
let the dust settle for a few minutes, running meantime to the 



THE HOUSE MAID. 



13: 



kitchen to get the breakfast things ready to bring in. In five 
minutes or so, she must return and thoroughly dust all the fur- 
niture, the ledges about the room, the mantel-piece, and all 
ornaments. Not a speck of dust should be left on any object 
in the room Then she lays the breakfast cloth ready for 
breakfast, and shuts the dining or breakfast room door. 

Her next duty is to sweep the hall or passage, shake the 
door mat and clean the door step, and if necessary, polish 
the door plate and door knobs. Then she cleans the boots, 
washes her hands and face, puts on a clean apron, and prepares 
the toast, eggs, bacon, coffee, or whatever is required for 
breakfast; if the family is ready for breakfast, she brings it on 
the table; if the family do not require her to wait on the table, 
she may then go up to the bed rooms, open the windows, strip 
the bed-clothes off, and leave the mattresses or beds open ; by 
this time probably the bell will ring for her to take her break-, 
fast and remove the breakfast things, which she should do 
quickly and carefully; sweep up the crumbs in a dust pan, put 
back the chairs and clean the room. The china is then washed 
and put away, and the kitchen tidied a little. 

Her mistress will then give her orders for dinner. 
As soon as these are settled, she will put on a large clean' 
apron in which to make the beds, that she may not soil the bed 
clothes with her working dress. The mistress of the house 
generally assists a maid of all work in making the beds, but 
this is by no means a right of the maid, and very frequently 
she has this work to do alone. 

In making the beds she should turn the mattresses frequently, 
the sheets being always placed with the marked end towards 
the pillow. 

When the beds are made and the slops emptied, the rooms 
should be carefully dusted. Then she sweeps down the stairs 
and dusts the banisters. She sweeps the dust from each stair 
into a dust pan and is careful that no dust lies about the pas- 



14 THE HOUSE MAID. 



sa^e or hall which she nas already dusted. She next proceeds 
to the sitting room, dusts the furniture, (dusting the ornaments 
is frequently done by the mistress, but cannot always be ex- 
pected.) In winter when stoves are used, they must always be 
first attended to. It is scarcely necessary to mention that great 
care should be exercised in dusting ornaments and to evade 
breaking little keepsakes which are highly prized by the owner 
and which no money can replace. 

The maid then returns to the kitchen, puts on a large canvas 
apron, which will tie all round her and which has a bib, and 
proceeds to cook the dinner. While the meat is roasting or 
boiling, any little kitchen work which will not take her away 
from the neighborhood of the fireplace, may be done. 

Half an hour before taking up the dinner she will set the 
table, following explicitly the directions given by her mistress, 
and serve the various dishes during the meal as her mistress 
may direct; after she has had her own dinner she sweeps, folds 
up the table-cloth, sweeps up the crumbs under the table, and 
if the room is left vacant, opens the windows ; then washes up 
the dishes and plates, cleans the knives, (washing off the grease 
carefully before she rubs them on the knife-board,) washes the 
silver spoons and forks, and just rubs them over with the 
leather, cleans any boots and shoes required, and then cleans 
up her kitchen and goes to wash and dress herself. 

Her next duty is to bring in the tea, make the toast, etc. 

After tea she turns down the beds, sees that there is water in 
the rooms, shuts the windows and closes the blinds. 

These are the ordinary daily duties, but in order that the 
house may be well cleaned, every bed-room should be swept 
once a week, and the tins and silver must have weekly atten- 
tion beyond that of the daily washing. A tidy girl will gen- 
erally wash up the glasses and plates after supper and not leave 
them for the morning ; she should also carefully fasten up the 
house. She should ask her mistress for housemaid's gloves,

is 



and endeavor as much as possible to keep her hands clean, so 
as never to leave smutty marks of fingers on anything she 
touches ; her hair should be banded carefully back and be 
kept smooth and her face clean ; and as she has to answer the 
door, she should wear her coarse apron as much as possible, 
and at a knock or ring, exchange it for a clean white one kept 
within reach. 

Recollect, my little general servant, that if your place is a 
hard one, it is also the best possible one for training you for a 
better one. After all, too, you have not more to do, nor, in 
fact, so much as you would have as the mistress of your own 
home when married, when you would probably have to clean 
house, work for your family's support, and take care of chil- 
dren, besides enduring anxiety and the many cares of the 
mother and wife. In your place you have no care for daily 
bread or clothes, your food and raiment are sure and you have 
every comfort. 

If you rise early, bustle about and waste no spare moments, 
you will get through your work very well, only do think 
about it. A little arrangement and thought will give you 
method and habit — two fairies that will make the work disappear 
before a ready pair of hands If, when you put your head on 
your pillow, you would just plan how best to get through next 
day's work you would find it a great help. 

Try not to forget orders. Do everything as well as 
possible at once. Remember, " Once well done is twice done." 
"A place for everything and everything in its place." 

Be sure to always wash china, that is, cups, saucers, plates, 
etc., in very hot water, and wipe them dry with a very clean, 
dry cloth j a wet, dirty cloth will make them smeary and sticky- 
Find time for your own work of an evening, and take care to 
leave no holes in your stockings or rents unmended. C 'A stitch

going to the wash, you will keep your needlework nicely under. 
Be personally clean, it is the great charm of ladies ; and a 
good wash every night before going to bed will refresh you, 
make you healthy, prettier, and more cheerful than if you fell 
asleep, still dirty from your daily toil. Be active, cheerful, 
good tempered and obliging, and you will find work easy and. 
employers kind. 



THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE. I 7 



THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE 



The Mistress of the House commands daily a small realm of 
which she is queen. Let her rule with justice, meekness and 
quietness. The most self-governed person will always govern 
best, and we should have fewer bad servants if they were all 
under the firm and patient training of an employer who under- 
stood what their duties really were, and who required the best 
fulfillment of them compatible with the frailty of human nature. 

Good Temper, Patience, and a knowledge of domestic 
affairs, come first therefore, in the list of requirements for a 
model housewife. 

A FREQUENT VISIT TO THE KlTCHEN IS VERY ESSENTIAL, for 

there, usually the greatest waste takes place ; this may be attrib- 
uted, not so much to the carelessness and indifference of the 
servants, as to the fact that they do not realize the amount ex- 
pended for that department of the household. The writer had 
in his employ a servant-girl who was thought quite economical; 
a year after her marriage she stated, that while in our employ 
she did not realize how wasteful she was, but now that she had 
a home of her own to provide for, she realized how much food 
cost, and saw where she might have been much more econo- 
mical. 

How and Where to Buy. — Buy of first-class establish- 
ments only. Prices are no higher (quality and quantity con- 
sidered) and frequently lower than establishments that seek a. 
cheap trade, while the goods are sound, unadulterated, healthy, 
first-class, the variety larger, and the goods fresh. Beware of 
establishments who profess to sell cheap and give you prizes 
besides. 



THE WIDOW PRUDENCE. 



PART 1 



WIDOW PRUDENCE'S ECONOMICAL NEW 
ENGLAND RECIPES. 



HER STORY. 



Having been left a widow with six children to support, I had 
to study economy. My husband had been in the wholesale 
fruit business, but the failures of 1857 were the cause of the loss 
of both his life and fortune. Following his death I was 
attacked by a severe illness, during which my family were 
scattered among relatives. After my recovery I again gathered 
them together, resolved that they should not leave me, except 
,-of their own desire ; each one that was able now put all their 
earnings in the household purse. With seven to feed and clothe, 
and rent to pay, it became a duty how to buy the cheapest, 
yet good articles. I bought for cash and invariably of first- 
class houses; the advantages of purchasing from such houses, are 
these: you are sure of full weight, you are sure of pure, fresh, 
sound and uniform goods, while prices are, as a rule, lower 
than at small establishments. In meats the fine cuts are generally 
very expensive, (but the head, feet, heart, liver, tripe and 

COARSER PARTS ARE GENERALLY AS GOOD IF COOKED PROPERLY,) 

and give a greater variety. Many of those now dependent 
upon the corner grocer and butcher who give a very limited credit 
at exorbitant profits, and whose customers are forced to buy just 
what they have, if they would begin to save enough to buy but 
a few articles for cash, they would soon buy all. Why should 
the poor man labor hard all the week, that when Saturday 
night comes he must give one-third of his earnings as profit to 
such small dealers who lead an easy life and get rich off his 
trade ? I give you many recipes for each article, and if you have 



THE WIDOW PRUDENCE. 1 9 

nothing in the house but meal you can make a comfortable 
repast, at least you need not hunger. 

In the selection of goods at large establishments you will 
have but little trouble, for you will deal with men of honor and 
principle as a general thing, who do a large business and are 
above misrepresentation ; there are certain brands that are the 
best and vou will soon find them out and will use no other. 

Sugar. — Use only granulated, for it is the cheapest in the 
end, no drying up, no waste and it is impossible to adulterate it. 

Fruits and vegetables. — Always buy them fresh, clean 
looking, and free from decay, as they vary in quality very 
much. Good judgment is better than advice. 

Fish. — Fish should always be perfectly fresh when cooked. 
To select fresh ones observe the eyes, if they have a bright 
life-like appearance, the fish is fresh ; if on the contrary, the 
eyes are sunken and dark colored, and have lost their brilliancy, 
they are certainly stale. Some judge by the redness of the 
gills, but they are sometimes colored to deceive customers. 
Do not buy any more fresh fish than you want to use for the 
day (except in winter, when they will keep) but the fresher 
the better. 

Meats, poultry ^ game, etc., etc. — The finest grained 
beef is the best. The flesh is of a fine red, and the fat a light 
cream color, but not yellow ; the fat, too, is solid and firm. 
The lean of mutton shoulpl be of a red color, and the fat white. 
The skin of pork should be of a light color, and if young, it 
is tender ; the fat should appear firm. A tender goose is known 
by taking hold of the wing and raising it; if the skin tears 
easily, the goose is tender ; or if you can readily insert the 
head of a pin in the flesh it is young. The same remarks will 
hold good with regard to ducks. Young chickens may be 
known by pressing the lower end of the breast bone; if it 
yields readily to the pressure they are not old, for in all animals 



20 THE WIDOW PRUDENCE. 

the bones are cartilaginous when young. The breast should 
be broad and plump in all kinds of poultry, the feet pliable 
and the toes easily broken when bent back. 



OUR RECIPES. 



All persons who have used Cook Book recipes know, that as 
a rule, they give information to cook only fine rich dishes. 
They dishearten a prudent housekeeper. How can it be other- 
wise when some recipes of a single small dish call for eight to 
ten eggs (at four to five cents a piece, as they are in winter) 
and ounces of dear spices and outlandish herbs and costly 
fruits. Mrs. Prudence having for forty years cooked for a 
large family of her own, and kept a fashionable boarding 
house, now getting old, gives to the world the benefit of New 
England Cooking, with French, English, German, Scotch, Irish 
and other national recipes, that have been used by her and 
improved and cheapened. Her struggle through life to sup- 
port her children caused her to use many of the cheaper foods, 
and her great love for her offspring caused the old lady to make 
them good and palatable, but at the same time healthy. It is 
well known that many, very many families, have nothing but 
dry bread the most of the time; others have but little meat ; 
others are tired of beef, pork, mutton and lamb. They want 
something new ; all parties will find their wants supplied here ; 
many of her cheap dishes are as good as the much more costly 
ones of the modern cook books. 



GUARANTEE. 



We Will Guarantee 

THAT ANY FAMILY 

Will Reduce their Table Expenses One-Half 

BY THESE RECIPES, 
And. have Healthier and Better Dishes, besides Many New Ones 

THAT 

MEYER HAYE BEEN MOWN TO THE PUBLIC. 

THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OF THESE RECIPES IS 

CLASSIPICATIOIT. 



We classify the dishes by the name of the principal food of 
which it is made, and keep them all together, so that one can 
see at a glance which one of that kind they prefer, and if they 
have only Indian corn meal in the house with the few things 
required, they can select from fifty- dishes to suit their palate; 
thus bread, porridge, pudding, cakes, etc. 

Time. — The time is also seen at once ; the time it takes, 
without reading the whole recipe, so that if the cook has not 
time to prepare it one way she can another ; so with meat of 
any kind, it can be cooked to suit the time at one's disposal. 

Articles and Quantity. — The name of each article, and 
its quantity, are given separate, so that the cook, after having 
read the recipe, knows if she has the necessary ingredients, 
or can get them. If so she has but to read the Directions, 
to go on, and then, if she desires to, can reduce the amount 
so as to make less, or increase and make more. 

Our Remarks upon dishes are to give information as to their 
excellence, and for whom they are best adapted, sick or well. 



MILK. 



MILK. 

Is a very common article of food, enters into a great many- 
dishes ; bread, cake, puddings, pies and drinks ; it gives like 
eggs, a rich flavor without being unhealthy. In large cities it 
is apt to be adulterated with water, etc.; to avoid which, many 
use condensed milk, which can be bought of grocers anywhere, 
and has many advantages over common milk. 

Remarks — In the following recipes we have given the time required 
for boiling, based upon the use of a double kettle or boiler (no well-ap- 
pointed kitchen should be without one); many articles of food are easily 
burnt or scorched in cooking when cooked in open pans, and require 
close attention. This difficulty is obviated by the use of the double boiler, 
by some called, oatmeal or farina kettle; be careful and have the outer 
kettle always filled with water. 

I. Boiled Milk. [Time. — Twenty minutes.] 

Article. — Milk, two quarts. 

Directions. — Pour two quarts of milk into your double boiler,, 
have the water in the outer kettle boiling, let the milk remain 
twenty minutes or longer ; it will not burn. 

Remarks. — Boiled is much richer, better, and healthier, than without 
boiling; the chemical action of heat upon milk condenses and solidifies 
it. In too many cases milk sold to families is watered or impure; boiling 
it will correct this in a measure, as all physicians and chemists say that 
water boiled is made purer. The component parts of milk are about 
eighty-seven parts of water ; sugar, five; caseine, five; butter, three ; all 
perishable. When boiled it will keep twice as long. In all recipes for 
cooking, boiled milk should be used where milk is required; although fresh 
milk may be used, the cook will find that the use of boiled milk produces 
richer results. 

2. To Preserve Milk. 

Boil it in a double boiler, add a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
soda to two quarts. 

3. Cocoa Milk. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 
Articles. — Quarter of a pound of cocoa ; a quart of milk* 
Directions. — Put the milk in a double boiler, let it boil,. 

then pour in the cocoa, first powdered and made to a paste* 

Chocolate may be made the same way. 

Remarks. — Cocoa or chocolate is very healthy and nutritious, and for 

children excellent. 



CHOCOLATES. 



4. Cocoa or Chocolate. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 
Articles. — Quarter pound of cocoa or chocolate ; half a 
pint of milk ; water one quart. 

Directions. — Make your cocoa or chocolate into a paste by- 
adding a little hot water to the grated material, then pour your 
boiling water into the double boiler, add the cocoa or choco- 
late and milk, and boil as above. 

5. French Chocolate. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 
Articles. — Three ounces plain chocolate, grated, three 

pints milk, one pint water. 

Directions. — Make your chocolate into a thin and smooth 

paste with a small quantity of hot water ; let your milk and 

water come to a boil, then add your chocolate paste, stirring 

well ; let boil up once ; sweeten to taste. 

6. Rice Milk. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 
Articles. — Rice, ground, a tablespoonful ; milk, a pint. 
Directions. — Boil the milk in your double boiler, then add 

the rice, sweeten and flavor to taste. 

Remarks. — Rice, flour, corn-starch or arrow-root, made in the same 
proportions is as good. Half a teaspoonful of magnesia added will cor- 
rect acidity of the stomach; there is no better food for the sick, feeble, 
children, and infants. 

7. Coffee Milk. [Time. — Twelve minutes.] 
Articles. — Two tablespoonfuls of ground pure coffee ; a 

pint of milk ; water, half a teacup. 

Directions. — Pour the milk into the double boiler, after it 
boils add the coffee, first soaked in boiling water ; let it stand 
covered two minutes ; sweeten to taste. 

Remarks. — This coffee is perfectly delicious. 

8. Improved French Coffee. [Time. — Five minutes.] 
Articles. — A tea cupful of finely ground coffee ; three 

pints boiling water. 

Directions. — Keep your coffee in a tight tin can ; grind it 

only as you need it ; procure a French coffee pot, put your 



:24 MILK. 



-coffee in the upper part, pour the boiling water on it, and let 
it percolate through the coffee; pour it over a second time, and 
the liquid coffee will run through clear and strong ; use boiling 
milk. 

Remarks. — We give no other recipe for preparing coffee, for the 
wretched way of boiling it is not cooking, it is spoiling the aroma of 
coffee, which is all there is of it to drink. A proper combination of 
Mocha and Java, the secret of which some grocers possess, makes the 
ifinest beverage, some use half of each, one-third Mocha and two-thirds 
Java makes a nice combination. Coffee is very stimulating and good for 
those it agrees with. The best is the cheapest, but buy it of first-class 
establishments, especially when buying it roasted or ground.

JELLIES. 

Gelatine and Isinglass. 

Animal Jellies are nutritious and very cheap, if made accord- 
ing to our directions, and are very pleasant to the taste. They 
have been considered very expensive and not hearty. This is 
a mistake. Jellies are the very strength of meat and the vital 
juices, so to speak. Fruit and farina jellies are the same ; try 
them by our directions ; if you do not wish the trouble, pre- 
pared gelatine can be easily purchased at the stores. Animal 
jelly can be made of calf's head and feet, pig's head and feet, 
or cattle's feet. In making jellies the head and feet are good for 
the table, and make a good meal (see recipes for cooking for 
the table), so that the jelly is a clear gain ; only a little trouble 
a trifling expense, and you have a delicacy for well and sick. 
Use the double boiler in preparing them. 

48. Plain Jelly Stock. [Time. — To clean, half an hour ; 

TO BOIL, SIX HOURS ; TO CLARIFY, TEN MINUTES.] 

Articles. — Calves' feet, four, or a calf s head, or a hog's 
head, or four ox heels; pig's feet for either; four quarts of 
water 3 sugar, two ounces ; one egg. 

Directions. — Take either of the above (not all), scald and 
clean them in boiling hot water, knock off the hoofs or horned 
part of feet ; take out the eyes and brains if it is the head. 
Split the feet or head, put them into the pot, add a gallon of 
cold water, boil six hours, or until very tender ; then remove 
with a skimmer ; use no salt or spice in the water (the meat 
can be used for food as directed hereafter). When it is cold, 
skim off every grain of fat ; a gallon of water generally makes 
a quart of jelly, which, after it is cold, must be clarified. 



34 JELLIES. 



49. To Clarify Plain Jelly Stock. [Time.— Twenty 

MINUTES.] 

Articles — Stock, a quart ; one egg ; sugar, two ounces ; 

flavor. 

Directions. — Pour a quart of stock into a double boiler, 

add the white. of an egg, with the shell well beaten together, 

two ounces of sugar, and any flavor preferred • let it boil six 

minutes ; then skim, pour all into a jelly bag, or through a 

piece of cotton cloth, run it into, a bowl or mold. More eggs 

can be added if desired. 

Remarks. — If you wish to make it any flavor, do so while the stock is 
hot. Jellies take their names from the flavor ; lemon, orange, cinnamon, 
etc. The cost of a quart of jelly is but the labor and ten cents at the most ; 
for the meat is woilh all that is paid fcg: it. 

50. Lemon Jelly. [Time. — Altogether, one hour.] 

Articles. — Peel of four lemons and juice ; three glasses of 
sherry ; three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar ; one ounce 
and a half of gelatine or stock ; one pint of water. 

Directions. — Steep the thin peel of four lemons in half a 
pint of boiling water until strongly flavored with the peel. 
Put the sugar pounded with the stock into the double boiler, 
djnd boil it slowly for about a quarter of an hour or twenty 
minutes ; then add the strained lemon juice and the water from 
the peel. Let it just boil up ; skim it well, add the wine, and 
strain it until quite clear. 

51. Orange Jelly. [Time. — About an hour.] 
Articles. — Peel of four oranges and two lemons and juice ; 

2, quarter of a pound of loaf sugar ; a quarter of a pint of water ; 

two ounces of gelatine. 

Directions. — Grate the rinds of the oranges and lemons, 

squeeze the juice of each, strain it, and add the juice to the 

sugar and the water, and boil it until it almost candies. Have 

ready a quart of jelly, put to it the syrup, aud boil it once up. 

Strain off the jelly, and let it stand to settle before it is put 

into the mold. 



JELLIES. 35 



52. French Jelly. 

Articles. — One quart of calves' foot or clear gelatine 1 or 
stock ; some ripe fruit, or any preserved or brandy cherries. 

Directions. — Have ready one quart of very clear jelly, 
select ripe and nice looking fruit, and pick off the stalks ; 
commence by putting some jelly at the bottom of the mold, 
and let it remain about two hours to harden ; then arrange 
some fruit according to taste round the edge of the mold ; if 
currants, lay them in as they come from the tree, on their 
stalks, and pour in more jelly to make the fruit adhere, and 
let that layer also harden ; then add. more fruit and jelly, until 
the mold is full. If peaches, apples, apricots, etc., are used, 
they are better boiled first in a small quantity of syrup ; but 
strawberries, grapes, cherries, or currants may be put in un- 
cooked. An extremely pretty jelly may be made from pre- 
served fruits, or brandy cherries. It may be garnished with 
any fruit, or an open jelly may have some strawberries piled 
in the center, or a whipped cream piled up, with strawberries 
stuck in it, which has a very good effect. 

53. To Make Twenty Kinds of Jelly. 

Take a quart of jelly stock, or make it out of gelatine ; then 
make and add any of the recipes to make ice cream. 

ICE CREAMS, 
Water Ices, Frozen Custards. 

Many families think because ice cream and water ices are 
sold so high in the confectioneries that they must be expensive 
to make. It is a mistake ; it is not so. A variety of food is 
essential to the maintenance of human life. 

Cheap luxuries are also, in moderation, necessary to pleasure 
and enjoyment after a hard day's work. We know of nothing 
more delightful and refreshing than ice cream, for milk, sugar, 
eggs, and fruits are all healthy and very nutritious ; so it is not 
money wasted that you spend for ice cream or water ices. Ices 



36 ICE CREAMS. 



are cheaper, but of course not so substantial. In eating them 

J30 NOT GOBBLE THEM DOWN IN A HURRY, BUT LET THEM MELT 

in your mouth. That is the way to eat them, and we will 
guarantee no one will ever be hurt by eating ice creams or 
^water ices. The swallowing of masses of ice cream upon a 
"heated stomach is enough to make anyone sick, but when it is 
meltecKn your mouth it can not. 

Condensed milk used alone, or in proportion of one part 
water to one part condensed milk, will be found an excellent 
substitute for cream, and much richer. Two or three parts 
water to one of condensed milk, will make good cream. If 
you live where you cannot get it at the door, use the canned 
milk, which does not require sugar. Try it and you will prefer 
it to cream, or common milk. 

Lemon juice makes the flavor taste richer. Sometimes it is 
mot to be put in. It will be stated when. 

54. How to Make Ice Cream. [Time. — From ten to 

TWENTY MINUTES.] 

Articles. — Sweet milk, a pint ; a tablespoonful of sweet 
butter ; white sugar, half a pound; juice of one lemon ; two 
well-beaten eggs (or not); essence, half a teaspoonful, or fresh 
fruit a pint, or syrup of fruit, half a teacupful ; a tablespoonful 
of maizena, or flour, or pure corn starch. 

Directions. — Boil the milk in the double boiler ; add the 
butter, a spoonful of corn starch, maizena or flour, first stirred 
up in a little cold milk ; add to the milk then two well-beaten 
eggs ; let it get cool, then stir in the essence or juice of fruit 
or syrup as directed below ; freeze. Cream is richer than 
milk, but cannot be got readily, and is expensive. Those who 
use cream need no butter or flour. 

55. Frozen Custards 

Are made as above, except using two tablespocnfuls of maizena, 
and boiling all until thick. Flavor and freezing are the same 



CREAMS. 



37 



as ice creams. If you desire, these custards can be made 
■without freezing. 

56. Water Ices 

Are made in the same manner, using ice water instead of 
milk, without eggs, and no boiling. 

57. Fruit Creams, Ices, and Custards. 

Juices direct from iresh fruit are the best and the cheapest 
where parties raise it. Jam your berries or fruit; sprinkle 
half a pound of white sugar over it ; squeeze a lemon over the 
sugar j let it stand one hour, then sift it through a fine sieve, 
or better, squeeze it through a piece of cotton cloth ; then stir 
it well into the cold milk, as prepared for creams and custards, 
or water for ices, and freeze at once. 

58. Spice Creams, etc. 

Steep whole spice in a gill of hot water. Use this instead 
of fruit. Coffee, tea, and chocolate come under this class. If 
whole spice is not to be had, tie up ground in a cloth. 

59. Essence Creams, etc. 

Where essences can be bought they are the handiest ; half a 
teaspoonful to a pint of milk. Custards can be made of any 
of the recipes. We generally use the essences, as they are no 
trouble. 

TO COLOR. 

Ice creams, water ices, jellies, and custards can be made of 
different colors. 

60. Red. 
One ounce of cochineal, one ounce of salts of wormwood, 
one pint of water boiled five minutes ; take it off the fire, add 
three ounces of cream of tartar, one ounce of rock alum ; put 
them in slowly or it will boil over ; add, if to keep, sugar syrup, 
instead of water. 

61. Purple. 

Infuse a pound of mallow flowers in a quart of water six 



3 8 COLORING. 



hours; add a little salt of tartar and strain; it gives a deep purple; 
or boil an hour and add a little huckleberry juice, or use huck- 
leberries or blackberries. 

62. Yellow. 

Use the yolks of eggs, or, for a bright yellow, soak a half 
pound of turmeric root in a pint of alcohol until it is yellow 
enough. Color to suit. 

63. White. 

Use milk, white of eggs, white sugar, and white essence. 

64. Pink. 

Use currants, raspberries, or strawberries, or a little red 
coloring. 

65. Brown. 

Coffee and chocolate creams are brown. 

The different kinds of Ice Creams, Water Ices and Cus- 
tards are made as follows : 

66. Strawberry. 

Take a pint of fresh strawberries, jam them with a spoon ; 
sprinkle half a pound of sugar over them ; then squeeze a good 
sized lemon over it ; add coloring if desired ; let it stand an 
hour ; sift it through a fine sieve, or press the juice through a 
cloth ; if the sugar has not all melted, stir it up in the fruit, 
add half a teacupful of water, then stir this juice into the cold 
prepared cream and freeze at once. If you have no fresh 
strawberries, use the canned ones, or essence, or syrup, as 
above directed. 

67. Raspberry. 

Made same as strawberry. A delicate dish, and pink. 

68. Blackberry. 

Made same as strawberry. As healthy a cream as made.

86. Ice Cream Freezers. 

There are now in the market many ice cream freezers that 
will freeze ice cream inside of five minutes, and sold so low 
that any family can buy one. They rarely get out of order, 
and last for many years. By the use of one of these the pro- 
cess of freezing is rendered so much more expeditious and sat- 
isfactory as to more than compensate for the trifling expense 
involved in its purchase. They all have the wooden tubs to 
hold the salt and ice. 

87. Directions for Freezing 

Always accompany them, but we give the following directions 
so that you will always have them, and if you do not have a 
freezer, you can do so by using a tin pail and a bucket. A 
quart of ice cream can be frozen, taking care that there are no 
holes in the freezer to let in the water and spoil the cream. 
Set the freezer, containing the cream, in a wooden tub or 
bucket several inches larger, and pack closely around its sides 
a mixture of pounded ice and salt (mixed in the proportion of 
six pounds of ice to one of salt), extending to within two 
inches of the top of the freezer ; cover the freezer and keep it 
in constant motion, removing the cover frequently (if it does 
not clean itself as some do) to scrape the congealed cream or 
ice from the sides with a silver spoon or wooden paddle, taking 
care to keep the sides clear, and stirring it well to the bottom. 
Keep the tub well filled with salt and ice outside the freezer, 
and take care that none of the salt water gets in to spoil the 
cream. The outside tub or bucket should have a hole in or 
near the bottom, from which the bung can be removed to allow 



MAIZENA. 41 



the water to pass out as the ice melts. After the cream is well 
frozen, it may be packed in molds, and set in salt and pounded 
ice. When you wish to serve it, wrap the mold with a hot 
cloth a minute, so as to loosen it ; turn out the cream on a dish 
and serve immediately. 

MAIZENA. 
It is the farinaceous product ot corn. It affords many deli- 
cate, nourishing, attractive, and palatable dishes, suitable fcr 
'the use of invalids and children, and family use. In custards 
for thickening it is preferable to wheat flour. It is the best pud- 
ding any cook can make. With a paper of this in the house, 
.and some milk and sugar, and an egg or two, a pudding or 
cake can be had in a few minutes, easy of digestion, a luxury, 
and very nutritious. It must always be boiled in the double 
boiler, to prevent burning, as it is very liable to scorch, and, 
as the flavor is delicate, be spoiled. In adding the maizena to 
the milk, it must be first wet in cold milk ; this prevents its 
being lumpy ; powdered sugar is best to use with it.

CORN STARCH, 

Like the maizena, is the product of Indian corn, and deservedly 
ranks high as an article of luxurious yet cheap food. It is all 
nutriment, and differs from maizena in the manufacture ; both 
are good ; try both ; same recipes for both. 

Corn starch has a peculiar thickening property in itself, and 
owing to being cheap and hearty, should be extensively used 
for custards, blanc mange, creams, jellies, gravies, omelets, 
soups for children and invalids, and the well. 

The preparation of maizena and corn starch is very simple, 
when the double boiler is used, giving no care or trouble about 
burning or spoiling. 

Corn starch must be first mixed in a little water or milk

106. General Recipe for Making Creams of Corn 

Starch. 

Articles. — Corn starch, a tablespoonful, more or less ; 
sugar, four tablespoonfuls, or more if desired ; milk, a quart ; 
butter, a teaspoonful ; yolks of eggs, from one to ten, as may 
be preferred ; juice of lemons and juice of fruits, essences, or 
other flavoring that may be preferred. 

Directions. — Heat the milk and sugar in a double boiler, 

mix the corn starch in a little cold milk, add the yolks of the 

eggs well beaten, the butter and juice of lemon and fruit juice 

or essences, etc. 

Remarks. — Creams are eaten cold, and if desired thin use less corn 
starch ; if thick, more. The thin is generally whipped to a froth, and 
poured into glasses to eat, or poured over fruits, preserves, jams, etc. The 
combination is delicious. If thick, pour into molds. 

107. General Recipe for Making Corn Starch Jellies. 

[Time. — To make, about ten minutes.] 

Articles. — Three to four tablespoonfuls of corn starch, or 
maizena, one quart of sweet milk, or a half a pint of condensed 
milk, and three half pints of water, or a quart of water ; 
sweeten to taste with sugar, less than a teacupful will do ; half 
a pint of wine improves the jelly. Fruits, essences, spices, 
juices of lemons, oranges, etc., can be used to flavor, same as 
for ice creams and frozen custards. 

Directions. — Boil the milk or water and sugar in a double 
boiler, mix the corn starch in a little cold water, pour into the 
boiler and let it boil five minutes. Stir it up, flavor with any 
fruit, essence, etc., to suit the taste ; color with any color, same 
as for ice creams ; two or more colors can be made by dividing 
the jelly, and coloring one part ; turn it into the mold. Let it 
cool; then pour in another part with a different color. 

Remarks. — These jellies are very cheap, eabily made with a double 
boiler and nutritious and healthy for invalids, children, and well persons. 
A little practice will enable the cook to make them perfect. Molds of 
crockery and metals can be bought cheap.

turn it upside down on a dish and remove the mold ; the cake 
only is seen. 

EGGS. 
We have fifty good recipes to cook eggs. We give some of 
the plain ones, and shall in Part II. give the rest. Eggs in; 
summer are very cheap, especially in the country, and we know 
of no better dish than well-cooked eggs. They can be cooked 
for the invalid to digest in an hour, and the hearty man to 
digest in five hours ; they contain a great deal of nutriment, 
and strengthen the sick and well. In cooking eggs the best 
way is to break them separately in a cup, for one bad one will 
spoil all that have been broken before. Always serve hot. As 
they are cheap and plentiful in summer, and scarce and dear in 
winter, it is best to save them for the time when they are 
expensive. 

117. To Preserve Eggs. 
There are several ways to preserve eggs, but they must in all 
cases be prepared fresh or new laid, otherwise they will not 
keep, no matter how they are prepared. The principle Qf pre- 
serving is to keep them fresh, cool, and in the dark. 

118. To Preserve with Mucilage. 

Dissolve the gum arabic in water to any ordinary thin paste, 
and dip the eggs in it twice; when dry, which is in a few 
minutes, lay them away in charcoal dust or bran, or dry saw- 



50 EGGS. 

dust ; put the box in a cool, dry closet or cellar, small end 
downward. 

119. To Preserve with Mutton Fat. 

Melt the suet, dip them in it twice — do not have the suet 
too hot — and follow the above directions. 

120. To Preserve with Lime. 

To ten quarts of water, add two pounds of salt and two 
ounces of saltpeter ; boil together for twenty minutes ; when 
nearly cold, add eight ounces of quick lime ; let it stand three 
days, stirring it every day ; place the small end downward in 
layers in a jar ; when filled pour in the mixture. They will 
keep for months ; the water should cover them two inches. 

Do not remove the eggs, when packed for preservation, until 
you wish to use them, as eggs are of a delicate nature, and 
easily spoiled after being kept some time. 

121. Poached Eggs. [Time. — Three minutes.] 
Articles. — Eggs ; butter ; water, a pint ; vinegar, a table- 
spoonful ; a little salt. 

Directions. — Put the vinegar and salt in the water in the 
double boiler ; let it boil, break and pour the eggs in, boil 
three minutes and take out. Butter them and serve on toast, or 
heat some cream, or mock cream, and pour over them. 

122. To Bake Eggs. [Time. — Five minutes.] 
Butter a dish, break the eggs, pour in pepper, salt, and butter; 

bake in a slow oven until well set. Serve hot. 

123. To Boil Eggs. 

T IME . — To boil mealy, fifteen minutes ; very hard, ten 
minutes ; hard, seven minutes ; soft, four minutes ; very 
soft, two minutes. 

Directions. — Have the water boiling ; place the eggs in 
with a spoon, or in a wire-basket ; keep them boiling, as above 
directed. Boiling water, poured on eggs in a bowl, will cook

arately in hot water in a flat dish ; let them stay three minutes, 
or until the white coagulates. Serve on toast. Good for the 
sick and well. 

125. To Fry Eggs. [Time. — Three minutes.]

There is no vegetable that grows that can be raised so easy, 
and that is sold so cheap. Any yard or garden that has a few 
feet in it to spare, can raise all a family wants ; they are very

CHEESE. 

Cheese is another cheap food, cheap for the amount of nutri- 
ment in it ; it is not the quantity as. much a*s the quality that 
gives nutriment. It is a fact, the poorer a cheese, the more 
muscle-making power it has ; chemical analysis giving it the 
greatest amount of all food, especially skim milk cheese. 
Dyspeptics or those confined to the house, or costive persons- 
must not use cheese as it is very binding ; for those whose di- 
gestive organs are strong, and work hard, it is good, or for those 
who do not feel any bad effects after eating it. Persons should 
eat nothing that disagrees with them.

SALT FISH. 
There is much nourishment in fish — almost as much as in 
meat, pound for pound — also, medicinal properties, such as 
iodine, in them, which have a beneficial effect upon the health. 
In no class do we see so large families, handsome women, and 
robust, active men, or greater exemption from maladies. than 
among fishermen and their families. As salt fish are easily 
procured in any part of the country, and generally at a low 
price, we give many good and practical recipes, how to pre- 
pare them. Any dry, salt, pickled, or fresh fish will answer to 
cook. Codfish, however, is the best. Dry or pickled fish can 
' be kept almost any length of time in a cool place. 

151. The Best way to Soak Salt Fish. 
Soak that intended for use in plenty of tepid water, adding 
to each gallon of water a teacupful of vinegar, if the fish is very 
dry and hard ; use a tablespoonful of saleratus or soda to a 
gallon of water ; taste one of the flakes to ascertain when it is 
sufficiently fresh ; too much soaking will render the fish too 
insipid. Pickled fish must be soaked over night, flesh side down. 
152. To Cook Fish. [Time.— An hour or two, accord- 
ing TO SIZE.] 
Nothing is better to cook salt fish in than a double boiler, 
as it must be heated gradually, and, simmer very gently ; boiling 
will make the fish hard and tough. It is generally to be picked 
in flakes free from bones and skin.

POTATOES. 

Plain and sweet potatoes are roots, and are extensively used 
among all classes. They are, when mealy, light, nourishing, 
palatable, and healthy ; but two-thirds of the potatoes are 
watery ; and require different methods of cooking them from the 
ordinary way of boiling. When bought, if over fifty cents 
a bushel is paid, they are not profitable as compared with 
meal and flour ; yet for a change it is well to have some once 
or twice a week ; but potatoes at a dollar a bushel are dear 
food, at two dollars they are extravagant. Many families never 
save their cold potatoes ; it is a mistake, for many of the best 
recipes require* cold cooked potatoes. Potatoes are improved 
by soaking in cold water over night, or for an hour or two 
before cooking.

slower the better j if the water boils too fast, set it further off 
from the fire. Try with a fork ; when done, pour off the water, 
put the pot on the stove, the cover off to dry the potatoes ; 
serve hot as soon as dry. Never let the water stop boiling, as 
it makes them watery.

or two ; boil as above. 

179. To Bake Potatoes. [Time. — One hour.]

one minute and put them again in the colander ; salt them and

BEANS AND PEAS 

Are among the best and most nutritious of foods, and for the 
amount of nourishment and strength they give, to the actual 
cost of them, are among the cheapest of foods. A quart swells 
to over two quarts ; if old, they require more soaking. Add a 
little salt to the water in which they are soaked. These recipes 
answer for dry and fresh beans and peas. 

They are too hearty for dyspeptics, and should not be eaten 
by those of weak stomachs. 



BAKED BEANS. 67 



The New England people eat them often, and especially 

every Sunday morning, and for dinner that day or the next.

the animals are used, nothing is wasted, and it will be so here as 
soon as people understand how to cook them. This is most 
important, and when the wife or cook can make a wholesome, 
palatable dish at a saving of from one-half to three-quarters in 
price, it is her duty to do it, and save money.

ADULTERATION IN FOOD AND DRUGS. 




DULTERATION IN FOOD AND DRUGS has 
become so alarmingly prevalent that the only real 
safety to the consumer lies in the determination to 
patronize only houses of well-known reputation and 
reliability, avoiding &11 the cheap place?., for where 
you find a business man advertising to sell at un- 
reasonably cheap prices you may rest assured there 
is a reason for his action which he does not care to 
disclose. In food and medicines the best is the 
©<,_^/ cheapest. A fair price for an honest article 
is all any house of reputable standing will ask, and what is the saving of 
a few cents as compared with the preservation of health and strength ? 
In drugs and medicines it is doubly important that absolute purity 
should be the standard of the dealer, for life itself often depends upon 
the virtue and efficacy of the medicines prescribed by the physician. In 
view of this fact Messrs. George I. Thurstone & Co., the well-known 
Druggists of 416 Main street, Buffalo, N. Y., have always kept in mind the 
maxim that " Quality in medicine is of the first importance." While they 
do not charge their customers FANCY PRICES they believe that the public is 
willing to pay a reasonable price for a perfectly pure article, and 
their success and popularity is no doubt attributable in a large measure to 
this fact. In addition to the purity of the medicines sold by them, the 
care and attention given by their corps of competent clerks in the pre- 
scription department to the compounding of Physicians' Prescriptions, is 
reassuring to the patron, as all possibility of a mistake is precluded, so 
systematic are the arrangements of this department in all its details. 
Messrs. Thurstone & Co. also have a full stock of the latest styles and 
most improved patterns in Trusses, Shoulder Braces and Supporters, as 
well as a large line of Toilet Articles, including Brushes, Combs, Face 
Powders, Handkerchief Extracts, Colognes, Sponges, Chamois, Pungents, 
Atomizers, etc., and in fact everything usually kept in a first-class drug 
store. Upon all these articles, as in the case of drugs and medicines, 
they adopt the principle of Quality and a fair, reasonable price for 
first-class reliable goods.

Hams, Shoulders, and Bacon. 

HOW POOR ONES ARE MADE GOOD BY COOKING. 

Hams, shoulders, bacon, and pickled pork are very econo- 
mical and handy dishes, but they are so hearty that a person can 
not eat much ; properly cooked, however, they are a luxury. By 
our mode of cooking, a common ham or shoulder is made as good, 
as the best sugar-cured ones. Never buy them unless warranted 
sweet. 

349. To Prepare Smoked and Salt Hams, Shoulders > 

and Bacon for Cooking. 

Soak from twenty to fifty hours, according to the size, in 
three pails of water ; trim neatly, removing any rusty parts — 
this soaking opens and fills the pores of the meat, which salting,, 
smoking, and drying has hardened, and which cooking, with- 



HAMS, ETC. 



out long soaking, does not fill. By this process much waste is 
prevented. Try it, and this one recipe will pay for the book. 

350. To Steam Ham, Shoulders, and Bacon. [Time.— 

About six hours.] 
Directions. — After preparing as above, put over some boil- 
ing water in a pot, in which you have put an ounce of whole 
cloves, an ounce of allspice, an ounce of pepper ; then put the 
meat in a steamer, cover tight and steam until tender ; eat hot 
or cold. 

351. To Boil Hams, etc. [Time. — Five or six hours.] 
Directions. — Prepare the ham as above, pour in enough 

water in a pot to cover the ham, add half an ounce each of 
whole cloves, allspice, mace, and nutmeg, half a pound of 
sugar ; boil until the skin peels and it is tender ; as the scum 
rises skim it off carefully ; take off the pot and let it cool in 
the liquid until cold ; remove the skin whole. If to eat hot, 
of course take it out before cooling. 

352. To Bake a Ham, etc. [Time.— Five hours.] 

Directions. — Prepare it as above ; cover it over with a quite 

thick paste, then put it in a pan, bake it in a moderate oven 

until done, basting it frequently ; the flour prevents its drying 

up ; when done, remove the crust and skin ; serve hot or cold. 

353- To Bake, Boil, etc., a Ham. 

Prepare and boil a ham as above directed for boiling three 

hours, no longer; then put it in a moderate hot oven from 

the pot, and bake it two hours more. This gives a fine flavor 

to the ham. 

Remarks. — Any family once using the above recipes to cook hams, 
shoulders, bacon, and pickled pork, will use no other. We have repeatedly- 
tried the most inferior hams this way, and then tried the old way with the 
best cured hams, costing much more, and found the common hams the best. 

354. Ox Tail Soup. [Time.— Two hours.] 
Articles. — One ox tail, white or Russia turnips, onions*, 
potatoes, carrots, salt, pepper, and flour. 



MEATS. 



Directions. — Ox tail makes a rich soup, rich in strength

it, put it in the soup pot, cover with cold water and heat it slowly; 

as the scum rises to the top skim it off until all is removed ; 

when boiled two hours to a gallon of soup, peel and slice six 

white or two Russia turnips, six large onions or mose small 

ones, also a dozen Irish potatoes; and two carrots ; add salt 

and pepper to taste ; when almost done add flour, beaten up in 

water, strain, boil up, then remove and serve.

roll it round, and bind it with a wide piece of tape. Have 
ready a stew pan of scalding water, put in the beef, and when 
it simmers allow five hours for ten pounds of meat. When 
sufficiently done, drain off the water in which it was boiled, 
and pour cold water over it for six or eight minutes, drain it 
on a sieve reversed, and then place it on a board with a weight 
on it to press the meat well. Then remove the tapes, trim it 
neatly, and serve it when required.

General Recipes for Cooking Meats, etc. 

We give some general rules for soups, stews, roasting, baking, 
"boiling, and frying n eits. 

363. Soups 

Are a compound of meats and vegetables, or meats and vegeta- 
bles separately. Soups are called by the name of the principal 
meat or vegetables of which they are made. Meats should always 
be put into cold water for soups, healed gradually, and boiled 
gently. This converts nearly all the goodness of the meat into 
the soup. Soups are cheap, healthy, and nutritious, can be 
made out of the liquors that meats are boiled in, or shins and 
coarse pieces of meat, and are just as good. All kinds of veg- 
etables, also rice and barley, are used to suit the taste. 

364. Stews 

Are similar to soup, but much thicker and richer ; less water 
makes a stew. 

365. Roasting 

Is simply turning the meats before a fire until cooked. As it is 
very seldom done, we will only say that it is a good method, 
but we do not think it worth so much trouble, if you have a 
srood oven, which will roast as well, and is more convenient. 



Io8 MEAT'S. 



366. Baking is more Economical. 

All cooking in range, stove, or any oven, is baking ; there- 
fore meats cooked in an oven is baking. Meats should be put 
on a grate in a pan to raise them an inch from the bottom of 
the pan, pouring in a pint of salted water to keep the oven moist ; 
bake slowly and steadily and baste frequently with the gravy \ 
the gravy is good plain, or mixed with flour, and can be sea- 
soned to taste. 

367. Boiling 

Either salt or fresh meats, is a good way to cook them ; boil 
them tender, if fresh ; to be cooked whole, drop them in hot 
water ; if corned, drop it in warm water. The first closes the 
pores of the meat, the second draws out the salt. Corned beef 
is a healthy dish. 

368. To Broil Beef Steak, Veal Cutlets, Pork and 

Mutton Chops, Liver, Fowl and Game. 

Grease the bars of your gridiron (use the kind that turns 
over instead of turning the meat), place the meats on it, and 
broil over a hot coal fire ; cut the meats one-half an inch thick ; 
do not stick a fork in them while cooking, as it allows the 
juice to run to waste. The meats should not have too much 
fat on them. After they are done lay in a hot dish (if not 
done return to the gridiron at once). Salt and pepper to taste. 
Spread on good sweet butter ; recollect, serve and eat hot. 
This is the pfain way of broiling any kind of meat, fowl, or 
game. Before* broiling or frying livers or hearts, soak in salt 
and water a few minutes if preferred. 

369. To Fry Steaks, Chops, Cutlets, Fowl, Game, etc. 

A large deep wrought-iron frying-pan is best. Always let 
the fat be hot before putting in the meat (I prefer salt pork fat 
fried out of clear salt pork to any other); lard, oil, or butter 
can be used. Have enough to cover the meat. All meats except 
beef should be well cooked. 



FRYING, ETC. IC9 



Watch the meat carefully, and turn often, so that it does not 
burn. Salt and pepper to taste ; but do not salt until the meats 
are done ; salt hardens meats. Spread sweet butter over the 
meats hot. Put on a hot dish. Persons who like onions can 
cut up one or more, fry and cook in the gravy. 

370. Semi-Frying, or Broiling in the Frying-Pan. 

Heat the pan very hot, grease it, lay in it the meat, turning 
it frequently until done ; finish as above. 

371. Frying Covered Meats. 

Roll the meats in flour, meal, or bread crumbs, shaking off 
what will not adhere, and cook as above. Tomatoes, mustard, 
vinegar, wine, or any seasoning may be used. 

372. Cutlets, Steaks, Chops, Beef's Heart, Liver, 
Tripe, etc., With Tomatoes. 
A pint of canned or whole tomatoes, an onion, a tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, salt and pepper to taste, a tablespoonful of butter, 
and three of fine bread crumbs and a tumbler of hot water. 
Let these simmer gently together, while the meat is being fried 
or broiled ; take them out when done ; pour the tomatoes over 
them. 

373. Hashes, Entrees of Cold Meats. 

All meats left over, also potatoes, will make good entrees, 
hashes, etc. 

374. To Make Good Hashes, 
Take out all the bones, and leave only one-quarter of fat to 
three-quarters of lean meat. Onions, parsley, pepper and salt 
to taste ; chop all fine, heat up well and serve hot. 

375. Cold Meats 

Are often as good as hot eaten with a salad, or maitre d' hotel 
sauce. 

376. Entrees of Cold Meats, etc., 

Are made in almost any style to suit the taste, by slicing and 
warming them in sauces or gravies, spiced and seasoned highly. 



IIO MEATS. 



377. Forcemeats, 

Or stuffings for poultry, and game, meats or vegetables, can be 
made of ham or bacon suet, veal, oysters, bread crumbs, soaked 
b>read, or eggs ; any spice or sweet herbs to taste. 

A selection can be made from any of the above list and 
flavor as desired. Sometimes .milk, butter, wine, and brandy, 
are used. Onions are used with bread to stuff geese, ducks, or 
strong game. 

Any meat or vegetables can be stuffed, and, by using good 
taste, can be improved.

BAKED AND BOILED PUDDINGS. 

Puddings are generally cheap, and a healthy food, nutritious 
and agreeable to the taste. 

For boiled puddings you will require either a mold or a 
pudding-cloth ; the former should have a close-fitting cover, 
and be rubbed over the inside with butter before putting the 
pudding in it, that it may not stick to the sides. A pudding- 
cloth must be kept very clean, and in a dry place. Bread, 
flour, and meal puddings should be tied very loosely as they 
swell very much in boiling. 



Il6 PUDDINGS. 



The water must be boiling when the pudding is put in, and 
continue to boil until it is done. If a pudding is boiled in a 
cloth, there must always be water enough to cover the pudding ; 
but if boiled in a tin mold it is best not to let the water quite 
reach the top. When the pudding is done, take it out from 
the water, plunge whatever it is boiling in, whether cloth or 
mold, suddenly into cold water ; then turn it out immediately ; 
this will prevent its sticking. If there is any delay in serving 
the pudding, cover it with a napkin, or the cloth in which it 
was boiled ; but it is better to serve it as soon as removed from 
the cloth, basin or mold. 

Bread or rice puddings require a moderate heat for baking ; 
batter or custard require a quick oven. The time needed for 
cooking each particular pudding is given with the recipe. 

Eggs for puddings are beaten enough when a spoonful can 
be taken up clear from strings. 

Souffles require a quick oven. These should be made so as 
to be done the moment they are required for serving, otherwise 
they will fall in and flatten.

MAKING CAKES. 



MAKING AND BAKING CAKES. 

Cakes are luxuries not necessities, and, where fat, butter and 
spices are used are generally expensive, indigestible, and un- 
healthy ; yet civilized life seems to demand them and pay the 
penalty for eating them by sickness, loss of health, time, and 

money. We give the best known general directions for cooking 
that can be followed with confidence. 

An oven to bake well should have a regular heat throughout, 
b>ut particularly at the bottom, without which bread or cakes 
will not rise or bake well. 

An earthen basin is best for beating eggs or cake mixture. 

Cakes should be beaten with a wooden spoon or patent cake 
Theaters. Butter may be beaten with the same. 

Eggs should be beaten with a broad fork ; or use the patent 
egg beaters ; they cost but little, and are the best. Eggs should 
b>e clean and fresh for a cake. It is well, as a general rule in 
cake making, to beat the butter and sugar (which must be made 
fine) to a light cream ; indeed, in the making of pound cake, 
the lightness of the cake depends as much upon this as upon 
the eggs being well-beaten ; then beat the eggs and put them 
with the butter, and gradually add the flour and other ingredi- 
ents, beating it all the time. 

In common cakes, where only a few eggs are used, beat them 
until you can take up a spoonful clear from strings. 

In recipes in which milk is used as one ingredient, either 
sweet or sour may be used, but not a mixture of both. 

Sour milk makes a spongy, light cake ; sweet milk makes a 
cake which cuts like pound cake. 

In making cakes, if you wish them to be pleasing to the 
palate, use double-refined sugar, although light brown sugar 
makes a very good cake. 

To ascertain whether a cake is baked enough, if a small one, 
take a very fine broom straw and run it through the thickest 



122 CAKES. 



part ; if not done enough, some of the dough, or unbaked 
dough, will be found sticking to it; if done, it will come out 
clear. Cakes to be kept fresh, should be placed in a tin box 
tightly covered, in a cool dark place. 

Other recipes for cake will be found in the corn starch, 
maizena, and cocoanut recipes.

Directions. — Beat the butter with sugar to a cream, add the 
beaten egg, rub the tartar in the flour, dissolve the soda in the 
milk, add it last ; bake in a flat pan in a quick oven ; when done

PASTRY AND PIES. 

We could all exist without pastry or pies, and no doubt live 
longer, healthier, and become wealthier, and we do not advise 
their indiscriminate use, yet plain pastry (for the mischief is 
caused by rich paste) in pies would do no particular harm. 

First, the cook should have smooth, cold hands, very clean, 
for making paste or crust. She should wash them well, and 
plunge them in cold water for a minute or two, in hot weather, 
before beginning her paste, first drying them well. 

The pastry slab, if possible, should be made of marble ; but 
a wooden paste-board will do. They should be kept scrupu- 
lously clean.

PASTRY AND PIES. 127 



The crust used for common pies may be made of clarified 
beef dripping, or lard, instead of butter. 

Be careful about the proper heat of the oven for baking pies, 
as, if it be too cold, the paste will be heavy and have a dull 
look ; if too hot, the crust will burn before the pie is done. 

Try if the oven is hot enough by holding your hand inside 
of it for a few seconds ; if you can do so without snatching it 
out again quickly, it is too cold. It is best, however, to try 
it by baking a little piece of the crust in it first. 

Always make a hole with a knife at the top of the pie to 

allow the gases, generated in it by cooking, to escape. This 
aperture is also useful for pouring gravy into meat pies when 
done, if more is required. The hand of a pastry cook should 
be light, and the paste should not be worked more than is abso- 
lutely required for mixing it. 

We give first a plain recipe for pie crust, such as people of 
small means can use and will find good. A puff paste, and one 
which will be found good enough for all ordinary purposes, of 
butter, flour, and eggs made stiff, will also suit raised pies. 
Use spices to suit the taste. 

We begin by giving instructions for clarifying house fat so 
as to render it fit for use. 

428. To Clarify House Fat. 

Put the fat in a pan, fry it out, then peel some raw potatoes, 
slice them in it, fry them brown, pour boiling hot water in the 
fat, let it all boil half an hour, then strain fat and water, and 
all the small impurities drop down into the water. 

This fat is good for anything, except cake. Mix all kinds, 
mutton, beef, pork, or ham fat, all together ; only it must be 
sweet. 
429. To Make Hygienic Pie Crust. [Time. — Fifteen 

MINUTES.] 

Equal quantities of flour, graham flour, and cornmeal ; rub 



128 PIE-CRUST. 



evenly together, and wet with sweet cream or milk ; use same 
as other paste. This is excellent for the dyspeptic and feeble ; 
as a change, good for all. 

430. Plain Pie Crust or Paste. [Time. — Ten minutes. 1 
Articles. — Flour, a pound ; fat, four ounces, and water. 
Directions. — Put the flour into a bowl and work it into a 
smooth paste with water; divide the fat into four parts; roll 
out the paste ; put over it in rows one portion of the fat in 
pieces the size of a bean ; flour it, fold over the edges, and 
again roll it ; repeat the whole again three times, dredging a 
very little flour over the paste, and rolling thin each time ; do 
not touch with your hands any more than you can help ; use a 
large knife or spoon ; use ice water ; do this in as cool a place 
as possible. 

431. A French Puff-Paste. [Time — Ten minutes.] 
Articles. — Flour, a pint ; butter, a pound ; two eggs ; one 
lemon, and a pinch of salt. 

Directions. — Pour the flour into a bowl ; make a hole in 
the center of it, in which put the yolks of two eggs, the juice 
of the lemon, salt, and ice- water, and a quarter of the butter 
into a paste ; dredge the board and rolling-pin with flour ; roll 
out the paste very thin ; put little pieces of butter on the paste ; 
fold over three times, still buttering (as the butter separates the 
paste and forms the flakes); do so three times ; this forms nine 
flakes; keep it cool, and at each turning let it cool, if con- 
venient in a refrigerator, a few minutes. 

432. To Make Other Pastes. 

The above is the way to make paste. Any amount of butter 
or fat, not to exceed pound for pound, may be used ; lemon 
juice and eggs may be omitted. 

433. Sweet Apple Pie. 

Pare mellow sweet apples, and grate them upon a grater (a 



PIES. V2() 

very large grater is necessary for this purpose). Then proceed 
as for pumpkin pie. 

434. Sour Apple Pie. 

Take nice tart apples, slice them ; add cinnamon. Fill the 
under crust an inch thick ; sprinkle sugar over them ; add a 
spoonful or two of water. Cover with a thin crust, and bake 
three-quarters of an hour, in a. moderate oven, 

435. Mock Green Apple Pie. 
To five soda-crackers add five cups of boiling water ; cover 
in a dish, let them soak; add three full cups of sugar, two 
lemons — grate the rind, and add both rind and juice. Bake 
with two crusts. 

436. Mock Apple Pie. 

One large grated lemon, three large soda crackers, two even 
tablespoonfuls of butter, two teacupfuls of sugar, one egg, a 
wine-glassful of water, poured over the crackers. These will 
make two pies. Bake with two crusts. 

437. Apple and Pie-Plant Pie- 
Equal quantities of apple and pie-plant made in the same 
manner as all pie-plant, make excellent pie. 

438. Pie-Plant Pie. 

Remove the skin from the stalks ; cut them into small pieces ; 
fill the pie dish evenly full ; put in plenty of sugar, a teaspoon- 
ful of water ; dredge a trifle of flour evenly over the top, cover 
with a thin crust, and bake the same as apple pie. 

439. Pumpkin Pie. 

Select a pumpkin which has a deep rich color, and firm, 
close texture. Stew and sift it. Boil some milk in the double 
boiler, and add enough to make it thin. Sweeten w>th equal 
quantities of sugar and molasses, and bake about one hour in 
a hot oven ; add ginger or nutmeg to taste. 



13° PIES. 

440. Squash Pie. 

This is superior to pumpkin, as it has a richer and sweeter 
flavor. It is made in precisely the same manner as pumpkin 
pie. Eggs and nutmeg can be added. 

441. Sweet Potato Pie. 

Boil and sift through a colander any sweet potatoes, add 
milk boiled in the double boiler, and make the same as pump- 
kin pie ; or bake, or boil and slice, same as for sour apple pie. 

442. Custard Pie. 

Articles. — Corn starch, one tablespoonful ; sugar, two ; 
one egg ; milk, a quart. 

Directions. — Boil the milk in the double boiler, add the 
starch and sugar ; when it is all boiled five minutes let it cool, 
then add the egg well beaten, nutmeg, and a little butter; line 
some plates with pie crust, pour in the custard and bake. 

443. Cherry Pie. 

Choose fair jripe cherries, the large black English being the 
best for this purpose ; wash and look them over carefully ; fill 
the pie plate evenly full ; strew sugar over the top ; dredge in 
plenty of flour ; cover with a moderately thick upper crust, and 
bake one hour. 

444. Raspberry Pie. 

Take nice ripe berries, (either red or black are about equally 
good); wash and pick them carefully ; place them an inch or 
more thick on the under crust ; strew a small quantity of sugar, 
and a trifle of flour over them ; put on the upper crust and 
bake half an hour. 

445. Blackberry Pie. 

This is made in the same manner as the preceding. All 
berries for pies should be ripe or nearly so, and as fresh as 
possible. 

446. Whortleberry Pie. 

Whortleberries make excellent pies, and are in market 



PIES. 131 

usually longer than any of the summer fruits. It is made in 
the same manner as raspberry. 

447. Cranberry Pie. 

Wash the berries in a pan of water, rejecting all the bad ones ; 
simmer them until they become soft and burst open ; strain 
through a fine wire sieve, removing all the hulls ;• add sugar to 
taste ; bake on a thick under crust in a moderate oven. 

448. Peach Pie. 

Select rich juicy peaches, of a rather small and nearly uniform 
size. They should be very ripe ; peel and slice them, fill the 
pie dish with them, sprinkle sugar and a little flour over them ; 
add a tablespoonful of water, cover and bake one hour. 

449. Plum Pie 

Is made in the same manner as the peach pie. It requires much 
more sugar to make it at all palatable. 

450. Currant Pie. 

Currants are made into pies by stewing them and sweetening 
according to the degree of acidity, and baking between two 
crusts in the ordinary manner. Or better still, merely fill the 
pie with them without any previous cooking, sprinkle sugar 
over, dredge in a little flour, and bake the same as apple pie. 

451. Gooseberry Pie. 

This is made in precisely the same manner as currant pie ; 
it is very palatable. 

452. Minced Meats for Pies. 

One pound of currants, four pounds of peeled and chopped 
apples, one pound of suet chopped fine, one beef's heart boiled 
tender and chopped fine ; pull the strings from the suet and 
add one pound of raisins stoned and cut in two ; the juice of 
four oranges and two lemons, with the chopped peel of one , 
add of ground mace and allspice each a spoonful, and a turn- 



I 3 2 



PIES- 



blerful of brandy. Mix all well together, and boil the liquor 
down, and when done cover the mince meat over with the 
liquor and keep it closely Covered in a cool place, until wanted 
for use. When you want to use the mince meat add cider to 
your taste. 

453. Imitation of Mince Pie. 
An excellent imitation of mince pie may be made by placing 
between the layers of raisins, currants and chopped apples ; 
season precisely as for a mince pie. 

INDIAN MEAL, MUSH, BREAD, BISCUIT, 
CAKES, PUDDINGS, ETC. 

Indian meal is Indian corn ground coarse. In many parts of 
our country it is eaten in every variety of form, not only on 
account of its cheapness, but of its health and strength-giving 
qualities ; it agrees with almost every one. Perhaps less ot this 
is used in cities than in the country ; yet it is not because the 
city folks do not like it. No, it is because their wives and 
cooks do not know how to cook meal. 

The estimate of the cost to support a man on Indian meal 
is about ten dollars a year. Of course, no one would live on 
cornmeal alone ; but where is the food that will compare with 
it ? No> one, not one. If families would or have to economize, 
they should bear in mind that a pound of meal swells to more 
than double in cooking; that it is nearly all nutriment; that 
it takes four pounds of meat or potatoes to equal one pound of 
meal ; in reality, one pound of flour does not go as far as a 
pound of meal. 

We give* more recipes for cooking Indian meal, and in greater 
variety than ever were given before by any and all the cook 
books combined ; try them. 

And recollect that every pound o meal used where flour 
would have been, sivcs you a le:.st four cents, and any of the 
very palatable dishes are cheaper than any others. Many 



INDIAN MEAL. 



*33 



families use fried mush in place of potatoes ; of children, 
ninety-nine in a hundred prefer it. 

In all cases buy yellow meal ; it is sweeter and stronger than 
the white. It comes to the market sifted ; but in using our 
recipes always sift it again. Buy meal made from old corn ; it 
costs more, but keeps longer. Keep meal in a cool, dry place, 
uncovered.

FLOUR, BREAD, Etc. 

Wheat, Rye, Barley, Corn, and Oat Flour. 

Flour is made from all the above grains, especially from 
wheat and rye, for general use ; one contains about as much 
nutriment as the other, but general use and taste have selected 
wheat flour, although foreigners use much rye flour. Well 
made of good rye, it can hardly be told from wheat. The 
writer has made a dinner from rye bread and clreese, on many 
occasions, and at one time a party of which he was one, called 
at a house in the country. The German woman said all she 
had was some bread and cheese. Not one of the party knew 
what kind of bread they were eating until the writer told them. 
She said it cost her five dollars and a half a barrel ; good wheat 
flour was worth nine dollars and fifty cents at the time. I mention 
this fact to show that a poor German wife could make as good 
bread from rye as wheat flour, saving four dollars a barrel. 
Flours are ground too fine ; the whiter and finer the flour the 
more starch, and the less nutriment and health-giving proper- 
ties there are in it, anjd the more costly it is. 

Most people are unaware how unhealthy fine flour is. In 
experiments made on healthy dogs with fine flour bread alone, 
with water, two years ago, it killed them all within forty days ; 
most of them died within thirty days. On graham flour bread, 
which is wheat ground coarse, with the hulls or chaff in, they 
grew fat and healthy, and did not die. When fed on corn 
meal bread they were healthy and fat. and we assert that any 
one who should eat fine flour bread of any kind alone, without 
medicine, would not live sixty days. The reason of it is that 
its starchy nature is like a paste, clogs up the stomach and 
intestines ; the liver refuses to act ; the result is sickness and 



YEAST BREAD. I 45 

Let all enjoy nature and art, but not to excess. In many 
things fine flour is excellent — for cakes, pastry, and once a day 
for bread, biscuit or rolls. 

In making bread by our recipes, we give a variety of 
methods for making flour bread and biscuit. Wheat, rye, corn, 
graham and barley flours can be used in any quantity to suit 
the palate, or a little meal of either of the above can be put in. 
A pound of fine wheat flour costs as much as two pounds of 
rye or graham flour, or three of cornmeal, giving no more 
nutriment. Try a variety, for it is the spice of life. You will 
not regret it. You will thereby save health and acquire 

WEALTH. 

YEAST BREAD, Etc, j 

500. How to make Excellent Yeast Bread, Rolls, 
Biscuit, Twists, Etc. 

Yeast is made from hops, flour, potatoes, etc. We give 
three of the best ways to make it. Yeast acts by fermentation, 
which produces gases in the dough, and is held by it, in con- 
sequence making the dough light ; heat causes the fermenta- 
tion, cold prevents it. As the heat of the oven holds the 
dough just as the gases make it, — the more kneading the better, 
as it makes it fine. It is necessary, in order to make good bread, 
to understand the' reasons fully why yeast makes the bread rise; 
therefore, to make nice bread, etc., follow these rules : 

1. Flour should be kept in a dry closet — if at all damp 
it will make the bread heavy. When about to make bread put 
the quantity of flour you are to use in a pan near the fire, in 
order to have it w T arm and dry for use. Seven pounds of flour 
or meal make a good batch ©f bread. 

2. Yeast. — Use fresh liquid yeast, or if your own, keep it 
well corked in a bottle ; or use the yeast cakes now for sale in 
the stores. The better the yeast the less you require. Too 
much yeast makes the bread taste of yeast and has a bad effect 



14^ FLOUR, BREAD, ETC 



on the bread ; it dries quick and is not so sweet as if risen 
slowly. Too little yeast will make it heavy. Seven pounds of 
flour or meal require a gill of yeast. 

3. Salt. — Sift it with the flour. To seven pounds of flour 
or meal, add a large tablespoonful. 

4. Fat.- — Three tablespoonfuls of any fat kneaded into the 
dough after it has risen the first time, makes it flaky, rich and 
short. 

5- Cleanliness is all important; have the pans, hands and 
arms clean. 

6. Dough. — Never have it half made, nor allow it to get cold 
before it is finished ; if you do, it will be heavy. After making 
it, cover the pan with a thick cloth. 

7. Kneading. — Fold the fingers over the thumbs, beat and 
pommel the dough until it ceases to stick to your hands* Do 
this on making, and after it har> risen. Much kneading makes 
it whiter and finer. Bread can scarcely be kneaded too much ; 
the reason is plain — the fermented yeast forms very small 
globules, making a dense yet light bread. 

8. Souring. — If the dough sours, dissolve a teaspoonful 
of soda in as much hot water ; work it into the dough — some 
prefer it after this is in ; it gives a different taste to it, and 
the bread is whiter and more tender* 

9. Heat. — Dough should be made in cold weather in a 
warm room and kept there. If it is too slow in rising, set it 
over a pan of hot water and keep it warm. 

10. Consistency. — If too thin, add more flour; it should 
■not run or spread ; if too thick, let it rise a little longer, or 
add a little warm water. 

11. To keep Dough Good. — Keep in winter in the cellar, 
or any cool place ; in summer, in the refrigerator. Thus you 
can have bread or biscuit at any time. If it sours, use soda. 



YEAST BREAD. 



M7 



12. Baking. — Bake in a moderately hot oven for bread; 
biscuit should have a hotter oven. 

13. To know when Bread is Baked. — When bread is 
brown and firm to the touch all over, it is done. We give the 
time of baking as near as possible, but the heat of the ovens 
varies very much ; therefore care must be taken not to overdo 
or underdo the bread or biscuit. 

501. How to make Yeast Cakes. 

Put a large handful of hops into two quarts of boiling water. 
Boil three large potatoes until they are tender. Mash them 
and add to them two pounds of flour ; pour the boiling hop 
water over the flour through a sieve or colander, and beat it 
until it is quite smooth. While it is warm add two table- 
spoonfuls of salt, and half a teacupful of sugar. Before it is 
quite cold stir in a pint of good yeast. After the yeast has be- 
come quite light, stir in as much Indian meal as it will take to 
roll it out in cakes, and place them on a cloth in a dry place, 
taking care to turn them every day. At the end of a week, or 
ten days, they may be put into a bag, and should be kept in a 
dry place. When used, take one of these cakes, soak it in 
some milk- warm water, mash it up smooth, and use it as you 
would any other kind of yeast. 

502. To make Baker's Yeast. [Time.— Two hours.] 
Articles. — Three tablespoonfuls of flour, two quarts of 
water, a quarter of a pound of brown sugar, a quarter of a 
pound of yeast. 

Directions. — Make three spoonfuls of flour into a smooth 
batter with a little cold water; then add to it nearly two quarts 
more water, and a quarter of a pound of brown sugar ; put it 
over the fire ; stir it occasionally, and then set it to cool ; when 
it is only lukewarm, add two tablespoonfuls of good veast • 
set it in a warm place, or near the fire, for a day to ferment'- 
then pour off the thin liquor from the top, shake up the remainder 



143 YEAST- 



and put it in a bottle for use, or keep it in a covered stone jar. 
A gill of this yeast will be sufficient for seven pounds of flour. 

503. Potato Yeast. 

Boil a quarter of a peck of potatoes, mash them fine, and 
thin them a little with the water in which they have been 
boiled ; add some salt and a tablespoonful of brown sugar ; 
when lukewarm, stir in about half a pint or more of old yeast, 
let it rise, then cover it closely and put it in a cool place, — it 
is fit for use then. 

504. Hop Yeast. 

Tie a. large handful of hops in a thin bag and boil them in 
three quarts of water ; moisten with cold water a sufficient 
quantity of flour, and stir in the hop yeast while boiling hot ; 
add a handful of salt ; let it stand until it is about lukewarm, 
and then add about a pint of old yeast ; when it is light, cover 
it and stand it in a cool place, for use. 

505. How to make Nice and Good Cream of Tartar 
and Soda Bread. 

It is very important to have light, sweet bread. It is not 
always convenient to have yeast bread, and a change is agreea- 
ble. To have the above chemicals pure and uniform is all- 
important ; they will keep in tin cans any length of time, 
therefore we recommend that cream of tartar, saleratus, or 
soda, be bought of firs^-class dealers, and buy the best. 

Cream of tartar is made from the settlings of wine ; saleratus 
and soda are made from potash. 

THE WAY THEY WORK. 

Cream of tartar is an acid ; soda and saleratus are anti- acids. 

When the dissolved soda is worked into the dough, it meets 
the acid, and they form into gases, which, trying to escape, 
cause the dough to rise into little minute bubbles ; the heat of 
the oven causes them still more to ferment, and then "baking 



CREAM OF TARTAR AND SODA. 1 49 

the dough forms a crust which confines the gases, and that 
causes the bread or biscuit to be light. 

1. Cream of Tartar. — Two heaping teaspoonfuls to two 
quarts of flour or meal ; sift it with the flour or meal. Too 
much tartar makes the bread sour, and is unhealthy. 

2. Saleratus. — An even teaspoonful, or soda a teaspoonful, 
to two quarts of flour or meal; dissolve first in half a teacupful 
of water ; when dissolved, put it into the water or milk ; that 
is to be used as soda ; unless prepared in this way it is apt to dis- 
color the bread. Too much soda makes the bread yellow and 
unhealthy. 

3. Salt. — A heaping teaspoonful to two quarts of flour or 
meal ; sift it with the flour or meal, and cream of tartar. 

4. Fat. — ^A tablespoonful of any kind of fat to two quarts 
of flour or meal ; after it is sifted, work it into the dry flour or 
meal, that is if shortening is desired. 

5. Milk or Water. — A pint; milk is much the best, and 
adds all it costs to the goodness of the bread. 

6. Sour or Butter Milk. — A pint. If you have or can 
get either, it is best, as it saves the cream of tartar, the acid of 
the milk doing as well ; use the soda, however, but no tartar. 

7. Dough.- — The dough must be as thin in consistency as 
possible, so as to pat it out on a board half an inch thick, 
and cut it with a round cake-cutter. 

8. The Oven. — Always have that ready and hot, for this 
bread must be baked as soon as made, in a quick oven. 

9. Health. — Hot bread is not as healthy as cold bread, 
still a little will kill no one, As these biscuits are very good 
warm, the healthy can eat them. The dyspeptic and invalid 
had better not eat them. 

506. Yeast (or Baking) Powder, 
(not yeast cakes, nor hop cakes), is made of one-third soda, 



I50 BREAD ETC. 



or one-quarter improved saleratus, or two-thirds of cream of 
tartar, well mixed. I prefer to use the soda and tartar sepa^ 
rate]y. 

507. To make Good Corn Meal Yeast Bread or 

Biscuit. 
The above rules apply to cornmeal, or graham flour, or rye 
meal, or brown bread, biscuit, etc., except : 

1. They must be made thinner in a thick batter, and all 
the work can be done with a strong spoon ; no lard is needed -, 
they are not so much trouble to make. 

2. They generally require molasses to sweeten them. 

3. They require longer baking. 

4. Cornmeal soda-biscuit and bread do not require so hot 
an oven as flour. 

5. Except these five things, the yeast and soda. rules apply 
to the corn-meal recipes for bread, biscuit, etc. 

508. Rye or Wheat Flour Yeast Bread. [Time.— One 

HOUR TO BAKE LOAVES OF TWO POUNDS WEIGHT EACH.] 

Articles. — Seven pounds of flour; two quarts of warm 
water ; a large tablespoonful of salt ; half a pint of yeast, and 
two large tablespoonfuls of fat. 

Directions. — -Put the flour into a deep pan, heap it round 
the sides, leaving a hollow in the center, put into it a quart of 
warm water, the salt and yeast ; have ready three pints more of 
warm water, and with as much of it as may be necessary, make 
the whole into a rather soft dough, kneading it well with both 
hands. When it is smooth and shining,. strew a little flour on 
it, lay a thickly folded cloth over the pan, and set it in a warm 
place by the fire, for four or five hours in cold weather, or all 
night ; then knead it again for a quarter of an hour, at the 
same time kneading in the fat ; Cover it over, and set it to rise 
again. Divide it into two or three loaves, and bake it in a, 



GRAHAM FLOUR. 1 5 I 



quick oven. It will take one hour to bake it, if divided into 
loaves weighing two pounds each ; and two hours, if the loaves 
weigh four pounds each. This bread can be made of rye, or 
wheat, or graham flour, or any kind that may suit. Cornmeal 
can be added. 

509. Graham Flour Bread. [Time. — Bake a little 

LONGER THAN YEAST BREAD.] 

Made same as yeast bread, adding a cup of molasses, and 
baking longer. This bread is made from graham flour. If you 
wish it coarse, do not sift it ; if, on using it, it is found to be 
too coarse or opening for the bowels, the bran can be sifted 
out. More molasses can be added, or none, as preferred. It 
is better for costive persons than any medicine. 

510. Graham and Flour Bread. 

Made same as yeast bread, sifting the graham flour, and add- 
ing one-half wheat flour. Add a cup of molasses. 

511. Potato Bread. [Time. — To bake, one and a half 

TO TWO HOURS.] 

Articles. — Two and a half pounds of mealy potatoes ; 
seven pounds of flour ; a gill of yeast, and two ounces of salt. 

Directions. — Boil two pounds and a half of nice mealy 
potatoes, till floury ; rub and mash them smooth ; then mix 
them with sufficient cold water to let them pass through a 
coarse sieve, and any lumps that remain must be again mashed 
and pressed through. Mix this paste with the yeast, and then 
add it to the flour. Set it to rise, knead it well, and make it 
into a stiff, tough dough and bake. 

512. Rice Bread. [Time. — One and a half to two hours.] 
Articles. — Half a pound of rice ; three pints of water, and 

six pounds of flour. 

Directions. — Boil half a pound of rice in three pints of 
water, till the whole is quite thick ; with this, and yeast, and 
six pounds of flour, make the dough. 



152 BREAD, ETC 



513. Bread without Yeast or Soda. [Time. — Five 

HOURS TO RISE.] 

Articles. — Milk or water, a quart ; salt ; flour, and two 
tablespoonfuls of lard. 

Directions. — Make the milk or water lukewarm ; stir in the 
salt, as much as will do for the bread ; stir in flour to make a 
paste ; do this in a kettle ; set it in a pot of warm water ; keep 
the water or milk warm. In five hours it will foam like yeast ; 
then knead in flour and lard, put into pans, let them rise again, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

514. French Rolls. [Time. — Half an hour.] 
Articles — One pound of flour ; one egg ; one ounce of 
butter , one spoonful of yeast ; a little salt, and some milk. 

Directions. — Beat well the butter into the flour, adding a 
little salt ; beat an egg, and stir it into the flour with the yeast, 
and a sufficient quantity of milk, to make the dough rather 
stiff. Beat it well without kneading it ; set it to rise, and bake 
it on tins. This quantity will make about six rolls. 

515. Irish Rolls. [Time. — Fifteen to twenty minutes.] 

Articles. — Two pounds of fine flour ; one teaspoonful of 

fine salt ; one dessertspoonful of powdered sugar; half a tea- 
spoonful of best carbonate of soda ; whites of eggs, and some 
sour buttermilk. 

Directions. — Mix with the flour, the salt, sugar, and car- 
bonate of soda. Then beat the whites of two eggs into a strong 
froth, with a sufficient quantity of sour buttermilk, and mix 
them up the same as rolls made with yeast. Make them up at 
once into whatever shape you like. Wash them over with the 
white of an egg, and bake them in a rather quick oven, of a 
light brown, for about a quarter of an hour, or according to 
the size of your rolls. They are very light and white. The 
sourer the buttermilk, the lighter the rolls will be. A basin of 
buttermilk will keep for a week, or very sour milk will answer 
as well. 



ENGLISH ROLLS. 



!53 



516. English Rolls. [Time. — Twen*ty minutes to bake.] 
Articles. — Two pounds of flour ; two ounces of butter ; 

three spoonfuls of good yeast, and one pint of warm milk. 

Directions. — Take the flour and rub the butter into it ; add 
the yeast strained, and mix all well together with a pint of 
warm milk. Set it before the fire to rise, make it into twelve 
rolls, and bake them in a moderate oven. 

517. Baker's Rolls. [Time. — Twenty minutes to bake.] 
Articles. — Three pounds of flour ; two tablespoonfuls of 

yeast ; one teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of soda. 
Directions. — Put the flour into a pan, make a hollow in the 
center, and put in the salt, soda, and yeast. Make it into a 
soft dough with some warm milk ; work or knead it until it is 
smooth and shining, then cover it and set it in a warm place, 
for two hours. Work it again very smooth, let it rise, and 
again knead and divide it in pieces twice the size of a hen's 
egg ; roll it between your hands to the length of your finger ; 
lay them so as to touch each other, on baking tins, brush them 
over with milk, and set them in a quick oven, for fifteen or 
twenty minutes, until they are a delicate brown. Break one 
open to see if it is done, and serve them hot for breakfast, 
broken open, as cutting them when hot soddens them. To 
make a roll egg-shaped in form do not quite half lap it over, 
or cut round and lap over one-third. 

518. Baker's Twists. [Time. — Nearly one hour.] 
Directions. — Let the bread be made as directed for baker's 
rolls ; then take three pieces as large as a half-pint bowl ; strew 
a little flour over the paste-board ; roll each piece under your 
hands to twelve inches in length, making it smaller in circum- 
ference at the ends than in the middle. Having rolled each 
piece in this way, take a baking tin, lay one part on it, join 
one end of each to the other two, and braid them together the 
length of the roll. Join the ends by pressing them together ', 



3 54 BREAD, ETC. 



dip a brush in milk, and pass it over the top of your twists. 
After ten minutes, set them in a quick oven, and bake them for 
nearly an hour. They can be made smaller if desired. 

519. Velvet Biscuit. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 

Articles. — One pint of warm milk ; two eggs ; half a gill 
of yeast ; a teaspoonful of soft butter ; a teaspoon ful of salt, 
and sufficient flour to make a soft dough. 

Directions. — In the milk and two well- beaten eggs put the 
yeast, soft butter, and salt. Stir into it sufficient flour to make 
a soft dough ; strew some flour over it ; lay a warm towel over 
the pan, and set it in a warm place to rise (three hours in the 
summer, or until light in the winter). Dip your hands in flour, 
and work the dough down 3 make it into small flat cakes ; lay 
them on a buttered tin pan, quite near each other, and bake 
them in a quick oven for fifteen minutes, or until done. 

These cakes may be mixed at night, and baked for breakfast. 
Keep the dough cool for supper, if required. 

520. Sponge Flour Biscuit. [Time. — About ten minutes.] 
Articles. — Flour, a quart, sweet milk, a pint; lard, a 

tablespoonful ; salt, a teaspoonful, and a teacupful of yeast. 

Directions. — Sift the flour and salt into a pan ; heat the 
milk and lard together ; pour the yeast and milk into the flour . 
make a stiff dough when risen ; grease a pan and drop the batter 
on in large tablespoonfuls ; let them set where they will be 
merely warm (no more), then bake in a quick oven, and eat at 
once. They may be baked in cups. 

521. Rye and Flour Tea Biscuit. [Time. — To make 

and bake, half an hour.] 

Articles.— Rye flour, one tumblerful ; wheat flour, two tum- 
blers or large cupfuls ; cream of tartar, a teaspoonful ;' soda, half

Articles. — A piece of risen bread dough the size of a small 
loaf; one egg ; one tablespoonful of butter or lard, and a little 
milk. 

Directions. — Take a piece of risen bread dough, and work 
into it one beaten egg and a tablespoonful of butter or lard ; 
when it is thoroughly amalgamated, flour your hands and make 
it into balls the size of an egg ; rub a tin over with milk, and 
set them in a quick oven for twenty minutes, and serve them 
hot for breakfast. When eaten, break them open ; to cut would 
make them heavy. 

523. Milk Biscuit. [Time.— Half an hour.] 

Articles. — Six handfuls of flour; half a pint of milk; a 
small piece of butter ; half a teacupful of yeast, and one egg. 

Directions. — Put the flour in a basin, with half a pint of

solved soda ; lastly, drop the batter in balls on a greased pan 
or small pans, and bake in a quick oven. 

527. Graham Flour Mush. 

This is an excellent article for infants and young children. 

It will do for a change for adults, but it is not equal to the 

coarser preparation of the grain. It is cooked like Indian 

mush. 

528. Unleavened Bread. 

This bread is made by the water-cure, and hygienic believers 
who are opposed to the use of yeast, soda, saleratus, salt and 
cream of tartar. Persons with very weak stomachs will derive 
benefit from the use of this bread. As a change any one can. 
use it, if they desire to. This bread requires a hot oven. 



GRAHAM GEMS. 157 



529. Graham Gems. 

Into cold water stir graham flour sufficient to make a batter 
a trifle thicker than that used for ordinary griddle cakes. Bake 
from one-half to three-quarters of an hour in a hot oven, in 
small tins or a tin pan. The flour should be stirred in slowly. 
Use soft water or part milk. 

530. Graham Diamonds. 

Pour boiling water on graham flour, stirring rapidly till all 
the flour is wet. Too much stirring makes it tough. It should 
be about as thick as can be stirred easily with a strong iron 
spoon. Place the dough with plenty of flour upon the moulding 
board, and knead it for two or three minutes. Roll out half 
an inch thick, and cut in small cakes or rolls. If a large 
quantity is required, roll about three-fourths of an inch thick, 
and cut with a knife in diamond shape. Bake, in a very hot 
oven, forty-five minutes. 

531. Graham Biscuit. 

Make graham mush as for the table ; when cool, mix with it 
graham flour sufficient to roll well. Knead for a few minutes, 
roll three-fourths of an inch thick, cut with a common biscuit 
cutter, and bake in a hot oven, from thirty to forty- five 
minutes. 

532. Wheat Meal Crisps. 

Make a very stiff dough of graham flour and cold water ; 
knead thoroughly, roll as thin as possible, and bake for twenty 
minutes in a hot oven. 

533. Oat Meal Mush. 

This, in Scotland, is called stirabout. It is a favorite with 
many persons, and makes a pleasant change of dishes. It is 
cooked precisely like Indian meal mush. 

534. Uses for Stale Bread. 

Stale bread may be cut into slices and softened by pouring a 
small quantity of boiling water over them. Cover the pan con- 



158 OYSTERS. 



taining the bread, to prevent the escape of the steam. As soon as 
it is soft, season the slices with pepper and salt, have some 
hot lard, ham fat, or sausages, dripped in a pan, dust a little 
flour or Indian meal on each slice, and fry them a delicate 
brown. Boiling milk, if you have it, is better than water to 
soften the bread. 

OYSTERS. 

As a healthy, nutritious, and cheap article of food we recom- 
mend oysters ; many dishes can be made from them. In cases 
of debility, raw oysters and the soup made from them are very 
strengthening. 

The American oysters are unquestionably the best that can 
be found. They vary in taste according to how they are 
treated, either after being dredged or while imbedded, and 
also according to the nature of the soil and water in which 
they have lived. It is very wrong to wash oysters ; we mean 
by washing oysters, the abominable habit of throwing them in 
cold water as soon as opened, then to be sold by the measure. 
It is more than a pity to thus spoil such an excellent and deli- 
cate article of food. 

Oysters, like lobsters, are not good when dead. To ascertain 
if they are alive, as soon as opened, and when one of the shells 
is removed, touch gently the edge of the oyster, and if alive it 
will contract. 

535. To Feed Oysters. 

Wash them perfectly clean with water, then lay them bottom 

downwards in a deep pan, and pour over them salt water ; the 
salt should be previously dissolved in the water, allowing about 
five or six ounces to each gallon of water. Change the water 
every day. You may fatten them by putting oatmeal into the 
water every day. 

536. To Keep Oysters Alive and Good. 

Put them in a clean pan, cover them with pure, water

TO OPEN OYSTERS. 159 



moderately- salted, and changed every day. Keep them in a 
cool place. 

537. To Open Oysters. 

In opening them, try and avoid cutting them by keeping 
the point of the knife close to the shell. In New York they 
crack the point of the oyster to open them, but they can be 
opened without that, and it avoids the fine pieces of shell 
getting into the meat of the oyster. 

538. Raw Oysters. 

When well -washed open them, detaching the upper shell, 
then detach them from the under shell, but leave them on it ; 
place on a dish and serve. 

To eat them, sprinkle with salt, pepper, and lemon juice. 
They are excellent eaten with thin slices of brown bread and 
butter.

LOBSTERS. 

Lobsters are very fine sheli-fish, and are caught in abundance 
along the shores of the New England States and Canada. The 



TO CHOOSE LOBSTERS. 1 69 



male lobster is distinguished by the narrowness of his tail ; 
the female has a broader tail and small claws. All of the 
lobster is good to eat, except the stomach and a small intestine 
which runs through it. The flavor of the lobster is generally 
considered to be superior, in both purity and delicacy, to 
that of the other crustacece. They are a very agreeable and 
nutritive article of food, but are not suitable for dyspeptics 
or invalids. The usual way of cooking them has been to simply 
boil and eat them cold, with vinegar, or as a salad, but there 
are many other ways to cook these very economical fish, as 
will be seen by the following recipes. 

569. To Choose Lobsters. 

The heaviest are the best, and very often a good small-sized 
lobster will weigh heavier than a large one. The male is the 
best for boiling, the flesh is firmer, the shell of a brighter red. 
Hen lobsters are best for sauces or salads, on account of their 
coral. They are generally sent to market boiled ; if you bu,v 
them alive, then proceed 

570. To Boil a Lobster. [Time. — An hour.] 
Put into a large kettle water enough to cover the lobster, 
with a quarter of a pound of salt to every gallon of water. 

When it boils fast, put in the lobster, head first. If the head 
goes in first, it is killed instantly. Boil it briskly for an hour 
then take it from the hot water, and lay it to drain. Wipe off 
all the scum from it. A lobster weighing a pound takes one 
hour to boil, others in like proportion, more or less. It will 
be a bright red, when done. 

571. Plain Boiled Lobster. 

After it is boiled and cold, break off the tail, cut it in two 
pieces with a sharp knife • remove the small intestine and remove 
the meat ; break the claws up and remove their meat ; then break 
off the small legs ; open the body ; take out everything but the

stomach ; cut the inner body open ; arrange it all round a 
dish, and serve for breakfast, dinner, or supper. Use vinegar 
and pepper. 

572. To Dress Lobsters. 
When sent to the table, separate the body from the tail,, 
remove the large claws, and crack them at each joint carefully, 
and split the tail down the middle with a sharp knife. Place 
the body upright in the center of a dish, and arrange the tail 
and claws on each side. Garnish it with parsley. 

573. Lobster Salad. [Time. — Twenty minutes. 1 

Articles. — A lobster ; yolks of two eggs ; a spoonful of 
made mustard ; three tablespoonfuls of salad oil ; vinegar , a 
little salt, and some fresh lettuce. 

Directions. — Pick all the meat out of the lobster ; thoroughly 
beat the yolks of two eggs , beat in made mustard to taste, 
and, continuing to beat them, drop in the sweet oil ; add 
whatever flavoring may be preferred, and some salt ; mix in 
the vinegar to taste, and the soft part of the lobster ; moisten 
the remainder of the lobster with this, and lay it at the bottom 
of the bowl ; cut up the lettuce ; take care that it is well rolled 
over in the dressing, and put it over the lobster. Mustard can 
be left out if it is not liked. The above quantity is given for 
the proportions and can be increased according to the lobster 
employed, or taste. 

574. Scalloped Lobster. [Time. — Fifteen minutes.] 

Articles. — One or two lobsters ; a little pepper, salt, cay- 
enne, and a tablespoonful of butter, 01* thin melted butter, and 
bread crumbs. 

Directions. — Pick out all the meat from one large or two 
middling-sized lobsters, and cut fine in a chopping tray, with 
a little pepper, salt, cayenne, and melted butter sufficient to 
moisten it. Split the empty shells of the tails and the bodies, 






SCALLOPED. 171 

and fill each of them neatly with the lobster. Cover them with 
grated bread, and put them into an oven. 

575. English Way to Scallop Lobsters. [Time.— 
Twenty minutes.] 

Articles. — One large lobster ; a teaspoonful of anchovy 
sauce ; three tablespoonfuls of white sauce or cream ; yolks of

at once. In frying potatoes or small articles they can be 
tossed in it, instead of being turned with a fork ; try your fat

PRESERVES. 



195 



PRESERVES. 

Jams, Jellies, Marmalade. 

For making preserves, a good sound fruit and good white 
(granulated is really the cheapest) sugar should be used. 

651. The Fruit 

should be sound, ripe, and good ; any rind can be preserved, 
as well as many kinds of vegetables. 

652. The Sugar. 

We use for all purposes white granulated sugar ; it is the 
most economical in the end, dry and handy. 

653. The Preserving Kettles. 

Most persons use a copper or brass kettle, but we prefer, for 
large lots, a porcelain one ; for a quart or two use the double 
boiler. Never keep preserves in the kettle any longer than to 
cook them, as the metal will injure them. 

654. The Proportion of Fruit and Sugar. 

A pound of fruit to a pound of sugar is generally used ; a 
tumblerful of water to a pound of sugar to make the syrup. 
Always skim off all the froth or scum. 

655. To Keep Preserves Good. 

Put them in stone jars or vessels of glass, earthen or stoneware ; 
cover tightly and keep in a cool, dry place. Look at them 
every month ; if they are turning, scald and return to the jars. 

656. Damson Cheese. [Time. — One hour and a half 

to boil.] 

Articles. — To every quart of plums allow a quarter of a 
pound of sugar, and to every pound of pulp add half a pound 
of sugar. 

Directions. — Gather the plums when full ripe, put them 
into a jar, and to every quart of plums add the sugar. Bake 
them in a moderate oven until they are soft ; then rub them 



I96 PRESERVES. 



through a hair sieve. To every pound of pulp add half a 
pound of sugar beaten fine ; boil it over a slow fire in a 
double boiler, and stir it all the time ; pour it into shapes, tie 
brandy paper over them, and keep them in a dry place. They 
will not be fit to use for three or four months. All cheese may 
be made by this recipe except greengage, which does not 
require so much sugar. 

657. Green Gooseberry Jam. [Time— Forty-five 

MINUTES.] 

Articles. — Three pounds of gooseberries and two pounds 
and a half of sugar. 

Directions. — Pick off the stalks and buds from the goose, 
berries ; bruise them lightly ; put them into a preserving pan 
and boil them quickly for eight or ten minutes, stirring all the 
time ; add the sugar to the fruit, and boil it quickly for three- 
quarters of an hour, carefully removing the scum as it rises. 
When done, put it into pots, cover it with brandy paper, and 
secure it closely down with paper moistened with the white of 
an egg. 

658. Green Gooseberry Jelly— an Excellent Substi- 
tute for Guava Jelly. [Time.— One hour and 

TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES TO BOIL.]

and one pound of sugar to each pound of fruit. 

Directions. — Wash some green gooseberries very clean' 
after having taken off the tops and stalks ; then to each pound 
of fruit pour three-quarters of a pint of water, and simmer 
them until they are well broken ; turn the whole into a jelly- 
bag or cloth, and let the juice drain through ; weigh the juice 
and boil it rapidly for fifteen minutes ; draw it from the fire 
and stir into it, until entirely dissolved, an equal weight of 
sugar ; then boil the jelly from fifteen to twenty minutes 
longer, or until it jellies strongly on the spoon. It must be

of sugar. 

Directions. — Procure some fine scarlet strawberries, strip 
off the stalks and put them into a preserving pan over a 
moderate fire ; boil them for half an hour, keeping them con- 
stantly stirred. Mix the sugar with the berries after they have 
been removed from the fire ; then place it again over the fire,

PICKLING VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 

We do not consider pickles healthy for the well, and they 
are positively injurious 1o the weak and sick. Immense quan- 
tities are put up every year, sold and eaten, and they are con- 
sidered a necessity of civilization. As many families desire to 
put them up, we give a number of good recipes. 

668. The Vinegar. 

Procure always the best apple, or white wine vinegar. The 
success of good pickling depends upon using good vinegar. 
Always boil the vinegar unless stated otherwise. 

669. The Vegetables and Fruit 

should be sound and good. 

670. Cooking Utensils to use in Pickling. 

Use saucepans or kettles lined with porcelain. If copper or 
tin is used to boil vinegar in, do not let it remain in them a 
moment longer than is necessary to boil them. Use wooden 
knives and forks. 

671. The Bottles, Jars, or Vessels. 

Use glass bottles for pickles. If jars are used they must be 
unglazed, as the glaze, acted upon by the vinegar, produces a 
strong poison. Wooden vessels for large quantities are best. 
Fill either of them three-quarters full of pickles, then fill with 
vinegar.

JELLY ICE CREAMS. 

The old way of making ice cream is with cream or milk, 
sugar, essence, and a large number of eggs. This plan made a 
fair, but expensive ice cream. If milk was used the result was a 
coarse ice cream, full of lumps of ice. What is required is a 
smooth rich cream, at a small expense ; in order to do this we 
had to reduce the water *to a jelly with the aid of new and cheap 
foods, so that the icy granules would not be formed. By our 
recipes this has been accomplished, and the cheapest, richest, 
smoothest, finest, most nutritious and healthy ice creams ever 
made, are now given to the public. 

691. Jelly Ice Creams. 

Are made by reducing gelatinous animal and vegetable 
preparations to a jelly, and adding sugar, eggs, and flavoring 
to taste. They are superior to any other. 

692. Light Jelly Ice Creams. 

Those wishing to have them light should eat them as soon 
as made. 

693. To Improve Creams. 

After they are made draw off the water from the wooden 
freezer, pack it full of broken ice and salt, take out the dasher 
if you have one in the tin part, scrape off the cream that 
adheres to the sides, cover it over with the cover, then pack 
any old blankets, or any other cloth covers, around the whole 
freezer, let it stand for two or three hours or longer, and it 
will be hard, rich, and smooth. Packed with salt and ice it 
will keep hard as long as desired. 

We prefer condensed milk to make these creams, although 



208 JELLY ICE CREAMS. 



common milk will do. We give the recipes for common milk. 
If condensed is used, use one part milk and three parts water.

RICH ICE CREAMS. 

The old method of freezing involved hours of really hard 
work of whirling by hand the common freezer, With the 
modern inventions, it is but a few minutes' easy labor, which 
a child can perform. 

To those who are compelled to remain in the city during 
the summer, its use is almost a necessity ; even during the 
colder months it is a delicacy that is pleasant. These recipes 
are rich and delicious in flavor, and, of course, cost more than 
the common or jelly creams. 

In freezing ice cream, the substance to be frozen should 
always be cold before putting it in the freezer, as it saves ice. 

Use any common salt — not rock salt, as rock salt settles to 
the bottom of the tub. 

Break the ice fine ; a good way is to put it in a coarse sack, 
and break it with a mallet or round billet of wood.

APPLES. 

Apples are our national fruit — generally the cheapest of all 
fruits. Some kinds can be kept until the new crop grows. 
Dried, they are the cheapest of dried fruits, if not the best. 
It is important that all should know how to use this wholesome, 
hearty, and excellent fruit. They can be used in many ways ; 
and where the whole fruit cannot be had, use the dried. 

Healthfulness of Apples. — There is scarcely an article o'f 
vegetable food more widely useful and more universally liked 
than the apple. Let every housekeeper lay in a good supply of 
apples, and it will be the most economical investment in the 
whole range of culinaries. A raw, mellow apple is digested 
in an hour and a half, while boiled cabbage requires five hours. 
The most healthful dessert that can be placed on the table is 
apples cooked in some form. If eaten frequently at breakfast 
with coarse bread and butter, without meat or flesh of any 
kind, they have an admirable effect on the general system, 
often removing constipation, correcting acidities, and cooling 
off febrile conditions more effectually than the most approved 
medicines. If families could be induced to substitute apples — 
sound and ripe — for pies, cakes, and sweetmeats, with which 
their children are too frequently stuffed, there would be a dimi- 
nution in doctors' bills, in a single year, sufficient to lay in 
a stock of this delicious fruit for the whole season's use.

731. To Choose Apples. 

In choosing apples, be guided by the weight — the heaviest 
are the best ; and those should always be selected which, on 
being pressed by the thumb, yield to it, with a slight crackling 
noise. Prefer large apples to small; for waste is saved in 
peeling and coring them. 

732. How to Keep Apples. 

Pick them carefully ; place them one by one in a barrel, 
with holes in it, for air, or in a heap with straw ; keep them in 
a cool, dry place ; look them over once a month carefully ; 
pack none but sound ones ; if any are bruised or specked, pick 
them out and use them up. 

733- To Save Specked Apples. 

If you do not wish to use them by. any of the recipes below, 
pare, core, and stew with cider and sugar ; this makes a de- 
licious sauce, will keep any length of time, and is equal to 
Shaker apple sauce, being the same way they make it. Any 
empty fruit cans can be filled with it.

THE SICK-ROOM. 



225 



THE SICK ROOM, 

Hints for Attendants in the Sick Room. 

Do not get out of temper, but strive to make the sick cham- 
ber the pleasantest and yet the quietest portion of the house. 

Do not converse in whispers ; invalids generally are suspi- 
cious, and will imagine all sorts of things if they hear, but do 
not understand, a conversation in the room. 

Do not urge the invalid to eat and drink when he does not 
feel like it. 

Allow no unpleasant smells to pervade the room j prevent 
this by a thorough ventilation ; let in fresh air and sunshine 
freely and frequently ; never raise a dust, but wipe the floor 
or carpet with a damp cloth, and pick up bits as needed ; do 
not let lamp or sunlight shine directly in the eyes, and when 
the patient desires to sleep a little, darken the room somewhat ; 
do not wear rustling dresses. 

Keep everything that is used by the patient perfectly clean. 

Do not allow the nauseating medicine bottles to stand in the 
sight of the patient. 

Study all the peculiarities of your patient, and instead of 
opposing them by argument or otherwise, humor them, when- 
ever by so doing you do not interfere with the priysician's in- 
structions. 

Do not allow flowers or plants to be kept in the room too 
long, and especially over night. 

Proper nursing is an art, and should be studied as assiduously 
as any other. 

A cheerful, merry heart is indispensable in the sick room, 
and there is nothing better than a keen sense of the humorous- 
to arouse a smile, and if the patient is not too weak, a laugh, 
which is worth more than many drugs. No long faces should! 
be seen in the sick room, and no impatience or petulance. 
If, after having taken the utmost pains to have the food per* 



226 THE SICK-ROOM. 



feet, and served on the instant, do not be vexed if the poor 
worn and nervous patient should refuse the food, but put the 
matter in such facetious light that the patient will perhaps 
forget his lack of appetite, and may taste the food and eat it 
with a relish. Prepare only a small amount of anything, and 
never discuss it beforehand; a surprise will often rouse a 
flagging appetite. 

Never leave any article of diet in the sick room ; it is a good 
means of destroying the appetite, which should be encouraged 
and not weakened. 

Whatever is served, let great attention be paid to giving the 
dish, after it is properly cooked, a dainty appearance. Place 
it oil the choicest ware in the house, with the cleanest of nap- 
kins and the brightest of silver, even if that consists only of a 
teaspoon. 

If tea and toast be served, put the tea freshly drawn into the 
daintiest of teacups (every family might well afford to buy one 
little, thin china cup and saucer, to use in case of illness,) and 
serve with cut loaf sugar. A few drops of cream are easily 
saved for the patient's tea from a small quantity of milk ; and 
cream in small quantities is considered more digestible than 
milk. 

757- Tea. 

Tea is best made jn the sick room. With a small table at 
the side of the invalid's bed, it is a decidedly pleasant little 
diversion to make tea in this manner, being sure at the same 
time that it is perfectly fresh. But, however it is made, do net 
present a cupful of tea to the sufferer, with a part of it spilled 
in the saucer. 

758. Toast. 

All cooks think they can make toast. There is about one 
person in ten who really knows how ; there is. quite a difference 
between a thin and well yellowed crisp piece of toast with crust 
cut off, just from the fire, and a thick unshapely slice, un- 



GRUEL. 227 



evenly crisped on the outside and of doughy softness inside f 
one is appetizing and digestible j the other not. 

To make it properly, the bread should not be too fresh. It 
should be cut thin, evenly and in good shape, half an inch in 
thickness or even less — never more 5 the crust edges should be 
cut off, these pieces can be dried and saved for various purposes. 

Present each side of the bread to the fire for a few moments 
to warm, without attempting to toast it ; then turn the first 
side to the fire but at some distance from it, so that it may 
slowly and evenly receive a golden color over all the surface ; 
repeat the same with the other side. To insure success the 
coals should be clear and hot. Serve the moment it is done, 
on a warm plate. 

759. To Make Gruel. 

Pour a quart of hot water into a clean earthen or tin vessel 
over a brisk fire ; when it boils, add two large tablespoonfuls 
of corn or oatmeal ; mix it smooth in just enough water to 
thicken it ; put a small lump of butter into the water, and when 
melted, add the meal and stir for about half an hour ; then add 
a teacupful of sweet milk, and when it boils again, throw in 
the upper crust of hard baked bread cut into small pieces ; let 
it boil some time, and add a, little black pepper, a little salt, a 
pinch of grated nutmeg, a little, more butter and a teaspoonful 
of French brandy. The butter, spices, and brandy, should be 
omitted when the case is a serious one. 

760. Beef Tea. 

Take a pound of lean beef, cut it fine, put it in a bottle 
corked tightly, and put the bottle into a kettle of warm water ; 
the water should be allowed to boil for a considerable time ; 
the bottle should then be removed and the contents poured out. 
The tea may be salted a little, and a teaspoonful given each time. 

Another way of preparing it is as follows : Take a thick 
steak, broil slightly on a gridiron until the juices have started, 



2 28 THE SICK-ROOM. 



and then squeeze thoroughly with a lemon squeezer. The 
juice thus extracted will be highly nutritious. 

761. Toast Water. 

Toast slightly a piece of bread, and add to it boiling water ; 
if preferred, sweeten. It may be flavored with lemon or orange 

peel. 

762. Flax Seed Tea. 

Take an ounce of flax seed and a little pounded liquorice 
root, and pour on a pint of boiling water ; place the vessel near 
a fire for four hours ; strain through a linen or cotton cloth. 

763. Barley Coffee. 

Roast barley until well brown, and boil a tablespoonful of 
it in a pint of water for five minutes ; strain, and add a little 
sugar, if desired. A nourishing drink toward the close of fever 
and during convalescence. 

764. Oat Meal Coffee. 

Mix common oatmeal and water to form a cake 3 bake and 
brown it, powder it, and boil in water five minutes. Good 
for checking obstinate vomiting, especially in cholera morbus. 

765. Egg Brandy. 

Take the yolks of two eggs, beat well, and add half an 
ounce of white sugar, and a little cinnamon water, or two drops 
of oil of cinnamon. Mix well, and add a wineglassful of 
French brandy. 

766. Milk Punch. 

A teaspoonful of sugar and enough water to dissolve it ; pour 
in two gills or teacupfuls of milk, and then in a small stream 
stirring constantly, a tablespoonful or two of brandy or rum. 

767. Egg Nog. 

A teaspoonful of sugar well beaten with an egg, a gill or 
a teacupful of milk, and one or two tablespoonfuls of good 
French brandy. Flavor with grated nutmeg. 



SAGE TEA. 229 



768. Sage Tea. 

Dry leaves of sage, half an ounce ; boiling water, one quart ; 
infuse for half an hour, strain and add sugar and lemon juice as 
required by the patient. Balm and other teas are made in the 
same manner. 

769. Rice Water. 

Rice, two ounces ; water, two quarts ; boil an hour or so, 
and add sugar and nutmeg. 

770. Refreshing Drinks in Fevers. 

Put a little sage, two sprigs of balm, and a little sorrel into 
a stone jug ; peel a small lemon, slice it, and put in, together 
with a small piece of the rind ; then pour in three pints of 
boiling water, sweeten, and cover it close. 

Another. — Take half an ounce of prunes, or dried plums, 
an ounce of cranberries, half an ounce of stoned raisins, and a 
quart of water ; boil down to one pint, strain, and flavor with 
lemon peel, or essence of lemon. Keep it closely covered. 

Another — Take one ounce each of currants, raisins, and 
tamarinds or prunes, and boil in one quart of water down to 
one pint. Flavor with lemon peel, or essence of lemon. 

771. Fruit Drinks for Invalids. 

Currants, cranberries, and prunes make refreshing drinks, 
when added to water, and sweetened to suit the patient's taste. 

772. Water Gruel. 

Corn, or oatmeal two tablespoonfuls ; water, one quart ; 
boil for ten or fifteen minutes, and add sugar or salt, if desired 
by the patient.

Ground rice, one heaping tablespoonful ; ground cinnamon, 
half a teaspoonful ; water, one quart ; boil slowly for fifteen or 
twenty minutes, add the cinnamon near the conclusion of the

REMEDY FOR BURNS. 235 



805. Remedy for Burns. 

If the skin is not broken, wash with fluid turpentine, then 
cover with cotton batting or soft linen to exclude the air ; 
repeat the wash when the skin becomes dry ; this remedy will 
remove pain almost instantly. Another good remedy, when 
the skin is not broken, consists of applying cloths wet with 
essence of peppermint mixed with whisky or spirits ; one part 
peppermint to three of whisky. Peppermint and sweet oil is 
equally good, put on with cotton. The simplest and best 
remedy, however, in case the skin is broken, is to cover the 
burns with common wheat flour. 

806. Lait de Poule— (For Colds.) [Time.— Ten 

MINUTES.] 

Articles. — Haifa pint <*f milk, one egg, and one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar. 

Directions. —Beat the yolk of the egg and the sugar together, 
and the white separately ; mix the beaten yolk and sugar with 
the milk boiling hot ; stir very fast to prevent curdling ; then 
add the white next, stirring very rapidly ; drink as hot as pos- 
sible, justtbefore going to bed. 

Remarks — This is an excellent and old French remedy for a cold, and 
produces a gentle perspiration when other means fail. 

807. Eau Sedatif. (Raspail.) 

Dissolve two small handfuls of ordinary salt in one quart of 
water ; add one small wineglassful of spirits of camphor, and 
two small wineglassfuls of spirits of ammonia, mix well together, 
then filter through filtering paper or common brown wrapping 
paper and keep well corked. 

Remarks. — This is an old recipe from the eminent French physician, 
Raspail, and is used as an emollient for bruises, (when the skin is not 
broken) Rheumatism, Headache, etc. When used for Headache, reduce 
It one-half with water, wet a cloth and lay it on the head. When used for 
bruises, lameness, etc., rub the parts affected briskly with the mixture 
pure, and then rub with camphor lard. 



236 HOUSEHOLD REMEDIES. 

808. Camphor Lard. (RaspaiL)

809. To Stop Bleeding of the Nose. 

Find the artery on both sides of the face where it crosses 
the jaw, some two or three inches above the point of the chin, 
press it closely against the bone with the thumb and forefinger ; 
observe which nostril bleeds most freely, and press harder on 
that side. This gives speedy relief, and is far more agreeable 
than rolls of paper pressed above the front teeth, or cold keys 
and cold water applied to the back of the neck. 

810. Advice in Cases of Poisoning. 

Stir into a glass of water a heaping teaspoonful each of salt 
and mustard, and drink immediately. One or more doses

a cup or two of strong coffee. 

Sweet oil, taken freely, is excellent in cases of poisoning.

est, the Cheapest and Best Arranged Store 
west of New York City, carrying the 
Greatest Variety of 

PURE AND FIRST CLASS GOODS 

IN OUR LINE TO BE FOUND IN BUFFALO. 



Read our Instructions " How to Buy," — Page 4. 






To our Patrons and the Public. 



In presenting this "Descriptive list," of our Goods, we beg 
leave to call your attention to the following facts : 

First : This list necessarily cannot describe our whole stock, 
as we are daily adding novelties in the shape of Imported and Do- 
mestic Table Delicacies and staple goods as fast as they appear in the 
market. It only describes such goods as we had in stock at the time 
of publication. 

Second : We could not quote prices on all goods, they fluctu- 
ate so frequently that it would occasion confusion ; but the Public can 
rest assured that we will continue to maintain our reputation of sell- 
ing (quantity and quality considered), as low as the lowest. We re- 
ceive no worthless or adulterated goods, because they are cheap, and 
to offer at seemingly good bargains to catch the unwary and careless 
buyer, but handle only sound, pure goods, in qualities hmcever, to 
suit both large and small purses. 

Third : We carry a larger variety of goods in our line than 
any house in Buffalo ; this fact is becoming generally known to the 
people of Buffalo and vicinity, and the liberal patronage received up 
to the present time, shows ^that there was a want of an establishment 
like ours in this city, and that it is appreciated. 

It has always been our earnest endeavor to merit in every respect 
the confidence bestowed on us, by supplying the best, and the best 
only, of everything pertaining to our line of business, and that we 
have by so doing gained a liberal and constantly increasing patron- 
age and popularity, is to us a matter of considerable pride. 

With many thanks for past patronage, and soliciting a continu- 
ance of same, with the assurance that we will strive to maintain our 
present position of the 

Leading Grocery House of Buffalo, 

f We are yours, most respectfully.

How to Buy and Where 



There are two ways in whicn to supply your wants : One, to 
find a reliable merchant and 'make use of him whenever you have 
need ; the other, to go in search of so called " bargains" offered by 
adventurers. In one case you will get your money's worth of honest 
goods — no more ; in the other you will be served with spurious 
goods and only learn your loss, when your health tells you, you have 
been deceived. 

WHAT ADVANTAGES CAN WE OFFER ? 

We buy for cash and sell for cash, therefore no losses or bad 

debts are added to the cost of goods — to be paid by the purchaser 

a saving of ten per cent, at least. Our large sales enable us to buy 
large quantities, a saving of from 2 to 5 per cent., the benefit of 
which accrues to our patrons. Owing to rapid sales you are sure of 
getting Fresh Goods. 

^We give our patrons the option of the following modes of ordering : 
To those who cannot visit us personally, to get our prices and 
leave their orders, we will state, that they can send us their orders by 
mail for about the quality of goods they want, and can rest assured 
that the order will be filled at the lowest market price, on day of re- 
ceipt of order, or we will cheerfully quote prices on such goods as 
may be enquired for or wanted, and hold prices open for a reasonable 
length of time, and should the prices decline before shipment, our pat- 
rons will receive the benefit. 

Our method of payment is as follows : 

1. To responsible parties, furnishing satisfactory reference, 
goods will be shipped, subject to remittance after they have been re- 
ceived and examined. 

2. C. O. D. by freight, to our firm name, and draft accompa- 
nied by Bill of Lading, made on the party ordering, through a Bank 
or Express Co. 

3. C. O. D. by Express, (light packages, as teas, spices, etc., etc). 

4. Cash, or Draft or Post Office Money Order to accompany 
the order for goods. 

N. B. Make Checks, Post Office Orders or Drafts payable to 
the order of Dingens Brothers. 

When Clubs order from us, we parcel each one's goods separately, 
(if desired) and mark the names and contents plainly on each pack- 
age, and pack in a barrel or box. No charge for package, nor 
for cartage to depots. 

Address simply, Dingens Brothers, Buffalo, N.Y.

NOTE THESE FACTS, 



WE ARE HEAD-QUARTERS FOR "TEAS AND COFFEES.' 



Our combination "Java and Mocha Coffee" is acknowl- 
edged to be The Coffee, Par Excellence, and is acquiringa reputa- 
tion that we are proud of, and will endeavor to maintain at any cost. 

The secret of its popularity is due, first, to the careful blending 
of the finest grades of Mocha and Java, in such proportions as to 
give a certain tone to the too mild properties of the Java (when used 
alone), by a sufficient quantity of the strong and subtle Mocha. 
Independent of- this secret of the proper proportions, when we find 
the coffees that produce the desired result, we purchase the entire 
line, thereby insuring a continued similarity in our combination. 
Again, these large purchases which enable us to procure the goods 
at prices way below the price paid by Grocers who purchase only 
from second or third hands, enable us to give a better quality for 
the price we ask, than the generality of dealers. 

Not one Grocer in ten, buys the green coffee and has it roasted, 
but sells you a coffee purchased from Spice Dealers, called Java and 
Mocha, and he nor you can tell what you are getting. 

Last but not least, our large sales enable us to send out coffees 
freshly roasted. We Roast Daily. 

We earnestly solicit a trial order of this celebrated combina-

PERSYMONS' 



RYE & BOURBON WHISKIES, 



The grains from which American Whiskies are distilled, contain finer oils as 
regards aroma and taste, than any material used in the distillation of imported 
spirits ; but, unfortunately, also oils, ethers and acids that are injurious to the 
health. The theory that age causes these injurious properties to evaporate is ex- 
ploded. 

IT "WOIN~'T ! 

Distillers have in vain sought to rid Whiskies of these oils. It was left for a 
French Distiller, (M. Persymons, ) to perfect a still that accomplishes this. 

D1NGENS BROTHERS, OF BUFFALO, N. Y, 

In 1871, obtained this secret, and then first made Whiskies by this process. They 
tested them for more than two years, in every conceivable manner, and satisfied 
that the product was a Whiskey 

PURE AND UNPREJUDICIAL TO THE NERYES, 

only then offered it to the public under the title of 

" OLD PERSYMONS WHISKEY," RYE OR BOURBON. 



The Genuine bears onr Signature and Seal. 




NAPOLEON BITTERS

PREPARED PUNCHES 



<( FOR } 



HOT OR COLD DRINKS. 



After deep research and manifold experiments, we have succeeded in pro- 
ducing an article or compound, the want of which has long been felt, namely : 
a method of preparing a FRAGRANT PUNCH, equal to the best prepared in 
the usual old style, and conceded by many far superior, at a saving of labor, 
material and cost amounting to from 50 to 100 per cent. JVo LemO?lS ! J\To 
Sugar! nothing but water needed. How often a merchant, a mechanic or a 
laborer, returning home, cold and weary, after his day's labor, feels the need of 
a stimulant. How invigorating and soothing would a punch feel, but " no lem- 
ons in the house," " crushed sugar just out," no punch to be had. But hold ! 

Here is a bottle of Dingfens' Nectar, Cognac, Scotch Whis- 
key or other Prepared Punch ! " How handy ! " exclaims the good 
housewife, and in a moment a fragrant punch, possessing all the requisite flavor, 
is prepared, and health and happiness is the result. Many imitations of our 
Prepared Punches, under different names, have been thrown into the market ; 
but when compared with the genuine Dingens' Prepared Punches, the difference 
was so palpable that it has only strengthened public opinion in our favor. For 
sale by the trade generally. 



A DOLLAR BOTTLE WILL PRODUCE OVER 20 PUNCHES.

MEASUREMENTS. 259 



PART II. 

-:o: 

There are natural cooks as well as natural musicians, and 
there is a charm in both that can never be reached by art. 
The delicate taste that decides whether there shall be a grain 
more of this or that in the seasoning of a soup ; the eye that 
discerns, as by intuition, whether the gravy is of the proper 
thickness, the rolls just light enough for the oven, and the jelly 
of perfect shade and stiffness ; are like an exquisite ear, beautiful 
taste, and graceful touch in music. They are rare gifts, however, 
and the majority of those who would excel in either art must 
accept the necessity of scales and measures. For exactness of 
proportions it is safer to weigh solids and measure fluids ; to 
weigh even by ounces and half ounces, and to measure even by 
gills and half gills. 

Teacups and tablespoons, dessert and teaspoons vary in size, 
and it is> moreover, difficult to know how closely the butter, 
flour, or brown sugar may lie in them. If a recipe says 
" heaping " it is very indefinite, as a teaspoon may be heaped 
from one-third to double its even quantity ; and the " scant 
cup of butter " may have an easy range, varying in weight 
from half an ounce to an ounce and a half. It seems impossi- 
ble, however, to avoid using a tablespoon and teaspoon as 
measures, a tablespoonful of flour being less than half an ounce, 
and a teaspoonful of the same still more difficult to weigh. 
Many cooking spoons hold very much more than tablespoons, 
and cannot be used for this purpose. The true tablespoon 
measure is one-eighth of a gill, and the teaspoon used in these 
recipes holds one-third of a tablespoonful. No rule is given 
in which the measure is heaped. In many cases the word even 
precedes the measure, but it is simply for the safety of those 
who may not have read this explanation. But with all thi s 



260 MEASUREMENTS. 



exactness in measuring and weighing, it must be remembered 
that good ingredients are indispensable to success ; the best 
cooking cannot make a good dish of a joint of meat too 
recently killed or too long hung, nor a palatable omelette from 
eggs that are not perfectly fresh ; nor with the utmost skill can 
good bread be made from poor flour, nor good cake with any 
other than sweet butter.

SOUPS. 

837. Stock. 

A diversity of opinion exists as to the quality of soups and 
dishes prepared from stock. While some cook-books are 
silent upon the subject, most of them advocate the preparation 
of stock, and claim that no kitchen should be withouc it; true, 



SOUPS. 26] 



it is useful in the preparation of some sauces and is economical, 
but to us there is a sameness of flavor in all dishes prepared 
from stock, that reminds one of hotel soups and dishes, which 
all taste alike. However, as our aim is to suit all tastes, we give 
the best methods of preparing stock, also full recipes for the 
production of soups without the use of stock. In the preparation 
of stock the first essential is a tightly-covered kettle, either 
tinned iron or porcelain lined, holding not less than two 
gallons ; three being a preferable size. Whether cooked or 
uncooked meat is used it should be cut into small bits, and all 
bones broken or sawn into short pieces, that the marrow may 
be easily extracted. 

To every pound of meat and bone allow one quart of cold 
water, one even teaspoonful of salt, and half a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Let the meat stand till the water is slightly colored 
with its juice ; then set it upon the fire, and let it come slowly 
to a boil, skimming off every particle of scum as it rises. The 
least neglect of this point will give a broth in which bits of 
dark slime float about, unpleasant to sight and taste. A cup 
of cold water, thrown in as the kettle boils, will make the scum 
rise more freely. Let it boil steadily, but very slowly, allowing 
an hour to each pound of meat. The water will boil away, 
leaving, at the end of the time specified, not more than half or 
one-third the. original amount. In winter this will become a 
firm jelly, which can be used by simply melting it, thus ob- 
taining a strong, clear broth ; or can be diluted with an equal 
quantity of water, and vegetables added for a vegetable soup. 

The meat used in stock, if boiled the full length of time 
given, has parted with all its juices, and is therefore useless as 
food. Strain, when done, into a stone pot or crock kept for 
the purpose, and, when cold, remove the cake of fat which 
will rise to the top. This fat, melted and strained, serves for 
many purposes better than lard. If the stock is to be kept 
several days, leave the fat on till ready to use it! Fresh and 



262 SOUPS. 



cooked meat may be used together, and all remains of poultry 
or game, and trimmings of chops and steaks, may be added; 
mutton being the only meat which cannot well be used in 
combination ; though even this, by trimming off all the fat, 
may also be added. If it is intended to keep the stock some 
days, no vegetables should be added, as vegetable juices fer- 
ment very easily. 

In order to prepare soup, it is only necessary just before 
dinner each day, to cut off some of the jelly and heat it. It is 
very good with nothing additional ; but one can have a change 
of soup each day by adding different flavorings, such as onion, 
macaroni, vermicelli, tomato, tapioca, sago, spring vegetables 
(which will make a Julienne), poached eggs, fried bread, 
asparagus, celery, green peas, etc. Stock is also valuable for 
gravies, sauces, and stews. 

The secret of a savory soup lies in many flavors, none of 
which are allowed to predominate, and careful and frequent 
tasting is very essential to insure success.

but do not let it cease to boil during this time ; at the end of 
four hours strain the soup, and add the finer parts of the turtle 
and the green fat, which has simmered for one hour in two 
quarts of water ; thicken with browned flour, return to the 
soup pot, and simmer gently an hour longer ; if there are eggs 
in the turtle, boil them in a separate \ essel for four hours, and 
throw into the soup before taking it up ; if not, put in force- 
meat balls, then the juice of the lemon, and the wine ; some 
cooks add the finer meat before straining, boiling all together 
five hours; then strain, thicken, and put in the green fat 
cut into lumps an inch long ; this makes a handsomer soup 
than if the meat is left in ; for the mock eggs take the yolks of 
three hard boiled eggs, and one raw egg well beaten ; rub the 
boiled eggs into a paste with a teaspoonful of butter, bind with 
the raw egg, roll into pellets the size and shape of turtle eggs, 
and lay in boiling water for two minutes before dropping into 
the soup. To make forcemeat balls for the above take six 
tablespoonfuls of turtle meat chopped very fine ; rub to a paste 
with the yolks of two hard boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of 
butter and, if convenient, a little oyster liquor ; season with 
cayenne, mace, and half a teaspoonful of white sugar, bind 
with a well beaten egg, shape into balls, dip in egg, then 
powdered cracker, fry in butter, and drop into the soup when 
it is served.

278 



SOUPS. 



to serve lay a dozen or more in the tureen and pour the soup 
on them. 

879. Another Recipe for Forcemeat Balls. 

Articles. — Any kind of meat, chicken, or broth, (the kind 
of meat used in making the soup for which the forcemeat balls 
are required may also be used,) salt, pepper, parsley, thyme, or 
a little parsley and fried onion, or thyme alone, or parsley 
alone, a little lemon juice and grated peel, one egg, and a little 
flour. 

Directions. — Chop the meat very fine, season it with the 
pepper and salt, add your chopped herbs or onion, lemon juice 
and rind, break in the raw egg and stir in a little flour, enough 
to make a soft paste, roll in little balls, the size of pigeons 
eggs, fry them in a little butter, or they may be cooked in 
boiling water, or they may be egged, and bread crumbed, and 
fried in boiling lard. Just before serving the soup, place them 
in the tureen and pour the soup on them. 

880. Croutons or Bread Dice for Soups. 

Cut moderately thick slices of stale bread, take off the crust 
and cut the rest into small dice, put them in the frying basket, 
sink it into hot lard or drippings and remove it as soon as the 
bread is browned and let it drain. They may be served with 
the soup, in a dish alone, or scattered over the top in the tureen. 

881. Egg Balls for Soups. 

Articles. — The yolks of two hard boiled eggs, the raw yolk 
of one egg, one tablespoonful of melted butter, a little salt and 
pepper, and enough sifted flour to make it consistent enough 
to handle. 

Directions. — Mix together, sprinkle a little flour on the 
board, roll out your mixture, about half an inch thick, cut it 
into dice and roll each one into little balls in the palm of the 
hand ; put these into the soup to cook, about five minutes 
before serving. 



FISH. 



279 



FISH. 
882. To Select Fish. 

The most essential point in choosing fish is their freshness, 
and this is determined as follows : if the gills are red, the eyes 
prominent and full, and the whole fish stiff, they are good ; 
but if the eyes are sunken, the gills pale, and the fish flabby, 
they are stale and unwholesome, and, though often eaten in 
this condition, lack all the fine flavor of a freshly-caught fish. 

The fish being chosen, the greatest care is necessary in clean- 
ing. If this is properly done, one washing will be sufficient ; 
the custom of allowing fresh fish to lie in water after cleaning, 
destroys much of their flavor. 

Another very essential point is this : fish to be palatable and 
healthy must be thoroughly cooked. 

Fresh-water fish, especially the cat-fish, have often a muddy 
taste and smell. To get rid of this, soak in water strongly 
salted ; say, a cupful of salt to a gallon of water ; letting it heat 
gradually in this, and boiling it for one minute; then drying 
it thoroughly before cooking. 

All fish for boiling should be put into cold water, with the 
exception of salmon, which loses its color unless put into boil- 
ing water. A tablespoonful each of salt and vinegar to every 
two quarts of water, improves the flavor of all boiled fish, and 
also makes the flesh firmer. Allow ten minutes to the pound 
after the fish begins to boil, and test with a knitting needle or 
sharp skewer. If it runs in easily, the fish can be taken off. 
If a fish-kettle with strainer is used, the fish can be lifted out 
without danger of breaking. If not, it should be thoroughly 
dredged with flour, and served in a cloth kept for the purpose. 
In all cases drain it perfectly, and send to table on a folded 
napkin laid upon the platter. 

In frying, fish should, like all fried articles, be immersed in 
the hot lard or drippings. Small fish may be fried whole : 
larger ones boned, and cut in small pieces. If they are egged 



280 FISH. 



and crumbed, the egg will form a covering, hardening at once, 
and absolutely impervious to fat. 

Pan-fish, as they are called — flounders and small fish gen- 
erally — can also be fried by rolling in Indian meal or flour, 
and browning in the fat of salt pork. 

Baking and broiling preserve the flavor most thoroughly. 

Cold boiled fish can always be used, either by spicing as in 
the rule to be given, or by warming again in a little butter and 
water. Cold fried or broiled fish can be put in a pan, and set 
in the oven till hot, this requiring not over ten minutes ; a 
longer time giving a strong, oily taste, which spoils it. Plain 
boiled or mashed potatoes are always served with fish where 
used as a dinner course. If fish is boiled whole, do not cut 
off either tail or head. The tail can be skewered in the mouth 
if desired ; or a large fish may be boiled in the shape of the letter 
S by threading a trussing needle, fastening a string around the 
head, then passing the needle through the middle of the body, . 
drawing the string tight and fastening it around the tail. 

883. Baked Fish. 

Article. — Bass, fresh shad, blue-fish, pickerel, etc., maybe 
cooked in this way. 

Directions. — See that the fish has been properly cleaned. 
Wash in salt water, and wipe dry. For stuffing for a fish 
weighing from four to six pounds, take four large crackers, or 
four ounces of bread crumbs ; quarter of a pound of salt pork > 
one teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoonful of pepper ; 
one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, or a teaspoonful of thyme. 
Chop half the pork fine, and mix with the crumbs and season- 
ing, using half a cup of hot water to mix them, or, if preferred, 
a beaten egg. Put this dressing into the body of the fish, 
which is then to be fastened together with a skewer. Cut the 
remainder of the pork in narrow strips, and lay it in gashes cut 
across the back of the fish about two inches apart. Dredge 
thickly with flour, using about two tablespoonfuls. Put a tin 



'10 W TO' BAKE. 



28r 



baking-sheet in the bottom of a pan, as without it the fish can 
not be easily taken up. Lay the fish on this, pour a cup of 
boiling water into the pan, and bake in a hot oven for one 
hour, basting it very often that the skin may not crack ; and, 
at the end of half an hour, dredging again with flour, repeating; 
this every ten minutes till the fish is done. If the water dries- 
away, add enough to preserve the original quantity. When 
the fish is done, slide it carefully from the tin sheet on to a. 
hot platter. Set the baking pan on top of the stove. Mix a. 
teaspoonful of flour with quarter of a cup of cold water, and 
stir into the boiling gravy. A tablespoonful of walnut or 
mushroom catsup, or of Worcestershire or lime juice sauce, 
may be added if liked. Serve very hot. 

Before sending a baked fish to table, take out the skewer. 
When done, it should have a handsome brown crust. If pork 
is disliked, it may be omitted altogether, and a tablespoonful 
of butter substituted in the stuffing. Basting should be done 
as often as once in ten minutes, else the skin will blister and 
crack. Where the fish is large, it will be better to sew the 
body together after stuffing, rather than to use a skewer. The 
string can be cut and removed before serving. 

If any is left it can be warmed in the remains of the gravy, 
or, if this has been used, make a gravy of one cup of hot water, 
thicken with one teaspoonful of flour or corn starch stirred 
smooth first in a little cold water. Add a tablespoonful of 
butter and any catsup or sauce desired. Take all bones from 
the fish ; break it up in small pieces, and stew not over five 
minutes in the gravy. Or it can be mixed with an equal 
amount of mashed potato or bread crumbs, a cup of milk and 
an egg, with a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper 
and baked until brown, about fifteen minutes, in ahot oven. 
884. To Bake Fish with Wine. 
Stuff a fish with the following dressing : soak some bread in 
water, squeeze it dry, and add an egg well beaten. Season 



282 FISH. 

it with pepper, salt, and a little parsley or thyme ; grease the 
baking pan (one just the right size for holding the fish) with 
butter ; season the fish on top and put it into the pan with 
about two cups of boiling water ; baste it well, adding more 
boiling water when necessary. About twenty minutes before 
serving, pour over it a cup of claret or Sauterne wine (or if 
sherry or port wine is used, only half a cupful) add a small 
piece of butter, two or three tablespoonfuls of lime juice sauce 
or Worcestershire sauce to the wine and stir it well together 
before pouring over the fish, put half a lemon sliced into the 
gravy ; baste the fish again well; when it is thoroughly baked 
remove it from the pan ; garnish the top with the slices of 
lemon ; finish the sauce in the baking dish by adding a little 
butter rubbed to a paste in some flour ; strain, skim and serve 
in a sauce boat. 

885. To Boil Fish. 

General directions have already been given. All fish must 
boil very gently, or the outside will break before the inside is 
done. In all cases salt and a little vinegar, a teaspoonful 
each, are allowed to each quart of water. Where the fish has 
very little flavor, the following recipe for boiling will be found 
exceedingly nice : 

Mince a carrot, an onion, and one stalk of celery, and fry 
them in a little butter. Add two or three sprigs of parsley, 
two tablespoonfuls of salt, six pepper-corns, and three cloves. 
Pour on two quarts of boiling water and one pint of vinegar, 
and boil for fifteen minutes. Skim as it boils, and use, when 
cold, for boiling the fish. Wine may be used instead of vinegar ; 
and, by straining carefully and keeping in a cold place, the 
same mixture can be used several times. 

886. To Broil Fish. 

If the fish is large, it should be split, in order to ensure its 
being cooked through ; though notches may be cut at equal 
distances, so that the heat can penetrate. Small fish may be 



HOW TO BROIL. 283 



broiled whole. The gridiron should be well greased with 
dripping or olive oil. If a double wire gridiron is used, there 
will be no trouble in turning either large or small fish. If a 
single-wire or old-fashioned iron one, the best way is to first 
loosen with a knife any part that sticks ; then, holding a platter 
over the fish with one hand, turn the gridiron with the other, 
and the fish can then be returned to it without breaking. 

Small fish require a hot, clear fire ; large ones, a more 
moderate one, that the outside may not be burned before the 
inside is done. Cook always with the skin-side down at first, 
and broil to a golden brown, — this requiring, for small fish, 
ten minutes ; for large ones, from ten to twenty, according to 
size. When done, pepper and salt lightly ; and to a two- 
pound fish allow a tablespoonful of butter spread over it. Set 
the fish in the oven a moment, that the butter may soak in, 
and then serve. A teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and half 
a lemon squeezed over shad or any fresh fish, is a very nice 
addition. Where butter, lemon, and parsley are blended 
beforehand, it makes the sauce known as maitre d' hotel sauce, 
which is especially good for broiled shad. 

In broiling steaks or cutlets of large fish, — say, salmon, 
halibut, fresh cod, etc., the same general directions apply. 
Where very delicate broiling is desired, the pieces of fish can 
be wrapped in buttered paper before laying on the gridiron ; 
this applying particularly to salmon. 

887. *Tx> Fry Fish. 

Small fish — such as trout, perch, smelts, etc., may simply be 
rolled in Indian meal or flour, and fried either in the fat of 
salt pork, or in boiling lard or drippings. A nicer method, 
however, with fish, whether small or in slices, is to dip them 
first in flour or fine crumbs, then in beaten egg, — one egg, with 
two tablespoonfuls of cold water and half a teaspoonful of salt, 
being enough for two ^iozen smelts ; then rolling again in 
crumbs or meal, and dropping into hot lard. The egg hardens 



284 FISH. 

instantly, and not a drop of fat can penetrate the inside. Fry 
to a golden brown. Take out with a skimmer ; lay in the 
oven on a double brown paper for a moment, and then serve. 

Filets of fish are merely flounders, or any flat fish with few 
bones, boned, skinned, and cut in small pieces; then egged 
and fried. 

To bone a fish of this sort use a very sharp knife. The fish 
should have been scaled, but not cleaned or cut open. Make 
a cut down the back from head to tail. Now, holding the knife 
pressed close to the bone, cut carefully till the fish is free on 
one side ; then turn, and cut away the other. To skin, take 
half the fish at a time firmly in one hand ; hold the blade of 
the knife flat as in boning, and run it slowly between skin and 
flesh. Cut the fish into small diamond-shaped pieces ; egg, 
crumb, and put into shape with the knife ; and then fry. The 
operation is less troublesome than it sounds, and the result 
most satisfactory. 

The bones and trimmings remaining can either be stewed 
in a pint of water till done, adding half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a saltspoonful of pepper, and a tablespoonful of catsup ; strain- 
ing the gravy off, and thickening with one heaping teaspoonful 
of flour dissolved in a little cold water ; or they can be broiled. 
For broiled bones, mix one saltspoonful of mustard, as much 
cayenne as could be taken up on the point of a penknife, a 
saltspoonful of salt, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. A table- 
spoonful of olive-oil may be added, if liked. Lay the bone in 
this, turning it till all is absorbed ; broil over a quick fire, and 
serve very hot. 

Fish may also be fried in batter, or these pieces, or filets, 
may be laid on a buttered dish ; a simple drawn butter or cream 
sauce poured over them ; the whole covered with rolled bread 
or cracker crumbs, dotted with bits of butter, and baked half 
an hour. A cup of canned mushrooms is often added. 



HOW TO STEW. 285 



888. To Stew Fish, or Fish en Matelote. 

Any fresh-water fish is good, cooked in this way ; cat-fish 
which have been soaked in salted water, to take away the 
muddy taste, being especially nice. Cut the fish in small pieces. 
Boil two sliced onions in a cup of water. Pour off this water • 
add another cupful, and two tablespoonfuls of wine, a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper, and salt to taste (about half a teaspoonful). Put 
in the fish, and cook for twenty minutes. Thicken the gravy 
with a heaping teaspoonful of flour, rubbed to a cream with a 
teaspoonful of- butter. If wine is not used, add a sprig of 
•chopped parsley and the juice of half a lemon. 

These methods will be found sufficient for all fresh fish, no 
other special rules being necessary. Experience and individual 
taste will guide their application. If the fish is oily, as in the 
case of mackerel or herring, broiling will always be better than 
frying. If fried, let it be with very little fat, as their own oil 
will furnish part. 

889. To Boil Salt Codfish. 

The large, white cod, which cuts into firm, solid slices, 
should be used. If properly prepared, there is no need of the 
strong smell, which makes it so offensive to many, and which 
comes only in boiling. The fish is now to be had boned, and 
put up in small boxes, and this is by far the most desirable 
form. In either case, lay in tepid water skin side up, and 
soak all night. If the skin is down, the salt, instead of soaking 
out, settles against it, and is retained. Change the water in 
the morning, and soak two or three hours longer ; then, after 
scraping and cleaning thoroughly, put in a kettle with tepid 
water enough to well cover it, and set it where it will heat to 
the scalding point, but not boil. Keep it at this point, but 
never let it boil a moment. Let it cook in this way an hour ; 
two will do no harm. Remove every particle of bone and dark 
skin before serving, sending it to table in delicate pieces, none 



286 



FISH. 



of which need be rejected. With egg sauce,, mashed or mealy 
boiled potatoes, and sugar beets, this makes the New England 
" fish dinner " a thing of terror when poorly prepared, but 
both savory and delicate where the above rule is closely followed. 
Fish balls, and all the various modes of using salted codj, 
require this preparation beforehand. 

890. Salt Cod with Cream. 

Flake two pounds of cold boiled salt cod very fine. Boil 
one pint of milk. Mix butter the size of a small egg with two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir into it. Add a few sprigs of 
parsley or half an onion minced very fine, a pinch of cayenne 
pepper, and half a teaspoonful of salt. Butter a quart pudding 
dish, and put in alternate layers of dressing and fish till nearly 
full. Cover the top with sifted bread or cracker crumbs, dot 
with bits of butter, and brown in a quick oven about twenty 
minutes. The fish may be mixed with an equal part of mashed 
potato, and baked ; and not only codfish, but any boiled fresh 
fish can be used, in which case double the measure of salt 
given will be required. 

891. Spiced Fish. 

Any remains of cold fresh fish may be used. Take out all 
bones or bits of skin. Lay in a deep dish, and barely cover 
with hot vinegar in which a few cloves and allspice have been 
boiled. It is ready for use as soon as cold. 

892. Potted Fish. 

Fresh herring or mackerel or shad may be used. Skin the 
fish, and cut in small pieces, packing them in a small stone 
jar. Just cover with vinegar. For six pounds of fish allow one 
tablespoonful of salt, and a dozen each of whole allspice, 
cloves, and pepper corns. Tie a thick paper over the top of 
the cover, and bake five hours. The vinegar dissolves the- 
bones perfectly, and the fish is an excellent relish at supper. 



CHOWDER. 2S7 



893. Fish Chowder. 

Articles. — Three pounds of any sort of fresh fish may be 
taken ; but fresh cod is always best ; six large potatoes and 
two onions, with half a pound of salt pork. 

Directions. — Cut the pork into dice, and fry to a light 
brown. Add the onions, and brown them also. Pour the 
remaining fat into a large saucepan, or butter it, as preferred. 
Put in a layer of potatoes, a little onion and pork, and a layer 
of the fish cut in small pieces, salting and peppering each layer. 
A tablespoonful of salt and one teaspoonful of pepper will be 
a mild seasoning. A pinch of cayenne may be added, if desired. 
Barely cover with boiling water, and boil for half an hour. In 
the meantime boil a pint of milk, and, when at boiling point, 
break into it three ship biscuit or half a dozen large crackers ; 
add a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Put the chowder in a 
platter, and pile the softened crackers on top, pouring the milk 
over all. Or the milk may be poured directly into the chowder • 
the crackers laid in, and softened in the steam ; and the whole 
served in a tureen. Three or four tomatoes are sometimes 
added. In clam chowder the same rule would be followed, 
substituting one hundred clams for the fish, and using a small 
can of tomatoes if fresh ones were not in season. 

894. Fish au Gratin. 

This is one of the favorite methods employed by the French 
in cooking fish, it being served in the same dish in which it is 
cooked. The gratin dish is an oval silver plated platter, but 
is also made of block tin. Put into a saucepan a piece of butter 
the size of an egg, then a handful of shallots, or one large 
onion minced fine, let it cook ten minuted, then mix in half a 
cupful of flour ; then mince three-fourths of a cupful of fresh 
mushrooms, or a can of canned mushrooms, add a teacupful 
of water (or stock if you have it) to the saucepan, then a glass 
of claret or Sauterne wine, salt and pepper to taste ; after mixing 



z88 



FISH. 



well in the saucepan add the minced mushrooms and a little 
minced parsley ; skin the fish, cut off the head and tail, split 
in two, laying bare the middle bone ; slip the knife under the 
bone removing it smoothly ; now cut the fish in pieces about 
an inch long, moisten the gratin dish with butter, arrange the 
cuts of fish tastefully on it, pour over the sauce, then sprinkle 
the whole with bread crumbs which have been dried and grated : 
put little pieces of butter over all and bake. The dish may be 
garnished with little diamonds of fried or toasted, and buttered 
bread around the edge. 

895. Fish a la Creme. 

Boil a fish weighing four pounds in salted water, when done 
remove the skin and flake it, leaving out the bones ; boil one 
quart of rich milk, mix a piece of butter the size of a small 
egg with three tablespoonfuls of flour, stir it smoothly in the 
milk, adding also two or three sprigs of parsley, half an onion 
chopped fine, a little cayenne pepper, and salt, stir it over the 
fire until it has thickened ; butter a gratin dish, put in first a 
layer of fish, then of dressing, and continue in alternation 
until all the fish is used, with dressing on top ; sprinkle sifted 
bread crumbs over the top and bake half an hour ; garnish 
with parsley and slices of hard boiled eggs. 

896. Broiled Fresh Mackerel. 

Clean the mackerel, wash, and wipe dry ; split it open, so 
that when laid flat, the backbone will be in the middle ; sprinkle 
lightly with salt, and lay on a buttered gridiron over a clear 
fire, with the inside downward, until it begins to brown ; then 
turn the other ; when quite done, lay on a hot dish and butter 
it well; turn another hot dish over the lower one, and let it 
stand two or three minutes before sending to the table. 

897. Broiled Salt Mackerel. 

Soak over night in lukewarm water, skin side* up, change

lay in it until time to cook, then proceed as with the fresh 
mackerel. 

898. Halibut Steak. 

Wash and wipe the steaks dry, beat up two or three eggs, and 
roll out some soda crackers until they are quite fine ; salt each 
steak, then dip it into the beaten eggs, then into the cracker 
crumbs ; fry in hot lard, or you can broil the steak upon a 
buttered gridiron, over a clear fire, first seasoning with salt 
and pepper ; when done, lay in a hot dish, butter well and 

cover closely. 

899. Stewed Sturgeon. 

Boil five pounds of sturgeon, well covered with water, to 
extract the oil ; (this is necessary whether the fish is to be 
baked, fried, or stewed); to one-quarter of a pound of butter 
add red and black peppers, mustard, salt, and vinegar to the 
taste j when the ingredients are well incorporated, stir in the 
sturgeon, which having been boiled until perfectly tender is 
picked very fine ; heat the whole together and serve very hot. 
The above dressing may be used for baked sturgeon. 

900. Sturgeon Steak. 

Skin the steak carefully and lay it in the salted water (cold) 
for an hour to remove the oily taste so offensive to most palates ; 
then wipe each steak dry, salt, and broil over hot coals on a but- 
tered gridiron, serve in a hot dish and when you have buttered and 
peppered them, serve garnished with parsley and accompanied 
by a small glass dish containing sliced lemon ; or you can 
pour over them a sauce prepared this way : put a tablespoonful 
of butter into a frying pan and stir it until it is brown (not 
burned), add half a teacupful of boiling water in which has 
been stirred a tablespoonful of browned flour previously wet with 
cold water ; add salt, a teaspoonful of Worcestershire or 
anchovy sauce, the juice of a lemon, let it boil up well, and 
pour over the steaks when you have arranged them in the dish-

teaspoonful of salt, one large cup of milk, and two eggs well 
beaten ; stir eggs and milk together ; add the flour slowly and 
last the clams or oysters ; drop by spoonfuls into boiling lard ; 
fry to a golden brown and serve at once, or they may be fried 
like pancakes in a little hot fat. Whole clams or oysters may 
be used instead of chopped ones and fried singly. 

907. Oysters for Pies or Patties. 

Put one quart of oysters on to boil in their own liquor, turn 
them while boiling into a colander to drain ; melt a piece of 
butter the size of an egg in the saucepan, add a tablespoonful 
of sifted flour, stir one minute, and pour in the oyster liquor 
slowly, which must not be less than a large cupful ; beat the

Articles. — Twelve large or twenty-four small oysters, six 
eggs, one cup of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, chopped 
parsley, salt and pepper. 

Directions. — Chop the oysters very fine and beat the yolks 
and whites of the eggs separately ; stir the yolks with the milk 
and seasoning, next put in the chopped oysters, and mix well, 
then add the tablespoonful of butter first melted ; finally whip 
in the whites lightly, and with as few strokes as possible ; while 
you are preparing the batter have your frying-pan ready with three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, melted and hot ; then place your mix- 
ture in the pan ; do not stir it, but when it begins to* set, slip a 
broad-bladed, round-pointed knife around the sides and under 
the omelet that the butter may reach every part ; as soon as the 
centre is fairly set turn into a hot dish bottom upward. 

909. Oysters and Macaroni. 

Lay some stewed macaroni in a deep dish, put upon it a 
thick layer of oysters, seasoned with cayenne pepper and 
grated lemon rind ; add a small teacupful of cream ; strew 
bread crumbs over the top, brown it in a pretty quick oven, 
and serve hot with a piquante sauce. 

910. Oysters Vol-au-Vent. 

Quarter some sweetbreads after they have soaked and 
branched, put them into a stew pan with a very little veal 
gravy, and the liquor strained off two dozen oysters, adding a 
very little salt ; then put two ounces of butter into a stew pan, 
stir it and thicken it with flour, and when the sweetbreads are 
sufficiently stewed add them with the gravy ; after a few min- 
utes put in the oysters, let them stew until heated through, 
and just before serving add a wineglassful of cream. 



OYSTERS AND TRIPE. 293

tripe for sweetbreads, and omitting the veal gravy, and pro^ 
ceeding in the same manner as above. 

912. Oysters and Chestnuts.

and fry brown ; in the same manner treat a number of blanched 
Spanish chestnuts ; make a sauce with the oyster liquor, a piece 
of butter rubbed in flour, and two glasses of white wine ; stew 
the chestnuts in this, add some yolk of egg to thicken and pour 
it upon the oysters. 

In Part I. will be found over thirty different recipes for oysters. 

CLAMS. 

913. Clams Cooked with Cream. 

Chop fifty small clams (not too fine) and season them with 
pepper and salt ; put into a stew pan a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, and when it bubbles sprinkle in a teaspoonful of 
flour, which cook a few minutes ; stir gradually into it the 
clam liquor, then the clams, which stew about two or three 
minutes, then add a cupful of boiling cream and serve 
immediately.

quart of cold water ; replace upon the fire and boil until the 
potatoes are cooked ; test by breaking with a fork, then add 
the clams, now mix smoothly one pint of milk with two and 
one-half ounces of flour, and add it to the chowder ; let the 
whole boil up, remove from the fire and serve ; crackers or 
pilot bread may be added if desired just after the clams are put 
in ; clams may be chopped fine or not, as preferred. 

915. Clam Chowder, No. 2. 

Articles. — Two hundred clams, one large onion, twenty 
large crackers, one can of tomatoes, some parsley chopped 
fine, half a pound of butter, one large teaspoonful each of

flour, then in egg (half a cupful of milk mixed with one egg~) 
then in cracker dust and fry them in boiling lard. 

917. Crabs a la Russe. 

Boil them half an hour with a little salt ; when done wipe 
dry, take off the shell, take out the blue veins, and what is 
called the lady fingers, as they are unwholesome ; send to the 
table cold, garnish with parsley or sliced lemon or both. 

918. Devilled Crabs. 

Remove the meat from the shell, mix it with bread crumbs 
— about one-quarter will be sufficient, add white pepper, salt, 
a little cayenne, a little grated nutmeg, to taste ; replace the 



LOBSTER PATTIES. 295 



mixture in the shells adding a small piece of butter to each, 
squeeze lemon juice over each, lay a thick coat of bread crumbs 
over all and bake. 

919. Lobster Patties. 

Articles. — A minced lobster, four tablespoonfuls of bech- 
amel sauce, six drops of anchovy sauce, lemon juice, and 
cayenne to taste ; the patties. 

Directions. — Line the patty pans with puff paste and put 
into each a small piece of bread, cover with paste, brush over 
with egg, and bake of a light color ; take as much lobster as is 
required, mince the meat very fine, add the sauces, lemon 
juice and cayenne to taste ; stir it over the fire about five 
minutes, remove the lids of the patty cases, take out the bread, 
fill with the mixture, replace the covers and serve. 

See Part I. for twenty-five more recipes for lobsters. 

920. A White Fricasse of Frogs. 

Cut off the hinder legs, strip them of the skin, and cut off 
the feet ; boil them tender in a little veal broth with whole 
pepper, a little salt, with a bunch of sweet herbs, and some 
lemon peel ; stew them with a shallot till the flesh is a little 
tender, strain off the liquor and thicken it with cream and 
butter ; serve them hot with mushrooms pickled and tossed up 
with the sauce. 

921. Frogs Fried. 

Put them in salted boiling water, with a little lemon juice? 
boil them three minutes, wipe them, dip them first into cracker 
dust, then in eggs, (half a cupful of milk mixed in two eggs 
and seasoned with pepper and salt) then again in cracker 
crumbs ; when they are all breaded, clean off the bone at the 
end with a dry cloth ; put them in a wire basket and dip them 
in boiling lard to fry ; place them on a hot planter in the form 
of a circle, one overlapping the other, with French peas in the 
center, and serve immediately while they are still crisp and hot. 



296 SHELL FISH. 



TERRAPINS, TURTLES AND TORTOISES. 
922. Terrapins. 

They must be boiled and picked; they are "diamond, 
backs, ' ' and sold in the markets by counts, which are so called 
from the width of the bottom shell, each count measuring three 
inches ; any terrapin that will go a count is a female, and is. 
preferred for being more tender, and on account of the eggs. 
Throw the terrapin into scalding water, with a little salt ; when 
boiled, after cooling, the under shell becomes detached ; the 
only things to be taken out of the terrapin are the gall and the 
sand bag, which are near together and about the center of it > 
the contents of the shell are broken up, and a small quantity of 
Madeira wine, pepper and salt added to the taste, and serve hot. 

Another method adopted by fishermen and hunters. — After 
being boiled the bottom shell is detached, gall and sand bag 
removed, the meat detached from the shell, broken up or 
minced, dressed with wine or brandy, or simply seasoned with 
salt and pepper, place a small piece of butter and some cracker 
or bread crumbs on top and bake in the shell. This is con- 
sidered by connoisseurs as the only way in which the full flavor 
of the terrapin can be obtained. 

923. Turtle or Tortoise, How to Roast. 

Take a piece of about five or six pounds, lay it in salt and 
water for two hours, then stick a few cloves in it and fasten it 
to the spit ; or lay it in the pan and place in your oven, baste 
it with wine and lemon juice, then dredge some flour over it 
with the raspings of bread sifted, and then baste it well either 
with oil or butter, strewing on from time to time, more flour 
and raspings, then take the liquor in the pan, and pouring off 
the fat, boil it with some lemon peel and a little sugar and salu 
pour it over the turtle and serve hot. 



CARVING. 297 



CARVING. 

One who is born with no mechanical genius should never 
torment himself or distract his family by attempting to carve 
at the table ; the office should be assumed by some one of the 
family more favored of the gods, who may, by daily practice 
and close attention, soon become a proficient in the art. Or 
it may be done in the kitchen before the repast and brought 
on the table at the proper time, and served by the host, or it 
may be served a la Russe — that is, by a servant passing the dish 
with the carved meat thereon to each guest. The arrangement 
of the meat on the plate, like that of flowers or dress, is a matter 
where taste is appreciated and usefully brought in. To save 
strength, time, and patience, a very sharp knife is an absolute 
necessity ; it is impossible to cut thin, beautiful slices without 
it ; as a general rule cut across the grain. 

POULTRY. 

If care is taken in picking and dressing fowls or birds, there 
is no need of washing them ; in France it is never done, unless 
there is absolutely something to wash off, then it is done as 
delicately as possible. 

Directions for selecting poultry will be found in Part i, 
page 19. 

924. Roast Turkey. 

The secret to have a good roast turkey is to baste it often 
and to cook it long enough. A small turkey of seven or eight 
pounds (the best selection if fat) should be roasted or baked 
about three hours ; a very large turkey will take four hours ; 
if properly basted they will not become dry ; after the turkey 
is dressed, season it well, sprinkling pepper and salt on. the 
inside ; stuff it, and tie it well in shape ; either lard the top or 
lay slices of bacon over it; wet the skin and sprinkle it well 
with pepper, salt, and flour ; pour a little water into the bottom 
of the dripping-pan. The excellence of the turkey depends 



298 POULTRY. 



much upon the frequency of basting it ; occasionally baste it 
with a little butter, oftener with its own drippings ; just before 
taking it out of the oven, put on more melted butter, this will 
make the skin more crisp and brown. While the turkey is 
cooking, boil the giblets well, chop them fine, and wash the 
liver, and when the turkey is done, put it on a hot platter ; 
put the dripping pan on the fire, dredge in a little flour, and 
when cooked stir in a little boiling water, add the giblets, and 
season with salt and pepper. If chestnut stuffing is used, add 
some boiled chestnuts to the gravy 3 besides the gravy always 
serve cranberry, currant or plum jelly with turkey; roast turkey 
is frequently garnished with little sausage balls. 

925. Stuffing for Roast Turkeys, Chickens, Ducks 
and Geese. 

That ordinarily used is made as follows : Two onions, five 
ounces of soaked and squeezed bread, eight sage leaves, one 
ounce of butter, pepper, salt, one egg, a little piece of pork 
minced. Mince the onions, and fry them before adding them 
to the other ingredients. Some chopped celery is always a 
good addition. 

926. Chestnut Stuffing 
Is made by adding chestnuts to the ordinary stuffing ; shell, 
and boil them in very salted water, remove the skin and add 
either whole, or minced, as you like ; some may also be added 

to the sauce. 

927. Oyster Stuffing 

Is made by adding about a quart of raw oysters to the ordinary 
stuffing ; the filling should be well seasoned, or the oysters will 

taste insipid. 

928. Boiled Turkey. 

If a boiled turkey is not well managed it will be quite taste- 
less ; choose a hen turkey ; if not well trussed and tied, the 
legs and wings of a boiled fowl will stick out in all directions ; 






GALANTINE OR BONED. 299 



•cut the legs at the first joint and draw them into the body, 
fasten the small ends of the wings under the back, and tie 
them securely with strong twine ; sprinkle over plenty of salt, 
pepper, and lemon juice, and put it into boiling water ; boil it 
slowly for two hours, or until quite tender ; it is generally 
served in a bed of rice, with oyster, caper, cauliflower, parsley 
or Hollandaise sauce ; pour part of the sauce over the turkey, 
reserve the giblets for giblet soup. It can be stuffed or not, 
the same as for roasting. 

929. Turkey Galantine, or Boned Turkey. 

Choose a fat hen turkey ; when dressing it leave the crop 
skin (the skin over the breast) whole, cut off the legs, wings 
and neck ; now slit the skin at the back, and carefully remove 
it all around ; cut out the breasts carefully and cut them into 
pieces about an inch square, season with pepper, salt, a little 
nutmeg, mace, pounded cloves, sweet basil, and a little chopped 
parsley, all mixed ; now make a forcemeat with a pound and a 
quarter of lean veal or fresh pork, well freed from skin and 
gristle - } mix this with the meat of the turkey, (all but the breasts) 
and chop it well ; then chop an equal volume of fresh bacon, 
which mix with the other chopped meat, season this with the 
condiments last mentioned and pound it in a mortar to a paste ; 
cut up one pound of truffles, half a pound of cooked pickled 
tongue, and half a pound of cooked fat bacon into small dice, 
seasoning them also ; spread the turkey skin on a board, make 
alternate layers on it, first of half of the forcemeat, then half of 
the turkey breasts, then half of the dice of tongue, truffles and 
bacon, then turkey fillets and dice again ; and save some of 
the forcemeat to put on the last layer ; now begin at one side 
and roll it over, giving it a round and long shape ; sew up the 
skin, wrap it, pressing it closely in a napkin ; tie it at the ex- 
tremities and also tie it across in two places, to keep it in an 
oval shape with round ends ; boil the galantine gently for four 
hours in boiling water (or better, in stock), with the bones of 



300 • POULTRY. 



the turkey thrown in ; at the end of that time take the stew pan 
off the fire and let the galantine cool in the liquor one hour, 
then drain it and put it on a dish with a weight on it ; when 
cold take the galantine out of the napkin, put it at the end of 
an open oven for a few minutes to melt the fat, which wipe off 
with a cloth, glaze it or sprinkle it with a little egg and fine 
bread crumbs and bake it a few minutes. It is, of course, to 
be sliced when eaten, and is generally served, placed on a 
wooden standard. 

930. A Simple way of Preparing Boned Turkey or 

Chicken. 

Boil a turkey or chicken in as little water as possible, until 
the bones can easily be separated from the meat ; remove all of 
the skin, slice and mix together the light and dark parts ;, 
season with pepper and salt ; boil down the liquid in which 
the turkey or chicken was boiled, and then pour it on the meat ; 
shape it like a loaf of bread, wrap it tightly in a cloth, and press 
it with a heavy weight for a few hours. When served it is cut 
into thin slices. 

CHICKENS. 

931. Spring Chickens, How to Improve. 

The excellence of spring chickens depends as much on feed- 
ing as on cooking them. If there are conveniences for building 
a coop, say five feet square, on the ground, where some spring 
chickens can be kept for a few weeks, feeding them with the 
scraps from the kitchen, and grain, they will be found plump, 
the meat white, and the flavor quite different from the t'hiri, 
poorly fed chickens just from the market. 

932. Spring Chickens Baked. 

Cut them open at the back, spread them out in a baking pan 
sprinkle on plenty of pepper, salt and a little flour ; baste them 
well with hot water which should be in the bottom of the pan, 
also at different times with a little butter; when done, rub 



BROILED CHICKEN. 301 



butter over them, as you would beefsteak, and set them in the 
oven for a moment before serving. 

933. Broiled Chicken. 

Cut it through the back, clean, wash and wipe it dry ; spread 
it on the gridiron, and cook slowly with the inside towards 
the fire, and keep it so until nearly done ; the chicken cooks more 
thoroughly in this way, and the surface being seared, the juice 
is retained ; it must be nicely browned on both sides, then 
served on a hot platter with a little butter, pepper and salt. 

934. Roasted and Boiled Chickens. 

Chickens are roasted and boiled the same as turkeys. A large 
tough chicken is very good boiled ; just before serving, pour 
over a good pickle or caper sauce ; of course the chicken should 
be put into boiling water and should not stop boiling until 
well done ; the water in which it has boiled should always be 
saved for soup ; the boiled chicken may be served on a platter 
and surrounded by a bed of boiled rice. 

935. Fricasseed Chicken. 

Articles. — Two chickens weighing about two and one-half 
pounds each, one and one-half ounces of flour, two ounces of 
butter, one pint of cold water, two gills of cream, one tea- 
spoonful of mace, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one-third of a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, one-third of a nutmeg grated, one 
onion, and the yolks of four eggs. 

Directions. — Cut the chickens and sprinkle the pieces with 
the salt, pepper and spices ; put the water in the kettle, and 
lay in the chicken, the skin side down ; slice the onion over 
them, cover closely, and let them simmer until done; take out 
the chicken, arrange it on the platter, and keep it hot, while 
the gravy is being thickened ; there should be nearly a pint of 
it; rub the butter and flour smoothly together, adding a little 
of the gravy to soften and help mix them ; stir it in the gravy, 



3°2 POULTRY. 



and let it boil two or three minutes ; pour in the cream, and 
as soon as it boils pour the whole on the well beaten yolks, 
return it to the saucepan, let it get thoroughly hot, without 
boiling, and pour it at once over the chickens. 

936. Chicken Croquettes. 

Articles. — Two chickens, two sets of brains, both boiled ;, 
one teacupful of suet, chopped fine ; two sprigs of parsley, 
chopped ; one nutmeg, grated ; an even tablespoonful of onion, 
after it has been chopped as fine as possible ; the juice and 
grated rind of one lemon, salt, and black and red pepper to taste. 

Directions. — Chop the meat very fine, mix all well together, 
add cream until it is quite moist or just right for moulding ; 
this quantity will make two dozen croquettes ; then mould them 
into shape, dip them into beaten egg, then roll them in pounded 
cracker and fry in boiling hot lard. 

DUCKS, GEESE AND GAME BIRDS. 

937. Roast Ducks. 

Truss and stuff them with onions as you would a goose ; if 
they are ducklings, roast them from twenty-five to thirty 
minutes ; epicures say they like them quite underdone, yet at 
the same time, very hot. Full-grown ducks should be roasted 
one hour, and frequently basted ; serve with them the brown 
giblet gravy or apple sauce, or both ; green peas should 
accompany the dish ; many parboil ducks before roasting or 
baking them ; if there is suspicion of advanced age, parboil them. 

938. Wild Ducks. 

They should be cooked rare, with or without stuffing ; baste 
them a few minutes at first with hot water, to which has been 
added one onion, and salt; then baste with butter, and a little 
flour to brown them ; the oven should be quite hot ; twenty to 
twenty-five minutes should cook them ; a brown gravy made 
with the giblets should be served with them. Currant jelly 



STEWED DUCK. 



3°3 



may also be served with them, and garnish the dish with slices 
of lemon. 

939. Stewed Duck. 

Cut the duck into joints ; put the giblets into a stew pan, 
adding water enough to cover them for the purpose of making 
a gravy ; add two onions, chopped fine ; two sprigs of parsley, 
three cloves, a sage leaf, pepper and salt ; let the gravy simmer 
until it is strong enough, then add the pieces of duck, cover, 
and let them stew slowly for two hours, adding a little boiling 
water when necessary ; just before they are done, add a small 
glassful of port wine, and a few drops of lemon juice ; put the 
duck on a warm platter, pour the gravy around, and serve with 
diamonds of fried bread placed around the dish. 

940. Roast Goose. 

The goose should be absolutely young ; green geese are best, 
i. e., when they are about four months old; in trussing, cut 
the neck close to the back, leaving the skin long enough to 
turn over the back ; beat the breast-bone flat with a rolling-pin, 
and tie the legs and wings securely ; stuff the goose with the 
following mixture : Four chopped onions, ten sage leaves, 
one-quarter of a pound of bread crumbs, one and one-half 
ounces of butter, salt and pepper to taste, one egg, and one 
slice of pork, chopped ; now sprinkle the top of the goose well 
with salt, pepper and flour ; if it be a green one, roast it one 
and one-half hours, if an older one it would be preferable to 
bake it in an oven, with plenty of hot water in the baking pan ; 
it should be basted very often with this water, and when it is 
nearly done baste it with butter and a little flour ; bake it three 
or four hours, decorate the goose with water cresses, and serve 
it with the brown giblet gravy in the sauce boat. Always serve 
an apple sauce with this dish. 

941. Goose Stuffing. (Soyer.) 

Take four apples peeled and cored, four onions, four leaves 



3°4 

of sage, and four of thyme ; boil them with sufficient water to 
cover them ; when clone, pulp them through a sieve, removing 
the sage and thyme, then add enough pulp of mealy potatoes 
to cause the stuffing to be sufficiently dry, without sticking to 
the hand ; add pepper and salt and then stuff the bird. 

942. Pigeons Stewed in Broth. 

Unless pigeons are quite young, they are better braised or 
stewed in broth than cooked in any other manner ; tie them 
in shape, place slices of bacon at the bottom of a stew pan, 
lay in the pigeons, side by side, their breasts uppermost ; add 
one sliced carrot, one onion with a clove stuck in, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, and some parsley, pour in enough stock to 
cover them ; if you have no stock use boiling water ; now 
place some thin slices of bacon over the tops of the pigeons, 
cover them as closely as possible, adding boiling water or 
stock when necessary ; let them simmer until very tender ; 
serve each pigeon on a thin slice of buttered toast, with a 
border of spinach, or make little nests of spinach on each piece 
of toast, and put a pigeon into each nest. 

943. Roast Pigeon. 

Never roast pigeons unless they are young and tender 5 after 
they are well tied in shape, drawing the skin over the back, 
tie thin slices of bacon over the breasts, and put a small piece 
of butter inside each pigeon ; place them in a pan, put into 
the oven, roast until thoroughly done, and baste well with butter- 

944. Broiled Pigeon. 

Split the pigeons at the back, and flatten them, season, roll 
them in melted butter, and bread crumbs, and broil them, 
basting them with butter ; or, cut out the breasts, and broil 
them alone ; serve them on thin slices of toast 3 make a gravy 
of the remaining portions of the pigeons and pour it over them. 

945. Prairie Chicken or Grouse, or Partridge. 

These are generally split open at the back and broiled, rubbing

BAKED QUAIL. 3O5 



them with butter, but as all but the breast is generally tough, 
it is better to fillet the chicken, or cut out the breast, and the 
remainder of the chicken is cut into joints and parboiled i 
these pieces are then broiled with the breasts, after rubbing 
butter over them all ; as soon as they are all broiled, sprinkle 
them with pepper and salt, and put a small piece of butter on 
top of each piece, which then place for a few moments in the 
•oven to soak the butter, and serve with currant jelly. For fine 
entertainments the breasts alone are served ; each breast is cut 
into two pieces, so that one chicken is sufficient for four per- 
sons ) if the dish is intended for breakfast, serve each piece on 
a small square of fried mush ; if for dinner, serve each piece 
on squares of buttered toast, with currant jelly on top of each 
piece of chicken, and garnish the plate with any kind of leaves, 
or with water cresses. 

946. Quails Parboiled and Baked. 

Tie a thin slice of bacon over the breast of each bird ; put 
the quails into a baking dish, with a little boiling water ; cover 
it closely, and set it on top of the range, letting the birds 
steam ten or fifteen minutes ; this plumps them ; then take off 
the cover and the pork, put the birds into the oven, basting 
them often with butter, brown them, and serve with currant jelly. 

947. Quails Roasted. 

Cover the breasts with very thin slices of bacon, or rub them 
well with butter, before placing them in the oven, basting them 
often with butter ; cook twenty minutes, and serve on a hot 
dish the moment they are taken from the oven, and sprinkle 
them with salt and pepper. 

948. Bread Sauce for Game. ( Mrs. Crane.) 

First roll one pint of dry bread crumbs, and pass half of 

them through a sieve ; put one small onion into one pint of 

milk, and when it boils remove the onion, and thicken the 

milk with the one-half pint of sifted crumbs ; take it from the 



W 



306 GAME, ETC. 



fire, and stir in one heaping teaspoonful of butter, a grating of 
nutmeg, pepper, and salt ; put a little butter into a frying pan> 
and when hot, throw in the one-half pint of coarser crumbs 
which remained ; stir them over the fire until they assume a. 
light brown color, taking care that they do not burn, and stir 
into them a small pinch of cayenne pepper ; they should be 
rather dry ; for serving, put a plump roast quail on a plate? 
pour over it a tablespoonful of the white sauce, on this place a. 
tablespoonful of the crumbs ; the sauce boat, and the plate of 
crumbs may be passed separately, or the host may arrange 
them at the table before the birds are passed. 

949. Scollops of Quails with Truffles. 

Remove the fillets or breasts of six quails, cut each fillet in 
two, and trim the parts to a round shape ; cook one-half of a 
pound of truffles in Madeira wine, and cut them into slices ; 
put the scollops of quail into a frying pan with some butter ; 
fry them until done, and mix with the truffles ; put a nice 
border on the dish, pile the center with the scollops and 
truffles, pour in some Espagnole or brown sauce, flavored with 
a little Madeira, and serve. Truffles can be procured canned. 

950. Snipe and Woodcock Fried. 

Dress and wipe them clean, tie the legs close to the body,, 
skin the heads and necks, and tie the beaks under the wings ;, 
tie also a very thin slice of bacon around the breast of each 
bird, and fry in boiling lard for five minutes ; season and serve 
on toast. 

951. Plovers 

Are cooked the same way as quails or partridges. 

VENISON. 

952. Roast Saddle of Venison. 

Make rather deep incisions, following the grain of the meat 
from the top, and insert pieces of pork about one-third of an. 



VENISON. 307 



inch square and one to one and one-half inches long, sprinkle 
over salt and a little flour, place in a hot oven for about two 
hours for an eight pound roast, baste often and serve with 
currant jelly. 

953. Broiled Venison Steak. 
Have the gridiron hot, broil and put on a hot dish, rub over 
them butter, pepper, salt and a little melted currant jelly ; some 
cooks add a tablespoonful of Madeira, sherry, or port wine to 
the melted currant jelly ; if one does not wish to serve the jelly, 
garnish simply with lemon slices. 

954. Stewed Venison. 

Cut it into steaks, spread over them a thin layer of stuffing 
made with bread crumbs, minced onion, parsley, pepper, salt, 
and a little pork chopped fine ; now roll them separately, and 
tie them each with a cord ; stew them in boiling water or stock, 
thicken the gravy with flour and butter mixed, and add one or 
two spoonfuls of sherry or port wine. 

RABBITS. 

955. Baked Rabbits. 

After they are skinned, dressed, and hung over night, put 
them into a baking pan, sprinkle over pepper, and salt, and 
put also a thin slice of bacon on the top of each rabbit ; now 
pour some boiling water into the bottom of the pan, and cover 
it with another pan of equal size, letting the rabbits steam 
fifteen or twenty minutes ; then take off the cover, baste them 
with a little butter and let them brown. Rabbits are much- 
improved by larding. 

956. Stewed Rabbits or Hasenpfeffer. (a la Mrs. Z>.) 

Skin, dress, and wash a rabbit nicely, cut into pieces, put- 
into a pan with a large tablespoonful of lard, fry it a light browrr 
on both sides, add salt and pepper to taste, one onion, four 
cloves of garlic, half a dozen sprigs of parsley, a little celery if 



;o8 MEATS. 



handy, cover with water and stew gently for two hours ; do 
not let the water boil down to less than one-half. About fifteen 
minutes before serving, add half a cupful of vinegar, (pure 
wine vinegar is preferable) the gravy may be thickened with a 
little flour if desired. This method of stewing a rabbit is much 
superior to the German style of preparing a Hasenpfeffer, 
namely : soaking the rabbit in spiced vinegar a few days, a 
process that renders the meat tasteless. 

MEATS. 

957. Roast Beef, 

To twelve pounds, or a " tenderloin roast," add one pint of 
water, one tablespoonful of salt, and one teaspoonful of pepper ; 
mix the salt and pepper, rub them well into the beef, lay it in 
the dripping pan with the water and roast two hours, basting 
it often ; when the beef is taken up, pour the fat from the 
dripping pan, and see that the gravy is well seasoned, put a 
few spoonfuls over the beef, and serve the rest in a gravy boat, 
thickened, if preferred, with browned flour. 

958. Beef a la Mode. 

Bone a round of beef, lard it with fat bacon, make several 
incisions, and fill them with a savory dressing of bread, in 
which there is a little chopped pork, and stuff it with the same, 
skewering it well together j tie it in good form with twine, put 
some pieces of pork in a pot, and when fried to a crisp take 
them out, lay in the beef and turn it until nicely browned all 
over ; then add hardly enough water to cover it, with a large 
onion, chopped, one sliced carrot, (several carrots may be used, 
with the addition of a little more water,) one dozen cloves, a 
small bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt ; cover closely and 
let it stew gently, but steadily for several hours, until very 
tender ; the water must boil down to make the gravy rich, but 
be careful that it does not burn ; it may be strained, and 
thickened with browned flour, or not, as preferred. 



TO BROIL BEEFSTEAK. 3O9 



959. To Broil a Beefsteak. 

It should be thick and tender ; lay it on a gridiron, before 
or over a clear coal fire, and as soon as seared, turn it and sear 
the other side, to prevent the escape of the juice ; if there is then 
danger of burning, the fire may be somewhat reduced by 
sprinkling ashes over it ; turn the steak often, and serve the 
moment it is cooked ; have the platter hot, and put small bits 
of butter, with a little pepper and salt over the steak ; this may 
be garnished with fried sliced potatoes, or with the steak placed 
in the center of the dish ; have browned potato balls, the size 
of a marble, in a pyramidal pile at each end. 

960. Another Method of Broiling Beefsteak. 

Put it on the gridiron before a clear fire ; have two ounces 
of butter (more, if the steak is large), with an even teaspoonful 
of salt, and one-half as much pepper, on the end of a hot 
platter ; when the steak is browned on one side, lay it on the 
platter and press the juice from it ; return it to the gridiron, 
mix the gravy, and when the beef is sufficiently cooked take it 
up, turn it two or three times in the gravy, wipe the edge of 
the platter and serve ; stewed mushrooms or tomatoes may be 
served with it if liked, or it may be garnished with shaved 
horse-radish ; when the steak is broiled, many prefer leaving it 
covered in the oven a few moments before serving, and many 
serve it without butter. 

961. Beefsteak Smothered in Onions. 

Cut six onions quite fine, and stew them in a saucepan with 
one pint of water, two ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of 
salt, and one-half as much of pepper, dredge in a little flour, 
stew until the onions are quite soft, then add a well-broiled 
beefsteak, let it simmer about ten minutes, and serve very hot. 

962. Beefsteaks for Extra Company. 

Use only the fillets, that is, the tender parts of the porter^ 



3IO MEATS. 



house or tenderloin steak ; cut in even shapes round or oval, 
and from one inch to one and one-half inches thick ; broil, 
and serve in individual dishes, surrounded with Saratoga or 
fried potatoes in any form, or with water cresses, or mushrooms, 
or stuffed tomatoes, or green peas. 

963. Beef Roll. (Cannelon de Bceitf.) 
Chop two pounds of lean beef very fine, chop and pound 
into a mortar one-half of a pound of fat bacon, and mix it with 
the beef; season it with pepper and salt, (it will not require 
much salt,) one small nutmeg, the grated rind of one lemon, 
the juice of one-quarter of it, one heaping tablespoonful of 
parsley, minced fine ; or, it can be seasoned with an additional 
tablespoonful of onion ; or, if no onion, or parsley, be at hand, 
with summer savory and thyme ; bind all these together with 
two eggs, form them into a roll, surround the roll with buttered 
paper, which tie securely around it, then cover it with paste 
made of flour and water, and bake two hours ; remove the 
paper and crust, and serve it hot with tomato sauce or brown 
gravy. 

964. Beef Croquettes. 
There is no more satisfactory manner of using cold cooked 
beef than for croquettes, which may be served with tomato or 
any of the brown sauces, or may be served without sauce at all, 
as is generally the case ; they are made in the same manner as 
is described for chicken croquettes, merely substituting the 
same amount of beef for the chicken, and of rice for the brains. 

VEAL. 

The best pieces of veal are the loin and the fillet, but a variety 
of dishes can be made with the cutlets and their different 
accompaniments ; it is always better cooked with pork or ham, 
and should always be thoroughly cooked. 

965. Roast of Veal. The Fillet. 

Take out the bone of the joint, make a deep incision 



VEAL ROAST. 3II 



"between the fillet and the flap ; then fill it with stuffing made as 
follows : two cupfuls of bread crumbs, one-half a cupful of 
chopped pork, one-half a lemon peel grated, a little juice of 
the lemon, thyme, and summer savory, or any herbs to taste ; 
bind the veal into a round form, fasten it with skewers and 
twine, sprinkle over pepper and salt, and cover it with buttered 
paper ; baste well and often ; just before it is done, remove 
the paper, sprinkle over a little flour, and rub it over with a 
little butter ; this will give a frothy appearance to the surface 
of the meat ; when done, add to the gravy in the pan a little 
flour, and boiling water, and, when cooked, some lemon juice ; 
strain it, remove the grease, and pour it around the roast, or 
serve in a gravy boat ; fry some pieces of ham cut in diamond 
shape, place these in a circle around the roast, each piece 
alternated with a slice of lemon. 

966. Fricatelle. (Mrs. £.) [Time.— One hour.] 
Articles. — Two pounds of lean veal, one large onion, six 
cloves of garlic, some parsley, two pounds of lean pork, five 
eggs, three-fourths cupful of flour, and salt and pepper to taste. 
Directions. — Chop both veal and pork very fine, mince the 
onion, garlic and parsley fine, add your seasoning to the meat 
and mix well ; mix the eggs with the mixture, and last the 
flour, kneading it well together ; place in shallow pans about 
one and one-half inches thick and bake about one hour ; serve 
cold, sliced and decorated with sprigs of parsley or chervil, 

967. Veal Cutlets Broiled. 

The rib cutlets should always be neatly trimmed, the bone 
scraped at the end, so that it will look smooth and white ; broil 
them on a moderate fire, basting them occasionally with butter, 
and turning them often ; dish them in a circle with tomato 
sauce. 

968. Sweetbreads, How to Prepare. 

Veal sweetbreads are the best, but spoil very soon, therefore 



312 



MEATS. 



the moment they come from the market they should be put 
into cold water to soak for about an hour, then lard them, or 
rather draw a lardoon of pork through the center and put them 
into salted boiling water and let them boil about twenty min- 
utes, or until they are thoroughly done ; throw them then into 
cold water for a moment only, and they will be firm and white y 
remove carefully the skin and little pipes and put the sweet- 
breads away in a cool place until ready to cook again ; the 
simplest and best way to cook them is as follows : 

969. Fried Sweetbreads. 

Take them prepared as above, cut them into even sized 
pieces, sprinkle with pepper and salt, egg and bread crumb 
4.hem and fry in hot lard ; they are often immersed in boiling 
lard, and yet oftener fried in a frying pan, if so, when done 
put them on a hot dish, turn out part of the lard from the 
frying pan, leaving about one-half a teaspoonful ; pour in a. 
cupful of milk, thickened with a little flour ; let it cook, stirring 
it constantly, season with salt and pepper, strain and pour 
over the sweetbreads. 

970. Sweetbreads with Tomatoes. 

Fry the prepared sweetbreads as above; stew either fresh- 
tomatoes in the usual manner, strain through a sieve and pour 
hot over the sweetbreads, of course omitting the white sauce 
mentioned in the recipe for fried sweetbreads. 

971. Vol-au-Vent of Sweetbreads and Oysters. 

Prepare three or four sweetbreads as indicated in recipe No- 
968 ; when cold cut into dice, salt, pepper and dredge them 
"with flour ; have in a basin two or three dozen stewed, drained 
oysters, a small teacupful of stewed button mushrooms, one 
'dozen or more olives, pared in one piece close to the kernel ; 
put one-quarter pound of butter in a stew pan, melt it, and add 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, stirring well and pouring in stock 
gradually until the sauce is of a creamy consistency, season 



FOURCHETTE. 



3*3 



with salt, pepper or cayenne, and add a very little grated nut- 
meg ; put in the sweetbreads, stirring to prevent browning > 
when thoroughly heated add one after the other, the oysters, 
mushrooms and olives, and a tablespoonful of wine vinegar ; 
stir and heat up again but do not let it boil ; serve in a vol-au- 
vent crust, after gently warming it. See recipe for vol-au-venf 

972. Fourchette. 

Articles. — Bits of nice salt pork about one-third of an incli 
thick and two or three inches square, and bits of calf liver the 
same size. 

Directions. — Put these alternately on a long skewer, be- 
ginning and ending with pork, lay it in the oven across a 
dripping pan, and roast as you would a bird, basting occasion- 
ally ; when done, slide the pieces from the skewer, and serve 
on a platter. 

973. Pork and Liver Brochette. (Madame Grimard. ) 

Articles. — Bits of nice salt pork about one-quarter inch thick 
and about one inch square, and bits of calf liver the same size. 

Directions. — Put these alternately on a long skewer, be- 
ginning and ending with pork, broil over a clear, hot fire till 
nicely done, and serve hot on the skewers. 

See Part I. for recipes for calves' head, feet and liver. 

MUTTON. 

The best roasts are the leg, the saddle and the shoulder, and 
are all roasted according to the regular rules of roasting ; they 
are also good braised. Currant jelly is usually served with the 
roast, and the dish may be garnished with stuffed potatoes. 

974. Boiled Leg of Mutton. 

This should be quite fresh ; put it into well-salted boiling 
water, which do not let stop boiling until the meat is thoroughly 
done ; the rule is to boil it one-quarter hour for each pound of 



314 MEATS. 



meat ; caper sauce should be served with this dish, either in a 
sauce boat or poured over the mutton, and garnished with 
parsley. 

975. Stuffed Leg of Mutton. 
Take out the bone and fill the cavity with a stuffing made 
of bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, a little summer 
savory, two ounces of salt pork chopped fine, and a bit of 
butter half the size of an egg ; skewer the ends, sprinkle the 
mutton with a teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful of 
pepper ; lay it in the dripping pan with a little water, and put 
it in a brisk oven ; when it begins to roast, put a little butter 
over it, and dredge it lightly with flour ; watch it very closely, 
keep an even heat and baste it thoroughly every fifteen minutes ; 
a piece weighing six pounds will roast in one and one-half hours. 

976. Mutton Cutlets. 

Trim them well, scraping the bones ; roll them in a little 
melted butter, or olive oil, season and broil them ; or they are 
nice, egged, bread crumbed and fried ; serve around a bed of 
mashed potatoes, which they help to season ; tomato sauce is 
also a favorite companion to the cutlets ; they can also be 
served with almost any kind of vegetables, peas or string beans 
placed in the center of the dish and the cutlets arranged in a 
circle around. 

977. Mutton Stew. [Time. — Two hours and a half.] 
Articles. — One and one-half pounds of mutton, two ounces 
of butter, one and one-half ounces of flour, one quart of boiling 
water, two teaspoonfuls of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, 
a pinch of summer savory, two onions with two cloves stuck 
in each, and turnips. 

Directions. — Cut the mutton into bits and fry in the butter 
about fifteen minutes, dredge over it the flour and let it brown ; 
add the boiling water, the salt, pepper, the onions cut in 
halves, cover closely and let simmer three-quarters of an hour; 



MUTTON STEW. 315 






form sixteen cork-shaped pieces of turnip with an apple corer, 
they should be of uniform length from two to three inches ; 
fry them brown in one ounce of butter, drop them in the stew, 
cover, and continue boiling one hour longer ; then drop in 
eight or ten potatoes, cut down to the size of a black walnut < 
when the potatoes are cooked, the stew is finished ; take out 
the onion, see that the gravy is well seasoned, pour the whole 
into a hot platter and serve. The bits of turnip and potato 
left from the cutting will do for soup, or with a little addition, 
may be cooked as vegetables. 

978. English Mutton Stew. 

Slice in thin small pieces, the cold roasted or boiled mutton 
left over from dinner, barely cover it with cold water, add 
pepper, salt and a small bit of butter, and let it simmer a few 
minutes ; thicken the gravy with a little flour and brown it 
with a browned flour ; add half a tumblerful of currant jelly 
and the same of port wine ; simmer a little longer and serve. 
This makes a very dark colored dish. 

979. Irish Stew. [Time — One hour and a half.] 

Articles. — Two pounds of sliced potatoes, two pounds of 
scrag mutton, two sliced onions, and seasoning to taste. 

Directions. — Cut the mutton into six or eight pieces, put 
into the stew pan and cover with one pint of cold water, add 
the potatoes and onions, let it come slowly to the boiling 
point, then skim well ; let it simmer one hour and a half, season 
to taste, and serve. 

980. Mutton Haricot. 

Trim mutton chops, but leave the bone ; brown them on 
both sides in a hot pan with a very little butter ; then drop 
them into boiling water deep enough to cover them, add two 
sliced carrots and let them stew until the carrots are tender ', 
while stewing, brown half a sliced onion in the pan where the 



316 SAUCES FOR MEATS. 



chops were fried, add to the carrots, and season with pepper 

and salt. 

LAMB. 

The best roasts are the fore and hind quarters, and the rules 
applying to veal will apply to lamb. 

981. Lamb Chops a la Royal. 

Trim them neatly, scrape the ends of the bones nicely, roll 
them in a little melted butter, and broil them carefully ; when 
done rub more butter over them, season them with pepper and 
salt, and slip little paper ruffles over the ends of the bones- 
They may be served with a center of almost any kind of vege- 
tables, a smooth mound of mashed potatoes, spinach, peas, 
beans, cauliflower, or stuffed baked tomatoes, or with a tomato 
sauce, and make a favorite company dinner dish. 

982. Lamb Croquettes 

Are made the same as chicken croquettes, only substituting 
cold cooked lamb for the chicken. Many prefer the lamb to 
the chicken croquettes, even for dinner or lunch parties. 

SAUCES FOR MEATS. 

The foundation of a large proportion of sauces is in what 
the French cook knows as a roux, and we as " drawn butter.' * 
As our drawn butter is often lumpy, or with the taste of the 
raw flour, we give the French method of preparing it. 

983. Roux or Drawn Butter Sauce. 

Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter the size of an egg, and 
add two even tablespoonfuls of sifted flour, one ounce of butter 
to two of flour being a safe rule ; stir till smooth and pour in 
slowly one pint of milk, or milk and water, or water alone • 
with milk it is called cream roux, and is used for boiled fish 
and poultry ; where the butter and flour are allowed to brown it 
is called a brown roux, and is thinned with the soup or stew 



SAUCES FOR MEATS. 317 



which it is designed to thicken ; and when made with the flour, 
butter and water only, it is called a white roux. 

984. Caper Sauce. 

Capers added to a white roux, which is the butter and flour 
with water added, as above, gives us a caper sauce. Pickled 
nasturtiums are a good substitute for capers. 

985. Pickle Sauce. 

Add two or three tablespoon fuls of pickles chopped or 
minced fine to a white roux, (see roux or ' ' drawn butter ' ' sauce.) 

986. Boiled Egg- Sauce. 

Add to half a pint of white roux, three hard boiled eggs, 
chopped, but not very fine. 

987. Anchovy Sauce. 

Add to half a pint of white roux two teaspoonfuls of anchovy 
extract or anchovy paste. 

988. Shrimp Sauce. 

To half a pint of white roux add half a can of shrimps, whole 
or chopped a little, let it simmer, not boil, a few minutes, and 
just before removing from the fire add a few drops of lemon 
juice and a very little cayenne pepper. Some add a teaspoonful 
of anchovy paste ; it is a matter of taste. 

989. Sauce Hollandaise or Dutch Sauce. 

This is one of the best sauces ever made for boiled fish, 
asparagus or cauliflower. Pour four tablespoon fills of wine 
vinegar into a small stew pan, add some pepper corns and salt ; 
let the liquid boil until it is reduced one half, let it cool, then 
add to it the well beaten yolks of four or five eggs, also four 
ounces (the size of an egg) of good butter, more salt, if 
necessary, and a very little nutmeg ; set the stew pan on a very 
slow fire, and stir the liquid until it is about as thick as cream, 
and immediately remove it ; now put this cup or stew pan into 



318 SAUCES FOR MEATS. 



another pan containing a little warm water kept at the side of 
the fire ; work the sauce briskly with a spoon or a little whisk, 
o as to get it frothy, but adding little bits of butter, in all 
about three ounces, (say about the size of half an egg) \ when 
the sauce has become light and smooth it is ready for use. 

990. Mushroom Sauce. 

Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut, into a small stew 
pan or tin basin, and when it bubbles add a teaspoonful of 
flour (not heaping); when well cooked stir in a cupful of stock, 
(reduced and strong,) and half a teacupful of the mushroom 
juice from the can ; let it simmer for a minute or two, then 
after straining it, add half or three-quarters of a can of mush- 
rooms, pepper, salt, and a few drops of lemon juice, and when 
thoroughly hot it is ready to pour over the meat. 

991. Sauce aux Fines Herbes. 

Articles. — Half a pint of good stock, three tablespoonfuls 
of mushrooms, one tablespoonful of onion, two of parsley, and 
one shallot all chopped fine. 

Directions. — Fry the shallot and onion in a little butter 
until they assume a light yellow color, then add a teaspoonful 
of flour and cook it a minute, stir in the stock, mushrooms and 
parsley, simmer for five minutes, then add a little Worcester- 
shire or lime juice sauce, and salt to taste. 

992. Bechamel Sauce. 

Put butter the size of a walnut into a stew pan, and when it 
bubbles stir in an even tablespoonful of flour, which cook 
thoroughly without letting it take color ; mix into this a cupful 
of strong veal broth (t. e. veal put into cold water and boiled 
four or five hours) add next a cupful of boiling cream and one 
grating of nutmeg, let it simmer, stirring it well for a few 
minutes, then strain and it is ready for use. The sauce would 
be improved if the usual soup bunch of vegetables were added 
to the stock while it is being made. 



SAUCES FOR MEATS. . 319 



993. A Simple Brown Sauce, (Sauce Espagnol.)

1000. Potatoes a la Neige. 

Take mashed potatoes prepared in the usual manner, press 
through a colander into the dish they are to be served in, they 
will then resemble rice or vermicelli ; they will be very light 
and nice and make a pretty dish, but must be served very hot. 
This makes a favorite accompaniment to venison and is often 
served around a rolled rib roast of beef. 

1001. Saratoga Potatoes.

the frying pan as soon as they are brown with a perforated 
skimmer, put into a colander and shake for an instant. They 
should be crisp and free from grease. 

1002. Baked Tomatoes. (Mrs. M. Westerhold.) [Time.— 

Half an hour.] 

Articles. — Large, smooth tomatoes, bread crumbs, and salt 
pork 

Directions. — Take large, smooth tomatoes, wipe them and 
cut a thin slice from the blossom end, take out the seeds and 
fill each tomato with a forcemeat made of bread crumbs, some 
salt pork, chopped very fine, seasoning well with salt and 
pepper, put a bit of butter in each, fit on the top, place them 
in a deep dish and bake about half an hour. 

1003. Asparagus on Toast. ["Time. — Half an hour.] 
Articles. — asparagus, salt, butter, and toasted bread. 
Directions. — Tie the stalks in small bunches, boil them in a 

very little salted water about half an hour, toast as many slices 
of bread as there are bunches of asparagus, lay a bunch on 
each slice, add butter to the water sufficient to make a rich 
gravy, thicken with a little flour, season with pepper, pour over 
the asparagus and serve. 

1004. Oyster Plants Stewed.

into boiling water, in which you have placed one-half tea- 
spoonfui of salt and one-third teaspoonful of sugar to one quart 
of water ; when done, drain, and mix them with white sauce,

either drawn butter or a simple bechamel sauce at pleasure*' 

1005. Cauliflower with White Sauce. 

Trim off the outside leaves, and put the cauliflower into well 

salted boiling water ; be careful to take it out as soon as tender/ 

to prevent it dropping into pieces ; make in a saucepan a white 

sauce as follows : put butter the size of an egg into a saucepan 

and when it bubbles stir in a scant half teacupful of flour, stir 

with an egg whisk until cooked, then add two teacupfuls of 

thin cream, some pepper and salt, stir it over the fire until 

perfectly smooth, pour the sauce over the cauliflower, and 

serve. Many let the cauliflower simmer in the sauce a few 

moments before serving. The sauce Hollandaise is very fine for 

cauliflower. 

1006. Spinach. 

Having washed it thoroughly put it into just enough salted 
boiling water to cover it ; when it is tender, squeeze out all 
the water, and press it through a colander ; then fry it for a 
few minutes, with a little butter, pepper and salt ; serve with 
sliced hard boiled eggs on top ; or, if used for a garnish for 
lamb, add a little lemon juice and a spoonful of stock ; or, it 
is nice served as a course by itself, arranged as follows : put a 
circle of thin slices of buttered toast (one slice for each person 
a t the table) around the dish, and on each slice put a cupful of 
spinach, neatly smoothed into shape ; press the half of a hard 
boiled egg into the top of each pile of spinach, leaving the cut. 
part of the egg uppermost. 

1007. Beets. 

If they are winter beets, soak them over night, in any case 
be careful not to prick or cut the skin before boiling, as they 
will lose their color, put them into boiling water and boil 
until tender ; if they are served hot, pour a little melted butter, 
pepper and salt over them ; they may be served cold, cut into 
slices with some vinegar over them, or cut into little dice and

mixed with other cold vegetables for a winter salad, if desired. 
1008. Artichokes. 

Cut off the outside tough leaves and trim the bottom, throw 
them into boiling salted water, with a few drops of vinegar; 
when quite done, drain and serve with drawn butter, or still 
better with sauce Hollandaise. 

1009. To Cook Cranberries. 

Add one teacupful of water to a quart of cranberries, and 
put them over the fire ; after cooking ten minutes add two 
heaping cupfuls of sugar, and cook about ten minutes longer, 
stirring them often : pour them into a bowl or mould, and 
when cold they can be removed as a jelly ; the berries will 
seem very dry before the sugar is added, but if more water is 
used they will not form a jelly. 

^OMELETS. 

Part I. contains many recipes for plain and fancy omelets 5 
we add a few more. 

10-0. Omelets with Mushrooms. 

Boil the mushrooms in a little water or stock, to which add 
pepper, salt, a few drops of lemon juice and a little flour to 
thicken it slightly ; make the plain omelet and just before 
turning one half over the other, place part of the mushrooms - 
in the center ; when the omelet is turned, of course the mush- 
rooms will be quite enveloped ; when you serve it pour the-' 
remainder of the mushrooms around it with the juice. 

ion. Omelets with Shrimps, 

Inclose some canned shrimps in the center of the omelet, 
same as you have the mushrooms, and garnish the omelets 
with shrimps around it in the dish. 

1012. Omelets with Oysters. 

Scald the ovsters in their own liquor ; when just about to 



;24 OMELETS. 



boil, plump them by throwing them into cold water, and beat 
them into the eggs before cooking your omelet, leaving a few 
oysters out to garnish the plate. 

1013. Sweet Omelet for Dessert. 

Add a little sugar to the eggs, instead of pepper and salt, 
make it then as a plain omelet, enclosing in the center any 
kind of preserves, marmalade or jam ; when it is turned upon the 
dish sprinkle sugar on the top. 

1014. Omelet with Rum. 

Add a little sugar to the eggs, say a sherry glassful to six 
eggs and make as a plain omelet ; when turned upon the dish 
sprinkle a little handful of sugar over the top and pour five or 
six tablespoonfuls of Jamaica or Santa Cruz rum over it, set 
it on fire and serve it at the table burning. 

1015. Omelet Souffle. 

Articles. — Six whites and three yolks of eggs, three ounces 
of pulverized sugar or three tablespoonfuls, and vanilla or 
lemon flavoring. 

Directions. — Beat the yolks and sugar to a light cream and 
add the flavoring — only a few drops 3 then beat the whites into 
the stiffest possible frost, have the yolks in a deep bowl, turn 
the whites over them, and with a spoon, giving it a rotary 
motion, cut the two, mixing them carefully together 3 turn this 
upon a baking dish, either of earthen or tin, with sides two or 
three inches high and slightly buttered ; smooth over the top, 
sprinkle over sugar and put it into a moderate oven. If it has 
to be turned or moved in the oven, do it as gently as possible. 
When it has risen well and is of a fine yellow color, it is ready 
to be served, and should be served at once, or it might fall. 

SALADS. 

A Frenchman thinks he cannot eat his dinner without his 
?alad. It would be. well if every one had the same appreciation 



SALADS. 



of this most wholesome, refreshing, and at the same time, most 
economical dish. It is an accomplishment to know how to 
dress a salad well, which is especially prized by the fashionable 
world. The materials used for salads are generally those shown 
in the following list : 

Lettuce, Onions, .Cold boiled potatoes, 

Celery, Garlic, Cabbage, 

Endive, Radishes, Cives, 

Garden-cress, Beet-root, Tarragon, 

Sorrel, Pepper-grass, Nasturtium blossoms ; 

or salads of mixed vegetables (salades en macedoine), selected 
from this list of vegetables : 

Cold boiled potatoes, Olives, Cucumbers, 

String beans, Tomatoes, Carrots, 

Navy-beans, Pease, Truffles, 

Lima beans, Cauliflower, Turnips. 

Beet-root, Asparagus-tops, 

Salads are also made of cold boiled fowls or fish, as follows : 

Chickens, Salmon, Shrimps, 

Lobster, Prawns, Sardines. 

There are two kinds of dressing which are the best and oft- 
enest used : the Mayonnaise and the French dressing. Epicures 
prefer the simple French dressing for salads served without fish 
or fowl. For chicken and fish salads, and some vegetables, as 
tomatoes and cauliflowers, they use the Mayonnaise sauce. This 
arrangement of dressings is almost universal in London and 
Paris. In America we use the Mayonnaise for all salads. The 
simple salad with the French dressing is, after all, the most • 
refreshing and satisfactory, if one has a heavy dinner served 
before it. The recipes are as follows : 

1016. Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Put the uncooked yolk of an egg into a cold bowl; beat it 
well with a silver fork ; then add two saltspoonfuls of salt, and 
one saltspoonful of mustard powder ; work them well a minute 



SALADS. 



before adding the oil ; then mix in a little good oil, which 
must be poured in very slowly (a few drops at a time) at first, 
alternated occasionally with a few drops of vinegar. In pro- 
portion as the oil is used, the sauce should gain consistency. 
When it begins to have the appearance of jelly, alternate a few 
drops of lemon juice with the oil. When the egg has absorbed 
a gill of oil, finish the sauce by adding a very little pinch of 
cayenne pepper, and one and a half teaspoonfuls of good vin- 
egar ; taste it to see that there are salt, mustard, cayenne, and 
vinegar enough. If not, add more very carefully. These pro- 
portions will suit most tastes ; yet some like more mustard and 
more oil. Be cautious not to use too much cayenne. 

By beating the egg a minute before adding the oil, there'is 
little danger of the sauce curdling ; yet if, by adding too much 
oil at first, it should possibly curdle, immediately interrupt the 
operation. Put the yolks of one or two eggs on another plate ; 
beat them well, and add the curdled Mayonnaise by degrees, 
and finish by adding more oil, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and 
cayenne according to taste. If lemons are not at hand, many 
use vinegar instead. 

1017. Red Mayonnaise Sauce. 

Pound some lobster coral, pass it through a sieve, and mix 
it with the Mayonnaise sauce. 

1018. French Dressing. 

Articles. — One tablespoonful of vinegar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil, one saltspoonful of pepper, one saltspoonful 
of salt, and one even teaspoonful of onion scraped fine. 

Directions. — Pour the oil, mixed with the pepper. and salt, 
over the salad ; mix them together, then add the vinegar and 
mix again. Many different combinations can be made to suit 
the fancy, from the list of salad materials. We give certain 
combinations oftenest seen. It must be remembered that salad 
is never good unless perfectly fresh. It should not be mixed,

or brought into the dining-room, until the moment when it is 
to be eaten. When preparing lettuce salad, choose the crisp, 
tender, center leaves of head lettuce. 

COMBINATIONS. 

10x9. Lettuce (French Cook). 

Rub garlic in the dish in which lettuce, with French dressing 
(without onion), is to be served. Leave no pieces of the garlic 
— merely rubbing the dish will give flavor enough. The French 
often use garlic in salads. We would advise, however, the use 
of the simple French dressing with onion to be mixed with the 
lettuce leaves, and dispense with the garlic. Use plain vinegar. 
Nasturtium blossoms have a most pleasant, piquant flavor, and 
make a beautiful garnish for a salad. 

2. Lettuce, with water-cresses or pepper-grass mixed, and 
small radishes placed around for a garnish. French or Mayon- 
naise dressing. 

3. Lettuce, with cives mixed, and olives placed around for 
garnish. French dressing. 

4. Lettuce, with celery mixed (most excellent). Cut the 
celery into pieces, an inch and a half long ; then slice these 
lengthwise into four or five pieces. Mix with lettuce. French 
dressing. 

5. Lettuce and sorrel mixed. French dressing. 

6. Lettuce, with anchovies (cut into thin strips as celery) 
and chopped cives. To vary this dish, prawns and shrimps 
are used for a garnish; or the anchovies may be left out. 
French dressing. 

7. Endive alone. French dressing. 

8. Endive, mixed with water-cress. French dressing. 

9. Endive, with celery, beets, and hard-boiled eggs in 
slices.. French dressing. Endive in center, row of eggs 



328 COMBINATION SALADS. 

around, then row of beets, then an edge of fringed celery. 

10. Water-cress is good mixed with cold boiled beets. Cut 
the beets into little dice ; garnish with olives. French dressing. 

11. Lettuce and dice of cold boiled potatoes, and cold 
boiled beets. Potatoes piled in the center, beets next, and 
lettuce around the edge of the dish. French dressing. 

1020. Potato Salad. 

New small onions sliced, mixed with cold boiled potatoes 
cut into dice. French dressing. This potato salad is very nice. 

Another way is to rub the dish with garlic in which the salad 
is made. Mix chopped parsley with the potatoes cut into dice. 
French dressing. 

1. Sliced cucumbers, and sliced new onions. French 
dressing. 

2. Cabbage alone, with French or Mayonnaise dressing. 

1021. Cold Slaw. 

Cut the cabbage not too fine ; sprinkle pepper and salt over 
it, and set it on ice, or in a cool place, to keep it crisp. 

Dressing. — Beat the yolks of three eggs, or the whole of 
two eggs, with five tablespoonfuls of good strong vinegar, two 
heaping teaspoonfuls of sugar (three, if the vinegar is very 
strong), half a teaspoonful of made mustard, and butter size of 
an almond. Put these ingredients into a tin cup, and stir them 
over the fire until they are about to boil, or until they become 
a smooth paste. Put the mixture one side to become cold, and 
to remain until just before it is wanted at table; then mix it 
well with the cold cabbage, and garnish the top with slices of 
hard-boiled egg. 

Cold slaw is especially nice served with fried oysters. Place 
it in the center of the warm platter on a folded napkin (a too 
warm platter would injure it), then make a circle of fried oys- 
ters around it. This makes a nice course for dinner. 

The salads of vegetables are generally better with the French 



SALADS. 329 



dressing. They present a better appearance by cutting them 
with a small vegetable-cutter. 

1022. Salad of Vegetables (Salade de Legumes). 

Mix cold boiled pease, string-beans, pieces of cauliflower, 
asparagus tops, or almost any one of the small vegetables ; do 
not cut the larger ones too fine. French dressing. 

2. Cold boiled potatoes, lima beans, beets, and carrots. 
French dressing. 

3. Cold baked navv beans, with Mayonnaise sauce. 

1023. Mayonnaise of Cauliflower. 

Place some cauliflowers into just enough boiling water to 
cover them ; add a little salt and butter to the water. When 
cooked, let them become cold ; then season them with a mari- 
nade of a little salt and pepper, three spoonfuls' of vinegar, 
and one spoonful of oil. Let them then remain for an hour. 
When ready to serve, pile them on the dish to a point ; then 
mask them with a Mayonnaise sauce. 

1024. Tomatoes a la Mayonnaise. 

This is a truly delicious dish ; it would,, in fact, be good 
every day during the tomato season. 

Select large, fine tomatoes and place them in the ice-chest ; 
the colder they are, the better, if not frozen ; skin them without 
the use of hot water, and slice them, still retaining the form of 
the whole tomato. Arrange them in uniform order on a dish, 
with a spoonful of Mayonnaise sauce thick as a jelly on the top 
of each tomato. Garnish the dish with leaves of any kind. 
Parsley is very pretty. 

Some marinate the tomato slices, i. e., dip them into a mix- 
ture of three spoonfuls of vinegar to one spoonful of oil, pepper, 
and salt; and then, after draining well, mix them in the May- 
onnaise sauce.

SALADS. 



1025. String Beans in Salad (French Cook). 

String the beans and boil them whole ; when boiled tender, 
and they have become cold, slice them lengthwise, cutting each 
bean into four long slices ; place them neatly, the slices all 
lying in one direction, crosswise on a platter. Season them 
an hour or two before serving, with a marinade of a little 
pepper, salt, and three spoonfuls of vinegar to one spoonful of 
oil. Just before serving, drain from them any drops that may 
have collected, and carefully mix them with a French dressing. 
This makes a delicious salad. 

1026. Chicken Salad. 

Boil a young, tender chicken, and when cold separate the 
meat from the bones ; cut it into little square blocks or dice ; 
do not mince it. Cut white tender stalks of celery into about 
three-quarter inch lengths, saving the outside green stalks for 
soups ; mix the chicken and celery together ; and then stir well 
into them a mixture in the proportion of three tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar to one tablespoonful of oil, with pepper, salt, and a 
little mustard to taste. Put this aside for an hour or two, or 
until just before serving ; this is called marinating the chicken ; 
it will absorb the vinegar, etc. When about to serve, mix the 
celery and chicken with a' Mayonnaise sauce, leaving a portion 
of the sauce to mask the top. Reserve several fresh ends or 
leaves of celery with which to garnish the dish. Stick a little 
bouquet of these tops in the center of the salad, then a row of 
them around it. From the center to each of the four sides 
sprinkle rows of capers. Sometimes slices or little cut diamonds 
of hard-boiled eggs are used for garnishing. 

Chicken salad is often made with lettuce instead of celery. 
Marinate the chicken alone ; add it to the small tender leaves 
(uncut) of the lettuce the last moment before serving ; then 
pour Mayomiaise dressing over the top. Garnish with little 
center-heads of lettuce, capers, cold chopped red beets if you 



SALADS. 33 1 

choose, or sliced hard boiled eggs. Sometimes little strips of 
anchovy are added for a garnish. When on the table it should 
all be mixed together. Many may profit by this recipe for 
chicken salad ; for it is astonishing how few understand making 
so common a dish. It is generally minced, and mixed with 
hard-boiled eggs, etc., for a dressing. 

1027. Chicken Salad. (Careme's Recipe.) 
Take some tender pullets ; fry them in the saute pan, or 
roast them ; when cold, cut them up, skinning and trimming 
them neatly. Put the pieces into a tureen, with some salt, 
pepper, oil, vinegar, some sprigs of parsley, and an onion cut 
into slices ; mix all well together ; cover, and let stand for 
some hours ; then, just before serving, drain the salad, taking 
care to remove all bits of onion, etc., and place it tastefully on 
lettuce leaves, with the hearts of the lettuce on top, and cover 
with a Mayonnaise dressing. 

1028. Mayonnaise of Salmon. 

Remove the skin and bones from a piece of salmon, boiled 
and cooled, and cut it into pieces two inches long. Marinate 
them, i. e., place them in a dish, and season them with salt, 
pepper, a little oil, and, in this case, plenty of vinegar, some 
parsley, and a little onion cut up ; then cover, and let them 
stand two or three hours. In the mean time, cut up some hard 
boiled eggs into four or eight pieces for a border. Cover the 
bottom of the salad dish with lettuce leaves, seasoned with a 
French dressing ; place your salmon slices in a ring on the 
lettuce, pouring in the center a Mayonnaise sauce. Sprinkle 
capers over the whole. 

Other kinds of fish, such as pike, blue-fish, and flounders, 
make very good salads, arranged in the same way. Careme, 
Gouffe, and Francatelli fry their fish and fowl in a saute pan, 
instead of boiling them. If you do not make use of remnants 
of salmon left from the table, you can form better-shaped slices

by cutting the fish into little shapes before it is boiled. If you 
wish to boil them, immerse them in warm water (with vinegar 
and salt added) in a wire basket, or drainer.

tard, one of salt and two eggs.

fire, stirring constantly until the mixture has become thick 
then remove from the fire, and continue stirring until smooth. 

1033. Lobster Salad with Cream Dressing. 

Articles. — One fine lobster, boiled, and when cold picked 
to pieces., or two small lobsters, one cup best salad oil, one- 
half cup sweet cream, whipped light to a cupful of froth, one 
lemon — the juice strained, one teaspoonful of mustard wet up 
with vinegar, one tablespoonful powdered sugar, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, four tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, and the beaten yolks of two eggs. 

irections. — Beat the eggs, sugar, salt, mustard, and pepper 
until light, then add very gradually the oil ; when the mixture 
is quite thick, whip in the lemon, and beat five minutes before 
putting in the vinegar; just before the salad goes to the table 
add half the whipped cream to this dressing and stir well into 
the lobster ; line the salad bowl with lettuce leaves, put in ihe 
seasoned meat and cover with the rest of the whipped cream. 
Lobster salad should be eaten as soon as possible after the 
dressing is added. If you use canned lobster, open, and turn 
out the contents into a crockery dish several hours before you 
mix the dressing, that the close airless smell may pass away.

1 145. Punch. 

To make punch of any sort in perfection the ambrosial 
essence of the lemon must be extracted by rubbing lumps of 
sugar on the rind, which breaks the delicate little vessels that 
contain the essence, and at the same time absorbs it. This, 
and making the mixture sweet and strong, using tea instead of 
water, and thoroughly amalgamating all the -compounds, so 
that the taste of neither the bitter, the sweet, the spirit, nor 
the element, shall be perceptible one over the other, is the 
grand secret, only to be acquired by practice. 

In making hot toddy, or hot punch, you must put in the 
spirits before the water ; "in cold punch, grog, etc., the other way. 

The precise portions of spirit and water, or even of the 
acidity and sweetness, can have no general rule, as scarcely 
two persons make punch alike. 

1146. Brandy Punch. 

(Use large glass.) 

One tablespoonful of raspberry syrup, two tablespoonfuls of 
white sugar, one wineglassful of water, one and one-half wine- 
glassfuls of brandy, one-half of a small-sized lemon, two slices 
of orange, and one piece of pine-apple. 

Fill the tumbler with shaved ice, shake well, and dress the 
top with berries in season ; sip through a straw. 

1147. Brandy Punch. 

(For a party of twenty.) 

One gallon of water, three quarts of brandy, one-half of a 
pint of Jamaica rum, two pounds of sugar, the juice of six 
lemons, three oranges sliced, one pine-apple, pared and cut 
up, one gill of Curagoa, two gills of raspberry syrup, ice, and 
add berries in season. 

Mix the materials well together in a large bowl, and you 
have a splendid punch.

half a wineglassful of water, one and one-half tablespoonfuls

a tumbler with shaved ice. 

The above must be well shaken, and to those who like their

water, stir well together ; add the rum, brandy and nutmeg ; 
mix thoroughly, and the punch will be ready to serve. As we 
have before said, it is very important, in making good punch, 
that all the ingredients are thoroughly incorporated ; and, to 
insure success, the process of mixing must be diligently at- 
tended to. Allow a quart for four persons ; but this informa- 
tion must be taken cum grano salts; for the capacities of persons 
for this kind of beverage are generally supposed Jo vary con- 
siderably. 

1150. Irish Whiskey Punch.

one-third pure whiskey and two-thirds boiling water, in which the

whis>*»y is poured in.

One dozen eggs, two quarts of brandy, one pint of Santa 
Cruz rum, two gallons of milk, and one and one-half pounds 
of white sugar. 

Separate the whites of the eggs from the yolks, beat them 
separately with an egg-beater until the yolks are well cut up, 
and the whites assume a light fleecy appearance. Mix all the

One tablespoonful of white sugar, one egg, and two wine- 
glassfuls of sherry. 

Dissolve the sugar with a little water, break the yolk of the

add one and a half wineglassfuls of Cognac brandy, and fill the 
glass with fine shaved ice, then draw out the sprigs of mint and 
insert them in the ice with the stems downward, so that th e 
leaves will be above, in the shape of a bouquet ; arrange berries?

and small pieces of sliced orange on top- in a tasty manner, 
dash with Jamaica rum, and sprinkle white sugar on top. Place 
a straw across the top, and you have a julep that is fit for an 
emperor. 

1 174. Brandy Smash. 

(Use small glass.) 

One-half of a tablespoonful of white sugar, one tablespoonful 
of water, and one winegiassful of brandy. 

Fill two-thirds full of shaved ice, use two sprigs of mint, the 
same as in the recipe for mint julep. Lay two small pieces of 
orange on top, and ornament with berries in season. For gin 
or whiskey smash, take whiskey or gin. 

1 175. Sherry Cobbler. 

(Use large glass.) 

Two wineglassfuls of sherry, one tablespoonful of sugar, and 
two or three slices of orange. 

Fill a tumbler with shaved ice, shake well, and ornament

FANCY BEVERAGES. 377 



Squeeze lemon peel ; fill one-third full of ice, and stir with 
a spoon. 

1179. Mulled Wine with Eggs. 

One quart of wine, one pint of water, one tablespoonful of 
allspice, and nutmeg to taste ; boil them together a few 
minutes ; beat up six eggs with sugar to your t.aste \ pour the 
boiling wine on the eggs, stirring it all the time. Be careful not 
to pour the eggs into the wine, or they will curdle. 

1 180. Port Wine Sangaree. 

(Use small glass.) 

One and a half wineglassfuls of port wine, one teaspoonful of 
sugar, fill the tumbler two-thirds with ice, shake well and grate 
nutmeg on top. 

1181. Egg Flip. 

Put a quart of ale in a tinned saucepan on the fire to boil ; 
in the mean time, beat up the yolks of four, with the whites of 
two eggs, adding four tablespoonfuls of brown sugar and a 
little nutmeg ; pour on the ale by degrees, beating up, so as to 
prevent the mixture from curdling ; then pour back and for- 
ward repeatedly from vessel to vessel, raising the hand to as 
great a height as possible — which process produces the smooth- 
ness and frothing essential to the good quality of the flip. This 
is excellent for a cold, and, from its fleecy appearance,, is 
sometimes designated "a yard of flannel." 

1 182. Crimean Cup, a la Marmora. 

(From a recipe by the celebrated Soyer.) 
( For a party of thirty. ) 

One quart of syrup of orgeat, one pint of Cognac brandy, 
one-half of a pint of maraschino, one-half of a pint of Jamaica 
rum, two bottles of champagne, two bottles of soda-water, six 
ounces of sugar, and four middling-sized lemons. 

Thinly peel the lemons, and place the rind in a bowl with 
the sugar, macerate them well for a minute or two, in order to 
extract the flavor from the lemon. Next squeeze the juice of 



378 FANCY BEVERAGES. 



the lemons upon this, add two bottles of soda-water, and stir 
well till the sugar is dissolved ; pour in the syrup of orgeat, 
and whip the mixture well with an egg-whisk, in order to 
whiten the composition. Then add the brandy, rum and 
maraschino, strain the whole into the punch-bowl, and just 
before serving add the champagne, which should be well iced. 
While adding the champagne, stir well with the ladle ; this will 
render the cup creamy and mellow. 

1 183. Tom and Jerry. 

(Use punch-bowl for the mixture.) 

Five pounds of sugar, twelve eggs, one-half of a small glassful 
of Jamaica rum, one and one-half teaspoonfuls of ground cin- 
namon, one-half of a teaspoonful of ground cloves, and one-half 
of a teaspoonful of ground allspice. 

Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and the yolks 
until they are as thin as water, then mix together and add the 
spice and rum, thicken with sugar until the mixture attains the 
consistence of a light batter. 

To deal out Tom and Jerry. — Take a small bar glass, and to 
•one tablespoonful of the above mixture, add one wineglassful 
of brandy, and fill the glass with boiling water, and grate a 
little nutmeg on top. Adepts in serving Tom and Jerry, 
sometimes -adopt a mixture of one-half brandy, one-quarter 
Jamaica rum, and one-quarter Santa Cruz rum, instead of 
brandy plain. This compound is usually mixed and kept in a 
bottle, and a wineglassful is used to each tumbler of Tom and 
Jerry. 

N. B. — A teaspoonful of cream of tartar, or about as much 
carbonate of soda as you can get on a dime, will prevent the 
sugar from settling to the bottom of the mixture. This drink 
is sometimes called Copenhagen, and sometimes Jerry Thomas. 



COMPANY DINNERS. 379 



1184. TO PREPARE COMPANY DINNERS. 

It is v»ry simple to prepare a dinner served a la Russe, as it 
matters little how many i; courses there may be. If it were 
necessary to prepare many dishes, and to have them all hot 
and in perfection at the same minute, and then be obliged to 
serve them nearly all together, the task might be considered 
rather formidable and confusing. But with one or two assist- 
ants, and with time between each course to prepare the suc- 
ceeding one, after a very little practice it becomes a mere 
amusement. 

The soup, or the stock for the soup, and the dessert, should 
be made the day before the dinner. 

A bill of fare should be written, and pinned up in the kitchen. 
Everything should be prepared that is possible in the early 
part of the day; then, after the fish, chickens, birds, etc., are 
dressed and larded (if necessary), they should be put aside, 
near the ice. If sweet-breads are to be served, they should be 
larded, parboiled, and put away also. The salad (if lettuce) 
should be sprinkled with water (not placed in water), and put 
in a cool, dark place in a basket, not to be touched until the 
last three minutes. 

The plates and platters for each course should be counted, 
examined, and placed on a table by themselves. 

After this, the kitchen should be put in order, and the tables 
cleared of all unnecessary things. Then everything needed 
for the courses to be cooked should be placed in separate 
groups at the back of a large table, so that there may be no 
confusion or loss of .anything at the last minute. If there are 
sweetbreads, have them egged and bread-crumbed ; if peas 
.are to be served with them, place them in a basin at their side, 
properly seasoned. If there is macaroni with cheese, have the 
proper quantity desired already broken on a dish, with a plate 



380 COMPANY DINNERS. 



of grated cheese and a tin cup, with the necessary amount of 
butter to be melted, side by side. If there is a fillet of beef to 
be baked and served with a mushroom sauce, have the fillet in 
the baking pan already larded, the mushrooms in the basin in 
which they are to be cooked, at the side ; also the piece of 
lemon and the spoonful of flour ready. The stock will be in 
the kettle at the back of the stove. By-the-way, in giving a 
fine dinner, there should always be an extra stock-pot, separate 
from the soup, at the back of the stove, as it is excellent for 
boiling the sweetbreads or the macaroni, and making the 
sauces, etc. 

If a simple salad of lettuce is to be served, have the oil, 
vinegar, pepper and salt, and the spoonful of finely chopped 
onion, in a group all ready. If a Mayonnaise dressing is to be 
served, that should be made in the morning. 

Look at the clock in the kitchen, and calculate the time it 
will take each dish to cook, and put it to the fire, so that it will 
be finished "toa turn " just at the proper minute. 

During dinner, one person should attend to placing out of 
the way all the dishes brought from the dining room, and, if 
necessary, should wash any spoons, platters, etc., which may 
be needed a second time. She should know beforehand, 
however, just what she is to wash, as every one must know 
exactly her own business, so that no questions need be asked 
at the last moment. The cook can attend to nothing but the 
cooking, at the risk of neglecting this most important part. 

As the course just before the salad is sent into the dining 
room, begin to make the salad, having everything all ready. 
First, pick over the lettuce leaves, wash and leave them to 
dra.in, while you prepare the dressing. It should just be ready 
when its turn comes to be sent to the table. 

If the dinner company is very large, and there are many 
dishes, the cooking of them may be distributed between two 
persons, and perhaps the second cook may use the laundry 



COMPANY DINNERS. 38. 



stove ; but with a little practice and the one or two assistants, 
one cook can easily prepare the most elaborate dinner, if it is 
only properly managed before the time of cooking. She should, 
of course, never attempt any dish she has not made before. A 
bain-marie is very convenient for preserving cooked dishes, \i 
there is some delay in serving the dinner. 

Of all things, never on any occasion serve a large joint or 
large article of any kind on a little* platter, as nothing looks so 
awkward. Let the platter always be at least a third larger than 
the size of its contents. 

We give several bills of fare which are long enough and good 
enough for any dinner party. Guests do not care for better or 
more, if these are only properly cooked. They can be easily 
prepared in one's own house, and this is always more elegant 
than to have a list of a hundred dishes from a restaurant.

are necessarily prepared at dinner time. The oyster course is 
very simple, and may be placed on the table before the guests 
enter the dining room. The soup may be made the day before, 
and only requires heating at the time of serving. The char- 
lotte russe can be purchased, if desired, at the confectioner's, 
or the cake for it may be made the day before. So, after the

meats are ready, the cook has nothing more to do but to make 

the salad, which is an affair of three minutes, and the coffee, 

for which she has a long time (the coffee having been ground 

and in readiness in the coffee pot two or three hours before 

dinner). The four last courses before the coffee are easily 

purchased outside. The cheese may be a Cheddar or a Roquefort- 

The fruit may be on the table during the dinner as one ofthe

1186. SERVING OF WINES. 

At dinners of great pretension, from eight to twelve different 
kinds of wines are sometimes served. This is rather ostenta- 
tious than elegant. In my judgment, neither elegance nor 
good taste is displayed in such excess. Four different kinds%f 
wine are quite enough for the grandest occasions imaginable, 
if they are only of the choicest selection. Indeed, for most 
occasions, a single wine — a choice claret — is quite sufficient. 
In fact, let no one hesitate about giving dinners without any 
wine at all. Proper respect for conscientious scruples about 



3§4 



MENUS WITH WINES. 



serving wine would forbid a criticism as to the propriety of 
serving any dinner without it. Such dinners are in quite as 
good taste, and will be just as well appreciated by sensible 
people ; and it makes very little difference whether people who 
are not sensible are pleased or not. 

1 187. Menus with Wines. 

If three wines are served let it be a fine Sauterne with the 

fish, a claret with the roast, and a champagne with the fruit 

and dessert, and if a fourth is desired let it be a Chateau Yquem 

with an entree. The following arrangement of a menu where 

wines are served, is decidedly original, showing the guest at a 

glance the wines he may expect, and thereby enabling him to 

regulate the consumption thereof; it may be varied to suit 

the host.

By consulting the article on "Suitable Combination of 
Dishes" No. 11 88, Page 386, a variety of Menus can be pre- 
pared to suit any taste, and be regulated as to expense, in the 
selection, or by the addition or omission of dishes to each 
course. 

1189. Proper Temperature in which Wines Should 
be Served. 

Sherry should be served thoroughly chilled. 

Madeira should be neither warm nor cold, but of about the 
same temperature as the room. 

Claret should be served at the same temperature as Madeira, 
never with ice ; pure wines most generally will form a deposit 



2B 



386 SUITABLE COMBINATION 

in the bottles, and many condemn the wine as being impure, 
while the contrary is the rule ; wines having a deposit in the 
bottle should be allowed to stand in a cool (not cold) place 
till settled, and either be carefully decanted, or served with a 
table wine basket. 

Champagne should either be kept on ice for several hours 
previous to serving, or it should be half frozen ; it is then 
called Champagne frappe. It is frozen with some difficulty. 
The ice should be pounded quite fine, then an equal amount of 
salt mixed with it. A quart bottle of champagne well sur- 
rounded by this mixture should be frozen in two hours, or, 
rather, frozen to the degree when it may be poured from the 
bottle 

1189. SUITABLE COMBINATION OF DISHES. 

There are dishes which seem especially adapted to be served 
together. This should be a matter of some study. Of course, 
very few would serve cheese with fish, yet general combinations 
are often very carelessly considered. 

Soup. 

Soup is generally served alone ; however, pickles and crackers 
are a pleasant accompaniment for oyster soup, and many serve 
grated cheese with macaroni and vermicelli soups. A pea or 
bean soup (without bread a-outons) at one end of the table, 
with a neat, square piece of boiled pork on a platter at the other 
end, is sometimes seen. When a ladleful of the soup is put in 
the soup plate by the hostess, the butler passes it to the host, 
who cuts off a thin wafer-slice of the pork, and places it in the 
soup. The thin pork can be cut with the spoon. Hot boiled 
rice is served with gumbo soup. Well-boiled rice, with each 
grain distinct, is served in a dish by the side of the soup 
tureen. The hostess first puts a ladleful of soup into the soup 
plate, then a spoonful of the rice in the center. This is much 
better than cooking the rice with the soup. 



OF DISHES. 3S7 



Sometimes little squares (two inches square) of thin slices of 
brown bread (buttered) are served with soup at handsome 
dinners. It is a French custom. Cold slaw may be served at 
the same time with soup, and eaten with the soup or just after 
the soup plates are removed. 

Fish. 

The only vegetable to be served with fish is the plain boiled 
potato. It may be cut into little round balls an inch in diam- 
eter, and served in little piles as a garnish around the fish, or 
it may be the flaky, full-sized potato, served in another dish. 
Some stuff a fish with seasoned mashed potatoes, then serve 
around it little cakes of mashed potatoes, rolled in egg and 
bread crumbs, and fried. Cucumbers, and sometimes noodles, 
are served with fish. 

Beef. 

Almost any vegetable may be served with beef. If potato is 
not served with fish, it generally accompanies the beef, either 
as a bed of smooth mashed potatoes around the beef, or a la 
neigc, or as fried potato balls (a la Parisienw ) , or, in fact, 
cooked in any of the myriad different ways. At dinner com 
panies, beef is generally served with a mushroom sauce. How- 
ever, as any and all vegetables are suitable for beef, it is only 
a matter of convenience which to choose. Horse-radish is a 
favorite beef accompaniment. 

Corned Beef 

should be served with carrots, turnips, parsnips, cabbage, or 
pickles around it. 

Turkeys. 
Cranberry sauce, or some acid jelly, such as currant or plum 
jelly, should be served with turkey. Many garnish a turkey 
with sausages made of pork or beef. Any vegetable may be 
served with a turkey ; perhaps onions, cold slaw, turnips, 
tomatoes, and potatoes are the ones oftenest selected. 



2,88 SUITABLE COMBINATION 

Chickens. 

Fried chickens with cream dressing are good served with 
cauliflower on the same dish, with the same sauce poured over 
both. A boiled chicken is generally served in a bed of boiled 
rice. A row of baked tomatoes is a pretty garnish around a 
roast chicken*. It is fashionable to serve salads with chickens- 
Lamb 
Is especially nice served with green peas or with spinach ; 
.cauliflowers and asparagus are also favorite accompaniments. 

Pork. 

The unquestionable combination for pork is fried apples, 

apple sauce, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, or Irish potatoes. Pork 

sausages should invariably be served with apple sauce or fried 

apples. Thin slices of breakfast bacon make a savory garnish 

for beefsteak. Thin slices of pork, egged and bread-crumbed, 

fried, and placed on slices of fried mush, make a nice breakfast 

dish ; or it may garnish fried chickens, beefsteak, or breaded 

chops. 

Mutton. 

The same vegetables mentioned as suitable for lamb are 
appropriate for mutton. The English often serve salad with 
mutton. 

Veal. 

Any vegetable may be served as well with veal as with beef. 
We would select, however, tomatoes, parsnips, or oyster plant. 

Roast Goose, 

Apple sauce, and turnips especially. 

Game. 
Game should invariably be served with an acid jelly, such as 
a currant or a plum jelly. Saratoga potatoes, potatoes a la 
Parisienne, spinach, tomatoes, and salads, are especially suitable 
for game. 



OF DISHES. 389 

Cheese 

Is served just before the dessert. It is English to serve celery 
or cucumbers with it. Thin milk crackers or wafer biscuits 
(put into the oven just a moment before serving, to make them 
crisp) should be served with cheese ; butter also for spreading 
the crackers, this being the only time that it is usually allowed 
for dinner. Macaroni with cheese, Welsh rare-bits, cheese 
omelets, or little cheese cakes, are good substitutes for a cheese 
course. 

Sweetbreads, 

Sweetbreads and peas — this is the combination seen at 
almost every dinner company. They are as nice, however, 
with tomatoes, cauliflowers, macaroni mixed with tomato sauce 
or cheese, or with asparagus or succotash 



39° ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 
1190. Toad in a Hole. 

A VERY DELICATE AND DAINTY TID BIT. 

Take half a dozen of select oysters of uniform size, sprinkle 
with bread crumbs or cracker dust, cut half a dozen rashers of 
smoked bacon very thin, wrap one rasher around every oyster, 
securing the oyster in the bacon by means of a small wooden 
pin, lay them in a dish and put into a moderately hot oven ten 
minutes ; toast a slice of bread, and well butter it, place the 
oysters, when done, upon the buttered toast, and pour over the 
whole the juice, and serve hot. 

1 191. Pate or Meat Pie. (Mdme. Grimard.) [Time.— 

TO BAKE,, ONE AND ONE-FOURTH HOURS.] 

Articles. — our pounds of lean fresh pork, one medium 
sized onion, or four shallots, one tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, three cloves of garlic, and salt and pepper to taste. 

Directions. — Chop the onion or shallot and garlic fine and 
mix with the chopped parsley ; cut the meat into squares of 
about one inch, place at the bottom of a crockery bowl, 
a sprinkling of the chopped herbs, and salt and pepper, next a 
layer of meat, then repeat the sprinkling of herbs, and salt and 
pepper till the meat is all in, and then put a sprinkling of the 
herbs on top, cover the dish and let it stand twenty-four hours • 
make a paste similar to pie paste, (not too rich), line a pan 
with the crust about one-quarter inch thick, fill the crust with 
the meat evenly distributed, about one and one-half inches thick, 
cover with the crust about the same thickness as the bottom, 
and bake in a medium oven about one hour and a quarter, then 
take out the pie, have two small eggs beaten up with one-half 
of a cup of cream, cut a small hole in the top of the crust, pour 
in the cream and eggs, replace in the oven for about ten min-

ntes, and serve warm. The garlic may be omitted if desired, 
although the pate is much finer with it. 

1192. White Bread. 

FOR USE IN THE MORNING. MAKES FOUR LOAVES. 

Dissolve thoroughly one cake of Gaff, Fleischmann & Co.'s 
compressed yeast in a pint of lukewarm water, and stir in 
sifted flour until the mixture is a little thicker than griddle 
cake batter. Set it in a warm place, free from draft, until it 
rises and begins to go back. Your sponge is now complete. 
Add to the sponge one quart of lukewarm water, one tablespooi:- 
ful of salt, two of sugar, same of butter ; add sifted flour enough 
to make a dough as soft as can be handled. Knead well. When 
thoroughly light, knead, make into loaves, place in well-greased 
pans for final rising. This last kneading should be very thorough. 
When light, bake, remembering that it will " spring " still more 
in the oven. When baked, lean it against something, throw a 
cloth over it, and cool by contact with the air on all sides. We 
advise all to use the morning directions at first, as this yeast is 
quicker than any other known. 

1193. White Bread, Old Method. 

TO MAKE OVER NIGHT. 

Dissolve one cake of Gaff, Fleischmann & Co.'s yeast in two 
quarts of water. Add two tablespoonfuls, each, of salt, butter, 
and sugar ; also sifted flour enough to make a moderately stiff 
dough. Knead thoroughly. In the morning, when thoroughly 
light, make into four loaves and let stand about one hour, or 
till light, then bake. Keep dough moderately warm, in winter . 
in warm weather, cool. 

1194. White Bread, Quick Method. 

MAKES FOUR LOAVES. 

Dissolve thoroughly one cake of Gaff, Fleischmann & Co.'s 
compressed yeast in one pint of lukewarm water. Add one 
tablespoonful each of salt, sugar and butter; also sufficient

flour to make dough as soft as can be handled. Set in a warm 
place to rise. When light, make into loaves. 

1195. Parker House Rolls. 

MAKES THIRTY ROLLS. 

Two quarts of flour, measure after sifting ; mix with it one 

tablespoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, rub in one 

tablespoonful of lard or butter. Boil one pint of milk and cool 

it ; when lukewarm, add one-half of a cake of Gaff, Fleisch- 

mann & Co.'s compressed yeast, dissolved in one-half of a cup 

of lukewarm water or milk. Make a hole in the flour and pour 

in the milk and yeast, stirring in just flour enough to make a 

thin batter. Cover and let rise over night, and in the morning 

stir in the rest of the flour and knead for twenty minutes, using 

no more flour. The dough should be very stiff. Let it rise 

again ; when light, roll out one-half an inch thick and cut with 

a round or oval cutter. Fold the edges together ; rise again, 

well covered, until very light. Bake ten or fifteen minutes in 

a very hot oven. If not mixed over night, use a whole cake 

of yeast. 

1196. Buckwheat Cakes. 

Dissolve one cake of Gaff, Fleischmann & Co.'s compressed 
yeast in one and one-half quarts of water or milk ; add one tea- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of molasses or sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, and sufficient buckwheat (about 
two quarts) flour to make a batter. Let it rise over night ; in 
the morning thin if necessary and fry on a griddle. If wanted 
quick, use double quantity of yeast. 

1197, Excellent Buns. 
Dissolve one-half a cake of Gaff, Fleischmann & Co.'s com. 
pressed yeast in two cups of milk which has been boiled and 
cooled ; add one-half of a teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful 
of sugar, and flour to make a stiff batter. Let it rise over night; 
in the morning add one cupful of sugar, one-half of a cupful of 



ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 393 



melted or softened butter, and flour to make it stiff enough to 
knead. Let it rise again until light, then shape into small 
biscuit and rise again. Bake in a hot oven until brown, then 
rub over tops with milk and sugar, and let stand in oven a few 
minutes longer. Makes two dozen. 

1 198. Muffins, (Mrs. Coulson.) 

Articles. — Twelve heaping tablespoonfuls of flour, two 
heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a piece of butter half 
the size of an egg, half of a teaspoon ful of salt, one egg, 
sufficient milk to make a batter, a little thicker than pancake 
batter. 

Directions. — Mix the flour and baking powder together ; 
then add the salt, next milk enough to produce a smooth paste, 
melt the butter and add it, then the egg well beaten ; if the 
batter is not thin enough, add more milk. Bake in muffin 
rings in a quick oven. 

1199. Hints for Housekeepers. 

Boiling water will remove tea stains and many fruit stains ; 
pour the water through the stain, and thus prevent it from 
spreading through the fabric. Ripe tomatoes will remove ink 
and other stains from white cloth ; also from the hands. A 
teaspoonful of turpentine boiled with white clothes will aid 
the whitening process. Boiled starch is improved by the ad- 
dition of a little spermaceti, or salt, or both, or gum arabic 
dissolved. Beeswax and salt will make flat-irons as smooth 
as glass ; tie a lump of wax in a cloth, and keep it for 
that purpose ; when the irons are hot rub them with the wax 
rag, then scour with a paper or rag sprinkled with salt. Ker- 
osene will soften boots or shoes hardened by water, and render 
them as pliable as when new. Kerosene will make the kettles 
as bright as new ; saturate a woolen rag and rub with it ; it 
will also remove stains from varnished furniture. If a shirt-

ADDITIONAL RECIPES. 



bosom or any other article has been scorched in ironing, lay 
it where bright sun will fall directly on it ; it will take it en- 
tirely out. Fish may be scaled much easier by dipping them in 
boiling water for a minute. Cool rain water and soda will re- 
move machine grease from washable goods. Half a dozen on- 
ions planted in the cellar where they can get a little light, will 
do much towards absorbing and correcting the atmospheric 
impurities that are apt to lurk in such places.
