PREFACE 



This Volume contains a Complete System of 
Practical Cookery, so carefully adapted to the 
purposes of every-day life, that although a person 
totally unacquainted with the art here treated of 
may not be able at first to dress a dinner, merely 
byreferringtothis book, any Cook or Housekeeper, 
possessed of ordinary experience, will certainly 
have the means of knowing, without further help 
than what these pages afford, how to prepare, in 
the best manner, every dish at present in general 
use. 

There are Twenty- five Chapters in all, arranged 
in the order of the following List, each of which 
is preceded by those useful Preparatory Remarks, 
which are usually kept at the beginning o^ the 
volume, at a most inconvenient distance from the 
subject treated of. This is often em\)aTta«.^\i\^\ 



vi FBfitACE, 

B^B it U believed, the novelty in arra^^ni 
here adopted, will be found advantagt 
parties concerned.

A copious olpbabeUcal Table of Contents will 
be found at the beginning of the volume. 

Great pains have been taken to compose a work 
having, in all respects, a practical character. Care 
has also been used to collect valuable materials 
irom A-arioiN authentic sources, the chief object 
being the compoution of a treatise which might be 
called with truth, the Cook's Companion in the 
practice of Cookery ; and at the same time, be no 
less useful to the mistress of a family, if required 
for occasional reference. 

T^ chief requisites, in a work of this kind, are 
first, the intrinsic excellence of the precepts it con- 



PREFACBr VU 

tains; tfext, their economical adaptation to the 
habits and tastes of the majority of its readers ; 
and, lastly, sach a distinct arrangement of th& 
various parts, that no difficalty can arise in search- 
ing for what is wanted, nor any ambigaity in the 
meaning of the directions when found. 

A perfectly original bookiM Cookery would 
neither meet with, nor deserve, much attention ; 
because what is wanted in this matter, is not re- 
ceipts for new dishes, but clear instructions how 
to make those already established in public favour* 
The study, therefore, of the author has been to 
consult the best authorities ; to compare different 
receipts with care and impartiality^ md after- 
wards to select for publication those'Vnly which 
appeared economical, easy to follow, and calcula- 
ted to furnish the dishes required for daily use, 
as well as those for occasions of ceremony. But 
nothing has been considered worthy of adoption, 
however high its pretensions, without some spe- 
cific and substantial recommendations. Every 
receipt, therefore, has either been actually tried 
by the author, . or by persons whose accuracy in 
the various manipulations could be safely relied 
upon. 

The defects usually complained of in most 
Cookery books are their extravagance, and their 
want of distinctness in the directions. In many 
cases, they are perversely adapted exclusively to 
the finances of persons who never t\ink of xeaAm^ 



%eceipt3 at all) but who overeome the whole diffi^ 
Ottlty by keeping bigbly-edacated, and, of eoiurse^ 
expensive CJooks. Such works, therefore, afford 
little assistance to the young mistress of a family, 
to country servants^ or even to persons who live^ 
in towns, but whose circumstances are so limited, 
that, with all the disposition in the world to learn 
the art of Cookery, they haye no means of putting 
such costly lessons in practice. 

It is hoped that such critidusms will not apply 
to this work : as the author has used e^ery effort 
of industry and patience, to arrive at the truth, 
and to impart it clearly and forcibly to others, so 
that corractii knowledge and judicious economy 
might go ntnd in hand, in this important branch 
of housekeeping. ^ 



PREFACE 



TO THE THIRD EDITION. 



Every Receipt in this Work has been carefully 
revised for this Edition, in order that advantage 
might be taken of the numerous valuable criti- 
cisms by which it has been honoured in all parts 
of the Empire. 

A considerable number of new Receipts have 
also been added ; but only such as the Author has 
had adequate means of ascertaining to be valuable 
— a principle which has been scrupulously adhered 
to throughout the volume.

THE 

PRACTICE OF COOKERY. 



CHAPTER I. 
SOUPS. 

FREPARATORT REltfARKS ON SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

I 

£ VERY utensil employed in a kitchen must be kept 
scrnpnloiisly clean, and a cook ought to take especial 
eare that all her sau^-pans be in good order. Brass pans 
are preferable for preserving in, and cast-iron and double 
block-tin are the best sort in use for every ofther purpose ; 
their covers should be made to fit closely, and the tinning 
of the cast-iron pots and pans always renewed as soon as 
it is observed to be wearing off. While new, they may 
he easily kept clean by washing them regularly with hot 
water, and rubbing on them when quite dry, a little white- 
ning with leather or flannel. After long use, they will 
require occasional scouring with fine sand; and before 
they are used, they ought always to be rinsed out with 
hot water, and wiped with a clean cloth. A landlady 
will find it good economy, and for her advantage in other 
respects, to provide plenty of stone-ware and earthen 
vessels, atid also common dishes for the kitchen, that the 
td)le-8et may not be used to keep cold meat on. 

In boiling soup, less water is used in a digester than in 
ttommon pot, as in the digester to steant can escape. 

A 



2 SOUPS. 

To extract the strength from meat, long and slow boil- 
ng is necessary^ but care must be taken that the pot is 
never, off the boil. All soaps are the better for being 
made the day before they are to be used, and they should 
then be strained into earthen pans. When sonp has jel- 
lied in the pan, it shottld not be removed into another, as 
breaking it will occasion its becoming sour sooner than 
it would otherwise do ; when in danger of not keeping, it 
should be boiled up. It never keeps long with many vege- 
tables in it. The meat used for soups or broths cannot 
be too fresh. When any animal food is plain boiled, the 
liquor, with the addition of the trimmings of meat and 
poultry, makes good soups and gravies, as do also the 
bones of roasted or broiled meat. The gravies left in the 
dishes answer for hashes, and the liquor in which veal 
has been boiled, may be made into a glaze by iKHling it 
with a ham h&ae till reduced to a third or fourth part» 
and seasoning it with the necessary herbs and spices. 

In boiling wea&k soups, the pan should be uncovered 
that the watery particles may escape. Cow-heel jelly 
improves every sort of rich soup ; and for thickenings 
truffles, morels, and dried mushrooms, may be used wiA 
advantage. 

Directions are given with each of the following sonpe 
for thickening with flour and butter^^ cieam and egga^ 
after the cream and eggs are added, die ioup must not be 
allowed to boil. ^ 

Should brown gravy or mock-tiutie soup be spoiling^^ 
fresh-made charcoal, roughly poiuide4» tied in a little \fmff 
and boiled with either, will absorb the bad flavour, andr

To Dress a Turtle weighing one hundred and twenty 

pounds. 

Turtle Soup. 

Having cut off the head close to the shell, hang up the 
turtle till next day, then open it, bearing the knife heavily 
on the back of the animal in cutting it off all round ; turn 
it on its end, that all the water and bipod may run out, then 
cut the flesh off along the spine, sloping the knife towards 
the bones so as .to avoid touching the gall, and having 
also cut the flesh from the legs and other members, wash 
the whole well and drain it. A large vessel of boiling 
water being ready on the fire, put in the breast shell, and 
when the plates will separate easily, take them out of the 
water ; boil the back and belly in water till the softer 
parts can be taken off easily ; but before they are sufli- 
ciently done, as they are to be again boiled in the sauce, 
lay them to cool singly in earthen vessels that they may 
not stick together ; let the bones continue to stew for some 
time, as the liquor must be used for moistening the sauces. 

All the flesh cut from the body, the four legs and head» 
must be stewed in the following manner:. Lay a few 



SOUPS. S7 

slices of ham on the bottom of a large stew-pan, and over 
the ham two or three knuckles of veal^ then above the 
Tea], the inside flesh of the turtle, and that of the members 
oyer the whole, adding a large bunch of sweet herbs, snch 
as sweet basil, sweet marjoram, lemon- thyme, a handful of 
parsley, i(nd green onions, and a large onion stuck with 
six cloves. Tlien partly moisten it with the water in which 
the shell is boiling, and when it has stewed some time, 
moisten it again with the liquor in which the back and 
belly have been boiled. When the legs are tender, take 
them out, drain, and put them aside to be afterwards 
added to the sauce; and when the flesh is completely 
done, drain it through a silk sieve, and mix with the 
sauce some very thin white roux ; then cut all the softer 
parts, now sufficiently cold, into pieces about an inch 
square, add them to the sauce, and let them simmer gen- 
tly till they can be easily pierced ; skim it well. 

Next chop a small quantity of herbs, and boil them with 
a little sugar in four bottles of madeira till reduced to two, 
then rub it through a tammy, mix it with the turtle sauce, 
and let it boil for a short time. Make some forcemeat 
balls as follows : Cut off about a pound of meat from the 
fleshy part of a leg of veal free from sinews or fat, soak in 
milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread ; when 
quite soft, squeeze and put it into a mortar, together with 
the veal, a small quantity of calf s udder, a little butter, 
the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, a little cayenne, salt, 
and spices ; pound the whole very finely, then thicken 
the mixture with two whole eggs and the yolk of a third, 
ihrow a bit into boiling water, and if not sufficiently firm, 
add the yolk of another egg, and for variety some chop- 
ped parsley may be mixed with half of the forcemeat. 
Let the whole cool, so that it may be formed into balls 
about the size of the yolk of an egg, poach them in boil- 
ing water, and add them to the turtle. Before serving, 
mix a little cayenne with the juice of two or three lemons, 
and add it to the soup. It is generally preferable to pre- 
pare the soup the day before it is required for use, and 
it will be best heated in a water bath, or flat vessel con-

dish, they must he first parboiled, then skinned, and 
stewed in a little turtle sauce, with some port wine, and 
seasoned with cayenne, salt, and a little lemon juice, and 
thickened with butter and flour* 

Friciwdeanx and blanqnettes may also be made of the

CHAPTER 11. 
FISH. 

PSEPAIUkTOmY REMAEK8 OK FISH. 



TuBBOT ; — a good one is thick, and the beUy eream- 
d^oured. If the belly and fins be streaked with red, it 
is certainly fresh. When it must be kept, it should be 
buBg up by the tail in a cool place* The same directions 
spply to soles and flounders* 

Cod ; — when good, has a small head, broad shoulders^ 
and a hollow at the back of the neck, and a small and 
stiff tail. 

Salmon, haddocks, mackerel, whiting, herrmg, and 
^rats, should all be firm, and chosen with small heads, 
thick shoulders, and small tails. 

Smelts ; — when perfectly fresh, smeU like a newly-cut 
encumber. 

Carp, tench, pike, and perch;— when fresh, the eyes 
•le bright, the body stiff, the gills red, and hard to open* 

The silver eel, so called from the bright colour of the 
belly, is the most esteemed. 

Skate ; — ^the female is the best, and when good is thick, 
and has a yery white belly, tinged with lilac. That with 
large thorns is a very inferior fish« 



40 FISH. 

A lobster sbould be ratber heavy, in proportion to its 
size. When in perfection, tbe sbell on the side will not yield 
to moderate pressure. Barnacles and other marine animals 
adhering to it are certain indications of superior goodness. 
If the berries appear large and brownish, it will be found 
watery and poor. The cock lobster is in general better 
than tbe hen, and & distinguished by its narrow tail. 

Crabs ; — ^the male is the best, and may be known by its 
narrow breast. When light, they are watery ; which may 
more easily be detected after they are boiled ; by then 
holding them firmly and shaking them, the rattling of the 
water will be heard. 

Prawns and shrimps are good when their tails turn 
strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant smell. 

When oysters are alive and strong, the shell, in open- 
ing them, will close upon the knife. Those from the 
coast of Kent, and those called Pandore, from the Frith 
of Forth, are the most esteemed. 

On Dressing Fish. 

Fish must by no means be allowed to remain in the 
water after it is boiled ; if, therefore, it should be ready 
before it can be sent to table, it must be dished, the cover 
put on, and a cloth put over it. The dish is then to be 
set across the fish-kettle. 

Fish should be fried over a clear quick fire, and with 
dripping, or hog's lard, in preference to butter. The pan 
should be deep ; and to ascertain that it is clean, a little 
fat is first fried in it, poured out, and the pan wiped with 
a clean doth ; as much dripping or lard is then put in as 
will entirely cover the fish. When it is boiling hot, and 
begins to smoke, tbe fiah is put in ; if small, they may be

timed in tbree or four miuutes, by stickiDg in a fork near 
be bead with the one hand, and with the other rapport- 
]g the tail with a fish-slice. When they are done, they 
honld be bud before the fire upon an old soft towel, and 
imed DOW and then till they are dry upon both sides ; 
r they may be put upon a large sieve, turned upwards, 
ad which is kept for the purpose, or ^ut on the nnder- 
de of a dish. 

The fire for broiling fish must be very clear, and the 
ridiron perfectly clean, which, when hot, should be rab- 
ed with a bit of suet. The fish, while broiling, must 
B often turned. 



Berwick Receipt for Boiling Salmon. 

The tail of the salmon is first cut off near and below 
le last fin, the fish is then cut up the back, keeping the 
one on one side, and then cut up into pieces of half a 
ound each, the blood well washed out of the fish in coH 
'ater, but the scales not to be remoyed ; a pickle to be 
lade of salt and water, strong enough to bear an eg^, 
id, when boiling, the fish to be put in, and boiled very 
nickly for fifteen minutes. During the boiling, the 
nun to be taken off carefully as soon as it rises. Sauces ; 
-lobster, melted butter, and anchovy sauce.

Jmon. 

A Receipt for Boiling Salmon, by an 
Aberdeen Fisherman. 

When the water is hot, pat salt into it, and stir it 

ell ; taste it ; when strong enough to force you to cast 

from your mouth, it will do ; whdn the water boils put 



42 FISH*

a salmon, and sixteen for a grilse. When salmon is cut 
in slices an inch thick, let them boil from ten. to fifteen 
minutes. 

Serve with it a sauce tnreen of the fiquor the fish was 
l^oiled in. 

To Broil Salmon Steaks. 

Cut the steaks from the thickest part of the fish, 
nearly an inch thick ; butter pieces of white paper ; fold 
the steaks in them, and broil them orer a slow fire for 
ten or twelve minutes. Take off the paper ; serve and 
garnish with plenty of fried parsley. Dressed in this 
way, they may be put round salmon boiled, in slices. 
Sauces ; — melted butter, lobster, or shrimp sauce. 

To Bake Salmon. 

Clean and cut the fish into slices, put it in a dish, and 
make the following sauce : Melt an ounce of butter, 
kneaded in flour, in a pint and a half of gravy, with two 
glasses of port wine, two table-spoonfuls of catsup, two 
anchovies, and a little cayenne. When the anchovies

Kipper, or Dried Salmon. 

Cut the fish up the back, and take out the bone ; wipe 
it very clean with a cloth ; score it, and put a handful of 
salt on each side, and let it lie for three days ; then hang

it dean, and sprinkle it with salt ; let it lie a night to 
dcBin off the liquor; wipe it dry; rub on it two or three 
ounces of pounded saltpetre ; cut it into pieces ; pack it 
close in a pot, with a thick layer of salt between each 
layer of fish. If the brine does not rise in a few days, 
boil a strong one, and pour it, when cold, upon the sal- 
mon, which must always be covered with it. 

The bone, or chine of salmon, as it is called in Leith, 
eats well with salt and pepper strewed over it, cut in 
bits of three or four inches, and broiled over a clear fire. 

Salmon Fritters. 

Cut small some cold boiled salted salmon; pound 
some boiled potatoes, moistened with cream, and the yolk 
of an egg beaten ; mix them together, and make it into 
small fritters, and fry them of a light brown in fresh lard,

half an ounce of whole black pepper, three cloves, two 
Uades of mace, and a little salt. Cut the fish in slices, 
and fry them of a light-brown colour in fine oil, or clari- 
fied dripping ; put them, when cold, into a pan, pour over 
them the vinegar and spices, and put en the top eight or 
ten spoonfuls of oil. 

Soles may be done in this way, only lay over them 
sliced onions instead of shalots.

onion, six bay leaves, and six anchovies ; with this season 
each slice ; put them into a pan, with very thin slices of 
batter between each layer; bake it; when well done^ 
drain off the hotter, and, when cold, ponr over it some 
clarified bntter. 

Spiced Salmon. 

Mix together, in the proportion of one-third of salt- 
and-water to one pint of vinegar, one ounce of whole 
black pepper, and one ounce of cinnamon. Cut the sal- 
mon into slices, and boil it in this ; when cold, pack it 
close in a pan, and pour over it the liqnor it was boiled in, 
with the spices, so as to cover it completely ; cover the 
pan closely, to exclude the air. 

Pickled Salmon. 

Cut the salmon into pieces ; boil it as for eating, and 
lay it on a dry cloth till the following day ; boil two 
quarts of good vinegar with one of the liquor the fish was 
boiled in, one ounce of whole black pepper, half an ounce 
of allspice, and four blades of mace. Put the salmon into 
something deep, and pour over it the prepared vinegar 
when cold. A little sweet oil put upon the top will 
make it keep a twelvemonth. 

Another Pickled Salmon. 

To a quart of the liquor the fish has been boiled id, 
put rather more than half a pint of good vinegar, and half 
an ounce of whole black pepper ; boil it, and when it is 
cold pour it over the fish, previously laid in a deep dish. 

To Boil Turbot. 

Put into the turbot kettle, with the water, two large 
handfuls of salt, and a tea-cupful of vin^:ar ; when it 
boils very fut, take off the scum, put in the turbot, and 
when it boils again, keep it boiling fast till the turbot rises 
from the drainer, when it is sufficiently done. Dish anl 



FISH. 45 

garnish it with a fringe of curled parsley and cat lemon. 
Sauces ; — lobster and melted butter. 

Cold boiled tarbot eats well with salad sauce. 

Turbot is generally considered best perfectly fresh; 
but some people prefer it kept for a few days, hung up 
by the tail in a cool place. 

To Boil a Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Wash it clean; tie it up, and dry.it with a cloth. 
Allow, in the proportion of every three measures of 
water, one of salt ; when it boils, take off the scum, put 
in ^e fish, and keep it boiling very fast for twenty-five 
or thirty minutes. Serve with it the roe cut into slices 
and fried with the chitterlings ; and garnish with curled 
parsley and horse-radish. Sauces ;— oyster, melted but- 
ter, or anchovy and butter. 

To Dress a Cod's Head and Shoulders. 

Wash the cod's head and shoulders well ; cut off the 
fins ; lay it on a dish ; pour some boiling water over part 
of the fish, and instantly scrape off all the black scales, 
taking care not to break the skin ; repeat this till every 
part of the fish looks white, and then wash it in cold water. 
Put it on in boiling salt-and- water, and boil it for a quar- 
ter of an hour ; then lay it on a dish, and rub it all over 
with the yolks of two or three beaten eggs, and strew it 
thickly with grated bread crumbs, mixed with pepper and 
minced parsley. Stick it all over with little bits of but- 
ter, and put it in an oven to brown. Mix a large table- 
•poonful of flour with a quarter of a pound of butter, a 
quart of gravy, a tea-cupful of white wine, some pepper, 
salt, and a little grated nutmeg. Mince the white meat 
of a lobster ; slightly brown three dozen of oysters in a 
frjdng-pan, and put them with half their liquor and the 
lobster to the gravy, and other things ; heat it up, and 
pour it round the fish. Garnish with cut lemon. It is not 
necessary to have lobster and oysters, but it is the better 
for both. 

To dress the same dish with a white sauce, the stock

it, and let it boil gently from one hour to one and a ha]£ 
The rery thick part will take this time^ the thin bits les% 
to dress. When dished, garnish with hard-boiled eggs 
and parsley. 

Plain boiled parsnips, and a butter tureen of egg sauce, 
serFed with it. 

When the fish is put on tbe second time, some people 
bolting it in milk-and-water. To keep any of this 
Mfft of fish fmr winter use, it ought to be cut or sawed im 
pieces, and, when perfectly dry, laid in a small cask or 
wooden box, with oatmeal, oatmeal seeds, or malt dust, 
between each layer.

FREPARATORT REMARKS. T5 

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON BEEF. 

Ox Beef is considered the best. The flesh should feel 
tender, be fine in the grain, and of a bright red colour, 
nicely marbled or mixed with fat. The &t should be 
white, rather than of a yellow colour. 

Heifer Beef is excellent when finely fed, and is most 
suitable for small families. The bone should be taken 
out of a round of beef before it is salted, and it must be 
washed, skewered, and bound round firmly before being 
boiled. Salt beef should be put on with plenty of cold 
water, and when it boils the scum removed. It is then 
kept simmering for some hours. A piece weighing fif- 
teen poimds will require three hours and a half to boiL 
Carrots and turnips for garnishing should be put on to 
boil with the beef. If in the least tainted, a piece of 
charcoal may be boiled with it. 

When beef is to be kept any length of time, it should 
be carefnlly wiped every day. In warm weather, wood 
■vinegar is an excellent preservative : it is put all 4>ver the 
meat with a brush. To protect the meat from flies, it 
may be sprinkled over with pepper. Tainted meat may 
be restored by washing in cold water, afterwards in 
strong camomile tea^ after which it may be sprinkled 
with salt, and used the foliowing day, first washing it in 
cold water. Koughly pounded charcoal rubbed all over 
the meat also restores it when tainted. In summer, 
meat in Scotland is frequently kept a fortnight smothered 
in oatmeal, and carefully wiped every day; and if it 
should be a little tainted, it is soaked for some hours be- 
fore it is used, in oatmeal and water. 

These directions apply equally to all sorts of meat. 



76 BEEF. 

The sirloin is the prime joint for roasting. When to be 
used, it should be washed, then dried with a clean cloth, 
and the fat covered over with a piece of white paper 
tied on with thread. The spit should be kept at all 
times exceedingly clean : it must be wiped dry imme- 
diately after it is drawn from the meat, and washed and 
scoured every time it is used. Care should be taken to 
balance the roast properly upon the spit ; but, if not ex- 
actly right, it is better to make it equal by fastening on 
a leaden-headed skewer than to pierce it again. The 
fire should be prepared by putting on plenty of coals at 
the back. When put down, it should be about ten inches 
from the fire, and gradually drawn nearer. It is first 
basted with a little butter or fresh dripping, and then 
well basted with its own fat all the time it is roasting. 
Ten minutes before serving, it should be sprinkled with 
a little salt, then dredged with flour, and basted till it is 
frothed. When it is drawn from the spit some gravy 
will run out, to which may be added a little boiling salt- 
and-water poured along the bone : th^e beef is then gar- 
nished with plenty of finely scraped horse-radish. A 
sirloin, weighing about fifteen pounds, should be roasted 
for three hours and a half. A thinner piece of the same 
weight requires only three hours. In cold weather meat 
requires longer roasting than in warm, and if newly killed 
than if it has been kept.

. To Stew a Rump of Beef. 

Tie up the beef, and put it on to stew with near]}^ as 
miich cpld water as will coFer it ; add three pounds of fat 
brnxm cot into slices, a handfol of thyme, eight onions, 
fear small carrots, two turnips, two or three bay lea^es^ 
some. black pepper, a little allspice, mace, and three 
dpyefly a put of port wine, and one of sherry. Let it stew 
gently between se^en and eight hours. Take out the beef, 
strain the liquor, and skim off all the fat ; thicken it witb 
a little flour rubbed down in cold water, boil it up, and 
poor it.OFer the beef. Have ready carrots and turnips, 
cot according to fancy, and boiled tender in weak gravy, 
and put them round the beef before serving. 

Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. 

Bind the beef tightly, stick into it four cloves, and put 
it into, a sauce-pan with three quarts of water, a quarter of 
ka ounce of black pepper half-beaten, some salt, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, and three anchovies ; turn it often, and 
when half done take it out, pour off the liquor ; put in 
the beef again, with a pint of port wine and half a pint 
of table-beer made scalding hot, and some of the liquor 
strained ; stew it till tender, clear off the fat, and if the 
sauce is not strong enough^ add well-seasoned beef gravy ; 
thicken it with flour rubbed down in a little cold water. 
Dish the beef, and pour the gravy round it. 

Another way to Stew a Rump of Beef. 

Fry a small rump, or fore rib of beef in butter till it 
is brown all over. Make a sauce with butter browned 
with flour, and some water in which two or three onions 
have been boiled ; season with pepper, salt, and three 
table-spoonfuls of vinegar ; put in the beef, turn it fre- 
quently, and stew it gently for three hours. A little be- 
fore serving, add a tea- cupful of port wine. CaiTOts and 
turnips; cut into dice, may be stewed with it.

been stewed in, strained, and thickened with a little flour 
and butter, adding some green onions cut small, and 
pickled mushrooms. It is poured hot over the beef. 

Beef Olives. 

CpT the beef into long thin steaks ; prepare a forcemeat 
made of bread crumbs, minced beef-suet, chopped pars- 
ley, a little grated lemon-peel, nutmeg, pepper, and salt ;

in boiling fresh dripping. Serve them with fried bread 
cnimbsy <Nr with a thickened brown gravy. 

Minced CoUops. 

Cut two pounds of lean tender beef into thin slices — it 
is best taken from off the rump, or round ; mince it very 
finely; brown two ounces of butter in a frying-pan, 
dredging it with a little flour, then add the minced meat,

with one or two onions previously cut small and par- 
boiled ; season with pepper and salt ; brown in a sauce- 
pan a table-spoonful of butter ; add the minced meat ; 
beat it with a beater till it is of a light brown colour, 
then dust in a little flour, and add about half a pint of 
gravy or water, with half a table-spoonful of vinegar. 
Cover the sauce-pan closely, and let it stew gently for 
half an hour. A little before serving, add a table-spoon- 
fbl of mushroom catsup. The gravy may be made with 
the parings and stringy parts of the beef. When the fla- 



I

Tonr of onicms is ^sHked, boil some whole small onions^ 
ind garnish the dish with them. Minced collops^may 
be kept some weeks packed closely into a jar, after being* 
fried without any onions, and covered with clarified but- 
ter. When to be dressed, follow the above directions. 

Short, or Spiced Beef. 

'^o be eaten cold. 
Hang up ten or twelve pounds of the middle part 
of a brisket of beef for three or four days, ihea rub well 
into it three ounces of finely-powdered saltpetre, and if 
spice is approved of, one ounce of allspice, and half an" 
ounce of black pepper; let it stand all nighty then salt.it 
with three pounds of well-poimded bay salt, and half a 
pound of treacle^ in which let it remain ten days, rubbing 
it daily. When it is to be boiled, sew it diosely in a 
doth, let the water only simmer, upon no account allow- 
ing it to boil, for nine hours over a slow fire^ or upon a 
stove. When taken out of the water, place two sticks 
across the pot, and let the beef stand over the steam for 
half an hour, turning it from side to side, then press it 
with a heavy weight. It must not be taken out of the 
cloth till perfectly cold. 

To Salt Neats' Tongues- 

Salt two tongues, and turn them every day for four 
or five days ; then rub them with two ounces of common 
salt, one of brown sugar, and half an ounce of saltpetre ; 
turn them daily, and in a f<Mtnight they may be used. 

The best sort of vessel for salting them in is an earthen* 
ware pan, as wide at top as bottom, so that the tongues 
may lie in it long-ways. 

To Salt Beef for immediate Use. 

Salt a round of beef moderately upon the top and 
aides, put it upon sticks, or the tongs of a cheese-tub,^ 
over a tub of cold water, and the salt will be drawn 
through it, so that it will be fit for boiling next day. 



BEEF. 88 

Another method 

■

qnmtity of salt, and let it lie for three or four days with- 
4yiit toncfaing it, when it may be used. 

Pickle for Beef* 

Allow to four gallons of water two ponnds of brown 
sugar and six pounds of bay salt, boil it about twenty 
mimites, taking off the scnm as it rises ; the following day 
ponr it over &e meat which has been packed into the 
piddiiig^tab. Boil it up every two months^ adding three 
ounces of brown sugar and half a pound of common salt. 
By tins means it will keep good a year. The meat must 
be sjninkled with salt, and next dlay wiped dry, before 
pouring the pickle oyer it, with which it should always 
be completely covered. With the addition of two ounces 
of saltpetre and one pound of bay salt, this pickle answers 
for pickled pork^ hams, and tongues. The tongues should 
be rubbed with common salt, to cleanse them, and after- 
wards with a little saltpetre, and allowed to lie for four 
or five days before they are put into the pickle. The 
meat will be ready for use in eight or ten days, and will 
keep for three months. % 

To Collar Beet 

Cut off the end of a brisket of beef, and bone it ; 
sprinkle it with salt and saltpetre, and let- it lie a week ;

and parsley ; strew it over the meat, roll it up hard, sew 
it in a cloth, put it into a large jar of water, tie it close- 
ly, and bake it in an oven ; take it out of the jar, and press 
it with a heavy weight. When it is quite cold^ take off 
the cloth, and keep it dry.

of saltpetre, and two ounces of very brown sugar, and rub 
it well into the beef ; turn it every day, and if it become 
slimy, strew over it a little common salt, but let it be very 
little ; lay it upon a sloping board, that the brine may run 
off. Let it lie a fortnight, and hang it up to dry, but not 
too near the fire, nor in a warm kitchen, as it would then 
soon grow rancid.

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON MUTTON. 

The finest mutton is that 6f the mountain, or black- 
faoed sheep of Scotland, and that of the South Downs and 
Welsh sheep. Sheep are in perfection from the age of 
four to five. In May and June, or just before shearing, 
mutton tastes strongly of the coat, or what is called 
woolly. 

Wedder mutton, which is the best, may be known by a 
prominent lump of hX at the edge of the broadest part of 

6 17 l^W 



100 PREPARATOJIY REMARKS. 

the inside of the leg. That meat should be chosen which 
is fine in the grain, bright in the colour, and the fat firm 
and white. The flesh of the ewe is of a paler colour ; 
that of the ram is strongly flavoured, is of a deep red co- 
lour, and the fat sptmgy. 

For keeping mutton, the same directions may be ob- 
served as for keeping beef. 

The haunch is the prime joint. It should be roasted 
at a good brisk fire, and basted as beef, the fat being first 
covered with a piece of white paper. Before serving, half 
a sheet of foolscap paper, folded and fringed, should be 
put round the shank bone. 

The haimch, weighing fourteen pounds, will require two 
hours and a half to roast. Currant jelly sauce should be 
served with it. 

When a leg of mutton is to be boiled, it should first be 
washed clean, then put on, in boiling water, and careful- 
ly scummed. If weighing eight or nine pounds, it should 
be boiled nearly three hours, and then served with caper 
sauce. A saddle or a chine, that is to say, two necks or 
two loins, a joint, generally called, indifferently, a saddle 
of mutton, being broad, requires a high and strong fire. 
The skin should be taken off, and skewered on again, or 
paper may be substituted for it, tied on with a buttered 
string. It should be well basted, and a quarter of an 
hour before serving, the skin or paper removed ; it is 
then allowed to brown a little, is sprinkled with salt, 
basted, and dredged with flour, served with gravy in the 
dish, and currant jelly sauce. 

A shoulder of mutton should be roasted an hour and 
a half, and served with onion sauce, in a sauce tureen. 

A loin of mutton should be carefully jointed, roasted 



MUTTON. 101 

the same len^h of time as a shoulder, and is carved 
lengthwise. 

The best end of a neck of mutton should be jointed, 
and roastedy the same as the loin ; or it may be boiled. 
If boiled, the skin should be taken off before sefying, and 
cBper sauce poured over it. 

A breast of mutton may be parboiled, grilled, and 
served with onion and caper sauce. 

Many persons think that every kind of meat should 
be boiled in a floured cloth, and in the writer's opinion, 
this greatly improves its appearance. This, however, 
does not supersede the necessity of skimming, which, in 
boiling, should always be carefully attended to» 



To Dress a Shoulder of Mutton. 

BoKE a small shoulder of mutton ; roll it, and put it 
into a cloth ; put it on in boiling water. Have ready a 
nice white sauce ; stir into it some thick cream, and add 
some chopped Indian pickle. Make it all hot, but take 
care not to let it boil, and pour it over the mutton. 

French Mutton Steaks. 

Cut a neck of mutton into neat steaks ; put them in- 
to a sauce-pan, with sufficient water to cover them ; add 
a small bonch of sweet herbs, two or three onions, and 
some pepper. Let them boil two minutes ; take them 
put, and stew the trimmings of the steaks with the herbs 
till the gravy is sufficiently strong, then strain it, and 
lake off all the fat. Rub the steaks with a well-beaten 
yolk of an egg, strew over them bread crumbs mixed with 
finely chopped sweet herbs, and fry them of a nice brown. 
Thicken the gravy with a little browned butter and flour, 



102 ^ MUTTON# 

add a table-spoonfol of vinegar, and idien it ia quite hot, 

pour it into the dish, and lay in the steaks. 

Mutton Cutlets.

of a leg of mutton, and beat them ; mix with grated bread 
crumbs^ some pepper, salt^ and finely chopped parsley, le- 
mon^ thyme, and sweet marjoram. £.ub the cutlets with 
melted butter, and cover them thickly with the prepared 
bread ; fry them for ten minutes in butter, then put them 
into a sauce-pan, with eome good gravy thickened with 
flour and butter^ and simmer them for ten or fifteen 
minutes.' 

Mock Venison. 

Hang up a large fat loin of mutton for several days ; 
then bone it, and take off all the kidney fat, and the sidn 
from the upper fat ; mi]« together two ounces of brown 
sugar, and one ounce of ground black pepper. Rub it well 
into the mutton ; pour over it two or tluree wine-glasses 
of port wine ; keep it covered with the skin ; rub and 
turn it daily for five days. When it is to be roasted, cover 
it with the skin, and paper it the same way as venison ia 
done. Serve it with made gravy, and the same sauces as 
for venison* 

Maintenon Chops. 

Cut a neck of mutton into chopf ; beat diem flat with 
a rolling-pin. Bruise the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, and 
mix with it chopped sweet herbs, grated bread, nutmegs 
salt, and pepper. Cover the ste^Jcs with it, and put eadi 
into a piece of well-butlered paper; broil them, over a 
clear fire, turning them often. Serve them in the paper^ 
or with a browned gravy. 

A Haricot of Mutton. 

Trim the diops neatly, by shortening the bone ; if the 
whole of the best end of the neck is to ba used, put on

for fifteen minutes. Fry some sliced onions in a little 
butter ; take them out ; flour the chops, and fry them 
quickly, of a nice brown colour ; put them into a sauce- 
pan with the onions, and some carrots and turnips cut into 
* diee ; strain the grary into the frying-pan, boil it up, and 
add to the chops and vegetables, with two or three cloves, 
a little alls|^ and pepper. It should simmer for two 
homa ; and just before senang, clear off the scum, and 
thicken with a little flour rubbed down in cold water, and 
add a table^oonful of mushroom catsup.

CHAPTER V. 
LAMB. 

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON LAMB. 

The fore quarter of lamb consists of the shoulder, the 
neck, and the breast together ; the hind quarter is the 
leg and loin. There are also the head and pluck, the 
fry or sweetbreads, skirts, and liver. 

In choosing the fore quarter, the vein in the' neck 
should be ruddy, or of a bluish colour. In the hind 
quarter, the knuckle should feel stiff, the kidneys small, 
and perfectly fresh. To keep it, the joints should be 
carefully wiped every day, and, in warm weather, sprin- 
kled with a little pepper. The fore quarter is the prime 
joint, and should be roasted and basted with butter ; the 
gravy is made as for beef or mutton. Mint sauce is ser- 
ved in a sauce tureen, and half a lemon is sent to table 
with it, the juice of which is squeezed upon the ribs, af- 
ter the shoulder is cut off, and they have been sprinkled 
with salt. If the joint weighs ^ve pounds, it will require 
to be roasted one hour ; if ten pounds, one hour and 
three quarters. The hind quarter may be roasted, or the 
leg of it boiled. The loin is then cut into steaks, fried.

116 VEALi 



CHAPTER VI. 
VEAL. 

The names of the joints are as follows : 

IN KMGLAND. 

Loin, best end— Loin^ chump end— Fillet— Hind Knuc- 
kle — Fore Knuckle — Neck, best end— Neck, scrag 
end— Blade Bone— Dreast, best end—Breast, brisket 
end. 

IN HCOTLAND. 

The Loin, Fillet, and Knuckle — Back lUbs^Breast, 
Neck, and Head. 

In Scotland, the veal seldom exceeds four weeks old, 
therefore It Ia not cut into so many divisions as is the 
practice in England, where it is often eight weeks old. 
The entrails are named the pluck, which consists of 
the heart, liver, lights, nut, melt, and skirts, the throaty 
windpipe, and swccthreads. 

I'llKPARATOUY REMAUKS ON VEAL. 

Veal should be fine in the grain, firm, white, and fat, 
and the leg bone small. The finest calves have the small- 
er/ kidnvy, and its being well covered with thick white 



PREPARATORY REMARKS. 117 

fat, indicates good real. The fillet of a cow calf is to be 
preferred, on account of the udder. The prime ^ints are 
the fillet, the loin, the chump end of the loin, and the 
heat end of the itbck. To keep it, the same directions 
may be followed, which are given for keeping beef. 

When the fillet is to be roasted, it should be washed, 
well dried, and the bone taken out, the «pace filled with 
a fine stuffing, part of which should be put under the 
flap, then formed into a round, and firmly skewered* 
That the fire may be clear and strong, it should be made 
up some time before putting down the roast^ which should 
at first be placed at some distance from it, and be te- 
quently and well basted with butter. When about half 
roasted, a piece of white paper is tied over the fat ; a lit- 
tle before serving, it is removed ; the meat is then sprinkled 
with salt, dredged with flour, and well basted to froth it. 
When dished, finely melted butter is poured over it, with 
which may or may not be mixed some lemon pickle or 
brown gravy. It is garnished with cut lemon. 

A fillet weighing ten or fourteen pounds requires four 
hoiars to roast. The loin will take about three hours to 
roast; and is basted, the fat covered with paper, and 
served like the fillet. A slice of thin toasted bread is also 
served with it, on which the caryer should lay a part of 
the kidney fat, and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. 

A shoulder stuffed with forcemeat will take from two 
to three hours to roast. 

The best end of the neck may be roasted or boiled ; 
if boiled, melted butter, made thick with parsley, is poar<' 
ed over it. A knuckle of veal may be boiled and served 
in the same way. 

. Pickled pork, ham, bacon, tongue, or sausages, is the 
general accompaniment to roasted or boiled veal.

them some rich brown gravy. 

Casserole of Rice. 

Having cleaned and drained about half a pound of rice, 
moisten it in a stew-pan, with some fat — that which gathers 
on the top of liquor in which meat has been boiled ; strain 
some broth or soup, add to it a large quantity of grease, 
some pieces of fat bacon, and a little salt, and mix it with 
the rice, to make it swell as much as possible ; stir it fre- 
quently over a slow fire to keep it from sticking ; when it 
is soft strain it through a cullender, and press it well with 
a wooden spoon. The mould being selected for the cas- 
serole, rinse it with the fat drained frmn the rice, taking 
care that every part of the inside of the mould be well 
greased, then cover it with rice, and place a piece of the 
crnmb of bread in the middle, and cover it with rice also ; 
press it in equally with a spoon, and let it cool. When 
the rice has become firm, dip the outside of the mould 
into boiling water ; put a covering of paste made with fiour 
and water ; flatten it all round with a spoon, and make an 
opening in the top with a knife, then put it into the oven, 
vmich cannot be too hot for a casserole, baste it with the 
grease, and when it has become of a fine colour, take it 
out of the oven, remove the crust, and take out the bread 
carefuUy, so that the casserole may not be injured ; next 
remove some of the rice from the inside; taking care to 
leave enough to resist the weight of whatever may be put 
inside of it. Fill it with minced meat, ragout, blanquette, 
fricassee of ^ickens, macaroni, or scollops of fish, that 
have beeii'UKtdy served. at table ; retnni it to the oven, 
and when nicely browned, serve it

monldtf; those called dariole moulds, and it should be quite 
cold before it is turned out, the mince or whatever is put 
inside being also cold ; it must be put in carefully, that 
none of it may mix with the rice, otherwise the cassolettes 
would break in the process of frying; ; for the same reason, 
the dripping must be very hot. Frying is the best and 
quickest method of doing them, but they may also be 
browned in the oyen as the casserole of rice.

in a clotb, and sew it tightly ; boil it slowly for three 
hours^ and serve it with a white sauce. 

A Grenade. 

Put alternately into a small potting pan or jar, a layer 
of each of the following ingredients : Vermicelli, ham, 
bard-boiled yolks of eggs, veal, and highly-seasoned force- 
meat, all finely pounded^ excepting the vermicelli, which

little cream, nutmeg, lemon-peel, salt, and pepper^ and a 
little mushroom catsup. Put this mixture into the pat- 
ties, put on the top, and place them upright in a pudding 
dish, with a little butter in the bottom of it ; bake them 
in an oven ; a little bit cut off the bottom of each will 
make them stand even. 

Frogs. K ^ 

Having cut off the feet and the body, so as to have 
scarcely more than the legs, put them into boiling water, 
and let them boil a little ; next, put them into fresh wa- 
ter, and then drain them ; put them into a sauce-pan with 
some mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, cibol, a clove of 
garliCy two cloves and a bit of butter ; give them two or 
three tarns on the fire, and add a dust of flour, moisten 
them with a glass of white wine and a little gravy ; sea- 
ton with salt and pepper ; let them boil a quarter of an 
boor, and thicken the sauce with the yolks of three eggs, 
t little cream, and a pinch of finely minced parsley, let it 
thicken without boiling it. 

This is given as a national dish.

CHAPTER VII. 

PORK. 

The Dames of the various pieced are : 

IN ENGLAND. 

Fore quarter: Spare Rib— Hand — Belly, or Spring. 
Hind Quarter : Fore Loin — Hind Loin, which, if too 
long, a spare rib may be cut ofif — Leg. 

IN SCOTLAND. 

Spare Rib — Breast and Shoulder — Sirloin^ The Ham 

or Gigot. 
The entrails are named the liver, crow, kidney, skirts, 

sometimes called the harslet, also the chitterlings or 

guts. 

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON PORK. 

Dairy- FED pork is the best ; the flesh should look 
white and smooth, and the fat be white and fine. In pre- 
paring a hog for bacon, the ribs are cut, with a very little 
flesh on them, from the side, which has the fore and hind 
leg attached to it ; the hind leg is then called a gammon of 
bacon, but it is generally reserved for a bam. On each 
side there is a large spare rib, which is usually divided into 



PREPARATORY REMARKS. 141 

two, one called the sweet bone, tbe other the blade bone. 
There are also griskiusy chine, or back bone. 

Hog*8 lard is the inner fat of the bacon hog. 

Porkers are not so old as hogs ; they make excellent 
pickled porky but are chosen more particularly for roast- 
ing. 

To roast a leg, a small onion is minced together with 
three sage leaves, seasoned with pepper and salt, and pat 
under the skin at the knuckle bone ; the skin is cut into 
strips nearly half an inch apart^ and rubbed over with a 
bit of butter. If weighing seven or eight pounds, it will 
require neaily three hours to roast. 

A spare rib should be roasted, is basted with butter^ 
and has sage leaves, dried, rubbed to a powder^ and mix. 
ed with salt and pepper, sprinkled over it. ' 

Botb a loin and neck are jointed, the skin scored in nar- 
row strips^ and rubbed with butter. If weighing six or 
seven pounds, it will require rather more than two hours 
to roast. 

A griskin may be either broiled or roasted. 

A chine is stuffed here and there with bread crumbs, 
mixed with a little butter^ and seasoned with some finely- 
shred sage, parsley, and thyme, some pepper and salt. 
The skin is cut into strips, and rubbed with butter ; it is 
then roasted, and served with apple sauce, as are also the 
preceding roasts. 

A porker's head is stuffed like a sucking pig, sewed 
firmly, and hung on a string to roast* 

The shoulder may be roasted, but, being very fat, it is 
generally preferred pickled. 

The breast may be made into a pie, or broiled.

warm water, and scrub it clean ; pare off any rusty part, 
and trim it neatly. Put it on in a large pot, with plenty 
of lukewarm water, and let it simmer for four or five 
hours. Take off the skin as whole as possible ; sift over 
the ham bread raspings and a very little pounded sugar, 
and set it* before the fire for two or three minutes, and

sausi^esy and three or four inches long ; dust them with 



146 POBK. 

a little flour; bftve ready a frying-pan made very hot, and 
fry them without any .thing but their own fat, till they 
are done quite through, taking care not to make them 
too dry. By breaking one of them, the cook will know 
whether they are sufficiently done. They may be fried 
in lard or fresh beef dripping. 

To Cure Pig's Cheek.

TunniDg the knife into the heart ; plunge it for a minute 
ar two into cold water ; rub it over with resin beaten ex- 
ceedingly fine; it is sometimes rubbed with its blood 
kefore the resin is put on ; dip it into a pail of scalding 
'water, take it out and rub off all the hair as quickly as 
yoaaible; if it ahould not all come off, repeat the scalding 
.and rubbing with resin. When quite clean, wash it in 
.variDy and frequently in cold water. Cut off the feet at 
the first joint ; take out all the entrails ; put the pettitoes, 
keart, liver, and lights together. Wash the pig well in 
cold water, and dry it thoroughly. Make a stuffing of 
grated bread, butter, a small onion, and three or four sage 
leamea minced ; season with pepper and salt, put it in- 
akie and sew it up. The pig being made perfectly dry, 
put tfae well- beaten white of an egg all over it with a 
feather. Put it down to roast before a very quick fire, 
and under it a small basin to catch the gravy. Do not 
floor it, and be sure to cover it well with the egg, which 
will rrisp it nicely, and make it of a delicate light brown. 
It will take from one to two hours to roast. When done, 
eat ofiTthe head, part it and the body down the middle ; 
nix with the chopped brains a little 6nely-minced boiled 
lege and some melted butter, add to it the gravy that 
Itts mn from the pig, also mix with the stuffing some 
aielted butter. Lay the pig on the dish, placing the 
thonldor of the one side to the hind quarter of the other*

Salt it eight or ten days, turn and rub it daily. Be 
fore being dressed, let it lie in cold water for half ai 
hour; put it on in cold water; when it boils, take offth 
scum, and let it simmer till done. If weighing seve 
or eight pounds, it will take nearly three hours to boi 
Serve with peas-pudding and boiled greens. About tw 
or three pounds of pickled pork will require to be sim 
mered for an horn* and a half. 

Pork Steaks. 

Cut them off a neck or loin, trim them neatly, an 
pepper them ; broil them over a clear fire, turning thei 
frequently; they will take twenty minutes. Sprinkl 
'them with a litUe salt before serving. 

Black Puddings. 

Throw a little salt into the blood while it is warir 
and stir it till it become cold ; boil in milk till quite ten 
der two quarts of half grits. When nearly cold, put i

whofe in a Dutch oven, or cut them into slices, and broil 
them upon a gridiron, or they may be put into the skins. 

To Dress the Blood of Pigs, Calves, or 
^ Lambs without Skins. 

Cut an onion in small dice, and put it into a sauce-pan

and salt, and stir it gently on the fire as buttered eggs are 
done. 

A Collar of Brawn. 

Wash, scrape, and clean very thoroughly a large pig's 
head, feet, and ears; lay them into salt-and- water, with a 
Httle saltpetre, for three hours. To make the collar larger^ 
lioU two ox-heels, with the head, feet, and ears, till all the 
bonea can be taken out easily, then put the head round 
^ moold, and the feet and small pieces into the middle; 
put it together while hot, and press it with a heavy weight 



ISO i>orb:. 

tin it become cold. Boil for half an hour, in td much 
of the liquor as will corer the brawny one handful of salt^ 
one ounce of pepper, black and white mixed, and one or 
two bay leaves. When cold^ ponr it oyer thd brawn. 

Mock Brawn. 

Take the blade bone out of the shoulder, and boil it 
gently two hours or more, according to the age of the 
boar. When it is cold, season it very highly with black 
pepper, eayenne, salt, a very little allspice, minced onion, 
and thyme. Let it lie a night in this seasoning; the follow* 
ing day, make a savoury forcemeat of pounded veal, ham, 
beef suet, minced parsley, thyme, and an onion, a little 
lemon-peel, salt, nutmeg, white pepper, and cayenne; 
Innd it with an egg beaten, and stuff where the bone has 
been taken out. Pat it into a deep pan with the brown 
aide downwards^ and lay under it twigs or small sticks, 
to keep it from sticking to the bottom ; pour in a bottle of 
beer, and put it into the oven. When nearly done, take it 
out and clear off all the fat, add a bottle of madeira and 
the juice of a large lemon, return it to the oven, and bake 
it till it become as tender as a jelly, so that a straw will 
pierce it easily. If the boar is an old one, it will require 
to be baked six or seven hours. This dish is eaten hot. 

To Stew Pig's Feet. 

Cl^BAN them well, and boil them till they are tender. 
Brown some butter with flour, and add it to a quantity 
of gravy or water sufficient to stew the feet in. Season 
with a minced onion, three sage leaves, salt, and black 
and Jamaica pepper. Cut the feet into two, add them and 
cover the pan closely; let them stew half an hour. A

leavtes minoed ; and having split the feet into two, and 
them, and when they become tender, mix in a tea-spoon- 
fa] of vinegar. Serve the mince with the pettitoes upon 
it, and garnish with sippets of bread. 

Pork Cheese. 

Choose the head of a small pig which may weigh 
about twelve pounds the quarter. Sprinkle over it and 
the tongues of four pigs, a little common salt and a very 
little saltpetre. Let them lie four days, wash them, and 
tie them in a clean cloth ; boil them until the bones will 
come easily out of the head, take off the skin as whole 
as possible, place a bowl in hot water and put in the head^ 
€atting it into small pieces. In the bottom of around tin^ 
afaaped like a small cheese, lay two strips of cloth across 
etuii other — ^they must be long enough to fold over the 
top when the shape is full — place the skin round the tin, 
and nearly half fill it with the meat, which has been high- 
ly seasoned with black pepper, cayenne, and salt ; put in 
some tongue cut into slices, then the rest of the meat and 
' the remainder of the tongue, draw the cloth tightly across 
the top ; put on it a board or a plate that will fit into the 
shape, and place on it a heavy weight, which must not 
be taken off till it be quite cold. It is eaten with vinegar 
and mustard, and served for luncheon or supper. 

To Stew a Ham. 

Soak the ham in lukewarm water for twelve hours, 
dndn it, and scrape the rind ; put it into a stew-pan with 
some slices of fat bacon round the sides, four quarts of 
weak stock, a good deal of parsley, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
six laige onions, four carrots^ a little allspice and black 
pepper, a pint of madeira, and one of port wine. Cover 
the ham with slices of fat bacon, and put over it a sheet 
of white paper ; stew it eight hours, or ten if it be a very 
large ham. Before serving, take off the rind, strain the 
sauce, skim it well, and boil it till reduced to a glaze, and 
pour it round the ham, or serve it with any other sauce 
that may be preferred. 



152 roRK. 

To Prepare the Fat of Bacon for Larding. 

Cut the fat from the pork, rub it with salt, allowing 
one pound of salt to every ten pounds of lard. Put it in 
a cellar on a board, laying one piece upon another, put a 
board on the top, and stones upon the board to firm the 
lard ; when it Ims lain at least a fortnight in salt, hang it 
up in a dry place. 

Bacon. 

For one side of a large pig allow one pound of coarse 
common salt, the same quantity of coarse brown sugar, 
two ounces of saltpetre, and two of rock salt finely pound- 
ed. Mix them well, and rub it on both sides of the pork, 
and when all is rubbed in, then lay it upon a wooden 
table placed slopingly, and pnt on it a board and weight. 
Place under it a Tessel to catch the brine. Turn it once 
in two or three days, and baste it with the brine. Let it 
remain in this way for three weeks, and then hang it up to 
smoke for twenty^fbur hours, which will be a sufficient 
length of timci if the smoke is powerful. 



POULTRY. 153 



CHAPTER VIII. 
POULTRY. 

PBXPARATORY REMARKS ON POULTRY. 

In choosing a turkey^ the young cock bird is to be pre- 
ferred ; the best, have black legs, and if young, the toes 
and bOl are pliable and feel soft. A hen turkey is chosen 
by the same rules. 

Fowls with black legs are the best: if fresh, the vent 
is close and dark ; if young, the combs are br^ht in the 
colour, and the legs smooth — the spurs of a young cock 
are short. 

A goose, if young and fine, is plump in the breast, the 
ht white and soft, the feet yellow, and but few hairs upon 
them. 

Ducks may be chosen by the same rules, and are hard 
and thick on the breast and belly. *' 

Pigeons should be quite fresh, the breast plump and 
fat, the feet elastic^ and neither flabby nor discoloured at 
the vent. 

To prepare a turkey for dressing, every plug is care- 
fully picked out ; and in drawing tm'keys and fowls, care 
must be taken not to break the gall bag, nor the gut 
which joins the gizzard, as it is impossible to remove the 
bitterness of the one, or the grittlness of the other. The 



154 POULTRY, 

faairs are singed off with white paper ; the leg-bone is 
broken close to the foot, and the sinews drawn out — a 
€loth is then put over the breast, and the bone flattened 
with a rolling pin, the liver and gizzard, made delicately 
clean, are fastened into each pinion. A stuffing made with 
sausage meat, adding some grated breads and mixing it 
with the beaten yolks of two eggs, or a stuffing as for a 
fillet of veal, is then put into the breast, and the turkey, 
well rubbed over with flour, is put down to roast. It is 
basted constantly with butter, and when the steam draws 
towards the fire, it is nearly done ; — ^it is then dredged 
with flour, and basted with more butter, served with 
gravy in the dish, and garnished with sausages, or with 
forcemeat balls (if veal stuffing is used), and bread sauce 
in a sauce tureen. 

To boil a turkfy. After being nicely cleaned, it is 
trussed with the legs drawn in under the skin, stuffed 
with a forcemeat, as for veal, adding a few chopped 
oysters ; then boiled in a well-floured cloth, and served 
with oyster, white, or celery sauce, poured over it, and 
also some in a sauce tureen. Boiled ham, tongue, or 
pickled pork, is eaten with it. A large-sized turkey will 
nooire more than two hours to boil. Turkey, with ce- 
lery sauce, is stuffed and trussed neatly, laid all over with 
slices of bacon, tied in a cloth, and boiled in water, with 
a little salt, butter, and lemon juice added. It is served 
thickly covered with celery sauce. 

Turkey poults are stuffed and roasted in the same 
manner as a full-grown turkey. They will require rather

To roast a fowl. It is picked, nicely cleaned, and 
ainged ; the neck is cnt off close by the back ; the fowl is 
then washed^ and, if a large one, stuffed with forcemeat. 
It is trussed and dredged with flour ; and when put down 
to roast, basted well with butter, and frothed up. When 
the steam is observed to draw towards the fire, it is suf- 
ficiently done ; served with gravy in the dish, and bread 
aauce in a butter tureen. A good>sized fowl will require 
above an hour to roast. 

Chickens are roasted as the above, and served with 
gravy in the dish, which is garnished with fried eggs, 
and bread sauce in a sauce tureen ; they will require from 
half an hour to three quarters to roast. 

To boil a fowl. When nicely singed, washed, and 
bussed, it is well dredged with flour, and put on in boil- 
ing water, and if a large one, boiled nearly an hour. It 
is served with parsley and butter, white, or liver sauce. 

Two boiled fowls^ served with a tongue between them, 
make a handsome top dish. 

Boiled chickens are improved by being stuffed, and will 
leqnire nearly half an hour to boil. 

To roast a goose. After being well cleaned, picked, 
and singed, it is washed, made perfectly dry^ and stuffed 
with about four table-spoonfuls of grated bread, an onion 
finely minced, together with three sage leaves, seasoned 
with salt and pepper, and mixed with a well-beaten egg ; 
or tbe stuffing is made of boiled mashed potatoes, seasoned 
in the same way as the other, and mixed with a beaten 
egg. If roasted on a spit, each end is tied on tightly ; it is 
bested at first with a little bit of butter, after which the 
fat that drops from it is used. It is served with gravy

goose will require an hour and a half to roast. At table, 
aa opening is cut in the apron, and a glass of port wine^ 
with which is mixed a large tea-spoonful of made mui(- 
tard, is poured into the body of the goose. This is also 
an improvement to ducks. When a goose is too old for 
the spit, it may be made into a ham, preparing it as for 
boilings and following the same rules as for pork hams. 

A green goose, about two or three months old, is sea- 
soned with pepper and salt only, and requires to be basted 
with butter. It requires about an hoar to roast. 

To roast ducks. They are nicely picked, cleaned, 
smged, and washed, seasoned with pepper and salt ; or

grated bread, four well-beaten eggs, and half a pint of rich 
sweet cream ; season with black and Jamaica pepper, 
mace, and salt ; mix it all well together ; let it stand for 
half an hour, and then put it into the goose, which sew 
up, and make it of as natural a form as possible ; but take 
care that it be not too much stuffed* Boil it for half an 
hour in some good stock, and then put it into a flat tin 
baking-pan, with some fresh butter over and under it. 
Bake it in an oven another half hour, and serve it with

with flonr, add about a pint of the stock in which the 
goose has been boiled, three mted onions, two table- 
apoonfhls of capers cut fine, a little lemon pickle, and a 
Ipw small pickled onions ; boil it about a quarter of an 
htmr, and, just before pouring it over the goose, stir in 
gnuiually half a pint of rich cream. 

When this dish is to be served cold, the fat being care* 
fully removed from the goose, it may be ornamented or 
tovered with cold jelly made as follows : Boil for five 
hours in four quarts of water the bones of the goose, with 
tbnee nicely-cleaned calf's feet ; strain it, and when cold, 
take off all the fat, and boil the jelly with some whole 
black and Jamaica pepper, ginger, and salt ; add two 
dunces of dissolved isinglas, the juice of two lemons, and

To Preserve Eggs. 

Pour a gallon of water over a pound of unslaked lime, 
stir it well ; the following day, pour off the clear water 
into a jar, and put in the eggs as they are laid. In this 
manner they will continue perfectly good for six months 
or more. 

To know when eggs are fresh, hold them to a light ; if 
they are transparent and clear, it is a good sign ; if they 
are pricked, they may be considered old ; if they have a 
stain attached to the shell, they are good for nothing.

CURRIES. 



Clime. 

Cut a fowl into small pieces^ skin it, and let it blanch 
in cold water for two hours ; mince an onion yery small, 
and put it into a sauce-pan, with two ounces of hatter, 
and a large table-spoonful of flour of rice stirred in by de- 
grees ; brown it well, and when just boiling, add a quart 
of cold water, with the pieces of fowl and a large table- 
spoonful of currie powder mixed in it. Let it boil till 
the fowl be quite tender, and just before serving, squeeze 
the juice of half a lemon oyer the blade of a hot knife in- 
to it. Vinegar will answer instead of the juice ; and if it 
be required very fine", in place of rice, thicken it with an 
ounce of sweet almonds blanched and pounded. 

Currie of Veal. 

Cut part of a ne^ of yeal into cutlets, and make a 
grayy of the trimmings ; season it with pepper, salt, and 
an onion ; strain and thicken it with flour and butter, and 
add two spoonfuls of currie powder. Fry the cutlets with 
an onion minced yery small, in butter, of a light brown 
<^lour, and then stew them in the prepared grayy till they 
beeome quite tender. Before serving, add the juice of 
half a lemon, and a little Chili pepper. 






CURRIES* 171 

A Dry Currie. 

Skik and cat a fowl into joints, or take off small cuU 
let* from the best end of a neck of veal ; fry in butter 
diree or four minced onions, and drain them ; then fry the 
lovrl or veal, and dust it wilJi three tea-spoonfuls of currie 
powder, and a quarter of a tea-spoonfal of cayenne. Put 
the fried meat and onions into a stew-pan, with a little 
aalt, half a pint of milk, and the same quantity of water 
keep the pan closely corered, and let it stew tiU perfect- 
ly tender, and ten minst^s before seridng, add two tea- 
spoonfuls of lemon juice. 

Currie Pimento. 

Having skinned and cut a fowl into joints, and rub* 
bed it well with currie powder, and a little cayenne, stew 
it gently, and tiU very tender, in some well-seasoned Teal 
«r Rivttoa broth, to which some whole rice is added with 
ihik l»w] ; and before serring, mix in a little lemon juice 

Kebobbed Currie. 

Cut into small bits, veal, or the meat of fowl, and pick<* 
led pofk, and, with slices of onion, fasten them alternately 
upon small skewers, three or four inches long. Pound 
IB a mortar a couple of onions, a small apple, a head of

fish, and stew all together till it be quite tender. S] 
make a good currie, but should be stewed in less wai 

Cold Fish Currie. 

Cut into round thick slices cold boiled salmon, s 
cod, or haddocks; fry them in butter. In as much ^ 
gar as will cover the fish, boil a little salt, two or t 
cloves of garlic, a good deal of turmeric finely poun 
three cloves, a little nutmeg, ginger, and black pe

FKIPA&ATOET SBMARKS OIT OAMK. 

In chooOTUg ▼enison, the fat of tlist whoA U good is 
tUdc, e^etTf toad bright ; the clift part smooth and dose. 
Wibem tfae wemmm is perfocdy freth^ it is hong in a cool 
plaee, aad earefdUy' wiped diy every day. When ex* 
treme tenderness is required from l<mg keeping, but 
without its having a high iavonr^ it is well nibbed over 
with powdered charcoal. 

The hamch is the prime joint, and when it is required 
to he roasted, it is first well washed in lokewarm milk- 
and-water, and then made quite dry before it is spitted* 
It is then eoyered with a sheet of weU*buttered white 
, over which is laid a coarse paste of flour-and-water, 
a ipiarter of an inch thick ; this is again covered 
with hsttered white paper, and tied on with packthread. 
A flvhataatial fire being made, the haonch is put down, 
and constantly basted with fresh beef dripping, till nearly 
done, when the paste is taken off, ihe meat well basted 
wUtk butter, aad lightly dredged with flour, till it froths 
and becoi i of a fine light brown colour. It is served 



176 GAME* 

with its own gravy in the dishi if there he enough of it ; 
also a sance tureen of good hrown gravy, and one of cur- 
rant jelly sauce heat up, and melted with a little port 
wine and sugar. 

A large haunch takes ahout four hours to roast. 

A neck and shoulder, when roasted, is managed in the 
same way as the haunch, omitting the paste ; hut it is 
more frequently used for soups, pasties, and col lops. 

Hare. When fresh, the hody is stiff; and if youngs 
the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears tender and 
easily torn. Hares are kept from a week to a fortnight 
for roastii\g ; hut for soup, they cannot have been too re- 
cently killed. 

Rabbits are chosen by the same rules as hares* 

Wild fowl, in genera], is chosen by the same rules as 
tame poultry. Tbo birds should be plnmp and fat, and 
hard in the vent. If the skin comes off when rubbed 
hard with the finger, they are stale. Old birds improve 
by keeping for some time ; young birds are best if dress- 
ed soon ; and small birds, of all. descriptions, should be 
immediately dressed. In warm weather, a stopper of 
charcoal should be put into the vent of all game, and a 
^tring tied tightly round the neck. 

To roast pheasants and partridges, they are picked, 
cleaned, and nicely singed ; a slit is made in the back 
part of the neck, and the eraw taken out, leaving on the 
head, the feet twisted closely to the body, the claws cut 
off, and the head turned under the wing. Both sorts are 
roasted by the directions for roasting a turkey or a iowL 
A pheasant is served with gravy in the dish ; partridges, 
ivith a gravy, or laid upon battered toast, and melted 
butter poured round them. Bread sauce is served with 



PREPARATORY REMARKS. 177 

both. A pheaaanf will require nearly an honr to roast ; 
parlrtdgea half an honr^ Gninea and pea-fowl are roast- 
ed in the same way as pheasants. 

To roast hlack-cock, follow the directions for roasting 
pheasants and partridges ; it will require an honr, and ia 
served with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce in a sauce 
tnreen. 

Moorfowl are roasted in the same manner, and reqiure 
three qoarters of an hour. They may be served upoa 
buttered toast^ or with gravy in the dish, and bread sauce* 
in a aance tnreen. It improves moorfowl and partridges 
to put a bit of butter into them, when trussing them for 
roasting ; and sometimes a bit of fresh undressed beef is 
tubstitnted for the butter, wliich is taken out before- 
terving. 

. Ta restore tainted game or poultry, pick it carefully, 
dean, and wash it, then put into each bird a little newly- 
nade pounded charcoal, tied in a bit of muslin. Before 
tervingy take out the bag, which will have a most o£fen> 
fiive smelly while the bird will be left perfectly sweet. 

Tq roast a wild-duck. It should be roasted by a quick 
frCf well basted with butter, and browned. It will re- 
quire nearly three quarters of an hour, and when to be 
served, some beef gravy is poured through the duck into 
the dish, and in a sauce tureen some hot port wine is 
served. The carver makes four cuts along the breast, it 
is then sprinkled with salt and a little cayenne, the juice 
of half a lemon is squeezed over it, and the pprt wine is 
then ponred over all. 

To roast a wild-goose, the same directions are follow- 
ed as for a wild-duck, allowing more time to roast it ac- 
cording to the size of the bird.

tlte wild-duek, and are roasted in ten miniites, and may 
be served upon fried bread cnimbs. 

Woodcocks and snipes are roasted without being drawn ; 
a piece of toasted bread buttered is pnt under each bird^ 
to catch the trail ; they aie weil basted with batter, and 
served upon the hot toast over which they were roasted ; 
m rich brown gravy, or melted butter, is poured round 
them. Woodcocks will require half an hour^ snipes and 
quta^ fifteen or twenty minutes, to roast. 

Ortolans and green plovers are not drawn, and are 
roasted and served in the same manner as woodcocks. 

To roast larks, wheatears, and other small birds, they 
are nicely picked, gutted, cleaned, and trussed ; brushed 
over with melted butter, and rolled in grated bread, thea 
^tted on a bird spit, which is fastened upon a larger one. 
They are basted with butter^ and sprinkled with some 
bread crumbs. They will require nearly fifteen minutefr 
to roast, and are served upon fried bread crumbs, and 
brown gravy in a sauce tureen. 

Wild pigeons may be roasted, or made into a pie. 

Plovers' eggs are boiled hard, and served in a napkin^ 
or with green moss put round each in the dish. 



To Stew Moorfowl. 

Truss them, keeping on their heads, but draw the legs 
within the body ; mix well some salt and pepper with 
fiour and a piece of butter, and put a small bit into each 
bird ; fry them all over of a nice brown in butter. Brown 
some butter and flour, and add to it some good gravy,

'MatOBed nidi pepper, salty mace, and two cIoFes pound* 
€d ; boil «p the sauce, put in the moorfowl, and let tbem 
stew very slowly till tender. A littte before taking them 
off tbe foe^ add a table-spoonful of mushroom catsup. If 
the birds are old, stew them for two hours ; if young 
ones, half that time. 

Cold roasted moorfowl are dressed exactly in the same 
ilay» only cut into joints, and stewed very gently nearly as 
long. Half an hour before serring, a small tea-cupfid of 
port wine should be added. 

To Stew a Hare. 

Cut a hare into pieces^ put it into a sance-paa^ with 
half a pint of port wine, the same of good gravy, and a pint 
of cider, two or three small onions, a quarter of a pound 
i)i butter, some salt and pepper. Let it all stew till the 
Jbare be quite tender, and the liquor a good deal re- 
4hwed» 

Another way to Stew a Hare. 

BoKE a hare ; make a sauce with the bones and a lit- 
tie beef stock, adding sweet herbs, spices, and some port 
wine ; thicken it with browned butter and flour. Stuff 
tbe hare with forcemeat, or with equal quantities of 
minced mutton and suet^ well seasoned ; put it into the 
boiling sauce, and let it stew two hours. Place the hare 
on a dish, and strain the sauce over it. 

To Roast and Stuff a Hare, 

^BSK the hare is skinned and cleaned, lay it into cold 
-water for three or four hours, changing the water several 
times, then rub it well with a little salt, and wash it tho- 
roughly ; dry it well. Make a stufling «f the raw liver 
minced, by no means parboiled, grated bread crumbs, 
twice the quantity of chopped fat bacon, and a bit of 
Wtter ; aeason with grated nutmeg, lemon thyme, lemon* 
peel, pepper, and salt ; an anchovy may be added ; bind 
with a beaten egg, put it into the hare, sew it up, and 
truss it properly. Put into the dripping-pan warm salt- 



180 GAME. 

find-water, baste the hare well till all the blood be out of 
it, pour away the water, and put in a quart of milk, with 
which it must be constantly basted till it be nearly done ; 
then baste and froth it with butter. Serve with gravy, 
and, in a butter tureen, currant jelly sauce. 

Hashed Hare. 

Cut it into small pieces, heat it thoroughly in highly 
seasoned gravy, adding, with the stuffing, a tea-spoonful 
of vinegar, and a glass of port wine. The legs may be 
scored, seasoned with pepper and salt, rubbed with cold 
butter, and broiled. They may be served with the hash, 
or on a separate dish. 

Stewed Hare. 

Cut off all the tneat, in small pieces ; make a strong 
gravy with the bones of the hare, a bunch of sweet herbs, 
and two onions ; strain it, and put in the hare, with two 
table-spoonfuls of port wine, two or three thin bits of 
bacon, a little salt, mace, and a clove pounded. Cover 
it closely, and let it stew two hours, and if the gravy is 
much reduced, add a little more. 

Florendine Hare. 

After a hai*e has hung a week, prepare it as for 
roasting, and take out all the bones of the body, leaving 
the head whole ; making a stuffing as before directed, lay 
it over the inside of the hare, roll it up, sew it, and fas- 
ten it with packthread ; roll it into a cloth, and boil it 
in two quarts of water an hour and a half. When the 
liquor is reduced to a quart, add a pint of port wine, and of 
lemon pickle and mushroom catsup, a table-spoonful each, 
also a tea-spoonfol of broivning ; thicken it with flour and 
butter, and sth: it till reduced a little. Serve with force- 
meat balls, morels, and mushrooms ; make the ears lie 
back upon the roll, and garnish with barberries and curled 
parsley. 



GAME. 181 

Hare and Venison CoUops* 

Thbsb are dressed in the same manner as mince col- 
lope of berf, only that, in place of the seasoning of the 
coUops of beef, they hare a little Jamaica pepper, salt, and 
some port wine. 

To Hash Venison. 

For a gravy, boil a part of the bone and trimmings of 
the cx>ld haonch in a little water ; season with a few pep- 
pereoms and some salt ; strain and thicken it with a bit 
of butter rolled in flour, add a glass of port wine, and a ta-

Truss the partridges as fowls are done for boiling ; 
pound the livers with double the quantity of fat bacon 
and bread crumbs boiled in milk; add some chop|>ed 
paniey, thyme, shalots, and mushrooms; season with 
pepper, salt, grated lemon-peel, and mace. Stuff the in* 
side of the birds, tie them at both ends^ and put them 
into a stew-pan lined with slices of bacon ; add a quart

faonch of sweet herbs, and a few blades of mace; let 
tbem stew gently till tender ; take them out^ strain and 
thicken the sauce with flour and butter, make it hot, and 
poor it over the partridges. 

To Stew Young Partridges. 

Truss them as for roasting, stuff the craws with force- 
meat ; lard down each side of the breast, roll a lump of 
batter in pepper, and salt, and beaten mace, put it into 
the inside of each bird, and sew it up ; dredge them with

and Fery little of it senres for colooring soopt, gravies, or 



To clarify batter. Pot tbe butter cot into slices into 
a nicely-cleaned brass pan, stir it gently till dissolved ; 
when it boils, draw the pan to tbe side of the fire, skim 
it, and let it boil gently a second time, and if any acaai 
again rises, take it off; let it settle for two or three mi- 
noles, and strain it gently through a sieve which has a 
piece of muslin laid into it. 

Fresh beef suet, picked free from skin and sinews, Is 
dissolved in tbe same way ; it is then strained through 



PEAVIES, SAUCES, &C. 185 

muslin into small jars, and when cold, covered with blad- 
der, or it may be strained into cold water ; and the cake 
when cold, wiped dry, folded in white paper^ and kept in 
a linen bag* 

Beef snet will keep fresh for some time if finely chop- 
ped and dredged well with flour, and kept in white paper 
bags in a cool place. 

Beef and mutton drippings are clarified exactly in the 
manner butter is done, and each kept in a separate jar. 

To melt hog's lard, put it into a jar placed in a pot of 
water, or water bath, strain it into clean bladders or small 
jarsy and cover them with paper. Thus prepared, it will 
keep a good length of time, and is the best thing for fry- 
ii^ fish ill. 

To fry parsley, wash it, pick it clean, and put it into 
finesb cold water ; take it out, and then throw it into boil- 
ing lard or dripping, when it will instantly become crisp ; 
it 18 then taken out with a slice. 



White Roux, or White Thickening for 
Sauces and Made Dishes. 

Melt gradually, over a slow fire, a good piece of but- 
ter, and dredge in a sufficiency of flour to make it like a 
thin paste 4 keep stirring it for a quarter of an hour, and 
then pat it into a small jar to be kept for use. 

Brown Roux, or Thickening. 

Put into a nicely-tinned sauce-pan about a pound of 
fresh butter, melt it slowly, and dredge in flour till it 



186 OSAYIES, SAUCES, &e4 

becomes Hke a paste, carefolly stirriiig it all the time, put 
it for a^few mistttes npon a quick fire, and then return it 
to where there is less heat, and stir it till it assumes a 
light brown colour, when it may be put into a jar. 
These thickenings keep for some time. 

Gravy made from Bones. 

Break into small pieces a pound of beef, mutton, or 
Teal bones, if mixed together so much the better ; boil 
them in two quarts of water, and after it boils^ let it sim- 
mer for nearly three hours ; boil with it a couple of onions, 
a bunch of sweet herbs, some salt and pepper ; strain, and 
keep it for making gravy or sauces. 

The bones of broiled or roasted meat being scraped, 
washed clean, and boiled in less water, answer eqiudly 
well for this purpose. 

To make Gravy. 

Cut down into slices four pounds of lean beef, mb the 
bottom of the pot with butter, and put in the meat ; turn 
it frequently till it be well browned, and do it slowly, then 
add four quarts of cold water ; when it has boiled two 
hours, put in a dessert-spoonful of whole black pepper, 
and the same of Jamaica pepper, one carrot, and three 
onions ; let it stew gently for four hours longer, strain it, 
and when it is required for use, take off the fat. This 
gravy answers for all made dishes when brown gravy 
sauce is used. 

Another way to make Gravy. 

Dip a beef liver into water, wipe it, and rub over it 
iMnne salt and coarse brown sugar ; let it lie seven or eight 
days, turning it frequently ; boil, in as much water as will 
quite cover the liver, one ounce of saltpetre, and three 
of common salt ; wipe the liver dry, and put it into the 
pickle ; let it lie for six weeks, then hang it to dry. Boil 
for an hour and a half, in a pint of water, a slice of this

place. 

Another way to Preserve Green Peas. 

Put into a sauce-pan of boiling water fresh-gathered 
and fresh-shelled peas, but not very young ; as soon as 
they boil up, pour ofl^ the water, and put them upon a 
large dry cloth folded, and then upon another, that they

To Keep French Beans for Winter Use. 

Gather them when young, and on a dry day, pat a 
layer of salt into a jar, and then one of about two inches 
tbick of beans ; do this till the jar be nearly full ; place 
a small plate upon the top of them, and tie bladder close- 
ly over the jar ; keep it in a cool dry place. When to be 
used, soak them a night in cold water, and change it on 
them repeatedly in the course of the day they are to be 
dressed. Cut them, and put them on in boiling water. 

To Make Sour Krout. 

The best cabbage for this purpose is the drum, or 
white Strasburg, and it should not be used till it has 
endured some severe frost ; the stocks are then cut into 
halves, and shred down as fine as possible with a knife, 
or more properly with a plane made in the form of a cu- 
cumber slice. Bum a little juniper in a cask or tub 
which is perfectly sound and clean, and put a little lea- 
ven into the seam round the bottom, — flour and vinegar 
may be substituted for leaven ; then put in three or four 
handfuls of cabbage, a good sprinkling of salt, and a tea- 
spoonful of caraway seed, and press this hard with a 
wooden mallet ; next add another layer of cabbage, with 
salt and caraway seed, as at first ; and so on in the same 
manner until the cask be full, pressing down each layer 
firmly as you advance. A good deal of water will come 
to the top, of which a part may be taken off. The cask 
being full, put on the head so as to press upon the cab- 
bage, and place it in a warm cellar to ferment ; when it 
has workad well for three weeks, take off the scum which 
' will have gathered on the top, and lay a clean cloth on 
the krout ; replace the head, and put two or three heavy 
stones upon it. The juice should always stand upon the 
top. Thus, in a good cellar, it will keep for years.

FUDDINGSj PIES, AND TARTS. 229 



CHAPTER XIII. 
PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. 

PREPARATORY REMARKS. 

Great nicety is to be observed ia preparing every 
material used for boiled or baked puddings* 

The eggs require to be well beaten, for wbieh purpose, 
if many are to be done, a whisk is used ; if few, » three- 
pronged fork. The flour is dried and sifted. The cur- 
rants are carefully cleaned, by putting them into a cul* 
lender, and pouring warm water over them ; if very dirty, 
this is to be repeated two or three times, and after being 
chried in a dish before the fire, they are rubbed in a clean 
coarse cloth, all the stalks and stones picked out, and 
then a little flour dredged over them. The raisins are 
stoned with a small sharp-pointed knife ; it is cleansed in 
a basia of water^ which also receives the seed. The 
pndding-cloth must be k^pt especially clean, or it will 
impart an unpleasant taste to any thing that is boiled in 
it ; and when taken off a pudding, it ought immediately 
to be laid into cold water, and afterwards well washed 
with soda or pearl-ashes in hot water. Just before being 
used for a rice, bread, or batter pudding, it should be 
dipped into hot water, wrung, shaken, and well dredged 
with flour ; and for a plum, suet pudding, or any sort of 



^30 PUDDINGS, WES, AND TARTS. 

fruit pudding in paste, it must be buttered before being 
floured. 

All puddings in paste are tied tightly, but oQier pud- 
dings loosely^ in the cloth. When a pudding is to be boiled 
in a shape, a piece of buttered white paper is put upon the 
top of it before the floured cloth is tied on. The pan, dish, 
or shape, in which a pudding is to be either boiled or baked, 
must always be buttered before it is filled. It is an im- 
provement to puddings in general to let them stand some 
time after being prepared either for boiling or baking. 
When a pudding is to be boiled, it must be put on in a 
covered pot, in plenty of boiling water, and never for a 
moment be allowed to be off the boil tmtil ready to be 
served. As the water wastes, more, and always boiling, 
must be added. A plum pudding is the better for being 
mixed the day before it is to be boiled. It may be useful 
to observe that this pudding will keep for months after 
it is dressed, if the cloth be allowed to remain upon it, 
and if, when cold, it be covered with a sheet of foolscap 
paper, and then htmg up in a cool place. When about to 
be used, it must be put into a clean cloth, and again boiI» 
ed for an hour ; or it may be cut into slices, and broiled 
ais wanted. If in breaking eggs, a bad one should acci* 
dentally drop into the basin amongst the rest, the whol& 
will be spoiled ; and therefore they should be broken one 
by one into a tea-cup. When the whites only of eggs are 
required for jelly, or other things, the yolks, if not broken, 
will keep good for two or three days, if the basin they 
are in be covered. 

A alab of marble, stone, or slate, is preferable to wood^ 
for rolling out paste on. The rolling-pin, cutters^ and 
every other implement used in these processes, must be 
kept particularly clean ; they should always be washed 



PBEPABATORT REMARKS. 231 

immediately after being used, and then well dried. Before 
using batter for paste^ it is laid for some time into cold 
trater^ which is changed once or twice. When salt butter 
is used, it is well worked in two or three waters. If it 
should not be convenient to make the paste immediately 
before it it baked, it will not suffer from standing, if made 
eaiiy in the morning, and the air excluded from it^ by 
pfutting first a tin cover over the pie or tartlets, and above 
that a folded tablecloth. To ascertain if the oven be of 
a proper beat, a little bit of paste may be baked in it, 
heiore any thing else be put in. Puff paste requires rather 
a brisk oven. If too hot, it binds the surface and pre- 
vents the steam from rising ; and if too slow, it becomes 
sodden and flat. Raised crusts require a quick oven; 
fsaSs and tartlets, which are filled with pviBMed fruit, are 
sufficiently done when the paste is baked. When large 
pies have been in the oven for a few minutes, a paper is 
put over them to prevent their being burned. ^ 

Cheese cakes, queen cakes, spunge biscuits, and small 
spuoge cakes, require a quick oven till they have risen . 
afterwards the heat should be more moderate. Plum, seed 
cakes, and all large kinds, must be well soaked, and there- 
fore do not require a brisk oven. To preserve their colour, 
a sheet of white paper is put over them, and after they bave 
iisen and become firm, they are turned round. To ascer- 
tain if a large cake be sufficiently done, a broad-bladed 
kiufe is plunged into the centre of it, and if dry and clean 
when drawn out, the cake is baked ; but if any thing ad- 
iieies to the blade, it must instantly be returned to the 
oven, and the door closed. When the oven is too hot, it 
is better to lessen the fire than to open the door. 



S32 PUDDINGS, PIES, AND TARTS. 

Puff Paste. 

Weigh an equal quantity of flour and butter, rub ra- 
tber more than the half of the flour into one-third of the 
butter, then add as much cold water as will make it into 
a stiff paste ; work it until the butter be completely mix- 
ed with the flour, make it round, beat it with the rollings 
pin, dust it, as also the rolling-pin, with flour, and roll it 
out towards the opposite side of the slab, or paste-board, 
making it of an equal thickness ; then with the point of 
a knife put little bits of butter all over it, dust flour over 
and* under it, fold in the sides and roll it up, dust it again 
with flour, beat it a little, and roll it out, always rubbing 
the rolling-pin with flour, and throwing some underneath 
the paste, to prevent its sticking to the board. If the 
bntt^ is not all easily put in at the second time of roll- 
ing out the paste, the remainder may be put in at the 
third ; it e^gpUbe touched as little as possible with the 
hands. 'v? 

Another Puff Paste. 

Make nearly aD the flour into a stiff paste with cold 
water, knead it well, and divide it into two, roll out each 
piece rather more than a quarter of an ^ich thick ; take 
the butter out of the water, and with the hands put it out 
into a cake or flat piece, flour one piece of the paste, lay 
on it the butter, which is then floured and covered with 
the other piece of paste ; flatten it a little with the roll- 
iDg-piDy and then roll it out, dusting the paste and the pin 
with flour before and after rolling, fold in the sides, roll 
it up, and repeat the rolling out, folding up, and dusting 
with flour, till the butter is incorporated thoroughly with 
he paste. 

Puff paste, if good, will rise into blisters in the course 
of rolling it out ; it may be made with three quarters of 
a pound of butter to one of flour ; the flour should be 
dried, and is the better for being sifted. When the paste

Teal, and pork, if not previously dressed, will be found to 
yield a suffidency of gravy^ and the pie will be better 
without any additional liquid.

Oatmeal Porridge. 

Boil some water in a sauce-pan with a little salt, and 
stir oatmeal into it with a thevil ; when of a proper thick- 
ness^ let it boil for four or five minutes, stirring it all the 
time ; then pour it into a dish, and serve it with cream or 
milk. It is sometimes eaten with porter and sugar, or ale 
and sugar. 

If made with milk instead of water, less meal is requi- 
site, and it is then eaten with cold milk. 

Sowens. 

Half-fill a tub, large jar, or any other vessel, with 
oatmeal seeds, and fill it up with milk-warm water. Let 
it stand till it get a little sour, which in warm weather may 
be in three or four days ; then strain it through a cheese* 
drainer, squeezing the seeds, and adding to them a little 
cold water to obtain all the substance from them ; th^ 
liquid is allowed to stand a little, till the thick matter falls 
to the bottom, the thin is then poured oif, and fresh cold 
water added, stirring it well. The sowens^ being thus 
prepared for boiling, will keep a week or more in cold 
weather; and when too sour for use, a little may be mixed 
with the next making, by which means it will be sooner 
ready. When to be dressed, pour off some of the water 
from the top, stir it up firom the bottom, and boil the por- 
tion required, adding a little salt, and stirring it all the 
time it is upon the fire ; it will take from ten to twenty mi- 
nutes to thicken, when it is poured into a deep dish, and 
jnilk served with it.

large round cakes. Do them in a frying-pan, and serve 
than hot. They are eaten with butter. 

Parkin, or Leeds Gingerbread. 

Sift four pounds of oatmeal, and mix with it four 
pounds of treacle, half a pound of broivfi sugar, the same 
quantity of melted butter, and three quarters of an ounce 
^powdered gmger. Woric it all weU together, let it re- 
main lor twenty-four hours, and then make it into cakes. 

Parliament Cakes. 

Put lata a-sauce-pan two pounds of treade, and when 
it boih^ add a quarter of a pound of butter, and pour it 
upon two pounds of flour ; add a little ahun, and a bit of 
pearl ash about the size of a nut, and an oimce of ginger. 
Work it well with the hand till quite smooth; let it stand

a day and a night, then roll it out yery thin, and cut it 
into oblong cakes. 

Oatmeal Cakes; 

One should only be made at a time, as the mixture 
dries quickly. Put two or three huidfuls of meal into a 
bowl, and moisten it wiUi water merely sufficient to form 
it into a cake ; knead it out round and round with the 
hands upon the pasteboard, strewing meal under and 
over it ; it may be made as thin as a wafer, or thicker, 
according to taste, and put it on a hot iron plate, called a 
girdle. Bake it till it be a little brown on the under side, 
then take it off, and toast that side before the fire, which 
was uppermost on the girdle. The toaster is such as is 
commonly used for heating smoothing irons, having a back 
to support the cake. To make these cakes solt, they 
must not be toasted before the fire, but both sides done 
quickly on the girdle. 

Girdle Cakes. 

Rub three ounces of fresh butter into one pound of 
flour, with half a tea-spoonful of salt ; moisten with a suf- 
ficiency of sweet buttermilk to make it into a paste ; roll 
it out, and cut it into cakes with a cup or tumbler, and 
bake them upon a girdle. 

Bath Buns. 

To four pounds of dried and sifted flour allow one pound 
of fresh butter, three quarters of a pound of caraway com- 
fits, the well-beaten yolks of four, and the whites of two 
egf^y six table-spoonfuls of cream, and the same quantity 
of fresh yeast. Melt the butter, mix it with the flour, 
and add the eggs, cream, and yeasty previously beaten 
together ; cover it, and let it rise for twenty or thirty mi- 
nutes, then shake in the caraway comfits, keeping a few 
to strew over the tops ; form the buns, and bake them 
upon buttered tins. 



CAKES, BISCUITS, &C. 369 

Biscuit. 

Make as stiff a paste as possible of the finest floury 
ynijong it with cold water, and adding a little salt ; beat 
it out with a rolling pin, cut it into pieces^ lay them one 
over the other, and again beat it oat ; roll it very thin, 
cat It into biscoits, and prick them well with a fork. To 
make the Prince of Wales' biscait, roll llhe paste into 
small balls, and press it with a stamp. 

Another way to make Biscuit. 

Rub seven ounces •f fresh butter into two pounds of 
flour, mix with it two large spoonfuls of yeast, cover it 
with a cloth, and let it stand an hour ; then add as much 
wanned new milk as will make it into a paste as stiff as 
pie-criMt ; form it into biscuits of about an ounce and a 
half each ; bake them in a quick oven. The following 
day, after bread has been baked, put them again into the 
oven, and let them remain for nearly three hours. 

Sweet Biscuit. 

One pound of flour, half a pound of butter, the same 
quantity of finely-pounded sugar, and two eggs, without 
being beaten ; make it all into a very stiff paste with cold 
water, roll it out, and to form the biscuits, roll a bit of 
the paste into a ball about the size of the yolk of an egg^ 
flatten it a little, and place them upon tins to bake. 

Another way to make Sweet Biscuit. 

To one pound of flour allow half a pound of sugar, two 
beaten eggs^ a tea-spoonful of caraway seeds, and a quar- 
ter of a pound of melted butter ; mix all well together^ 
roll it out thin, and cut it into round biscuits ; prick them, 
and bake them upon tins. 

Oliver's Biscuit.

it into a stiff paste ; work it well together, and let it re^ 
main for two or three hours, and then roll it out, and 
make it into small square biscuits, and into round balls a 
little flattened ; prick them with a fork, and bake them 
upon tins in a quick oven. Take care they do not be- 
come brown. 

Cold Harbour Balls, 

Dissolve one ounce of butter in as much milk warm-

about two pints may be required ; add half a tea-spoon- 
ful of salt, one egg beaten together with a table-spoon fid 
eif yeast ; mix it all well, cover it with a cloth, and let 
it remain before the fire for half an hour ; then make it 
into small round baUs, and bake them upon tins in a quick 
oven.

Muffins. 

Make two quarts of milk rather warmer than when it 
comes from the cow ; then, with a horn or wooden spoon, 
mix with it about a tea-cupful of good fresh yeast ; stir 
flour into it till it be as thick as a batter ; cover it, and let 
^t remain to rise for an hour, then take it out by spoonfuls, 
and drop it amongst flour, and let it remain fifteen mi- 
nutes ; take them up, flatten them a little, and bake them 
upon a metal plate ; when one side is a little brown, turn 
them. When to be eaten, toast them, and with a knife 
cut them a little all roimd, then pull them open and but- 
ter them. 

Sally Liins, or Bath Breakfast Cakes. 

"RfiB into two pounds of flour half a pound of butter, 
and mix with it one pint of milk a little warmed, aquar«> 
ter of a pint of fresh yeast, four weU-beaten eggs, and a 
tea-spoonful of salt ; coyer it, and let it stand before ihe 
Are to rise for three quarters of an hour ; make it into 
thick cakes about the size of the inside of a dinner plate ; 
bake them in a quick oyen, then cut ^em into three, that 
the middle slice, as also the top and bottom, may be well 
buttered. Serye them hot. 

To make Bread. 

To thirteen pounds of sifted flour allow four quarts of 
lukewarm milk or water, — -in winter it must be warmer, 
but not scalding hot eyen in the coldest weather ; put the 
milk into a wooden trough or large earthen pan ; add & 



372 CAKES, BISCUITS, &C. 

large table-spoonftil of coane salt ; stir in a few handfuls 
of flour, and three qnartera of a pint of beer yeast, or 
more if not very thick ; then stir in flour till it be like a 
thick batter; throw some flour on the top, and set it be- 
fore the fire. If the yeast be good, the mixture will rise 
in ten minutes to the top of the pan ; then stir in some 
more flour, and replace it before the fire. When it has 
risen a second time, take out as much dough as will 
make the rolls, knead it about five minutes, form the rolls, 
prick them with a fork, and put them on a tin ; place them 
before the fire to rise for ten minutes, and bake them in 
a pretty quick oven. The dough for the loaves must be 
kneaded for twenty minutes or half an hour. Form the 
loaves, and put them into tin pans, which may be rather 
more than half filled ; prick them, and place them before 
the fire ; when they have risen nearly to the top of the 
pans, they may be put into the oven and baked one hour. 
If a metal oven is used, it must be made moderately hot, 
that the bread may be well raised without being scorched. 
The addition of an ounce of potato, to a pound of 
wheaten flour, will be found a great improvement to 
bread. When it is to be used, moisten it with a little 
cold water or milk, then pour into it a portion of the wa- 
ter, or milk, to be used for the baking, made nearly boil- 
ing hot ; add the remainder of the liquid required, which 
should be milk-warm : and, when the whole is a proper 
heat, mix with it the yeast and flour ; and proceed as be-. 
fore directed. 

Another way to make Bread. 

Mix into six pounds of sifted flour one ounce of salt, 
nearly half a pint of fresh sweet yeast as it comes from 
the brewery, and a suflicient quantity of warmed milk to 
make the whole into a stifi* dough ; work and knead it well 
upon a paste-board, on which a little flour has been strew- 
ed, for fifteen or twenty minutes, then put it into a deep 
pan, cover it with a warmed towel, set it before the fire, 
and let it rise for an hour and a half, or perhaps two hours ; 
cut off a piece of this spunge or dough ; knead it well for 



CAK£S, BISCUITS, &C. 373 

eight or ten minntes, together with flour merely sufficieDt 
to keep it from adhering to the board ; put it into small 
tins, filling them three parts full ; dent the rolls all round 
with a knife, and let them stand a few minutes before put- 
ting them into the oven. The remainder of the dough 
must then be worked up for loaves, and baked either in 
or oat of a shape. 

Brown Bread. 

Either of the above receipts may be followed, allow- 
ing a little more yeast, less liquid, and kneading the dough 
for a longer time. It may be made o( oatmeal, or of a 
mixture of wheat, barley, and rye flour, the proportion 
of wheat flour being doubled ; but the finest brown bread 
is made of wheat ground over head. 

Stale Bread 

May be made nearly as good as when newly baked, 
by putting it into a cool oven for nearly an hour. 

French Bread. 

With one pound of flour rub two ounces of fresh but- 
ter. Mix, with three or four table-spoonfuls of lukewarm 
milk, one of fresh beer yeast, and a beaten egg; work this 
with the flour, and set it to rise before the fire for about 
an hour, then knead it like bread ; make it into two cakes, 
and place them upon buttered tins ; let them stand before 
the fire an hour and a half, and bake them in a quick oven 
for fifteen minutes. 

A little sugar and a few caraway seeds may be added 
for a change. These cakes may be eaten hot. 

Rolls. 

Dissolve two ounces of butter in one pint of new 
milk, and 9tir it into four pounds of flour, as also three 
table-spoonfuls of yeast, a tea-spoonful of salt, and the 
well-beaten whites of two eggs ; cover the pan with a 
warmed towel, and set it before the fire to rise for half an 
hour, then work it one way for fifteen minutes ; form it 



374- CAKES) BISCtJIT^ &C. 

mto rolls, place them upon tins, and let them rise for ten 
minutes hefore putting them into an oren. 

French Rolls. 

Mix rather more than an ounce of coarse salt with 
eight pounds of sifted flour ; make a hole in the middle, 
and pour in ahout half a pint of good yeast, the well 
heaten whites of four egp, and as much new milk warm- 
ed as will mix it to a middling stiffness ; clap and work 
it down one way with the hands fbr half an hour, hut do 
not knead it ; cover it with a warmed towel, and let it 
rise hefore the fire for half an hour ; take off the surface, 
which soon becomes hard, and put it aside to be made 
into a roll ; work and clap the dough, form it into rolls, 
place them upon tins, and let them rise for ten minutes ; 
bake them in a quick oven. 

Yeast. 

Beer yeast, which is the best for bread, should be 
strained through a hair sieve, and two or three quarts of 
cold spring water poured over it ; when it has stood for 
twenty-four hours, the water should be poured off, the 
yeast will then be found at the bottom of the vessel, quite 
thick. To preserve that which may be left over the 
baking, it should be put into a bottle, corked tightly, and 
kept in a cool place. In cold weather it will continue 
good for a fortnight, but fresh yeast is always preferable. 
When it does not appear sufficiently strong, honey or 
brown sugar may be mixed with it, in the proportion of 
a tea-spoonful to half a pint 

Brau Yeast. 

Boil for ten minutes, in two quarts of water, one pint 
of bran, and a small handful of good hops ; strain it through 
a sieve, and, when milk-warm, add three or four table- 
spoonfuls of beer yeast, and two of brown sugar or treacle ; 
put it into a wooden stoup or jug ; cover it, and place it 
before the fire to ferment. It may be bottled, tightly 
corked, and kept in a cool place. 



CAKES) BISCUITS, &C. 375 

Potato Yeast. 

Boil some good mealy potatoes ; peel and weigh them ; 
while hot, hmise them finely, and mix them quickly with 
boiling water, allowing one quart to each pound ; rub it 
through a hair sieve, then add honey or brown sugar, in 
the proportion of one ounce to each ^uart of water ; boil 
it to the consistency of batter^ and when nearly cold, add 
a large table-spoonful of good 3reast to every quart of wa- 
ter ; cover it with a cloth to rise, and the following day 
it will be ready far use ; keep a bottle of it, which may 
be used instead of beer yeast for the next making, first 
pouring off the thin liquid that is on the top. It must be 
made with fresh beer yeast every two or three months. 
Doable the quantity of this, as of beer yeast, is required 
to make bread light. 

A Baker's Yeast. 

Boil two ounces of hops in four quarts of water one 
boiuv adding more water as it decreases, carefully stir- 
jiDg it all toe time, and taking care that it do not boil 
over ; «traiQ the liquor, and mix well with it two pounds 
of malt ; cover, and let it stand for eight hours, or until 
it be milk-warm, then stir in half a pint of good yeast ; 
when mixed well together, let it work for ten hours, and 
tiwn strain it through a hair sieve. 



3T6 PRESERVES. 



CHAPTER XVI 
PRESERVES. 

FR£PARATORT REMARKS ON SWEETMEATS. 

All sweetmeats should be preserved in a brass pan, 
which must be well scoured with sand and vinegar, wasli- 
ed with hot water, and wiped perfectly dry before it is 
used. 

An iron plate or a stove is preferable to a fire for pre- 
serving on ; and by boiling the fruit quickly, the form, co- 
lour, and flavour, will be better preserved, and there will 
be less waste, than in slow boiling. A round wooden 
sticky smaller at the one end than the other, in Scotland 
called a thevil, is better adapted for stirring sugar or pre- 
serves with than a silver spoon, which last is only used 
for skimming. That there may be no waste in taking off 
the scum, it is put through a fine silk sieve, or through a 
hair sieve, with a bit of muslin laid into it ; the clear part 
will run into the vessel placed below, and may be return- 
ed to the preserving pan. 

A silver soup ladle is used for putting preserves into 
the jars, which should be of brown stone, or of white 
wedgewood ware. After the jellies or preserves are put 
in, they must not be moved till quite cold, when they an' 
covered with a piece of white paper, cut so as to fit into 
the jar, and dipped into brandy or rum. They are then 



PREPARATORY REMARKS. 377 

Stored in a cool dry place, and should be looked at occa- 
sionally. If in a few weeks they be observed to ferment, 
the sirup should be first strained from the fruit, then boil- 
ed till it is thick, and again poured over the fruity pre- 
Tiously put into clean jars. 

Sugar, low in price, and consequently coarse in quality^ 
is far from being cheapest in the end ; while that which is 
most refined is always the best. White sugars should be 
chosen as shining and as close in texture as possible. 

The best sort of brown sugar has a bright and gravelly 
appearance. 

A jelly-bag is made of half a square of flannel folded 
by the comers, and one side sewed up ; the top bound 
with tape, and four loops also of tape sewed on, so as to 
hang upon a stand made of four bars of wood, each thirty- 
six inches in height, fastened with four bars at the top^ 
each measuring ten inches, with hooks upon the comers. 
Twelve inches from the bottom four more bars are placed. 
A pan or basin is put imdemeath to receive the juice or 
jelly as it drops through the bag. 



To Clarify Sugar. 

To every three pounds of loaf sugar, allow the beaten 
white of one egg, and a pint and a half of water ; break 
the sugar small, put it into a nicely-cleaned brass pan, and 
pour the water over it ; let it stand some time before it be 
put upon the fire ; then add the beaten whites of the eggs ; 
stir it till the sugar be entirely dissolved, and when it boils 
up, pour in a quarter of a pint of cold water ; let it boil 
up a second time ; take it off the fire, and let it settle for 
fifteen minutes ; carefully take ofljil the scum ; put it on 



SI7S PRESSBYES. 

the fire^ and boil it till snfficiently thick,' or, if required, 
till candy high, in order to ascertain which, drop a little 
from a spoon into a small jar of cold water, and if it be- 
come quite hard^ it is then snfficiently done ; or dip the 
thevil into the smgar, plunge it into cold water, draw off 
the sugar which adheres to the stick, and if it be hard and 
Koaps, the fruit to be preserved must be instantly put in 
and boiled. 

To Boil Sugar. 

To every pound of sugar allow half a pint of water ; 
slir it over the fire till the sugar be entirely dissolved ; 
when it first boils up, pour in a little cold water, and when 
it boils a second time, take it off the fire ; let it settle ten 
minutes, carefully scum it, and boil it for half an hour or 
a little longer, and then put in the fruit. 

Orange Marmalade. 

Allow equal weight of bitter oranges and fine loaf 
sugar ; wash the oranges, wipe them dry, and grate off any 
discolom-ed part ; cut the rind in half, and with a dessert- 
spoon loosen it all round to take off each of the halves 
entire ; take the core and seeds dean from the oranges, 
leaving the juice with the pulp ; put the skin into a sauce* 
pan with plenty of cold water, and cover it closely with a 
cloth underneath the cover ; let them boil for some hours, 
till so tender that the head of a pin will easily pierce them ; 
drain off the water, and while they are hot, with a silver 
spoon scoop out all the soft part, leaving the skins quite 
thin ; cut them into thin parings half an inch long ; cla- 
rify and boil the sugar candy high ; put ia the parings, 
and in ten minutes add the juice and pulp, and boil all 
together till transparent Part of the peel may be grated 
to heigbten the colour, and a pound and a haif of sugar 
to tbe pound of (ranges may be used. 

Another way to make Orange Marmalade. 

To three pounds of fruit allow five of sugar ; pare the 
Dtraoges ; cut. the pedMoto thin chips, and put them into 



FRE8XRTX8. 379 

cold water ; clear the pulp from the seeds and inside skin, 
and strew over it potmded loaf sugar ; next day drain the 
chips, put liiem into a linen hag, and boil them for three 
hoan in plenty of cold water ; they are again drained and 
boiled, togedier with the pulp, for ten minutes, or till it 
jelly in the sugar, which has been clarified and boiled 
candy high. In making minced marmalade, the skins must 
be boiled, and then finely minced with a knife. The juice 
of a pound of lemons is sometimes added, but in other 
respects the process is the same. 

Another way to make Orange Marmalade. 

Wash the oranges^ and grate off any defective part ; 
to three pounds of fruit allow five of fine loaf sugar ; put 
the oranges into a sauce-pan with plenty of cold water ; 
cover it closely, and let them boil till a straw or the head 
of a pin will easily pierce them ; take them out, cut them 
into four, pick out the seeds, and slice them, skin and all, 
as thin as possible ; break the sugar small, and to each 
pound aUow a quarter of a pint of water ; stir it till the 
sugar be dissolved, and when it has boiled a few minutes, 
take it off the fire ; pour in a quarter of a pint of cold 
water, which will throw up all the refuse ; scum it off; 
put it again on the fire, and if any more scum rises, 
remove it ; add the sliced oranges, and boil for fifteen 
minutes. 

Lemon Marmalade. 

Allow to a pound of lemons eighteen ounces of fine 
loaf sugar ; grate the rind of a few ; cut them into half ; 
squeeze and strain the juice ; boil the vkins in the same 
way as those of the orange are done ; scoop out the pulp 
and white part ; cut half into thin chips ih* parings, and 
pound the other half in a mortar ; pound tiie sugar, and 
pour over it the juice ; stir, and let it boil for five minutes ; 
take it off the fire ; ddm it ; put in the parings and the 
pounded skins ; boil it for five minutes, then add the gra* 
ted peel, and let it boil for five minutes more ; take it off^ 
and stir it till half cold, before putting it into jars. 



380 PEE6ERYES. 

Orange Jelly for Breakfast. 

Wash the oranges, grate off the outer rind, cnt them 
in half, and after squeezing out the juice, put them into a 
pan with water in the proportion of one quart to every 
pound of oranges ; hoil them gently for an hour, or till 
the water is reduced to rather less than half ; strain it and 
the juice through a sieve ; to every pint of the liquor add 
one pound of loaf sugar ; boil them together till they jelly, 
which may be in twenty minutes, skimming it well. 

Red Currant Jelly. 

Gather the currants upon a dry day, pick them clean, 
pound them in a mortar, and drip tliem through a tammy, 
or flannel bag ; to every pint of juice allow a pound of fine 
loaf sugar ; it may be broken small, and boiled with the 
juice ; but to make the jelly beautiiblly clear, clarify and 
boil the sugar candy high ; add the juice, and boil it six 
minutes. 

A pint of white currants to every quart of red improves 
the colour. 

Another way to make Red Currant Jelly. 

Clarify and boil, till candy high, fourteen pounds of 
sugar ; add three pounds of nicely-picked raspberries, boil 
them quickly for three minutes, and then put in twelve 
pounds of clean-picked currants, and boil them for three 
or four minutes, and strain it through a fine sieve. 

The currants may be made into a rolled pudding. 

Another way to make Red Currant Jelly. 

Gather the currants with the stalks, put them into 
a tub of cold water ; take them out gently, put them into 
a sieve, and then lay them out for half an hour upon a 
table-cloth. Put them into a preserving pan, adding one 
pint of raspberries to four of currants ; and as much water 
as to prevent their burning ; allow them to become quite 
hot, but not to boil ; shake the pan to prevent the fruit 



PRESERVES. 3^1 

adberhig to the l>ottom or sides ; strain it throngh a jelly- 
bag. To every pint of juice allow one pound of pounded 
loaf sngar^ and when it comes to a boil, boil it one mi- 
nute. ' Only remove tbe scum when the pan is taken off 
the fire. 

Wash and prepare black currants as the red are direct- 
ed to be done ; put them into a preserving pan^ adding a 
pint of water to a quart of fruit ; let it be so hot as mere- 
ly to admit of its being squeezed through a thin linen cloth 
with the hand. To a pint of juice allow a pound of loaf 
sugar, and when it boils, boil it three minutes. Skim it 
when taken off the fire. 

Magnum Bonum Plums. 

Gather the plums with stalks^ scald them in boiling 
water, and take off the skins, leavmg on the stalks. If 
not quite ripe, they will require to be simmered a few 
minutes over a stove ;-■ to every pound of fruit, allow one 
of fine loaf sugar ; clarify it, and when nearly boiled candy 
high, put in the plums, and boil them fifteen minutes ; 
with a spoon carefully pot them into a basin, and^ let 
them stand a day or two ; then boil them ten minutes, or 
till perfectly transparent ; put them into the jars ; strain 
the sirup through a sieve, and pour it equally over them. 

White Currant Jelly. 

Gather the fruit upon a dry day; and pick it from 
the stalks ; pound it in a mortar, and drip the juice through 
a flannel bag. To every pint allow a pound of fine loaf 
sugar ; break it small, and with the juice, put it into a 
preserving pan ; stir it till it boils ; skim^ and let it boil 
exactly six minutes ; or the juice may be boiled the same 
length of time in sugar previously clarified and boiled 
candy high. 

To Preserve Yellow White Gooseberries, 
called The Sulphur. 

Gather them upon a dry day, and before they are 
very ripe ; take equal weight of finely-pounded sugar and 



882 PRK&SBV£6. 

gooseberries ; top and tail, and prick tbem with a large 
needle ; as they are donet strew over them a little sugar. 
To each pound of gooseberries, allow half a pint of white 
currant jnice^ and half a pound of pounded sugar. Put 
the sugar, gooseberries, and juice alternately into the pre* 
serving pan, set it over the fire, and shake it every now 
and then, till the sugar be dissolved, and then carefully 
remove ^e fruit from the sides of the pan. When it 
boils, skim it, and let it boil exactly twenty-four minutes. 
The large rough red gooseberries are preserved predse- 
ly in the same way, and when they come to a boil^ must 
be allowed to boil for twenty minutes. 

Another way to Preserve Gooseberries. 

The tops and tails being removed from the gooseberries, 
allow an equal quantity of finely-poimded loaf sugar, and 
put a layer of each alternately into a large deep jar ; pour 
into it as much dripped currant juice, either red or white, 
as will dissolve the sugar, addmg its weight in sugar ; the 
foUoiving day» put all into 9 preserviiig pin, and boil it. 

To Prei^erve Yellow or Green Gooseberries. 

The tops and tails being removed from the gooseberries, 
slit them up the sides, and with a silver knife, or the top 
of a tea-spoon, take out the seeds, and put them^ with the 
pulp which adheres to ihem, into a sieve ; the juice which 
drams from them boil with the sugar, previously weighed 
in equal quantities with the fruit ; then add the goose- 
berry skins, and boil them till perfectly clear. 

Gooseberry Jam for Puddings. 

Allow equal weight of the red rough gooseberries, and 
of good brown sugar ; gather the fruit upon a dry day ; 
top and tail tbem, and put a layer alternately of goose- 
berries and of sugar into a preserving pan ; shake it fre- 
quently, sldm it well, and boil it till the sirup jeUies^ which 
may be ascertained by cooling a little in a saucer.

be put into a small jar, covered with spirits of wine, and 
allowed to stand till the jars are tied up, when a few may 
be pat upon the top of each. 

If the stones cannot be easily extracted, the apricots 
may be divided into halves ; or they may be preserved 
without being stoned. The Moor Park apricot, the best 
for eating, and excellent for jam, cannot be preserved so 
whole as the common apricot. 

Apricot Jain. 

Weigh equal quantities of pounded loaf sugar and of 
apricots ; pare and cut them quite small ; as they are done^

they are cold, put them into a sirup made with the same 
proportion of sugar as of quinces. The following day, 
hoil them two or three times till clear, and the last time 
for twelve minutes. Cut some small quinces into quar- 
ters, put tliem into a sauce-pan^ with as much water as 
will cover them, boil it fast, till strongly flavoured of the 
quinces ; strain it through a flannel bag, and boil a pint 
of the liquor with a pound of sugar till it be a rich sirup,

days ; take them out^ wash them, and put them into a 
pan, with leaves under and over, and a little salt in the 
water ; let them simmer, but not boil ; when cold, if not 
sufficiently greened, again put them into fresh water, with 
fresh leaves. Take them out when cold, divide them 
into four, scoop out the seeds and soft part, lay them in- 
to cold water, which changpa fireqnently through the day, 
till it be quite clear and tasteless. Clarify the same 
weight of sugar as of cucumbers ; soak in boiling water 
some white ginger, scrape it, and put one ounce to a 
pound of sugar, and the thinly-pared rind of a lemon. 
Boil them with the sirup, and when cold, put in the cu* 
cumbers, and boil them slowl^ for half an hour ; put

fiil of salt ; let them stand by the fireside, or in a warm 
place, for three or four days. Boil the sugar with as 
much water as will dissolve it, and as long as any scum 
rises ; then put in the cucumbers, and simmer them for 
a little time. Repeat this till they are clear and green, 
and, the last time of boiling, add some white ginger 
(Boaked in hot water and scraped, a few grains of allspice, 
and llie peel of a lemon cut very thin. Put the cucum-

half a pound of salt. After standing two days and nights, 
change them into fresh ^old water, and change it fre- 
quently through the day ; then boil them witli plenty of 
cold water in a closely-covered sauce-pan, till the head 
of a pin will easily pierce them ; clarify the sugar, allow- 
ing a pound to each orange ; place the skins in a potting 
can or flat vessel, and pour the sirup into and over them.

Damsons, cherries, and gooseberries, may be done in 
this way ; any sort will keep for a year. Cut off the stalks 
of the cherries, and top and tail the gooseberries. 

To keep Green Gooseberries. 

Gather the gooseberries when quite formed, but not 
the least soft ; top and tail them ; fill them into wide-* 
mouthed bottles up to the neck, and cork them slightly ; 
place them in a copper, with sawdust or straw in the bot« 
torn, and pour in cold water to reach to the necks of the 
bottles ; light the fire, and when the water boils up, in*' 
stantly take out the bottles, and fill them up from a tea* 
kettle with boiling water ; cork them again slightly, and 
when cold, put them in tightly ; lay the bottles upon their 
sides in a dry cool place, and turn them every other day 
for a month. When to be used, the liquor and fruit are put 
into a dish, and sweetened with brown sugar. 

To save Sugar in Preserving Cherries, Green 
GageSy Damsons, Currants, and Raspberries. 

Gather tlie fruit perfectly dry, and to a pound allow 
five ounces of finely-pounded loaf sugar ; put a layer of 
fruit into a wide-mouthed bottle or jar, and then one o£ 
sugar, till tbe vessel is fall ; tie tightly over it two folds 
of sound bladder, and put them into a copper or pan, with 
UtiMr in the bottom, and water as high as the necks, and 
lel ihsD^ simmer for three hours. When the water cools, 
llk» om the bottles, and keep them in a cool dry place. 



3M PRESERYSSi 

Damsons for Winter use. 

Gather the damsons wlieii just ripe, and perfeetljr 
sound ; fill a two-gallon brandy keg, and pour over tw9 
pounds of treade ; close the k^ firmly, and tarn it erery 
day. 

To Preserve Damsons. 

To every poond of damsons allow three quarters of a 

Sound of pounded loaf sugar ; put into jars altemately a 
lyer of damsons, and one of sugar ; tie them orer with 
kkdder or strong paper, and put them into an oven after 
the bread is withdrawn, and let them remain till the oven 
is cold. The following day strain off the simp, and boil 
it till thick. When cold, put the damsons one by one into 
SBiall jars, and pour orer them the sirup, which must cover 
^m. Tie them over with wet bladder. 

Another way to Preserve Damsons. 

Prick them with a needle, and boil th^ai willi sugar 
in the same proportion as in the receipt to preserve dam- 
sens, till the sirup will jelly. Carefully tttke off all the 
scum. 

To Preserve the Purple Plum. 

Put into a stone jar a layer of fruit, and one of brown 
sugar, allowing one pound to a pound of the fruit ; cover 
the jar with Imen or bladder, and bake it in an oven for 
one or two hours. In a few weeks pour off the sirup, and 
boil it a short time ; skim it, and when cold^ pour it over 
Ae fruit. 

It may be eaten with oream, or made into tarts or pud- 
dings. 

Gooseberry and Raspberry Cakes. 

Gather the gooseberries upon a dry day, and before 
they are ifmte ripe ; top and tail them ; scald them, or put 
them into an eai^en jar ; tie it closely over with bladder, 
Bnd place it in a pan of water ; let it boil till the fruit is 



PRESERVES. 399 

sufficiently taider to pnip through a sieve. To a pound of 
the pulp add one pound of pounded and sifted loaf sugar, 
and the well-heaten white of one egg ; mix all together, 
and whisk it for three hours ; drop the cakes upon wri- 
ting paper, and dry them in the sun, or upon a stove. Th^ 
pulp of damsons may he done in the same way. 

For the raspberry cakes, allow a pound of sugar to a 
pint of the fruit, measured before it is scalded, or pulped 
through a sie^e ; allow one white of an egg to each pound, 
and for each sort of cakes dry the sugar well, and use it 
while it is warm. Keep them in a tin box, with folds of 
white paper between each layer. The whites of two eggs 
being added to each pound of sugar, half the beating will 
be found sufficient. 

Quince Cakes. 

Boil the quinces till quite soft, rub them through a 
sieve, and to a pint of juice add three quarters of a pound 
of pounded loaf sugar ; mix all well together, and make 
it scalding hot, but do not allow it to boil ; drop it upon 
tins in the form of small cakes^ and dry them in a cool 
oven, and before the fire. 

Seville Orange Cakes. 

Divide the oranges in half, take out the seeds, and 
put the pulp and juice into a basin ; boil the rinds in a 
sauce-pan of water, closely covered ; when very tender 
take them out, and dry them upon a cloth ; allow to a 
pound of orange rinds, two of pounded loaf sugar ; pound 
the rinds in a mortar; add by degrees the sugar, and then 
the juice and pulp ; mix it thoroughly till thick and yel* 
low ; drop it upon tins in small cakes, and dry them un- 
der garden glasses, or in a cool o«fl;).v««^« 

If it be too thick to drop, let it stand a night. 

To Dry Cherries. 

Gather the cherries perfectly dry, and to every siac 
pounds allow one and a half of finely-pounded loaf sugar ; 
strew it over the cherries in a deep dish, and let them re- 



400 PAESERVES. 

main twelve hours ; put tliem into a preserring-pan ; make 
them scalding hot ; put them into a bowl ; the next day 
again heat them ; take them ou^ of the sirup^ and lay them, 
upon sieves under garden glasses, to dry in the sun ; turn 
them daily upon clean sieves, till quite dry ; spread them 
upon sheets of white paper, and keep them in a box. 

The sirup may be boiled till thick, and kept as a jelly, 
or with currants made into a tart. 

To Dry Barberries in Bunches. 

Gather the barberries when ripe ; tie the finest into 
bunches ; bruise some of the inferior ones, and boil them 
in water ; strain, and boil in a pint of it one pound and a 
half of loaf sugar to every three pounds of barberries ;. 
skim and boil the sugar fifteen minutes ; put in the bunches 
of fiodt, and simmer them for six minutes ; let them stand 
in a china bowl till the following day, and boil them 
gently till clear. When cold, take them out of the sirup, 
and dry them under garden glasses ; turn them daily. 

To Candy Currants, Barberries, and* 

other Fruit. 

Boil the fruit in clarified sugar as for preserving ; take 
it out of the sirup and drain it upon sieves; sift over it, 
through a lawn sieve, till quite white, pounded loaf sugar. 
Place them in a c^ol oven, and turn and dust them with 
sugar till dry. 

Raspberry Vinegar. 

Bruise a quart of fresh-gathered raspbemes in a china 
basin ; pour over it a pint of good vinegar, cover it close- 
ly; let it stand three days, and stir it daily; strain it 
through a flannel bag; let it drip as long as any thing will 
come from it, but do not press it ; to a pint of tlie liquor 
put one pound of pounded loaf sugar, boil it ten minutes, 
and take off the scum as it rises. When cold, bottle and 
coi'k it tightly. 

A glass of brandy may be added to a quart of rasp* 
beiry vinegar* 



PRESERVES. 401 

Another way to make Raspberry Vinegar. 

Fill a dry clean bottle with raspberries, and pnt as 
much Tinegar as the bottle will contain ; stop it closely, 
and let it stand for a month ; then strain it, and to a pint 
of the liqnor pat a pound of loaf sugar ; boil it for half an 
hour ; skim it. When cold^ bottle and cork it tightly. 

Sirup of Currants, Raspberries, or 

Mulberries. 

Pick the fruit from the stalks ; squeeze the juice, and 
let it stand ten days or a fortnight, or till the ferments* 
tion ceases, which may be known by the scum cracking; 
carefully take off the scum, and pour the juice gently 
into a fresh vessel ; let it stand twenty-four hours, and 
again pour it off ; to one pound of pounded loaf sugar al- 
low thirteen ounces of the juice, put it into a preserving- 
pan, and when it begins to boil, strain it through a jelly- 
bag, and bottle it when cold. 

Burie pears boiled in a little of the sirup are beauti- 
ful. 

Black Currant Lozenges. 

Put six quarts of clean-picked black currants into a 
preserving-pan ; with the hand bruise them as long as the 
heat will admit ; squeeze them through a sieve^ and to 
every pint of juice put four ounces of good brown sugar; 
boil and stir it for three quarters of an hour, and then pour 
it thinly over sauces or small plates, and dry it for Urree 
successive days before the fire ; cut it into small dice, or 
with a turnip-scoop ; lay them upon white paper in a box. 
Or the cakes may be cut into lozenges as they are re- 
quired. 

A little dissolved isinglass may be added while the 
juice is boiling. 

Elder Rob. 

Gather the elderberries when quite ripe, put them 

2c 



402 jPBSSERYXft. 

into a stone jar, tie a bladder or paper over the top^ and 
place the jar in a pan of water ; let it boil till the berries 
are rerf soft ; strain them through a coarse cloth, and to 
erery pint of juice allow half a pound of good brown su- 
gar ; put it into a preserving-pan, stir it, and when it boils, 
take off the scum, and let it boil fox one hour. 

Cinnamon Tablet. 

To a pound of loaf sugar, clarified and boiled till it can 
be blown through the holes of a skimmer, allow half an 
^ounce of pounded and sifted cinnamon, or a teapspoonful 
of the oil of cinnamon ; stir it well with the sugar, and 
press it with a spoon to the sides of the pan, to make it 
perfectly smooth ; rub some plates over with fresh butter^ 
and pour in the tablet. When cold, cut it into square bits. 
Ciinger tablet may be made in this way, allowing a quar- 
ter of an ounce of ginger to a pound of sugar. 

Lemon Drops. 

Squeeze and strain the juice of six goodndzed lemons ; 
mix with it pounded and sifted loaf sugar, till so thick that 
it is stirred with difficulty ; put it into a preserving-pan, 
and, with a wooden spoon, stir it constantly, and let it 
b(Hl five or six minutes ; then drop it from the point of a 
knife, upon writing paper, in drops as large as a shilling. 
When cold, they will readily come off. 

Barley Sugar Drops, 

Clarifi; and boil the sugar to that degree, that upon 
dipping in a wooden stick, and plunging it into cold wa- 
tar, the sugar becomes crisp, and will snap ; boil with it 
the thinly-pared rind of one or two lemons ; drop the su- 
gar upon a stone or marble slab in round drops ; when 
quite cold, roll them in sifted loaf sugar, and lay them be- 
tween layers of white paper, or fold them in little bits <^ 
square paper, and twist it at the end. 

Barley Sugar.

mon juice, or oil of lemons ; rub a little fresh batter over 
a stone or marble slab^ and poor the sugar along it in nar- 
row strips ; twist it while warm, and when cold, with a 
knife mark it across, and it will break into any lengths. 



AM VINEGARS* 



CHAPTER XVII. 
VINEGARS. 

A CASK which has not contained vinegar before, should 
have a quart of boiling hot vinegar poured into it, shaken 
till cold, and allowed to stand for some hours. 



Sugar Vinegar. 

To five gallons of water put eight pounds of coarse 
brown sugar ; let it boil as long as any scum rises, which 
roust be carefully removed ; then pour it into a cask, and 
when it is about milk-warm, or from 60 to 65 degrees 
Fahrenheit, cut off the crust, and toast a quarter of a slice 
of bread, and cover it over with fresh yeast ; put it into 
the cask, leave it open for four or five days, and then paste 
over the bung-hole a piece of paper, and pierce it here and 
there with a pin. It should be kept in a warm, dry place, 
without being moved; and if made in March or April, it 
may he drawn off and bottled in September, when it may 
be boiled a quarter of a minute to prevent the mother from 
forming in the bottles, and it will keep good for years, 
though it should not be kept from the contact of the air, 
or in vessels entirely filled. 

The vinegar cask, as soon as emptied, should be again 
filled in the same manner. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. 

Gather yellow gooseberriea when quite ripe, crush 



VINEGARS. 405 

and masb them well in a tnb with a large wooden pestle ; 
to every two gallons of gooseberries, after being mashed^ 
put two of water ; mix them well together ; let it work for 
three weeks, stirring the mass two or three times each 
day ; then strain the liquor through a hair sieve, and put 
to every gallon one pound of brown sugar, one pound of 
treacle, and a table-spoonful of fresh yeast ; let it work 
for three or four days in the same tub, which has been 
well washed ; then rub it into iron-hooped casks. Let it 
stand twelve months, and bottle it for use. This is a very 
strong vinegar. 

Another way to make Gooseberry Vinegar. 

Bruise to a mash any kind of gooseberries, when quite 
ripe, and mix thoroughly with a gallon of the mash three 
of cold boiled water ; let it stand twenty-four hours, strain 
it through a cloth, and to each gallon of the liquor, put 
one pound of brown sugar ; mix it well, and when quite 
dissolved, put it into a cask. It must stand nine or ten 
months before being bottled. 

Currants, or any other fruit of which wine is made, may 
be substituted for gooseberries. 

American Vinegar. 

Boil six gallons of water, and add, while it is hot, four 
quarts of molasses ; put it into a tub to cool ; when milk- 
warm, stir in a pint of fresh yeast ; put it into the cask, 
and set it by the fire for twenty-four hours ; then put it 
in the sun, with a bottle in the bung-hole* Bottle it three 
months afterwards. 

Cucumber Vinegar. 

Pare ten large cucumbers, cut them into thin slices ; 
pour over them a quart of vinegar ; add a clove of garlic, 
and one or two shalots, a tea-spoonful of ground white 
pepper, and one of salt ; let it stand for ten or twelve days ; 
strain and bottle it ; put a little whole pepper into the 
mouth of each bottle, and cork it tightly. The flavour of 



406 VINEGARS. 

the encumbers may be very well preseryed^ by simply 
steeping tbem in vinegar. 

Garlic Vinegar. 

Cut small one ounce and a half of garlic, bnxise one 
nutmeg and three cloves, steep them in a quart of vine- 
gar for a week, shaking it daily ; then strain and bottle it. 

Shalot vinegar is made in the same manner. 

Harvey's, or Camp Vinegar. 

Put the following ingredients into two quarts of strong 
vinegar, three table-spoonfuls of Indian soy^ and the same 
quantity of mushroom catsup, six anchovies, two heads of 
garlic, a quarter of an ounce of cayenne, and as much 
cochineal as will colour it ; shake it two or three times 
arday for a fortnight, then filter, and bottle it for use. Two 
tea-spoonfuls of this vinegar improves salad sauce, fish 
and sauce also, and is good in most made dishes. 

Elder Flower, and Tarragon Vinegar. 

Fill a quart bottle with the flowers of elder, or the 
leaves of tarragon, when it is in flower ; pour vinegar upon 
them, and let them infuse for a fortnight ; then strain it 
through a flannel bag, and put it into small bottles. 

By the same means, vinegar may be flavoured with the 
fresh-gathered leaves of any sweet herb. 

Vinegar from the refuse of Raisin Wine^^ 

Ok the raisins firom which ten gallons of wine has been 
made, five gallons of nearly boiling water is poured, the 
dregs or lees, and stalks, are added ; it is then covered 
up, and stirred occasionally. When the taste is complete- 
ly extracted from the fruit, it is squeezed, and the vine- 
gar strained and put into a cask, in whidi it should re- 
main nine or ten months. 

Vinegar from Honey. 

Half a pound of honey must be put to a pint of wateis 
and the honey well dissolved. This mixture is then ex- 



VINEGARS. 40T 

posed to the greatest heat of the suo, without closing 
wholly the bung-hole of the cask, which must be merely 
covered with coarse linen, to prevent the admission of in- 
sects. In about six weeks, the liquor becomes acid, and 
changes to a very strong yinsgar, and of excellent quality.

408 . PICKLES. 



PICKLES. 

PREPARATORY REMARKS ON PICKLES. 

Pickles ought to be stored in a dry place, and the- 
Tessels most approved of for keeping them in, are wide- 
moathed glass bottles^ or strong stoneware jars, having 
corks or bungs, which must be fitted in with linen, and 
covered with bladder or leather ; and for taking the pickles 
out and returning them to the jar, a small wooden spoon 
is kept. The strongest vinegar is used for pickling ; that 
of white wine is more particularly recommended, but 
sugar vinegar will generally be found sufficiently strong. 

It is essential to the excellence and beauty of pickles, 
that they be always completely covered with vinegar. 



To Pickle Gherkins. 

Gather, upon a dry day, some small cucumbei*s oi 
gherkins ; lay them into cold salt-and- water for four days, 

^' with a cabbage leaf laid over to keep them down ; drain 

them, and put them into a perfectly clean brass pan, with 

jh. Tine or cabbage leaves in the bottom, and cover them 

P -. with vinegar and water half and half, strewing a little 
pounded alum, and putting more leaves over them ; let 
the water get scalding hot ; take off the pan ; when nearly 
cold, make it again hot, and repeat this as frequently as 
possible through the day. With fresh leaves, and the 
tsame liquor, put them into a basin to stand all night : the 
next morning, with fresh leaves under and over, and the 
same liquor, heat them twice, and then drain them ; and 



PICKLES. 40^ 

if for six or eight dozen, pat them into the pan with half 
a pint of vinegar, and water sufficient to cover them, and 
some salt ; scald them as before^ and put them off and 
on the fire till they are a ^od green ; drain, and pour 
over them boiling water ; let them lie a short time in 
this, and put them into wide-mouthed bottles or stone 
jars ; have ready vinegai* boiled up with bruised nutmeg 
half an ounce, of ginger, black peppercorns, and whole 
allspice, one ounce each to a quart ; pour it upon the 
gherkins while hot ; cover them till cold^ and tie them 
down with bladders. French beans done in this way are 
beautiful, and answer well pickled with the gherkins, and 
kept together. Nasturtium buds or imitation capers may 
be done after this receipt. 

There is no method adopted which produces so fine a 
green in pickles, as the use of a brass pan ; hut where it 
is objected to, they may be done by the following re- 
ceipts. 

Gherkins. 

Make a pickle of salt-and- water strong enough to bear 
an egg, carefully skimming it while boiling ; when cold, 
put in gherkins or French beans, or whatever is to be 
pickled, and let them stand at the side of the fire for three 
days ; pour off the brine, wipe them dry, and put them 
into a stone jar. In another stone jar, boil, upon a hot 
plate, or in a water bath, as much strong vinegar as will 
cover the pickles; pour it over them, and cover them 
with fresh-gathered vine or cabbage leaves ; place a cloth- 
or plate over the jar^ and let it stand by the aide of the 
fire. 

Next day pour o£f the vinegar, boil it as before, and 
pour it over the pickle, and cover them with fresh leaves ; 
and if they are not a 'good green colour, repeat the same 
process a third time. Then put them into wide-mouthed 
glass bottles, or into strong stoneware jars ; boil vinegar, 
together with spices, in the following proportions: Bruised 
nutmeg half an ounce, black peppercorns, whole allspice, 
and ginger^ one ounce each to a quart ; pour it hot over 



410 PICKLES* 

the pickles, coyer them, and when cold, dose the bottles 
or jars with a bnng^ and tie over them bladder or leather. 

Cucumber Mangoes. 

Cut a long narrow piece out of the sides of large Tur- 
key cucumbers, scoop out the seeds, and with a part of 
them mix some mustard seed, shred garlic, and grated 
horse-radish ; staff the space as full as it will admit of^ 
and replace the piece which was cut off; bind them witli 
a tlnread ; put over them hot vinegar three sucoessiye 
days, and boil with it the last time black pepper, flour of 
mustard, and some salt ; put them into jars, and pour ovtf 
them the boiling yinegar, and when cold, cover them 
closely. 

Sliced Cucumbers and Onions. 

Cut full-grown cucumbers into slices about a quarter 
of an inch thick, and slice some onions thin ; then lay 
them into a dish together, and strew salt over them ; 
cover them with another dish, ^d let them remain for 
twenty-four hours. Put them into a cullender to drain, 
then into a large jar, and pour over them boiled vinegar 
three successive days ; the last time of boiling the vine- 
gar, add white pepper and ginger, pour it over them hot, 
and closely cover them when cold. 

Wahiuts. 

Gather them for pickling when the head of a pin 
will pierce them easily ; run a large needle through them 
here and there, or score them on one side with a knife * 
lay them into a brine of salt-and-water for twelve days, 
dMUiging the brine twice in that time ; strain, and put 
them into a jar, and sprinkle a little salt over them. Boil 
four quarts of vinegar for a hundred walnuts, allowing 
to each quart one ounce of whole black pepper, and one of 
^ger, half an ounce each of sliced nutmeg and whole all- 
spice, a table-spoonful of mustard seed, and one of scra- 
ped horse-radish, one head of garlic, or a small onion ; 
pom it boiling hot over the walnuts, and put a plate on 



PICKLES. 411 

the jar ; when cold, tie it closely down. After tbe wal- 
nuts are used, tbe liquor may be boiled, strained^ and 
bottled^ to use as a pickle. 

Another way to Pickle Walnuts. 

Gather the nuts before the inside shell is hard, which 
may be known by trying them with a pin ; lay them into 
salt-and-water nine days, changing the liquor every tbree 
days ; then take them out, and dxy them in the air on a 
sieve or mat ; they should not touch each other, and they 
should be turned, that every side may become black alike ; 
tben put them into a jar. When half the nuts are in, put 
in an onion, with about thirty cloves stuck into it, and add 
the rest of the nuts. To one hundred walnuts allow half 
a pint of mustai*d seed, a quarter of an ounce of mace> 
half an ounce of black peppercorns, and six bay leaves ; 
boil all the spice in some good common vinegar, and pour 
it boiling upon tbe nuts, observing that they are entirely 
covered ; stop the mouth of the jar with a cloth, and when 
cold, cover it with bladder or leather. In about six 
weeks tbey will be fit for use, when they should be exa-* 
mined, and if they have absorbed the vinegar so much as 
to leave any of the nuts dry, more should be added, but 
it need not be boiled. 

Walnut Catsup. 

When green walnuts are fit for picklmgi take a quart 
of the expressed juice, to which add one pint of vinegar ; 
let it stand four days, then mix with it two large table- 
spoonfuls of salt ; boil it till nearly half wasted ; tie in a 
piece of muslin the following ingredients : The peel of a 
bitter curange, a small head of garlic separated, a quarter 
of an omnce each of finely-beaten mace, nutmeg, and 
cloves ; put it into the bottom of a jar, and pour upon it 
the boiling liquor. Cover it closely, let it stand for a 
month, then strain and bottle it. 

Another way to make Walnut Catsup. 

Slice a hundred full-grown walnuts without shelling 



412 PICKLES. 

them, then beat them in a mortar ; put them into a jar, 
with half a pound of shalots sliced, two heads of garlic, 
one pound of salt, and two quarts of vinegar ; let it stand 
a week^ stirring two or three times each day. Strain, and 
put the liquor into a sauce-pan, with a pint of port wine, 
two ounces of anchovies, and two of black pepper, half 
an ounce of cloves, and the same of mace ; let it boil for 
half an hour, skim it well, run it through a jelly-bag, and 
when quite cold, put it into small bottles ; cork them 
closely, and seal them ; keep them in a dry place. It 
will keep for years, and is .used as a fish sauce. It may 
be made without the wine. 

Mushroom Catsup. 

Cut off the stalks from the broad flat mushrooms ; peel, 
and break them into small bits ; strew salt equally over 
them, allowing a large table-spoonful to every quart of 
the pulp. Let them stand twenty-four hours; put all 
into a sauce-pan, and let it boil gently for three quarters 
of an hour ; strain, and let it stand to settle. The next day 
pour off the clear part, and to every pint of the liquor add 
half the quantity of port wine or old strong beer, a few 
blades of mace, twelve black peppercorns, and the same 
of allspice, a piece of ginger bruised, and eight cloves. 
Simmer it for nearly twenty minutes, pour it out, and 
when cold, bottle it with the spices equally divided. 

Another way to make Mushroom Catsup. 

Having cut out the stalks, and the worm-eaten parts, 
of the mushrooms, break them small, and strew over 
them some salt ; let them stand twenty-four hours. Strain 
off the liquor, and to a quart put the well-beaten whites 
of two or three eggs ; boil it, and run it through a flannel 
bag ; then boil it for about ten minutes with a little salt, 
three quarters of an ounce of black, and a quarter of an 
ounce of Jamaica pepper. When cold, bottle it with the 
apices, and seal the corks. 



PICKLES. 413 

Tomata Catsup. 

When tomatas are very ripe^ slice them and put a layer 
into a jar, sprinkle salt over it, and lay in another layer; 
<lo this till the jar is fall ; stir them now and then for 
three days, and let liie jar stand in a warm place ; they 
must then remain for twelve days without being stirred, 
and a thick scum having gathered over them, squeeze the 
juice from the tomatas, and boil it with the same propor- 
tion of spice that is allowed for mushroom catsup ; when 
cold, bottle it, and seal the corks. In three months strain 
and boil it again with fresh spice. It will then keep good 
a twelvemonth. 

Oyster Catsup. 

Boil one hundred oysters with their liquor, till the 
strength be extracted from them ; strain them well, and 
add to the liquor an equal quantity of wine, one half port 
and the other sherry, b\bq a quarter of an ounce of mace, 
the same of white pepper and of allspice, a drachm or 
tea-spoonful of ginger, and six anchovies ; boil all toge- 
ther about fifteen minutes. Put into a jar twelve shalots, 
the peel of a lemon, and a piece of horse-radish cut small ; 
pour upon them the boiling liquor, and when cold^ bottle 
it^ together with the spices. 

Prince of Wales's Catsup. 

Strip and fill a jar witli ripe elder-berries ; add as 
much vinegar as the jar will contain, put it into a cool 
oven, and let it stand all night. Run toe liquor through 
a jelly-bag, and to every pint put two ounces of ancho- 
vies, one of shalots ; of cloves, mace, nutmegs and ginger, 
a drachm or tea-spoonful each ; boil it till the anchovies 
are dissolved. When cold, strain and bottle it. 

Lemon Pickle. 

Cut into quarters, and pick out all the seeds of six 
middling-sized lemons ; put them into a jar, strew over 



414 victJJES. 

them two ounces of well-beaten bay salt ; cover the jar 
with a cloth and plate, and let it stand three days ; thea 
put to them six cloves, and a quarter of an ounce of mace, 
beaten fine, one ounce of garlic or shalot, two of mus- 
tard-seed bruised^ and one inutmeg sliced. Make a quart 
of vin^ar boiling hot. and pour it over the ingredients ; 
cover the jar, and in three or four days close it with a 
bung, and tie leather over it. It will be fit for use in a 
■week, and is an improvement to most sauces, and parti- 
cularly to fish sauce. 

Another way to make Lemon Pickle. 

Grate off a little of the outer rind of two dozen of 
lemons, divide them into four rather more than half way 
down, leaving the bottom part whole ; rub on them equal- 
ly half a poimd of finely-beaten bay salt, spread them 
upon a large dish, and put them into a cool oven. When 
the juice has dried up, put them into a stone jar, with an 
ounce of cloves and one of mace finely beaten, one ounce 
of nutmeg cut into thin slices, a quarter of an omic« of 
cayenne, and four oimces of garlic peeled, also half a pint 
of white mustard-seed bruised and tied in a bit of muslin. 
Pour over the whole two quarts of boiling vinegar, stop 
the jar closely, and let it stand for three months ; then 
strain it through a hair sieve, pressing it well through ; let 
it stand till the next day, pour off the clear, and put it into 
small bottles. Let the dregs stand covered some days, 
when it will become fine. It will keep good for years. 
When the lemons are to be used as a pickle, no straining 
is necessary. 

Another way to make Lemon Pickle. 

Cut into slices nine lemons, and put over them one 
pound of salt, two ounces of horse-radish sliced thin, the 
same of flour of mustard, half an ounce of white pepper; 
of cloves, nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, a quarter of an 
ounce each ; pound the spices, add three quarts of vine- 
gVy and boil the whole twenty minutes ; put it into a 



PICKLES. 415 

Jar, and let it stand tkree wedcs, stirring it daily ; then 
strain it throngh a sieve, and keep it for use in small bottlss. 

Yellow Pickle. 

Cut neatly into small pieces one large head of canli* 
flower, two of cahbage, six good-sized carrots, and a quart 
of French beans ; put salt over them^ and let them stand 
for twenty-four hours ; drain them upon sieves for the 
same length of time, and lay them upon cloths to dry for 
twelve days in the sun, or near the fire ; then mix with 
them a quart of small onions, and a quarter of a pound of 
garlic, and allow them all to dry for two days longer. Put 
the wh(^ into a large jar, with of white mvstard-seed and 
turmeric two ounces each, one ounce of white ginger, 
and two table-spoonfuls of currie-powder ; fill up the jar 
with boiling vinegar, cover it closely, and let it stand near 
the fire, or in a warm {^ace, for a few days,,when the 
pickle will be ready for use. If it be too thick, add more 
boiling vinegar. 

To Pickle Eggs. 

Boil twelve eggs for twelve minutes, dip them into 
cold water, and take off the shells ; boil a quart of viae^ 
gar for a quarter of an hour, with half an ounce each of 
black and Jamaica pepper, and ginger, also tome sfioes oi 
beet-root ; put in the eggs to boil for eight or ten mi- 
nutes, then put them into a jar with a slice of beet-root 
laid en ea^, and cover them with the vinegar and spices. 
They will be fit for use in four days, and are served in the 
following manner :^Place two or three in a dish, and put 
round them one or two cut into slices, then garnish with 
curled parsley. 

To Pickle Mushrooms. 

Cut off the stalks, and wash clean, in cold water, 
some small button mushrooms ; rub them with a bit of 
flatmel, then throw them into fresh water, and when per- 
fectly dean, put them into a saiice-p«n with fresh cold 



416 PICKLES. 

water, and let them boil ^ght or ten miniites ; strain off 
the water, lay them into the folds of a cloth. Boil, in a 
qaart of vinegar, a quarter of an ounce of white pepper, 
the same of allspice, and two or three blades of macey and 
a teft-spoonfnl of salt ; put the mushrooms into a jar, and 
when the vin^ar is cold, poor it, with the spices, over 
them. 

Another way to Pickle Mushrooms. 

Clean them nicely, put them into a jar, cover them 
with vinegar, add a little salt, white pepper, and allspice ; 
boil them in a water bath, or upon a hot plate, till the 
mushrooms are tender. Before bottling, put in a few 
fihalots ; cover them closely when cold. 

To Pickle Beet-Root 

Wash it perfectly clean, but do not cnt off any of the 
'fibres ; put it on in plenty of boiling water with a little 
salt, and boil it for half an hour ; if the skin will come off 
easily, it is done enough. Lay it upon a cloth, and with 
a coarse one rub off the skin. Cut it into slices, put it 
into a jar, and pour over it vinegar which has become 
cold, after having been boiled in the proportion of half 
an ounce of whole black pepper and a race of ginger to 
a quart. Cover the jar closely when cold. 

To Pickle Onions. 

Take off the outer skin of some small white onionf^ 
let them lie in salt-and-water for a week, changing it dai- 
ly ; then put them into a jar, and pour over them boiling 
«alt-and-water ; cover them closely, drain off the pickle 
when cold. Pat the onions into wide-mouthed bottles^ 
and fill them up with strong vinegar, putting in a little 
sliced ginger ; cork the bottles closely. 

To Pickle Young Onions. 

Choose some of the small silver onion, put them on 
in cold water, and when it is scalding hot, take them out 



PICiCLES. 417 

with an egg slice ; peel off the skins till tbey look white 
and clear ; lay them into the folds of a cloth. Boil, in a 
quart of vinegar, half an ounce of white pepper, a quarter 
of an ounce of allspice, the same of garlic, aud one sliced 
nutm^ ; put the onions into a jar, and pour ^v^r them 
the boiling vinegar and spices. When cold, tie leather 
over the jar. 

Another way to Pickle Young Onions. 

Peel some small onions, and steep them in salt-and- 
water for two days, changing the water two or three 
times; then drain them, and, when perfectly dry, put 
them into small jars, and pour over them, when cold, 
white wine vinegar which has been boiled with some 
whole black pepper and a few cloves. 

Hot Pickle. 

Boil, in two quarts of vinegar, a quarter of a pound 
of salt, two ounces of shalots or garlic, and two of gin- 
ger, one ounce of white pepper, one of yellow mustard-^ 
seed, and a quarter of an ounce of cayenne $ put into a 
jar that will hold four quarts, two ounces of sJlspice, and 
pour on it the hot pickle. When cold, put in any fresh- 
gathered vegetables or fruit, such as asparagus, cauli« 
flower, French beans, radish pods, unripe apples, goose- 
berries, currants, which may be added as the opportunity 
offers ; and, as the pickle wastes, it should be replenished 
with the same mixture* 

To Pickle Red Cabbage. 

Choose two middliug-sized, well-coloured, and firm 
red cabbages, shred them very finely, first pulling off the 
outside leaves ; mix with them nearly half a pound of salt,, 
tie it up in a tibin cloth, and let it hang for twelve hours ; 
then put it into small jars, and pour over it cold vinegar 
that has been boiled with a few barberries in it ; tie the 
jar over closely with bladder ; or boil, in a quart of vine- 
gar, three bits of ginger, half an ounce of black and Ja- 

'4d 



418 PICKXE6. 

iMiea pepper, and a quarter of an ounce of cloves. Wlien 
cold, ponr it over the red cabbage. 

To Pickle Barberries. 

Boil llie bndsed berries of a few bunches in salt-and- 
water ; strain, and put a gill of the liqnor to a quart of 
Tinegar, with an ounce of salt, a quarter of a pound of 
loaf sugar, a quarter of an ounce of pounded ginger, and 
a little sliced horse-radish ; boil and strain it, then ponr 
it hot over the barberries, the finest bunches having been 
previously selected and placed in jars ; when cold, cover 
them closely with bladder. They may also be kept in a 
jar^ with a strong brine of salt-and-water poured over 
them. When any scum is observed upon the surface, the 
brine must be poured off, and some fresh added. They 
are kept closely covered. 

To Pickle Green or Red Capsicums. 

Place the capsicums in a jar, boil a dessert-spoonful 
of salt in a quart of vinegar, and pour it, while hot, upon 
llie peppers ; when cold, place a plate on the jar, and tie 
over it bladder or leather. They will be fit for use in a 
few weeks. 

Indian Pickle. 

Scrape and wash a pound of white ginger ; cut it into 
thin slices, and put it into salt-and-water for one night ; 
then lay it upon a dish, strew salt over it^ and let it stand 
till the rest of the ingredients are ready. Cut into bits a 
pound of garlic, let it lie for three days in salt ; wash, 
drain, and dry it upon a sieve before the fire, or in the 
am ; boil^ for a quarter of an hour, in some salt-and-water, 
sene summer cabbages, cut them into quarters^ drain 
them, and strew on them some fineTy-mtnced fresh beef 
suet ; let them lie for twelve hours, then pull tliem into 
small bits, and dry them under glasses in the sun, so that 
no dust can get at them ; turn them constantly for three 
days, and if not quite dry, put them before the fire ; ihey 
should be like parchment. Boil, in salt-and-water, cauli- 



ncKLXs. 419 

flower, celery^ French beans, and sliced horse-radish ; pull 
the cauliflower into bits^ and cut the celery into pieces an 
inch long ; dry them iu the son, or by the fire. Finely 
bruise a quarter of a pound of mustard-seed and an ounce 
of turmeric ; add with it a quarter of a pound of long 
pepper, and the same of allspice, to a quart of the strong- 
est vinegar ; boil it, and add three quarts of common vine- 
gar ; pour it, when boiling hot, upon all the dried vege- 
tables placed in a jar. In three weeks, if the vinegar be 
much wasted, fill it up with more. The jar may be add- 
ed to, every year ; and the pickles keep good any length 
of time. 

To Pidde Artichoke Bottoms. 

Boil the artichokes till the leaves can be pulled off 
without breaking the bottoms ; leave on the part called 
the choke, set them aside tiU cold, then put them into 
wide-mouthed bottles. Boil, in yinegar, some salt^ while 
pepper, mace, and sliced nutmeg, and, when cold, pour 
it over the artichokes ; tie bladder over the bottles. 

Walnii* Pickle. 

Put any quantity of the otitmde shells or green rinds 
«f ripe walnuts into a tub in which there is a tap-h^e ; 
sprinkle them with water, raise the tub on ami -aide, .that 
it may stand in a sloping direction, place another iqissel 
under it to receive the juice as it drops from the lap-hole ; 
this it wiU soon begin to do; and, when a sufficient 
quantity ha* 'been obtained, to <Hie gallon of this black 
liquor add two lai^ table-spoonfuls of salt, one large 
onion, a stick of horse-radish, a bun^h of sweet herbs, 
two bay leaves, a quarter of an ounce of black pepper, 
the same of allspice and of bruised ginger. Boil it slowly 
for twenty minutes ; straioiiit, and, when cold, stir it and 
bottle it for use, putting the spice into the bottles.

CHAPTER XVlil. ' 



WINES. 

PREPARATORY REMARKS UPON DOMESTIC WINKS. 

All wines are reducible to four general divisions, of 
dry and strong ; sweet ; light and flavoured ; and brisk. 
When a dry wine is desired, the liquor is suffered to re- 
main in the vat for three, four, or more days, according to 
circumstances ; and a cask is provided for it sufficiently 
large to prevent the yeast from escaping at the bung- 
liole. To make a sweet wine, the fermentation must be 
discouraged by speedily removing it from the vat to the 
cask, which is carefully filled as the fluid subsides, and 
by Sequent racking or sulphuring, or by both. To pro- 
ddce a light flavoured wine, similar to burgundy, the 
fluid is allowed to remain from six to twenty hours in 
the vat ; and, for wines to resemble champagne, it is 
necessary the juice should remain in the vat but a few 
hours* Where small quanljiities are operated upon, the 
fermentation may be begtM^jj^jjIfie cask, the mask or mash 
being previously strained; for ia no case should solid 
matter be introduced into the cask. The wine is strong- 
est when the fermentation has been partially carried on 
in close vessels ; and the flavour is also better preserved. 



PREPARATORY REMARKS* 421 

To have a wine resemblmg champagne, apartiaUjr close 
ode of fermentation is adopted. For rich and strong 
sweet wines, the whole fermentation may be carried on 
openly; but, in air cases, it seems a useful practice to 
cover the vat with boards and blankets. The fermenta- 
tion is much soonen 'Completed in a large than in a small 
vessel. The sweeter and thicker juices require to be 
treated on a larger scale than the thinner ones. It is easy 
to make lemon wine in a cask of two gallons ; but it is a 
very difficult task to operate on so small a quantity of 
thick and sweet raisin wine. The most favourable temper- 
ature for fermentation is about 54 degrees of Fahrenheit. 
When it languishes from cold, a portion of the fluid may 
be heated to a high degree of temperature, and mixed 
with the mass. The sweetest wines are most durable, 
and are improved by keeping ; the thinnest and briskest 
ought to be drunk comparatively new. Boiling the fruit 
tends to make the wine sweet ; and white sugar should 
always be used in preference to brown. The introdiic<» 
tlon of brandy neither prevents wine from turning soar, 
nor does it add to its durability, while it increases the- 
expense, and diminishes its salubrity ; but, for those wfaa 
cannot overcome their prejudice in favour of established 
practices, it may be observed, that brandy will be least 
injurious when added before the fermentation is comple- 
ted, in the proportion of a quart to every ten gallons. 

The necessity of making the vats and casks clean re* 
quires to be particularly inculi^ted on the makers of do- 
mestic wines. The taste communicated by new casks 
is not usually thought unpleasant ; where it is so, first 
rinsing with hot salt-and-water, and afterwards with more 
hoi water, will remove it. Old and musty casks should 
be unheaded and scraped, then cleaned «a \»iw^ ^ys^rx*-

ed ; iliMi lastly, riiised wi^ a portion of the fermentiiig 
liqnor macb boiliBg hot* In remoYiiig the wtne fronfr the 
▼at to tke casks, it is requisite that the vat should be 
t^>ped a;t such a <tistanee from the bottom^ as to allow 
the wine to flow clear off the sediment which may have 
ooUected at the lower part of the vessel^ by which means 
the scam may be easily fH'evented from ronniog into the 
receiver. If the wine is not disengaged from the solid 
matters, straining will be farther necessary. The skins 
are sometimes ferm^iited wildi the jnice in the Tat, bat 
they most in no case be introduced into the cask* To 
clarify the wine completely, prepared fining* may be 
used in tiie proportion of a wine-glassfol to every five 
giUons of liqnor ; alsa isinglass or whites of eggs ; half 
an onnce of isinglass, or nine eggs, is sufficient for fifty 
gallonft of wine : windieyer of these is employed^ it is 
first diluted in a portion of the wine, and then strongly 
agitated with the whole. In about ten days, when the 
wine has become clear, it is again drawn oS, Instead of 
the common method of sulphuring, the sulphate of pot. 
ash is to be preferred^ which may be used in the propor- 
tion of a drachm* to a pipe of liquor, or the oxymuriate of 
potash, whicb is more easily procured. Dry, cold wea- 
ther ought to be selected for racking. 

Various kinds of wine, not to be distinguished from 
those of foreign growth^ can in this coontry be made from 
grapes, and at a moderate expense ; their being ripe is not 
a necessary eircamslance ; they may be used in any state, 
however immatwe, the quantity of sugar being propor- 
tionally increased* Where the vine is largely cultivated, 
the tbinninga SMiy be osedy as various kinds of grapes^

PaXPARATORY BEHARKS. 423 

aod of different degrees of ripeness, may be mixid to- 
gether. In situations where the vine may QOt produce 
even unripe fmit, the tendrils and leaves may be used, 
as they possess properties similar to the green fruit ; the 
leaves of the claret vine produce wine of a delicate red 
colour. 

Yeast should never be employed in making wine from 
native fruits. The deficiency of tartar in them, which in 
the grape promotes fermentation^ may be supplied by the 
addition of cream of tartar, or, what is still better, crude 
tartar. Should the fermentation be slow, or appear as If 
it would not occur at all, no impatience need be felt on 
the subject ; it will not finally be less effectual, because 
it has been more tedious. Attention to the temperature 
will commonly be sufficient. The cask may also be fire- 
quently stirred, or the filling up of the cask omitted^ so 
that the scum, or head, may be compelled to remain in the 
liquor. 



Gooseberry Wine to resemble Champagne. 

The fruit must be selected when about full grown, 
but before it has shown the least tendency to ripen ; those 
gooseberries which have the least flavour when ripe are 
to be preferred, and perhaps the green bath are the best ; 
the smallest should be separated by a sieve, the unsound 
or bruised fruit rejected, and the remains of the blossoms 
and fruit-stalks rubbed off, or otherwise removed. For 
a cask of ten gallons, forty pounds of such fruit are to be 
put into a tub that has been carefully cleaned, and that 
will hold fifteen or twenty galloa|.; it is to be bruised in 



4<24> DOMESTIC WINES, &C« 

« 

sucoMsiTe proportions, by a pressure sufficient to burst 
the berries without breaking the seeds, or materially com- 
pressing the skins. Four gallons of water are then to be 
poured into the vessel, and the contents ai*e to be care- 
fully stirred, and squeezed in the hand, until the whole 
of the juice and pulp are separated from the seeds and 
skins ; the materials are then to remain at rest from six 
to twenty-four hours, when they are to be strained through 
a coarse bag by as much force as can conveniently be ap- 
plied to them ; one gallon of fresh water may afterwards 
l>e passed through the mash. 

Thirty pounds of loaf sugar are now to be dissolved 
in the juice thus procured, and water added, to make the 
whole eleven gallons in quantity; this, together with 
three ounces of tartar in its crude state, being put into 
a tub, a blanket is thrown over it, which is again covered 
with a board, and the vessel placed in a temperature vary- 
ing from 55^ to 60° of Fahrenheit ; here it may remain 
for twenty-four hours, or two days, as the fermentation 
may be more or less rapid ; from this tub it is to be drawn 
off into the cask in which it is to ferment ; and, as the fer- 
mentation proceeds, the superfluous portion of juice made 
for the purpose, must be poured in, so as to keep the liquor 
still near the bung-hole for ten or twelve days^ or until the 
fermentation becomes a little languid, as may be known 
by the diminution of the hissing noise ; the bung is to be 
driven in, and a hole bored by its side, into which a wooden 
peg is to be fitted ; it may be loosened every two or three 
days, for the space of eight or ten days, to give the air 
vent, so as to prevent the cask from bursting. When 
there appears no longer any danger, the spike may be per- 
manently tightened. 

The wine thus made may remain over the winter in 
a cool cellar. If the operator is not inclined to bestow 
any farther labour or expense upon it, it may be ex- 
amined in some clear cold day towards the end of Fe- 
bruary or beginning of March, when, if fine, as it will 
sometimes be, it may be bottled without farther precau- 
tion. To ensure its fineness, however, it is a better prac- 



DOMESTIC WINES, &C. 425 

tice to rack it^ towards tbe end of December, into a fresh 
cask, so as to clear it from its first lees ; or should it then 
prove too sweet, instead of racking it, the fermentation 
may be renewed by stirring tip the lees, or by rolling the 
cask. At whatever time it is racked, it should be fined 
in tbe usual way with isinglass. Sometimes it is found 
expedient to rack it a second time, and to repeat the 
fining ; and, in any case, bottle it during the month of 
March. 

If it is wished to have a very swieet wine, as well as a 
brisk wine, the quantity of sugar may be increased to forty 
pounds ; and to ensure briskness, without excessive sweet- 
ness, the proportion of fruit may be fifty pounds when the 
sugar is thirty. If there should appear any danger of the 
sweetness vanishing altogether from wine thus formed, 
the fermentation may be checked by racking and fining, 
when it will be speedily fit for use. 

Wine from Unripe Currants, 

This fruit is perhaps better calculated for brisk wines 
than the gooseberry ; greater (fare must be taken in se- 
parating the stalks, but otherwise the mash is more easily 
managed. By working the juice and solid matter toge- 
ther in the vat along with the sugar, the wine will prove 
stronger, and less sweet, but it will acquire more flavour. 
When the skins are not to be fermented with the liquid, 
it may be introduced at once into the cask, without being 
previously fermented in the vat, and in all cases strained 
before it is put into the cask. The same proportions are 
allowed for this wine as for gooseberry wine, and the 
same rules may be followed. 

Sweet Wine from Ripe Currants. 

The fruit is gathered when quite ripe, and the stalks 
being carefully picked out, it is bruised in the hands, and 
then strained through a canvass bag ; to a ten-gallon cask^ 
forty pounds of fruit, thirty of sugar, and a quarter of a 
pound of tartar are allowed ; the material having remain- 
ed some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, it is re- 



426 DOMESTIC WINESf &C. 

moved to the cask^ tbe bung-hole covered with a tile, and 
the cask is stirred every other day^ for ten days^ and filled 
up every day as the fluid wastes^ The fermentation may 
continue from three to six weeks- ; when it has subsided, 
the wine is racked into a cask in which matches, dipped 
in snlphm*, have be«i burned^ or in which a little of the 
sulphate of potash^ or of oxymuriate of potash, has been 
pat» It should be i^ain racked and fined in March, when 
the wine is completed, and may be bottled, or allowed to 
remain in the cask« 

Ripe Gooseberry Wine 

May be made by Uie same rule, excluding carefully 
£rem it all the husks* 

Black Currant Wine. 

The same variety of pr<^portions are allowed in this 
as in the others already mentioned. The fruit being 
picked, it is brought to tbe boHing point in as much wa- 
ter as to avoid any risk of burning ; it may then be 
strained and put into the cask, or the liquid and skins 
nay, with the other ingredients, be first fomented in tbe 
vat or tub, by which the wine will acquire a higher colour 
and flavour* 

Strawberries and Raspberries. 

From either of these fruits agreeable wine may be ob- 
tained, by following the rules given for making curraat 
wine ; but it will l^ found a cheaper and a better method, 
to add a little sirup or juice of the fruit to any flavoor- 
less currant wine ; when the fermentation begins to de- 
cline, currant wine may also be flavoured with odoriferons 
flowers^ rach as cowslip, elder, or mignionette. The qua- 
lity of roughness is communicated by catechu and keno, 
chips of oak and of beech, and also the sloe ; a small 
quantity of these, or of the flowers, is put into the caik 
when the first fermentation is over, and as soon as the 
wine has acquired the desired flavour, it is racked and 
fined. The flavouring articlo8» such a» orri»-root, cloves, 



DaMEaxic wiNfi8, &e. 43T 

ginger, sweet and bitter almonds, are put into a muslin 
bag, and hung in the cask for a few days, during the stage 
of insensible fermentation, that is, after the first fermen- 
tation has ceased, care being taken to taste the liquor £r»- 
quendy, so that the flavouring matter may be withdrawn 
as soon as it has produced the desired effect. 

Elderberries 

Can be made to produce excellent wine, allowing to a 
ten-gallon cask forty pounds of fruit, forty pounds •f su- 
gar, and a quarter of a pound of tartar. When elderberry 
wine is desired for a warm cordial, it is made in the follow- 
ing manner:— -Twenty-five pounds of fruit are to be boiled 
for an hour, in eleven gallons of water, and along with- k^ 
tied in a piece of linen, one ounce of allspice, and tw» of 
ginger ; forty poimds of sugar being put into a tab, th&boilv- 
ing liquor is strained over it, pressing the fruit quite dry ; 
a quarter of a pound of crude tartar, or cream of tartar, is 
then added to the liquid. When it baa stood two days 
in the tub, it may be removed to the cask, treated, as i«ff 
sweet wine, in the osual manner^ and bottled in Marck 
following. When to be drunk, a portion o£ it is heated 
with some sugar, two or three clov«8, anda little nutmegs 

Wine from'^Mixed Fruit. 

The three varieties of currant may be used kk the 
largest proportion, and being nicely picked from the stalks, 
they are allowed just to Boil in as* much water as to pre- 
vent their burning ; of raspberries,^ strawberries,, and cher- 
ries — black-heart are the best — equal quantities may be 
allowed; they are masked with a little water; goose- 
berriesr may be used to advantage, but must. bAr prepared 
separately by more powerful bruising, in an equal quaur 
tity of water, and straining through a canTass bag, the 
other fruits being also strained ; to each gallon of juice 
thus obtained, four pounds of loaf sugar, and half an 
ounce of crude tartar, are allowed; when the material 
has stood some hours in the tub in which it was mixed, 
it is removed to the cask, and muiaged as currant wine. 



428 DOMESTIC WINES, &C. 

Wine £rom Unripe Grapes. 

The proportions and treatment are exactly the same as 
those laid down for the gooseberry, only that the husks 
may always be fermented in the vat with the fluids and 
also the stems when young ; with the exception of the 
seeds, there is no objection to braising the solid matters. 

Wine from Vine Leaves. 

The leaves are best when yonng; at farthest they 
should not be fall grown, and mnst be plucked with their 
stems ; the tendrils are equally useful ; they may be taken 
from vines from which no fruit is expected, or from the 
summer prunings ; when tainted with soot, they must be 
carefully washed. Forty or fifty pounds of such leaves 
being put into a tub, seven or eight gallons of boiling wa- 
ter are to be poured on them, in which they are to infuse 
for twenty-four hours ; the liquor being poured off, the 
leaves must be pressed in a press of considerable power ; 
and being then washed with an additional gallon of wa- 
ter, they are again to be pressed. Thirty pounds of sugar, 
and a quarter of a pound of tartar, are now to be added 
to the mixed liquor, and the quantity being made up to 
seven gallons, the process recommended in the case of 
gooseberries is to be followed ; or that for ripe currants, 
if a sweet wine is desired. 

Raisin Wine. 

To every gallon of water, eight pounds of good raisins, 
and half an ounce of tartar, are allowed ; the raisins being 
picked, they are to be put, together with the tartar, into 
a tub, which should be covered ; the mash must be stir- 
Ted every day till the sweetness has gone off, and the fruit 
bas fallen a little, which may be in a month or six weeks ; 
it is then to be strained, the raisins pressed to dryness, 
and the liquid put into the cask ; no filling up is neces- 
sary, and the bung-hole is only to be so covered as to keep 
out the dust. When the wine has given over hissing, it 
is to be bunged down till the spnng, when it is to be care- 



DOMESTIC WINES, &C* 42^ 

fully fined and racked into a Bolphured cask, and bottled, 
after being once more carefully fined. 

Another way to make Raisin Wine. 

For a ten-gallon cask, fifty pounds of Malaga, and 
twenty-five of Smyrna raisuis, ten pounds of loaf sugar, 
and a quarter of a pound of crude tartar, are allowed. The 
raisins being separated from each other, and the strong 
stalks picked out, they are to be put, together with the 
other ingredients, into a vat, and thirteen gallons of cold 
spring water are to be poured over them ; the whole is theu 
to be well stirred, and the vat covered ; it must be stirred 
twice a-day during the first fortnight, and afterwards once 
a-day. When the fermentation has become very strong, 
and the liquor acquires a vinous smell and taste, which 
may be in three or four weeks, it is to be prepared for the 
cask in the following manner : — A sieve or a drainer, such 
as is used for sowens in Scotland, is to be put over a tub ; 
in this the raisins are to be squeezed very hard with the 
hand ; all the liquor is then to be run thi'ough a hair sieve, 
and put into the cask, and the remainder into bottles, from 
whidi the cask must be filled up twice a-day for a week ; 
then once a-day, and less frequently as the fermentation 
begins to decline ; when it is completed, the cask is to be 
bunged up, and allowed to stand for four months. £x« 
cellent vinegar may be made from the refuse. 

Another way to make Raisin Wine. 

To twenty-eight gallons of water, one hundred and 
twelve pounds of Malaga, and twenty-eight pounds of 
Smyrna raisins, are allowed ; the stalks b^og picked out, 
they are to be chopped very small, and with the water, 
and one poimd of crude tartar, put into a tub, in which 
they are allowed to remain for a fortnight. The raisins are 
then to be squeezed to dryness, and the liquor strained, 
put into a cask, and treated as wine from ripe currants. 

Orange Wine. 

For a ten-gallon cask, ninety bitter oranges are to be 
pared very thin, and the jmce 8q(ueez^^o\a>3Ei^\si,VcA^-,

with «iz gaUoM of water and twenty-eigbt pounds of su- 
gar, is pnt into the <»sk ; half the peel may he steeped 
in two gallons of water for twelve hours, and the water 
poured into the cask ; they are again to be steeped m the 
lamaining quantity -of water, with which the cask is to be 
filled up ; it must he stirred every day till the sugar « 
dinolved, and bunged up when the fermentation ceases. 
Li two months it may be racked and fined, and in three 
months more bottled. 

Those who think brandy necessary, may add a bottle 
at tike end o( the 'first two months. 

The wine will be more generaUy agreeable if the peel 
be altogether cnnitted. 

Lemoa Wine. 

To «very gallon of water, four pounds of sugar, and 
ite juice of ten lemons, are allowed ; the lemons are to be 
pared very thin, and half the peel bemg put into a tub, 
the sugar and water are boiled and poured over it ; when 
eold, the jmce is added ; if the fermentation does not be- 
gin in the course of a few days, it is to be promoted by 
the addition of a toast of bread covered with yeast ; the 
peel is then taken out, and the liquor put into the cask, 
which must be bunged up when the fermentation ceases. 

In this, as in orange wine, the peel may be omitted. 

Malt Wine. 

Thirty pounds of sugar 'are to be boiled half an hour 
with ten gallons of water, and well skimmed ; when milk- 
warm, five gallqas of new ale, from the vat, are added to 
it, and it is allowed to ferment two days in a tub ; it is 
then put into the cask, with one pound of sagarcandy 
pomaded, and four pounds of rtiisins of the san chopped. 
When the fermentation ceases, it is racked and fined. 

It may be bottled at the end of six or twelve months. 

Parsnip Wine.

whole or in a pordon of the water ; when quite soft, they 
are to be taken out and mashed, then returned to the wa- 
ter they were boiled in, and being well stirred, are put 
through A hair sieve ; the Augar is then to be added to the 
strained liquor, and the quantity made up with boiled wa- 
ter ; when nearly cold, it is to be put into the cask with 
two spoonfuls of yeast, and three ounces of crude tartar, 
and stirred every day till the fermentation subsides, which 
may be in ten days or a fortnight ; it is then bunged up, 
and may be racked and fined in three or six montibs, and 
bottled in six months more. 

Birch Wine. 

To every gallon of juice from the birch-tree, three 
pounds of sugar, one pound of raisins, half an ounce of 
crude tartar, and one ounce of almonds, are allowed ; the 
juice, sugar, and raisins, are to be boiled twenty minutes^ 
and then put into a tub, together with the tartar ; and 
when it has fermented some days, it is to be strained, and 
put into the cask, and also the almonds, which must be 
tied in a muslin bag. The fermentation having ceased, the 
almonds are to be withdrawn, and the cask bunged up, 
to stand about five months, when it may be fined and 
bottled. 

Ginger Wine. 

To eight gallons of water, twelve pounds of sugar, 
three pounds of bitter oranges, five pounds of lemons, and 
thirteen ounces of ginger, are allowed ; the sugar and the 
ginger, bruised, are to be boiled with the wixer half an 
hour, and allowed to stand till next day ; the fruit i& to 
be par^d very thin, and the strained juice, and half the 
peel, put into a cask with two gallons and a half of good 
whisky, or other spirit ; when it has stood a night, the 
clear part of the boiled liquid is to be poured over it, the 
sediment being kept back ; it does not ferment, and there- 
fore it is not necessary that the cask should be full ; it lA 
immediately bunged up, and in a fortnight it must be fine^ 
and in another fortnight it may be bottled. To improve 



432 DOMESTIC WINES, &C. 

the colour, a table-spoonful of burnt sugar may be added 
when the cask is filled up, first dilating it with a portion 
of the liquon 

Another way to make Ginger Wine. 

Sixteen pounds of brown sugar, and the well-beaten 
whites of six eggs, are to be stirred into six gallons of 
water, and put on the fire to boil ; the scum having well 
risen, it is to be taken dear off, and six ounces of the 
best white ginger, cut small, are to be added ; it is then to be 
boiled for three quarters of an hour, and well scummed ; 
when it has become milk-warm, it is to be put into a 
wooden vessel, together with a tea-cupful of fresh yeast, 
and also the juice of six lemons, and the same of Seville 
oranges, made into a sirup. When it has fermented for 
three days, it is to be put into the cask, with two bottles 
of brandy or four of whisky ; the fermentation being-over, 
it is bunged up, but not very tight at first. It may be 
fined in eight or ten weeks, and bottled, or allowed to 
stand in the cask nine or ten months. 

Another way to make Ginger Wine. 

For a ten-gallon cask, three gallons of spirits, whisky, 
or rum, one ^lon of the juice of Seville oranges, half a 
gallon of lemon juice, twenty pounds of loaf sugar, one 
pound and a half of best white ginger bruised, and half 
an ounce of isinglass, are allowed ; the cask is to be filled 
up with cold boiled water, and in six weeks it may be 
bottled. 

Another way to make Ginger Wine. 

To ten gallons of water, fourteen pounds of J^rowu 
sugar, a pound and a half of ginger, three gallons of 
whisky, the juice of three dozen lemons, and three dozen 
bitter oranges, and six rinds of each fruit, are allowed ; 
the sugar and water is to be boiled, stirring it frequently, 
and skimming it ; the ginger is to be boiled separately, in a 
small quantity of water, and strained; the rinds are to 
be steeped in the spdtA all night, and the boiled liquid 



DOMESTIC WINBSi &C. 43^ 

being cold, the whole is to be put into the cask, together 
with two drops of isinglass. In six weeks it may be 
bottled. 

Vinous Mead. 

To one gallon of water allow three pounds of honey ; 
boil the mixture for a quarter of an hour ; skim it, and 
when nearly cold, pour it gently into a cask, in which 
crude tartar has been put in the proportion of an ounce 
to the gallon. 

As the fermentation may be long continued, a large 
portion of the liquid must be reserved for filling up the 
cask ; it is put into bottles, which are closed with muslin 
or coarse linen. To excite fermentation, expose the cask 
to the influence of the sun, or put it into the comer of a 
chimney in which a constant fire is kept. In about seven 
or eight days, the liquor emits a thick and dirty froth ; 
the ban'el must then be filled up from the bottles, and 
when the fermentation ceases, the cask must be bunged 
up, and placed in the cellar. It may be bottled in twelve 
months. It is sometimes flavoured with flowers, or with 
the juice of fruits. 

Another way to make Mead. 

For a ten-gallon cask allow twenty pounds of honey, 
and fourteen gallons of water ; boil and skim it ; then 
add one ounce of cinnamon^ one ounce of cardamoms^ 
one and a half ounce of Jamaica pepper, two ounces of 
ginger, a quarter of an ounce of coriander seed, two large 
pieces of orris-root, and a few sliavings of isinglass ; bolt 
these ingredients for about half an hoar, and when the 
mixture has cooled, stir in a wine-glassful of yeast ; next 
day pour it through a cloth into the cask, and allow it to 
ferment for about ten days ; in a fortnight more it may be 
bottled, and the corks sealed. A variety of this mead 
may be made by adding a gallon of cranberry juice to the 
boiled honey and water, and substituting two ounces of 
cloves for the coriander and the cardamom seeds.

Simple Mead. 

One part of honey is dissolved in three parts of wster, 
and boiled over a moderate fire till it is reduced to two- 
thirds of the quantity. It is then skimmed, and put into 
a bnrel^ which must be qvhe full ; it is allowed to subside 
for three or four days, and then drawn off for use. 

To make it from the combs from which honey has 
been drained, they are to be beaten in warm water^ and 
after the liquor has subsided, it is to be strained. 

The cottagers in Scotland make an excellent beer by 
adding a little yeast to the strained liquor, and allowing it 
to ferment for a few days in a cask, and then bottling it. 

Orgeat. 

A QUARTER of a pound of sweet» and one ounce and a 
half of bitter almonds^ are to be blanched, and thrown into 
cold water^ then beaten in a marble mortar, and moisten- 
ed occasionally with a spoonful of milk, to prevent their 
oiling ; three pints of milk are then to be mixed gradu- 
ally with them, and after being sweetened, boiled, stirred 
till cold, and strained, a glass of wine or brandy is to be 
added. 

Another way to make Orgeat. 

One pound of Jordan almonds are to be finely pounded, 
together with a little orange-flower water ; two quarts of 
spring water being added by degrees, it is to be sweet- 
ened with double-refined sugar, strained through a nap- 
kin, and put into quart bottles, which should be iced. It 
must be made the day on which it is to be used. 

Cherry Brandy. 

The proportions are three quarts of the best brandy, 
six pounds of morella cherries, and a pound and a half of 
finely-pounded white or brown sugarcandy ; the cherries

sufficient quantity of sirup to coi^r them being made, 
they are to be scalded in it on the fire, and put away till 
next day, when they are again to be scalded, and put in- 
to a jar ; the sirup is then to be boiled till very thick, 
and if the quantity is not sufficient^ more sugar may be 
added ; when boiled enough, it is to be poured into the 
jar, with an equal quantity of brandy. 

Shrub. 

One measure of lemon juice is allowed to five of mm# 
and to every gallon of the mixture, six pounds of loaf su- 
gar, which is to be melted in water, and the whole strain- 
ed through flannel. 

Another way to make Shruh. 

To one part of lemon juice, three of Seville orange are 
allowed, and to every pint of juice, a pound and a half 
of very finely pounded loaf sugar ; these being well mix- 
ed, it is put into a cask, and one quart of tbe best rum 
jidded to each pint of tbe juice ; the whole to be shaken 
three times a-day for a fortnight, or longer, if the cask be 
large. It is then allowed to stand to fine for a month, or 
till it be sufficiently clear to bottle. 

The dregs may be mado into excellent milk punchy by.

Three quarts of brandy being put into an earthen jar 
that is fitted with a cover, a pound and three quarters of 
"fine loaf sugar, the thin parings of six lemons, and the 
juice of twelve, are to be added ; one quart of boiling milk 
is to be poured over the mixture, which must be stirred 
daily for eight days ; it is then to be run through a jelly- 
bag, and bottled. 

Lemonade. 

Eight lemons and eighty-four Seville oranges being 
selected, the two clearest lemons are to be rubbed over 
with loaf sugar, and the rinds scraped off into a gallon of 
spring water ; the fruit is then to be squeezed into a sieve 
placed over the vessel containing the water, the liquid 
sweetened with double-refined sugar and run through a 
jelly-bag. It is then to be put into bottles, which may be 
cooled, by laying ice oiv the necks. 



DOMESTIC WINE8, &C. 43T 

Transparent Lemonade. 

The peel of fourteen lemons having been soaked in 
two quarts of water for two hours, their juice, one pound 
and a half of sugar, and a quart of white wine, are to be 
added ; a quart of new milk, made boiling hot, is then to 
be mixed with it, and when it has stood an hour, it is to 
be strained through a jelly-bag till it runs clear. 

A Receipt for Juice. 

The proportion of oranges should be double that of 
lemons ; the fruit being selected free from decay, and 
wiped dry, they are to be squeezed, and the juice strain- 
ed through a sieve into an earthen pan ; to each pint, ac- 
cording to the acidity of the fruit, a pound and a half, or 
a pound and three quarters, of double-refined sugar, bro- 
ken small, is to be added. It must be stirred and skim- 
med daily, till the sugar is well incorporated, or as long 
as the scum rises ; and when it has been a month in the 
pan, it may be bottled. 

The Duke of Norfolk's Punch. 

Ths thin parings of six lemons^ and of six oranges, 
are to be steeped in a gallon of brandy for twenty-four 
hours, the vessel containing it being closely covered; 
three pounds of single-refined sugar are to be clarified 
with the white of an egg^ in a gallon of spring water, and 
boiled for a quarter of an hour, skimmed, and allowed to 
stand till cold. The brandy is then to be strained from 
the parings, and with the strained juice of eighteen oranges 
and eighteen lemons, added to the boiled sirup, and put 
into a vessel sufficiently large to contain the whole. It 
must be doealy covered, and when it has stood six weeks, 
it may be bottled.

of new milk, made boiling hot^ being added, it is to be 
strained through a jelly-bag. 

Another way to make Milk Punch. 

In twenty quarts of brandy, the peel of thirty Seville 
oranges, and thirty-six lemons, are to be infused for 
twelve hours ; thirty quarts of water and fifteen pounds 
of double-refined sugar are to be boiled, and when cold, 
the strained juice of the oranges and lemons is to be 
added to it ; it is then to be put into a cask, t<^ther 
with the brandy, strained from the peel ; a quart of boil- 
ing milk being poured into the cask, it is to be bunged 
up, and allowed to stand till it become fine, before being 
bottled. It will be the better for remaining a year in the 
cask. 

Another way to make Milk Punchi 

Eight pounds of refined sugar are to be dissolved in 
the strained juice of three dozen lemons, and, when quite 
settled, two gallons of brandy, and two gallons and a half

one gallon of boiling milk being then poured over the in- 
gredients, they are to stand closely covered for twenty- 
four hours ; when, being skimmed, and run through a very 
thick jelly-bag, it may be quickly bottled, and will be fit 
for immediate use ; but it improves by keeping. 

Katafia. 

One gallon of brandy, three hundred kernels of apri- 
cots, the juice and very thin parings of eight lemons, and 
half an ounce of safiron ; when these ingredients have

eight cloves are to be stuck into each orange, which, witk 
the spirits and sugar, is to be put into a jar. It must be 
closely covered, and stirred occasionally in the course of 
two months ; it is then to be filtered through blotting pa- 
p^, and bottled for use. 

Lemon liqueur is made in the same way, substituting 
lemons for oranges. Instead of mixing tbe sugar with the 
other materials in the jar, it may be made into a sirup, 
and added to the strained or filtered spirits. This, thongh 
more^trouUesome, will be found a better method. 

Noyau. 

The rinds of three large lemons, half a pound of pound- 
ed loaf sugar, one ounce of bitter almonds, blanched and 
pounded, are to be nixed into a quart of the best Hol- 
lands, three table-^»oonful8 of boQmg milk being added.

gether with half a pint of pure honey. 

It is sometimes coloured with a little cochineal ; and 
may also be made, allowing three parts of sweet, and one 
of bitter almonds. 

Capillaire. 

The best capillaire is that of North America. Put one 
ounce of it into a small quantity of boiling water, to in- 
fuse like tea ; add a pound of sugar to the infusion^ cla- 
rify it with the white of an egg, and boil it to a thick 
sirup ; strain it through a cloth, and when cold, put in a 
little orange-flower water, and bottle it. That whlbh is 
commonly sold as capillaire in England is simply sirup 
flavoured with orange-flower water. 

Hawthorn Liqueur. 

The full blossoms of the white thorn are to be picked 
dry and clean from the leaves and stalks, and as much 
put into a large bottle as it will hold lightly without press- 
ing it down ; it is then to be filled up with French bran- 
dy, and allowed to stand two or three months, when it 
must be decanted ofl^, and sweetened with clarified sugar, 
or with capillaire. Without the sweetening, it is an ex- 
cellent seasoning for puddings and custards. 

Caledonian Liqueur,

bottled next day, and will be fit for drinking the day after 
it is bottled. 

Another way to make Imperial. 

Two ounces of cream of tartar, the juice and parings 
of two lemons, and a few cloves, are put into a jar, and 
six quaits of boiling water added ; it is sweetened with 
loaf sugar, covered, and allowed to stand till the follow- 
ing day, when a quart of rum is added ; it is then strain*

pale brown colour ; lay them in a tureen, and put over 
them half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, and three glass* 
es of claret ; place the cover on the tureen, and let it 
stand till next day. When required for use, put the 
tureen into a pan of boiling water, press the oranges with 
a spoon, and run the juice through a sieve ; then boil the 
remainder of the bottle of claret, taking care that it do

warm, is to be poured over it, and four or five table-spoon^ 
fuls of thick yeast added. The cask must be filled up 
morning and evening with what works over it, and bung- 
ed up when the fermentaticm ceases ; in a month the beer 
may be bottled, and in two or three months it will be fit 
fw drinking. Half the quantity of the flower of lemon 
balm will prc^ably be foimd to comnmnicate a flavour suf- 
ficiently strong, if added when the ferflnentati<m is nearly

Medicinal Imperial, a favourite Spring 

Drink. 

One ounce of cream of tartar, one «ance of Epsom

Another way to make Soda Water. 

Cakbonate of soda, forty-five grains, tartaiic acid, 
thirty grams ; put each powder with^ quarter of a pint 
of cold water into se^^arate tumblers, and mix them well ; 



DOMESTIC WIMCS, hc. 443 

then pour the one containing the soda into that which hv 
the acid in it, and drink it while it effervesces. Some 
persons prefer the citric to the tartaric acid, and a smaller 
quantity of it will suffice. For those who are deiicate, or 
in Tcry cold weather, a small quantity of brandy, or of 
white wine, may be added ; and the water may be used 
in a tepid state. As a tonic, the carbonate of soda may 
be taken first, and the acid mixture instantaneously after* 
wards, by which means a powerful and salutary efferves- 
cence is produced in the stomacL 

Spruce Beer. 

When ten gallons of water, six pounds of treacle, and 
three ounces of bruised ginger, have boiled together for 
half an bour, two pounds of the outer sprigs of the spruce 
fir are to be added, and boiled for five minutes ; tbe whole 
is then to be strained tbrongb a hair siere, and when 
milk-warm, put into the cask, and a tea-cupful of good 
yeast stirred well into it. When it has fermented a day 
or two, it is to be hunged up, and the following day bet- 
tied. It will be fit for use in a week. 

The ginger is sometimes omitted, and instead of ^ne 
spruce £r, three ounces of the essence may be used, 
which is to be well whisked, together with the treacle, 
and a gallon or two of warm water ; then put into the 
cask, wiiich is to be filled up with water, and the yeast 
added. 

Another way to make Spruce Beer.

three ounces of hops, three ounces and a half of the es- 
sence of spruce, and half a pint of good yeast. The hops, 
ginger^ and allspice, must be boiled together till the hops 
fall to the bottom ; the treacle and spruce are then to be 
dissolved in a bucketful of the liquor, the whole strained 
into a cask, and the yeast well stirred in ; when the fer- 
mentation ceases, the cask is to be bunged up.

teen pounds of sugar, the juice of eighteen lemons, and 
one pound of ginger, are allowed; the sugar and water are 
boiled with the whites of eight eggs, and well skimmed ; 
just before coming to tbe boiling point, the ginger, which 
must be bruised, is then added, and boiled for twenty 
minutes ; when cold, the clear part is put into the cask, 
together with the lemon juice and two spoonfuls of yeast ; 
when it has fermented for three or four days, it is fined, 
bunged up, and in a fortnight bottled. It may be made 
without the fruit. 

Another Ginger Beer Quickly Made. 

A GALLON of boiling water is poured over three quar- 
ters of a pound of loaf sugar, one ounce and a quarter 
of sliced ginger, and the peel of one lemon ; when milk- 
warm, the juice of the lemon and a spoonful of yeast are 
added. It should be made in the evening, and bottled 
next morning in half-pint stone bottles, and the cork tied 
down with twine.

MISCELLANY. 



Permanent Ink. 

Rub down, in a small mortar, five icraples of lunar 
caustic, with one drachm of gumarabic, one scruple of sap 
green, and one ounce of rain water. 

Liquid Pounce. 

One ounce of sal-soda is to be mixed with two ounces 
of boilins: water, and a little gumarabic ; shake the bottle, 
wet the linen with the mixture, dry and iron it before 
using the ink, and again put the iron on it after it is 
marked. 

Almond Paste. 

Pound and mix thoroughly the following ingredients : 
One pound of raisins stoned ; two pounds of bitter almonds 
blanched; sixpence- worth of camphor; a wine-glass of 
brandy ; one of honey ; two beaten eggs, and a little fine 
sand sifted. 

Another way to make Almond Paste. 

Finely pound, and well mix, with a sufficient quan- 
tity of orange-flower or rose water, half a pound of bit- 
ter, one pound of sweet almonds blanched, and one pound 



44l6 MISCEIXANT. 

of honey ; put it into small pots^ and pour over it a littl& 
orange-flower or rose water ; tie them over closely with 
paper. 

Lavender Water. 

Put into a large bottle, eight ounces of the best recti- 
fied spirit of wine, three drachms of oil of lavender, one 
drachm of essence of ambergris, and threepence-worth of 
musk ; cork it tighdy, and ahake it well every day, for a 
fortnight or three weeks. 

To make Ink 

To four ounces of bruised galls, allow two of copperas, 
and two of gumarabic ; put the galls into a large bottle, 
with three pints of rain water, and in three or four days 
dissolve the gum in hot water, and add it with the cop- 
peras ; shake the bottle frequently for some days. A few 
doTes may be put into the bottle to prerent the ink from 
moulding.. 

To take out Iron Moulds. 

Pound two ounces of cream of tartar, and mix tJio- 
rougfaly with it one ounce of salt of sorrel ; keep it in a 
bottle closely corked. Fill a metal water-plate with boil- 
ing water ; wet the iron mould ; place it upon the plate^ 
and rub it with a little of the powder till it disappears ; 
then rinse it in water. Or mix in a tea-cup one tea-spoon- 
ful of oil of vitriol, and two of common salt ; place it in 
warm ashes ; hold the stained part over it, and the stain 
will soon disappear ; then wash the part in cold water. 

Neats' Foot Oil. 

BoiB the feet for several hours, as for making stock for 
jelly; skim off the oily matter from time to time as it 
rises, and when it ceases to come up, pour off the water ; 
next day take off the cake of fat and oil which will be 
found on the top ; boil it and the oil before obtained, to- 
gether with a little cold water ; let it cool ; pour off the 
water, and boUlfi die oil for use. This oil, beiog perfect-

ly pure, and frel^froBi smelly msf be used witb the French 
%ht» in a ack room^ 

To Discharge all Stains which are not 

Metallic. 

Mix two tea-spoonfals of water wfth one of spirit of 
salt ; let the stain lie in it for one or two minutes ; then 
rinse the article in cold water. This will be found par- 
ticularly useful in removing stains from white doilys. Or^ 
to remove port wine stains^ cover them thickly, while wety 
with salt, and instantly immerse the article in boiling wa^ 
ter ; repeat the process if the stains do not disappear at 
firsts 

To Wash Paint. 

Brush off the dust with a smaU long-haired brush ; 
mix finely-powdered whitening and bullock's gall, till of 
the consistence of a batter ; with a flannel rub it on the 
walls up and down, and then wash it off with a ele«i 
flannel and plenty of cold wat^r, and when nearly dry, 
rub it hard with a clean linen cloth ; the unpleasant smell 
from the gall will go off almost immediately. If the paint 
is not very much soiled, it may be washed merely with 
the whitening mixed with cold water, first wetting below 
the hand. 

To Wash Imitation Wainscot. 

Wash first with cold water and a clean flannel^ aad 
then with sour porter ; after which it is not to be wiped. 
Or wash with whitening mixed with cold water ; wash 
off with clean water ; dry it well, and then rub hard with 
linseed oil. 

To Clean Papered Rooms. 

Blow off the dust with a pair of bellows ; cut the up* 

Eer crust off a stale loaf of bread ; hold the crust in the 
and, and rub gently downwardsi about half a yard at 
each stroke^ Tlw aext time of goijig round, commence 



448 MISCELLANY. 

a little aboYe where the last stroke ended, and take care 
not to cross the paper, or go np again. The process may 
be repeated ; and, if carefully done, the paper will look 
nearly as well as new. 

To Clean Polished Grates and Irons. 

Make into a paste, with cold water, four pounds of 
putty-powder, and one of finely-powdered whitening ; dip 
a duster into the mixture ; rub off carefully all the spot^ 
and with a well-aired clean duster, rub the grate or irons 
one way till bright and clear. Plain dry whitening will 
keep it highly polished, if well attended to every day. 
The putty mixture should be used only to remove spots. 
To remove rust from the poker, tongs, and shovel, boil 
one pound of middling-sized emery powder with half a 
pound of soft soap, till it is as thick as paste ; when cold, 
rub the irons with it ; rub it off with a dry cloth, and 
polish with finely-powdered and sifted brick dust, or 
whitening. 

To keep steel grates, fenders, and fire-irons from rust- 
ing, rub them over with fresh mutton suet, melted^ and 
then dust them with unslaked lime, tied up in a bit of 
•Toarse muslin. 

To Clean Brass and Copper. 

Hub it over slightly with a bit of flannel dipped in 
sweet oil ; next, rub it hard with another bit dipped in 
finely-powdered rotten-stone ; then make it clean with a 
soft linen cloth, and finish by polishing it with a plate- 
leather. 

Another way to Clean Brass and Copper. 

Put one pennyworth of powdered rotten-stone into 
a dry dean quart bottle ; nearly fill it up with cold soft 
water ; shake it well, and add one pennyworth of vitriol. 
Kub it on with a rag, and dry it with a clean soft cloth, 
and then polish it with a plate-leather. This mixture will 
keep for a loi^ time, and becomes better the longer it is 



MISCELLANY. 449 

kept. But the first method gives the most lasting polish, 
as well as the finest colour. 

For Scouring Floors. 

Dry some fuller s earth, and with boiling water make 
it into a thick paste ; mix it with one-third of its quantity 
of rery fine sand, sifted ; sprinkle this mixture over the 
floor, and with a scrubbing-brush and cold water, scrub 
the boards up and down, but not across, and finish by 
scrubbing with plenty of cold water. Very fine sand and 
cold water may be used in general ; and to extract grease, 
mix some pearl ashes in hot water, and use it with fine 
sand. Equal proportions of spirits of salt, andof vin egar, 
mixed, will extract all stains out of floors. 

To Wash Stone Stairs and Halls. 

- Wash them first with hot water and a clean flannel, 
and then wash them over with pipe-clay mixed in water* 
When dry, rub them with a coarse flannel. 

To take Oil and Grease out of Floors and 

Stone Halls. 

Make a strong infusion of potash with boiling water ; 
add to it as much quick^lime as will make it of the con- 
sistence of thick cream ; let it stand a. night, then pour 
off the clear part, which is to be bottled for use. Whea 
wanted, warm a little of it ; pour it upon the spots, and 
after it has been on them for a few minutes, scour it off 
with warm water and soap, as it is apt to discolour the 
boards when left too long on them. When put upon 
stone, it is best to let it remain all night ; and if the stain 
be a very bad one, a little powdered hot lime may be put 
upon it before the infusion is poured on. 

To Clean Floor Qoths. 

Sweep them clean, and wash off any dirty spots with 
a spunge and cold- water, then mb them with a coarse 
flannel, and polish with a clean one.

450 MISCELLANY. 

To Prevent Creaking Hinges. 

Rub them with soft 8oi^> or a feather dipped in sweet 
oil. 

To Destroy Bugs. 

Mix one ounce of corrosive sublimate with a pint of 
spirits of wine ; shake it well, and, with a feather, rab it 
over the joints and posts of the bedsteads. Repeat the 
application if the first is not successful. Or well wash 
with a strong infusion' of tobacco leaves, steeped in boil- 
ing water. 

To Sweep Carpets- 

Sprinkle tea-leaves over them, and sweep them with 
a hair broom ; a whisk should very seldom be used; and 
^De carpets should be done with a clothes brush. Dry 
snow is preferable to tea-leaves, and should be used in 
the same way. . \ 

To Wash and Clean a Carpet. 

Shake and beat it well ; lay it upon the floor, and tack 
it firmly ; then with a clean flannel wash it over with one 
quart of bullock's gall, mixed with three quarts of soft 
cold water, and rub it off with a clean flannel or house 
cloth. Any particularly dirty spot should be rubbed with 
pure gall. 

To take Stains out of Marble Chimney-Pieces 

and Hearths. 

Mix, with one quart of strong soap-lees, one pound of 
pearl ashes, and as much fine whitening as will make it 
into a paste ; lay this all over the marble, and let it re* 
main for some weeks ; then wash it off with a flannel, and 
cold water and soap. Polish it with a dry flannel. 

Clean Feathers. 

"^ Allow, to every gallon of water, half a pound of quick 
Ume-y stir the mixtuiQ well) and let it stand a night; then 






MISCKLLAITY. 451 

pour off for use the lime water tliat is perfectly clear; put 
the feathers to be cleaned into a deep tnb, and poar as 
much lime water on them as will cover them ; stir them 
well with a stick, and let them stand two or three days, 
stirring them frequently ; then put them into a bag, and 
wash them thoroughly in cold water ; then turn them out 
on sieves, and wring the water (irom them by squeezing 
them in small portions with the hands ; after which, they 
may be separated, the hard quills picked out, and the 
down stripped from the large feath^s. When they are 
thus carefully cleaned, lay them on a floor where air can 
be freely admitted ; turn and shake them frequently, and 
when dry, put them into bi^s, and beat them on a knock- 
ing-stone with a knocker* 

To Wash Silk Stockings, White and Black. 

Cut in thin bits some white soap, and boil it in soft 
water ; pour a little of it amongst cold soft water, and 
wash the stockings, first updn the inner side ; repeat the 
washing with fresh suds and water, till they ai*e washed 
quite clean ; turn the outside the last time of washing, and 
if the feet be very dirty, nib a little of the boiled soap 
upon them, but not upon the legs. If to be coloured, mix: 
the dye with a little clean suds, and dip in the white 
stockings ; draw them out smooth, and lay them upon a 
sheet on a bed, with the window open, and when almost 
dry, lay them upon a {Hece of flannel, and with another 
bit rolled up^ rub them hard and quick one way, till they 
lo<^ glossy and are dry. They may be mangled, turned 
upon the inner side, and must always be folded straight 
upon the instep. 

To Wash Lacp. 

Place the lace in folds, and baste it on each side ; lay 
it in cold water for a night, and wash it in cold water 
with the best white soap ; gently rub and squeeze it; wash 
it in three or four waters T^dth the soap^ and after that 
rinse it well in clean water ; thisn put it into thin starch 
>or rice water ; take out the basting thread, and spread it 



452 MISCELLANY. 

on a blanket upon a bed to dry ; when it is nearly so^ piek 
it oat ; lay it in folds, and when quite dry, lay it in an 
old cambric handkerchief, and then in the folds of a towel ; 
put it upon the rug, or upon a bkinket laid upon a stone, 
and with a heavy wooden pestle, or rolling*pin, beat it 
hard till the lace looks quite smooth. A scarf or veil, 
after being starched, sboidd be pinned out tight upon a 
cloth on the floor, and when dry, beaten in the same maa* 
ner. 

To Wash Head and Clothes Brushes. 

In a pint of hot water, put a dessert-spoonful of pearl- 
ashes, and shake the brush about in it till it be perfectly 
clean ; then pour some clean hot water over it ; shake, 
and dry it before the fire. 

To Wash Flannels and Worsted Thmgs, 

to prevent their Shrinking, and to 

keep them of a good Colour. 

Take half the weight of soda that there is of soap: 
boil them with water, allowing a gallon to ever}' pound 
of soap, and use it when perfectly cold. Wet the flannds 
in cold water, then wash them in fresh cold water, with 
«ome of the boiled mixture amongst it ; wash them in this, 
changing the water till they become perfectly clean ; then 
rinse them well in cold water, and dry them in the shade. 
Worsted stockings, washed in this manner, will be made 
quite clean; but particular care must be taken to wet them 
in clean cold water, previous to washmg them in the cold 
suds. Blankets should be washed in this way also, and 
when nearly dry, frequently shaken to raise the pile, and 
to make them soft. 

All dirty clothes should be laid in cold water the night 
before being washed. 

To Wash Cotton Stockings. 

Lay them in cold water at night ; next day boil them 
in a copper mth %on\« soda and soap ; stir them well 



* 



MISCELLANY. 458 

about, and tbey will become quite clean without any rub-* 
bing ; rinse them well in cold water, and bleach them ; 
when nearly dry, draw them smooth, folding them straight 
over the instep. Place them under a heavy weight, or iron 
them. 

To Wash Coloured Dresses. 

Turn the inner side out, and wash them in cold wa 
ter» in which a little boiled soap is well mixed ; rinse them 
well in clean cold water, and the last time with a little 
salt in the water, and dry them in the shade. They should 
be washed and dried with as much expedition as possible* 

To Clean Gold Chains, Ear-Rings, &c. 

Make a lather of soap and water ; boil the chain in it 
for a few minutes, and immediately on taking it out, lay 
it in magnesia powder which has been heated by the fire ; 
when dry, rub it with flannel ; if embossed, use a brush* 
Or wath a gold chain in soap and water, put it whilst 
wet, into a bag filled with box-wood sawdust ; shake it 
well, and take it out in a little, \dien it will be foimd per- 
fectly clean. The bag must be about eight inches long 
and three broad; and if box-wood sawdust cannot be 
obtained, frcsb clean bran may be substituted. 

To Clean Glasses. 

Glasses should be washed in a wooden vessel, in 
which put a sufficiency of cold water to cover them, and 
rinse them in fresh cold water ; wipe off the wet with one 
cloth, and finish them with another. 

To Clean Decanters. 

Boil up, in small pieces, some coarse brown paper 
or blotting-paper ; wet and soap them, and pat them into 
the decanter, with a little pearl-ashes ; fill in some Inke*^ 
warm water, shake it well for a few minutes^ or, if very 
dirty, let them stand some hours ; then rinse the decan- 
ters with clean cold water. If this does not remove the 
crust of wine which may be at the bottom, use stable lit- 



454 MISCELLANY* 

ter^ with which nearly half fill the decanter, adding some 
cold water, and let it remain fpr several hours ; shake it 
well, and rinse with clean cold water till perfectly cleao. 
The stable litter will also be found an effectual cleanser 
for bottles of any kind, however dirty ; but it will be the 
less required, and much trouble will be spared, if all the 
bottles used throughout the day be rinsed at night with 
cold water before being put away. 

To clean cut crystal, rub it well with a damp spunge, 
dipped in whitening ; then take a dean brush and biiish 
it off; afterwards wash the veaael in cold water. 
. To loosen glass stoppers. — rWben glass stoppers can- 
not easily be taken out, drop on them a little olive oil ; 
place the decanter or bottle before the fire, and in a few 
nunutes they will become loose. 

To Clean Looking-Glasses. 

. Take a bit of soft spunge, well washed, and cleaned 
0rom every thing gritty ; just dip it into water, and squeeze 
it out again, and then dip it into spirits of wine, or any 
other spirits ; rub it over the glass, then dust it over with 
some powder-blue, or whitening, sifted through muslin ; 
rub it lightly and quickly off again, with a soft cloth ; 
then take a clean cloth, and rub it well again, and finish 
by rubbing it with a silk handkerchief* If the frames be 
varnished, great care must be taken not to touch them 
with the spunge, or with auy thing damp. To clean 
the frames, take a little cotton wool, and rub them with 

it 

Pictures should be rubbed lightly with cotton wool, or 
brushed with a feather brush. 

To Clean Hats. 

Wbsk a bat gets wet, wipe it as dry as may be with 
a doth or siUc handkerchief, then brush it with a soft 
brush ; when it gets nearly dry, use a harder brush ; and 
if the fur still sticks, damp it with a spunge dipped in 
beer or vinegar ; tben brush it with a hard brush till i\ 
U dry. 



MISCELLANY. 456 

To Remove Spots of Grease out of Cloth. 

MoiSTSN them with a few drops of concentrated so- 
lution of suhcarhonate of potash ; rub the spots between 
the fingers, and then wash the spot with a ^ttle warm 
water. 

To remove oil-paint, or grease, rub the part with a bit 
of flannel dipped in spirits of wine or turpentine. 

Furniture Oil. 

Mix with one pint of cold-drawn linseed oil, one ounce 
of spirits of white lavender, half an ounce of powder- 
ed gnmarabic, dissolved in a little hot oil. This being 
thoroughly mixed, rub it over the tables with a little 
wool, and rub it off with clean linen cloths. A brush 
must never be used. If the furniture is desired of a very- 
dark colour, add to this mixture three ounces of alkanet 
root, and two ounces of rose pink. 

For giving a Bright and Beautiful Polish ta 

Furniture. ^ 

Mix well with an ox-gall one pint of cold-drawn lioh- 
seed oil, then stir in two glasses oi whisky, and when 
thoroughly mixed, add half an ounce of aquafortis, end 
stir it altogether for ten or fifteen minutes ; bottle it, aad 
when to be used, shake it well ; rub it on with a pie^{f|( 
flannel^ and then rub very hard with a linen cloth. „ 

To Clean Chairs. 

Scrape down one or two ounces of bees-wax, put it 
into a jar, and pour as much spirit of turpentine over it aa 
will cover it ; let it stand till dissolved. Put a little up* 
on a flannel or bit of green baize, mb it |^K>n tlfe chairs, 
and polish them with a brush. A very small portion of 
finely-powdered white rosin may be mixed wiA the tur- 
pentfhe and wax. 



456 MISCELLANY. 

To Clean Plate. 

Cut a yard of coarse calico into four, and boil it in a 
quart of water, together with two ounces of calcined, 
powdered, and sifted hartshorn, till all the liquid be ab- 
sorbed^ The plate being washed clean, rub it with a 
piece of the cloth. 

All plate powder which is mixed with mercury is per- 
nicious. Fine colcothar of vitriol, such as painters use, 
is an excellent plate powder ; that, or whitening, may be 
used, dry, or wet with water, spirits, or oil. The last gives 
the brightest polish, but is. the most troublesome ; it 
should be put upon the plate with a piece of flannel, the 
powder then shaken over it, and rubbed off with a lea- 
ther, or with the hand, if the article is plain ; for the 
rough parts, it will be necessary to have brushes of va- 
rious sizes, hard and soft; a small tooth-brush will be 
found useful amongst them. The spnnge and leather 
used for washing plate should be soft, and a linen cloth 
must be used to wipe the plate before it is put upon the- 
table. 

Plated articles should be cleaned with soft brushes, and 
not too often, and never with any thing but plate powder, 
wet with spirits or water, as above directed. 

To remove wax or grease from plate or candlesticks, 
pour boiling water on them, and wipe them dry directly 
with an old cloth. 

Japanned Candlesticks and Tea-Trays. 

To remove grease from candlesticks, just let the water 
be warm enough to melt it ; then wipe them with a cloth, 
and if they look smeared, sprinkle a little flour upon 
them, and wipe it clean off. Wax candles should not be 
burned ^ them, as the wax cannot be taken off without 
injuring the varnish. 

Wax Candles. 

Should they get dirty or yellow, wet them with a 
piece of flannel dipped in spirits of wine. 



MISCELLANY. 45? 

Shoe-Blacking. 

To four ounces of ivory»black, allow three ounces of 
h)af sugar, one table-spoonful of salad oil^ one ounce of 
oil of vitriol, and one pint of vinegar ; dissolve the. sugar 
in a little vinegar, put it on the fire together with the 
oil, and stir it well ; when moderately heated, add the 
pint of vinegar, and ivory-black ; and, when cold, stir in 
the vitriol ; put it into a quart bottle, shake it well, and 
£11 it up with vinegar. 

Another way to make Shoe-Blacking. 

Mix, in one quart of sour porter, the following ingre« 
dients : — Three ounces of ivory-black, the same quantity 
of treacle, two table-spoonfuls of sweet oil, and, lastly,' 
one ounce of vitriol ; bottle, and shake it welL

moYed ; then spunged well with cold water, and rubbed 
witii flannel till they be highly polished. 

To render Boots and Shoes Water-proof. 

Mix carefully over a slow fire, a pint of drying- oil^ two 
ounces of turpentine, two ounces of yellow wax, and half 
an ounce of Burgundy pitch. Lay the mixture, whilst 
l^ot^ on the boots and shoes with a spunge, soft brush, or 
bit of fianneli and when dry, lay it on again ; repeat the 
operation until the leather becomes quite saturated. Let 
them be put away, and not worn, till they become per-

the leaFeer, and strew over them three quarters of a pound 
of common salt ; let them remain two or tliree days, and 



MISCELLANY. 459 

if any fresh flowers are added, some more salt should he 
sprinkled over them. Mix with the roses half a pound 
of finely-pounded hay-salt, the same quantity of allspice, 
of cloves, and of hrown sugar, a quarter of a pound of 
gum-benjamin, and two ounces of orris-root ; add a glass 
of brandy, and any sort of fragrant flower, such as orange 
and lemon flowers, rosemary, and a great qi^antity of la« 
Tender flowers — ^also white lilies ; a green orange stuck 
with cloves may be added. All the flowers must be ga- 
thered perfectly dry. 

To make Coffee when much is required. 

In the morning, pour upon a quarter of a pound of 
fresh-ground cofiee about two quarts of boiling water ; 
stir it for three or four minutes ; cover it closely, and let 
it remain till the evening; pour it off quite clear, and 
boil it up for use. 

Another way to make Coffee. 

Beat an egg, shell and all ; mix it with a quarter of 
a pound of c^^ee, then pour two quarts of boiling water 
on iiy and boil it for five minutes ; let it settle a little that 
it may be fine ; or, instead of clearing it with an egg, pour 
a little cold water into the coffee-pot before taking it off 
the fire. It may be made in this way in a large quantity, 
the clear part poured off, bottled, and corked. Thus pre- 
pared, kept in a cool place^ it will continue good for ten

White Wine Whey. 

Boil a pint of milk, and when it rises in the pan, pour 
in one glass of sherry *and one of currant wine; let it 
again boil up, take it off the fire, and when it has stood a 
few minutes, remove the curd, pour off the clear whey, 
and sweeten it. 

Irish, or Two Milk Whey. 

One-third of fresh buttermilk is allowed to two- 
thirds of sweet milk ; put the milk into a sauce-pan, make 
it boiling hot, and then pour in the buttermilk, and gently 
. stir it round the edges of the pan ; let it come to a boil, 
take it off the fire, let it settle, and strain off the whey* 

Sour milk may be substituted for buttermilk. An ex- 
cellent drink in fever. 

Toast and Water. 

Pare the crust off a thin slice of stale bread, toast it 
brown upon both sides, doing it equally and slowly, that 
it may harden without being burnt ; put it into a jug, and 
pour upon it boiling water ; cover the jug with a saucer, 
and set in a cool place. 

Arrow-Root Water. 

Boil the peel of half a lemon in a quart of water ; pour 
it over a table-spoonful of arrow-root which has been mix-

sometimes boiled with a third of its quantity of water. 

Gloucester Jelly. 

Boil, in two' quarts of water, till reduced to one quart, 
the following insredients : — Hartshorn shavings, isinglass, 
'ivory shavings, barley, aiid rice, one ounce of each. 

When this jelly, which is light, and very nourishing, is 
to be taken, a few table-spoonfuls of it must be dissolved 
in a little milk, together with a bit of cinnamon, lemon- 
peel, and sugar. It will be very good without the sea- 
soning. 

To make Arrow-Root. 

Mix with two or three table-spoonfuls of arrow-root 
half a pint of cold water ; let it stand for nearly a quarter

glass of rum may be added ; stir it all the time it is boil- 
ing ; in ten minute or. so drop a little upon a buttered 
plate, and if it harden, pour it from the pan over the bot- 
tom of buttered plates ; as soon .as it cools sufBciently to 
be handled safely, pull k out with a machine made for 
the puq>ose, or rub the hands witb butter, and draw it out 
at arm's-length^ then fold it, touching it as lightly as pos- 
sible with the fingers ; and so continue to wcnrk it till it 
hardens, and becomes of a light colour ; it is then pulled 
out as quickly 9^ possible into small sticks, which must 
be cut with a buttered knife on a table or board dusted 
with flour : narrow strips of whity-brown paper should 
be prepared to twist round the sticks as they are cut. 
The- plates should also be buttered before the boiling 
commences, and every thing had in readiness ; as no time 
is to be lost after the treacle is boiled. 

Captain Hall'^ Sandwiches for Travellers. 

Spread butter, very thinly, upon the upper part of a 
stale loaf of bread cut very smooth, and then cut off tbe 
slice ; now cut off another thin slice, but spread it witli 
butter on the under side, without which precaution the 
two slices of bread ^nll not fit one another. Next take 
some cold beef, or ham, and cut it into very minute par- 
ticles. Sprinkle these thickly over the butter, and, having 
added a little mustard, put the slices face to face, and 
press them together. Lastly, cut the whole into four 
equal portions, each of which is to be wrapped in a sepa- 
rate piece of paper.

CHAPTER XX. 
POULTRY. 

MANAGEMENT OF POULTRY, 

Warm, dry, and ehingly soil, like the sea beach, is 
best adapted for the rearing of poultry ; and such may 
be artificially formed, where it is not s^orded by nature. 
A yard or court being pitched upon, the foundation should 
be laid with chalk or bricklayers' rubbish, the surface to 
consist of sandy gravel ; and considerable spots of it may 
be sown with common trefoil or wild clover, with a mix- 
ture of bumet, spurry, or star-grass, which last species 
is particularly salubrious to poultry. The surface must 
be sloped and drained, so as to avoid all stagnant moist- 
ure, and the whole enclosed with a fence, lofty, and so 
secured at the bottom that the smallest chicken may not 
fiud a passage through* 

The poultry houses within the court should have a 
southern aspect, and if the number of the stock be large, 
the houses had far better be small and detached ; and 
should they abut upon a stable, brew-house, or any con- 
ductor of warmth, it will be a ferther advantage. The 
floors should consist of well-rammed chalk or earth, so 
that they may be easily swept dean In the roof, which 
must be lofty, there should be only mve long and level 
range of perches ; and if in the w^ steps be so placed 
that the poultry may jump from the one to the other, the 
ascent will be rendered easy to the perches, and also to 
the nests, for whicji boxes are the most convenient, when 
properly constr«cte4i A few railed doors may be pro- 



468 poultrV. 

vided, to hang before the entrance of those in which hens 
are sitting. Nests for breeders are generally preferred 
upon the ground, on account of the danger of chickens 
fcdling from those which are placed above. In making 
the nest, soft and short straw should be chosen. Various 
beds, or heaps, of sifted ashes or very dry sand, shonld be 
placed in the yard, in which the fowls may have the 
comfort and benefit of rolling and bathing themselves; 
and a place of refuge should be provided for such hens 
or chickens as the cock has taken a dislike to. 

The feeding-room, at once warm, and airy, and large 
enough to accommodate twenty or thirty fowls, should 
have perches in it for those birds that are inclined to 
perch, which they will not be after they have become 
heavy. The floor may be slightly littered down ; the 
litter often changed. The greatest cleanliness should be 
observed, and sandy gravel placed in several layers, and 
often changed. A sufficient number of troughs, for both 
water and food, should be placed around, that the stodc 
may feed with as little interruption as possible from each 
other. This description of feeding room is well adapted 
for the feeding of young chickens ; and it will be found 
most advantageous to put them up immediately on their 
being quitted by the hen, more particularly young cocks, 
and all those which stand high upon the legs. 

Under a regular system, it would be preferable to se- 
parate entirely the aquatic from the other poultry, the 
aquatic to ha^e their houses ranged along the banks of a 
piece of water, with a fence, and sufficiently capacious 
walks in front ; access to the water by doors, to be closed 
at will. 

The White Darking 

Is one of the largest of our fowls, and is a plentiful 
layer ; the polanders are similar, but generally black ; they 
are very ornamental, and one of the most useful varieties 
— they are sometimes called everlasting layers, and being 
Jeast inclined to sit of any other breed, their eggs are 
frequently set wtxdet olVi^i: Vven«% The flesh of the game 



POULTRY. 469 

fowl is superior to all other breeds of domestic fowls for 
richness and delicacy of flavour ; but from their disposi- 
tion to fight, they are difficult to be reared. Yellow-leg- . 
ged fowls are often of a tender constitution, and always 
inferior in the quality of their flesh. A young and healthy 
fowl may be known by the fresh and florid colour of the 
comb, the dryness of the eye, and the nostrils being free 
from any discharge, and the plumage glossy. The indi- 
cations of old age are, paleness of the comb and gills, ful- 
ness of colour, and a sort of downy stiffness in the fea- 
thers, length and size of talons, the scales upon the legs 
becoming large and prominent. Delicate white hens do 
not lay so many eggs in a cold season as the more hardy 
colom'ed varieties. Cordial horse-ball is good to promote 
laying in cold weather, and also toast and ale. 

A hen desirous of sitting should not be prevented by 
any violent means ; allowing her to sit will probably not 
deter her so long from laying as harsh treatment. Those 
above the commcm size of their respective varieties are 
not preferable as layers or sitters. They are in their prime 
at three years, and decline after five. The number of hens 
to one cock from four to six. When a cock is moulting 
it should be withdrawn, and one that is known to and 
familiar with the hens substituted. When a turkey-hen 
becomes sick, it is found beneficial to pull out the feathers 
of the tail. It should be a general rule to breed from 
young stock* A two«years-old cock, and pullets in their 
second year, provided they have the best food, accom- 
modation, and attendance, may be allowed to sit so early 
as January. £^gs for sitting should never exceed the 
age of a month ; the newest laid to be preferred, and as 
nearly of a size as possible ; diose which have the circu- 
lar flaw, indicating the double yolk, should be avoided. 
The number of eggs may be from nine to fifteen, accord- 
ing to the size of the fowl ; an odd number should be 
chosen, that they may lie the closer, and they may be 
mailed with a pen and ink, so that any new-laid ones 
may be removed. An egg being broken in the nest, it 
should be cleared away, and the remainder washed with 



470 POULTRY* 

wann water. It is proper to place com and water occa* 
sionally beside the sitting li«a, withdrawing them as soon 
as she is satisfied. Hens sit twenty days. 

The chickens first hatched should he taken from the 
nest, and secured in a hasket of wool or soft bay, and 
kept, if the weather be cold, near the fire. They will re- 
qoire no food for some hours, even for twenty^fonr. The 
whole brood being hatched, the hen is ta be placed for 
some days ander coop, upon a dry place, and, if possible, 
not within reach of another hen, nor near numbers of 
young fowls. The first food split grits, afterwards tail 
com. All watery food, soaked bread, or potatoes, im- 
proper as first food ; hard-boiled eggs, and curd chopped 
small, is much approved ; their water should be pure, and 
often renewed. There are pans made in such forms, that 
{bt chickens may drink without getting into the water; 
a basin turned down in the middle of a pan of water, wiH 
answer the end, the water running round it. They must 
not be let out early in the mommg, or whilst the dew re- 
mains upon the ground, far less be su£Rered to range over 
the wet grass ; and they should be cautiously guarded 
against sudden changes of the weather, or exposure to 
rain. 

When the hen begins to roost, the chickens may be 
associated with the young poultry as nearly of their 
own age as possible, or put up to feed. In choosing 
full-sized fowls for feeding, the short-legged and early 
hatched always deserve a preference. There are various 
modes of feeding, but whether for domestic use or sale, 
the best method is constant high keep from the begin- 
nmg ; their flesh will in consequence be more juicy and 
£ner flavoured, and they will be always ready for the 
table, except in the moulting season, which is during the 
autumn for the old, and the spring for the young poul- 
try. The pullets which have been hatched in March, if 
high fed from the beginning, will lay plentifully throucrh 
the following autumn, and in February may be used for 
the table ; about which period their laying will be finish* 
ed. The fowls will be finest that have the iiin of the 



POULTRY. 471 

fanD-yard ; but they will be little inferior if accommo- 
dated and attended to as before directed, and allowed 
abundance and variety of wholesome food. Barley is 
the best grain for poultry, bat they will thrive well oft 
oats and tail wheat ; heavy wheat is generally considered 
injmiaus; any light grain ground, together with peas^ 
and made into brose, will be found excellent food ; as 
also potatoes, when boiled, peeled^ and made into thick 
brose with meal, that is, boiling water stirred into the 
mixture. A cock and two hens, having as much food as 
they choose to eat, will consume a quarter of a peck of 
the best barley in a week. 

Turkeys. 

The true black Norfolk turkey is esteemed superior 
to all others. One turkey cock is sufficient for six hens* 
The hen will cover, according to her size, from nine to 
fifteen eggs. Her term of sitting is thirty days, during 
which period constant attendance, with both food and 
water, is nece8,9ary« The chicks must.be withdrawn from 
the nest as soon as hatched, and kept very warm. The 
hen and brood should be housed during a month or six 
weeks, and fed with barley or oatmeal, which may be 
mixed with young nettles chopped, or garden cresses, and 
kneaded with water as dry as possible. Their food should 
be often renewed, as also their drink, which should be 
water only. In case of the chicks mppearing sickly, and 
the feathers ruffled, indicating a chdl from severity or 
change of weather, half-ground malt may be mixed with 
the barleymeal, and by way of medicine^ powdered canu* 
way seeds ; also artificial worms, that is, bcnled meat pull- 
ed into strings, in running .after which the chicks have a 
salutary exercise. This diet is beneficial for every spe- 
cies of chicks. All slop victuals should be avoided ; and 
their being kept dry, warm, and elean^ is of the utmost 
consequence. A fresh turf of short sweet grass daily,- 
cleared from snails and slugs, which will scour young 
chicks, is very pleasing' to th^m, and promotes their 



472 POULTRY.. 

health. After a month or six weeks' confinement within 
doors, the hens may be cooped for another fortnight ; 
when fall grown, they will, in a good range, provide 
themselves .throughout the day, requiring only to be fed 
fit their outletting in the mornii^, and on their return at 
even. Sodden Imrley, or barley and wheat meal mixed, 
ia the proper food for fattening turkeys. The flesh of the 
young cocks, intended for the table, will become more 
dehcate if the fleshy substance which grows immediately 
above the bill be taken o£f when it is about a quarter of 
an inch long ; a worsted thread tied round it will bring it 
off in a few weeks. 

The Bustard 

Will probably thiive well on the same food as the 
turkey. It is seldom reared; but as its flesh has ever 
been considered most delicious, it appears particularly 
worthy of the attention of those who aim at variety and 
novelty. 

Guinea and Pea Fowls 

Are in season when game is going out, namely, from 
February to June. The guinea fowl assimilates per- 
fectly with the common species in habits and in kinds of 
food. They are very prolific, and their eggs nourishing 
and good. The peacock is not only ornamental, but use- 
fal for the destruction of all kinds of reptiles ; but some 
are apt to tear to pieces young chickens and ducklings. 
They are also destructive in gardens. The cock requires 
from two to four hens. They are granivorous, like other 
domestic fowls, prderring barley. 

The Duck. 

The Rhone ducks are of a darker flesh, and more sa* 
Toury^ than the English duck, but somewhat coarse. The 
white variety of the English duck is never so high- fla- 
voured as the darker colours. The Muscovy and other 
foreign varieties are kept uMire for curiosity than use. 



POULTRY. 473 

The white Ayle&lrary are a beautiful stock. The can- 
vass-backed ducks of America are said to be the finest 
in the world ; they have probably not yet been imported 
into Europe. The duck will cover from eleven to fifteen 
eggs, and she sits t|drty days. One drake to five ducks 
is allowed. The duck, when sitting, requires a secret 
and safe place ; but no farther attendance is necessary till 
the whole brood is hatched, when a coop should be pre* 
pared upon the short grass, if the weather is fine, or un- 
der shelter^ if otherwise ; a wide and flat dish of water, 
often to be renewed, standing at hand ; barley, or any 
meal, the first food. In rainy weather particularly, it is 
useful to clip the tails of the ducklings, and the surround- 
ing down beneath, that they may not draggle and weaken 
themselves. The duck should be cooped at a distance 
from any other ; their confinement to the coop need selr 
dom extend to a fortnight. Oats whole or bruised are 
the standard fattening material for ducks and geese, to 
which may be added peasemeal, as it may be required ; 
and if tbey are confined, the house-wash may be mixed 
with their food. They are very fond of acorns, and will 
get fat on them alone. 

The Goose. 

The best geese in England are probably to be found 
on the borders of Suffolk and Norfolk, and m Berkshire. 
The foreign varieties are kept only for ornament. Theiv 
treatment is similar to that of ducks. Some cooling 
greens, clivers, or the like, may be mixed with their first 
food, namely, barleymeal, Innised oats, or fine pollards. 
Hemlock, or deadly nightshade, should be removed from 
the range of young geese ; and both old and young are 
often kDled by swallowing slips of yew after they are 
able to frequent the pond. The young geese will obtain 
their living, and few people favourably situated allow 
them any thing more excepting the vegetable produce of 
the garden ; but to have fine geese, a little solid com or 
pulse may be given morning and evening. Equal quan- 
tities of the meal of rye and pulse, mixed with skimmed- 



474 'POULTRt* 

itii]k, form an excellent feeding article for geese and 
docks* 

Pigeons. 

The proper place for the pigeonJionse, or cot, is the 
poultry-yard ; it sSumld have a south-west aspect. The 
common barred dovecot is well adapted to every situs- 
tion, and pigeons do well near dwellings, stables, bake- 
houses, or such offices. Its situation will necessarily de« 
pend on convenience. One general rule must, however, 
be observed, that every pair of pigeons have two holes 
or rooms to nest in. Cleanliness is one of the first and 
most important considerations. They will thrive the 
better if cleaned daily and thorou^ly once a-week — ^the 
floor covered with sifted gravel often renewed. They 
are exceedingly fend of water, and when confined in a 
room should have a pan of water, often renewed, as a 
bath ; and to take their attention from the garden, and to 
prevent their picking the mortar from buildings, they 
should be provided with a salt cat, which is a dish of the 
follofving composition : — Loam, sand, mortar, fresh lime, 
bay salt, cummin, coriander, caraway seed, and allspicci 
moistened with beer, heaped up in the dish, and a piece 
of board placed upon the summit to prevent the birds 
from dunging upon it. 

It is always injudicious to purchase old pigeons for 
stocking, as even cutting their wings will not insure their 
remaining. Squeakers, or such as have not yet flown, tHO 
become perfectly domesticated if confined for a short time. 
In justice to the farmer, the proprietor of pigeons ought 
to feed them regularly, more particularly in seedtime, 
and towards harvest, and also when the ground is bound 
by frost, or covered with snow. Tares, and the smallest 
kind of horse-bean, commonly called pigeon-beans, are 
both the best and cheapest food, and the pulse is better 
to be of the prerious year.

A proper choice of cows is of the greatest importance. 
Of the black cattle of the island, the short-homed, or 
Dutch, and the long-homed, or Lancashire, are in general 
preferred ; the first yields the greatest quantity of milk ; 
that of the second is not so abmidaat* but richer ; the 
polled, or Galloway cows, are excellent milkers, and the 
Suffolk duns are much esteemed, as are also the Ayrshire 
cows. For the management of cows, it is of the greatest 
consequence to keep them easy, clean, and well aired ; 
when they are turned out to pasture, they must not be 
over driven, or have so far to travel as to induce fatigue. 
Their food in winter may be of two kinds, either dry or 
greeu ; of dry food, hay and straw are almost the only 
kinds used ; the most profitable kinds of green food are 
parsnips, cairots, cabbages, and turnips ; from onex>r two 
hundred pounds a-day of cabbages or turnips will be con- 
aumed by a middle<«ized cow. By means of stall-feeding, 
wiUi green crops, a cow can be kept in milk not only foe 
a month longer in autumn than by the common modes, 
but even through the whole winter season. When green 
succulent food cannot be procured, it will be judicious to 
give them their preserved fodder either boiled, or steeped 
in warm water. It is found to be beneficial to them to vary 
their food from time to time, and for a few weeks before 
calving, they should have every night a little hay, or a 
Bomewhat greater allowance of green food. 

Oh the day of calving, they should be kept in ; and im- 
mediately after, it is useful to give them a handful or two 
of meal, mixed with lukewarm water. For a fortnight after 
calving, they should have, with their green food, a little 
Jbay, or chopped straw, with some ground or crushed oats. 
T)m food ought to be put into their stalls in small quanti- 
ties at a time, and a little salt given with it improves the 
quality, and increases the quantity of milk. The land 
necessary to maintain a cow, may, at an average, be stated 
from two to three English acres, if there be taken into ac- 
count, the com, hay, straw, and every thing else the animal 
consumes. 

One dairy-mald may manage a dozen or fifteen cows,

haying assistance in tbe milking of them. Cows should 
be milked in the house rather than in the field ; three times 
a-day, at least, in summer : early in the morning, at noon, 
and just before nightfalL It is of the utmost consequencse, 
that the whole milk secreted be at each milking drawn 
away. It may be laid down as a pretty general rule, that 
eighteen pounds of milk will yield one pound of butter, 
and that this is the produce of a single cow per day ; some, 
however, will famish twice or even thrice this quantity. 
The best age for a milk cow is betwixt four and ten. 
When old, she will give more milk, but of an inferior 
quality. 

Of the Prevention and Cure of Diseases 
incident to Black Cattle. 

Regular watering, at well as sound food, prevents 
many diseases ; and cattle ought to be carefully kept from 
smelling carrion, or chewing bones. 

The diseases of cattle may be divided into three classes* 
The first proceeds from feeding too greedily on clover or 
common grass, particularly in the fall of the year. The 
remedy usually employed is the probang, a flexible in- 
strument, which being passed into the stomach, the con- 
-fined air rashes out ; when this b not at hand, three small 
canes, each six feet long, are bound together with waxed 
packthread, and a smooth ball of wood, about the size of 
a pigeon's egg^ fixed at the end ; in order to pass it down 
the throat, an assistant must lay hold of the nostrils, and 
keep out the head as nearly as possible in a line with 
the throat. The food that is in consequence thrown up, 
must be removed from the mouth ; after which, the ani- 
mal should be turned out into bare pasture, or get twice 
a- day, for three days, half a pint of mild ale, with one 
race of ginger grated into it. But in the first stage of the 
complaint, a table-spoonful of hartshorn, mixed with a 
pint of train-oil, will generally efiect a cnre. 

The diseases of the second class proceed from derange- 
ment of the digestive system, and occur chiefly late in 
winter or in spring. They are moor-ill, yellows, red- 



47ft 7HB PAIBY. 

water, flatulent colic^ scouring, tail-rot, joint-fallen, &c., 
for which the following opening medicine is administered : 
— Mix, for one drendi, of common salt four ounces, Bar- 
badoes aloes half an ounce, ginger one drachm, water one 
quart, and anodyne carminative tincture two ounces, or a 
glass of gin. 

Having administered in the morning the opening me- 
dicine, for scouring or for tail-rot, the following cordial 
may be ^ven in the evening : — Take of powdwed catechu 
two drachms, fresh powdered allspice two drachms, fresh- 
powdered caraways half an ounce, good strong beer or ale 
half a pint, table-beer or water half a pint ; let the in- 
gredients be simmered for a few minutes in the table- 
beer or water, and let the strong beer be added at the time 
the drench is given. 

The third class depends on repletion of the blood-ves- 
sels, and prevails most in summer ; the symptoms of fever 
are, quick breathing, hot horns and ears, &c. The reme- 
dies to be employed are copious bleeding, that is, till the 
animal becomes fidnt, (a young and healdiy cow will ge- 
nerally bear the loss of two gallons of blood,) opening 
fuedicine, and putting the animal on short or bare pasture. 
The only application necessary for swollen udder, or 
swollen joints, is neat's feet oil, or olive oil ; when the 
swelling is considerable, fomentation, with hot water ha- 
ving a little grease in it, may be of use. The best remedy 
for sore teats is rubbing them with hog*s lard. 

When a cow chokes upon a turnip, pour down its throat 
salt and water ; if that will not do, use a homfal of salt 
and melted grease, such as hog's lard, or any kind of com- 
inon grease ; vrarm oil and salt would probably have the 
same effect. 

When a calf seems indisposed and loose in the bowels, 
% little powdered chalk may be added to its milk ; or boil 
a large taUe-epoonf nl of potato flour in each meal of milk, 
to bring it to the consistence of middling cream. When 
<XMtive, the following laxative may be given ; and when it 
scours, the following cordial will be found effectual :— 



THE DAIRYt 479 

Laxative. 

Of common sah, from half an ounce to one omice, 
aloes one drachm^ soda one drachm, ginger half a drachm^ 
water half a pint, and gin a table-spoonful, well mixed 
together. 

CordiaL 

Caraway seeds, recently powdered, half an ounce, 
ginger half a drachm, carbonate of soda one drachm, water 
eight ounces^ and brandy or gin one ounce, mixed well. 

Calves 

Should be taken from the cow immediately, and wfae- 
ther to be reared or fatted, are best fed entirely cm milk ; 
but if it be scarce, they mfy get milk-porridge, or turnips 
boiled to a mash, and mixed with two pints of milk at 
each mealy which should be given three times a-day the 
£r8t month, twice the second, and once the third. When 
the calf is to be fed for the table, it should have as much 
jailk, warm from the cow, (the last>drawn, to have ex«* 
tremely fine vealy) as it will take three times a-day. When 
it is fire weeks old, it should be bled, and again a wedc 
after ; in a few days more, it may be killed. Some per<P 
sons consider bleeding imnecessary. 

Butter, 

In the production of good butter, more depends cm 
management than on the quality of the cow, or the rich- 
ness of its food. When dairying is conducted on a great 
scale, the horizontal, cimimonly called the barrel-chum, 
is the best ; and on a small scale the patent box-chum 
will be found most eligible ; the vertical, or pump-chom, 
is well adapted to the operation of making butter fix)m 
the produce of a few cows only. Milk is not at the best 
till about four months after the cow has calved ; and the 
degree of heat most fiivourable to the production of cream 
from' milk, is fronji 50° to 55° Fahrenheit. In summer, 
the milk should be allowed to stand half an hour before 



480 THE DAIRY. 

it be pat into the pans, which should not exceed two 
inches in depth. In winter, it should be set as soon as 
possible. From the last-drawn half of the milk, if allow- 
ed to staad till it tastes perceptibly soarisb, cream of a 
superior quality will be obtained, and its quantity not 
considerably less than if the whole were set apart for the 
production of cream. Sweet cream requires four times 
as much churning as ihat which has become sour by 
standing. From twelve to twenty hours in summer, and 
about twice as long in winter, should be permitted to 
elapse before the milk is skimmed— after it is put into 
the pans, during the hot summer months, this should al- 
ways be done in the morning before the dairy becomes 
warm. The cream should wen be deposited in a jar, 
placed in the coolest part of the dairy, stirred often, and 
shifted every morning, into a^leen and well-scalded jar, 
or other yessel. In hot weather, churning should be pa> 
formed, if possible, erery other day, and never less fre- 
quently ihiui twice a-week. The operation ought to be 
moderate, equable, and uninterrupted. In summer, the 
chum ought to be chilled with cold water before the cream 
be put into it ; and during the process of churning, it 
should be immersed in cold water, to the depth of a JFoot 
or so, provided a pump-chum be used ; to a barrel-chum, 
wet cloths may be applied. In winter, heat must be 
cautiously employed. It is better to steep the chum for 
some time in warm wat^r, than to pour water into it be- 
fore churning ; it may be placed in the warmest part of 
the house, but not close to the fire. 

The cows should not be fed with tumips till after they 
are milked, otherwise tlie milk and butter will have an 
unpleasant taste ; late in the season, when the tumips 
are not so good, this precaution may be insulBlicient. To 
counteract the effects of the turnip, or any other green 
food, boil two ounces of saltpetre, or the same quantity 
of cream of tartar, in a quart of water ; and, when cold, 
add a table-spoonful, or more, if necessary, of the liquid^ 
every other day to the collected cream. 



THE DAIRY. 481 

Method of MakiDg up Butter. 

When the butter is sufficiently gathered in the chum, 
which is known by the largeness of the lumps and the 
cleanness of the dashers, it is taken out, kneaded in a 
bowl, or other shallow vessel, to let out the buttermilk, 
spread thin over the inside of the bowl, and clean cold 
water poured over it ; kneaded, broken, and respnead in 
the water ; the water poured off ; the butter beaten in 
large lumps, or handfuls, of three or four pounds, against 
the sides of the bowl, respread, salted, the salt worked in^ 
rewashed, and rebeaten until the water comes off unsul* 
lied, which it will do after two or three washings. It is 
then broken into pound jumps, rebeaten against the bowl^ 
and printed, or otherwise made uP* 

There is a finishing operation wiiich is sometimes given 
in the neighbourhood of London. It is thus performed :«- 
The bowl or tray being wetted, to prevent the butter from 
sticking to it, and a cheese-cloth, strainer^ or other cloth 
being washed in clean cold water, and wrung as dry as 
possible, a pound lump of butter is placed in the bowl, and 
with a stroke of the hand, proportioned to the stiffness of 
the butter, is beaten with the cloth ; as the pat of butter 
becomes fiat and thin, it is rolled up with the cloth, by a 
kind of dexterity which can only be acquired by prac- 
tice, and again beaten fiat ; the dairy- woman, every three 
or four strokes, rolling up either one side or the other of 
the pat, and moving it about in the bowl, to prevent its 
sticking. As soon as the cloth fills with moisture, which 
it extracts from the butter, and imbibes in the manner of 
a spunge, it is wrung, and rewashed in clean cold water. 
Each pound of butter requires, in cool weather, four or 
five minutes to be beaten thoroughly, but two minutes are 
at any time of essential service. Before the dairy- woman 
begins to take the butter out of the chum, she first scalds, 
and then plunges immediately into cold water, evepy ves- 
sel and thing which she is about to make use of, in order 
to prevent the butter from sticking to them. In summer, 

2h 



482' TH£ DAIRY. 

when the butter is very soft, it is sometimes necessary to 
nib them, after scalding, with salt, which greatly assists 
the wood in retaining the moisture. She also puts her 
own hands into the hottest water she can bear them in, 
rubs them with salt, and immediately plunges them into 
cold water. This she repeats as often as she finds the 
batter stick to them« 

The practice of washing butter in cold water is so ge- 
neral, ^t it seems necessary to describe it ; but those 
who can divest themselves of prejudice, will find, on trig], 
that the butter may be made better, and perfectly free 
from milk, by beating and kneading, without pouring any 
water on it. When formed into pats, it may be put into 
a dish^ and that floated in water .till required; or it may 
be salted in the usual i|[ianner« 

The best season for curing butter is from the beginning 
^ August until the end of September ; but if the pasture 
be rank, whether through soil, manure, or herbage, it is 
generally injudicious to put down butter from it« 

Care must be taken that the firkin be well seasoned 
before butter be put into it. The readiest qaethod is by 
the use of imslaked lime, or a large quantity of salt-and- 
water well boiled, with which it should be scrubbed, and 
afterwards thrown into cold water, to remain three or four 
days, till wanted ; and before receivmg the butter, scrub- 
bed and rubbed with salt. 

To Put down Butter. 

After being worked up with salt, in the proportion 
•f half an ounce to the pound and half of butter, and ha- 
ving lain in pound lumps twenty-four hours, the dairy- 
woman takes two or three of the lumps, joins them to- 
gether, and kneads them in the manner in which paste » 
kneaded. This brings out a considerable quantity of wa- 
tery brine, which being poured out of the bowl, the butter 
is beaten with a cloth as before. The jar having been pre- 
viously boiled, or otherwise thoroughly cleaned, and ha- 
ving stood to be perfectly cool and dry, the butter is 



TH£ DAIRT. 4>83 

thrown into it^ and kneaded down, as firm and close as 
p6s8ib1e, with the knuckles and the cloth alternately ; be- 
ing careiiil not to have any hollow cell or vacuity for the 
air to lodge in, more particularly round the outsides, be- 
tween the butter and the jar ; for this purpose, she repeat- 
edly draws her finger round the sides of the jar, pressing 
the butter hard, and thereby uniting intimately the jar 
and the butter. It is fortunate when the jar can be filled 
at one churning ; but when this cannot be done conveni- 
ently, the top is left level, and when the next churning of 
butter is to be added, the surface is raised into inequaU 
ities, and the two chumings mixed into one mass. The 
jar being filled to within two or three inches of the top, 
it is filled up with brine, made by boiling salt and water, 
in the proportion of a handful to a pint, ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour, straining it into a cooling vessel, and 
when perfectly cold, putting it upon the butter, about one 
and a half or two inches deep. If a wooden bung be put 
upon this, a bladder laid over it, and the jar kept in a dry 
place, the butter thus preserved will remain perfectly 
sweet for almost any length of tone* The jar should be 
wider at the bottom than at the top, resembling the up- 
right chum, the top of it being sufficiently wide to admit* 
of its being filled conveniently^ but not wider. 

Another method of Preparing Battel*. 

Mix one part of saltpetre, one of common salt, and 
two of sugar. This, thoroughly wrought into the butter, 
will keep it for a very long time, and communicates to it 
no salt nor disagreeable taste. 

Scotch method of Salting Butter. 

Wash the butter thoroughly in cold water, pressing it 
strongly and frequently with the hands or broad pieces 
of wood, and changing the water till it comes off clear ; 
then spread it out in thin layers, sprinkle it with salt, in 
the proportion of one ounce to every three pounds of but- 
ter, and work it well. In this manner each churning ia 
prepared, till the quantity required to fill the kit is obtain- 



484 THE DAIRY. 

ed. Make a pickle of salt* and- water strong enough t& 
bear an egg, and boil it with two ounces of loaf sugar. 
Take each making separately, press all the watery brine 
from it, and work it in a little of the prepared pickle ; if 
it should not come o£f clear, repeat the washing in fresh 
pickle. The kit having been well scoured, rubbed widi 
dry salt, and rinsed out with a little of the pickle, pack 
into it separately each making of butter to within tw» 
inches of the top ; put some pickle on it, and a clean linen 
rag ; the head of the vessel is then put on, -and should 
always be kept close upon it. 

Method of Preserving Butter with Honey. 

Th£ butter being cleaned from the milk, it is put into 
jars, and melted on a stove* or in a water bath on the fire; 
just before it boils, it is put in a cool place to settle, and 
must never be stirred. When a little stiiBT, the froth is taken 
off the top, and the dregs removed, it is then worked up 
with honey, in the proportion of an ounce to each pound of 
butter. Preserved in this way, and potted, it will keep 
as long as salted butter ; will be found more suitable for 
the table when to be eaten with sweetmeats, and, in many 
respects, better adapted for kitchen use. 

To make Salt Butter Fresh. 

Put four pounds of salt butter into a chum with four 
quarts of new milk, and a little arnatto ; chum them to- 
gether, and in about an hour take out the butter, and treat 
it exactly as fresh butter, washing it in water, and adding 
the customary quantity of salt. 

Cheese. 

In cheese-making, it is of the utmost consequence to 
have good rennet, which may be obtained from the sto- 
machs of calves, hares, or poultry; that from the maw 
or stomach of calves is most commonly used, and the fol- 
lowing Scotch method of preparing it seems to be the sim- 
plest and best : — When the stomach or bags, usually term- 
ed the yiming, in dairy language, is taken from the calf » 



THE DAIRY. 485 

body, straw, or any other imparity found in it, ought to be 
remoTed from the curdled milk, which,' with the chyle, must 
be carefully preserved ; a handful of salt is put inside; it is 
then rolled up, and put into a basin or jar, and a handful 
of salt strewed over it ; after standing closely covered for 
eight or ten days, it is taken out and tied up in a piece of 
white paper, and hung up near a fire to dry, like bacon, and 
will be the better for hanging a year before it is infused* 
When rennet is wanted, the bag with its contents is cut 
small, and put into ajar or can, with a handful or two of 
salt ; new whey, or boiled water, cooled to 65^, is put 
upon it. If the stomach is from a newly-dropped calf, 
about three pints of liquor may be employed. If the calf 
has been fed for four or ^ye weeks, which will yield 
more rennet than that of one twice that age, eight pints 
or more of liquid may be put to the bag in mash. After 
the infusion has remained in the jar from one to three 
days, the liquid is drawn o£F, and about a pint more of 
whey or water put on the bag ; when it has stood a day 
or two, it is also drawn off, strained with the first liquid, 
and bottled for use as rennet. Some people put a dram- 
glassful of whisky to each quart or choppin of the rennet. 
Thus prepared, it may be used immediately, or kept fw 
months. One table- spoonful of it will coagulate, in ten 
or fifteen minutes, thirty gallons, or sixty Scotch pints, of 
milk^ which will yield more than 24 lbs. avoirdupois of 
cheese. In England^ the curdled milk is generally wash- 
ed from the stomach, and in consequence, the rennet is 
so much weaker than that made in Scotland, that double 
the quantity is used, and it requires from one to some- 
times three hours to form the milk into cm*d. The milk 
ought to be set, that is, the rennet put to it, at 85^ or 90^ 
of Fahrenheit, when the heat of the air is at 70^ ; but as 
the season gets colder, the heat of the milk should be in- 
creased, and covered till it coagulates. 

Cheese-racks save labour in turning. The plate-rack, 
with four or five tier, one above another, seems to be the 
best form. If the cheeses be of different sizes, it ought to 
be much narrower at the. top than at the bottom ; and to

A One-Meal Cheese. 

Whek the milk has been bnragfat in wann from tk 
cow, it is pat into the cheese-tnb, and the rennet added 
to it; the quantity must depend on its strength. Ai 
soon as coagulation has taken place, the cord ia brokci 
and gathered. A cheese-knife is eraplo3^ed to cm tki 
cnrd in Tarions directions ; and this being allowed to 8ib> 
side for a short time, is again cut by the knife more firedj 
than before, and the operation continued till the whsk 
be reduced to small uniform particles. This bosineai 
may occupy about the space of twenty minutes, after 
-whkh the cheese-tub is again co^'ered with a cloth, aid 
allowed to remain neariy the same length of tinse. A^lwi 
the particles have subaded, the whey is laded o% the 
card properly pressed by the bottom of the ekimmiai:^ 
dish, the hands, or a semicircular board and weight adajK* 
ed to the size of the tub. The cheese-knife is now e» 
.ployed, as before, to cut the curd, thereby promoting the 
free separation of the whey ; and pressure is again Wf- 
plied till it be all drained off. The curd is then put into 
two or three separate ressels, and the dairy-womti 
breaks it with Imt hands as small as possible. Duriiu: 
this part of the process salt is scattered over the cnrd 
and intimately mixed with it : the proportion is geueraUy 
regulated by taste — a handful of salt for every six galloD» 
of milk, or about half an ounce to the pound, may be al- 
lowed. 

Having made choice of a ^nt, commonly made of elm* 
with holes in the lower part of it, proportioned to the 
quantity of curd, a cloth is spread over it, and tlie card 
is put in by little and little, breaking it all the while ; sihI 
having filled the xku heaped up, and rounded above its 
top, the cloth is folded over it, a board of an inch thick 
is laid on the vat, and the whole put into the press, the 
power of which ou^ht to be applied gradually, beginning

with about half a hundred- weight. When it has been an 
hour or two in the prees, it is taken out^ the cheese placed 
in a ressei of hot whey or water, to stand for an hour or 
two, to harden the skin. It is then wiped dry, covered 
with a clean dry cloth ; again placed in the vat, which » 
also wiped dry, and put under the press, to remain for 
SIX or eight hours. At this period of the process, if any 
of the edges happen to project, they are pared off, and the 
cheese is pricked all over with a small bodkin an inch or 
two deep. It is then wrapped in a clean dry cloth, and 
replaced in the vat, twice a-day, at least during two dajrs, 
when it is finally removed, and put into the cheese-rack, 
or on a dry board, and turned every day for about a Week. 
A small quantity of dry moss may be put under it. 

When two meals of milk are used, unless the weather 
be very hot, a portion of the creamed milk of the first 
meal, as a half, or third, being placed in a brass pan, over 
a furnace, or in a vessel of hot water, is made scalding 
hot. Half of it is then poured into the pan in which the 
cream of this milk had been placed. The hot milk and 
cream, being now intimately mixed^ are poured into the 
cheese-tub, and the warm milk added that had just come 
in from the cow. 

In making cheeses of the inferior kind, as from skim* 
med milk, wher^, from its tendency to acidity, there is a 
risk that it will break, or curdle, Ti^ile over the fire, ^be 
whole is brought to a proper temperature by the addition 
of hot water. 

The cooler the milk, the more tender and delicate the 
curd becomes ; on the contrary, if the milk be too hot, 
the curd proves tough and hard. The principal thing in 
skim- milk cheese operations is cleanliness, whieb is indeed 
the life and soul of dairy management. Wodden vessels 
in which milk has soured, ought to be washed with water 
into which some potash or- lime has been thrown, then 
filled with water, which should be changed every hour 
in the course of a day or so, and afterwards scalded and 
well dried, before milk be again put into them.

goodness of the cheese, hut is perfectly harmless. An 
ounce of it is sufficient to colour a hundred-weight of 
cheese. When it is to be used, tie up as much of the 
substance as is required, in a linen bag, and put it into 
half a pint of warm water, to stand over night. The whole 
'of this infusion is in the morning mixed with the milk m 
the cheese-tub, and the rag dipped in the milk rubbed on 
the palm of the hand, as long as any of the colouring mat* 
ter can be made to come away.

As soon as the cheese has become firm enough to be

frequently dipped in whey, and when nearly dry, rubbed 
over with a cloth on which fresh butter bad been spread;

has acquired a rich golden polish, and the blue coat be-

when it is at 90° Fahrenheit, add the rennet, when it has 
coagulated, break the curd a little ; put a thin cloth over 
it, and take the whey off through it ; when as much has 
been taken off as will come easily, put the curd into a bag 
or net, and let it hang till it give over dripping, then cut 
the curd in pieces, and lay it in as much cold water as 
will cover it ; let it lie an hour, and as the pieces are 
taken out, strew a little salt upon them, and put then 
into the vat, first breaking the top a little, to make it join 
with the next piece ; then lay a small weight upon it, so 
as not to occasion the wliey to come off white. It most

turned in the vat, and keeping it under a moderate pres- 
sure ; it is then taken out of the vat, swathed tight till it 
J^egin to dry the handage, which must be changed eVery 
twenty-four hours ; it ought to be rubbed with a little salt 
before it is bandaged, and, for a considerable time, wiped 
and turned every day. The best season for making this 
cheese is from July to October. 

Another way to make Stilton Cheese. 

The rennet being added to £ft6en gallons of milk, it 
is allowed to stand an hour, when the whey is taken off 
dlowly, breaking the curd as little as possible ; this ope- 
ration will occupy about the space of an hour and a half; 
cold water is then poured over the curd, so as to cover it, 
and when it has stood twenty minutes, the water is drain- 
ed off, and the curd is broken, and salt added ; a pound 
of newly-churned butter, or a quart of fresh cream, is then 
rubbed thoroughly into it, and it is put into the vat^ and 
placed under a pressure of about twenty-two ounces ; the 
cloth is changed every six or seven hours for some days^ 
and in five or six days, it may be taken out of the vat. 

Auchtertyre Stilton Cheese. 

To fifteen gallons of mid-day milk, add the cream taken 
from the same quantity of morning milk, put to it the 
rennet, and when it has coagulated, break the curd very 
much, and let it stand a little, that the whey may rise to 
the top ; take it completely off, and work into it from 
six ounces to half a pound of salt, according to its strength. 
Place the vat or hoop (which should be long and nar- 
row, made open at both ends, and without holes in the 
sides — ^thirteen inches by twelve is a good proportion for 
this quantity of milk) in a wooden milk cooler, pack the 
curd into it without any cloth under it, and then put on 
the top a round board made to fit closely into the vat ; 
place a weight of four or five pounds upon it, and next 
evening shake the cheese carefully from the vat ; bind 
a cloth round it, and change it for a dry one every day^ 
till the cheese become firm and dry in the skin. 



490 THE DAIRY. 

Bath Cream Cheese. 

Three gallons of new milk, one of hot water, and one 
pint of cream, are mixed together, and a larger proportion 
of rennet added than for milk alone ; when the cnrd is 
come, it is hroken a little, and the whey dripped from 
it ; a gallon of cold water is then ponred over it, and it 
is again hroken and dripped : the same process being re- 
peated a third time, the curd is pnt into two quarts of 
boiling water, and the most of the whey squeezed out ; 
H is liien drained, pnt into the vat, and pressed for three 
hours ; turned, and pressed for three hours more, which 
b sufficient. No salt nor colouring is necessary. 

A Day Cheese. 

One pint of cream being mixed with twelve pints of 
noon-day milk, warm from the cow, a little rennet is 
added, and when the curd is come, the whey is pressed 
out gently, so as to break the curd as little as possiUe ; 
il is then laid in a doth, and put into a small sieve ; the 
cloth is changed every hour during the day, and in twenty- 
four hours it will be fit for use. 

It may be served on a breakfast plate, with vine leaves 
under it, and will keep perfectly good only one day 

New Cheese. 

To six quarts of new milk from the cow, a little hot 
water, and rennet to turn it, are added ; when the curd is 
come, it is cut twice across with a cheese-knife or spoon ; 
then put into a cheese-cloth, and hung up ; in half an hour 
it is again divided with the cheese-knife, hung up, and al- 
lowed to remain till night, when it is put into the press ; 
the following day it is taken out, and each side well nib- 
bed with a little salt. It will be fit for use in two davs.

PREPARATORY REMARKS. 

The atensiU nmst be large in proportkm to the extent 
of the brewing to be carried on ; in most families that point 
ie determined by the size of the washing copper. For two 
kinds of beer^ namely, nine gallona of one sort, (ale,) aad 
nine gallons of another sort, (table beer,) the capacity if 
the copper should not be less than thirteen gallons. The 
size of the tnb most be adapted to the mode of brewing 
to be pursued. If it is proposed to maah only twioes, ils 
capacity should be eighteen gallons; it ought to be nar- 
rower at top than at bottom. Two-third parts of any 
broad-bottomed cask will do very well for carrying on 
the operations of mashing in the small way* A metal 
cock is preferable to a wooden« 

For coolers, common wasbtng-tnbe will 4p tolerably 
well. For each firkin (nine gallons) of liquor to be brew« 
ed, (containing ale and beer together,) let these tubs 
contain on the whole fonrteen gallons; if the number 
can be conreniently increased, it will expedite the cool- 
ing process. For a brewing of eighteen gallons, whether 
of the same or different liquors, one sixteen and one

twelve gallim tab are required, the larger tab being in* 
^ tflided to senre in the threefold capacity of receiyer, 
cooler, and gyle-ton. The tab intended to senre as an- 
derback^ or receiver of the nxnning wort from the mash* 
tab, oaght to have its capacity divided into gallons ; it 
may be done by notches cat in the sarface, or small nails 
driven into the wood. A few paik shonld also be ready 
at hand. A gyle>tan oaght properly to be narrow in 
proportion to its depth; bat a cask of any shape, simply 
deprived of its head, allowing fifteen gallons capacity for 
every nine gallons of liqaor intended to be saffered to 
ferment in it, will do very welL A common thermo- 
meter, with a metal scale, enclosed in a tin case, sboald 
be provided to ascertain the temperatare of the water; 
bat if th^e should not be one at hand, heat 220 mea- 
* awes, gallons or quarts, of water, according to the quai- 
lity required, and, o^en it boils, add 100 similar mea- 
sures of cold water. 

Barrels of eighteen gallons capacity are moat conve- 
nient and economical for strong beer. 

Cleanliness cannot be too much attended to in the 
brewing process. Some days before brewing, all the casks 
and tubs should be filled with water, to render them 
tight ; and, alter the brewing utensils are made use of, 
they should be thoroughly washed out ; during the sum- 
mer, the vessels may be scoured with lime water ; and 
the copper ought to be kept especially dean. The mo- 
ment a cask is empty, fasten down the vent peg, and stop 
the tap-hole with a cork well fitted and hammered into 
its olace. 



BREWING. 493 

Pale-coloured malt is preferable to amber-coloured 
malt ; if it be new, it should be left exposed to the opeft 
air one or two days after grinding, before it be used ; if 
old, it should be ground the one day and used the next. 
When it is ground too finely, it clogs the mash, and im- 
pedes the draining of the wort ; but every grain should 
be bruised. When economy is an object, a quantity of 
molasses or muscovado sugar may be substituted for a 
portion of the malt; 12 lbs. of molasses, or 10 lbs. of 
sugar, are equal to one bushel of malt ; when used, it 
may be dissolved in the water employed for the second 
and third mashing. Famham hops are esteemed the 
best; Nottinghamshire^ termed Northclay hops, have a 
rank flavour in beer newly brewed, and should therefore 
only be used for strong keeping beers. Worcester hops 
have a flavour peculiarly mild and delicate. 

Yeast produced from the fermentation of strong ale or 
porter is the best. 

Quantity of ale or table-beer to be brewed from a 
given quantity of malt and hops :— # 

From a quarter of malt may be brewed 72 gallons of 
ale, or 144 of table-beer ; or 27 of ale, and 90 of table- 
beer. In mashing, the quantity of water employed must 
exceed the beer required in the proportion of six gallons 
to every bushel ; three will be left in the goods, and the 
other three evaporated in the boiling, cooling, and work- 
ing. The wort may be all mixed together in the gyle- 
tun ; or, if strong ale be required, the first and second 
may be fermented separately from the third, which will 
be small beer. If the strong ale be desired particularly 
fine, the second and third may be fermented together, or 
each mashing may ba kept separate ; the first for strong 
ale, the second for keeping beer, and the third small beer 
for immediate use. 

If the beer be not intended for keeping, one bushel of 
malt and ten ounces of hops will produce 12 gallons of 
common or table-ale ; and sJe brewers allow one measure 
of such ale to be equal to two of small beer. From one 
bushel of malt, therefore^ may be brewed 24 gallona q€ 



494 BREWING^ 

table-beer, without any table-ale ; or nine gallons of ale, and 
six of table-beer ; or six of ale, and twelre of table-beer. 
This is the smallest quantity of malt that should be em- 
ployed for brewing twelve gallons of table-ale. If the 
ale be intended for keepings it is advisable to allow six 
bushels (a boll) of pale raalt to brew a hogshead (54 
gallons) of good ale. The quantity of hops must be 
suited to the taste of the consumers ; for those who do 
not like the strong flavour of the hop, two poirnds in 
winter and' three in summer may be allowed to the boll. 

The mashing is done by two^ three, and sometimes 
icfnr infusions of hot water. The degree of heat depends 
on the combination of so many circumstancee, that it 
cannot ]fe fixed by any certain rule. When too hot, it 
forms the malt into a pulp or paste, so that it will wft 
run out of the mash-tun, and the liquor will neither pro- 
duce wort of good quality, nor in any considerable quan- 
tity. This is more particularly the case when the mah 
it low ground, that is, fine. When the water is of too 
^ow a heat, the beer will be spiritless, and liable to tuni 
sour. A large quantity is mashed at a lower heat than 
a small ; and when beer is intended for keeping, the water 
should be of a higher temperature. Well-made malt may 
be mashed at the highest heat ; the extremes may be sta- 
ted at 146*> and 190® of Fahrenheit. 

The first mash stands longer, and is taken at a lower 
heat, than the second^ which again bears the same rela- 
tion to the third. If the goods be glutinous, a longer 
time will be required for spending the tap, as the draw- 
ing ofif the wort is called. After it is drawn off, it should 
be boiled as soon as possible. 

When the process of mashing commences, pour into 
the mash-tun four gallons of boiling water for every peck 
of malt to be employed ; if the copper is not sufficiently 
capacious, boil the remaining quantity of water as quickly 
as possible, and add it to the mash. When the water 
has cooled down to the temperature of, say 170°, let one 
person gradually pour the malt into the tun, while an- 
other stirs and xme^ ^^» "^^^ "^^-^ ^he water, which will 



BREWING. 495 

occupy half an hour at least ; then cover up the tun with 
blankets^ carpets, or whatever else is ready at hand. The 
usual mode of covering with a cap of grist is a waste of 
malt. When the mash has stood one hour and a haK 
in winter, and one hour in summer, let the wort run 
off into the vessel destined to receive it, returning the 
first gallon, which may be thick, to the mash. While 
this mash is preparing, let the copper be again filled with 
water for the second mash, for which two gallons of 
water may be employed for every peck. Let it be pour* 
ed on the malt by one person, while another plies the oar 
for half an hour ; after it has stood an hour, draw it off; 
if it be intended to brew only one kind of liquor, the 
second wort may run into the receiver containing th^ 
first wort. The third mash should be made with the re- 
maining quantity of water, and may stand three quarters 
of an hour. The grist may be mashed in two operations ; 
but it is always preferable to make three mashes. 

To boil the worU — Put along with the first ale wort 
(supposing it to have been kept separate for the purpose 
of brewing ale) the whole quantity of hops into the cop- 
per, boil the mixture till the liquor breaks, or becomes 
clouded with large fleecy flakes. This wiU take place 
probably when the wort has been boiled about an hour 
and a half : the breaking or curdling is best observed by 
taking a basinful of the wort out of the copper, and suf- 
fering it to cool, when the flakes will be distinctly, seen 
in the wort. The tubs having been raised on a support 
from the floor, and arranged for the cooling process, strain 
the boiled liquor into them through a riddle or flour 
sieve ; put the hops back into the copper, and boil them 
again with the second and thu'd wort. The cooling of 
the boiled wort shotdd be effected with the utmost ex- 
pedition ; in summer it should not, if possible, be laid at 
a greater depth than three inches ; in winter Gve ; and 
the coolers so disposed that the temperature of the whole 
may be the same. When it has become milk-warm, or 
from 62° to 65° Fahrenheit, strain it through a sieve 
which has a cloth laid over it, pour the whole into the 



496 BREWING. 

gyle-tuD, (for which the mash>tua may be ased, after 
being cleared out and rinsed with water,) add the yeast, 
and, having covered up the vessel, let it stand in a mo- 
derately warm place. When the heat of the atmosphere 
is more than 60^, the cool of the night mnst be chosen 
to put the beer to work. In lower degrees of the atmo- 
sphere, the wort mast be set at a greater heat than that 
of the air ; when the air is at 50^, the beer may be set 
to work at 50°. It should rather be set at too low than 
too high a temperature. A greater proportion of yeast 
is required in winter than in summer ; and beer intended 
to be kept ten or twelve months will not require so 
nuch as that which is to be used immediately. The ex- 
tract of one quarter of malt will require, if for keeping, 
six pints when the atmosphere is at 40°, five at 60°, and 
three at 80° ; but, for those who are not disposed to 
study all these particulars, the proportion is one quart of 
good stiff yeast to about forty gallons of good strong 
beer or ale wort, and one pint and a half to the same 
quantity of small beer wort. 

As soon as the yeast is added to the wort, the mixture 
should be stirred for two or three minutes ; it is a good 
practice to set the yeast to ferment before it is wanted, 
by diluting it with a portion of lukewarm wort, adding 
more wort as the fermentation proceeds. 

If the fermentation in the gyle-tun be languid and fee- 
ble, one or two large stone bottles, filled with hot water, 
closely corked, may be let down into the tub. The fer- 
mentation in the gyle-tun is completed when the head 
of yeast begins to decline in the middle ; or, observe 
when the head of yeast has well risen, skim it off, and 
repeat the skimming till no more can be separated. The 
fermentation of a small quantity of beer is usually com- 
pleted in two days ; after the collected yeast has stood 
a day, the beer that has separated from it may be return- 
ed to the skimmed liquor. When the fermentation has 
"been apparently completed, draw off the fermented li- 
quor from the thick sediment in the fermenting vessel 
into clean casks, "ptevVouslY rltiaed with boiling water, 



BREWING. 497 

place them with the bung-holes inclined a little to one 
side. A slow fermentation will go on, and the same li- 
quor which overflows from the casks may again (having^ 
been received in a vessel placed underneath the casks for 
that purpose) be used for filling up the barrels, along" 
with any kind of beer that is ready at hand ; it is of great 
consequence to keep the casks constantly filled. The fer- 
mentation ceases spontaneously in & few days, (more or 
less, in proportion to the heat of the atmosphere,) when 
the casks must be bunged up. If the brewing has been 
properly conducted, the beer will be clear in fourteen 
days at farthest ; if it be intended to mantle in the glass, 
it must be bottled o£P before the insensible fermentation 
in the cask has ceased, or, at all events, immediately when 
it has become bright. In warm weather particularly, the 
casks should be occasionally examined ; if a hissing noise 
is audible at the bung-hole, the spile may be left in 
loosely till the liquor has become quiet ; or, which is bet- 
ter, check the fermentation by repeatedly mopping the 
cask all over with cold water. The beer being well pre^ 
pared, remove it to the place where it is to remain Sdc 
Use ; when placed in the cellar, the bung must be drawn, 
^nd the casks filled up quite full with fine beer, skimming 
off the head from time to time. After being attended 
In this manner for a day or two, the casks should be 
bunged tight, and a hole bored with a gimlet near the 
bong for the vent peg, which should -be left rather slack 
For a day or two. If it be absolutely necessary to fine the 
beer by artificial means, it may be done by dissolving a 
dmall quantity of isinglass in stale sour beer. Beer, when 
Dnce in a fit state for use^ should not be again agitated. 
It is only requisite that the cask should be tapped at such 
^ distance from the bottom as to allow the beer, particu- 
larly if it be strong beer, to flow clear of that sediment 
irhich may have collected at the lower part of the vessel. 
Strong beer requires to be six weeks in the cask if the 
quantity be small ; half a hogshead, three or four months, 
before it be bottled ; keeping beer about a fortnight, and 
small beer m week.

498 BREWING. 

The best seasons for brewing are October and ManL 
Ale and porter should be perfectly transparent before 
tbey are bottled. Let the bottles be dry, and leave them, 
when filled, open for six or eight hours ; then cork them 
perfectly aii^tight, with good sound corks. The bottks 
should be strait-necked, smooth, and eren in the montlv 
narrowmg a very little about the neck where the middk 
of the cork comes ; one inch and a half of empty spice 
should be left between the liquor and the lower snrfiMe 
of the cork in the bottle. 

Mangel-Wurzel Beer. 

For a ten-gallon cask, boil in fourteen gallons of wa- 
ter sixty pounds of mangel-wurzel, which has been weU 
washed and sliced across, putting some kind of weigb 
on the roots to keep them under water ; having b<uled n 
hour and a half, they may be taken out, well broken, ani 
all the liquor pressed from the roots ; put it, and tfan in 
which they were boiled, on again to boil, with fonr oonctf 
of hops; let them boil about an hour and n half, tkft 
cool the liquor, as quickly as possible, to 70^ Fahrenheit; 
strain it through a thick cloth laid over a sieve or drain- 
er; put it into the vat with about six ounces of good 
yeast, stir it well, cover it, and let it stand twenty-fo« 
hours ; if the yeast has then well risen, skim it off, and 
barrel the beer, keeping back the thick sediment. While 
the fermentation goes on in the cask^ it may be filled vf 
with the beer left over, or any other kind at hand ; whei 
the fermentation ceases, which may be in two or three 
days, the cask must be bunged up, and in a few dayi 
more, the beer may be used from the cask, or bottled. 

These small proportions are here given to suit the con- 
venience of the humblest labourer ; but the beer will b^ 
better made in larger quantities ; and its strength may be 
increased by adding a greater proportion of mangel- woml '

fifteen gallons of water for an hour and a quarter, add tbe 
bran, and boil twenty minutes longer ; strain the liquor 
on the treacle ; stir the mixture well, and let it stand till 
it becomes milk- warm, or from 60° to 70° Fahrenheit ; 
then strain it through a thick cloth laid oyer a riddle or 
sieve, add four or five ounces of yeast, stir it well, and 
when cold, put it into the cask ; keep filling up the cask 
till it has done working, which may be in two days. It 
must then be bunged up, and will be fit for drinking in 
two days. Tt will keep good in the cask for ten days or a 
fortnight — or it may be bottled. 

This beer will not be so strong nor so cheap as the 
mangel-wurzel beer ; but being scarcely more than one 
halfpenny per bottle, and as good as the b'rewer's har- 
vest beer, it may be found well worthy the attention of 
the farmer at a season when mangel-wurzel cannot be 
procured. The yeast which it affords will be found ex- 
cellent for bdcing.

CHAPTER XXIIL 
KITCHEN GARDEN. 

In the following directions for the caltnre of kitchen 
vegetables, none are included which, in the climate of 
Britain, require the aid of artificial heat to bring tbem to 
maturity ; as it is presumed, that when such are desired, 
an educated professional gardener will be employed, to 
whom the instructions here submitted, as they must ne- 
cessarily be of a limited nature, might possibly be of little 
use. But it is confidently anticipated, that the directions 
which are given, if closely followed, will be found suffi- 
cient, in ordinary cases, to produce the desired result. 

In choosing the situation most suitable for a kitchen 
garden, it will be necessary to regai'd the aspect, or expo* 
sure, of the ground ; a southern exposure being always 
considered much better than any other ; and a gentle decH- 
vity in that direction being very desirable. It should be 
screened to the north and west by a plantation of forest 
trees ; and, on these sides, the trees may be less than a hon- 
dred yards from the garden ; but to the south and east, 
there should be no tall trees^ at least within a considerable 
distance. It is necessary, also, that there should be a 
sufncient BXipp\Y of water within reach ; and standings

KITCHEN GARDEN. 501 

or soft water, is always to be preferred to that taken im- 
mediately from a spring or well. 

The best general soil for a garden is a loam of a mid- 
dling quality, partaking more of the sandy than the clayey 
nature. If a strong and a light soil can both be had, it will 
be so much the better, as the different plants may thus 
have the ground best adapted to their respective kinds. 



^ Cabbages. 

^ The best soil for cabbages is a rich mould, rather 
I clayey than sandy; and it can scarcely be too much 
manured, as they are an exhausting crop. The kinds 
^ generally preferred for summer use, are, the small early 
^ dwai'f, large curly Yorkshire, early dwarf Yorkshire, early 
Battersea, and early su^r-loaf. These are ready for use 
from April or May to July ; for autumn and winter, the 
imperial, large sugar-loaf, hollow sugar-loaf, and the long 
or large-sided. The large Drum, white Strasburg, the 
Scots, and the American cabbage, resist the sererity of 
winter, and grow to a very large size ; but they are coarse 
kinds. The time of sowing for the summer crop is the 
beginning of the August of the preceding year. An 
open spot of rich light earth must be chosen, and the 
seeds of this, and of all the kale tribe, require a covering 
of no more than an eighth, or a quarter of an inch, in 
thickness of mould. In about six or eight weeks after 
the sowing, or when the plants have got several leaves, 
they are thinned ; and those plants taken out of the seed- 
bed are pricked into other beds, at three inches' distance 
every way. By these means, they have room to grow 
firm and shapely. In October and November, part of 
this crop is finally planted out, the remainder early la 



502 KITCHEN GAllDEN. 

the following spring ; and the plants are set in rows be- 
tween two and three feet wide, and two feet asunder ia 
the rows. As the cabbages advance, the earth in the 
TOWS must be stirred, and drawn round the plants ; indeed 
the oftener the earth is stirred, the better will be the 
crop. In the end of April or beginning of May, the 
early cabbages begin to turn in their leaves, and to 
harden in the centre, when, if the leaves be bound close 
with willow twigs, or strands of bass-matting, they will 
be fit for use a fortnight the earlier. If the roots and 
stems of a portion of this crop be allowed to remain af- 
ter the tops are «at eff, and the ground delved, and per- 
haps manured in autumn, very fine cabbages will be 
produced in the January and February following. For 
autumn and winter use, the seeds of cabbages are sown 
in the end of February or beginning of March, pricked 
oat into shady borders in May, and allowed to lemiin 
there for some weeks. In June, they are finally tmo- 
planted, at the same distance as the early kinds. These 
cabbages come to be &t for use in the antmnm montlni 
and continue good, in sheltered situations, and in ordinary 
seasons, till February or March. Of the red cabbagesi 
the dwarf dark-red kind is considered the best ; it may 
be sown about the end of August, and planted out in 
the beginning of April. The white Strasborg is the ▼»> 
riety of which the Germans chiefly make their sour krooti 
The long or large-sided cabbage^ being rather tender) 
should not be sown till May, nor planted out till July. 

Savoys. 

The principal sorts are the yellow and the green; 
the green being considered the hardiest. They are sows 
about the middle of April, and planted out in June, con- 
siderably closer than the common cabbage. If savoys be 
wanted before winter, the seed must be sown in Febniay> 
or even in the autumn before : in the last case, fine lar^ 
plants will be ready for the table in September or Ocio* 
her. The later crop affords a supply till February or 



KITCHEN GAaD£N. 503 

March. SaToys are reckoned better when somewhat 
pinched by the frost. 

If cabbages be planted, year after year, in the same 
ground, they will become sickly and stunted ; it is there- 
fore advisable to change the cabbage ground every year. 

Open Kale. 

Young plants of the common cabbage are now ge- 
nerally used as coleworts ; for this purpose, either the 
sugar-loaf or the large York is sown about the middle 
or end of June, and planted out in the end of July, or 
beginning of August, to be ready for use in winter. 

Scots Kale 

Is sown in the beginning of July ; and in the course of 
the month of August, the young plants are set out in 
rows a foot and a half wide, and ten inches' distance in 
the rows. This green will not be tender until it have en- 
dured some sharp frosts. When kale is planted out, it 
will be necessary to give water to the roots, should the 
weather be dry : no other attention is requisite, except 
that of drawing the earth to the stems before winter. 

Brussels Sprouts 

Are sown in March or April ; the seedlings planted 
out in June preferring showery weather, or watering caie>* 
fully at the root : they are earthed up in October, and 
are ready for use by midwinter. As they grow upright, 
they may be planted closer than other kinds of greensi 

Cauliflower. 

The seed of the early crop of cauliflower is sown about 
the 20th of the August of the preceding year in beds. 
In September the seedlings are pricked into a dry bor- 
der, near a wall, where they may be hooped over, and 
defended with bass mats, daring the severe frosts of win- 
ter. In the month of March they are finally planted 
out, giving water liberally now and afterwards, should 
the weather be dry. Tbej are planted in rows about two 



604 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

feet and a half arander, and two feet apart in the rows ; 
but they mnst not be set deep in the ground. After this 
they must have repeated hoeings, and the earth nrast be 
drawn close up to the roots and stems. To diirersify 
the time of forming heads, some of the early cauliflowers 
are planted out on different successive occasions. Cauli- 
flower will thrive the better that it have liberal supplies 
of the cleanings of the stable and cow-house. 

Brocoli. 

Thbre are many varieties of brocoli ; but the mos 
useful kinds are the dwarf sulphur- coloured, and the kind 
called green brocoli. For an autumn crop, the seed is 
•own in April, and planted out in the beginning of June. 
For a spring crop in the following year, the seed is sown 
late in May, or even in June ; the seedlings are afte^ 
wards placed in nursery beds^ where they reoaain till tbe 
middle or end of July, when they are finally transplanted 
in lines, two feet asunder, and a foot and a half apart in 
the lines. Water is given in dry weather ; and they an 
hoed and earthed up like cauliflower. The heads of win* 
ter brocoli generally appear early in January, and coa- 
tinuo till April. A light and deep, but rich soil, in sd 
opc'u situation, is to be preferred for them. Sea-wreed is 
a useful manure for brocoli, and will prerent the grabs 
infesting its roots. 

Kohl-rabbi. 

Of the khol^rabbi, or turnip-rooted cabfai4^ there nt 
t\ix> varieties ; the one having the stem swelling dbote 
ground ; Uie other having this turnip-like protobennce in

April, iiiuiog a little fine earth with the seed to make it 
divide more equally. A small sowing of this kind may 
be made every month from April to August, in order to 
bare them throughout the summer in a young state for 
the table. For a winter crop, the yellow Dutch turnip 
is considered superior to any other kind; it is sown 
thickly about the middle of July ; and, if rain do not oc- 
cur, frequent watering will be necessary. When the root 
leaves are about an inch broad, the young plants are 
thinned to within six or eight inches* distance from each 
other. To prevent the ravages of the turnip-fly, it is ad- 
visable to dust quick-lime lightly over the crop while it 
is in the seed-leef. Should the young plants threaten to 
run to flower, they may be trodden down^ by gently pla- 
cing the foot on the centre of the plant. If turnips be 
allowed to remain in the ground throughout the winter, 
the top leaves form excellent greens early in spring. The 
Swedish, the stone, and the yellow, are all likewise good 
winter turnips. 

Carrot. 

Carrots thrive best in a light soil, with a mixture of 
sand ; it should be delved very deep, or even trenched, 
and, at the same time, well broken with the spade.. 
Pigeon's dung added to the carrot ground promotes their 
health, by preventing the attacks of insects ; when any 
6ther manure is used, it should be buried deep, that the 
roots may not touch it. In general, it is best to make 
the carrots the second crop after manuring. For the prin- 
cipal crop, the orange carrot, or the red or field carroty 
is preferred ; it is sown in March or April — ^in light 
soils not till the end of April or beginning of May. The 
seeds must be rubbed between the bands with some dry 
sand to separate them ; and, as they are very light, a calm 
day must be chosen ; they should be trodden in before 
raking. When the plants come up, several successive 
boeings are given ; at first with a three-inch, and latterly 
with a six-inch hoe. The plants are thinned either by^ 



606 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

drawing yoiiDg plants for use, or by hoeing^ till they are 
within eight or ten inches of each other^ if broadcast ; bat 
if in drills, which should be a foot apart, till they are six 
or 8e?en inches separate. If the hoeing is not done in 
showery weather, a reg^olar watering most be giiren after 
the operation. For an eariy crop, the early horn-carrot 
is Qsed ; it is sown before the first of Febmaryy in a warn 
border, which must be hooped o^er, and covered with 
mats daring frost. A bed of the late horn-carrot maybe 
sown in June or July, to afford young roots in the autumn 
months. Carrots are taken up at the first approach of 
winter, cleaned, and stored up with sand in a place that 
will exclude the frost. 

Parsnip. 

This plant requires a stronger soil than the carrot ; it 
prefers a light loam ; but any soil will do, provided it be 
pretty deep. The seed, which should never be more 
than a year old, is sown in March ; the plants are afitar* 
wards thinned out to about eight or ten inches asunder, 
and are kept clear of weeds. When the leaves begin to 
decay, the roots are fit for use. They may be stored as 
carrots ; or, as frost will not injure them, they may be 
allowed to remain in the ground till the beginning of 
February ; but not longer, as then the flower-stalks begin 
to form, when the roots would become stringy^ 

Scorzonera. 

The seeds of scorzonera are sown in the middle ot 
April, in a cool deep soil, in drills about a foot separate. 
Afterwards the plants are thinned out to within four 
inches apart. The roots may be either lifted in November, 
and stored as carrots, or they may remain in the ground 
all winter. 

Salsify. 

Salsify is sown in April, and afterwards thinned to 
within six or eight inches apart. A mellow and deep 
soil affords the besl ^lauts. The roots may remain in 



KITCHEN GARDEN. 507 

the groandi and be taken up as wanted throughout the 
winter. 

Skirret. 

A LIGHT deep soil is most suitable for tlie skirret, and 
should it be naturally moist, so much the better. In dry 
soils, or in long-continued droughts, watering is advi- 
sable. The seeds are sown in April, and repeated thin- 
ning and hoeing are necessary. When the leaves begin 
to decay in autumn, the roots are fit for use ; they will 
not be injured by frost, and may therefore remain in the 
ground till wanted. 

Red Beet. 

Ued beet requires a light, bat rich soil, of considerap 
b)e depth, that has not been recently manured. The 
ground should be trenched, or very deeply delved, and 
broken small with the spade. The seed is sown in Aprils 
in drills an inch deep, and fifteen inches asunder. In 
autumn, beet-root is generally stored amongst sand in a 
cellar, or some place that will completely exclude the 
frost. In lifting it, great care must be taken that the roota 
be not anywise injured or brokmi, as they bleed much i 
for the same reason, the leaves most be cat off at least an 
inch above the top of the root. 

White Beet. 

This kind of beet is cultivated only for its leaves, 
which are used as spinach. The seeds are sown in the 
beginning of March, in an open spot of groiond. When 
the plants have put out four leaves, they are hoed, and 
thinned out to at least foar inches asunder. A month 
afterwards a second hoeing is given, leaving the plants 
about eight inches separate. The outer leaves being first 
picked off for use, a succession is afiorded for the whole 
season. 

Jerusalem Artichoke. 

This plant is propagated by means of the tubeoa^ 



508 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

which are cut in the manner of potato-sets, and planted 

in any light soil and open situation, in the end of March. 

They are placed in rows three feet asunder^ and a foot 

or fifteen inches apart in the rows. In September they 

are fit for use, and may be left in the ground^ and dug up 

as wanted throughout the winter, being best when newly 

raised. 

* 

Potato. 

The varieties of the potato are very numerous ; and 
as no particular kind will continue in perfection much 
more than fourteen years, new kinds are continually suc- 
ceeding those that have worn out. At present, for a 
summer crop, the ash-leaved^ early dwarf, and champion, 
are esteemed ; and, for the wmter crop, the American, 
large and small, and the kidney, are excellent. They 
will thrive in any light soil, in a free airy situation ; and 
if quantity of produce be particularly desired, too much 
manure can hfu*dly be given ; but they will be of a more 
delicate flavour from ground not recently enriched. The 
potato is propagated by cuts of the Inbens, leaving one 
or two eyes or buds to each cut, and eradicating all clus- 
tered eyes. The best shaped and cleanest potatoes are 
selected for this purpose ; and the cuts are the better for 
being allowed to dry for a day or two before planting. 
They are planted in drills, and covered to the depth of 
three or four inches ; and for the early crop, which may 
be planted in a light warm border, about the beginning 
or middle of March, sixteen inches between the lines, and 
seven or eight inches between each plant, is sufficient ; 
but, for the principal crop, which must be planted about 
the middle or end of April, two feet is allowed between 
the rows, and from ten to fifteen inches between the 
plants. The only attention the crop requires is hoeing, 
and drawing the earth to the stems. The oftener this 
last operation is performed, the greater will be the pro- 
duce. The early planted potatoes will be fit for use in 
June and July. Only a few of them should be taken up 
at a time, as t^xe^ Yf'\\\ iio\. k«^i^ ^ood beyond a day or 



KITCHEN GiiRDEN. 509 

two. la autumn the principal crop will be known to be 
ripe, when the tops of the plants change to a yellow 
colour ; they should then be taken up, and stored in as 
clean and dry a state as possible. The best way of keep- 
ing them is in heaps on the ground, covering well with 
straw and earth, so as completely to exclude the frost. 

Peas. 

If peas be sown in newly-enriched ground, they will 
be apt to run to haums ; they are therefore seldom sown 
till the second year after manuring. Some of the early 
kinds, as the Charleton, golden, and Reading, are gene- 
rally sown towar<is the end of October, in front of a south 
wall ; and if slightly protected by means of branches of 
evergreens, or old peas-haum, the crop will survive the 
winter, and produce young peas by the end of May. In 
January and February, more of the early sorts are sown 
for a succession ; and in March and April, full crops of 
the later peas must be sown. Some of the smaller late 
kinds, as the blue Prussian, dwarf marrowfat, Spanish 
dwarf, and Leadmaa's dwarf, if well earthed up, and the 
rows not too near each other, may do without sticking. 
Of the large and late kinds, the tall marrowfat, green 
marrowfat, grey rounceval, and the sugar pea, have long . 
retained their character. The ]ai*ge kinds require nearly 
four feet distance between the rows. The young plants 
are frequently hoed ; when they are three or four inches 
high, the earth is drawn to the rows ; and when about 
eight or ten inches high, they must be sticked ; the 
smallest kinds may have sticks three feet, tbb early sorts 
and dwarf marrowfat five feet, and the larger sorts seven 
or eight feet high. When branches for sticking cannot 
he procnred> two lines of strong packthread, on each 
side of the rows, may be substituted. To prevent the 
attacks of mice, it is necessary to be careful, in sow- 
ing peas, that none be left exposed on the surface of the 
ground. 



510 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

Beans. 

The early sorts, such as the Mazs^n and Lisbon^ 
are sown in the end of October, in front of a.wa]) or 
hedge. The plants are earthed up in November^ as tbey 
adyance ; but, in earliiing up beans, it is necessary to be 
yery careful that the earth do not fall on the centre of 
the plant. In severe frost some haum or fern is laid 
over them. In March and Aprils as they begin to show 
flower, they are kept dose to the fence by means of pack- 
thread ; and, in order to forward the production of pods, 
when tlie lower blossoms begin to fade, the tops of the 
stems are pinched off. In February and March, fsll 
crops of the late and large beans, as the Windsor, Sand- 
wich, and long podded, are planted in drills two inches 
deep, allowing two and a halif or three feet between the 
rows. 

Kidney, or French Bean. 

The dwarf kidney-bean requires no support from 
sticks, but, as it is tender, must be sown before the mid- 
dle or eud of April ; it may then be sown in drills, from 
two to three feet asunder, and about three inches sepa- 
rate in the lines, covering with something less than two 
inches of soil. As the plants advance, they are hoed 
and cleared of weeds, a little earth being, at the same 
time, drawn to the stems. The most esteemed Idnds 
are, the speckled dwarf, early black or negro, and etriy 
white dwarf. The scarlet runner, being more tender than 
the dwarf kinds, must not be 8o^vn till about the middle 
of May ; and, as tall slight stakes must be placed for it 
to climb upon, the distance between the rows is general- 
ly four feet. The kidney-beans like a good, light, rich 
soil. 

Spinach. 

There are two kinds of spinach ; the prickly-seeded, 
for winter, and the smooth-seeded, for summer use. Tlie 
winter ciop \a Bovm, «i\\)aKs Vcl ^x^iis^ or broadcast, in the 



I 



KITCHEN GARDEN. 511 

beginniog of Angust, when rains may be expected. A 
light, dry, but rich soil, in a sheltered situation, is desi- 
rable. When the plants show four leaves, the ground 
aronnd them is hoed, and the spinach moderately thin- 
ned ; the hoeing is repeated as the weeds grow. In 
February, when a few dry days may occur, the surface 
of the ground is stirred, the plants cleaned, and agaia 
^nned out. With this mode of treatment, and with 
due attention, the winter spinach should afford success* 
ive gatherings from November^ and, in mild weather^ 
throughout the winter, till April or May. The first 
sowing of the summer spinach is made in a sheltered 
border in January. If sown broadcast, it is first thinned 
out to three inches, and, at subsequent hoeings, to eight 
or ten inches apart. Successive sowings are made in 
February, Mardi^ and April ; and these are at once 
thinned out to six or eight inches apart. . 

Asparagus. 

Asparagus is of two kinds ; the red-topped, which 
produces the larger shoots^ and the green-topped, whick 
are considered of the more delicate flayour. The best 
way of propagating asparagus is by means of seed. la 
the month of March it is sown in shallow drills, six 
inches asunder, and earthed in from half an inch to an 
inch deep. The young plants are kept as free of weeds 
as possible during the summer ; and in the end of Oc- 
tober, some litter is spread over the snrfJBLce oi the ground 
to protect them from frost. In the following spring, 
about April, the seedlings are transplanted to the quarter 
in which they are to remain. The soil of this quarter 
must not be less than two and a half feet deep ; it should 
be light, but rich ; damp ground, or a wet subsoil, would 
be very unsuitable; nothing is better than a sandy loam, 
well mixed with rotten dung, or sea-weed ; and before 
planting a bed, it should be well trenched over to the depth 
of the soil, burymg abundance of manure in the bottom. 
The seedling plants are cautiously raised with a narrow- 
pronged foric ; and Jwhen they are taken u^^ th& i^&KsMk 



512 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

are kept in a little earth till replanted : they being very 
apt to be injured by exposure to the air. A trencb, 
about six inches deep, being prepared, the roots are care- 
fuUy laid in, a foot distant from each other^ the budi 
or crowns being kept upright^ and about two inches be- 
low the surface. A foot between each ordinary trendi 
is reckoned sufficient, but between every four rows a 
double distance is left for an alley. In dry weather the 
new-planted beds should be carefully watered. Serenl 
hoeings, generally three, are given in the course of the 
summer. In the end of September, the haum decays, 
and is cut away ; and small stable-dung or sea-weed is 
spread on the bed, previously stirring the surface with 
a fork. In spring, just before the buds begin to appear, 
the intervals of the beds are slightly delved over with 
the narrow-pronged fork, raking afterwards, with great 
delicacy of hand. The same practice, both for antuma 
and spring, is observed for the second year, it being only 
in the third year after planting out^ or the fourth from 
the time of sowing, that cutting for the table is begun. 
In April a few shoots may generally be cut ; in May and 
June they will be plentiful. In the first productive sea- 
son only the large shoots are taken, but in subsequent 
years all the shoots are gathered as they advance till the 
end of the month of June. Shoots, two inches under 
ground, and three or four above, are the best for the 
table ; and, in cutting them, some of the earth is first re- 
moved, in order to avoid the succeeding buds below. An 
asparagus quarter should not contain less than a fall of 
ground, as it often takes that quantity to furnish a good 
dish at one time. 

Sea-Kale. 

The best mode of propagating sea-kale is by sowing 
it. The soil intended for it should be sandy and light, 
but mixed with fiae rich mould ; and of all manures for 
this crop, drift- ware or sea- weed is the best. The ground 
must be trenched at least two feet deep, and in March 
the seed is sown, «i\)0\xX X^o \Tvdi^<& dee^ ; they may be 



KITCHEN GARDEN. 513 

set in a triangnlar form, six inches apart, leaving a space 
of two feet between the triangles. To ensure a produce^ 
it may be as well to drop in two or more seeds into each 
hole^ and to thin out afterwards the superfluous plants. 
For the first summer no attention will be required in the 
culture, except that of keeping the plants clear of weeds. 
In November the whole bed is covered with rotten stable- 
litter, as is done with asparagus. During the second year 
the same plan is/ollowed. In the third year most of the 
plants will be strong enough to be blanched for use ; this 
is done by placing blanching covers over the plants as 
soon as the leaves are decayed in the end of autumn, and 
then covering up the whole bed with stable-dung, pack- 
ing it closely between the pots, and heaping it over the 
tops of them to the depth of six inches or more. By this 
mode the sea-kale will be fit for cutting in January and 
February. If the heat of the litter at any time decline, 
which may be easily ascertained by introducing a ther-' 
mometer into several of the blanching pots, some new 
stable- dung must be mixed with it. The blanching pots, 
mentioned above, are made for the purpose ; they have 
movable covers that fit down closely, and they are near- 
ly as wide at top as at bottom, in order to give room for 
cutting such shoots as may be ready, without breaking 
the others. It is necessary to have from thirty to fifty of 
such covers. A less expensive mode of blanching is, by 
covering the sea-kale beds to the depth of a foot and a 
half with leaves as they fall from the trees in autumn, 
adding, over all, a very slight layer of long stable-litter 
to prevent the leaves being blown about. In this man- 
ner the shoots will be very sweet and tender ; but they 
will not be produced so early as by the former method. 

Onions. 

The soil for onions should be light, and not recently 
manured ; it should be well delved and broken fine, and 
exactly levelled. There are several varieties in use, but 
the Strasburg may be mentioned as being as good as any. 
For the principal crop, the seed is sown in February or

it is better to defer the sowing till the esd of March oc

ly smoothed over with the rake. A first hoeiDg ia g^fct

growth, and they are then thinned oat wiA the haad.^ 
about four inches apart. Another hoeing ia givea ahoat 
a month or six weeks afterwa]:ds, wheii tlM» plants ait 
s^led out to about six inches square. After this tks 
hoe must never be used, but any large weeda most bs 
drawn out with the hand. If the weatb^ be dry at tU 
time of thinning, a plentiful watering must ivimedi^Btely 
afterwards be given. About the end of Augoat the 
qrop will be known to be ripe by the leayea falling dow& 
The onions are then drawn, and laid out on a gravd vilk 
in some dry spot, and occasionally turned. In a iioct- 
night they are generally found to be firm eaoi^h te 
keeping, and must be stored in a dry garret oi: loli» ei- 
eluding them as much as may be from the air. TSa 
crop of winter onions is sown in August or beginning of 
September ; tbey are thinned in the usual way, and weedi 
must be carefully kept down. In the spring, when the 
keeping onions fail, part of these may be drawn for un^ 
the remainder will be ready in the early part of summer- 
About the month of May, any of the stalks which appeu 
to be pushing a flower-stem must be thrown out, and» 
to check this tendency, the rest of this crop should be 
laid down, which is done by passing the handle of a nke 
horizontally along the bed, so as to strike the stems ib 
inch or two above the bulb, and bend them flat down. 
Winter onions thus managed may be taken up about the 
end of June, and are generally firm, and keep long. For 
pickling, the small silver-skinned variety is best ; thef 
should be sown pretty thickly about the middle of Apiii* 
in light and very poor land, as they are not required d 
a large size for this purpose ; they need not be thinned, 
unless when they rise absolutely in clusters. They i^l 
be fit for use Vn j^M^M^t.

Leek. 

Lbsks aes" rabed much in lihe same way as oniooB* 
There are Uiree varieties of thenii ; the narrow-leaved ok 
£laaders> the hroad-leaved or tall London, and the Scotch 
or flag^leek ; this last is by much the most hardy. The^p 
ane,. about the beginning of March, sown closely in bedsi 
aod in June or July are planted out in rows^ first trim* 
ming off the lips of the leaves and the points of the £«* 
Irons rootSk A good way is, to make a deep hole with 
a dibble, and merely lay in the leek plant up to the leavaS) 
without closing the earth about it ; this encourages the 
stem to swell and lengthen, while at the same time it 
blanches it. But this plan may be adopted only in moist 
ireather, or the plants must be well watered, to ensure 
their taking root. If the leaves be topped two or three 
times during the summer, the leeks will grow to a larger 
size. They are ready for use in autunm and winter. 

Cibol. 

Cibol s are raised from seeds, which are sown in July. 
The seedling plants soon appear ^ but, in the course of 
the montii of October, the leaves go off, and lite ground 
seems quite bare. In January, however, they again be*- 
gin to shoot, and by March they are fit for use. 

Chives. 

, Chivbs are readily propagated by parting the roota^ 
either in autumn or spring, and they will grow in any 
aoil or situation. They should be repeatedly cut during 
the summer, the successive leaves produced in this way 
being more tender. A small bed or border thus managed 
will afford a sufficient supply; it will continue productive 
for three or four years, when a new plantation should be 
made. 

Garlic. 

Garlic has a bulbous root, made up of a dozen or 
fifteen smaller bulbs, called cloves ; it is propagated by 



516 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

detaching the cloves, and planting them. The soil shotdd 
he light and dry, well delved, and broken fine. The sets 
are placed four inches distant from each other in every 
direction, and between two and three inches deep. Tht 
smaller the cloves, the more healthy and prodnctive will 
be the plants. They are put in in February or Maich; 
about the middle of June the leaves are tied in knots, to 
prevent the stronger plants from running to flower. The 
crop is taken up in August, when the leaves begin to 
wither. The roots are tied in bunches, and hong in a 
dry room for use. 

Shalot. 

The culture of the shalot is very similar to that of f 
garlic. They are planted about the middle of October, 
the ground having been previously manured with <^ 
well-rotted dung, mixed with house-ashes. The crop n 
taken up in the end of summer, when the leaves become 
discoloured, and the bulbs are hung up in nets, in a eoA 
airy place, for use. 

Artichoke. 

Artichokes may be planted in any open situation. 
They are propagated by means of rooted slips, or suckers, 
talien off at the time of the spring dressing, in the b^in- 
ning of April. They like a light loam, cool, but dry, and 
which is at the same time rich and deep. In preparing 
for this crop, the soil should be trenched to the depth il 
three feet, and manure should be liberally supplied at 
the bottom of the trench. The plants may be placed 
four feet apart every way; and at the end of the first 
season after planting, a small and late crop of artichokes 
may generally be cut in October. In the second yeir 
they will be plentiful ; and in autumn, as soon as all tbe 
heads are gathered, the whole stalks are broken down 
close to the gi'ound. In November a portion of earth is 
drawn towards each plant, and some long dung, peas- 
haum, or the like, is laid around, but kept at some dis- 
tance from tY\^ sletfts wv<\ Wve% of the plants. In Marck 



^

or April, the litter and earth are removed^ the stocks are 
examined^ and two or three of the strongest and beet 
shoots being selected for growing up, the rest are detach- 
ed. Every season, at the winter dressing, some small 
rotted dung or fresh sea-weed should be dug into the 
ground. It is advisable to renew the artichoke planta- 
tion every six years. 

Cardoon. 

The best soil for cardoons is one that is light, and not 
too rich ; but it ought to be deep. The seed is sown in 
the middle or end of May^ in small hollows, about three 
inches deep, and four feet distant from each other every 
way. Two or three seeds are placed in each hollow to 
ensure a crop, but only the strongest plant is allowed to 
remain. The cardoon requires a good deal of water^ and 
in very dry weather^ this should be copiously supplied. 
In September^ when the leaves will be large, they are 
tied up with hay or straw bands for blanching, leaving 
only the top free, but a dry day must be selected for the 
purpose ; at the same time a hillock of earth is formed 
around each plant to the height of a foot or eighteen 
inches, and this is smoothed on the surface that the rain 
may run off, and not fall into the centre of the plants. 
As they advance in growth, additional bands of straw are 
added, and the earth is raised higher. They will be ready 
for use in two months after the commencement of the 
blanching. In severe frost, the tops are covered with 
haum or long litter. 

Lettuce. 

Of each of the two kinds of lettuce, the coss, also call- 
ed the Roman and ice, and the cabbage lettuce, there are 
many varieties. Of the coss lettuces, the Egyptian green, 
the white coss or Versailles, and the royal cape lettuce, 
are esteemed ; of the cabbage lettuces, the imperial and 
grand admiral, or admiral. The large Roman and the 
Cilicia lettuces are those chiefly used in soups. The 
seed is sown broadcast, and merely raked into the ground.

The green cnrled-leared and the white curled 
are the best kinds ; the green curled-leared, being t

of May and middle of June ; another sowings is i 
July. When the seedlings are three or four inch 
they are transpknted into a well-prepared bed 
soil, in rows a foot asunder, at the distance of tei 
from each other in the row. In dry weather, y 
is necessary. The blanching must next be comn 
it is accomplished, when the plants are perfectly 
tying up tluB heads with strands of bass-mat ; soin 
is requisite in gathering the leaves together in 
order, so as not to cross each other, and in rejecti 
leaves as are unliealtliy. The plants are, at iii 
two inches below the top, afterwards about the 
of the plant. In three weeks or a month thev 
found to be sufficiently blanched ; but as they\i 
tinue in this state fit for use only a fortnight 
plants must be tied up every week in order to t!

mode adopted is, to make some trenches, and to » 
plants in them nearly to the head, where they will

Celery. 

iTHfi&E are two varieties, one with hallow, the o&er 
with solid stalks ; the solid stalk is gene^lly preferred ; 

'Vlillther Variety, wi^ large red stalks, is also esteemed. 

''Celery must be sown at several different times, in order 
to ensure a succession of plants fit for transplanting at va- 
rious seasons. The first sowing is commonly made aboUt 
the end of March or beginning of April, in a sheltered 
border; the next about the beginning of May, on a moist 
'border. About the end of April, the plants of the i&rst 

* AAowmg will be ready for pricking into nursery beds <6f 

«lrich earth, in #hiieh they may Btand three or four inches 
■aeparato* Water is given, and the plants art shaded 

- ftitoi the sun for a few days. A quantity of every su^- 

< iMssive sowing should be thus pricked out^ in order itt) 
^atrengthen them. Towards the end of May, the most 

'forward plants may be transplanted into tnenches hr 
Matching. In dry weather, at this season, water is giveh 
freely both to the 'ti-ansplanted plants ond those left in 
the seed-bed. The usual mode of transplanting and 
blanching is the following :— Trenches are ^rmed at the 
distance of three or four feet from each other, a foot and 
ft half wide, and about a foot in depth. The soil in the 
bottom of this trench is delved and worked fine, and a 
little rotten dung is mixed with it. The soil for celery 
should be deep and rich, somewhat moist, yet of a. light 
nature. The earth taken from the trench is laid in ridges 
en each side, ready to be drawn in as wanted. ThiB 
plants, having the tops of the long leaves cut off, and any 
side-shoots removed, are placed ib the bottom of the 
trenches, at the distance of four or five inches from each 
other ; as they advance in growth^ the earth is drawn in 
towartfe them, perhaps once in ten days, taking care to 



520 KITCHEN GARDEN. 

do Ms in dry weather, and not to cover the centre of 
the plants with soil. When the plants rise coiisidefably 
above the surface of the ground, the earth laid in ridges 
will be exhausted ; a new trench must^ therefore, now be 
opened between each row, for a supply of soil to coati- 
nue the earthing up till the leaf stalks of the celery be 
blanched to the length of from eight to fourteen inches. 
The last sowing is destined to stand the winter ; and the 
soil into which this is finally transplanted, should be as 
dry as possible. In severe weather, peas-haum or koie 
litter is thrown over the beds. In lifting the plants for 
use, it is proper to dig deep, that the main root may net 
be injured. 

Garden Cress and Mustard. 

These may be sown, thickly, in close drills, <» a 
warm border, at the bottom of a south wall, about the 
middle of March. Throughout the summer they ahovld 
be sow|i once a-fortnight, as they are used only while 
quite young and tender. Besides the plain sort of ga^ 
den cress, there is a variety with curled leaves, whicbf 
being the more hardy of the two, may be sown later in 
the season. This kind requires, to be thinned out to half 
an inch asunder. The white mustard is the best kind 
for sowing along with the garden cress, and for using in 
salad. 

French and Common Sori'el. 

The French sonel thrives best in a light sandy soil. 
It is easily propagated by means of offsets, or by seeds ; 
if in the first way, the plants are placed a foot apart. 
The only attention the crop requires is that of cutting cS 
the flower stems in the month of July. The plants 
should be renewed every four or five years. Common 
8011*01 thrives best in a shady border. It is easily raised 
from seed sown early in spring. 

Radish. 
There are the spindle-rooted and turnip-rooted n- 



KITCHEN GARDEN. '521 

' dishes ; of the turnip- rooted variety, there is a white and 
' a red kind. The short-topped purple or the pink radish, 
both spindle-rooted, may he sown for the earliest crop in 
-the beginning of November, in a sheltered border; and 
they will be ready for drawing early in Marcl). More seed 
is sown in December and January, and sowings are con- 
tinued once a-fortnight until April, in order to secure a 
succession of young roots. Any sort of soil will suit this 
plant. In the end of March, should the weather happen 
, to be very dry, the crops must be regularly watered ; a 
^ slight covering of fern is useful early in spring, when 
. sharp frosts occur ; it may be raked off in the day time, 
and restored at night. If radishes are to be drawn smaD, 
they may stand at two inches apart ; but if it be intended 
' that the roots should grow large, they must be allowed 
twice that distance. The turnip-rooted radish is sown 
in February or March, and thinned out with a small hoe 
to within six inches apart. 

Indian Cress, or Nasturtium. 

A FRESH, but poor soil, is better for this plant than 
a rich one. . The seeds' may be sown in April, in drills 
about two inches deep. The plants must have a support, 
as the stalks will grow to the height of six or eight feet. 
The seeds will be ready for use in August or September. 
There is also a dwarfish variety, which may be allowed 
. to spread on the ground. 

Burnet. 

A FEW plants duly of this are sufficient It may be 

- raised from seeds sown in autumn, or by parting the 

roots. The stems should be two or three times cut over 

• in summer. 

Horse-Radish. 

The soil for horse-radish should be rich and deep. It 
is propagated by cuttings of the knotty parts of the root, 

• provided these be furnished with one or two eyes. They 
are planted in February or March, in lines, leaving a foot 



iSS2 KrrcoES OASBca^

Parsley. 

Th£ corled panley is the preferable vaitety« It va^ 
he raised in drills on the edge of a bordeiw The see^i 
which lie lor a month or six wedu in the fitmnd bete 
springing, may be sown in Febmary or «arly in Martk

«Br, some larch or beech branches may be laid over the 
parsley borders ; and in hard weather, alMyvv these an 
spread dry bean-hanBa^ feni» or reedk 

Angelica. 

Angelica is easily raised from seed, which shonld be 
sown soon after it is gathered. It grows best in a moist 
soil, and thrives exceedingly well by the side of a ditcb. 
Though a biennial plant, it may be made to continne for 
several years, by cutting down the flower stem before it 
ripen to seed. 

Rhubarb. 

The kind cultivated for the table is called monk's 
rhubarb. It is propagated by means of ofisets, which 
should be planted any time between November and ¥^ 
bniary, in good soil, at the distance of three feet from 
each other. If the rhubarb plants be covered in No- 
vember with a good deal of stable-litter, the leaves will 
shoot up very early in spring, and their stalks will be im- 
proved by the blanching they will in this way receive. 



HERBS. 

Sage. 

Thk Bed idnd is piefeixed for IritclMn nm; nd thft 
lighter and yoocer the aoii k, the hetter will (he tagfe 
plants stand the winter. It is propagated in the spring by 
slips, and in the summer h y mrtt i ii gs. The cuttings should 
be five or six inches^ long, stripped of all the lower leaves, 
and plunged nearly to the tc^ in the earth, heing at the 
■aame time well wtttered. The plaats should he removed 
eyery three or four years. 

Clary. 

Clary is propagated by seeds sown in spring, trans- 
planting the seedlings, la the summer months, to fifteen 
inches ^Mort* 

Mints. 

Spearmint is the kind required for culinary purposes, 
peppermint being little used, except for distilling. These 
mints like a moist soil, and are readily propagated by 
•lips in spring, by parting the roots in autumn, and by 
, neans of cuttings in summer. In the latter end of sum- 
mer, when the spearmint is coming into flower, it may be 
gathered, dried gradually in the shade, and kept for win. 
ter use. As mint plants wte sometimes destroyed in very 
aevere frost, it is advisable to covser them slightly with 
peasJiaBm or fern before winter. 

Thyme. 

Thyme grows best in a light dry soil that has not been 
-xecently manured ; it is propagated by parting the roots, 
planting slips, or by sowing the seed in spring. 



SM KITCHSN GABDBH. 

Marjoram. 

SwEET-MABJORAM, or knoUed-iiiaijonuDy is jHupi- 
gated by seed, a little of which should be sown enrj 
spring. Pot-marjoram is easily propagated by slips or 
cuttings, and is sufficiently hardy to withstand onr win- 
ters. Winter sweet-marjoram requires a sheltered bor- 
der and a dry soil. It is a p^nennial plant, and is propa- 
gated by parting the roots in antumn. For -winter use, 
both the kinds of sweet-marjoram should be dried slowly 
in the shade^ and afterwards hmig np in a dry place. 

Savory. 

Winter savory is 'propag a ted by slips, or by cut- 
tings of the yoimg roots^ and also by seeds. It is Jbardy, 
and continues good for sereral years, especially in poor 
soils. Summer savory must be sown every spring, in 
shallow drills, thinly; the drills being eight or nine indw 
apart. 

Tarragon. 

ly a dry loamy soil, tarragon proves quite a bardy plaat ; 
but it is apt to perish in a wet situation. It is ea^y pro- 
pagated by parting the roots, or by planting in the spring 
young shoots with only two or three fibres. 

Tansy. 

Tansy is extremely hardy, and will grow in any soil 
It is easily propagated at any season by parting the 
roots. 

Hyssop. 

A POOR dry soil is most suitable to hyssop. It may 
be propagated in the spring months by seeds, by rooted 
slips, and by cuttings. 

Costmary. 

CosTMARY does best in a dry soil. It is prc^pagiled 
by parting tbe loota \iv antumn. 



KITCHEN OAHDEN. 525 

Rosemary. 

KosEMARY is easily propagated by slips or cattings in 
spring. It should be planted in a dry soil, in a sheltered 
situation ; but if its roots enter the crevices at the base of 
an old wall, the plant will not be injured by the severest 
frosts. 

Lavender. 

Lavender is propagated by cuttings, in young slips^ 
any time in the spring months. It should be planted in 
a dry, gravelly^ or poor soil. 

Balin. 

Balm is readily propagated by parting the roots, pre- 
serving two or three buds to each piece; or by slips, 
either in autumn or spring. In order to have young 
leaves all the summer, some of the stalks should be cut 
down every month. The balm plantation need not be 
renewed oftener than every third or fourth year. 

Coriander. 

The seeds of coriander should be sown in autumn, 
and the plants afterwards thinned out to five or six inches 
asunder. 

Caraway. 

The caraway is a biennial plant, and should be sown 
soon after the seed is ripe, in autumn, thinning out the 
plants the next spring, to within four or six inches apart. 
A moist soil suits the caraway the best. 

Samphire. 

Samphire is not easily cultivated ; it seems to suc- 
ceed best in a rich light soil, having sand and gravel mix- 
ed with it. It must be in a well-sheltered situation, and 
requires to be freely watered in dry weather, till the 
roots have struck deep among the soil. If a few plants can 
be induced to take root in an <^d wall, or pn an artificial 
rock-work, they will have a good chaiv^^ ^i t«i!Ms>5i\as|^. 



CHAPTER XXIV. 
ON KBESk 

The Apiary 

Should be situated so tliat the hives may have ts 
orach SOB) and shelter from the wind, as poasiUe. A km 
low trees or shmbe may be planted in the Tieimty, to v- 
nst the flight of the swarms, bnt all mbbirii and noKkna 
weeds must be earefolly removed. TIm hives oh e ni d ha 
placed on pedestals, about two feet fimn the grmmd, and 
never less than ^y% or six yards (rem eaefa other. Of 
whatever form they be made, the material best suited 
for their constmction is straw. When a hive is to be 
purchased, let it be chosen in the middle of die day; that 
which has the greatest number of bees going in with yel- 
low pellets attached to their 1^ may be selected for 
farther examination. The interior should be crowded with 
bees, the comb of a yellow hue, and the side ones filled ; 
if there be many queen cells, which are like small in- 
verted acorns att»rhed to the sides of the combs, or if 
the wings of the bees should be ragged or torn, the hive 
is certainly old, and ought to be rejected. If a hive is 
to be purchased in spring, its weight should not be less 
tlian fifteen pounds ; if in autumn, not less than thirty ; 
and if it is a stock hive, the weight should not be less 
than forty pounds. A good hive having been selected, 
it may be removed in the evening, and placed on its 
le pedestal ; but it should not be plastered to the stool. 
j.ne stand on which the hive is placed shonld be cleaned

Should they ftt this season become unhealthy, a renova- 
tion of air Difty be beneficial, and weve the hiyea to re** 
nwin an hois* turned u^ it would be OMfcher an advantage 
thaa^ otherwise. Where theie is not a little nmning stream . 
in the neighbouriiood of the apiary, trough with waten 
should be placed near the hiTes. They may be made o£ 
stone or wood, the wood well pitched^ of «ight or tent 
inches in depth, and sunk in the earth. A few inches ol: 
mould may be put in the bottom^ and some waite^•cre8ee8 
planted therein^ to presenre the purity of the water> with, 
which they should be constantly supplied ; or^ put one oi 
two pieces of wood in a basin ^ watsr^ and place it near 
the hive. 

. Spring and autumn are the- seasons for* feeding the^ 
weak hives, beginning in February if the weather be fine^. 
The food most approved of for them is a sirup compoeed.^ 
of sugar or treacle, ale, and salt, m the proportion of two- 
pints of ale to a pound of sugar, and about half an ounce- 
of salt, the whole to be boiled a quarter of an hour, and: 
carefully skimmed ; when cold, it should be botded, cork- 
ed, and, to prevent its candying, kept for use in a warm 
{dace. In the beginning of the season, a little- por^.> 
wine incoxporated with the food, may prevent dysenterjit 
When the bees to be fed are in a plain cottage hive^ an 
eek must be provided, of the same diameter as li» Mvek 
When the sun is set, and the bees all returned from the- 
fields, let the hives be gently raised, and the eek placed 
on the stool ; fill an empty comb with the food» place it 
in the cell, and replace the hive upon it ; the bees will be 
less disturbed, if a slip of the eek be made to open, large 
enough to admit the piece of comb. It should be remo- 
ved on the following morning, if the cold has not prevented 
their taking their usual supply in the nig^t. Should that 
be the case, shut them up for a day or two, to prevent 
the mischief which would occur from strange bees en- 
tering the hive wiule it is feeding, or remove the weak 



528 B££8. 

hive to a considerable distance. A well*peopled bif«- 
will require about two pounds of simp in the monUi. A 
new swarm ought always to be put into a new bive, wfaidi 
sbould be provided in April. Sticks in the inside are 
unnecessary, but tbe projecting straws must be singed 
off. Should any hive in May seem wholly destitute of 
drones — ^in Scotland they do not appear till iJie end of May 
or beginning of June — ^watch at thie entrance of that hive 
which i^pears to have the greatest number of them, and 
catch forty or fifty, confine them in a box till the even- 
ing, when they may be easily introduced, and will be 
most thankfully received by the hive that appears to be 
without them. To supply a hive with a queen, -cut out 
from some of the other hives that can be got at most 
easily, a piece of comb that has eggs in it ; turn up tbe 
queenless hive, and with the left hand, shed two of the 
combs a little asunder, then with the right hand put in 
the piece of comb between them, observing that the 
cells be put in the hive in the same order as in their na- 
tive hive, that is, the cells that were uppermost to be 
so still ; then let the hand be removed, and the hive 
replaced. In England, a swarm may be expected in 
May, but not till June in Scotland ; preceding the swarm- 
ing, may be observed, amongst other signs, small drops 
of perspiration at the entrance, and when the bees cluster 
on the outside of the hive, thfe bee-master must be con- 
stantly on the watch. In general, they will swarm with 
the first sunshine ; but if they continue to lie out when 
the weather is favourable, a little water may be squirted 
on them. The swarm once on the wing, it should never 
be lost sight of. Ringing of bells, and other noises, are 
more likely to do harm than good. It is unnecessary to 
prepare the hive with any thing sweet or odoriferous ; bnt 
if the swarm does not remain in one hive, give them an- 
other. The easiest situation for hiving a swarm is that in 
which the hive can be held under the swarm, and the bees 
shaken into it. In all cases, a goose wing will be found d 
essential service to brush the bees off the post into the 
hive ; but great cai^ m\x%\i\)^\»keu that none of the knota 



BEES. 529 

of bees which may contain the qneen bee, drop upon the 
ground. The hive, when the bees have been all shaken or 
bmshed into it, should be placed on the board, and left 
near the place of the swarm's first settling, until the even- 
ing, when it should be carefully removed and placed on 
a pedestal, at some distance from the parent hive. A se- 
cond swarm may generally be looked for on the eighth or 
tenth day after the first ; sometimes sooner, but never 
later than the twelfth day after. The day before the de- 
parture of the second swarm, the call of the queen bees 
may be distinctly heard ; the note of the one is loud 
and clear, that of the other, the young queen, is lower, 
but equally distinct, and totally different from the hum 
^ of the other bees. As they give no other signal of their 
second swarming, it is necessary to keep a vigilant watch 
over the hives, to ascertain from which the swarm de- 
parts. It is generally necessary to return the second 
swarm to the parent hive immediately. They are seldom 
or never worth preserving as a separate colony, except 
when two fly off together, in which case they become, 
by a union, of little inferior value to a first swarm. Sup- 
posing the two swarms to have alighted upon separate 
branches, proceed to shake one of them into the empty 
hive, and then immediately shake the other into the same, 
leaving it to the bees to kill the superfluous quee^.bee, 
that is, if the proprietor has not the skill or courage to do it. 
To join two swarms from different hives, it will be 
necessary to drench both with a mixture of beer, sugar, 
and water, made lukewarm, or, with the fumigating bel- 
lows, give them a little smoke fi'om lime leaves or to- 
bacco. When a second swarm is to be returned to the 
parent hive, turn down a chair, and place the back paral- 
lel with the entrance of the hive, over which a sheet or 
tablecloth may be spread ; then holding the hive contain- 
ing the second swarm over it, give it a few sharp knocks 
on the top, and the bees will fall immediately on the 
cloth ; proceed then, either with the finger or a stick, to 
guide a few of the bees to the entrance of the parent 
•hive, and they will instantly crowd into it : those who 

2 L 



5S0 B££S. 

are acqaunted with the penoA of theqaeen, ahovld take 
thk opportmuty of catdiii^ ker. In regard to a tkad 
Bwarm, it woald be folly to keep it. When the weatlMr 
]M«Yes anfiivoiirable after the hiving of a awann, wat 
food ahonld be administered to the beea at night. When 
they lie om in dasten^ and no more awanns are deaind, 
an eek thoold be placed on the hive. If the heat be vciy 
gieaty it wonld be admdile to shade the hives, inadditiaa 
to the eommon coyering of straw, with which they oaght 
always to be provided, as the best pntfection. from the 
eold in winter, and the heat in siunmeE;. A particakr 
value should always be put on those hives that kill thor 
drones the earliest. It sometimes happesa that their nan- 
bers deter the bees firom attempting any violence agHMt 
them ; therefiHe, when the other stocks kill their dnasii 
let the bee-master place himself quietly by the side of the 
hive, in the middle of a fine day, and crush every drane 
with his finger or a stick, as it passes oat or in. £vic]r 
hive will be the better for a little assistance in this mtm 
sacre, which may be looked for in the end of July or be> 
ginning of August. 

Instead of following the general plan of suffocatiDg the 
bees in August, the hives should be removed to the ^ 
cinity of a heath, and there allowed to remain from fov 
to six weeks. July is the best season for depriving the 
hives of a part of their store. When a hive is to be rolh 
bed of its honey, remove it from the stool to some dis- 
tance, procure an empty hive, invert it on that from whicb 
you wish to dislodge the bees, either to take the honeyt 
or to unite them with another hive. Stop up the entrance, 
and then strike gently Uie under hive on the side oppo- 
site to that to which the combs are fixed ; in a few minntesi 
when the anp:er of tlie bees may be appeased, a piece of 
wood should be introduced to keep the two hives aboat 
an inch apart on one side ; for the purpose of prevenUDg 
the bees, after being driven up on the one side, descend^ 
inp^, which they migJit do, by tL3 other, to the hive fro* 
whence they were dislodged, the knocking on tlie niM^r 
hive must bv^ contmued^ till the bees, terrified by the noisei

take refuge is the upper hive; theo, with the famigating 
MlowB, or oonniKm tobacco pipe, blow into the hive a 
Iktke smoke from lime leaves, or tobacco. The same 
'^fperatiov having beoi performed on the other hive, thiit 
is, iht hive destined to receive the new eokmy, the dis- 
lodged bees are emptied into it, and swept with a brush 
of Isathers into the interstices between the combs ; the 
iMwrd beii^ then put npon the hive, it is instantly revert- 
ed, and placed upon the stand. When a hive is Hierely 
to be deprived of a part of its store, the hive with the 
bees in it smy be placed upon the pedestal from which 
the fall one was removed, and the hive from which the 
bees have been driven must then be taken into the house. 
A few bees will be found still straggling about the combs, 
but they will be too frighbened to use their sting. When 
iIm requisite quantity of comb is cut out, breaking it as 
Jittle as possible, the hive should be cleared of every 
■ Bogdotts matter, and returned to its former position ; but 
'first invert the hive containing the bees, and place the 
deprived' hive over it ; leave them in this situation till the- 
momfflg, when the bees will be found to have taken pos- 
session of their native home. At any season of the year, 
a weak hive may be strengthened from a strong one, by 
the following method : Take a strong hive from its pe- 
destal, and place on it that which has few bees in it ; then 
tiH*ning up the strong one, give it several raps on its sides, 
when many of the bees will fly to their old station ; then 
place the str(mg hive where the weak one stood, or the 
other at a considerable distance. 

The bee-master, in approaching a hive, should avoid 

breathing on the bees ; and, if his manner be soft, calm, 

'Sad gentle, he will in general need no protection from 

being stung ; but when swarms are to be united, or hives 

deprived of a part of their store, the operator should be 

•provided with thick worsted gloves, and a gauze, or piece 

.of thin cloth, such as milk is usually strained through, 

for the head ; this last must be large enough to go over 

a man's hat, and round the neck, so as to tie before with 

m string running through a tape or loop holes ; that part 



532 BiSEs. 

which comes next the face must be cat out, and a pieee 
of very open gauze, catgat, or net-work, sewed thenno. 
So protected, the most timid may- proceed fearlessly; 
but every one who undertakes the management of toe 
bee, is more or less subject to its sting. No time shovld 
be lost in extracting it. Rah the wound briskly with a 
piece of woollen cloth till it ceases to smart, and ^>plj 
goulard-water, laudanum, or vinegar and spirits, as may 
be soonest attained ; or wash with spirit of anunonia, and 
wrap a piece of linen about the part, steeped in spirits of 
wine. If the pain continue spc hours, put on a hot pool- 
tice of bread and milk, and change it every fom- houn.

The Huish Hive 

Is made of straw, in the form of a flower-pot inverted, 
but open at both ends, and having a band of straw pro- 
jecting from the inside about two inches from the top; 
upon this band are placed seven bars of well-seasoned 
wood, about one and a half inch broad, and a quarter oi 
an inch thick ; they are slightly fastened down with small 
nails, then covered with thin gauze or net- work, and agaii 
with a circulai* board, in which small holes are made, t»

ons store, remove the top and other coverings, and take 
the side bars out, from which having cut the honey-comby 
replace them as before; the operation is facilitated by 
having some vacant bars ready to supply the places of 
the ful] ones. When the bees, by lying out in clusters^ 
indicate that they stand in need of room, instead of an 
addition at the bottom, as in the common hive, this hive 
need only be deprived of a part of the comb attached to 
one or more of the bars. In time of snow, or when rob- 
bery is threatened, the centre should be closed by a tin 
wicket, or by a piece of lead with holes made in it to ad« 
mit air. 

Another Hive. 

The hive is formed as the common cottage-hive, be* 
ing made to separate towards the middle. On the lower 
division, which may be made the largest, a board is pla- 
ced, in which one large or some smaller holes are made, 
to admit of the bees ascending. When the upper part, 
or top, is filled with honey, it may be removed, and re- 
placed by another prepared for the purpose. Those who 
wish to see the bees at work, may place a glass top under 
the straw one, or invert tumblers, or long glasses made 
for the purpose, over each hole, one or more of which 
may be removed as they are filled. 

To extract the Honey from the Combs. 

To obtain the primary honey, heat, celerity, and clean- 
iness, are necessary. Where a few hives only are kept, 
it will be sufficient to have two or three earthen pans, 
with a frame of wire adapted to their size, each wire be- 
ing about one inch distant from another — a com riddle or 
flour sieve placed over a tub answers the purpose v«ry 
well — ^two horse-hair sieves, a bag of a coniod form, that 
18, wide at top, and tapering to a point at the bottom, 
made of such canvass as is used in a dairy, and some jars 
for the reception of the honey, and in which it is to be 
preserved. The hives should be brought into a warm 
Toom^ where no bees nor wasps can enter ; the combs are 



MM BSBS. 

dken looeeoed from the hive by a long iIub 
parts of the comb which are empty ahonld be a 
irst, and those ^at are blaek and dr o a s y dndm 
^mselves ; as also those in which there is any I 
Shoald there be any brood, care must be taken n 
«msh it, as the jnice will commnnicate a bad flare 
the honey ; and those pieces of the comb wMcb ec 
it, may be placed nnder any sUx^ that moat ^ 
strengthening. If there be any bees npon ^e c 
when taken oat, they should be brasbed or blow] 
and if besmeared with honey, washed in water m 
little warm ; then being laid on a sieve, and placed i 
sonshine, they will revive, and fly to their respc 
homes. The pure combs should be cut in small p 
sliced twice in a horizontal direction, that is, at ^ 
and at the bottom, and laid on the wire frames to d 
m two or three hours they may be turned. When a 
primary honey is extracted, it must be ran throng 
beg, whereby it will be entirely freed from every pa 
of wax. This, the first drawn, should be preserve 
itself; the next in value is that which drains froE 
combs indiscriminately ; a third soil may be obtaini 
wringing the combs in a cloth, or by placing- them 
Inkewarm oven. They may be afterwards steepe 
mead or vinegar, and the water in which the ntensil 
the hands of the operator have been washed^ may be 
likewise for the same purpose. As soon as the ji 
which the honey is to be preserved are full, they si 
be corked down, and deposited in a dry place. L 
honey should never be put into a vessel containing 1 
which has acquired any consistency ; this mixture 
make it ferment and turn sour. A hundred poos 
honey-comb will not in general yield more than 
pounds of wax. 

To Melt and Purify Wax. 

Where six or eight stocks of bees are kept, it wi 
most profitable and convenient to have a tin vessel i 
to fit a due i^To^ot\\Qni^^VftU\& or ^ot, the sides of v 



BJESS. 5Mr 

should be quite fitrugkt, so that, when it sUcLm dowD» 
there may be no vacancy for the farina or bee-bread to 
rise lip between* The holes in the tin separator should 
be as numerous and small as possible in the bottom, smd 
about two inches up the sides; the bottom should be 
quite flat, without a rim, like that of a quart tin pot, that 
it may press the dregs the closer down when near the 
hottom. Set the pot on the Are, with about &ve or six 
inches' depth of water therein, in which is to be mixed 
single aquafortis, in the proportion of half an ounce for 
each quart of water. In this put as many combs as will 
conveniently boil, when melted. As soon as they begin 
to melt, they should be frequently stirred, until a]! be 
thoroughly melted ; let it then boil without stirriug, that 
the wax may rise clear. It should be made to boU 
briskly duriug the whole process. As soon as the yel- 
low froth rises, put in the separater^ and press it down in 
the liquor, until it be about full ; with a wooden spoon, 
or what is better, a tin ladle, flrst dipped in cold water, 
lightly skim off the wax as it rises upon the surface, and 
put it in a narrow-bottomed pan, previously rinsed in 
cold water, set as near as may be to the pot on the fire, 
and continue skimmiug the wax off as long as it rises, 
depressing the separater in proportion as the liquor rises. 
When the liquor in the pan is nearly cold, the wax is to 
be taken out, and what dross adheres to it scraped off* 
The wax is then to be rebelled in a small quantity of 
water, and about a fourth part as much aquafortis as be- 
fore to a quart ; as soon as it boils, take it off, and let it 
stand until cold. The wax will concrete at the top, and 
the remaining dross, being scraped off, may be further 
purified with other combs. 

Another and less expensive method is, to put the 
combs loosely into a canvass, or rather a fine hair bag, 
tied up close at the end, and put into a kettle, with a 
due proportion of aquafortis and water ; a leaden or iron 
weight is to be laid on the bag, to keep it down to the 
bottom. It must be made to boil, so as to throw up the 
froth briskly, which is to be taken off with a ladle ; a 



dB6 BEES. 

tbidc board with a handle in the middle is then to be put 
in, to press out what wax may be still adhering ; it is 
afterwards to be re-melted, as in the first method. It 
should be carefully observed, that in these processes of 
skimming off the froth, what rises of a clear yeUow should 
be reserved by itself, as often requiring no fxirther puii- 
fieation. The more forcibly the froth is thrown up, the 
purer it will be, and the operation the sooner finished. 
The very old brood combs are n^ worth melting ; bat 
such refuse as has been pressed, may be kept in a dose 
tub or vessel for five or six weeks, in which time the im- 
purities will ferment and decay, and the wax will be in a 
better state for melting.

From the different varieties having become so much 
intermixed and blended together^ (this is especially the 
ease in Scotland^^ it is difficult to describe any partica- 
lak* breed of swme. The Berkshire is allowed to be a 
good kind. They are generally of a brown, or rather a 
reddish colour, with black spots, the ears bending for- 
ward^ but not hanging down so much as those of the 
large Cumberland kind; — ^they are short-legged and 
small-boned ; their flesh is fine ; and they are well dis- 
posed to fatten on common fare. — The large spotted Wo- 
bum breed is well formed, prolific, hardy^ and kindly 
disposed to fatten. — The Chinese black, or pot-bellied 
breed, are small in size, their necks thick,, and legs short 
They are one of the most profitable sorts in this iskod, 
as their flesh is delicate, and they Batten on very iodife- 
ent food, and more readily than any other small breed; 
indeed they may be said to be always ready for kiUi^^ 
They are excellent for bacon, and are well <w^yptffd it 
hang used as pork. When young, that is, when thtM 
four months old, they are very mischievous when aol 
well ringed.^ And for those who do not like very fiit 
pork^ the small breeds before mentioned will be prefer* 
able, their flesh being equally delicate.^ — There is another 
small breed, which is by far the best for the fanner, bit 
it cannot be classified ; they will feed in a shorter poiod^ 
and will thrive upon articles that would starve the larger* 
sized animals. The kind in view will feed npcm common 
fare, to seven or eight stones Amsterdam, when deveo 
or twelve months old, or to nine or ten stones when put 
up in the house to receive better food. 

For a large establishment, a boar and two good sows, 
of a proper age, should constantly be kept; and one 
young sow annually reared, in order to supply the odiei% 
when they pass maturity, that is, when they arrive at 



* The usual method of licging swine is now superseded by an 
improved method adopted hy 3Ir Tubb, which is to pare off, wfch 
a sharp penknife, the gristle on tHe tops of the noses of yosBg: 
pigs. 



B£o«. 589': 

three yean ef «ge. Their time <»f farrowing alKmld be 
so arranged that they may produce two litters in th« 
year ; one about March, and the other towards the heffiBm 
mag of Augost. A sow, when with young, ought not t»- 
be entirely confined to a but, but allowed to walk about 
8$ pleasure in the swine-yard, or court belonging to the 
fmrm ; nor should she be allowed to sleep with a num* 
ber of swine. A sow goes with young 112 days, or ax* 
teen weeks, not above a day over or under that time ; a 
few hours prerious to her ferrowing, she will be obser-^ 
▼ad carrying straws in her mouth, to make a bed with* 
When she is bringing forth her young, she ought not to 
hare much litter or long straw in her apartment, nor for 
a few days after, lest the young pigs should be hid by it 
from their dam. She ought to be well fed when giving 
sock ; if she is once allowed to get poor, it will take 
double the quantity of food and of time to restore her to 
ber former state. If the pigs should be numerous, they, 
as also the sow, should be fed two or three times a«day 
with milk, and wheat bran, or meal. Should the milk be 
scarce, a little water, slightly warm, may be mixed with 
it^ taking care that the mixture be not too thick, that is^ 
ipore of the nature of a drink than of any thing else ; and 
while the pigs are feeding on this, the sow should be 
turned out for an hour or two, that her milk may gather 
a* little. She and her pigs should lie dry and wanvu If 
they are well fed, the pigs will be ready for the egit va • 
three weeks ; and may be sold in six weeks. When the 
pigs are taken from the sow and weaned, whether with 
the breeder or purchaser, they must be regularly fed three 
times a*day with a little wheat bran, barley dust, or meat 
of some description or other, mixed with water, made 
milk-warm ; in a few weeks after, they may hare some 
potatoes^ turnips, or any kind of grain; and after the 
Wrest is concluded, they may be allowed to range at 
large among the fields, to pick up any left oom^ beans, or 
peas. Before going out in the morning, they may reoeiTe 
a feeding of oSil grain ; and in the evening, an ^lowance 
of yams or turnips. They may also get the refuse from 



540 WGS. 

the garden, kitchen, and dairy; milk and wbey is the 
finest of all fattening:. When the pigs are put up to close 
feeding, they should have three meals a-day of potatoes, 
irhich have heen strained, mixed with barley or any other 
meal, moistened with milk, whey, or water, and seasoned 
with a little salt ; it should be given regularly, and only 
in such quantities as will be consumed with a relish. This 
will be tbund the best and most economical food ; bat 
where the trouble attending the preparation of it is coiu 
sidered too great, the next best method is to mix oats 
with barley, in the proportion of one part to four of hu- 
ley, which will prevent the pigs from eating it too quick- 
ly ; the oats being husky, require a longer time to be 
chewed. Buck-wheat is a quick and good fattening, 
somewhat similar to barley, not so good as peas; bvt 
peas are sometimes put amongst buck^ for the same pu^ 
pose that oats are mixed with barley. Pigs that are fed 
from the refuse of breweries are liable to eruptive dis- 
eases. Whenever grains are used for feeding, they should 
be fresh, and given in moderate quantities, and should 
only form a part of their diet ; they will also feed well 
on the spent hops of the breweries. Sweet whey, unless 
given in very moderate quantities, is injurious to pigs ; 
but when it becomes sourish, it proves very wholesome 
food. It is too general a practice to pay no attention to 
feeding pigs until they are put up, perhaps in November 
or December, when, with a little pains, they might be as 
fat, and weigh nearly as much, at the time they begin to 
feed, as at the period when they are fed, which may be 
about four or five weeks after they are put up. For 
pork, they are usually fattened from six to nine months 
old ; for bacon and hams, from nine months to a year and 
a half. 

Pigs are subject to inflammatory and eruptive dis- 
eases, both of which require bleeding, purgatives, and 
cool airi n an open field. The most easy way of bleed- 
ng pigs is by cutting off the tail, or part of the ear. 

Purgative powder for pigs, jalap one drachm. Should 
this be found t\suficvcAfcv\\> e\cv^w or twelve grains of 



PIGS. 541 



» 



acamony may be add^d, or ten grains of calomel ; but it 
, ia better to try the jalap alone first. 

When pigs are to be made into bacon hams, they 
should be allowed to fast twenty-four hours before the 
time of killing, and in killing them great attention ought 
to be had to prevent the knife from striking against the 
bone at the bottom of the gullet, by which a morbid state 
. of the flesh in the fore-quarter will be avoided. After 
the pi^ has been killed and dressed, it should hang up 
till the next day^ when it must be sawn down the back 
bone from the tail to the point of the snout; then all 
the seam or tallow should be removed, with the feet, tail, 
and ears, and such trifling pieces as may appear offen- 
sive to the eye. The side being laid upon a table, with 
the skin side uppermost, salt should be taken in indefi- 
nite quantities, and rubbed in well, particularly upon 
the shoulders and hams, £or at least half an hour; the 
side weighing about six stones. In turning the side, 
four ounces of saltpetre, ground very fine, should be 
sprinkled very uniformly over the inside and ends of the 
shanks, above which ought to be laid a covering of salt, 
about an inch thick, over the whole inside, and gently 
clapped down by the hand into every crevice, but by 
no means rubbed in on that side The side may then be 
placed upon boards, on a floor where no frost can affect 
it. If more than one side is cured, they may be laid one 
above another to any depth, provided the back and belly 
parts be laid alternately and the skin side always down- 
most. The whole should be covered with a cloth, and 
some, though not a very heavy weight, put upon the top. 

After lying in this state for ten days, they are to be 
taken up, and rubbed again upon the skin side with salt^ 
for about a quarter of an hour, and covering again the 
inside with salt, without rubbing, and without any more 
saltpetre. After the second rubbing, the sides are again 
put into their former position, and allowed to remain 
there for other ten days, when they may be taken up, 
and wholly covered over with barleymeal, and hung up 
with cords by the shanks, which may be pierced with
