PREFACE 

Recipes designed for small families are rare, and yet there 
are thousands of wives in our cities who cook for only two. 
It follows that they must either cut down large recipes found 
in the ordinary cook book, which can rarely be done success- 
fully, or they must cook the full amount with resulting 
waste. During my experience of keeping house in a flat for 
my husband and myself, I have tried to cook with economy 
with the help of my large cook book, and I have both wasted 
and experimented much and have gradually compiled for my 
own use a book of proved recipes, many of whicfi have been 
given me by friends who have compounded and proved them. 
I now publish the book, believing that it will fill a long felt 
need. It has been my aim in preparing the book to have it 
contain rules for making many dainty and delicious dishes not 
often found in cook books. 




What shall 1 have for dinner? 

What shall I have for tea? 
An omelet, a chop or two, 

Or a savory fricassee? 



Dear! how I wish that Nature 

When she made her mighty plan 

Hadn't given the task to woman 
To care for hungry man. 

Anon. 



SOUPS 



SOUPS 



Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated 
to the boiling point. It should never be left in the pot, but 
should be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to 
get cold. Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour 
very quickly. 

Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the 
top. If this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly 
be spoiled. 

Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used 
for thin soups or broth. 

The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve 
cold thus : Take out all the bones, season with pepper and 
salt, and catsup, if liked, then chop it small, tie it in a cloth, 
and lay it between two plates, with a weight on the upper 
one ; slice it thin for luncheon or supper ; or make sandwiches 
of it ; or make a hash for breakfast ; or make it into balls, with 
the addition of a little wheat flour and an egg, and serve them 
fried in fat, or boil in the soup. 

An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by 
sticking some cloves into the meat used for making stock ; 
a few slices of onions fried very brown in butter are nice ; 
also flour browned by simply putting it into a saucepan over 
the fire and stirring it constantly until it is a dark brown. 



8 SOUPS 

Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened 
soups about the consistency of cream. When coups and gra- 
vies are kept from day to day in hot weather, they should be 
warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded pans or tu- 
reens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate weather, every 
other day may be sufficient. 

EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP. 

To half a pint of milk put two well-beaten eggs, and as 
much wheat flour as will make a smooth, rather thick batter 
free from lumps ; drop this batter, a tablespoonful at a time, 
into boiling soup. 

SHRIMP BISQUE. 

Stir one heaping tablespoonful of flour with enough milk 
or cream to make a paste ; put into the sauce pan one-half pint 
of milk good measure ; the yolk of one egg well beaten ; 
tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste ; add one-half 
cup chopped shrimps the last thing. Serve hot. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP. 

One-half pint of canned tomatoes, one-half pint of milk, 
one heaping teaspoonful of butter, quarter teaspoonful of 
soda. Cook tomatoes a few minutes and then strain them, 
put on the stove again, adding the butter, salt and pepper, and 
a little of the soda, and thicken with flour until quite thick; 
heat the milk separately in a double boiler until boiling hot ; 
When time to serve, add the remainder of the soda to the to- 
matoes and a little minced parsley. Lastly add the boiling 
milk. Serve in heated soup bowls. 



SOUPS 9 

CREAM OF CELERY. 

Cut the outside stalks of a bunch of celery in small pieces ; 
boil until tender, keeping covered with water; when boiled 
tender rub through a gravy strainer; add one pint and one- 
quarter of milk, teaspoonful of butter, salt, and stir in slowly 
a little flour paste ; let boil a little and serve hot. 

WINTER VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Scrape and slice one small turnip, and one carrot, and peel 
one small onion and fry all with a little butter until a light 
yellow; add three stalks of celery, two of leeks, cut into small 
pieces ; stir and fry all for five minutes ; when fried, add two 
stalks of parsley minced, one clove, salt and pepper and a 
little grated nutmeg; cover with three pints of boiling water, 
and simmer for one hour. Take off the scum, strain and 
serve. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

One pint of oysters, one-half pint of milk, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of butter, one-half teacupful of boiling water ; salt 
and pepper. Strain all the liquor from the oysters ; add the 
water and heat. When near the boil, add the seasoning, then 
the oysters. Cook about five minutes from the time they be- 
gin to simmer, until they ruffle. Stir in the butter, cook one 
minute, and pour into the tureen. Stir in boiling milk and 
send to table hot. 

CLAM SOUP. 

One dozen clams chopped fine. Put over the fire the liquor 
that was drained from them, one cupful of water, add the 



10 SOUPS 

clams and boil twenty-five minutes. Then season to taste with 
salt and pepper and a teaspoonful of butter; boil up again and 
pour in one pint of boiling milk. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
flour made to a cream with a little cold milk, or one cracker 
rolled fine. Serve hot in a heated tureen. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Put into a kettle the neck, lower parts of the legs, and thf 
wing tips of a large fat fowl. Dredge with flour, and add a 
pint of cold watei. After letting it soak three-quarters of an 
hour, simmer slowly, keeping the kettle closely covered and 
let the meat drop from the bones. Strain and put the broth 
back on the stove, adding a cupful more of water to the bones 
and cook a good half hour longer. Add this liquor to the 
broth. (There should be a pint of the broth.) Season with 
salt and pepper, and a little minced parsley, according to 
taste. Serve with tiny squares of toasted bread browned in the 
oven. The remainder of the chicken can be used for fricassee. 

STOCK. 

Get a five cent beef bone, and boil two hours with plenty 
of water. This will make a pint of soup stock. Boil this 
stock with chopped carrots, parsnips, potatoes and onions, if 
vegetable soup is wanted, or flavor with strained, canned to- 
matoes if tomato soup is wanted, or use clear as bouillon. 
A half teaspoonful of extract of beef improves the color and 
adds richness to the flavor of the bouillon. 

RICE BALLS. 

Rice balls make a pretty company garnish for soup to be 
used instead of plain rice. Mash or stir down with a fork a 



SOUPS 1 1 

cupful of cold boiled rice, and mix with a batter made of one 
whole egg beaten, a tablespoonful of flour, with a seasoning 
of salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Stir smooth and make 
into balls not larger than a small marble. These are dropped 
into the soup just before it is sent to the table. 

BEAN SOUP. 

One cupful of beans, one quart of water, ham bone, one 
pint of milk, one-half teaspoonful of butter. Boil the beans 
fifteen minutes. Boil with the ham bone three hours. Rub 
through a gravy strainer, add hot milk until it is of the proper 
consistency, and add the butter. Serve at once. 

CLAM-CELERY SOUP. 

Ten clams chopped, one pint water, one pint milk, one 
tablespoonful butter, yolks of two eggs beaten, one-half single 
head of celery, chopped fine, and one very small onion, 
chopped fine, salt and pepper to taste. Rub butter and flour 
together, thickening the hot water with it. When cooked 
smooth, add celery and onion, cooking twenty minutes. If 
clams are fresh, add them, too, but if canned, only heat 
through. Just before serving, add milk, which has been heat- 
ing in another dish, the yolks of eggs and seasoning, not allow- 
ing to cook. 

CREAM OF FISH SOUP. 

Rid cold cooked fish (fresh), of any kind of bones, fat and 
skin, and mince fine ; season to taste. For each cupful of this 
allow two cupfuls of boiling water, in which a sliced onion has 
been boiled, and set over the fire to cook. Heat in another 
saucepan a cup of milk (not forgetting the pinch of soda). 



12 SOUPS 

When boiling stir into it a tablespoonful of butter, rubbed 
smooth with a teaspoonful of flour. Add half a cupful of 
bread dust, already soaked soft in the same quantity of cold 
milk. Beat well together over the fire with a raw egg 
whipped light, pour into a tureen, turn in upon it, stirring 
all the while, the boiling fish and water. As soon as it is 
thoroughly mixed send to the table. 

CORN SOUP. 

Half a can of cornlet, one teaspoonful of chopped onion, 
half a pint of water, one heaping tablespoonful of flour, one 
pint of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one pinch of white pepper, yolk of one egg. Cook the 
cornlet with cold water fifteen minutes ; cook the onion in 
the melted butter until a light brown, add flour, seasoning, 
and the milk gradually, then add the cornlet. Strain and re- 
peat. Beat the yolk of one egg, and put it in the soup tureen, 
pour the soup slowly over the egg, mix well, and serve im- 
mediately. The egg may be omitted. Corn may be chopped 
fine and used instead of cornlet. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Half a pint or half a can of peas, one pint of water, one 
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, a pinch of 
salt, a pinch of white pepper, half a teaspoonful of sugar, half 
a pint of milk or cream. Wash the peas and cook them in one 
pint of boiling water until soft, mash them with the water in 
which they were cooked, strain, and add the remainder of the 
liquid. Make a white sauce and cook until it is like thick 
cream. If the peas are fresh some of the pods may be cooked 
with them. 



SOUPS 13 

SPLIT PEA SOUP. 

Half a cupful of split peas, one and one-half quarts of 
water, one tablespoonful of chopped onion, one heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a pinch of pepper, one and one-half cupfuls of 
milk. Wash the peas and soak them over night in one pint of 
cold water. In the morning drain and rinse thoroughly, add 
quart and a half of cold water and the chopped onion. Cook 
slowly until soft, rub through a strainer. Make a white sauce, 
add this liquid to it and cook until it is of the proper consis- 
tency. Cooking a small ham bone with the peas improves the 
flavor.

FISH. 



In selecting fish, choose those only in which the eye is full 
and prominent, the flesh firm and thick, the scales bright and 
stiff. Fish should be cleaned thoroughly before cooking. 



COOKING IN DEEP FAT. 
GENERAL RULES. 

The fat used for cooking may be olive oil, cottonseed oil, 
cottolene, beef drippings, lard, or a mixture of several fats. 

The food must be covered with crumbs and egg, or a 
batter, to keep it from absorbing fat. 

Place the articles to be cooked in a bath of fat, deep enough 
to float them. The kettle should be of iron ; a frying basket 
ma}' be used. 

Foods already cooked or needing little cooking, require a 
higher temperature than batters. The temperature of the fat 
for oysters, croquettes, fish-balls, etc.. may be tested by 
browning a cube of bread while counting forty. Counting 
sixty while the bread browns gives the right temperature for 
all batters. 



16 FISH 

All the articles cooked must be drained on unglazed brown 
paper. 

When one quantity of food has been taken from the fat, 
it must be reheated and tested before adding a second set. 

In the absence of a frying basket, a wire spoon may be 
used to remove the food from the fat. 

Fat which has been used for frying, should be cooled and 
clarified by cooking a few slices of raw potato in it for ten 
minutes; strain through muslin, and when cold cover. Fat 
may be used several times for frying and then may be made 
into soap. 



CLARIFIED FAT. 

Remove the tough outside skin and lean parts from beef fat 
(cod fat or suet), or pork fat, and cut the fat into small pieces. 
Put it into a saucepan and cover it with cold water. Place 
it on the stove uncovered, so that the steam may carry off the 
impurities. When the water has nearly all evaporated set the 
kettle back and let the fat slowly try out. When the fat is 
still and the scraps of skin are shriveled at the bottom of the 
kettle, strain the fat through a cloth and set it away to cool. 



BAKED SHAD. 

Get a small shad, stuff it with bread crumbs, salt, pepper, 
butter and parsley minced, and mix well with yolk of on* 
small egg, beaten. Fill the fish with this dressing and sew it 
up or fasten a string around. Pour over it a little boiling 
water and some butter, or lay strips of bacon on the fish, and 
bake as you would a fowl. Garnish with parsley and lemon. 



FISH 17 

DRESSING FOR BAKED SHAD. 

Boil up some of the gravy in which the shad was baked ; 
put in a teaspoonful of catsup, a teaspoonful of browned flour 
which has been wet with cold water, juice of half a lemon, and 
half a wineglassful of cherry wine. Serve in a gravy boat 

SHAD ROE. 

Wipe the roe with a bit of cloth until dry ; rub over it 
olive oil or melted butter; boil five minutes until well 
browned. It should be well cooked and of a light brown coloi 
when done ; it is better to put the roe in salted water ; the next 
day boil it as above. Cut it open; dip in flour and frv in hot 
pork fat. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Thoroughly clean the fish; cut off the head or not, as pre- 
ferred. Cut out the backbone from the head to within two 
inches of the tail, and stuff with the following: Soak stale 
bread in water, squeeze dry; cut in pieces a large onion, fry 
in butter, chop fine. Add the bread, two ounces of butter, 
salt, pepper and a little parsley or sage. Heat through, and 
when taken off the fire, add the yolks of two well-beaten eggs ; 
stuff the fish rather full, sew up with fine twine, and wrap 
with several coils of white tape. Rub the fish over slightly 
with butter, just cover the bottom of a baking pan with hot 
water, and place the fish in it, standing back upward, and 
bent in the form of an S. Serve with the following dressing: 
Reduce the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a smooth paste 
with two tablespoonfuls of good salad oil ; stir in half a tea- 
spoonful of English mustard, and add pepper and vinegar to 
taste. 



i8 FISH 

FISH COOKED IN WATER. 

Steam fish over gently boiling water, or place it in a piece 
of muslin, sew or tie the edges together and put the fish into 
boiling water, boil five minutes, then add one tablespoonful 
of salt and cook at a lower temperature until done. Serve 
with a sauce. 

FISH COOKED IN FAT. 

Season with salt and pepper and cover with equal amounts 
of corn meal and flour, or crumbs and egg. Cook in deep fat 
or saute. Drain on paper. 

STUFFING FOR FISH. 

Two cupfuls of bread crumbs, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful of white pepper, cayenne, one tea- 
spoonful onion juice, one teaspoonful chopped parsley, one 
teaspoonful capers or chopped pickle, one-fourth cupful melt- 
ed butter. Mix in the order given. 

FRESH STURGEON STEAK. 

Take one slice of sturgeon two inches thick, let it stand in 
hot water five minutes. Drain, put in a bowl and add a gill of 
vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a saltspoonful of black pepper and the juice of half 
a lemon. Let it stand six hours, turning it occasionally. 
Drain and dry on a napkin, dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs 
and fry, or rather boil, in very hot fat. Beat up the yolks of 
two raw eggs, add a teaspoonful of French mustard, and, by 
degrees, half of the marinade, to make a smooth sauce, which 
serve with the fish. 



FISH 19 

TO BROIL MACKEREL. 

Grease a broiler well ; place the fish over a good fire ; brown 
on both sides ; place on platter and season with a little butter 
and pepper ; or place the fish in a buttered dripping pan, skin 
side down, baking a nice brown ; this may be best in the above 
manner and add a few spoonfuls of rich cream. 

BROILED FRESH MACKEREL. 

When cleaned, wash and wipe dry. Split open, lay on 
buttered gridiron over a clear fire ; sprinkle with salt and when 
brown turn the other side till quite brown. Place on hot 
dish with plenty of melted butter, and one tablespoonful 
cream. Serve immediately. 

BROILED SPANISH MACKEREL. 

Open the fish down the back and remove back bone ; dry 
the fish well with a towel after washing it; salt it, and put on 
a gridrion over a clear fire, turning the flesh side down until it 
is brown, then turn it over; serve with melted butter and 
sliced lemon. 

FINNAN HADDIE BROILED. 

Wash well, soak half an hour in cold water; then for five 
minutes in very hot water. Wipe, rub with butter, and broil 
for fifteen minutes on brisk coals. 

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 
GOOD WITH BOILED FISH. 

Beat one-half teacupful of butter to a cream ; add the yolks 
of two eggs, juice of half a lemon, salt and a very little cay- 



20 FISH 

enne pepper. Put into vessel or a saucepan boiling water. 
Beat with an egg beater until it begins to thicken, then add 
a half-cup of boiling water, beating continually. When of 
consistency of thick custard it is done. It will require five 
or seven minutes to cook, if water boils hard. 

SALMON IN A MOULD. 

One small can of salmon, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, one quarter cupful of bread crumbs, salt and 
pepper, and one sprig of minced parsley. Rub the butter in 
the salmon, put the crumbs in the beaten eggs. Mix all thor- 
oughly and add seasoning. Put into a buttered mould and 
steam one hour. 

Sauce. One-half cupful of hot milk thickened with one 
teaspoonful of corn starch ; add one heaping teaspoonful of 
butter, liquor from the salmon, one egg, one tablespoonful of 
tomato catsup. Put the egg in last and very carefully. 

OYSTERS AND MUSHROOMS. 

Parboil one-half pint of oysters, strain and save the liquor. 
Cut the oysters fine and mix with half a can of chopped 
mushrooms. Mix the oyster liquor and mushroom juice with 
cream enough to make one pint ; thicken with one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and three tablespoonfuls of flour. Season with 
salt, cayenne, and lemon juice. Add the oysters and the 
mushrooms and serve on toast. 

To make icecups for oysters, fill baking powder cans half 
full of water and let them freeze. When you wish to use 
them, turn the frozen mould out on a plate, make a depres- 
sion with a warm poker large enough to hold four or five oys- 
ters. 



FISH 21 

OYSTER COCKTAILS. 

To a glass, six small blue points, two teaspoonfuls of lemon 
juice, one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, two table- 
spoonfuls of catsup, a tiny pinch of salt, and a pinch of sugar. 
Serve cold in a sherbet cup or cocktail glass. 

BAKED SALMON. 

Open a can of salmon, add two well beaten eggs, one-half 
cup milk, four soda crackers broken in small pieces, pepper 
and salt. Pour into buttered granite pan and bake a light 
brown. 

OYSTER PIES. 

For each pie an individual tin pie-plate ; butter and cover 
the bottom with a puff paste, as for pies. Lay on it six select 
oysters, or enough to cover the bottom : drop in bits of but- 
ter and season with a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper; 
spread over this an egg batter and cover with a crust of the 
paste, making small openings in it with a fork. Bake in a 
hot oven until the top is nicely browned. 

OYSTERS STEAMED. 

Wash and drain half a pint of counts; put them in a shal- 
low pan and place in a steamer over boiling water. Steam 
until they are plump with the edges ruffled. Place in a heat- 
ed dish, season with butter, salt and pepper and serve. 

GRANDMOTHER'S SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

A layer of rolled crackers in the bottom of a well buttered 
pudding dish, and a layer of oysters drained ; season with salt, 



22 FISH 

and pepper and bits of butter. Continue this way until the 
dish is full. Then pour over one large cupful of milk. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour. 

LITTLE PIGS IN BLANKETS. 

Roll each nice plump oyster in a very thin slice of bacon ; 
pin with a toothpick ; fry until bacon is brown ; serve on very 
hot dish. 

TURBOT. 

One pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, cooked together; season with salt and pep- 
per, one teaspoonful of onion juice, and one sprig of minced 
parsley. Place in a baking dish a layer of shredded fish and 
the sauce alternately ; sprinkle with bread crumbs and brown 
in a moderate oven. 

EGG SAUCE. 

One cup cream sauce or drawn butter, three hard boiled 
eggs ; chop whites fine and add to sauce ; grate yolks over 
sauce, or the yolks may be chopped by themselves, or rubbed 
through a sieve. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Select large oysters, wash and wipe them, remove pieces of 
shell, season with salt and pepper, roll in fine bread crumbs 
which have been dried, sifted, and seasoned, dip in beaten 
egg and again in crumbs. The egg should have one table- 
spoonful of water or oyster juice added to it. Fry one minute, 
drain, garnish and serve. 



FISH J3 

GRANDMOTHER'S CODFISH BALLS. 

Place a half cupful of the fish in cold water on the back 
of the stove ; when the water is hot pour off, and add more 
cold water until fish is fresh enough. Then pick it up. Boil 
and mash a few potatoes, mix fish and potatoes together while 
potatoes are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third 
fish. Use plenty of butter. Make into balls and fry in plenty 
of hot lard. Be sure to have the lard hot before putting in the 
balls. 

FISH BALLS. 

One-half cupful salt codfish, one and one-quarter cups 
of potatoes, one egg, one-half tablespoonful butter, one-eighth 
teaspoonful pepper. Wash the fish in cold water and break 
into small pieces ; wash and pare the potatoes and cut in 
pieces. Cook the fish and potatoes together in boiling water 
until the potatoes are soft, drain and shake over the fire 
until dry; mash with a wire potato masher, add the beaten 
egg, butter and pepper, add more salt if needed and beat 
until light. Take up the moisture by spoonfuls, mould slight- 
ly, and slip them into the fat. Fry one minute, or until 
brown. 

TO FRY FISH. 

Clean the fish, wipe dry, rub a little salt inside and sprinkle 
with a little pepper after putting them in the pan, but never 
roll them in the flour ; it is not necessary and does not improve 
them. Never allow fish to soak in the fat. The fat should be 
perfectly hot when the fish is put in and kept at the same tem- 
perature throughout the cooking. Fish may be fried in lard, 
butter or clarified dripping, but I prefer the latter, or, what 



24 FISH 

is better, the fat obtained by frying thin slices of salt pork, the 
quantity required depending upon the size and number of the 
fish, but a generous quantity is desirable. If a piece of bread 
dropped into the fat will instantly brown, it will be hot enough 
to put the fish in. All small fish are better fried. 

TRIPE LYONS FASHION. 

Cut one pound of cold cooked tripe into thin slices about 
an inch square and wipe very dry. Mince two onions and 
put them with three ounces of butter in a frying pan and 
brown slowly ; when about half done put in the tripe and let 
fry for ten minutes ; season with salt and pepper and three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Serve very hot. Oysters may be 
added to this dish ; cooking them only long enough to plump 
them. 

SHRED CODFISH. 

Flake very fine a* half pound of very white, sweet codfish. 
Wash in two waters and squeeze as tight as possible. Put 
into a saucepan with a piece of butter as large as an egg, and 
two heaping spoonfuls sifted flour. Mix the butter, flour and 
fish thoroughly together, add very slowly two or three cupfuls 
boiling water, let come to a boil and serve. Add, if you 
choose, just before removing from the stove, an egg well 
beaten. A garnish of hard-boiled eggs is considered an im- 
provement by some. 

BROILED MACKEREL (FRESH). 

Remove head and the dark skin from inside the fish, wash 
thoroughly and wipe dry. Butter the bars of the gridiron 
and broil the fish over a clear fire. When done, dip quickly 



FISH. 



2 5 



into hot water, and serve with a dressing made as for broiled 
salt mackerel. Slit the fish before broiling, so that when laid 
flat the backbone will be in the middle. 

SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH. 

Put a heaping tablespoonful of butter into a half cupful of 
cream, keep it hot, stir often, and when the fish is dished, 
turn the sauce over the fish and serve. 

SAUCE TO SERVE WITH BAKED FISH. 

Put into a double boiler one teaspoonful of butter. Beat 
into it the yolk of one egg, a pinch of salt and cayenne pep- 
per, two tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and one teaspoonful 
of cider vinegar. Cook and stir until it is a little thick and 
add three drops of lemon juice. Keep very hot and closely 
covered. Serve a small portion with each plate of fish.

MEATS AXD SAUCES 



MEATS AND SAUCES 



MEATS AND SAUCES. 

In the selection of meat one should make it a point to un- 
derstand how to buy meat. Beef should be smooth, fine 
grained, and a clear bright red, and should feel tender when 
pinched. The best pieces for roasting are the middle ribs 
and sirloin. 

Veal should be firm and dry, fine grained and a pale pink 
color. 

Pork should be young and break on being pinched. If 
the rind is tough and hard it is old. 

In roasting meat allow fifteen minutes to the pound, and 
above all things have the oven hot before putting roast in. 

It is a difficult matter to get roasts small enough for two 
people. An ordinary roast lasts quite too long to be enjoyable 
even though it can be used in various ways ; as sliced cold 
meat ; cut up in squares and warmed in the gravy and called 
"fricassee"; meat pie, croquettes, hash or hash on toast. 

ROAST BEEF. 

Get a rib piece or loin roast of four or five pounds, wipe 
it clean with a clean wet towel, baste it well with suet fat and 



28 MEATS AND SAUCES 

sprinkle with flour ; lay it in pan, set in oven, baste often with 
its own drippings; when partly done sprinkle with salt and 
pepper; let it roast an hour and a quarter in a hot oven. Be 
sure that your oven is good and hot when you set the roast in. 
When done remove the roast to a heated dish, set in warm 
place ; skim all fat from the drippings with a spoon or brown 
paper; add two teaspoonfuls of sifted flour, pepper and salt, 
and a half teacup of boiling water; boil up once and serve in 
gravy boat. 

ROAST BEEF. 

The smallest roast from the rib after it is rolled weighs 
from three to four pounds. Place in a dripping pan with a 
very little water in the bottom. Dredge with flour and put 
in a hot oven and bake according to the rules above, occasion- 
ally basting with the juices from the bottom of the pan, and 
when about half done plentifully salting. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

Get a small pot roast from the rump and brown in an iron 
kettle before pouring water in and cooking. Boil very slow-

from lumps and use to thicken the gravy. 

ROAST VEAL. 

A small roast of veal from the loin is choicest, but a should- 
er roast with a pocket for stuffing is also good. A two pound 
roast can be bought but from three to three and a half pounds 
is the best size. Bake till tender, basting when necessary. 

ROAST LAMB. 

A leg of lamb is too large for a small family unless it is real 
milk lamb, when it should be carefully roasted as it cooks 
quickly. Get a two pound piece of the shoulder of young 
lamb and ask the butcher to fix a pocket for stuffing. This is 
a very delicious roast. 

ROAST SPARE RIB WITH DRESSING.

ready a frying pan with a teaspoonful of lard and one table- 
spoonful of butter and let it get boiling hot, then put in the 
steak and fry a nice brown on both sides. Garnish with pars- 
ley around the edge of the platter and slices of lemon on top 
of the meat.

beans a quarter of pound of salt pork ; score the rind in slices. 
Mix one pint of boiling water with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
one pinch of cayenne pepper, one tablespoonful of molasses. 
Pour this over the beans, set in a moderate oven, and bake for 
four hours, keeping the pot well covered. About an hour be- 
fore the beans are done, remove the cover to brown the top 
and crisp the pork. When done, if beans are just right, 
the juice will show itself when the pot is tilted half way 
up. Serve in a deep dish, the pork on top, garnished with a 
few sprigs of parsley.

boiling, together with a bay leaf, four cloves, six pepper corns, 
a half stick of celery, and a half inch of stick cinnamon. Place 
the meat in a deep platter when it is done, and spread it thin- 
ly with grated horseradish. Strain the liquor remaining in the 
kettle and make a brown sauce to pour over the meat. Dump- 
lings are very nice served with a pot roast. 

LIVER A LA CREME. 

Get one pound of calf's liver. Wash and boil till very 
tender in salted water. Drain and chop fine. Make a cream

pickles. Put these in a small stewpan with half a cup of 
vinegar, one teaspoonful of bread crumbs, a pinch of salt and 
pepper. Boil all together five minutes, then add one gill of

crumbs, small onion. Boil these together ten minutes. Take 
out the onion, season with one tablespoonful butter, salt, 
white pepper, to taste, and a suspicion of nutmeg or mace. 
Serve at once. 

ROAST PORK. 

The loin or chine, also the spareribs, are the best pieces for 
roasting. Rub surface well with salt, sprinkle lightly with 
sage and pepper, dredge with flour, and bake in a hot oven 
for the first twenty minutes, or until delicately browned, after 
which reduce the heat, allowing twenty minutes to each pound 
of meat. Baste often. Roast pork should be thoroughly 
cooked, not at so high a temperature as other meats, and is 
considered more wholesome when served cold. Serve with 
onion sauce, when served hot, and with baked, fried or stewed 
apples. 

SAUSAGE WITH APPLE GARNISH. 

Always buy the best sausages, as pork which is not of the 
best quality is not desirable or healthful. Two grades of 
seasoning are sometimes offered at the same price, one mild 
and the other highly spiced. Try baking instead of frying 



MEATS AND SAUCES 39 

sausage and you will never go back to the top of the stove 
method. Arrange the sausages on a baking sheet, pierce 
each a half dozen times with a steel fork and set in the oven ; 
turn once to brown and when they are done they will be 
cooked evenly and unbroken. While any kind of pork should 
be well done, it should not be cooked until dry as a chip, 
as it is sometimes served. Pile the sausages on a platter in 
log cabin style and garnish with apples which have been 
cut in round slices, cored and pared and cooked in a weak 
syrup until tender but not broken. The sausage needs the 
acid of the apple to counteract its own richness in fat and 
spices, and if more convenient, serve stewed apple with it. 
Do not choke the sausage in a frying pan and then turn the 
apple in to absorb the grease as it cooks, unless the family 
have digestions of wood choppers in midwinter. 

COTTAGE PIE. 

Mince two cupfuls cold meat (any kind will answer), add 
to it one minced onion, one teaspoonful powdered sage and 
salt and pepper to taste. Turn all into a pie dish, add a little 
hot water and cover with a deep layer of mashed potatoes 
beaten light, with cream and seasoning added. A little sweet 
cream added to the meat is an improvement. Spread a little 
soft butter over the potatoes, and bake half an hour.

BEEF A LA BARCELONA.

of boiled rice in the center of the platter, arrange the meat 
around it, strain the sauce, thicken, and pour over it. 

DRIED BEEF A LA CREME.

chopped fine, season with salt, pepper, catsup and Worcester- 
shire sauce to taste, adding a little thick brown sauce. Serve

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Have a bright, clear and steady fire for roasting. Pre- 
pare your chicken. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, onion 
chopped fine, butter, pepper and salt, and one-half cup of 
raisins, if liked. Put a pint of hot water in the dripping-pan, 
add to it a small tablespoonful of salt and a small teaspoonful 
of pepper. Baste frequently and let it roast quickly without 
scorching. When nearly done add a piece of butter the size 
of a large egg to the water in the pan ; when it melts baste 
with it, dredge with flour, baste again and let it finish. From 
three-quarters to one hour will roast if the fire is right. When 
done take it up, let the giblets (heart, liver and gizzard) boil 
tender and chop fine. Put them in the gravy. Add a table- 
spoonful of browned flour and a bit of butter. Stir it over the 
fire for a few minutes, then serve in a gravy tureen. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH OYSTER DRESSING. 

Dress and rub the turkey thoroughly both inside and out

with salt and pepper and stuff with a dressing prepared as 
follows : Take a loaf of stale bread, cut off the crust and 
soften by placing in a pan, pouring on boiling water, draining 
off immediately and covering closely; crumble the bread fine, 
add half a pound of melted butter, or more if to be very rich, 
and a teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, or 
enough to season rather highly ; drain off liquid from a quart 
of oysters, bring to a boil, skim and pour over the bread 
crumbs, adding the soaked crusts and one or two eggs. Mix 
all thoroughly with the hand, and if rather dry moisten with 
a little sweet milk ; lastly, add the oysters, being careful not 
to break them ; or first put in a spoonful of stuffing, and then 
three or four oysters and so on, until the turkey is filled; stuff 
the breast first. Flour a cloth and place over the openings, 
tying it down with a twine ; spread the turkey over with but- 
ter, salt and pepper. Place in a dripping-pan in a well-heated 
oven, add half a pint of hot water, and roast two hours, bast- 
ing often with a little water, butter, salt and pepper, kept in 
a tin for this purpose and placed on the back of the stove. A 
swab made of a stick with a cloth tied on the end is better 
than a spoon to baste with. Turn until nicely browned on all 
sides, and about half an hour before it is done baste with but- 
ter and dredge with a little flour. This will give it a frothy 
appearance. When you dish the turkey, if there is much fat 
in the pan, pour off most of it and add the chopped giblets 
previously cooked until tender, and the water in which they 
were cooked ; now stew down to about one pint ; place one or 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour (it is better to have half 
of it browned) in a pint bowl, mix smooth with a little cream, 
fill up bowl with cream or rich milk, and add to the gravy in 
the pan. Boil several minutes, stirring constantly, and pour 
into the gravy tureen. Serve with currant or apple jelly. A

BONED TURKEY. 

With a sharp knife slit the skin down the back, and, rais- 
ing one side at a time with the fingers, separate the flesh from 
the bones with a knife until the wings and legs are reached. 
Then unjoint from the body, and cutting through to the bone, 
turn back the flesh and remove the bones. When the bones 
are removed the flesh may be reshaped by stuffing. Some 
leave the bones in the legs and wings, as they are the most 
difficult to remove. Stuff with force meat made of cold lamb 
or veal and a little pork chopped fine and seasoned with salt, 
pepper, sage or savory, and the juice of one lemon. Sew into 
shape, turn ends of wings under and press the legs close to the 
back, and tie firmly so that the upper surface may be plump 
and smooth for the carver. Lard with two or three rows on 
the top, and bake until thoroughly done, basting often with 
salt and water and a little butter. Carve across in slices and 
serve with tomato sauce or meat jelly for boned turkey. 

MEAT JELLY FOR BONED TURKEY. 

Take oil from the water (when cold) in which the turkey 
was boiled, strain into a porcelain kettle, add two ounces of 
gelatine, three eggs with shells, a wineglassful of sherry or 
Madeira; stir well. Add one quart of strained liquor, beat 
rapidly with an egg beater, put over the fire and stir till it 
boils ; simmer ten or fifteen minutes, sprinkle with a pinch of 
turmeric and strain as other jelly. Add lemon juice to taste. 
When cold break up and place over and around turkey. Cut 
in thick slices and fanciful shapes with paste cutter.

ROAST DUCK. 

Wash and dry the duck carefully. Make a stuffing of 
bread, onion, pepper, salt and butter; insert, and sew up com- 
pletely that the seasoning may not escape. If tender, ducks 
do not require more than an hour to roast ; keep them well 
basted, and a few minutes before serving dredge lightly with 
flour to make them froth and look plump. Send to the table 
hot, with a good brown gravy poured, not around, but over 
them. Accompany with currant jelly and, if in season, green 
peas. 

ROAST QUAIL. 

Clean the quail, wash them in soda and water. Cleanse

CANDIED SWEET POTATOES. 

Boil sweet potato.. . ..til just done. Peel and lay them in 
a shallow pan. Sprinkle them with brown sugar and bits of 
butter. Put the pan in the oven and let the potatoes slightly 
brown. 

SNOW POTATOES. 

Boil and mash the potatoes. Season with butter, pepper, 
salt and cream. Then run them through the potato ricer. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

One-half cup rice, three-fourths teaspoonful salt ; cook until 
tender and dry. While still lukewarm add to each cup of 
boiled rice one-half egg, a speck of white pepper and a bit of 
butter. Mould and set away to cool. Roll in egg, then in fine 
bread crumbs and fry in deep fat one minute. Make in shape 
of pyramid. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS CREAMED. 

Wash and throw a cupful of sprouts into water. Simmer 
until tender, which takes about three-quarters of an hour. 
Drain off the water and pour over them a cream sauce. 



56 VEGETABLES 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Bake four medium sized potatoes. When done, cut length- 
wise in half, scoop out the inside, mixing it with butter, pep- 
per, salt and two tablespoonfuls of cream ; beat until light, re- 
turn to the shell of the potato. Place them again in the oven 
until ready to serve. 

SPRING VEGETABLES. 

The tender rhubarb which is one of spring's first offer- 
ings, goes very well with roast lamb or any other meat course 
for dinner. It is much more delicious if cooked without water, 
as the stem itself contains plenty of juice. Peel the stalks, 
cut them into pieces an inch long and put them into the upper 
part of a double boiler with sugar. Since it is to be served 
as a vegetable it will not need so much sugar as when used as 
a sauce, a half cupful being sufficient. 

Dandelion greens is usually the first delicacy of the sea- 
son for the women in the country. To avoid bitter taste the 
leaves must be parboiled in hot water and rinsed in cold water 
after each draining. Then they are boiled for fifteen minutes, 
or until tender. Drain them, run cold water over them and 
chop them fine. Just before serving, heat them in a frying 
pan with a little butter, salt and pepper. Send them to the 
table with the top garnished with hard-boiled eggs. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Asparagus is another of the early spring vegetables, and 
to this plant has been ascribed many medicinal qualities. The 
wise housewife never throws away the tough lower ends of 
the stalks, but cuts them up into short lengths, stewing them 



VEGETABLES 



57 



tender, and saves the juice to flavor her next soup. To bake 
the asparagus, cut the tender ends of the stalks into inch-long 
pieces and cook them about fifteen minutes. Drain them and 
save the water in which they are cooked for the soup kettle. 
Arrange the asparagus in alternate layers, in a buttered 
baking dish, with fine bread crumbs, bits of butter, salt and 
pepper and dice-shaped pieces of hard-boiled eggs. Sprinkle 
the top of the dish with buttered crumbs and bake twenty-five 
minutes. Send to the table in a baking dish. 

BAKED CABBAGES. 

Get a small firm white cabbage, clean and boil for fifteen 
minutes, then change the water and add more boiling water. 
When the cabbage is very tender drain and set aside to cool. 
When it is perfectly cold, chop fine and add two well beaten 
eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and 
three tablespoonfuls of cream. Stir all well together, and 
bake in a well buttered pudding dish until brown. Serve 
very hot. This dish is very digestible. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 

Boil tender four parsnips, scrape and slice lengthwise. 
Put in a saucepan, add two teaspoonfuls of butter, salt and 
pepper, and a little minced parsley. Shake until the mixture 
boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce two tablespoonfuls 
of sweet cream in which has been stirred a teaspoonful of 
flour. Let come to a boil and pour over the parsnips. Serve 
hot. 

BOILED ONIONS. 
Select as many onions as required. (The white silver 



58 VEGETABLES 

skins are the best species). Peel off the outside and cut off 
the ends, and put in cold water in a stewpan, and let them 
scald three minutes ; then turn off the water, pour on cold 
water salted a little and boil slowly until tender, which will 
take about thirty minutes or longer, according to size of 
onions. When tender drain and dry. Pour over them a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and serve. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Select four nice onions, boil the same as boiled onions. 
When quite done drain off all the water. Add half teacup- 
ful of milk, butter the size of a large walnut, salt and pepper, 
a heaping teaspoonful of flour stirred to a cream with a little 
milk. Let all boil up once and serve in a vegetable dish. 

BAKED ONIONS. 

One large Spanish onion, wash and clean, but do not peel. 
Put into a saucepan with slightly salted water. Boil forty- 
five minutes, replacing with more boiling water as it evap- 
orates. Pour off water and lay the onion on a cloth to dry. 
Roll onion in a buttered tissue paper, twisting it at the top, 
and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour, or until 
tender all through. When tender, peel and place in a small 
deep dish and brown slightly. Baste with melted butter for ten 
minutes, season with salt and pepper, and pour over onion one 
spoonful of melted butter. 

LIMA AND KIDNEY BEANS. 

One-half pint of beans, put them into boiling, water, a 
little more than enough to cover them, and boil till tender. 



VEGETABLES 59 

Serve with butter and salt upon them, or cream them by 
mixing a teaspoonful of flour with milk till thick, then add a 
little parsley, and stir into the beans, adding a cup of milk. 
This makes a very fine dish. 

BAKED BEETS. 

Wash and clean three or four beets, put into oven and 
bake three-quarters of an hour in a hot oven, turning them 
often with a knife to keep the juice from running out as it 
would if a fork were used. When done, remove the skins and 
serve with butter, salt and pepper on the slices. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Get half a peck of peas, shell them and wash in cold water. 
Put into kettle and pour boiling water over them, just enough 
to cover them. Boil twenty-five minutes, at least till the 
liquor is nearly boiled out ; season with salt and pepper and 
a tablespoonful of butter. Serve very hot. 

STEWED GREEN PEAS. 

The same amount as above, shell and wash ; put into a 
saucepan with boiling water and boil until very tender. Drain 
in a colander. Melt a heaping teaspoonful of butter in one of 
flour; stir well and add to the peas, and boil eight minutes. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Butter the sides of a small pudding-dish, put a layer of 
breadcrumbs in the bottom, on them put a layer of sliced 
tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, adding bits of but- 
ter and a little white sugar sprinkled over. Repeat until the 



60 VEGETABLES 

pan is full, having the top layer of sliced tomatoes with bits 
of butter on each slice. Bake in a closely covered dish till 
thoroughly cooked through. Remove cover and brown quick- 
ly. Serve hot. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Peel and slice four tomatoes a quarter of an inch thick, 
place in layers in a pudding-dish, seasoning each layer with

Cover with a lid, and bake half an hour. Remove the lid 
and brown ten minutes. Just before serving, pour over the 
top three tablespoonfuls of whipped cream with melted butter. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Select four nice, ripe tomatoes, pour boiling water over 
them and let them remain in the boiling water a few min- 
utes; peel off the skins, put in a graniteware saucepan, and 
stew about twenty minutes; add a heaping teaspoonful of 
butter, salt and pepper, letting them stew ten minutes longer. 
Serve hot. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 

Boil a dozen parsnips until tender. Make a drawn butter 
sauce as follows: In a small pan thoroughly mix a table- 
spoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour. Add a 
cupful of hot water and set over hot water until melted. Boil 
up once and pour over parsnips which have been drained. 
Serve very hot. 

GREEN CORN BOILED. 
Select four nice ears of corn. Strip off the husks and re- 



VEGETABLES 61 

move all the silk ; put into boiling water and boil twenty-five 
minutes. Serve on a heated platter covered over with a large 
table napkin. 

GREEN CORN ROASTED. 

Strip off all the husks from the corn and roast on the 
gridiron over a bright fire of coals, turning it as one side is 
done. Serve with salt and butter. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Green corn left over makes a nice lunch dish. Cut the 
corn from the cob. Put into a bowl one-half cupful of corn, 
half cupful of milk, quarter cupful of flour, one small egg, 
pinch of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
well into a thick batter, and fry in small cakes in very hot 
butter. Serve with plenty of butter and powdered sugar. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT. 

Get a very small egg plant, cut in two ; scrape out all the 
inside and put into a saucepan with a little minced ham. 
Cover with water and boil till very tender ; drain off the 
water; add two heaping teaspoonfuls of grated crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of butter, half a small onion minced ; pinch of 
salt and a dash of pepper. Stuff each half to the hull with the 
mixture. Add a small lump of butter to each and bake fifteen 
minutes. Serve hot. 

FRIED RAW POTATOES. 

Peel six good sized potatoes very evenly and cut them in 
slices as thin as an eggshell. Put into a frying pan one tea- 
spoonful of butter and one of lard, and as soon as it boils add 



62 VEGETABLES 

the sliced potatoes, sprinkling them over with salt and pep- 
per. Cover them with a close-fitting lid, letting the steam 
partly cook them. Remove the lid and then fry gold in color, 
shaking and turning them very carefully with a wooden ladle, 
so as to brown equally and not break the slices. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Take four to five good sized cold-boiled potatoes; slice 
endwise and crosswise, making them in small squares. Heat 
a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan ; fry in it half a small 
onion chopped fine, and fried till it changes color, (not a 
brown but a yellow color). Then put in your potatoes, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, stir well with a wooden ladle 
and cook fifteen minutes. Drain dry by shaking in a heated 
colander, taking care not to break them. Serve hot. 

POTATOES A LA MARYLAND. 

Boil four sweet potatoes with their skins on ; peel, cut in 
halves, lay in a shallow tin and cover with sweet cream. Add 
a little salt and a large piece of butter to each slice. Put into 
hot oven and bake a rich brown. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

Boil, peel and slice four sweet potatoes ; put in layers in 
the baking dish, covering each layer with brown sugar and 
pieces of butter. Bake in a moderate oven till a nice brown. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

Brush clean four good sized sweet potatoes. Bake in a 
hot oven a good half hour, or until they are done. When 
thoroughly baked they feel soft and yielding when pressed 
with the fingers. Try them often with a fork while baking. 



VEGETABLES 63 

BEETS. 

Wash and cook whole until tender ; leave two or three 
inches of the top on until they are cooked. Put in cold water, 
pare, slice, reheat, and add seasoning. They may be served 
cold with vinegar. 

CABBAGE AND CAULIFLOWER. 

Cut cabbage into quarters and soak in cold water one-half 
hour. Chop the leaves, and cook in boiling water until tender. 
Drain and serve with butter, salt and pepper, or with a white 
sauce. Cook cauliflower whole and in a bag to keep its shape. 

SPINACH. 

One-half peck spinach ; pick leaves from the stems, and 
wash carefully to remove the sand. Cover and cook until ten- 
der, chop fine or press through a colander ; reheat with two 
tablespoonfuls melted butter and seasoning. Serve garnished 
with two hard cooked eggs. Old spinach should be cooked in 
boiling water. 

STEWED POTATOES. 

Slice very thin a heaping cupful of cold baked potatoes ; 
dredge with a teaspoonful of flour, a pinch of salt, and sprinkle 
with pepper. Put two teaspoonfuls of butter in a saucepan 
with a half cupful of fresh, rich milk, and when hot add the 
potatoes ; stir once, and cook ten minutes without further 
stirring. The slices should lie in the gravy unbroken. 

POTATOES BROWNED. 

Take seven potatoes and mash them the same as mashed 
potatoes. Lay into the dish they are to be served in, smooth 



64 VEGETABLES 

over the top and brush over with the yolk of an egg. Set in 
oven to brown ; it will brown in ten minutes if the oven is hot. 



POTATO PUFFS. 

Prepare four large potatoes the same as mashed potatoes. 
While hot shape into balls the size of an egg. Have a tin 
dish well buttered and place the balls in it. As soon as they 
are done brush over with beaten egg. Brown in oven. When 
done, slip a knife under them, removing to a hot platter, 
bedded with parsley. Serve at once. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Take seven good sized potatoes ; wash and pare, and lay 
them in cold water thirty minutes; then put them into a 
saucepan, cover with water and a large pinch of salt. Boil 
until thoroughly tender. Drain off the water and mash them 
fine. Have ready a piece of butter the size of an English 
walnut melted in a little hot milk and a pinch of salt. Mix 
this well with the mashed potatoes until they are nice and 
smooth, taking care they are not too wet. Heap them up 
in a vegetable dish, smooth over the top, put a small piece of 
butter on top in the center and have dots of pepper here and 
there. Make it a point always to have your dishes hot and 
serve hot. 

CREAMED ASPARAGUS. 

Cut only the very tender part of the stalks into inch pieces; 
boil until tender in as little water as can be used and prevent 
burning; drain off the water, season with salt and pepper; 
pour into the cooking dish a cup of thin cream or sweet milk, 



VEGETABLES 65 

and thicken with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed smooth 
with a tablespoonful of flour; boil up until sauce is smooth, 
and serve. 



CREAM OF SPINACH. 

Wash and clean thoroughly half a peck of fresh spinach. 
Throw it into five quarts of salted boiling water in an un- 
covered saucepan, boil for twenty-five minutes. Drain it on 
a colander ; when cool squeeze all the water out of it. It must 
be cooled quickly by pouring cold water over it, for the tin 
of the colander will spoil it. Chop it as fine as possible, then 
put it in a saucepan with one tablespoonful of butter, cook 
slowly for six minutes till dry, stir often. Sprinkle over it 
one teaspoonful of flour and mix well ; add half a pint of rich 
cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste_, cook again 
slowlv for ten minutes. Remove from fire and add one table- 
spoonful of butter. Serve in a hot vegetable dish and garnish 
with sliced hard boiled eggs. 



CREAMED CABBAGE. 

Chop half of a small cabbage and boil until tender and the 
water is nearly or quite boiled away. Cover with milk, sea- 
son with salt, pepper and butter and serve. 



FRIED CUCUMBERS. 

Pare cucumbers and cut into thick slices; dip into beaten 
egg which has been seasoned with salt and pepper, then roll 
in fine cracker crumbs and fry in frying pan a light brown. 



66 VEGETABLES 

CABBAGE SLAW. 

To one cup of cabbage chopped fine, add this dressing: 
Make a dressing with one egg beaten up well, and three table- 
spoonfuls sugar, a pinch of salt, about half a pint of vinegar, 
all beaten well together, then put on fire and cook till it just 
boils, stirring all the time, as it will curdle if too sour. (Add 
a little water to vinegar.) Cool this well, pour over slaw, 
and serve. 

BUTTERED RICE. 

Throw a cupful of raw rice into two quarts of boiling 
water, slightly salted. Boil fast for twenty minutes, or until 
each grain is softened not broken. Drain in a colander and 
set in open oven to dry while you heat a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in a frying-pan ; drop in a teaspoonful of grated onion, 
stir to a hissing fry. Now turn the dried rice into the hot 
butter, toss lightly for a minute, seasoning to taste with 
pepper and salt, and serve in a deep dish. 

FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Pare and slice, put in salted water ; leave in long enough to 
extract all bitterness ; wipe each piece dry. Dip in beaten egg 
and fine crackers, crumbs or corn meal ; sprinkle with a little 
pepper and fry in hot fat ; serve while hot. 

FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Choose medium-sized egg plants ; slice a quarter of an inch 
thick and let stand for a half-hour in cold, salted water; dry 
on a cloth and dip in egg, then in fine crumbs; dip again in 
egg and crumbs and fry a rich brown. They may be peeled 



VEGETABLES 67 

before frying, or after frying the skin readily peels off. Do 
not remove from the salt water until just as you are ready to 
fry, as they turn black quickly. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape roots carefully; boil in salted water until tender. 
Cut into long slices, dredge with flour and fry quite brown 
in butter and dripping mixed. 

STEWED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape roots and slice across; cook in as little water as 
possible, as the sugar of the vegetable goes into the water and 
is thrown away if much water is drained off ; watch carefully 
to prevent burning, and when the water is cooked away add 
butter, salt, pepper, and milk enough to cover. Thicken with 
a little flour. 

PARSNIP PATS. 

Boil parsnips until tender enough to press through a sieve. 
Season with salt and pepper, add one beaten egg; form into 
small pats and fry a delicate brown. 

CREAMED TURNIPS. 

Cut turnips into small dice ; boil in salted water, drain, 
pour on milk to cover. Thicken with a little flour, moistened 
with milk. Season with butter, salt and pepper. 

CREAMED CARROTS. 

Slice new carrots and boil until tender in salted water; 
use as little water as possible and prevent burning, so that the 



68 VEGETABLES 

sweetness will remain in the vegetable, and not be thrown 
away in the water. Prepare a cream of two tablespoonfuls 
butter rubbed into two tablespoonfuls flour, and one pint of 
boiling milk or thin cream poured over it. Let all boil up 
once with the carrots. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the dish 
just before sending to the table. 

BAKED SQUASH IN THE SHELL. 

Cut hubbard squash into pieces about four inches square ; 
lay in baking pan, pepper and salt each piece, and put a lump 
of butter in the center of each. Bake until tender and serve 
in the shell just as it comes from the oven. 

TO COOK SUMMER SQUASH. 

Cut the squash in pieces and put in a cheesecloth bag; boil 
in salted water until done. Then remove the bag and hang 
up to drain. When it has drained well put in the colander, 
leaving the bag still closed ; with a potato masher press out 
the rest of the juice. Open the bag, turn the squash into a 
basin and mash any remaining lumps. Season with butter, 
pepper and salt, heat, and serve. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Use green peas as soon as possible after picking, as they 
lose their sweetness rapidly. Shell, wash and boil twenty 
minutes, having all the water boil away if possible ; unless the 
peas are very young and tender, it is best to add a teaspoonful 
of sugar to the water in which they are boiled. Season with 
salt, pepper, butter, milk or cream. Heat the milk to the 
boiling point and serve. 



VEGETABLES 69 

CANNED PEAS. 

Drain the peas in a colander and rinse off all the liquor 
with cold water. Put in basin with two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of water, just enough to heat the peas and keep them 
from scorching; when well heated, add a cup of rich milk, but- 
ter, pepper and salt. Let just come to a boil and serve. A 
teaspoonful of sugar added to the peas when boiling is a great 
improvement. A good brand of peas prepared in this way 
will be nearly equal to the fresh vegetable. 

GREEN PEAS WITH NEW POTATOES. 

Cut two thin slices of fat, salt pork into small dice ; fry 
a little in the bottom of kettle in which you are to cook the 
vegetables. Add about a quart of small, new potatoes and a 
pint or more of green peas. Season with salt and pepper ; 
when tender turn off all the water, except about half a cupful. 
Add a cup of milk and thicken with a little flour. 

BEETS. 

Young and tender beets should be chosen. Old beets re- 
quire three or more hours to boil tender. When tender plunge 
for a moment in cold water and the skins will slip off easily. 
Be careful in preparing beets not to cut the skins, as the beets 
bleed and lose their sugar. Slice into dish ; sprinkle each 
layer with salt and pepper. Heat one-half cup water, one-half 
cup vinegar, one tablespoonful sugar and one tablespoonful 
butter, and pour over the sliced beets. 

SPINACH. 

Wash the spinach very carefully through several waters, 
as particles of sand are apt to lodge in the stems near the root. 



70 VEGETABLES 

Cut away the roots before boiling. Boil twenty minutes in as 
little water as can safely be used and not burn. Drain, press 
in the colander to remove all water; chop very fine, season 
with salt, pepper and butter, and garnish with hard-boiled 
eggs. 

DANDELION GREENS. 

Wash the greens very carefully in several waters. Boil 
until tender; one-half hour will be sufficient if the greens are 
young and tender. When done, press them as dry as possible 
in a colander. Season with salt and pepper and a little butter; 
garnish the dish with slices of hard boiled eggs. Serve with 
sliced lemon, as the juice is a more pleasant acid than vinegar. 
Only the very young greens should be used. 

FRIED TOMATOES GREEN OR RIPE. 

Four tomatoes and one cupful of crumbs, one small onion 
chopped fine, salt and pepper. If ripe tomatoes are used, 
choose solid firm ones, not too ripe. Remove skin. If green 
ones, just beginning to ripen, are used, do not pare ; cut a thin 
paring from the end and divide into slices about one-half inch 
thick. Prepare the dressing and press it into the tomatoes 
until all the interstices are filled. Fry in drippings a rich 
brown. Serve in hot platter. 

CAULIFLOWER SERVED WHOLE. 

To cook cauliflower and have it remain unbroken, wash

EGGS 



BOILED EGGS. 

Three minutes boils eggs soft; six minutes boils eggs so 
yolk is not quite set; ten minutes boils eggs hard; twenty 
or thirty minutes boils eggs so yolks are mealy. They are 
said to be more digestible boiled as long as this, but the yolk 
is apt to darken. To have eggs jellied, put them into boiling 
water and then set dish back on range where the water will 
keep hot but not boil. In ten minutes the eggs will be cooked 
through; the whites will be like a jelly, and not hard as in 
boiled eggs. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Fill basin with boiling salted water, if the bottom of the 
basin is greased first, the eggs will not stick to the dish. 
Break each egg into a saucer, and let slide carefully into the 
basin; keep hot but do not boil the water; when a film of 
white comes over the top, remove eggs to a hot dish; put 
piece butter on each egg; sprinkle with pepper. 

SCALLOPED EGGS. 

Four hard boiled eggs, and half a cup of bread crumbs ; 
one-half cup white sauce; slice the eggs in thin rings, cover 



EGGS 75 

the bottom of a buttered baking dish with crumbs, then the 
eggs sprinkled with salt and pepper, cover with sauce and ar- 
range in layers, the same way until the dish is nearly full. 
Cover the top well with crumbs, and brown nicely in a mod- 
erate oven. 

CURRIED EGGS. 

Three hard boiled eggs, two ounces of butter, half of one 
onion and one gill stock, one dessertspoon curry powder, one 
ounce flour, one teaspoonful of cream ; fry onion in butter (an 
apple may be added if desired) then add the flour, stock and 
curry powder ; stir gently until flour is cooked ; then add the 
cream ; cut the eggs in halves and warm half of the pieces in 
the curry; keep the rest for decorating and dish up prettily 
with curry in the center, and a wall of rice around it. A sprig 
or two of parsley and slices of lemon make it look nice. 

SHIRRED EGGS. 

Separate the number of eggs desired, being careful to pre- 
serve each yolk unbroken in part of its shell ; put whites in 
a bowl ; beat stiff after salting sufficiently. Butter as many 
gem pans or shirred egg dishes as there were eggs; dip a 
large spoonful or more of the stiff white into each dish ; drop 
the yolks carefully into the center and bake until the white 
is very lightly browned. A very pretty and dainty way to 
serve eggs. 

CURRIED EGGS. 

Three hard boiled eggs, cut in lengthwise strips; cover 
with the following sauce : one cup of milk and four table- 



76 EGGS 

spoonfuls butter, two tablespoonfuls flour, one-half teaspoon-

and let the sauce reduce for about ten minutes ; when ready 
to serve cut four hard boiled eggs in slices ; mix them in the 
preparation and let heat together, without boiling, for two 
minutes ; add half a teaspoonful of diluted mustard and serve. 

PINK PICKLED EGGS.

spoonful dry mustard. Mix to a smooth paste ; stuff the 
whites with the mixture; press the halves closely together; 
secure with a wooden toothpick, and lay in a bed of lettuce 
leaves. 

STUFFED EGGS. 

Prepare same as preceding recipe with the addition of 
minced ham, tongue, chicken, or other cold meat. Mustard 
may be omitted if desired, and lemon juice substituted for the 
vinegar. Minced sardines or grated cheese may be used the 
same as any variety of meat ; parsley chopped fine, cress, or 
any savory herb may be used for seasoning. Any variety may 
be made with a little practice. 

SCALLOPED EGGS. 

Hard boil six ; slice them in thin rings ; place in the bot- 
tom of a well-buttered baking dish a layer of breadcrumbs, 
then one of eggs. Cover with small bits of butter and sprinkle

is to take round slices of bread, toast them delicately, butter 
them and dip lightly in hot water. On each round spread the 
white of an egg beaten stiff with a speck of salt. Make a de- 
pression in the center, and in each place a whole yolk. Set

MILK BREAD. 

About half past four in the afternoon make a sponge in 
the following way: Pour one and a half cupfuls of boiling 
water on six hops, and when lukewarm, strain and squeeze 
the hops dry. Measure the hop water and add enough more 
water to make one cup and a half. Melt in this hop water 
half a cake of yeast and add three cupfuls of sifted flour. Use 
a three-quart basin ; cover tightly, and set in a warm place 
until eight o'clock, when the sponge should fill the basin about 
two-thirds full. Sift three more cupfuls of flour, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one pinch over, and put into a six-quart 
earthenware vessel. Add one teaspoonful of lard and one 
tablespoonful of sugar, and mix. Then pour in the sponge. 
Rinse out the basin with one cupful and a half of rich milk, 
add this to the flour and mix. Turn on a lightly floured board 
and knead into a soft elastic mass, using a half cupful of flour. 
Put it back into the large basin. Cover tightly and raise all 
night in a. warm place, temperature 70. By half-past six in 
the morning it should quite fill the basin. Turn out and knead 
long enough to form into loaves. Use one teaspoonful flour 
and no more for the last kneading; the dough must be soft 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC 81 

and elastic. Put into pans, cover and raise an hour and a half 
in a temperature of 90. The dough should more than double 
in size. The first ten minutes the oven should be hot enough 
to lightly brown the top ; then moderate a littlel and bake for 
twenty-five minutes, not more than thirty minutes. This 
makes two loaves. Bread should be entirely cold before be- 
ing put away in the bread box. 

BREAD. 

Take half a pint of peeled potatoes cut into small pieces ; 
boil them in one pint of water, skim out the potatoes and 
mash fine. Add two tablespoonfuls of fine flour to the pota- 
toes, pour over the potato water and stir till smooth. When 
cool, add two tablespoonfuls of yeast and a half teaspoonful 
of salt. Let it rise over night. In the morning, take the 
bread bowl filled with flour, pour half a pint of boiling water 
in the center, and mix. Add enough cold water to make luke- 
warm : then pour in the sponge made the night before, mix 
the dough soft and knead one-half hour. Put back into bread- 
bowl and set to rise. When light, knead down and set to rise 
again. Then knead into loaves, put into bread pans and when 
light, bake in a moderate oven. This quantity will make two 
loaves. 

YEAST. 

A double handful of hops in a thin bag, one quart of boil- 
ing water, one quart of potatoes cut into small pieces. Boil 
potatoes with the hops until thoroughly done, keeping them 
covered tightly all the time. Take the potatoes out and mash

USES FOR STALE BREAD 89 



USES FOR STALE BREAD 



Crusts and small pieces of bread should be dried in a cool 
oven until a light brown. Roll them on a pastry board, or put 
through a meat grinder. Crumbs must be sifted. Use them 
only to cover articles of food cooked in deep fat. Crumbs 
should be kept in jars with a piece of muslin tied over them. 

CROUTONS. 
Cut pieces of stale bread into cubes, and brown in the oven. 

SIPPETS. 

Cut bread into pieces two inches thick, cut either round 
or four and a half inches long by three inches wide. Remove 
part of the bread from the center, butter, and brown in oven. 

BREAD PUDDING.

place a layer of stale bread, rolled fine, in the bottom of the 
dish, then a layer of any kind of fruit ; sprinkle on a little 
sugar, then another layer of bread crumbs and of fruit, and 
so on until the dish is full, the top layer being crumbs. Make 
a custard as for pies, add a pint of milk and mix. Pour it over 



go USES FOR STALE BREAD 

the top of the pudding and bake until the fruit is cooked. 
Stale cake crumbs fine, in place of bread, is an improvement. 



PLAIN BREAD PUDDING. 

Break up a pint of stale bread after cutting away the crust. 
Pour over it a quart of boiling milk ; add to this a piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Cover the dish tightly and let stand

spoonful of cinnamon, one nutmeg grated, half a cupful of 
sugar, and one-quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little 
hot water. Beat up four eggs very light and add last. Turn 
all into a well-buttered pudding dish and bake three-quarters 
of an hour. Serve it warm with hard sauce. This recipe may 
be steamed or boiled. Very nice either way. 

SOUP STICKS. 

Cut stale bread into one to three inch slices, remove crusts, 
butter and brown in the oven. 



TOAST. 

Cut stale bread into slices one-fourth inch thick. Put it 
on a toaster, move it gently over the heat until dry, then allow 
it to become a little brown by placing it nearer the heat and 
turning constantly. It may be first dried in the oven. Hot 
milk may be poured over dry toast. 

ZWIEBACK.

pan and cover with water and enough sugar to make a 
syrup. Boil gently until the figs are tender. Just before 
taking from the fire, put in a slice of lemon and stir it 
around three or four times and then take out. Cut off the

SALADS 115 

dice, and two hard-boiled eggs cut not too fine; season with a 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, salt, white pepper and two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar; mix together, arrange neatly and mask with 
a top layer of salad dressing. 

BEET SALAD. 

If the beets are to be cooked for salad making they are better 
baked than boiled, as they lose none of their rich color. Put 
into a salad bowl a layer of chickory leaves, slice in over this a 
baked beet ; next add two or three roots of boiled oyster plant, 
kohl-rabi, or root celery, a button onion and a cucumber pickle ; 
mask over all salad dressing. If pickled beets are used omit 
the pickle. The chickory may be omitted, and veal or fresh 
pork added. 

BEET AND SPANISH ONION SALAD. 

Cut into slices, then into strips, two baked beets, slice a 
medium-sized Spanish onion, and quarter and separate the sec- 
tions. If convenient add as much table celery as you have onion, 
half a teaspoonful of capers or chopped pickles, salt and white 
pepper; mix, then over all add salad dressing. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

There is only one secret about this salad. Do not use tough, 
old fowl, nor use the meat too dry. When possible let the fowl 
stand in the water in which it was cooked until cold ; this will 
make it sufficiently moist. When cold roast poultry is used, cut 
it up and moisten slightly with chicken broth, or water containing 
a little vinegar, pepper and salt. 

Mix equal quantities of cut-up chicken and celery with a few 
spoonfuls of salad dressing, arrange neatly in a bowl, and 



ii6 SALADS 

mask with more of the dressing. Decorate with eggs, olives 
and cucumber pickle. Use lettuce, watercress, chickory, wild 
chickweed, dandelion, or any other tender salad green when 
celery is scarce. 

CLAM SALAD. 

Boil two dozen medium clams in a pint of water ten minutes 
only ; use the broth for a soup by whisking into it a half pint 
of warm milk containing a whisked egg; heat, but do not boil, 
and serve. 

Chop the clams, not too fine, put them into a salad bowl with 
one-third each of potato and cold fish ; lettuce or watercress may 
or may not be used. Cover with salad dressing. Hard-boiled 
eggs may be used if desired. 

CUCUMBER SALAD. 

The fresher the cucumbers are and the quicker they are served 
after being cut, the better ; always have them as cold as possible. 
They need a good deal of seasoning, therefore add a little salt, 
pepper and salad dressing, slightly thinned out with vinegar. 
Mix, set in the ice-box ten minutes and serve. 

For breakfast the cucumbers may be placed on a leaf bed of 
cress and garnished with a circle of crisp radishes. 

CUCUMBER SALAD TO SERVE WITH FISH. 

Peel the cucumbers, and place them in cold water to become 
crisp. Do not use salt in the water, as is sometimes recom- 
mended, as it wilts and makes them indigestible. Cut the cucum- 
bers in two lengthwise, and lay them, with the flat side down, 
on the dish on which they are to be served. Slice them without 
destroying their shape, and pour on them salad dressing. 



SALADS 117 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Cut the boiled lobster into one-inch pieces or larger. Marinate 
it, and keep in a cool place until ready to serve ; then mix with it 
lightly a little mayonnaise salad dressing. Place it in the salad 
bowl, smooth the top, leaving it high in the center. Mask it 
with a thick covering of salad dressing. Sprinkle over it the 
powdered coral of the lobster. Place on top the heart of a 
head of lettuce, and around the salad a thick border of crisp 
lettuce leaves, carefully selected. 

Shad roe, canned salmon, or any firm, white fish, mixed with 
mayonnaise salad dressing, and garnished with lettuce, may be 
served as a salad. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Use for this salad sour oranges ; if these cannot be obtained, 
strain over sweet oranges after they are sliced a little lemon- 
juice. Cut the oranges in thick slices, remove the seeds carefully, 
arrange them in rows, and turn over them salad dressing. 
Serve with game. 

Grape fruit may be used the same way, and walnut meats 
used with either. 

SHRIMP SALAD. 

\Yhen canned shrimps are used, they should be removed from 
the tin and thoroughly washed in cold water. Shrimps, tomatoes, 
hard-boiled eggs and watercress, with salad dressing, form a 
surprisingly good salad in warm weather. 

WATERCRESS AND APPLES. 

Prepare the watercress the same as lettuce, letting it become 
crisp in cold water, then drying it thoroughly. Mix it with 



ii8 SALADS 

mayonnaise salad dressing. A few thin slices of sour apple with 
watercress make a good salad to serve with ducks. 

A chopped hard-boiled egg sprinkled over the top of water- 
cress is a good garnish, and improves the salad. 



WALDORF. (APPLE AND CELERY SALAD.) 

Use bright red or green apples. Jonathans or Northern Spies 
are best. Cut the stem end off, saving it. Scoop out the apple 
pulp. Mix with one-third its bulk in chopped celery, and salad 
dressing number one, which has had cream added to it. Return 
this apple pulp and celery and dressing to the shell of apple. 
Replace the stem top. Serve the apple, very cold, on a lettuce 
leaf. 



SALAD DRESSING NO. i. 

One level teaspoonful flour, one level tablespoon ful sugar, 
one level teaspoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful white pepper, 
one speck red pepper, yolks of two eggs. Mix these together 
and pour over it seven tablespoonfuls of hot vinegar. Stir well 
until thick. Add one large tablespoonful of butter and when it 
is well mixed in, take the mixture from the fire. Cool quickly. 
This may be kept a week or two. When ready to use, mix it 
with one-third its bulk in rich cream, sweet or sour. Whip the 
cream. 



CREAM DRESSING NO. 2. 

Two tablespoonfuls of whipped sweet cream, two of sugar 
and four of vinegar ; beat well and pour over the cabbage, previ- 
ously cut very fine and seasoned with salt. 



SALADS 119 

POTATO SALAD, HOT. 

Pare six or eight large potatoes, and boil till done, and slice 
thin while hot ; peel and cut up three large onions into small bits 
and mix with the potatoes. Cut up some breakfast bacon into 
small bits, sufficient to fill a teacup and fry it a light brown ; re- 
move the meat, and into the grease stir three tablespoon fuls of 
vinegar, making a sour gravy, which with the bacon pour over 
the potato and onion ; mix lightly. To be eaten when hot. 

POTATO SALAD, COLD. 

Chop cold boiled potatoes fine, with enough raw onions to 
season nicely ; make a dressing as for lettuce salad, and pour 
over it. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful sugar, one-fourth cup- 
ful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one small pinch 
of mustard, one very small pinch of cayenne pepper. Cream 
these ingredients together and add the hot vinegar. When 
cold, and you wish to use it, thin with one-third its bulk of 
very thick cream. Cut up oranges into small pieces and put 
a spoonful of the dressing over the orange. Serve cold. 

FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

Mix one saltspoonful of pepper with one of salt ; add three 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and one even tablespoonful of onion 
scraped fine; then one tablespoonful of vinegar; when well 
mixed, pour the mixture over your salad and stir all till well 
mingled. 

The merit of a salad is that it should be cool, fresh and 
crisp. For vegetables use only the delicate white stalks of 



120 



SALADS 



celery, the small heart-leaves of lettuce, or tenderest stalks 
and leaves of the white cabbage. Keep the vegetable portions 
crisp and fresh until the time for serving, when add the meat. 
For chicken and fish salads use the mayonnaise dressing. For 
simple vegetable salads the French dressing is most appro- 
priate, using onion rather than garlic. 




SANDWICHES 121 



SANDWICHES 



Bread for sandwiches should not be more than twenty-four 
hours old, and cut thin, the crust should all be neatly cut away 
and the butter creamed and evenly spread. If nuts are used 
they should be chopped fine, salted and mixed with butter, or 
with enough cream salad dressing to moisten. 

When preparing sandwiches for a large company it is 
sometimes necessary to make them several hours in advance 
of the serving. If a napkin is wrung out of hot water and 
wrapped around the sandwiches, which should then be placed 
in a cool room, they will keep as fresh and moist as though 
just spread. 

GRAHAM BREAD STRIPS. 

Take thin slices of graham bread and spread lightly with 
butter and then with prepared mustard, then grated cheese; 
press slices of bread firmly together, cut in inch wide strips, 
brown in the oven. To be eaten with salads. 

WATER CRESS SANDWICHES. 

Wash well some water cress and dry them in a clean white 
cloth, pressing out every bit of the moisture. Then mix with 
the cress hard boiled eggs chopped fine, season with salt and 



122 SANDWICHES 

pepper to taste. Cut thin slices of bread and cut away the 
crust. Cut the cress into small pieces, removing the stems. 
Place the cress between each slice of bread and butter, with a 
few drops of lemon juice on each. Press down the slices, and 
serve. 

CHICKEN SANDWICHES.

saucepan with gravy, or cream enough to soften it. Add a 
teaspoonful of butter, a tiny pinch of salt and one of pepper. 
Work it very smooth while it is heating until it looks almost 
like paste. Then spread it on a plate to cool. Spread it be- 
tween slices of buttered bread and crisp lettuce leaves. Press 
both sides together. 

RUSSIAN SANDWICHES. 

Cut bread into very thin slices, then into squares. After 
buttering, spread a layer of fresh Neuchatel cheese on each

naise dressing, then add a layer of this over the cheese. Press 
both sides of the sandwiches together. Serve on a plate 
garnished with lettuce leaves. 

OYSTER SANDWICHES. 

Chop fine half a teacupful of raw oysters; add salt and 
pepper to taste and a dash of cayenne pepper. Put in a sauce- 
pan with two teaspoonfuls of butter and three teaspoonfuls of 
bread-crumbs. Heat until steaming and then add half a tea- 
cupful of thick cream into which has been beaten the yolk of 
an egg. Stir until the mixture thickens. Remove from the 
fire and add five drops of lemon juice. When cold, spread 
between buttered sandwich bread. 



SANDWICHES 123 

HAM SANDWICHES. 

Mince fine three or four small slices of boiled ham, mix

bread into very thin slices, butter, lay on a crisp lettuce leaf, 
and then put in the filling. Press both sides of the sandwiches 
together.

per, and a sprinkling of nutmeg. 

BOSTON SANDWICHES. 

Cut thin slices of Boston brown bread, in rounds, or any 
odd shapes, spread them lightly with cream or Neufchatel 
cheese, take a corresponding number of slices and spread with 
olives and pimentos chopped and mixed with salad dressing; 
press the slices together with a leaf of crisp white lettuce be- 
tween each sandwich. 

TO MAKE BUTTERS FOR SANDWICHES. 

Rub the butter to a cream, blending any flavor desired, 
such as anchovy, caviare, sardine, lobster, cheese, parsley, 
cress, chives, horseradish, any of which may be used. 



124 SANDWICHES 

OLIVE SANDWICHES.

other slice of bread, and butter, press together ; good for 
picnics and outings. 

CUCUMBER SANDWICHES. 

These are quite new. Slice medium sized cucumbers very 
thin, and let them stand in cold salt and water one-half hour, 
then drain off and pour over white wine, or tarragon vinegar, 
with a few drops of lemon juice, let stand one hour, lay the 
cucumber slices upon small rounds of brown bread, and spread 
with butter.

crust, spreading the above mixture between the slices ; gar- 
nish with water cress. 



SANDWICHES 125 

TOASTED SANDWICHES. 

Equal parts of chicken or veal, use one part of cold tongue ; 
to one cupful of meat when chopped add one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, one teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, one- 
half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Cut bread and butter it; 
toast each slice a delicate brown ; spread with the above mix- 
ture while hot and put together. To be eaten cold. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES. 

Cut white bread in thin slices, cutting away all crusts. 
Place on a slice a fine tender lettuce leaf and spread with 
salad dressing; cover over with another slice and press gently 
together. Nasturtium leaves or flowers and a bit of mustard

a little made mustard. Rub very smooth with a silver spoon ; 
spread between thin slices of buttered bread, from which the 
crust has been removed. Pile on a plate on a folded napkin. 



126 SANDWICHES 

NUT SANDWICHES. 

Mix half a cupful of chopped nuts with one tablespoonful 
of mayonnaise and spread on thin slices of entire wheat bread 
trimmed and cut into fancy shapes. Almonds, English wal- 
nuts, or peanuts may be used separately or in combination, 
and chopped dates may be added to the nuts. 

BANANA SANDWICHES. 

Select one large very ripe banana, peel and slice very thin 
and evenly. Sprinkle with one tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
Add a little honey to white cream cheese and spread on dainty 
rounds of bread instead of butter. Place a layer of the sliced 
bananas between the two slices. Preserved ginger and or- 
ange peel minced fine and mixed with a little sweet cream 
may be used for filling. 

LOBSTER SANDWICHES. 

Mix the coral of the lobster with a little butter and spread 
on thin slices of wheat bread. Dust with a little paprika. 
Have half a cup of the lobster meat chopped rather fine and 
mix with one tablespoonful of mayonnaise. Put this between 
the buttered slices with a lettuce leaf on each slice. Press 
the slices together. Serve on a small meat platter, garnished 
with lettuce and olives. 

OYSTER SANDWICHES. 

Half a dozen large oysters fried and perfectly cold, lay a 
crisp lettuce leaf dipped in French dressing on the buttered 
slices of white bread or spread a little dressing on each leaf. 
Cut the oysters into nice little slices crosswise, rejecting the 
hard part, and lay the slices, overlapping one another, be- 
tween the lettuce leaves. 



SANDWICHES 127 

WATERCRESS SANDWICHES. 

Select a five-cent bunch of fresh watercress; remove the 
stems and chop the leaves fine ; add four to six tablespoonfuls 
of salad dressing to the chopped leaves ; mix, and spread over 
thin slices of bread. These sandwiches are appetizing. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 

Chop fine three full-size stalks of celery ; add to this enough 
salad dressing to make a thick paste ; spread evenly over thin 
slices of white, graham, rye, or Boston brown bread; form 
sandwiches and cut these into squares or fingers. 

CAVIAR SANDWICHES. 

This form of sturgeon roe is becoming more and more 
popular with Americans, but one is rarely offered a perfectly 
made caviar sandwich. This is the way they should be made : 
Put into a soup-plate two tablespoonfuls of caviar, one table- 
spoonful of salad dressing and a scant half teaspoonful of 
chopped onion ; mix together, and while mixing, squeeze in the 
juice of half a juicy lemon, using care to remove the seeds. 
Spread the paste over dry thin slices of bread ; form sand- 
wiches and cut these into fingers. The onion may be omitted 
if objected to. 

OLIVE SANDWICHES. 

This is a unique way of serving olives at teas and recep- 
tions. Cut the flesh from the stones of half a dozen queen 
olives, chop it fine, add to it a scant tablespoonful of salad 
dressing. Mix and spread on thin slices of buttered bread; 
form sandwiches and cut these into squares or fingers. Stuffed 
olives are very appetizing served this way. 



128 SANDWICHES 

A sandwich which enjoys great vogue at New York teas 
is easily made. Butter three slices of white bread and two of 
graham. Lay light then dark on top of one another alternately 
and press carefully together, then cut like layer cake in pieces 
half an inch wide. 



GARNISHES 



For oysters, sardines, fish, roast veal or salads, lemon 
slices make a desirable garnish. For cold meats, chops and 
cutlets, parsley or celery tops. 

For decorating fowl nothing better than watercress can 
be used. Balls made of boiled rice with jelly on each are at- 
tractive on a plate of cold meat. 

In garnishing cold corned beef sliced gherkins and large 
pickles sliced make an attractive garnish. For game, cold 
tongue, fried oysters or roast veal, currant jelly is used as 
garnish. 

Never under any circumstances serve a heavy soup at a 
luncheon. 



BEVERAGES 129 



BEVERAGES 



Boiling water is a very important desideratum in the mak- 
ing of a cup of good coffee or tea. Do not boil the water 
more than three or four minutes ; longer boiling ruins the 
water for coffee or tea making, as most of its natural prop- 
erties escape by evaporation, leaving a very insipid liquid, 
composed mostly of lime and iron, that would ruin the best 
coffee, and give the tea a dark, dead look. Water left in the 
tea-kettle over night should never be used ; no matter how ex- 
cellent your coffee or tea may be, it will be ruined by the addi- 
tion of water that has been boiled more than once. 

FILTERED OR DRIP COFFEE. 

For each person allow a large tablespoonful of finely 
ground coffee, and to every tablespoonful allow a cupful of 
boiling water; the coffee to be one part Mocha to two of 
Java. 

Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee- 
pot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin 
for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the 
pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well 
warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as 
much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all 



130 BEVERAGES 

the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the 
coffee to table. Making it in this manner prevents the ne- 
cessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which 
cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee 
gradually so that the infusion may be stronger ; and the bag 
must be well made that none of the grounds may escape 
through the seams and so make the coffee thick and muddy. 
Patented coffee-pots on this principle can be purchased at 
most house-furnishing stores. 



TO MAKE TEA. 

Allow two teaspoonfuls of tea to one large cupful of boil- 
ing water. Scald the teapot, put in the tea, pour on about 
a cupful of boiling water, set it on the fire in a warm place 
where it will not boil, but keep very hot, to almost boiling ; 
let it steep or "draw" ten or twelve minutes. Now fill up 
with as much boiling water as is required. Send hot to the 
table. It is better to use a china or porcelain teapot, but if you 
do use metal let it be tin, new, bright and clean ; never use it 
when the tin is worn off and the iron exposed. If you do you 
are drinking tea-ate of iron. 

To make tea to perfection, boiling water must be poured 
on the leaves directly it boils. Water which has been boiling 
more than five minutes, or which has previously boiled, should 
on no account be used. If the water does not boil, or if it be 
allowed to overboil, the leaves of the tea will be only half- 
opened and the tea itself will be quite spoiled. The water 
should be allowed to remain on the leaves from ten to fifteen 
minutes. 



BEVERAGES 131 

COLD TEA. 

Three tablespoonfuls of tea, six tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
one pint of water, juice of one lemon and a half. Let the tea 
stand in water over night. In the morning strain and add 
the lemon juice and sugar. After it has again stood an hour, 
strain again and the tea is ready for the cracked ice. Serve 
in small soda glasses. 

COFFEE. 

Be careful in buying coffee not to get too much at a time, 
as it loses its flavor, no matter how well sealed. For the 
small family the pulverized is best. Get a half pound of coffee 
and keep in an air tight glass jar. 

Never put dry coffee into the coffee pot, it makes it very 
hard to keep clean inside. A little cold water should be poured 
in first, then the egg, and last the coffee, then mix all together 
thoroughly. 

COFFEE. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of ground coffee with a teaspoon- 
ful of raw egg and two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Pour on 
this two cupfuls of boiling water, cover closely, and let it boil 
up; then remove from the fire. Let it stand a few minutes 
to settle, then strain into a hot coffee pot through a damp 
cheese cloth laid on a wire strainer. 

COCOA. 

Three tablespoonfuls of cocoa to a half pint of water, as 
much milk as water, sugar to taste. Rub the cocoa smooth in 
a little cold water; have ready on the fire half a pint of boiling 



132 BEVERAGES 

water; stir in grated cocoa paste. Boil fifteen minutes, add 
the milk and boil five minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten 
in cups so as to suit different tastes. 

LEMON SYRUP. 

Take the juice of six lemons; grate the rind of three in it, 
let it stand over night. Then take three pounds of white su- 
gar and make a thick syrup. When it is quite cool strain the 
juice into it, and squeeze as much oil from the grated rind as 
will suit the taste. Put into bottles, tightly corked, for future 
use. A tablespoonful in a goblet of ice water will make a 
delicious drink. 

MILK PUNCH FOR INVALIDS. 

One-half pint of milk made very sweet, half a wine glass 
of rum, stir well together. Grate a little nutmeg over the 
top of the glasses. Serve with straws in each glass. 

WINE WHEY FOR INVALIDS. 

Sweeten to taste half a pint of milk, put in a double boiler 
and let come to a boil, throw in one glass of cherry wine. 
When the curd forms, strain the whey through a clean muslin 
bag into small soda glasses. 

ORANGEADE. 

Juice of two oranges, two tablespoonfuls of powdered su- 
gar, four teaspoonfuls of lemon juice, one glass of finely 
chipped ice. Two glasses of water, shake well in a large shak- 
er. Serve in soda glasses, and dress with fruit. 



BEVERAGES 133 

LIMEADE. 

Four tablespoonfuls of lemon syrup, two tablespoonfuls of 
lime juice. Pour over finely chipped ice in mineral glasses. 
Sweeten to taste with powdered sugar. 

GRAPE-JUICEADE. 

Four tablespoonfuls of lemon syrup, four tablespoonfuls of 
grape juice, one glass of water; sweeten to taste. Stir well 
and serve in mineral glasses with straws. 

LEMON EGGNOGG. 

Two tablespoonfuls of lemon syrup, two eggs, four dashes 
of Angastura bitters, one teaspoonful of rum, three table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, one glass of milk, and a cup of 
chipped ice. Shake well in shaker, strain, and serve in soda 
glasses with straws. 

DELMONICO'S EGG-LEMONADE. 

Two fresh eggs, two tablespoonfuls lemon juice, one and a 
half tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, one glass of finely 
chipped ice. Shake well in shaker, strain, and serve. 

EGG-PINEAPPLE. 

Half a cup of pineapple syrup, one cup of sweet cream, 
two eggs, one glass of chipped ice, three tablespoonfuls and 
a half of powdered sugar. Shake and serve in soda glasses 
with straws. 

MINT JULEP. 

Dampen a small bunch of mint, dust with powdered sugar, 
bruise slightly and pour over it a little boiling water; allow 



134 BEVERAGES 

this to draw, then strain into a tall, thin glass quite filled with 
finely cracked ice ; dress the glass with sprigs of mint, and 
pour in enough brandy to fill. Do not stir, but stand it away 
till thoroughly cool. Serve with straws. 

HOT CLAM SODA. 

One teaspoonful of clam juice and a little cream; fill cup 
with hot water, stir with a spoon, and add salt and pepper. 

CREAM DE BEEF BOUILLON. 

Add one ounce of sweet cream to a cup of beef bouillon and 
top with whipped cream and you have a delicious drink. 

DOROTHY ALE. 

Juice of one orange, three teaspoonfuls powdered sugar, 
one egg, one ounce grape juice, one-fourth ounce port wine, 
small quantity shaved ice; fill glass with plain water; shake, 
put in lemonade glass, finish with a slice of pineapple and a 
cherry. 

HOT EGG MILK. 

Two teaspoonfuls of sugar, one ounce cream, one egg, hot 
milk to fill an eight-ounce mug. Top with whipped cream and 
sprinkle with nutmeg. If there is no facility for keeping hot 
milk, use about two ounces of cream, and fill the mug with 
hot water. 

TOAST. 

Here's to the Lady we love and the friend we trust. 
And to the one who thinks the most good and speaks the 
least ill of his neighbor.

BREAKFAST FOODS 



VITOS BREAKFAST FOOD. 

To four and one-half cupfuls of boiling water, add one tea- 
spoonful salt and stir in gradually one cupful Pillsbury's 
Vitos. Let boil two minutes while stirring, then cook in a 
double boiler thirty minutes. If time allows, the flavor is 
much improved by longer cooking. With a single boiler the 
cooking of Vitos may be accomplished in fifteen minutes, but 
this needs careful watching, as the cereal is likely to become 
scorched, and this manner of cooking is wasteful. Serve 
Vitos with rich cream and sugar. 

CREAMED VITOS. 

To two and one-half cupfuls boiling water add one tea- 
spoonful of salt and stir in slowly one cupful of Pillsbury's 
Vitos. Let this boil five minutes, stirring all the time, then 
put it in a double boiler, add two cupfuls milk and let it cook 
for thirty minutes. Serve hot with cream. 

VITOS WHEAT FOOD WITH APPLES. 

Core apples, leaving large cavities ; pare and cook until 
soft in syrup made by boiling sugar and water together. Fill 
cavities with Pillsbury's Vitos mush and serve with sugar and 
cream. The syrup should be saved and re-used.

ENGLISH RAREBIT. 

Cut finely a cup of cheese and crumb a cup of bread 
crumbs, put in your chafing dish or frying pan a piece of but- 
ter the size of a walnut, add the cheese and stir it to a cream. 
Moisten the bread crumbs with a cup of milk, thicken with 
three eggs well beaten. This will serve six or eight persons. 



CHEESE DREAMS. 

Cut thin slices of bread and spread with butter; between 
two slices of the bread sandwich a thin slice of cream cheese. 
Fry quickly in butter in a chafing dish or frying pan. 



142 FOR THE CHAFING DISH 

SHRIMP WIGGLE. 

Make a white sauce of one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of flour, one-half pint milk. When thick add 
one-half can shrimps and one-half can green peas. Serve when 
the shrimps and peas are hot. 

NEW YORK CHAFED OYSTERS. 

Put one pint of oysters in a chafing dish, add butter size 
of an egg, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to taste. 
When the oysters begin to heat, add flour a little at a time, 
to prevent lumps, stirring well, until the gravy is slightly 
thickened. Serve on hot plates. 

PIGS IN BLANKETS. 

Drain and wipe large oysters. Pin around each a thin 
slice of bacon. Fasten it with a wooden toothpick. Cook 
them in the hot blazer until the bacon is brown and crisp. 

STEWED KIDNEYS. 

Split the kidneys and cut each in three pieces. Brown them 
in butter. Stir flour and water in the pan to make a brown 
sauce, and cook the kidneys in this for ten minutes. 

BROILED LAMB CHOPS. 

Have rib chops, with the bones removed, rolled into ros- 
ettes. Broil in the hot blazer from eight to ten minutes, turn- 
ing them several times. Season with salt, pepper and but- 
ter. Broiled tomatoes should accompany this dish. 



FOR THE CHAFING DISH 143 

BROILED TOMATOES. 

Cut large tomatoes in thick slices, without peeling. 
Sprinkle them with a little salt, pepper and sugar and roll 
them in cracker dust. Put a tablespoonful of butter in the 
blazer, and put in the slices of tomato. Turn frequently until 
done. 



WELSH RAREBIT. 

Three cups of cheese, ale, red pepper, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one saltspoonful of mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one saltspoonful of soda or bicarbonate of potash. Put the 
butter in the blazer over boiling water. Break the cheese 
in small pieces and stir it in the melted butter. Season it with 
salt, pepper, and dry mustard, and stir in the soda or potash. 
As the cheese begins to soften, slowly add the ale, two or 
three tablespoonfuls, stirring constantly. In a few moments 
it will be a smooth, thick cream. Stop cooking at once, be- 
fore it has time to curdle. If the cooking stops too soon it 
will be stringy. Serve on toast or crackers. A soft, rich 
cheese should be used. The American cream cheese is very 
good. The Welsh rarebit calls for ale. Cream may be sub- 
stituted for the ale, to make a temperance rarebit. 



BROWN SAUCE. 

One tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, one 
tablespoonful of onion juice, two cups of beef stock. Cook 
the onion, butter and flour until it is brown, add the stock,

before cooking in the chafing dish. Then prepare the white 
sauce and cook the chicken in it for about five minutes. 

DEVILED TONGUE. 

Sprinkle slices of tongue with mustard and red pepper,

butter. Season with salt and a dash of red pepper, and pour 
over the sherry. Cover the pan and cook five minutes. Mix 
the beaten eggs with the cream, and pour it on the lobster. 
Serve as soon as it boils. Shrimp and hard-shelled crab 
may be prepared the same. 

SPRING CHICKEN. 

Take one spring chicken and split open, lay in cold water 
for one hour ; one-half Bermuda onion sliced and one-fourth 
pound best butter. Braise the onion to a delicate brown ; one- 
half teaspoonful of paprika, steam chicken thoroughly and 



146 FOR THE CHAFING DISH 

braise and cover until nearly done; do not break the chicken; 
put in one tablespoonful flour, shake well, add one pint of

light brown in butter, lay them in a hot chafing dish. To the 
butter in the spider add a little more butter, add as much 
flour as you did butter, stir well and add milk or cream, 
season to taste and pour over the tomatoes. It is best to serve 
either fried or broiled tomatoes in a chafing dish, as they cook 
very quickly.

All of the materials must be as cool as possible. 

Pastry flour should be used. 

The following fats may be used alone or in combinations 
of two ; butter, butterine, lard, cottolene, beef drippings. The 
fat should not be cut very fine, if a flaky crust is desired. Bak- 
ing powder is sometimes used. 

The dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched 
with the hands. It should be rolled in one direction only, 
and on one side, using but little flour. The dough is rolled 
thin and baked until brown. 

All pies made with fresh fruit should be made without an 
under crust, and cooked in a deep earthen-ware plate. Fill 
the plate very full. If sugar is used with fruit pies, it should 
be placed on the bottom of the pie plate. Meat and oyster- 
pies should also be made without an undercrust. The crust 
should be cut in several places to allow the steam to escape. 

If an under crust is used, this crust should be baked on the 
outside of a tin plate, then filled. In this case, the crust must 
be pricked all over with a fork so that it may keep its shape. 

If two crusts are used, the lower one should be moistened 
around the edge with cold water, then a half-inch strip of 
paste should be placed around the edge of the under-crust. 



PIES 149 

This strip should also be moistened, and the upper crust placed 
over the pie and pressed slightly around the edge. 

The paste may be made the day before using, then covered 
and placed on ice. It rolls more easily if placed on ice after 
mixing. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 

One and one-fourth cupfuls of pastry flour, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-third cupful of fat and butter, one-half of 
each, ice water. Mix in the order given. 

PIE CRUST FOR ONE PIE. 

One large cup flour, one-half cup shortening (lard and but- 
ter mixed) rubbed through the hands into the flour, a little salt, 
and wet with ice-cold water to make the dough just so it can 
be handled ; flour the board, or, what is better, a marble slab. 
Divide the crust in two parts and cover the plate, reserving 
the rest for upper crust. This is a plain crust and just enough 
for one pie. Especially good for fruit pies. 

PIE CRUST. 

One even cupful of flour, and one teaspoonful of salt. Sift 
several times. Cut into the flour half a cup of ice cold lard, 
add four tablespoonfuls of ice cold water, stir with a spoon. 
Divide the paste in two equal parts, roll out one part for the 
under crust. The other half roll out an eighth of an inch 
thick, dot it with a teaspoonful and a half of butter, dredge 
very lightly with flour, fold up to the smallest size possible, 
pat with the rolling pin, and roll out once, pressing the rolling 
pin this way and that. Slash with a knife any design you 
like, lay upon the fruit in the pan, pinch the edges together; 
trim. Bake in hot oven. 



i S o PIES 

GRANDMOTHER'S PUMPKIN PIE. 

Eight tablespoons pumpkin, one cup of sugar, one egg, 
one cup of milk, one teaspoonful molasses, pinch of salt; stir 
all together and set over a dish of hot water until it thickens; 
then fill the crusts and bake in a moderate oven. 

GRANDMOTHER'S APPLE PIE. 

One pint of flour and one teaspoonful salt, one tablespoon- 
ful of lard and two of butter, six tablespoonfuls of ice water, 
five good sized tart apples, one and one-half cups sugar, but- 
ter the size of walnut, one half cupful water and either cin- 
namon, nutmeg or allspice to suit the taste; put flour, salt, 
lard and butter into a chopping bowl and chop until the lard 
and butter are like small sized peas; then add the water 
without mixing; turn out on the board and roll and fold over; 
continue to do so until the crust is smooth ; then line the pie- 
tin and fill with sliced apples and spice; do not put on a 
particle of sugar; then the upper crust with a slit cut in it; 
bake ; put on the fire the sugar, water and butter ; boil fifteen 
minutes or until it thickens; then pour through the slit you 
have made in the pie before it was baked; this sweetens the 
pie ; the crust is not soggy, and the juice does not run out in 
the oven while baking as in the old way. 

RIPE CURRANT PIE. 

One cupful of mashed ripe currants, one of sugar, two ta- 
blespoonfuls of water, one of flour, beaten with the yolks of 
two eggs. Bake ; frost the top with the beaten whites of the 
eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and brown in 
the oven. 



PIES 151 

APPLE LEMON PIE. 

Two tart apples chopped fine, two eggs beaten, juice of 
two lemons, grated rind of one, a pinch of salt ; bake between 
two crusts. 

RASPBERRY PIE. 

Line a shallow pudding dish, or deep plate, with pie crust 
and fill with berries ; a cup of granulated sugar, mixed with 
one tablespoonful of flour; cover with a tolerably thick sheet 
of crust ; make several incisions for the escaping steam ; bake 
until crusts are a delicate brown ; serve cool. 

CHERRY PIE. 

Line your pie tin with good crust, fill half full with ripe 
stoned cherries; sprinkle over them one cupful of sugar, one 
teaspoonful of flour sifted, dots of butter here and there. Now 
fill the crust to the top with more cherries. Cover with the 
upper crust and bake. This is a most delicious pie. 

MINCE MEAT. 

One half a cupful of mixed candied citron, lemon and or- 
ange peels, half a cupful of suet, a cupful and a half of mixed 
raisins and currants, a cupful and a half of chopped apples, 
one cupful of cooked beef chopped fine, one heaping table- 
spoonful and a half of molasses, three tablespoonfuls of brown 
sugar, one teaspoonful and a half of mixed spices (nutmeg, 
allspice, cloves, cinnamon and black pepper), three pinches of 
salt, half a cup of brandy and half a cup of cider mixed. 
Cover the raisins with cold water and seed them. Wash and 
pick over the currants, cover both currants and raisins with 



152 PIES 

cold water and cook slowly until the water has boiled away. 
Add the candied fruit and suet chopped fine, sugar, molasses, 
spices and cider, boil slowly one hour and ten minutes, stirring 
quite often. Mix apples and meat together, add salt and other 
ingredients, cook thoroughly fifteen minutes. Put away in 
jar in a cool place until wanted. This makes one large pie. 
Before covering the pie, it is a good idea to lay on top a few 
nut meats, either hickory or English walnuts. 

Mince meat should stand at least three days before using. 

PIE PLANT PIE. 

Wash and skin the pie plant, and cut in inch length pieces, 
put in granite pan and cover with cold water and heat to 
boiling and drain off the water ; to two cupfuls of pie plant 
add one cupful sugar, a tablespoonful of flour mixed. Line 
the plate with paste, put in the pie plant and cover with thin 
crust with slashes for steam to escape, and keep the juice from 
running out while cooking. Bake till the crust is a delicate 
brown. 

BAKERS' CUSTARD PIE. 

Beat up the yolks of three eggs to a cream. Stir thorough- 
ly a tablespoonful of sifted flour into three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar; this separates the particles of flour so that there will 
be no lumps ; then add to it the beaten yolks, put in a pinch of 
salt, a teaspoonful of vanilla and a little grated nutmeg; next 
the well-beaten whites of the eggs ; and, lastly, a pint of scald- 
ed milk (not boiled) which has been cooled; mix this in by 
degrees and turn all into a deep pie-pan lined with puff paste, 
and bake from twenty-five to thirty minutes. 



PIES 153 

WHIPPED CREAM PIE. 

Line a pie plate with a rich crust and bake quickly in a 
hot oven. When done, spread with a thin layer of jelly or 
jam, then whip one cupful of thick sweet cream until it is as 
light as possible ; sweeten with powdered sugar and flavor with 
vanilla; spread over the jelly or jam; set the cream where 
it will get very cold before whipping. 

CRANBERRY PIE. 

Take fine, sound, ripe cranberries and with a sharp knife 
split each one until you have a heaping coffee cupful ; put 
them in a vegetable dish or basin ; put over them one cupful 
of white sugar, half a cup of water, a tablespoonful of 
sifted flour; stir it all together and put into your crust. Cover 
with an upper crust and bake slowly in a moderate oven. 
You will find this the true way of making a cranberry pie. 

APPLE PIE. 

Wipe and cut tart apples into eighths ; remove the cores 
and skins. Vary the amount of sugar according to the acidity 
of the apples, using two tablespoonfuls or more for an apple. 
If the apples are not juicy, add from one-half tablespoonful to 
one tablespoonful water, according to the size of the apple. 

The apples may be flavored with lemon juice, cinnamon or 
nutmeg, and should be covered with bits of butter. Bake until 
the apples are soft and the crust is brown. Apple sauce may 
be used on a baked crust. 

LEMON PIE. 

One-fourth cupful flour, one cupful sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, juice and rind of one lemon, four tablespoon- 



154 PIES

utes, stirring frequently, add the mixture to the egg, add but- 
ter and lemon, and cook until the egg thickens. When the mix- 
ture is cool, place it in a baked crust. Cover with a meringue, 
and bake until a delicate brown.

oughly cooked, place in crust and make a meringue of the 
whites; put on top and set in oven to brown ; one pie. 

SQUASH PIE.

the seeds and peel; put into a saucepan and cover with salt 
water. Mash fine ; one good cupful will make a pie. Use the 
other as a vegetable. Beat the yolk of one egg with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a half teaspoonful of ground ginger, 
three pinches of salt, and two-thirds of a cup of hot milk ; 
pour on slowly, stirring all the time. Add a teaspoonful and 
a half of butter and a heaping cup of hot mashed squash, a 
scant teaspoonful of flour, three pinches of grated nutmeg.

174 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 



Fruits, Jellies, Preserves, Etc. 



Fruit for preserving should be sound and free from all de- 
fects, using dry white sugar. If the sugar is the least bit 
moist, put in the oven and heat it, but do not let it get the least 
brown. There cannot be too much care taken in selecting 
fruit for jellies, for if the fruit is over ripe, any amount cf 
time in boiling it will never make it jelly. In preserving be 
generous with the sugar. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Take large, ripe cherries, and to each pound of cherries 
allow a pound of loaf sugar. Stone the cherries and save the 
juice that comes from them in the process. As you stone 
them, throw them into a large pan or tureen and throw half 
the sugar over them and let them lie in it two hours after they 
are all stoned. Then put them in the kettle with the remain- 
der of the sugar. Boil and skim them till the fruit is clear and 
the syrup thick. Put away in tightly sealed jars. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Stem and pick over the berries carefully. Mash well, and 
pour all into a preserving kettle and cook slowly for ten min- 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 175 

utes to extract the juice. Strain through a colander, and then 
through a jelly-bag, keeping it as hot as possible as it jellies 
much quicker. A few quince seeds boiled with the berries 
the first time tend to stiffen it. Allow a pound of loaf sugar to 
every pint of juice, and boil fast for twenty-five minutes. Try 
a little on a cold dish and when it seems done, remove and put 
into jelly glasses. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Stem three quarts of currants and put into a small-mouthed 
stone jar, tie over it a thick brown paper, set it into a ket- 
tle of water and let them cook one hour after the water begins 
to boil. Then strain through a flannel bag. Pour the juice 
into a procelain kettle and let it just come to a boil. Take it 
from the stove and stir in equal amount of sugar slowly, that it 
may have time to dissolve. Pour into glasses and let it cool ; 
when cool, cover with white paper dipped in brandy and iaid 
on the top of the jelly. Tie or seal over a large piece of paper. 
Put away in cool dry place. A good thing to do is to heat 
the sugar in the oven, as it drives out the moisture and causes 
the fruit to jelly more readily. Try and make it a point to 
make jelly on a bright, sunny day. 

PLUM MARMALADE. 

After the juice is taken from the plums, rub the pulp 
through a colander. To this add an equal amount of sugar 
and boil twenty minutes. Put up like jelly. 

PLUM JELLY. 

To one peck of plums add three pints of water, boil until 
soft, pour into a jelly bag and let it drip, but do not squeeze. 



176 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 

Take equal weights of juice and sugar, and boil twenty min- 
utes or until it jellies. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

To one pound of currant juice take five pounds of rasp- 
berries and five pounds of sugar. Put the sugar and berries 
in layers, mash them and let them stand one hour, then add 
the currant juice and boil a half-hour. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Select sound, ripe peaches. Peel, halve, and stone them. 
For every quart of peaches an equal amount of sugar. To 
every three pounds of sugar, add one cupful of boiling water. 
Melt, and boil fifteen minutes. Then drop in the peaches and 
cook them until a straw will pierce them easily. Skim care- 
fully and put into heated jars. Boil and skim the syrup eight 
minutes longer, fill the jars with the syrup and seal. 

A good plan is to halve and stone them before peel- 
ing, or take a dozen or more peaches and scald them by pour- 
ing boiling water over them and let stand two minutes, no 
longer. In this way they will easily peel. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Above all, peaches must be spotless and not too ripe. 
Peel carefully, but do not stone them, as it adds to the flavor. 
Allow one pint of water and one cupful of sugar to every quart 
of peaches. Boil sugar and water for fifteen minutes ; then 
add the peaches a few at a time and boil gently, and when a 
broom straw will pierce them easily they have cooked enough. 
Put the peaches in jars that have been well heated with boil- 
ing water, put the peaches in two thirds full. Boil and skim 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 177 

the syrup and pour over the peaches until the jars are full. 
Seal at once. Keep canned goods in a cool, dark place, the 
darker the better. 



SPICED PEACHES. 

Five pounds of peaches, two and a half pounds of sugar, 
one-quarter of a pint of cider vinegar, a quarter of an ounce 
of stick cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of whole cloves, a 
quarter of a teaspoonful of whole allspice, and an eighth of a 
nutmeg broken into bits. Boil the sugar and vinegar together 
fifteen minutes. Put in enough peeled peaches to cover the 
bottom of the kettle and cook gently until a straw will pierce 
them easily. Skim the peaches out very carefully. Put them 
on a hot platter and cook the remainder of the peaches in the 
same way. When done, drain off the juice, put it in the kettle, 
boil up, and skim. Put the peaches in a stone jar, pour the hot 
syrup over them, tie the spices in a bag and lay on top. Cover 
closely, and in five days pour off the juice, boil up, and pour 
hot over the peaches. Cover tightly, with heavy brown paper 
or a coarse cloth. Keep in a cold, dry, dark place. 

PRESERVED WATERMELON. 

Take the thick rind of a ripe watermelon, cut it into small 
strips, cut off all the red part and scrape the outside. Boil the 
rind with peach leaves and saleratus twelve leaves and one 
teaspoonful of saleratus to two quarts of water. This will 
turn them green. Boil till tender, then take them out and put 
them into cold water with a half tablespoonful of alum dis- 
solved in it to make them brittle. Let them soak one hour. 
Then rinse them in clear water and boil fifteen or twenty min- 
utes in a syrup of equal parts of sugar and water adding lem- 



i;8 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 

ons cut into small pieces, allowing one lemon to two pounds of 
rind. When cool, add a little extract of ginger. Let them 
stand three days. Then pour the syrup off, boil it till very 
rich, and just cover the rinds. Pour on boiling hot. 

CANNED PEACHES, OR OTHER FRUIT. 

Make a syrup of two pints of water and four pints of sugar. 
Let it boil, put in the peaches and cook till tender, then fill 
the cans. Add more sugar as the syrup thins by putting in 
fruit. 

While canning fruit, put a table knife all around inside of 
the jar, moving slowly, until the bubbles do not rise. Then 
fill again. 

AMBROSIA. 

Two sweet oranges peeled and sliced, four slices of pine- 
apple, and a half cupful of grated cocoanut. Place alternate 
layers of orange and pineapple with the grated cocoanut be- 
tween, and sprinkle pulverized sugar over each layer. This 
is delicious. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and allow 
an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the parings and cores 
and put in a preserving kettle ; cover them with water and boil 
for half an hour; then strain through a hair sieve, and put 
the juice back into the kettle and boil the quinces in it a little 
at a time until they are tender, lift out as they are done 
with a drainer and lay on a dish ; if the liquid seems scarce 
add more water. When all are cooked, throw into this liquor 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 179 

the sugar, and allow it to boil ten minutes before putting in 
the quinces; let them boil until they change color, say one 
hour and a quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are boih'ng oc- 
casionally slip a silver spoon under them to see that they, do 
not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh lem- 
ons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put in jars 
lay a slice or two in each. Quinces may be steamed until 
tender.

HOLIDAY CANDY-MAKING AT HOME. 

The cream candies should be put into a closely covered 
dish as soon as cold, and they are much better after being kept 
this way for several days. Horehound, butter-scotch, taffy, 
etc., should also be kept covered, as this prevents them from 
becoming moist and sticky. 

Fondant is the foundation for innumerable kinds of cream 
candies and is made as follows : 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful of hot water, 
and one-third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Place on 
the back of the stove and stir until thoroughly dissolved. If 
there are any grains around the sides of the pan, clean off 
with a damp cloth before letting it come to a boil. Boil over 
a quick fire until a little of it dropped into cold water will 
make a soft ball. Remove the mixture from the fire and put 
it aside to cool, leaving it in the dish in which it was cooked. 
Do not put it into cold water to cool. When cool (not cold) 
stir until it becomes a thick creamy mass. When it is too hard 
to stir any more, take it into the hands and knead. Kneading 
the fondant has somewhat the same effect on the candy as 
kneading dough has upon bread ; it makes it light and smooth. 
Then put it into an earthen dish, cover with a slightly damp- 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 185 

ened cloth and let stand until desired for use. It will be better 
after standing for two or three days, and it will keep for a 
week or more. If the fondant is grainy after being stirred, put 
more water with it, dissolve again and cook as before, taking 
care not to jar the pan either while it is cooking or cooling. 

For pink fondant use the same proportions as for the white, 
adding half a tablespoonful of pink sugar, which can be bought 
of a confectioner and is inexpensive, a small quantity lasting a 
long time. 

For maple fondant use : Two cupfuls of light-brown (cof- 
fee C) sugar, a cupful of maple syrup, a cupful of hot water 
and one-third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. This is 
more easily made than either of the other kinds, as the brown 
sugar is more moist than the white and is not as likely to 
grain. It is, therefore, a good one with which to begin. 

NUT WAFERS. 

Use white fondant for these. It is not well to melt too 
much at a time, because it will get hard before you can drop 
it all. Have ready over the fire a pan with about half an inch 
of water in it. Put the fondant into a small stew-pan and 
place the pan in the water for the fondant to melt. Flavor 
with vanilla, stir in broken walnut meats and drop from a 
spoon on parafine paper. Pecan nuts, black walnuts, hickory 
nuts, etc., may also be treated in this way. 

WALNUT CREAMS. 

These may be made with either the white or maple fondant. 
Roll a piece of the fondant into a ball and press well into each 
side half a walnut meat, then lay aside on parafine paper to 
harden. The white fondant should have a few drops of vanil- 
la worked into it before being made up into balls. 



1 86 CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 

COcuANUT WAFERS. 

Use white fondant. Melt, flavor with vanilla and mix in 
shredded cocoanut until quite stiff; then drop on paraffine 
paper. 

PEPPERMINT AND WINTERGREEN WAFERS. 

Use white fondant, or pink for the wintergreen, if pre- 
ferred. Melt, flavor with two or three drops of peppermint or 
wintergreen oil and drop on the paper in small round wafers. 
These are very nice and are more quickly made than any of the 
others, as well as less expensive. Maple wafers may be made 
in the same way, but no flavoring is necessary for them. 

BUTTERSCOTCH. 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful of Golden 
Drip syrup, half a cupful of butter. Cook the ingredients un- 
til they make a hard ball when dropped into water. Pour 
into buttered pans, having the candy about half an inch 
thick. Cut into squares when cool and wrap in paraffine 
paper. 

HOREHOUND. 

Packages of the horehound can be bought of a druggist 
at trifling expense. Two-thirds of a teaspoonful of this 
steeped for a few minutes makes a flavor strong enough for 
three cupfuls of sugar. Use the proportions of a cupful of 
water to two cupfuls of sugar and half a teaspoonful of cream 
of tartar. Strain the tea carefully and pour it over the sugar ; 
add water and cream of tartar and stir until thoroughly dis- 
solved. Boil until when dropped into water it is very brittle 
and does not seem at all chewy. Pour into pans and mark 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 187 

into squares when cool. If covered, this will keep for weeks 
without getting sticky. Half a cupful of Coffee C sugar add- 
ed to the granulated makes a better color for this candy. 



FUDGE. 

'ihree cupfuls granulated sugar, one cupful of milk. Boil, 
and when it hardens a little in cold water add one tablespoon- 
ful butter and two squares of chocolate. Take from the stove, 
beat well and put in buttered tin. Walnuts may be added. 

WALNUT PANOCHA. 

Four cups of light brown sugar, one-half cup cream or 
milk. Boil five minutes. Put in one cup chopped walnut 
meats, boil about three minutes, then take off and stir until 
cool and thick enough to put on buttered platter. 

MACAROONS. 

One-half pound almonds, blanched and dried and pounded 
in a mortar, with one teaspoonful rose water ; beat the whites 
of three eggs with one gill of powdered sugar, adding one ta- 
blespoonful at a time, one-half teaspoonful almond extract, 
the powdered almonds, and, if the paste is too soft, add a tea- 
spoonful flour ; wet the hands, shape the paste into balls ; 
place on buttered paper and bake slowly. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

One cup of grated chocolate, one cup of molasses, one 
cup brown sugar, butter size of a small egg; put all in sauce- 
pan, except chocolate ; test by dropping in cold water ; when 
done pour on buttered pans.

with essence of peppermint. 

CANDIED ORANGE PEEL. 

When oranges are used save the peels by putting in a jar 
of salt and water ; when there are what you wish to candy put- 
them on the stove in cold water ; boil up well and drain and 
put in clear water, changing till the bitter is out of the peel

FUDGE. 

Two cups sugar and one cup cream or milk, one-fourth 
pound chocolate unsweetened, small piece of butter; when it 
begins to boil stir constantly; when it hardens slightly in 
water take from range ; flavor with vanilla and stir till cool ; 
turn on a buttered tin ; when cold cut in squares. 

BRANDY TUTTI FRUTTI. 

Just before strawberry season put one quart of brandy and 
three pounds of sugar in a three gallon jar; stir this frequently 
and when strawberries are ripe hull three pounds and put them 
in the jar, with three pounds of sugar. Always add an equal 
weight of fruit and sugar. Add each fruit in season. Stone 
the cherries; plums must be cut in pieces; peaches and apri- 
cots pared and sliced; pineapples are a delicious addition. 
This mixture must be covered closely in a cool place and 
stirred every day until the jar is full. Serve with ice cream 
and blanc manges. 

CREAM TAFFY. 

Take two pounds of light brown sugar ; pour over it 
enough cold water to cover it well before putting it over the 
fire; after it begins to boil add a tablespoonful of vinegar; 
just before the taffy is done put in a lump of butter the size of 
a small egg; cook till it will be quite hard when dropped 
into cold water. Do not stir at all or the taffy will be sugar 
before pulled. Remove from the fire and put in flavoring; 
pour quickly into well buttered platters and set in cool place. 
Begin to pull as soon as it is possible to take it into the hands. 
The quicker it is pulled the better it will be. If a flavor is de- 
sired add one tablespoonful of grated chocolate to each platter 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 191 

just after it is poured out. As the taffy is pulled the choco- 
late will mix with it. Pull as long as possible, till it is quite 
hard and very white, and cut in small pieces ; put aside for sev- 
eral hours. It will cream nicely. 

BUTTER SCOTCH. 

Two cups white sugar, four tablespoons molasses, four 
tablespoons water, small half cup vinegar. Cook until it hard- 
ens in cold water, then add one-half cup butter. Flavor with 
vanilla.

INVALID COOKING 



INDIAN MEAL GRUEL. 

One quart boiling water, one tablespoonful flour, two ta- 
blespoonfuls white corn meal, one-half cupful cold water, one- 
half teaspoonful salt ; mix the flour, meal and salt in the cold 
water, add to the boiling water and cook ten or fifteen minutes, 
stirring all the time. Remove to the back of range and let 
cook half an hour longer, stirring it occasionally ; strain 
through very fine sieve or cloth. To each cup of the gruel 
add one-half cup of milk, one-fourth teaspoonful of butter, 
more salt if needed, and a tiny bit of sugar if the gruel is 
liked better sweetened ; a teaspoonful of whipped cream added 
to a cupful of gruel makes it more tempting; place the cream 
on top of the cup just as it is ready to serve. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One neck of mutton, one-fourth cupful pearl barley, one 
stalk celery, one onion, one sprig parsley, one teaspoonful of 
salt ; cover the meat with cold water after it is washed and 
cut into rather small pieces, add the washed barley ; let it come 
to a boil slowly, add the vegetables cut small and one tea- 
spoonful salt. Simmer until the meat drops from the bones ; 



INVALID COOKING 193 

let the broth become cold. Remove every particle of fat, 
strain through cloth or fine wire sieve ; boil, pour into cups 
and put a tablespoonful of whipped cream on each cup of the 
hot broth. 



OATMEAL GRUEL. 

One cupful oatmeal, three pints cold water; boil slowly 
three hours or more until the oatmeal is creamy. Strain 
through a fine sieve, rubbing part of the oatmeal through. 
Do not try to rub too much or the gruel will be too thick. 
This can be set in the ice box and re-heated as needed, but it 
should be strained from the dish in which it is prepared into 
cups, as the jelly is apt to remain in little particles in the 
milk. For each cup of the prepared gruel add one-half cupful 
milk, one-fourth teaspoonful butter, salt to taste. One tea- 
spoonful sugar is considered an addition by some. 

CLAM BROTH. 

This will be found specially acceptable before breakfast and 
it is so easily prepared that it can be made fresh daily. Pro- 
cure a dozen clams in the shell, scrub well in cold water to 
remove every particle of sand, place in a saucepan, cover with 
boiling water about a pint and boil about fifteen minutes, 
or until all the clams are open. Take out the shells, chop the 
clams fine, skim the broth, return the clams to it, season to 
taste, with a tiny bit of butter or cream, pepper and salt, if 
necessary, and serve piping hot in a cup with toast or crack- 
ers. It may be necessary to strain the clams out entirely for 
one very ill, but all the properties of the clam with the lime in 
the shells are preserved in the broth.

FRUIT SYRUP. 

A refreshing drink to use in fever cases may be made from 
dried peaches or apricots. Thoroughly wash one-half pound 
of the fruit, taking it piece by piece between the thumb and 
forefinger. Soak over night in one quart of water. In the 
morning simmer for half an hour, strain and chill. 

BARLEY GRUEL. 

Barley gruel is made the same as the oatmeal gruel, sub- 
stituting washed barley for the oatmeal. 

CRUST COFFEE. 

Dry stale slices of bread in the oven until it is as brown 
as the coffee berry, but do not scorch it ; pour boiling water 
over the bread and set on the back of the stove for a few min- 
utes, where it will keep very hot but not boil. Pour off the 
liquid carefully and serve with cream and sugar. 

TOAST WATER. 

Toast brown bread without burning it and put into cold 
water; it will be ready for use in one hour; if preferred sweet 
add loaf sugar to taste. 

BEEF TEA. 

Two pounds lean beef, one and one-half quarts cold water; 
chop the beef fine, pour on the water, let stand one hour, then 
set back on the range and let come to a boil slowly. Simmer 
one hour, strain through cheese cloth, and season to taste. 
Serve very hot. 



INVALID COOKING 195 

TO CLARIFY BEEF TEA. 

Add one-half white of egg slightly beaten to one pint of 
cold beef tea ; let it come to a boil and strain through cheese 
cloth. 

BEEF BROTH. 

A nutritious beef broth that can be kept a week in the 
winter is made in this way : Order three pounds of solid beef 
from the shoulder or shin and three pounds of bone from the 
shank. Have the butcher crack the latter. Trim off any 
dried pieces of skin or soft or bloody portions of meat, and 
put the bones and meat in a stone jar. Cover with four 
quarts of cold water, set in a slow oven and cook, covered, 
from eight to twelve hours. Strain and season with two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt. Set aside, uncovered, to cool. If you wish 
to keep it for several days do not remove the fat, which will 
rise to the top and harden. Take out a little as needed, heat 
and serve very hot. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

As the convalescent nears the pudding stage, an old-fash- 
ioned floating island is nourishing and digestible. Heat a pint 
and a half of milk in the double boiler until scalding, but do 
not allow it to boil. Beat the yolks of three eggs with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and pour over the egg and sugar very 
gradually a cupful of the hot milk. Return to the boiler with 
the rest of the milk and cook until it begins to thicken. When 
cooked flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla or orange and 
pour into a glass dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, adding a half cup of currant jelly a teaspoonful at a 



196 INVALID COOKING 

time. Spread over the custard and place in a rather cool oven 
for a few moments to "set." 

FRIZZLED EGGS. 

Put a piece of butter the size of a small nut in a cup with 
a pinch of salt, a little white pepper. Break in two eggs with- 
out stirring. Cook in a pan of boiling water until the whites 
are set. Serve immediately. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 

Pound one-half raw chicken, bones and meat together, with 
a wooden potato masher or mallet. Heat slowly in three pints 
of cold water. Cover and cook until the meat is in shreds and 
the water reduced one-half. Strain through a hair sieve and 
season with pepper and salt, then let it simmer about five 
minutes. When cold skim ; keep on ice, and serve with 
wafers. Very nourishing for the convalescent. 

APPLE DAINTY. 

Wipe, quarter, pare and core apples ; to each pint allow 
one-third of a cupful of sugar, one-third cupful of cold water, 
a speck of cloves. Put into an earthen dish, cover tightly 
and bake slowly eight hours. \Vhen candied and deep red in 
color pile lightly on a dish, and pour over a boiled custard, 
made with the yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of su- 
gar, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla and one pint of scalded 
milk. Pile lightly over this the three whites, beaten with one 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

A good sponge cake served with sweet cream or a glass of 
milk makes an excellent lunch for an invalid. To make the 



INVALID COOKING 197 

cake, beat six eggs and a cup of sugar together until perfectly 
creamy, light and white. Add a teaspoonful of flavoring, and 
two tablespoonfuls of cold water and beat again. Stir in 
lightly one cupful of sifted flour, with a scant teaspoonful of 
baking powder with it, but do not beat. Merely fold it in. 
Bake in a deep tin in a rather slow oven. 



BAKED CUSTARD. 

Many cooks believe that the baked custard must be served 
in the baking dish or cup, and they never attempt to unmould 
it ; this can be done easily if the mould is buttered before the 
custard is poured in. If the moulds are small the usual 
proportion of eggs is sufficient, but if large, it is well to add 
one more egg to a quart of milk. Scald one pint of milk and 
pour over three beaten eggs, beaten with one-quarter cupful 
of sugar, one-quarter level teaspoonful of salt, and one-half 
teaspoonful flavoring. Strain into buttered mould holding one 
and one-half pints. Set in a pan of hot water in a moderate 
oven and bake slowly until firm, then unmould onto a dish 
for serving. 



UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE. 

Cover Concord grapes with cold water (after removing 
from the stems and washing thoroughly in a colander), then 
boil until tender. Press the juice through a wire sieve and 
add to it one cupful of sugar to every three quarts of fruit 
juice. Place over the fire, let just come to a boil, and bottle 
hot. Do not let grapes boil too long the first time, nor any 
more than boil up the last time, or the flavor will be impaired. 
Serve with cracked ice. For invalids, dilute one-half. 



I 9 8 INVALID COOKING 

WINE JELLY. 

One ounce of gelatine, one and one-half quarts of water, 
one and one-half pounds of sugar, three lemons, two tumblers 
sherry wine, one wine glass brandy, one-fourth teaspoonful 
essence of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the water till 
thoroughly dissolved, add the sugar and the lemons cut in 
thin slices, the wine, brandy and cinnamon. Let it come just 
to a boil. Strain into moulds and set on ice to harden. 

. EGG NOG. 

Beat three eggs, yolks and whites separately, mix the 
yolks with three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Beat well and then 
add one pint of rich milk and grated nutmeg, four teaspoon- 
fuls of the best whiskey. Lastly whip in the whites of the 
eggs. 

CHICKEN CUSTARD. 

To one-half pint of cream add one-half pint of strained 
chicken stock ; heat in a double boiler. When hot add the 
well beaten yolks of two eggs. Cook to the consistency of 
soft custard. Season with salt and turn into cups, and serve 
cold. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Heat one pint of chicken stock boiling hot. Beat two 
eggs and yolks well, add to boiling mixture and cook three 
minutes. Flavor with sherry and serve hot. 

LEMON JELLY. 

One teaspoonful of granulated gelatine. Soak in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, add four tablespoonfuls of boil- 



INVALID COOKING 199 

ing water, two tablespoonfuls sugar and the juice of one-half 
lemon. Turn into a mould and set in ice water to harden. 



ROSE GELATINE. 

Use any brand of gelatine that has rose coloring, mould 
in long shallow granite pan, just thick enough to cut out 
heart shaped pieces with a cookie cutter. These come in heart 
shapes and can be used in cutting sandwiches too. Serve with 
whipped cream not sweetened. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One-fourth of a pound of neck of mutton ; cut off all fat 
and skin, cut the meat in small pieces, add to it two table- 
spoonfuls of barley and two cupfuls of cold water. Heat 
slowly to the boiling point and skim carefully and set back 
on the stove where it will just simmer (180 degrees Fah.). 
Cover the bones with one cupful of cold water and cook slowly 
forty minutes, strain the broth from the bones to the meat 
and barley and cook two hours more. Strain and season with 
salt. 

MUSHES. 

The following formula will apply to the cooking of all 
cereals. The importance of the long cooking of all starchy 
material cannot be too strongly emphasized. 

To one cupful of cereal, add one teaspoonful of salt. 
Have the water boiling rapidly, drop in the cereal slowly, 
that the water may not cease boiling, cook rapidly directly 
over the fire until the starch grains have swollen and burst 
open the cellulose pockets, and the mixture has thickened 
and settled. Now place the top of the double boiler over 



200 INVALID COOKIXG 

the lower part and steam from six to eight hours. The 
amount of water used should be one-fourth more than is given 
on the package. 

An attractive method of serving mush is to remove the 
core of an apple, making a large cavity, steam it and when 
done fill the cavity with the cooked cereal. If it is desired 
to serve more cereal, a wall of cereal may be formed around 
the apple. Serve with cream and sugar to taste. Dates, 
figs and raisins properly prepared may be served with the 
cereals. 

OYSTER TOAST. 

Serve broiled oysters on cream toast and sprinkle with 
minced celery. 

BROILED TENDERLOIN. 

Cut an inch slice of tenderloin, broil eight minutes over 
coals, turning every ten seconds. At the same time broil a 
small piece of round. Press the juice of the round over the 
tenderloin, season with butter, salt and lemon juice. A little 
minced parsley may be added. 

EGG TOAST. 

Brown a slice of bread nicely, dip in hot water slightly 
salted, butter it, and lay on top of this toast an egg that has 
been broken into boiling water and cooked until the white is 
hardened. Season the egg with a bit of butter and a little 
salt. 

The best way to cook an egg for an invalid is to drop 
it into boiling water, or pour boiling water over the egg in 
the shell and let it stand a few minutes on the back of the 
stove.

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

Cook celery until soft, mash and rub through a sieve. 
This is celery puree. Add five or six drops of onion juice to 
the -puree. Melt one level tablespoonful of butter, add the 
same amount of flour and cook together until frothy. To 
the flour and butter add one-fourth of a cupful of celery 
puree and one-half cupful of boiling water and cook together 
five minutes, then add one-fourth cupful of milk and the same 
of cream. Heat to 160 degrees Fah. and serve seasoned with 
salt and pepper. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Cook together as above one-half tablespoonful of butter 
and flour, add one-fourth cupful of hot milk, cook until it 
thickens a very little, add two level tablespoonfuls of cooked 
and strained pea-pulp, seasoned with one-eighth of a tea- 
spoonful of salt and one-fourth of a teaspoonful of sugar. 
You may add a little whipped cream. Serve hot. 

BEEF JUICE. 

Beef juice obtained from best round steak, which has 
been merely heated through over the coals, and then entirely 
deprived of soluble substances by a meat press, is the most 
concentrated form of liquid food. If prepared with the most 
scrupulous neatness from the best materials and served at 
once, it leaves nothing to be desired. To prepare the press 
for use in making the beef juice, it should stand in boiling 
water for thirty minutes. 

Take beef from upper part of round, broil over coals, hold- 
ing broiler close to the coals (when it is not possible to have 
coals it may be broiled on a very hot pan) until well browned. 



202 INVALID COOKING 

Now put pieces in the press that has been standing in hot 
water, and press out the juices into a cup standing in hot 
water. Season with a little salt and pepper, and it is ready 
to serve. It is often offered to a sick person in a red glass, 
that the color may not be offensive. It may be taken to the 
sick room in a bowl of hot water that it may be served 
hot. Hot water added, it becomes beef tea. 

CLAM BROTH. 

Procure clams in the shell, scrub the shells with a 
brush, put ten or twelve shells in a kettle with a very lit- 
tle hot water, cover kettle and let steam until shells open. 
Drain out the juice, dilute the broth with water and season 
with salt. 



IRISH-MOSS LEMONADE. 

Pick over and wash one-fourth of a cupful of Irish-moss, 
pour on one pint of boiling water and cook two hours, just 
below the boiling point, 200 degrees Fah. Strain and add 
lemon juice and sugar to taste. Excellent for bronchial 
troubles. 



EGG LEMONADE. 

Separate white from yolk of egg. Beat the yolk until 
stiff and creamy. Add the juice of one lemon, beat thorough- 
ly, add two level teaspoonfuls of sugar, fold in the white of 
the egg, beaten stiff and dry. Pour over shaved ice in a 
glass, let stand five minutes, and serve. The yolk may be 
omitted if too rich. 



INVALID COOKING 203 

GRUELS. 

Any kind of grain requires long, slow cooking. 

RICE GRUEL. 

Two level tablespoonfuls of cracked or crushed rice, two 
cupfuls of boiling salted water. Cook two hours over hot 
water. Strain out the grains and dilute with milk or cream. 
Serve hot or cold. It is delicious with whipped cream. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

One-half cupful of rolled or crushed oatmeal, the same 
amount of cold water. Stir well, let settle, and drain wa- 
ter into a stewpan. Repeat this four times ; that is, add 
one-half cupful of cold water to the same oatmeal four times. 
Cook the strained water until thickened, directly over the 
fire. Now pour into the top of a double boiler and steam 
two hours, add salt, season with lemon juice, beef tea, cream 
or milk. 

EGG GRUEL. 

Separate the yolk and white of an egg. beat both very 
stiff, add a few drops of lemon juice to the yolk, add one 
tablespoonful, more or less, of sugar to the beaten white, 
fold the white into the yolk and pour over all one cup of 
heated milk, beating rapidly all the time. Flavor as desired. 

SOUPS. 

Milk soups are another way of serving hot milk, flavored 
with more or less pulp of the vegetables that grow above 
the ground, which are tender and rich in mineral substances. 
The milk should not be heated above 160 degrees Fah.

long, break the top of the shell at once by patting it with a 
spoon. This lets out some of the heat, and the hardening proc- 
ess will be stopped immediately. 

A Paint-Stained Dress. If you happen to get wet paint 
on your dress, rub the stain at once with another piece of the 
same material, and the stain will entirely disappear. You 
can use another and covered part of the same garment. What 
happens to the paint it is difficult to say, but it certainly 
vanishes. 

Grease Marks on Wall Papers. These can be removed by 
applying a paste of pipeclay and water to the stains, and al- 
lowing this to dry on all one night or day. Then the powder- 
should be gently brushed off without scraping the paper. 

To Clean Carved Ivory Articles. The beauty of carved 
ivory curios is frequently spoiled by the amount of dust which 
collects in the interstices, so those who possess them will be 
glad to hear of an excellent method of cleaning the ivory 
effectually. A paste should be made of sawdust, water and a 
few drops of lemon juice. This paste should be applied thick- 
ly all over the carving, and be permitted to dry on. When 
finally brushed off with a soft, firm brush, the preparation will 
be found to have left the ivory pure and white once more. 

To Remove Rust Stains from Matting. Cover the stain 
with paper and place a warm iron on this. When the spot is 
warm dip a glass rod in a bottle of muriatic acid and go over 
the rust spot with it, wetting every part with the acid. The 
spot will turn a bright yellow. Instantly wash it with an old 
toothbrush dipped in boiling water, rub dry with woolen 



206 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

cloths. Before beginning the work have all the appliances 
ready, and then work rapidly from start to finish. Muriatic 
acid corrodes metals, therefore keep the bottle corked tight 
when not using it. Two or three ounces of the acid will be 
ample. 

Flower vases can be easily purified and cleaned by rins- 
ing them out with warm water and powdered charcoal. 

When cutting new bread always put the knife in hot water 
first, and you will find that it facilitates the cutting. 

To Keep Clothespins New. To prevent new clothespins 
from splitting, let them stand in cold water a few hours be- 
fore using. 

A box filled with lime and placed on the shelf in a pan- 
try and frequently renewed will absorb the damp, and keep the 
air pure and dry. 

\Yhen weighing molasses for cooking purposes, if the scale 
is well floured first the syrup will run off quite smoothly, 
without leaving any stickiness behind. 

Good Polish for Oilcloth. Save all candle ends and melt 
in the oven ; mix with it sufficient turpentine to make a soft 
paste. This is excellent for linoleum, etc. 

Celery should be allowed to lie in cold water, to which 
a little salt has been added, for an hour before it is re- 
quired for the table. This will make it very crisp. 

To Brighten Copperware. A* little crushed borax if 
sprinkled thickly on a flannel cloth that is wet with hot water 
and well soaped will brighten the copper like magic.

To darken brown boots that have seen their best days rub 
all over with a piece of clean white flannel wet in ammonia. 
Do this twice, then polish with the usual brown liquid, and 
they will look as nice as ever. 

Tapestry-Covered Furniture. To clean this, first brush 
thoroughly ; then add a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of 
water. Wring a cloth out of this, and sponge thoroughly, rins- 
ing and turning the cloth as it gets dirty, changing the water 
when necessary. This freshens and brightens it wonderfully. 

Scrubbing Board Floors. Plenty of soap and cold water 
and no soda are the secrets of success in washing board floors, 
and the wood must be scrubbed the way of the grain and not 
round and round, if you want to get the dirt off. Change the 
water often. You can't expect boards to be a good color if 
they are rinsed in dirty water. 

Tissue paper should never be thrown away. Save it all 
up for polishing windows and mirrors, or for removing the 
first coating of grease from dishes previous to their immersion 
in the dishpan. 

Few housekeepers pay the attention they should to their 
ice boxes. An ice box can be kept in perfect condition if 
it is thoroughly cleansed once a week, but twice is better. 
The box should be thoroughly washed with strong soda water, 
and the drain pipes should be washed out. An ice box should 
always be full of ice, it is the poorest economy to allow the 
supply to decrease, and if sufficient ice is provided the box 
can be kept at an even temperature, which insures the pres- 
ervation of the food it contains. There are people who, from a 
false idea of economy, fail to get the best results from the 



208 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

use of ice and refrigerators. A common mistake is getting 
a small piece of ice every day or every other day, instead of 
filling the ice chamber two or three times a week. The 
small piece of ice cannot reduce the temperature sufficiently 
and the result is that each new piece melts rapidly and the 
food cannot be kept. 

Never use soda for washing china that has any gilding 
on it, for the soda will in time surely remove it all. Instead 
of soda, use a little soap ; that has no bad effect. 

Put a teaspoonful of ammonia in a quart of water, wash 
your brushes and combs in this, and all grease and dirt will 
disappear. Rinse, shake, and dry in the sun, or by the fire. 

To renovate leather furniture, wash it with soap and water 
and when dry apply a little vaseline, rubbed in with the 
hand. Let it remain till next morning, then polish with a 
soft duster. This treatment will prevent the leather from 
cracking. 

Coal that is kept in a dry and airy place will burn much 
longer than that which is kept in a close cellar, with no 
ventilation. When coal remains long in an airless place it 
gets rid of its gas, and the absence of this renders it less 
powerful and more wasteful when burned. 

Carpets in rooms which are seldom used are apt to be at- 
tacked by moths. Salt sprinkled around the edges and well 
under the carpet before it is put down will generally prevent 
their ravages. Plenty of light and air should be admitted 
into the rooms, as moths favor close, dark places. 

Boots and shoes will last much longer if, when wet, 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 209 

they are placed on their sides and allowed to dry, pulling 
the uppers as flat as possible. By this means the soles are 
exposed to the air and dry better. It is also a good plan, 
when one does not possess boot-trees, to fill the boots or 
shoes with soft, crumpled paper or oats, so that they keep 
their shape. 

To prevent portieres catching under the door when opened 
quickly, screw a small ring (such as are used for picture 
frames) into the center of the door frame, to this fasten a 
blind cord sufficient to reach to the bottom of curtain. Put 
another ring in center of door at top, thread cord through, 
and fasten to bottom of curtain. As the door is opened so 
the curtain rises. 

To keep ants, moths or any other insects out of the closets 
or pantry, sprinkle the shelves and corners wtih sassafras oil, 
and they will soon bid you "good-bye." 

A fairly sizable piece of black velveteen, perhaps a quarter 
of a yard, makes the most satisfactory brush for silk that 
can be had ; it removes the dust perfectly and yet does not 
injure the fabric. 

Care of Bath Rooms. Plenty of fresh air and a generous 
flushing of pipes, using disinfectants every two weeks at 
least. Copperas is the very best ; dissolve a couple of pounds 
of crystals in a gallon of water, pouring a portion of it hot 
down the drains. It has no odor, but will stain any clothing, 
and must be used with care. 

For backache and pain in the chest the Belladonna and 
Capsicum plaster is the best and can be obtained at all drug 
stores.

DAINTY WAYS OF USING ROSE LEAVES. 

With the blooming of roses the woman who keeps abreast 
of the times is on the alert to gather in every leaf of the fra- 
grant harvest. From time immemorial the Orientals have 
utilized roses for their choicest sweets and flavors. Our 
great grandmothers were adepts in the preparation of rose fla- 
vors and pot pourris, but the modern woman has been slow 
in awakening to their possibilities. 

The rose pillow is now esteemed the acme of daintiness 
for the new baby's carriage or the bride's outfit. 

To collect a sufficient supply, make a systematic tour of 
the garden each morning while the dew is still on, provided 
with basket and shears. Select the roses whose petals are 
ready to fall, shake into the basket, snip off the denuded stem 
and throw it away. Carry the fragrant burden to the garret 
or spare room, where papers have been spread upon the 
floor, and empty the petals upon them. Stir and turn every 
day until perfectly dry, transferring to bags when that is ac- 
complished. 

When a sufficient amount of petals has been collected, put 
in pretty cases made of fine hemstitched handkerchiefs fagot- 
ed together, through which white or rose-colored ribbon may 
be run. These wash beautifully. If something more elab- 
orate is desirable, a bolting cloth cover, embroidered or hand 
painted with roses, is dainty and effective. 

For rose syrup, collect fresh petals each morning and 
spread on a tray to dry. When enough have been collected for 
a tumbler of preserve, put in a fresh granite or porcelain 
kettle with just enough water to cover, and simmer until ten- 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 211 

der. Add sugar in the proportion of a pound to each pint of 
the leaves and water and cook to a rich syrup. The Turkish 
women frequently use honey in place of sugar, one-half pound 
of the honey equaling a pound of sugar. 

This syrup gives a delicious flavor to a pudding sauce or 
mince meat, or it may be utilized as a sweet at a Turkish 
tea. Pour in glasses and seal. 

To secure rose flavoring, fill a wide-mouthed bottle with 
fresh petals, packing them down as tight as possible. Then 
pour over them enough pure alcohol to submerge. 

Richer and stronger is rose brandy. Fill a glass jar with 
fragrant petals, and cover with French brandy. Next day 
pour off the brandy, take out the leaves and replace with fresh 
ones. Return the brandy. Do this several times, until the 
brandy is strongly impregnated. Then strain and bottle 
tightly. Keep the can covered during the distillation process. 

The petals of the yellow rose infused in boiling water 
furnish a delicate dye, which is attractive with old-fashioned 
rose desserts and for home-made candy. 

To make candied rose leaves, gather fresh leaves and 
spread them on an inverted sieve or oiled paper in the open 
air until slightly dry, but not crisp. Mak.e a syrup, using 
a half pint of water and a half pound of granulated sugar, 
and boil until it spins a thread. Dip each rose leaf in this 
syrup, using a hat pin or fine wire. Then lay back in place. 
After several hours melt a half cupful of fondant, add two or 
three drops essence of rose, a drop of cochineal to color, and 
a few drops of water to thin. Dip the leaves in this one by 
one, sprinkle with crystallized sugar, and return to the oiled 
paper to harden.

To make calico wash well infuse three gills of salt in 
four quarts of boiling water, and put in the calicoes while 
hot, and leave them till cold. In this way the colors are 
rendered permanent and will not fade by subsequent washing. 

To remove paint and putty from window glass put suffi- 
cient saleratus into hot water to make a strong solution and 
with this saturate the paint or putty, which adheres to the 
glass. Let it remain till nearly dry, then rub off with a 
woolen cloth. 

To disinfect a room from the smell of tobacco or close- 
ness, place in an open mouthed jar one-half spirits of laven- 
der and a lump of salt of ammonia, leaving it uncovered. It 
is excellent. 

If our lady readers wish to keep a bouquet fresh let 
them drop a teaspoonful of powdered charcoal into the water 
intended for the flower stalks, and; they will keep their 
freshness and perfume for several days, and look and smell 
the same as those just gathered. The charcoal settles to the 
bottom of the vase, the water remaining clear. 

For burns nothing excels linseed oil and lime water. Dip 
cotton in the lotion and apply to burn and bandage. 

Many jewels require an occasional sleep, in order to retain 
their brilliancy. Diamonds, rubies, opals and sapphires are 
among the number. They should be put away in total dark- 
ness every now and then. The usual velvet or satin lined 
cases are the correct receptacles. It is best to wrap them 
in jewelers' tissue paper, then pack them in wool and lay in 
air-tight compartments. A number of stones are seriously 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 213 

affected by fumes from furnaces, sewer gas, moisture, and 
sea air. 

The effect of ammonia on vegetation is very beneficial. 
If you desire your plants to become more flourishing, try it 
upon them by adding six drops to every pint of water you 
give them. Do not repeat this oftener than once in eight 
days, lest you stimulate them too highly. 

Two pounds of alum dissolved in three quarts of boiling 
water and applied to all cracks and crevices will keep out 
ants, roaches and bedbugs. 

To clean straw matting, use a coarse cloth dipped in salt 
and water. Wipe dry. The salt will keep the matting from 
turning yellow. 

To remove ink stains, apply lemon juice and salt and lay 
the articles in the sun. 

No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of 
ammonia, for besides its medical value, it is very desirable 
for household purposes. With a pint of suds mix a teaspoon 
of spirits, dip in your silver knives, forks and spoons, and 
rub them with a brush and polish with a chamois skin. 

For washing mirrors and windows, put a few drops of am- 
monia on a piece of paper and it will readily take off every 
spot of finger marks on the glass. 

Ammonia entirely absorbs all obnoxious smell so often 
arising from the feet in hot weather. 

To take spots from wash goods, rub them well with the 
yolk of egg before washing. 



214 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

Ammonia is a most refreshing agent at the toilet table. 
A few drops in a basin will make a better bath than pure 
water. 

To take white spots from varnished furniture, hold a hot 
plate over them and they will disappear. 

Salt will remove the stains from silver caused by eggs. 
Apply dry with a soft cloth. 

Never allow meat to remain in paper; it absorbs the 
juices. 

To prevent the odor of cabbage or onion, throw red pepper 
pods into the pan they are cooking in. 

A package of Gold Dust and a cake of Sapolio should be 
kept in every kitchen, to be used freely on all dishes that 
require scouring and cleansing. 

Salt will curdle new milk, hence in preparing milk por- 
ridge, gravies, etc., the salt should not be added until the 
dish is prepared. 

Salt and beeswax will make rusty flatirons as clean and 
smooth as glass. Tie a lump of wax in a bag and keep it for 
the purpose. When the irons are hot, rub them first with the 
wax bag, then scour them with a paper or cloth sprinkled 
with salt. 

Blue ointment and kerosene mixed in equal proportions 
and applied to the bedsteads is an unfailing bedbug remedy, 
as a coat of white wash is for the walls of a log house. 

Kerosene will soften boots or shoes that have been hard- 
ened by water and make them pliable as new. 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 215 

When cheese becomes too hard, grate it and put it away 
in covered bottles; it is useful for macaroni. 

Salt toughens meat if added before it is done. 

Crackers are much more crisp if set in a hot oven a few 
minutes before serving. 

To brown flour, put a few tablespoonfuls of flour on the 
bottom of a baking dish, and stir until it has become brown. 
Bottle and keep for future use. 

If you value your own and your family's digestion, don't 
serve tea with fish. The tannic acid hardens the fiber and 
makes it indigestible. It should not be offered with any 
form of fish, shell-fish, or the articulate animals like lobsters 
and crabs. Iced tea and soft-shell crabs, for example, are 
a combination that should be avoided. 

One of the dyed chamois-skins is an excellent lamp mat 
for a polished table the rich red, green, or a certain shade of 
peacock blue. A red one goes especially -well with a lamp 
of Egyptian design. 

A recent addition to the list of savory salts is onion 
salt, which is now put up in shaker cans or bottles for flavor- 
ing use. 

As most of the people cook by gas perhaps the following 
suggestions may be a help in the saving of gas. Puddings, 
pies, and beans can be baked well at small expense by using 
a small tin oven, such as comes for oil stoves. Place the oven 
over one of the single burners, and you will find it will give 
a very satisfactory bake with only a low flame. This little 
oven is fine for keeping the dishes warm and the victuals 
hot. 



216 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

If you wish to serve peas as an entree, cut out with a cookie 
cutter a round of bread from an ordinary sized slice of bread, 
then two rings with a doughnut cutter. Dip them in melted 
butter and toast delicately brown in the oven. Fill the cavities 
with peas cooked in a delicate cream sauce. 

Tissue paper should never be thrown away. Save it all up 
for polishing windows and mirrors. 

Never use soda for washing china that has any gilding 
on it, for the soda will in time surely remove it all. Instead 
of soda, use a little soap ; that has no bad effect. 

Put a teaspoonful of ammonia in a quart of water, wash 
your brushes and combs in this, and all grease and dirt will 
disappear. Rinse, shake, and dry in the sun, or by the fire. 

Ink spots on mahogany may be removed by being touched 
with a feather dipped in oil of vitriol diluted with twice its 
quantity of water. The spot should be well and quickly 
rubbed. 

To renovate leather furniture, wash it with a little soap- 
and-water, and when dry apply a little vaseline, rubbed in 
with the hand. Let it remain till next morning, then polish 
with a soft duster. This treatment will prevent the leather 
from cracking. 

A few drops of oil of lavender in a silver bowl or orna- 
mental dish of some kind, half filled with very hot water, and 
set in the dining-room just before dinner is served, gives a de- 
lightful and intangible freshness to the atmosphere of the 
apartment. Hostesses often put a small vessel in the parlor 
and dressing-rooms when arranging the house for a festivity. 
The suggestion is especially valuable to the hostess in a small 
apartment, which sometimes in the bustle of preparation be- 
comes stuffy.

Household Uses for Pure Refined Paraffine Wax. 

For Washing One-half teacup of Paraffine Wax shavings 
te one ordinary bar of washing soap, both dissolved in a little 
hot water, is sufficient for one boiler of washing. Pour this 
mixture when dissolved into the boiler of hot water (the best 
results are obtained by dipping the clothes into cold water 
then wringing and putting into the boiler). Boil the clothes 
thirty minutes, after which all that is required to have beauti- 
ful, white clothes is the usual sudsing, rinsing and bluing. Us- 
ing Paraffine Wax as above will save hard rubbing and scrub- 
bing. Will take the dirt out of your clothes without hard 
rubbing. Absolutely pure and will not injure the most delicate 
fabrics. Has no taste or odor. Just as important as soap for 
laundry work. 

For Ironing A teaspoon of MELTED Paraffine Wax 
mixed with the hot starch insures a smooth, glossy finish. 

Irons are kept smooth, bright and clean by rubbing them 
over small pads made of Paraffine Wax covered with cheese- 
cloth or old linen. 

For Sealing Preserves When the jam or jelly is cool, wipe 
the inside rim of the glass with a cloth to insure perfect clean- 
liness ; then pour in the melted Paraffine Wax until it is about 
one-fourth of an inch thick. Let stand until the Wax hardens 
and turns white. No other cover is necessary. If the fruit is 
thoroughly cooled before pouring on the melted Wax it will 
not mix with the fruit. 

For Cake and Pie Pans Warm the pans and rub the in- 
side with Paraffine Wax. This is superior to the old method 
of greasing the pans with butter.

Do not throw away bits of toilet soap. Get a quart or 
pint Mason jar and put in the bits of soap. Pour in alcohol 
not quite enough to cover the soap. This will make a jelly 
which will be found very useful for the hands, in the bath, 
and for shampooing. Just before using add three drops of 
lavender or rose. 

To prevent flannels from turning yellow lay pieces of 
white wax in the folds of white flannel or Swiss muslin. 

The following are a few of the many articles which should 
be in every household in case of emergency especially if a 
doctor is not to be obtainable immediately. Absorbent cotton, 
bandages of convenient length and width of old cotton (which 
every housekeeper has if carefully saved), old linen hand- 
kerchiefs, pieces of soft flannel, prepared mustard leaves, 
adhesive plasters, arnica, pure vaseline, Collodion, Witch- 
hazel, ammonia, borax, ipecac, spirits camphor, aconite No. 3 
labeled "poison." No. 2 is invaluable in the household if ad- 
ministered carefully in fever, ten drops in a glass of water, 
dose one teaspoonful each hour. Pure wine, whiskey, or 
brandy if occasion requires. 

The hot water bags are indispensable (and can be obtained 
at slight cost). One per cent solution of carbolic acid is very 
useful (also a deadly poison) in cases of injury because of its 
cleansing qualities. If a cut is to be treated, the wound 
should be cleansed in clear tepid water, then rinsed with the 
carbolic solution, then painted with collodion, which staunches 
the blood and serves as a varnish to keep out air and any dirt. 

The solution of carbolic above mentioned is excellent for 
burns ; saturate the cotton and put on to the afflicted spot, 
bandage and keep wet. 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

Trifling injuries, whether cuts or tears, should be gently 
cleansed with hike warm water poured over the wound, then 
replace the skin or tissue, and lay a clean white cloth soaked 
in laudanum, or alcohol, or water over the injured part and 
loosely bind on. 

Aromatic spirits of ammonia should never be allowed t > 
run low, as its uses are so many, especially where there are 
any persons in the family with a tendency to fainting spells, 
or weak heart, as it facilitates the heart action, and is less 
dangerous than liquor. In case of fainting, a small teaspoon- 
ful in a half glass of water may be given, and the patient 
placed on the floor on his back, with the head low, garments 
loosened about neck, chest, waist, etc. Sprinkle water on the 
face, and hold smelling salts or spirits of camphor under the 
nose. Care should be taken, however, not to hold it too near, 
and produce strangling but first of all lay the person on the 
back and the head slightly lower than the body. After a faint 
a slight stimulant in hot water, either 15 drops of aromatic 
spirits of ammonia, or a very little wine or whiskey in water, 
may be useful. 

Bleeding from extracting a tooth. Press a plug of cotton 
over the cavity, holding it firmly there. Salt and water is 
also useful. 

Splints. Great ingenuity may be used in this matter. 
When a sudden emergency arises, pasteboard, shingles, a piece 
of a cigar box, or anything smooth and stiff may be used, and 
it should be padded to make it as comfortable as possible. 

For Fractures. Use cloths wet in cold water immediately, 
to prevent as far as possible the swelling, which naturally fol- 
lows soon after the accident. This will assist the doctor. 



220 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

Vegetables to be cooked by boiling should be put into boil- 
ing water as little as possible, and if water is added let it be 
boiling hot. Steaming or baking is best for most vegetables, 
their finer flavors being retained. 

Vinegar is a sure and swift antidote for carbolic acid 
poison. It has been stated that there are more accidental 
deaths from poisonous acids than any other poisonous drugs. 
The antidote is common cider vinegar, which is to be found in 
every household. 

CROUP. 

A teaspoonful of powdered alum in a little syrup every 
half hour until free emesis occurs, or one teaspoonful of Syr. 
of Ipecac every ten minutes. 

SUMMER COMPLAINT. 

For adults give one teaspoonfuL of Squibbs Tr. Opii Com- 
pound every hour until better. 

HAY FEVER. 

Aqua Ammonia cautiously inhaled is sometimes very effi- 
cacious. 

HEARTBURN. 
Soda mint tablets. 

SORE THROAT. 

Use equal parts of Listerine and Hydrogen Peroxide and 
gargle frequently with a tablespoonful of the mixture in one 
half cup of hot water. 

VOMITING. 

Give iced champagne or brandy in small quantities fre- 
quently. The proportionate dose for any age under adult life

is represented by the number of the next birthday divided by 
24, i. e. For one year, 2-24 equal 1-12; for two years 3-24 
equal 1-8. 

CONSTIPATION. 

For children glycerine suppositories infants' size ; for 
adults one fig before breakfast or prunes stewed with senna 
tea are often very efficient. 

EAR-ACHE. 

Sweet almond oil as hot as it can be borne, dropped into 
ear. Chloroform on swab ; rub behind and in front of ear. 

PERSPIRING FEET. 

Equal parts of salicylic acid and powdered borax. Put in 
sufficient water to dissolve and soak the stockings in this so- 
lution, allowing them to dry on the feet.

PREFACE 

Recipes designed for small families are rare, and yet there 
are thousands of wives in our cities who cook for only two. 
It follows that they must either cut down large recipes found 
in the ordinary cook book, which can rarely be done success- 
fully, or they must cook the full amount with resulting 
waste. During my experience of keeping house in a fiat for 
my husband and myself, I have tried to cook with economy 
with the help of my large cook book, and I have both wasted 
and experimented much and have gradually compiled for my 
own use a book of proved recipes, many of which have been 
given me by friends who have compounded and proved them. 
I now publish the book, believing that it will fill a long felt 
need. It has been my aim in preparing the book to have it 
contain rules for making many dainty and delicious dishes not 
often found in cook books. 




What shall I have for dinner? 

What shall 1 have for tea? 
An omelet, a chop or two, 

Or a savory fricassee? 



Dear! how I wish that Nature 

When she made her mighty plan 

Hadn't given the task to woman 
To care for hungry man. 

— Anon. 



SOUPS 



SOUPS 



Soup will be as good the second day as the first if heated 
to the boiling point. It should never be left in the pot, but 
should be turned into a dish or shallow pan, and set aside to 
get cold. Never cover it up, as that will cause it to turn sour 
very quickly. 

Before heating a second time, remove all the fat from the 
top. If this be melted in, the flavor of the soup will certainly 
be spoiled. 

Thickened soups require nearly double the seasoning used 
for thin soups or broth. 

The meat from which soup has been made is good to serve 
cold thus : Take out all the bones, season with pepper and 
salt, and catsup, if liked, then chop it small, tie it in a cloth, 
and lay it between two plates, with a weight on the upper 
one ; slice it thin for luncheon or supper ; or make sandwiches 
of it ; or make a hash for breakfast ; or make it into balls, with 
the addition of a little wheat flour and an egg, and serve them 
fried in fat, or boil in the soup. 

An agreeable flavor is sometimes imparted to soup by 
sticking some cloves into the meat used for making stock; 
a few slices of onions fried very brown in butter are nice ; 
also flour brov/ned by simply putting it into a saucepan over 
the fire and stirring it constantly until it is a dark brown. 



8 SOUPS 

Clear soups must be perfectly transparent, and thickened 
soups about the consistency of cream. When coups and gra- 
vies are kept from day to day in hot weather, they should be 
warmed up every day, and put into fresh-scalded pans or tu- 
reens, and placed in a cool cellar. In temperate weather, every 
other day may be sufficient. 

EGG DUMPLINGS FOR SOUP. 

To half a pint of milk put two well-beaten eggs, and as 
much wheat flour as will make a smooth, rather thick batter 
free from lumps ; drop this batter, a tablespoonful at a time, 
into boiling soup. 

SHRIMP BISQUE. 

Stir one heaping tablespoonful of flour with enough milk 
or cream to make a paste ; put into the sauce pan one-half pint 
of milk — good measure ; the yolk of one egg well beaten ; 
tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste ; add one-half 
cup chopped shrimps the last thing. Serve hot. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP. 

One-half pint of canned tomatoes, one-half pint of milk, 
one heaping teaspoonful of butter, quarter teaspoonful of 
soda. Cook tomatoes a few minutes and then strain them, 
put on the stove again, adding the butter, salt and pepper, and 
a little of the soda, and thicken with flour until quite thick; 
heat the milk separately in a double boiler until boiling hot ; 
When time to serve, add the remainder of the soda to the to- 
matoes and a little minced parsley. Lastly add the boiling 
milk. Serve in heated soup bowls. 



SOUPS 9 

CREAM OF CELERY. 

Cut the outside stalks of a bunch of celery in small pieces; 
boil until tender, keeping covered with water; when boiled 
tender rub through a gravy strainer; add one pint and one- 
quarter of milk, teaspoonful of butter, salt, and stir in slowly 
a little flour paste ; let boil a little and serve hot. 

WINTER VEGETABLE SOUP. 

Scrape and slice one small turnip, and one carrot, and peel 
one small onion and fry all with a little butter until a light 
yellow ; add three stalks of celery, two of leeks, cut into small 
pieces ; stir and fry all for five minutes ; when fried, add two 
stalks of parsley minced, one clove, salt and pepper and a 
little grated nutmeg; cover with three pints of boiling water, 
and simmer for one hour. Take off the scum, strain and 
serve. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

One pint of oysters, one-half pint of milk, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of butter, one-half teacupful of boiling water ; salt 
and pepper. Strain all the liquor from the oysters; add the 
water and heat. When near the boil, add the seasoning, then 
the oysters. Cook about five minutes from the time they be- 
gin to simmer, until they ruffle. Stir in the butter, cook one 
minute, and pour into the tureen. Stir in boiling milk and 
send to table hot. 

CLAM SOUP. 

One dozen clams chopped fine. Put over the fire the liquor 
that was drained from them, one cupful of water, add the 



10 SOUPS 

clams and boil twenty-five minutes. Then season to taste with 
salt and pepper and a teaspoonful of butter ; boil up again and 
pour in one pint of boiling milk. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
flour made to a cream with a little cold milk, or one cracker 
rolled fine. Serve hot in a heated tureen. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Put into a kettle the neck, lower parts of the legs, and thf 
wing tips of a large fat fowl. Dredge with flour, and add a 
pint of cold watei. After letting it soak three-quarters of an 
hour, simmer slowly, keeping the kettle closely covered and 
let the meat drop from the bones. Strain and put the broth 
back on the stove, adding a cupful more of water to the bones 
and cook a good half hour longer. Add this liquor to the 
broth. (There should be a pint of the broth.) Season with 
salt and pepper, and a little minced parsley, according to 
taste. Serve with tiny squares of toasted bread browned in the 
oven. The remainder of the chicken can be used for fricassc. 

STOCK. 

Get a five cent beef bone, and boil two hours with plenty 
of water. This will make a pint of soup stock. Boil this 
stock with chopped carrots, parsnips, potatoes and onions, if 
vegetable soup is wanted, or flavor with strained, canned to- 
matoes if tomato soup is wanted, or use clear as bouillon. 
A half teaspoonful of extract of beef improves the color and 
adds richness to the flavor of the bouillon. 

RICE BALLS. 

Rice balls make a pretty company garnish for soup to be 
used instead of plain rice. Mash or stir down with a fork a 



SOUPS II 

cupful of cold boiled rice, and mix with a batter made of one 
whole egg beaten, a tablespoonful of flour, with a seasoning 
of salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Stir smooth and make 
into balls not larger than a small marble. These are dropped 
into the soup just before it is sent to the table. 

BEAN SOUP. 

One cupful of beans, one quart of water, ham bone, one 
pint of milk, one-half teaspoonful of butter. Boil the beans 
fifteen minutes. Boil with the ham bone three hours. Rub 
through a gravy strainer, add hot milk until it is of the proper 
consistency, and add the butter. Serve at once. 

CLAM-CELERY SOUP. 

Ten clams chopped, one pint water, one pint milk, one 
tablespoonful butter, yolks of two eggs beaten, one-half single 
head of celery, chopped fine, and one very small onion, 
chopped fine, salt and pepper to taste. Rub butter and flour 
together, thickening the hot water with it. When cooked 
smooth, add celery and onion, cooking twenty minutes. If 
clams are fresh, add them, too, but if canned, only heat 
through. Just before serving, add milk, which has been heat- 
ing in another dish, the yolks of eggs and seasoning, not allow- 
ing to cook. 

CREAM OF FISH SOUP. 

Rid cold cooked fish (fresh), of any kind of bones, fat and 
skin, and mince fine ; season to taste. For each cupful of this 
allow two cupfuls of boiling water, in which a sliced onion has 
been boiled, and set over the fire to cook. Heat in another 
saucepan a cup of milk (not forgetting the pinch of soda). 



12 SOUPS 

When boiling stir into it a tablespoonful of butter, rubbed 
smooth with a teaspoonful of flour. Add half a cupful of 
bread dust, already soaked soft in the same quantity of cold 
milk. Beat well together over the fire with a raw egg 
whipped light, pour into a tureen, turn in upon it, stirring 
all the while, the boiling fish and water. As soon as it is 
thoroughly mixed send to the table. 

CORN SOUP. 

Half a can of cornlet, one teaspoonful of chopped onion, 
half a pint of water, one heaping tablespoonful of flour, one 
pint of milk, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one pinch of white pepper, yolk of one egg. Cook the 
cornlet with cold Avater fifteen minutes ; cook the onion in 
the melted butter until a light brown, add flour, seasoning, 
and the milk gradually, then add the cornlet. Strain and re- 
peat. Beat the yolk of one egg, and put it in the soup tureen, 
pour the soup slowly over the egg, mix well, and serve im- 
mediately. The egg may be omitted. Corn may be chopped 
fine and used instead of cornlet. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Half a pint or half a can of peas, one pint of water, one 
tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, a pinch of 
salt, a pinch of white pepper, half a teaspoonful of sugar, half 
a pint of milk or cream. Wash the peas and cook them in one 
pint of boiling water until soft, mash them with the water in 
which they were cooked, strain, and add the remainder of the 
liquid. Make a white sauce and cook until it is like thick 
cream. If the peas are fresh some of the pods may be cooked 
with them. 



SOUPS 13 

SPLIT PEA SOUP. 

Half a cupful of split peas, one and one-half quarts of 
water, one tablespoonful of chopped onion, one heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a pinch of pepper, one and one-half cupfuls of 
milk. Wash the peas and soak them over night in one pint of 
cold water. In the morning drain and rinse thoroughly, add 
quart and a half of cold water and the chopped onion. Cook 
slowly until soft, rub through a strainer. Make a white sauce, 
add this liquid to it and cook until it is of the proper consis- 
tency. Cooking a small ham bone Avith the peas improves the , 
flavor.

FISH. 

In selecting fish, choose those only in which the eye is full 
and prominent, the flesh firm and thick, the scales bright and 
stiff. Fish should be cleaned thoroughly before cooking. 



COOKING IN DEEP FAT. 
GENERAL RULES. 

The fat used for cooking may be olive oil, cottonseed oil, 
cottolene, beef drippings, lard, or a mixture of several fats. 

The food must be covered with crumbs and egg, or a 
batter, to keep it from absorbing fat. 

Place the articles to be cooked in a bath of fat, deep enough 
to float them. The kettle should be of iron ; a frying basket 
may be used. 

Foods already cooked or needing little cooking, require a 
higher temperature than batters. The temperature of the fat 
for oysters, croquettes, fish-balls, etc., may be tested by 
browning a cube of bread while counting forty. Counting 
sixty while the bread browns gives the right temperature for 
all batters. 



i6 FISH 

All the articles cooked must be drained on unglazed brown 
paper. 

When one quantity of food has been taken from the fat, 
it must be reheated and tested before adding a second set. 

In the absence of a frying basket, a wire spoon may be 
used to remove the food from the fat. 

Fat which has been used for frying, should be cooled and 
clarified by cooking a few slices of raw potato in it for ten 
minutes ; strain through muslin, and when cold cover. Fat 
may be used several times for frying and then may be made 
into soap. 



CLARIFIED FAT. 

Remove the tough outside skin and lean parts from beef fat 
(cod fat or suet), or pork fat, and cut the fat into small pieces. 
Put it into a saucepan and cover it with cold water. Place 
it on the stove uncovered, so that the steam may carry off the 
impurities. When the water has nearly all evaporated set the 
kettle back and let the fat slowly try out. When the fat is 
still and the scraps of skin are shriveled at the bottom of the 
kettle, strain the fat through a cloth and set it away to cool. 



BAKED SHAD. 

Get a small shad, stuff it with bread crumbs, salt, pepper, 
butter and parsley minced, and mix well with yolk of on'* 
small egg, beaten. Fill the fish with this dressing and sew it 
up or fasten a string around. Pour over it a little boiling 
water and some butter, or lay strips of bacon on the fish, and 
bake as you would a fowl. Garnish with parsley and lemon. 



FISH 17 

DRESSING FOR BAKED SHAD. 

Boil up some of the gravy in which the shad was baked; 
put in a teaspoonful of catsup, a teaspoonful of browned flour 
which has been wet with cold water, juice of half a lemon, and 
half a wineglassful of cherry wine. Serve in a gravy boat 

SHAD ROE. 

Wipe the roe with a bit of cloth until dry; rub over it 
olive oil or melted butter; boil five minutes until well 
browned. It should be well cooked and of a light brown color 
when done ; it is better to put the roe in salted water ; the next 
day boil it as above. Cut it open ; dip in flour and frv in hot 
pork fat. 

BAKED WHITE FISH. 

Thoroughly clean the fish ; cut off the head or not, as pre- 
ferred. Cut out the backbone from the head to within two 
inches of the tail, and stuff with the following: Soak stale 
bread in water, squeeze dry; cut in pieces a large onion, fry 
in butter, chop fine. Add the bread, two ounces of butter, 
salt, pepper and a little parsley or sage. Heat through, and 
when taken off the fire, add the yolks of two well-beaten eggs ; 
stuff the fish rather full, sew up with fine twine, and wrap 
with several coils of white tape. Rub the fish over slightly 
with butter, just cover the bottom of a baking pan with hot 
water, and place the fish in it, standing back upward, and 
bent in the form of an S. Serve with the following dressing: 
Reduce the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs to a smooth paste 
with two tablespoonfuls of good salad oil; stir in half a tea- 
spoonful of Engli;,h mustard, and add pepper and vinegar to 
taste. 



i8 FISH 

FISH COOKED IN WATER. 

Steam fish over gently boiling water, or place it in a piece 
of muslin, sew or tie the edges together and put the fish into 
boiling water, boil five minutes, then add one tablespoonful 
of salt and cook at a lower temperature until done. Serve 
with a sauce. 

FISH COOKED IN FAT. 

Season with salt and pepper and cover with equal amounts 
of corn meal and flour, or crumbs and egg. Cook in deep fat 
or saute. Drain on paper. 

STUFFING FOR FISH. 

Two cupfuls of bread crumbs, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful of white pepper, cayenne, one tea- 
spoonful onion juice, one teaspoonful chopped parsley, one 
teaspoonful capers or chopped pickle, one-fourth cupful melt- 
ed butter. Mix in the order given. 

FRESH STURGEON STEAK. 

Take one slice of sturgeon two inches thick, let it stand in 
hot water five minutes. Drain, put in a bowl and add a gill of 
vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a saltspoonful of black pepper and the juice of half 
a lemon. Let it stand six hours, turning it occasionally. 
Drain and dry on a napkin, dip in egg, roll in bread crumbs 
and fry, or rather boil, in very hot fat. Beat up the yolks of 
two raw eggs, add a teaspoonful of French mustard, and, by 
degrees, half of the marinade, to make a smooth sauce, which 
.serve with the fish. 



FISH 19 

TO BROIL MACKEREL. 

Grease a broiler well ; place the fish over a good fire ; brown 
on both sides ; place on platter and season with a little butter 
and pepper; or place the fish in a buttered dripping pan, skin 
side down, baking a nice brown ; this may be best in the above 
manner and add a few spoonfuls of rich cream. 

BROILED FRESH MACKEREL. 

When cleaned, wash and wipe dry. Split open, lay on 
buttered gridiron over a clear fire ; sprinkle with salt and when 
brown turn the other side till quite brown. Place on hot 
dish with plenty of melted butter, and one tablespoonful 
cream. Serve immediately. 

BROILED SPANISH MACKEREL. 

Open the fish down the back and remove back bone ; dry 
the fish well with a towel after washing it ; salt it, and put on 
a gridrion over a clear fire, turning the flesh side down until it 
is brown, then turn it over; serve with melted butter and 
sliced lemon. 

FINNAN HADDIE BROILED. 

Wash well, soak half an hour in cold water; then for five 
minutes in very hot water. Wipe, rub with butter, and broil 
for fifteen minutes on brisk coals. 

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE. 

GOOD WITH BOILED FISH. 

Beat one-half teacupful of butter to a cream ; add the yolks 
of two eggs, juice of half a lemon, salt and a very little cay- 



20 , FISH 

enne pepper. Put into vessel or a saucepan boiling water. 
Beat with an egg beater until it begins to thicken, then add 
a half-cup of boiling water, beating continually. When of 
consistency of thick custard it is done. It will require five 
or seven minutes to cook, if water boils hard. 

SALMON IN A MOULD. 

One small can of salmon, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, one quarter cupful of bread crumbs, salt and 
pepper, and one sprig of minced parsley. Rub the butter in 
the salmon, put the crumbs in the beaten eggs. Mix all thor- 
oughly and add seasoning. Put into a buttered mould and 
steam one hour. 

Sauce. — One-half cupful of hot milk thickened with one 
teaspoonful of corn starch; add one heaping teaspoonful of 
butter, liquor from the salmon, one egg, one tablespoonful of 
tomato catsup. Put the egg in last and very carefully. 

OYSTERS AND MUSHROOMS. 

Parboil one-half pint of oysters, strain and save the liquor. 
Cut the oysters fine and mix with half a can of chopped 
mushrooms. Mix the oyster liquor and mushroom juice with 
cream enough to make one pint; thicken with one tablespoon- 
ful of butter and three tablespoonfuls of flour. Season with 
salt, cayenne, and lemon juice. Add the oysters and the 
mushrooms and serve on toast. 

To make icecups for oysters, fill baking powder cans half 
full of water and let them freeze. When you wish to use 
them, turn the frozen mould out on a plate, make a depres- 
sion with a warm poker large enough to hold four or five oys- 
ters. 



FISH 21 

OYSTER COCKTAILS. 

To a glass, six small blue points, two teaspoonfuls of lemon 
juice, one teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, two table- 
spoonfuls of catsup, a tiny pinch of salt, and a pinch of sugar. 
Serve cold in a sherbet cup or cocktail glass, 

BAKED SALMON. 

Open a can of salmon, add two well beaten eggs, one-half 
cup milk, four soda crackers broken in small pieces, pepper 
and salt. Pour into buttered granite pan and bake a light 
brown. 

OYSTER PIES. 

For each pie an individual tin pie-plate; butter and cover 
the bottom with a puff paste, as for pies. Lay on it six select 
oysters, or enough to cover the bottom ; drop in bits of but- 
ter and season with a pinch of salt and plenty of pepper; 
spread over this an egg batter and cover with a crust of the 
paste, making small openings in it with a fork. Bake in a 
hot oven until the top is nicely browned. 

OYSTERS STEAMED. 

Wash and drain half a pint of counts ; put them in a shal- 
low pan and place in a steamer over boiling water. Steam 
until they are plump with the edges ruffled. Place in a heat- 
ed dish, season with butter, salt and pepper and serve. 

GRANDMOTHER'S SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

A layer of rolled crackers in the bottom of a well buttered 
pudding dish, and a layer of oysters drained ; season with salt, 



22 FISH 

and pepper and bits of butter. Continue this way until the 
dish is full. Then pour over one large cupful of milk. Bake 
three-quarters of an hour. 

LITTLE PIGS IN BLANKETS. 

Roll each nice plump oyster in a very thin slice of bacon ; 
pin with a toothpick ; fry until bacon is brown ; serve on very 
hot dish. 

TURBOT. 

One pint of milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, cooked together ; season with salt and pep- 
per, one teaspoonful of onion juice, and one sprig of minced 
parsley. Place in a baking dish a layer of shredded fish and 
the sauce alternately ; sprinkle Vv^ith bread crumbs and brown 
in a moderate oven. 

EGG SAUCE. 

One cup cream sauce or drawn butter, three hard boiled 
eggs ; chop whites fine and add to sauce ; grate yolks over 
sauce, or the yolks may be chopped by themselves, or rubbed 
through a sieve. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Select large oysters, wash and wipe them, remove pieces of 
shell, season with salt and pepper, roll in fine bread crumbs 
which have been dried, sifted, and seasoned, dip in beaten 
egg and again in crumbs. The egg should have one table- 
spoonful of water or oyster juice added to it. Fry one minute, 
drain, garnish and serve. 



FISH 23 

GRANDMOTHER'S CODFISH BALLS. 

Place a half cupful of the fish in cold water on the back 
of the stove ; when the water is hot pour off, and add more 
cold water until fish is fresh enough. Then pick it up. Boil 
and mash a few potatoes, mix fish and potatoes together while 
potatoes are hot, taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third 
fish. Use plenty of butter. Make into balls and fry in plenty 
of hot lard. Be sure to have the lard hot before putting in the 
balls. 

FISH BALLS. 

One-half cupful salt codfish, one and one-quarter cups 
of potatoes, one egg, one-half tablespoonful butter, one-eighth 
teaspoonful pepper. Wash the fish in cold water and break 
into small pieces ; wash and pare the potatoes and cut in 
pieces. Cook the fish and potatoes together in boiling water 
until the potatoes are soft, drain and shake over the fire 
until dry; mash with a wire potato masher, add the beaten 
egg, butter and pepper, add more salt if needed and beat 
until light. Take up the moisture by spoonfuls, mould slight- 
ly, and slip them into the fat. Fry one minute, or until 
brown. 

TO FRY FISH. 

Clean the fish, wipe dry, rub a little salt inside and sprinkle 
with a little pepper after putting them in the pan, but never 
roll them in the flour ; it is not necessary and does not improve 
them. Never allow fish to soak in the fat. The fat should be 
perfectly hot when the fish is put in and kept at the same tem- 
perature throughout the cooking. Fish may be fried in lard, 
butter or clarified dripping, but I prefer the latter, or, what 



24 FISH 

is better, the fat obtained by frying thin slices of salt pork, the 
quantity required depending- upon the size and number of the 
fish, but a generous quantity is desirable. If a piece of bread 
dropped into the fat will instantly brown, it will be hot enough 
to put the fish in. All small fish are better fried. 

TRIPE LYONS FASHION. 

Cut one pound of cold cooked tripe into thin slices about 
an inch square and wipe very dry. Mince two onions and 
put them with three ounces of butter in a frying pan and 
brown slowly ; when about half done put in the tripe and let 
fry for ten minutes ; season with salt and pepper and three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Serve very hot. Oysters may be 
added to this dish ; cooking them only long enough to plump 
them. 

SHRED CODFISH. 

Flake very fine a half pound of very white, sweet codfish. 
Wash in two waters and squeeze as tight as possible. Put 
into a saucepan with a piece of butter as large as an egg, and 
two heaping spoonfuls sifted flour. Mix the butter, flour and 
fish thoroughly together, add very slowly two or three cupfuls 
boiling water, let come to a boil and serve. Add, if you 
choose, just before removing from the stove, an egg well 
beaten. A garnish of hard-boiled eggs is considered an im- 
provement by some. 

BROILED MACKEREL (FRESH). 

Remove head and the dark skin from inside the fish, wash 
thoroughly and wipe dry. Butter the bars of the gridiron 
and broil the fish over a clear fire. When done, dip quickly 



FISH. 25 

into hot water, and serve with a dressing made as for broiled 
salt mackerel. Slit the fish before broiling, so that when laid 
flat the backbone will be in the middle. 

SAUCE FOR BROILED FISH. 

Put a heaping tablespoonful of butter into a half cupful of 
cream, keep it hot, stir often, and when the fish is dished, 
turn the sauce over the fish and serve. 

SAUCE TO SERVE WITH BAKED FISH. 

Put into a double boiler one teaspoonful of butter. Beat 
into it the 5^olk of one egg, a pinch of salt and cayenne pep- 
per, two tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and one teaspoonful 
of cider vinegar. Cook and stir until it is a little thick and 
add three drops of lemon juice. Keep very hot and closely 
covered. Serve a small portion with each plate of fish.

MEATS AND SAUCES 27 



MEATS AND SAUCES 



MEATS AND SAUCES. 

In the selection of meat one should make it a point to un- 
derstand how to buy meat. Beef should be smooth, fine 
grained, and a clear bright red, and should feel tender when 
pinched. The best pieces for roasting are the middle ribs 
and sirloin. 

Veal should be firm and dry, fine grained and a pale pink 
color. 

Pork should be young and break on being pinched. If 
the rind is tough and hard it is old. 

In roasting meat allow fifteen minutes to the pound, and 
above all things have the oven hot before putting roast in. 

It is a difficult matter to get roasts small enough for two 
people. An ordinary roast lasts quite too long to be enjoyable 
even though it can be used in various ways; as sliced cold 
meat; cut up in squares and warmed in the gravy and called 
"fricassee"; meat pie, croquettes, hash or hash on toast. 

ROAST BEEF. 

Get a rib piece or loin roast of four or five pounds, wipe 
it clean with a clean wet towel, baste it well with suet fat and 



28 MEATS AND SAUCES 

sprinkle with flour ; lay it in pan, set in oven, baste often with 
its own drippings; when partly done sprinkle with salt and 
pepper; let it roast an hour and a quarter in a hot oven. Be 
sure that your oven is good and hot when you set the roast in. 
When done remove the roast to a heated dish, set in warm 
place; skim all fat from the drippings with a spoon or brown 
paper; add two teaspoonfuls of sifted flour, pepper and salt, 
and a half teacup of boiling water; boil up once and serve in 
gravy boat. 

ROAST BEEF. 

The smallest roast from the rib after it is rolled weighs 
from three to four pounds. Place in a dripping pan with a 
very little water in the bottom. Dredge with flour and put 
in a hot oven and bake according to the rules above, occasion- 
ally basting with the juices from the bottom of the pan, and 
when about half done plentifully salting. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 

Get a small pot roast from the rump and brown in an iron 
kettle before pouring water in and cooking. Boil very slow- 
ly till quite tender. Do not salt it till it is nearly done. 

ROUND STEAK FRENCH ROASTED. 

Get two pounds of choice round steak cut thick. Cut it 
into pieces about five inches square, put into an iron kettle and 
brown, being careful not to scorch it. Then pour in a little 
water and an onion cut in small pieces and let all stew slowly, 
renewing water when it boils away, until it is tender enough to 
cut with a fork. Brown flour by scorching it in a tin plate

on top of the stove and mix with a little cold water till free 
from lumps and use to thicken the gravy. 

ROAST VEAL. 

A small roast of veal from the loin is choicest, but a should- 
er roast with a pocket for stuffing is also good. A two pound 
roast can be bought but from three to three and a half pounds 
is the best size. Bake till tender, basting when necessary. 

ROAST LAMB. 

A leg of lamb is too large for a small family unless it is real 
milk lamb, when it should be carefully roasted as it cooks 
quickly. Get a two pound piece of the shoulder of young 
lamb and ask the butcher to fix a pocket for stuffing. This is 
a very delicious roast. 

ROAST SPARE RIB WITH DRESSING. 

Have loin of pork cut with long ribs; season and put to 
roast; half an hour before it is done turn so the ribs will hold 
the dressing made as for turkey stuffing; fill with the dressing 
and finish baking; serve with apple sauce. 

MINCED MUTTON AND EGGS. 

Chop remnants of cold mutton, season well and add a good 
cupful of warmed gravy. Strew crumbs on the bottom of a 
buttered baking dish, pour in the mutton and cover with 
crumbs, and bake till bubbling hot; then break eggs enough 
over the top to cover the mince well, scatter bits of butter on 
the eggs, salt, pepper, and sift cracker crumbs over the top, 
and bake till the eggs are set.

or stringy pieces ; mince it very fine. Mince one small onion 
and mix well with the meat. Season with salt and pepper, and 
make into cakes the size of a biscuit and quite flat. Have 
ready a frying pan with a teaspoonful of lard and one table- 
spoonful of butter and let it get boiling hot, then put in the 
steak and fry a nice brown on both sides. Garnish with pars- 
ley around the edge of the platter and slices of lemon on top 
of the meat. 

TRIPE LYONNAISE. 

Cut up half a pound of cold boiled tripe into squares. Put 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and one tablespoonful of chopped 
onion in a frying pan and fry brown ; add to this a tablespoon- 
ful of strong vinegar, salt and cayenne. Stir to prevent burn- 
ing. Cover the bottom of a heated platter with tomato sauce, 
add the contents and serve hot. 

ROAST PORK. 

Ask for a four pound rib roast. Wash well and rub sur- 
face with plenty of salt and sprinkle lightly with pepper and 
sage. Dredge with flour and bake in a hot oven for the first

spoonful of baking soda and skim off the froth. Drain and 
pour beans in an earthen covered pot. Put in the center of the 
beans a quarter of pound of salt pork ; score the rind in slices. 
Mix one pint of boiling water with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
one pinch of cayenne pepper, one tablespoonful of molasses. 
Pour this over the beans, set in a moderate oven, and bake for 
four hours, keeping the pot well covered. About an hour be- 
fore the beans are done, remove the cover to brown the top 
and crisp the pork. When done, if beans are just right, 
the juice will show itself when the pot is tilted half way 
up. Serve in a deep dish, the pork on top, garnished with a 
few sprigs of parsley. 

BREADED TONGUE.

onion into slices and add it to the water in which the meat is 
boiling, together with a bay leaf, four cloves, six pepper corns, 
a half stick of celery, and a half inch of stick cinnamon. Place 
the meat in a deep platter when it is done, and spread it thin- 
ly with grated horseradish. Strain the liquor remaining in the 
kettle and make a browm sauce to pour over the meat. Dump- 
lings are very nice served with a pot roast. 

LIVER A LA CREME. 

Get one pound of calf's liver. Wash and boil till very 
tender in salted water. Drain and chop fine. Make a cream

tablespoonfuls of carrots cut in dice, a quarter of a cup of 
turnips cut in dice, two potatoes cut in one-half inch slices, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of pepper, a quarter of a cup

best pieces of meat. Put the rest of the meat and the bone into 
cold water and soak for one hour, then heat until it bubbles. 
Season the one-half cup of meat and roll it in the flour. Melt 
the fat in a frying-pan, remove the scraps. Brown the sliced 
onion and then the floured meat in the hot fat, add both to the 
stew and cook for one hour and a half at a low temperature.

pickles. Put these in a small stewpan with half a cup of 
vinegar, one teaspoonful of bread crumbs, a pinch of salt and 
pepper. Boil all together five minutes, then add one gill of

crumbs, small onion. Boil these together ten minutes. Take 
out the onion, season with one tablespoonful butter, salt, 
white pepper, to taste, and a suspicion of nutmeg or mace. 
Serve at once. 

ROAST PORK. 

The loin or chine, also the spareribs, are the best pieces for 
roasting. Rub surface well with salt, sprinkle lightly with 
sage and pepper, dredge with flour, and bake in a hot oven 
for the first twenty minutes, or until delicately browned, after 
which reduce the heat, allowing twenty minutes to each pound 
of meat. Baste often. Roast pork should be thoroughly 
cooked, not at so high a temperature as other meats, and is 
considered more wholesome when served cold. Serve with 
onion sauce, when served hot, and with baked, fried or stewed 
apples. 

SAUSAGE WITH APPLE GARNISH. 

Always buy the best sausages, as pork which is not of the 
best quality is not desirable or healthful. Two grades of 
seasoning are sometimes offered at the same price, one mild 
and the other highly spiced. Try baking instead of frying 



MEATS AND SAUCES 39 

sausage and you will never go back to the top of the stove 
method. Arrange the sausages on a baking sheet, pierce 
each a half dozen times with a steel fork and set in the oven ; 
turn once to brown and when they are done they will be 
cooked evenly and unbroken. While any kind of pork should 
be well done, it should not be cooked until dry as a chip, 
as it is sometimes served. Pile the sausages on a platter in 
log cabin style and garnish with apples which have been 
cut in round slices, cored and pared and cooked in a weak 
syrup until tender but not broken. The sausage needs the 
acid of the apple to counteract its own richness in fat and 
spices, and if more convenient, serve stewed apple with it. 
Do not choke the sausage in a frying pan and then turn the 
apple in to absorb the grease as it cooks, unless the family 
have digestions of wood choppers in midwinter. 

COTTAGE PIE. 

Mince two cupfuls cold meat (any kind will answer), add 
to it one minced onion, one teaspoonful powdered sage and 
salt and pepper to taste. Turn all into a pie dish, add a little 
hot water and cover with a deep layer of mashed potatoes 
beaten light, with cream and seasoning added. A little sweet 
cream added to the meat is an improvement. Spread a little 
soft butter over the potatoes, and bake half an hour.

BEEF A LA BARCELONA. 

Cut a pound of tender beef into small bits. Fry in butter, 
with a minced onion, a little celery or celery seed, some 
chopped parsley and a pinch of thyme. When brown, add 
enough stock to cover, using beef extract and water if stock 
is not at hand. Simmer slowly till the meat is cooked 
through, then add a spoonful of white wine. Make a mound 
of boiled rice in the center of the platter, arrange the meat 
around it, strain the sauce, thicken, and pour over it. 

DRIED BEEF A LA CREME. 

Make a cream sauce and add to it the dried beef, cut fine. 
Season with pepper but not salt. When hot, add a well-beaten 
egg, stir till it thickens and serve at once on toast. A very 
nice breakfast dish. 

ROAST "SPAR'RIB." 

Select carefully the loin and ribs of a "beastie" both fresh

the pan. It should be roasted the day before, as it is much 
more wholesome when cold and is intended as a relish to 
turkey. 

LIVER PATTIES. 

Take one-half pound of calf liver, steamed or boiled and 
chopped fine, season with salt, pepper, catsup and Worcester- 
shire sauce to taste, adding a little thick brown sauce. Serve 
in hot patty shells. 

HOT TONGUE WITH TARTARE SAUCE. 

Note — This meat is nice for company dinner, as it requires

the tongue out and peel it. Return to the hot liquid until 
ready to serve.

olives, chopped, to salad dressing No. i. Add no cream. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

One large tablespoonful of butter, one rounded tablespoon- 
ful of flour, one level teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful of white pepper. Stir these together and pour over the 
mixture one-half pint of hot milk. Cook just long enough to 
thoroughly mix the ingredients, — two or three minutes.

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Have a bright, clear and steady fire for roasting. Pre- 
pare your chicken. Make a dressing of bread crumbs, onion 
chopped fine, butter, pepper and salt, and one-half cup of 
raisins, if liked. Put a pint of hot water in the dripping-pan, 
add to it a small tablespoonful of salt and a small teaspoonful 
of pepper. Baste frequently and let it roast quickly without 
scorching. When nearly done add a piece of butter the size 
of a large egg to the water in the pan; when it melts baste 
with it, dredge with flour, baste again and let it finish. From 
three-quarters to one hour will roast if the fire is right. When 
done take it up, let the giblets (heart, liver and gizzard) boil 
tender and chop fine. Put them in the gravy. Add a table- 
spoonful of browned flour and a bit of butter. Stir it over the 
fire for a few minutes, then serve in a gravy tureen. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH OYSTER DRESSING. 

Dress and rub the turkey thoroughly both inside and out 
with salt and pepper ; steam two hours, or until it begins to 
grow tender, lifting the cover occasionally and sprinkling with 
salt. Then take out, loosen the legs, and rub the inside again

with salt and pepper and stuff with a dressing prepared as 
follows : Take a loaf of stale bread, cut off the crust and 
soften by placing in a pan, pouring on boiling water, draining 
off immediately and covering closely ; crumble the bread fine, 
add half a pound of melted butter, or more if to be very rich, 
and a teaspoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper, or 
enough to season rather highly ; drain off liquid from a quart 
of oysters, bring to a boil, skim and pour over the bread 
crumbs, adding the soaked crusts and one or two eggs. Mix 
all thoroughly with the hand, and if rather dry moisten with 
a little sweet milk; lastly, add the oysters, being careful not 
to break them ; or first put in a spoonful of stuffing, and then 
three or four oysters and so on, until the turkey is filled ; stuff" 
the breast first. Flour a cloth and place over the openings, 
tying it down with a twine ; spread the turkey over with but- 
ter, salt and pepper. Place in a dripping-pan in a well-heated 
oven, add half a pint of hot water, and roast two hours, bast- 
ing often with a little water, butter, salt and pepper, kept in 
a tin for this purpose and placed on the back of the stove. A 
swab made of a stick with a cloth tied on the end is better 
than a spoon to baste with. Turn until nicely browned on all 
sides, and about half an hour before it is done baste with but- 
ter and dredge with a little flour. This will give it a frothy 
appearance. When you dish the turkey, if there is much fat 
in the pan, pour off most of it and add the chopped giblets 
previously cooked until tender, and the water in which they 
were cooked ; now stew down to about one pint ; place one or 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour (it is better to have half 
of it browned) in a pint bowl, mix smooth with a little cream, 
fill up bowl with cream or rich milk, and add to the gravy in 
the pan. Boil several minutes, stirring constantly, and pour 
into the gravy tureen. Serve with currant or apple jelly. A

turkey steamed in this way does not look so well on the table, 
but is very tender and palatable. It is an excellent way to 
cook a large turkey. 

BONED TURKEY. 

With a sharp knife slit the skin down the back, and, rais- 
ing one side at a time with the lingers, separate the flesh from 
the bones with a knife until the wings and legs are reached. 
Then unjoint from the body, and cutting through to the bone, 
turn back the flesh and remove the bones. When the bones 
are removed the flesh may be reshaped by stuffing. Some 
leave the bones in the legs and wings, as they are the most 
difficult to remove. Stuff with force meat made of cold lamb 
or veal and a little pork chopped fine and seasoned with salt, 
pepper, sage or savory, and the juice of one lemon. Sew into 
shape, turn ends of wings under and press the legs close to the 
back, and tie firmly so that the upper surface may be plump 
and smooth for the carver. Lard with two or three rows on 
the top, and bake until thoroughly done, basting often with 
salt and water and a little butter. Carve across in slices and 
serve with tomato sauce or meat jelly for boned turkey. 

MEAT JELLY FOR BONED TURKEY. 

Take oil from the water (when cold) in which the turkey 
was boiled, strain into a porcelain kettle, add two ounces of 
gelatine, three eggs with shells, a wineglassful of sherry or 
Madeira; stir well. Add one quart of strained liquor, beat 
rapidly with an egg beater, put over the fire and stir till it 
boils ; simmer ten or fifteen minutes, sprinkle with a pinch of 
turmeric and strain as other jelly. Add lemon juice to taste. 
When cold break up and place over and around turkey. Cut 
in thick slices and fanciful shapes with paste cutter.

PRAIRIE CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken up as for fricassee, put in a dripping-pan 
with plenty of butter, sprinkle with flour, pepper and salt. 
When it begins to brown add a little water, adding more from 
time to time, turn occasionally, and bake about an hour. A 
nice gravy to serve with this can be made by adding more 
flour to drippings when the chicken is taken up and thinning 
with rich milk or cream. 

FRIED SPRING CHICKEN. 

Clean and joint the chicken, then soak in salt water for 
an hour. Have a frying pan ready with equal p^rts of lard

cleaned, with pepper and a teaspoonful of salt, wrap the 
chicken in a clean white cloth, place in a steamer as near the 
water as possible, cover, and steam two hours. Serve with 
a cream sauce or gravy. Boil two cupfuls of the liquor from 
the kettle without the fat, add a pinch of cayenne pepper and 
two pinches of salt. Stir two tablespoonfuls of flour into one 
cupful of sweet cream until smooth, then mix with the gravy. 
Add one pinch of nutmeg, with one teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. Garnish with celery and thin slices of lemon. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

A half cupful of minced chicken, add salt and pepper to 
taste, and enough gravy thickened with flour to mould into 
egg-shaped rolls. Sprinkle well with bread crumbs, and

dish. When a nice brown, remove croquettes to a hot dish. 
Add to the butter left in the pan one teaspoonful of soaked 
bread crumbs and four tablespoonfuls of heated milk, boil 
until thick enough to spread evenly, add the seasoning you 
like. Serve with a sprig of celery on each croquette, and 
serve at once.

Wash and dry the duck carefully. Make a stuffing of 
bread, onion, pepper, salt and butter; insert, and sew up com- 
pletely that the seasoning may not escape. If tender, ducks 
do not require more than an hour to roast ; keep them well 
basted, and a few minutes before serving dredge lightly with 
flour to make them froth and look plump. Send to the table 
hot, with a good brown gravy poured, not around, but over

CANDIED SWEET POTATOES. 

Boil sweet potatoes until just done. Peel and lay them in 
a shallow pan. Sprinkle them with brown sugar and bits of 
butter. Put the pan in the oven and let the potatoes slightly 
brown. 

SNOW POTATOES. 

Boil and mash the potatoes. Season with butter, pepper, 
salt and cream. Then run them through the potato ricer. 

RICE CROQUETTES. 

One-half cup rice, three-fourths teaspoonful salt ; cook until 
tender and dry. While still lukewarm add to each cup of 
boiled rice one-half egg, a speck of white pepper and a bit of 
butter. Mould and set away to cool. Roll in egg, then in fine 
bread crumbs and fry in deep fat one minute. Make in shape 
of pyramid. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS CREAMED. 

Wash and throw a cupful of sprouts into water. Simmer 
until tender, which takes about three-quarters of an hour. 
Drain off the water and pour over them a cream sauce. 



56 VEGETABLES 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Bake four medium sized potatoes. When done, cut length- 
wise in half, scoop out the inside, mixing it with butter, pep- 
per, salt and two tablespoonfuls of cream ; beat until light, re- 
turn to the shell of the potato. Place them again in the oven 
until ready to serve, 

SPRING VEGETABLES. 

The tender rhubarb which is one of spring's first offer- 
ings, goes very well with roast lamb or any other meat course 
for dinner. It is much more delicious if cooked without water, 
as the stem itself contains plenty of juice. Peel the stalks, 
cut them into pieces an inch long and put them into the upper 
part of a double boiler with sugar. Since it is to be served 
as a vegetable it will not need so much sugar as when used as 
a sauce, a half cupful being sufficient. 

Dandelion greens is usually the first delicacy of the sea- 
son for the women in the country. To avoid bitter taste the 
leaves must be parboiled in hot water and rinsed in cold water 
after each draining. Then they are boiled for fifteen minutes, 
or until tender. Drain them, run cold water over them and 
chop them fine. Just before serving, heat them in a frying 
pan with a little butter, salt and pepper. Send them to the 
table with the top garnished with hard-boiled eggs. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Asparagus is another of the early spring vegetables, and 
to this plant has been ascribed many medicinal qualities. The 
wise housewife never throws away the tough lower ends of 
the stalks, but cuts them up into short lengths, stewing them 



VEGETABLES 57 

tender, and saves the juice to flavor her next soup. To bake 
the asparagus, cut the tender ends of the stalks into inch-long 
pieces and cook them about fifteen minutes. Drain them and 
save the water in which they are cooked for the soup kettle. 
Arrange the asparagus in alternate layers, in a buttered 
baking dish, with fine bread crumbs, bits of butter, salt and 
pepper and dice-shaped pieces of hard-boiled eggs. Sprinkle 
the top of the dish with buttered crumbs and bake twenty-five 
minutes. Send to the table in a baking dish. 

BAKED CABBAGES. 

Get a small firm white cabbage, clean and boil for fifteen 
minutes, then change the water and add more boiling water. 
When the cabbage is very tender drain and set aside to cool. 
When it is perfectly cold, chop fine and add two well beaten 
eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, and 
three tablespoonfuls of cream. Stir all well together, and 
bake in a well buttered pudding dish until brown. Serve 
very hot. This dish is very digestible. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 

Boil tender four parsnips, scrape and slice lengthwise. 
Put in a saucepan, add two teaspoonfuls of butter, salt and 
pepper, and a little minced parsley. Shake until the mixture 
boils. Dish the parsnips, add to the sauce two tablespoonfuls 
of sweet cream in which has been stirred a teaspoonful of 
flour. Let come to a boil and pour over the parsnips. Serve 
hot. 

BOILED ONIONS. 
Select as many onions as required. (The white silver 



58 VEGETABLES 

skins are the best species). Peel off the outside and cut off 
the ends, and put in cold water in a stewpan, and let them 
scald three minutes; then turn off the water, pour on cold 
water salted a little and boil slowly until tender, which will 
take about thirty minutes or longer, according to size of 
onions. When tender drain and dry. Pour over them a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and serve. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

Select four nice onions, boil the same as boiled onions. 
When quite done drain off all the water. Add half teacup- 
ful of milk, butter the size of a large walnut, salt and pepper, 
a heaping teaspoonful of flour stirred to a cream with a little 
milk. Let all boil up once and serve in a vegetable dish. 

BAKED ONIONS. 

One large Spanish onion, wash and clean, but do not peel. 
Put into a saucepan with slightly salted water. Boil forty- 
five minutes, replacing with more boiling water as it evap- 
orates. Pour off water and lay the onion on a cloth to dry. 
Roll onion in a buttered tissue paper, twisting it at the top, 
and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour, or until 
tender all through. When tender, peel and place in a small 
deep dish and brown slightly. Baste with melted butter for ten 
minutes, season with salt and pepper, and pour over onion one 
spoonful of melted butter. 

LIMA AND KIDNEY BEANS. 

One-half pint of beans, put them into boiling^water, a 
little more than enough to cover them, and boil till tender. 



VEGETABLES 59 

Serve with butter and salt upon them, or cream them by- 
mixing a teaspoonful of flour with milk till thick, then add a 
little parsley, and stir into the beans, adding a cup of milk. 
This makes a very fine dish. 

BAKED BEETS. 

Wash and clean three or four beets, put into oven and 
bake three-quarters of an hour in a hot oven, turning them

would if a fork were used. When done, remove the skins and 
serve with butter, salt and pepper on the slices. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Get half a peck of peas, shell them and wash in cold water. 
Put into kettle and pour boiling water over them, just enough 
to cover them. Boil twenty-five minutes, at least till the 
liquor is nearly boiled out; season with salt and pepper and 
a tablespoonful of butter. Serve very hot. 

STEWED GREEN PEAS. 

The same amount as above, shell and wash ; put into a 
saucepan with boiling water and boil until very tender. Drain 
in a colander. Melt a heaping teaspoonful of butter in one of 
flour; stir well and add to the peas, and boil eight minutes. 

SCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

Butter the sides of a small pudding-dish, put a layer of 
breadcrumbs in the bottom, on them put a layer of sliced 
tomatoes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, adding bits of but- 
ter and a little white sugar sprinkled over. Repeat until the 



6o VEGETABLES 

pan is full, having the top layer of sliced tomatoes with bits 
of butter on each slice. Bake in a closely covered dish till 
thoroughly cooked through. Remove cover and brown quick- 
ly. Serve hot. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Peel and slice four tomatoes a quarter of an inch thick, 
place in layers in a pudding-dish, seasoning each layer with

and brown ten minutes. Just before serving, pour over the 
top three tablespoonfuls of whipped cream with melted butter. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Select four nice, ripe tomatoes, pour boiling water over 
them and let them remain in the boiling water a few min- 
utes; peel off the skins, put in a graniteware saucepan, and 
stew about twenty minutes; add a heaping teaspoonful of 
butter, salt and pepper, letting them stew ten minutes longer. 
Serve hot. 

CREAMED PARSNIPS. 

Boil a dozen parsnips until tender. Make a drawn butter 
sauce as follows : In a small pan thoroughly mix a table- 
spoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour. Add a 
cupful of hot water and set over hot water until melted. Boil 
up once and pour over parsnips which have been drained. 
Serve very hot. 

GREEN CORN— BOILED. 
Select four nice ears of corn. Strip off the husks and re- 



VEGETABLES 6i 

move all the silk; put into boiling water and boil twenty-five 
minutes. Serve on a heated platter covered over with a large 
table napkin.

Strip off all the husks from the corn and roast on the 
gridiron over a bright fire of coals, turning it as one side is 
done. Serve with salt and butter. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Green corn left over makes a nice lunch dish. Cut the 
corn from the cob. Put into a bowl one-half cupful of corn, 
half cupful of milk, quarter cupful of flour, one small egg, 
pinch of salt, and a quarter of a teaspoonful of butter. Mix 
well into a thick batter, and fry in small cakes in very hot 
butter. Serve with plenty of butter and powdered sugar. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT. 
Get a very small egg plant, cut in two ; scrape out all the 
inside and put into a saucepan with a little minced ham. 
Cover with water and boil till very tender; drain off the 
water; add two heaping teaspoonfuls of grated crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of butter, half a small onion minced ; pinch of 
salt and a dash of pepper. Stuff each half to the hull with the 
mixture. Add a small lump of butter to each and bake fifteen 
minutes. Serve hot. 

FRIED RAW POTATOES. 

Peel six good sized potatoes very evenly and cut them in 
slices as thin as an eggshell. Put into a frying pan one tea- 
spoonful of butter and one of lard, and as soon as it boils add 



62 VEGETABLES 

the sliced potatoes, sprinkling them over with salt and pep- 
per. Cover them with a close-fitting lid, letting the steam 
partly cook them. Remove the lid and then fry gold in color, 
shaking and turning them very carefully with a wooden ladle, 
so as to brown equally and not break the slices. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Take four to five good sized cold-boiled potatoes ; slice 
endwise and crosswise, making them in small squares. Heat 
a tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan ; fry in it half a small 
onion chopped fine, and fried till it changes color, (not a 
brown but a yellow color). Then put in your potatoes, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, stir well with a wooden ladle 
and cook fifteen minutes. Drain dry by shaking in a heated 
colander, taking care not to break them. Serve hot. 

POTATOES A LA MARYLAND.

the baking dish, covering each layer with brown sugar and 
pieces of butter. Bake in a moderate oven till a nice brown. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

Brush clean four good sized sweet potatoes. Bake in a 
hot oven a good half hour, or until they are done. When 
thoroughly baked, they feel soft and yielding when pressed 
with the fingers. Try them often with a fork while baking. 



VEGETABLES 63 

BEETS. 

Wash and cook whole until tender; leave two or three 
inches of the top on until they are cooked. Put in cold water, 
pare, slice, reheat, and add seasoning. They may be served 
cold with vinegar. 

CABBAGE AND CAULIFLOWER. 

Cut cabbage into quarters and soak in cold water one-half 
hour. Chop the leaves, and cook in boiling water until tender. 
Drain and serve with butter, salt and pepper, or with a white 
sauce. Cook cauliflower whole and in a bag to keep its shape. 

SPINACH. 

One-half peck spinach; pick leaves from the stems, and 
wash carefully to remove the sand. Cover and cook until ten- 
der, chop fine or press through a colander; reheat with two 
tablespoonfuls melted butter and seasoning. Serve garnished 
with two hard cooked eggs. Old spinach should be cooked in 
boiling water. 

STEWED POTATOES. 

Slice very thin a heaping cupful of cold baked potatoes; 
dredge with a teaspoonful of flour, a pinch of salt, and sprinkle 
with pepper. Put two teaspoonfuls of butter in a saucepan 
with a half cupful of fresh, rich milk, and when hot add the 
potatoes; stir once, and cook ten minutes withbut further 
stirring. The slices should lie in the gravy unbroken. 

POTATOES BROWNED. 

Take seven potatoes and mash them the same as mashed 
potatoes. Lay into the dish they are to be served in, smooth 



64 VEGETABLES 

over the top and brush over with the yolk of an egg. Set in 
oven to brov^n ; it will brown in ten minutes if the oven is hot. 



POTATO PUFFS. 

Prepare four large potatoes the same as mashed potatoes. 
While hot shape into balls the size of an egg. Have a tin 
dish well buttered and place the balls in it. As soon as they 
are done brush over with beaten egg. Brown in oven. When 
done, slip a knife under them, removing to a hot platter, 
bedded with parsley. Serve at once. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Take seven good sized potatoes ; wash and pare, and lay 
them in cold water thirty minutes; then put them into a 
saucepan, cover with water and a large pinch of salt. Boil 
until thoroughly tender. Drain off the water and mash them 
fine. Have ready a piece of butter the size of an English 
walnut melted in a little hot milk and a pinch of salt. Mix 
this well with the mashed potatoes until they are nice and 
smooth, taking care they are not too wet. Heap them up 
in a vegetable dish, smooth over the top, put a small piece of 
butter on top in the center and have dots of pepper here and 
there. Make it a point always to have your dishes hot and 
serve hot. 

CREAMED ASPARAGUS. 

Cut only the very tender part of the stalks into inch pieces ; 
boil until tender in as little water as can be used and prevent 
burning; drain off the water, season with salt and pepper; 
pour into the cooking dish a cup of thin cream or sweet milk. 



VEGETABLES 65 

and thicken with a tablespoonful of butter rubbed smooth 
with a tablespoonful of flour; boil up until sauce is smooth, 
and serve. 



CREAM OF SPINACH. 

Wash and clean thoroughly half a peck of fresh spinach. 
Throw it into five quarts of salted boiling water in an un- 
covered saucepan, boil for twenty-five minutes. Drain it on 
a colander ; when cool squeeze all the water out of it. It must 
be cooled quickly by pouring cold water over it, for the tin 
of the colander will spoil it. Chop it as fine as possible, then 
put it in a saucepan with one tablespoonful of butter, cook 
slowly for six minutes till dry, stir often. Sprinkle over it 
one teaspoonful of flour and mix well ; add half a pint of rich 
cream. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cook again 
slowlv for ten minutes. Remove from fire and add one table- 
spoonful of butter. Serve in a hot vegetable dish and garnish

CABBAGE SLAW. 

To one cup of cabbage chopped fine, add this dressing: 
Make a dressing with one egg beaten up well, and three table- 
spoonfuls sugar, a pinch of salt, about half a pint of vinegar, 
all beaten well together, then put on fire and cook till it just 
boils, stirring all the time, as it will curdle if too sour. (Add 
a little water to vinegar.) Cool this well, pour over slaw, 
and serve. 

BUTTERED RICE. 

Throw a cupful of raw rice into two quarts of boiling 
water, slightly salted. Boil fast for twenty minutes, or until 
each grain is softened — not broken. Drain in a colander and 
set in open oven to dry while you heat a tablespoonful of but- 
ter in a frying-pan ; drop in a teaspoonful of grated onion, 
stir to a hissing fry. Now turn the dried rice into the hot 
butter, toss lightly for a minute, seasoning to taste with 
pepper and salt, and serve in a deep dish. 

FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Pare and slice, put in salted water; leave in long enough to 
extract all bitterness ; wipe each piece dry. Dip in beaten egg 
and fine crackers, crumbs or corn meal ; sprinkle with a little 
pepper and fry in hot fat ; serve while hot. 

FRIED EGG PLANT. 

Choose medium-sized egg plants ; slice a quarter of an inch 
thick and let stand for a half-hour in cold, salted water; dry 
on a cloth and dip in egg, then in fine crumbs; dip again in 
egg and crumbs and fry a rich brown. They may be peeled 



VEGETABLES 67 

before frying, or after frying the skin readily peels off. Do 
not remove from the salt water until just as you are ready to 
fry, as they turn black quickly. 

FRIED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape roots carefully; boil in salted water until tender. 
Cut into long slices, dredge with flour and fry quite brown 
in butter and dripping mixed. 

STEWED PARSNIPS. 

Scrape roots and slice across; cook in as little water as 
possible, as the sugar of the vegetable goes into the water and 
is thrown away if much water is drained off; watch carefully 
to prevent burning, and when the water is cooked away add 
butter, salt, pepper, and milk enough to cover. Thicken with 
a little flour. 

PARSNIP PATS. 

Boil parsnips until tender enough to press through a sieve. 
Season with salt and pepper, add one beaten egg; form into 
small pats and fry a delicate brown. 

CREAMED TURNIPS. 

Cut turnips into small dice ; boil in salted water, drain, 
pour on milk to cover. Thicken with a little flour, moistened 
with milk. Season with butter, salt and pepper. 

CREAMED CARROTS. 

Slice new carrots and boil until tender in salted water; 
use as little water as possible and prevent burning, so that the 



68 VEGETABLES 

sweetness will remain in the vegetable, and not be thrown 
away in the water. Prepare a cream of two tablespoonfuls 
butter rubbed into two tablespoonfuls flour, and one pint of 
boiling milk or thin cream poured over it. Let all boil up 
once with the carrots. Sprinkle chopped parsley over the dish 
just before sending to the table. 

BAKED SQUASH IN THE SHELL. 

Cut hubbard squash into pieces about four inches square ; 
lay in baking pan, pepper and salt each piece, and put a lump 
of butter in the center of each. Bake until tender and serve 
in the shell just as it comes from the oven. 

TO COOK SUMMER SQUASH. 

Cut the squash in pieces and put in a cheesecloth bag; boil 
in salted water until done. Then remove the bag and hang 
up to drain. When it has drained well put in the colander, 
leaving the bag still closed; with a potato masher press out 
the rest of the juice. Open the bag, turn the squash into a 
basin and mash any remaining lumps. Season with butter, 
pepper and salt, heat, and serve. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Use green peas as soon as possible after picking, as they 
lose their sweetness rapidly. Shell, wash and boil twenty 
minutes, having all the water boil away if possible ; unless the 
peas are very young and tender, it is best to add a teaspoonful 
of sugar to the water in which they are boiled. Season with 
salt, pepper, butter, milk or cream. Heat the milk to the 
boiling point and serve. 



VEGETABLES 69 

CANNED PEAS. 

Drain the peas in a colander and rinse off all the liquor 
with cold water. Put in basin with two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of water, just enough to heat the peas and keep them 
from scorching; when well heated, add a cup of rich milk, but- 
ter, pepper and salt. Let just come to a boil and serve. A 
teaspoonful of sugar added to the peas when boiling is a great 
improvement. A good brand of peas prepared in this way 
will be nearly equal to the fresh vegetable. 

GREEN PEAS WITH NEW POTATOES. 

Cut two thin slices of fat, salt pork into small dice ; fry 
a little in the bottom of kettle in which you are to cook the 
vegetables. Add about a quart of small, new potatoes and a 
pint or more of green peas. Season with salt and pepper ; 
when tender turn off all the water, except about half a cupful. 
Add a cup of milk and thicken with a little flour. 

BEETS. 

Young and tender beets should be chosen. Old beets re- 
quire three or more hours to boil tender. When tender plunge 
for a moment in cold water and the skins will slip off easily. 
Be careful in preparing beets not to cut the skins, as the beets 
bleed and lose their sugar. Slice into dish ; sprinkle each 
layer with salt and pepper. Heat one-half cup water, one-half 
cup vinegar, one tablespoonful sugar and one tablespoonful 
butter, and pour over the sliced beets. 

SPINACH. 

Wash the spinach very carefully through several waters, 
as particles of sand are apt to lodge in the stems near the root. 



70 VEGETABLES 

Cut away the roots before boiling. Boil twenty minutes in as 
little water as can safely be used and not burn. Drain, press 
in the colander to remove all water; chop very fine, season 
with salt, pepper and butter, and g-arnish with hard-boiled 
eggs. 

DANDELION GREENS. 

Wash the greens very carefully in several waters. Boil 
until tender; one-half hour will be sufficient if the greens are 
young and tender. When done, press them as dry as possible 
in a colander. Season with salt and pepper and a little butter; 
garnish the dish with slices of hard boiled eggs. Serve with 
sliced lemon, as the juice is a more pleasant acid than vinegar. 
Only the very young greens should be used. 

FRIED TOMATOES— GREEN OR RIPE. 

Four tomatoes and one cupful of crumbs, one small onion 
chopped fine, salt and pepper. If ripe tomatoes are used, 
choose solid firm ones, not too ripe. Remove skin. If green 
ones, just beginning to ripen, are used, do not pare; cut a thin 
paring from the end and divide into slices about one-half inch 
thick. Prepare the dressing and press it into the tomatoes 
until all the interstices are filled. Fry in drippings a rich 
brown. Serve in hot platter. 

CAULIFLOWER SERVED WHOLE. 

To cook cauliflower and have it remain unbroken, wash 
thoroughly, remove all outer leaves and let it stand flower 
down in a deep dish of water to which a good handful of salt 
has been added. Allow it to remain there three or four hours ; 
then shake it free from the water, tie it in a piece of fine mus-

if separated into the flowerets and boiled until tender, omitting 
the cloth. 



ESCALLOPED CAULIFLOWER. 

One cauliflower, three-quarters cup of milk, one table- 
spoonful butter, two tablespoonfuls bread crumbs, one egg, 
salt and pepper. Boil the cauliflower until tender, about 
twenty minutes. Make a sauce of the butter melted, add milk

EGGS 



BOILED EGGS. 

Three minutes boils eggs soft; six minutes boils eggs so 
yolk is not quite set; ten minutes boils eggs hard; twenty 
or thirty minutes boils eggs so yolks are mealy. They are 
said to be more digestible boiled as long as this, but the yolk 
is apt to darken. To have eggs jellied, put them into boiling 
water and then set dish back on range where the water will 
keep hot but not boil. In ten minutes the eggs will be cooked 
through; the whites will be like a jelly, and not hard as in 
boiled eggs. 

POACHED EGGS. 

Fill basin with boiling salted water, if the bottom of the 
basin is greased first, the eggs will not stick to the dish. 
Break each egg into a saucer, and let slide carefully into the 
basin; keep hot but do not boil the water; when a film of 
white comes over the top, remove eggs to a hot dish; put 
piece butter on each egg; sprinkle with pepper. 

SCALLOPED EGGS. 

Four hard boiled eggs, and half a cup of bread crumbs; 
one-half cup white sauce; slice the eggs in thin rings, cover 



EGGS 75 

the bottom of a buttered baking dish with crumbs, then the 
eggs sprinkled with salt and pepper, cover with sauce and ar- 
range in layers, the same way until the dish is nearly full. 
Cover the top well with crumbs, and brown nicely in a mod- 
erate oven. 

CURRIED EGGS. 

Three hard boiled eggs, two ounces of butter, half of one 
onion and one gill stock, one dessertspoon curry powder, one 
ounce flour, one teaspoonful of cream ; fry onion in butter (an 
apple may be added if desired) then add the flour, stock and 
curry powder; stir gently until flour is cooked; then add the 
cream ; cut the eggs in halves and warm half of the pieces in 
the curry; keep the rest for decorating and dish up prettily 
with curry in the center, and a wall of rice around it. A sprig 
or two of parsley and slices of lemon make it look nice. 

SHIRRED EGGS. 

Separate the number of eggs desired, being careful to pre- 
serve each yolk unbroken in part of its shell; put whites in 
a bowl; beat stiff after salting sufficiently. Butter as many 
gem pans or shirred egg dishes as there were eggs ; dip a 
large spoonful or more of the stiff white into each dish ; drop 
the yolks carefully into the center and bake until the white 
is very lightly browned. A very pretty and dainty way to 
serve eggs. 

CURRIED EGGS. 

Three hard boiled eggs, cut in lengthwise strips; cover 
with the following sauce : one cup of milk and four table- 



76 EGGS 

spoonfuls butter, two tablespoonfuls flour, one-half teaspoon- 
ful curry powder, salt and pepper to taste. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS ON TOAST.

ter sauce to mix well. Grate the hard boiled yolks over, gar- 
nish with parsley and serve. 

EGGS A 'LA ROBERT. 

Peel one medium sized onion and remove the heart ; cut 
the heart into slices and put it with a tablespoonful of butter 
in a saucepan over a brisk fire and brown well ; moisten with 
a half cupful of lean broth ; season with salt and pepper ; cook 
and let the sauce reduce for about ten minutes ; when ready 
to serve cut four hard boiled eggs in slices; mix them in the 
preparation and let heat together, without boiling, for two 
minutes ; add half a teaspoonful of diluted mustard and serve. 

PINK PICKLED EGGS. 

Shell hard boiled eggs and drop them into the vinegar in

ter or olive oil, one tablespponful of vinegar, salt and pepper 
to .taste, and a teaspoonful of made mustard, or one-third tea- 
spoonful dry mustard. Mix to a smooth paste; stuff the 
whites with the mixture; press the halves closely together; 
secure with a wooden toothpick, and lay in a bed of lettuce 
leaves. 

STUFFED EGGS. 

Prepare same as preceding recipe with the addition of 
minced ham, tongue, chicken, or other cold meat. Mustard 
may be omitted if desired, and lemon juice substituted for the 
vinegar. Minced sardines or grated cheese may be used the 
same as any variety of meat; parsley chopped fine, cress, or 
any savory herb may be used for seasoning. Any variety may 
be made with a little practice. 

SCALLOPED EGGS.

is to take round slices of bread, toast them delicately, butter 
them and dip lightly in hot water. On each round spread the 
white of an egg beaten stiff with a speck of salt. Make a de- 
pression in the center, and in each place a whole yolk. Set

MILK BREAD. 

About half past four in the afternoon make a sponge in 
the following way: Pour one and a half cupfuls of boiling 
water on six hops, and when lukewarm, strain and squeeze 
the hops dry. Measure the hop water and add enough more 
water to make one cup and a half. Melt in this hop water 
half a cake of yeast and add three cupfuls of sifted flour. Use 
a three-quart basin; cover tightly, and set in a warm place 
until eight o'clock_, when the sponge should fill the basin about 
two-thirds full. Sift three more cupfuls of flour, add one tea- 
spoonful of salt and one pinch over, and put into a six-quart 
earthenware vessel. Add one teaspoonful of lard and one 
tablespoonful of sugar, and mix. Then pour in the sponge. 
Rinse out the basin with one cupful and a half of rich milk, 
add this to the flour and mix. Turn on a lightly floured board 
and knead into a soft elastic mass, using a half cupful of flour. 
Put it back into the large basin. Cover tightly and raise all 
night in a warm place, temperature 70°. By half-past six in 
the morning it should quite fill the basin. Turn out and knead 
long enough to form into loaves. Use one teaspoonful flour 
and no more for the last kneading; the dough must be soft 



BREAD, BISCUIT, ETC 8i 

and elastic. Put into pans, cover and raise an hour and a half 
in a temperature of 90°. The dough should more than double 
in size. The first ten minutes the oven should be hot enough 
to lightly brown the top ; then moderate a little) and bake for 
twenty-five minutes, not more than thirty minutes. This 
makes two loaves. Bread should be entirely cold before be- 
ing put away in the bread box. 

BREAD.

cool, add two tablespoonfuls of yeast and a half teaspoonful 
of salt. Let it rise over night. In the morning, take the 
bread bowl filled with flour, pour half a pint of boiling water 
in the center, and mix. Add enough cold water to make luke- 
warm ; then pour in the sponge made the night before, mix 
the dough soft and knead one-half hour. Put back into bread- 
bowl and set to rise. When light, knead down and set to rise 
again. Then knead into loaves, put into bread pans and when

USES FOR STALE BREAD 89 



USES FOR STALE BREAD 



Crusts and small pieces of bread should be dried in a cool 
oven until a light brown. Roll them on a pastry board, or put 
through a meat grinder. Crumbs must be sifted. Use them 
only to cover articles of food cooked in deep fat. Crumbs 
should be kept in jars with a piece of muslin tied over them. 

CROUTONS. 
Cut pieces of stale bread into cubes, and brown in the oven. 

SIPPETS. 

Cut bread into pieces two inches thick, cut either round 
or four and a half inches long by three inches wide. Remove 
part of the bread from the center, butter, and brown in oven. 

BREAD PUDDING. 

Butter the sides and bottom of a deep pudding dish, then 
place a layer of stale bread, rolled fine, in the bottom of the 
dish, then a layer of any kind of fruit ; sprinkle on a little 
sugar, then another layer of bread crumbs and of fruit, and 
so on until the dish is full, the top layer being crumbs. Make 
a custard as for pies, add a pint of milk and mix. Pour it over 



90 USES FOR STALE BREAD 

the top of the pudding and bake until the fruit is cooked. 
Stale cake crumbs fine, in place of bread, is an improvement. 



PLAIN BREAD PUDDING. 

Break up a pint of stale bread after cutting away the crust. 
Pour over it a quart of boiling milk ; add to this a piece of 
butter the size of an egg. Cover the dish tightly and let stand 
until cool, then with a spoon mash it until fine, add a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, one nutmeg grated, half a cupful of 
sugar, and one-quarter teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a little 
hot water. Beat up four eggs very light and add last. Turn 
all into a well-buttered pudding dish and bake three-quarters 
of an hour. Serve it warm with hard sauce. This recipe may 
be steamed or boiled. Very nice either way. 

SOUP STICKS. 

Cut stale bread into one to three inch slices, remove crusts, 
butter and brown in the oven. 



TOAST. 

Cut stale bread into slices one-fourth inch thick. Put it 
on a toaster, move it gently over the heat until dry, then allow 
it to become a little brown by placing it nearer the heat and 
turning constantly. It may be first dried in the oven. Hot 
milk may be poured over dry toast. 

ZWIEBACK. 

Cut baker's or other light bread into one-inch slices and 
brown in a moderate oven. 



USES FOR STALE BREAD 91 

CREAM TOAST. 

One tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, one and one-half cupfuls of milk or

quantity syrup and lemon jelly and pour into glasses ; this 
can also be moulded. 

APPLE SALAD. 

Line a salad bowl with watercress ; cut into neat dice half to 
three-quarters of a pound of cold veal or lean fresh pork, add to 
the cress; also add two raw tart apples cut small, season with 
salt and pepper, a teaspoonful of chopped pickle and a table- 
spoonful each of oil and vinegar. Mix and cover with a mask 
of salad dressing. 

BEAN SALAD. 

Put into a salad bowl half a dozen leaves of crisp lettuce, add 
a cupful each of baked beans and tongue, or ox palate, cut into 



SALADS 115 

dice, and two hard-boiled eggs cut not too fine; season with a 
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, salt, white pepper and two table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar ; mix together, arrange neatly and mask with 
a top layer of salad dressing. 

BEET SALAD. 

If the beets are to be cooked for salad making they are better 
baked than boiled, as they lose none of their rich color. Put 
into a salad bowl a layer of chickory leaves, slice in over this a 
baked beet; next add two or three roots of boiled oyster plant, 
kohl-rabi, or root celery, a button onion and a cucumber pickle; 
mask over all salad dressing. If pickled beets are used omit 
the pickle. The chickory may be omitted, and veal or fresh 
pork added. 

BEET AND SPANISH ONION SALAD. 

Cut into slices, then into strips, two baked beets, slice a 
medium-sized Spanish onion, and quarter and separate the sec- 
tions. If convenient add as much table celery as you have onion, 
half a teaspoonful of capers or chopped pickles, salt and white 
pepper; mix, then over all add salad dressing. 

CHICKEN SALAD. 

There is only one secret about this salad. Do not use tough, 
old fowl, nor use the meat too dry. When possible let the fowl 
stand in the water in which it was cooked until cold; this will 
make it sufficiently moist. When cold roast poultry is used, cut 
it up and moisten slightly with chicken broth, or water containing 
a little vinegar, pepper and salt. 

Mix equal quantities of cut-up chicken and celery with a few 
spoonfuls of salad dressing, arrange neatly in a bowl, and 



ii6 SALADS 

mask with more of the dressing. Decorate with eggs, olives 
and cucumber pickle. Use lettuce, watercress, chickory, wild 
chickweed, dandelion, or any other tender salad green when 
celery is scarce. 

CLAM SALAD. 

Boil two dozen medium clams in a pint of water ten minutes 
only; use the broth for a soup by whisking into it a half pint 
of warm milk containing a whisked egg; heat, but do not boil, 
and serve. 

Chop the clams, not too fine, put them into a salad bowl with 
one-third each of potato and cold fish ; lettuce or watercress may 
or may not be used. Cover with salad dressing. Hard-boiled 
eggs may be used if desired. 

CUCUMBER SALAD. 

The fresher the cucumbers are and the quicker they are served 
after being cut, the better ; always have them as cold as possible. 
They need a good deal of seasoning, therefore add a little salt, 
pepper and salad dressing, slightly thinned out with vinegar. 
Mix, set in the ice-box ten minutes and serve. 

For breakfast the cucumbers may be placed on a leaf bed of 
cress and garnished with a circle of crisp radishes. 

CUCUMBER SALAD TO SERVE WITH FISH. 

Peel the cucumbers, and place them in cold water to become 
crisp. Do not use salt in the water, as is sometimes recom- 
mended, as it wilts and makes them indigestible. Cut the cucum- 
bers in two lengthwise, and lay them, with the flat side down, 
on the dish on which they are to be served. Slice them without 
destroying their shape, and pour on them salad dressing. 



SALADS 117 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Cut the boiled lobster into one-inch pieces or larger. Marinate 
it, and keep in a cool place until ready to serve ; then mix with it 
lightly a little mayonnaise salad dressing. Place it in the salad 
bowl, smooth the top, leaving it high in the center. Mask it 
with a thick covering of salad dressing. Sprinkle over it the 
powdered coral of the lobster. Place on top the heart of a 
head of lettuce, and around the salad a thick border of crisp 
lettuce leaves, carefully selected. 

Shad roe, canned salmon, or any firm, white fish, mixed with 
mayonnaise salad dressing, and garnished with lettuce, may be 
served as a salad. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Use for this salad sour oranges ; if these cannot be obtained, 
strain over sweet oranges after they are sliced a little lemon- 
juice. Cut the oranges in thick slices, remove the seeds carefully, 
arrange them in rows, and turn over them salad dressing. 
Serve with game. 

Grape fruit may be used the same way, and walnut meats 
used with either. 

SHRIMP SALAD. 

When canned shrimps are used, they should be removed from 
the tin and thoroughly washed in cold water. Shrimps, tomatoes, 
hard-boiled eggs and watercress, with salad dressing, form a 
surprisingly good salad in warm weather. 

WATERCRESS AND APPLES. 

Prepare the watercress the same as lettuce, letting it become 
crisp in cold water, then drying it thoroughly. Mix it with 



ii8 SALADS 

mayonnaise salad dressing. A few thin slices of sour apple with 
watercress make a good salad to serve with ducks. 

A chopped hard-boiled €:gg sprinkled over the top of water- 
cress is a good garnish, and improves the salad. 



WALDORF. (APPLE AND CELERY SALAD.) 

Use bright red or green apples. Jonathans or Northern Spies 
are best. Cut the stem end off, saving it. Scoop out the apple 
pulp. Mix with one-third its bulk in chopped celery, and salad 
dressing number one, which has had cream added to it. Return 
this apple pulp and celery and dressing to the shell of apple. 
Replace the stem top. Serve the apple, very cold, on a lettuce 
leaf. 



SALAD DRESSING NO. i. 

One level teaspoonful flour, one level tablespoonful sugar, 
one level teaspoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful white pepper, 
one speck red pepper, yolks of two eggs. Mix these together 
and pour over it seven tablespoonfuls of hot vinegar. Stir well 
until thick. Add one large tablespoonful of butter and when it 
is well mixed in, take the mixture from the fire. Cool quickly. 
This may be kept a week or two. When ready to use, mix it 
with one-third its bulk in rich cream, sweet or sour. Whip the 
cream. 



CREAM DRESSING NO. 2. 

Two tablespoonfuls of whipped sweet cream, two of sugar 
and four of vinegar ; beat well and pour over the cabbage, previ- 
ously cut very fine and seasoned with salt. 



SALADS 119 

POTATO SALAD, HOT. 

Pare six or eight large potatoes, and boil till done, and slice 
thin while hot ; peel and cut up three large onions into small bits 
and mix with the potatoes. Cut up some breakfast bacon into 
small bits, sufficient to fill a teacup and fry it a light brown ; re- 
move the meat, and into the grease stir three tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, making a sour gravy, which with the bacon pour over 
the potato and onion ; mix lightly. To be eaten when hot. 

POTATO SALAD, COLD. 

Chop cold boiled potatoes fine, with enough raw onions to 
season nicely ; make a dressing as for lettuce salad, and pour 
over it. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Yolks of four eggs, one-half cupful sugar, one-fourth cup- 
ful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one small pinch 
of mustard, one very small pinch of cayenne pepper. Cream 
these ingredients together and add the hot vinegar. When 
cold, and you wish to use it, thin with one-third its bulk of 
very thick cream. Cut up oranges into small pieces and put 
a spoonful of the dressing over the orange. Serve cold. 

FRENCH SALAD DRESSING. 

Mix one saltspoonful of pepper with one of salt ; add three 
tablespoonfuls of olive oil and one even tablespoonful of onion 
scraped fine; then one tablespoonful of vinegar; when well 
mixed, pour the mixture over your salad and stir all till well 
mingled. 

The merit of a salad is that it should be cool, fresh and 
crisp. For vegetables use only the delicate white stalks of 



I20 SALADS 

celery, the small heart-leaves of lettuce, or tenderest stalks 
and leaves of the white cabbage. Keep the vegetable portions 
crisp and fresh until the time for serving, when add the meat. 
For chicken and fish salads use the mayonnaise dressing. For 
simple vegetable salads the French dressing is most appro- 
priate, using onion rather than garlic. 




SANDWICHES I2i 



SANDWICHES 



Bread for sandwiches should not be more than twenty-four 
hours old, and cut thin, the crust should all be neatly cut away 
and the butter creamed and evenly spread. If nuts are used 
they should be chopped fine, salted and mixed with butter, or 
with enough cream salad dressing to moisten. 

When preparing sandwiches for a large company it is 
sometimes necessary to make them several hours in advance 
of the serving. If a napkin is wrung out of hot water and 
wrapped around the sandwiches, which should then be placed 
in a cool room, they will keep as fresh and moist as though 
just spread. 

GRAHAM BREAD STRIPS. 

Take thin slices of graham bread and spread lightly with 
butter and then with prepared mustard, then grated cheese; 
press slices of bread firmly together, cut in inch wide strips, 
brown in the oven. To be eaten with salads. 

WATER CRESS SANDWICHES. 

Wash well some water cress and dry theni in a clean white 
cloth, pressing out every bit of the moisture. Then mix with 
the cress hard boiled eggs chopped fine, season with salt and 



122 SANDWICHES 

pepper to taste. Cut thin slices of bread and cut away the 
crust. Cut the cress into small pieces, removing the stems.

like paste. Then spread it on a plate to cool. Spread it be- 
tween slices of buttered bread and crisp lettuce leaves. Press 
both sides together. 

RUSSIAN SANDWICHES. 

Cut bread into very thin slices, then into squares. After

cupful of thick cream into which has been beaten the yolk of 
an egg. Stir until the mixture thickens. Remove from the 
fire and add five drops of lemon juice. When cold, spread 
between buttered sandwich bread. 



SANDWICHES 123 

HAM SANDWICHES. 

Mince fine three or four small slices of boiled ham, mix

odd shapes, spread them lightly with cream or Neufchatel 
cheese, take a corresponding number of slices and spread with 
olives and pimentos chopped and mixed with salad dressing; 
press the slices together with a leaf of crisp white lettuce be- 
tween each sandwich. 

TO MAKE BUTTERS FOR SANDWICHES. 

Rub the butter to a cream, blending any flavor desired, 
such as anchovy, caviare, sardine, lobster, cheese, parsley, 
cress, chives, horseradish, any of which may be used. 



124 SANDWICHES 

OLIVE SANDWICHES.

other slice of bread, and butter, press together; good for 
picnics and outings. 

CUCUMBER SANDWICHES. 

These are quite new. Slice medium sized cucumbers very 
thin, and let them stand in cold salt and water one-half hour, 
then drain off and pour over white wine, or tarragon vinegar, 
with a few drops of lemon juice, let stand one hour, lay the 
cucumber slices upon small rounds of brown bread, and spread 
with butter.

half teaspoonful of lemon juice. Cut bread and butter it; 
toast each slice a delicate brown ; spread with the above mix- 
ture while hot and put together. To be eaten cold. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES. 

Cut white bread in thin slices, cutting away all crusts. 
Place on a slice a fine tender lettuce leaf and spread with 
salad dressing; cover over with another slice and press gently 
together. Nasturtium leaves or flowers and a bit of mustard

or small, according to number of eggs used, pepper and salt and 
a little made mustard. Rub very smooth with a silver spoon ; 
spread between thin slices of buttered bread, from which the 
crust has been removed. Pile on a plate on a folded napkin. 



126 SANDWICHES 

NUT SANDWICHES. 

Mix half a cupful of chopped nuts with one tablespoonful 
of mayonnaise and spread on thin slices of entire wheat bread 
trimmed and cut into fancy shapes. Almonds, English wal- 
nuts, or peanuts may be used separately or in combination, 
and chopped dates may be added to the nuts. 

BANANA SANDWICHES. 

Select one large very ripe banana, peel and slice very thin 
and evenly. Sprinkle with one tablespoonful of lemon juice. 
Add a little honey to white cream cheese and spread on dainty 
rounds of bread instead of butter. Place a layer of the sliced 
bananas between the two slices. Preserved ginger and or- 
ange peel minced fine and mixed with a little sweet cream 
may be used for filling. 

LOBSTER SANDWICHES. 

Mix the coral of the lobster with a little butter and spread 
on thin slices of wheat bread. Dust with a little paprika. 
Have half a cup of the lobster meat chopped rather fine and 
mix with one tablespoonful of mayonnaise. Put this between 
the buttered slices with a lettuce leaf on each slice. Press 
the slices together. Serve on a small meat platter, garnished 
with lettuce and olives. 

OYSTER SANDWICHES. 
Half a dozen large oysters fried and perfectly cold, lay a 
crisp lettuce leaf dipped in French dressing on the buttered 
slices of white bread or spread a little dressing on each leaf. 
Cut the oysters into nice little slices crosswise, rejecting the 
hard part, and lay the slices, overlapping one another, be- 
tween the lettuce leaves. 



SANDWICHES 127 

WATERCRESS SANDWICHES. 

Select a five-cent bunch of fresh watercress ; remove the 
stems and chop the leaves fine ; add four to six tablespoonfuls 
of salad dressing to the chopped leaves ; mix, and spread over 
thin slices of bread. These sandwiches are appetizing. 

CELERY SANDWICHES. 
Chop fine three full-size stalks of celery ; add to this enough 
salad dressing to make a thick paste ; spread evenly over thin 
slices of white, graham, rye, or Boston brown bread; form 
sandwiches and cut these into squares or fingers. 

CAVIAR SANDWICHES. 

This form of sturgeon roe is becoming more and more 
popular with Americans, but one is rarely offered a perfectly 
made caviar sandwich. This is the way they should be made : 
Put into a soup-plate two tablespoonfuls of caviar, one table- 
spoonful of salad dressing and a scant half teaspoonful of 
chopped onion ; mix together, and while mixing, squeeze in the 
juice of half a juicy lemon, using care to remove the seeds. 
Spread the paste over dry thin slices of bread; form sand- 
wiches and cut these into fingers. The onion may be omitted 
if objected to. 

OLIVE SANDWICHES. 

This is a unique way of serving olives at teas and recep- 
tions. Cut the flesh from the stones of half a dozen queen 
olives, chop it fine, add to it a scant tablespoonful of salad 
dressing. Mix and spread on thin slices of buttered bread; 
form sandwiches and cut these into squares or fingers. Stuffed 
olives are very appetizing served this way. 



128 SANDWICHES 

A sandwich which enjoys great vogxie at New York teas 
is easily made. Butter three slices of white bread and two of 
graham. Lay light then dark on top of one another alternately 
and press carefully together, then cut like layer cake in pieces 
half an inch wide. 



GARNISHES 



For oysters, sardines, fish, roast veal or salads, lemon 
slices make a desirable garnish. For cold meats, chops and 
cutlets, parsley or celery tops. 

For decorating fowl nothing better than watercress can 
be used. Balls made of boiled rice with jelly on each are at- 
tractive on a plate of cold meat. 

In garnishing cold corned beef sliced gherkins and large 
pickles sliced make an attractive garnish. For game, cold 
tongue, fried oysters or roast veal, currant jelly is used as 
garnish. 

Never under any circumstances serve a heavy soup at a 
luncheon. 



BEVERAGES 129 



BEVERAGES 



Boiling water is a very important desideratum in the mak- 
ing of a cup of good coffee or tea. Do not boil the water 
more than three or four minutes ; longer boiling ruins the 
water for coffee or tea making, as most of its natural prop- 
erties escape by evaporation, leaving a very insipid liquid, 
composed mostly of lime and iron, that would ruin the best 
cofifee, and give the tea a dark, dead look. Water left in the 
tea-kettle over night should never be used ; no matter how ex- 
cellent your cofifee or tea may be, it will be ruined by the addi- 
tion of water that has been boiled more than once. 

FILTERED OR DRIP COFFEE. 

For each person allow a large tablespoonful of finely 
ground coffee, and to every tablespoonful allow a cupful of 
boiling water; the coffee to be one part Mocha to two of 
Java. 

Have a small iron ring made to fit the top of the coffee- 
pot inside, and to this ring sew a small muslin bag (the muslin 
for the purpose must not be too thin). Fit the bag into the 
pot, pour some boiling water in it, and, when the pot is well 
warmed, put the ground coffee into the bag; pour over as 
much boiling water as is required, close the lid, and, when all 



130 BEVERAGES 

the water has filtered through, remove the bag, and send the 
coffee to table. Making it in this manner prevents the ne- 
cessity of pouring the coffee from one vessel to another, which 
cools and spoils it. The water should be poured on the coffee 
gradually so that the infusion may be stronger; and the bag 
must be well made that none of the grounds may escape 
through the seams and so make the coffee thick and muddy. 
Patented coffee-pots on this principle can be purchased at 
most house-furnishing stores. 



TO MAKE TEA. 

Allow two teaspoonfuls of tea to one large cupful of boil- 
ing water. Scald the teapot, put in the tea, pour on about 
a cupful of boiling water, set it on the fire in a warm place 
where it will not boil, but keep very hot, to almost boiling; 
let it steep or "draw" ten or twelve minutes. Now fill up 
with as much boiling water as is required. Send hot to the 
table. It is better to use a china or porcelain teapot, but if you 
do use metal let it be tin, new, bright and clean ; never use it 
when the tin is worn off and the iron exposed. If you do you 
are drinking tea-ate of iron. 

To make tea to perfection, boiling water must be poured 
on the leaves directly it boils. Water which has been boiling 
more than five minutes, or which has previously boiled, should 
on no account be used. If the water does not boil, or if it be 
allowed to overboil, the leaves of the tea will be only half- 
opened and the tea itself will be quite spoiled. The water 
should be allowed to remain on the leaves from ten to fifteen 
minutes. 



BEVERAGES 131 

COLD TEA. 

Three tablespoonfuls of tea, six tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
one pint of water, juice of one lemon and a half. Let the tea 
stand in water over night. In the morning strain and add 
the lemon juice and sugar. After it has again stood an hour, 
strain again and the tea is ready for the cracked ice. Serve 
in small soda glasses. 

COFFEE. 

Be careful in buying coffee not to get too much at a time, 
as it loses its flavor, no matter how well sealed. For the 
small family the pulverized is best. Get a half pound of coffee 
and keep in an air tight glass jar. 

Never put dry coffee into the coffee pot, it makes it very 
hard to keep clean inside. A little cold water should be poured 
in first, then the egg, and last the coffee, then mix all together 
thoroughly. 

COFFEE. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of ground coffee with a teaspoon- 
ful of raw egg and two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Pour on 
this two cupfuls of boiling water, cover closely, and let it boil 
up; then remove from the fire. Let it stand a few minutes 
to settle, then strain into a hot coffee pot through a damp 
cheese cloth laid on a wire strainer. 

COCOA. 

Three tablespoonfuls of cocoa to a half pint of water, as 
much milk as water, sugar to taste. Rub the cocoa smooth in 
a little cold water ; have ready on the fire half a pint of boiling 



132 BEVERAGES

the milk and boil five minutes more, stirring often. Sweeten 
in cups so as to suit different tastes. 

LEMON SYRUP. 

Take the juice of six lemons; grate the rind of three in it, 
let it stand over night. Then take three pounds of white su- 
gar and make a thick syrup. When it is quite cool strain the 
juice into it, and squeeze as much oil from the grated rind as 
will suit the taste. Put into bottles, tightly corked, for future 
use. A tablespoonful in a goblet of ice water will make a 
delicious drink. 

MILK PUNCH FOR INVALIDS. 

One-half pint of milk made very sweet, half a wine glas^ 
of rum, stir well together. Grate a little nutmeg over the 
top of the glasses. Serve with straws in each glass. 

WINE WHEY FOR INVALIDS. 

Sweeten to taste half a pint of milk, put in a double boiler 
and let come to a boil, throw in one glass of cherry wine. 
When the curd forms, strain the whey through a clean muslin 
bag into small soda glasses. 

ORANGEADE. 

Juice of two oranges, two tablespoonfuls of powdered su- 
gar, four teaspoonfuls of lemon juice, one glass of finely 
chipped ice. Two glasses of water, shake well in a large shak- 
er. Serve in soda glasses, and dress with fruit.

LEMON EGGNOGG. 

Two tablespoonfuls of lemon syrup, two eggs, four dashes 
of Angastura bitters, one teaspoonful of rum, three table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, one glass of milk, and a cup of 
chipped ice. Shake well in shaker, strain, and serve in soda 
glasses with straws. 

DELMONICO'S EGG-LEMONADE. 

Two fresh eggs, two tablespoonfuls lemon juice, one and a 
half tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, one glass of finely 
chipped ice. Shake well in shaker, strain, and serve. 

EGG-PINEAPPLE. 

Half a cup of pineapple syrup, one cup of sweet cream, 
two eggs, one glass of chipped ice, three tablespoonfuls and 
a half of powdered sugar. Shake and serve in soda glasses 
with straws. 

MINT JULEP. 

Dampen a small bunch of mint, dust with powdered sugar, 
bruise slightly and pour over it a little boiling water; allow 



134 BEVERAGES 

this to draw, then strain into a tall, thin glass quite filled with 
finely cracked ice; dress the glass with sprigs of mint, and 
pour in enough brandy to fill. Do not stir, but stand it away 
till thoroughly cool. Serve with straws. 

HOT CLAM SODA. 

One teaspoonful of clam juice and a little cream; fill cup

one egg, one ounce grape juice, one-fourth ounce port wine, 
small quantity shaved ice ; fill glass with plain water ; shake, 
put in lemonade glass, finish with a slice of pineapple and a 
cherry. 

HOT EGG MILK. 

Two teaspoonfuls of sugar, one ounce cream, one egg, hot 
milk to fill an eight-ounce mug. Top with whipped cream and 
sprinkle with nutmeg. If there is no facility for keeping hot 
milk, use about two ounces of cream, and fill the mug with 
hot water. 

TOAST. 
Here's to the Lady we love and the friend we trust. 
And to the one who thinks the most good and speaks the 
least ill of his neighbor.

BREAKFAST FOODS 



VITOS BREAKFAST FOOD. 

To four and one-half cupfuls of boiling water, add one tea- 
spoonful salt and stir in gradually one cupful Pillsbury's 
Vitos. Let boil two minutes while stirring, then cook in a 
double boiler thirty minutes. If time allows, the flavor is 
much improved by longer cooking. With a single boiler the 
cooking of Vitos may be accomplished in fifteen minutes, but 
this needs careful watching, as the cereal is likely to become 
scorched, and this manner of cooking is wasteful. Serve 
Vitos with rich cream and sugar. 

CREAMED VITOS. 

To two and one-half cupfuls boiling water add one tea- 
spoonful of salt and stir in slowly one cupful of Pillsbury's 
Vitos. Let this boil five minutes, stirring all the time, then 
put it in a double boiler, add two cupfuls milk and let it cook 
for thirty minutes. Serve hot with cream. 

VITOS WHEAT FOOD WITH APPLES. 

Core apples, leaving large cavities ; pare and cook until 
soft in syrup made by boiling sugar and water together. Fill 
cavities with Pillsbury's Vitos mush and serve with sugar and 
cream. The syrup should be saved and re-used.

ENGLISH RAREBIT. 

Cut finely a cup of cheese and crumb a cup of bread 
crumbs, put in your chafing dish or frying pan a piece of but- 
ter the size of a walnut, add the cheese and stir it to a cream. 
Moisten the bread crumbs with a cup of milk, thicken with 
three eggs well beaten. This will serve six or eight persons. 



CHEESE DREAMS. 

Cut thin slices of bread and spread with butter; between 
two slices of the bread sandwich a thin slice of cream cheese. 
Fry quickly in butter in a chafing dish or frying pan. 



142 FOR THE CHAFING DISH 

SHRIMP WIGGLE. 

Make a white sauce of one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of flour, one-half pint milk. When thick add 
one-half can shrimps and one-half can green peas. Serve when 
the shrimps and peas are hot. 

NEW YORK CHAFED OYSTERS. 

Put one pint of oysters in a chafing dish, add butter size 
of an egg, salt, pepper and Worcestershire sauce to taste. 
When the oysters begin to heat, add flour a little at a time, 
to prevent lumps, stirring well, until the gravy is slightly 
thickened. Serve on hot plates. 

PIGS IN BLANKETS. 

Drain and wipe large oysters. Pin around each a thin 
slice of bacon. Fasten it with a wooden toothpick. Cook 
them in the hot blazer until the bacon is brown and crisp. 

STEWED KIDNEYS. 

Split the kidneys and cut each in three pieces. Brown them 
in butter. Stir flour and water in the pan to make a brown 
sauce, and cook the kidneys in this for ten minutes. 

BROILED LAMB CHOPS. 

Have rib chops, with the bones removed, rolled into ros- 
ettes. Broil in the hot blazer from eight to ten minutes, turn- 
ing them several times. Season with salt, pepper and but- 
ter. Broiled tomatoes should accompany this dish. 



FOR THE CHAFING DISH 143 

BROILED TOMATOES. 

Cut large tomatoes in thick slices, without peeling. 
Sprinkle them with a little salt, pepper and sugar and roll 
them in cracker dust. Put a tablespoonful of butter in the 
blazer, and put in the slices of tomato. Turn frequently until 
done. 



WELSH RAREBIT. 

Three cups of cheese, ale, red pepper, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one saltspoonful of mustard, one saltspoonful of salt, 
one saltspoonful of soda or bicarbonate of potash. Put the 
butter in the blazer over boiling water. Break the cheese 
in small pieces and stir it in the melted butter. Season it with 
salt, pepper, and dry mustard, and stir in the soda or potash. 
As the cheese begins to soften, slowly add the ale, two or 
three tablespoonfuls, stirring constantly. In a few moments 
it will be a smooth, thick cream. Stop cooking at once, be- 
fore it has time to curdle. If the cooking stops too soon it 
will be stringy. Serve on toast or crackers. A soft, rich 
cheese should be used. The American cream cheese is very 
good. The Welsh rarebit calls for ale. Cream may be sub- 
stituted for the ale, to make a temperance rarebit. 



BROWN SAUCE. 

One tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, one 
tablespoonful of onion juice, two cups of beef stock. Cook 
the onion, butter and flour until it is brown, add the stock,

before cooking in the chafing dish. Then prepare the white 
sauce and cook the chicken in it for about five minutes. 

DEVILED TONGUE. 

Sprinkle slices of tongue with mustard and red pepper,

butter. Season with salt and a dash of red pepper, and pour 
over the sherry. Cover the pan and cook five minutes. Mix 
the beaten eggs with the cream, and pour it on the lobster. 
Serve as soon as it boils. Shrimp and hard-shelled crab 
may be prepared the same. 

SPRING CHICKEN. 

Take one spring chicken and split open, lay in cold water 
for one hour; one-half Bermuda onion sliced and one-fourth 
pound best butter. Braise the onion to a delicate brown ; one- 
half teaspoonful of paprika, steam chicken thoroughly and 



146 FOR THE CHAFING DISH 

braise and cover until nearly done ; do not break the chicken ; 
put in one tablespoonful flour, shake well, add one pint of

light brown in butter, lay them in a hot chafing dish. To the 
butter in the spider add a little more butter, add as much 
flour as you did butter, stir well and add milk or cream, 
season to taste and pour over the tomatoes. It is best to serve 
either fried or broiled tomatoes in a chafing dish, as they cook 
very quickly.

All of the materials must be as cool as possible. 

Pastry flour should be used. 

The following fats may be used alone or in combinations 
of two ; butter, butterine, lard, cottolene, beef drippings. The 
fat should not be cut very fine, if a flaky crust is desired. Bak- 
ing powder is sometimes used. 

The dough should be mixed with a knife and not touched 
with the hands. It should be rolled in one direction only, 
and on one side, using but little flour. The dough is rolled 
thin and baked until brown. 

All pies made with fresh fruit should be made without an 
under crust, and cooked in a deep earthen-ware plate. Fill 
the plate very full. If sugar is used with fruit pies, it should 
be placed on the bottom of the pie plate. Meat and oyster- 
pies should also be made without an undercrust. The crust 
should be cut in several places to allow the steam to escape. 

If an under crust is used, this crust should be baked on the 
outside of a tin plate, then filled. In this case, the crust must 
be pricked all over with a fork so that it may keep its shape. 

If two crusts are used, the lower one should be moistened 
around the edge with cold water, then a half-inch strip of 
paste should be placed around the edge of the under-crust. 



PIES 149 

This strip should also be moistened, and the upper crust placed 
over the pie and pressed slightly around the edge. 

The paste may be made the day before using, then covered 
and placed on ice. It rolls more easily if placed on ice after 
mixing. 

PLAIN PASTRY. 

One and one-fourth cupfuls of pastry flour, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-third cupful of fat and butter, one-half of 
each, ice water. Mix in the order given. 

PIE CRUST FOR ONE PIE. 

One large cup flour, one-half cup shortening (lard and but- 
ter mixed) rubbed through the hands into the flour, a little salt, 
and wet with ice-cold water to make the dough just so it can 
be handled; flour the board, or, what is better, a marble slab. 
Divide the crust in two parts and cover the plate, reserving 
the rest for upper crust. This is a plain crust and just enough 
for one pie. Especially good for fruit pies. 

PIE CRUST. 

One even cupful of flour, and one teaspoonful of salt. Sift 
several times. Cut into the flour half a cup of ice cold lard, 
add four tablespoonfuls of ice cold water, stir with a spoon. 
Divide the paste in two equal parts, roll out one part for the 
under crust. The other half roll out an eighth, of an inch 
thick, dot it with a teaspoonful and a half of butter, dredge 
very lightly with flour, fold up to the smallest size possible, 
pat with the rolling pin, and roll out once, pressing the rolling 
pin this way and that. Slash with a knife any design you 
like, lay upon the fruit in the pan, pinch the edges together ; 
trim. Bake in hot oven. 



150 PIES 

GRANDMOTHER'S PUMPKIN PIE. 

Eight tablespoons pumpkin, one cup of sugar, one egg, 
one cup of milk, one teaspoonful molasses, pinch of salt; stir 
all together and set over a dish of hot water until it thickens; 
then fill the crusts and bake in a moderate oven. 

GRANDMOTHER'S APPLE PIE. 

One pint of flour and one teaspoonful salt, one tablespoon- 
ful of lard and two of butter, six tablespoonfuls of ice water, 
five good sized tart apples, one and one-half cups sugar, but- 
ter the size of walnut, one half fcupful water and either cin- 
namon, nutmeg or allspice to suit the taste; put flour, salt, 
lard and butter into a chopping bowl and chop until the lard 
and butter are like small sized peas; then add the water 
without mixing; turn out on the board and roll and fold over; 
continue to do so until the crust is smooth ; then line the pie- 
tin and fill with sliced apples and spice; do not put on a 
particle of sugar; then the upper crust with a slit cut in it; 
bake ; put on the fire the sugar, water and butter ; boil fifteen 
minutes or until it thickens; then pour through the slit you 
have made in the pie before it was baked; this sweetens the 
pie; the crust is not soggy, and the juice does not run out in 
the oven while baking as in the old way. 

RIPE CURRANT PIE. 

One cupful of mashed ripe currants, one of sugar, two ta- 
blespoonfuls of water, one of flour, beaten with the yolks of 
two eggs. Bake ; frost the top with the beaten whites of the 
eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and brown in 
the oven. 



PIES 151 

APPLE LEMON PIE. 

Two tart apples chopped fine, two eggs beaten, juice of 
two lemons, grated rind of one, a pinch of salt ; bake between 
two crusts. 

RASPBERRY PIE. 

Line a shallow pudding dish, or deep plate, with pie crust 
and fill with berries ; a cup of granulated sugar, mixed with 
one tablespoonful of flour; cover with a tolerably thick sheet 
of crust ; make several incisions for the escaping steam ; bake 
until crusts are a delicate brown; serve cool. 

CHERRY PIE. 

Line your pie tin with good crust, fill half full with ripe 
stoned cherries ; sprinkle over them one cupful of sugar, one 
teaspoonful of flour sifted, dots of butter here and there. Now 
fill the crust to the top with more cherries. Cover with the 
upper crust and bake. This is a most delicious pie. 

MINCE MEAT. 

One half a cupful of mixed candied citron, lemon and or- 
ange peels, half a cupful of suet, a cupful and a half of mixed 
raisins and currants, a cupful and a half of chopped apples, 
one cupful of cooked beef chopped fine, one heaping table- 
spoonful and a half of molasses, three tablespoonfuls of brown 
sugar, one teaspoonful and a half of mixed spices (nutmeg, 
allspice, cloves, cinnamon and black pepper), three pinches of 
salt, half a cup of brandy and half a cup of cider mixed. 
Cover the raisins with cold water and seed them. Wash and 
pick over the currants, cover both currants and raisins with 



152 PIES 

cold water and cook slowly until the water has boiled away. 
Add the candied fruit and suet chopped fine, sugar, molasses, 
spices and cider, boil slowly one hour and ten minutes, stirring 
quite often. Mix apples and meat together, add salt and other 
ingredients, cook thoroughly fifteen minutes. Put away in 
jar in a cool place until wanted. This makes one large pie. 
Before covering the pie, it is a good idea to lay on top a few 
nut meats, either hickory or English walnuts. 

Mince meat should stand at least three days before using. 

PIE PLANT PIE. 

Wash and skin the pie plant, and cut in inch length pieces, 
put in granite pan and cover with cold water and heat to 
boiling and drain off the water; to two cupfuls of pie plant 
add one cupful sugar, a tablespoonful of flour mixed. Line 
the plate with paste, put in the pie plant and cover with thin 
crust with slashes for steam to escape, and keep the juice from 
running out while cooking. Bake till the crust is a delicate 
brown. 



BAKERS' CUSTARD PIE. 

Beat up the yolks of three eggs to a cream. Stir thorough- 
ly a tablespoonful of sifted flour into three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar; this separates the particles of flour so that there will 
be no lumps ; then add to it the beaten yolks, put in a pinch of 
salt, a teaspoonful of vanilla and a little grated nutmeg; next 
the well-beaten whites of the eggs ; and, lastly, a pint of scald- 
ed milk (not boiled) which has been cooled; mix this in by 
degrees and turn all into a deep pie-pan lined with pufT paste, 
and bake from twenty-five to thirty minutes. 



PIES 153 

WHIPPED CREAM PIE. 

Line a pie plate with a rich crust and bake quickly in a 
hot oven. When done, spread with a thin layer of jelly or 
jam, then whip one cupful of thick sweet cream until it is as 
light as possible ; sweeten with powdered sugar and flavor with 
vanilla; spread over the jelly or jam; set the cream where 
it will get very cold before whipping. 

CRANBERRY PIE. 

Take fine, sound, ripe cranberries and with a sharp knife 
split each one until you have a heaping coffee cupful ; put 
them in a vegetable dish or basin ; put over them one cupful 
of white sugar, half a cup of water, a tablespoonful of 
sifted flour; stir it all together and put into your crust. Cover 
with an upper crust and bake slowly in a moderate oven. 
You will find this the true way of making a cranberry pie. 

APPLE PIE. 

Wipe and cut tart apples into eighths ; remove the cores 
and skins. Vary the amount of sugar according to the acidity 
of the apples, using two tablespoonfuls or more for an apple. 
If the apples are not juicy, add from one-half tablespoonful to 
one tablespoonful water, according to the size of the apple. 

The apples may be flavored with lemon juice, cinnamon or 
nutmeg, and should be covered with bits of butter. Bake until 
the apples are soft and the crust is brown. Apple sauce may 
be used on a baked crust.

One-fourth cupful flour, one cupful sugar, one cupful of 
boiling water, juice and rind of one lemon, four tablespoon-

utes, stirring frequently, add the mixture to the egg, add but- 
ter and lemon, and cook until the egg thickens. When the mix- 
ture is cool, place it in a baked crust. Cover with a meringue, 
and bake until a delicate brown.

tablespoonfuls flour dissolved in cold water; when it is thor- 
oughly cooked, place in crust and make a meringue of the 
whites ; put on top and set in oven to brown ; one pie. 



SQUASH PIE. 

Take one part of a Hubbard squash, cut in half, scrape out 
the seeds and peel ; put into a saucepan and cover with salt 
water. Mash fine ; one good cupful will make a pie. Use the 
other as a vegetable. Beat the yolk of one egg with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a half teaspoonful of ground ginger, 
three pinches of salt, and two-thirds of a cup of hot milk; 
pour on slowly, stirring all the time. Add a teaspoonful and 
a half of butter and a heaping cup of hot mashed squash, a 
scant teaspoonful of flour, three pinches of grated nutmeg. 
Beat all together, add the white of the egg beaten to a froth.

sugar over the top. Bake in a hot oven ten minutes. 



PIES 155

174 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 



Fruits, Jellies, Preserves, Etc. 



Fruit for preserving should be sound and free from all de- 
fects, using dry white sugar. If the sugar is the least bit 
moist, put in the oven and heat it, but do not let it get the least 
brown. There cannot be too much care taken in selecting 
fruit for jellies, for if the fruit is over ripe, any amount of 
time in boiling it will never make it jelly. In preserving be 
generous with the sugar. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Take large, ripe cherries, and to each pound of cherries 
allow a pound of loaf sugar. Stone the cherries and save the 
juice that comes from them in the process. As you stone 
them, throw them into a large pan or tureen and throw half 
the sugar over them and let them lie in it two hours after they 
are all stoned. Then put them in the kettle with the remain- 
der of the sugar. Boil and skim them till the fruit is clear and 
the syrup thick. Put away in tightly sealed jars. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Stem and pick over the berries carefully. Mash well, and 
pour all into a preserving kettle and cook slowly for ten min- 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 175 

utes to extract the juice. Strain through a colander, and then 
through a jelly-bag, keeping it as hot as possible as it jellies 
much quicker. A few quince seeds boiled with the berries 
the first time tend to stiffen it. Allow a pound of loaf sugar to 
every pint of juice, and boil fast for twenty-five minutes. Try 
a little on a cold dish and when it seems done, remove and put 
into jelly glasses. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Stem three quarts of currants and put into a small-mouthed 
stone jar, tie over it a thick brown paper, set it into a ket- 
tle of water and let them cook one hour after the water begins 
to boil. Then strain through a flannel bag. Pour the juice 
into a procelain kettle and let it just come to a boil. Take it 
from the stove and stir in equal amount of sugar slowly, that it 
may have time to dissolve. Pour into glasses and let it cool ; 
when cool, cover with white paper dipped in brandy and iaid 
on the top of the jelly. Tie or seal over a large piece of paper. 
Put away in cool dry place. A good thing to do is to heat 
the sugar in the oven, as it drives out the moisture and causes 
the fruit to jelly more readily. Try and make it a point to 
make jelly on a bright, sunny day. 

PLUM MARMALADE. 

After the juice is taken from the plums, rub the pulp 
through a colander. To this add an equal amount of sugar 
and boil twenty minutes. Put up like jelly. 

PLUM JELLY. 

To one peck of plums add three pints of water, boil until 
soft, pour into a jelly bag and let it drip, but do not squeeze. 



176 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 

Take equal weights of juice and sugair, and boil twenty min- 
utes or until it jellies. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

To one pound of currant juice take five pounds of rasp- 
berries and five pounds of sugar. Put the sugar and berries 
in layers, mash them and let them stand one hour, then add 
the currant juice and boil a half-hour. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Select sound, ripe peaches. Peel, halve, and stone them. 
For every quart of peaches an equal amount of sugar. To 
every three pounds of sugar, add one cupful of boiling water. 
Melt, and boil fifteen minutes. Then drop in the peaches and 
cook them until a straw will pierce them easily. Skim care- 
fully and put into heated jars. Boil and skim the syrup eight 
minutes longer, fill the jars with the syrup and seal. 

A good plan is to halve and stone them before peel- 
ing, or take a dozen or more peaches and scald them by pour- 
ing boiling water over them and let stand two minutes, no 
longer. In this way they will easily peel. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

Above all, peaches must be spotless and not too ripe. 
Peel carefully, but do not stone them, as it adds to the flavor. 
Allow one pint of water and one cupful of sugar to every quart 
of peaches. Boil sugar and water for fifteen minutes; then 
add the peaches a few at a time and boil gently, and when a 
broom straw will pierce them easily they have cooked enough. 
Put the peaches in jars that have been well heated with boil- 
ing water, put the peaches in two thirds full. Boil and skim 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 177 

the syrup and pour over the peaches until the jars are full. 
Seal at once. Keep canned goods in a cool, dark place, the 
darker the better. 



SPICED PEACHES. 

Five pounds of peaches, two and a half pounds of sugar, 
one-quarter of a pint of cider vinegar, a quarter of an ounce 
of stick cinnamon, a quarter of an ounce of whole cloves, a 
quarter of a teaspoonful of whole allspice, and an eighth of a 
nutmeg broken into bits. Boil the sugar and vinegar together 
fifteen minutes. Put in enough peeled peaches to cover the 
bottom of the kettle and cook gently until a straw will pierce 
them easily. Skim the peaches out very carefully. Put them 
on a hot platter and cook the remainder of the peaches in the 
same way. When done, drain off the juice, put it in the kettle, 
boil up, and skim. Put the peaches in a stone jar, pour the hot 
syrup over them, tie the spices in a bag and lay on top. Cover 
closely, and in five days pour off the juice, boil up, and pour 
hot over the peaches. Cover tightly, with heavy brown paper 
or a coarse cloth. Keep in a cold, dry, dark place. 

PRESERVED WATERMELON. 

Take the thick rind of a ripe watermelon, cut it into small 
strips, cut off all the red part and scrape the outside. Boil the 
rind with peach leaves and saleratus — twelve leaves and one 
teaspoonful of saleratus to two quarts of water. This will 
turn them green. Boil till tender, then take them out and put 
them into cold water with a half tablespoonful of alum dis- 
solved in it to make them brittle. Let them soak one hour. 
Then rinse them in clear water and boil fifteen or twenty min- 
utes in a syrup of equal parts of sugar and water adding lem- 



178 FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 

ons cut into small pieces, allowing one lemon to two pounds of 
rind. When cool, add a little extract of ginger. Let them 
stand three days. Then pour the syrup off, boil it till very 
rich, and just cover the rinds. Pour on boiling hot. 

CANNED PEACHES, OR OTHER FRUIT. 

Make a syrup of two pints of water and four pints of sugar. 
Let it boil, put in the peaches and cook till tender, then fill 
the cans. Add more sugar as the syrup thins by putting in 
fruit. 

While canning fruit, put a table knife all around inside of 
the jar, moving slowly, until the bubbles do not rise. Then 
fill again. 

AMBROSIA. 

Two sweet oranges peeled and sliced, four slices of pine- 
apple, and a half cupful of grated cocoanut. Place alternate 
layers of orange and pineapple with the grated cocoanut be- 
tween, and sprinkle pulverized sugar over each layer. This 
is delicious. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Pare, core and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and allow 
an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the parings and cores 
and put in a preserving kettle ; cover them with water and boil 
for half an hour; then strain through a hair sieve, and put 
the juice back into the kettle and boil the quinces in it a little 
at a time until they are tender, lift out as they are done 
with a drainer and lay on a dish ; if the liquid seems scarce 
add more water. When all are cooked, throw into this liquor 



FRUITS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC 179 

the sugar, and allow it to boil ten minutes before putting in 
the quinces; let them boil until they change color, say one 
hour and a quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are boiling oc- 
casionally slip a silver spoon under them to see that they, do 
not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh lem- 
ons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put in jars 
lay a slice or two in each. Quinces may be steamed until 
tender.

stand till the next day; drain off the juice and boil again, 
and pour boiling hot over the cherries, repeat this twice more 
and seal. These are delicious. 

RED CURRANTS WITH ORANGES AND RAISINS. 

Five pounds of currants, three and one-half pounds of su- 
gar, one pound of raisins, three pounds of oranges. Wash 
and stem currants, stone raisins, and cut oranges into small 
pieces. Boil the currants twenty minutes ; add the raisins and 
cook a little longer, then add the sugar and let it come to a 
boil, then put in the oranges. Remove from the fire and put 
in jelly glasses. This recipe fills fifteen glasses. 




CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 



HOLIDAY CANDY-MAKING AT HOME. 

The cream candies should be put into a closely covered 
dish as soon as cold, and they are much better after being kept 
this way for several days. Horehound, butter-scotch, tafify, 
etc., should also be kept covered, as this prevents them from 
becoming moist and sticky. 

Fondant is the foundation for innumerable kinds of cream 
candies and is made as follows : 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful of hot water, 
and one-third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. Place on 
the back of the stove and stir until thoroughly dissolved. If 
there are any grains around the sides of the pan, clean off 
with a damp cloth before letting it come to a boil. Boil over 
a quick fire until a little of it dropped into cold water will 
make a soft ball. Remove the mixture from the fire and put 
it aside to cool, leaving it in the dish in which it was cooked. 
Do not put it into cold water to cool. When cool (not cold) 
stir until it becomes a thick creamy mass. When it is too hard 
to stir any more, take it into the hands and knead. Kneading 
the fondant has somewhat the same effect on the candy as 
kneading dough has upon bread ; it makes it light and smooth. 
Then put it into an earthen dish, cover with a slightly damp- 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 185 

ened cloth and let stand until desired for use. It will be better 
after standing for two or three days, and it will keep for a 
week or more. If the fondant is grainy after being stirred, put 
more water with it, dissolve again and cook as before, taking 
care not to jar the pan either while it is cooking or cooling. 

For pink fondant use the same proportions as for the white, 
adding half a tablespoonful of pink sugar, which can be bought 
of a confectioner and is inexpensive, a small quantity lasting a 
long time. 

For maple fondant use : Two cupfuls of light-brown (cof- 
fee C) sugar, a cupful of maple syrup, a cupful of hot water 
and one-third of a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. This is 
more easily made than either of the other kinds, as the brown 
sugar is more moist than the white and is not as likely to 
grain. It is, therefore, a good one with which to begin. 

NUT WAFERS. 

Use white fondant for these. It is not well to melt too 
much at a time, because it will get hard before you can drop 
it all. Have ready over the fire a pan with about half an inch 
of water in it. Put the fondant into a small stew-pan and 
place the pan in the water for the fondant to melt. Flavor 
with vanilla, stir in broken walnut meats and drop from a 
spoon on parafine paper. Pecan nuts, black walnuts, hickory 
nuts, etc., may also be treated in this way. 

WALNUT CREAMS. 

These may be made with either the white or maple fondant. 
Roll a piece of the fondant into a ball and press well into each 
side half a walnut meat, then lay aside on parafine paper to 
harden. The white fondant should have a few drops of vanil- 
la worked into it before being made up into balls. 



i86 CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 

COCUANUT WAFERS. 

Use white fondant. Melt, flavor with vanilla and mix in 
shredded cocoanut until quite stiff; then drop on parafiine 
paper. 

PEPPERMINT AND WINTERGREEN WAFERS. 

Use white fondant, or pink for the wintergreen, if pre- 
ferred. Melt, flavor with two or three drops of peppermint or 
wintergreen oil and drop on the paper in small round wafers. 
These are very nice and are more quickly made than any of the 
others, as well as less expensive. Maple wafers may be made 
in the same way, but no flavoring is necessary for them. 

BUTTERSCOTCH. 

Two cupfuls of granulated sugar, one cupful of Golden 
Drip syrup, half a cupful of butter. Cook the ingredients un- 
til they make a hard ball when dropped into water. Pour 
into buttered pans, having the candy about half an inch 
thick. Cut into squares when cool and wrap in parafline 
paper. 

HOREHOUND. 

Packages of the horehound can be bought of a druggist 
at trifling expense. Two-thirds of a teaspoonful of this 
steeped for a few minutes makes a flavor strong enough for 
three cupfuls of sugar. Use the proportions of a cupful of 
water to two cupfuls of sugar and half a teaspoonful of cream 
of tartar. Strain the tea carefully and pour it over the sugar ; 
add water and cream of tartar and stir until thoroughly dis- 
solved. Boil until when dropped into water it is very brittle 
and does not seem at all chewy. Pour into pans and mark 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 187 

into squares when cool. If covered, this will keep for weeks 
without getting sticky. Half a cupful of Coffee C sugar add- 
ed to the granulated makes a better color for this candy. 



FUDGE. 

'ihree cupfuls granulated sugar, one cupful of milk. Boil, 
and when it hardens a little in cold water add one tablespoon- 
ful butter and two squares of chocolate. Take from the stove, 
beat well and put in buttered tin. Walnuts may be added. 

WALNUT PANOCHA. 

Four cups of light brown sugar, one-half cup cream or 
milk. Boil five minutes. Put in one cup chopped walnut 
meats, boil about three minutes, then take off and stir until 
cool and thick enough to put on buttered platter. 

MACAROONS. 

Oncrhalf pound almonds, blanched and dried and pounded 
in a mortar, with one teaspoonful rose water; beat the whites 
of three eggs with one gill of powdered sugar, adding one ta- 
blespoonful at a time, one-half teaspoonful almond extract, 
the powdered almonds, and, if the paste is too soft, add a tea- 
spoonful flour; wet the hands, shape the paste into balls; 
place on buttered paper and bake slowly. 

CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

One cup of grated chocolate, one cup of molasses, one 
cup brown sugar, butter size of a small egg; put all in sauce- 
pan, except chocolate; test by dropping in cold water; when 
done pour on buttered pans.

with essence of peppermint. 

CANDIED ORANGE PEEL. 

When oranges are used save the peels by putting in a jar 
of salt and water ; when there are what you wish to candy puf- 
them on the stove in cold water; boil up well and drain and 
put in clear water, changing till the bitter is out of the peel

solve the sugar; put in the peel and cook till clear; remove 
from the syrup and put on plates, with sugar, and set in warm- 
ing closet to dry. 



OPERA CREAMS. 

Two cups sugar, one cup cream and boil till it makes a 
soft ball when dropped in water. Flavor with vanilla, stir till 
cool, then work on the bread board. Spread on a plate and

FUDGE. 

Two cups sugar and one cup cream or milk, one-fourth 
pound chocolate unsweetened, small piece of butter; when it 
begins to boil stir constantly; when it hardens slightly in 
water take from range ; flavor with vanilla and stir till cool ; 
turn on a buttered tin ; when cold cut in squares. 

BRANDY TUTTI FRUTTI. 

Just before strawberry season put one quart of brandy and 
three pounds of sugar in a three gallon jar; stir this frequently 
and when strawberries are ripe hull three pounds and put them 
in the jar, with three pounds of sugar. Always add an equal 
weight of fruit and sugar. Add each fruit in season. Stone 
the cherries ; plums must be cut in pieces ; peaches and apri- 
cots pared and sliced; pineapples are a delicious addition. 
This mixture must be covered closely in a cool place and 
stirred every day until the jar is full. Serve with ice cream 
and blanc manges. 

CREAM TAFFY. 

Take two pounds of light brown sugar; pour over it 
enough cold water to cover it well before putting it over the 
fire; after it begins to boil add a tablespoonful of vinegar; 
just before the taffy is done put in a lump of butter the size of 
a small eigg: cook till it will be quite hard when dropped 
into cold water. Do not stir at all or the tafify will be sugar 
before pulled. Remove from the fire and put in flavoring; 
pour quickly into well buttered platters and set in cool place. 
Begin to pull as soon as it is possible to take it into the hands. 
The quicker it is pulled the better it will be. If a flavor is de- 
sired add one tablespoonful of grated chocolate to each platter 



CANDIES AND CONFECTIONS 191 

just after it is poured out. As the taffy is pulled the choco- 
late will mix with it. Pull as long as possible, till it is quite 
hard and very white, and cut in small pieces ; put aside for sev- 
eral hours. It will cream nicely. 

BUTTER SCOTCH. 

Two cups white sugar, four tablespoons molasses, four 
tablespoons water, small half cup vinegar. Cook until it hard- 
ens in cold water, then add one-half cup butter. Flavor with 
vanilla.

INVALID COOKING 



INDIAN MEAL GRUEL. 

One quart boiling water, one tablespoonful flour, two ta- 
blespoonfuls white corn meal, one-half cupful cold water, one- 
half teaspoonful salt; mix the flour, meal and salt in the cold 
water, add to the boiling water and cook ten or fifteen minutes, 
stirring all the time. Remove to the back of range and let 
cook half an hour longer, stirring it occasionally; strain 
through very fine sieve or cloth. To each cup of the gruel 
add one-half cup of milk, one-fourth teaspoonful of butter, 
more salt if needed, and a tiny bit of sugar if the gruel is 
liked better sweetened ; a teaspoonful of whipped cream added 
to a cupful of gruel makes it more tempting ; place the cream 
on top of the cup just as it is ready to serve. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One neck of mutton, one-fourth cupful pearl barley, one 
stalk celery, one onion, one sprig parsley, one teaspoonful of 
salt; cover the meat with cold water after it is washed and 
cut into rather small pieces, add the washed barley ; let it come 
to a boil slowly, add the vegetables cut small and one tea- 
spoonful salt. Simmer until the meat drops from the bones ; 



INVALID COOKING 193 

let the broth become cold. Remove every particle of fat, 
strain through cloth or fine wire sieve; boil, pour into cups 
and put a tablespoonful of whipped cream on each cup of the 
hot broth. 



OATMEAL GRUEL. 

One cupful oatmeal, three pints cold water; boil slowly 
three hours or more until the oatmeal is creamy. Strain 
through a fine sieve, rubbing part of the oatmeal through. 
Do not try to rub too much or the gruel will be too thick. 
This can be set in the ice box and re-heated as needed, but it 
should be strained from the dish in which it is prepared into 
cups, as the jelly is apt to remain in little particles in the 
milk. For each cup of the prepared gruel add one-half cupful 
milk, one-fourth teaspoonful butter, salt to taste. One tea- 
spoonful sugar is considered an addition by some. 



CLAM BROTH. 

This will be found specially acceptable before breakfast and 
it is so easily prepared that it can be made fresh daily. Pro- 
cure a dozen clams in the shell, scrub well in cold water to 
remove every particle of sand, place in a saucepan, cover with 
boiling water — about a pint — and boil about fifteen minutes, 
or until all the clams are open. Take out the shells, chop the 
clams fine, skim the broth, return the clams to it, season to 
taste, with a tiny bit of butter or cream, pepper and salt, if 
necessary, and serve piping hot in a cup with toast or crack- 
ers. It may be necessary to strain the clams out entirely for 
one very ill, but all the properties of the clam with the lime in 
the shells are preserved in the broth.

FRUIT SYRUP. 

A refreshing drink to use in fever cases may be made from 
dried peaches or apricots. Thoroughly wash one-half pound 
of the fruit, taking it piece by piece between the thumb and 
forefinger. Soak over night in one quart of water. In the 
morning simmer for half an hour, strain and chill. 

BARLEY GRUEL. 

Barley gruel is made the same as the oatmeal gruel, sub- 
stituting washed barley for the oatmeal. 

CRUST COFFEE. 

Dry stale slices of bread in the oven until it is as brown 
as the coffee berry, but do not scorch it; pour boiling water 
over the bread and set on the back of the stove for a few min- 
utes, where it will keep very hot but not boil. Pour off the 
liquid carefully and serve with cream and sugar. 

TOAST WATER. 

Toast brown bread without burning it and put into cold 
water; it will be ready for use in one hour; if preferred sweet 
add loaf sugar to taste. 

BEEF TEA. 

Two pounds lean beef, one and one-half quarts cold water; 
chop the beef fine, pour on the water, let stand one hour, then 
set back on the range and let come to a boil slowly. Simmer 
one hour, strain through cheese cloth, and season to taste. 
Serve very hot. 



INVALID COOKING 195 

TO CLARIFY BEEF TEA. 

Add one-half white of egg slightly beaten to one pint of 
cold beef tea; let it come to a boil and strain through cheese 
cloth. 

BEEF BROTH. 

A nutritious beef broth that can be kept a week in the 
winter is made in this way : Order three pounds of solid beef 
from the shoulder or shin and three pounds of bone from the 
shank. Have the butcher crack the latter. Trim off any 
dried pieces of skin or soft or bloody portions of meat, and 
put the bones and meat in a stone jar. Cover with four 
quarts of cold water, set in a slow oven and cook, covered, 
from eight to twelve hours. Strain and season with two tea- 
spoonfuls of salt. Set aside, uncovered, to cool. If you wish 
to keep it for several days do not remove the fat, which will 
rise to the top and harden. Take out a little as needed, heat 
and serve very hot. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

As the convalescent nears the pudding stage, an old-fash- 
ioned floating island is nourishing and digestible. Heat a pint 
and a half of milk in the double boiler until scalding, but do 
not allow it to boil. Beat the yolks of three eggs with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and pour over the egg and sugar very 
gradually a cupful of the hot milk. Return to the boiler with 
the rest of the milk and cook until it begins to thicken. When 
cooked flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla or orange and 
pour into a glass dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth, adding a half cup of currant jelly a teaspoonful at a 



196 INVALID COOKING 

time. Spread over the custard and place in a rather cool oven 
for a few moments to "set." 

FRIZZLED EGGS. 

Put a piece of butter the size of a small nut in a cup with 
a pinch of salt, a little white pepper. Break in two eggs with- 
out stirring. Cook in a pan of boiling water until the whites 
are set. Serve immediately. 

CHICKEN JELLY. 

Pound one-half raw chicken, bones and meat together, with 
a wooden potato masher or mallet. Heat slowly in three pints 
of cold water. Cover and cook until the meat is in shreds and 
the water reduced one-half. Strain through a hair sieve and 
season with pepper and salt, then let it simmer about five 
minuteSo When cold skim ; keep on ice, and serve with 
wafers. Very nourishing for the convalescent. 

APPLE DAINTY. 

Wipe, quarter, pare and core apples ; to each pint allow 
one-third of a cupful of sugar, one-third cupful of cold water, 
a speck of cloves. Put into an earthen dish, cover tightly 
and bake slowly eight hours. When candied and deep red in 
color pile lightly on a dish, and pour over a boiled custard, 
made with the yolks of three eggs, two tablespoonfuls of su- 
gar, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla and one pint of scalded 
milk. Pile lightly over this the three whites, beaten with one 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

A good sponge cake served with sweet cream or a glass of 
milk makes an excellent lunch for an invalid. To make the 



INVALID COOKING 197 

cake, beat six eggs and a cup of sugar together until perfectly 
creamy, light and white. Add a teaspoonful of flavoring, and 
two tablespoonfuls of cold water and beat again. Stir in 
lightly one cupful of sifted flour, with a scant teaspoonful of 
baking powder with it, but do not beat. Merely fold it in. 
Bake in a deep tin in a rather slow oven. 



BAKED CUSTARD. 

Many cooks believe that the baked custard must be served 
in the baking dish or cup, and they never attempt to unmould 
it ; this can be done easily if the mould is buttered before the 
custard is poured in. If the moulds are small the usual 
proportion of eggs is sufficient, but if large, it is well to add 
one more egg to a quart of milk. Scald one pint of milk and 
pour over three beaten eggs, beaten with one-quarter cupful 
of sugar, one-quarter level teaspoonful of salt, and one-half 
teaspoonful flavoring. Strain into buttered mould holding one 
and one-half pints. Set in a pan of hot water in a moderate 
oven and bake slowly until firm, then unmould onto a dish 
for serving. 



UNFERMENTED GRAPE JUICE. 

Cover Concord grapes with cold water (after removing 
from the stems and washing thoroughly in a colander), then 
boil until tender. Press the juice through a wire sieve and 
add to it one cupful of sugar to every three quarts of fruit 
juice. Place over the fire, let just come to a boil, and bottle 
hot. Do not let grapes boil too long the first time, nor any 
more than boil up the last time, or the flavor will be impaired. 
Serve with cracked ice. For invalids, dilute one-half. 



198 INVALID COOKING 

WINE JELLY. 

One ounce of gelatine, one and one-half quarts of water, 
one and one-half pounds of sugar, three lemons, two tumblers 
sherry wine, one wine glass brandy, one-fourth teaspoonful 
essence of cinnamon. Soak the gelatine in the water till 
thoroughly dissolved, add the sugar and the lemons cut in 
thin slices, the wine, brandy and cinnamon. Let it come just 
to a boil. Strain into moulds and set on ice to harden. 

EGG NOG. 

Beat three eggs, yolks and whites separately, mix the 
yolks with three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Beat well and then 
add one pint of rich milk and grated nutmeg, four teaspoon- 
fuls of the best whiskey. Lastly whip in the whites of the 
eggs. 

CHICKEN CUSTARD. 

To one-half pint of cream add one-half pint of strained 
chicken stock; heat in a double boiler. When hot add the 
well beaten yolks of two eggs. Cook to the consistency of 
soft custard. Season with salt and turn into cups, and serve 
cold. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

Heat one pint of chicken stock boiling hot. Beat two 
eggs and yolks well, add to boiling mixture and cook three 
minutes. Flavor with sherry and serve hot. 

LEMON JELLY. 

One teaspoonful of granulated gelatine. Soak in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water, add four tablespoonfuls of boil- 



INVALID COOKING 199 

ing water, two tablespoonfuls sugar and the juice of one-half 
lemon. Turn into a mould and set in ice water to harden. 



ROSE GELATINE. 

Use any brand of gelatine that has rose coloring, mould 
in long shallow granite pan, just thick enough to cut out 
heart shaped pieces with a cookie cutter. These come in heart 
shapes and can be used in cutting sandwiches too. Serve with 
whipped cream not sweetened. 

MUTTON BROTH. 

One-fourth of a pound of neck of mutton ; cut of? all fat 
and skin, cut the meat in small pieces, add to it two table- 
spoonfuls of barley and two cupfuls of cold water. Heat 
slowly to the boiling point and skim carefully and set back 
on the stove where it will just simmer (180 degrees Fall.). 
Cover the bones with one cupful of cold water and cook slowly 
forty minutes, strain the broth from the bones to the meat 
and barley and cook two hours more. Strain and season with 
salt. 

MUSHES. 

The following formula will apply to the cooking of all 
cereals. The importance of the long cooking of all starchy 
material cannot be too strongly emphasized. 

To one cupful of cereal, add one teaspoonful of salt. 
Have the water boiling rapidly, drop in the cereal slowly, 
that the water may not cease boiling, cook rapidly directly 
over the fire until the starch grains have swollen and burst 
open the cellulose pockets, and the mixture has thickened 
and settled. Now place the top of the double boiler over 



200 INVALID COOKING 

the lower part and steam from six to eight hours. The 
amount of water used should be one-fourth more than is given 
on the package. 

An attractive method of serving mush is to remove the 
core of an apple, making a large cavity, steam it and when 
done fill the cavity with the cooked cereal. If it is desired 
to serve more cereal, a wall of cereal may be formed around 
the apple. Serve with cream and sugar to taste. Dates, 
figs and raisins properly prepared may be served with the 
cereals. 

OYSTER TOAST. 

Serve broiled oysters on cream toast and sprinkle with 
minced celery. 

BROILED TENDERLOIN. 

Cut an inch slice of tenderloin, broil eight minutes over 
coals, turning every ten seconds. At the same time broil a 
small piece of round. Press the juice of the round over the 
tenderloin, season with butter, salt and lemon juice. A little 
minced parsley may be added. 

EGG TOAST. 

Brown a slice of bread nicely, dip in hot water slightly 
salted, butter it, and lay on top of this toast an egg that has 
been broken into boiling water and cooked until the white is 
hardened. Season the egg with a bit of butter and a little 
salt. 

The best way to cook an egg for an invalid is to drop 
it into boiling water, or pour boiling water over the egg in 
the shell and let it stand a few minutes on the back of the 
stove. 



INVALID COOKING 201 

CREAM OF CELERY SOUP. 

Cook celery until soft, mash and rub through a sieve. 
This is celery puree. Add five or six drops of onion juice to 
the puree. Melt one level tablespoonful of butter, add the 
same amount of flour and cook together until frothy. To 
the flour and butter add one-fourth of a cupful of celery 
puree and one-half cupful of boiling water and cook together 
five minutes, then add one-fourth cupful of milk and the same 
of cream. Heat to 160 degrees Fah. and serve seasoned v^ith 
salt and pepper. 

GREEN PEA SOUP. 

Cook together as above one-half tablespoonful of butter 
and flour, add one-fourth cupful of hot milk, cook until it 
thickens a very little, add two level tablespoonfuls of cooked 
and strained pea-pulp, seasoned with one-eighth of a tea- 
spoonful of salt and one-fourth of a teaspoonful of sugar. 
You may add a little whipped cream. Serve hot. 

BEEF JUICE. 

Beef juice obtained from best round steak, which has 
been merely heated through over the coals, and then entirely 
deprived of soluble substances by a meat press, is the most 
concentrated form of liquid food. If prepared with the most 
scrupulous neatness from the best materials and served at 
once, it leaves nothing to be desired. To prepare the press 
for use in making the beef juice, it should stand in boiling 
water for thirty minutes. 

Take beef from upper part of round, broil over coals, hold- 
ing broiler close to the coals (when it is not possible to have 
coals it may be broiled on a very hot pan) until well browned. 



202 INVALID COOKING 

Now put pieces in the press that has been standing in hot 
water, and press out the juices into a cup standing in hot 
water. Season with a little salt and pepper, and it is ready 
to serve. It is often offered to a sick person in a red glass, 
that the color may not be offensive. It may be taken to the 
sick room in a bowl of hot water that it may be served 
hot. Hot water added, it becomes beef tea. 



CLAM BROTH. 

Procure clams in the shell, scrub the shells with a 
brush, put ten or twelve shells in a kettle with a very lit- 
tle hot water, cover kettle and let steam until shells open. 
Drain out the juice, dilute the broth with water and season 
with salt. 



IRISH-MOSS LEMONADE. 

Pick over and wash one-fourth of a cupful of Irish-moss, 
pour on one pint of boiling water and cook two hours, just 
below the boiling point, 200 degrees Fah. Strain and add 
lemon juice and sugar to taste. Excellent for bronchial 
troubles. 



EGG LEMONADE. 

Separate white from yolk of egg. Beat the yolk until 
stiff and creamy. Add the juice of one lemon, beat thorough- 
ly, add two level teaspoonfuls of sugar, fold in the white of 
the egg, beaten stiff and dry. Pour over shaved ice in a 
glass, let stand five minutes, and serve. The yolk may be 
omitted if too rich. 



INVALID COOKING 203 

GRUELS. 

Any kind of grain requires long, slow cooking. 

RICE GRUEL. 

Two level tablespoonfuls of cracked or crushed rice, two 
cupfuls of boiling salted water. Cook two hours over hot 
water. Strain out the grains and dilute with milk or cream. 
Serve hot or cold. It is delicious with whipped cream. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

One-half cupful of rolled or crushed oatmeal, the same 
amount of cold water. Stir well, let settle, and drain wa- 
ter into a stewpan. Repeat this four times; that is, add 
one-half cupful of cold water to the same oatmeal four times. 
Cook the strained water until thickened, directly over the 
fire. Now pour into the top of a double boiler and steam 
two hours, add salt, season with lemon juice, beef tea, cream 
or milk. 

EGG GRUEL. 

Separate the yolk and white of an egg, beat both very 
stiff, add a few drops of lemon juice to the yolk, add one 
tablespoonful, more or less, of sugar to the beaten white, 
fold the white into the yolk and pour over all one cup of 
heated milk, beating rapidly all the time. Flavor as desired. 

SOUPS. 

Milk soups are another way of serving hot milk, flavored 
with more or less pulp of the vegetables that grow above 
the ground, which are tender and rich in mineral substances. 
The milk should not be heated above 160 degrees Fah.

To clean sponges, wash them in diluted tartaric acid, 
rinsing them afterward in water; it will make them very soft 
and white. 

Before buying tinned fruits and meats see if the top is 
flat or depressed. If the top has bulged out, then air has 
entered the tin and fermentation set in. 

Vinegar should not be kept in a stone jar, as the acid 
may affect the glazing and the vinegar be rendered unwhole- 
some. Glass jars are the best vinegar receptacles. 

Freshen the house by putting a few drops of oil of laven- 
der in an ornamental bowl, then half fill it with very hot water. 
This will give a delightful freshness to the atmosphere. 

A good china cement is made by mixing with a strong so- 
lution of gum arable and water enough plaster of paris to make 
a thick paste. This should be applied to the broken edges 
with a camel's hair brush. 

When lighting a gas stove it will often give a slight 
explosion and light wrong, thus causing no heat. Turn the 
gas off very quickly, and on again. It will then light proper- 
ly without any further trouble.

If you have left boiled eggs in the water a little too 
long, break the top of the shell at once by patting it with a 
spoon. This lets out some of the heat, and the hardening proc- 
ess will be stopped immediately. 

A Paint-Stained Dress. — If you happen to get wet paint 
on your dress, rub the stain at once with another piece of the 
same material, and the stain will entirely disappear. You 
can use another and covered part of the same garment. What 
happens to the paint it is difficult to say, but it certainly 
vanishes. 

Grease Marks on Wall Papers. — These can be removed by 
applying a paste of pipeclay and water to the stains, and al- 
lowing this to dry on all one night or day. Then the powdev 
should be gently brushed off without scraping the paper. 

To Clean Carved Ivory Articles. — The beauty of carved 
ivory curios is frequently spoiled by the amount of dust which 
collects in the interstices, so those who possess them will be 
glad to hear of an excellent method of cleaning the ivory 
effectually. A paste should be made of sawdust, water and a 
few drops of lemon juice. This paste should be applied thick- 
ly all over the carving, and be permitted to dry on. When 
finally brushed off with a soft, firm brush, the preparation will 
be found to have left the ivory pure and white once more. 

To Remove Rust Stains from Matting. — Cover the stain 
v/ith paper and place a warm iron on this. When the spot is 
warm dip a glass rod in a bottle of muriatic acid and go over 
the rust spot with it, wetting every part with the acid. The 
spot will turn a bright yellow. Instantly wash it with an old 
toothbrush dipped in boiling water, rub dry with woolen 



206 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

cloths. Before beginning the work have all the appliances 
ready, and then work rapidly from start to finish. Muriatic 
acid corrodes metals, therefore keep the bottle corked tight 
when not using it. Two or three ounces of the acid will be 
ample. 

Flower vases can be easily purified and cleaned by rins- 
ing them out with warm water and powdered charcoal. 

When cutting new bread always put the knife in hot water 
first, and you will find that it facilitates the cutting. 

To Keep Clothespins New. — To prevent new clothespins 
from splitting, let them stand in cold water a few hours be- 
fore using. 

A box filled with lime and placed on the shelf in a pan- 
try and frequently renewed will absorb the damp, and keep the 
air pure and dry. 

When weighing molasses for cooking purposes, if the scale 
is well floured first the syrup will run off quite smoothly, 
without leaving any stickiness behind. 

Good Polish for Oilcloth. — Save all candle ends and melt 
in the oven; mix with it sufficient turpentine to make a soft 
paste. This is excellent for linoleum, etc. 

Celery should be allowed to lie in cold water, to which 
a little salt has been added, for an hour before it is re- 
quired for the table. This will make it very crisp. 

To Brighten Copperware. — A' little crushed borax if 
sprinkled thickly on a flannel cloth that is wet with hot water 
and well soaped will brighten the copper like magic.

To darken brown boots that have seen their best days rub 
all over with a piece of clean white flannel wet in ammonia. 
Do this twice, then polish with the usual brown liquid, and 
they will look as nice as ever. 

Tapestry-Covered Furniture. — To clean this, first brush 
thoroughly ; then add a tablespoonful of ammonia to a quart of 
water. Wring a cloth out of this, and sponge thoroughly, rins- 
ing and turning the cloth as it gets dirty, changing the water 
when necessary. This freshens and brightens it wonderfully. 

Scrubbing Board Floors. — Plenty of soap and cold water 
and no soda are the secrets of success in washing board floors, 
and the wood must be scrubbed the way of the grain and not 
round and round, if you want to get the dirt off. Change the 
water often. You can't expect boards to be a good color if 
they are rinsed in dirty water. 

Tissue paper should never be thrown away. Save it all 
up for polishing windows and mirrors, or for removing the 
first coating of grease from dishes previous to their immersion 
in the dishpan. 

Few housekeepers pay the attention they should to their 
ice boxes. An ice box can be kept in perfect condition if 
it is thoroughly cleansed once a week, but twice is better. 
The box should be thoroughly washed with strong soda water, 
and the drain pipes should be washed out. An ice box should 
always be full of ice, it is the poorest economy to allow the 
supply to decrease, and if sufficient ice is provided the box 
can be kept at an even temperature, which insures the pres- 
ervation of the food it contains. There are people who, from a 
false idea of economy, fail to get the best results from the 



208 THINGS WORTH KNOWING 

use of ice and refrigerators. A common mistake is getting 
a small piece of ice every day or every other day, instead of 
filling the ice chamber two or three times a week. The 
small piece of ice cannot reduce the temperature sufficiently 
and the result is that each new piece melts rapidly and the 
food cannot be kept. 

Never use soda for washing china that has any gilding 
on it, for the soda vv^ill in time surely remove it all. Instead 
of soda, use a little soap ; that has no bad effect. 

Put a teaspoonful of ammonia in a quart of water, wash 
your brushes and combs in this, and all grease and dirt will 
disappear. Rinse, shake, and dry in the sun, or by the fire. 

To renovate leather furniture, wash it with soap and water 
and when dry apply a little vaseline, rubbed in with the 
hand. Let it remain till next morning, then polish with a 
soft duster. This treatment will prevent the leather from 
cracking. 

Coal that is kept in a dry and airy place will burn much 
longer than that which is kept in a close cellar, with no 
ventilation. When coal remains long in an airless place it 
gets rid of its gas, and the absence of this renders it less 
powerful and more wasteful when burned. 

Carpets in rooms which are seldom used are apt to be at- 
tacked by moths. Salt sprinkled around the edges and well 
under the carpet before it is put down will generally prevent 
their ravages. Plenty of light and air should be admitted 
into the rooms, as moths favor close, dark places. 

Boots and shoes will last much longer if, when wet. 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 209 

they are placed on their sides and allowed to dry, pulling 
the uppers as flat as possible. By this means the soles are 
exposed to the air and dry better. It is also a good plan, 
when one does not possess boot-trees, to fill the boots or 
shoes with soft, crumpled paper or oats, so that they keep 
their shape. 

To prevent portieres catching under the door when opened 
quickly, screw a small ring (such as are used for picture 
frames) into the center of the door frame, to this fasten a 
blind cord sufficient to reach to the bottom of curtain. Put 
another ring in center of door at top, thread cord through, 
and fasten to bottom of curtain. As the door is opened so 
the curtain rises. 

To keep ants, moths or any other insects out of the closets 
or pantry, sprinkle the shelves and corners wtih sassafras oil, 
and they will soon bid you ''good-bye." 

A fairly sizable piece of black velveteen, perhaps a quarter 
of a yard, makes the most satisfactory brush for silk that 
can be had ; it removes the dust perfectly and yet does not 
injure the fabric. 

Care of Bath Rooms. — Plenty of fresh air and a generous 

flushing of pipes, using disinfectants every two weeks at 
least. Copperas is the very best ; dissolve a couple of pounds 
of crystals in a gallon of water, pouring a portion of it hot 
down the drains. It has no odor, but will stain any clothing, 
and must be used with care. 

For backache and pain in the chest the Belladonna and 
Capsicum plaster is the best and can be obtained at all drug 
stores.

DAINTY WAYS OF USING ROSE LEAVES. 

With the blooming of roses the woman who keeps abreast 
of the times is on the alert to gather in every leaf of the fra- 
srrant harvest. From time immemorial the Orientals have 
utilized roses for their choicest sweets and flavors. Our 
great grandmothers were adepts in the preparation of rose fla- 
vors and pot pourris, but the modern woman has been slow 
in awakening to their possibilities. 

The rose pillow is now esteemed the acme of daintiness 
for the new baby's carriage or the bride's outfit. 

To collect a sufficient supply, make a systematic tour of 
the garden each morning while the dew is still on, provided 
with basket and shears. Select the roses whose petals are 
ready to fall, shake into the basket, snip off the denuded stem 
and throw it away. Carry the fragrant burden to the garret 
or spare room, where papers have been spread upon the 
floor, and empty the petals upon them. Stir and turn every 
day until perfectly dry, transferring to bags when that is ac- 
complished. 

When a sufficient amount of petals has been collected, put 
in pretty cases made of fine hemstitched handkerchiefs fagot- 
ed together, through which white or rose-colored ribbon may 
be run. These wash beautifully. If something more elab- 
orate is desirable, a bolting cloth cover, embroidered or hand 
painted with roses, is dainty and effective. 

For rose syrup, collect fresh petals each morning and 
spread on a tray to dry. When enough have been collected for 
a tumbler of preserve, put in a fresh granite or porcelain 
kettle with just enough water to cover, and simmer until ten- 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 211 

der. Add sugar in the proportion of a pound to each pint of 
the leaves and water and cook to a rich syrup. The Turkish 
women frequently use honey in place of sugar, one-half pound 
of the honey equaling a pound of sugar. 

This syrup gives a delicious flavor to a pudding sauce or 
mince meat, or it may be utilized as a sweet at a Turkish 
tea. Pour in glasses and seal. 

To secure rose flavoring, fill a wide-mouthed bottle with 
fresh petals, packing them down as tight as possible. Then 
pour over them enough pure alcohol to submerge. 

Richer and stronger is rose brandy. Fill a glass jar with 
fragrant petals, and cover with French brandy. Next day 
pour off the brandy, take out the leaves and replace with fresh 
ones. Return the brandy. Do this several times, until the 
brandy is strongly impregnated. Then strain and bottle 
tightly. Keep the can covered during the distillation process. 

The petals of the yellow rose infused in boiling water 
furnish a delicate dye, which is attractive with old-fashioned 
rose desserts and for home-made candy. 

To make candied rose leaves, gather fresh leaves and 
spread them on an inverted sieve or oiled paper in the open 
air until slightly dry, but not crisp. Make a syrup, using 
a half pint of water and a half pound of granulated sugar, 
and boil until it spins a thread. Dip each rose leaf in this 
syrup, using a hat pin or fine wire. Then lay back in place. 
After several hours melt a half cupful of fondant, add two or 
three drops essence of rose, a drop of cochineal to color, and 
a few drops of water to thin. Dip the leaves in this one by 
one, sprinkle with crystallized sugar, and return to the oiled 
paper to harden.

To make calico wash well infuse three gills of salt in 
four quarts of boiling water, and put in the calicoes while 
hot, and leave them till cold. In this way the colors are 
rendered permanent and will not fade by subsequent washing. 

To remove paint and putty from window glass put suffi- 
cient saleratus into hot water to make a strong solution and 
with this saturate the paint or putty, which adheres to the 
glass. Let it remain till nearly dry, then rub off with a 
woolen cloth. 

To disinfect a room from the smell of tobacco or close- 
ness, place in an open mouthed jar one-half spirits of laven- 
der and a lump of salt of ammonia, leaving it uncovered. It 
is excellent. 

If our lady readers wish to keep a bouquet fresh let 
them drop a teaspoonful of powdered charcoal into the water 
intended for the flower stalks, and they will keep their 
freshness and perfume for several days, and look and smell 
the same as those just gathered. The charcoal settles to the 
bottom of the vase, the water remaining clear. 

For burns nothing excels linseed oil and lime water. Dip 
cotton in the lotion and apply to burn and bandage. 

Many jewels require an occasional sleep, in order to retain 
their brilliancy. Diamonds, rubies, opals and sapphires are 
among the number. They should be put away in total dark- 
ness every now and then. The usual velvet or satin lined 
cases are the correct receptacles. It is best to wrap them 
in jewelers' tissue paper, then pack them in wool and lay in 
air-tight compartments. A number of stones are seriously

affected by fumes from furnaces, sewer gas, moisture, and 
sea air. 

The effect of ammonia on vegetation is very beneficial. 
If you desire your plants to become more flourishing, try it 
upon them by adding six drops to every pint of water you 
give them. Do not repeat this oftener than once in eight 
days, lest you stimulate them too highly. 

Two pounds of alum dissolved in three quarts of boiling 
water and applied to all cracks and crevices will keep out 
ants, roaches and bedbugs. 

To clean straw matting, use a coarse cloth dipped in salt 
and water. Wipe dry. The salt will keep the matting from 
turning yellow. 

To remove ink stains, apply lemon juice and salt and lay 
the articles in the sun. 

No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of 
ammonia, for besides its medical value, it is very desirable 
for household purposes. With a pint of suds mix a teaspoon 
of spirits, dip in your silver knives, forks and spoons, and 
rub them with a brush and polish with a chamois skin. 

■ For washing mirrors and windows, put a few drops of am- 
monia on a piece of paper and it will readily take off every 
spot of finger marks on the glass. 

Ammonia entirely absorbs all obnoxious smell so often 
arising from the feet in hot weather. 

To take spots from wash goods, rub them well with the 
yolk of egg before washing.

Ammonia is a most refreshing agent at the toilet table. 
A few drops in a basin will make a better bath than pure 
water. 

To take white spots from varnished furniture, hold a hot 
plate over them and they will disappear. 

Salt will remove the stains from silver caused by eggs. 
Apply dry with a soft cloth. 

Never allow meat to remain in paper; it absorbs the 
juices. 

To prevent the odor of cabbage or onion, throw red pepper 
pods into the pan they are cooking in. 

A package of Gold Dust and a cake of Sapolio should be 
kept in every kitchen, to be used freely on all dishes that 
require scouring and cleansing. 

Salt will curdle new milk, hence in preparing milk por- 
ridge, gravies, etc., the salt should not be added until the 
dish is prepared. 

Salt and beeswax will make rusty flatirons as clean and 
smooth as glass. Tie a lump of wax in a bag and keep it for 
the purpose. When the irons are hot, rub them first with the 
wax bag, then scour them with a paper or cloth sprinkled 
with salt. 

Blue ointment and kerosene mixed in equal proportions 
and applied to the bedsteads is an unfailing bedbug remedy, 
as a coat of white wash is for the walls of a log house. 

Kerosene will soften boots or shoes that have been hard- 
ened by water and make them pliable as new.

When cheese becomes too hard, grate it and put it away 
in covered bottles ; it is useful for macaroni. 

Salt toughens meat if added before it is done. 

Crackers are much more crisp if set in a hot oven a few- 
minutes before serving. 

To brown flour, put a few tablespoonfuls of flour on the 
bottom of a baking dish, and stir until it has become brown. 
Bottle and keep for future use. 

If you value your own and your family's digestion, don't 
serve tea with fish. The tannic acid hardens the fiber and 
makes it indigestible. It should not be offered with any 
form of fish, shell-fish, or the articulate animals like lobsters 
and crabs. Iced tea and soft-shell crabs, for example, are 
a combination that should be avoided. 

One of the dyed chamois-skins is an excellent lamp mat 
for a polished table — the rich red, green, or a certain shade of 
peacock blue. A red one goes especially well with a lamp 
of Egyptian design. 

A recent addition to the list of savory salts is onion 
salt, which is now put up in shaker cans or bottles for flavor- 
ing use. 

As most of the people cook by gas perhaps the following 
suggestions may be a help in the saving of gas. Puddings, 
pies, and beans can be baked well at small expense by using 
a small tin oven, such as comes for oil stoves. Place the oven 
over one of the single burners, and you will find it will give 
a very satisfactory bake with only a low flame. This little 
oven is fine for keeping the dishes warm and the victuals 
hot.

If you wish to serve peas as an entree, cut out with a cookie 
cutter a round of bread from an ordinary sized slice of bread, 
then two rings with a doughnut cutter. Dip them in melted 
butter and toast delicately brown in the oven. Fill the cavities 
with peas cooked in a delicate cream sauce. 

Tissue paper should never be thrown away. Save it all up 
for polishing windows and mirrors. 

Never use soda for washing china that has any gilding 
on it, for the soda will in time surely remove it all. Instead 
of soda, use' a little soap; that has no bad effect. 

Put a teaspoonful of ammonia in a quart of water, wash 
your brushes and combs in this, and all grease and dirt will 
disappear. Rinse, shake, and dr}^ in the sun, or by the fire. 

Ink spots on mahogany may be removed by being touched 
with a feather dipped in oil of vitriol diluted with twice its 
quantity of water. The spot should be well and quickly 
rubbed. 

To renovate leather furniture, wash it with a little soap- 
and-water, and when dry apply a little vaseline, rubbed in 
with the hand. Let it remain till next morning, then polish 
with a soft duster. This treatment will prevent the leather 
from cracking. 

A few drops of oil of lavender in a silver bowl or orna- 
mental dish of some kind, half filled with very hot water, and 
set in the dining-room just before dinner is served, gives a de- 
lightful and intangible freshness to the atmosphere of the 
apartment. Hostesses often put a small vessel in the parlor 
and dressing-rooms when arranging the house for a festivity. 
The suggestion is especially valuable to the hostess in a small 
apartment, which sometimes in the bustle of preparation be- 
comes stuffy.

Household Uses for Pure Refined Paraffine Wax. 

For Washing — One-half teacup of Paraffine Wax shavings 
to one ordinary bar of washing soap, both dissolved in a little 
hot water, is sufficient for one boiler of washing. Pour this 
mixture when dissolved into the boiler of hot water (the best 
results are obtained by dipping the clothes into cold water 
then wringing and putting into the boiler). Boil the clothes 
thirty minutes, after which all that is required to have beauti- 
ful, white clothes is the usual sudsing, rinsing and bluing. Us- 
ing Paraffine Wax as above will save hard rubbing and scrub- 
bing. Will take the dirt out of your clothes without hard 
rubbing. Absolutely pure and will not injure the most delicate 
fabrics. Has no taste or odor. Just as important as soap for 
laundry Avork. 

For Ironing — A teaspoon of MELTED Paraffine Wax 
mixed with the hot starch insures a smooth, glossy finish. 

Irons are kept smooth, bright and clean by rubbing them 
over small pads made of Paraffine Wax covered with cheese- 
cloth or old linen. 

For Sealing Preserves — When the jam or jelly is cool, wipe 
the inside rim of the glass with a cloth to insure perfect clean- 
liness ; then pour in the melted Paraffine Wax until it is about 
one-fourth of an inch thick. Let stand until the Wax hardens 
and turns white. No other cover is necessary. If the fruit is 
thoroughly cooled before pouring on the melted Wax it will 
not mix with the fruit. 

For Cake and Pie Pans — Warm the pans and rub the in- 
side with Paraffine Wax. This is superior to the old method 
of greasing the pans with butter.

Do not throw away bits of toilet soap. Get a quart or 
pint Mason jar and put in the bits of soap. Pour in alcohol 
not quite enough to cover the soap. This will make a jelly 
which will be found very useful for the hands, in the bath, 
and for shampooing. Just before using add three drops of 
lavender or rose. 

To prevent flannels from turning yellow lay pieces of 
white wax in the folds of white flannel or Swiss muslin. 

The following are a few of the many articles which should 
be in every household in case of emergency — especially if a 
doctor is not to be obtainable immediately. Absorbent cotton, 
bandages of convenient length and width of old cotton (which 
every housekeeper has if carefully saved), old linen hand- 
kerchiefs, pieces of soft flannel, prepared mustard leaves, 
adhesive plasters, arnica, pure vaseline, Collodion, Witch- 
hazel, ammonia, borax, ipecac, spirits camphor, aconite No. 3 
labeled "poison." No. 2 is invaluable in the household if ad- 
ministered carefully in fever, ten drops in a glass of water, 
dose one teaspoonful each hour. Pure wine, whiskey, or 
brandy if occasion requires. 

The hot water bags are indispensable (and can be obtained 
at slight cost). One per cent solution of carbolic acid is very 
useful (also a deadly poison) in cases of injury because of its 
cleansing qualities. If a cut is to be treated, the wound 
should be cleansed in clear tepid water, then rinsed with the 
carbolic solution, then painted with collodion, which staunches 
the blood and serves as a varnish to keep out air and any dirt. 

The solution of carbolic above mentioned is excellent for 
burns ; saturate the cotton and put on to the afflicted spot, 
bandage and keep wet. 



THINGS WORTH KNOWING 219 

Trifling injuries, whether cuts or tears, should be gently 
cleansed with luke warm water poured over the wound, then 
replace the skin or tissue, and lay a clean white cloth soaked 
in laudanum, or alcohol, or water over the injured part and 
loosely bind on. 

Aromatic spirits of ammonia should never be allowed to 
run low, as its uses are so many, especially where there are 
any persons in the family with a tendency to fainting spells, 
or weak heart, as it facilitates the heart action, and is less 
dangerous than liquor. In case of fainting, a small teaspoon- 
ful in a half glass of water may be given, and the patient 
placed on the floor on his back, with the head low, garments 
loosened about neck, chest, waist, etc. Sprinkle water on the 
face, and hold smelling salts or spirits of camphor under the 
nose. Care should be taken, however, not to hold it too near, 
and produce strangling — but first of all lay the person on the 
back and the head slightly lower than the body. After a faint 
a slight stimulant in hot water, either 15 drops of aromatic 
spirits of ammonia, or a very little wine or whiskey in water, 
may be useful. 

Bleeding from extracting a tooth. — Press a plug of cotton 
over the cavity, holding it firmly there. Salt and water is 
also useful. 

Splints. — Great ingenuity may be used in this matter. 
When a sudden emergency arises, pasteboard, shingles, a piece 
of a cigar box, or anything smooth and stiff may be used, and 
it should be padded to make it as comfortable as possible. 

For Fractures. — Use cloths wet in cold water immediately, 
to prevent as far as possible the swelling, which naturally fol- 
lows soon after the accident. This will assist the doctor.

Vinegar is a sure and swift antidote for carbolic acid 
poison. It has been stated that there are more accidental 
deaths from poisonous acids than any other poisonous drugs. 
The antidote is common cider vinegar, which is to be found in

CONSTIPATION. 

For children glycerine suppositories infants' size ; for 
adults one fig before breakfast or prunes stewed with senna 
tea are often very efficient. 

EAR-ACHE. 

Sweet almond oil as hot as it can be borne, dropped into 
ear. Chloroform on swab ; rub behind and in front of ear.

One quart of flour, sifted twice; three eggs, the whites and 
yolks beaten separately, three teacups of 
sweet milk, a teaspoonful of salt, a table- 
spoonful of sugar, a large tablespoonful of 
lard or butter and two heaping teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder. Sift together 
flour, sugar, salt and baking powder; rub 
in the lard cold, add the beaten eggs 
and milk; mix quickly into a smooth 
batter, a little firmer than for griddle 
cakes. Grease well some muflin-pans and 
fill them two-thirds full. Bake in a hot 
oven fifteen or twenty minutes. These made of cream, omit- 
ting the butter, are excellent.
