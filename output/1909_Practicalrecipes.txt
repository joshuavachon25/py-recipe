PRACTICAL RECIPES 
Soups 



LILL:ii»S RECIPE FOR SOUP 
STOCK 

3 pounds of lean beef ; 1 pound bone ; 5i quarts 
cold water; 2 oz. salt; 2 carrots; 3 large onions 
stuck with 4 cloves; 1 head of celery; 1 small 
parsnip; sprig of parsley. Simmer for 5 hours, 
skimming carefully from time to time. Never 
allow it to boil. Strain and set aside to cool. 
Next day remove all fat, and if the jelly is not 
perfectly clear, mix with it the beaten whites of 
3 eggs. Boil quickly for one minute, remove

TOM^lTO SOUP

1 quart tomatoes (fresh or canned) ; 2 large 
onions browned in 2 tablespoons of butter. Put

PRACTICAi; RECIPES 

the onions into the tomatoes and cook 15 minutes, 
with plenty of salt and pepper. Run through a 
colander, have ready a plate of bread spread with 
butter thickly and place a slice on each plate and 
turn a large ladle of the mixture (previously 
made very hot) over it. If not for a Friday 
soup add one pint of soup stock. 

LEEK SOUP. 

(Also for Fridayy 

4 large leeks ; 4 large potatoes ; 1 quart water 
(or soup stock) ; 1 cup butter, season highly with 
salt and pepper. Boil until smooth and put 
through a colander. 

FRENCH LENTEN SOUP 

Put into saucepan butter the size of an egg; 
when smoking hot add 2 large onions sliced thin, 
and cook thoroughly until they redden ; then add 
gradually a tea cup of sifted flour. Brown very 
lightly, but do not permit to bum, then add 
slowly 1 pint of boiling water, a little pepper, 
celery seed and salt. Boil a few minutes, then 
pour into soup kettle and just before serving add 
1 pint of cream and 1 pint of milk and 2 me- 



SOUPS 



dium sized potatoes, mashed, which have been 
carefully thinned with the soup before adding. 
Serve with small dice of fried bread. 

OLD-FASHIONED SOUP 

Procure a soup bone of any size desired, cover 
with cold water, salt to taste, and boil until ten- 
der; remove meat from kettle; pare and cut in 
small pieces potatoes, onions and carrots, if de- 
sired; add mixed spices tied in a cloth; when 
vegetables are well cooked, have this mixture for 
dumplings ready: 1 pint flour, 1 teaspoon 
baking powder and a pinch of salt, mixed to a 
dough with water; boil rapidly for five or seven 
minutes in a closed kettle. If soup is not thick 
enough, add a tablespoon of flour dissolved in a 
little milk. 

GOOD POTATO SOUP 

Wash and pare potatoes and put enough water 
over them to have about a pint, when done, for 
soup; cook rapidly, as potatoes should be well 
mashed up through it; when the potatoes are 
cooked, add 1 pint of milk, butter the size of a 
walnut, pepper and salt to taste; add a little 
thickening if necessary. One or two small onions

flavor, if one likes onions. 

PUREE OF POTATOES

onion sliced; 3 stalks of celery cut fine; 3 tfible- 
spoons butter. Cook in 4 cupfuls of beef stock 
until potatoes are done. Press through colan- 
der; add 2 cups sweet cream, 1 teaspoon of but- 
ter; 1 tablespoon chopped parsley, re-heat and 
serve. 

BOUILLON

one large tablespoon of butter, rub into it a des- 
sertspoon of flour, set this on the fire and stir 
it while melting and until the butter has a rich 
golden brown. Season with salt and pepper, pour

FROZEN PUDDING 

1' pint of rich milk; 2 cups of sugar (pow- 
dered) ; 1! cup of boiled rice ; 2 tablespoons of 
gelatine; 1 quart of rich cream; 1 pound of can- 
died cherries; 4 tablespoons of best sherry wine. 

Boil the milk and thicken with the rice, stir- 
ring constantly for 15 minutes. Add gelatine 
while hot and permit it to get cool before add- 
ing cream and sherry. Freeze 10 minutes before 
adding wine, then add wine and stir in thoroughly 
and freeze altogether, and turn out the same as 
ice cream. If not frozen carefully, it will not be 
so delicate, as you do not want it stiff and hard. 



WINE JELLY XSHERRY) 

1 box of gelatine soaked in i a pint of cold 
water; 1 pint of fine sherry wine; the juice and 
thin cuts of three lemons; a trifle more than IJ 
of cube sugar, scant pint of boiling water. The 
whites and shells of 4 eggs, well beaten. Small

through a fine strainer. The rind of the lemon 
must be cut in the thinnest possible cuts from the 
peel; these thin cuts take only the little globules 
of oil from the lemons, which is very delica^te in 
flavor. The cinnamon adds much to the color. 
After stirring well, quickly put in a porcelain ket- 
tle and let boil hard for one minute, without stir- 
ring, then set the kettle back on the range to 
settle, skim ofF the scum very carefully and pour 
easily through a jelly bag. Flannel bags are 
the proper kind for wine jelly. This jelly should 
be entirely clear. If the first straining is not 
clear, strain a second time, always pouring very 
slowly through the bag. This recipe is splendid.

ORANGE BLOSSOM PAISTILLES 
{Mrs. J. R.) 

Boil one hundred and twenty-five grammes of 
white sugar in three tablespoons of water until 
it forms little globules, when dropped in a cup of 
cold water. Now throw in thirty-one grammes of 
fresh orange flower petals and allow to cook until 
sugar becomes brittle. Drop it on white paper 
the size of a dollar piece. Remove froip paper 
the moment they take their forms. 

If the quantities indicated above are not suffi- 
cient to fill dish, so proceed in the same way for 
as many as one needs. If greater proportions are 
used the sugar would become solid before the 
preparation could be put on the paper. One can 
use fewer orange blossoms if desired.

PRACTICAL RECIPES 

RASPBERRY JAM 

Add one pint of currant juice to every 4 pounds 
of fruit. Boil for half an hour, stirring and skim- 
ming well. Dip out most of the juice and add the 
sugar, and boil 20 minutes longer. 

TUTTI FRUTTI PRESERVES 

This preserve is a most delicious as well as an 
unusual one, and has the merit of being econom- 
ical besides, inasmuch as it utilizes small quanti- 
ties of fruit which might otherwise be thrown 
away. For this purpose can be used any and all 
kinds of fruits, beginning with the strawberry 
and adding each in its turn until the end of the 
season. For an ordinary sized family, start a 
2 gallon stone jar early in June, with one quart 
of white preserving brandy. Add the fruit as 
you have it, always putting in an equal amount 
of sugar, and keep well stirred from the bottom. 
For example, if you begin with a quart of straw- 
berries, also add a quart of sugar. If at some 
time you put in a cupful of fruit left over from 
dinner, add a cupful of sugar also. The brandy 
perfectly preserves the fruit and the mixture of 
flavors gives an exceedingly delicious result. Add 
pranges apd lemons cut up with the peel, water- 
15B 



MARMALADE AND PRESERVES 

melon rind, stoned raisins, pineapple, cherries, and 
in fact every variety of fruit. The preserve being 
a very rich one, it will be found excellent put in 
ice cream and frozen, as well as to be used separ- 
ately. Some maraschino added to the brandy or 
any other liquor improves the flavor very much. 
After the jar is filled, it must be stood away for 
several months, or a full year, in order that the 
flavors may become blended and harmonious. In- 
deed about Christmas is a good season for open- 
ing the jar, whin it adds greatly to the pleasures 
of the holiday menus.

Hints to Young House- 
keepers 



A clean kitchen and plenty of useful utensils 
are necessities. 

All fish should be cleaned as soon as brought 
from market, washed thoroughly and put in 
strong salt and water for half an hour, then dried 
on clean towel, sprinkled with pepper and put in 
ice chest until ready to cook. Poultry and birds 
should be treated in the same way. 

Vegetables should be looked over, washed and 
placed in cold water until time to cook, as soon as 
brought from market. 

Milk should never be placed in a compartment 
of an ice chest with anything else but butter. 

Cucumbers should be pared and thrown into 
iced water until time to serve, when they should be 
sliced, not too thin, and never be put in salt and 
water. 

A piece of charcoal put in the pot with cauli- 
flower or cabbage will prevent odor. 

In buying turkeys always select young hens to 
175 



PRACTICAL RECIPES 

weigh 7 or 8 pounds. If for more than 7 people 
provide two turkeys so everyone can have their 
choice, and if some is left over for next day, so 
much the better. Always put the carcass in the 
soup kettle. 

In boiling chickens, turkeys, lamb, mutton, 
corned beef, or pickled tongue, use boiling water. 
Making soup or boiling smoked tongue, use cold 
water, also ham and leave it in the water it was 
cooked in all night. The first water should be 
thrown away and fresh cold water, enough to 
cover it, be put in the kettle to finish cooking it. 

In using sour milk for cake or biscuit, use car- 
bonate of soda, teaspoon to one pint of sour milk. 
In using sweet milk, soda and cream of tartar or 
baking powder, never both. 

To beat whites of eggs quickly add a pinch of 
salt. 

To keep cake from sticking to bottom of pan, 
sprinkle pan with flour lightly after rubbing it 
with butter. 

1 level teaspoon of soda is enough for one pint 
of sour milk. 

In recipes calling for 1 teaspoon of soda and 
2 of cream of tartar, baking powder can be used 
instead, using 3 teaspoons. 

Always order veal kidneys. 

176 



TO YOUNC HOtTSEItEEPEflS 

Always cut several slits in the top crust of 
chicken or meat pie to let out the steam. 

Four or five common playing marbles in the bot- 
tom of a kettle of boiling fruit juice by their 
constant motion will prevent scorching and make 
unnecessary constant stirring.
