PREFACE 

In presenting to the public this book on INTERNATIONAL 
DESSERT AND PASTRY SPECIALTIES we feel that we are pre- 
senting ^he most complete authoritative and up-to-date book ever 
preparec. on the subject. The contributors being the finest chefs in 
the United States, Canada and Europe insure every recipe shown 
as right. These world famous chefs have given us their special 
recipes and they have made the explanations so plain and so complete 
that any one can readily understand them. 

The great chefs who have prepared these recipes for us have 
all made cooking their life work and have been apprenticed under the 
finest and most practical teachers in the culinary lines in this country 
and abroad. 

A large portion of the copy has been translated from the French. 
The finest chefs are generally the French or Swiss. They are not 
literary men; their language is not flowery, but we know that even with 
the diflficulty that exists in expressing in English many of the French 
terms that the work as a whole will be easily understood and greatly 
appreciated. 

This is the first time in history that such a wonderful collection 
of recipes have been made obtainable for general use. These men 
are giving, in these recipes, their "professional secrets." The calibre 
of the men who have prepared these recipes is great and represents as 
much as the great masters in other lines of the world's work. Napoleon 
Bonaparte was a great general; Shakespeare, a great author; George 
Washington, a wonderful statesman; and Thomas Edison, a masterful 
inventor: — but we feel that the master chefs represented here are to be 
considered just as great and doing just as much of the world's work as 
any of the famous men we have all been taught to revere and respect. 

The International Cooking Library, covering in ten volumes, every 
conceivable part, section or angle of the cooking question makes it 
possible for any one who wiU follow these recipes to be an expert cook. 
The great masters who have prepared these recipes have spent their 

8 




TnElRCHER/OURCONTRIBUTORi"! 



lives studying and experimenting and are giving in these recipes their 
best ideas and suggestions. These are dishes of the millionaires and 
the most particular epicureans. 

We feel that this set of books is presented to the public at just 
the opportune time. All people are beginning to realize that there is 
really no more important art than cooking and this should be so; for 
what should be considered more important than what we eat? The 
best health insurance is having the right kind of foods, properly 
prepared. A man is at his best only when he is in robust health and 
nothing will undermine a person's constitution so quickly as poor 
food. The best dishes and the sure and absolute recipes for making 
them, are contained in this wonderful set of books. All the copy 
is from authorities just as positive and just as sure in this 
line as the noted Blackstone was on legal lines. We picked the best 
chefs in the world; we would accept copy from no others. 

A careful study of the recipes and careful application of the 
directions for same is all that is necessary to produce the results 
that have made these men famous. 

In the presentation of this book, we wish only that space would 
allow us to mention and pay courtesy to the many men who have assisted 
us in the various departments, copy preparation, translation, and 
editing, also the courtesies rendered by the managers of the world 
renowned hotels whose chefs have been our contributors.

Lecture on Dainties — Desserts 

By 

Emile Bailly, Chef de Cuisine 
Hotel St. Regis, New York City

indulgence in the English wording as it is almost impossible to give 
French meaning

DAINTIES 

''The work and the right to be man — and 
man is as necessary as the sun is to nature." 

I like to make myself agreeable and useful 
to the subject that I have proposed to treat. 
Unfortunately I am no more orator than literary 
man and my prose and my words have nothing of 
brilliancy; also I ask the indulgence of the 
auditor and readers. This subject does not 
appear very much at first glance; despite all 
that it is all a seance and poetry for the eyes, a 
delight for the "Palace of Dainties." The word 
itself is already charming the unfinished without 
a limit; like music, like poetry, it has its funda- 
mental rules which under the transgressor to 
find the daintiest and most exquisite that come 
out of an artist's hands, although the idea, the 
taste and I don't think I say too much if I call 
it the genius of the creator of these small marvels, 
who multiplies and improves them every day. 
Their place is everywhere, but they are in want 
of ordonation; it is not their volume that elevates 
them, but it is their delicacy, their modest and refinement of compo- 
sition. They, like the birds of the forest, the flowers in the 
prairie and like their sister of modesty, "The Violet," in color and 
perfume, are forms of endless limit. Look at the sumptuous buffet,

EMILE BAILLY, 

CHEF DE CUISINE 

HOTEL ST. REGIS 

New York City, N.Y. 

Mr. Bailly _ prior to 
coming to this country 
served in the very best 
hotels in Europe. He 
left the Grand Hotel 
of Monte Carlo, France 
ten years ago, to come 
to New York and open 
the St. Regis. 




Their l/pecial Desserts 



modest like well behaved little girls neighboring with the pheasant 
with its noted plumage, decorated; the lobsters in cardinal robes, like 
acrobats clinging to a flower bedecked bar. Inspite of all this do 
you wish for a prettier scene? Enchanted by the tunes and move- 
ments of the waltz looking at you invitingly so to say — taste me, I 
am exquisite. 

Has the ''Dainty" not the most unthankful place in a dinner? 
Of course, at times she is dished up on the table on a golden platter 
or antique china. They are always the last served. It is their gentle- 
ness, their engaging expression, their goodness that makes them to be 
forgotten in the palace already criticized; through the excellency of 
viands, also that of wines, which are perfect and desirable. They are 
generally more appreciated by the ladies who are gourmands and 
gourmets. Nature has created them to be delicate, not only bodilj^ 
but for taste, as a woman is not complete if she does not like sweetness 
and refined dishes. 

If the dainties were like the serpent that lost our first mother, 
Eve, take for granted that our father, Adam, would not have com- 
plained. When one reads the works of our predecessors one encounters 
the side of the simple idea, the genial side which slowly but surely 
advanced to the perfection attained today. 

The honey is the first of all the sweetnesses and always will be 
appreciated; still nowadays lots of honey is used for the making of 
pastries, but to talk about this would lead me too far into the subject of 
confectionery and it would not be any more a talk, but a book which 
should be written. ''Talking About Honey," — I remember a story 
that dates back before the flood. It is one of the rare tales that has 
been handed down to posterity until it reached us. It is reviewing 
the time elapsed and you will surely be a little bit surprised as its 
reflection will show you that it is only natural. Everybody knows 
that the bear is fond of honey, and that his gluttony is what makes him 
steal, the discovery of which gives us the birth of the "Pastry", the 
mother of the "Dainties". Yes, despite his heavy steps and little refined 
manners, the bear is an epicurean. Of course, this will not tell you the 
story, but there you are. Once in some part of the world there was a 
family composed of father, mother and several children, especially a 
gentle little girl, and they were trying to settle somewhere. One day 

15 



the father returned from a hunt with a wounded bear which he kept 
because it was young and inclined to be sociable and showed a certain 
amount of affection, i)articularly toward the little girl who looked 
after it and fed it with fruit and herbs. When his wounds had healed 
he went out to hunt and retiu-ned often with his snute full of honey and 
fragments of the comb. By making motions with his head he tried to 
make the girl understand that he wanted her to taste. She understood 
and what a ]oj of delightful flavor of honey it was. It was a newly 
added flavor of dame nature to the family. 

The pastry cooking has made wonderful progress ever since. The 
lubber of a bear has taught and his gluttony given birth to the grand- 
mother of the delicate dainties. I am now coming back to my subject 
again to give you technical explanations concerning the confectionery 
of the gentle " Bon Bons " that we so dearly love. As I mentioned before 
the variety is inexhaustible and all it needs is sugar, eggs, flour, almonds, 
hazelnuts, walnuts, cocoa, fruits, perfumes and colors. 

Now what have we learned from all this? Is it necessary to know 
without any actual experience which guides us and also permits us to 
make all these mixtures of master hands and do it with judgment? 
Also is it necessary to know how to manipulate the style of well reasoned 
"bon bon of acquaintances," also the years of experience and above 
all the taste? 

Daily, new names are created. It is the necessity of change, but 
friandines (dainties), the characteristic word which the French 
language gives us so rich in the sphere of gastronomy, especially the 
interpretation of terms, despite the great vanity, but it is what we 
term as '' mignon " or " neat." In reviewing a world composed of names, 
flowers, marquises, duchesses, artists, poets, musicians, famous war- 
riors and ambassadors, one has an epoch, a real encyclopedia of the 
past and present to dream of. Why do these names tell you the 
reason of that application as culinary terms? Well that is very simple, 
as each epoch knows the taste of those whose names are used or the 
preference of the name to celebrate an anniversary or to honor a host 
of etiquette. If one would want to trace and review all these names 
it would comprise the whole histor5^ The table of diplomats, is it not 
worth while to preserve their names in honor of their everlasting 
taste? The squires don't exist any more and their kitchens and cook- 

16 




Their lTpecial Dessertj 




ing has been changed. But even since one smokes at the table and 
the ladies join the men, the good table and good manners have 
been revised. I will not go too far away from my subject but will 
simply state the fact that time will judge, but it is no credit to a good 
education to smoke at the table and that the rule of the woman is so 
beautiful it should never change. 

See the modest and gentle "Dainty", is she jealous of the fat fillet 
of beef or stuffed turkey? Why? Because she knows her place and 
duty. Sometimes these things give people lessons in moderation, if 
this is the case. If you will kindly search through this point of my 
conversation you will see how many terms are just and of actuality. 
When you nibble on these delicious dainties, their quality is a delight 
to a badly balanced mind. Some day, perhaps, some one will tell you 
that in order to be up-to-date you will have to eat the desserts with the 
soup as any amount of abnormities are committed nowadays, but they 
don't surprise me a bit. How many of our predecessing gourmets 
would be happy to review the changes as we have the chance to; the 
progress of time, the accomplishment of the art of eating or of knowing 
how to eat. 

It is very sad to state that the question of eating and drinking has 
arrived at the point where it injures the health of the most robust, not 
permitting him to sacrifice a little time to spend at the table. 

I think I can hear the murmurs of the stomach that bears the secret 
of King Midas. The poor fellow had donkey's ears. With me it is 
not the same that Zephir brought me; he said to me, ''Friend, this is the 
fashion; come in time to eat." This is the horror of the twentieth 
century. I have a certain evidence but only as far as my fabrication 
of dainties is concerned. This is my part of the menu, but a menu 
complete is from the '*Hors d'oeuvre" (relishes) to "Dainties." How 
many have I seen lost for the want of waiting? The cold kitchen has 
the patience and knows how to wait without changing its humor and 
remain serviceable to the opportune moment. 

I have seen many ladies that flattered me, especially on account of 
my proteges the "delicious dainties." If you will remember in only 
one instance I told you that I would explain to you through the menu 
the manipulation of these good little things and despite all I have con- 
tinued by babbling. Excuse me, perhaps I am not modest enough, but 

17 




i j World F amo u s C he^ 



it seems that you are paying a sustained attention to my conversation. 
I am glad to say that I am pleased with that and it is the atmosphere 
of sympathy that makes me talk so much. 

I am amidst another life full of impressions. For me to take my 
first step into the public seems like a big hall with lots of open 
window^s, the sun and the air striking me. How much I regret not being 
able to find words strong enough to express my appreciation ot having 
the good fortune to serve you. I hardly think that a second opportu- 
nity will offer itself to me; — to be able to tell the whole world the senti- 
ments of those who make these ''delights of the palace." We are also 
artists like the great master painters, musicians, composers and other 
artists. We make something out of little. Like masters of old we are 
happy to leave our masterpieces of work with pleasure; only to start 
over again tomorrow. I also believe that we want courage and will 
power to accomplish our daily tasks. These are the difficulties that 
represent more or less of the artist's soul, the different sensations, inex- 
plicable, as seen by the soul's eyes and dreams during sleepless 
nights, searching for the realization of the dream. It is an error 
of belief that artists are only seen on the stage. That is just 
where you find the smallest number. It is nature that created 
the artist, born with the sentiment which is voluntarily developed 
without effort and pierces through all acts of life. This is the 
greatest sensibility, invisible, which guides you by nature to your 
planned destination. To help, not any more than to reproduce, as 
nature is the artist of excellency, unimitable, but to us makers of good 
things, gives her aid to accomplish the deeds of the most delicate and 
finest art. She gives us the good sense to utilize her products so num- 
erous, and to accomplish confectionery without discarding her laws. 
Through her wisdom she has foreseen each country, its products, con- 
cordant its climate with its habitants, to give us health and strength, 
which create wealth and permit a happy life. Our art is one of luxury, 
but indispensable. As long as humanity will act in good faith, its 
future is to be congratulated, that every one of us will have sufiicient 
to satisfy the stomach that digests well, giving a clear brain and a good 
sociable character. See those ill-tempered people who are dissatisfied 
with themselves,— search for the cause of it. It is their shattered, 
decayed stomachs, not the bad cooking or the bonbons.

Look at the ostriches eating stones and other indigestible things 
and they have, in spite of all, pretty good humor. I would be happy 
if I could write a few lines on "How to eat and drink and appreciate 
good bonbons," which through the quality, fineness and purity of 
the merchandise used, are digestive; but one must know how 
to choose, as it is not quantity but quality that counts. 

Take bonbons that you see in the shop windows, sold for little, 
(hey are bad, very bad, carrying germs of all descriptions, disorganizing 
the system. Therefore choose quality before quantity. Now we have 
arrived at the technical. I will give you the necessary recipes of the 
confectionery of dainties, that is, pastries, meringues, creams, etc., 
with which it is possible to make an unlimited quantity of dainties 
which are followed by corresponding recipes of principals before 
mentioned. I hope that what follows will be sufficient to make 
those forget, who have found the entry of the matter too long. 

FOURS GLACES AU PARFUM DES FLEURS, NOYANT 
FRUITS ET LIGNEURS 

(Dainty cakes flavored with flowers, nuts, fruits or liquors) 

This variety of dainties is very simple and excellent. Take 
genoise biscuit cut in cubes the size or thickness of a thumb (inch), 
spread with a butter cream the same for glazing or frosting. That is 
to say a dainty a la Rose must be flavored with essence of roses, also 
colored accordingly. Put in small paper cases and a crystallized rose 
petal on top, the same with violets, etc. The latter mentioned must 
be caramelized beiore placing on top of dainty. Same way with 
liquors or cordials. For fruit flavors use marmalades of respective 
fruits frosted with clear frosting and little fruit paste on top. As 
I said in my conversation, cut in cubes, because it is the most 
economic way for several reasons, especially when one desires the 
dainties not too sweet. Supreme the cream in butter, flavor slightly 
with the liquor or cordial and glaze simply with corresponding flavors. 

GENOISE OR GENOA CAKE 
Mix in a basin, one-half pound sugar, grated peel of one lemon, 
four eggs, one-half pound sifted flour, small pinch of salt; melt one- 

19 



half pound of butter, pour into paste and mix thoroughly with a wooden 
spoon. Put in a buttered oblong mould and bake for three-fourths 
of an hour; turn it out and let cool. 

BISCUIT PASTE 
Beat ten eggs firm and smooth and add gradually one pound
